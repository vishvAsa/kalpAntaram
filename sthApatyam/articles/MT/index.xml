While he did not belong to the traditional high varNa-s, he was still eligible to set up ritual fires for certain practices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was also counted among the ratnin-s, who were functionaries of the royal entourage. He evidently embodied the key technical knowledge of the Indo-Aryan – the making of chariots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;pancharatrika-role&#34;&gt;pAncharAtrika role&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is notable that his technical role as an engineer continued into the second urbanization of India. This is illustrated by a reference to him as an acolyte of the pa&lt;del&gt;ncharAtrika AchArya, with knowledge of architecture, in a pa&lt;/del&gt;ncharAtra vaiShNava temple manual:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
