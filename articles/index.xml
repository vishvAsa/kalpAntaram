      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1741872288801452328.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Manusmriti chapter 9, there is discussion about what the texts call Mahapatakas- great crimes that brings upon great Paapam (karmic demerit) to the performer and causes injury to society. These include murder, stealing, adultery, etc. In this context Manu says that the perpetrators if they refuse to perform expiation, they must be banished after confiscating all their property.  In this context, the text adds following verses:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;King shall not appropriate property of man guilty of heinous crime; if, through greed he takes it, he becomes tainted with that guilt—9.243&lt;br&gt;&#xA;He shall deposit such property in water &amp;amp; offer it to Varuṇa or bestow it on a Brāhmaṇa endowed with Vedic learning and character—9.244&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Hence, the eldest son in a Namboothiri Brahmin household performed Pitr Karma to his paternal uncles along with his father.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
