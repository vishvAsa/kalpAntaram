Whenever we think of the scripturally ordained dharmas, the sheer detail with which they have been mentioned, makes them seem very difficult to perform. Such a view may discourage a layperson from accepting the teachings given in the sacred scriptures of *Sanātana* Dharma, such as the *Dharmaśāstras*. But is this view correct? Do the *Dharmaśāstras* intend to put us into great difficulties by asking us to perform our dharmas? This leads to another question; should dharma be difficult to perform? In this article, I shall try to find an answer to these questions based on what the *Dharmaśāstras *\(along with their traditional commentaries\) and *Purāṇas* say, or intend to say on this matter. 

In the texts of *Dharmaśāstras* such as *Manusmṛti*, *Yājñavalkyasmṛti* and so forth, dharma has been divided into two main categories, that is, *sāmānya* \(common\) and *viśeṣa* \(specific\). The *sāmānya* is common to all humans, whereas the *viśeṣa* is for people who belong to specific categories. For example, a *Brāhmaṇa* householder is told to perform the dharmas specifically ordained for him, based on being both a *Brāhmaṇa* and a householder. Dharma means an activity, performing which, one will receive *puṇya* \(unseen merit\). So, when every human performs any of those *sāmānya* dharmas, he or she will receive *puṇya*, as per the *Dharmaśāstras*. 

Apart from the other *sāmānya* dharmas, such as *ahiṃsā* \(abstinence from violence which is not permitted by the scriptures\), *satya* \(speaking the truth which is also beneficial for others\), and so forth, there is another dharma which finds mention in the *Bṛhaspatismṛti*, and also in various *Purāṇas*. This dharma is ' *anāyāsa*'. 

> *dayā kṣamā''nasūyā ca  
śaucānāyāsa-maṅgalam* | 
*akārpaṇyam aspṛhatvaṃ  
sarva-sādhāraṇāni tu* || 

- *Bṛhaspatismṛti*, *Saṃskārakāṇḍa*, 489 

> Compassion, forbearance, absence of envy, cleanliness, ease, good conduct. Absence of miserliness, absence of covetousness, these are common to all. 

*Bṛhaspatismṛti* defines *anāyāsa* as follows: 

> *śarīraṃ pīḍyate yena  
suśubhenāpi karmaṇā* |  
*atyantaṃ tan na kurvīta  
anāyāsaḥ sa ucyate* || 

- *Bṛhaspatismṛti*, *Saṃskārakāṇḍa*, 496 

That action which, even though is very auspicious, causes pain to the body, one should not perform it at all, this is called ' *anāyāsa*'. 

*1*

> *yadārambhe bhavet pīḍā  
> nityam atyantam ātmanaḥ* |  
> *tad varjayed dharmyam api  
> so'nāyāsaḥ prakīrtitaḥ* || 

- *Bṛhaspatismṛti*, *Saṃskārakāṇḍa*, 497 

That action, even if it be related to dharma, due to the performance of which, one definitely experiences a lot of pain, one should abstain from such action, thus is ' *anāyāsa*' declared. 

What is being said is this; if while performing a very auspicious or *dhārmika* action, one experiences pain, one should not perform such an action. This seems to provide a general direction to what kind of dharmas one should perform while he or she is in a certain kind of a situation. 

In the *Gautamadharmasūtra*, *anāyāsa* finds its place in a list of eight *ātmaguṇas* \(inner qualities\). These eight *ātmaguṇas* are so important, that without having these, even if one performs the fourty *saṃskāras* \(rituals\), one fails to attain *mokṣa* \(liberation\). 

> *athāṣṭāv ātmaguṇāḥ*||  
> *dayā sarvabhūteṣu, kṣāntir, anasūyā, śaucam, anāyāso, maṅgalam akārpaṇyam, aspṛheti*||  
> *yasyaite catvāriṃśat saṃskārā  
> na cāṣṭāv ātmaguṇā na sa brahmaṇaḥ *  
> *sāyujyaṃ sālokyaṃ ca gacchati*||  
> *yasya tu khalu saṃskārāṇām ekadeśo'py, aṣṭāv ātmaguṇā*,  
*atha sa brahmaṇaḥ sāyujyaṃ sālokyaṃ ca gacchati*||  
> - *Gautamadharmasūtra*, 1.8.23-26 

> Now eight inner qualities. Compassion for all beings, forbearance, absence of envy, cleanliness, ease, good conduct, absence of miserliness, lack of covetousness. The one who possesses these ~~fourty~~ *saṃskāras*, but not the eight inner qualities, does not attain the abode of *Brahman* and unity with *Brahman*. The one who possesses only some of the *saṃskāras*, but possesses the eight inner qualities instead attains the abode of *Brahman* and unity with *Brahman*. 

Not just in the *Dharmaśāstra*-texts, even in some of the *Purāṇas*, *anāyāsa* finds a mention along with other qualities enlisted as *sāmānya* dharmas. For example: 

> *ṛtukālābhigamanaṃ  
> svadāreṣu praśasyate*| 
*sarvvaloka-hitaiṣitvaṃ  
> maṅgalaṃ priyavāditā*||  
*anāyāso mahotsāhas  
> titikṣānabhimānitā*|  
*sāmānyaṃ sarvva-varṇānāṃ  
> munibhiḥ parikīrttitam*|| 

- *Bṛhannāradīyapurāṇa*, 22.27-28 

> Intercourse with one's own wife  
> during her season is praised. 
Desiring the benefit of all beings, good conduct, speaking agreeable speech.  
Ease, perseverance, forbearance, absence of pride.  
These are common to all *varṇas*, as declared by *Munis*. 

*2*

> *bhṛtyādi-bharaṇārthāya  
sarveṣāñ ca parigrahaḥ*| 
*ṛtukāle'bhigamanaṃ  
sva-dāreṣu mahīpate*||   
*dayā samastabhūteṣu  
> titikṣānabhimānitā*|  
*satyaṃ śaucam anāyāso  
> maṅgalyaṃ priyavāditā*||  
*maitraspṛhā \(maitry aspṛhā?\) tathā tadvad  
> akārpaṇyaṃ nareśvara*| 
*anasūyā ca sāmānyā  
> varṇānāṃ kathitā guṇāḥ*|| 

- *Viṣṇupurāṇa*, 3.8.35-37 

> O King\! \(common dharmas\) of all \(are\) arranging resources for maintaining the dependents and so forth.  
> Having intercourse with one's own wife during her season.  
Compassion for all beings, forbearance, absence of pride.  
Truth, cleanliness, ease, good conduct, speaking agreeable speech.  
Friendship, absence of covetousness, absence of miserliness.  
Absence of envy, these are the qualities common to all *varṇas*. 

In his commentary on *Parāśarasmṛti*, a *Dharmaśāstra*-text for the *Kaliyuga*, Mādhavācārya says: 

> *ataḥ kalau prāṇināṃ  
> prayāsa-sādhye dharme pravṛtty-a-sambhavāt  
> sukaro dharmo'tra bubhutsitaḥ*|  
> *sa ca dvividhaḥ -  
> caturṇāṃ varṇānāṃ sādhāraṇo'sādhāraṇaś ca*|  
> *tatra sādhāraṇo bṛhaspatinā nirūpitaḥ*- 
>
> *dayā kṣamā'nasūyā ca  
śaucānāyāsamaṅgalam*| 
*akārpaṇyāspṛhatve ca  
sarvasādhāraṇe ime*|| 

- *Parāśaramādhavīya*, 1.16½-17½ 

> "Hence, in the *Kaliyuga*, due to the impossibility of inclination in beings toward the dharma which requires effort,  
> the dharma which is easy to perform has been asked about here.  
> And it is of two types, of the four *varṇas*, common and uncommon.  
> The common has been stated by *Bṛhaspati*: 
> 
> Compassion, forbearance, absence of envy, cleanliness, ease, good conduct, absence of miserliness, absence of covetousness, these are common to all." 

## Places
In his commentary on *Manusmṛti* 2.24, where certain places have been suggested for the twice-borns to reside in, Medhātithi \(~10th century CE\) says: 

> *sa tu nitya-kāmyānām  
> ukta-rītyā etad-deśa evānuṣṭhāna-sambhavād  
> adhikṛtānāṃ prāpta eva*| 
> 
> *na hy etad-deśa-vyatirekeṇa kṛtsna-dharmānuṣṭhāna-sambhavaḥ*|  
> *tathāhi*|  
> *himavati tāvat kāśmīrādau śītenārditā  
> na bahiḥ sandhyopāsane'dhikriyante*|  
> *na ca yathāvidhi svādhyāya-sambhavaḥ  
> "prāg vodag vā grāmād upaniṣkramyeti"*|  
> *na hi hemanta-śiśirayor ahar ahar nadī-snānādi-sambhavaḥ*| 

- Medhātithi \( *Manusmṛti* 2.24\) 

*3*

> "The possibility of the residence in question exists  
> because it is only in the said places that the performance of the compulsory and optional rites is possible.  
> Apart from the said places, the performance Dharma in its entirety, is not possible.  
> For instance, in the snowy places, such as Kāśmīra, suffering from cold,  
> people are unable to perform *sandhyā*-worship outside;  
> nor is it possible to study the Veda in the proper manner, going out either to the east or to the north of the village;  
> nor is it possible to bathe in the river daily during the seasons of *hemanta* and *śiśira*." 

Similar direction is found in the *Bodhāyanadharmasūtra* \(2.3.51\) and Govindasvāmin's commentary on it: 

> *prabhūtaidhodaka-yava-sasamit-kuśa-mālyopaniṣkramaṇam āḍhyajanākulam*  
*analasa-samṛddham ārya-jana-bhūyiṣṭham a-dasyu-praveśyaṃ grāmam āvasituṃ yateta dhārmikaḥ*|| 

- *Bodhāyanadharmasūtra* 2.3.51 

> A *dhārmika* person should strive to reside in a village  
> which cannot be attacked by thieves,  
> and which has an abundance of fuel, water, fodder, *samit*-wood, *kuśā*-grass, flowers and pasturage,  
> where there are many rich people, many active people  
> and many scholarly people. 

At the end of his commentary on this, Govindasvāmin says: 

> "*yatra hi dharmāśramā-virodhena  
> jīvanaṃ sukaraṃ bhavati  
> tatra dhārmiko nityaṃ*
> *nivased ity arthaḥ*||" 

> "Where, \(living\) a life unopposed to \(one's\) dharma and *āśrama* becomes easy to be effected, there should a *dhārmika* person always reside." 

Similar has been stated in *Gautamadharmasūtra* \(9.65 or 1.9.65\). 

*Manusmṛti* \(4.60-61\) also prohibits a person, desirous of performing his dharmas properly, from residing in a place where such people live, who do not follow their dharmas. Hence, one way to practise *anāyāsa* along with the *viśeṣa* dharmas is to reside in a place where *dhārmika* people reside in abundance.+++(5)+++ 

It seems that the *Dharmaśāstras* expect the due performance of dharmas only from those who reside in such places where such performance is possible with some degree of ease.+++(5)+++ 

## Inconvenience to tohers
Putting someone else in pain or inconvenience for the performance of a scripturally ordained action, also leads to undesirable consequences. 

This idea has been portrayed in the *Mahābhārata *\( *Vanaparvan*, chapter 207 onward\) through the story of a *Brāhmaṇa* named Kauśika, who left his old aged parents without getting their permission, for learning Vedas. His parents suffered a lot of inconvenience because of such an action of his, and hence Kauśika incurred *pāpa* \(unseen demerit\). 

*4*

Further, *Manusmṛti* 4.176 prohibits the performance of any scripturally ordained action which causes pain to others in general \( *lokasaṅkruṣṭa dharma*\). This also agrees with the principle of *anāyāsa* via *ahiṃsā*. This further connects with *dayā* or compassion, because the one who possesses compassion, will never put anyone else in discomfort for the sake of achieving his or her own goals. 

When one refrains from creating any discomfort for oneself and also for others, one is saved from many sorts of inconvenience. This further leads to a relatively stable state of mind. 

> *teṣu sarveṣu yathopadeśam avyagro vartamānaḥ  
> kṣemaṃ gacchati*|| 

- *Āpastambadharmasūtra* 2.9.21.2 

> Being undisturbed, dwelling in all those \( *āśramas*\) as per the teaching \(of the scripture\), \(he\) attains *mokṣa*. 

The absence of disturbance is a prerequisite for the performance of other rituals, in order to attain the best desired result. 

Similarly, *anāyāsa* \(along with other seven inner qualities\) is a prerequisite for the fourty *saṃskāras* to bear the desired fruit. Why is it so? 

> *vedās tyāgaś ca yajñāś ca  
> niyamāś ca tapāṃsi ca*|   
*na vipraduṣṭabhāvasya  
> siddhiṃ gacchanti karhicit*|| 

- *Manusmṛti* 2.97 

> Learning of Vedas, giving away something as *dāna*, following *niyamas*, and performing *tapas'* \(austerities\), none of these bear the ultimate fruit if the performer \(of these\) has a wandering mind. 

The wandering of mind could be caused by both physical and mental disturbances. So as to prevent oneself from effecting a wasteful effort, it is implied that one should first work on the *sāmānya* dharmas such as *anāyāsa* and so forth. What the *Bṛhaspatismṛti* means when it talks about pain in the body \( *śarīra*\), is the pain in not just the physical body, but also one's mental and emotional pain. 

This is because in the traditional view, body consists of the gross physical body, the sense organs, mind and intellect. Hence the application of *anāyāsa* is not just on the physical body, but also on mind and intellect. If by the thought of or by the performance of a scripturally ordained activity, one's mind gets burdened, making the person very uncomfortable, should the person go on and perform the said activity? If he or she performs it, it would be a violation of *anāyāsa*. This further implies that the scripturally ordained *viśeṣa* dharmas are to be performed only in the absence of such physical and mental burdens. 

The emphasis on *anāyāsa* does not imply that one should not aspire to progress further with regards to fulfilling one's duties as ordained by the scriptures. What is intended is that such a performance of those duties should not lead to discomfort or pain, be it physical or mental, either to oneself or to another person. 

The negative nature of the term ' *anāyāsa*' should be kept in mind, that is, it is a negation of '*āyāsa*' or effort. 

*5*
## titikṣā
In some of the verses cited above, *titikṣā* or tolerance and *mahotsāha* or perseverance also find mention along with *anāyāsa*. The term ' *mahotsāha*' appears as an adjective in *Amarakośa *\(3.1.3\), where the commentator Kṛṣṇamitra says that a ' *mahotsāha*' person is the one who is eager to accomplish a task which is very difficult to be accomplished \( *dussādhye'pi tatparaḥ*\). Another commentator Bhānuji Dīkṣita says similar \( *duḥsādhyakṛtye'pi sādhanaparasya*\). *Kṣānti* has been mentioned in the *Gautamadharmasūtra *\(as cited above\) along with an *anāyāsa*. To state its meaning, the commentator Haradatta cites a verse as follows: 

> *ākruṣṭo'bhihato vā'pi  
> na krośen na ca tāḍayet*|  
> *aduṣṭo vāṅ-manaḥ-kāyaiḥ  
> sā titikṣā kṣamā smṛtā*|| 

> \(Even when\) one is verbally or physically hurt, \(one\) does not verbally or physically retaliate, \(and remains\) flawless in speech, mind and body, such tolerance is remembered as *kṣamā*. 

In the *Amarakośa* \(1.7.25\), *titikṣā* and *kṣānti* are mentioned as synonyms \( *kṣāntis titikṣā*\). So, when mentioned along with *anāyāsa*, *mahotsāha* could imply that one has taken up a task voluntarily and gladly, which is, in the eyes of others, very difficult to be accomplished. *Titikṣā* does not simply stand for tolerating pain with regards to a task, but primarily stands for the absence of retaliation, and in a sense falls within the *sāmānya* dharma called *ahiṃsā*. 

In conclusion, it can be said that our *Dharmaśāstras* do not intend to put us into very uncomfortable situations. They want us to perform our own dharmas with ease. Such ease is not possible everywhere, which is why even *Dharmaśāstras* suggest that one should move to a place where practising his or her dharmas with ease is possible. It could be said that the *Dharmaśāstras* primarily expect from those, who can practise their dharmas with ease, that they should practise them without fail. Others, who are not so fortunate, should practise as much as possible. The dharma, quality or principle of ' *anāyāsa*' certainly guides us in these matters, and tells us that we should not force ourselves to successfully perform a scripturally ordained action. 

Hence, dharma is not necessarily meant to be difficult to perform. Those who are unfortunately unable to perform their *viśeṣa* dharmas, should nevertheless try their best to perform the *sāmānya* dharmas as declared in the *Dharmaśāstras*.

<details><summary>विश्वास-टिप्पनी</summary>

Obv. dharma requires sacrifice, punishment and tolerance of adversity in many cases.

Yes, the orders of the Gods should be fulfilled with joy and enthusiasm - mixed with duHkha. So, there is a mental component to anAyAsa which seems ignored here.

Also ignored - it can involve suffering to others. (classic eg. sItA parityAga, dharma-yuddha)
