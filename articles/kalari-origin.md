title = "Kalari origin"
+++

Tulu Nadu is considered as birthplace of Kalaripayattu. The highest form of Kalari Vidya said to have existed there. Many Nair and Brahmin practitioners of Tulu Nadan Kalari were imported into Kerala by the rulers to train their troops.

The four Nair families of Valluvanad which supplied Chavers (suicide fighters) to Valluvanad Raja in Mamankam trace their origins to Tulu Nadu and were experts in Tulu Nadan Kalari Vidya.

Quite interestingly the Dharmoth Panickers who were the commanders of the Nair forces of the Samuthiris of Calicut also have their origin in Tulu Nadu. It seems many important Nair families like them share Tulu origin.
