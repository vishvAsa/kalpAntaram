II. The Daily Duties of Women 

(strīṇām āhnikam; Sdhp. 2v. 5-21r.3) 

'Now the daily duties of women are examined.'1 

The daily practice of the orthodox Hindu householder (male) is an important topic of dharmasastra, described in detail in numerous smṛtis, purāṇas and digests (e.g. Gaut.I.5, 1.9; Āp.II.1.1-II.4.9; Yājñ.1.96–127; Mārk.P.29-30,34; Kūrm.P.II.18-19; Sm.C.I.p.88232; Sm.A. p.18-48; etc.). For of all the asramas-Vedic student (brahmacarya), householder (gṛhastha), forest hermit (vānaprastha), and renouncer or ascetic (samnyāsin, yati, etc.)-that of householder is repeatedly described as the best. 

The asrama theory, examined in detail by Olivelle (1974; 1978; 1984), involves a gradual progression through three main stages of development. In the first, only the householder state receives wholehearted recommendation. The second encourages the notion of a choice between four separate and permanent states (vikalpa, 'alternative'). The third regards the four asramas as a continuous series of temporary states (samuccaya, ‘together'; i.e. in sequence in one lifetime). In all three versions of the theory, however, the householder state is held to be the best. 

The earliest exposition of the aśrama theory is presented by Gautama and Baudhāyana. (For an analysis of the corrupt text into 'Proto-' and 'Deutero-Baudhāyana', see Olivelle 1984.) Gautama notes the idea of a choice in the form of a purvapakṣa (āśramavikalpam; Gaut.I 3.1-2), without approval. For, in Gautama's view, the householder is quite literally the source (yoni) of the other three: only he produces children (aprajanatvād itareṣām, Gaut. 1.3.3; cf. Ragh. on Manu VI.87; Baudh.II.6.11.27). Moreover, the order of householder is the one explicitly enjoined (pratyaksavidhānād; Gaut.I.4.35) in all the Vedas, dharmaśāstras, itihāsas and purānas (Har. on Gaut.I.4.35). Baudhāyana even denies that there is a choice. The notion of four alternative paths is dismissed as a misunderstanding (Baudh.II.6.11.9) or the invention of a demon (Baudh.II.6.11.28). Baudhāyana stresses the importance of family

life; the payment of the three debts (to the seers by study, to the gods by sacrifice, to the ancestors by sons); and thus the urgent need to produce children (Baudh.II.6.11.33-4). 

The next stage in the development of the aśrama theory is shown in the views of Āpastamba and Vasistha. The four orders are now seen to be equally valid in the sense that one may attain liberation through any one of them (Āp.II.9.21.1-2), but they are still mutually exclusive and permanent. (It is important to distinguish here between studentship as a temporary first stage and perpetual studentship as a permanent state of celibacy; cf. Olivelle 1984:85.) Nonetheless, Āpastamba devotes a large number of sutras to proving that the householder state is superior to any of the celibate alternatives (Āp.II.9.23.3 ff.). 

The third stage may be found in Manu, Yajnavalkya and the later smrtis. The āśramas are now no longer alternative states but successive stages, each leading to the next in a steady progression towards liberation (Manu IV.1, VI.33). But still the householder. stage is best (Manu III.77–8, VI.89–90). This remarkably persistent eulogy of the householder underlines the fact that all dharmaśāstrins are, of course, householders themselves. 

In order to fulfil his significant part in the scheme of things, the householder must observe a clearly defined timetable of ritual and quasi-ritual activities, all included under the general heading of gṛhasthadharma, the ordained rites and duties of the householder. 

The day is sometimes divided into two (pūrvāhṇa, 'before noon', and aparāhna, 'afternoon'); or three (prātaḥsavana, morning', mādhyandinasavana, ‘midday', and tṛtīyasavana, ‘evening', corresponding to the three pressings of soma); or five (prātaḥ or udaya, 'dawn', samgava, ‘morning', i.e. when the cows are collected for milking, mādhyandina or madhyāhna, ‘midday', aparāhṇa, ‘afternoon', and sayam, sāyāhna or astagamana, ‘evening'). Most commonly, however, the division is into four parts (pūrvāhṇa, madhyāhna, aparāhṇa, sāyāhna), further subdivided into eight: that is, sixteen divisions covering the twenty-four hours of day and night (e.g. Dakṣa II.4-5; K aut.I.19; Katy. quoted by Apar. on Yajñ.II.1; and even Vidyārṇava's twentieth-century presentation of the āhnika rules, 1979:1). The normal unit of calculation is thus one and a half hours. 

With regard to the different varnas, no specific āhnika rules are laid down for the vaisya or sudra. These men would presumably 

[[46]]

adjust the āhnika rules prescribed for brahmin householders to suit themselves. The āhnika rules for a king are given in detail in Kaut.I.19 (cf. also Manu VII. 145–7, 151–4, 216–26; Yājā.I.327– 33). In the first part of the day (6.00–7.30 a.m.), the king should attend to matters of defence, income and expenditure; in the second (7.30-9.00 a.m.), he should consider the affairs of the people; in the third (9.00-10.30 a.m.), he should bathe, eat and study the Veda; in the fourth (10.30-12.00 noon), he should receive revenue and assign tasks; in the fifth (12.00–1.30 p.m.), he should consult his ministers and consider the secret information brought by spies; in the sixth (1.30-3.00 p.m.), he may amuse himself; in the seventh (3.00–4.30 p.m.), he should review his army; in the eighth (4.30– 6.00 p.m.), he should confer with his commander-in-chief. At the end of the day, he should perform the evening samdhyā (V.9–17). In the first part of the night (6.00–7.30 p.m.), he should consult his secret agents; in the second (7.30-9.00 p.m.), he should bathe, eat and study; in the third (9.00-10.30 p.m.), he should enter his bedchamber; in the fourth and fifth (10.30 p.m.-1.30 a.m.), he should sleep; in the sixth (1.30–3.00 a.m.), he should wake and contemplate the sastra (i.e. of politics) and the duties of the coming day; in the seventh (3.00-4.30 a.m.), he should meet with his councillors and send out secret agents; and in the eighth (4.30–6.00 a.m.), he should receive blessings from his priests, see his doctor, chief cook and astrologer, perform the appropriate rituals, and go to court (v.18-24). Alternatively, as Kautilya adds (thereby undermining the entire system), the king may divide his days and nights as he needs (v.25). 

Although Tryambaka probably intended his treatise for the edification of the women at court (who were presumably of largely kṣatriya families), the āhnika rules it prescribes for women have little in common with the rulings given above for their king. It is thus more appropriate to compare Tryambaka's rulings for women with those prescribed for brahmin householders. 

Daksa, for example, also divides the day into eight parts (II.4-5). For practical purposes, the day's timetable begins in the last division of the night (i.e. 4.30–6.00 a.m.) when a man should wake, perform the necessary ablutions and the acamana ritual, clean his teeth, bathe, and observe the twilight rituals (samdhyā). In the first division of the day (6.00-7.30 a.m.), he should worship his special deity and pay homage to his teacher. In the second (7.30-9.00 a.m.), he should study the Veda. In the third (9.00-10.30 a.m.), he should work for the maintenance of his family, following only 

 

[[47]]

those professions permitted to his varna. In the fourth (10.30-12.00 noon), he should bathe and perform the midday samdhyā. In the fifth (12.00-1.30 p.m.), he should perform the five great sacrifices (pañca mahāyajñāḥ): to brahman (brahmayajña, by the study or recitation of the Veda), to the gods (devayajña, by ritual offerings into the fire), to the ancestors (pitṛyajña, by the ritual of tarpana), to all beings (bhūtayajña, by bali offerings), and to men (manusyayajña, by offering hospitality to guests). These five observances absolve the householder of the five types of sin committed every day in the home (cf. Manu III.68-71; Vis.Sm.59.19-20 etc.). In the fifth part of the day, the householder should also take his main (midday) meal. In the sixth and seventh (1.30-4.30 p.m.), he should study secular literature (epics, purāna and so on). In the eighth (4.30–6.00 p.m.), he may receive or visit friends and perform the evening samdhyā rituals. From 6.00 p.m. until 9.00 p.m., he should attend to the duties omitted during the day and spend time with his family. From 9.00 p.m. until 4.30 a.m., he may take rest (Dakṣa II; Vidyārṇava 1979:1-2). 

Let us compare these typical basic divisions with the daily timetable prescribed for women by Tryambaka. The first point to notice is that Tryambaka divides the night (and presumably the day as well) into six parts instead of the usual eight (Sdhp.2v.8). This ruling is not specific to women, for the quotation cited is addressed to the householder 'together with his wife' (patnya saha). For Tryambaka then, the unit of calculation is two hours instead of one and a half. However, since Tryambaka rarely specifies the exact times or periods during which a particular duty should be performed, Figure 6 contains a rough timetable demonstrating the parallels between a woman's day as he describes it and that of a (brahmin) man as described in smṛti literature in general. 

A large proportion of the āhnika rulings cover activities to be carried out in the last division of night. In addition to most of the duties prescribed for men, a woman must also prepare the day's quota of rice or millet, sweep the house and smear it with cow-dung, perform the ritual of threshold worship, and attend to the cows. When her husband performs the morning fire sacrifice, she assists him. At dawn, she makes an offering to the sun. In the morning, while her husband studies the Veda and works at his profession, she attends to her household duties. At midday, when he performs the five great sacrifices, she assists him. When he eats, she serves him, eating what he leaves. After the meal, while he studies the

epics and purānas, she clears away the meal, washes, sweeps and cleans. In the evening, while he is visiting friends, she is still doing housework, for the food for the evening meal must be prepared afresh. At the evening sacrifice, she assists him again. Her final āhnika duties concern going to bed and sexual intercourse. Several of these duties are beautifully illustrated in two palm-leaf manuscripts in the British Library collection: milking the cows, cooking, serving food to her husband, tending her children, nursing an infant, massaging her husband's feet as he lies in bed, eating the

remains of his meal, and a variety of postures for sexual intercourse (British Library: OR. 11689, OR. 11612; see plates 1-13; cf. Lostly 1980: 14-45; cf. Gaur 1980:23-5). The paintings depicting children and the wife's involvement with them (e.g. plates 10, 11) draw our attention to a curious omission in the Strī-dharma-paddhati: while Tryambaka assumes that the good wife will produce sons, he not only shows no further interest in them, but makes no allowance for them in her day. 

Tryambaka also specifies no time when a woman may simply rest. Indeed, he lists 'sleeping in the daytime' among the six things that corrupt women and which they should therefore avoid (see section IV, p. 275, note 6). Since it is assumed that a woman has no education, it is less surprising that she is not advised to study. Judging by Tryambaka's prohibitions on 'roaming around' and spending time in other people's homes (section IV, p. 275, note 6), we would not expect her to be allowed to visit friends, certainly not on her own. Taken at face value, then, a woman should always be busy about her work. The traditional pattern of an Indian day, however, suggests that the hot period after the midday meal might well be given to rest. It is at this time that women might be encouraged to listen to readings from the epics or purāņas, or even from a work such as the Strī-dharma-paddhati (Introduction, pp. 22– 3 and 232-3). 

Before embarking on a discussion of each ruling, it may be instructive to consider at the outset what types of rulings these may be. The crucial question is how each ruling relates to its equivalent for men. The answer takes the form of four quite distinct categories. 

First, there are those rulings which, according to Tryambaka, are exactly the same for women as for men. These include the rulings concerning what one may or may not see first thing in the morning (darśaniyāny adarśaniyāni ca; section IIA, pp.54-7), urinating and defecating (mutrapurīṣotsargaḥ, section IIA, pp. 69–71), and cleaning the teeth (dantadhāvanam; section IIA, pp.78–82). This group of rulings clearly requires the operation of the uha of gender (see section I, pp. 40–3). 

Secondly, there are those rulings which are the same in principle for women as for men, but different in detail. For example, the rules on purification (saucam) are applicable to men and women except that for women the colour of the earth used and the number of lumps required is different (section IIA, pp. 71–2). The rules 

 

[[50]]

concerning sipping (acamanam) and bathing (snanam) also fall into this category. When a twice-born man sips, the water must touch his heart, throat or palate; when a woman sips, it need only touch her mouth (section IIA, pp. 75-7). A man performs his ritual bath with mantras, a woman without (section IIA, p. 83). Generally speaking, however, both rituals are applicable to women as well as men. Similarly, both men and women must wake early, but the wife should wake before her husband (section IIA, p. 52). Both must eat but the wife should serve her husband and eat only what he leaves (section IIC, pp. 221-7). This is a large group of rulings and the implications are interesting. I shall deal with each in its place. 

The third category, a very important one, consists of those rulings in which the wife assists her husband in his ritual obligations (pativratabhāginī). In the early morning meditation (devatādhyānam), for example, the man must meditate 'with his wife' (section IIA, pp. 52-4). In the fire sacrifice (agniśuśruṣā), although the wife has little to do, she must be present for the ritual to bear fruit (section IIB, pp. 132-41). In the ceremony of paying homage and hospitality to guests (atithipūjā), the wife must prepare the food and serve the guest on her husband's behalf (section IIC, pp. 21014). These rulings indicate the role and status of the wife in the joint ritual duties enjoined upon the married couple. I shall deal with this in some detail in the section on serving the sacred fire (agniśuśrūṣā) (section IIB, pp. 107–15). 

Finally, there are the duties peculiar to women. These are predominantly rulings concerning housework, such as grinding grain (section IIA, pp. 58-9), cleaning the house (p. 59), smearing it with cow-dung (pp. 59–63), clearing away after the meal (section IIC, pp. 229–33), and so on. As is clear from the parallel timetable, these duties are to be performed when the husband is studying religious literature or working for the family maintenance. They are thus both part of a woman's religious path and her contribution to the family. The parallel with the man's religious duties becomes more apparent in the context of Manu's dictum on marriage for women: a wife serving her husband is like a student serving his teacher; and her household duties are equivalent to her husband's performance of the fire sacrifice (Manu II.67; see section I, p. 35, note 16). Looked at from this point of view, household tasks become part of the powerful vrata or religious observance of the wife. Hence the high tone in which these apparently mundane tasks are described.
