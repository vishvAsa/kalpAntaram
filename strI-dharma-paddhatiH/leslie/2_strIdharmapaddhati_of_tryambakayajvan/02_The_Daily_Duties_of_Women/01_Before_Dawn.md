IIA Before Dawn 

(Sdhp. 2v.5-7v.9) 

I shall begin by taking, out of sequence, the rulings relating to the time of waking (prabodhanam; Sdhp.2v.5-3r.3). As Tryambaka explains, 'both householder and wife should already be awake (i.e. have risen) in the final or sixth division of the night (4.00-6.00 a.m.).'1 ‘According to the Smṛtiratnāvalī, it is wrong to be asleep (or in bed) after the brahmamuhūrta: if a married couple stays in bed in the brahmamuhurta, their house is like a cremation ground, shunned by the (spirits of) the ancestors.'

Although definitions of brahmamuhurta differ, the general ruling is constant in smrti literature. Rising before dawn is prescribed for everyone from the Vedic student to the householder (e.g. Manu IV.92; Yājñ.I.115; Gaut.XXIII.21). Kulluka on Manu IV.92 defines brāhmamuhurta as an unspecific pre-dawn period (kālamātravacanaḥ), so called because of its association with Brahmi, the goddess Bhāratī—a false identification as is evidenced by the alternative name 'the hour of Prajapati' (prājāpatye muhurte; e.g. Vas.XII.47)—and because it is the time devoted to Vedic recitation. Sm.C.II.p.234 quotes a verse attributed to Pitāmahaḥ defining brāhmamuhūrta as the last division of the night (rātreḥ paścimo yamaḥ; i.e. 4.30-6.00 a.m.). Par.M.I.i. pp. 219-20 quotes both Manu IV.92 and Yājñ.I.115 cited above, as well as equivalent passages from the Kurmaand Visnupurānas, and defines brahmamuhūrta as the first of the two muhurtas that make up the ardhaprahara or one and a half hour period before dawn (i.e. 4.305.15a.m.) According to Śrīdharasvamin's commentary on the Visnupurana, it is the third muhurta before sunrise (suryodayat pūrvam tṛtīye muhūrte; III.ii.5), i.e. two hours before dawn. 

A cycle of legends referred to in the Brahmanas explains why one should rise before dawn. According to the Maitrāyaṇīsamhitā (IV.1.9), the gods sought a scapegoat on whom they might 'wipe 

[^1]: sodhaḥ vibhajya rajanim caramāmse prabodhitaḥ patnya saha...il Sdhp.2v.8. Cf. note 6.

off the guilt of the blood-sacrifice. Agni spat upon the waters: Ekata, Dvita and Trita were born. The gods unloaded their guilt on them, and they in turn unloaded it onto whoever was still asleep when the sun rose. This was the beginning of a chain in which each individual, by virtue of his own sin, receives this new sin and then passes it on to another even more sinful individual. According to the Maitrāyaṇīsamhita, the buck stops at the foetus-killer; according to the Taittiriyabrāhmaṇa (III.2.8.9 ff.), at the brahmin-murderer. All the individuals mentioned in the various lists, including the person who is still asleep at dawn, are evidently regarded as being already sinful and thus the appropriate recipients of the guilt or sin of others (cf. Bloomfield 1964(1):521 ff.). 

Secondly (Tryambaka in fact makes this point first), 'a woman should rise before her husband does.'3 A verse Tryambaka attributes to Yajnavalkya explains that ‘a woman who lies down after her husband and wakes before him, and who desires no one else in her mind, is held to be a devoted wife (pativratā).'4 This means that, according to the sixfold division of night, a man is required to rise at 4 a.m. and his wife earlier still. 

This attribute of the devoted wife is much praised in epic literature. For example, Yudhisthira's eulogy of Draupadi when he stakes her in the dice game includes in the list of her perfections the fact that she is always the last in the household to go to bed and the first to wake (Mbh.II.58.35a). Draupadi says much the same thing herself in her far longer lecture to Satyabhāmā on the proper behaviour of wives (Mbh.III.222.23, 36; see section IV, pp. 280–1). Although it seems at first sight to be a minor point, this ruling in fact combines two important requirements of strīdharma: the reverence a wife should show her husband; and her selfless preoccupation with household tasks. 

Thirdly, as soon as she is awake, she should meditate on the (chosen) deity.'5 The rulings on meditation (devaṭādhyānam)

are in principle applicable to both men and women and are described elsewhere in various ways. In fact, the term 'meditation' with all its complex (and modern) associations is somewhat misleading here. It probably means no more than recalling to mind an image of a particular deity, perhaps using the dhyāna verse of a familiar stotra that is specifically designed to aid the worshipper in creating this mental image (cf. Bühnemann 1983:24, 26, 30). 

The Smrticandrikā (II.p.234, quoting Kurm.P.II.18.3) rules that one should meditate on (one's chosen) god; or alternatively (quoting Manu IV.92), that one should meditate on 'the true meaning of the Veda' (vedatattvārtham), glossed as 'the supreme Self' (paramātmā). One would expect Tryambaka to reject both these alternatives when applied to women: the former because (according to his own rulings) the worship of deities is one of the six things that cause women to fall (section IV, p. 275, note 7); the latter, because she has no access to Vedic literature. Several digests prescribe the recitation of five verses from the Vāmanapurāṇa (Vām.P.14.23–7; cf. Vir.A.p.16; Sm.M.II.p.210). Some suggest verses naming individuals whose praise brings great merit (Nala, Yudhisthira, Sītā, Kṛṣṇa, etc.; cf. Sm.M.II.p.210). Others list those who have lived long (Aśvatthaman, Bali, Vyasa, Hanuman, etc.) or suggest the names of the five holy women (Ahalya, Draupadi, Sītā, Tārā, Mandodari; cf. PVK II.i.p.648). Tryambaka, however, ignores even the last particularly suitable suggestion and specifies merely that 'the husband together with his wife should meditate on Hari (Visnu), and then reflect on the requirements of dharma and artha for the coming day.'6 Presumably, meditating with one's husband on his chosen deity is allowed. Yet in his section on widowhood, Tryambaka explicitly states that the good wife may worship Visnu only if she thinks all the time of her husband and not of the god (section IV, p. 300, note 66). 

The latter part of the ruling is to be found in many smrtis and digests (e.g. Manu IV.92; Yājñ.I.115; Sm.C.II.p.234). It is a reference to the marriage ritual and recalls the vow made by the bridegroom that he will fulfil the requirements of dharma, artha and kāma only with his (chief, i.e. lawful) wife (cf. PVK II.i.533). (For a

[[54]]

modern version of this ritual in which the bride makes this vow, see Menski 1984:11,872.) The requirements of kama have presumably been met by sexual intercourse the night before. In the morning, after the appropriate meditation to purify their minds, they should together consider the religious duties (dharma) and business or worldly commitments (artha) of the coming day. According to the Visnupurana, one should contemplate all three together, as long as neither kāma nor artha conflict with dharma (III.11.5–7). It is frequently stressed that the trivarga, the triple goal of the householder, can only be met through the co-operation of the wife (e.g. Sm.C.III.ii.p.582); hence the wife is the root or basis of that goal (mūlam trivargasya, Mbh.1.68.40; cf. Yājn.I.74). 

This is another example of the third category of āhnika rulings, but one in which the earlier tone of joint participation of both wife and husband remains. It is this aspect of strīdharma that earns the good wife the epithet sadharmacāriṇī, 'she who fulfils dharma with (her husband)'. It is this same aspect of strīdharma that Yudhisthira finds so hard to comprehend in view of the dire pronouncements usually made concerning the wickedness of women. I shall consider Yudhisthira's problem in the section on the inherent nature of women (see section III, p. 268). I shall comment further on the nature of the wife's participation in her husband's ritual duties in the subsection on the fire sacrifice (see section IIB, pp. 107-15). 

The fourth proviso on getting up in the morning concerns 'what one may or may not see (darśaniyāny adarśanīyāni ca) on waking',7 that is, during that crucial first stage of the day. Tryambaka quotes two slokas from Katyayana. The work identified here is included in Jivananda's collection of smrtis, the Dharmasastrasamgraha, as the Karmapradipa of Katyāyana or the Katyayanasmṛti (Katy. Sm.). As the opening verse explains, it is based on the Gobhilagrhyasūtra and is intended as a further elucidation of certain topics covered there. The same work is given in the Anandāśrama collection of smṛtis, the Smṛtīnām Samuccayah, as Gobhilasmṛti (Gobh.Sm.). These particular two slokas, or versions of them, are frequently quoted in writings on āhnika. The Bṛhatsamhitā deals at length with other kinds of omens occurring at dawn, from the calls of 

[^7]: prabodhānantaram darsaniyāny adarśaniyāni ca darśayati kātyāyanaḥ // Sdhp.2.v.10-3r.1. 

 

Before Dawn 

[[55]]

birds and animals to the shapes and colours of the passing clouds (Br.Sam.30). 

The first sloka provides a list of auspicious sights. 'If, on rising early, one sees a learned brahmin, a fortunate man, a cow, fire, or a man who has performed the agnicayana ritual, then one is released from (all) difficulties.'8 For subhagam, ‘a fortunate man' (Sdhp.; Sm.M.; Par.M. preferred reading), there is the alternative reading subhagam, 'a fortunate woman' (i.e. one whose husband is alive; Gobh.Sm.; Kāty.Sm.; Par.M., 11 out of 13 MSS). A similar reference in Par.Sm.XII.47 concerning objects the sight of which is always auspicious modifies gām, 'cow', to kapilā (kapilavarṇā dhenuḥ; Par.M.II.ii.p.34), ‘a dark brown cow'. (In Mbh.XIII.76, Bhisma explains why the kapila cow is more sacred than any other.) Agnicitam may either be taken together with agnim to mean ‘an altar on which the fire sacrifice is made' (cf. PVK II.1.648); or it may, as I prefer, be taken separately to mean ‘a man who has performed the (śrauta ritual of) constructing the fire altar' (i.e. as described in the Satapathabrāhmaṇa). Par.Sm.XII.47 lists agnicit first among the objects the sight of which is always auspicious. The Parasaramādhavīya takes this to mean 'one who is auspicious (yuktaḥ; lit. "fit" or "suitable") by virtue of the fire altar he has created by piling up bricks (iṣṭakācayanasamskṛtenāgninā).’ 

The second sloka provides the complementary list of inauspicious sights. 'If, on rising early, one sees a very wicked man, an unfortunate man, an intoxicating drink, a naked man, or one who has had his nose cut off, that is a sign of misfortune.'9 There are a variety of alternative readings here. For durbhagam, an unfortunate man'

[[56]]

(Sdhp.; Sm.M.; Par.M.), there is durbhagām, 'an unfortunate woman' (i.e. a widow; Gobh.Sm.; Kāty.Sm.; see section IV, pp. 298–304). For madyam, ‘an intoxicating drink' (Sdhp.; Par.M., two MSS and the Calcutta edn.), there is martyam, 'a dead (lit. “mortal") man' (Sm.M.); antyam, ‘an inferior man' (i.e. an untouchable; Gobh. Sm.; Kāty.Sm.); and cāndham, a blind man (Par. M., preferred reading). 

Utkṛttanāsikam, ‘one whose nose has been cut off probably refers to the punishment of mutilation. This is noted in A.D. 19 by Strabo (McCrindle 1971:57). Hsüan-Tsang, in A.D. 630-44, records that the violator of filial duty had his nose, ears, hands and feet cut off in punishment. However, since this particular offence is normally accorded a fine in the lawbooks (e.g. Manu VIII.389; Kaut.III.20.18), perhaps Hsüan-Tsang's statement is an exaggeration intended as propaganda for his own people (Devahuti 1970: 4-5). Nonetheless, the nose is included among the ten parts of the body on which punishment may be inflicted in the case of offenders of the three lower castes (Manu VIII.124-5; Gaut.I.8.13). In the case of a woman convicted of adultery, Kautilya rules that if her husband is not ready to forgive her, she should have her nose and ears cut off, whereas her lover should be killed (IV.12.30-3). In epic literature, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa cut off Tataka's nose, ears and hands with undisguised relish before killing her (Rām.1.26.11, 17-18); and later Lakṣmaṇa cuts off the nose and ears of Ravana's sister as punishment for her improper suggestions to Rāma (Rām. III.18.21). In the context of war, the Mānasollāsa, written by King Someśvara in c. A.D. 1140, describes four means of subduing an enemy including the janangacchedaka type, according to which defeated warriors had their ears and noses cut off (Vol.I,2.20.1034, 39). Interestingly, in the Marathi expression nāk kāpane, the literal meaning ("to cut the nose') has been superseded by the metaphorical ('to defeat'; cf. Bühnemann 1983:73). Nonetheless, the loss of the nose seems to have occurred sufficiently often for its restoration by plastic surgery to have become the special practice and skill of the brickmaker caste. One such case is reported, and the operation described in detail, by British medical officers in India in 1794: the victim was a bullock-driver with the British army who, being made prisoner by Tippu Sultan, had his nose and one of his hands cut off (Urban 1794:891-2; plate I, facing p.883). 

Before Dawn 

[[57]]

Alternatively, utkṛttanāsika might refer to a deformed nose, or even to a tribal physiognomy considered unattractive to the highcaste Hindu. When Strabo writes of a people 'without noses, having only two orifices above the mouth, through which they breathe', or Ktêsias of a 'deformed' people with 'snub noses', McCrindle interprets these as exaggeratedly dismissive descriptions of Mongolian tribes regarded by the orthodox Hindu as of extremely low caste (1971:60–3). 'Noselessness' in this context might be no greater deformity than the receding chin of the so-called 'chinless wonder'. This possibility is reinforced by Varāhamihira's section on the auspicious and inauspicious marks of men (puruṣalakṣaṇam; Br.Sam.68.60-2). A conspicuous nose is deemed auspicious: a long one (dirgha), for example, brings good fortune; one like a parrot's beak (sukasamanāsa) brings happiness. A flat one (cipițanāsa), however, indicates that death will be caused by a woman; whereas one that looks as if it has been cut off (chinnānurūpa) indicates contact with forbidden women. Whether the nose described is mutilated, deformed, or merely especially flat, however, the sight of it first thing in the morning is inauspicious. 

There is one further point. These rulings on what should or should not be seen are among those couched grammatically in the masculine gender but deemed by Tryambaka to apply to women too (see section I). However, even if we accept the readings subhagam and durbhagām, most of the people listed are men and Tryambaka gives clear directions that women should as far as possible avoid all men other than their husbands (see section IIC, pp. 170–6). One might argue that the modification of gender should be invoked here too but that is not always possible: śrotriya (a brahmin learned in the Veda) and agnicit (one who has performed the śrauta ritual of constructing the fire altar), for example, must (according to Tryambaka's view on the religious role of women) apply exclusively to men. It seems that these verses have merely been lifted out of their original (male) context and reapplied rather less appropriately to women. Alternatively, perhaps the rulings in fact apply to men but are given here so that their wives may take appropriate action. For the knowledge of omens (nimittajñāna) is listed in the Kamasutra as one of the sixty-four arts a woman should master. Perhaps it is the wife's duty to ensure that the first thing her husband sees in the morning is auspicious. 

 

[[58]]

Household tasks (1) 

Tryambaka proceeds to list the household tasks that must be attended to before dawn (Sdhp.3r.3-4r.4). None of these items are included or even paralleled in the āhnika duties for men. It seems a practical necessity, therefore, that women should rise and get to work before their men. 

In the context of dharmasastra, we should note that rulings may be divided into three major types depending on whether or not the reasons for doing them are apparent. Those that are based on practical considerations relating to this world are said to have a 'visible' or 'seen' basis (dṛṣṭamūla). Bathing in the morning is an obvious example (see section IIA, p.82). Those for which no such this-worldly considerations are evident are held to have a more compelling 'invisible' or 'unseen' basis (adṛṣṭamūla), such as the acquisition of merit that will take effect only in the next life. The number of lumps of earth prescribed for the ritual purification of different varṇas seems to fit this category (section IIA, pp. 71–4). The third type combines both 'seen' and 'unseen' considerations (drstādrstamula). For example, one accepts the prasāda of a deity both because it is tasty (drstamula) and because it conveys merit (adrstamula). Many of the rulings concerning early morning housework may be seen to belong to the drsta classification. For it makes sense to do this kind of hard physical work when one is fresh rather than in the evening when one is tired. Similarly, in order to get the work done at all, a woman would have to rise extremely early. 

First, 'the grain and so on (required for the coming day) must be prepared in the last part of the night.' 10 Attributing his quotations to the Mārkandeyapurana, Tryambaka declares that 'all kinds of happiness and prosperity accrue to those women who in the last division of the night perform such tasks as preparing the grain.'11 Kishwar and Vanita (1984:3-4) stress the laborious and time-consuming nature of this work. Grains and pulses must be cleaned and sifted by hand to remove dirt, twigs and stones. Paddy

is boiled, dried, then husked by pounding. Wheat and corn are ground. Even spices are usually ground fresh before each meal. The sounds of this lengthy process of cleaning, grinding and pounding can be heard in the dark early hours of morning throughout village India. Sarah Hobson, for example, describes how the women in her household in Karnataka were always up by 4 a.m., grinding the millet for the family's consumption that day (1978:53). A generation ago, this was also common in urban areas where it is now often done by machine. 

Next, still 'in the early morning, the house must be thoroughly cleaned and so on.'12 Tryambaka continues to quote from the Mārkandeyapurana: 'If the sun's rays touch a house before it has been thoroughly cleaned, then the ancestors, the gods and the (divine) mothers will turn their faces away from him who owns it.'13 The house belongs to the husband; the penalty is seen to rest on him; but the responsibility for averting it lies with the wife alone. 

Once the cleaning is done, she should smear the floor and walls of the house with cow-dung (gomayenānulepanam). As in the villages and the poorer urban areas of India today, the houses were made primarily of mud. Then as now, the mud surface was smeared with cow-dung to give it the required smooth and absorbent matt finish. The coating was believed to purify the dwelling, in both the medical (drsta) and the ritual (adrṣta) sense. Hence, as the quotation attributed to the Mārkandeyapurana explains, 'every day early in the morning, the woman of the house should smear cow-dung throughout the home; once she has done so, she will meet with no difficulties at all.'14 In fact, this task involves a considerable amount of work. The dung must first be collected. It is then mixed with mud and straw to form a paste with which major and minor repairs, as well as the required surface finish, may be achieved; and all by hand (cf.Kishwar and Vanita 1984:4).

The sanctity of the cow in general is so basic an assumption in Hindu culture that it is rarely justified or explained. Reverence for the cow is enjoined by the lawbooks: being in a cow-pen is likened to being in the presence of brahmins or at the recitation of the Veda (Manu IV.58); polluting a cow to polluting a brahmin or fire (Manu IV.142); offending a cow to offending one's guru, one's parents, or brahmins (Manu IV.162). In the Mahābhārata, Bhisma regales Yudhisthira with eulogistic praise of cows: they are the mothers of the universe; there is no gift more sacred; there is nothing to equal them; with each part of their bodies they uphold the sacrifice; sacred in themselves, they can cleanse and sanctify others; and so on (Mbh.XIII.79.12–14; 80.2-3, 12). Even in a busy city street today, one may see a cyclist pause to touch a passing cow, then his own forehead, before pedalling on. Reverence for everything relating to cows is so great that pañcagavya, a mixture of cow's milk, curd, ghee, urine and dung, together with water in which blades of kusa grass have been placed, is deemed to purify many sins (e.g. section II.D, p. 244, note 24; Yājñ.III.263,314; Baudhāyanagṛhyaseṣasutra II.20.1 ff.; Par.Sm.XI.28-34; Manu 

XI.165). 

When enjoining women to coat their homes with cow-dung, however, Tryambaka evidently feels the need for some further explanation concerning the sanctity and purifying powers of dung. In fact, he anticipates precisely the kind of reaction that is expressed in the epic by Yudhisthira. The latter has heard it said that cow-dung is 'delighted in by Śrī, the goddess of prosperity' (śriyā juṣṭam), but he has his doubts (Mbh.XIII.81.1). Bhīṣma's response is to narrate the story of how the goddess came to dwell in the dung of cows (śrīgosamvadaḥ; Mbh.XIII.81). Tryambaka's digression in praise of cow-dung (gomayasya prāśastyam; Sdhp.3r. 7-3v.5) is extracted from this. 

Tryambaka's version runs briefly as follows. 'Assuming a beautiful form, Śri entered among the cows and said: "I wish to dwell in any one part of you, even in one that is (usually) despised. For nothing despicable can be seen in you, O sinless ones. O you whọ are both pure (in yourselves) and (capable of) purifying (others), O you fortunate ones, grant me a dwelling place! Please tell me where in your bodies I may dwell." The cows replied: "O glorious one, we must of necessity show honour to you. O beautiful one, dwell in our dung and urine for they are pure." Śrī replied: “By

[[61]]

good fortune, you have shown me this gracious favour. Let it be as you say and may all be well with you! O you who bestow happiness, I am honoured!" (Bhīṣma concludes to Yudhisthira:) “My son, the great glory of cow-dung has now been explained to you." 15 The conclusion comes from another chapter altogether: 'one should therefore not recoil in any way from either the dung or the urine of cows.'16 Tryambaka sums up in his own words. 'And thus it has been established by the experience of everyone that a place smeared with cow-dung is pure, the abode of Lakṣmi.'17 Tryambaka's greatly abbreviated story is clearly intended to encourage women to bring the goddess of prosperity into the house by smearing it with cow-dung. What he omits from the version told by Bhisma, however, is equally instructive. For when the cows first see the goddess, although they are impressed by her beauty, they do not know who she is (Mbh.XIII.81.4-5). She identifies herself as the one whose absence caused the defeat of the Daityas, whose presence bestows happiness on gods and rṣis, and without whom neither dharma, artha nor kāma brings happiness (v.6–8). But when she asks permission to reside in the cows, she is abruptly, even rudely, refused on the grounds that she is unstable (adhruvām) and fickle (cañcalām; v.10). Besides, they explain, their bodies are good enough already; they have no need of her (v.11). Śrī's first response is to bluster. She describes the lengths to which both gods and demons have gone in order to gain her favour; never in

the three worlds has she been so insulted (v.12-15). The cows demur: they did not mean to offend her; however, she is unstable and fickle, and for this reason alone they do not want her to be part of them; and there is no need to discuss the matter any further (v.16-17). Now Śrī is reduced to begging. If they cast her off like this, she will become an object of scorn in the world. They are always ready to grant protection to others, so why not to her? If they rescue her from her predicament, she will always be devoted to them. She is even willing to take up residence in the most despised part of their body, since no part of them can truly be considered despicable (v.18-20). Faced with such desperate pleas, the cows (described as 'naturally inclined to show compassion to those in distress'; karunavatsalāḥ) confer with one another (v.22). At last, they give in: she may dwell in their dung and urine (v.23). Śrī is overcome with gratitude (v.24). The whole tone of this passage and the balance of power implied is quite different from that suggested in Tryambaka's doctored version. 

It is obvious that 'fortune' is personified as a female quite simply because it is held to possess such 'female qualities' as fickleness and instability. As I explain in section III, these are two of the catchwords that describe the innate weaknesses of women. According to Manu VIII.77, women have by nature such unstable minds (strībuddher asthiratvāt) that even pure women are not permitted to serve as witnesses in court. (For some reason, the unreliability of the female mind does not debar women from giving evidence in court for other women; see Manu VIII.68.) 

It is equally obvious that identifying the goddess with defectridden human women cannot serve Tryambaka's purpose here. He needs the image of Śrī to be glorious and powerful for two reasons. First, he uses her presence in cow-dung to explain and glorify the custom of smearing the house with it and, by association, to ascribe that task to women. For example, it is one of the tasks included in Uma's discourse to Maheśvara on the proper behaviour of wives (Mbh.XIII.134.44; omitted in Tryambaka's extract in section IV, pp. 281-2). Secondly, Śrī must be a figure for women to emulate (e.g. Mbh.I.191.5-6). Thus the truly virtuous wife herself becomes the embodiment of Śrī in the home (e.g. Draupadi, Mbh.I.189.29,33; Sāvitrī, Mbh.III.277.25). Elsewhere, Śrī herself explains that she resides in those women who are devoted to truth, attend to their housework, always obey their husbands, and behave 

 

Before Dawn 

[[63]]

with the appropriate decorum (Mbh.XIII.11.10 ff.). Indeed, as Manu explains, there is no difference between virtuous child-bearing wives (striyaḥ) and goddesses of fortune (śriyaḥ) dwelling in the homes of men (IX.26). It is evidently counterproductive, then, to allow the cows to label Śrī with the same faults as ordinary women and to treat her in the same disparaging way. Quite reasonably, therefore, Tryambaka edits the passage to suit his own requirements. 

In the context of the Stridharmapaddhati, and Tryambaka's insistence that the good wife should worship no god other than her husband (e.g. section IV, p.274, note 2; p.281, note 21; p.282, note 24; p.300, notes 66, 67; etc.), it is instructive to ask what exceptions are allowed, and why. In fact, there are only two, and both concern goddesses: Śrī in this section; and her sister, Jyesthā, in section IIC (pp. 227-9). But neither goddess is being nominated to rival the husband. Clearly, Sri is not to be worshipped in the sense that Šiva or Visnu might be; she is to be emulated. For Tryambaka, she is simply the embodiment of the orthodox belief regarding the good wife. The negative associations he glosses over remain an unspecified but uneasy undercurrent in the complex world of strīdharma. (For the even more ambivalent image of Jyestha, see section IIC, pp. 227-9.) 

The link between the goddess and women is further reinforced in the next subsection. The worship of the threshold (dehalīpūjā) is yet another household task to be completed before dawn by the woman of the house. Tryambaka quotes a series of unattributed slokas. 'In the early morning in particular, the threshold is not to be left blank (i.e. of rangavalya; see note 22). If a woman leaves her threshold blank (sunya), her family also becomes a blank.'18 This is a reference to the auspicious designs sketched in white or coloured powders on and around the front entrance by the woman of the house. In villages today right across India, women can still be seen making these often very complex designs in the early hours of the morning. A family that is sunya is one without children. Since in the orthodox view a woman's primary function is to bear children (e.g. Manu IX.96), this is a dire threat indeed.

Tryambaka continues, the quotation. 'The goddess, deity of all, always resides on the threshold. She must therefore be worshipped there every day with the fragrance of sandalwood paste, flowers, unbroken grains and so on.'19 ‘Anyone who touches that threshold with his foot or crosses over it without worshipping it first will find no happiness; therefore one should take care not to do that.'20 'If a woman walks over ground that has been smeared (i.e. with cow-dung) but not marked with the auspicious sign of the svastika, she will lose three things: her wealth (vittam), long life and her good reputation.'21 The reference to a woman's wealth must presumably be understood in terms of the rules set forth by Tryambaka regarding the rights of women to own property (strīdhanam; see section IV, pp. 277-80). Ground that is smeared with cow-dung but unmarked by the svastika is traditionally held to be extremely inauspicious. It is the custom in Maharashtra, for example, that when a corpse has been lying on the ground, after it is finally removed, the area is smeared with cow-dung and deliberately left without the mark of the svastika. Ground treated in this way is thus automatically associated with someone's death (LSJ). Tryambaka concludes that 'the goddess Laksmī, complete with all her attributes, always dwells in the house that always shines as a result of smearing (with cow-dung) and auspicious powder designs (rangavalya).'22 

Tryambaka now adds the rider that 'this (i.e. all these items of housework)-cleaning (the house), smearing (the walls and floor with cow-dung), pounding (the grain) and so on—should be done as far as possible by (the wife) herself; alternatively, she may get someone else (such as a servant, daughter-in-law or even junior co-wife) to do them.'23 In support of this statement, Tryambaka

quotes from Sumana's advice to Sandilī on the correct behaviour of women (see also section IV, pp. 282-3). With regard to the wife's general domestic duties, Sumanā explains, rising early in the morning, I do or get someone else to do all the tasks that have arisen for the benefit of the household.'24 

But on no account may the wife delegate her sacrificial duties to anyone else. As Tryambaka declares, 'she should herself attend to serving the (sacred) fire and to preparing the implements required for the worship of the gods.' 25 In support of this statement, Tryambaka presents a quotation attributed to 'Skanda' (Sdhp.4r3-4) that is reproduced in his comments on devapujā (Sdhp. 12v.5-8, section IIC, pp. 178–80, and again in his section on general behaviour (Sdhp. 7–9, section IV, pp. 273–4.) I shall deal with it in the most appropriate of these three contexts, that of devapujā (section IIC, p. 179, note 35). It is enough to say here that the virtuous wife may delegate her domestic duties to servant or relative (cf. Sinha 1980:116-19), but never her ritual duties. 

At this point, Tryambaka moves on to the rules concerning personal hygiene (mūtrapurīṣotsargah; see below, pp. 69-71). Before describing these, however, I shall briefly consider the rulings given in the later subsection on the care and worship of cows (gosevanam; Sdhp.5v.9-6v.5; plate 1). These are also among the duties to be performed -before dawn but, in Tryambaka's schema, they are sandwiched rather oddly between teeth-cleaning (dantadhāvanam; see pp. 78-82) and bathing (snānam; pp. 82-8). I prefer to include them in this section on general household duties, together with the other points relating to cows and cow-dung. 

Without introduction or comment, Tryambaka quotes what are apparently two passages from the Mahabharata. In fact, both consist of slokas and half-slokas taken indiscriminately either from the Mahābhārata chapters on cows or from verses elsewhere attributed to the Mahābhārata. Most of the rulings are given in the masculine form, indicating general duties applicable to both men and women but here ascribed to women. Their inclusion in

this treatise is probably intended to reinforce still further the link between women, the goddess Śrī and cows. 

The first lengthy passage reads as follows. 'If one pays homage to cows morning and evening, one becomes prosperous. One should always praise cows, not treat them with contempt. One should not be hostile towards cows, even in the mind, but should always strive to make them happy. One should honour and worship them with gestures of respect (namaskārai[ḥ]). For cows are the mothers of all beings and they bring happiness to all. Those who seek success should always walk round cows, keeping them on their right (pradakṣināḥ; i.e. as a token of respect; cf. Manu IV.39 ; Gonda 1980:58-9). One should not kick cows (cf. A.V.XIII.1.56), nor walk through the midst of them. For they are gods in whom good fortune resides and so must always be honoured.'26 'Whether in the hot season, in the rains, or in the cold season, or in any windy or extreme conditions, one should not see to one's own safety without first seeing as far as possible to that of one's cows. One should not report a cow that is eating, whether it is doing so in one's own house, field or threshing floor, or in someone else's; nor should one report a calf that is sucking (cf. Manu IV.59; Āp.I. 31.10.18; Gaut.IX.23 etc.). (Calves are often tethered precisely to prevent them from drinking their mother's milk). If a cow has fallen or become stuck in the mud, one should use all one's strength to raise it up.'27 'Confining and tethering cows for their own protec

tion, however, is no sin: (if the cow is harmed in the process), whether intentionally or unintentionally, this is not to be treated as (the punishable offence of) harming it (tadvadham); and one should tether the animal with (ropes made from) kāśa and kuśa grass so that it faces south. But if one drives a cow into a well or a pond, or makes it trip up on logs (or tree stumps), or if one sells it to people who eat cows, then one incurs (the sin of) harming a cow (govadham). Moreover, there is no prāyaścitta (rite of expiation; i.e. powerful enough to atone) for cows that are killed in a well or ditch, or in a pit with reinforced sides, or in a dammed up river, or in a roadside tank, or in (any such) watering places. '28 

The sin of killing or harming a cow (govadha) is listed first in the catalogue of minor offences (upapātika) given, for example, in Manu XI.60–7. Gaut.III.4.18 equates it with the murder of a vaiśya, Āp.I.9.26.1 with that of a sudra. The penalties imposed vary considerably (e.g. Manu XI.108–16; Yājñ.III.263-4; Vis.Sm. 50.16-24, etc.). However, the statement that there is no prāyaścitta powerful enough to atone for the sin of govadha conflicts with the traditional view that every 'sin' or mistake is matched by a given prāyaścitta (cf. Gonda 1980:288 ff.). This issue becomes especially significant in Tryambaka's discussion of sahagamana (see pp. 291– 8). 

The second passage, also consisting of slokas taken out of sequence from different chapters of the Mahabharata, begins by describing the form that the daily worship of cows should take. 'One should purify oneself and then, standing among the cows, one should repeat in one's mind the gomatīmantra: “I always see the cows. May the cows always see me! The cows belong to us and we belong to them. Where the cows are there we are also. I bow my head in worship to the cow for she is the mother of the past and the future and by her the whole universe of moving and unmoving things is pervaded." One should neither go to sleep without praising cows nor get up without remembering them.

If one pays homage to cows morning and evening, one becomes prosperous. If a man (naraḥ) praises cows in this way both day and night, in rough times or smooth, and even in times of great fear (or danger), he will be freed from (that) fear (or danger). If one wants a son, one obtains a son; the same goes for wealth too; a woman who wants sexual pleasure will gain a husband; indeed men (mānavaḥ, superordinate) may obtain whatever they desire. Men (mānavaḥ, hyponym) who are devoted to cows obtain whatever they desire; and women who are devoted to cows obtain their desire (too). Indeed, O Bhārata, nothing is hard to obtain for one devoted to cows!'29 

Devotion to cows is thus another pre-dawn āhnika duty. It is to be observed by women as well as men. If a woman wants a son, or marital happiness, or anything else, she has only to devote herself to the care and worship of cows. In more general terms, the care of cows by the higher castes is held to be of great merit precisely because it is dirty work that servants can be called upon to do. It is thus an important ritual act, especially in south India. It seems likely, however, that these rulings are intended not so much for the older established woman of the household but for her new daughter(s)-in-law. We may also note that the recitation of the gomatīmantra constitutes an exception to Tryambaka's blanket prohibition on mantras for women (e.g. section V, p. 278, notes 7-8) presumably because it is not from a Vedic text.

standing worship of the cow as a divinity, as evidenced in the earliest Sanskrit texts, see PVK II.ii.772–5. 

Ablutions, etc. (Sdhp.4r.4-7v.9) 

Urinating and defecating (mūtrapurīṣotsargaḥ; Sdhp.4r.4–4v.3). First, what is the ritual significance of this? Tryambaka explains that, before performing any religious ritual, 'it is necessary to urinate and so on because one who has not done so is not entitled to participate in religious ritual.' The proof of this is to be found in the unattributed statement that ‘one who has held back (urine and excrement) should not perform a ritual.'30 This ruling recalls the ayurvedic distinction between urges which should be suppressed (greed, grief, fear, anger, etc.) and those which should not (natural urges relating to urine, faeces, semen, vomiting, sneezing and so on). Caraka devotes a subsection to this topic, beginning with the importance of not withholding urine and faeces (na vegān dhārayed dhīmāñ jātān mūtrapurīṣayoḥ). He proceeds to deal with each urge in turn, listing the ailments that result from suppressing it and the remedies to counteract them (Car.I.VII). The ritual consequences, however, are ignored. 

Secondly, Tryambaka describes the 'appropriate place' where, according to Āpastamba, this should be done. 'One should urinate and defecate far from one's house, either to the south (the direction of Yama) or to the south-west (that of Nirṛti; cf. Gonda 1980: 52-7).'31 But, according to a quotation attributed vaguely to 'traditional teaching' (smaraṇāt), 'this applies (only) to the daytime.' For practical purposes, 'daytime' here includes the early pre-dawn

The latter reading is probably influenced by the better-known sloka from Manu that begins: dūrād avasathām mūtram ...(Manu IV.151; Sm.M.II.p.211; Par.M.I.i.p.224; Sm.C. II.p.237).

hours of morning (strictly speaking, the last division of the night). 'For it is said that one should urinate and defecate near one's house at night.'32 

For the details of how it should be done, Tryambaka turns to Angiras. ‘Rising in the last division of night, one should sip water and cover the ground with grass. Then, in a clean place, with concentrated mind, covering one's head with one's garment, and resolutely refraining from speech, spitting and breathing (out), one should urinate and defecate.'33 As for why one should not speak, spit or breathe out, the answer is presumably ‘unseen merit' (adṛṣṭārtha), the stock answer when the reason for a ruling is not obvious (see p. 58). 

"The rule concerning the direction one should face at the various times' is provided by Gautama. 'One should urinate and defecate while facing north during the day and at dawn and dusk, but facing south at night.'34 There are in fact a number of other rulings that Tryambaka might have given instead. Yama, for example suggests facing west in the first part of the day, east in the next, north at midday, and south at night. Devala opts for facing north in the morning, south in the evening; or, as Manu phrases it, north in the daytime and south at night (Sm.C.II.p. 236-7). However all seem to agree that the two twilight periods of dawn and dusk should if possible be avoided, always bearing in mind that one should never obstruct these calls of nature, 35 

Finally, Gautama provides a list of the specific places where one should neither urinate nor defecate: 'on ashes, on cow-dung (karī

şam; glossed as gomayam), in a ploughed field, in the shade (glossed as “in which one rests", e.g. in the shade of a tree, cf. Ap.1.30.16; one may urinate on one's own shadow, v.17), on the road, or in (any other) desirable places.'36 Moreover, ‘one should not void urine, excrement or any other impurity while facing the wind, fire, a brahmin, water, (the image of) a deity, or a cow.'37 The other 'impurities', listed as twelve in Manu V.135 (cf. Sm.C.II.p. 250), include semen, blood, mucus, phlegm, tears and sweat. The Visnupurāna (as quoted by Sm.C.II.p.239) includes women among the things or people one should not face at such a time, along with the wind, fire, the moon, the sun, one's guru, and a brahmin. 

Clearly none of the rulings given by Tryambaka concerning mūtrapurīṣotsarga are gender specific. He has simply taken rules originally intended for men and applied them to women too. 

Cleansing rituals (saucam; Sdhp.4v.3-5r.4) 

'One should cleanse oneself immediately', a process defined by Tryambaka as 'causing both smell and trace to be removed'. 38 Two verses from Gautama repeat this definition of saucam. ‘Cleansing in the sense of removing all trace and smell of impurity is achieved by using first earth and then water.'39 Manu adds that as long as smell or trace remain, one must continue to apply earth and water (V.126; cf.Yajñ.I.17). 

For 'the earth appropriate to women' (strīnām mr [d]), Tryambaka turns to Marici. 'In the case of women and südras, black (earth is to be used).'40 This rule amplifies Marici's statement (quoted in Sm.C.II.p.242) that different coloured earth is appropriate for each varna: white for brahmins, red for kṣatriyas, yellow for vaiśyas, and black for sudras. It is no surprise that women of all varnas

are grouped with śūdras here. However, ‘if one is unable to find the particular earth prescribed'—in Mahabaleshwar, for example, the earth is predominantly red; around Pune, predominantly black-then 'any kind will do.' As Tryambaka and Manu declare, 'whatever water or earth is to be found in a given place, that is recommended and with that the cleansing should be done.'41 The Smrticandrikā modifies this statement further by listing all the places from which one may not take earth for this purpose: from rat-infested ground, molehills, a road (Yama); earth containing fire, grain husks, insects, bones (Devala); from an anthill, from water, from a house, from cultivated land (Vis.P.); and so on (Sm.C.II.p. 242-3). But none of these rulings are in any way exclusive to women. 

For the rules concerning which hand to use (hastaniyama[h]), Tryambaka consults Devala. 'One who knows dharma should not use his right hand for cleansing his lower body; equally he should not cleanse above his navel with his left hand.'42 

For the amount of earth to be used each time (mṛiparimāṇam), Tryambaka quotes Sātātapa. 'The morsels (of food) prescribed for the induvrata are the size of ripe (lit. 'moist' or 'juicy') āmalaka fruit, as are all oblations and also the lumps of earth used for cleansing oneself.'43 The induvrata or 'moon ritual' (also called cāndrāyaṇa) is a particular kind of controlled fast that lasts for thirty days and in the course of which the amount of food eaten reflects the waxing and waning of the moon. (The yavamadhya form begins with one morsel of food, increases by a morsel per day until the fifteenth day, and returns to one, thus being fat in the middle like a barley corn (yava). The pipīlikamadhya form begins

with fifteen morsels, decreases to one on the fifteenth day, and then works back to fifteen, thus being thin in the middle like an ant (pipīlika; cf. Baudh.III.8.33; Mit. on Yājñ.III.323; Manu XI.217– 18; Vas.23.45,27.21; Vis.Sm. 47.5-6.) · 

Šātātapa also provides the reference for the number of lumps of earth to be used (mṛtsāmkhy[ā]). 'Cleansing urine is reckoned to take one lump of earth for the penis, three for the left hand, two more for both hands; and cleansing faeces, twice as many. In the case of women and sudras, however, half as many is recommended by the wise.' 44 The mention of the male organ (linga) demonstrates the male reference of the original ruling. Moreover, the Smṛticandrikā version concludes with a ruling related to the voiding of semen not faeces. The last half-sloka is the first of the two examples of rulings specific to women discussed by Tryambaka in his introductory section (see section I, p. 39, note 25). Both the Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 19) and Dakṣa (V.12) add that half of the sauca requirements are necessary at night; a quarter if one is sick; an eighth if one is on a journey; and that no particular number is prescribed for women, sūdras, and boys who have not yet undergone the upanayana ritual. This recalls my discussion above of the inconsistency entailed in equating on the one hand women in general with sūdras, and on the other unmarried women with uninitiated high-caste boys (section I, pp. 34–9). This example, in which women whether married or not are grouped together with both sudras and uninitiated high-caste boys, merely adds to the confusion. 

For the order in which the cleansing process should be carried out (krama[ḥ]), Tryambaka quotes Vyasa. 'First, one should cleanse oneself of faecal matter, then of urine; next, one should cleanse one's feet, and after that one's hands.'45

Finally, we return to the point at which Tryambaka began in his introduction. The unattributed and partial quotation given there (section I, note 8) is now attributed to Baudhāyana and given in full. It concerns 'the problem caused by not performing the purification rituals described'. 'One must make a constant effort to cleanse oneself (properly), for only then is one essentially pure, a (true) dvija; if one fails to perform these rituals of purification, then one's actions will bear no fruit.'46 The confusion about the status of women is very obvious here. In order to apply the ruling to women, we must invoke the ūha of gender. But the exhortation is to behave like a true dvija and women are repeatedly classed with sudras. It seems that women are meant to be inspired in one place, humbled in the next, but are certainly never expected to think the matter through. As to what is meant by 'proper cleansing', Mit. on Yājñ.1.17 gives the most sensible answer: one need only use as much earth and water as is necessary to remove all trace and smell. The numbers of lumps actually prescribed are there for 'unseen' (adrṣṭa) reasons; hence, for example, the rather startling ruling (given by Tryambaka himself in section IV, p. 286), that a woman who is menstruating requires sixty lumps to cleanse herself on the fourth day, a widow who is menstruating twice as many. 

With regard to the practices described in both this section and the previous one, Vidyarṇava remarks with satisfaction that they are easily followed in Indian villages even today. Indeed he laments their abandonment in the cities where 'every house has got its privy.' In his view, 'the old system' provided a number of advantages which are lacking in the new: early morning exercise ('whether they liked it or not'); no need for 'costly systems of sanitation and drainage'; and it did not compel a whole class of people (sweepers) 'to a degraded form of livelihood'. Most important of all, it kept houses clean without 'the necessity of setting apart a portion of it for the accumulation of filth' (1979:12-13). We may assume that many traditionalists today would share his opinion that modern sanitation is in fact a change for the worse.

[[75]]

The sipping ritual (ācamanam; Sdhp.5r.4–5v.1) First, as Devala explains, acamana must be performed as soon as sauca is completed. 'When one has washed with water each foot in turn as far as the knee, one should wash both hands as far as the wrist, and then perform acamana.'47 In fact, ācamana is a preliminary to all ritual acts (cf. Har. on Āp.1.5.15.1; Gobh.gṛ.1.1.2). It is to be performed before reciting the Veda (Manu V.138), both before and after meals, after sleeping, sneezing and spitting (cf. Gaut.I.1.40; Manu V.145; Gobh.gr.1.2.32), as well as after urinating or defecating (cf. acamananimittāni; Sm.C.II.p.260 ff.). That a male reference is usually assumed is demonstrated by the ruling that one should perform acamana after touching a woman, or after talking to a woman or a sudra during a meal. 

A sloka from Yājñavalkya explains how this sipping should be done (ācamanaprakāra[ḥ]). 'Sitting in a clean place, with one's hands between one's knees (antarjānu), and facing either north or east, a dvija should always sip (water) from the base of the thumb (brahmatīrtha).'48 The term antarjānu indicates a sitting posture with the knees spread (cf. Gonda 1980:62-3). The brahmatīrtha at the base of the thumb is one of several sacred spots on the hand. The others, according to Yājñ.1.19 and Viș.Sm.62.1-4, are the base of the smallest finger (prājāpatyatirtha); the base of the index finger (pitṛtīrtha); and the tips of the fingers (daivatīrtha). Once again, we have the irony of a ruling for the dvija (now reclassified as male) being applied to women (who are consistently grouped with śūdras). 

More important, Tryambaka omits the usual directives in such contexts (and in that of mūtrapurīṣotsarga; cf. Yājñ.I.1.16; Sm.C.II. p.235-6) concerning the sacred thread (yajñopavīta). The equivalent instruction in Gautama, for example, reads: sitting in a clean place, placing one's right arm between one's knees, and wearing the sacred thread (yajñopavītī), one should wash both

[[76]]

hands as far as the wrist... and so on (Gaut.I.1.35; Par.M.I.i. p.235). Haradatta glosses yajñopavītī in two ways: first, as having the sacred thread in its normal place (over the left shoulder, cf. Manu II.63; Gobh.gr.1.2.2); and alternatively, as referring to the arrangement of one's upper garment (athavottarīyavinyāsārtham). This seems to be yet another example of a reference to an initiated person being reinterpreted so that it can be applied to the uninitiated. However, Haradatta proceeds to quote Baudh.I.5.15.1, according to which one should be yajñopavītī on a number of different occasions including during the acamana ritual, and as he does so the alternative interpretation seems increasingly inappropriate. Yet Bühler has preferred this second interpretation in his translation of both passages (1975:54, 180-1). Tryambaka, however, has done his best to avoid the issue altogether. But even the quotation he has selected (Yājñ.1.18; see note 48) includes the term dvija, glossed in the Mitākṣarā as na sūdrādiḥ, an expression that surely excludes women too. 

Nonetheless, it is obvious that neither Tryambaka nor Yājñavalkya wish to prevent women or sudras from performing the aca- mana ritual. For at the end of this subsection, Tryambaka quotes Yājñ.I.21 to declare that 'dvijas are purified by water reaching the heart, throat and palate respectively; women and sūdras by merely touching it once.'49 The second half of this sloka is the other example of rulings specific to women given in Tryambaka's introduction (section I, p. 40, note 26). The last phrase (sakṛt sprṣṭābhir antataḥ) has been variously interpreted, as has the equivalent phrase of Manu II.62 (sūdrah sprstābhir antatah). Antatah is glossed either as antena meaning 'at the extremity (of mouth or lips)', or as antar- gatena meaning 'inside (the mouth, Mit.). Kullūka specifies that water need only touch the extremity of the tongue and lips (cf. Apar.), even if it does not reach the throat; Rāghavānanda the tip of the tongue; Nandana the outside edge of the lips. Ramacandra prefers the more straightforward and strictly grammatical inter- pretation of 'finally' to indicate that (although strī is not in fact specified in the Manu quotation) women and sudras constitute

the last varna category. 50 Whichever interpretation is accepted, how- ever, women are entitled to perform acamana. But, once again, both the intrinsic impurity of sūdras and the lower standards of purification required of them are ascribed to women. 

Tryambaka quotes two further slokas on the water to be used for sipping (ācamanārtham udakam). First, according to Parāśara, 'one should sip water that has been "drawn up” (i.e. from a well or river or other source of fresh water), free of foam or bubbles, neither heated by fire nor brackish (akṣāra; glossed by Nand. on Vis. Sm. 62.5 as "any bad water")'.51 Or, to use Yajnavalkya's phrase, one should use water in its natural state (prakṛtisthābhiḥ; Yajñ.1.20). The second sloka, attributed to Pracetas, adds two exceptions (višeṣam). First, 'according to the wise, (acamana has the desired) purifying effect at night even when one uses water one cannot see.' Secondly, 'hot water (is allowed) in the case of sick people who are in the habit of drinking hot water.'52 The latter point refers to the traditional view, based on ayurvedic practices, that people suffering from fever (jvara) should drink hot water and never cold. In such a state, it is believed that one should observe a strict fast; only water is allowed, and this should be boiled and served warm on the grounds that cold water heightens fever (Jolly 1901:70-4). Tryambaka does not concern himself with the mass of rules relating to when sipping should be done (ācamananimitṭāni; e.g. Sm.C. II.p. 260 ff.); when it should be done twice (dviracamana- nimittāni; e.g. Sm.C.II.p.264 ff.); nor the various exceptions and prohibitions relating to it (e.g. Sm.C.II.p.265 ff.).

Cleaning the teeth (dantadhavanam; Sdhp.5v.1–9) 

According to Sat.Br.X.5.2.11-12, the mouth is clammy in the morning because the two internal deities that live in the eyes (cf. section IIC, p.215 below) have been making love all night and shedding seed. Tryambaka merely remarks that, according to Atri, 'when the mouth is stale (i.e. after the night's sleep), men (naraḥ, superordinate) are always impure; one should therefore chew on (lit. 'eat') either a green (lit. 'moist') or a dry teeth-cleaning twig.'53 This is still the practice in villages today, and even in towns teeth-cleaning sticks are sold on busy railway stations. In terms of āhnika, it is an independent ritual act rendering the mouth (as opposed to the whole body) pure. It is therefore not simply a part (anga) of the morning bath (cf. Vīr.Ā.p.121). 

In comparison with other smrti sections on teeth-cleaning twigs, Tryambaka's is brief. In Vis.Sm.61, for example, there are detailed rules concerning the types of twig that may or may not be used, varying from those of particular trees (cf. Br.Sam.85) to those with particular qualities (sweet, sour, withered, perforated, smelly, smooth and so on). Even more surprising is Tryambaka's omission of the gender specific rules concerning the appropriate length of a teeth-cleaning twig. According to Vis.Sm.61.16, the twig should be as thick as one's little finger and twelve angulas long. The Smṛti- candrikā, however, quotes Garga to prove that the length of the twig should vary according to one's asrama and gender: ten angulas for a brahmin, nine for a kṣatriya, eight for a vaiśya, seven for a śūdra, and four for a woman (Sm.C.II.p.278). If one takes this to be the usual diminishing scale of ritual purity, then even high-caste women are now not equal to but inferior to the sudra male. Perhaps Tryambaka did not wish to go that far. 

For an alternative to the teeth-cleaning twig, Tryambak'a turns to the Smrtyarthasara. 'One may clean one's teeth with one's fingers but one should avoid using the index finger; strong teeth 

[^53]: atha dantadhāvanam // Sdhp.5v.1. tatrātriḥ // mukhe paryușite nityam bhavanty aprayatā narāḥ / tad ārdrakāṣtham suskam va bhakṣayed danta- dhāvanam // Sdhp.5v.1-2 (Atri) < Par.M.I.i.p.252 (bhavaty aprayato naraḥ for bhavanty aprayatā narāḥ; Atri); Sm.M.II.p.240 (as Par.M.; dhāvane for 'dhavanam; Atri); LaghuSat.74 (as Par.M.; tasmāt sarvaprayatnena for tad ārdrakāstham suskam vā); Śm.C.II.p.276 (Śāt.; as LaghuŚāt).

[[79]]

are formed by using the middle finger, the fourth (or ring-) finger, or the thumb.'54 The arbitrary nature of this ruling becomes evident when it is compared with similar pronouncements in the Smṛti- candrikā. The latter explains, for example, both that one may not use one's fingers except the thumb and fourth finger; and that one may use grass, leaves, water or one's fingers, but not the fourth finger (Sm.C.II.p.272 ff.). 

The days on which one should not clean one's teeth (varja- divasā[h]) are listed in a sloka that Tryambaka attributes to Visnu. 'One should avoid cleaning one's teeth on a day when offerings are made to the dead, on one's birthday, on the day of a marriage, when one is suffering from indigestion (ajīrṇa), when one is observ- ing a vow (vrate), and on a fast day.'55 Since these rulings concern matters of ritual rather than bodily purity, we may assume that on the days mentioned, although the stale taste of morning may persist in the mouth, it will not render one ritually impure. 

Tryambaka explains that 'since the above prohibition on teeth- cleaning on a fast day applies (as it stands; i.e. assuming the üha of gender) to women as well as to men, Manu adds a modifying rule for women.'56 It runs as follows. 'None of these are polluting to women on a fast day: flowers, ornaments, clothes, perfume, ointment, cleaning the teeth and collyrium (for the eyes).'57 The implication is that a man undergoing a fast is polluted by these things. However, according to Tryambaka's next quotation, attri- buted to Visnu, this modification is itself modified if a woman's husband is away (proṣitabhartṛkāṇam viseṣam): the prohibition 

[^54]: smrtyarthasăre // angulya dhavayed dantan varjayet tu pradesinīm / madhyamānāmikānguṣṭhair dantadārḍhyam bhavaty api // Sdhp.5v.3–4 (Sm.A.) Sm.A.p.25 (trnaparṇodakenāngulyā vā dantan dhāvayet pradesini varjyam...); Sm.M.II.p.244 (dantadhavo for dantadārdhyam; Sm.A.).

[[80]]

on teeth-cleaning is reapplied (cf. section IV, p. 291). Thus, ‘if her husband is away, a woman should not eat on a day when offerings are made to the dead, or on the day of a sacrifice, or when she is observing a vow (niyame); and in this context "she should not eat" means "she should not clean her teeth."'58 The gloss derives from the fact that the twig is chewed at one end to form a brush with which the teeth are cleaned. 

This issue of teeth-cleaning, never clearly spelled out, seems to involve three quite distinct aspects, each relevant at the appropriate time and to the appropriate individual. First, as mentioned above, it is an independent ritual act to make the mouth pure after the night's sleep. If this is not done, one remains ritually impure, and thus unable to participate in the ritual aspects of the coming day. In the case of women, the matter is somewhat confused by the well-known saying that a woman's mouth is always pure (Manu V.130). However, as I explain in section III in relation to Tryam- baka's discussion of the unique purity of women, this means merely that a woman's mouth is always pure for her husband to kiss. If this were not so, he would too easily render himself impure. But this is a special case. It is not designed to excuse women from the ritual act of cleaning their teeth in the early morning. We may also note in passing that the saying arose because of the general assumption that women are a priori impure; hence the need to make an exception for the intimate relations of husband and wife. There is no equivalent assumption concerning the impurity of men and therefore no need for a parallel statement that a man's mouth is always pure for his wife to kiss. 

Secondly, cleaning the teeth is a sensual pleasure. The Vedic student, for example, is enjoined to avoid such pleasures as sleeping on a bed, cleaning his teeth, bathing for pleasure, applying collyrium to his eyes or ointments to his body, wearing shoes or carrying a parasol (Vas.VII.15). Gautama too specifies both bathing and cleaning the teeth among the pleasures to be avoided by the Vedic 

[^58]: proșitabhartṛkānām viseṣam āha visnuḥ // Sdhp.5v.7. śrāddhe yajñe ca niyame nādyāt proṣitabhartṛkā / nadyat dantadhavanam na kuryād ity arthaḥ || iti // Sdhp.5v.8 (Viṣṇu) < Sm.M.p.244 (first half-sloka only; Mādha- viya); Par.M.I.i.p.253 (first half-śloka only; niyamān for niyame; Vyāsa); Sm.C.II.p.277 (first half-sloka only; patyau ca proșite tatha for nādyāt proṣitabhartṛkā; Vyāsa).

student; the others include honey, meat, perfumes, garlands, sleeping in the daytime, playing musical instruments, dancing and singing (I.2.19). Haradatta glosses snānam as 'bathing for pleasure' (sukhārtham uṣnatoyādina kanthad adhaḥ prakṣālanam); danta- dhāvanam as 'removing dirt from the teeth' (dantamalāpakarṣaṇam). Both are described as bodily rather than ritual acts, performed for obvious (drsta) not otherworldly (adrṣta) reasons. Āp.I.2.7.11 declares simply that the Vedic student should be dusty (rajasvalo malinagātraḥ, Ujj.); and that he should have dirty teeth (raktadan, 'having red or discoloured teeth', a Vedic form, glossed by Ujj. as pakvadanta [h], 'decaying teeth'). Even after the student has completed his Vedic studies, he may not indulge in such sensual pleasures in his teacher's presence. Thus if his teacher visits him or if he visits his teacher, he may not wear garlands, oil his hair, wear a turban or shoes and so on, or clean his teeth until he is once more out of his teacher's sight (Āp.1.2.8.1-5). Clearly, this is the context in which to understand the prohibitions on teeth-cleaning given by Tryambaka. On a śrāddha day, on a day when one is observ- ing a vow or fast (in the case of men), one should not indulge in the sensual pleasure of cleaning the teeth. 

But this does not explain why the rule for fasting should supersede the usual āhnika rule for teeth-cleaning only with respect to men. The ruling makes sense, however, if we allow a third aspect to the issue of teeth-cleaning: that of making oneself attractive; an aspect that seems to be applied more regularly to women than to men. Since women are expected to make themselves attractive as long as their husbands are around, the rule for fasting is waived in their case. But as soon as their husbands go away, the wife need (indeed, should) no longer make herself attractive: the rule for fasting is reimposed and therefore she should not clean her teeth (see section IV, p. 291). We may also note that cleaning the teeth is one of the many activities to be avoided by the menstruating woman until after her ritual bath on the fourth day (see section IV, pp. 286-7). Since a man is not supposed to have sexual intercourse with his wife at this time, it makes sense that she should not make herself attractive to him; indeed, as Tryambaka explains in his section on general behaviour, the menstruating woman should keep her mouth hidden from her husband in order to discourage him from polluting himself (Sdhp.23v.3-4 Sk.P.III.2.7.26b-27a; section IV, pp. 273-4). 

[[82]]

However, there are two further contradictions here. First, in his list of things to be avoided (varjanīyāḥ), Tryambaka rules that austerities (tapas) are not to be observed by women (section IV, p. 275, note 7); yet fasting is clearly a form of tapas. Secondly, according to Tryambaka (and Manu), marriage is for women the equivalent of upanayana for men, and serving her husband the equivalent of serving one's teacher (section I, p.35, notes 15, 16), Yet the behaviour required of the Vedic student is specifically not applied to the married woman except when her husband is away or dead. In fact, only the woman whose husband is away, and the widow, are actually expected to adopt the behaviour and lifestyle of the Vedic student (section IV, pp. 291, 299-300). While the analogy remains an uplifting one, therefore, in practice the wife's service to her husband is equivalent to the student's service to his teacher only when the husband-teacher is no longer there. 

Finally, the rule that one who suffers from indigestion (ajīrņa; see note 55) should also not clean his teeth suggests that there is a fourth or ayurvedic aspect to the matter. Other remedies include sleeping in the daytime, and pills or stomach rubs made of pepper, asafoetida and so on (Jolly 1901:77). 

The ritual bath (snanam; Sdhp.6v.5-7r.3) 

After a brief section on looking after cows (gosevanam; see above, pp. 65-9), Tryambaka proceeds to enumerate the various rulings concerning the pre-dawn ritual bath.59 Before dealing with these, it is necessary to comment briefly on ritual bathing in general. 

First, the bath required for cleansing purposes is called 'dirt- removing' (malakarṣaṇa) and is another issue altogether (Sm.C.II. p.290). This is the bath performed 'for pleasure' that is forbidden to the Vedic student (Har. on Gaut.I.2.19; Āp.I.2.7.11; Vas. VII.15). Secondly, the ritual bath is of three kinds: nitya (obligatory, i.e. every day); naimittika (on particular occasions); and kāmya (if one desires particular rewards; cf. Dakṣa II.48; Sm.C.II.p.291). Tryambaka is concerned primarily with nityasnāna, the daily bath obligatory to all varnas (cf. Baudh.II.4.3b; Sm.A.p.26; Sm.C.II. pp. 291 ff.; only briefly with naimittikasnāna; and not at all with kāmyasnāna. 

The number of obligatory (nitya) baths prescribed for a man varies according to his aśrama: one for the Vedic student, two for 

[^59]: atha snānam //Sdhp.6v.5.

[[83]]

householders, two or three for forest hermits, and three for the renunciate (cf. Yajñ.1.95,100, III.48; Manu VI.6, 22; Sm.C.II. p.483; Sm.A.p.26, etc.). If one bathes only once, it must be shortly before dawn; if twice, before dawn and at midday; if three times, before dawn, at midday and shortly before sunset. When we look at the āhnika duties set out by Tryambaka for women, however, we see that the midday bath normally prescribed for their husbands is omitted. Since Tryambaka does not draw attention to it, it is not clear whether the omission is significant or not. However, we may also note that, since there is no distinction according to varna, women cannot here be grouped together with sudras. By default, therefore, they are now classed with the least advanced āśrama for men, that of the (temporary, not perpetual) Vedic student. This recalls, perhaps unintentionally, the claim that marriage for a woman is equivalent to Vedic studentship for a man (Manu II.67; see section I, notes 15,16). If the omission is significant, then this is one of the few aspects of the lifestyle of the Vedic student that the married woman adopts. 

Tryambaka's first point, attributed to Visnu, is that 'for brahmins, kṣatriyas and vaisyas, the (ritual) bath must be performed with mantras; for sūdras and women-O son of the Kurus-it is silent (i.e. without mantras).60 According to Baudhayana, 'bath- ing in the sense of total immersion (in water) is enjoined as fulfilling all desires; while sprinkling (the body) with water while reciting mantras is restricted to the twice-born.'61 This is the logical con- sequence of the exclusion of women from Vedic studentship. Despite the compensatory 'initiation' of marriage, women are classed in ritual terms with the uninitiated. Hence their ritual bath is 'silent': the recitation of mantras is forbidden. 

Tryambaka's second point is that ‘a woman should not bathe naked.'62 According to Vyasa, 'a woman should never be alone, nor 

[^60]: tatra viṣṇuḥ// brahmakṣatravisām caiva mantravat snānam iṣyate/ tūṣṇīm eva hi šūdrasya strīnām ca kurunundana ¡¡ iti ¡¡ Sdhp.6v.5-6 (Visnu) < Sm.C.II.p.484 (under mādhyamdinasnānam; Visnu); Par.I.i.p.271 (Visņu). Cf. Sm.A.p.26.

[[84]]

should she ever bathe naked.'63 This quotation is also included in a longer passage attributed to the Skandapurāṇa in the section on general behaviour (Sdhp.23v.7, section IV, pp. 273-4). The first point recalls Manu's remark that a woman should never be independent but always supervised by a man whether father, husband or son (Manu IX.3, V.147-8; Gaut.II.9.1; cf. section IV, p. 276, note 9). It also recalls the warnings that even a learned man should not spend time with a woman alone (e.g. Manu II.213-15). The implication is that a woman alone will either get up to mischief or come to harm. This kind of ruling derives from the view that women are inherently unfaithful, promiscuous and weak-willed, a view that Tryambaka himself discusses (and supports, with qualifications) in his comments on the inherent nature of women (strīsvabhāva; see section III). The second point, that one should not bathe naked, is also applied to men; in this context, 'naked' (nagnah) is taken to mean a man wearing only one garment (i.e. a loin-cloth) instead of two (e.g. Kull. on Manu IV.45; Nand. on Vis.Sm.64.5; Gaut.1.9.60-1, etc.). 

The Smṛtyarthasara provides Tryambaka with a further rule specific to women. 'Whenever a man is required to bathe "with his clothes on" (sacelam; i.e. as opposed to with just his lower garment), a woman whose husband is living (suvāsinī) should not bathe her head; similarly, if one has a headache or matted hair (one should also not bathe the head).'64 Curiously, according to ayurveda, while one of the causes of a headache is drinking too much water, one of the treatments is immersing the head in cold (though never hot) water, the opposite of what is stated here (Jolly 1901:118). 

Suvāsinī means literally ‘a woman with fine clothes'. But a word or phrase may have three meanings or functions (vrtti). According to the primary or literal function (abhidhã or, for the mīmāmsaka, śakti; Nyāyakośa p.854), the statement 'the cowherd's house is on the Ganges' (gangāyām ghoṣaḥ) means that it is magically perched upon the water. According to the secondary or indirect

function (lakṣaṇā), it is on the bank of the river (gangātīre ghoṣaḥ; Mīmāmsākosa VI.pp. 3340 ff.). According to the third or suggested function (vyañjanā), it is in a cool and sacred place. Lakṣaṇā may also be of two types: that in which the context gives the meaning, as in the example of the cowherd's house; and nirūḍhalakṣaṇā, in which the indirect meaning is now the established one regardless of the context. Suvāsinī is in this last category. A widow is not permitted to wear fine clothes (section IV, pp. 299–300); a well- dressed woman therefore cannot be a widow. So engrained are these ideas that the term no longer refers to a woman's clothes at all but solely and directly to her marital state. Similarly, the literal meanings of subhagā and durbhagă ('fortunate woman' and 'un- fortunate woman'; see section IIA, pp. 55-6), have given place completely to the established meanings (nirūḍhalakṣaṇā) of ‘woman whose husband is living' and 'widow'. For a woman's good fortune is judged and marked by the survival of her husband. The masculine equivalents of these terms, on the other hand, have no such establish- ed meanings; they refer in fact to a man's clothes and his fortune. 

As for the reference to washing the head, the widow may well have had her head shaved (an issue that Tryambaka considers in section IV, pp. 303-4). The suvāsinī, by contrast, would have a full head of hair, the washing of which would presumably be too time-consum- ing on a purely ritual occasion. The special occasions on which a man is obliged to bathe 'with his clothes on' (i.e. naimittikasnanam) are without exception due to inauspicious and therefore polluting causes: if he has touched an outcaste, a candāla, a woman who is menstruating or has recently given birth, a corpse and so on (cf. Gaut.II.5.28-30; Manu V.85, 103; Mit. on Yajñ.III.30; Sm.C.I. p.118). Vas.IV.38 specifies that he should submerge both his body and his head. Hence the modifying rule for the married woman, whose hair is invariably long; for the ascetic with long matted hair; and for one suffering from a headache. 

Tryambaka's last point in this sub-section explains that 'this bathing should be done in rivers and so on.'65 In a quotation attri- buted to the Harivamsa, Uma explains to Arundhati. "The flowing water of a river is recommended (for bathing), O daughter of Soma; and bathing in a clean tank or pond that is both large and full of fish (or lotuses) is also recommended; but always in daylight. But if this is not possible, if a woman is confined (to the

[[86]]

house; for example, when she is pregnant), then she should bathe from an earthenware pot; and she may use the water of nine pots. This is the ancient law.'66 In his comments on pregnancy, Tryam- baka adds that a pregnant woman should take her bath with warm water (kosnena vārinā; Sdhp.40 r. 10-40 v.1, section IV, 

pp. 288-91). The directive that one should as far as possible bathe in fresh water is frequently given: that is, in rivers, ponds, lakes, water- holes, springs, waterfalls and temple tanks 'dug by the gods' (cf. Manu IV.203; Vis.Sm.64.16-17). What is not recommended is bathing in water belonging to someone else, such as a well or a reservoir built by him, for in doing so one partakes of that man's sin (cf. Manu IV.201–2; Viș.Sm.64.1; Yājñ.I.159). If one is unable to bathe in the right places, then, as Tryambaka explains, one may bathe in one's own courtyard or house using water from pots. According to Vis. Sm.64.17, however, the most effective water for ritual purposes is that of the Ganges (cf. also Ag.P.155.6); the least effective is that brought in pots. 

About the details of the actual bath-the kind of earth to be used for washing, which clothes one may wear, at what point and in what manner one may enter the water, and so on - Tryambaka says nothing. Nor does he give any rulings concerning tarpana, the offering of water to the gods, ṛṣis and ancestors, normally performed as a part (anga) of the ritual bath. All the many mantras prescribed for twice-born men are, of course, omitted. Tryambaka also fails to mention kāmyasnāna, the ritual bath performed in order to obtain specific rewards. But since this is most often per- formed when on a pilgrimage to a sacred tīrtha, and since Tryambaka discourages both men and women from going on such pilgrimages (see section IIB, pp. 134-7), this omission is not inconsistent. The prohibitions on bathing for the menstruating woman, and the obligation to bathe on the fourth day of her menstrual cycle, are dealt with in section IV, pp. 284–7. 

With regard to the nakedness of women, but outside the specific context of bathing, we may note in passing that the term nagnikā has an interesting history. Several of the gṛhyasutras recommend a nagnikā bride. The term is defined by Vaikh.6.12 as one between the ages of eight and ten (astavarṣādā daśaman nagnikā). At the

[[87]]

time of the earlier grhyasūtras, however, the custom of marrying an adolescent girl was only just beginning to give way to that of child marriage. Thus Gobh.gr.III.4.3-6 makes a general statement about the gotra of the (presumably adolescent) bride, then adds as an afterthought that a nagnikā is best (nagnikā tu śreṣṭhā; v.6). Măn.gr.I.7.8 recommends successively a girl who has not yet experienced sexual intercourse (kanyam aspṛṣṭamaithunām), who is younger than the groom (yavīyasīm), and a nagnikā. Astāvakra's commentary defines the latter term as 'one who has not yet develop- ed female sexual characteristics' (aprāptastrībhāvām ayauvan- arasām). The reference to sexual inexperience suggests that an adolescent bride was the accepted custom, and thus that the require- ment of a nagnikā or pre-adolescent girl is an afterthought. If the latter were the rule, the former epithet would-one hopes-be unnecessary. Mātṛdatta's commentary on what is almost certainly an incorrect reading of Hir.gr.1.19.2 clearly demonstrates this overlap in marriage customs. Faced with the apparent ruling that a man should marry a bride who is both a nagnikā and a brahma- cāriņī (i.e. leading a celibate life), Mātṛdatta seeks to evade the con- tradiction by defining the former as 'one who has begun to menstru- ate (nagnikām āsannārtavām) and who is therefore fit to throw aside her clothes (tasmad vastravik ṣepaṇārhā nagnikā), that is, fit for sexual intercourse (maithunārhety arthah).' This obviously con- tradicts the accepted definition of the term. 

In fact, Hir.gr.1.19.2 should read anagnikā (Bhandarkar 1893: 151 ff.; Thieme 1971:174). Thieme discusses the implications of both terms. He divides the life of a woman into four stages: bālya ('childhood'; i.e. until menstruation); kaumāra ('unmarried girl- hood'; i.e. the three years or, according to some, three months following puberty, during which period a husband should be found); yauvana ('youth'; i.e. a woman's child-bearing years); and sthavira ('old age'; i.e. beyond child-bearing). Hence a woman should be protected by her father in her girlhood (kaumāre), by her husband in her married life (yauvane), and by her son in her old age (sthavire; Vas. V.3; Manu IX.3 etc.). If she reaches the third stage and is still unmarried, she is no longer under her father's supervision: she may find her own husband (Manu IX.90; Vas.17.67-8; alternatively, Vis.Sm.24.40; see also the story of Savitrī in section V). Nagnikā and anagnikā belong to the first two stages. As the Gṛhasangraha (Gobhilaputra's appendix to the Gobhilagṛhyasūtra) explains, a girl is called nagnikā as long as she has not started menstruating (yāvan na ṛtumatī bhavet; ‘zu ergānzen: aber kurz davorsteht', 

 

[[88]]

Thieme); she is called anagnikā when she has begun menstruating (ṛtumatī; ‘zu ergānzen: aber erst seit kurzem', Thieme); one should therefore give one's daughter in marriage when she is anagnikā ('zu ergānzen: aber nicht schon eine prāptayauvana', Thieme 1971:175; Gṛhasangraha II.17). But as the age of marriage dropped from the teens to pre-teens-and even to the age of four (Br.P. 165.7) or five (Par.M.I.ii.p.77, Marīci)—the ideal of an anagnikā bride was replaced by that of a nagnikā. 

The pattern of later texts is the same. The ideal bride is not physically mature and sexually inexperienced but physically im- mature; a child still young enough to run around 'naked'. Accord- ing to Vas.XVII.70, for example, a father should give his daughter in marriage while she is still a nagnikā; if she remains at home after the onset of menstruation, he will incur the sin of a possible conception lost (cf. ṛtukāladharmāḥ, section IV, pp. 287-8). Accord- ing to Gaut.II.9.21–3, a girl should be given in marriage before she reaches puberty (prāg rtoh); according to some, before she wears any clothes (prāg vāsasah pratipatter). According to Sm.C.I.p.213, a girl is called nagnikā as long as she does not cover her body out of embarrassment (yavan na lajjayāngāni... avaguhet) when in the presence of men (puruṣasannidhau). Angāni (‘limbs') is glossed as yonyādiny ('private parts, etc.'). Alternatively, she is nagnikā as long as she need not wear an (upper) garment (yavac celam na gṛhṇāti), or as long as she does not menstruate (yavat ṛtudarśanam). When nakedness carries such associations, it is hardly surprising that a married woman, even when bathing, is not permitted to be naked. 

Getting dressed (vastradhāraṇam; Sdhp.7r.3–9) 

Tryambaka begins by quoting from the Matsyapurāṇa. ‘After bath- ing in this way, one should perform the ritual of sipping according to the rule, and then, rising up (from the sitting position), one should put on clean white clothes (vāsasī śukle suddhe).'67 Vāsasī, in the dual form, indicates both upper and lower garments. This, together with the requirement to wear white (śukle), clearly applies not to women but to men. For women, white is the colour of death,

worn by widows (Wood 1980:260; Rai and Singh 1983:84–5; Fuller and Logan 1985:89-92 etc.) and Jaina nuns (many of whom are also widows; Jaini 1979:246, note 8, 262-4, illus.27,28,30; but cf. Reynell 1985:26.4.2.iv). In his comments on widowhood, Tryambaka rules that the widow should not wear dyed garments (vikṛtam; glossed by Tryambaka as mañjiṣṭādir añjitam, ‘dyed with Indian madder, etc.'; Sdhp.46r.8) and then describes how the widowed daughters-in-law of Dhṛtarastra wear 'white garments' (suklottarīya, Sdhp.47[2]r.10 Mbh.XV.32.15; see section IV, pp. 299-300). The Mitākṣarā, however, glosses 'white' (śukle) as 'washed' (dhaute; Mit.on Yājñ.I.131). 

With regard to men, although the householder is usually enjoined to wear white garments (e.g. Manu IV.35; Yājñ.I.131), the Smṛti- candrikā quotes Bhṛgu (acc. to the Mysore edn.; Garga acc. to Gharpure) to the effect that while a brahmin should wear white, a kṣatriya should wear red or bright garments, a vaiśya yellow ones, and a sudra dark blue or dirty ones (nīlam malavat; Sm.C.II.p.298). Cloth died blue with indigo is invariably forbidden (e.g. Āp.Sm.VI. 4 ff.; Mit. on Yājñ.III.292; cf. Sdhp.20 v.10-21r.2). According to Uśanas, black is prohibited; according to Gautama, all dyed cloth is prohibited (Sm.C.II.p.298). But there are no recommenda- tions concerning the colours that a woman should or should not 

wear. 

Another significant difference between the rulings on dress for women and those for men is that only the latter refer to the sacred thread. For example, Ap.II.2.4.22-3 explains that the householder should always wear an upper garment (as well as a lower one); but if he is poor, he need only wear the sacred thread on his upper body. According to Vas.XII.14, the snataka must wear both upper and lower garments and two sacred threads. The rulings for women as explained by Tryambaka make no mention of the sacred thread for the obvious reason that women are now excluded from the upanayana, and the 'initiation' of marriage does not really count. 

Nor may we find any similarities between the rulings on dress for women and those recommended for the Vedic student (with whom married women are so often compared). For the emphasis in this context is on the material of which the garments are made. The lower garment of the brahmin student should be made of hemp, that of the ksatriya of flax, and that of the vaisya of wool, each dyed the appropriate colour. The upper garment should ideally consist of the skin of an animal: the black antelope, the spotted deer, and 

 

[[90]]

the goat or cow respectively (e.g. Manu II.41; Vas.XI.64–7; Āp.I. 2.39-1.3.10). What the staff, girdle and thread should be made of in the case of each twice-born varna is also discussed (e.g. Manu II.42 ff.). Evidently, none of this is of any relevance to the women of Tryambaka's day. 

Since Tryambaka's aim is to give general rules that are, in prin- ciple, applicable to both men and women, we must expect to gloss over the anomalies. His second quotation, from Uśanas, seems more straightforward. 'After taking one's bath, one should put on uncontaminated clothes (anupahatam vastram), according to the rule, '68 

The term anupahata (lit. 'undamaged') or, more commonly, ahata (lit. 'unbeaten') is interesting for, depending on the context, it may have a variety of related meanings. First, since clothes are 'beaten' in the Indian washing process, often with a stick, ahata may denote 'unbeaten' or ‘unwashed' and therefore dirty clothes. Thus Devala remarks that, when performing rituals, a man should wear cloth he has washed himself (svayam dhautena), not that washed by a washerman (nejakadhautena), and certainly never cloth that is 'unwashed' (ahatena; Sm.C.II.p.299). The second meaning is both more usual and more appropriate to Tryambaka's ruling. According to this interpretation, ahata may mean 'unwashed' in the sense of being unused and therefore perfect. The Smṛti- candrikā gives two definitions along these lines. In the āhnika section, ahata is said to denote brand-new cloth (yantranirmuktam, straight from the loom; Sm.C.II.p.299, Satyatapas). Such cloth should be worn on ritual occasions by the sacrificer and his wife (e.g. Śab. on Jai.X.4.13); it is also appropriate for auspicious rituals such as marriage (Sm.C.II.p.299). Alternatively-in a quotation attributed to Pulastya in the āhnika section (Sm.C.II. p. 298) and to Pracetas in the upanayana section (Sm.C.I.p.76) – the term denotes cloth that, although washed a little (īṣaddhautam), is still new and white, with its fringes still intact (sadaśam), unworn, and therefore ritually pure (sarvakarmāsu pāvanam). In the upanayana section, however, the term is applied exclusively to the dress of the (male) brahmin initiate (suklam ahatam vāso brāhmaṇasya; Sm.C.I.p.75). When applied by Tryambaka to the daily dress of all orthodox women, it must presumably be under- 

[^68]: ušanā snātvānupahatam vastram paridadhyād yathāvidhi // Sdhp.7r.5 (Usanas) < Sm.M.p.252 (Usanas). 

 

Before Dawn 

[[91]]

stood more loosely to denote garments that are in perfect condition, perfectly clean, and therefore ritually pure. 

A third possibility is that ahata denotes 'undamaged' cloth in the sense that it has never been 'cut' or 'stitched'; that is, the full woven length of the dhoti or sari as opposed to the cut cloth of the bodice or shirt. On these grounds, even today, men are required to remove their shirts before entering the inner sanctum of a temple. Similarly, in some south Indian temples even fifty or sixty years ago, women were required to enter without a blouse (Sanjukta Gupta: personal communication; cf. also Thapliyal 1979:59). This issue gains an added significance in the context of rulings related to whether or not a woman should wear a bodice (see below). 

Tryambaka then gives the most important modifying rules (vastradhāraṇe viseṣam) relating to women. He quotes Sarikha. '(A woman) should not show her navel; she should wear garments that extend to her ankles; and she should not expose her breasts.' 69 In section IV, this quotation, again attributed to Sankha, is repeated together with the ruling that she should not go outside without an upper garment (nānuktā gṛhan nirgacchen nanuttarīya...; Sdhp. 22r.9-22v. 1; see p.273). In his comments on widowhood, however, Tryambaka insists that the widow should not wear a bodice (Sdhp. 46r.7-8, section IV, p.299). In this context, therefore, the bodice is one of the marks of the woman whose husband is alive. 

A parallel to these rules on how a woman should wear her sari may be found in the rules concerning how a man should wear his dhoti. The latter should be tucked in at three points: near the navel, on the left side, and at the back. A brahmin who does this incorrectly is held to be a sūdra (Sm.M.II.p.351-3; Sm.C.II.p.300). However, both the purpose and the emphasis of the two sets of rules are quite different. A man is required to fold and tuck his garment in the 'right' way, presumably for otherworldly or 'unseen' (adrṣṭa) reasons; no mention is made of which parts of his body the garment is intended to conceal. But the rules for women give no guidance on how one should fold, wind and tuck the sari. This is especially surprising in view of the fact that there are a number of ways of

wearing the sari and that in Maharashtra (and thus presumably in this Maratha kingdom) the sakaccha style was held to be a mark of the upper classes, the vikaccha of the lower ones (cf. Altekar 1978:289-91; plates IV,V,VII). The rules concerning a woman's dress merely enjoin which parts of her anatomy she may not reveal: her breasts, her navel and her legs down to the ankle. This is obvious- ly another kind of ruling altogether. 

The first point to stress is that the prohibition on showing the ankles can only apply to the wealthier class of woman who is not required to work outdoors. Any visitor to India today will notice that women working in the fields or in the coastal fishing villages wear their saris hoisted well above their ankles so as not to impede their work. In this context, Tryambaka's ruling is a mark of social distinction as well as decorum. 

Is this also true of the ruling that a woman should not expose her breasts? Dharmasastra and nibandha literature are in agreement on this point: the breasts should be covered, either by a bodice or by the sari, or by an additional 'upper garment'. In the Gandhāra sculptures, certainly, the women appear fully covered. But how may we account for the many examples of bare-breasted women in the sculptures and paintings of southern and central India? 

Is it a matter of caste or class? If (as seems to be the case in the prohibition on showing the ankles) dharmaśāstra rulings apply only to the higher or wealthier varnas, then one would expect the semi-nude female figures to be of the lower orders such as maid- servants and dancing girls. But this is not so. In the paintings of Ajanta and the sculptures of Bharhut, for example, it is the court ladies and not the maid-servants who are without upper garments, even in public scenes. 

It is important to disentangle several related questions here. First, what is the role of the artist (silpin) in Indian society? Second- ly, what is the relationship between the artist and the specialist in religious law (dharmaśāstrin)? Finally, what may we deduce about the dress of court women in eighteenth-century Thanjavur? In a study of this nature, my answers will of necessity be brief.70 With regard to the first question, two artistic conventions seem to be operating at once. According to the realistic convention, the

artist portrays social dress and customs as he sees them around him. According to the supernatural convention, he presents my- thological figures as conceived by the tradition he espouses. The line between these two conventions is not always clearly drawn. Cōla bronzes, for example, tend to portray the dress of royalty of that period combined with traditional iconographic features (cf. Nagaswamy 1983:46-51, 165-70). Thus the ornaments, head- dress and lower garments worn by Parvati seem to reflect the former; the sacred thread presumably belongs to the latter (cf. Nagaswamy 1983:54, 144-5, 168; The Image of Man 1982:67; Ions 1967:92; Rowland 1970:328-9; etc.). 

But to which convention does her naked upper body belong? We do not deduce from Manet's 'Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe' either that it was the custom for high-class women to picnic naked amidst fully clothed men or that the lady in question is a courtesan. Do we need to assume from the paintings of Ajanta or the sculptures of Bharhut that women were in the habit of going around half- dressed? It is true that nudes in European art are usually restricted either to mythological characters (e.g. Venus, 'The Three Graces', 'The Judgement of Paris') or to private scenes of bathroom or bedroom (Clouet's 'Lady in the Bath', Manet's 'Olympia', Ingres' 'The Bather of Valpinçon' and 'Odalisque with Slave'). Indeed, Manet's 'Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe' caused an uproar when it was first shown, precisely because it depicted what was apparently a common public scene. It is perhaps surprising that there is no parallel condemnation of inappropriate semi-nudity in Sanskrit literature. But it has long been the custom in all Indian temple sculpture-Hindu, Buddhist and Jain-to use the half-naked and (according to Western standards of beauty) voluptuous female body as a decorative motif. In the realm of art, the female form is both exposed and extolled. 

It is clear that the second question regarding the relationship between dharmaśāstra and art is crucial here. Where there were no specific dharmasastric guidelines, the artist presumably reproduced what he saw around him. If such guidelines existed, however, it seems unlikely that he would deliberately go against them. On these grounds, therefore, we may suppose that the many representa- tions of women with naked breasts did not contravene the dharma- śăstra rulings current at the time. 

Judging by Tryambaka's statements, however, by the eighteenth 

 

[[94]]

century, they did. How may we explain this? The question may be approached in two ways: with reference to the different social customs prevalent in north and south India; and in relation to foreign, especially Muslim, influence. 

The Ajanta paintings show royal women with naked breasts while female servants wear blouses or dresses. If it was customary for high-class women in the cooler north to wear upper garments and those in the hot south not to, then was Tryambaka simply ruling that the women of the Thanjavur court should adopt the northern rather than the southern habit? Certainly, if women were expected to enter south Indian temples without a blouse (see ahata above), this was evidently considered proper female attire. But the issue is by no means clear. Hāla's Saptaśataka, for example, describes southern women wearing bodices (kancukī; IV.95, VII.20) or upper garments (dukūla; IV.69). The significance of the south Indian heat becomes evident in the Sahendravilāsa where the women of Šāhaji's court are described as being torn between wearing bodices for modesty's sake and removing them to keep cool (VII.78–9, 83). Perhaps the question of foreign influence is more relevant. The bodice (kañcuka, kūrpāsa(ka), colī) is listed among the 'foreign elements' in Thapliyal's book on the subject and she notes that upper class women were especially influenced by foreign fashions (1979:64-6). In particular, the importance of Muslim influence must be explored. For it is indisputable that as Muslim power and culture descended from the north of India, Islamic ideals of female modesty spread, especially among the ruling classes. Not sur- prisingly, the sculptures of Bharhut (Śunga period, 185-72 B.C.), Sanchi (Śunga, early Andhra, later Andhra, 185 B.C.-A.D. 320), Amaravati (especially later Andhra, 25 B.C.-A.D. 320) and Ellora (fifth to eighth centuries A.D.), and the paintings of Ajanta (first century B.C.-seventh century A.D.; Rowland 1970), long precede the invasion of Islam into the Deccan (A.D.1296) and its further descent into southern India (1310; see Leslie 1983(2): appendix B). 

It is more difficult to pinpoint the relative chronology of the Šankha ruling. Kane assigns the core of the Sankhadharmasūtra to the period 300 B.c.-A.d. 100 (PVK I.i.p.142), but this is not to say that the quotation given here is part of that early compilation. The question of chronology is especially difficult in relation to a text (or texts) known only from quotations. If we look at the works in which this particular ruling is cited, however, we may note that

[[95]]

all three predate the Muslim invasions of the south by at least a hundred years: the Mitākṣarā, 1100-1120 (PVK I.ii.871; 1120-5, Derrett 1973(1):50); Aparārka's commentary, 1125, Northern Konkaṇa (PVK I.ii. 2 80; 1115-30, Derrett 1973(1):50); and the Smṛticandrikā, the great authority in the south, 1150-1225 (PVK I.ii.286). 

But, whatever the relationship between female attire in the largely autonomous court of Thanjavur in the early eighteenth century and Islamic ideals, we may be sure that Tryambaka was a product of his time. Another product of the period is a collection of illustrations entitled Drawings of the Costumes of the Southern Peninsula of India by a Native of Tanjore, compiled in 1815 and depicting a man and a woman in each of several categories (David 1815). This shows that women of high status wore bodices (e.g. 'Rajapoot... Rajawar... Kharkana brahmin... Mogul.. priestess' etc.). A mid-way category shows women without bodices but covering their breasts with the loose end of the sari often worn in the sakaccha style (e.g. ‘oilmonger... brahmin?... Sathare . . . a kind of brahmin... Vishnu brahmin' etc.). Finally, women of low status leave the breasts uncovered altogether ('shoemaker. well-digger... conjurer... marava... washerman... weaver' etc.). Tryambaka is surely making a similar point. 

He also rules that ‘(a woman) should not dress herself and so on while her husband is watching.'71 The following two slokas are attributed to Vyasa. 'If her beloved (husband) is watching, she should neither anoint (her head) with oil, bathe, massage unguents (e.g. sandalwood paste; see plate 2) into her body, clean her teeth, arrange her hair, eat, vomit, sleep, dress, nor beautify herself in any way (prārambham maṇḍanānām). '72 The phrase prārambham maṇ- danānām covers clothes, ornaments, oils and so on. The last sloka is quoted again when Tryambaka deals with the proper behaviour of the wife when she is eating (see section IIC, p. 226, note 116). There is no parallel ruling that a man should not dress himself in the presence

of his wife; nor even a general rule that might be applied to both husband and wife. 

Wearing the tilaka mark (tilakadhāraṇam; Sdhp.7r.9–7 v.9) 

Tryambaka's next concern is to show that putting the auspicious tilaka mark on the forehead is a necessary part of the wife's toilette (plate 5). In doing so, he lists all the other things that indicate that a woman's husband is still alive; a description, in fact, of the suvāsinī (see pp. 84-5). The two ślokas, attributed here to Mārkaṇḍeya, are also to be found in Tryambaka's encyclopaedic commentary on the Rāmāyaṇa, the Dharmākūta; they are attributed there to Vyasa and are part of a lengthy comment on the tilaka metaphor given below. The same two ślokas are attributed to Aśvalayana in the section on general behaviour (Sdhp.22v.5-7; see section IV, pp. 273-4); and to the Skandapurāṇa as quoted in the Madanaratna in Sdhp.41r.5-7 (in an altered form to apply to the pregnant woman; see section IV, pp. 288–91). They read as follows. 

'The devoted wife (pativrata) who wishes her husband to live long should not neglect (duṣaye[1]; lit. "cause to be polluted") these things: haridra (i.e. haldi, yellow turmeric powder; put between the eyebrows and used as an unguent); collyrium (or lamp- black, for the eyes; plate 3); kunkuma (saffron or a reddish paste; to make the tilaka mark on the forehead; also used as an unguent); sindūra (saffron or a red powder; to mark the parting of the hair); the short-sleeved bodice; betel (to make the lips red and the breath fresh; a late idea, cf. PVK II.ii.p.734; cf. also Kām.I.4.16); the auspicious ornament (of marriage, mangalyabharaṇam; i.e. the mangalasūtra); and the adorning of ears, hands and carefully styled hair (i.e. with ornaments, flowers and so on; plate 4).'73

Haridra is the yellow substance with which deities are smeared, especially Gaṇeśa as Haridraganapati. It is believed to be a mark of good fortune, one that could ward off demons (Stutley 1977:110). It is also one of the signs that a woman is (once more) available to her husband for, as Tryambaka himself explains (section IV, pp. 286-7), she should anoint her body with unguents of haridrā and kunkuma after she has taken her ritual bath on the fourth day of menstruation. Collyrium, obtained by inverting a small earthen- ware dish over a sooty flame, is applied to the inner eyelid to outline the eyes and exaggerate their length. Since it makes a woman at- tractive, it is prohibited to the menstruating woman (section IV, pp.284-5), the woman whose husband is away (p.291), and the widow (pp.299-300). According to Meulenbeld (1974:438), two different substances are used: one for medicinal, the other for cosmetic purposes. Saffron was used originally for both kunkuma and sindūra, that is, for both the tilaka mark on the forehead and the red line in the hair parting; but nowadays a less expensive red powder or paste is used. The tilaka is usually a round dot, al- though this may vary according to family or caste tradition: the women of Vai in Maharashtra, for example, wear the tilaka as a horizontal red line. The sindūra is more commonly associated with north Indian women and is rarely found in Tamil Nadu today (cf. Fuller and Logan 1985:90). Both tilaka and sindūra indicate that a woman is married and her husband lives. For example, a Khajuraho inscription dated A.D. 953 describes how enemies were killed and their wives thereby deprived of the use of sindura (cf. Altekar 1978:301). 

As mentioned above (p.90), the short-sleeved bodice, worn under the sari by married women, is traditionally not worn by the widow (see section IV, p. 299). Betel, ornaments and flowers make a woman attractive: like collyrium, they should be avoided by the menstruating woman, the woman whose husband is away, and the widow (see section IV, pp. 284-5, 291, 299-300). Com- plicated hair-styles (e.g. Altekar 1978: plates VIII-XI; Nagaswamy 1983:46-51,158,165-70) are also prohibited to the widow either because her head is shaved, or her hair close-cropped, or alternative- ly because she must wear it in a simple bun (see section IV, pp. 299– 300, 303-4). The menstruating woman, on the other hand, should not comb her hair (see p. 284). 

 

[[98]]

The mangalasūtra, the auspicious thread on which beads (usually black or gold) are strung, is fastened around the neck of the bride by the groom during the marriage ceremony (cf. PVK II.i.537). Chapter XV of the Laghvāśvalayanasmṛti describes the sacrament of marriage in detail and provides the earliest reference to the marriage thread (mangalyatantu, v.33; Dh.kośa III.iii.p.2048). Mantras are recited to ensure the wife's fidelity to her husband and Gauri bestows saubhagya on the bride. Saubhagya originally and literally meant 'good fortune' or 'prosperity', but it came to have as its established meaning (virūḍhalakṣaṇā) the good fortune of the happily married woman whose husband is alive. The prefix sau, with which the married woman is addressed, stands for saubha- gyavati, meaning 'fortunate woman' (i.e. by virtue of her marriage; Baudh.gr.1.6.30). The mangalasūtra, the tilaka, and the red line of sindura in the hair, are all indispensable signs of the married woman whose husband is alive; as long as he lives, they must be 

worn. 

Both the famous tilaka metaphor from the Rāmāyaṇa and Tryambaka's comment on it are taken from his own work. As he himself explains, 'that is why (wearing the tilaka is specified) in the Dharmākūta (commentary) written by me on the Rāmā- yana.'74 He begins by quoting Răm. III.8. 'When the sun resolutely remains in the direction frequented by Death (Yama; thus the south), then the northern direction like a woman without her tilaka does not shine.'75 The Dharmākūta explains. "The lady, in the form of the northern direction, whose husband-husband of the directions, jewel of the day (the sun)-has gone to the south (has died) is described as not wearing the tilaka. Therefore the lack of tilaka and so on is the defining mark of the widow (vidhavāyā lakṣaṇam). (Correspondingly), wearing the tilaka and so on is the defining mark of the woman whose husband is alive (suvā- sinīnām lakṣaṇam).'76 The image is drawn from the division of

the year into two parts: dakṣināyana, when the sun ‘abides in' (or, more accurately, when the ecliptic tends towards) the south, during which time the days become shorter and the nights longer; and the uttarāyaṇa, when the sun 'abides in' the north and the days become longer once more. In dakṣināyana, the sun sets in a more southerly direction, leaving the northern sky dark. At such times, the northern direction, bereft of the sun's rays, does not 'shine'. Similarly, a wife whose husband has died is bereft of the tilaka mark that radiates her good fortune and so she too, as it were, no longer shines. 

In order to put these rulings concerning the tilaka for women into perspective, let us consider the equivalent rulings for men. In the Viramitrodaya (Vīr.Ā.p.248-52) and in the Smṛtimuktā- phala (Sm.M.II,p.292–310), for example, elaborate rules are laid down for the marks to be made on a man's forehead after his bath. Whether called tilaka or pundra(ka), these are evidently sectarian marks intended to indicate the religious persuasion of the wearer. The urdhvapundra or urdhvatilaka (a vertical mark of one or more lines) indicates the follower of Visnu; the tripundra (three horizontal lines) that of Śiva. According to the Smrticandrikā, the urdhva- pundra may be made with earth taken from a selection of sacred spots such as the top of a mountain or the bank of a sacred river. There are rulings on how the mark should be made (with which fingers, etc.), what it should look like, and on which twelve parts of the body it should be placed (on the forehead, chest, throat, arms, etc.; Sm. C.II.pp.302 ff.; Vṛddhahārītasmṛti II.58-72). Sankh.gr.II.10.6 gives the five parts of the body that should be marked with the tripundra in sacred ash. Elsewhere, we read that the urdhvapundra is made with earth after one's bath; the tripundra with sacred ash after performing homa; the (circular) tilaka in sandalwood paste after worshipping the gods (devapūjā; PVK II.i.p.673). There are even rulings on the size and shape of the tilaka or puṇḍra according to a man's varna : like a bamboo leaf for a brahmin; like a fish for a kṣatriya: smaller still for a vaiśya; and like a half-moon for a sūdra (Vīramitrodaya on Yājñ.1.20-21; Gharpure 1936). 

Tryambaka's section on the tilaka for women explains none of this. The sectarian marks so important to men are deemed irrelevant to their wives. In the next quotation from Vasistha (see below), there is a brief reference to the pundraka or sectarian mark; but that is all. The remaining references to the tilaka have no relation 

 

[[100]]

to either Visnu or Śiva. The mark is made with neither sacred earth, sacred ash, nor sandalwood paste, but with kunkuma, the sign of a woman's marital happiness or saubhagya. For the tilaka is the visible symbol of a woman's religious allegiance as distinct from that of men. It declares first that her husband is her deity; secondly, that he is still alive to receive her daily service and worship. As we have seen, the bulk of the rulings on a woman's appearance carry the same message: her husband lives; all religious devotion must be directed to him alone. A man without his sectarian mark is a man without a god; a woman without her tilaka is one whose god is dead. 

The next four slokas are also taken from the Dharmākūta; in both texts, they are attributed to the Vasiṣṭhasamhitā. “The short bodice (kañcuki), the marriage necklace (kanthasūtram), a pair of earrings, collyrium, glass bangles, anointing with turmeric (haridrā) and putting the sectarian mark (pundraka) on the forehead, arrang- ing the hair, wearing ornaments on one's feet and nose, betel and so on-all these are declared to be the marks of women who have been blessed with good fortune (punyayoṣitām; i.e. they are not widows). If a woman wears glass ornaments at wrist and throat, her behaviour is meritorious; and her cooking is said to be pure.' 77 'If she does not wear glass ornaments at wrist and throat, she is understood to be a widow (i.e. in this life) and (she will also become a widow) in life after life.'78 

Glass bangles (a late development; cf. Altekar 1978:298) are another indispensable sign of the married woman whose husband is alive. When he dies, she breaks them (e.g. Wood 1980:172; Jameson 1976:251; etc.). The ritual purity of a woman's cooking is important for eating itself; for the ritual of eating (see Parāskara's Bhojanasūtra, traditionally learned by heart and followed to the

letter by young initiates; LSJ); and for the ritual of offering food to the deity. The cooking of a high-caste married woman whose husband is living is pure. If she is menstruating, however, it is not; hence the prohibition (see section IV, p. 284). In the case of a widow, in Maharashtra as in other parts of India, if she shaves her head, her cooking is deemed pure; if she does not, it is un- acceptable (LSJ). To say that a woman wears glass bangles and necklace is thus to say that her husband is alive; that in turn is a mark of her virtue and purity; hence her cooking is pure. 

Nose- and toe-rings seem to be another late development. Altekar notes the conspicuous absence of the nose-ring in sculpture and painting throughout India before the Muslim invasions. He concludes that it was originally a Muslim ornament (1978:301 ff.; cf. PVK II.i.537). By the time of Tryambaka, however, it was another indispensable sign of saubhagya. 

To conclude, the rules on dress for a man classify him in religious terms. The sacred thread is a mark of the twice-born, one who has undergone initiation followed by years of religious education. The colours of his garments and the way they are worn show his varna. The symbols on his forehead mark his sectarian allegiance. These are the signs of the religious status of a man, his reward for merit accumulated in past lives, and so now his innate virtue and purity. Similarly, the rules on dress for a woman classify her in religious terms, but in a markedly different way. That she is a woman is itself a demerit earned in a previous life (see section III, pp. 246– 72). All the rulings on dress, however, imply compensatory merits. Her entire appearance, from the flowers in her hair to the rings on her toes, signify that her personal deity is alive. That in itself is proof of her religious virtue, her ritual purity and thus of her authority in the home.
