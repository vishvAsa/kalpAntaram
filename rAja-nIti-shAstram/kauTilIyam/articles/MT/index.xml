      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1604005780482424832.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Certain white indologists have interpreted the structural similarity between the kauTilIya arthashAstra &amp;amp; the kAmasUtra as evidence for the latter being modeled after the former. They also want to see both as gupta era texts. We see that as a tenuous claim. While both texts were redacted multiple times after their original composition, their core material is essentially that of their original composers. We believe they simply represent text lying at the junction of the older sutra &amp;amp; new classical era.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unrollthread.com/t/1603643482446471174/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kharoShThI arthashAstra digest manuscript collected in TSP by Nassim Khan &amp;amp; described by Strauch with possible relationship to the chAkShushIya arthashAstra indicates how the tradition might have been transmitted to central Asia by the kuShANa-s; the said document was likely composed in the kuShAna empire &amp;amp; buried at an old shrine/college in what&amp;rsquo;s today &amp;ldquo;Khyber Pakhtunkhwa&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, we should mention that the central Asia connection was already there even in the kauTilIya text which mentions sAmUra pelts &amp;ndash; sable pelt (?) which steppe Iranians use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
