      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of Kautilya&amp;rsquo;s work were present in 11thC Spain: The andalusian jurist al-Turtushi refers to one Muntakhab-ul-Jawahir as guide for Kings, composed by one Shanaq, undoubedly Kautilya; and also refers to his Canakya-Niti by the name Kitab Shanaq fi al-Tadbir.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A very comprehensive Arabic Mirror for Princes entitled Siraj-ul-Mulk was compiled in 1122 by Abu Bakr Muhammad bin al-Walid al-Turtushi (1059– 1127), who was born in Spain and had visited Iran and Iraq. Here he met the Seljuq vizier Nizam-ul-Mulk Tusi (1018-92) and was greatly impressed by Tusi&amp;rsquo;s scholarship and political acumen. Even the earlier Mirror for Princes had drawn upon stories in Kalila wa Dimna, as translated from Pahlavi (old Persian) by Ibn-ul-Muqaffa (died 756). Turtushi&amp;rsquo;s work also shows a definite debt to the same source, Kalila wa Dimna. He also refers to Muntakhab-ul-Jawahir (Selected Gems) composed by the Indian Shanaq (Chanakya) as a guide for the monarch. This text, the Kitab Shanaq fi al-Tadbir, was in fact the celebrated Chanakya- Niti, a collection of political aphorisms in Sanskrit, not to be confused with the Arthashastra ascribed to Kautilya or Chanakya”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
