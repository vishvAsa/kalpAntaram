It is likely a layered text and some form of the text must've existed by the 2nd century AD (as evidenced by the Spitzer Manuscript), but the core text likely dates to the Śuṅga period.
Modern scholars have largely "discontinued any presumed connection between the Arthaśāstra and the Mauryan period."

## Not mauryan
The Arthaśāstra is most-likely NOT a Mauryan era text.
The terminus post quem for its composition is the Śuṅga era.
The author of the Arthaśāstra is familiar with silk, knows of settlements beyond Puṇḍravardhana like Suvarṇakuḍya (Sonkuriha in Assam, "sauvarṇakuḍyakaṃ raktapītaṃ mātuluṅgagandhi") as well as a type of nutmeg (or jasmine?)-colored incense from beyond the Brahmaputra (bhadraśriyaṃ pāralauhityakaṃ jātīvarṇam).
Excavations at Ambari date back to the Śuṅga period, not the Mauryan period.
The author also knows of coral from Roman Alexandria or "Ālakanda" (pravālakam ālakandakaṃ vaivarṇikaṃ ca raktaṃ padmarāgaṃ ca karaṭagarbhiṇikāvarjam iti).
Direct sea trade between the Roman Egypt (centered on Alexandria) and peninsular India began only after Hippalus discovered the monsoon winds around ~100-50 BCE.
This is around the same time that Roman Red Sea ports (e.g. Berenike, Myos Hormos) emerge.

## Sātavāhana
This doesn't imply that the text must've been composed during the Śuṅga period.
I personally find it more likely to have been composed in Sātavāhana-era Deccan.
However, the combination of internal evidence suggests it likely wasn't composed prior to the Śuṅga period.

The Arthaśāstra and Manusmṛti are clearly linked.
Some have proposed that the Manusmṛti draws upon the earlier prakaraṇa core of the Arthaśāstra, but it's more likely that the Arthaśāstra draws upon the Manusmṛti.

It's clear that later redactors sought to portray the text as early Mauryan era composition, given the interpolated verse:

> yena śāstraṃ ca śastraṃ ca Nanda-rāja-gatā ca bhūḥ।  
amarṣeṇoddhṛtāny āśu tena śāstram idaṃ kṛtam॥


## chANakya kauTiklya viShNugupta
> Imo, Canakya likely existed (beyond his literary image) and was a Mauryan bureaucrat, the core of the AS was composed by a Sungan (this is Kautilya), with a major redaction during the Satavahana age by another author and some minor additions were done till the Gupta age. I believe that the Gupta-s may have possibly overseen an attempt to equate Kautilya and Canakya as a single figure to tie themselves to the Mauryans and use them to establish their own legitimacy. - akShayaH

It is quite likely that  "Cāṇakya" is the composite of two or three different figures.

Cāṇakya was likely the advisor of Candragupta whereas Kauṭilya/Kauṭalya/Viṣṇugupta likely lived a few centuries later and was the composer of the Arthaśāstra.

The Arthaśāstra describes a post-Śuṅga society and both "svayam eva Viṣṇuguptaś cakāra sūtraṃ ca bhāṣyaṃ ca" and "yena śāstraṃ ca śastraṃ ca Nandarājagatā ca bhūḥ..." are spurious interpolations, though it seems reasonable that Viṣṇugupta was the personal name of Kauṭilya, as Kauṭilya resembles a title or gotra name rather than a personal name.

On the other hand, Candragupta's advisor Cāṇakya cannot have been the author of Arthaśāstra, as scholars like McClish have established (the core of the Arthaśāstra is pre-Gupta but post-Śuṅga, likely dating to the Sātavāhana period).

Some believe even Kauṭilya and Viṣṇugupta are two separate individuals. I agree with Jacobi that the problem will likely remain unsolved.
