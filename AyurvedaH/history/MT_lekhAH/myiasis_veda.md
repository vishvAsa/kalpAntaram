Knowledge of agents of myiasis in the Chandogya (1) and taittirIya (2) traditions coming from our ancestor jamadagni among others:

> 1. kṛmim indrasya bāhubhyām avāñcaṃ pātayāmasi | hatāḥ kṛmayaḥ sāśātikāḥ sa-nīlamakṣikāḥ ||

> We hurl down the worm with the arms of Indra. Slain are the worms with the cattle bots (Āśātika-s) and the blue bottle flies (Nīlamakṣika-s).

> 2. āśātikāḥ krimaya iva । tataḥ pūyante vāsavaiḥ । apaitaṃ mṛtyuṃ jayati ।

> The Āśātika-s are like worms, i.e., The myiasis-causing larvae.

Remarkably, the word persists in marAThI as AsADI.
