CHAPTER XXXII 

SADACARA 

CUSTOMS AND MODERN CUSTOMARY LAW1606 

From Gautama 1606 downwards many writers dilate upon the sources of dharma. Gautama. I. 1-2 states: ' the Veda is the source ( mula) of dharma and also the tradition (or smṛtis ) and practice of those who know the Veda'. Similarly Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 1.1-%) says: 'we shall propound the acts (that produce merit) which are evolved from conventions and practices; the authority ( for finding out the dharmas) are the conventions of those who know the dharma and the Vedas'. Vas. I. 4-7 pro vides: 'dharma is declared by the Vedas and Smptis; on failure of these two the practice of the sistas is the authority (for finding out what dharma is); a sista however is one whose heart is free from (worldly ) desires and (only ) such acts of sigtas are ( to be held as ) dharma for which no ( worldly

or secular ) cause (or motive) can be assigned'. 1607 Manu II. 6 and Yaj. I. 7 declare that Veda (or sruti), smrti and the practices of the good are the principal sources of dharma. The words employed in these works are fila, samaya, ācāra or sadācāra or sistācāra 1607 (the latter three meaning the game thing ). Ap. employs both words viz. samaya and ācāra, the first of which probably means 'agreement or convention or usage', while the latter means 'custom'. The word 'custom' now conveys the idea of some antiquity, 1608 while usage or convention does not necessarily convey that idea. A usage may be recent or it may be established by agreement among a certain class of persons ( such as traders or craftsmen ). We have to see what is meant when it is said that ācāra or śiṣṭācāra or sadācāra is the source (mūla) of dharma. An indication of the meaning is furnished by the word pramīna employed by Ap. and Vas. The meaning is that just as the revealed books (Veda) and the smrtis authoritatively lay down what dharma is, so also in our quest to find out what dharma is in the varying circumstances of life the practices of those who may be called sistas furnish us with the necessary criterion or norm i. e. $iṣtācāra is the touchstone for judging whether an act is in consonance with what the Śāstras require us to do. The theory of the ancient writers was that the smrtis were based on parts of Veda ( that consists of mantras and Brāhmaṇa texts ) which though formerly existent are not now extant or available, that similarly the practices of those who were learned in the Vedas and were deemed to be śistas must be inferred to have been based on portions of Veda not now available. This theory was advanced by such ancient 

1607. As to the qualifications of sistas, vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 971– 72 wbere references are given to Baud. Dh. S., Mapu, the Matsyapurāṇa and a few other works. The Tai. Up. I.: 11 contains perhaps the oldest extant indication as to who should be regarded as sistas, though that word itself is not used.

writers as Āp. 1609 and was taken up by many subsequent works. Manu II. 7 also states that whatever dharma has been ordained for any person by Manu, all that has been entirely declared in the Veda for the Veda is full of all knowledge. But it does not follow from this nor is it ever meant that all practices of bistas are authoritative in matters of dharma. The qualifica tion was added that where the practices of sistas are clearly referable to or are prompted by a seen motive or by the desire to secure pleasure, there they are not authoritative. Manu (II. 18 ) restricted the word sadācāra to the customs handed down from generation to generation among the four varṇas and the mixed castes in the country called by him Brahmā varta ( II. 17). But many other writers did not so restrict it in this way, 

We have to distinguish between what are called the sources (mūla or pramāṇa ) of dharma and the sthānas of dharma (Yaj. I 3 and 7), 1610 The former indicate to the inquiring spirit what dharma is (i.e. they are what are called jñāpaka hetu ), while the latter must be studied as aids by the expounders of dharma in order to correctly grasp what dharma is, i.e. the different lores (other than Veda and smrti ) are not directly the sources of dharma, but are only mediately so. This distinc tion is an ancient one as even Gautama XI. 19 provides that the king is helped in his administration of justice by the Veda, the dharmaśāstras, the auxiliary lores ( angas), the Upavedas and the Purāṇa. 1611 

The position of the Purvamsmāmgā in relation to the authoritativeness of smrtis and customs requires careful and

detailed consideration. In I. 3. 1-2 1612 Jaimini considers the question whether such smrti injunctions as one should perform the Astaka sraddhas',1613 or 'one should construct a tank or set up a prapā (place for free distribution of water to thirsty travellers'), or 'tufts of hair should be kept on the head' (at caula according to the gotra ) are authoritative and establishes the conclusion that they are authoritative, since such smrti injunctions equally with Vedic ones are addressed to the same persons (viz. the followers of the Veda ) who have to act according to them. The idea is that those who perform the acts expressly enjoined by the Veda are also seen to perform the acts enjoined by such smrtis as that of Manu and therefore the principal reason why these smṛtis are authoritative is the fact that those who know the Veda accept these smrtis as authorita tive and hold fast by them, as Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 says citing some verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka. 1614 Sabara endeavours to show that there are indications (linga) in the Vedic texts pointing to the existence of what is prescribed in the smrtis e.g. he cites the Vedic verse 'yam janah' as indicative 

1612. धर्मस्य शब्दमूलत्वादशब्दमनपेक्षं स्यात् । अपि वा कर्तृसामान्यात्प्रमाणमनु मामं स्यात् । जै. I. 3. 1-2 The word अनुमान is here used in the sense of स्मति. 'भपिया पक्षो ज्यावय॑ते । प्रमाणं हि स्मृतिः । ... अन्धस्स्वनुमीयेत कर्वसामान्यास्मृति वैदिकपदार्थयोः । तेनोपपलो वेदसंयोगस्वर्णिकानाम् ।' शबर; about अष्टका he says 'अष्टकालिङ्गाश्च मन्त्रा दे हश्यन्ते यो जनाः प्रतिनन्दन्तीत्येवमादयः ।।. That verse is, यो जनाः प्रतिनन्दन्ति रात्रि धेनुमिवायतीम् । संवत्सरस्य या पत्नी सा नो अस्तु सुमडाली। This occurs in आप. म. पा. II. 10. 27, in पारस्करगृह्य III. 2 and in अथर्ववेद III. 10. 2 where we have या देवा: etc. Acc. to प्रभाकर the topic of Jai. I. 3. 1-2 is not such smrti texts as those on Aṣtakā, but the Vedic verse at wat: itself. The न्यायसुधा p. 126 adds 'अटाकायै सुराधसे स्वाहेति तस्याटकादेवतारात्रिप्रकाश. कत्वादेषा बै संवत्सरस्य पत्नी पदष्टकेति संवत्सरपत्नीत्वसंस्तुताष्टकाप्रकाशकत्वाशाष्टका लिङ्गवं स्पष्टमेवेति'. The word कतसामान्यात in the sutra is explained in the मयूखमालिका as 'अग्निहोत्रादीनां वैदिकपदार्थानां ये कारस्त एव अटकादिरसतीनामिति कर्वसामान्यात्मामाण्यमुक्तम् । (on जै. I. 3. 4 p. 21): while the न्यायसुधा (p. 125) proposes also another explanation ' यद्वा स्मृतिकतणां मन्यादीनां वैदिकपदार्थकता तदानींतनानी शिष्टानां त्रैवर्णिकत्वेन समानस्वात् इदानींतनधमन्यादीनामप्युपएलो वेद संयोग इत्यधः .

Authoritativeness of smrtis

of astakās, Rg. X. 4. 1 of prapas, Rg. VI. 75. 17 of tufts of hair. The objection may be stated as follows The smrtis are composed by human authors (i. e. they are pauruṣeya ) and so have no independent authority in matters of dharma, as a man may say what is either false or mistaken. If it be said that the smṛtis really propound what is stated by the Veda, then they are practically superfluous and useless. and not being Veda they should be discarded (anapeksa ) To this the reply is that smṛtis are generally authoritative, as they must be held to be based on Veda because they are composed by men (like Manu ) who were followers of the Veda, because what the smrtis lay down has been consistently followed from generation to generation by the sistas and because it is possible to regard the Veda as their source. To the question why the Vedic passages on which the smrti rules are postulated to have been based are not seen or found by us several answers were proposed by different writers. One view was that just as Vedic indications about locks of hair lead to the inference of śruti texts enjoining the keeping of tufts on the head, so the fact of the existence of such rules leads to the inference that śruti must have contained injunctions corres ponding to all smrti prescriptions. Kumārila raises objections to this view. Inference is based on perception (pratyakṣa ) and invariable concomitance (vyāpti). There is no vyāpti between the smṛtis and śruti texts that are never found pro nounced by any one, so no inference is possible and it would be like one blind man following another.1615 Manu must have composed his smṛti on finding that ācāryas preceding him performed certain acts as based on Veda. These last must have believed that their predecessors also acted on the same belief, Hence there is what is called an 'andha-paramparā' on this hypothesis. And further this hypothesis of the inference of Sruti in all cases is opposed to perception, since as a matter of fact hundreds of Śruti passages are known that can be the basis of corresponding smrti texts. Another view is (and Kumārila holds that it is somewhat better than the preceding view ) that one should infer that the Vedic passages that were the basis of smptis are lost ( utsanna or pralīna). Some support is lent to this by such Vedic texts as ' anantā vai vedah' (Tai. Br. III 10. 

1615. तत्वयुसमन्धपरम्पराग्यायादेव। या हि चोदना न कदाचिदुरचार्यते तस्याः सर्वपुरुषप्रत्यक्षादिप्रसराभावाद दुर्लभतरमस्तिलम् । ... लिहावीमा हमित्यवालिस्यमवरच. Rage ATATTHA

[Vol. 

11)and by Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 10. Even this view is not acceptable to the Tantravārtika and most of the Mīmāṁsakas. The objection against the 2nd view is raised as follows. Even Bauddhas and other heretical sects 1616 would advance the argument that their works also are based on śruti texts that are now lost, and any one may regard anything as authoritative by pretending that the basic vedic texts are lost. Further the Mimāṁsā view that the Veda is eternal ( nitya ) would be refuted if it were admitted that some portion of the Veda is lost. There is not much difference between the first view and the second view. Therefore Kumārila propounds the third view viz. that smṛtis are to be inferred as based on Vedic texts that are already in existence 1617. If an objection is raised against this hypothesis that it must be explained why such Vedic texts ( the bases of smrtis ) are not seen or found, the Tantravārtika replies in a famous kārikā that as the Vedic śākhās (the several branches of the Veda) are scattered about (in various countries), as men (followers of the Veda) are negligent and unmindful (i.e. they do not visit all the countries and so are unable to have a complete knowledge of all Vedic texts ) and as several rules are declared in different contexts even when occurring in the same śākhā (and not at one place ) it is not always possible to point out the Vedic sources of smrti texts. If an objector were to ask : 'why were not the Vedic passages themselves (that are the sources of smrti rules ) embodied bodily into the smrtis,' Kumārila replies that this was not done from the fear of the loss of the correct arrangement of the Vedic texts as traditionally handed down. The Veda is principally concerned

with sacrifices, though now and then there are rules addressed to men for regulating conduct only. People would only study the Vedic sentences contained in the smṛtis ( that are concerned principally with conduct) where they would be arranged in a different order according to subjects and there would thus be loss of the arrangement of the Veda as originally delivered. Viśvarupa 1618 (on Yaj. I. 7) quotes the above verse of Kumarila and states that there are thousands of smrti rules that have their source in the Veda; he and Kumarila instance tha rules against talking with (or coming in contact with ) a woman in her monthly illness or the rule against assaulting a brāhmaṇa, or the rule about the sin of killing an ātreyi woman &c. Medhātithi on Manu II. 6 has an elaborate discussion on this very topic and quotes several verses from his own work called Smrtiviveka 1619. He does not approve of the first two views and follows Kumārila's view. Mimāmgā writers and commentators like Medhātithi say that Manu and other authors of smstis brought together for easy comprehension matters that are scattered about in the various Vedic texts, that are either not known to the students of the several śākhās or that cannot be brought together by men of ordinary or weak intellect, 16194 

The general proposition that sniștis are authoritative being established, a further question arises. What is to happen if a empti rule conflicts with the rule of the Veda? Jaimini deals

with this question in I. 3. 3-4, 1620 which form a topic that states an exception to the general rule contained in Jai. 1.3.1-2. Sabara gives three instances where there is apparently a conflict between the prescriptions of the śruti and those of smṛtis. The Veda says, 'the priest should chant (the slotra) after touching the audumbari post', while smrti says 'the whole of the audum bart post should be covered with cloth'. The Veda says 'one to whom a gon has been born and whose hair is still dark (and has not turned grey ) should consecrate the Vedic fires', while smrti says 'a man should observe Vedic studenthood for 48 years' 1621 ; the Veda says 'when the Agniṣoiniya rite is finished then one may eat (the food prepared) in the house of the sacrificer, while smṛti says 'the food of one who has undergone dikṣā for a sacrifice may be eaten after he purchases the soma plant'. In these cases the proposition enunciated by Jaimini is that in case of conflict ( between an express sruti rule and a smrti rule) the smrti rule should be discarded, for when there is no conflict ( with an express sruti) inference may be made ( that a smrti rule is based upon some Vedic text).' The examples may be explained as follows: The 'audumbari' is a post of udumbara planted in the sudas in the performance of the Agnistoma ; the stotras (other than Bahispavamāna) are chanted near the audumbari post in the sadas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1155 for the fixing of the audumbara post in the sadas and p. 1185 for the chanting of stotras near the audumbari. If the whole of the post be covered with cloth, it would not be possible to touch the post, but only the cloth would be touched. So there is contra diction. If a man is to consecrate Vedic fires when he has a son and his hair is dark, he must be between about 20 and 40 (i. e. a young man), but if a man were to observe brahmacarya for

Conflict between sruti and smrti

48 years, he would be about 52 to 56 years of age before he married ( as the upanayana of a brāhmaṇa was to be performed generally in the 8th year or from the 5th year onwards at the most). Only a married man could consecrate Vedic fires. But a man's hair when he is fiftytwo years of age or more can hardly be all dark. Therefore there is contradiction between the rule derived from the Veda and that derived from smrti. In the Jyotiptoma (which generally occupied five days), the dikṣā (purification and initiation of the sacrificer) takes place on the first day in the afternoon (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1134-1136 ). Soma is purchased on the 2nd day of the Jyoti stoma (ibid. 1140–4 ) and the animal is sacrificed for Agni and Soma on the 4th day (ibid. pp. 1158-59). According to śruti therefore the food prepared in the house of a diksita may be eaten only after the 4th day, while smrti says that it may be eaten after the purchase of soma on the 2nd day. In this way there is contradiction. Kumārila 1622 does not agree with Sabara as regards these examples in particular and as regards the general attitude towards smstis that are accepted by Vedic followers. He makes great efforts to explain how there is no real conflict in the cases cited by Sabara. As regards the cloth covering the audumbari he says that it may cover the bottom and the upper portion of the post and leave a space of two or three finger-breadths in the middle uncovered ( so that the audumbari post can be touched in that particular por tion), that (p. 188 ) there is a passage in the Sātyāyani 

1622. The sūtra (Jai. 1. 3, 3 ) is read as n or water and with both readings it has been explained in different ways from ancient times.

Brahmana which refers to the cloth covering the audumbari (and so there may at most be an option), that as regards the taking of food in the house of a dikṣita after the purchase of soma there is a śruti passage in the Atharvavoda (pp. 181 and 189 ) similar to the smrti passage ( and thus there is no conflict between śruti and smrti, but between śruti and śruti, which would lead to an option) and further the smrti rule may apply in the case of a man in distress (ūpad dluermu), that smrti does not prescribe an absolute period of 48 years for the study of Veda, but Baud. Dh. S. itself allows several alternative or optional periods and so no question of conflict with śruti arises. Kumārila's own position is this: In the case of apparent conflicts between sruti and smṛti, various methods of interpretation and reconciliation are possible. Each of the two may be given its proper scope as referring to different subject matters ( which is called viṣayız-vyavasthā); it is also possible to hold that smrti is based on some sruti texts already existing but not found at the time of discussion, but which may ultimately be found, in which case there will be an option, though the latter is to be avoided as far as possible as it is liable to eight faults (vide Tantravārtika pp. 174-175 ); or the two may be reconciled even when referring to the same subject matter e. g. a man may have dark hair even when he is 52 or more and the smști may be taken as meant to refer to such a man, while the sruti states the general rule about the age when consecration of Vedic fires was to be made. Therefore Kumārila holds that all that is meant by Jaimnini and even by Sabara is that there is a great distinction between sruti and smrti in that the former is apauruṣeya and an independent authority, while the latter has a human author (liable to err ), is either actually based on the Veda or is inferred to be so based, that the two therefore can never be said to be quite alike each other as regards their authoritativeness and that lastly smrti is not in itself to be regarded as unauthoritative 1623. Kumārila therefore suggests that the proper subject of discussion in Jai. I. 3. 3-4 is the works of Bauddhas, Saṅkhya, Yoga, Pañcarātra, Pāśupata and other heretical sects and the practices of mlecchas. These works contain some matters such as the emphasis on ahimsā, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and compassion, which are also emphasized in the Veda, but those works are not

Worlds of heretical sects

generally accepted by the followers of the Veda, are based on specious and false reasoning only (they are haitukas in the words of Manu), that they deny the authority of the Veda. Therefore Jaimini means that these works of heretic sects are not authoritative in matters of dharma as they are opposed to the Veda and should be discarded. For want of space it is not possible to set out in detail the interesting discussion in the Tantravārtika. The Jaiminiya-nyāya-mālāvistāra also gives another explanation of Jai. I. 3. 3. 

Sabara (on Jai. I. 3. 4) explains that the three smrti passages stated above are not authoritative since it is possible to point out how they originated in a visible worldly motive such as greed. When a visible motive can be pointed out for any smrti text, it is not proper to infer that it is based on the Veda and has an unseen spiritual motive. Sabara 1624 postulates the reasons in the way of a modern man finding fault with priests, Some priests covered the whole of the Auduinbari post with cloth, because they coveted the cloth as part of the fee; others who desired a free meal when hungry took food at the house of a dikṣita even after he had purchased the Soma plant; certain others in order to conceal their absence of virility went in for Veda study for 48 years. The Tantravārtika tries to show that in all these cases there is really no visible motive such as covetousness ( pp. 188-189 ). 

Sabara gives an alternative explanation of this sutra (Jai. 1.3.4) and makes a separate topic (adhikarana) of it. The reasong 1625 for giving an alternative explanation of a sūlra or adhikarana are two, viz. dissatisfaction with the explanation already given or the wide scope of the subject under discussion. In 1. 3.3 passages from smrtis were cited which were apparently in conflict with śruti. If they were really in conflict, that one reason alone is more than sufficient to render the smṛtis invalid. Therefore to say further that those snirti passages originate in worldly motives like greed does not add any very substantial reason for the abandonment of smrtis as authoritative. There fore Sabara makes another adhikarapa of sutra 4 of Jai. 1. 3.

He cites gmpti passages which are not opposed to Veda at all and says that such passages have seen a worldly motive such as convetousness and it is not proper to suppose that they are based on Veda and are therefore authoritative, when a visible purpose or motive can be ascribed to them. The result of the explanations of I. 3. 3-4 given by Sabara would be that smrti rules that are opposed to śruti rules and smrti prescriptions that can be shown to have a clear worldly motive are not authoritative or absolutely binding, while the rest of smsti texts are authoritative. 1628 

Sabara cites on Jai. I. 3. 4 (when taken as a separate topic ) 16264 two examples; (1) the adhvaryu priest takes ( as his fee ) the cloth used in the Vaisarjana homa; (2) they perform the gift of the elephant ( i. a. the cloth covering) of the sacrificial post. Sabara says that these passages are not opposed to any śruti text but instead of inferring a Vedic text as their basis it is far better to hold that there is a manifest worldly motive for these rules ( viz. covetousness of the adhvaryu ) and so these smrti passages need not be looked upon as authorita tive. 1627 

This discussion raises an important doctrine which frequ ently figures in dharmaśāstra works. The doctrine is expressed

Rules having a visible purpose 

837 

in this form viz. when a visible motive or purpose is obvious in the case of a rule or prescription it is not proper to ascribe an unseen or spiritual purpose or reason for it. This doctrine is older than even Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 12. 11 which says, 'where men act because they find pleasure in so doing, there śāstra has no scope'. Sabara also says, 1628 'those rules (in the smrti) that have a seen purpose derive their authority from that fact, while those that have no visible purpose may be inferred to be based upon the Voda (and derive their authority from that).' These words of Sabara are quoted by Kullūka on Manu III. 7 where Manu states that a girl should not be selected as a bride from a family that neglects the sanskāras, in which no male children are born, in which there is no Veda study, the members of which have on their bodies long and thick hair, that suffers from such diseases as piles, dyspepsia, epilepsy, black and white leprosy. Kullūka remarks that the works on medicine hold that such diseases are inherited and so if such a girl be married the progeny might suffer from those diseases, and thus this prohibition is based on a visible motive. From this a very important conclusion is drawn by dharmaśāstra writers viz. if one while performing a rite or when engaged in any matter acts contrary to a rule that has a seen purpose, the rite or matter does not become invalid or void, while where a rule is based on an unseen or spiritual purpose and it is infringed, the act itself becomes void or invalid. Yāj, I. 52 and 53 1629 prescribe among other things that the bride to be chosen by a man must be free from ( incur able ) diseases, must have a brother living, must not be a sapinda of the bridegroom or must not have the same gotra or pravra as that of the bridegroom. On this the Mit. remarks that if a man marries a girl who is suffering from an incurable disease, the marriage is valid, only he does an act which runs counter to seen results (i, e. he may suffer the consequence that

his children may be diseased ), but if he goes through a oere mony of marriage with a girl who is a gapiṇda or of the same gotra or prayara there is no valid marriage and the girl is not his legal wife. No clear visible purpose can be associated with the prohibition against marrying a sapiṇda or sagotra girl; hence there must be a spiritual purpose in that prohibition and 80 if one infringes it the act itself (viz. marriage) becomes void, 1630 

The Tantravārtika of Kumārila has as usual a very long note on this discussion. He does not see eye to eye with Sabara. He says 1631 that the Mimāṁsā is concerned with the investiga tion of dharma, that śruti is the prime authority in matters of dharma, that Mimāṁsā has concern with smrtis only so far as their authoritativeness in matters of dharma goes, that just as agriculture and the like are not discussed in Mimāṁsā works because they have a purely secular purpose, •80 all acts that men do for a visible worldly purpose have no bearing on the investigation of dharma and that therefore the bhāsyakāra (Sabara ) was not quite right in saying that such practices as rising to receive an old man or a teacher have a visible purpose and are authoritative on that ground. He further remarks that visible and invisible or spiritual purposes are often inextricably mixed up. When the Veda prescribes 'he pounds the grains of paddy' or enjoins a sacrifice like the Kārlri for bringing down rain, there is a visible purpose therein (0.g. the rice grains have to be freed from husk before boiled rice for obla tions can be prepared ). So even when an act has a seen purpose it may still have Veda as the basis ; so also an act such as rising to show respect to a teacher may have a seen result ( such as the teacher being pleased teaches the pupils with enthusiasm ) as well as an unseen result (viz. completion of Veda study without obstacles ). Therefore he argues that all

Authority of smslis depends on purpose 

839 

smrtis 1632 are authoritative according to the purpose they serve, that whatever portion of the smrtis is concerned with dharma and mokṣa ( final release from samsāra ) has its origin in the Veda and whatever is concerned with wealth and the satisfaction of desires (artha and kūna ) is based on worldly practices. In this way are to be explained the didactic portions of the Maha bhārata and the Purāṇas, the episodes in these being useful as urthavādus' (eulogies of what are prescribed as religious duties), the description of the several divisions of the earth being useful for indicating what countries are suitable for the per formance of dharma and the enjoyment of its rewards and being based partly on Veda and partly on direct experience. Similarly the auxiliary lores (angıs) of the Veda (such as phonetics, grammar, metrics &c.) are partly based on the Veda and partly on worldly experience. Mimāṁsa and Nyāya (logic) are necessary for the correct interpretation and understanding of the Veda ( as stated by Manu in XII. 105-106). He is even prepared to concede that systems 1633 like the Sāökhya ( which postulates a prime cause of the world called Pradhāna) or Vedānta ( which postulates Puruṣa as the cause of the world ), the theory of atoms ( propounded by Kanāda ) serve the purpose of explaining the creation and dissolution of the world, lead one to understand how the performance of sacrifices gives rise to the subtle apūrva which leads on to heaven and also exemplify how human effort and fate have their own spheres of operation (i. e. without human effort the world is produced and in spite of human effort it may be dissolved ). Kumārila goes a step further and states that even the Buddhist philosophies of vijnāna ( cognitions being the only reality ), of the non-exis tence of the soul or of eternal flux arise from the arthavada

He winds up by saying that in the case of all knowledge or works wherever the result (or reward) of the course laid down in them is to take place in the future and there is no possibility of experiencing its happening in the present such work may be deemed to be based on the Veda; but where, as in the science of medicine, the result can be seen taking place in other people, that know ledge is authoritative only because of the visible result. 

This discussion about smrtis based on the Veda or on perceptible purposes or motives is taken up in the digests on dharmaśāstra. For example, Aparārka 1634 (pp. 626-627 ) quotes long passages from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa dividing the contents of smṛtis into five categories and exemplifying that division, viz. (1) those based on a visible purpose or motive, (2) those based on unseen or spiritual motives or purposes, (3) those based on both visible purposes and unseen or spiritual purposes, (4) those based on reasoning, (5) those that merely re-iterate what is already well-known or determined. All these except the first variety are based according to the Bhaviṣyapurana on the Veda. The examples of the five kinds given by the same Purāṇa are respectively as follows: (1) the smrti (viz. Arthaśāstra or Dandaniti) in which there is a discussion about six gupas (sandhi &c.), the four upāyas (sāma, dāna &c.), the various superintendents of state departments (adlıyakṣa) and of kantakas; (2) the prescription that one should perform the sandhyū worship or that one should not partake of dog's flesh; (3) a brahmacūrin

Up. III. 5.1 (vyutthāyātha bhiksācaryam caranti) or Jābāla Up. 4. 

In I. 3. 5-7 Jaimini as interpreted by Sabara 1635 deals with the topic of the authoritativeness of certain usages laid down in the smṛtis in relation to Vedic rites. Sabara states : śiṣṭan say that religious rites should be performed after sipping water (i. e. after ācamana), one should wear the sacred thread in the upavita way in the worship of gods, one should do with the right hand all religious acts. The question is whether these aots should be done if not opposed to the sruti or should not be performed if opposed to what is taught in the Veda. The pūria pakṣıı view is that these acts should not be done because they run counter to the sequence of the acts laid down in the Veda. For example, the Veda says, 'after getting ready a bundle (or handful ) of kusa grass called veda one should prepare the redi (altar)'. Here the preparation of the vedi is declared to follow immediately after the getting ready of a liandful of kuśas. If after the handful is got ready a man has a sneeze he has accord ing to Manu V. 145 and Vas. III. 38 to sip water before going on with the preparation of the vedi. This would be against the sequence ( krama) of acts laid down in the Veda. Strangely enough Mr. K.L. Sarkar in T.L.L. (on Mimāmsā rules) translater the words 'vedam krtvā vedim karoti' as 'make the vedi and

then recite the vedas '(p. 241), thereby committing two mistakes He misunderstands the word 'veda' which in this passage only means a 'liandful of kuśas' and inverts the sequence of the acts denoted by the gerundial termination 'tvā'. On account of these two mistakes the discussion on pp. 240-242 is mislead ing and obscure. If a man were to do the things required in a vedic rite with both hands, he would be able to do them quickly. The smrti rule that every religious act should be done with the right hand alone interferes with the quick performance of religious acts. The established conclusion is that these religi ous acts (such as acaniana ) are performed by the sistas, are prompted by no visible motive ( such as covetousness ) and are therefore to be looked upon as authoritative, being not opposed to sruti. Kumārila does not like this way of explaining the gūtras, since the instances given by Sabara really do not deserve to be put forth as even prima facie opposed to Sruti. The Tantra vārtika (p. 201) sets out sruti pagaages wherein the wearing of the sacred thread in the upavita forin2636 (Tai. S. II. 5. 11. 1 and Tai. Ār. II. 1), acamana (Tai. Ā.. II. 11 ), are enjoined. Therefore it explains the sūtras in a different way. It splits up Jai. I. 3.5-7 into two adhikaraṇas. The first two constitute one topic. The pūrvapakṣa 1637 is : those precepts of Buddha and other founders of sects, such as the construction of monasteries and parks, the insistence on desirelessness, the practice of meditation, ahiṁsā, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness, are such that they are also laid down by the Veda, are not opposed to the ideas of sistas or do not run counter to nor rouge those who know the Veda to anger and therefore they must be held to be authoritative.

Authority of Bauddha doctrines about ahinsa &c.

be accepted as authoritative since only a limited 1638 number ( 14 or 18 ) of vidyās (the four vedas, the upavedas, the angas of the voda, the 18 smstis, purāṇas, Dandaniti) have been accepted by the vedic śistas as authoritative on matters of dharma and the works of the Bauddhas and Jainas are not included therein. Just as milk though originally pure becomes useless and unreliable when put into a bag of dog-skin, so the doctrines of Bauddhas such as ahimsā, though based on truth, are useless and are not authoritative in themselves for the followers of the Veda. 

The Tantravārtika holds that Jai. I. 3.7 is an adhikarana by itself and is concerned with the authoritativeness of sadācāra (the customs and usages of śistas ). Its position is that those usages are authoritative that are not opposed to express Vedic texts, that are practised by Vedic sistas under the belief that they are riglit conduct (dharına ) and for which no visible motive ( such as pleasure or the satisfaction of desires or the acquisition of wealth ) can be predicated. Sistas are those who perform the religious acts expressly enjoined by the Veda. They are not so called because they practise what is said to be sadācāra ; otherwise there will be an argument in a circle (in the form 'sadācāra means what is practised by śiṣṭas and sistas are those who practise sadācāra'). The practices traditionally handed down from generation to generation which are observed by sistas ( as stated above ) with the idea that they constitute a part of dharma must be regarded as dharma and as leading to heaven. 1639 Practices do not become authoritative by the mere fact that no such motive or purpose can be postulated for them, but they become so only when they are observed by śiṣṭas as

part of dharma. The Tantravārtika (p. 205 ) gives certain illustrations of such practices viz gifts, japa, mātryajña (offerings to the mother Goddesses ), the festival of Indra's banner, fairs held at temples, fasts by maidens on the 4th day of a month, gifts of lamps on the first day of Kārtika, the Apring 1640 festival on the first day of the dark half of Phālguna &c. The Tantravārtika is careful to point out that many activities such as agriculture, menial service or trade that are the means of securing wealth and pleasures and that give rise to several fixed and varying acts and also such actions as eating sumptuous food, drinking, sleeping on soft beds, possessing a charming house and garden, engaging in painting, singing and dancing, enjoying the fragrance of sandalwood and flowers, all of which are common to inlecchas and Aryas, are not deemed by any one to be part of dharma and that it does not follow that, because a few actions (of sigtas) are accepted as dharma, all their actions are to be looked upon as dharma.1641 In ordinary life certain practices only are deemed to be siṣtācāra, while there are certain other acts that are common to all human beings (including śiṣṭas ), but are not so regarded. Certain practices such as worship of gods and honouring brāhmaṇas are Been to be common among all people and yet do constitute dharma, because that is deemed to be so by the sistas. Those practices alone are dharma that are observed by sistas only as obligatory on thein and not other practices that are common to all beings. The Trantravārtika then refers to the Dharma

Ancient transgressions of dharma 

845 

sūtra 1642 of Gaut. ( 1.3 ) and Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 13.7-8) which say that ancient (or great) men in several instances were guilty of transgressions of dharma and of committing desperate acts, that on account of their spiritual merit they did not incur sin but if a man of later days were to follow them in the same acts he would sink into hell. It then gives twelve instances of lapses from good conduct (attributed even to avuārs ) that were trang grossions and either explains them away or says that they were due to wrath, hatred or other passions, were not intended by the authors ( of those acts ) themselves to be dharma and are not to be looked upon as śiṣṭācāra by modern men. The instances are: (1) Prajāpati who is said to have approached Uṣas, his daughter (Sat. Br. I. 7. 4. 1 or Ait. Br. 13. 9); (2) Indra, who is described as the paramour of Ahalyā ( in the Subrahmanya litany ); (3) Nahuṣa, who occupied the position of Indra, made approaches to Saci, the wife of Indra (Udyoga, chap. 13 ff) and was transformed into an jagura (Boa Constrictor);(4) Vasiṣtha, who when his 100 sons were devoured by a demon, was so struck with grief that he threw himself bound into the Vipāśā river(Nirukta IX.26, Adiparva chap. 177.1-6=cr. ed. 167. 1-6, Vanaparva 130. 8-9, Anuśāsana 3. 12-13); (5) Purūravas who thought of dying by hanging or by being devoured by wolves (Rg. X. 95. 14, Sat. Br. XI. 5. 1-8) when separated from Urvasi; (6) Viśvāmitra, who officiated as priest at the sacrifice of Trisanku that had become a cāndala through a curse ( Adiparva 71. 31-33);(7) Yudhisthira who took Draupadi as wife although she had been won by his younger brother Arjuna by his skill in archery and who prevaricated in order to bring about the death of his brāhmaṇa teacher Drona (Dronaparva 190. 55); (8) Kropa Dvaipāyana. (Vyāsa), wbo thought himself a perpetual student, procreated by niyoga at the request of his mother Satyavati two sons on the widows of his brother Vicitravīrya; (9) Bhiṣma who lived on without be longing to any ( of the four ) aśramas and who is said to have performed several Aśramedhas though he had no wife; (10)

Rāma who performed Asyamedha accompanied by a golden image of Sitā ; (11) Dhṛtarāstra, though blind, performed sacri fices; (12) Vāsudeva and Arjuna are described as being drunk and as having married Rukmini and Subhadrā respectively who were their maternal uncle's daughters (such marriages being forbidden). Kumārila, like a modern comparative mythologist, explains (Tantravārtika p. 208 ) that Prajapati means 'the Sun' who approaches (i. e. rises after ) the Dawn. This explanation is as old as the Ait. Br. 13. 9 where it is said that there are two views viz. it is either Heaven' or 'Uṣas' that is meant by the word 'daughter. Similarly Indra and Ahalyā respectively mean the Sun and the Night and jāra means literally one who makes to disappear or wither away' (and not paramour) in that passage. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1145 note 2550 for the epi thet. Ahalyāyai jāra' in the Veda and quotation from Tantra vārtika. The story of Ahalya and Indra varies in its details in the epics. Vide Rāmāyana I. 48, Udyoga 12. 6. These two are instances of transgression of dharma (dharma-vyatikrama) and the next case of Vasiṣtha is an example of sāhasa (through sorrow ). Kumārila says that Viśvāmitra was prompted by his hatred of Vasistha and his pride, that the sin accruing from his act would be neutralized by his great austerities. So his actions cannot serve as a model for imitation by others. Vyāsa, who was a son of Satyavati from Parāśara when she was a maiden, had Vicitravirya as (his uterine ) brother after Satya vati married Santanu. In the case of a brahmacārin, sexual intercourse is most reprehensible ( vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 374) But Vyāsa agreed to niyoga because of his regard for his mothe as allowed by Gaut. 18. 4-5. Kumārila adds that Vyāsa could do so on account of his great past and future austerities, that another person with similar qualifications may do so even in spite of all prohibitions, since the Mahābhārata ( Aśramavāsika 30. 24) says 'sarvam balavatāṁ pathyam' (to the strong every thing is wholesome or allowable). He gives an apt illustration. An elephant can devour branches of trees without harm, but others doing so would meet death. Dakṣa V.10 prescribes 'anāśra. ml na tiṣtheta kṣanamekamapi dvijaḥ' (a twice-born person should not stay even for a moment unattached to some āśrama), Bhisma remained unmarried out of filial devotion to his father and Rāma could not think of another wife as he was so much attached to Sitā. Kumārila boldly asserts that Bhisma hada wife only for the purpose of the sacrifices he performed (though this is mentioned in no Itibāsa or Purāṇa ) and relies upon the 

ILI )

mode of proof called arthāpotti for this 1643. His words are given below. This and some other explanations offered by Kumārila shed a very interesting light on the theological apologetics of Mimāmsakas. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 558 and 684 for Rāma and the golden image of Sitā. As to Yudhisthira's bringing about the death of his brābmana teacher the explanation is that the former performed Aśvamedha after the end of the war by way of prayascitta ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 147 11. 333 and pp. 1236-37 notes 2674-75 for Aśvamedha as the re mover of all sins). As to Draupadi being the wife of five brothers Kumārila quotes Adiparva 198. 14 ( =cr. ed. 190. 14) and offers several explana tions (p. 209 ), the most astounding being that there were five wives of the five brothers who were so similar that they were all referred to as one. As the Nyāyasudhā (p. 194 ) remarks, these various explanations were offered to show off great re sourcefulness of interpretation (paribāra-vaibhayārtham), the proper one being that the practice of the Pandavas was an evil one and was not to be imitated. A blind man could not perform sacrifices and was excluded from inheritance. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 157 n. 369 and vol. III. p. 609 n. 1154. But Kumārila says that as Dhstarāstra was blessed with sight for a while and saw his deceased sons through the miraculous power of Vyāsa ( Aśramavāsiparva chap. 32-37 ) he might have been endowed with sight at the time of the sacrifices or what is meant is that he made gifts which are spoken of as sacrifices. As regards Subhadrā, Kumārila asserts that in spite of the fact that Subhadra was said in the Adiparva ( 219,18 = cr. ed. 211. 18 ) to have been the daughter of, Vasudeva and sister of Krsna, she was really the daughter of Krspa's step-mother's sister or the daughter's daughter of the sister of his step-mother's father (a female cousin being often called a sister among the Lātas ). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 459-460 and notes to my edition of the text of V. Mayūkba ( pp. 200-202 ). Krsna's marriage with Rukmini is to be similarly explaind. It is somewhat surpris

As to the charge of drinking spirituous liquor (ubhau madhvāsa vakṣibau in Udyogaparva 59. 5) against both Vāsudeva and Arjuna, they were both ksatriyas and only brāhmaṇas were prohibited from drinking any kind of intoxicating drink (Gaut. II. 25), while to kṣatriyas and vaiśyas two kinds of wine called madhu ( liquor from honey or madhuka flowers) and sidhu (rum ) were allowed and only paiṣti ( spirituous liquor distilled from flour) was forbidden (by Gaut. II, 25, Manu XI. 93-94). 

Kumārila offers some other explanations of Jai.1644 I. 3. 5-7 which need not be set out here. 

Kumārila mentions certain practices of his times and concludes that they are to be condemned and not to be followed or regarded as authoritative. He says: 1645 even in these days brahmana women of Ahicchatra and Mathurā drink wine ; northerners ( northern brāhmaṇas ) engage in such transactions as the gift and sale of horses and mules that have a mano, asses,

camels and animals with two rows of teeth and eat from the same plate with their wives, children and friends; brāhmaṇas of the south enter into matrimony with the naternal uncle's daughter and take their meals while seated on a couch (of wicker work); both ( brāhmaṇas of the north and south ) tako cooked food ( kept in pots ) that remains after their friends or relatives have partaken of it or that has been touched by them. ( at the time of eating); they chew betelnut leaves that have been touched by persons of all varṇas, do not perform sipping of water (ācamana ) at the end of the chewing of betelnut, wear clothes washed by washermen and brought on the back of asses; they do not avoid contact even with persons guilty of grave sins (except of brāhmaṇa murder). There are everywhere an infinite number of very obvious transgressions of the subtle dictates of dharma laid down for each man, caste or family, that (transgressions ) are contrary to śruti, smrti and each other and that have a visible purpose behind them. It is not possible to regard such practices as authoritative.' Similarly Varadarāja, (1600-1660 A. D.) a pupil of Bhattoji Diksita, in his work styled the Gīrvānapadamañjari in a dialogue between a Kānyakubja brāhmaṇa and a sannyāsin hailing from Vijayanagara makes the brāhmaṇa host say that each country has certain practices which are durācāras such as marrying a maternal uncle's daughter in the south, marriage of girls among southerners even before they are four years old, sitting down to a meal without bathing in Karnātaka, in Mahārāstra the marriage of a younger brother before an elder one, in the hilly country the practice of niyoga (vide Mr. P. K. Gode's interesting paper in 'Bharatiya-vidya' vol. VI pp. 27-30). 

According to Sabara, Jaimini in I. 3. 8-9 deals with certain words like yava, varāha and vetasa, that have different signi ficances among Aryas and Mlecchas ( and therefore these sūtras constitute what is called yavavarāhādhikarana). But Kumārila does not like this view of Sabara and proposes another topic for these two sutras, viz. the relative strength of smrti and sadācāra where they are in conflict. Here there are three 1646 possible

views, viz. that both are equally strong and so there is an option in case of conflict, that ācāra is stronger, that smrti is the stronger of the two. The prima facie view is that both are equally strong, since smrti and sadācāra are both inferred to be based upon Veda. Kumārila's own final conclusion is that smrti is of greater force than ācāra, that is, where they come in direct conflict smṛti sliould prevail. His position is that, though both smrti and acāra are to be deemed to be based on Veda, there is a difference between the two. People have full faith in such smrtis as that of Manu and Manu and others are believed to have been inspired sages and are the propounders of the rules of dharma scattered about in various Vedic śākhās, while the same cannot be said about modern men and their practicos cannot claim or possess the same weight and allegiance that the practices laid down by Manu and other sages can From the practice of sistas one may infer a smrti as the root thereof and then further one may infer a śruti as the root of the smrti. Therefore acāra is removed by two stages from the Veda, while smrti is removed only by one stage from the Veda. Hence Kumārila says that in case of conflict smrti should prevail over &cāra. The practices that are discussed here ( acc. to Kumārila, Parthasarathi and others ) are such as the marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter or with a paternal aunt's daughter and the like that are in vogue among certain people and that are yet opposed to emstis (such as Manu XI, 171-72 ) and for which a visible motive can easily be found (kāmādihetvuntaran spasta meva drtyate, as the Sāstradipikā says) 

Kumārila gives another (and so a third ) explanation of Jai. I. 3, 8-9 1647 which need not detain us here.

Holākādhikarana 

851 

Jai. I. 3. 15-23 constitute what is called Holākadhikarana, or Samānyaśrutikalpanādhikarana. The first two and the last two gūtras are the most important. Certain practices 1648 like the Holaka (spring) festival are observed by the easterners, certain others like Åbninaibuka (worship of growing Karanja or Arka or other trees as handed down in one's family ) by the southerners, and the Udvrsabhayajña (honouring oxen on the Full Moon of Jyestha and making them run a race) by the nor therners. The question is: whether, in making an inference about these practices being based on Veda, one was to suppose that the inferred Vedic text also should be restricted to the easter ners and the like 1649. The pūrvapakṣa view is that the śruti to be inferred as the basis of the respective practices must be deemed to be restricted to certain persons only (such as the easterners i. e. pracyas &c.). The established conclusion is that 

(Continued from the last page) should not be gifted on account of the prohibition contained in 'he does not give kesarin': एष हि विशेषोश्चानामग्येभ्यो द्रव्येभ्यो यदेषां दानं प्रतिषिध्यते न केसरिणो दधाति नोभयतोदतः प्रतिगृहातीति विश्वजित्येव समाम्नायते. The मीमांसाको.

[Vol. 

such practices must be deemed to be meant for all, since the general rule about vedic injunctions is that they are applicable to all. The performer specially meant by each Vedic injunction is known in either of three ways, 1650 viz. by capability, by non prohibition and by the employment of a special epithet or attribute. When it is said 'svargakāmo yajeta' then only the three twice-born classes are meant, for, they alone are capable of tending the sacred fires and of possessing Vedic learning and a śūdra is not a fit person to whom that injunction can apply. Those who are guilty of grave sins (patita) and the impotent are prohibited from performing Vedic rites. When the Veda says ' rājā rājusūyena yajeta' there is a special attribute of the performer ( viz. being a ksatriya ) prescribed by the śruti and so no one else can perform Rājasūya. When none of these three exists a Vedic vidhi is in general meant for all (sarvadharma). The practices of Holākā, Vrṣabhayajña and the like should not be held to be restricted to certain countries or people only, but should be inferred to be applicable to all. When a man leaves the east and goes to the south, he may still perform the Holākā festival; while a man from the eastern country itself may not perform it at all. Further the words 'southern, eastern and northern' are relative. A country that is called southern may be to the north of another. Therefore Holākā and other practices are not invariably concomitant with particular countries or peoples. Nor can it be said that those practices require those particular countries for their performance in the way in which Sruti expressly requires the Vaiśvadeva rito ( one of the four cāturmāsyas ) to be performed on a spot that slopes towards the east. The Tantravārtika 1651 points out that persons receive appellations from names of countries on various grounds as being born in a country or as residing therein or as coming from that country or as going to that country. Medhātithi ,on Manu VIII. 46 says the same.

Authorituliveness of GȚhya and Dharma sutras 

853 

The Tantravārtika explains that the first two gūtras are meant to refer to another question also, viz. whether the rules of the grhyasutras 1652 and of such dharmasutra works as the sātra of Gautama are authoritative only as to certain groups or are meant to be authoritative for all. He begins by saying that the Puranas, the Manusmrti and Itihāsa ( i. e. the Mahabharata) are equally authoritative for all people and then points out that the Gobhila-gļhya and Gautama-dharmasutra are traditionally accepted by the students of the Sāmaveda, that the dharmasutra of Vasistha is accepted by the students of the Rgveda, the sūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita by the followers of the white Yajurveda and the sūtras of Apastamba and Baudhāyana by the followers of the Taittirfya Sakhā. The Śāstradipikā explains that an author who was a student of the Samaveda taught his own work to his pupils who also learned the Sāmaveda under him, that these pupils in their turn taught that work to others and in that way there arose a tradition among the students of the Sāmaveda to study the sūtra of Gautama. Therefore, to say even as to gļhyā works that they are restricted to particular groups of persons is not correct. Similarly in the case of practices there is no epithet or attribute that is common to all those who practise them or which distinguishes those who do not observe them from those that observe them and therefore it is not possible to restrict such practices as Holākā to particular countries or groups of people. 

The requisites of valid customs ag laid down by the emi. nent writers of the Purva-mimamsa school may now be suin marised. Such customs must be ancient, must not be opposed to the express texts of the Veda or of sinsti, must be such as to be regarded as obligatory by the sistas and must be observed

It has to be remembered that the pūrvamimāmsā writers did not lay down anything about the binding character of usages that were peculiarly secular but restricted their remarks to customs and usages that had more or less an unseen or spiritual purpose. Khandadeva emphasizes this by stating *only those customs can be deemed to be based on the Veda that are not opposed to the Veda and smṛtis and that are obser ved by respectable people under the belief that thereby they are carrying what dharma dictates '1653. Medhātithi on Manu 1655 II. 18 makes this position quite clear after quoting a verse of Kumārila'a smṛti that is opposed to the Veda or is self-contra dictory, or has a visible secular purpose or expressly states a motive (for observing its precepts) cannot be deemed to be based on the Veda'. The Mimāmsā-kaustubha (p. 51 on Jai. I. 3.7) quotes a verse to the effects that only those whose ancestors also observed certain usages handed down from gene ration to generation would not incur blame by observing them (if they are opposed to śruti or smrti), but not others ( who

This verse refers to ave classes of smsti texts that caopot be based on अति. शार्धा च आविष्कारणा चटार्धादिष्ठकारणे (स्मृती); याच एषा संभवतिः is the fifth class, but the meaning is not clear. Sir Ganganath Jha in his translation of Medhatitbi does not say whence this verse is taken, por does he correctly render the words विगीता and rधार्धाविष्टकारणे and be omits altogether the fourth pada. The words या चैषा सम्भवभूतिः appear to mean 'that smrti which declares its promulgation (by a sage) is not to be deemed to be based on Veda (since otherwise Veda will be held to be not nitya).
