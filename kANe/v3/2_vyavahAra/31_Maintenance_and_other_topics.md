CHAPTER XXXI 

MAINTENANCE AND OTHER TOPICS 

The subject of maintenance occupies an important place in modern Hindu Law. A brief statement of the law of the smrtis and the digests on this subject must be made here. 

The liability to provide maintenance for certain persons arises under the ancient Hindu Law in either of two ways viz. (1) on account of bare relationship between the parties or (2) on the ground of the possession of property. A verse 1559 quoted by Medhatithi on Manu III. 7% and IV, 251, by the Mit. on Yāj. 1. 224 and II. 175 and occurring in some mss. of the Manusmrti after XI. 10 provides, 'Manu declares that one must maintain one's aged parents, a virtuous wife and a minor son by doing even a hundred bad acts.' From this verse it follows that irrespective of the possession of property there is a personal legal obligation on the father to maintain his minor son, on the husband to maintain his wife and on the son to maintain his aged parents. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 48) goes further and provides 1560 that a son is bound to maintain a mother even if she be patita. To the same effect are Āp. Dh. S. I. 10. 28. 9 and Vas. 13. 47.

The texts of Manu, Yāj. 1. 76 and Nār, are held on p. 598 of that report to impose a personal obligation enforceable by the State, Vide Raja Rama Rao v. Raja of Pittapur 45 1. A. 148 at p. 154 where it is stated that the grandson is not included under the word 'son' and a grandfather is under no personal obligation to maintain a grandson if there is no ancestral property in bis hands. .. 1560.

History of Dharmatastra 

[Vol. Manu VIII. 389 prescribes that the man who abandons and does not maintain his parents, wife and son, when they are not patita, should be fined 600 pams by the king. Nār. also (S. B. E. 33 p. 184 verse 95) provides punishment for such a husband. Yāj. I. 76 states that if a man abandoned a wife who was obedients diligent, the mother of a son and agreeable in speech he was to be made to give one third of his property to the wife and to maintain her, if he had no property. Viṣṇu Dh. 8. V. 163 made the husband punishable like a thief if he abandoned his blame less wife. Kaut. II. 1 prescribes 1561 that if a man being able fails to maintain his child or wife, parents, minor brothers and sisters, unmarried daughters, widowed daughters, when these are not patita, should be fined twelve panas. These dicta have been followed even by modern courts in India. In Subbarayana v. Subbakka 1562 it has been held that a son is bound to maintain his aged mother whether he has inherited property from his father or not. 

The manager of a joint Hindu family is under a legal obligation to maintain all male members of the family, their wives and children. Nārada states 1563 that if any one among Beveral (undivided ) brothers dies without issue or becomes an ascetio the rest should take the estate and give maintenance to his wives till their death, provided they keep the bed of their husband unsullied but that they may cut off the maintenance If they (wives) behave otherwise. This is because the surviv ing brothers succeed to the estate in which the deceased had an interest during his lifetime. This is made quite clear 1564

Maintenance of widows 

805 

in the Sm. C. explaining a verse of Nar, viz.' widows that are virtuous must be maintained with food and raiment by the eldest brother (of the deceased) or by the father-in-law or by any other gotraja' on which it remarks:: "The words by him who takes the estate'must be understood before all the words such as 'the eldest brother'". Kāt. ( 922 ) states, when the husband goes to heaven the wife is entitled only to food and raiment if he was unseparated or she may set a share in ( ancestral ) property till her death'. The Sm. C. remarks that as maintenance depends upon taking wealth, Kāt. provides two alternatives. In cases too numerous to cite this has been followed by all High Courts. Similarly an heir is bound to maintain out of the estate taken by him those persons whom the deceased was legally or morally bound to maintain. Those persons who are excluded from inheritance or partition are entitled to maintenance and their virtuous wives and unmarried daughters also are entitled to be maintained ( Yaj. II. 140-142 Manu IX. 202, Vas. 17, 54). The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 43-46 ) 1565 provides that those who are past undertaking transactions (i. e. are very old ) should be given food and raiment and also those who are blind, idiotic, impotent, immersed in vice and suffering from ( incurable ) diseases, and those that engage in prohibited acts, except the patila and his issue. Devala ( quoted in the V. Mayukha p. 165 ) has a similar passage, when the father is dead (or even when being alive he makes a partition) the impotent, the leper, the lunatic, the idiot, the blind, an outcast and his offspring, a person wearing a heretical sect mark-these are not entitled to a share of the heritage; to these except the patita food and raiment are to be given'. These persons suffer from a personal disqualification and maintenance is given to them in lieu of a share not because their status is denied but because they are incapable of management and enjoyment of property. Vide Raja Ram Rao v. Raja of Pittapur. 1566 

The general principle is that an heir is legally bound to provide outrof the estate taken by him as heir maintenance for those persons, male or female, whom the late owner was morally or legally bound to maintain. For example, if there is no ancestral property the father-in-law, who possesses only self

soquired property is not legally bound to maintain his daughter in-law ( widow of a predeceased son); but on the death of the father-in-law, his heir i. e, son, widow, or daughter would be legally bound to maintain a widowed daughter-in-law. 1566a The Bombay High Court, however, adds the condition that the predeceased son must have been in union with his father when he died ; vide 23 Bom. 608. 

By Act XVIII of 1937 it has been provided that in a family governed by the Mitakṣarā the widows of deceased copardeners such as the daughter-in-law and the grand-daughter-in-law are entitled to their husband's interest. The Act does not expressly state that their rights to maintenance are taken away. In many cases such widows may prefer to take a share instead of being allotted only maintenance and so far the law of mainten ance will tend to become obsolete. 

Another important question is what is the effect of uncha stity on the right to maintenance ? As regards the wife's right to maintenance and the effect of unchastity thereon during the busband's lifetime, vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 571-73 above. Manu XI. 176 says that a wife guilty of adultery should be confined by the husband in the same house and should be made to undergo the same penance as a man guilty of adultery has to undergo; Yāj I. 70 also says that a wife guilty of adultery should be deprived of her status as a wife as to wealth and religious observances, should be given bare maintenance and should be confined to a part of the house. Unohastity on the part of a Hindu widow disentitles her to maintenance under certain circumstances Vas. 21. 10 provides that four classes of wives must be abandoned viz. one who yields herself to her husband's pupil or to his guru and especially one who attempts the life of her husband or who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste and in 21. 12 Vasiṣtha states that the wives of brahmaṇas, ksatriyas and vaibyas, who commit adultery with a sūdra, may be purified by penance if no child is born ( of the adulterous intercourse) but not otherwise'. It is provided by Yaj. I. 72 that if a woman ( of the three higher castes ) conceives through adultery with a sūdra or kills her foetus or attempts the death of her husband or is guilty of grave sins (such as brahmana-murder ) she shall be abandoned.

Maintenance and unchastity 

801 

Manu IX. 188 provides that when women beoomr patita, the rite callad ghatasphota (the procedure of which may be seen at P. 388 of the H. of Dh. vol. II and in note 1168 in the Appendix to this volume ) may be performed, but they must be given food and raiment and they must be provided with a hut near the family house. Yaj. III. 296 has a similar provision. The result is that there is no text which provides that a widow who is once unchaste must be deemed unchaste for ever and must for ever forfeit her olaim even to a starving snaintenance even if she repents, reforms her ways and gives up an immoral life. On the contrary the texts say that widows guilty of adultery are purified by penance and may be restored to all their social privileges. For example, Manu 1567 XI. 189 says generally about all persons that after they perform the appropriate prūyascitta, they should not be rebuked or avoided (but should be restored to all social intercourse ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 72 expressly says that the abandonment of oven such women as are referred to in that verse consists in not associating with them conjugally and in religious matters, but does not mean that they are to be driven out of the house. 1568 

On Yaj. III. 297 ( which states that in the case of women there are three peculiarly grave sine piz, adultery with a low caste man, killing the foetus and attempt to murder the husband) the Mit. sumg up the whole position as follows: (1) total abandonment of women for the four grave sius laid down in Vas. 21. 10 takes place when they do not perform penance; (2) women guilty of adultery not of the aggravated kind mentioned in Vas. 21. 10 are to be given starving maintenance that would keep body and soul together and are to be lodged in & hut near the house and to be afforded protection (Yaj. I. 70 and III. 296 ), even if they do not perform the requisito penance. But the Mit. is silent as to the claim to maintenance of widows that at first led a life of incontinence ( but not of the aggrava ted kind) and subsequently reformed their ways. But from Manu XI. 189 it may be inferred that widows not guilty of

aggravated adultery that have undergone the proper prayascitta and that return to decent life would have been entitled to ordinary maintenance from the period they turned over a new leaf. 1569 

A brief reference to the modern case law on this point may be made here. In Bhikubai v. Hariba 1870 Sir Lallubhai Shah ( after an elaborate examination of ancient and medieval authorities and decided cases ) hield that a widow who had been unchaste, but who is proved to have given up the life of un chastity is entitled to baro maintenance. In Lakhmichand v. Anandi the Privy Council make the general observation : 1571 It is true that the right of a Hindu widow to maintenance is conditional upon her leading a life of chastity and that she loges that right if she becomes unchaste'. In Kisanji v. Lakshmi 1572 it was held that subsequent unchastity disentitled a widow from recovering maintenance, even though it is claim able under an agreement made with the deceased husband's father and brother. In Musammat Ganga v. Ghasita 1 All. 46 (F. B.) it has been held that unchastity does not incapacitate a daughter from inheriting stridhana. In Angammal v. Venkata 26 Mad. 509 the same rule was laid down. 

The illegitimate son born of a sūdra concubine to a man of the three higher castes appears to have been held entitled to maintenance from very early times. Gaut. 28. 37 provides, *the son from a sūdra woman of a man (of the three higher varpas ) who is without issue receives maintenance (lit, source of maintenance ), if he is obedient, in the same way as a pupil might receive'. And Gautama (28.43) extends the same rule to the offspring of pratiloma unions. Vide p. 601 above and note 1135 for the text of Gaut. and Br. on the point. Manu IX.

It is not to be presumed from the omission to provide for such a contingency that the resumption once made is to be irrevocable and that the fallen woman who had reformed is to be denied even a starving allowance'.

Maintenance of an illegitimate son 

809. 

155 also provides that the son of a man of the three higher castes from & sūdra woman (not married to him) is not entitled to share in the ancestral estate. Bp. (8.B.E. 33 p. 374 v. 31 ) states 1573 that an obedient and meritorious son born from a woman of the śūdra caste to a man who has no other child should get main tenance and that the sapiṇdas should divide the rest of the wealth of the deceased. Both the Mit. and the V. Mayūkba, while explaining Yaj. II. 133-134 about the rights of the illegitimate son of a sūdra from a śūdra woman, remark that one who is begotten on a dāsi 1574 by a member of the regenerate classes is not entitled to a share even at the father's choice nor to a half share after his father's death but that he is only ontitled to maintenance. 1575 

There is a good deal of case law on this subject, but much of it is irrelevant in this treatise. The right of maintenance attaches in the first instance to the separate property of the putative father and if the latter leaves no such property but was a member of a joint family it attaches to the property of the joint family of which the putative father was a member. 1576 It has further been held that it does not matter if the woman was not a dāsi (a slave ) or a permanent concubine in the exclusive keeping of a man or that the intercourse was adult erous. 1577 It has been also held that the illegitimate son's right to maintenance is a personal right and cannot be transmitted to his son 1578 and that maintenance has to be provided for him till his death 1579 (and not merely up to his attaining majority),

except in Bengal. 158 The fact that the texts employ the word " sūdrāputra" (in the masculine gender) has been interpreted by the decided cases as involving that an illegitimate daughter is not entitled under Hindu Law to maintenance. Vide Parvati v. Ganpatrao 1581 and Vellaiyappa v. Natarajan. 1582 

Another frequent subject of litigation in modern times hag been a concubine's right of maintenance under the Hindu Law, It has been held that a concubine has no legal right to claim maintenance from her paramour during the latter's lifetime, as he can discard her at any time and as she cannot compel him to keep her. 1583 So also a Hindu is not entitled to transfer joint family property to a concubine for her maintenance during his lifetime. 1584 But on the death of the paramour a great difference is made in the rights of a concubine that was in his exclusive keeping till his death. Such a concubine has been held to possess a legal right to maintenance payable out of the estate, ancestral or self-acquired as the case may be, in the hands of those who take it after the death of the paramour. The rights of women, who are not wives, to maintenance are based mainly on two texts, viz. of Nārada and Kātyāyana, that are explained in the Mit., the V. Mayukha and other medieval works. Narada says : 1585 ' A king devoted to dharma should give maintenance to the women ( stri) of a deceased person (when the king succeeds as heir by escheat), except when the deceased person is a brāhmana'; while Kāt. (931 ) states, 1586 " heirless property goes to the king after keeping aside ( wealth sufficient to provide ) for the women (yosit), the dependents (or servants ) and the funeral rites and sraddhas (of the deceased)'.

Maintenance of concubine 

811 

Kaut, algo similarly prescribes (HII, 1587 5. p. 161 ), the king takes heirless property except that of Srotriyas, setting apart ( wealth ) for the maintenance of women ( of the deceased), for funeral rites and for poor or wretched (dependents of the deceased). The Mit., the V. Mayūkha, the Par. M. and others state that the verses of Nār. and Kāt, refer to avaruddha. stri alone, since the word patni ( duly wedded wife ) does not occur therein, but only the words 'yoṣit' and 'stri '. 1586 There has been a great divergence of views in the decided cases about the significance of avaruddha stri. It is generally rendered as 

a concubine or mistress in the exclusive keeping of a person till the latter's death'. Several conditions are necessary to constitute a woman an avaruddha stri capable of claiming maintenance from the estate of her deceased paramour in the hands of his sons or other heirs. In the first place, she must have been continuously and exclusively in his keeping till his death. How long she should have been thus in his keeping cannot be fixed by any hard and fast rules. She must have been so long in his keeping continuously till his death that it can be said that the connection had become permanent. In Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai a period of five years was deemed to be sufficient. In the second place the concubine 1589 must observe sexual fidelity to her deceased paramour after bis death in order to be able to claim maintenance from the estate in the hands of his heirs or successors. In Bai Monghibai v. Bai Nagubai 1590 a third condition was laid down yiz, that the con nection of the concubine with the deceased paramour should be perfectly open and recognized and she must have been kept practically as a member of the family. But in Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai 1591 the Privy Council overruled the above deci sion and held that in order to entitle a mistress to maintenance it is not necessary that she should have resided in the same

sen overtuinoids that are the estate 

house with the deceased together with his wife and the ordinary members of his family. And in Dayavati v. Kesarbai 1592 it was further held that the concubine need not prove that she was recognized by the family of the deceased or that his relationsbip with her was known to the family. A further restriction was imposed by the case of Anandilal 1. Chandralai 1593 that the intercourse with the paramour should not have been adulterous. But this case has been overruled by a recent Full Bench deci. sion in Alcku v. Ganesh 1594 which holds that a permanently kept concubine is entitled to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased paramour, although she has a husband living ( who was examined in the cage as a witness ), provided she observes sexual fidelity to the deceased paramour after his death. It becomes, therefore, necessary to examine the Sanskrit medieval commentaries and digests in order to arrive at a correct inter pretation of the expression 'avaruddha stri', Strangely enough, the Mit does not define the word in the section on dayabhāga, but only under stri-sangrahapa'. Yaj. II. 290 provides,' a man should be awarded a fine of fifty panas, if he has intercourse with disis that are avaruddhā or that are bhujipya and also (other women such as prostitutes and svairinis ), even though ordinarily they (i: e. dāsis and others ) are approachable (with out incurring the consequence of punishment). The Mit. explains that the word 'ca' placed after 'bhujisyāgu' in Yāj. II. 290 is meant to include vesyas and svairiṇis along with bhuji gyās. Acc. to the Mito the verse prescribes the same fine for intercourse with three kinds of women, viz. dāsis that are ava ruddha, dāsis that are bhujisyā and other women such as vesyās (who are ordinarily approachable by all males of their own or higher castes) and svairinis ( who abandon their husbands and resort at their desire to some other male of their own caste, as defined by Yāj. I. 67). A woman though originally a veryū or a svairini may be known to be kept by a man. In that case if another man approaches her, Yāj. II. 290 declares that he would be liable to be fined in the same amount as if he approached an avaruddha dasi or bhujiṣyā, because being in the keeping of another at the time she would be like a wife ( as the other two classes do ) so far as punishment for approaching a kept woman is concerned. This verse is not concerned with the maintenance

of women at all. The Mit: here defines 'avaruddha dasl' as "a slave woman who is prohibited by her master from intercourse with other men with an order to stay in the master's house alone in order that there may be no loss of attendance ( on the mas ter )." The Mit. defines a bhujisyū dāsi as one who is restricted (as to enjoyment) to certain definite males' (purusaniyata-pari grahā bhujisyah ). 1595 It is worthy of note that the Mit. employs different phraseology in defining the two words. In defining a bhujisyā it employs the word 'niyata', which generally means 'fixed or definite', while in defining 'avaruddha' it employs the word 'niruddhaḥ' meaning "prevented or prohibited'. If the two words were intended to convey the same meaning, there is no reason why the Mit. should not have employed the same word (niruddha) in defining a bhujisya. The difference between an avaruddhā dāsi and a bhujisya is that the former is ordered to stay in the master's house, while the bhujisya is not 80 ordered and secondly the avaruddha is forbidden to have sexual intercourse with any one except the master, while the bhujiṣyā is not so forbidden, but she is to restrict herself to 

enjoyment by certain specified males ( friends or men of the master's family ) and not necessarily by the master alone, This is the meaning assigned to those words by Mitramitra in his commentary 1596 (not his digest) on Yāj. II. 290. The Mit. itself indicates the meaning of 'niyata'by saying elsewhere that owner ship springs from certain fixed sources (niyatopāyakain svatram on Yaj. II. 114). It is respectfully submitted that the Privy Council gave a wrong interpretation of the word 'avaruddha' in Bai Nugubai vi Bai Monghibai 1597. Though slavery is now abolished in India there is no reason why the two characteris tics of avaruddha (viz, staying in the master's house and being

exclusively kept by the master) stated by the Lit. should not have been strictly adhered to by the Privy Council, particularly when they were holding heirs liable for the maintenance of kept mistresses, which is hardly ever allowed in any other system of law. With the greatest respect to the Full Bench, it must be said they went wrong in holding that bhujisyā means *a mistress who is restrained from intercourse with other per sons (other than the master)' and in holding that the only distinction between an araruddhā and a bhujisyā is that the former is required to stay in the house of the paramour, while the latter is not ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 13 and 22). The learned judges have not correctly interpreted the word 'niyata' and also the explanation of 'bhujigya' given by the Balambhatti 1598. The meaning of the Bālambhatti was misunderstood on account of the wrong meaning attached to the word 'niyata'. What the Balambhatti means in explaining the definition of bhujiaya is 'one who is to be enjoyed by certain definite males only other than the master (i. e. by the master and also certain defined males) and it does not mean 'who is forbidden to be enjoyed by males other than the master'. 

The F. B. further rely upon a passage of the Mit. in support of their conclusion ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 14 and 22). On the question of what properties are impartible, the Mit. on Yāj. II. 119 quotes Manu IX. 219 viz. 'clothes, conveyances, ornaments, cooked food, water (wells &c.), women, yogakṣema and pastures (or ways)--these they der are are impartible.'The Mit. explanation1599 of the word ' striyah 'may be translated as follows: *striyah' here means 'fomaie slaves ; if they are uneven in number they should not be divided by taking their price into consideration, but they are to be made to work in turns (for the separated members of the family ), but as regards women kept by the father such as svairinis and the rest, they are not to be divided by the sons even though they be even in number". It is difficult to see how this passage supports the Full Bench decision. That

Meaning of avaruddha

passage can be explained in two or three different ways. In the first place, the Mit. having itself clearly distinguished and defined three classes, viz. avaruddha, bhujigya and svairinis ( together with vośyas also ) it cannot be lightly supposed that elsewhere it gives up that distinction. Therefore it would be difficult to say that here ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) the Mit, means that svairinis are also the same as avaruddhās. Hence the inter pretation should be that women who are avaruddha ( kept exclusively by the father) and even other women also like svairipis ( who had sexual connection with the father though not as avaruddhā ) should not be divided i. e. a 'ca' should be understood after 'svairinyadyah'. Or it is possible to hold that the word ' avaruddha ' in that passage is not employed in the strict technical sense (as defined by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 290 ). but in its etymological sense meaning 'women who are svairinis and the like that are taken into his harem (or under his protec tion ) by the father should not be divided'. This interpretation derives support from the explanation offered by the Subodhini (which is repeated almost verbatim by the Balambhatti ) about the text of Gautama quoted by the Mit. that 'gamyukta' in Gaut. means 'enjoyed' or 'confined' (in the house ). This shows that the words 'ruddha' and 'avaruddha' were used in the etýmological sense be distinguished writers. The Sm. C. II. p. 321 while explaining the word ' ruddha' in Manu IX. 12 applied to a wife guilty of adultery explains it as mean ing 'confined in a part of the house (grhe avaruddhām). When the Mit. states (p. 811) that the verses of Nār, and Kat. refer to avaruddhā stri it follows that these verses do not refer to bhujisyā, who would therefore be deemed not entitled to maintenance at all.

These are not quite germane to thọ present. volume, particularly because most of the decisions on these

(Vol. 

matters are not based on the words of the smṛtis or of the medieval digests, but are based on logic and principles of justice and equity. But there is one matter which deserves & passing reference. Ancient Hindu Law, attached the highest spiritual importance to the payment of debts ( vide pp. 414-417 above ). Therefore debts contracted by a Hindu are held by the Courts to take precedence over the right of maintenance of a man's wife, his infant child or his widow after his death. 1600 Similarly debts contracted by the manager of the joint family of which the widow's husband was a member would take precedence over the widow's right of maintenance, provided the debts were for the benefit of the family or were for legal necessity. 

The last vyauhārapadu is prakirnalca, which is defined by Visṇu Dh. S. 42. 1 as 'miscellaneous' (yadanuktam tat pra kirṇakam ) or by Nār. as matters that were to be set in motion by the king himself (vide note 331 ). These have been dealt with above and do not require any further treatment here. 

At the end of this section ou Vyavahāra it would not be out of place to say a few words about wille. Owing to the joint family system and the custom of adoption testamentary dis positions did not come into vogue in ancient India. Among the many kinds of documents (lekhya) mentioned by Kaut., Bṛ., Kāt. and others cited above there is no term for a document which can convey the idea of a modern will. But it need not be supposed that the idea had not at all dawned upon the minds of people before the advent of the British 1601 Wills were known among Mahomedans and contact with them would naturally suggest the idea of a will. Oral or written instructions by a man expecting death to his heirs intended to affect the disposal of his property must have been given occasionally and should not

be supposed to have been entirely unknown. Verses 341-359 of the Rajatarangipi IV. appear to embody the political testament of king Lalitāditya of Kashmir in the first half of the 8th century. Kat. (566) makes a very near approach to the modern conception of a will 1602. He says, 'if a gift was promised by a man for a religious purpose whether when in good health or when afflicted with disease, the son should be made to pay it, if the father dies without giving it over.' Here the mere declara-. tion of the intention of a person was made enforceable after his death against the son or other heir. Bphaspati's verse saying that a promise or direction to take effect after the death of the promisor was not ordinarily enforceable has already been quoted above (n. 823 ). In the quarterly of the Bhārata-itihāsa. samsodhaka Mandala of Poona, vol. XX p. 210 (for May 1940 ) there is a letter ( dated 1775 A. D.) written by one Naro Babaji, who, after referring to his illness, provides on a generous scale for his funeral and sraddha expenses and makes dispositions in favour of his daughter-in-law, of another widow, and for the marriage of his kingman's sons and distribution of the balance

[ Vol. 

One of the earliest wills to come before the British Indian Courts was that of the notorious Umichand 1605 (who died in. 1758 A. D.). Bengal Regulation XI of 1793 recognized by section VI the power of a Hindu proprietor to make a will or declaration giving, prior or subsequent to 1st July 1794, his entire landed estate to his eldest son or next heir or other son or heir or to any person or persons. In a Bombay case the will of a Hindu nmade in 1789 is referred to 1605. A Pundit of the Recorder's court of Bombay gave it as his opinion in 1812 A.D., there is no mention of wills in our Shaster; therefore they ought not to be made' ( vide Strange's Hinda Law, vol. II p. 449 ). In I. L. R. (1940) 1 Cal. 415 at p. 424 the Privy Council observe that the Hindu will in its present form is a developnient since the middle of the 18th century. 

. It is beyond the scope of this work to dilate on the modern Acts dealing with Testamentary dispositions such as the Indian Succession Act (Act 39 of 1925 ). 

Now that the foregoing lengthy presentation of the ancient and medieval Hindu judicial procedure and substantive law has been brought to a close a few general observations may be indulged in here. The Hindu Law of pleading and evidence compares favourably with similar laws of many other countries and has extorted the admiration and encomiums of such

eminent Jurists and Judges as Sir William Jones, Sir Thomas Strange and others. For example, Sir Thomas Strange in * Hindu Law '(1830) vol. I observes ( at p. 311), "sufficient be it to observe that Hindu pleading was noticed with commendation by Sir William Jones and that, with some trifling exceptions, the Hindu doctrine of evidence is, for the most part, distin guished nearly as much as our own, by the excellent sense that determines the competency and designates the choice of wit nesses with the manner of examining and the credit to be given them; as well as by the solemn earnestness with which the obligation of truth is urged and inculcated; insomuch that less cannot be said of this part of their law than that it will be read by every English lawyer with a mixture of admiration and delight, as it may be studied by him to advantage. Even the pious perjury which it has been supposed to sanction1605a being resolvable after all into no greater liberty than what our juries (not indeed with perfect approbation) have long been allowed to take, where the life of a prisoner on trial before them is at stake; credit is to be given to the pregnant brevity of the Hindu oath yiz.'what you know... declare at large and with truth'(Manu VIII. 80 ); as also to the noble warning, with which the subject as detailed by Manu is ushered in, that'either the court must not be entered by judges, parties and witnesses or law and truth must be openly declared' (Manu VIII. 13 )." The medieval digests made a very near approach to the modern ideal of equality of all men before the law. How even in the 20th century the much vaunted equality before the law of all people in England is far from being achieved and how it often proves quite illusory where the poor or the labouring classes are concerned is well brought out in a book entitled 'Justice in England' by a Barrister published by Victor Gollancz in 1938, especially in chapters I and VI. The Hindu jurists evolved tolerably clear and sound ideas about contracts, debts, deposits and pledges, sales, mortgages and gifts of immovable properties, developed a system of joint fanily rights and liabilities and laid down a peculiar law of inheritance and succession to males and females. The Hindu* system of inheritance and succession

pursues a middle course. It does not distribute the estate of a deceased person simultaneously among several heirs as under the Mahomedan Law (where the widow, the father, mother, song and daughters of a man take the estate together if they are all alive at the time). Nor did the Hindu system confine the descent to a single person among a group of heirs of the same degree and sex as in the English system before 1926 ( where the eldest son succeeded to the real estate of an intestate person). 

It has further been seen how the ancient and medieval Hindu rules as to debts, adoption, partition and inheritance have been moulded for over a century by Legislation and by decisions of the Privy Council and the Courts in India. Many persons feel that the time has now arrived for the codification of Hindu Law. A Committee presided over by Sir B. N. Rau has prepared a draft code which attempts to codify certain branches of Hindu Law. From several quarters there has been vehement opposition to this draft code. The objections raised are many. It is not possible to deal here with the several objections in detail. But some of them which raise questions of fundamental importance will have to be briefly stated and answered. The first objection is that in view of Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858 the Indian Legislature should not interfere with the oustoms and usages of the people that are part and parcel of the Hindu religious system. But this objection is hollow and unsubstantial and conveniently ignores what has happened during the last hundred years or so. All that the Queen pro claimed was: 'Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity and aoknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We desire it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favoured, none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observances; but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects on pain of our highest displeasure.' Not withstanding the noble sentiments expresged here, the Indian Legislature both before and after the proolamation passed numerous laws that more or less impinged upon or affected the religious theories, sentiments and practices of millions of Hindus! The following is a list of some of the important laws of this character which will convince any one of the fact that 

11) 

Laws affecting ancient Hindu practices 

821 

people have always submitted to laws passed by the Governor General or the Legislature that prevented them from carrying out their cherished ideas and practices : Regulation XVII of 1829 which declared the practice of Sati illegal and a crime punishable by the courts; the Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850 ); Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act ( XV of 1856, which legalises the marriages of Hindu widows notwithstanding any custom or interpretation of the Hindu Law to the contrary); the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860, which makes sexual inter course by a man with his own wife that is under thirteen years of age punishable as rape ); the Child Marriage Restraint Act (XIX of 1929), which makes the marriage of a male below 18 and of a female below 14 punishable as a crime; the Hindu Inheri tance (Removal of Disabilities) Act (XII of 1928) which sets aside the Mitākṣarā rules about exclusion from partition and inherit ance except in the case of those that have been lunatics or idiots from birth; the Hindu Law of Inheritance Amendment Act ( II of 1929, which enables the son's daughter, daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son to succeed under the Mitākṣarā in that order after the paternal grandfather and before & father's brother); the Hindu Gains of Learning Act ( XXX of 1930 ); the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (XVIII of 1937, which enables the widow of a deceased member of a joint Hindu family to succeed to the interest of her husband in the joint family property and to succeed to her deceased husband's separate property for the same share as that of a son). The Privy Council claimed more than 70 years ago that the British Government by virtue of its sovereign power asserted, as the former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit endowments of this kind ( viz. temples) and to provent and redress abuses in their management' ( Rajah Muttu Ramalinga v. Perianayagum 1 1. A. 209 at p. 232 ). Non-Hindu Judges of the Privy Council and the High Courts have been interpreting and laying down the Hindu Law for over a hundred years and on many points the law declared by them has thoroughly changed the law of the smrtis and digests. If all this has been allowed to happen without hardly & demur, there is apparently no satisfactory or convincing reason why an elected Indian Legisla ture the majority of whose members are likely to be Hindus should not pass an Aot dealing with Hindu Law. 

Another objection raised oven by some retired judges of the High Court is that the present system of laying down the822 

History of Dharmatāstra 

( Vol. 

Hindu Law by means of judicial decisions is quite satisfactory and there is no need of a code of Hindu Law. This objection merely shows that change is rather a painful process for most mon. The present method may be a veritable El Dorado or paradise for lawyers and busy bodies fonenting longdrawn litigations. One must stand appalled at the colossal expendi ture of time, labour and money which must have been involved during the last hundred years or more in fighting out doubtful points of Hindu Law from the lowest court to the Privy Council. It not unfrequently happens that after a point had been settled by a Full Bench decision of a High Court and after common people and lawyers had followed the law thus settled for fifty years the Privy Council upsets the decision on an appeal by an enterprising litigant. For example, the Bombay High Court decided in 1879 in Ramji 1. Ghamau (6 Bom. 498 ) that the adop tion by the widow of a deceased co-parcener, who had not her husband's express authority to adopt, was invalid, if made with out the consent of the surviving co-parceners. But in 1932 the Privy Council held that Ramji v. Ghamau was wrongly decided and that a widow can adopt without her husband's express authority and even in the teeth of the opposition of the sur viving members of her husband's family. And when an appeal was made to the principle of 'stare decisis' the Privy Council was pleased to observe, ' It was pressed on their Lordships that Ramji v. Ghamau had been accepted and acted upon in the Presidency of Bombay since 1879 and that the decision should not be disturbed. But this is a belated appeal. It should have been made when Yadav v. Namdeo was before the Board.' To ordinary minds this dictum, speaking with the utmost régpect, appears strange. If for some reason or other a certain line of argument is not placed before the Privy Council by the counsel of a private party and a wrong decision is given, is it to be supposed that all litigants are to be precluded from trying to get the wrong decision right for all time to come! The Privy Council has not seldom set right a wrong decision given by the Board in a prior appeal. In Sahu Ram v. Bhup Singh 44 I. A. 126 the Privy Council held that the pious duty of the son to discharge his father's or grandfather's debts does not attach while the father or grandfather is alive; but in Brý Narain v. Mangla Prasad 51 I. A. 129 the Privy Council held (at p. 134) that the pious duty is always there irrespective of the question whether the father or grandfather is alive or dead.

Draft Hindu code , 

823 

Others opine tbat one Code for the whole of India is not and cannot be a practicable proposition. In support of their objection they rely on the existence of the several schools of law now prevalent in the whole of India. If India desires to be a self-governing political unity in the future, there is a com pelling reason why it should be governed by a single Code of Hindu Law, as it has been gov erned and will be governed in other substantial provinces of law by codes applicable to all alike. That will help in the direction of solidarity and will be of some use in doing away with fissiparous tendencies. There are really only two schools of Hindu Law. And the unification of Hindu Law will be helped by the abolition of the right by birth which is the cornerstone of the Mitakṣarā school and which the draft Hindu Code seeks to abolish. Many people are vehemently opposed to the change. But they forget that: what with the rule that any member of a joint Hindu family may alienate his interest for value, what with the Gains of Learning Act, the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act and other enactments, the real core of the ancient Hindu family system has been removed and only the outer moribund shell remains (vide p. 604 above). Some are opposed to giving along with sons a share to daughters, particularly to married daugh ters. But here a compromise may be effected by allowing a share to unmarried daughters alone (as Yāj. II. 124 and the Mitākṣarī thereon expressly provide ). 

Another provis ion in the draft Hindu Code which has come in for severa anim adversion is the provision that a woman even when taking by inheritance an estate from a male or by partition should be held to become absolute owner thereof. In the first place, if a man's agnate of the 13th degree or a male cognate up to the 5th degree takes an estate absolutely and may squander it away as he pleases, one fails to see why his own widow should not have a like power in the 20th century, what ever may have been the view of ancient works. In the second place, this objection can be met by means of a compromise, viz. that a widow inheriting her husband's estate will take only a limited estate if at the time of her husband's death any one of the compact series of heirs or any direct lineal descendant of her husband (such as a son's daughter or daughter's daughter) be alive, but she will take an absolute estate if none of these exists. Such a compromise should allay all fears about the widow unfairly disposing of the estate against near relations 

824 

History of Dharmadastra 

( Vol. 

like the daughter or daughter's son or husband's brother &c. There are numerous other objections, but they are in matters of detail and if once it is agreed that there should be a Code of Hindu Law passed by the Indian Legislature these matters of detail may be adjusted to the satisfaction of most people. 

Similarly serious objections are raised to the provisions of the Code as regards marriages and divorce. The draft code proposes to do away with the prohibitions based on sameness of gotra and pravara. This is a desirable change and being optional should not be opposed. Some reasons for this change have been advanced in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 498. Besides, this provision will affect only a small percentage of the Hindu popu. lation. Similarly the insistence on monogamy is opposed by many. In this case some compromise may be arrived at as regards classes to whom two wives are an economic advantage. The provisions about divorce have been overdue. Among the higher castes no divorce has been allowed on any ground what ever. Many hard cases occur where there is no redress and the draft code proposes to give relief in such cases. 

On the most contentious subject of adoption the draft code, it is satisfactory to note, has made certain provisions which are in line with the suggestions put forth by me in note 1338a above. 

Compelling reasons exist why Hindu Law should be codi fied as early as possible. Men naturally desire that they should have easy access to the laws by which they are to be governed in all their actions, dealings and relations. It is hardly a commendable or desirable state of things that-people should be forced to consult lawyers or bulky textbooks every now and then and even in small and simple matters. The general outlines and provisions of Hindu Law must be within easy reach of every intelligent or inquiring Hindu. This can only happen if there is a code for all Hindus or, if that is deemed impracticable for the present, at least for a large pro vince or for a number of provinces,
