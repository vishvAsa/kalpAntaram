VYAVAHARA 

(LAW AND ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE) 

CHAPTER XI 

That to administer justice impartially and to punish the guilty were among the prime functions of the sovereign has been stated above (p. 57). The king was deemed to be the fountain (i. e. the distributor ) of justice. Kautilya 323 (I. 19) prescribes that the king was to look into the disputes of citizens and country people in the 2nd part of the day (divided into eight parts ). Manu (VIII. 1-3) states that the king desirous of looking into the disputes of people should enter the sabhā ( the hall of justice ) accompanied by brāhmaṇas, ministers and should there decide every day the causes of litigants. Sukra IV.5.45 is the same as Manu VII. 1, Vas. 16-2, Saṅkha-Likhita, Yāj. I. 327 and II. 1, Vispu Dh. S. II. 72, Nār. (1.2), Sukra IV. 5.5, Mānasollasa II. 20, verse 1243 state that the administration of justice was the personal concern of the king. The Mit on Yāj. II. 1 says that protecting the subjects is the highest duty of a king and that that duty cannot be discharged without eradicating and punishing the wicked, which latter requires that the king should administer justice ( vyavahāradarśana). Medhatithi on Manu VIII. 1 also says that protection consists in the removal of troubles, secular and spiritual (adrsta ). Manu VIII. 12 and 14 ( = Nār. III. 8-9 p. 42) personifies the administration of justice as Dharma incarnate by representing that when justice is administered the dart of adharma or falsehood by which dharma is pierced is taken out from the body of Dharma. Yāj. (I. 359-360) declares that the impartial administration of justice yields the same rewards as solemn vedic sacrifices do. In this way administra tion of justice was held to be a very sacred duty. Manu VIII. 128 ( = Vļddha-Hārlta VII. 194) declares that a king who punishes those that do not deserve to be punished and who does not punish those that deserve punishment incurs great obloquy and goes to hell. Vas. (19.40-43) prescribes one day's fast for the king and three days' fast for the purohita when the king lets off those that deserve punishment and three days' fast for the king and the kṣcchra penance for the purohita when the king

punishes the innocent. The Mahabharata 32s (Anusasana 6:38 and chap.70) and Rāmāyaṇa say that if a king intent on pleasures does not show himself to litigants who approach him for deci sion, he would suffer like king Nrga. The Sukranitisara (IV.5.8) also says the same thing. In the Ramayana (VII. 53-54) king Nṛga is said to have been cursed to become a chameleon for a long period by two brāhmaṇas who had a dispute about the ownership of a cow and could not see the king for many days. Megasthenes (Frag.XXVII. pp. 70-71) says the king remains the whole day in court without allowing the business to be interrupted.' Kaut.325 (I. 19) gives the advice that, when in court, the king should not cause petitioners or litigants to wait long at the door, for when a king makes himself inaccessible, those who are near him create confusion about what should or should not be done, whereby the king engenders disaffection among his subjects and makes himself a prey to his foes. The king's court 326 of justice was called dharmasthāna (Saṅkha Likhita.), dharmāsana (Narada I. 34, Manu VIII. 23, Sukra IV. 5-46 ) or dharmādhikarana ( Kātyāyana and Sukra IV. 5.44 ). * The place where the decision of the truth of the plaint (lit. the cause or root of dispute ) is carried on by a consideration of the rules of the sacred law is called the dharmādhikarana (the Hall of Justice)-says Katyayana. Kalidasa (Sakuntalav) and Bhavabhūti (Uttararāmcarita I.) employ the word dharmāsana* 

The authors of smrtis believed that there was a golden age or era of perfect virtue in the dim past, when men were bent only on right conduct, that later ages saw the advent of sinful

promptings, that therefore regulation of life by the learned and the king came into vogue (compare Gaut. VIII. 1). Manu I. 81-82 ( = Santiparva 231. 23-24) state that in the Krta age dharma prevailed in its perfection, there was no advent of adharma among men then and that in each of the three succeed ing yugas dharma declined progressively by the introduction of theft, falsehood and deceit. The Sāntiparva ( 59. 13 ff) narrates that in the Krta age there was no king and no punishment, that gradually kāma (lust) and rāga (passion) began to wield sway and dharma dwindled away. This belief in an ideal or porfect past was universal and was probably depicted in order to indeve mon to rise higher and higher in goodness and virtuo and to make them submit easily to the discipline of government and the priestly requirements. This ideal description of the past is often found associated with the picture of anarchy that reigned in the dim past which was retrieved from horrors by the creation of the kingly office ( vide pp. 30-34 above). These diametrically opposite views of the past contained in the same works (such as Manu and the Mahabhārata ) probably owe their origin to the desire of the writers to make the common people submit to the absolute rule of kings. Almost all works even from the Rgveda ( X. 10. 10) downwards believe in the progressive deterioration of religion and morals. A state of anarchy is visualised in a few works only for the purpose of glorifying the great usefulness of the institution of kingship. Nār. I. 1 states 327 'when people were solely bent on dharma and were truthful, there existed neither administration of law and justice nor hatred nor jealousy. When dharma declined ( or disappeared) among men, administration of law and justice came to be introduced and the king was declared to be the decider of disputes and the chastiser (of the guilty )'. Br. also (8. B. E, 33 p. 277) says 'In bygone ages men were pre-eminently virtuous and free from cruel tendencies; now that men are overwhelmed by greed and hatred, judicial procedure has to be declared'... 

The idea of Dharma took the place of the ve.y ancient conception of sta. In the Rgveda fta denotes the supreme

The meaning of sta

transcendental law or the cosmic order by which the universe and even the gods are governed and which is intimately con nected with sacrifice. Vide Rg. I. 68. 2. I. 105. 12, I. 136. 2, I. 142. 7, I. 164. 11, II. 28, 4, IV. 23. 8-10 ( in which the word sta occurs ten times), X. 190. 1. On the relation of rta and law Berolzheimer in his The world's legal philosophies' (translated by Jastrow, New York, 1929 ) says: "closely connected with the religious and philosophical views of the Aryans are certain fundamental positions in regard to the philosophy of law which in turn became the antecedents of later legal and ethical developments among the Greeks and Romans. Foremost among these philosophical conceptions is 'rita', which is at once the organized principle of the universe and the divine ordering of earthly life; as the former it regulates the appearance of the sun and the moon, of day and night and embodies the un changeable principle that pervades the succession of phenomena; as the latter it is affiliated with purpose and human benefit and is exemplified in the flow of the rivers which fertilize the fields; in the cattle useful to men; in the institutions of marriage, of the monarchical state, of the patriarchal home; and in man's sense of responsibility for his sins. The derivative conceptions of vrata ',' dharma ',' dhāma', 'svadha' represent special aspects of 'rita'; thus 'vrata' refers to any specialized embodied 'rita'; while 'dharma' refers specifically to the moral function of rewarding good and punishing evil" (pp. 37-38). Vide Prof. V. M. Apte's paper or "Rta' in the Rgveda (pp. 55-60 of the Silver Jubilee Volume of the Annals of the B. O. R. Institute ) in which he tries to prove that rta means primarily 'the belt of the Zodiao'. 

The word vyavahūra is used in several senges in the sūtras and smṛtis. One meaning of vyavahāra is ' transaction or dealing' as in Udyogaparva 37, 30 quoted above (on p. 207) or in Āp. Dh. S. II. 7.16.17, 1. 6.20.11 and 16. It also means a dispute, a lawn suit' in Santi 69.28, Manu VIII. 1., Vas. 16-1, Yāj. II. 1., Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 72, Nār. I. 1 and %, Sukra IV. 5.5. A third sense is . legal capacity to enter into transactions' (as in Gaut. X. 48, 

246 

History of Dharmasastra 

[ Vol. 

Vas. 16-8, Saṅkha-Likhita (rakṣed rājā bālānām dhanānyaprāpta. vyavahārānām &c. quoted in V. R. p. 599). A fourth but a rare sense is 'the means of deciding a matter' (as in Gaut. XI. 19 * tasya vyavahāro vedo dharmaśāstrāṇyangāni &c.). In this chapter the word vyavahāra is taken to mean law-suit or dispute in a court' and 'legal procedure'. This sense is very ancient. In the Delhi-Topra Pillar Edict No. 1 of Asoka (Corpus I. I. vol. I. p. 123) we have the word 'viyohālasamatā (vyavahārasamatā) and the word 'vyavahāravidhi' occurs in Kharavela's Hāthigumpha Inscription (E. I. vol. XX. p. 79 ). A voharika-mahāmatta' (vyāvahārika-mahāmātra, minister of justice ) occurs in the Mahāvagga, I. 40. 3 and Chullavagga VI. 4.9). In the medieval digests, both law and procedure are sometimes dealt with in one book as in the Vyavahāra-nirnaya of Varadarāja and the Vyavahāra-mayūkha; sometimes the titles of law are treated of in one work and judicial procedure in another. For example, Capdeśvara composed the Vivādaratnākara(on titles of law) and Vyavahāraratnākara ( on judicial procedure). The word vyavahāra is restricted in some works to judicial procedure alone (as in the Vyavahāramātýkā of Jimūtavāhana and the Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana ). The word vivāda which means ' dispute' is often used as a synonym for vyavahāra in the sense of law-guit or legal procedure or both. In Ap. Dh. S. II. 11.29.5 and in Nār. I. 5 vvāda means 'law-suit'. In the Vivādacandra of Misarumiśra and the Vivadatāndava of Kamalakara both law and judicial procedure are treated of. Yaj. (II. 8 and 305 ) appears to distinguish between vivāda (law-suit) and vyavahāra ( judicial procedure). 

The word ' vyavahāra' is defined by several smrtis and com mentators. Kātyāyana gives two definitions, one based on 

etymology and referring principally to procedure and the other giving the conventional sense having in view a dispute. "The (upasarga) v is employed in the sense of various ', 'ava' in the sense of doubt', 'hāra' means ' removing"; vyavahāra' is 80 called because of its removing various doubts" (quoted by V.M. 

III ) 

Definition of Vyavahāra 

247 

p. 283, Par. M. III. p. 7 and Kullūka on Manu VIII. 1 ).377a This definition places the administration of justice on a high plane. The purpose of all branches of Indian philosophy is the quest of Truth or Reality. The purpose of legal procedure is, according to Kāt., the same viz. to find out the truth when there is a dispute. But there are some points of difference. The philosopher may take his own time in his search for truth; but justice has to be done as quickly as possible. Further, legal procedure hag its own method and limitations in finding out the truth, that is, it depends on oral and documentary evidence, while a philoso pher's quest of truth may be purely intellectual and subjective. Another definition is: 'When the ramifications of right conduct, that are together called dharma and that can be established with efforts (of various kinds such as truthful speech &c.), have been violated, the dispute (in a court between parties) which springs from what is sought to be proved (such as a debt), is said to be vyavahāra'. Hārita gives an easier definition:' that is declared to be vyavahāra where the attainment of one's wealth (taken away by another) and the avoidance of the dharmas of others ( such as those of heretics ) are secured with the help of) the means of proof'( quoted by the Sm. C. II. p. 1). The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 1) defines vyavahāra as averment (about a matter) as related to oneself in opposition to another'. Sukra IV. 5. 4 gives another definition. The Vyavahāramayukha gives a much

more elaborate definition ( vide text p. 1 and notes pp. 3-4 of my ed.). 

A vyavahārapada 32 means the topic or subject matter of litigation or dispute'. It is the same thing as 'vivādapada' which word occurs also in Kaut. (III. 16 p. 191 and IV. 7 p. 218) and in Nār. ( dattāpradānika 1, abhyupetyāśuśrūṣā 1). Manu VIII. 8 shows that 'pada' means' sthāna'. Yāj. II. 5 defines it as ' If a person, who is set at naught by others in a manner that is opposed to the rules of smrti and to good usage or conventions, informs the king (or his judge ), that is a vyavahārapada'. From very ancient times eighteen vyava hārapadas have been enumerated. The underlying idea is that most of the disputes between men can be classified under 18 heads. Even Manu ( VII. 8 ) was conscious of the fact that the enumeration of 18 vyavahārapadas was a matter of a convenient arrangement and that the number 18 did not embrace all disputes whatever but only the largest number of disputes and the most important among them. Medhātithi and Kullūka make this position quite clear. 329 

. There is some difference about the number and nomen clature of the vyayahārapadas among Manu and other writers of smṛtis. The following table will give some idea of the divergence as to nomenclature and the sequence in which they are treated of. All do not mention them in the same order as in Manu VIII. 4-7. For example, the order in Yāj. is rṇādāna, upanidhi, dayavibhāga, simā-vivada, svāmipālavivāda, asvami. vikraya &c. Yāj. does not enumerate all of them in one place as Manu and Nārada do.

[Vol. 

It will be noticed that Yāj. omits the duties of husband and wife from the 18 topics of vyavahāra as he had already dealt with them in his section on ācāra, adds abhyupetyasuśrūṣā and prakirṇaka (miscellaneous wrongs ) and splits krayavikrayānu say& into two and thus gives 20 topics. Nārada (I. 16-19 ) has the same 15 topics as those of Manu (in some cases under slightly different names), omits svāmipālavivādā, steya and strisangrahaṇa, adds abhyupetyāśusrūṣā and another topic viz. prakirpaka and splits krayavikrayānusaya into two, viz. krītānu saya and vikrīyāsampradāna. He includes steya under sāhasa (sāhasa verge 21 ) and also in what is an appendix. Bșhaspati as quoted in the Smṛti-candrikā (vyavahāra p. 9) names the 18 vyava harapadas and adds prakirpaka. Kautilya also adds prakirnaka and omits steya' under his dharmasthiya section, though he deals with theft elsewhere ( as in IV. 8 and 11). It is not to be supposed that the 18 topics were first started by the Manusmrti. Gaut. XII. 1 mentions vākpāruṣya and dandapārusya, treats of some of the topics without specifying the technical names e. g. he refers to the subjects of sangrahana ( in XII, 2-3), of theft (XII. 12-13), of svāmipālavivāda (in XII. 16 ff), of rṇādāna (in XII. 26-33), of nidhi (in XII. 39), of dayavibhāga (in XXVIII). Similarly the Ap. Dh. S. speaks in scattered places of some of the topics of vyavahāra such as murder ( i. e. sāhasa ) in 1. 9. 24, of adultery in I. 9. 25. 1-2 and 1. 10. 28. 15-20, II. 10. 26. 18 ff, theft in I. 9. 25. 4-11, dāyavibhāga in II. 6. 14, vākpāruṣya in II. 10. 27. 14. Vas. also mentions the word dāyavibhāga ( in XVII. 40 ) and sets out rules about it and about means of proof (XVI. 13-15), about mādāna (XVI. 31 ), about the twelve kinds of sons (XVII. 12-39). The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 8) employs the word dāyavibhāga and gives several rules on that subject. Thus some at least out of the eighteen vyavahārapadas ( such as vākpāruṣya, dapdapārusya, dāyabhāga, steya ) were distinctly recognized centuries before the present Manusmrti was composed. Someśvara in Mānasollāsa (II. 20. verses 1265-1273) enumerates 22 vyavahārapadas, by splitting dattasyānapākarma into two as datta and dattāpahāraka, adds svāmibhrtyavivāda after svami pālavivāda, counts krayavikrayānusaya as two and dyūta samāhvaya as two distinct topics. 

The definition of vyavahārapada in Yāj. II. 5 ( = Sukra IV. 5. 68) viz. 'if a person informs or complains to the king' (avedayati ced rājne) conveys that vyavahārapada means and includes only those disputes that are started or brought before 

III 1

the Court at the instance of the parties. Manu VIII. 43 pres cribes that neither the king nor his officers should start a dispute (i, e, a legal proceeding), nor should he sit silent upon (hush up) a matter which has been brought before him by another (i, o, by a party ). Gaut. XIII. 27 lays down that a party should humbly approach a judge with his complaint. Katyāyana (27) states: 'The king 330 should not, through influence or through greed of money, take upon himself the disputes of men, when they do not theniselves want to contend (in a court)'. Mānasollāsa IL 20 verse 1274 and Sukra IV. 5. 69 say the same. There must have always been several matters, of which nobody might complain and which the king might have to look into suo motu. Manu after dealing with the 18 vyavahārapadas ( in VIII. 1 to IX, 251 ) requires the king ( in IX. 252-253) to make offorts to destroy kantakas (thorns, harmful persons) and dilates upon many aspects of his activities in this respect. Nārada relegates all matters in which the king took action suo motu to a separate topic, prakirnaka, about which he says ' under prakirṇaka are comprised lawsuits depending on the king (i. e. on the king's own action ) such as transgressions of the king's commandments and obedience to his injunctions, grants of towns, dissensions among the constituent elements (such as ministers) of the State, the duties and breaches there of among heretics, followers of the veda, corporations (of merchants) and groups, dispute between father and son, neglect of prescribed penances, abstraction of gifts made to worthy persons, the wrath of hermits, sinful confusion of castes and the rules regarding their maintenance and ( in short) whatever (matter) has been omitted in the preceding ( vyavahārapadas )--these are treated under prakirpaka '. 331 Bphaspati defines prakirṇaka in

the same way as Nārada. Kautilya deals with the vyavahāra padas in his Dharmasthiya (III) section and in the Kantaka sodhana section (IV) speaks of matters that are similarly dealt with by officers called pradeṣtī8 (who correspond to coronerg and police magistrates of modern times), while matters falling under the dharmasthiya section (viz. the vyavahārapadas ) were disposed off by judges ( called dharmasthas). Kantaka means in Kautilya as in Manu IX, 252 'harmful persons'. The chief matters that fell within the purview of the kantakasodhana (removal or punishment of harmful persons ) officers or courts were : Artisans like blacksmiths and carpenters were generally to work in guilds and receive from people materials for working them up; if they caused unreasonable delay in handing back finished articles, they were to receive one-fourth less than the proper wages and were to be fined twice the amount of wages ; similar provisions are made for loss of wages and fines for Weavers who do not increase the weight of cloth (cotton, linen, silk, or woollen) woven up to the usual standard: washermen were to wash clothes on wooden planks or smooth stones, but if they washed them elsewhere, they were to pay compensation for loss caused and a fine of 6 paṇas; they were to be fined twelve panas for the sale, pledge or hiring out of other's clothes; they were also to be fined for keeping clothes with them beyond the time ordinarily required; for washing the best garments, garments of middling quality and inferior garments the wages were respectively one papa, ) and ; trust worthy persons and experts were to decide disputes about colour and wages; similar rules apply to tailors ; goldsmiths, who 

(Continued from the last page) In an interesting paper contributed to the Sir Denison Ross volume of papers pp. 234-240 Dr. V. Raghavan describes a work called 'Vaisyavamsa sudhakara' composed by Kolācala Mallinātha, the renowned commentatot of the five classical Sanskrit Kāvyas. This work is the report or decision given by a commission presided over by Mallinātha appointed to settle & dispute (which in these days might be called a caste question not cognisable by civil courts) that arose in the times of Devaraya II. of Vidyanagara (1422-1466 A. D.). Vaisyas were given a license to trade in the 24 citics and 108 shrines of the realm; certain subcastes like the Komaṭis claimed to be vaisyas and this privilege also. Mallinātha decides after a searching examination of authorities that the words vaisya, vanik, nagara, ūruja, tṛtiya. jātiya are synonyms, that Komatis, who were styled vijātis by their rivals, were vaisyas and entitled to all the privileges of vaisyas. This decision would come under either parte ... fata: or a TefTTA.

without informing (government officers ) purchased from un clean hands (1. e. from menial servants or slaves ) without changing the form of the article or after changing the form, or purchased from a thief were to be fined respectively 12, 24 or 48 paṇas ; for stealing one ( gold) māṣaka (one-sixteenth of a suvarna ) from off a suvarna, the gold-smith was to be fined two hundred paṇas and for stealing one māsaka out of a silver dharana there was a fine of twelve paṇas ; fines are provided for loss of weight ( beyond the recognised standard) in the case of working up copper, lead, brass, bell-metal, tin into vessels and articles; for manufacturing a counterfeit coin, for accepting it or passing it off to another the fine was a thousand panas and for entering a counterfeit coin in the royal treasury the punishment was death; a physician, who undertook the medical treatment of a patient without informing (government officers) of the dangerous nature of the disease, was to be punished with the first amercement if the patient died and with the middling fine if the patient died through the carelessness of the physician and if the patient suffered some vital injury, the matter was to be dealt with as assault (dandapārusya); musicians and actors shall stay in one place during the rainy season and shall avoid taking excessive gifts or indulging in excessive praise of one patron ; for violating this rule the fine was twelve paṇas. The same rules apply to those who show dumb plays and to other mendi cants, the latter receiving as many lashes as the fine imposed in similar cases on others. In IV. 2 Kautilya prescribes fines against merchants that use false measures, weights and balances ; that sell timber, iron, jewels, ropes, clothes mis representing them as superior when they are inferior ; that conspire to prevent the sale of merchandise; that cause adultera tion of grains, oils, salt, medicines &c.; that raise the prices beyond those fixed by the superintendent of commerce for local commodities and for foreign produce. In IV. 3 Kaut. provides for measures against such calamities as fire, floods, pestilen tial diseases, famine, rats, tigers, serpents and prescribes a fine of twelve papas for catching or injuring cats and mongooses employed to destroy'rats. In IV. 4 Kauṭ, prescribes the measures that the officer called samahartr has to take to protect the subjects against those who prey upon the people secretly by employing foul means. He has to employ spies under various disguises to find out the honesty or corruption of officers in the villages, of superintendents, of judges, of magistrates and witnesses and the punishment in these cases is generally

banishment. Kautilya IV. 5 deals with the detection of young men inclined to robbery and adultery by the employment of spies and agents provocateurs in the guise of ascetics and persons reput ed to possess miraculous powers. The Kauṭillya IV.6 and 7 respec tively describe the seizure of criminals on suspicion or in the very act itself and examination in cases of sudden death. Kaut. IV. 8 speaks of questioning in the presence of the wronged party of the witnesses of the accused, whether they are his relatives or total strangers, as regards the country, the caste, the family, the name, occupation, property, friends and residence of the accused and of the application of torture to the accused to elicit an admission of guilt. It is said that torture is to be applied only in the case of those whose guilt is believed to be established prima facie (āptadoṣam karma kūrayet), that torture is not to be employed when the accused is guilty of a minor offence, is under age, old or diseased, is under the influence of intoxicants, or is a lunatic, or is overwhelmed by hunger or thirst or fatigue due to a journey, or has eaten to excess or is suffering from indigestion or is weak, nor is it to be employed in the case of a pregnant woman or a woman who was delivered of a child within a month; and in the case of other women only half the torture prescribed for males or only the asking of questions is to be employed. Learned brāhmaṇas and ascetics ( when accused) are to be subjected to espionage only. Those who violate these rules or incite others to do so and those who are guilty of causing the death of an accused by torture are to be punished with the highest amercement. Four kinds of torture were employed in the case of complaints about wrongs viz. six dandas, seven whippings, two kinds of suspen sion, and ( fourthly ) water-tube (i. e. injecting salt water in the nose from a tube ). 332 In this chapter Kaut. states that one who 

332. The exact meaning of the four kinds of torture is not clear. Prof. V. R. Dikshitar in 'Hindp Admiaistrative Institutions' pp. 237-247 tries very hard to establish that Kauṭ, recommends no torture in any case, that 'vākyānuyoga' means 'pronouncing of guilt by the jury' and karmūnu. yoga means judgment of the Chief Justice'. Though the learned Professor's attempt to exculpate Kautilya may be due to laudable motives, the words of Kautilya are too clear to admit of any other interpretation than the one given above, If one dispassionately considers the fact that no karma was allowed to be employed in the case of the weak, the diseased, old men &c., that in the case of women 'ardhakarma' alone was allowed, that a heavy fino was imposed for causing death by karma (karmanā vyāpādanena ).

charges an innocent man with being a thief or who conceals & thief is to be punished like a thief and that even one who is not a thief may for fear of torture admit that he is a thief, as Māndavya did. Kaut in IV, 9 prescribes that the samā lart? and pradeṣtrs should exercise control over all superintendents of the various State departments and their subordinates, that those who steal or seize valuable articles or jewels from State mines or manufactories should be simply sentenced to death, prescribes various fines and punishments for stealing or re moving by force articles of different prices from the State granaries and store-houses, provides punishment for judges that threaten, browbeat, send out or unjustly silence or abuse litigants or that do not ask proper questions or ask improper questions, that cause unnecessary delay, unjustly rehear causes that have been heard or disposed of, and provides heavy punish 

(Continued from the last page) that Mandavya, though really not a thief, declared that he was so through the fear of the torments of karna (karmakleśabhayat), that in the four karmas we find suspension and water-tube and that immediately after the words. karnia karayet we get the rule that in all crimes the brāhmana was not to be subjected to bodily pain, it will have to be admitted that 

karma' in this chapter of the Arthasāstra means 'torture'. One fails to see what 'ardhakarma'in the case of women will mean if 'karma' signifies only the judgment of the chief justice or why Mandavya should bave confessed theft through fear of 'karmakleśa'. And one need not feel apologetic if Kautilya recommends torture in certain well-defined cases, Torture was an essential part in tbe Roman Criminal Procedure and Augustus had issued an edict about it. Vide Stephens'. History of English Criminal Law' vol. I, pp, 47-49. Torture by the police and third-degree methods are not unknown in the 20th century in the West (even apart from the latest German methods) or in India, though they are not expressly mentioned in any text-book or Act as allowable. Vide Harry E, Barnes' 'Story of Punish ment' pp. 10-15 for various kinds of tortures employed in the West for several centuries and third-degree methods (pp. 15-24), which be asserts are even now in almost universal use by the Police Department in the U. S. A. The story of Māndavya who though not a thief was held to be a thief, because he, owing to his vow of silence, did not reply whes questioned and near whom was found the booty stolen and who was impaled, is found in Adi. 63. 92-93 (cr. ed. chap. 57). Adi, 107–108 (cr. ed. chap. 101 ), Anusāsana 18. 46-50 and is Nār, (I. 42) and Br. quoted by Aparārka (p. 599). शूले मोतः पुराणपिरचोरचोरशङ्गया। अणीमाष्य इत्येवं विख्यातः सुमहायशाः ॥ आदि 63. 92-93. Kaut. IV. 8 appears to have had a different version of the story before him, The Mārkandeyapurāṇa chap. 16 has the story of Animāndavya. The story of Māndavya was a leading case, it appears, in criminal law. The Mṣcchakatika ( Act IX. 36 ) appears to refer to torture,

ments for releasing persons jailed or for rape on a woman in a look-up. Kaut. IV. 10 prescribes alternative punishments of fines in lieu of the cutting off of fingers or mutilation of limbs for several offences such as theft or assault, abuse and defamation or showing contempt to the king by riding his horse or other conveyance or fabricating royal orders, prescribes death for selling human flesh, simple death or highest amercement for stealing images of gods or animals, for abducting human beings or for wrongfully seizing fields, houges, gold, gold coins, jewels and crops. Death with or without torture is provided for in Kaut. IV, 11 for murdering a man in a quarrel (but when the wounded man dies a fortnight or a month after the quarrel, highest fine or fine of five hundred paṇas and the expenses of medical treatment); different kinds of punishments are provided for wounding with a weapon, impalement for causing violent death of men and women, burning alive for those who aim at securing the kingdom or force entrance into the royal harem or incite wild tribes or enemies or instigate disaffection in the capital or country or army, drowning (or solitary confinement in a dark room, acc. to another reading ) for a brahmana offender of this sort, cutting of tongue for insulting or abuse of parents or a teacher or an ascetic, drowning for one destroying the dam of a tank or for a poisoner or for a woman murdering a man, tearing to death by bulls for a woman who murders her husband or child or her elders or administers poison or sets fire. Kaut. adds that the punishment of death with torture has been prescribed by ancient smrti-writers, but that it is proper to order simple death in cases of offences in which no cruelty enters. Kaut. IV. 12 starts by declaring that no man shall have sexual intercourse with a woman (not his wife ) against her will, prescribes different punishments for forcible sexual intercourse with an immature girl or a girl that has attained maturity, of the same caste, or of a different caste, provides that for inter course with a willing maiden the fine will be 54 panas for the man and 27 for the maiden, further provides that it is no offence for a man of the same caste to have intercourse with a maiden who has not been got married for three years after the appearance of menses, provides fines for deceitfulness in substitut ing one girl at marriage while showing another before, provides that if a woman whose husband is gone abroad commits .adultery a relative or servant of the husband may keep her under restraint and that if the husband on his return forgives the woman her paramour may not be proceeded against,

Kautilya on punishments

but if he does not condone, the nose and ears of the woman may be cut off and the paramour should be sentenced to death. Kaut. IV. 13 provides punishment for brāhmaṇas eating or drinking what is forbidden to them and varying fines for administering forbidden food or drink to members of the four varnas, provides fines for house-trespass and lurking house-tres pass by night, provides punishments for witchcraft, provides burning alive in a vessel for adultery with the queen and other punishments for adultery with women of the several castes, whether guarded or unguarded, prescribes a fine of 24 papas for adultery with a nun. 

The above is a meagre summary of Kautilya's section on kaptakasodhana. Kautilya is encyclopaedic on this subject as on several others. The number of offences dealt with by him is very large and his treatment in some respects compares favourably with such modern criminal codes as the Indian Penal Code, Many of the provisions contained in Kaut. IV are found in Yaj. (II. 273-304), in Nārada (in prakirṇaka and elsewhere) and also in Manu (e. g. VIII. 365-368 about rape or adultery, VIII. 396-97 about washermen and weavers, IX. 225-226 about musicians and dancers, IX. 231-232, IX. 261-267). Why Kaut. treats of several offences under kantakasodhana and not under the dharmasthiya section, it is somewhat difficult to say. It is probable that he included under dharmasthiya only those complaints or actions that were fought out between the parties, even though many of the wrongs complained of under vākpārusya, danda pārusya, sangrahana and steya were criminal and the same as those treated of in the section on kantakaśodhana. In wrongs dealt with in the kantakasodhana section it was the king or king's officers who themselves brought up the offenders for punishment and the offences were viewed not as mere private matters, but as matters in which the State was concerned for the eradication of crime in general. Kautilya in III. 20 speaks of prakirnaka but therein he seems to include some miscellaneous matters like non-return of borrowed articles or deposits ( at the proper time and place), evading payment of ferry tax under the pretence of being a brāhmaṇa, connection with a public woman kept by another, misappropriating revenue collected as agent for a householder, a cāṇdāla's touching an Arya woman, invit ing for dinner in honour of Gods and Manes Buddhist or Ajivaka or Sudra mendicants, abandonment of parents, child, wife or husband, brother or sister, teacher or pupil (when not

guilty of a grave sin), wrongful confinement of a person &c. Kautilya does not apparently include under prakirṇaka all matters in which the king acts suo motu as Nār., Bṛ, and Kāt. do but includes these latter under kantakaśodhana. He, how ever, states here and there (IV. 1 and 13) that the matters dealt with under kantakasodhana are quite analogous to those under such titles as daṇdapāruṣya treated of under the dharmasthiya section. For example, in IV. 1. he says that if a physician through negligence causes loss of a vital part to a patient then the matter may be treated as daṇdapārusya. 333 So Kautilya probably represents a much earlier stage of judicial administra. tion than Nār. or Br., who included under prakirpaka all matters in which the king acted of his own motion (i. e. all that falls under kantakasodhana in Kaut.). 

The enumeration of vyavahārapadas is very ancient and authoritative, but there is hardly any scientific principle of classification underlying them. A writer called Nibandha nakāra quoted in the Sarasvativilāsa 34 (p. 51) holds that in all the vyavahārapadas from mạādāna to dāyavibhāga the relief claimed is something to be given or rendered (deya) by one party to the other, while in vākpāruṣya, dapdapārusya, sābasa, gambling and betting the principal relief is in the form of danda (punishment). Here there is a glimmering of the dis tinction between civil and criminal litigation. Two deep-seated principles in the administration of law and justice everywhere are 'fulfil your promises' and 'cause injury (himsā) to no one'. It is therefore that we find Bșhaspati stating that lawsuits are of two kinds according as they originate in (demands about) wealth or in injuries. Yāj. II. 23 speaks of arthavivāda (civil dispute) and so made a distinction between civil and criminal disputes. Lawsuits * originating in wealth are divided into

fourteen sorts and those originating in injuries are of four sorts These last are vākpārusya (defamation and abuse), dandapārusya (assault and battery), sāhasa (murder and other forms of violence) and strisangraha (adultery). Here there is a clear distinction made between civil disputes (arthamula or dhanamūla) and criminal ones ( hitsa-mūla). Kāt, also says that disputes have their source in two viz. not rendering what should be given and injury (hiṁsā). Though in this way a distinction was made between civil and criminal disputes among the 18 titles of law, it appears that the set of rules and the procedure in both were the same (except as to the time allowed for reply, as to the qualifica tions of witnesses and as to proxies), the same courts tried both kinds of disputes and not as in modern times when civil disputes are tried in one class of courts and criminal complaints in another and when the procedure also in both differs a great deal). There were not two sets of courts in ancient India as there were in England before the fusion of Law and Equity, but all courts in ancient and medieval India were required to administer the law of the texts tempered by common sense and reason as laid down by Bṛ.: 'a decision should not be given by merely relying on the text of the sastra; when consideration of a matter is divorced from reason and common sense loss of dharma results' (g. by Aparārka p. 599). 

Nār. (I. 8-29), Bp., Kāt., the Agnipurana ( 253, 1-12 which reproduce almost verbatim the verses of Nār.) and others predicate several things about vyavahāra, such as that it is dviphala ( has two results ) and so on. All these are brought together here below for convenience. Vyavahāra is :

Among the verses at the end of IV. 1 of the Arthasāstra the follow ing two verses occur: **** 2 EETTE Å TIETTI Parrut: TTATA: पूर्वबाधकः तत्र सत्ये स्थितो धर्मों व्यवहारस्तु साक्षिषु।चरित्रं संग्रहे पुंसां राज्ञामाज्ञातु शास 971. These two occur in Nār. (I. 10-11) and Harita (q. in S. V. p. 58) with variations, viz. both read चतुष्पाद व्यवहारोपमुत्तर पूर्व० and चरित्र पुस्तकरणे. Par. M. III, p. 10 reads arts a French. Lengthy explanations of these verses are offered in Aparārka (p. 597), Smsticandrikā (II. pp. 10-11), Vyavahāra prakasa (pp. 7, 88–89) and other digests. It has to be noted that the four (dbarma &c.) mentioned in these verses are the means of arriving at a decision in a law-suit, as Bṛ. says: UAU &Tugirar for TTATI 041tt fra: hardArrufa: (in Fyra T.

and Br. they are the plaint, the reply, the proof (kriya) and decision (nirnutya) or acc. to Kāt. 31 (q. by Aparārka p. 616) plaint, reply, prutyākalita 337 and kriya. 

Dharma and the other three are really the four feet of nirnaya (final decision), which is one of the four stages of a law-guit (vyavahāra) and so only in a secondary or far-fetched sense they are the four pādas of vyavahāra. Each of these four is said to be of two kinds. Vide Sm. C. II. pp. 10-11, Par. M. III. pp. 198–199, V. P, pp. 87-88 where the verses of Bṛ. are set out and fully explained. A decision is said to be arrived at according to dharma when the wrong-doer admits his guilt or wrong-doing and the real owner secures his wealth or the relief due to him without having to undergo the trouble of a protracted trial by means of witnesses, documents &c. Similarly a decision to be arrived at by ordeals is said to be one by dharma. Dharma and satya are often identified (vide note 125 above) and here the wrong-doer tells the truth and the decision is therefore said to be by dharma. When a litigation is fought out in Court by citing witnesses, the decision is said to be by vyavahāra. "Witnesses' are mentioned only by way of illustration (and imply docu ments, possession and other means of proof). When a defendant is guilty of not giving a straight reply or when his reply is tainted with faults and so is unacoeptable and a decision is given against him on that ground alone it is still a decision by vyavahāra. Caritra means 'the usages of a country, village or family' ( desasthitih pūrvakītā caritram sumudāhrtam --Vyāsa q. in Sm. C. II. p. 11 and Vy. Nir. p. 138). This seems to be the sense of 'caritra' in 'phalakavāre charitratoti' occurring in Nasik Inscription No. 12 in E. I. vol. VIII, p. 82. In prakirnaka 24 Nār. seems to give the same sense 'sthityartham prthivipālais. caritravisayāḥ kṣtāḥ' Caritra also means ' anumāna '(posses sion and presumptions). 'Anumānena nirnitam caritramiti kathyate'-says Br. quoted in Vy. Nirpaya p. 139 and Par. M. III. p. 198. Usages are the means of decision in certain cases apart from the question whether they are supported by the smrtis or 

337. Pratyākalita means, acc. to Aparārka p. 616, the deliberation of the judge and sabhyas as to where the burden of proof (onus probandi) lies and as to the method of proof. Acc. to the Mit. on Yāj. 11. 8, pratyākalita in this sense is not a vyavahārapāda, since it is not directly related to the litigants. Acc. to Nār. II. 21 pratyākalita seems to mean an addition to the plaint or to the reply (i.e. a supplementary written statement), aerat लिखिताभोषं परपुनवादिना स्मृतम् । तत्प्रत्याकलितं नाम स्वपादे तस्य लिख्यते ॥.

The four pūdas of vyavahāra

not. 'Caritram pustakarane' means that such usages are valid means of decision if they have been written down or recorded by the king, while 'caritram tu svikaraṇe' (the reading in Par. M.) means ' usages become the rule of decision when they are accepted as valid by the people and by the courts'. When a king issues in a matter of dispute an order which is not opposed to smrtis or local usages and which is thought out as the most appropriate one by the king's intellect or which is issued to decide a matter when the authorities on each of two sides are equally strong, it is a decision by royal command. Br. ( in Par, M. III. p. 148 ) and Kāt. (verses 35-38 q. in Sm. C. II. p. 10, Par. M. III. pp. 16-17, V. P. p.7) explain the above four. Bphaspati gives two meanings of caritra: (1) what is decided by inference ; () the usages of a country. When it is said that each later one of the four stultifies each preceding one, the idea is not that in all cases it is so, but that it is so only in some cases. Vide Kāt. ( 43 g. by V. P. p. 90 ) which makes this clear. Some examples may be given. If one litigant says that he would prove his case by an ordeal, while the other says that he will prove his contention by human means ( documents or witnesses &c.), then the trial by ordeal is not to be resorted to but the hearing of the case is to proceed in the ordinary way. Vide Kāt. 218 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 22 ) for this rule. Here dharma is set aside in favour of vyavahāra. Another example is given in the Par. M. III. p. 18. A person belonging to one of the four varnas commits a seditious act (rājadroha) and through timidity admits his guilt ( this is satya ), but the witnesses ( relying on Manu X. 130 that where the punishment would be death, a witness may tell a lie ) deny that he was guilty of the act and he is let off. Here dharma is set aside in favour of vyavahāra (trial based on the depositions of witnesses). Vide Sm. C. (II. p. 11 ) for another similar example. In the country of Kerala visiting a prostitute was not condemned by oustom. So even though it is established by witnesses that a person in Kerala did so, the local king may not punish him with a fine. Or suppose a person is charged with the offence of adultery with the wife of au ābhira and this fact is established by witnesses. Yet the man charged may show that among the abhiras there is a usage ( written down in the census records of the king ) that adultery with an abhira woman is not punish able. In such cases caritra (usage ) annuls the (ordinary) vyavahāra. But suppose that in such cases the king, in order to improve the morals of a section of his subjects, issues a262 

History of Dharmasāstra 

(Voi. 

proclamation that from the date of the proclamation one who is guilty of adultery with an abhira woman will be punisbed, then in that case usage will be set aside by royal command, which will then be the rule of decision. Similarly where there are no witnesses nor documents nor possession and no room for ordeal and there are no texts and local usages it is the king who has to decide as best as he can. Vide Pitamaha q. in Sm. C. (IL p. 28). Kāt. (verses 39-43 q. in V. P. p. 89) describes how and when each later one sets aside each prior one. 

Catusthāna-having four bages viz. satya, witnesses, pustakarana and rājaśāsana. 

Catuhsādhana-having four means viz. sūma, dūna, bheda and danda. 

Caturhita--benefitting the four ( the four varṇas and four asramas ). 

Caturvyāpin--that envelopes or reaches four viz. the dis putants, witnesses, the sabhyas and the king. 

Catuṣkārin---that brings about four results viz. dharma ( justice ), gain, renown, love or regard of the people. 

Aṣtānga-.it has eight limbs or members viz., the king, his good officer (chief judge ), sabhyas ( puisne judges ), sastra (law books ), accountant, scribe, gold, fire and water. 

Aṣtādaśapada-has eighteen titles (viz. rṇādāna and others enumerated above). 

Sutaśakha--having a hundred branches. This is approximate. Nās. (I. 20-25 ) states that the 18 titles have 132 sub-heads (rṇādāna 25, upanidhi 6, sambhūyasamutthāna 3, dattā. pradānika 4, aśusrūsā 9, vetana 4, āsvāmivikraya %, vikrsya dāna 1, kritānuśaya 4, samayasyānapākarma 1, kṣetravāda 12, stripumsayoga 20, dāyabhāga 19, sāhasa 12, vākpāruṣya and daṇdapāruṣya 3, dyūtasamābvaya 1, prakirṇaka 6 ).

This latter may take two forms i.e. the grievance of the plaintiff may be negative (e. g. the defendant took or borrowed a debt or article and does not return it ) or positive (e. g. the defendant has dispossessed the plaintiff of land ).338 Vide Mit. on Yāj. II. 5. 

Dvidvāra-having two openings i. e. it is based on the statements in the plaint and those in the reply. 

Dvigati --having two issues, that is, the decision may be founded on truth or on error. 

Dvipada-having two aspects, viz. relating to wealth and so civil (dhanamūla), and relating to injury and so criminal (hiṁsāmūla). This is acc. to Kāt. 29. 

Dvirutthāna “having two springs or sources. It is the same as above. Hārita and Kāt. 30 mention this. 

Duiskandha-having two trunks viz. dharmaśāstra and arthaśāstra (acc. to Kāt. 32). 

Driphala--having two results, victory or failure ( Kāt. 32 ). 

Ekamūla---Hārita and Kāt. mention this. It means 'having only one ( viz. what is to be established) as its root'. 

Sapana and apanamwhere both parties to the litigation or one of the parties stakes (either through pride or anger or belief in the truth of his case ) a certain sum of money to be paid by him in case of his defeat, that is called sapana law-suit ( Yāj. II. 18); in this case the defeated party will pay to the king the usual fine for a defeated party and also the sum staked by him and will deliver to the successful party what is due to him. Vide also Viṣnudharmottara III. 324, 44. A lawsuit may also be apaṇa (without a stake being declared). Nār. (I. 4) employs the words sottara and anuttara for these two.

the complaints of private persons of certain matters called (pa rādhas, padas and chulus and these works set out the lists of ten aparādhas, 22 padas and 50 chalas 339 The king may himself come to know about these or these matters may be brought to his notice by an officer called sūcaka or a private man called stobhaka, defined acc. to Kāt. ( 33-34 ) as follows:- 340 that man is declared to be sūcaku who is appointed by the king himself for finding out the wrong-doings of people and who on coming to know of them conveys them to the king; that man is a stobhaka who with a sole eye to money and without being urged by the king informs the king first of actions (among the people) that are condemned by the śāstras.' Therefore a stobhaka is a private informant for money. The ten aparādhas, acc. to Nār, are: disobedience of the king's order, murder of a woman, confusion of varṇas, adultery, theft, pregnancy from one not the husband, abuse and defamation, obscenity, assault ( danda pārusya), abortion 341. They were called aparādhas because they were met with fine. It will be noticed that some of these come under several vyavahārapadas and some like 'varnasankara' are included in prakirṇaka by Nārada (v.4). The king could by his own action investigate these even if no private complaint he lodged. Samvarta (quoted by the Sm. C. II. p. 28, Par, M. III. pp. 44-45) gives another list which differs in some respects from the above. In the Nalandā copperplate of Devapāladeva (E. I vol. XVII p. 310, p. 321 ) an officer called 'dasāparādhika' is mentioned. In many grants from the 7th century onwards among the taxes remitted to the donees we often meet the ex pression 'together with the ten aparādhas' (sadasāparādbah', in Valabhi grant of Dhruvasena Ill dated saṁyat 334 i. e. 653-4 A.D., E.

Badandadaśāparādhaḥ! (E. I. vol. III p. 53 at p. 56, Torkhede plate of Govinda in sake 735, and E. 1 vol. III p. 263, 266, the Rajor inscription of Mathanadeva dated Vikrama samvat 1016). It is not correct to hold that the words refer to the right of the donee to be exempt from guilt arising from the commission of some traditional offences or that authority was conferred by the grant on the donee to deal with offenders committing the ten aparādhas and to recover the fines imposed by themselves (as suggested in J BORS for 1916 p. 53n). No king would ever think of exempting donees in pious gifts or the villages in those grants from the results of such grave aparādhas as the murder of a woman, adultery, theft and abortion, nor is it possible to hold that a king authorised a private individual or individuals to exercise judicial power in such crimes as murder when (as we shall see later on) the power of dealing with sāhasa was not conferred on sreni or gana tribunals. The real meaning appears to be that the fines levied by him for the commission of the aparādhas in the villages granted would be made over to the donees as part of the gift, when recovered by the king. The 22 vadas were called padas of the king to distinguish them from the vyavahārapadas. According to Pitāmaha 342 they are: ripping open an animal's body (with a sharp weapon), destruction of growing crops, incendiarism, rape of a maiden, concealment of treasure trove, making a breach in an embankment or thorny hedge, grazing cattle over the field of another, destruction of a public garden, poisoning, high treason, unauthorised break ing of the royal seal, divulging the secret line of policy of the king, releasing from jail a prisoner, appropriation of the taxes or fines to be levied by the king ( these are two), appropriating gifts (made by the king) or the utseka

The fifty chalas were mostly breaches of etiquette before the eyes or in the presence of the king. According to Pitamaha they are: obstructing the road, raising the hand threateningly, leaping over a fort-wall ( without permission or reason ), destroying a cistern, destroying a temple, filling up a ditch ( dug round a fort ), divulging the weak points of the king (to the enemy), unauthorized entrance into the harem or royal chamber or the treasury or the royal kitchen (these are four), prying when the king is taking his meals, voiding ordure or urinating or blowing the nose or passing wind in the presence of the king ( these are four ), to sit before the king on haunches (paryankāsana), to occupy the foremost seat in the king's presence, to enter royal presence in a dress more resplendent than the king's or supported by another or by the wrong-daer or at an improper time (these are four), to lie down on the bed or seat of the king or to put on his shoes ( these are three ), to go near the king (unoalled) when the latter is lying down on his bed, to serve the king's enemies, to occupy a seat that is not offered, to use gold in the dress or ornaments (these are two), to take tāmbūla (from the king's betel box ) and chewing it ( this is one ), to speak loudly without being asked (by the king ), to run down the king, to wear only one garment, to appear before the king with oil on the hair, to untie the hair ( before him ), to cover one's face, to have a body painted with figures, to wear a garland, to shake one's garment, to cover the head, to be bent on finding the weak points of the king, to be thick with evil men (or to touch the king ), to have dishevelled hair, pointing out the nose, the bars and the eyes ( these are three ), to pick the teeth, to cleanse the ear or the nose ( these are two). As the list of chalas is a very long one the verses are not quoted below, but are given in the Appendix (note 34% a). Sukra (IV, 5.73-88 ) quotes all the verses from Narada and Pitāmaha on the aparādhas, padas and chalas and in III, 6 also gives a list of ten sins, which is different from that of the aparādhas.

divide the vyavahārapadas into civil and criminal. They more or less deal with most of the subjects brought out in modern classifications but not in an orderly manner They also divide laws into substantive and adjeotive or procedural. The vyava harapadas correspond to the former and the rules about procedure, the appointment of Judges and the constitution of courts, evidence and limitation are adjective law. Some of these are dealt with in the commentaries and digests under a section called vyavahāramātīkā (the elements of judicial proce dure ) and the rules of evidence are stated in Yāj., Nār, and others under the vyavahārapada ļṇādāna once alone. It would be more convenient to deal with adjective law first. That law is now of antiquarian or academic interest only and will there fore be treated somewhat briefly. The smrtis lay down a high level of judicial procedure, but the procedure must have been modified to suit the requirements of different times and the resources and inclinations of different kings. Some of the vyavahārapadas viz. mnādana ( recovery of debt ), strīpunsayoga and dāyabhāga (partition of heritage) are of great practical importance even now, as all Hindus are governed in matters of partition, inheritance, debts, marriage and sonship by the rules of Hindu Law gathered from the Smṛtis and digests as modified by legislative enactments and judicial decisions. For descrip tion of Judicial administration in the Buddhist texts and times, vide Fick pp. 107, 111-112 ( which show that the administration of justice in Vesāli, the capital of the Licchavis, was a complicated affair, one of the courts being that of the atthakulakas i. e, of eight heads of families ), Jayaswal's 'Hindu Polity', part II pp. 156-157, Hiouen Thsang's account in Beal's B.R. W.W. Vol. I. pp. 84-85; and Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. 24 pp. 266-267 (for the administration of Justice under the Marathas ). 

Justice was to be primarily dispensed by the king. He was an original court as well as an appellate tribunal. Smrtis and digests insist that the king cannot dispense justice by him self alone, but must do so with the help and guidance of others. Manu VIII 1-2 and Y&j. II. 1 provide that the king wearing no gaudy dress or ornaments is to enter the sabha (the Hall of Justice ) for looking into the causes of litigants, accompanied by learned brāhmaṇas and ministers proficient in statecraft, is to be free from hot temper and greed and decide according to the law laid down in dharmaśāstras. Kāt. (55-56 quoted in V. M. p. 278, Mft. Op Yāj. II. 2) says the same thing and adds that 

Justice, the king's conceitinh

a king who examines disputes in the presence of the Judge, the ministers, learned brāhmaṇas, the purohita and the sabhyas attains heaven. Vide Sukra IV. 5. 5 to the same effect (taking half verses from Yāj. and Kāt.). The king was not to decide by himself but was to follow the advice of his judge, though the responsibility even when he took advice was the king's. Vide Sukra IV, 5.6 (naikah pasyecca kāryāni). Nār. I. 35 says that the king has to abide by the view of the judge (prāduiva kamate sthitah). This sentiment that it is not safe for a single man, however clever he may be, to undertake to decide a dispute was so ingrained among all people that Kālidāsa gives expres sion to it in the Mālavikāgnimitra (Act I) when he pens the sentence 'sarvajñasyāpyekākino nirpayābhyupagamo doṣaya'. In Raghuvamsa 17.39, Kālidāsa states that king Atithi always looked into the causes of people himself with the help of judges (dharmastha) 34. Pitamaha 345 states that a person even if he knows the rules (of dharma) should not give a decision single handed. Justice was to be dispensed openly in the court and not secretly. Sukra (IV. 5. 6-7) states 346 that neither the king nor the judge nor the sabhyas were to hear a cause in secret and that there were five reasons that led to the charge of partiality in judges viz. hot temper, greed, threats, enmity and hearing disputes in private. Judicial action is divisible into two pro vinces, viz. that of law and that of fact. The latter is a field in which it is impossible to lay down rules for determination. On points of facts there was a vast scope for the king's or judge's discretion. And therefore the texts contented themselves by saying that the king or judge should keep an open or impartial mind, should be free from hot temper or greed, should hear causes under the glare of public view and should not decide at his own will alone but with the help of learned brāhmanas and sabhyas. As regards points of law the king or judge is

required to decide according to the rules of dharmasastra (Manu VII. 3., Yāj. II. 1, Nār. I. 37, Sukra IV. 5. 11) and where there are no texts the king should decide in accordance with the re cognized custom of the country. Kāt. solemnly warns 34? the king against legislating or deciding according to his own will in the face of the texts: “If a king decides (a case) by his own fiat where there is a text (of the śāstra applicable to it) it leads him away from heaven, it causes ruin to the people, it brings danger ( to the king ) from the armies of his foes and it strikes down the roots of (long) life; therefore a king should decide the causes of people according to the rules of śāstra ; but in the absence of smrti texts he should carry out (judicial adminis tration) according to the usages (lit. the views) of the country'. These are the same as Sukra (V. 5. 10-11). Kāt. further pres cribes that the usages established in a country by the approval of its people and that are not in direct conflict with Veda and Smrtis should be recorded in writing under the seal of the king. Pitamaha 348 quoted by the Sm. O. (II. p. 26) states that in certain cases it is the king's own mind that is the deciding 

factor. 

How the king directly dispensed justice is illustrated by the rules of Gaut. XII. 40-42 and Manu VIII. 314-316 that a thief who has stolen a brāhmaṇa's gold may run with dishevelled hair to the king carrying an iron club or a heavy bludgeon of khadira wood, may declare the sin committed by him and request the king to award punishment, that the king may then strike him with the club and that whether the thief dies or lives after the king so strikes him he becomes free from the guilt. The king was also the highest court of appeal. The Rājatarangini (VI. 14-41) states how king Yasaskara heard the appeal of a person who had sold his house without the well, who on returning

from a long absence abroad found the well usurped by the vendee and was defeated in the lower courts because the vendee had bribed the scribe to write 'kūpasahita' instead of'ktiparahita' and how the king decided in the man's favour by exposing the vendee with a trick; while in VI. 42-69 the same king is said to have reversed another decision about a contract by a man whose 100 coins had fallen into a well. The same work in another place (IV. 82-108) states how a brāhmaṇa wife appealed to the king of Kashmir to find out the culprit who had murdered her husband in his sleep and how the king by superhuman means held a sorcerer to be the murderer. 

When owing to pressure of other weighty business the king cannot attend to the work of administering justice, the king should appoint a learned brāhmana together with three sabhyas to decide the disputes of people. Vide Manu VIII. 9-10, Yāj. II. 3, Kāt. 63 349 (same as Sukra IV. 5. 12). The qualifica tions of a judge are set out in many places. Ap. 350 Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 5 prescribes that in law-suits judges shall be endowed with learning, good family, and should be old, clever, and careful about dharma. Nār. requires : ' The Judge should be proficient in the texts on the eighteen titles of law, their 8000 sub-heads, in logic (ānvikṣiki) and should be master of the Veda and Smṛtis. Just as a physician takes out from the body an iron dart by the employ ment of surgical instruments, so a judge should extricate from a law-suit the deceit (underlying it)!. 351 Kāt. says that a judge should be restrained, born of a good family, impartial, not repellent (or harsh in his manners ), steady, afraid of the next world, highly religious, assiduous and free from hot temper. A fine enumeration of the qualities required in a judge is given in the ancient drama Mșcchakatika ( LX. 4). Vide Mānasollāsa

"R. p. 18), 352 or dharma pravaktr ( Manu VIII. 20) or dharmādhikarin (as in Manasollasa II. 2. verse 93). Pradvivāka is an ancient word. It occurs in Gaut. XIII. 26, 27 and 31, Nar.53 (I. 35), Brhaspati (q. by Apararka p. 602). The word is a combination of 'prad.' (one who puts questions to the suitors, from the root pracch ') and * vivāka' (who speaks out or analyses the truth, from the root * vac' with 'vi'). The derivation is given by Nār., Bphaspati, Kāt. 68 and others. The word 'praśnavivāka' (which is quite close to prād vivāka in sense and etymology ) goes very far into antiquity and occurs in Vāj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai. Br. IIJ. 5. 6. The existence of the word prādvivāka as early as Gautama (about 500 B.C.) and of prasnavivaka in the Vaj. S. and Tai. Br. clearly establishes that in anoient India judicial functions became separated very early from executive or political functions. 

The chief Judge was preferably to be a learned brāhmana (Manu VIII. 9, Yaj. II. 3). Kat. (67)354 and Sukra IV. 5.14 prescribe that, if a learned brāhmaṇa cannot be had for the post of the chief judge, then a kṣatriya or a vaiśya who knows the

Who was to be a judge 

273 dharmasastras may be appointed, but the king should carefully avoid appointing a sūdra as a judge. Manu VIII. 20 says that the king may prefer a brāhmaṇa who is not learned and main tains himself by the more fact of his caste, but should never have a śūdra as the expounder of dharma and that the country whose king has a sūdra as judge to expound dharma comes to ruin as a cow sinks in mud. Vyāsa (q. in S. V. p. 65 ) is to the same effect. Manu (VII. 10-11), Yāj. (II. 3;), Nār. (II. 4) and Sukra IV. 5. 17 state that the king should appoint at least three sabhyas ( puisne judges or members of the court of justice ) to associate with the Chief Judge in the disposal of suits ( the idea being that three are the least number of sabhyas to be appointed). Kaut. (II. 1) prescribes that the courts called ' dharmasthiya' should be manned by three judges called dharmasthas who should possess the qualifications and status of amātyas and that such courts should be established on the borders of the provinces, for a group of ten villages ( sairahana), for a district ( dronamukha, 400 villages) and provinces ( sthaniya, 800 villages ). Bphaspati says 35 that the sabhyas may be seven, five or three. As in the case of the chief judge, the sabhyas should be preferably brāhmaṇas, but they may be ksatriyas or vaisyas. Manu ( VIII. 11 ) and Br. say that when in a sabhā three brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas sit along with the chief judge appointed by the king that is like the sabha of Brahmā or it is like a sacrifice. Yāj. II. 2, Viṣnudharmasūtra III. 74, Kāt. 57, Nār. III. 4-5, Sukra IV. 5. 16-17 and others require the following qualifications in the sabhyas: they should be endowed with the study of the Vedas, should know dharma śāstra, should speak the truth, should be impartial to friend or foe, should be steady, devoted to their work, intelligent, here ditary, proficient 356 in arthaśāstra. Impartiality in the king and the judges is insisted on in the texts. Vide Vas. 16. 3-5, Nār. (I. 34, III. 5). The king was not to appoint as sabhyas those who were ignorant of the usages of the country, who were atheists and devoid of the study of śāstras, who were either puffed up, hot-tempered, greedy or distressed (Br. g. in Sm. C.

II. p. 15). The chief justice (prādvivāka) with the sabhyas constituted the Court, being appointed ( niyulta) by the king. It was stated above that the king was to enter the Hall of Justice with the chief justice, sabhyas and brāhmaṇas. The distinction is that sabhyas were appointed by the king as judges, while brāhmaṇas were persons who were well-versed in dharmaśāstra, who could attend the Court, though not appointed (aniyukta ) and whose opinions on difficult points of law were respectfully received by the judges. They (the learned brahmaṇas ) were in the position of amicus curiæ, All and sundry were not to intermeddle in trials before the court, but only those who were learned in dharmaśāstra were allowed to express their opinions on knotty points. Vide 357 Mit. on Yāj. II. 2. Manu VIII. 12-14 ( same as Nār. III. 8-10 in a different order ) say that either a person should not enter a sabhā or if he enters should say what is proper, that a man remaining silent or declaring what is false becomes a sinner and that, where in spite of the opinion of some or all sabhyas, justice is not done by the king, they become participators in the king's guilt. Kāt. (74-78) makes it the duty of the sabhyas to bring round a king gradually to the right path when the king is about to start on the path of injustice and to state the true decision. 358 In the case of the brāhmaṇas their duty ends with stating the rule according to the śāstras; they have not, like the sabhyas, to prevent the king from doing the wrong thing or to bring him round to the path of right and justice. Nār. (III. 1) states elsewhere that one who is not appointed by the king should not interfere by his speech in the decision of a case and that if he does so he would be fined. This applies to the people that are present in the court to see the trial or that accompany the litigants. It has no application to learned brāhmaṇas, who though not appointed by the king, can state their view of the law, 359 Vide Vyavahārasāra pp. 16–17. Nār. III. 17 requires that all the judges of the Court should give a unanimous decision, and that then only the decision leaves no grievance (in the

mind of the litigants ). 360 The V. P. (p. 27 ) states, following Jaimini XII. 2. 22, that the opinion of the majority of sabhyas is to prevail. 36 According to Gaut. 362 XI. 25 as interpreted by Aparārka p. 599, if there is a difference of opinion among the judges, the king is to seek the advice of those who are learned in the three Vedas ( along with the other vidyās ) and decide the matter finally. Kāt. (58-59) states that the court of justice should have associated with the task of deciding disputes some merchants who belong to a guild, who are men of good family and character, of mature age, endowed with wealth and decent conduct and free from malice. The Mit. and Sm. C. say that this is done to placate the common people in the country. *3 This also shows the growing importance of the moneyed classes and of traders. In the Mrcchakatika a śreṣthin and a kāyastha are associated with the Judge. 

The chief judge and the sabhyag364 were not to hold conver. sation in private with any one of the litigants while the suit was pending and if they did so they were liable to be fined (Kāt. 70). Kaut. IV. 9 prescribes fines and even corporal punishments for judges (dharmasthas) and pradestrs who corruptly give wrong decisions, cause loss or sentence to corporal punishment. If the sabhyas 365 give a decision, which is opposed to smrti and usage, through friendship, greed or fear, each was liable to be fined twice as much as the fine to be paid by the defeated party (Yaj. II. 4, Nar. I. 67, Kat, 79-80), The Visnu Dh. S. V. 180 and Br. prescribe banishment and forfeiture of all property for

sabhyas that give an unjust decision or take bribes. Kat. 81 prescribes that the loss caused by the fault of sabhyas must be made good by them to the losing party, but the decision given by them will stand 36, Sukra (IV.5, 63-64) prescribes the punish ment of a thief for a lekhaka (a scribe) taking down a different deposition from the one actually given or for a sabhya making use of such a deposition knowingly; IV.5.93 prescribes fine and removal from office if a sabhya gives a wrong decision through greed &c. and IV, 5. 282 prescribes a fine of 1000 panas against a judge giving a corrupt decision. There must have been a few cases of judges taking bribes in ancient India as in modern times (even Lord Bacon in the 17th century was found guilty of taking bribes as Lord Chancellor and confessed his guilt). In the Daśakumāracarita 367 (VIII. p. 131) the cynical jester Vihārabhadra says to his king that judges decide matters just as they please after taking bribes and the king thereby incurs in famy and the sin of doing injustice. It was believed that when & just decision was given, the king and the sabhyas became free from sin, the sin reaches him only who is guilty (whether plaintiff or defendant); but where an unjust decision is rendered & quarter of the sin falls on the litigant (plaintiff or defendant) who is guilty of adharma, one quarter each on the witnesses, the Babhyas and the king. The Baud. Dh. S. 1.'10. 30-31, Manu VIII. 18-19, Nār. (III. 12-13) have the same two verses. The Vyava hāratattva (p. 200) says that Hārīta also had the same verses. In the Mattavilāsa-prahasana (pp. 23-24) reference is made to the giving of bribes to the presiding officers of courts ( we should read adhikarana-karanikānām' instead of '-- kāruṇikānām). Kaut. IV, 4 makes it a duty of the samāhartto employ spies in various disguises to test the honesty of judges (dharmasthas) and magistrates (pradeṣtrs) and, if they were found to be ready to succumb to bribes, to order their banishment. 

As to sabhā, vide pp. 92-93 above. The Nirukta (III. 5) in explaining Rg. I. 124. 7 (gartārug-iva sanaye dhanānām) states that gartā means a wooden board or stump in a sabhā on which a sonless widow claiming her husband's wealth had to stand when claiming it.

Different courts of justice 

277 

A court of justice was (acc. to Br. 368) of four kinds, viz. one established (pratiṣthitā) in a fixed place such as a town, apratiṣthita (not fixed in one place, but moving from place to place as on a circuit), mudritā (the court of a judge appointed by the king, who is authorised to use the royal seal), sāsitā (or śāstritā, acc. to S. V. p. 68 and Par. M. III. p. 24) i. e. the court in which the king himself presides. The Court of justice ( in the capital) was to be to the east of the palace as stated by Saṅkha and Bp. (in Sm, C. II. p. 19) and was to face the east. The court-house should be decorated 369 with flowers, statues, paintings, idols of gods and should be furnished with incense, throne or seat (for the king or judge), seeds, fire and water (Br. in Sm. C. II. p. 19). The sabhā was also called, as stated above, dharmadhikarana or simply adhikaraña (in Mrcchakatika IX and the Kādambarī, para 85 ) or dharmasthana or dharmāsana or sadas (Vas. 16.2). The Kādambari (para 85 ) speaks of the royal palace as having a court of justice where the judges (dharmādhikārins ) sat on high cane seats. The time for holding the court is the morning, aco. to Manu VII. 145, Yāj. I. 327. Kaut. states that the king 370 should look into the disputes of people in the 2nd part of the day divided into eight parts. The Dasakumāracarita (note 367 above) shows the same thing. Kāt. (61-62) prescribes that the time for holding the court as laid down in the sāstras is three parts of the day after the first part (when the day is divided into eight parts) i. e. from 7-30 A. M. to noon. There were holidays on which courts were closed i. e. on 8th and 14th tithis, Full Moon day and the amāvāsyā of every month (Samvarta acc. to Par. M. III. p. 23, Harita, acc. to S. V. p. 72). The sabhā is said to have ten angas

by Br. 371 viz, the king, the chief judge appointed by him, the sabhyas, smrti, gañaka (accountant), lekbaka (the scribe), gold, fire, water and svapuruṣa (a bailiff, otherwise called sādhyapāla). The chief judge declares (the law), the king awards punishment, the sabhyas examine the dispute, smrti ( dharmaśāstra ) lays down the rule of decision, the success (of one party or the other) and the punishment; gold and fire are required for taking oaths, the water is for men when they feel thirsty, the ganaka counts the wealth or subject matter of dispute, the scribe writes down the pleadings, depositions and the decision, the puruṣa summons the sabhyas, the defendant, the witnesses and he guards the complainant and the defendant when they have furnished no surety (for appearance ). It is further said that of these ten angas (limbs) the king is the head, the judge the mouth &c. Acc. to Bṛ. (q. in Par. M. III. p. 30) and Sukra IV.5. 43 the accountant and the scribe were to be proficient in grammar, lexicography and counting, were to be pure (in character) and conversant with several alphabets. Puruṣa was called sādhyapāla, who was to be hereditary, strongly built, a śūdra and obedient to the sabhyas (Vyāsa in Par. M. III. p. 30, V. P. p. 31). The ten angas enumerated above (viz. king &c.) are respectively iden tified with the head, the mouth, the arms, the hands, the thighs (ganaka and lekhaka), the two eyes (gold and water), the heart, feet (Bṛ. in V. P. p. 31, Hārita in Rāj. R. p. 20). In the Hall of Justice the king faces the east, the sabhyas, the accountant and the scribe respectively face the north, the west and the south (Bș, in Par. M. II. p. 35, Vyavahārasāra p. 25). Omitting the king and the chief judge the sabhā is said to have eight angas in certain works (e. g. 8. V. p. 72). The chief justice, the sabhyas and the learned brāhmaṇas were probably elderly people, as great emphasis is laid on this by Nār. (II. 18) and Udyogaparva 35.58 'that is not a real sabhā where there are no elderly men &c. ' 372.

Judicial procedure in Mṣcchakaṭika 

279 

: In the drama Mrochakatika (Act IX) we have a graphic, though brief, description of judicial procedure in ancient India. That drama is at least as old as the 4th or 5th century A. D. It is very instructive to compare the procedure described in it with that gathered from Nār., Bṛ. and Kāt. who constitute the leading triumvirate on law and procedure in the smstis and who prou bably flourished a little before and a little after the drama. It will be found on comparison that the procedure in the drama is in essentials the same as that of the three smrtis mentioned above, though there is some difference in minor details. The principal points in the drama bearing on judicial administration may be brought together here at one place. The court house was called 'adhikarana'; the chief judge was called adhikara nika; he was assisted by the śreṣthin (a prominent merchant or banker) and a kāyastha; all three are referred to as ' adhikaraṇabhojaka' and are addressed as adhikȚta or niyukta ( appointed by the king); when a despot was on the throne, the judge's position was precarious and he could be deprived of the post at the king's sweet will the Sakāra, king's brother-in-law, threatens the chief justice with summary dismissal ). There was a servant who arranged the seats in the court, inquired whether there was any litigant, summoned Vasantasenā's mother and Cārudatta ( this man corresponds to the puruṣa or sādhyapāla ); inquiry was made by the judges as to whether any one wanted to file a suit or complaint; the śreṣthin and kāyastha are asked by the presiding judge to write down the important parts of the complainant's statement; a private person (who was not a relativo) could complain to the court about an alleged murder; the judge allowed an old person like the mother of Vasantasenā and a respectable and well-known citizen like Cārudatta to occupy a seat when replying to questions from the court, but Cārudatta. was deprived of this concession when a prima facie case was made out against him; the court-house (being probably situated near the palace ) had near it mantrins, dūtas, spies, an elephant and a horse (and the chief of the city police is asked to ride the horse and find out whether the corpse of a woman lay in the public garden), and kayasthas ; Cārudatta was called upon to state the truth and the judge tells him that in the court no trick ( chala) will be allowed to pass ; 373 when a strong case was

made out against Cārudatta by circumstantial evidence he was asked to confess his guilt, otherwise he was told that he would be whipped (i. e. this refers to whipping to extort a confession, vide above note 332 ); the judge was only to pronounce the judgment and recommend the legal punishment, while the king had the last word about the exact punishment; Manu's work. was an authority; a brāhmana offender was not to be sentenced to death, but was to be banished with all his wealth, though some kings did not act up to this rule; impalement was carried out by cāṇdālas; ordeals of fire, water, poison and balance were known and Sūdraka conveys (viṣasalilatulāgniprārthite me vicare) that Cārudatta had prayed for trial by ordeal, but that the chief justice, because there were witnesses and circumstantial evi. dence, refused that request. 

The court 80 far described (i. e. where the king or the chief justice appointed by him presided) was the highest court, But other tribunals were recognized in the smṛtis and digests, Yāj. I. 30 and Nār. (1. 7) state 374 that law-suits may be decided by village councils ( kulāni), corporations (śreni), assemblies (pūga in Yāj., gana in Nār.), the judges appointed by the king and the king himself, each later one being superior to each preceding one. The first three were practically arbitration tribunals like the modern panchayats. The several words here require explanation and they have been differently interpreted by different digests. Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 2 explains these words at great length. Acc. to him 'kulani' means' group of relatives' and also (acc. to some ) 'impartial persons' (madhyasthapuruṣāḥ) and 'gana' means 'builders of houses and mansions or brāhmaṇas dwelling in mathas'. Acc. to the Mit. and V. P. p. 29 'kulāni' means 'an assembly of the rela tions, agnatic and cognatic, of the litigants'; acc. to the Sm. C. it means 'the agnates of the parties '; acc. to Aparārka it means 'husbandmen'. It appears likely that 'kulāni' means officers who presided over a group of eight or ten villages and who were granted the produce of one kula of land as their salary. Vide Manu VII, 119 and Kullūka thereon and Dāmodar pur plate of Gupta year 124 in which the head of the district (viṣayapati) is said to have been assisted by the nagaraśreṣthin, prathama-kulika and prathama-kāyastha (E. I. 15 p. 130) and

'grāmāsta-kul adhikaranam' in E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 at p. 348 in the reign of Ku māragupta I. From the Sanchi stone Inscription of Chandragupta II ( of the Gupta year 93 i. e. 412–13 A. D.) it appears that panchayats were called 'pañcamandali' (Gupta Inscriptions pp. 29, 31). Śreni' means, acc, to most commenta tors, 'the corporation of persons following the same craft or avocation, though they may belong to different castes' such as horse-dealers, betel-leaf sellers, weavers and dealers in hide. Aco, to the V. M. p. 280, 'śreṇi' is an association of artisans or traders'. "Pūgas' are assemblies of men of one place (a village or a town) belonging to different castes and following different avocations. Kāt. (225 and 682 ) distinguishes between gana and pūga which he respectively defines as assembly of families' (kulas) (Sm. C. II. p. 18, Par. M. III. p. 352) and assemblies of traders and the like’(V. R. p. 668). V. P. p. 30 says gana and pūga are synonyms. The king was thus the highest court of appeal and next to him was the court of the judges appointed by him. Bphaspati (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 281 verse 28) ordains 375 that the kulas, śreñis and gañas that are well-known to the king may decide the disputes of litigants except those that fall under sāhasa and that it was only the king who could carry out the order for fines or corporal punishments, i. e. the arbitration courts could only decide disputes not involving sāhasa and they had no power to execute their decrees about fines and corporal punishments, but that their decisions had to be filed with the king, who, if he did not disapprove of them, put them into execu tion. Pitāmaha 376 appears to mention three classes of State courts, while Yāj. and Nār. refer only to two (viz. that of the chief justice and that of the king himself): 'a dispute decided in a village may be taken to the city and one examined in the city (court) to the king; a dispute decided by the king whether correctly or incorrectly cannot be reviewed.' It is distinotly

provided by Br.37 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 282 verse 31) that the sabhyas are superior to the kulas and the rest, the chief justice is superior to sabhyas and the king is superior to all. Pitāmaha3774 provides that when a litigant is not satisfied with the decision given by a kula tribunal or the others, he can carry the matter by way of appeal to the king. Besides these courts it appears from 

Kautilya that the village headman ( grūmika or grāmakūta ) exercised certain summary powers such as driving out of the village a thief or an adulterer (III. 10) and that he could try some offences (IV. 4, grāmakūtamadhyakṣam vā satri brūyat &c.). Even in the 20th century in the Bombay Presidency under the Village Police Act (Bombay Act VIII of 1867 ) the village head man (called Police Patil) has the authority to try and on con viction to punish with confinement for a period not exceeding twenty-four hours any person charged with the commission of petty assault or abuse within the limits of a village and the person convicted has no right of appeal to any court or magis. trate against such conviction and only the High Court has the power to entertain a petition for revision ( which it hardly ever does). Bhrgus18 quoted in Sm. C.

the king) and the king himself. The vargins 379 are the groups of various kinds such as ganas, pūgas, vrātas, śrenis and others. Kulikas may be the elders of the families of the plaintiff and the defendant. In the Dāmodarpur plates (E. I. 15 p. 130 ) we come across one Dhrtimitra who is described as 'prathamakulika'. The word 'pañcakula' was applied to certain high officers in Gujarat and Kathiawad; vide I. A, vol. 11 p. 220 (Abu Ins. of Bhimadeva dated Vikrama year 1265) and Tawney's translation of the Prabandha-cintamani pp. 18, 84, 129, 149, 190 for ' pañca kula'. The provisions about the conflict between customs and usages on the one hand and śruti and smrti on the other will be dealt with in detail later on in another section. A few words may be said here about conflicts between smstis. In disputes between residents of the same country, the same city or the same hamlet of cowherds or of the same capital or village, the decision should be according to their own conventional usages, but in disputes between these and others (who are not residents of those respective places) the decision must be in accordance with the sacred texts 330 ( Kāt. 47 q. in S. V. p. 72, Par. M. III. P. 41). Another rule is that when there is an apparent conflict between two smrtis, reasoning is to decide in ordinary life which should be followed or reasoning based on the actions of the aged and the experienced is to decide what text to follow (Yāj. II. 21) and the business of the interpreter consists in holding that one of the smrtis contains a general rule and the other an exception or that the two apply to different sets of circumstances (viṣaya vyavasthā) or that an option may be intended. Voluminous glosses have been written on this one text of Yāj II. 21 right from Visvarūpa in the 9th century downwards. Another rule is that in the administration of justice dharmaśāstra rules have superior force to those of arthaśāstra. This has been already referred to above (p. 9). Bhrgu further provides that foresters may get their disputes settled by foresters, members of caravaps by other members, soldiers by (a tribunal of) soldiers and those who stay in a village as well as in a forest may get their dis putes settled either by villagers or by foresters by mutual

agrooment and that the five tribunals for foresters and others are kulikas (high officers or heads of families ), sārthas (members of Caravans), headmen, villagers, citizens. The texts further provide that in certain cases the court was to call in aid outsiders to help in deciding disputes. Vyāsa 331 says: 'In the case of disputes among traders, artisans, husbandmen and actors it is impossible for others to give a (correct) decision; hence such matters should be got decided by experts in those various matters'. Bļ. states that in disputes among husbandmen, craftsmen (carpenters and the like), artisans (like painters), money-lenders, guilds, dancers, sectarians (like Pāśupatas) and criminal tribes the decision should be made with the help of those who understand the conventions made by them and their usages. In disputes about the boundaries of villages and about fields in a village, four, eight or ten neighbours were to settle the boundaries (vide Manu VIII. 258, Kaut. III, 9, Yāj. II. 150-152 ). Kaut. 1. 19 and Br. 342 (q. in V. P. p. 33) say that disputes between those who have performed austerities or between those who are adepts in witchcraft and Yoga should not be decided by the king (unaided), but with the help of those learned in the three Vedas, as otherwise they may feel offended. These quotations show that certain people could claim to be tried by their peers or at least by a jury. This jury system was resorted to for settling complicated questions of fact. It is a very ancient systein, being mentioned even by Gautama 383 XI. 21-22 'the king, having received help from the heads of husbandmen, merchants, cow. herds, money-lenders and artisans as regards disputes in their own groups, should finally decide what is just'. 

It has already been stated above that the king is to decide according to the smrtis. He has also to take into consideration the duties and usages of the several varnas and the eighteen low

castes 34 (acc. to Manu VIII. 41 and Harita ). The eighteen low castes said to be outside the pale of the four varnas and āsramas are enumerated by Pitāmaha, viz. washerman, shoe-maker, nata (dancer caste ), bamboo-worker, fisherman, mleccha, bhilla. abhira, mātanga and nine others (the names of which are not given here as the text is corrupt ). 

The foregoing gradations of tribunals did not all exist at all times in ancient and medieval India. One thing is, however, quite clear. There was always a court of the Chief Justice appointed by the ruling power and final appeal lay to the ruler himself. But as regards inferior tribunals usage varied. For example, it appears from a decision of 1742 in which a ruling of king Shivaji about a Kulkarni vatan is set out that in Shivaji's time disputes could be taken before three different but inferior tribunals, viz, the got ( i. e. the assembly of castemen ) which is somewhat like the kula tribunal of the smrtis, or before arbi trators hailing from a place other than where the dispute took place or before the officers, balutedars and chief men of several villages round about. 385 

Manu (VIII. 23) prescribes that the king fully dressed and with an undisturbed mind, after taking his seat in the Hall of Justice, should perform obeisance to the gods, the guardians of the ( eight) quarters (Indra and others, as specified in Manu VII. 4) and should then commence the work of looking into the legal business. The transaction of legal business has four stages (from the king's or judge's point of view ) viz. first receiving information from a person, then finding out under what title of law ( vyavahārapada) the information falls, then consideration of the pleadings of the parties and the evidence

led by them and lastly the decision.386 When a litigant comes before the court at a proper time (i. e, when the court is sitting) and makes his bow, he (the king or judge ) should 37 address him as follows:- What is your business? What is the injury done to you? Don't be afraid, speak out, man! By whom, when, where and why (was the injury caused ) ? When thus asked whatever he replies should be considered by the judge ) with the sabhyas and brāhmaṇas and if the matter be legally entertainable he ( the judge ) should deliver the seal (sealed order) to the plaintiff or order the bailiff to summon (the defendant)". These observations are made by Kat. (86-88). Whatever & man, being excited by one of the emotions of love (or anger or greed ), says before the court, should be first written down on a board or the like by the scribe ( Nār. 308 II. 18). 

Very elaborate rules are laid down about the summoning of the defendant or accused by Nār. (I 52-54), Br, Kāt. ( 96-100), Sukra (IV, 5-102-106 ) and others. A few of the rules are bet out below. The first person to be summoned is the one against whom a complaint based on suspicion or truth is made by the plaintiff or complainant. But other persons may be called as defendants 19 either when the person proceeded against by the plaintiff puts forward another as liable to plaintiff's claim or makes another liable along with himself or when another person is accepted by the plaintiff (on behalf of another who is a minor &c.) or (acc. to the Madanaratna ) another person himself comes forward (as defendant). The king should not require the personal appearance of the following persons: the diseased, minors, very old ( beyond 70), one in a calamity, one engaged in some

Nār. (1. 53 ) prescribes that cowherds when it is the season for taking cows for grazing, agriculturists in the sowing season, artisans actually engaged in work and soldiers engaged 390a in war should not be summoned to appear in person, while so engaged. In these cases some one on their behalf should be summoned as a representative. But it is provided that even these persons may be summoned with proper safeguards in important cases or grave charges, such as the killing of human beings, theft, rape, eating forbidden food, counterfeiting coins, high treason &c. But women who by their earnings support their families, unchaste women, prosti tutes, women without family and women excommunicated for grave sins may be summoned to appear personally 39. A. person who is summoned and is able to appear but does not appear in person was to be fined according to the value or importance of the subject matter of dispute e. g. in slight causes fifty (copper) panas, two hundred at least in the cases of middling value and 500 panas at least in heavy causes (vide Kāt. 100-101 quoted by Sm. C. II. p 34, Aparārka p. 607.) After taking the fine and waiting for 30 days or a month and a half the king may give a judgment in favour of the plaintiff, due to defendant's default. But if the defendant does come after that time, the suit may be restored and proceeded with. 392 But when there is an invasion by an enemy or a famine or an epidemic or disease the king should not impose a fine, but send a second summons. In the case of those who are exempted from personal appearance ( as above) their relatives (son, father &c.) or some other person

appointed by them (such as a pupil, servant &c.) or one who can be recognised as their agent may be allowed to appear. 39 But no representative was allowed in serious charges cited above (vide Kāt. 93-95 q. by Aparārka p. 639, Sm. C. II. p. 34). If a father, brother, a friend, or a relative appears before the court for the real litigant, the law-buit may be proceeded with (Pitāmaha). Whoever carries on anything through another by appointing him to that task should be understood to have done it himself and the business transacted by such a representative or agent cannot be annulled. If a person who is not a brother nor father nor son nor appointed to represent another prosecutes a law suit for another, he is liable to be fined 393. As the king was supposed to be the guardian of a minor's wealth, it appears from this that a king could have appointed a guardian for the suit when a minor was concerned. The above provisions show that maintenance and champerty were not encouraged by ancient Hindu lawyers. 

An interesting question arises whether lawyers as an institution existed in ancient India. The answer must be that so far as the smrtis are concerned, there is nothing to show that any class of persons whose profession was the same as that of modern counsel, solicitors or legal practitioners and who were regulated by the State existed. This does not preclude the idea that persons well-versed in the law of the smrtis and the pro cedure of the courts were appointed ( niyıkta) to represent a party and place his case before the court. The procedure prescribed by Nār, Bs. and Kāt. reaches a very high level of technicalities and skilled help must often have been required in litigation. In the com. of Asahāya as edited by Kalyāṇabhatta on Nār. (reādāna 4) there is an instructive story from which it appears that persons who had studied the smrtis helped parties in return for a monetary consideration to raise contentions

before the court. But there also the helper comes forward saying that he is a very old friend of the family and has been appointed by the party to represent him. So he corresponded to what is called a recognized agent in the Indian Civil Pro. Code, Order III. r. 2 (Act 1 of 1908). In Sukra IV. 5. 114-117 some important rules are given :34 the person who is appointed to represent a party should get as his wages 1/16, 1/20, 1/40, 1/80 or 1/160 part of the amount in dispute, that the wages become less and less as the claim in dispute becomes higher or if several persons employ one representative; one who knows dharmaśāstra and the procedure of law-guits should be appointed as representative and not any one who is deficient in these; if the representative takes wages without knowing these he should be punished by the king. A representative is to be appointed by the party and not by the king at his will; if the representa tive allows the matter entrusted to him to fail owing to his greed he is liable to be fined 395, In the 'Questions of Milinda' (S.

When one month passed Devadbara paid as interest 200 drammas. When the 2nd montb was running. Devadbara died of high fever, his son died of cholera and only the great-grandson of Devadhara, by name Mahidhara, remained. He was a very young man addicted to gamba ling and other vices. His property was taken under their protection by his maternal uncles. They were advised by a brāhmaṇa who had a smattering of smrti lore and was called Smārtadurdhara 'Don't pay even a rupec to the creditor Sridhara. I shall save you even ia Court by citing appropriate texts.' The uncles replied if you save us, we shall give you a thousand drammas as a reward', When the 2nd month passed (from the date of borrowing), Sridhara called upon the uncles to pay 200 drammas as interest for the 2nd month. They replied *You cannot claim even the priacipal (from the great-grandson of the original borrower), much less interest'. Smārtadurdhara, the legal adviser of the uncles, said "Nārada declares (rṇādāna 4) 'grandsons should pay the debts of the grandfatber; that (debt) ceases from the fourth'. On hearing this Sridhara was stunned, but gathering his wits filed a suit in the court and had summonses issued

E. vol. 36 p. 238 ) there is a passage about certain bhikkhus in the city of Righteousness' (dhammanugara) who are styled * dhammāpanikas' (dealers in dharma) and are described as follows: '(Bhikkhus), who in the spirit and the letter, in its arguments and explanations, its reasons and examples teach and repeat, utter forth and recapitulate the ninefold word of the Buddha; such bhikkhus are called, o king, lawyers in the blessed one's city of Righteousness' and on p. 239 there are 

dhammasetthino '(bankers of dharma), which word reminds us of the śreṣthin in the Mșcchakatika. The dhammāpapikas probably correspond to such lawyers as Smārtadurdhara mentioned above. The rules of Sukra make a near approach to the modern institution of the Bar and the fees prescribed by Sukra are similar to those allowed by the Bombay Regulation II'of 1827 and by Schedule III to the Bombay Pleaders' Act (Bombay Act XVII of 1920). The first legislative enactment in India to deal with lawyers for representing parties passed by the British Government was the Bengal Regulation VII of 1793 which defin ed the privileges, the fees (five per cent up to 1000 and then on a sliding scale) and responsibilities of vakeels (which word originally means 'agent'). 

The plaintiff may put, under restraint till the approach of the summoner (the bailiff) by the king's order the defendant, who does not stand up to meet the claim (i. e. is about to abscond or may abscond) that is to be investigated (or when the plaintiff spoke to him about the claim before coming to court) and 

(Continued from the last page) to Mabidhara,' great-grandson of Devadbara, and his uncles. Sureties were taken from both sides. The uncles were asked (by the court) 'why don't you pay the interest to Sridhara'? They appointed as their representative Smārtadurdhara, who said that he and his ancestors were friends of the family of Mabidhara and so be addressed the court 'I rely on Nārada's words (quoted above), and Mabidhara being the fourth from Devadhara (including the latter) is not liable to pay'. Bhatta Smārtasekbara laughed at this and said 'Smārtadurdhara, you are not deeply learned in the smrti texts por have you studied glosses thereon. The whole of the debt of 10000 drammas lent by Sridhara is still due from Mabidhara, as he is the great-grandson of the borrower, as three male descendants of the borrower are liable to pay the ancestor's debt and as Nārada means only this that the son of the great grandson (who is the fourth from the borrower, excluding the latter from 'computation) is not liable to pay the debt of his great-great-grand-father' and the learned speaker charged bim with having been promised a gratifica tion, Smārtadurdhara and his proteges lost the case.

Nature of asedha

who disregards the words of the claimant. This is called asedha which is explained by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 5 as restraint under the king's order. It is of four kinds viz, restraint as to (sthāna) place (e. g. you are not to go elsewhere from your house or a temple), as to time (e. g. you must present yourself on the 5th of a certain month), restraint from going on (pram vāsa) a journey (till the suit is decided) and restraint from doing certain actions (e. g. you are not to sell certain property or to plough a certain field till the disposal of the suit ) 396 The rules about āgedha are laid down by Nār. (I. 47-54), Br. (g. by V. P. p. 42, Sm. C. II. pp. 30-31), Kāt. 103-110 (all quoted by V. P. pp. 41-42, Sm. C. II. pp. 30-31). Nār. (I. 54) states that those persons whose personal appearance is dispensed with as stated above are not to be subjected to āsedha. Nārada provides that he who disregards the prohibitory order (āsedha ) of the court should be punished and that he who obtains a restraint order against a person that should not have been thus proceeded against should also be punished. Acc. to Kāt. that man who restrains the defendant 80 as to prevent him from exercising his limbs or from talking or breathing freely should be punished and not the defendant if he breaks such restraint. A defendant would not be liable to be fined, if he disregards a restraint order which ties him down to a river ford, or to a forest, to a bad place ( infested by thieves and tigers) or at the time of an invasion (Nār. 1. 49). There is a provision which looks like one for the appointment of a Receiver in modern times. Kāt. (120) says' A king should not allow a litigant to proceed if the litigant retains the property or money which he has (been shown to have) seized; it should be delivered over to the opposing litigant (if he be trustworthy) or it may be kept with a third person (as receiver for the successful party )39. When the defendant comes on being summoned, he and the plaintiff are both to be placed before the judges (Pitāmaha q. in Sm. C. II. p. 34). Then a surety is to be taken from both who would be capable of carrying 

396. It should be noted that these provisions about āsedha are analo gous to those about attachment or arrest before judgment (section 94 and Order 38 of the Indian Civil Pro. Code of 1908) and temporary injunction (Order 39 of the same).

If any one of the parties cannot offer a surety, then he has to be kept in the custody of the court's bailiff (sādhyapala) and has to pay the daily wages of the bailiff at the end of every 398 day ( Kāt. 117 q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 10). The following persone could not be accepted as sureties ( Kāt. 114-116 d. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 57); ' the master (in the case of a party being a servant), an enemy, one authorised by the master, one arrested, one fined, one accused of grave sins or offences, one who is a co-sharer in family property, a friend, one who is a perpetual student, one who is appointed to do the king's business, ascetios, one who would not be able to pay the amount decreed and the fine to the king, one whose father is living, one who incites the party for whom surety is demanded, one whose antecedents are unknown.' When a person ( of any caste ) is kept guarded for want of a surety he is not to be prevented from doing necessary and obligatory acts (bath, sandhyā worship &c.) and if he runs away from the guard he should be fined eight paṇas (Kat. 119 q. in Par. M. III. 58). 

When the defendant comes before the court, the information at first given by the plaintiff is to be written down accurately in his presence together with the year, month, fortnight, day, names (of parties ), caste &c. ( Yaj. II. 6). When the aggrioved party first comes to the court, all that is taken down is the matter in dispute (i. e. the draft of the plaint); when the defendant comes, the plaint is written down with all details (including the grievance as stated in the beginning ). 399 The plaint is called by various names in Sanskrit viz. pakṣa, bhāṣā, pratijna ( Mit. on Yāj. II. 6). Sometimes the word 'pūrvapakṣa' is used for paksa (as in Kāt. 131, Nār. II. 1). Vadin and prativādin generally mean the plaintiff and the defendant, though Vādin sometimes means 'a litigant' (either the plaintiff or defendant). * Arthin' (one who seeks the assistance of the court) and abhiyoktr (attacker) are synonyms of vādin, and pratyarthin and abhiyukta (attacked) are synonyms of prativādin.

( 130-131 ) says that the judge 400 should have the plaint written down on a board (or on the ground) with a piece of chalk as narrated naturally by the claimant and then on a leaf ( palm leaf or bark or paper ) when it is corrected ( after the defendant appears) and that the plaintiff may delete some matters from the original ( draft of) plaint and may fill in gaps and that such amendments may be made in the draft till the plaint is finally settled. 401 It appears from the Vyavahāratattva (p. 205) that the pleadings (the plaint and the reply) could be written down in Sanskrit or in the vernacular of the parties if they were ignorant. The Mșcchakatika (Act IX) shows how the presiding judge asks the sresthin and kayastha to write down the words 'not by me' as the complaint of the Sakāra when the latter averred that Vasantasenā was killed by Cārudatta and not by himself. The plaint could be amended till the filing of the reply 402 (Nār. II. 7). Elaborate rules are laid down about the contents of the plaint by many writers from Kautilya (III. 1) downwards. Kaut. 403 states that in the plaint should be entered the year, season, month, fortnight, day, the documents to be relied upon), the court (in which the plaint is lodged), the (amount of) debt (or other money due ) and the country, village, caste, family, names and occupations of the plaintiff and defendant together with the relationship in which they stood to each other. Kāt. (127-128 q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 6 and Aparārka p. 608) requires that in suits about immoveable property, ten details should be recorded in the plaint viz. the country, the place ( town or village in which the property is situated), situation ( boundaries or the figure such as a square &c.), the caste ( of both parties), names,

the dwelling place (of the parties ), the measure (so many nivartanus &c.), the name of the field, ( names of) the father, grandfather and great-grand-father, mention of the former kings. Kāt. 124-126, Br. (q. in Sm. C. p. 36 and V. M. P. 294 ) give further details, which are passed over for want of space. All the details enumerated above need not occur in every plaint, but the necessary ones must be stated according to the facts of each case 404, 

These rules about the contents of plaints are very similar to those in the Indian Civil Pro. Code, Order VII rules 1-5. 

In modern India no suit or appeal can be filed unless the plaintiff or appellant pays substantial court-fees (Rs. 71 per cent upto Rs. 1000 and 5 per cent for higher claims up to 5000 and so on at reduced rates as the claim rises). It is interesting to see how the litigants in ancient India fared in this respect. It appears that in disputes of a criminal nature no court fees had to be paid in ancient India. The person found guilty had to pay to the king the fine declared in the Smṛtis for offences or awarded by the Court. As regards civil disputes also nothing had to be paid at the inception of the suit. Certain rules are prescribed by Kaut. (III. 1), Yāj., Viṣṇudharmasutra, Nār. and others about payments to the king after the suit is decided, which payments may be regarded as in the nature of court fees. Yāj. II. 42 and Viṣnudharma sūtra VI. 20-21 state that in the case of suits for the recovery of debts the debtor who admitted that he was a debtor (but did not pay the creditor) should be made to pay to the king 10 per cent on the amount decreed and the successful creditor should pay five per cent out of the amount decreed ( as bhfti, compensa tion or court fee ) 405. When the debtor denies the fact of debt altogether and the creditor succeeds in establishing it, the debtor had to pay the amount decreed to the creditor and an equal amount to the king as fine; but if the plaintiff turns out to be a false claimant (i. e, the relationship and the amount of the debt are not proved) he had to pay to the king as fine twice as much as the amount claimed by him (Yāj. 11. 11). Nar. also (IV. 132 ) sayg $06 that a debtor, who is able to repay a debt but does not

do go through wickedness or malice, should be made to pay the debt after recovering five per cent from the debtor. The Sm, C. II. p. 121 says that this applies to a case where the debtor admits his liability to the plaintiff. Manu VIII. 139 gives milder rules: 'if a debtor admits before the Court that he is a debtor, then he has to pay a fine equal to five per cent on the amount decreed, but if he denied the fact of debt altogether, then he has to pay as fine ten per cent'. Manu VIII. 59 which prescribes a fine twice of that amount which the debtor falsely denies or which the creditor falsely claims contains a somewhat different rule (which Medhātithi says applies where parties are guilty of downright fraud, while VIII. 139 applies where there is negligence or loss of memory &c.). In suits other than for debts such fines are also prescribed e. g. in Yāj. II. 26 for one who misappropriates a pledge, II. 33, II. 188 (for breach of the rules of guilds and other groups), Yāj. II. 171 (where a person claiming to be the owner of lost goods and failing to prove his ownership of them was fined pañcu-bandha i. e, a fifth part of the price of the goods). Kaut prescribes 407 that when a party is guilty of contradictory pleadings, or does not cite witnesses though saying he has witnesses and is defeated for these and similar reasons he has to pay a fine of 20 per cent of the claim and 10 per cent only if he relied on his own deposition (and called no witnesses) and further the defeated party has to pay the costs viz. the wages of the bailiff and of the subsistence allowance of witnesses. Therefore it may be said that in ancient times Indian litigants had an easy time, while in modern times litigation is often ruinous, what with the heavy court fees to be paid in several courts, the fees of legal practi tioners and the expenses of witnesses and the delay of years 408. The remark of Dr. Hart (in 'Way to justice' p. 17) is as appli. cable to modern India as to England 'the plain truth is that the justice of the courts is unattainable by some citizens through want of the necessary financial resources; while in the case

of many others it is not worth having at the cost which it involves 

In one of his most famous soliloquies Shakespeare (in Hamlet III. 1 'Oppressor's wrong, the proud mans's contumely, the pangs of despised love, the law's delays') enumerates law's delays among the principal evils of human life. In modern India as in England 409 before 1873 delay in the decision of causes is a crying evil. In the rough and ready methods of administering justice in ancient India care seems to have been bestowed on disposing of cases as quickly as possible. The story of king Nṛga who caused delay has already been referred to (p. 243). Kaut. (III. 1) states that if the plaintiff, after the defendant files his answer, does not on the same day begin to support his case (by evidence) he would be declared to be defeated, since the plaintiff comes to court after determining the strength of his case, but the defendant does not do so (he is dragged to the court); that the defendant may be allowed an adjournment of three or seven days for his defence ; if he is not ready with his defence within that time he may be punished with a fine ranging from 3 to 12 panas ; if he does not answer even after three fortnights he shall be punished with fine for parokta (viz, pancabandha or databandha as stated above in note 407) and the plaintiff's claim would be recovered from the property of the defendant. A similar rule is laid down in Manu VIII. 58. Yaj. II. 12 prescribes that disputes relating to sāhasa (killing by poison or weapon), theft, abuse, assault, cows, charges of grave sins and women ( about the chastity of all women and about ownership in the case of female slaves), the defendant has to make his defence at once, and that in other cases time may be granted at the discretion of the court. Nār. I. 45 is to the same effect. Nār. I. 44 holds that adjournments may be granted in suits about debts and the like for finding out the truth as such disputes are complicated and as memory is weak. Pitamaha (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 42) says that adjournments may be granted in disputes about deposits, sealed deposits, gifts, partnerships, transgression of conventions and partition of heritage. Gautama XIII. 28 speaks in general terms of an adjournment for one year, when the defendant does not remember the transaction, but prescribes immediate trial in

Adjournments 

297 

disputes about kine, women and children or when the matter is urgent i. e. where loss or abandonment of the thing will be the result of delay ( Gaut. XII. 29-30). Brhaspati allows time even to the plaintiff if he is not able to put forward his case owing to his immaturity or lack of boldness. 410 Kāt. (145-158 quoted by Aparārka p.619, Sm. C. II, p. 42, Par. M. III. pp. 69-72) contains elaborate rules about adjournments. He says that according to the importance or otherwise of the dispute, one, three, five, or seven days may be allowed to the defendant to make his defence in disputes about debts, according as the debt was contracted three months ago or 6, 12, 20 or 30 years ago; that even more than a year may be allowed if the defendant is an idiot or lunatic or is suffering from disease or if the subject of dispute or the witnesses are in a foreign country; that more adjournments than one may be granted in such cases; that according to Brhaspati in disputes about immoveable property also no adjournments should be granted; that if the act of God (daiva) or the king prevents the defendant from making his defence he should not be declared defeated, but time should be granted to him to prove this. It is clear that with the advance of time adjournments became longer and more frequent in Kat. compared with the rigid rules of Kaut.. Kat. and Sukra (IV.5. 167, 209 ) contain the last word on this point. According to them delay in deciding causes is tantamount 411 to denial of justice ( dharmavyāpatti, lit. death of Justice ). 

The sequence of stages in a law-suit is as follows: first the plaintiff makes his averments, then the defendant makes his reply; when both have finished, the members of the court speak (or deliberate among themselves) and after them (speaks) the judge ( Kāt. 121 g. by Apararka p. 611, Par. M. III. p. 58). The four stages (pādas ) of a law-suit, acc. to Yāj. II. 6-8, and

Bp. are named 412 bhūṣūpāda (the plaint ), uttarapāda ( the reply ), kriyūpāda (the adducing of evidence), sādhyasiddhi 413 or nirnaya (the decision); while Kāt. 31 states them as pūrvapaksa, uttara, pratyākalita and kriyā. Pratyākalita means 'discussion or consideration among the sabhyas about the burden of proof'(vide p. 260 n. 337). If several persons come simultaneously with compla. ints or plaints, then the order of taking up the cases is regulated by the unirṇui of the plaintiffs i. e. the suit of a brāhmana is first taken up (Manu VIII. 24). Kaut. I. 19 states 414 that the causes of temples (or idols ), ascetics, heretics, brāhmaṇas learned in the vedas, about cattle and sacred places, of minors, of the aged, of those afflicted with disease or misfortunes, of the helpless and of women are to be looked into in the order enumerated or according to the importance of the causes or their urgency. Kāt. ( 12% q. in Sm. C. II. p. 35, Par, M. III. p. 59 ) says that preference should be given to that litigant whose injury is greater or whose cause is more important than those of the rest. Kaut. IIL 20 went 415 so far as to say that judges should look into the causes of idols (or temples), brāhmaṇas, persons performing austerities, women, minors, the old, the diseased, the helpless, even if they did not come forward to complain nor should judges put forward the excuses of time (i. e. the long delay in taking cognisance of their causes), place, or (long) enjoyment (of their opponents ).

the mention of the time and place ( of the cause of action), that omits the statement of the material ( dravya, which is the subject of dispute ) or the amount thereof and that is wanting in (stat ing ) the extent of the relief claimed, that is opposed ( to the interests or usages ) of the country, that is prohibited by the king's order, that mixes up several vyavahārapadas. 416 Certain plaints are declared to be vitiated (pakṣūbhāsa ) 417 and not entertainable viz. a plaint that contains an unknown (or imaginary ) grievance, that discloses no injury, that contains letters or words making no coherent sense, that states no cause of action, that is incapable of proof or is self-contradictory ( Kāt. 140 g. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 6, Par. M. III. 61 ). Nār. II. 8 also points out the faults ( dosas ) of a plaint and explains them (II. 9-14). Bșhaspati states that there is to be no law-suit between teacher and pupil, father and son, husband and wife, and master and servant. This does not mean that law-suits between these pairs are altogether prohibited but that suits between them are undesirable, that the king or judges should persuade them to desist from proceeding in Court, that if they persist the court has to decide the suits according to the sāstra. 418 Manu (VIII. 299-300 ) prescribing the same punish ment as for a thief in cases where a wife, son, slave, servant or brother is beaten for correction more severely than is allowed in the sāstras by the husband, father, master, or elder brother respectively conveys by implication that a legal proceeding by these is possible. The smṛtis did not encourage disputes based on

If a plaintiff states the defendant stole my gold, I deposited a thousand dranimas with him which he does not return, he sold a cow to me without being its owner', there is a joinder of three vyavahārapadas viz, steya, niksepa, asvāmivikraya. This is not a bad or altogether unacceptable plaint. All that is meant is that the trial of all these cannot be carried on simultaneously, but one after another.

flimsy or trumpery grounds. Bphaspati 419 says that a plaint that is nirarthaka ( i. e. the injury in which is very small or the monetary value involved is negligible) should not be entertained by the king. This is on the principle of de minimis non curat lex (the law does not take account of trifles ) also embodied in sec. 95 of the Indian Penal Code. 

When the plaint has been finally settled, the defendant should be called on to reply in writing to the plaint in the presence of the plaintiff ( Yāj. II. 7, Nār. II. 2). This is called uttara ( reply ) or pratipaksa (Nar. II. 2). When time may be given to the defendant for putting in his answer has already been stated above. 

The answer of the defendant must possess the following characteristics viz. it must completely meet all the points of the plaint, it must not deviate from the truth, must not employ vague words, must not be self-contradictory, it should not be such as to require further explanation (because of containing words in a foreign tongue or unknown or rarely used words or elliptical or badly arranged sentences ). 420 A reply is of four kinds, (1) mithya ( of denial ), sampratipatti or satya ( confession or admission), kārana or pratyavaskandana (of special plea or demurrer ), prānnyāya or pūrvanyāya ( of former judgment or res judicata ). A reply of denial may take four forms (Nār. II, 5) viz (1) this ( what is affirmed in the plaint) is false, I do not know anything about it, I was not present ( when the transact ion alleged in the plaint is said to have taken place ), I was then not born. 421 The first is a direct denial, the others are implied or indirect.

Where the defendant accepting as correct the matters (or facts ) set out by the plaintiff raises a plea, that is a reply of special plea. 423 The same is designed by some as adhārya or adharya (rendering futile) of the plaint. For ex ample, where plaintiff avers that defendant took one hundred rupees and defendant accepts that fact but adds either that he later on returned them or that they were really donated to him, that is a reply of special plea. Where a person though defeated in a (former ) proceeding again causes a plaint to be written and is addressed ( angwered ) with the words ' you were formerly defeated', that is a reply of former judgment. That there was a former judgment between the same parties may be proved by citing the judges or arbitrators or by citing other witnesses or by producing the writing itself i. e. the copy of the judgment ( Kāt. 172 ). 424 In a reply of admission there are only two stages of vyavahāra viz, the plaint and the reply; there is no need of proof ( so there is no kriyāpāda ) and the plaintiff succeeds as a matter of course ( and so there is no necessity of a regular judgment, nirnaya). Kāt. (173-190 ) states at great length the faults of a reply and also what are not proper replies. The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 7), Aparārka pp. 613-614, Sm. C. II. pp. 43-46 and

other digests quote long passages from Kāt., Bș., Harita, Vyāsa and others on faults of uttara and illustrate them at length. These have to be omitted for want of space. One of the faults is 'sankara'(mixture or confusion or misjoinder of pleas in defonce). For example, if the plaint alleges' the defendant took gold, a hundred rupees, certain valuable clothes and a quantity of corn and has not returned any of them,' and the defendant's reply is 'I took the gold, I never took any rupees, the plaintiff donated the clothes to me, as to the corn plaintiff had already filed a suit against me and failed'. Here the reply contains all four varieties, viz. the first is a reply of admission, the 2nd is one of denial, the third is a special plea and the 4th is a plea of former judgment. This is a sankara. But it is not meant that this reply would not be allowed. All that is meant is that, as the burden of proof varies, the adducing of evidence will not be allowed simultaneously, but one after another. Vide Mit. on Yāj. II. 7, Par. M. III. pp. 77–80. These questions are concerned with cases in which several issues arise, the burden of proving some of which lies on the plaintiff and the burden of proving others lies on the defendant. If a defendant does not come forward to give a reply, the king or judge should make him give one by sāma ( conciliatory words ), bheda (threats ) and other ways and if he does not give a reply for seven days after that, he may be declared to have been defeated and a decree may be passed against 425 him. Kaut. (III. 1), Yāj. II. 9, Nār. I. 55 Kāt. (163) state that a defendant cannot 426 raise a counter-claim (pratyabhiyoga ) as long as he has not met the attack of the plaintiff, nor should another plaintiff attack a person who is a defendant in a suit already filed, except in the case of abuse and assault, sāhasa ( death or grievous hurt by a weapon &c.), theft or in a very urgent matter, or in disputes among members of caravans or guilds or in charges of adultery, Yāj. II. 29, Nār. IV. 93, Sukra IV. 5. 120 say that when a litigant dies while a suit is pending, his son (or other representative ) who takes his estate should carry on the litigation or be liable for the claim and the son cannot add his own enjoyment (to make up

There were many grounds on account of which a litigant became what is called hina (a losing party) and some times either had his plaint dismissed or his defence struck out and a decree passed against him or he was simply fined. For example, Nār. II. 33 speaks of five kinds 428 of hina viz. one who changes his state ments (or pleading), who does not prosecute his pleading by adducing evidence (i. e. avoids investigation), who does not appear when summoned, who gives no reply, who disappears or runs away when summoned. Nār. I. 56-61, II. 24 explain some of these and other hina parties. Kāt. 202 (q. by Sm. O. II. p. 47) prescribes that the above five should respectively be fined 5, 10 12, 16 and 20 panas. Nār. 11. 25 states that in all civil disputes such as those about women, land or debts the litigant does not lose his cause even if he commits a mistake in his statements, but he is liable to fine. This conveys that in disputes arising out of wrath (manyuksta i.e. in criminal matters ) a person loses his cause if he is guilty of the above acts and he is prohibited from pursuing the matter again. Kaut. III. 1, Manu VIII. 53-57 contain in almost the same words, certain similar rules, Kaut. calling the several actions causes of parokia ( defeat). Vide Yāj. II. 16, Sukra IV. 5. 136, Kāt. 191-210 for further details on dismissal for default and cognate matters. In these cases of hinavādins, though a fine was imposed, a retrial could be ordered. When defendant filed his reply and parties joined issue in court, Br. and Kāt. say that they should not then be allowed to compromise the dispute privately without the permission of the

court; if they did so they were both to pay double of the fine imposed on a defeated party, as they deprived the king of his dues ( court fees). But a compromise with the court's permis sion was allowed when the parties were in doubt as to what the witnesses might say or the sabhyas might decide (in such cases it would be wisdom for the parties to compromise) and particularly when the evidence on both sides was evenly balanced or where there was a conflict between the different smrtis and usages. 

When the reply had been given the subhyas had to consider the question about the burden of proof. Br. 430 says the sabhyas after considering the nature of the reply should call upon ono of the parties that are in court to establish his case ' (Sm. C. II. p. 50). What a party sets out to establish is called sādhya and the means whereby the claim of the litigant) in its entirety is established is called sādhana ( Kāt. 213 in V. P. p. 79). Yāj. II. 7 and Nār. II. 27 say that the party (on whom the burden of proof lies ) should immediately (after the reply is given) write down the means whereby he proposes to prove his averments. This third stage (pāda) is called kriyā i. o. proof. Sadhya and kārya are synonyms, kriya and sādhana also are synonyms ( Kāt, in Aparārka p. 616, Vyāsa in Sm, C. II. p. 54). The rules about burden of proof are laid down by Hārita ( 9. in Mit, on Yāj. II. 7, Aparārka p. 616). In a reply of denial, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, in a reply of former judgment or of a special plea, it is on the defendant and in a reply of admission no question of burden of proof arises. Compare also Nār. II. 31. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 80 states another rule that an affirmative proposition has to be proved by him who asserts it (bhāvapratijñāvādina eva kriya). Yāj. II. 22, Nār. II. 28-29 and IV. 69, Br. ( in Sm. C. II. p. 54 ), and others say that means of proof are two-fold, human and divine, and that docu ments, witnesses and possession are the human means of proof (Vas. 16. 10 also ), while the ordeals of balance and others are divine means. Yāj. II. 22, Nār. II. 29, Kāt. 217 expressly state that ordeals are to be resorted to only when none of the human means are possible or available. If one party relies on human means alone and the other offers divine means, the king (or judge ) has to accept human means and not divine; in disputes among men, if there be human means of proof though reaching

(or covering ) only a portion (of the allegations in the plaint) then human means should be accepted and not divine ones even though the latter may cover the whole ground ( Kāt. 218-219 9. by Mit. on Yaj. II. 22). This latter rule is based on the proposition laid down in Yaj. II. 20 and Viṣnudharmasūtra VI. 22 that when a party totally denies a claim and the opponent establishes by evidence a substantial portion of it, the judge may pass a decree against the denying party for the whole of the claim. This is practically the same as the maxim ' omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem '. 431 Therefore the general rule was that the divine mode of proof was to be resorted to only in the absence of any human means of proof. Kāt. 229 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 22, Aparārka p. 629 ) allows witnesses or ordeals when the disputo is started with reference to sāhasa, assault or abuse and causes that spring from force and Kāt. 230 (4. in Sm. C. II. p. 51 ) provides that, in the case of a person guilty of sāhasa perpetrated in secret, investigation has to be made by divine proof. Kat. 225-228 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 22, Aparārka P. 629, Sm. C. II. pp. 53-54) lay down certain rules about preference among the several means of proof: whatever are declared as the conventional usages of the associations of traders, of guilds (of artisans) and of groups (of brāhmaṇas ), the means of proving them are documents and not ordeals nor witnesses; enjoyment 431a ( or possession) alone is weightier in the case of the making and (the use of) doors and ways, as also in the case of water-courses and the like (i. e, in the case of easements ) and not writing nor witnesses; in the case of things promised to be given but not given, when a decision is to be given in disputes of servants with masters, in the matter of taking back a thing after it is sold or when a person having purchased a thing does not pay the price, in gambling and prize fighting-when in these matters disputes arise the means

of proof are witnesses and not documents nor ordeals. Marioi (q. by Sm, C. II. 60, V. P. P. 141 ) states that as regards the sale, mortgage, gift or partition of immoveable property & document ( should be executed as it ) enables the person ( in whose favour it is executed) to acquire (clear) title and freedom from doubt 43% (even after the lapse of years). It is in consonance with this that the Indian Legislature (in the Transfer of Property Act, IV of 1882 ) requires writing and registration as regards the sale, mortgage and gift of immoveable property. Nārada IV. 75 very concisely hits the special characteristics of each pramāṇa: 

a document is always strong, witnesses are strong (as evidence) only as long as they are alive, possession becomes strong as time passes. The comparative strength of the several kinds of evidence is well put by Bphaspati 433: Witnesses are superior to inference ( circumstantial evidence ), a document is superior to witnesses, undisturbed possession for three generations is superior to all these'. Kāt. 221 (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 80 and V. P. p. 80 ) gives the warning that when a litigant abandoning a strong ground or means of proof resorts to a weak one to prove his case, he would not be again entitled to rely on that (strong ground of proof ) after the members of the court have decided as to who should succeed. This practically propounds the same rule as that of constructive res judicata contained in explanation 4 to section 11 of the Indian Civil Pro. Code (of 1908). 

The means of proof will now be briefly dealt with in order. And first come documents. Those in search of an exhaustive treatment may usefully consult Dr. Amareshwar Thakur's * Hindu Law of Evidence' (Calcutta, 1933). 

When writing was first employed in India and how the Indian Brahmi alphabet was derived have been moot points for many decades among scholars. Max Müller's theory ("History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature' p. 507 ) that the use of writing for literary purposes was unknown to Pāṇini was thoroughly exploded by Goldstückor in ‘Pāṇini and his place in Sanskrit Literature and was later on abandoned by Max Müller himself.

Origin of writing in India

Then Bühler ( in 'the Origin of the Indian Brahmi alphabet') started the theory that Brāhmi was derived from a foreign Semitic script about 800 B. C. and this hypothesis held the field for a long time ( vide 8. g. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' chapters VII and VIII). Even Western scholars are not now prepared to accept this dating of Bühler; vide Cambridge History of India, vol. I.p. 141 (1922). The excavations at Mohenjo daro tend to throw grave doubts on this theory and discredit it. At Harappa and Mohenjo-daro there is writing (not satisfactori ly deciphered yet ) on burnt clay and pottery. The Piprahva vase shows writing on stone several centuries before the Christian era and the Sobagpur copperplate inscription is the earliest writing on copper plates yet discovered ( vide Annals of B. O. R. Institute, Vol. XI. p. 32 ff). This is not the place to discuss the questions about the origin of the art of writing in India and of the Brāhmi script. It cannot be gainsaid that the most ancient dharmaśāstras refer to writing as well-known. Gaut. XIII. 4 appears to refer to a witness signing himself as such on a document. Vas. 16. 10, Vispudharmasūtra VI. 23, Yāj. II. 22 mention likhita (document) as the first means of proof. Manu VIII. 51 uses the word karana in the sense of document (arthepavyayamūnam tu karanena vibhāvitam), in VIII. 168 refers to documents obtained by coercion and in IX. 232 to fabricated royal edicts ( kūṭaśāsana). Kaut, has a special chapter ( II. 10) on royal writings (sāsana), in which he dilates upon the qualifications of the king's scribe, on the contents of an official document, the good points required in an official missive, on various divisions of writings and on the faults in official writings that are to be avoided. In I. 11 Kaut. prescribes that the king should hold consultations with absent ministers by sending a letter (patra, a leaf of palm or a piece of birch bark or similar material) and in I. 19 states that consulta tion by letter (para) with the council of ministers should be held in the fifth part of the day. In II. 7 Kaut. advises the con struction of rooms with shelves for books containing accounts (akṣapatalam nibandhapustakasthānam kārayet ). Vide also Kaut. II. 21, II. 30, IV. 9, IV, 10 for references to writing in various other connections. Kaut. (III. 1) appears 434 to use the word karana - in the sense of document and gives a rule which is the same as Yāj. II. 23. Yaj. I. 319 speaks of land grants being written or

engraved on cloth or copperplate. Megasthenes (McCrindle p. 69 ) no doubt says that Indians have no written laws, but there is no doubt that he is under some misapprehengion as to what he was told, since in another place (p. 83 ) he refers to philosophers committing useful suggestions to writing. Similar ly Strabo ( XV. 1. 53-54 ) states that the Indians were ignorant of writing, but (67) narrates that Nearchus states that Indians write letters on cloth. One of the oldest copperplate grants is the Taxila plate of Moga (identified with Moa of the Sakas ) and is not later than 120 B. C. Vide E. I. Vol. IV. p. 54 and Rapgon's 'Indian coins' p. 7. It appears that wooden boards were used for writing ephemeral matters and patra for more permanent use, as Kāt. (p. 293, n. 400 above ) states that the first information was to be written on a board with chalk and the formal plaint on a leaf ( patra). The Lalitavistara ( 10th chap. p. 143, B. I. ed.) states that the Buddha used a board of sandal-wood for learning the scripts (-candanamayam lipi phalakam-ādāya ). 

Yaj. II. 84-94, Nār. IV. 69-75 and 135-146, Bṛ., Kat. 249-312, Sukra II. 291-318, IV. 172-182 and several digests devote great attention to documents. A fow salient points only will be brought out here. Nār. (IV. 70-71 ) eulogises documents by saying that if the Creator had not created writing which is like an excellent eye, the world would have come to grief and that a document is an indubitable means of apprehending the time, the place, the object, the material, the extent and the duration of & transaction. Bṛ. (q. in V. P. p. 141 ) says that, since 435 people begin to entertain doubts (about a transaction) oven in six months (from an occurrence or transaction) the Creator therefore created in the hoary past letters which are recorded on writing material (patra). The Lalitavistara ( about 2nd or 3rd century A. D.) mentions 64 scripts which were known to the Buddha, among which the first is Brahmi ( 10th chap. p. 143 ). Nār., Br., and Sukra probably try to explain why the alphabet current in their days was called Brāhmi ( it was created by Brahma). Sukra II. 297, IV. 5. 172 are similar verses.

Classification of documents 

309 

VII. 2 dividos documents into three kinds viz. those written before the king (i. e. by public officers ), those bearing the superscription of witnesses and those without witnesses. The first is a document written in a state office by a scribe appoint od by the king and bearing the signature of the head or superintendent of the office. This is just like the registration of documents in modern India. Br. 437 (q. by V. P. p. 141, V. May, p. 24) divides documents into three sorts viz. royal writing, writing made at a fixed place and that written in one's own hand. Nār. IV. 135 speaks of two kinds viz. one written by the executant himself in his own hand and that written by another;( the first of these is valid) without attesting witnesses, while the second requires to be attested. In the former no writer (lekhaka ) nor witnesses are necessary, while in the latter both are necessary. Even now in India no deed concern ing even immoveable property is required by law to be attested except mortgages and gifts. The author of the Sangraha, the Mit. on Yāj. II. 84 and several others divide documents into rājakiya (public) and jānapada (private or of the common people ). The V. Mayūkha (p. 24) says that laukika and jānapada are øynonyms and jānapada document is of two kinds viz. written by the executant himself in his own hand and that written by another, and that the first may be without attesta tion of witnesses, but the other must be attested. On Yāj. II. 22 the Mit, divides documents into śāsana and ciraka. The first is the same as rājakiya (described in Yaj, I. 318-320) and ciraka is practically the same as jānapada writing. On Yāj. II. 89 the Mit. remarks that a royal deed must be written in correct and elegant language but a document executed by ordinary people is not required to be in correct Sanskrit, but may be written in the local dialect of the parties. Yāj. II. 89 states that a document written by the executant himself in his own hand is autho ritative except when it is brought about by force or fraud. Yāj. II. 84-87 prescribe that a document of debt or the like should be written down by mutual agreement, that the creditor's name should be placed first, that it should

mention the year, month, half month, tithi ( day ), the names, caste, gotras, the Vedic School, the names of the fathers of the parties, that when the writing is finished the debtor should write at the end that the deed is approved by N. N. (the execu tant) son of so and so, that an even number (i. e. not less than two) should attest the document, stating their father's names and that they attest as witnesses and the scribe should write at the end that he wrote the document at the request of both parties. If the debtor or any witness cannot write, his signa ture should be made by another in the presence of all witnesses (Nar. q. by Mit, on Yāj. II. 87 and by Vy. Nir. p. 87 without name ). Rājakiya documents are of three kinds (acc. to Br. quoted in V. P. p. 141, V. May. p. 24) viz. sāsanı (a royal grant of land), jayapatra (a judgment deciding a law-suit), prasāda-patra ( a deed showing the king's pleasure at the devoted service or bravery of a person); acc. to Vasiṣtha (g. in Sm. C. II. p. 55 and V. May, p. 28) it is of four kinds viz. sāsana, jayapatra, ājñāpatra (a royal command addressed to feudatories, high or low officers like the wardens of the marches ), prajfhāpanāpatra (a writing of request addressed by the king to sacrificial priests, a purohita, teacher, learned brahmapas or other highly honoured persons); it is five-fold acc. to S. V. pp. 111-113 viz. sāsana, jayapatra, ajñāpatra, pra jñāpanāpatra and prasā dapatra. Kaut. in II. 10 speaks of seve ral kinds of royal orders and names them, such as prajñāpana (request by a messenger about what another prays), ajñāpatra (as above), paridāna (honour to the deserving or gift in distress), parihara (remission of taxes for certain castes or villages by the king), niss stilekha (writing whereby the king accepts the actions or words of some trustworthy person as his own), pra vȚttika (conveying information about some portentous happen ing or some news about enemies etc.), pratilekha (reply in accordance with discussion held with the king on a message from another), sarvatraga (order addressed to high functionaries and officers for the welfare of travellers). The contents and form of royal grants have been described in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 860-861. The jānapada writings are divided into various sorts, seven (aco, to Br. g. by Aparārka p. 683, Sm. C: II. p. 60) or eight (aco, to Vyasa in Sm. C. II. p. 59 ) and the Sm, C. remarks that there is no emphasis on the number and there may be many more varieties. Bp. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 305), Kāt. (254-257) and others mention and define the following jānapada writings; bhāga- or vibhāgapatra' (deed of partition), dānapatra (deed. of gift),

krayapatra (sale deed), adhānapalra or adhipatra ( deed of pledge or mortgage), sthitipatra or samvitpatra (deed of convention, which is made by the inhabitants of a village or city or the members of a corporation or guild by mutual agreement for settling their conventions), dāsapatra (deed of bondage to serve executed by a person devoid of food or clothing), ralekha or uddhārpatra (bond of debt promising return at a future date with interest ), risuddhipatru (deed of purification given to a person with the attestation of witnesses when a penance for a sin has been per formed), sandhipatra (deed of peace when a compromise in the presence of leading people after a charge of the commission of a crime has been made), simāpatra (deed of boundary when a dispute about it is settled), upagata (a receipt passed by the creditor to a debtor on payment of the whole or part of a debt, Yāj. II. 93), anvādhipatra (a sub-mortgage i. e. where the mort gagee or pledgee mortgages or pledges the property or thing to another and hands over tbe former deed to his own creditor). The two branches of private documents (jānapada) are either ciraka or not ciraka; ciraka is defined as a document written by hereditary scribes residing in the capital, who are approached by the parties and bearing the signatures of the parties and witnesses and the names of their fathers (Sangraha q. by Sm. C. II. p. 59, Par. M. III. p. 127). Vide n. 437 above and Sukra II. 299-318 and IV.5.172-177 for definitions of these and other kinds of documents. But acc. to Vyasa quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 59 private documents are of eight kinds viz. ciraka, upagata (a receipt), svahasta (written by the executant himself), ādhipatra, krayapatra, sthitipatra, sandhipatra, viśuddhipatra. Some works like the Vyavahārasāra (p. 69) and the Mit. write the word as ciraka and not ciraka. It was so called (viz, ciraka ) probably because it was written on the back (of the bark of the birch or some other tree). If the proper word is ciraka then it was employed because being executed by scribes appointed by the king, it had validity for all time (cira) as compared with purely private documents. 'Ciraka' in this last sense seems to be equal to sthānakrta' of other writers. 

Nār. 438 IV. 136, Viṣnu. Dh. S. VII. 11 and Kat. (252) require that a document is held valid which is not adverse to the cus tom of the country, the contents of which follow the rules

The Sarasvativilāsa p. 114 holds that pañcārudhatva consists in having the creditor, debtor, witnesses ( as one item ), scribe and the matter to be written, Hārsta and Vyasa (q. in 8m. C. IL p. 59 ) employ the dual (sākṣiṇau), while Yāj. II. 87 employs the plural. Therefore ordinarily two witnesses sufficed, but in very important writings there should be more witnesses. Viāva. rūpa reads 'asamāḥ' in Yaj. II. 87 and requires three witnesses as the minimum. Nār. IV. 137, Viṣnu440 Dh. S. VII. 6-10, Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p.307 v. 23.), Kāt. (271) state that a document is invalid that is executed by a person intoxicated, by one already charged (with an offence), by a woman, a minor, that has been brought about by threats or deceit or coercion, by one dying, by one diseased, by a lunatic, or by those that are dependent. Viṣnu Dh. S. (VII. 8-9) and Kat. 273 (g. by V. M. p. 338, Apararka p. 686, Par, M. II. p. 131) state that a docu ment may be held invalid owing to defects in the witnesses or in the scribe or to the fraud of the creditor or executant. 

Nār. IV. 145, Kāt. (306-307), Samyarta ( both quoted by Aparārka pp. 691-692) and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 309 verse 31 ) say that no oral evidence should be allowed to contradict the (terms of a) document, that the mode of proving ( a matter) by a docu ment is always superior, that a writing can be refuted or superseded only by another document relating to the same matter and not by the oaths of witnesses and that if oral evidence

If there is a conflict among documents then a jānapada document (written by a scribe and attested ) is superior to one written in the hand of the executant himself and a public document is superior to a jānapada one ( Vyasa q. by Sm.

Yāj. IL 91, Nār. IV. 146 and Kāt. 31% (q. by Aparārka p. 687 ) prescribe that when a document is in another country or when it is illegibly written, when it is lost or its letters have become indistinct (by lapse of time or other causes) or it has been stolen or is crushed or burnt or shattered into pieces, another document may be caused to be written ( if both parties agree): but if they do not agree and the contents have to be proved or if the executant denies his signature, then Nār. IV. 142 and Kāt. ( 282 q. by Sm. C. II. p. 63 ) say that time may be given to bring it from the foreign country or the contents may be proved by the evidence of the attesting witnesses or of the scribe or of those that have seen it. This shows that the smrti law required the produc tion of the document itself as primary evidence, but allowed secondary evidence only in exceptional cases. 142 If a document belonging to one man is produced by another the latter has to explain his custody of it 443 ( Vyāsa q. by Aparārka p. 690, Sm.

When there is a doubt about the genuineness of a docu ment, it can be established by comparison with other documents admitted to be written or signed by the same person, by ratioci nation, by the probability of the two parties being together at the time of the transaction, by citing the attesting witnesses, 445 by the peculiarities or flourishes in writing certain letters or making certain signs (in the writing questioned and in other admitted writings), the previous transactions between the par ties (or their subsequent conduct), and the source of the acqui sition of the subject matter in dispute (Yāj. II. 92, Visnu Dh. $. VII. 12, Nār. IV. 143-144, Kāt. 283 q. in Mit. on Yāj. II. 92). Viṣpu Dh. S. (VII. 13) and Kāt. 446 285-286 ( q. by Aparārka pp. 689-690) prescribe that if the debtor, creditor, witnesses or the scribe be dead the authenticity of the document has to be ascertained by (a comparison of the signatures on the disputed document) with other specimens of their handwriting or signatures or other documents executed by the debtor. Kāt. 287 (g. by Aparāka p. 689, Sm. C. II. p. 64 and Par. M. III. p. 134) states the striking147 rule that when a document bears the royal seal, that document is presumed to be authentic, even though all the three (viz. the debtor, the witnesses and the scribe ) are dead. This shows that documents bearing the king's seal or that of royal officers were regarded as prima facie genuine and this rule is analogous to the provisions in sec. 79 of the Indian Evidence Act and sections 59-60 of the Indian Registra tion Act.

A, vol. 30 pp. 201 223 for many forged grants. Verses (variously attributed to Kāt. or Brhaspati by the digests) state that when a loan ( recorded in a document) has not been expressly claimed by the creditor able to claim from a debtor who is able to pay off and who is at hand, the document loses its validity because a suspicion arises that the debt has been paid off and that a document executed more than thirty years before which has never been seen ( by any body ) nor read out ( by the creditor to any body ) does not attain validity even though the witnesses on it are living. Nār. IV. 141 is very similar to this last. Kāt. 298–299, 301 (q. by Par. M. III. 136, Mit, on Yāj. II. 24, Aparārka P. 690-691 ) prescribe that if no objection is raised for twenty years as regards a patent fault in a document of debt or pledge or of the settlement of boundaries, then the document ceases to be voidable. Kāt. 275 and Bṛ. ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 302 V. 25 ) both quoted by Aparārka p. 671 and V. P. p. 122 require that the latent defects in documents or witnesses must he declared ( pointed out) by the disputant at the ( proper ) time (i. e. when they are produced), while patent defects may be considered by the sabhyas at the time (of the consideration of the evidence) by reference to the rules of the śāstra. Yāj. II 93-94, Visnu Dh. S. VI. 25–26 448 prescribe that when a debtor pays part of a debt, the debtor should write on the back of the document how much he paid or the creditor may hand over to the debtor a writing of receipt signed or written by himself, particularly when the original document is not at hand, and when the whole debt is paid or the contract is fully performed the creditor should tear off the document or should execute another document in order to make clear the fact of satisfaction 

The fabrication of royal edicts and private documents was so much condemned by the sentiments of society that Manu IX, 232 and Visnu Dh. S. V. 9-10 prescribe the extreme penalty of death for such offences as in the case of the murder of women, minors and brāhmaṇas. Yāj. II. 295 ( = Matsya 227. 202)

CHAPTER XII 

BHUKTI or BHOGA (possession ). 

According to Gaut. X. 39 a man becomes an owner by inheritance, purchase, partition, seizure (appropriation of forest trees and other things which have no owner ) and find ing (i. e. appropriation of lost property the owner of which is unknown). Gaut. (X. 40-41) adds that in the case of brāhmaṇas acceptance (of a thing donated) is an additional mode (of becoming an owner), that conquest in the case of a ksatriya and gain ( by trade or labour ) in the case of a vaisya or sūdra are also additional modes. Vag. 16. 16 mentions eight modes. Br. ( quoted in V. P. p. 153, Aparārka p. 635, S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 309 v. 2) mentions seven modes of acquiring immovable property viz. by learning, purchase, mortgage, valour (i. e, conquest ), through the wife ( as dowry ), inheritance (from an ancestor ) and succession to an issueless kinsman, Nārada (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 70) mentions the same except mortgage. None of these expressly says that long possession is by itself a source of ownership. Great divergence 449 has prevailed throughout the centuries among the sages and digests about the relation of title and possession and about the length of possession necessary for making a person secure in his right to property by reason of possession. Possession (bhukti ) may be with title ( sāgamā) or without title ( anagamū). Agama means ' origin' or 'source of title' such as purchase or simply ' title :. 450 Manu VIII. 200, Yaj. II. 27, Nār. IV. 84 employ that word in that sense. Vide Kāt. 317 (q. in Sm. C. II p. 73 and Par. M. III. p. 141). If property is held in one of the modes of acquiring ownership stated above and there is also possession, one's right to that property is indefeasible ( Nār. IV. 85, Bṛ. q. by Sm. C. II. p. 70, S. B. E. 33 pp. 309 and 312 v. 3 and 22 ), but possession without a clear title

does not lead to (or ripen into ) ownership 451 ( with certain exceptions to be noted later on). Vyāsa and Pitāmaha 482 declare that possession in order to be valid must have five characteristics viz. it must have title behind it, must be of long standing, unbroken, free from protest ( by another person) and in the presence ( i. e. before the very eyes ) of the opponent (q. in Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 and Aparārka p. 635 ). Even title, if not accompanied by some slight possession, has no strength, while title is stronger than possession not handed down hereditarily (Yāj. II. 27). Nār. IV, 85 states that possession becomes strong when backed by clear title. These passages present some difficulty and make title and possession depend on each other. Nār. ]V. 77 states that even if there be a document or witnesses to support a man's title, when there is no enjoyment, particularly in the case of immovable property, there is no validity. All that is, meant is that a transfer without possession though under a deed or before witnesses is risky and that title and possession lend support to each other as stated by Nār. IV. 84-86, Bṣ., Harita and Pitāmaha. 453 Nār. (IV. 86-87 ) declares that one who pleads mere possession and no title at all should be considered a thief on account of his putting forward the deceptive plea of possession (which even a thief can assert) and that the king should punish as a thief one who enjoys a property even for hundreds of years without title. All that this last verse means is that the person in possession must prove legal origin or such a long possession that there is no possibility of an inference that the possession

of his ancestor originated is wrong. Delivery of possession was the principal mode of transferring ownership in ancient times in almost all systems of jurisprudence and so possession was given great weight as evidence of ownership. 454 The Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 makes the position clear. In the case of a gift or sale there must be the cessation of the ownership of the transferor and the arising of the ownership of the transferee. This last occurs only when the transferee accepts the property and not otherwise. Acceptance is mental, vocal and physical (i. e. the acceptor makes a resolve to accept, says that he accepts and takes physical possession). These three may exist in the case of such movable articles as gold, clothes &c. But in the case of a field physical acceptance is not possible except by enjoying the fruits or profits thereof. Therefore in order to make a gift or sale perfect there must be some slight possession at least. In the absence of such possession mere title is weak. Title may succeed against the man in possession who has no title and who has not been in possession for the prescribed period (such as three generations ). If the possessor proves possession for that period he will succeed against one who has bare title and 110 possession whatever. If it is known or proved that a man purchased from A but got no possession and that another purchased from A subsequently and got possession (but was not in continuous possession for the prescribed period ) the prior title though without possession will prevail over the later one, acc. to Yāj. II. 23. But when it is doubtful as to which title is prior and which posterior the one with possession will prevail. Where the possession has been uninterruptedly with a man's ancestors for three genera tions he will succeed against one who has bare title. Therefore possession was not absolutely indispensable for transfer even acc. to the Mit. and other works, but title without posses sion was risky and so possession was insisted upon as it was .nine points of law'. It follows, acc, to the Mit., that (1) when possession was comparatively of short duration and not supported by any title much weight was not attached to possession and title by itself would prevail against it, that (2) continuous possession for three generations (though there is

nothing to show there was title to begin with ) will prevail over a mere documentary title and that (3) a prior title with less than the possession for three generations (but with some possession ) succeeds over a later title accompanied by posses Bion. Long possession was assumed to have originated in legal title, although owing to lapse of time it was not possible to prove the origin. 45$ The main controversy has raged round the question of what is long possession. Yāj. II. 24 literally translated means ' loss of land results in twenty years when it is enjoyed by a stranger before the owner's very eyes and without any protest from him and loss of chattels ( resulte under similar circumstances) in ten years'. Manu VIII. 147-148 and Nārada IV. 79-80 have two verses in common which mean * If the owner of anything silently looks on (i. e. raises no protest) when it is being enjoyed in his presence for ten years by strangers he does not deserve to recover it (i.e. he loses the thing). When the owner is not an idiot nor a minor and his property is enjoyed within his sight then the property being lost by his conduct (vyavahāra ) comes to belong to the enjoyer', Gaut. XII. 34 has almost 456 the same words as Manu VIII. 148. Saṅkha (in V. R. p. 208) algo refers to ten years. These passages apparently mean that at the end of 20 or 10 years' adverse possession by the wrongful possessor the ownership of the original owner is lost and the wrongful possessor becomes the owner. But there are several other smṛti passages where it is said that possession even for a hundred years originating in wrong cannot confer title and much longer periods are required for the loss of ownership and the acquisition of ownership by prescription. Vide Nār. IV. 86-87 cited (on p. 318 above ). Nār. (IV. 89 ) himself says elsewhere that possession requires

By French Law the time of memory was held to extend for one hundred years as done by the Mit. and other Sanskrit digests. Vide Salmond's Jurisprudence (9th ed. of 1937) p. 265. note y.

Meaning of smārtakala 

321 

to be supported by title only during smārtakūla (during human memory), but in cases beyond human memory possession con tinued successively for three generations (or ancestors) is proof of ownership even in the absence of a document (or other title). Visnu Dh. S. V, 187 is in similar 457 terms. The Mit. on Yāj. (II. 27 ) says that smārtakāla is a period of 100 years, as the Veda declares that the span of a man's life is 100 years. For a hundred years it is possible for witnesses to depose to the origin of possession. So if there is possession for less than one hundred years, oral evidence can be adduced for establishing its origin, and title will have to be proved by the possessor and if no oral evidence is adduced to prove title, it is a case in which it may be held as certain that there was no title to begin with. Mere possession is not enumerated by sages like Gautama among the means of acquiring ownership. As the Sarasvati vilāsa (p. 124) puts it, long uninterrupted possession only leads to an inference that it originated in title acquired by sale, gift or the like i. e, there arises a presumption of lawful origin 458 Therefore in order to enable a man tu rely on possession alone us proof uf ownership it must extend uninterruptedly over 100 years (acc. to the Mit.). The Smrticandrika 459 (II. p. 72) accepts this nieaning, only requiring 105 years' possession in stead of 100 years'. Acc. to a smrti quoted by it each genera. tion means 35 years and so when Nārada requires possession for three generations 105 years are meant (acc. to Sm. C.). Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 187, Kāt. (327) also hold that continuous enjoyment for three generations makes the fourth generation owner of the land. Kāt. (321 g. by Mit. on Yāj. Il. 27, Apa rārka p. 636 ) states 'in cases falling within the memory of man it is desirable that possession must be accompanied with title

(in order to be proof of ownership as to land); but in cases beyond the memory of man possession extending over three generations in succession (is independent proof of ownership), since there is no certainty that there was no title (to begin with)'. Vide also Bṛ. (in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 313 verges 26-28). "Three generations' is a vague expression. The great-grandfather, the grandfather and the father of a man may die in the space of ten years and if the great-grandfather took possession wrongfully and all died within ten years of the time of taking possession one after another, the fourth in descent might urge that there was posses sion for three generations and that he had become owner, Therefore Kāt, in another verse (318, q. by Aparārka p. 636 and V. P. p. 155) laid down that unbroken possession for three generations extending over sixty years becomes firin ( indepen dent means of proof of ownership). Thus tripuruṣa-bhoga or purvakramāgatu-bhoga (in Yāj. II. 27 ) means the same thing as possession continuing from a time beyond human memory (asmārta-kāla) and is equal to 60 years acc. to Kāt., Vyāsa and a few other smṛti writers 469 Nārada (4. by Aparārka p. 636 ) says that as regards possession one generation means twenty years, while Br. (q. by Sm. C. II. p. 72) says it means thirty years. It will be noticed from the above that early authors like Gaut., Manu., Yāj. appear to lay down 20 years' adverse enjoy ment of land as sufficient to create ownership, while other and comparatively later authors like Nār. and Kāt. require sixty years enjoyment. In order to remove this conflict and following the maxim that apparently conflicting texts should be reconciled as far as possible, the writers of commentaries and digests froni Visvarūpa and Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 148) downwards proposed various interpretations of Yāj. II. 24 and similar texts. Some lay emphasis on possession and others on title. There are at least three explanations. Aparārka (pp. 631-632), Kullūka and Raghunandana take the literal sense and say that on 20 years' adverse possession there is loss of ownership (i. e. there

II. 24 is that after 20 years' enjoyment by a stranger, if the owner brings a suit and relies on a document in his favour, he runs the risk of being unable to prove his ownership barely on the strength of the docunent, since it is possible to argue that, even though he had a document, by his silence he acquiesced in the stranger taking possession and tacitly consented to it. Therefore all that Yāj. II. 24 means or recommends is that an owner should not be negligent (upekśā) or should not remain silent when a stranger takes wrongful possession. This view was first started by Visyariipa among extant writers and it approaches the modern idea of requiring vigilance in the asser tion of ones' rights 462 ; that is there is only loss of the suit (vyavahārahāni). This view lays emphasis on a verse attri buted to Nār. and the word vyuvahāra in it and in Manu VIII. 148 and Nārada IV. 80, where the word means lawsuit also, the idea being that the sages declare only what would happen or be decided by the judges in a law court and do not intend to say that the decision would be just or righteous from the higher or the moralist's point. The third view is that of the Mit. (followed by the Vyavahāramayukha, Mitramiśra and several others) which 163 oxplains that the loss is not that of the ownership of the thing itself but of the produce of it ( there is only phala hāni') i. e. if without protest the owner allows a stranger to remain in possession before his very eyes for twenty years and then he brings a suit, he inay succeed in getting back his land but he would lose his claim to the profits of the land. The Mit., the Vyavahāramātṛkā and V. P. (pp. 157-165) contain very

elaborate discussions on Yāj. II. 24; but considerations of space forbid any further reference to them. The V. M. 464 connects Yāj. II. 24 with the preceding verse (viz. that in mortgages, gifts and sales a prior transaction prevails over a later one) and reinarks that this verse (Yaj, II. 24) says that if a person after a gift, sale, or mortgage to him allows the property to remain with the seller, donor or mortgagor, who subsequently transfers it to another with possession and the latter holds it for twenty years, then the first dealing though prior is of no avail (as it is not accompanied with possession for 20 years). Srikara ( as stated in tho Vyavahāramātṇkā) tried to reconcile the conflicting smrti texts by holding that in twenty years the real owner lost ownership if he was present and did not protest while a stranger was in possession, but passages speaking about possession for throo generations (or sixty years ) applied only where the owner was absent. The Mit. and others point out that Yāj. II. 24 (who employs the words 'paśyatah' and 'abruvatah') conveys that if a stranger takes possession while the owner is absent or if the owner protests, then even 20 years' possession does not lead to the loss of anything. The text of Nār. IV. 87 quoted above (p. 318) shows that the sage held that possession for several hundr ed years aven would not avail the possessor if it is certain or established that the possessor had no title at all to begin with or that his possession started wrongfully. This text is empha sized by those who favour title and want to discourage persons benefiting by their own wrongdoing. But there are other smrti texts of a contrary tenor. For example, Nār. IV. 91 himself says 'whatever has been enjoyed even unlawfully for three generations (i. e, by three ancestors ) including the father cannot be recovered by the owner from the person (who is the 4th in succession) because it has gone through three lives in succession'; a text of Hārita states 'what has been enjoyed by three prior ancestors without any title whatever cannot be recovered back (from the present holder, who is th), since it has descended successively through three generations. These two are relied upon by those whe hold long possession as leading

Inference of title from long possession 

325 

to an inference of title (tripurusız-blunktivādinah, as Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 148 calls them). These like the Vyavahāra tattva and Vivādacandra 465 who rely solely on possession boldly say that long possession even originating in wrong leads to ownership. Medhātithi says 'there can be no memory of the origin of title when there has been possession for hundreds of years and (if title had to be proved for the origin of such possession) a king may resume villages enjoyed by ancient temples, brāhmaṇas and mathas; therefore ancient possession is evidence of ownership because it makes it extremely probable that the ancient possession originated in gift or the like'. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 27 (which is suuttavādi) refers to all the three views, refutes the first two and accepts the view of loss of profits. It does not literally interpret the texts of Harita and Nārada quoted above, takes them to be over-statements and intended to convey that continuous possession for over three generations cannot be interfered with even if there is no clear proof of the origin of title. In modern India under the Indian Limitation Act (IX of 1908) the tendency is to prescribe the very short period of twelve years for adverse possession in order to defeat a title, following the English Real Property Limita tion Act of 1833 (3 and 4 William IV chap. 27), sec, 2 of which insisting on vigilance by every one about one's rights however prescribes the period of 20 years within which to bring an action for recovery of land. Modern case law has rather gone too far and sets a premium on wrongful possession by holding that it is not necessary that adverse possession should have been brought to the knowledge of the real owner 466 Ancient Hindu lawyers put down the tendency to usurp another's property and placed many obstacles in the way of the wrongful possessor. 

It may be noted that there were a low raro toxts that referred to very short periods for possession causing loss of

title, viz. 3 years for immovable property (provided there was no permissive origin, hṣamālingn) or one year for corn, cattle and other movables 107. This idea being opposed to innumerable texts was explained away as merely conveying the great im portance of possession. Marici states 168 that cows, beasts of burden, ornaments that are borrowed through friendship should be returned within four or five years, otherwise the owner would lose them. This is opposed to Manu VIII. 146 and other texts and so is explained as being applicable only if there is no sufficient cause for allowing them to remain with the borrower. The ancient Roman Law was very like this. Before Justinian the Roman Law gave the ownership of a thing hy quiet posses nion bona fide and founded on good title if maintained during one year over movables and during two years over immovable property 69. Justinian altered this and provided that possession during three years gave ownership of movable' and possession during ten years ( if partios resided in the same province) (r during twenty years ( if they did not) gave the ownership of immovable property. 

Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 314 verse 31 ) lays down the proposi tion that if a person has title and is already in possession and is dispossessed by another then he may succeed in a lawsuit on the strength of his prior possession provided the dispossessor does not establish continuous possession for three generations 470. This is similar to a suit in ejectment contemplated by Art. 142 of the Indian Limitation Act. 

Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 310 v. 11) and Kāt. 335 ( both quoted by Aparārka p. 637, V. P. p. 166 ) state that what is enjoyed by a man's agnates and cognates and his own people does not pass to their ownership by their mere possession; one should regard

Cases where possession is ineffective

possession ( as leading to ownership ) in cases other than these. Pitāmaha states that possession by a stranger is powerful, but possession by members of one's own family has certainly not the same force 471. This appears to adumbrate the principle of modern law that possession by one co-owner or une tenant-in common is ordinarily the possession of all co-owners and the mere fact that the profits of a property have been enjoyed by only one co-heir or tenant-in-common for many years does not by itself amount to the ouster of the other tenants-in-common 472. It is stated in Gaut. XII. 35 that property which is enjoyed for a long time by a srotriya, an ascetic or a king's officer is not lost to the owner by that enjoyment, since the owner may have thought that he would reap long-enduring spiritual merit by the first two enjoying this property ( such as a vacant huuse) or that he might bo prevented from asserting his right from fear ( of the royal official) Compare Bṛ. ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 311 v. 12 ). 473 Manu VIII. 149 ( = Nār. IV. 81 and Vas. 16. 18), Yāj. 11. 25, Br. (S. B. E. 33 p.312 v. 21), Kat. (330) state the following exceptions to the rule of loss by long possession; il niortgaged or pledged property, boundary, minor's property, an upen deposit, a sealed deposit, women (female slaves ), the property of the king i, e. (of the State) and the property of it brāhmana learred in the Veda are not lost by the possession of another (for twenty or ten years referred to in Manu VIII, 147 and Yāj. II. 24). Manu VIII. 145 provides that neither a pledge nor a deposit can be lost by lapse of time and that both are recoverable even if they have remained long ( with the pledgee or depositee). Yāj. 11. 25 adds to the above list the properties of idiots and of women. Nār. IV. 83 uniphatically states that women's property (stri dhana) and state property (land) is not lost even after hundreds of years, when it is enjoyed without title. Kāt. (330) adds to the above list toniple property and what is inherited

from the father or mother 474 All systems of jurisprudence throw protection round the interests of minors, persons of un sound mind and others similarly situated and provide longer periods of possession for loss of their right. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 25 gives reasons why the several exceptions are made in the case of a pledge or mortgage the property is enjoyed by the pledgee or mortgagee under an agreement and so there is no fault on the part of the owner if he remains quiet while the property is being enjoyed by the creditor; boundaries between villages can be easily established by such signs as trees ( grow ing on the border ), streaky of chaff and coal (buried under ground ); deposits are entrusted to a person out of confidence for being preserved and not for enjoyment; idiots and minors are ignorant or incapable of understanding their rights; the king being engrossed in numerous state affairs may not be able in time tu look into the question about possession of state properties; women on account of their ignorance and timidity may not assert their rights and a learned brāhmana being devoted to learning, teaching and performance of rites and duties may have no time to go to law. In inodern times also the law favours minors and other persons as indicated in the note below 475. Kāt. (331-334 q. by Par, M. III. p. 148, Sm. C. II p. 69

Under the Indian Limitation Act, a mortgagor can sue for redemp tion and possession within 60 years from the time when the right to redeem accrues (Art. 148), though for ordinary suits for possession the period is 12 years; while a pawnor of moveable property has 30 years (Art. 145) from the date of the pawn; if a thing is entrusted to a man for a specific purpose as a trustee then sec. 10 of the Limitation Act provides that no length of time will bar a suit for recovering from him or his legal representatives or voluntary assigns the trust property or its proceeds (upanidhi and niksepa may be examples of trust); a suit on behalf of the Secretary of State for India can be brought within 60 years (Art. 149); sections 6-8 provide longer periods for persons who were minors, idiots or lunatics at the time when their rights were invaded. Under the Real Property Limitation Act of 1833 (3 and 4 William IV chap. 27 sections 16 and 17) a suit could be brought within ten years of the time when the disability ceased in the case of minors, lunatics, idiots, those absent beyond the seas, but no suit can be

CHAPTER XIII 

WITNESSES (saksinah). 

The word saksin occurs in the Svetasvataropanisad 76 (VI. 11) wliere it is applied tu the une immanent Spirit of the uni. verse as All-seving. Panini 477 V. 2. 91 explains the word sākṣin as meaning one who has directly seen'. Gaut. 478 XIII. 1, Kant. III. 11, Nar. IV. 147 state that when two persons litigate and there is a doubt or discrepancy between the two the deter mination of the truth in the dispute is due to witnesses. Manu VIII. 74, Sabhaparva 479 68,84, Nar. IV. 148, Vishu Dh. S. 8. 13, Kat. 346 (q. in V. M. p. 317 and V. P. p. 106) provide that a (proper) witness is one who has himself either seen or heard or experienced the matter in dispute. This means that the evidence of a witness must be direct and should not be what is called hearsay, Medhātithi (on Manu VIII. 74) says 480 that hearsay evidence occurs when a person who hears from another that has himself heard soinething from another coines forward as a witness and that hearsay is no legal evidence. Manu VIII. 76 prescribes that even though a man may not have been expressly asked or appointed by the parties (in the word:4 ' you are the witness to this transaction'), he is a proper witness when asked it to any matter in dispute that lie has himself seen or heard. The only exception to hearsay evidence ullowed by

the Visṇu Dh. S. VIII. 12 is that 481 when a person that is appoin ted as a witness is dead or gone abroad, those who have heard what he said may give evidence. It has already been stated. (p. 297) that a king was not to delay the examination of witnesses, Kāt. (340-341 q. by Aparārka pp. 675,677, Sm, C. II. p.92, V. M. p. 331) prescribes that the king (or the chief judge) should himself examino the witnesses that are present (in court) and should consider along with the sahlyas the statements made by witnesses and that, where it is doubtful who the witnesses on a disputed matter are, time should be given for producing the witnesses in order to ascertain the proper means of proof but that where it is clear who the witnesses may be he should make the hearing of the case proceed at once. Kāt. (352) further prescribes 482 that when it is impossible to bring witnesses because they reside in a foreign country, evidence taken in writing before a man learned in the three Vedas and sent by him should be read in deciding the cause 483 Gaut. 13. 2, Manu VIII. 60, Yāj. II. 69, Nār. IV. 153 and others require that ordinarily there should be at least three witnesses in a cause. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 301 v. 16 ) says that there may be nine, seven, five, four or three witnesses, or two only if they are learned brāhmaṇas 18 Viṣnu Dh. S. VIII. 5 and Bp. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 301 v. 16 ) emphasize that a single witness alone cannot be examined for deciding a matter 185.

But Yaj. II. 72, Viṣnu Dh. S. VIII. 9, Nār. IV. 192 state that one man alone may be a witness in a cause if he is endowed with the regular performance of his religious duties ( is possessed of the qualities stated in Viṣṇu Dh. S. VIII. 8) and is accepted as a witness by both sides. Vide Manu VIII. 77 also. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 301 v. 18) allows a single witness to furnish valid proof if he is a dūtaka 486 (messenger), an accountant, one who has accidentally witnessed the transaction or if he is the king or the chief justice. Vyāsa says 487 that even a single person may be enough in a cause, especially in heinous offences called sāhasa, if he be one whose actions are pure, who knows the dharma and whose truthfulness has been well attested before. Kaut. (III. 11 ) says that a single witness (whether a man or a woman) may be enough in cases where the transaction in question was effected in secret (except the king and one performing austerities ), 488 Kāt. (353-355 q. hy V, M. pp. 319-320, Sm. C. II. 76, V, P. pp. 112-113 ) states that even a single person may be allowed to depose as a witness if he was taken in confidence at the time of making a deposit; so also a messenger sent by a litigant for borrowing an article (such as an ornament) or the manufacturer of an article may alone be sufficient to prove the identity of the article or when a matter has been decided by the king or chief judge, the scribe, the chief justice or any one of the sabhyas may alone prove the plea of res judicatu or the point as to what was said by the plaintiff or the defendant in a suit 189, Vide Br, (S. B. E. 33 p. 300 verses 13-14). 

The qualifications of witnesses to be examined in a suit are stated in numerous places such as Gaut. XIII, 2, Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIIL 62-63, Vas. 16.28, Saṅkha-Likhita (q. in S. V, p. 138 ), Yāj.

The principal qualifications are ; 4894 they should be born of a good family, should have lived hereditarily in the country, should be householders having a son or sons, should be well-to-do and men of character, should be trustworthy, should know dharma and act up to it, should not be covetous and should have been cited by the parties as witnesses. Some Smrti texts such as Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIII. 68 ( = Kāt. 351 and Vas. 16.30), Kāt. 348 provide 490 that ordinarily witnesses should be of the same varna or caste as the parties, that women should be witnesses in disputes between women, that men of the lowest castes (rentyajas) should be witnesses for litigants of those castes and that a litigant of a lower caste should not try to prove his case by citing witnesses of a higher caste or a brāhmana (unless the latter is an attesting witness on a deed ). But most (even including Gaut. and Manu ) give an option and say that persons of all castes (even sūdras) may be witnesses for all. Vide Gaut. XIII. 3, Manu VIII. 69, Yāj. II. 69, Nār. IV. 154, Vas. 16.29 (sarveșu saria eru vā). Nār. 1V. 155 and Kāt. (349-50 9. by Aparārka p. 666 and V. P. pp. 111-112) provide 491 that in disputes between members of groups such as those who wear peculiar symbols (indicative of their sect), śrenis (guilds), pūgas (associations), companies of traders and all others who work in groups and who are therefore called ruryns and in the case of slaves, bards, wrestlers, elephant riders, horse-trainers and soldiers the heads (called ursin) of these groups are the proper witnesses. Gaut. XI. 21 says that in disputes among members of classes of agriculturists, traders, cowherds, money

Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIII. 65, Viṣnu Dh. S. VIII. I and several others say that the king cannot be cited as a witness 495 ( except possibly to prove the plea of res judicata or to prove what transpired before him when a litigation was going on ). 

The above is a formidable list of incompetent witnesses ; therefore, most Smrtis such as Gaut, XIII. 9, Kauṭ. III. 11, Manu VIII. 72, Yāj. II. 72, Nār. IV. 188-189, Viṣnu Dh. S. III. 6, Uśanas (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 79), Kāt. 365-366 ( 9. in Sm. C. II. p. 79) expressly point out that strict examination of the character of witnegges should be entered upon in disputes about debts and 

494, In Omichand v. Barker ( Willes 1737-1860 p. 538 ) where Willes (Lord Chief Justice) says (at p. 551) that in Popish times and for some little time afterwards till the Reformatiop was fully established there was a notion that 'even an alien friend especially if he were an infidel could not sue in a court of justice here'. That shows how non-Christians found it difficult to sue in England for their just rights a few centuries back. In the case cited above Lord Chief Justice Willes had to deliver an elaborate judg ment ia 1745 for holding that evidence taken in India according to the oaths administered to non-Christian witnesses could be read in a trial beld in England. So one need not laugh at Nār, who flourished at least about 1200 years before that date if he held an atheist or an apostate to be an incom peteot witness. It should be noted that 'By the canon Law a jew is not admitted to give evidence against a Christian, especially if he be a clergyman;' vide Taylor on Evidence (ed, of 1848, p. 655 note C.)

the like which are of a fixed nature (of a civil nature ), but that in complaints about all kinds of sāhasa ( heinous crime), in robbery, adultery or the two kinds of pārusya ( viz. defama tion and assault) there should be no (strict) inquiry into the character of witnesses (that is, all can be witnesses in such cases) and that even those like slaves and fault-finders who have been enumerated among incompetent witnesses can become witnesses in grave matters 4%. The idea is that in such cases the witnesses need not be strictly examined as to their possess ing the good qualities ordinarily required in witnesses. But this does not authorize the examination of such persons as lunatics or idiots as witnesses, because they have not the power to understand things. Manu VIII. 77 emphatically states that even a single male, if he is free from greed, may be (suffi cient as ) a witness, but not women of good character, even though they be many, since the feminine intellect is apt to be unsteady. But even Manu had to concede (VIII. 70) that a woman or a minor or a very old person or a pupil, relative, slave or a hired servant may be a ( competent) witness, if it is impossible to find another witness (in matters that occurred inside a house or in a forest or in crimes where life is lost). Kat. 367 (g. by Aparārka p. 671) says the same thing. Usanas497 (quoted in the Sm. C. II. p. 79, V. P. p. 120) provides that even a slave, a blind man, a deaf person, a leper, a woman, a minor, a very old man may be ( competent) witnesses in sāhasa, provided they are not interested in the matter of dispute (or are not related or partial to the parties). Nar. (IV. 190 191) gives it as his view that even when there is to be no strict inquiry into the character of witnesses in sāhasa, still a minor, a woman, a single person, one who forges deeds (or who is a

cheat), a relative and an enemy cannot be witnesses in sāhasa, since a child through ignorance, a woman from her habit of untruthfulness, a forger (or cheat) because he is accustomed to doing evil deeds, a relative from affection and an enemy from the idea of taking revenge may speak falsely. There was no total disqualification of women as witnesses, since Manu quoted above allows them to be witnesses in disputes between women and in cases where it is not possible to have other witnesses. Medhā - tithi on Manu VIII. 68 holds that women are. disqualified as witnesses only where the plaintiff and defendant are both males but that where there is a litigation between a man and a woman or between women alone, a woman may be a competent witness. Ancient Hindu Law is not singular in its partial rejection of the testimony of women, Vide Best on Evidence (12th ed. of 1922) pp. 53-56 where it is shown how ancient Roman Law and the Medieval laws of several countries of Europe more or less excluded the testimony of women, how some States in the U.S.A. excluded the testimony of negroes and persons of coloured blood. By the Canon Law more credit was given to male than female witnesses ( Taylor on Evidence, ed. of 1848 p. 655, 

noted). 

Nar. (IV. 157-172) states that incompetent witnesses fall into five classes : (1) some t98 like learned brahmanas, very old men, ascetics, persons practising austerities are incompetent because ancient texts ( vacana) say so and there is no other (special) reason for their exclusion.

Five classes of incompetent witnesses 

339 

(p. 214 ) points out that śrotriyas and others cannot be appoint ed as witnesses, but they may be what is called akyta witnesses explained below (i. e. they may if they choose appear as witnesses in a cause ). They are not competent like the king, not because they are untrustworthy but because it is not advisa. ble to call them. They were privileged persons; (2) thieves, robbers, dangerous characters, gamblers, assasins are declared to be incompetent because there is the defect (doṣa) of untruth fulness in them; (3) witnesses are rendered incompetent on the ground of contradiction (bheda), when the statement of wit nesses who have been accepted by the king for determination of the same matter do not agree; (4) he who without having been appointed (by the parties to a transaction ) as a witness (to it) comes of his own accord to depose is termed a sūci (i. e. & spy) in the sāstras (and so was styled svayamukti by Nār. IV. 157) and is unworthy to be a witness; (5) a person is incompetent as a witness by reason of intervening death (i. e. he is mstāntara ); when can any person bear testimony if the creditor (or claimant) is no longer alive, whose claim should have been heard by him specifically (but was not heard in that way )? Mītāntara is a witness whom one or other of the parties informed in a general way that there was some dealing between the parties and who was asked to be a witness ( but was not told the details of the dealing ) and then subsequently the party died. In such a case the person told is not a good witness, as he cannot give the details. But Nār. (IV. 94 ) mentions an exception to this last rule viz. when a father while on the point of death tells his sons and the like these are the witnesses on such and such a matter,' there even after the father's death those witnesses would be competent though death intervenes. 

Witnesses are divided by Nār. IV. 149 into two sorts ; (1) those appointed (kyta) by the parties and (2) those not appointed (akrta); the first being of five kinds and the last of six kinds. The first five ( acc. to Nār. IV. 150 ) are a subscrib ing witness (likhita), one who has been reminded (smārita ) 1. e. one who is called as a witness without there being a docu ment and who is present at a transaction and is again and again reminded of it by a party to it in order that the transaction may be effectively proved thereafter ( Kāt. 371 and 372 q. in Mit. on Yaj. II. 68 ), a casual witness i, e. one, who, while a transaction is being entered into, comes there by mere chance and is then asked to be a witness (yadrochabhijiā or yādṣcchika, 

340 

History of Dharmasastra 

| Vol. 

acc. to Br. ), a secret witness i, e, one who is made to listen to the speech of the debtor while concealed behind a wall or soreen, an indirect (uttara )499 witness (i. e. one who learns from a witness who has seen or heard of a transaction when the latter is going to a distant country or is on the point of death ). The six akrta witnesses (acc. to Nār. IV. 151-152) are co-villagers (in disputes about boundaries), the chief judge, the king (before whom a suit was tried), one who is closely acquainted with the transaction of the parties (i.e, kūryamadhyagata, acc. to Bs.), one who is deputed by a party (for borrowing an ornament or for settling a transaction, called dutaka by Br. ), members of the family (kulya) in disputes among other members of the family (as regards partition &c.). Bṛ. mentions twelve kinds of witnesses that are practically the same as the eleven of Nār. except one which he adds viz. lekhita 500 (one whose name is caused to be written by a party in the presence of the witness when that party enters into some transaction in writing such as a loan with another). The only difference between 'likhita' and 'lokhita' seems to be that the first himself writes his own name as a witness on a document while the latter's name is written as a witness by one party in the presence of the other and of the witness. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 299 verses 4-15 q. by Aparārka pp. 666-667) defines at great length all the twelve and Kat. also defines most of them, but these defini tions are passed over as not very important. Viśvarūpa remarks that these nice distinctions among eleven kinds of witnesses are made only for the sake of exposition and for the benefit of simple people 507

Shaking the credit of a witness 

341 

Before a witness for a party begins to depose, it is the duty of the opposite party to point out the ground or grounds, if any, of the incompetence of the witness put forward for examination, Kāt. adds 502 that the latent defects of the witnesses of a party must be pointed out by the opposite party, but the patent defects will be considered by the members of the court at the time of giving their decision. Vyasa 503 states the defects of the witnesses of a party should be pointed out by the opponent in open court by putting them down in writing and the wit nesses should be called upon (by the judge) to refute them; if the witnesses admit (the faults pointed out) they do not deserve to be witnesses; if otherwise (if the faults are not admitted) they should be established by the opponent with evidence (other than those of other witnesses ); for if the defects of the witnesses of a party were allowed to be established by other witnesses to be cited by the opponent, there would result the fault of a never-ending series (anavasthā), since the first party would then try to show defects in the latter set of witnesses and this may have to be carried on ad infinitum.' Bṛ. laid down that an opponent should not be allowed to point out the grounds of incompetency in witnesses after they have begun to depose and Kat. adds 504 that he (that party), who points out, after the witnesses have deposed to a matter, faults in them in whom he found none at first and who can not set out a proper reason (for his not proclaiming the faults at first) should be fined in

Br. further states sos that-the defendant may point out the defects, if they exist, in the witnesses oited by the plaintiff; but if he finds faults which do not exist in the witnesses, he should be punished with a fine equal to the amount claimed (in monetary disputes) or equal to that which is levied from a false witness. If the witness of a party is not able to refute the defect pointed out by the opponent, the party calling him should try to clear his witness of the fault; other wise he should not succeed in his suit. 

When a witness is about 506 to depose, he was, acc, to Br. (S. B.

Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 7. says 507 that a witness should depose to the truth on an auspicious day in the morning in the presence of kindled fire and near (a jar of) water in the hall presided over by the king (or chief justice) and after being exhorted as regards both (viz. the results of truthfulness and falsehood) and when accepted by all (the court and parties ) as a competent witness. Kaut. also (in III. 11 ) says that wit nesses should be examined in the presence of brāhmaṇas, water jar and fire. Manu (VIII. 79-80) provides that the judge should in a conciliatory manner exhort all witnesses assembled inside the court in the presence of the plaintiff and defen dant as follows: 'whatever acts of these two (litigants) between themselves you know as regards this matter (in dispute ), narrate them all truthfully, since you are the witnesses in this case'. Yaj. II. 73 also states that witnesses should be made to depose in the presence of the parties and Gaut. XIII. 13 and Kāt. (q. by Mit. on Yaj. II, 73) prescribe that witnesses sos

should face the east or north, are to be examined in the presence of the images of gods and brāhmaṇas in the first half of the day and should be exhorted to tell the truth by being bound with oaths. This examination in the public and after an oath went a long way in checking the tendency to depose falsely. The oath consisted of two parts, viz. (1) the requirement to tell the truth and (2) the exhortatory and imprecatory part. Both were administered by the presiding judge. Gaut. (XII. 12-13) appears to prescribe that an oath (sapatha) was not to be administered to brāhmaṇa witness, but Manu VIII. 113 ( Nār. IV. 199) does not make this distinction. Gaut. (XIII. 14-23), Manu VIII. 81-86, 89-101, Viṣnu Dh. S. VIII. 24-37, Nar. IV. 201-228 contain very long exhortations addressed by the judge to the witnesses relating to the importance and high worth of truth, stating how the conscience of a man pricks him, what rewards await the truthful witness here and in the next world and what sin and terrible torments in Hell are the lot of an untruthful witness, what evil befalls even the deceased ancestors of an untruthful witness and how he is liable to be punished by the king. They are too long to be cited here 509, Shorter exhorta tions are found in Yaj. II. 73-75, Vas 16. 32-34, Baud. Dh. 8. I. 10. 19. 9-12 (8. B. E. vol. XIV p. 203), Bp. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 301 verses 19-22), Kāt. 343. Nār. IV. 200 provides 'let him (the judge ) inspire them (the witnesses ) with awe by (quoting ) ancient texts, extolling the greatness of truth and denouncing falsehood'. Kaut. (III. 11), Manu VIII. 88 and 113 (=Nar. IV. 199), Viṣnu Dh. S. VIII. 20-23 add further modes of speech and exhortations according to the varna of the witness: A brahmana witness is to be addressed by the judge as 'speak' and to be exhorted to swear by his veracity, a ksatriya one was to be addressed as 'speak the truth' and to be sworn by the animal he rides and his weapons ( which he is to touch ), a vaisya ia to be sworn by his kine, grain and gold and a sūdra is to be sworn by (imprecating on his head) all grave sins. Manu VIII. 88 provides that a brāhmana should be asked to depose

with the word 'speak', while VIII, 113 states that a brāhmana is to be made to swear by his truth. Some explain that the first rule applies to excellent brāhmaṇas and the second to inferior ones and rely on Gaut. (XII. 12-13 ) who prescribes that an oath to speak the truth is not to be administered to brahmanas but only to others. Vide Haradatta on Gaut. and Vivādacandra p. 127. Manu VIII. 102 (Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 95 ) is careful to point out that the exhortation is not to depend purely on the caste but that brāhmaṇas (and others ) who tend kine, who engage in trade, who are craftsmen or actors, who are menial servants and usurers should be treated (by the judge) as sūdras 511 (in the matter of taking oaths). Witnesses after they are assembled before the Court are to be ordinarily examined separately (vide Kāt. quoted in n. 508 above). But Gaut. XIII. 5 and Kat, 394 provide 5'2 that if a certain matter is seen by the witnesses as a body then they may be examined together. Manu VIII. 78 and Kat. 392 prescribe that what the witnesses declare quite natu rally (without hesitation and fear) should be taken down and that when the witnesses have declared (what they know) they should not be questioned again and again by the king (or judge). From the Smrtis and the 9th Act of the Mșcchakaṭika it appears that 

511. The Mit, on Yaj. II. 73 explains Manu VIII, 113 as follows: a brābmapa witness is to be sworn by being told that if he spoke untruth his truth will perish, a ksatriya that his vehicle and arms will be fruitless, a vaisya that his cattle, grain and gold will be lost and a sūdra that all sins will be his lot. Others explain differently. The Vyavahāratattva p. 215 says 

MANTEATR Tegri TUTTATHUra Faria e uri. The i t on Tr. II. 74 says the same. Med hātithi on Manu VIII, 113 appears to hold that the exhortatory part is repeated by the witness.

III, 1 and Manu II, 168 provide that brāhmaṇas who have not studied the Veda, who do not expound it or do not keep the sacred fires be come equal to śūdras.

Cross examination 

345 

it was the chief judge or the judges who put questions and that there was no elaborate cross-examination and re-examina tion of witnesses as in England ( which practice is followed in modern India ). The only cross examination that appears to have been allowed was about the faults or grounds that made a person an incompetent witness. In this respect ancient Indian practice resembled modern judicial practice in some European513. countries other than England. Witnesses were compelled to attend. Kaut. III. 11 states that witnesses who are not far removed by time or space should be produced by the parties themselves, but those who are far away or who are unwilling to stir sball be got summoned by order of the king 514 Manu VII. 107, Yāj. II. 77, Br., Kāt. and Viṣṇu Dh. S. VIII. 37 say that if a witness knowing all facts and not prevented from coming by disease or similar causes refuses to come as a witness he incurs the sin of false witness, has to pay the amount in dispute and ten per cent thereof as fine to the king. This is in accor dance with the principle enforced in modern times that it is the duty of a citizen to appear before a court of justice when. summoned. Kaut. (III. 1) provides for subsistence allowance to witnesses. It is not quite clear whether parties could be regarded under ancient Hindu Law as competent witnesses on their own behalf. Yāj. (II. 13-15) appears to suggest that. parties could be regarded as witnesses in their own cause and held to be false from their demeanour as in the case of witnesses. Kaut. IV.515 8 and the 9th Act of the Mrochakatika show that the accused was questioned by the Court as to his movements about the time of the alleged offence and till his arrest. Sukra 516

XII, where on p. 431 he remarks .cross examination is a highly characteristic part of an English trial, whether civil or criminal, and hardly any of the contrasts between the English and continental systems strikes an English lawyer so forcibly as its absence in the continental system.'

IV: 5.-184 defines siksi in such a way as to exclude the litigant himself. Ordinarily witnesses were examined in the open court in the présence of the parties and never behind their back, but Kat. (387-389) prescribes that in the case of immovable property oral evidence may be taken on the property itself and in some cases even elsewhere than these two (viz. the Court and immovable property ), that is, in the case of the death of living beings witnesses may be made to depose before the corpse (of the animal killed ) or, in the absence of the body, before $17 some niark ( such as the horn of an animal). Bṛ, and Manu VIII. 25 state that the truth of the statements of witnesses should be examined by marking their tone, their change of colour, their eyes, their gestures, and their deineanour518 Texts like Saṅkha. Likhita (4. by V. P. p. 124 ), Nār. IV. 193-196, Vispu Dh. S. VIT, 18, Yaj. II. 13-15 and Kāt. 386 point out the actions and appearances of a party or witness that deposes falsely, viz. he appears restless, changes his place (i.e. Inoves from one spot to another), licks the corners of his lips, his forehead perspires, his face loses colour, he frequently coughs and heaves frequent sighs, he scratches the ground with his feet (tues ), waves his hands and garment, his mouth becomes dry and his voice falters, he speaks incoherently, talks too much though not asked and does not reply straight to the questions asked and avoids meeting the eyes of the questioner. Such a witness may be looked upon as untrue and the king or judge should bring him under discipline (so that he will be afraid to lie). Merely on seeing these signs a witness was not to be punished or entirely disbelieved, since these signs raise only a probability of untruthfulness ( as remarked by Mit. on Yāj. 11. 15 and V. P. pi 124).

those who are 

hore disinterested 

le meritorious 

When there are many witnesses but they differ in their statements certain rules are laid down by Manu VIII. 73 (=Viṣṇu Dh. 8. VIII. 39), Yāj. II. 78, Nār. IV. 229, Bf. (8. B. E. vol. 38 p. 303 v. 35 ), Kāt. ( 408 ). They are briefly these : 519 The statement of the majority of witnesses should be accepted, but if they are equally divided then the statement of those who are more pure (in character or more disinterested ) should be accepted and if the meritorious are divided equally then those who are the best among them should be accepted as true. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 78 adds that if there is a conflict of testimony between the statements of a few but eminently qualified witnesses on the one hand and those of a larger number of ordinary witnesses, then the former should be accepted as Yāj. II. 7% requires i. e. it prefers quality to mere numbers. Kaut. III. 11 prescribes that when there is conflict in the oral evidence the decision should be according to the evidence of the inajority of witnesses or of those who are pure in character or of those who are approved of by both sides as good witnesses or a mean should be drawn from their statements. Nār. IV. 160 and Kāt. 359 state 520 that if one out of the (three) witnesses attesting a docu ment or out of (three ) witnesses that aro cited by a party deposes in a way contradictory to what is deposed to by the other twn, then all the three become incompetent witnesses on account of contradiction. This has been interpreted by the Vyavabāra. mitrkā (p. 326 ) to mean that where all witnesses are of equal status and there is a majority of only one favouring one side, then all the witnesses are incompetent and oral evidence is in that case futile for decision. 

The important question is how much has to be proved by the party calling witnesses. Yāj. II. 79 (=Visṇu Dh. S. VIII. 38), Nār. II. 27 and Br. (q. by Sm. C. II. 91 ) state the general rule that that party whose averments are supported in their entirety as true by the witnesses becomes successful, while that litigant

whose claim is declared by them to be false certainly loses $21. Nār. IV. 232 and 234, Kāt. 396, 398 lay down 52 the rule that in civil disputes that are of a non-urgent nature (like recovery of debts ), if witnesses depose to more or less ( than what is averred in the plaint), then the claim is not established in its entirety; where the witnesses depose to more or less ( than the claim affirmed by the party) the deposition of the witnesses should be considered as not taken down or it should be omitted (from consideration ) 523; the witnesses in such a case are not liable to fine; they may deserve to be fined if they do not depose ( to what they know). Similarly Nār. IV. 233 and Kat. 524 399 say. that where the depositions of witnesses are in conflict as to the place, the time, the property, the amount, the colour, the species (or caste ), the form (or shape ), the age ( as stated in the pleading of a party ), the depositions are to be regarded as good as not given at all. The rule amounts to this that any dis crepancy between the essential details or particulars of a claim

523. The maxim (in Yaj. II. 20) that on proof a part of a claim the whole may be held to be proved (vide above n 431) applies only where the opponent totally denies every item of the claim of the plaintiff. This is a presumption and the king or judge is not to be blamed for acting upon it in case of toraj donial, as said by Gaut. XI. 23 and 32 ' Urut UTA

II: 20)'in claims coataining several items, the creditor (or plaistiff) secures a decree for as much out of them as he is able to establish by means of witnesses'. These two verses are sought to be reconciled in various ways by the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 20), the Sm. C. II. pp. 120-121, Vyavabāra-mātṇkā pp.310-312 (where it criticizes the views of Yogloka), V.P., pp. 98-102. It is impossible for want of space to go into these interpretat ious. The Mit says that Kāt. 473 applies to a case where the son or the jiko being igaorant of the debis contracted by his father or the like says 'I do not know' i.e. pleads ignorance. In that case he does not deny (he is not Hihnava-vādin but only ajfūnin. The Vyavahāranirnaya p. 68 ex plains Kāt. 473 in the same way and about 396 it adds that when he cites witacsses as supporting his entire claim and the witnesses depose only to a. part of it or to more than he avers then his claim fails in its entirety but in sāhasa, theft and adultery it is otherwise.

made in the plaint (such as the time, place, number &c.) and the case made out in the depositions as to any of these: essential particulars will have the same consequence as tendering no oral evidence. This rule was not followed to the letter and besides other means of proof could be resorted to, as stated by the Mit., the Vivādacandra and others 525, Kaut. III. 11 526 states that when the witnesses depose to less than what is averted in the plaint, the plaintiff has to pay a fine (of a fifth part) on the excess and when they depose to more than the claim, the excess (held proved on the depositions ) may be taken by the king. 

• In charges of adultery, heinous crimes (sāhasa ) and theft the whole of the matter that is alleged may be held proved, when witnesses depose to only a part of the matter 527 (says Kat. 397). 

Nārada IV. 165 prescribes that a litigants28 should not secret ly approach a witness cited by his opponent, nor should he try to win him over (by bribes or threats) through another; if he does so, he would suffer the consequences of a losing party (hina)... 

There were rules about the late production of evidence. It has been already shown how if a litigant adduces weak evidence, though strong evidence is available, he would not be allowed to rely on the latter after judgment is pronounced. It is said by Nār. I. 62 that when a lawsuit has proceeded far enough (lit, has been cleansed or thrashed out), evidence such as a

document or witnesses, would then become useless, if that evidence had not been announced before 529 After a reply is filed by the defendant, the plaintiff has to give a list of his evidence i. e. documents or witnesses (Yaj. II. 7). The meaning briefly is as follows: If he does not do so, proceeds with the trial and does not call all necessary witnesses or produce all documents and the case is almost finished, but judgment is not pronounced, even then he would not be allowed to produce fresh evidence at that late stage. For if fresh evidence not previously disclosed were allowed to be given at that late stage, it would cause surprise to the defendant, who would then demand time for adducing evidence in rebuttal and then the plaintiff may again cite further evidence and this process is in danger of being carried on ad infinitum. If however witnesses were already cited but all were not examined (e. g. if ten witnesses were mentioned and only three examined) and the plaintiff found that the evidence of the few witnesses examined for him is contradictory or hostile, then he may be allowed to produce even at a late stage the remaining witnesses ( who may be seven i. e, double the number of those already examined or who may be more respectable or purer in character ). This proposition is contained in Yaj. II. 80 on which the Mitakṣarā remarks that even if witnesses are not mentioned in a list, but before judgment is pronounced other more reliable or respectable witnesses or double in number (and of the same status as ) of those examined are available, they should be examined by the court even at a late stage. The rule is that as long as witnesses are available resort to ordeals should not be had. Yāj. II. 80 also has given rise to various interpretations. Vide Mit. and Aparārka on Yaj. IL 80, Sm. C. II. p. 94, V. P. p. 130-134. The Mit. thinks that the verse applies where the plaintiff or the party on whom lies the burden of proving a positive proposition finds that the witnesses pro duced by him are hostile or contradictory and that in such a case he may be allowed to cite other more respectable or more numerous witnesses to prove his proposition and to show that the first set of witnesses is false, while Apararka holds that the verge says that when the party who has to prove his

case oites witnesses which the opponent feels are falso, tha opponent may produce more respectable or more numerous witnesses to depuse to the contrary and he would thus provo the first set to be false. Aparārka relies on Kāt. (408) for this proposition $30. It may be said that Aparārka's interpretation appears more natural. V. P. (p. 134 ) accepts Kātyāyana, but Bays that the interpretation of the Mit. ( of Yaj. II. 80 ) is correct.' Whatever view is accepted it leads to this that one set of witnesses not only may prove the truth of a party's case but also establish that another set of that party's witnesses are guilty of perjury. 

Yaj. II. 82 provides that if a witness, having promised with other witnesses to depose to a state of things, denies at the time of his examination that he saw the matter in dispute, he should be fined eight times the amount that a defeated litigant would have to pay and a brāhmaṇa witness similarly guilty if unable to pay may be banished (or his house should be razed to the ground). Nār. IV. 197 says that such a person is worse than a false witness. Manu VIII. 107, Yāj. II. 76, and Kāt. ( 405 ) pres cribe that if a person who has witnessed a transaction does not depose (1. e. remains silent) about it, though not suffering from disease or some other calamity, he should be made (after waiting for three fortnights) to pay the amount of the debt or other matter in dispute and also one-tenth thereof as fine to the king. 

After the witnesses have deposed the chief justice and sablıyas have to consider the depositions of witnesses ( as Kat. 340 provides ) $31, The Court has to find out which set of wit nesses are to be believed and what witnesses are perjured. Perjury entailed, according to dharmaśāstra works, both secular and other-worldly consequences. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 11.29. 8-9) states: 'When a witness deposes falsely the king should fine him and, in addition, the witness incurs hell after death' and Gaut. provides (XIII: 7 and 23), 'a witness telling the truth goes to heaven, but falls into hell if he does the reverse and when he deposes falsely he is to be censured and fined'. Manu VUI. 118 states that witnesses depose falsely through covetousness,

wrong Ideas, fear, friendship, sexual passion, wrath, ignorance and minority and prescribes (VII. 120-122) varying finos for. perjury arising from these several causes. Bļ. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 301 v. 21) regards 532 a corrupt judge, a perjured witness and the murderer of a brahmaṇa as equally sinful. Yaj. II. 81 and Kat. (407) prescribe 533 that the litigant who procures perjured evidence and the witnesses guilty of perjury should each be separately fined double the amount of the fine prescribed for defeat in various disputes and a brāhmana (guilty of doing the same) should be banished from the country 534 (but not fined). But when a person (of any of the three castes other than brāh mana) is frequently guilty of perjury he should be fined and given physical punishment (as cutting the tongue or death) and a similarly guilty brāhmaṇa should be fined and banished (or degraded by being carried naked through the streets or deprived of his house ). The Mit. on Yaj. II. 81 says that when Manu prescribes (VIII. 380) that a brāhmana guilty of a sin is not to be awarded death or corporal punishment and that he is to be banished with all his wealth, he refers to the brāhmaṇa being a first offender and not a confirmed one. Manu VIII. 108 says * where within seven days from deposing in a cause a (serious or painful) disease or fire or the death of a relative befalls a witness, he should be (being held as a false witness owing to these portentous happenings ) made to pay the debt in dispute to the opposite side and a fine to the king.' The Sm. C. (II. p. 94) explains that this applies to a witness who is the only one on a disputed matter such as a messenger and the king or judge should wait for seven days to see whether any of these calamities befalls that witness and then hold him to be perjured. Kāt. (410) contains 535 a similar rule, but he states that the king should wait one, two or three weeks or up to 45 days according to the value of the matter in dispute and the caste of the deponent. Manu VIII 117 (=Viṣnu Dh. S. VIII. 40) prescribes that in

Gaut. 13. 24-25, Vas. 16. 36, Manu VIII. 104, Yāj. II. 83, Viṣnu Dh. S. VII. 15 prescribe that a witness may depose falsely in a cause when, if he were to speak the truth, a person of the four yarnas is liable to suffer the sentence of death, Manu VIII. 105-106, Vāj. II. 83. Vispu Dh. S. VIII. 16 prescribe that as a penance for the falsehood a witness of the three higher castes may offer three oblations of boiled rice to the goddess of speech (Sarasvati) or he may offer into fire clarified butter with the mantras called Kūṣmānda (Vaj. S. XX. 14-16 or Tai A. X. 3-5), or with the three verses beginning with 'yaddevā deyahedanam' or with the verse sacred to Varupa (viz. Rg, I.. 24. 15, 'uduttamam varupa') or with three verses of which waters' are the deity (Rg. X. 9.1-3. apo hi stha )'. Vispu Dh. S. VIII. 17 adds that a sūdra guilty of perjury in the above case may by way of expiation feed ten cows for one day. It is strange that the dharmaśāstra works should permit perjury to save a culprit from being sentenced to death. Probably popular sentiment of old standing allowing the speak ing of falsehood in certain cases was responsible for this. In the Mahābhārata frequent reference is made to the permission to speak untruth in ordinary life when one's own life or another's life is in imminent danger. Vide Santi 536 45. 35, 109. 19. It is stated in Santi 165. 30 that speaking falsely is not a sin in five cases viz. in jest, to women, at the time of (i.e. in bringing about) a marriage, for the preservation of great wealth and for one's life. Vas. 16. 36 mentions those five occasions somewhat differently. Vide Manu VIII. 112 also for a similar rule. But bo old a sage as Gaut. ( 23. 29) implies that he disapproves of this sentiment 537, when he states, according to some falsehood entails no fault (i. e. no expiation need be performed) in (bringing about or breaking promises made at)

Nār. (IV. 235-236 ) states that when through 538 the caren lessness of the creditor (who dies ) there is no document nor witness to prove a dabt and the defendant denies it, then one of three methods (of proof) may be resorted to, viz. codanā pratikūlam ( Cunning the debtor each time to repay ), yuldtilega (putting forth arguments) and sapathu (special oaths and ordeals)538. Kat. (233 q. by Sm. C. IL. p. 52 and Par. M. III. 91) has a similar verse. Yukti according to Nārada IV. 238 means $39 * the creditor should follow ( the debtor) by arguments and by himself remembering and by reminding the debtor of the time, the place, the relation (subsisting between the two)'. Others. interpret yukti differently, that is, it means 'logical reasoning Kāt. (214) defines 540 'yukti' as 'the ascertainment or know ledge of a linya' (i. e. a sign that leads on to an inference ).

P. p. 168 appear to read' चोदनाप्रतिकालश्च (equal to चोदना+अप्रतिकाल) and interpret 'if there is no denial or protest (by the debtor) when the cre ditor frequently demands the debt, then the court may presume that he is a debtor'.

Circumstantial evidence 

355 

It is stated by Bphaspati that anumāna ( inference 541 or pre sumption ), as a means of deciding a law suit, is of three kinde, but it is inferior to witnesses ( vide note 433 above). Vyāga (q. by Sm. C. II. p. 95) states that anumāna is the same as hetu and tarka. V. P: (p. 167) remarks that (long continued) possession and the frequent urging by the creditor both lead to the inference of title and the taking of a loan respectively and are therefore to be comprehended under yukli according to the definition of Kātyāyana. Yet by popular usage yukli is res tricted to presumptions arising from certain circumstances on the analogy of the maxim of 'goballvarda' explained below under steya'. Yukti therefore means circumstantial evidence from which an inference may be drawn about a fact in issue in a judical poceeding. Ap. Dh. 542 S. II. 11. 29. 6 says that in case of doubt (judges ) should decide from signs (i. e. by inference ) or divine proof ( ordeals). Vas. 19. 39 mentions the view of some sages that one who is found armed or wounded or in possession of thë booty (stolen ) may be declared to be ( the thief or offender). Manu IX. 270 (=Matsya 227.166 ) requires the just king not to condemn to death one accused of theft unless his guilt is proved as certain by proof that the accused had in his possession the articles stolen and tools for theft (for house-breaking). "An adulterer is proved 513 to be so by being caught in such acts as playing with the hair of another's wife, an incendiary by being caught with a firebrand in his hand ( near the house set on fira), a murderer by being found ( near the murdered man) armed and a thief when caught with some of the articles stolen in his possession -Bay Saṅkba-Likhita 544

Kaut. 545 IV. 12 and Yaj. II. 283 similarly say that adultery may be inferred from ( the man and woman) being caught in the act of dalliance with the hair or from the signe left (such as marks of nails or teeth on the lips, check &c.) after carnal enjoyment or from the admission of the woman concerned (or of both ). Nār. (IV. 172-175) declares that there are six kinds of disputes in which the indications (or circumstances) themselves serve as witnesses and lead to a conclusion without the testimony of witnesses viz. one found with a fire-brand in his hand (near the scene of arson ) may be inferred to be the incendiary, one armed 546 ( found near the scene of murder ) as the murderer, one caught dallying with the hair of another's wife as an adulterer, one with a spade in his hand near a breached embankment as the person who caused the breach in it and one armed with an axe as the feller of a tree, a person guilty of an assault may be inferred to be go from visible signs (such as his club or sword being smeared with blood). But Nār. IV. 176 gives the warning that in such cases it is necessary to be careful in arriving at a conclusion, since a person in order to bring into trouble another whom he hates may create marks of injury on himself. Kāt. (337-338 ) further provides 557 that where one litigant proves as against his opponent (such as a debtor) either the offer of a bribe, or the effacing of the meang of recognition (such as effacing one's signature on a document) or holding out tempta tions (to the witnesses or sabhyas ) or the concealment of his wealth (to avoid its being attached in execution of a decree ), there the original claim (such as a debt) may be presumed to be proved oven if he (the opponent) denies his liability.

Dangers of circumstantial evidence 

357 

Judges often repeat from the Bench the words ' witnesses may lie, but circumstances cannot'. But this 80-called maxim is often dangerous. Circumstantial evidence leads to conclusionis that are in several instances false. The ancient Hindu lawyers were quite aware of the dangers of drawing inferences from circumstantial evidence. Nārada's warning has already been mentioned (p. 356). Kauṭ. 548 ( in IV. 8 ) remarks: 'even one not a thief may by chance be on the way by which thieves pass and one meeting thieves is seen to be apprehended as a thief because he is mixed up in dress, arms and articles carried with the thieves or is found near the articles stolen, just as Mandavya though not a thief declared himself to be a thief for fear of being subjected to torture; therefore (the king ) should punish one only after thorough examination'. Māndavya's is a leading case on the danger of relying on purely circumstantial evidence. Bșhaspati 549 also remarks that'a decision should not be arrived at merely by relying on the words of texts ; for, if judges come to a conclusion without applying careful reasoning, loss of dharma results; a thief is held to be not a thief and a good man is held to be a wicked one in a judical proceeding ( not arrived at with proper reasoning). The sage Māndavya was held to be a thief on account of the decision being arrived at without proper reasoning *550. 

The 9th Act of the Mṛcchakatika is a standing literary condemnation of conclusions about guilt drawn from circun stantial evidence and of how judicial procedure is vitiated (of vyavahāra-duṣtatā, as the author says in Act I). 

Nār. IV. 289 provides that when even circumstantial evi dence and presumptions therefrom do not enable the court to arrive at a decision, the judge should press the litigant with

kapathas (oaths and ordeals ) according to the place, time and strength of the litigant, such as fire, water, his spiritual merit and others. Manu VIII. 109 also says that when there are no witnesses the truth would have to be found out by sapathas. Divine proof is called daivikikriyā or samayakriya (Viṣnu Dh. 8. IX. 1). Some writers make a distinction between sapathas ( special oaths) and ordeals ( divyas ), others (like Manu VIII.. 109-114, Nār. IV. 239 ) do not. For example, the Vivādacandra quotes Nār. IV. 247 when there is no witness in a dispute between litigants, there the judge should decide by means of ordeals 551 and various sapathas'. Acc. to the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 96 ) and S. V. (p. 106 ) both special oaths and ordeals are divine proof ( divya pramūna), but in disputes of small value sapathas ( oaths) were generally employed, while ordeals were resorted to only in serious disputes or crimes. The Mit.(on Yāj. II. 96), the V. May. p. 46 and V. P. (p. 170) state that ordeals are those that generally end in immediate decision of the dispute, while sap ithas take time for decision ( because after the oath the king has to wait for a week or more to see whether a calamity befalls the person taking the special oath). Vyasa -quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 96 employs the word sapathas for both 

special oaths (taken as to one's 'satya') and ordeals like balance. Saṅkha-Likhita state that divine proofs are the balance, eating poison, entering fire, holding & piece of (hot) iron, offering one's merit acquired by sacrifices and charity and the king should make him undergo other sapathas 552 Bṛhaspati says that where documents or witnesses do not lead to a certain decision or wbere inference from circumstantial evidence also is confusing, there the matter is to be decided by divine proof 553. 

Special oaths were taken not only in judicial proceedings, but also in ordinary dealings to clinch one's assertion or to clear one's character or reputation. Nār. (IV. 243-244) refers to

the special oaths taken for clearing themselves by Vasistha when he was suspected to be a yātudhāna (a demon or sorcerer) and by the seven sages together with Indra, who (Bages) were suspected to have stolen lotus fibres (by each among them 554 ). Manu VIIL 110 also speaks of the sapatha taken by Vasiṣtha before Sudās, son of Pijavana ( when the sage was charged by Viśvāmitra with the offence of devouring his own hundred sons). Nārada (IV. 243) refers to Rg. VII. 104. 15-16 in the first of which Vasiṣtha made the imprecation, sss “May I die this very day if I am a yātudhūna or if I injured the life of a human being! May he who falsely addressed me as yātudhāna be deprived of his ten valiant sons'! Manu VIII. 110 also refers to the same hymn 555, Manu VIII. 113(=Nār. IV.199) referred to above (p. 343) states the various oaths to be taken or adıninistered to the parties according to their respective castes. Manu VIII. 114 further pro vides for special oaths for litigants by touching the heads of their sons and wives. That sapatha taken by satya was common in very ancient times appears from Pān. V. 4. 66 (satyād-aśapathe ).557 Nār. IV. 249 prescribes that in charges of grave offences ordeals may be resorted to and sapathas in matters of small moment. Nār. IV. 248 mentions' truth, horses and arms, kine, grains and gold, the feet of (the images of) gods and the ancestors, acts of charity and good deeds ( suksta) are to be employed in sapathas as declared by Manu.' Bṛhaspati 558 enumerates the special

Vide Best on ‘Evidence' (12th ed, of 1922 ) pp. 42-45 sections 56-59 for the employment of oaths in all ancient societies in courts 29 well as outside, for the foros and sanctions of oaths and for the arguments urged against their use,

oaths mentioned by Manu and Nār. and adds that they are to be employed in small matters ( civil and, criminal). The Viṣnu Dh. 8. (IX. 5-10) prescribes that when the litigant is a sūdra and the dispute relates to a matter worth less than one, two, three, four or five kronalas he should swear respectively by holding in his hand dūrvā grass, segame, silver, gold or earth taken from ploughed land, that (IX, 11-12 ) beyond that value various ordeals may be offered and that oaths with similar objects in the hands may be offered to vaisyas, ksatriyas and brāhmaṇas when the value of the subject matter is double, three times or four times of the value in the case of a sūdra. Manu VIII. 111 gives the admonition that a wise man should not make a false oath, because by so doing he incurs loss (of reputation) here and after death (by falling into Hell). Yāj. II. 236 prescribes a fine of 100 panas for one who takes an improper or profane oath 559 

The benefit of doubt is to be given, according to modern ideas on the administration of justice, to the accused. This principle was put forward several centuries before Christ by Ap. Dh, S. II. 5. 11.2 'the king should not punish when there is a doubt' (about a man's guilt 560 ).

## 14 Ordeals

CHAPTER XIV 

ORDEALS 

A brief history of ordeals may be get out here. Rg. I. 158. 4-5, wherein 561 the sage Dirghatamas, son of Ucatha, prays that the fire of faggots heaped tenfold may not burn him and that the rivers in which he was thrown bound hand and foot may not engulf him, are regarded by some as a reference to the ordeal of fire and water. Yet in those verses there is probably no reference to ordeals, but to the cruel treatment of Dirghatanas by dūsas headed by Traitana. Rg. III. 53. 22 also, where it 562 is said 'he beats the axe (or acc. to Sāyana 'just as the tree is injured by contact with the axe &c.')', does not contain a clear or certain reference to the ordeal of holding the heated axe. Atharvaveda 563 II. 12 is held by several Western scholars to contain a reference to the fire ordeal. This also is far from certain, though verse 8 may lend some support to that view $64. The Pancavimśa (or Tāndya ) Brāhmaṇa 14. 6. 6 refers 565 to the story of Vatsa, who was abused by his step-brother that the former was the son of a sūdra woman, against which Vatsa protested, urged that he was a brāhmaṇa, entered fire to prove the truth of his assertion and came out of fire unscathed. This is referred to by Manu VIII, 116. This is probably the earliest

and clearest reference in ancient Sanskrit Literature to the fire ordeal. Next comes the reference to holding in the hand the heated head of an axe by a person accused of theft to prove his innocence contained in the Chandogya 566 Upaniṣad VI. 16.1. Ap. Db. S. II. 11. 29. 6 refers to inference and divine proof (quoted above n. 542). In another place (II. 5. 11. 3) Apastamba states that after carefully considering ( the charge before him ) by means of divine proof and questioning ( of witnesses ) the king should get about awarding punishment. Saṅkha-Likhita (n. 552 ) name four ordeals, viz. those of balance, poison, water and holding red-hot iron 567. Manu VIII. 114 mentions only two viz. the holding of fire (i. e, red-hot iron) in the hand or plunging in water, but Nār. IV. 251 states that Manu declared five kinds of ordeals. Yāj. II. 95, Viṣnu Dh. S. IX-XIV and Nār. IV. 252 mention five viz. balance, fire, water, poison and kośa ( consecrated water ). Narada, however, knew two more viz. taptamāṣa (IV. 343) and tandula (IV. 337). Bphaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 315 Verses 4 and 5 ) and Pitāmaha speak of nine ( Apararka pp. 628, 694 respectively ).

Kāt. 411-461, Sukra IV. 5. 233,270 treat of the several ordeals Pitamaha contained, as the quotations from the digests show, the most elaborate treatment. That ordeals had attained great vogue in the early centuries of the Christian era is shown by the "Mṛcchakatika Act IX. 43 (where the ordeals of poison, water, balance and fire are expressly named) and by Bāṇa who mentions the same four in Kādambari, para 47 568 Among the digests and commentaries the Mitākṣarā, the Smṛticandrikā, the Divyatattva of Raghunandana, the Vyavahāramayukha and the Vyavahāraprakāśa contain the most elaborate treatment of ordeals 569

Use of ordeals 

363 

Divya is defined as that which decides a matter (in dispute) not determined by human means of proof '(V. Mayukha ) or 'that which decides what cannot be or is not to be decided by human means of proof' (Divyatattva 570 p. 574). Medhatithi on Manu VII. 116 discusses the question how ordeals can be relied upon for the discovery of truth. The objection is raised that fire and water are natural forces that act in a uniform way and are not intelligent beings which may change their minds by an appeal to them. Therefore, the objector says, ordeals and oaths are like magic and are only meant to frighten the parties into telling the truth. It is further objected that thieves may (by some trick) not be burnt in the fire ordeal and good men are seen to suffer. burns. The reply is: the usefulness of ordeals cannot be negatived by these examples of failures, as they are not frequent and as even direct perception and in ference sometimes lead to uncertain results. No one, however, says that these latter should not be relied upon. Just as one relies on witnesses in deciding a matter (who may for aught one knows be telling lies), 80 reliance can be placed on ordeals. Where there is failure in case of ordeals, it must be held to be due to the results of the performer's actions in past lives. The general rule as stated by Yāj. II. 2%, Nār. II. 29, IV. 239, Bphas pati 571, Kāt. ( 217 ) and Pitāmaha is that ordeals were to be resorted to only if no human evidence (witnesses, documents, possession) or circumstantial evidence was available. Kāt. (218-219) prescribes that 572 if one party relies on human means of proof and the other on divine proof, the king (or judge ) is to accept human means and not divine and that if human means of proof reach (i.e. are able to establish ) only a part of the allegations (in the plaint), then human means should be accepted and no divine modes of proof, even though they may be complete ( i.e. completely cover all allegations ). When Nār. II. 30 ( = IV. 241 ) states that divine' means of proof are to be resorted to when a transaction takes place in a forest, in

trial by ordesit is denied, or whomse, in cases of sūhasa 

a lonely place, at night, inside a house, in cages of sūhasa and when a deposit is denied, or when Kāt..(-230 ).prescribes that trial by ordeals is to be resorted to in the case of persons accus ed of committing sūhasa in secret (i.e. by wearing masks &c.), 573 those words only apply where it is impossible to have human evidence. Kāt. (229) states an exception to this viz. when the dispute 574 investigated is about sūhasa or about assault or abuse and defamation and in causes that spring from the use of force there is an option that witnesses or divina proof may be resorted to. Nār. IV. 242 states that divine proof could be resorted to when the chastity of women was in question, in theft and sāhasa and in all cases of the denial of monetary liability. Sita's ordeal of fire at once comes to mind as an illustration of Nārada's rule. Bphaspati 575 and Pitāmaha say that in disputes about immoveable property divine. proof should be avoided, which does not forbid divja altogether, but only where the evidence of neighbours or of a document is available and that in the latter case even if the defendant offers to pay a fine if he fails by the divine proof, ditya is not to be resorted to. The ordinary rule was that ordeals were to be administered to the defendant 576 (Kat. 411 =Viṣnu Dh. S. IX. 21 ). But Yaj. II. 96 gives an option that any one of the two litigants may by mutual agreement undergo an ordeal and the other should agree to pay on defeat a fine or undergo physical punishment. This means that buman proof is adduced to prove a positive proposition, that divine proof may be resorted to prove a negative proposition as well (e. g. a defendant denying the claim for a debt may prove by dirya that he did got borrow a loan). Making an offer to pay a fine or undergo corporal punishment is said to be being sirsakastha 577 or sirastha

Employment of the several ordeals 

365 

(in Yaj. 95, Viṣpu Dh. 8. IX. 20, 22, Pitāmaha, Nār. IV. 257, Kat. 412-413). Yaj. IL 95 prescribes that the ordeals of balance, fire, poison and water were to be prescribed in disputes of great value and not elsewhere and in II. 99. he says that all claims above 1000 panas ( of copper ) are to be regarded as of great value, but in charges of treason and of the commit. ting of any one of the five grave sing ( mahāpātakas ) any one of these four ordeals may be resorted to without regard to value and without any offer to pay fine on defeat. So also these four ordeals were to be offered to the defendant where the plaintiff offered to pay a fine on defeat. The ordeal of kosa was allowed in all claims whether of high value or low valne or whether the plaintiff offered to pay a fine on defeat or not. 

Yaj. II. 98 states that the ordeal of balance should be given to women, a minor (under 16 ), a very old person (above eighty years), the blind, the cripple, brāhmaṇas and the diseased; the fire ordeal (i. e. heated ploughshare and heated māṣa) to kṣatriyas, water ordeal to vaiśyas, poison to sūdras. Nār. IV. 335 assigns ordeals to the different varnas similarly. Nār. IV. 256 presoribes that ordeals should not be undergone by those who are observing a vow, who are much distressed or who are performing austerities, and by women. Pitāmaha quoted by Mit. (on Yāj. II. 98) adds minors and old persons to these. The Sm. O. II. p. 103 explains this ag referring to the ordeals of fire, poison and water only. Another Smrti (q. by Mit. on Yāj. II. 98) prescribes that the ordeals of balance and kośamay be offered to women, minors and the others mentioned above. There is in all these rules a spirit of tolerance, kindness and concern for the weaknesses of mankind. Kāt. (423) holds 578 that persons of the higher castes who are cowherds, traders, artisans, bards, domestic servants and usurers should be given ordeals as if they were sūdras. Kāt. (422) allows all ordeals to members of all castes, except that brāhmapas are not to undergo the poison ordeal Kāt. (424-426) prescribes that the ordeal of fire should not be offered to blacksmiths or those who are leprous nor of water to those who ply boats or who suffer from diffi. culty in breathing or cough, nor poison to those who are experts in incantations and yogic practices or who suffer from (excess

of) bile or phlegm, nor kosa to those who are drunkards, to persons fond of women, to gamblers and to those who are atheists. Viṣnu Dh. 8. IX. 25, 29 and Nār. IV. 255, 332 contain similar provisions. Kāt. (427-430) further provides that no ordeal should be allowed to be performed personally by the following persons, viz. those charged with the murder of their father, mother, a brāhmaṇa, their teacher, a minor, a woman and the king; those guilty of the (five) grave sins; particularly those that are atheists; those who wear (or subsist by ) peculiar sect marks; great rogues; those who are experts in incantations and yoga practices; those who are the progeny of unions of persons of different varnas; those who repeatedly engage in sin; in the case of these the king should offer ordeals to good men appointed by them on their behalf and if such good men are not willing then they should appoint their own relatives. Saṅkha-Likhita also refer to the appointment of friends or relatives as representatives (Aparārka p. 842) 579. Kāt (433) 580 lays down the following rather remarkable pro Vision, viz. when untouchables, men of lowest castes, slaves, mlecchas and those born of mixed unions in the reverse order of the castes are guilty of crimes, the determination of their guilt (by the above mentioned ordeals) should not be made by the king; he should indicate such ordeals as are in vogue among them.

only when they cannot secure relatives or other persons appointed by them to undergo the usual ordeals on their behalf. The Vyavahāratattva (p. 579) explains that the ordeals referred to among mlecchas and others are the snake in the jar and the like. This seems to have consisted in taking out a ring or coin with the hand from a jar in which a snake was placed; if there was no snake bite or no effect even if the snake bit, the person was declared innocent. Vide note 580. Yāj. II. 97 and Nār. IV. 268, 320 prescribe that all ordeals are to be administered by the chief justice in the morning at sunrise or in the forenoon in the presence of the king, the sabhyas and brāhmaṇas. The Mit. adds that a Sunday is the proper day according to the usage of respectable people ( śiṣtas). Pitamaha specially provides that the water ordeal should be administered in the noon and poison in the last watch of the night (Mit. on Yāj. II. 97). Certain seasons and months were either appro priate or inappropriate to certain ordeals e. g. Nār. IV. 254 states that the fire ordeal should be given in the rainy season, balance in the winter ( sisira), water in summer, poison when the season is cool. Nār. IV. 259 prohibits water ordeal in the cold season, fire in summer, poison in the rainy season and balance while the wind blows violently. The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 97) and Par. M. III. 162 quote Pitāmaha to the effeot that the months of Caitra, Vaisakha and Mārgasirsa are common to all ordeals, kośa and balance may be administered in all months. 

As regards the place, Pitamaha prescribes that ordeals are to be administered by the king or the judge appointed by the king in the presence of learned brāhmaṇas and the public (or the ministers ) 581 Kat. ( 434-35 and 437 ) provides : 582 ordeals should be administered in some well-known temple in the cage of men accused of grave sins and near the royal gate in the case

of those charged with treason; in a public place where four roads meet in the case of those bora of mixed unions in the revarse order of castes, in oases other than these in the hall of justice. When ordeals are administered in an improper place or at an improper time and when they are performed outside human habitation (in a lonely place ) they fail as to the matter in hand ( i, e. they cease to be decisive ). Nār. IV. 265 prescribes that the balance should be planted in the hall of justice or at the royal gate or near a temple or where four roads meet. 

The procedure common to all ordeals and described in the Mit. on Yāj. II. 97 and 99, the V. May. pp. 52-55, V.P. pp. 183-186 (all relying on Pitāmaha ) and Vyavahāra-nirnaya pp. 148-53 (relying on Prajāpati, Pitamaha, Br.) is briefly as follows In ordeals the chief justice is to do every thing at the king's bidding as the adhuuryu priest does in all sacrifices. He should observe a fast and the sodhya (person undergoing the ordeal to clear himself) is also to do the same. Both are to bathe in the morning and the sodhya was to have his wet clothes on. The Chief Judge is to invoke the gods to the accompaniment of music and to offer flowers, sandal-wood paste and incense. He should fold his hands, face the east and invoke Dharma to be present at the ordeal (Dharma being the principal deity in ordeals ) and assign places to Indra, Yama, Varuna and Kubera in the four principal quarters from the east and to Agni and other guardians of quarters in the corners of the principal quarters. He is to contemplate on the eight deities of the eight quarters as having different colours (viz. Indra as yellow, Yama as dark &c.). He is to assign the eight Vasus (repeat ing their names) to the south of Indra, the twelve Adityas (repeating their names) between Indra and Iśāna (i. e, between east and north-east), assign a place to the eleven Rudras to the west of Agni, assign a place to the seven Mother goddesses between Yama and Nirsti ( between south and south west), assign a place to Ganesa to the north of Nirsti, to the Maruts ( seven) to the north of Varuṇa; to the north of the balance (or the place of other ordeals) he should invoke Durga. All these deities are to be invoked with appropriate Vedio mantras (set out in. V. May.). . He should offer the geveral:items of worship from arghya ( water offered by way of honour) to ornament to Dharma (as the principal deity) and then to the subsidiary deities from Indra to Durga (according to appropriateness ) and then sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, lamp and naivedya to the deities from Dharma to Durga. The

flowers for Dharma are to be red. Up to this is the work of the Chief Justice. Sacrificial priests should offer into fire in the four quarters 108 oblations of clarified butter, boiled rice and fuel sticks with syllable Om and the Gayatri and with 'Om' and 'svāha' at the end of each. Having written down on a leaf the subject matter for which the party is undergoing ordeal the leaf should be placed on the head of the sodhya with the mantra, 583 'the sun, the moon, the wind, fire, heaven and earth, waters, the heart, Yama, day and night, the two twi. lights and Dharma know ( see or mark) the deeds of men'. 

The several ordeals will now be briefly described. 

First comes tula or dhata (balance). A sacrificial tree (such as khadira or udumbara ) should be cut to the accompani ment of vedic mantras ( employed in making a sacrificial post). Two wooden posts made of that tree should support a trans Verse beam (called akṣa ). The posts should be fixed in the ground, the part above ground being four cubits and that below being two cubits. This frame should face the east (i. e. the posts must be in the south and north). Then the beam of the balance was to be made from the same tree and was to be suspended from the transverse beam of the frame by means of a hook. Three iron rings were to be fastened to the beam of the balance, two at the end and one in the middle for suspending the balance from the transverse beam by means of a chain or string. Two scales were to be suspended at the two ends of the beam by hooks and strings from the iron rings fixed at the ends of the beam. On the two sides of the balance there should be two arohes in which the scales should move and whioh should be ten angulas higher than the balance. There should be two perpendicular pendants made of clay hanging down from the arches and touching the upper surface of the balance In the pan to the west the sodhya should be placed and weighed against clay, bricks and stones placed in the other pan. Then traders or goldsmiths or braziers should examine the balance and bring it ott a level with the two pendants hanging down from the arches and examine the perfect horizontality of the

beam of the balance by spilling a little water on the beam. When the person sitting in one pan is equal in weight to the materials ( olay &o.) in the other, a line should be drawn with chalk by the experts on the arch ( to show the exact position of the pans). Then the man is made to get down from the pan and he is to invoke the balance as stated in Yaj. II. 101-102, 

O balance, you are the abode of truth, you were created by the gods for this purpose, declare the truth, free me from this (cloud of) suspicion, Mother! if I am a sinner then take me lower, if I am pure take me upwards'. The person is then to hear exhortations about the result of untruth after putting the writing on his head (vide Nār. IV. 276 and Visnu Dh, S. X. 9), then he is again to be placed in the pan to the accompaniment of invocations (Nār. IV. 278–279, Viṣṇu Dh. S. X. 10-11). A worthy brahmana learned in astronomy is to calculate the time of five palas 584 or vinā līs. Then his weight is again to be marked. If the person goes up (i. e. is found lighter than what he formerly weighed) he is declared innocent (acc. to the com. on Nār. IV. 283, V. Mayūkha p. 60, Dipakalikā on Yāj. II. 102); if he weighs the same or goes down (i. e. weighs more) he is guilty. Then the person concerned is to distribute gifts to the judge, the brāhmaṇas and sacrificial priests and take leave of the deities invoked. Bșhaspati (SBE vol. 33 p. 317 v. 19) states that he who weighs the same should be weighed once more. If the pan or the beam or the hooks break or the ropes give way owing to some visible cause then the procedure was to be repeated, but if the breaking is due to an unseen cause or accident, the person was to be declared guilty. . The ordeal of fire is as follows --Nine circles with cowdung are to be drawn from west to east, they being meant for Agni, Varupa, Vāyu, Yama, Indra, Kubera, Soma, Savitr and all gods. Each circle was to be 16 angulas in diameter and the space between two circles was to be 16 angulas. In each circle kusa grass was to be spread and the person to be tested was to plant his feet on them ; ghee was to be offered into fire 108 times. A blacksmith by birth should heat in fire a ball of iron weighing 50 palas (16 palas 585 in the case of a weak man) and eight

A pala weighed 320 gufljās according to the Liāvati (1. 4). Acc. to Divyatattva (p. 608) 20 palas were equal to 66 tolakas, five māṣas and 4 guðjās, which, while accepting the view that a pala is equal to 320 guðjās, gives the rather modern measurement into tolākas (tolas).

angulas in length till it becomes red-hot and emits sparks. Then all the details described above ending with the placing of the writing on the head of the śodhya are to be gone through by the judge and the fire (in the red-hot piece ) is to be invoked with several mantras (such as Yaj. II. 104586 and Visṇu Dh. S. XI. 11-12). The sodhja should stand in the first circle facing the east. Having niade red marks on all sores of the hands of the sodhya on which grains of rice have been rubbed, he (the judge ) should place seven leaves of the asvattha tree on them and also grains of rice and curds and should fasten round them threads. Then the judge should carry the red-hot iron piece by means of a pair of tongs and place it in the hands of the sodhya (that are covered with leaves). Then the sodhya holding in both his hands the red-hot piece should walk from the first to the eighth circle not hurriedly but slowly and at ease. Having reached the 8th 597 circle he should throw the red-hot iron piece on to the 9th circle. Then the judge should rub on the hands of the sodhya rice grains and wben the latter shows no hesitation at the rubbing and no injury on his hand at the end of the day he is declared to be innocent. Kat. ( 441 ) and Yāj. II. 107 provide that if the red-hot piece falls earlier (i. e. before reach ing the 8th circle) or there is a doubt ( whether his hands are injured or not) or if he loses his footing or is burnt elsewhere than on the hands he should again undergo the ordeal. 

The ordeal of water as described in the smrtis and digests is rather complicated. The Sm, C. ( II. p. 116 ) remarks that 588 as the ordeals of water and poison had gone out of yogue (in its day ) it passes over the procedure of these and takes up the description of kośa ordeal after the fire ordeal. Having gone to a reservoir of water the judge should get erected on its bank a torana ( an arch) as high as the ear of the sodhya on an even and cowdunged plot. He should offer worship to Varupa (Lord of waters), to a bow of middling size and to three arrows ( the points of which are made not of iron but of bamboo) with sandal

A post of some macred tree is to be fixed in the water and a strong man of one of the three higher castes free from love or hatred for the Śodhya is to stand in navel-deep water facing the east and holding the post. Then the judge is to make the sodhya stand in water, invoke the deities from Dharma to Durgā, perform all the rites up to the placing of the writing ( embodying the accusation) on the head of the sodhya. A kṣatriya or a brāhmaṇa following the profession of arms who is of a pure heart and has observed a fast should discharge, while standing near the root of the torana, three arrows at the target. The sodhya should invoke the water with the mantra, 'O Varupa I save me by means of truth' ( Yaj. II. 108 ) 589 Then a young but swift man should run to the spot where the second arrow struck the ground, and stand there holding that arrow in his hand. Another swift man stands at the root of the torana whence the arrows were discharged. Then the judge claps his hands thrice. At the third clap the sodhya dives into the water seizing the thighs of the man standing in water and at the same time the swift man near the arch runs at his best speed to the place where the second arrow fell. The other man who holds the arrow starts off the moment the first runner reaches him and comes running to the arch. If he does not see the sodhya or sees only his head (i.e. the back of the head ) when he reaches the arch the sodhya is to be declared innocent ; but if he sees other parts of the head ( such as the ear or nose &c.) or if the sodhya floats to some part other than the ono where he dived he is not innocent.

gods and brāhmaṇas. The poison to be selected is tārniga (derived from the spāga plant) or vatsanābha (aconite ) or haimavata (Visnu Dh. S. XIII.3, Nār. IV.322 &c.). Pitāmaha (g. by Aparārka p. 712) treats the three as distinct, while Yāj. II. 111 appears to prescribe śārnga growing on the Himalaya as the poison to be selected. Viśṇu Dh. 8. (XIII, 2-3) also does the same. In the rains the quantity of poison is to be six yavas in weight, in summer five, in hemanta (and sisira) geven or eight and in sarad (autumn) less than the latter (i. e, six yavas acc. to Mit. and three acc. to V. Mayūkha). Poison is to be administered in the last watch of the night and never in the noon or after noon or twilight; it was to be mixed with ghee thirty times as much. It may be administered to any one except a brāh maṇa. Viṇpu Dh. S. XIII. 6-7 and Nār. IV. 325 are mantras with which the judge invokes poison and Yaj. II. 110 is the mantra which the sodhya repeats before taking poison viz. 'O poisonl thou art the son of Brahma, thou art firm in the duty of ( deciding) the truth. Save me from this accusation and be like nectar to me by truth (if I be innocent)'. Nār. IV. 326 states that then the sodhya should eat the poison, should be kept in shade without food and guarded the rest of the day and if he discloses no signs of the effect of poison should be declared innocent. If the dose of poison is large, the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 111) says that when the sodhya shows no change till five hundred clappings of hands then he should be declared to be innocent and medical treatment should be resorted to. Pita maha says that, in order to prevent fraud, for three or five nights before the ordeal the intending sodhya should be kept under the supervision of the king's servants and an examination should be made whether medicines, incantations or precious stones that are antidotes are secretly employed. 

The ordeal of kosa. The godhya is made to worship the stern deities (such as Rudra, Durgā, Aditya) with sandal wood paste, flowers ato, and made to bathe the images with water. Then the judge asks the sodhya to invoke the consecrated water with the mantrā* satyena mābhirakṣı' (Yaj. II. 108) and makes him drink three handfuls (prasști ) of that water. Pitamaha gives some special rules. The water may be that of the bath of the image of that god of which the sodhya is a devotee or if he holds all images in equal esteem, then of the Sun. In the case of Durga it is her spike (śūla) that is to be bathed, the orb in the case of the Sun and the weapons in the case of other 

314 

History of Dharmasastra 

[ Vol. 

gods. The water of the bath of Durga is to be offered as ordeal to thieves and those who live by the profession of arms and the water of the bath of the Sun is not to be given to brāhmanas. In other divyas the result is declared immediately, but in the kośa ordeal there is a period of waiting which is more or less according to the value of the claim or the gravity of the offence. Acc. to Yaj. II. 113, Visnu Dh. S. 14. 4-5, Nār. IV. 330, if within fourteen days of taking the kośa ordeal the sodhya does not Buffer any serious calamity due to the king's action or the act of God or does not fall seriously ill or does not lose by death his son or wife or other dear relative or his wealth, then he is to be declared innocent. Insignificant loss or illness did not matter as it is unavoidable in this world. Besides, the calamity or illness must not be one common to several people (such as an epidemic). Drinking holy water ( kośapāna) was employed not only as an ordeal for proving innocence, but it was resorted to also for assuring another about one's good will and future honesty (vide Rājat. V. 326 ). 

Ordeal of Tandula ( rice grains ). It is to be administered in charges of theft or disputes about debts or other monetary matters. On the preceding day grains of rice should be made white (i.e. husked ). The judge should perform all the rites on the previous day. The rice grains should be placed in an earthen vessel, exposed to the sun, water of the bath of (the image of the sun should be poured over them in the vessel and the vessel should be kept in that state the whole night. The next day in the morning the sodhya should swallow thrico the rice grains. He should be made to spit on a pippala or birch leaf. If blood is found mixed in his saliva he should be declared guilty. . 

Ordeal of taptamāṣa ( heated piece of gold). In a vessel of copper, iron or clay sixteen angulas in diameter and four angulas deep, the judge should get twenty palas of ghee and oil poured and heat it to the boiling point. Then the judge should cast into it a golden piece weighing one māṣaka ( equal to five gunjūs ). The sodhya should take out the heated golden piece with the thumb and the next two fingers. If he does not jerk his fingers or there is no scalded skin he should be declared to be innocent. Thera is another method. Cow's ghee should be poured in a vessel of gold, silver, copper, iron or olay and it should be beated to the boiling point so that when a green leaf is cast into it the sound churu' is produced. Into the 

HI

boiling ghee he should cast a golden, silver, copper or iron seal ring once washed. Then he should invoke the ghee with this mantra 'O gheel thou art the holiest thing in sacrifices, thou art nectar; burn him (the sodhya) if he is a sinner ; be cool as ice if he be innocent.' Then the sodhya takes out the ring from the boiling ghee. If there are no marks of scalding on his forofinger he is innocent. 

Ordeal by phāla (ploughshare). This is described by Bphaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 318 verse 28) quoted by the Sm. C. II. p.119, V.P. p. 218 and others. A ploughshare of iron weighing twelve palas, eight angulas long and four broad should be made red-hot and the thief should be made to lick it once with big tongue. If he is not burnt he establishes his innocence; if otherwise, he is guilty. The Vyavahāratattva (p. 608 ) mentions that acc. to Maithila writers the thief meant is a cattle-lifter. The ordeal mentioned in the Chāndogya Upaniṣad is a phala divja. 

Ordeal of dharma (i. e. of the images or pictures of Dharma). Men guilty of causing bodily injuries or who have monetary disputes or who desire to undergo this ordeal ag an expiation for sins should undergo this. A silver image of Dharma and a leaden or iron one of Adharma should be prepared or the judge should draw on a birch leaf or a piece of cloth figures or pictures of Dharma and Adharma respectively white and dark in colour. Having sprinkled pañcayavya over the two, he should worship them with white and dark flowers respectively. The images or figures should then be placed in two balls of clay or cowdung. The two balls should be then placed inside a new earthen vessel in a cowdunged spot in the presence of images of gods and in the presence of brāhmaṇas. Then the judge should perform all the rites from the invocation of Dharma to the placing of the writing on the head. The sodhya should repeat the words 

if I am free from guilt may (the image or picture of) Dharma come to my hands'. Saying this he should take out one ball from the vessel.,. If he takes out Dharma he is innocent. This resembles the dfawing of lots. 

Ordeals played their part in the judicial systems of most ancient countries. In early England handling of red-hot iron and plunging the hand in boiling water were the commonest ordeals. In the ordeal of water sinking was a sign of innocence and floating of guilt. Stephens ( History of Criminal Law of England, vol. I p. 73) suggests that the ordeal of water 

376 

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. 

was a form of honourable suicide. The Assize of Northampton (1116 A. D.) prescribed the ordeal of water for murder, robbery, theft, forgery and arson, but ordeals were abolished in England from 1215 A. D. (ibid. vol. I. p. 300). In India 591 there is epigra phic and other evidence to show that ordeals were resorted to till the end of the 18th century and rarely even later. In the Kittur Pillar Inscription (J, B. B. R. A. S. vol. IX. pp. 307-309) dated in Kaliyuga era 4289 in the reign of Kadamba king Jayakesideva there is a description of the phāladivya which was administered by mutual agreement on Sunday to an acārya Sivasakti who had a dispute about a plot of land with Kalyāṇa sakti the ācārya of another shrine and whose hand was exami ned the next day after he underwent the ordeal by all the bankers of the agrahāra village Degāve. In the Silimpur stone slab Inscription of the time of Jayapāladeva (E. I. vol. XIII. p. 283 at p. 291-292) there is a reference to the ordeal of 

591. In Beal's 'Buddbist Records of the Western world,' vol. I. p. 84 (also Watters on Yuan Chwang's travels vol. I. p. 172) four kinds of ordeals are mentioned as in vogue, viz. by water, fire, weigbt and poison. In the water ordeal the accused is placed in a sack connected with a stone vessel and thrown into deep water. If the man sinks and the stone floats he is guilty: if the man floats and the stone sioks then he is pronounced fagocent. The ordeal by fire is: they beat a plate of iron and make the accused sit on it and again place his feet on it and apply it to the palms of bis bands: moreover he is made to pass bis tongue over it. If no scar results he is innocent; if there are scars his guilt is proved. In the ordeal by weight a man and a stone are placed evenly in a balance. If the accused is innocent the stone rises in the balance; if he is guilty the man rises and the stone falls. In the ordeal of poison an incision is made in the right thigh of a ram, all sorts of poison with a portion of the food of the accused are placed in the incised wound. If the man is guilty poison takes effect and the animal dies; if he is innocent the poison has no effect and the animal survives. It will be noticed that these descriptions of the four ordeals do not agree in several respects with the descriptions in the smrtis and digests, while the poison ordeal in Beal has nothing in common with the smrti poison ordeal. Alberudi (tr, by Sachau, vol. II, pp. 159-160) probably speaks of poison ordeal in the words * the accused person is invited to drink dish called brahmana' (ho is probably referring to poison being called the offspring of Brahmā in Yāj. II. 110 and Nār. IV. 325). In the ordeal of water the accused is simply thrown into a deep and rapidly flowing river or a deep well and he was held innocent if he was not drowned. He describes the kośa ordeal and balance ordeal accurately, but states that if the man has spoken the truth be weighs more than before. He describes correctly taptamaṣa (gold piece taken from boiling clarified butter) and also the ordeal of the red-hot iron piece

balance 59 (about 1200 A. D.). The Viṣnukundin king Madhava varman in the 7th century A. D. (Journal of Andhra Historical Research Society, vol. VI pp. 17, 20, 24) is said to have carried out various ordeals (avasita-vividha-divijah). The E. C. vol. III (Mandyā Taluka Ing. No.79 p. 47) records that a dispute having arisen about the boundaries of land bestowed by means of a copperplate grant by the Hoysala king Vira-Narasimhadeva, one Kannaya, a descendant of the original donee, performed an ordeal by holding consecrated food in the presence of the God Hoysaleśvara in the capital Dorasamudra and came out suc cessful. E. C. IV. p. 27 ( Yelandur Jagir Ing. No. 2 page 27, about 1580 A, D.) is a charter to potters whose headmen under went the ordeal of dipping their hands in boiling ghee as against barbers and washermen who denied that potters could pare their toe nails and tie on upper cloth (at the time of marriage). In the Indian Antiquary for 1931 (vol. 60 p. 179) an extract is cited from the Archæological Report for Travancore 1930 which describes the balance ordeal undergone by a brāhmaṇa 18 years before and seen by the writer himself in the temple of Siya at Calicut. For the ordeal of red-hot ploughshare in the case of thefts, vide Report of South Indian Epigraphy for 1907, para. 27. 

In the times of the Maratha kings ordeals were resorted to. For example, in 'Peshwa's Diaries' vol. 2 p. 150 (in 1764-65 A, D.) mention is made of taptakaļāha ordeal (i. e. taking out a coin or ring or a piece of metal from a large vessel in which either water or oil or ghee had been brought to the boiling point) in which the person undergoing it had his right hand burnt up to the middle joints of the fingers and was declared to be false. In a Marathi publication called 'Vatanpatrem, nivādapatrem &c.' pp. 46-56 edited by P. V. Mavjee and D. B. Parasnis (1909) there is a document which describes in great detail the ordeal of fire undergone in connection with a dispute about the office and emoluments of Deshpande in the district of Kalyan in sake 1666 Pausa bright 11th, Thursday (1745 A. D.). It is stated therein that the ordeal was performed on the tank of the sacred river Godavari at Kopargaon in accordance with Dharmaśāstra in the presence of the Peshwa himself and learned brāhmaṇas and panditas near the temple of the god Sri Suklesvara, that as the opponent was long in

possession the ordeal had to be performed by the man claiming title, that an iron ball of 50 palas (i. e. 166 tolas and two māsas) was heated red-hot and the sodhya carried it across seven circles and threw it in the 8th circle on flour and bundles which began to burn, that his hands were examined in the presence of the opponent and the respectable people and were found unaffected and the opponent was made to pass a docu. ment of victory to the sodhya called 'yejitapatra'. The des cription agrees very closely with that given above. In the same work at pp. 36-41 there is a remarkable description about an ordeal undergone (in 1742 A. D.) by Mahomedan litigants in their own mosque for 15 days by lighting lamps and sitting down in the shrine. There are several other vatanpatras in the same work which refer to ordeals. 

For an informing article on divyas reference may be made to Dr. Dines Chandra Sirkar's "The successors 593 of the Sata vahanas' Appendix pp. 354-376 (Calcutta, 1939). He quotes therein a passage from the 'Asiatic Researches' vol. 1, from which it appears that a magistrate named Ali Ibrahim Khan at Benares tried by phala divya two cases in 1783 A. D. and reported them to the then Governor-General, Warren Hastings. In the * Txtiya-Bammelana-vrtta' (pp. 18-26) and in the Caturtha sammelana-vrtta pp. 100-154 of the Bhārata-itihāsa-samsodhaka mapdala at Poona (both in Marathi) Mr. Bhaskar Vaman Bhat contributes two thoughtful and scholary papers on the adminis tration of Justice in the times of the Marathas in which the part played by ordeals is described at some length. 

593. It is somewhat strange that Dr. Sirkar refers to ‘Divyatattva of Bphaspati' (in Successors of the Sātavābanas' Appendix p. 360). A Divya tattva of Raghunandana is well-known. A Divyatattva of Brbaspati has so far baca mcationed powhere.

CHAPTER XV 

DECISION 

The last (i. e. 4th) stage in a judicial proceeding is siddhi (Yaj. II. 8) or nirnaya ( decision). If pratyākalita (as defined above on p. 298) is regarded as a pāda of vyavahāra (and since all are agreed that there are only four pādas) then the decision is not a pūda of a lawsuit but is the fruit thereof (V. P. p. 86). When the evidence has been led, the king (or chief justice ) should with the help of the sabhyas decide upon the success or failure of the plaintiff594, Nar. II. 42 says that the sabhyas should ask the parties to leave the court when they are considering their verdict or what decision was to be pronounced 5%. It is stated by Vyāsa and Sukra IV. 5. 271 that the decision of a case is based on eight sourceg 596 ( 6 acc. to Sukra) viz. the three pramāṇas (possession, documents and witnesses ), logical inference, the usages of the country, sapathas (oaths and ordeals), the king's edict and the admission of the litigants. Pitāmaka prescribes that, in disputes where there are no witnesses, no possession nor documents and no recourse can be had to divine proof, there the king is the final deciding factor as he is the lord of all 597 

It is stated by Nārada II. 41 and 43 that, whether a party is defeated by his own admission or by his own conduct ( i. e. because he adduces false witnesses or forged documents) or

whether he is defeated after full trial and the adducing of proof, it is proper that the defeat should be declared by the sabhyas ( the judges) and that a Jayapatra (a document of success i.e. a judgment) should be given to the successful party couched in fitting terms. Several verses of Narada (quoted by Aparārka p.684), Brhaspati (S.B.E. vol. 33 p. 307 verse 19), Kat. (259-265), Vrddha-Vasistha (q. by Mit. on Yaj. II. 91 and Apararka. p. 684) and Vyasa. (Sm. C. II. p. 57 ) lay down the contents of the judgment 598. It was to contain a brief statement of the plaint, the reply, the evidence, the depositions of witnesses, discussion thereof, arguments, the smrti texts applicable, the opinion of the sabhyas, the decision and the relief granted, and should be signed by the chief justice and bear the royal seal. Vas. 19. 10 refers to precedents also in the decision of cases and the award ing of punishments (agamad-drstāntac-ca ). The Mit. quotes a smrti text (on Yaj. II. 91) that other members of the assembly ( who are not judges ) proficient in smrti may also sign the judgment to show that the decision is acceptable to them also, But this was not absolutely necessary, as is made clear by the Vivādacandra p. 146. Kāt. ( 256 ) applies the word pascātkāra 599 ( refutation) to a judgment containing the above particulars given after a complete contest, while he restricts the word jayapatra to a document (given by the judge ) when a plaintiff becomes what is called hinavādi (because he makes a change in his pleading or for similar cause ) and when there has been no complete trial of an action; and such a document embodies only what happened. Kaut. (III. 19) appears to employ the word 'pascatkara' in a somewhat different sense when he says 'the

person, who, when charged with murder, does not reply to the charge that very day, stands refuted' (i. e, is found guilty ) 600 The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 91 ) differing from Kat holds a jayapatra to be a judgment giving a summary of the plaint, the reply, the evidence and the decision, while when a plaintiff is defea ted for change of pleading or for default of appearance or for non-prosecution the document stating this is called 'hinapatraka'. It is to be regretted that ancient jayapatras in Sanskrit have not yet been discovered. In 25 Calcutta Weekly Notes pp. CXLII-III Dr. Jolly communicated the substance of a jayapatra, couched in ancient Javanese, engraved on a copper plate found in the island of Java and described by Dr. Brandes in a Dutch paper. That judgment is dated sake 849 (928 A.D.), relates to a dispute about a debt of one suvarna in which the plaintiff failed because he did not appear at the trial. At the end there are the signatures of four witnesses and the document is styled jayapatra at the end. Vide for the same jayapatra J. B. O, R. S. vol. VII pp. 117 ff. The late Mr. K. P. Jayaswal published in 24 Calcutta Weekly Notes (pp. CXLIX-CLVI) a jayapatra (text, translation and remarks) granted by the Hindu court of Mithilā in sake 1716 (1794 A, D.) and in J. B. O, R. S. vol. VI pp. 246-258, which strictly conforms to the rules of procedure laid down in the smrtis and nibandhas and is couched in dignified, technical and scrupulously formal language. It related to the ownership of a slave girl. Plaintiff at first made default in appearance; the judgment notes this and also refers to the restoration of the suit. The defendant raised an objection that a single witness to prove a matter was inadmissible. This objection was upheld. Then plaintiff prayed that he might be allowed to undergo an ordeal, but this request was disallowed as human proof was possible and plaintiff ultimately lost his suit. The judgment is written and signed by one Sacala miśra, who was the chief justice, and is addressed to other members of the sabhā, called dharmādhyakṣas and panditas, seven of whom express their concurrence (sammati) at the top of the document. Vide Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society vol. XXVIII for 1942 for nine Sanskrit jayapatras from the courts of Mithilā in the 18th and 19th centuries. 

The Mit. (on Yāj II. 91), and V. Mātrkā , p. 309 note that a jayapatra is given specially to prevent the same matter being

agitated again, while a document given where a party is hinavadi (i, e. a Ninapatraka) serves the purpose of making that party liable later on to pay a fine. When a dispute was decided by a domestic tribunal (kula &c.) there was no jayapatra but only & nirnaya-patra ( kuladibhir nirguye jayapatrabhāvān-nirnaya ptram tatra kāryam parattapatramiti yāvat, as the Vy. Nirnaya p. 85 says). It would be better to adopt the reading 'vrttapatram' as given by one Ms. 

The defeated party has to pay a fine to the king and the successful party was complimented (or honoured) by the king (or chief justice) and was to be put in possession of the matter that he succeeded in proving 601 Manu VIII. 51 prescribes that in monetary matters (i. e, in civil disputes) the defeated party should be made by the king to pay the judgment debt to the successful party and also some fine to the king according to his ability, while Manu VIII. 139 lays down that when the defendant admits in the court his liability he has to pay to the king five per cent as fine and if the defendant denied his liabi lity altogether and was proved to be false he had to pay as fine double of that (i. e. ten per cent). This is analogous to court fee, for which see above pp. 294–295. If one or both parties had laid down a stake or wager (viz. 'if I be defeated in this Bult I shall pay a hundred paṇas') then he had to pay that stake to the king and a fine as above and the subject of dispute to the successful party (Yāj. II. 18 and Nār.

Meaning of Tirita and Anusista 

383 

anusista' have been variously explained 603. The word 'tirita' is very ancient and occurs in the Delhi Pillar Edict IV of Asoka (E. I. Vol. II. p. 253 ) as 'tilita-dandānam' qualifying men imprisoned in jails. Medhātithi and Kullūka explain them as 

decided according to the rules of the śāstra' and 'taken so far as to recover fine from the unsuccessful party' respectively. Kāt. (495) defines them differently: "When a certain side is decided by the sabhyas themselves (without the examination of witnesses ) to be either true or false, it is said to be tirita and that matter or side is called 'anusista' which is declared (to be true or false) on the testimony of witnesses." The lexcion called Vaijayanti seems to have Kāt. in mind and defines 'tirita' as a perverse decision given by the sabhyas themselves and 'anusista 'occurs where the evidence of witnesses makes what is true appear as false ( Bhūmikānda, vaiśyādhyāya, verses 11-12). Nār. II. 65 (S. B. E, vot 33 p. 22 ) employs the two words, which the Mit. on Yaj. II. 306 respectively explains as (tirita) ' decided by reliance on documents and witnesses but not carried so far as to recover a fine', and (*anuśiṣta') as decided so far as to recover a fine from the defeated party'. Vide Apararka p. 866 and V. P. p. 90 for explanations. 

According to Kāt. quoted in the Vyavahārasāra (p. 101 ) 604 the decree should provide for the successful party receiving the interest on or accretions to the movable or immovable pro perty placed (during the pendency of the suit) in the hands of a third party (as a sort of Receiver). Kāt, (477-480) points 605 out the various ways in which a decree may be executed. The king should make a brāhmaṇa debtor return the decretal debt

to the judgment creditor by conciliatory words, should make other debtors return it according to the usage of the country and compel bad people to satisfy the decree by means of phy sical pain (i. e. imprisonment). The king should make a co sharer or friend (of the successful party ) pay the deoretal debt by means of a ruse (i. e. by borrowing an ornament or the like from him on a festive occasion and handing it over to the creditor) and also make traders, husbandmen and artisans (to pay) in a similar way. On finding that the debtor is un able to return the debt in cash, the king should make the debtor, whether a ksatriya, vaisya, sūdra or husbandman, work (for the creditor). If he be unable to work the debtor should be sent to jail except when he is a brāhmaṇa. Manu also (IX. 229) says that if the members of the three varnas other than brāli maṇa are unable to pay the fine imposed by the king they should be made to work for the king, but a brahmana may be allowed to pay in easy and small instalments. If a brāhmaṇa debtor was unable to pay, nothing could be done for recovery of the decretal debt except taking a surety from him if any one cared to be one. In modern times also judgment debtors are liable to be arrested and detained in civil jail in execution of decrees under rules 55-58 of the Indian Civil Procedure code (except women in execution of a decree for the payment of money). If in ancient times state policy exempted brāhmaṇas from arrest and detention in a civil jail for monetary debts on spiritual grounds and on the ground of caste, in modern times the State in Indra exempts agriculturists from arrest ar imprisonment in execution of a decree for money on economic grounds under certain legislative enactments like sec. 21 of the Deccan Agri culturists Relief Act (Bombay Act XVII of 1879). As regards women also Kat. ( 488-489) laid down certain prudent rules: "Women who are not 606 independent should not be arrested (for offences like adultery); it is the male who should be regarded as the offender; women should be punished by their lord (i, e. the person on whom they depend) but the king should take away for punishment the male offender. Even if a woman whose husband has gone abroad be consigned to jail she should be kept imprisoned only till he returns." The Sm. O. II. p. 323 explains that the first verse applies to a woman who can perform the

expiation for adultery and who is dependent and the adultery is not with a male of a lower caste. 

Nār. (II. 40) lays down 607 a qualification that when a party has been defeated by his own conduct (ie, by his demeanour or by his having adduced manifestly false witnesses or forged documents) there is to be no retrial or review of judgment, but where a man has lost his cause through (the dishonesty of) witnesses or the sabhyas, the cause may be tried anew. There are four exceptions to the finality of the judgments of the king's court. Where a litigant either through folly or insolence Gos thinks a decision to be wrong, he may be allowed a retrial, provided he agrees to pay double the fine inflicted on the losing party (Yaj. II. 306, Nār. I. 65, Kāt. 496). Secondly, where the former judgment is obtained by fraud or force, it may be set aside (Yāj. II. 31) 609, Thirdly, where the litigant was incompetent, i.e. was a woman or a minor or a lunatic or intoxicated, seriously ill or distressed by a calamity or where the proceeding was carried on by another on behalf of a litigant who did not appoint him or with whom he was not connected in any way or was held inside a house or outside a town or village (i. e, in a forest) or by an enemy, the decision may be set aside and a retrial ordered (Nar. I. 43 in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 16, Yāj. II. 31-32). Fourthly, a king could set right a former decision of his predecessor which was unjust and arrived at through ignorance (Mit. on Yaj, II. 806 ) 610. 

Yaj. ( II. 4 and 303 ) prescribes that legal proceedings that are suspected to have been wrongly decided by the sabhyas through partiality or greed or intimidation should again be tried by the king and if the suspicion turns out to be true he should levy from the sabhyas and the party who at first succeeded double the fine that is imposed on a defeated party. Nar. 1. 66 (in 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 22) is similar. Manu IX. 231 ( = Matsya 227. 158 )

and 234 prescribe that when officers appointed to administer justice cause loss to litigants by taking bribes, the king should deprive them of all their wealth and when the amatyas (ministers ) or chief justice disposes of a matter wrongly (but without being bribed ), the king should himself decide the matter correctly and should impose on the amātyas or chief justice a fine of 1000 panas. 

Though there is hardly any express smrti text for the transfer of cases from one court or judge to another court or judge, in practice this must have been done, though rarely. In "Seleotions from Peshwa's Daftar" vol. 43 p. 108 there is a letter (of 12-8-1764 A, D.) written by the renowned minister Nana Phadnis to the Peshwa Madhavrao in which the former endeavours to persuade the latter to cancel his order for transfer of a case from the court of Rāmsāstri, famed for his impartiali ty and strict life, to another judge on the ground that one of the litigants was afraid that Rāmsāstri showed some partiality to the other litigant. Manu (VIII. 174-175 ) states that the king who decides the causes of people unjustly through greed is soon subjugated by his enemies, while the king who curbing his own temper and desires impartially decides causes according to the dictates of śāstra becomes of one mind with his subjects as rivers merge in the ocean. Br. and Nār. I. 74 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 24) lay emphasis on both the secular and spiritual effects of doing even justice, saying that when the king gives decisions according to śāstra he spreads his fame in this world and secures Heaven 611 

A crime may be defined as an act or omission that breaks the law and is subject to public punishment. But all kinds of breaches of the law do not result in punishment; only some do. Those breaches are crimes which are deemed to be menaces to the conditions of existence of society, which society, the ruler or legislation recognises as preventible only through punishment. The menace is not that of the specific action, but the abstract menace inherent in that type of action. A breach that is held to be a crime at one time may even be held not to be a crime at another time or in another country. For example, adultery is a crime under the Indian Penal Code (sec. 497), while it is not a crime but a civil wrong in English Law.

Evolution of the idea of crimes 

387 

Many crimes and wrongs were sing and entailed secular punishments and also religious sanctions (viz. expiations, prāyascittas). Vide Manu IX, 236, 240, Bf. (S. B. E. vol. 33, P. 36%, verse 22 ) and Paithivasi quoted below 612 Maine in his * Ancient Law' chap. X (3rd ed. of 1866 ) examines ancient Western systems like those of Greece and Rome and makes the generalisation (p. 370) that the 'penal law of ancient communities is not the law of crimes; it is the law of wrongs or, to use the English technical word, of Torts. The person injured proceeds against the wrong-doer by an ordinary civil action and recovers compensation in the shape of money damages if he succeeds'. Dr. Priya Nath Sen in his Tagore Law Lectures on 'Hindu Jurisprudence '(1918, Lecture XII) rightly points out that this generalisation is not applicable to Ancient Hindu Law. It has already been shown (on pp. 264–266 ) that the king could of his own motion take cognisance of many wrongs called chalas, padas and aparādhas and it is clear that in such crimes as theft, assault, adultery, rape, and manslaughter the smrti texts do not prescribe only a money compensation to the person wronged, but corporal punishment in the first instance and monetary compensation in addition. Vide for example, Manu VIII. 287, Yāj. IL 22%, Bṛ. (SBE Vol. 33 p. 358 verses 9-10), Kat. (787) which prescribe a punishment for causing pain to the body or the loss of a limb and also the expenses of curing the person injured and some solatium to him. 613 Āp. Dh. S. (1. 9. 24. 1 and 4) lays down that the slayer of a ksatriya should give a thousand cows in order to remove the enmity (i. e. as compensation to rela tives ) and one bull in addition for expiation.614 The Chandogya Upaniṣad quoted above (p. 362 ) shows that a thief was punished with death in those early days. There is a passage in the Tai.S. II.

6.10.1 ( quoted in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 151 n. 346 ) which states, * He who threatens a brāhmana should be made to pay a hundr ed, he who strikes a brahmana should be made to pay a thousand', It is rather doubtful whether the figures stated are fines or are meant as solatium to the wronged. In Rg. II. 32. 4 ( which also occurs in Tai. S. III. 3. 11. 5) the poet prays to Rākā 61s (the Full Moon personified) that she may be pleased to grant the boon of a valiant son, who would be satadāya'. Sayapa's rendering of this word as 'possessed of plentiful beritage or wealth' appears to be the right one. The words 'satadāyam viram 'in the Tai, S. III. 3. 11. 5 are translated by Prof. Keith as *a hero whose wergild is a hundred'. This is incorrect, confound ing as it does the ideas of western Germanic tribes with the Rgveda composed several millenniums earlier. It would be a strange thing to pray to a goddess for a son and at the same time to have in mind or refer to the price set upon him if he happened to be killed. 

The ancient smrti writers were quite aware of the several purposes served by punishments for crimes, 616 though they do pot develop a regular science of penology. The person wronged feels a great urge for revenge or retaliation and other men sympathise with that emotion. The individual, however, could not, in civilized societies, take the law into his own hands and therefore the State saw to it that the emotion for retaliation or revenge was to some degree satisfied by the adequate punishment of the wrongdoer. Yāj. II. 16 and Nār. I. 46 (SBE vol. 33 p. 17) state that when a person without complaining to the king sets about to secure what is denied by the opposite side or is doubtful he becomes liable to punishment and he also cannot secure the object he wants. 61662 In all ancient societies the lex talionis ( the law of retaliation, viz, an eye for an eye

V. 19 and Saṅkha-Likhita prescribe that with whatever limb 618 man of low caste offends against a brahmana, that very limb of his shall be cut off. Another and the most important purpose of punishment is deterrent. Punishment of the evil-doer serves as an example and a warning to all others that might be tempted to tread the paths of violence and crime. This aspect of punishment ( daṇda ) has already been dwelt upon in the section on rajadharma (p. 21 ). The end sought to be served by punishment was the protection of society and the securing of its happiness. The Sāntiparva (15.5-6) remarks that people do not commit sins through fear of punish ment at the hands of the king, through fear of Yama and of the next world and through fear of others (i. e, publio opinion ).619 Gaut. XI. 28 derives the word dança from the root dam to restrain or to deter. This purpose of punishment is well brought out in the Mșcchakatika (X) when the sentence passed on Cārudatta for the alleged murder of Vasantasenā is proclaimed to the citizens by the executioners, 620 Another purpose of punishment is preventive i. e, if a culprit is imprisoned for an offence he is prevented or disabled from repeating the same offence or

In the 8th Table in Ortolan's History of Roman Law' (tr, by Pritchard and Nasmyth, 1871 ) p. 114 the 2nd provision is: 'retaliation against him who breaks the limb of another and does not offer compensation'. In Hammurabi's Code (text tr. by C. H. W. Johns, 1903 ) sections 196 and 200 are: 'If a man has caused the loss of a gentleman's eye, bis eye one shall cause to be lost. If a man has made the tooth of a man that is his equal to fall, one shall make his tooth to fall out',

committing further offences for some time at least and if he be sentenced to death or transported for life or banished, the commission of offences by him is prevented for his life-time. Another purpose was that of reform or redemption of the evil doer. The punishment was deemed to be a sort of expiation, which purged the man of sinful promptings and reformed his character. Manu VIII. 318 ( =Vas. 19. 45 ) states that men who are guilty of crimes and have been punished by the king go to heaven, becoming pure like those who perform meritorious deeds. Medhātithi remarks on this verse that this applies only where the punishment is corporal and not merely monetary. It will be seen from the early sūtras like that of Gautama and from the Manusmrti that the more ancient criminal law in India was very severe and drastic, but that from the times of Yājāavalkya, Nār. and Bṛ. the rigour of punishments was lessened and softened and fines came to be the ordinary punishments for many crimes, as is noted by Fa Hien (399-400 A, D.) in relation to middle India (Madhyadeśa) under the Guptas apparently: The king governs without decapitation or other corporal punishments. Criminals are simply fined, lightly or heavily according to the circumstances. Even in circumstances of repeated attempts at wicked rebellion they only have their right hands cut off' (Legge, 1886 p. 43). This may be contrasted with the state of things depicted by Megasthenes 700 years earlier than Fa Hion: (Fragment XXVII p. 71) 'a person bearing false witness suffers mutilation of his extremities. He who maims anyone not only suffers loss of the same limb but his hand also is cut off. If he causes an artisan to lose his hand and eye he is put to death'. The Dasakumāracarita (II. p.56) states that the Mauryas conferred a boon on traders that for certain offences they were not to be sentenced to death, but were to be deprived of all their wealth and banished. The first separate Rock Edict of Aśoka at Dhauli (Corpus I. I. pp. 93, 97 ) shows that great Emperor's anxiety that his judicial officers should strive to see that there is no undeserved fettering or no undeserved harsh treatment. In India the list of capital offences at any time was much shorter than in the West. Stephens is constrained to admit that in England 'there can be no doubt that the legis lation of the 18th century in criminal matters was severe to the highest degree and destitute of any sort of principle or system' (His. of Cr. Law, vol. I. p. 471). As stated by Dr. Hart (in 'Way to justice' p. 94), at the beginning of the 19th century in England more than a hundred offences were

punishable by death. In 1832 a child was convicted at Lud gate Hill for stealing a box of paints worth two pence, was tried at the Old Bailey and hanged (vide 'In the service of youth', by Dr. J. M. Brew, 1943 chap. XV. p. 208). 

Manu VIII. 129, Yāj. I. 367 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 387 verse 5), Vṛddha-Hārita (7.195) speak of four methods of punishment ( dangla ) viz. by gentle admonition, by severe reproof, by fine and by corporal punishment and declare that these punishments may be inflicted separately or together according to the nature of the offence. 621 The first takes the form of saying you have not done a proper thing', the 2nd 'fie upon you who are a wrongdoer and guilty of adharma'. Br. lays down that preceptors, purohitas and sons should be sentenced to the punishment of wordy admonition, other persons who engage in disputes should be punished with reproof or fines and those guilty of mahāpatakas should be punished with corporal punishment. That admonition and reproof were two modes of punishment shows that ancient writers were alive to the notion that among very sensitive persons or in a very sensitive society verbal condemnation would be enough to achieve the main purposes of punishment. Bp. ( SBE vol. 33. p. 388 verse 8 ) states that the first two are within the privilege of the brāhmaṇa (appointed as chief justice) but fines and corporal punishment are to be inflicted by the king (on the recommendation of the chief justice, prūdvivākamate sthitaḥ ). The Mșcchakaṭika (IX) bears this out when the judge says 'We have authority only to pronounce the judgment; as to the rest the king is the final authority (nirnaye vayan pramānam śeṣe tu rūja). Gaut. XII. 51, Vas. 19.9, Manu VII. 16, VIIL 126 and Yaj. I. 368 (=Vfddha-Harita VII. 195–196), Bșhat Park sara p. 284, Kaut.

fact whether the offence 622 is repeated. This provision means that the dharmaśāstras did not hold that the same punishment must be meted out for the same offence irrespective of the antecedents, characteristics or physical and mental condition of the offender. They always took extenuating circumstances into account. Kaut. (I. 4), differing from the view of the ācāryas that there is no thing like danda for bringing under one's complete control all beings, gives his own opinion that, as a king whose control and punishments are most severe makes the subjects disgusted with him and as the king who deals mild punishments is disregarded by the people, the king should distribute punishments according to the deserts of the offenders and would then command respect. 623 One reason why some of the works on dharmaśāstra prescribe mild punishments is the doctrine of karmavipāka (a man committing certain sins is born in the next life afflicted with certain diseases or bodily deficiencies or is born as a low or filthy beast or bird). Vide Manu XI. 49-52, Yāj. III 207-216, Visnu Dh. S. 44-45. This doctrine will be dealt with later on under pātaka and prāyaścitta. Gaut. XII. 48 first provides that the king must take into account, when awarding punishment to the criminal, his physical or monetary circumstances, the nature of the crime, the fact of repetition of the crime and then adds that the king should award punishment after consulting an assembly of learned brāhmaṇas. The Dandaviveka (p. 36 ) quotes a verse in which the considerations that should weigh in award ing punishment are brought together viz. the offender's caste (as in Manu VIII. 337-338 for theft), the value of the thing, the extent or measure (as in Manu VIII. 320), use or usefulness of the thing with regard to which an offence is committed (as in Manu VIII.285), the person against whom an offence is committed (such as an idol or temple or king or brāhmaṇa), age, ability to pay),

qualities, time, place, the nature of the offence (whether it is repeated or is a first offence). The Rājatarangini (VIII. 158.) provides that in disputes where parties are in doubt as to their rights it is proper to award punishment with forbearance but where a man starts on an evil path of set purpose ( the king and officers) must award severe punishment. In modern times there are controversies among several schools of criminology. Some hold that every man has freedom to act criminally or not or to act in the way he does and that each man has complete moral responsibility for his own'acts. On the other hand there are some who go to the other extreme and propound that a so-called criminal act is mostly due to biological, physiological, patho logical or sociological conditions, to the upbringing and environment of the person charged with crime. They favour determinism. The ancient Indian writers do not enter into these speculations. But when they said that regard must be paid to time and place and other considerations they were faintly conscious of or were groping towards the ideas of the 2nd school. 

Fines are either fixed or not fixed (i.. variable). They range from a kākini to the confiscation of all wealth ; fixed fines were of three kinds called prathama sāhasa, madhyama sāhasa (middling amercement) and uttama sāhasa (bighest). These are Variously defined. According to Saṅkha-Likbita the first 624 amercement is fine from 24 panas to 91, the middling one is from 200 to 500 panas and the highest is from six hundred to 1000

There was great divergence of views about the metal in which the fines were to be paid. According to Vijñānesvara the figures of fines in such verses as Manu VIII. 378 (where no metal is specified ) the panas are those of copper, wbile according to Bharuchi ( quoted in S. V, p. 150 ) they are of gold. The S. V, remarks that local usage is to be followed, The V. Mayūkha (p. 255 ) states that in all texts (about fiaes) the mention of a number without specifying the object to which it refers is to be deemed to refer to panas, that pana is a copper piece one karsa in weight and that karsa is one fourth of a pala. Br. '(q. by Sm. C. II. p. 99) states that the tables in Manu (VIII. 132-136) beginning with the dust particle in a beam and ending with kārsāpana is to be followed in ordeals and fines. An interesting sidelight is shed on crimes and their punishments in the In scription of Calukya Vikramaditya V (dated saka 934) from Gadag which provides that the fines' for abuse, assault, for drawing out a dagger, for stabbing and for adultery by a bachelor were respectively 2 pagas, 12 panas, 3 gadyāṇas, 12 gadyānas and 3 gadyānas (vide.

in proportion to the value of the matter in dispute or the injury caused. Manu VIIL 138 ( =Viṣnu Dh. S. IV. 10) states that the first, middling and highest fines are respectively 250, 500 and 1000 panas, while Yāj. I. 366 puts these respectively at 270, 540 and 1080. The Mit. explains that the lesser figures of Manu re present the fines to be awarded for offences committed without set purpose. Nār. ( sābasa, verses 7-8) prescribes that 100 paṇas is the lowest limit of fines for the lowest kind of sāhasa, 500 is the lowest for middling sāhasa, 1000 is the lowest fine in what is called the highest amercement (and might include death penalty, forfeiture of all property, banishment, branding and cutting off of a limb). Fines were supposed to be lesser than corporal punishment. Kat. ( 490-493 ) lays 625 down the follow ing rules : Whatever figure of fine is prescribed in the smrti texts for a wrong it is to be paid to the king in papas of copper or their equivalent. Where the fine is said to be one-fourth or one half of a māṣa, there it is a golden māṣa that is meant; when the fine is declared in māṣas, they are to be understood as those of silver and where the fine is declared in kļṣṇalas the same is to be understood; a māsa is myth of a kārṣāpaṇa.' The general rule that lesser punishment is to be inflicted on women is stated by Kāt. ( 487 ) 'In the case of all offences, women are to Buffer half of the fine in money which is prescribed for a male offender of the same kind ) and when the punishment is death for a male, the punishment for a woman would be the excision of a limb. 636 Kaut. (III. 3) provides:' a woman attains ability to enter into transactions on completion of 12 years and men when they are 16; if they disobey after that (i. e, after attaining majority ) the woman shall be fined twelve panas and a man twice that amount.' 627 Angiras quoted by the Mit.

III. 243 ) states that 628 an old man over eighty, a boy below sixteen, women and persons suffering from diseases are to be given half prayasoitta and Saṅkha quoted by the Mit. (on the same Verse) that a child less than five commits no crime nor sin by any act and is not to suffer any punishment nor to undergo a prayascitta 629, Under the Indian Penal Code, 800, 82, nothing is an offence which is done by a child under seven years of age. The severity of punishment depended on caste also. In the case of theft, Gaut. XII. 15-16, Manu VIII. 338-39 prescribe that a vaisya, a kṣatriya and a brāhmaṇa should respectively be fined twice, four times and eight times of the fine to be imposed upon a sūdra for a theft, since each of these is deemed more and more aware of the heinousness of the crime. Kāt. ( 485 ) and Vyāsa state this as a general rule for all offences 630. In the case of abuse and defamation the scales are turned in favour of the higher castes as regards fines. Gaut. XII. 1, 8-12, Manu VIII. 267-268 (=Nār. pārusya 15-16), Yāj. II. 206-207 prescribe that a kṣatriya or a vaisya or a sūdra abusing or defaming a brāhmaṇa was to be respectively punished with the fine of 100 paṇas, 150 paṇas and with corporal punishment (cutting off the tongue), while a brāhmana defaming & kṣatriya, vaisya or sūdra was to be fined 50, 25 or 12 paṇas respectively (nothing in the last case acc. to Gaut. XII. 13). In the case of adultery and rape the caste of the offender and of the woman concerned made great difference in the punishment awarded. For adultery with a woman of the same caste Yāj. II. 286 prescribed the highest amercement, the middling one when the paramour was of a higher caste, but if the male be of a lower caste than the woman, the male offender was sentenced to death and the woman had her ears cut off. Corporal punishment assumes (as pointed out by the Daṇdaviveka p. 20) various forms accor ding as it is meant to cause only harassment (pain) or is

Harassment or pain may be inflicted by imprisonment, beating, putting fetters, by making ridiculous (by the complete shaving of the head, declaring the offence - by beat of drum in the presence of the convict, parading him through the streets on an ass ) and marking him with signs indicative of offences like theft. Manu (VIII. 125) provides that punishment may fall upon any one (or more) of ten places in the case of the three higher castes, viz. the private parts, the belly, the tongue (either whole or half), the hands, the feet, the eyes, the nose, the ears, wealth and the whole body; but a brāhmaṇa shall depart unhurt from the country (i, e. he is to be only banished). Br. (SBE, 33 p. 388 verses 9-10) speaks of fourteen places of punishment adding the neck, the thumb and index, the fore head, the lips, the hind part, hips, one half of the feet (to Mapu's ten) and omitting wealth and the whole body there from. Gaut. XII. 43, Kauṭ. IV. 8, Manu (VIII. 125, 380-381 ), Yaj. II. 270, Nār. ( sahasa, 9-10), Viṣṇu V. 1-8, Br. (SBE, vol. 33 p. 388 verse 11), Výddha-Harita VII. 191 prescribe that a brāhmana was not to be sentenced to death or corporal punishment for any offence whatever, but if he were guilty of an offence deserving the death penalty, he was to be punished by ordering his entire head to be shaved, he might be banished from the country (from the city acc. to Nār.), a mark appro. priate to the grave sin committed by him might be 'branded on his forehead and he might be paraded on an ass.631 Yama, 632 quoted by Sm.

Punishments for a brāhmana offender

the king to keep & brahmapa offender in confinement in a secret place and give him bare maintenance or the king may make him do the work of guarding cattle for a month or a fortnight or make him perform other work not fit for a decent brahmapa. The Mit.' on Yāj. II. 270 explains that the mark of female private parts for violating, guru's bed, of a tavern for drinking the liquor called surā, a dog's foot for theft, of a headless corpse for brāhmana murder (as laid down by Manu 

IX. 237 and 240, Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 4) is to be made on the forehead only if the offender (whether a brāhmaṇa or not) did not perform prāyascitta for those grave sins. Branding with marks appropriate to the crime committed were in vogue in Rome and in Britain up to 1699 (such as the mark of the letter M for murderers, T for thieves &c.). Vide Barnes' 'Story of punishment' p. 62. The Rā jatarangini (IV. 96-106) refers to a case in the reign of king Candrāpida of Kashmir when a brāhmana guilty of the murder of a brālmana was exempted from death sentence because of the smrti rule. Manu IX, 241 gives option that a brāhmana (unintentionally ) guilty of grave offences may be punished with the middle amercement or he may be banished from the realm keeping all his wealth. The punishments for a brahmana offender, according to Gaut. XII. 44, were preventing him from doing the same thing again, depriving him of all wealth, taking sureties from him, proclaiming him as a thief in the city banishment, putting on his forehead the mark indicative of his crime. Ap. Db.s. (II. 10.27. 16-17) 633 lays down that a brābmana guilty of murder, theft, forcible seizure of another's land, was to have his eyes covered over with cloth for the whole of his life (while a sūdra guilty of any of the three was to receive the death sentence ). Vrddha-Hārīta (VII.209-210) says that a brāhmaṇa should be branded on the body for all those offences that entailed corporal punishment for other offenders, that he should have his head shaved, that he should be deprived of all his property and banished from the realm. The force of popular feeling on the point of exempting a brāhmaṇa offender from the death sentence was so great that Elphinstone (Governor of Bombay) in Regu lation 14 of 1827, soc. IV (ol. 5) exempted brahmanas and women from death sentence even for murder where public feeling would

be shocked 634. It is not to be supposed that this exemption of the brahmana from the death sentence was unanimous or uni versal. Kāt. (806) contains this remarkable statement: 635 Even a brāhmana deserves to be killed if he be guilty of

II. p. 126. Medhātithi on Manu VIII, 125 makes it clear that the absence of a fine occurs only in the case of a brāhmana who was a first offender, who did not commit the offence with forethought and who was endowed with learning, good family and character. The Sm. C. II. p. 124 relying on Manu IX. 236 says that a brāhmaṇa could be imprisoned but he could not be subjected to such corporal punishment as cuttiog off a limb or wbipping. The Smrtis openly regarded the brāhmana's person as sacred and so saved his body. The smrtis endeavoured to reacb the ideal of the rule of law and succeeded to a great extent in doing so. They beld that every man, whatever his rank or condition, was subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals. The only differential treatment that we find is in the appointment of judges (pp. 272 273), in the order of taking up causes of litigants (p. 298), in the punishment for perjury (Manu VIII. 123-124), in the matter of corporal punishment. in abuse, defamation and assault (pp.395-397), in punishment for adultery, in the repayment of debts and in the punishment for theft, which was severer for a brahmana. It will be shown below that from the 13th century, as indicated by the Sm. C., S. V. and Madanarataa, differential punishments had gode out of vogue. The smrtis did not, like some modern freedom-loving people, declare the equality of all before the law on paper and in practice indulge in lynching. Further the smrtis required all offenders of whatever caste to be brought before the same tribunals. Maou VIII. 335 and Yaj. I. 358 emphasize that there is aone who is exempt from punishment in the king's court whether the person be the king's father or teacher or friend or mother or wife or a son or a family priest or brother or father-in law or maternal uncle. Saṅkha-Likhita and Kāt. (481) no doubt say that a king should not punish his parents, his family priest, teacher, near relatives, forest hermits, ascetics. But, as the Sm. C. II. p. 126 explains, the real meaning is not that the king is to allow these to escape scot-free, but that he should not inflict corporal punishments or fines on these, but should employ admonition or severe reproof towards them. The smrtis do not contain rules like those in the Indian Criminal Pro. Code entitling Europeans and Americans in India to claim a jury preponderantly composed of their countrymen and claiming trial only by the High Court or liko the privileges of the English Peers to be tried only by the House of Lords for felonies or the doctrine of the benefit of clergy abolished in 1827. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 140-143 and 147-152 about certain privileges of brāhmanas.

Death sentence for a brahmana

causing abortion, if he be a thief (of gold) or if he kills a brāhmaṇa woman with a sharp Weapon or if he kills & chaste woman'. Kautilya (IV. 11) prescribes that a brāhmaṇa who aims at the kingdom or who forces entrance into the king's harem or who incites wild tribes or enemies (against his king ) or who foments disaffection (or rebellion) in forts, the country or the army should be sentenced to death by drowning. 636 The fact that Cārudatta, a brāhmapa, is represented as having been condemned to death by king Palaka in the Mrochakatika indicates that the sentence of death against brāhmaṇas was not entirely unheard of. It appears from Fick's 'Social organisation' &c. p. 212 that in many Jataka passages the execution of brāhmaṇas is referred to. 

The Sāntiparva chap. 268 contains an interesting dialogue between king Dyumatsena and his son prince Satyavat on the subject of the punishment of death, which contains some of the arguments forcibly urged in these days by those that are opposed to capital punishment altogether. The prince pleads that punishment should be light even for grave offences, that when the sentence of death is carried out in the case of robbers, 636a several innocent persons (such as the wife, the mother, the son of the condemned man) suffer great loss (and they may die also ), that if offenders give themselves up to priests, swear before them that they will never commit sin, they may be let off after undergoing penance, that if great men go astray their punishment should be proportionate to their greatness. The king replies that in former ages when people were most truthful, soft-hearted, and not hot-tempered the punishment of saying 'fie on you' sufficed, then vocal remonstrances and upbraidings sufficed, but in the later ages (of Kali) corporal punishment and death sentence bave to be resorted to and that some people are not deterred even by the fear of death sentence. 

A few remarks will be made on each of the several modes of punishment. The sentence of death was, acc. to Kām. XIV. 16, Sukra IV, 1.93, to be avoided even in the gravest offences

except for the offence of subverting the state.637 Viṣnu Dh. 8. V. 1 provides that all persons except brāhmaṇas guilty of the mahāpātakas may be sentenced to death. But Manu IX. 236 says that this extreme penalty was to be awarded only if they performed no prāyascitta. Kaut. (IV. 11) prescribes death sentence for causing the death of any one with a sharp weapon. Vrddha-Hārsta (VII. 190) prescribes it for incendiaries, poisoners, murderers, robbers, bad characters, rogues and those guilty of grave sins. The death sentence was carried out in various ways such as by giving poison or by trampling at the feet of an elephant, or by a sharp weapon (like a sword), by being burnt or drowned 638. Impalement was a punishment pres cribed by Manu IX. 276 for thieves guilty of housebreaking by night ( after first cutting off their hands ), by Yāj. II. 273 for those who made another a captive or stole horses and elephants or killed another by the use of force and by Vrddha Hārita VII. 202 for the murderer of a brāhmaṇa or for one who killed a woman, a child or a cow. Death sentence by being trampled under the feet of an elephant continued up to the times of the Marathas. The Dasakumāracarita 4th Uochvāsa shows that & thief could be trampled upon by an elephant by way of punishment. Vide 'Selections from Peshwa's Daftar' (edited by Mr. G. S. Sardesai) vol. 43 No. 143 p. 114 ( dated 7-9-1775 A. D.), where out of seven dacoits of the Berad caste two were ordered to be trampled to death at the feet of an elephant 639 and five were ordered to be simply beheaded. Death sentence is said by the Dandaviveka (p. 20) to be simple 

śuddha), which is of two kinds, avicitra when the offender is beheaded ( with a sword), and citra or vicitra ( when the offender is impaled of burnt ) and it is miśra ( when his hands or feet or other limbs are cut off and then he is killed ) 640. Simple death

is prescribed by Manu IX. 271 for those who abet thieves by giving them subsistence, instruments of house-breaking or asylum, If a man of a low caste had sexual intercourse with a woman of a higher caste (with or without her consent) or kidnapped a maiden he was to be sentenced to death (Manu VIII. 366, Yāj. II. 286-288, 294). Vas. XXI. 1-5 prescribed for a śūdra, vaisya or ksatriya guilty of adultery with a brāhmaṇa woman the horrible punishment of being burnt to death after being respectively covered with virana grass, with red darbhas and sara leaves respectively and similar punishment for a śūdra paramour of a ksatriya or vaisya woman and for a vaisya paramour of a kṣatriya woman. The consenting woman (adulteress) was, acc. to Vas. XXI. 1-3, to be shaved, to have her head anointed with clarifi ed butter and to be paraded naked on an ass and left to die on the Great Journey, while, acc. to Gaut. XXIII. 14 and Manu VIII. 371, an adulteress, vain of her charms or the wealth of her parents, was to be openly devoured by dogs, if her paramour was a man of lower caste. Saṅkha 641 prescribes this punishment ( of being devoured by dogs ) for a woman's paramour of a lower caste and for the erring woman death by burning. Vṇddha-Harita VII. 192 prescribes that in the case of a woman who is a confirmed adul teress, or who destroys her foetus, her husband should have her ears, nose and lips cut off and then she should be banished and verses 220-221 prescribe death by being burnt with grass (katāgni) for those guilty of incest. These severe penalties for adultery were very much relaxed and softened by later smrti writers as is shown in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 571-573. A man who made a breach in the embankment of a lake or tank ( and thereby caused it to become dry ) may be sentenc ed to death by drowning (Manu IX. 279 ) or a woman who was extremely wicked (such as one who killed her own child in the womb ) or who murdered a man or who destroyed the embankments of a tank may have a stone tied round her neck and be drowned, provided she be not pregnant at the time of the sentence (Yaj. II. 278). Yāj. IL 279 (=Matsyapurana 227. 200 ) prescribes death by being gored by the horns of bulls (after the nose, lips, ears and hands are cut off) for a woman who is guilty of poisoning (the food or drink of another) or who is guilty of incendiarism or who kills her husband, elders

or her own child (provided she is not pregnant) 642. Yāj. II. 282 provides death by being burnt with the fire of straw for those who set fire to growing crops, houses, forests, village, pastures and threshing floors or who approach the queen. Nār. (pāruṣya, Verse 31) prescribes that one who strikes with a weapon the king, even though the latter be at fault, should be impaled and roasted in fire. These examples are enough to convey an idea of the crimes for which the sentence of death was provided in some of the ancient smptis. Manu VIII. 272, Nār. (pāruṣya 24), Viṣnu Dh. 8. V. 24 prescribe the pouring of boiling oil in the mouth and ears of a sūdra who through insolence tries to expound dharma to brahmaṇas. Cutting off limbs as a punishment (particularly hands and feet or fingers ) was common in the case of thieves, pickpockets and cut-purses (Manu IX. 276-277, Nār., parisista verse 32, Yaj. II. 274). Excision of the tongue was the sentence when a sūdra abused a brāh mana or a kṣatriya by falsely charging him with some grave sin (Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 27. 14, Manu VIII. 270, Nārada, pāruṣya 22), when a sudra loudly repeated the Veda along with twice-born persons (Gaut. XII. 4), when a person abused the king ( Nār., pārusya 30 ), when a person repeatedly proclaimed what was disliked by the king or divulged the secret policy of the king ( Yaj. II. 302 ). Excision of the male organ was prescribed for a sūdra who sexually approached a woman of the three higher varnas (Gaut. XII. 2), for any one guilty of the rape of another's wife (Vrddha-Harita VII. 201 and also confiscation of all property ), for any one guilty of incest or intercourse with mother, mother's sister, paternal aunt, sister, 

: 642. The general rule was that women were not to be killed on any account. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 575, 593–94. Certain offences were exceptions. Even as to them Vas, XXI, 10 and Yaj, I. 72 suggest another and very mild alternative viz. abandonment (tyāga), when a woman con. ceives from intercourse with a man of lower varna or when a woman was guilty of killing her busband or foetus, Acc. to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 268 the king appears to have had to undergo some expiation for ordering the death of a guilty woman. In the 18th century the famous judge of the Peshwa's court, Rāmsastri Prabhune, ordered a woman guilty of & brah maṇa's murder to undergo only the expiation of circumambulating the holy shrine and bill of Tryambakesvara near Nasik ("Selections from Peshwa's Daftar', vol. 43 No. 156 pp. 121-122). Under sec, 382 of the Indian Cri. minal Procedure Code 'if a woman sentenced to death is found to be preg. Aant, the High Court shall order the execution of the sentence to be post poned and may, if it thiols fit, commute the sentence to transportation for life',

The nose, the ears and the hands were out off in the case of an offender guilty of selling false gold or forbidden flesh such as that of a dog ( Yāj. II. 297 ). For branding, vide Gaut. XII. 44, Baud. Dh. S. I. 10. 19, Nār. (sāhasa 10), Manu XL 237 (=Matsya 227.16), Viṣnu Dh. S. V.3-7. The Daṇdaviveka (p. 47) states that branding was to be resorted to if the proper penance was not performed and if the offence was intentional. Yaj. II. 202 provides branding for a gambler using false dice and (II. 294) for persons of the three higher varnas having intercourse with a very low caste woman and Daksa VII. 33 prescribes it for an ascetic giving up his duties. The Rājatarangipi mentions ( VI. 108-112 ) that king Yaśaskara (939-948 A. D.) of Kashmir branded on a brāhmaṇa's forehead the mark of dog's foot. Kośavapandita in his Dandaniti-prakarana (p. 6) quotes the author of the Vaijayanti (Nanda-pandita) to the effect that the making of marks was to be effected with the juice of the marking nut in the case of brāhmaṇas and with a red-hot iron salākā in the case of others. In England about a hundred years ago branding for desertion from the army was practised. Manu VIII. 370 prescribes the shaving of the head as a punish ment for a woman who pollutes a maiden, Nār. (śāhasa 10) preg cribes it for a brāhmaṇa who is not sentenced to death on account of his caste, Sapkha-Likhita (g. by Aparārka p. 807) for one who abuses officers, brāhmaṇas and elders. Megasthenes ( Fragment XXVII. p. 72 ) notes ' If one is guilty of a very heinous offence the king orders his hair to be cropped, this being a punishment to the last degree infamous'. Imprisonment for life is prescrib ed by Viṣnu V.71 for striking out both eyes of a man and by Sukra IV.1. 88 (for repeating an offence more than three times) For imprisonment with labour, vide Sukra IV. 1. 92 and 108-109. Flogging was prescribed 643 by Vishnu Dh. S. V. 105 for a woman. 

643. The punishment of whipping is allowed in England for several offences; vide Laws of England (ed. by Lord Hailsham, vol. IX, pp. 229-230). In India under the Prisons Act (IX of 1894) by section 46 whipping is allowod for certain prison offences and under the Whipping Act ( IV of 1909) whippiag is awarded for certain offences such as theft, house breaking, dacoity, rape and for juvenile offenders. In modern times many persons laterested in criminology and penology condemn most strongly the stentences of death and whipping.

in her monthly course touching intentionally members of the higher castes. It was also prescribed for offenders who were slaves or who were dependents and for women, minors, lunatics, old men, poor men and those suffering from diseases ( Kat.). The punishment of banishment was prescribed for brāhmaṇas guilty of the gravest offences meriting death sente noe (Gaut. XII. 44, Manu IX. 241, VIII. 380, Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 3 and 8, Baud Dh, S. I. 10. 19, Yaj. II. 270 ). It was often associated with branding. Banishment is also prescribed by Yāj. I. 339 for officers taking bribes (and also confiscation of all wealth), for a perjured brahmana witness (Yāj. II. 81 ), for one who embezzles the money of a corporation or transgresses the conventions agreed upon by a guild or village &c ( Yāj. II. 187, Manu VIII. 219, Visṇu Dh. S. V. 167-168 ), for playing with false dice (Yaj. II. 202 and Nār., dyūtasamahyaya 6), for a brāhmana guilty of very heinous offences 644 (Santi 14. 116). Sukra (IV.1. 98-108 ) contains a long list of offenders that deserve to be sentenced to banishment. Confiscation of all property was the punishment for several offences such as the commissa ion of the mahāpātakas by persons other than brāhmaṇas, provided they committed them unintentionally (Manu IX. 242), for perjury, for taking bribes by sabhyas (Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 179-180). Nār. (prakirpaka 10-11) provides a humane rule that even when the king orders the confiscation of all the property of an offender he should not deprive the offender of the tools of his trade or the tools of his craft, such as arms in the case of a soldier, materials of art in the case of artisans, ornaments of courtezans, musical instruments of musicians. Saṅkha-Likhita 645 quoted by V. R. p. 656 contain a similar provision. • Enhanced punishment was prescribed for committ ing an offence again. Viṣnu Dh. 8.

offence (though a first offender may be let off with a mere admonition). Kaut. IV. 10 states that when a person is a first offender as to theft at a holy place or as a pickpocket or house breaking from the roof, his thumb and index finger may be cut off or he may be fined 54 paṇas, for a second offence all fingers may be cut or a fine of 100 paṇas may be levied; for a third offence the punishment is cutting of the right hand or a fine of 400 panas and for the fourth death in any way the king may direct. Manu IX. 277, Yāj. II. 274, Viṣṇu Dh. S. V. 136 contain a similar rule. Vide Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 27. 11-13 for adultery. If several people conspire together and kill or injure a single man the punishment was to be double of what a single man committing the same offence would receive ( Kaut. III. 19, Yāj. II. 221, Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 73). As indicative of the superstitions of ancient (and even modern) times punishment for witchcraft may be mentioned. Kaut. IV. 4 prescribes 616 the employment of spies to find out those who profess to use charms for securing illicit love and banish them and adds that persons who are engag ed in witchcraft to injure others may be similarly dealt with. In the times of the Peshwas wizards 647 and raisers of ghosts appear to have been frequent and were severely dealt with by the peo ple themselves by being put to death, but the State generally confiscated the property or cut off the alleged wizard's finger. Up to the beginning of the 18th century even in England wretched old women were frequently convicted as witches and hanged 618

Manu IX. 290 (=Matsya 227. 183) prescribes the very mild punishment of the fine of 200 paṇas for all incantations intended to destroy life, for magic rites and various kinds of raising ghosts and gobling. Medhātithi and Kullūka say that if the magio rites are successful the punishment would be that for murder. Bp. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 361 verse 16 ) provides banish ment for those who practise incantations with roots. 

Kauṭ. in II. 5 prescribes 649 that a jail should be constructed in the capital provided with separate accommodation for men and women kept apart and well guarded at the entrances. He further provides 650 that among the duties of the nāgaraka is to let out of the jail on the day of the festival of the birth con stellation of the king and on the full moon day (of every month) such persons as are young, very old, suffering from diseases and helpless, or those who are charitably, disposed may pay the fines or others bind themselves by an agreement to pay in cash the fines for the offences for which the prisoners aro jailed (and then the prisoners may be released). The persons jailed may be set free on their working every day or once in five days or by undergoing corporal punishment (whipping &o.), paying fines in cash. Prisoners may be released from jail (as a favour) on the conquest of fresh territory or on the coronation of the Crown Prince or on the birth of a son to the king. In the Delhi Topra Pillar Edict No. IV (Corpus I. I vol." I. p. 123 and E. I. vol. II, pp. 253-54) Emperor Asoka promulgates that he gives three days' respite to prisoners on whom judgment has been passed and who have been condemned to death and in the 5th Pillar Edict of Delhi Topra (Corpus II vol. I. p. 126-128 and E. I. vol. II. pp. 258,259 ) he says that he let off prisoners 25 times in 26 years ( which is in conformity with Kauṭiya's dictum cited above). In the first separate Ediots at Dhauli Asoka addresses his officers of justice in the capital (Nagaravyāvahārikāh) that they should so act that even a single person should not unnecessarily suffer imprisonment or pain. In spite of this if we are to believe Yuan Chwang, Asoka in his early career was most cruel and had constructed a jail

that was called Hell-prison of Asoka (vide Watters, vol. II. pp. 88-90). Manu IX. 288 requires that all jails should be so built as to abut on the royal road where the offenders suffering pain and in bad condition would be seen by all (in order to deter others from committing offences ). The Silappadikāram, one of the earliest works in Tamil, mentiong the release of prisoners on the king's birthday and at the founding of a temple (pp. 38-39 of Mr. Dikshitar's translation). Kalidasa in the Malavikāgnimitra 651 (Act IV) makes the Vidūṣaka report to the king, 'the astrologers think that, as the constellation on which Your Majesty was born is in evil aspect now, let all prisoners be released'. Kalidasa ( in Raghu 17.19 ) alludes to the release of prisoners and the commutation of death sentences at the time of the coronation of king Atithi. The Bṛhat-Samhita ( 47.81 ) states that when the king takes the Puṣyasnūna (ceremonial bath on the day on which the moon is in conjunc. tion with the Puṣya constellation in the month of Pausa or every month ) he may order release except as to those prisoners who were convicted for offences connected with his own person or with the harem, 652 In the Mșcchakatika (Act X) also various occasions for the release of prisoners are mentioned by the executioner. The Harṣacarita 653 (IL 2nd para ) refers to the Usage of releasing prisoners at the time of a coronation and on the birth of Harṣa (IV. ). The prisoners are described in the latter passage as having long beards and as darkened by the accumulation of dirt on their bodies. 

Manu IX. 243 enjoins upon the king not to appropriate to himself the property of a man guilty of the mahāpātakas (by way of fine or confiscation) and warns that if he takes it out of greed he is tainted by the guilt of the offender. Manu (IX. 244-45 ) recommends that such fine may be cast into water as an offering to Varuna ( the Lord of waters ) who wields sceptre even over kings or may be bestowed on learned and virtuous

brāhmaṇas, that are lords of the whole world. Manu (IX. 246–247 ) further states that in the country where the king avoids taking the property of very wicked sinners men become long-lived, crops spring up, there is no infant mortality &c. 

Generally no one was allowed to take the law into his own hands except as to recovery of debts ( which will be discussed below). But Nār. (pārusya 654 11-14) contains the following remarkable passage: 'If a svapāka, a meda, a candāla, one devoid of a limb, one gaining livelihood by killing animals, an elephant driver, vrūtya (i. e. deprived of caste for non performance of upanayana), a slave, one who disregards his elders or spiritual teacher if these should transgress the limits they must observe towards their superiors, they should be punish ed then and there by the person offended and the person so doing is not regarded as committing an offence (equal to theft). Should any such low person insult another (who is his superior ) that man himself shall punish him and the king has nothing to do with the punishment. These people are like the refuse ( dregs) of humanity and their property also is impure. The king is entitled to inflict bodily punishment (whipping ), but he should not inflict fines on them'. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 270 quotes a text of Vṛddha-Manu of similar import and explains that the words 'the king should avoid taking fines' refer to cases of grave offences 655 

Something must be said about the law of Limitation. In the smrtis and digests rules of Limitation play very little part for several reasons. As on spiritual grounds, which will be set out under the title of rṇādāna, not only the debtor, but also his sons, grandsons and great-grandsons were liable to pay a debt (Mit. on Yāj. II. 50 ), there was no scope at all for prescribing any period of limitation so far as recovery of debts was concerned. Unpaid purchase money was treated as a debt. In other matters also the smrtis and dharmaśāstras, under the influence of religious and other-worldly considerations always lean against

allowing mere lapse of time to prevent a man from asserting his just rights. But rarely there were writers who were more secular and laid down periods of limitation. For example, Kauṇdinya 656 ( quoted in V. Matsaka p. 341 ) holds that a debt not claimed for ten years cannot be recovered except when the creditor was a minor or very old or was a woman or was suffer ing from disease or there was confusion due to invasion or (the oreditor or debtor ) had left the country. Some important rules on the law of Limitation are set out here in one place : 

1. Manu VIII. 148, Yaj. II. 24, Gaut. XII. 35, Vas. 16. 17, 

Nār. IV. 79 and others state that enjoyment of immovable property in the presence of the real owner without protest from him causes logs of ownership and ten years' enjoyment of movables under similar circumstances leads to the same result. There are various views on the subject which have already been 

indicated above ( on pp. 322-325 ). 2. An exception to the above rule is stated to be that no 

limitation applies to pledges. boundaries, deposits, and to the property of minors, idiots, the State, women and brāhmaṇas learned in the Vedas. Vide Gaut. XII. 35-36, Vas. 16. 18, Manu VIII. 149, Yāj. II. 25, Nār. 

IV. 81, Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 312 verse 21 ). 3. As the rules about deposit are extended by Nār. 

(upanidhi verse 14) to articles borrowed or given to artisans for being worked, and to anvāhita, nyāsa and pratinyāsa, in the case of these also there would be ordinarily no bar of limitation. Vide Manu VIII. 145-146, Yāj. II. 58, Viṣpu Dh. S. VI. 7-8. Here also there are dicta to the contrary. Marici (q. in Sm. C. II. p. 69 quoted above on p. 326 ) says that cows, beasts of burden, ornaments and the like borrowed in a friend. ly way would have to be returned (at the latest) in four or five years, otherwise they are lost. Aco. to Vyāsa 657 this rule would not apply to what is lent to

It appears that a period of twenty years was prescrib ed for avoiding a document on the ground of patent defects by one who had seen it and was affected by it. Vide Kāt. 298-300. Similarly when a thing is enjoyed for twenty years on the basis of a writing in the presence of an opponent able ( to challege the enjoyment and the writing) then the writing becomes unassailable (even if the witnesses are all dead or there is no other document for comparison).

A careful perusal will convince any unbiassed reader that the Dharma sāstras evolved during the course of centuries an indigenous system of judicial procedure of a high order. Nārada, Brhas pati and Katyāyana répresent the high water mark of ancient Indian adjective law. These writers flourished before 600 A, D. and the first two of them are probably older by several centu ries than that date. They present an orderly system providing for the appointment and duties of judges, proper pleadings, the law of evidence and limitation, decrees and their execution, crimes and punishments. This system compares most favour ably with any system of judicial procedure prevalent anywhere in the West up to the 18th century A. D.

## 16 Contracts

CHAPTER XVI. 

CONTRACTS 

There are only three titles of law, viz, recovery of debts, the relation of husband and wife (stripunsayoga) and partition of wealth (dāyabhāga) that are of importance to modern Hindus, since to a very large extent they are oven now governed in these matters by the ancient Hindu Law as interpreted by the commentators. These three topics therefore have to be described in detail while other titles will not and cannot be allowed to occupy much space. In almost all smrtis and digests of Hindu Law rṇādāna (recovery of debts) is treated of first. Therefore here also that subject will be taken up first. A good deal of the matter falling under the title of the relation of husband and wife has already been dealt with in the 2nd volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra pp. 427-636. The topic of dāyubhāga will be dealt with last of all, the other topics being taken up in the same order as in Manu. Many of the vyavahūrapadas are concerned with the law of contracts in various aspects, viz. the contract of debt, of pledge or mortgage, of bailments, of sale, of partnership, of hire and service. 

Our writers do not set out with an analysis of the con ception of contract in general. They had before them the ancient 18 titles of law, many of which related to various kinds of contracts and therefore they take up one title after another, in the order contained in Manu or in Nārada ( as the Sm, C. II. p. 206 expressly says). But it is not to be supposed that they did not evolve certain general principles about contracts. They do say a good deal about the competence of persons to enter into contracts, about fraud vitiating all contracts, about damages for breach of contract &q. Sim ilarly the dharma sāstras do not lay down a general Code of rules applicable to all transfers of' immovable property, nor do they treat of transfers by way of sale, mortgage or gift in separate sections. What they have to say on these transfers is tācked on to some vyavahārapada e. 8. they speak about sales and exchanges of land under asvāmi-vikraya and simāvivada, about gifts under dattāpradānika and about mortgages under pnādana. As this work has to represent what the ancient law was like the same412

| voi. 

arrangement has been followed here. Similarly the law of crimes is not to be found in one place. It is scattered under different titles of law such as vākpāruøya, dapdapārusya, sāhasa, strisangrahaṇa and steya; nor is there a complete analysis of intention or motive or of the right of private defence, although all these subjects are briefly dealt with in the smptis in different places. 

A great deal has been said by ancient writers about what. persons are competent to enter into transactions ( vyavahāra ) The Arthasastra (in III. 1 ) 661 has a lengthy disquisition on it Briefly, it holds that dependent persons, minors, extremely old people, those charged with grave sins, sannyāsins, persons who are devoid of a limb and those who are addicted to vices (like drinking and whoring) are incompetent and agreements made with such people are invalid. Among dependent people Kautilya mentiong a son whon the father is alive (and manages the affairs), a father when he has a son (who manages the family affairs ), a brother who has left the family, a younger brother whoge share has not been separated, a woman whose husband or son is alive, a slave or a hired servant. He states that these may enter into binding agreements if those on whom they are dependent authorize them to do so. He further says that contracts made by persons that are at the time of making them intoxicated or are under the influence of wrath or are distressed or are of unsound mind or under duregs (imprisoned or confined ) are invalid. Yāj. (II. 31-32) concisely puts down the same propositions by saying that all transactions brought about by force or fraud should be declared (by the king ) to be un enforceable, so also those entered into by women or the other persong specified above or entered into at night, or in the interior of the house or outside the town or village ( in a forest &c.) or with one's enemy or by persons unconnected with or unauthorized by the persons who are to be bound by them. 662 Manu (VIII. 165 and 168 ) also declares that all transactions (such as sale, mortgage, gift) brought about by force or fraud are

413 

null and void. Nār. IV, 26-42 treat this subject 663 exhaus, tively. Some of Narada's dicta are interesting. He says: ' in this world three are independent viz. the king, the Vedic teacher and the head of the house in his own house (32). Wives, sons and slaves are not independent; the head of the house has independent power as to what belongs to him by inheritance (34).' Kāt. (497) also prescribes that one should not give a loan to women, minors or slaves. When the texts say that women are incompetent to make contracts, what is meant is that they cannot make contracts binding on their husbands or family or against the family property. Women are not inherently in competent to deal with their own separate property except that the husband has some control ( these matters will be discussed at length later on under stridhana). Another proposition laid down by Yāj. II 23, Nār. IV. 97, Kāt. (517) and others 664 is that in all transactions relating to a debt or any other title of law the last act is the deciding factor ; but in the cases of gift, pledge or purchase each prior transaction (of gift &c. ) is of superior efficacy to the succeeding one. 665 

After the establishment of British rule in India during about 150 years numerous publications dealing with Hindu customs and usages and the Hindu law of debts, contracts, adoption, family rights, partition and inheritance have been published.

The idea of the liability to pay off one's debts was developed in India in the most ancient times. In Rg. VIII. 47. 17666 the poet exclaims' Let us drive away the evil effects of bad dreams as we pay off debts'. In Rg. X, 34, 10 ( the gambler's lament) it is stated that the gambler, because he owes a ( gambling ) debt, is afraid and approaches the houses of others at night, desiring wealth '. 667 This indicates that a debtor was afraid of being detained by his creditor in those days. Rg. VIII. 66. 10 indicates that money-lenders made a stipulation to receive double of what they lent, 'Indra strikes by his power all panis who make representations of taking double '. 668 The Ait. Br. 33. 1 (tnam-asmin san-nayati ) 669 employs the very verb * san-nayati' which occurs in Rg. VIII. 47. 17. The Atharvaveda VI. 117, 3 and Tai. Br.

world ( of pitss ) and the third world (the world of gods ). 670 The Tai. S. (III. 3. 8. 1-2 ) uses the very word 'kusida ', which occurs 671 in the Dharmasūtras and smrtis ( for money-lending) when it says, 'O Agnil whatever debt has not been paid back by me, the tribute that I owe to Yama, here do I make return of it; may I be freed from that debt 1. The Sat. Br. XIII. 4.3.11 associates kusidin with black magic in the Pāriplava. The Nirukta (VI. 32 ) while commenting on Rg. III. 53, 14 explains the word Pramaganda' occurring therein as 'one who is born of a family that is extremely usurious ', 672 Pāṇini employs the technical word ' uttamarpa'(creditor ) in his sūtra 'dhārer-uttamarpah' (I. 4. 35), he speaks of "adhamarnya' (the position of a debtor) in II. 3. 70 and the word "pratibhū' occurs in Papini II. 3. 39, the word 'vrddhi' (interest) in V. 1. 47. Pāpini (IV. 4.31) derives the words 'kusidika' and ' kusidikin.' It is noteworthy that Pāṇini does not derive or mention the word vārdhuṣika, which is employed by oven Ap. Dh. S, and Baud. Dh. S. and which is derived by Katyāyana ( the grammarian) in Vārtika 3 on Pāṇini IV. 4. 30, in which Papini refers to such words as 'dvaiguṇika' or 'traiguṇika'which were applied to people that carried on the condemned methods of money-lending viz. extorting twofold or threefold of the money lent ( the sūtra is 'prayacchati garhyam'). Brahmanaspati is spoken of as 'one who recovers a debt (rṇam-ādadih) in Rg. II. 24. 13 and the Adityas as those who, themselves being the observers of rta (the universal Law of Right), collect 673 debts' (Rg. II. 27. 4). In Rg. VIII. 32. 16 it is said that those priests who extract (and offer ) Soma juice do not indeed owo a dent (to the gods ). Divodāsa is said in Rg. VI. 61. 1 to have been the gift of Sarasvati to Vadhyrasva as a son to pay off debts ( macyutam ) 674. These passages certainly establish that in the remote ages of the

Rgveda it was a firm belief that men were under obligations to gods and pitrs, which could be fulfilled only by worship (yana ) and by the birth of a son. These passages oontain the germ of the dootrine of the three religious and spiritual debts that a man owed to gods, Manes ( pitys ) and sages, which he paid off by sacrifices, by the birth of a son and by vedio study ( vide Tai. S. VL. 3.10.5, Sat. Br. 1 7.2.11 and Alt. Br. 33. 1 quoted in H, of Dh, vol. II. pp.270, 560 notes 621 and 130% and above n. 669). Gradually further universal obligations came to be added to this theory of spiritual debts. The Adiparva (120. 17-20 ) holds that men owe four debts, viz the three vedic ones and the fourth to humanity in general ( which is paid back by goodness to all) and Anuśāsana 37. 17 raises them to five (adding brahmapas and guests to the well-known three ) 675. It appears to me that this theory of spiritual debts being already in the air, the same sanctity came gradually to be transferred to one's promises to repay monetary debts and carry out other secular engagements. The word rna had been applied both to spiritual and secular debts. It is on account of this that the son was not only desir ed for repaying the spiritual debt owed to one's ancestors, but he was also expected to free his father (if the father could not himself repay the monetary debt ) from the liability he incurred to his creditor. Nar. IV. 5-9 puts this clearly and most emphatically: "fathers desire to have song for their own benefit thinking in their heart he will release me from liability to creditors and debtors' (or probably 'from high or low debts' i. e. spiritual and earthly debts ). Three deceased ( ancestors ) must be honoured (by a man) and he must subsist on three ( descendants) that come after him. These ( the first three ) series of ancestors rely (for repayment) of their twofold debts ( spiritual and secular) on the fourth in descent. If a man fails to pay on demand a debt or promised gift, that sum (by the addition of interest) goes on growing till it amounts to a hundred crores and when a hundred orores are reached he is born again and again in the house of his creditor as a slave in order to repay the debt (by his labour).

without discharging his debts, the whole merit due to his austerities and the perpetual tending of fire belongs to his creditors". 676 Kat. (551, 591 ) expresses the same idea but adds that a debtor who has not repaid money borrowed may be born as a slave, & servant, a woman or a beast in the house of his creditor. It was this belief that led to the doctrine of the pious obligation of the son to pay off his father's debts even if he received no property from the father, 677 

Nārada IV. 98 defines "kusida' in a rather obscure verse as 'the receiving of money paid in consequence of the original ( amount advanced) and the profit ( agreed to be paid ) thereon and those are called kusidin who maintain themselves by this occupation'. Bphaspati ( S. B. E. 33 p. 320 verse 2) derives 678 kusida as 'that is called kusida, which is taken fourfold or ( even) eightfold without any qualm (by a person) from a wretched man who is sinking ( or distressed)'. Nār. IV. 110 defines vārdhuṣa as the interest (in kind) on grain, 678a but Ap. Dh. S. I. 6. 18. 22 and Baud. Dh. S. employ the word 

vārdhuṣika' and Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 27. 10 has a verse in which the word urddhi occurs. Vas. (II. 41-42=Baud. Dh. 8. 1.5.93-94) quotes

two verses :' a vārdhusika (asurer) is one who taking cheap grain lends it on condition of receiving a quantity of grain of high price and is condemned among the brahmavādins ( students of the veda). Brahmaṇa murder and usury were weighed in a balance; the murderer of a brābmana rose to the top while the usurer trombled'. Here usury of the type of the one described in Vas. II. 41 (and not all lending of money at interest) is condemned as a great sin, Gaut. XII. 26, Vas. II. 50, Kaut. III. 11, Manu VIII. 140-141 and others declare it righteous (dharmyā) moneylending when an 80th part is stipulated as the interest per month. 679 

Megasthenes (fragment XXVII B p.72) states: ' The Indiang neither put out money at usury nor know how to borrow;' but he is under soine misapprehension, for he again says (p. 73 ) 'one who is unable to recover a loan or deposit has no remedy at law. All the creditor can do is to blame himself for trusting a rogue'. 

Nār. IV. 1. states that the principal topics under the title of rṇādāna are seven: what debts must be paid and what not; by whom, where and in what manner ( they are to be paid ); and the rules about advancing the loan and receiving it back. The first five of these relate to the debtor and the last two to the creditor. Bphaspati (S. B. E. 33 p. 320 v. 4) says that interest (výddhi) is described to be of four kinds by some, of five kinds by others and of six kinds by still others. Nār, (IV. 102-104) names four kinds and defines them, viz. kārita (interest that is stipulated by the debtor himself ), kālikā (interest accruing and payable every month), kāyikā (interest of a pana or quarter pana to be paid every day without the principal being liable to be reduced, whatever interest may have been recovered), rakravrddhi ( interest on interest called compound interest). Manu VIII. 153 mentions these four and commentators thereon give varying interpretations. Bșhaspati (S. B. E, 33 p. 321 verse 6 ) and Vyāsa ( g, by Sm. C. II. p. 154) define kūyikā as interest received from the body i. e. milk received from a cow pledged or the work put in by a slave or by a bull pledged. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 321 verses 7-8)

adds two more varieties viz. dikhavṛddhi 680 (hair-like interest i. e. interest payable every day and so growing every day, just as the top-knot on one's head grows every day ) and bhogalabha (profit by enjoyment i. e, making use of a house or taking the produce of a field in lieu of Interest in the case of a mortgage ), Gaut. (XII. 31-32 ) mentions the six, but instead of bhogalābha he uses the word ' adhibhoga', which is defined by Kat. (501) as a transaction in which the completo enjoyment of the thing pledged or mortgaged is to be the interest. Kat. (498-500) defines karita, sikhavrddhi and bhogalabha. 

Br. (S. B. E 33 D. 319 yerse 1) stateg 681 that the creditor should always advance a loan after taking an adequate pledge or a deposit (with a mutual friend) or a reliable surety and after committing the transaction to writing or making the loan in the presence of witnesses. The interest may be either stipu lated (krta) at the time of the loan or not stipulated (alerta), as indicated in Visnu VI. 4. Yaj. II. 38 and Visnu Dh. S. VI. 3 state the general rule that debtors of all castes may pay to creditors of all castes the interest settled by mutual agreement and the rate of interest stipulated may be with reference to an

that double the interest stated above may be taken when there is nothing pledged to secure the debt. Yāj. and Vyāsa provide that this rate is the proper one when some thing is pledged or mortgaged by way of security. Yāj. II. 37, Manu VII. 14% (*Nār. IV. 100), Viṣnu Dh. S. VI. 2 provide an option that two, three, four or five per cent per month may be charged as inte rest in the order of the varnas 684 (i, e. 2 per cent per month for a brāhmaṇa debtor and so on). Yaj. II. 37 allows these rates only if there is nothing pledged by way of security. Vyāga 685 (in Par. M. III. p. 221) provided that the monthly rate of inte rest was ofth of the principal lent when a pledge or mortgage was given as against the loan, oth when only a surety was offered and two per cent per month when money was lent on personal security. The Anusaganaparva 117.20 condemns to Hell those who take exorbitant interest. Kaut. prescribed ( as stated in n. 688 ) fines for taking heavier interest than that allowed by him. Kat. (498) provides that if a debtor himself stipulates a higher rate of interest than is allowed by the śāstra in times of difficulty (in order to induce the creditor to part with his money ) that stipulated interest must be paid but a rate of interest imposed by the creditor otherwise ( by force &c.) should not be enforced by the Court. 686 It is probable that these rates are specified because of the economic conditions of those times which proved too much even for the ancient sages or different mercantile usages about interest prevailed in different countries at different times, as expressly stated by Nār. IV. 105-106 that 687 these high rates (including eight per cent per month ) had to be paid according to the law merchant in different countries. Manu VIII. 141 ( =Nār. IV. 100 ) holds that to take two per cent per month (on unsecured debts ) is not improper. In medieval times also the rate of interest was rather high e. g. interest at 25 per cent is said to have been

charged on a deposit of six gadyaras kept with the mahajanas of Sivapura ( vide Yewur Ing. in E. I. XII. p. 273). Yaj. II. 38 provides that those debtors who carry on trade by traversing dense forests and those who are sea-faring traders should respectively pay 10 per cent and 20 per cent per month and tbe Mit. adds that these exorbitant rates are allowed because of the great danger of the logs of even the principal as the debtors may perish by ship-wreck or from the attacks of robbers and wild beasts. Manu VIII. 157 leaves the rate of interest in the case of seafaring merchants to those who are clover in these matters and who know the proper time and place. Kaut. (III. 11 ) states 688 that the prescribed (dharmya) rate of interest is 14 paṇu per cent per month, but in transactions (or in commercial usage ) it is five panas per cent per month ( as the highest, it appears ), that those who traverse forests and those who carry on maritime trade should pay respectively ten and twenty per cent per month, that those who exceed or induce creditors to exceed these rates should be punished with the first amercement, that each of the witnesses to such usurious transact ions should be punished with half of the above fine. 

Other ruleg laid down in the smrtis relate to the maximum that can be recovered by a creditor from a debtor at one time. All are agreed that the creditor cannot recover at one time from the debtor for principal and interest more than double of the money lont. Vide Kaug. (III. 11), Manu VIII. 151, Gaut. XII. 28, Yāj. II. 39, Viṣnu Dh. VI. 11, Nār. IV, 107, Kāt. (509). This is called the rule of draigunya 689 in the smrtis and of dāndupat in modern times. It will be explained in detall a little below. As regards the interest in kind on articles lent there is some difference of opinion, which need not be gone into in great detail. Manu VIII, 151 and Gaut.

that in the case of cattle and female slaves wbon loaned their progeny is the profit, in the case of liquids (like oil and ghee) when loaned the maximum recoverable is eightfold and in the case of clothes and grain it is respectively four and three times. Vas. II. 44-47 says the maximum recoverable at one time in the case of grain, flowers, roots, fruits and fluids (like oil) is three-fold and eight-fold in the case of things that can be weighed. Vide Viṣnu Dh. $. VI. 12-15. Visnu VI 17 (anuktūnām dviguṇā) provides that where no special rule is laid down the maximum recoverable is to be only double of what is lent. Kāt. (570-572) states 690 that the maximum recoverable in the case of precious stones, pearls, corals, gold, silver, fruits, silk, wool is double of what is loaned; of oils, liquors, ghee, raw-sugar and salt and land eight-fold, of baser metals five-fold. Vide Bf. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 322 verses 13-16 ) and V. Nirnaya p. 229 ( quoting Bharadvāja) for similar provisions. 

The rule of what is called dāmdupu in modern times express od laconically by Manu VUL 151 and Gaut. XII. 28 is this that 'the amount of principal and interest recoverable at one time in a lump sum cannot be more than double of the money lent'. As a debt was recoverable not only from a man himself but also from his three descendants and as therefore there was practi cally no period of limitation for bringing a suit for money lent, creditors had great temptations to allow interest to go on increasing. Therefore the sages who condemned the profession of usury and particularly waiting long for the increase of interest 691 laid down that whatever the length of time during which the principal was at interest and whatever the rate of interest might have been, the creditor could recover by suit in a lump sum only double of the money lent. This acted as a great

cheok on the creditors' rapaoity. Several propositions are laid down in the Mit., 69 the Vyavabāramayukha and other digests that graft exceptions on the general rule, and that flow from the interpretation of Manu VIII, 151 in both readings. The first modification is that if interest is received every day, month or year and is not claimed in a lump sum at one time then the total interest received by a creditor may be even several times more than the principal lent. Br. provides (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 321 verse 11 ) that every day interest or bodily interest and bhogalābha may be taken by the creditor ( irrespective of the question of dvaigunya) as long as the principal is not paid 6%, (2) Further, if after the interest has accumulated for some time, there is a fresh agreement with the same debtor whereby the sum lent together with interest due is taken as the principal and interest is agreed to be paid on the amount so arrived at, then the total recoverable after this fresh agreement may exceed double the original sum lent. Manu (VIII, 154-155 ) and Br. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 331 verse 60 ) allow such a fresh agreement. But if the debtor does not make a fresh agreement then the rule of dāndupat would apply. (3) If after the sum due to the creditor has become double of the principal lent, the creditor accepts another man as the debtor ( who takes the liability on himself), then the creditor may recover from the substituted debtor after the lapse of years an amount which may be more than double of the sum originally lent. (4) If the debtor pays a part of the principal or if the creditor makes a concession (called 

reka' in the Mit. on Yāj. II. 39 ) and reduces the total recover able or if the debtor receives an additional amount of money ( called 'seku' in the Mit.) and it is added to the original amount borrowed and a fresh agreement is made between the parties to put the whole to interest, then the rule of dāmdupat would not apply.

Rule of dāmdupat 

425 

The rule of damdupat has been acted upon by the courts in India in modern times 64. Though under the Transfer of property Act before its amendment in 1929 there was a conflict of decisions, since 1929 it is settled that the rule of damdupat does not apply to mortgages governed by the Transfer of Property Act. But the rule is so reasonable and humane that the Deccan Agriculturists' Relief Act (XVII of 1879 ) has made (by sec. 13) the rule of dāmdupat applicable to all agriculturists as defined by the Act, whether Hindus or non-Hindus; and the Bombay Agricultural Debtors Relief Act (of 1939), sec. 42, the Madras Debt Conciliation Act (XI of 1936, sec, 16 ) do the same. 

A loan has to be returned on demand if no time is fixed for repayment or on the expiry of the time ( if one has been fixed by the parties ) or when interest ceases on account of becoming equal to the principal ( Bṛ. in 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328 verse 47 ) Interest stops when on the debtor offering to pay the loan the creditor refuses to accept it and the debtor deposits the money in the hands of a third person (Gaut. XII. 30, Yāj. II. 44). With Yāj. II. 44 section 84 of the Transfer of Property Act (IV. of 1882 ) may be compared. Vas. II. 49 states the remarkable rule that interest stops the moment the king dies and begins to run only after the coronation of the successor. 695 Nār. II. 39 

694. Vide Balkrishna v. Gopal I. L, R. 1 Bom. 73 (where it was held that the rule of dāmdupat should not be extended to apply to the amount recoverable in execution of the decree of a civil court), Nanchand v. Bapusaheb 1, L. R. 3 Bom. 131 (held that the rule of dāndupat does not apply when the defendant is a non-Hindu ), Gopal v. Gangaram I. L, R, 20 Bom. 721 F, B. (the rule is excluded from mortgages the terms of which necessitate the existence of an account between the mortgagor and the mort gagee in possession about the rents and profits ), Sundarabai v. Jayawant 1 Bom. LR, 551, 555 (rule applies between all Hindu debtors and creditors both in respect of simple as well as mortgage debts), Khimji v. Chunilal 21 Bom. L. R. 419 (by agreement interest which does not exceed the principal may be capitalized ). It is interesting to find that in ancient Egypt the legal maximum rate of interest was thirty per cent and it was forbidden to allow interest to increase beyond the double of the principal. Vide Wilkinson's * Maoners and Customs of the ancient Egyptians' (First Series). 1842, vol. II p. 50. Usury was condemned in ancient Egypt, among the Jews (vide Psalm XV. 5, Ezek. XVIII. 8 and 17, Lev. XXV. 36-37) and by the ancient smrtis (as more heinous than even the murder of a brāhmaṇa, H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 124 a. 269).

(S. B.E. vol. 33 p. 33) provides that no interest runs on the price of commodities, on wages, on a deposit, on a fine, on what has been idly promised ( to bards and the like) and on the stake won in gambling, unless there is a special or express agreement to pay interest. 696 Kāt. ( 508 ) has a similar verse, 697 but adds hides, crops, liquor, bride-price and suretyship debts to some of those mentioned by Nar. Kaut. (III. 11) provides that no interest runs where the debtor is a person engaged in a Vedic sacrifice of long duration, or is suffering from a disease or is staying at his teacher's house ( gurukula) for study or is a minor or is a man without any substance. As regards some cases where originally a thing is lent to a person out of friendship or because he asked a loan of it, Nar. (IV. 108) and Kat, (502-505) lay down certain rules which are quoted in the Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 38 ) and other works. Nār. (IV. 108 ) prescribes 698 that no interest ever attaches to things loaned through friendship, unless there is an express stipulation to that effect; but even in the absence of a stipulation interest starts running after the expiry of six months. Nar. IV. 109 and Kat. (505) both lay down that a loan (of money or an article) made through friend ship cannot begin to earn interest as long as no demand is made for its return. If the debtor refuses to return it after it is demanded interest begins to run at the rate of five per cent. Kāt. (502-504 ) 699 lays down three propositions about yācitaka (a temporary loan of money or of an article): (1) When a person takes such a loan and goes to another country without

returning it, that loan begins to acquire interest after a year from the date of the loan ( though no demand be made ); (2) if a person after taking a loan goes to another 700 country without returning it even when pressed by the lender to return it that loan begins to acquire interest three months (after demand); (3) when the borrower of a thing does not return it even though he is pressed to return it, the king should make him pay interest from that day (i. e. day of demand ), though it was not agreed upon, though he remained in the country and though he be unwilling to pay interest. The Madanaratna says that in these cases where no interest is settled beforehand and where the texts do not specify the rate (as Kāt. 505-506 do viz. what is lent through friendship, a deposit, balance of interest, unpaid purchase money, if not returned on demand, begin to carry interest at five per cent per month ), the rate of interest would be the one stated by Yāj. II. 37 (viz. 1/80th per month ) and Visnu VI. 4. (akstāmapi vatsarātikramena yathāvihitam ), 

Adhi701 means pledge of a movable or mortgage of im movable property. Nār. IV. 117 remarks 702 that in lending money an ādhi and surety are the two sources that inspire con fidence (in the creditor that his money will be safe ) and a document and witnesses are the two modes of proof that will establish (the existence of a debt). An ādhi is so called because the creditor is authorised to wield power over it or it is placed within his power (Nār. IV. 124 and Mit. on Yāj. II. 58)703. The

II. 38 and holds that these incidents are even now applicable to contracts of debts by Hindu debtors and that neither the Interest Act (XXXII of 1839) nor the ladian Contract Act affects the ancient Hindu Law. It should be noted that 31 Mad. 250 aad 53 Mad. 549 at p. 579 dissent from this view.

word adhi occurs in Ap. Dh. 8. I. 6. 18. 20704 (which includes among those who are unfit to be invited at a śrāddha 'one who subsists on adhi'). Gaut. XII. 29 also refers to adhi, Kaut. (IIL. 12 ) briefly deals with ādhi and after stating some rules extends the principles of upanidhi (deposit) and debt to it. Manu VIII. 165 employs the word 'adhamana' in the sense of' mortgage'. According to Br. 705 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 323 verse 17 ) an ādhi is of four kinds viz. of movable property, of immovable property, gopya (to be kept in custody of the pledgee only ), bhogya (to be enjoyed). Nār. IV, 124 first divides adbi into two sorts, viz. one that is to be redeemed within a certain time fixed (by agreement at the time of contracting the debt) or to be retained till the debt is paid off and Nār. IV. 125 again subdivides each of these two into gopya and bhogya. This latter division was known to Gaut. XII. 32 Manu VIII. 143, Yāj. II. 59, Kāt. (576). The subdivisions of adhi are made from several points of view viz. the nature of the property, the form of the pledge, the men tion or non-mention of a period and the evidence to establish it. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 58 explains 706 that the first kind of adhi mentioned in Nār. IV. 124 contains the conditions that the money will be repaid at a fixed time and that if the money be not so paid at the time fixed the thing pledged or mortgaged will belong to the creditor. Yāj. 'II. 58 sets out three provisions viz. (1) when a time is fixed for payment, the thing pledged or mortgaged is lost to the debtor if the time fixed is allowed to pass without there being any repayment ( whether it be an adhi that is to be merely kept or whether it is one to be enjoyed); (2) but if no time be fixed the thing given as security is not lost

to the debtor at all, when it is an adhi that is to be enjoyed; (3) if no time is fixed and the adhi is only to be kept (gopya) then it is lost to the debtor only if it is not redeemed even when the debt has grown to double of the principal by non-payment of the interest agreed upon. There is a period of fourteen days' grace after this, as stated by Bṛ. (8. B. E.707 vol. 33 p. 324, verses 27-28) that when the principal has been doubled or the stipulated period in the case of a pledge delivered for a certain time only has expired, the creditor becomes the owner of the pledge, after waiting for a fortnight during which the debtor may repay the debt and redeem his property. Gaut. XII. 29, Manu VIII. 143, Yāj. II. 58, Viṣnu Dh. S. VI. 5 provide that an adhi which is mortgaged with the condition that the fruit or profits are to be enjoyed bears no interest nor can the creditor, even after keeping such an ādhi for a long time, make a gift of it or sell it. Medhātithi on Manu VII. 143 holds that a mort gagee with possession who is to enjoy the produce cannot, by virtue of the last quarter of Manu VIII. 143, make a sub-mortgage (called anvādhi). Kullūka on 708 the other hand says that it is common practice in all countries for a mortgagee to execute a sub-mortgage of land and the like and that Manu VIII. 143 does not forbid it. Prajāpati 709 (q. by Par. M. III. p. 242) defines a deed of sub-mortgage: 'if the creditor pledges to another the thing already pledged to him for the same amount (for which it was pledged to him ) he should pass a fresh deed of pledge (or mortgage ) and should hand over the former deed to his own creditor.' It appears that sub-mortgages came to be recognized rather late. Bharadvaja states that if a sub-mortgage be effected without the mortgagor's consent, the mortgagee would lose his money.

..The general rule was that an adhi (whether of movable or immovable property ) that was bhogya carried no interest but the profits were to be taken in lieu of interest (vide Kāt. 516 ) 710 and the debtor would in this case get back his property on paying the principal. Kaut. (III. 12 ) states 711 that immovable property mortgaged may be such that it can be enjoyed only by expending labour over it or without expending one's own labour the creditor may enjoy the fruits or income thereof. But as noted by Vyāga and Bharadvāja 712 the stipulation about a bhogya ādhi may be that the income from the property is to be taken as in payment of the whole interest and part of the principal. This latter is called sapratyaya-bhogyadhi and the other variety where the income is taken in lieu of interest only is called apratyaya-bhogyādhi. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 64 after citing a text of Bphaspati refers to these two varieties (though it does not use these terms) and adds that if the income is not sufficient to meet the interest wholly then the debtor may have to pay the principal and the unpaid part of the debt before redeem ing his property. The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 64 ) states that the appropriate name 'kṣayādhi' is given by the people to what is called (above) as sapratyaya-bhogyādhi. Bharadvāja states that on taking an account ( where there is an agreement to apply the income towards interest and reduction of the principal) if the creditor has been overpaid he is to restore the overpaid amount to the debtor and that if a portion of the principal remains unpaid the debtor has to repay it. 

If a man first mortgaged his property and then sold it, the purchaser took it subject to the rights of the mortgagee (Vasistha quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 145). If a person executed a mortgage, a sale and a gift of the same thing on the same day, then the

donee would take one-third of the thing and the mortgagee and purchaser would share the remaining two-thirds in proportion to the money paid by each 713. If a person was liable to pay several debts, some secured by a pledge or mortgage and some taken on personal security, the latter were to be paid first and redemption of the mortgage was to be ordered afterwards, according to Bharadvāja (q. by Vy. Nir. p. 245 ). 

The restriction that more money should not be taken from the sub-mortgagee than what was advanced to the mortgagor was for the benefit of the latter. The Par, M. (III. p. 242) provides that a sub-mortgage can be made only when the amount due has risen to double the principal, but that if the owner consents a sub-mortgage may be made even before that con tingency arises. 

Kāt. (522) requires that an adhi becomes valid when such particulars as the boundaries of the field or house and the village ( in which it is situated) are specified 714 Kat::(518) further provides that a writing of pledge or sale or gift is superior to a similar transaction made in the presence of witnesses only. If the same field or other thing is mortgaged or pledged to two persons separately, Visnu Dh. S. V. 185 715 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 326 verse 34 ) prescribe n6 that the one who got possession first (without force ) is entitled to preference. This shows that under ancient Hindu Law possession was nine points of law and that hypothecation without delivery of possession was known to Kāt. and other smrti writers, even if earlier smrtis did not recognise an hypothecation without possession. Yāj. II. 60 and Nār. IV, 139 emphatically assert that a pledge or mortgage becomes perfect or effective only if there

is enjoyment and not otherwise. This is to be taken along with Yaj. IL 23 and so the first in time shall prevail only if the first is accompanied with possession. If a sale or mortgage be made before witnesses to one man and in writing to another, the latter prevails over the former 717. If a debtor were to pledge or mortgage the same thing to another after pledging it to one and without redeeming the first debt, Viṣnu Dh. 8. (V. 181-182) prescribed 718 the drastic measure of corporal punishment (whipping or imprisonment) if the land mortgaged was a gocurma or more in extent or a fine of 16 suvarnas if it was less. Kat. (517) in similar circumstances made the debtor liable to the fine imposed on a thief. Kat. (519-521 q. in Sm. C. II. pp. 144 145 and V. P. pp. 240-241 ) states that in a competition between a document of pledge which does not give particulars of the thing pledged or which refers to a thing not existing at the time and a document in which the thing pledged is described with partioulars or in which the thing existed at the time the deed was executed, the latter is entitled to preference; similarly the pledge of a thing specifically described is superior to a prior pledge of all the debtor's property mentioned in general terms. 

If an adhi deteriorates 719 in value (i. e, becomes inadequate to meet principal and interest) or if it be lost or destroyed though proper care be taken thereof by the creditor, then the debtor must either pledge another adequate thing (in substitu tion) or the debtor should return the amount due (Yaj. II. 60, Kat. 524). The Mit. on Yāj. II. 60 remarks that it follows from this that it is the duty of the pledgee to take proper care of the thing pledged. Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 323 verse 19 ) expressly says

Care required of a pledgee

that the pledge has to be kept carefully like a deposit, as other wise interest is forfeited in case of its being damaged. If a pledge which is to be kept only is enjoyed by the creditor, then the interest stops and if it deteriorates or is lost the creditor has to restore it to its former condition or substitute another of equal value; if a pledge to be enjoyed is lost or deteriorates by use then also the interest stops; and the creditor has to restore it, otherwise he will lose his principal (Yāj. II. 59 and the Mit. thereon, Nār. IV. 125, 127). If a pledge is lost without any fault or negligence of the creditor, but through fate (i. e. accidents like fire or flood) or the action of the king, the debtor has to furnish another pledge or to pay the amount due(Kāt. 523, Nār. IV.126, 130, Yaj. II.-59, Vispu Dh. S. VI. 6, Gaut. XII. 39, Br., S. B. E. 33 p. 323 verse 21). From the time of Gautama 720 (about 500 B. C.) onwards the rule about the care required of a pledgee, bailee, depositee was the same viz. that he is to take of another's property kept with him as much care as he would take of his own. Nār. (niksepa 14) and Yāj. II. 67 lay down the same rule for all kinds of bailments. Manu VIII. 189 ( =Nār., nikṣepa, Verse 12) illustrates what is meant by accidental loss. 

The debtor cannot redeem the pledge or mortgage before the time fixed by mutual agreement, but by mutual agreement he can redeem even before (Bṛ. S. B. E. P. 325 verses 32-33). If the creditor does not allow redemption when the debtor has a right to redeem and is ready to do so, the creditor may be liable to be fined as a thief (Yāj. II. 62). Acc. to Kaut. (III, 12) the fine is 12 panas721. 

It has already been stated above (p.429) that in certain cases (i.e. when it is a gopya ādhi) the ownership is lost to the mortgagor (i. e, in the language of modern law there is a foreclosure), if the amount has risen to double of the money lent without payment (even after the period of grace) or if the period fixed has passed away without there being repayment (whether the

amount has risen to double of that lent or not, aoo. to Mit. on Yaj. II.58). But if at the time of contracting the debt the stipulation is to repay the sum lent with interest and there is no stipulation about loss of the ownership of the thing mortgaged (1. e. it is like a simple mortgage of modern times), then there is no loss of ownership. There is then only a power of sale in the mortgagee, So also in the case of a bhogyādhi the mortgagor or bis heirs can redeem the property at any time by paying the principal and there is no loss of ownership to the mortgagor. According to Yaj. II. 63 and Br. 722 (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 325 verse 29) the creditor can sell in the presence of (the debtor's relatives) and witnesses the adhi, when the amount has grown to double of that lent or when the period fixed has passed, if the debtor has not redeemed and is absent or dead. After 

meeting his own dues the creditor has, as said by Kat. 529, to hand over the balance of the sale price to the king (i, e. pro bably to the court of the locality). Kaut.723 (III. 12) provides that if the debtor is present and the creditor is afraid of the loss of his money because it may exceed the market value of the ādhi he may sell it with the permission of the judges (dharmastha) or he may demand a surety for assurance. It appears from these passages that a sale through court and a right of private sale were both recognised in the case of mort gages in ancient India (as in modern times under sections 65 and 69 of the Transfer of Property Act). 

There were two other special kinds of adhi described in Yaj. II. 61 viz. caritrabandhaka 724 and satyankāra. The first

occurs either when the creditor being known to be very honest the debtor gives as security a property of very great value for a small debt or where a debtor being known to be very honest & property of very small value is accepted as security for a large debt. In such a case there is no forfeiture or foreclosure of the property in any case but the king (or judge ) should award only double the principal lent. Another meaning is that in a caritrabandhaka it is the merit (apūrva or punya) arising from bathing in the Ganges or from performance of agnihotra that is given as security (i. e. he will forfeit merit on non payment). In this case the creditor will receive double and there is no loss or forfeiture of adhi. A pledge made with satyankāra occurs when at the time of making a pledge the stipulation is 'I am liable to pay only double but there will be no loss of the thing pledged' or (a second meaning of) satyan kāra is that when an earnest (a ring or the like) is given at the time of a sale and the vendor breaks the promise he has to pay double of the earnest'. 

If the mortgagee is dead or absent abroad, and the debtor wants to redeem he may take back the ādhi after paying the amount due to the family i. e. to his sons and other agnatic relations or to his cognates and in the absence of these (if the creditor be a brāhmaṇa) to other brāhmaṇas (and if no brāh manas be available) he may cast the money into water ( Yāj. II. 62 and Nār. IV. 112-113). The Kausika-sūtra 725 ( 46. 36-40) contains provisions about casting the debt in the cemetery or where four roads meet if the creditor is dead and there are no heirs. The Sangraha says that it may be thrown into water with a palāśa leaf to the accompaniment of Tai. S. III. 3. 4. 1-% quoted above (n. 671). Another alternative is that the debtor may have a valuation of the ādhi made at the time when he wants to redeem (and the creditor is absent), and allow it to remain with the creditor but without interest (and redeem it at the valua tion when the creditor comes or secure the price from the creditor if the ādhi be afterwards lost or destroyed, acc. to Mit. on Yāj. II. 63). 

Pratibha. A pratibhū or lagnaka (Bp. quoted in n. 681 and Kāt. 530) means 'surety'. Pratibhavya (boing a surety) was known to Gautama (XII. 38) and pratibhū was known to Panini

( II. 3. 39). Suretyship requires the concurrence of three persons viz. the creditor, the borrower (called the principal debtor) and the person who agrees, for inspiring confidence in the creditor 72, to pay or indemnify if the principal debtor commits default. Manu VIII. 160 speaks of surety for appearance and for repay ment of debt. According to the purpose of the transaction a surety is of three kinds (Yāj. II. 53 =Viṣṇu Dh. S. VI. 41 and Nār. IV. 118) viz. for appearance, for payment and for honesty. The first undertakes to produce a person before a court and assures the court that the person concerned will not abscond from the country; the surety for payment agrees that in case the debtor does not pay the principal and interest, he will him self pay both; the surety for honesty assures the employer or other person with whom another man deals that the latter is an honest and good man, that he would not deceive and that re liance may be placed on him (vide Mit. on Yāj. II. 53 and Sm. C. II. p. 148 for these explanations). Br. (S. B. E. 727 vol. 33 p. 327 verses 39-40) speaks of four (including the three of Yāj. II. 53), his fourth being one who promises to deliver or restore the assets that are with the debtor (such as household furniture or ornaments). Yāj. and Nār, must be deemed to include this last under the surety for payment. Kāt. (530) 728 says that a surety (lagnaka) may be caused to be given for repayment (of a debt), for appearance (upasthāna), in lawsuits, for honesty and for taking oaths (or ordeals). Acc. to Harita a surety is taken for five purposes viz. for keeping the peace (abhaya),

Different kinds of sureties 

437 

for honesty, for repayment of debt, for delivering the debtor's property to the creditor, for appearance. V. P. P. 248 quotes Vyāsa (who mentions seven kinds of sureties) and remarks that all can ultimately be reduced to three varieties. 

If the surety for appearance cannot produce the person at the time and place agreed upon, he should in that case pay to the creditor what he has bound himself to pay except where the debtor is prevented from appearing by act of God or of the king. But a period of a fortnight, a month or three fortnights at the most should be allowed to the surety to find out the absconding person 729. If he can produce him within that time the surety would be free from liability (Kāt. 531, 532, Bṛ, in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 327 verse 42). If the surety for appearance cannot (even after time is given) produce the debtor or the debtor dies then the surety has to pay from his own pocket the money due from the debtor (Manu VIII. 158 and Kāt. 532-33). All this is subject to the proviso of the act of God or of the king. 

Sureties of all kinds are personally liable to make good the loss arising from the non-appearance of the debtor, or from his dishonesty or non-payment (Yāj. II. 53, Viṣnu VI. 41, Bp, in S, B. E. 33 p. 327 v. 41); but the sons of the surety for appea rance or honesty were not liable, if the surety died 730. Yet if the surety for appearance or honesty stood surety only after taking some security from the debtor for so doing, then even the son would be liable to reimburse from such security the person losing. The liability of sons and grandsons for the suretyship debt of the father or grandfather will be discussed a little later on. If there are several sureties, then each will have to pay a proportionate part of the debt; but if each of the sureties has undertaken the whole liability of the debtor (i. e. if the liability of all is joint and several) then the creditor may at his will recover the whole debt from any one of the several sureties

History of Dharmatõstra 

(Vol. 

(Yaj. II. 55, Nār. IV. 120). Kāt. 538 states 731 a special rule that whichever out of several sureties that have incurred joint and several liability is found present at the place (of the agreement) should be made to pay the debt; if such a surety has gone abroad his son may be made to pay the whole, but if the surety be dead the son should be made to pay only the share of his father (there being several sureties). If a surety being pressed or harassed by a creditor pays openly (before all people) the debt (wholly or in part) 732 then the debtor will be made to pay after three fortnights double of what the surety has to pay (Yaj. II. 56, Nār. IV. 121, Viṣgu Dh. S. VI. 44, Kāt. 539). But if the surety pays without being pressed he would get only what he paid and if the debtor reimburses the surety without loss of time then he has not to pay double. These rules apply to mooey lent; but in the case of grain, clothes and liquids the debtor must pay to the surety three, four or eight times respec tively ( Yāj. II. 57). Who could not be accepted as sureties has already been stated (on pp. 291-292 ). 

Several were the modes of the recovery of debts. Manu (VIII. 47-48 ) requires the king to make the debtor repay his debt to the creditor in whatever way he can do it. There is a difference in the modes of recovery according as the liability is admitted by the debtor or not. If liability is denied then the only method is to file a suit for the recovery of the debt. But if the liability is admitted by the debtor, then Manu VIII. 49 (Nār. IV. 122), and Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 329 v. 54) mention five means of recovery viz. dharma (persuasion), vavahāra (legal proceed ing), chala or upadhi (trick), carita ( sitting down at his door ), or bala (compulsion to do work or confinement). It appears from Ap. Dh. S. (I. 6. 19. 1) that the method of sitting at the door for recovery of debts was known to Ap. (the creditor so doing is designated pratyupaviṣta ). In a Marwad Inscription

Modes of the recovery of debts 

439 

dated samuat 1198 (1141-42 A. D.) this practice is called kaya-orata (yadi brāhmaṇaḥ kāyavratam kętrā mriyate). Vide E. I vol. XI. p. 37 at p. 40. These modes of recovery except vyavahāra are explained by Bșhaspati as follows:733 The method of dharma consists in sending messages (to the debtor ) from his friends and rela tives, in persuading him to pay with sweet worde, by following the debtor (i.e. by persistent dunning) and by frequent requests. Trick consists in the creditor borrowing from the debtor some ornament or other article under the pretext of its being required in a festival and not returning it or in retaining what the debtor has handed over to the creditor for being delivered to another; that is compulsion when the debtor is brought to the creditor's house, is then confined or beaten and thus induced to repay the debt; that is ācarita where the creditor keeps tied his own wife or son or cattle at the debtor's house or sits down at his door (fasting). All these methods could not be employed in the case of all debtors. Kat. (477-480) has already been cited (on p. 383) to show how the king is to employ the various methods in the case of brāhmaṇas, traders &c. If the creditor employs any one of the methods (other than vyavahāra ) and harasses a debtor when the latter claims judicial investigation and there is a doubt or dispute between the two as to the amount, the rate of interest, the liability to pay, the creditor would lose his claim and would have to pay a fine equal (to the claim )734. Kat. 589 and Br.735 (S. B. E. vol. 33, p. 331 verses 63-65) lay this down. But when the debtor admits his liability and yet does not pay and when the creditor therefore employs one of the means (other than a suit) appropriate to the caste and position of the debtor, then, if the debtor complains to the king

against the creditor, the debtor would be compelled by the king to pay the debt and a fine for unnecessary complaint ( Yāj. II. 40, Manu VIII, 176, Visṇu Dh. S. VI 19 ). Kāt. (580-584 ) provides that where 736 it is the custom of the country, the creditor may hold the debtor in restraint openly before an assembly of people until he pays what is due, that when a man 80 restrained has an inclination to answer calls of nature, he should be followed behind by the creditor or he should be allowed to go alone but fettered, that he should be allowed to go home for his meals and at night if he furnishes a surety, and that the surety will have to remain in restraint ( while the debtor is absent ), that if the debtor cannot secure a surety or does not accept the proposal of furnishing one he should be confined in jail or should be kept guarded by men; but that a respectable man who is trust-worthy and pure in conduct should not be put in jail, that he should be allowed to go without fetters or after being bound by an oath. Manu VIII. 177, Yāj. II. 43, Nar. IV. 131 lay down that if a debtor is unable to pay a debt then he should be made to do work suitable to his caste in the house of his creditor of the same or higher caste in order to gradually liquidate the debt (but without detriment to his own family) and a brāhmaṇa debtor should be made to pay by easy instalments 737.

Rules for the recovery of debts 

441 

husband's debt, but wives of cowherds and those who take a lease of lands for half produce may be arrested for non-payment by the husband. As compared with the harsh legislation against debtors in most ancient and medieval systems of jurisprudence the rules laid down by the smstis are very mild and humane 739. If there were several creditors there was priority among them i.e. the earlier debt prevailed over the later one; a brāhmana creditor however ( whatever the date of his advance) was preferred to a ksatriya or other creditor (Yaj. II, 41, Kāt. 514). Kaut 740 states that the debts owed to the Crown and a śrotriya take precedence over other debts and that unless the debtor is going to abscond several creditors should not simultaneously proceed against one debtor. Section 56 of the Bombay Land Revenue Code makes Government assessment a paramount charge on the land. But aoc. to Kāt. (513) if several debts were contracted in writing on the same date, they should all be treated as equal and paid off pro rata from the debtor's assets if insufficient; but, if a creditor established that a particular article belonging to a debtor was manufactured by the debtor with his money only, that creditor alone got the money recovered by sale of the article ( Kāt. 515 ). Bharadvaja states 741 that if a debtor has no cash then the creditor should be paid by sale of the debtor's other property in order viz. grain, gold, iron, cattle, clothes, land, slaves, and conveyances, ( in the absence of fields ) his garden and lastly his house and in the absence of even a house time should be granted to debtors of the three higher castes, 

739. Under the law of the Twelve Tables in Rome a creditor could put the debtor to death or sell him to a stranger beyond the Tiber or, if there were several creditors, they could divide the body of the debtor among them. selves after the third market day (Table III in Ortolan's Roman Law p. 106). Vide Sen's 'Hindu Jurisprudence' pp. 316-17 for later Roman and Irish rules.

When a debtor was not able to return the entire debt in a lump, he should write on the back of the document of debt the sums paid by him from time to time or the creditor may pass & receipt (upagata or praveśapatra, as the Mit. designates it) to the debtor signed by himself (Yaj. II. 93, Nār. IV. 114, Viṣnu Dh. S. VI. 26). If the creditor, though requested by the debtor, would not pass a receipt he was to lose the balance of his debt (Nar. IV, 114). Nār. IV. 115 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 332 verse 66 ) further provide that if the creditor does not write down (either on the bond itself or in a separate document) the money recovered by dharma or some other method then the debtor himself will be entitled to interest on the amount paid by him. 741When the whole debt is paid off, the creditor should tear off the bond of debt or he may execute another document in order to show that the debtor is freed from the debt (if the original is lost or is not within easy reach) and when a debt is borrowed in the presence of witnesses, it should be re turned in the presence of the same or other witnesses (Y&j. II. 94, Viṣṇu Dh. S. VI. 24-25). Nar. IV. 116 requires the creditor to return the document when the whole debt is paid off or to announce openly to others that it has been paid 742. 

It has now to be seen who (other the man himself) are liable to pay a man's debt. The liability to pay another's debt may arise on three grounds, (1) religious, (2) equitable and nioral, (3) legal, such as agency (express or implied) or authority. That the song and grandsons of the original debtor are liable to pay on religious grounds the debt of the father is expressly stated by numerous writers such as Kaut. 743 III. 11, Yāi. II. 50, Nar, IV. 4, Bṛ. (s. B. E, vol. 33 p. 328 verse 49 ), Kāt. (560), Vṛddha-Hārīta VI. 250-51, Viṣnu Dh. S. VI. 27.

Great-grandson's liability for debts 

443 

The important question is whether the smrtis declare the liabi. lity of the great-grandson. It is clear that smptis like that of Bṛ. expressly say that the great-grandson is not liable to pay his great-grandfather's debt. The Viṣṇu Dh. S. VI. 28 says that the descendants beyond the grandson need not pay if they are unwilling to pay. Others like Nar. IV, 4 and Kat, say that the obligation to return a debt ceases from the fourth. The question is what is meant by the fourth i. e. is it meant to exclude, in calculating, the original debtor or to include him? It is possible to hold (particularly because the great-grandson is not expressly mentioned in most emṛtis) that the fourth means 'inclusive of the original debtor'. But this appears to be in conflict with the rule in Manu IX. 137 (which is the same as Baud. Dh, S. II. 9. 6, Vas. 17. 5, Visnu Dh. S. 15. 46 ) that the son, grandson, and great-grandson confer the greatest spiritual benefit on the ancestor, the rule (Manu IX. 186, Nār. IV. 6) that pindas (in srāddha) are to be offered by three persons in descent and the general rule that whoever takes the inheritance must offer the pinda and pay the debts of the ancestor (Gaut. XII. 37, Yāj. II. 51, Nār. IV. 23, Visnu Dh. S. XV. 40 and VI. 29). Therefore, following the canons, viz. the rights to property aro co-extensive with the liability to perform sraddha and to pay off debts (which is quite logical and reasonable), that the texts relating to the same subject matter must be harmonized and reconciled as far as it is reasonably possible 744 to do (ekavākyatā-nyāya), that apparently conflicting texts are to be assigned their appropriate spheres (viṣayavyavastha), and that a direct conflict (and so an option) is to be presumed only if no other recourse is open, the Mitākṣarā and other commentators put forward the interpretation that the texts stating that the great-grandson is not liable to pay the great-grandfather's debt apply only to cases where the great-grandson inherits no ances tral property, but that he is liable if he takes ancestral property. Dr. Jolly in his note on Nār. IV. 6 (in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 44) remarks:"the doctrine, viz. the liability to pay debts contracted

by an ancestor extends to the great-grandson, is opposed to the teaching of such an eminent authority as Vijñānesvara, who maintains in the Mitākgard that the great-grandson 745 is not liable for debts contracted by his great-grandfather, and conversely that he does not inherit his property. He makes similar remarks in his Tagore Law Lectures for 1885 (on 'adoption, partition' &c. p. 171). Dr. Jolly is under some misapprehension since the Mit, in two places deals with this matter and expressly states that the great-grandson is liable to pay debts contracted by his great-grandfather if he has taken ancestral estate but not other wise. The following propositions are deducible from the smrti texts and authoritative commentaries like the Mit. and the Viramitrodaya (Vyavabāraprakāśa). The 746 first proposition is that the debts of a man must be paid by his three descendants (son, grandson and great-grandson) if they have ancestral estate in their hands (Mit. on Yāj. II. 51 quoted in note 745, Sm. C. II p. 171, V. P. p. 264). The 2nd proposition is that even when no ancestral estate was taken by the descendants the son was liable to pay his father's debts with interest, the grandson was liable to pay his grandfather's debt but without interest and the great-grandson was not liable to pay even the principal, if he was unwilling to pay. This proposition is enunciated by Viṣṇu Dh. S. VL 27-28, Bṛ.(S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328

Liability of sons and other descendants

V. 49 referred to on p. 443) and Kat. 556 747. In Narasimharav v. Antaji 2 Bom. H. C.R. 61 it was held ( probably following Bṛhas pati, though not quoted in the judgment) that the grandson was liable to pay the debt of his grandfather without interest even if there was no ancestral estate. This was felt to be a great hardship on heirs (taking no ancestral estate) and in order to remove it Bombay Act VII of 1866 (the Hindu Heirs' Relief Act) was passed whereby it is provided that a son or grandson is not liable to be sued for the debts of his deceased ancestor merely by reason of his being such a son or grandson and that the son, grandson or other heir shall be liable only to the extent of the assets that come to his hands. The game is the law laid down in other parts of India by judicial decisions. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 328 verse 48 ) recommends that the father's debt must be paid first of all and after that one's own debt; but a debt of the grandfather must always be paid even before the prece ding 748 two kinds of debt. These two propositions of Hindu jurists are very lucidly, but succinctly, set forth by the Vira mitrodaya quoted below 749. The third proposition (which is an exception to the above two) is that even a son is not liable to pay certain illegal and immoral debts of his father. This pro position will be discussed a little further on. A fourth proposi tion is that even when the father is not dead, the son, grandson or great-grandson may be liable to pay the father's or other ancestor's debt under certain circumstances. Yāj. II. 50 pro vides that sons (and grandsons ) must pay the debt of the father when he is dead or has gone to a distant country or is afflicted with an incurable disease.

[Vol. 

548-550 state that when the father, though living and near, becomes an ascetic (acc.to Visnu), is afflicted with such diseases or calamities as blindness from birth or loss of caste ( due to grave sins), lunacy, tuberculosis, leprosy and other (incurable) diseases or when he has left his country or has gone on a long journey or is very old (above 80) the son will have to pay the debt of the father after the twentieth year (from his going abroad). Acc. to V. R. (p. 50) if the father's disease was incu rable or if it was certain that he would not return from his journey then the son was bound to pay at once and was not entitled to wait for 20 years. Kat. (552-553) introduces 751_a further restriction that even when the father is dead, if the son has not attained years of discretion (i.e. if he is a minor) he need not pay the debt of his father during his minority; but when the proper time to pay arrives he must pay the debt; otherwise the (ancestors) may remain in hell. Thus the son's liability during the father's lifetime or absence was not abso lute but limited according to the smrtis and digests; judicial decisions, however, have brushed all this aside and the son's liability to pay his father's debts during the latter's lifetime is now as absolute as after his death. This will be discussed further on. 

According to all smrti writers even the son, though he may have taken the ancestral estate, is not liable to pay certain debts of the father which are compendiously described as * illegal or immoral' in the decisions of courts. Gaut. 752 XII.

What debts need not be paid by sons 

38, Kaut. III. 16, Manu VIII. 159-160, Vas. 16. 31, Yaj. II. 47 and 54, Nār. IV. 10, Bp. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 329 verge 51), Kāt. (564-565), Uśanas and Vyāsa provide that the son is not bound to pay the following debts of his father viz. those incurred as a surety (for honesty or appearance), for drinking or in gamb ling, those arising from idle promises (to bards, wrestlers and the like), debts for promises made under the influence of wrath or illicit love to women, the balance of a fine or toll and those that are not vyāvahārika. A debt arising from wrath is explai ned by Kāt, as one where the father causes physical injury to another or destroys another's property through anger and then promises something to pacify the person wronged. As regards the suretyship debts of the father, Yaj. II. 54, Vyāsa and Kāt. (561) provide that when the father was a surety for payment, then the son was bound to pay the principal of the debt for which the father stood surety, but the son of the son was not liable at all to pay the suretyship debt of his grandfather even when the latter was a surety for payment 753. These verses about the debts which the son was not bound to pay have been quoted and explained in numerous decisions of the courts. But as this work does not profess to be a treatise on modern Hindu Law those cases are passed over here. What is meant by * debts that are not vyāvahārika' has presented the greatest difficulty to the medieval commentaries and digests and also to modern courts as noted below 754.

where the father became a surety for appearance (or honesty ) after receiving a pledge from the person whose gurety he became, then the son of the surety may be made to pay the money due from that pledge in case the father is dead or has gono abroad 755 

The case law on the subject of the father's debts and the son's liability to pay them has assumed enormous proportions. This is not the place to discuss the case-law. But as the courts in India profess to follow the Hindu Law of the sages and medieval digests, it is necessary to examine some of the principles laid down by the latest decision of the Privy Council. In Brij Narain v. Mangla Prasad 51 I. A. 129 (=46 All. 95) the following five propositions are laid down by the Privy Council ( at p. 139): (1) the managing member of a joint undivided estate cannot alienate or burden the estate qua manager except for purposes of necessity ; (2) if he is the father and the other members are the sons, he may, by incurring debt, so long as it is not for an immoral purpose, lay the estate open to be taken in execution proceeding upon a decree for payment of that debt; (3) if he purports to burden the estate by mortgage then, unless that mortgage is to discharge an antecedent debt, it would not bind the estate; (4) antecedent debt means antecedent in fact as well as in time, that is to say, that the debt must be truly independent and not part of the transaction impeached; (5) there is no rule that this result is affected by the question whether the father, who contracted the debt or burdened the estate, is alive or dead.

In Kottapalli v, Kanuparti 58 Mad. 375, where the father executed a surety bond that a certain judgment debtor would file an insolvency petition within a specified period and the debtor failed to do so, it was held that the guarantee was one for confidence or bonesty and that the sons were not liable on the father's death. Similarly in Dhir Narain v. Shiva Sahay A, I, R, 1935 Pataa 127 it was held that song are not liable under Hindu Law where the father atood surety for appearance only.. Io Narayan v. Venkatacharya 6 Bom. L.

Divergence of modern decisions from smītis 

449 

is necessary to see how far these principles agree with or deviate from the law of the smrtis and the digests. The first proposition is in consonance with the law of the smrtis and of the commentaries like the Mit. Yāj. II. 45 provides 756 that whatever debt is contracted by the head of the joint family for the necessities of the family has to be paid by the members who take the ancestral estate when the head is dead or goes to a foreign country. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 114 quotes and explains & smrti text "Even one (the head or manager of a joint family) can make a mortgage, sale or gift of immovable property in a time of distress, for the necessities of the family and particular ly for religious and charitable purposes". What is meant by * debts in times of distress' and 'kuṭumbārthe' is explained by Kāt. (542-43 ) quoted in n. 756. This has been the foundation of numerous cases, the first and the most important of which is that of Hunoomanpersaud v. Mussumat Babooee 757 6 Moore's Indian Appeals p. 393 (P. C.). The 2nd proposition laid down

The actual pressure on the estate, the danger to be averted or the benefit to be conferred upon it in the particular instance, is the thing to be regarded.... They think that if the leader does inquire and acts bonestly, the real existence of an alleged sufficient and reasonably credited necessity is not a condition precedent to the validity of his charge and they do not think that under such circun stances, he is bound to see to the application of the money. The words 

the actual pressure, the benefit to be conferred' and the remarks about inquiry by the lender are a prolific source of litigation and have given rise to a mass of case-law. In L. R. 51 1. A. 129 at p. 137 the Privy Council them selves say that the distinction" made between secured and vosecured debts of the father is anomalous. They give an instance. 'A father who is manager borrows a like sum from A and B. TO A he gives a mortgage on the family estate containing a personal covenant. To B he gives a simple acknowledgment of loan. B sues and gets a decree; on this decree execution can follow and the estate can be taken. A, suing on his mortgage, cannot recover. (because the debt was not antecedent).

above also follows from several smrtis (such as Yaj. IL. 50, Visnu Dh. 8. VI. 35, Nār. IV. %, 4, 6) and the rules about immoral debts cited above. But it is difficult to understand why the Privy Council make a distinotion between a simple personal money debt of the father and a debt secured by a mortgage ( as in propositions % and 3). The ancient texts and commentaries make no such distinction. Vide 42 Mad. 711 at p. 731, 26 Bom. 206 at pp. 217-219 (F. B.) and 60 Bom, 311 (F. B.) where this is pointed out. With the greatest respect it must be said that the distinction is not only without dharmaśāstra authority, but is also anomalous. The distinction between 'antecedent debt' and a debt contracted at the time of execut ing a mortgage is unknown to the emptis or digests. The Privy Council had used for the first time in a very early case (viz. Suraj Bunsi v. Sheo Proshad 61. A. 88 at p. 106 = 5 Cal. 148, 171 ) the words 'antecedent debt '758 for which there is nothing corresponding in the Sanskrit authorities and round which elaborate arguments came to be centred in numerous later cases. According to the Privy Council (proposition 5) the son's pious duty to pay his father's debt is as absolute during the father's lifetime as after his death. It has been shown above that the duty was not absolute but qualified and limited during the father's life according to the smartis. 

Yaj. II. 5%, Kaut. (IIL 11 ) provide 759 that husband and wife; father and son and brothers cannot, as long as they are undivided, stand sureties for each other or be debtors and creditors of each other or be witnesses for each other. The Mit. has a long note on Yāj. II. 52. It shows that a wife may be divided us to estate from the husband if the latter desires (as laid down in Yaj. II. 114) and that in that case there may be the relation of debtor and creditor between them. 

758. The proposition laid dowa in 6 1. A. at p. 106 is 'where joint ancestral property has passed out of a joint family, either under a con veyanco executed by a father in consideration of an antecedent debt or in order to raise money for an antecedent debt or under a sale in execution of & decroo for the father's debt, his sons, by reason of their duty to pay their fatber's debts, cannot recover that property, unless thoy show that the debts were contracted for immoral purposes and that the purchasers had notice that they were so contracted'.

The wife's liability for husband's debts

The Mit. further explains the sūtras of Apastamba 760 (Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 16-19) which lay down there can be no division between husband and wife, for since the day of marriage they have to perform religious rites together, they also participate together in the rewards of merit arising from religious rites and also in the wealth acquired; for this reason when the husband has gone abroad if the wife spends on necessary occasions ( out of the family wealth) it is not declared to be theft'. The Mit. explains that the absence of division between husband and wife is restricted to religious rites performed with $rauta fires or smārta fire and in the rewards of meritorious acts and not in all actions or as to all property. Therefore in other charities where no sacred fire is required (purta acts such as constructing a well or a public park ) they have separate rights. Vide S. V. pp. 353 for various explanations of Bharuchi and others on Ap. Dh. S. and V. P. pp. 255-56. 

The father is not bound to pay his son's personal debt; the husband is not liable to pay the wife's debt, nor the wife her husband's or son's. But in all these cases if the debt is incurred for the benefit or purposes of the family by the son, the wife or the husband then the father, husband or wife respectively would be liable (Yaj. II. 47, Nār. IV. 10–11, Kāt. 545, 579) 761 If the father promised to pay his son's individual debt or if he appro ved or acquiesced in it he was liable to pay it. Manu VIII. 167, Yaj. II. 45, Nār. IV. 12, Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 329 v. 50), Kāt. (545) provide that a debt incurred for the purposes of the family by any one such as the son, brother, uncle, the wife, the mother, the pupil or a servant or a slave even without the consent of the head of the family when he has gone abroad, should be paid by the head of the family. This liability and the liability when the manager of a family contracts a debt for the benefit or neces sities of the family arise from agency (implied) or authority, Kaut. ( II. 11 ) holds that the husband may be seized (for work)

The general rule that the husband was not liable to pay the wife's debt had an exception viz, the husband was liable for the debts of the wife in the case of cowherds, vintners, actors, washermen and hunters (and the like) whose income depends on their wives and whose household expenses are defrayed by their wives (Yaj. II. 48, Visnu Dh. S. VI. 37, Nar. IV. 19). Similarly the rule that the wife was not liable for the husband's debt had certain exceptions, viz. a debt of the husband which she promised to pay because he was dying or going abroad or which was contracted jointly with her husband 763 ( Yāj. II. 49, Nār. IV. 16-17). The Mit. on Yaj. II. 49 answers the objection raised by some that, as according to Manu VIII. 416 ( = Udyogaparva 33.64) the wife, son and slave are without property and whatever they earn is acquired for him to whom they belong, the wife would not be able to pay anything at all. The reply is that this verse of Manu does not mean that a wife or son can own no property at all, but all that it declares is that they have no independent power to dispose of their property. 

The order in which persons are liable to pay a man's debts after his death is declared by Yay. II. 51, Nar. IV. 23, Br. (S.B.E. vol. 33 p. 329 verse 52), Kat. (562, 577), Visnu76 VI. 29-30.

Liability for the debts of the deceased 

453 

Whoever takes the wealth of the deceased ( whether a son or a collateral heir ) is primarily responsible to pay the debts of the deceased; but if the deceased died without leaving any property, then he who takes his wife has to pay the deceased's debts ; if there be no wealth or taker of the deceased's widow, then the son even if he succeeds to no wealth has to pay. This liability may be said to be based on the equitable and moral principle that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased or his widow (over whom the deceased had a sort of dominion) was bound to pay his debts. There appears to be some confict between the texts; but it is more apparent than réal. Verges (like Kāt. 577 ) where the son is placed after the taker of wealth and before the taker of the widow refer to a son who has separate and independent wealth of his own and is more wealthy than the taker of the widow (though he himself being disqualified did not succeed to, ancestral wealth). When there is no wealth and there are several sons one of whom is congenitally blind or otherwise incompetent to succeed then the other sons are liable. From the fact that the taker of the widow is made liable for the debts of the first husband it should not be supposed that the ancient sages approved of widow-remarriage. On the contrary they condemned it ( vide Manu V. 162), but, as the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 51 ) remarks remarriages took place by custom among certain castes and nothing could prevent persons from taking widows as kept mistresses. Therefore as the wife was half of the husband (acc. to Vedic and other passages q. In H. of Dh. vol. IL pp. 428, 584 n. ) she was practically the husband's wealth (Nār. IV. 22 expressly says so ) 765 and so the taker of the widow was saddled with the obligation to pay the debts of the deceased. This sentiment continued to modern times and in the Bombay Presidency the Legislature had to declare ( by Bombay Act VII of 1866, sec. 4) that no person who has married a widow shall merely by reason of such marriage, be liable for any of the debts of any prior husband of such widow'. The Vaijayanti on Viṣnu Dk. S: VI. 30 quotes Yaj. II. 51 and Nār. IV. 23 and

explains them differently. According to it the word 'putra' (in Yaj. II. 51 ) is. qualified by all the three adjectives via "rikthagrāha', 'yoṣidgrāha' (one who is married) and 'ananya. sritadravya'(one who has no wife nor child and one who has taken no ancestral wealth, either because he does not desire it or because none exists). Therefore according to it among sons, the son that takes ancestral wealth has to pay the debts of the father, on failure of such a son when some of the sons are married and some are not, the married ones have to repay ancestral debts and lastly when there are no married sons the one that is wifeless, childless and also without wealth has to pay them. 

Niksepa ( deposit). The words niksepa, upanidhi and nyāsa are sometimes said to be synonyms (as done by Amara ) 766, though several ancient works define them separately. According to Yaj. II. 65 upanidhi is the deposit of an article enclosed in a box or the like made with another without telling him of the contents of the box. Yaj. II. 67 holds nyāsa and niksepa to be different from upanidhi. Nārada 767 as quoted in the Mit. on Yaj. II. 65 defines upanidhi as the deposit of an article in a sealed receptacle without counting it in the presence of the person to whom it is entrusted and without telling him what the receptacle contains, while a nikṣepa is a deposit entrusted to a man after counting the articles in his presence. Manu VIII, 149 (Vas. 16. 18), Kaut. III. 12 hold niksepa and upa nidhi to be distinct. A verse quoted by Kșirasvāmin on Amara defines nyāsa as an open deposit and niksepa as the delivery of some goods to an artist or crafteman for being worked up or manufactured. Nār. (V. 1 and 5) defines niksepa as the deposit of one's articles with another through confidence, while upanidhi is defined in the same way as Yāj. II. 65. Visvarūpa 768 defines nyāsa as an open deposit for safe custody and nikṣepa as delivery of one's article to another for handing over to a

third. Kat. (592) makes 769 upanidhi a generio term for all bail. ments such as a sold article remaining in the hands of the vendor, & deposit, a pledge, bailment to one for delivery to another, loan of article for temporary use, goods handed over for sale to an agent. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 67 defines nyasa as handing over to some member in the house an article in the absence of the head of the house for delivery to the head of the house and nikṣepa as a deposit in the presence of the deposites himself. The V. P. p. 280 briefly distinguishes the three as noted below.770 

Nikṣepa or upanidhi was a bailment made in trust and differed from an ādhi in this that the former was not given by way of security for a debt or for collecting interest but in confidence for safe custody.771 Br. (SBE vol. 33p. 332 verse 2) says that such a deposit is made with another when one is leaving one's home, or through fear of the king or for depriving one's kinsmen.772 Manu VIII. 179 (=Nar. V.2) says that one should entrust a deposit to a person who is born of a good family, is well-conducted, knows dharma, speaks the truth, has a large family, is wealthy and straightforward. The person with whom a deposit is made generally receives no personal benefit from it; hence the smrtis (such as Br. in SBE 33 p. 333 verses 6-8) extol the holder 773 of a deposit made in trust to be as meritorious as one who makes gifts of gold or other inferior

metals or clothes and condemn the misappropriation of a deposit or the losing of it through negligence as very sinful. The idea is that no one is bound to accept a deposit, but when a person accepts it, his primary duty is to preserve it with oare and the next duty is to return it at the time agreed or on demand. The obligation arises from the trust reposed in a person. The rights of the bailee are limited as compared to those of the mortgagee or pledgee, but the very fact of his custody in trust clothes him with certain rights. The amount of care required of the depositoe is the same as in the case of an ādhi, viz. he is to take the same care of it as he takes of his own goods and is not liable if the deposit is lost ( along with his own property ) through act of God or the king or is stolen by thieves (Manu VIII. 189, Yāj. II. 66, Nār. V. 9 and 12, Br. in S.B.E. 33 p. 333, verse 10, Kāt. 593 ).774 In the Mșochakatika Cārudatta accepts liability for the loss of the ornaments deposited with him by Vasantasenā, though they were stolen, because of his high sense of chivalry and of his idea that proper care was not taken by him or his friend. But Nār. V. 9 is careful to add that the loss through vis major or through theft must be real and not fraudulently brought about. 775 Nār. V. 6 and Bp. (in SBE 33 p. 334 verge 14 ) state that a deposit may be made in the presence of witnesses or without them, that it should be returned in the same way and condition in which it was made and that if there is a dispute, it may be settled by ordeal ( when there are no witnesses ). 776 The article deposited must be returned in the same condition ( as regards seal &c.) in which it was handed over (Yāj. II. 65 ). It must also be returned to the man himself wbo made the deposit and not to his co-owners ( Manu VIII. 185, Br, in SBE 33 p. 333 verse 9).777 He is estopped

from recognising the title of any one except the depositor, as in section 116 of the Indian Evidence Act. But if the bailor be dead the bailee can return it of his own accord without demand to the co-owners (Manu VIII. 186 = Nār. V. 10). In doing so however he must not return it to one of several heirs, but to all or in the presence of all. The loss of a deposit may be due to the fact that the bailee consumes it by using it, or to the bailee's negligence or to his ignorance. In these cases the bailee was made to reimburse the bailor for the loss. But Kāt. ( 597 ) 778 makes a difference, viz. when a bailes consumes the deposit by use he should be made to pay the price with interest, when he loses it through negligence he is to pay only the price (but without interest) and if he loses through ignorance, then he is to pay a little less (i. e. less by one-fourth ) than the price. Vide Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 333 verse 11 ) and Nār. V. 8. If a bailor knowing the proposed bailee to be a careless man deposits his goods with him, the bailee is not liable even if the goods are lost from any cause whatever ( Kāt. 599 ).779 If immediately on demand by the depositor the bailee does not return the thing deposited or it is lost after demand from any cause whatever (including act of God or king ), the bailee' has to return the thing or the price of the thing (when lost) and also is liable to be fined by the king in the same amount ( Yāj. IL. 66, Nār. V.7). If the bailee makes use of the article bailed without the permission of the bailor, he should be fined by the king and should be made to return the thing bailed with interest ( Yāj. II. 67, Nār. V. 8). In the Rāj. T. ( VIIL 124-157 ) occurs the story of a person who had deposited one lakh of dināras with a merchant and had withdrawn some money from time to time. It further states that, when the balance was demanded, the merchant furnished a statement of accounts giving a list of

fiotitious items of withdrawals for many years with interest and showing that very little of the deposit was left. The king brought home the fraud to the merchant and ordered that the original deposit being used by the merchant should bear interest. 

Kat. (506) provides that when a deposit, a balance of interest, purchase price ( not paid though the article be delivered to vendee ), or sale price ( article sold being retained by vendor though price is paid) is not returned or paid when demand is made, it carries interest at 5 per cent (from the date of demand ).780 Manu VIII. 191 (which is almost the same as Nār. V. 13) provides that where a bailes does not return the deposit though demand ed or where a person without making a deposit claims it from a person, both are to be punished as a thief by the king and to be made to pay a fine equal in amount to the price of the bailed article (claimed). The deposit has to be taken back at the proper time by the depositor and the bailee has to avoid returning it at an improper time; if the latter returns at an improper time he should be made to pay a fine double of the value of the thing 781 (Kat. 601 ). 

Yaj. II. 67, Nār. V. 14, Br. 782 ( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 334 verge 15 ) extend these rules about niksepa to other kinds of bail ments viz. to yācitaka ( an article such as an ornament borrowed from a man on a festive occasion), anvāhita ( what is handed over to a third man and is the property of another and has been pledged with a man), nyāsa, upanidhi, filpinyāsu ( giving an article such as gold to an artisan like a goldsmith for preparing an ear-ring or the like), pratinyāsa (mutual deposit). Some of the rules about yācitaka are stated above

Rules about loss of yācitaka 

459 

(pp. 426-427). Kaut. 783 III. 12 states that a yūcitaka or avakrita (lent on hire ) article should be returned in the same condition in which it was received. If lost through act of God or king or through theft (after taking proper care ) the depositee would not be liable. Kāt. ( 610 ) provides 784 that he who having taken the loan of an article for use does not deliver it even on demand should be restrained (by the owner ) and forcibly made to return it and fined by the king if he does not return it; he should be made to pay the price with interest ( if the thing be lost after demand). If the loan of an article was taken for a specified period or for a particular occasion or purpose and a demand for return be made in the middle and the article is not returned when demanded, the person taking the loan would not be made to pay the price : but if a person who has taken on loan an article does not return it after the period fixed has expired or the purpose is served, the borrower must offer to the owner the price if the article be destroyed or lost and if he does not return even after demand (when the period has ended ) the borrower would have to pay the price with interest. 

Kat. (609) states a reasonable counter-exception to the rule in 606 viz. 'when the owner of an article borrowed by another is likely to sustain loss if the article borrowed were not returned on demand, then the borrower should be made to deliver it even though the time fixed has not ended or the pur pose of the loan was only half fulfilled'. 

There are some special rules about $ilpinyāsa also. Kat. ( 603-604) provides that if an artisan or craftsman retains an article delivered to him beyond the time that was settled (or

agreed) for finishing the work he should be made to pay (its price ) even if the article was lost through act of God, but the artisan shall not be liable to pay the price if the article were to be lost through defects in the article itself; if (however ) what is delivered for being worked or polished is destroyed through the fault of the artisan he should be made to pay the price 785 

From the fact that Kāt. 596 (quoted above in n. 778) employs the expression 'dāpyah sa eva tat' (he alone who misappro priates or causes loss of a deposit by negligence), the words of Gaut. XII. 39 ( quoted above under adhi) and the fact that nikṣopa is a title distinct from rṇādāna (under which alone the liability of sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons is expressly declared ) it follows that song are not liable for the misappro priation or loss of a deposit or article bailed to their father or other ancestor provided they have not themselves joined or helped in the embezzlement or loss. This is made clear by Haradatta on Gaut. XII. 39, the Vivādacintāmaṇi and the Vivādacandra quoted below 786. 

It is interesting to note that Nār. 787 V. 15 places on the same level (as to liability for loss ) with the depositee and the like the man who takes in his charge a minor that has & good deal of wealth i.e. the person undertaking the position of the guardian of a minor's property has to take as much care of it as of his own and is liable in the same circumstances as a

depositee would be for loss of the minor's property. Vide section 27 of the Guardian and Wards Act ( VIII of 1890 ) for the care required of a guardian 788. 

788. The British India Courts have been very much exercised over the question of the liability of ancestral property in the hands of the son for the obligations incurred by the father by his misconduct or embezzlement either as agent or manager for another or as guardian of a minor's property. It would follow from the passages quoted in n. 786 that ancestral property in the hands of the sons is not liable, acc, to some of our digests, if the father used or lost a deposit or loaned article by his negligence or mismanaged a minor's property. It is firmly established that the son is not liable for a debt facurred by the father in circumstances which would render the father liable to a criminal prosecution, Vide Toshanpal Singh v. Distriot Judge of Agra 61 I. A. 350. In the latest case on the point, Govindprasad u. Raghunathprasadx41 Bom. L. R. : 589 (F. B.) the exemption is carried further and it is recognized that as to the exemption of the son for 'avyāu. gharika' debts of the father, there are many cases which cannot be recon ciled, that it is repugnant to good sense to construe ancient texts in the light of a system of criminal Jurisprudence developed long after and that tho correct rule is to hold that the son can claim immunity when he proves that the debt of the father was of a character which was illegal, dishonest or inmoral (p. 602)' though difficult cases may arise in the application of this rule. It would be far beyond the scope of this work to cite or discuss the other numerous decisions,OY

CHAPTER XVII ASVĀMIVIKRAYA ( sale by one not the owner ). 

The different modes of the sources of ownership have already been referred to ( H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 130 ff) and will be referred to again under dayabhāga. According to Nār. VII. 1 and Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 335 verse 2) when 789 a person, who holds an open deposit, a sealed deposit, an article bailed for delivery to another, stolen property, an article borrowed for some festival, a pledge, or property lost by a stranger and found ( by him ), sells it in secret ( or behind the back of the owner ) it is to be considered as a sale by one who is not the rightful owner. Vyasa has a similar verse. The word 'sells' is only illustrative and includes gifts and pledges. Similarly as most sales by one not the owner are clandestinely brought about, Bs. employs the words in secret' but even if the sale is effected openly the same consequences may follow. The same rules will apply to an article lost by the owner and found by a stranger. Kat. ( 612 ) provides 790 that a sale, gift, or pledge, made by one who is not the owner, should be rescinded ( by the king or judge), Manu VIII. 199 and Nar. (q. by Sm. C. II. p. 213, V. P. p. 291 ) and others say the same thing. Yāj. II. 168, Nār. VII. 2 provide that the owner is entitled to recover his property from the person that purchases from one who is not the owner. If the buyer purchases an article not in the open market, then he is liable for punishment; if he purchases from one who could have no means of posgessing the thing sold (such as a slave without the master's consent) or for a very inadequate price or at a very unusual hour (at midnight or

Such a sale is a fraudulent one. If the buyer purchases (through ignorance ) in market overt from one who is not the owner, he incurs no blame ( no punishment), but he may have to hand over the article to the real owner ( Viṣnu Dh. 8. V 164-166 ).791 The purchaser from one not the real owner can free himself by producing the vendor (called inūla in Manu VIII. 202, Bṛ. and Kat. ) and should not attempt to conceal from whom he came by the thing, otherwise he would be liable to be punished equally with the vendor as a thief (Nar. VII. 4). Br. ( SBE 33 p. 335 versd 3), Manu VIII. 201 and Yāj. II. 170 say that when the vendor has been produced by the vondee, then the latter is not to be proceeded against, but the vendor has to litigate with the real owner who has lost his property and when the vendor loses the suit he has to pay the price to the buyer and a fine to the king and the owner gets his property back. 792 If the vendor has gone abroad adequate time should be granted to the purchaser to produce him ( Kāt. 615). The purchaser in order to escape blame (punishment) has to produce the vendor and if that cannot be done owing to the vendor's absence he has to prove that he, purchased 793 openly (Bp. in SBE 33 p. 335 v. 4, Manu VIII. 202, Kāt. 615, 618-619). If he cannot do any of these two, then the purchaser would be liable to pay the price to the real owner as claimed and a fine to the king. Manu VIII. 198 prescribes that one who sells without being the owner but being a member of the owner's family should be fined 600 paṇas, while a vendor unconnected with the real owner's family should be dealt with as a thief. The same rule applies to a

vendor selling another's article through ignorance or mistake and one doing so with full knowledge. The person who has lost a chattel and claims it from the finder is described as nāṣtika 74 in Kauṭ. III. 16, Manu VIII. 202, Kāt. ( 614) and elsewhere, the word being derived from naṣta ( what is lost). The idea is that openly purchasing an article in the presence of a number of people for an adequate price negatives fraudulent intent and leads to the inference of a purchase in good faith and such a purchaser even though he may have to part with the chattel to the real owner when the latter proves his title, incurs no blame and is entitled to recover from the vendor, if he has to surrender the article, the price paid by him. When a person claims & lost article as his he has first to prove his title and possession by evidence (such as that of his kinsmen or a document &c. ) and that he had not sold or donated or abandoned it; 95 after he has proved his title the purchaser is called upon to prove his purchase as honest by evidence i. e. by producing the vendor or by showing that he purchased openly and for adequate price (Kāt. 613, Yaj. II. 170). When this is done the purchaser escapes blame but has to surrender the article to the true owner. Kat. (616 ) adds 796 that in the case of 'agvāmi-vikraya' no other means of proof whether divine or human (except the evidence of witnesses such as kinsmen) is declared to be proper. Acc. to the V. P. p. 293 other evidence and even ordeals may be admissi ble in sale without ownership, but the Sm. O. p. 216 and the Madanaratna say that on account of the express words of Kat. this is not possible. If the owner who alleges the loss of an article fails to prove his title and prior possession he has to pay a fine to the king equal to fth of the price of the article, Kāt. ( 620 ) and Kaut. (.III. 16 ) state that on failure to prove his title the person claiming 797 the article as his should be fined as a thief, in order to deter (others) from taking undue advantage (i. e. preferring false claims ).

provide that when the real owner finds his lost article in the hands of a stranger he should get him apprehended by the royal officers (such as chauroddharanika, acc. to Mit. ), but that if the owner thinks that much time will be lost or distance will have to be traversed ( for going to officers ) he should himself seize the person and bring him before the court. The Mit. explains that the buyer should have the seller arrested and, if the seller is dead or gone abroad, that he should hand over the article to 

· the real owner. Where a purchase has been made in the midst of a row of traders to the knowledge of the king's officers, but from a vendor whose habitation was unknown or where ( after the purchase ) the vendor dies, the real owner (of the thing sold by one not the owner) will recover his own property after paying half the price to the purchaser, since the rule of justice in such a case so requires, because to purchase from one ( whose habitation is ) not known is a fault (in the purchaser ) and not taking proper care (of one's goods ) is also a fault in the real owner (Bṛ. in S. B. E. vol. 33 pp. 335-36 verses 7-9 or Kāt. 621-623 )799, Marici (q. by Aparārka p. 775, Sm. C. II. p. 217 ) has similar provisions. Br. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 335 verse 800 6) provides that in a suit where there is no evidence the king shall take into consideration the character of the litigants and give a decision according as the credibility of the parties is equal, greater or less.

CHAPTER XVIII 

SAMBHŪYA-SAMUTTHĀNA 801 (A joint undertaking, partnership). 

Where traders or others (like actors, musicians or artisans) carry on a business jointly it is termed a partnership (Nar. VI. 1 and Kat. 624).802_Bx. (SBE Vol. 33 p. 336 verses 1-2) says that a man should carry on a joint business with other persons of good family, that are clever, active, intelligent (or educated), familiar with coins, skilled in ( controlling ) expenditure and income, honest and valiant ( or enterprising ) and that joint undertakings like trade should not be carried on by prudent men with persons (partners ) who are weak or lazy or afflicted with disease or are unlucky or destitute ( of money ), 803 The meaning is not that all the above qualities must exist in all partners, but that according to the nature of the undertaking some of these qualities will be absolutely necessary. Nar. VI. 2-3, Yaj. II. 259, Br. (SBE vol. 33 pp. 336-337 verses 3 and 4) prescribe that the expenses, loss, profit or work of those who jointly lend gold, grain or liquids shall be according to the capital put in by each. 804 The duty of each is to act honestly towards the others, whether they are present or absent, 

801. सम्भूय is the indeclinable past participle of the root भू with सम् and means 'having formed together or come together' and Eura means 'under taking'. So the two words mean undertaking in which are joined together' (labour, capital or both).

Duties of partners 

467 

in sales or purchases of various commodities. 805 Bp. (SBE vol. 33 p. 337 verses 5-7) provides that whatever s6 property one partner may give ( or transfer ), being authorised to do so by the rest, or whatever document (or transaction ) he may cause to be executed, all that is to be deemed as done by all partners; the partners themselves are declared to be the judges ( the deciding persons) or witnesses among themselves in a doubtful case and in case of fraud, provided they are not already at feud among themselves. It follows from this that by entering into an agreement of partnership, each partner agrees that he submits to the decision of the other partners in cases of doubt. If any one from them is found out to have practised fraud on the others in sales or purchases he should clear himself by special oaths or ordeals. Yāj. II. 260, Nār. VI. 5,807 Bṛ. (SBE vol. 33 p. 337 verse 9 ) provide that each partner is responsible to make good what has been lost through his negligence or in consequence of his acting against the instructions of the others or of his acting without their authority or consent. If any one of the partners saves partnership property from act of God or the king or thieves ( or similar calamity ) by his own exertions he is to be awarded (as his special share ) one tenth of the property saved ( Yaj. II. 260, Kāt. 631, 808 Nār. VI. 6). If any partner is crooked or fraudu lent the rest may expel him without giving him any profit; a partner who is incompetent to work (personally ) should get the partnership business done through another ( Yāj. II. 265 ). Yaj. II. 264 and Nār. VI. 7 and 17-18 state that if one partner

goes to a foreign country and dies, his share should be taken by his heirs ( Bon &c.) or by his agnates or cognates ; in default of these the other partners may take it and in default of them the king may take it after waiting for ten years to see whether any heir or claimant turns up. Katyayana 309 states that in the case of artisans who together carry out some work, those among them who are directors of new methods get four shares, those who are adepts in the craft three shares, those who have studied the craft two shares and the apprentices only one share. Whatever is given to strangers by all together (i. e. by the partnership firm ) should be claimed back by the firm as such ; any single partner should not claim it; if he does so he will lose his share of the profit 810. Some rules are prescribed by Br. that among dancers, singers and musicians, the singers get equal shares; while those who beat the tune only get half share each; similarly in the joint construction of a mansion or a temple the head of the artisans gets two shares. An artisan 811 (Silpin) is one who manufactures or works upon gold, silver, yarn, wood, stone and hides or one who has mastered one of the ( 64 ) arts. If a king has ordered a band of adventurers from among his subjects to make a plundering expedition in enemy country, Br. (in V. R. p. 125 ) and Kāt. (633-635 ) 812 prescribe that the king gets one tenth (acc. to Bṛ.), the leader gets four shares in the remainder, the valiant among his followers three (shares, the more capable two shares and the rest one each and that if any one of them is caught the money for his ransom should be oontributed by all according to their shares. When no agree ment is made as to shares in property by traders, husbandmen, thieves and artisans similar rules apply 813.

Rules about distribution of sacrificial fees 

469 

It is interesting to note that the ancient Dharmasūtras of Gautama, Apastamba and Baudhāyana are silent about partner ships, that Manu (VIII. 206-210 ) lays down rules about the distribution of fees among the priests at a sacrifice and that in one verse ( VIII. 211) he remarks that the same principles are to be applied in all matters where men work conjointly (i. e. each is to be paid according to the importance and voluine of the work he does). The rules about sacrificial priests in Manu are: If a priest chosen to do work in a sacrifice abandons his work a share only of the fee in proportion to the work ( done ) shall be given to him by those conjointly working with him; if a priest leaves after the fees are distributed (as at the time of midday extraction of Soma in the great sacrifices like Jyotiṣtuma ) then he keeps the whole of it and shall cause the renraining work to be performed by another (who will be paid by the sacrificer, acc. to Medhatithi). When specific fees are prescribed to be paid to individual priests at the performance of the several parts in a complicated sacrifice, the individual priests are to receive them and all are not to participate; as for example, the adhvaryu takes the chariot, the brahmā priest takes the horse in Agnyādhāna, the hotalso takes the horse and the udgātr the cart used in purchasing the soma plant. The four chief priests are entitled to one half of the fees, the first group of their assistants will get half of what the chief ones get, the 2nd group and the fourth . Nār. VI. 10 and Bṛ. ( in V, R. p. 120) state that sacrificial priests are of three kinds viz. one hereditary and honoured by the ancestors of the sacrificer, one appointed by the sacrificer himself and one who performs the functions of his own accord through friendship and that (VI. 9 and 11 ) if an officiating priest forsakes a sacrificer who is free from any fault and who has caused no harm or if a sacrificer abandons a priest who is faultless, they both shall be punished but this does not apply to the third kind of priest. Saṅkha-Likbita, as quoted in V. R. pp. 117 and 120-121 and Sm. C. II. p. 188, give elaborate rules about sacri ficial priests dying or leaving work and the fines to be imposed on them. Kaut. III. 14 lays down rules for the receipt of fees by priests when they leave off at different stages of such solemn sacrifices as the Agnistoma and also when the sacrificer dies without completing the sacrifice. The Vy. Nir. (pp. 284-285 ) quotes a few sentences from Kaut. III. 14. 

The above shows that in the times of the ancient sūtras, secular partnerships had not attained sufficient importance and 

470 

History of Dhurmuśasira 

i voi. 

even in the times of the Manusmrti almost the same was the case. While Manu extends the rule about the distribution of fees at a sacrifice 814 to secular joint undertakings, Yāj. ( 11. 265 ) extends the general rules about the partnerships of traders to sacrificial priests, husbandmen, craftsmen (like carpenters, dancers &c.). That shows that complicated sacrifices requiring a large number of priests had become rare in Yājñavalkya's days and partnerships of traders and artisans had assumed great importance.

814. In solemn sacrifices like the foreta there are four principal priests (gig, a, gra, TTT) and each of the four has three assistants, If 100 cows in all are to be distributed as dakṣinā the four principal priests get 48 in all (i. e. 12 each), the first group of four assistants called 

• ardhinah' in the Vedic passages to be quoted below and in Manu VIII. 210 (viz. H GUT, TUPUTS, WET , FIE) receive one-half of 48 (i. e. 24, 6 for each), the next group of four called 'one-thirders' (antra:) in both get 16 (4 to each of TT, A , spate), the last group of four called one-fourth holders' ( \#:) get 12 in all (3 to each of ure , 

org, atg, poo). Vide Mit. on Yaj. II. 265, Kullūka on Manu. VIII. 210, V. R. p. 119, V. P. p. 301. The autre X. 2. 25 says TUTTTH Test Tia: tarxet t ore at: 1. The question of distribution is agitated in Jai. X. 3. 53-55, the prima facie (pūrvapaksa) view being that tbe cows should be equally divided among all the priests or according to the work done, while the conclusion is that since the sruti employs the words अधिनः, तुतीयिनः and पादिनः as if it was a well-known matter (anuvāda), the cows are to be distributed as in Kāt. Ś, sūtra above. The Vedic passage is अध्ययुगृहपति दीक्षयित्वा ब्रह्माणं दीक्षयति तत उदातारं ततो होतारम् । ततस्तं मतिमस्थाता दीक्षयित्वाधिनो दीक्षपति । ... ततस्तं नेष्टा दीक्षपिखा तुतीयिनो दाक्षपीत। ... ततस्तमुजेता दीक्षयिस्वा पादिनो दीक्षयति । 

## 19 Dattānapākarma

CHAPTER XIX 

DATTĀNAPAKARMA (resumption of gift). 

This title is also called dattāpradūnika 815 (lit. that which is concerned with the non-delivery or resumption of a gift ). Nār. VII. 1 defines it as that title where a man desires to resume what has been given by him because it has been improperly (in a manner opposed to law ) given by him. Nār. (VII. 2 ) divides this title into four topics viz, what may not be given, what may be given, what are valid gifts and what are invalid gifts, Nār. VII. 3-5 and Br. (SBE vol. 33 p. 342 verse 2) state that there are eight things that cannot be given (adeyu ) viz, an anvāhita, a deposit, yācitaka, a pledge, property jointly owned with others, a deposit, son and wife, the entire property in the case of one who has offspring, and what has been already promised to another. Vide Kauṭ. III. 16, Yāj. II. 175 816 for a similar but more com pendious statement, and Kāt. 638. These cannot be given either because they are not one's absolute property or because the gift of them is forbidden by the sages. In the case of even those who hold that one has ownership over one's son or wife, the gift of them is not possible because it is forbidden, just as though one owns rice, yavas and māṣı beans, one cannot make offerings of maṣa because the veda prohibits their use in the words' ayajñiyā vai māṣāḥ'(q. by Sabara on Jai. VI. 3. 20). So son and wife cannot be given on account of the prohibition in the smrtis. The general rule of what may be given is stated 

815. \#UTU on AT. VIII. 214 explains it as por E41974: 44 तत्रामतिषेधः । दानमेवं न चलितं भवति । एषैव दाने स्थितिरिति यावत् । कथं प्रतिभुत्यादीय माने धर्मो न नश्यतीति नैषा शङ्का कर्तव्या। एष एवान धर्मो यम दीयते दत्तं च प्रत्यादीयते । So acc. to this 

\# means "not improper abstraction of what is given or promised to be given.' The her. on T. II. 175 explains both quihanan and T re as follows : 74 39 Thero retaret दसाप्रदानिक नाम भ्यवहारपदम् । ... दत्तस्य अनपाकर्म अपुनरादानं यत्र दानाख्ये विषादपदे HETagen Acc. to this That means that in which what is donated cannot be taken back because the gift is according to law' (also impliedly the converse of it).

( SBE 33 p. 342 verse 3), Kat. 640 viz. whatever is absolutely one's own excepting that required for the maintenance of one's family may be given. 817 Manu (XI. 9-10), Nār. VII. 6 and Br. (quoted in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 850-851 n. 2007) condemn those who stint their family or servants in order to be charitable to others and say that he who does so would incur sin. Manu XI. p (=Nār. VII. 7), Vas. VIII. 10, Yāj. I. 124, Viṣnu Dh. S. 59.8 prescribe that he alone who has property sufficient to provide for three years' mainten ance for those whom he is bound to maintain or has more wealth than that may drink soma i. e. may engage in a soma sacrifice (which costs much ). 

Nār. VII. 8 states that there are seven kinds of dutta gifts, i. e. gifts or transfers that cannot be resumed because they are made by a person in full possession of his faculties and of things that belong to him absolutely and are not forbidden. They are: the price paid for goods bought, wages, what is paid for pleasure (derived from dancing, singing, wrestling ), a gift through affection, a gift made in gratitude, money paid to a bride's kinsmen, and gifts for spiritual or charitable purposes. Acc. to Br. 818 (SBE vol. 33 p. 343 verse 8) there are eight kinds of valid gifts. Nār. VII. 9-11 mentions sixteen kinds of invalid gifts, which have already been set out ( in H. of Dh. vol. II p. 887 where Gaut. V. 22 that specifies some invalid gifts has also been cited). Vide Kāt. 647. The difference between gifts of adeya and adatta gifts is this. In the first class of cases, the gifts being forbidden are entirely null and void, while adatta gifts are those that are voidable and may be set aside by the court on the application of the donor himself, because, of the incapacity of the donor due to intoxication, lunacy, old age, minority, mistake etc. Kāt. 646 and Kaut. (III. 13 ) state

that if a man 819 is in danger of life and promises the gift of all his property to whomsoever may save him, he may resile from the promise and pay only what an expert or arbitrator may award. Kāt. (650-651) defines utkoca (bribe ) 820 as what is obtained in these ways viz. by giving (or threatening to give false) information about a person as a thief or a felon, or as one who breaks the rules of decent conduct, or as an adulterous person, or by pointing out those who are of bad character or by spreading false reports about a person. He further provides that a person offering the bribe should not be fined, but this intermediary may be fined and if the person accepting the bribe has been appointed to an office by the king he should be made to return the bribe and pay a fine eleven times as much to the king. But Kat. adds that where a person not holding a public appointment obtains some gratification for work done, he would not be held guilty and would not have to return what he received as a reward or in gratitude. Hārsta holds out 821 other-worldly evil consequences for not actually delivering what is promised or for resuming what has been already delivered as a gift viz. the person doing so falls into Hell and is born as one of the lower animals and adds that what is promised as a gift for a religious purpose in so many words but is not actually delivered becomes a debt in this world and the next i. e. the king should make the promisor give the

The Indian Penal Code, section 116 (illustration a) read with sec. 161, makes one who offers a bribe to a public servant punish able as an abettor.

promised gift and should inflict a fine, Kāt. (642) provides 822 that a man who having voluntarily promised a gift to a brahmana does not deliver it should be made to render it as a debt and should be awarded the lowest amercement and further ( verso 566 ) that if a man promises a gift for a religious purpose whether in good health or in disease, his son (or other heir) should be made to pay it if the promisor died without actually delivering it. These verses show that in two cases gifts though not completed by delivery of possession were enforced by ancient Indian courts viz. when the gift was promised to a brāhmaṇa or when the gift was declared to be made for a religious and charitable purpose. The last verse contains the beginnings of the idea of a will, since the mere declaration of the intention of a man to give for a religious purpose is made enforceable after his death against his son or heir. But this germ could not evolve into a full-fledged law of testamentary succession on account of the practice of adoption, the requirement that a gift must be accompanied by present possession and the incidents of the joint family on account of which no single member could alienate family property except for legal necessity and which involved the dootrine that on the death of a member his rights ended and passed by survivorship to other members. Br. expressly states this. 823 But a gift though promised need not be paid or carried out if the promisee turns out to be an irreligious man (Gaut. V. 21 ). Nār. VII. 12 and Br. provide that he who enjoys an invalid gift and he who makes a forbidden gift are both to be punished by the king. 824 

In H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 841 it has been stated that gift consists in the cessation of the ownership of the donor in a thing and creating ownership in another. This latter is effected by accep tance (svikāra) by the donee. Acceptance may be made men tally, vocally or physically.

offering of a dakṣiṇā to the donee, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 855. Some writers like Jimõtavāhana dispute the statement 825 that acceptance is necessary to constitute a gift. The Dāyabhāga states that by the mere relinquishment of a thing by the donor (i, e. by the activity of the donor himself) the ownership of the thing passes to the person intended as the dones, that the ownership of the other man does not arise by acceptance, that though ownership in the donee does arise by the mere activity of the donor, yet acceptance ( svikāra ) which is an activity of the donee makes the thing donated capable of being disposed off by the donee as he likes on account of his idea 'this is mine'. The Dayabhāga indulges in casuistical reasoning in support of its view, which it is not necessary to get out here. But the remarks of the Dayabhāga are not satisfactory, since it does not adequately explain what is to happen if the intended donee refuses the gift. On its hypothesis ownership has passed to the donee without acceptance being necessary. If the dones refuges, or dies without accepting, who is the owner? Can it be said that the thing becomes the property of whosoever first takes it up and that the donor cannot prevent a third person taking it up? The V. P. pp. 426-428 severely criticizes the Dayabhāga for its views.

VETANASYANAPĀKARMA, ABHYUPETYASUŚRŪSĀ 

AND SVĀMIPĀLAVIVADA (Non-payment of wages, non-rendition of service, dispute 

between master and herdsman ). 

TH 

The question about the payment or non-payment of wagen to those whose services are hired for work is dealt with under this title ( Nār. IX. 1). According to Bp. there 826 are three titles of law in which the question of hiring enters, viz. abhyupetya $usrūṣā, vetanasyānapākarma and svūnipūlavivāda. Manu and Kauṭ. do not treat of the first of these three. Here vetanasya napākurma will be first dealt with, then abhyupetyāśutrūṣā and suāmipālavivāda will be separately treated of. All these three topics are concerned with masters and servants or employers and employees. The rules are different according as the contract of service is for a fixed term or for an indefinite period or is for executing a definite piece of work and according as the rate of wages or the hire is fixed beforehand or is not fixed. We have further to remember that the rules are spread over a large period i. e. from about 6th century B. C. to about 500 A. D. (from Gaut. and Āp. to Bṛ. and Kat. ). The rules deal with the liabilities of both masters and servants. Nar.IX.2 states that the wages agreed upon may be paid at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of the work undertakon, But when no wages are settled beforehand Nār. IX. 3, Yāj. II. 194, Kaut. III. 327 13 provide that the ( agent of a ) trader, the cowherd, the husbandman should receive a tenth part respectively of the profit, of the milk and of the crops. This latter according to the Sm. C. II 

p. 201 holds good where the crops are raised easily. But Br.

Determination of proper wages 

( S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 345 828 verge 13 ) lays down the rule that if the employer supplies food and clothing to the servant, the latter should get a fifth part of the crops (if no wages are settled) or a third part if the servant is given no food nor clothing by the employer: .When no wages are settled Vṛddha Manu prescribes that proper wages will be determined by experts in carrying 829 maritime trade (and other traders ) who take into consideration the time, the place and the purpose. Even when the wages were settled the employer could give less or more according to his pleasure in certain cases viz. when a servant or agent acts against the restrictions of time and place prescribed by his employer and consequently the profit is much less, the employer may give less than what is agreed but if the agent brings more profit ( than expected ) he may give more ( Yāj. II. 195). When two or more employees under take to finish a work but cannot finish it (owing to ill-health or similar obstacle ) each of them should be given the wages appropriate to the portion done by each (as settled by an arbitrator), but if the whole work is finished by them the agreed wages must be paid to all of them together (Yāj. II. 196). Yāj. II. 193, Nār. IX, 4 and 830 Bṛ, state that it is the duty of the employed or servant to take as much care of the utensils supplied by the employer as he would take of his own, and that he should not act in that respect wantonly (or crookedly ) and that if he did so his wages would become less. If a hired servant, after receiving his wages, does not do the work agreed to be done though able to do so, he should be made to repay to the employer the wages received and a fine equal to double of the wages and if he had not received wages but left the work without cause he should be made to pay to the employer

an amount equal to the wages (Yaj. II. 193, Nār. IX. 5, Br. in 831 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 345 verse 15). Kaut. (III. 14 ) prescribes a fine of 12 papas for a hired servant who does not do the work undertaken even after receiving the wages and that he should be compelled to do the work. Nār. IX, 5 and Kāt. 657 provide that that the king should compel him to do the work and then the agreed wages may be paid to him ; but if he does not do it he should be fined. 832 The fine in such cases aco, to Vṛddha Manu was 200 paṇas. Manu VIII. 215 and Bs. (S. B. E. 33 p. 345 verse 16) and Matsya 227.9 provide that a hired servant, who though not ill, does not arrogantly do the work agreed should be fined eight kȚsnalas and would not get wages at all. This applies where a substantial portion is left undone, but where only a little of the work undertaken is left undone then the servant is not to be fined, but he would lose all the wages (Manu VIII. 217 ). But if a servant falls ill, then he may do the work after he becomes well and would get the agreed wages even if a long time may have elapsed (Manu VIII. 216 ). Kaut. ( III. 14 ) also provides that if the servant suffers from illness or is overwhelmed by a calamity, concession may be given to him or he may offer a substitute. The Ap. Dh, S. (II. 11.28. 2-4 ) prescribes that if a husbandman who is not a slave

Kaut. (III. 13 ) states that if the employer does not pay the wages he should be fined six panas or a tenth part of the proper wag es or the wages agreed upon and if the hired person denies the receipt of wages (though he really received them ) he should be fined twelve papas or a fifth part of the wages. 833 Kaut. (III. 14 ) further provides that in the contract of service it may be provided that the master is not to employ

Yaj. II. 197, Nār. IX. 9, Kāt. 659, Vigpu Dh. S. 834 V. 155-156 provide that if through the fault of a carrier (and not through act of God or the king) goods entrusted to him for carrying are lost or become deteriorated, he should be made to pay for the loss. Vṭddha-Manu specifies that if the goods are lost through the negligence of the servant he has to pay only the price, but if through spite then he should be made to pay double the price. If a hired servant ( such as a palanquin-bearer or an armed guard) causes obstruction (by refusing to work ) at the time of starting for an auspicious matter ( such as a marriage ), he should be made to pay double the amount of the wages agreed upon and another servant may be engaged (Yaj. II. 197, Nār. IX. 8, Kāt. 658, Vļddha-Manu in V. R. P. 163 ). Yaj. II. 198, Nār. IX. 7 provide that if a servant abandons his work ( as a bearer or guard) after a start is made (when not seized by illness ) he should be made to pay 1, 1 or the whole of the wages according to the distance traversed and a master abandoning a servant in similar circumstances should be made to pay similarly. 

If a servant agrees to take a lump sum for some work to be done for a certain period and leaves the work before the period elapses he would lose all the wages, but if he leaves in the middle of the period through the fault of the employer ( such as scolding without any fault of the servant ) he would be entitled to receive a proportionate part of the wages ( Nār. q. by V. R. p. 161 ). 85 Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 153-154 and 157-158 provide that in the same circumstances the servant would have to pay a fine

of 100 panas and that if the employer abandons the servant before the period fixed has expired he would have to pay the whole of the wages to the servant and a fine of one hundred paṇas (except in the case of act of God and the king ). Kāt. (660) provides that a master deserting on a journey his servant that is tired or falls ill should be fined the first amercement if he does not wait for three days in the village. If a trader after engaging a vehicle or draught animals for carrying bis merchandise for bire, does not employ them to carry his goods he should be made to pay a fourth of the hire settled and the whole of it if he discharges them when only a part of the journey has been made (Nār. IX. 7). If the merchandise be attached 836 ( by the king's officers for toll &c.) or be stolen the servant engaged to carry the goods will receive a propor tionate amount (out of the lump sum agreed to be paid for a certain journey ) according to the distance travelled ( Kāt. 661 ) If the employer does not pay the wages of a servant even though the latter has done his work the king should make him pay the wages and also a proper fine (Bṛ. in S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 346 verge 18). If a man 837 having hired elephants, horses, bulls, asses or camels does not return them even though the work ( for which he hired them) is finished he should be made to restore them together with the hire (up to the day of return). The same rule applies to a man taking on rent a house or water (reservior) or a market and not giving it up at the time fixed (Kat. 662-663). Nār. (IX, 20-21 ) provides that if a person builds a house on another's land by paying rent ( stoma) for the land, he may take away when vacating the land the bricks, the timber and grass ( thatch) of the house built by him, but if a man builds a house on another's land without paying rent and against the owner's wish then he has to leave

the materials of his house to the owner of the land when he has to give up the land. An important rule is stated by Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 346 verse 17) that when a servant 838 employ ed by an employer does some improper act (such as a theft) to another for the benefit of his master, the latter would be lield responsible for the loss. The Matsyapurāṇa says that if a teacher having agreed to teach a loro or craft for money which he receives fails to do so, he should be fined the whole of the amount 839 of the fee. 

From the above it will be clear that contracts of service and letting on hire are lumped together under ono head by the smrtis. 

Kaut. III. 14 provides that persons may be paid wages by a guild or corporation of workers of which they are members. The earnings of such guilds may be divided equally among all workers or as agreed upon among themselves. Yāj. II. 265 also refers to the fact that rules similar to those of partnerships may apply to guilds of husbandmen and artisans. 

Certain rules are laid down in Nār. IX. 18, Yaj. II. 292 and Matsyapurāṇa 227. 144-146 about the monetary liabilities of prostitutes and persons visiting them. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 638-39 above. The Matsyapurana (227. 144-146 ) states that a brāhmana who visits a prostitute should be fined as many paṇas as he paid to her, that if a prostitute after receiv ing her fee does not receive the visitor and goes elsewhere she should be made to pay to the visitor double of the fee and a similar sum as fine to the king, and that if one, after telling a prostitute that she is to visit a certain person, takes her to a different person, he should be fined one gold māsaka. 

The Matsyapurāṇa ( 227.147 ) further states that a visitor who has had sexual intercourse with a prostitute and yet has not paid her fee should be made to pay double the (agreed) fee to her and a similar sum as fine to the king. Nārada provides that the chief prostitutes and the voluptuaries that stay with them

Abhyupetyāśusrūṣā (non-rendition of service after making a contract to serve or obey ) 841. Nār. VIII. 1 defines it as the title in which after having undertaken to serve or obey one does not act up to it. The ancient dharmasūtras mention only two kinds of servants viz. agricultural labourers and herdsmen, Vide Ap. Dh, S. II. 11.28. 2-3 and Gaut. XIL 16-17 842. Acc. to Nār. VIII. % and 3 there are five kinds of servers (or atten. dants ) viz. four that are called kar makara (performers of labour ) and the fifth class comprehends slaves of fifteen kinds ; and the four karmakaras are pupil (siṣya), apprentice (antevāsin), a hired servant (bhrtaka) and one who supervises hired servants (adhikarmakrt). Not being free to do as they like is the common attribute of these five kinds of attendants, but there is a distinction among them due to their castes, their peculiar actions and their mode of maintaining themselves (Nār. VIII. 4). A sisya (pupil) is one who desires (from his teacher) instruc tion in Vedic learning, an antevāsin is one who receives instruc tion in some craft such as goldsmith's work or dancing, a hired servant is one that does some work for wages, an adhikarmakrt is one who supervises hired servants. Work is of two kinds, $ubha (i. e, pure, done by the four kinds of karmakaras ) and adubha i. e, impure ( done only by slaves ). Aśubha acts com prise 443 (Nār. VIII. 6-7 and Kāt. 720) sweeping the doors of houses, pits in which leavings of food are thrown, roads, rubbish heaps; scratching or shampooing the private parts (of the masters ); collecting and throwing away leavings of food, ordure and urine and making use of one's limbs (hand &c.) at the master's desire for wiping off the master's private parts; all other actions are pure. Karmakaras do work for securing Vedio learning or vijñāna ( art or craft ), some desire or money. The

Duties of karmakaras 

483 

duties of a vedic student are described by Nār. VIII. 8-15 and have been set out above in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 305-312 viz. to wait upon the teacher, his wife and son, to beg for food, to sleep on the ground, to do the bidding of the teacher, to learn the vedas, to offer fee to the teacher at the end of vedic study. An apprentice is distinguished in his actions and mode of maintenance from a siṣya. The antevāsin, acc. to Yāj. II. 184, Nār. VIII. 16-21, Br. (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 344 verse 6 ) and Kāt. 713, resides with a master craftsman to learn some 844 art or craft (such as goldsmith's work, singing, dancing, house building ), agreeing to work under him for a stated period, the master craftsman gives him food and teaches him in his own house, does not put him to any other work; if the apprentice leaves the teacher even though the latter is willing to teach him, he ( the pupil) should be made to stay with the teacher and may be whipped or confined; the pupil even though he may have become an adept has to stay with the master till the end of the agreed period and the teacher appropriates the fruits of the apprentice's labour. If the master does not instruct the appren tice in the craft and makes him do other work, he would be liable to pay the first amercement and the pupil may leave him 845 

Hired servants have different grades among them arising from the work they do, the wages they receive and the period for which they are employed and they are distinguished from apprentices in these respects and not as regards caste or mode of maintenance. According to Nār. VIII. 22-23 and Bf. (S. B. E. vol. 33, p. 344 verse 8) a hired servant is of three kinds and his wages depend on the work he does and his ability to do it. The three kinds are the highest (viz. a soldier ), middling (an agriculturist), the lowest 846 ( a porter). A hired servant may

A person who is employed and given authority over all servants and also one who looks to the affairs ( expenditure &c.) of the household is called ' adhikarmakrta ( or-krt), acc. to Nār. VIII. 24. All these four are called workers in clean occupa. tions, while the fifteen kinds of slaves are employed in the lowest and dirtiest work (Nār. VIII. 25). The difference between the hired servants and slaves is this that the latter surrender all their freedom and themselves entirely to another, while the former, though dependent to some extent, do retain some freedom (Kāt. 715), but a brāhmaṇa was not to be a slave 848 In very ancient times the master's liability for the acts of his servant does not seem to have been recognized. For example, Gaut. XII. 17 states that if cattle entrusted to a herdsman cause loss to crops, then the herdsman is to be held responsible (and not the owner who employs the herdsman ). But Manu VIII. 243, Yāj. II. 161, Nār. XIV. 29 appear to hold the master liable to make good the loss caused by the herdsman's default. Vide Bṛ. quoted above under vetanasiū napīkarma. 

The kinds of slaves and the incidents of slavery have been already dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 180-189. A few matters not referred to there may be dealt with here. ' Buddhist India' p. 55 (by Rhys Davids ) shows how slavery in the Buddhist period was not as miserable as under the Greeks. The Rājatarangipi IV. 39 states that king Vajrāditya of Kashmir (in the 8th Century A. D.) sold many men as slaves to Mlecchas. One cannot help blaming the British Indian Govern ment for the Assam Labour and Emigration Act ( VI of 1901 ) whereby a modified form of serfdom or slavery was legalised for the benefit of the tea planters of Assam, Bengal and other provinces and by sections 168–169 of which poor indentured labourers who were induced to labour on the sumptuous monthly wages of five rupees were liable to be sentenced to fine or in

default to imprisonment, if they left off the work to which by agreement they were tied down in unhealthy districts and unhealthier surroundings. 

Kāt. (725 ) provides that 819 if a woman who is not a slave marries a slave she becomes a slave since her husband is her lord and is dependent on his master. If a person buys or sells a brāhmaṇa woman 850 as a slave the king should annul that transaction and all persons ( concerned in it) should be fined by him and the same holds good in the case of a woman of a respectable family who took shelter with a person and was made a slave by him or transferred by him to another as a 

slave (Kāt. 726–727). The punishment of first amercement is prescribed for a person who has sexual intercourse with the nurse of his child or with another woman who is not a slave and the wife of his attendant as if she were a slave; and a fine of two hundred paṇas is provided in case a master who is not in difficulties and is well-off desires to sell a female slave who is faithful and weeps bitterly (being unwilling to leave him). Nār. VIII. 40 provides that if a slave leaves his master and goes over to another saying 'I am your slave' that would not help the slave, as his former owner would be entitled to claim him back. Uśanas states 851 that a guru ( elderly person), a sapinda, a brāhmaṇa and persons of the lowest castes (capdalas &c.) cannot be made slaves, nor can any one of the higher castes who is superior in learning be the slave of one of the same caste.

SAMVID-VYATIKRAMA AND OTHER TITLES 

( Violation of compacts or conventions) 

Nār. ( XIII. 1 ) employs the expression samayasyānapākarma. Manu VIII. 5 employs the first expression. Manu (VIII. 218-219) has both names in view, when he says 'I shall now declare the rules applicable to those who violate samayas (conventions ). He who having entered into a compact (samvid) under (the sanction of) an oath with the inhabitants of a village or a district or with a group of traders or other persons breaks it through greed should be banished from the kingdom by the king.' In Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1.2 and II. 4, 8. 13 the word 

samaya ' 852 is employed in the sense of 'convention or accept od doctrine'. The same word is also used in the sense of 'agreement' as in Yaj. I. 61 ( gāndharvaḥ samayānmithaḥ). In this title it means the acceptance of a certain rule or convent ion arrived at by many', as explained by 853 Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 219. It signifies a local or caste usage or convent ion made by groups of people ( such as guilds and corporations ) binding on all members that form or join the several groups. The Amarakosa holds that ācāra and sarvid are among the several meanings of samaya. Medhātithi explains that, if the inhabitants of a village come to a decision that they would oppose the inhabitants of a neighbouring village who were indulging in grazing their cattle in the pastures of the former village or diverting the watercourses and that if in doing so there was a riot or a suit were filed before the king, all should

be of one mind, that any one of those who encouraged this decision would be liable to be punished if he backed out of it through some inducement offered by the headman of the other village. Nār. XIII. 1 explains that samaya means the rules (or conventions ) settled among heretics, naiyamas 854 and the like. Yaj. II. 192 and Nar. XIII. 2 provide that the conventions of guilds, naigamas, heretics, srenis, pigas, ganas and in towns and districts should be enforced by the king and their traditional mode of conducting their business should be protected. Some remarks have already been made on guilds and corporations above (pp.156-57 notes 196-198). Vide also H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 66-69 for the guilds and corporations and the meanings of words like $reni, pūga, gana eto. Some further informa tion is added here. The Sm. C. (II. p. 223) has a very 855 interes ting note illustrating the various conventions of several groups and its remarks are copied verbatim by the V. P. pp. 332-333. It says: 'Even heretics have certain rules made for the benefit of their monasteries. Among naigamas there is a practice that those who disregard messages brought by servants wearing a specific jacket (as a uniform) should be fined. Srenis are guilds of craftsmen such as weavers. They have rules that certain articles are to be sold only by a certain guild and by no other. Pūgas are groups of elephant riders and horse riders.' Vrāta is defined by Kāt. as a body of persons armed with various weapons, while the Mahabhasya on Panini V.2.21 (uratena jivati) explains it as a group of men of several castes and several occupations who make a living by relying on their formidable bodies'. Acc. to the Mit. heretics are those like the Bauddhas who do not regard the Veda as authoritative, Gapa means, acc. 

854. नैगम is defined by पतिशम्मत as follows: पौरुषेयतया वेदं प्रामाण्य (वेद. प्रामाण्य !) प्रवदन्ति ये । तेषां वैशेषिकादीनां नैगमाख्या प्रकीर्यते ॥q. by व्यव. नि. p. 13. But this sense is not appropriate here. The same work (p. 14) quotes कात्यायनाs definition which is more appropriate 'नानापौरसमाज नेगमाख्यः प्रकीर्तितः।।

to Mit. an assemblage of armed persons subsisting by follow ing one occupation', while Kāt. (680) says it is a corporation of brahmanas. In the Rajat. II. 132 reference is made to corpora tions of purohitas at temples and tirthas ( sacred places ). The Sm. C. states that among pūgas and vrātas there is a convention that they must go to battle all together and not separately. Among ganas there is a usage that the lobes of the ear (of a child) are to be pierced on the 5th day or in the fifth year from birth. Among mahājanas in a settlement of brāhmaṇas there is a convention that a brāhmaṇa repairing to them for collecting fees to be paid to his teacher (at the close of Vedic study ) should be honoured (i. e, should be paid some contribution). In certain districts there is a usage that either the seller or the buyer should keep in his hand it of the price (probably for finding out whether the article is useful for the purpose in hand and resiling from the bargain if it is not ). In forts or capitals there is a rule that corn taken out of it by a person with him when going out elsewhere should not be sold by him. In villages there is a rule that in pastures no digging would be allowed. In the hamlets inhabited by abhiras there is a convention that for adultery by a male or female there is to be no fine. It does credit to the ancient writers on dharmaśāstra that they were tolerant enough to require the king, whatever his own religious persuasion might be, to honour and enforce the usages of even herstice among themselves. The only requirement was that the enforcement of their usages must not be opposed to the interest of the country or the capital and must not cause commotion and must not be plainly immoral 856 (Nār, XIII. 4-5 and 7 and Medhatithi on Manu VIII. 220). Yāj. (II. 188–192 ) lays down the following rules : there should be a committee of two, three or five, acc. to Bṛ. ) 857 to look after the business of the guilds &c. ( called kāryacintaka ) who should be religious, pure, not covetous and all members should carry out what they decide upon; when the committee members approach the king on some business of their guild he should bestow on them gifts and

honour them. Whatever is obtained by any one sent on the business of the group must be handed over by him to the heads of the group ( also Bṛ. in 8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 349 verse 22 ) 858 and if he does not do so he should be fined eleven times as much, Whoever goes against the heads of the group that are working for its benefit should be punished in the first amercement ( by the group itself, acc. to Sm. C. II. p. 224). Kat. (677) states the general rule that whatever is obtained (by the committee or advisers of the group ) or is saved by them or whatever debts are incurred by them for their group and whatever they obtain through the king's favour should be shared equally by all (members of the group). Kat. ( 674-675 ) provides that whatever debt was professedly incurred by the committee for the group but was misappropriated by them or applied to their individual purposes must be paid by them and that those who subsequently join the groups already formed become equally entitled to the property and liable for the debts previously acquired or incurred. Manu VIII. 220 and Br. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 348 v. 14 ) provide a fine of six niṣkas of four suvarpas each (or six niṣkas and four suvarnan) for him who falls out with his associates. Kat. (671) provides that that member of a group) who opposes what is reasonable, who gives no soope to (i. e. obstructs or persistently interrupts ) a speaker (in a meeting of the group ) or who speaks absurdly should be made to pay the first amercement. Yāj. II. 187 prescribes forfeiture of all property and banishment for him who misappropriates the property of the group or corporation or who violates the conventions made by the group (or the king ). As stated by the Mit, this and other sentences depended upon the nature and gravity of the offence and the capacity of the offender 859 

Krayavikrayānusaya (repentance after purchase or sale ). Manu VIII. 222 and Kaut. II. 15 regard this as one title of law. But Nār. (XI and XII ) splits this into two titles viz. vikriyāsampradana (non-delivery of a thing after it is sold for a price ) and bitvārusaya (repentance after buying). Manu states the general rule that whenever a person after buying

or selling anything repents of having done so, be inay return or take back that thing within ten days. Nār. XI. 2 states that property is of two kinds in this world viz. movable and immovable and that all property is designated as panya (saleable ) in rules about purchase and sale. According to Yaj. 11. 254, Nār. XI. 4-5, Viṣṇu Dh, S. V. 127 860), if a man sells property and does not deliver it to the purchager, he should be made to deliver it to the parchaser together with profits (between the time of sale and delivery ) and if it is movable together with the price of profits arising 8 from it ( such as milk in the case of a cow). Vigṇu Dh. S. V. 128 prescribes a fine of 100 panas against the vendor. Kaut. III. 15 prescribes a fine of 12 paṇas against the vendor who after selling a thing does not deliver it and also against a buyer who having pur chased does not take delivery of it, except when the thing itself is detective or is lost by act of king or theft or by fire or flood or unless the transaction was for inadequate price or brought about in distress. 862 If the article sold is not deliver ed by the vendor after demand by the vendee and it is injured, destroyed by fire or stolen, the loss will fall on the vendor (Nar. XI. 6, Viṣnu Dh. 8. V. 129, Yāj. II. 256 ). These rules apply when the vendor does not feel repentance for having sold the thing, but if he feels repentance then Manu VIII. 222 will apply and the vendor may pay back the price and recover the article within ten days 863 from the sale. Kāt. (684) provides the same rule. No one, either buyer or vendor, can rescind the sale after ten days and if any one uses force in

recovering the article sold or bought after that period the king should fine him 600 panas. Manu VII. 228 extends these rules about repentance and recovery within ten days to all transactions whatever. Kāt. ( 685 ) prescribes that the period of ten days for repentance is allowed to vendors and vendees only in the case of land, and that the period is 12 days when the parties to sale of land are sapiṇdas of one another and that in other cases the period is even shorter. 864 Yāj. II. 257, Nār. XI. 7-8, Bṛ. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 350 verse 4) provide that when a vendor having sold a thing to one man for a price received sells it to another or having concealed the defects of an article sells it as free from defects he should be made to return double the price to the purchaser and a fine equal to double the price to the king. $65 The above rules apply where the purchaser has paid the price, but if there is a mere agree ment and no price is paid, then the vendor or vendee is guilty of no wrong if he resiles from the bare agreement to sell or buy unless they have made an express stipulation that the agree ment cannot be rescinded (Nār. XI. 10). When at the time of the agreement for sale, the vendee pays something by way of ear pest, then if the sale goes off through the fault of the vendor, the latter has to return to the vendee double of the earnest; 866 but if the purchaser does not finally take it he loses the thing and also the earnest. Nār. XII. 1 prescribes that when a vendee after having purchased a thing for a price repents of the pur chase that is the title of law called 'rescission of purchase.' Nār. XII. 2 prescribes that if the purchaser thinks that he has made a bad bargain he may return the thing purchased to the vendor on the same day in an undamaged condition (and may receive back the price paid); but if he returns it on the 2nd or 3rd day after the purchase (including the day of purchase ) he will have to lose respectively one-thirtieth or one-fifteenth of the price and after the third day he cannot return the thing at all (Nār. XII. 3), But Yaj. II. 177 and Nār. XII. 5-6 lay down

the following periods for examination of things purchased, viz. one, three, five, seven, ten days, half a month and one month respectively in the case of iron (and clothes), milch cattle, beasts of burden, jewels (precious stones, pearls and corals), all Borts of grain, a male slave and a female slave. It must be supposed that these verses contain exceptions to the general rule in Manu VIII. 22% cited above. Kaut. (III. 15) allows only one night, three nights, five nights and seven nights for repentance to traders, husbandmen, cowherds, the mixed castes and higher castes and provides that where the articles sold are perishable a very short time only may be allowed. The above rules apply only when the purchaser made no examination at the time of purchase. Nār. 867 XII. 4 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 350 verse 3) recommend that a purchaser should himself closely examine an article before buying it and also show it to others in order to find out its defects and good qualities and provide that when he has approved of an article after close examination he cannot return it to the vendor. Vyāga provides that hides, fuel, bricks, yarn, grain, intoxicants, fluids, gold, inferior metals (like lead and tin) and other wealth should be carefully examined then and there i. e. when once bought after close examination none of these can be returned even if some defect 868 is found therein. Nār. (XII, 5-6) cited above contains exceptions to this. Nār. XII. 7 gives an example of a purchase being not liable to be rescinded when & defective article is purchased with open eyes viz. a worn garment which is soiled with dirt and is in ragged condition cannot be returned to the vendor if it was in that state at the time of the purchase i. e. the maxim'caveat emptor' applies. If a purchaser does not take delivery of the thing sold to him, the vendor may sell it again to another 869 and if the thing is lost through aot of God or the king the loss falls on the buyer alone (Yaj. II. 255, Nār. XL. 9). Kat. (692) pro vides 870 that what has been sold by a lunatic or an intoxicated

person or through intimidation or for an inadequate price or by. one who is dependent or by an idiot should be relinquished by the purchaser; it still belongs to the seller. Kāt. (705–706) lays down a novel rule to find out what is adequate or inade quate price. What a71 is decided by the neighbours assembled together, who know (the land &o. and its value) and who are afraid of committing sin, as the price of fields, gardens, houses and the like, of bipeds and quadrupeds, is declared to be the proper price; a price which is less or more than it by one-eighth is declared to be improper; what is sold for an improper price may be annulled even after a hundred years. Kat. (704) states that when the owner of a field absconds to gether with the surety 872 for the payment of the land tax, the judges of the court may order a sale for recovery of the tax and that such a sale may be set aside up to ten years and a com promise or exchange up to three generations, if it is inequitable. Bhāradvāja provides that when taxes are not paid both by the tax-payer and his surety even when called upon to do so, then the king may order a charge on the land or sale of the land. 

Uktalābha is defined as a conditional sale, where a man borrows only a portion of the proper price of a land and stipulates that he would return the money on a certain day and that if he did not do so his ownership over the land would come to an end. 873 Kāt. (711) adds that a sale of the uktalābha kind will be valid if it is for more than half ( the proper price of the land ), provided more than ten years have elapsed (after

Kat: (71%) further 875 prescribes that the unpaid purchase money carries compound interest after demand if no time is fixed for payment, but, if a time is fixed, then only the balance has to be paid up to the end of that period. Bp. provides that in all sales, the sale deed should mention the wells and trees (on the land), the water and ways and that the crops, trees and fruits, wells, tanks and house standing on the land sold would belong to the vendor if they are not put down in the deed of sale, 876 According to Harita the rules of sales are to be extended to exchanges. 877 

From the Rājatarangini VI. 41 it appears that a fraudulent purchaser, who, by means of the heavy bribe of 1000 dinārus, induced the officially authorized scribe to include a well in the sale of a house when it was intended to be excluded from it, was banished from the country by the king, his property being confiscated and given over to the cheated vendor.

Definitions of sale, exchange &c. 

495 

The Vyavahāranirpaya, after quoting Bṛ. and Vyāsa, very lucidly explains what is meant by sale, purchase, exchange &o. Gold and the like which a man desires to render or pay is called price, while land, house and the like are said to be 'panya' (saleable thing ). Purchage means acoeptance of a thing pre coded by the offering of a price (either paid or agreed to be paid); sale is the acceptance of a price preceded by the offering of a saleable thing. Parivștti or parivartana is the acceptance of an article for an article of the same kind; if there is a disparity in value between the two articles exchanged the exchange is called ' rwvakraya '; when there is an exchange of two articles of different kinds but of the same value it is called vininaya. 878 The Vyavahāranirṇaya makes elaborate provi sions for sale of land at the order of the king for non-payment of land tax. It quotes Prajapati (p. 350 ) to the effect that the purchaser at such a sale must offer half or at least one-fourth of the real price of the field and that the original owner could get back his property sold for the royal dues by paying the full price to the purchaser up to three generations. Other elaborate rules on the same subject are passed over here for reasons of space. These provisions indicate that ownership in cultivated fields belonged to individuals and that the State had only the right to levy taxes. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 865-869 and Kāt, quoted above ( on p. 196 ) for a discussion of the theory of the State's ownership of all lands. Taking into consideration the Pūrvamimāṁsā texts, the Vyavahāramayūkha and the verses of Kāt, and others it appears that the State was deemed to be the owner of all lands as a general proposition, but that where individuals or bodies of persons had been in long possession of lands that they cultivated, the ownership of the State was qualified and restricted only to the recovery of a tax or share

of crops and that individuals and groups that had cultivated lands in their possession were regarded practically as owners of the land subject to the liability to pay land tax and to the right of the State to sell the land for non-payment of tax. The Vyavahāranirnaya quotes Bp. and another smrti text that sūdras, persons excommunicated for grave sins (patita), cāndālas and desperate characters cannot be allowed to possess the lands of a brābmaṇa by sale, partition or in lieu of wages; 879 the same work further quotes Vyāsa, Bhāradvāja and Br. that when land is sold there is a right of pre-emption in favour of full brothers, sapiṇdas, samanodakas, sagotras, neighbours, creditors and one's co-villagers in order. 880 

Gifts of immovables were looked upon in very ancient times with disfavour, though they were made even in the times of the Upaniṣads. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 740-41. But sales of land must have been rarer still in ancient times owing to the patriarchal and joint family systems. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 quotes a verse forbidding the sale of immovable property : 881 but sales of lands are mentioned in many copperplate grants. Vide Paharpur plate grant of Gupta year 159 i. e. 478-79 A. D. in E. I vol. 20 p. 59 (where one kulgāvāpa of land is stated to have been sold for two dināras to a brāhmaṇa and his wife named Rāmi by the city council for the provision of the worship with sandal-wood paste &o. of the divine arhats at a vihāra), E. I. vol. 17 p. 345 (grant of the time of Kumāra gupta I in Gupta year 113), the Damodarpur plates ( E. I. vol. 15 p. 113), Faridpur plates (Ind. Ant. vol. 39 p. 193), E. I. vol. 18 p. 74. From these records of the 5th and 6th centuries A. D. it appears that land was owned by private individuals or by

joint families or by the village community or by the king and there was a fixed procedure when land was to be sold, that the purchaser approached the District Officers who consulted the pustapālas that kept a record of titles and that the villa gers and headmen were consulted and asked to mark off the land to be sold. It appears that the smṣtis recommended that sales should be clothed in the formalities of gifts, probably because gifts were frequent and sales were not. A smrti quoted by the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 114) states land passes (i. e. is trans ferred) with the assent of the villagers, the agnatic relations, the neighbours, the co-sharers and with the offering of gold and water.' The Mit. explains that these 882 are not absolutely neces sary formalities of a sale, but that they are recommended for the sake of greater caution and convenience, that the absent of the villagers is to be secured for the publication of the transaction of sale, as a text says that acceptance, particularly of im movables, should be made openly, that the neighbours' assent should be secured for preventing boundary disputes, that the assent of agnates and co-sharers is desired for making it easy to complete the transaction, that it does not follow that without the assent of these the sale of land is not valid or complete. Water and gold are to be offered because gifts being highly commended, a sale should be clothed outwardly with the same formalities. Vide Dr. P. N. Sen's 'Hindu Jurisprudence' pp. 76–78 for the opposite procedure of the ancient Roman Law that gifts were to be clothed with the formalities of sale. For water and gold in the case of gifts vide above under dattāpradānika. 

Svāmipalavivāda (disputes between the owner of cattle and herdsman who is engaged to look after them). In ancient times this must have been a prominent source of litigation in a predominantly agricultural country like India, Nār. appears to have included this title under vetanasyānapā. karma. Yāj. II. 164, Nār. IX. 11 provide that the cowherd has to bring back to the owner in the evening the cows (and other domestic animals ) handed over to him in the morning by

the owner, after grazing them in the pastures and making them drink water. Manu VIII. 230 says that during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman and during the night on the owner provided they are in the latter's house. When there is no express agreement as to wages Nār. IX, 10 and Bs. (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verse 19 ) prescribe that a cowherd 883 will get as his wages all the milk of the cows tended by him on every eighth day plus a heifer (two years old) every year out of every one hundred cows tended by him or a milch cow with her calf every year for every two hundred cows looked after by him. Manu VIII. 231 provides another method when no wages are fixed by agreement viz. a hired herdsman, who is paid with milk, may milk as hire the best cow out of ten with the consent of the owner. It is the duty of the cowherd to struggle as much as in him lies to protect the cows from accidents and if he is unable to do so he must quickly inform the owner (Nār. IX. 12). Bṛ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verge 20) states 884 that the cowherd shall save cattle from the danger of worms (or reptiles), robbers, tigers and from caverns and pits and that he should try to protect them to the best of his ability, should call out for help or inform his master. If the herdsman does not struggle to protect the cows, nor raise a hue and cry nor inform his master he must make good the value of the cow lost and must pay a fine to the king (Nār. IX. 13). Manu VIII. 232 and 235, Yaj. II. 164-165, Visnu Dh. S. V. 885 137-138, Nār. (IX, 14-15) provide that if a cow or other domestic animal strays or is killed by worms (or reptiles) or slain by dogs (and wild animals) or dies by falling into a pit or by any negligent act of the herdsman, he himself shall make good the loss, if he did not exert bimself to prevent this happening or if goats and sheep are surrounded by wolves and carried away while the herdsman does not hasten to their help he shall bear the res ponsibility for the loss. In these cases the herdsman has also

to pay a fine of 123 panas 38 to the king (Yaj. II. 165). Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 28. 6 makes 887 the herdsman liable to pay the price if an animal in his charge dies or is lost (by theft &c.). Manu VIII. 233, 236, Nār. IX. 16, Vyāsa state exceptions to the above viz. where an animal is carried away 888 by robbers though the herdsman raised a cry, he would not be liable to make good the loss provided he gave information to his master at the proper time (immediately after the animal is carried away) and proper place; or when the herdsman himself is seized or the village is attacked or the country is invaded, the herdsman would not be liable for loss or seizure of any animal under his charge; and also where, while the herd is grazing in a proper order near a forest, a wolf suddenly kills an animal. Manu VIII. 234, Nār. IX. 17 state that when cattle die through act of God or king or die without any fault of kis while in charge of a herdsman, he has to free himself from liability or from the suspicion of himself having 859 carried away surreptitiously the animal by producing before his master their ears, skin, tails, bladders, tendons and yellow bile or by showing their limbs (viz, their characteristic marks). Vyāsa states that if a herdsman, who has received his wages, abandons cattle in an untenanted forest and moves about in the village he should be fined by the king.89 

Yaj. II. 166 provides that a portion of land should be set apart at the discretion of the villagers or that of the king as pasture for cows. Manu VIII. 237, Yāj. II. 167 prescribe

(666) prescribes that the owner of a field (which is near a forest) should construct a high paling before the crops have grown; for animals (or deer) when they have once tasted the sweet 892 ( crops ) can be warded off with difficulty. Manu VIII, 239 = ( Matsya 227.25), Nār. XIV. 41 prescribe that a hedge should be constructed for a field that is near a public way so high that a camel cannot look inside over it or a borge or cattle cannot jump over or so thick that & dog or boar should not be able to thrust its head inside it through holes. Manu VIIL 238 ( = Matsyapurāna 227. 26 ), Yaj. II. 162, Nār. XIV. 40 provide that if a field situated near a village or a pasture or near a public road is not protected by a hedge and cattle straying into it cause loss, the herdsman is not to be held guilty. It is provided by Ap. Dh. S. 11. 11. 28. 5, Manu VIII. 240, Nar. XIV. 28, Kāt. 664-665 that if cattle enter into fields, 893 parks or pastures that are situated near a village or a publio road and are enclosed by a hedge, they may be seized or beaten off, the herdsman is to be fined (a hundred paṇas ). Yaj. II. 159-161, Manu VIII. 241, Nār. XIV. 28-29, Kāt, 667 and others lay down that where cattle enter fields ( not near a village or road) and cause loss, the herdsman is to be fined or whipped, the owner of the cattle is to make good the loss and

pay the fine prescribed and the fines vary 8. g. Ya. II. 159 prescribes fines of 2, 4 and 8 māṣas respectively when a goat or a cow or a she-buffalo strays and causes logs of crops, while Kat. (667) prescribes only pana in the case of cows and sheep and ; in the case of she-buffaloes. Vide Gaut. XII. 19-22 and Kaut. III. 10 also. Those who purposely set cattle to eat or destroy crops were to be punished as thieves (Nār. XIV. 34). 

Ancient India entertained tender feelings for certain animals and in certain circumstances. Nār. XIV. 30, Yāj. II. 163, Manu VIII. 242, Kaut. III. 10 894 and Uśanas provide that cows within ten days after calving, a stud bull, a horse, an elephant, animals let loose in honour of ancestors or deities, and cattle that have strayed from the herd or that have no herdsman to look after them and have met with an accident are to be warded off when causing harm to crops, but the owner is not to be fined. Usanas 895 states that the reason for this leniency is that horses and elephants are protectors of people. Apararka (p. 771 ) explains that this exemption applies only to the king's horses and elephants. Uśanas adds that (owners of) cows should not be fined when they cause some loss at the time of festivals and brāddhas. The great veneration for cows led Uśanas to lay down that he who requires the owner of a cow to re-imburse the loss of crops that are eaten up or destroyed by a cow will find that his pit?s and the gods do not receive the offerings made 896 by him. This is explained by the Par. M. III. p. 385 as referring to crops in fields near a village not enclosed by a hedge and by the Madanaratna to crops eaten at the time of śrāddha. Br., Yāj. II. 161 and Nār. XIV. 38 require the owner of the cow to re-imburse the owner of the crops for the loss as settled by the neighbours. Vide under 'steya' for cases in which there is no offence of theft even if a person takes certain things belonging to another without his permission.

CHAPTER XXII 

SĪMAVIVĀDA ( boundary disputes ). 

This is called kṣetra javivāda 897 (disputes relating to fields ) by Nārada XIV. 1, who defines it as ' dispute with regard to land in which questions about dikes or embankments, the boundaries of fields, ploughed land and fallow land have to be decided.' Nārada's idea appears to be that the word 'simavivāda' in Manu is only illustrative and is a compendious way of mentioning disputes about land in general. According to Kāt. (732) there are six causes 89 of land disputes viz. claiming more land, claim that a person is entitled to less than he possesses, claim to a share, denial of a share, seizing possession when previously there was none, boundary. In all these cases boundaries have directly or indirectly to be settled and there fore all these are included under the topic of simāvivāda. A boundary dispute may relate to the boundaries of a distriot (janapada ), a village, a field and a house. Boundaries, acc. to Nār., may be of five kinds.899 They are described as follows: dvhanni is what is indicated by trees which are like a flag staff. Manu (VII. 246-247) prescribes that trees such as asvattha, the silk cotton, śāla, tāla (palmyra palm ), that have milky juice (like udumbara ) should be planted to indicate boundaries and also bamboo clumps, bushes, reeds &c. A matsyini (lit. having fish) boundary is provided by rivers flowing naturally and full of fish and tortoises or by tanks and reservoirs of water (Manu VIII. 248). A naidhāni boundary is one indicated by concealed signs (just as nidhāna i. e. treasure is concealed in the earth), such as pots filled with chaff, coal, bricks, bones and similar things that the earth does not corrode

Five kinds of boundaries

and are buried inside the earth. Manu (VIII. 250-251 ) enume rates those objects that should be buried in the earth, which would serve to indicate the boundaries of a village or field and which are therefore called concealed (upacchanna) by him. A blayavarjitā (free from .danger) boundary is settled by the agreement of the parties. The fifth kind is the one that is laid down by order of the king. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 351 verse 2) prescribes 900 that at the time of founding a village definite boundaries should be erected or constructed by means of visible or patent (prakāśı) and concealed (upāmāu or upacchanna ) signs and the Sm. C. II. 228 explains that a row of big stones should be employed to indicate the boundary. Bṛhaspati (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 351 verses 3-7) states what patent and concealed boundary marks should be and requires elderly persons to point them out to youths and children who in their turn when old are to point out the boundaries to other youths and in this way traditional knowledge of boundaries may be kept up. Manu (VIIL 252-253) states that in disputes boundaries should be settled in accordance with the visible and concealed signs des cribed above, by reliance on long former enjoyment and by the constant flow of water and that if there be doubt even after observing the signs then the dispute has to be decided on the evi. dence of witnesses. Witnesses could either depose to the marks of boundaries or to the boundaries themselves. Those who could not point out the marks but were to define the boundaries themselves were to follow a certain procedure. Manu VIII. 254 states that the witnesses should be asked about the marks of boundaries in the presence of the litigating parties and groups (or faniilies) of the villagers. The witnesses on being asked were to trace, point out and settle the boundary unani mously, being clad in red garments, wearing red chaplets and being exhorted to depose truly by their spiritual merit 90 and carrying clods of earth on their heads, by reference to mounds or depressions, coals, bones and chaff (buried underground,

in a vessel ), embankments, anthills, platforms of stones or bricks (Manu VIII. 255, 256, Yaj. II. 151, Nar. XIV. 4-6). Vas. 16. 13, Kaut. III 9, Yaj. II. 150, Manu VIII. 258,260, Nar. (XIV.2-3) prescribe that on failure of witnesses of the adjoining villages, neighbours (samanta),92 old men, cowherds husbandmen who plough the fields near the one in dispute, hunters, fowlers, fishermen, snake catchers and foresters should settle the disputed boundary in the presence of the king. The 

Mit. on Yaj.03 II. 153 quotes Kat. (743-745, 51) to show that witnesses were divided into sūmanta, maula, vrddha and uddhrta, each preceding group being superior to the succeeding. The Mit. further says that the neighbours as witnesses are to be arranged in the form of the layers of the petals of a lotus viz. the nearest ones ( saṛsaktaka ) are those most preferred, ( but if this group has faults ) then a second but a more removed group and then a third group still more remote may be examined. Saṅkha-Likhita and Vas.904 16.13-15 prescribe that in boundary disputes the decision depends on neighbours, in the case of conflict of witnesses on documents and then on the old men in the town or village and the guilds. Yaj. II. 152 and Manu VIII 258 require that the neighbours who are to settle the boundary should be four, eight or ten ( even in number) and inhabitants of the same village (if possible), Br. (S. B.E. 33 p. 352 Verse 14 ) requires that the witnesses 905 should know the source of title (to the disputed land), the measurement (in nivartanas, dandas &c.), the length of enjoyment or possession, the names of persons (in possession) and the characteristic geography or lie of the land. The general rule was (as stated by Nar. XIV.9)

A single witness not to settle boundary 

505 

that a single witness however confident he might be (or how over reliable ) should not take upon himself to point out and settle the boundary, since this ( boundary ) dispute being a very important ( difficult ) matter, its decision should rest with many, The Mit. ( on Yāj. II. 152 ), explains that this prohibition holds good only if the single witness is one not accepted by both sides as reliable. But Nār. ( XIV. 10 ) and Bļ. (S. B. E. 906 33 p. 352 verse 11 ) hold that where a single witness accepted by both sides has to settle the boundary (in the absence of more witnesses and in the absence of reliable patent or concealed signs ) he should do so after placing a clod of earth on his head, after being dressed in red robes and wearing red flowers and after observing a fast. If it was a śūdra who was to trace or lay down a boundary Visvarūpa 907 on Yāj. II. 156 quotes a prose passage of Brhaspati that he was to be docked in red pieces of cloth, his face was to be smeared with ashes from a cemetery, a mark was to be made on his chest with five fingers dipped in the blood of a goat and the entrails of the sacrificed goat were to be tied round his neck and he was to hold a clod of earth in the right hand. All this was to impress upon him the gravity of the work and the necessity of doing his best impartially. If no knowing witness or no patent or concealed signs are available the king has himself to settle the boundary between the two villages at his own discretion(Yaj. II. 153, Nār. XIV.11, Manu VIII. 265). He may divide the land between the two villages equally and construct new marks of boundaries, but if the disputed land will be of greater benefit to one village than to the other the king may assign the whole of the disputed land to the former. Manu VIII. 245 prescribes that when there is a boundary dispute between two villages the king should decide it in the month of Jyestha when the embankment (marks) become quite clear ( owing to water being dried up in summer). The decision made by the witnesses or neighbours became final only after the lapse of three weeks if no calamity (from act

of God or king) befell the witnesses (Kat. 751).908 Manu prescribes (VIII. 261) that the boundary settled by witnesses should be fixed by the king (or recorded in a document containing the names of witnesses ). An ancient instance of the fixing of boundaries by two foudatory chiefs is recorded in the Bhumara stone Pillar inscription of the Parivrājaka Mahāraja Hastin and Mahārāja Sarvanātha, who erected a pillar at Ambloda to show the boundary between their territories about 510 A. D. (vide Fleet's Gupta Inscriptions No. 24 p, 110). Vide also E. I. vol. 24 pp. 32-34 for inscriptional evidence about the carrying out of all the details laid down in dharmaśāstra works on the settlement of boundaries. Manu VIII, 263, Yaj. II. 153, Nar. XIV. 7 prescribe the middle amer cement for each one of the sāmantas that falsely settle the boundaries, while Manu (VIII. 257) and Nar. XIV.8 prescribe the first amercement only for other witnesses such as members of corporations and elderly villagers. If through friendship, greed or fear the witnesses who know the facts do not come forward to settle the boundary they are each to be fined in the highest amercement (Kat.909 750). 

Br. (S. B.E. 33 p. 353 verses 19-21) lays down certain interesting rules about alluvion and diluvion. Where a river is the boundary between two villages and the river carries away soil from one village and attaches it to another, the accretion belongs to the village to which it becomes attached, but this is so when the soil carried away has no crops growing on it; if however soil with growing crops is separated from a village and joined to another by a river in flood, the former owner can reap only the crops and the land will belong to the village or field to which it has become attached 910.

Decision of boundaries of fields &c. 

507 

Manu VIII. 262, Yaj. II. 154, Nār. XIV. 12, Kāt. 749 pres cribe that the decision of disputes about the boundaries of fields, wells, tanks, groves and parks, palaces, houses, cottages, temples and channels carrying rain water is to be similarly arrived at by the testimony of witnesses ( sāmantas and others). 

Several rules are laid down by Nār., Bṛ. and Kat. about easements and water-courses. 

Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 verse 24) prescribes that no 911 inter ference should be caused to the manner of the enjoyment of houses ( as regards doors, compounds &c.), to the enjoyment of water and markets in the way in which they had been enjoyed from the time the village or house was established or built. This means, acc. to the Sm. C. II. p. 234 and V. P. p. 363 that if a new mode of enjoyment is started in the case of these after the village was established or the house was built then inter ference may be allowed. Br. (8. B.

Kāt. (752-753) similarly provides 'one should not interfere with the base of the wall, a drain (or waterspout), a balcony, window, watercourse and dwelling house of another. These are not to be added to one's house after the first building of it (so as to cause obstruction or annoyance to another), one should not open a window 913 ( so as to command a view) in the interior of another's house or open a spout (that will drain off

One should construct places (pits) for depositing ordure, urine and filthy water, a fireplace and a pit at a distance of at least two cubits from the walls of other people (his neighbours ) and should not construct these very near to another's house (vide also Bp. S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 354 verses 25-26). 

Bș. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 verse 27) defines a samsarana94 as the road by which men and beasts pass to and fro without let .or hindrance. Kat. (755) calls it catuspatha and defines rūja mūrga as the road by which people are allowed to pass at certain times (and not at all times). Several rules are prescribed by Kautilya and others for obviating nuisances on public roads or near private houses. Bļ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 354 Verse 28) and Kat. (756) provide that roads should not be obstructed by parking 95 carts and the like thereon, that no one should plant anything on a public road, that a man who puts obstruction on the public road, makes pits or plants trees or wilfully voids excrement thereon should be fined a māsaka, and one who does not give 916 precedence on the road to his guru, preceptor or the king should be fined. Manu IX. 282 prescribes the fine of two kārṣāpanas for voiding or dropping ordure on the public road in the absence of distress and requires the wrongdoer to clean the road, but Manu (IX. 283 ) makes an exception in the case of persons diseased, very old men, a pregnant woman and a child, who are not to be fined but only reproved for voiding ordure on the road. Vide Matsya 227. 175-76 for the same two verses. Kauṭ. II. 36917 pres cribes the fine of of a pana for throwing dust on a cart-road and 4 for obstructing it with mud and a fine double of these

for doing the same on a royal road; prescribes a fine of one, two, three or four paṇas respectively for voiding ordure on or near a holy place, or a place whence water is taken, or a temple or the king's buildings and exempts from fine such persons as those mentioned in Manu IX. 283. Kāt. (758-759 ) provides 918 that he who defiles a tānk, a garden or holy water (or ghats ) by throwing filthy matter (ordure &c.) therein should be made to remove the filth and fined the first amercement and also one who pollutes by washing soiled clothes in holy and purifying sacred places (ghats &c.) established by great or saintly persong. Yāj. II. 155 prescribes the first, the highest and middling amercements respectively for making breaches in the boundary (between two or more fields ), for ploughing a field beyond the boundary of one's field and for depriving a man of his field by intimidation and the like. Vide also Vispu Dh. S. V. 172 and Saṅkha-Likhita 919 who prescribe a fine of 1008 paṇas for transgressing ( the whole of) the boundary (of a field). Manu VIII. 264 ( = Matsya 227, 30) provides a fine of 200 papas for seizing another's field, garden or house through inadver tance, but 500 for seizing any one of these by intimidation. Nār. XIV, 13-14 and Kāt, ( 760–761 ) state 920 that the fruits and flowers of those trees that grow on the boundary between two fields should be declared ( by the Judge ) as joint between the owners of the two fields and that if the branches of trees grow ing in one man's field spread over another man's field that man should be understood to be the owner of the trees and branches ( together with fruit &c.) in whose field the trees are born (have taken root).

A setu (watercourse ) is said by Nār. (XIV. 18 ) to be of two kinds, viz. that which is dug ( kheya ) into the soil in order to drain off excessive water and that which is constructed (bandhya) as an embankment to prevent water from flowing away. Yaj. II. 156 and Nār. XIV. 17 provide that a setu made by the owner of one field in the neighbouring field should not be forbidden by the owner of that field, if the loss of soil it causes (to the latter ) is small as compared with the great benefit that it may confer. Nār. ( XIV. 20-21 ) and Yaj. II. 157 prescribe that one should make a dike or watercourse on an other's land with the permission of that man or with the permis sion of the king as otherwise he cannot reap the benefit thereof. Kāt. (762-63) provides a similar rule about the repairs to a house or garden or tank made by a stranger without the owner's or the king's permission. It is stated by Nār. ( XIV. 23-25 ) that when the owner of a field is unable ( to cultivate it) or is dead or is not heard of, if a stranger cultivates the field without objection from any body, the stranger shall enjoy the produce of the field, that if the owner (or his son) returns while the field is being tilled by a stranger, he can get his field back on repayment to the stranger of all the money expended on making the land ( ready for crops ). If the owner is unable to return the expenses, the stranger may retain th of the produce every year for eight years giving 3th to the owner every year and should hand over the field to the owner when the 8th year arrives. Yāj. II. 158 and Vyāsa provide that if a person takes a field from the owner on rent for cultivation, but gives up the cultivation after slightly ploughing it and does not employ someone else to complete the cultivation, then he should be made to pay the produce that would have been recovered from the field if properly cultivated and also should be fined and the field may be taken from him and given to another tonantu

## 23 Vākpāruṣya and Daṇḍapāruṣya

CHAPTER XXIII 

VAKPĀRUSYA AND DANDAPARUSYA 

( Abuse and defamation; assault) 

Vakpāruṣya, dandapārusya, steya, strisangrahana, sāhasa are five titles out of 18 that are concerned with what may be called criminal matters or crimes in modern nomenclature. Vide under sāhasa below. 

Nār, XVIII. 1 defines vākpārusya as 'abusive words that loudly proclaim censure of another's country, caste, family and the like and that cause mental pain or offence to that man. Kat. (768) defines it as 92 consisting in making the sound 'hum' (of defiance) before another or coughing before him, of imitating or uttering before another whatever is censurable according to popular notions. Nār. (XVIII. 2-3) says that abuse is of three kinds, niṣthura ( reproachful such as calling a man a fool or a rogue), atlila (obscene or insulting), tiura (mercilessly severe such as charging a man with such grave sins as brāhmana-murder or drinking liquor ) and that the punishment for each later one is more severe than for each preceding one. Examples of the abuse of country, caste and family are respectively 'the Gaudas are quarrelsome', 'brāhmaṇas are extremely greedy', 'persons of the Viśyāmitra gotra commit cruel deeds'. Br. (S. B. E, vol, 33 p. 355 verses 2-4) divided vākpārusya into three kinds viz. lowest ( when the country, caste or family of a person is abused or sinfulness is ascribed without specifying any definite act), middling (speaking that the abuser will have sexual inter course with the mother or sister of the abused or ascribing the commission of upapātakas 923 or minor sins to the abused ), highest (charging him with taking forbidden food or drink or mercilessly exposing or ascribing the grave sins to a person ). Various fines are prescribed in the smrtis that depend upon the above distinctions and also on the castes of the abuser and the

abused. For example, Manu VIII. 267 (=Nar.XVIII. 15-Mataya 227. 66) prescribes the punishments of 100 paṇas, 150 or 200 paṇas, corporal punishment respectively against a kṣatriya or a vaisya or a śūdra abusing a brāhmaṇa and conversely Manu VIII. 268 ( = Nār. XVIII. 16 ) provides that a brāhmaṇa oalum niating a kṣatriya, vaiśya or sūdra should respectively be fined 50, 25 or 12 panas. In the case of the abuser and the abused being of the same varna the fine for ordinary abuse is 12 papas, but double of this if the abuse is, according to 

Manu VIIL 269 ( = Nar.XVIII. 17), foul (relating to mother, sister &c.). Vide Yaj. II. 206-207, Visnudharmasutra. V.,35. From the remarks of the Sm. C. and the Madanaratna it appears that these discriminating provisions 924 based on the caste 925 and the agcription of minor or grave sins had become a dead letter and were not being enforced by the kings in India by the 12th century A. D. at least. One or two matters, however, may be noted. Manu VIII. 268-272 and 274 are the same as Nar. XVIII. 16-17, 22-24. Even the truth of an imputation926 afforded no complete exemption e. 8. if a person angrily calls & man a thief (who was once convicted of it) or speaks of him as blind or cripple, the former would be fined at least one karsapana (Manu VIII. 274 = Nar. XVIII. 18). Kaut. (III. 18) provides in this case three papas 92n as fine and Visnudharmasatra (V.37) two panas. When the

imputation is false all provide for a fine double of that pro vided in case the imputation is true. Ironic praise of a man (such as describing one who is blind of one eye as one endowed with a beautiful eye) is made punishable by Kaut. (III. 18). To warn 928 a man against associating with a person who is guilty of a grave sin or of theft does not entail punishment if the truth of the imputation be established (Kāt. 776). Aco. to Kaut. and Kāt. (775) the king was to award only half the fine prescribed if the accused said 'what I uttered in abuse was done through ignorance, carelessness, rivalry or friendship; I shall not again do so'929. A person who abuses a king doing his duty was to have his tongue cut off or forfeited all his property (Nar. XVIII. 30, Yāj. II. 302). Ap. II. 10. 27. 14 prescribed for a sūdra that abused any one of the three higher castes leading a religious life the punishment of the cutting of the tongue 930. 

Dandapūruṣya (assault). Kaut. II. 19 begins his treatment of this topic by saying that it comprises touching, threatening to strike and actually striking another 931. Nār. XVIII. 4 defines it as injuring the limbs of another with the hand, foot, weapon or other means (such as stones) or defiling or causing pain by (bringing) ashes and similar substances in contact with another. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 212 explains that even causing injury to animals and trees would fall under this title. Nār. XVIII. 5-6 provide that assault may be of three kinds viz. mild, middling and highly punishable according as a person merely makes preparations to assault or attacks without any qualm or causes a wound and that this crime can further be divided into three kinds according as the object attacked is low in value or middling or high. A verse from the Parisista ( quoted by Sm. C. II. p. 327 and V. P. p. 370) states' whoever causes pain or draws blood, wounds, breaks, cuts off, pierces (the limbs or bodies) of living beings is guilty of daṇdapāruṣya'. According to Bs. (S. B.

[Vol. 

1) dandapāruṣya 932 consists in striking (a person) with the hand, with a stone, a club, ashes, mud, dust or a weapon. The Mit. on Yāj. IL 212 following Nar. XVIII. 7-12 lays down certain propositions about both abuse and assault. A person who does not return abuse or does not assault when abused or assaulted, deserves to be commended ; if he returns the abuse or assaults in return, the person who began the quarrel is to be dealt with more severely than the other. When two persons 933 attack each other and there are no means for finding who began the quarrel equal punishment is to be awarded to both; but when two quarrel he who began the quarrel or he who persists longer than the other is to be fined more than the other party and lastly if men of the lowest 934 castes such as svapāka, meda, cũndala, hunters, elephant riders, vrātyas and dāsas ( slaves) assault respectable men and ācāryas then they are to be punished ( whipped) by good men then and there, but if such punishment is not possible, then the king should award corporal punishment (of various kinds according to the nature of the crime) and should not take fines from them, since they are the foulest among men and their wealth also is foul. Kāt. (783 ) and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 359 verse 15 ) are to the same effect. The several smrtis lay down various punish ments for various kinds of assaults but no useful purpose will be served by going into details. Kāt. 935 ( 786 ) provides that just as in abuse punishnients depend on the castes of the abuser and the abused 80 also in assaults higher punish ment is to be awarded if the attacker is of a lower caste than the person attacked or lower punishment if the person attacked is of a lower caste. Manu VIII. 286 and Uśanas 936 lay down that the punishment for the offence should be commensurate with

Punishment for assault

the pain or injury caused by the offender to a man or beast. A few examples may be set out. Probably the oldest reference to fines for assault in Sanskrit literature is contained in the Taittiriya Samhita 937 II. 6. 10. 2: 'He who threatens to strike a brāhmaṇa shall be fined with a hundred (cows or niṣkas ? ), he who strikes a brāhmaṇa shall be fined with a thousand; he who draws blood from him shall not behold the pitss for as many years as there are particles of dust mixed with the blood that falls on them'. 

This passage is interpreted in Jai. III. 938 4. 17 as being a recom mendatary injunction ( puruṣārtha ) to all at all times to desist from assaulting a brāhmaṇa. Gaut. ( 21. 20-22 ) and Manu XI. 206–207 appear to take the Tai. S. passage differently and refer the figures of 100 and 1000 to years. Kaut. III. 19 prescribes various fines for various kinds of assaults. Br. (S. B.E. 33 p. 357 verses 2,3 and 7 ) says that if a person throws ashes or the like at another or beats him with the hand the fino should be one māsa, but if he strikes with a brick, stone or stick the fine should be two māsakas ; this however applies when both are of the same caste, but if he assaults a woman who is another's wife or a person of a higher caste, the fine may be higher and higher. For one who bruises the skin of another or draws blood by assault the fine is one hundred paṇas, and for him who causes a wound by removing some flesh the fine is six māsakas and he who causes breaking of bones should be banished (Manu VIII. 284 = Nār. XVIII. 29). Kāt. prescribes the highest amerce ment for cutting off the ear, the lip, the nose, the foot, the eye, the tongue, the penis, the hand, and the middle amerce ment for causing injury (or wounding). Gaut. XII. 1, Kaut. III. 19, Manu VIII. 939 279, Yaj. II. 215, Br. provide the punishment of the cutting of that limb with which a sūdra strikes a person of the three higher castes. And the Mit. on Yāj. II. 215 applies by analogy the same rule to a vaisya striking a ksatriya. Manu VIII. 280 extends the same punishment to a śndra for

merely raising the hand or a club to strike one of a higher caste. Manu VIII. 281-283 (Nar. XVIII. 26-28 ) provide that a person of a low caste defiantly sitting on the same seat with one of a higher caste was to be first branded on the waist and then banisbed or bis hips were to be gashed ( in such a way that he might not die ), that a sūdra defiantly spitting on the body of a brāhmana had his lips cut off or a sūdra voiding urine or fæces on a brāhmaṇa had those offending limbs cut off, or a sūdra defiantly seizing a brāhmaṇa by the hair or the feet or beard or neok or testicles would have both his hands cut off. If several conspire and strike a person who is alone, each one was to be sentenced to twice the punishment prescribed for the offence (Yāj. II. 221, Kaut. 940 III. 19, Visnu Dh. 8. V. 73). Kaut. II. 19, Manu VIII. 287, Yaj. II. 222, Br., Kāt. 787, Visnu Dh, S. V. 75-76 provide that the king should make an offender pay a fine and also the expenses of medical treatment and diet till the wound is healed up and the person attacked is able to do his usual work (vide note 613 above). For mischief to property 941 and for killing or maim ing animals, Kaut., Manu, Yājñavalkya and others provide various fines. For example, Kauṭ. III. 19 prescribes that when property of small value is destroyed by a man he should be punished with fine equal to the value of the article and should be made to restore the article or its value to the owner; but in the case of articles of substantial value the fine is double of the value. Manu VIII. 288 is of similar import. Yāj. II. 223 provides varying fines if a person wrongfully causes damage to a wall by knocking it (with a club), or pierces it or divides it into two or demolishes it and makes the offender pay to the owner the cost of restoring it. Manu. VIII. 296–298, Yāj. II. 225-226 prescribe fines for causing death or injury to animals of small value (such as goats) and big animals like elephants, horses and cows. Yāj. II. 227-229, Kaut. III. 19, and Kāt. 793 provide fines for causing loss by injuring or felling trees, shrubs and creepers. Yāj. I. 214 holds 92 that if a person throws mud,

Right of private defence

dust or saliva or filthy things on another or strikes with his feet, he should not be fined if he is under the influence of intoxicants at the time or is not in his right mind or does it through mistake, while Kauṭ. III. 19 prescribes half of the usual fine in such cases. .. 

An important question is how far the right of private defence of person or property was recognised by the dharma śāstra works. This subject has partly been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 148–151 in connection with an ātatāyin (a desperate man) who is an incendiary or a poisoner or is armed with a weapon, is a robber, one carrying away another's wife or seizing by force ( a field ). Although there is great diversity of views about killing a brāhmaṇa ātatūyin, there is no difference of opinion as to repelling with force culminating even in death an ātatāyin of any other caste. Gaut. VII. 25 allows even a brāhmaṇa to arm himself when his life is in danger. 943 Baud. Dh, S. II. 944 2. 80, Manu VIII. 348-349 lay down that brāhmaṇas and vaiśyas may oppose with force when they are prevented from doing their religious duties by felong or when there are disturbances caused by invasion or the like, for saving their own lives, for preventing the seizure of their cows or other wealth or for protecting women or brāhmaṇas. The Mit. 945 on Yāj. II. 286 remarks that these rules of Manu are applicable when there is no time to report to the king or when delay in opposing violence will mean loss or ruin. According to Kāt. 946 ( 800 ) no blame attaches to a man who kills wicked men that are about to kill another, but when they have desisted from their attempt, they should be arrested and not killed. Aparārka (on Yāj. III. 227) remarks that persons are to be regarded as ātatāyin while they are about to set fire or to kill or they are in the act of setting fire or killing and the like, that where it is not possible to prevent them from doing what

they intend to do except by killing them there only the texts allow killing ; but that where it is possible to prevent them by merely wounding them with a weapon or stick, killing them would be an offence. 947 Medhātithi 947 a on Manu VIII. 348 differs from this and allows the killing of a desperado even after he has carried out his purpose and not only when he is about to carry it out or is in the act of carrying it out. The view of the Mit. on Yaj. II. 21 is that one has a right to oppose and kill another in self-defence, in defence of women and other weak people, who cannot defend themselves against a murderous or violent attack and that even if a wrongdoer of the brāhmaṇa caste was killed in the exercise of such right there is no punish ment at the hands of the king and the prāyaścitta (for killing a brāhmaṇa) is a light one. Similarly a man can kill with impunity animals having claws, horns or fangs or horses or elephants if they attack a person (Kat. 805 q. by Sm. C. II. p. 316).

## 24 Steya

CHAPTER XXIV 

STEYA (theft). 

In the Rg. there is frequent mention of taskara, stena and tāyu. In Rg. VI. 28. 3 the sage 948 says 'may the cows not disappear from us, may a thief not injure them! In Rg. VIII. 29. 6 it is said "Pūṣan guards the ways and knows of concealed treasures as a thief does! From Rg. X. 4.6 it appears that thieves were desperate and bound people with ropes and (from Rg. I. 191. 5 ) that thieves (taskaras ) appeared at night. Tāyu (thief) occurs in Rg. I. 50.2, IV. 38. 5, VI. 12. 5 and is an Indo-Iranian word. The word 'stena'occurs in Rg. VI. 28.7 and means 'one who is a cattle-lifter'. Rg. VIII. 67. 14 indicates that a stena was bound with ropes (when caught). In Rg. VII. 55. 3 the dog is asked to run after a stena and a taskara, the first being probably a thief (who secretly carries away pro perty) and the second a thief who openly carries it away. In the Vāj. 9484 S. XI. 79 (=Tai. S. IV. 1.10.2) we have the malimlu in addition to stena and laskaru. Atharvaveda IV, 3 contains charms against wolves, tigers and thieves (taskaras ). 

Steya is distinguished from sāhasa in Manu VIII. 332, Kaut. III. 17, Nār. XVII. 12 and other works as stated under sahasa below. Kāt. 810 defines 9486 it as 'depriving a man of his wealth either clandestinely or openly and either by night or by day'. Nār. XVII. 17 defines it as 'deprivation of wealth by various means from people that are asleep, careless or intoxicated'. It may be of three kinds according to the value of the thing stolen viz. trifling (when earthen-ware, seats, cots, wood, hides, grass, beans in pods or cooked food is stolen) or middling (when the theft relates to clothes except silken

ones, animals except cows and bulls, metals except gold, rice and barley ), grave or high ( when gold, jewels, silken cloth, women, men, cattle, elephants, horses and the wealth of brahmanas or temples is stolen). Vide Nār. XVII. 13-16 and Yāj. II. 275. Thieves are either prakūśa (open or patent) or aprakāśa (secret) acc. to Manu IX, 256, Br. 949 (8. B. E. 33 p. 359 V.2). Acc. to Manu IX. 258-260, Nār. ( parisista 2-3) and Br. (8. B. E. 33 p. 360 verses 3-4) patent thieves are traders who employ false weights and balances, gamblers, quacks, bribers of sabhyas, prostitutes, those who profess to arbitrate, those who manufacture imitation articles, those who subsist by progno sticating good fortune or portents or by magic or palmistry, false witnesses &c. Manu (IX. 261-266) states that in order to find out such thieves the king should employ spies in various disguises at various places such as meeting halls, refreshment rooms, brothels, wineshops, theatres &c. The concealed thieves are those who move about with tools for house-breaking without being observed and whose residence is not known; they are principally 950 of nine kinds viz. one who quietly relieves a man of his money when the latter is attending to something else, a house-breaker, a highway robber (who robs travellers ), a cut-purse, one who steals (or kidnaps ) a woman or a man, cattle, horses and other animals. Yāj. II. 266-268 and Nār. (pariśiṣta 9-12) indicate the various ways in which thieves may be detected and caught viz. by the (police ) officers recovering a part of the booty from a man or by tracing foot-steps, or by seizing one who has been ofton found to be a thief, or by finding out that the man suspected cannot state his place of residence; and they recommend that on suspicion others may be caught, if on being questioned they attempt to conceal their caste or name or if they are found addicted to gambling, wine and women or if their mouth becomes dry or their voice changes or if they spend lavishly though they have no ostensible means of earning, or those who sell lost or second-hand goods or who move about in disguise or who are found making inquiries about others' houses

Caution against punishing on suspicion

or wealth. The Mit, on Yāj. 951 II. 268 quotes Nār. and gives the warning that the king must carefully examine whether the man caught is really the thief and should not convict merely on suspicion, since even an innocent man may have stolen property near him or betray some of the signs noted above. When pro perty alleged to be stolen is found with a man, it may be that the articles came to his hands from another's hand or he may have taken it up when it lay unclaimed on the ground or he may have taken it as a thief; liars often have the appearance of honest men and vice versa (Nar. I. 71)952. Nārada's dictum (I. 42) that one who is not a thief may be held to be a thief as in the case of Mandavya has already been quoted above (p. 357n. 549 ). Vide Manu IX, 270 ( = Matsya 227.166) cited on p. 355 above. When a person is seized on suspicion of being a thief he could not be acquitted on his mere denial of the offence. He had to prove innocence by ordinary evidence (such as proof that he was elsewhere when the theft was committed) or ordeals (Yāj. II. 269). The general rule about the punishment of patent thieves was that the punishment was to be proportionate to the lightness or gravity of the crime and not to their wealth ( Vyāsa ) 953. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 361 verses 10 ff) quoted in Par. M. III. pp. 439-440 and V. P. pp. 387-88 prescribes various punishments for parti cular kinds of patent thieves e. g. sabhyas giving wrong deci sions (for bribes) or those who deceive by betraying the trust imposed in them are to be banished. Manu IX. 292 ( = Matsya 207. 184-185) holds that the goldsmith is the worst of all deceitful persons ( kantakas) and if he is found committing fraud his limbs should be cut off bit by bit. 

As regards the concealed thieves the texts lay down special rules. Nār. XVII. 21 extends to theft of the three kinds men tioned above the same punishments that are awarded in the three kinds of sahasa. Manu VIII. 323 prescribes death sentence for kidnapping men of good family and particularly women

and for theft of costly jewels; while Vyasa prescribes death by burning on red-hot iron bed for kidnapping women and mutilation of hands and feet for kidnapping a man. Yaj. Il. 273 provides impalement for those who confine others as captives, for those who steal horses and elephants and who strike others with violence, while Manu IX. 280 prescribes death for those who break royal store-houses and armoury, the inner shrine in a temple and who steal horses, chariots and elephants. For him who commits theft by housebreaking at night Manu (IX. 276 ) and Bṭ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 361, verse 17 ) provide impalement 954 after cutting off his hands. Yāj. II. 274, Manu IX. 277, Vigpu Dh. S. V. 136 prescribe for the cut-purse the punishment of the cutting of the thumb and index finger for the first offence, the cutting of the hand and foot if it is the second offence and death if he repeats the same offence a third time. Not only was the thief made to undergo punishment but he was also liable to make good the loss of property to the person robbed ( Manu VIII. 320, Yāj. II. 270, Vignu Dh. S. V. 89, Nār, parisista 21 ). According to Nār. (parisista 22-24) for thefts of articles of small value the fine was five times their price, while Manu (VIII. 326-329 ) said it was twice as much as the price. Gaut. XII. 12-14,955 Manu VIII. 337-338, Nār. (parisista 51-52 ) lay down that the fine for theft is higher in the case of the higher castes i. e. if the sūdra thief is fined eight times of the value of the article stolen, the vaisya, ksatriya and brāhmaṇa thieves were respectively fined 16, 32 and 64 times the price of the article, as each is deemed to know better owing to his higher status and culture. Manu VIII. 380 lays down the general rule that a brāhmaṇa offender was not to be killed whatever the offence might be but he was to be banished from the country allowing him to take with him all his wealth. But there were other provisions and exceptions also. Kāt.956 ( 823 ) states that

Views on punishment of thieves 

523 

the school of the Mānavas declared that thieves caught with the stolen things on them should be at once banished but that the school of Gautama disapproved of this mode, since it is condemned because it entails loss ( reduction) of people in the country. The V. R. p. 332 explains this verse as referring to a learned brāhmana. Two more verses of Kāt. (824-825 ) are quoted by V. R. P. 332 and V. C. p. 92 the first of which provides that a brāhmaṇa who is not learned whether caught with booty or not should be branded (with the appropriate signs) and deprived of all his property, provided his guilt is brought home with certainty and the second provides that a brāhmana thief who is neither learned nor rich but is strongly built should be kept under guard with fetters on his feet, should be fed on meagre food and made to do hard labour for the king till his death. Gaut. XII. 46-48, Nār. ( parisista 13-14), Manu IX. 271 and 278, Kāt. (827) hold that the punishment for those who knowingly give food, fire ( when they feel cold ), water or asylum to thieves or who receive or purchase stolen property or who conceal them are to be punished like the thieves themselves. 957 Yāj. II. 276 prescribes the highest amercement for any one who knowingly gives help to a thief or murderer in the above ways or by directions or by supplying tools or money wherewith to go to a place for committing the offence. 

In certain cases a person could take without being liable to be punished as a thief certain things belonging to another even if he had not the latter's permission. Gaut. XII. 958 25, Manu VIII. 339 ( = Matsya 227, 112-113), Yaj. II. 166 allow a person of the three higher castes to take grass, fuel-sticks, flowers of trees and plants for feeding cows and for the worship of fire from any place as if they belonged to himself and also fruits of trees that were not enclosed. In such cases he would not be liable to a fine nor does he incur sin ( Kullūka on Manu VIII. 339). A smrti passage stating that if a man takes

grass or fuel or flowers or fruits without permission deserves to have his hand cut off is explained by the Mit. (on Yāj. 166 ), Aparārka p. 774 and others as meant to apply to persons other than dvijas or as meant to refer to a case where they are taken by a person who has really no difficulty in securing these or where these are not taken for the use of cows or for worship. This matter had been a subject of discussion from ancient times. Ap. Dh. S.959 (I. 10. 28. 1--5) contains a discussion from which it appears that Kautsa, Harita, Kāṇva and Puṣkarasādi were of the opinion that whatever (however trifling or in whatever circumstances ) a man took without the consent of the owner, he became a thief; that Vārsyāyani held that there were exceptions to this rule viz. that owners should not forbid the taking (of a small quantity of ) grain in pods (such as mudga or mūṣa) or grass for bulls yoked to carts, but that if large quantities even of these were taken there would be theft. Sānti 165. 11-13, Manu XI. 16-18 and Yāj. III. 43 state that when a brāhmaṇa or other person has fasted for three days because he has had no grain with him, he may on the 4th day take grain for one day's meal from any where he can get, whether from a threshing floor or from a field or a house, and that if the owner questioned he should declare to him the reason, but a person of a lower caste should not in this way take grain belonging to one of a higher caste, unless the latter pursues a sinful course or does not perform the duties of his caste. Vyāsa quoted by Sm. C. I. p. 175 allows a man to commit even theft, when he is in distress for food, first from a person of a lower caste, then from one of the same caste and then from one of a higher caste. Manu VIII. 341 ( = Matsya 227, 110, 114), Nār. ( prakirṇaka 39 ), Saṅkha and Kāt. (822A ) state that a traveller whose food has run out may take from another's land without being liable to punishment two sugarcane stalks, two mūlakas (esculent roots ), two cucumbers or melons, five mangoes or promegranate fruit

Sahasa (crimes of violence). Manu VIII. 332, Kaut. III. 17, Nar. XVII. 1, Yaj. II. 230, Kat. (795-796) define sahasa962 as any act which is done with violence in defiance of or in spite of the presence of royal officers or guards or people. The word sahasa is a derivative from 'sahas' meaning 'force' (Nar. XVII. 1). Sometimes it is distinguished from theft (as in Manu VIII. 332, Kaut. III. 17 and Nar. XVII. 12) by saying that theft consists in depriving a person of his wealth stealthily (without force), while in gāhasa there is the use of force or violence963. Nar. XVII.2 and Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 359 verse 1) state that sāhasa 964 is of four kinds viz. manslaughter, theft, violence to the wives of others, and the two kinds of pāruṣya (treated as one head). Although these topics can be compre hended under sāhasa, they are generally dealt with separately in the smrtis and digests as a matter of convenience and in order to provide heavier punishment for crimes of violence 965, since a man guilty of a crime of violence is a worse ginner than one guilty of abuse, theft or assault (Manu VIII. 345 and 

Mit. on Yaj. II. 230) and Manu VIII. 244 enjoins upon the king not to tolerate for a moment a man guilty of violence. The

V. May, (text p. 2) says that in differentiating steya from sāhasa the maxim of cows' and 'bulls' is applicable 966. 

Sāhasa is divided by Nār. XVII. 3-6 and Br. (S. B. F. 33 p. 363 verse 24) into three varieties, viz. the lowest ( destruction, abuse and trampling of fruits, roots, water, agricultural imple ments), middling (destruction &c. of clothes, food and drink, household utensils), highest (killing with weapons or poison, violence to others' wives and whatever causes pain to sentient beings). These three kinds are respectively punished with the three kinds of punishments described above (pp. 393-94). The principal crimes included under sāhasa in its narrow sense are homicide, rape and robbery. Rape will be dealt with under strisangrahaṇa. Br. 967 states the general rule that one guilty of murder by violence should be punished with death and not with fines (S. B. E 33 p. 363 v. 29). To this the brāhmaṇa offender was an exception (Manu IX. 241 ), who was only to be banished. Manu IX. 242 introduces another exception viz. persong other than brāhmaṇas when guilty of the great sins (specified in IX. 235) through negligence should be only deprived of all their property but if they murder a man inten tionally then only are they to be sentenced to death.

the offender to death in various ways and confiscate all his property, but if a man kills another of his own caste or of a lower caste then the king may punish the offender with some punishment appropriate to the crime and the strength of the offender. In IV. 11 Kaut. provides sentences of death in various ways for murder following ancient sāstras, but remarks that if murderers have not been guilty of cruelty they should simply be sentenced to death without torture or the like 99. One special rule deserves notice. Gaut. 22. 12, Ap. Dh, S. I 9, 24 6-9, Manu XI. 87, Vas. 20. 34, Yāj. III. 251 prescribe the same prāyaścitta for murdering a brāhmaṇa woman who is an ātreyi as for one who kills a brāhmaṇa male. The different meanings of 'atreyi' given from ancient times are noted below 970, Texts

Here the word appears to mean a woman who is in her monthly illness. Vas. ( 20. 35-36) defines ātreyi as a woman who has taken the purificatory bath on the 4th day after her monthly illness begins and derives the word from अत्र 'आत्रयों वक्ष्यामो रजस्वलामृतस्नातामात्रामाहः । अत्र राज्यदपत्यं भवतीति । Vasistba either cites or summarises a Vedic passage ( as stated by Visvarūpa) which means 'here (i. e. in the womb of this woman) a child is to come'. In SBE vol. 14 p. 107 the same is translated as if the husband approaches her at that time) he will have offspring'. But this is not correct. “Eṣyat' qualifies 'apatyam' and is not in the masculine. Vas. derives the word from 37 and the root . Viṣnu Dh, S. 36.1 and 50.9 appear to hold that ātreyi means a woman of the Atrigotra. Haradatta on both Gaut. and Ap. explains ātreyi as Vasistha does and states that others interpreted it as 'अत्रिगोत्रा on या. III. 251 (aura : ) fase explains wist as a woman within 16 days from the beginning of the monthly illness and quotes af 20.36 and also says 'आत्रेयीं अधिगोवर्णयन्ति । तदपि युक्तमेव । तथा चाम्नायः ततोत्रिः सम्बभूवेत्युक्त्वा THECAECAT

like Ap. I. 9. 24. 1-5, Gaut. XXII prescribe different praye soittas for murder depending upon the castes and gexes of the murderer and the murdered. These will be briefly dealt with under prāyascitta later on. In certain cases acc. to Manu VIII. 291-292, Yāj. II. 298–299, Kaut. IV. 13, though death or injury to persons or loss of property results, no punishment was pres cribed viz, when the nose-string of bulls yoked to a cart snaps, when the yoke breaks, when the cart swerves on one side owing to the unevenness of the ground, when the axle or wheel breaks or when the leather thongs with which the several parts of the cart are tied give way, or when the rope cast round the necks of bulls or the reins break or when in spite of the driver loudly calling upon a person to move aside from the way an accident occurs. But Manu VIII. 293, 294 (=Matsya 227, 95-96) pro vide that where through the want of skill of the driver know ingly engaged by a master the cart is overturned and injury is caused, the master should be fined 200 paṇas, but if the driver employed be known to be skilful, then when injury is caused the driver should be fined (and not the employer). Further if the driver, though seeing that the road is blocked by cattle or other carts, rashly drives and kills men and animals he should be punished (Manu VII. 295). It is stated by Nār. (pārusya 32, S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 212) that the father is not liable for his son's offence, nor is the owner of a horse, dog or ape liable to punishment (for injury caused by any of these ) provided they are not set up (to do harm) by the owner. If a driver kills a man by rash or negligent driving he is to be punished like a thief; if he kills any one of the larger aninals (such as a cow, a horse, a camel or elephant) the punishment would be half of the preceding; if he kills one of the inferior animals, the fine would be two hundred. Kaut. III. 19, Manu (VIII. 285), Yaj. II. 227-229 and Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 55-59 prescribe graduated fines for the destruction of trees, plants and branches, flowers and fruits according to their usefulness and sanctity. The gmptis made a distinction as regards punishments between orimnes of violence and crimes due to negligence or mistake. For example, Manu VIII. 264 ( =Matsya 227. 30 ) prescribes a fine of 500 paṇas for depriving a man of his house, garden or Beld by threats of violence, but only prescribes a fine of two hundred if a man depripas another of his house &o. by mistake.

Punishment for abettors 

$29 

Various rules were laid down about inciters or abettors. Yaj. L. 231 and Kanṭ971. III. 17 prescribe for the man who incites another to crimes of violence double the punishment to be inflicted on the perpetrator himself and four times for one who incites another by. assuring him 'I shall give as much money as will be required'. Kāt. (798) and Br. 972 (S. B. E. 33 p.363 vers 31 ) prescribe that if several violently beat a man to death, he who gives the fatal blow on a vital part is declared to be the murderer and is to suffer the full punishment for murder. Kat. ( 832-834) 973 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 364 verse 32) provide that he who commences a crime of violence, who is a helper, who gives advice as to the way (in which sāhasa je to be carried out ), who gives refuge ( asylum) to the offender or supplies weapons, who gives food to wrongdoers, who incites ( offenders ) to put up a fight, who shows how the person ( killed ) is to be destroyed, who connives ( at the commission of an offence ), who exposes the faults of the person killed ), who gives his approval ( to the offence ), who though able does not forbid or prevent the com mission of the offence all these are (practically ) perpetrators of the crime and the king should award punishment accord ing to their ability and their guilt. Vide also Āp. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 1. 974 For those who begin an offence or abet its commission Bṭ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 364 verse 32 ) prescribes half the punishment prescribed for the wrongdoer. 975 Yāj. (II. 232 242 ) enumerates several kinds of offences as allied to sāhasa and prescribes punishments therefor, such as breaking a house that is closed under seal, causing harm to neighbours and kulikas

## 25 Strīsaṅgrahaṇa

CHAPTER XXV 

STRĪSANGRAHAŅA (Adultery or unlawful intercourse 

with a woman ). 

The Mit. ( on Yāj. 11.976 283 ) states that sangrahana means the unlawful coming together of a man and a woman for sexual enjoyment. Bp. (S. B. E. 33 p. 365 verses 1-2) says that sinful 977 sangrahaṇa is of three kinds, viz. brought about by force, deceit or sensual passion. The first (which is rape ) occurs when intercourse is had in a secluded place against the will of a woman, or with a woman who is intoxicated or is disordered in mind or is under a mistake or when she raises a cry; the second occurs when a woman is brought to one's house by some trick or pretence, an intoxicant (such as Dhatura) is administered to her or her mind is brought under control ( by chants or otherwise ) and sexual intercourse takes place; the third occurs when intercourse takes place by conveying (passion ) to each other by means of the eyes ( glances) or by employing a go-between and when the parties are drawn to each other by the temptation of beauty or of wealth. This last is again of three kinds acc. to Vyāsa and Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 365-66 verses 6-8 q. by Sm. C. II. p. 8) viz. trifling, middling and grave. The first is characterised by winking at a woman, smiling at her, sending a go-between, touch ing her ornaments or clothes; the second by the sending of flowers, unguents, fruits, incense, food, clothes, and indulging in private talks ; the third is characterised by lying on the same bed, dalliance, kissing and embraces. Stri sangrahaṇa by force (that is rape ) is really included under

sāhasa, 978 as stated by the Madanaratna, the V. P. pp. 396 397 and others. The punishments for rape were very heavy. Bp. (8. B. E. 979 33 p. 366 verse 10) states that if a man commits rape on a woman of the same caste, he was to forfeit all his property, to have bis penis and testicles cut out and was to be paraded on the back of an age, that if the woman raped was of a lower caste, then half of this punishment was to be awarded and if she was of a higher caste, he was to be sentenced to death together with confiscation of all property. Kāt. (830) prescribes that when 980 a man has forcibly had sexual intercourse with a woman capital punishment is to be inflicted inasmuch as it is a violation of (proper) conduct. When sexual intercourse was had by deceit the man was puni. shed with confiscation of all property, with branding on the forehead of the sign of the female private parts and banishment from the town (Bṛ, in S. B. E. 33 p. 366 verse 981 11). Here also the rule of Bṭ. cited above (about the reduction of sentence according to the caste of the woman concerned) applies. In the case of rape and sexual intercourse by deceit the woman was not at all punished 982 but she had to undergo a penance (prāya ścitta) of kṣcchra or parāka for contact with a male other than her husband and till she performed the prāyaścitta she was to be kept well-guarded in the house, was to remain dirty (i. e.

not to deck herself or apply or use perfumes &c.), to lie on the ground (not on a bed-stead or couch), was to receive bare main tenance. After performing prāyaścitta she was restored to her former position. Acc. to Yaj. II. 286 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 366 verse 12), for adultery (in which there is consent) the highest fine is prescribed for the male in the case of a woman of the same caste, half of this in the case of a wonian lower in caste (than the paramour), but when adultery is committed with a woman of a higher caste the male shall be put to death and the woman shall have her ears and the like cut off. Vide Shakespeare's Othello IV. 1, where Othello exclaims 'I see that nose of yours but not that dog I shall throw it to'. There were other sages who were humane and opposed to the punishment of disfigurement by way of the cutting of the ear or the nose. Yama 982a states that in the case of a woman guilty of adultery at her will, there was to be no punishment of death or disfigure ment, but only abandonment. Kāt. ( 487 ) lays down the general rule that in all offences women should be sentenced to half the fine in money which is prescribed for a male and that when the punishment is death for a male the punishment for a woman would be cutting off a limb (vide note 626 ). 

Nār. (XV. 73-75) holds 983 that sexual intercourse with the step-mother, mother's sister, mother-in-law, the paternal or maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, a friend's or pupil's wife, sister, sister's friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of one's vedic teacher, a woman of the same gotra, a woman that has sought protection, with the queen or an ascetic woman (pravrajitā) or a wet-nurse or a virtuous wife (sādlwi) or a woman of a higher caste is incestuous and the punishment to be prescribed for this crime is the excision of the penis and no less.

Bșhad-Yama III. 7, Ap. (in verse) IX. 1 (Jivananda od.) and Yama (Anandāśrama) 35 prescribe that there is no expiation except that of entering fire for incest with mother, teacher's wife, sister or daughter. It is remarka ble that Kaut. 985 and Yāj. (II. 293 ) prescribe only a fine of 24 papas for adultery with a female ascetic, while Nār. XV. 74 and Matsya 227, 141 deem it a most heinous offence. The explanation probably lies in the fact that Kaut and Yaj. refer to female ascetics of the lowest castes not following the orthodox religion, while Nār. refers to nuns of a higher order. Vide Manu VIII. 363 also. For forcible intercourse with a prostitute against 986 her will Kaut. IV. 13 and Yāj. 11. 291 prescribe a fine of 12 and 24 panas respectively. For unnatural offences or offences against the order of nature, Kauṭ. IV. 13, Yaj. II. 289, 293, Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 44, Nār. XV. 76 provide fines of 12, 24, 100, 500 paṇas 987, 

Manu IV. 134 ( = Anuśāsana 104.21 = Mārkandeya-purāṇa 34. 62-63) forbids a man to have sexual intercourse with an other's wife and states that there is nothing so detrimental to long life as that. There are stray indications in the Vedic literature about sexual intercourse outside marriage. Vide H. of Dh. II. pp. 637-639. In Rg. I..92. 4 ( adhi pesāinsi vapate nstūr iva) there appears to be a reference to a danoing girl or hetaira. Wives hating (or proving false ) to their husbands are believed to go to Hell in Rg. IV. 5. 5 (patiripo na janayo durevāḥ ). In Rg. II. 29. 1 the sage prays to the Adityas' remove away from me sin as a woman who gives birth to a child in secret removes it'( are matkarta rahasūr-ivāgah). The gambler (in Rg. X. 34, 4) states others have intercourse with his wife' (anye jāyām pari mrsantyasya). The word puiscali occurs in Vāj. S. XXX. 22. We have already seen ( H. of Dh. II. pp. 576, 1098 ) how in the Varuṇapraghasa (one of the Caturmāsyas) the wife of the sacrificer had to confess if she had a lover and how even after

she confessed to having had one she was allowed to co-operate in the sacrifice on undergoing an expiation. After a man perform ed the solemn sacrifice called Agnicayana he was enjoined (Tai. S. V. 6. 8. 3)988 not to approach a sūdra woman and after he performed Agnicayana twice he was not to approach another's wife ( H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 1255 ). 

The punishment for sangrahaṇa (rape and adultery) varied according to the caste of the man and the woman, according as the woman was married or unmarried and according as she was guarded (guptā ) or unguarded. Vide Gaut. XII. 2, Vas. XXI. 1-5, Manu VIII. 359, Viṣnu Dh. S. V. 41, Yaj. II. 286, 294, Nār. XV. 70 (as to higher or lower caste of offender), Gaut. XII. 3, Manu VIII. 374-378, 382-385, Kauṭ. IV, 13 ( about offence against guarded or unguarded woman), Manu VIII. 364-370, Yāj. II. 285, 287, Kaut. IV. 12, Nār. XV, 71-72 ( about maidens ). Further the ancient sūtras and smrtis prescribe more severe sentences than later smṛtis. Details of these matters are passed over here for want of space and as being now of academic interest only. But some examples may be noted. Gaut. XXIII. 14-15 and Manu VIII. 371 prescribe for an adulteress death by being devoured by dogs, but Yāj II. 286 softened the rigour of this. Āp. Dh. 8. ( II. 10. 26. 20-21) prescribed the penalty of cutting the penis and testicles for the male if guilty of adultery with a married woman, but only confiscation of all property if he committed adultery with an unmarried woman. But Yaj. II. 288, Manu VII. 366, Nār. XV. 72 went so far as to say that if a man had sexual intercourse with a maiden ( of the same caste) who encouraged his advances, then there is no offence punishable by the king, but he was to bestow ornaments on her, honour her and must marry her. 

It has further to be noted that Yaj. II. 290 and Nār. (XV, 79 ) 989 make it punishable to visit a dasi kept by a man in his own house or outside and Yaj. prescribes the fine of 50 paṇas for so doing. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 637-639 about prostitutes. But Manu VIII. 362 states that the rules making conversation with others' wives in lonely places punishable does not hold good in the case of the wives of actors, singers

and those who live on the earnings of their wives, since they themselves introduce their wives to others and make them mix among men ( while they themselves remain concealed ). 

Stripundharma ( duties of husband and wife). Most of the matters falling under this head have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 556-592. The liability of the husband or wife for the debts of the other has been already dealt with under ynādāna. The rights of partition, inheritance and maintenance will be discussed later on under dāyabhāga. Nār. XV. 1 defines this title of law as that in which the rules of the marriage of women and men and other related matters are described. Under this head Nār, speaks of the essential ceremonies of marriage, the rules about selecting a bride and a bridegroom, restrictions as to the caste of the bride, the guardians for marriage, faults or defects in a proposed bride or bridegroom, the forms of marriage, women called punarbhū and svairiṇi, the practice of niyoga, illicit sexual intercourse, punishment of women for adultery, re marriage, wrnasankara, mixed castes. In IX. 1 Manu promises that he will dilate upon the obligatory duties of man and wife, whether they are staying together or apart. Manu IX. 2 holds that the first duty of the husband and the males in his family is to keep women dependent and under their control if they become attached to a life of pleasure and Nār, XVI. 30 states that even women of good family come to ruin by independence. The next most important matter acc. to Manu IX. 5 and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 367 verse 2 )990 is to guard women against improper attach ments however trifling, since if they go astray they bring sorrow to both families (of the husband and of the father). Acc. to Harita,991. Saṅkha-Likhita,992 Manu (IX. 7, 9) and others the husband has to guard the wife from the approaches of other men in order to ensure the purity of the issue and by guarding her the husband guards his reputation, family, soul and his dharma,

since a woman gives birth to a son similar to the male with whom she consorts or on whom she sets lier heart during the days after the monthly illness. Here there is some anticipa tion of modern Eugenics. Manu IX 10 was quite clear that women could not be completely guarded by confining them with force in seclusion, that their minds must be occupied in family work as stated by him in IX. 11 and by Bṭ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 368993 verse 4), that the husband must try to deserve her regard and affection and show her honour (Manu IX. 22-24, 26, Yāj. I. 82). Divorce has been already dealt with in H, of Dh. vol. II. pp. 619-623. Vide Selections from Peshwa's daftar' vol. 43 p. 112 where the divorce of a woman (ghatasphota) is ordered because the husband was really a converted Mahomedan who had been illegally admitted to caste after an incorrect method of expiation.

CHAPTER xxvi 

DYŪTASAMĀHVAYA 

(Gambling and prize-fighting ) Manu IX. 223, Nār. XIX. 1 and Bṛ. (8. B. E. 33 p. 385 verse 3) define dyūta (gambling ) as that sport which is carried on with inanimate objects such as dice, pieces of leather, ivory and the like and in which there is a stake, while sport carried on with animate objects such as cocks, pigeons, rams, buffaloes and wrestlers is called samāhvaya. The attitude of Manu towards gambling was uncompromising. Manu (IX, 221-222, 224-226) calls upon the king to suppress gambling and prize-fighting in his country as they cause the destruction of the State; he states that gambling is open theft and therefore the king should endeavour to put it down and that the king should punish with corporal punishment all those who engage in gambling or who induce or help others to gamble, and that he should banish gamblers from the city because gamblers residing in the country harags wellconducted subjects by their deceitful tricks. Manu IX. 227 ( = Udyogaparva 37. 19) states that in ancient times gambling engendered great enmities and therefore a wise man should not resort to it even for amusement or in jest. Kāt. (934) is to the same effect. Yāj. II. 203 and Kaut. III. 20 994 allowed gambling in a central place under State supervision as it led to the detection of thieves. Br. 995 ( S. B. E. 33 p. 385 verse 1) refers to this divergence of viows: * Gam bling that causes loss of truth, purity and wealth was forbid den by Manu, but others allowed it because it led to the detec tion of thieves, provided it was carried on in the presence of a master of the gambling hall and provided it yielded revenue to the king'.

gambling hall which gamblers made their haunt and who sup plied the dice and other instruments of gambling was called sabhika and the stake or money agreed to be paid by the defeated gambler to the winning gambler was called pana or glaha ( Yaj. II. 199). Nār. XIX. 8 provides an optional method viz. instead 996 of gambling in a hall presided over by a sabhika, gamblers may give the king his share in the stakes, then indulge in gambling openly and if they do so they incur no punishment. Acc. to Yāj. II. 199 as interpreted by Par. M. IIL p. 574 and V. P. p. 565 the sabhika was to receive five per cent or oth part when the stake was 100 panas or more and 10 per cent or ith when the stake was less than 100 panas. Aparārka (p. 802) explains that the sabhika was to receive as his fee five per cent from the victorious gambler and ten per cent from the losing gambler. Nār. XIX. 2 prescri bes a flat rate of ten per cent on the stake as the fee of the sabhika, while Kauç.997 III. 20 lays down the fee as five per cent and allows the sabhika to charge hire for supplying gam bling accessories (such as dice, leather pieces) and for sup plying water and accommodation. The sabhika receiving protec tion from the king was to pay to the king the tax agreed upon by him, was to recover from the defeated gambler the stake (by means of confinement or restraint order ) and pay it over to the victor and was to be honest and forbearing 998 ( Yāj. II. 200, Kāt. 940, Nār. XIX. 2). Kāt. (937) states that the sabhika 999 may give to the winner the money won out of his own pocket and may recover from the losing gambler within three fort nights or at once if there is fear of losing the money, Kāt. (935) 1000 holds that if gambling was to be allowed it must be carried on openly with an arch constructed near the door in order that respectable people might not be misled ( about its real nature ) and it should yield revenue to the king. If the sabhika is

unable to make the defeated gambler pay the stake to the victor, the king would make the former pay to the latter provided the gambling was done openly in the presence of the sabhika and a group of gamblers and the king's dues were paid by the sabhika, but not otherwise ( Yāj II. 201 ). Nār. XIX. 6-7 and Yaj. II. 202 provide that when gambling is carried on secretly and without the king's permission or with false dice or other deceitful tricks, the gamblers and the sabhika would not be able to gain their object (i. e. recovering bets won or the fee ) and would be liable to punishment, viz. branding on the head ( with dog's foot and the like ) and banishment. Nār. XIX. 6 adds that the banished gamblers would have wreaths of dice tied round their necks. Kāt. (941) and Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 7) state that a person ignorant of gambling should, if defeated in gambling in private, be released from his liability, but one who is an adept in gambling should not be relieved when defeated; but oven an adept in gambling if he has lost the whole of his wealth as a stake should not be made to pay the whole. 1001 In disputes among gamblers, in deciding on victory or in the matter of gain to the winner, and as regards the question of false dice the keeper of the gaming house, if honest, is the final authority 1002 (Kat. 942). Nār. XIX. 4, Yaj. II, 202, Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 6 ), Kāt. (943) provide that when there is a dispute as to success or defeat the king should appoint gamblers to decide the dispute and gamblers will also be the witnesses in such a dispute ( in spite of the rule stated above on p. 335 that gamblers are not competent witnesses ), but if the gamblers are alleged to be inimical to the disputants the king may then 1003 himself decide the matter. Yāj. II. 203 extends all the rules about gambling to samāhvaya. Bp. (S. B. E. 33 p. 386 verse 4 ) notes that the stake is to be paid by the owner of the animal that is defeated. 1004 The $. V.

thereon that the king gets one-fourth of the stake from each of the owners of the fighting animals and that the animal that is defeated (except a wrestler or a buffalo ) is to be made over, whether living or dead, to the owner of the winner. The Mānasollāsa (vol. III. p. 229) contains an elaborate description of a king's amusenients' by way of wrestling matches, cock fights &c. The Dasakumāracarita makes frequent reference to gambling. In Ucchvāsa II. (p. 47) we are told that there are 25 kalās on which gambling depends, that legal proceedings between gamblers were decided by reliance on the sabhika and that out of a stake of 16000 dināras, the successful gambler took half and distributed the other half among the sabhika and the denizens of the gambling hall. 

Gambling is one of the most ancient vices. Rg. X. 34 is a hymn which contains the lament of a gambler. Elsewhere also in the Rg. gambling is referred to. Vide Rg. I. 41. 9 ( ex plained in Nirukta III. 16 ), VII. 86. 6 ( where it is said that dice made of Vibhidaka tree are one of the sources of sin), Rg. X. 42. 9, X. 43. 5. In the Atharvaveda algo dice and glaha occur frequently. Vide Atharva IV. 16. 5, IV, 38 (a hymn for good luck in gambling). In Vāj. S. 30. 18 we have the words 'akṣarājāya kitavam'. In certain solemn sacrifices like the Rājasūya dice play was an important item. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 1219. Pāṇini teaches the formation of many words relating to gambling. In II. 1005 1. 10 he teaches the formation of Avyayibhāva compounds like 'akṣapari' or 

salākāpari' in the sense that loss was caused by one dice being cast in a way different from the way in which it was cast in a prior game'. In IV. 4. 2 he teaches that 'akṣika' means one who uses dice in gambling or wins by using 1006 dice and in IV, 4. 19 he states that 'akṣadyūtika '1007 means '( enmity ) brought about by using dice in gambling'.

midst of the sabha (hall) having raised a table for playing dioe one should place thereon dice even in number and made from the vibhitaka wood and that players should be men of the three higher castes, pure and devoted to truth. In the Maha bharata Yudhisthira 1009 is made to say that it was his vow not to refuse dice play when he was oballenged to it. It was well known that gambling affects the minds even of the good, while in the case of those who were not ordinarily good it led to dis sensions and calamities. Many modern people Justify the action of Yudhisthira on the ground that the code of ksatriya chivalry and morality of those ancient days required that he should not be afraid to play with dice when challenged by an adversary. Conceding for the sake of argument that indulgence in gambling even on the part of such a virtuous, noble and philosophic warrior as Yudhisthira was justified or at least excusable, there is nothing to show that the code of ksatriya chivalry permitted him to gamble away his own spirited, devoted and virtuous queen and his four valiant brothers. It appears that the real aim of the great author of the Mahabharata is to emphasize that gambling is such a reprehensible pastime' and so ruinous and degrading that even the greatest and the best, when once they indulge in it, lose all sense of duty, morality and of the claims of love and affection. It has already been seen how gambling was looked upon as a great vice in the king by writers on politics and also on dharmasastra. Even the Purānas here and there condemn gambling. For example, the Brahma purāṇa (171. 29–38 ) condemns it in strong language. It says. that the gambler's wife is always in distress and the gambler on seeing the condition of his wife is also worried ( this is in almost the same words as Rg. X. 34. 10-11'), that the Veda condemns gambling and that there is no sin comparable to ganıbling.

## 27 Dāyabhāga

CHAPTER XXVII 

DAYABHAGA ( Partition of wealth ) 

The word dāya has been used even in the oldest period of the Vedic Literature. Rg. II. 32. 4 ( dadātu viram satadāyam ukthyam ) has already been quoted above (on p. 388). In Rg. X. 114, 10 ( śramasya dayam vibhajantyebhyah) the meaning of the word seems to be 'a share' or ' reward'. In the Tai. S. and the Brāhmanas the word dāya appears to be employed in the sense of paternal wealth' or simply 'wealth'. In the story of Nābhā nediṣtha 1010 it is stated that Manu divided his daya among (for) his sons' (Tai. S. III 1. 9.4). That' dāya' here stands for ' dhana' follows from another passage of the Tai. S. (II. 5.2.7) Therefore they distinguish (or establish) the eldest son by wealth'. In the Tāndya Brāhmaṇa 1011 16. 4. 3-5 also it is said Therefore whoever among ( a man's ) sons secures the best or major portion of wealth as dāya, him they regard as the son who would be the lord of all'. Another word viz. riktha occurring in the sūtra and smrti literature is also employed in the Rgveda 1912 III. 31.2 'the son of the body does not give to his sister the ancestral wealth, but makes her the receptacle for the son of her husband'. The word dayāda (meaning a con sharer, one who takes a share ) occurs frequently in the Vedic Literature. In the Tai. S. VI. 5. 8. 2 1013 it is said "Therefore women being destitute of strength take no portion (of Soma )

and speak more weakly than even a wretched (low ) man'. In the Atharvaveda V.18.6 Soma is said 1014 to be the dayāda of the brāhmaṇas. Visvāmitra invites Suna sepa to share in the spiritual wealth ( đāya) belonging to him ( Ait. Br. 33.5), calls upon his song to follow him and states that he (Sunaḥsepa ) would accept them, his wealth (daya) and his learning 1015. The Nir. III. 4 quotes or summarizes other Vedic passages in which the words dāya and dāyāda occur. In Papini IL 3.39 and VI. %. 5 the word dāyāda occurs. 

The principal heads discussed under the vyavahārapada called dāyabhāga are two, viz. partition and inheritance. For at least a thousand years there have been two schools that widely differ on these two heads; they are respectively known as the school of the Mitākṣarā and that of the Dāyabhāga on account of the pre-eminent position of these works in the respective schools. The latter school is predominant in Bengal while the former prevails in the whole of India excepting Bengal. But even in Bengal there are in modern times families governed by the law of the Mitakṣarā. This work in intention and scope does not profess to be a treatise on modern Hindu Law. It concerns itself with pointing out what the law of the Smstis and writers of medieval digests was and has to eschew an exhaustive discussion of the modern case-law and legislative enactments that have made the Hindu Law appear in many respects to be entirely different from the law of the commen taries and digests. Generally speaking, only very important divergences made by legislation and case law in the ancient and medieval Hindu Law can and may be pointed out here. 

The principal Sanskrit works of the Dayabhāga school are three viz. the Dayabhāga of Jimātavāhana, the Dāyatattva of Raghunandana and the Dāyakramasangraha of Srikrina Tarkalankāra. The Mitakṣarī school is subdivided into four sub-schools in which besides the Mitakṣarā, the supreme authority, other works are referred to as supplementary to it and as modifying some of its doctrines viz. the Benares school (which regards the Viramitrodaya as of high authority ), the

Mithilā school (which relies on the Vivādaratnakara, the Vivāda candra and the Vivādacintāmaṇi), the Mahārāṣtra or Bombay school (where the Vyavahāramayukha is of the highest authority in Gujerat, Bombay Island and Northern Konkan aven superseding the Mitākṣarā in some matters and the Vira mitrodaya and the Nirnayasindhu are also relied upon ), the Dravida or Madras school (where the Smrticandrikā, the Vyava. hāranirpaya of Varadarāja, the Parāśara-madhaviya and the Sarasvativilāsa are also works of authority ). In spite of some differences in the rules accepted in different provinces in all of which the Mitākṣarā is of high authority, all the provinces except Bengal are held to be governed by one school. Vide 

Ambabai v. Keshav I. L, R, (1941 ) Bom, 250. 

The words dāya and vibhāga have been variously defined in the digests. Nār. ( dāyabhāga, verse 1) defines the vyavahāra pada dāyabhāga as one in which sons arrange for the partition of their father's wealth. The Madanaratna as noted by the V. Mayūkba ( text p. 94) reads' arthasya pitryādeh' (wealth of the father and others ) for pitryagya' in Nārada's verse. The Smrtisangraha quoted in the Sm, C. and other works states that the word dāya applies to wealth that comes to a man through the father or the mother and the Nighantu defines daya as the paternal wealth that is to be divided. 1016 The Dāyabhāga, the Mit, and others explain that the words 'pitryasya'(father's ) and putraih'( by the sons ) in Nār. are only illustrative, the real meaning being that the word 'dāyabhāga' applies wherever the wealth of a relative (father, grand-father &c.) is distributed among his relatives (sons, grandsons &c.) simply on account of their relation to the deceased 1017 owner. This is borne out by the fact that Manu and Nārada both speak of the distribution of the mother's wealth also under dāyabhāga. The Mit. while introducing Yāj. II. 114 says that the word dāya means the wealth which becomes another's property simply by reagon of the fact of his relation to the owner. The V. Mayūkha (p. 93 ) defines daya as that wealth which is to be divided and which is not the wealth of re-united members.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Voi 

The word 'daya' though derived from the root. da' (to give ) does not apply to heritable wealth' in the literal sense (of gift).1018 The word dāya is rather conventionally used, though derived from the root 'da'. In a gift ( as stated in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 841 ) there are two chief ingredients viz.' abandoning one's ownership over a thing and bringing about the owner ship of another in that thing'. But in the case of dāya the deceased does not of his own accord abandon his ownership with the idea of creating ownership in another. The two ( dāna and dāya) are analogous in this that in both there is cessation of the ownership of a man in a thing. 

The Mit., the Par. M., the Madanaratna, the V. Mayūkha, the V. P. and other works that follow the doctrines of the Mit. divide daya into two varieties viz.apratibandha(unobstructible) 1019 and 'sapratibandha' (obstructible). The first occurs in the case of sons, grandsons and great-grandsons, who, by the very fact of their being the sons or grandsons, obtain ownership in the (ancestral) wealth held by the father or the grand father. In this case the existence of the father or grandfather presents no obstacle (pratibandha) to the son's or grandson's taking an interest by the very fact of his birth in the family property that is in the hands of the father or grandfather. Therefore this is called apratibandha dāya. But when a man takes the wealth of his paternal uncle or a father succeeds to the wealth of his son because the uncle or the son dies issueless, it is sapratibandha dāya, as in these cases the nephew or the father has no right in the uncle's or son's property as long as the uncle or the son is alive or as long as the uncle or son has a son or grandson. That is, the life of the owner or the existence of a BOR presents an obstacle to the nephew's or father's succes sion. Hence it is sapratibandha dāya. 

It is to be noted that the Dāyabhaga, the Dayatattva and a few other works do not divide dāya into two kinds. According

The meaning of daya

to them, all daya is sapratibandha i, e. ownership arises in another only on the death of the previous owner 1020 or on the cessation of the latter's ownership owing to his becoming patitu or a sannyāsin ( ascetic ). 1001 The doctrine of this school is called uparamasvatvavāda (ownership arising on death), while the school of the Mit. holds the view of janmasvatvavāda. This is the great difference between the school of the Dāyabhāga and that of the Mitākṣarā. The former does not recognise that the son, grandson or great-grandson acquires by birth any right of ownership in the ancestral property held by the father or other ancestor. 

The two words 'svu' and ' svāmin'are correlative, the idea underlying both is the same and they are two aspects of the same question. 'Sva' means 'what belongs to a person'i. e. 

property. It has direct reference to a thing and indirect reference to the owner of the thing. Svamin' means 'master or owner and directly refers to the person owning and indirectly to the thing. Vide Salmond's Jurisprudence, chap. XI. pp. 339-340 (9th ed. of 1937) for the idea of ownership. According to Siromanibhattācārya svatra is a separate padārtha (category) by itself, while others say that it is a capacity. 102

This act, therefore, did away with the effects of being patita without undergoing prayasoitta or of being excommu nicated by a caste for some grave lapse.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

Since in defining daya the idea of svatva (ownership) was brought in, many of the digests enter upon a learned disquisi tion on the question whether svatva is to be understood from the śāstra alone or is a matter of popular understanding. There is also an ulterior purpose in the minds of some writers in this discussion, viz. that of denying that svatva can arise by more birth. The reasoning of those who say that svatva is to be understood from śāstra alone is as follows: Gaut. (X. 39-42) lays 10% down five sources of ownership common to all viz. riktha ( inheritance), purchase, partition, seizure, fnding (of treasure and the like ) and further states that in the case of brāhmaṇas acceptance of gifts is an additional source of owner ship, conquest in the case of ksatriyas, gain by agriculture and service in the cases of vaisyas and sūdras respectively. If ownership were to be apprehended from means other than Śāstras, then this text of Gautama laying down sources of ownership that are common to all varnas and that are peculiar to each of the several varnas would serve no useful purpose and would be superfluous. Further Manu (VIII. 340 ) states that if a brāhmaṇa seeks wealth even by teaching or officiating as a priest for a man whom he knows to be a thief, he would be punishable like a thief. If svatva is a matter of popular under standing then this is not proper, since the priest or teacher who obtains the wealth from one who is in possession of stolen things would have to be regarded as guilty of no offence as he merely pursues the methods of earning wealth specially prescribed for him by the smrti texts. Further, if svatva is not to be appre hended from sāstra, such complaints as a thing that belongs to me has been stolen by this man' would not be possible, as svatva being a purely secular matter the thief would himself be (or would have to be deemed to be ) the owner of the thing, because the latter is in possession of it. Thieving is forbidden by śāstra and so on the view of svatva being apprehended from sāstra alone, such a complaint is understandable 1023. Besides eminent

Ownership known from $āstra alone 

549 

works and writers like the Smrtisangraha and Dhāreśvara 1024 support the view. Those who hold that svatva is known only from sāstra explain that riktha in Gautama's sūtra means simply dāya and samyibhāga means partition of dāya which establishes the separate ownership of a person on a portion of daya ( vide V. P. p. 415 ).1025 They further urge that Gautama's text does not specifically mention birth as a source of ownership, 

Others headed by the Mit. hold that svatra is apprehended from worldly usage and not from sāstra. Their reasoning is : (1) just as rice effects an ordinary worldly purpose, so svatva brings about worldly transactions such as sale. What is not owned by a man does not enable him to effect such worldly objects and transactions as sale or mortgage. Such matters as the Āhavaniya fire that are prescribed by the śāstras are not useful in effecting secular purposes, but only śāstric ones. The Ahavaniya fire may be used in cooking rice, but that is in virtue of its ordinary nature as fire and not in its sāstric nature of being the Ahavaniya fire. 1026 (2) Even among Mlecchas and lowest peoples who are quite innocent of the knowledge of sās tras, the ideas of ownership arising from transactions of sale and the like do exist. Further (3) learned men well-versed in

1025. When a man dies his wealth is the dāya which several persons may inherit. In their case, it becomes their joint property. So their ownership, being joint, is denoted by the word "riktha'. The joint owners become exclusive owners of definite parts of the daya by partition; thus partition is a source of ownership (in this case exclusive ownersbip of dis tinct parts by several), But if there is a single heir then there can be no samvibhaga (partition) and so the source of his ownership is riktha and not samvibhāga. When there are several heirs riktha is on this view a source of joint ownership only. It must be said that on the hypothesis of Jimūla vābana, riktha and samvibhāga rather coalesce with one another and cannot be distinguished so well as on the theory of the Mit.

the Mimāmsā such as Prabhākara 1027 (on Jaimini IV.1.2) and 

1027. The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 114 ) quotes a passage of Prabhākara on the lipsasutra and explains it. Jaimini's sūtra (IV. 1. 2) is utilitat: 

ET IT F USHTOTSTEHT . In tos sūtra the word lipsā occurs. Therefore this is called lipsāsūtra. The words of FPT T e a fuga m occur in the Dāyabhāga also (11. 67 p. 49) and in Medhātithi on Menu VIII 417. These words are quoted in the Mit. as taken from Prabha kara (called Guru) and so it follows that even Medhātithi quotes from Prabhākara. The earliest extant commentary of Sabara offers three expla pations of this sūtra, which deals with the question of what is kratvartha and what is puruṣārtha. The third explanation concerns itself with the rules about acquiring wealth (which is necessary for performing every sacrifice ) such as acceptance of gifts in the case of brāhmanas. The ques. tion is whether these rules about the means of acquiring wealth are krat vartha or puruṣārtha. If they are the former (i. e., if they are meant to be directly connected with the sacrifice) then a sacrifice performed with wealth not acquired according to the rules of sāstra will be defective or a nullity. But if the rules are puruṣārtba (i. e. addressed to the sacrificer only or to his conscience and sense of dharma) then even if tbe sacrifice is performed with wealth not acquired in accordance with sāstra there will be no defect in the sacrifice itself, only the acquirer will be at fault and may have to perform priyaścitta. Says Sabara : gant ar perature TUTTI Teart

The Mit. points out that in the plausible view (pūrvapakṣa) and the established conclusion ( siddhānta) it is assumed that acquisition of wealth by acceptance of gift is a matter known from worldly usage (Lokasiddha). The comment of Prabhākara (called Guru) on this sūtra is not yet available in print. The Sm. C. II. pp. 257-258, the Madanarataa, and V.P. p. 420 quote a passage from the Nayaviveka of Bhavanātha on the same subject and explain it, The Han says 'n ware Targtur i af पा अर्जनं जन्मादि। अत एवानिदंप्रथमलोकधीविषयतया स्थिते नियन्धनार्था (विषयतया tourfuafaqunut!) facular carretera.

The Mahābhāsya (vol. I. p. 483 ) on Pan. II. 3, 50 states that a thing becomes one's own in four ways viz, by purchase, by seizure, by begging or by exchange \#\# When a gorge Tourerat franar.

Ownership is understood from worldly usage 

551 

Bhavanātha, author of the Nayaviveka, hold that ownership which springs from certain fixed sources only (such as purchase) is a matter of worldly usage or experience. Bhavanātha says: the sources of acquisition such as birth and purchase &c. are known from the world. The conception about the sources of ownership was not started for the first time by the śāstra, but such sources have been knowns from times immemorial ( long before the smrtis). That is, the recognition of the sources of ownership is prior and sāstra only systematises them subsequently. There fore the smrti of Gautama (X. 39 ) only assigns their proper spheres to the several sources of ownership that are already well-known (viz. five are common to all, acceptance of gifts is peculiar to brābmanas and so on). In this respect it is like the grammar of Pāṇini. Pāpini does not create or lay down new words but he takes the words already current in the language and introduces a system about their formation. Similarly Gautama only voices a certain fixed system among the several sources of ownership. The Mit, and its followers say that Gautama simply repeats the several sources of ownership known in ordinary worldly life (as the V. Mayūkha says 'lokasiddha kāraṇānuvādakam)'. The Mit., Par. M. III. p. 481, S. V. p. 402 and others hold that riktha and samvibhāga in Gautama's sūtra stand for apratibandha dāya and sapratibandha dāya respec tively. 1028 The Mit. meets the other arguments of its opponents by replying that in the first place that even ordinary popular usage does not recognise that the thief becomes the rightful owner by simply possessing the thing stolen and that in the case where a person says 'this man has stolen my property' there is doubt and dispute whether the man charged has got ownership by purchase or the like. 

The purpose of this discussion of the topic whether owner ship is only known from sāstra or is a secular matter is, accord ing to the Mit., as follows:-Manu XI. 193 ( = Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 54, 28) states that when brāhmapas acquire wealth by reprehensi. ble actions (such as accepting a gift from an unworthy person or engaging in the sale of articles which he should not sell) 

1028. The word riktha is often used in the sense of sapratibaodba daya also as in Gaut. XII: 37 (rikthabbāja ļṇam pratikuryuh) and Yaj. II.51 (riktba grāba raam dāpyab), Baud. (riktham mrtāyaḥ kanyāyāḥ) 9. by the Mit. on Yæj. II. 146. Vide Bai Parson v. Bai Somli 36 Bom. 424 at pp. 428-434 for an exhaustive exposition of the basic principles underlying the two kinds of daya in the Mit. and the Vyavahāra-mayūkha).552

they are purified from the sin by abandoning that wealth, by repeating the sacred texts (like the Gāyatri) and by austerities. If ownership springs from sāstra alone, what is earned by & person in ways condemned by sāstra cannot become the pro perty of that man and so his sons cannot divide what is not his property. But if ownership is deemed to be a secular matter (laukika ) then even what is obtained by condemned means becomes the property of that man, his sons incur no blame (though the acquirer may have to perform penance) and can divide that wealth (which is dāya), since Manu X. 115 enume rates daya among the seven approved sources of wealth. The Madanaratna does not approve of this. Its reason briefly is that Manu XI. 193 simply lays down a penance, but does not say that wealth so obtained does not become the acquirer's pro perty, that it is on account of this that Manu does not prescribe any special fine or punishment for one who acquires wealth by means of a bad gift, as he prescribes for a thief and that what is acquired by theft does not become the property of the thief and his sons cannot divide it and would incur punishment if they do so. V. P. (pp. 423-424) refers to the views of the Mit. and the Madanaratna and approves of the views of the former, 

This discussion leads on to the next question, viz. whether ownership arises from partition or whether partition takes place of what already belongs to oneself (by birth). This subject has exercised the minds of writers on Dharmaśāstra from very ancient times. It should be noted that the difference of opinion relates only to the case of sons, grandsons and great grandsons. All writers are agreed that persons other than these have no rights by birth in the wealth of their relatives. Those who oppose the view that sons acquire right by birth argue as follows: 

If sons have ownership by birth in ancestral property, then, on the birth of a son, the father cannot enter upon such rell gious duties as consecrating Vedic fires (which entail the expenditure of ancestral wealth ) without the consent of the son, This would be opposed to the Vedic injunction "a man, whose hair is yet dark and who has had a son, should consecrate the sacred Vedio fires ". Further, Smrti passages stating that a gift made by the father to one out of several sons as a favour (Nār. dayabhāga 6 ) or by the husband to his wife out of affec tion is not liable to partition would be meaningless, since such gifts cannot be made without the consent of the sons (on the 

Theory of son's right by birth 

553 

theory that sons acquire property by birth). Besides, there are smrti texts like those of Devala 1029 which expressly negative the son's ownership during the father's lifetime. Manu IX. 104 and Nār. ( dagabhāga 2) enjoining that sons should divide wealth after the father goes to heaven (because the sons are not masters when the parents are alive, as Manu says) indicate that sons have no ownership by birth. Moreover svalva is apprehended only from sāstras (like Gautama), which do not expressly enumerate birth as a source of ownership along with purchase and the like. Therefore the ownership of the son or sons arises on the cessation of the ownership of the previous owner (by his death or by his becoming palita or becoming an ascetic). When there is a single son, he inherits on the death of the father and there is no necessity of a partition. But when there are several sons, they jointly inherit paternal wealth and can become exclusive owners of separate parts of the paternal wealth by partition alone. As this last is the most usual case, it is said that suatua arises from partition (vibhagāt svatuam ). If this doctrine that ownership arises by partition alone were literally interpreted, then an only son inheriting his father's property will have no ownership as urged by the Vyavahāra nirṇaya, since there can be no partition in his case 1030 

The arguments advanced by those who hold that owner ship in ancestral wealth arises by birth are as follows: 

It has been established that ownership is a matter of ordi nary worldly usage. It cannot be denied that it is quite well known to all ordinary people that sons acquire ownership by birth, Besides there is the text of Gautama 1031 "the acāryas hold that one acquires ownership by birth itself". Moreover there are numerous smrti passages like those of Yāj. II. 121,

XVII.2 which expressly state that in the paternal grandfather's wealth, the father and the son have equal ownership (and so the right of the son must be by birth). Those who uphold the gon's ownership by birth repel the arguments advanced in favour of the opposite theory as follows :--The Vedic text enjoining consecration of Vedio fires at a certain age indicates that the father has the power to spend for religious rites from ancestral wealth even after the birth of a son. Similarly as head of the family and its manager, the father has independent authority to spend ancestral wealth (except immovable property ) for indispensable acts of religious duty expressly enjoined by Vedic and Smrti texts and for making gifts of affection, for maintenance of the family and for ridding the family of distress. Further the father or the manager of the family can dispose of even immovable property by mortgage or sale in a season of distress or for the benefit of the family and for necessary religious purposes such as śrāddhas 1033 etc.) 

: Ownership has to be distinguished from possession and custody. Further ownership is of various kinds, such as corporeal and incorporeal, sole ownership and joint ownership, ownership as trustee and beneficial ownership, vested and contingent. Even Western writers on Jurisprudence like Austin, Pollock and Salmond, find it difficult to define the exact meaning of ownership. Austin (Lecture XLVII) defines

Definition of ownership 

555 

property or dominion as the right to use or deal with some given subject in a manner or to an extent, which though not unlimited, is indefinite. Pollock defines ownership as the entirety of the powers of use and disposal allowed by law. But the idea of ownership does not require, according to Sanskrit works on Dharmaśāstra, that the owner should always be able to do with his property as he pleases. On the contrary the śāstras lay down restrictions on the owner, enjoining upon him not to make gifts to the detriment of his family (vide Yāj. II. 175 "suum kutumbūvirodhena deyam" and the verse of the Smrti sangraha" na ca svamucyale" quoted in note 963 above ). Therefore property does not comprise only what one can dispose of at one's sweet will, but what is capable (in appropriate circumstances only ) of being disposed of as one 1034 likes. A person may be prevented from dealing with his property as he likes by the king or by the rules of sāstra, by public opinion, by his own inclinations and by the pressure of those around him. But what he owns is theoretically capable of being dis posed off by him as he liker. The Madanaratna puts forth the illustration that seeds kept dry in a granary do not sprout, yet they have the capacity of sprouting and so are as well denominated seeds as others that sprout. There are various grades of the limitations on property, such as the father's power, the widow's power and so on. What a person earns should belong to him, should be his property. But there are passages like Manu VIII. 416 and Nār. ( abhyupetyāśuśrūṣā, verse 41 ) that state 1035 "three are declared to be without wealth viz. the wife, the son and the slave; whatever they earn is for him to whom they (wife, son and slave ) belong.".

by such an ancient writer as Sabara-svāmin 1026 that this passage does not deny the ownership of the wife or son in what she or he earns, but is only intended to lay down that the wife or son cannot independently (without the consent of the husband or father ) dispose of what she or he earns. This view of the text of Manu is accepted by the Dayabhāga as well as by the Mitāk ṣarī School. The latter holds on the analogy of the interpreta tion of Manu VIII. 416 that the texts of Devala, Nār. and Manu IX. 104 which apparently deny ownership ( svāmya ) 1037 to the son during the father's lifetime over property in the hands of the father are to be interpreted only as denying the gon's power of independent dealing with such property during the father's lifetime or as referring to the self-acquisitions of the father. On the other hand the Diyabhāga and the Dāyatattva try to explain away such passages as those of Yāj. II. 121, Viṣnu and others (quoted above) that speak of the son's ownership by birth. The Dāyabhāga offers two explanations of Yaj. II. 121. 1038 The first explanation offered by it and taken from Udyota is : If A has two sons B and C of whom dies first, leaving a son D and then A dies, then Yāj. says that both B (son of A) and D (grandson of A) will be equally entitled to the wealth left by A and not B alone, though he is nearer to A than D, because both B and D offer pindas of the same efficacy to A in the pārvapa-srāddha and so there should be no difference between the two. The words "sadrśam svāmyam "refer to this equality of the son and grandson. The 2nd explanation is that of

Équal ownership of futher and son 

557 

Dhāreśvara viz. that when the father desires to make a parti. tion, he may distribute his self-acquired property as he likes among his sons, but as to the property he got from his own father (i, e. the grandfather of his sons ) he has the same ownership that sons have and he cannot make an unequal division at his sweet will. The Dayabhāga 1039 rejects the view that Yaj. II. 121 enables the son to demand partition of the grand-father's property from the father even against the will of the latter or that father and son have equal shares in the grandfather's property. The same remarks apply to the texts of Viṣnu and others viz. that in the grandfather's property father and son are equally owners and that the words " tulyam syāmyam" or "samamamgitvam" do not mean that father and son take the same share therein. 

From the above discussion it will be clear that the two schools of the Dayabhāga and of the Mitākṣarā were not started by them for the first time, but each had respectable antiquity behind it. Smrtis like those of Manu, Nārada and Devala and eminent authors like Udyota and Dhāreśyara had put forward the doctrine of uparana-svatvavūda, while the Smstis of Yaj., Viṣnu, Bp, espoused the doctrine of janmasvatuavāda. Viśvarūpa who commented on Yāj. (in the first half of the 9th century ) holds that ownership arises by birth 1040 The Mitakṣarā further supports that theory by citing a sutra of Gautama (utpatlyaiva etc.) which is not found in the extant Gautama-dharma-sūtra. This sūtra does not occur in Aparārka and several other works and is stated by Srikṛspa Tarkālankāra (on Dāyabhāga I. 21 p. 14) to be not authoritative (amūlı). These facts emboldened Dr. Jolly to go so far as to make the facile suggestion that it was fabricated by Vijñānesvara or his predecessors (Tagore Law Lectures p. 110 ). We have seen that so early a writer as Viśvarūpa was excited over the question whether ownership arises on partition or by birth. The learned Doctor has failed to note that the ancient commentator Medbātithi ( about 900 A, D.) favoured the view of ownership by birth and quotes (without name) the gūtra in a slightly different form (on Manu

It has to be noted that the Dayabhāga 1042 does admit that in some (texts ?) ownership is stated to arise by birth itself (kvucit janmanaiveti ) and it explains that the words are not to be taken literally, but that birth is said to be the source in an indirect way, as the relation of father and son is based upon birth and on the death of the father the son's ownership arises (therefore though ownership directly arises on death, birth may be said to be the source of it as the son is the first heir because of his being born as a son to the father). The Dayatattva does not say that the sutra of Gautama is not authoritative, but explains it away on lines similar to those of the Dāyabhāga. It may be stated here briefly that the Dāyablāga differs from the Mitākṣarı in four main points :-(1) The Dayabhāga denies the theory that property is by birth, while the Mit, accepts it; (2) the Dayabhāga lays down that the right to inherit and the order of heirs is determined by the principle of religious efficacy, while the Mit. school holds that blood relationship is the gover ning factor in this matter; (3) the Dayabhāga holds that members of a joint family (such as brothers or cousing) hold their shares in quasi-severalty and can dispose of them even when there is no partition by metes and bounds; (4) the Daya bhāga holds that even in an undivided family the widow succeeds

to her husband's share on his death without male issue, while the Mit. school holds that she does not do so. 

Various attempts have been made to explain why in Bengal alone the laws of succession and inheritance should diverge materially from the laws prevailing in the rest of India. In two learned papers 'on the origin and development of the Bengal school of Hindu Law'contributed to the Law Quarterly Review (vol. XXI for 1905 pp. 380-392 and vol. XXII for 1906 pp. 50-63) Mr. Justice Saradacharan Mitra tries at some length to advance a theory of his own; The commercial spirit of the newly formed nation in the eastern corner of the Indian peninsula with its deltaic character and nearness to the sea, the new ideas which other nations trading with it were bringing in every day, the necessary admixture of races in some parts of the country, the religion of Buddha which for centuries was here the religion of the sovereign as well as of the people and the influence of the Buddhistic tantras combined to bring about a law of property dissimilar in material respects from the rules propounded by Brahmanical sages of old and explained and commented upon in the Mitākṣarā and the books based on the same'. His idea is that, as Buddhism profoundly affected the position of women and as tantras like the Mahānirvāṇa sub scribed to the exaltation of the feminine element in nature, the ancient law of property, particularly in relation to women, came to be affected and conceptions of individual ownership, of freedom from restrictions on alienation and of the rights of females arose in Bengal which were incorporated by Jimūta vāhana in his Dayabhāga. With the greatest respect to the learned writer, it must be said that the grounds he urges are far from convincing. A thorough examination of his thesis cannot be undertaken here for want of space. But a few remarks must be made. As regards maritime activity the West coast of India was far more in touch with seafaring and com merce with the West than even Bengal, as the mention of the ports of Barugaza (Broach) and Kalliéné (modern Kalyan) by Greek writers, the finding of hoards of Roman coins and the existence of Syrians on the West Coast clearly establish. Bud dhism had spread to central and western India as early (if not earlier than) the period when it could have spread to Eastern Bengal and Assam. Sanchi, Bhilsa, Bharhut, the Nasik and Karla caves bear eloquent testimony to the influence of Bud dhism in central and western India for centuries before and after the Christian era. Besides as Mr. Justice Mitra himself 

560 

History of Dharmusūstra 

(Vol. 

admits 'Buddhism had not its own law of property (Law Quarterly Review vol. XXI p. 388). Buddhist countries like Burma themselves borrowed their laws of succession and inheri tance from the Manusmrti. Vijñāneśvara is far more liberal to women than Jimūtavāhana, who does not allow any woman to suoceed as heir unless she is expressly mentioned as an heir in the smrti texts. The Mahanirvana-tantra treats a sister and stepmother as near heirs and allows even a paternal uncle's widow and son's daugther to succeed; but under the Dayabhāga these are not at all heirs. One branch of the Mitakṣarā school, viz. that of the V, Mayūkha in Western India is far more liberal about the claims of women than any school. The Marumak katayam and Aliyasantan law in force in some districts of South India and among certain communities like the Nambudri brahmaṇas and Nairs go to the other extreme in their regard for women but no one has so far traced that law to Buddhist or Tantric influence. The peculiarity of the Dayabhāga, viz. the principle of religious efficacy is far more remote froin rules of affinity given in the Mahānirvāṇa-tantra than the principle of consanguinity espoused by the Mitākṣarā school. Mr. Justice Mitra is wrong in his estimate of the age of Jimūtavāhana. As stated above (on p. 557 ) Jimātavāhana relies on authors like Udyota and the smrtis of Devala and others. It is best to admit that no satisfactory explanation can be given of the peculiar dootrines of the Dayabhāga. They have an indigenous and independent origin and growth. 

Vibhāga (partition) is defined by the Mit. 1043 as the allot ment to individuals of definite portions of aggregates of wealth over which many persons have joint ownership. The Dāyabhāga found several faults with this definition, the principal criticism being that it is cumbrous and farfetched to assume that the ( joint) ownership of several (sons and the like) is first pro duced in the entire wealth of the father and then to hold that this joint ownership is subsequently destroyed. Its own defini tion is: “ Vibhāga means the indication of the ownership (of one out of many ) by the casting of a ball or pebble ( on a defi nite part of the land or cash), which (ownership) arises with

reference to a portion only (of the heritage of land and cash ), but which is indefinite because it is not possible (for one man) to deal specifically with a particular portion (of the heritage ) since there is nothing to show for certain what portion belongs to whom". The Dāyabbāga denies that owner ship jointly arises in all co-sharers ( before partition) over every portion of the heritage and states that it arises in portions of it but there is no certain indication to show which part be longs to whom and that the portion of each is made definite and ascertained by partition effected by casting a ball or pebble on a portion (saying this is A's exclusive portion' eto.). The Dāyatattva 1044 (p. 163 ) criticizes this definition. If before partition each of the co-heirs has ownership in part only of the entire heritage, what assurance is there that the allotment of a part to one co-heir by means of casting a ball will be as to the same portion over which his ownership arose before the parti. tion? The Dāyatattva, though differing 1045 from the Mit. as to the doctrine of ownership by birth, agrees with it as to the definition of vibhāga. The differing definitions of yibhāga given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga lead to different results. Under the Mit. when there is a joint family of father and sons or grand sons, all these are coparceners and the ownership of the coparconary property is in the whole body of coparceners i, e. there is unity of ownership while the family remains joint, no coparcener can say that he is owner of a definite share, one fourth or one fifth etc. A coparcener's interest is fluctuating, is capable of being enlarged by deaths and is liable to be diminished by births. It is only on partition that a coparcener becomes entitled to a definite share. On the other hand accord ing to the Dāyabhāga there is no ownership by birth, the sons on the father's death constitute a coparcenary but the owner ship of the family property is not in all the sons as a body. Every son takes a defined sbare, the moment the ownership of the father ceases ( owing to death eto.). The share so taken does not fluctuate with births and deaths. The sons are coparceners in the sense that their possession of the property

inherited from the father is joint i. e, there is unity of passession, though there is no unity of ownership. 

According to the Mitaksarā sons take by birth an interest in ancestral estate. Suppose A is sole owner of an ancestral estate and has no issue. In that case there is no coparcenary. But the moment a son is born to him, a coparcenary is started. That is, under the Mitakṣarā the birth of a son starts a coparcenary. Under the Dāyabhāga there is no coparcenary between father and sons as the latter acquire no rights by birth even in ancestral property but it may subsist between brothers or uncles and nephews. Under the Dāyabhāga, the death of a man may start a coparcenary among his sons ( who will be brothers ). 

Partition has two senses, (1) division by metes and bounds and (2) separation or severance in interest. Under the Mitakṣarā it is possible to have partition in both these senses. The members of a coparcenary may define, at a particular moment, the shares that each would be entitled to; but the actual division of property by metes and bounds may be postponed to a future date and in the intervening period they may enjoy the property in common as before. This is clearly brought out by the Vyavahāramayūkha 1046 when it says “ even in the absence of joint (family ) property severance (of interest ) takes place also by a mere declaration in the form 'I am separate from thee'; for severanoe is merely a particular mode (or state) of the mind and this declaration merely manifests that (state or mode of the mind )". The S. V. (p. 347 ) has a similar passage. It is here stated that an unequivocal declaration of intention to separate effects the severance of a member from the joint family and that it is not absolutely necessary that there should be any joint property or that the property be divided by metes and bounds. This last follows as a matter of course when there is a severance of interest. This proposition has been accept ed by the Privy Council 1047 and this passage of the Vyavahara

How separation may be effected 

563 

mayūkha has been quoted in several cases. What constitutes an unequivocal declaration of intention to separate has as usual given rise to a good deal of case law which has to be passed over here. Under the Dayabhāga heirs succeed on the death of the previous owner in certain definite shares and therefore parti tion has ordinarily only the first sense viz. assigning to the coparceners specific portions of the property inherited. Another way of separating a member 1018 is also mentioned by Manu IX. 207 and Yāj. II. 116, viz. that when a member of the family is able to fare for himself and does not desire to have a share in the family property, he should be separated by giving him some trifle ( as a token). The Mit. adds that the trifle is given as a piece of evidence to prevent his sons claiming a share later on. 

The principal matters to be discussed under Dayabhāga or Dāyavibhaga are, as stated by the Sangraha and the Mit., four, viz. the time of partition, the property liable to partition, the mode of partition and the persons entitled to partition 1049, 

Time for partition. The evolution of the son's right to demand a partition has been a process of ages. It would not be out of place to say a few words on this topic here. In most primitive societies where the patriarchal family system prevail ed, the father had absolute power over the son, it was the son's duty to obey the father, alienation of family property was not allowed, the father had power over the acquisitions of all persons including the son and women were incompetent to hold property. Faint traces of these can be detected in the Vedio literature. The legend of Sunaḥśepa narrated in the Ait. Br. ( 33. 1 ff), where we are told that Ajigarta sold his son for being offered as a victim to Varuṇa, that Viśvāmitra adopted Sunahsepa as his son, though he had already a hundred and one sons, and that he cursed and disinherited his fifty sons for their disobedience to

his order, indicates that in the days of the Ait. Br. it was believed that in hoary ages long before it, the father's power over his song was absolute. But & caution is necessary. It is possible to over-emphasize the legend of Sunahsepa ; it has to be remember ed that it is a mere legend and that the Ait. Br. itself shows that the conduct of Ajigarta was condemned as most unworthy of a decent nan even according to the legend. 1850 In modern times there are rare instances where parents insure their children and then poison them or maim them for earning the insurance money. But no one says that this is usual or that modern law allows it. In Rg. I. 117. 17 it is stated that the eyes of Rjrāśva were put out by his father because the former gave a hundred rams to a she-wolf. This is a solitary instance and it is probable that the verse has some esoteric meaning or refers to some terrestrial or celestial phenomenon. In the Kathaka Samhita XI. 4 it is said "the father rules over the son" (pita putrasyese). But it must be said that ideas about the father's absolute power over the sons lingered on in historio times. The Nir. (in III 4 ) puts forward the argument of some predecessors that daughters did not suoceed to the father's wealth because women could be donated, sold or abandoned and not men, while others said that males also were liable to the same treatment as evidenced by the story of Sunaḥsepa. 1051 Vasiṣtha (XV.%) states that 1052 father and mother have power to make a gift or sale of the son or to abandon him. We saw above ( n 1035 ) that Manu stated that a son's earnings belonged to his father. The Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 6. 13. 10-11 ) emphatically says that the right to give away or sell one's child is not recognized and that the word "sale" used in connection with a bride is used only metaphorically. About the word "sale" in relation to marriage vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 503-506. 

On the other hand even in the Rg. we find that sons divided the father's property during his lifetime when the father grew old, "O Agail men worship you in many places in various ways; they take ( from you ) wealth as from an aged father"

Drivision in father's lifetime 

565 

(Rg. I. 70.5). 1053 .In the Ait. Br. (22.9) the story of Nabhane diṣtha 1054, the youngest son of Manu, shows that the elder brothers divided all the father's property among themselves, and excluded Nabhanedistha during the father's lifetime appa rently without any protest from him or in spite of it. In the Tai. S. III. 1. 9. 4-51055 the version of the same story is different, since it is there said that Manu himself divided his wealth among his sons and did not give any share of the paternal wealth to Nabhānediṣtha who was away at a teacher's house as a vedic student. In the Gopatha Brahmana (IV. 17 ) it is said "therefore in their childhood sons subsist on their father, while in his advancing years the father subsists on the son". In the Sat. 1056 Br. (8. B. E. vol. 44, p. 157 ) we read "whence in early life the sons subsist on the father...whence in later life, the father subsists on his sons". In the Kausītaki Br. Upanisad (II. 15) after describing the symbolical handing over to the son of all his physical and mental powers by a father who is expecting death it is said that if after this rite the father recovers he has either to remain under the son's dominion or go out as a wanderer (a sannyasin). 1057 From some of the above passages, it appears that in rare cases sons divided paternal wealth even during the lifetime of the father and against his will. The remark of Dr. Jolly that " it may be unlesitatingly set down as a fact that in the earliest period of Indian Law, partition of property was an entirely unknown proceeding" ( Tagore Law Lectures p. 90) goes too far and is not fully warranted by Vedic texts. Just as the Tai. S. (III: 1. 9.4) 1058 narrates that Manu distributed his wealth among his sons, it also speaks of the eldest son being established with ancestral

wealth. The Ap. Dh, 8. (II. 6. 14. 6 and 10-12) refers to both these passages of the Tai. S. but concludes that equal division among song is the proper mode and that giving a major part of the estate to the eldest alone is forbidden by the sāstras 1059. These lead to the conclusion that equal distribution among all song was believed to be the rule and giving the major portion to the eldest son was an exception (and a rare case ) even in the Vedic age. The Ait. Bṛ. ( 19.3) speaks of the right 1060 of Indra to primogeniture ( jyaiṣthya ) and pre-eminence ( sraiṣthya). This right of the eldest son to special treatment at the time of partition persisted in the times of Manu (IX. 112 ff) and Yāj. (II. 114) also and even in modern times it is recognized to some extent in the case of impartible estates and even in ordinary families on the ground of custom or from the nature of the grants made by the former Goveroments or the British Government (such as Jaghirs and Saranjams). Both Kaut. and Kāt, declare that customs of countries, castes, villages and groups varying rules of partition and inheritance should be enforced by the king 1061, Dr Jolly (ibid. p. 98) further relies on the faot that the Apastamba dharmasūtra mentions no other kind of partition than that made by the father. But this is far from conclusive. Apas 

tamba was a great purist and idealist. He ignores several matters which are wellknown to have existed long before his time. For example, he takes no notice of the several kinds of secondary song and he does not allow a brāhmaṇa to take up a weapon even for examining it except when he is murderously attacked (I. 10. 29. 7-8), while Manu ( VIII. 345-349 ), Gautama VII. 6 and 25 and others allow a brāhmaṇa much greater latitude. Therefore Apastamba's silence cannot lead to the positive conclusion of the absence of any other method of partition. As 

· a matter of fact, Gautama (15, 19 ) who is generally regarded as prior to Apastamba states that brāhmaṇas that had separated from their fathers against the latter's will were not fit to be

Dr. Jolly also ( ibid p. 90 ) relies on an anonymous smrti text ( quoted by the Mit. in its introduction to Yāj. II. 114 ) which absolutely prohibits the sale of land. But this is irrelevant. The text could not be taken literally when we have seen that sales of land have been taking place for at least two thousand years. All that the text means is that a sale should be clothed in the form of a gift 1063. Similarly the few smrti passages that include lands and houses among indivisible properties are to be explained as having in view the fragmentation of a field into small uneconomio plots or holdings or the division of a single small house among numerous co sharers. It is impossible to bolieve that the texts meant that houses could never be partitioned among co-heirs. All that we can reasonably infer is that as a general rule such partitions were looked upon with disfavour by society. One may concede that this sentiment continued long after even Gautama and Apastamba and even in the 20th century a Hindu son suing his father for partition incurs great opprobrium. 

Apart from the inference to be drawn from some of the Vedic passages quoted above, it follows that partition did take place, though probably rarely, during the father's lifetime and even against his will, as indicated by Gautama's dictum. It is now to be seen what the smrtis and the medieval writers say about the time of partition. One time was when the father divided the property among his sons during his lifetime as evidenced by the Tai, S. III, 1. 9. 4, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14, 1, Gaut. 28.2, Baud. Dh.S. II. 2.8, Yaj. II. 114, Nār, dāyabhāga 4. Another time was after the death of the father (Gaut. 28. 1, Manu IX. 104, Yāj. II. 117, Nār. dāyabhāga 2). The Dayabhāga 1064 admits only these two times for partition viz. on the cessation of the father's

ownership (by death or renunciation of the world as an asoetic or because he has lost all desires) and during the father's life time at his own desire. The V. P. (pp. 429 and 434, 435) strongly criticizes the Dayabhaga as to these two. Some writers like Jimūtavāhana went so far as to hold that even though the father be dead there should be no partition among the sons during their mother's life 1065. The Mit. (following Gaut. 28. 1-2) indicates three principal times for partition, 1065 viz. (1) at the father's desire during his lifetime, (2) when the father has lost all desire for worldly goods, desists from sexual intercourse and the mother is past the age of child-bearing, partition may take place at the desire of the song even against the wish of the father (Gaut. 28.2,Nar. dayabhaga3,Br. S. B.E. 33 p. 369 verse 1); (3) after the death of the father. The Mit. relying on Saṅkha's 1067 text adds that even though the mother may not be past child-bearing, yet the sons can partition at

V. P.

This verse is variously read and explained by the commentators. V. R. (p. 462) notes that Prakasa read either निरपेक्षे चरमणे or निरस्ते चापि रमणे. The Dayabhāga (I. 32-33 p. 18) reads पिनटे पाप्यशरणे and explains विनष्टे पतिते अशरणे गृहस्थाश्रमरहिते. The ग्य. प्र. (p. 433) reads निवृत्ते चापि रमणात् and हलायुध also read it so (V. R. p. 462). The दायभाग (I. 47, p. 24) says दनासु भगिनी बेतिन कालार्थ कि त तासामवश्यं दानार्थम्.

their desire, even against the father's will if the father pursues an immoral or irreligious mode of life or is afflicted with a chronic disease or is very old. Nār. ( dāyabbāga 16 ) is similar. It should not be supposed that the Mit. holds that there are only three times for partition; according to it there are other times also (as in the text of Saṅkha quoted by it). This is made clear by the V. P. p. 434. The Dāyabhāga reads the text of Saṅkha-Likhita differently and takes it to mean that as long as the father is alive there can be no partition against his will even if he be very old or suffering from a chronic disease or has not all his wits about him, and tbat in such a contingency the eldest son or with his consent the next younger brother who is capable may manage the family affairs. The Daya bhāga quotes a similar passage of Hārita (which is also quoted by the Madanaratna, the Vyavahāramayūkha and other digests ). On account of the remarks of the Mit. some works like the Madanapārijāta (pp. 645 ff) speak of four times for partition, viz. during the father's lifetime at his choice (Yaj. II. 114), even against his will when the mother is past child-bear ing and the father is free from all sexual desires and does not care for wealth (Nār, dāyabhāga 3), when the father is old or follows the path of adharma or suffers from an incurable disease then even against his will (relying on Saṅkha 88 quoted in the Mit.), and after the father's death. The V. Nir. (p. 408) is almost of the game view. 

The Mitakṣarā is quite clear on the point that the son has an absolute right of partition of ancestral property during his father's lifetime even against the father's wish. The discussion in the Mitākṣarā may be briefly set out here. In Vāj. II. 120 (latter half ) it is stated that in the case of grandsons the parti tion is according to (or through ) the fathers i. e. it is per stirpes and not per capita. The text of Yāj. (anekapitīkānām 1068 tu pitȚto bhāgakalpanā ) is explained by the Mitakṣars in this way that although sons and grandsons have rights of ownership by birth in the grandfather's property, yet when each of several sons dies leaving a differing number of sons (one leaves two, another three and so on) or when some sons are alive and others die leaving their own sons, then partition takes place "per stirpes i, e. the grandsons born of a particular deceased son

get among themselves the share which their deceased father would have got If living i. e. grandsons appear to get partition of property through the son (their father) and not directly by themselves. On this a doubt arises as follows:--If the father of several song is separated from his brothers as to the grand father's property or if the father has no brother and is joint with his father (i. e. the grandfather of the grandson) the grandson cannot demand & share in the grandfather's wealth (since Yāj. II. 120 has been explained as meaning that when the father is dead then the assignment of shares among grandsons is according to the share of the father). Another doubt is: even if a partition can be had by the grandsons in these cases it will be only if the father so desires. To this the Mit. replies emphatically 1069 that in the grandfather's property the owner ship of father and son is wellknown in the world and therefore partition (in the above two cases of doubt) does take place. The Mit. further on expressly says that even when the mother is not past child-bearing and the father still cares for wealth and worldly affairs, partition of grandfather's wealth does take place at the desire of the son even if the father is unwilling. The Mit makes it clear that the rule of division per stirpes is a special rule laid down by the texts (vācaniki vyavastha) for a special case and that in other cases the primary rule of owner ship by birth applies. From Manu IX. 209 the Mitaksarā further draws the inference that even against the father's wish & son can demand partition of property acquired by the grand father. This is the modern Hindu Law in the Mitākṣarā school generally recognised by the Courts in British India. In Apaji Narhar 1070 v. Ramchandra a majority of the Full Bench of the

Son's right to partition 

591 

Bombay High Court held that a son cannot in the lifetime of his father sue his father and uncles for a partition of the family property and for possession of his share therein, when the father does not assent to such a suit, although the son has a right by birth in ancestral property. The other High Courts have dissented from this view of the majority of the Bombay Full Bench and have followed the dissenting judgment of Telang J. 1071, 

When the son's right of ownership by birth in ancestral property came to be recognised by such smṛtis as that of Yaj., it followed as a logical consequence that any person who acquires a right by birth can demand partition and separate possession of his share at any time. It has been already seen that even before Gautama sons separated from their father against his will, but this was condemned by the sages and obloquy and infamy attached to such conduct. Some of the smrtis recognised the son's right to partition even in the father's lifetime under great restrictions. More than fifteen centuries passed (from Gautama to the Mitākṣarā) before the son's right to separate from his father during the latter's lifetime and against his desire was clearly, ungrudgingly and emphatically recognized. The Viramitrodaya also clearly recognizes this right of the son. But even among writers that generally follow the Mit. there were some that could not bring themselves to admit this right of the son. For example, the Madanapārijāta (p. 662) asserts that merely at the will of the son there can be no partition. Under the Dāyabhāga, these questions cannot arise, as the son has no right by birth in ancestral property. 

This evolution of the son's right to demand partition even during the father's lifetime received a fillip from certain reli gious sentiments entertained in ancient times. Gaut. (28.4) remarks that if, instead of remaining united, brothers separate there is increase of spiritual merit (vibhāge tu dharmavrddhiḥ). Manu IX, 111 states" they (the brothers) may stay united or may stay separate if they desire an increase of dharma; by living separate dharma increases; therefore separation is meritorious ".1072

This shows that there was an option either to remain joint after the father's death or to become separate. Saṅkha-Likhita say that brothers may stay together since being united they will prosper (materially ), 1073 Bṛ. provides that in the case of members of a joint family that live together and have a common kitchen the worship of gods, Manes and brahmaṇas is single for all, while when thoy become separate such worship will be separately carried on in each house. 1074 Nār. ( dāyabhāga 37 ) lays down that when brothers are undivided the performance of religious acts is single for all of them but when there is a partition, the religious acts are separately performed by each. Dharma means here mainly such religious acts as the performance 1075 of the five great daily sacrifices (pañca mahāyajñas ). When the family is joint, worship of gods, Vaiśvadeva, honouring of family guests are only single for the whole family and all participate in the spiritual benefits derived from such aots, but when the members become separate, each performs these reli gious acts separately. Manu III. 67 lays down that each house holder has to perform with the gȚhya fire kindled at the time of marriage all grhya rites such as morning and evening offerings, the five great saorifices and the daily cooking of food. The Sangraha seems to have held that dharna refers to the perfor mance of agnihotra, but the Sm. C. II. p. 259 and V.P.( 437-438) do not accept this and hold that even when joint any coparcener can perform all srauta and smārta rites like agnihotra with the help of the undivided joint estate and so dharma means only the worship of gods and Manes and the honouring of guests.

Partition during minority 

513 

Partition was generally made when all the coparceners were major, 1077 but from Kauṭ. (III. 5), Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 42) and Kāt. (844-45) it appears that the minority of a coparcener did not operate as a bar to partition. Kaut. (III. 5) says 'partition takes place when the persons separating bave attained majority; but ( the separating coparceners) should keep in the custody of the mother's relatives of those coparceners who are minorg or of the elders of the village the share of the minors after all debts of the family are paid off, till the minor coparconers attain majority. The same rule applies to a member (of a joint family) that has gone abroad'. Baud. employs almost the same words. Kāt. provides “partition is ordained among coparceners who have attained (years of) understanding of worldly affairs and in the case of males they attain this understanding at the 16th year. The property ( share in joint family estate ) of those who have not attained years of discretion, being made free from expenses ( debts etc.), should be kept (by the other major copar ceners) with the relatives or friends of the minor members, The same should be done to the share of those who have gone abroad.” This shows that partition could take place even when some members of the family were minors and even a single member could demand at his will a partition of his share as expressly stated by the Dayabhāga (II. 16-17), the V. P, and other works 1078. There is a controversy among commentators whether minority terminated at the beginning or end of the 16th year. Nār. IV. 35 states 1079 that a person is a minor (bāla) till the 16th year. From a verse ( attributed to Angiras by Mit. on Yaj. III. 243 and quoted without name by Haradatta on Gaut. II, 6) it appears that one was to be regarded as a būla till

the beginning of the 16th year. 1090 A verse of Kat. appears to hold that minority ends at the beginning of the 16th year; many commentators also hold this view, but several such as Haradatta (on Gaut. X. 48), V. R p. 599, V. P. p. 263 expressly state that minority ends at the end of the 16th year. 1081 It may be stated that according to Gaut. X. 48-49, Manu VIII. 27, Vas. 16. 8, Vispu Dh. S. III. 65 the king was to guard the property of minors, women and helpless people. In modern times under the Indian Majority Act (Act IX of 1875 ) the age of majority is 18 (or 21 in certain cases only) except in matters of marriage, dower, divorce and adoption. In these last matters the ancient Hindu Law will apply to Hindus 1081a. Similarly a partition could be made even though the wife of a coparcener was pregnant. It was therefore that Vas. 17. 41 advised postponing partition till the delivery of the pregnant wives of coparceners, or Yaj. II. 122 and Manu IX. 216 provide for a son born after partition between father and sons. 

The next question is what property is liable to be partitioned. A few preliminary remarks on property must be made here. Property is generally divided by most smrtis into two kinds, sthāvara ( immovable, such as lands and houses ) and jangama (movable). For example, Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 323 verse 17 ) and Kāt. (516) speak of both kinds of property as subjects of pledges or mortgages. There is another classification in Yaj, II. 121 and a few other smṛtis yiz, property is of three kinds.

Sometimes however the word "dravya" is employed in the sense of all property, whether movable or immovable, as in Bp. ( dravye pitamahopātte jangame sthāvare tatha ) quoted in note 1032 above. Property, according to ancient Hindu Law,

The word "aibandha" means a periodic payment or allowance in cash or kind permanently granted by a king, a corporation or a village or a caste to a person, a family, a math or a temple, The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 318 and II. 121) explains it as a delivery or payment of so many leaves (of betel or the like) on each bundle of leaves or so many rupees on each load of merchandise or so many betelnuts on each load of betelnuts; the Sm. C. explains it as the wealth to be obtained under the order or direction of a king or other authority that dealers in commodities should pay every year or month a certain amount to a certain brāhmana or shrine; the V. Mayūkba (p. 28) explains "wbat is granted by a king or the like, to be obtained at. fixed times from mines and the like" and on p. 131 paraphrases it as *yrtti". Nibandha is rendered as corrody by Colebrooke in his Digest, but as observed by the Privy Council in Fattehsangji ». Desai Kallianraiji L. R. 1. I. A. 34 at p. 51 it is not a very happy rendering. In Ghelabhai v. Hargovan 36 Bom. 94 (at p. 101) the explanation of nibandha by the V, Mayūkha is construed as conveying that it is not tbe king alone who can make a grant of a aibandha and it is held that the office of a hereditary priest (yajamāna-vriti) is a nibandha and ranks as immovable property, Bombay Regulation V of 1827, section 1, clause 1 includes hereditary offices among immovable property. Vide Collector of Thana v. Krishna. nath 5 Bom. 322 at pp. 331-32 (for a discussion of what is included in nibandha), Collector of Thana v. Hari 6 Bom. 546 (F. B.) at pp. 555-559, Lakshmandas v.

may be divided into two classes, (1) joint family property, (2) separate property. Joint family property is either ancestral property or property jointly acquired 1083 with or without the aid of ancestral property or property acquired separately but thrown into the common stock (Manu IX, 204 ). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 120 states among unseparated brothers, if the common stook be improved or augmented by one of them through agri culture, trade or similar means, an equal distribution neverthe 1088 takes place and a double share is not allotted to the acquirer.' This contains the doctrine of merger of estate by blending. Vide Shibaprasad v. Prayag Kumari L. R. 59 I. A. 331 = 34 Bom. L. R. 1567. Ancestral property (apratibandha dāya ) is all property inherited by a male from his father, paternal grandfather or paternal great-grandfather, in which according to the Mit. School, the sons, grandsons and great-grandsons 1084 of the person who inherits it acquire an interest by birth. Sepa rate property also includes what is called self-acquired property (svārjita ), which will be discussed a little later on. If a person obtains & share of ancestral property on partition, it has been held that it is his separate property if he has no son, grandson or great-grandson, but if there be any of these then it is ancestral property in his hands so far as he and any of his male descen dants are concerned. Under the Dāyabhāga, as the son does not acquire ownership by birth in ancestral property, there is hardly any distinction between ancestral property and separate property so far as the father's powers of alienation are concerned. A few of the outstanding features of the Dayabhāga system have already been set out above and some may be discussed later.

But other writers like the author of the Viramitrodaya quoted above in note 1069 mention the great-grandson as having a right by birth and this has been accepted by the courts. The words "ancestral property" have a technical son se viz, it is paitamaha i, o, paternal grandfather's or great-grandfather's property. Vide Muhammad Husain v. Kishwa Nandan 64 1. A. 250 where this is made clear. Ia a recent case from Patna, 23 Patoa 599 (F. B.), it has been held that, where a grandfather makes a gift of his self-acquired property to his son (the father), the son or sons of the latter can treat it as ancestral property and take an interest in it by birth unless the gift makes it clear that it was made exclusively for the donee's benefit oply,. . :

Kinds of separate property 

577 

A person while he is a member of a joint Hindu family under the Mit. and has an interest in joint family property may have separate property of his own acquired in various ways. The different sources of ownership have been already mentioned above (pp. 317 and 548). The different kinds of separate property are mainly these: (1) property taken as obstructed heritage, that is, property inherited from any person other than the father, father's father or father's father's father (such as a brother, uncle etc.) 1085 ; (2) a gift of a small portion of ancestral mov able property made through affection by the father to his issue (smṛti quoted by Mit.) 1086; (3) gift or bequest of separate pro perty made by the father 1087 to his sons; (4) gifts and bequests made by other relations and friends and gifts at the time of marriage; (5) ancestral property lost to the family and recovered from a stranger by a member of a joint family with his own efforts without assistance from joint family property; (6) sepa rate earnings and gains of learning or science (vilyādhana). A. few remarks will be made on some of these in the sequel. 

It is a remarkable fact that the smrti texts on separate property do not expressly mention gifts received from strangers by a member of a joint family as the separate property of that particular member. The only gifts mentioned are those from friends, or those received at the time of marriage ( called audva hika in Yāj. II. 118 and Manu IX 206 ) or at a madhuparka in 

1085. A decision of the P, C, from Madras held that property inhe rited by two brothers living as members of a joint family from their maternal grandfather became joint property in their hands with rights of survivorship. Vide Venkayyamma v. Venkataramanayamma L. R, 29 1. A. 156. See 27 Mad 300 (F. B.) and 29 All. 667 for the difficulties caused by L. R. 29 I, A. 156. But it may be taken that even in Madras such property inherited from the maternal grandfather will now be held to be the separate property of the two brothers. Vide Muhammad Husain Khan v. Kishva Nandan Sahai L. R. 64 I. A. 250 which explains away (on pp. 264-265 ) the case of L. R. 29 I. A. 156.

But in Calcutta they are held to be ancestral (Hasari Mall v. Abaninath 17 C. W. N. 280) and in Madras it is a question of intention (Nagalingam v. Ramchandra 24 Mad. 429,-)

honour of a learned man, a priest etc. It is probable that gifts from strangers to a member of the joint family that did not fall within the several classes of separate property mentioned above belonged to the whole family. The concept of the separate property of a member of a joint family was of slow growth. Originally all property however acquired by any member might have been held to belong to the whole family. This is indicated to some extent by Manu VIII. 416, which was ( as shown above on pp. 555-556 ) however interpreted by Sabara, Medhātithi, the Dayabhāga and others in subsequent times, as meaning that the acquirer ( son or wife ) had no independent power of disposal though he or she was owner of what was earned by him or her. It is noticeable that so lato a writer as Haradatta 1088 relies on this verse of Manu and remarks that while the father is alive whatever is earned by a member, whether learned or not, belongs to the father (on Gaut. 28. 29). The Dāyabhāga 1089 (II. 66-72 ) quotes a text of Kāt. (851) "the father gets two shares or half of the wealth acquired by the son" and explains it in two ways. If the son acquires wealth with the help of ancestral funds, the father takes half of it, the acquirer gets two shares and the other sons one share each; if the son acquires wealth without using ancestral funds, the father and acquirer take two shares each and the others take nothing. Another meaning is that if the father is learned he takes half, but if he is not so, he takes only two shares. The V. P. (pp. 444-45 ) severely criticizes the Dāyabhāga for these remarks. The first inroad on the conception that the earnings of all in the family belonged to the head of the family was made in the times of the sūtras by the recognition of vidyadhana as separate property. Manu 10% IX. 208 ( - Viṣnu Dh. S. 18. 42 ) states that what one (member of a joint family, a brother etc.) may acquire by his own labour without using ( or without detriment to ) paternal estate he shall

not share with others if he does not desire to do so, because that acquisition was made by his own activity. Manu IX, 206 mentions besides vidyādhana, gifts from friends, gifts at the time of marriage and at madhuparka as the separate property of a person. Yāj. (II. 118–119) prescribes : 'whatever is acquired by a person himself without detriment to or expenditure of paternal wealth, gifts from friends, gifts at marriage, these are not liable to be divided among a man's coparceners; similarly he who recovers ancestral property lost to the family (and not recovered by the father and others) would not have to share it at & partition with his coparceners nor his gains of learning. The construction to be put on these words was a bone of contention even before Visvarūpa. The Mit. understands that the words whatever is acquired without detriment to the paternal wealth' are to be understood as qualifying each of the following four kinds of property.1091 The result is that if a gift is acquired by a member from a grateful person who was placed under obligation by spending family wealth, if property was acquired by gift from a father-in-law who was paid from the family property some wealth for securing the bride for that member ( as in an āsura marriage ) or if the property lost to the family was recovered with the help of paternal estate or if a man learnt at the expense of the family and made gains from that learning, then these kinds of properties were liable to be partitioned ainong all members. The result of taking the first half of Yāj. II. 118 as a qualification of the subsequent four kinds of property ( as done by the Mit. ) is that if a man receives a gift from a stranger even without detriment to the paternal estate the gift was liable to be divided among all members. The reason of the Mit, is that, if the first half of Yaj. II. 118 is not a qualifying clause of the four kinds of property, then the following four kinds need not be expressly mentioned at all. If whatever is acquired by a member himself without

detriment to paternal or joint estate is by itself separate property then the following four will only be particular illustrations of the proposition contained in the first half of Yaj. II. 118. It would be opposed to the usage of diatas to say that gifts from friends or gifts at the time of marriage or gains of learning acquired at the expense of the family estate become the separate property of a person and, as to vidyādhana acquired from learn ing at the expense of the family, opposed to the express text of Nar. ( dāyabhāga 10)“ when one brother maintains the family of another brother who is engaged in studying the sāstras, he shall receive a share of the wealth gained by that study, though he (the supporting brother) be ignorant himself". Further, if the first half of Yāj. II. 118 were taken as a separate and independent clause by itself then it would follow that what is acquired by pratigraha ( as a gift to a learned brāhmana) without detriment to the paternal estate would be indivisible but the usage of the siztas is the opposite of this. That there was such a usage about pratigraha is admitted by the Dāyabhāga (VI. 1, 54 p. 121). It must be stated however that this view of the Mit, about the first half of Yāj. II. 118 is not shared by several writers and works such as the Dāyabhāga VI. 1. 8. p. 106, Dipakalika, Viśvarūpa, V. R. p. 501, Apararka p. 723. 

As regards family property lost to the family by the adverse acts of a stranger but recovered by a member with his own efforts without using ancestral estate, certain provisions deserve notice. Manu IX. 209 ( = Viṣnu Dh, S. 18. 43), Br. (S, B. E. 33 p. 371 verse 12) and Kāt. 1092 (866) lay down the special rule that if the father recovers property lost to the family, whether movable or immovable, with his own effort without using joint family funds, he may retain the whole of it as his self-acquisition. The rule of Yāj. II. 119 applies only where the property lost and recovered by one member ( not the father) with his own effort and without assistance from joint estate is movable ( which then becomes wholly his self-acquisi tion), but if the property so recovered by one member ( who is

Vidyadhana (gains of learning) bas undergone the greatest changes of fortune since the earliest times to modern days. It was probably the first kind of self-acquisition recognised in very early times. Though the Ap. Dh. S. and Baud. Dh. S. say nothing about it, yet Gaut. 1094a ( 28. 28–29 ) lays down that all members of a joint family ), if not learned, should divide equally whatever is earned by them (by agriculture etc.) but what a learned man himself acquires by his learning he may not share with his unlearned brothers if he so desires. Hara datta says that this applies only between brothers that are joint. Vasiṣtha 17, 51 appears 1095 to give two shares to the acquirer of wealth at a partition among brothers and bis rule probably represents a very early stage when the acquirer could not retain the whole of his self-acquisition but got only two shares

in it and the rest of the joint family members took one share each in it. Manu IX. 206, Yāj. II. 119, Nār. ( dāyabhāga 11), Kāt. 1096 ( 868 ) and Vyāsa say generally that vidyādhana is not liable to be divided at a partition. Among writers of smṛtis Kāt. contains the most elaborate treatment of vidyādhana and of self acquisitions in general. It will be set out in the sequel. But some of the smrtis point out that even vidyādbana is partible, if learning was acquired at the expense of the family funds (as in Nār. dāyabhāga 10 referred to above) or when the learning was acquired in the family house itself from the father or an elder brother (Kat. 1097 874). The Dayabhāga (VI. 1 42-49 ) dis cusses at great length the views of Srikara on Yaj. II. 118 and Manu IX. 208 and dissents from them and states his conclusion as follows: A man since his birth depends upon his family for food and maintenance and go if the words "without expen ding ancestral estate" were literally and widely interpreted, hardly any man can say that no paternal wealth was expended on him and so earnings of whatever kind would have to be deemed to be partible and there would be no propriety or purpose in the words of Manu IX, 208. Therefore it must be under stood as done by Viśvarūpa that the detriment mhant is not the expenditure of food in maintaining a person in the house from infancy, but that when a member acquires estate by his learn ing or in any other way without giving or spending paternal wealth for acquiring that, then only it becomes his self acquisition 1098,

Definition of Vidyadhana 

583 

Kat. ( 867-873) defines 1099 and illustrates vidyadhana as follows : 

That wealth is said to be the gains of vidyā which is acquired by means of learning received from another while subsisting on food furnished by others, when a matter ( a doubt or difficult point) has been placed (before an assembly of learned men) with a wager, whatever is gained by (the display of) one's learning is known as vidyādhana, which is not divided at a partition. What is acquired from a pupil (i.e. by following the profession of teaching), by performing the work of a priest at a sacrifice, by propounding a question, by solving a doubtful point, by exhibiting one's knowledge, by disputation with a. rival, what is gained by deep learning-all these are declared to be vidyadhana, which is not divided at a partition. The same is the rule in the case of artisans and as to whatever is obtained (as a reward ) over and above the proper price of an article (which surplus becomes the self-acquisition of the member selling it). After vanquisbing a rival in a wager whatever is obtained by ( superior) knowledge should be known as vidya dhana and it is not liable to be partitioned. This is the view of Brhaspati. What is earned by an assertion of one's learn ing, what is obtained from a pupil (i.e. by teaching) and what is acquired on the analogy of priests officiating at a sacrifice all these are known as vidyadhana, according to Bhrgu. What is obtained by the superiority of one's learning and from a sacrificer and from a pupil-all this is declared to be vidyā. dhana; acquisitions other than these are common (i.e. jointly owned) with others, 

Kāt. distinguishes between suuryadhana (reward given by the king or a master when pleased with a soldier or gervant

who putting his life in danger did an act of valour) and dhvajāhrta ( what is recovered in a battle after putting one's life in danger of death and after putting to flight the army of the adversary). Nār. (dāyabhāga 6 ) and Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 381 verse 78 ) appear to put both under sauryadhana. Kāt. divides the bhāryādhana of Nār. and Br. into two, viz. lainajāgala ( what is obtained at the time of marriage with a maiden of the same caste ) and raivāhika ( wealth that comes with one's wife ). So it is the same as the vaivāhika ( of Manu IX, 206 ) and the audvāhika (of Yāj. II. 118). Vyāsa mentions 1100 a limitation that even wealth acquired by valour does not be come the exclusive property of the acquirer if he used a horse and wespons belonging to the joint family; in such a case the acquirer gets two shares and the other members of the family one share each. 

In modern times vidyadhana has been a fruitful source of litigation. The first verse of Kāt. quoted above has been cited in several cases such as Durga Dat v. Ganesh Dut 32. All 305 at p. 312, where it is said that Katyayana's definition of vidyā dbana is not exhaustive, but only illustrative (the same is the 

view of the Dāyabhāga ). 

The leading cases that discuss the texts and lay down propositions are noted below 1101 

Two propositions were well established by the cases, viz. (1) that money earned by a member of a joint Hindu family by the practice of a profession requiring special training was joint family property, provided such training was imparted at the expense of joint family property; (2) that gains made by per sonal labour and without the use or help of joint family funds by a member of a joint Hindu family, who was maintained out of joint family funds and received no more than an elementary or ordinary education suitable to his position as a member of that particular family were the self-acquisitions of such member. But all doubts and disputes are now set at rest by the Hindu

Gains of Learning Act 

585 

Gains of Learning Act (Act XXX of 1930 ) which provides that, notwithstanding any custom, rule or interpretation of Hindu Law, no gains of learning (i. e. education whether ele mentary, technical, scientific, special or general and training of every kind which enables. a person to pursue any trade, in dustry or avocation), whether made before or after the com mencement of the Act, shall be held not to be the exclusive and separate property of the acquirer merely by reason of his learning having been wholly or in part imparted to him by any member, living or deceased, of his family or with the aid of the funds of the joint family or of any member thereof or by reason of himself or his family having, while he was acquiring his learn ing, been supported wholly or in part by the joint funds of the family or the funds of any member thereof. This Act is thus retrospective. 

All property of a joint family other than the separate property of individual members is liable to partition, i. e. as stated by Kāt., property of the grandfather, of the father and whatever is acquired by each member (by the use of joint funds 1102 is so liable). Separate property is said to be impartible (avibhājya) on account of the source from which or the manner in which it is acquired. But there are certam kinds of property. which from their very nature are not allowed to be partitioned and have to be enjoyed in common or by turns. 

The oldest provision on this point is contained in Gautama1103 ( 28. 44-45 ) that water (well), (property set apart or destined for) pious uses or sacrifices and food prepared (for festivals etc.) shall not be divided nor women connected with individual

members of the family (as concubines). Saikha-Likhita 1104 forbid the partition of a building,110ka water Vessels, ornaments and clothes that are daily worn by the respective members. Similarly Usanas says 1105 " there is no partition among agnates epen up to the thousandth generation of what is acquired by officiating as priests, of a field, of vehicles, prepared food, water and women". Prajapati (quoted by Sm. C. II p. 277) asserts that there is no partition of houses, fields and temples (yājya), gifts made through favour by the father or mother. The prohi bition against dividing a house or a field is explained in three ways. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 119 explains that it has in view a brāhmaṇa's son from a wife of the kṣatriya or vaisya class, when the brahmapa acquired it as a religious gift made to him for his learning, since Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 374 verse 30 ) states "land bestowed 1106 as a gift on a brāhmana should not be given to the son of the brāhmaṇa ) from a wife of the ksatriya caste; even if the father gives it to the son of the ksatriya wife, after the father's death, the son of the wife of the brahmana class

may take it away". Another explanation is that the prohibition refers to a site or dwelling for religious purposes and to a field that is meant for grazing cowo. The third explanation is that the prohibition implies that when the house or field is of small value it should not be partitioned by metes and bounds, but there should be partitioning of the price only. The Dayabbāga gives yet another explanation ( VI. 2. 30 p. 128) that if during the father's lifetime any of the sons builds a house or lays out a garden on a family site, then it should not be divided at a partition but assigned to him only. 

ual in value and impartible, probos ordinarily 

The basic verse on things impartible from their very nature is Manu IX. 219 1107 ( =Viṣnu Dh. S. 18. 44 ) which gays "clothes, vehicles, ornaments, cooked food, water (well etc.), women, yogakṣema and ways--these are declared to be impartible". All commentators explain that clothes ordinarily worn by the several members are impartible, provided they are more or less equal in value but not costly ones nor new ones. The same remark applies to vehicles and ornaments. Pracāra means either" ways leading to the house, garden and the like" (Mit., Aparārka, and V. P.) and also 'ways and pasture lands for cows and the like' (Sm. C. II. p. 277, Kullūka). The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 118-119 ) states a special rule from Bṛ. that 1108 the clothes and ornaments worn by the father, the bed and the vehicle used by him should on his death be donated to the brāhmaṇa invited at the father's śrāddha, As to ornaments, the Mit, following Manu IX. 200 says that those ornaments that are ordinarily worn by the respective members or their wives should not be divided, but those that are not so used everyday should be divided.

be partitioned by valuing it. 109 If there be a single female slave (not a concubine ) she was to be made to work for the divided members by turns, but if there be several slaves they could be assigned to each or their price could be divided. The expression "yogakṣema" has been variously explained from very ancient times. Laugākṣi ( quoted by the Mit.) states "those who know the truth Bay that 'yoga' means 'sacrifices and kṣema means pūrta (i. e. works of charity like wells). They both (i. e. the money set apart for these or the merit derived from these ) are impartible, as are also the bed and the ( wooden) Beat (used by the father or other member )." From this verse the Mit. concludes that yogak ṣema means sacrificial acts performed with srauta or smārta fire and charitable gifts such as construct ing a tank or park etc. For ista and pārta vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 147,843-844 and pp. 914-915 n.2112 for the Mit. on yogaksema. The words“ yoga" and " kṣema" occur even in the Rgveda VII. 86. 8, X. 89, 10, X. 166.5 and in Tai Br. III. 9. 19.3 and Ait. Br. 37. 2. Even though joint family funds are spent for these still they are impartible. The Mit. further states that according to some yogakṣema means 1110 "royal ministers and purohita" who bring about the welfare of people, while others hold that the word means " umbrella, chourie, weapons, shoes, and the like". From Gaut. IX. 63 and XI. 16 it appears that yogaksema came to mean even before Gautama's time "comfortable life" or "easy and happy way of maintenance" (particularly for a learned brāhmaṇa). The V. R. p. 504 tells 1111 us that,

aooording to Prakāśa, yogakṣema means "maintenance or annuity descending from the father (to the son) at a royal palace" and that Halayudha explained yoga as meaning a ship or the like and kṣeina as fort. The Sm. O. II. p. 277 after quot ing Laugākṣi gives an alternative explanation that yogakṣema means the wealth gained by a learned brāhmaṇa resorting to a rich man for his maintenance, 1112 

Kaut. ( III. 5 ) states 1113 the view of the acāryas that those who are poor may divide even their water vessels and Kaut. adds that this dictum is fallacious or contradictory. Kat. (882-884) brings together several things that are impartible 1114 " money that is entered in a document and is set apart for a religious purpose, water, women, a nibandha ( periodic gain) that descends hereditarily, clothes worn (on the body every day), ornaments, whatever else that is not fit to be divided-these should be so employed by co-sharers that they may be enjoyed (in common by all) at the proper time. A pasture for cattle, ways, clothes worn on the body (every day), money lent and what is set apart for religious purposes--these should not be divided. This is the view of Bphaspati." 

Bphaspati ( S. B. E. 33 p. 382 verses 79-84 ) has a good deal to say about things impartible. He finds fault with Manu IX. 219 for his somewhat wide proposition that clothes, ornaments

and the Mke are impartible. He says 1115 " those who declared that clothes and the like are impartible have not given proper thought. In the case of the rich, their wealth may consist of (valuable ) clothes and ornaments. If these ( clothes and orna ments ) be kept joint ( i. e. undivided ) they cannot yield subsis tence nor can they be assigned to one alone (out of many co-sharers ). They should therefore be distributed with skill, otherwise they will become useless. Clothes and ornaments may be divided by selling them (i. e. by dividing the proceeds of sale ), debt consigned to writing is divided after recovering it (i. e. the bond itself is not divided ), cooked food ( may be divid ed) by exchanging it for uncooked food. The waters of wells that have flights of steps and of other wells is to be enjoyed by drawing it out according to the needs of the co-sharers ); in the same way a field or a water course is to be enjoyed according to respective shares ; a single female slave is to be made to work in the houses of the co-sharors according to their shares; if there be several female slaves, they are to be allotted in equal shares ( to the sharers ); this very rule applies to male slaves also; the income derived from a yogaksema grant is to be equally divid ed and pasture lands (or ways) are to be used by the co-sharers according to their respective shares. " 

The next points to be dealt with are: what persons are entiti ed to partition and what is the mode of partition. But before doing 80 some preliminary remarks must be made on the express ions coparconary and joint family', which occur at every step in modern works on Hindu Law. In the smrtis and commentaries we come across the words kutumba (Nār., dattāpradānika 6 or Yaj. II. 175), or vibhakta-kutumba (Yāj. II. 45). A joint Hindu family consists of all males lineally descended from a common male ancestor and includes their wives and unmarried daughters. A daughter on marriage ceases to be a member of her father's

Coparcenary and joint family

family and beconies a member of her husband's family. Under the Mitakṣarā a Hindu coparcenary strictly so called is a much narrower group than the joint family. It comprises only those males who take by birth an interest in the joint or coparcenary property i, e, a person himself and his sons, son's song and son's grandsons form for the time being a coparcenary. The diagram and the note below 1116 will explain the limits of a coparcenary. 

A coparcenary is purely a creation of law; it cannot be created by act of parties, except by adoption. In order to be able to claim a partition, it does not matter how remote from the common ancestor a person may be, provided he is not more than four degrees removed from the last male owner who has himself taken an interest by birth. 1117 

Some characteristic features of the Mitāksarā coparcenary may be briefly stated. There is in the first place unity of ownership i. e. the whole body of coparceners is the owner and no individual member can say, wbile the family is undivided, that he has a definite share, as his interest is always fluctuating, being liable to be onlarged by deaths and diminished by births in the family. There is also unity of possession and enjoyment i. e. all are entitled to possession and enjoyment of the family 

1116. Vide Commissioner of Income Taxv. Laxminarayan 59. Bom, 618 at p. 621. 

Here all are to be assumed to be males. A and his sons B and C may form a coparcenary. So also, if B and C have each a son, then A, B, C, D, E, will form a coparcenary. If D and E have respectively F and Gas sons, all persons from A to G will form a coparcenary. But bere the limit is reached. If X is born during the lifetime of A, he being the son of the great-grand 

son of A takes no interest by birth and is outside the coparcenary during A's lifetime. But if X is born after the death of A, then he forms a coparcenary with B, D, F. Suppose that B dies before A. That will not however introduce X iato the coparcenary of which A is the head, as X being the son of A's great-grandson F takes no interest by birth in ancestral property held by Ą. Suppose that BCDEF and G all die in the lifetime of A, then A becomes the sole surviving coparcener and X is not & coparcener along with A, because he is 3th ia descent (counting both A and X) from A, Suppose A the only surviving coparcener dies. Then X will take A's property as an heir and not by survivorship as a coparcener. 

1117. Vide Moro v. Ganesh 10 Bom. H.C. R. p. 444, pp. 461-468 where Mr. Justice Nadabhai Haridas very lucidly explains by several dia grams the limits of a coparcenary and what persons are entitled to demand a partition and from whom.592

property and the possession of one is ordinarily possession on behalf of all. Further, while the family is joint and some coparceners have many children and others have few or pone or some are absent, they cannot complain at the time of partition about some coparceners having exhausted the whole income and cannot ask for an account of past income and expenditure. Kāt. ( 883 ) expressly states so. 1118 Moreover, the joint family property devolves by survivorship i. e. on the death of a coparcener his interest lapses and goes to the other coparceners, subject to this that if the deceased has left a son, grandson, or great-grandson, the latter represents and occupies the place of the deceased coparcener when a partition takes place. A female cannot be a coparcener (even if she be the wife or the mother ). Another characteristic is that each coparcener has a right to enforce a partition. The affairs of the family are managed by the father and if he be very old or dead, by the senior brother or member or by any other member with the consent of the senior member(Nār., dāyabhāga 5 and Saṅkha quoted above in note 1067). The manager is called kartā in modern times though the smrtis and digests employ words like kutumbin (Yāj. 11. 45), grhin, grhapati, prabhu (Kāt. 543 ) and not kartā. He has special powers of disposition ( by mortgage, sale or gift) of family property in a season of distress (for debts), for the purposes and benefit of the family (maintenance, education and marriages of members and other dependents ) and particularly for religious purposes ( $rāddhas and the like ), 1119 The father has the same powers as manager and certain other special powers, which no other coparcener has. The father can separate his sons from himself and also among themselves if he so desires, even if they do not desire to separata 1120 ( Yāj. II. 114); while an ordinary

Powers of father in joint family

coparcener can only separate himself from the family. The father can make within reasonable limits gifts of ancestral movable property without 1121 the consent of his sons for performing indispensable acts of duty and for purposes laid down by the texts, such as gifts through affection (to wife, daughter, son or the like), the support of the family and relief from distress. The father can make a gift of even immovable property within 1122 reasonable limits for pious purposes only (such as to a family ido) or to an idol in a temple at the time of obsequies ). The father can sell or mortgage the joint family property to pay off an antecedent debt contracted by him for his own personal benefit, provided it is not illegal or immoral ( vide p. 448 above ). No coparcener ( except the father or manager as stated above) can dispose of his undivided interest by gift, sale or mortgage according to the strict theory of the Mitākṣarā except with the consent of the other coparceners. This right to object to alienations made without consent or made without legal necessity is another characteristio of the joint Hindu family under the Mitākṣarā. Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 384 verse 93) says 1123 "whether kinsmen are joint or separate they are alike as regards immovable property, since a single one from among them has no power in any case to make a gift, sale or mortgage of it." But in modern times the courts in Bombay, Madras and the Central Provinces have loosened this strict rule by holding that

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. 

a coparcener may sell, mortgage or alienate for value his undivided interest in coparcenary property without the consent of the other coparceners 114 and the courts have allowed the undivided interest of a coparcener in joint family property to he attached at the instance of a creditor for the individual debts of a coparcener. This is one of the most serious departures from ancient and medieval Hindu Law made by the Courts on the ground of equity. One more right of all members of the joint Hindu family is the right to be maintained from the property and income of the joint family. Such matters as the remedies of the purchaser or mortgagee from an individual coparcener are here left out of consideration as appropriate only in a treatise on modern Hindu Law. 

The conception of a coparcenary under the Dāyabhāga system is entirely different from that of the Mitaksara. Under the Dāyabhāga, bons do not acquire any interest hy birth in ancestral property, but the son's rights arise for the first time on the father's death and the sons take as heirs and not by survivorship. There is hence no coparcenary in the sense of the Mitākṣarā between a father and his sons. The father has absolute power to dispose of all kinds of ancestral property by sale, mortgage, gift, will or otherwise in the same way as he can dispose of his separate property. The son has no right to demand a partition during his father's lifetime. A coparcenary starts on the death of the father between the latter's sons or grandsons i. e. between brothers, uncles and nephews, or between cousins. If a coparcener dies without male issue, there is no right of survivorship in the other coparceners but the deceased member's widow or daughter may succeed to his share and thus even females may become members of a coparcenary under the Daya bhaga. Each coparcener takes a defined share under the Dāya bhāga ( not an indefinite one as under the Mitākṣarā ).. Any ooparconer under the Dayabhāga can sell, mortgage, or dispose off by gift or will his share ( Dāyabhāga II. 28-31 ). 1125

Rights of posthumous son 

595 Every coparcener is entitled to a share on partition. It has been already stated (on pp. 570-571 ) how in Bombay a son is not entitled to a partition if the father is joint with his own father, brothers or other coparceners and does not assent to the son's claim. There is a volume of case-law about a suit for partition brought on behalf of a minor, but it has to be passed over here, as there is hardly anything corresponding to this in the works on dharma śāstra. The texts provide for the case of a son who was in the mother's womb at the time of partition but was born after it. If A. and his sons B and C, who are members of a joint family, come to a partition and take one third each of the family property and six months later A's wife gives birth to a son D. then the partition has to be reopened and D will get 1 ( } if the mother is given a share ) of the family property that will remain after meeting all proper charges since the first partition and taking into account all income and accretions during the interval. The same rule applies to a partition among brothers, when the widow of a predeceased brother gives birth to a posthumous son conceived before the partition but born after it, Vide Yāj. 1126 II. 12% and Visou Dh. 8. 17, 3. Vasiṣtha ( 17. 40-41) therefore recommends that when it is known that the wives of some brothers (predeceased) are pregnant the other brothers should postpone partition till the delivery of those women, Where a son is born as well as conceived after partition between a father and his sonis the rights of the afterborn son are declar. ed by Gaut. 1127 28. 27, Manu IX, 216, Yāj.

acquisitions of the father made after the partition. 1129 The Mit. understands that the first half (of Yaj. II. 122 ) refers to a parti tion during the father's lifetime and provides that if a son was conceived and born to the father after partition he took the share allotted to the father and all the self-acquisitions of the father made after partition (tathā vibhāgottarakālam pitrā yat kincit arjitam tat sarvam vibhaktajasyaiva) and the Mit. relies on Manu IX. 216 and Bṛ. for this. The Mit takes the 2nd half of Yāj. II. 122 as referr ing to a partition made after the father's death and states that, if a son was in the mother's womb when the brothers separated after the father's death and was born subsequently, the posthum ous son would be entitled to reopen the partition and would get a share out of the property (not as it stood at the date of partition) that would be there after allowing for proper expendi ture (e. g. payment of debts etc.) and accretions. The Mit. extends the same rule to a posthumous son born after partition to the widow of a brother who died before the partition and 

1129. In Nawal Singh v. Bhagwan Singh 4 All. 427, where alter the father separated from his three sons he married a second wife, had a son from her and died leaving certain property inherited by bim from a third person, it was held, relying on Mapu, the Mit., Br, and the Viramitrodaya, that the son born after partition was entitled to the whole of the property acquired by the father to the exclusion of the three sons that had separated from him. In Chengama v. Munisami 20 Mad.75 (where a father partitioned his ancestral property half and half between bis two sons, reserved no share for himself and subsequently another son was born to him) it was held that the subsequently boro son was entitled to one-third by partition not only in the property as it stood at the date of partition, but also in the property acquired by the two sons by means of the produce of that property (relying on the words of Yaj. II. 122 "āyavyayavisodhitat"). The dates of the partition and of the birth of the son are not clear from the report. In Ganpat v. Gopalrao 23 Bom. 636 (where in 1875 & father separated his 800 born of his first wife by giving bim one third of the estate and gave two thirds to his two minor sons from the second wife and lived with them and another son was born to him in 1880, who sued in 1894 claiming one-fourth of all property) it was held that the one third given to the son by the first wife could not be affected and the plaintiff was only entitled to claim a share in the property given to the other two sons, and furtber that the texts of Viṣnu and Yājñavalkya are somewbat vague and are applicable only to the case of posthumous sons who have no provision made for them. Vide also Shivaji. rao v. Vasantrao 33 Bom. 267 for further limitations on this rule in favour of the after-bord 800.

Rights of posthumous son

when the fact of the pregnancy was not known to the separating brothers. Visvarūpa regards the whole verse as laying down one proposition, the first half declaring that if a son ( who had been already conceived ) were born to the father after partition with the sons, he would be entitled to the share taken by the father, while the 2nd half declares that if the father took no share then the son so born would be entitled to reopen the partit ion and take a share of the property remaining after taking into account accretions and expenses. The Dipakalikā seems to be of the same opinion as Visvarūpa, but it adds that Manu IX. 216 provides for the case where the son is both conceived and born after partition. The Sm. C. (II. pp. 306-307 ) holds that when in the father's lifetime partition takes place the sons separating should give a share to the after-born son, but the father should retain his, while the whole of Yāj. II. 122 applies to the case where partition is made after the father's death and a posthum ous son is born to the mother or to the widow of a brother dying before partition. In such a case the partition should be reopened and a share given out of the property as it stood at the first partition or out of the property as found to exist at the reopened partition after allowing for accretions and proper expenses (for payment of debts, for samskāras of brothers and sisters ); vide V. P. p. 463 for explanation of 'drøyad' etc. The Vyavahāra-mayūkha (p. 105 ) follows the Sm. C. and V. R. (p. 539 ) in explaining the whole of Yaj II. 122 as refer ring to the case of a posthumous son conceived before partition made on the father's death but born after partition from the mother or step-mother of the separating brothers or from the wife of a brother dying before partition. 

An adopted son, if adopted by a coparcener in a joint family or by a sole surviving coparcener, becomes under the Mitakṣarā law a member of the coparcenary from the moment of his adoption and has the same rights to demand a partition as an aurasa son has. Under the Dāyabhāga even an aurasa son cannot claim partition during his father's life and so an adopted son would be in no better position. If after a person adopts he has an aurasa son, the adopted son's share becomes reduced according to most commentators, but this subject will be dealt with later on under adoption. 

The emptis and some of the medieval and later digests even enter into elaborate discussions about the rights of a son or sons born from wives of classes lower than that of the father. Vide

Gaut. 28. 33-37, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 10, Kauṭ. III. 6, Vas. 17. 48-50, Manu IX. 149-155, Yaj. II. 125, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 18. 1-33, Nār. ( dāyabhāga 14 ), Bṛ. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 374 verses 27-29 ), Saṅkha ( quoted in V. R. p. 531 ). It is not necessary to deal in detail with the varying provisions made in these works, as marriages with women of a lower class have not been in vogue for several conturies; but a few remarks will have to be made. Manu IX. 153 and Yāj. II. 125, Bṛ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 374 v. 27 ) clearly state that if a brāhmaṇa has song from wives of the four classes, the whole property should be divided into ten parts which should be distributed as follows four for the son of the wife of the brābmaça caste, three for the son of the ksatriya caste wife, two for the son of the vaisya caste wife and one for the son of the sūdra class wife. Manu IX. 154 ( almost the same as Anuśāsana 47,21 ) further provides that whether a brāhmana leaves sons or no sons born (of wives of the three twice-born classes ) the heir shall give, according to the law, to the son of a sūdra class wife no more than a tenth part of his estate. V. P. p. 487 and the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 133) after quoting Manu, make this quite clear. But as remarked by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 125 the son of a brāhmaṇa from a wife of the ksatriya or other lower class was not to share in land obtained by the brāhmaṇa by way of gift (vide Br. quoted in note 1106 above ) though he could share land acquired by purchase or the like. A verse ( attributed to Bṛ, by Day. IX. 22 and V. R. p. 534 and to Devala by V. P. p. 466) denies altogether a share in land to a sūdra class wife's son of a brāhmaṇa, while Manu IX. 155 (the son of a person of the three higher classes from a sūdra woman gets no share in the paternal wealth) is Variously explained, the Mit. saying that it applies only where the son has already got some property from his father while the Mayukha and some others say that it applies to the son of a sūdra woman who is not married to the person of higher caste but is only a mistress. Kauṭ. III. 6 and Br. (quoted by V. R. P. 534) provide that the pāraśava son gets of his father's estate and the nearest sapinda gets the remaining two thirds. Saṅkha-Likhita ( quoted by Medhātithi on Manu. IX. 155 ) have the same rule as in Manu IX. 155. It is remarkable that early medieval writers like Vijñāneśvara (about 1100 A. D.) or even later ones like Mitramiāra ( first half of 17th century) in V, P. pp 464-466 enter with zest into elaborate explanations of Manu IX. 153 and Yāj. II. 125 and never expressly state that these Verses had ceased to be applicable in their days, though there

are a few other medieval works like the Sm. C. II. pp. 288-289 and the Madanaratna 1130 that either do not explain these Verses at all or say that these verses are applicable to a different age. According to Manu (IX. 178, 160) the son of a brāhmana from a sūdra class wife is called saudra or pāraśava, while according to Yaj. I. 91 he is called both niṣada and pāraśava (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 86-87 for nisada and parasava). But he is one of the secondary sons (gauna-putra) according to Manu (Ix. 180), Vas. 17.38 and others. Writers from Apararka downwards quote certain 1131 verses from Saunaka on matters forbidden in the Kali age (kali-carjya) one of which is the acceptance of sons other than auraga and dattaka. 1132

1132. In Natha v. Chotalal 55 Bom. 1 the son of a brāhmana from a sūdra wife was held entitled to a tenth sbare in the estate of his father and uncle and that the remaining nine-tentbs would go to the nearest agnate, and Manu and Yāj. are relied upon. But this would be opposed to the view of the Mayūkha that secondary sons are not allowed now and is also against the spirit of the warning given by the Privy Council to Judges of modern times over 75 years ago in Collector of Madura v. Mootoo Ramlinga 12 Moo. I. A. 397 at p. 436 " the duty of an European Judge who is under an obligation to administer Hindu Law is not so much to inquire whether a disputed doctrine is fairly deducible from the earliest authorities, as to ascer tain whether it has been received by the particular school which governs the district with which he has to deal and has there been sanctioned by usage. For under the Hindu system of law, clear proof of usage will out weigh the written text of the law. This passage (omitting the word "European") is quoted by the P. C. in Atmaram . Bajirao 62 I. A. 139 where it is further held that in a conflict between smrti texts and commen tators the opinion of the latter prevails in the provinces where their autho. rity is recognized. Natha v.

An illegitimate son has in certain circumstances rights of partition in the property of bis putative father. An illegitimate son may be a son by a concubine who is a lāsi (i. e. who is in exclusive and continuous keeping) or he may be the son of a woman who is not a clasi. The first is called dāsiputra"33 and the second is hardly ever dealt with in dharmaśāstra works. 1134

Gujerat where the Vyavahāramayukha is of paramount authority. In both cases not a word is said about the proof of the usage of marriages between a brāhmana and a sudra woman taking place in Gujerat but reliance is placed solely on the recognition of anuloma marriages by Maou and Yājñavalkya, the strong condemnation of pratiloma marriages by both and the inference drawn from the comment of Vijānesvara and the remarks of Nilakantha that anuloma marriages are not prohibited. With the most profound respect for the learned Judges who decided those two cases, it has to be said that they took up the position of legislators and did not merely interpret the Hindu Law in accordance with usage aod ignored the text of the Mayūkha itself statiog that all secondary sons (among which the son of a brāhmana from a gudra caste wife is included by Manu) except aurasa son (who is defined by Yāj. II, 128 hinself and the Mit, as the son of a wife of the same class) and dattaka are forbidden in the present age. The decision in Bai Gulab v. Jivanlal was opposed to the considered view expressed by Chandavarkar J. in Bai Kashi v. Jamnadas, 14 Bom. L. R. 547 at p. 552 ". From this gloss of the Mitāksarā from which Nilakantha expressed no where any dissent it is reasonable to infer tbat, according to the leading authorities on Hindu Law as recognised in this Presidency, a shudra wife is not permitted to a brahmin, a kshatriya or a vaishya"and to the decisions of some other High Courts in India (vide 28 All. 458 for example). It should not be supposed that the present writer is entirely against such marriages. What he is concerned to emphasize is that the Legislature should deal with these matters, that Judges should not assume the role of legislators and give rise to conflict of laws which are inevitable if the same kind of marriage is held valid by the Bombay High Court and invalid by the Allahabad or Madras High Court.

Rights of illegitimate sons 

601 

From ancient times it had been settled that the dāsiputra of a person belonging to the twice-born classes is not entitled to a share on partition or to inherit, but is entitled to maintenance only. Gāut. 28. 37 provides 1135 that even the son of a brāhmaṇa who is issueless from .a śūdra woman (a concubine ) should receive the means of maintenance provided he is obedient in the manner of a pupil. Bṛ. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 374 verse 31 ) contains a similar rule for the maintenance of an illegitimate son born of a sūdra woman after the father's death. But as regards the son of a sūdra from a dāsi Manu IX. 179 provides that such an illegitimate son may take a share in the father's property if the father allows him to do so. The classical passage on the rights of the illegitimate son of a śūdra from a dāsi is Yāj. II. 133-134 which verses are introduced by the V. Mayūkha 1136 with the words "Yāj. declares a special rule as regards one begotten by a sūdra on a woman ( of the same caste ) not married to him" and which may be rendered thus "even a son begotten by a śūdra on a dāsi may partake of a share at the choice (of his father ). But, when the father is. dead, the brothers should make him the recipient of a half share". This passage and the comments of the Mit., the V. Mayūkha, the Dāyabhāga have been cited and explained in numerous cases. The following propositions as deduced from the texts and the case-law may be set out here :-(1) the illegi timate son of a sūdra even under the Mit. does not acquire by birth any interest in the estate held by the father and so cannot enforce a partition in his father's lifetime, but the father may give him a share in his lifetime, which may even be equal to that of a legitimate gon ( 4 Bom. 37, 44-45, 23 Mad. 16 ); (2) on the father's death an illegitimate son of a deceased sūdra

1137. The decisions establish that dasi is not to be taken in the strict literal sense (a female slave), but means a woman kept as a concubine, the connection being continuous, exclusive and lawful. In order that the illegi timate son of a sūdra may take a sbare or inherit, it must be shown that the connection between the sūdra man and the woman was not incestuous or adulterons or though adulterous at the beginning had ceased to be so when the illegitimate son was born. Vide Rahi v. Govind i Bom. 97 at p. 110, Sadu v. Baixa 4 Bom. 37 (F. B.) at p. 44, Vithabai v. Pandit 28 Bom. L. R. 595, Soundararajan v. Arunachalam 39 Mad, 136 (F. B.) pp. 152-159, Tukaram v. Dinkar 33 Bom, L. R. 289. But even the son of an adulterous intercourse has been beld entitled to maintenance (1 Mad. 306, 34 Mad, 68, 47 Bom. L. R.5 F, B.). The earlier cases in Calcutta (as in i Cal. 1, 19 Cal. 91, 28 Cal. 194), held that dasi meant only a female slave and as slavery was abolished in Iodia, there could be no dzsiputra strictly so called. But in Rajaninath v. Nitai 48 Cal. 643 (F. B.) the former Calcutta decisions were overruled and the Bombay High Court's interpretation of dāsiputra has been accepted. The passage of the Daya bhāga (IX. 29 p. 143) which was to be correctly interpreted in the Calcutta Cases runs "grey gareurofiraruram: falhar a rrutia: तदाह महावास्या वा (मनु IX. 179) | अनुमतिमन्तरेण स्पर्धीशहरः सदाह याज्ञवल्क्यः । wortrae (05.

son cannot demand a partition of the joint family property though he is entitled to maintenance as a member of the family provided the father left no separate estate (L. R. 58 I. A. 402 ). It bas been held that if a sūdra keeps a woman of the brahmana caste as his exclusive mistress and has a son from her, he is not a dāsiputra (but aoc. ancient works a cāpdāla), and is not entitled to inherit the estate the sūdra father as an illegi timate son. Vide Ramchandra v. Hanumnaik 37 Bom. L. R. 920 followed in 18 Lucknow 585. Further rules about the inheri tance of the illegitimate son when in competition with the widow, legitimate daughter or legitimate daughter's son will be dealt with later on (vide n. 1356 below). 

An absent coparcener stood on the same footing as a minor ( vide note 1077 above ); in modern times he would be subject to the law of Limitation (Articles 127 and 144 of the Indian Limitation Act of 1908). 

The wife cannot herself demand a partition, but if the hus band himself separates his sons during his lifetime or if the gons claim a partition during the father's lifetime, the wife was entitled to a share equal to that of a son, according to Yāj. II. 115. If there be several wives each gets a share equal to that of a son. There is a proviso that the wife or wives must not be in possession of stridhana property given by the husband or by the father-in-law and that if there is stridhana, then only as much more will be allotted to her as will make her share equal to that of a son (as stated in Yāj. II. 148). The Mit. on Yāj. II. 52 states that at the husband's will the wife also gets a share of the faniily wealth but not by her own will 1139, The Madana ratna explains that the meaning 1140 is simply this that the

father when separating from the sons should take for each of his wives a share equal to that of each son, but it is not meant that the husband is to carve out separate portions of the joint property and hand them over to his wives, since such a proce dure would be opposed to the dictum "there is no partition between husband and wife". The V. P. (pp. 441-42) after quoting this view of the Madanaratna refutes it by saying that Yaj, is not here speaking of the partition between husband and wife but between the father and sons and that the husband assigns to the wife a share as he may give a gift of affection to his wife. It deserves to be noted that the ancient commentator Visvarūpa ( on Yaj. II. 119 of Tri. edition) anticipates modern legislation as he states that the widows of pre-deceased sons and grandsons also should be given the shares that would have been taken by their husbands if living along with his own wives by the father at the time of partition with his sons. Recently by the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (Act XVIII of 1937 as amended by Act XI of 1938), it is provided that when after the Act comes into force a Hindu governed by the Dāyabhāga School dies intestate or where a Hindu governed by any other school dies living separate property, his widow will be entitled to the same share as that of a son and the widow of a pre-deceased son or grandson shall inherit in the same manner as a son or grandson and further where a Hindu governed by any school other than the Dāyabhāga dies having an interest in joint family property his widow will succeed to a Hindu widow's estate as regards the interest he himself had. This last provision brings the law of the Mitākṣarā into line with that of the Dāyabhāga and makes the widow of a deceased coparcener a member of the coparcenary and at one stroke does away with the fundamental doctrine of the Mit. about

Rights of mother at a partition

male coparconers alone taking by survivorship joint family property, 1141 

The mother (or step-mother) also, when the sons come to a partition after the father's death, is entitled to a share equal to that of a son in the coparcenary property.1141a But she cannot compel a partition so long as the sons choose to remain joint. But her share is liable to be reduced on account of her possession of stridhana as in the case of the wife. Vide Yāj. II. 123, Viṣnu Dh. 8. 18. 34 and Nār. ( dayabhāga, 12). The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 135) combats the view of some predecessors that the mother does not take a share but oply as much wealth as would be necessary for her maintenance, by relying on the words "equal share" occurring in Yāj., Vispu, and Nār. which would be meaningless on that view. It also refutes another view that the mother takes an equal share with the sons when the ances tral property is small, while she takes only as much as would be necessary for her maintenance when the property is large, by stating that this view is liable to the fault of vidhivairūpya according to the conclusion established in the Pūrvam māmsā, that is, here the same sentence will be interpreted as laying down two different propositions in different sets of circum stances, which is not a legitimate or reasonable way of inter pretation. The Sm. C.(IL p 268 ) held the same view about the mother having no right to a share and was criticized by the Madanaratna (by name). Several works like the Vyava hārasāra (p. 225 ) and the Viyadacandra (p. 67 ) 1142 hold the

view that no woman (whether wife or mother ) should get a share of the ancestral wealth but only as much wealth as is necessary for maintenance and rely on the words of Baudha yana "there is a Vedio text that women are devoid of strength and take no share", which refers to a passage in the Tai, S. VI. 5.8.2, oocurring in the context of the ritual of the Soma sacri fice "therefore women being destitute of strength take no portion (of Soma drink) and speak more weakly than even a wretched (low ) man". Manu IX. 18 also contains an echo of this passage of the Tai. S. and of Baud, Dh. S. There was an intermediate stage in the evolution of the rights of the wife or mother. The highest she could get in the husband's wealth was two thousand papas, according to Vyasa, 1143 which is variously read and explained, the Sm. C. (II. p. 281 ) saying that it means as much wealth as would every year yield an income of 2000 papas. 

In modern times some High Courts such as those at Bombay 1144 and Calcutta allow wives and mothers to have a share when the husband or the sons divide ancestral estate by metes and bounds, while in Southern India the practice of allotting shares to them has gone out of vogue long since and the Madras High Court does not allow a share to the mother but only maintenance. The Dayabhāga seems to have 1145 held that a step-mother who was herself sonless was not entitled to a share when her step-sons came to a partition, but was only entitled to maintenance (vide Srimuli Hemangini v. Kedarnath L. R. 16 I. A. p. 115 at p. 117).

Patnibhaga division 

607 

" If a person had several wives and several sons from each wife, some of the texts prescribed from very ancient times that the song should divide according to the wives or mothers (i. e. patnibhñga, or which is practically the same thing, mātsbhāya was recommended ), though the generally recognized rule for merly as well as now is to divide according to the number of song i. e. putrabhāga ( ignoring the fact of their being born from 1146 different mothers ). For example, Gaut. 28. 15 recommends that partition should be made by grouping the sons according to their mothers and then allowing a special share to the eldest among each group of sons. Both Br. (8. B. E. 33 p. 372 verse 15) and Vyāsa 1117 lay down that if there be many sons sprung from the same father, who are equal in caste and number but who are the sons of different mothers, a division according to mothers may be legally made. Such a partition on the basis of mothers is recognized in rare cases even now on 1148 the ground of custom in certain places and among certain castes. 

A paternal grandmother or step-grandmother cannot herself demand a partition, but when a partition takes place between her son's sons, her own son being dead or when it takes place between her son and the sons of a deceased son she is entitled to a share. A text of Vyasa says 1149" the childless wives of the father are declared to be entitled to a share equal ( to that of a son) and all grandmothers are declared equal to the mother". The Allahabad and Bombay High Courts hold that the grandmother is not entitled to a share when a partition takes place between her son and his sons, while the High Courts

of Calcutta and Patna hold that she is entitled to a share even in this last cage 1150 

On account of certain bodily, mental or other defects and certain conduct also persons were excluded in ancient India from demanding a share on partition and also from taking by inheritance. Gaut. 28. 41, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 1, Vas. 17. 52-53, Viṣnu Dh. S. 15 32–39, Baud. Dh. S. II. %. 43-46, Kaut. III. 5 speak 1151 of various grounds of exclusion from partition (and inheritance) such as lunacy, idiocy, impotence, excommunica tion for grave sins or lapses of conduct, blindness, incurable disease, entering a different āśrama (viz. that of forest hermit or sannyāsa ). These grounds of exclusion probably arose from the fact of the persons labouring under them being regarded as incompetent to perform religious acts and from the close connection between property and its use for religious purposes. Jaimini 1152 (VI. 1. 41-42) lays down two propositions, viz. that one who is suffering froin an incurable or irremediable bodily defect is not entitled to undertake vedic rites, such as Agni hotra, but that one who has some defect which is remediable may engage in them and Sabara gives a blind man, a deaf man and a cripple as persons who are incompetent to engage in Vedic rites. The story of the brothers Devāpi and Santanu ( vide

J. 39, 42-44 (for the opposite proposition that tho grandmother would be entitled to a sbare io a partition between her only son and the latter's son). In view of tbe fact that Vyasa declares the grand. mother to be equal to the mother it appears that all grand-mothers, whether sonless or not, should secure a shara.

Grounds of exclusion from partition

H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 109 ) as narrated in the Bșhad-devata 1153 states that the elder brother Devāpi suffered from & skin disease and so refused the kingdom which went to his younger brother Santanu. We know from the Mahabharata that Dhrta rāṣtra who was blind from birth, though elder, had to give up the kingdom in favour of his younger brother Pāṇdu 1154. The Mit. (on Yāj. II, 135 ) energetically combats the view put for ward by some predecessors that all wealth is meant for sacrifices. They relied on two smrti passages 1155 "all dravya (all kinds of wealth or movable property) has been created for the sake of sacrifice; therefore all those who are not competent to perform sacrifices are not entitled to share ancestral wealth but are only entitled to food and raiment. Wealth has been created for sacrifices; therefore one should employ it (or spend it) on pur pores of dharma and not on women, fools and irreligious people". Kāt. (852) and Bṛ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 371 verse 10 ) contain similar remarks. The Mit. does not accept this proposition, which argues that on that hypothesis no gifts ( apart from sacrifices) that are recommended by the śāstras will be possible, nor can one accom plish two of the puruṣārthas 1156 viz, artha and kāma (as required by Gaut. IX. 46, Yāj. I. 115) and that the verses quoted above only moan that whatever wealth is collected for sacrifices should be spent only for that purpose even by the sons of the man who collected it, since a smsti text condemns generally everyone who does not spend wealth collected for a sacrifice for that purpose to becoming a crow or a bhāsu (a cock or water fowl) in the next life. The Mit. further argues that the view would be opposed to the conclusion of Jaimini 1II. 4. 20-24" that the Vedic injunction "one should wear gold on one's person" is merely puruṣārtha and not 'kratrartha'.

In नारद, the मिता., दायभाग, अपरार्क, दायतव and ध्य, प्र. read औपपातिका (which means 'one guilty of उपपातक'). Vide मनु.XI. 59-66 and विष्णुधर्मसत्र chap. 37 for long lists of उपपातकs such as गोषध, पारदार्य, अपाण्ययाजन &c. The स्मृतिच.

The मदनररन gave this very explanation for अपयात्रित. The वि. र. reads अपपात्रित (p. 489) and gives the same explanation of it as the कल्पतर. The ग्य. मयूख p. 163 says it is better to explain अपयात्रित (derived from यात्रा meaning ' sea voyage') differently, disapproves of the explanation of अपयावित given by the मदनरत्न on the ground that for one guilty of sedition or high treason the breaking of a jar or of excommunication is not prescribed and that our means 

one who goes to another continent or country by sea in a vessel for trade and the like'. Constantly engaging in sea voyage was one of the matters forbidden in the Kali age; vide 'द्विजस्थारधी तुनौयातु:शोधितस्याप्यसंग्रहः ' quoted by नीलकण्ठ, which verse is quoted as from आदित्यपुराण by हेमादि vol. III. 2 p.667. नीलकण्ठ is wrong about high treason. गौतम (20. 1-4) declares that one should desert even one's father who is guilty of regicide and describes a ceremony in which an unclean vessel is brought by a slave or servant from a dost heap and is filled with water from a jar carried by a female slave and than the vessel is struck with the foot and emptied with the words' 'I make

Persons excluded from share

entitled to no share". Yaj. II. 140 declares that the impotent, the outcast and his son, a lame man, a mad man, an idiot, a blind man and one afflicted with an incurable disease are not entitled to a share. It will be noticed that Yāj. expressly excludes the son of an outcast, as do also Baud. and Devala. Nār. (dāyabhāga 21-22) says 'one hostile to his father, an outcast (patita ), an impotent person, one who goes to another continent by sea (from India Lome these even though they be aurasa sons shall not get a share; how can a kṣetraja ( a son of the wife raised by another person by appointment) get a share ( if he has these defects) and persons afflicted with long standing. (like phthisis) and severe diseases (like leprosy ), persons who are either idiots, insane or lame-these must be maintained by the family, but their sons are entitled to a share'. These verses of Manu, Yaj. and Nār have been quoted and explained in numerous decisions of the courts in India, but all such cases are mostly of academic inte rest now since the passing of the Hindu Inheritance (Disabi lities Removal) Act of 1928 and hence need not be dwelt upon here. The Act ( XII of 1928 ) applies to the whole of British India except to persons governed by the Dāyabhāga school and provides that no person governed by the Hindu Law, other than a person who is and has been from birth a lunatic or idiot, shall be excluded from inheritance or from any right or share in joint family property by reason only of any disease, deformity or physical or mental defect. This Act is not retrospective and does not confer on any person any right in respect of any religious office or service or any right to the management of any religious or charitab!: trust which he would not have had before the Act. Therefore under the Act the only defects that would disqualify a person governed by the Mitākṣarā school from claim. ing partition or inheritance are congenital lunacy and congenital idiocy. Under the Dāyabhāga school the grounds of exclusion will still remain as before except as modified by judicial deci sions and by other Acts. An important question under the Mit. school arises in this way. What is the exact position of a son that is congénitally idiotic or insane. Both Manu (IX. 201 and 203) and Yāj. ( II, 140, 141) declare that they are anarsa or nirantaka ( not entitled to a share of the ancestral estate ), but must be given maintenance and if maintenance be not given by those who are liable to give it, they would incur sin ( as Manu IX. 202 expressly says) and that the song of disqualified parsons take a share, if they are themselves free from defects. If A has a son B who is congenitally idiotio, is B still a copar:612

coner of A (though not entitled to a share or to claim partition) so that A cannot make a gift of the whole or a portion of the property or a bequest thereof to his widow? This question arose in Amirthammal v. Vallimayil I. L. R. (1942) Mad. 807 ( F. B.), where it was decided that, when A made a will in the above circumstances bequeathing all family property absolutely to his widow and two sons were born to the disqualified man B after A's death, the father had no power to make a will as the disqualified member B was still a coparcener (though not entitled to a share) and that he transmitted the heritage to his sons. The chief ground of the decision was a passage of the Sarasvativilāsa (explained on pp. 817 and 828-830) which is quoted below 1159, 

The grounds of disqualification apply to males and females alike, as stated by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 140 1160. A few remarks will be made on pulita and his son. The commission of every sinful act. did not make one patita as the word was technically understood. There were various grades among sins, which will be described in the section on pūtakas. The grave sins were differently enumerated by different ancient writers. In explaining 1161

P. 364. The S. V. does not appear to be laying down any novel proposition. All that this passage appears to mean is that though these disqualified persons cannot themselves enjoy a share, yet they do have a share (in theory) and if they can marry or are eligible for marriage their sons that are free from defects do take a share and that one cannot lay down a sweeping proposition that all congenitally dumb or insane persons or idiots can marry, but that there are degrees in these defects and in certain extreme circum. stances these disqualified persons cannot marry.

Grave sins 

Rg. X. 5.6 " the wise made seven boundaries (restrictions) by transgressing even any one of which a man becomes sinful", the Nirukta VI. 27 enumerates the seven sins as "theft, violat ing the bed (of the guru.), murder of a brāhmaṇa, murder of a bhrūña, continual performance of sinful acts, telling a lie as to a sinful matter". In the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. I., Sat. Br. XIII. 3.1. 1. and other Brahmana texts, the murder of a brāhmaṇa seems to have been regarded as the gravest of all sins ( vide H. of Dh. vol.

V. 10. 9 the five great sinners are declared to be the thief of gold, the drinker of liquor, the violator of the guru's bed, the murderer of a brāhmaṇa and one who associates with them. Gaut. (XXI. 1-3) declares that the murderer of a brāhmaṇa, the drinker of liquor, one guilty of sexual intercourse with the wife of his guru (elder or teacher ) or with women who are the eapiṇdas of his father or mother, a thief (who steals a brāhmaṇa's gold), an atheist, one who continually does forbidden acts, one who does not abandon a palita (son or the like through affection) and one who deserts his relations though they are not patita are palitas and so is one who incites another to commit & grave sin and also one who associates with a patita for a year (as regards a vehicle, a seat and bed). Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 7. 21. 8-11) contains a longer list of grave sins (pataniya ). Vas. (I. 19-21) states that there are five grave sins ( mahāpātukas) viz. violating the bed of the guru, drinking liquor, murder of a learned brāhmaṇa, robbing a brāhmaṇa of gold and contact with a patita by being his teacher or pupil or priest or by contracting a matrimonial alliance with him. The Baud. Dh. S. II. 1.50-56 has a somewhat different list of pataniya actions viz. sea voyage, robbing a brāhmaṇa of his wealth and misappropriating a deposit, per jury for land, trading in (forbidden ) articles, service under a sūdra and having a child from a södra woman, Manu XI. 54, Yāj. III. 227 and Visṇu Dh. S. 35. 1 enumerate the five well

known mahāpatakas, viz. murder of a brābmapa, drinking of liquor, theft, incest and continuous association for a year with these. Association with any sinner of any sort for one year made the associater guilty of the same sin (Yāj. III. 261). 

Samsarga or saryoga ( contact or association) was of various kinde. Manu XI. 180 ( = Sānti 165.37 = Baud. Dh. S. II, 1. 88= Vas. 1.22 ) states that a person who associates with a patita for a year as regards using the same vehicle or seat or taking food with him in the same row becomes patita ; but he becomes patita at once by being his sacrificial priest or by being his teacher of the Veda or by entering into 1163 a matrimonial alliance with him. Vrddha-Bphaspati 1164 ( quoted by Mitākṣarā on Yaj. III. 261 ) states that association ( sankara ) with a patita is of nine kinds viz. occupying the same seat or bed, taking dinner in the same row with him, cooking food in his cooking pots, partaking of cooked food prepared by him, being a sacri ficial priest or employing him as a priest, being his teacher of the Veda or making him one's teacher of the Veda, giving him one's daughter in marriage or taking his daughter in marriage, taking food with him in the same pot. Devala 1165 declares that sin is passed on from one man to another by conversation (with a sinner ), by touching him, by his breath (coming in close contact with one's nose ), by occupying the same vehicle (horse) or seat, by eating (in his company ), by being a priest for him or by making him one's priest, by being his teacher of Veda or making him one's teacher or by matrimonial alliance. The same causes that led to a male being patita operated in the cage of a woman to make her patita; there was one additional cause viz a woman became patita by sexual connection with a male of a lower class than herself (Gaut, 21. 9, Yaj. III. 297 and Saunaka 1166). The ancient sages were very considerate even

to fallen women. They provide that even women that are patita and have not yet performed the proper penance were not to be cast on the streets, but they were to be given a hut ( near the house ) for residence and bare maintenance that would keep body and soul together and were to be guarded against further lapses ( Yaj. III. 296). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II pp. 571-573. 

How far unchastity will debar a female from inheritance will be discussed a little later on, Adultery in general was an upapātaka only according to Manu XI. 59 and the ordinary penance for it was cāndrāyana or govrata (Manu XI. 117 ). But if the adultery was with a person of low caste, the woman became palita and would not have been entitled to a share on partition ( as a wife or mother) under the old Hindu Law. 

In the case of those guilty of grave sins who did not perform the prayaścittas prescribed for such sins there was a peculiar procedure called ghatasphota prescribed for excommuni cating them and severing all connection with them and treating them as dead, which has been described in H. of Dh. vol. II p. 388. Vide Gaut. 20. 2-7, Manu XI. 182-184, Yāj. III. 294. But when the sinner performed the appropriate prāyaścitta (penance), the smrtis declare that he became fit to be associated with (vyavahārya), he was to be welcomed by his relatives who were to take a bath along with him in a holy river or the like and who were to throw in the water an unused jar filled with water, he should offer grass to cows in the midst of his relations, they were not to find fault with him later on, Vide Manu XI. 186-187, Yāj. III. 295, 299, Vas. 15. 20, Gaut. 20-10-14 ( which prescribes the recital of certain Vedic mantras and the offering of clarified butter into fire). Āp. Dh, S. 1. 9. 24. 24-25 and I. 10. 29. 1-2 prescribe for the sinner who kills a guru or & śrotriya that has performed soma sacrifice or a bhruna certain observances till death, but declare that such a person can never get rid of the logs of the right of association with all people, that there is no return for him to his relatives. 1167 In the Nirnaya sindhu (III Uttarardha pp. 567-68) and in the Dharmasindhu (III Uttarardha pp. 453–54 ) the rite of ghatasphoṭa for a patita and the rite for taking him back are concisely described. 1168 - The smrtis state that when a man knowingly committed a sin, penances did not necessarily remove the otherworldly con

sequences of the sin altogether but the ginner became fit to be associated with (Yaj. III. 226). In the case of the patita, even his son born after he committed a grave sin was held to be patita by inost writers of smrtis ( Yāj. II, 140, Vigpu Dh. S. 15. 35-36, Kaut III. 5 ) 1169. But in the case of the daughter a difference was mercifully made. Vas. ( 13. 51-53 )1170 states "the sages say that one born of a patita becomes a patita, except a female child, since she is to go to another (person as his wife ); one may marry her without accepting any wealth (of her patita father) along with her". Yāj. III. 261 also says that the daughter of a patita may be married after making her fast and after making her leave everything ( belonging to the patita father ) in her father's house. Visvarūpa ( on Yāj. III. 257 ) quotes a prose passage from Hārita to the following effect : the daughter of a patita should have fasted one day and night, should take a bath without clothes, should put on white and new garments in the morning, should loudly repeat thrice 'I do not belong to him (my patita father) nor is he anyone to me' and then she inay be married at a sacred place (river etc.) or in one's (the bridegroom's ) house. 

These rules about a patita led to this result that if a Hindu changed his religion or was excommunicated or was made an outcast for some lapse that his caste looked upon with great disfavour, he was deemed to have lost his rights of partition or inheritance. The Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850) abrogates these rules of the ancient 1171 Hindu Law.

Vide p. 101 where the P. C. say that the Legislature virtually set aside the provisions of the Hindu Law.

Rights of disqualified persons 

617 

All the smrtis say that those who are deprived of their rights to partition on socount of the several defeats mentioned ama antitled to maintenance out of the family property 28. long as they are alive (Gauten 28. 41, Vas 17. 54, Viṣnu Dh. S. 15. 33, Manu. IX. 202, Yaj. II. 140 etc.). If the disqualified persons want to marry or are married, then their sonless wives that are chaste should be maintained (Yaj. II. 142), but those that are unchaste should be driven out and so also those wives that are hostile to the family ; but the Mit. adds that even hostile wives of disqualified heirs must be maintained provided they are chaste. If the disqualified person has an aurasa son or kṣetraja son 1171, who is free from the defects mentioned above (such as impotence) he becomes entitled to & share of the joint family property and the daughters of dis qualified persons are entitled to be maintained in the family and provision must be made for their marriages (Manu IX. 203, Yāj. IL 141). It follows that disqualified heirs could not adopt, since Yaj. II. 141 mentions only aurasa and kṣetraja sons. Many of the smrtis did not allow even maintenance to the patita and his son ( vide Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 46, Kauṭ. III. 5, Devala, Viṣnu Dh, S. 15. 35-36 ). Coparoeners were prevented from claiming a share at a partition if at the time of the partition they were labouring under the defects mentioned above. But if after partition 1172 the defect which disqualified a member be

removed by medical treatment or the like then the disqualified member was entitled to reopen the partition on the analogy of a posthumous son born after partition. So also if a person is quite free from defect when he takes at a partition a share in joint family property or inherits, subsequently supervening defect does not divest the property once vested in him. 

Some of the emptis contain rules that appear to be only recommendatory. Ap. Dh.1173 S. II. 6. 14. 15 says that if even the eldest son or brother were to waste joint wealth in immoral or improper ways he should be given no share ( by the father or brothers at a partition). To the same effect are Gaut. 28, 38 and Manu IX. 214. 

Gaut. 28. 43 and Viṣpu Dh. S. 15. 37 provide 1174 that the song of pratiloma unions (i, e. of a man with a woman of a higher class ) are to be dealt with like the sons of a brāhmaṇa from a śūdra woman i. e. they would be entitled to maintenance from their father, though pratiloma unions were condemned. Kat. (862-864) provides that the son of a woman married out of her order, one who is born of a sagotra union and one who is an apostate from the order of ascetics do not obtain ancestral wealth; but the son of a woman married in the wrong order takos the ancestral wealth if he is of the same class as his father, and the son of a woman who is not of the same caste as the husband (but of a lower caste ) and is married in the proper order takes the wealth of the father. But the son of a woman

The word WAATETUS is interpreted in two ways: (1) If a brāhmana married a kpatriya girl first and then married a brāhmaṇa girl, both womon became M ATOT (as the procedure was against Manu III, 12). The son of the kṣa triya woman in such a case did not take the wealth of his father but only the son of the other woman took it. The other ioterpretation (given by the UETTATT) is based upon the dootrine of ofte , for which vide H, of Dh. vol. II. PP. 346-549 and Manu. III, 172.

Marriage expenses of brothers and sisters

united with a man in the reverse order of castes does not take the ancestral estate ; but the approved view is that he should be given food and raiment till his death by the kinemen. In case there are no kinsmen such a son takes the whole wealth of his father and if the father left no wealth kingmen are not bound to maintain him. 

Provision must also be made before ordering partition in a suit for partition by a brother for the marriage expenses of the unmarried sister or sisters of the brothers. Here there has been a great divergence of views among the writers of digests and commentaries. Kaut. III.5 (quoted below in n. 1181), Viṣụu Dh.9.18. 35 and 15. 31 and Bṭ, simply state that wealth for the marriago expenses of the unmarried sisters must be set apart. But Manu IX, 118, Yāj. II. 124 and Kat. ( 858 ) 1175 state that the brothers should get their unmarried sisters married by giving them one fourth share. The Mit. explains 1176 that this does not mean that each brother is to give one fourth of his share to the sister ( for in that cage if there are five brothers and one unmarried sister she may get more than each brother) but that the unmarried sister is to get one fourth of what she would have got if she were a male and that if a person has sons and daughters from wives of different classes then the unmarried daughter of the wife of each class will take one fourth of what her brother from the same mother would have taken. The Mit. further adds that one should not explain that the word " one fourth" is not to be taken literally and that the unmarried sister gets only as much as is necessary for her marriage, since such an explana tion is opposed to the express words of Manu IX. 118 and since Manu declaress sinfulness as the consequence of not giving one fourth share. The Mit, informs us that its explanation was the same as that of Asahāya and Medhatithi and that Bharuci gave another explanation ( viz. that an unmarried sister was entitled to as much wealth as would be necessary for her

i Vol marriage and not to a definite sbare). The Dayabhaga held the opinion 1177 that if ancestral wealth was, small, the provision for the marriage of the unmarried daughter should be made by giving her a fourth share but if the wealth was ample then she should get only as much as was necessary for her marriage. The 8m. C., V. R. P. 494, V. O. p. 134 follow the view of Bharuci. while the V. M. (p. 106 ), Madaparatna and V. P. (p. 456 ff) follow the Mit. The former group particularly relies on the texts of Devala 11n (wealth necessary for marriage should be given to unmarrled daughters from the paternal estate ), Saṅkha ( when partition of heritage takes place the unmarried daughter takes the maidenly trinkets, wealth for her marriage expenses and stridhana ) and Viṣnu Dh. S. 15. 31. In modern times the Courts allow no share to unmarried daughters but only provt slon for marriage expenses and this too is restricted to the unmarried sister of a person who requires or sues for partition and does not hold good as to the daughters of brothers or other collaterala 1179. In Bhagavati Shukul v. Ram Jatan 45 All. 297 it was held (at p. 299) that "quarter share" in the text means as much money as will suffice for marriage expenses and that where the daughter was a cripple and blind and all the property was worth Rs. 500 an alienation of the whole of it by the widowed mother for raising a dowry for the daughter was justifiable.

Before allotting shares provision must be made out of the jotnt family property for the payment of joint family debts 1879 for the personal debts of the father that are not immoral or Illegal, for small gifts of affection made by the father, the maintenance of disqualified coparoeners and female dependent members and for marriage expenses. Vide Manu VIII. 166 ( as to family debts), Yaj. II. 117, Nar. (dayabhaga 32) and Kst. 850 (for payment of father's debts and gifts of affection) and 542-43 ( for the various legal necessities 118). If brothers want to separate and some of them are already married and others are unmarried then provision must be made for the samskāras (such as marriages) of the latter from the joint family property. Even Kautilya makes provision for the inarriage of unmarried brothers and sistersun. Yaj. II. 124, Nar. ( dayabhaga 33), Br. (S. B.

It has already been seen that a father could during his life time separate his song from himself and also among them Belves 11831 and that he could assign shares of property to his song. This power of the father is indicated even in the Tai. 8. IIL 1. 9. 4 ( quoted above in note 1055 ) which refers to the story of Manu having distributed his wealth among his sons. It is argued by Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 11 that, as this Vedic text (Tai. S.) does not expressly state that any difference was made by Manu as to the shares of his sons, the division must have been equal, that therefore the preference of the eldest son is forbidden by the śāstras and that when the Tai. S. II. 5.2.7 states that "they distinguish the oldest by (a larger share of) the wealth " that is not a rule, but a mere anuvāda ( a statement of fact) and the Vedio passage only recites what some people do in spite of the rule of the gāstras. The general rule, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, is equal distribu tion, as stated in Jai. X. 3. 53 ( samain syād-asrutitvat) which is relied upon by the prima facie view in Mit. on Yāj. II. 265. From the Tai. S. it appears that both practices viz. equal division of property among all sons and giving a larger share to the eldest were wellknown in those far-off ages. Ap. II. 6.

But la Venkatarayudu v. Sivaramkrishnayya 58 Mad. 126 and in Pran jivan v. Motiram 29 Bom. L. R. 1412 it has been held that the decisions in 38 Mad. 556 and in 31 Bom. 54 must be regarded as overruled by the P. C. decision in L. R. 49 I, A. 168, and in 58 Mad. 126 it was held that an unmarried brother is not entitled to bave provision made for his marriage in a decree for partition. It is submitted with great respect that these Madras and Bombay decisions are wrong so far as unmarried brothers are concerned, that they go against the express texts of several writers like Kautilya, Nārada, Bp., Visvarūpa, Madanapārijāta (p. 648) and that the Frivy Council in 49 1. A, 168 was dealing with the provision for marriages of the children of coparceners and not of brothers.

Special share for the eldest son

14. 7. clearly 1188 states that in some countries' gold or black corn or black produce of the earth is the ( special) share of the eldent. Almost all the sūtras and smrtis prescribe the rule of equal division among the sons of wives of the same class as the father (vide Ap. Dh, S. II. 6. 14. 1, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 2-3, Manu IX 156, Yaj. II. 117, Visṇu Dh. S. 18, 36, Kaut. III. 5, Br. S. B. E. 33 p. 371 v. 10, Kāt. 838). Some of these no doubt refer to the special share or provision given to the eldest (called uddhāra). Kaut says " the father in a partition during his own life should not give a special share to one out of several sons, nor should he deprive a son of a share without any .cause 118 ( such as blindness etc.)." Kat. 843 says the same thing in almost the same words. But from certain passages when construed literally (such as Yaj. II. 116, Nār. dāyabhāga 15 ) it appears that the early Indian father often distributed the ancestral wealth among his sons just as he pleased. Nār. ( dāyabhāga 15)1185 says: "When a father has distributed his property amongst his sons that is a lawful distribution for them (and cannot be set aside ), whether the share of one be less or greater than or equal to the shares of the rest; for the father is the lord of all". To the same effect is Br. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 370 v. 4) who adde that if they try to alter the arrangement (made by the father) they shall be punished. But later on these passages were either held to apply to former ages ( V. Mayūkba p. 99 says 80 ) or to the self-acquired property of the father (Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 ) or were so interpreted as to mean that the partition made by the father could not be annulled if it was legal, but if illegal it could be set aside ( Mit, on Yāj. II. 116, Madanaratna, Madanapārijāta p. 646 ). Nār. ( dāyabhāga 16) himself denies authority to the father to give shares to the sons as he pleases

The eldest son has received special treatment in all ages down to modern times (vide p. 566 above). That treatment took various forms. Sometimes the texts say that the eldest son took the whole eatate. Ap. II, 6. 14. 6, Manu IX. 105-107, Nār. (dayabhāga 5) refer to this view. Manu (IX 105-107) allows the eldest son to take the entire paternal estate, provides that the other sons should depend for their maintenance on the oldest son as on the father, remarks that the oldest by the mere fact of his birth enables the father to free himself from the debt to the ancestors and that therefore he (the eldest) deserves to get from the father the entire estate. 1186 

Another mode of dealing with the privileges of the eldest son was to give him some excellent or valuable article and then to distribute the rest equally. The Tai. S. II. 2. 2. 7 seems to have been understood by Ap. Dh. $. II. 6.14. 1 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 2-5 1187 in this sense. Manu IX. 114 says that the eldest may get the best of all the items of wealth, whatever is the most eminent and the best of a group of ten cattle. Br. (8. B. E 38 p. 371 verse 8) is to the same effect. Kaut. IIL 6 points out that according to Usana, among the sons born of the same mother, goats shall be the special share of the oldest among brāhmapas, horses among ksatriyas, Cows among vaisyas and shoop among sūdras, that if there be no quadrupeds. the eldest was to take an additional share of one-tenth of the whole property excepting procious stones, since be releases his father from føtten (of Hell ) by offering sraddha Kaut him solf holds that the eldest should got the vehicle and ornaments of his father after the latter's death }, the middle-most hig bad, best and the bropre plate from which the father took his meals, and the youngest should get black grain (Hke susame ),

iron, domestic utensils and the bullock cart. Hārsta 1188 says : "at a partition the eldest should get a bull, the most precious wealth, the images for worship and the ancestral house, the other brothers should go out and build new houses or if there be a single house the eldest should get the southern (or best) portion". This special allotment to the eldest is called uddhāra (lit. what is first taken out) in Manu IX. 115-116 and Visṇu Dh. S. 18. 37, and Baud, employs the form "uddharet". There were other methods also prescribed for special distribution of wealth, Gaut. 28. 5 says that the eldest should get one-twentieth of the whole as a special share, a bull and a cow, a cow, a chariot to which horses, asses or mules are yoked and a bull. Manu IX. 112 provides that the special share of the eldest was one twentieth of the whole property and whatever was the most valuable out of the ancestral property, the middlemost son should get half of this ( i. e. one-fortieth part) and the youngest one-fourth of this (one-eightieth of the whole ). Manu IX. 117 states that when no valuable items are taken out for the eldest the latter should get two shares, the son next to him one share and a half and the other sons one share each. Vas. 17. 42, Nār. (dāyabhāga 13), Bp. (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 371 verse 9 ) also give two shares to the eldest, the latter 1189 making it to depend on the possession of learning and good qualities by the eldest. Similarly Nār. (dāyabhāga 12), Br. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p.370 verse 5) provide 1190 that when the father makes a division during his lifetime he may retain two shares for himself. Saṅkha-Likhita allowed this right to the father only when he had an only son, 1191

In course of time there was a revulsion of popular feeling against allowing a special share to the eldest son and even to the father, Kāt. (838) 1192 states that where the parents and brothers divide the whole joint property in equal shares that is a just (or legal) division. Br. (S. B. E. 331193 p. 370 verse 2) declares that the father and sons are entitled to equal shares in lands and houses that are ancestral, but in property acquired by the father the sons cannot claim a share against the will of the father. The V. M. (p. 95) remarks on this that it follows impliedly that in the wealth acquired by the grand-father or other (remoter) ancestor, the sons can demand a partition even against the father's desire, 

____According to Manu IX. 125,1194 if all wives of a person are of the same caste, then the son who is born first (even from a wife who is junior i. e, married later ) is the eldest son and that among twins the one that is born first is the eldest (verse 126), just as in the Subrahmanya 1195 texts the invoca tion of Indra is made by the name of the first-born. But if he has wives of different castes then the son of the wife of his own caste is the oldest (though born later) and the son of a wife of a lower caste though born first would be postponed. Devala 11%a quoted in V. R. p. 477 and V. C. p. 128 says the

same as Manu IX, 125. Manu IX. 123 and Gaut. 28. 16 appear to conflict with Manu IX. 125 and probably refer to some other ancient text or opinion. The V. Mayūkha (pp. 97-98) notes that in some medical works and in the (commentary on the ) Bhāgavata Purāpa III. 17. 18, it is said that among twins the one born later is deemed to be the elder, but that this, being opposed to the indications contained in the Vedic Subrahmanya formula and in Manu IX. 126, has no bearing here (but only in medical matters ). The Nirnayasindhu (HII Pūrvārdha p. 251 ) makes a reference to the Bhagavata. 

General feeling went so much against allowing & special share to the eldest or allowing the father to make an unequal division among his song, that such action was condemned in the same breath with niyoga, 1196 or the sacrifice of the cow called Anubandhyā. It is very instructive to follow the agruments of the Mit. and other writers on this point. The oldest extant commentator, Medhātithi, on Manu IX. 112 shows that even before his time there were writers that held that the texts of Manu on niyoga and on the special share to the eldest at a partition were in vogue only in bygone days and not in their days, that the rules of the smrtis were conditioned by time and country, just as satłras of long duration, though declared in the Vedic texts committed to memory by Vedic students, were not being performed and just as Manu (I. 85 ) declares that the dharmas were different in different yugas. But Medhātithi 1199 does not accept this reasoning, denies that different dharmas are prescribed for different yugas and holds that there is no restriction as to the dharmas to be performed in a country. Though sattras may not be performed now still it is possible to perform them. The argument of the Mit. on Yāj.

II. 117 is briefly as followg1198-Unequal division though found in the sāstras (e. g. Manu IX. 105, 112, 116, 117, Yaj. II. 114) should not be practised because it has come to be condemned (or has become hateful to ) by the people, since there is the prohibition (in Yaj. L 156 ) that an action, though prescribed in the śāstras, should not be performed when it has come to be condemned by the people, since such an action does not lead to the attainment of Heaven. For example, though Yāj. I. 109 prescribes the offering of a big ox or a goat to a learned brahmaṇa guest, it is not now practised because people have come to hate it; or just as, although there is a Vedic text laying down the sacrificing of a COW "one should sacrifice a barren cow called anubandhyā for Mitra and Varuṇa", still it is not done because people condemn it. And it has been said "just as the practice of niyoga or the killing of the anubandhya cow is not now in vogue, so also division after giving a special share ( to the eldest son) does not now exist". Āpastamba also ( II. 6. 14. 1-14) prescribes equal division, refers to the view of some that the eldest takes the whole estate, shows that allotting a special share to the eldest is the view of some and refutes it as opposed to the śāstras by quoting the Vedic text "Manu divided his wealth among his sons". Therefore unequal division though found in the sāstra should not be practised as it is opposed to popular sentiments and to the Veda and so Yāj. (II. 117 ) gives the restrictive rule that in partitioning there must be equal divi sion, The Sm. C. (II. p. 266 ) tells us that Dhāreśvara also did not discuss passages like Manu IX. 112 since he said that - the practice (of uddhāravibhāga) had been altogether given up by the people 1199

Divergent views on uddhāra-vibhaga 

629 

The Sm.C. finde fault with Visvarūpa for saying that just as the offering of an ox or a goat to a learnod brāhmaṇa is not practised because the practice of the sistas is against it, 80 uddhāra is not practised. It says that when there is a conflict between a smrti text and diṣtācūra, the latter is the weaker ( of the two) and cannot refute the smṛti text as laid down by Vas. 14-5. Further not offering a bull cannot be said to be sistācāra, but it is really the absence of sistā cāra. The Sm. C. finds fault with the Mit. for saying that people have come to condemn a special share for the eldest. It says that, on the contrary, if a special share is given to the eldest who is endowed with learn ing, good qualities or holy actions then people commend such a procedure. The Madanaratna 1200 quotes the verse “yatha niyoga &c.," and a verse from the Adipurāṇa. The V. P. 1201 (pp. 442-443) generally follows the Mit., but criticizes it by saying that there is no real śruti-rirodha ( opposition to a Vedio text). If that were so, as śruti (the Veda) is promulgated for all ages, unoqual division would be forbidden in all ages and it would follow that the particular sruti passages speaking of

unequal division are without authority, since it (unequal divi sion) could not have been practised in other ages also (but as a matter of fact it was ); besides Baud. sets out another Vedic text which mentions unequal division. The V. P, desiring to guard against the rather wide statement that whatever is condemned by the people should not be practised holds that the word "loka" in Yāj. I 156 means "yuga "; otherwise there would be confusion about what is proper conduct and what does not lead to Heaven. The condemnation by low or ordinary people who are quite innocent of śāstras cannot make an action incapable of leading to Heaven, since such people might con demn the hiinsa ( slaughter ) of the animal offered to Agni and Soma. The above discussion illustrates how practices once recognized by Vedic passages and by the people gradually fell into disuetude and how reason and the common sense of ordinary people asserted themselves even against Vedic and smrti texts. The Mit. is very clear in its statement that whatever comes to be hated by the people in general should not be practised, even though it was once practised and has the support and authority of Vedic and smrti texts behind it, Those who desire change in social customs and the practices of the people in various directions rely on this text of Yaj. and on similar texts 1202 of Manu IV. 176 and Viṣnu Dh. S. 71. 85 and on the Mit. for authority. Orthodox writers like Mitramitra therefore have to twist plain words like " loka", since they cannot tolerate the idea that common people can have anything to say in what these writers believe to be the injunctions of the sāstra. Instead of candidly saying that ancient practices came to be modified by common people, writers like Mitramiśta say that common people should not be listened to in these matters, that each yuga has its own peculiar practices and that common people have no authority to change gastric practices prescribed by the texts for a particular age: It is sheer quibbling to say that not offering a bull is not sistacara, but absence of siṣtācāra; what is clear is that common people abhorred the practice of niyoga and the killing of a cow in a sacrifice and writers of sūtras and smrtis fell into line with them and probibited such practices in the

Vestiges of larger share to eldest son

Kali age, though they were either permitted or ( oven ) enjoined by the Vedic texts; that is, the voice of the common man or his revolt was allowed to prevail over the word of the sacred Veda. 

Though the assignment of a larger share to the eldest son or giving him the whole property ceased to be generally prevalent, vestiges of it are still found. There are certain estates in the nature of zamindaries or a rāj that are impartible and descend by the rule of primogeniture to a single heir. Vide Baboo Gunesh Dutta v. Maharaja Moheshur 6 Moo. I A. 164, Neelkisto v. Beer Chunder 12 Moo. L. A. 523, Mohesh v. Satrughan 29 I. A. 62, Ram Nundun v. Maharani Janki 29 L A, 178 for examples of impartible estates. Sometimes by custom certain estates such as Deshmukh and Deshpande valuns have been held to be impartible. Vide Ramrao v. Yeshvantrao 10 Bom. 327 and Gopalrao v. Trimbakrao 10 Bom. 598. In certain other cases a larger share ( called jyesthāṁsa or notap) has been allowed by custom to the eldest son at a partition, Vide Munikclund v. Hiralal 20 Cal. 45 (P. O.), Prithisingjā v.

The following propositions may be laid down about the allotment of shares on a partition: (1) When there is a parti tion between a father and his sons each son takes a share equal to that of the father; (2) where the partition is only between brothers all of them share equally; (3) on the death of a member leaving male issue his right to a share on partition passes to and is represented by his male issue ; (4) when there is a partition among members who are uncles and nephews or cousins, the allotment is per stirpes (according to the stock) as regards each branch and per capita among the members of the same branch. This rule is expressly laid down 1203 by Kaut.

Bays: "if an undivided younger brother dies, he (the elder brother or the other brother ) should make the son of the former a partaker of the ancestral wealth, when he has not obtained from his grandfather livelihood ( i. e. share of heritage ); he should obtain from his paternal uncle or the uncle's son the share which his father would have got (if alive); that very share would be the share according to law of all the brothers ( who are the sons of the deceased brother ). Or even a son (of that son of the brother dying) would obtain that share ; beyond this (I. e. beyond the grandson of the deceased brother) there is cessation (of the right to demand a share)". It was stated that in the ancestral property (paitāmaha drarya) sons and grandsons equally have rights by birth, but in the case of the grandsons assigninent of shares is made to them through their

The first verse of Kāt. starts with the words of wine and therefore the topic is that of undivided family and there is no express indication that it has changed to reunion in the following verse.

Suppose A, the head of a Hipdu joint family, dies leaving four song, B, C, D, E and five grand-sons, B1, B2, B3, C1, D1 and then B dies. Then B3 receives his share, which is one third of one-fourth ( =one-twelfth ), goes out of the family and the rest oontinue joint. Then C dies, then D, then E, and thon B2. Then B 1 sues C1 and D1 for his share. Here if we again apply the rule of per stirpes division, the property that remained at the date of the suit of B1 will be divided into three parts and B1, C1 and D1 ( who represent three stocks, B, C, D) will each get one third of that property. This was so decided in Pranjivandas v. Ichharam 39 Bom. 734. The Madras High Court, however, holds that the rule of per stirpes applies only wlien all the coparceners desire a partition at the same time and that if only some members separate at one time and others on a later occasion, regard should be had to the share allotted at the first partition in computing the share to be allotted at the second partition. That is, according to the Madras High Court in the above case B1 will be entitled to one-third minus one twelth (which latter was allotted to B 3 when he left the family). The Madras High Court says that its views are based not on strict principles of Hindu Law, but on necessary con siderations of equity. Vide Manjunatha v. Narayana 5 Mad. 362 and Narayana v. Shankar 53 Mad. 1 (F. B. at p. 6). 

Manu (IX. 47) emphatically states : 12034 “once is a parti. tion made, once is a maiden given in marriage, once does a man say I shall make a gift of this or that'; these three are done only once by the good". This means that a partition once made is final and cannot ordinarily be reopened. But there are excep tions to this rule. One viz. about the posthumous son born after partition has already been mentioned above ( pp. 595-597 ). Bp. 1204 (S. B. E. 33 pp. 373-74 verses 24-26 ) says, “If a man

leaving the country common to himself and his co-sharors goes to another country, his share niust undoubtedly be given to his descendant when the latter comes back to the original country. Whether he (the descendant) be the third or fifth or even seventh in descent (from the man who left the country ) he would get the share that descends hereditarily provided his birth and family name are ascertained. The gotrajas ( agnatic members of the family) should allow (a share in the ancestral) lands to the descendant of a man whom the maulas and neighbours know to be a co-owner (in the lands) by descent, when he comes ( after a partition) to demand his share". The V. R. explaing 1205 that the rule of Devala (given above ) about a claim to a share being allowed up to the fourth applies when all the members stay together in the same place or country, while the above rule of Bṛ, allowing even the seventh in descent to claim his share after a partition has taken place applies where such descendant and his forefathers had migrated to a distant land. These rules of Br. indicate that, even after a long time, a descendant could claim his share in a joint family estate and no bar of limitation was allowed. 

Another rule is that where some property of the joint family had been fraudulently concealed by one member and was dis covered afterwards, or where some property was left out from partition either through mistake or accident, such property should be divided according to their shares among the persons who made the first partition. In this case there is no reopening of the partition once made, but there is another partition. Manu IX. 218, Yaj. II. 126, Kaut. III. 5 and Kāt. 885-86 laý down 1206 this.

is afterwards discovered, the sons should divide it equally with their brothers in the absence of the father (i. e: even after his death). Whatever is concealed from each other (by the co sharers ) or what was divided in an unjust manner and whatever was recovered (such as debts) after partition) should be 

partitioned in equal shares. This is the view of Bhrgu', 

In the Alt. Br. (VI. 7) 1207 It is said: 'He who deprives & person entitled to a share of his share, him he (who is deprived) punishes (or destroys). If he does not punish (or destroy ) him (the depriver), then he punishes his son or grandson; but he does punish him'. Manu IX. 213 declares that even the eldest brother who through grad deprives his younger brothers (of their shares ) ceases to be the eldest (1. e. forfeits his posi tion as the oldest), is deprived of his ( special) share (as eldest) and should be punished by the king. From these passages it follows that fraudulently concealing joint property or depriving a person of his share is condemned. This leads on to a divergence of views among commentators and digests. If a man conceals joint property at a partition, is he a wrongdoer or not? What he conceals is partly his own. Therefore the Dayabhāga 1208 (XIII. 8) holds that there is no theft in this case, since a thief is commonly understood to be one who knowing that some thing belongs to another, makes it his own without any ground for so doing; while a co-sharer cannot be said to be no owner at all of the joint property. The Dayabhāga (XII. 11-12) says that Visvarūpa and Jitendriya both held the same opinion that even if technically it may be called theft, still there is no sin attaching to it as smrtis allow bim also who conceals joint property to share in it at the subsequent partition, The Vivādaratnākara (p.526) states that Halāyudha also held the opinion that in suppressing some joint property the co-sharer did not incur the sin of theft. On the other hand the Mit., Apararka (p. 732), V. P. p. 555 hold that in view of Manu IX. 213

Concealment of joint property 

637 

(which declares even the oldest as punishable by the king if he deprives his younger brothers of their due share ) and the Ait. Br. there is the fault of theft in case a co-sharer fraudulently conceals joint property. The Mit, and V. P. further rely upon an example derived from the Pūrvamimārsā in support of their view. When a caru (boiled food) of mudga pulse is prescribed and mudgas are not available, some substitute must be employed just as when rice is not available nivara grain may be employed. The parts of māsa resemble those of mudga and some one may plausibly say that in the absence of mudgas, a caru of masas may be used. To this Jai. VI. 3. 20 1209_replies that, since maṣas, varakas and kodravas are forbidden as being unfit for use in sacrifices, one cannot take parts of māsas as substitute for parts of mudgas though both may be so similar as not to be easily distinguishable. So the general prohibition against depriving another of his wealth holds good even in the case of goods that belong jointly to oneself and to others. The Dayabhāga (XIII. 16 pp. 227-228) tells us that a predecessor of it named Balaka relied on this very nyāya of Jaimini and finds fault with him. It should be noted however that Kat. (888) re commends that the king 1210 even if a complaint be lodged about fraudulent suppression by a co-sharer should not use force against the fraudulent suppressor but should make him give up the concealed property by persuasion or trick, Bp. and Kāt. 1711 declare that if there is a suspicion that some joint wealth has been concealed by a co-sharer, the kota ordeal may ba resorted to.

. If there was a dispute whether a partition had already taken 

place, Yaj. II. 149 mentions some of the indications that lead to the inference or proof of partition viz. 'the determination of the dispute follows from the testimony of kinsmen, cognates (like maternal uncle), other witnesses, a deed (of partition) and by ( the fact of ) houses and fields being separately held.' Nār. ( dayabhāga 36-41 ) gives more 1112 elaborate rules on the subject viz, that the status of division can be determined from the fact of their transactions ( agriculture &c.) being separate, that the separate performance of religious rites is another indication of separation. “Receiving and returning a debt, the beasts (kine &o.), food, houses and fields and servants must be separate in the case of those who are divided, as also cooking food, performance of religious rites, income and expenditure. It is only divided persons ( and not undivided ones) that can become in respect of each other witnesses, sureties or debtors and creditors. People should regard them to be divided even though there be no deed of partition, in whose case these transactions are entered into openly with their co-sharers'. Yāj. II. 52 also declares that between brothers, husband and wife, father and gon there cannot be, as long as they are undivided, the relation ship of being sureties or witnesses for each other or of being debtor and creditor. Nar. ( dāyabhāga 41 ) and Kāt. ( 893 ) state that when for ten years brothers (and other members of a family) reside (separately) doing religious observances separately and have separate transactions, they should be known as separate so far as the ancestral estate is concerned. 1213 It is on account of these passages that the courts say that presumably every Hindu family is joint in food, worship 1214 and estate and that cesser of commensality is an element which may properly be considered in determining the question whether there has been

Self-acquired property 

639 

a partition of joint family property, but it is not conclusive 185 Bp, says that where there are no witnesses nor a document to prove partition, a conclusion may be arrived at by inference, 

A few words may be said about the self-acquired property of the father or grand-father. According to the strict theory of the Mit. the son 1316 acquires by birth an interest even in the self-acquired property of the father, but the Mit, makes it clear that the son has no power to prevent his father from disposing of his own self-acquisitions, but has to give his approval to his father's alienations of his self-acquisitions, The Mit. sets out two smrti texts viz.' though immovable property and bipeds may have been acquired by the father himself, there can be no gift nor sale of them without (calling together or ) consulting all the sons. Those that are born, those that are unborn and those that are in their mother's ) womb expect maintenance (and therefore ) there can be no gift nor sale'. But these have been treated by the Mit, and the Dayabhaga also as more or less recommendatory. If the father alienates his self-acquisitions without his son's consent he may be held guilty of transgressing a smrti precept but the transaction does hold good and is valid, 1217 since a fact cannot be altered by even a hundred texts ( as the Dāyabhāga puts it). It should not be supposed that the Mit. was the first to propound this right as to self-acquisitions. Centuries before, the Viṣnu Dh. 8. 17. 1 expressly declared that as regards self-acquired property the father has absolute discretion to divide it as he pleases.

Kat. (839) also says that the son has no ownership in the father's self-acquisition. 118 When Yaj. II. 114 allows the father either to give the best share to the eldest son or to make an equal division among all sons, the Mit. explains that this unequal division holds good only as to the self-acquisitions of the father. Similarly when Nār. (dāyabhaga 12 ) or Saṅkha-Likhita say that the father may take two shares for himself, that is with reference to se]fwacquisitions, acc. to the Mit. Manu IX. 104 stating that sons have no power over property during the life of the parents refers to the self-acquisitions of the parents. In modern times courts have followed the view that a Hindu father (or any Hindu person whatever ) may give, sell or bequeath by will his self acquired property ( whether movable or immovable) to any body he likes ( vide Rao Balwant Singh v. Rani Kishori 25 I. A. p. 54 at pp. 67-68 where the two verses cited by the Mit. were held to contain only a moral precept and not a rule of law capable of being enforced ). 

Mr. Kishori Lal Sarkar in his Tagore Law Lectures on the Mimāngā rules of interpretation states (p. 21 ) that 'Mitakṣarā bears the imprens of Buddhistic influence'. For this proposition he advances hardly any substantial evidence that will bear scrutiny. His reasons are mostly subjective and he refers to no ancient or medioval Buddhistic texts that elaborate the principle of taking property by birth or the rule of propinquity in deciding questions of inheritance, which two are the most fundamental, tenets of the Mitakṣarā system. It appears that the evolution of the son's right to partition, of his equality with his father, of the absolute rights of a person to his self acquisitions was a gradual indigenous growth and had nothing to do with Buddhistio thought. Buddhists had hardly any independent set of juristic ideas or works different from those of the Brahmanioal jurists and in medieval times countries like Burma professing Buddhism turned to Brahmanic codes like that of Manu for regulating succession, inheritance and allied

In the preceding pages reference las been frequently made to sons, to their rights in ancestral property by birth and to their shares on partition. It is now time to refer to the various kinds of sons, principal ( mukhya) and gauna (subsidiary or secondary ). 

In H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 560-561 passages from the Rgveda, the Tai, S., Sat. Br., Ait. Br., the sūtras and smrtis emphasizing the importance of a son for the spiritual welfare of a man have been cited. The principal purposes served by the birth of a son are succinctly stated in the Ait. Br. 33. 1. viz. the son enables the father to pay off the debt he owes to his ancestors, to secure immortality (ammtatva ) and heavenly worlds. These were the main purposes deemed to be served by a son in most remote times. Manu (IX. 106-107 ) and Yāj. I. 78 also mention these benefits. The desire was to continue and perpetuate the family (vaméasya avicchedah as the Mit. has it) and to provide for the performance and preservation of religious sācra and offerings. This desire was common in ancient societies almost everywhere. The Sat. Br. XII. 4.3.1 (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 157) states the father in later life subsists on the son and the son in early life subsists on the father'. The Nirukta 1220 (III. 4) quotes a ?k verge thou

art börn from each of the limbs, from the heart ( of the father ), thou art indeed one's own self called son; mayst though live for a hundred autumns!'. Gradually the idea arose ( probably suggested by etymologists) that the son saved the father from the Hell called put, 1221 as stated by Manu IX. 138 (=Adiparva 229. 14 = Visnu Dh. S. 15. 44). The son's close connection with the offering of pipdas to the ancestors is not much emphasized in the oldest works. But in the sūtras, in Manu and the other smrtis this aspect of the benefits derived from the son is far more prominent than the others. In speaking of the putrika putra Manu (IX. 136 ) declares 'he should offer pinda' (to his maternal grandfather ) and take the latter's wealth. As three descendants (son, grandson and great-grandson) presented pindas to the ancestor, all three had extravagant praises besto wed on them. Manu IX. 137 says: 'a man secures the ( higher) worlds through (the birth of ) a son, he obtains permanence (in those worlds ) through a grandson, through the son of a grandson he wins the world of the Sun '1222, The Viṣnudharma sūtra 85. 67 declares1223 ' A man should desire to have many song (with the thought) that some one out of them may go to Gayā or offer the Aśvamedha sacrifice or let loose ( in honour of the deceased father ) a dark bull'. Bf. (g. in Par. M. I. % p. 305 ) states: 'the pitṛs afraid of falling into Hell desire to have sons; (they think ) one of them may go to Gay, and that one will save us; he will set at liberty a bull, he may perform sacrifices and execute works of public utility (like tanks, temples and parks ), he will take care of us in our old age, he will offer srāddha day by day'. The Matsyapurana 204 (3-17 ) contains verses that are called pritrgāthās, verses sung by pitṛs ) which breathe the bankerings of deceased ancestors after what

they expect their descendants to do such as offering water in holy rivers, sraddhas, going to Gaya, gifts of various kinds, construction of tanks, &o. 

It is not, however, to be supposed that purely secular bene fits to be derived from sons were not thought of at all. People were alive to them but those benefits were submerged under the flood of extravagant ideas about the spiritual benefits derived froin sons. For example, the Br. 1224 Up. I. 5. 16, after mention ing the three worlds of men, pitts and gods, declares that the world of men can be won only through the son ( while in I. 5.17 there is eulogy of the son and instruction to him that he is Brahma, he is yajña, he is the heavenly world). Nār. IV. 5 says 1225 "fathers wish to have sons on their own account think ing in their hearts . He will free me from low and high debts'". Kāt. (551) has a similar verse and makes the meaning of Nār, clear 1236 Vide above (under ppādāna pp. 416-417). 

Besides the aurasa, eleven or twelve kinds of subsidiary sons are mentioned by most ancient smrti writers. Ap. Dh. S. does not recognize any son except the aurasa. Āp. quotes certain verses which express the view of an ancient sage called Aupajanghani and which are also quoted by the Baud. Dh. S. according to which the aurasa was to be recognized as the only son (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 602 n. 1417 for the quotation) Āp. II. 5. 13. 10 emphasizes that there can be no real gift or sale of one's child ( dānam krayadharmascāpalyasya nu vidyate). But Ap. Dh. S. clearly shows that it know that køetraja sons were

In II. 6. 13. 1-51277 it states, * sons begotten by a man, who approaches in the proper season a woman of equal caste that has not belonged to another man (as wife ) and that has been married to him according to the śāstras, have the privilege to follow the occupations (peculiar to their castes ) and to inherit property; if a man has sexual intercourse with a woman who had been married before to another or was not married legally to him or belongs to a different caste, they both incur sin and through that ( i. e. their sinfulness ) the son also becomes sinful'. In II. 10. 27. 2-6 Āp. condemns the practice of niyoga 'a husband (or his elders ) shall not appoint a wife who occupies the position of a sagotra to others (who are not sagotra), for they declare that a bride is given to the family ( of the husband and not to the husband alone ). This (practice of appointment) is forbidden (now) on account of the weakness of (men's ) senses. The hand of even a sagotra is ( deemed in law to be ) that of a stranger, as well as that of any other person (except the husband).

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol, 

Viṛpu Dh. 8. (15. 27) mentions yatra-kvacanotpadita' (procreated anywhere ) as the 12th and last. The com. Vaijay anti explains it in two ways: (1) procreated by a person on a woman, regardless of whether she is his own or another's wife or whether she is of the same caste or not, whether she is married or unmarried, whether her marriage has been consummated or not; (2) the son of a man from a sūdra woman not married to him. Even in the last sense he cannot be called sandra ( whom Manu IX. 178 and Yāj. I. 91 de fine as the son of a sūdra wife from a brāhmaṇa ). Hārita as quoted in the V. R. p. 549 men tions a son called 'sahasā dṛgta '( seen by chance ), who seems to be probably the same as kftrima. The saudra is omitted by several writers (even ancient ones ) like Gautama, Kautilya and Hārita. Manu speaks of only twelve sons (IX. 158) and does not enumerate the putrikāputra among them, though he speaks of the putrikā (IX. 127 and 134 and elsewhere ) as equal to the son. It is therefore that Br. ( S. B. E. 33 p. 375 verse 33 ) states that of the thirteen sons mentioned in succession by Manu the legitimate son of the body ( aurasa ) and the putrikā (the daughter appointed as a son) continue 'the family. Vas. 17.12 emphatically declares (dvādata ityeva putrāḥ purūnadrṣtah) that only twelve sons have. been noticed by the ancient (sages) and it is no doubt true that most writers generally enumerate twelve. A smrti text quoted by Haradatta on Gautama and by the Dattaka-mimamsā mentions 15 kinds of song. Vide note below 1229 The number is arrived at by counting the putrika

( daughter appointed as a son ) and the putrikāputra ( the son of the appointed daughter ) as two, dividing the kṣetraja into two viz, as the son of the begetter (bijin) and as the son of the wife (i. e. of the husband of the wife ) and the son produced any where ( as mentioned by Visṇu Dh. S.) is 15th and the last. The Parāśarasmrti (IV. 23-24) mentions, besides Kunda and Golaka, only five kinds of song, 

It is necessary, before proceeding further, to give brief definite ions of the twelve or thirteen kinds of sons from Manu and other writers. The legitimate son (aurasa) is one begotten by a man on his own wedded wife of the same caste. The putrikāputra 1230 is of two kinds; (1) a sonless man may appoint his daughter as his son ( she is then called putrikā and treated as a son ); (2) or she may be given to a person in marriage with the stipulation 'I. give you in marriage this brotherless girl decked with orna ments; the son born of her will be my son'. In this case the son born of the daughter so given becomes the son of his mater nal grandfather. The kṣetraja (the son of the wife ) is one who is begotten on a man's wife (or widow ) by a sagolra ( agnatic kinsman) or by one not of the same gotra, according to the rules of niyoga, when the man himself is either dead or impotent or suffering from (an incurable ) disease. That is the son given (dattaka or dattrima ) whom his father or mother gives as a son affectionately in a time of distress with water and who is of the same caste ( as the adopter). He is the son called kṣtrima (made ) whom a man makes his son, the latter being of the same caste, being clever in distinguishing between right and wrong and being endowed with the qualities a son should POSBOBs. He is the son born secretly (gūdhotpanna or gūdhaja as he is called by Baud, and Yāj.), who is born in a man's house, it being not known who is his begetter; and he belongs to him of whose wife he is bora. He is the son called apaviddha (cast off ) whom a man receives as his son after he has been abandoned by his parents or by one of them. The kūnina ( mai den's son ) is one whom a maiden bears secretly in the house of her father and he belongs to him who marries her afterwards.

The sahodha (received together with the bride ) is the son born of a woman who was pregnant at the time of marriage, whether that fact was known or unknown (to the person marrying hor) and he belongs to the person who weds the (pregnant) woman, The krita ( son bought ) is one who is bought by a person from his father and mother for making the boy his son, whether the boy be equal or unequal (in qualities ). The paunarbhava ( the son of a remarried woman) is one to whom a woman, being aban doned by her husband or being a widow, gives birth after she contracts a second inarriage of her own accord. He, who, having lost his parents or being abandoned by them without proper cause, gives hinself to a man ( as a son) is called svayardattu (a son self-given). The son whom a brāhmaṇa begets through lust from a sūdra wife is called pāraśava (or saudra ), since he, though living, is (like a ) corpse. 

The list of twelve or thirteen kinds of sons looks rather formidable, has puzzled and misled even great scholars into making all sorts of sweeping assertions and putting forward untenable theories about the origin and necessity of so many song. For example, Dr. Jolly in his ' Recht und Sitte' (English tr. p. 156 ) observes. The twelve kinds of sonship, which to some extent are based on the illicit connection of the mother and for the greater part have nothing to do with the blood-relationship of the son with the father, are probably the most striking feature of Indian family law. The cause of this abnormal importance being attached to male issue is to be sought, according to the smrtis, in the offering of sacrifices to the manes which depends upon the male issue; yet, however, originally an economic motive was perhaps a more important factor in it-to get for the family as many powerful workers as possible'. The learned writer appears to hold that the smstis regarded all the secondary sons as equally competent to confer spiritual benefit and that at one and the same time a man could have all or most of them As song. But he is mistaken in both these respects. The very definition of putrikāputra, kṣetraja 1231 and dattaka given by many of the smptis show that one who has already an aurasa

Twelve lands of sons classified

son, grandson or great-grandson could not have a putrikaputra, a kṣetraja or an adopted son. If the definitions of all the 1% or 13 kinds of sons are carefully analysed, it will be quite apparent that the long list is due to the ancient writers' great penchant for divisions and sub-divisions based upon very slight differences of circumstances. The several kinds can be classi fied into three or four groups as done by Devala, 1232 All the five sons called duttaka, krita, kṣtrima, svayandatta and apaviddha are sons who are affiliated by a person under various circumst ances. There is no tinge of any illicit connection of the mother in any one of these, the one thing common to all of them being that they are the sons of one man and are treated by another as his. Similarly the paunarbhava and saudra are the legal sons of the man himself, but there is opprobrium attaching to them, because in the first case the mother contracted a re marriage ( which was very much condemned by the smrtis ) and in the other a brābmana married a sūdra woman ( which also was looked down upon, if not absolutely forbidden as done by Yāj. I. 56). The paunarbhava son of a dvija is still called a dvija by Manu III. 181, but Manu only provides that he is not fit to be invited at a sraddha. The putrika ( the daughter appointed as a son ) is the man's own child and the putrika putra also is the man's own grandchild and both these are special cases of adoption and no question of mother's illicit connection arises in these. So out of 13 kinds of sons, nine were entirely free from any taint of illicit connection. There remain only the four viz, kṣetraja, gūdhotpanna, kānina, sahodha. The kṣetraja was in a class by himself and was & survival of an ancient practice prevalent in many countries all the world over, which had been condemned in India by Ap. ( as shown above on p. 644) and his predecessors several centuries before the Christian era. It may, however, be pointed out that some medieval writers held the view that several secondary sons like the dattaka, krita &o. could be had by a man having no auraga son. 12324

History nf Dharmattistra 

(Vol. 

The chief concern of the smrtis as shown clearly by the Anusāganaparva (chap. 49 quoted above on p. 645 ) and the com. of Nilakantha was to provide for the maintenance and the performance of the baṁskaras of those children that may be either abandoned by their parents or may be under the oloud of illegitimacy. 

There is great confusion and contradiction among the sūtras and smrtis about the place of the several kinds of sons and about their rights. For example, Gautama (probably the most ancient among extant sūtrakāras ) assigns the 10th place to the putrikāputra, while Baud., Kaut., Yaj, Bf. and Dovala give him the 2nd place and Vasiṣtha, Saṅkha-Likhita, Nār., and Viṣnu put him 3rd. The dattaka, is placed very low in the list by most works except by Manu, Gaut., Baud., Bf. and Brahmapurāṇa (which put him 3rd or 4th). The 12 kinds are put in two groups by some works. Gaut. ( 28. 30-31 ) provides that the aurasa, ksetraja, datta, kptrima, gūdhotpanna and apaviddha are rikthabhājah (take the wealth) and also belong to the gotra of the man whose sons they are, while the other six take only the gotra but not the wealth. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 36-37) employs the same words rikthabhājah and gotrabhājah but differs from Gaut. in including putrikāputra among'rikthabhājah' and omitting him from the group of 'gotrabhāja” .. 1233 Another division (each having six kinds ) is into bandhu-dāyāda or dāyādabāndhava (Manu IX. 158-159 and Nār, dāyabhāga 47) and adāyā dabāndhava (Manu IX. 160, Vas. 17. 38, Nār. dāyabhāga. 47). The first group, acc. to Manu, comprises aurasa ( also putrikā ), kṣetraja, datta, kptrima, gūdhotpanna and apaviddha. They are so called because they take the wealth of their father and also of his kinsmen (in the absence of nearer heirs ), while the members of the 2nd group (whick aco. to Manu IX. 160 comprises kānina,

Here also there is no agreement among the emptis. Vas. (17. 5-25), Saṅkha-Likhita (g. in V. Rp. 247), Nār. dāyabhāga 47 and Hārita include in the first group aurasa, kṣetraja, putrikāputra, paunarbhava, kānina and gūdhaja and the rest in the 2nd group. Kaut. asserts that only the aurasa son succeeds as heir to the kingmen of his father while the others ( that are not procreated by him) succeed only to the father who brings them up, but not to his kinsmen. Yāj. II. 132 states that each of the twelve kinds mentioned by him takes the wealth of the father and offers pinda to him in default of the preceding one and further requires that this is so only if it is certain that the sons are of the same caste as that of the father. Gaut. 28, 32 states that 1234 the kānina and the other sons called gotrabhājaḥ (in 28. 31 ) take only one fourth of the estate of the father if no aurasa nor any of the other sons called rildhabhājah exists (and the rest of the estate is taken by the sapipdas ), while Kaut., Devala and Kat. ( 857 ) state that the dattaka, kṣetraja and other kinds of sons are entitled to one third share only if an aurasa is born provided they are of the same varna and that if they are of a different caste, they are only entitled to food and raiment. If & man, having no son, made his daughter a putrikā or thinking himself to be impotent bad a kṣetraja son or adopted a son and then an aurasa son was born, difficult questions of the dis tribution of his property arose on which there was no un. animity. Manu IX. 163 says that only the aurasa son is entitled to all the paternal wealth and all the other kinds should be given maintenance in order to avoid the fault of being cruel. But as regards the case where a putrika is first made and then an aurasa is born Manu (IX. 134 ) presoribes that these two should divide the paternal estate equally,1235 while

(Vol. 

Manu IX. 164 asks the aurasa to give 1/5 or 1/6 of the paternal wealth to the kṣetraja. This confusion and contradiction about the places and the shares of the several song leads one to infer that the institution of several kinds of sons was not very oommon or generally recognized, was rather confined to some localities or communities and was dying out even in the times of the ancient smrtis, if it ever existed in full force at all at any time. 

As regards gūdhaja, kānina and sahodha there is this to be said. They were the result of illicit connection ; but some one had to maintain them, to bring them up and be their guardian. The emptis when they assign these as the sons of tbe husbands of the women of whom they are born are really providing for these matters of maintenance and guardianship. Br. says that dattaka, apaviddha, krita, krta, and saudra, if of pure caste and pure actions, are middling, while the kṣetraja, paunar bhava, kānlna, sahodha and gūdhaja are condemned hy the good (S. B. E. 33 p. 376 verses 40-41 ). 1236 The kanina was to be under the guardianship of the father of the girl ( Yāj. II. 129 ) till she remained unmarried, but when she married the damsel's Bon came under the dominion of the person who married her ( Manu IX. 172). The very fact that the kanina was assigned to the husband who married the girl shows that this was done because it was deemed that by marrying such a girl the husband condoned her past lapses. Similarly in the case of sahodha, it was deemed that either the child must have been procreated by the husband himself before marriage or that he condoned the conduct of the wife. It appears to have been thought that when the husband (the party most concerned) did not openly object it was not open or allowable for any one else even by proof that the child was kānina or sahodha to call

for the abandonment of the child. Similar remarks apply to the gūdhaja. As shown in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 571-573 if the wife was guilty of adultery the husband had certain powers of correction over the wife, but if he chose to be complaisant, then the smrtis did not compel him to disown or abandon the child. These very smstis (like Gautama, Vas., Nār.) that are very harsh on women for adultery allow the gūdhaja, kānina and sahodha to be secondary sons. So the only way in which these two attitudes can be reconciled is by holding that when the husband condones moral lapses on the part of the woman whom he had accepted as his wife the smṛtis provide for the maintenance, guardianship and succession of such offspring of illicit connection. Even among medieval commentators there was divergence about paunarbhava, kanina, sahodha and gūdhaja; Medhatithi on Manu IX, 181 holds that they are entitled to nothing but food and raiment in any case, while the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 132 ) holds that even the kanina and the rest take the father's wealth in default of aurasa and the other kinds of sons. The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 90) however holds that kānina, sahodha and gūdhaja being the outcome of adultery cannot be savarna with the husband of their mother, are really different froin savarpa sons and even anuloma and pratiloma song. 

A good deal can be said about the spiritual benefit supposed to be derived from secondary song. 

The high eulogy bestowed on the son in the Vedic and smrti literature has reference only to the aurrisu son. Manu IX. 180 asserts that the eleven kinds of sons viz. kṣetraja and the rest (except aurasa and putrikā) are merely substitutes for the real son, adınitted to prevent the cessation of religious rites and in IX. 181 Manu states the final conclusion that such sons as the kṣetraja that are procreated from the seed of others really belong to him from whose seed they spring and not to the other man (who takes them up ). Br. 1237 (S B. E, 33 p. 375 verges 35-36) declares : 'thirteen sons were enumerated in

order by Manu, out of whom only the aurasa and putrikā are the cause of propagating the line. Just as oil is declared by the good to be a substitute (in sacrifices ) in the absence of clarified butter, so the eleven kinds of sons in the absence of aurasa and putrikā 1238 ( are admitted merely as substitutes and not the real thing ).' Although Yāj. II. 132 declares that each succeeding one out of the twelve kinds of sons takes the estate in the absence of each preceding one and offers pinga to the deceased owner, yet the efficacy of the piṇdas offered by the several sons was deemed to differ very much. Manu leaves no room for doubt on this point when he says (IX, 161 ) 'a man desiring to cross beyond the gloom (of bad worlds, helle) through (or with the help of) bad sons (such as the kṣetraja ) secures a result similar to what a person crossing (a sheet of ) water in a leaking boat secures'. The idea is that secondary sons cannot confer the same spiritual benefit as the aurasa son can. Modliātithi on Manu IX. 166 and the D. M. explain this very clearly. An aurasa son confers the highest spiritual benefit. The substitute sons (as indicated by the very use of the word Pratinidhi) confer a much less henefit. Even i man's widow can perform his sraddha if he be sonless, but as she could not offer the pārvuna śrūddha her act was not deemed to be as efficacious is a śrāddha performed by a son, 1239 Jaimini devotes several sūtras to the subject of pratinidhi (a substitute in VI. 3. 13-41. The main conclusion established is that gene rally speaking there can be no substitute as regards the devatā (the deity to which a particular offering is directed by the Veda to be offered in a particular sacrifice ), the fire (ahavaniya and other consecrated fires), the mantra ( wbich is to accompany a particular offering) and certain rites specifically prescribed to be done in a sacrifice (such as 'samidho yajati' in Darsa pūrnamāsa ) and the svāmin (the sacrificer ).

Rules about a protinilhi 

3.35 Sabara makes 120 it clear that in employing a pratinidhi the yedio rite becomes deficient' and does not yield the full reward of the religious act. The Satyāṣādha Śr. S. III. 1. asserts 1341 that there can be no substitute for the sacrificer, the wife, the son, the place, time &c. (prescribed by the Vedic texts for any rite). Therefore it is clear that there was difference of view among very ancient writers about the spiritual benefit to be derived from substitute sons. The natural human tendency to simplify matters and water down strict injunctions prevailed and it began to be thought that even subsidiary sons conferred gome spiritual benefit (though not as much as the aurasa son ). For about two thousand years the kṣetraja and other sons have been prohibited by the smrtis. For example, Br. states that Manu first describes the procedure of niyoga and then forbids it, that it is impossible to practise niyoga in the dvāpara and kali ages owing to the deterioration in man's knowledge and tapas ( vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 603 n. 1418 for the quotation). The passage from Saunaka forbidding sons other than aurasa and dattaka in the Kali age quoted by Aparārka and others has been cited above ( n, 1131 ). 

A few remarks will be made on each of the several sons. 

Aurasa. Baud. Dh, S, II. 2. 14, Manu IX. 166, Vas. 17. 13. Viṣnu Dh. S. 15. 2, Kaut.

( quoted above in n. 1227 ) and Baud, it follows that the aurasa is only the son procreated on a wife of the same varna as that of the husband; but this was the purists' view. Others including

such medieval works as the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 133 ), the Parijata and Apararka hold that even the son procreated on a wife married in the anuloma order 1242 (e. g. the son of a brābmana from a ksatriya wife or of a ksatriya from a vaisya caste wife ) was also aurasa. The exception was the son of a brāhinana from a śūdra wife, who was called saudra or pāratava and distinguished from the technical aurasa. Froni the definition of aurasa given by all smrti writers (and the dicta of such commentaries as the Mit.) it follows that in order to be an aurasa the procreation and the birth of the son must both be after the marriage. But the Privy Council held long ago in Pedda Amani v Zemindar of Marungpuri (1 I. A. 282, 293 ) that procreation after marriage is not distinctly necessary for legitimacy as a son even according to the ancient texts, that to hold 80 would be an inconvenient doctrine and that the Hindu Law is the same in that respect as the English Law. 1943 

From the times of the Rgveda people prayed for the birth of an aurasa son and did not like to adopt the son of another. A Rgvedio poet exclaims ( VII. 4. 7-8) 'As the wealth ( son )

The position of the Mit. is somewhat remarkable. The Mit, admits that niyoga is not allowed in the present Kali age (vide above p. 628 ) and it quotes a smrti text to that effect, but it allows the sons of anuloma marriages to be aurasa and to succeed before every other kinds of sons. Therefore it follows that the Mit. either did not know the passages of Saunaka and of the Nāradyiapurāna ( purvārdha 24. 13 ) which forbade marriage with asavarna girls for the twice-born classes in the Kali age or did not hold them to be authoritative.

1243. As this is a decision of the highest tribunal for British India it must be taken to be the law. The Privy Council was probably influenced by the description of such secondary sons as the saborha. The decision is in accordance with English Law and section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act.

Then he goes back to the same house (from which he came ); may & vigorous, victorious, newly born son come to us! "1244 

In modern times the courts generally recognize only two kinds of sons, viz. aurusa and datlaka, the other kinds of song being held to be long since obsolete. Vide Naginnas v. Bachoo 43 I. A. 56, 67. But two more kinds of sons have been recognized in modern times in certain provinces only, viz. the kṛtrima in Mithila (modern Tirhoot ) and the putrikāputra among the Nambudri brāhmaṇas of Malabar, both of which will be dealt with below. 

• Putrikāputra. The two meanings of this word given by the Mit. and others relying on Vas. have been stated above (p. 647 ): Kaut. III. 7, Yaj. II. 128, Manu IX. 134 declare the putrika or putrikāputra to be equal to the aurasa son. The conception underlying the putrikā has a hoary antiquity. There are traces of the putrika. in the Rgveda itself. Vas.124s XVII. 16 refers to 

1244. परिषरणस्प रेक्णो नित्पत्य रायः पतयः स्यामान शेषो अमे अन्यजात. मस्यचेतानस्य मा पथो विक्षः। न हि प्रभायारणा सुशेषोऽग्योदयों मनसा मन्तवा उ अधा चिदोकः पुनरिस एत्या मोवाज्यभाषाळेतु नग्यः R. VII, 4. 7-8. The verses are rather obscure, particularly the first one. The meaning given above is that of such an ancient writer as Yaska in Nir. III. 1-3. He says that these two verses support the view that the son belongs to the begetter (and not to the adopter): 'तयथा जनयितः प्रजा एवमर्थीये चावुवाहरिष्यामः । परिषचं.' Compare आप. ध.. II. 6. 13. 3 'उत्पादयितुः पुत्र इति हि बाहरणम् ।. The निर्णय सिन्धु says that the verse (न हि प्रभाय) does not really mean to prohibit the adoption of sons but is intended to extol the aurasa, as otherwise it would be opposed to the indications contained in the story of the acceptance of Sapagsepa as a son and to the words of the latter'may I become your son', योपिन हि प्रभाया ... मन्तवा उ इति श्रुतौ दत्तकनिषेधः सोप्यौरसातिशयार्थः, अन्यथा शुनाशेपादिमतिग्रहोलिकाविरोधापत्तेः । उपेयो तव पुत्रतामित्युक्तः । नि. सि.

Rg. I 124.7 in connection with putrikāi: That verse contains four similes in degoribing the advent of. Uṣas ( Dawn)'As a woman that has no brother comes back to (her) male relations,... like a smiling damsel the Dawn unnasks objects (or her beauty). The Nirukta ( IIL 5 ) explains the first quarter as meaning that a brotherlegs maiden (after marriage ) comes back to ber paternal line for continuing that line and for offering pindas (to her paternal ancestors ) and does not go to her husband's Hne. The Rg. in several places refers to the difficulty of getting brotherless maidens married and to the fact of their remaining in their father's hous3 as old maidans; vida Rp. II. 17, m'amūjūr. iur pitroh szcū sui' and IV. 5. 5. The Atharvaveda I. 17.1 states like brotherless sisters let these stand still with their splendours gone'. Yaska explains that, as brotherless maidens, when married, bar the way to the continuance of the family of their husbands and to offering of pindas (through their son), 80 are these red arteries &c. Vāska (Nirukta III. 4 ) relies for the appointment of a brotherless daughter as a son upon another very obscure verse of the Rg. (III. 31. 1 ) 1216 'the husband declares (or promises ) that the father may regard (the daughter's son) as his gon's son'. The Nirukta 1217 (III. 5) quotes a Vedic text one should not marry a brotherless (girl), for she becomes (her father's ) bon' and holds that it expressly prohibits marriage with a brotherless maiden and also declares that such a girl becomes a son to her father. The brotherless maiden is appointed as a son by express agreement, but accord. ing to Gautama 28. 17 the opinion of one school ( which he does not approve ) was that a brotherless girl became a putrika by the mere unilateral Intention of the father and therefore one should not marry a brotherless maiden for fear that the father (without expressly stipulating so) might intend her to be putrika. Manu III. 11 contains a similar caution. This re coinmendation not to marry a brotherless maiden continued down to the days of Yaj. (I. 53 'arogipim bhrātsmatim'), though in modern times many would prefer to marry such a girl, provided the father was well-off. Manu IX. 140 states that the

three piṇas that the putrikāputra offered were respectively to his mother, to the mother's father and to the mother's paternal grand-father. 

The putrikāputra is no longer recognised anywhere in India except among the Namhudri brābmaṇas of Malabar. Vide Thakoor Jeebnath v. Court of Wards 2 1. A. 163, 167, Babui Rila v. Babu Puran 1 Pat. L. J. 581, Kimaran v. Narayanan 9 Mad. 260, Chemnauth v. Palakuzhu 25 Mad. 662, 31 Mad.' 310. It appears that even a Madras authority like the Smrticandrikā 1248 was not aware of the prevalence of the putrikāputra in Malabar. 

Kṣetraja. This kind of son arosa from the practice of niyoga. The origin of this practice and the limitations under which it was allowed have been dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 599-607. One matter not mentioned therein is this that the Brahmapurāṇa states that kṣetraja sons were very conimon among ksatriyas since they had no progeny either because they were cursed (by sages for their misdeeds ) or because they were constantly engaged in war. 1219 The Baud. Da. S. 11. 2. 21-23 and Kauṭ. III. 7 declare the kṣetraja to be the son of two fathers, to have two gotras and to offer pindas to both fathers (provided there is no aurasa son born subse quently ) and to take their wealth and that in offering each pinda they have to associate it with two names. 1250 It is to be noted that the Mit. on Yaj. II. 127 introduoes the kṣetraja as dvyamuṣyāyapa, although that word, as will be seen later on, has another signisicance algo. The Madanapārijata (p. 651) also regards kṣetraja and dyyāmuṣyāyaṇa as synonyms. The Vivadata.dava ( folio 122 ) states that the dvyāmuṣyayapa and sons of intercaste marriages being forbidden in Kali it does not onter into any discussion about the rules of allotting shares to theni.

Kṛtrima or kyta, as in Nār, dayabhāga 46). According to Manu IX, 169, Yaj. II. 131, Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 25 and the Mit, and other works a kṛtrima is a person (of the same caste as the adopter) who has no parents and who is adopted with his own consent by the tempting offer of wealth. He is distinguished from the dattaka by the fact that he is not given by the father or mother and by the fact that his own consent is necessary ( 80 that he must be major according to the ancient Hindu Law). Such a son is recognized in modern times only in Mithila ( Tirhoot ) and the adjoining districts and among the Nambudri brahmaṇas of Malabar (as held in Vasudevan v. Secretary of State 11 Mad. 157). Considerable case law exists about the kstrima adoption, for which Mulla's Hindu Law pp. 563-564 ( 9th ed.) and Mayne's Hindu law (10th ed.) pp. 293-294 may be consulted. 

Gudhaja. There is probably a reference to such a son in the Rg. II. 29. 1 1251 '01 Adityas, that uphold the moral law, that are always active, keep away from me sin as a woman giving birth to a child in secret (removes it)'. 

Kanina. This word is derived from the word 'kanya' (a maiden). Papini IV. 1. 116 (kanyāyāh kanina ca) derives the word in the sense of "child of a maiden" and the Kāsikā gives Karpa and Vyāsa as instances of kinina sons. The word kanina occurs in the Atharvaveda V. 5.8 and Kumāripura occurs in the Vājasaneyasamhita 30. 6. Nār. ( dāyabhāga 17 ) 1252 says that the kanina, sahodha and gūdhaja are the sons of the man who marries the mother of these and they take the wealth of the husband of their mother. The Pārijāta ( 9. by V. R. P. 565) states that the kanina and sahodha become the sons of their mother's father if the latter is sonless, but if he has a son thon they become the sons of the husband of their mother and if both have no sons then they become the sons of both.

CHAPTER XXVIII 

DATTAKA ( adopted son) 

No branch of Hindu Law in modern times has been 80 fruitful in litigation' as adoption. There are instances, where, fifty years after a point in the law of adoption was deemed to have been settled by a Full Bench decision, the Privy Council intervened and overruled the Full Bench decision in spite of its usual practice to follow the rule of stare decisis. The medieval digests are full of varying interpretations of the same smrti toxts and the law of adoption differs from province to province according to the authoritative medieval works and modern case law. Voluminous works like those of Shastri Golapchandra Sarkar and of Mr. Kapur have been written on the subject of adoption in all its details. There is so much bewildering confusion and so much case law on the several aspects of adoption that it is only legislation that can resolve the tangled skein of the modern law of adoption. In this section an attempt will be made to present the law of adoption as evolved by the smrtis and medieval works and only some im portant cases bearing in various ways on the ancient law will be cited. 

It has been shown above (pp. 641,657) bow even in the times of the Rgveda the son of the body was eagerly sought for and how the adoption of another man's son was declared to be nut worthy of being thought of. Even so late an author as Sukra (11. 31 ) says that the adopted and other secondary sons should never be thought as one's sons, since on seeing a rich man they desire to be adopted 1252a. Yet Vedic Literature contains some references to adopted sons. In the Tai. S. VII. 1. 8. 1 we come across the the story of Atri, 12526 who gave an only son in adoption to Aurva in these words: 'Atri gave his son in adoption to Aurva

Ancient texts on adoption 

663 who desired to have a son. He (Atri), having become empty (as it were, by giving away his oply. son), thought himself to be destitute of strength, to be weak and worn out (lit. stale ). He (Atri) saw this catūrātra (a sacrifice of that same lasting for four days). He made preparations for it and performed that sacrifice. Then he had four valiant sons born to him, a good Hots, & good Udgats, a good Adhvaryu and a good sabheya (skilful speaker in an assembly). The story of Sunabśepa in the Ait. Br. (33) shows that Viśvāmitra, though he had already one hundred and one 'Bons, adopted Sunaksepa under the name Davarata, with the consent of his fifty-one sons (with Madhu cchandas 1253 at their head), though the elder 50 sons disobeyed their father. It must be supposed that the later rule allowing only a sonless man to adopt did not apply to Viśvāmitra. 

The sūtras and smstis contain hardly anything about the dattaka except his name (among the 12 kinds of sons) or the definition, as in Baud, Dh. S. II. 2. 24, Manu IX. 168, Yāj. II. 130, Viṣnu Dh. S 15. 18-19, Nār. (dāyabhaga 46). The Vas. Dh. 8. is an excoption. It not only gives a definition (in 17. 28-29), but is one of the earliest smrti texts to dilate on the rules about adoption (in 15.1-9). What it says may ba sat for th in one place. "Man produced from seed and blood owes his birth to his mother and father. (Hence) the mother and father have power to give, to sell or to abandon him. But one should not give or accept an only son, for, he is required to continue the line of his ancestors. A woman should neither give nor receive a son (in adoption) except with the permission of her husband. One about to take a son in adoption should, after having inyl ted his kinsaien, having informed the ruler (of the intended adoption) and having performed in the middle part of his house a homa with the výāhstis, take only him who is closely related and who is a kinsman not remote (in habitation and speech ). If a doubt ariges ( as to the family of the person to be adopted) he (the person desiring to adopt) should treat one whose kinsmen are in a remote place as if he were a sūdra; for it is declared (in the Brakmana or Vedio works) by means of one. (son, auraga or adopted) he (the adopter) saves many'. If, after a son is taken (in adoption ), an aurasa is born (to the adopter)the adopted son shall be the recipient of a fourth

M. and V. Mayūkha are those of Atri, Saunaka, 125$ Sakala and the Kalikāpurāpa. The Mit. does not contain more than a few lines on the dattaka. It is only in such late works (belonging to the 17th century and later tiines) like the V, Mayūkba, the Dattakamimamsā, the Samskara-kaustubha, the Dattakacandrika, that the dattaka receives an elaborate treat ment. In modern times the D. M. and D. C. ( which is branded as a forgery by some Bengal writers ) 1236 have been regarded by

It may, however, be noted that in Bhagwan v. Bhagwan 17 All. 294, 313 Mr. Jastice Banorji refused to place any reliance on the tradition.

the Privy Council as of the highest authority in matters of adoption. In Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Moo. I. A. 397 at p. 437 the P. C. obserye: 'Of the Dattakamsmāmsā of Nanda Pandita and the Dattaka. Candrikā of Devanna Bhatta, two treatises on the particular subject of adoption, Sir William Macnaghton says that they are respected all over India; but that when they differ the doctrine of the latter is adhered to in Bengal and by the southern Jurists, while the former is said to be the infallible guide in the provinces of Mithila and Benares'. But Jolly (T. L. L. p. 166) gives a far more correct estimate of the value of the D. M. when he says 'It is simply a mis fortune that so much authority should have been attributed in the courts all over India to such a treatise as Nanda Pandita's Mimāṁsā which abounds more in fanciful distinctions than perhaps any other work on adoption and it is high time that the numerous other treatises on adoption should be thoroughly examined and given their due weight. In Bhagwan v. Bhagwan 26 I A. 153 at p. 161 the P. C. observe 'To call it (the Dattaka mimāṁga ) infallible is too strong an expression and the esti mates of Sutherland and of West and Bühler seem nearer the true mark; but it is clear that both works must be accepted as bearing high authority for so long a time that they have be come embedded in the general law'. Yet even these works have been set at naught and departed from by Courts in India on many points as will appear in the sequel. 

The principal matters to be discussed under adoption are : object of adoption, persons that may legally take in adoption, persons that may give in adoption, persons that may be taken in adoption, the requisites and ceremonies of adoption and the results of adoption. 

The objects of adoption-Atri (verse 52 ) quoted above in note 1231 declares that that man alone who has no son should always secure a substitute for a son with all possible effort for the sake of securing the offering of pindas (funeral and śrāddha cakes) and water. The D. C. quotes this verse and also an other ascribed by it to Manu 1257 in which the object of adoption is said to be twofold, viz. securing spiritual benefit from the piṇdas and water ( offered by him ) and perpetuating the name and family of the adopter. In one of the latest cases on adop.

tion that revolutionized the law the Privy Council 1258 emphasize the peculiar religious significance that has attached to the son among all classes of Hindus, refer to the 9th chapter of Manu verses 106, 107, 137, 138 of which are instinct with this doctrine, hold that the foundation of the Brabminical doctrine of adop tion is the duty which every Hindu owes to his ancestors to provide for the continuance of the line and the solemnization of the necessary rites and that in this doctrine the devolution of property, though recognized as the inherent right of the son, is altogether a secondary consideration. 

Persons who can gine in adoption--The primary right to give in adoption is that of the father, who can do so without consult ing the mother, 1259 The mother cannot without the husband's permission give her son in adoption while the father is alive and capable of consenting. But the mother alone can (as said by Manu IX. 168, Yaj. II. 130 ) give her son in adoption if the father be dead or if he is incapable of giving consent or has entered the order of ascetics, provided he has not expressly or impliedly prohibited her to do 80. If both parents are dead no one else, not even the paternal grand-father or the step-mother or a brother, can give a man in adoption. If A has a son B and is then given in adoption by his mother into another family, it was held in Martand v. Narayan that A still retained his power as father to give away B in adoption (1. L. R. 1939 Bom, 586 F.B.). This decision has been dissented from by the Nagpur High Court in Sharadachandra v. Shantabai (I. L. R. 1944 Nag. p. 544, F. B.). But the reasons given by the Nagpur High Court are not convincing and the judges seem to be influenced by the dictum of the P. O. that the adopted son is 

1258. Vide Amarendra Man Singh v. Sanatan 60 I. A. p. 242. Though it may be conceded that in the majority of cases the object of the adopter is religious, the object of the giver and of the person adopted (if he is grown up) is far from religious. The main object of the latter two at least in modern times is to secure wealth without effort and hardly any reli. gious motives enter into their minds. No ono gives a son in adoption to a poor man, though a poor man has a soul to save as much as a rich man. Besides in adoption by widows, their motive is very often far from religious. They often adopt out of pique against their husband's brothers or nephews Bad for benefiting themselves monetarily by making agreements with the adopted sons to share the property with them.

Who may adopt a son

just like an aurasa son except in a few well defined cases. It cannot be supposed that the P. O. know all the texts of the nibandhas dealing with adoption. Though the Bombay High Court held in Putalabai v. Mahadu 33 Bom. 107 that a mother did not by her remarriage forfeit her right to give in adoption her son by the first husband, that decision was subsequently overruled in Fakirappa v. Savitreua 23 Bom, L. R. 482 (F. B.) which decided that after remarriage a widow has no power to give in adoption her son by the first husband. The same High Court held in Shamsing v. Shantabai (25 Bom. 551) that a Hindu father, who, after the birth of a bon, became a convert to the Moslem faith, did not by reason of his conversion lose his power of giving his son, who remained a Hindu, in adoption though the physical act of giving in adoption, being accom panied by religious ceremonies, may have to be delegated by him to a Hindu. This decision was based on the Caste Dis abilities Removal Act of 1851 (for which see above p. 547, no 1021 ). This decision is against the spirit of the ancient Hindu Law. 

What persons may adopt a son. Every male Hindu, who is of sound mind and has attained the age of discretion though he may be a minor according to the Indian Majority Act (III of 1875), can take a son in adoption provided he has no son, grandson or great-grandson, natural or adopted, living at the time of adoption. The word 'aputrena' in the verse of Atri ( quoted above in n. 1231) is explained by the D. M. as meaning 1260 one who had no son at all or whose son is dead and as in cluding the grandson and great-grandson. It would appear from a Bombay decision that even if a Hindu has a son, grand son or great-grandson disqualified from inheriting on the grounds mentioned above he cannot adopt (vide Bharmappa v. Ujjangauda 46 Bom. 455). In the Dattasiddhantamañjarl of Balakrspa (folio 11b) it is stated that if the aurasa son of a person is congenitally blind, dumb or deaf he can take a boy in adoption. In Krishnaji v. Raghavendra I. L. R. (1942) Bom. 492 it has been held, relying upon 46 Bom, 455, that a widow

cannot adopt a son during the lifetime of her natural son who was a congenital idiot. The fact that a man is a bachelor or a widower or that his wife does not consent or that she is preg nant at the time of adoption does not prevent him from taking a son in adoption. In fact Vasiṣtha provides for the birth of a son after a son is adopted (15. 9). It was said 1261 by Rudra. dhara aud Vacaspati that as gūdras cannot perform homa with vedic mantras ( required by Vas. quoted above on p. 663) sūdras cannot adopt a son. Others like Raghunandana, Nilakantha, D.M. hold that a gūdra can adopt, as Saunaka expressly allows him to do so and that the homa may be performed through & brāh maṇa (as allowed by Parāśara VI. 63-64) 1262. A wife cannot adopt during her husband's lifetime except with his express congent (as Vas. 15. 5 says). 

After a man's death the only person that can adopt to him is his widow. It is as regards the power of the widow that the greatest divergence of views prevails. The basic text is that of Vas. 15. 5 (a woman should not give or take in adoption except with the absent of her husband). The resourcefulness and ingenuity of commentators, all deemed to be orthodox and all proficient in the Mimāṁsā rules of interpretation, is illustrated nowhere better than in the interpretations of this text. Four interpretations are placed on this sūtra of Vasiṣtha: (1) The D. M. and writers of Mithilā such as Vācaspati hold that a widow cannot adopt at all, because at the time of adoption it is im possible to have the consent of the husband (who is then dead) and because a woman cannot perform the homa with vedic mantras and cannot repeat the vedic passages about acceptance (which are required by Vasistha and Saunaka); (2) In Bengal, Madras and Benares it is held that a widow may adopt under an authority from her husband given during his lifetime.

idea is that the permission (anujñāna) of the husband is not required to be given just at the time of the adoption and that it may be given long before the actual adoption. (3) In Madras a widow may also adopt without 1263 her husband's authority, provided she secures the consent of the father-in-law or (if the latter be dead) of all the co-parceners of the husband, if her husband died as a member of a joint family, and if the husband was separate at the time of his death, then the consent of the father-in-law or (if he were dead) of a substantial majo rity of her husband's nearest sapindas. In this view the word 'of the husband' (in Vasistha) is taken as only illustrative and not literally, (4) The Vyayahāramayūkha, 1264 the Nirnaya sindhu, the Samskārakaustubha, the Dharmasindhu, that are regarded as authoritative in Bombay and Western India, hold that the passage of Vasistha refers only to a wife whose husband is alive and that a widow may adopt without the husband's autho rity. According to this school the husband's authority to adopt is always to be presumed, unless he has prohibited his widow expressly or by necessary implication from adopting. The D. C. appeals to the general maxim 'another's (or the opponent's) view if not dissented from may be taken as having been approved'. 

1263. In Balsubramanya v. M. Subbayya L. R 65 I. A. 93 at p. 99 the Privy Council say : 'their Lordships are not laying down that the requisite authority must necessarily be express but they agree with the District Judge that in order to constitute an implied authority there must be circumstantial evidence of a cogent character'. Vide The Collector of Madura v. Mootoo 12 Moo. I. A. 397 pp. 435-36 where three of these four interpretations are pointed out.

History of Dharmasastra 

(Voi. 

There is a large volume of case law about the construction of the authority to adopt, about the rights of co-widows in the matter of adoption, about the limits of a widow's power, which are deemed to be outside the purview of this work. 

As regards the power of a widow to adopt in the Bombay school, when her husband was joint at the time of his death, the case law has fluctuated from time to time. Only a few cases may be referred to here. In Ramji v. Ghamau 6 Bom, 498 (F. B.) a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court held tbat a widow, whose husband was a member of a joint family at the time of his death, could not adopt when she has not the authority of her husband or the consent of the husband's un divided coparceners. After this decision had stood for 50 years the Privy Council held in Bhimabai v. Gurunathgouda 1265 L. R. 60 I. A. P. 25 that the Full Bench decision had already been overruled in Yadao . Namdeo ( 48 I. A. 513) and that a Hindu widow can adopt without the consent of her husband's 

1265. IA Bbimabai's case the Privy Council purport to follow the case of Rakhmabai v, Radhabai 5 Bom. H. C. R. (A C. J.) p 181. But in that case the husband was separate at tbe time of his death. The P. C. however point out that in Yadao v, Namdeo (48 1. A. 513 at p. 529 ) it was said that the decision ia Rakhmabai's case was not based on the fact that the husband was separate at bis death or on the fact that the widow when she made the adoption bad the estate vested in her and it was beld tbat that decision was equally applicable wbere the husband was joint. Apart from the fact that the decision of the P. C. is opposed to the general sentiment of Hindu society at present, with the greatest respect two criticisms have to be offered against the decision in Bhimabai's case. The passage of the Vyavabāramayūkba relied upon in Rakhmabai's case and in Bbimabal's case has not been correctly understood, The Mayökha was combating the view of others that a widow cannot adopt at all. Therefore ho tried to establish that a widow can adopt without her husband's authority. But the Mayukha did not say expressly that she can adopt without any body's authority or that she can adopt even in a joint family without the consent of the coparceners or even against their wishes. On the contrary if we look at the whole context where he quotes Vāj. I. 85 and a verse of Kāt. (930) it would appear that he meant to convey that the consent of the father of the husband or of his kiasmen would be necessary. Further, no one drew the attention of the P. C. to another passage of the V, Mayūkba whore it summarizes the rite of adoption and states 'Women whose busbands are alive are entitled to adopt with the permission of their husbands: failing the husband, a woman can adopt with the permission of the (busband's) father and the rest: front FUIT HIHAT THE faming , HYU P. 120.

00-parooners, when the husband was a member of a joint family at the time of his death. This decision was carried further by Amarendra's case ( 60 L. A. 242 ) by holding that when a widow, who had authority to adopt, adopted even after the estate had devolved on a male collateral heir such adopted son would take the estate and deprive the heir of it. As any widow was held to be able to adopt in Bombay without anybody's consent, hundreds of adoptions have taken place, which came and are coming before the courts. Another Full Bench case held that when a Hindu coparconary came to an end on the death of the last surviving coparcener and the family property became Vested in his heir, a subsequent adoption by the widow of a predeceased coparcener was valid, but it did not revive the coparcenary nor did it vest the property of the former co parcenary in the adopted son (Balu v. Lahoo L L. R. 1937 Bom. 508). When a co-parcenary was broken up by partition among the members, it was held 1266 that the widow of a co parcener who died long before the partition cannot make a valid adoption and reliance was placed on a passage of the Viramitrodaya ( quoted below ). 1207 

But these decisions have been dissented from in Bajirao v. Ramkrishna I. L. R. (1941) Nagpur 707 and in K. R. Saṅkarlingam Pillai v. Veluchami Pillai I. L. R. (1943) Mad, 309 ( F. B.), where it has been laid down that when the surviving coparconers of a joint Hindu family were in possession of the joint family properties which they obtained in a partition among themselves after the death of a coparcener and subsequent to the partition a valid adoption was made to the deceased coparcener by his widow the adopted son was entitled to reopen the partition. They rely by way of analogy on the provisions of Yaj. that the posthumous son can reopen a partition already made and also on that of the disqualified heir when the disqualification is removed and on the dicta in some cases that an adoption dates back to the date of the death of the adoptive father, But no smrti text and no digest has extended the exceptional rules about the posthumous son and the disqualified heir to a son

adopted after partition. Their reasoning as regards the Bombay cases is not satisfaotory. It amounts to this that as between the separating co-paroeners the coparcenary may be extinct but as to the subsequently adopted son it exists i. e, a co parcenary is extinct and existing at the same time, which, to use no stronger expression, appears rather strange. Besides the general rule is that partition is made only once ( Manu 1X. 47). The cases of the posthumous son and of the disqualified heir are expressly provided by way of exceptions. The usual rule is that exceptions are to be strictly limited to the matters expressly stated and are not to be extended by analogy to cases not covered by the words of the exception and that other cases are governed by the general rule. It is a canon of interpreta tion in Hindu Law that a special text forming an exception to a general text should be construed strictly and applied only to the cases clearly falling within it ( Gangi v. Chandrabhagabai 32 Bom. 275, 283, Hanmant v. Ganesh 43 Bom. 612, 624). Further, a Hindu widow is not compelled to adopt at any particular time; she may adopt at any time during her life. In Raje Vyankatrao v. Jayavantrao 4 Bom. H. C. R. (A, C. J.) 191 it is noticed that the widow in that case adopted 71 years after her husband's death. If the reasoning of the learned Judges of Nagpur and Madras is correct then when three or four genera tions have succeeded to the separating coparceners, an adopted' son can reopen the partition after three quarters of a century This result, to say the least, would be most unreasonable. The Nagpur High Court observes that every Hindu widow is a potential mother. This is a fiction which has been oarried too far by that courtand by the Privy Council. A woman in the order of nature can hardly ever have an aurasa son beyond the age of fifty or so, but when a fiction is employed a woman can bring into existence & son even when she is 80 or 90. The Privy Council have approved of the Nagpur and Madras decisions recently in Anant v. Shankar 46 Bom. L. R. 1. They hold that a Hindu family cannot be brought to an end while it is possible in nature or law to add a male member to it or while there is still a potential mother if that mother in the way of nature or law brings in a new member. In Ramchandra v. Shankar 47 Bom. L. R. 121 (F. B.) the Privy Council decision in Anant v. Shankar has been followed and it is held that, the decision in Balu v. Lahod has been expressly overruled by the Privy Counoil. The consequences of these latest decisions will be inost disastrous for Hindus. In Amarondra's case the P, O. state that there

must be some limit to the power of a widow to adopt or some conditions in which it would be contrary to the spirit of the dootrine to admit its continuance or inequitable in the face of other rights to allow it to take effect (L. R. 60 I. A. 242 at p. 249 ). ' In Madana Mohana v. Purshothama L. R. 45 I. A. 156 the P. O. approving of Ramkrishna v. Shamrao - 26 Bom. 526 (F. B.) held that, when a man dies leaving a widow and a son and that son dies leaving his own son or a widow to continue the line by adoption, the power of the former widow comes to an end and cannot be revived; that is, they were prepared to hold that the grandmother succeed ing to her grandson who died unmarried could not make a valid adoption and allowed the grandfather and his ancestors to remain without the religious benefits that a son adopted by the grandmother would have conferred (in spite of the 9th chapter of Manu on which they rely in Amarendra's case ). According to the recent rulings any widow whose husband died a member of a joint Hindu family may adopt at any time oven when the other members become separate and may remain separate for 50 years or more and yet a large slice of the estate may be taken away after several generations have succeeded, laboured and acquired a vast estate. Further, it is not clear how far the P. O. will go in their solioitude for the adopted son. Suppose three brothers separate and one of them sells the pro perty that came to his share. If the partition is to be opened for the benefit of a son subsequently adopted by a predeceased member's widow, will the purchaser be affected or not (supposing the sale is within 12 years of the adoption)? Suppoging that the last surviving member of a fainily dies leaving a married daughter and a predeceased son's widow and the daughter inhe rits an absolute estate ( as she does in Bombay) and remains in possession for 30 years, is it meant that a son thereafter adopted by the widowed daughter-in-law can divest an estate Vested for thirty years in a married daughter who is not a mem ber of the family at all after her marriage? The recent P. C. decision in Anant v. Shankar appears to indicate that whatever the longth of time the adopted son will oust a collateral to whom the estate may have gone by inheritance. Intending purchasers have become afraid that there is no knowing how far the P. O. may go. These decisions will lead on to hurried sales of joint family proporty at whatever price may be fetched immodiately a coparcener dies leaving a widow. The result of the several decisions of the P. O. has been that properties of

Hindu families in which widows of predeceased coparceners exist are not easily saleable and do not yield their proper market value. The inroads on the ancient joint family system of the Mitakṣarā have been so many that only the shell remains; the burdeng are there, but the soul is gone, what with the right of each coparcener to alienate his share for consideration, the Gains of learning Act, Act 18 of 1937, the decisions of the P. C. about adoption, sec. 39 of the Transfer of Property Act. It would be better if the Legislature declared that the joint family system of the Mitakṣarā type has been abrogated, if all the inno vations introduced by legislation and judicial decisions are to be kept intact. 

A widow who has attained years of discretion may adopt although she is a minor according to the Indian Majority Act (of 1875). It has been held in Bengal that an unchaste 1368 widow cannot adopt, but in the Bombay Presidency it has been held that a sūdra widow, though unchasto, may make a valid adoption, 1369 If a man dies leaving a widow D and two sons A and B, who form a joint Hindu family, and subsequently A dies leaving a widow C and his brother B, and if B dies un married and the mother D suoceeds as heir to her unmarried Bon B, she has still the power to adopt a son. The duty of continuing the line was cast upon both A and B and not on A alone and therefore when A dies that duty is cast on the survi ving coparcener B. Therefore the proposition laid down in Ramkrishna v. Shamrao cannot apply and the mother of B can adopt ( vide Anant ». Dnyaneshwar 46 Bom. L. R. 353 ). 

Who may be adopted. The person to be adopted must be a malo according to the Vyavahāramayūkha1270 which relies on the analogy of upanayana ( that only a male undergoes, as stated in the ancient text 'aztavarpam brāhmanam-upanayita). This has been followed by

the Indian Courts. 171 But the D. M, (pp. 112-116 ), Sam. K. (p. 188 ) and Dharmasindhu 1972 relying upon such instances as that of Santa, the daughter of king Dasaratha ( who was adopted by king Lomapāda) and of Pșthā, who was the daughter of Sūra and was adopted by Kuntibhoja, say that even a girl may be adopted. Pannalal in ‘Kumaun local customs' states that a girl may be adopted as a daughter in Kumaun by custom. The person to be adopted must be of the same caste as the adopting father. Yaj. II. 133, providing that the twelve kinds of sons that offer the pinda and take the wealth one after another in order, applies only to sons of the same caste. Saunaka also requires sameness of caste. Manu IX. 168 employs the word 'sadrśam', which was interpreted by Medbā. tithi as meaning 'similar to the adopter in qualities and not in caste'. Medhātithi 1273 expressly states that a brahmana may adopt a kṣatriya boy. But Kullūka and the other con mentators of Manu, the V. Mayūkha and other works hold that the boy must be of the same caste. The Sam. K, p. 150 and Dharmasindhu go a step further by saying that even a brāhmaṇa should adopt another of the same country. The Vāyu purāṇa (99. 137–139) narrates that Bharata, son of Duṣyanta, adopted Bharadvāja, son of Bphaspati and a brahmana, who then became a kṣatriya. 1274 The courts accept the view of Kullūka and the rest. It is likely that courts may allow & boy from & subcaste of each of the four principal varpas to be adopted by a man belonging to another subcaste of the same varpa, 1274.

that the dattaka may be of a different caste, but that such a son will not take the wealth. 1275 In spite of the words of Vas. 15. 3 and of Saunaka ( that one having an only son should not give him ) the courts have hold that even an only son may be given or taken in adoption and that the words of Vasiṣtha are merely recominendatory.

I. .. 26-30) came in for very exhaustive discussion in Beni Prasad v. Hardai Bibi 14 All. 67 (F. B.) and Radha Mohun v. Hardai Bibi 26 I. A. pp. 113, 146. There are several Vedic passages like this,' he offers the grains into the fire with a windowing basket, for food is prepared with the help of it' (Tai. Br. I 6.5). The question is whether such sentences put forward a reason for what is enjoined in the preceding portion or whether they are intended merely as arthavādas (i. e. for the praise of what is stated in the preceding part of the passage ). Jaimini con cludes that they are for the purpose of praise 1277 alone.

Adoption of eldest son 

677 

"The eldest son also should not be taken in adoption, since, as the Mit. (on Yāj. IL 130) puts it, it is the eldest son alone who is the foremost in serving the purposes of a son as regards his genetive father aco, to Manu IX. 106 which says 'a man becomes one having & son (a father) by the mere faot of the birth of his ( fret) son and becomes free from the debt owed to 

(Continued from the last page) prepared) may equally be used instead of the sūrpa. But the object of the latter half is not to assign a reason, but rather to praise and recommend tho sūrpa as the means of making the homa and so nothing but the sūrpa can be employed in making the offering. The Veda is the final authority in all matters pertaining to sacrifice; it does not stand in need of giving reasons for its prescriptions but it may eulogise an act to induce people to perform it. Therefore in the hetuvan-nigadādbikarana Jaimini does not lay down (as thought by Mandlik and by the High Court in 14 All, 67, pp. 73, 84, 125) that when a text is supported by a clause containing words of reason, it should be regarded as merely recommendatory (and not obligatory), but what Jaimidi lays down is that clauses containing words generally meaning *reason' are to be construed as arthavadas (praises) of the obligatory rule contained in a previous clause. Mr. Mandlik says (p. 499 of bis . Hindu Law'). It is a rule of the Pūrvamimamsā that all texts supported by the Assigning of a reason are to be deemed not as vidhi but simply as arthavada (recommendatory). When a text is treated as an arthavāda it follows that it has no obligatory force whatever. Sabarasvamia constructs an adhi karaña on this head which he calls 'hetuman-nigadādhikarana' (quoted in 14 All. 67 at p. 73). This is entirely wrong as shown above and the adhi karana is not called 'hetuman etc.' but 'hetuvan etc.'. Acc. to Jaimini's rule the words of Vas. 15.3 'naikam putram' contain a vidbi (an obligatory rule), while the following clause containing the word 'hi' (indicative of a reason) 'sa hi santānāya pūrvesām'is merely an arthavada, which praises the vidbi by emphasizing the importance of a son. Sarkar in his 'Mimāmsā Rules' (pp. 175-176) correctly represents the meaning of Jaimini, though in somewhat obscure language, The decisions in 14 All. 67 and 26 I. A. 113 are correct so far as the Mit. and the Mayūkba are concerned, though the judgments in the former case are wrong in what is regarded to be the meaning of Jaimini's aphorisms constituting 'betuvan-pigadādhikarana'. The Privy Council in 26 I. A, 113 at p. 146 refer to the supposed rule of Jaimini that all precepta supported by the assignment of a reason are to be taken as recommendations only, but they express themselves guardedly and say that the rule is rather startling and they would not admit it to be true unless tbey made' an intimate study of the smṛtis. The commentaries will make the Pūrvamināmsā position clear.

the pitre'. But in modern times this rule is taken to be only roommendatory and the adoption of the eldest son is held valid as also that of an only son 1978. The V. Mayūkha (p. 108) states: 800, to the Mit. the prohibition to give the eldest son affects only the giver but not the adopter and he criticizes the Mit. that Manu LX. 106 does not forbid the giving of the eldest son, but only provides that by the birth of the first son a man becomes free from debt (to pitrs). So the V. Mayākha goes a step fur ther and holds that there is no prohibition at all either to give.. or take in adoption the eldest son, while the Mit., though it does not hold the adoption bad, seems to hold that the giver incurred blame. The Sam. K. p. 150 also does not allow the adoption of the eldest son. Two or more persons cannot adopt the same boy and if they do so the adoption by each is invalid 1779. The Dvyāmuṣyayaṇa adoption, to be described later on, is an exception. 

The texts contain rules about preference in selecting a boy for adoption, when several are eligible. The Mit, 1280 on Yaj. II. 132 declares that the verse of Manu IX, 182 stating that when out of several brothers who are sons of the same father one has a son all of them become through that son per sons having a son' does not provide that he becomes really the son of all but it indicates that when a brother's son is available

for adoption another boy should not be adopted. A similar explanation had been given by an ancient commentator Deva. svĀmin. The D. M., D. C. (pp. 5-6 ) and Sam. K. p. 150 quote passages of Saunaka 1981 and Sakala that a man should prefer a sapiṇda or a sagotra to one who is not a sapiṇda or of the same gotra. The D. M., D. C., the Sam. K. p. 150, the Dharma sindhu recommend the following order: the full brother's son, then a sagotra sapinda, then a sapinda though not of the same gotra (such as a boy from one's maternal uncle's line or a paternal aunt's descendant), then one not a sapiṇda though of the same gotra, then one who is neither a sapiṇda nor a sagotra. This order is purely recommendatory and an adoption in breach of it is quite valid. It has been recently held that an adoption is invalid if the boy adopted be congenitally and incurably deaf and dumb though not an idiot. Vide Surendra v. Bholanath I. L. R. (1944) 1 Ca). 139. 

As to the age of the boy to be adopted there is great diver gence among the medieval writers which is also reflected in the case law. In this connection certain verses of the Kālikāpuriṇa assume 1282 great importance. The V. Mayūkha and the D. C.

hold that the passage is of doubtful authenticity (as the verses are not found in several mss.), while the D. M. and the Nirnaya sindhu hold them to be genuine and the Sam. K. pp. ( 169-172) after referring to these views states that those verses are opposed to what is stated in the Ait. Br. about Sunaḥsepa who was adopted by Visvāmitra as a son even after upanayana. The Verges are: 'O King1 that son, whose samskāras up to (including) the cuda (tonsure ) ceremony are performed with the gotra of his (natural) father, does not (i. e, cannot) attain the status of the adopted son of another. When the ceremonies of cūda and upanayana are performed under his own gotra (by the adoptive father) the dattaka and the other kinds become (recognised as) sons (in the adoptive family); otherwise they are called dāsa (slave). After the fifth year the adopted son and the rest can not be (recognised as) sons. Having taken one who is five years old, one ( the adopter ) should first perform the putreṣti'. These verges state four propositions: (1) If all samskāras from jātakarma to cūda (ie, including it) have been performed in the family of birth that boy cannot be adopted in another family; (2) if a boy's cūdā and other later ceremonies are per formed in the family of adoption he is fully an adopted son; (3) a boy over five years of age cannot be adopted at all; (4) a boy whose cūda has been performed in the family of birth may be adopted up to five years, provided the rite called putreṣti 1283 is first performed in the adoptive family before any other cere. mony is performed on the adopted boy. The D. M. says that the best time for adoption is up to three years, then from three years to five is the next best (gauna) and that after five no boy can be adopted. The D. O. (p. 36 ) holds that a boy of the three higher classes can be adopted up to upanayana and that a śūdra boy can be adopted till his marriage. The Nirnaya sindhu seems to be of the same opinion. The V. Mayūkha 1294

and Sam. K. both hold that even a boy not of the same gotra may be taken in adoption after upanayana or after marriage and even when the person to be adopted has himself had a son. In Bengal, Benares 1285. and Bihar the courts hold that the boy must be adopted before upanayana. The same rule holds good in Madras 1286 ; but there it is further held that if the boy to be adopted is of the same gotra as the adopter, the adoption may be made after upanayana but before marriage. In Bombay a person may be adopted at any age, even after marriage and even after he has had children and he may be even older than the adopter. 1387 In the whole of India, a śūdra may be adopted only before his marriage, but in the Bombay Presidency the adoption of a married man and of one having even a child is allowed also among gūdras 1288

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. Saunaka required that the boy to be adopted must be pritracchayavaha 1289 (one who bears resemblance to or is a reflec tion of the aurasa son). This has led to differing explanations by the commentators and contradictory decisions in the several Indian High Courts. The D. M. and D. C. (p. 21 ) both explain that the resemblance consists in the possibility of being pro created by the adopter himself by niyoga and the like. The meaning of the D. M. is: A brother's son or a sapinda's son or a sagotra's son can be adopted because the adopter could have procreated a son by the practice of niyoga on the wife of a brother or a sapiṇda or a sagotra (according to the rules of niyoga); but he could not have done so as regards his mother, or grandmother, daughter or sister or his mother's sister. There fore a man cannot adopt his own brother, paternal or maternal uncle, a daughter's son or a sister's son and the like. One strange thing is that, though niyoga had been forbidden for many centuries before the D. M., the author of it brings in the rules of the long obsoleto practice of niyoga 1290 to find out who could or could not be adopted. But stranger things were to happen. Sutherland who translated both the D.M. and the D. C. explained in his notes the word ' niyogādina' as ' by such an appointment or marriage and the like'. Vide Stoke's Hindu Law Texts p. 590 ( Dattakamlmāṁsa, sec. V, placitum 16 note). There was no warrant for introducing the word ' marriage' after 'niyoga'. The rules of niyoga are different from those of marriage. The judges most of whom were generally ignorant of Sanskrit and had yet to decide cases among Hindus according to Hindu Law as understood by them ( vide 26 I. A. 113 at page 128 about the ignorance of Sanskrit among judges ) seized upon this explana tion and evolved the curious rule that no one could be adopted whose mother the adopter could not have married in her maiden state (i. e. the relationship has reference to a time prior to

marriage ). This is still the law in all Presidencies 1291 except Bombay. Although the D. M. stated that the boy to be adopted must be capable of being prooreated by niyoga, at another place it remarks, after quoting verses of Saunaka 1992 and Sakala, that a boy of another gotra may be adopted except a daughter's son, a sister's son and a mother's sister's son. The Bombay High Court holds that any one may be adopted except these three (vide Rantchandra v. Gopal 32 Bom. 619, Walbai v. Heerbai 34 Bom. 491 holding that a man cannot adopt his mother's sister's son, Ramkrishna v. Chimnaji 15 Bom. L. R. 824 holding the adoption of father's sister's son valid). Very strange results have followed from this viz. the Bombay High Court has upheld the validity of the adoption as a son by a man of his own half-brother ( vide Gajanan v. Kashinath 39 Bom. 410), of his own maternal uncle's son, and the adoption by a widow of her deceased husband's son-in-law ( vide Sitabai v. Parvatibai 47 Bom. 35 ). It should be noted that the Dvaitanirnaya or Dharmadvaitanir naya 1293 (of Saṅkarabhatta, father of Nilakantha) and the V. Mayūkha both hold after a very abstruse reasoning based on several Mimāmsā rules, that men of the three higher classes may

adopt a daughter's son, a sisters's son or a mother's sister's son and that a sūdra must adopt one of these if available in preference to any one else. The Bombay High Court follows the inter pretation of Saunaka's verse given by Nandapandita in preference to Nilakantha's, but in its turn disregards the authority of Nandapaṇdita who forbade the adoption of a brother or uncle. It would have been far better if it had generally brushed aside everywhere the dicta of Nanda pandita and preferred the interpretation of the Mayūkha. Popular sentiment is in favour of the daughter's son or sister's son being adopted, as they are the nearest and often the dearest relations, and yet the High Court shuts the door against them, while it opens it ajar for the adoption of a brother or maternal uncle or his son or one's own daughter's. husband, which appears absurd to people. Besides the High Courts have recognised the adoption even of a daughter's son 1294 on the ground of custom by Daśastha smārta brāhmapas in the Dharwar District (vide Sundrabai v. Harmant 56 Bom. 298 ), by Telugu brāhmaṇas ( Viswasundara v. Somasundara 43 Mad. 876). Sūdras can adopt a daughter's or sister's or mother's sister's son all over India. The D, M. went so far as to say that a widow could not adopt her brother's son. 1295 The D. M. ignored the fact that the widow adopts to her husband ( and not to herself) who bore no relation to his wife's brother's wife and who could have himself adopted that son. The Bombay High Court and the Privy Council have discarded this absurd proposition of the D. M. Pannalal in 'Kumaun Local customs'

Dvyamu syāyana adoption

notes that in that part of India a daughter's or a sister's son may be adopted (p. 14 para 56). It has been recently held that the adoption of the illegitimate son of a woman even among śūdras is invalid. Vide Apya v. Ramakka I. L, R. (1941) Bom. 350. This was relied upon for holding that a woman cannot give in adoption an illegitimate son among Lingayats in Tirkangauda v. Shivappa A, I. R. (1944) Bom. 40. 

It is now necessary to pay a few words about the dvyāmu syāyana. A datlakı is of two kinds 1296, kevala (simple or ordinary ) and dvyūmuṣyāyana ( the son of two fathers). When a man gives his only son in adoption to another under an agree ment that he is to be considered as the son of both the natural father (janaka or janaka-pitr) and of the adoptive father (pālaka ), the son so given is called duyāmu syāyana. The Bombay High Court has held that in order to constitute a dvyāmu syāyana an express agreement as stated above must be proved even when one brother adopts the only son of another 1297 A dvyāmusyāyaṇa inherits both in the natural and adoptive families. The word dvyamuṣyāyaṇa was employed in some of

It has already been seen (p. 659 ) that the Mit. employs the words dvyamusyāyana and kṣetraja as synonyms, Nār, (dayabhāga 23) appears to use it in the same sense, *शिरामुण्यापणा वहाम्या पिण्डोदके पूधक। रिक्थादध समादीजिक्षेत्रिकयोस्तथा ॥. In this verse Nār. does not employ the form dvyāmuṇyāyana, but the word āmuzyāyaṇa with the adverb 'dvih meaning 'twice'. The word dvyāmuṣyāyana is made up of dvi' (two) and 'amusyāyana.

ths smrtis as applicable to all such sons as the dattaka,kritains, The V. Mayukha quotes a prose passage from Katyayana (which is attributed to Paithinasi in D. C.) and the V. Mayakha, D. M. and D. C. all quote a verse (which is ascribed to Pravarādhyāya by the first and to Parijāta by the D. M.) that supports this. The D. M. and D. C. both quote two gūtras of Satyaṣadha and Sabara's gloss (bhāṣya) thereon in which the kṣetroja is called nitya dvyāmuṣyāyana and the dattaka and others are called anitya dvyāmuṣyayapa. Yaj. II. 127 and Baud. Dh. S. II. %. 21 provide that a kṣetraja is the son of both the begetter and of the husband of the wife on whom the son is procreated. Therefore such a son is called nitya dvyāmusyāyana (because he is always the son of two fathers ), When the kṣetraja became obsolete and forbidden, the only dvyāmusyāyaṇa was an only son taken in adoption with a stipulation as described above. About the dattaka Maru IX. 142 states the general rule that the dattaka loses the gotra of his genetive father and assumes that of the adopter. But a dattaka belonged to two gotras according to some, if bis samskāras up to caula were performed in his natural family and the samskāra of upanayana and those that follow were performed in the adoptive family. Therefore it was not a general proposition that a dattaka always belonged to two gotras. If all the samakāras from jātakarma were performed by the adopter, then the dattaka would take the gotra of the adopter alone, Hence the sons called dattaka and 'the bought' were styled anitya dyyamusyayapas ( who were not in all cases dvyamusyāyanas). The D. M. states this 1299 twofold division of dvyāmuṣyāyanas and employs the words nityavat or nitya and anityavut or anitya

The kṣetraja became quite obsoleto many oenturies ago and the courts have held that the anitya dvyāmusyayapa is also now obsolete. 1300. It is now held that every adoption is presumed to be in the simple ( kevala) form, unless a stipulation that the boy will be the Bon of both is proved ( when it will be a dvyāmuṣyāyana adoption). 

When a man is adopted in the dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa form, his son born after such adoption has been held to inherit as grand son to the adoptive father, if the dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa son died before the adoptive father. 1300a 

Ceremonies of Adoption. The most essential ingredient in adoption is the giving of the boy by the natural father and the taking of the boy by the adopter with the intention to transfer the boy to the family of the adopter. Another requisite (in some cases ) is the homa called dattahonu 1301 which as described by Saunaka and Baud, is given 1302 in the Appendix. It is not necessary that the daltahoma must be performed immediately after the giving and taking, but it may be performed later and its performance may be delegated to others when the giver or taker is a widow or a sūdra or is ill &o. Although in Vedic times women composed hymns and although Hārita and Yama stated that women had the upanayana performed on them and could study the Veda (H. Db. vol. II pp. 293-295), in later times it was held that women could not study the Veda, could not repeat Vedic mantras and therefore could not perform any homa (including dattahoma). Therefore some writers said that a widow could not adopt at all, while others like the V. Mayū. kha said that women are to be assimilated to śūdras and so just as a sūdra can get the dattaboma performed through a brāhmaṇa, so a widow, though she cannot herself engage in homa, may employ a brāhmaṇa to perform the dattahoma, Vide H. Dh. vol. II. pp. 365-368 (for deterioration in the

position of women), and note 1262 above and V. Mayūkha quoted below. 1303 It has been held that the dattahoma is not 130 necessary among twice-born classes if the boy to be adopted belongs to the same gotra as that of the adoptive father. Jolly (in T. L. L. p. 160 ) states that the Dattakadarpapa refers to a text of Yama from the Sarasvativilāsa to the effect that homa is not absolutely essential in all cases. From Colebrooke's Digest V,4 CCLXXIII it appears that Jagannatha held the same view. The Dharmasindhu remarks that in certain countries an adop tion of a sagotra sapinda boy can be validly effected with the mere assent of the giver and adopter without Vedic ceremonies. There is a good deal of conflict in the case law on this point, which is passed over. Among sūdras no homa is necessary. The ceremony of adoption as described by Baud. gr. seṣasūtra II 6. 4-9 ( which is probably the oldest on record and which was the one to be followed by the Taittiriyas or followers of the Black Yajurveda, according to D. M., San. K. p. 177 and the Dharma sindhu p. 161 ) is as follows: When about to take (in adoption) the adopter makes ready (or collects) the following viz. two pieces of cloth, two ear-rings, a finger ring, an acārya ( officiat ing priest) who is well versed in the Veda, a bundle of kuśa grass, fuel sticks of palāśa (Butea Frondosa ). Then in the midst of invited relatives, after informing the ruler, he serves food to brāhmaṇas in the assembly hall or in the middle of the house. He ( the adopter) makes (the brāhmaṇas ) pronounce the benedictions May the day be auspicious! May you fare well! May there be prosperity !' and performs the acts (usual in all homas) from drawing lines on the altar up to carrying forward the Prapitā water, Vide H. of Dh. vol.

Then having offered oblations of clarified butter with the vyāhrtis 1306 he performs the acts from the offe ring to Agni Sviṣtakst down to the giving of the cow and pre sents. He (the adopter) gives as dakṣiṇā (fee) to the priest these very pieces of cloth and rings (with which the boy was deoked ). 

The procedure laid down by Saunaka, who appears to be much later than Baud., is somewhat different (though there is a good deal common to both ) and is meant for the students of the Rgveda (acc. to Sam. K. p. 175). A few salient points may be noted. The adopter should fast the previous day, he sbould offer madhuparka to the officiating priest, should perform all the details from the placing of fuel sticks on the fire up to the purification of clarified butter with the blades of kusa grass, The giver recites (when begged) the five verses beginning with 'ye yajñena'(Rg. X. 62. 1-5) and the adopter holds the boy with both hands while repeating the mantra “devasya tva' (Aśv. gr I. 20. 4), mutters the çkangad-angad' ( quoted above on p. 641 12.1202) and smells the boy on his head. The adopter offers boiled rice with Rg. V. 4. 10, X. 85, 38, X. 85. 41-46. A much more elaborate procedure is set out in the V. Mayūkha (pp. 120-12% text) and the Dharmasindhu (III pūrvārdha pp. 160-161). 

The results of adoption Adoption has the effect of trans ferring the adopted person from his natural family into the adoptive family. Adoption confers upon the adopted person the same rights and privileges in the family of adoption as the son

of the body (aurasa) except in a few well defined cages. The basic text on this point is that of Manu 1307 IX. 142 which may be literally rendered as follows: "The son given should not take tbe gotra (the family name) and the wealth of his natural father; the pinda (the cake of boiled rice offered to deceased ancestors in sraddhas ) follows the gatra and the wealth ( i. e. is invariably concomitant with them); of him who gives (his son in adoption) the svadha (obsequial rites) ceases (so far as that son is concerned)'. The preceding verse (Manu IX. 141) states that the adopted son takes the wealth of bis adoptive father and all that this verse says is that, after adoption, the son given in adoption does not take the name of his natural father and has no right in the wealth that then is the natural father's and that he does not perform the obsequial and śrāddha rites for his natural father. But from this verse a learned Hindu Judge derived the sweeping proposition that 'the theory of adoption depends upon the principle of a complete severance of the child adopted from the family in which he is born, both in respect to the paternal and maternal line, and his complete substitution into the adopter's family as if he were born in it'. There is no warrant for the idea of complete severance emphasized bere. This dictum was followed in many cases and was accepted by the Privy Counoil 1308 Another great Judge went so far as to

But this reading makes no change whatever in the meaning, since in ancient sūtras and smstis, the roots 'bhaj' and 'hr' and derivatives from them are used promiscuously in the same sense with regard to gotra and riktha.

say that 'an absolute adoption appears to operate as birth of the boy in the family of adoption and as civil death in the family of birth, having regard to the legal consequences that are incidents of such adoption o1309. But then the P. C, felt that matters were being carried too far and administered the warning 1310 that "As has been more than once observed the expressions 'civilly dead or as if he had never been born in the family are not for all purposes correct or logically applicable but they are complimentary to the term 'new birth'." We have to see what construction was put upon the verge of Manu by authoritative digests. The V. Mayūkha explains Manu IX. 142 and arrives at the conclusion that the four words gora, riktha, pinda and svadhū are not to be taken literally but they are only used to indicate all those consequences only in relation to the natural father and the like that are brought about by their connection with the piụda and the verse of Manu conveys the cessation of all those consequences only. It further adds that the son on being given away in adoption ceases to have similar relationship to his brother, paternal uncle (in the family of birth). It should be noted that the V. Mayūkha does not say that the son given away is dead to the family of birth or ceases to have any connection whatever with the members of the family of birth, but restricts the cessation of relation to the offering of piṇda and the taking of the estate after he is adopted. The D. M. quotes 1311 the Sm, C. (II. 289 ) and holds that by the gift the adopted son ceases to have the same gotra as the giver. The D. O. (pp. 23-24 ) states 1312 the same proposi tion, without naming the Sm. O. The learned Judges who had to decide cases of adoption, even if they knew Sanskrit, do not generally appear to have consulted authoritative works other than the few that had been translated and were quite unaware as

to whether even the cessation of the pinda and gotra and of the right to wealth when a son was given away was so universally accepted by the leading Dharmaśāstra works as they thought. The Sarasvativilasa (p. 394) quotes a text of Visnu 1313 that even the adopted son should perform the obsequial rites of the natural father and explains that Manu IX. 142 applies when the natural father has no issue at the time of his death. Rudraskanda on Khadira gr.III. 5. 16 says the same. Kamalakara, the author of the Nirṇayasindhu 1314 and a first cousin and contemporary of Nilakantha expressly states that Manu IX. 142 only applies when the natural fathor has a son or sons (other than the one given away) and quotes Katyāyana and Laugākṣi cited in the Pravaramanjari (p. 146) in support. The Dharmasindhu1315 also says that when a boy of another gotra is adopted after his upanayana is performed in the family of birth or when only the upanayana is performed by the adoptive father, the adopted boy should repeat both gotras at the time of bowing at the feet of elders or in brāddha and other rites; but when all the cere monies including the cūda are performed by the adoptive father then the adopted boy has only one gotra (viz. that of the adopter ). 

The plain meaning of the verse of Manu (IX. 142) is that when a man gives away his son in adoption, then that son is transferred into another family, does not perform the sraddha and similar rites for the giver and cannot claim to take the wealth of his natural father as a son on the father's death or demand a partition from his father. The other son or gons

of the giver are to perform the srāddhas for the father and to suoceed to the family wealth. But this verse has been twisted by some High Court decisions to yield another rule. Suppose A, a Hindu, has an only son B. On A's death B takes the whole ancestral property as the only surviving co-parcener and then B is given in adoption by his mother to X. Suppose B has a daughter C born to him before his adoption to X. Does B forfeit the estate taken by him as the last surviving male with the result that on B's adoption to X his daughter O takes the estate ( which had already vested absolutely in B) as if he was dead in the family of A. The Bombay High Court has held in two decisions that on B's 1316 adoption to X in the above illustration he loses or forfeits the property he took as the last surviving co-parcener in the family of A and his daughter C would take the estate of B as if he were then dead ( though he is actually living ). The result of these decisions is that the verge of Manu is construed as laying down that though a man may have been absolutely entitled to certain property as a member of one family, on his adoption into another family he loses that estate which then passes on to his heir as if he had died on the day of adoption. This construction of the verse of Manu has not been accepted by the Madras and Calcutta High Courts, 1317 which hold that an adoption does not divest any property which has Vested in a man previous to his adoption into another family, It may be noted that the Bombay High Court itself gave a deci sion 1318 which is inconsistent in principle with the two decisions

If on adoption a separated copar. cener is not divosted of the estate already takea by him at a partition because the share taken by bim cannot be said to be the estate of his Datural father withio the meaning of Manu IX. 142, the estate taken by a sole surviving co-parconer also cannot be divested by his subsequent adop tion, because at the adoption it bad ceased to be the estate of his natural father long before the adoption, because when a co-parcener dies his rights lapse to the other co-parceners and because the root cause of being entitled to partition and taking as surviving coparceper is the same viz. the birth right of a son under the Mitaksara. - .

cited above, when it held that where a father and his four song partitioned ancestral family property and one of the song was subsequently given in adoption into another family, the son 80 adopted was not divested by the subsequent adoption of the property already taken by the son on partition. In a still later case the Bombay High Court approves of its first decision in 40 Bom. 429 and observos : 1319 'the verse of Manu refers not only to the riktha of the natural father but also to the gotra of the natural father. It is quite clear that the gotra of the natural father is vested in the son by his birth. The gotra so vested in the-son ceases after the son is given in adoption. It is difficult to understand why the riktha which is spoken of in the same manner as gotra in the verse should not cease by the entire cessa tion of connection with the natural family. The gotra and riktha are inextricably joined together in a dvandva compound and it would follow logically as well as grammatically that the adopted son must lose both together and cannot lose the former and keep the latter.' In this passage the premiss that there is entire cessation of connection with the natural family is entirely wrong as has already been shown and will be shown a little later on. The adoptee's connection with the gotra of the natural family does not cease for all purposes at all. Therefore the reasoning of the passage quoted above is entirely misconceived and is further opposed to two well known rules of the Mimarsi evolved for the construction of texts. On: the interpretation given to Manu IX. 142 by the Bombay deci sions that verse lays down two rules (vidhis ), viz. (1) a person adopted into another family will not take the wealth of his natural father or any one in that family after adoption; (2) that a person adopted into another family loses or forfeite on adoption wealth that he may have already taken absolutely in the natural family as a member of that family before adoption. These are two entirely different propositions and the rule of mimamsā is that one and the same sentence 137 should not be construed as laying down two rules (vidhis) applicable to diffe rent sets of circumstances. To so construe a text is to be guilty

of the fault of vakyabheda (splitting up of a sentence 80 as to yield two distinot rules). The. V. Mayūkha construed Manu IX 14% so as to indicate only one sense and avoid the fault of vākyabheda on the analogy of two examples discussed in the Pūrvamimāṁsā 1321 works, but if the reasoning of the Bombay High Court were followed the same fault to avoid which Nila kantha strives hard would be committed. There is another mimāṁsā rule 1822 which will be violated by the Bombay High Court's interpretation of Manu IX. 142 vix, when an already existing thing or entity and something to be accomplished or brought about in future are spoken of together in a sentence the thing already existing or accomplished is mentioned simply for the sake of the thing to be accomplished. The aocomplished fact is adoption itself. Manu who mentions adoption or the adopted son which is an accomplished entity also mentions along with it the taking of property (rikthaharana); hence that taking must have reference to the future bringing about and not the undoing of rikthaharana which had already taken place long before. 

That the gotra of the natural family persists in some matters even after a person is adopted is made clear by the digests. The Sam. 1323 K, (p. 182) says that every dattaka must, when entering on marriage, avoid the gotra of his natural as also of his adoptive father. The Dharmasindhu (III. p. 161) says the same and states that the prohibition against marriage

with a girl of the gotras of the natural and adoptive fathers is absolute and not restrioted to saven or five degrees. Thus if there is no total or absolute cessation of gotra relation with the natural family for all purposes there is no reason why in the Case of wealth already taken before adoption there should be a cessation or forfeiture or why the cessation of relation as to riktha should not be restricted to the future. As regards sapiṇda relationship there is some conflict among the digests. The D, M. 1234 states that the dvyānusyāyana has to observe the prohibitions against marrying a sapiṇda girl up to three degrees in the families of the natural father and of the adoptive father, while the simple dattaka has to observe sapinda rela tionship based upon the presentation of rice balls in the adoptive father's family for three generations (since the adopted son can generally have no particles of the body in common with the adop tive father) and in the natural family sapinda relationship based upon particles of the same body for seven generations. The Nirnayasindhu (III. pp. 290-291) sets out the various conflicting views and gives it as its own opinion that the sapinda relation ship must be looked to in marriage up to seven generations in the natural as well as in the adoptive family (in the latter it being based on the offering of balls of rice). According to the V. Mayūkha (p. 119) the simple adopted son has sapiṇda rela tionship in the adoptive father's family for seven generations and in the adoptive mother's family for five generations and it seems to hold that there is no sapinda relationship in the natural family ( owing to Manu IX. 142). The D. C. (pp. 61 66 ) appears to hold that the dvyāmuṣyāyaṇa has to observe sapiṇda relationship (as stated in the D. M.), while as to the simple dattaka there is sapipda relationship only in the adop tive family for seven generations (as indicated by Manu IX. 142 ). The Dharmasindhu (III. p. 161) states that sapinda relationship depends in its degrees on the question whether the adoption is made after upanayana in the natural family or be foro upanayana or whether all samskāras from jatakarma are performed in the adoptive family.

:: The Bombay High Court 1325 has held that the adopted son cannot marry within prohibited degrees in the natural family, that to that extent an adopted son cannot be considered as not to have been born in his natural family and that the sapinda relationship is recognized in both the families for the purpose of prohibition of marriage. - The Nir, 8., the Dharmasindhu 1326 and the D. O. pp. 48-49 declare that the adopted son can perform the sraddha of his natural father if the latter has at his death no son or other qualified person to perform it. The Nir. S. and the Sar, 1327 K. (pp. 185-186)- both say that the adopted son has to observe three days' mourning on the death of the natural father and vice versa; but the D. M. and D. O. (p. 68 ) differ and state that the simple adopted son has to observe no mourning for his natural father or other relatives in the natural family. If a married man having a son is given in adoption (which is possi ble in the Bombay Presidency) the son (born before the adop tion) remains in the natural family and does not acquire the gotra and rights to property of the family into which his father is adopted. Yet the father who has gone into another family by adoption has been held to retain his right to give in adoption his son who was born before his own adoption and who remains in the natural family 1328 

From the above discussion it follows that the person adopted retains the tie of blood with his natural family ( 80 that he cannot marry a girl within the prohibited degrees from that family ), the samskāras already performed in the natural family are not repeated on him after adoption, he still-retains the gotra so far that he cannot marry a girl having the same gotra as his natural father and further he has according to most writers to observe mourning for his natural father. Therefore it is clear that the severance from the natural family brought about by adoption is only partial and restricted to piṇda and riktha

The adopted son is entitled to inherit in the adoptive family as fully as if he were a natural born son i. e. he may inherit not only to his adoptive father, but also to that father's brother or cousin if the latter have no son or no other nearer heir. The adopted son also inherits to the adoptive mother and her rela tions 1339 viz. her father and brother. Conversely, the adoptive mother and her relations in her father's family are entitled to inherit to him. 

Vas, and Baud. both laid down that if after a son is taken In adoption an aurasa son is born to the adoptive father the former takes a fourth share. There is confict among the smftis and the digests about the share of the adopted son when an aurasa is subsequently born, and about the meaning of 'a fourth share'. The Dayabhāga. (X. 13 p. 148) and V. C. p. 150 quote a verso of Katyāyana 1330 that when an aurasa son is born, other kinds of sons, if of the same caste as the father, take only a third of the estate. It has been held in Bengal that in these circumstances the adopted son takes one third of his adoptive father's estate. In Benares and among Jains 1331 the adopted son gets one fourth of the estate. The S. V. p. 393 holds that he gets 1332 7th. In Bombay it 1383, has been held that the adopted son takes not 7th of the whole estate, but ith of the share of the aurasa son i. e. Ith (the aurasa son taking $ths). In Bombay the same rule applies among śūdras. 1334 But in Bengal and Madras it has been decided, relying on a passage in the - 1329. a ut HOT fa sfarsitent APT affat gø formarvey Trang HATHAITI 4. t. p. 198; N F sinetron ATRO forum for I TU, P. 61.

Falugaratga va T FTY 7. . pp. 89-90. 1338a. It appears to me that the V. Mayūkha went far beyond the spirit of the ancient smrti texts and of most of the medieval digests when it allowed the adoption of a married man or even of one who had already had a son. The son to be adopted, it was declared by Saunaka and others, abould be a reflection of an aurasa son. Therefore he must be adopted at ad age when by proper training and environment he will come to eotertala towards the adoptive parents the same feeling that an aurasa son bas. Hence it appears to me that the Legislature should intervene and provide that no one can be adopted after his upanayana, or at all events after his marriage, in the datural family. It is natural for a sonloss man or a widow to feel, apart from religious considerations, the necessity of a young person o a solace, security and help in old age, and to adopt a person. Even la England by the Adoption of Chidren Act (16 and 17 Goo. V. chap. 29) the adoption of a minor is now allowed after observing cortain formalities, Further, ao adoption by a widow who has sot bocomo major according to the ladian Majority Act should be held valid. An agreement or a transfer of the smallest property by a person who is a minor according to that Act is bald to be absolutely null and void. There is no reason why an adoption by 4 widow of 15 or 16 should be uphold when that adoption diventa her of al (or now half of the property of the husband held by her. - : , ; 

## 29 Order of Succession After the Son

CHAPTER XXIX 

ORDER OF SUCCESSION AFTER THE SON 

It has been stated above that daya is either apratibandha or sapratibandha and that sons, grandsons and great-grandsons take the first kind of daya. If a man has no son either aurasa or secondary (viz. the dattaka, the other kinds of sons being now forbidden or obsolete), then his property devolvos in a certain order. When a man dies sonless and is a member of a joint Hindu family then on the surviving coparceners the whole estate devolves except that after 1937 (by Act XVIII of 1937) his widow takes his place as to the joint family property. But if he dies separated and has male issue (from whom also he is separate ) then his male issue will succeed to him in a body viz. his son, grandson (son of a predeceased son) and great grandson (son of a predeceased son's predeceased son) will together take his separate property per stirpes. From Manu IX. 137 ( which is the same as Vas. 17.5 and Viṣnu Dh. 8. 15. 46 ) and 186 and Yaj. I 78 it follows that the son, grandson and great grandson equally confer great spiritual benefit and so are the principal group of heirs. According to the strict theory of the Mitakṣarā as stated above, son, grandson and great-grandson take by birth an interest even in property acquired by a man him self, but they have no power to prevent him from alienating it. If one or more out of a man's sons, grand-sons or great-grandsons are separate from him then on his death his self-acquired property will first be taken by those sons, grandsons and great grandsons that are joint with him and if none of these is joint. with him, the separated son, grandson and great-grandson will Bucceed per stirpes to his estate, 1339 

This view is at least as old as the Baud. 1340 Dh. 8. 1. 5. 113 115 which speak of the three ascendants of a man, of himself,

of his full brothers and of his son, grandson and great-grand son from a bavarna wife as one group called avibhakta-daya sapindas and that in the absence of these only, the wealth of a man goes to his sakulyas. 

On the succession to the property of a man dying without male issue (i. 8. without son, grandson or great-grandson) the basic texts are two verses of Yājñavalkya 141 (II. 135-136 ): 'The lawfully wedded wife, the daughters and the daughter's son), the parents, the brothers, their sons, gotrajas (agnatic kingmen), bandhu (cognatic relation), a pupil, a fellow student-on failure of each preceding one out of these each succeeding one is entitled to take the wealth of a man who is dead ( lit. who has gone to heaven) and who leaves no male issue. This rule applies to all varnas', The Visṇu Dh. . (17. 4-15) is almost to the same effect. The word ' aputrasya' in Yāj. is taken to mean one having no son, grandson or great-grandson (at the time of death ) by V. C., Raghunandana and Mitramiśra 1343. The Mit. explains the words' to all varpas' as applying even to all that are the offspring of anuloma or pratiloma unions. 

We have separate rules for inheritance to the property of males and to that of females. Then there is great difference as to the rights of women as heirs. First, inheritance to the property of males will be taken up. Here again the fundamental principles are different aco, to the Mit. and the Dayabhāga.. 

Among the heirs (apart from male issue) of a man as regards his separate property the first is the widow. The wife's right to succeed to her deceased husband's estate, when he died separated and un-reunited, was acknowledged only after a long struggle extending over centuries. The passage of the Tal. 8. VI. 5. 8. 2 speaking of women as 'adayādih' has already

been quoted (on p.606). The meaning of that word is somewhat dubious, as will be shown later on. The Āp. Dh. 8. II. 6. 14. 2 states generally 1343 that in default of a son the nearest sapinda succeeds but does not expressly mention the wife as an heir, though it mentions ( in 11. 6. 14. 4) the daughter as a possible Hotr. Baud. also omits the wife as an heir. Vas. mentions no woman as heir. Gaut. 28. 19 appears to state that the wealth of one who dies without issue should be taken by his sapiṇdas, sagotras and sapravaras or his wife (i. e. according to Haradatta, the wife takes a share only along with the nearest sapinda or gagotra and not exclusively ). Haradatta himself was of this view. Manu does not declare that the wife is the heir of a sonless man and there are certain passages wbich impliedly exclude her, as 6. 8. Manu IX, 185 ( the father takes the wealth of a map dying sonlegs or his brothers take it ), IX, 217 (the mother should take the woalth of a sonless man). Saṅkha (q. by the Mit., Dayabhaga XI. 1. 15 ) prescribes that the wealth of a man dying without issue goes to his brothers, failing them the parents take it or the eldest wife. 1344 Devala (q. by the Dayabhaga XI. 1. 17-18 and V. R. p. 593 ) arranges the heirs in order as full brothers, daughters, father, half brothers, mother and wife. It may be noticed that in the days of Kalidasa the sonless widow did not succeed to the wealth of her deceased husband, but was only entitled to maintenance and that the estate escheated to the king. This is clear from the letter written by the minister to king Dugyanta about the wealth of a merchant who perished in a ship-wrook (.ACT VI). Yāj. and Vispu among empti writers were probably the first to clearly enunciate the rule that the wife was the foremost heir of a man dying without male issue. Br. makes the wife the first heir of a sonless man and supports his

opinion with reasons. He says : 1345 'In the Voda and in the doctrines of the smrtis and in popular usage the wife is declared to be half the body of the husband, equally sharing the consegu ences of good and evil acts. Of him whose wife is not dead half the body survives. How can another obtain the property, while half the body (of the deceased ) lives? Although kinsmen, although his father, mother or his relatives may be alive, the wife of a man dying without issue succeeds to his share, A wife dying before her husband takes away his sacred fires (i. e. she is cremated with the sacred Vedic fires, if he be an Agnihotrin); but when the husband dies before the wife, she takes his property, if she be chaste'. Even when Yaj. proclaim ed the paramount right of succession in the case of widows there were other smrtis and some early commentators who dia not subscribe to that view. Nār. ( dāyabhāga, 25-26 ) provides that if among several brothers one who is childless dies or becomes an ascetic the others should divide the property except ing stridhana, that they should make provision for his women till their death in case they remain faithful but if they are otherwise (i..e. unfaithful) they may cut off the allowance: Nār. (dāyabhāga, 50-51 ) provides that on failure of sons, the daughter, sakulyas, bandhus, a man of the same caste, the king succeed in order and thus omits the wife altogether. Vyāsa 1346 ( quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 28.19 and by Sm. O. II. p. 281 ) holds that a wife may take the whole of the husband's property if it does not exceed 2000 paṇas in value. The Mit. tells us that Srikara espoused this position that the wife takes the

the property is small, but only maintenance if the property 1s large and refutes it by saying that it is opposed to the spirit of Yii who allows & share to the wife and the mother oven along with sons when even joint family property is being partitioned and that the view is also liable to the fault of vidhivaizamya on the analogy of the Mimāmgā rule stated above on p. 605. 1347 The same text of Yāj. will have to be held as laying down only maintenance when the husband left great wealth, and also laying down a share equal to that of a son when the husband leaves inconsiderable wealth, 1347a Another view was maintained

The मिता. says that this really means that there are two courses open to the widow, viz. she may remaia cbaste and succeed along with the sapindas or she may resort to niyoga. 

1347a. Jai. VII. 3. 19-25 as understood by the Mit, may be briefly explaised as follows: The Cāturmāsyas (seasonal sacrifices) are four, Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapraghāsa, Sākamedba, Supāsiriya (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1091-1105 for description). In regard to these the following texts occur in tho Veda and are cited by Sabara and others : re: soranitesi

Pranayana means 

carrying towards the east fire from the Gārhapatya fire to the Abavaniya.' There is pranayana in the Darsapūrṇamāsa which is simple (and without details) and there is also pranayana ia Agaisjoma wbich is full of details (and not simple). An uttaravedi (vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 1096–1097 for description ) is not required in Darsapūrgamāsa, but it is required in a Soma sacrifice. The cāturmāsyas are modifications (vikrti) of the Darsapūrga māsa, so that whatever is prescribed in the latter follows in the absence of express directions as a matter of course in the formerIn the texts quoted above the words 'dvayoḥ pranayanti' lay down a vidhi and the words 

tarmād... takamed basca ' contain an arthavada which forms a syntactical whole with the vidbi and which only ealogizes it. The purvapaksa argues ; As cāturmāsyas aro modifications of Darśapūrnamāsa, it is unnecessary to lay down axprosaly a simple pranayana io them; therefore, the prapayana prescribed in dvayoḥ pranayapti' must be the pranayana as described in a Soms sacrifice. Further the prohibition of an uttaravedi in Vaisvaveda and Supisiriya indicates the same, since a prohibition implies tbat there was a faar that what is prohibited would bave otherwise followed and since an

by the Smṛtigangraha and Dhāro vara, viz. that the wife would 

(Continued from the last page) uttaravedi is required only in a Soma sacrifice. Therefore the pranayana prescribed in dvayoḥ pranayanti' is of the Somapranayana type. To this a partisan of the siddhāntin (siddhaotaikadesin) replies as follows:---The real view is that in dvayoḥ pranayanti the prapayana is of the simple darśa pūraamāsa type and the prohibition about Vaiśvadeva and Sunāsiriya is not to be explained as you do; in the words 'upātra vapanti' an uttaravedi is generally (without exception) prescribed for all cāturmāsyas, but in the following two sentences 'na vaiśvadeve &c.' the preparation of uttaravedi is forbidden in the case of Vaisvadeva and Sunāsiriya ; therefore the partisan says that the idea is that, though the pranayana is of the simple darśapūrna māsa type, yet an uttaravedi is prepared in the 2nd and 3rd but not in the first and fourth of the cāturmāsyas. The pūrvapaksin retorts that even on this construction vidhivaiṣamya would still be tliere as follows: as there is prescription of uttaravedi in all four and prohibition in two (viz, the first and fourth of the four cāturmāsyas), there is an option of uttaravedi in these latter two (as the rule is 'tulyabala-virodhe vikalpaḥ') and there is no option as to the other two and there will arise the fault of vidhivaiṣanya, the same sentence viz. 'upātra vapanti' being taken as an unqualified and independent rule about the 2nd and 3rd of the cāturmāsyas and taken as an optional rule as to the Ist and 4th. 

The proper siddhanta view is as follows: Though the words 'dvayol pranayanti' are very general, they are to be narrowed down so as to refer to only two (viz. 2nd and 3rd of the cāturmāsyas) on account of the recom mendatory passage that follows ( speaking of Varunapragbasa and Sākamedha as the thighs of cāturmāsya yajña). The vidhi and the following arthavada form one syntactical whole (ekavākya), as laid down by Jai, 1. 2. 7. The arthavāda passage means that just as a man marches on in strength if his thighs are strong, so the cāturmāsya sacrifice reaches a successful close by means of Varunapragbāsa and Sākamedha in which an uttarvedi is specially prepared and fire is laid thereon (being taken from the āhavaniya fire by the adhvaryu and pratiprasthātr). Therefore the meaning is that there is prana yana in the 2nd and 3rd out of the four cāturmāsyas and uttaravedi is pres cribed in those two alone and the words 'there is no uttaravedi in Vaisva deva and Sunāsiriya' are a mere anuvada (repetition of what is already known) and not a probibition, as in the words 'fire should be kindled on the carth and not in the sky nor in heaven'. On this interpretation there is no vidhivaisamya. Sabara makes two adhikaranas of Jai, VII. 3. 19-25, while Kumārila makes one adhikarana of these seven sutras, He further differs as to the siddbāate, which, according to him, is that in dvayoh pranayanti' there is a special (apūrva) kind of pranayana prescribed, prākrta (of darśapūrnamāsa type) and saumika pranayana being the two other views which he rejects. The Subodhini on the Mit. very lucidly explains this discussion and concludes: यथा सकदेशिमते विधिवैषम्य दोषस्तथा

take the estate of her sonless deceased husband if she submitted to niyoga and procured a son for the husband. This view derived support from Gautama 28.19-20, Vas. 17.65 (who prohibits niyoga if resorted to through greed of wealth), and Manu IX: 146 and 190 ( which call upon the surviving brother to pro create a son on the widow of his brother and to hand over the deceased's share to that son).

The Mit. after an elaborate statement and refutation of the views of Srikara, Dhāreśvara and others due to the conflict among smrti texts on the question of the widow's right of succession, establishes the proposition that the widow, if chaste, is entitled to the whole of her deceased sonless husband's wealth, 1350 Almost all writers since the time of the Mit. accept the widow's right to succeed to her husband's wealth. Many writers note that the smrti texts on the heirship of the widow are in conflict. 1351 They explain verses like those of Nar. (dayabhaga 25-26) providing only maintenance for women either as

referring to exolusively kept concubines of the deceased or to the wives of re-united coparceners. 

Patni means a woman wbo is married to the deceased, the word being formed from. 'pati' with an affix in the genge of 'being fit to join with the husband in the performance of sacri fice' (Pāṇini IV. 1. 33). The Sm. C. II. p. 290 quotes a Verge that a woman who is procured for sexual intercourse in exchange for money is only a dāsi and is not a patni and therefore is not entitled to inherit to a sonless paramour. 1352 The Baud. Dh. S. 1. 11. 20 quotes a similar verse. Several texts require that the widow must be chaste before she can claim the inheritance of the deceased. A text attributed to Vṛddha Manu 1353 says, 'The wife alone, being sonless and keeping the bed of her lord unsullied and leading a life of religious obger vances, may offer pinda to her deceased husband and take his entire estate'. Kāt. ( 926 ) also declares that 'the wife who is chaste takes the wealth of her husband'. The widow must be chaste at the time the inheritance opens. The courts have held that once the husband's estate is Tested in the widow, it will not be divested or forfeited by reason of unchastity subsequent to the death of the husband. 1354 If the widow remarries after inheriting, then, though the remarriage of a widow is legalized by the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act.(XV of 1856 ), she forfeits the estate of the husband taken by her or the estate which she took as a widowed mother of her deceased son and it passes to the other heirs of the husband or son as if she were then dead and this applies to widows of all castes according to almost all High Courts ( even when remarriage

is allowed by the custom of the caste to which the widow belongs ). 1355 

According to the Dayabhāga there being no apratibandha daya, the widow of a sonless member even in a joint family succeeds to his share in the family property and there is no difference between joint family property and separate property. 

In the case of sūdras, if the owner dies leaving a widow or a daughter or a daughter's son and an illegitimate son, it has been held by the courts following Yaj. II. 134, the Mit, and Dayabhāga IX. 31 that the widow or daughter or daughter's son takes one half and the illegitimate son takes the other half. 1356 

The rights of the widow in property inherited by her from her husband are limited. Kauṭ, III, 2 was 1357 probably the first to propound clearly the characteristics of the Hindu widow's estate and the verse of Kat. quoted below is remarkably close to the words of Kaut. The Mahabharata (Anuśāsana 47, 24 ) states that women have only the right to enjoy the estate of their husbands and that they should not waste or destroy the

B.) holds that a woman belonging to a caste in wbich remarriage of widows is allowed by custom does not forfeit on remarriage the estate of the Grst husband which she took as his widow, the principal reasons being that there is no express text about forfeiture on subsequent unchastity and that it would be absurd to hold that a widow, who, on the P. C. ruling in 7 1, A., does not forfelt the estate taken as heir by subsequent unchastity, should be liable to forfeit it by remarriage (which presumes that she wants to live a decent life). Looking to the expressed object of the Hipdu Widows' Remarriage Act, section 2 should not have been $0 interpreted as to apply to widows who could remarry according to caste custom before the Act.

Characteristics of widow's estate

husband's estate (by gift, sale &c.). Br. 1538 (S. B. E. vol. 33 pp. 377-78 verses 50-51 and 53 ) states : 'when the husband is separate his widow takes all his various kinds of property such as a pledge, except immovable property. After having received movable and immovable property, gold, inferior metals, grain, liquids and clothes the widow shall cause (her husband's) monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas to be performed. Let her honour with funeral offerings and pious charity her husband's paternal uncle, gurus ( elders ), daughter's son, sister's son and maternal uncle as also aged or helpless persons, guests and women'. Mādhava (Par. M. III. p. 536 ) explains that 'except immovable property' means that she is prohibited from making a sale of immovable property without the consent of the male kinsmen. The V. Mayūkha (p. 138 ) accepts this interpretation and modern courts have done the same. In Damodardas v. Purmanandas y Bom. 155 it was held that a widow to whom movable property was bequeathed by the will of her husband takes it absolutely. But here the movable property was not inherited by her and as it was a bequest by will it became her stridhana according to Nār. ( q. by V. M. on p. 155 ). Besides, this was a cage from Bombay Island and was governed by the law of V. Mayūkha. In some early cases in Bombay it had been held that a widow in Western India under the Mitākṣarā had absolute power over the movable property inherited by her from her husband. In Gadadhar 1. Chandrabhagabai 17 Bom. 690 (F. B.) it was held that under the law of the Mitākṣarā a widow has no power to bequeath move able property inherited by her from her husband and that to that extent the decision in Damodar v. Purmanandas must be treated as of no authority if it be interpreted to have decided the point in that way. In Sha Chamanlal v. Doshi Ganesh 28 Bom, 453 it was decided that even under the Mayūkha a widow inheriting movable property from her husband has no

power to dispose of it by will. Lastly in Pandharinath v. Govind 32 Bom. 59 it was held, after an elaborate examination of authorities, that a widow is not under the Mitakṣarā competent to make a gift of the movables inherited by her from her husband and it was said (on p.75 ) that possibly with the spread of education amongst, and the general emancipa. tion of, their women Hindus may be led to call in aid the relief of Legislature. In cases arising under the Mayūkha & widow may dispose of movable property inherited by her from her husband by gift inter vivos but not by will. Kat. 1359 (921, 924-925) propounds the limitations of the widow's rights as follows: ' A sonless widow, preserving the bed of her husband (unsullied) and residing with her elders and being self-controlled, should enjoy (her husband's property ) till her death; after her the (other) heirs (of the husband) would get it. A wife who preserves ( the honour of) the family would get the share of her husband when he is dead till her death, but she has no power to make a gift, sale or mortgage. A widow engrossed in religious observances and fasts, fixed in the vow of celibacy, always intent on restraining her senses and making gifts goos to heaven oven though sonless', 1360 These verses show that the widow was to enjoy the income of her husband's property till her death; that she could not sell or mortgage or give away immovable property without the consent of the heirs that would come after her and that for religious and charitable purposes or those that conduce to the spiritual welfare of her husband a widow had large powers of disposition. These rules

Limitations on widow's estate 

have been accepted by modern decisions; vide Collector of Masulipatam v. Cavaly Vencatu 8 Moo. I. A. 500 at p. 551 for an oftquoted pagsage about the widow's powers of disposal. There is a large volume of case law on the widow's powers of aliena tion, on what are religious and charitable purposes and about the consent of the kinsmen, which have to be passed over here. The heir or heirs expectant on the death of a widow are called reversioners or reversionary heirs in the decided cases. There is no exact Sanskrit word to convey the same idea except * dāyāda' that occurs in Kāt. quoted above and in D. B., which makes it clear that the reversioners take the estate after the widow's estate ends ( by death, remarriage, surrender &c.). The doctrine of the surrender by the widow of her estate in favour of the next heirs (the reversioners ) whose estate is said to be accelerated is based on meagre foundations viz. the words of Kat, and the D. B. quoted in n. 1359. Judicial decisions, how over, have raised a stupendous structure on these slight founda tions ; but they are passed over here. 

If a man dies leaving several widows then they may partition the property equally among themselves, as stated by the Mit. 1361 

If after partitioning among themselves, one of the widows dies, the portion given to her comes to the other widow or widows i, e, there is survivorship among them and no one else can succeed to the husband's property as long as there is any widow alive and not remarried. Hindu Law does not favour the distribution of a deceased man's estate among his several relatives, as some other systems (like that of the Moslems) do. It gives the whole estate to one heir or one class of heirs to the exclusion of all others. It is greatly to the credit of the ancient Hindu Law that it boldly gave all the separate property of a deceased male to women, viz. to the widow and after her to the daughter in preference to the man's own father or brother or nephew. Attempts are now being made through the Legislature that even when there are sons, the widow and daughters of the deceased should be given shares. Though these efforts spring from the laudable motive of en larging the rights of women, they do not deserve unqualified encouragement. They will produce friotion, cause fragmenta

tion of lands, make holdings uneconomic and it is extremely doubtful whether they are in the best interests of society or nation as a whole and whether the vast mass of Hindus want them. Prajapati 1362 says that the king should punish as thieves those sapiṇdas and relatives that oppose or obstruct a widow in succeeding to her husband's estate. 

The words of the Tai S. quoted above (p. 606 ) about women being without strength and not entitled to dāya (adāyādih) really occur in the ritual of Soma offerings and should mean that women are not allowed to share in the drinking of Soma. But the Baud, Dh. S. (8. B. E. vol. 14 p. 231 ) appears to have taken them as excluding women from inheritance. Manu IX. 18 also relies on it and declares that the samskūras on women (except marriage) are not to be performed with Vedic mantras, as the Veda declares them to be 'nirindriya' and 'anta'. Later writers like Haradatta (on Gaut. 28. 19, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 1) and V. P. pp. 517 and 554 base the exclusion of women from inheritance on this passage of the Veda. They say that, though the Vedic text is very sweeping and general, it is meant to oxclude only women other than those expressly mentioned in the smrtis as entitled to inherit. For example, the Dāyabhāga XI. 6. 11 quotes Baud. and remarks that the wife is entitled to inherit because of special texts (like those of Yāj. and Vispu) in her favour, The Sm, C. II. p. 294 1363 says that the Vedic passage is only an arthavāda (meant for praise ) and not an absolute rule and it must be taken as not referring to those women that are expressly mentioned (lit. by being seized by the horn). The V. P. says the same. Aparārka (p. 743 ) holds that the Vedic passage is merely an anuvada and excludes women only when there is a son. It should be noted that the Par. M. (II. p. 536) holds that the Tai. S. passage merely means that the wife of the sacrificer is not entitled to partake of Soma

taken in the Pātnivata cup and that 'indriya' means Soma drink. 134 "But Madhavācarya in his comment on the Tai, S. I. 4.27 quotes Tai. S. VI. 5. 8. 2 and explains it somewhat differently 88 meaning that women being without strength do not take the heritage when there are children. It is very remarkable that both the Mit. and the V. Mayūkha do not at all refer to the Tai. 8. or Baud. Dh. 8. in speaking of the rights of women to inheritance. It cannot be said that they were unaware of them, but probably they took the Tai. S, text in the sense in which the Par. M. explains it. The result of the reliance on the Tai. S. and on Baud. by most medieval digests has been that in the whole of India except in the Madras and Bombay provinces only five females are recognized as heirs viz. the widow, the daughter, the mother, the father's mother and paternal grand-father's mother, because they were expressly mentioned as heirs in the smftis or early commentaries. This 

subject will be pursued further a little later on. 

• The right of the wife to maintenance during her husband's life time has already been dealt with in H. of Dh. II. pp. 568-569. If the wife was guilty of unchastity but repented of her lapse, she was still entitled to be maintained by the husband ( vide H. of Dh. II. pp. 571-573 ). As regards the rights of mainten ance of the widows of deceased members of a joint Hindu family there is a good deal of case law which is passed over here. One or two points may be noted. The right of the widows in a joint Hindu family are conditional upon their leading a life of chastity. Male members are often unwilling to maintain widows who are often compelled to go to court. In the 'Selections from Peshwa Daftar', vol. 43, there is an order ( letter No. 14% ).of Rāmagāstri, the chief justice of the Peshwa's court, calling upon one Bapuji Tambavekar under threat of penalties to restore the ornaments of the widow of his elder brother (that had died only seven days after marriage ) and to give her yearly maintenance of Rs. 125.

History of Dharmasastra - I Vol. struggle hard for recognition as hoir just as the widow had. Gaut., Baud. and Vas. omit the daughter as an heir. Āp. Dh. 8. II. 6. 143 recognizes the daughter as an optional hotr (probably with sapindas). When Manu IX, 130 declares, 'one's Bon is like one's self and one's daughter is equal to one's son ; how can another person take the wealth of the deceased) when she who is the very self (of the deceased) lives', it appears from the context (IX. 128-129) that it is the pritrika ( the daughter appointed as a son) that is intended to be referred to therein. Medhatithi, Narayapa and Kullūka interpret the word * duhita ' in Manu IX, 130 as applicable to the putrikā only. In the Nirukta,135 Yaska cites Rg. III. 31. 1 as relied upon by those who support the claims of the daughter to inheritance and also derives the word 'duhitā' in various ways, but from his expla nation of Rg. III. 31. 1 it appears that he is referring to the putrika's right of inheritance. As the usage of appointing a daughter as a son became gradually obsolete, the ordinary daughter came to be recognized by analogy as the heir of a sonloss man after the widow. Yaj. and Viṣnu both recognize the daughter as an heir after the widow. Nar. (dāyabhāga, 50 ) recognizes 1356 the daughter as an heir after the son on the ground that she continues the lineage ( of the deceased father) just like & son. When Nar. (dāyabhaga, 27 ) speaks of the daughter being entitled to maintenance till marriage, the con text shows ( as remarked by the Sm. O. II. p. 296 ) that he is referring to the daughter of a person who was re-united at the time of his death. Br. declares 1367 ( 8. B. E. 33 p. 378 verkar 55-56 ), the wife is declared to be the inheritor of the husband's wealth and, in default of har, the daughter; the daughter, like a son, springs from the limbs of a man: how can another man inherit her father's property while she lives?', Though the words of Yaj., Viṣṇu and Bș. were clear enough ancient com.

mentators were not prepared to accept them in their literal Pense. . Visvaripa holds that Yaj. means only the putrika and employs the plural in order to convey that several daughters may be appointed as sons. The Sm. O. II. p. 295 informs us that the same opinion was held by Dhāreśvara, Davasvamin and Devarāta. 1368 . The Mit. rightly refutes these views by saying that the word ' duhitarah in Yaj. cannot refer to 'putrika', since Yaj., has himself stated the putrikā as equal to the aurasa son (in II. 128), as the putrika is included among the sons by Vas, and as the widow and the daughters are declared by him as heirs in the absence of all the sons, principal and secon dary. Yaj., Viṣnu, Bf. are silent as to whether any discrimina tion was made between daughters as heirs. Kat. (926) gives1369 a preference to the unmarried daughter and the Mit. and the subsequent digests follow Kate The Dayabhaga1370 (XI.2.4 p. 175) quotes a prose passage of Parasara preferring an un married daughter as an heir to a married daughter. Among married daughters the Mit., pressing into service a text of Gaut. on succession to stridhana, holds by analogy that among married daughters the indigent (or unprovided for) one is to be preferred to one who is well-placed. 1371 Heroin the Miti follows common sense and the natural inclination of a father to feel more concern for a poor daughter. The Dayabbage prefers the unmarried daughter to the married daughter as la done by the Mit., but among married daughters Jimātaythana, following an author oalled Dikṣita, prefers one who has had a

son or who is likely to have a son to a widowed or barren daughter or to one who has given birth only to daughters. This preference is due to the principle of the Dayabhāga 1373 that spiritual benefit is the governing factor in succession. The barren daughter or widowed daughter is unable to confor spiritual benefit on her father since she will have no son that will offer pindas to the deceased owner (who will be the mater nal grand-father). The Mit. on the other hand relies on near ness of blood (prattyāsatti) as the guiding principle. But, de pointed out by the V. P. p. 519, the Dayabhāga is inconsistent. There is no reason on its own principle why the unmarried daughter should be preferred to a married daughter who has a son. The latter is then and there capable of conferring spiri tual benefit while it is problematical whether the unmarried daughter will confer spiritual benefit (since she may after all be blessed with no son after marriage ). Aparārka (p.721 ) and V. R. (p. 517) give three meanings of the word ' apratisthita' vis. 'childless, poor, widowed'. In deciding whether a parti oular married daughter is indigent as compared with another, the Courts refuse 1373 to go into nice or minute questions of the respective monetary positions of their husbands and prefer one to the other only if there is great disparity or marked difference between their positions.

According to all High Courts in India except that of Bombay a daughter's estate is similar to that of the widow, She takes only a limited interest, can only enjoy the usufruot of the property and cannot alienate it. On her death the estate passée not to her heirs, but to the next heir of her father. In Bombay, 1374 however, the daughter takes an absolute interest

Succession of daughters 

717 

In her father's estate when she succeeds as heir and on her death the estate will go to her own heirs. 

A daughter is entitled to succeed, according to the decided cases, to her father's estate even if she be unchaste at the time of his death (except in cases governed by the Dayabhāga ).1375 The reagon assigned is that Kāt, and other smrti writers do not expressly mention the requirement of chastity in the case of the daughter or mother as they do as regards the widow. According to the 1376 Dayabhaga (XI. 2. 8) Bp. declares : 'a daughter equal in caste to the father and married to a husband of the same caste as her own, who is virtuous and intent on serving her husband, inherits her father's property'. Therefore \#-daughter who is unchaste cannot inherit. Further a daughter Buoceeds not because she is the daughter, but because she satisfies all conditions laid down by Bș. The Dayabhāga ( XI. 2. 31 ) further says that the word 'wife' (in XI. 1. 56) is merely Illustrative and whatever restrictions are imposed on the wife apply to all women as heirs. The illegitimate daughter, even of a sūdra, has no right of inheritance to her father. 1377 

By virtue of local or family custom daughters have in some cases been held to be excluded from inheritance, 1378 . . It may be noted that in his Vaijayanti ( on Viṣnu Dh. 8. XVII. 5-6) Nandapandita appears to have preferred a daughter in-law to a daughter; but he stands practically alone in this. Vide Jolly's T. L. L. p. 199 and p. 286 for quotation which however is not found in the D. O. Ms. No. 69 of the Vaijayanti. The daughter-in-law is not an heir at all in the whole of India,

Ascept in Bombay ( where she inherits, as the widow of a gotraja sapinda). The Balambhatti oritioizes Nandapandita without naming him and holds that a daughter-in-law inherits only as a 

otraja and not before a daughter. P... Raghunandana in his comment on the Dayabbāga makes the position about unchaste daughters quite clear 1379. The antis give preference among daughters to an unmarried daughter i. a. to a daughter who is a virgin ( kumāri). It has béon held by the Indian High Courts that though chastity is not required in the case of daughters to entitle them to inherit, yet in a competition between a married daughter and a daughter who was never married, but became a concubine or prostitute, the latter would be postponed to the former as the lātter is not a virgin though unmarried. Some emptis like Partsara 1300 employ the word kumāri in speaking of daughters' Buodession, while others employ the word 'kanya', but both words are synonymous. In Govind v. Bhiku 46 Bom. L. R. 699, where & man died leaving as heirs & married daughter and another daughter who never married, but was living as the permanent concubine of another man, it was held that the latter 'cannot inherit the property of her sonless father to the exclusion of or along with his married daughter. The old texts speak of only unmarried daughters and married daughters and prefer the former to the latter. Medhatithi on Manu IX. 132 says that kanya means a girl who has had no sexual intercourse with any man. The Mit, makes three classes of daughters suoceed one after another viz. (1) unmarried daughter, (2) indigent married daughter, (3) well-to-do married daughter. Judicial decisions have added a fourth yariety viz. unmarried daughter who has become a prostitute. This fourth olags being a new one must be pleoed after the other three classes expressly mentioned by the texte and commentaries on the basis of the maxim (intrudere of uninvited persons must be seated at the end of or after those

• The daughter's son ( dauhitra). On failure of daughters the daughter's son inherits. Gaut., Ap., Vas., are all silent about the daughter's son and so are Yaj. and Viṣnu. But it has been plausibly urged by Visvarūpa that, since 1381 Yāj. himself has (in II. 134 ) stated that the illegitimate son of a sūdra takes the whole estate if there be no legitimate son provided there exista no heir up to the daughter's son, the latter must have been intended to be an heir by Yāj. taking after the daughters. The Madanapārijāta (p. 672) relies on the word 'oa' in Yaj. to bring in the daughter's son. Though the printed text of Viṣnu Dh. 8. is silent about the daughter's son, the Mit., the Daya. bbāga and others quote a verse of Viṣnu, 1382 ' when there is no continuance of lineage through sons and son's son the daughter's Bons take the wealth (of the deceased owner); in offering srāddha to the ancestora, daughter's sons are regarded as son's song'. The V. Mayūkha (p. 142 ) includes a sūtra about the dauhitra in Vinnu Dh. S. Govindaraja, a commentator of Manu, is said by the Dāyabhaga, to have held, relying on this verse of Viṣnu, that the daughter's son inherited tille estate even before a married daughter of the deceased. But the Dayabhāga did not approve of this view. The Diyabhāga (XI. 2. 27 ) notes that Balaka held that as the daughter's son was not expressly named by Yaj. he came in as an heir after all those that were expressly mentioned as heirs. Baud. Dh. 8.

should inherit the entire wealth of a sonless man, that he should offer one pinda to his father and another to the maternal grand. father and that in religious matters. there is no difference between a son's son and a daughter's son, since their father and mother (respectively) spring from the body of the deceased owner. The context and the wording of these verses show, as held by Kullūka and other commentators, that the daughter's son here referred to is the son of the appointed daughter. But Manu IX. 136 is somewhat clearer. It says, through a son born to a daughter from a husband of the same class, whether she be appointed ( as a son) or not, the maternal grand-father becomes one having a son's son; that son should offer pinda and take the wealth of the maternal grandfather'. The Mit. takes the word 'akrta' in this verse as referring to the ordi nary daughter, while Medhatithi and Kullūka hold that this Verse also only refers to the son of the putrika and that krt. means an appointed daughter with regard to whom an express agreement was made with her husband, while akstā means one (who is intended mentally to be appointed as a son) about whom there is no such express agreement. Bṛ. (8. B. E. 33 p. 379 verse 58 ) provides : 'just as (the daughter ) gets ownership in her father's property (as an heir ), though įthere may be other relatives, so her son also becomes the owner of his mother's and maternal grand-father's property : 1384 

The daughter's sons inherit per capita and not per stirpes, Suppose that A has two daughters B and C, that B has three Bons and C has two sons, that then both B and C. die in A's Botime; on A's death his estate will be divided into five parts, 

each daughter's son taking one fifth. .' 

A daughter's son is really a bandhu and a bhinnagotra sapinda, but owing to historical causes and the high religious efficacy of the srāddha offered by him he has been given a very high place among heirs by express texts.

Father and mother as heirs

Viṣnu Dh. 1385 S. as read by most digests places the father before the mother. Manu IX. 217 states that when the son dies issueless the mother takes his wealth, while Manu IX. 185 provides that the father takes the wealth of a sonless man and the brothers also. So Manu is not definite about the preference among parents. Kat. (927) observes, 1356 'of a sonless man (the heirs ) are declared to be the wife of good family, the daughters, the father on failure of them, the inother, the brother and the brother's) sons'. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 v. 63) says,1387 'when a son dies without leaving his own wife or male issue, his mother is to be considered as her son's heir or a brother may succeed with the consent of the mother'. In this conflict it may be stated that the Mit., the Madanapārijāta, S. V. (p. 416 ), the V.C., the V. P. prefer the mother to the father; while the Dayabhaga, the Sm. C., the Madanaratna, the V. Mayakha prefer the father to the mother. Srikara 1388 held that both parents, if alive, succeed together. But the Dayabhāga, Sm. C.

The वि. र. p. 595 and वि. चि. p. 151 reverse the order and read तदभावे मानुगामि तदभावे पितृगामि, But the व्य. प्र. p. 524 notes that such an order is found in no other work and so must be taken to be a mistake, Even the printed मिता. reads पितृगामि first. तस्मात्स्मृतिचन्द्रिका-मदनरत्नकार-कल्पतरु रस्ना. कर-पारिजातकारमभूतीनां बहूना पितुरभावे मातुः पुत्रधनाधिकार इत्येव सिद्धान्तः । पाच स्पतिमा त तदभावे मातृगामि तदभावे पितृगामि इति वृह द्विष्णुवचनं पठित्वा यथामिताक्षर मेव सिद्धान्तितम् । स कुत्रापि तदतिरिक्तग्रन्धे तथा पाठस्यालिखना भ्रान्तिविलसितमेव । ग्य. म. p. 524. It is, however, to be noted that in the printed वि. र. (p. 592) the father is placed after the mother (मातुरभावे पित्रादीनामधिकारस्य स्थितत्वात् ). So it is probable that the text of the वि. र. was tampered with after the time of मित्रमिश्र..

and others criticise this view. The reasons why the Mit. prefers the mother before the father are three, out of which two are based on grammar. The word 'pitarau ' in Yāj. is what is called an 'ekasesa' dvandra compound and in dissolving it or in the full-fledged dvandva the mother comes first in order and hence she should be preferred. Another reason is : 1389 A father may have several wives and song from them all, so that a mother is directly related to her own son only and not to the other sons of her husband. So ( the Mit, says ) the mother has greater nearness (prattyāsatti) to her son than the father has. The Sm. C. (II. p. 297) refers to Jai. V. 1. 14 where the Vedio sentencesārasvatau bhavataḥ' is interpreted and it is stated that the first oblation is offered to Sarasvati because the Yājyā and Anuvākyā verses as first set out are meant for Sarasvati (and not on the ground of the method in which the ekaśeṣa is dissolved); therefore as to pitarau also no reliance should be placed on the dissolution of the compound. Nilakantha in the V. Mayūkha denies the assumptions based upon grammar, says that Pāṇ. does not direct that in dissolving the compound the word mātā must be employed first and there is no authority for doing so, 1390 But the V. P. says that though Pāṇini may 

1389. पिता सपत्नीपुत्रेष्यपि साधारणः । माता तु न साधारणीति प्रत्यासत्यति शयोस्तीति विमलम्भसशमिदं न हि जननीजनकयोर्जन्यं प्रति समिकर्षतारतम्यमस्ति । way. II, p. 297. 

1390. The general rule is that several words that would be in the same case when separately used may be compounded together to form a dvandva, when they are employed to convey the sense of 'ca', as said in 'carthe dvandvah' (Pān. II. 2. 297. Such a compound is called dvandva and mātā-pitarau is an example of it. Another sūtra (I. 2. 64) of Pāṇini states that when words denoting several individuals of the same kind are to be compounded together, only one of them may be retained and that is called an ekaśeṣa compound, which is of two kinds, sarīpa (e. g. hamsasca hamsasca bansau) and virupa ( when the two words are of different genders). The latter kind of ekaśesa is of restricted use. In such a compound when a male and female are asso ciated together only the word in the masculine gender remains or the word 

pits' when compounded with mātr (vide Pān. I. 2. 67 and 1. 2. 70). There fore we have two forms to denote the idea of parents viz. matapitarau or pitarau, Io dissolving this compound (pitarau ) we employ the phraseology mātā ca pitā ca and in the word 'nātāpitarau' the word for mother comes first. Therefore among parents as beirs mother should come first. Vide pp. 242-244 of my notes to the V. Mayūkba (ed, of text) wbere both the Mit. passage and its criticism by the V. Mayūkha are explained at length. In Balkrishna v. Lakshman 14 Bom. 603 both the Mit. and Mayūkha's criticism thereof are set out (pp. 608-609).

Preference among parents

contain no such direction, all grammatical works like the Kaśikā dissolve the compound as mātā ca pitā ca' and gram matical usage for centuries supports the argument that the word mātā, comes first 1391. The argument about the mother being nearer is quite specious. Looked at from the son (whose inheritance is in question), the mother and father are both equally proximate. The V. P. holds that according to the maxim that even a slight ground of difference leads one to determine (priority) the mother should be preferred to the father ( since we dissolve the compound as mātā ca pitā ca). The V. P. (p. 525) further tries to get over the text of Visnu (putting the father before the mother) by explaining that if the mother is most worthy as a pativratū and the father an ordinary man she should be preferred but if the father is more worthy than the mother he should be preferred. Hardly any one sup ports V. P, and the courts have not followed this. Owing to the difference of opinion among the digests on the question of the preference between parents as heirs, queer results follow. For example, in the province of Bombay itself the father is pre ferred as an heir to the mother in Gujerat, the island of Bombay and in Northern Konkan (because in these regions the V. Mayūkha has been held to be of paramount authority ), while in the rest of the Bombay Presidency the mother is preferred to the father as an heir. The inother takes a limited interest as an heir which is the same as the interest taken by a widow as heir to her husband. The father would take an absolute inte rest. The word mother includes an adoptive mother; that is, if an adopted son dies leaving no son, widow, daughter or daughter's son, the adoptive mother would succeed 1392 to him as an heir (and even in preference to the adoptive father in those provinces where the Mit. is the supreme authority). In the case of a dvyāmugyāyana adoption, if the son adopted in that form dies leaving only his adoptive mother and natural mother, it has been held that both the mothers take his estate

as co-heiresses. 1333 It has further been held that if, after suc ceeding as adoptive mother to a dvyāmuṣyāyana son, the adop tive mother again adopts a son, the latter does not deprive the natural mother of the half share taken by her as heir of the deceased dvyāmuṇyāyaṇa son. 

The word 'mother' in the Mit. does not include a step mother. The latter is not recognised as an heir of her step-son at all in the whole of India (except in Bombay) on account of the rule of the exclusion of women from inheritance 1394 except where texts expressly mention them as heirs and the property would go to the crown instead of to the step-mother, if the latter alone were left, but she would be entitled to maintenance. In Bombay the step-mother would inherit as the widow of a gotraja sapinda, but she is assigned a remote 1395 place among gotraja sapiṇdas. If a widow remarries and then her son by her first husband dies without leaving a child, a widow, a daughter or daughter's son his remarried mother is allowed to inherit to him by the 1396 Boinbay High Court, though if she inherited first as a mother and then remarried, she is held by the same court to forfeit the inheritance taken (on account of section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act of 1856). 

The mother succeeding to her son takes only a limited estate i. e. she cannot alienate it except for legal necessity. If Vijñāneśvara's definition of stridhana be literally interpreted even property inherited from a son would be stridhana. There is a striking example in E. I vol. XIV p. 83 ( the Srirangam plates of Mummadi Nayaka in sake 1280) where a mother in heriting a village granted to her son Parāśarabhatta made a gift of it to the god Ranganātha at Srirangam.

Brothers and their sons as heirs 

725 

Brothers (bhrataraḥ) and brother's sons. Acc. to both Yāj. and Viṣnu, on failure of the parents the brothers succeed and on failure of brothers, brother's sons inherit. There were appa rently conflicting texts, Saṅkha, Manu (IX. 185) and others giving the inheritance to the brothers even before the parents. All these are somehow reconciled and almost all digests from the Mit. downwards are agreed that brothers inherit after the parents. But again a conflict of views ensues. The Mit. says that among brothers, those of full blood inherit in preference to half brothers ( i. e. sons of the same father but sprung from a different mother). It then says that on failure of both kinds of brothers, the inheritance goes to brother's sons; but even here the sons of full brothers are preferred to sons of half brothers. This view of the Mit. is shared by the Dāyabhaga and almost all eininent writers of digests except the author of the V. Mayūkha. The Mit. prefers the full brother to the half brother on the ground that the full brother has particles of the bodies of both the father and the mother of the deceased, while the half brother has only the particles of the father's body (the mother being different). Therefore the full brother is nearer than the half brother. The Dāyabhāga argues 139 that the full brother offers pindas to the same three paternal ancestors and the same three maternal ancestors to whom the deceased was bound to offer piṇdas and is to be preferred to the half brother who offers piṇdas to the three paternal ancestors of the deceased alone (but not to the maternal ancestors of the deceased). This view of spiritual benefit being the governing principle in pre ferring the full brother to the half brother is accepted by Aparārka (p. 745 ), 1398 The reasons of the V. Mayūkha for pre ferring even the full brother's son to the half brother are: the word 'brothers' principally stands for 'brothers of the whole blood' (sodara) and only secondarily for brothers of the half blood. The general rule of Mimārsā 1399 is that the game word is

not to be understood in the same sentence or rule as used in the primary and also in the secondary sense. Just as the word 'mother applies only to the natural mother (and not to the step-mother), so bhrātaraḥ should not include both full and half brothers. The V. Mayūkha is however wrong. As pointed out by the Dāyabhāga, when Yaj. wants to speak of the full brother he employs the words sodara' (Yāj. II. 138) and when he wants to refer to the half brother he employs the word 'anyodarya' or 'anyamūtrja' (Yaj. II. 139). Therefore the word 'bbrātarah' applies to both full and half brothers in the primary sense. There are other smsti texts such as that of the Smṛti-sangraha stating that brothers are of two kinds viz. those of full blood and those of half blood. 1400 

The Sm, 1401 C. II. 300 refutes the view of some that the word 'bhrātaraḥ' in Yāj. is an ekaśeṣa dvandva compound that it means 'brothers and sisters' according to Pān. I. 2. 68' ( bhrāts-putrau svass-duhitsbhyām) and that on failure of brothers sisters inherit. The V. Mayūkha 1402 also does not accept this interpretation of 'bhratarah' advanced by some, since there is no reason why 'bhrātaraḥ' should be taken as an ekaśeṣa of the virūpa kind ( which is restricted only to rare cases) and not of the sarūpa kind. The Balambhatti supports the wider interpretation of " bhrātarah' and at one time the Bombay High Court was inclined to accept this

interpretation. 1403 The above shows that some at least of the medieval and later Hindu jurists were more sympathetic and well disposed to the enlargement of the rights of women, though their views, failed to sooure general acceptance. It has been held that brothers by the same father (though by different mothers) are preferred to brothers by the same mother (though by different fathers ), it being pointed out that "there is no provision in the Mitakṣarā or elsewhere for the sons born of the same mother after her remarriage being treated as brothers of the same womb for the purpose of inheritance so as to be included in the meaning of the word 'bhrātarah' used in the texts."1404 But Nandapandita expressly provides in his Vaijayanti the following order of succession among brothers and sisters of the whole and of the half blood: (1) brothers of the whole blood, (2) sisters of the whole blood, (3) brothers who are sons of the same father, (4) brothers who are sons of the same motber (vide Jolly T. L. L. pp. 208 and 287). Because Manu IX. 217 says that the wealth of a childless man is taken by the mother and that if the mother be dead, the father's mother would take it, the Sm. C. II. p. 299 places the paternal grand mother before the brothers, but it stands almost alone in this and the Mit. observes 1405 that Manu does not lay down the order but only provides that the paternal grand-mother is an heir capable of inheriting. The V. P. (p. 527) expresses its dissatisfaction with this method of the Mit. whereby only Yāj. and Viṣnu are deemed to lay down the order in which heirs

take, while Manu, Saṅkha and others are deemed to be only concerned with declaring the right of certain persons to inherit. 

The V. Mayūkha proposes a special order of inheritance as follows :-(1) full brothers; (2) then full brother's sons ; (3) the gotraja sapiṇdas of whom the first is the paternal grand mother, (4) then the sister, (5) then the paternal grandfather and the half brother at the same time, (6) then the paternal great-grandfather, paternal uncle and the half brother's son together. It should be noted that this conjoint inheritance by heirs of different degrees of ascent and descent which is peculiar to the Mayukha has been regarded by the Bombay High Court as unknown in practice and obsolete. 1406 Therefore it is probable that even in districts governed by the Mayukha the order of heirs after the paternal grandmother and full sister would be half brother, then half sister and then half brother's son and then it will be the same both according to the Mit. and the Mayūkha, 

The Mit, does not expressly mention the sister at all but the Bombay High Court has held her to be a very near heir even where the Mit. is paramount, placing her after the brothers (whether full or half ), brother's sons (whether of the whole blood or half blood ) and paternal grandmother, the difference from the Mayūkha being that under the latter the full sister comes only after the full brothers and full brother's sons and paternal grandmother and before half brothers and half brother's sons. 

One passage of the Mayūkha, being wrongly translated by Borradaile, has led the courts (including the P. C.) to decide that full brothers succeed along with the sons of a deceased full brother wherever the Mayūkba is supreme. The passage of the Mayukha as translated by Borradaile (vide Stokes H. L. Books p. 88, IV. 8. 17) runs "the sons of a brother also, if themselves fatherless, at the time of the paternal uncle's death, provided they are capable of understanding (the use of) property, will divide the father's share with their father's other brothers, after the example among grandsons by different fathers, the allotment of shares jg according to the fathers'".

Misunderstood Mayūkha passage 

729 

The text of the Mayūkha is given in the note below. It is 1407 almost the same as a passage of the Mitākṣarā, which has not been misunderstood. Both passages contemplate a case like this. A dies leaving B, C, D, his brothers, as his nearest heirs, 80 that A's estate vests in interest in B, C, D. Before the estate of A is actually divided by metes and bounds, B dies leaving three sons E, F, G. The last three had no right to the property of A at their uncle A's death because their father B was living at the time (i. e. pitvyamaranakāle jivatpitskataya asanjata-dlanasambandhāh). Yet when the property is later on actually to be divided they ( E, F, G) will take the share which their father B would have taken if the property of A had been divided at the moment of A's death. Here a distinction is drawn between vesting of property (dhanasambandha) and its actual partition. But, in order to entitle nephews to take by actual partition, their father should have survived the deceased. 

This is the real meaning, 

The Privy 1408 Council, following a wrong translation, held that, under the law of the V. Mayūkha, brothers and the sons

But often times this is not so and varying statements of the law are due to individual opinions.

of a brother that died before the propositus ( the brother inherit ance to whom is in question) shared the estate of the latter. This erroneous decision has been persisted in to this day on the principle of stare decisis. The view of the Vaijayanti about the sons of the same woman from different husbands being sapindas of each other has already been noted (p. 727). Govindarāja on Manu DIL 11 says that it is wellknown that children of different fathers but of the same mother are spoken of as brother and sister. Kullūka on Manu III. 11 refers to this view of Govindarāja. 1409 

A question arises whether the distinction between full blood and half blood made by the Mit, in the case of brothers and nephews was to be carried beyond them. Though a Full Bench 1410 of the Bombay High Court held that the dis tinction was not to be carried beyond brothers and nephews. and that paternal uncles of the half blood inherited along with paternal uncles of the full blood, the Privy Council over ruled this decision and held that the preference of the whole blood to the half blood extends to all sapiṇdas of the same degree from the common ancestor (and therefore a paternal uncle of the whole blood excludes one of the half blood ). The Madanapārijāta 1411 p. 674 expressly extends the preference of the whole blood to paternal wholes,

places the mother before the father ( folios 139-140). Following this case it was held in Haridas v. Ranchordas 5 Bom. L. R, 516 that the son of a predeceased brother inherited along with the brothers of the deceased. This rule is not to be carried beyond brothers and brothers' sons. In Kesarial o. Jagubhai 49 Bom. 282 the differring translations of the Mayukha were referred to (at. p. 286), it was held that the principle of stare decisis required that the Privy Council decision should be followed and the estate of a deceased brother was allowed to devolve on the sons of a brother that had died before the deceased along with the surviviog brother.

Compact series of heirs 

731 

It is noteworthy that the Viramitrodaya which generally follows the Mit. invokes the principle of spiritual benefit in preferring the full brother's son to the half brother's son. 1412 

The heirs from the wife to the brother's Bons are spoken of as 'baddhakrama' (lit. whose order is fixed) in the Mit., the V. Mayūkha (p. 143 ) and other works and as 'the compact series (of heirs )' in the case law. For example, in rejecting the view of some that rely on Manu IX, 217 that the father's mother succeeds immediately after the mother, it is said that the heirs from the parents to the brother's son being mentioned in a fixed order (by Yāj.), no place can be found for the father's inother in the fixed series of heirs and that Manu IX. 187 indicates only this that the father's mother is an heir. 1413 The V. Mayūkha relies on the popular maxim that when certain persons are specially invited for a meeting or a dinner they are seated on seats definitely allotted to them but that those who come uninvited are assigned places at the end of the row of those who were specially invited. 1414 

The question ariges whether the brother's son's son inherits immediately after the brother's son and before any other heir. There is a conflict among Sanskrit writers on this point. The Sm. C. II. p. 300, 1415 the Subodhins, the Madanapārijāta (p. 673) say that the compact series ends with the brother's son, while Aparārka, Varadarāja (V. Nir, p. 453 ) and the Vaijayanti of Nandapandita hold that the brother's son's son comes immediate

ly after the brother's son. A Full Bench of the 1416 Bombay High Court holds, basing its decision on the usage of the province, that the compact series ends with the brother's son, while the Privy Council would seem to lend colour to the view that in the Benares school it ends with the brother's son's son. The Dayabhāga (XI. 6.6 p. 208) places the brother's son's son immediately after the brother's son on the ground of the superior efficacy of the pipdas offered by him. 

Gotrajas (lit. 'those born in the same gotra' or agnates ). Yaj. says that on failure of the heirs up to brother's song the gotrajas succeed. Though one's father, brothers and brother's Bons also are really gotrajas, they are expressly assigned cer tain fixed places in the order of heirs and other persons born in the gotra are included in the term gotrajas on the analogy of such an example as 'let the cattle be brought and also the bulls' where the bulls, though really included under 'cattle (gāvaḥ), are separately mentioned in order to emphasize that special attention must be paid to them on account of their in tractable nature. Vide p. 526 note 966 above, Acc. to the Mit. gotrajas are the father's mother ( as the first among them ), then other gapiṇdas and samānodakas. The V. Mayūkha (p. 143 ) also says the same thing and places the father's mother as the first among gotraja sapiṇdas. It may be remarked that Yāj. avoids the word sapiṇda and employs the word gotraja. The Mit. and Mayūkha state that sapiṇdas succeed as heirs and that sapiṇdas are of two kinds, viz. gotrajas ( born in or having the same gotra as the propositus ) and those that are born in (or are of) a different gotra. These latter (viz. bhinnagotra sapindas ) are designated as bandhus by Yaj. Therefore it comes to this that, though Yaj. does not employ the word sapinda, the inheri tance goes after the brother's son to the nearest sapinda. Yāj. knew the word 'sapiṇda' (I 52) and defines the limits of sapiṇda relationship for marriage (in I. 53), from which it follows that he does not use the word sapiṇda in the senge given to the word by Jimõtavāhana. In I. 68 Yaj. mentions both sapiṇda and sagotra (in the matter of niyoga ) and thereby indi cates two things viz. that the words were not synonymous and that sagotra had the same sense as gotraja. 

1416. Vide Appaji v. Mohanlal 54 Bom 564 (F. B.), in which Buddha Singh v. Laltu Singh L. R, 42 I. A, 208 was distinguished on the ground that it was not an express decision on the question whether the. compact series of heirs ended with the brother's son.

Meaning of sapinda in Mann 

733 

Ap. Dh. S. II. 6, 14, % provides 1417 that'on failure of sons the nearest sapinda'(inherits). Manu 1418 IX. 187 is the classi cal text on this point, which appears to mean literally, 'whoever is nearest from among the sapindas, to him the estate (of the deceased) shall belong'. This verse has been variously ex plained by the commentators and digests and variously trans lated by eminent Judges and writers on Hindu Law. The chief difficulty lies in the expression sapiṇdādyah' and the words tasya tasya'. Some take the first as equal to two words 

sapiṇdāt yah' and others as one word 'gapiṇdadyaḥ' (sapiṇda and the like). Some take one ' tasya' (of him) as referring to the deceased and the other to the inheritor; while others take * tasya tasya' as both referring to the inheritor alone, corres ponding to'yaḥ' (one more 'yaḥ' being suppressed for the sake of metre). Though the printed text and most of the commen taries read the half verge of Manu as in the note below there are several digests that read it differently. For example, the Sm. O. II. p. 301 reads it as 'yo yo hyanantaraḥ piṇdāt' and quotes Dhāreśyara's explanation that 'piṇdāt' means 'sapiṇdāt'. Kullūka and the Dāyatattva p. 195 explain 'sapiṇdāt' as * sapindamadhyāt' (from among sapiṇdas ) and this appears to be the best explanation. Br. 1419 (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 verge 62 )

Bühler is not right when he emphatically says: "On philological grounds it seems to me improbable that 'anantaraḥ sapiṇdāt' can mean anything else than 'nearest to the sapinda 'and that this sapiṇda can be anybody else than the deceased". In the first place the singular sapiṇdāt' can be easily interpreted as used in a generic sense (jātāvekavacanam) i, e, as meaning 'sapiṇdebhyaḥ' (from among sapiṇdas). In Ap., Br, and other works wherever inheritance is spoken of, it is the inheritor who is required to be the sapinda or bandhava or sakulya and the deceased is hardly anywhere spoken of as the sapinda of the in heritor but rather "as 'mrta', 'svaryāta ', dbanin' &c.

says, 'when there are several agnates, sakulyas and bandhairs (cognates ), whosoever of them is the nearest shall take the wealth of him that dies without issue', 

The important question is: what is the meaning of the word 'sapiṇda'. The Mitākṣarā and the Dayabhāga propound two different meanings of the word that have been explained at length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and 472-477. Therefore it is not necessary to repeat those explanations. The word 

sapinda ' is employed by Pāṇini (IV. 1. 165) in connection with the technical definition of gotra (Pān. IV. 1. 162 ) given by him. It appears to have been used in the sense of blood rela tionship as stated by the Kāsikā. According to the Mit, the right to inheritance depends upon blood relationship ( connec tion through particles of the same body, ekaśarīrūvayavānvaya) and the preference among those who are blood relations is deter muined by nearness or propinquity (pratyāsatti). According to the Dāyabhāga, sapinda relationships is based on religious efficacy i. e, on the capacity to offer the cake or ball of rice in grāddha and it has evolved a peculiar method of determining preference which will be explained immediately below. That there appears to have been a close connection between taking the woalth of the deceased and offering śrāddha to him may be admitted. But the question is whether a person was deemed to be an heir and entitled to take the estate of the decoased because he offered śrāddha to that person or whether the heirship was originally determined on other grounds and whoever took the estate was saddled with the responsibility of performing śrāddhas for the benefit of the soul of the deceased. It is difficult to give a convincing answer to this. It appears, however, that ancient sūtras do not emphasize the religious efficacy of pindas as the determining principle in heirship. Ap., Manu, Br. (particular ly the first and last ) speak only of nearness (which more naturally means 'nearness of blood '). Yaj. omits the word sapiṇda altogether in mentioning heirs. Manu IX. 142 states that pipda follows the gotra and riktha (wealth). Vispu Dh. 8. XV.40 declares,' whoever inherits the estate (of the deceased) has to offer piṇda to him'. This rule is emphasized even by those works (like V. Mayūkha) 1420 that make blood relationship

the test of heirship by saying that whoever even including the king (who takes by escheat on failure of all heirs ) that takes the estate of the deceased must perform or arrange for the performance of the funeral ceremonies of the deceased up to 10 days after death and the śrāddhas, as said by the Braluna purāṇa 220. 79 (tadabhāve ca nrpatih kārayettvakutunbināmi tajjātiyair-naraiḥ samyak-dāhādyāḥ sakalāh kriyāḥ ). The Mit. view is upheld by V. R., V. C., Par. M., Madanapārijāta, Saras. vativilāga, V. Mayūkha, Bālambhaçṭi and many other works. The theory of the Dayabhāga is propounded by only a few medieval works and writers like Aparārka (quoted above on p. 725), Raghunandana, Nanda pandita. The Viramitrodaya generally follows the Mit, but in certain cases it relies on or refers to the principle of religious efficaoy in preferring one heir to another, as for example, in preferring the full brother to the step-brother (compare note 1397 and V. P. p. 528) or in preferring tlırce male descendants to the widow. It is therefore that the Privy Council remark, 1421 'now it is absolutely clear that under the Mitā kṣarā while the right of inheritance arises from blood relationship or community of blood, in judging of the nearness of blood relation ship or propinquity among the gotrajas the test to be applied to discover the preferential heir is the capacity to offer "oblations'. Its position is peculiar. 1422 It says that the capacity to offer piṇdas is not the governing principle as to heirship, but it is only useful in finding out the preferential heir among gotrajax. 

Viṣnu quoted by the Mit. (not found in the printed Dharmasūtra) prescribes : 'If there be no son or grandson left for continuing the line, the daughter's sons shall take the wealth, for in regard to the obsequies of ancestors daughter's sons are regarded as son's sons'. This is in line with Manu IX. 136 ( cited above on p. 720 ) which says that the daughter's son should offer the pinda and take the wealth. Therofore it appears that Manu, Viṣnu and others relied upon the capacity for the offering of pinda as the reason for being entitled as heir, but that this idea was vague and not elaborated in any way. The idea that blood relationship settled the right to inheritance is implicit in the order of heirs in Yāj. Yaj. ( II. 127 ) in speaking of the kṣetraja son says that he inherite the wealth of both ( the

begetter and the husband of the wife on whom he is begotten) and offers pinda to both, He does not state that because he offers pinda to both he inherits the wealth. So this verse also favours the view that offering of pinda was a duty laid up on him who took the wealth (except in the case of male issue ). Hence it appears that the theory of the Mit. also has a very respectable antiquity and further it has been followed by most medieval writers throughout India ( except in Bengal). 

The argument of the Dayabhāga ( which was propounded before it by a writer probably named Udyota 1423) that the taking of a deceased person's estate depends upon the spiritual benefit conferred on him is briefly as follows. It relies princip ally on Baud. Dh, S. and Mapu. In the section on the partition of wealth ( which begins from IX. 103 ) Manu (IX. 137) declares the super-eminent spiritual benefits conferred by the son, grandson and great-grandson; further (in IX. 106 ) Manu states that the son gets all wealth from his father because he frees the latter from debt, that ( in IX. 139 ) the daughter's son also is spoken of as saying the grandfather in the next world and as therefore entitled to the grandfather's wealth, that the verse immediately preceding Manu IX. 187 ( declaring that the nearest amongst sapiṇdas inherits ) speaks of the offering of piṇda to three ancestors; and since it is reasonable to prosume that the blind and the like are excluded from inheritance (Manu IX. 201 ) because they are incapable of performing religious rites, it follows that Manu and others regarded the taking of wealth as dependent on the conferring of spiritual benefit. This point of view the Dayabhāga emphasizes at every step. It 1424 says: "There are two purposes for which wealth is acquired, viz. for worldly enjoyment and for the unseen or spiritual benefit derived from making gifts and the like ; but when the acquirer is dead, he cannot have enjoyment of the wealth and the only purpose that remains is the unseen purpose or benefit. It is therefore that Br. says, 'from the wealth inherited, the inheritor should carefully set apart half for the benefit of the deceased for defraying the expenses of the

monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas". The subject of Grāddhas will be dealt with in another volume. But here it is necessary to say a few words for making the position of the Dayabhāga clear. Among the several kinds of sraddhas two deserve notice, viz. Ekoddiṣta and Pārvana. 1425 The first (ekoddi ṣta ) is performed for the benefit of a single deceased person. There are sixteen such śrāddhas performed for the benefit of the deceased during the course of one year after his death or on the 11th day of death. And every year on the anniversary of death an ekoddista śrāddha may be performed for a deceased person. The pārvaṇa śrāddha is performed on certain specified days, such as the amāvāsyā of a month, or particularly in the dark half or on the amāvāsyā of Bhadrapada or on a sankrānti. In this srāddha the three deceased paternal ancestors of the performer are principally invoked and the three deceased paternal ancestors of his mother are also invoked but their invocation is secondary and is dependent on the principal invocation. There is one more word that must be explained here viz. sapindana or sapindikarana. This is a grāddha rite performed one year after the death of a person or on the 12th day from his death. By this grāddha the person recently deceased ceases to be a preta ( a departed spirit) and is elevated to the rank of pitss (Manes). The widow and daughter can perform only the ekoddista śrāddha, while sons, grandsong and great-grandsons can perform the pārvaṇa śrāddha also. The Dayabhāga refers ( XI. 1. 34 p. 162 ) to the fact that the three male descendants, by performing the pārvana-sraddha, confer great spiritual benefit on the owner (compare note 1342 above ). Elsewhere ( XI. 7. 17 p. 211) it designates the paryaṇa as 'traipuruṣika'(i. e. performed for the benefit of three ancestors).

a widow by leading a chaste life, by offering water mixed with sesame every day to her deceased husband, by making gifts and observing fasts saves himself and her husband in the next world. It adds that if the widow misbehaves she makes her husband fall, as husband and wife share in the fruits of each other's good and evil deeds. Therefore the widow takes her husband's wealth for his benefit. Bphan-Manu (4. by the Dayabhaga XI. 1. 7 and by the Mit. ) declares that a sonless chaste widow should offer pinda to her husband and take his entire estate. Similarly Prajapati (cited above on p. 709 and quoted by even the V. Mayūkha and other works of the Mitakṣarā school) requires the widow who inherits all the movable and im. movable property of her deceased husband to perform the monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas of her husband. 1427 Similarly the Dayabhāga allows the unmarried daughter or a married daughter having a son (or who is likely to have a son) to inherit because her son will offer pinda to the owner who will be the maternal grand-father. It prefers the daughter's son 1428 as an heir even to the father because the former offers a pinda to the owner himself, while the father offers pindas to two of the three paternal ancestors to whom the owner would have been bound to offer piṇdas. The D. B. winds up by saying 1439 that the order of inheritors must be followed in such a way that the wealth of the deceased may be most beneficial to the soul of) the deceased. In certain respects the D. B. does not strictly and logically follow its own theory but is compelled to twist it by reason of the places assigned by special

texts to certain heirs. 1430 For example, the order of heirs according to the D. B. is ; son, grandson and great grandson ; widow ; daughter; daughter's son: father; mother; full brother ; half brother; full brother's son; half brother's son. But the persons entitled to perform the śrāddha of the deceased in order are somewhat different. In fact the order of sucoession does not strictly follow in any school the order of those that are called srāddhādhilārins. The order of those who are entitled to offer śrāddha to a deceased separated male ( śrāddhūdhikārin) given in most works is as followe; son ( aurasa or adopted ); grand son; great-grandson; widow; married daughter; unmarried daughter who has succeeded to the doceased's wealth; daughter's son who succeeds to the wealth; full brother; half brother (son of a different mother); full brother's son; half brother's son; father ; mother; daughter-in-law; full sister; half sister; full sister's son; half sister's son; paternal uncle; paternal uncle's son; other gotraja sapindas ; sodaka; any gotraja ; cognates such as maternal grandfather, maternal uncle, maternal uncle's son (i. e. the bandhus of the three kinds in order); pupil; son-in-law ; father-in-law; friend; any brāhmaṇa who takes a brahmana's wealth or king who takes by escheat. Vide Nirnayasindhu III uttarardha pp.382-386, Dharmasindhu III uttarardha pp. 368,369, Sraddhaviveka p. 48. If the principle of the capacity to offer or of the offering of pindas regulating the right to succeed is to be strictly and logically followed, there is no reason why the mother or the paternal grandmother should succeed immediate ly after the father or the paternal grandfather respectively. Her recognition in the D. B. school is due to the fact she is expressly mentioned in Manu as an heir. Similarly in the rules about the succession to re-united copardeners, the school of D. B. gives preference to re-united co-parcenors and does not apply the theory of spiritual benefit. Further the Dāyatattva says that all that is required is the capacity 

1430. Vide Akshaya Chandra v. Haridas 35 Cal. 721 at p. 726 and Nalinaksha v. Rajanikanta 58 Cal. 1392 for the propositions that the doctrina of spiritual benefit cannot be applied consistently in all cases such as the succession of females to males, the succession of samanodakas &c. and that in cases not contemplated by Jimūtavābana or his followers in the Bengal school, the principle of propiaquity and of natural love and affection should be followed. The Dāyatattva p. 195 after quoting Br. cited above observes that both the superiority of pindas offered and nearness of line are to be considered la inheritance, 'foregrappear EPATUTT तम्पेन च धनेपधिकारी,

to receive pinda or the capacity to participate in the pipdas offered by others and not the actual offering of pindas. For example, if a man performs śrāddha for his ancestors, then dies, but no one performs his sapipdana and therefore he does not participate in the pindas given to his ancestors, still his wealth will be inherited on the principle of religious efficacy. 1431 Owing to considerations of space it is not possible to go into great detail about the several proposi tions established in relation to the theory of religious benefit as the determining factor in matters of inheritance. But the following propositions may be set out in one place: 

(1) Benefits are conferred on the deceased by means of the ekoddiṣta or the pārvanu śrāddha. The capacity to perform the pārvana śrāddha is not the sole ground on which rests the right to inheritance to a man. Therefore the widow, the daughter and the pupil were recognized as heirs though they perform only the ekoddista śrāddha. But those who are competent to perferm the pārvana śrāddha have a preferable claim to those who are entitled to perform only the ekoddiṣta śrāddha. There fore the male issue of a deceased person are preferred to a widow or daughter. 

(2) Spiritual benefit is conferred on a man by presenting piṇda directly to him or by offering pinda to one or more of his paternal ancestors to whom he presents piṇdas during his own life time and with whom he participates in pindas offered after his death by others or by offering a pinda to one or more of his maternal ancestors ( mother's father, mother's father's father and the latter's father) to whom he was bound to offer pindas during his life (but with whom he does not participate in the piṇda offered to them 1432 ). 

(3) The pinda offered to a man himself directly is of greater efficacy than the piṇda offered to a paternal ancestor in which he participates after his own death as one of the Manos. There fore the son, grandson or great-grandson is preferred to every one else. The brother offers a piṇda to the father and two more

paternal ancestors of the deceased in which he (the deceased owner) only participates after his death. Therefore the brother is postponed to the son or daughter's son (who offers a pinda directly to the deceased himself as his maternal grandfather). 

(4) The pindas offered to paternal anoestors have greater efficacy than those offered to maternal ancestors (hence a brother's son is preferred to a sister's son because the former offers pindas to his own and the owner's paternal anoestors, while the latter offers piṇdas to his maternal ancestors who are the paternal ancestors of the owner). 

(5) The pinda offered to the owner's father is of greater efficacy than that offered to the paternal grandfather or great grandfather. Therefore a brother's son or grandson is preferred to a paternal uncle. 1433 Hence it should follow that all agnatic and cognatio descendants of the father of the deceased would be preferred to any descendant of the paternal grandfather or great. grandfather. 

(6) Where the number of pindas offered by two claimants is the same, he who offers a pinda to the nearer ancestor is to be preferred. 

The Dayabhāga, strarting with Baud, Dh. S. (I, 5. 113 ff), Manu (IX. 186-187) and the Matsyapurāpa elaborates its own definition in the following 1434 way. A man's son and a daughter are both born in the family. The daughter's son springs from the family of his maternal grandfather but he belongs to another gotra (viz, his own father's gotra); similarly, a man's sister (i. e. father's daughter) is born in his family but her son, though mediately sprung from the deceased owner's family, belongs to another gotra (viz. that of the sister's husband ): the same is true of a father's sister's son and the paternal grand father's sister's son. A sister's son offers a pinda to the father

of the deceased, as the owner's father is the former's maternal grandfather and therefore he is connected as sapiṇda with the owner. A father's sister's son offers a piṇda to the paternal grand father of the owner, who ( paternal grandfather ) is the maternal grandfather of the father's sister's son. A maternal uncle is not sprung even mediately from the family of the owner, but he offers a piṇda to his own father who is the maternal grandfather of the deceased owner. Therefore the maternal uncle or his son or son's son being connected with a pinda that is offered to the maternal grandfather or maternal great-grandfather respectively of the deceased owner is a sapiada of the deceased owner. A maternal aunt's son also offers a piṇda to his mother's father, who is also the owner's mother's father and so the maternal aunt's son is a sapiṇda of the owner. The pindas offered to the maternal ancestors by him are inferior and secondary. Further, one's own mother, the father's mother, father's father's inother were associated with their respective husbands as to the pindas offered to the male ancestors and the same holds good about the wives of the maternal ancestors also. 1435 

The result of this way of defining a sapiṇda is to obliterate the distinction between a gotraja and a bundhu. Yāj. ( 11. 136 ) expressly says that a bandhu can suoceed only on failure of all gotrajas and so according to him a bandhu is one who is not a gotraja. The Dāyabhāga brings in the sister's son immediately after the the brother's son's son and before the paternal grand father (i, e. even before a near agnatio ancestor ) who is literally a gotraja, while the sister's son is literally not a gotraja. When the Dayabhaga designates one's sister's son as sprung from the kula of the owner though not of the same gotra, he does violence to popular usage prevalent throughout India. An ordinary person in India hardly ever says that his sister's son or father's sister's son is born in his own kula. The Dayabhāga only quibbles over the word 'gotraja' in Yaj. which it reads in the singular (gotrajab) and not in the plural (gotrajāḥ) as the Mit. does. Under the Mit. the sister's son is only a bandhu and cannot succeed before & paternal uncle or his son or a paternal grand-uncle or any other gotraja. The Dayabhāga thus gives the go-by to the text of Yāj. and shuffles in several

cognates as very near heirs. The D. B. regards Manu IX. 186– 187 as the crucial text and Yāj. 11. 135-36 as only secondary. 

The following diagrams will illustrate the working of the theory of religious efficacy. A person is a sapiṇda of those to whom he is bound to offer a pinda while he is alive, of those who on his death are bound to offer pinda to him (viz. his three male descendants, his daughter's son, his son's daughter's son and his son's son's daughter's son) and of those who are bound to offer a piṇda to the ancestors to whom he is bound to offer a pinda viz. to his three paternal ancestors and his three maternal ancestors and all of these are his sapiṇdas. The last of these three groups has four sub-groups :--sub-group No. 1 comprises those who offer piṇdas to their own paternal ancestors who are also the paternal ancestors of the owner: sub-group II contains those who offer pindas to their three maternal ancestors who are all or some of them the paternal ancestors of the owner, to whom he was bound to offer a pipda; sub-group II comprises those who offer piṇdas to their paternal ancestors all or some of whom are the maternal ancestors of the owner; sub-group IV exhibits those who offer pindas to their own maternal ancestors who are also the maternal ancestors of the owner. Each of these sub-groups contains 9 persons (as the minimum ) who are all shown in thick type. If the owner has several brothers, sisters, uncles and aunts &c. the number of possible sapindas will be much larger. All heirs in the three sub-groups II-IV will be bandhus according to the Mitaksarā and will be post poned to gotrajas under the Mitakṣarā. It should be noticed that Jimūtavābana brought in the father's daughter's son immediately after the father's great-grandson, the paternal grandfather's daughter's son after the paternal grandfather's great-grandson and the paternal great-grandfather's daughter's son immediately after that ancestor's great-grandson on the analogy of the rights of the owner's daughter's son and on the basis of Manu IX. 139 that the dauhitra ( daughter's gon)-saves an ancestor in the next world just as a son's son does. 1436

those that are expressly named as heirs by special texts ), since they are not born or (even mediately ) sprung from the family of the owner, as the sister's son or the father's sister's bon that is held by it to be so sprung, that the word "bandhu' is employed by Yāj. to include a maternal uncle and the like among heritable sapiṇdas, since they are not sprung even mediately from the kula of the owner and are also not of the same gotra, that the maternal unole and the like come in only after all descendants in the lines of the paternal ancestors inclusive of the great-grandfather up to the latter's daughter's son are exhausted, 1438 and that Manu had not to enter into these details as its two verses (IX. 186-187) were quite enough to lead to all that has been elaborated by the D. B. about the working of the theory of religious efficacy. 

It will have been noticed that no female except the five expressly mentioned can inherit under the Dāyabhāga scheme and the result is that a man's own son's daughter or daughter's daughter does not take as heir, whereas a distant:relative like the father's father's sister's son takes it. The same is also the case even under the Mitākṣarī in the whole of India (except in Bombay and to some extent in Madras for which see a little later on). 

A man offers only the leayings or remnants of the piṇdas that stick to his hand ( when offering piṇdas to his three paternal ancestors) and that ( leavings) are cast on kusa grass to three paternal ancestors above the paternal great-grandfather (Manu III. 216). So also the three male descendants beyond the great-grandson offer the leavings (called pindalepa ) to the owner; these three remote paternal ancestors and the three remote malo descendants (spoken of as vibhaktadāyāda in Baud. Dh. $. I. 5. 114) are designated sakulya by Baud., and 

1438. Vide Kailasha Chandra v. Karuna Nath 18 C. W. N. 477 where the above passages are considered at length and it is held that the paternal grand-uncle's daughter's son (though pot expressly mentioned by the D. B.) is entitled to preference over the waternal uncle (who is ex pressly mentioned as an heir and a sapiṇda by D. B.), since the former offers a pipda to the paternal great-grandfatber of the owner to whom the owner was bound to offer a pinda in which the owner participates after his owa death, while the latter offers a piada to the maternal grandfather of the owner to whom the owner was bound to offer a pinda in which, however, the owner did not participate after his death.

Meaning of sakulya 

747 

the D. B.1439 (XI. 1. 38). According to D. B. sakulyas succeed after all sapipdas are exhausted. Just as a man participates after his death in the pindas offered to his paternal ancestors 80 he would participate in the leavings also offered to his paternal ancestors from the 4th to 6th by their descendants (from 4th to 6th). The D. B. remarks that this difference between sapiṇdas and sakulyas is made only in the matter of inheritance. But in the matter of the periods of mourning both the sapiṇdas ( strictly so called in the section on inherit ance ) and the sakulyas are designated sapipdas by Manu (V. 60) and by the Markandeya-purana ( 28. 4).1440 According to Manu IX. 187 salculyas succeed on failure of sapindas, while Viṣnu Dh. 8. ( XVII. 9-11) prescribes 1441 that on failure of bandhus, sakulyas succeed. It appears that Viṣnu employs the word bandhu in the sense of sapinda. Nar.(dayabhaga,51) states that on failure of daughters and sakulyas, bāndhavas and persons of the same caste succeed. Here it appears that sakulya and bandhava are employed in the sense of gotraja and bāndhava as done in Yaj. The Balambhatti says that gotraja and sakulya are synonymous. The Dāyabhāga appears to be some what inconsistent in its references to sakulyas. In XI. 6. 15 and 23 it includes samāpodakas among sakulyas, while in XI. 6. 21-22 it defines sakulya as stated above. The Mit, on the other hand comprehends the sakulyas of the D. B. (as defined in XI.6.21) under its gotraja sapindas.

It para phrases the word gotraja ( born in the gotra ) as samānagotra (having the same gotra ) and then proceeds, 'on failure of the father's line ( santāna) the heirs are the paternal grandmother, the paternal grandfather, the paternal uncles and their sons in order; on failure of the paternal grandfather's line the paternal great-grandmother, the paternal great-grandfather, his sons and son's sons inherit. In this manner must be understood the succession of sapindas belonging to the same gotra ( as the deceased) up to the 7th degree'. According to the Mit, sapiṇda relationship extends up to the 7th degree ( reckoned from and inolusive of the owner). Therefore the owner's sapiṇdas for purposes of inheritance according to the Mit. are the owner's (1) 6 male descendants in the male line, (2) 6 male ascendants in the male line and the wives of the first three of them (that are expressly so declared, viz. mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother) and probably the wives of the next three also; (3) the six male descendants of each of his six male ascendants in the collateral male lines. Besides, a man's wife and daughter are treated as his sapiṇdas and the daughter's son, though a bhinnagotra sapinda, is placed high among the gotraja sapiṇda heirs. 

Even under the Mitākṣard in the whole of India (except in the Bombay and Madras schools ), no wonien succeed as gotraja sapiṇdas (except five expressly named and cited above on p. 713 ). In Bombay the sister (full or half) is brought in as a gotraja by the V. Mayūkha ( though the Mitakṣarā is entirely silent) and placed by it immediately after the paternal grandmother. It relies on the general words of Manu IX. 187 and of Bf. ( quoted above on p.733 ) that to the nearest person in blood the inheritance goes and then proceeds: 1442 She is also a gotraja as being born in the gotra in which her brother (the deceased owner) was born. She is, however, not a sagotra (of the deceased brother), but being a sagotra is not mentioned here (in Yaj.) as the condition that leads on to the taking of the wealth of the deceased'. Here the V. Mayūkha plays upon the word gotraja and takes its literal meaning. But that is a specious argument. The

Sister as a gotraja heir

widow and mother are not gotrajas (in this sense of being born in the gotra) but on marriage they enter the gotra of their husbands and become sagotra. Further, on the same reasoning, a son's daughter, brother's daughter, father's sister and other women born in the family of the deceased will become his gotrajas (though not sagotras because on marriage they pass into the gotra of their husbands). But these other women are not expressly recognised even by the V, Mayukha as gotrajas. Even though she was not mentioned in the Mit. the sister has been recognised as a gotraja sapiṇda by the Bombay High Court in parts of the Bombay Presidency where the Mit. is the paramount authority. The order of heirs under the Mit, would be as follows:-Full brother, half brother, full brother's son, half brother's son, paternal grandmother, sister (full being preferred to half), paternal grandfather. According to the V, Mayūkha the order is slightly different, viz. full brothers along with sons of full brothers that are dead, full brother's son, grandmother, full sister, halfbrother, halfsister, paternal grandfather. The unmarried sister had been recognized as entitled to a share when brotherg came to a partition and they had to provide for her marriage expenses. Vide above pp. 619-620 and Nār. 1443 ( dāyabhāga, 13), Viṣnu Dh, S. 18, 35, Manu IX. 118, Yaj. II. 124. In Madras the sister had been recognized as a bandhu. The Legislature has intervened and laid down ( Hindu Law of Inheritance Amend mont Act II of 1929 ) that in territories governed by the law of the Mitakṣarā and in respect of the property of males not held in coparcenary and not disposed by will, a son's daughter, daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son shall be entitled to rank as heirs in the order specified in the Act next after a father's father and before a father's brother. The first three of these were before this Act not at all recognized as heirs in the whole of India except in Bombay (where the sister was recog nised as a gotraja sapiṇda and the first two as bandhus ) and except in Madras ( where the first three were recognized only as bandhus ). The sister's son was given a very high place as a sapiṇda under the Dayabhāga and was treated as a bandhu elsewhere in India. This enaótment does not affect the Daya bhaga scheme and so the three females mentioned in the Aot are not heirs even now under the Dayabhaga. The sister's place as settled by Bombay decisions is after the paternal

grandmother and before the paternal grandfather, while the above Act places her after the paternal grandfather. In Bai Mahalaxmi v. The Deputy Nazir 45 Bom. L. R. 434 it has for this reason been held that the Act does not apply to the Bombay Province. If it be held that the Act does apply to Bombay (except as to the sister), then the same Act will have to be deemed to be laying down two different orders of succession as to the same four heirs in different provinces, which, to say the least, is not a reasonable or desirable way of interpreting statutes (just as in the case of texts ). 

Some difficulty is caused by the use of the word santāna in the Mit, as regards the father's, grandfather's and great-grand father's line. It has been seen above (p. 731 ) that the compact series ends with the brother's son (father's son's son i. e. after two descendants of the father) according to the Bombay High Court, while elsewhere in India it is supposed to end with the brother's son's son ( i. e. after three descendants of the father ). The Mit. expressly mentions only two descendants in the grand father's and great-grandfather's line. The general rule is that Bapiṇda relationship extends to six descendants of each line (excluding the man or ancestor from whom the counting is made ). The further general rule gathered from the meagre words of the Mit. is that the nearer line excludes the more remote (eg, the grandfather, his son and grandson are express ly mentioned by the Mit, as taking before the great-grand father, his son and grandson). The question is whether the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th descendants of a nearer line would exclude even the 1st or 2nd descendant of a remoter line e. g. whether the great-grandson of the grandfather would take before the son or grandson of the great-grand-father or whether the 6th descendant of the grandfather would take before the son of the great-grandfather. There were three views 1444 on this point. 

1444. Vide Buddha Singh v. Læltu Singh L. R. 42 1. A, 208 pp. 220-24 · for the three views and their expounders. The P. C. overruled the first view and held (p. 227) that the descendants in each ascendlag line up to the fixed limit should be exhausted at any rate to the third degree before making tbe ascent to the next llue in order of succession. m pentru curata unaou n g Portretfag an Art rograma da guarratifuntovauTiT.

Three views about gotraja succession 

751 

The first view, relying upon certain words of the Sm. O., held that after two descents in each line, one should ascend into a remoter line and after the two descendants of that line are exhausted, one should revert to the 3rd to 6th descendants of a nearer line. The 2nd view was that in each line three genera tions were to be first exhausted, because the word putra in several places in the Mit. includes the three male descendants. The 3rd view 1445 was that in each line six descendants were to be exhausted before ascending to the next remoter line ( 48 sapinda relationship extended to six degrees ). 

Another question is whether the widows of agnatic relations (such as the son's widow, brother's widow, step-mother or paternal uncle's widow) are included in the term 'gotrajāḥ' for purposes of inheritance. Under the Dāyabhāga, as well as under the Mitākṣarī throughout India (except in the Bombay School), the widows of gotraja sapiṇdas are not heirs at all, since according to almost all writers women do not inherit except when expressly mentioned by texts. In the Bombay School the position is different. According to both the Mit. and the Mayūkha, wives enter by marriage the gotra of their husbands and become sapindas of their husbands. The Balambhatti declared the son's widow to be an heir even before the paternal grandmother and includes females also in the word gotrajāḥ. When gotraja was rendered as samānagotra, the term became wide enough not only to include those born in the gotra but even those who entered the gotra by marriage. Besides, it was argued that if the paternal grandmother or. paternal great-grandmother succeeded as a gotraja there was no reason why other widows of other gotrajas should not succeed. From the earliest days of British rule the gotraja sapindas (such as the son's, brother's, paternal uncle's widows) have been recognized as heirs in the Bombay Presidency. They take only a limited estate like the owner's widow 'or mother or 

1445. The third view was propounded by Telang J. in Rachava v, Kalingappa 16 Bom, 716,' which is referred to by the P. C. in 42 I. A, 208. at pp. 220 and 226. The P. C. do not dissent from Telang J. but do not expressly approve of his views as it was not necessary to do so in that case, where the question was whether the great-grandson of the grandfather of the deceased was to be preferred to the grandson of the great-grandfather and it was beld by the P, C, that he was to be preferred. The 2nd view appears to be supported by the words of Aparārka p. 745 & TT NYT स्तत्पौत्र इति पितुसन्तती प्रपा प्रत्यासमाः सपिण्याः । एवं पितामहसन्तती प्रपितामहसन्तती च। एषामभावे पित्रादित्रयस्प ये प्रपौत्रास्तेषां पुत्रादित्रयं सापिण्डवाबनवाएकम् ।।752

paternal grandmother. They are recognized rather on the ground of positive acceptance and usage' by the Privy Council than on the ground of any texts 1446 They occupy the same place as their husbands, succeed after the compact serios, the sister and half-sister and only after all the male gotraja sapiṇdas (up to the 7th degree inclusive of the ancestor ) properly belonging to the line to which their husbands belonged; 0. g. the son's widow would succeed before the brother's son's 1447 son, the brother's widow or step-mother would succeed after all the six male descendants of the husband's father, but before the father's father, paternal uncle or his son &c. These widows of gotraja sapiṇdas succeed before any bandhu. Since Act XVIII of 1937 a man's own widow, his predeceased son's widow and the widow of a predeceased son's predeceased son succeed along with his son or sons throughout India. 

Samanodakas. According to the Mit. gotrajas are either sapiṇdas or Bamā nodakas. The word 'samanodaka' has a technical meaning. Aco. to Manu V.60, 'the sapinda relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relationship of samānodaka148 ends when birth ( in the family) and name are no longer known'. This ocours in the chapter on impurity. The Mit. declares that the samānodakas comprise males seven generations beyond the gapiṇdas or all males (beyond sapipdas ) whose birth (in the same family as that of the deceased) and name are known. It quotes a text of Bphan-Manu, 'the sapinda relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relation of

samānodaka ceases after the 14th; according to some it extends as far as the memory of name and family (or birth) reach; the gotra is said to extend up to that'. The samanodakas comprise the 7 ascendants of a person after the great-grand father's great-grandfather, the 13 descendants of these seven ascendants, the 7 descendants after the 6th descendant of his 6 male ancestors from his own father; and descendants of himself from the 7th to the 13th. The Privy Council have ruled 149 in a recent case that, according to the Mitākṣarā school, samānodaka relationship does not extend beyond the 14th degree (from and inclusive of the common ancestor of the claimant and the propositus). 

The word 'samānodaka' literally means ' those who offer to or receive water from the same person'. The word is employed by Vas. 1450 17. 79. But in the law of inheritance it has a technical meaning as stated above.

A. p. 139 where it was said that in the event of a conflict between the ancient text writers and the commentators the opinion of the latter prevails in the provinces where their authority is recogaized on the ground that the commentators only voiced the usage of the time and of the country in which they lived. The case of Bai Devkoro v. Amritram 10 Bom, 372 where the word samānodaka was interpreted to include any agnate without any limit of degree was not over ruled but was distinguished on the ground that it was governed by the law of the Vyavahāra-mayūkba which quotes only Manu V. 60 and does not quote Brhan-Manu.

1451. The word "bandhu' is a very ancient one and has been used in various senses throughout the ages. In Rg. I. 113. 2 Night and Dawn (Uṣas) are called samānabandhū ( bound together or having a common relative). In Rg. I. 154. 5 (urukramasya sa hi bandhur-itthā ) the word appears ta be used in the sense of 'friend' lo Rg. I, 164, 33 Dābhi' and 'bandhy' are employed one after another. The sage Vasistha tells Asvins (Rg. VII. 72.2) that their mutual friendship is ancestral and their relation is common (yuvorhi naḥ sakhyā pitryāni samāno bandhuruta tasya vittam ). Vide also Rg. V. 73. 4, VIII. 21. 4, VIII. 100. 6.

Mayūkha and all other authorities except those of the Dayabhāga school only on failure of samānodakas (or sodakas). It will have been noticed from the discussion above that gotrajas, whether sapiṇdas and samā nodakas, are all agnates (and in some cases their wives) i. e, persons related to the deceased by unbroken male descent. The bandhus are persons related to the deceased through one or more females. The basic texts on the inherit ance of bandhus are three verses attributed to Vrddha-Satātapa

IV. 22 (asnie ramasvāsme te bandhuḥ )' the poet prays that the god may find delight in them and find in them his bandhu, Among sūtras Gaut. IV. 3 and Vārāhagṛhya 9 speak of pitbandhus - aod mātrbandbus (persons related through the fatber and mother). In Yaj. the word bandhu or bandhava occurs many times and bas at least three senses viz, relative in general (in I. 82, 108, 113, 116, 220 ; II. 144, 280 ; III. 11, 239), agnate (II. 294), cogaate (II, 135, 149, 264). Manu IX. 158 and XII, 79 employ the word bandhu in the sense of relative in general. The Ap. Dh, S. 1. 7. 21. 8 and II. 5. 11. 16 and Gaut. 14. 18 employ the word 'yonisambandha' for persons connected through a female. On the other band Panini V. 3. 23 (rto vidyāyonisambandhebbyah) appears to em. ploy the word in a general sense viz. blood relation' (whether paternal or materjal). Another word frequently used from Vedic times is 'jñāti' which generally means 'agnate' or ' relative'. Vide Rg. X, 66. 14, X. 117. 9. In the Atharvaveda IV. 5. 6 a man desirous of a clandestine intercourse with a wooran prays 'svāpantvasyai jnātayaḥ svaptvayam-abhito janah'. In I. 1. 35 Pānini appears to use the word jāāti in the sense of agnates FAIT fanature. Io Gaut. II. 43, Ap. Dh. S, I. 3. 10.3 jñāti' occurs and is explained by Haradatta as agaatic relations. In Manu III. 31 (inātibhyo dravinam dattva) jñati appears to mean paternal relations. In Manu III, 264, IV. 179, Yāj. II, 149 jñāti is distinguished from bandhava or bandhu and so means 'agaates', Two other words are 'sajāta' and 'sanābbi', The first occurs in the Tai. S. I. 6. 2. 1 and I. 6. 10. i (ugrohan sajāteṣu bhayāsam) and in the Atharvaveda I. 9. 3, III. 8. 2. VI. 5. 2 and moans *agnates or kidsmen'. The word sanābbi occurs in Rg.

Three verses on bandhus

or Baudhāyana. They may be translated as follows: The sons of one's father's sister, the sons of one's mother's sister and the sons of one's maternal uncle these are to be known as at mabandhus ( one's own bandhus); the sons of one's father's father's sister, the sons of one's father's mother's sister, the son's of one's father's maternal uncle--these are to be known as one's pitsbandhus (father's bandhus ); the sons of one's mother's father's sister, the sons of one's mother's mother's sister, the sons of one's mother's maternal uncle these are to be known as the mālfbandhus mother's bandhus ). 1452 The Mit. states on this toxt that bandhus are of three kinds viz, ātma bandhus, pitrbandhus and mātsbandhus and that atmabandhus succeed before pitsbandhus on account of their greater propin quity to the deceased and pitrbandhus succeed before the mātsbandhus. 1453 The treatment of the rights of bandhus in the Mit. and other commentaries and digests is very meagre. This has led in modern times to a bewildering mass of case law on the inheritance of bandhus. 

The first question is whether the enumeration of bandhus in the verses quoted is exhaustive or only illustrative. The V. P. expressly 1454 states that if the enumeration be held to be exhaustive absurd results would follow. For example, a maternal uncle's son is expressly named as an ātmabandhu in the verses quoted above, but his father (the maternal uncle ), being not mentioned, would on that hypothesis be excluded. Therefore it was held by the Privy Council in a very early case 1455 that the enumeration of bandhus is only illustrative, that the maternal uncle though not mentioned is a nearer

bandhu and would succeed in preference to his own son who is expressly mentioned. In Balasubrahmanya v. Subbayya 65 L A, 93 it was held that under the Mitākṣarā the principle of proximity of blood relationship applies to the succession of bandhus, that in determining which of two ātmabandhus is entit led to succeed nearness of degree and not religious efficacy is the proper test to apply, that when the atmabandhus are equal in degree the test of religious efficacy may be applied to determine preference and that the maternal uncle of the deceased is entitled to preference over the deceased's father's half sister's son. This was followed in Virangauda v. Yellappa I. L. R. (1943) Bom. 259 (F. B.) where the mother's brother of the deceased was preferred to the father's sister's son. So also the mother's father would be a bandhu, It is strange that the deceased's own descendants through a female or the deceased's father's descendants through a female such as the son's daughter's son, daughter's son's son, daughter's daughter's son, sister's son or sister's daughter's son, are not mentioned in any authoritative commentaries or digests as his bandhus. Further, the bandhus enumerated in the three verses do not go beyond the 4th degree from the common ancestor. But bandhu relationship extends up to five degrees at least. There is an ancient instance of the sister's daughter's son having succeeded to a Buddhist bhikṣu in Cambodia ( in sake 586 ). This would be so only according to the principles of the Mit. Vide Indian Cultural Influence in Cambodia'p. 55 by Dr. Bijan Raj Chatterji (Cal. 1928). All the above (such as the son's daughter's son) have been recognized by the Indian Courts as ātmabandhus entitled to inherit. In United Provinces v. Kanhaiya Lal 16 Lucknow 551 it has been held that the father's father's daughter's son's son would be an ātmabandhu of the deceased. In an early case 1456 in British India two propositions were laid down, viz. (1) there must be mutuality of sapiṇda relation between the deceased and the claimant (i. e. each must be a sapiṇda of the other) and (2) that in order that a man may be an heritable bandhu of the deceased they must be related directly through themselves or 

1456. Vide Umaid Bahadur v. Udoi Chand 6 Cal. 119 (F. B. , 128 where it was held that a man's sister's daughter's son is a heritable bandhu but a remark was made (which was ao obiter diotum) that the sister's daughter's son's son would not be a bandbu of the propositus because the lātter was not a descendant of the grandfather of the former, his father or mother.

Propositions about bandhus

through their mother or father. These propositions were accepted by the Privy Council, 1457 which further said that sapinda rela tionship extends in the case of bandhus only up to five degrees. The first proposition about mutuality has some support in the interpretation put on the famous verse of Manu IX. 187 by the Balambbatti and the Subodhini (vide above note 1418). But difficulty is created about mutuality by the unwarranted assumption that the common ancestor must be a member of one out of four families as stated by Sarvadhikari. The other propositions, however, are not supported by any texts or sound reasoning. Since the enumeration of bandhus is admitted to be not exhaustive, no sound inference can be drawn from the list of nine bandhus that a heritable bandhu must be connected with the deceased in any particular way. All that can be required is that he must be a bandhu as defined by the Mit, and connected with the deceased by having particles of the body of a common ancestor within the limits of sapinda relationship as laid down by the Mit. The limit of five degrees categorically laid down by the P. C. is not, it is sub mitted with great respect, based on very sure or strong founda tions. The Mit. says that sapiṇda relationship extends to seven degrees when traced through the father, that wherever the word 

sapinda' is employed this meaning has to be understood and it extends up to five degrees when traced through the mother. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 454-455. What is material is 

1457. Vide Ramchandra v. Vinayak L. R. 41 I. A. 290 (→ 42 Cal. 384 at pp.-418-421) for the propositions about mutuality, relationship through bimself, father or mother and restriction to five degrees. Dr. Sarva dhikari (T. L, L. p. 630ff) is not right ia inferring from the nine bandhus expressly mentioned in the verses quoted above that the propositus must be a descendant of a common ancestor who is a member of the following fami lies, viz. (1) claimant's agnate family, (2) claimant's mother's agnate family, (3) claimant's father's mother's agnate family, (4) claimant's mo ther's mother's agaate family. Following this opinion, it was held in Lowji u. Mithabai 2 Bom, L. R. 842 that the great-grandson of a sister is not an heir under Hindu Law, But this decision is against the definition of sapinda given by the Mit. apd is wrong. Vide Chinna v. Padmanabha 44 Mad, 121 pp. 128-130 for a reasoned and trenchant criticism of the re quirement of mutuality laid down without any discussion or explanation in the case of 6 Cal. 119 and the views of Sarvadhikari. It is to be regretted that owing to the ignorance of Sanskrit on the part of most judges that had to decide cases of Hindu Law, the opinions of individual learned authors like Mayne and Sarvad bikarl were followed without personal examination by judges of the authorities on which the opinions of authors were based.

not whether a female intervenes somewhere, but whether the person about whose sapiṇdaship a question is raised traces his descent to a common ancestor through his father or through his mother. In the P. C. case the claimant claimed sapinda. ship with the deceased through his mother, and it was rightly decided that he boing 6th from the common ancestor was not a bandhu. But to lay down as a universal rule that a bandhu in order to inherit under the Mit. should not be beyond five degrees from the common ancestor is against the definition of sapiṇda given by the Mit. itself and unduly narrows the express words of the Mit. The words of the P. C. 'the sapiṇda relationship, on which the heritable right of collaterals is founded, ceases in the case of the bhinna-gotra sapiṇda with the fifth degree from the common ancestor' (L. R. 41 I. A, 290 at p. 312) are very generally expressed and are susceptible of the interpretation that they lay down the rule of five degrees even when the claimant claims 1458 relationship with the deceased through his own father. Some support for the Privy Council rule that sapinda relationship ceases with the 5th 

1458. Vide Brij Mohan v. Kishun Lal (1938) A. L. J. 670 where the Allahabad High Court held that, even when the claimant traced sapinda relationship through his father, beritable bandhu relation ceases after the fifth degree. But in Kesar Singh v. Secretary of State for India 49 Mad. 652 at p. 690 it is said that, though in the P. C. decision there are some observations wbich at first sight imply that sapinda relationship of bandhus for inheritance ceases with the 5th degree in all cases, there is nothing to suggest that the Privy Council intended to do away with the wellknown distinction between bhinnagotra sapindas that claim relationship through their father and those tbat trace it through their mother. There is great diversity of view yet about what the P. C. meant in 41 I, A, 290. In Seelam Nagamma v. Reddam 1. L. R. (1943) Mad. 759 (F. B.) it was held that Dr. Sarvadhikari is wrong in his restrictions of heritable bandhus to the lines he propounds, that 54 All. 698 is wrongly decided and that 49 Mad. 652 lays down the correct law. On the other hand, in Hanmant v. Vasudev I. L. R. (1943) Bom. 465 it bas been held that the P. C. means that heri. table baadbug wbether claiming through the father or the mother must be within five degrees from the common ancestor. Vide Debi Das v. Mukat Behari I. L. R. (1943) All. p 131 which lays down several rules deducible from an examination of numerous cases. As an illustration of how the law of the succession of bandhus is in a bewildering state, the following two cases may be read. In Sakharam y. Ralkrishna 19 Bom, 739 (F.B.) it was held that a father'a sister's son is to be preferred under the V. Mayūkba to the maternal uncle, but the P. C. decided in Balsubramanya v, Subbayya L. R. 65 I. A. 93 that the maternal uocle is entitled to preference over the father's sister's son.

Succession of bandhus

degree from the common ancestor in the case of bhinnagotra sapiṇdas may be found in the words of Mitramiśra in his commentary on Yāj. I. 5%, in the implication of the words of Kullūka 1489 on Manu V, 60 and in the remarks of the Balambhatti (p. 191 ). But this view is opposed to other weighty authorities such as the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharma sindhu. 

The whole law about the succession of bandhus is in a confused state owing to conflicting decisions, but the P. O. has laid down certain propositions which may be set down here: (1) atmabandhus succeed before pitśbandhus and pitsbandhus before mātpbandhus ; (2) the nearer in degree in each class of bandhus is preferable to the more remote; (3) as between bandhus of the same class, the conferring of spiritual benefit would be a ground of preference, as the Viramitrodaya invokes that principle in several cases (and so the father's half sister's son would be preferred to the mother's sister's son, though both are atmabandhus and of equal degree ); (4) if the above three rules fail, bandhus ex parte paterna (on the father's side ) succeed before bandhus ex parte materna (on the mother's side ); (5) the bandhu between whom and the propositus a lesser number of females intervenes is to be preferred. As a corollary of the 2nd rule it should follow that the descendants of the propositus would be preferred to ascendants and collaterals and that ban dhus of the same class that are descendants of a nearer line would succeed in preference to descendants of a remoter line though of the same class. But this last proposition has not yet been settled by the Privy Council. It has been, however, held in Debi Dus v. Mukat Behari I. L. R. (1943) All. 131 that a sister's son's son should be preferred to the deceased's cousin's daugh ter's son, since the former belongs to a nearer line. 

For the purposes of this work it is irrelevant and unneces sary to wade through the mass of case-law on the succession of

bandhus. One or two matters, however, call for remark. If the theory of spiritual benefit be strictly applied, many of those who would inherit as bandhus under the Mit. system would be barred from inheritance. For example, the daughter's son's son 1459a or daughter's daughter's son would be a heritable bandhu under the Mitākṣarā, but under the Dāyabhāga he would not be 80, as he offers no piṇda to the deceased or to any of the latter's ancestors. It is probably to obviate this unnatural and unjust consequence that the Dāyatattva refers to the text of Bṭ. (quoted above in n 1419) in which the word 'bāndhavāḥ' occurs, remarks that the relatives of the father and mother of (the deceased ) inherit in the order of their nearness to the latter and quotes the three verses about the three classes of bandhus, indicating thereby that spiritual benefit is not the sole test, but that where it fails the test of blood relationship may be applied. 1460 

Very elaborate rules have been evolved by Sarvadhikari in his Tagore Law Lectures on the Hindu Law of inheritance (2nd ed. of 1922, pp.571-640). The author devoted great industry, labour and ingenuity in evolving those rules. But one regrets to say that he raised a stupendous structure on very slippery and meagre foundations. And the pity of it is that many Judges have more or less followed his lead, though emphatic disapproval of his views, whereby the list of bandhus capable of inheriting has been very much restricted, has not been wanting. 1461 It is not possible to examine here in detail his reasonings and results. But the futility of much that he has evolved can and must be briefly shown,' The only solid foundations that we have in the Mit. are: (1) the definition of sapiṇda given by it on Yāj. I. 53; (2) the remark that bandhus are bhinnagotra sapiṇdas (as contrasted with gotrajas); (3) that the bandhus of a man may be described under three classes; (4) that those that may be called atmabandhus succeed before those called pitsbandhus and these latter inherit before mātṛbandhus. It is agreed on all hands that

Sarvadhilari's scheme of bandhu succession 

761 

the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses of Śālātapa or Baudhā. yapa are only illustrative. Therefore, the nine bandhus ex pressly mentiond should not have been used to exclude any one as not a heritable bandhu, as we have not got anywhere an exhaustive enumeration. Any one who satisfied the first two requirements stated above was a bandhu. Of the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses quoted above, none is connected by direct descent with the propositus, his father or mother; but one is a descendant of his paternal grandfather, one of his paternal great-grandfather, two of his maternal grandfather, two of his father's maternal grandfather, one of his mother's paternal grandfather, two of his mother's maternal grandfather. Sarva dhikari makes a different classification of these (p. 627) viz. * two are connected through the father, three through the mother, two through the paternal grandmother and two through the maternal grandmother'. The whole trouble has been caused by this latter grouping. Instead of emphasizing lines of direct descent, he catches hold of females who are never spoken of in ancient works in connection with tracing descent ( except in the case of the mother of the man concerned ). If, because the illustrations given happen to be connected only with four lines of families, persons connected with the propositus through other lines are to be excluded, there is no reason why a man's own daughter's son's son, son's daughter's son, sister's son, or sister's son's son should be held to be bandhus. They bear no close analogy to the atmabandhus enumerated by Śātātapa. But it is admitted by Sarvadhikari that they are atmabandhus. The terms atmabandhu, pitsbandhu and mātsbandhu are mere labels or devices to show nearness and preference among bandhus. Acc. to the V. Mayūkha1462 the words pitpbandhu and mātsbandhu are to be dissolved as sasthi-tatvuruṣa compounds ( pituḥ bāndhavaḥ

or matuh bandhavaḥ) i. e, according to it pitbandhus or mātpbandhus are bandhus of the father or mother and must also be bandhus of the propositus if they are to inherit. It is not known in what context the three verses quoted in the Mit. and other digests from Satātapa or Baudhāyana occurred. In Manu V. 81 It is laid down that one should observo mourning on the death of a pupil, sacrificial priest and bāndhavas for the duration of paksini. It is possible that the three verses only illustrate what is meant by bāndhavas in such a connection, 

The Balambhatti ( vyavabāra p. 214 ) here also explains that females are included in the word 'bandhu', although the verses quoted speak of putrah' only and the Bombay and Madras High Courts have allowed female bandhus to inherit, though in Madras the position assigned to female bandhus is 

very much lower than in Bombay. 

Strangers as Heirs-In default of even bandhus, the Mit. states 1463 that the teacher(of the veda) is the heir of the deceased, in default of the teacher the pupil (and relies on Ap. Dh. S II. 6. 14. 3) and that in default of pupil ā sabrahmacarin ( fellow student whose upanayana was performed by the same teacher as that of the deceased and who studied the veda under the same teacher ) 1464 inherits. In the absence of even a fellow student the wealth of a brahmana was to be given to some grotriya (a brāhmana learned in the Veda ) as laid down by Gaut. ( 28, 39) and in default of a śrotriya in the same village, as said by the Dāyabhāga XI. 6. 27, to any brāhmapa, since Manu (IX. 188-189) says, 'in the absence of all (heirs ), brāhmaṇas that have studied the three vedas, that are pure and restrained, take the wealth; in this way dharma does not suffer : the rule is that the wealth of a brahmana should never be taken by the king'. Nār, 1465 ( dāyabhāga, 51-52 ) is to the same effect. To the game

This direction of so many ancient sages has not been respected in modern times. 1467 Manu (IX. 189) and Bṛ. 1468 (S, B, E. vol. 33, p. 380 verse 67) say that the wealth of kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras oscheats to the king in default of heirs up to a fellow student. When the king takes by escheat heirless property he has to set apart a portion of the wealth of the deceased for the maintenance of his concubines and servants and for the per formance of his funeral rites and sraddhas as stated by Kat. 1469 931. Kaut. IIL 5, Nār.(dāyabhaga,52) provide that the king (when he takes heirlege property ) should provide maintenance for his women and both tle Mit. and the V. Mayūkha explain that the word' women' stands for avaruddhastri (exclusively kept concubine) and not for his wives ( who would succeed as heirs and then there would be no escheat), because the word * patni' is not employed in the verse. These verses of Nār. and Kāt. are the foundation of the right to maintenance of a concubine against the heirs of the deceased paramour in modern times. 1970

[Vol. 

Yaj. (IL. 137) states a special rule 1471 which is an exception to the general rule of inheritance laid down in II. 135-136 vie. '(the heirs) who take the wealth of a forest hermit, a yati (ascetic), a (perpetual) vedio student are in order the ( vedic) teacher, a virtuous pupil, one who is looked upon as a brother and belongs to the same order! According to the Mit. the heirs mentioned are to be taken in the reverse order of the words of the text i. e. the ācārya ( who is mentioned first among the three heirs ) is to be taken as the heir of the last of the three mentioned in the first half of the verse, so that the teacher, good pupil and the person looked upon as brother are respec tively the heirs of the perpetual student, the ascetic and the forest hermit. According to the Dāyabhāga also the reverse order has to be taken, but it says that the wealth of the forest hormit, yati and perpetual student is taken respectively by one looked upon as brother, a worthy pupil and teacher, but that in the absence of these, any one who is in the same āśrama as the deceased may take it. According to the Madanaratna 1172 the order of heirs is the direct one, that is, the teacher, good pupil and accepted brother take the wealth of the forest hermit, ascetic and perpetual student, since the Visnu Dh. S. (17. 15-16) expressly says so. The Mit. adds that a brahmacārin is of two kinds viz. perpetual ( naisthika) and upakurvana ( who intends to remain as a student for some time and then marry in order to confer the benefit of male progeny on his ancestors ), that

Succession to an ascetic

Yajñavalkya's words apply only to the former, that if the latter ( upakurvāṇa ) leaves any wealth of his own it is taken by his mother, father and the other heirs. The Mit. further says that a worthy pupil is one who is capable of studying the philosophical parts of the Veda, of understanding them and of acting up to them, that a badly behaved pupil will not succeed, so also a badly conducted teacher shall not succeed. The Mit. explains that Yāj. III. 47 allowed a forest hermit to accumulate materials that will be enough to meet his needs for a day, a month or six months or a year and so he may on his death leave some wealth. Similarly, though an ascetic was required by Gautama ( U. 10 ) to make no accumulation of wealth, yet even an ascetic requires clothes to cover his body, he has his sandals and books on Yoga and the like ; and so also the perpetual student requires these. 

· The heirs enumerated above succeed to persons in those religious orders in priority of their kindred. It has been held that members of the three twice-born classes alone can be ascetics with the result that their pupils inherit and not the kindred and that in the case 1473 of sūdra ascetics their kindred succeed unless some usage to the effect that a pupil inherits is proved.

* Reunion.-A rounion properly so called can take place only between those who were parties to the original partition. Reunion, therefore, postulates three stages, viz. (1) joint family, (2) partition between members of a joint family, (3) an inten tion and an agreement, express or implied, to reunite in estate among members who were parties to the partition. If persons who had separated in interest merely stay together, that is not

reunion in law, as sald by the Sm. C. II. p. 302 and Vivadar candra 174 p. 82. The Vivadacandra quoting Visnupurana says that reunion may be implied from a course of conduct, even though an express agreement cannot be proved. There is a divergence of views as to who can reunite. The Mit., the Dayabhaga 1175, the Sm. C. hold, literally construing a verse of Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 381 verse 72 ), that a member of a joint family when once divided can reunite only with his father, brother or paternal uncle, but not with any other relation (such as a paternal uncle's son or paternal grand-father), while the V. C. (p. 157), the V. Mayūkha (p. 146), the V. P. (p. 533) hold that the members expressly mentioned by Bç, are only illustrative and that a person may reunite with any member who was a party to the original partition. A reunited person is called sainsęsta or saṛsrstin 1476 ( who has reunited wealth). The subject of reunion has a comparatively ancient history. Gaut. 28. 26 states the general rule that on the death of a reunited co-parcener the surviving reunited member succeeds to the share of the deceased. Kaut. (III.5p. 160) states 1477 that those, who live together though they may have no ancestral estate or do so after dividing their ancestral estate, may divide their reunited estate again in equal shares. Manu IX. 210 (=Viṣnu Dh. 8. 18. 41) is similar to it.

Devolution after reunion 

767 

The verses of Yaj. (II. 138-139 ) 1478 on succession to a deceased reunited person are understood by the Mit. to be an exception to the rules contained in Yaj. II. 135-136 laying down that the wife and others inherit the property of a person dying sonlegs. Therefore it follows that where a person reunites with his brother and then dies leaving a son not reunited with him, it is the son who will inherit and not the brother, though reunited. But if A separates from two sons B and C of whom B reunites with him and C does not and then A dies, then the reunited son B succeeds to A's interest and C takes nothing. This is expressly stated by the Vivādacandra p. 85 that relies on the Smṛtisāra 1479. The two verses of Yāj. (II. 138-139 ) are variously read and interpreted by the Mit. and other commentators and it is not possible nor quite necessary to set out all these readings and explanations. Acc. to the Mit the two verses mean: 'in the case of a deceased reunited per son, the surviving ) reunited member should give ( to the posthumous son of the former ) the share of the deceased but may take it himself if there is no son ( but only a wife ); but from among the reunited brothers, the full brother, if reunited, should similarly give to the posthumous son of the deceased the latter's share and ( if there be no son ) he should take it himself to the exclusion of reunited half brothers; a re united half brother takes the wealth of the deceased reunited member ( dying sonless ) and not another half brother who is not reunited; a full brother, though not reunited, may take the wealth along with a half brother who is reunited but the latter will not alone be entitled'. In this interpreta tion the word 'asamsýsti' in the latter half of II. 139 has to be taken in two connections, once with anyodaryaḥ' in the first half and then again with 'saṁsrstaḥ' ( in the 2nd half). This last word is to be understood in two senses, viz. 

1478. संधिनस्तु संखष्टी सोदरस्य तु सोदरः । दद्यादपहरेराशे जातस्य च मृतस्य चा अन्योदर्यस्तु संबष्टी योदर्यो धन हरेत् । असंहष्टबपि वादवात्सलतो नाग्यमातुजः॥ gr. II. 138-139. The first is fargerike 17. 17 also. Tra (p. 747) reads

(1) full brother (with the preceding word asamsrsti) and (2) * reunited' (with the word 'anyamātsjah'). Further, aco, to the Mit. we have to understand 'eva' after. anyamātsjah'. Aparārka (p. 748) reads differently and he, Visvarūpa and Srikaramiśra (Dayabhāga XI. 5-16 ) explain that a full brother though not reunited takes the whole estate and not the half brother though reunited with the deceased. The V. Mayūkha differs from the Mit. when it says that the word apurczsya (of one dying sonless) is not to be understood with Yāj. (II. 138). It derives two propositions from the first half of Yaj. II. 138, viz (1) the wealth of one dying reunited is taken by tho surviving reunited member of members; (2) in a competition between reunited full brother and reunited half-brother, the former takes the whole. The latter half of II. 138 is an independent sentence (and not joined with the preceding half as the Mit, understands) and applies where a reunited member dies leaving a wife who is pregnant but that fact being unknown the other reunited members divide the estate. In such a case if a son is born the surviving members should hand over to the son the share of the deceased reunited member. But if no such son is born then the survivors may take the estate. In II. 139 the Mayūkha holds that the words "anyodarya' and ' anyamātsja' are not restricted to brothers only, but apply to a paternal uncle or his sons or other persons who were reunited, because their mother is also different from the mother of the deceased. The Daya bhāga discusses Yāj II. 138-139 under the topic of succession to the separate property of a sonless man and its treatment of succession to reunited property is very meagre ( vide XII ), 1480 The V. P. p.-533 notices this and levels against Jimūtavāhana the criticism that he got confused. Aparārka (pp. 748–749) seems to be of the same opinion as the Dāyabhāga. The V. P. follows the Mit. and criticizes the explanation given by Śrīkara, Sm. C. and others ( pp. 535-538). It says that the texts of Saṅkha, Narada and others conflict with the text of Yāj. II. 135 and that the order of heirs as to a •reunited co-parcener is based on express texts and not on Yāj, II. 135 1481 or logical reasoning. Accord ing to the V. P. the order of succession to a deceased reunited

The V. Mayū. kha gives the order as follows: (1) son if reunited; (2) son not reunited, though there may be reunited members (other than a gon); (3) the parents if reunited in preference to other reunited persons (other than a son); (4) full brother if re united; (5) full brother not reunited and half brother reunited; (6) half brothers and uncles, if reunited; (7) other male mem bers reunited (in preference to wife though she be reunited); (8) wife if she be reunited ; (9) full sister (or daughter accord ing to another reading );1482 (10) any other sapiṇda who is nearest. It is to be noted that Manu IX. 212 prescribes a peculiar rule of succession for reunited co-parceners viz. that full brothers (not rounited) and full sisters of the deceased reunited co-parcener equally inherit along with half brothers that are reunited the wealth of the deceased. This verse of Manu has been variously explained by Kullūka, Apararka p. 749, Sm, C. (II pp. 304-305 ), Nilakantha, Vivādacandra (p. 83) and others. 

It may be stated here that cases of reunion come very rarely before the courts.

## 30 Strīdhana

CHAPTER XXX 

STRĪDHANA 

Stridhana ( woman's property ). This subject abounds with differing views on several topics that fall under it, as will be Been below. 

The germs of the topic of stridhana can be traced to the Vedio Literature. As Sir Gooroodas Bannerjee remarks (in : Marriage and Stridhana' p. 370 ), ' nowhere were proprietary rights of women recognized so early as in India; and in very few ancient systems of law have these rights been so largely conceded as in our own'. The wedding hymn in the Rgveda ( X 85 ) contains two verses 1483 ( 13 and 38) which indicate that gifts were sent to the bridegroom's house with the bride, They are : 'the bridal gifts of Sūryā that Savits sent off have gone forth; in the Agbās (Magha constellation) are struck the kine and in the Arjunis ( Phalguni constellation) is carried ( the bridal gift ); for thee in the beginning they carried about Sūrya together with the bridal gifts &o.'. Sāyaṇa explains 'vahatu' as 'cows and other objects given for pleasing the girl to be married', while Lanman ( Harvard O. series vol. VIII p. 753) renders it as 'bridal car'. Sāyaṇa's interpretation suits the context much better. In the Tai. S. VI. 2. 1. 1 we read, 1484 'the wife ( of the sacrificer) holds on ( to the cart), for the wife is the mistress of the household gear'. Manu IX. 11 uses the word 'pāriṇahya' (household gear) and states that the wife should be entrusted among other matters with the supervision over it. Jaimini 1485, according to Sabara, refers to 

1483, warang: 

A PAT TETE I NIE Tam atrati ogga u तुभ्यममे पर्यवहन सूर्या पहनना सह । पुनः पतिभ्यो जायां दा अमे मजया सह ॥ . x. 85. 13 and 38. These are almost the same as ferrata 14. 1. 13 and 14. 2. 1.

Evolution of woman's property

this passage of the Tai. S. for establishing that women do own certain property. Medhatithi 1486 on Manu VIII. 416 ( cited above on p. 452) quotes this passage of the Tai. S. and argues that if Manu VIII. 416 ( saying that whatever a wife earns is her husband's ) were literally understood passages like the one in Tai. S. would have no scope and that therefore Manu simply means that though women may be owners they cannot dispose of the property independently. It appears from these ancient passages that the properties, which in early days were held to be owned by women, were presents made at the time of marriage (such as ornaments and costly dresses) and household articles that are generally under the control of women and that the later smrti rules about the devolution of stridhana in the female line arose from the peculiar nature of the articles over which dominion was conceded to women. This early state of things is indicated by some of the early sūtras. Ap. Dh. 1487 S. (II. 6. 14. 9) states the view of some predecessors ( which Āp. himself does not approve) that the ornaments belong to the wife and also such wealth as came to her from her agnates (father, brother &c.). Baud. Dh. S. II. 2. 49 says that daughters get the orna ments of their mother and whatever else it is customary for them to get. Vag. 17. 46 prescribes that women ( daughters ) should divide the nuptial presents given to their mother. Saṅkha (q. by Sam. Pr. p. 851 ) prescribes that in all forms of marriage ornaments and stridhana should be given to the girl. It may be that Manu VIII. 416 only gives expression to an ancient opinion, that the literal meaning of that verge was given up long before and that all that Manu meant was that during coverture a woman was subject to the control of the husband as regards her stridhana. 

..Three principal topics have to be discussed under stridhana viz. what constitutes stridhana, woman's dominion over her

stridhana and inheritance to stridhana. On each one of these topics great diversity of views prevails and the subject has become very complicated, as the Dayabhāga remarks 1488 

Gautama contains three sūtras about the devolution of stridhana, but he does not define or describe it. 1488a Kaut. (III 2. p. 152 ) defines 1489 : 'means of subsistence and what could be tied on the body (i, e. ornaments and jewellery ) constitute stridhana, The means of subsistence should be fixed at 2000 (panas) as the maximum, while there is no limit to ( what may be given) as ābadhya ( ornaments &c.)'. This may be com pared with a verse of Kāt. (902) and a similar 1490 verge of Vyāsa viz. the father, the mother, the husband, brother and kinsmen should give stridhana to a woman according to their means up to two thousand (panas ) except immovable pro perty'. The Sm. C. and V. Mayūkha explain that this limit of 2000 applies to gifts made every year, but that if a gift is to be made once for all, then more may be given and even immovable property may be given. 

The term stridbana literally means 'woman's property'. But in the ancient smrti works the word was restricted to certain special kinds of property given to a woman on certain occasions or at different stages of her life. Gradually such kinds of property went on increasing in extent and value. We have to follow this evolution of the meaning and content of the word stridhana. One characteristic feature of stridhana from the times of Gautama downwards has been that it devolved on females in the first instance. The oldest extant definition of it

in Dharmaśāstra 'works is that of Manu 1491 IX. 194: 'what (was given) before the nuptial fire, what was given on the bridal procession, what was given in token of love, what was received from her brother, mother or father, that is called the sixfold woman's property'. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 143 explains that the number six is intended to exclude & smaller number of the kinds of stridhana and does not exclude a larger number. In IX. 195 Manu appears to mention one more kind viz. 'anvā dheya' ( gift subsequent)! Nār. ( dāyabhāga, 8 ) has the same six kinds as Manu IX. 194, but reads 'bhartļdāya' (the hus band's gift ) for Manu's what is given in token of affection, the latter being thus wider than Nārada's words. Yāj. (II. 143 44) enumerateg 1492 the several kinds of stridhana as follows: "what was given (to a woman) by the father, mother, husband or brother or was received by her before the nuptial fire, or what was presented on her husband's marrying another wife (adhivedanika) and the like these are denominated stridhana; so also what is given by the cognate relations ( of the woman), the sulka (fee), and gifts subsequent to marriage'. The Mit. and most of its followers read 'ādhivedanikādyam ca', while Aparārka and the Dayabhāga read 'ādhivedanikam caiva', the difference being that if one reads as the Mit. does, several other kinds not expressly enumerated can be easily included under stridhana. But it should be noted that even without reading 

kādyam', Aparārka explains the verse in the same way as the Mit. does. Viṣnu 1493 Dh. S. 17. 18 enumerates almost the same kinds of stridhana as Yaj., but omits the word 'ādya'. 

Among smrti writers Katyayana gives the most elaborate treatment of stridhana in about twenty-seven verses. He

defines several kinds of stridhana enumerated by Manu, Yaj., Nar., and Visnu (in all six) as follows 1494 : what is given to women at the time of marriage before the nuptial fire is declared by the wise to be adhyagni 1495 stridhana. That again which a woman obtains when she is being taken (in ā procession) from her father's house (to the bridegroom's) is declared to be adhya vahanika stridhana. Whatever is given to a woman through affection by the father-in-law or mother-in law and what is received by her at the time of doing obeisance at the feet ( of elders) is said to be pritidatta (gift through affection) stridhana. That is declared to be sulka ( bride's fee) which is obtained as the price of household utensils, of beasts of burden, of milch cattle, ornaments and slaves. Whatever is obtained by a woman after marriage from the family of her husband as also from the family of her (father's) kingmen is said to be anvādheya (gift subsequent). According to Bhṛgu whatever is obtained by a woman after marriage through affection from her husband or from her parents is anvādheya'. It may be noted that Katya yana's definitions of adhyagni and adhyāvahanika are wide

enough to include gifts made even by strangers on those occasions. 

These definitions given by Katyāyana have been accepted by all digests including even the Dayabhāga. 

"That is known as suudāyika which is obtained by a married woman or by a maiden in her husband's or father's house from her brother or from her parents" (Kāt.). Some of the divergences in readings and in interpretation deserve to be noted. Acc. to the reading adopted by the Mit. adhyāvahanika includes all gifts made by any one when the newly married girl is taken from her father's house in a procession, while the reading adopted by the Dāyabhāga 14% and some others ( paitȚkāt) restriots the adhyāvahanika to gifts made by the father's or inother's family only. The V. R. (p. 523 ) includes under adhyāvāhanika also the gifts made by the father-in-law and others when the girl is taken back to her father's house and the V.C. (p. 138 ) says that it is what is obtained at the time of 'dvirūgamana'. The Dāyabhāga 1497 (IV. 3. 19-20 p. 93 ) explains 'dohyabharapa-karmiṇām' differently as 'the gratifica tion paid by house-builders or goldsmiths to induce her to press her husband to engage thern' or as Vyāsa says 'what is given to a woman to induce her (cheerfully) to go to her husband's house '. The Sm, C. and V. P. explain sulka as the price of the articles which the bridegroom was in the habit of presenting to the bride at the time of marriage or when he started a house. 1498 The V.

1498. The change in the meaning of sulkā is interesting. One mean ing of sulka is 'tax or toll on merchandise'. Vide Vianu Da S. III. 29, Yaj. II. 173, 261, Vas, 19. 37. Pāṇini V. 1. 47 uses that word in that sense (archivarengantar fon) and the Kaśikā explains it as foragit mara y t. Another sense is 'the fee paid to the bride or her parents by the bridegroom in consideration of marriage'. The word occurs in 

(Continued on the next page)

History of Dharmasastra 

( Vol. 

Nir. (p. 468 ) states that sulka has two sensos ; (1) what is given as the price of the girl to the guardians of the girl which goes to the mother and brother (on her death); (%) what is given ( by the bridegroom ) as the price of the ornaments for the girl and of the household gear. 1499 Another verge of Kāt. (904) has been quoted by many writers, which restricts the literal sense of the word stridhana, 'over that wealth that is obtained by a woman by mechanical arts (such as spinning ) or from a stranger through affection, the husband has ownership. 

(Continued froin the last page) 

Gaut. 28. 23 and in Saṅkha (svayan sulkanı vodha) q. by V. R. p. 321. In very ancient days there appears to have been a practice to offer in some casos considerable wealth to the father of the bride to induce him to give her in marriage. Rg. 1. 109. 2 refers to this : 'O Indra and Agni! I have heard that you are more liberal than even an unsuitable (or deficient) son in-law or even a brother-in-law'. Yaska (VI. 9) in explaining this verse remarks that the southern people speak of the husband of the bride that i purchased as vijāmātṇ' (for Paṣa Timors: TOPTATUM HE FATA P ona:)But this verse also shows that the bride's brother (syāla) bad to give wealth to his sister's husband. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 503-506 for passages about the sale and purcbase of girls in marriage from ancient times right down to 1800 A. D. Though sometimes girls were purchased for marriage, popular feeling gradually asserted itself against this, In the Vanaparva (115. 23 ) Gadhi claims as the custom of his family one thousand horses of the best kind from Rcika when the latter prefer red bis suit for the hand of GĀdhi'daughter (fent : foran परस्समवर्तितम् । एकता पामकर्णाना पाणुराणां तरसिमाम् । सहनं वाजिनी शुल्कमिति of fr ). Vide Anuśāsana 4 12 ( for a similar statement) and 2. 31. Mana III, 51 forbids the taking of even a small gratuity through greed by the father when giving away his daughter in marriage and says that if he does so he would be guilty of the sale of his child and in III. 54 (almost the same as Agusāsana 46. 1-2) Manu says that when agnates do not appro priate to themselves the gratuity paid ( by the bridegroom) for the bride but band it over to the bride then it is not sale, but it is honour shown to the girl and is merely kiadness to her. The Mit. defines sulka as the gratuity after getting which the girl is given. The V. C. p. 139 deines it as what is obtained from the husband on condition of furnishing household gear &c.

the rest is declared to be stridhana :.1500 The prima facie view (purvapaksa) in Jai. VI. 1.12 urges that what a woman gets by serving cooked food or by cutting clothes does not belong to her. The gifts from strangers here referred to are other than those made by a stranger before the nuptial fire or at the time of the bridal procession. This definition makes it clear that what is obtained even from a stranger by a maiden or by a woman who is a widow at the time of the gift is pure stridhana, Devala says, 'maintenance ( what was given for maintenance), ornaments, sulka (bride's gratuity ), the profits of money-lending are a woman's stridhana. She alone is entitled to enjoy it and the husband is not entitled to enjoy it except in the case of distress'. 1501 Manu IX. 200 states, the heirs of the husband should not divide ( among themselves ) the ornaments worn by women during the lifetime of their husband; if they divide them they incur sin'. In the printed editions of Manu there is no comment of Medhātithi on this Verse, but the V. R. (p. 509), V. C. p. 139, Dayatattva p. 184 all say that acc. to Medhātithi oven ornaments, though not donated expressly, become stridhana, if worn with the husband's consent. 1532 According to the Vaijayanti such ornaments should be assigned to the share of the woman's husband so that she alone might put them on and that it is not meant that such ornaments are not to be taken into account at all at the time of partition.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Saudāyika is not a special kind of stridhana, It is rather a comprehensive term for several kinds of stridhana as the defi nition given by Kat. shows and as the v.C.(p. 139) expressly states 1503. It is almost synonymous with stridhana in the tech nical sense. Acc. to most writers, it is wealth received by a woman, whether as a maiden or as a married woman, in her father's or husband's house from her parents or relatives of the father and mother. The Sm. C. II. p. 282 and V. R. p. 511 hold that saudāyika is all wealth obtained by a woman whether as a maidon or as a married woman from her mother, father or paternal relatives only, while the Diyabhāga IV. 1. 23 pp. 76-77 and V. C. hold that saudāyika includes also all property donated by the husband except immovable property, which latter she cannot alienate even after her husband's death. There is a Verse of Vyāsa 1504 that defines saudayika similarly, 'whatever is obtained by a woman as a maiden at the time of marriage and after marriage from the house of her father or husband is termed saudayika.' The word 'saudayika' is derived from 

sudaya' and means, according to the Dayabhaga IV. 1.22 p. 76, ' received from affectionate kindred'. The Amarakosa Bays that 'sudaya' means 'gifts of yautaka and the like' and that saudayaka is merely a derivative without change of meaning. 1505 

Another word requiring explanation is 'yautaka'. It occurs in Manu IX. 131, 'whatever is the yautaka of the mother goes to the maiden daughter' (and not to the married daughter or son). So yautaka seems to be a synonym for stridhana in

the technical sense. The Sm. 1506 O. II p. 285, Madanaratna (folio 105 b ) and V. Mayūkha remark 'yautaka is that wealth that is received as a gift from anybody by a woman while she is seated together with her husband at the time of marriage and the like'. It is derived from yuia ( joined ). It should, however, be noted that Yaj Il. 149 employs the word yautaka as an adjective in the sense of separated' and that Medhatithi on Manu IX. 131 explains 'yautaka' as the separate property of a woman, her stridhana. The Sm. O. II. p. 285 remarks that Devasvāmi derived "yautaka' from 'yu' (to separate ) and held it to mean 'wealth obtained from the family of the woman's father which is separate in its characteristics'. The V. C. p. 142 and Vivādacandra p. 74 read 'yautuka' and the former explains it as gifts from the father and the like at the time of marriage. The Dayatattva (p. 186 ) states that both forms 'yautaka' and 'yautuka' are in vogue and relies on Vācaspati and Rayamukuta in support. 

Kaut. (III. 2. p. 153) names sulka, anvādheya, adhivedanika and bandhudatta as kinds of stridhana. 

The above are the principal smrti texts on the question of what constitutes stridhana. It will be seen that the smrtis only enumerate and describe certain kinds of property as stridhana, which word is not used by them in the etymological sense of 'all kinds of property possessed by a woman'. They do not attempt a comprehensive definition of stridhana. From the texts of the smrtis it follows that stridhana was a technical term, which at first included only six kinds of property, then nino and ultimately by the time of Katyāyana it included all property (whether movable or immovable) obtained by a woman, either as a maiden or at marriage or after marriage.

from her parents or the family or relatives of the parents or from the husband and his family (except immovable property given by the husband) and that what was obtained by a woman after her marriage by her own labour or from strangers did not become stridhana. Most emptis employ the word 'datta' ( donated ), but Kat, and Vyāsa sometimes use the word * obtained' (prāpto or labdha), which is ordinarily wider than 

datta'. But it is clear that the commentators do not expressly. say that 'obtained' includes inherited', though from their general remarks to be quoted below it is arguable that they probably included inherited property under property obtained. 

This is stridhana in a technical sense. 

It is now necessary to find how stridbana was defined by the several commentaries and digests that are held authorita tive in the several schools. This is a most important matter for practical purposes, since the courts have to follow the opinions of commentators 1507 that are authoritative in each school and are not at liberty to put their own construction upon ancient smsti texts, if such construction would run counter to the express opinions of the authoritative commentators. First then comes the Mitakṣarā. Its gloss on Yāj. II. 143 may be translated as follows 1508; 'whatever is given by the father, mother, husband and brother; what was presented by the maternal uncle and the like at the time of marriage before the nuptial fire; and adhivedanika, that is, gift made (by the husband) at the time of marrying a second wife as will be described subsequently in the words he should give to the wife that is superseded'( Yāj. II. 148 ); by the word ' adya' (meaning and the like ') is indioated property that is obtained by succession, purchase, partition, seizure or finding-all this is declared by Manu and others to be stridhana. The word stridhana is employ ed here in its etymological sense and not in a technical sense, since, when the etymological sense is possible, it is improper to resort to the technical sense.' The Mitakṣarā expanded the

definition of stridbana so as to include under it the five kinds of property of which a man becomes owner in various ways according to Gautama X. 39. The result is that, according to the Mit., property of any description belonging to a woman be comes stridhana even if it be inherited by her from a male as a widow or as a mother or even if it be obtained at & partition by a wife or mother (acc. to Yaj. II. 115 or 123 respectively). The same interpretation of the word 'adya' has been accepted by several works, such as the Madanapārijāta (p. 671 ), the S. V. (p. 379), V. P. (p. 542 ), the Bālambhatti. Aparārka without reading "ādya' gave the same explanation of 'ca' as stated above ( on p. 773). On the other hand, the Dayabhāga gave a restricted meaning to the word. Jimūtavāhang reads Yāj. II. 143 as 'ādhivedanikam caiva', quotes the verse of Devala (in note 1501), remarks that stridhana is not restricted to the six kinds of Manu (IX, 194) but includes other kinds mentioned by other smrtis and finally 1509 observes : 'that alone is stridhana which a woman has authority to donate, sell or enjoy indepen dently of her husband's control'. The Dāyabhāga does not expressly state the kinds of property that a woman can dispose of independently of her husband, but immediately after defining stridhana it quotes the texts of Kāt. (about earnings from mechanical arts and gifts from strangers), and Nār. (IV. 28), 

what has been given to a wife by her loving husband, she may spend or give away as she likes even after his death excepting, immovables'. From this it follows that, according to the Dāya bhāga, all gifts from relations except a gift of immovable pro perty mada by the husband and gifts from even strangers made before the nuptial fire or on the bridal procession constitute stridhana, but property inherited by a woman or obtained:on, partitiou, gifts from strangers (other than the two kinds noted above) and property acquired by her by mechanical arts or by her labour are not strīdhana, The Dayatattva olosely follows the Dayabhāga. See on 

The Sm. C. does not give a defintion of stridbana, but it, does not adopt the interpretation of the word 'ādya? given by:

the Mit. Therefore it may be said that it is in line with the Dayabbāga. The Par. M. IIL p. 547 1570 (another Madras autho rity ) appears to follow the Mit., since it says: “adya' in cludes adhivedanika' and what is acquired by inheritance, sale and the like." The Vivādacintamani (the leading authority in Mithila ) does not define stridbana in general, but enumerates the several kinds of strldhana described by Manu, Yāj., Visṇu, Kat., and Davala and so is on a par with the Dayabhāga. The V. Mayūkha divides stridhana into two kinds, pāridhāṣika (tech nical) and aparibhā șika ( non-technical). The former comprises properties expressly stated to be stridhana by the sages, while the latter includes all other property belonging to a woman (except what is called technical) and acquired by her by parti tion or cutting (sewing or other mechanical arts). 1$11 This division is peculiar to the V. Mayukha. The Viramitrodaya (the paramount authority in the Benaros school) agrees with Mit. as stated above. 

It is beyond the scope of this work to go deeply into modern caselaw, But it is necessary to show how the Indian Courts have in modern times dealt with stridhana as defined by the oommentators. It may be said at once that the inclusion by the Mite of property inherited by a woman or obtained at a parti. tion under stridbana has been totally discarded by the Privy Council for all provinces in India except Bombay 1512 A woman may inherit property from a male, such as from her husband, father or son or she may inherit property from a female, that is, from her mother, daughter &c.

are stridbana according to the Mit., but the Privy Counoil has held as to both these kinds that they are not stridhana; e. g. if a daughter inherits property from her father or inherits the stridhana property of hér. mother, it does not become her stri dhana, that on the death of the daughter, the property does not pass to her heirs, but to the next heir of the person from whom she inherited it. The Bombay school makes a distinction. If a woman enters a family by marriage and then inherits to a male of-that family (as e. g. a widow succeeding to her husband, a mother to her son or a predeceased son's widow to her father in-law), the property she inherits is not her stridhana, she takes only a limited estate in it and on her death it passes to the next hoir of the male from whom she inherited. But if a woman inherits from a male belonging to the family in which she was born (e. g. a daughter succeeding to her father, a sister to her brother) or if a woman inherits property from a female, the property so inheritad becomes her stridbana (in Bombay). As to property acquired by a wife or mother on partition 1513, it has been held by the Privy Council that it is not stridhana even in provinces governed by the Mitakṣarā (including Bombay). . 

Kāt. (903) declares : 1514 'whatever was given to a woman for wearing only on some occasion (or on condition) or with fraudulent intent by the father, brother or husband is not held to be stridhana.' The idea is that if the father or husband gives some ornament to his daughter or wife for wearing on some special occasion (upādhi ) or if a father or husband in fraud of his co-parceners gives some family property to his daughter or wife it cannot become stridhana. 

Dominion over stridhana.“What is stridhana and what dominion a woman has over stridbana depend on three things, viz. the source of acquiring the property, her status at the time of acquisition (i. e. whether she was a maiden or a married woman whose husband was living or a widow ), the school of law by which she is governed. Cortain verses of Kat, and Nar. are the principal texts on this subject. Kāt. (905-907, 911)

Bays:1515 'on obtaining wealth of the saudāyika kind it is dec lared (lit. desired) that women have independent power over it, since it was given by them (the kindred) as support (or maintenance ) in order that they (women) may not be reduced to a terrible (or wretched) condition. It has been declared that women always have independence in saudāyika property as re gards sale or gift at their pleasure and even in immovables (if sandāyika). A woman, when her husband is dead, may deal with the gift (of movables) given by the husband as she pleases, but she should preserve it as long as he is alive or she may spend it on his family. Neither the husband nor the son, nor the father nor the brothers have power to use or alienate the stridhana of a woman'. The verge of Kat. about property acquir ed by labour or about the gift from strangers through affection and that of Nārada about the gift of immovable property made by the husband have already been quoted. From these texts it follows that a Hindu woman during her maidenhood 1516 could dispose of her stridhana property of every description at her pleasure, that during her widowhood she could dispose of every kind of stridbana including movable property given by the husband but not immovable property given by him and that a married woman whose husband was living could dispose of at her pleasure only that kind of property called saudūyika (i. e, gifts from relations except those made by the husband).

non-saudāyika is retained, 1517 but the distinction between sau dayika given by the relations and that given by the husband is not kept. 1518 Now the woman's power to dispose off as she likes depends on the question whether the gift was meant to pass an absolute estate or a limited estate even if the husband was the donor. During marriage when the husband is living her domi. nion depends under modern law upon the character of the stri dhana. If it is of the kind called saudāyika she can dispose of it by sale, gift or will as she likes without her husband's con sent; but as to other kinds of stridhana property (such as gifts from strangers, property acquired by mechanical arts or property inherited ) she cannot dispose of it without her husband's consent. If she disposes of it without such con sent the alienation is void. According to the D. B. IV. 1. 20 property acquired by a married woman by mechanical arts or by gift from a stranger is subject to the husband's dominion during his life and may be taken by him even when there is no distress. No one else ( except the husband) has got control over oven such stridbana. After the hus band's death, she can dispose of even non-saudāyika stridhana as she likes. But even as regards saudāyika the texts concede certain rights to the husband in certain circumstances. Yaj. II. 147 says: 'the husband is not liable to return to the wife her stridbana taken (i. e. used) by him in a fanine, for (indispangable ) religious acts, in disease, or when imprisoned ( by the creditor or by the king or an enemy ). 1519 

1517. Vide Bhau v. Raghunath 30 Bom. 229 (where it was held that property inherited by a woman from her father could not be bequeathed by her without the consent of the husband who survived her).

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. 

Kāt. (914) 1530 has a similar verse which says that he may return stridhana wealth if he chooses to do so when it is used by him in a disease or in oalamities or when haragged by creditors. Kaut. (III. 2 p. 152 ) is closely similar to Yaj. and adds that the woman can spend it without blame for the maintenance of herself, her son and daughter-in-law or when the husband has gone abroad without making provision for the maintenance of these. Kaut (III. 2. p. 152 ) further provides 1521 that thero should be no complaint (by the wife ) as regards the expenditure of stridhana made more than three years before by joint action of the busband and wife when they have given birth to two children (or to twins) and when the marriage has been in the most approved forms (brahma and the other three ), that when stridhana has been expended by ( the husband and wife) that are married in the gāndharva or āsura form both should be made to restore it with interest and that what is expended when the marriage is in the rākṣasa or paitāca form the expenditure of stridhana should be dealt with as theft. The meaning of 'mithunam prajātayoḥ' and 'trivarsopa bhuktam' in Kaug. is not quite clear. It is probable that Kautilya lays down a rule of limitation. If more than three years are allowed to pass without complaint, then no complaint made later (than three years after the expenditure ) would be enter tained. So also if there be no children of the marriage and the husband expends strldhana without objection by the wife then also no complaint would be entertained as the restraint on alienation of stridhana by the husband and wife was meant for the benefit and advancement of the children. None of the later smrtis like those of Yaj., Nār. or Kat. makes these distinctions and so Kaut. probably represents an early stage in the evolution of the husband's dominion over stridbana. These later smrtis hold that the husband and wife may be entirely separate as regards their properties and as a general rule the husband's debts, are not binding on the wife's properties nor are the wife's separate debts binding on the husband or his properties (Yaj. II. 46,

Vienu Dh. S. VI. 31-32). But the same smrtis make it olear that ander certain distressing circumstances the wife's separate property was liable for the maintenance or debts of the husband. The Mit. expressly states 1521a that if the husband uses his wife's stridhana under any other circumstances (thau those specified by Yaj. IL. 147 and Kāt.) then he has to return it, that no relation except the husband has any right to use a woman's stridbana during her lifetime even in distress or disease &o. and relies on Manu VIII. 29 which requires the righteous king to award the punishment for theft against such relatives as appropriate the wealth of women. The Sm. C. and V. Mayūkha follow the Mit., but the V. R. and V. O. hold that Kātyāyana's verse applies not only to the husband, but also to the son, father and brothers of the woman. Kat. (912-913 ) provides 1521a that if any one of the four persons (q. in n. 1515 above) forcibly consumes stridhana he should be made to return it with interest and should be also liable to fine (or punishment) and that if any one of these congumes stridhana amicably after securing her consent then he would be liable to return only the principal amount, when he becomes well off (i. e. able to pay ). Devala 1522 also states, if the husband makes a gift of stridhana without cause or enjoys it, he must pay it back with interest, but he may use the stridhana of his wife for relieving the distress of a son (and also of the family, aco. to V. Mayūkba). Kāt. (908) 1523 adds a special rule, 'if the husband has two wives and he does not reside with one of them (1. e. neglects her), he should be forcibly made to return ( the stridhana of his neglected wife ) by the king even though she bestowed it upon him through affection.' The texts of Kat., Devala and Nār. quoted above about the dominion of the woman over her stridhana and about the husband's power over it are

authoritative in all schools even now. Manu IX. 199 1524 provid es: *wives should not spond ( for their own benefit) from the property of their families which is common to many, nor from their own property without the husband's permission.' The V. Mayūkha interprets this as meaning that she has no independent power even over adhivedanika and the like, but this would be opposed to the express texts of Kat., Vyasa and Dovala. Therefore the words must be taken as only recommen datory. 

Kāt. (916) delivers a special rule viz. stridhana 1525 which was promised ( to a woman) by her husband should be paid to her as a debt by the sons ( i, e. by her own song or stepsons) provided she resides in the husband's family; she should not reside with her paternal family.' The Sm. C. and V. P. (p. 546) explain that even grandsons and great-grandsons are liable to pay just as sons are. According to Kāt. as understood by the Sm. O. and others a wife who is full of evil acts, is immodest, wastes property and is given up to adultery, does not deserve ( to disposo of stridhana and V. P. and V.O. explain that it may be taken away from her in such a case. 1526 In modern times this rule of forfeiture of rights would not be enforced by the courts as regards stridhana. Some explain this verge as referring to the widow as heir and separate the words as 'stri dhanam. '1527 Vide Ganga v. Ghasita 1 All. 46 (F. B.), 48-49.

Succession to stridhana

on any other. But one thing is generally common to all schools viz. that as regards succession to stridhana daughters are prefer red to sons, though in later days sons were introduced by some writers as heirs along with daughters or even as preferable to daughters for certain kinds of stridhana. This was probably due to the fact that the value of stridhana property became considerable in later times and society which held to the doctrine of the dependence and inferior position of women could not tolerate the idea that large estates should go to women alone. The causes of the variance among writers on the devolution of stridhana are historical. The text-writers wrote at different times and in different countries and probably reflect the popular sentiments of their own countries and times tinged now and then by personal predilections also. The digests sometimes expressly say that their interpretation follows the usage of their times ( vide V. Mayūkha in note 1529 below). 

The succession to stridhana varies according as the woman is unmarried or married, according as the marriage was in an approved or an unapproved form, and also according to the species of stridhana and the school of law to which she is subject. 

First, the important texts of the smstis on succession to stridhana may be brought together. The oldest extant text is that of Gaut. 28.22 which provides, 1528 'stridhana devolves (first) on daughters; (in a competition among daughters ) it goes to those that are unmarried (apratta, lit. not given away in marriage ) and ( in a competition among married daughters ) to those that are not well provided for (i. e. that are indigent).' Manu (IX. 192-193 ) provides : 'when the mother dies all the full brothers and full sisters should equally divide the mother's estate. Even to the daughters of those daughters some thing should be given ( that is ) as much as would be seemly out of the estate of their grandmother on the ground of affection'. In Mapu IX. 195 it is said that the six kinds of stridhana, as also anvādheya strldhana and gifts made by the busband through affection, should go to her progeny if she dies in her husband's lifetime. The verses of Manu (IX. 192-3) are variously explained by the commentators, Sarvajña-Nara yana holding that mother's estate means estate other than technical stridbana. Most of them rely on a text of Bṛ. and

hold that full brothers and unmarried sisters succeed together and married sisters (i. e. daughters of the woman whose heirs are to be found) get some trifle (\# of each brother aco, to Kullūka). Manu IX. 196-197 further provide that when a woman was married in one of the five forms of marriage viz. Brahma, Daiva, Arsa, Prajapatya and Gandharva and died without issue her stridhana goes to her husband and if she was married in the Asura and the other two forms it went, if she died issueless, to her mother and father. Yaj. II.1520 117 pro vides that daughters take the stridhana estate of their mother and on failure of them the (male) issue. In II. 1530 144 Yaj. again says that stridhana goes to daughters, but that if the woman dies without issue then it goes to the husband if she was 

married in one of the four forms (brahma, daiva, arsa, praja patya ) but to her parents if she was married in the other four forms. Visnu Dh. S. (17. 19-21) and Nar. ( dayabhāga, 9) contain the same rules as Yaj. II. 144-145, while Nar. (daya bhaga2) states that the mother's wealth should be divided among the daughters and in the absence of daughters the latter's issue takes it. Saṅkha-Likhita.1531 declare that the mother's estate is taken in equal shares by the full brothers (sons of the deceased mother) and their unmarried sisters. Bç, 1532 (S. B. E.

Devolution of sridhana

33 p. 383 verse 87) declares, 'stridhana goes to her progeny, but the unmarried daughter is preferred, while the married one gets only some trifle as a token of regard'. Parāśara holds that the unmarried daughters take all the stridhana, but in a competition between married daughters alone and sons they all take equal shares. Devala 1533 states, 'on the death of a woman her stridhana is taken in equal shares by her sons and daughters; if she leaves no issue it would be taken by her husband, mother, brother or father'. Pāraskara 1534 (g. by Par. M. III. 552 ) states that stridhana devolves on the unmarried daughter, that the aon does not get it, but that he shares equally with a married daughter. Kauṭ. 1535 (111.2 p. 153 ) prescribes that if a woman dies during her husband's lifetime her sons and daughters divide her strldhapa; if she has no son then daughters divide it, on failure (of both sons and daughters) the husband takes it and that the sulka, anvādheya or any other kind of stridhana given by her relatives is taken by her relatives. Kātyāyana 1536 (917-920) whose treatment of stridbana is the most detailed of all smrti writers has the following verses on succession to stridhana: 'Sisters whose husbands are living should share with their brothers the stridhana ( of their mother ); this is the rule of law about stridhana and partition (among brothers and sisters) is prescribed. On failure of daughters the (stridhana) wealth devolves on sons (of the deceased woman); the wealth given to a woman by her kinsmen (paternal or maternal) goes in the absence of the kinsmen (that gave it) to the husband,

(Vol. 

Whatever immovable property was given by the parents to their daughter always goes to her brother if she dies without issue. Whatever wealth was obtained by a woman from her parents in the forms of marriage beginning with agura is declared as going to her parents on failure of her progeny.'1537 The first two verses are apparently in conflict and must be read with Gaut. 28. 22. So probably the following propositions were laid down by Kat. viz. (1) unmarried daughters are preferred; (2) married daughters whose husbands are living share along with their brothers, if there be no unmarried daughter; (3) widowed daughters take only if there are no daughters whose husbands are living or if there are no sons ; (4) wealth given by paternal and maternal kinsmen goes to them and on failure of these, to the husband; (5) immovable property given by parents goes to the brother of the woman on failure of issue; (6) wealth given in the Asura, raksasa and paisāca forms goes to parents on failure of issue. Yama has a verse very similar to Kātyāyana's about a woman married in the asura and the following forms. The commentaries and digests make valiant efforts to reconcile the conflicts among the smrti texts quoted above. It is not quite necessary to go into that question here in detail for fear of encumbering this work too much. 

How the devolution of stridhana was dealt with by the commentators has now to be seen. They all prefer daughters to sons for certain kinds of stridhana. Why the devolution of stridhana property should be different from that of the property of & male is not clearly explained anywhere. The Mit. on Yāj. 1538 II. 117 gives the reason that woman's property goes to the daughter because in her more particles of the mother's body inhere than in the son. Probably the daughters were preferred as heirs to stridhana as a sort of equity, when sons were allowed to exclude daughters in the inheritance to the father's wealth. 

According to the Mit. there are two lines of succession to stridhana, one for sulka and the other for all other kinds of stria dhana. Sulka, aco. to the Mit. that quotes Gaut., devolves first

on the full brothers, then on the mother. 1539 Some like the Subodhini, the Dipakalika, Haradatta on Gaut. 28. 23 hold that it devolves on the mother first and then on the full brothers ; but many works such as the Dayabhaga IV. 3.28 (p. 95), Sm. O., Par, M., V. P., V. C. follow the Mit. It is somewhat strange that the Madanapārijata p. 668 ( which was really composed by the author of the Subodhins in the name of his patron Madanapala, holds that the sulka is first taken by the brothers and then by the mother. This raises a doubt whether the printed Subodhini is correct or whether the author changed his opinion. 

As regards succession to the property of a maiden there is no difference at all between the Mit. and other works. The Mit. quotes a text of Baudhayana 1540 that the wealth of a deceased maidon first devolves on her full brothers, then on the mother and then on the father. The V. P. adds that on failure of the father the maiden's wealth goes to the parents' nearest sapinda.1541 Yaj. II. 146 provides that if a girl who had been promised in marriage dies before marriage, the intending bridegroom was entitled to take back the sulka or other gifts

· The Mitakṣard order of succession for all kinds of stridhana, other than sulka and maiden's property, is as foliows: (1) unmarried daughter; (2) married daughter who is indigent; (3) married daughter who is well 

provided for; (4) daughter's daughters ; (5) daughter's Bon; (6) sons; (7) son's sons (here also the rule of per stirpes applies ); (8) husband ( if the woman was married in one of the four approved forns); (9) sapiṇdas of the husband in the order of propinquity ; on failure of any sapipda of the husband, her mother, then her father and then the sapindas of the father (before it goes to the Crown). But if the woman was married in one of the unapproved forms, then on failure of her descen dants her stridhana went to her mother, then to her father and then to the father's sapiṇdas in the order of propinquity. On failure of the sapiṇdas of the father it would (by analogy) go to her husband and then to his sapiṇdas ( before going to the Orown). When grand-daughters directly inherit the stridhana of their grandmother they take per stirpes (aco. to the Mit. which quotes Gaut. 28. 15), if they are the daughters of several daughters: 1542. The-Mit. (on Yaj. II. 145), Aparārka (p. 721) and several others provide (following Manu IX. 198= Anusagana 47.25) that if a woman of a lower caste dies issueless leaving stridbana, then the daughter of her co-wife of a higher class inherits that stridbana and on failure of such step-daughter, the son of the latter'inherits. It may be noted that as regards succession to stridhana, the rule of representation which holds good in relation to succession to males does not apply. When a male dies leaving separate property and a son and a grandson (son of & predeceased son). both succeed together, the grandson re presenting his deceased father. But if a woman possessed of stridhapa dies having only a son and a predeceased son's aon; the son will take the whole of the strldhana excluding the son's son Vide Bui Raman vs Jagjivandas 41 Bom. 618. . ::

books having authority in the different provinces will be offer ed. According to the Sm. C. ( which is the leading authority in Madras after the Mit. ) stridhana includes only those kinds of property that are so described in the smrtis ( i. e. only technical stridbana ) and the lines of devolution are as follows: (1) sulka devolves in the same way as laid down by the Mit. cited above (Sm. C. II. p. 287); (2) Yautaka devolves on unmarried daughters first (Sm. O. II. p. 285 ); (3) Anvādheyaka and Bhart;datta pass to sons and married daughters whose husbands are living, all inheriting together in equal shares ( Sm. C. II. p. 284); (4) other kinds of technical stridhana such as adhyagni &o. pags brst to the maiden daughters and married daughters who are apraliṣthita, 1543 then to married daughters that are provided for; then to daughter's daughters, then to daughter's sons, then to sons, thea to son's sons &c., then to the husband or father (according to the form of marriage ). The Madras High Court follows the Mit. (in preference to the Sm. 0.) as to the devolution of Anvādheyaka and Bhartsdatta and holds that certain kinds of non-technical stridhana (such as gifts by strangers during coverture) devolve acc. to the rules of the Mit: Vide Salemma v. Lutchmana 21 Mad. 100. 

The Vivāda cintamani, the leading authority in Mithila, restricts stridhana to the technical stridhana recognized by the smrtis and lays down the devolution of it as follows: (1) Sulka 1544 ( defined as property received by a woman at the time of her marriage, if in an unapproved form ) passes as under the Mit. cited above; (2) Yautaka passes first to unmarried daughters, then in the way laid down by the Mit. for all stridhana ; (3) all technical stridhana other than the two praceding varieties passes to sons and unmarried daughters together, then to sons and married daughters jointly, then to daughter's daughters, then to daughter's sons and then as under the Mit. system (for stridbana in general.)

The first is subdivided into four classes for the purpose of inheritance; (I) sulka which passes as stated above under the Mitakṣarā ; (II) yautaka goes to unmarried daughters, ( if there be no unmarried daughters ) 

1545. For the territory in which the V. Mayūkha is supreme, vide Lallubhai v. Mankuvarbai 2 Bom. 388 (F.B ) at p 418, Jankibai v. Sundra 14 Bon. 612 at pp. 623-24; Vyas Chimanlal v. Vyas Ramchandra 24 Bom. 367 (F. B.) at p 373. How the Vyavabāramayūkla composed by a Mahā. rāstra brāhmana whose family had settled at Bepares came to be regarded as a work of bigla authority in Gujarat is explained in Lallubhai v. Man. kuvarbai 2 Bom. 388 at pp. 418-419 and in Bhagirthibai v. Kahnujirav 11 Bom. 285 (F. B.) at pp. 294-95. As there is divergence between the views of the Mit and the Mayūkha in the rules of succession, it becomes & matter of great practical importance to settle with precision the exact limits in Northern Konkan up to which the Mayūkha must be regarded as a work of paramount authority. It has been judicially decided that Karanja, an island opposite tho Bombay harbour, is governed by the Mayūkba (in Sakha ram v. Sitabai 3 Bom. 353), that Mahad, the southernmost Taluka of the Kolaba District, is not so governed and that the predominance of the Mayū kha cannot be taken further south than Cheul and Nagothna in the Kolaba District (vide Narhar v. Bhau 40 Bom. 621). Similarly difficult questions arise whether Kathiawar which is quite contiguous to Gujarat and some territory bordering og Gujerat towards the north or east is governed by the views of the Mayukha in preference to those of the Mit. Some parts of Kathiawar which were (and even now are) under the domination of the Gaikwad of Baroda may, on the analogy of the grounds on which the Maya kha is held to be of paramount authority in Gujarat, be deemed to be goverded by the Mayūkba. It appears to me that the tendency of courts should be to restrict the extent of the territory in wbich the Mayūkha is supreme and to bold that everywhere the Mitākṣarā is stipreme, except in those territories where the Mayīkba has been expressly recoginzed as supreme by the feuda tory States contiguous to Gujarat or by judicial decisions. The Mit. is the paramount authority in the whole of India except in Bengal; therefore on the analogy of tho maxim tbat a general role is applicable aod is supreme in all cakes except where an exception clearly covers the matter (Haur PUNTO T 

i ta) districts outside moderu Gujarat but bordering on it should not be beld to be governed by the Mayūkha.

then probably to the married daughters; (III) anvādheya 1445 a and bhatrpriti-datta ( husband's gift of affection) are inherited by sons and unmarried daughters together in accordance with Manu (IX. 192 and 195), (if there be no unmarried daughters ) by sons and married daughters, then daughter's issue, then son's song; (IV) other 1546 kinds of technical stridhana devolves as under the Mit; (V) non-technical 1847 stridhana is inherited in the following order; song, son's song, sons' eons' sons, daughters, daughters' sons, daughter's daughters. When there is no issue of the woman the succession depends in all cases as under the Mit. on the question whether the woman was married in an approved or an un-approved form. The V. Mayūkha employs language somewbat different from that of the Mit. in speaking of the inheritance to stridhana when a woman dies without

In the Dayabhāga school the devolution of various kinds of stridhana according to the Dayabhaga and D. K. S. is as follows: (I) sulka devolves 159 in the following order: (1) full brother, (2) mother, (3) father, (4) husband; (II) Yautaka de volves 1550 in the following order:(1) unmarried and unbetrothed daughters, (2) betrothed daughters, (3). married daughters, who have or are likely to have sons, (4) barren married daughters and childless widowed daughters taking together in equal shares, (5) song, (6) daughter's sons, (7) Bons' sons, (8) son's son's sons, (9) step-son, (10 and 11) stepson's son, stepson's grandson. Then if the marriage was in an approved form, yautaka passed in the absence of any of the above in order to husband, brother, motber and father. If the marriage of the woman was cele brated in an unapproved form then her stridhana passed in order to mother, father, brother, husband.

As regards Ayautaka (i.e. all technical stridhana other than the above three) there is a conflict of authority between the Dayabhaga (IV.2.1-12 pp. 79-81) on the one hand and Raghu nandana and Srikrṣna on the other. Acc. to the former the order 1552 is: son and kumūri daughter (or to either on failure of the other); (on failure of both) married daughters that have sons or are likely to have song , son's sons; daughter's sons%3B barren and widowed daughters. But Raghunandana and Sri krsna interpolate sor's son, son's son's son, stepson, stepson's son, stepson's grandson between daughter's sons and barren and widowed daughters. In the decided cases the latter order bag generally been followed.

brother's son, sister's son, husband's sister's son, brother's son, daughter's husband. Bś. says that the mother's sister, maternal uncle's wife, paternal unole's wife, father's sister, mother-in law, elder brother's wife are declared to be like one's mother, that when these women have no aurasa ohild or a son of their co-wife or a daughter's son or & son's son or stepson's son, then the sister's son and the rest may take their wealth. This text, 800, to the Dayabhāga, simply declares that a sister's son and the others may be heirs to the stridbana of the maternal aunt and the rest but the priority is determined among the six heire mentioned above in Bșhaspati's text by the principle of reli gious benefit. Though the sister's son is the first in Bphaspati's text, it is the husband's younger brother who stands really the first among the six if regard is had to the principle of religious benefit. The Vir. (V. P. p. 554 ) states that in the absence of heirs up to the stepson and stepson's sons, the sister's son and the rest (mentioned in Br.) are the heirs to a woman's stri dhana even when sapiṇdas like her father-in-law are alive, since mere sapinda relationship would not count when in conflict with a special toxt. It does not appear that the V. P, holds that the six take in the order stated in the text of Br.; 1554 it rather states that among these six the choice of the preferential heir

The above verses of Bṛ. mean that males who are a woman's sister's son or her husband's sister'a son or her husband's brother's son or her owo brother's son or her daugh, ter's husband or her husband's younger brother are like her son and inherit ber stridbana io certain circumstances.

would be determined by greater or less propinquity 1555. On failure of these six the husband's sapindas, sakulyas and samānodakas take and then the father's kinsmen. 

The question of an unchaste daughter's succession to stri dhana would be decided in the same way as her succession to her father's property. Under the Dayabhāga an unchaste daughter will not succeed. But under the Mitākṣarā as inter preted by modern courts an unchaste daughter who is a kept mistress or a prostitute may succeed but only after virgin daughters or married daughters as the case 1856 may be. The Mit. on Ya. Il 290 relies upon the Skandapurana for the proposition that prostitutes are a fifth caste descended from certain apsarases. 1557 

It has been held by the courts that though prostitution entailed degradation according to ancient Hindu Law, it did not sever the tie of blood. So the stridhana of a naikin ( a dancing girl) or of a married woman who becomes a prostitute may be inherited by her brother or sister or her husband or her husband's relations. 1558 

It may not be out of place here to suggest how stridhana should be dealt with when Hindu Law comes to be codified as it is likely to be in the near future. It may be urged that all distinctions on the ground of sex should be altogether done away with and whenever a woman succeeds to any property whether of a male or of a female she should take an absolute estate. But if this change is opposed by a large volume of opinion as it is quite possible, then it should at least be provided

that all property which a woman Inherits from a female should be her absolute property. Then as regards inheritance to stridhana one simple and straightforward rule should be laid down that the woman's sons and daughters should succeed together taking equal shares. A third suggestion would be that when there are no descendants of the woman herself, then the husband should be the next heir. When the stridbana is that of a maiden, the heirs in order should be her brothers and sisters, then her mother, then her father and after the father the latter's nearest heir. It is not quite necessary at this stage to specify what further rules of devolution should be prescribed. 

## 31 Maintenance and other topics

CHAPTER XXXI 

MAINTENANCE AND OTHER TOPICS 

The subject of maintenance occupies an important place in modern Hindu Law. A brief statement of the law of the smrtis and the digests on this subject must be made here. 

The liability to provide maintenance for certain persons arises under the ancient Hindu Law in either of two ways viz. (1) on account of bare relationship between the parties or (2) on the ground of the possession of property. A verse 1559 quoted by Medhatithi on Manu III. 7% and IV, 251, by the Mit. on Yāj. 1. 224 and II. 175 and occurring in some mss. of the Manusmrti after XI. 10 provides, 'Manu declares that one must maintain one's aged parents, a virtuous wife and a minor son by doing even a hundred bad acts.' From this verse it follows that irrespective of the possession of property there is a personal legal obligation on the father to maintain his minor son, on the husband to maintain his wife and on the son to maintain his aged parents. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 48) goes further and provides 1560 that a son is bound to maintain a mother even if she be patita. To the same effect are Āp. Dh. S. I. 10. 28. 9 and Vas. 13. 47. 

1559. haftas Fruta: fg: 137TATA ET TETT HECH वीत् । मेधा. on मनु IV. 251 quotes part of itas स्सुत्यन्तर, while theमिता.on या. II.175 ascribes it to Manu. This verse is cited in Savitribaiv. Luxmibai 2 Bom, 573 (F.B.) at p. 597 (wbicb holds that a Hindu widow voluntarily living apart from her husband's relatives is not entitled to a money allowance as maintenance from them if tbey were separated from him at the time of his death and that she is not entitled to such maintenance from tbem wbether they were separated or unseparated from him at the time of bis death if they have no ancestral estate belonging to him in their hands). The texts of Manu, Yāj. 1. 76 and Nār, are held on p. 598 of that report to impose a personal obligation enforceable by the State, Vide Raja Rama Rao v. Raja of Pittapur 45 1. A. 148 at p. 154 where it is stated that the grandson is not included under the word 'son' and a grandfather is under no personal obligation to maintain a grandson if there is no ancestral property in bis hands. .. 1560.

History of Dharmatastra 

[Vol. Manu VIII. 389 prescribes that the man who abandons and does not maintain his parents, wife and son, when they are not patita, should be fined 600 pams by the king. Nār. also (S. B. E. 33 p. 184 verse 95) provides punishment for such a husband. Yāj. I. 76 states that if a man abandoned a wife who was obedients diligent, the mother of a son and agreeable in speech he was to be made to give one third of his property to the wife and to maintain her, if he had no property. Viṣṇu Dh. 8. V. 163 made the husband punishable like a thief if he abandoned his blame less wife. Kaut. II. 1 prescribes 1561 that if a man being able fails to maintain his child or wife, parents, minor brothers and sisters, unmarried daughters, widowed daughters, when these are not patita, should be fined twelve panas. These dicta have been followed even by modern courts in India. In Subbarayana v. Subbakka 1562 it has been held that a son is bound to maintain his aged mother whether he has inherited property from his father or not. 

The manager of a joint Hindu family is under a legal obligation to maintain all male members of the family, their wives and children. Nārada states 1563 that if any one among Beveral (undivided ) brothers dies without issue or becomes an ascetio the rest should take the estate and give maintenance to his wives till their death, provided they keep the bed of their husband unsullied but that they may cut off the maintenance If they (wives) behave otherwise. This is because the surviv ing brothers succeed to the estate in which the deceased had an interest during his lifetime. This is made quite clear 1564

Maintenance of widows 

805 

in the Sm. C. explaining a verse of Nar, viz.' widows that are virtuous must be maintained with food and raiment by the eldest brother (of the deceased) or by the father-in-law or by any other gotraja' on which it remarks:: "The words by him who takes the estate'must be understood before all the words such as 'the eldest brother'". Kāt. ( 922 ) states, when the husband goes to heaven the wife is entitled only to food and raiment if he was unseparated or she may set a share in ( ancestral ) property till her death'. The Sm. C. remarks that as maintenance depends upon taking wealth, Kāt. provides two alternatives. In cases too numerous to cite this has been followed by all High Courts. Similarly an heir is bound to maintain out of the estate taken by him those persons whom the deceased was legally or morally bound to maintain. Those persons who are excluded from inheritance or partition are entitled to maintenance and their virtuous wives and unmarried daughters also are entitled to be maintained ( Yaj. II. 140-142 Manu IX. 202, Vas. 17, 54). The Baud. Dh. S. (II. 2. 43-46 ) 1565 provides that those who are past undertaking transactions (i. e. are very old ) should be given food and raiment and also those who are blind, idiotic, impotent, immersed in vice and suffering from ( incurable ) diseases, and those that engage in prohibited acts, except the patila and his issue. Devala ( quoted in the V. Mayukha p. 165 ) has a similar passage, when the father is dead (or even when being alive he makes a partition) the impotent, the leper, the lunatic, the idiot, the blind, an outcast and his offspring, a person wearing a heretical sect mark-these are not entitled to a share of the heritage; to these except the patita food and raiment are to be given'. These persons suffer from a personal disqualification and maintenance is given to them in lieu of a share not because their status is denied but because they are incapable of management and enjoyment of property. Vide Raja Ram Rao v. Raja of Pittapur. 1566 

The general principle is that an heir is legally bound to provide outrof the estate taken by him as heir maintenance for those persons, male or female, whom the late owner was morally or legally bound to maintain.

soquired property is not legally bound to maintain his daughter in-law ( widow of a predeceased son); but on the death of the father-in-law, his heir i. e, son, widow, or daughter would be legally bound to maintain a widowed daughter-in-law. 1566a The Bombay High Court, however, adds the condition that the predeceased son must have been in union with his father when he died ; vide 23 Bom. 608. 

By Act XVIII of 1937 it has been provided that in a family governed by the Mitakṣarā the widows of deceased copardeners such as the daughter-in-law and the grand-daughter-in-law are entitled to their husband's interest. The Act does not expressly state that their rights to maintenance are taken away. In many cases such widows may prefer to take a share instead of being allotted only maintenance and so far the law of mainten ance will tend to become obsolete. 

Another important question is what is the effect of uncha stity on the right to maintenance ? As regards the wife's right to maintenance and the effect of unchastity thereon during the busband's lifetime, vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 571-73 above. Manu XI. 176 says that a wife guilty of adultery should be confined by the husband in the same house and should be made to undergo the same penance as a man guilty of adultery has to undergo; Yāj I. 70 also says that a wife guilty of adultery should be deprived of her status as a wife as to wealth and religious observances, should be given bare maintenance and should be confined to a part of the house. Unohastity on the part of a Hindu widow disentitles her to maintenance under certain circumstances Vas. 21. 10 provides that four classes of wives must be abandoned viz. one who yields herself to her husband's pupil or to his guru and especially one who attempts the life of her husband or who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste and in 21. 12 Vasiṣtha states that the wives of brahmaṇas, ksatriyas and vaibyas, who commit adultery with a sūdra, may be purified by penance if no child is born ( of the adulterous intercourse) but not otherwise'. It is provided by Yaj. I. 72 that if a woman ( of the three higher castes ) conceives through adultery with a sūdra or kills her foetus or attempts the death of her husband or is guilty of grave sins (such as brahmana-murder ) she shall be abandoned.

Maintenance and unchastity 

801 

Manu IX. 188 provides that when women beoomr patita, the rite callad ghatasphota (the procedure of which may be seen at P. 388 of the H. of Dh. vol. II and in note 1168 in the Appendix to this volume ) may be performed, but they must be given food and raiment and they must be provided with a hut near the family house. Yaj. III. 296 has a similar provision. The result is that there is no text which provides that a widow who is once unchaste must be deemed unchaste for ever and must for ever forfeit her olaim even to a starving snaintenance even if she repents, reforms her ways and gives up an immoral life. On the contrary the texts say that widows guilty of adultery are purified by penance and may be restored to all their social privileges. For example, Manu 1567 XI. 189 says generally about all persons that after they perform the appropriate prūyascitta, they should not be rebuked or avoided (but should be restored to all social intercourse ). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 72 expressly says that the abandonment of oven such women as are referred to in that verse consists in not associating with them conjugally and in religious matters, but does not mean that they are to be driven out of the house. 1568 

On Yaj. III. 297 ( which states that in the case of women there are three peculiarly grave sine piz, adultery with a low caste man, killing the foetus and attempt to murder the husband) the Mit. sumg up the whole position as follows: (1) total abandonment of women for the four grave sius laid down in Vas. 21. 10 takes place when they do not perform penance; (2) women guilty of adultery not of the aggravated kind mentioned in Vas. 21. 10 are to be given starving maintenance that would keep body and soul together and are to be lodged in & hut near the house and to be afforded protection (Yaj. I. 70 and III. 296 ), even if they do not perform the requisito penance. But the Mit. is silent as to the claim to maintenance of widows that at first led a life of incontinence ( but not of the aggrava ted kind) and subsequently reformed their ways. But from Manu XI. 189 it may be inferred that widows not guilty of

aggravated adultery that have undergone the proper prayascitta and that return to decent life would have been entitled to ordinary maintenance from the period they turned over a new leaf. 1569 

A brief reference to the modern case law on this point may be made here. In Bhikubai v. Hariba 1870 Sir Lallubhai Shah ( after an elaborate examination of ancient and medieval authorities and decided cases ) hield that a widow who had been unchaste, but who is proved to have given up the life of un chastity is entitled to baro maintenance. In Lakhmichand v. Anandi the Privy Council make the general observation : 1571 It is true that the right of a Hindu widow to maintenance is conditional upon her leading a life of chastity and that she loges that right if she becomes unchaste'. In Kisanji v. Lakshmi 1572 it was held that subsequent unchastity disentitled a widow from recovering maintenance, even though it is claim able under an agreement made with the deceased husband's father and brother. In Musammat Ganga v. Ghasita 1 All. 46 (F. B.) it has been held that unchastity does not incapacitate a daughter from inheriting stridhana. In Angammal v. Venkata 26 Mad. 509 the same rule was laid down. 

The illegitimate son born of a sūdra concubine to a man of the three higher castes appears to have been held entitled to maintenance from very early times. Gaut. 28. 37 provides, *the son from a sūdra woman of a man (of the three higher varpas ) who is without issue receives maintenance (lit, source of maintenance ), if he is obedient, in the same way as a pupil might receive'. And Gautama (28.43) extends the same rule to the offspring of pratiloma unions. Vide p. 601 above and note 1135 for the text of Gaut. and Br. on the point. Manu IX.

Maintenance of an illegitimate son 

809. 

155 also provides that the son of a man of the three higher castes from & sūdra woman (not married to him) is not entitled to share in the ancestral estate. Bp. (8.B.E. 33 p. 374 v. 31 ) states 1573 that an obedient and meritorious son born from a woman of the śūdra caste to a man who has no other child should get main tenance and that the sapiṇdas should divide the rest of the wealth of the deceased. Both the Mit. and the V. Mayūkba, while explaining Yaj. II. 133-134 about the rights of the illegitimate son of a sūdra from a śūdra woman, remark that one who is begotten on a dāsi 1574 by a member of the regenerate classes is not entitled to a share even at the father's choice nor to a half share after his father's death but that he is only ontitled to maintenance. 1575 

There is a good deal of case law on this subject, but much of it is irrelevant in this treatise. The right of maintenance attaches in the first instance to the separate property of the putative father and if the latter leaves no such property but was a member of a joint family it attaches to the property of the joint family of which the putative father was a member. 1576 It has further been held that it does not matter if the woman was not a dāsi (a slave ) or a permanent concubine in the exclusive keeping of a man or that the intercourse was adult erous. 1577 It has been also held that the illegitimate son's right to maintenance is a personal right and cannot be transmitted to his son 1578 and that maintenance has to be provided for him till his death 1579 (and not merely up to his attaining majority),

except in Bengal. 158 The fact that the texts employ the word " sūdrāputra" (in the masculine gender) has been interpreted by the decided cases as involving that an illegitimate daughter is not entitled under Hindu Law to maintenance. Vide Parvati v. Ganpatrao 1581 and Vellaiyappa v. Natarajan. 1582 

Another frequent subject of litigation in modern times hag been a concubine's right of maintenance under the Hindu Law, It has been held that a concubine has no legal right to claim maintenance from her paramour during the latter's lifetime, as he can discard her at any time and as she cannot compel him to keep her. 1583 So also a Hindu is not entitled to transfer joint family property to a concubine for her maintenance during his lifetime. 1584 But on the death of the paramour a great difference is made in the rights of a concubine that was in his exclusive keeping till his death. Such a concubine has been held to possess a legal right to maintenance payable out of the estate, ancestral or self-acquired as the case may be, in the hands of those who take it after the death of the paramour. The rights of women, who are not wives, to maintenance are based mainly on two texts, viz. of Nārada and Kātyāyana, that are explained in the Mit., the V. Mayukha and other medieval works. Narada says : 1585 ' A king devoted to dharma should give maintenance to the women ( stri) of a deceased person (when the king succeeds as heir by escheat), except when the deceased person is a brāhmana'; while Kāt. (931 ) states, 1586 " heirless property goes to the king after keeping aside ( wealth sufficient to provide ) for the women (yosit), the dependents (or servants ) and the funeral rites and sraddhas (of the deceased)'.

Kaut, algo similarly prescribes (HII, 1587 5. p. 161 ), the king takes heirless property except that of Srotriyas, setting apart ( wealth ) for the maintenance of women ( of the deceased), for funeral rites and for poor or wretched (dependents of the deceased). The Mit., the V. Mayūkha, the Par. M. and others state that the verses of Nār. and Kāt, refer to avaruddha. stri alone, since the word patni ( duly wedded wife ) does not occur therein, but only the words 'yoṣit' and 'stri '. 1586 There has been a great divergence of views in the decided cases about the significance of avaruddha stri. It is generally rendered as 

a concubine or mistress in the exclusive keeping of a person till the latter's death'. Several conditions are necessary to constitute a woman an avaruddha stri capable of claiming maintenance from the estate of her deceased paramour in the hands of his sons or other heirs. In the first place, she must have been continuously and exclusively in his keeping till his death. How long she should have been thus in his keeping cannot be fixed by any hard and fast rules. She must have been so long in his keeping continuously till his death that it can be said that the connection had become permanent. In Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai a period of five years was deemed to be sufficient. In the second place the concubine 1589 must observe sexual fidelity to her deceased paramour after bis death in order to be able to claim maintenance from the estate in the hands of his heirs or successors. In Bai Monghibai v. Bai Nagubai 1590 a third condition was laid down yiz, that the con nection of the concubine with the deceased paramour should be perfectly open and recognized and she must have been kept practically as a member of the family. But in Bai Nagubai v. Bai Monghibai 1591 the Privy Council overruled the above deci sion and held that in order to entitle a mistress to maintenance it is not necessary that she should have resided in the same

sen overtuinoids that are the estate 

house with the deceased together with his wife and the ordinary members of his family. And in Dayavati v. Kesarbai 1592 it was further held that the concubine need not prove that she was recognized by the family of the deceased or that his relationsbip with her was known to the family. A further restriction was imposed by the case of Anandilal 1. Chandralai 1593 that the intercourse with the paramour should not have been adulterous. But this case has been overruled by a recent Full Bench deci. sion in Alcku v. Ganesh 1594 which holds that a permanently kept concubine is entitled to be maintained out of the estate of her deceased paramour, although she has a husband living ( who was examined in the cage as a witness ), provided she observes sexual fidelity to the deceased paramour after his death. It becomes, therefore, necessary to examine the Sanskrit medieval commentaries and digests in order to arrive at a correct inter pretation of the expression 'avaruddha stri', Strangely enough, the Mit does not define the word in the section on dayabhāga, but only under stri-sangrahapa'. Yaj. II. 290 provides,' a man should be awarded a fine of fifty panas, if he has intercourse with disis that are avaruddhā or that are bhujipya and also (other women such as prostitutes and svairinis ), even though ordinarily they (i: e. dāsis and others ) are approachable (with out incurring the consequence of punishment). The Mit. explains that the word 'ca' placed after 'bhujisyāgu' in Yāj. II. 290 is meant to include vesyas and svairiṇis along with bhuji gyās. Acc. to the Mito the verse prescribes the same fine for intercourse with three kinds of women, viz. dāsis that are ava ruddha, dāsis that are bhujisyā and other women such as vesyās (who are ordinarily approachable by all males of their own or higher castes) and svairinis ( who abandon their husbands and resort at their desire to some other male of their own caste, as defined by Yāj. I. 67). A woman though originally a veryū or a svairini may be known to be kept by a man. In that case if another man approaches her, Yāj. II. 290 declares that he would be liable to be fined in the same amount as if he approached an avaruddha dasi or bhujiṣyā, because being in the keeping of another at the time she would be like a wife ( as the other two classes do ) so far as punishment for approaching a kept woman is concerned.

of women at all. The Mit: here defines 'avaruddha dasl' as "a slave woman who is prohibited by her master from intercourse with other men with an order to stay in the master's house alone in order that there may be no loss of attendance ( on the mas ter )." The Mit. defines a bhujisyū dāsi as one who is restricted (as to enjoyment) to certain definite males' (purusaniyata-pari grahā bhujisyah ). 1595 It is worthy of note that the Mit. employs different phraseology in defining the two words. In defining a bhujisyā it employs the word 'niyata', which generally means 'fixed or definite', while in defining 'avaruddha' it employs the word 'niruddhaḥ' meaning "prevented or prohibited'. If the two words were intended to convey the same meaning, there is no reason why the Mit. should not have employed the same word (niruddha) in defining a bhujisya. The difference between an avaruddhā dāsi and a bhujisya is that the former is ordered to stay in the master's house, while the bhujisya is not 80 ordered and secondly the avaruddha is forbidden to have sexual intercourse with any one except the master, while the bhujiṣyā is not so forbidden, but she is to restrict herself to 

enjoyment by certain specified males ( friends or men of the master's family ) and not necessarily by the master alone, This is the meaning assigned to those words by Mitramitra in his commentary 1596 (not his digest) on Yāj. II. 290. The Mit. itself indicates the meaning of 'niyata'by saying elsewhere that owner ship springs from certain fixed sources (niyatopāyakain svatram on Yaj. II. 114). It is respectfully submitted that the Privy Council gave a wrong interpretation of the word 'avaruddha' in Bai Nugubai vi Bai Monghibai 1597. Though slavery is now abolished in India there is no reason why the two characteris tics of avaruddha (viz, staying in the master's house and being

exclusively kept by the master) stated by the Lit. should not have been strictly adhered to by the Privy Council, particularly when they were holding heirs liable for the maintenance of kept mistresses, which is hardly ever allowed in any other system of law. With the greatest respect to the Full Bench, it must be said they went wrong in holding that bhujisyā means *a mistress who is restrained from intercourse with other per sons (other than the master)' and in holding that the only distinction between an araruddhā and a bhujisyā is that the former is required to stay in the house of the paramour, while the latter is not ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 13 and 22). The learned judges have not correctly interpreted the word 'niyata' and also the explanation of 'bhujigya' given by the Balambhatti 1598. The meaning of the Bālambhatti was misunderstood on account of the wrong meaning attached to the word 'niyata'. What the Balambhatti means in explaining the definition of bhujiaya is 'one who is to be enjoyed by certain definite males only other than the master (i. e. by the master and also certain defined males) and it does not mean 'who is forbidden to be enjoyed by males other than the master'. 

The F. B. further rely upon a passage of the Mit. in support of their conclusion ( 47 Bom. L. R. at pp. 14 and 22). On the question of what properties are impartible, the Mit. on Yāj. II. 119 quotes Manu IX. 219 viz. 'clothes, conveyances, ornaments, cooked food, water (wells &c.), women, yogakṣema and pastures (or ways)--these they der are are impartible.'The Mit. explanation1599 of the word ' striyah 'may be translated as follows: *striyah' here means 'fomaie slaves ; if they are uneven in number they should not be divided by taking their price into consideration, but they are to be made to work in turns (for the separated members of the family ), but as regards women kept by the father such as svairinis and the rest, they are not to be divided by the sons even though they be even in number". It is difficult to see how this passage supports the Full Bench decision. That

Meaning of avaruddha 

815 

passage can be explained in two or three different ways. In the first place, the Mit. having itself clearly distinguished and defined three classes, viz. avaruddha, bhujigya and svairinis ( together with vośyas also ) it cannot be lightly supposed that elsewhere it gives up that distinction. Therefore it would be difficult to say that here ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) the Mit, means that svairinis are also the same as avaruddhās. Hence the inter pretation should be that women who are avaruddha ( kept exclusively by the father) and even other women also like svairipis ( who had sexual connection with the father though not as avaruddhā ) should not be divided i. e. a 'ca' should be understood after 'svairinyadyah'. Or it is possible to hold that the word ' avaruddha ' in that passage is not employed in the strict technical sense (as defined by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 290 ). but in its etymological sense meaning 'women who are svairinis and the like that are taken into his harem (or under his protec tion ) by the father should not be divided'. This interpretation derives support from the explanation offered by the Subodhini (which is repeated almost verbatim by the Balambhatti ) about the text of Gautama quoted by the Mit. that 'gamyukta' in Gaut. means 'enjoyed' or 'confined' (in the house ). This shows that the words 'ruddha' and 'avaruddha' were used in the etýmological sense be distinguished writers. The Sm. C. II. p. 321 while explaining the word ' ruddha' in Manu IX. 12 applied to a wife guilty of adultery explains it as mean ing 'confined in a part of the house (grhe avaruddhām). When the Mit. states (p. 811) that the verses of Nār, and Kat. refer to avaruddhā stri it follows that these verses do not refer to bhujisyā, who would therefore be deemed not entitled to maintenance at all.

These are not quite germane to thọ present. volume, particularly because most of the decisions on these

(Vol. 

matters are not based on the words of the smṛtis or of the medieval digests, but are based on logic and principles of justice and equity. But there is one matter which deserves & passing reference. Ancient Hindu Law, attached the highest spiritual importance to the payment of debts ( vide pp. 414-417 above ). Therefore debts contracted by a Hindu are held by the Courts to take precedence over the right of maintenance of a man's wife, his infant child or his widow after his death. 1600 Similarly debts contracted by the manager of the joint family of which the widow's husband was a member would take precedence over the widow's right of maintenance, provided the debts were for the benefit of the family or were for legal necessity. 

The last vyauhārapadu is prakirnalca, which is defined by Visṇu Dh. S. 42. 1 as 'miscellaneous' (yadanuktam tat pra kirṇakam ) or by Nār. as matters that were to be set in motion by the king himself (vide note 331 ). These have been dealt with above and do not require any further treatment here. 

At the end of this section ou Vyavahāra it would not be out of place to say a few words about wille. Owing to the joint family system and the custom of adoption testamentary dis positions did not come into vogue in ancient India. Among the many kinds of documents (lekhya) mentioned by Kaut., Bṛ., Kāt. and others cited above there is no term for a document which can convey the idea of a modern will. But it need not be supposed that the idea had not at all dawned upon the minds of people before the advent of the British 1601 Wills were known among Mahomedans and contact with them would naturally suggest the idea of a will. Oral or written instructions by a man expecting death to his heirs intended to affect the disposal of his property must have been given occasionally and should not

be supposed to have been entirely unknown. Verses 341-359 of the Rajatarangipi IV. appear to embody the political testament of king Lalitāditya of Kashmir in the first half of the 8th century. Kat. (566) makes a very near approach to the modern conception of a will 1602. He says, 'if a gift was promised by a man for a religious purpose whether when in good health or when afflicted with disease, the son should be made to pay it, if the father dies without giving it over.' Here the mere declara-. tion of the intention of a person was made enforceable after his death against the son or other heir. Bphaspati's verse saying that a promise or direction to take effect after the death of the promisor was not ordinarily enforceable has already been quoted above (n. 823 ). In the quarterly of the Bhārata-itihāsa. samsodhaka Mandala of Poona, vol. XX p. 210 (for May 1940 ) there is a letter ( dated 1775 A. D.) written by one Naro Babaji, who, after referring to his illness, provides on a generous scale for his funeral and sraddha expenses and makes dispositions in favour of his daughter-in-law, of another widow, and for the marriage of his kingman's sons and distribution of the balance

[ Vol. 

One of the earliest wills to come before the British Indian Courts was that of the notorious Umichand 1605 (who died in. 1758 A. D.). Bengal Regulation XI of 1793 recognized by section VI the power of a Hindu proprietor to make a will or declaration giving, prior or subsequent to 1st July 1794, his entire landed estate to his eldest son or next heir or other son or heir or to any person or persons. In a Bombay case the will of a Hindu nmade in 1789 is referred to 1605. A Pundit of the Recorder's court of Bombay gave it as his opinion in 1812 A.D., there is no mention of wills in our Shaster; therefore they ought not to be made' ( vide Strange's Hinda Law, vol. II p. 449 ). In I. L. R. (1940) 1 Cal. 415 at p. 424 the Privy Council observe that the Hindu will in its present form is a developnient since the middle of the 18th century. 

. It is beyond the scope of this work to dilate on the modern Acts dealing with Testamentary dispositions such as the Indian Succession Act (Act 39 of 1925 ). 

Now that the foregoing lengthy presentation of the ancient and medieval Hindu judicial procedure and substantive law has been brought to a close a few general observations may be indulged in here. The Hindu Law of pleading and evidence compares favourably with similar laws of many other countries and has extorted the admiration and encomiums of such

eminent Jurists and Judges as Sir William Jones, Sir Thomas Strange and others. For example, Sir Thomas Strange in * Hindu Law '(1830) vol. I observes ( at p. 311), "sufficient be it to observe that Hindu pleading was noticed with commendation by Sir William Jones and that, with some trifling exceptions, the Hindu doctrine of evidence is, for the most part, distin guished nearly as much as our own, by the excellent sense that determines the competency and designates the choice of wit nesses with the manner of examining and the credit to be given them; as well as by the solemn earnestness with which the obligation of truth is urged and inculcated; insomuch that less cannot be said of this part of their law than that it will be read by every English lawyer with a mixture of admiration and delight, as it may be studied by him to advantage. Even the pious perjury which it has been supposed to sanction1605a being resolvable after all into no greater liberty than what our juries (not indeed with perfect approbation) have long been allowed to take, where the life of a prisoner on trial before them is at stake; credit is to be given to the pregnant brevity of the Hindu oath yiz.'what you know... declare at large and with truth'(Manu VIII. 80 ); as also to the noble warning, with which the subject as detailed by Manu is ushered in, that'either the court must not be entered by judges, parties and witnesses or law and truth must be openly declared' (Manu VIII. 13 )." The medieval digests made a very near approach to the modern ideal of equality of all men before the law. How even in the 20th century the much vaunted equality before the law of all people in England is far from being achieved and how it often proves quite illusory where the poor or the labouring classes are concerned is well brought out in a book entitled 'Justice in England' by a Barrister published by Victor Gollancz in 1938, especially in chapters I and VI. The Hindu jurists evolved tolerably clear and sound ideas about contracts, debts, deposits and pledges, sales, mortgages and gifts of immovable properties, developed a system of joint fanily rights and liabilities and laid down a peculiar law of inheritance and succession to males and females. The Hindu* system of inheritance and succession

pursues a middle course. It does not distribute the estate of a deceased person simultaneously among several heirs as under the Mahomedan Law (where the widow, the father, mother, song and daughters of a man take the estate together if they are all alive at the time). Nor did the Hindu system confine the descent to a single person among a group of heirs of the same degree and sex as in the English system before 1926 ( where the eldest son succeeded to the real estate of an intestate person). 

It has further been seen how the ancient and medieval Hindu rules as to debts, adoption, partition and inheritance have been moulded for over a century by Legislation and by decisions of the Privy Council and the Courts in India. Many persons feel that the time has now arrived for the codification of Hindu Law. A Committee presided over by Sir B. N. Rau has prepared a draft code which attempts to codify certain branches of Hindu Law. From several quarters there has been vehement opposition to this draft code. The objections raised are many. It is not possible to deal here with the several objections in detail. But some of them which raise questions of fundamental importance will have to be briefly stated and answered. The first objection is that in view of Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858 the Indian Legislature should not interfere with the oustoms and usages of the people that are part and parcel of the Hindu religious system. But this objection is hollow and unsubstantial and conveniently ignores what has happened during the last hundred years or so. All that the Queen pro claimed was: 'Firmly relying ourselves on the truth of Christianity and aoknowledging with gratitude the solace of religion we disclaim alike the right and the desire to impose our convictions on any of our subjects. We desire it to be our royal will and pleasure that none be in any wise favoured, none molested or disquieted by reason of their religious faith or observances; but that all shall alike enjoy the equal and impartial protection of the law; and we do strictly charge and enjoin all those who may be in authority under us that they abstain from all interference with the religious belief or worship of any of our subjects on pain of our highest displeasure.' Not withstanding the noble sentiments expresged here, the Indian Legislature both before and after the proolamation passed numerous laws that more or less impinged upon or affected the religious theories, sentiments and practices of millions of Hindus! The following is a list of some of the important laws of this character which will convince any one of the fact that

Laws affecting ancient Hindu practices 

821 

people have always submitted to laws passed by the Governor General or the Legislature that prevented them from carrying out their cherished ideas and practices : Regulation XVII of 1829 which declared the practice of Sati illegal and a crime punishable by the courts; the Caste Disabilities Removal Act (XXI of 1850 ); Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act ( XV of 1856, which legalises the marriages of Hindu widows notwithstanding any custom or interpretation of the Hindu Law to the contrary); the Indian Penal Code (XLV of 1860, which makes sexual inter course by a man with his own wife that is under thirteen years of age punishable as rape ); the Child Marriage Restraint Act (XIX of 1929), which makes the marriage of a male below 18 and of a female below 14 punishable as a crime; the Hindu Inheri tance (Removal of Disabilities) Act (XII of 1928) which sets aside the Mitākṣarā rules about exclusion from partition and inherit ance except in the case of those that have been lunatics or idiots from birth; the Hindu Law of Inheritance Amendment Act ( II of 1929, which enables the son's daughter, daughter's daughter, sister and sister's son to succeed under the Mitākṣarā in that order after the paternal grandfather and before & father's brother); the Hindu Gains of Learning Act ( XXX of 1930 ); the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act (XVIII of 1937, which enables the widow of a deceased member of a joint Hindu family to succeed to the interest of her husband in the joint family property and to succeed to her deceased husband's separate property for the same share as that of a son). The Privy Council claimed more than 70 years ago that the British Government by virtue of its sovereign power asserted, as the former rulers of the country had done, the right to visit endowments of this kind ( viz. temples) and to provent and redress abuses in their management' ( Rajah Muttu Ramalinga v. Perianayagum 1 1. A. 209 at p. 232 ). Non-Hindu Judges of the Privy Council and the High Courts have been interpreting and laying down the Hindu Law for over a hundred years and on many points the law declared by them has thoroughly changed the law of the smrtis and digests. If all this has been allowed to happen without hardly & demur, there is apparently no satisfactory or convincing reason why an elected Indian Legisla ture the majority of whose members are likely to be Hindus should not pass an Aot dealing with Hindu Law. 

Another objection raised oven by some retired judges of the High Court is that the present system of laying down the822 

History of Dharmatāstra 

( Vol. 

Hindu Law by means of judicial decisions is quite satisfactory and there is no need of a code of Hindu Law. This objection merely shows that change is rather a painful process for most mon. The present method may be a veritable El Dorado or paradise for lawyers and busy bodies fonenting longdrawn litigations. One must stand appalled at the colossal expendi ture of time, labour and money which must have been involved during the last hundred years or more in fighting out doubtful points of Hindu Law from the lowest court to the Privy Council. It not unfrequently happens that after a point had been settled by a Full Bench decision of a High Court and after common people and lawyers had followed the law thus settled for fifty years the Privy Council upsets the decision on an appeal by an enterprising litigant. For example, the Bombay High Court decided in 1879 in Ramji 1. Ghamau (6 Bom. 498 ) that the adop tion by the widow of a deceased co-parcener, who had not her husband's express authority to adopt, was invalid, if made with out the consent of the surviving co-parceners. But in 1932 the Privy Council held that Ramji v. Ghamau was wrongly decided and that a widow can adopt without her husband's express authority and even in the teeth of the opposition of the sur viving members of her husband's family. And when an appeal was made to the principle of 'stare decisis' the Privy Council was pleased to observe, ' It was pressed on their Lordships that Ramji v. Ghamau had been accepted and acted upon in the Presidency of Bombay since 1879 and that the decision should not be disturbed. But this is a belated appeal. It should have been made when Yadav v. Namdeo was before the Board.' To ordinary minds this dictum, speaking with the utmost régpect, appears strange. If for some reason or other a certain line of argument is not placed before the Privy Council by the counsel of a private party and a wrong decision is given, is it to be supposed that all litigants are to be precluded from trying to get the wrong decision right for all time to come! The Privy Council has not seldom set right a wrong decision given by the Board in a prior appeal. In Sahu Ram v. Bhup Singh 44 I. A. 126 the Privy Council held that the pious duty of the son to discharge his father's or grandfather's debts does not attach while the father or grandfather is alive; but in Brý Narain v. Mangla Prasad 51 I. A. 129 the Privy Council held (at p. 134) that the pious duty is always there irrespective of the question whether the father or grandfather is alive or dead.

Draft Hindu code , 

823 

Others opine tbat one Code for the whole of India is not and cannot be a practicable proposition. In support of their objection they rely on the existence of the several schools of law now prevalent in the whole of India. If India desires to be a self-governing political unity in the future, there is a com pelling reason why it should be governed by a single Code of Hindu Law, as it has been gov erned and will be governed in other substantial provinces of law by codes applicable to all alike. That will help in the direction of solidarity and will be of some use in doing away with fissiparous tendencies. There are really only two schools of Hindu Law. And the unification of Hindu Law will be helped by the abolition of the right by birth which is the cornerstone of the Mitakṣarā school and which the draft Hindu Code seeks to abolish. Many people are vehemently opposed to the change. But they forget that: what with the rule that any member of a joint Hindu family may alienate his interest for value, what with the Gains of Learning Act, the Hindu Women's Rights to Property Act and other enactments, the real core of the ancient Hindu family system has been removed and only the outer moribund shell remains (vide p. 604 above). Some are opposed to giving along with sons a share to daughters, particularly to married daugh ters. But here a compromise may be effected by allowing a share to unmarried daughters alone (as Yāj. II. 124 and the Mitākṣarī thereon expressly provide ). 

Another provis ion in the draft Hindu Code which has come in for severa anim adversion is the provision that a woman even when taking by inheritance an estate from a male or by partition should be held to become absolute owner thereof. In the first place, if a man's agnate of the 13th degree or a male cognate up to the 5th degree takes an estate absolutely and may squander it away as he pleases, one fails to see why his own widow should not have a like power in the 20th century, what ever may have been the view of ancient works. In the second place, this objection can be met by means of a compromise, viz. that a widow inheriting her husband's estate will take only a limited estate if at the time of her husband's death any one of the compact series of heirs or any direct lineal descendant of her husband (such as a son's daughter or daughter's daughter) be alive, but she will take an absolute estate if none of these exists. Such a compromise should allay all fears about the widow unfairly disposing of the estate against near relations 

824

( Vol. 

like the daughter or daughter's son or husband's brother &c. There are numerous other objections, but they are in matters of detail and if once it is agreed that there should be a Code of Hindu Law passed by the Indian Legislature these matters of detail may be adjusted to the satisfaction of most people. 

Similarly serious objections are raised to the provisions of the Code as regards marriages and divorce. The draft code proposes to do away with the prohibitions based on sameness of gotra and pravara. This is a desirable change and being optional should not be opposed. Some reasons for this change have been advanced in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 498. Besides, this provision will affect only a small percentage of the Hindu popu. lation. Similarly the insistence on monogamy is opposed by many. In this case some compromise may be arrived at as regards classes to whom two wives are an economic advantage. The provisions about divorce have been overdue. Among the higher castes no divorce has been allowed on any ground what ever. Many hard cases occur where there is no redress and the draft code proposes to give relief in such cases. 

On the most contentious subject of adoption the draft code, it is satisfactory to note, has made certain provisions which are in line with the suggestions put forth by me in note 1338a above. 

Compelling reasons exist why Hindu Law should be codi fied as early as possible. Men naturally desire that they should have easy access to the laws by which they are to be governed in all their actions, dealings and relations. It is hardly a commendable or desirable state of things that-people should be forced to consult lawyers or bulky textbooks every now and then and even in small and simple matters. The general outlines and provisions of Hindu Law must be within easy reach of every intelligent or inquiring Hindu. This can only happen if there is a code for all Hindus or, if that is deemed impracticable for the present, at least for a large pro vince or for a number of provinces,
