SUDDHI

Suddhi (purification ) is a very comprehensive topic including within it purification after āśauca (impurity on birth and death), purification of a person after contact with an impure object or on account of certain occurrences, purification of pots, wells, food &c., after they are polluted. Āśauca, however, is the most important subject under śuddhi and therefore the Suddhi kaumudi defines "suddhi' as 'the state of being fit for or capable of performing the rites that are understood from the Veda 596 The Surtis employ the word suddhi in relation to purification after āśauca. For example, Manu V, 57 starts by saying that he will expound purification after a man is dead (pretasuddhi) and purification of things (dravyasuddhi). Manu V, 83 ( = Daksa VI, 7) avers that a brahmana becomes pure after ten days (on the death or birth of a relative ), a ksatriya after twelve &o, The Parāśara-smrti starts chapter three by declaring 'I shall expound suddhi on birth and death.' Yaj. III, 14, 25 also employ the word suddhi. Therefore aśauca on birth and death will be first dealt with. 

The word āśauca is formed from suci (pure) according to Pāp. V. 1.131 596a and Pān. VII. 3. 30 (vide note below) with the negative particle na (a). In some smrtis such as that of Devala the form āśucya' also is found (soe Hāralatā pp. 2, 9, 36 in quotations from Devala 5968). Another word which is often used as a synonym for āśauca is 'agha'. It has been seen above (p.6) that the word agha means 'sin' in the Vedic Literature (as in Rg. I. 97. 1-8, X, 117.6). But in the San, Śr. IV, 15. 11,

[Vol. Manu v. 84 (na vardhayed-aghahāni) the word 'agha' has come to mean the same thing as āśauca. 597 The Padmapurāna II. 66. 73-74 states that since the outlets of the body always einit muous, urine &c, it is always impuro, 

The Mit, on Yāj. III 1 defines 59s āśauca as an emergent attribute attaching to a person, which is got rid of by lapso of time or a bath and the like and which is the cause of the positive direction to offer (to a deceased person) pinda, water and the like and of the cessation of Vedic study and other actions The Mit adds that āśauca is not merely the absence of the privilege or power to do religious acts, since even those who have incurred impurity (on death &c ) are enjoined to do certain religious acts such as offering water ( to the deceased) This definition of the Mit appears to be an echo of the Garuda purana (pretakhanda) 5.9 and is probably based on a verse of the work called Sangraha. Haradatta 599 on Gautama 14. 1 states that aśauca may be defined as 'the absence of the privilege to perform religious acts, unfitness for baing ono whose food may be partaken of, untouchability and the loss of the privilege to make religious gifts.' A comparatively early writer Bhattācārya, 600 appears to have defined 'śuddhi' as the "removal of sin' or as 'being fit for performing religious acts.' This was accepted by the Sporti-candrika, but rejected by Nandapandita, commentator of Sadasiti (pp. 2-3) Even tho Mit. (on Yaj, III. 18) emphasizes that asauca has two characteristics, viz, it takes away the privilege of performing 

of the work asauca mascious acts, uhability and the costis

religious acts and it renders a person untouchable. The Smrtimuktāphala follows this. Rudradhara in his Suddhiviveka (D. O ns, No. 309 of 1887-91 folio 1 ) says that suddhi is a special attribute which brings about a capacity or privilege for the performance of a}} dharmas, while aśuddbi is an attribute opposed to suddhi-and arises on the occasion of the birth of a sapinda or the like. 602 

Aśauca is of two kinds, viz. that arising on birth 602 (and 80 called jananāsauca or sutaka) and that arising on death (and therefore called śārāśauca or motakāśauca or maranāśauca). śāva is derived from sava (meaning a corpse). The word sūtaka occurs in the 603 Ait. Br. (chap. 32.8) and is there probably used in the sense of impurity on both birth and death, There it is said that if an āhitāgni partook of food from the house of him who was affected by sūtaka, then the prāyaścitta was to offer a purodāsa cooked on eight potsherds to Agni Tantunat. Tantu means also 'son or progeny' and so it may ba argued that it is an indication that sūtaka is used in the Ait. Br. in the sense of impurity on birth. The word sūtaka is used in the smrtis in thres senses: (1) impurity on birth (vide Manu V.58); (2) impurity both on birth and death, as in Gobhilasmrti III:63 and 63; 604 (3) impurity on death alone (as in Daksa VI, 1 and Gobhilasmrtı III. 48) 605 In some of the modern vernaculars (such as Marathi) the word 'sūtaka' is used in the 3rd sense alone. In each of these two divisions there are two varieties viz, where the duration is brief or com paratively long (Şadaśiti, verse 2). 

A question arises why birth and death should cause in. purity to the members of the family or to relatives. Only a

[Vol, 

few have to say anything on this question, Harlta says: 'the family incurs death impurity because by death the family faels overwhelmed (or frustrated), while when a new life appears the family increases (and there is gratification or joy)' 505, 

The literature on Suddhi (including aśauca) is very exten sive. Apart from the sūtras, smrtis and Purāṇas there are numerous digests dealing with the subject at great length. Some of them have been printed. The smrtis contain a mass of contradictory dicta to such an extant and different from the Usages of medieral times that the Mit on Yāj II. 22 after quoting the views of Parāśara, Sātātapa, Vasistha and Angiras on the periods for Thich impurity had to be observed by per sons belonging to the four Farnas refuses to evolve order out of then and remarks that the asages in its day were diffe rent from the dicta of those sages 607. The Madana-pārijāta (p 392) agrees with the Mit and also suggests other modes of dealing with the conflict. To examples may be cited of the way in which different smrtis approach the same problem, Atri 83, Parāśara III 5 and Daksa VI. 6 provide that a brāhmada who has congecrated the three Vedic fires and bas mastered the Veda becomes free from impurity (on birth and death) in one day, one who has merely mastered the Veda ( but has not consecrated the srauta fires) in three days and one who is devoid of both in ten dars. Manu v.59 gires various options viz 10 days, 4 days, 3 days, 1 day but does not state explicitly to whom his remarks apply. Brhaspatiala.

Conflict of smrtis on asauca 

by Hāralatā p. 5 and Haradatta on Gautana 14. 1) states that a brahmana who is endoged with Veda and śrauta fires becomes pure after three days, one who is devoid of srauta fires ( but is master of the Veda) in five days and one who is only a brahmana by caste (has not studied the Veda or does not teach it) in ten days. The San Sr. and Manu 608 (both quoted above) urge a man not to increase through laziness the qumber of days for which impurity is to be observed. It is possible that persons claiming to be learned observed impurity for a few days only, while neighbours disputed their claim to this special dispensation in favour of Vedic learning and keeping śrauta fires. The result was that later on a flat pumber of ten days was prescribed for all biāhmaṇas whether learned or not and the provision for losser number of days of impurity was relegated to Kalvariya usages. Vide H, of Dh. vol. III, pp. 941-42.

Another example of the dependence of the days of impurity on the caste of the deceased and of varying dicta thereon may be cited, Manu V. 83, Daksa VI 7, Yāj III, 22, Atri (verse 85), Saṅkha (15.2-3), Matsyapurāna (18. 2-3), Brahmapurapa 220. 63, Visnu Dh, S 22. 1-4, all lay down periods of 10 days, 12 days, 15 days and a month for impurity among brāhmadas, ksatriyas, vaiśyas and sūdras respectively. Yaj. III, 22 makes the virtuous śūdra observe impurity only for 15 days as a concession, Gaut. (15.1-4) prescribas 10, 11, 12 days (or half month) and a month respectively for the four vargas, while Vas. (4.27-30) gives the periods of 10, 15, 20 and one month for the four varnas. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar, in his article on Nāgara brāhmavas and Kayasthas of Bengal, protests that the Kayasthas of Bengal (owing to social tyranny) sti]] obserye āśauca for one month as if they are ordinary śūdras (I. A. for 1932 at P.71), On the other hand, Angiras ( quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. 11. 22) states that śātātapa declared that all varnas become purified after ten days whether the impurity is due to birth or death,609 Parāśara (III, 9) quoted by the Mit. on Yāj.

History of Dharnatāstra 

(Vol. 

provides that a sapinda who is 4th in descent from the cominon ancestor of the deceased and himself becomes pure after ten days, one who is 5th after 6 days, one who is 6th in descent after four days and one who is 7th after one day. The Mita says that this should be discarded as it is in conflict with many other smortis and is disapproved of by people, 610 Some of the rules mentioned by Vijñanesvara (about 1100 AD) themselves underwent changes in 500 years as noted by the Nirdayasindhu (composed in 1612 A. D. 611). 

The Mit. on Yāj III, 18 declares that when a child that has not conipleted two years dies, it is the parents that have to observe aśauca for ten days and not all sapipdas and that their aśauca entails untouchability for them. The Nirdayasindhu (p. 517) remarks that what Vijñāneśyara said is not nov (in its time) the usage and that the Surtyarthasāra also did not accept Vijñānośyara's view. 

In view of the above-mentioned circumstances no useful purpose would be served by setting out in detail the varying diota of the smrtis, Puranas 612 and the digests upon the several matters that fall to be treated under aśauca, Digests on this subject are too numerous to mention. The following printed ones and a few miss have been made use of in preparing the following account. In the first place, there are several works that deal with this subject in verse. The Asaucāstaka aftri buted to Vararuci (published in the Trivandrum series) with &

commentary by an anonymous writer that names the bhāsya of Maskarin on Gautama-dharmasūtra (on p. 35) deals with the subject in eight sragdharā verses. The Aśaucadaśaka or Daśaślokī attributed to Vijñāneśvara seems to have been a very popular work. There are several commentaries on it. The ons by Harihara is the earliest of them. In the Deccan College collection of Mss (now at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona) there are several Mss of it, two of which were copied in sainvat 1539 (D. C. No. 216 of 1879-80) and sarvat 1579 (D.O.No 196 of 1884-87) and which expressly state that the work was composed by Vijñāneśvara-yogIndra, The ton Śārdūla vikridita verses of the Asaucadaśaka are set out in the appendix. The Kalpataru of Laksmidhara has a section on śuddhi which has been recently published in the G.O.S. The Hāralatā of Aniruddha is very useful (B. I Series). The Āśaucakānda of the Smrticandrikā has been edited by the lata Dr. Shamsastry and published as No. 56 of the Mysore University Sanskrit publica tions, The Trimsacchloki with the commentary of Raghunatha composed in sake 1645 has been published at the Poona Ananda śrama press and contains 30 Sragdharā verses on āśauca. The Şadasiti (86 verses in the Apustubh metre ) of Kausikāditya with the commentary Suddhicandrikā by Vināyaka alias Nanda pandita (composed about 1600 A. D.) has been published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The Suddhikaumudi of Govinda nanda (B. L Series ); the Suddhitattva of Raghunandana (ed. by Jivananda pp. 233-412), the Suddhiprakasa (part of the Viramitrodaya of Mitramiśra ) published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series, the Suddhimayūkha of Nilakantha ( edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) and the Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanatha (edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) are compilations that are useful in their own way. These exhaustive treatises on āśauca show one thing unmistakably that brāhmanas of the medieval ages attached an extremely exaggerated importance to ceremonial purity of tbe body on birth and death. 

The periods of impurity depended on many circumstances, There was a difference between impurity on birth and that on death; so also the duration depended upon whether the deceased was an infant or a male or a female or one whose upanayang had been performed or not performed; it depended on oaste and also on the question whether the deceased died near the relative or far away; also upon the degree of relationship; and on the time that elapsed from the birth or death till it reached the ears'

of the relative. The intensity of impurity was different in each of the following: a sūtikā (a freshly delivered woman), rajasvalā (woman in montbly illness ), impurity od death, impurity on birth (the last being the least ). 

Daksa (VI 2-3) states that there are ten varieties in impurity, viz. immediate purity (after taking a bath ), one day, three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fort. night, a month and till the end of one's life 613 Daksa then explains in what cases these different periods apply. As to what is meant by impurity till life's end (lit till he is reduced to ashes), Daksa ( VI 8–10 ) says. 'those who take their meala without bathing or offering to gods or without making gifts all such persons are in impurity till life ends. One who is permanently aftlicted with a disease, who is close-fisted (1.0, stints himself, wife and son and religious acts through greed), who is always in debt (1, e. who has not paid off his debts to gods, sages and manes), who is bereft of religious acts (nitya or namitzka ), who is a fool and is under the thumb of his wife, whose mind is bent on vices (gambling, prostitution &c ), who is always dependent (a king's servant or the like ), who is devoid of faith and benevolence (charitable gifts )--he incurs impurity which ends only with his ashes (i e, only when he is cremated). 614 These words are not to be taken literally; What is meant is that such a man is to be shunned by others (i s it is an arthavāda correying merely censure) 

We shall now turn to the impurity on birth. 

That the impurity on birth lasted for ten days even in Vedic times can be inferred from the story of Sunah-sep8 narrated in the Ait Br (chapter 33 %), where occurs the passage when the animal is more than ten days from birth he becomes pure (and fit to be offered in sacrifice)* The same

Impurity on birth 

inference can probably be drawn from Tai. Br. I, 1 1.3, where it is said 'therefore people do not take the milk of a cow for ten nights when a calf is born.' 635 

Abortion in the first four months 616 of pregnancy is called srāva, abortion in the 5th or 6th month is called pata and from the 7th month of pregnancy onwards it is called prasūtz or prasaia (according to Parāśara IL 16, Sadaśiti verse 9). When there is srāva the mother incurs impurity for three days, in the case of pāta the mother has to observe impurity for as many days as correspond to the months of pregnancy (i, e, 5 days or 6 days). The impurity consists in the mother being untouchable. The father alone has to bathe when there is stāva, but when there is pāla the father and sapindas have to observe impurity for three days ( according to Madana-pārijāta p. 380-381 and others) but they don't incur impurity as on death. These rules hold good for all castes. But when the foetus comes out dead in any month from the 7th or the child is still-born, then the impurity is for tan days for both parents and the sapindas for all varnas or for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varpas as laid down in Yāj. (III. 22 ) and the samānodakas have to obserye aśauca for three days and sagotras for one day (Dharmasindhu p. 427). The above rules are more or less laid down by Gautama 14. 15–16, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 136, Parāśara II, 24, Manu V. 66, Yāj. II. 20 (latter half) and the first verse of Aśaucadaśaka. The mother is untouchable for ten days on .birth, still-birth or abortion in 7th, 8th or 9th month but the father and sapindas 617 when they take a bath after the prasava are not untouchable ( Yaj. III, 19 ). In ancient times there were several differing vievs about jananāsauca for the father as vouched for by Baud,618 Dh. S. I 5 125–128. Although a woman

Even when sagotras have to observe aśauca on birth they are not untouchable (Şadasiti Verse 6 ). 

It would be better to state here certain general rules once for all. When any text employs the word day (ahah) or night (ratra) in prescribing the duration of āśauca what is meant is ahorūtia (both day 622 and night). When counting the days of aśauca one has to begin from the day of the cremation, if the deceased was an āhetāgnz, but from the day of death in the case of one not an āhtāgnz 623 (Āśauca-dasaka verse 4, Kūrma, Uttarardha 23.52). Birth and death are causes of asauca only when they are known to the person who is to be affected by it and dot by the mere fact of the birth or death. This follows from certain

General rules about asauca 

277 

passages of Pāraskara gr. III. 10 and Manu V. 75-76 and the Brahmapurāna, Pāraskara (III. 10) provides : 624 'if one who had gone abroad dies, (his relatives) should on hearing (of his death) sit down and offer him water and should remain untouchable for the days that remain out of the proper period (viz. 10, 1%, 15, 30 days); if the prescribed period (of āśauca ) has expired they should observe asauca for one night or three nights,' Manu (V. 75-76) is to the same effect, The Brahmapurana states : 'if a donor makes & gift and the acceptor accepts it when both are pot aware of there being a birth or death in their family, no blame attaches.' 

We should now turn to āśauca on death. Here again there is no unanimity and therefore the views perferably of the latest works (such as the Dharmasindhu) will be set out after referring to a few smrti passages, Āsauca on death randers those who jncur it untouchable and unable to perform religious rites. Pār. gr. III. 10. 29-30 (S. B. E. YO), 29 p. 357) statad gene rally that the impurity caused by death lasts through thres nights and that according to some teachers through ten nights, If a child dies within ten days of birth, the father and mother have to obserye Jananāsauca and become purified by the end of the āśauca on birth and the father remains untouchable for those days (Kūrma-purāna q. by S. K. p 21). If a child died before it struck teath the sapndas had only to undergo a bath, while the parents had to observe aśauca for three days if the child was a son and for one day if a daughter (vide Yāj. II. 23, Saṅkha 15, 4, Atri 95, Aśaucadaśaka verse 2). If the child died after striking teeth but before Cūda (or the end of the third year) the sapindas had to observe āśauca for one day and night (Yāj, IL 23, Saṅkha 15, 5), but the parents had āsauca (of death) for three days. If the child was & girl the sapindas became pure by & bath up to the girl's third year. If death occurs between Cūdā (or three years ) and ilpanayana or marriage (in the case of girls) the sapipdas including the father have to observe āśauca for three days and samāpodakas become purified by a bath alone After upa nayapa all sapindas have to observe āśauca (on death) for ten days (Gaut. 14 1, Manu V. 59, Asaucadaśaka 2) and all samānodakas for three days. In the case of a śūdra dying

· History of Dharmasastra 

(Voi. 

after three and before marriage or 16 years the aśauca is three days for all sapindas. After sixteen years or marriage (in the case of a sudra) it is the āśauca prescribed for his caste, In the case of a girl dying after three years and before vāgdāna (betrothal) the parents have asauca for three days and the sapindas ( up to three generations) one day. If a girl dies after vāgdāna and before marriage the sapindas of her father as well as of the proposed bridegroom had to obserye āśauta for three days. In the case of women and gūdras if death takes place after marriage or after 16 years (if the Sūdra was unmarried) the period of āśauca for all sapindas is ten days. If a woman dies at her father's house after marriage, her parents, step-mother, full brothers and step-brothers liave to observe āśauca for three days and her paternal unole and the like that stay in the same house with her father for one day. Some say that if the married daughter dies in a village other than that of the father, the parents have to observe āśauca for a paksini 625 (1. e, two nights with a day between or two days with a night between). There are other views on this point which are passed over. For example, Visdu-dharmagūtra (22. 32-34) says that in the case of a married woman there is no āśauca on the parents' side; but when she is delivered of a child or dies in the father's house then the impurity is for one day or three days respectively. 626 A married woman has to observe asauca for three days for the death of her parents or step-mother if ten days have not elapsed from the day of death or for the remaining days out of the period of ten (Yā). III. 21 latter half). If the married daughter hears of the death of the parents or step-mother at a time more than ten days after the death or within one year she has to observe āśauca for a paksid), If a brother whose upadsyana has been performed dies at his married sister's house or vice versa, aśauca has to Le observed for three days by them, but it they do not die at each other's house but in a different one

Rules about asauca on death 

then the aśauca is for & paksins and if the death occurs in another village then there is aśauca only for one day. The same rules apply to step-brothers and step-sisters and also among sisters. A married woman on the death of her paternal grand-father or paternal uncle kas to undergo only a bath. If a maternal uncle dies, the nephew and the piece have to observe aśauca for a paksini. If the maternal uncle dies in the house of the nephev then there is āśauca for three days and for only one day if the maternal uncle had not his upanayana performed or died in another village; the same rules apply to one's mother's step-brother. If the wife of a maternal uncle dies, the nephew of the niece of the maternal uncle have to undergo āśauca for a paksini If a nephew whose thread ceremony bas been performed dies, his maternal uncle and maternal aunt have āśauca for three days The same rules apply if the deceased be the son of a step-sister of the maternal uncle. If the niece (sister's daughter) dies there is only a bath for the maternal uncle. If a maternal grandfather dies, the grandchild (the son or daughter of a daughter) has to observe asauca for three days, but only for a paksini if the maternal grandfather dies in a different village. On the death of the maternal grand mother the grandchildren have to observe āśauca for a paksini, Some works do not prescribe āśauca for a female descendant such as a niece or grand-daughter. If a daughter's son, whose upanayana had been performed, died, the maternal grandfather and grandmother had to observe āśauca for three days and for paksipi if the daughter's son had not upanayana performed for him. On the death of a daughter's daughter the maternal grandfather and mother incur no āśauca In all these matters tha general rule is that a male whose upanayana had been performed and a married woman alone are liable to undergo āśauca for any relative other than the parents (i e, on the death of a parent a 'male though without upanayana and a roman though unmarried are liable to undergo āśauca). 

If a man's father-in-law or mother-in-law die near (in the house of) the man, he has to undergo āśavca for three days, but op]y for paksind if the death is elsewhere than with the son-in lar. On the death of & son-in-law, the father-in-law and the mother-in-law have to observe āśauca for one day or they have only to take a bath, but if the son-in-law dies in the house of the father-in-law then the āśauca is for three days. On the death of one's wife's brother, the asauca is for one day i

upanayana had been performed; but if no upanayana was performed or if he died in another village a mere bath is enough, 

On the death of one's mother's sisters (full or half ) the person (whether man or woman) has to undergo aśauca for a paksini; the same rule applies on the death of the father's sister. If it is a step-sister of the father then a mere bath 19 enough. The father's sister has to undergo a bath if the nephew dies If one's father's sister or mother's sister dies in one's house then the aśauca is for three days. 

In the case of "bandhus (described by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 135 as bhinnagotra sapindas) of 627 the three kinds, the aśauca is for a paksidl, provided the bandhu is upanita but if he died before upanayana then āśauca is for one day and if the bandbu died in one's house then for three days If the daughter of the father's sister (and of the other bandhus enu merated in the three verses) dies married, the asauca is one day, but if they die unmarried only a bath is necessary. Among the three kinds of babdhus, a man himself and his three atmabandhus have to observe āśauca for each other's death; but the case is different as to potrbandhus and mātou bandhus. If any one of these latter dies, there is āśauca for the man whose bandhus they are, but if a man dies, h78 pitr bandhus and nātrbandhus have to observe no āśauca. 

If an adopted son dies, his natural father and adoptive father have to observe āśauca for three days (the Vyavahāra mayūkha differs from this ) and the sapindas for one day. 

If the adoptive or natural father dies, the adopted son has to observe āśauca for three days and for one day for the sapindas of any one of them. On the death of the son and the grandson of an adopted son, the sapindas of the natural father and the adoptive father bave to observe āśauca for one day and

Aśauca in case of adoption

vice versa. These rules apply if the son adopted is not a sapinda or samanodaka of the adopter, when he was in his family of birth. But if a Bagotra sapinda or a samanodaka be adopted, then the āśauca is for ten or three days respectively. 

ha Gautama se ho sbanca te for me 

If one's ācārya 628 dies, the pupil has to observe āśauca for three days, but only one day if he dies in another village (Gautama 14. 26, 5%, Manu V. 80). On the death of the acārya's Wife or son the asauca is for one day. 629 On the death of a guru (who instructs in Vedic mantras) the āśauca is three days and paksini if he dies in another village. On the death of a teacher who imparted instruction in grammar, astronomy and other angas (subsidiary lores) of the Veda, the asauca is one day. Similar rules are laid down about the death of a pupil, riurk (sacrificial priest), a sacrificer, a dependent śrotriya, a fellow-student, a friend, which are all passed over as not now useful Vide Gaut, 14, 19-20 (which prescribe one day's āśauca on the death of a fellow-student or a dependent grotriya). 

These provisions about aśauca on the death of the acārya and rtvik who were not sapindas show how closely the bond between teacher and pupil was thought to be in ancient times, almost equalling the tie of blood. When a yati (ascetic) dios, 630 all his sapindas have simply to undergo a bath (and nothing more). Conversely, a yati and brahmacārin have to observe no āśauca Manu V. 8%, Yāj III. 25, Visnu 22.45, Saṅkha 15. 15 provide that on the death of the ruler of the country in which one resides one has to observe āśauca up till 

628. An acārya is defined by Manu II. 140 as one who performs the upadayada of his pupil and teaches him the Veda together with the Kalpasūtra and Vpadisads, Rtvik is defined by Manu II. 143 as one who is chosen for the performance of Agayādbeya, the pākayajñas and the soleme sacrifices like Agaistoma.

The ideas of ritualistic purity went so far as to provido (as stated in the Suddhitattva quoted by the Nirnayasındhu) that if a dog died in a brāhmana's house the house became impure for ten days, that, if a śūdra, 633 a patita or a mloccha died in a brālimana's house, the house became impure for a month, two months or four months respectively and the houso had to be abandoned if a svapāka died therein

that, if a person stays in a different country and hears of a birth or death among his sapindas, he has to observe āśauca not for ten days after hearing but for that number of days that ara short of the ten days (counting from birth or death) pre scribed for sapindas. Vide Manu V. 75, Yāj II. 21 (latter half), Saṅkha 15.11, Pār. gr III. 10 Aśauca interferes very much with one's activities and it is hence that often-tinies people send a closed letter to their relatives living in a different place stating thereon that it be opened on a partioular day (which is the 10th day from the death of a sapinda). Every one knows the meaning of such a direction and by such a subterfuge inconvenience is avoided and the dictates of the śāstra are deemed to be satisfied. If a son hears of the death of a parent be bas to observe āśauoa for ten days from the day of hearing, but if he hears of the death of a parent before the collection of bones then he has to observe aśauca only for the days that remain (Smrti-muktāphala p. 534). There is great divergence about the period of aśauca if the death of a sapinda comes to one's ears more than ten days after the day of death. Manu V. 77 provides that on hearing of the death of a sapinda or the birth of a son after ten days (from the event) a man be comes pure after plunging into water with the clothes on and Yaj II 21 (last pāda, 'pūrne dattyodakam suciḥ') states that he becomes pure after (a bath and) offering water when the period fixed has passed off. From the words of Manu that only the father, even if he hears of the birth of a son more than ten days after the event, has to take a bath the Mit infers that there is no atikrāntāsauca for sapindas on birth 635. The Mit. quotes Devala in support (vide note 621 above). The Dharma sindhu follows the Mit. Manu V. 76, Saṅkha 15.12, Kūrma purāna (Uttarārdha) 23,21 state that when ten days have passed after the event of death, the man who hears of the death is impure for three days and if he hears of the death more than a year after death, he becomes pure after a bath. In order to remove the conflict among smrtis Yrdaha-Vasistha lays doira 'āśauca is for three days if the news of death is heard within three months (but later than ten days after death), for & paksipi if it is heard within six months (but later than

[Vol. three months), for one day if heard before nine months (but later than 6 months ) and thereafter (i. e. up to one year but later than nine months) one becomes pure by a bath. But the Mit, says 636 that this holds good as to all except one's parents and quotes Paithinasi and another smrti for the proposition that whenever a son staying in a distant country hears of the death of & parent whether within a year or after a year he has to observe aśauca for ten days from the day he becomes aware of it. Laghu-Āśvalayada (20.88) lays down the same exception in the case of a son. The Mit. (on Yāj, I, 21 last half) further says that the rules about atıkrāntaśauca apply only to a deceased person whose upanayana had been performed. The Dharmasindhu ( 433 ) remarks that there is no atikrāntāśauca as regards the periods of one day and three days prescribed on the death of one whose upanayana bad not been performed or as regards the periods of paksini and "hres days on the death of the maternal uncle and others of a different gotra. Similarly, there is no atikrāntāśaucs with reference to the asauca for three days prescribed in the case of samanodakas; but in these cases even after the lapse of the fixed time a bath is necessary. The rules about atkı āntasauca apply only to aśauoa on death for ten days. As in the case of the son, so in the cases of husband and wife and of co-wives among themselves even after the lapse of more than a year and even if the death is in a different country the husband or wifo or co-wife has to observe āśauca for ten days Tho paronts, avea when they hear of the death of an aurasa son after a year, bevo to observa aśauca for three days. On the news of the death of a sapinda living in the same country coming to a sapinda's ears after ten days but up to three months, the period of āśauos is three days, paksins up to 6 months, up to nino months one day and up to one year a bath. Rere also there are various views such as those of Madhava and others. Vide Suddhiprakasa pp. 49-51 for various views.

Asauca if death in another country

It quotes 637 a sharti verse 'on hearing that a person (sapipda) died in another country and in the case of the death of an impotent person or a forest hermit or an ascetic purification follows after a bath and the same applies to sagotra sapindas in the case of abortion, The Sadasiti (35) has a similar yerse 638 The Mit. quotes two verses of Brhaspati which define what deśāntara ( a different country ) means 639 'Where there is a large river or there is a mountain which separatas (one territory from another ) or where the languages differ then there is deśāntara. Some say that a different country means the distance of sixty yoganas, while others put it down at forty yojanas and still others at thirty Yojanas. There is a difference of opinion as to whether in order to constitute a different country all three must co-exist (viz. a large river, a mountain and difference of speech) or any one of the three will suffice or whether 60, 40 or 30 yojanas yould constitute a different country or whether the require ment of ten days for news to be carried to a place would constitute deśāntara The Sm.O and Şadaśīti 37 hold the view that any one of the above three is suficient while others hold other views. The Suddhiviveka 640 holds that a distance of 60 yojanas constituted deśāntara by itself, but even within sixty

yojanas if a large river, a mountain and difference of speech occurred together, that could give rise to deśāptara. The Smartyarthasāra 617 avers that deśāntara is differently described in the Smrtis, Purāṇas and the works on tirthas For yojana, vide H of Dh, vol. III n 185 pp. 145-146 

The Dharmasindhu (p. 435) provides that if the bones of an āhitāgne were not found and only an effigy of palāśa Jeaves were burnt, still the āśauca is for ten days even if he died in a different country and a long time had elapsed. Similarly, in the case of the effigy of one who is not an abitāgni, the aśauca is for ten days for his son and wife if they have not already obsorted any aśauca for him but if they had observed it (on hearing of his death ) then for three days (on the burning of the effigy ). For other sapindas ( than the son and wife) in the same circumstances three days and bath are respectively prescribed. 

It is provided in the Grhya kārikas, the Smrtyarthasāra (p 94), Dharmasindhu (p. 435) and other works that if & man 612 went to a distant country and no news of his being alive was heard, then his son or other relative), after the lapse of 20 years from the time when no news was heard if the man went away when he was young or 15 years if he left when he was of middle age or 12 years if he left later in life, should perforni three cāndrāyanas or thirty krcchras, prepare an effigy of the inan with kuśas (or with palāsa leaves ), should burn it and then observe āśauca and perform śrāddhas &c. 

To summarize the above discussion it is clear that as indicated by Medhātithi on Manu V. 58 there is a distinction as regards the periods of āśauca and the persons affected by it in several ways (1) There is a distinction between āśauca on birth and āśauca on death; (2) As to aśauca on death numerous distinctions arise viz (a) when there is abortion (garbhasrāva or garbhapāta, as in Saṅkha 15 4, Brhat-Parāśara VI p 186); (b) when the foetus comes out from the 7th to the 9th month of

Summary of rules on āśauca 

pregnancy or the child is still-born or dies after being born but before the appearance of teeth (Yaj. II. 23, Atri 95); (c) after the appearance of teeth but before cūdā or three years (Visnu 22. 29, Yā. III, 23); (d) after cūdā or three years up to upanayana (Manu V. 67), (e) after upanayana (Yaj. III, 23, Manu V, 59, Gaut. 14, 1); (f) as to āśauca on death after upadayana the duration at one time depended in the case of brahmanas on Vedic study, the perforaiance of srauta rites and whether the brahmana subsisted on ears of corn left in the field after the crops were harvested 643 (Parāśara III 5, Saṅkha 15 1, Atri 83, Agnipurāna 158. 10-11), (g) the duration of aśauca depended on caste (Gaut, 14. 1-4, Yāj III 22 &c ); (h) the duration of asauca depended on nearness of blood i, e. whether the person affected was a sapinda or a samānodaka (Gaut 14 1 and 18, Manu V, 59, 64); (i) the duration depended also on the nearness or distance from the place of death (Laghu-Aśvalāyana 20. 85, 89), (i) it also depended on whether the deceased died in a different country separated by a large river, a mountain or thirty yojanas (Laghu-Āśvalāyana 20.87); (k) duration depended on the time that elapsed before it came to the knowledge of the relative; (1) the duration depended upon whether another āśauca supervened when the period of the first was not over, 

If a person is born or died at night or news thereof is received at night, a question arises as to from what day the periods of āśauca are to be calculated For example, if a man died at 1 A M. on Monday, was Monday to be included in counting ton days of āśauca or was it to be excluded? There are two views on this point. 643« One view is that any time before midnight is to be counted as belonging to the previous day, while any time after midnight is to be taken as belonging to the next day. On this view in the above illustration Monday Tould be oncluded in the calculation of ten days, The other view is that the night is to be divided into three

parts and if death occurs in the first two of the three parts then the day is to be included in the calculation; if the time of death falls in the 3rd part, the ten days are to be calculated from the next day. On this view Monday would be included in the ton days. The Dharmasindhu (p. 435 ) remarks that in this matter the usage of the country is to be followed. Vide Madanapārijāta pp. 394-395 also. 

Several rules are mentioned in the smrtis about the periods of aśauca for the relatives of higher castes when they marry women of lower varnas (ie when there are anuloma marri ages). For example, Daks& VI. 12 says that if a brahmana has married wives of the four varnas, then the impurity on the delivery or death of these women respectively lasts for 10, 6, 3 or 1 day Vispu Dh. S (22, 22-24) provides that when a ksatriya has sapindas of the vaisya or śūdra varna the asauca on the birth and death of these lasts for six or three days, if a Taisya has a sūdra as sapinda then impurity is removed after six days, But when people of lover varnas have sapindas of higher varnas then jinpurity on birth and death ceases when the impurity of the higher varpa sapindas ceases, Laghu-Hārsta 84 (= Āpastambasmanti LX verse 13) bas similar provisions, Other smrtis and purānas like the Karna (Uttar ārdha 23. 30-36) mention differing views quoted in Hāralata pp 54-60, Smc M. pp. 495-496 The Madanapārijāta remarks (PP 425-426) that some say that these varging provisions may ba discarded or that they may be assigned their proper place according to the usages of the several countries or they should somehow be explained as based upon the parson affected being possessed of virtues or not or they may be held to be appli oable to seasons of distress or otherwise, 

According to the Mit on Yāj, 644 III, 22 persons belonging to the pratiloma castes have no periods of aśauca, but they have to observe rules of purification similar to those relating' to answering the call of nature Others like the Smrti-mukla phala 645 P. 495 aver, relying on Manu (X 41), that the pratiloma castas are like sūdras and have to observe the asauca prescribed for sūdras The Hāralatā ( 12 ) quotos Adipurāna to the effect that varnasankaras (i.e pratilomas)

Aśauca and pratiloma unions should follow the sūdras in the matter of aśauca and puri fication. The Smrtyartha-sāra (p. 92) states that those born of pratiloma upions should obserye aśauca if they perform prāyaścıtta, but if they do not perform prāyascitta then there is no āśauca for them. 

It has already been stated (P 215) how it was the duty of sapindas to take out the corpse and to cremate it and how carry ing the dead body of a poor brāhmada was highly eulogised (Parāśara III, 39-40). But, as Manu V 101–102 provide, if a brahmana carried through affection the dead body of one 646 who was not his sapinda, as if he were a bandhu or carried (the dead body) of his mother's bandhus (such as mother's brother or sister) he became pure after three days; but if he partook of the food of those who were bereaved by death he became pure after ten days and if he does not stay in the house of those bereaved zor partakes of their food he becomes pure in a day (but if he stays in their house though not partaking of their food he has to observe asauca for three days). Vide Kūrmapurāba (Uttarārdha 23. 37) and Visdu 22, 7-9 also. Gautama (14. 21-25) has rules on the same subject but they somewhat differ and Haradatta remarks that this āśauca is somewhat different from the aśauca observed by sapindas, viz, he becomes untouchable but he need not follow the other rules such as sleeping on the ground &c. If a person carried a dead body through greed (for money ), a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra bad to observe āśauca respectively for 10, 12, or 15 days or a month. This was called pirhārāśeuca, the word 'nirhāra 647 including the covering of the dead body with a garment, decking it with garlands, perfumes and ornaments, carrying it and cremating it. Sapindas who are observiog āśauca for the death of the same person may dine in the same house and partake of the food cooked, but not others who are not undergoing the same asauca.648

I VOL 

Gaut 14. 29, Mapu V. 103, Yāj. 11. 26, Parāśara III. 47 prescribe that a brāhmada should not follow the funeral pro cession of a deceased brahmana, but if he does so, he has to bathe, touch fire, take in ghee and then he becomes pure, Parāsara II 43-46 and Kūrmapurana (Uttarardha 23 45) proride a rising scale of the days of asauca if a brābmada follows the corpse of a ksatriya (aśauca for one day and pañcagarya), a raisya (asauca for two days and sir prādāpāmas), a sudra (aśauca for three days, bath in a rirer going to the sea, 100 prānāyāmas 649 and drinking of ghee) Vide Trimsac-cbloki Verse 13. 

If a brāhmana who is not a sapinda of the deceased trent to the bereaved family and wept along with the relatires before the collection of bones he had to obserre aśauca for a day and then a bath if the deceased was a ksatriya or Taisya, but āśauca for three days if the deceased vas a sūdra; but he had to undergo oply a bath if he went after the collection of the bones, then the deceased as a sūdra and the treering took place after the collection of bones he had to obserye āsauca for a rhole day and night. Vide Kūrmapurana (Uttarārdha 23 1627), Agnipurāpa 158 47-48, Par M 12 pp 283-285, Smr M (asauca) p. 543 and Āśbucadaśaka Terse 9 (for 70rhūra, following a funeral procession and Feeping) 

Persons 650 undergoing an aśauca on birth or death for one person were forbidden to touch other persons undergoing āsauc: for the birth or death of another person altogether. If they did so they had to perform prāyaścitta (Prājāpatya or Sāntapad3 ) 

Even if a person's wife left him and lived in illicit relation ship with a person of the same or higher caste ho bad to observa on her death āśauca for one day But if slie lived with one lower in varda than her husband, the latter had not, on her death, to observe any asauca at all (Y) DI 6) Similarly, one had to observe one day's āsauca on the death of sons that were not aurasa ( such as ksetraja) Vide Yāj III.25 and Visnu 22 42-43

Exceptions to Aśauca 

291 IY) asauca. While a marriage 6si rite (as also caula and upa nayana), festival in honour of a deity and a sacrifice (like Jyotistoma ) are in progress, if impurity due to birth or death overtakes the performer, the materials (money and other things ) already set apart for them may be dedicated or donated to the deity or brāhmadas and no fault is incurred. Ag regards food, a smrti text 65. quoted by the Mit, says 'if in marriage, in a festival in honour of a deity or in a sacrifice āśauca on birth or death intervenes, the cooked food should be served through others (not affected by the āśauca) and the donor and the partaker of the food inour no blame Acc. to Angiras, 653 Paithinasi (q by Sm, C.) and Visnu Dh. S., when once a sacrifice (like a Somayaga), a marriage, a sacrifice or festival in honour of the mother Goddesses or a deity or the dedication or foundation of an idol or temple has been begun a supervening aśauca does not matter, Even in modern times this is followed as regards upanayana and marriage. When exactly a sacrifice or marriage ceremony may be said to bave begun is laid down by Laghu-Visnu as follows 654 in the case of a sacrifice it may be said to begin when the priests are chosen, in the case of vratas and japa when the sankalpa (declaration) is made, in the case of marriage when the Nāndiśrāddha is performed, and in the case of a śrāddha when the food meant for the brāhmanas has been cooked completely. Certain things could be taken from the house of one who was undergoing āśauca 655 on birth or death and who was the owner thereof ( though not actually

(yol, from his hand, but with his permission). The Kūrmapurīda enumerates such articles They are 'fruits, flowers, raw vegetables, salt, firewood, butter-milk, curds, ghee, oil, drugs, milk and dry food' (like laddus, lājas ). Merici (q. by Mit on Yāj IIL. 17 ) and Trimsac-chloki verse 20 prosent even longer Lists of such things. 

Some smrtis and commentators lay down rules about the asauca to be observed by slaves when their masters are in āśauca. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 22.19, Devalasqırtı verse 6, Brhaspati quoted by Haradatta on Gaut, 14,4. But ag slavery has long been abolished this topic is passed over here, 

Aśaucasannipāta or āśaucasampāta (the knowledge of another aśauca coming to a person already observing one āśauca) 656 The rules about this matter were promulgated early enough and they are based on convenience and common sense. The rules try to give relief to persons who may be sorely tried if it were held that, when another āśauca superyenes while a person is already in the midst of one, he has to finish all the days of the first āśauca and then begin the period of the second āśauca. The Gaut. Dh. S. 14,5 starts by saying that if another āśauca superyenes on one already being undergone, purification results after the remaining days of the first āśauca are over. Then sūtras 6 and 7 provide that if the second āśauca supervenes in the last night of the first āśauca then purification results in two days after the first āśauca ends and if the second aśauca comes to be known in the last watch of the night of the last day of the first asauca, the second ends in three days after the first onds. Baud Dh. S. I, 5, 123 appears to be similar to Gout, 14 5-6 Manu V. 79, Yaj. III. 20, Visdu Dh, S. 22. 35-38, Saṅkha 15. 10, Parāśara III, 28 lay down the general rule promulgated by Gautama 14.5. 

Some general rules concerning this topic may first be stated The first rule is that in a conflict between aśauca on death and āśauca on birth, that on death is stronger 67 The

Rules on āśaucasannipāta 

293 

2nd rule is that if both asaucas are of the same kind and the second is of the same duration or of lesser duration than the first then a man gets rid of both at the end of the first, but if the second, though of the same kind, has a longer duration than the first, then purification follows at the end of the one that is of longer duration. It has to be remembered that birth and death give rise to asauca658 only when they are known by a person. 

On this topic there is a good deal of divergence between the views of the followers of the Mitaksarā, of the Gaudas and Maithilas (vide Suddhiprakasa pp 74-82, Nirpayasindhu 536–540). Following the Nirpayasindhu it may be said that twelve alternatives are possible, when another aśauca superyenes on an already existing one. They are set out here. (1 & 2) If both aśaucas are due to birth and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the first āśauca there is purification from both (Visou 22,35, Saṅkha 15 70); (3) If both āśaucas are due to birth and the second one is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Saṅkha 15.10, Sadasīti 19 ); (4 and 5) If both asaucas arise on death and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the period of the first asauoa there is purification from both; (6) If both āśaucas arise on death and the second that intervenes is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Sadaśīti 21); (7, 8 and 9) When the firt āśauca is one arising from birth and an āśauca due to deaths intervenes, the asauca on death must run its full course (i. e. there is no purification by the lapse of the first āśauca due to birth), whether the aśauca for death is of lesser duration than the asauca on birth, or whether it is of the same or of longer

duration (Şadasīti 18); (10, 11) If the 659 first āsauca arises on death and the superrening one is due to birth and is of lesser duration than the one on death or of the same duration then both end at the expiration of the first āśauca on death (Saiasiti 21); (12) If the first āsauca arises on death and the super vening one arises on birth and is of longer duration, then both run their proper courses (Şadasiti 21 ) 

The Dharmasindhu (P 436 ) generally follows the Niraiya sindhu but remarks: 'Asauca on death cannot be done away with by āśauca on birth which is of the same or greater dura tion; āśauca on death of the extent of paksini cannot get rid of āśauca on birth which is three or ten days in duration and āśaucs on birth extending to ten days cannot be got rid of br āsauca on death which is of three days' duration' These are the views of many triters À certain yriter says that assuc3 on birth though longer in duration can be got rid of bs asauca on death which is of lesser extent 

The Mit on Yā). II, 20 (irst half) states an exception to the above rules about asalica-sannipata Then a person's mother dies and then, while the period of āśauca for the mother's death is not over, the father dies, it does not follow that the āsauca for the father comes to an end th the end of the asauca for the mother, but the son has to observe the full period of aso the asauca for father's death Similaris, if the father died first and then, while the period of asauca for the father Tas not urer, the mother died. it does not follow that the assuca for the mother's death comes to an end rith the end of the first perida of aśauca for the father, but the son after ohserting the period of the father's āśauca has to observe āsauca for the mother ICT one paksini in addition It may be remarked that Aparāts: construes this Ferse differently by stating that if the father DJES during the period of asauca for the death of the mother, FLOP the general rule applies, viz tbat pirrification folloits at the evil of the āśauca for the mother

If, while an āśauca on death is being undergone, an asauca on birth arises, the father of the child born is able to perform the rites of Jatakarma and the like, because he is to be deemed to be purified for the Donce, according to Prajāpati.661 

The Sadaśiti (verse 22) provides 662 that the rule about purification on the expiry of the first āśauca in the case of succeeding asaucas on birth or death has three exceptions, viz. a woman who is delivered of a child, the person who actually cremates the body (of the deceased) and the sons of the deceased; that is, a sūtika has to observe the proper period of untouch ability and one who cremates a dead body has to observe asauca. for ten days, though the delivery or cremation takes place in the midst of an āśauca on death. 

SADYAH-SAUCA (purification on the same day). It has already been seen (p 274) that Daksa (VI %) speaks of ten kinds of impurity on birth or death, the first two of which are sadyah śūuca and ekāha Ekaha means day and night togetber (vide note 622 above) The ordinary meaning of 'sadyah' is 'at once, immediately.' But when Yaj III. 29, Parāśara ITI 10, Atri 97 and other smrtis employ the word 'sadyak-śauca' what a is meant is that there is no āśauca for a whole day or three days or ten days, but only up to the taking of a bath or up to the end of the day or the end of the night on which the event occurs Panini 663 mentions'sadyah' and thirteen other words in one sūtra' as mpātas (irregularly formed). From Yāž. II. 23 (ādantajanmanah sadya acūdānnaisiki smrtā) it impliedly follows that sadyah has the meaning of '2 part of a day or a part of the night' (as the case may be) and 'naisiki' means & whole day and night (as note 622 shows).

(pp. 340-341 ) explains 654 sadyaḥ' as meaning "a portion of the day or of the night' and cites several authorities in support The Suddhiprakasa (p 92 ) esplains that sadyahśauca 'in some contexts means 'absence of āsauca,' while in others it means *bath' and with reference to those killed in battle and the like (to whom pindas have to be offered) it means 'a part of the day or of the night.' The Sartimuktāphala 665 (asaucalanda) p 481 says that 'sadyaḥsauca' means 'impurity that comes to an end by a bath' That pipdas have to be offered to those about whom there is 'sadyahśauca' is stated by the Adipurīna 665 According to the Suddhikaumudi (p 73) sadyahsauca' has to meanings, viz. (1) the entire absence of āśauca as in the cases of sacrificial priests &c (Yāj III, 28), (2) āśauca that is removed by a mere bath (as in Madu V. 76 ) 

The rules about āśauca for sereral days do not operate in fire classes of cases, riz certain persons are exempted altogether, certain activities of certain persons who would ordinarily be untouchable owing to aśauca are allowed without causing pollu tion, certain artıces can be taken by anybody without fear of pollution from those who are affected by aśauca, no assuca is to be observed for certain deceased persons owing to their faults, in the case of certain persons express terts say that no āsauca peed be observed for them These five classes will briefly be dealt with in order In the principal texts these five classes of cases are rather mixed up. In the Vjspupurāna II 137 it is provided that there is sadyaḥśauca on the death of a child, or of a person dying in another country, of a patita, or of aB ascetic or on the death of a person cominitting suicide by water, fire or hanging Vide also Gaut 14 11 and 42 and Vāmanapurada 1299.

Cases of sadyah-sauca 

297 

Yāj. (III. 28–29) prescribes that there is sadyaḥsauca (purification after a bath) in case of birth or death (of a sepinda) for priests chosen for a sacrifice (after they are offered Madhuparka ), for those who have undergone diksā for a vedio sacrifice (like Somayāga ) and those who are engaged in performing the constituent parts of a Vedic sacrifice, those who continuously distribute food at a charity house, those who are engaged in prāyaścittas like candrāyana or the vows of sālalas, for brahmacārins (when performing the duties of their ūśrona), for persons who everyday make gifts of a cow, gold etc (at the time of making the gift), for those who have realized Brahman (ascetios); there is sadyahśauca at gifts (when once begun), at marriage, in a Vedic sacrifice, in battle (for those who are about to be engaged in it), when there is commotion in a country (through invasion ), and in a severe calamity (like famine when one can accept food from any body). Gaut. (14. 43-44) says that there is sadyahśauca in the case of kings as otherwise there will be obstacles in their duties and also in the casa of brāhmadas in order to prevent the cassation of their duties of teaching. Saṅkhalikhita say the same 'Rija dharmāyatanam sarvesām tasmādaDayaruddhah pretaprasa radosaih' (Suddhikalpataru p. 62). It is stated in Manu V, 93 that kings, 657 those engaged in vratas and satiras (like Gavān.dyana) are not liable to undergo the blemish of aśauca, because they (kings ) occupy the position of Indra (ruler) and are like Brahma (which is free from all talnt) and Manu V, 94 clinches the matter further by observing * sadyahśauca is ordained for the position of a king which can be obtained only by great merit (in past lives ) for the sake of the protection of the subjects and the reason of this (rule) is the position that he occupies.' Similarly, Gobhilasmrti 668 

667. न राजामघदोपोस्ति वतिना न च सविणाम्। ऐन्द्रं स्थानमुपासीना अभूता हि ते सदा राक्षो माहात्मिके स्थाने सद्य शौचं विधीयते। प्रजानां परिरक्षार्थमासनं चात्र कारणम्॥ HY V, 93-94. The first verse is the same as Vasistha 19.48 (Furber's text is corrupt, which must be corrected into morirea) wbich cites it as Yama's. It is toe position that he holds that readers tbc king (whether a ksatriya, brālmana or sūdra) (ree from a sauca The Fouge (22, 47-52) restricts the absence of aśzuca by saying 'Llags are frec (rom Zéanca when they are per forming the dolies of a king (such as administration of justice)': TIET राजकमणि नवतिनांबते न सत्रिणांसन कारूणां स्वकर्माण न राजाज्ञाकारिणां तदिया।'

[Vol. (III, 64-65, often quoted as Chandogaparisista of Katyāyana ) states'in & gūtaka, a brahmacārin should not give up his peouliar duties (Veda study and vratas), a sacrificer his various actions (required) in a sacrifice after he has undergone diksa, one who is practising penance should not give up krcohra and the like; these do not incur impurity aven on the death of their father (or mother) The Kūrmapurāua 669 provides no impurity is declared on death in the case of perpetual or temporary brabmacārins, forest hermits or ascetics'. Similar rules are given by Atri 97-98, Lioga-purāna, pūryabhāga, chap. 89.77, The Mit. on Yāj IIL, 28 remarks that in the case of the three aśramas of brahmacārın, vānaprastha and yat, there is freedom from impurity in all cases and at all times; ascetics and brahmacārips have to undergo a bath with clothes on the death of their father or mother (Dharmasindhu p. 442 ); in the case of several others such as those who are continually making gifts or are observing vratas there is freedom from impurity only when they are engaged in those particular actions and not when they are engaged in any action whatever or when they mix up among others for everyday work, 670 Similar rules occur in Parāśara IL21-22. It has already been stated follow ing Manu V. 91 ( Visdu 22,86 ) thet a brahmacarin was not to perform the last rites (of carrying the corpse, crenation) for anybody except for five persons (viz. his parents, upadhyāya, ācārya and guru ) He did not incur āśauca by performing the funeral rites of his parents and offering water and pinda to them, But if he did so for any one other than the five mentioned by Manu he had to observe āśauca for ten days, and to undergo prāyasoitta and had his woanavanu performed again. A brahma Carin had to observe after samūrartana (returning from the Vedic teacher) asauca for three days for all relatives that died during the period of his studenthood ( Manu V. 88. Vispu Dh, S. 27,87). Gautama (14. 42-44) says generally671 that on the death of child

Enceptions to āśauca 

sho are sapindas, thou ea for kinetotecting the no 

ran (before the appearance of teeth or before Cūda), of those who are separated by a country, of ascetics and of those who are not sapindas, the relatives are purified by only a bath; so also there is sadyahśauca for kings, for otherwise there would be conflict with their duty (of protecting the subjeots) and for a brāhmana also in order that there may be no cessation of Vedic study.672 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 93) remarks that though there is no āśauca (as stated by Yāj III. 28 ) yet & sacrificia) priest and & diksita had to bathe on the death of a sapinda, a brahmacarin also would have to take a bath if he followed the funeral procession of his father of mother &c, but an ascetic would not have even to bathe and that usage was the same in its day. 

The second class of exceptions refers to cases where certain persons, though they have incurred āśauca, are allowed to do certain acts or carry on their activities without bringing pollu tion to those with whom they deal or come in contact. For example, Parāśara (III. 20-21) says; 'craftsman (such as those who drary pictures or washermen), workers (cooks and the like), physicians, male and female slaves, barbers, kings and śrotriyas are declared to be sadyahśauca, as also one observing & vrata (cāndrāyana &c.), one purified by baing engaged in a sattra (such as Gavām-ayana), a brāhmana who has established śrauta fires; the king has not to observe āśauca and also any one (such as his purohita) whom the king for his own purpose desires pot to observe it. The Adipurada673 gives the reason why craftsmen, physicians and others were allowed not to observe āśauca when engaged in their peculiar tasks, viz, what these people do cannot be done by any one else at all or at least so well or go easily.

(Vol. It has 674 to be noted that the absence of āśausa in the case of oraftsmen, physicians and the like has to be restricted to the peculiar activities of these and does not extend to all actions such as religious rites, érāddhas and gifts This is clear from the words of the Visoudharmasūtra 675 22. 48-52. The Trimsacchloki (verse 18 ) 676 gives a long list of such peculiar activities The Kūrmapurāpa (Uttarardha 23 57-64) has nine Verses on this topic which are quoted by the Hāralatā (p. 114), 

It has already been seen (pp 238–240) that Pār gr. II, 10 (nityāni vinivartante paitānavarjam), Manu V. 84, Yaj II 17 (latter half) provide that even those who have to undergo aśauca on death should not stop rites to be performed with srauta fires, but should perform then themselves or get them performed through others. Thus certain religious rites were allowed to be done øven by those who were aśaucın. 

The Dharmasindhu (p 552) emphasizes that this exception to āśauca should be availed of only when there is no other alternative or in a season of distress, 

It has already been stated hovy certain materials and things can be received without any pollution from thoge who are undergoing āśauca. That is the third class of cages which are exceptions to the rules of āśauca. 

The fourth class of cases where rules of aśauca do not apply relate to persons deceased to whom some fault or taint attaches. Gaut. (14. 11) 677 and Saṅkha-Likhita provide that there is sadyahsauca for those who kill themselves (1. e. commit suicide) by starting on the great journey (to the Himalaya), by fasting, by a weapon (like a dagger), by fire or poison or water or by hanging or by falling down from a precipice.

Cases of no āśauca

Yaj. III, 6 provides 678 that women that have gone over to heterodox viets and practices, that do not belong to any particular āśrama, that are thieves (of gold and the like), that (attempt to) kill their husbands, that are unchaste and the-like, that drink liquor and that attempt suicide, do not deserve to have water offered to them (on death) and no āśauca should be observed for them. This verse applies to men also as far as possible. Manu V. 89-90 are to the game effect, The Kūrmapurana alao prescribes 67) that for him who kills himself by means of fire, poison and the like, no āśauca, no cremation and no offering of water is prescribed, there is no cremation for patrias, nor antyesti nor collection of bones, no shedding of tears and no pinda and no sraddha should be per formed for them. It is provided by Angiras quoted by Mit. on Yāj III, 6 that death results to evil-minded men from capdalas (with whom a quarrel is purposely got up), from Tater, from a snake, from & brāhmana, from lightning and from animals that have sharp fangs (like tigers). If water and pinda are offered to such people (who die wilfully in these cases) they (water and pinda) do not reach them and perish in mid air.' These verses refer to death in a wrathful fight with tigers, snakes and the like or guicide in water through wrath or sorrow, But, if one died in vater or by fire through inadvertence or negligence, then Angiras 650 himself provides that water should be offered and aśauca should be observed. Long pagsages are quoted from the Brahmapurāna by Haradatta on Gaut. 14. 11, Suddhiprakāśa pp. 56-57, Nirnayasindhu p. 550, which elabo. rate the same ideas as those of Yaj. II. 6, Angiras and others and wind up by stating that if any one offers water or śrāddha to patzłas through affection or cremates then, he has to undergo prāyaścitta (viz. tyo Taptakrcobras).

Ten pindas 685 are to be offered on darbhas to the deceased after repeating his name and gotra (as stated in the note below). After the ton pindas are cast in a river, there is tai pana of the deceased sisteon times with the sixtaon stanzas of the Purusa sūkta. Then bali is offered separately to Visnu, Brahmā, Siva and Yama with his servants. 

In the Mitālsarā, there is no homa nor bali, both of which are described in the Antyestzpaddhati and the Smrtyartbasāra (pp. 85-86) copies verbatim the procedure given in the Mit, Brhatparākara (V. pp. 175-176) contains the same procedure that is set out by the Mit. from the Vispupurāna. The Nirnaya sindhu first describes Nārāyapabali as gathered from Hemadri and the Garudapurada (III, 4. 113-119) It then describes Nārāyanabali to be performed for a deceased ascetic on the 18th day (along with Pārvanaśrāddha), following the procedure lajd down by Baudhāyana. It then describas another form of Nārāyanabali based on Saunaka which is meant for all those who commit suicide or who are killed by oāndālas, 6% snakes, lightning, animals with fangs or who die in a distant land of for ascetios and yogins. The Vrddha-Haritasmrti (IX. 123–145) describes another method of Nārāyapabalı for devotees of Vispu. 

The Vaikhānasa-smartasūtra (X. 9) sets out a rather brief procedure of Nārāyanabali which was intended for the boven of men who committed suicide or were slain and for ascetius and provides that the same may be performed for those guilty 

their death. The of mahāpātakas after twelve years from

Baudhāyana-grhya-segasūtra II. 20 and 21 contain two different sets of the procedure of Nārāyaṇabali, the latter of which appears to be the later one. The latter contains the well-known Verse about death at the hands of candālas, from a snake &c. 

The 5th class of exceptions to aśauca rules comprises those that are declared by express texts as not liable to observe an asauca, Gautama (14. 8–10) provides 687 that (the sapindas) of those that met death for the sake of cows and brābmanas, of those that met death through the wrath of the king and those that were killed in battle bave to observe no āśauca but only 'sadyahśauca'. Manu T. 95 and 98 state 688 that(the sapindas) of those that are killed in a sudden affray or by lightning or by the king (for an offonce ) or of those that not death in protectia ing cows and brābmanas and of one who was killed in the fashion of ksatriyas in a battle by the sword have to observe no aśauca, as also he whom the king deaires (for his purpose) to observe no āśauos. It is provided by Sātātapa 689 that as regards a yatı dying, bis sons and other sapindas are not to offer vater or pinda to him or to observe aśauca for him. The Dharmasindhu (p. 449) says that this applies to all ascetics, whether they be tridandın or ekadandın, hamsas or parama hanisas. So also on the death of a vānaprastha there is no āśauca. In the case of one who has performed his own sraddha while alive his sapindas have an option either to observe asanca or not. On the death of a brahmacārin āśauca is to be observed, The Dharmasindhu further notes that in all yorks it is stated that there is no āśauca 690 for one killed in battle, but at least

among brahmanas (i. e. as to brāhmanas killed in battle) th usage of the sustas is different (i. 0. Agauca is observed). 

Parāsara (II. 12-13) provides that, if a man has gone for many years to a distant land and it is ascertained that he died there but the exact date of his death is not known, then either of three tethis viz, the 8th or 11th day of the dark half or the amāvāsya should be accepted as the day of his death and water, pinda and śrāddha should be offered on that date and the Par. M. I. 2 p. 237 adds that āśauca also inust be calculated from that date. On the other hand Laghu-Harita says that if there Is some obstacle at the time of a grāddha or when the date of death is not known, then the funera) rites should be performed on the 11th tithi of the following dark half (Suddhikaumudi p. 17) 

The digests lay particular emphasis on the fact that in matters of aśauca the usages of a country must be observed. The Hāralatā (pp. 55, 205 ) quotes passages from the Adipurada where special reference is made to the authority of the usages of & country (desa-dharmapramāpatvāt). The Suddhitattva p. 276 quotes692 & verse of Marici 'one should not disregard the manner of observing sauca and religious usages that are current in particular localities; the dharma is of that sort slone in those localities'. On p. 276 it quotes & passage of the Vāmanapurana to the same effect. 

It deserves to be noted that Daksa 692 (VI 15) states that all rules about asauca apply when the times are easy and peacefu) but when a man is overwhelmed by distress there is no (enforcement or application) of the (rules of) āśauod 

Visnu (19. 18-19) provides 693 that at the end of the period of āśauca one should go out of the village, get himself shaved and take & bath after applying a thick paste of sesamo or white mustard to the body, change garments and then re-enter the house. Then he should perform & tāntı (propitiatory rite!

and honour brahmanas. Many medieval digests provide for & more elaborate procedure. For example, the Suddhikaumudi (pp. 155-164) sets out the procedure of the 11th day separately for the followers of the three Vedas. A few salient points may be mentioned. After & bath for the whole body, the sapindas should touch a cow, gold, fire, dūrvā, clarified butter and repeat the name of Gorinda, then engage brāhmavas to sprinkle śānti water over them and say 'spasti'. If a brāb mana cannot be had one should himself perform śānti. The Hāralatā and others say that without sānti wator āśauca is not completely removed. The followers of Sāmaveda should sing the Vāmadevagāna for sānti or should repeat the four Vāmadevya versos viz. 'kaya naścitra,' 'kastvā satyo,' abhi sū nab' (No. 682-684 of the Sāmayeda) together with the last Verse of the Sāmaveda 'syasti na Indro') preceded and followed by the sacred Gayatrt; these form the śānti mantras for Sāpiaredins. For followers of Yajurveda seventeen mantras beginning with 'rcam Tācan prapadye' and ending with 'dyauh śāntih', preceded and followed by the Gayatri form the santi mantras; the ægvedins should employ for śānti Rg. X. 9, 4, VII, 35.1, V. 47, 7 &c. preceded and followed by the Gayatri. Then some gold with silver as daksidā should be donated to a brāhmana, then the Vaitaradi cow should be donated, if one was not given at the approach of death, then a gift of the bedstead &c. should be made. 

We have seen (p, 270) that originally the sūtras (like San Sr.) and smrtis (like Manu) emphasized that one should not inorease the number of the days of asauca and that men learned in the Veda and consecrating srauta fires bad to undergo only one day's asauca (Parāśara IIL 5, Daksa VI. 6). But ultimately a flat period of ten days of asauca (Manu V, 59) for all sapindas oame to be prescribed. In the old days the means of communi cation were very limited, and hence the news of a birth or death must have taken considerable time to reach relatives staying eron at a short distance and hence the restrictions imposed by the rules of ābauoa were not felt to be very irksome It is on account of this reason and also the great penchant of dharma Śāstra writers for all sorts of divisions, sub-divisions and classifications that we find medieval writers bestowing an enor mously exaggerated attention in very exuberant and enthusias.. tic style on such a subject as aśauca Most nations have their OF_usages to ipdicate that a person (male or female) oz. family is jn mourning.

can equal (much less surpass) the Dharmaśāatra writers in the elaborate rules evolved in books about aśauca on birth and death. In these days when there is a State postal system and the njeans of communication abound owing to railways, air. mail, telegraph and wireless, the ancient and medieval rules of āśauca are felt by all people to be most galling and tronblo some Mischievous people sometimes create trouble ju the cele bration of marriages by sending information about a death or a birth to persons against whom they have a grudge, Devices have to be employed for dodging the inconvenience due to rules of āśauca. It is therefore necessary to introduce substantial changes in the rules about āśauca that will prevent trouble, Joss of time and work and would at the same time be mord or less in agreement with the spirit of the dicta of the smrtig and the gentiments of most common people. At the end in the appendix note 693a is added which gives the text of the Āśauca-daśaka with Sanskrit explanation. 

As regards āśauca on birth I would recommend that here after in the changed set-up of society in these days one simple rule should bo observed, viz. it is only the mother that has to observe impurity for ten days and no one else has to observe impurity on birth. This is in general accordance with the ancient smrtis set out above, 

As regards impurity on death four rules should ordinarily suffice.6920 

(1) Asauca for ten days on death should be observed by the father and the mother for the son and by the son for the parents, by the wife for the husband and vice versa and by oile who performs the rites of cremation and the rites after death. 

(2) For others (than the above) staying near the deceased as members of a joint family āśauoa for only threo days should suffice, 

(3) For all other relatives of the deceased whenever the nows of death may reach them within a year after death, only a bath should be enough. 

(4) When the death Jocurred more than a year bofors the news reached the relatives not even a bath should be required in the case of any relative except those mentioned in the first rule, who should be held olean after a bath.

Most important tabus Practices observed among ancient and modern primitive tribes show that the most important fabus were those on the dead, on women in child-birth and women in their monthly illness Among the ancient Israelites all that were unclean through the dead were put outside the cainp and they were not allowed to offer an offering at the Passover (Numbers V.1-4 and IX 6). Among the Syrians those who belonged to the family of the dead man vere tabu for 30 days and could then enter only with shaven heads Child-birth made a woman unclean and the number of days that she vas to be unclean depended on whether the child was a male or a female (Leritious '1% 2-5). In India also the ancient Aryans probably inherited their ideas about unoleanness on death and child-birth from their remote ancestors If one may surmise one can say this it must have been found out by the remote ancestors of the Vedic Aryans that if a person touched a dead body or used the clothes worn by the dead man when living, he also suffered from the same disease (particularly in the case of contagious diseases like plague, cholera, typhoid &c.) and that segregating such a person for ten days from other members of the tribe' or community made the latter immune from the attack of such diseases. Therefore, those who touched the dead or carried the corpse for cremation or burial abd the members of the family were thought to be unclean and were segregated for ten days. Gradually the ideas about the uncleanness on death and the necessity of segregation were made applicable to death due to all diseases or causes whatever. The uncleapness on child birth might have been a case of extension by analogy derived from the tabi on death At all events smrti writers put botlı on the same level (a, g, Manu V 61 "Just as impurity on death is ordained for ten days in the case of sapindas the same holds good in the case of birth"). Rules about women in their monthly illness were prescribed as early as the Tai. S. and have been already dealt with in of Dh, vol. IL pp. 80%-805, 

We have now to turn to the subject of suddhi apart from ūśauca. Suddhi of a diavya means the 694 removal of a taiat attaching to a thing and it is of two kinds, purification of the body and the purification of an external Object (Manu V. 110 and Aparārka 253). It has already been seen (zote 555

History of Dharmalāstra above) how even thc Rg. Jays great emphasis on śuddhi and being pure (suci). There are Vedic 695 passages laying down that the cups (grahas) used in Jyotistoma and other sacrifices were to be cleansed with a strainer of wool, but not the camasas. In the Ait. Br. 32.4 it is provided that if the milk of an agnihotrını that was heated by him for the homa became impurs (amedhya, by an ant or vorm falling therein ), the milk is to be taken up in an agnihotrabavads and was to be poured upon the ashes near the Ahavaniya fire. This shows that great care was taken about the purity of vessels to be used in sacrifices and about the offerings to be made Śauca is one of the eight qualities of the soul (almagungs) mentioned by Gaut 824, Atri (verses 33, 35), Matsyapurāna 52. 8-10, Brhaspati (q. by Aparārka p 164 ). Haradatta on Gautama quotes a verse that sauca is of four kinds viz. monetary purity, mental purity, bodily purity and purity in speech ; while Atri and Brhaspat75% (q. by Aparūrka p. 164), aver that sauca is constituted log avoiding what ought not to be eaten, by associating (on)) with those who 3re not censured (i. 8. are not reprehensible) and by firmly abiding by one's own prescribed duties. Many works divide squca into two varieties viz bahya (external) and antara or ābhyantara (internal). Vide H, of Dh vol. I. pp 651-5% for passages from Baudhāyana Dh, S. (I 5, 3-4), Harita, Daksa and others defining and subdividing these. Agni 37%. (17-18) is the same as Daksa V.3. The Vanaparva 200,52 speaks of purity in speech, in actions and that brought about by water The Padma (II, 66, 86-87) emphasizes that it is the mental attitude that is the highest thing and illustrates it by saying that a woman embraces her son and her busband with different mental states. There is an interesting passage in the Lingapurāna 8. 34-36 (not quoted there) which after stating that ābhyantara sauca is superior to bāhya sauca (verse 31) reniarks 69 that one void of inper purity is dirty even after a

Importance of mental purity

bath, that gloss, fish and animals subsisting on fish are always immersed in water, that in spite of that no one would call them pure, that therefore one must always endeavour to secure inner purity and that one should bathe in the water of correct know ledge of the Self, apply Once the sandal paste of faith and purify oneself by the clay in the form of desirelessness and that this is declared to be the real) sauca. Manu V. 106 provides that of all kinds of purity mental purity is the highest. He who is pure as to wealth (i. e. who does not deprive another of wealth by unjust means) is the (only) pure man and not he who is purified by water and earth. Vispu 22. 89 is the same except that for wealth (artha) it substitutes food (anna ). The Trikāndamandana (prakirpaka 21) has the same verse as Madu V. 106. Vide also Anusagana 108. 12 (for purity of conduct, of mind, of a holy place, purity due to correct philosophical knowledge); Brahmānda II, 14, 60 (sucikāmā bi devā vai), and Yogasutra II. 32 (for sauca as one of the five niyawas). 

External purity of the body by various means (ringing the mouth, bath & c.) has already been described in detail in . of Dh. vol. II pp. 648-668. The ancient and medieval Indians insisted on a daily bath for all, recommended two baths w day in certain cases and three baths to a hermit and did not subs cribe to the view of some of the early Christians, St. Agnes was canonized primarily for her refusal to bathe and St. Francis of Assisi considered dirt as one of the proper insignia of holy poverty. 698 

In śrauta rites (such as Agnistoma) the sacrificer had to undergo & sovere discipline of consecration (or dikgā ), one item of which was the purification of the intending sacrificer's body by the adhvaryu priest by rubbing the former's body twice with three bunches of seven darbhas each (vide E, of Dh. vol. II, p. 1136) Śātātapa q by Sm, O. I p. 120, Suddhiprakaśa p. 147 provide bath for one who has sexual intercourse with his wife during the period from the 5th to the 16th day after monthly illness begins, but for intercourse after these days the purifica tion is the same as for urination and voiding ordure ; bath is also prescribed for vomiting after sunrise, after shaving, after a bad dream, on the touch of foul men (such as candālas ).

I Vol. The Ap śr. II. 12 provideg 699 that Pavitresti should be performed by him who is desirous of suddha and that if one performs in each season the three stis, viz Vaiśvānart (to Agni Yaiśyādara), Vrātapati (to Agni Vratapati) and the Pavitresti one purifies ten generations (of his family ). 

The following pages will deal with the purification of things (dravyasuddhı ). But & few general observations must first be made. The Ap Dh, S (II 6.15 17-20) states that infants do not become polluted or impure (by the touch of a woman in ber monthly course) up to the time the samskūra of annaprū sana (taking cooked food for the first time), that, according to some, up to one year or as long as they cannot distinguish betspeen the different directions or up to the time of Upanayana according to others. Manu V. 127-133, Yā, I, 186, 191-193, Vispu Dh. S 23. 47-52, Baud, Dh I 5 56-57, 64, 65, Saṅkha 16 12-16, Mārkandeya-purāna 35 19-21 state that the following are always pure.what is not seen to be polluted; what is cleansed with water; what is commended expressly (by a brahmana as pure, when there is a doubt), water collected on (pure) ground that is not visibly polluted by an impure thing and that in quantity is so much that a cot can slake its thirst therein and that bas the smeli, colour and taste of pura water ); the hand of a craftsman ( such as a washerman or a cook while engaged in his peculiar work); articles exposed for sale in a market such as rice and barley (though touched by many intending buyers); alms (collected by a brahmicūrini though walking from house to house on the road), the mouth of a woman (at the time of dalliance), meat of animals soizod or killed even by dogs, cāndālas, and carnivorous birds, rays (of the sur), fre, dust, the shadow of a tree or tho like), a cow, a horse, land, vind, der drops, flies, a calf at the time of making the cow flow with milk from the udder-these lattor

Atri (240, 241) contains several verses 702 on this point, 'Things taken out from a ming or from kit chens (or places where grain is pounded &c.) are never impure, singe all such places (where anything is prepared in the mass) except a place for the manufacture of liquor are pure. All fried (or roasted) things, fried barley and grain, dates, camphor, whaterer else is well fried is pure'. In Atri V. 13 we read 703 'flies, a continuous stream (of any liquid), the earth, water, fire, a cat, & vooded ladle and a mongoose are always pure, Parāśara (X. 41) states:774 'spacs (ākāśaḥ, vind, fire, water fallen on the earth, darbhas are not to be deemad polluted just 3s camasas in sacrifices are held to be not polluted.'

Saṅkha 708 states that whatever removes the dirt (or polla tion) that is natural to a substance or arises from contact with another polluting substance must be declared to be its purifier. Saṅkha-Likhita 709 declare that the substances that bring about purification of all (polluted things) are trater, clay, the powder (or paste) of soap berries, bilya fruit, rica and mustard cake, salts (ashes), cow's urins and dung and that according to some when a substance is heaped up in a big mass, sprinkling with water, Manu V. 118, Yaj. I 184, Visou Dh. S 23.13 also provide that sprinkling with water is the mode of purification when large quantities of corn or clothes are pollu ted, but when the quantity is small they must be washed with water. The quantity is said to be large when it is more than what one man can carry as a load (according to Kullūka on Manu V. 118). 

The general rule laid down by Gaut. I. 45–46, Manu V 126 ( Vispu 23. 39), Yaj. I 191 about the purification of things or bodies that are smeared with foul matter is that water and earth are to be employed for purification till the foul odour and the contact of the foul thing is entirely removed 719 Dorala (q. by Aparārka p. 270) defines sauca as the removal by means of clay, water, cowdung and the like of the besmearing, the oiliness and odour of a thing that cause impurity.

316 Purification of things 

Gaut. Dh. S. (I. 28-33 ) briefly deals 710a with the purification of things as follows: Purification of metallic substances (like bell-metal), earthenware, substances manufactured from wood, cloth made of threads or yarn is brought about respectively by rubbing (or scouring) them, by baking in fire, by chiselling or planing, by washing in water; objects made of stones, jewels, shells and pearls are purified by the sama means as metallio substances; bones (ivory and the like) and mud ( floor of houses) are purified in the same way as wooden substances; and earth (when polluted) is also purified by adding to it earth (brought from another pure spot); ropes, chips of bamboos and reeds, leather are purified by the same means as cloth or they may be abandoned when they are extremely polluted (as by the spilling of wine or urine or ordure). Vas (II. 49–53) has almost the game words, employing the word 'bhasmaparimārjana' (scour ing with ashes and washing) for 'parimārjana'. The Āp. Dh. S, (I. 5, 17. 10–13) 711 provides: 'If one gets a used vesse) only, he shall eat from it after having heated it thoroughly; a vessel made of metal is purified by being scoured with ashes and the like; & wooden passel becomes pure by being scraped; at a sacrifice, Vessels must be cleaned according to the precepts of the Veda.' Yaj. (IIT, 31-34) states; time (lapse of ten days of a year as to aśausa), fire, religious rites (like Aśramedha or performing of sandhyā), clay, wind, mind, spiritual knowledge, austerities (such as krochra), water, repentance (in the case of sins), fastingmall these are the causes of purification. Gifts are the (main) cause of purification for those who do what is forbidden, flow of water in the case of a river, clay and water are means of suddl in the case of substances that are not clean, sannyāsa (order of asceticism) in the case of the twice-born, austerities in the case of those that bave studied the Veda when they commit a sin (through ignorance), forbearance in the case of those who know the Self, water in the case of dirty limbs, silent recital of Vedic mantras ( Japa) is the means of purifica

Mama V. 107-109 (= Vispo 22,90_92) contain almost the ssme idea ia almost the same vords. 

la prescribing the methods of cleaning polluted objects certain matters have to be considered according to a rerse ascribed to Baudhāyana 112 by the Afit, (on Yāj I 190) Thich states: 'One should prescribe means of purification after con sidering the time, the place, the body (or himself), the thing (to be purified), the purpose for which the thing is to be used, origin (of defilement), the condition (of the thing or person defiled). 

There is some divergence of riers about the means of puri fying or cleansing certain objects. Tt is unnecessary to get ont in detail these differences. It is proposed to take certain objects one after another and to specify how they rere rendered purs according to several of the smrtis and digests, 

Certain foul things Trere said by the Surtyarthasars p 70 to be the causes of extreme pollution and certain others as causes of lesser or insignificant pollution. For example, escreti, ujno, semen, blood, fat, marron, liquor and intoxicants Tere the causes of great pollution; Thile dogs, village sine, cats, their urine, the tas from the ear, nails, phlegm, discharge froʻzz the eyes, perspiration are the causes of insignificant pollution. 

Baud DI. S. I. 5 66 provides 713 that the purification of the ground is brought about by means of sweeping with a (fault less) broom, by sprinkling (cos's milk, urine or water), bs smearing with coxdung, bg scattering (pure clay on it) and by Bcrubbing away (or scraping) some of the soil, when these ara employed according to the situation of the ground and the particular impurity (of which it is to be purified) Baud Di.

Vasistha III 57 quotes a verse which mentions five means of purification almost in the same words as those of Baudhayana (except the sixth viz time) Manu V, 124 mentions five means of purification, yiz, sweeping with a broom, smoaring with cor dung, sprinkling, digging (and removing), the stay 'of covs thereon (for one day and night). Vispu Dh S. 23 57 adds daha (burning) to the five of Manu Yāj. I. 188 mentions seven means of the purification of the ground by adding dūha (burn ing) and kala (lapse of time) to the fire mentioned by Manu, According to 715 the Vāmanapurāpa the ground is purified by diggiog, burning, sweeping, treading by cows, smearing of cowdung, scrubbing and by sprinkling water, Davala quoted by the Mit and Aparārka on Yaj. I 188 gives a more elaborate treatment According to him polluted ground (bhiimi) is of three kinds, viz amedhyā (impure), dustā (soiled), and malınā (dirty). Where a woman is delivered of a child or dies or is cremated or where a spot has been inhabited by cāndālas or where there are beaps of ordure and the like, ground that is full of foul things in this way is declared to ba amedhijā, 716 That ground which is polluted by the contact of dogs, pigs, asses, camels and the like becomes dustā (soiled) and it becomes malınā (dirty) by charcoal, husk, hair, bones or ashes.

[Vol. Davāla 717 prescribes the purification of the three kinds of ground: 'Purity is of five kinds, viz. digging up, burning (with wood or grass), smearing (with cowdung), washing (with water) or the fall of rain Even amedhyā ground may be purified by these five means employed together (whero a corpse is creniated or candālas dwell) or by four (i . omitting rainfall or burning in other cases of amedhyā); ground that is dustā is purified by three (digging up, burning and smearing with cowdung) or two (viz digging up and burning) and malınā ground is purified by one (i. e. by digging up). 

The Smrtyarthasara (pp. 73-74) provides that if an idol made of iron or other metal is slightly polluted (as defined above) then it can be purified by means of pancagavya after rubbing it with ashes; similarly a stone idol, when slightly polluted, should be washed with water mixed with the clay from an ant-hill and becomes pure after being treated with pafcagavya. Any idol, if polluted with ordure, urine or village mud would become pure after first being flooded for five days with pancs gavya, after being well washed with cow's urine, cowdung and clay from an ant-hill and by being again installed (with all installation rites). Questions about the pollution of temples by the entry of the so-called untouchables or by the entrance of persons other than brāhmadas in the inmost shrine (garbhagrha) have come before the courts 8. g. in Gopala Muppanar v. Dharmakarta Subramania 27 Madras Law Journal p. 253 at p. 258, where reference is made to the ceremonies for the removal of pollution according to the Agamas and Tantras. In S. K. Wodeyar V. Ganapati (37 Bom, L R 584) the point arose whether, when a custom was alleged that in a temple at Badavasi in the Canara district none could enter the inner sanctum except persons belonging to the ten sub-divisions of brābmanas and a Lingayat entered it in spite of the protests of the worshippers in charge of the temple, his entry polluted the temple and whether he was liable to pay for the sum spent over the puri fication of the temple, the High Court of Bombay held that the custom alleged viz of excluding from the inner sanctum all that were not brābranas was proved and that the Lingayat gentle man who entered it in spite of protests was liable to pay dam ages for the wrongful entry.

Pollution of temples or idols

purrardha pp. 351-52), the Dharmasindhu (III p. 324) and other medieval digests provision is made for the re-consecration (purah-pratistha) of an idol in a temple when the idol is polluted by the touch of cāndālas or vine or is burnt by fire or is defiled by the touch of sinners or the blood of a brāhmada 718 If the idol be broken in two or more pieces or if it becomes broken (irregularly), if it be burnt or falls from its pedestal or be insulted, is without worship or is touched by an ass or the like animal, or falls on foul ground or is worshipped with the mantras of other gods,-in these ten circutostances Godhood ceases to indvell in the idol. If an idol be touched by robbers, capdālas, patita people, by a dog or a woman in her courses or if it be polluted by the touch of a corpse re-consecration is necessary. 

The Visnu dharmasutra (23.34) provides that idols when polluted should be purified in the same way in which the sub stanca of which they are made (such as stone or copper &c.) is purified and then they should be re-consecrated. If the worship of an idol already consecrated is stopped for a day, two days, a month, or two months or it is touched by sūdras or a woman in her monthly course, then at a proper time punyahavācana should be performed, an even number of brāhmapas should be fed, the idol should be submerged in water for a night and next day bathed with pañca-gavya from a jar full of it to the accompaniment of the respective mantras, then another jar should be filled with pure water and therein the nine kinds of precious stones should be cast, the jar should then have the

Recentis after the attainment of Independence some of the Provincial Legislatures in India have passed lars (eg Bomb35 Act 35 of 1947, C. P. and Berat Act 41 of 1927) throring open all Hinda poblictemples to peopie who Tere once called untouchable This is not the place to discuss in detail the arguments for and against these meastres. Many orthodox Hindus hold that their inmost feelings are hurt by this tyranny of the majority in ibe Legislatures. They feel that these meastes are contrary to the four freedoms that are promised in many constitutions Ti. freedom of speech, freedom of Torship, freedom fro'd want and freedom from fear. These measures are likely to be follored by serious consequences. It is felt that the younger generation LOS being educated has hardly any iaith in religion or in anythips being sacred, that the so-called untouchables themselves when once they have asserted their right of entering Hindu temples scarcels erer care to frequent them and the orthodox Hindus also oñen cease to worship therein. There is the further fe3r that, if majjgions feelings eren stei umasonable according to prozras sire Tiers could be tranpled upon by the Tiera oi the majority, there is no proving there the process rould stop.

of marion very ancient 47 and 49 ar geribed as them and 3 

From very ancient times water has been regarded as & great purifier. Rg. VII. 47 and 49 are hymns addressed to vaters as divinities and they are there described as themselves pure and as purifying others (as in Rg. VII. 49. % and 3 * śucayah pāyakah). Similarly Rg. X. 9 and 30 are hymns addressed to waters, in the former of which the waters are invoked to remove whatever sin or wrong one may have commit ted (Rg. X 9.8 'idam-āpaḥ pra vahata yat kinca duritam mayi') Atharya-veda I. 33 is a hymn addressed to waters, wherein also they are described as 'śrcayah pūvakah' (in A, V, I 33.1 and 4). The Vaj S. VI, 17 ( closely following Rg. X. 9. 8) invokes waters to remove whatever is censurable and dirty.729 In Vāj S. IV. 2 the sage prays 'May the Waters, our mothers, purify us !' 720 The Sat. Br. 1. 7. 4, 17 (S. B, E, vol. 12 p. 213) states' water is a means of purification. Viśvarūpa on Yaj. I 191 quotes a long Vedic passage 121 wherein it is said "what ever creates doubt (whether it is pure or impure) should be touched with waters; then it becomes pure." It is therefore that water (hot or cold) is said to be the purifier of various kinds of vessels and of the ground in Yāj. I. 182-183, 188. Manu V, 109, 112, 126. Gobhila (1. 31-32 ) 722 lays down that when & man engaged in any religious rite hears & mantra addressed to the pitrs, scratches his body, looks at a man of the lowest caste, or allows the wind to escape from his intestines, laughs loudly or speaks an untruth, touches a cat or a mouse, or uses harsh language, has a fit of anger, he should perform ācamana (or touch water). 

According to Yāj I 187 and Visnu Dh, S. 23.56 a polluted louse is purified by being swept and cowdunged. But more stringent rules were laid down if a dog, a śūdra, a patita, a mleccha or a candāla died in a brāhmana's house (vide note 633 abore). After keeping the house vacant for the periods

[Vol. stated in note 633, it is provided by Samvarta 22 that a house that is polluted by the existence of a corpse inside it should be dealt with as follows: earthen pots and cooked food should be cast away and thrown out of the house which sbould then be ameared with cowdung and then a goat should be made to go about in it smelling it and then the whole house should be sprinkled over with water in which gold and kisas are put in by brāhmadas rendered holy by the repetition of the Gayatri mantra; then the house becomes pure. Marici prescribes 224 that if a candāla (merely) entered a house, it can be purified by plastering it with oowdung, but if he were to stay in it Jong, purification can be had only by heating it and making flames of fire lick its walls. 

The ground in a brahmana's house, in a temple, in & 009 per should, says Yama, always be regarded as pure (unless it has been polluted). 

A great deal is said in the smrtis and digasts about the purifioation of yoter. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15, % says 725 in a general way that a person after sipping water from what is collected on the ground becomes pure But the Baud. Dh. s I 5. 65, Manu V, 128, Yaj. I. 192, Saṅkha 16. 12–13, Mārkandeya purāna 35.19 and others add that water collected on the ground that is of such yolume that & Cow can slake its thirst therein, that is in its natural state and is not polluted by any thing impure and that has natural colour (is transparent) and taste and odour (either no odour or a fragrant odour) is pure. Saṅkha says 726 the same about water collected on a stony surface and adds that the water of a flowing river is always pure. Deyala states 127 that water brought in Clean vessels is

pure but when it is (stale owing to its being stored) for one night (or more ) it should be thrown though it was pure (when originally brought). There 728 is no taint in water that cannot be agitated by any beings and in the water of springs (that flow from hills). Tanks (that are so deep) that they cannot be agitated, rivers, wells and lakes (that are similar) should not be used by the usual way of descent (the ghat) if they come in contact with capdalas and other impure persons or things, In Narhari v. Bhimrao, the Bombay High Court had to deal with the question whether a certain tank at Mahad in the Kolaba District could not be resorted to by untouchables for taking water and held that the untouchables were not prevented from using it (vide 39 Bombay L. R. R. 1295). 

Brhaspati provides that if in a well the dead body of an animal with five nails (man or beast) is found or if the well is otherwise extremely polluted all the water of the well should be taken out and the rest should be dried up by means of olothes, then if the well be built with burnt bricks flames of fire should be made (to liok the surface of the walls ), and then pancagavia should be poured over when fresh water begins to flow in (from the springs) 729, Āpastamba (g. by Suddhikaumudi p. 299 ) states the circumstances when a well may be said to be extre mely polluted: 'bair, exorements and urine, menstrual dis charge, a dead body-when a well is defiled by these one should take a hundred jars of water from it' (and further purification by putting pañcagavya in it should be resorted to if there is more water). Parāgara VII. 3 says the same about wells (with steps), wells without steps and tanks. 

Yāj. I 197 ( =Vispu Dh, S. 23. 41) provides that mud and rater on roads which come in contact with lowest castes ( like candalas), dogs and crows and buildings (like mathas) con structed with burnt bricks are purified by the wind alone

History of Dharmasastra (blowing on them ). Parāśara VII. 34 states 730 that mud and water on roads, boats, paths, grass and whatever is constructed with burnt bricks are rendered pure by the wind and the sun, 

Rain water after it fell on the ground was supposed to be impure 731 for ton days. Similarly Yogiyājāavalkya (q. by 8. K. p. 291) remarks that water of a river (dried up in summer) coming down in a flood for the first time ( after rains) should not be taken ( as pure) and also water that is agitated by some one (with the feat &c.) and waters that start in & separate stream by themselves from a holy river (like the Ganges ). Even when a well (without steps ) or a well (with & flight of steps) or a reservoir with a dam is constructed by men of the lowest castes, no prāyascitta is prescribed for bathing therein or for drinking water therefrom. 132 

Visnu Dh S 23, 46 provides 733 that the purification of small reservoirs of water that are static (i. e, froin which no stroams flow down ) is made in the game way as that of sells (without steps ), while in the case of large reservoirs no po]}u tion is recogaised. It is declared that waters are purified by the rays of the sun and the moon and the contact of the wind and by cowdung and the urine of cows; some of these ideas are supported by modern scientific discoveries,

Purity of drinking water

This shows that even in ancient times water was carried in leather bags or drums where there was scarcity of water and was allowed to be used even by twice-born people. 

We may now turn to the purification of metals and vessels. Baud, Dh. S. I. 5. 34-35 and I 6. 37-41, Vasistha III, 58 and 61-63, Manu V. 111-114, Yāj. I 182 and 190, Visnu 23.,2, 7, 23-24, Saṅkha 16. 3-4, Smrtyarthasāra p. 70 and others lay down rules about the purification of metals which do not agree in details. Therefore it is proposed to set out only what is said by Manu and one or tryo others. Manu (V. 113 ff.) says "The vise declare that the purification of metals (like gold ), of precious stones (like emerald), of all articles of stone is brought about by ashes, water and clay. Articles of gold that are not smeared (with dirty things like leavings of food &o.) become pure by means of water alone; the same holds good of articles that are found in water (ooral and shells ), that are made of stone and are made of silver on which no craftsmanship (such as drawing lines or figures ) has been expended, Gold and silver sprang forth through the union of water and fire; therefore their purification is brought about best by their causes, viz, water (in case of slight pollution) and fire (in case of extreme pollution). The purification of copper, iron, bell metal, brass, tin and lead should be brought about by salts (ashes ), acids and water according to circumstances (i. e. pollution caused). Vasistha (III, 58, 61-63) says: 'bell-metal is purified with ashes, gold and silver with water alone and copper with acids. Yāj. I. 190 says 'the purification of tin, lead and copper is brought about by salt water, acids and ordinary water, of bell-metal and iron by ashes and water,' The Lingapurāna (pūrvārdha, 189. 58) says: bell-metal is purified by ashes, iron articles by salt; copper, tin and lead by aoids; golden and silver vessels are purified by water and jewels, stones, conches and pearls are purified in the same way as metallic vessels. Vide Vāmanapurāna (14.70) which states that copper pots are purified by acids, tin and lead ones by salts, bell-metal by ashes and water. Medhātithi on Manu V, 114

Sātātapa has a similar verse (vide Par. M. vol II part 1p 172). 

Claborate rules are laid down about the purification of polluted pots and vessels used in ordinary life, in Baud. Dh, S. I. 5. 34-50, I 6. 33-42, Yaj. I 182-183, Visnu 23, 2-5, Santha 16. 1-5 and others. There is some variation in all these, but, as the Mit. on Yāj. I 190 remarks, it is not an absolute rule that coppor must be purified by acids alone but if purification is possible by other means, they may be resorted to It is not necessary to get out the different modes of purifying vessels, A passage from the Suddhi-prakāśa pp. 117–118 would be sufficient to indicate how this matter of põtrasuddhi (cleansing of polluted vessels) was dealt with in medieva) India. "vessels made of gold, silver, conches, shells, stones, precious stones, bell motal, brass, tin, lead are purified by mere water, provided they have no dirt or pollution sticking to thom, if these vessels are polluted by the contact of leavings of food &c. they are purified by ashes and water or acids and water according as anyone of these is appropriate; the vessels made of the above substances that are polluted for a long time owing to being used by śūdras or owing to contact with leavings of food should first be scoured with salts (ashes) and water three times and should be then cast into fire so long as it can be borne (without the vessels being broken, melted or burnt up) and then they become pure, Vessels of bell metal when polluted by only dogs, CrOWS, śūdras and leavings of food only once or licked by cows become pure by being scoured ten times with salts and water; but if they are polluted by the above several times then they have to be scoured 21 times for becoming pure, If in a vessel belonging to the three higher varnas a sūdra takes hia meal, it becomes pure after being washed four times with salts and being cast in fire and then taken up with hands that are washed clean with water. A Yessel of bell-metal that is polluted once by the leavings of a

Purification of metallic pots

A vessel of ball-metal that is polluted by being frequently used for holding the water expelled from the mouth after rinsing it or the water in which the feet are washed should be buried in the ground for six months, then heated in fire and then it becomes pure (compare Parāśara VII. 24-25); but if it is polluted thus only once it becomes pure after (being buried in the ground) for ten days All metal vessels polluted for a short time by the bodily dirts such as urine, excrement, semen become pure after being placed for seven nights in cow's urine or in a great river; but if they are polluted as above many times or are polluted by the contact of a corpse, a freshly dalivered woman or a woman in her monthly course they become pure after being thrice washed with salts, acids and water and after being heated in fire till they can bear it, but if these are polluted by urine and for a long time and frequently they become pure by being beaten into shape (manufactured) again, 

Visnu ( 23.2 and 5 ) provides that all metal vessels when extremely polluted ( as stated in note 710) are purified by being cast into fire and that vessels of wood or clay when extremely polluted should be given up, but Dovala 736 and others provide that wooden vessels when slightly polluted become pure by being planed or chiselled or by means of clay, cowdung or water and that earthon vessels if not extremely polluted become pure by being baked in fire 737 (also Yaj. I, 187). But Vas. II. 59 provides that an earthon vessel if polluted by the contact of wines, urino, excrement, phlegm, tears, pus and blood is not purified even by being burnt in fire. 738 

Special rules are provided for the purification of vessels and implements used in Vedic sacrifices. Baud. Dh, S. (I, 5, 51-52 ) 739 remarks that the camasa vessels used in sacrifices

are purified according to the special Vedic texts, since the Veda says that camasa vegsels do not inour the fault of being ucchrṣia when it is soma liquid that is drunk from them. Manu V, 116-117, Yā). I 183-185, Visnu Dh S. 23.8-11, Saṅkha 16.6. Parāśara VII, 2-3 and others lay down rules about the purifioation of sacrificial implements. For example, Manu (V. 116-117 ) provides 'sacrificial vessels should be first rubbed with the right hand (or with darbhas or straider) and then camasas and cups are to be washed with water before using them in the sacrifice; the carusthali (the vessel in which the oblation of boiled rice is prepared), sruc (a wooden vessel used for pouring olarified butter on sacrificial fire), and gruva (wooden ladle of a semiciroular shape) ara purified by being washed with hot water; the sphya (wooden sword), the win noving basket, the cart (for bringing the goma plant), wooden mortar and pestle, are purified with water (or sprinkling water acoording to Yaj. I. 184). 

Several rules were laid down about the purification of palluted corn and polluted cooked food. A referenco has already been made to the purification of heaps of corn Common 28780, convenience and the loss that may be caused by very stringent provisions are the considerations which prompt the rules on this subject. Visau 23.25 provides 740 that whora & heap of rice (or other grain) is polluted, one should throw away only that portion of it which is actually defiled and should submit the rest to pounding and washing with water; cooked food that exceeds in vodume one drona and that bas been defiled does not all become tainted, but that throwing away the defiled portion alone, one should sprinkle over the rest water mixed with gold on which the sacred Gayatri verse has been repeated and should hold it before a goat to see it and should also bring fire near it. Vide Baud. Dh, S, I G. 44-48. "If grains of rico are polluted they slould ba washed and dried. But if it is a large quantity then sprinkling with water is enough; husked rice (if polluted) should be cast away. The same rule applios to cooked offerings. But in the case of large heaps of cooked food that portion which is polluted by dogs or crows should be cast away and the rest should be sprinkled with the Antral ?

What is polluted food

Fide 741 that one should not partake of food that was cooked along with hair and insects (like ants), nor food that is polluted by the contact of a woman in her monthly illness, by a crow or by being struck with the foot (of some one). But where food is already cooked and then it is smelt by a cow or it is polluted by the falling into it of hair, insects, flies, then Yāj. I. 189 and Parāśara VI.64-65 provide that in order to purify it water, ashes (with water) or loose earth ( with water) should be cast over it. Āp. Dh. S. I. 516. 24-29 provide that one should not partake of food in which hair exists (i, e it was there from the beginning) or anything else (like nails) that is impure or of food that is touched with an unclean substance or in which an insect that subsists on impure things exists or food which is struck by the feet of any person or in which the excrement or the tail (or Jimb) of a rat is found 

The general rule is stated by Manu V. 118 which applies not only to corn and clothes but to many other articles viz. if there is a heap or a large quantity then sprinkling with water (prokṣana ) sufices for purification but if the quantity is small then Tashing with water is necessary. Manu V. 125 ( = Viṣnu Dh. S. 23.38) provides that (a small quantity of) cooked food part of which is pecked by birds (whose flesh is eaten by men), which is smelt by a cow, which is struck with the foot (by a man) and over which some one has speezed or which is polluted by the falling in of hair and insects becomes pure by casting into it loose earth (and water). Parāśara (VI. 71-74) puts the matter 72 thus: "food licked by dogs and crows of smelt by a cor or ass, if littje in quantity, should be thrown &tray by a brahmana, but purification should be resorted to if it is a drona or adhaka in quantity. That portion which is defiled by the saliva of a dog or crow should be thrown away and water in which gold is put should be sprinkled over the remainjng portion, then flames of fire should lick the remaining

History of Dharmaśāstra food and brahmadas should loudly recite Vedic hymns (like the Payamābasūkta) over it and then the food becomes fit for eating". The Suddhiprakasa explains that the wealthy should not throw away food if it is more than a drona in quantity and & poor man if it is more than an adhaba 743. 

Manu V. 115 744 says that in the case of all liquids (such as oils, ghee &o.) purification (when they are little in quantity) is brought about by means of two kuśas dipped into them (or by straining them through a piece of cloth into another pot) and if the quantity is large then by sprinkling (water). Saṅkha provides 745 that purification is brought about by mere proksana in the case of all exudations (Asafoetida &c.), jaggery, salts, gafflower, saffron and in the case of wool and cotton, Vide note 705 above about certain articles baing pure the moment they are transferred from the pots of even mlecchas &c. 

A few words may be said about the purification of different kinds of cloth and garments and the materials of which they are made. Laghu-Asyalāyana (I. 28-30) provides that a white garment is always commended for wearing (as a dhol), but they bre commended for wearing as upper garments and both are not defiled by the touch of anybody. Men may take their food or answer calls of nature while covered with both; trasara is purified by being washed while a sijken garment is always pure. Manu V. 120-121, Yay I 186-187 and Visnu (23. 19-22) provide almost in the same words that silken and woollen cloth is cleansed by saline earth (and with water and cow's urine ), Nepalese blankets by the powder of soap berry, clothes made of tree bark with Bilva fruit and linen cloth by (paste of) white mustard, Vispu 23. 6 says 746 that when a garment is extremely polluted that portion thereof which when washed with water loses its colour should be cut off.

Purification of garments 

rūpa on Yāj. 1.182 prescribes that garments are purified by being submitted to hot steam, by washing with water or by cutting off only that portion that is defiled. Parāśara VIL. 28 provides that garments made from banuboos and barks of trees, linen and cotton garments, garments of wool and birch bark are purified by mere proksana. 

The smrtis speak of purification of many other things, which is of little importance and is passed over here. Only a few illustrations are given here. Manu, V, 119 provides that skins and things made of split bamboos (or canes) are cleaned in the same way as Clothes, while vegetables, roots and fruits are purified on the analogy of grain. Manu V. 120-121 state that the purification of conches, horns (of buffaloes and rams) and bones and tusks (of the elephant or boar) is to be caused in the same way as that of linen or with cow's urine or water and that grass, wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled with water. Visou Dh. S. 23, 15, 16, 23 and Yaj. I. 185 are very similar. 

From the above it will be clear that purification of subst ances depends on many circumstances, viz. whether they are metalic or are earthen, whether they are solid or liquid, whether a polluted substance is small in quantity or is a big heap, whether the pollution is extremne or insignificant and 80 on, 

In Manu the purification of substances follows (V. 110) the means of purifying one's own body, Purification of the body by means of acamana and snana (bath) has already been described in H. of Dk, vol II. pp. 315-316 and 652-653 (about aoamana), 656-668 (about snāna). Purification by bath on asauca has already been dealt with before. Special rules were prescribed for vomen guilty of adultery (vide H, of Dh. Yol. II. p. 594, vol. II, pp. 647-649), as also for women raped (vide Vol. II p. 575). Snāna (bath) with the clothes on was prescribed for purification of the body when & person touches one who is patita (murderer of a brābmapa &c.), & capdala, a woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, & corpse or one who has touched a corpse; also when a man follows a funeral procession or touches a dog (vide Gaut. 14. 28-30, Mann V. 85 and 103, Angiras verse 152, Ap. Dh. S. L. 5. 15. 15–16, Yāj III, 30). Baud. Dh S I. 5. 140 provides that on touching one who sells the Veda (teaches it for money), & vūpa, & funeral pyre, a patita, a dog and a Cāndāla one should

undergo a bath 748 Parāśara also has a similar Terse,719 It has already been stated elsewrhere (in H. of Dh rol. II. pp 175-176) how the rules about touching untouchables were related then people congregated in a temple or in a religious procession, ale marriages and festivals and at holy places. It is said by some that this refers not to the so-called untouchables, but to men who are untouchable owing to āśauc. But this is not correct The explanation of the Suddhi-kaunudi and Suddhiprakasa given below makes it clear that the untouchables are meant In the first place, the words are quite general and not restricted. In the second place, there is no untouchability (except for the mother) on the ground of Jaranāśauca and it is most unlikels that a person who has incurred mourning on death should risit a temple or go to a marriage or enter & religious procession, or festival. In the third place, looking to the sereral occasions mentioned together (particularly pilgrimages, battles, firo in a town or village and commotion or invasion of a country) it appears most unlikely that the rerse refers only to aśauca on birth and death, 750 

The ancient and medieval Indians put Tery great enphasis on purity of mind, of body, of the place there they resided or performed religious rites, of the resse)s used by them and of the ingredients of thoir food and Torship. Many of the rules about purification of substances may appear to modern minds as very stringont; but it should 110$ be forgotten that the ancient Indians fere imbued with the thought that purity of the mind followed from purity of food

Reason of emphasis on purification 

333 

(as stated in the Chandogyopanisad VII, 26,2 fahārasuddhau sattvasuddbih' and by Harita). It would be conceded that some of their rules about purification (such as about large quantities of corn or heaps of cooked food) are based on common sense and convenience. We are probably going to the other extreme in taking our food anywhere and in any surroundings.
