CHAPTER VIII

SUDDHI


Śuddhi (purification ) is a very comprehensive topic including within it purification after āśauca (impurity on birth and death), purification of a person after contact with an impure object or on account of certain occurrences. purification of pots, wells, food &c., after they are polluted. Aśauca, however, is the most important subject under śuddhi and therefore the Śuddhi.kaumudi 'defines 'śuddhi' as 'the state of being fit for or capable of performing the rites that are understood from the Veda'[^596]. The Smṛtis employ the word śuddhi in relation to purification after āśauca. For example, Manu V.57 starts by saying that he will expound purification after a man is dead ( pretaśuddhi) and purification of things (dravyaśuddhi). Manu V. 83 ( = Dakṣa VI. 7) avers that a brāhmaṇa becomes pure after ten days (on the death or birth of a relative), a kṣatriya after twelve &c. The Parāśara-smṛti starts chapter three by declaring 'I shall expound śuddhi on birth and death.' Yaj. III. 14, 25 also employ the word śuddhi. Therefore aśauca on birth and death will be first dealt with.

## āśauca
The word _āśauca_ is formed from suci (pure) according to Pan. V. 1.131 [^596a] and Pān. VII. 3, 30 (vide note below) with the negative particle _na_ (a). In some smṛtis such as that of Devala the form 'āśucya' also is found (see Hāralatā pp. 2, 9, 36 in quotations from Devala[596b]). Another word which is often used as a synonym for āśauca is 'agha'. It has been seen above (p. 6) that the word _agha_ means 'sin' in the Vedic Literature (as in Ṛg. I. 97, 1-8, X. 117.6). But in the Sān, Śr. IV. 15. 11, Manu V. 84 (na vardhayed-aghāhāni) the word 'agha' has come to mean the same thing as āśauca[^597]. The Padmapurāṇa II. 66. 73-74 states that since the outlets of the body always emit mucus, urine &c. it is always impure.

[^596]: वेदबोधितकर्माहता शुद्धिः । शु. कौ. p. 1.

[^596a]: इगन्ताच्च लघुपूर्वात्। पा. V. 1. 131 (अण् अनुवर्तते)-शुचेर्भावः कर्म वा शौचम् । न शौचमशौचम् ।. This is one way of explaining the word. We may also explain न शुचि अशुचि, अशुचेर्भावः कर्म च आशौचं or अशौचं according to मनः शुचीश्वरक्षेत्रजकुशलनिपुणानाम् । (पा. VII. 3. 30).

[^596b]: जनने मरणे नित्यमाशुच्यमनुधावति। देवल q. by हारलता p. 2; आशुच्यं दशरात्रं तुं सर्वत्राप्यपरे विदुः । देवल q. by शुद्धिप्र. p. 41.
[^597]: नाघाहानि वर्धयेयुरिति ह स्माह कौषीतकिः । शां. श्रौ. IV. 15.11. The com. says 'अघशद्वेनात्र मरणमुच्यते। येष्वहःसु सपिण्डमरणं संवृत्तं तान्यघाहानि मरणादारभ्यै करात्रादीनि यानि व्रतैर्व्या॑प्तान्युक्तानि तानि न वर्धयेयुः नाभ्यधिकानि कुर्युः। कर्मानधिकारव्रतैर्न व्याप्नुयुः ।'.

The Mit. on Yāj. III. 1 defines[^598] āśauca as an emergent attribute attaching to a person, which is got rid of by lapse of time or a bath and the like and which is the cause of the positive direction to offer to a deceased person) piṇḍa, water and the like and of the cessation of Vedic study and other actions. The Mit. adds that āśauca is not merely the absence of the privilege or power to do religious acts, since even those who have incurred impurity (on death &c.) are enjoined to do certain religious acts such as offering water (to the deceased). This definition of the Mit, appears to be an echo of the Garudapuraṇa ( pretakhaṇḍa) 5. 9 and is probably based on a verse of the work called Saṅgraha. Haradatta[^599] on Gautama 14. 1 states that āśauca may be defined as the absence of the privilege to perform religious acts, unfitness for being one whose food may be partaken of, untouchability and the loss of the privilege to make religious gifts. A comparatively early writer Bhaṭṭācārya[^600], appears to have defined 'śuddhi' as the 'removal of sin' or as 'being fit for performing religious acts'. This was accepted by the Smṛti-candrikā, but rejected by Nandapaṇḍita, commentator of Ṣadaśīti (pp. 2-3). Even the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 18) emphasizes that āśaucas has two characteristics, viz. it takes away the privilege of performing religious acts and it renders a person untouchable. The Smṛtimuktāphala follows this.

[^598]: आशौचशद्धेन च कालस्नानाद्यपनोद्यः पिण्डोदकदानादिविधेः अध्ययनादिपर्युदासस्य च निमित्तभूतः पुरुषगतः कश्चनातिशयः कथ्यते न पुनः कर्मानधिकारमात्रम् । मिता. on या.

[^600]: शुद्धिशद्वार्थस्तु पापक्षयः शुद्धिर्धर्मयोग्यत्वमेव वा इति भट्टाचार्योक्तो द्रष्टवयः। पापक्षयः सपिण्डादौ जनने मरणे वा तत्सम्बन्ध्यादावुत्पन्नस्य पापविशेषस्य क्षयः । धर्मयोग्यत्वं दानादिधर्मानुष्ठानार्हत्वम्। एवं शुद्धिशद्वार्थो मतभेदेन द्विधा विवृतो भट्टाचार्यः। स्मृतिच (आशौचकाण्ड p.2). स्मृतिमु. p. 477 mentions this view.

### Two characteristics of āśauca

Rudradhara in his Śuddhiviveka (D. C. ms, No. 309 of 1887-91 folio 1) says that śuddhi is a special attribute which brings about a capacity or privilege for the performance of all dharmas, while aśuddhi is an attribute opposed to śuddhi and arises on the occasion of the birth of a sapiṇḍa or the like[^601].

Āśauca is of two kinds, viz, that arising on birth[^602] (and so called _jananāśauca_ or _sūtaka_) and that arising on death (and therefore called _śāvāśauca_ or _mṛtakāśauca_ or _maraṇāśauca_). _Śāva_ is derived from _śava_ (meaning a corpse). The word sūtaka occurs in the[^603] Ait. Br. (chap. 32.8) and is there probably used in the sense of impurity on both birth and death. There it is said that if an āhitāgni partook of food from the house of him who was affected by sūtaka, then the prāyaścitta was to offer a _puroḍāśa_ cooked on eight potsherds to Agni Tantumat. Tantu means also 'son or progeny' and so it may be argued that it is an indication that sūtaka is used in the Ait. Br. in the sense of impurity on birth. The word _sūtaka_ is used in the smṛtis in three senses: 

1) impurity on birth (vide Manu V. 58); 
2) impurity both on birth and death, as in Gobhilasmṛti III. 6) and 63;[^604] 
3) impurity on death alone (as in Dakṣa VI. 1 and Gobhilasmṛti III. 48 )[^605]. 
   
In some of the modern vernaculars (such as Marathi) the word "sūtaka' is used in the 3rd sense alone. In each of these two divisions there are two varieties viz. where the duration is brief or comparatively long (Ṣaḍaśiti, verse 2).

[^601]: शुद्धिस्तावदखिलधर्माधिकारापादको धर्मविशेषः। अशुद्धिस्तु तद्विरोधी धर्मविशेष एव । स च सपिण्डजन्मादिनिमित्तकः। शुद्धिविवेक of रुदधर.

[^602]: आशौचं द्विविधं कर्मानधिकारलक्षणं स्पृश्यत्वलक्षणं च । स्मृतिमु. (p. 477).

[^603]: तदाहुर्य आहिताग्निर्यदि सूतकान्नं प्राश्नीयाका तत्र प्रायश्चित्तिरिति। सोऽग्नये तन्तुमतेऽष्टाकपालं पुरोडाशं निर्वपेत्तस्य याज्यानुवाक्ये तन्तुं तन्वन्रजसो भानुमान्वह्याक्षानहो नह्यतनोत सोम्या इति। आहुतिं वाहवनीये जुहुयादग्नये तन्तुमते स्वाहेति । ऐ. बा. 32. 8. तन्तुं तन्वन is Ṛg. x. 53 6 and अक्षानहा is Ṛg. x. 53. 7.

[^604]: सूतके कर्मणां त्यागः सन्ध्यादीनां विधीयते । होमः श्रौतस्तु कर्तव्यः शुष्कान्नेनापि वा फलैः॥ गोभिलस्मृति called छन्दोगपरिशिष्ट q. by हारलता p.6, शु, को. and श्राद्धप्र. p. 83.

[^605]: सूतकं तु प्रवक्ष्यामि जन्ममृत्युनिमित्तकम् । यावज्जीवं तृतीयं तु यथावदनुपूर्वशः॥ दक्ष. VI. 1; अस्थ्नामलाभे पार्णानि शकलान्युक्तयावृता। भर्जयेदस्थिसंख्यानि ततः प्रभृति सूतकम् ॥ गोभिल III. 48. The 4th pada of the latter is q. by हारलता p.2.

A question arises why birth and death should cause impurity to the members of the family or to relatives, Only a few have to say anything on this question, Hārita says: 

> the family incurs death impurity because by death the family feels overwhelmed (or frustrated), while when a new life appears the family increases (and there is gratification or joy)[^606].


[^606]: अस्य च कुलव्यापित्वे कारणमाह हारीतः । प्रेताभिभूतत्वाच्छावमाशौचं जीवे वृद्धियोगेन कुलस्य भवति । इति । जायमानम्रियमाण्योः सम्बन्धिनां सन्तोषदासन्तोषदाभ्यां वृद्धिक्षययोगाद्वा कुलव्याप्याशौचं भवतीत्यर्थः। शुद्धिचन्द्रिका on षडशीति p.4. The स्मृतिच. (आशौच) P.11 reads somewhat differently “नन्वघरूपाशौचं सपिण्डव्यतिरिक्तानां न भवति कारणाभावादित्याशङ्क्याह हारीतः 'प्रेताभिभूतत्वाच्छावाशौचं जाते वृद्धियोगेन केनेति मीमांसन्ते नाभ्यच्छिन्नकालानामुच्छेदभूयस्त्वाच्च कुलस्याशोचं भवति। इति । ."


### Conflict of smṛtis on āśauca

The literature on Śuddhi (including āśauca) is very extensive. Apart from the sūtras, smṛtis and Purāṇas there are numerous digests dealing with the subject at great length. Some of them have been printed. The smṛtis contain a mass of contradictory dicta to such an extent and different from the usages of medieval times that the Mit. on Yaj. III. 22 after quoting the views of Parāśara, Śatātapa, Vasiṣṭha and Aṅgiras on the periods for which impurity had to be observed by persons belonging to the four varṇas refuses to evolve order out of then and remarks that the usages in its day were different from the dicta of those sages[^607]. The Madana-pārijāta (p. 392) agrees with the Mit. and also suggests other modes of dealing with the conflict. Two examples may be cited of the way in which different smṛtis approach the same problem. 

#### Exclusions for the learned
Atri 83, Parāśara III, 5 and Dakṣa VI, 6 provide that a brāhmaṇa who has consecrated the three Vedic fires and has mastered the Veda becomes free from impurity (on birth and death ) in one day, one who has merely mastered the Veda ( but has not consecrated the śrauta fires ) in three days and one who is devoid of both in ten days. Manu V.59 gives various options viz. 10 days, 4 days, 3 days, 1 day but does not state explicitly to whom his remarks apply.

[^607]: इत्येवमनेकोच्चावचाशौचकल्पा दर्शिताः। तेषां लोके समाचाराभावान्नातीव व्यवस्थाप्रदर्शनमुपयोगीति नात्र व्यवस्था प्रदर्श्यते । मिता on या. III. 22: लोकसमाचारादनादरणीयमिति केचन। अथवा देशाचारतो व्यवस्था। उत गुणवदगुणवद्विषये यथाक्रमं न्यूनाधिककल्पाश्रयेण निर्वाहः । किंवा आपदनापद्भेदेन व्यवस्था। मद. पा. p. 392.


Bṛhaspati[^607a] (q. by Hāralatā p. 5 and Haradatta on Gautama 14. 1) states that a brāhmaṇa who is endowed with Veda and śrauta fires becomes pure after three days, one who is devoid of śrauta fires (but is master of the Veda) in five days and one who is only a brāhmaṇa by caste (has not studied the Veda or does not teach it ) in ten days. The Sān, Sr. and Manu[^608] (both quoted above) urge a man not to increase through laziness the number of days for which impurity is to be observed. It is possible that persons claiming to be learned observed impurity for a few days only, while neighbours disputed their claim to this special dispensation in favour of Vedic learning and keeping śrauta fires. The result was that later on a flat number of ten days was prescribed for all brāhmaṇas whether learned or not and the provision for lesser number of days of impurity was relegated to _Kalivarjya_ usages. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 941-42.

#### Caste
Another example of the dependence of the days of impurity on the caste of the deceased and of varying dicta thereon may be cited. 

- Manu V. 83, Dakṣa VI. 7, Yāj. III. 22, Atri (verse 85), Sankha (15. 2-3), Matsyapurāṇa (18. 2-3), Brahmapuraṇa 220.63, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 22. 1-4, all lay down periods of 10 days, 12 days, 15 days and a month for impurity among brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras respectively. 
- Yaj. III.22 makes the virtuous śūdra observe impurity only for 15 days as a concession. 
- Gaut. (15.1-4) prescribes 10, 11, 12 days (or half month) and a month respectively for the four _varṇas_, while Vas. (4.27-30) gives the periods of 10, 15, 20 and one month for the four varṇas. 
- Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar, in his article on Nāgara brāhmaṇas and Kāyasthas of Bengal, protests that the Kāyasthas of Bengal (owing to social tyranny) still observe āśauca for one month as if they are ordinary śūdras (I. A. for 1932 at p. 71). 
- On the other hand, Aṅgiras ( quoted by the Mit, on Yaj. III, 22 ) states that śātātapa declared that all _varṇas_ become purified after ten days whether the impurity is due to birth or death[^609].

POONA
[^607a]: त्रिरात्रेण विशुध्येत योऽग्निवेदसमन्वितः। पञ्चाहेनाग्निहीनस्तु दशाहाद् बाह्मणब्रुवः॥ बृहस्पति पू. by कल्प० (शुद्धि) p.4, हारलता p. 5 and शु को. p.7. अङ्गिरस defines ब्राह्मणब्रुव as 'गर्भाधानादिसंस्कारैर्युक्तश्च नियमव्रतैः । नाध्यापयति नाधीते विज्ञेयो ब्राह्मणब्रुवः॥'.

#### sāpiṇḍya
Parāśara (III. 9) quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 18 provides that a _sapiṇḍa_ who is 4th in descent from the common ancestor of the deceased and himself becomes pure after ten days, one who is 5th after 6 days, one who is 6th in descent after four days and one who is 7th after one day. The Mit. says that this should be discarded as it is in conflict with many other smṛtis and is disapproved of by people[^610]. 

#### Child death
The Mit, on Yaj. III, 18 declares that when a child that has not completed two years dies, it is the parents that have to observe āśauca for ten days and not all sapiṇḍas and that their āśauca entails untouchability for them. 

#### Vijñāneśvara
Some of the rules mentioned by Vijñāneśvara (about 1100 A. D.) themselves underwent changes in 500 years as noted by the Nirṇayasindhu (composed in 1612 A. D.[^611]).

The Nirṇayasindhu (p. 517) remarks that what Vijñānesvara said is not now (in its time) the usage and that the Smṛtyarthasāra also did not accept Vijñāneśvara's view.

[^610]: यत्पुनः स्मृत्यन्तरवचनम्-चतुर्थे दशरात्रं स्यात्षण्निशाः पुंसि पञ्चमे। षष्ठे चतुरहाच्छुद्धिः सप्तमे त्वहरेव तु॥ इति तद्विगीतत्वान्नादरणीयम् । यद्यप्यविगीतं तथापि मधुपर्काङ्गपश्चालम्भनवल्लोकविद्विष्टत्वान्नानुष्ठेयम्। अस्वर्ग्ये लोकविद्विष्टं धर्म्यमप्याचरेन्न तु-इति मनुस्मरणात् । मिता. on या. III. 18. अस्वर्ग्ये० is the latter half of या. I. 156.

[^611]: यत्तु विज्ञानेश्वरेणोक्तं ऊनद्विवर्ष उभयोः सूतकं मातुरेव हीति याज्ञवल्क्योक्तिः गर्भस्थे प्रेते मातुर्दशाहं जात उभयोः कृते नाम्नि सोदराणां च इति पैङ्गयोक्तेश्च पित्रोः सोदराणां च दशाहमस्पृश्यत्वमिति <u> तन्नेदानीं प्रचरति </u> । अत एव स्मृत्यर्थसारे तन्नादृतम्। निर्णयसिन्धु p. 517. The स्मृत्यर्थसार (p. 80 ) states 'अनुपनीतमरणे मातापित्रोर्दशाहाशौचपक्षोऽनादृतः ।'

### Works on āśauca
In view of the above-mentioned circumstances no useful purpose would be served by setting out in detail the varying dicta of the smṛtis, Purāṇas[^612] and the digests upon the several matters that fall to be treated under āśauca. Digests on this subject are too numerous to mention. The following printed ones and a few mss, have been made use of in preparing the following account. In the first place, there are several works that deal with this subject in verse. 

[^612]: Several among the Purāṇas devote considerable space to āśauca. For example, the Kūrma (Uttarārdha Chap. 23), Lingapurāṇa (Purvārdha Chapter 89. 77-92), Garuḍapurāṇa (Pretakhaṇḍa Chap. 5), Agnipurāṇa (Chapters 157-158), Vāmana (14.96-102) do so. In the Garuḍapurāṇa n (Pretakhaṇḍa 5) several verses are taken from Yājñavalkya, Manu and others smṛtis.

The Aśaucāṣṭaka attributed to Vararuci (published in the Trivandrum series) with a commentary by an anonymous writer that names the bhāṣya of Maskarin on Gautama-dharmasūtra (on p. 35) deals with the subject in eight _sragdharā_ verses.

The Aśaucadaśaka or Daśaśloki attributed to Vijñāneśvara seems to have been a very popular work. There are several commentaries on it. The one by Harihara is the earliest of them. In the Deccan College collection of Mss (now at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona) there are several Mss of it, two of which were copied in _saṁvat_ 1539 (D. C. No. 216 of 1879-80) and _saṁvat_ 1579 (D.C, No. 196 of 1884-87) and which expressly state that the work was composed by Vijñāneśvara-yogindra. The ten śārdūlavikridita verses of the Aśaucadaśaka are set out in the appendix. 

The Kalpataru of Lakṣmīdhara has a section on śuddhi which has been recently published in the G.O.S. 

The Hāralatā of Aniruddha is very useful (B. I. Series). 

The Aśaucakānda of the Smr̥ticandrikā has been edited by the late Dr. Shamsastry and published as No. 56 of the Mysore University Sanskrit publications. 

The Tr̥imśacchloki with the commentary of Raghunatha composed in _śake_ 1645 has been published at the Poona Ānandaśrama press and contains 30 Sragdharā verses on āśauca. 

The Ṣaḍaśīti ( 86 verses in the Anuṣṭubh metre ) of Kauśikāditya with the commentary Śuddhicandrikā by Vināyaka _alias_ Nandapaṇḍita (composed about 1600 A. D.) has been published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. 

The Śuddhikaumudi of Govindānanda (B. I. Series ); the Śuddhitattva of Raghunandana (ed. by Jivananda pp. 233-412), the Śuddhiprakāśa (part of the Viramitrodaya of Mitramiśra ) published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series, the Śuddhimayūkha of Nilakaṇṭha (edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) and the Smṛtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha (edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) are compilations that are useful in their own way. 

These exhaustive treatises on āśauca show one thing unmistakably that brāhmaṇas of the medieval ages attached an extremely exaggerated importance to ceremonial purity of the body on birth and death.

### Periods
The periods of impurity depended on many circumstances. There was a difference between impurity on birth and that on death; so also the duration depended upon whether the deceased was an infant or a male or a female or one whose _upanayana_ had been performed or not performed; it depended on caste and also on the question whether the deceased died near the relative or far away; also upon the degree of relationship; and on the time that elapsed from the birth or death till it reached the ears of the relative. The intensity of impurity was different in each of the following: a sūtikā (a freshly delivered woman), _rajasvalā_ (woman in monthly illness ), impurity on death, impurity on birth (the last being the least).

Dakṣa (VI, 2-3) states that there are ten varieties in impurity, viz. immediate purity ( after taking a bath ), one day, three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fortnight, a month and till the end of one's life[^613]. Dakṣa then explains in what cases these different periods apply. As to what is meant by impurity till life's end (lit, till he is reduced to ashes), Dakṣa ( VI. 8-10 ) says: 'those who take their meals without bathing or offering to gods or without making gifts all such persons are in impurity till life ends. One who is permanently afflicted with a disease, who is close-fisted (i.e. stints himself, wife and son and religious acts through greed), who is always in debt (i. e. who has not paid off his debts to gods, sages and manes), who is bereft of religious acts ( _nitya_ or _naimittika_), who is a fool and is under the thumb of his wife, whose mind is bent on vices (gambling, prostitution &c. ), who is always dependent (a king's servant or the like), who is devoid of faith and benevolence (charitable gifts) -he incurs impurity which ends only with his ashes (i.e, only when he is cremated)[^614]. These words are not to be taken literally; what is meant is that such a man is to be shunned by others (i.e, it is an _arthavāda_ conveying merely censure).

[^613]: सद्यःशौचं तथैकाहस्त्र्यहश्चतुरहस्तथा। षड्दशद्वादशाहाश्च पक्षो मासस्तथैव च ॥ मरणान्तं तथा चान्यद् दश पक्षास्तु सूतके। दक्ष VI. 2-3, referred to by विश्वरूप on या. III. 30 and q. by कल्प० (on शुद्धि) p. 5, अपरार्क p. 894, परा. मा. I, 2. p. 207.

[^614]: अस्मात्वा चाप्यत्वा च ह्यदत्त्वा ये भुञ्जते । एवंविधानां सर्वेषां यावज्जीवं तु सूतकम् ॥ व्याधितस्य कदर्यस्य ऋणग्रस्तस्य सर्वदा। क्रियाहीनस्य मूर्खस्य स्त्रीजितस्य विशेषतः। ध्यसनासक्तचित्तस्य पराधीनस्य नित्यशः। श्रद्धात्यागविहीनस्य भस्मान्तं सूतकं भवेत्॥ दक्ष VI. 8-10 q. by विश्वरूप on या. III. 30, कल्प० (on शुद्धि) p. 15, हारलता p. 14, अपरार्क p. 895. The last verse of षडशीति is to the same effect as the first verse quotes above. The कूर्म (उत्त.) 23. 9 provides 'क्रियाहीनस्य मूर्खस्य महारोगिण एव च यथेष्टाचरणस्येह मरणान्तमशौचकम् ॥' q. by हारलता p. 15.

### Impurity on birth
We shall now turn to the impurity on birth.

That the impurity on birth lasted for ten days even in Vedic times can be inferred from the story of Śunaḥ-śepa narrated in the Ait. Br. (chapter 33, 2), where occurs the passage 'when the animal is more than ten days from birth he becomes pure (and fit to be offered in sacrifice).' The same inference can probably be drawn from Tai. Br, II, 1. 1.3, where it is said 'therefore people do not take the milk of a cow for ten nights when a calf is born'[^615].

#### srāva, pāta, prasava
Abortion in the first four months[^616] of pregnancy is called _srāva_, abortion in the 5th or 6th month is called _pāta_ and from the 7th month of pregnancy onwards it is called _prasūti_ or _prasava_ ( according to Parāśara III, 16, Ṣadasiti verse 9). 

#### srāva and pāta
When there is _srāva_ the mother incurs impurity for three days, in the case of _pāta_ the mother has to observe impurity for as many days as correspond to the months of pregnancy (i. e. 5 days or 6 days). 

The impurity consists in the mother being untouchable. The father alone has to bathe when there is _srāva_, but when there is _pāta_ the father and sapiṇḍas have to observe impurity for three days (according to Madana-pārijāta p. 380-381 and others) but they don't incur impurity as on death. These rules hold good for all castes. 

#### prasava
But when the foetus comes out dead in any month from the 7th or the child is still-born, then the impurity is for ten days for both parents and the sapiṇḍas for all varṇas or for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varṇas as laid down in Yāj. (III. 22 ) and the samānodakas have to observe āśauca for three days and sagotras for one day (Dharmasindhu p. 427). The above rules are more or less laid down by Gautama 14. 15-16, Baud. Dh, S. I, 5, 136, Parāśara III, 24, Manu V. 66, Yāj. III. 20 (latter half) and the first verse of Āśaucadaśaka. 

The mother is untouchable for ten days on birth, still-birth or abortion in 7th, 8th or 9th month but the father and sapiṇḍas[^617] when they take a bath after the _prasava_ are not untouchable (Yaj. III. 19). 

[^615]: अजनि वै ते पुत्रो यजस्व माऽनेनेति । स होवाच यदा वै पशुनिर्दशो भवत्यथ स मेध्यो भवति । ऐ. बा 33.2; तस्माद्वत्सं जातं दशरात्रीर्म दुहन्ति । ते. बा. II. 1.1.3.

III. 20, हरदत्त on गौ. 14.15, स्मृतिच. (आशौच) p. 4. The first is पराशर III. 16 and is quoted as such in शुद्धिप्र. p. 16.

[^617]: Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-455 for the meaning of sapiṇḍa and samānodaka (H. of Dh, vol. III. pp. 752-753). These words mean in this section generally (unless otherwise expressly stated) persons descended from a common male ancestor through unbroken male descents.

In ancient times there were several differing views about _jananāśauca_ for the father as vouched for by Baud[^618] Dh. S. I. 5. 125-128.

[^618]: जनने तावन् मातापित्रोर् दशाहम् आशौचम् । मातुर् इत्येके। तत्-परिहरणात् । पितुर् इत्य् अपरे - शुक्रप्राधान्यात् । अयोनिजा ह्य् अपि पुत्राः श्रूयन्ते मातापित्रोरेव तु संसर्ग-स्रामाभ्वात् । बौ.ध.सू. 1. 5. 125-128 q. by स्मृतिच. (आशौच) p. 9.


Although a woman becomes touchable in ten days after delivery she is not fit to take part in religious rites for 20 days after she becomes touchable (i. e. 30 days from birth ) if she gave birth to a son but for 30 days (i.e. 40 days from birth) if a daughter was born[^619]. Women of all varṇas become pure (i.e. touchable) ten days after delivery--says Pracetas[^620]. Devala states that there is no āśauca on the ground of birth when the period of (ten or twelve ) days has expired[^621]. 

If a woman was delivered at her father's or brother's house, then her parents and her brothers staying with the father had to observe āśauca for one day (Dharmasindhu p. 427), but if a woman was delivered of a child at her husband's house then her father or brother had to observe no āśauca (on birth). Even when _sagotras_ have to observe āśauca on birth they are not untouchable (Ṣadaśīti verse 6).

### General rules about āśauca
It would be better to state here certain general rules once for all. When any text employs the word day (_ahaḥ_) or night (_rātri_) in prescribing the duration of āśauca what is meant is _ahorātra_ (both day[^622] and night). When counting the days of aśauca one has to begin from the day of the cremation, if the deceased was an _āhitāgni_, but from the day of death in the case of one not an _āhitāgni_[^623] ( Āśauca-daśaka verse 4, Kūrma, Uttarārdha 23.52). 

[^619]: यथाह संवर्तः। जाते पुत्रे पितुः स्नानं सचैलं तु विधीयते । माता शुध्येद्दशाहेन स्नानात्तु स्पर्शनं पितुः। माता शुध्येद्दशाहेनेत्येतच्च संव्यवहारयोग्यतामात्रम् । अदृष्टार्थेषु पुनः कर्मसु पैठीनसिना विशेष उक्तः। सूतिकां पुत्रवतीं विंशतिरात्रेण कर्माणि कारयेत् । मासेन स्त्रीजननीम् । इति। मिता. on या. III. 19.

[^620]: सूतिका सर्ववर्णानां दशाहेन विशुध्यति। ऋतौ तु न पृथक शौचं सर्ववर्णेष्वयं विधिः। प्रचेतस् q.by हारलता P. 20, शद्धिचन्द्रिका on verse 6. स्मृतिच, (आशौचकाण्ड) P.5 quotes it but explains it differently.

[^621]: नाशौचं प्रसवस्यास्ति व्यतीतेषु दिनेष्वपि। देवल. q. by कुल्लूक on मनु V. 76; रघुनाथ in his com, on त्रिंशच्छ्लोकी verse 6 p. 27 reads 'नाशुद्धिः प्रसवाशौचे व्यतीतेषु दिनेष्वपि'.

[^622]: अत्राशौचप्रकरणे अहर्ग्रहणं रात्रिग्रहणं चाहोरात्रोपलक्षणार्थम् । मिता. on या. III. 18.

Birth and death are causes of āśauca only when they are known to the person who is to be affected by it and not by the mere fact of the birth or death.

This follows from certain passages of Pāraskara gr. III. 10 and Manu V. 75-76 and the Brahmapurāṇa. Pāraskara (III. 10) provides :[^624] 

> 'if one who had gone abroad dies,  
> (his relatives) should on hearing (of his death) sit down and offer him water and should remain untouchable for the days that remain out of the proper period (viz. 10, 12, 15, 30 days);  
> if the prescribed period of aśauca ) has expired they should observe āśauca for one night or three nights,'

Manu (V.75-76) is to the same effect. The Brahmapurāṇa states: 

> 'if a donor makes a gift and the acceptor accepts it when both are not aware of there being a birth or death in their family, no blame attaches.'


### Rules about āśauca on death
We should now turn to āśauca on death. Here again there is no unanimity and therefore the views preferably of the latest works (such as the Dharmasindhu) will be set out after referring to a few smṛti passages. Āśauca on death renders those who incur it untouchable and unable to perform religious rites. Pār. gr. III, 10. 29-30 (S. B. E. vol. 29 p. 357) stated generally that the impurity caused by death lasts through three nights and that according to some teachers through ten nights. 

- If a child dies within ten days of birth, the father and mother have to observe _Jananāśauca_ and become purified by the end of the āśauca on birth and the father remains untouchable for those days (Kūrma-purāṇa q. by S. K, p. 21). 
- If a child died before it struck teeth the _sapiṇḍas_ had only to undergo a bath, while the parents had to observe āśauca for three days if the child was a son and for one day if a daughter (vide Yāj. III. 23, Sankha 15. 4, Atri 95, Āśaucadaśaka verse 2). 
- If the child died after striking teeth but before Cūdā (or the end of the third year) the sapiṇḍas had to observe āśauca for one day and night (Yaj. III. 23, Sankha 15, 5), but the parents had āśauca (of death) for three days. If the child was a girl the sapiṇḍas became pure by a bath up to the girl's third year. 
- If death occurs between Cūdā (or three years) and _upanayana_ or marriage (in the case of girls) the sapiṇḍas including the father have to observe āśauca for three days and samānodakas become purified by a bath alone. 
- After upanayana all sapiṇḍas have to observe āśauca (on death ) for ten days (Gaut. 14, 1, Manu V. 59, Aśaucadaśaka 2) and all samānodakas for three days.

[^624]: प्रोषितश्चेतप्रेयात् <u> श्रवणप्रभृति </u> कृतोदकाः कालशेषमासीरत्नतीतश्चेदेकरात्रं त्रिरात्रं चा । पारस्करगृह्य III, 10.

- In the case of a śūdra dying after three and before marriage or 16 years the āśauca is three days for all sapiṇḍas. 
- After sixteen years or marriage (in the case of a śūdra) it is the āśauca prescribed for his caste. 

- In the case of a girl dying after three years and before _vāgdāna_ (betrothal) the parents have āśauca for three days and the sapipdas (up to three generations ) one day. 
- If a girl dies after vāgdāna and before marriage the sapiṇḍas of her father as well as of the proposed bridegroom had to observe āśauca for three days.
- In the case of women and śūdras if death takes place after marriage or after 16 years (if the Sūdra was unmarried) the period of āśauca for all sapiṇḍas is ten days. 
- If a woman dies at her father's house after marriage, her parents, step-mother, full brothers and step-brothers have to obserye āśauca for three days and her paternal uncle and the like that stay in the same house with her father for one day. 
- Some say that if the married daughter dies in a village other than that of the father, the parents have to observe āśauca for a _pakṣiṇī_ [^625] (i.e. two nights with a day between or two days with a night between). There are other views on this point which are passed over. For example, Viṣṇu-dharmasūtra (22. 32-34) says that in the case of a married woman there is no āśauca on the parents' side; but when she is delivered of a child or dies in the father's house then the impurity is for one day or three days respectively[^626]. 
- A married woman has to observe āśauca for three days for the death of her parents or step-mother if ten days have not elapsed from the day of death or for the remaining days out of the period of ten (Yaj. III, 21 latter half). 
- If the married daughter hears of the death of the parents or step-mother at a time more than ten days after the death or within one year she has to observe āśauca for a pakṣiṇī. 
- If a brother whose upanayana has been performed dies at his married sister's house or _vice versa_, āśauca has to be observed for three days by them, but if they do not die at each other's house but in a different one then the āśauca is for a pakṣiṇī and if the death occurs in another village then there is āśauca only for one day.

[^625]: Gaut, Dh. S. 14.17 (श्रुत्वा चोर्ध्वे दशम्याः पक्षिणीम् ), Manu. IV. 97 and V. 81 employ the word पक्षिणी. हरदत्त explains 'अहर्द्वयमध्यगता रात्रिः पक्षिणी रात्रिर्द्वयमध्यगतमहर्वा '. The अमरकोश gives only the first meaning 'आगामिवर्तमानाहर्युक्तायां निशि पक्षिणी'. The शद्धिप्रकाश p. 36 remarks 'द्वावह्नावेकरात्रिश्च पक्षिणीत्यभिधीयते इति भदृनारायणधृतवचनात् । पक्षतुल्यौ दिवसौ पार्श्वयोः स्त इति पक्षिणी रात्रिरिति '।

[^626]: स्त्रीणां विवाह संस्कारः। संस्कृतासु स्त्रीषु नाशौचं भवति पितृपक्षे। ततप्रसवमरणे चेत्पितृगृहे स्यातां तदैकरात्रं त्रिरात्रं च। विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 22. 32-34.


- The same rules apply to step-brothers and step-sisters and also among sisters. 
- A married woman on the death of her paternal grand-father or paternal uncle has to undergo only a bath.
- If a maternal uncle dies, the nephew and the niece have to observe aśauca for a pakṣiṇī. 
- If the maternal uncle dies in the house of the nephew then there is āśauca for three days and for only one day if the maternal uncle had not his upanayana performed or died in another village; the same rules apply to one's mother's step-brother. 
- If the wife of a maternal uncle dies, the nephew or the niece of the maternal uncle have to undergo āśauca for a pakṣiṇī.
- If a nephew whose thread ceremony has been performed dies, his maternal uncle and maternal aunt have āśauca for three days. 
- The same rules apply if the deceased be the son of a step-sister of the maternal uncle. 
- If the niece (sister's daughter) dies there is only a bath for the maternal uncle. 
- If a maternal grandfather dies, the grandchild (the son or daughter of a daughter) has to observe āśauca for three days, but only for a pakṣiṇī if the maternal grandfather dies in a different village. 
- On the death of the maternal grandmother the grandchildren have to observe aśauca for a pakṣiṇī, Some works do not prescribe āśauca for a female descendant such as a niece or grand-daughter. 
- If a daughter's son, whose _upanayana_ had been performed, died, the maternal grandfather and grandmother had to observe āśauca for three days and for pakṣiṇī if the daughter's son had not upanayana performed for him. 
- On the death of a daughter's daughter the maternal grandfather and mother incur no āśauca. 

In all these matters the general rule is that a male whose upanayana had been performed and a married woman alone are liable to undergo aśauca for any relative other than the parents (i. e, on the death of a parent a male though without upanayana and a woman though unmarried are liable to undergo āśauca).

- If a man's father-in-law or mother-in-law die near (in the house of) the man, he has to undergo āśauca for three days, but only for pakṣiṇī if the death is elsewhere than with the son-in law.
- On the death of a son-in-law, the father-in-law and the mother-in-law have to observe āśauca for one day or they have only to take a bath, but if the son-in-law dies in the house of the father-in-law then the āśauca is for three days. 
- On the death of one's wife's brother, the āśauca is for one day if upanayana had been performed; but if no upanayana was performed or if he died in another village a mere bath is enough.
- On the death of one's mother's sisters (full or half) the person (whether man or woman) has to undergo āśauca for a pakṣiṇī; the same rule applies on the death of the father's sister. 
- If it is a step-sister of the father then a mere bath is enough. The father's sister has to undergo a bath if the nephew dies. If one's father's sister or mother's sister dies in one's house then the āśauca is for three days.

- In the case of _bandhus_ (described by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 135 as bhinnagotra sapiṇḍas) of[^627] the three kinds, the āśauca is for a pakṣiṇī, provided the bandhu is _upanīta_ but if he died before upanayana then āśauca is for one day and if the bandhu died in one's house then for three days. 
- If the daughter of the father's sister (and of the other bandhus enumerated in the three verses) dies married, the āśauca is one day, but if they die unmarried only a bath is necessary. 
- Among the three kinds of bandhus, a man himself and his three _ātmabandhus_ have to observe āśauca for each other's death; but the case is different as to _pitṛbandhus_ and _mātṛbandhus_. 
- If any one of these latter dies, there is āśauca for the man whose bandhus they are, but if a man dies, his pitṛbandhus and mātṛbandhus have to observe no āśauca.


- If an adopted son dies, his natural father and adoptive father have to observe āśauca for three days (the Vyavahāramayūkha differs from this ) and the sapiṇḍas for one day.
- If the adoptive or natural father dies, the adopted son has to observe āśauca for three days and for one day for the sapiṇḍas of any one of them. 
- On the death of the son and the grandson of an adopted son, the sapiṇḍas of the natural father and the adoptive father have to observe āśauca for one day and _vice versa_. 

These rules apply if the son adopted is not a sapiṇḍa or samānodaka of the adopter, when he was in his family of birth. But if a sagotra sapiṇḍa or a samānodaka be adopted, then the āśauca is for ten or three days respectively.

[^627]: The bandhus are of three kinds, आत्मबन्धु, पितृबन्धु and मातृबन्धु, In three verses variously attributed to Baudhāyana or Śatātapa three illustrations of each of the three kinds of bandhus are given. आत्मपितृष्वसुः पुत्रा आत्ममातृष्वसुः सुताः। आत्ममातुलपुत्राश्च विज्ञेयां आत्मबान्धवाः ॥ पितुः पितृष्वसुः पुत्राः पितुर्मातृष्वसुः सुताः । पितृर्मातुलपुत्राश्च विज्ञेयाः पितृवान्धवाः। मातुः पितृष्वसुः पुत्रौ मातुर्मातुष्वसुः सुताः । मातुर्मातुलपुत्राश्च विज्ञेयाः मातृवान्धवाः॥ q. by the मिता. on या. II. 135, व्यव.नि. p. 455, परा. मा. III. p. 528, मद. पा. p. 674. For further details, vide H. of Dh, vol. III. pp. 754-762.

- If one's _ācārya_[^628] dies, the pupil has to observe āśauca for three days, but only one day if he dies in another village (Gautama 14, 26, 52, Manu V. 80).
- On the death of the _ācārya's_ wife or son the āśauca is for one day[^629]. 
- On the death of a _guru_ (who instructs in Vedic mantras) the āśauca is three days and pakṣiṇī if he dies in another village. 
- On the death of a teacher who imparted instruction in grammar, astronomy and other _aṅgas_ (subsidiary lores) of the Veda, the āśauca is one day.
- Similar rules are laid down about the death of a pupil, _ṛtvik_ (sacrificial priest), a sacrificer, a dependent śrotriya, a fellow-student, a friend, which are all passed over as not now useful. Vide Gaut, 14. 19-20 (which prescribe one day's āśauca on the death of a fellow-student or a dependent śrotriya).

These provisions about āśauca on the death of the ācārya and r̥tvik who were not sapiṇḍas show how closely the bond between teacher and pupil was thought to be in ancient times, almost equalling the tie of blood. 

- When a _yati_ (ascetic) dies,[^630] all his sapiṇḍas have simply to undergo a bath (and nothing more). 
- Conversely, a yati and brahmacārin have to observe no āśauca. Manu V. 82, Yāj. III. 25, Viṣṇu 22.45. 
- Sankha 15.15 provide that on the death of the ruler of the country in which one resides one has to observe āśauca up till the coming of the day or night next to that on which the king dies[^631].

[^628]: An ācārya is defined by Manu II. 140 as one who performs the upanayapa of his pupil and teaches him the Veda together with the Kalpasūtra and Upaniṣads. Ṛtvik is defined by Manu II. 143 as one who is chosen for the performance of Agnyādheya, the _pākayajñas_ and the solemn sacrifices like Agniṣṭoma.

[^629]: आचार्यपत्नीपुत्रोपाध्यायमातुलश्वशुरश्वशुर्यसहाध्यायिशिष्येष्वतीतेष्वेकरात्रेण । विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 22. 44. श्वशुर्य means wife's brother, Manu (V. 80-81 ) prescribes three days' āśauca on the death of the ācārya, his wife and son, and śrotriya. Gaut. 14.26 does the same.

[^630]: वानप्रस्थे यतौ चोपरमति कुलजे षण्ढके चाफ्लवः स्यात् । त्रिंशच्छ्लोकी 5th verse, 3rd पाद. Vide मनु V. 91 ( = Viṣṇu 22,86) about a ब्रह्मचारिन् carrying the corpse of his parents.

[^631]: प्रेते राजनि सज्योतिर्यस्य स्याद्विषये स्थितः। मनु V. 82. सज्योतिः is explained by the मिता० as 'ज्योतिषा सह वर्तते इति सज्योतिराशौचम् । आह्नि चेद्यावत्सूर्यदर्शनं रात्रौ चेद्यावन्नक्षत्रदर्शनमित्यर्थः।'. या. III. 25 (निवासराजनि प्रेते तदहः शुद्धिकारणम्) is explained by the Mit. in the same sense as मनु V. 82, but the शुद्धिप्र. p. 36 holds that the āśauca for king's death is for a whole day and night provided he is a good king protecting his subjects.

- As long as a corpse is not removed from the village in which a man dies, the whole village is in āśauca. Ā.p. Dh. S. 1. 3. 9. 14 declares that there is no Veda study till a corpse lies in the village. 
- The Smṛti-muktāphala (p. 541) quotes[^632] several smṛtis to the effect that in a village in which a corpse lies unremoved, there is to be no eating, no Vedic study and no sacrifice, but that this does not apply where in a village there are more than four hundred brāhmaṇas. The Dharmasindhu (p. 433) also says the same about a village, but adds that this rule does not apply to a town.

- The ideas of ritualistic purity went so far as to provide (as stated in the Śuddhitattva quoted by the Nirṇayasindhu) that if a dog died in a brāhmaṇa's house the house became impure for ten days, that, if a śūdra[^633], a _patita_ or a _mleccha_ died in a brāhmaṇa's house, the house became impure for a month, two months or four months respectively and the house had to be abandoned if a _śvapāka_ died therein.+++(5)+++

### Atikrāntāśauca

_Atikrāntāśauca_ (impurity on coming to know of birth or death after the several periods fixed). The general rule[^634] is that, if a person stays in a different country and hears of a birth or death among his sapiṇḍas, he has to observe āśauca not for ten days after hearing but for that number of days that are short of the ten days (counting from birth or death) prescribed for sapiṇḍas. Vide Manu V. 75, Yāj. III. 21 (latter half), Śaṅkha 15.11, Pār. gr. III. 10. Āśauca interferes very much with one's activities and it is hence that often-times people send a closed letter to their relatives living in a different place stating thereon that it be opened on a particular day (which is the 10th day from the death of a sapiṇḍa). Every one knows the meaning of such a direction and by such a subterfuge inconvenience is avoided and the dictates of the śāstra are deemed to be satisfied. If a son hears of the death of a parent he has to observe āśauca for ten days from the day of hearing, but if he hears of the death of a parent before the collection of bones then he has to observe āśauca only for the days that remain (Smṛti-muktāphala p. 534). There is great divergence about the period of āśauca if the death of a sapiṇḍa comes to one's ears more than ten days after the day of death. Manu V.77 provides that on hearing of the death of a sapiṇḍa or the birth of a son after ten days from the event) a man becomes pure after plunging into water with the clothes on and Yāj. III. 21 (last pāda, 'pūrne dattvodakam śuciḥ') states that he becomes pure after a bath and) offering water when the period fixed has passed off. From the words of Manu that only the father, even if he hears of the birth of a son more than ten days after the event, has to take a bath the Mit. infers that there is no atikrāntāśauca for sapiṇḍas on birth[^635]. The Mit. quotes Devala in support (vide note 621 above). The Dharmasindhu follows the Mit. Manu V. 76, Śaṅkha 15.12, Kūrmapurāṇa (Uttarārdha) 23,21 state that when ten days have passed after the event of death, the man who hears of the death is impure for three days and if he hears of the death more than a year after death, he becomes pure after a bath. In order to remove the conflict among smṛtis Vṛddha-Vasiṣṭha lays down: 'āśauca is for three days if the news of death is heard within three months (but later than ten days after death), for a pakṣiṇī if it is heard within six months (but later than three months), for one day if heard before nine months (but later than 6 months ) and thereafter (i.e, up to one year but later than nine months ) one becomes pure by a bath. But the Mit, says[^636] that this holds good as to all except one's parents and quotes Paiṭhinasi and another smṛti for the proposition that whenever a son staying in a distant country hears of the death of a parent whether within a year or after a year he has to observe āśauca for ten days from the day he becomes aware of it. Laghu-Āśvalāyana (20.88) lays down the same exception in the case of a son. The Mit. (on Yāi. III. 21 last half) further says that the rules about _atikrāntāśauca_ apply only to a deceased person whose upanayana had been performed. The Dharmasindhu (p. 433 ) remarks that there is no atikrāntāśauca as regards the periods of one day and three days prescribed on the death of one whose upanayana had not been performed or as regards the periods of pakṣiṇī and three days on the death of the maternal uncle and others of a different gotra. Similarly, there is no atikrāntāśauca with reference to the āśauca for three days prescribed in the case of samānodakas; but in these cases even after the lapse of the fixed time a bath is necessary. The rules about _atikrāntāśauca_ apply only to āśauca on death for ten days. As in the case of the son, so in the cases of husband and wife and of co-wives among themselves even after the lapse of more than a year and even if the death is in a different country the husband or wife or co-wife has to observe āśauca for ten days. The parents, even when they hear of the death of an _aurasa_ son after a year, have to observe āśauca for three days. On the news of the death of a sapiṇḍa living in the same country coming to a sapiṇḍa's ears after ten days but up to three months, the period of aśauca is three days, pakṣipi up to 6 months, up to nine months one day and up to one year a bath. Here also there are various views such as those of Mādhava and others. Vide Śuddhiprakāśa pp. 49-51 for various views.

### Aśauca if death in another country

The Mit on Yāj. III. 21 (latter half ) makes a distinction between knowledge of the death of a sapiṇḍa staying in the
same country coming to a person's ears after ten days from death and of the death of a sapiṇḍa staying in another country sepa rated by a big river &c. In the latter case the sapiṇḍas coming to hear of the death after ten days but even before three months are purified by a mere bath. It quotes[^637] a smṛti verse 'on hearing that a person (sapiṇḍa) died in another country and in the case of the death of an impotent person or a forest hermit or an ascetic purification follows after a bath and the same applies to _sagotra_ sapiṇḍas in the case of abortion,' The Ṣaḍaśīti (35) has a similar verse[^638]. The Mit. quotes two verses of Bṛhaspati which define what _deśāntara_ (a different country ). means:[^639] Where there is a large river or there is a mountain which separates (one territory from another ) or where the languages differ then there is _deśāntara_. Some say that a different country means the distance of sixty _yojanas_, while others put it down at forty _yojanas_ and still others at thirty _yojanas_.' There is a difference of opinion as to whether in order to constitute a different country all three must co-exist (viz, a large river, a mountain and difference of speech) or any one of the three will suffice or whether 60, 40 or 30 yojanas would constitute a different country or whether the requirement of ten days for news to be carried to a place would constitute _deśāntara_. The Sm. C. and Ṣadaśiti 37 hold the view that any one of the above three is sufficient while others hold other views. The Śuddhiviveka[^640] holds that a distance of 60 yojanas constituted deśāntara by itself, but even within sixty yojanas if a large river, a mountain and difference of speech occurred together, that could give rise to deśāntara.

The Smṛtyarthasāra[^641] avers that deśāntara is differently described in the Smṛtis, Purāṇas and the works on tirthas. For yojana, vide H. of Dh. vol. III n. 185 pp. 145-146.

The Dharmasindhu (p. 435) provides that if the bones of an _āhitāgni_ were not found and only an effigy of palāśa leaves were burnt, still the āśauca is for ten days even if he died in a different country and a long time had elapsed. Similarly, in the case of the effigy of one who is not an āhitāgni, the āśauca is for ten days for his son and wife if they have not already observed any āśauca for him but if they had observed it (on hearing of his death ) then for three days (on the burning of the effigy ). For other sapiṇḍas (than the son and wife ) in the same circumstances three days and bath are respectively prescribed.

It is provided in the Gṛhya kārikas, the Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 94), Dharmasindhu (p. 435) and other works that if a man[^642] went to a distant country and no news of his being alive was heard, then his son or other relative), after the lapse of 20 years from the time when no news was heard if the man went away when he was young or 15 years if he left when he was of middle age or 12 years if he left later in life, should perform three cāndrāyaṇas or thirty kṛcchras, prepare an effigy of the man with kuśas (or with palāśa leaves ), should burn it and then observe āśauca and perform śrāddhas &c.

### Summary of rules on āśauca

To summarize the above discussion it is clear that as indicated by Medhātithi on Manu V. 58 there is a distinction as regards the periods of aśauca and the persons affected by it in several ways. 

1) There is a distinction between āśauca on birth and āśauca on death; 
2) As to aśauca on death numerous distinctions arise viz. 
   a) when there is abortion (garbhasrāva or garbhapāta, as in Sankha 15. 4, Bṛhat-Parāśara VI. p. 186 );   
   b) when the foetus comes out from the 7th to the 9th month of pregnancy or the child is still-born or dies after being born but before the appearance of teeth (Yāj. III. 23, Atri 95);  
   c) after the appearance of teeth but before cūḍā or three years (Viṣṇu 22. 29, Yāj. III. 23);  
   d) after cūḍā or three years up to upanayana (Manu V. 67); (e) after upanayana (Yaj. III, 23, Manu V. 59, Gaut. 14. 1);  
   f) as to āśauca on death after upanayana the duration at one time depended in the case of brāhmaṇas on Vedic study, the performance of _śrauta_ rites and whether the brāhmaṇa subsisted on ears of corn left in the field after the crops were harvested[^643] (Parāśara TII, 5, Sankha 15.1, Atri 83, Agnipurāṇa 158. 10-11);  
   g) the duration of āśauca depended on caste (Gaut. 14. 1-4, Yāj. III. 22 &c. );  
   h) the duration of āśauca depended on nearness of blood i.e. whether the person affected was a sapiṇḍa or a samānodaka (Gaut. 14. 1 and 18, Manu V. 59, 64);  
   i) the duration depended also on the nearness or distance from the place of death (Laghu-Āśvalāyana 20. 85, 89);  
   j) it also depended on whether the deceased died in a different country separated by a large river, a mountain or thirty yojanas (Laghu-Āśvalāyana 20.87);  
   k) duration depended on the time that elapsed before it came to the knowledge of the relative;  
   l) the duration depended upon whether another āśauca supervened when the period of the first was not over.

If a person is born or died at night or news thereof is received at night, a question arises as to from what day the periods of āśauca are to be calculated. For example, if a man died at 1 A. M. on Monday, was Monday to be included in counting ten days of āśauca or was it to be excluded ? There are two views on this point[^643a]. One view is that any time before midnight is to be counted as belonging to the previous day, while any time after midnight is to be taken as belonging to the next day. On this view in the above illustration Monday would be excluded in the calculation of ten days. The other view is that the night is to be divided into three parts and if death occurs in the first two of the three parts then the day is to be included in the calculation; if the time of death falls in the 3rd part, the ten days are to be calculated from the next day. On this view Monday would be included in the ten days. The Dharmasindhu (p. 435 ) remarks that in this matter the usage of the country is to be followed. Vide Madanapārijāta pp. 394-395 also.

#### Inter-caste cases
Several rules are mentioned in the smṛtis about the periods of āśauca for the relatives of higher castes when they marry women of lower varṇas (i.e. when there are anuloma marriages). For example, Dakṣa VI. 12 says that if a brāhmaṇa has married wives of the four varṇas, then the impurity on the delivery or death of these women respectively lasts for 10, 6, 3 or 1 day. Viṣṇu Dh. S. (22. 22-24) provides that when a kśatriya has sapiṇḍas of the vaiśya or śūdra varṇa the āśauca on the birth and death of these lasts for six or three days, if a vaiśya has a śūdra as sapiṇḍa then impurity is removed after six days. But when people of lower varṇas have sapiṇḍas of higher varṇas then impurity on birth and death ceases when the impurity of the higher varṇa sapiṇḍas ceases. Laghu-Hārīta 84 (= Āpastambasmṛti IX verse 13) has similar provisions. Other smṛtis and purāṇas like the Kūrma (Uttarārdha 23. 30-36) mention differing views quoted in Hāralata pp. 54-60, Smr. M. pp. 495-496. The Madanapārijāta remarks (pp. 425-426 ) that some say that these varying provisions may be discarded or that they may be assigned their proper place according to the usages of the several countries or they should somehow be explained as based upon the person affected being possessed of virtues or not or they may be held to be appli cable to seasons of distress or otherwise.

According to the Mit. on Yáj.[^644] III, 22 persons belonging to the _pratiloma_ castes have no periods of aśauca, but they have to observe rules of purification similar to those relating to answering the call of nature. Others like the Smṛti-muktaphala[^645] p. 495 aver, relying on Manu (X. 41), that the _pratiloma_ castes are like sūdras and have to observe the āśauca prescribed for śūdras. The Hāralatā (p. 12 ) quotes Adipurāṇa to the effect that varṇasaṅkaras (i.e. pratilomas) should follow the sūdras in the matter of aśauca and purification. The Smṛtyartha-sāra (p. 92) states that those born of pratiloma unions should observe āśauca if they perform prāyaścitta, but if they do not perform prāyaścitta then there is no āśauca for them.

[^644]: प्रतिलोमानां त्वाशौचाभाव एव प्रतिलोमा धर्महीनाः-इति मनुस्मरणात्। केवलं मृतौ प्रसवे च मलापकर्षणार्थे मूत्रपुरीषोत्सर्गवत् शौचं भवत्येव । मिता. on या. III 22. प्रतिलोमास्तु धर्महीनाः is गौ. 4. 20.

[^645]: सङ्करजातीनां शूद्रेष्वन्तर्भावात्तेषां शूद्रवदाशौचम् । स्मृतिमु. (आशौच) p. 495

#### Corpse carrying
It has already been stated (p. 215) how it was the duty of sapiṇḍas to take out the corpse and to cremate it and how carrying the dead body of a poor brāhmaṇa was highly eulogised (Parāśara III. 39-40). But, as Manu V. 101-102 provide, if a brāhmaṇa carried through affection the dead body of one[^646] who was not his sapiṇḍa, as if he were a bandhu or carried (the dead body) of his mother's bandhus (such as mother's brother or sister) he became pure after three days; but if he partook of the food of those who were bereaved by death he became pure after ten days and if he does not stay in the house of those bereaved nor partakes of their food he becomes pure in a day (but if he stays in their house though not partaking of their food he has to observe aśauca for three days). Vide Kurmapurāṇa (Uttarardha 23.37) and Viṣṇu 22. 7-9 also. Gautama (14.21-25) has rules on the same subject but they somewhat differ and Haradatta remarks that this āśauca is somewhat different from the āśauca observed by sapiṇḍas, viz. he becomes untouchable but he need not follow the other rules such as sleeping on the ground &c. 

If a person carried a dead body through greed (for money ), a brāhmaṇa, kśatriya, vaiśya or śūdra had to observe āśauca respectively for 10, 12, or 15 days or a month. This was called nirhārāśauca, the word ‘nirhāra'[^647] including the covering of the dead body with a garment, decking it with garlands, perfumes and ornaments, carrying it and cremating it. Sapiṇḍas who are observing āśauca for the death of the same person may dine in the same house and partake of the food cooked, but not others who are not undergoing the same āśauca[^648].

III. 17. कल्पतरु (on आशौच) p. 23 and अपरार्क ascribe (p.892) the verse उभयत्र to मनु, Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 17.

#### Procession
Gaut. 14. 29, Manu V. 103, Yāj. III. 26, Parāśara III. 42 prescribe that a brāhmaṇa should not follow the funeral procession of a deceased brāhmaṇa, but if he does so, he has to bathe, touch fire, take in ghee and then he becomes pure. Parāśara III, 43-46 and Kūrmapurāpa (Uttarārdha 23.45) provide a rising scale of the days of āśauca if a brāhmaṇa follows the corpse of a kśatriya (āśauca for one day and pañcagavya), a vaiśya (āśauca for two days and six prāṇāyāmas), a śūdra (āśauca for three days, bath in a river going to the sea, 100 prāṇāyāmas[^649] and drinking of ghee). Vide Trimśac-chloki Verse 13.

#### Weeping and consolation
If a brāhmaṇa who is not a sapiṇḍa of the deceased went to the bereaved family and wept along with the relatives before the collection of bones he had to observe āśauca for a day and then a bath if the deceased was a kśatriya or vaiśya, but aśauca for three days if the deceased was a śūdra; but he had to undergo only a bath if he went after the collection of the bones; when the deceased was a śūdra and the weeping took place after the collection of bones he had to observe āśauca for a whole day and night. Vide Kūrmapurāṇa (Uttarārdha 23.46-47). Agnipurāṇa 158.47-48, Par, M. 1.2. pp. 283-285, Smr. M. (āśauca) p. 543 and Aśāucadaśaka verse 9 (for _nirhāra_, following a funeral procession and weeping ).

#### āśauca cause separation
Persons[^650] undergoing an āśauca on birth or death for one person were forbidden to touch other persons undergoing aśauca for the birth or death of another person altogether. If they did so they had to perform prāyaścitta (Prājāpatya or Sāntapana).

#### Illicit relationship
Even if a person's wife left him and lived in illicit relationship with a person of the same or higher caste he had to observe on her death āśauca for one day. But if she lived with one lower in varṇa than her husband, the latter had not, on her death, to observe any āśauca at all (Yāj. III,6 ). Similarly, one had to observe one day's āśauca on the death of sons that were not _aurasa_ (such as kṣetraja). Vide Yāj. III.25 and Viṣṇu 22.42-43.

[^649]: एकाहात्क्षत्रिये शुद्धिर्वैश्ये च स्याद् द्वयहेन तु । शूद्रे दिनत्रयं प्रोक्तं प्राणायामशतं पुनः ॥ कूर्मपुराण (उत्तरार्ध 23.45) q, in शुद्धितत्त्व p. 293, शुद्धिप्र. p. 63.

[^650]: आशौचिनामन्योन्यसंस्पर्श निषेधति भृगुः। शावाशौचे समुत्पन्ने सूतके च द्विजातिभिः। अन्याशौचवतां स्पर्शो न कर्तव्यो द्विजन्मनाम् ॥ आशौचेप्यन्यदाशौचं स्पृशेद्यदिच कामतः। चरेत् सान्तपनं कृच्छ्रे प्राजापत्यमकामतः॥ स्मृतिमु. (आशौच) p. 502.

### Exceptions to Āśauca

Certain exceptions were recognized to the above rules about partaking of food at the house of one who is afflicted with āśauca. 

While a marriage[^651] rite (as also _caula_ and _upanayana_ ), festival in honour of a deity and a sacrifice (like Jyotiṣṭoma ) are in progress, if impurity due to birth or death overtakes the performer, the materials (money and other things ) already set apart for them may be dedicated or donated to the deity or brāhmaṇas and no fault is incurred. 

As regards food, a smṛti text[^652] quoted by the Mit. says 'if in marriage, in a festival in honour of a deity or in a sacrifice āśauca on birth or death intervenes, the cooked food should be served through others (not affected by the āśauca) and the donor and the partaker of the food incur no blame. 

Acc. to Aṅgiras[^653], Paiṭhinasi (q. by Sm. C.) and Viṣṇu Dh. S., when once a sacrifice (like a Somayāga), a marriage, a sacrifice or festival in honour of the mother Goddesses or a deity or the dedication or foundation of an idol or temple has been begun a supervening āśauca does not matter. 

Even in modern times this is followed as regards upanayana and marriage. When exactly a sacrifice or marriage ceremony may be said to have begun is laid down by Laghu-Viṣṇu as follows:[^654] 

- in the case of a sacrifice it may be said to begin when the priests are chosen, 
- in the case of vratas and _japa_ when the saṅkalpa (declaration) is made, 
- in the case of marriage when the Nândiśrāddha is performed, 
- and in the case of a śrāddha when the food meant for the brāhmaṇas has been cooked completely. 
  
Certain things could be taken from the house of one who was undergoing āśauca[^655] on birth or death and who was the owner thereof (though not actually from his hand, but with his permission). The Kūrmapurāṇa enumerates such articles. They are "fruits, flowers, raw vegetables, salt, firewood, butter-milk, curds, ghee, oil, drugs, milk and dry food" (like _laddus_, lājas ). 

Marīci (q. by Mit. on Yaj. III. 17) and Trimśac-chloki verse 20 present oven longer lists of such things.

[^651]: विवाहोत्सवयज्ञेषु त्वन्तरा मृतसूतके। पूर्वसङ्कल्पितं द्रव्यं दीयमानं न दुष्यति ॥ पराशर III. 27. The latter half is also ascribed to ऋतु by the मिता. on या.. III. 29.

Some smṛtis and commentators lay down rules about the aśauca to be observed by slaves when their masters are in āśauca. Vide Viṣṇu Dh. S. 22.19, Devalasmṛti verse 6, Bṛhaspati quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 14.4. But as slavery has long been abolished this topic is passed over here.

### Āśaucasannipāta
__ or _āśaucasampāta_ (the knowledge of another āśauca coming to a person already observing one āśauca)[^656]. The rules about this matter were promulgated early enough and they are based on convenience and common sense. The rules try to give relief to persons who may be sorely tried if it were held that, when another āśauca supervenes while a person is already in the midst of one, he has to finish all the days of the first āśauca and then begin the period of the second āśauca. The Gaut. Dh..S. 14.5 starts by saying that if another āśauca supervenes on one already being undergone, purification results after the remaining days of the first āśauca are over. Then sūtras 6 and 7 provide that if the second aśauca supervenes in the last night of the first āśauca then purification results in two days after the first āśauca ends and if the second āśauca comes to be known in the last watch of the night of the last day of the first āśauca, the second ends in three days after the first ends. Baud. Dh. S. I. 5, 123 appears to be similar to Gaut. 14.5-6 Manu V. 79, Yāj. III. 20, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 22. 35-38, Śaṅkha 15. 10, Parāśara III. 28 lay down the general rule promulgated by Gautama 14.5.

#### Rules on āśaucasannipāta

Some general rules concerning this topic may first be stated. The first rule is that in a conflict between āśauca on death and āśauca on birth, that on death is stronger[^657]. The 2nd rule is that if both āśaucas are of the same kind and the second is of the same duration or of lesser duration than the first then a man gets rid of both at the end of the first, but if the second, though of the same kind, has a longer duration than the first, then purification follows at the end of the one that is of longer duration. It has to be remembered that birth and death give rise to āśauca[^658] only when they are known by a person.

On this topic there is a good deal of divergence between the views of the followers of the Mitakṣarā, of the Gaudas and Maithilas (vide Śuddhiprakāsa pp. 74-82, Nirṇayasindhu 536-540). Following the Nirṇayasindhu it may be said that twelve alternatives are possible, when another āśauca supervenes on an already existing one. They are set out here. (1 & 2) If both āśaucas are due to birth and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the first āśauca there is purification from both (Visṇu 22.35, Sankha 15.70); (3) If both āśaucas are due to birth and the second one is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Śankha 15.10, Ṣadaśiti 19 ); ( 4 and 5) If both āśaucas arise on death and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the period of the first aśauca there is purification from both; (6) If both āśaucas arise on death and the second that intervenes is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Ṣadaśīti 21); (7, 8 and 9) When the firt āśauca is one arising from birth and an āśauca due to deaths intervenes, the āśauca on death must run its full course (i.e. there is no purification by the lapse of the first āśauca due to birth), whether the āśauca for death is of lesser duration than the āśauca on birth, or whether it is of the same or of longer duration (Ṣadaśiti 18); (10, 11) If the[^659] first āśauca arises on death and the supervening one is due to birth and is of lesser duration than the one on death or of the same duration then both end at the expiration of the first āśauca on death (Ṣadasīti 21); (12) If the first āśauca arises on death and the supervening one arises on birth and is of longer duration, then both run their proper courses (Ṣadaśīti 21).

I. 2 p. 265 reads शङ्ख as समानाशौचसम्पाते प्रेथमेन and explains असमानं as दीर्घकालाशौचम् । The reading समानं खलु शौचं तु printed in शुद्धिकल्प. p. 31 makes no sense.

The Dharmasindhu (p. 436) generally follows the Nirṇayasindhu but remarks: 'Āśauca on death cannot be done away with by āśauca on birth which is of the same or greater duration; āśauca on death of the extent of pakṣiṇī cannot get rid of āśauca on birth which is three or ten days in duration and āśauca on birth extending to ten days cannot be got rid of by āśauca on death which is of three days' duration'. These are the views of many writers. A certain writer says that āśauca on birth though longer in duration can be got rid of by āśauca on death which is of lesser extent.

The Mit. on Yāj. III, 20 (first half) states an exception to the above rules about āśauca-sannipāta. When a person's mother dies and then, while the period of āśauca for the mother's death is not over, the father dies, it does not follow that the āśauca for the father comes to an end with the end of the āśauca for the mother, but the son has to observe the full period of[^660] the āśauca for father's death. Similarly, if the father died first and then, while the period of āśauca for the father was not over, the mother died, it does not follow that the āśauca for the mother's death comes to an end with the end of the first period of āśauca for the father, but the son after observing the period of the father's āśauca has to observe āśauca for the mother for one pakṣiṇī in addition. It may be remarked that Aparārka construes this verse differently by stating that if the father dies during the period of āśauca for the death of the mother, then the general rule applies, viz, that purification follows at the end of the āśauca for the mother.

[^660]: तथा सजातीयान्तःपातित्वेपि शावस्य क्वचित्पूर्वशेषेण शुद्धरभावः स्मृत्यन्तरे दर्शितः । मातर्थग्रे प्रमीतायामशुद्धौ म्रियते पिता । पितुःशेषेण शुद्धिः स्यान्मातुः कुर्यात पक्षिणीम् ॥ मित्ता. on या. III. 20. The verse is ascribed to शङ्ख by अपरार्क P.900, परा. मा. I. 2. p. 267, शद्धिप्रकाश p. 76. Verses 24-25 of the षडशीति contain the same idea; मद, पा. p. 438 ascribes it to अङ्गिरस् .

#### Special rules about āśauca

If, while an āśauca on death is being undergone, an āśauca on birth arises, the father of the child born is able to perform the rites of Jātakarma and the like, because he is to be deemed to be purified for the nonce, according to Prajāpati[^661].

The Ṣadaśiti (verse 22) provides[^662] that the rule about purification on the expiry of the first āśauca in the case of succeeding āśaucas on birth or death has three exceptions, viz, a woman who is delivered of a child, the person who actually cremates the body (of the deceased) and the sons of the deceased; that is, a _sūtikā_ has to observe the proper period of untouchability and one who cremates a dead body has to observe āśauca for ten days, though the delivery or cremation takes place in the midst of an āśauca on death.

### SADYAḤ-ŚAUCA. (purification on the same day) 
It has already been seen (p. 274) that Dakṣa (VI. 2) speaks of ten kinds of impurity on birth or death, the first two of which are _sadyaḥśāuca_ and _ekāha_. Ekāha means day and night together (vide note 622 above). The ordinary meaning of 'sadyaḥ' is 'at once, immediately.' But when Yaj. III. 29, Parāśara III. 10, Atri 97 and other smṛtis employ the word 'sadyaḥ-śauca' what is meant is that there is no āśauca for a whole day or three days or ten days, but only up to the taking of a bath or up to the end of the day or the end of the night on which the event occurs. Panini[^663] mentions 'sadyaḥ' and thirteen other words in one sutra as _nipātas_ (irregularly formed). From Yāj. III. 23 (ādantajanmanaḥ sadya ācūdānnaiśjki smṛtā) it impliedly follows that _sadyaḥ_ has the meaning of a part of a day or a part of the night' (as the case may be) and 'naiśiki' means a whole day and night (as note 622 shows).

[^661]: प्रेतक्रिया पुनः सूतकसंनिपातेऽपि न निवर्तत इति तेनैवोक्तम् (शातातपेन)। तथा शावाशौचयोः सन्निपातेपि प्रेतकृत्यं कार्यम् । तुल्यन्यायत्वात् । तथा जातकर्मादिकमपि पुत्रजन्मानिमित्तकमाशोचान्तरसन्निपातेऽपि कार्यमेव । तथाह प्रजापतिः। आशोचे तु समुत्पन्ने पुत्रजन्म यदा भवेत् । कर्तुस्तात्कालिकी शुद्धिः पूर्वाशौचेन शुध्यति । मिता. on या.

[^662]: पूर्वशेषेण या शुद्धिः सूतिनां मृतिनां तथा। सूतिकामग्निदं हित्वा प्रेतस्य च सुतानपि ॥ षडशीति 22; this is made clear by the verses of देवल and शातातप quoted by शुद्धिचन्द्रिका on षडशीति 'सूतिकानां भवेच्छुद्धिः कालेनैव रजःक्षये । नाशौचान्तरपातेन सूतके मृतकेपि च । सपिण्डानां तु यः कश्चिद्वहेताथ दहेत वा । तस्याशौचं दशाहं तु नान्याशौचेन शुध्यति ॥'

The Śuddhitattva (pp. 340-341 ) explains[^664] 'sadyaḥ' as meaning 'a portion of the day or of the night' and cites several authorities in support. The Śuddhiprakāśa (p. 92) explains that 'sadyaḥśauca' in some contexts means 'absence of āśauca,' while in others it means 'bath' and with reference to those killed in battle and the like (to whom piṇḍas have to be offered) it means a part of the day or of the night.' The Smṛtimuktāphala[^665] (āśaucakāṇḍa ) p.481 says that'sadyaḥśauca' means 'impurity that comes to an end by a bath.' That piṇḍas have to be offered to those about whom there is 'sadyaḥśauca' is stated by the Adipurāṇa[^666]. 

According to the Śuddhikaumudi (p.73) 'sadyaḥśauca' has two meanings, viz. (1) the entire absence of āśauca as in the cases of sacrificial priests &c. (Yāj. III. 28), (2) āśauca that is removed by a mere bath ( as in Manu V. 76).

The rules about āśauca for several days do not operate in five classes of cases, viz. certain persons are exempted altogether, certain activities of certain _persons_ who would ordinarily be untouchable owing to āśauca are allowed without causing pollution, certain _articles_ can be taken by anybody without fear of pollution from those who are affected by āśauca, no āśauca is to be observed _for certain deceased_ persons owing to their faults, in the case of certain persons _express texts_ say that no āśauca need be observed for them. These five classes will briefly be dealt with in order. In the principal texts these five classes of cases are rather mixed up. 

[^664]:  अत्र सद्यःपदमहोरात्रार्धपरम्।...द्वे सन्ध्ये सद्य इत्याहुस्त्रिसन्ध्यैकाहिकः स्मृतः।  द्वावह्नावेकरात्रिश्च पक्षिणीत्यभिधीयते ॥ इति भट्टनारायणवचनात् । द्वे सन्ध्ये सद्य इत्याहु स्त्रिन्ध्यैकाह उच्यते। दिनद्वयैकरात्रिस्तु पक्षिणीत्यभिधीयते इति नव्यवर्धमानधृतवचनाच्च। सद्य एकाहेनाशौचमिति पारिजाते सद्य एकाहेनेति स्मृतिसारे। एकमहः सद्य इति शुद्धिपञ्ज्यां दर्शनाच्चति । तच्चार्धे दिनमात्रं रात्रिमात्रं च। एतदेव क्वचित् सज्योतिःपदेन व्यपदिश्यते। शुद्धितत्व pp. 340-341. शुद्धिप्रकाश p. 93 states that the verse द्वे सन्ध्ये सद्य occurs in the गोभिलभाष्य of नारायणभट्ट.

[^665]: सद्यःशौचं नाम स्नानान्तमघम् । सद्यःशौचे तु तावत्स्यादाशौचं संस्थितस्य तु। यावत्स्नानं न कुर्वन्ति सचैलं वान्धवा बहिः॥ इत्याङ्गिरःस्मरणात् । स्मृतिमु. p. 481.

[^666]: दिवसे दिवसे पिण्डो देय एवं क्रमेण तु । सद्यःशौचेपि दातव्याः सर्वेपि युगपत्तथा । आदिपुराण q. by हारलता p. 165. The latter half is cited as from ब्रह्मपुराण by रघुनाथ on त्रिशच्छोकी verse 28 p. 249. It is not unlikely that the ब्रह्मपुराण which is mentioned in several works as the first of the 18 पुराणs was therefore and called आदिपुराण.

#### Cases of sadyah-śauca

In the Viṣṇupurāṇa III, 13.7 it is provided that there is sadyaḥśauca on the death of a child, or of a person dying in another country, of a patita, or of an ascetic, or on the death of a person committing suicide by water, fire or hanging. Vide also Gaut. 14.11 and 42 and Vāmanapurāṇa 14.99.

Yāj. (III. 28-29 ) prescribes that there is sadyaḥśauca (purification after a bath ) in case of birth or death of a sapiṇda ) for priests chosen for a sacrifice (after they are offered Madhuparka ), for those who have undergone _dīkṣā_ for a vedic sacrifice (like _Somayāga_) and those who are engaged in performing the constituent parts of a Vedic sacrifice, those who continuously distribute food at a charity house, those who are engaged in prāyascittas like cāndrāyaṇa or the vows of _snātakas_, for brahmacārins (when performing the duties of their _āśrama_ ), for persons who everyday make gifts of a cow, gold etc. (at the time of making the gift), for those who have realized Brahman (ascetics); there is sadyaḥśauca at gifts ( when once begun), at marriage, in a Vedic sacrifice, in battle (for those who are about to be engaged in it), when there is commotion in a country (through invasion ), and in a severe calamity (like famine when one can accept food from any body). 

##### Kings
Gaut. (14, 43-44) says that there is sadyaḥśauca in the case of kings as otherwise there will be obstacles in their duties and also in the case of brāhmaṇas in order to prevent the cessation of their duties of teaching. Śaṅkhalikhita says the same - 

> Rajā dharmāyatanam sarveṣām tasmād anavaruddhaḥ pretaprasavadoṣaiḥ  
> (Śuddhikalpataru p. 62). 

It is stated in Manu V. 93 that kings[^667] those engaged in _vratas_ and _sattras_ (like _Gavām-ayana_ ) are not liable to undergo the blemish of āśauca, because they (kings ) occupy the position of Indra (ruler) and are like Brahma (which is free from all taint) and Manu V. 94 clinches the matter further by observing 'sadyaḥśauca is ordained for the position of a king which can be obtained only by great merit (in past lives) for the sake of the protection of the subjects and the reason of this (rule) is the position that he occupies.'

[^667]: न राज्ञामघदोषोस्ति व्रतिनां न च सत्रिणाम् । ऐन्द्रं स्थानमुपासीना ब्रह्मभूता हि ते सदा॥ राज्ञो माहात्मिके स्थाने सद्यःशौचं विधीयते । प्रजानां परिरक्षार्थमासनं चात्र कारणम्॥ मनु V. 93-94. The first verse is the same as Vasiṣṭha 19.48 (Furher's text is corrupt, which must be corrected into नाघदोषोस्ति) which cites it as Yama's. It is the position that he holds that renders the king (whether a kṣatriya brāhmaṇa or śūdra) free from āśauca. The विष्णुधर्मसूत्र (22.47-52) restricts the absence of āśauca by saying 'kings are free from āśauca when they are berek forming the duties of a king (such as administration of justice)': 'न राज्ञां राजकर्मणि न व्रतिनां व्रते न सत्रिणां सत्रे न कारूणां स्वकर्मणि न राजाज्ञाकारिणां तदिच्छ्या।'.

##### brahmacārin, yati, vānaprastha, r̥tvik, 
Similarly, Gobhilasmṛti[^668] (III. 64-65, often quoted as Chandogapariśiṣṭa of Katyāyana ) states 

> 'in a sūtaka, a brahmacārin should not give up his peculiar duties (Veda study and vratas),  
> a sacrificer his various actions ( required ) in a sacrifice after he has undergone dikṣā,  
> one who is practising penance should not give up krcchra and the like;  
> these do not incur impurity even on the death of their father (or mother )'. 

The Kūrmapurāṇa[^669] provides 

> 'no impurity is declared on death in the case of perpetual or temporary brahmacārins, forest hermits or ascetics'. 

Similar rules are given by Atri 97-98, Linga-purāṇa, pūrvabhāga, chap. 89.77. The Mit. on Yāj. III, 28 remarks that in the case of the three āśramas of _brahmacārin_, _vānaprastha_ and _yati_ there is freedom from impurity in all cases and at all times; ascetics and brahmacārins have to undergo a bath with clothes on the death of their father or mother (Dharmasindhu p. 442); in the case of several others such as those who are continually making gifts or are observing vratas there is freedom from impurity only when they are engaged in those particular actions and not when they are engaged in any action whatever or when they mix up among others for everyday work[^670]. 

Similar rules occur in Parāśara III, 21-22. It has already been stated following Manu V. 91 ( = Viṣṇu 22.86 ) that a brahmacārin was not to perform the last rites (of carrying the corpse, cremation) for anybody except for five persons (viz. his parents, upadhyāya, ācārya and guru). He did not incur āśauca by performing the funeral rites of his parents and offering water and piṇḍa to them. But if he did so for any one other than the five mentioned by Manu he had to observe āśauca for ten days, and to undergo prāyaścitta and had his _upanayana_ performed again. 

A brahmacārin had to observe after _samāvartana_ (returning from the Vedic teacher) āśauca for three days for all relatives that died during the period of his studenthood (Manu V. 88, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 22.87). 

##### Misc
Gautama (14. 42-44) says generally[^671] that on the death of children (before the appearance of teeth or before Cūda), of those who are separated by a country, of ascetics and of those who are not sapiṇḍas, the relatives are purified by only a bath; so also there is sadyaḥśauca for kings, for otherwise there would be conflict with their duty of protecting the subjects and for a brāhmaṇa also in order that there may be no cessation of Vedic study[^672]. 

The Śuddhiprakāśa (p. 93) remarks that though there is no āśauca ( as stated by Yāj. III. 28 ) yet a sacrificial priest and a diksita had to bathe on the death of a sapiṇda, a brahmacārin also would have to take a bath if he followed the funeral procession of his father or mother &c., but an ascetic would not have even to bathe and that usage was the same in its day.

[^668]: न त्यजेत्सूतके कर्म ब्रह्मचारी स्वकं क्वचित्। न दीक्षणात्परं यज्ञे न कृच्छादि तपश्चरन् ॥ पितर्यपि मृते नैषां दोषो भवति कर्हिचित् । गोभिलस्मृति III. 64-65 q. by हारलता p. 107, अपरार्क p. 919, शद्धिकल्प. p 64.

I. 2. p. 254. देवल has almost the same verse, नैष्ठिकानां...शौचं सूतके प्रोक्तं शावे वापि तथैव च ॥ q.by परा.मा. I. 2. p. 254, निर्णयसिन्धु p. 543. A similar verse occurs in लिङ्गपुराण (पूर्वार्ध) chap. 89.77.

[^670]: सत्रिणां व्रतिनां सत्रे व्रते च शुद्धिर्न कर्ममात्रे संव्यवहारे वा । ... ब्रहावद्यतिः। एतेषां च त्रयाणमाश्रमिणां सर्वत्र शुद्धिः। विशेषे प्रमाणाभावात् । मिता. on या. III. 28.

[^671]: बालदेशान्तरितप्रव्रजितासपिण्डानां सद्यःशौचम् । राज्ञां च कार्यविरोधात् । ब्राह्मणस्य च स्वाध्यायनिवृत्त्यर्थम् । गौ. 14.42-44. पराशर III. 10 and वामनपुराण 14.99-100 contain verses almost in the same words as the first sūtra.

[^672]: शिल्पिनः कारुका वैद्या दासीदासाश्च नापिताः। राजानः श्रोत्रियाश्चैव सद्यःशौचाः प्रकीर्तिताः ॥ सव्रतः सत्रपूतश्च आहिताग्निश्च यो द्विजः। राज्ञश्च सूतकं नास्ति यस्य चेेच्छति पार्थिवः ॥ पराशर III.20-21.

### Craftsmen etc.

The second class of exceptions refers to cases where certain persons, though they have incurred āśauca, are allowed to do certain acts or carry on their activities without bringing pollution to those with whom they deal or come in contact. For example, Parāśara (III. 20-21) says; 

> 'craftsmen (such as those who draw pictures or washermen), workers (cooks and the like), physicians, male and female slaves, barbers, kings and _śrotriyas_ are declared to be sadyaḥśauca, as also one observing a _vrata_ (cândrāyana &c.), one purified by being engaged in a sattra (such as Gavām-ayana), a brāhmaṇa who has established śrauta fires; the king has not to observe āśauca and also any one (such as his purohita) whom the king for his own purpose desires not to observe it.' 

The Adipurāṇa[^673] gives the reason why craftsmen, physicians and others were allowed not to observe āśauca when engaged in their peculiar tasks, viz. what these people do cannot be done by any one else at all or at least so well or so easily.

[^673]: तथा चादिपुराणे। शिल्पिनश्चित्रकाराद्याः कर्म यत्साधयन्त्यलम् । तत्कर्म नान्यो जानाति तस्माच्छुद्धाः स्वकर्मणि। सूपकारेण यत्कर्म करणीयं नरेष्विह । तदन्यो नैव जानाति तस्माच्छुद्धः स सूपकृत्॥ चिकित्सको यत्कुरुते तदन्येन न शक्यते। तस्माञ्चिकित्सकः स्पर्श शुद्धो भवति नित्यशः॥ दास्यो दासाश्च यत्किंचित् कुर्वन्त्यपि च लीलया। तदन्यो न क्षमः कर्तुं तस्मात्ते शुचयः सदा ॥ राजा करोति यत्कर्म स्वमेप्यन्यस्य तत्कथम् । एवं सति नृपः शुद्धः संस्पर्शे मृतसूतके॥ यत्कर्म राजभृत्यानां हस्त्यश्वगमनादिकम् । तन्नास्ति यस्मादन्यस्य तस्मात्ते शुचयः स्मृताः॥q. by परा. मा. I. 2. pp. 255-256. Three of these from सूपकारेण are quoted as from बह्मपुराण by हारलता p. 110, as from आदिपुराण by शुद्धितत्त्व pp. 289-90 and all from सूपकारेण onwards are quoted from आदिपुराण by शुद्धिप्र. p. 95; the verse चिकित्सको० is q. by मिता. on या III 27.

It has[^674] to be noted that the absence of āśausa in the case of craftsmen, physicians and the like has to be restricted to the peculiar activities of these and does not extend to all actions such as religious rites, śrāddhas and gifts. This is clear from the words of the Viṣṇudharmasūtra[^675] 22. 48-52. The Trimśacchloki (verse 18)[^676] gives a long list of such peculiar activities. The Kūrmapurāṇa (Uttarārdha 23. 57-64) has nine verses on this topic which are quoted by the Hāralatā (p. 114).

It has already been seen (pp. 238–240) that Pār. gr. III. 10 (nityāni vinivartante vaitānavarjam), Manu. V. 84, Yaj. III. 17 (latter half) provide that even those who have to undergo āśauca on death should not stop rites to be performed with śrauta fires, but should perform them themselves or get them performed through others. Thus certain religious rites were allowed to be done even by those who were _āśaucin_.

The Dharmasindhu (p. 552) emphasizes that this exception to aśauca should be availed of only when there is no other alternative or in a season of distress.

It has already been stated how certain materials and things can be received without any pollution from those who are undergoing āśauca. That is the third class of cases which are exceptions to the rules of āśauca.

### Suicides, criminals etc.
Cases of no āśauca

The fourth class of cases where rules of āśauca do not apply relate to persons deceased to whom some fault or taint attaches, Gaut. (14, 11)[^677] and Śaṅkha-Likhita provide that there is sadyaḥśauca for those who kill themselves (i.e. commit suicide) by starting on the great journey (to the Himālaya), by fasting, by a weapon (like a dagger), by fire or poison or water or by hanging or by falling down from a precipice.

Yāj. III. 6 provides[^678] that women that have gone over to heterodox views and practices, that do not belong to any particular _āśrama_, that are thieves (of gold and the like), that (attempt to kill their husbands, that are unchaste and the like, that drink liquor and that attempt suicide, do not deserve to have water offered to them (on death) and no āśauca should be observed for them. This verse applies to men also as far as possible. Manu V. 89-90 are to the same effect. 

The Kūrmapurāṇa also prescribes[^679] that for him who kills himself by means of fire, poison and the like, no āśauca, no cremation and no offering of water is prescribed, there is no cremation for _patitas_, nor _antyeṣṭi_ nor collection of bones, no shedding of tears and no piṇḍa and no śrāddha should be performed for them. It is provided by Angiras quoted by Mit. on Yāj. III. 6 that 

> 'death results to evil-minded men from cāṇḍālas (with whom a quarrel is purposely got up), from water, from a snake, from a brāhmaṇa, from lightning and from animals that have sharp fangs (like tigers). If water and piṇḍa are offered to such people (who die wilfully in these cases) they (water and piṇḍa) do not reach them and perish in mid air.' 

These verses refer to death in a wrathful fight with tigers, snakes and the like or suicide in water through wrath or sorrow. But, if one died in water or by fire through inadvertence or negligence, then Aṅgiras[^680] himself provides that water should be offered and aśauca should be observed. 

Long passages are quoted from the Brahmapurāṇa by Haradatta on Gaut. 14. 11, Śuddhiprakāśa pp. 56-57, Nirṇayasindhu p. 550, which elaborate the same ideas as those of Yaj. III. 6, Angiras and others and wind up by stating that if any one offers water or śraddha to _patitas_ through affection or cremates them, he has to undergo prāyaścitta (viz. two Taptakṛcchras).

[^678]: For या. III. 6 read p. 222 above. अपरार्क reads 'पाषण्डानाश्रिताः' and explains 'पाषण्डान्बौद्धादीनाश्रिताः तद्दीक्षायां प्रविष्टाः,while the मिता reads पाखण्डयमाश्रिताः and makes two different classes.

[^679]: पतितानां न दाहः ; vide note 522 above; the आग्निपुराण (159.2-4) states 'आत्मनस्त्यागिनां नास्ति पतितानां तथा क्रिया। तेषामपि तथा गाङ्गे तोयेऽस्थ्नां पतनं हितम् । तेषां दत्तं जलं चान्नं गगने तत्प्रलीयते । अनुग्रहेण महता प्रेतस्य पतितस्य च। नारायणबलिः कार्यस्तेनानुग्रहमश्रुते॥.'

If an _āhitāgni_ were killed by cāṇḍālas in defiant fight with them or commits suicide, his corpse should be got cremated by śūdras without proper mantras and Gobhilasmṛti (III. 49-51) provides for the disposal of his śrauta fires and sacrificial implements. 

#### Mahāprasthāna
Though suicide was generally condemned, the smṛtis (such as Atri 218-219) and Purāṇas allowed certain exceptions, viz. very old men (above 70), very weak men who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or those who have no desire left for the pleasures of the senses or who have carried out all tasks and duties, may start on _Mahāprasthāna_ or die at Prayāga. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 926-928 for detailed treatment of this topic. 

If a man killed himself in the way allowed by the śāstra then there was no blemish and āśauca had to be observed and water and srāddha had to be offered. 

It may be noted that starting on Mahāprasthāna and suicide on the part of old men by falling down from a precipice or in fire are forbidden in the Kali age. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III p. 939 and pp. 958-959.

#### Nārāyaṇabali described

The Mit. on Yāj. III. 6 quotes Vṛddha-Yājñavalkya and Chāgaleya to the effect that in the case of those who commit suicide in any manner that is not sanctioned by the śāstras, Nārāyaṇabali should be performed one year after their death and then the rites of śrāddha may be performed thereafter, The Mit.[^681] on Yāj. III. 6, relying on Viṣṇupurāṇa describes the Nārāyaṇabali as follows: 

> On the 11th day of the bright half of a month, having worshipped Viṣṇu and Yama, one should with the face to the south offer near them on _darbhas_ with ends turned towards the south ten piṇḍas laved with honey and ghee and mixed with sesame after bringing to mind the deceased[^682] who should be looked upon as having the form of Viṣṇu and having uttered the name and gotra of the deceased;  
> he should honour the piṇḍas with sandalwood paste and the rest and having performed all the rites up to the removal of piṇḍas, should cast them in a river and not give them to the wife or to others.  
> 
> Then on the night of the same day he should invite an uneven number of brāhmaṇas, should observe a fast, should worship Viṣṇu the next day, in the noon he should perform all the rites from washing the feet of brāhmaṇas up to the query about the gratification of the brāhmaṇas (by the food served to them) according to the procedure of _ekoddiṣṭa_ śrāddha,  
> then he should silently go through all the rites from _ullekhana_ (drawing lines) up to _avanejana_ (anointing) by the procedure of Piṇḍa-pitṛyajña. He should offer four piṇḍas to (images of) Viṣṇu, Brahmā, Śiva and Yama together with the attendants, should remember the deceased by name and gotra, should utter the name of Viṣṇu and then offer the 5th piṇḍa.  
> Then having gratified the brāhmaṇas (after they have sipped water) with fee, he should bring to his mind one of the brāhmaṇas) that is the most qualified of all as representing the deceased and having gratified him to the utmost with the gifts of cows, land and money,  
> should then make the brāhmaṇas that have _pavitras_ on their hands offer to the deceased water together with sesame and should then take his meal along with his relatives.

The passage quoted by the Mit, makes it clear that Nārāyaṇabali is meant only for those who commit suicide and is to be offered one year after the death of the person guilty of suicide. The Hāralatā[^683] (p. 212) also says the same and explains a verse of Viṣṇu extending the performance of Nārāyaṇabali to those killed by cows and brāhmaṇas and those who become _patita_ as a usage restricted to a certain country only[^684].

A long passage is quoted from आदिपुराण in हारलता pp. 203-205, the last Verses of which are: क्रियते पतितानां तु गते संवत्सरे क्वचित् । <u> देशधर्मप्रमाणत्वात् </u> गयाकूपेषु बन्धुभिः । मार्तण्डपादमूले वा श्राद्धं हरिहरं स्मरन् ।

[^684]: Nārāyaṇabali is described in the Appendix B to the Sholapur District Gazetteer in Bom, Gaz, vol. XX. pp. 522-523.

The Antyeṣṭipaddhati of Nārāyaṇabhatta describes (on folio 187) Nārāyaṇabali rite at greater length than in the Mitākṣarā. One or two details may be pointed out. 

Five kalaśas (jars) are to be placed over a quantity of rice or _yavas_, then filled with water, then have the three mantras "Āpo hi ṣṭha".(Ṛg. X 9.1-3) repeated over them, then copper plates are to be placed over them on which five images of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Śiva, Yama and the deceased are to be drawn and the worship of these five is to be performed respectively with the Puruṣasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90), Ṛg. X. 121. 1-10, Ṛg. I. 43. 1 (= Tai. A. X, 17), Ṛg.X, 14.13 and the name and gotra of the deceased, sixteen oblations of cooked rice are to be offered to Nārāyaṇa with the sixteen verses of the Puruṣasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90). 

Ten piṇdas[^685] are to be offered on _darbhas_ to the deceased after repeating his name and gotra (as atated in the note below). After the ten piṇḍas are cast in a river, there is _tarpaṇa_ of the deceased sixteen times with the sixteen stanzas of the Puruṣasūkta. Then _bali_ is offered separately to Viṣṇu, Brahmā, Śiva and Yama with his servants.

In the Mitākṣarā, there is no homa nor bali, both of which are described in the Antyeṣṭipaddhati and the Smṛtyarthasāra (pp. 85-86 ) copies verbatim the procedure given in the Mit. Bṛhatparāśara (V. pp. 175-176) contains the same procedure that is set out by the Mit. from the Viṣṇupurāṇa. 

The Nirṇayasindhu first describes Nārāyaṇabali as gathered from Hemādri and the Garudapurāṇa (III. 4. 113–119). It then describes Nārāyaṇabali to be performed for a deceased ascetic on the 12th day (along with Pārvanaśrāddha), following the procedure laid down by Baudhāyana. It then describes another form of Nārāyaṇabali based on Śaunaka which is meant for all those who commit suicide or who are killed by cāṇḍālas[^686] snakes, lightning, animals with fangs or who die in a distant land or for ascetics and _yogins_. The Vṛddha-Hāritasmṛti (IX. 123-143) describes another method of Nārāyaṇabali for devotees of Viṣṇu.



[^685]: अर्चितदेवसमीपे अमुकगोत्रायामुकशर्मणे प्रेताय विष्णुरूपिणेऽयं विष्णुः- इति मधुघृताफ्लुतांस्तिलमिश्रान्दश पिण्डान् विष्णुरूपिणं प्रेतमनुस्मरन् प्रेतस्य नामगोत्रे उच्चार्य दक्षिणाग्रेषु दर्भेषु दक्षिणामुखोऽपसव्येन दत्त्वा । ततः पुरुषसूक्तेन प्रेतस्य नामगोत्रे उक्त्वा अमुकं नारायणरूपं तर्पयामीति षोडशवारं तर्पयेत्प्रत्यृचम् । अन्त्येष्टिपद्धति.

[^686]: चाण्डालादुदकात्सर्पादब्राह्मणाद्वैद्युतादपि । दंष्टिभ्यश्च पशुभ्यश्च मरणं पापकर्मिणाम् ॥ बौ.गृ. शेषसूत्र III. 21. The same is q. by अपरार्क p. 877 as यम's, as स्मृत्यन्तर by शुद्धिप्र . p. 56 and without name by the मिता, on या. III. 6.

The Vaikhānasa-smārtasūtra (X. 9) sets out a rather brief procedure of Nārāyaṇabali which was intended for the benefit of men who committed suicide or were slain and for ascetics and provides that the same may be performed for those guilty of _mahāpātakas_ after twelve years from their death. The Baudhāyana-gṛhya-śeṣasūtra III. 20 and 21 contain two different sets of the procedure of Nārāyaṇabali, the latter of which appears to be the later one. The latter contains the well-known Verse about death at the hands of cāṇḍālas, from a snake &c.

### Heroes
The 5th class of exceptions to āśauca rules comprises those that are declared by express texts as not liable to observe an āśauca. Gautama (14. 8-10) provides[^687] that (the sapiṇḍas) of those that met death for the sake of cows and brāhmaṇas, of those that met death through the wrath of the king and those that were killed in battle have to observe no āśauca but only 'sadyaḥśauca'. 

Manu V. 95 and 98 state[^688] that (the sapiṇḍas) of those that are killed in a sudden affray or by lightning or by the king (for an offence) or of those that met death in protecting cows and brāhmaṇas and of one who was killed in the fashion of kṣatriyas in a battle by the sword have to observe no aśauca, as also he whom the king desires (for his purpose) to observe no āśauca. 

It is provided by Śatātapa[^689] that as regards a _yati_ dying, his sons and other sapiṇḍas are not to offer water or piṇḍa to him or to observe āśauca for him. The Dharmasindhu (p. 449) says that this applies to all ascetics, whether they be _tridaṇḍin_ or _ekadaṇḍin_, _haṁsas_ or _paramahaṁsas_. So also on the death of a vānaprastha there is no āśauca. 

In the case of one who has performed his own śrāddha while alive his sapiṇḍas have an option either to observe āśauca or not. On the death of a brahmacārin āśauca is to be observed. 

The Dharmasindhu further notes that in all works it is stated that there is no āśauca[^690] for one killed in battle, but at least among brāhmaṇas (i.e, as to brāhmanas killed in battle) the usage of the _śiṣṭas_ is different (i.e, āśauca is observed).

[^687]:  गोब्राह्मणहतानामन्वक्षम् । राजक्रोधाच्च । युद्धे । गौ. 14 8-10. हरदत्त explains 'अन्वक्ष्यते प्रत्यक्ष्यते शवस्तावत्संस्कारान्ते स्नात्वा शुध्येरन्निति', while the मिता. on या. III. 21 (first half) explains 'तत्सम्बन्धिनां चान्वक्षमनुगतमक्षमन्वक्षं सद्यःशौचमित्यर्थः.' The मिताक्षरा takes the corresponding passage of Yāj. III. 21 (first half) to mean 'of those that were killed by the king, by bulls or brāhmaṇas'. The मिता reads राजक्रोधाच्चायुद्धे, while हरदत्त says that he does not like to read अयुद्धे but would read आयुद्धे.

[^688]: डिम्बाहवे हतानां च विद्यता पार्थिवेन च। गोब्राह्मणस्य चैवाथै यस्य चेच्छति पार्थिवः ॥ मनु V. 95. डिम्बाहव is explained by कुल्लूक and हारलता (p. 111) as 'नृपतिरहितं युद्धं,' while हरदत्त takes डिम्ब to mean जनसंमर्द and अपरार्क p. 916 explains डिम्बाहव as अशस्त्रकलह and शुद्धिकल्पतरु as अशस्त्रकलहः संमर्दो वा (p. 46).

[^689]: एकोद्दिष्टं जलं पिण्डमाशौचं प्रेतसत्क्रियाम् । न कुर्यात्पार्वणादन्यद् ब्रह्मीभूताय भिक्षवे ॥ शातातप। स्मृतिच (आशौच) p. 171 ascribes this to वसिष्ठ.

[^690]: युद्धमृतेप्याशौचं नेति सर्वग्रन्थेषूपलभ्यते न त्वेवं ब्राह्मणेषु शिष्टाचार इति । धर्मसिन्धु p. 449.

### Uncertainty
Parāśara (III. 12-13) provides that, if a man has gone for many years to a distant land and it is ascertained that he died there but the exact date of his death is not known, then either of three _tithis_ viz. the 8th or 11th day of the dark half or the amāvāsyā should be accepted as the day of his death and water, piṇḍa and śrāddha should be offered on that date and the Par. M.I.2 p. 237 adds that āśauca also must be calculated from that date. On the other hand Laghu-Harita says that if there is some obstacle at the time of a śrāddha or when the date of death is not known, then the funeral rites should be performed on the 11th tithi of the following dark half (Śuddhikaumudi p. 17).

### desha-dharma
The digests lay particular emphasis on the fact that in matters of aśauca the usages of a country must be observed. The Haralatā (pp. 55, 205) quotes passages from the Ādipurāṇa where special reference is made to the authority of the usages of a country (deśa-dharma-pramāṇatvāt). The Śuddhitattva p. 275 quotes[^691] a verse of Marici 

> 'one should not disregard the manner of observing śauca and religious usages that are current in particular localities; the dharma is of that sort alone in those localities'. 

On p. 276 it quotes a passage of the Vāmanapurāṇa to the same effect.

It deserves to be noted that Dakṣa[^692] (VI. 15) states that all rules about āśauca apply when the times are easy and peaceful but when a man is overwhelmed by distress there is no (enforcement or application) of the (rules of) āśauca.

[^691]: तथा च मरीचिः। येषु स्थानेषु यच्छौचं धर्माचारश्च यादृशः। तत्र तन्नावमन्येत धर्मस्तत्रैव तादृशः॥ रुद्रधर in शुद्धिविवेक (D.C. ms. No 309 of 1887-91, folio 77 b), शु. कौ. p. 360, शुद्धितत्व p. 275%; "तथा च वामनपुराणं 'देशानुशिष्टं कुलधर्ममग्न्यं स्वगोत्रधर्म न हि संत्यजेच्च" शुद्धितस्व P, 276.

[^692]: स्वस्थकाले तथा सर्वे सूतकं परिकीर्तितम् । आपद्ग्रस्तस्य सर्वस्य सूतकेपि न सूतकम् ॥ दक्ष VI. 15.


### Purification
Viṣṇu (19. 18-19) provides[^693] that at the end of the period of aśauca one should go out of the village, get himself shaved and take a bath after applying a thick paste of sesame or white mustard to the body, change garments and then re-enter the house. Then he should perform a _śānti_ (propitiatory rite) and honour brāhmaṇas.

[^693]: ग्रामान्निष्क्रम्याशौचान्ते कृतश्श्रुुकर्माणस्तिलकल्कैः सर्षपकल्कैर्वा स्नाता परिवर्तितवाससो गृहं प्रविशेयुः । तत्र शान्तिं कृत्वा ब्राह्मणानां च पूजनं कुर्युः । विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 19.18--19.

Many medieval digests provide for a more elaborate procedure. For example, the Śuddhikaumudi (pp. 155-164) sets out the procedure of the 11th day separately for the followers of the three Vedas. A few salient points may be mentioned. 

After a bath for the whole body, the sapiṇḍas should touch a cow, gold, fire, _dūrvā_, clarified butter and repeat the name of Govinda, then engage brāhmaṇas to sprinkle śānti water over them and say 'svasti'. If a brāhmana cannot be had, one should himself perform śanti. The Hāralatā and others say that without śānti water āśauca is not completely removed. 

The followers of Sāmaveda should sing the Vámadevagāna for sānti or should repeat the four Vāmadevya verses viz. 'kayā naścitra,' 'kastvā satyo,' "abhi ṣū ṇaḥ' (No. 682-684 of the Samaveda) together with the last verse of the Sāmaveda 'svasti na Indro') preceded and followed by the sacred Gayatri; these form the śānti mantras for Samavedins. For followers of Yajurveda seventeen mantras beginning with ‘ṛcam vācam prapadye' and ending with 'dyauḥ śāntiḥ', preceded and followed by the Gāyatri form the śānti mantras; the Ṛgvedins should employ for śanti Ṛg. X. 9. 4, VII, 35, 1, V. 47. 7 &c. preceded and followed by the Gāyatri. Then some gold with silver as dakṣiṇā should be donated to a brāhmaṇa, then the Vaitaraṇi cow should be donated, if one was not given at the approach of death, then a gift of the bedstead &c. should be made.

### Simplification
We have seen (p. 270) that originally the sūtras (like Sān. Sr.) and smṛtis (like Manu) emphasized that one should not increase the number of the days of āśauca and that men learned in the Veda and consecrating śrauta fires had to undergo only one day's āśauca (Parāśara III. 5, Dakṣa VI. 6). But ultimately a flat period of ten days of aśauca (Manu V.59) for all sapiṇḍas came to be prescribed. 

In the old days the means of communication were very limited, and hence the news of a birth or death must have taken considerable time to reach relatives staying even at a short distance and hence the restrictions imposed by the rules of āśauca were not felt to be very irksome. It is on account of this reason and also the great _penchant_ of dharmaśāstra writers for all sorts of divisions, sub-divisions and Classifications that we find medieval writers bestowing an enormously exaggerated attention in very exuberant and enthusiastic style on such a subject as āśauca. Most nations have their own usages to indicate that a person (male or female) or a family is in mourning. But probably no country in the world can equal (much less surpass) the Dharmaśāstra writers in the elaborate rules evolved in books about āśauca on birth and death. 

In these days when there is a State postal system and the means of communication abound owing to railways, air mail, telegraph and wireless, the ancient and medieval rules of āśauca are felt by all people to be most galling and troublesome. Mischievous people sometimes create trouble in the celebration of marriages by sending information about a death or a birth to persons against whom they have a grudge. Devices have to be employed for dodging the inconvenience due to rules of āśauca. It is therefore necessary to introduce substantial changes in the rules about āśauca that will prevent trouble, loss of time and work and would at the same time be more or less in agreement with the spirit of the dicta of the smṛtis and the sentiments of most common people. At the end in the appendix note[^693a] is added which gives the text of the Āśauca-daśaka with Sanskrit explanation.+++(Why mention here??)+++

Source: [TW](https://archive.org/details/kANe_history_of_dharmashAstra-s/v4/page/308/mode/2up?view=theater)

As regards _āśauca_ on birth I would recommend that hereafter in the changed set-up of society in these days one simple rule should be observed, viz. it is only the mother that has to observe impurity for ten days and no one else has to observe impurity on birth. This is in general accordance with the ancient smṛtis set out above,

As regards impurity on death four rules should ordinarily suffice[^693a].

(1) _Āśauca_ for ten days on death should be observed by the father and the mother for the son and by the son for the parents, by the wife for the husband and _vice versa_ and by one who performs the rites of cremation and the rites after death.

(2) For others (than the above) staying near the deceased as members of a joint family āśauca for only three days should suffice.

(3) For all other relatives of the deceased whenever the news of death may reach them within a year after death, only a bath should be enough.

(4) When the death occurred more than a year before the news reached the relatives not even a bath should be required in the case of any relative except those mentioned in the first rule, who should be held clean after a bath,

### Speculation on origin

Most important tabus

Practices observed among ancient and modern primitive tribes show that the most important _tabus_ were those on the dead, on women in child-birth and women in their monthly illness. 

- Among the ancient Israelites all that were unclean through the dead were put outside the camp and they were not allowed to offer an offering at the Passover (Numbers V.1-4 and IX, 6). 
- Among the Syrians those who belonged to the family of the dead man were _tabu_ for 30 days and could then enter only with shaven heads. Child-birth made a woman unclean and the number of days that she was to be unclean depended on whether the child was a male or a female (Leviticus 12. 2-5). 
  
In India also the ancient Aryans probably inherited their ideas about uncleanness on death and child-birth from their remote ancestors. If one may surmise one can say this: it must have been found out by the remote ancestors of the Vedic Aryans that if a person touched a dead body or used the clothes worn by the dead man when living, he also suffered from the same disease (particularly in the case of contagious diseases like plague, cholera, typhoid &c.) and that segregating such a person for ten days from other members of the tribe or community made the latter immune from the attack of such diseases. Therefore, those who touched the dead or carried the corpse for cremation or burial and the members of the family were thought to be unclean and were segregated for ten days. 

Gradually the ideas about the uncleanness on death and the necessity of segregation were made applicable to death due to all diseases or causes whatever. The uncleanness on childbirth might have been a case of extension by analogy derived from the _tabu_ on death. At all events smṛti writers put both on the same level (e. g. Manu V. 61 "Just as impurity on death is ordained for ten days in the case of sapiṇḍas the same holds good in the case of birth"). Rules about women in their monthly illness were prescribed as early as the Tai.S. and have been already dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 802-805.

## śuddhi
We have now to turn to the subject of _śuddhi_ apart from _āśauca_. Śuddhi of a _dravya_ means the[^694] removal of a taint attaching to a thing and it is of two kinds, purification of the body and the purification of an external object (Manu  V.110 and Aparārka p. 253). It has already been seen (note 555 above) how even the Ṛg. lays great emphasis on śuddhi and being pure (śuci). There are Vedic[^695] passages laying down that the cups (_grahas_) used in Jyotiṣṭoma and other sacrifices were to be cleansed with a strainer of wool, but not the _camasas_. In the Ait. Br. 32.4 it is provided that if the milk of an _agnihotrin_ that was heated by him for the _homa_ became impure (_amedhya_, by an ant or worm falling therein ), the milk is to be taken up in an agnihotrahavaṇi and was to be poured upon the ashes near the Āhavaniya fire. This shows that great care was taken about the purity of vessels to be used in sacrifices and about the offerings to be made. 

_Śauca_ is one of the eight qualities of the soul (_ātmaguṇas_) mentioned by Gaut. 8.24, Atri (verses 33, 35), Matsyapurāṇa 52. 8-10, Bṛhaspati (q. by Aparārka p. 164). Haradatta on Gautama quotes a verse that śauca is of four kinds viz. monetary purity, mental purity, bodily purity and purity in speech; while Atri and Bṛhaspati[^696] (q. by Aparārka p. 164), aver that śauca is constituted by avoiding what ought not to be eaten, by associating (only) with those who are not censured (i.e. are not reprehensible ) and by firmly abiding by one's own prescribed duties. 

Many works divide _śauca_ into two varieties viz. _bāhya_ (external) and _antara_ or _ābhyantara_ (internal). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 651-52 for passages from Baudhāyana Dh. S. (I. 5. 3-4), Harita, Dakṣa and others defining and subdividing these. Agni 372. (17-18) is the same as Dakṣa V.3. 

The Vanaparva 200.52 speaks of purity in speech, in actions and that brought about by water, The Padma (II. 66. 86-87) emphasizes that it is the mental attitude that is the highest thing and illustrates it by saying that a woman embraces her son and her husband with different mental states. 

There is an interesting passage in the Lingapurāṇa 8. 34-36 (not quoted there) which after stating that _ābhyantara_ śauca is superior to _bāhya śauca_ (verse 31) remarks[^697] that one void of inner purity is dirty even after a bath, that moss, fish and animals subsisting on fish are always immersed in water, that in spite of that no one would call them pure, that therefore one must always endeavour to secure inner purity and that one should bathe in the water of correct knowledge of the Self, apply once the sandal paste of faith and purify oneself by the clay in the form of desirelessness and that this is declared to be the real) _śauca_. 

Manu V. 106 provides that of all kinds of purity mental purity is the highest. He who is pure as to wealth (i. e. who does not deprive another of wealth by unjust means) is the (only) pure man and not he who is purified by water and earth. Viṣṇu 22. 89 is the same except that for wealth (_artha_) it substitutes food (_anna_). The Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana (prakirṇaka 21) has the same verse as Manu V. 106. Vide also Anuśāsana 108, 12 (for purity of conduct, of mind, of a holy place, purity due to correct philosophical knowledge ); Brahmāṇḍa III. 14. 60 (śucikāmā hi devā vai), and Yogasūtra II, 32 (for śauca as one of the five niyamas).

### Body purity
External purity of the body by various means (rinsing the mouth, bath & c.) has already been described in detail in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 648-668. The ancient and medieval Indians insisted on a daily bath for all, recommended two baths a day in certain cases and three baths to a hermit and did not subscribe to the view of some of the early Christians. St. Agnes was canonized primarily for her refusal to bathe and St. Francis of Assisi considered dirt as one of the proper insignia of holy poverty[^698].

In śrauta rites ( such as Agniṣṭoma ) the sacrificer had to undergo a severe discipline of consecration (or dikṣā), one item of which was the purification of the intending sacrificer's body by the _adhvaryu_ priest by rubbing the former's body twice with three bunches of seven darbhas each (vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 1136). Śatātapa q. by Sm. C. I. p. 120, Śuddhiprakāśa p. 147 provide bath for one who has sexual intercourse with his wife during the period from the 5th to the 16th day after monthly illness begins, but for intercourse after these days the purification is the same as for urination and voiding ordure ; bath is also prescribed for vomiting after sunrise, after shaving, after a bad dream, on the touch of foul men (such as cândālas).

[^698]: Vide Reginald Reynolds' work on ' Cleanliness and godliness' p.36 (chapter IV).

The Ap. Śr. II. 12 provides[^699] that _Pavitreṣṭi_ should be performed by him who is desirous of _śuddhi_ and that if one performs in each season the three _iṣṭis_, viz. Vaiśvānarī (to Agni Vaiśvānara), Vrātapati (to Agni Vratapati) and the Pavitreṣṭi one purifies ten generations (of his family ).

### Infants
Parts of the body that are deemed pure

The following pages will deal with the purification of things (_dravyaśuddhi_ ). But a few general observations must first be made. The Āp. Dh, S. (II. 6. 15. 17-20) states that infants do not become polluted or impure (by the touch of a woman in her monthly course) up to the time the _saṁskāra of annaprāśana_ (taking cooked food for the first time ), that, according to some, up to one year or as long as they cannot distinguish between the different directions or up to the time of _Upanayana_ according to others. 

### General items
Manu V. 127-133, Yaj. I. 186, 191-193, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 23. 47-52, Baud, Dh. I. 5. 56-57, 64, 65, Śaṅkha 16. 12-16, Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa 35. 19-21 state that the following are always pure: 

- what is not seen to be polluted;  
- what is cleansed with water; 
- what is commended expressly (by a brāhmaṇa as pure, when there is a doubt),
- water collected on (pure) ground that is not visibly polluted by an impure thing and that in quantity is so much that a cow can slake its thirst therein and that has the smell, colour and taste of pure water;
- the hand of a craftsman (such as a washerman or a cook while engaged in his peculiar work);
- articles exposed for sale in a market such as rice and barley (though touched by many intending buyers);
- alms (collected by a _brahmacārin_ though walking from house to house on the road);
- the mouth of a woman (at the time of dalliance);
- meat of animals seized or killed even by dogs, cāṇḍālas, and carnivorous birds;
- rays (of the sun), fire, dust, the shadow (of a tree or the like), a cow, a horse, land, wind, dew drops, flies, a calf at the time of making the cow flow with milk from the udder- these latter are pure when they come in contact with a person. 
  
Then it was said that certain birds and animals were either always pure or as to certain parts of the body e. g. Yāj. I. 194 says that the mouths of goats and horses are pure but not of the cow.

[^699]: शुद्धिकामो वा। तदेषाभियज्ञगाथा गीयते । वैश्वानरीं वातपतिं पवित्रेष्टिं तथैव च । ऋतावृतौ प्रयुञ्जानो पुनाति दशपौरुषम् ॥ इति । आश्व.श्रौ. II. 12.

Baudhāyana[^700] quoted by Aparārka p. 276 provides that the cow is pure except as to its mouth, and a cat when it is leaping or moving about. Bṛhaspati[^701] and Yama (q. by Aparārka p. 276) state: 

> 'the feet of brāhmaṇas, and the mouth of goats and horses, the backs of cows and all limbs of women are pure; the cow as to its back, the elephant as to its shoulder, the horse as to all its limbs and the dung and urine of cows, all these are pure'. 

Atri (240, 241) contains several verses[^702] on this point. 

> 'Things taken out from a mine or from kitchens (or places where grain is pounded &c.) are never impure, since all such places (where anything is prepared in the mass ) except a place for the manufacture of liquor are pure. 
> 
> All fried (or roasted) things, fried barley and grain, dates, camphor, whatever else is well fried is pure'. 

In Atri V. 13 we read[^703] 

> 'flies, a continuous stream (of any liquid), the earth, water, fire, a cat, a wooden ladle and a mongoose are always pure'. 

Parāśara (X. 41) states:[^794] 

> "space (ākāsa), wind, fire, water fallen on the earth, darbhas are not to be deemed polluted just as _camasas_ in sacrifices are held to be not polluted." 

Par. M. quotes a verse of Caturvimśatimata[^705] that raw meat, ghee, honey, oils extracted from fruits-these even when contained in vessels belonging to caṇḍālas become free from taint the moment they are taken out of these vessels. Bṛhaspati provides:[^706] 

> machines for crushing grapes and sugarcane stalks, mines, the hands of craftsmen, the milk pail, fluids that come out from crushing machines, actions (such as cooking) done by women and children when they are impure (by walking barefooted on the road) and are seen to be so, are still free from taint. One's[^707] own bed, garment, wife, child, water pot these are free from taint for oneself, but these are impure to others. 

Śaṅkha 16.15 is to the same effect.

[^700]: मुखवर्जे तु गौर्मेध्या मार्जारश्चङ्क्रमे (? श्चाक्रमे) शुचिः । बौधायन q. by अपरार्क p. 276; almost the same words occur in शङ्ख 16.14 (latter half).

I.5.58. The शु. कौ. (p.258) after quoting शङ्क 16.13 (शुद्धं नदीगतं तोयं सर्व एव तथाकराः) explains: सर्व एवाकरा धान्यादिमर्दनस्थानानि तथा अन्नलाजादिनिष्पत्तिस्थानानि चेत्यर्थः ।...

### Purification of things

Śaṅkha[^708] states that whatever removes the dirt (or pollution) that is natural to a substance or arises from contact with another polluting substance must be declared to be its purifier. Śaṅkha-Likhita[^709] declare that the substances that bring about purification of all (polluted things) are water, clay, the powder (or paste) of soap berries, bilva fruit, rice and mustard cake, salts (ashes), cow's urine and dung and that according to some when a substance is heaped up in a big mass, sprinkling with water. Manu V. 118, Yāj. I. 184, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 23.13 also provide that sprinkling with water is the mode of purification when large quantities of corn or clothes are polluted, but when the quantity is small they must be washed with water. The quantity is said to be large when it is more than what one man can carry as a load (according to Kullūka on Manu V. 118).

The general rule laid down by Gaut. I. 45–46, Manu V. 126 ( Viṣṇu 23, 39), Yāj. I. 191 about the purification of things or bodies that are smeared with foul matter is that water and earth are to be employed for purification till the foul odour and the contact of the foul thing is entirely removed[^710]. 

Devala (q. by Aparārka p. 270) defines _śauca_ as the removal by means of clay, water, cowdung and the like of the besmearing, the oiliness and odour of a thing that cause impurity.

[^708]: मलं संयोगजं तज्जं यस्य येनोपहन्यते । तस्य तच्छोधनं प्रोक्तं सामान्यं द्रव्यशुद्धिकृत् ॥  शङ्क q. by अपरार्क p. 256, दीपकालका on या. I. 191. मद. पा. p. 451 reads मलसंयोगजम्.

[^709]: सर्वेषामापो मृदरिष्टकेङ्गुदबिल्वतण्डुलसर्षपकल्कक्षारगोमूत्रगोमयादीनि शौचद्रव्याणि संहतानां प्रोक्षणमित्येके । शङ्खलिखितौ q. by चतुर्वर्ग• vol. III. part 1 p. 817

[^710]: लेपगन्धापकर्षणं शौचममेध्याक्तस्य । तदद्भिः पूर्व मृदा च । गौ. ध. सू. I. 49-6.2 Almost the same words occur in वसिष्ठ III.48; यावन्नापैत्यमेध्याक्ताद्गन्धो लेपश्च तत्कृतः। तावन्मृद्वारि चादेयं सर्वासु द्रव्यशुद्धिषु॥ मनु V. 126=विष्णु 23.39.

Gaut. Dh. S. (I. 28-33 ) briefly deals[^710a] with the purification of things as follows: Purification of metallic substances (like bell-metal), earthenware, substances manufactured from wood, cloth made of threads or yarn is brought about respectively by rubbing (or scouring) them, by baking in fire, by chiselling or planing, by washing in water; objects made of stones, jewels, shells and pearls are purified by the same means as metalli substances; bones (ivory and the like) and mud (floor of houses) are purified in the same way as wooden substances; and earth (when polluted) is also purified by adding to it earth (brought from another pure spot); ropes, chips of bamboos and reeds, leather are purified by the same means as cloth or they may be abandoned when they are extremely polluted (as by the spilling of wine or urine or ordure). 

Vas. (III. 49–53) has almost the same words, employing the word 'bhasmaparimārjana' (scouring with ashes and washing ) for 'parimārjana'. 

The Āp. Dh. S. (I. 5. 17. 10–13)[^711] provides: 

> 'If one gets a used vessel only, he shall eat from it after having heated it thoroughly; a vessel made of metal is purified by being scoured with ashes and the like; a wooden vessel becomes pure by being scraped; at a sacrifice, vessels must be cleaned according to the precepts of the Veda.' 

Yaj. (III. 31-34) states; time (lapse of ten days or a year as to āśauca), fire, religious rites (like Aśvamedha or performing of _sandhyā_), clay, wind, mind, spiritual knowledge, austerities (such as kṛcchra), water, repentance (in the case of sins), fasting--all these are the causes of purification. Gifts are the (main) cause of purification for those who do what is forbidden, flow of water in the case of a river, clay and water are means of _śuddhi_ in the case of substances that are not clean, _sannyāsa_ (order of asceticism) in the case of the twice-born +++(4)+++, austerities in the case of those that have studied the Veda when they commit a sin (through ignorance), forbearance in the case of those who know the Self, water in the case of dirty limbs, silent recital of Vedic mantras (_japa_) is the means of purification for those guilty of secret sins +++(4)+++, truth in the case of the mind (that is full of or is polluted by sinful thoughts), austerities and esoteric knowledge in the case of the man who identifies his soul with the body, correct knowledge in the case of intelligence, knowledge of God is the pre-eminent purifier of the soul. 

Manu V. 107-109 (= Vispu 22.90-92 ) contain almost the same idea in almost the same words.

[^710a]: द्रव्यशुद्धिः परिमार्जनप्रदाहतक्षणनिणेजनानि तैजसमातिकदारवतान्तवानाम् । तैजसवटुपलमणिशङ्खमुक्तानाम् । दारुवदस्थिभूम्योः। आवपनं च भूमेः। चैलवद्वज्जुविदलधर्मणाम् । उत्सगों पात्यन्तोपहतानाम् । गौ. 1.28-33. अत्यन्तोपहत is explained by विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 23.1 as 'शारीरैमलेः सुराभिर्मद्यैर्वा यदुपहतं तदत्यन्तोपहतम् ।'.

[^711]: अनाप्रीते मृण्मये भोक्तव्यम् । आप्रीतं चेदभिदग्धे। परिमृष्टं लौहं प्रयतम् निर्लिखितं दारुमयम्। यथागमं यज्ञे। आप.ध. सू. I. 5. 17.9-13. हरदत्त xplainst 'आप्रीतं क्वचित्कार्ये पाकादावुपयुक्तम् ..अग्निहोत्रहवणी दभैरद्भिः प्रक्षालिता सोमपात्राणि मार्जालीये प्रक्षालितानि आज्यपात्राण्युष्णेन वारिणा ।'.

In prescribing the methods of cleaning polluted objects certain matters have to be considered according to a verse ascribed to Baudhāyana[^712] by the Mit. (on Yāj. I. 190) which states: 

> 'One should prescribe means of purification after considering the time, the place, the body (or himself), the thing (to be purified), the purpose for which the thing is to be used, origin (of defilement), the condition (of the thing or person defiled).'

There is some divergence of views about the means of purifying or cleansing certain objects. It is unnecessary to set out in detail these differences. It is proposed to take certain objects one after another and to specify how they were rendered pure according to several of the smṛtis and digests.

Certain foul things were said by the Smṛtyarthasāra p. 70 to be the causes of extreme pollution and certain others as causes of lesser or insignificant pollution. For example, excreta, urine, semen, blood, fat, marrow, liquor and intoxicants were the causes of great pollution; while dogs, village swine, cats, their urine, the wax from the ear, nails, phlegm, discharge from the eyes, perspiration are the causes of insignificant pollution.

### Purification of the ground or soil

Baud. Dh. S, I. 5,66 provides[^713] that the purification of the ground is brought about by means of sweeping with a (fault less) broom, by sprinkling (cow's milk, urine or water), by smearing with cowdung, by scattering (pure clay on it) and by scrubbing away (or scraping) some of the soil, when these are employed according to the situation of the ground and the particular impurity (of which it is to be purified).

[^712]: देशं कालं तथात्मानं द्रव्यं द्रव्यप्रयोजनम् । उपपत्तिमवस्थां च ज्ञात्वा शौचं प्रकल्पयेत्॥ बौधायन q. also by विश्वरूप on या. I. 195 and मेधातिथि on मनु v. 118. बोधायनधर्मसत्र I. 5.55 reads देशं...वस्थां च विज्ञाय शौचं शौचजः कुशलो धर्मेप्सुः समाचरेत।. The verse is लघुहारीत 55 which reads कालं देशं. The मिता. reads तथा मानं which means 'the bulk' (or extent of the thing to be purified ).

[^713]: भूमेस्तु संमार्जनप्रोक्षणोपलेपनावस्तरणोल्लेखनैर्यथास्थानं दोषविशेषात्प्रायत्यम् । बौ. ध. सू. I. 5 66. वसिष्ठ III, 56 is almost the same.


Baud, Dh.S. in another place states:[^714] when firm soil is polluted it is purified by smearing it with cow dung, hollow ground (one having holes) is purified by ploughing, ground wet (with impurity ) by covering it (with pure clay brought from elsewhere ) after removing the impure thing. Land is purified by means of four viz., being trodden under the foot of cows, by digging it up, by burning (firewood or grass thereon), by pouring over it (water, cow's urine or milk &c.) and fifthly, by smearing it (with cowdung) and sixthly, by the lapse of time. Vasiṣṭha III. 57 quotes a verse which mentions five means of purification almost in the same words as those of Baudhāyana (except the sixth viz. time). Manu V. 124 mentions five means of purification, viz, sweeping with a broom, smearing with cowdung, sprinkling, digging (and removing), the stay of cows thereon (for one day and night). Viṣṇu Dh. S. 23.57 adds _dāha_ (burning) to the five of Manu. Yāj. I. 188 mentions seven means of the purification of the ground by adding _dāha_ (burning) and kāla (lapse of time) to the five mentioned by Manu. According to[^715] the Vāmanapurāṇa the ground is purified by digging, burning, sweeping, treading by cows, smearing of cowdung, scrubbing and by sprinkling water. Devala quoted by the Mit. and Aparārka on Yāj. I. 188 gives a more elaborate treatment. According to him polluted ground (_bhūmi_) is of three kinds, viz. _amedhyā_ (impure), _duṣṭā_ (soiled), and _malinā_ (dirty). Where a woman is delivered of a child or dies or is cremated or where a spot has been inhabited by cāṇḍālas or where there are heaps of ordure and the like, ground that is full of foul things in this way is declared to be _amedhyā_[^716]. That ground which is polluted by the contact of dogs, pigs, asses, camels and the like becomes _duṣṭā_ (soiled) and it becomes _malinā_ (dirty) by charcoal, husk, hair, bones or ashes.

[^714]: घनाया भूमेरुपधात उपलेपनम्। सुषिरायाः कर्षणम् । क्लिन्नाया मेध्यमाहृत्य प्रच्छादनम्। चतुर्भिः शुध्यते भूमिर्गोभिराक्रमणात्खननाद् दहनादभिवर्षणात्। पञ्चमाञ्चोपलेपनात्षष्ठात्कालात् । पौ. ध. सू. 1. 6.17-21 quoted and explained by शु. कौ. p. 100.

[^715]: भूमिर्विशुध्यते खातदाहमार्जनगोक्रमैः। लेपादुल्लेखनात्सेकाद्वेश्मसंमार्जनार्चनात् ॥ वामनपुराण 14.68.

[^716]: यत्र प्रसूयते नारी म्रियते दह्यतेपि वा। चण्डालाध्युषितं यत्र यत्र विष्ठादिसंहतिः॥ एवं कश्मलभूयिष्ठा भूरमेध्या प्रकीर्तिता। श्वसूकरखरोष्टादिसंस्पृष्टा दुष्टतां व्रजेत् । अङ्गारतुषकेशास्थिभस्माद्यैर्मलिना भवेत् । मिता. on या. I. 188. अपरार्क reads यत्रारिष्टादिसङ्गतिः in the first verse and धूम for तुष. शु. कौ. p. 101 reads प्रसूते गर्भिणी यत्र म्रियते यत्र मानुषः।...यत्र वा दह्यते शवः॥ विण्मूत्रोपहतं यत्र कुणपो यत्र दृश्यते । एवं कश्मल. The definitions of दुष्टा and मलिना as quoted from देवल by शु.कौ p 101 and शुद्धिप्र. p. 99 are different.

Then Devala[^717] prescribes the purification of the three kinds of ground: 'Purity is of five kinds, viz. digging up; burning (with wood or grass), smearing (with cowdung ), washing (with water) or the fall of rain. Even _amedhyā_ ground may be purified by these five means employed together (where a corpse is cremated or caṇḍālas dwell) or by four (i.e. omitting rainfall or burning in other cases of amedhyā); ground that is duṣṭā is purified by three (digging up, burning and smearing with cowdung) or two (viz. digging up and burning) and _malinā_ ground is purified by one (i.e. by digging up).

### Pollution of temples or idols

The Smṛtyarthasāra (pp. 73–74) provides that if an idol made of iron or other metal is slightly polluted (as defined above) then it can be purified by means of _pañcagavya_ after rubbing it with ashes; similarly a stone idol, when slightly polluted, should be washed with water mixed with the clay from an ant-hill and becomes pure after being treated with _pañcagavya_. Any idol, if polluted with ordure, urine or village mud would become pure after first being flooded for five days with pañcagavya, after being well washed with cow's urine, cowdung and clay from an ant-hill and by being again installed ( with all installation rites). 

Questions about the pollution of temples by the entry of the so-called untouchables or by the entrance of persons other than brāhmaṇas in the inmost shrine (garbhagṛha) have come before the courts e.g. in _Gopala Muppanar v. Dharmakarta Subramania_ 27 Madras Law Journal p. 253 at p. 258, where reference is made to the ceremonies for the removal of pollution according to the _Āgamas_ and _Tantras_. 

In _S. K. Wodeyar V. Ganapati_ (37 Bom. L. R. 584) the point arose whether, when a custom was alleged that in a temple at Banavasi in the Canara district none could enter the inner sanctum except persons belonging to the ten sub-divisions of brāhmaṇas and a Lingayat entered it in spite of the protests of the worshippers in charge of the temple, his entry polluted the temple and whether he was liable to pay for the sum spent over the purification of the temple, the High Court of Bombay held that the custom alleged viz, of excluding from the inner sanctum all that were not brāhmaṇas was proved and that the Lingayat gentleman who entered it in spite of protests was liable to pay damages for the wrongful entry.

In the Nirṇayasindhu (III pūrvārdha pp. 351-52), the Dharmasindhu (III p. 324) and other medieval digests provision is made for the re-consecration (punaḥ-pratiṣṭhā) of an idol in a temple when the idol is polluted by the touch of cāṇḍālas or wine or is burnt by fire or is defiled by the touch of sinners or the blood of a brāhmaṇa[^718]. If the idol be broken in two or more pieces or if it becomes broken (irregularly), if it be burnt or falls from its pedestal or be insulted, is without worship or is touched by an ass or the like animal, or falls on foul ground or is worshipped with the mantras of other gods,-in these ten circumstances Godhood ceases to indwell in the idol. If an idol be touched by robbers, cāṇdālas, _patita_ people, by a dog or a woman in her courses or if it be polluted by the touch of a corpse re-consecration is necessary.

The Viṣṇu-dharmasūtra ( 23. 34) provides that idols when polluted should be purified in the same way in which the substance of which they are made (such as stone or copper &c.) is purified and then they should be re-consecrated. If the worship of an idol already consecrated is stopped for a day, two days, a month, or two months or it is touched by śūdras or a woman in her monthly course, then at a proper time _puṇyāhavācana_ should be performed, an even number of brāhmaṇas should be fed, the idol should be submerged in water for a night and next day bathed with _pañca-gavya_ from a jar full of it to the accompaniment of the respective _mantras_, then another jar should be filled with pure water and therein the nine kinds of precious stones should be cast, the jar should then have the Gāyatri mantra appropriate to the idol repeated over it 1008 or 108 or 28 times and the idol should then be bathed with that water, it should be bathed with pure water to the accompaniment of the Puruṣasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90) and the _mūlamantra_ 1008, or 108 or 28 times. Then flowers should be offered and worship of the idol should be performed and a _naivedya_ of boiled rice and jaggery should be offered.

The passage from पूर्वप्रतिष्ठितस्याबुद्धि to the end is a quotation (with some omissions and additions) from बौधायनगृह्यशेषसूत्र II.19 (Mysore Un, ed.).

Recently after the attainment of Independence some of the Provincial Legislatures in India have passed laws (e.g. Bombay Act 35 of 1947, C. P. and Berar Act 41 of 1947) throwing open all Hindu public temples to people who were once called untouchable. This is not the place to discuss in detail the arguments for and against these measures. 

Many orthodox Hindus hold that their inmost feelings are hurt by this tyranny of the majority in the Legislatures. They feel that these measures are contrary to the four freedoms that are promised in many constitutions viz. freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. These measures are likely to be followed by serious consequences. It is felt that the younger generation now being educated has hardly any faith in religion or in anything being sacred, that the so-called untouchables themselves when once they have asserted their right of entering Hindu temples scarcely ever care to frequent them and the orthodox Hindus also often cease to worship therein. 

There is the further fear that, if religious feelings even when unreasonable according to progressive views could be trampled upon by the views of the majority, there is no knowing where the process would stop. There would be temptation for the majority in a country to say that the sacred places of other religions should either not exist at all or be opened for any one not belonging to the faith of the minorities. It would have been far better that, while removing all the disabilities of the so-called untouchables as to employment, public places, courts and education, temples had been left alone for some years to come. The entrance of one set of people into the temples often entails the departure of another set, as said by P. C. in _Saklat v. Bella_ 28 Bom. L. R. 161, which is not a very desirable thing. The equality of the former untouchables in all secular matters is sure to spread in a generation or so to other non-secular matters and so to entry into temples. 

Adjustments on an unprecedented scale are taking place in modern India with regard to usages cherished for ages and the entry into temples of the so-called untouchables would have been more effected in a few years without recourse to the threat of armed punishments and without bitterness and rancour in the hearts of many people.

### Water as purifier

From very ancient times water has been regarded as a great purifier. Ṛg. VII, 47 and 49 are hymns addressed to waters as divinities and they are there described as themselves pure and as purifying others (as in Ṛg. VII. 49. 2 and 3 'śucayaḥ pāvakāḥ'). Similarly Ṛg. X. 9 and 30 are hymns addressed to waters, in the former of which the waters are invoked to remove whatever sin or wrong one may have committed (Ṛg. X. 9. 8 'idam-āpaḥ pra vahata yat kiñca duritam mayi'). Atharva-veda I. 33 is a hymn addressed to waters, wherein also they are described as _'śucayaḥ pāvakāḥ'_ (in A. V. I. 33.1 and 4). The Vāj. S. VI. 17 ( closely following Ṛg. X. 9. 8) invokes waters to remove whatever is censurable and dirty[^719]. In Vāj S. IV. 2 the sage prays 'May the Waters. Our mothers. purify us !' 720 The Śat. Br. 1. 7. 4.17 (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 213) states' water is a means of purification'. 

Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 191 quotes a long Vedic passage[^721] wherein it is said "whatever creates doubt (whether it is pure or impure) should be touched with waters; then it becomes pure." 

It is therefore that water (hot or cold) is said to be the purifier of various kinds of vessels and of the ground in Yāj. I. 182-183, 188, Manu V. 109, 112, 126. Gobhila (I. 31-32 )[^722] lays down that when a man engaged in any religious rite hears a mantra addressed to the pitṛs, scratches his body, looks at a man of the lowest caste, or allows the wind to escape from his intestines, laughs loudly or speaks an untruth, touches a cat or a mouse, or uses harsh language, has a fit of anger, he should perform _ācamana_ (or touch water).

According to Yaj. I. 187 and Viṣṇu Dh, S. 23.56 a polluted house is purified by being swept and cowdunged. But more stringent rules were laid down if a dog, a śūdra, a _patita_, a _mleccha_ or a caṇḍāla died in a brāhmaṇa's house (vide note 633 above). After keeping the house vacant for the periods stated in note 633, it is provided by Saṁvarta[^723] that a house that is polluted by the existence of a corpse inside it should be dealt with as follows: earthen pots and cooked food should be Cast away and thrown out of the house which should then be smeared with cowdung and then a goat should be made to go about in it smelling it and then the whole house should be sprinkled over with water in which gold and _kuśas_ are put in by brāhmaṇas rendered holy by the repetition of the Gāyatri mantra; then the house becomes pure. Marici prescribes[^724] that if a caṇḍāla (merely) entered a house, it can be purified by plastering it with cowdung, but if he were to stay in it long, purification can be had only by heating it and making flames of fire lick its walls.

The ground in a brāhmaṇa's house, in a temple, in a cowpen should, says Yama, always be regarded as pure (unless it has been polluted).


### Purification of water

A great deal is said in the smṛtis and digests about the purification of water. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 2 says[^725] in a general way that a person after sipping water from what is collected on the ground becomes pure. But the Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 65. Manu V. 128, Yaj. I. 192, Śaṅkha 16. 12-13, Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa 35.19 and others add that water collected on the ground that is of such volume that a cow can slake its thirst therein, that is in its natural state and is not polluted by any thing impure and that has natural colour (is transparent) and taste and odour (either no odour or a fragrant odour) is pure. Śaṅkha says[^726] the same about water collected on a stony surface and adds that the water of a flowing river is always. pure. Devala states[^727] that water brought in clean vessels is pure but when it is (stale owing to its being stored) for one night (or more ) it should be thrown though it was pure (when originally brought).

[^727]: उदधृताश्चापि शुध्यन्ति शुद्धैः पात्रैः समुद्धृताः। एकरात्रोषिता आपस्त्याज्याः शुद्धा अपि स्वयम् ॥ देवल q. by मिता and अपरार्क on या. I. 192.

 There[^728] is no taint in water that cannot be agitated by any beings and in the water of springs (that flow from hills). Tanks (that are so deep) that they cannot be agitated, rivers, wells and lakes (that are similar) should not be used by the usual way of descent (the _ghat_) if they come in contact with caṇḍālas and other impure persons or things. In _Narhari v. Bhimrao_, the Bombay High Court had to deal with the question whether a certain tank at Mahad in the Kolaba District could not be resorted to by untouchables for taking water and held that the untouchables were not prevented from using it (vide 39 Bombay L. R. p. 1295).

Bṛhaspati provides that if in a well the dead body of an animal with five nails (man or beast) is found or if the well is otherwise extremely polluted all the water of the well should be taken out and the rest should be dried up by means of clothes, then if the well be built with burnt bricks flames of fire should be made to lick the surface of the walls), and then _pañcagavya_ should be poured over when fresh water begins to flow in (from the springs )[^729]. 

Āpastamba (q. by Śuddhikaumudi p. 299 ) states the circumstances when a well may be said to be extremely polluted: 'hair, excrements and urine, menstrual discharge, a dead body - when a well is defiled by these one should take a hundred jars of water from it' (and further purification by putting pañcagavya in it should be resorted to if there is more water). Parāśara VII. 3 says the same about wells (with steps ), wells without steps and tanks.

Yāj. I. 197 ( =Viṣṇu Dh, S. 23. 41) provides that mud and water on roads which come in contact with lowest castes (like caṇḍālas), dogs and crows and buildings (like _maṭhas_) constructed with burnt bricks are purified by the wind alone ( blowing on them ).

[^728]: अक्षोभ्यानि तडागानि नदीवापीसरीसि च । चण्डालाद्यशुचिस्पर्शे तीर्थतः परिवर्जयेत् । अक्षोभ्याणामपां नास्ति प्रस्रुतानां च दूषणम् । देवल q. by अपरार्क p. 272. शु. प्र. p 102 (reads कश्मलाशुचियुक्तानि) and explains कश्मलं as शवादि and' अशुचि as विण्मूत्रम्.

The first is quoted as a text of USanas by शु.कौ.p.298 and reads शास्त्रेण (शास्त्रविधिना) for वस्त्रेण. The two verses are विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 23.44-45.

Parāśara VII. 34 states[^730] that mud and water on roads, boats, paths, grass and whatever is constructed with burnt bricks are rendered pure by the wind and the sun.

Rain water after it fell on the ground was supposed to be impure[^731] for ten days. Similarly Yogiyājñavalkya (q. by S. K. p. 291) remarks that water of a river (dried up in summer) coming down in a flood for the first time ( after rains ) should not be taken ( as pure ) and also water that is agitated by some one (with the feet &c.) and waters that start in a separate stream by themselves from a holy river (like the Ganges ). Even when a well (without steps ) or a well (with a flight of steps ) or a reservoir with a dam is constructed by men of the lowest castes, no prāyaścitta is prescribed for bathing therein or for drinking water therefrom[^732].

Viṣṇu Dh. S. 23. 46 provides[^733] that the purification of small reservoirs of water that are static (i,e. from which no streams flow down ) is made in the same way as that of wells ( without steps ), while in the case of large reservoirs no pollution is recognised. It is declared that waters are purified by the rays of the sun and the moon and the contact of the wind and by cowdung and the urine of cows; some of these ideas are supported by modern scientific discoveries.

A verse q. by Aparārka p. 273 provides[^734] that even the water at a _prapā_ (a shed where water is distributed gratis to thirsty travellers ) in a forest or from a jar placed near a well (for drawing water by any body) or the water in ( a stone or wooden) trough (meant for all and sundry ) and water from a leather bag even though these may not belong to a śūdra are unfit for drinking, but one may drink even such water as much as he desires when in distress. This shows that even in ancient times water was carried in leather bags or drums where there was scarcity of water and was allowed to be used even by twice-born people.

This reading would mean that he should pour such water on the ground and when it is as much in volume as cow's thirst he may drink it. The first half occurs in अत्रि 233, आपस्तम्बस्मृति II.2. शु. प्र. . p. 103 quotes शङ्खलिखित to the same effect.

We may now turn to the purification of metals and vessels. Baud, Dh, S, I. 5. 34-35 and I. 6. 37-41,
 III, 58 and 61-63, Manu V. 111-114, Yāj. I. 182 and 190, Viṣṇu 23, 2,7 23-24, Śaṅkha 16. 3-4, Smṛtyarthasāra p. 70 and others lay down rules about the purification of metals which do not agree in details. Therefore it is proposed to set out only what is said by Manu and one or two others. Manu (V. 113 ff.) says 'The wise declare that the purification of metals (like gold), of precious stones (like emerald), of all articles of stone is brought about by ashes, water and clay. Articles of gold that are not smeared with dirty things like leavings of food &c.) become pure by means of water alone; the same holds good of articles that are found in water (coral and shells), that are made of stone and are made of silver on which no craftsmanship (such as drawing lines or figures ) has been expended. Gold and silver sprang forth through the union of water and fire; therefore their purification is brought about best by their causes, viz. water (in case of slight pollution) and fire (in case of extreme pollution). The purification of copper, iron, bell metal, brass, tin and lead should be brought about by salts ( ashes ), acids and water according to circumstances (i.e. pollution caused). Vasiṣṭha (III, 58, 61-63) says: "bell-metal is purified with ashes, gold and silver with water alone and copper with acids.' Yāj. I. 190 says 'the purification of tin. lead and copper is brought about by salt water, acids and ordinary water, of bell-metal and iron by ashes and water,' The Lingapurāṇa (pūrvārdha, 189. 58) says: bell-metal is purified by ashes, iron articles by salt; copper, tin and lead by acids; golden and silver vessels are purified by water and jewels, stones, conches and pearls are purified in the same way as metallic vessels. Vide Vāmanapurāṇa (14.70) which states that copper pots are purified by acids, tin and lead ones by salts, bell-metal by ashes and water.

Medhātithi on Manu V. 114 quotes a verse[^735] which says 'vessels of bell-metal (or brass) when licked (or breathed over) by cows, in which śūdras have taken their food and which have been defiled by dogs and crows are purified by being scoured ten times with ashes (salts).' Śātātapa has a similar verse (vide Par, M. vol. II part 1 p. 172).

Elaborate rules are laid down about the purification of polluted pots and vessels used in ordinary life, in Baud. Dh. S. 1. 5. 34-50, 1. 6. 33-42, Yāj. I. 182-183, Viṣṇu 23. 2-5, Śaṅkha 16. 1-5 and others. There is some variation in all these, but, as the Mit, on Yāj. I. 190 remarks, it is not an absolute rule that copper must be purified by acids alone but if purification is possible by other means, they may be resorted to. It is not necessary to set out the different modes of purifying vessels. A passage from the Śuddhi-prakāśa pp. 117-118 would be sufficient to indicate how this matter of _pātraśuddhi_ (cleansing of polluted vessels) was dealt with in medieval India: "vessels made of gold, silver, conches, shells, stones, precious stones, bell metal, brass, tin, lead are purified by mere water, provided they have no dirt or pollution sticking to them; if these vessels are polluted by the contact of leavings of food &c. they are purified by ashes and water or acids and water according as anyone of these is appropriate; the vessels made of the above substances that are polluted for a long time owing to being used by śūdras or owing to contact with leavings of food should first be scoured with salts (ashes) and water three times and should be then cast into fire so long as it can be borne (without the vessels being broken, melted or burnt up) and then they become pure. Vessels of bell metal when polluted by only dogs, crows, śūdras and leavings of food only once or licked by cows become pure by being scoured ten times with salts and water; but if they are polluted by the above several times then they have to be scoured 21 times for becoming pure. If in a vessel belonging to the three higher warnas à śūdra takes his meal, it becomes pure after being washed four times with salts and being cast in fire and then taken up with hands that are washed clean with water. A vessel of bell-metal that is polluted. once by the leavings of a woman freshly delivered or by intoxicants or liquors becomes pure after being heated in fire; but if it is polluted several times then it becomes pure by being again manufactured. A vessel of bell-metal that is polluted by being frequently used for holding the water expelled from the mouth after rinsing it or the water in which the feet are washed should be buried in the ground for six months, then heated in fire and then it becomes pure (compare Parāśara VII. 24-25); but if it is polluted thus only once it becomes pure after (being buried in the ground) for ten days. All metal vessels polluted for a short time by the bodily dirts such as urine, excrement, semen become pure after being placed for seven nights in cow's urine or in a great river; but if they are polluted as above many times or are polluted by the contact of a corpse, a freshly delivered woman or a woman in her monthly course they become pure after being thrice washed with salts, acids and water and after being heated in fire till they can bear it, but if these are polluted by urine and for a long time and frequently they become pure by being beaten into shape (manufactured) again.

[^735]: गवाघ्रातानि कांस्यानि शूद्रोच्छिष्टानि यानि च। शुध्यन्ति दशभिः क्षारैः श्वकाकोपहतानि च॥ q. by मेधा. on मनु V. 113 and मिता. on या. I. 190. This is लघुशातातप 141. This verse is ascribed to अङ्गिरस् by शु.को. p. 307 and to शातातप by शु.प्र. 116. This occurs in पराशर VII. 23, where the words शूद्रोच्छिष्टानि and श्वकाकोपहतानि are transposed.


### Purification of metallic pots

Viṣṇu ( 23, 2 and 5 ) provides that all metal vessels when extremely polluted ( as stated in note 710 ) are purified by being cast into fire and that vessels of wood or clay when extremely polluted should be given up, but Devala[^736] and others provide that wooden vessels when slightly polluted become pure by being planed or chiselled or by means of clay, cowdung or water and that earthen vessels if not extremely polluted become pure by being baked in fire[^737] ( also Yaj. I. 187). But Vas. III, 59 provides that an earthen vessel if polluted by the contact of wines, urine, excrement, phlegm, tears, pus and blood is not purified even by being burnt in fire[^738].

Special rules are provided for the purification of vessels and implements used in Vedic sacrifices. Baud. Dh, S. (I. 5. 51-52 )[^739] remarks that the _camasa_ vessels used in sacrifices are purified according to the special Vedic texts, since the Veda says that _camasa_ vessels do not incur the fault of being _ucchiṣṭa_ when it is soma liquid that is drunk from them.

 Manu V. 116-117, Yāj. I. 183-185, Viṣṇu Dh. S, 23. 8-11, Śaṅkha 16.6, Parāśara VII. 2-3 and others lay down rules about the purification of sacrificial implements. For example, Manu (V. 116-117 ) provides sacrificial vessels should be first rubbed with the right hand (or with darbhas or strainer) and then _camasas_ and cups are to be washed with water before using them in the sacrifice; the _carusthāli_ (the vessel in which the oblation of boiled rice is prepared), _sruc_ (a wooden vessel used for pouring clarified butter on sacrificial fire), and _sruva_ (wooden ladle of a semicircular shape) are purified by being washed with hot water; the _sphya_ (wooden sword), the winnowing basket, the cart (for bringing the soma plant), wooden mortar and pestle, are purified with water (or sprinkling water according to Yāj. I, 184).

### What is polluted food

Several rules were laid down about the purification of polluted corn and polluted cooked food. A reference has already been made to the purification of heaps of corn. Common sense, convenience and the loss that may be caused by very stringent provisions are the considerations which prompt the rules on this subject. 

Viṣṇu 23.25 provides[^740] that where a heap of rice (or other grain) is polluted, one should throw away only that portion of it which is actually defiled and should submit the rest to pounding and washing with water; cooked food that exceeds in volume one _droṇa_ and that has been defiled does not all become tainted, but that throwing away the defiled portion alone, one should sprinkle over the rest water mixed with gold on which the sacred Gāyatri verse has been repeated and should hold it before a goat to see it and should also bring fire near it. 

Vide Baud. Dh. S. I. 6. 44-48. 

> 'If grains of rice are polluted they should be washed and dried. But if it is a large quantity then sprinkling with water is enough; husked rice (if polluted) should be cast away. The same rule applies to cooked offerings. But in the case of large heaps of cooked food that portion which is polluted by dogs or crows should be cast away and the rest should be sprinkled with the _Anuvāka_ pavamānaḥ suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. I. 4.8).'


Gaut. 17. 9-10 provide[^741] that one should not partake of food that was cooked along with hair and insects (like ants), nor food that is polluted by the contact of a woman in her monthly illness, by a crow or by being struck with the foot (of someone ). But where food is already cooked and then it is smelt by a cow or it is polluted by the falling into it of hair, insects, flies, then Yāj. I. 189 and Parāśara VI. 64-65 provide that in order to purify it water, ashes (with water) or loose earth ( with water) should be cast over it. Ap. Dh. S, I. 5.16. 24-29 provide that one should not partake of food in which hair exists (i. e. it was there from the beginning) or anything else (like nails) that is impure or of food that is touched with an unclean substance or in which an insect that subsists on impure things exists or food which is struck by the feet of any person or in which the excrement or the tail (or limb) of a rat is found.

[^740]: असिद्धस्यान्नस्य यावन्मात्रमुपहतं तन्मात्रं परित्यज्य शेषस्य कण्डनप्रक्षालने कुर्यात्। द्रोणाधिकं सिद्धमन्नमुपहतं न दुष्यति । तस्योपहतमात्रमपास्य गायत्र्याभिमन्त्रितं सुवर्णाम्भः प्रक्षिपेद् बस्तस्य च प्रदर्शयेदृग्नेश्च । विष्णु० 23.11. The शुद्धिको. p. 317 reads 'सूर्यस्य दर्शयेदग्नेश्व'

[^741]: नित्यमभोज्यम् । केशकीटावपन्नम् । रजस्वलाकृष्णशकुनिपदोपहतम् । गौ. 17. 8-10.

The general rule is stated by Manu V. 118 which applies not only to corn and clothes but to many other articles viz. if there is a heap or a large quantity then sprinkling with water (_prokṣaṇa_ ) suffices for purification but if the quantity is small then washing with water is necessary. Manu V. 125 ( = Viṣṇu Dh. S. 23.38) provides that (a small quantity of) cooked food part of which is pecked by birds (whose flesh is eaten by men), which is smelt by a cow, which is struck with the foot (by a man) and over which some one has sneezed or which is polluted by the falling in of hair and insects becomes pure by casting into it loose earth (and water). Parāśara (VI. 71-74) puts the matter[^742] thus: 

> "food licked by dogs and crows or smelt by a cow or ass, if little in quantity, should be thrown away by a brāhmaṇa, but purification should be resorted to if it is a droṇa or āḍhaka in quantity. That portion which is defiled by the saliva of a dog or crow should be thrown away and water in which gold is put should be sprinkled over the remaining portion, then flames of fire should lick the remaining food and brāhmaṇas should loudly recite Vedic hymns (like the Pavamānasūkta) over it and then the food becomes fit for eating".

[^742]: काकश्वानावलीढं तु गवाघ्रातं खरेण वा । स्वल्पमन्नं त्यजेद्विपः शुद्धिर्द्रोणाढके भवेत्॥ अन्नस्योद्धृत्य तन्मात्रं यच्च लालाहतं भवेत् । सुवर्णोदकमभ्युक्ष्य हुताशेनैव तापयेत् । हुताशमेन संस्पृष्टं सुवर्णसलिलेन च। विप्राणां ब्रह्मघोषेण भोज्यं भवति तत्क्षणात् ॥ पराशर VI 71-74, q. by शुद्धिप्रकाश pp. 128-129 (which reads यच्च लालाकृतिर्भवेत्  in the 2nd verse).

The Śuddhiprakāśa explains that the wealthy should not throw away food if it is more than a droṇa in quantity and a poor man if it is more than an āḍhaka[^743].

Manu V.115[^744] says that in the case of all liquids (such as oils, ghee &c.) purification (when they are little in quantity) is brought about by means of two kuśas dipped into them (or by straining them through a piece of cloth into another pot) and if the quantity is large then by sprinkling (water). Śaṅkha provides[^745] that purification is brought about by mere prokṣaṇa in the case of all exudations (Asafoetida &c.), jaggery, salts, gafflower, saffron and in the case of wool and cotton. Vide note 705 above about certain articles being pure the moment they are transferred from the pots of even mlecchas &c.

### Purification of garments

A few words may be said about the purification of different kinds of cloth and garments and the materials of which they are made. Laghu-Āśvalāyana (I. 28-30) provides that a white garment is always commended for wearing (as a _dhoti_), but they are commended for wearing as upper garments and both are not defiled by the touch of anybody. Men may take their food or answer calls of nature while covered with both; _trasara_ is purified by being washed while a silken garment is always pure. Manu V. 120-121, Yāj. I. 186-187 and Viṣṇu (23. 19-22) provide almost in the same words that silken and woollen cloth is cleansed by saline earth (and with water and cow's urine ), Nepalese blankets by the powder of soap berry, clothes made of tree bark with Bilva fruit and linen cloth by (paste of) white mustard. Viṣṇu 23. 6 says[^746] that when a garment is extremely polluted that portion thereof which when washed with water loses its colour should be cut off. Śaṅkha[^747] quoted by Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 182 prescribes that garments are purified by being submitted to hot steam, by washing with water or by cutting off only that portion that is defiled. Parāśara VII. 28 provides that garments made from bamboos and barks of trees, linen and cotton garments, garments of wool and birch bark are purified by mere prokṣaṇa.

[^743]: Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 124 for the measures of capacity called _droṇa_ and _āḍhaka_. According to most writers four _āḍhakas_ are equal to a _droṇa_.

[^744]: द्रवाणां चैव सर्वेषां शुद्धिरुत्पवनं स्मृतम्। प्रोक्षणं संहतानां च दारवाणां च तक्षणम् ॥ मनु V. 115. कुल्लूक explains 'प्रादेशप्रमाणकुशपत्रद्वयाभ्यामुत्पवनेन शुद्धिः '।।, while the शुद्धिप्र. p. 133 remarks उत्पवनं वस्त्रान्तरितपात्रप्रक्षेपेण कीटाद्यपनयनमित्युक्तम्.'

[^745]: निर्यासानां गुडानां च लवणानां तथैव च । कुसुम्भकुङ्कुमानां च ऊर्णाकापर्णसयोस्तथा । प्रोक्षणात्काथिता शुद्धिरित्याह भगवान्यमः ॥ शङ्ख 16. 11-12.

[^746]: अत्यन्तोपहतस्य वस्त्रस्य यत्प्रक्षालितं विरज्येत तच्छिन्द्यात्। विष्णुधर्मसूत्र. 23.6.

[^747]: चेलानामुत्स्वेदनं प्रक्षालनं तन्मात्रच्छेदो वा । शङ्ख q. by विश्वरूप on या I. 182.

The smṛtis speak of purification of many other things, which is of little importance and is passed over here. Only a few illustrations are given here. Manu. V. 119 provides that skins and things made of split bamboos (or canes) are cleaned in the same way as clothes, while vegetables, roots and fruits are purified on the analogy of grain. Manu V. 120-121 state that the purification of conches, horns (of buffaloes and rams) and bones and tusks (of the elephant or boar) is to be caused in the same way as that of linen or with cow's urine or water and that grass, wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled with water. Viṣṇu Dh. S. 23. 15, 16, 23 and Yāj. I. 185 are very similar.

From the above it will be clear that purification of substances depends on many circumstances, viz. whether they are metallic or are earthen, whether they are solid or liquid, whether a polluted substance is small in quantity or is a big heap, whether the pollution is extremne or insignificant and so on.

In Manu the purification of substances follows (V. 110) the means of purifying one's own body. Purification of the body by means of _ācamana_ and _snāna_ (bath) has already been described in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 315-316 and 652-653 (about ācamana). 656-668 (about _snāna_). Purification by bath on āśauca has already been dealt with before. Special rules were prescribed for women guilty of adultery (vide H. of Dh, vol. II.p. 594. vol. III, pp. 647-649), as also for women raped (vide vol. IT p. 575). _Snāna_ (bath) with the clothes on was prescribed for purification of the body when a person touches one who is _patita_ (murderer of a brāhmaṇa &c.), a caṇḍāla, a woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpse or one who has touched a corpse; also when a man follows a funeral procession or touches a dog (vide Gaut. 14. 28-30, Manu V. 85 and 103, Aṅgiras verse 152, Āp Dh. s. I.. 5. 15. 15-16, Yāj. III. 30). Baud. Dh. S. I, 5. 140 provides that on touching one who sells the Veda (teaches it for money), a _yūpa_, a funeral pyre, a _patita_, a dog and a cāṇḍāla one should undergo a bath[^748].

 Parāśara also has a similar verse[^749]. It has already been stated elsewhere (in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 175-176) how the rules about touching untouchables were relaxed when people congregated in a temple or in a religious procession, at marriages and festivals and at holy places. It is said by some that this refers not to the so-called untouchables, but to men who are untouchable owing to āśauca. But this is not correct. The explanation of the Śuddhi-kaumudi and Śuddhiprakāśa given below makes it clear that the untouchables are meant, In the first place, the words are quite general and not restricted. In the second place, there is no untouchability (except for the mother) on the ground of _Jananāśauca_ and it is most unlikely that a person who has incurred mourning on death should visit a temple or go to a marriage or enter a religious procession, or festival. In the third place, looking to the several occasions mentioned together (particularly pilgrimages, battles, fire in a town or village and commotion or invasion of a country) it appears most unlikely that the verse refers only to āśauca on birth and death[^750].

### Reason of emphasis on purification

The ancient and medieval Indians put very great emphasis on purity of mind, of body, of the place where they resided or performed religious rites, of the vessels used by them and of the ingredients of their food and worship. Many of the rules about purification of substances may appear to modern minds as very stringent; but it should not be forgotten that the ancient Indians were imbued with the thought that purity of the mind followed from purity of food (as stated in the Chāndogyopaniṣad VII. 26.2 'āhāraśuddhau sattvaśuddhiḥ' and by Hārita). It would be conceded that some of their rules about purification (such as about large quantities of corn or heaps of cooked food) are based on common sense and convenience. We are probably going to the other extreme in taking our food anywhere and in any surroundings.
