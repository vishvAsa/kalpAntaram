This is merely a list of tirthas from the point of view of Dharmaśāstra and not a treatise on the Ancient Geography of India. The result is that many countries and towns that have no importance or claims as tirthas have been altogether omitted. Bauddha and Jain works on tirthas have only rarely been referred to. Many of the Purānas enumerate the moun tains and rivers of dvipas and var ṣas other than those of Jambudvipa and Bhārata-varsa such as Harivarṣa, Ramyaka varsa, Krauñcadvipa, Sālmalidvipa, but they have been exclud ed from this list. The Brahmapurāņa (chap. 26 verses 8-83) contains a string of over 520 tirthas without hardly any certain indication of their location and the Bhīṣmaparva in chap. 9 mentions about 160 rivers with practically no indication about their location in most cases. Similarly, the Garuda (I. 81. 1-31) enumerates about 200 and Padma (VI. 129) contains 108 tirtha names. In Banaras alone I have listed about 350 sub tirthas. But there are about 1500 shrines and temples in Banaras alone. These have not been included. Each great tirtha has numerous sub-tirthas as in the Varāha-purāna under Mathurā, in Brahma-purāna under Gautami, in Vāyu-purāna under Gayā. Through sheer weariness or inadvertence some of these must have been left out by me and some were left out purposely on account of the absence of any importance. Besides, several tirthas that are regarded as sacred by modern people are not so treated in the Epics or purānas and are not even mentioned in them; many of these have been omitted in this list. Our authorities are often very vague about the location or extent of tirthas. Moreover, a number of tirthas scattered in different parts of India bear the same name (e. g. vide under Agnitirtha, Koțitirtha, Cakratīrtha, Varāhatirtha, Somatirtha). I am under great obligations to Cunningham's *Ancient Geography of India' (ed, of 1872) and to Nundo Lal Dey's 'The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval India' (1927). I have had occasions to differ from both, particularly from the latter. But, the space at my disposal being very limited, I could not enter into even brief discussions

in support of my views. It would look ungrateful to find fault with the work of Dey; but it must be said that he relies too much on rather old and antiquated authorities and has not cast his net over a wide area. Often times he mentions no original authorities (vide, for example, Cakratirtha on p. 43). He is very vague in his references. He hardly ever cites the number of the verse on which he relies and often omits to specify even the part or section of the work relied upon. For example, at p. 13 as regards Avanti he mentions Panini IV. 176, which should be IV. 1. 176. Further, he has omitted several well-known tirthas (e. g. Daśāśvamedhika). He is sometimes wrong in what he says. On p. 54 he states that Kiskindha kānda 43 refers to Devadāruvana as a proper name, but there the context ('lodhrapadmaka-sandesu devadāruvanesu ca' in verse 15) shows that what is meant is 'forests of Deodar trees'). On p. 73 he says Bharatavarṣa was first called Haimavata varsa, but the passage of the Lingapurāņa (I. 49.7) on which he relies (idam haimavatam varsam Bhāratam nāma visrutam) does not bear that out. There is no reference to a prior account here and all that is meant is that Bhāratavarsa is connected with Himavat, as a previous passage (I. 47. 23 Himādrer dakṣiņam varṣam Bharatāya nyavédayat) expressly states that Bhāratávarsa is to the south of Himālaya. In Salya 44.52 Sarasvati is called Haimavati, but that does not mean that Haimavati was the name of Sarasvati in far-off ages. It simply means that it rises in Himayat range.' Only a comparison of the list prepared by me with Dey's work will show the differ ence in details between the two. I should not undertake that task and leave it to scholarly readers.

I have carefully read the two Epics and most of the Purānas. But I do not cite exhaustive references to all the texts where a particular tirtha is mentioned. I feel satisfied with mentioning two or three. Owing to the several restric tions imposed upon myself this list cannot claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But I hope that it is comprehensive enough and far larger and more informative than any list of tirthas presented by any scholar so far. There is ample scope for industrious scholars to improve upon and to add to this lista have included important tirthas from Kashmir and given copious references to the Nilamata-purāņa, the Rāja-tarangiņi and the si Hara-carita-cintāmaņi. I am highly obliged to the Kashmir Report of Dr. Bühler (published as a special number for 187 Cient

by the B BRAS), to Stein's notes in his translation of the Rāja-tarangini and his memoir on the Ancient Geography of Kashmir published separately (and also embodied in the 2nd volume of the translation of Kalhana's work). All the names of tirthas are transliterated into the English alphabet and arranged according to the English mode of spelling. For the Mahābhārata references are given to the oblong Bombay edition and by citing names of parvans, but in the case of the Rāmāyana Roman figures I to VII are employed for the Bāla, Ayodhyā, Aranya, Kiskindhā, Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara kāndas respectively. For the Rāmāyaṇa I have used the edition brought out by the Madras Law Journal Press in 1933. Among Purānas the Anandāśrama editions of the Agni, Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Matsya, Vāyu and Padma have been relied upon and as to the rest of the Mahāpurāņas the Venkate śvara Press editions have been used (except in the case of the Nrasimhapurāņa of which the edition of Messrs. Gopal Narayan & Co. and the Bhāgavatapurāna, of which the Nirnayasagara edition of the bare text have been referred to). The Skandapurāņa has been a source of great trouble and labour. Owing to the limited time at my disposal I have not been able to digest thoroughly the ninety thousand and odd verses of that purāņa, though I have very carefully gone into the Kāśikhanda and some other khandas. Besides, there are two separate recensions of the Skanda and large portions of it appear to be apocryphal and later additions. The seven big sections of the Skanda viz. Maheśvarakhanda, Vaiṣpava, Brāhma, Kāśi, Avantya, Nāgara, Prabhāsa are indicated by Roman figures from I to VII and the sub-sections by Arabic figures. Some of these sub-sections have further sub-divisions into Pūrvārdha and Uttarārdha.

on I have made endeavours to locate the tirthas as far as possible. Inscriptions have been drawn upon in several cases for locating the tirthas and for their antiquities and history. The principal Sanskrit authorities (except Kalhana) are often very vague as compared with even foreign writers like Hiouen Thsang, Alberuni and Abul Fazal. Where I was not myself sure I have given references to the texts alone, and in some cases to the views of Cunningham, Dey, Pargiterband others. If the same name happens to be given to different firth as located at different places, I have indicated the several different places bearing the same name by employing the capital letters

A, B, C and so on. I may state that I have hardly ever remained content by borrowing references to Sanskrit authorities given by my predecessors, but have seen personally each reference to Sanskrit works except where I expressly state from whom I borrow a particular reference. Sorensen's Index of the Mahābhārata and the Vedic Index of Macdonell and Keith have been used in several places. I have also derived material help from the volumes of the Imperial Gazetteer and from the several volunies of the Bombay Gazetteer. The same may be said about Wilson's translation of Visnupurāna (ed. by Hall, 1864-1877), Pargiter's notes to his translation of the Mārkan. deyapurāņa, Dr. B. C. Law's paper on the mountains and rivers of India' in the Journal of the Department of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. 28 and Dr. Hemchandra Raychaud huri's 'Studies in Indian Antiquities' (1932), and the paper on 'Ancient towns and cities in Gujarat and Kathiawad' in I. A. vol. 54. I have consulted only a few Māhātmyas of tirthas. Recently, Prof. V. R. Ramchandra Dikshitar of Madras has published a useful work "The Purāņa Index' (volumes I and II covering over 1400 pages) which collects material from five Purānas only viz. the Bhāgavata, Brahmānda, Matsya, Vāyu and Visnu. The two volumes reach up to the Sanskrit letter 'ma' only. I, for my part, do not agree with much that he says about the age of the Purānas in general and of the five Purānas (which he has digested) in particular, but this is not the place to go into that question. Besides, his work has to be used with some caution. In several places the work is misleading. To take only a fe examples. On p. 547 he lists "Godhūma', makes the remark ‘fit for śrāddha' and cites four references from the Viṣnupurāņa alone. One may prima facie think that Godhūma is here some place fit for śrāddha. As a matter of fact in all the references from the Viṣnupurāņa 'Godhūma' means 'wheat' and nothing more, which no doubt is fit food for śrāddha. But other fit things such as 'ikṣu' (declared to be fit for sraddha by Vāyu 78. -8) are not included at all. On p. 123 A.śokavana is not a proper name, but only a forest of Asoka trees, as the preceding word 'drāksāvana' (in Vāyu 38. 68) indicates. So also Kamala prabhava (not 'prabhavā' as printed on p. 316 of vol. I) is not a river (in Matsya 163. 62, Anandaśrama ed.) but is only a sus adjective of the word Sona that follows. On p. 316 of vol. II Hobb states that the river Pārā rises from Rsyavān, but the Matsya round 114, 24 on which he relies says it springs from Pāriyātra. On the same page he gives the entry "Pārāvāratata sacred to darkar Oriental

Mata'. This makes no sense. Pārāvāratata would mean 'the shore of the sea'. What is really meant is that Devi is styled or worshipped as Pārā on the bank of the Pārā river (Pārā Pārātate mata). He does not compare the readings of the several printed editions of the five pürānas. Besides, the information furnished is very meagre. If the whole had been printed in a compact form far more information could have been given in the same number of pages.

In some places I have indicated the rewards promised for bathing in the tirthas; but I have not done so in every case. The purānas promise one or more of the following rewards viz. the same merit as the performance of Aśvamedha or Vājapeya or other solemn Vedic sacrifices or reaching the highest worlds such as those of Brahmā, Visnu or Siva, the destruction of the gravest sins such as brāhmaṇa murder, the same merit as arises from gifts of a thousand cows &c.

Many of the doubts and difficulties about the identification of several tīrthas can, if at all, be solved only by means of actual journeys to various places and investigations on the spot. That is a task which would require for its proper accom plishment a team of workers. A single individual can hardly attempt such a task with his own resources.

ul This list will, it is hoped, be of some use in elucidating several problems such as the questions about the relative anti quity of the purānas, the dates of several Sanskrit works which mention the tirthas and the questions about borrowing on the part of purāņas among themselves and from the Mahābhārata.

The Vārtikas are "pra-vat satara-kambalavasanānām carne' and 'rnadasabhyam ca'. Meghaduta I. 23-24 show that the capital of the Dasārna country was Vidišā (modern Bhilsā) and the Vetravati (Betwa river) was near it. It is the Dosaron of Ptolemy (p. 71). Br.

(VII.3.1) expressly mentions the river Devikā and the Mbh. thereon gives the illustration 'Dāvikakulah sālayah' (paddy grown on the banks of the Devika is so called). Panini probably mentions some river in the Panjab. Dey p. 55 says that the southern portion of Sarayü is called Devika or Devā. Vām. 84. 12 refers to Devikatirtha brāhmanas, SK. VII Prabhasa-mahatmya, chap. 278. 66 67 speak of Mülasthana (modern Multan) as situated on the Devika : P. I, 25. 9-14 (5 yojanas long and

yojana wide). In Vi. II. 15. 6 the city called Viranagara is said to be situated on the bank of the Devika and as founded by Pulastya. Devika is not Sarayü, as in the Anu. 165. 19 and 21 they two are separ ately named. Br. S. 11. 35 says that a certain malignant Ketu would strike down even Devika in the north. Pargiter (tr. of Mar, p. 292) identified it with the river Deeg or Degh in the Punjab, Dr. V. S. Agtawala with the Vular lake in Kashmir (J.U.P.H. S. vol. 16 pp. 21-22) and Mr. Jagannātha (in J. U.

three miles from Kodinar is sur rounded by the ruins of a temple which popular Hindu belief declares to be the original Dvārakā, where Krsna resided and whence transferred himself to Dvāraka in Okhamandala. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. VIII. (on Kathiawar) pp. 518-520 for Kodinar and p.552 for Mula Dvārakā. It was founded by Krsna (with Rai vataka as a park and Gomanta as a hill) owing to constant invasions and harassment by Jarāsandba; it was two yojanas long and one yojana broad. Vide Sabhāparva 14.49-55. The Var. (149, 7-8) makes it 10 yoja nas long and 5 broad. Vide p. 688 above under Mathurā. B (14. 54-56) says that the Vrsnis and Andhakas left Mathurā through fear of Kālay avana, took counsel with Krsna, ran to Kusasthali and built up Dvārakā: Vi. V. 23. 13-15. B 196. 13-15 say that Krsna begged of the ocean a strip of twelve yojanas, built Dvāraka with large parks, mansions and strong walls and established the people of Mathura there. When Krsna passed away, the city was flooded by the sea and swept away. as stated in a prophetic vein by Mausala-parva 6.23-24 and 7. 41-42. B 210.55 and 212.9. Vide also Vi. V.38.9 (the whole of Dvārakā except Krsna's palace was swept by the sea) and BV IV. 129.44 (except Rukmi. ni's palace). It is called the capital of Anarta (Udyoga 7. 6) and was first called Kusasthali (Sabhā 14. 50). Vide M 69.9=P. V. 23.10, B. 7.29 32 and Ag. 273. 12 (Kusasthali being the earlier name of the capital). The present Dvāraka is near Okha in Kathiawar. The Harivamsa II (Visnu parva) chapters 58 and 98 deal with the founding of Dvārakā. Some an cient Jain works like the Uttaradhy ayanasutra (SBE. vol. 45 p.115) men tion Dvārakā and Raivataka park

(Girnar). The Jatakas also refer to Dvārakā. Vide Dr. B. C. Law's work on 'India as described in early texts of Buddhism and Jainism' pp. 102,239. The Prabhāsakhanda of the SK has a sub-section on Dvāraka in 44 chap ters and over 2000 verses for the glorification of Dvārakā. It says "the reward that is secured by (pilgri mage to) Vārānasi, Kuruksetra and Narmada can be secured at Dvāraka in half a twinkle (4. 52)": "Pilgri mage to Dvarakā is the 4th means of mukti. Man secures mukti by acquiring correct knowledge about Brahman or by dying at Prayaga or by mere bath in Gomati near Krsna" (SK. VII. 4. 4. 97-98). The BV. (Krsnajanmakhanda, Uttarardha chap. 103) has a hyperbolical descrip tion of the creation of Dvaraka, which is said to have been one hundred yojanas in extent. There is a work called Dvāraka-pattalaka compiled by Binābāyi (the only Ms, of which is the one at B.O.R.I. in Poona) which has been published by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri (1940). The Ms. is dated samvat 1574 (1518 A. D). It summarises the Dvāraka māhātmya in SK, A pilgrim on reach ing Dvārakā first worships Ganesa, then Balarama and then Krsna; he visits Rukmini's temple on the 8th, 9th or 14th tithi, then visits Cakra tirtha, then Dvārakā Gangā, then Sankhoddbāra, then tathes in the Gomati. The temple of Dvāraka natha is on the north bank of the Gomati creek. The main temple has five stories, is about 100 feet high from the ground and is sur mounted by a conical spire rising to about 150 feet. Vide D . D. Pusalkar's paper in that DOP) C.

Kāsīkbanda (7. 104-105 ) states: 6 since in this city there are entrance

gates for all the four varnas it was named Dvāravati by the learned. Where even the bones of beings are marked with the sign of the wheel (discus). what wonder is there if the hands of men) are marked 91 with the figures of a conch or

wheel?' In a Dvaraka-mahatmya stated to be taken from the Skanda purana (D. C. Ms. No. 49 of 82–83, copied in sanat 1529 i.e. 1472-73 A. D.) it is stated that Matburā, Kasi and Avanti are easy of access ( sulabha), but Ayodhyā. Māyā and Dvarakā are difficult of approach in the Kali age and in Ms. D. C. No. 63 of 1875-76 it is said at the end that the city is called Dvāravati because it is the way to moksa. It is identified by Yule and others with Barake of the Periplus

describes and glorifies this tirtha, all those verses being quoted in T. C. pp. 176-180. It is said to be the destroyer of sin, equal to Benares, and as having eight sub tirthas and it was so called because in former ages there was one mango tree (B. 34. 6 and 41. 10-93). Vide Hunter's Orissa' vol. I. p. 231-241 and Mitra's 'Antiquties of Orissa' vol. II. pp. 56-98 for history, description, daily services and festivals &c. The chief temple is 160 feet high from the base to the top of the kalasa. In the Bhuvanesvara Inscription (edited by Dr. L. D. Barnett) in E, I, XIIL p. 150 it is stated that Candrika. daughter of the Ganga king Ananga Bhima and widow of Haihaya prince Paramardin, built a temple of Visnu at Ekamra. In that inscrip tion among other matters there is a laudation of Utkala, of the sanctu ary of Ekāmra and of the lake Bindusaras (mentioned in B. 41. 53-54). The date of the inscription is doubtful. But it is between sake 1101-1200. There is a vast number of temples and shrines here. Vide Archaeological survey of India Report for 1902-3 pp. 43-44. Purusottamatattva (Jiv.

IV mention Haridvara and it cannot be said that they both are later than Alberuni (i. e. 1030 A. D.). Probably Gangadvāra was a more popular name in the 11th century than Haridvāra. Al. (vol.

seems to have been Kaśmira. The Mbh (vol. II. p. 119 ) on Pan. III. 2. 114 employs this form (abhijādasi Devadatta Kasmiran gamiyyamah ). Kašmira as the name of a country occurs in the Sindhvadigana. (Pan. IV. 3. 93). In NM the country is called Kasmira in many verses such as 5, 11, 43, 50, but sometimes Kasmira also. Later works also like H. C. 14.45 employ the form Kasmira; the Vik (18. 1 and 18 ) uses the form Kasmira. NM (292-93) derives the name from ka meaning water ( kam vāri Harina yasmād-desad-asmad-apākrtam | Kas mirākhyam tato hyasya nama loke bhavisyati). Ptolemy speaks of it as Kaspeiria and states that the country was situated below the sources of Bidaspes (Vitastā). Sandabal (Can drabhāga) and Adris (Iravati). Vide Ptolemy pp. 108-109 and NM 43. The Vanaparva speaks of the whole country of Kasmira as boly (130. 10). Ain. A. (vol. II p. 354 notes that the whole of Kašmira is regarded as holy ground. Vide also V 82. 90, S. 27. 17, Anu 25. 8.

by the head waters of the Vitastā and to the minor slopes of moun tains that surround it. Hiouen Thsang (Beal's B RW W vol. 1. p. 148) states that 'Kasmīra kingdom is about 7000 li (one li being equal to about 5 miles), that as the country is protected by a dragon it has always assumed superiority among neighbouring people, that they love learning and are well instructed and that (p. 149 ) the country was once a dragon lake and that afterwards it became dry'. The words of Hiouen Thsang refer to an ancient legend according to which Kashmir was originally a lake (called Satisaras) 6 yojanas long and 3 yojanas wide and later became Satidesa (NM 64-66). that Umā herself is the country of Kasmira (NM 31), that the divine Vitastā rising in the Himalayas is like the simanta (line parting the hair) of this holy land (NM 45). The legend runs that Visnu conferred a boon on Vasuki-nāga who prayed to Viṣnu when Garuda began to devour all nāgas that he should stay in the Satidesa along with the other nāgas, that no enemy would kill any nāga (NM 105-107) and that Nila was made king of nāgas in the Satidesa (NM 110). The residence of Nila is the famous fountain near the village of Verrāg in the Shababad pargana. A certain demon called Jalodbhava grew in the Sati lake and killed men (NM 111-123 and Vām. 81. 30-33). Nīla approached the sage Kasyapa the father of all Nāgas, at whose intercession Visnu asked Anantanāga to pierce the hills and make the lake dry and then killed the demon Jalodbhava (R. I. 25). Then Visnu asked the Nāgas to live in peace and harmony with men. Sati became the river Vitastā. Vide Kūrma II. 43. 4. Nāga in Kashmir means the tutelary

d eity presiding over the several holy springs, pools and lakes in which Kasmira abounds. Both NM (1130 31) and R (I. 38 ) state that there is not a spot in Kasmira even as small as a grain of sesamum which is not a tirtha and has not a nāga as its presiding deity. In Ain. A (vol. II. p. 354 ) Abul Fazl notes that there were in his day 45 shrines of Mahadeva, 64 of Viṣnu, 3 of Brahma and 22 of Durgā and that in 700 places there were graven images of snakes which were worshipped and about which wonderful stories were told. R (1.72) and NM (313-314) say that the country of Kasmira is Parvati, that the king thereof should be deemed to be a part of Siva and that none who desires prosperity should disobey (or disre spect) the king. R (I. 42) summarises in one verse the peculiar features of Kašmira viz. 'learning, lofty dwellings, saffron, water containing ice and grapes; these are common here, although rare in

the three worlds'. Kaśyapapada-(under Gaya) Vā. 109,

V. 18. 159-160 (say that Sarasvati was asked to cast the Vadava fire into the sea in the west). This is probably an allusion to volcanic action whereby Sarasvati disappeared. Vām. 3. 8 says that as Sankara guilty of

Brahmabatyā plunged into it, it dis appeared, while elsewhere (e g. in V. 130. 3-4) it is said that it dis appeared through fear of the touch of sudras, Nisadas and Abhiras and Anu.

this. It is possible that when the Sarasvati became dried and only a marshy bed was left it was called Saravati, but that in the times of the Amarakosa, Sarāvati is probably the river Saravati which falls into the sea near Honavar (North Kanara District) on which are the famous Gersappa falls. In the Raghuvamsa (XV.97) Sarāvati is said to have been

the capital of Lava, son of Rāma. Sarayū-(1.) Rg. IV. 30. 18, V. 33. 9,

X. 64. 9 (Sarasvati, Sarayu and Sindhu are mentioned together), In all these places the word is Sarayu, while in classical Sanskrit it is Sarayū or Sarayü (M. 22. 19, Va 45. 94, N II. 75. 71. Raghuvamsa 15.95 and 100). M. 121. 16-17 and Br. II. 18. 70 show that Sarayu springs from the Mānasa lake situ ated at the foot of the Vaidyutagiri. Ayodhyā was situated on the Sarayu (Ram. II. 49. 15). Sarayū rises from Himalaya (Va 45.94, M. 114. 21). According to Pan. VI. 4. 174 (Dandi nāyana-) the water of Sarayū was called Sarava (Kašika says 'Sarayvam bhavam sāravam udakam'). In the Cullavagga (SBE vol. XX p. 302) it is one of the five great rivers of India and in 'Questions of Milinda' (SBE vol. 35 p. 171 ) it is one of ten great rivers, but in both places it is written as Sarabhū. Vide T.P pp. 500, 501 where it is stated that it rises from the left toe of Visnu and is joined by Ghargara. It is the Sarabos of Ptolemy (p.99). It is also

called the Ghogra or Gharghara. Sārdula-a Saivaksetra, according to

It is probable that the Ophir of the Old Testament is Sūrparaka, though some scholars dispute this. A. G.

CONCLUDING REMARKS ON TĪRTHAS

At the end of this long list of tirthas a few words, as promised on p. 722 above, must be said about the attitude that we Indians of the 20th century should adopt towards the moun tains, rivers and other holy places in Bhārata. Modern secular education and the prevailing economic conditions, stresses and trends leave hardly any room for moral and spiritual uplift. We are surrounded on all sides by anxiety, want, misery, hardness of heart and crime. Therefore, the endeavour of all those who have the good of our country at heart must be to cherish all such institutions as terd to lift the mind out of narrowness and to make it concentrate for some time at least on noble thoughts and aspirations and on detachment from the all-engrossing pursuit of money, Pilgrimage is one of such institutions. Those who have faith in pilgrimages as enabling a pilgrim to attain heaven, to collect merit and reach release from samsāra should give pilgrimages a new orientation, should see that their charity is not wasted on indolent, ignor ant and vicious priests, should improve the methods of worship at holy places in such a way as will satisfy all hygienic requirements. The priestly class at holy places should remem ber that in the coming generations they are likely to find their occupation gone, unless they improve themselves, unless they try to be less ignorant and indolent than they are at present and really serve as honest business agents or Travel lers' Guides. The number of people visiting holy places in the belief of accumulating merit is sure to become less and less, as modern secular education spreads. But it would be a calamity for the moral and spiritual greatness of India if pilgrimages to holy mountains and rivers came to be stopped altogether. I would very strongly recommend to all men, however highly educated, the undertaking of pilgrimages to certain hallowed spots. Our country has recently secured independence and it now rests entirely with us to make or mar the character of the teeming millions of this our land. All things that tend to create in Indians the deep feeling that amidst diversities of physical features, food, dress and habits, all of them are-one people, that there is no part or district of this vast land which cannot claim to have made some substantial contribution unity religious and philosophical thought, in abiding literature, in works of art and in holy places, that the destinies of the Indi aiutantal

Concluding remarks on tirthas

of one part of Bhārata are bound up with the destinies of all others. Frequent visits to distant places in Bhārata, mixing up among people of other parts and understanding their peculiar good points, needs and failings is absolutely necessary if we are to keep our freedom. India is thrice blest in the mountain ranges of the Himālaya,which contains the highest peaks in the world and is full of large and life-giving rivers and of numerous shrines associated with the names of the greatest sages and heroes of antiquity. Every Indian who is proud of the great religious and spiritual heritage of our country must make it a point to devote some part of his time to frequenting holy mountains, rivers and other places of pilgrimage. When we see even from a distance the purity, the whiteness and the serenity of the snow-capped peaks of the Himālaya, the play of delicate and exquisite hues and tints of blue, mauve, and pink when the sun begins to shine on them, a sense of wonder, joy and elevation comes upon us. The glorious view of a peak like Kinchinjunga, which is an unforgettable experience, lifts up the whole life of the onlooker to a higher plane for long. Similarly, the sight of the holy Ganges at night or at sunrise in Haridvāra or on the majestic Ghats in Banaras surely empties our minds of meanness and for the moment at least fills our hearts with a sense of nature's beauty and with purity, and brings us in tune with the Infi nite. I may state here that the talk of the conquest of Everest in which some members of European expeditions indulge jars on my ears. This great peak' has so far vanquished (physically) all those who attempted the conquest. But in a figurative sense Everest and other high peaks have been for ages conquer ing the hearts of men. Even the members of these expeditions will admit that Everest and its brethren have drawn men to themselves from all parts of the world, made them give up their usual uneventful and placid activities, have evoked in those who attempt the climbing of these giants unbelievable courage, endurance, resourcefulness and self-abnegation and have been instrumental in exhibiting to the world what un known powers the human spirit possesses. Therefore, these silent but awe-inspiring peaks should be looked upon as teachers of mankind and not as material things to be conquered and dealt with by human beings as they please.
