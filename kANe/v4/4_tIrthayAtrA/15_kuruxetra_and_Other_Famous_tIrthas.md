KURUKSETRA AND SOME OTHER FAMOUS

TIRTHAS

KURUKSETRA (25 miles east of Ambala) is a very sacred tract, the history of which is lost in the mists of anti quity. In the Rgveda X, 33.4 there is a reference to a king Kurusravana, son of Trasadasyu,1538 The Atharva-veda men tions a Kauravya husband (probably a king) who had a talk with his wife.1539 In the times of the Brāhmaṇas Kuruksetra had become a very holy land. The Sat. Br. (IV.1.5.13) narrates the legend that the gods performed a sacrifice in Kuruksetra and at first excluded the two Asvins from any share in it (S. B. E. vol. 26 p.275). The Maitrāyani Samhitā (II. 1. 4., devā vai sattramāsata Kuruksetre) and the Tai. Br. (V.1.1., devā vai sattram-āsata teṣām Kuruksetram vedir-āsit) also say that the Gods performed a satira in Kuruksetra. The idea underlying these passages appears to be this. The Vedic people of the Brāhmana period held yajñas to be the dharma par excellence, as stated in Rg. X. 90.16 (yajñena yajñam-ayajanta devāstāni dharmāni prathamānyāsan). Kuruksetra was the centre of ✓ Vedic culture in the Brāhmana period and sacrifices must have been performed there on a large scale. Hence it was called dharmaksetra and as gods were supposed to have attained their position by what men believed to be dharma (yajña, tapas &c.) it is stated that gods performed sattras in Kuruksetra. The same Brāhmaṇa mentions a Kauravya king Bahlika Prātipiya (XII. 9.3.3, S. B, E. vol. 44 p. 269). The Tai. Br. (1. 8.4.1) informs us that the Kuru-Pañcālas went towards the east in winter (śiśıra) and to the west in summer which was the worst season. The references in the Ait. Br. are far more instructive. The legend about Kavaṣa in which Sarasvati helps the sage has already been referred to above (p. 559 n. 1254). The Ait Br

(8.1 or II 19) calls that place, where Sarasvati came rushing. Parisaraka'. In another place the Ait. Br. tells us that in its time Nyagrodha (Ficus India) was called Nyubja in Kuru A

ksetra.1540 Elsewhere the Ait. Br. speaks of the countries of the Kurus and Pancalas together with the Vasa-Usinaras (38. 3=VIII. 14). The Tai. Ā, narrates 1541 that the gods performed a sattra and Kuruksetra was their altar (for the sattra). The southern side of that Vedi (i. e. Kuruksetra) was Khāndava, the northern side was Türghna, the hinder part was Parīpah, and the country of Maru (desert) was the rubbisn pit. This shows that Khāndava, Türghna and Parinah were border parts of Kuruksetra and the Maru district was somewhat away from Kuruksetra. The Srautasütras of Āśv. XII, 6, Lātyāyana X. 15 ft. and Katyāyana 1542 24.6.5 ff closely follow Tāndya and other Brāhmaṇas and mention several holy places at which parts of the Sārasvata sattras were performed such as Plaksa Prasravana where Sarasvati starts, the Vaitandhava-hrada of Sarasvati, the tract called Parinah in Kuruksetra, Yamunā flowing through the country of Kārapacava and the country of Triplaksāvaharana,

In the Chăndogya Upaniṣad (I. 10.1 ff) occurs the story of Uṣasti Cākrāyaṇa who, when the Kuru country was struck by hailstorms, lived with his very young wife in Ibhyagrāma and went begging for food,

The Nirukta (II. 10) explains that 1543 Devāpi and Santanu mentioned in Rgveda X. 98.5 and 7 were historical persons and were brothers, sons of Rstisena, a king of Kuru. Panini (IV.1. 151 and IV.1.172) explains the formation of the word Kauravya from 'Kuru', the first in the sense of apatya', the second in the sense of 'king. '1544

[Vol.

The Mahābhārata frequently speaks of the high sanctify ing virtues of Kuruksetra. It appears that the territory to the south of Sarasvati and to the north of Drsadvati was included in Kuruksetra and 1545 that those who resided therein were as if residents of paradise. Kuruksetra appears to be called Brahmāvarta in Vanaparva 86.6. According to the Vamanapurana Kurujāngala is 1546 the country between the Sarasvati and Drsadvatī, while Manu (II. 17, 18) defines Brahmāvarta as the country created by God between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drsadvati, states that Brahmarsi deśa which is slightly less (in holiness) than Brahmāvarta comprises Kuruksetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcāla and Sūrasena. From these passages it is clear that Brahmāvarta is the holiest country in Aryāvarta and that Kuruksetra was almost like it; we have seen that in the times of the Brāh manas the most sacred Sarasvati flowed through Kuruksetra and that the place where Sarasvati disappeared in the desert was called Vinaśana and was itself a very holy place. J Origi nally the land called Kuruksetra is said to have been the Vedi (sacrificial altar ) 1547 of Brahmā, then it came to be called Samantapancaka (or syamanta-in some passages) when Parasu rāma made five pools of the blood of ksatriyas in revenge for his father's murder, which were subsequently turned into holy pools of water by the blessings of his pitrs and lastly it came to be called Kurukṣetra when king Kuru, son of Samvaraṇa1548, ploughed the land with a golden plough for seven krosas all round. Kuruksetra is so called after king Kuru. Kuru is said

to have asked of Indra the boon that the territory he ploughed might be 'Dharmakṣetra' (domain of righteousness) and that those who may bathe or die there may reap a rich harvest of merit 1549. The war between Kurus and Pandavas was fought there. It is spoken of as 'Dharmaksetra' in the opening verse of the Bhagavad-gītā. Kurujāngala is said to be a very fit country for sraddha in Vāyu (177.93) and Kūrma II, 20. 33 and 37. 36-37. In the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang speaks of the country, the capital of which was Sthān visvara (modern Thanesar which is the heart of Kuruksetra) as the 'land of religious merit' (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I p. 184).

The extent of Kuruksetra is said to be five yojanas in radius (in Vanaparva and the Vamana Purana) 1550. A some what corrupt verse occurs in the Mahābhārata and some puranas 1551 about the limits of Kuruksetra viz. the territory between Tarantu and Kārantuka and between Macakruka (image of a yakṣa) and the Rama-hradas (pools made by Para surāma)-this is Kuruksetra, Samantapañcaka and the nor thern vedi of Brahmā. The result is that Kuruksetra is referr. ed to under various names viz. Brahmasaras, Rāmahrada, Samantapancaka, Vinaśana, Sannihati (vide T. Pr, p. 463). For the boundaries of Kuruksetra, vide Cunningham's A, S. R. of India, vol. XIV pp. 86-106 where he notes that Kuruksetra was 30 miles to the south of Ambala and 40 miles to the north of Panipat. In the remote past Kuruksetra was the centre of

all the activities and the culture of the Vedic people. Gradually the Vedic people spread towards the east and south and the country between the Ganges and Jumnā and later on Videha (or Mithilā) became the centres of Indian culture.

For reasons of space it is not possible to dwell at length on the greatness and sanctity of Kuruksetra as described in the Mahābhārata and the Purānas. Vanaparva 83 starts by say ing that all beings that are in Kuruksetra are freed from all sins and that he also who always says 'I shall go to Kuru kṣetra, and I shall reside in Kuruksetra' is freed from sins 1552. 'In this world there is no place holier than this. Even the particles of dust driven from Kuruksetra by the wind take a great sinner to the highest goal' 1553. Even the Ganges is com pared to Kuruksetra (vide note 1324 'Kuruksetrasamā Gangā'). The Náradiya avers 1554 that planets, constellations and stars are subject to the danger of falling down (from the sky) in course of time, but in the case of those that die in Kuruksetra there is no falling on the earth again (i. e. they would not be born again).

It is a remarkable fact that though the Vanaparva in chap. 83 enumerates several tirthas on the Sarasvati and in Kuruksetra, they do not at all tally with the tirthas mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas and the Srautasütras (except Vinaśana which is mentioned in Vanaparva 83.11 and probably Saraka which may be identified with Parisaraka of the Ait. Br.). This means that the Vanaparva account of Sarasvati and Kuruksetra is later by some centuries than that in the Srautasūtras. The Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 65 ) names about one hundred tirthas in Kurukse tra. It is not possible to set out all of them, But a few words may be said about some of them. First comes the lake called Brahmagaras or Pavana-hrada (Vanaparva 83. 85, Vāmana 49. 38-41, Nāradiya, uttara 65. 95) on

which Kuru stayed as an ascetic. A. G. (pp. 334-335 ) remarks that the lake is 3546 feet long east to west and 1900 feet wide north to south. The Vāmanapurana (22. 50-55) describes it at some length and says that it was half a yojana in extent. Cakratirtha (mentioned by Vāmanapurāna 42,5, 57. 89 and 81. 3) is popularly supposed to be the place where Krsna took up the discus for attacking Bhisma. Vyāsas thali 1555 (named in Vanaparva 84. 96, Nāradiya, uttarārdha 65. 83 and Padma I. 26. 90-91) is the same as modern Basthali, 17 miles to the south-west of Thanesar where Vyāsa resolved to die on the loss of his son. Asthipura (Padma, Adi. 27. 62) is on the west of Thanesar and south of Aujasa ghāt where the bodies of the warriors killed in the Great Bhārata war were cremated. Cunningham in Archaeological Survey Reports of India vol. II. p. 219 states that Cakratirtha is the same as Asthipura and that in Alberuni's time it was the most famous shrine in Kuruksetra. Prthüdaka on ths Saras vati is very highly spoken of in Vanaparva 83. 142-149. "They say 1556 that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is holier than Kuruksetra, that the sacred spots (on Sarasvati) are holier than the river Sarasvati and that Pșthüdaka is holier than all the other tīrthas on Sarasvati. There is no tīrtha that is better than Prthūdaka'. The Salyaparva1557 remarks that whoever, while intently engaged in repeating holy texts, abandong his life at Prthūdaka on the northern bank of the Sarasvati would not be troubled by death next day (i. e. he would be free from birth and death). The Vamanapurana (39. 20 and 23) calls it Brahma yonitirtha. Prthüdaka is modern Pehova in the Karnal Dist. rict in Panjab, 14 miles to the west of Thanesar. Vide E.I. vol. I. p. 184 for the Pehova inscription from the temple of Garibnath dated in samvat 276 (of the Harsa Era) i. e. 882-883 A.

taxes and tithes for the benefit of some priests and temples, one of which was the temple of Visnu in his Yajnavarāha avatāra built at Prthüdaka.

The Vāmanapurāna (34.3 ff) and Nāradīya (uttarārdha 65. 4-7) enumerate seven forests existing in Kuruksetra as very holy and as destroyers of all sins, viz. Kāmyaka, Aditivana, Vyāsavana, Phalakivana, Süryavana, Madhuvana and Sitā vana. Vide A. S. R. for India, vol. 14 pp. 90-91 for the vanas. In the Salyaparva (chap. 38) it is said that the world is encom passed by seven Sarasvatis, then they are enumerated and their locations are specified viz. Suprabhā (in Puṣkara, where Brahmā engaged in a great sacrifice remembered her, verse 13), Kāñcanāksi (in the Naimisa forest, v. 19), Viśālā (invoked by Gaya in the Gaya country, verses 20-21), Manoramā (in Auddālaka's yajña in Uttarakosala, verses 22-25), Sureṇu (in Rṣabhadvipa in Kuru's yajña, verses 26-27), Oghavati (called by Vasistha in Kuruksetra, verses 27–28), Vimalodā (when Brahmā again performed a yajña in the Himālaya). In the Vāmanapurāna 34, 6-8 seven rivers in connection with Saras. vati are said to be very holy (but nine are actually enumerated) viz, Sarasvati, Vaitarani, Āpagā, Gangā-Mandākini, Madhu sravā, Ambunadi, Kauśiki, Drṣadvati and Hiraṇvati.

Kuruksetra was also called Sannihati or Sannihatyā. Vide those words in the list of tirthas. The Vāmanapurāna (32.3-4) says that Sarasvati springs from a plaksa tree, that after pier cing many hills it enters Dvaitavana. Vāmana (32. 6-22) contains a eulogy of Sarasvati by Markandeya. Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I. p. 261) states that the river Sarasvati falls into the sea at the distance of a bowshot east of Somnath. There is a small but holy stream called Sarasvati, that rises in the Mahikantha hills and after crossing the south-east corner of Palanpur Agency passes by Siddhapura and Patan, flows under ground for some miles and then enters the Runn of Cutch (Bom, G. vol. V. p. 283).1557a

Antiquity of Mathurā

to rest on firm ground. It is stated in the Anguttaranikāya (I. 167, ekam samayam āyasmā Mahākaccano Madhurāyam viharati Gundāvane) and Majjhima (II. 84 same words) that Mahākaccāyana, a famous disciple of Buddha, assiduously preached in Mathurā the principles of his Master, Megas thenes appears to have known Mathurā and its connection with Heracles 1558 (Hari-Krṣṇa ?). The word 'Māthura' (meaning a resident of Mathurā, or born in or coming from Mathurā) occurs in Jaimini's Pūrva-mīmānsā-sūtra 1559 Though Panini's gūtras do not expressly mention Mathura, the latter is included in the Varaṇādi-gana (Pān. IV. 2. 82). Pāṇini is, however, aware of Vāsudeva and Arjuna (IV. 3. 98), the Andhaka and Vrsni clans of Yadavas to which Krsna belonged (IV.1. 114) and probably knew the name Govinda (III. 1. 138 and vārtika 'gavi ca vindeh sanjñāyām"). Mathurā is several times mention ed by the Mahābhāsya of Patañjali who 1560 in a famous passage refers to dramatic representations, paintings and stories which depict the destruction of Kamsa by Vāsudeva. He also cites a quarter of a verse about the killing of Kamsa by Vāsudeva as a well-known past event. Whether the town Saurya mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya on Vārtika 2 on Pāṇini II. 4.7 (sauryam ca Ketavatā ca Saurya-Ketavate) is the same as Mathurā is doubtful, even though the Uttarādhyayanasutra speaks of Mathurā as Sauryapura (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 112). The Adiparva (221. 46) indicates that Mathurā was famed for excellent cows

1558. Vide McCrindle's 'Megasthenes and Arrian' p. 201 where it is said that Heracles was held in special honour by the Saurasenoi tribe (Sürasena) which possessed two large cities, Mathura and Kleisobora (Krsnapura?); while Ptolemy calls it "Modoura of the gods' (vide Mc Crindle's 'Ancient India as described by Ptolemy'. ed. of 1927, p. 124).

in those days. When Hamsa and Dimbhaka, brave command ers of Jarāsandha, drowned themselves in the Jumnā and when Jarāsandha sorrowfully went to Magadha Krsna says 'we shall again joyfully reside in Mathura' (Sabhāparva 14. 41-45). Ultimately Krsna is said to have left Mathurā owing to the constant attacks of Jarāsandha and established the Yādavas in Dvārakā 1561 (Sabhāparva, 14. 49-50 and 67). The Brahma purāna, on the other hand, states that the Vrspis and Andha kas on the advice of Krsna left Mathurā through the fear of Kālayavana. Vide also Vi. V. 23. 8-15. The Vāyu (88. 185) states that Satrughna, the brother of Rāma, killed the demon Lavaṇa, son of Madhu and established Mathurā in Madhuvana while the Rāmāyana (Uttara-kāṇda 70. 6-9) informs us that Satrughna took twelve years to make Mathurā a fine and pros perous city. In the Ghata-jātaka (Hausböll, vol. IV. pp. 79-89 No. 454) Mathurā is called Uttara Madhurā (to distinguish it from Madhurā of the Pandyas in the south) and the story of Kamsa and Vasudeva is narrated, which differs in some material points from the Mahābhārata and the Purānas. In the Raghuvamsa XV.28 it is mentioned as Madhurā and as founded by Satrughna. Hiouen Thsang states that in Mathurā there existed in his day three stūpas built by Aśokarāja, that there were in Mathurā five Deva temples, 20 sanghārāmas (Buddhist convents ) with 2000 Buddhist priests (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I. p. 179). James Allan (in 'Catalogue of the coins of Ancient India' 1936, p.

Inscriptions on Mathurā

689

Inscriptions of such Kuṣāṇa rulers as Kaniska, Huviska and others relating to Mathurā have been published of which the following may be mentioned: Inscription on a Nāga image at Mathurā of 'Mahārāja-rājātirāja Kanikkha' in samvat 8 (E. I. vol. 17. p. 10) 1563; the Mathurā pedestal Inscription of Kaniska in the 14th year (E.I. vol. 19 p. 96); inscription on the pedestal of the image of a seated Bodhisattva at Mathurā in the reign of Huviska in saivat 33 (E. I. vol. 8 pp. 181-182); Inscription of a king Vāsu (rest of the name lost) of the year 74 (E. I. vol. 9 p. 241) and of the time of Sondāsa (E. I. vol. 9 p. 246); seven Brāhmi inscriptions from Mathurā and its vicinity (E. I. vol. 24 pp. 194-210). There is further an interesting inscription recording the dedication of a stone slab in the temple of Nāgendra Dadhikarṇa by Nandibala and other sons of some actor (Sailālaka) brothers of Mathurā (E. I. vol. I. , at p. 390). From the Visnu-purāṇa VI. 8. 31 it follows that an image of Hari had been installed in Mathurā before that purāna was composed. The Vāyupurāṇa 1564 informs us in a prophetic vein that seven Nāga kings will rule over Mathurā, Prayāga, Sāketa and Magadha before the Guptas. Alberuni's India (vol. II, p. 147) states that Māhurā (Mathurā) is crowded with brāhmaṇas.

From the above brief historical sketch it would appear that Mathurā was, five or six centuries before Christ, a flourish ing city where the epic Hinduism prevailed, that later on Buddhism and Jainism dominated it, that there must have been a revival of Hinduism under the Nāga and Gupta emperors, that in the 7th century A. D., when Hiouen Thsang wrote, Hinduism and Buddhism were equally prominent and that in the 11th century A. D. it was completely dominated by the Brahmanio faith.

The Agnipurāṇa furnishes the strange information that Bharata at the command of Rāma killed three crores of the sons of Sailūsa in the city of Mathurā 1565. Mathurā has been

the centre of Kșsna worship and of Bhāgavatism for over two thousand years. The Varāha-purāṇa devotes about one thou sand verses to the greatness of Mathurā and its sub-tirthas (chap. 152-178). The BỊhan-nāradiya, chapters 79-80, Bhāga vata X and Viṣṇu-purāṇa V-VI devote much space to Krsna, Rādhā, Mathurā, Vịndāvana, Govardhana and Krsna's ex ploits there.

For want of space only a few verses about Mathura will be set out here. The Padma (Ādikhanda 29. 46-47) says 'Yamunā gives moksa when united with Mathurā; Yamunā gives rise to great merit in Mathurā and when united to Mathurā it bestows devotion to Visnu'. In the Varāhapurana (152. 8, 11) Visṇu says "There is no place either in the nether regions or on the earth or in mid air as dear to me as Mathurā. Mathurā is a famous ksetra of mine that confers mukti; no place is to me higher than it. It is my birth-place and it is lovely, com mendable and dear to me'. The Padma says "Māthuraka is a name extremely dear to Visṇu'. The Harivamsa contains a fine description of Mathurā, one verse from which may be quoted here 'Mathurā is the hump (i. e. the most eminent spot) of Madhyadeśa, it is simply the abode of the goddess of wealth, it is the horn (i. e. the most prominent part) of the earth, there is nothing like it and it is endowed with abundant wealth and agricultural produce ? 1566

The tract round about Mathurā is said to be 20 yojanas in extent and the city of Mathurā was in its midst 1567. The Varāhapurāna and the Nāradiya (uttarārdha) chapters 79-80 mention numerous tirthas in and about Mathurā. It is not possible to enumerate them here. A few important ones will be noticed briefly. Both Varāha (chap. 153 and 161 6-10) and Nāradiya (uttarardha 79. 10-18) mention twelve forests near Mathurā viz. Madhu, Tāla, Kumuda, Kāmya, Bahula, Bhadra,

Khādira, Mahāvana, Lohajangha, Bilva, Bhāndira and Vrndāvana. There are also 24 upavanas enumerated by Growse on 'Mathurā' (p. 76) which are not mentioned by the Purānas but only by later works. Vịndāvana 1568 was to the north-west of Mathurā on the Yamunā and was five yojanas in extent (Visnupurāṇa V. 6. 28-40, Nāradiya, uttarārdha 80. 6,8 and 77). It was the scene of Krsna's adventures and love-making. The Padma IV. 69.9 speaks of it as a portion of Vaikuntha on the earth. The Matsya (13.38) identifies Rādha in Vrndāvana as Devi Dāksāyanj.1569. In Kālidāsa's day it had great fame. In Raghuvamsa VI, while describing Suṣena of the Nīpa family, king of Śūrasena, Vrndāvana is said to be no less charming than Caitraratha, the park of Kubera (verse 50). Then there is the Govardhana 1570 hill, which Krsna lifted up on his little finger to afford shelter for seven days to the cowherds and their cattle against the heavy rains sent down by Indra (Visnupurāna V. 11. 15–25). It is stated in the Varāhapurāna (164. 1) that Govardhana is about two yojanas from Mathurā to its west. This appears to be tolerably correct as at present it is 18 miles from Vrndāvana. The Kūrma (I. 14. 18) says that the very ancient king Pệthu performed austerities here. The details given in the Hari-vamsa and the Purāṇas are sometimes confused and misleading. For example, in the Harivamsa (Vispuparva 13.3) it is stated that Talavana is to the north of Govardhana on the Yamunā, while it is south-east of Govar dhana. Kālidāsa refers to the caverns of Govardhana (Raghu vaṁsa 6.51). Gokula is the same as Vraja or Mahāvana, where

1569. Dey (p. 42) regards the identity of the modern Vrndāvana which is only 6 miles from Mathura (in the opposite direction to Gokula) with the ancient Vrndāvana described in the Puranas as extremely doubtful on several grounds, the most cogent being that ancient Vrndāvana and Mathurā appear to have been situated on opposite sides of the Yamunā, while modern Vrndavana and Mathura are on the same side of the river. But the references he gives for this last statement viz. Visnupurāna 5. 18. and Bhagavatapurāna X. 39.34 do not in my opinion bear out what he says. The Nāradiya (II. 80. 6-7) appears to say that Vpodāvanaisonen Govardhana and along the Yamunā and Nandigrāma.

Krsna was brought up in his early childhood by Nand-gopa who removed his habitation from Gokula to Vrndāvana out of fear of what Kamsa might do. The great Vaisnavite saint Caitanya visited Vrndāvana (Caitanya-caritāmrta canto 19 and 9th Act of the drama Caitanyacandrodaya, both by Kavikarṇa pūra or Paramānandadāsa). In the 16th century Vịndāvana became a centre of Caitanya's bhakti movement owing to the strenuous efforts and learned writings of the Gosvamins of Vịndāvana, particularly Sanātana, Rūpa and Jiva. Vide Prof. S. K. De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' (1942) pp. 83-122, Vallabhācārya, who was a contemporary of Caitanya founded new Gokula, one mile to the south of Mahāvana in imitation of the ancient Gokula. Caitanya and Vallabhācārya met at Vịndāvana (vide Manilal C. Parekh's work on Vallabhācārya p. 161). The old temples of Mathurā met the same fate at the orders of Aurangzeb as the temples of Banaras 1571

The Sabhāparva (319. 23–25) narrates that Jarasandha threw his mace from Girivraja (Rājgir in Bihar, the ancient capital of Magadha) and it fell in Mathurā at the distance of 99 yojanas before Krsna and the place where it fell was thence called Gadāvasāna. I have not come across this name anywhere else.

Growse describes in chap. IX pp. 222 ff. the temples of Vrndāvana and in chap. XI Govardhana, Barsān, the birth place of Rādhā, and Nandgaon. Vide also 'Picturesque India' by W. S. Caine pp. 253 ff. for Mathurā and neighbouring holy places.

There are four most important tirthas in Orissa, viz. Bhuvaneśvara (or Cakratirtha), Jagannātha (or Sankha-ksetra), Kopārka (or Padma-kṣetra), Yajpura or Jajpur (Gadāksetra). The first two are still held in high esteem, while the last two are altogether neglected.

Among the Puranas, Purushottama-tirtha is extensively dealt with in the Brahma (chap. 41-70, about 1600 verses), in the Brhannāradiya (uttarārdha chap. 52-61, 825 verses ). Among digests, the Tirtha-cintāmaṇi of Vācaspati that devotes nearly one-third of the work to Purusottama-tīrtha (pp. 53 175) and that quotes about 800 verses from the Brahmapurāna on Purusottama, Raghunandana's Purusottama-tattva (which is brief and mostly based on the Brahmapurāṇa) and the Tirthaprakāśa (pp. 561-594) may be mentioned. It is worthy of note that the Kalpataru (composed about 1110-1120 A, D.) does not describe Puruṣottama-tirtha in its Tirthakānda, though it speaks of a few little known tirthas like Lohārgala, Stutasvāmin and Kokāmukha,

Raghunandana in his Puruṣottama-tattva quotes a verse1572 ( which as printed is corrupt ) from the Rgveda that from the context appears to be addressed to some evil spirit (alaksmi) and means 'O evil spirit with a wicked looking chin (or that art difficult to be killed)! Have recourse to that far-off wood in the sea, that has no connection with human beings and go. to distant lands with it'. Then he states that the Atharva veda has a similar verse. Probably following Sāyana's inter

Argo mentions a predecessoire inter pretation of this verse viz. that it is addressed to an evil spirit falakamah and asks it to resort to a boat or a log of wood (as a scapegoat) and to go to a fat

pretation, Raghunandana connects this Rgveda verse with Purusottama, the image of which is made of wood.

It would be proper to set out as briefly as possible the story of Jagannātha contained in the Brahmapurāṇa. In Bharatavarṣa there is a country called Ondra situated on the shores of the southern ocean, which extends northwards from the sea up to Viraja-mandala 1573 (chap. 28. 1-2). In that country there is a holy place, destroyer of sins and bestower of mukti, surrounded on all sides by sand and ten yojanas in extent (chap. 42. 13-14). There is the famous shrine of Puruso ttama in the country of Utkala the whole of which is very holy owing to the favour of the all-pervading Jagannatha (chap. 42. 35-37). Men who reside in Utkala are blessed like gods since Purusottama resides there. Chapters 43 and 44 narrate the story of Indradyumna who ruled at Avanti (Ujjayini) in Mālava (modern Mālvā). He was a very pious, learned and good king who after reading all Vedas, sāstras, epics, purānas and Dharmaśāstras came to the conclusion that Vāsudeva was the highest Deity, started from his capital Ujjayinī with a vast army, servants, priests and artisans and came to the shores of the southern sea, saw the kṣetra of Vasudeva, ten yojanas in breadth and five yojanas in length and encamped there. Formerly there was a Vața tree on the shores of the southern sea near which there was an image of Puruṣottama or 1574 Jagan nātha made of sapphire, which became embedded in sand and was concealed by creepers and plants. King Indradyumna per formed Aśvamedha there, erected a great temple (prāsāda) and was anxious to establish a suitable image of Vasudeva in the temple. In a dream the king saw Vāsudeva who told him to go alone to the shore in the morning and cut the Vața tree grow ing just on the water line with an axe. The king did so in the morning and then two brāhmanas (who were really Visnu and Viśvakarma) appeared, Visnu told the king that his associate (Viśvakarmā) will manufacture the image. Three images of Krsna, Balarāma and Subhadrā were made and given to the king and Visnu further conferred the boon that the pool called

Story of Indradyumna

695

Indradyumna (where the king bathed at the end of his Aśva medha) will be known by the king's name, that whoever took a bath once in it would go to Indraloka, and that whoever offered piṇdas on the bank of the pool would save 21 ancestors of his family. Then the king established the three images in the temple built by him. 1575 The Skandapurāṇa contains a Puruṣottamamāhātmya in a sub-section called Utkala-khanda in its section Vaisnava-khanda, where the story of Indra dyumna is given with some variations.

Stripping this story of the supernatural, it appears probable that the holy place Purusottama was called Nilācala in very ancient times, that Krsna worship was introduced from Northern India at that place, and that three images of wood were established in comparatively early times. It may be stated here that in the Maitrāyaṇi Upaniṣad 1576 an Indradyumna is named among a host of cakravartins. The Kūrmapurāṇa (II. 35.27) makes a brief and colourless reference to Purusottama (tīrtham Nārāyaṇasyānyat-nāmnā tu Puruṣottamam). Rajendralal Mitra (Antiquities of Orissa') surmises that there were three periods in the history of the Purusottama-kṣetra, viz. early Hindu period, the Buddhist period and the Vaispava period (after the 5th century AD. when Buddhism began to wane). He notices that from about the 7th century A. D. consi derable temple records on palm leaves exist, but that the temple records for the Buddhist period are untrustworthy (p. 104) and that there are indications that Puri was probably a place of Buddhist sanctuary (p. 107). The indications of the existence

1575. Vide Hunter's Orissa vol. I. pp. 89-94 for a somewhat differ ent account based on Kapilasamhita, the most important points of which are that Visnu shows to Indradyumna as His image a log of wood thrown up by the ocean, that the images were being fashioned by the divine carpenter, that it was ordered that no one was to see them till they were ready and that in spite of this, the queen insisted on seeing them when they had been chiselled only up to the waist and when only stems stood in the place of the arms for the images of Krsna and Balarama, while the image of Subhadra had no arms at all. The present images are to this day in the same condi tion. The images are described by Rajendralal Mitra in 'Antiquities of Orissa' II. pp. 122-123.

of Buddhism in Orissa are the existence of Asoka's rock edicts on the Dhauli Hill (C. I. I. vol. I. pp. 84-100), the existence of many caves of the Buddhist period on the Khaṇdagiri range about five miles to the west of Bhuvaneśvara, the procession of the car of Jagannātha which resembles the procession of Buddha's Tooth relic as described by Fa Hien (Hunter's Orissa, vol. I. p. 131-132) and the three crude wooden images of Krsna, Subhadrā and Balarāma which are hardly found anywhere else and which correspond to the three peculiarities of Buddhism viz. Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa,' vol. II, pp. 122-126 (where he gives wood-cuts showing the figures of the images and comparing them with Buddhist symbols and Cunningham's 'Ancient Goegraphy of India' pp. 510-511 (the remarks in which appear to me far-fetched). In J.R. A. S. vol. 18 at p. 402 (new series) Sewell thinks that the celebrated image of Jagannātha was originally one of the Triśūlas or developed Taurus symbols.

At present the sacred enclosure of Jagannātha is a square surrounded by a massive stone wall 20 feet high, 652 feet long and 630 feet broad with 120 temples containing various forms of God, 13 being temples of Siva, some more of Pārvati and a temple of the Sun. This clearly shows the catholi city of Jagannatha. Almost every form of Hindu faith is represented here. Even the Brahmapurāṇa gives expression to this tolerant view when it says that the holy Purusottama kṣetra forbids all the wranglings between Saivas and the devotees of Visṇu.1576a The great Pagoda of Jagannātha has four chambers, the first being the Hall of Offerings (bhogar mandira ), the 2nd the pillared hall for music and dance (the nața mandira), the third the audience hall where pilgrims assemble (the Jaganmohana mandira) and the 4th the inner sanctuary.

Temple of Jagannātha

temple is situated at the distance of about seven furlongs from the sea shore and stands on a mound about 20 feet above the level of the surrounding ground, the mound being dignified by being called Nilagiri (the blue hill). There is a large gate-way on each side of the enclosure, that on the east being the most magnificent. On each side of the entrance there is a colossal crouching lion and hence the door-way is called simha-dvāra (lion gate ).

There are certain peculiar features of the great shrine of Jagannātha. In the first place, in the court of Jagannātha and outside the Lion Gate no distinction of caste 1578 is observed. Jagannātha is the god of all people. The second special feature is that the holy rice cooked as offering to Jagannātha is regard ed as so sanctified that all barriers of caste are transcended, so much so that a Parī priest will receive the holy food even from a low caste Hindu. The feeling is that cooked rice when once placed before Jagannātha never ceases to be pure. Hence the Mahāprasāda is dried, is taken to all parts of India and at the periodical srāddhas among Vaisnavas a grain of this holy rice is invariably put on the cake as the most sacred article that can be offered to the Manes (vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa'. vol. II p. 199). The third special feature of Jagannātha is the car festival (rathayātrā) which is the most important of the 24 high 1578a festivals at Puri. The festival is described at length by Hunter in his 'Orissa', vol. I. pp. 131-134. The car festival starts on the 2nd day of the bright half of Āsādha. The car of Jagannātha is about 45 feet in height, 35 feet square and is supported on 16 wheels of 7 feet diameter with 16 spokes and has Garuda as a crest; the 2nd car is that of Subhadrā, which is a little smaller than Jagannātha's car, resting on 12 wheels with 12 spokes in each and having a padma (lotus) as a crest; the 3rd car is that of Balarāma resting on 14 wheels with 14 spokes in each wheel and has Hanümān for crest. The cars are drawn by pilgrims and hired labourers from the temple to

the country-house of Jagannātha (which is about two miles away) amidst the shouts and emotional songs of thousands of pilgrims. Owing to the references in English literature to the car of Jagannātha it is supposed by many that pilgrims used to throw themselves before the car in a religious frenzy and were killed. But there is hardly any truth in these suppositions. There might have been a few accidental deaths. Hunter in ‘Orissa' (vol. I. pp. 133-34) scouts this idea of suicide under the car and Rajendralal observes (in 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. p. 99) 'No Indian divinity has a more unenviable notoriety in English Literature than Jagannātha. It is certain, neverthe less, that human conception has never realized a more innocent and gentle divinity than Jagannātha and the tenets of his votaries are the very reverse of sanguinary or revolting. Never was opprobrium more unjustly cast on an inoffensive object than in this instance and none merited it less'. On the 10th day of the bright half begins the return of the car from the country house.

of According to Rajendralal Mitra the oldest temple in Puri is that of Alābukeśvara built by Lalātendu Kesari (623-677 A. D.), the builder of the tower of Bhuvanesvara; the next oldest is Mārkandeśvara and next comes the great temple of Jagannātha (vol. II. p. 112). Manmohan Chakravarti in his paper on the date of Jagannātha temple in Puri' (J. A. S. B., vol. 67 for 1898, part 1 pp. 328-331) quotes two verses from the Gangavamsa copper plates of Orissa which state that Gange śvara alias Codaganga built the great temple of Purusottama1579. As Codaganga's coronation took place in sake 999 (i. e. 1078 A. D.) according to M. M. Chakravarti, he put forward the view that the prāsāda of Jagannātha was built about 1085-1090 A. D. Dr. D. C. Sirkar (in 'God Purusottama at Puri' J. O. R., Madras vol. 17 pp. 209-215) points out that the celebrated Oriya Chronicle Madalā-pāñji attributes the construction of Purusottama Jagannātha not to Codaganga but to his great grandson Ananga-bhima III, who also installed an image of Purusottama in a temple at Vārāṇasi-Kataka (modern Cuttack)

These Ganga kings built magnificent temples at Bhuvaneśvara (ancient Ekāmra), Konārka and Puri, which are the finest surviving speci mens of North Indian Hindu Architecture. Mitra (‘Antiquities

A few words may be said here about each. The story of Mārkandeya is narrated in Brahmapurāna, chapters 52-56 and in Nrsimha-purāṇa 10.21 ff (briefly). In chap. 56. 72-73 Visnu asks Mārkandeya to build a temple of Siva to the north of Jagannātha and to construct a sacred pool which thence forward was to become known as “Mārkandeya's pool'. The Brahmapurāna provides that the pilgrim should bathe in Markandeya's pool, dip his head thrice, utter a mantra (chap. 57. 3-4), then he should perform tarpana, go to the temple of Siva (called Mārkandeyeśvara ) and worship him with the Mūlamantra 1582 viz. "Om namah Sivāya', then with another mantra called Aghora and a Paurānic mantra. The pilgrim should, after a bath in Mārkandeya's pool and visit to the temple of Siva, repair to the sacred Vața, circum-ambulate it

The Vata is also styled Kalpavrkṣa (Brahma 57. 12, 60.18). The pilgrim should bow to Garuda standing in front of Krspa and then worship Krsna, Sankarsapa and Subhadrā with mantras. The mantras for Sankarṣana are verses 22-23 of Brahmapurāna chap. 57 and that for Subhadrā is chap. 57. 58. 1584 The mantra to be used in the worship of Krsna is either of 12 syllables (om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya) or of eight syllables (om namo Nārāyaṇāya ). Brahmapurāna chap. 57 verses 42-51 specify the various rewards of seeing Krsna with devotion and wind up by promising moksa, 1585 A bath in the sea at Puri is always commendable, but particularly on the Full Moon day (Brahma 60.10). Brahma chap. 62 deals at length with the bath in the sea (the whole of it except one verse being quoted by Tir. C. pp. 126-128). The Indra dyumna pool has been mentioned above (pp. 694-95). The pilgrim has to bathe in the Indradyumna pool, perform tarpana for gods, sages and pitrs and offer pindas to his ancestors (chap. 63. 2-5).

In the Govindapur stone Inscription of the poet Gangādhara (E. I. vol. II. p. 330 ) of śake 1059 i. e. (1137-38 A. D.) there is a clear reference to Purusottama, 1586

The Brahmapurāṇa chap. 66 speaks of the Gundicāyātrā for seven days on the bank of the Indradyumna pool in a mandapa where reside (temporarily ) Krsna, Sankarsana and Subhadrā. The Tir. C. which quotes the whole of that chapter (pp. 157-159), calls it Gundikā, while in the drama Caitanya

candrodaya 1587 it is styled Gundica at the very beginning. It appears that Gundicā is the summer house of Jagannātha about two miles from the great Temple. The word is probably derived from gundi, which means a thick log of wood in Bengali and Uriya (vide Mitra's Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. pp. 138-139 ) and has reference to the legend of a log of wood that Indradyumna found floating in the sea.

It may be noted that religious suicide at Purusottama is referred to in Brahmapurana: 1588 'those who give up their body (life) in Purusottama-kṣetra after mounting up the Vața tree or do so between the Vata and the ocean reach without doubt mokṣa. A man abandoning life, either intentionally or unintentionally, either on his way to Purusottama or in the cemetery or in the country house (of Jagannātha ) or in the streets (of Jagannātha ) or even anywhere else there secures moksa. Therefore men desiring moksa should by all means give up life at that holy place'.

The Brahmapurāna winds up by saying it is thrice 1589 true that that kṣetra (Puruṣottama) is the greatest and highest

The metre requires that the first two syllables in the name of the Yatrā should be us and ar and at may have been easily confused by the copyists of mss. The नारदीय (उ.) chap. 61.40 ff quotes the whole of ब्रह्म chap. 66 but reads गुण्डिचा. The ब्रह्मपुराण reads 'सप्ताहं सरसस्तीरे तव राजन भविष्यति । गुडिवा (गुण्डिचा?) नाम यात्रा मे सर्वकामफलप्रदा॥ ये मां तत्रार्चयिष्यन्ति श्रद्धया मण्डपे स्थितम् । सङ्कर्षणं सुभद्रां च विधिवत्सुसमाहिताः ॥... न तेषां दुर्लभं किञ्चित् फलं यस्य यदीप्सितम् 166.8-9 and 12. Some writers such as Nilambaradasa in his 'Deul-tola' state that Gundicā was the name of Indradyumna's queen (Mahtab's 'History of Orissa' p. 161). I owe this last reference to the kind. ness of Dr. Raghavan of Madras University.

The great Vaisnava saint, Caitanya, settled permanently at Puri in 1515 A. D. at the age of thirty and spent eighteen years there till 1533 (when he died). He appears to have made a great impression on the Gajapati king Pratāparudra deva, ruler of Orissa (1497-1540 A, D.). In the drama Caitanya candrodaya of Kavikarnapūra the king is shown to be so anxious for meeting the saint that he declares that he would die if the gracious glance of the saint did not fall on him.1990 This should be attributed to the inveterate habit of gross exaggera tion rampant in most Sanskrit writers, particularly amongst devotees and followers of great saints. Caitanya came to be worshipped along with Visnu as a deity in Puri and Orissa (vide Hunter's 'Orissa' vol. I. p. 109). Kavikarnapüra in his drama (8th Act) makes Sārvabhauma say that there is no distinction between God Jagannātha and Caitanya, the only difference being that Jagannātha is dārubrahma' (Godhead manifested in a wooden image) and Caitanya is 'narabrahma' (Godhead in human form ).1591 The Caitanyacaritāmpta (a poem ) of Kavikarnapūra in cantos 14-18 deals with the devotional and ecstatic life of Caitanya at Puri and presents a vivid picture of Ratha and other festivals of Jagannātha in which Caitanya took a prominent part. I agree with Dr. S. K. De that there is no satisfactory evidence to show that Pratāparudra was actually converted into the new faith (Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' p. 67).

One regrettable feature of the great temple of Jagannātha is the existence of some obscene and lascivious sculptures that disfigure the walls of the temple and the presence of dancing girls with rolling eyes, to which pointed reference is made by all writers, particularly European ones ( vide, for example, Indian Antiquary vol. I. p. 322, Hunter's Orissa', vol. I pp. 111, 135). The presence of dancing girls is a legacy from the past.

NARMADA Next to the Ganges the most sacred rivers of India are the Narmadā and the Godāvarī. A few words about each of these may be said here.

An express reference to the Narmadā has not so far been traced in the Vedic Literature. The Satapatha Br. (XII. 9.3.1) refers to one Revottaras who was a Pātava Cakra and sthapati (a chief) and whom the Srñjayas expelled (SBE. vol. 44 p. 269) 1593 Revā is another name for Narmadā 1594 and it is possible to say that Reyottaras was named after Revā. A vārtika on Pāṇ. IV. 2. 87 derives the word Mahismat (as the name of a country) from 'Mahisa'. This is generally identified with Māhismati (on the Narmada). So the name Narmadā was probably known to the author of the Vārtikas (about the middle of the 4th century B. C.). The Raghuvamsa VI. 43 speaks of Māhismati as the capital of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā).

The Narmadā is frequently mentioned in the Mahābhārata and some of the Purāṇas. The Matsya (chapters 186-194, 554 verses), Kūrma (Uttarārdha, chapters 40-42 verses 189), Padma Adikhanda (chap. 13-23,739 verses, most of which are the same as in the Matsya) deal with greatness of Narmadā and the tirthas thereon 1594. The Matsya (194.45) and Padma (Adi khapda 21. 44) state that from the place where the Narmadā falls into the sea up to the Amara-kantaka mountain (where it rises) there are ten crores of sacred places, while the Agni purāṇa (113. 2) and Kūrma II. 40. 13 raise the number to 60 crores and 60 thousand.

says (verse 1) that there are 400 principal tirthas on both banks of the Narmadā, but from Amara-kantaka three crores and a half (verses 4 and 27-28). 1595 The Vanaparva (in chap. 188. 103 and chap. 222.24) mentions the Narmadā along with the Godā vari and other rivers of the south. In the same parva (chap. 89. 1-3) it is stated that the holy Narmadā is in the Ānarta country 1596, that it is endowed with priyangu creepers and mango groves, that it has strings of Vānīra fruit, that it flows to the west and that all the holy places in the three worlds come for a bath to the Narmadā. The Matsya and Padma declare 1597 that the Ganges is holy in Kanakhala, the Saras vati in Kuruksetra, but the Narmada is holy everywhere whether in a village or in a forest and that the Narmadā purifies the sinner by its very sight while the waters of the Sarasvati do so by three baths (on three days), of the Yamunā (by baths) in seven days and of the Ganges by a single bath. The Visnu dharmasūtra (85.8) in enumerating a list of tīrthas that are eminently fit for śrāddha includes the banks of the Narmadā throughout the whole length among them. The Narmadā is said 1598 to have started from the body of Rudra which is a poe tic way of saying that it rises from Amarakantaka that is said to be the abode of God Maheśvara and his spouse (Matsya 188.91). The Vāyupurāṇa declares that the holy Narmadā, the best of rivers, is the daughter of the pitrs and the srāddhas offered on it become inexhaustible 1599. The Matsya and Kūrma both say

1595. Though far and her are generally used as synonyms it is found that the traagrius in V. 19. 18 enumerates them separately (aritat

1596. Anarta appears to be the ancient name of Gujarat and Kathiawar together. In the Udyogaparva Dvāraka is called Anarta-nagari :(7.6). As Narmada is said to flow through Anarta it must be supposed that in the times of the Great Epic Anarta included both southern Gujarat and Kathiawar.

that the river Narmadā has a course of complete 100 yojanas and its breadth is two yojanas 1660. Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar seizes upon the length of 100 yojanas and says (on p. 199 note 4 of his edition of Kalpataru on Tirtha in G.O.S.) that the Matsya is very accurate, since the length of the Narmada is now found to be about 800 miles. But he forgets that the breadth is said to be two yojanas (i. e. 16 miles on the scale for a yojana adopted by him). It is not shown how and where (except at the mouth if at all) the Narmada is 16 miles in breadth in its long course. Both Matsya and Kūrma state that the Narmadā is (rises) from Amarakantaka which is to the western side of the country of Kalinga 1601

The Viṣnupurāṇa provides that if a man repeats day and night and whenever he has to go inside a dark place the mantra 'Salutation to Narmadā in the morning! salutation to Narmadā at night! 0 Narmadā! salutation to you; save me from poisonous serpents' 1602 he has no danger from serpents,

It is stated in the Kūrma and the Matsya that a man who commits suicide by entering fire or water or by fasting (on some of the tirthas on the Narmadā or on Amarakanțaka) does not return (to this samsāra).1603

The Narmada is mentioned as Namados by Ptolemy (p. 102). One of the earliest inscriptional references to it occurs in the Eran stone pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in 165 of Gupta era i. e. 484-85 A. D. Vide C. I. I. vol. III, at p. 89.

Several rivers are mentioned as falling into the Narmada such as Kapilā (on the south bank, Matsya 186. 40, Padma I. 13. 35), Visalya (Matsya 186.46 = Padma II. 13. 35-39), Erandi (Matsya 191.42-43, Padma I. 18. 44), Iksu-nādi (Matsya 191. 49, Padma I. 18. 47), Kaveri (Matsya 189. 12-13,1604 Padma I. 16. 6).

Many sub-tirthas are enumerated, out of which two or three may be mentioned here. One is Maheśvara-tirtha (i. e. Omkara) from where Rudra is said to have burnt down with an arrow the three cities of Bāṇāsura (Matsya 188.2 ft, Padma I. 15.2 ff), Sukla-tirtha (highly praised in Matsya 192.3 ff about which it is said that the rājar ṣi Canakya 1605 attained perfection there), Bhrgutirtha (at the very 1606 sight of which a man becomes free from sin, a bath in which leads to heaven and death at which ensures non-return to saṁsāra ), the Jāmadagnya-tirtha (where the Narmadā 1607 falls into the sea and where Lord Janārdana secured perfection). The mountain Amarakantaka is a tirtha that dispels all sins including brāhmana-murder and it is one yojana all round in extent (Matsya 189. 89, 98). The most important place on the Narmadā is, however, Māhismati, about the exact location of which scholars have differed. The general consensus of opinion is that Māhismati is to be identified with Omkāra Māndhātā, an island in the Narmadā about 40 miles south of Indore. It has a long history. Moggaliputta Tissa is said in Buddhist works to have sent missionaries to several countries in the reign of Asoka (about 247 B. C.), one of which was sent to Mahiṣamandala. Dr. Fleet in his paper Mahiga mandala and Māhismati' (in J.R. A, S, for 1910 pp. 425-447) assigns cogent reasons for identifying Mahigamandala and Māhismati. Māhismati was well-known to the Mahābhasya, 1608 from a passage in which it follows that by a forced march a person starting from Ujjayini could reach Māhismati the next morning. Kālidāsa describes it as surrounded by Revā (Raghuvamsa VI. 43). Māhismati is mentioned as being on

GODAVARĪ

No mention of Godavari has so far been found in the Vedic Literature. In Buddhist works there are traditions about Bāvarī, who was a purohita of Mahākosala and then of Pasenadi, who resided in Assaka's territory in the vicinity of Alaka on the Godāvari and who is said to have sent several disciples to Buddha at Srāvasti (vide Suttanipāta, S. B. E. vol. X part 2 pp. 184 and 187). The Vārtika 'Sankhyāyā nadi-godāvari bhyām ca' on Pān. V. 4.75, expressly mentions Godāvari and has in view 'Saptagodāvara'. The two Epics and Purānas contain numerous references to it. The Vanaparva 1609 mentions it as a holy river in the south, abounding in gardens and full of water and resorted to by hermits performing austerities. The Aranyakānda of the Rāmāyana (13.13 and 21) speaks of the country well-known as 'Pañcavati' frequented by herds of deer which is near the Godavari and about two yojanas from Agas tya's hermitage. It is in the Brahmapurāṇa that the Godāvari and the subsidiary tirthas on it have been lauded at great length in chapters 70-175. The Tirthasāra (a part of Nộsimha prasāda) quotes about 60 verses from chapters 89, 91, 106, 107, 116-118, 121, 122, 128, 131, 144, 154, 159, 172 of the Brahma purāna, which fact shows that the chapters on Gautamī in the present Brahmapurāna were part of the Brahmapurāna at least some centuries before 1500 A.D. Vide my paper in J.B.B.R.A.S. for 1917 p. 27-28. The Brahmapurāna generally refers to the Godāvarī as Gautami. 1610 It is stated by the Brahmapurāna that the Ganges to the south of the Vindhya mountain is called Gautami and to its north Bhāgirathi. The Godavari is said to be 200 yojanas long and there are three crores and a half of

tirthas on it. 1611 Dandakāranya is said to be the seed ( source or cause ) of dharma and mukti and the country embraced by the Gautami is specially the holiest. 1612 A verse occurring in several purāṇas states 'These countries (of Madhyadeśa) are immediately next to the mountain Sahya: thereon is Godāvari and that country is the most charming in the whole world. There is Govardhana there which is (like) Mandara and Gandhamādana’. 1613 Brahmapurāna (chapters 74-76) narrates how Gautama brought the Ganges from the matted hair of Siva to Brahmagiri where he had his hermitage and how Ganesa helped in the task by means of a ruse. The Nāradapurana (uttarārdha 72) narrates that no rain fell for 12 years while Gautama practised tapas, that owing to famine all sages came to Gautama's hermitage, that he brought Gangā to his hermi tage, that he sowed sāli grains in the morning and reaped the crop by midday, that this went on till there was plenty of rain and crops, that Siva appeared to him, that Gautama prayed that Siva should stay near his hermitage and that hence the hill on which Gautama had his hermitage came to be called Tryambaka (verse 24). Varāha (171. 37-44) also says that Gautama brought Jahnavi to Dandaka and the river became Godāvari. The Kūrma (II. 20. 29-35) mentions a long list of rivers and other sacred places and winds up by saying that the Godāvarī is pre-eminently a place for performing srāddha. It is stated in the Brahmapurāṇa that for the removal of all kinds of distress two alone are declared (as the means) viz. the holy river Gautami or Siva who is full of compassion. 1614 The Brahmapurāna describes about a hundred tirthas on the Godāvari, such as Tryambaka (79.6), Kuśāvarta (80, 1-3), Janasthāna ( 88.1), Govardhana (chap. 91), Pravarāsangama

(106) and Nivāsapura 1615 (106.55), Vañjarāsangama (159) but they have to be passed over from considerations of space. A few words must, however, be said about Nasik, Govardhana, Pañcavati and Janasthāna. Nasik must have existed at least 200 years before Christ. An Inscription on one pillar of the railing at Bharhut stūpa (about 200 B.C.) records the gift of Goraksitā of Nasik, the wife of Vasuka. 1616 This is the earliest certain historical reference to Nasik discovered so far. The Mahābhāsya 1617 speaks of Nasikya as a city. The Vāyu purāna (45.130) mentions Nāsikya as a country. The Nasik Inscriptions in the Pandulenā caves (Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 pp. 544-639 and E. I. vol. VIII pp. 59-96 edited by Senart) establish that Nasik was a prosperous place in the centuries before and after Christ. Ptolery (about 150 A. D.) mentions Nasika (Ptolemy p. 156). It is not possible for rea sons of space to go into the detailed history of Nasik, its bath ing places and pools, its temples, pilgrimages and rites of worship. For these one may consult the Bombay Gazetteer, vol.

16 (for Nasik District). That volume states that there are about 60 temples in Nasik (pp. 503-512) and 16 in Pancavati and one the left bank of the Godāvari (pp. 512 ff.). But hardly any really old temple has survived. In 1680 A. D. twenty-five temples at Nasik were destroyed by the Deccan Viceroy of Aurangzeb. Almost all the large temples that adorn Nasik were built during the tinies of the Peshwas of Poona (1750 1818). Three temples are specially worthy of mention, viz. the the Rāmji temple in Pañcavati and Nāro Shankar's temple (or Bell temple) on the left bank of the Godāvarī near the first crossing and that of Sundara-nārāyana in Aditwar Peth at Nasik (p. 503).

place is a much frequented place. Not far from the Sitā-gumphā is the temple of Kālā Rāma, one of the finest modern temples in Western India. There are numerous bathing places and sacred pools (kundas) between Govardhana (6 miles to the west of Nasik) and Tapovana (11 miles to south-east of Nasik). Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 pp. 522-526. The holiest spot in Nasik is the Rāmakunda near the left bank of the Godavari where it takes its first bend to the south. For the Kālārama daily services and the rites pilgrims have to perform at Nasik, vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 pp. 517-518 and 529-531 respectively. Rāmanavami is one of the great religious festivals at Nasik.

Govardhana town occurs several times in the long and famous Nasik Inscription of Uṣavadāta (No. 10 in Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 p. 569-70). 1618 As regards Pañcavați the place still goes by the same name. It is to be noted that in the Rāmāyana III. 13.13 Pañcavati is styled a desa (country). Janasthāna was in Dandakāraṇya according to the Salyaparva 39. 9-10, Rām. III. 21. 19-20, Nāradiya-purāna II. 75. 30 and Agni 7.2–3 1619 and Pañcavati was part of Janasthāna. Jana - sthāna is said to be four yojanas in extent, and it is further stated that it was so called because kings of the Janaka line secured mukti there through the favour of the Godavari, 1620

meritorious, 1621 The Brahmapurana says that three crores and a half of tirthas that exist in the three worlds come for a bath in the Gangā when Jupiter is in Leo and that bathing in the Bhāgirathi ( every day ) for sixty thousand years ( is equal) to bathing only once in the Godavari when Jupiter is in the Zodical sign Leo. 1622 It is stated in the Varāhapurāna that when a man repairs to the sacred Godāvari in simhastha year, takes a bath and offers tarpana (and śrāddha) to his pitrs the latter go to heaven if they are in hell and they attain final release if they are already denizens of heaven, Jupiter is in Leo for one year once in twelve years. Crowds of pilgrims throng at Nasik in their thousands from all parts of India in the simhastha year.

KANCĪ (modern Conjeeveram ). Kāñci is one of the seven holy cities of India (vide p. 678 n. 1535 above ) and one of the most ancient towns in southern India. If we rely on the tradition recorded by Hiouen Thsang who stayed in Kāñci about 640 A. D. it would follow that Buddha frequented the region around Kāñcīpura and that Kañci had a stūpa about 100 feet high built by Asokaraja (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II, p. 230). Hiouen Thsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li (or about 5 miles ) in circuit, that in his day there were eighty Deva temples and that there were many heretics called Nirgranthas (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II, pp. 228-229 ). The next important daturn is the mention of Kāñci-puraka (resident of Kancipura) in the Mahābhāsya on Vārtika 26 to Pān. IV. 2. 104 (Kielhorn, vol. II. p. 298). Several early records relating to the ancient history of the Pallavas of Kāñci (of about 250 to 350 A. D.) have been published, such as the Mavidavolu plates of Yuvamahārāja Siva-skandavarman (E.I. yol. VI p. 84), the Hirahadagalli Inscription of the 8th year (E.

Allahabad Prasasti of Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions ed. by Fleet p. 7) states that Samudragupta vanquished Viṣnugopa, king of Kāñci (Kāñceyaka), in the first half of the 4th century A. D. In the 'Manimekhalai' there is an elaborate description of the town of Kāñci where Manimekhalai ultimately attained to enlightenment (vide S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar's 'Mani mekhalai in its historical setting' p. 20). It is not necessary for the present purpose to refer to the numerous inscriptions about the Pallavas and Kāñci and the large number of papers contributed to learned Journals. Reference may, however, be made to the careful and scholarly work "History of the Pallavas of Kāñci' by R. Gopalan (1928), which brings together all relevant data published up to the date of its composition,

Let us now turn to some passages from the Purāṇas about Kāñcī. The Brahmānda asserts : 1623 The two cities of Kasi and Kāñci are the two eyes of Lord Siva; Kāñci is a famous Vaisnava kṣetra but it also brings about the presence of Siva'. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya-sutra (III. 124) that Kāñci is a Sākta-kṣetra and in the Devibhāgavata (VII. 38. 8) it is said to be a Devīsthāna called Annapurna. The Vāmana-purana 1624 observes: the Jāti is the best among flowers, Kāñcī the best among towns, Rambhā among women, the householder among persons of (the four) asramas, Kusasthali is the best among cities and Madhyadesa among all countries,

Kāñci is full of temples and shrines. The most famous are the Vaikuntha Perumal temple of Visnu and the Saiva temple of Kailasanatha built by Pallava Rājasimha. This latter has a large hall supposed to contain 1000 columns 1625 There is an old Jaina temple also.

every year. The Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20 (for Sholapur District) devotes pp. 415-482 to Pandharpur. This sacred place cannot claim very great antiquity. On the materials so far available it is difficult to decide when the shrine of Vithobā was established, but there is sufficient evidence to enable one to say that it was certainly in existence in the middle of the thirteenth century A. D.1626 The Padmapurāṇa (Uttara-khanda 176. 56-58 ) mentions the image of Vitthala Visnu on the bank of the Bhimarathi which has only two arms and is called Bindu-madhava. The difficulty is about the date of this part of the Padmapurana. In my opinion it is a late addition and cannot be placed earlier than about 1000 A.D. The modern town of Pandharpur lies along the right bank of the Bhima river. The chief temple in Pandharpur is that of Vithoba in the centre of that part of the town which is considered holy. The Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20 describes at some length (pp. 417-424) the main temple of Vithobā and its adjoining parts. Behind the temple of Vithobā is the temple of Rakhumai, the consort of Vithobā. There is a large staff of priests and attendants in the temple of Vithobā, the chief of whom are those called Badves (who are the most numerous body of the staff and who once claimed to be owners of the temple, but who are now held to be the trustees and guardians of the temple pro perty and of the god's jewels under a scheme of management framed by the High Court of Bombay).1627 Except the Badves all

In Sakharam Bhimaji Benare and others versus Gangaram Babaji Badve and others, Printed Judgments of the Bombay High Court for 1896 p. 644, the position set out above was accepted by both sides and a scheme of management was framed by the High Court (pp. 649-651) which provided for the creation of a Vithobā Fund, for the appointment of a committee of management con sisting of five Badves to be elected every year, for the keeping of accounts by the Badves, and for the auditing of these accounts by a Devasthan.com - mittee and declared that any cash offering exceeding Rs. 500 was not to be appropriated by the Badves for their own use, but was to expended for ornaments for the image and to be added to the Vithobe fand, if not so required.

other attendants are called sevādhāris and they are of various grades, viz. the pujāris (who take the principal part in the worship of the God), Benaris 1628 (who repeat mantras and hymns at different services), paricārakas (who bring in a large silver dish the water with which the pujāri washes the image of the God and brings the lamp for waving it before the image at the evening and night services), haridās (who sings generally five verses in honour of the god at the morning, evening and night services), the dingres (who hold a mirror before the God at the early morning service after the god has been dressed and before the lights are waved), the divtes (the torch-bearers) who hold a lighted torch when the last night ceremonies are over and carry the slippers of the god in torch-light processions three times a year on the Full Moon days of Āsādha and Kārtika and on the Dasrā night), the dange (who stands with a silver or gold plated mace outside the ante-chamber at the morning, evening and night services). The goddess Rakhumāi has only one set of priests known as Utpāts, of whom there are over a hundred families.

The Bombay Gazetteer describes at length (pp. 427-430) the ordinary and special services in the temple of Vithobā which are passed over here. Their essence is that the god is treated as if he were some high human person requiring bath, dress, songs, sleep against fatigue and so on. One thing, how ever, may be noticed that no women singers or dancers are connected with this temple of Vithobā in contradistinction to many temples in the Deccan and South India.

The image of Vitthal or Vithobā in the temple is about three feet and nine inches high and together with its base seems to be cut out of one block of trap. Its rough appearance is probably due to the effect of time. The image is standing with its arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips; the left

Vithoba Image at Pandharpur

715

Kantak, the writer of the note on Pandharpur in the Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20, remarks (p. 424): "The dress and ornament of the image belong to a (time) little later than the Guptas, probably not later than the 5th or 6th century after Christ. As far as is known no other existing Vaisnava temple in India has an image of Visnu like the Pandharpur image, but there are two similar images of the third century after Christ in the Udayagiri brahmanical caves near Bhilsā ...... Like the Pan dharpur image these are both standing figures with arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips and a conch and discus in the hands". Formerly pilgrims used to embrace the image and also touched the feet of the image. But since about 1873 the feet alone are allowed to be touched.

The Bombay Gazetteer (vol. 20 p. 431, note 2) states that the image of Vithobā was removed to various places at diffe rent times to save it from sacrilege by fanatic Moslem invaderg and rulers. About 500 yards east of Vithobā's temple in the bed of the Bhīmā river is the temple of Pundlik, one of the most favourite places of Worship in Pandharpur. This last temple is not that of a god. It oply marks the spot where Pundlik, a great devotee of Vitthal, spent his last days and died. Pundlik was probably a brāhmaṇa from Pandharpur, originally an undutiful son who ill-treated his parents, but who later repented on seeing the dutiful cobbler Rohidās, changed his ways and became a very dutiful son, so much so that tradition says that god Vithobā came to visit him. Vithoba and Pundlik have become so much coupled together that all pilgrims before beginning to dine and on other occasions shout the cry

Pundalika varade Hari Vitthal' 1629. The Bom. G. vol. 20 (pp. 432-434) describes the temple of Pundlik and narrates the traditional story about him.

1629. The writer in Bom. G. vol. 20 translates the words tuertehara Eit fag as 'O! Pundalika, grant us a boon, Hari Vithal!'. This translation does not appear to me to be correct. The cry is also in the form 'guenta atet e raga: (which is the correct one). In my opinion art fagy is only a vocative and the correct form is qu a ter (for ware) and the whole cry means 'O Hari Vithall that didst grant a boon to Pundalika'. Mr. A. K 'Priyolkar kindly pointed out to me an abhanga from श्री ज्ञानेश्वरमहाराजांची TOTT (ed by Sri Vināvakbuwā Sakhare. 1927) which runs as follows TCAT

Pages 434-468 of Bom. G. vol. 20 describe the several temples and shrines at Pandharpur such as those of Visnupada, Trimbakeśvara, Candrabhāgā, Janābai's cell, which are all passed over here. The river Bhimā is styled Candrabhāgā within Pandharpur limits and its water is believed to possess sin-purifying power.

Several important and controversial questions arise in relation to Vithobā's temple at Pandharpur; viz, the date when the image of Vithobā was installed in the temple at Pandharpur, whether the present image is an old one or a substitute, what the ancient name of Pandharpur was, the derivation of the word 'Vitthal'. As regards the first question it may be stated that there is not enough evidence to establish with certainty the time when the image was established 1630 But some of the items of evidence may be briefly set out here. In I. A. vol. 14 pp. 68-75 Prof. K. B. Pathak published an inscription on a copper plate found at Bendigere (about eleven miles south-east from Belgaum), the inscription being dated in sake 1171 (1249 A. D.), in which Pandharpur is called Pauṇdarikakṣetra on the Bhima rathi (at p. 74) and Vithobā is called Viṣṇu and which records the grant of a village in Venugrāma district (Belgaum) to a number of brāhmanas by a minister of Yadava king Krsna (or Kanhara in the inscription) in the presence of god Visnu (p. 74) i.e. before the image of Visnu or Vitthala. Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar in Vaisnavism, Saivism &c.'. (p. 88) and in History of the Deccan' (2nd ed. p. 115-6) refers to an inscription on stone dated sake 1192 (1270 A. D.) in Pandharpur itself, in which Bhānu, son of Keśava, is represented as having performed the Aptoryāma sacrifice in Pandurangapura 'on account of which crowds and Vitthala were greatly pleased'. There is another earlier inscription in the temple of Vithobā on three sides of a stone beam in a sopā beyond the mandapa (porch) of 16 pillars, the script being Devanagari and the language being partly Sanskrit and partly Canarese. It was issued in sake 1159 (1237 A, D.) by Hoysala king Someśvara and records the grant of an agrahāra to God Vitthaladeva who resides in a great village called Pandarage situated on the Bhimarathi river and who

made the heart of sage (muni) Pundarika expand (with devotion). Vide Bom. G. vol. 20 pp. 419-420 and pp. 4-6 of Mr. Khare's monograph (on medieval references). The Mysore Archaeo logical Survey Report for 1929 (pp. 197-210) publishes a copper plate inscription issued by the Rāstrakūta king Avidheya which records a grant of Pandaranga-palli and four other villages situated to the east of Mahādeva hill to a brāhmana named Jayad-vittha. This grant was confirmed about 820 A. D. by Rāstrakūta king Sarvarasa (i. e. Amoghavarṣa I). The editor Dr. Krishna is of opinion that the date of the inscription must be 516 A. D. (ibid. p. 203). Therefore the important con clusion follows that Pandharpur was known to Canarese people as Pandarage and was also called Pandarangapalli. This in scription does not expressly refer to god Vitthala, but the donee's name Jayad-vittha contains the part Vittha which is most probably an early form of Vitthala.

In a work called 'Vitthalabhusana' 1631 by one Gopalacārya about eleven verses are quoted from Hemādri on Tirtha which are quoted below 1632. Briefly they state : an excellent tirtha ex

ists on the southern bank of the river Bhaimi and there is also a rare but fine image there; it is called Paundarika kṣetra and the greatest of gods viz. Pānduranga worshipped by the whole kṣetra resides there. It is three times holier than Puskara, six and ten times holier than Kedara and Vārānasi respectively. Pundarika practised severe austerities at the end of Dvāparayuga in the 28th Kalpa and always devotedly attended upon his parents. God Krsna who was making a herd of cows graze on Govardhana hill became pleased with him for his devotion to his parents, Krsna who wields a stick for driving cows, who has bracelets rendered bright by (the colour) of the umbrella 1633 ( shade), who is adorned with a head-gear (mukuta) and a śikya ( a loop ) scintilating with the lustre of many jewels, who was very charming and had armlets studded with jewels, who does not (appear to ) wear any dhoti, but has his loins covered with nickers, who is set off by a girdle of three strings tied on his waist and who stands with arms akimbo and appears possessed of three lines on his belly. Though a ms. of the Tirtha portion of Hemadri's work has not yet been recovered, there is no reason to doubt that the verses were taken by Gopālācārya from Hemādri's work, particularly when almost all those verses are quoted by the T. S. (about 1500 A. D.) from the Skandapurana and Kurmapurana. As Hemādri composed his work about 1260 to 1270 A. D. and as the verses quoted by him are cited from the Skandapurāna, it follows that several centuries before 1260 A. D. Pandharpur was known as a tirtha, that the devotee and saint Pundarika. (Marāthi 'Pundlik') also was so known then and that the image of Vithobā was essentially the same in appearance as it is now. That Pandharpur had risen in sanctity and importance in the 15th century follows from the fact that both the great Vaignava saints, Caitanya and Vallabha, visited it. Vide Prof. S. K. De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal'p. 71 for

It has to be noted that गुह्यसूत्रेण or अन्तःसूत्रेण is mentioned separately from कतिबन्धेन and there. fore गृह्यसूत्र or अन्तःसूत्र was something different from कटिबन्ध (waist-band), Probably the original reading was दिग्वासाश्वातिसूक्ष्मेण गुह्यसूत्रेण for दिवासा श्वातिसौम्येन, where सौम्य conveys very little sense.

It has been already shown from the Bombay Gazetteer that there is a tradition about the image having been removed several times and brought back. On pp. 16-25 of his work. Mr. Khare cites various passages from medieval writers in Sanskrit, Marathi and Canarese and comes to the conclusion that the present image is not only not the ancient one but that it was not there in the 17th century, since the characteristics of the present image do not tally with the description contained in the poems of saint Tukārām. I do not agree with his conclusions. He has overlooked several weighty considerations. He has relied upon inferences drawn from the presence of Afzulkhan and the bigoted emperor Aurangzeb in the Deccan. I have cited above (pp. 632, 692) references to the demolition of North Indian temples and images on the orders of Aurangzeb, but Mr. Khare has been unable to show any direct reference to the demolition of the temple or the image of Vithobā on the orders of any Moslem king or officer 1634 We cannot rely on mere inferences or not properly authenticated letters or verses. Besides, the present image is so much worn that unless one very carefully

1634. It may, however, be stated that there is some evidence that efforts were made to demolish the temple of Vithoba by some Moslem king of Bidar and that the Badves (the guardians of the Pandhari temple ) fearing destruction of the image removed it and concealed it somewhere else. In a Marathi work called 'RETIEHETETrat yang by Mr. Narayan Krishna Gadre (1905) p. 168 verses are cited from a life (completed in sake 1667 i. e. 1745 A. D.) of one Changā Mudhesa ( who died in sake 1427 i. e. 1505 A.D.) written by his descendant Shamji Gosavi Vanjarkhede (who was 11th in descent from Changa Mudheśa). The Marathi verses are: बेटरीचा राजा बामणी पातशहा। ब्राह्मणासी बहु छळियेलें। हिंदुधर्म जितुके तितके वर्जियेले ॥ राऊळ विध्वंसिलें पंढरीचे॥ केलीसे मशीद महाद्वार मोडून । सातमास पूर्ण झाले यासी॥ EN HETHET 31 IT T Sadi wa miefill verses 52-55 of the 7th chapter of the life. This was written two hundred and forty years after the alleged vandalism. Besides the same work mentions in verse 94 (chap. 7) that Changadeva thought that the mosque should be demolished and a new temple (a complete replica of the old one) should be built. Similarly, in istaafa ECT part 1 p. 68 (published by the Bharata-itihāsa-samsodhaka mandala of Poona) there is a letter dated in 1581 sake (i. e. 1659-60 A.D.) in Marathi which states that Shivaji killed Afjalakhan who had rerhovedbe image of Vitthal at Pandharpur and that at Tuljāpur. The letter is dat properly authenticated and is not a reliable piece of evidence. I am obliged to Mr. G. H. Khare of Poona for drawing my attention to these two pieces of evidence,

scrutinizes, it would be difficult to pronounce what articles it holds or what dress it wears. Therefore, there is great scope for differences of opinion on the characteristic features of the present image. Conceding for argument that the tradition about the removal of the idol is true, that does not establish that the present image is different from the one that existed in the 13th century or before. The present image has an elongat ed head dress which some may construe as a simple mukuta (crown) with a rim: but the pujāris and common people regard it as a Sivalinga and the rim as the rope of the śikya that is carried on the back (by cowherds ). The present image has ear-rings (as Mr. Khare admits ) but they are so long that they rest on the shoulders. The present image has angadas (armlets) on the upper arms ( and that is the description in the Skanda-purāṇa quoted by Hemādri). The present image has ornaments on the wrists (which the passage from the Skandapurāṇa also mentions). There is a girdle with three strings on the waist of the present image (in Sk, also we have trivrtenānukālena katibaddhena or katibandhena rājitah'). The present image 1635 does not clearly show that a dhoti was worn (and therefore one reading of the Skanda says that it is 'digvāsāh') but the Skanda adds that the image has arms akimbo. In my opinion the description in the Skanda. purāna (which must be held to be at least not later than about 1000 A. D.) tallies in essential particulars with the present image; therefore it follows that sufficient evidence has not been adduced to show that it is comparatively a new image and the proposition of Mr. Khare that it is a different one from the original should be held not proved. In the descriptions given by Tukārām and others (p. 22 of Mr. Khare's book ) actual, legendary and ideal elements are mixed up. For example, Tukārām states that the god has 16000 wives (Mr. Khare's book

1635. Persons not familiar with ancient images or statues in stone might think that an image or statue is naked (digvāsah) when as a matter of fact the sculpture itself shows that the image wears a dhoti and waistband and yet its private parts are shown as visible, probably because it was the intention of the sculptor to indicate that the garment was made of the finest texture and was transparent. For example, in 'History of Fine Art in India and Ceylon' by Vincent Smith, there is a figure of a Bodhisattva-tion p. 143 No. 94 ) which is clearly draped in a dhoti and waistband and then

parts of which are yet visible. The Visnu image from M burji (Plate VI) in a paper on Gupta Art in Journal of U. P. Historical Society vol. 18 pp. 101-134 shows similar characteristics.

p. 22 Bailā sola hajāra' &c.). But Tukārām does mention the facts that the arms are akimbo, that there is no dhoti (digambara), and mentions the existence of a śikya, a stick, also a girdle and ornaments. Lastly, Mr. Khare does not attach sufficient importance to two facts, one being that about 1873 two Gosavis damaged the image which was later re-installed and pilgrims were forbidden from embracing it. It is quite possible that some of the features already indistinct were lost in these happenings (vide Bom. G. vol. 20 p. 430). Besides, for hundreds of years the image has been washed with pañcāmsta (milk, curds, ghee, honey and sugar) and water at least once every day and sometimes several times a day. It is not difficult to imagine that the characteristic marks became blurred by these continual baths.

Some other matters require to be dealt with. The image is variously called viz. Pāṇduranga, Pandhari, Vitthal, Vitthalanātha and Vithobā.

- Visṇu assumes in Prakrit the forms Viṇhu, Viṇṇu, Venhu, Vetha and others. In Canarese Visnu becomes Bitti, Bittiga, Vitta &o. The changes in names do not necessarily follow the rules laid down in Prakrit or Canarese grammars, which rules themselves are often based on meagre data and Mr. A. K. Priyolkar in his learned paper on 'Bhagat Namdeo of the Sikhs' in the Journal of the University of Bombay vol. VII part 2 (1938) points out (p. 24) that in the Ādi Granth of the Sikhs, in the hymns of Namdeo, God is addressed as ‘Bithal' or 'Bithalu' (p. 24), that, in the Gujarati poems of Narsinh Mehta and Mirabai, God is addressed as Vitthala (p. 35) and Vitthala is employed by these saints meaning only Viṣnu and not the deity at Pandharpur. The learned Kāģinātha Upadhyāya, author of Vitthala-rn-mantrasāra-bhāṣya, derives the word Vitthala as (Vit+tha+la) 1636.

As regards the name of the ksetra it appears that origi nally it was called in Canarese Pandarage, of which Pāṇdu ranga is a sanskritized form. When Pundlik, the devotee of Vitthal, became famous the sacred place came to be called Pundarikapura (as in Kūrma) and Paundarikapura (as in Skanda). Vide note 1632 above.

[Vol.

Irof The pilgrims to Pandharpur may be divided into two classes, regular visitors and occasional visitors. The first class comprise those called Vārkaris (lit. those who keep the fixed times). The Vārkaris are of two sorts viz. those who attend every month and those who attend twice a year on the 11th of Asādha-sukla and Kārtika-sukla). This cult of vārkaris has been a great leveller. In theory and to a large extent in practice it ignores caste exclusiveness. A brāhmana vārkari falls at the feet of a sūdra vārkari. There are certain obser vances binding on all vārkarīs (for which, vide Bom, G. vol. 20 p. 471). The vārkari carries a rosary of Tulasi (basil) beads, foregoes flesh-eating, observes a fast on ekādasī, carries an ochre-coloured patākā (swallow-tailed banner) and is to speak the truth (and not to cheat) when engaged in his daily occupations. diw. Bodo

Some people think that the image of Vithobā is really Buddhist or Jain. There is hardly any evidence for this. When such Marathi poets and saints as Ekanatha, and Tukārām speak. of Vithobā as Bauddhāvatāra they have Visnu in mind, 1637 whose 9th avatāra was Buddha according to the Purāṇas and medieval writers.

The question of the attitude that modern Hindus should adopt towards holy places and pilgrimages will be briefly dealt with at the end of the next chapter on the list of tirthas.
