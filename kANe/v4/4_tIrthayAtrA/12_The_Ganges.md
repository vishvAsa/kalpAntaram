CHAPTER XII 

THE GANGES 

Since the Ganges is the holiest of rivers and since such highly esteemed tirthas as Kanakhala, Haridvāra, Prayāga and Kāśi are situated on it, it would be most proper to begin the treatment of individual tirthas with the Ganges, 

It has been already seen (p. 556) how the Ganges is the first among the many rivers invoked in the famous Nadistutz hymn (Rg X.75 5-6). In Rg 1323 VI 45 31 we have the word 'Gangyah' which most probably means 'growing on the Ganges'. In the Satapatha Brāhmana XIII, 5 4 11 and 13 and Ait Br. 39. 9 the victories and sacrifices of Bharata Daussanti on the Ganga and Yamunā are mentioned. In Sat. Br XIII.5 411 and 13 an ancient gūtha is quoted 'At Nādapit the Apsaras Sakuntala conceived Bharata who after conquering the whole earth brought to Indra more than 1000 horses meet for sacrifice.' The Mahābharata (Anuśāsana 26. 26-103) and the Purāpas (such as Nāradīya. Uttarardha, chap 38-45 and 51. 1-18, Padma V. 60. 1-127, Agni chap 110, Matsya chap. 180-185, Padma, Adikhavda. chap 33-37) contain hundreds of verses eulogising the greatness and the sanctifying activity of the Ganges. The Skandapurāna, Kāsikhanda, chap 29 (verses 17-168) contains one thousand nimes of the Ganges. It is not possible to reproduce here even a small fraction of what is said in these works about the Ganges To most men in India great rivers like the Ganges great mountains like the Himalaya present & double aspect, viz the physical aspect and the spiritual aspect A great river apart from its volume of water is deemed to have a spiri tual or divine life which animates it. Tylor (in 'Primitive Culture, 2nd ed. p 477) observes 'What we call inanimate objects rivers, stones, trees, weapons and so forth-are treated as living intelligent beings, talked to, propitiated, punished for the harm they do,' There are separate treatises devoted to the glorifica tion of the Ganges and the pilgrimage to it such as the

The Vanaparra, chap 85, has a grand eulogy of Ganga in verses 88-97, some of which may be translated here 1324 "The Ganges is equal to Kuruksetra wherever one may take a bath in it, but there is a speciality about Kanakhala and in Prayāga there is the greatest and highest (holiness). If a person, after committing a hundred bad deeds, sprinkles him self with Gauges (water), the waters of the Ganges burn all of them as fire burns fuel. In the Krta age all (places ) were boly, in Tretā age Puṣkara was the holiest place), in Drāpara Kuruksetta and in the Kali age the Ganges. The Ganges, when its name is uttered, purifies a sinner, when seen it yields good fortune, when a bath is taken in it or its water is drunk, it sanctifies the family up to the seventh ancestor, As long as (a particle of) the bones of a man touches Ganges Water (i, s lies inside it), so long does the man remain happy (or honoured) in heaven, There is no holy place equal to the Ganges, there is no god higher than Keśaya That country and that penance-grote where the Ganges flows should be known as the sacred spot of success (or perfection) since it attaches itself to the Ganges." The Anuśāsana (26.26, 30-31) asserts 'those dis tricts and countries, those hermitages and mountains, in the midst of which the Ganges flows are pre-eminent in punya (religious merit) Even those men who, after committing sinful acts in the first part of their lives, resort afterwards to the Ganges reach the highest world (or goal). That increase (in merit) which comes to men that bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges and that then become pure in spirit, cannot be secured

even by the performance of hundreds of solem. Vedic sacrifices,' 1325 

In the Bhagavadgita (X.31) Lord Krsna says that among streams he is the Ganges (srotasāmasmi Jābnavi). The Manusmrti setting out an exordium to a witness to tell the truth indicates that the Ganges and Kuruksetra were the most sacred spots in the age of the Manusmrti.1326 Some of the Purāṇas describe the Ganges as flowing in Heaven (as Mandakini), on the earth (as Ganga.) and in the nether regions or Pātāla (as Bhogavati). Vide Padma VI. 267. 47. The Viṣṇupurāna 1327 and other Parādas state that the Ganges springs from the toe-nail of the left foot of Visou. In some Purāpas it is said that Siva let off from his matted hair the Ganges in seven streams, three flowing towards the east (Nalini, Hladini, Pāvani), three to the west (Sita, Caksus and Sindhu) and Bhagirathi (vide Matsya 121. 38-41, Brahmanda IL 18 39-41, Padma I 3. 65-66). The Kurmapurana (1 46.30-31) and Varāba (chap. 82 in prose) state that the Ganges flows first in four different streams, Sita, Alakananda, Sucaksu and Bhadra and that the Alakagandā flows towards the south, comes to Bhāratavarsa and falls into the sea with seven mouths 1328 In the Brahmapurana (73. 68-69) the Ganges is described as sprung from the foot of Vispu and as established in the matted hair of Maheśvara (Śiva). 

The Vispupurāna eulogiseg 1329 the Ganges as follows: The Ganges purifies all beings from day to day when its name is

'1331 The Matsya, Kūrma, Garuda and Padna remark that the Ganges is easy of access everywhere but is difficult to reach at three places viz at Gangādvāra (Haridvāra), at Prayāga and where it joins the sea and that those who batho therein reach heaven and that those who die there are not born again The Nāradīyapurāna, on the other hand, says that tho Ganges is difficult of access everywhere, but much more so at three places The man, whether desiring it or not, who draus near the Ganges and dies (near it) secures heaven and does not see hell (Matsya 107.4),1332 The Kūrmapurāda represents that the Ganges 1333 is equal to all the 35 millions of holy places declared by Vayu in the heaven, in mid region and on the earth and that all of them are represented by the Ganges The Padmapurana asks 'what is the use of sacrifices rick in large wealth, what is the use of very difficult austerities when there is the Ganges honoured easily and gracefully that yields Heaven and moksa'? A similar verse occurs in the Nāradiya-purāna 'what is the use of Yoga with its cight angas, of austerities, of solemn (Vedic) sacrifices? Residence

on the Ganges alone is superior to all these' 1334. Two verses of the Matsya-purana 1335 deserve mention here 'even a man of sinful deeds, on remembering the Ganges even , at a dis tance of thousands of yojanas, attains the highest goal. A person is delivered from sin by uttering the name (of the Ganges), on seeing it a person sees happiness; by bathing in the Ganges and drinking its water he purifies his family up to the seventh ancestor'. Tt is stated in the Kāśikhanda that on the banks of the glorious Ganges all times are auspicious as well as all countries, and all den are fit for receiving gifts 

___In the Varahapurana (chap. 82) the name 'Ganga.' is deri ved as 'gam gata.' (that has gone to the earth). The Padma purana (Srstikhanda 60.64-65) specifies the malamantra.about the Ganges as follows. 'Om namo Gangayai, visvarupinyai narayanyai namo namah'. 

The Padmapurana. (srsti 6035) holds that Viṣṇu repre sents all the gods and the Ganges represents Vispu. It eulo gises the Ganges as follows: Sons abandon their fathers, wives their husbands, friends and relatives abandon a friend or a rela tive if any one of these is adulterous, or patita, or wicked or becomes a cāṇḍāla or kills his guru, or is full of all kinds of sins and hatreds, but the Ganges does not forsake such persons 1336, 

The extent of the holy region of the Ganges is laid down in some puranas. The Naradiya.1337 states. the region

[Vol. within one gavyūti from the banks of the Ganges is called kgetra; one should reside within the ksetra limits, but not on the bank itself; Tesidence on the bank (of the Ganges ) is not desired. The limits of the ksetra are of the extent of one yojana between both the banks' i. e. the ksetra extends for two krosas from each bank. The general rule is stated by Yama that forests, mountains, holy rivers and tirthas are without an owner, these cannot be possessed (by a person as owner). The Brahmapurāna 1338 says that measur ing from the flowing waters for a distance of four hastas, God Nārāyana is the Lord (or owner) and no one should aocept a gift in that strip even if he be on the point of death. A differ ence is made between the garbha (the inner circle) of the Gangāksetra, the tira and the ksetra. 'Garbha' extends up to 1 that portion of the river stream which is reached on the 14th of the dark half of Bhadrapada; beyond that is the tira (bank), which extends upto 150 llastas from garbha and ksetra extends up to two krosas from each bank. 

Let us suppose that the pilgrim has come to the Ganges, Then the question is, how is he to proceed about a bath in the Ganges. Many of the digests contain several alternate forms of the sankalpa to be made at the time of Ganga-gnāna, For example, the Prāyaścittatattva (pp. 497-498) contains a very elaborate sankalpa A simple one is quoted below from the Gangāvākyāvali.1339 The mode of bathing prescribed in the

Procedure of bath in the Ganges 

591 

Matsyapurāna 102 is common to people of all varnas and students of all the different recensions of the Veda. The Matsyapurāna, chap. 10%, which contains one of the earliest procedure of a reli gious bath, and which has been taken over by several digests such as the Gangāvākyāvali (pp. 148–152) is summarised here, Cleanliness (of the body) and clean thoughts do not exist without a bath; therefore bathing is first prescribed for making the mind pure. One may bathe with water drawn (in a vessel from a well or stream) or with water not so drawn. A wise man should fix upon a holy spot after repeating the funda mental mantra 'namo Nārāyanāya' (reverent bow to Nārāyana). Aman holding darbha grass in his hand and being clean and pure should perform ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water). He should select a spot four hastas square on all sides and inpoko the Ganges (to come or be present there) with the following mantras 'you are sprung from the foot of Vigou, you are a devotee of Viṣṇu, you worship Vispu; therefore save us from sins committed from birth to death. Vāgu declared that there are three and a half crores (35 millions) of holy places in heaven, on the earth and in mid air; all these, O Ganges (daughter of Jahou), belong to you. Your name among the gods is Nandini ( the joy-giving) and also Nalini and there are other names of yours viz. Daksā, Prthvi, Vibagā, Viśva kāyā, Amartā, Sivā, Vidyādhari, Supraśāntā, Viśva-prasādini, Ksemā, Jābnavī, Santa, Santipradayini, 13398 One should utter these holy names at the time of bathing; then the Ganges flowing in the three worlds would be near (even if a man bath ed at home). He should, after folding his hands, cast on his head thrice, four times, five times or seven times water on which he has muttered the mantras seven times. After having invoked the clay (in the river bed ) with the mantras 'O earth I Oh clay! you are crossed over by horses and chariots, by Visou, remove my sin which I may have committed by my evil deeds; you were brought up (from the depths of the sea ) by the Boar incarnation of Krsna with his hundred hands, O clayl you are given (to the Vorld) by Brahmā and you had mantras repeated over you by Kāśyapa, Occupying my Jimbs may you drive away all my sin!

Having thus bathed and having sipped water (acamana) according to the procedure prescribed, he should get out of the Ganges and should put on two white and pure garments. Then he should perform tarpana 1340 for the satisfaction of the three worlds. (He should say) 'This water is being offered by me for satiating gods, yaksas, nāgas, gandharyas, apsarases, asuras, cruel snakes, eagles, trees,' jackals, birds, creatures that sustain themselves on air and water or that move in the sky, all beings that are without support and those that are devoted to the dictates of dhar ma'. The person (performing tarpana) should wear the sacred thread in the upavita form (when satiating gods) and then wear it in the

He should devotedly satiate mon, the sages who were sons of Brahimā; he should say "May Sanaka, Sananda and Sanatana, Kapila, Āguri, Vodhu, Panoaśikha-may all these teach satiety by the water offered by me." Then he should satiate with water and akṣata grains (the sages) Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Pracetas, Vasistha, Bhrgu, Nārada; he should satiate all these devarsis, and brahmarsis, 1342 and rṣıs with water and akṣatas. Then wearing the sacred thread in the apasavya mode, bending his left knee on the ground, he satiates with water mixed with sesame and sandal-wood paste pitrs called Agniṣvātta 1343, Saumya, Hayismat, Ūsmapa, Sukalin, Barhisad and others called Ājyapa. He should make a bow to Yama, Dharmarāja, Mityu, Antaka, Vaivasvata, Kāla, destroyer of all beings, Audumbara, Dadhna, Nila, Paramesthin, Vrkodara, Citra and Citragupta. With darbhas in his hand a wise man should satiate his pitrs. He should satiate with devotion his father and the rest by uttering their names and gotra and his maternal grandfather and others in the same way and should recite the following mantra "May those who are my bandhus or not my bandhus or were my bandhus in some previous life reach satisfaction and also whoever desires satisfaction from me,' Then he should sip water (perform ācamana) in the prescribed way and draw the figure of a lotus jn front of himself and offer theroon to the Sun arghya (respectful offering of water) with vater mixed with red sandal-wood paste, flowers and aksatas (grains of rice) and repeat the names of Sūrya (the Sun) 'Bow to theel that are Viṣṇu in another form, that art the face of Visou, that bast thousand rays and that art all refulgence.

The Sm. O. and Raghunandana in his Prayaścittatattva (p. 502) lay down two mantras to be recited at the time of taking a bath in the Ganges 1345 'O Ganges, daughter of Jalinu! That flowest in three worlds, that art sprung from the lotus-like feet of Vispu, that are far-famed as devoted to (the spread of ) dharma, romove my sid; O divine mother, O Bhagirathi! purify with your immortal waters me who am full of faith and devotion. The mantra to be repeated at the time of the bath at the place where the Ganges falls into the ocean according to the same two works is "O god that art the lord of rivers: O goddess that art the best among rivers ! Having bathed at the confluence of both I shall cast off my ging" 

On pp. 243-244 above it has been stated that the Viṣṇu Dh, S. and other works recommend the casting of the ashes or charred bones of a cremated body in the Ganges at Prayāga, Kasi or other holy place and the rites accompanying the cast ing of ashes have been there set out.

Casting ashes in the Ganges 

595 

ashes in the Ganges occurs in several works. The-Agaipurāṇa observes the deceased man benefits if his bones are thrown into the Ganges; a man stays in heaven as long as (even a particle of) his bone remains in the waters of the Ganges. No rites for the dead are performed for those who commit suicide or who are patita; but even in their case the fall of their bones in Ganges water is beneficial to them.' The Tir, 

and Tir. Pr. quote two verses and a half from the Brahma purāpa 1347 which set out a briefer rite of throwing ashes than the one in the Nirnayasindhu. The verses mean: "The man carrying the ashes should take a bath, sprinkle pañcagavya over the ashes, should place on them a piece of gold, honey, ghee and sesame; then he sbould deposit them in an earthen Yessel; he should then look in the southern direction, say 'salutation to Dharma,' enter the waters (of the Ganges), utter, *may he (Dharma or Vispu?) be pleased with me and then cast the ashes in the water; then he should batke in the river, come out of it, cast a look at the Sun and then give a present (daksina) to a brāhmana; if he does so, then the state of the deceased person will be like Indra.' Vide Skanda, Kaśi-khanda 30, 42-46 where a little more elaborate procedure is prescribed, The importance of casting ashes in the Ganges probably owes its origin to the story of king Sagara's sons who were reduced to ashes by the wrath of the sage Kapila and who were saved by the ashes being washed in the waters of the Ganges brought down from heaven by Bhagiratha. Vide Vanaparya chap. 107 109, Vispupurāna II. 8–10 for the story. The Nāradiya makes pot only the throwing of calcined bones a source of benefit to the departed but even his nails and hair when cast in the Ganges confer the same benefit. It is stated in the Kaśikhanda that those who, while standing on the banks of the Ganges, praise another tirtha or do not think very highly of the Ganges go to hell.1347a The Kasīkhanda further provides that there is special and

TRISTHALI 

The three great tirthas of Prayāga, Kasi and Gayā are referred to as Tristbali and the great scholar, Nārāyapabhatts (born in 1513 A D.), wrote (about 1580 4 D.) in Benares a famous work called Tristhalısetu (a bridge to the Tristhall) wherein he gives a thorough and exhaustive treatment of the pilgrimage to these three holy places 134&alone, Prayaga is assigned pp. 1–72, Kaśl pp. 72-316 and Gayā pp. 316-379 (of the Anandāśrama edition). Following with all humilits the footsteps of such an illustrious and venerable scholar I shall deal with the three tirthas in the same order. 

PRAYAGA One of the most ancient reference to the greatness of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā occurs in a khila 1393 Verse which is usually placed in Rg. 1 75 and may be rendered as follows: "Those who take a bath at the place there the

Importance of Prayāga

two rivers, white and dark, moet together, rise up (fly up) to Heaven; those determined men who abandon their body there (i. e. commit suicide by drowning themselves) secure immor tality (or molṣa)". This must have been a comparatively early verse. The Skandapurāna referes to it as śruti. The greatness of Prayaga is dwelt upon in the Mahabharata (Vana parya 85. 69.97, 87. 18-20, Anuśāsana 25. 36-38 ) 1350 and in many purānas such as the Matsya (chapters 103-112, in all 260 Verses), Kūrma I. 36-39 (verses 121), Padma (L. chap. 40-49), Skanda, Kāśi-Khanda, chap. 7. 45–65). Only a few out of the hundreds of verses on Prayaga can be cited here by way of sample. One remarkable fact is that the Rāmāyana does not say much about Prayaga. The confluence of the two rivers is no doubt referred to (Rām. II. 54.6) but from the des cription it appears that there was a forest at what is now Prayāga, Prayaga is called Tirtharāja (the prince among tirthas) in the Matsya 109. 15, Skanda (Kaśī 7,45), Padma VI. 23. 27-35 (where the refrain at the end of each verse is 'sa tirtharajo jayati prayāgah) and elsewhere. The legend runs that Prajapati or Pitamaha (Brahma) performed a sacrifice here and Prayaga is the middle one of the vedis of Brahmā, the others being Kuruksetra in the north (uttarayedi) and Gaya in the east. It is believed that three rivers meet at Prayāga viz, Gangā, Yamuna and Sarasvati (underground between the two). It is said in the Matsya 1351, Kūrma and other Purāṇas that at the very sight of Prayāga, even by taking its name or by applying its clay to one's body a man becomes free from sin. The Kūrmapurāna 1352 proclaims “it is the sacred spot of Prajāpati; those who bathe here go to heaven and those who die here are not born again." That sacred spot is known as tirtharāja ; it is dear to Keśava The same is known as Triyon,

History of Dharmaśāsta 

(Vol. The word Prayāga is employed in the Deuter when connect ed with such words as tīrtha or ksetra, as in Matsya (111 14 prajāpater-idam ksetram prayāgam-iti viśrutam), but when employed along with words (in the masculine gender) such as tirtharāja, it takes the masculina gender.. - 

The word Prayāga is derived in various ways. The Vana parva 1353 appears to suggest that the word'Prayage is derived from the root 'yay' when it says 'Brahmā who is the soul of all beings performed formerly a sacrifice hers; therefore it became known as Prayāga'. In the Skanda 1354 purāna also it appears to be explained by taking the two parts pra and vāga separate ly. "It is mentioned as Prayāga because it is superior to all sacrifices; Prayāga was the name given to it by the gods Hari, Hara and others seeing that it is superior to all sacrifices though the latter be enriched with fees and the like." The Matsyapurāpa 1355 appears to lay emphasis on the part 'pra' when it says 'on account of its efficacy (or power) as compared with all other tirthas it prevails (or is useful) far more'. The Brahmapurāna 1356 affirms "It is called prayāga on account of its eminence and it has the word 'rāja' (in Tirtharāja) applied to it on account of its being the chief". 

We must distinguish between Prayāga-mandala, Prayāga and Veui or Trivani, each subsequent ons being smaller and holier than eaoli preceding one. The Matsya 1357 states that the sphere of Prayāga is five yojanas in circumference and that the moment a man enters inside this strip of land, there is an Asya medha at every step. This has been explained by the Tristhalf setu (p. 15) as follows. Regarding Brahmayūpa (the sacrificial post of Bralmā) as the spike or peg, if one measures with a rope one and one half yojana long all round, that would be the

Boundaries and entent of Prayāga 

599 

Prayagamandala of five yojanas in circumference. The bound aries of Prayaga itself are defined by Vanaparva,1358 the Matsya purāna (104 5 and 106. 30) and others. 'Prayāga extends from Pratisthāna up to the pool of Vasuki and upto the two nagas Kambala and Asvatara and the nāga Bahumūlaka; this is known in the three vorlds as the sacred spot of Prajāpati' (Matsya 104.5), while Matsya 106. 30 provides that to the east of the Ganges is the Samudrakūpa, which is the same as Prati sthāna. This is explained by the Tristhalisetu as follows. the eastern boundary is the kūpa called Pratisthāna 1359, the nor thern one is the Vāsuki pool, the western limit is formed by Kambala and Aśvatara, the southern boundary is Bahumūlaka. This would be a four-cornered space which is included within Prayaga-mandala. According to the Matsyapurāna as quoted by the Kalpataru on tirtha p. 143 the two Nāgas are on the south bank of Yamunā vhile the printed text has 'vipuje Yamunātate' (106 27 ) 1350 The printed text of Padma I 43. 27 supports the Kalpataru reading ('Yamunā-daksine tate) Vepi-ksetra is within the limits of Prayāga itself and is twenty bow ledgths in extent, as stated in the Padma, There are three kupas viz. Prajāga, Pratisthāna and Alarkapura. The Matsya and Agni say "there are three fire kundas and the Ganges flaws in their midst' It should be noted that except where special reference is made in the Purāṇas to the sub tirtlas, the reference to a bath at Prayāga in general means bath in the Veni i. e the confluence of the two rivers, as e. g in Vanaparva 85 81 and 85 and Matsya 104 16-17, 1361

(Yol. The Vanaparva 1362 and some of the Purados represent that the country between the Ganges and the Yamuna is (liko) the hips and loins of the earth (i e, it is the most prosperous and plentiful part of the earth) and that Prayaga is liko the inmost part of the hips. 

The Narasimha-purāpa says that Visou is in the form of Yogamūrti in Prayāga (65 17). It is said in the Matsya purana 1363 (111. 4-10) that when Rudra dissolves the world at the end of the Kaipa, the holy place of Prayaga is not destroyed, that Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara (Śiva) stay in Prayāga, that to the north of Pratisthāna Brahmā stays in it under guiso, that Viṣṇu stays there as Vepi-Madhava, that Sira stays thero as the Vata (banyan tree) and that therefore the gods with the Gan dharvas, the Siddhas and great pages always protect the spherc (mandala) of Prayāga by guarding it against evil actions. The Matsyapurada, therefore, recommends that a pilgrim should go to Prayaga which is protected by all the gods, stay there for a month, avoid sexual intercourse, worship gods and pitrs and thereby secure his desired objects (104. 18). The same Purana highly eulogises the gift at Prayaga of a kapılū cow proporly decked (105. 16-22) with clothes, ornaments and powols. The Padmapurada (Adi 42 17-24) has the same verses as the Matera on this subject Similarly, the marriage of a daughtor in the @rosa form at Prayaga is highly spoken of in Matsya (106, 8-9). The Matsya (105. 13-14 and 106. 10) says generally that if a man makes a gift of a cow, of gold, of precious stonos, of poar): and of other things that he owns his pilgrimage becomes fruita ful (saphala) and lie collects religious merit (punya) and that when & man makes gifts accordiog to his ability ond wealth, the fruit of his pilgrimage increases and he remains in honvon till the end of the world. The Brahmanda 1364 assures pilgrims that whatever gifts are made according to one's ability at

Rewards of gifts at Prayāga Kuruksetra, Prayāga, at the mouth of the Ganges where it falls into the sea, on the Ganges, at Puskara, at Setubandha, at Gangadvāra and in Naimisa tends to confer inexhaustible rewards. In the Vanaparya 1365 it is stated that this sacrificial ground (of Brahma) is honoured even by the gods, that even a small thing donated here assumes greatness (i, e. produces the rewards of large gifts). 

The confluence of the three rivers came to be associated with omkāra, 1366 the mystic syllable that stands for Brahma. It is said in a purana passage (probably Brahmapurāna) that the three parts of om (a um) respectively are Sarasvati, Yamunā and Ganga and that the waters of three rivers represent Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Saṅkarsana Hari. 

It may be noted that, in spite of the fact that the Matsya, Kūrma (I. 36-39), Padma (Ādi chapters 41-49), Agni 111 and other Puradas contain several hundred verses on Prayāga, the Kalpataru (on tīrtha), the earliest extant digest on tīrthas, quotes only the Matsya (104, 1-13 and 16-20, 105. 1-22, 106. 1-48, 107.2-21, 108. 3-5, 8-17 and 23-34, 109, 10-12, 110. 1-11, 111. 8-11, in all about 151 Verses) and Vanaparya chap. 85. 979-87 and 97 and does not add & single word of explanation or discussion, But the other digests profusely quoting mostly froin Purāṇas discuss at some length several topics and a few words must be devoted to some of those topics. 

One such topic is tonsure at Prayāga It is stated by the Gangāvākyāvali (p. 298) and the Tir Pr. (p. 335) that, though the author of the Kalpataru says nothing about tonsure at Prayāga, yet as śistas (respectable and learned people) and the writers of digests accept it as necessary, certain autho rities would be set out. The two verses quoted by most 13664 writers are one should tonsure the head at Prayaga, offer pindas at Gayā, make gifts in Kuruksetra and should commit

Elaborate discussions are held by all these works about the exact inten tion of the verses, about the application of the maxim of rātrisattra 1367 to them and about the results derived from ton. sure. They have to be passed over here from considerations of space. The Tristhali-setu (p. 17) holds that the verse only prai ses the rite of tonsure at Prayaga and the fruit thereof is simply the removal of sin, The Tri. S. refutes (p. 17) the application of rāta 29atiramnyāya to these verses, while Tir. 0 (p. 32) applies it. Some of the conolusions drawn by the Tri S. are that in one and the same yātrā at Prayaga (even if a man stays there for some days) ceremonial tonsure takes place only once, that widows have to tonsure their heads, that in the case of women whose husbands are living only two or three finger-breadths of tresses are to be cut and offered at the Triveni, that even 13678 boys whose upanayana has not been performed have to undergo tonsure provided the cūdā rite has already been performed, The Tristhaligetu (p. 22) notes that certain traditionalista, 1365

The Nāradiya (Uttara) 63. 106 provides the same rule as Parāśara (in note 278 above) for women, The Prayascittatattva of Raghubandana prescribes the complete tonsure of the head for women at Prayāga. 

It appears probable that the provision for the casting of zenī (braided hair) on the part of women whose husbands were alive vas suggested by the word Teni applied to the confluence of the two rivers, where the river Ganges appears to make a bend or curre for some distance 1369 

One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieral Indian writers was whether and Then suicide, particularly at sacred spots like the confluence of the Ganges and Jumnā or at the foot of the Aksaya Vata at Prayaga, rould involve no sin.1379 This matter has already been

dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II pp 924-928 and vol. I, pp. 939, 948-949. Only a brief treatment by way of a summary of the pages and a few notes will be added here. The general sentiment of Dharmaśāstra works is to condemn suicide ar an attempt to commit suicide as a great sin (vide H of Dh vol I paga 924 for texts). The Āp. Dh. S. (1 10 28 15-17) mentions the view of Harita which condemns suicide even as prāya scitta for committing a mahāpātaka (like incest) and puts kill ing another or killing onoself on the same footing Manu V. 89 and Yaj. II. 154 condemn suicide by denying after-death rites to those who commit it, but Manu allowed suicide in various ways as prāyasoitta for mahāpatakas (vide Manu XI. 73, 90-91, 103-104). But exceptions to the condemnation of suicide are found in the startis, epics and purānas, They way he grouped under several heads. (1) Suicide as an exception in various ways by those guilty of mahāpātakas (viz. brahmana murder, drinking of suā, theft of brāhmana's gold and incest), vide H. of Dh. VOL II. pp. 924-925 for smrti and other texts, (2) Starting on the Great Journey (makāprasthana-ganana or maliāpathayātrā) by a forest hiermit (Manu VI, 31, Yaj. II, 55) suffering from incurable diseases and unable to perform tha duties of his order (3) An old nan or one who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or who is so ill as to be beyond medical skill may kill himself by throwing himself from a precipios or by fire or by drowning or fasting or start on the Great Journey into the Himalaya or by jumping from the bran ches of the Vata tree at Prayāga (Aparārka p 877 quoting Adi-purāna and Atri-smrti verses 218-219 q, by Medhātıthi on Manu V, 88 and Mit. on Yāj II. 6) (4) Even a house holder, otherwise all right, may resort to suicide by the means stated (in No. 3) if his life's work is dono, if he has no desire for the pleasures of the world and does not desire to live, or if he is & Vedāntin371 and coavinced of the ephemeral nature of life and may kill himself by fast in Himalaya. (5) Religious suicide was allowed at the confluence of the two great rivers Gangā and Yamunā, at the Vata there and at some other tirthas (6) A wife dying by sahagamana or anumarana. As to Sati, the Nāradiya (pūrvārdha 7. 52-53) provides that a woman should not burn herself on the funeral pyre of her husband if she has a

young child or young children, if she is pregnant or if she has not attained puberty, or if she is in her monthly illness, at the time. Not only did common men believe in the pro mise of the Purāṇas that those who killed themselves at Prayaga (at the sangama or near Vata) secured moksa (freedom from the everlasting cycle of births and deaths) which was the highest of the four purusārathas (goals of human existence ), but even great poets like Kalidasa held the view that, though noksa or Tarralya or apavarga requires correct knowledge and realisation of the Supreme Spirit according to the Vedānta, Sāṅkhya and Nyāya systems, death at the sacred sangama led to moksa even without 'tattvajñāna.' In H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 925-927, historical ex amples of kings such as Yasah-karnadeva, Candella Dhangadev and Calukya Someśvara committing suicide at Prayāga or the Tungabhadrā have been given. The king Kumāragupta of Magadha is said to have entered the fire of dry cow-dung cakes. This is in accordance with the prescriptions in the Matsya purāpa 107. 9–10 (=Padma, Adi-khanda 44 3) which states 1372 'the man who, suffering from no diseases, having no deficiency as to his limbs and being in full possession of his five senges, encompasses (his death) in cowdung fire remains honoured in heaven for as many years as there are pores on the whole of his body.* 1373 The Rājatarangini VI. 14 refers to officers entrusted with the duty of supervising suicide by fast (prāyopaveśa).

History of Dharmaśāsti a 

[ Vol. The important verse on which reliance is placed for sanctioning religious suicide at Prayāga may be translated-1374 as follows. You shoujd not set aside (pass Over) your wish about dying at Prayāga on account of the words of the Veda or the words of the people.' The words of the Veda 375 are Vaj. 8,40 3(=Iśāvāsyopanisad 3) which literally translated means "there are worlds of Asuras enveloped in blinding darkness, those who have killed themselves repair after deatlı to those worlds' This verse does not in the context appear to refer to 3 person committing suicide, but rather to a person who kills his soul by remaining in ignorance of the true Self. But even learned writers and posts took it to refer to suicide (vide Uttara rāmacarita, Act IV after verse 3). Another passage of the Veda on which reliance may be placed is the one in the Satapatha Brābmana X. 2. 6. 7 'one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass avay before the full extent of life, for at (such shortening of full life) does not make for the (heavenly) world' By the words of the people are meant smrti passages con demping suicide such as Gaut. 14, 12, Vag 13752 23. 14–15, Manu

IV) 

There is no doubt that some of the swirlis, the Maha bharata 1376 itself and somo purāpas do recommend (or at least do not condemn) suicide in certain circumstances. A few purāda passages may be quoted here. Two verses of the Kūrma state 'That goal (or state), which a wise man that is devoted to Yoga and that has become an, ascetic (or has forsaken all actions) reaches, is secured by him who gives up life at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā. Whoever dies in the Gangā whether wilfully or unintentionally is born after death in heaven and does not see hell', 1377 The Kūrma is quite clear *Moksa may be secured or not after a thousand births else where but in Benares moksa can be secured in a zingle birth' (1. 32. 22) The Padma 1378 is quite emphatic a man who, knowingly or unknowingly, wilfully or unintentionally, dies in the Ganges secures on death heaven and molsa'. A verse of the Skanda asserts 'He who abandons his life in this sacred place in some way or other does not incur the sin af suicide but secures his desired objects.' The Kūrma (T. 38 3-12) refers to four modes of suicide and promises residence in heaven and Tarious other rewards for thousands of years, viz, by (1) burn ing oneself in the slow fire of dry cowdung cakes, (2) by enter ing the water at the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, (3) by hanging with head down in the stream and feet up and drinking 

2376. Vide the references given under No. 2 and 3 of the five classes of cscusable or permitted suicides on p. 604 above. The Mahābbarata has a parva called Mahāprāsthānika in which it is garrated (cbap 1, 24) that Yudhisthira with his four brothers, qaeen Draupadi and a faithful dog started on the Great Journey towards the Himalaya and that they fell down dead one after another, Draupadi being the first and Bhima the last.

Hilory of Dharmasastra 

[ Vol. the wators of the Ganges, (4) by cutting off his own flesh and giving it ag food to birds. The famous Chinese traveller Hiquen Thgang (about 629-645 A. D.) clearly refers to this practica of religious suicide (vide Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Wes torn world,' vol. I. pp. 232–234). The Kalpataru on Tirtha (cotaposed about 1110-1120 An D.) devotes a special section to Mshapathayatra (pp. 258-265). Gradually, the idea of secur ing hoaven and moksa by committing suicide at Prayaga or Bonares appears to have spread to other tirthas. Vanapārya 1379 speaks of suicide at Prtbūdaka (Pebore in the Karna) district of Punjah, 14 miles from Thanesar) The Brahmapurāda 1380 calls upon dvijas who are intent on securing moksa to commit suicide at Purusottama-kśetra, The Lingapurada 1381 Bays 'lf a brahmapa kills himself on Srisaila be destroys his sins and attains moksa es at Avimusta (Benares); there is no doubt about this'. The Padma promises 1382 a similar reward for suicide by fire or by fast at the confluence of Narmadā and Kāferi (a small river, not the great South Indian river). 

Gradually there was a ropulsion of feeling against suicide at Prayāga or Kāśī or starting on the Great Journey. Among the actions forbidden in the Kali age are included 'starting on the Great Journey' and 'suicide of old people jumping from a precipice or by fire' (vide H, of Dh, vol. II, pp. 939, 958-59). Some of the later medieval writers fry very hard to combat the view that religious suicide is permitted 1383 Nilakantha, the commentator of the Mahabharata, hojds that Vanaparys 85. 83 (ne vedavacazāt &c) refers to natural death 2 Prayaga and tiot to wilful death and that the Khila Verde ('Sitāsits' quoted above od p. 596) bias the same meaning. Then he propounds tiro alternative interpretations of Yanaparpa 85.

Both the Gangavakyavali (pp. 304-310) and the Tir.c (pp. 47-52) hold that all varnas have the authority to resort to suicide at Prayaga, The Tir. Pr holds a long, learned and highly polemic discussion on the subject of religious suicide at Prayaga (pp. 346-355), Its own view appears to be that a brāhmada should not commit this suicide at Prayāga on account of the prohibition contained in Kalivarjya verses and that members of the other varnas may do so. The Tristbalisetu also enters upon a long discussion (pp. 47-55) and its conclu sions are that in suicide at Prayāga for the attainment of moksa or other rewards (such as heaven) there is no sin, that this suicide at Prayaga is not forbidden 1384a to brahmanas as some think (since Agni 111 8 reads 'na vedavacanad vupma'), that persons whether seriously ill or in good health 1385 may resort to suicide at Prayāga, that no one has authority to commit suicide at Prayaga after abandoning to their fate one's old parents, young wife and children that require support, nor should a woman who is pregnant or who has young children or who has no permission from her husband, commit suicide at Prayaga.1386 It is refreshing to find Nārāyanabhatta, perhaps

Alberuni in his work on India composed about 1030 A D. says about religious suicide that "it was resorted to by those who are tired of life, who are distressed over some incurable disease, some irremovable bodily defect or old age or infirmity. This however no man of distinction does, but only vaiśyas and gūdras. Burning oneself is forbidden to brahmanas and ksatriyas by a special law, Therefore these if they want to kill themselves do so at the time of an eclipse in some other manner or they hīre somebody to drown them in the Ganges,' (tr. by Sachau, vol. I p 170). The Tri. S. S. provides that a man desirous of committing religious suicide at Prayaga should first perform a prāyaścitta,

should perform his own śrāddha upto the offering of pinda if he has no relative entitled to perform it, should fast that day, should make a sankalpa next day preceded by a writing (to inform people of his desire to die in that way) and enter the holy waters contemplating on Visou. On his death, his relatives have to observe āśauca only for three days (and not for ten) and on the 4th day the śrāddhas of the 11th day are to be performed for him.2388 

The psychological background behind the religious suicide at Prayaga and other places is not difficult to realise. Canturies of philosophical thought had made a very deep impression on the minds of all people that the soul has to subdiit to a never-ending cycle of births and deaths, Ancient scriptures had offered & release in two ways viz. by tattvagfiana and by suicide at a tirtha. Death had no great terror for the pilgrim who submitted to various inconveniences and priya tions ungrudgingly. If one is determined to put an end to sansūra by taking one's life, what nobler environment could have been imagined or indicated than at Prayaga, where two mighty rivers flowing from the sacred Himalaya unite and carry on unceasingly their work of fertilizing the land and bringing prosperity and solace to millions of needy and anxious people ? 

While on this topic of religious suicide, it would not be out of place to briefly refer to the discussion in the digests about the meaning of the statement in the puranas that those who die at Prayāgā are not born again (e.g. Matsya 180, 71 and 74). The answer is foreshadowed in the Matsyapurāna itself (18%, 22-25) which 2009 says: At the time of death, when the vital

History of Dharmaśāstia 

[Vol. parts of the human body are being shattered, wemory must fail a human being that is about to be pushed on (to another body) by the vital breath (when it leaves the mortal coil). But at the time of death in Aviraukta (Vārānasi) Lord (Siva) himself Whispers (higher knowledge) in the ears of his devotees that are about to be pushed into new bodies) by (accumulations of their actions). À man dying Dear Mapikarnikā pool teaches the desired goal; he being guided by the Lord reaches the goal which is difficult of attainment by those whose minds are not pure.' In the Kāśikhanda it is expressly stated that moksa does not directly result in these cities (viz. Kāśī &c). But in spite of these warnings the popular belief fostered by the literal mean ing of hundreds of Purāpa passages is that moks& results from dying at Prayāga or in Kāśiksetra, 

The practice of religious suicide has a very respectable antiquity. In the 4th century B. C. Kalanos, the Indian Gymnosophist from Taxila who had accompanied Alexander from India, burnt himself alive on a fuperal pyre at Sousa, when being over 70 years old, he was aflicted with a malady that made life more and more burdensome. Vide J W McCrindle's 'Invasion of India by Alexander the Great' (Nov Edition 1896) pp. 46, 301, 386-392, Strabo inforps us of & gymnosophist from India named Zarmanochegas of Broach who accompanied an embassy to Augustus Caesar at Athens and consigned himself to flames (vide 'Invasion of India by Alexander' p. 389). Hiouen Thsang (Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Western World' vol. I, pp. 232-234) refers to suicide at Prayaga. The Jains, while on the one hand they laid the greatest emphasis on 'abimsa' (non-injury), encouraged reli gious suicide (called 'Sallekhana') in certain cases 1390. 

Some of the works, vix, tha Kaśkorti-moksa-vicāra of Sureśvara (pp. 2-9), tha Tristhalisetu (pp. 50-55) and the Tirthaprakāsa (pp. 313-318) discuss at some length how mere death (either involuntary or voluntary) in Vārānasi or Prayāga would lead to moksa Considerations of space prevent & complete stateinent of their views Their arguments are briefly as follows:--Karma is of three kinds, viz sancita (col

operate by giving the soul the present body) and hriyamūna (to be done in this body and in future). The Upaniṣads and the Gita 1391 declare that, just as waters do not stiok to a lotus leaf, so evil deeds do not cling to a man who knows this knowledge of brahma), that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all harma and that mioksa results from the realization of the Supreme Spirit (Vedanta-sutira IV. 1. 13). From this it follows that a man who has realized the Highest Reality will not be affected by the acts done by him after realiza tion and his accumulated actions (sancita) will be des. troyed by that realization. The present body in which the soul realizes brahina was due to that part of his karma which had begun to operate. When the present body perishes in the case of a man who has realized bralma he attains final release, since no actions remain for producing effects. To the man who dies a natural death in Benares is given at the time of death the Taraka (saving) mantra The Matsyapurana says:1392 those who enter fire according to the rules in Avimukta (i. 8. Benares) enter the mouth of Siva and so also those determined devotees of Siva who die by fast in Benares do not return (to this world) even after millions of halpas. Therefore all those who die in any way at 1393 Benares receive Grace from Siva after their death That leads to tattuajñāna (correct spiritual knowledge) which leads to moksa In rare passages it is espressly stated that mokṣa cannot 1394 be immediately secured

(by dying) in these cities. The Tāraka-mantra is variously explained. According to Sureśvara, Tāraka-mantra is the mystio syllable on which is a symbol of brahma as stated in the Tai. Up. (I. 1.8 Om-ti brahma) and the Gita (8. 13 Om ityekāksaram brahma). The Tri. S. gives another explanation besides this. According to Rāmatapaniya Upanisad and 1395 the Padmapurāpa the mantra is 'sri-Rama-Rama-Rāmeti.' 

There aro several sub-tirthas that fall under Prayāga The inost important of them is the famous Vata (banyan tree) called Aksaya-Vata (the imperishable Vata). The Agoi (111. 13) states 'if & man dies at the foot of the Vata and in the Sangama he goes to the city of Viṣṇu'. Special reference is made to abandoning ono's lifo at the foot of the Vata. The Kūrma1396 says 'He, who abandons life at the foot of the Vati, passes beyond heavenly worlds and goes to the world of Rudra'. The following are the sub tirthas of Prayaga and only references are given to the works in which they are described : (1) the two Nagas called Kambala and Aśvatara which according to some are on the spacious (vipula) bank of tlie Jumnā and according to others on the southern bank of the Jumna (Vanaparva 85 77, Matsya 106. 27, Padma, Adi 39 69, Agni 111. 5, Kūrma I. 37, 19), (2) Pratisthāna on the eastern side of tho Ganges, being the same as the Samudra-kūpa (Vana parva 85. 77, Matsya 106, 30, Kūrma I 37.22, Padma, Ādı. 43,30; Vanaparva 85. 114 appears to suggest that Pratisthana is another name of Prayāga; (3) Sapdhyāvata (Matsya 106. 43, Kūrma I. 37.28, Agni 111. 13); (4) Hamsaprapatana to the porth of Pratisthāna and to the east of the Ganges (Matsya 106. 32, Kūrma I. 37, 24, Agni 111. 10, Padma, Adi 39.80 and 43.32, (5) Kotitirtha (Matsya 106, 44, Kūrma I 37.29, Agni 111, 14, Padma, Adi 43, 44; (6) Bhogayati, the Vedi of Prajāpati to the north of Vasuki (Vanaparpa 85.77, Matsya 106.46, Agni 111. 5, Padma, Adi 39. 79 and 43,46; (7) Daśāśvamedhaka (Matsya 106.46, Padma, Adi 39.80); (8) Urvasipulina, suicide at which

The Purādas lay down that if a man starts on a pilgrim age, but dies on the way to Prayaga he reaps great benefits even without reaching it, provided he dies remembering Prayāga, The Matsyapurāna (105, 8-12) asserts : 1400 A. man whether in his own country or house or after leaving his country dies in a forest, while remembering Prayaga, he still secures the world of Brahma; he reaches a world where the

At most famous tīrthas the pilgrim has to perform śrāddha. The Viṣṇu Dh, S. ( chap 85) mentions about fifty-fire sacred places which'are fittest for śrāddha The Kalpataru (on tirtha), the Gangāvākyārali, Tir, O. and other digests quote several verses from the Devipurāna, the gist of which is as follors Sraddha should be performed at tirthas, but there is no offering of ar ghya and no āvāhana (since pitrs are deemed to be always present at tirthas, as the Kāsikhanda says) nor is the entering of tlie thumb of the invited brālmana into the food served done, nor is there the question about the brāhmanas being satiated, nor uzkera 2601 If one is unable to follow the complete procedure of śrāddha one should merely offer pindas made from barley meal or may offer sanyāva (cake of wheat flour fried with ghee and milk), rice boiled in milk, the cake of sesame (after the oil is extracted) or jaggery 1402 It should not be allowed to be seen by dogs, crows and vultures, it may be offered at any time after the pilgrim reaches the holy place A sraddha performed at a holy place gives great satisfaction to pitrs. Some of the works such as the Tristhalisetusārasangrala of Bhattoji provide that after performing a pārranaśrāddba at a tirtha and after making offerings of pindas to one's ancestors one should offer a single pinda to one's other relatives with the following mantra Here I offer pinda to deceased persons of my father's family, and of my mother's family and to the deceased relatives of my guru and of aiy father-in-law, to those men of my family

who were devoid of sons or wives and so who would lose the benefit of the pinda (to be offered by the son or wife) and in the case of whom all rites after death have seased, those who were blind from birth or were cripples, those who were mal formed or died in the womb; to all these, whether known or unknown to me, may this (pinda) reach inexhaustively! (Vāyu 110. 51-52). After this he should offer another pinda for his servants, slaves, friends, dependents, pupils, persons who conferred obligations on him, cattle, trees and those with whom he came in contact in other lives (Vāyu 110.54-55). If a person is ill or has not the time to go through this elaborate pro cedure, then he should make a sankalpa that he would perform śrāddha and should offer a single pinda with the mantra (in Vāyu 110 23–24) "I offer this pinda to my father, grand-father, great-grand-father, to my mother, father's mother, grandfather's mother, to my maternal grandfather and to the latter's father and grandfather. May it reach them inexhaustively'. 

The Anuśāsana-parva, the Kūrmapurāna, Nāradiya (uttara) 63. 19-20 and 36-38 and others highly praise bathing at the sangama in the month of Māgha 1403Men of all castes, women and those born of mixed unions can take this bath; śūdras, women and men of mixed castes should not repeat any mantra but should bathe silently or with the word 'namah (Tri. S. p 39). Similarly, the Padma, Kūrma, Agni and other Purāṇas vax eloquent over a bath for three days in Magha saying that it is equal to the gift of three crores of cows, 1404 There is great divergence as to exactly what three days are meant, as pointed out by the Tri. S. p 33. The various views are the three days are the passage of the sun into Capricornus, Rathasaptami and the full moon day of Magba; the three consecutive days including the 10th of the bright half of Māgha, the first three days of Magha, the three consecutive days from the 13th day of the bright half of Māgba; any three days in Māgha,
