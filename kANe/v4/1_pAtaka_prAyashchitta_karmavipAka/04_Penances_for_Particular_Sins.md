PENANCES FOR PARTICULAR SINS

CHAPTER IV

PENANCES FOR PARTICULAR SINS

It is now proper to turn to the penances prescribed for individual sins of different types (grave sins, minor sins and the like). It may be noted that the smrtis contain numerous prāyaścittas for the same sin and that it is often difficult to reconcile all the dicta. The commentaries and digests such as the Mit, and the Prāyaścitta-viveka therefore try to assign to each penance an appropriate provision, looking to all the circum stances noted above (i.e. they are bent on 'visayavyavasthā').206a In this work, it is not necessary to set out in detail the numerous penances for numberless lapses that are prescribed in the several smrtis and digests. In the Sabdakalpadruma (part III) there is an analysis from the Prāyaścitta-viveka alone of the several lapses, the penances for them, the number of cows to be donated as substitutes, the monetary equivalents when even cows cannot be donated and the daksinā in each case, which occupy pages 321 to 364. Setting out all these lapses together with the penances for them would only be a matter of academic interest and of no practical value, as almost all the prāyaścittag have become antiquated and are hardly ever performed now except in the form of gifts of cows or money to brāhmanas, pilgrimages and recitation of Vedic mantras or japa of the names of some favourite deity such as Visnu or Siva. Therefore only a few typical sins alone will be taken for treatment here and later on a list of all penances with brief descriptions will be furnished

First come the Mahāpātakas. Sankha 207 (17. 1-3) prescribes the following penance for the four mahāpātakas: the sinner should bathe thrice every day, should erect in a forest a cottage thatched with leaves, should sleep on the ground, should subsist

on leaves, roots and fruits, should enter a village for alms all the time declaring his misdeed, should eat only once a day, When the 12th year passes in this way, the thief of gold, the drinker of surā, the murderer of a brāhmana and one who is guilty of incest become free from sin. Visnu Dh. S. 34.1 speaks of sexual intercourse with one's mother, daughter or daughter in-law as ati pātaka and (34.2) provides that there is no penance except entering fire for this grave sin. The Bhavisyapurāna, Harita and Samvarta (q. by the Pr. V. p. 43) say the same. But other smộtis like Manu XI. 54 and Yāj. III, 227 treat mātr gamana as a mahāpātaka (gurutalpa-gamana) and intercourse with the daughter or daughter-in-law as equal to violating guru's bed (Manu XI, 58, Yāj. III. 233-234). Therefore we begin with the mahāpātakas the first of which is the murder of a brāhmana. Gaut. 22. 2-10, Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 10-25 and I. 9. 25. 12-13, Vas. 20. 25-28, Vişnu Dharmasūtra 35.6 and 50. 1-6 and 15, Manu, XI. 72-82, Yāj. III. 243-250, Agnipurāna 169. 1-4 and 173. 7-8, Samyarta 110-115 and many others prescribe various penances for brāhmana-murder. As the treat ment of Manu is tolerably long, an analysis of it alone will be given here. Manu as stated by the Bhavisyapurāna (quoted by Kullūka on Manu XI. 72-82, Aparārka p. 1055 and Pr. V. p. 63) speaks of 13 separate penances for brahmahatyā.208. The general rule was that for a man of any class who is directly guilty of intentional murder of a brāhmaṇa the penance was to end in death209 The thirteen penances as set out by Govindānanda in his commentary (called Tattvārthakaumudi) on Prayascittaviveka (p. 63) are as follows:

(1) The murderer of a brāhmaṇa should construct a hut in a forest and dwell therein for twelve years, should subsist on alms and should carry a piece of the head-bones of the murdered man on a staff. This is a very ancient penance and other smrtis add some details. For example, Gaut. 22. 4 provides that the sinner should submit to observances meant for a Vedic student (such as not partaking of flesh, honey etc. stated in

Gaut. 2, 19), should announce his sin and enter a village only for begging a]ms. Yāj. III. 243 prescribes that the sinner should have a piece of the head-bone in the hand (left) and another placed on a staff (in the right hand) and that he should eat a moderate quantity (i. e. only once a day). The carrying of the piece of the head-bone in one hand is not meant for begging alms therein but only as a symbol. There was some divergence of views on this point209. Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 14 further provides that he should beg for alms at seven houses in only a broken reddish vessel (of clay or copper) and wear a piece of hempen cloth round his waist that will reach a little above his knees and that if he got no food at the seven houses he had to go with out food that day and that he should protect cows and may for that purpose (for taking them out for grazing or bringing them back) enter the village again. The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 243) adds that the staff with head-bone on and the head-bone carried in the left hand are merely symbolic (in order to remind hin others of his being guilty of brāhmana murder), that he should on seeing an arya avoid his path (Gaut.22.5), that he. should keep standing by day and only sit down at night (Gaut. 22.6) and bathe thrice in the day (Gaut. 22.6). It is added by the Mit. that, if the murdered brahmana's head-bone cannot be had, that of any other brahmana would do. The Mit. adds that this vrata 210 for twelve years propounded by Gautama, Manu, Yājñavalkya and others is one and not different for each smrti and therefore all the details that are not opposed to each other should be included. Aparārkap. 1053 (on Yaj. III. 243) relies on the ‘sarvasākhāpratyayanyāya '211 and states

tliat there would be an option where the details of several arrtis are in conflict. It was Visvarūpa 212 on Yāj. III, 237 who held that the procedure prescribed by each smrti was separate and that all details taken from different smrtis were not to be mixed up. According to the Mit. and Kullūka (on Manu XI. 72 ) this vrata for 12 years is appropriate in the case where a brāhmana is murdered unintentionally and Kullūka quoting Angiras provides that for intentional brāhmana murder the penance will be double (i. e. 24 years). The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 243) states that this observance for twelve years applies only to one who was himself directly the murderer of a brāhmaṇa and that the anugrāhaka has to undergo only 9 years' vrata, the prayojaka only six years, the anumantā only 41 years and the nimittin only three years. It is further provided by the Mit. (on Yaj. III, 243) following a verse ascribed to Manu (not found in the printed text) and Devala 213 that if a man commits several murders of brāhmaṇas one after another, and performs penance at one time for them, for two murders he has to undergo the penance for 24 years and for three murders 36 years and when he commits the 4th murder there is no penance (but only death is the penance). The Pr: T. (p. 468) on the other hand, 214 following the Bhavisya-purāņa holds that one per formance of the 12 years' penance is enough penance for the murder of several brāhmanas, on the analogy of the Kşāmavati işti (Jai. VI. 4. 17-20 ) which is performed when both the purodāsas and the house are totally burnt up by accident before the oblations are offered. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 19 a) also says the same and adds that Devala's verse is to be interpreted as laying down that repetition of the same sinful act is more blamable. If the murderer of a brāhmana

was a ksatriya or a vaisya or a śüdra he had to perform the penance above described respectively for 24, 36 or 48 years (Smrtyarthasāra p. 105). Instead of staying in a hut for twelve years he may stay at the end of a village or a cowpen and should tonsure his head and the hair on the lips or he may stay in an hermitage or at the foot of a tree and should devote himself to doing good to brāhmanas and cows and should observe celibacy (Manu XI. 78 and 81). At the end of 12 years he destroys the sin of brāhmana-murder.

(2) According to Ap. Dh, S.I. 9.25.12, Gaut 22. 3, Manu XI. 72, Yāj. III, 248, if a ksatriya intentionally killed a brāhmaṇa he may at his will enter a fight and if he were killed by his opponents who knew that he was a brāhmaṇa murderer or even if he was wounded and left unconscious on the field but subsequently recovered he should be free from the sin of brāhmana-murder.

(3) According to Āp. Dh. S. I. 9.25.13, Vas. 20. 25-26, Gaut. 22.2, Manu XI. 74, Yaj. IHI. 247, he may cut off with an axe his hair, skin, blood, flesh, muscles, fat, bones and marrow and offer them into an ordinary fire kindled by him for the purpose and offer these eight offerings into it for Death 215 (Mrtyu) as the deity and then throw himself into fire (thrice with head downwards, according to Manu XI. 73). This pen ance is for intentional murder of a brāhmana by a ksatriya acc. to the Madanapārijāta and Bhavisyapurāņa q. by Pr. Prakāśa folio 95 a. to

(4)-(8) The murderer of a brāhmana may perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice or Gosava or Abhijit or Visvajit or the threefold Agnistut (Manu XI. 74). The Aśvamedha could be performed only by a king or an emperor (samrāj). The others could be performed by any one belonging to the three higher classes. This applies only where the murder was unintentional as stated by Kullūka following the Bhavisyapurāna.216 Visņu

[ Vol dharmasūtra (chap. 35 last verse ) states that all persons guilty of any of the mahāpātakas are purified by the performance of Ašvamedha or by going to all the tirthas on the earth.

(9). Manu XI. 75 provides that for the removal of the sin of brahmahatyā, the sinner may walk one hundred yojanas, sub sisting on limited food, controlling his senses and reciting one of the four Vedas. Kullūka says that this applies only where the killing is unintentional and the victim is a mere brāhmaṇa by caste (i. e. has not studied the Veda &c.). For yojana, vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 145 note 185.217.

(10) Manu XI, 76 provides that the murderer of a brāh mapa may make a gift of all his wealth to a brāhmana who has studied the Veda.

(11) Manu XI. 76 and Yaj. III, 250 provide that the mur derer may donate to a worthy brāhmaṇa (who has studied the Veda and whose character is good) as much wealth as would suffice to maintain the latter throughout his life and a house with all paraphernalia. This is the view of Govindānanda. But the Mit, on Yāj. III, 250 appears to hold that Nos, 10 and 11 are not separate penances. It combines the two into one. viz, that if the murderer has no offspring then he was to donate all his wealth or if he had offspring he was to donate a house with paraphernalia. This explanation is certainly preferable. The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 105 ) states that if the murderer is devoid of qualities but is well-off he may give a house and lands sufficient for the maintenance of a worthy brāhmana or he may donate a house with appurtenances or if he be childless all his wealth.

ghee ) should follow the course of the (holy ) river Sarasvati in all its branches. This, acc. to the Bhavisyapurāna and Kullūka, applies where a mere brāhmana by caste (without Vedic learning) is killed intentionally by a man who is himself rich but has no vedic learning. The words 'pratisrotah sarasvatim' have been variously explained. Medhātithi explains as above. Aparārka, Sarvajñanārāyana and Rāghavānanda explain that the murderer should follow the course of the Sarasvati in the opposite direc tion from the sea to its origin. This appears to be a better explanation, since it brings out the force of 'pratisrotah' more clearly.

(13) It is provided by Manu XI. 77 and Yāj. III. 249 that the murderer should recite in a forest thrice the samhitū text of the Veda, while gubsisting on limited food. The express mention of samhitā text precludes the pada text or krama. The Bhavisyapurāpa and Kullūka hold that this penance is proper where a mere brāhmaṇa by birth (without Vedic learning ) is killed unintentionally,

Manu XI. 79, Yāj. III. 244 and 246, Vas. 20.27-28 and Gaut. 22. 7-8 and 11 mention three more penances, but they are not independent ones ( as is made clear by Sankha). If a murderer, while undergoing the 12 years' penance, fights hin who attacks a brāhmana and saves him (or fights for the king, acc. to Vas.) or dies in the attempt, he becomes at once free from the sin and if he lives after the fight he had not to continue the penance for the whole period. The same applies to the saving of 12 cows by the murderer by putting his own life in danger219. Similarly, if a murderer fights a marauder depriving & brāhmaṇa of all his wealth and restores the wealth to a brāhmana or dies in the attempt or is severely wounded (thrice ace, to Yaj, Vas, and Gaut.) and is unable to restore the wealth to the brāhmaṇa he becomes free from the grave sin of brāhmaṇa murder,

Manu XI. 82, Yāj. III. 244, Sankha and Gaut, 22.9 lay down that if the murderer of a brāhmaṇa announces his sin when the king and priests have met together for the ceremonial bath after the Asvamedha sacrifice and being permitted by them bathes along with them, he becomes free from the sin.220 According to Haradatta this is an independent penance, while according to the Mit, on Yāj. III. 244, Aparārka p. 1057 and others it is not so but is to be performed while undergoing the 12 years' penance.

Yāj. III. 245 provides that if the murderer treats and cures a brāhmaṇa or a cow (or cows ) lying helpless on the public road suffering from a long-standing and serious ailment he becomes free from the sin.

Parāśara (XII. 65-67) prescribes for brahmahatyā the penance of going to the sea and Rāma's bridge, begging and declaring on the way one's sin, walking without an umbrella or shoes and residing in cowpens, forests, tirthas and river streams; on seeing the setu he was to bathe in the ocean and on return to feed brāhmaṇas at a dinner and to donate 100 cows to learned brāhmanas.

There are other penances for brahmahatyā mentioned by Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa and others quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1064-1065 ) and others which are passed over here for want of space.

If a brāhmana killed his own father, mother, full brother, his teacher of the Veda, a brāhmana who has studied the Veda or has consecrated sacred Vedic fires, he had to undergo penance till his last breath (acc. to Pr. Prakarana p. 13 quoting Bhavisya purāna, Pr. V. pp. 70-71, Smrtimuktāphala Pr. p. 873 quoting Daksa III, 27-28 and Āp. Dh. S. 1.9.24). If a man killed a priest that was engaged at a soma sacrifice the penance was double (Yāj. III. 252 ). The Pr. Prakarana (p.13) says that this means that the murderer should perform 12 years' penance and then donate cows 221 in proportion to the difference between his

age at the time of finishing twelve years and 120 years ( which is regarded as the highest limit of life ). If a person strikes a brāhmaṇa intending to kill him but only injures him he should perform the vrata for brahmahatyā (acc. to Yāj. III, 252, Gaut. 22.11). The Mit, explains that this is an extension (atideśa ) of the rules about brahmahatyā and so the penance is a little less than the full one (i. e. 9 years ). Where certain sins are said to be equal ( sama ) to brahmahatyā or surāpāna, the penance for them is half of what is prescribed for the latter. If a person intending to commit suicide by entering water or fire or by hanging himself or by taking poison or by falling from a precipice or the dome of a temple or by cutting his belly with a weapon or by fasting, does not die, but luckily lives, he has to undergo a prāya citta for three years (acc. to Pr. Prakarana p. 15). Vas. 23. 18-19 and Parāśara XII,5–8 prescribe other prāyaścittas for such persons (who are styled pratyavasita'). Pr. Prakaraņa (p. 15) and Pr. V. (p. 75 ) quote two verses of Yama 221a for nine kinds of pratyavasita and prescribe Cāndrāyaṇa or two Taptakịcchras for them. " If a ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra intentionally and directly killed a brāhmana, the expiation was death, but otherwise each had respectively to undergo twice, thrice or four times as much prāyaścitta as a brāhmaṇa sinner would have had to undergo for killing a brāhmaṇa,222 Conversely, if a brāhmaṇa killed a ksatriya or vaisya or a südra the sin was only an upapātaka (acc. to Yāj. III. 236 and Manu XI. 66), unless the ksatriya or vaisya victim was engaged in performing a soma sacrifice (Šāmavidhāna Br. I. 7.5, Yāj. III 251, Vas. 20. 34) when the penance was heavy. Yaj. III. 266-267, Manu XI, 126-130 and Āp. Dh. S. 1.9.24. 1-4 prescribe other penances for killing a kşatriya, a vaiấya or a südra. The penance for a ksatriya

Women victims were placed on the same footing as ksatriya, vaisya and śüdra males (Yāj. III, 236 and Manu XI. 66), except the cases where the woman was an Atreyi or pregnant or in her monthly illness (Gaut. 22.17, Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24,5 and 9, Baud. Dh. S.

The period of soma-yāga was reckoned from the Dikșanīyā isti to the Udavasānīyā (acc. to the Mit.) or up to the end of avabhịtha bath (acc. to Aparārka). For killing women guilty of adultery the penances were higher and varied according to the caste of the paramour and of the woman (vide Gaut. 22,26-27, Manu XI, 138, Yaj. III. 268-269).

Manu (XI. 208 =Vişņu Dh, S. 54,30) and Yaj. III. 293 prescribe that for threatening to beat or strike a brāhmaṇa the penance is kịcchra, for striking him it is Ati-krochra, for shedd ing his blood a Krcchra and Atikrochra. The Sāmavidhāna Br. 1.7. 4 prescribes other penances (i. e, recitation of certain sāman texts ) for these.

Gaut. 23,1, 22 Āp. Dh. S. 1. 9. 25,3, Baud. Dh, S. II. 1. 21., Vas. 20.22, Manu XI. 90-91, Yāj. III, 253 and Bphaspati prescribe that if a brahmana drinks intentionally spirituous liquor prepared from flour even once he has to undergo a pen ance that ends in death, viz, he has to drink that liquor boiling hot or to drink boiling hot cow's urine, milk, ghee, water or liquid cow-dung, and when his body has been completely scalded thereby and he dies he becomes free from that sin. Some like Haradatta on Gaut. 23. 1 hold that this horrible penance is meant for one who knowingly and repeatedly drinks surā (man ufactured from rice flour). Manu XI, 92 and Yaj. III. 254 prescribe another penance in place of the one ending in death viz. that the sinner should eat during one year (during three

Prāyaścittas for drinking liquor years, acc. to Yāj.) once (a day) at night the (boiled) small grains of rice, or oilcake, should wear clothes made of cow's hair, should have matted hair on his head and carry a flagstaff (with a wine cup thereon). The same rules apply to a ksatriya or vaisy a drinking surā (manufactured from rice flour). Only they have as stated above (in note 192) to undergo three-fourths and one-half respectively of the penance for a brāhmana sinner. This penance was to be undertaken after vomiting the contents of the stomach. According to the Madanapārijāta (p. 818), Pr. V. p. 104, Pr. Prakarana p. 43, Mit. (on Yāj. III. 24) and other works the twelve years' penance is meant for one who drinks surā (made from flour) through ignorance or force. According to Gaut. 23. 2-3, Yāj. III, 255, Manu. XI. 146, Atri 75, for drink ing intoxicants or human semen, ordure or urine through ignorance a person of the three first classes had first to undergo the penance called Taptakrcchra and then his upanayana was again performed. Vasistha 20.19 prescribes for drinking any intoxicant unintentionally the penances of Krcchra and Atikrochra, the drinking of ghee and the performing of upanayana again. There is great divergence of views about Manu XI. 146 and Yāj. III. 255 which is passed over here. Brhaspati 224 quoted by the Mit., Aparārka and others prescribes that a brāhmana who drinks surā prepared from raw sugar, flour and honey (or madhüka flowers ) should respectively undergo Taptakrcchra, Parāka and Candrāyana. This light penance is restricted acc. to the Mit, and others to cases where surā is drunk for curing a malady which no other medicine could cure. If a brāhmaṇa drank surā (not manufactured from flour ) or any other intoxicant, various easy penances were prescribed for him (such as undergoing Cāndrāyana on a river falling into the sea, feeding brāhmaṇas and donating a cow and a bull to the brāhmaṇas, Parāśara XII. 75-76). Vide Yāj. III. 255 and the Mit, thereon. Ksatriyas and vaisyas incurred no sin by drinking intoxicants other than surā (made from flour) and the sūdra incurred no sin even by drinking surā of the

paisti variety. The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 243 ) holds that since Manu XI. 93 generally forbids the drinking of surā on the part of brāhmanas, ksatriyas and vaiśyas the prohibi tion applies even to boys who have not undergone the rite of upanayana and girls who are not yet married and adds that for drinking surā the child has to undergo only one fourth penance (for 3 years ) if the offence was uninten tional and double of that (6 years) if it was intentional (vide also Pr. prakarana p. 48). The Kalpataru, it appears, held, relying on Gaut. II. 1 ('before upanayana a child may do as it pleases as regards behaviour, speech and eating '), that no sin (doşa) was incurred by a child before upanayana and by a girl before marriage for drinking surā. The Pr. V. (p. 104 ) and Pr. Prakāśa criticize the Kalpataru for this view.225 As Brhaspati states (vide n. 188 above ) the license allowed by Gautama is limited by the Mit. and other digests to the par taking of sour or stale drinks and the like and is not extended to drinking surā which is a mahāpātaka. Jātākarṇya 226 ( q. by the Par. M.) provides that if a boy whose upanayana has not been performed drinks an intoxicant (madya) through foolish ness, his father, mother or brother should perform three krcchras as an expiation for him. Angiras (Jiv. p. 557), Apastamba smrti III, 9, Laghu-Harita 34-35, Brhad-yama III. 1-2 also provide that a pratinidhi ( brother, father, friend ) may undergo an expiation for a boy who is himself unable to do so or is less than eleven and above five years of age.

The Asv. gr. (I. 22.22-26 )227 prescribes what is to be done and what is to be omitted in punar-upanayana. It provides that the rites of the cutting of the hair and the production of intellig ence are optional, there are no express rules about giving the person in charge (of the deities) and as to the time, and the verse to be recited as the Sāvitrī is Rgveda V. 82.1 instead of the usual Gāyatri (tatsavitur-varenyam, Rg. III. 62.10 ).

Rules about punar-upanayana

Vasistha 20.18 quotes Manu XI, 151 on this point 228 and Visnu (Dh, S. 51.4-5) in prose is to the same effect. Visnu (Dh. S' 51. 2-3 ) provides Cāndrāyana for drinking any of the twelve ) unclean excretions of the body (Manu V. 134 ) or any of the several kinds of intoxicating drinks and for eating garlic or onion or red garlic or any plant having a similar flavour or the flesh of village pigs, of tame cocks, of apes and of cows and then adds (in sütra 4) that they (the sinners ) must undergo fregh upanayana also. The smrtis provide different prāyaścittas for various lapses about drinking and eating such as drinking water from a pot which had already been used for holding surā, for drinking water from the water vessel of a candāla or of a washerman or from a südra's house or for drinking milk which should not be drunk (Gaut. 17.22-26, Yaj. I. 170, Manu V. 8-10), for eating forbidden food, which must be passed over here, because 229 they are too many and too various and depend on circumstances for their application as observed by the Pr. V. and because they are now of academic interest alone. Some reference, however, may be made to show how some of these lapses were treated. Sankha states that there are many articles that are allowed or forbidden to men, particularly to brahmanas and in cases of transgressions the decision rests with the sistas (the parisad of respectable people ). Brhaspati 230 (quoted by Aparārka) prescribes that in the case of the partaking of things that should not be licked or drunk or eaten or in case of taking in human semen, urine or ordure, the penance of a cāndrāyana is the purification. Some of the sages such as Samyarta, Sankha-likhita took a lenient view, prescribed Cândrāyana even for eating cow's flesh and human flesh. 231

The general rule stated by the Sāma. Br. 1. 5.13, Manu XI. 160 and others is that one desirous of inner purity should not eat forbidden food, that if he eats it through ignorance he should make efforts to vomit it and if that is impossible he should quickly take some prayascitta (which is slight in the case of ignorance ). It may be mentioned that even from very ancient times exceptions were recognised to the prohibitions against the partaking of forbidden food. The Chāndogya Upanişad (I. 10 )282 narrates the story of Usasti Cākrāyana, who when the country of the Kurus had been devastated by hailstones (or by locusts ), begged (along with his very young wife ) of a chief eating beans and took from the latter the beans that had been put away for the chief (and so were ucchista), but when asked to take water for drinking meant for the chief replied that if he drank of it he would be drinking what was unclean, since he could get water whenever he liked. This Vedic passage indicates that even unclean things may be eaten when there is distress (ūpad) or danger to life, but that when there is no distress or danger even one who has knowledge of brahmavidyā should not violate the injunctions of śāstra about eating. The Vedāntasūtra (III.4.28) has an aphorism on this incident. Manu X.104 provides that he who, when in danger of losing his life, accepts food from any person whatsoever is not tainted by sin as the sky is not tainted by mud. Manu then refers (X.105-108) to the stories of Ajigarta who, when famished, approached for slaying his own son, of the sage Vāmadeva who when tormented by hunger desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life and did not sully himself, of Bharadvāja who when distressed by hunger along with his son in a lonely forest accepted many cows from the carpenter Vrdhu (Brbu ? ) or of Viśvāmitra who, well knowing what was right or wrong, proceeded, when tormented by hunger, to eat the haunch of a dog, receiving it from the hands of a Candāla 232a

Prāyaścittas for other Mahāpātakas

101

For eating the flesh of various birds Visnu Dh. S. 51. 29 and 31 and others prescribe fasting for three days or one day and also for eating several varieties of fish (Visnu 51,21).

We may now revert to the penances for the other Mahā pātakas. It has already been seen how the thief that had stolen a brāhmana's gold of a certain weight was to approach the king with a club (p. 73 above). Even Ap. Dh, S. 19.25.4 refers to this and prescribes as an option (Ap. Dh. S. 1.9.25,6-7) entaring into fire as an expiation for theft or starving oneself by reducing the intake of food. Therefore, the penance for the theft of brāhmana's gold of the weight of 80 raktikūs or more (Manu VIII, 134 and Yāj. 1.363) was death for the offenders of all varnas, except a brāhmaṇa offender, who clad in rags (or bark. garment) was to undergo a penance in a forest for twelve years of the same kind as for brāhmana murder (Manu XI. 101 ) or for the drinking of surā prepared from flour (Yāj. TIL. 258 ). The offender may also give as much gold (if he is rich) as his own weight or as much wealth as would be required for the maintenance of a brahmana's family for the latter's lifetime (Yāj. III. 258 and Mit. thereon). The Āp. Dh. S. I. 9.25.8 provides the observance of the penance of Krechra for one year (as defined in Ap. Dh. S. I. 9.27.7-8) and quotes a verse "those who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous liquor, or had connection with a guru's wife, but not those who have slain a brāhmana, shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe thrice a day, pass the day standing and the night sitting; after the lapse of three years they cast off their sins."2328 The digests contain numerous and varying expiations for theft depending upon the weight of gold stolen, upon the qualities of the man robbed and of the thief, upon the caste of both upon whether it is a first offence or a repeated one, on the price and nature of the thing stolen and on the time and place and so on. Vide Pr. V. pp. 117-127, Pr. Sāra p. 49. Madanapārijāta pp. 828-834, Smrtyarthasāra pp. 108-109, Smrtimuktāphala pp. 883-885. These have to be passed over here for reasons of space.

If the gold stolen (even from a brāhmana) was less than 80 raktikās or if gold of any weight was stolen from a ksatriya

or any other non-brāhmaṇa, the expiation would be as one for an upapātaka. Manu (XI. 162-168 =Matsyapurāna 227. 41-47) and Visnu 52. 5-13 prescribe various penances such as krochra for a year for the theft of corn or cooked food or wealth; cāndrāyaṇa for abducting men and women (slaves ) or for appropriating a field or house and the water of wells and cisterns; sāntapana for thefts of objects of small value; pañcâgavya for stealing eatables of various kinds or a vehicle or a bed or a seat or flowers or roots and fruits; fasting for three days and nights in the case of theft of grass, wood, trees, dry food, molasses, clothes, leather (or armour) and flesh; subsisting for twelve days on small grains of rice for stealing gems, pearls, coral, copper, silver, iron, bell-metal or stones; subsisting on milk alone for the theft of cotton, silk, wool, animals with cloven hoofs (cows &c.) or uncloven hoofs (horses &c.), birds, perfumes, medicinal herbs or a rope (used for drawing water). It must be remembered as stated above (p. 74) that the thief had to restore to the owner the thing stolen and then undergo a penance (Manu XI.164 and Visnu Dh. S. 52.14) and Medhātithi (on Manu XI. 164) adds that if he is unable to restore the thing (or its price) the penance is to be double. Besides, in certain cases of theft if corporal punishment or death was not inflicted by the king, the thief was fined eleven times the price of the thing stolen (Manu VIII, 321, 323, Vişnu Dh. S. 5.82 ).233

Steya (theft) is of two kinds, by force (such as robbery and dacoity and called sāhasa ) and by clandestine means. In the former case the penance goes on increasing (twice, thrice) according as the offender is a ksatriya or vaisya ( parşadyā brāhmanānām, quoted above, Par. M. II part 1 p.231). In the case of theft by clandestine means if the owner whose gold or wealth is stolen is a brāhmana and the thief a ksatriya or vaisya, then also the penance must be higher than for a brāhmana thief (since, as, Nārada says in his chapter on sāhasa verse 16, the wealth belonging to idols, brāhmanas and kings is the best). But conversely, if the owner of stolen property is of lower class than the thief then the verse of Brhad-Vişnu ( 'vipre tu sakalam deyam,' quoted above in note 192) will apply.

Penance for incest

103

The penance for incest with the guru's wife was prescribed from very ancient times as follows: Gaut. 234 23, 8-11, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 9.25. 1-2, Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 14-16 (almost in the same words as in Gaut), Vas, 20, 13-14, Manu XI. 103-104 prescribe that the offender shall confess his guilt and then extend himself on a red-hot iron bed or embrace the red-hot iron image of a woman or having himself cut off his organ and testicles and having taken them in his joined hands may walk straight towards the south or south-west until he falls down dead and that he becomes purified by death. According to the Mit on Yāj. III. 259 the three are not distinct penances, but that two of them. viz, embracing the red-hot iron image of a woman and sleeping on a bed of red hot iron form one penance. The words of Yāj. no doubt convey that the two together are one penance ( viz. sleeping on red hot bed and clinging to a red hot image ). Others like the Madanapārijāta (p. 837), Medhātithi 235 on Manu XI. 103 do not accept this interpretation. The latter moreover relies on Gautama who employs the word 'vā' (or) in the two latter of his three sütras on this point. The Pr. V. (p. 138) points out this difference between Gaut. and Yāj. Manu XI. 58 and 170-71, Yāj. III. 231, Samyarta 159 regard sexual intercourse with a friend's wife or a maiden of a higher caste and the wives of one's son or of sagotras and women born of the same womb (sister &c.) or with an antyaja woman as equal to gurutal pagamana and the penance is only a little less than for the latter. Manu XI. 105 and Yāj. III. 260 prescribe a penance (other than one ending in death), viz. that the sinner should dwell in a tenantless forest, allow his beard to grow, should wear tattered garments and practise Prājāpatya Křochra for one year (three years acc. to Yāj.). The commentators say that this was meant where the sin was committed by mistake, Manu XI. 106 and Yāj. III. 260 provide another penance viz. Cândrāyana for three months, Manu prescribing that the sinner should subsist on sacrificial food (fruits, roots or nīvāra grain) or on barley gruel and Yăj, adding that he should recite for the three months the Vedasamhita. The commentators say that this applies in cases where the guru's wife is of a lower varna or of the sūdra class,

Parāśara (X. 10-11) provides three different prāyaścittas, viz. excision of the organ, three krcchras or three cândrāyanas if a man commits incest with his mother, sister, or daughter and in

X. 12-14 prescribes other penances for adultery with other near female relatives. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 259 quotes Sankha for twelve years' penance for all four kinds of Mahāpātakas, which applies acc. to it to intercourse with guru's wife of the same class. It is not necessary to quote further smrti passages which vary greatly as to the extent of the penance. Manu XI. 178 ( = Visyu Dh. S. 53. 9 = Agnipurāna 169.41), Santi 165. 29 state that the sin which a twice-born man com mits by sexual intercourse for one night with a vrşali 236 (a cāņdāla woman) is removed by him by the penance of subsist ing on alms for three years and reciting mantras (like the Gayatri). Ap. Dh. S, I. 9. 27. 11 has a somewhat similar verse about a brāhmana's intercourse with a sūdra woman237 Yāj. III. 233 prescribes for women death as a legal penalty and the same prāyascitta as for a male if a man has sexual intercourse with his paternal or maternal aunt, or daughter-in-law, maternal uncle's wife and others (enumerated above) with their consent. Manu XI, 175 ( = Laghu - Sātātapa 155 = Agnipurāna 169. 38) holds that a brāhmana, who has sexual intercourse with a candāla woman or mleccha woman or dines with cāņdālas or mlecchas or accepts gifts from them, has to perform penance as if he were patita if he unknowingly did these things, and be comes like them by committing these sins knowingly.

If a woman be guilty of a Mahāpātaka the general rule stated by Manu XI, 176 (latter half), Kātyāyana and Brhaspati238 was that whatever penance was prescribed for a male in cases of adultery with other's wives the same was to be adminis tered to women in case of adultery with males. In this parti

Prāyaścitta for adultereds

105

cular case the rule about half penance being prescribed for women did not hold good when a woman with full knowledge committed adultery and half penance was to be prescribed only where the adultery was through mistake. A similar rule was laid down by Angiras 238a If a woman became patita and did not undergo prayascitta she could be excommunicated by the process called ghatasphota (described in H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 615-616 and 1009). But there was a difference between a male and a woman in this respect. A woman, however, was not to be altogether abandoned on the street and left to fare for herself, though she be patita, but she was to be lodged in a cottage thatched with grass near the house and was to be guarded against further lapses and given bare maintenance ( enough to keep body and soul together) and (dirty ) clothes (Yāj. III. 296, Manu XI. 176). There were certain acts, however, which were specially condemned in women (Yāj. III. 297) viz. sexual intercourse with a man of a lower class, causing abortion and killing the husband. Vas, 21. 10 provides 239 that four classes of women may be altogether abandoned (and not given even starving maintenance &c.) viz, a woman who has sexual intercourse with (her husband's) pupil or with his guru or one who kills her husband or one who sexually approaches a man of a lower degraded class. Women, however patita they may be, were to be dealt with as stated in Yāj. III. 296 even if they did not perform any penance. Vas. 21.12 states that women of the brāhmana, ksatriya and vajśya classes, if guilty of sexual intercourse with a südra, can be purified by penanoe if they do not give birth to a child, but not those others (who give birth to a child born of the condemned connection). Vide H. of Dh VO). III. pp. 946-949 for penance and other matters in relation to adultery by men and women,

It is now necessary to turn to the penance for association with those that are guilty of grave sins (mahāpātakas). Manu XI, 181, Vişnu Dh. S. 54.1, Yāj. III. 261 provide that whoever associates with (for a year, acc. to Yāj.) a person guilty of one

of the four mahāpātakas has to undergo the vrata (the observ ances) prescribed for that grave sinner in order to free himself from the sin of association. Kullūka, the Pr. sāra (p. 61) and others state that the penance here referred to is the one for twelve years and not death since it is the word vrata that is employed by Manu and vrata does not ordinarily convey the idea of death,240 If the association was due to ignorance the penance was half. Vyāsa prescribed 211 for the knowing associator ths of the penance provided for the sinner himself. According to the Pr. V. (p. 171 ) there was no difference in the extent of the penance for association with a sinner in the case of a brāhmana 242 and a sūdra, though in other cases penance was reduced by one quarter for each varpa. If the association was for less than one year, then the penance was proportionately reduced. Not only was the patita condemned but even his son born after he became patita and he was excluded from inheritance. But the daughter of a patita was treated differently and she could be married without any stigma being attached to the husband. Vide Vas. 13.51-53, Yāj. III, 261, Baud, Dh. S. II. 1. 73–74, Hārita q. by Pr. V. p. 174 and Pr. prakarana p. 110 and H, of Dh, vol. III. pp. 614-616.

Vişnu Dh. S. (chap. 36) speaks of certain sins as anupātakas which are declared by Manu ( XI. 55-58) and Yāj. (III. 228-233) to be equal to or like one or other of the mahāpātakas and provides that those guilty of them become pure by Aśvamedha sacrifice or by resorting to pilgrimages. It has also been seen that such sins are removed by the penances that are slightly less (i, e. by 4th ) than those for the mahāpātakas themselves.

The penances for upapātakas must now be briefly dealt with. The number of upapātakas is very large and it is of no practical importance to deal with each of them separately. First of all, some general rules about them will be stated and

a few of them that are of some importance will be dealt with individually. The Sāmavidhāna 243 Br. (I, 5.14) states that on committing several upapātakas a man becomes pure by reciting thrice the whole of the veda while fasting. Manu XI, 117, Yāj. III, 265, Visnu Dh. S. 37,35 prescribe that purification from all classes of upapātakas (except the sin of the avakirnin) is effected by the same penances that are prescribed for govadha or by cāndrāyana or by subsisting on milk alone for a month or by Parāka or Gosava. The digests prescribe that Parāka is meant for him who is strong enough to undertake it, Cāndrāyaṇa for him who is weak, Gosava for him who repeatedly commits the same upapātaka or is guilty of several at the same time ( vide Pr. Prakāśa, folio 122 a).

Govadha stands at the head of upapātakas in Manu, Yāj., the Agnipurāņa (168. 29-37). Several smrtis provide different penances for the sin of killing a cow. Gaut. 22. 18 prescribes 244 the same penance for govadha as for killing a vaisya (Gaut. 22. 15) viz. staying for three years in a forest, subsisting on alms, observing celibacy and donating, one hundred cows toge ther with a bull. In Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 26. 1 for killing a milch cow or a full grown ox the penance is said to be the same as for killing a sūdra. Vas. 21. 18 provides that if a man kills a cow he should cover himself with the raw hide of the cow (that is killed) and should observe Kịcchra or Atikrochra for six months, Manu 245 XI, 108-116, Visnu Dh. S. 50. 16-24, Sam varta 130-135, Parāśara VIII. 31-41 (q. in Smrtimuktāphala p. 875, prāyaścitta section) prescribə elaborate observances as penances for govadha. Yāj. (III. 263-264) provides four sepa rate prāvascittas, viz (1) the killer of a cow should control his senses for a month, should subsist on pañcagavya (cow's urine, Cow-dung, milk, curds and ghee), should sleep in a cowpen, should follow the cows so penned (by day) and at the end of a month donate a cow; (2) or he should perform Krochra penance while sleeping in a cow-pen and following cows by day; (3) or should perform an atikṛcchra in the same way; (4) or should fast for three days and donate ten cows together with

Sankha provides 216 that the killer of a cow should fast for 25 days and nights subsisting on pañcagavya, should tonsure his head together with the top-knot, should wear as an upper garment cow-hide and should follow cows, lie down in a cow-pen and donate a cow. Some of the smrtis and digests declare that the penance differed according as the cow that was killed belonged to a learned brāhmana or to a mere brāhmana by caste, to a ksatriya or vaisya or Sudra. For example, Devala (q. by Pr. V. p. 202) states that if a cow belonging to a brāh mana were killed, then the sinner should wear as upper garment that cow's hide for six months, should bring fodder for cows, should imitate cows, should subsist on barley gruel, should move among cows and then he becomes free from the sin. Šātātapa (q. by Pr. V. p. 203) states that one killing the cow of a vaisya

uld subsist on pañcagavya for a month, should recito the Tomati-vidya247 and stay in a cowpen for a month,Visva mitra (Pr. V. p. 203) says about the killer of a cow belonging to a śūdra that he should undergo four kịcchras if he kills intentionally and two if unintentionally. The Gomati-vidyā as quoted by Aparārka (p. 1102), the Madana-pārijāta (p. 862) and Pr. T. p. 522 (which takes it from the Prāyaścitta section of the Kalpataru that takes it from Yama) is a laudation of cows: 'cows always emit fragrance, they have the smell of guggulu (bdellium), they are the support of beings, they are a great blessing; cows are (yield in their milk) the best food and the best offerings for gods; they are purifiers of all beings and offerings ooze from them; they please the gods in heaven by the offerings (of milk and ghee) that are rendered pure by the mantras recited over them ; in the agnihotra (keeping up the sacred fire) of sages cows help

Brāhmaṇas and cows are really ) one family divided into two parts, in one (brāhmaṇas) reside the (vedic) mantras and in the other reside offerings (to Gods of ghee &c.:)." The Pr. prakarana 218 (p. 33) says that Katyāyana, Gautama, Samyarta, Parāśara and other sages prescribə differing penances for govadha, which are to be explained away by reference to the killing being intentional or unintentional or to the fact of the cow being owned by a brāhmapa engaged in a soma sacrifice or by a brāhmaṇa who has studied the Veda with the six auxiliary śāstras, or by the fact that the cow was useful for the homa of a brāhmana possessed of good qualities or was a pregnant cow or of the kapilā (brown or tawny) variety. It adds the important statement that in its days such cows being not found in ordinary life it is not necessary to expressly assign to each of those texts its appropriate subject matter,

Yāj. III. 284, 249 Samvarta 137, Agnipurāņa 169,14 provide that if a cow or bull dies while being treated with medicine or while an attempt is being made to help the cow in delivery, or being branded (as a treatment) there is no sin. This applies as an exception in all cases of injury or death of brāhmaṇas, cows or other animals. Parāśara (IX, 4 ff.) and Angiras (q. by Pr. T. pp. 526-527) prescribe , and of the prāyaścitta for killing out-right a cow, if the death is due to putting an obstacle in the cow's or bull's free movement or to tying it up or to yoking it with thongs. Before undergoing a penance for govadha, the sinner had to make good the price of the animal to the owner, according to the Brahmapurana and Parāśara. 250

The Sāmavidhāna Br. (I. 7.8.) prescribes that on killing any animal (except a cow or bull) the guilty person should fast for one night and recite the sāmave da verse 'Agnis-tigmena' (1. 1. 3. 2). Āp. Dh. S. (1. 9.25.14) provides for killing a crow, a chameleon, a peacock, a chakravāka, hamsa, bhāsa, a frog, ichneumon, musk-rat, a dog the same penance as for killing a südra. Gaut. 22. 19-22, 24-25, Manu XI. 133-137, Yāj. III. 269-274, Visnu Dh. S. 50.25–32, Parāśara VI. 1-15 prescribe several penances for killing an elephant, a horse, a tiger, a monkey, a cat, a serpent and numerous other animals, which are passed over here. Some smrtis such as Samvarta 10 and Paithīnasi make a difference between grāmya and āranya (forest) animals, in each class seven being specificed by Paithinasi.251 The great concern of the sages for anything possessed of the principle of life or growth went so far as to prescribe the penance of reciting one hundred yk verses if a man cut off big trees (like mango or jack-fruit tree) or shrubs and creepers, except for purposes of sacrifices or agriculture 252 (Manu XI. 142, Yāj. III, 276, Vas. 19. 11-12). These provisions tended against wanton destruction of trees, shrubs and forests that are so beneficent to humanity and lend a charm to the landscape,

It is remarkable that in case a man was bitten by a harlot or a monkey or an ass or by a dog or jackal or a camel or a crow he had to perform in addition to the pain of the bite) prānāyāma while standing in water and to drink ghee for purification (Manu XI. 199, Yāj. III. 277, Vas. 23. 31). Parāśara V. 1-9 prescribe elaborate rules of purification for bites by wolves, dogs and jackals (such as a bath and japa of Gāyatri &c.).

PARADARYA (adultery with another's wife)-is a minor sin (acc. to Yāj. III, 235, Manu XI, 59). This excludes inter course with guru's wife and other intercourse declared to be like gurutal pagamana or with candāla women (Manu XI, 170-172, 175, 178, Yaj. III, 231-233, Vas. XX, 15-17 and XXIII, 41). Ap. Dh. S. I. 10.28.19 is very severe on a male adulterer who trans gresses his vow of loyalty to his wife; one who proves false to his wife shall put on the skin of an ass with the hair turned

outside and beg at seven houses saying 'give alms to him who played false to his wife'. This should be his livelihood for six months”. Conversely, Āp. (I. 10.28.20) provides that if a wife plays false to her husband she should perform for as many months (i. e, six months) the twelve night krochra penance, In another place Āp. Dh. S. (IL. 10. 27. 11) states that if a brāhmana commits adultery once with a married woman of equal class he shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for an outcast. Gaut. (22. 29-30, 34) provides penances for two years generally and three years if the woman be the wife of a learned brāhmana. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 265 quotes numerous texts dealing with the penance for adultery that does not amount to a mahāpātaka and tries to evolve order by assigning to each its proper province. This is passed over here. A woman guilty of adultery with a male of the same or higher caste than herself had to undergo the same penance as a male adulterer (Manu XI. 176 and Brhaspati), but if she committed adultery with a male of lower caste, then the penances differed as stated above (vide Vas. 21, 1-5 and Samvarta 167–172 ). Brhadyama IV. 48 states that adultery in the inverse order of classes is a grave sin, but adultery in the anuloma order of classes entails different penances for purification from it.253

The penances also such as the performance of Vrātyastoma and Uddalakavrata (Vas XI. 76-79, Gaut. 19.8) are prescribed by some of these works, while Manu XI. 191 (=Visņu Dh, S. 54, 26-27 = Agni purāna 170.8-9) prescribes a milder penance of three krcchras and then Upanayana is to be performed again. Vas, XI. 77 describes Uddalakavrata as follows: 'for two months he should subsist on barley gruel, for a month on milk, for half a month on āmiksā, for eight days on ghee, for six days on food obtained without begging or asking for it, for three days on water and he should observe a complete fast for one day.'

The former states that the Pasupurodāsa may be offered to Rakşas or to Yama or he may offer on the Amāvāsyā at night two offerings of clarified butter in fire after performing the preparatory ritəs of a darvi homa and that he may then invoke fire with the verse (Tai.

The pratyavasitas are said to be of nine kinds 258 by Yama (22-23), Bșhad-Yama (3-4) and others viz. those who turn back from water, fire, halter by means of which they wanted to kill themselves), those who revert back from the stage of sannyāsa or from a fast (unto death), or from poison, precipice or sitting dharnā and those who (desiring to commit suicide) strike themselves with a weapon (but are not killed); these nine are called pratyavasita and are beyond commerce with people, become pure by the penance of Cândrāyana or two Taptakrcchras. Vrddha-Parāśara quoted by Par. M. and Prāyaścitta-inuktāvali provides that sannyasins, who revert to the life of the householder, are to be treated as cā ndālas even after undergoing penance and their children born after they fall from the ascetic stage are to be made to dwell among cāndālas. This explains the harsh treatment alleged to have been meted to the great saint Jñānośvara and his brothers at Paithan in the 13th century. A person who after becoming a sannyāsin reverts to another āśrama or acts contrary to the

rules of his āśrama is called ārūąhapatita also (vide Par. M. II. part. I. p. 373 quoting Hārīta).

Elaborate purifications are prescribed for removing the taint of touching certain men, unclean objects like bones (Manu V. 87), women in their monthly illness or within certain days after delivery and animals (like dogs, village pigs, cocks, crows ). They have to be passed over here for reasons of space. But a few passages may be cited by way of sample. Gautama 259 (14.28) provides that on touching patita, cāndala, a woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpse, or on touch ing any one who has touched any one of these or any one who is the third in contact, the purification is brought about by a bath with the clothes on. Manu V. 84 and Yāj. III. 30 contain similar provisions. The Pr. V. (pp. 495-499) discusses the question whether sparsa 260 (touch) means direct touch or includes even indirect touch and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that indirect touch also is included and cites āpastamba-smrti in support that if a brāhmana and a cândāla or the like are both seated on the same branch (without actually touching each other) the brāhmana can become purified only by a bath. A verse quoted as Yājñavalkya's by Pr. Prakaraņa 261 p. 110 (not found in the printed text) states: ‘on touching a cāņdāla, pukkaga, mleccha, bhilla, a pārasika (one coming from Persia) and the like and persons guilty of grave sins one should bathe with the clothes on.' The Şat-trimsan-mata262 provides 'on touching

IV1 Bath for touching certain persons Bauddhas, Pāśupatas, Laukāyatikas, atheists and those who follow forbidden actions, one should plunge in water together with the clothes on. On touching a caitya tree (such as a fig tree round which a platform is built), a funeral pile (or brick altar prepared in the frauta rite called Agnicayana), a sacrificial post, a cândāla, one who sells the soma plant, a brāhmapa should enter water with the clothes on.' Samvarta 263 requires a dvija to sip water on touching a shoemaker, a washerman, a veņa (Manu X. 19, 49, one who beats drum &c.), a fisherman, a dancer (nata) and Sātātapa 264 provides that if any limb of a dvija (except the head) is touched by one who colours clothes, a shoemaker, a hunter, a fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a thaka (Thug), an actor, one who allows sexual intercourse in the mouth, a dog, a prostitute allowing men of all varnas to visit her, an oil-grinder, the keeper of a tavern, an executioner, a village pig or cock, he should wash the limb with water and perform ācamana. If the head is touched by any one of these, then he should bathe. In this connection it may be noted that Hemādri quotes (on p. 38) the Garudapurāna and (on p. 316) Parāśara for the 16 castes in a village that were treated as cāndālas in the matter of touch, speech or sight. Devala (q. by Hemādri on prāyaścitta p. 312) says that Cāndāla and Turuska (Turk) are equally low. The chapter on untouchables in the 2nd vol. of the H. of Dh. pp. 165-179 may be consulted in this connection. On pp. 175-176 of the same work references are given to verses of Atri, śātātapa, Bphaspati and others stating that no purification is required on the ground of untouchability in the case of religious festivals and marriage processions, in battle, in the case of fire or invasion and similar calamities. By no stretch of imagination can these verses be restricted to the untouchability arising from death or birth as some propose

to do. The words are too sweeping for this explanation and there being no untouchability on birth for any one except the mother and persons in mourning not being likely to join religious festivals and marriage processions those verses cannot be so construed.

The smrtis were very keen on keeping a high ideal before brāhmaṇas as regards receiving gifts. The Sāma. Br. (1.7.1-2) prescribes that if a brāhmana receives a gift from a ksatriya when not in distress (or difficulty) he should eat only one ineal by day for a month and recite the Sama verse 'mahat tat somo mahisascakāra' (Sāmaveda I. 6.1.5, 10, No. 542) for one month, while standing in water and if he accepts a gift from any one else from whom he should not accept it, he should undergo krochra penance and recite the sāma verse "trikadrukesu' (Samaveda 1.5.2.3.1, No. 457). Yāj. I. 140 provides that a brahmana should not accept a gift from a king who is parsimon ious (or greedy) and acts against the dictates of śāstra and Manu XI. 194 (=Vispu Dh. S. 54.24) provides that a brāhmana becomes free from the sin of the acceptance of a thing which should not be accepted or of the acceptance of a gift from a condemned donor by reciting the Gāyatri three thousand times (in a month) or subsisting on milk alone or staying in a cowpen for a month. It may be noted that Manu X. 102-103 and Yāj. III, 41 allow a brāhmaṇa when in distress to accept a gift from anybody or to take food from anyone whatever or to maintain himself by teaching any one whatever and state that he is not tainted by sin in so doing, since he is like fire and water (like that of the Ganges) and since it is unreasonable ( or impossible ) to assert that what is pure can be sullied. Manu X. 109, however, regards acceptance of a gift from an unworthy (or low) person as worse than teaching an improper person or officiating for him. A brāhmaṇa was not to sell things declared to be unfit to be sold by him such 264 a as sesame, oil of sesame, curds, bees' wax (ksaudra), salt, grapes, wine, cooked food, female or

Penance for selling certain things

male slaves, elephants, horses, bulls, fragrant substances, liquids, silken cloth (ksauma), black antelope hide, soma plant, water, in digo; by selling these he at once incurs sin. As penance he should practise Tapta-lercchra for a year after tonsuring his head, he should enter water thrice, wear only one wet piece of cloth, should observe silence, should practise the Virāsana, should sit up at night and stand by day, should recite the Gāyatri.

One important matter dealt with by a few of the smrtis and some of the digests is the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those who were converted by force by the invading mlecchas. About the meaning of the word mleccha, there is some diver gence of views. From the Sat. Br. (III. 2.1. 23-24) it appears that the mlecchas spoke a degraded and corrupt speech (such as saying 'helavah' for 'hesrayaḥ'). Parāśara (IX. 36) refers to the mlecchas as the eaters of cow's flesh. The Pr. T. (p. 549) quotes a smrti 265 text to the effect that a mleccha is an eater of cow's flesh and talks much that is contradictory, and cites a passage from the Harivamśa for the manner of the dress and of the trimming of hair in the case of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas. Pāradas, Pahlavas &c. Vide for mleccha and for the return to the Hindu fold of those that were forcibly carried away as slaves by mlecchas and robberg or made to kill cows or to eat the flesh of asses, camels, village pigs, H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 92, 383–385. 389-392 (where verses of Devala ascribed by some like the Mit. to Apastamba-smrti are set out), 973-974. A few matters not, dealt with there may be added here. The Vispudharmottara 266 purana (II. 73.203-206) provides that when persons are kid. napped by mlecchas or raiders or persons passing through forests are so treated and return to their own country, the penances for purifying them from the sin of eating forbidden food are to be prescribed after considering their class (varna), viz. that a

brahmana should undergo half krcchra penance and should have the Upanayana performed again, a ksatriya should undergo three-fourths of Krechra (and also upanayana), a vaisya one fourth Krechra and a śūdra becomes pure by undergoing only 1 of a kịcchra and by making a gift. In view of the fact that Manu VIU, 169, Vispu Dh. S. VII. 6-7, Yāj. II. 89 declare that what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force and what is caused to be written by force and all transactions whatever that are brought about by force are void, and the burning desire of many people forcibly converted in times of disturbances to return to the Hindu fold and to the religion of their forefathers, the movement now called suddhi should be encouraged by all interested in the well-being and stability of Hindu society. It is better to call this return by the name of 'parāvartana'. A model but brief rite for the parāvartana of those who were forcibly converted or for those who voluntarily left the Hindu fold but want to return to it is given in the Appendix. The same prayoga with suitable changes may be employed for taking into the Hindu fold any one who was not born a Hindu. In ancient times such people appear to have been taken into the Hindu fold by the perfor mance of Vrūtyastoma. For this latter, vide H, of Dh, vol. II pp. 385-387 and for the spread of Hinduism in Java, Bali, Sumatra, Siam and other countries of South-East Asia, vide H, of Dh, vol. III, pp. 934-935. Recently, through the kindness of Dr. J. M. Unvala, I had an opportunity of reading several inscriptions of the 18th and 19th centuries at the fire temple called Jvālāji at Suruhani near Baku, the capital of Russian Azerbaijan, situated on the northern shore of the Caspian sea, which were inscribed by Hindu pilgrims or visitors, that begin with obeisance to Ganeśa and in one of which occurs the verse quoted below. 267

Manu XI. 124 (= Vişnu Dh. S. 38.7) prescribes the pon ance of Sāntapana for committing with full knowledge any of the deeds described above as jūtibhramsakara and the penance of Prājāpatya for doing it unintentionally. For doing any of the deeds called sankarikarana or apātrikarana described above, Manu XI. 125 prescribes the penance of candrāyana for a month and for doing any of the deeds called malāvaha prescribes that the perpetrator should scald himself with barley gruel for three

days. Those two verses of Manu occur in Agnipurāna (170. 23–25). Visnu Dh. S. (39.2, 40.2, 41.5) prescribes somewhat different penances for sankarikarana, apātrikarana or malini karaniya deeds. Vide also the Mit, on Yāj. III. 290 for the penances prescribed for these deeds by Yama and Brhaspati. About miscellaneous pūtakas the rule laid down by Manu XI. 209. Visnu Dh. S. 42.2, Yāj. III. 294 and others is that the penance should be prescribed by the brāhmaṇas after taking into account the nature of the deed, the ability of the perpetrator and other circumstances of time and place &c.

Some of the digests prescribe certain times for the perform ance of periance. The first rule is laid down by Hārīta that having done something sinful or improper through trustfulness, affection, greed, fear or heedlessness one should resort to puri-- fication at once. Daksa 268 II. 73 also states that all nai mitlika and kāmya matters must be performed as they fall due and no delay should be caused. If more than a year is allowed to pass after the sin is incurred the penance would have to be double of what it otherwise would have been, according to Devala and Manu.268a The Pr. T. (pp. 474, 512) quotes a verse from the Vyavahāra cintāmani 269 and an astrological work to the effect that a penance or ordeal should not be administered on the 8th or 14th tithi of a month, nor should an ordeal or marriage take place on a Saturday or Tuesday. The Prayascittendusekhara (p. 15) says that according to respectable people (sistas) the sankal pa (declaration of undergoing a penance) should be made on the 14th tithi and the actual rite should be performed on the amīvāsyā. If the guilty person is in mourning he may perform penance after the period of mourning is over.

The procedure for undergoing penances for sins and lapses prescribed by the assembly of learned men has varied in details from time to time. The Gaut. Dh, S. 26.6-17 prescribes

the method of performing Krochra penance. It is briefly as follows: The sinner desiring to be free of sin quickly should stand by day and sit up by night (i. e. should take sleep in a sitting position and not lie down), he should speak the truth and should not hold conversation with anāryas (südras &c.), should bathe thrice in the day, should perform mārjana (splash ing or sprinkling water on the head and other limbs by means of kuśas dipped in water after repeating sacred mantras) with the three verses 'apo hi sthā' (Rg. X.9.1-3), with the verses called Pavitravati and with the eight verses beginning with ‘hiranyayarņāh śucayah pāvakāh'(TaiS. V. 6.1.1-8). Then he should perform the tar pana 270 (satiating with water) with thirteen mantras beginning with namaḥ and ending with namah (each respectively containing 6, 4, 4, 13, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 2, 2, 6, 2 names of deities). This constitutes for him the worship of Aditya (the Sun) and he offers oblations of clarified butter with these thirteen mantras and, after he passes twelve days in this way, on the 13th he offers nine oblations of boiled rice to Agni, Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, the Visce Devas, Brahman, Prajāpati, Agni Svistakrt. Then he serves dinner to brāhmanas. The Āp. Dh. S. II, 6.15.9 states 271 the general rule that in all religious observances one should give dinner to brāhmanas that are pure (in conduct) and that have studied the Veda. The Baud. Dh. S. (II. I. 95-99) prescribes that in a kṛcchra penance one has to bathe thrice in the day, to lie down on the ground (not on a cot &c.), to wear only one piece of cloth, to shave one's hair on the head, the moustache and the body and to pare one's nails, and that the same mode is prescribed also for women (sinners) except the tonsure of the head. Manu (XI. 222-225 ) prescribes that in all penances there is homa with the mahāvyāhrtis every day, the sinner has to practise ahimsā (non-injury to all sentient beings), truthfulness, absence of anger and straight forwardness, has to bathe thrice by day and thrice by night together with the clothes on, he should not talk with women, südras and patitas, he should stand by day and sit down at night or if unable to do so he should sleep on the ground (raised platform called sthandila), should observe celibacy and the rules of a student, such as wearing girdle of muñja grass and carrying a staff (of palāśa &c.), should honour gods, brāhmanas and his status elders, should always recite the Gayatri and sacred texus

Procedure of penances.

Vas. 24,5 (a long prose passage) contains similar provisions. Yaj. III, 312-13 are very important. They prescribe the practice of certain virtues and rules of conduct called yamas (such as brahmacarya, kindliness, forbearance, truthfulness, ahiṁsā &c.) and niyamas (such as bath, silenca, fasting, purity of body &c.) as necessary adjuncts in all penances. The Laugaksigrhya (V. 3-11) prescribes the procedure for all penances. Yāj. III. 325 holds that one should, while performing the penance of krochra or cândrāyana, bathe thrice daily, recite holy mantras (as stated in Vas, 28.11-15) and should eat balls of rice over which the Gāyatri has been recited. Sankha272 (18,12-14) also summarises the different items that have to be gone through in undergoing a penance. The Madanapārijāta (pp. 781-784), Pr. V. (pp. 503 506), Pr, Sāra (pp 21,22 and 200-203), Pr. T. pp. 497-510, 523-524, Pr. Mayūkha pp. 18-21, Pr. Prakāśa (folios 38b to 43b), Prāyascittendusekhara (pp. 15 and 88) and other works provide elaborate rules about the procedure of undergoing prāyaścittas. It is not possible nor necessary to set out these in detail here. Briefly put, on the day previous to the actual day of commencing penance the sinner should pare his nails, shave his head, bathe with clay, cow-dung, holy water &c., drink clarified butter, make a declaration of performing the penance indicated by the assembly of learned men. On the next day he should bathe, perform śrāddha, drink pañcagavja, should perform homa, give dakşiņā (gold, cows &c.) to the brāhmaṇas and feed them. Parāśara (XI. 3) says that at the end of the rite of penance pañca gavya should be taken and one, two, three or four cows should be donated respectively by a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaisya and a südra. Yama (verse 63) says that brāhmanas should be fed on the performance of a penance and a daksiņā of one golden māsa should be given to each brāhmana. Jābāli says that at the beginning and close of all penances the sinner should offer in the smārta fire oblations of clarified butter to the accompani ment of the Vyāhrtis, perform srāddha and offer daksinā con gisting of a cow or gold. Vide Aparārka (p. 1230) and Par. M IT part 2 p. 195 for Jābāli's verses. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 30a) adds that according to the Mahārnava the number of vyāhrti-homas should be 28 or 108,

A few words may be said about the tonsure of the head (vapana or mundana). The Tai. Br. (I.5.6.1-2) states273 : . The Asuras first shaved the hair on the head, then the moustache and then the armpits; therefore they went down (or with face down wards) and were defeated, while the gods first shaved the armpits, then the moustache and then the hair on the head.' The Pr. Prakāśa quotes this passage in a mutilated form and then states that vapana is of three kinds, daiva (of the gods ), āsura (of the asuras) and manusa (of men), that the lasura method is condemned, that in consecrating the Vedic fires, in the ištis and soma sacrifices the daiva method is ordained, while in prāyaścittas, there being no special vidhi, there is an option. Tonsure of the head is enjoined on several occasions e. g. the Vişnupurāna provides : 274 "Tonsure should be carried out at Prayāga when on a pilgrimage, and on the death of one's father or

mother; one should not in vain (lightly ) tonsure the head'. To these occasions may be added penances. The idea seems to have been entertained that whatever sin a man commits it becomes centered in the hair, as a verse quoted by the Madanapārijata and

Pr. M. states. 275 Gaut.(277.3), Vas. 276 (24.5), Baud, Dh. S. (IL1.98-99) and others provide for the tonsure of the hair on the head and lips (except those on the eye-brows, the hair on the trunk and the top knot). Exceptions were introduced to the rule about tonsure. Daksa 277 forbade tonsure, the offering of pindas and the carrying of a corpse and all funeral rites to

Tonsure in penances

one whose father was alive and to a man whose wife was pregnant. But this prohibition did not apply to penances. The Baud. Dh. S. already referred to prohibits the tonsure of women in penances. Angiras 163, Āpastamba-smrti I. 33-34, Brhad-Yama IV.16, Vrddha-Hārita IX. 386, Parāśara IX. 54-55. Yama 54-55 provide 278 that in the case of married women whose husbands are alive and in the case of maidens all their hair should be held together and only two finger-breadths of hair should be cut off, In the case of widows and ascetics the entire head was to be shaved. It was further provided by Parāśara (IX 52-54), Sankha (q. by Par. M. II. part I, pp. 290-291) that in the case of a king or prince or a learned brāhmana tonsure of the head should not be insisted upon, but that they should have to undergo double the usual penance and the daksinā would have to be double, 279 The Mit on Yāj. III. 325 quotes a verse of Manu 280 (not found in the printed text) 'tonsure of the head is not desired in the case of learned brāhmanas and kings except in the case of those guilty of mahāpātakas, of cow-killing or of being an avakirnin'. The Mit. (on Yāj. III.264) further quotes Samvarta 281 to the effect that when the penance prescribed is only a quarter then only the hair on the body below the throat is to be shaved, when half is prescribed then in addition the hair on the lips is to be cut, when three-fourths then all the hair on the body except the knot is to be cut and in the case of the full penance all hair including the sikhā (the top-knot) also are to be cut off. The Par. M. (II part 1. p. 300) while describing cāndrāyana penance requires the cutting of the hair on all parts

of the body (including private parts), 282 The tonsure is to be performed by a barber and yet the sankalpa is 'vapanam karişye' and not 'vapanam kārayişye': From Gaut. 27,3 (vapanam vratam caret) prescribing tonsure in cāndrāyana Haradatta and others infer that vapana is unnecessary in krcchra penance.

Baths that are subsidiary to prāyascitta are performed with ashes, cow dung, clay, water, pañcagavya and water in which kusa grass has been dipped. Mantras that are to be recited at the time of bath are laid down in the Linga-purapa, the Bhavisyapurāṇa and elsewhere.

There are certain virtues to be cultivated as being common to all prāyaścittas whether secretly or openly undergone. They are called yamas and niyamas and have been set out above (p.121) from Yāj. III. 312-313. Atri (verses 48-49) sets them out somewhat differently. Manu IV, 204 (= Atri verse 47 ) refers to yamas and niyamas which Medhātithi explains as follows: viz. yamas are in the nature of prohibitions (e. g. a bıāhmana should not be killed), while niyamas consist of what is to be done (such as one should always recite the Veda, as in Manu IV. 147).

While undergoing prāyaścittas certain rules about food and other matters were to be observed. For example, Hārita 283 prescribes that the person undergoing penance should omit on all days māşa and masüra pulse, honey, taking food at the house of or belonging to others and sexual intercourse, should not speak at an improper time, should perform ācamana if he speaks with women or sūdras or those who are ucchişta. Yama ordains that one who is undergoing a penance should omit massaging the body or head with oil, the chewing of tāmbūla, applying unguents and every thing else that causes one to feel strength or sexual passion,

According to the Pr. 281 Prakāśa when undertaking a penance one should begin with the mantra 'Agne vratapate

vratam carişyāmi' (On Fire, lord of vratas! I shall perform a vrata) and when finishing a penance one should repeat the mantra 'agne vratapate vratam-acārisam tad-asakam tan-me rādhi' (01 Fira, lord of vratas; I have performed the vrata, I had the strength to do it, may it be propitious for me &c.').

Prāyascittas are of two kinds, prakāśa (undergone openly ) and rahasya (undergone secretly). A few words must be said about the latter. Gaut. ( 24.1-11), Vas. ( 25.1-3), Manu XI, 248-265, Yaj. III. 301-305, Visnu Da. S. 55 and other smrtis lay down rules about secret prāyaścittas. Where a man's 285 sin is not known to anyone except himself he may perform secret expia tion. In the case of adultery and in the case of association with one guilty of a grave sin, one may still perform a secret penance, even though the adultery is known to the adulteress and even though the man guilty of a mahāpātaka is aware of the association. Vas. 286 25.2 states the general rule that secret penances are meant for those who have consecrated the Vedic fires, who are disciplined, old or learned and that the openly undergone penances are meant for others. If such a man is himself aware of the proper penance, he should perform it with out going to an assembly (parsad ), but if he is not so aware he may consult some knowing parson privately, asking him in a general way what the penance for a particular sin may be. Vas, 25.3 provides that those who are always intent on prānāyāmas, holy texts, gifts, homas and japa are released from sin. Manu XI.226 states that those whose sins have not become public may be purified by homas and mantras. Even women and südras can perform penance in secret, since, though they cannot perform homa and repeat Vedic mantras, they can, as the Mit, on Yāj. III.300 says, perform expiation by means of gifts and prānāyāmas. Gaut. 26.2 and Manu XI. 253 prescribe that one who desires to receive a gift which he should not accept or who receives such a gift should recite in water (navel-deep according to some) the hymn of four verses beginning with 'tarat

sa mandı ' (Rg. X.58.1-4). For ons who is guilty of brāhmana murder Gaut. ( 24.6) prescribes that for the first ten days he should subsist on milk alone, on clarified butter for a further ten days, on water for another period of ten days, that he should partake of the articles specified only once in the morning, should wear wet clothes and should offer every day eight symbolic homas with clarified butter, of his hair on the body, nails, skin, flesh, blood, muscles, bones and marrow with the words 'I offer in the mouth of Death' added at the end. 287 Yāj. IIL 301 prescribes that the murderer of a brāhmana should fast for ten days, should recite the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg. X 190 ) while submerged in water, donate a cow yielding milk, while Vispu prescribes that he should bathe for a month in a flowing stream or river, should perform every day 16 prāṇāyāmas, should eat only once a day sacrificial food and may then become purified. Vişnu provides that the drinker of surā becomes pure by observing the vrata ( as stated ) for brāhmana murder and reciting Aghamarşaņa; while the thief of brāhmana's gold becomes pure by fasting for three days and reciting the sacred Gāyatri ten thousand times and one guilty of incest by the repeated recital of the hymn beginning with 'sahasrasirşā' (Rg. X. 90).

The sages observed that some of the penances mentioned in old smrtis were terrible and involved loss of life. Therefore, gradually more humane and easier penances came to be prescribed. For example, Harita 288 states "brāhmaṇas who have studied dharmaśāstra should prescribe a penance appro priate to the age, the time and the strength of the brāhmaṇa (sinner), the penance being such that he may not lose his life and yet may be purified; one should not prescribe an observance that will cause great distress ( to the sinner). Angiras also says that the parşad should indicate the penance resolved upon by all the members which would not cause loss of life. Sankha

declares : 289 a brāhmana should never practise the performance of a penance in a forest full of thieves, ferocious beasts, elephants and other animals through fear of injury to life. The body that is the all in all (i. e. the only source ) of (the obsery ance of) dharma must be protected with efforts; just as water oozes down from the mountain, so dharma springs from the body'.

to OFTE As times changed easier substitutes (called pratyāmnāyas) were found and prescribed. The word pratyāmnāya was used in this sense in the Ap. Sr. S. V. 20.18 (yadyanādhyo-gnin adadhita kāmam-evaikām gām dadyāt sā gavām pratyāmnāyo bhavatiti vijñāyate), 6. 30.9 and Sān. Sr. S. 14.51.6 and other sūtras. Saṁvarta 290 states that if a sinner is unable to undergo the Prājāpatya penance, he may donate instead a cow yielding milk and if he cannot donate such a cow he may donate the full price of such a cow. Parāśara 291 (XII. 63-64) provides four substitutes for a Prājāpatya penance viz. the recital of the famous Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III, 62.10) ten thousand times or 200 prāņāyāmas, or bathing twelve times in a sacred watery place after drying the head on each bath, or taking to a journey of two yojanas towards a holy place. From the words of Gaut. 19.16 and 18 (quoted above in note 120) it follows that gold is a substitute for a cow by way of penance. The Brahmapurāņa 292 provides that in the absence of a cow a niska or half niska

or a quarter niska may be given. The Caturviinsatimata 293 provides several pratyāmnāyas for Prājāpatya viz. recital of Gayatri ten thousand times, standing in water, gift of a cow to a brāhmaṇa-these four (including Prājāpatya) are equal, as also a thousand homas with sesame, recitation of the whole samhita of the veda, feeding twelve brahmanas, Pavakesti are equal. The Caturvimśatimata 294 stated that one should substitute the gift of one cow for Prājāpatya penance, of two cows for Sānta pana, of three cows for Parāka, Tapta-krcchra and Ati krcchra and eight for Cāndrāyana. The result was that from medieval times at least even in the case of mahāpātakas there was a sliding scale of penances ultimately ending in feeding brāhmaṇas or making monetary or other presents to them. For example, the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 326) says that in the case 295 of the twelve years' penance, optionally 360 prājā patyas could be performed, each prājāpatya extending over twelve days, that if a man was unable to undergo this he should donate as many (i.e. 360) milch cows, if that was impossible he may donate their price or 360 niskas or even half or quarter thereof &c. Yaj. III.309 provides (a lakh of) homas with sesame to the accompaniment of the Gayatri or making brahmanas recite the Veda by the gift of sesame. Vas.28.18-19 (=Atri VI. 7-8) and Visnu Dh. S.90.10 state that by feeding seven or five brāhmaṇas on the Full moon of Vaišākha with sesame and honey a man becomes free of all sins. These provi

Method of pratyāmnāya

129

sions are maintained in almost all medieval works such as the Smrtyarthasāra pp. 149, 155, Prayascittasāra p. 203, Pr. T. pp. 517, 541, Pr. Mayükha p. 18 &c. The same method is followed in penances for lesser periods. It is due to this provi sion in the smrtis that in modern times men, when on death-bed, perform prāyaścittas for all their sins by donating a cow or more or by monetary presents to priests.295a 

Some interesting sidelights are thrown on the prices of milch cows, cows and bulls by the medieval writers. The Pr. V. (p. 199 ) states that the price of a milch cow (payasvini) was 3 purānas, that of an ordinary cow (go) one purāna and that of a bull was five purāṇas. The Pr, T. (pp. 517-18 ) quotes Kātyāyana to the effect that the price of a cow (go) is 32 paņas and that of a male calf one purāņa, that a paņa is copper weighing 80 raktikās or equal to 80 varātakas ( cowries ), that 16 paņas were equal to one purāna (following Bhavisya and Matsya purānas), that by nişka is not meant the one indicated by Manu (VIII, 137) but a dināraniska i. e. gold weighing 32 raktikās. The Prāyascittendusekhara p. 7 follows Yāj. 1.365 and holds that niska is silver equal (in weight) to four surarnas or a pala. A raktikā weighs on an average 1.8 grains; so a copper pana of 80 raktikās would weigh about 144 grains. Therefore a dhenu was equal to 32 panas (or two purānas) i. e. about 26 tolas of copper (one tola being taken as equal to 180 grains). Vide H. of Dh. vol. III pp.120-121 notes 161 and 162 for information about ancient coins and their weights. There appears to be owing to lapse of centuries some difference in the views of several writers. According to Vijñāneśvara four suvarnas are equal to a silver niska. According to the Lilāvati 20 varātakas are equal to a kākini, 4 kākinis are equal to a pana and a niska is equal to 256 panas.

295a. There was a parallel to this method of pratyāmnāya in Europe as remarked by Gibbon A year of penance was appreciated at 26 solid of silver, about four pounds sterling, for the rich, at 3 solidi or nine shitki nga PD for the indigent; and these alms were soon appropriated to the Churer which derived from the redemption of sins an inexhaustible source o nome opulence and dominion' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. pertrah Institute p. 187 (Smith's ed, of 1862).
