CHAPTER III PRAYAŚCITTA; ITS ORIGIN, DERITATION 

AND JEANING 

It is not necessary to turn to prayascittas as removers of sin, A mumber of subjects will fall to be trusted here. 

First, an attempt inust be made to understand tlic etsnuo logy and meaning of the word 'prayascitta' in ancient times There are two forms of the word, prāyascitti and prayascitta, which occur in Vedic works without distinction of meaning and both forms are sauly old, though payascitti appears to be the older of the two The form prāyascitti frequently occuis in the Tai, s (as in II. 1.2,4, II. 1 4.1, III, 1,323, V 1.9.3, V. $12.1)1361, In some of these passages no question of sin arises. The void means 'doing some thing which would get rid of some accidental happening or mishap such as the breaking of an ukhā (a pot oi saucepan for bojling or cooking) or the sun's losing its brilliance,' In Tai S. V, 3.12.1 the word is used in the sense of an expiation for a sin. So even in very old books the word had two shades of meaning. The Kausitaki137 Br. (vi, 12) states : "they say 'whatever mistake or excess occurs in the sacrifice that affects the priest Iralımā, that he treats with the three fold learning (i, e, the three Vedas)". The word also occurs in the Atharraveda XIV. 1 30, Vāj. S. 39,12 (in close proximity to niskrti), in the Ait. Br. V 27, in the Sat. Br. IV.5,7,1, VII. 1,4 9, XI, 5.38, XIL 4.16 and in other works also The form prāyaścitta occurs in Kausītaki Br. V. 9, VI 12 and elsewhere, The Aśv. Śr. III 10.38 and Sāṅkbayana Śr. II 19.1 respectively employ the words prāyaścitti and prāyascitta13s In Pār gr I.

TIistory of Dharmasūslia 

(Vol. 10 the form 'prayascitti' is employed. Jai, in several places epiploys the word prāyaścitta (as in VI 37, VI 4.10, VI 5.45 and 49, XII 316). Sabara139 on the last sūtra (XIL 3.16) ex plains that the prāyaścittas (in the Sruti texts) are of two kinds, viz some are meant to make good the defect in the procedure and materials of sacrifice which arises or befalls through some neglect or heedlessness, while others are subsidiary parts of a rito when an occasion arises i e they are undertaken to atone for not doing what is ordained or doing something which is forbidden (e g non-performance of daily Agnihotra oven though the sun rises) The Sat. Br 140 XIT 4 and Ait Br. 322-11 pro vide some interesting and amusing examples of the mishaps for which prāyaścittas are provided e. g when a vicious boar, ram or dog runs between the sacrifical fires, or if Agnihotra milk gets spilled while the cow is being milked or if the milk pot is turned upside down or if it were to break or if the cow were to lie down while being inilked, or if the fire were to go out after the first libation is offered etc Vide also Mānaya-grhya I 3, Hir. gr I 51-16, Bhāradyāja gr IL 32, Kausika-sutra 46. 14-55, ĀŚY II 10 and Asy gr.

VL 1.157 explains'41 both prāyaścitti and prāyaścitta on the analogy of the word Pāraskara Prāgaścıttas may be said to be, in the language of the Mimāmsā, either ki atvartha or purusāi tha The former are prescribed in the Srautasūtras.

Derivation of Prayascitta 

works are passed over, as they have either been mentioned in vol. I. or were of rare occurrence even in olden days. 

Most digests and commentaries derive the word prāyaścitta relying on a verse (attributed to Angiras142 by some) from prāya (meaning "tapas') and citta (meaning resolve or firm belief), the idea being that prāyaścittas are so called because of their association with or emergence from a resolve to under go tapas or because of the firm belief that it will be a means of the removal of sin, Various other derivations are suggested by some writers. The Balambhatti143 on Yaj. TIL 206 quotes a half verse to the effect that 'prāya' means 'sin' and 'citta' means 'purification', which had been quoted by Paksadharamisra144, Bhaktūpādhyāya and the Todarānanda, but the Pr. M. (p. 2) says that the source or authenticity of that verse is doubtful. Hemādri refers to an unnamed bhāsyakāra's explanation viz. 'prāya' means 'destruction' and 'citta' means 'joining together' and prāyaścitta means the making good what is lost and that the word denotes & nainıttıka action on sin. 

The Par. M. quotes a smrti text145 and says that that is prāyaścitta whereby the 'citta' (the mind) of a repentant sinner is made generally (prayasah) free (from emotion i.e brought to a normal state) by the parsad (assembly of learned brahmanas). 

Here 'prayah' seems to be taken as equal to 'prayasah' and 'citta' has its usual sense, In Sāyana's 146 comment on the

The Pr Vi p 3 and Pr, Tattya p 467 quote Hārīta and give147 yet another derivation (from 'prayata' pure and 'cita' collected), in accordance with which 'prāyascitta' means such actions as tapas, gists and sacrifices whereby a man becomes purified (prayata) and destroys his accumulated sins (*cita' being equal to 'upacita'), just as clothes are made clean by the employ ment of salts, moist heat, putting in boiling water on a fire, and washing in water Hence, as the Mit says, the word prāya scitta conventionally148 denotes a cortain act or rite of the naimatika type (since it takes place only when an occasion arises) intended for the destruction of sin (and therefore being desired for removal of sin it may also be called kāmya) The Par.

150 Actions are divided into three kinds, nitya, naimittika and kāmya. Nitya acts are those lhe sandhya-vandana (which are obligatory and performed daily as a duts aaci which if not performed lead to sinfulness), naimittika are those acts which have to be done only on some occasion (as a bath on an eclipse) and kāmya rites are those which are performed out of a desire to secure some object (as the sacrifice called putreṣṭi for a son ), Manu in XI 53 871 "thereforc (because of the remnants of tbe guilt of

Meaning and nature of prayaścitta

of occasion arises), Jābāla q in the Pr. Prakāśa holds that priyascitta partakes of the nature of both naimittika and kāmya actions. The Pr. Prakāśa finds fault with the definitions of prāyascitta proposed by the Kalpataru, Sulapāni and others and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that those alone are prayascittas which are so spoken of by the learned, just as on Jaimini II.1.32 (tac-codakesu mantrākhyā) Bhattācārya explains that mantras are those which the respectable rājsīrhas and those who studied the Vedas so designate150.7 

Sins as stated by Brhaspatiisi and others are of two kinds, viz, intentionally committed and unintentionally committed. 

Great divergence of views has prevailed from very ancient times as to whether prāyaścittas can destroy sins intentionally committed Manu XI. 45 and Yāj. III. 226 are positive that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by prāyaścittas or by the study of the Veda The difficulty arises about sins coni mitted intentionally or with full knowledge, Gaut. (19, 3-6 

= Vas, 22. 2-5) states two views, 151a one holding that prāya Ścitta should not be performed since deeds (here sinful deeds) are not destroyed (except by experiencing the consequences thereof), the other view holding that prāyaścitta should be per 

(Continued froin the last page ) crimes in former lives men are boro blind or idiots &c.) penances must always be performed for the sale of purification, because those whose sins have not been expiated are born with disgraceful marks,' Though Manu employs the word 'dityam' here, what is meant is that wlien a sin is com mitted, a prāyaścıtta must necessarily be performed and it is poi lelt to the volution of the sinner whether to perform it or not Vide Mit on Yāj III. 220 But it does not follow from this that if prayascitta for removing a sin 19 not performed, another sir is thereby committed, for ia that case there would be anavastha (regressus ad infinitum)

formed (for the removal of the effects of sin). The latter relies upon certain indications in Vedic passages. Gaut, relies upon four such passages. The first says "152 "after performing the punahsioma 153 one can come back to (become fit for) soma sacri. fice (i, e, for Vedic rites in general). Another indication is · 'after performing Vratyastoma (one becomes fit for Vedic facri fices). A third is: 'He, who offers the Asvamedha sacrifice, crosses beyond all sin, beyond brahmana ipurder'. The fourth is. one should make a person charged with grave sins per form the Agnistut Vasistlia also (20 1-2) gives expression to the two views about the efficacy of penances, 154 Manu XI. 45 (latter half) states, that according to some, prāyaścittas may be prescribed for the removal of intentionally committed sins from indications contained in the Vedas. It cannot be said that these Sruti passages are mere ar thavūdas (i. e laudatory texts). They must really be taken, though expressed in the form of ordinary arthavādas, as laying down (a vdh) that one desirous of destroying his sins should perform Aśvamedha and the other sacrifices mentioned in this case the maxim of rātrisattra 155 applies (vide Jai. IV. 3. 17-19). There are certain satıras (sacrifices extending over more than twelve days) called Trayo

dasarātra, Caturdasarātra and so on. All these are called rātri Battras. With reference to these a Vedic passage says 'those who approach (i. e. perform) thesa rātrisattras attain stability (long life or super-eminence)'. In the text prescribing the Tātri gattras there is no mention of any special reward for perfor mance. Therefore 'stability' (pratastītā) contained in the passage must be held to be the reward of the performance of rātrisattras and not mere heaven (which is the reward of all sacrifices for which no special reward is mentioned, according to Jai. IV. 3. 15-16). The same maxim applies to passages like Yāj III. 226 which say that sin is removed by penances 156. Medhātithi draws attention to the story in the Tai.S. VI. 2.75, Kathaka S. VII, 5, Ait Br 35.2 that Indra consigned yutis to sulāurkas (dogs or wolves) and had to perforin the rites called Upahavya to get rid of the sin. Manu states his own opinion in the next verse (XI. 46) that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by the recitation of Vedic texts and sins conimitted intentionally through folly are destroyed by various prāyaścittas. Yāj. I. 226 (latter half) appears to hold that prāyaścittas do not destroy sins intentionally committed, but the sinner undergoing the prescribed penance becomes fit to be associated with other people on account of the texts (laying down the prāyagcittas); but Yāj, implies, it seems, that the results of sin intentionally committed (such as Hell and the like) are not got rid of. Manu XI. 189 prohibiting social in tercourse with singers who have not performed penance practi cally conveys the same idea as that of Yāy in III, 226 (latter half). Yā), III, 220 observes that a man guilty of patalas should perform prāyasoitta for his own purification (bero and in the next world); in this way (i, e if he performs penance) his inner soul recovers its composure and the people also become satisfied, This verse puts in a nutshell the purposes of prāyaścittas as conceived by the smrtis, viz. purging of sin (or purification), the satisfaction of the sinner's mind, admission to intercourse with

The Par. M. (11.1 pp 200-201) cites a Terza of Jābali and verses of Davala setting forth the two Tiers about the eficacs of prāyaścittas, while it also cites the view of Baudhayana-smti that there is no prāyaścitta for sins committed knoringly and the Tier of Angiras that the penance is doable in the latter case's Aagiras further says that prāgascitsas do destroy the sin arising from committing acts that are forbidden and the like, just as the rising sun removes dark ness Mapu II, 47 provides itssica-born man having become liable to perform a penance (for a sin), Thether he committed it through fate or by some act committed in a former existence, must not have intercourse with virtuous men until he performs The proper penance.'

IV) 

Twofold Consegnences of sin 

65 

Iu this conflict among the authors of smrtis the solution proposed by the Mit. on Yaj TII. 226 has been accepted by most medieval writers and is as follows160. The potentialities and consequences of sins are twofold, viz those leading to Hell and the others preventing intercourse with members of the society to which the sioner belongs Therefore, even though a prāya scitta may not be efficacious to prevent the first mentioned consequence (viz fall into Hell), there is nothing improper in prāgascitta being effective in removing the obstacle to associa tion with other people. As to sinful acts that are not pataniya (do not cause loss of caste) prāyaścitta does destroy such sin fulness as expressly stated by Manu, XI. 46. Even as to sins that are palaniya and are committed intentionally, if a penance ending in death is undergone as laid down by Manu XI. 73, Yaj III 247-248 and Gaut 22.2-3 for brahmana murder; Manu XI 90-91, Yāj IL 253, Gaut 23 1 for drinking surā; Gaut 23 8 11, Manu XI 103-104 and Yay. II. 259 for sexual intercourse with the guru's wife; Manu XI, 99-100 and Yāj. III. 257 for theft of brahmana's gold; them the sin is destroyed as stated by Ap. Dh S I924 25 and I 10.28.18 quotted above When Manu says (in XI. 89 latter half) that there is no penance for the sin of slaying a brāhmana intentionally, the proper interpretation of this read along with Manu XI 46 quoted above is not that there is total absence of prayaścitta in such a case, but that ordinary prāya 'scittas (such as those in Manu XI. 72) would not do in such a case, but only very heavy ones that would end in death.

The Par M. (TL part 1 pp 201–203) sets out this view of the Mit and appears to hold it itself. It sets out another view also. Those who hold this latter view read Yaj. II. 226 ag 'kāmatosvyavabāryastu' with an avagraha. The meaning then is that one who has performed the penance prescribed for a sin does not fall into Hell, but he cannot be allowed to associate with good men ( śistas ) if he is guilty of a wilful sia, There is a verse of Manu (XI 190 = Visou Dh, s. 54,32 ) that one should not associate with those who slay children, who return evi) for the good done to them, who slay those that come for protection and who kill women, even though they might have become purified by undergoing the appropriate penance, There is a similar verse of Yāj III 298 on which the comment of Vijñāneśvara is most interesting as indicative of the spirit of our medieval writers who were always oppressed by the might of words (Vedic or smurti) deemed as authoritative. The Mit remarks 161 'the prohibition (contained in Yā). II, 298) is based on the text alone (and not on logic or reasoning). What cannot a text do? There is nothing too heavy for a text, Therefore, even though a light pedance is prescribed for slaying an adulterous woman, still there is a prohibition against associating with such slayers based on the words of the text',

The Power of Authoritative Texts 

This maxim is taken from the bhāsya of Sabara and is a favourite device with all Dharmaśāstra writers from Viśvarūpa downwards to justify any statement of the smrtis however illogical or exaggerated it might appear to be. The Pr. T. (pp. 544-545) quotes 162 the Mit, about the two Śaktis of sin and its remarks on Yāj III, 298 and does not approve of them, relying on the words of Brhaspati that no decision should be arrived at on the bare words of the śāstra, but it should also be supported by reasoning and that the words 'slayers of women' do not refer to adulterous women but to innocent women (such as the wives of one's enemies), Narada. (sahasa, Verse 11) holds that those who are punished by the king with a five of the first or second (madhyama) kind can be allowed to associate with other members of society but those who are awarded the highest fine should not be spoken to by others 1624, Those who take the view of the sinner's inability to associate with other men even after undergoing penance rely also upon Vedānta-sūtra II, 4. 43 (bahis-tūbhayathāpi smrterācārācca). The Par, M, very rightly points 163 out that the sūtra refers to those who after going in for life-long celibacy abandon the duties of that stage of life (āśrama) and that it does not refer to householders and quotes a yerse of Kausika in support, The Smrti-muktaphala (Pr,, pp. 867-868) refers to this discussion contained in the Par. M. The Pr. M. (p. 7) appears 104 to hold that the great Saṅkarācārya explained

Vedāntasūtra II 4, 43 after reading Yāj III 226 ag 'kamatos .yyayahāryastu' and that those who fell from the vow of life-long 

celibacy (either as naisthika brabmacārins or as sannyāsına ) , were to be excommunicated (and not to be associated with) The printed editions of the bhāsya contain no express quotation of Yajnavalkya's verse, but from the fact of his quoting Atri's Verse it is possible to hold that Saṅkarācārya understood Yajñavalkya as the Pr, M. says he did. 

A question may naturally be asked: why should it be accepted that penances destroy sin (as stated in Ya) I 226). The answer is: what 165 actions are grave sins or minor sins or not sins at all is laid down by the śāstra (śruti and smrtis) For example, it is not clear to ordinary people why being an officer over mines or making friends of low people or being a servant of a śūdra should be a sin at all But the smrtis say so. If the smrtis are to be relied upon for determining what acts are sinful, then it follows as a matter of course that the same smrtis which speak of penances as removers of sins must also be accepted and that no other means for determining the efficacy of penances can be appealed to So also the Bhagavad gitā (IV 37) states that the fire of spiritual knowledge consumes all (accumulated, saficta) actions (and their consequences). 

Many of the sins (though not all) for which penances are provided in the smrtis are also offences punishable by the king or State For example, murder, theft, incest, perjury are acts punishable by the State in almost all countries even now and were so in ancient and medieval India Persons guilty of these were also liable to undergo prāyaścittas. It is probably due to this double liability that punishments for crimes in ancient and medieval India were light as compared with the heavy punish ments for even trifling crimes inflicted in western countries only a century or two ago But there are other acts which are not punishable by the State now and were not probably punished even in ancient or medieval India by the king. For example, forgetting Veda studied by a person, not tonding Vedic fires consecrated by a person himself, sleeping till after sun-1188 and sleeping at sunset are palakas, aco to Vas I 19 and some of those are upapātakas acc to Yā, II239. It does not seem

IV) Prayascittas and Secular Punishments likely that an Indian king ever panished any parson for these. On the other hand, obstructing the road, prying when the king is taking his meals, sitting before the king on one's haunches, speaking loudly before the king are among the fifty chalas of which the king could take cognisance suo motus and award suitable punishment (vide H, of Dh vol III p. 266). But there is nothing to show that such actions ever fell within the purview of the rules about prāyascittas, The important questions are: What was the relation of the rules about prāyascittas which were to be prescribed by a parisad (a meeting of learned brāhmadas) to punishments by the king as regards actions which were both patakas inviting penances and crimes entailing punishments by the King? Which of these two sets of rules was earlier? Were penance and punishment cumulative or alternative? It is difficult to give definite opinions on these questions. We know that prāgaścittas like Aśvamedha are spoken of even in the Tai S. We also know that the prasnavivāla (which is quite close to prādyivaka in derivation and meaning) occurs in the Vaj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai Br. II. 5. 6. Therefore it follows that judicial functions were very early separated from the executive functions of the king. The reference to the ordeal of fire in the Tandya Br 14. 6. 6 (vide H, of Dh, vol. II p. 361) and the grasping of a red-hot hatchet in the hand by a person accused of theft and his being killed show that ordeals were administered and the punishment for theft was death. Bphaspati, quoted in the Vivādaratnakara, says 'When a man of good character and a diligent reader of the Veda has com mitted theft he shall ba kept in prison for a long time and shall be caused to perform penance after having been compelled to restore the goods' (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 362 166). 

' The pariṣad made its own rules about prāyağcittas and the king awarded punishments. Which set of rules was earlier it is difficult to say. The king did not very probably interfere with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the parisad and the brāhmanas helped the king in the administration of justice by being judges and by advising him as to the punishments to be imposed (vide 

166. Frequart en una sua part I HA E ETC: पायश्चित्तं तु कारयेत् ।। बृहस्पति g by विवादरत्नाकर p 331. It is possible that this 1 erse means that a learned brābmana who has been well conducted but fell A victim to the temptation of theft should not be jailed for a long time because jaut life torments bis mind and therefore he should be made to restore stolen property and given pedaace,

History of Dhiar masastra 

(Vol. Vigou Dh, S. V. 194). Gautama VII1, echoing the words of the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4 5, observes: 167 'the king and the brāhmada with profound learning uphold the moral order in the world (or are upholders of the sacred law). The Āp. Dh, S. (I 5.10, 12-16) contains very important inforniation: 'The ācārya shall order those who, while participating according to the śāstras (in the privileges and responsibilities of their castes), have gone astray through the weakness of their senses to perform penances accord ing to tlie dictates (of the smrtis) commensurate with their (sinful) acts. If they transgress their ācārya's order he shall take them to the king. The king shall send them to his purohita proficient in dharmaśāstra and the science of government. He (purohita) shall order them to porform (proper penances) if they are brābmapas. He shall reduce them by forcible means except corporal punishment and slavery.' So this passage shows that the king helped in carrying out prāyas cittas. Narada includes 'neglect of penancas' anong matters solely dependent on the king (prakirpaka, verse 3) and not on complaints by private individuals. Davala 168 probably conveys the real position when he says: "The king is the giver of krochras (i. o his consent is required for actually undergoing the prescribed penances), the learned man who has studied Dharmaśāstras prescribes the prāyaścitta, the sinner carries out the penance and the king's officer sees to the safe performance of the prescribed penance' Parāśara VII, 28 says 'an assembly should point out the proper penance after getting the permission of the king, it should not be done without reference to him, but slight penance may be done with out informing him', The Par, M. I. part 1. p. 232 explains that this applies to prayascittas for sins like govadha or those that are greater than it. Devala 169 also has similar verses.

Relation of the Parisad and the King 

Parāśara VIL, 29 states that the king also should not ignore the parisad and should not by himself prescribo penance. Paithinasi quoted by the Dandaviveka (p. 76) provides 170 for both prāyağcitta and punishment and from the tenor of the verse 

it appears that both were to be enforced by the king. The posi - tion is tolerably clear as to medievel times One feels great hesitation in stating definitely the relation of punishment to penances and the king's position as to both in ancient times. Ap. Dh, S. 1. 9. 24. 1-4 provide 172 that one who kills a ksatriya or a vaisya or a śūdra shall respectively give one thousand COWS, a hundred cows and ten cows for the purpose of removing the enmity and that in each of these cases one bull was to be given in addition for the purpose of expiation. Āpastamba does not expressly state to whom the cows were to be given, The commentator Haradatta explains that they were to be given to brāhmadas. Manu XI. 127, 129, 130, and Yāj II. 266-267 have similar provisions but in the chapter on penances. On the other hand, Baud, Dh, S.I. 10 23, expressly states that the COws are to be given to the king. As both the words 'vaira niryātanartham' and 'prāyaścittarthaḥ are employed by Ap. it may be said that the cows were to be made over to the king even according to Āpastamba. The cows were to be made over to the king for bestowa) on the family of the murdered person to mollify them and if they refused to receive them the king was 

of to retain them for himself but was to distribute them among brāhmanas. We know that Manu (IX. 243–245) provides that the fine recovered from a man guilty of mortal sins vas not to be taken for himself by the king but was to be offered to Varuna and thrown into water or was to be distributed among learned brāhmapas. Manu IX, 236 provides that for those who were guilty of the four grave sins (brāhmada murder &c.) and did not undergo penanca for the same the king should ipflict corporal punishment (branding on the forehead) toget her with fine in accordance with the śāstra, Manu IX. 237

(= Matsya 227 164) and Visnu V, 4 say that on the forehead a mark of female private parts with red-hot iron should be branded in the case of incest, the mark of a tavern flag in the case of drinking surā, the mark of dog's foot in the case of theft (of brāhmana's gold) and the mark of a beadless trunk in the case of a beabmapa-murder. Manu IX. 240 further prescri bes that men of all castes guilty of the four mahāpātakas com mitted unintentionally that perform the proper penance should not be branded on the forehead by the king but shonld ba awarded the highest fine Manu IX, 241 and 24% provide that a brāhmang guilty of these grave sins unintentionally may be punished with the middle amercement (if he himself be possessed of good qualities) but if he was guilty of the grave sins committed intentionally he should be banished from the kingdom being allowed to take with him his wealth and paraphernalia; while persons other than brāhmapas when guilty of grape sins unintentionally com nitted were to be deprived of all their wealth and if guilty intentionally they were to be sentenced to death. These verses show that though prāyascitta be per formed persons guilty of grave sins were liable to undergo punishment and if no penance was performed then they were liable to branding and also fines etc Manu XI. 56 provides that bearing false witness is similar to the drinking of sund and Manu XI, 57 and Yaj. II. 230 hold that misappropria tion of a deposit is like the theft of gold Vispu Dh. S (V 169 ) provides that the mugappropriator of a deposit was to be wade to return the deposit or its price with interest and was to be punished like a thief by the king and V 179 that a false witness had all his property confiscated. Theso instances establish that both fines by the king (i, e lāja-danda ) and penances prescribed by the assembly of learned men (i. parisaddanda or daiva danda) had to be undergone by those guilty of some grave sins that were also looked upon as crimes In some cases the penance and the punishment were the same for example, Gaut 23 10-11, Vas. 20. 13, Manu XI 104, Yaj. III 259 and several other smrtikāras prescribe for incest the penance of the excision of the testicles and penis and proceeding toward the south or south-west till the body falls Nārada as quoted above proscribes for incest the punishment (danda) of the excision of the testicles The Mit. on Yaz. m. 233 quotes Nārada and remarks that the punishment of excision and death prescribed by Yāj III, 233 applies only to non-brābmapas and that in such cases the punishment of death itself is theIV) 

Prayasrutia and punishment by kung 

prāgaścitta There were works like the Madanapārijāta272 (p. 827) and the Mitaksarā that held that the prohibition against corporal harm to brāhmanas (Manu VIII. 380) applies only to matters other than prāyaścittas and that since the Mapusorti itself (XI. 100) states that a brābmana guilty of theft of brāhmana's gold may go to the king with an iron club and have his head smashed by the king, the death of a brāhmana as a penance for theft by being struck with a club presented by himself was not Tuled out. In some cases punishment by the king was deemed to have purged a man of sin and so penance seems to have been thought necessary, as Manu VII, 318 (=Vas 19.45 ) says 'men that commit sins and are punished by the king become purified and reach heaven like good men who perform meritorious deeds.' The Mit on Yā). I, 259 explains that this holds good only where the punishment is death, as in the case of incest noted above. Āp. Dh. S. II. 10 27. 15-16 provide 173 that & parson guilty of slaying a man, of theft and of forcible seizure of land was to be deprived of his wealth by the king and was to be sentenced to death and that if the offender was a brahmana he was to have a piece of cloth tied over his eyes for the whole of his life (i. e, he was not to be sentenced to death). It appears that in very ancient times as provided by Āp. Dh, S, I 9.25,4 the thief approached the king 174 with a club (of iron or khadira wood) on his shoulder and announced his guilt, when the king struck him with the club; on his being killed he became free from guilt. This was a panance as well as a legal punishment. Manu has a similar rule in his chapter on punishments (VIII, 314-316) providing that the thief should carry a weapon (called musala) ora Club of khadira wood or a double-edged saklı or an iron staff and that if the king strikes him once with the club and he is killed

History of Dhar maśāstia 

I Vol or if he is not killed but is allowed to go half dead and lives, the thief is froed from the guilt. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 257 quotes a prose passage from Saṅkba and a verse from Samvarta (12%) to the same effect Manu in the chapter on ponances (XI. 100-101 = Agnipurāda 169. 20-21) provides the game procedure for theft 89 a pedance. Vas 20. 41, Yay. II. 259, Viggu 52, 1-% and Parāsara XII, 69-70 provide a somewhat similar pedance for the thief of brahmana's gold. Vasistha introduces an important change viz, that the king hands over to the thief & weapon made of udumbara wood (or probably of copper) with which the thief is to kill himself. It appears that gradually the king gave up this unpleasant method of award ing punishmont porsonally Nārada 175 (parisista, verses 46-47) provides that after the thief comes running to the king and announces his guilt, the king was to touch him (with the olub, as a symbolic gesture) and then let him off aud the thief ba came froed from sin by his confession of guilt. It has to be remembered, howover, that the thief had to restore, even when he underwent penanco, stolen property, as stated by Manu VIII, 40, Yāj. I 36 and 270, Brhaspati and by digasts 176 like the Pr. Prakarang If it were impossible to make the thief restore the stolen property the king had to make it good from his orn treasury 377 (Gaut X. 47, Sāntiparya 75, 10, Kautilya II. 16) or he had to make his officers 1:8 entrusted with the duty of preventing thefts pay the price of the stolen property (Ap Dk. S. II. 10. 26. 8). Vide for further details H, of DI YOL III. pp. 166-168. It appears that the actual carrying out of the sentence of death was later on assigned to Candalas as stated by Manu X, 56 and Viṣnu Dh, S. 16. 11 (vadhya-ghātitvam cāndalānām).

Circumstances to be considered Another point to be noted is that as regards the awarding of punishments and prescribing of penances, the matters to be considered trere the same viz. whether the lapse was inten tional 179 (kāmataḥ) or unintentional (akāmatah) or whether it was the first offence or whether it was repeated and what the circumstances as to the time, the place, the caste, the age, the capacity, learning, wealth were. Compare Kautilya IV. 10, Gaut.XII. 48, Manu VII. 16 and VIII. 126, Yaj I 368, Visnu v. 194, Vas. 19.9 about punishments with Baud.188 Dh. S. I. 1.16, Yāj. III. 293 (= Atri verse 248 and Agnipurāna 173, 6), Angiras 143,Viśvamitra, Vrddha-Haritalx.297, and Vyāghra as regards penances It is on account of this close connection between punishments and penances that the Prāyaścittatattva, after quoting Derala to the effect that if a man makes no move for taking prayascitta for one year, he has to undergo double penance thereafter and to pay a double fine to the king, re marks that the maxim is that prāyasoittas are to be moulded on the lines of punishments1ss. The Pr. M. (pp. 124-125) quotes Kāsyapa who provides a penance for one that causes mischief to a well, public park, bridge, rampart wall or a temple or idol, then quotes Vispu V. 169 which prescribes the highest fine for a breaker of idols, Mantu IX 285 which provides a fine of 500

Tast Literature on prājaścittas 

The literature on prāyaścittas is vast in extent, since in ancient times they loomed very large in the popular mind. Out of tho 28 chapters of the Gautamadharma-sūtra, ten (i. e, more than one-third of the whole) are devoted to pavancesOut of the 30 chapters of the printed Vasistha-dharmasūtra, prāyaścittas cover pine (20-28) Manu devotes versos 44 to 265 (in all 222) of chapter eleven to penances and the Yājñavalkyasmrti con taining 1009 versos deals with prāyaścittas in 122 verses (II. 205-327). Several printed smrtis such as those of Angiras (168 verses), Atri (chapters 1-8), Davala ( 90 verses), Brhad-Yama (182 verses), Sātātapasmrti (in 274 verses) from the Ānandāśrama collection of smrtis aloue deal only with prāya scittas. Many other smortis and several purānas, such as the Agni (chap 168-174), Garuda 5%, Kūrma (Uttarardha 30-34), Varāla 131-136, Brabmānda (Upasamhārapādachap. 9), Visoudbarm ottara (II 73, II 234-237) contain hundreds of verses ou prāyaścittas. Besides commentaries like the Mitaksarā, Aparārka, Par, M. and others and digests like Madanapārijāta (pp. 691-994), there are special digests dealing with prāyaścittas alone such as Hemādri on Prāyaścitta (which is of doubtful authenticity), the Prāyaścittaprakarana of Bhavadeva, Prāya. scittaviveka, Prāgascittatattva, Spirtimuktāphala (prayascitta section), Prāgascittasāra (part of Nrsimbaprasāda), Prāya scittamayūkba, Prāgascittaprakāśa (ms. in the Anūp Sapskrit library, Bikaner, No. 2610), Prāgascittendusekbara of Nāgojibhatta, which have been utilised in this work. The niost elaborate treatment is found in Prayascittaviveka, Par. M. I parts 1 and 2, and Prayascittaprakāśa, 

The commentators discuss the question about the persons who have adhikara (capacity) for having penances prescribed for them Since Manu XI, 44 (prāyascittiyate narah) and Yāj II. 219 (parah patanam-rcchati) both employ the word 'man' without 184 any qualification, the commentators and digests say that penances are meant for men of all vardas, for all persons born of unions in the reverse order (pratilomajas) and for even cāndalas. Yāj. III, 262 states that a śūdra sinner

(Vol. though he has no adhikāra (for recitation of Vedic mantras and homa), yet becomes purified by undergoing the observances (except japa and homa) for the periods prescribed. Angiras 185 provides that penance may be administered to a gūdra devoid of japa and hioma. Even as to japa and homa there were works like the Madanapārijāta p. 749 and Vy. M (p. 112) that relying on a verse of Parāśara VI, 63-64 held that a homa could be performed for women and sūdras in the ordinary fire through & brāhmang186, The Pr, V, relies on Manu X. 62 and a prose passage of Devala for the proposition that even Candālas have to perform penances, if they act contrary to the rules and pro hibitions laid down for them Since the non-performance of what is prescribed and doing what is forbidden lead to sin, the person guilty of these or the person who has a desire to destroy his sins is a person entitled to perform prāyaścitta, as also one who repents of his guilt. 

Before going into the subject of the several prāyaścittas prescribed for each grave or minor sin, some questions of a general character have to be disposed of. 

Some smrtis like Brhad-yama II. 1-% and Saṅkha state that a boy over five years of age and less than eleven years old, if guilty of some pātakas such as drinking surā, has not to undergo penance personally, but his brother, father or other

Prayascuttes and children relative or friend has to undergo it for him and that if a child is less than five then whatever act it may do it is not deemed a crime, nor is it a sin and it is not liable to any legal penalty nor to any 187 prayascitta. The Mit. (on Yaj, II. 243) comments that these verses are not meant to prescribe a total absence of prāyaścitta in the case of children of five or less but are meant to convey that they are not liable for the full prāyascitta prescribed for a sin. Its argument is that the texts lay down generally without any reference to the stage of life that a brāhmana should not be killed or that a person belonging to the three higher castes should not drink surā.18 Hence any one of whatever age who is guilty of having done such prohibited acts is liable and the words of Gaut. II 1 and of Kumāra are to be interpreted as not excusing altogether the drinking of surā by a child but as referring to minor lapses. Brhaspati expressly states that the dictum about a child being allowed to eat what it likes is confined to such matters as will not fall under grave sins, 

It has already been stated above (n 180) that the praya ścitta to be undergone depended upon many circumstances such as the time, the place, the age &c. And first as to age, several smrti3289 provide that a man 80 years old or a boy less than ___187 जनैकादशवर्षस्य पञ्चवर्षात्परस्य च । मायश्चित्तं चरेद् भ्राता पिता धान्य सुहृज्जनः॥ अतो वालतरस्यास्य नापराधो न पातकम् । राजदण्डोन तस्यास्ति प्रायश्चित्तं न विद्यते ॥ शहा quoted by the मिता on या II 243, बृहद्यम III 1-2 (reads aन्यापि वान्धव../ These are quoted by Free on II 6 (without pame) and the first occurs In आपस्तम्बस्मृति III 7 as चरेद्वरुः सुहद्वापि प्रायश्चित्तं विशोधनम् .

History of Dharmaśāstia 

(Vol. 

16 years of ago, women and diseased persons should be liable onls to half the prayascitta (prescribed for able-bodied men) The Mit on Ya, IIT 243 quotes a verse of Sumantu that for a male below twolvo and abovo cighty years of age the penance is half (of that for ordinary men) and one fourth for women within the same limits and a verso of Visnu that for women, old men and diseased persons half the penance should be prescribed and for boys (boforo upanayana ) only one-fourth. Some say that for boys less than five the ponanco is one-fourth Cyafana (prose) proscribes halī prāvascitta for bogs, old men and women and declaros that a person is a bāla up to 16 years and a man is to bo regarded as similar to a bala after 70. Kātrāyana prorided gonorally that the fines to be leried from females were to be half of those loriable from mālo offenders as regards all offences and when the punishment for a male would be doath, a woman criminal was to be punished with the cutting of a limb (nose, ears &c ) 199 

The difference between a sin committed unintentionally (akamatah) and the samo sin committed Tith full knowledge (kāmatah) is this that for the latter the prayascitta is double of what is prescribed for the former as provided by Adgiras, 191 Vyāsa and the Agnipurano, As Yāj. III. 226 employs the rord 'ajñana' in the first half and tho word 'kāmatah' as its opposite in tho socond half instead of the word 'jānatah' it follows that Yāj, inakes no difference between the consequences of yāna (knowledge) and 1āmanā (desire). 

The caste of the ofiender as well as of the victim made 3 difference in the prayascitta as well as in the legal punishment. Vide H. of Dh vol. III pp. 395-399 as to punishments for crimes dependent on caste. Visau 192 provides that the pripascitta for

a ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra sinner should be respectively , 

and of what is prescribed for a brāhmana sinner, The Agni purāna says 193 the same thing. The Par, M II. 1. p. 231 quotes the Caturvimsatimata194 to the same effect. The Mit. on Yaj. IIT, 250 explains that the verse of Caturyimśatimata applies to all cases except where any one of the four sāhasas is committed by a man of a lower caste as against ona of a higher caste. Brhad-Yama (IV. 13-14) in prescribing penance for the kill ing of a cow provides the same scale of 4, 3, 2, 1 for the four Varnas Angiras (verse 3) prescribes the penances of Krcchra and Candrāyana for a brahmana partaking of the food of an antyaga, half of these for a ksatriya or vaiśya guilty of the same. Yaj II 206-207 provide that the punishments for defamation depend upon the higher or lower varda or caste of the offender as well as of the person defamed and that if a ksatriya or yaiśya defames a brāhmana the fines are respectively twice or thrice as high as the fine for a wrāhmana defaming a brāhmana and conversely if a brābmapa defames a ksatriya or a vaiśya the fine is reduced by half in each successive caste. The Mit quoting Angiras says that the rules about punishments apply to prāyaścittas for slaying a person i e, if a brāhmana slays anybody and a certain penance is prescribed for him, then a ksatriya killing the person would have to perform double the penance prescribed for the brāhmaṇa and a vaiśya offender three times as much 195 It may be pointed out here that though the smrtis provided for different punishments according to the castes of the offender and of the person wronged and though some commentaries and digests went into all those details for the sake of presenting a

History of Dharmaśāsird 

[Vol. 

complate statement or digest of the smrti material, such discriminatory punishments had mostly ceased to be enforced by the rulers from about the 12th century A. D. at least, as stated by the Smrticandrikā, the Madanaratna (vyavabāra) and the Sarasvativilāsa. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II p 512 note 924 for the relevant quotations from the three works. Since, as stated above (n. 181), prāyaścittas were to be moulded on the lines of legal penalties, it appears that the discriminatory treatment about prāyascittas depending upon the varna of the sinner must also have gradually fallen into disuetude with the disappear ance of the more severe prayascittas and the substitution of COWB and monetary equivalents in later digests, And some digests expressly state this to have been the case in relation to prāyaścittas. For example, the Pr Prakarada, after quoting Gaut. 22. 14-16 about the prāyaścitta for killing a ksatriya or vaisya or sūdra under certain circunstances, remarks that in its day those prayaścittas vere no longer part of the practices of the people.196 

Whether an act made a man liable to undergo prayas. oitta depended in some cases on the country also. For example, marrying a materna) uncle's daughter yes and is allowed in certain countries and among certain castes in the Deccan and Southern India on the ground of custom, but such a practice was severely condemned by Manu XI. 171-17% and Baud Db S. I 1 17-24 and other smrtis. Brhaspati refers to this custom as prevalent among southerners and states that in these countries persons following it are not liable to undergo prayascitta or penalty (at the hand of the king). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 462 for Brhaspati's verses, 

Severity and extent of prāyascitta depended also on the question whether a sinner had repeated the lapse or was a first offender. The Āp Dh S (II. 10. 27. 11-13) prescribes that & brahmana who has once committed adultery with a married woman of equal class shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for a sūdra having intercourse with a woman of the three upper castos, that for every repetition (of the crime) one

fourth of the pedance must be added and if the commits adultery) for the fourth time, the whole penance (of 12 years must be performed 197). The Mit on Yāj. II, 293 remarks that for a sin that is committed knowingly the prāyaścitta is double of what is prescribed for the same sin if committed unintention ally and that if a sin is committed intentionally and is repeated then for the repeated lapse prāyaścitta is four times as much as that for the same deed done unintentionally. Similarly, the āśrama to which the sinner belonged made a difference in the prāyasoitta as stated by Angiras 'when persons in other āśramas are guilty of sins for which penance is prescribed if committed by householders, then the prāyaścitta is increased in the same proportion that is laid down for sauca (bodily purity198). Manu V.137, Vas. VI. 19, Visnu Dh. S 60 26, Saṅkha. 16.23-24 pro vide that Vedic students, forest hermits and sannyāsins have respectively to perform twice, thrice and four times as much sauca as is prescribed for householders (e. g. by Manu V. 136 

Visnu 60.25). 

One convenient and merciful rule laid down by the smrtis was that if a man died in the midst of the period for which pedance had to be performed (sometimes it extended to twelve years or more he becaine free from the sin here and in the next world as stated by Harita, Vyasa and Yama199. 

Though the smrtis have entered into very great details about the prayascittas for different individual lapses, still they cannot be supposed to have dealt with every lapse. Therefore,

Gaut. (19. 18-20) provides that these acts (viz Vedic recitation, tapas, fasting, gifts &c ) may be optionally performed, then no (particular penance) has been prescribed, that for grave sins difficult pedances and for trivial faults easy ones may be pres cribed and that Krcchra, Atikrccbra and Candrāyana are pen ances for all sins 200 Manu XI 209 (==Visnu 5434) provides that for the expiation of offences for thich no particular atonement has been prescribed, let (the pariṣad ) prescribe a penance after considering tbe (offender's) strength and the nature of the offence. Parāśara (XI, 55-56 ) provides that the recitation of the Garatri ten thousand times is the best penance for all sins and that Candrayana, Yavaka, Tulapurusa and serring cous destroy ail sins Vā). II. 265 provides that a man is purified from all sins by undergoing the penance for cor-killing or by Candrāyana, observance for a month of the milk vrata or by Parāka. Manu XL 117 provides for all upapatakas except the sin of sexual intercourse by one rho is in the stage of Vedic student the penance prescribed for gozadha or cāndrāyana. 

One guilty of a sin, even though he may himself be a learned man, should approach an assembly of learned brāhmadas and after making some present (a cor or the like) anbouncing the nature of his lapse seek their decision about the proper penance for his lapse (Yaj. 21 III 300 and Parasara VIII. 2) The Mit, Par, M., Pr.

Approaching the parisad

not conceal his lapse and lose time; he should bathe with his garment on, and with the garment still wet approach the assembly and should prostrate himself on the ground Thus the elders of the assembly ask the man prostrating himself before them 'what is your business, what is the trouble and what do you seek from us'. The assembly then asks him to go aside a little and debats among themselves what the penance should be, considering all the circumstances of time, place, nature of the lapse, age &c Thon one of them at the desire of the assembly should declare the assembly's decision as to the proper penance after citing the smrti passages and reducing the ponance in view of the weakness and other circumstances of the offender, It has already been stated that the pairsad acted under the direction of the king in matters of prāyaścitta and that the king was not to interfere with the decision of the assembly. The principal stages in a penance were four viz. approaching tho parisad, the declaration of the appropriate penance by the parisad, the actual performance of the penance declared and the announcing of the siuner's freedom froin taint (Angiras q. by Pr. Prakasa folio 27a 'upasthānam vratādesascarya suddhi. prakāśanam i prāyaścittam catuspādam vihitam dharmakartr bhih"). 

It is not necessary here to set out the details of the consti tution of the parisad, of the qualifications of the śistas who were to be the members of the pariṣad and their privileges and duties These points have already been discussed at length ju 

of Dh. vol. II, pp. 966–974. A few matters not stated there are mentioned here Caste exclusiveness and pride had gone so far that Parāśara (VII, 25 ) and the Caturvimsatimata quoted by Par M. state that a duja though he may be of bad character is to be honoured and not a sūdra who may kave controlled his senses, that the advice of a sūdra even though learned and devoted to the knowledge of the śāstras should not be accepted like sacrificial food when licked by a dog 203 In-- stead of the word 'parisad' the word parsad (which is an irre

[Vol. gular abbreviation) is employed in several smrti passages 2030 Parāśara (VL 55-57) provides that the assembly should take compassion on the weak, on boys and old men and should reduce the penance, but not otherwise and that if learned men through affection, greed, fear or ignorance reduce the penance that should be prescribed they themselves incur the sin 2036 Deyala says the same and adds 20% that the reduction in the penance should not be directed by one man alone or by a person ignorant of Dharmaśāstra and that it is only a number of brāhmanas who are proficient in Dharmasastra that are entitled to reduce the penance through compassion for the sinner, The decision of the assembly should be unanimous 205 as far as possible 

If the learned brahmanas of the assembly knowing the proper prāyaścitta do not declare it in the case of those who are distressed by their own sin apd soek direction, they incur sin similar to that of the seeker after proper penance 206,
