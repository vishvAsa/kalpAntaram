CHAPTER IX 

ŚRĀDDIA 

This subject is of groat practical importance from several points of viow. 

The Brahmapurāpa definos śrāddha as follows. whatever is giron with faith to brālmanag intending it to be for the (banofit of) trs at a proper time, in a proper place, to desery ing porsong and in accordance with the prescribed procedure is called sraddha 7st, The Mit on Yāj I 217 defines sraddha As 'abandonment with faith of an article of food or some sub stituto thoroof, intending it for (the benefit of) the departed'. Tho Kalpataru on srāddha defined it as 'the giving up of sacri ficial material intending it for pitrs and its acceptance by brāhmanas'. The Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara and the Srad dhaprakāśa dofine śrāddba in the same way as the Mit, but in a more inrolved manner, Yaj. I. 268 (= Agnipurana 163. 40-41) states that the pntrs via. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas that are the deities of śrāddha, being gratified by grāddha, give gratification to tlio ancestors of human beings. This verse and Manu II. 284 make it clear that the three ancestors of a man,

IV . 10-13) and not अर्धकर्म: similarly, the cremation of an hitagns with his sacrificial vessels is a प्रतिपत्तिकर्म so far as the यज्ञपात्रs are concerned.

Definition of frāddha

viz, the father, paternal grand-father and the paternal great. grand-father are respectively to be identified with the three orders of superintending pitr deities, vix. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, when performing śrāddha. A.ccording to some,752 sraddha denotes three things, viz, hama, the offering of pinda (ball of cooked food) and gratification of brābmapas invited to a dinner; the application of this word to any one of these three can only be in a secondary sense. 

A firm believer in the doctrine of kar ma, punarjanma (re incarnation) and karma-upāka (explained above) may find it difficult to reconcile that doctrine with the belief that by offer ing balls of rice to his three deceased paternal ancestors a man brings gratification to the souls of the latter. According to the doctring of punarganma (as Fery clearly and succinctly put in Br. Up IV. 4.4 and Bhagavad-gitā 2 22 ) 753 the spirit leaving one body enters into another and a new one. But the doctrine of offering balls of rice to three ancestors requires that the spirits of the three ancestors even after the lapse of 50 or 100 years are still capable of enjoying in an ethereal body the flavour or essence of the rios balls wafted by the wind. Further, Yaj. I 269 (which is the same as Mārk, 29, 38, Matsya-purana 19.11-12, Agnipurāna 163, 41-42) provides that the grand fathers (i. e, pitrs) being themselves gratified (by the offerings of food in śrāddha) bestow on men (their descendants) Jong life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, molṣa (final beatitude), all happiness and kingdom. In the Matsya-purana (chap. 19, Verse 2) a question is asked by the sages how food which a brāhmana (invited at a śrāddha) eats or which is offered into fire is enjoyed by departed spirits that might have assumed (after death) good or evil forras of bodies. The answer given (verses 3-9) is that fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand fathers are identified with Vagus, Rudras and Adityas regpectively according to Vedic passages, that the name and gotra (mentioned at the time of śrāddha), the mantras uttered and faith carry to the patts the offerings made, that if one's

History of Dharmadastra 

[Vol. father has become a god (by his good deeds) the food offered in śrāddha becomes nectar and follows him in his state of godhood, if he has become a dastya (an asura) then (the food) reaches him in the form of various enjoyments, if he has become a beast then it becomes grass for him and if he has become a snake the śrāddha food waits on him as wind (serpents are supposed to subsist on wind) and so on. Verses 5-9 of the Matsya, chap, 19 are quoted as from Mārkandeyapurana by the Srāddha kalpalatā p. 5. Viśvarūpa 754 on Yā). I, 265 (p. 171 of Tri. ed.) also raises the same objection and gives several replies. One is that this is a matter entirely based on śāstra and so when sāstra says that pitrs are gratified and the performer gets desired objects no objection should be raised. Another reply is that the gods Vasus and others that have access everywhere have the power to gratify pitrs wherever they may be situated. He does not call the questioners (nāstıla) as some other and later 

writers do. 

The Sraddhakalpalata of Nandapandita 755 (about 1600 A. D.) entors upon an elaborate reply to these persons (whom he dubs atheists) that aver that the performance of śrāddhas for departed fathers and the rest, who according to the particular actions of each go to haaven or hell or to other forms of exist once serves no purpose, He asks: why is śrāddha useless? Is it because there is no prescriptive text laying down an obligation

Does sraddha serve no purpose 

337 

to perform it or is it because śrāddha produces no consequences or is it that it is not proved that putrs and the rest are gratified by śrāddha? To the first he replies that there are such passages as 'therefore & wise mad must perform srāddha with all his efforts that lay down the obligation; nor is the 2nd objection proper, since Yāj. I. 269 does declare the rewards ( of grāddha ) viz, long life &o. Nor is the third alternative acceptable. In the śrāddha rites it is not that the mere ancestors named Deva datta and the like are the recipients and that they are denoted by the words pitr, pitānaha and prapitāmaha, but that those vords denote them as accompanied by the superintending deities FIZ. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas. Just as by the words Deva datta and the like what is denoted is not merely the bodies (so named) nor merely the souls, but what is denoted by the words is individual souls as particularised by the bodies; in the same way the words pitt and the like denote Devadatta and others together with the superintending deities (viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas). Therefore, the superintending deities viz, the Vasus and the rest, being gratified by the food and drink offered by the sons and the rest, gratify those also viz. Dersdatta and the rest and endow the performers (of śrāddha) with such towards as male progeny and the rest. Just as a woman expecting to be a mother becomes gratified by partaking of the food and drink for which she has a longing in pregnancy and which is given to her by another person for the sustenance of the child in the womb, she satiates also the child in her womb and endows those that offer her the food and drink for which she has longings by bestowing on them some reward in return. Thus the pitts denoted by the words father, granda father and great-grand-father are the deities Vagus, Rudras and Ādityas, and not merely (human beings called ) Devadatta and the rest. Hence these deities of śrāddba become the recipients (of gifts) in the śrāddha rite, are gratified by the śrāddha and gratify in their turn the ancestors of human beings. The Srāddha-kalpalatā then quotes 18 Tersee 756 from the

Theory of Śrāddha examined 

any thing on their progeny. It appears very probable that the Worship of ancestors by means of śrāddhas was a very ancient institution and that the doctrines of Punarjanma and Farmauipāka were comparatively later ones and that Hinduisme being all-embracing retained the institution of śrāddhas while adopting also the doctrine of metempsychosis. The institution ef sraddha is from one point of view an excellent one. It provides an occasion for remembrance of one's ancestors and relatives that were dear and near then living The Āryasamaja objects to the institution of śrāddha and interprets pitrs in the Rgreda as meaning living men in the Tānaprastha stage. It may be noted that the texts support both views. The Sat, Br, expressly says that food is offered to the father of the sacrificer in the words 'this is for thee,' Vispu Dh. S. 75, 4 'He whose father is dead may put down a pinda for his father &c,' On the other hand Manu I 284 states that fathers are spoken of as Yasus, grandfathers as Rudras &c and Yaj. I. 269 provides that Yasus, Rudras and Adityas are the pitts and the deratās of saddha. These latter are to be explained as con faining an injunction to contemplate upon the pitys as Vasus, Rudras &c. 

As stated below (p. 347) with regard to the Rgvedic passages, it Tas on account of the supposed poter of pitrs to benefit or harn the living that the cult of the dead became a prominent feature in primitive societies. Offerings and ceremonies which may hare in most ancient times been prompted in part at least by the desire to placate the ancestors are continued as tokens of pare affection and remembrance. Various beliefs about pitṛs are mentioned 75% in post-Vedic Literature, The Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 14 summarizes a brahmana text stating that pits move about in the form of birds, The Auśanasa-smrti and Devala quoted by the Kalpataru say the same thing. In the Vāyu parāns 759 it is stated that at the time of stāddha the ancestors

enter the brāhmanas (invited) after assuming an aerial form and that when the best of brāhmanas are honoured with clothes, foods, gifts, eatables, liquids, cows, horses and villages, pitrs become pleased. Manu II. 189 and the Auśanasa-smrti also support this notion that pitrs enter the invited brāhmadas, The Matsyapurana (18.5-7) enjoins: pipdag should be offered to the departed for twelve days after death, since they serve him as food on his journey and give him great satisfaction, Therefore, the soul leaving the dead body is not taken to the abode of the departed for twelve days (after death ), the departed spirit hovers near his house, his sons, his wife for twelve days. Therefore for ten days after death milk (and water) should be placed (hung up) in space for ten nights for reducing all torments ( or troubles of the departed) and for the removal of the fatigue of the journey (that the departed spirit has to make ). The Visnudharmasūtra 760 (20. 34-36 ) provides *the departed spirit enjoys in the world of pitys the food offered in grāddha with the utterance of the word 'svadha'; whether the departed is in the state of a god or in the place of torments (Hell) or in the form of a lower animal or a human being, the grāddha food offered by his relatives reaches him; when grāddha is performed, the performer and the departed soul both certainly Becure vigour (or prosperity )," 

The Brahmapurāna 761 states that srāddha is to be treated of under five hoads, viz, how, where, when, by whom and with what materials, But before proceeding to deal with these five hoads, it is necessary to dilate upon the underlying ideas and significance of the word 'mtarah' from the most ancient times of which we have literary records, 

The word 'potr' means 'father', but the word 'pitarah' is used in two senses, viz. (1) a man's three immediate decessed ancestors, (2) the early or ancient ancestors of the human race that were supposed to inbabit a separate world (loka) by them

X,15,2 ( translated above pp. 191-92, 194 ) and Rg. IX.97.39.767a 'That Soma which becomes stronger and stronger and makes others strong, that is strained through a strainer, that flows in a stream, protected us by means of the luminary (the Sun)--that Soma with whose help our ancestors knowing the place (where the covs were kept concealed) and the higher regions, harassed the mountain for the sake of recovering) the cows,' In Rg. X. 15 1 the pitts are said to be of three grades, lower, middling or higher. They are also said to be earlier and later ones (Rg. X, 152 ). They are all known to Agni, though a]l putrs are not known to their descendants (Rg. X. 15 13). The patrs are divided into several groups such as Angirasas, Vairūpas, Atharvans, Bhrgus, Navagvas and Dasagvas (Rg. X. 14,5-6), the Angirasas being particularly associated with Yama who is invoked to come to the sacrifice along with the Angirasas (Rg. X, 14, 3-5). In Rg. I 763 62, 2 it is said: 

through whose (Indra's) help our ancient ancestors (pitarah), the Aogirasas, who sang his praises and who knew the place, found out the cows.' The ptys called Angiras were, it appears, again subdivided into two classes viz. Navagva and Dasagva764 both of which words occur in Rg. T. 62 4, V. 39. 12 and X. 62. 6. In several passages the ancient fathers are identified with the seven sages 765 as in Rg. IV. 42.8 and VI 22.2 and sometimes the Navagvas and Dasagvas also are said to be the seven sages (Rg I 62 4). Angirasas are said to be the song of Agni (Rg. X. 62,5) and also of Heaven (Rg. IV. 2. 15). The pitts are often said to regale themselves in the company of gods, 

762. This idea is at least Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-European, The Bacient Parsi scriptures speak of Fravashis that were originally the same as pitrs of ancient Hindu works or the Manes among the ancient Romano, They were the everlasting and deified souls of the dead Gradually the mean lag of Fravasitz was extended and even Gods and objects like the Earth and the sky were supposed to have each a Fravashi, Vide S. B E, vol 4 p. 262 for the Fravashis of the holy Yama and for the different classes of Fravashıs, also S. B. E. vol 23 pp. 180, 184, 230.

I Vol. particularly of Yaina (Rg VII. 76. 4, X. 14 10, X, 15. 8-10) 766 The pitts are said to be fond of Soma drink (Rg. X. 15.1 and 5, IX. 97 39), they lie down on kuśa grass (Rg X15,5), they come with Agni and Indra to partake of the offerings (Rg X, 15. 10 and X, 16.12 ) and Agni is also said to carry the offerings to the prirs (Rg X, 15. 12). Fire is supposed to take the spirit of a crematod person to the prirs (Rg. X 16, 1-2, 5=., V. 18. 2. 10, Rg X. 17, 3). In later works also (e. g. in Mārk, chap. 45), Brahmā is supposed to have created in the beginning four classes viz. gods, asuras, pitrs and human beings Vide also Brahmāndapurāna, Prakriyā, chap. 8, and upodghāta chap. 9. 35 (ityete pitaro deyā devāśca pitaraḥ punah anyonyapitaro hyete). 

It was supposed that the departed spirit, after the cremation of the body, was endowed with an ethereal body and became associated with Yama, the gatherer of departed men (Rg. X. 14. 1 and 8, X. 15, 14, X 16 5), and with pitrs, The departed spirit went to the world of the patrs and Agni was implored to take the spirit to the world of the departed whose deeds were good and to the stride of Vispu (Rg. X. 14. 9, X, 15. 3, X. 16.4). 

Although Yama is said to dwell in heaven (divi) in Rg. X. 64, 3, he is really a god of the middle region, as the Nirukta states. 767 The Atharvaveda states • 768 'let us worship with obejsance the fathers and grandfathers of our father, that enter the wide middle regions, that dwell on the earth and in heaven,' In Rg. I. 35. 6 769 it is said there are three worlds; two of them (Heaven and earth) are in the lap of Savitr; one (i. e. the middle region) is in the domain of Yama where departed spirits congregate, 'The graat Lummary (the Sun) has risen, a gift of the pitrs' (Rg X. 107. 1).

The World of Pitts it is said that the pitrs dwell in the third world from this. This means that after bhuloka and antariksa comes the pitriola. In the Br. Up. I 5.16 three wor]ds of men, pitrs and gods are separately mentioned. In Rg. X. 135, 1-7, Yama is spoken of in somewhat different language. He is in this bymn men tioned as a god by himself and not as the first mortal who made a path (Rg. X. 14. 2) or as the gatherer of men (X 14, 1) or as being in company of the pitrs In a few other places Yama is no doubt called rājan and praised in the same breath with Varuna (Rg, X. 14. 7). But such a position is very rarely mentioned, For the further development of Yama and his assistants as the punishers of men for evil deeds, vide pp. 159-160 above and notes 381-386. 

There is another division of pitrs viz. Piłarah somavantah,771 pitarah barhzṣadah, pitarah agnisvāttāh The latter two are named in Rg X 15 4 and 11 (which occur also in Tai. S. IL 6. 12. 2). The Sat. Br. defines these as follows.-" those that performed a soma sacrifice are putarah somavantah; those that offered cooked oblations (like caru and purodāśa) and secured a world are pitarah barhiṣadah; those that did none of these (two actions) and whom fire consumes when burning them are 'pitarah agnisvāttāh;' these are the only ones that are putarah." 

The Tai.772 Br, has & somewhat similar passage and the Kathaka Sambita IX. 6. 17 also refers to these three kinds of pitrs, Later writers introduced certain changes in the mean ings of the words for the different classes of pit?s and also in creased the number of the classes of piirs. For example, the Nandipurāna g. by Hemādri states: the petrs of brābmapas are called 'agnisvātta', those of ksatriyas 'barhisadah', those of vaisyas 'kavyas', those of śūdras 'aukālin' and those of mle cobas and untouchables are called 'vyāma'. 773 Even Manu

I Vol. (IL, 193–198) mention several classes of pitrs called Somapās, Hayirbhujah Ajyapās and Sukālins with 

pilis, connects 

the four yarpas and in II, 199 states that the pitrs of brūh madas are designated as Anagnidagdha, Agnidagdha, Kārga, Barhisad, Agnisvābta and Saumya Those Ferses of Many appear to summarize different traditions about the several classes of pilys Vide Matsyapurāpa 141, 4 for the samo last four names and 141, 15-18 for their definitions. In Sātātapa. smrti (VL 5-6) twelve groups or divisions of pitrs are mentioned viz. pindabhājah (three), lepabhājah (threo), Nāndimukhas (three) and Aśrumukhas (bree). This is a classification of pitrs from two different standpoints. In Vāyu 72,1 and 73 60, Brahmānda (Upodghāta 953), Padma V, 92-3, Visnudharmo ttara I, 138 2-3 and other Purāpas the classes of pitrs are said to be seven, three of which are formless (antūrlimal) and four have forms (mui tımal) and they and their offspring are des cribed in detail. All this is passed over here. The Skanda. purāna (VI. 216.9-10) speaks of nine groups of pitrs, being Agni svāttāk, Barbisadah, Ayyapāh, Somapāh, Rasmipāh, Upahūtah, those called 'āgantunah', Srāddhabhujah, Nandimukhah. In this list old and new elements are mised up The Indian mind often repels in divisions, sub-divisions and classifications with out much basis therefor and this is probably an illustration of that tendency. Manu (ITI 201) states that from tho bagos tho pitrs sprang, from the pitrs sprang gods and human beings and from the gods arose the whole world whether moving or inmo. vable. It is remarkable that hore the gods are spoken of as springing from the pitrs This is really a moro oulogy of pitr: (i. e, it is an arthavada).

(pañcajadā mama hotram juṣadhyam) and other passages, the Ait. Br. (13.7 or 3.31) explains that they are the five classes, viz. Gandharyas rith Apsarases, pitrs, deyas, sarpas and rākszsas, The Nirukta III. S partly follows this explanation and also gives another. In the Atharvayeda X 6. 32 the gods, pitts and men are mentioned in that order. The ancient Vedic tests and practice make a sharp distinction between the Gods and the Pitrs. The Tai.S. VI. 1. 1. 1 states: 'the gods and men divided the quarters, the gods took the east, pitys the south, men the west and Rudras the north. The general rule is that sacrifices for gods are begun in the forenoon, while the pitr-yajña is performed in the afternoon (San Br.).775 The Sat Br. II. 4.2.2 Darrates that the pitrs wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder (30d under the left arm) and bending their left knee approached Prajāpati, when Prajapati said to them you will hare food at the end of each month (on the Amāvāsyā), your stadhū (cordial) will be swiftness of thought and the moon will be your light,' while to the gods he had said that sacrifice will ba their food and the sun their light. The Tai. Br. 776 I. 3. 10.4 appears to make a distinction between pitrs who are of the nature and position of gods and pitȚs that are more or less like human beings. 

The Kauśika-sūtra (1. 9-23) neatly collects in one place the difference in the procedure of the rites meant for gods and for pitṛs. The performer of rites for gods wears the sacred thread on the left shoulder and under the right armpit, while in the case of the rites for pitrs it is worn on the right shoulder and under the left arm; the rite for gods is either begun facing the east or north, while that for the pitṛs is begun facing the south; the rite for gods is finished in the north-east (or north or east), while that for the pitrs is completed in the south-west; an action is done only once for pitīs, while for gods at least thrice or as many times as the texts direct; in going round (parambulating) the right side is turned towards gods and the left one in the case of piṣs; offerings are made to gods with the words 'svāha' and yaset', while they are made to pitfs with 'stadhā' and

It should not be, however, supposed that the element of fear of the pitss is altogether wanting, 7804 For example, Rg. X. 15. 6 prays 'whatever fault we may commit in reference to you through our being (erring) men do not injure us for that.' In Rg. III. 55. 2 we read 'May the gods and the ancient pitrs who know the place ( of the cows or the path ) not harm us here.' In Rg. x. G6. 14 it is said the Vasisthas praising the gods fashioned speech (hymns ) like pitts and like sages.' Here pitrs and rsis are separate groups and Vasisthas are compared to both.7806 

In many passages of the Vedic Literature the word vita ah is applied to the three immediate deceased male ancestors of a man. Therefore up to three generations they specify (the ancestors) by name; for so many are the ones to whom sacrifice is offered' (vide n. 772 above). The Sat. Br. II 4.2, 1978t mentions the presentation formulas of the cakes to the father, grand-father and great-grand-father and

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. then states that the performer mutters the words "hers, o fathers) regalo yourselves, like bulls come here each to his own share' (Vā), S II, 31 first half). Some (such as Tai, S. I. 8 5.1) repeated the fornuula "this here (ball of rice ) is for thee and (for those) that come after thee." But the Sat, Br, emphatically says that he should not offer with this formula, but rather with the formula 'this here is for thee,' In Sat. Br. XIL 8. 1. 7 the three immediate paternal ancestors are said to be svadha-loving. Relying on these Vedic passages and on the fact that Manu (III. 221 ) and Vispudharma sūtra (21, 3, 75, 4) prescribe the invocation of pitrs after men tioning their gotra and names that the Srāddhaprakāśa (p 13) concludes that it is really the father and the other ancestors that are the deities of śrāddba and not Vasu, Rudra and Aditya, since these latter have no gotra and that the description of the father and others as Vasu, Rudra and Aditya is meant only for contemplation (on them as identical with Vasus &c.). Ona passage of the Brahmapurāna 782 prescribing that the perfor mer should say to the invited brāhmanas that he would call the pitrs to the rites and that when the brāhmanas give per mission to call them he should do so, the Sr. P. (p. 204) remarks that the pitrs bere meant are the divine ones viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas and also the human ones vit, the performer's father and the rest. The Vāyupurāna (56 65-66) Brabmanda and Apu. distinguish between pitrs who are above and patrs vlio are laukika, viz father, grand-father and great-grand-father, Vide also Vayu 70. 34 for pitrs that are like gods. 

In the post-Vedic Literature, particularly in the Puranas, a great deal is said about the origin and classes of pitrs. For example, the Vāyupurāda 56. 18 speaks of three classes of pitrs Vız kāvyāh, barhisadah and agnisvāttāh', while the same Purana, chap. 73, Varāha 13. 16 ff, Padma (Srsti 9. 2-4) and Brabmanda IL, 101 speak of the origin of pitrs of seven classes that dwell in heaven, four of which have a forni (mūrizmat) and three of which are without form (amūrla). The Satātapa-smrti (6.5-6) speaks of 12 pitra viz. pjodabhājah, lepabhājah, nāndimukhāh and aśrumukhāh. All such descrip tions have to be passed over from considerations of space.

Promulgators of brāddha rites 

349 

From the sutra period (about 600 B. C) to the most modern among medieval Dharmaśāstra works the authors wax eloquent over the praiges or the importance or benefits of the institution of śrāddhas. One of the earliest works among these, viz. the Āp. Dh. S gives the following interesting information : 783 "Forinerly men and gods lived togetlier in this world. The gods went to heaven owing to sacrifices (i. e, as a reward of sacrifices that they performed), but men remained behind, Those among men who perform sacrifices in the same way as the gods did, dwell in the other world (i. e. heaven) with the gods and Brahman. Then (seeing that men lagged behind) Madu promulgated the rite which is designated by the word 'sraddha' and which tends to the salvation (or happiness) of mankind. In this rite the Manes (prtarah) are the deities but the brāhmadas (that are fed) are in the place of the āhavaniya fire (in which in sacrifices to gods oblations are offered)". On account of this last sūtra Haradatta (com, of Āp. Dh, S.) and others hold that feeding the brāhmadas is the princi pal act at a śrāddha. The Brahmāndapurāpa (Upodghātapāda 9, 15. and 10. 99) speaks of Manu as the promulgator of śrāddha rites and Visnupurāpa IIL 1 30, Vāyu 44, 38 and Bhagavata II, 1, 2% designate Manu as Sraddha-deva. Similarly, in the Santiparva 345.784 14-21 and the Visnu-dharmottara L139 14-16 it is stated that the institution of śrāddha was established in the Boar incarnation by Visnu and that Visnu should be regarded as dwelling in the three pindas offered to the father, grand-father and great-grandfather From this and from the passage of the Āp. Dh. S cited above we may infer that it was believed even several centuries before Christ that the institution of śrāddhas had a hoary antiquity behind it and that it was as old as Madu, the father of mankind according to the Rgveda (VIII, 63,1, VIII 30. 3.). It is, however, very remarkable that the word *śrāddha' itself does not occur in any undoubtedly authentic and ancient Vedic passage, though the rite called Pindapitr yajña 785 (performed on the amāvāsyā of each month by an

Alitagni), the Mabapitryajña (pozformed in the Caturmāsya called Sākamedha) and the rites called Astakās were known to the early Vedic literature. The word śrāddha occurs in the Kathopanisad (1.3.17) 'whoever proclaims this highly esoteric doctrine in an assembly of brāhmadas or at the time of śrāddha tends to secure immortality.'786 The other early occurrences of the word śrāddha known to me are confined to the sātra literature. The most reasonable and probable inference to be drawn from these facts is this that only a few rites (mentioned just above) were known as related to the pritrs and that there fore no need arose for a generic term in very ancient times to comprehend several rites for the pitrs. But when the number of rites in honour of pers increased, the generic term 'śrāddha' was hit upon, 

A few samples of the panegyrics on śrāddha may be set out here. The Baud. 787 Dh S. states that rites for the Fathers confer long life, heaven, fame and prosperity. The Harivamsa 788 says the world derives support from śrāddha and Yoga (i. e. Moksa) springs from it,' Sumantu 789 quoted in the Smrticandrikā (śrāddha p. 333 ) states nothing else is declared to be more beneficial than śrāddha,' The Visnupurāna (III. 14. 1-4) avers that if a man performs grāddha with faith he thereby propitiates Brahmā, Indra, Rudra and the other gods, sages, birds, men, beasts, creeping animals, hosts of pites and whatever else is styled a being and the whole world. Yāj. I 270 799 promising long life and severa) other benefits arising from gratifying pirs has already been quoted above (p. 337). Yama has a similar verse. It is said in a passage of the Visoudharmottara 791 quoted by the Sraddhasara (p.6) and Srāddhaprakāśa (pp 11-12) that the prinda offered to the

Panegyries of sraddha

great-grandfather is declared to be god Vasudeva himself, the one to the grandfather is designated Saṅkarsana, that to the father is known as Pradyumna and the offerer of the pipdas is bim self in the position of Aniruddha, In Santiparva 345. 21 it is stated that Visnu should be looked upon as staying in the three pindas. In the Kūrmapurāna it is stated 'on the day of Amavasya tho pitrs assuming an aerial form como to the door of their former haunt and mark whether śrāddha is being per formed by men of their family. This they do till sunset. When the sun sets, being oppressed by hunger and thirst, they become full of despair and feel sorrow, breathe heavily for a long time and go away condemning their descendants. The pitrs of him who does not offer srāddha on amāvāsyā, even with water or vegetables, go away after cursing him'. 

It is necessary to say a few words about the derivation of the word 'śrāddha'. That the word is derived from 'śraddha' is quite clear. In the definition quoted above from the Brahma purada and the definition 792 given by Marici and Bșhaspati the connection of śrāddba with śraddbā is emphasized. In śrāddha one entertains the firm faith or conviction that what is given up to the brāhmanas for the benefit of the departed man or the Fathers will reach him or them in some way. The Skandapurāpa VI218.3 says that śrāddha is so called because sraddha is the root (or main spring) of that rite. This means that there is not only the conviction stated above but that there is a firm belief that a person is under an obligation to offer it.

In the post-vedic Literature, Panini explains the forms 'śrāddhin' and 'srāddhika' in V. % 85, in the sense of 'one who has eaten a sraddha dinner' The word 'śrāddha' may be derived from sraddhā according to Pān, V.1.109 795. Sraddha is variously defined in the blūsya on Yogasūtra I 20, 'śraddha' is defined as the composure of the mind 7% (oi men tal approval). Devala defines sraddha: 'confidence (in the efficacy) of religious acts is called sraddhā, one who has 20 faith has no reason (or inotive) for engaging in religious acts ' 797. The Srāddbusūtra 798 of Katyāyana prescribes 'one endowed with śraddhā should offer sraddha even with vege tables (if nothing else is available)'. Vide Manu II. 275 which emphasizes sraddhā for the gratification of pitrs The Mārkandeyapurāna (29, 27 } emphasizag 799 the relation of śraddha to śraddha and states that what is offered at sraddbas becomes transformed into that kind of food for the use of the piers who require food in the new bodies they might have assu med according to the doctrina of karma and punarjanmi and it also remarks that srāddba offered with wealth acquired in an iinproper or unjust way is a means of gratification to the pitrs that are born as capdālas, pakkasas and similar very low grades of people.

It has already been stated above (pp. 349-350) that in very ancient times there were only three rites for departed ancestors, viz. Pinda-pito-Fajās (offered by those who had consecrated the stauts fires) or monthly śraddha in the case of those who had not done so (vide e. g. Āśy. Gr. II 5.10, Hir. GF, II. 10. 1, Āp. Gr. VIII. 21. 1. Visṇuparāna II. 14. 3 &c.), the Mahāpiti ysjõa and the Astaka śrāddhes. The first two have been already described in vol. II (as said above), but the Astaka śrāddhas have not been described at all so far. Therefore some remarks will be offered here about ther. They are of special importance, but the suthorities present great variations on clmost all points such as the number of days and the months in which they were to be performed, the deities to be worshipped, the olierings to be made and the procedure to be followed. 

Gaut. (VII 19) mentions Aṣtaka' rite as the first among the SETED kinds of pakayajfas and as one of the forty saṁskāras. Aṣtaki sppears to have meant the 8th tithi in any month after the Full Moon day (vide Sat. Br. VI. 4.2.10). The Sat. Br. states so 'On the 8th day (after full moon) he (the performer of agricrayana) collects the materials for the fire pan, for sacred to Prajāpati is the Stib day (after full moon) and sacred to Prajapati is this rite viz. the firepan." Sabara in his Bhāṣya on Jsi.S03 I 3.% cites a verse occurring in the A V. . 10. 2 and in the Ap. M. P. I. 20.27 as a mantra indicative of Aṣtaka. The mantra is "May that (Astaka) night be Fery suspicious for us, whom people welcome like a cow coming towards a person and which is the wife of the Year. In the A. V. III. 10. 8 the Ekastaki is said to have the year (Samvatsara ) as husband. The Tui. S. IL 4. 8. 1. provides 802 'Men about to take dikṣi (cousecration) for & Samaisarasattra should undergo dikṣā on the Ekastakū; what is called Ekastakā is the wife of the year.' Jai. (VI 5.3.-37) explains that Ekastakā is the 8th tithr after the Full Moon of Māgha. The Ap Gg. (quoted by Haradatta

This niean's that if the 8th tithi is spread over two-days, then that day on which the thoon is in JFesthā would be called Ekāstakā 804 The Hir.

According to the Asy, Gr. I, 4, 1 the Astakā days (and rites) were four, viz the 8th' tithis of the dark halves of the four months of the two seasons of hemanta and sissia (i. o of Mārgaśirsa, Pausa, Māgha and Phalguna). Mośt of the Grhiya siūas via Mahava Gr. T 8, Sān. Ga 11. 12 1, Khadira Gr. II. 3 27, Kathaka Gr. 61.1, Kauśitaki Gr. III, 15. 1 and Pār, Gr. TII. 3 say that there are only three Astakā rites viz, on the 8th after the Full Moon day of Mārgasirsa (called agrahāyani) i e. in the dark halves of Margaśīṛsa, Pausa (or Taisa) and Magha, The Gobhila Gr. II 10.48 mentions that the Astakās are four according to Kautsa and in all 'flesh is to be offered, but that Gautama, Audgaliamāni and Vatkakhandi prescribe only threa and Gobhila follows tħése latter. The Baud. Gr II. 11. 1 provides that the three Astakā homas are performed in the months of Taisa, Magha and Phālguna, ĀŚv. Gr II. 4.2 refers to an option that 'Astakā rites were performed only on one Astami (aad not on three or four). The Baud. Gr. provides that 836 the rite may be compressed into the three days (7th, 8th and 9th) of the dark half of Māgha or even in one day (ie 8th of the dark 'half of Māśha). The 'Dir. Gr (II 14 2)

describes only, one Astakā rite viz. the "Ekāstakā in the dark half of. Magha. The Bhāradvāja Grhya II. 15 also speaks of only. Ekāstaka but adds that the 8th of the dark half of Māgha on which the moon is in Jyestha is called Ekāstaka. According to Hir. Gr. I. 14 and 15 the one Astaka extended over three days viz. 8th, 9th (on which a cowy was sacrificed for the pitys) and 10th (which, was the Anvaṣtakā). The Vaikhānasa-smārta sūtra (ed. by Caland) IV. 8 says that Astakā is to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Māgha and Bhadrapada or on the 7th, 9th or 10th tithi. 

There is divergence in the offerings also. The Kathaka Gr (61.S), Jaimini Gr. 2, 3 and San, Gr. (II. 12. 2) provide that on the three different Astakās the offerings are of cooked vegetables, flesh and apūpas (cakes), while the Pār, Gr. IIL 3 and Khadira Gr IIL. 3. 29-30 put apūpas for the first Aṣtaka (and hence Gobbila Gr. IIL 10. 9 designates it apupāstakā) and boiled vegetables on the last. According to Khādira Gr. II: 4. 1 a cow is sacrificed. According to ĀŚv. Gr. II, 4,7-10, Gobhila GI. IV. 1.18-22, Kauśika 138.%, Baud, Gr. IL 11, 51-61, on the Sth day very many options are given, viz, either to sacrifice a cow or a ram or a goat; or to offer some jungle flosk that may be available or flesh mixed with sesame and honey, or flesh of the rhinoceros, deer, buffalo, ram, boar, spotted deer, hare, Robita deer, pigeons, śārnga and other birds, or an old red goat; fishes or rice cooked in milk so as to form thin gruel, or gifts only of uncooked corn or fruits and roots, or gold may be offered or only grass for cows or oxep or ons may burn some thickets in a forest or present jars for holding water to those deeply learned in the Veda or should recite the mantras relating to sraddhas, saying 'this is the Astakā. I offer,' but one should not remain without observing the Astakā day in some such manner as the above 807 

It is remarkable that although the Vārtika quoted above, and the Kathakagrhya 61. 1 state that the word 'Astaka' is

History of Dharmaśāstia 

[Vol. applied to a rite in which the pitrs are the deities Forshipped, the greatest divergence prevails as to the devatā of the Astakās, The AST Gr. (IL, 4.3 and I. 5. 3-5) provides that on the 7th of the dark half the offerings are made to the pilys and on the 9th also, but ĀŚv. I, 4, 12 refers to the eight options as regards the deity of the 8th day, viz Viśve-derāh (all the gods ), Agni, Sūrya, Prajāpati, Rātrī (night), Naksatras (constellations), the seasons, the Patrs, Paśus (cattle). The Gobhila Gr III, 10 1 starts 808 by saying that Night is the devatā of Astakā, but adds that there are other views about the deratā being Agni, the Pitts, Prajāpati, Rtus (seasons) or ]] Gods, 

The procedure of Astakā comprises three parts, riz, homa, inviting brāhmadas for dinner (up to seeing them go array after dinner) and the rite called Alyastakya or Anpastakā When the Astakās were deemed to be three or four performed in the several months noted above, all these were gone through at each Åstaka When the Astakā rite vas performed only in one month i. e, after the Full moon in Māgha, the above parts were performed on three days, 7th, 8th and 9th of the dark balf. When compressed in one day only, they must have been per formed one after another on the same day. 

Many of the Grhyasūtras, such as those of Āstalāgana, Kauśika, Gobhila, Hirapyakeśin and Baudhāyana describe a very elaborate procedure in the case of Astakās One of the shortest being that contained in Āp. Gr. (VII 21 and 22 ) is given here by way of sample 508x After defining Ekāstakā ( in VII 21 10) Āp. proceeds: 'He (the performer of the Astakā rite) should perform subsidiary (or preparatory) rites in the evening of the previous day (i e, on the 7th of the dark half). He cooks (or bakes) a cake from rice taken up (from a heap) in four cups; according to some teachers the cake is prepared on eight potsherds (like a purodāśa) After the actions up to the

On the following day he prepares the cow for immolation by touch ing her with a darbha with the words 'I make thee that are agreeable to the Fathers ready (for sacrifice)'. Having silently (i, e, without uttering the word svākā ) offered five 812 oblations of clarified butter, having cooked the omentum of that (cow) and having spread under (the cooked omentum) and sprinkled over it clarified butter he offers it with a palaba leaf from the middle or the end of the stalk with the next verge (i e.

The rites from Svistakrt 815 down to the placing of the pindas are the same as at the monthly śrāddha (described in Āp. Gr. VIII 21, 1-9). Some teachers prescribe that the pindas are to be offered the day after the Astakā (i. e, on the 9th of the dark half). Here follows another method (of celebrating the Astakā rite ). He sacrifices ourds with his joined hands in the same way as he offers the cake. Having left over from the meat (of the cow) as much as may be required, he performs on the day following

I Vol. 

(the. Astakā day) the Anvastakā rite Ita procedure is explain ed by the description of the monthly śrāddha. 

Though Ap. Gr. (II. 5 3) and San. Gr. III, 13, ṇ state that the Anvastakya rite follows the procedure of Pindapitryajāa, some Grhyasūtras (such as Khādira II, 5, Gobhila IV 2-3) give very elaborate descriptions of that rife. The Asy. Gr. and Vispudharmasūtra 74 follow a middle course. The description in Aśv. Gr, is comparatively brief and it is set out below. It may be noted that some Grhya-sūtras state that the Anvastakya rite is performed on the 9th or 10th of the dark half (eg, Khadira Gr III, 5. 1 'navamim daśamim Vānvastakyam)". Further, it may be stated that though most Grhyasūtras call the rite Anyastakya still it is also called, Anvastaka by Pār, Gr. IIL 3, 10, Manu IV, 150, Visnudharmasūtra 74.1 and 76. 1. The most notable peculiarity of this rite is that therein female ancestors are iupoked and offerings are made to them of which Jiquor (sura), scum of boiled rice, collyrium, salves and garlands form part. Though some gūtras (like Āøv. Gr. II. 5) declare that the Astakā and Anvastakya are modelled on the monthly śrāddha or Pindapitryaiña, others (like the Baud, Gr. III. 12, 1, Gobhila Gą. IV. 4., Khadira ILL. 5, 35) say that the Astakā or Anvastakya is the norm which is followed in the Pindapitryajia and all the sraddhas. The Kathaka Gr. (66, 1, 67, 1, 68, 1. 69, 1) averg 816 that the first śraddha, the other śrāddhas (such as gapindikarana), Paśuśrāddha (in wbich the flesh of an animal is offered) and the śrāddha performed every month follow the procedure of Astakā. The Pinda-pitryajña could be offered on anlāvāsyā only by one who was āhitāgni (i. e. had kept the sacred vedic fires). It is impossible to believe that everyone became āhitāgai. The case was probably the reverse i, e. only a few became āhitāgnis and the rest had only the grbya fira or many of the rest were without even the grhya fire. It appears possible that all were required to offer śrāddha on amātāsyā on the analogy of pindapitryajia. As the latter became rare, the requirement of offering srāddha on amāvagyā remained and in the gūtras and smrtis all the details were mentioned under māsiśrāddha and in the case of the other frāddhas the sūtras and smrtis pointed out only what was to bs omitted. It is owing to this that the māgißraddha came to be called the prakrti and the other śrāddhas were called vilries

The Ancaṣtakya śrāddha or variations of the māsisrāddha. Most of the details of the pindapitryajia were required in māsiśrāddha and a few (such as giving arghya, gandha, dipa) were added and more elaborate rules evolved. 

The Anyastakya817 is described in the Asy, Gr. (II. 5. 2-15) as follows Having prepared a portion of the same meat,818 having established the fire on a surface sloping towards the south, havióg fenced it in and made a door on the north side of the enclosed shed, having strewn round the fire three times sacrificial grass with its roots without touching it, turning the left side (of one's body) towards the fire, he should place down the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice mixed with sesamum, rice cooked in milk, meal pap with curds and meal pap with honey. The ceremony should follow the ritual of the Pindapitryajia (vide Aśv. Śr. II. 6). Having sacrificed (part of the foods spacified except meal-pap) with honey let him offer portions of those substances to the pults and to their wives with the addition of liquor and the scum of boiled rice. Some place the portion to be offered into pits, which may be two or six. In those situated to the east he should present the offerings to the pitrs; in those to the west, to the wires. Thereby the cere mony celebrated in the rainy season on the Maghā day in the dark fortnight after the full moon of Prausthapada (i. e. Bhadrapada) has been declared. And thus he should offer (a festival like the Anvastakā ) to the pitts every month, obsery. ing uneven 819 numbers. · He should give food at least to nine (brahmanas) or to any un-aven number of brāhmanas. (Food should be given) to an even number on auspicious occasions 820

or on the performance of meritorious deeds; to an uneven number (on other occasions). The rite is performed from left to right. Barley grains are to be used instead of sesamum. 

The Anvastakya rite was performed after each of the three or four Astakās and if only one Astakā in Māgha were perform ed, then after the 8th of the dark half. 

Thiere are two views about the rite called Māghyāvarsa 821 in Asv. Gr. II, 5. 9. Aoc, to Nārāyada, the rite is performed in the dark half of Bhadrapada for three days on 7th, 8th and 9th.822 The other view is that it is a rite like the Astakās but performed on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapada, when generally the moon is in the Maglā naksıtra. There is doubt about the very name of the site, as the mss. present various forms (vide Oldenberg's note in S. B. E. vol. 29. p 103 on San, Gr. III, 13 1). The real name appears to be Maghyāvarsa, or Moghāvarsa (meaning 'a śrāddha in the rainy season when the moon is in the Maghā naksatı a)'. The Visdu Dh. S 76 1 823 mentions the following times for offering śrāddha viz, (twelve) Amāyāsyās (in a year), the three Astakās, the three Anvastakās, the 13th of the dark balf of Bhādrapada when the moon is in the Maghā asterism, the seasons of sarad and rasanta. In Visnu Dh.

Hir. Gr. . 13, 3. (edited by Kirste) the name appears to be Madhyāvarsa 825 and it is provided that meat is obligatory in it, but that if meat cannot be had then vegetables may be offered. In Pār. 826 Gr. (II. 3) the name (as printed) is madhyāvarsa which is said to be a 4th Astakā in wbich only vegetables are offered. Apararka (p. 422) also appears to call the rite 'madhya varsa. In the Bhavisyapurāna 877 (Brahma-parya), chap. 183, 4 also this rite is referred to but it is said that therein meat is to be offered. It appears probable that this ancient rite on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapads is a precursor of the Mahālayaśraddha of later times, 

If Asyalāyana's view, viz, that there are four Astakās in Hemanta and stśira, were followed and if the Maghyavarsa śrāddha were to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada as Nārāyana holds, then there would be five Astakās in all. Bhattoji in his Caturpimsatimatagangraha says so.823 

Considerations of space forbid the comparison of the above procedure from Ap. Gr. and ĀśY, Gr. with the procedure described in the other Grhyasūtras. It should be noted that several of the sūtras often employ the same mantras in the various stages of the rite (as pointed out above in notes 813-814). 

It must be said that the Astakā śrāddhas gradually fell into oblivion and are not performed now.

which the Astakās and other śrāddhas were copies (vikriis ) with suitable modifications, though a few dissident texts reverse the position, 

In the Gobhilagrhya (IV. 4, 3 ff) another sraddha called 'Anvāhārya' is prescribed after the Pindapitryajõa on the same day. The Sān, Gr. IV. 1. 13 appears also to describe the monthly stāddha as distinct from the Pindapitryajña. Manu (III.122-23) states: 'After performing the Patryajña (i, o, pindapitryajña) a brāhmana who keeps sacred fires shall offer every month on the amavāsyā day the funeral sacrifice Pindanvāhāryaka, 829 The wise call the monthly offering to the Manes Auvābārya and that must be carefully performed with the approved kinds öf flesh mentioned below.' From this it appears that one who has consecrated the frauta fires (i, e. an āhitāgni) was to perform the pindapiryajita in the srauta fires and also perform the same day another sraddha after the pindapitryajña, while those who had not consecrated srauta fires were to perform on amāvāsyā a śrāddha in the grhya 'fire, which was called pipdanyābār yaka or simply apvāhārya and also were to offer pipdapitre yajña in smārta fire (vide Sat. Srauta II, 7, 64 'grhyāgnau anāhitāgneh?). From inquiries made I learn that nowadays most Agnihotrins (at least in the Deccan) do not perform Pinda pitryajõa at all or perform it only once a year and that no one performs the Pindānvāhāryaka śrāddha. It is further to be noted that in smārta yajñas' no one now sacrifices an animal but employs instead māsa grain and there are ahstāgnis who do not offer meat in srauta sacrifices also, but only pista-pasu (an effigy of an animal made of flour). 

The literature on śrāddha is enormous in extent. From the Vedic Sambitās several thousand years ago up to medieval and modern commentaries and digests the various matters connect ed with śrāddha have been dealt with in more or less detail. The Purānas contain thousands of verses on śrāddha. An

adequate and thorough treatment of all this vast mass would fill a separate volume, but considerations of space forbid such an attempt here. All that can be attempted here at the most (and that too not in all cases) is to present matters chronologi cally i. e, describe how śrāddha was dealt with in the Saṁhitās and Brāhmana texts, then in the comparatively older Gshya and Dharma sūtras, then in such early startis as those of Manu and Yāj., then in some representative Puradas, then in the early commentaries of Medhātithi, Vijñāneśvara and Aparārka, and then in the medieval digests. Even in this way only a skeleton of the ceremonies described in some representative work of each class can be exhibited. Many differences of detail which arose owing to lapse of time, the locality, the sakha and usages of each writer, his individual inclination and his ability, will have to be passed over altogether. In the days of the Purāpas the differences in detail in the several śākhās have been adverted to.829a Apart from the smrtis and passages of the Mahābhārata (such as Anuśāsana chap. 87-92) and com montaries on the Sūtras, on Manu, Yāj. and other smptis, the digests on śrāddha are legion, Only the following digests (arranged in chronological order) have been laid under contri bution in this volume: Kalpataru on śrāddha; the Hāralatā and Pitrdayitā of Aniruddha; the Smrtyarthasāra; the Smrticandrikā; the Caturvargacintāmani (section on śrāddha) of emādri (which in the B. I, edition covers 1716 pages); the Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara; the Madanapārijāta ; the Srāddhasāra (a part of Nrsimhaprasāda); Śrāddhakriya-kaumudi of Govindā.Danda; the Srāddhatattva of Raghunandana ; the Śrāddhagaukhya (part of Todarānanda); the Srāddhakalpalatā of Vinayaka alias Nandapandita; the Nirpayasindhu; the Śzāddhamayūkha of Nilakantha; the Śrāddhaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); the Śrāddhacandrikā of Divākarabhatta ; the Smrtimuktāphala (on śrāddha); the Dharmasindhu; the Bālambhatti, a commentary on the Mitāksarā, While presenting this exhaustive and hetero. geneous material, some generalisations, when called for, will be made here and there. It will be seen later on how several minor matters such as whether food should be offered to gods before sraddha, definitions of words like pariritti, visalipati increased the extent of treatises on srāddha,

(Vol. 

We should now turn to the several matters relating to śrāddhas, 

First comes the question as to who are entitled to offer śrāddha (śrāddhādhikarin) This matter has been already dealt with in the E, of Dh, vol. IIL Y 739 ff., and on page 763 and od pp. 256-261 (notes 581-588) above. It would be noticed that some (like the Visṇudharmasūtra ) prescribe that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased should ofīer prindas (i, e. per form sraddha for him), while others said that whoever was preferable as entitled to offer pindas to the deceased propositus was to take the wealth. A few matters not mentioned there may be added here. In the Santiparva 65, 13-21 it is narrated83a that emperor Māndhat was told by Indra bow Yaradas, Kiratas and similar non-Aryan peoples (that are styled Dasyus in the Epic) are to be made to conduct themselves and it is stated that all dasyus may perform Pitryajñas (in which they should feed men of their own kind and make monetary gifts to them) aod offer money to brāhmanas also, The Vāyuporāda (83. 112) also speaks of the Mlecchas as persons that offer oblations to Pitys. The general rule is stated by the Gobhila smrti 61 that the husband should not offer pipda to his wife even if she dies sonless, nor a father to his son por an elder brother to a younger brother. The moral of the story of Nini trho performed śrāddha for his predeceased son and repented for having done so as it was dharmasankara is the same, Vide Anuśāsanaparra 91, Apararka (p. 538) quotes a verse from Şaṭtrimóśan-mata that a father should not perform the śrāddha of his son Ror an elder brother of a younger one, But Brhat parāśara (p. 153) appears to state that even this general rule may have to be set aside sometimes. Baudhāyana and Viddhaśātātapa lg by Sm, C. op śrāddha p. 337) allow a śrāddha (except sapiṇdikarada) to be performed by any one for any

relative through affection, particularly at Gayā. It is emphas ized 832 that he alone deserves to be called putra, who, while the father is alive, obeys his words, and gives plenty of food (to brāhmanas) every year (after his father's death) and who offers pindas (to his ancestors) at Gayā. The general rule laid down was that a child, whose upanayana has not been performed, is like a śūdra and lacks authority to utter Vedic passages (vide Ap. Dr. S. II, 6, 15. 19, Gaut. II, 4-5, Vas. II 6, Visou Dh. S. 28. 40, Manu II. 172),833 But an exception was recognized by almost all these authorities that a son, though his upanayana may not have been performed, can repeat the Vedic mantras required in funeral rites. Medhātithi on Manu L 172 explains that a minor son, even though not initiated into Vedic study by upanayana, can offer water to his father, perform the navaśrāddhas (mentioned above in n. 593) and repeat such mantras as "Sundhantām pitaraḥ' required in these rites, but since he has no srauta or grluya fire of his own he can not per form such śrāddhas as the pārvana. The Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 56) provides that boys whose upanayana has not been per formed, women and sūdras should get śrāddhas performed through a priest or they may themselves perform them without mantras but only mention the name and gotra of the deceased Or with the two mantras 'devebhyo namah' and 'pitrbhyaḥ svadha mamah'. The above discussion shows that men and women, adults as well as children, those who are upanīta as well as those that are anupanīta are under an obligation to per form śrāddha. 

12:23 buddhas a withome 

Tai. S. 1. 8. 5. 1, Tai, Br, I. 6.9 (which will be quoted later on) show that śrāddha was offered to three immediate ancestors, father, grand-father, great-grand-father. The Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5. 113-115) states that there is a group of seven persons closely knit together that is called avibhaktadaya sapindas viz, great-grand-father, grand-father, father, the man himself (who

Manu IX. 137 ( = Vas. 17.5 ** Visnu Dh, S. 15, 46) solemnly 835 affirms: 'by (the birth of) a gon a man wins tlie worlds (heaven &c.), he secures immor tality by a grandson and by the grandson of & son he reaches the abode of the Sun'. This verge shows that all the three descondants of a porson confor equally great spiritual benefit on him. Yāj, also (in I 78) lumps the three together (without making any distinction botween them) when he says since & man securos porpetuation of lineage and heaven by means of son, grand-son and great-grand-son'. Therefore when Manu (IX. 106 ) says that by the birth of a son a man discharges his dobt to his progenitors the Diyabhāga (XI, 34) explains that the word putra stands for the three descendants up to the great grandson, since all the thrbe are entitled to perform the pār vapa-śrāddha and equally benefit the ancestors by the pindas they offer, and that the word putra is not to be taken literally but only as illustrative in order to include the great-grandson, since one may with difficulty find & text expressly mentioning tho adlıkūra of the grandson (as a performer of grāddha and taker of wealth) but there is no text expressly mentioning the great-grandson separately (as the taker of wealth and giver of pinda) 836 On Yāj. . 50 which lays down that when the father dies or has gone to a distant country or is overwhelmed by calamities (incurable diseases or the like) bis debts should be paid by the sons or grandsons, the Mit, adds that even when a son or grandson receives no ancestral property the father's debts must be paid, the only difference being that the son has to pay the principal as well as the interest, while the grandson

has to return only the principal and has to pay no interest and the Mit. quotes & Terge of Brhaspati 87 where all the three descendants are mentioned in one breath and the Mit, adds that the great-grandson has not to pay even the principal if he has received no ancestral property. This last remark implies that tho Mit. regarded that the great-grandson was also included in the extended sense of 'putra'. Yāj. I, 51 begins by saying that whoever takes the wealth of a deceased person has to pay the latter's debts, so the great-grandson would have to pay the great-grand-father's debts if he received the agsets of the grand-father. Therefore the Mit, on II, 50 expressly mentions that a great-grandson need not pay his great-grand-father's debts if he received no assets, because, otherwise being included in the extended meaning of putra, he would have had to pay. There was no necessity to bring in or mention the prapautra under II, 50 if the Mit, did not include the prapautra in the word putra. Again on Yāj. II, 51 ('putrahinasya rikthinah') the Mit. included even prapautra under the word pittra. This shows that the Mit. is quite conscious that the three descendants of a man form one group and succeed to his estate and liabilities and putra includes three descendants wherever the context so requires. If the word 'putra' is not to be taken as only illustrative and as including both grandson and great-grandson, sérious difficulties will arise even in the interpretation of Yaj. on which the Mit. comments. For example, in Yāj. II. 135-136 it is said that when a gonless man dies his wife, daughters and other heirs (named there ) succeed one after another. If 'putra' is taken to mean only 'son' and no one else, then on the death of a man without a son his wife or daughter (whoever is alive) will take the wealth oven if a son's son exists. But that would be absurd and is not stated by any one. Therefore the word putra has to be interpreted in a wider sense in a proper context. Many works such as the Vyavahāramayūkha, the Viramitrodaya, the Dattakamimānsā interpret the word 'putra' as including three generations. Therefore, though the Mit, in its remarks on inheritance and succession expressly names the son and grand

son only (lit, it should have mentioned only the gon) it must by takon as including tho great-grandson also, particularly iz view of tho fact that it rofors to the great-grandson in its commont on Yaj. I, 50 and 51 as taking the riktha which thi Mit. (on Yaj. II. 114) interprets as aptratibandha daya. Baud Manu, Yajneralkya spoak of the three descendants and Saṅkha likhita, Vas, XI. 39 and Yama employ 538 only the word putra or sula in rolation to the three ancestors. Therefore, the remark of Dr, Kapadin in Hindu Kinship' on p. 162 "Vijñāne. svara understands by the word putra song and grandsons only is unjustified. It is impossible to hold with Dr. Kapadia that the Mit, ran counter to the express dicta of renowned Spartis such as those of Manu, Saṅkha-Likhita and Purānas like the Visnu-purina III. 13,30 (quoted above in note 582) and that in its romarks on succession it forgot its own interpretation of putra on Yaj. II. 51. He has also not correctly understood the words of the Mit. introducing Yhj. IL 137: sons and grandsons take the wealth; in thoir absonce, the wife and others; thus it is soid (by mo). This is wrong for several reasons. "Wife and othors take the wealth' is said by YĀJ. (in II. 135-36). The following words aro 'now (the author) declares an exception to both.' This clearly refers to Yaj. (II. 137) and not to Vijñāne øvera and Bo Suktam' algo must refer to Yāj. and not to Vijñānospora. Therefore, according to the Mit, the great-grand son is included in the extended meaning of the word 'putra', is entitled just like a son or a grandson to offer sraddha (in default of a son or grandson ) and to take the wealth and pay the debts of the ancestor. In the matter of payment of debts there ia, on account of the difference in the period that slapses, & difference between all the three descendants if no ancestral wealth is left by the ancestor, viz. the son pays the debt with interest, the grandson only the principal lent but without interest and the great-grandson nothing at all. This shows that even between the son and the grandson that are expressly mentioned by Yā), II. 50 as to the payment of debts there is a difference and that as the great-grandson had to pay nothing when no ancestral property existed he was not mentioned at all in Yā).

Times for sraddhas 

Just as the king is an ultimate heir and also the guardian of all minors, 80 he is like the son of a person (who has no relatives left) for performing sraddhas 

The nest question is about the times when sraddha is to be performed. It has been seen above (vide H. of Dh. Yol, IT. P. 696 ff) that long before the time of the Sat. Br. five daily observances (called Mahāyajñas) were prescribed for each house-bolder, viz the sacrifice to beings, that to men, that to the Fathers, that to the gods and that to Veda 

The Sat. Br. and the Tai, ā, (I. 10) say further that this daily rite in which one offers suadhā (food) to the Fathers even up to water was called pitryaisia. Manu III. 70 defines Pitryajña as tarpana (satiating ancestors with the offerings of water). Manu II, 82 provides that an householder, should daily perform a śrāddha with food or with water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus please the Fathers. Sraddha originally meant & sacrifice performed for the Fathers on Amārāsyā (vide Gaut, 15. 1-2 ).838a By applying that word to the daily offering of water to the Manes what is intended to be conveyed is that the special characteristics of śrāddha in the strict sense are to be extended to this daily rite so far as possible. Amāvāsyā is of two kinds, Sinivāli and Kuhū, Those who keep śrauta fires should perform śrāddha on the former, while those who have not kept srauta fires and sūdras should offer śrāddha on the latter, 

Srāddhas are divided into three classes, nitya, naimitteka and kānya. An observance is called nitya when it is laid down that it must be performed on a certain or fixed occasion ( such as every day, on an amāvāsyā, or on Astakā day). What is laid down for being done on an occasion which is uncertain is celled naimiitika ( such as the birth of a son). What is ordained to be done in case one desires a certain reward or fruit is called hāmija (e. g. the performance of a sraddha on Krttikā or Rohini by one who desires heaven or progeny ). The five daily yaljas including pitr-yajña are nitya i, e, they must be per formed without any eye to any reward therefrom and the

non-performance thereof will lead to sinfulness. Passages mentioning the rewards that follow from the performance of obligatory (nitya) rites are only laudatory, they only convey that such performances make a man pure, but it is not meant that they are not obligatory and may be performed only if a person desires the rewards or results promised (i. 8. Such performances are not kūmya). Ap. Dh. S. (II. 7. 16. 4-7) provides certain times for the performance of śrāddha viz, that it must be performed in the latter half of every month, that the afternoon is preferable for it, that the last days of the latter half of each month are preferable to the first days of the latter half. Gaut. 15. 3 and Vas. XI, 16 say that śrāddha may be performed on any day of the dark half of a month after the 4th day and Gaut. 15. 5 adds that if particularly appro priate materials or particularly holy brahmanas are available or the performer is near a very sacred place (such as Gaya) a śrāddha may be performed on any day. Kūrma (II. 20 23) says the same thing. The Agnipurāna 115. 8 says that at Gayā a ārāddha may be performed on any day (na kālādi Gayātīrthe dadyāt pindāmsca nityaśaḥ). Manu (III. 276-278) provides that the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the 10th but excepting the 14th 8386 ara recommended for sraddha, that one performing a śrāddha on even lunar days (i. a, on the 10th, 12th) and on the even naksatras '(i. e. on Bharadi, Rohini &o.) gains the fulfilment of all his desires, that one who worships the Manes on uneven days (11th, 13th &c) and on uneven constellations (Krttikā, Mrgaśiras &c) obtains PIQ sperous offspring and that just as the latter half of a month is

Trata. This only means that śrāddha should not be performed for anyone on the 14th of the dark halt except for those who were killed by poison or by beasts, spakes, lower animals or brāhmanas or in battle Bata srāddba may be performed on aoy tiths of the dark balf for those killed in battle or by poisOD &c. It should be noted that Mand prescribes (III. 282) that ap āhitāgai should not perform a sraddha except on darśa, from which it follows that only others (who had no srauta fres) could offer sraddha on any day of the dark half. Vide FiraTE VI. 204, 24-27 And VI 219 19-21 for the proposition that saidba should be performed on the 14th tithi of the dark half of Bhadrapada for those who met a violent death by poisoning or fire or were killed by animals having fangs or horns or sho committed suicide.

(I. 217-218), the Kūrma (II 20.2-8), Mārkandeya (28. 20 ff) and Varāhapurana 13. 33-35 sum up in one place the times for performing śrāddhas as follows: Amāvāsyā, the Astakā days, lucky days (such as the birth of a son), dark half of a month, the two ajanas (the two days on which the sun appears to start towards the south or north i e. solstices), possession of sufficient materials (such as rice and pulse or meat), the arrival of a worthy brahmapa, the equinoctial points (visuvat, i, e. the sun's apparent en 'trance into Aries and Balance), the days on which the sun passes into one rāśt from another, the astrological conjunctions called Vyatipāta 838€, Gajacchāyā, eclipses of the sun and the *moon, when the performer has an intense desire to perform

[ Vol. deya 8384 (chap. 28. 22-23), adds that śrāddha should be perforni ed when a man dreams an evil dream and when evil planets affect the naksatra of his birth. In an eclipse the appropriate time for śrāddha is what is called Sparsa Kala 839 (i e, when the eclipse begins), as stated in a verse of Vrddha-Vasistha. The Brahmapurāpa (220. 51-54) contains all the times specified by Yāj, and a few more. Vide also Skandapurāna VII. 1. 30-3%, Visnupurāna TI, 14, 4-6, Padma (srsti 9. 128-129). Acc. to Visou Dh. 8.76.1-2, Amāvāsya, the three Astakās and the three Anvastakās, the 13th day of the dark half of Bhadrapada on which the moon is in Maghā, Sarad and Vasanta are obliga tory (mutya) times for sraddha and that if a person does not per form śrāddha on these days he goes to Hell. Visnu Dh. S.(77,1-7) states that the day of the sun's passage from one sign of the zo diac to another, the two equinoctial days, particularly the sols ticia) days, Vyatipāta, the constellation on which the performer is born, a time of rejoicing (son's birth or the like)--these are Icāmya times and a śrāddha performed on these occasions gives infinite pleasure (to the Manes). The Kūrmapurāna (Uttarārdla 16. 6-8) says that śrāddhas called kānya are commended on eclipses, solstice days, equinoctial days and on Vyatipate and they give infinite pleasure (to the Manes) and śrāddha per formed on-Saṅkranti (sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac to another) is inexhaustible and so also on days of birth and on the several naksatras śrāddhas should be performed. Āp. Dh, S. II. 7. 16. 8-22, Anusāgana 87, Vāyu 89. 10-19, Yāj I 262-263, Brahmapurāna 220.15-21, Visnu Dk. 8.78.36-50, Kūrmapurāna (IL 20.17-22), Brahmānda II. 17.10-22 state what rewards & man gats if he performs śrāddhas on each of the days from the first to the 15th of the dark half These lists do not completely agree with each other. That of Ap. being probably the most ancient, is set out hereSrāddha performed on each of the 15 days of the dark half respectively yields the following results in order, viz. progeny chiefly consisting of females (on 1st tithi

Amāvāsyā). Gārgya (a by Par. M, I. 2 p. 324) provides that one should not perform śrāddha on Nandā, on Friday, on 13th of the dark half and on the naksatte of birth and the preceding and the following naksatras for fear of losing one's sons and wealth. The Napdā tithis are 1st, 6th and 11th. The Anuśāsana-parya (87.16) provides that he who performs brāddha on the 13th tithi attains pre-eminence among his agnates, but then the young men in his house die as a consequence. 

The sraddhas performed on the days mentioned in Visnu Dk. S. 77. 1-6 are naimittaka and those performed on certain tulhes and days of the week for securing certain rewards would be kāmija śrāddhas, According to Par M. I. 1 p. 63 the per formance of obligatory (nitya) actions is samskāraka (i a, offects a purifying change in the mind making it fit for higher things ), while in some cases it may also produce the desire to know the Reality bebind the appearances (i e, it is 'vividisā janaka' as indicated by the Gstā 9, 27). Jaimini (VI. 3. 1-7) establishes the proposition that the nitya acts (such as Agni hotra, Darśa-pūrnamāsa-yāga) must be performed even though the performer is unable to perform a subsidiary part of the rite; while Jai, VI. 3. 8-10 provide that every part of Kamyu actions must be performed and if the performer thinks that he would be unable to perform all he should not undertake to perform a kāmya rite at all. 839a 

The Visoudharmasūtra (78. 1-7) states that one performing śrāddha on Sunday secures everlasting freedom from dis ease and those who perform śrāddha on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (Jaiva), Friday and Saturday respec

The Visnu-Dharmasutra (78. 8-15 ) mentions what rewards follow from performance of śrāddhas on the 28 naksatras from Krttikā to Bharani (including Abhijit which is placed after Uttarāsādha and before Sravana). Yāj I 265–268, Vāyu chap. 82, Mārkaddeya-purada 30, 8-16, Kūrma (II. 20 9-15), Brahmapurāda 220, 33-42, Brahmānda ( Upodghātapāda 18.1 ff) also deal with the same topic, but all these works do not present complete agreement For example, Visnu Dh S. and Yāj. agree that śrāddha performed on Krttikā, Rohini, Asyini and Bharapı yield as rewards heaven, offspring, horses and longe vity, but they disagree in several others e. g. while Vispu says that prosperity, beauty (or happiness ) and all desires are obtained by performing śrāddha on the Pusya, Aślesā, and Magbā naksatras respectively, Yā), provides that a śrāddha on these three yields strength, son and eminence. The Anu śāsanaparya 89 and Vayupurāda 82 set out the rewards of srāddhas on the several naksatras from Krttikā as declared by Yama to Sasabindu. 

It is stated in the Agnipurāna 840 that srāddbas performed at a holy place and on days that are called Yugādı and Man vādi yield inexhaustible gratification (to the pritrs) The Vispupurāna 641, Matsyapurāna (17. 4-5), Padma V, 9. 130-131, Varahapurāpa and Prajāpati-smrti verse 22 and Skanda VII 1. 205 33-34 state that the third tithi of Vaisakha (bright halt), the 9th of the bright half of Kārtika, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada and 15th tithi of the dark half of Māgha are called Yugādi tithes (ie the first days of the four Yugas from Krła).

The orders in the Skandapurāna VII, 1. 205. 36-39 and the Smrtyarthagara (p. 9) are slightly different. In the Skandapurāna (Nāgarakhanda) the first tithis of thirty kalpas from Sveta onwards are specified as fit for śrāddha, but are passed over here.

S. 77. 8-9, Kūrma (II, 16, 3-4), Brahmānda III, 14, 3, Bhavisya I, 185. 1 forbid the performance of śrāddha at night or at twilight or when the sun has just risen except in the case of an eclipse of the moon, Ap. adds that when once a sraddha is begun in the afternoon and owing to some cause there is delay and the sun sets then the performer should perform the reinaining rites the next day and he should observe & fast till the placing of the pindas on the darbhas. Vispu Dh, S. declares that śrāddha performed during an eclipse satisfies the Manes as long as the moon and stars exist and brings to the performer all advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires, while the Kūrmapurāpa threatens that he who would not perform & śrāddba in an eclipse sinks (inours sins or becomes ruined) as a cow in mud, The Mit. on Yā). I, 217 is careful to point out that though there is a prohibition against eating during the progress of an eclipse of the sun or moon, that prohibition would only affect the eater (the brāhmapa who eats śrāddha repast in an eclipge) but not the giver who will secure happiness (or good results) thereby.843

History of Dharnatāstra 

[Vol. Very learned disquisitions are held in Aparārka p. 465 ff, Hemādri p. 313 ff and other writers and digests as to the mean ing of aparāhna which is the time for sraddha prescribed by Manu (III. 278). There are sevoral views. Some hold that the part of the day after noon is 'after-noon.' The word 'pūrvahna' occurs in Rg. X. 34. 11. Others relying on a śruti 84 text * The forenoon is for gods, mid-day for men and afternoon for pitrs' hold that the third part of the day divided into three parts is 'aparāhva. A third view is that aparāhga is the 4th part of the day divided into five parts and they rely 845 on Sat. Br. 11, 2.3 9. The five parts are called prātah, sangava, madhyandına (or madhyāhpa), aparāhna and sāyāhng (or sayam or astagamana). The first three are expressly mentioned even in the Rgveda V. 76.3 Prajāpati-smrti (verses 156-157) says that each of these five parts extends over three muhur tas (the day being divided into fifteen muhūrtas). It further states that hutapa is the 8th muhūrta from sunrise and that śrāddha should be begun in kutapa and should not last beyond Rauhida muhurta and that five muhurtas (from 8th to 12th) are the maximum time for śrāddha, 846 The word kutapa has eight meanings as noted by tle Sr. C. (śrāddha) p. 433 and Hemādri on śrāddha p. 320. The word is derived from 'ku' meaning "condemned' (i. e, sin) and 'tapa' means 'what burns. The eight 47 meanings of 'kutapa' are 'midday, a vessel of rhinoceros horn, woollen seat or blanket

from Nepa), silver, darbhas, sesame, cows and daughter's son.' The general rule is that śrāddhas are performed in the afternoon (but this applies to śrāddha on New mooni, Mahālaya, Astakā and Anyastakā śrāddhas ), while Vrddhisraddha and śrāddha in wliich only corn is offered (āmasraddha ) are performed in the inorning. Medhātithi on Manu III, 245 quotes a smrti text on this 848 The Trikāpdamandana (II. 150, 162) provides that when it is not possible to perform a religious rite at the time prescribed for it as appropriate, it should be performed at some other time thereafter and that, between the proper time of a rite and the means, the former is to be preferred and one should not wait for a time later than the proper one with the desire of being able to collect all the principal materials. 848a 

A few words must be said about the proper places for the performance of a śrāddba. Manu (III 206-207 ) lays down that the performer should make efforts to secure a spot sloping to the south and smear it with cowdung, a spot that is pare and unfrequented (by many persons) and that the Fathers are pleased by grāddha at naturally clean spots or the banks of rivers and spots that are unfrequented. Yāj. I. 227 very briefly puts the requirements by saying that the place of śrāddha should be covered on all sides, should be pure and sloping to the south. Saṅkha says : 849 'one should not perform śrāddha on the backs of bulls, elephants and horses, nor on raised earth platforms nor on land owned by others' The Kūrmapurāna states 850 'Forests, sacred mountains, holy places, temples—these have no (definite) owner and they cannot be private property (of any one ), Yama provides 851 'if one offers śrāddba to his petrs in spots

belonging to others, that śrāddha rite is destroyed by the pitrs of the owner of those spots. Therefore, & man should perform grāddha on holy spots, on river banks, in sacred places and particularly in land belonging to himself, in bowers near hills and on mountain tops' The Vishudharma-sūtra chap 85 mentions numerous holy places and then adds 'in these and other ti thas, big rivers, on all natural sandy banks, near streams, on mountains, in bowers, forests, groves and spots that look charming because of being smeared with covdung (śrāddha may be performed )' Saṅkha (14 27–29 ) states

The Brahmapurāna ( 220.5-7) also specifies river banks, lakes, mountain tops, sacred spots like Puskara as the proper places for śrāddha. The Vāyupurāna, chap 77 and Matsya 22 contain Jong lists of sacred places, countries, moun tains in relation to srāddhas. The Kalpataru (śrāddha p. 40) and Sr. P. p. 147 state that special characteristics of the tirthas in the several countries that are declared to be fit places for srāddha should be understood from the inhabitants of those various countries.

The Vispudharmasūtra 852 ( chap 84 ) prescribes that ślāddha should not be performed in Mleccha country, nor should one go to & Mleccha country and then defines a Mleccha country as one in which the system of the four varnas is not established and states that Āryāvarta is beyond that The Vāyupurāna provides 883 that the country of Triśanku sluch 18

Magadha ) is not fit for śrāddha, similarly the countries called Kāraskara, Kalinga, the country to the north of the river Sindhu and all countries where the system of varnas and āśramas is not in existence should be sedulously avoided for śrāddhas, The Brahmapurāpa (220.8-10) makes the somewhat startling remark that the following countries should be avoided for śrāddhas viz, the Kirāta country, Kalinga, Konkapa, Krimi (Krivi?), Daśarpa, Kumārya (Cape Comorin), Tangapa, Kratba, tlie northern banks of the Sindhu river and the south bank of Narmada and the east of the Karatogā, 

The Mārkandeyapurāna 854 prescribes that for a śrāddla a place (ground) that is full of insects, that is arid, or is burnt by fire, from which proceed sounds that are painful to the ear, that is terrific in its aspect, that omits fetid smell should be avoided, 

It was also provided from very early times that certain persons and animals are to be ejected from the place where srāddha is to be performed and are not to be allowed to polluto tlie śrāddha rite by looking at it or by disturbing it in various other ways. Gaut. (15. 25-28) provides that food seen by dogs, cāndalas and those guilty of mahāpātakas becomes unclean (and so unfit); therefore one should offer śrāddha in a covered (or screened) place; or he should strew round about the place sesame or a worthy brāhmana who purifies a row of diners by liis presence should perform a śānti for removing the taint caused by a dog or cāndāla seeing the food &c). Āp. Dh. S, prescribes that the learned condemn the seeing of a śrāddba by dogs and those who (being patta) are excommunicated and that a leper, a bald man, one having sexual intercourse with another's wife, the son of a brāhmapa who follows the profes sion of arms, the son of a brāhmana wonan from a sūdra man if these eat śrāddha food they pollute the diners sitting to eat in a row, Manu ( II. 239-242) states : 'a candāla, a village pig or cock, a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, an impotent person-these should not be allowed to see brāhmanas engaged in taking dinner, Whatever is seen by these at a homa

If a servant of even the person who offers srāddha is lame or squint-eyed or has a limb less or more (i, e. Having eleven or nine fingers &c.), be sliould be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be per formod. It is provided by the Anuśāsanaparva (127.13) that śrāddha food should not be seen by a woman in her monthly illness or by a sonless woman or by one suffering fron white leprosy. Vispu-dharnasūtra (82, 3 ff) contains a long list of about 30 persons who are not to be allowed near a śrāddlio, The Kūrmapurina (II. 22, 34-35) states that one devoid of a limb, & patila, a leper, one suffering from an open ulcer, an atleist, a cock, a pig, a dog, should be kept far away from a śraddha; one should also avoid one that has a disgusting appearance, an impure person, one who is naked, a mad man, a gambler, a woman in her nonthly course, those that wear indigo-coloured or yellow-red garments and those wbo follow heretical views. The Mārkandeya 32 20-24, Vayu 78. 26-40, Visnupurāpa III, 16. 12-14 and Aduśāsanaparva 91 43-44 also contain long lists which are passed over here. The Skanda purāna VI 217, 43 also speaks about a dog, a woman in her inonthly illness, a patita and a hog not being allowed to see the grāddha rito. 

The classification of Sraddhas. Sraddhas have been variously classified. One classification, viz, into nutya, nazmıttrica and Lamya has already been desoribed above (p. 369) Another classification is that into Ekoddista and Pāryana 855. The first is offered to one deceased person alone, while the latter is performed on the amāvāsyā of a montlı or in the dark half of Bhadrapada or on sankrānti and in it the three paternal ancestors are principally invoked.

The Sraddhaviveka, remarks that the sixteen pretaśrāddhas (to be described later on) are included under naimittika and that such śrāddhas as Gosthi. śrāddha epumerated in other smrtis are included in Pārvana. The Kurmapurana (II. 20. 26) similarly speaks of the five sraddhas as enumerated by Manus57. The Mit. on Yay. I. 217 states that there are five śrāddhas, viz, "ahar-abah-śrāddla, pārvana, yrddhiśrāddha, skoddista and sapipdikarana. Tho daily sraddha is deseribed by Manu III. 82 (= Saṅkha 13 16 and Matsya 16,4) as one that is performed every day with food (cooked rice, yavas &c.) or with water or with milk, fruits and roots. Two verses of Viśvāmitra858 quoted by several works speak of twelve kinds of Sraddhas, viz. nitya, naimittika, kānıya, yrddhi-śrāddha (performed on the birth of a son, marriage or similar incident of good luck ), sapindana (sapiddi karana), pārvana, gosthisraddha, suddhisraddha, karmānga, daivika, yātrāśrāddha, pustiśrāddha.

That is called daivika śrāddha which is intended to propitiate gods (it is like nityaśrāddha and is performed on the oth or 12th tothor or the like vitu sacrificial food ) When a man going to a distant country on a pilgrimage or the like performs a śraddha in which clarified butter is served (to brāhmadas) in abundance or when he comes back to his house, that is yātra śrāddha, That is called pustiśraddha which is performed for the liealth (or fattening) of the body (when taking some medicine for the purpose ) or for the increase of one's wealth. Out of thega 868 telve the principal ones are pārvana, ehoddista, zrdilhe and saprudana. There are works called Şab-Dayatı-sraddha such as those of Sivabhatta, son of Govinda, and of Raghunātha.

the 12 amāvāsyās in the year, the four sraddhas on the Yugādi days (note 841 above), the fourteen śrāddhas on the Manvantarādi days (p. 375 above), the śrāddhas on 12 sankrantis (i. e. the sun's apparent motion from one sign of the Zodiac to another), the 13 śrāddhas on the Yoga called Dhrti (i. e. Vaidhrti) and the 13 śrāddhas on the .Vyatīpāta yoga, the 16 Mahālaya śrāddhas, the four Anvastakā days (according to Aśv. as noted on pp 359-360), the four Astakā days and the four days (i e, 7th of dark half of the months of Hemanta and Sisira) of the day previous ( to the Astaka). These classifications and enumerations of śrāddhas will afford an idea how the doctrine of śrāddhas was carried to an exaggerated extent in the course of centuries. It goes without saying that only a few people could have indulged in the luxury of so many śrāddhas a year and most people were content with the performance of only one Mahālayaśrāddka and one or two more. It may be noted that Manu (II. 122) first prescribed that on the amāvāsyā of each month an elaborate śrāddha should be performed, but knowing that this was almost impossible Manu recommends to all (IIL. 281 ) that an elaborate śrāddha should be performed on three amāvāsyās in one year 862 (viz. in Hemanta, Grisma and Varsa) and one should perform every day the śrāddha which is one of the five daily sacrifices (III. 82-83). Devala went further and recommended that an elaborate śrāddha may be performed only once a year, 

The next important question is about the qualifications of the brāhmanas that were invited to dinner oz & śrāddha day. Only brāhmadas were and are entitled to be invited for śrāddha

Who should be invited at śrāddha

who has studied the Veda and is able to teach the whole Veda with its angas, a Srotriya-mthese persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral repast. Gaut. 15. 28, Baud. Dh. S. II. 8.2, Manu II 185–186, Yāj I, 219, Varahapurāna 14,2 contain almost the same words about those who sanctify the company of diners (ie who are panktipõrana). The Anuśāsanaparya (90.25-31), Kūrmapurāpa II. 21.1-14, Matsya 16 7-13, Brahmapurāna 220. 101-104, Vāyu 79. 56-59 and 83, 52-55, Skanda VI. 217, 21-25 give long lists of panktipāvana brahmanas. The Hir. Gr. I. 10.2, Baud, Dh. S. II.2.7, Kārma (IT, 21. 14) and others say that & performer of sriddha should invite one who is not a relative connected by marriage (such as & maternal uncle) nor one who is of the same gotra, nor one who is connected with the performer by Veda study (i. e. is his teacher or pupil), nor a friend nor one Tho expects monetary help from the performer. Manu (III. 138-139 ) provides that one should not invite at & śrāddha dinner & personal friend, that one may gain a friend by making Taluable gifts to him (on other occasions), that one should feed at a brāddha & brahmaba whom he does not deem either his friend or foe and that he who performs grāddhas and offer ings to gods chiefly to gain friends reaps no reward after death by those sraddhas or offerings, But Manu IIL 144 (= Kūrma II 21-22) provides that one may invite even a friend but not a foe though the latter may be learned. Manu (II. 135–137 and 145–147 ) lays down that the main or best rule to be followed is to present śrāddha food to those who are devoted to spiritual knowledge, that between a man who has studied one whole recension of the Veda but whose father was not a śrotriya and one who is himself not a śrotriya but whose father had studied a whole recension of the Veda (i.e.whose father was a śrotriya) the latter is the more worthy of the two, that one should strive to feed at a sraddha an adherent of the Rgveds who has studied one entire recension of that Veda or a follower of the Yajurveda who has studied ons Sakha thereof or a singer of samans who has finished one recension of the Samaveda and that if one of these preceding three is honoured and dines at a sraddha, the ancestors of the performer will be gratified up to the seventh generation for a very long time. Harita (q. by Hemādri on śrāddba p. 392 and Kalpataru on śr. pp. 66-67) describes the qualifications of those who are pankteya brāhmanas viz, they must be born in a high family (possessing four characteri stics), must be endowed with learning (of six kinds) and sila

[Vol. 

(character of 13 kinds) and good conduct (of 16 kinds). Sabkha Likuita 863 give a long list of pānkteya (fit to be associated with in a parhti i. e. Tow of diners) brāhmaapas, viz he who knows the Voda and the Vedāngas (viz. phonetics, kalpa oi śrauta ritual, grammar, Nirukta, metrics and astronomy); one who keeps the five fires; one who has studied the Veda with its angas; one who koos Saṅkhya, Yoga, Upaniṣads and Dharma śāstra; a śrotriya, & trināciketa, trimadhu, trisuparpaka and one that has studied Jyesthasāman; one who has studied Sāókhya, Yoga, Upanisads and Dharmaśāstra; who is devoted to Yeda; who always keeps sacred fires; who is obedient to his parents and devoted to Dharmasastra. Similar rules are laid down by Visnu Dh. S 83, Bṭhat-Paraśata p. 150, Vļddha-Gau tana p. 581, Prajāpati verses 70-72, Laghu-Satātapa yerses 99 100, Auśanasasmrti (Jiv, vol. I. pp. 523-524). As Medhātithi ! on Manu III, 147 says the gist of all these passages is that a learned brāhmana who has studied the Veda, whose conduct is good, whose family is famous, who is the son of a śrotriya father and who is not related to the performer must be invited and all the rest is mere arthavada (by way of eulogy). Madu (II. 128) laid down two propositions yiz. all food offered as sacrifice to the gods and modes must be given only to a brāh mapa who studies the Veda and that whatever is presented to the most worthy brāhmana (among brāhmanas studying the Veda) brings in the greatest reyards. Then Madu (IL 183) declares that parkirpāvana brahmanas are those that sanctify a row of diners among whom sit some who ars tainted by (latent) blemishes that make them unfit to be among the diners. Then Manu (IIL 184-186) gives examples of panktipāvana brāh manas viz. those who are the foremost among students of all the Vedas or their expository works and who are born in a family of unbroken descent of Vedic students, who are Trina ciketa &o. Hemādri (on śr. pp. 391–395) and Kalpataru (śr. pp. 64-65) quote numerous verses from Yama on panktspāvana. 

Manu III, 147 asserts that the best course is to invita & brāhmana who fulfils the conditions laid down in Madu III.

132-146, but adds that if it is not possible to secure such a brāhmada then the next best course 865 ('anukalpa') may be followed, viz. the performer may invite his own maternal grand father, his maternal uncle, sister's son, father-in-law, bis teacher of the Veda, daughter's son, son-in-law, a bandhu (such as mother's sister's son), wife's brother or a sagotra, or his family priest, or his pupil. Similar provisions oocur in Yāj I. 220, Kūrma (Uttarārdha 21, 20), Varāhapurāna 14, 3, Matsya 16. 10–11, Visnupurāna II, 15. 2-4 (anukalpesyanantarān). But Manu is careful 866 to point out in a later chapter that one who is able to observe the best course, but observes the second best does not reap other-worldly Jewards by his actions. Even Āp. Dh, S. 867 expressly says that if strangers do not possess the requisite qualifications, then even one's full brother possessed of all the qualifications (as to Vedic learning, good conduct &c.) and pupils may be fed at a śrāddha. Baud. Dh. S. also allows even a sapiṇda to be fed.s68 Gaut 15. 20 appears to be of the view that even pupils and sagotras may be invited when they are possessed of excellent qualities and strangers with good qualifications are not available. Even in these times yery learned brāhmaṇas are un willing to be fed at a śrāddha, particularly within a few years (three or five) from the death of the person for whose benefit the grāddha is to be performed. Smśtis attach a certain stigma to the fact of being the recipient of a śrāddha dinner and prāyasoittas are prescribed. For example, the Mit, on Yāj, IL 289 quotes several verses of Bhāradyāja, one of which says 'If a brāhmana dines at a pārvana śrāddha he has to perform six prādāyāmas (as expiation), if he dines at a śrāddha from the third month after a person's death to one year, he has to undergo a fast; if he dines at & viddhiśrāddha, he has to per form three prādāyāmas, and a fast for a day and night if he dines at a sapindana śrāddha,' The Mit, further quotes a

[Vol. verse from Dhaumya which prescribes Cāndrāyana for dining at a śrāddha on the birth of a son or at slaantonnayana, in & navaśrāddha etoVide also Nirnayasindhu II, pp. 467-468 for prāyaścittas on eating srāddha dinners, The Varāhapurāna (189, 12-13) provides that if & brāhmana dies while the food offered to & preta is still in his stomach he dspells for a halpa in a horrible hell, becomes a raksasa and then becomes froe from the sin, 

According to Gaut, 15. 10 young persons with the requisite qualifications are to be preferred to older ones, while, according to some, young men were to be invited at a śrāddha for one's deceased father and old men for a śrāddha for one's grand father. On the other hand, Āp. Dh, S. says among brāhmadas possessing the same qualifications, the older ones are to be preferred and among those that are old are to be preferred the poor that are anxious to earn money. 8682 

Some of the works lay special emphasis on inviting ascetics or yogins at a śrāddha dinner. The Visnu Dh. S states that yogins 869 are particularly paiktupāvana and quotes a stanza as recited by the pitrs "May (a, descendant) be born in our family who feeds a brābmana yogin at a śrāddha by which ye are ourselves satisfied,' The Varāhapurāna 14. 50 says that a yogin is superior to 100 brahmanas. The Mārkandeya-purāns provides a wise man should always feed yogins at a śrāddha since the pitrs rely for support on Yoga; if & yogin is fed by being seated as the first among thousands of brāhmanas he saves the performer and the other diners as a boat saves men in water.' Then it quotes stanzas sung by the pitrs (29. 32-34) to king Aila. The Saurapurāna, after mentioning the qualifioa tions (in 19.2-3),870 winds up by stating that even one may suffice provided he be a single-minded devotes of Sivā (verse 6)

Who should be invited at śrāddha 

389 

The Matsyapurāpa (16. 11-12) recommends 'He who expounds (the meaning of) texts; he who enters upod the discussion of srauta sacrifices and he who knows the rules about the accents of sāmans is a purifier of panktipāvanas; one proficient in the Sāmaveda, a Vedic student, one endowed with knowledge of the Veda or of Brahma 

where these are fed in a frāddha it yields the highest benefit.' 871 Though in the above passages the greatest emphasis was laid on the possession of Vedic learning by the brāhmanas to be fed, one had also to see whether they were men of good character and observers of the rules of proper conduot, as provided by Aśv, Gr. IV. 7, 2 (note 862), Gaut. 15.9 and Manu L. 118 who says 'a brāhmana 872 knowing only the sacred Gayatri but living a well-regulated life is to be preferred and not one who knows the three Vedas but who is not well-regulated in conduct and who eats anything (even forbidden food ) and who is a vendor of everything.' The Skandapurana VI. 217. 27 recommends that one should make every effort to know the family of the brāhmanas, then their character (śila), then their age and then the facts about whom they marry or to whom they give their daughters in marriage. The Brahmānda (Upodghāta, chap 15) says that there should be no scrutiny of a brāhmapa about whom nothing is known because sıddhas (yogins) roam about on the earth in the form of brāhmanas. But if faults in a brāhmana are easily seen or if one knows his disqualifica tions on account of one's dwelling near him, he should not be invited (versos 5-6). The same Purāpa (Upodgbāta 15. 24-26) arranges the orders of preference as follows: first yati (ascetic), then a brāhmana who knows the four Vedas and itibāsa, then one who knows three Vedas, then one who knows two, then one who knows one Veda, then one who is an upadhyāya. Hemādri (on srāddha p. 443) quotes the Agni purāpa 873 as follows: 'what is the use of birth in a) famous

family if the man is himself devoid of good conduct? Ara not ipseots found in fragrant flowers ?' Jatukarnya says 'one should not honour even with a word (much less with food &c.} in rites for gods and Manos bad brābmanas void of good eonduct, even though they be endowed with learning and be born in a good family. This insistence on worth was due to the conception that pitrs assuming an aerial form enter brahmanas at the time of śrāddha. Vide Brahmāndapurane (Upodghatapāda 11. 49). 

These requirements of learning, character and good conduct would naturally make it incumbent on the performer of a grāddha to inquire into the antecedents, qualities and defects of the brāhmanas to be invited, Manu and others lay down Beveral rules about the testing of the brahmapas to be invited. Manu III 149, Visnu Dh.874 S. 82.1-%. provide at an offering to the gods let a man not enquire into (the qualities of a brahmana (when he wants to invite), but at a grāddha offering to the Manes Olose inquiry (into qualities) is declared to bB proper and just.' Madu III, 130 says that even if a brahmana be master of the Veda, one should enquire far (into his ancestry). The Vayupurāna 675 appears to provide that inquiry into ( the qualifications of) brāhmands should not be always undertaken when gifts are to be made, but enquiry is declared (necessary) in the case of rites for gods and Manes. The Anusa sanaparya provides 876 that in rites meant for gods & ksatriya knowing the rules about gifts should not (closely) inquire into the qualifications of brāhmanas, but in rites for the gods and Manes such inquiry is quite proper. Vrddha-Madu and the Matsya-purāna877 lay down that a brāhmana's character is to be inquired into at the place where he resides for a long time, his purity by his acts and transactions with other people, his iptelli gonce by discussion with him; with these three one should inquire whether the brābmapa (to be invited) is a worthy person,

Inquiring into qualifications 

391 

IV 

The Nrsimhapurāna. 878 forbids close inquiry into the character and learning of one who comes by chance as a guest at the time of grāddba. That inquiry was allowed as to brāhmadas who were invited and not as to those who came by chance uninvited as anthis. There are no doubt certain passages particularly in the Puranas where scrutiny into & brāhmana's qualifications is condemned. For example, the Skandapurāna quoted by Apa rārka (p. 455) and Kalpataru ( on śr. p. 102) states The Vedic revelation is that śrāddha is to be offered (to & brāhman&) after inquiry (into his learning and character), but straightforward action is better than scrutiny. When one offers srāddha straightforwardly without inquiry his pitrs are gratified and also gods'. The Bhavisyapurāpa (q.. by Balanbbatti) states 'it is my view also that one should not test (the qualifications of) brāhmanas; one should only consider their caste and not their virtues'. Such passages are explained away as referring to a śrāddha at sacred places or as applicable to gifts or to atthis (vide Hemadri op sraddha p. 513, and Balambhatti on ācāra p. 494) 8784, 

Brahmanas vere declared to be apankteya 879 (not fit to sit in the row of brahmana diners or as defiling & row of diners at śrāddha) on various grounds, such as bodily and mental defects and diseases, purauit of certain avocations, moral lapseg, being guilty of crimas, being followers of unorthodox systems, being inhabitants of certain countries. A distinction has to be made batween brāhmanas who should not be invited and brahmapas that are apānkteya or panktidūsaka. For example, one should not ordinarily javite a friend or a sagotra brāhmana even

mapas at a śrāddha repast, Manu III. 170-182 indulge in pointing out how feeding such unworthy brāhmanas results in the logs of the gratification of pitrs and state that the food eaten by such unworthy persons becomes or is to be deemed as equal to foul things. The Kūrmapurāna 882 forbids inviting at śrāddhas Bauddha ascetics, Nirgranthas (devotees who have withdrawn from the world and wander about naked or as beggars), those that follow the Pancarātra and Pāśupata doctrines, those that are kāpālikas (devotees of Siya of the left hand order) and other similar heretical people. The Visnupurana (III. 18, 70 ff) narrates how a king after a bath in a holy place talked with a heretic and had to pass in consequence through the bodies of a dog, a jackal, wolf, vulture, a crow, a crane and peacock and ultimately became freed from the taint by a bath at the ava bhṛtha in an Aśvamedha sacrifice. The same Purana provides (ILL. 18 97 ) that one should avoid talking with or touching heretics, particularly at the time of a religious rite or when one has consecrated for a solemn sacrifice. The Vayupurāna 883 provides that people who are 'nagna' should not be allowed to see a śrāddha and then defines "nagna' people as follows: 'the three Vedas are declared to be a protective covering for all beings and therefore those who foolishly abandon the Vedas are called 'nagoa'; those who yainly keep matted hair, those who share their heads for no purpose, those who are nagna (naked) without any cause, those who engage in certain obser yances and mutter certain words aimlessly are called nag nādi'.

Hemādri(on érāāābs p. 505) quotes from the Saurapurāna the following: 'Brāhmanss hailing from the countries of Inga, Tanga, Kaliiga, Saurispring (Fathiapar), Gurjara, Abhira, Konkana, Dravida, Daśṣidāpatia, Aranti and Magadha should be groided at śrāddhas. It will be noticed that putting the above to passages together, brāhmapas from half of modern India mondd hare been ideligi ble for being invited at śrāddhas if these passages rare literalls followed. This pas probably a counsel of perfection prompted by the false pride and prejudices of the authors of those Torks. The Sraddharireka of Rudradhara (pp. 391) contains one of the longest lists of persons unfit to be joribed at a śrāddha 

The following reason is advanced by the Tarākapuring ** and others for honouring a guest Tho comes by chance at the time when a stāddha rite is in progress: "Iogins ander Ora the earth assuming different forms that present recognition, bat doing good to people; therefore a rise man should honour S guest who artires at the time of the performance of a śāddha". The Bharissa-pwāp3 similarly says that an asti (guest) at a śrāddha is one tho comes when least thought of and got one who had arrired before the śrādõha rife started. The Mārkanders ( 26, 30) provides that one should not ask such an alkthi about his gatra or carana or his Vedic stuar por should one consider whether he has a fine appearance.

Hemādri (Srāddhakānda, pp, 380-385 ) holds an intereste ing disoussion as to whether a performer of śrāddha belonging to one recension of a Veda must restrict himself to inviting brāhmanas that are students of the same recension of the Veda or whether he can invite any brāhmana that may bave studied any of the three Vedas. Some people relying on a maxim ('as in the case of a bride so in the case of an offering') invite only brahmanas of their own śākhā possessed of the qualifications above set forth. Hemādri replies tbat this is a wrong notion, relies on Ap. Dh, S. II. 6. 15. 9 'one should feed 887 in all (religious) acts brāhmapas that are pure (in their conduct) and that have studied the Veda' and asserts that no smrti, Itihasa, Purāda, Grhyasūtra nor Kalpasūtra contains the restriction of inviting only brāhmadas of the performer's own śākhā, He further says that in such texts as 'tripāciketas trimadhuh' (quoted in note 862a above) the rule laid down is to inpite brāhmavas that have studied different sakhās and Vedas. He rejects the idea about any restriction as to selecting a bridegroom of the same śākhā as the bride's father and remarks that if some people are not prepared to give their daughters in marriage to young men belonging to other śākhās, that is due to ignorance about the families and is also due to pride 'and vanity. He winds up by saying that in Aryāyarta countries it is found on all sides that marriage connections are entered into with persons studying different śākhās but living in the same district, (such connections) not being con demned, while persons who study the same śākhā of the Veda but do not know each other do not enter into marital connec tions.888 As a contrast to this commonsepse view it should be

noted that the author of the Balambhatti recommends that * Mahārāstra brāhmadas should not invite brāhmanas of other castes (of brāhmapas) and particularly the Konkapastha brāhmadas should be avoided and it goes so far as to say that a person belonging to one's own caste not possessed of good qualities and of a blemished character (provided he is not guilty of mabāpātakas or the like) should be preferred to one belonging to another sub-caste even if endowed with good qualities, 

The Vas Dh. S. provides 889 that the performer should invite ascetics, house-holders, well conducted men, who are not Tery old &c. The Kūrmapurāna states 890 ' that man whose offer

ing (of food) is eaten by a zati that knows the truth about - pralcrti (primordial matter) and the gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) reaps the reward (merit) of feeding a thousand (other brābmapas), Therefore one should feed in offerings to gods and manes an excellent yogin who is intent on true knowledge of God and others only if such a one is not available. Similar Verses about ascetics and yogins occur in Varāhapurāna 14, 50, Skanda (VI.217.7ff) and Vayupuranasi chap. 71.65-13, chap. 76.28 &c. Brhaspati provides 892 a special rule that, if a person cannot afford to feed at a śrāddba more than one brahmana, then he should feed one who has studied the Sāmaveda, since in him all the three viz. Rks, the Yajus and Samans co-exist, that the father is pljased by Rks (i. e, by the feeding of a brahmana who has studied the Rgveda), the grand-father by Yajus, the great-grand-father by a Sāman and a chandoga (a chanter of the whole of Samaveda) is superior. A Verse of Satatapa is 893 quoted to the effeot that if a student of the Atharyayeda is fed in a rite for the gods or manes, that yields endless and inex haustible rewards, 

Some of the smrtis were very strict in laying down the qualifications of brābmanas to be invited at a śrāddha, Ausa nasa (chap.4) asserts: 'that brahmana 894 is called durbrali mana and should never be invited at a śrāddha in whose family Veda study and Vedi (i. e. the performance of Srauta sacri fices) have been stopped for three generations'.

(Vol. author 895 further says that six persons are merely brahma bandhus (i, e. brāhmanas by birth or caste alone) viz, one who is hired by a śūdra or a king as a servant, who has a śūdra woman as his wife, who is a village priest and he who subsists by killing (animals) or by oatching them. So early as the Mahābhāsya 89 it was stated that austerities (leading a life of restraint and strict observances), Vedic learning and birth (from brābmapa parents) are the causes of (a man being called) a brāhmada and that he who is devoid of the first two is a mere brahmana by caste (but not a real brāhmapa). It is curious to note that Yama stated that, if brahmanas that do not declare (or point out) the auspicious naksatra or tathi or day or mu. harta and other auspicious matters, eat (sraddha) food it be comes inexhaustible. 

But the requisite qualifications were so exacting that it must have been found almost impossible to secure for a śrāddha brāhmabas altogether free from any of the blemishes set out above from Manu. Gautama (15 15-18) contains long lists 897 of over 50 kinds of brāhmadas that were not to be invited at a śrāddha dinner or at a sacrifice for gods, but Gaut, adds that according to some only those beginning with "durvāla' (Gaut, in 15.18) were to be shunned at a śrāddha (but could be invited at a sacrifioe for the gods). The persons so to be shunned, according to some who flourished before Gautama (i. e at least before 600 B O) are. a bald man, a man who has deformed nails or has black teeth (naturally), one suffering from white

Vas. quotes a verse 998 as follows: If a brāhmana knowing the Vedas is afflicted with physical defects which (ordinarily) exclude a person from a row of diners, Yama declares that he is irrepro achable and that he does sanctify the row of diners. But it must be said that even in modern times emphasis is laid on 

inviting learned and well-conducted brahmanas for śrāddha, The idea (expressed by Manu I, 189 and the Padmapurana) parsists that the prits enter into and hover round the invited brahmanas and that the latter are to be looked upon as represen ting the pitīs.899 The Garudapurāna states that Yama allows the departed souls and the pitrs to visit the world of men at the time of śrāddha from the nether regions. 

The Visnu Dh, S. (79. 19-21) prescribes that the perforiner should avoid wrath, should not shed tears and should not do things in a hurry. The Varāhapurāna 900 provides that the per former should not employ twigs for brushing the teeth (but should rinse his mouth twelve times with water), should remain chaste and pure, Ap. Dh, S prescribes 901 that the performer should not eat food from the commencement (from the time he goes out to invite) up to the end of the śrāddha rite. The

[Vol. 

Kūrma (uttarārdha 22. 8) states that if a person first invites a brahmana and then foolishly invites another (passing over the first) then he becomes a greater sinner (than the brāhmana who after accepting one invitation promises to dino at another śrāddha) and is born as a worm in human faeces. The Bhavisyapurāṇa 902 provides that honouring gods, pitrs and men and feeding (brāhmanas) should not be done without wearing an upper garment; otherwise the rite will bear no fruit. 

About the number of brāhmadas to bo invited at a śrāddha there were several options and several views. The Asy.Gr. S. states 903 that at the Pārvana--śrāddha (performed on a par van day i. e. on Amavasya), the Abhyudayika sraddha, the Ekod dista or Kūmya, the larger the number of brābmanas the greater is the reward, that in no case should & person invite only one brahmana at a śrāddha meant for all pitts or he may optionally invite only one brāhmana except at the first śrāddha, that he may invite one, two or three brāhmanas for each of the turee paternal ancestors, The San, Gr. (IV. 1,2)and Kausitaki Gr II, 14.1-% prescribe that one should 904 invite an uneven number of brālmapas, at least three, to sit down as (representing the) fathers. Gaut, requires 905 'He shall feed an uneven number

of brāhmanas, at least nine or as many as ho is able (to feed) and that they should be learned in the Veda and endowed with polished speech, good appearance, mature age and good character', If five were invited two would b3 for gods and three for pitrs; if seven, then four for gods and three for pitra and so on. Vas. XI, 27(= Manu II, 125 = Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 29), Yāj. 1. 228, Matsya 17. 13-14, Vispupurāda II 15.14 provide that one must feed two brahmanas at the rite for the gods and three for the manes or one only for each of the two purposes and even a rich man should not go in for a large company. The Padma purana (Srsti 9.98 and 141 ) says the same thing. So the number of brālımanas to be invited did not depand so much upon the means of the inviter, but upon the point whether the iugiter would be able to honour them all properly and with ease. The idea was that at the same time when śrāddha was to be performed two brābmanas should be fed for gods and three for the pitrs. When only one brāhmana could be invited or was available, Vas. (XI. 30-31) provides that portions of the several foods cooked should be put in a vessel and should ba placed at the place where Vaiśvadevika brāhmana would have been seated, then served in a plate and the viste devāh be invoked and should be contemplated as present and then the food should be thrown into the fire or offered to a Vedic student (as almas) and then śraddha rite should be continued, Saṅkha 906 14.10 provides a similar rule. The result is that if a man can afford to invite only one brāhmapa Or can secure one only, then that brāhmapa is meant for the rite in honour of pitrs and the offering for the gods is to be cast into fire. Baud. DI, S. II, 8.30, Manu III, 126, Vas. XI. 28, Kurma (uttarārdha 22 28) contain the same verse which emphatically states 'A. large company destroys these five desiderata, viz the respectful treatment (of those invited), the securing of a proper place (such as ona sloping to the south) and time, purity and (the

[Vol. choice of) ineritorioua brālmanas; thereforo one should not desire a large company 907 The Kūrorapurāpa (uttarardha 22.32 ) insists that an atithe must be fed at a śrāddha or other, wise the śrāddha is not praiseworthy. Though these ancient works insisted upon the avoidance of large preparations and expenses for śrāddhas in honour of a deceased person, there were other smrtis that favoured lavish distribution of wealth in śrāddhas. For exanıple, Brhaspati lays down: '( An heir ) should lay aside half of the wealth that comes to him (by inheritance ) for the benefit of the deceased owner and should expend it in the monthly, six-monthly and yearly śrāddhas'. The Dāyabhāga XI. 12 approves 908 of this and also quotes Ap, Dh. S. II. G. 13.3 'On the failure of a sapinda the teacher of the Veda takes the wealth of the deceased, on failure of the teacher, the pupil takes it and having inheri ted it he should employ it in the performance of works of charity for the benefit of the deceased' (or he himself may enjoy it). These passages show to what lengths the cult of benefit to the soul of the deceased was carried in India by certain writers. More practical authors such as Haradatts did not relish these extreme views. In severa) purādas such as the Vayu 9084 and Visou there are express directions that when a śrāddba is performed at Gayā, it should be on a profuse scale and no stinginess 909 (lit. cheating in money matters ) in spending wealth should be shown there; otherwise the performer would not reap the benefit of the performance of śrāddha at that holy place. The Padmapurāna appears to inculcate profuse

expenditure of wealth in all śrāddhas, The Vāyupurāna 910 (82, 26-28 ) further says that the brāhmapas of Gayā are super men, that when they are gratified (at a śrāddha) the gods together with pitrs become gratified, that no question should be raised about the family, the character, the learning and the austerities (of the Gayā brāhmadas), that by honouring them a man attains liberation, that a man after honouring the brābmanas should proceed according to his resources and strength to the performance of śrāddha, thereby he secures all heavenly desires and obtains the means of Moksa. The Skanda purāpa goes so far as to say that Gayā brābmanas even if they are depraved in their conduct and are backward deserve to be invited at sraddha and are superior to brāhmadas who have mastered the Veda and Vedāngas. The Nirnayasindhu (IIT. P. 401 ) notes that, according to the Tristhalisetu of his grandfather, this provision holds good only in the case of the śrāddha at the Aksayya Vata in Gayā and nowhere else. In modern times the brāhmanas at Gayā. used to require the performer of śrāddha while he was in the sacred Phalgu river to make a declaration about his wealth and demanded fees accordingly, thereby carrying to the letter the words of the Vāyupurāna, Many people returned from Gaya thoroughly dis illusioned and disgusted with the conduct of the brāhmanas at Gayā. In the Varāhapurāna 911 it is said that two yerses were sung by the pitrs viz Would such a blessed and intelli gant man be born in our family who will offer piodas (i. e. srāddha) to us without being stingy about wealth and who would bestow on brāhmanas with reference to us (i. e. for our benefit) jewels, clothes, land, costly vehicles and all other kinds of wealth including water, when he has riches enough? Here lavish expenditure on all śrāddhas (not only at Gayā. śrāddha) appears to be strongly recommended. Davala prc

itself. The Matsyapurāna 913 and Padma (Srsti-khanda 9.85-88) provide that the person intending to perform a śrāddha should in an humble manner invite the brābmanas on the previous day or (in the morning of) the day of śrāddha, that he should touch the right knee (of the brālmana to be invited) with the words 'you are given this invitation by me' and repeat in their hearing the following observance' you should be free from anger, should be intent on purity (of body and mind) and should abstain froni sexual intercourse and I, the performer of śrāddha, shall also act in the same way and that the pitrs in an aerial form wait upon the invited brāhmanas.' The Brhan-nāradiya-purapa states that the invitation should be in the words 'O best men You should do me a favour and accept the invitation for śrāddha. It is noteworthy that the Prajāpati-smrti (63) prescribes that one sliould invite brāhmanas for a śrāddha or sacrifice for gods in the evening of the previous day after uttering the verse 'akrodhanaiḥ &c.'914 The Skandapurāda VI. 217. 37 says that the performer should address the brāhmana as follows: 'my father (is or will enter) into this your body and so will my grand-father; let him (the grand-father) come with his father and you should strictly observe the vrata' (the rules ). The invitation to the brābmapas representing pitrs is to be given with the sacred thread in the prācīnāvīta form and to those for Vaiśvadevika in the yajiopavīta form, On the question whether the Vaiśvadeyika brāhmanas were to be invited first or the brāhmanas for pitig were to be invited first

[Vol, 

there is a conflict among smrtis and the medieval digests propose an option (vide Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1154-1157). Manu III. 205 appears to lay down that the daiva brāhmana should te invited first (daivādyantam tad-ıheta). Yama quoted by several digests 915 says that the performer should request in the evening of the previous day brāhmanas with the words 'You should all be free from exertions and should avoid passion and anger for the srāddha in my house which is to be performed tomorrow,' that the brābmadas should reply 'let it be so if the night passes happily and without any mishap to us.' The digests (e. g. Sraddhakriyakaumudi p. 81, Srāddhatattva p 194 and Nirdayasindhu III, p. 804) say that the verse 'saryāyāsa &c'may be repeated when the invitation is given on the day previous to the day of sraddha and the verse 'akrodhanaih' when the invitation is given on the morning of the grāddha day. The words of invitation differ according to different authorities, For example, according to the Mit. on Yāj I. 225 the words are "śrāddhe ksanah kriyatām.' Vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 algo. Manu TIT, 187 and 191 show that the words 'nimantrana' and 'amantrana' are used as synonyms. In the Sraddhasūtra 916 of Kātyāyana the word 'āmantrada'is used. But Pāpini 917 (NI, 3 161) apparently makes a difference between the meanings of the two words and the Mahābhāsya explains that invitation is called 'nimantrada' which if rejected (without proper cause) involves a fault or sin, while that invitation which one is free to reject (without incurring blame) is called 'āmantrana.' There fore, it must be held that the few writers such as Kātyāyana 

The who employ amantrana use it in a secondary sense. invitation should be given by a performer himself or by his son,

brother or a pupil or a brāhmaṇa, but it should not be given through a person of another varna 916 or a woman or a child or person belonging to another gotra por from a distance (Prajapati 64). Pracetas provides that a brāhmaṇa performer of śrāddha when giving an invitation should touch the right knee, a ksatriya inviter the left knee of the invitee, a Vaiśya inviter should hold both feet of the invitee and a sādra should prostrate himself at the feet of the invitee (vide Sx. Pr. p. 106 and S. K. L. p. 47). The Markandeya (28. 35) states an exception that if, when a sraddha rite is going on, brāhmagas or Vedic students or ascetics come by chance begging for food, the performer should make them pleased by falling at their feet and feed them (i, e, no formal invitation is necessary in these cases). Vide Visnupurana III. 15, 12 for feeding uninvited ascetics. It is provided by Bhrgu quoted by Henādri that the brāhmanas on accepting the invitation should pronounce the finely-worded and comprehensive Vedic benediction quoted below.19 

Uśanas 919a provides that the performer should wash the floor of his house with water, covdung it and cleange the vessels on the day previous to the sraddha and then give an invitation to the brāhmaṇas with the words 'tomorrow I am going to perform srāddha'. The Varahapurana and the Karma algo provide for this and for the washing of the clothes, Manu II. 206 also requires that the spot where śrāddha is to be performed should be clean, secluded, cowdunged and should clope to the south.

mana who bas been invited (to a śrāddha dinner) by a faultless performer should not refuse the invitation nor should lie, aftor being invited (and having acoepted the invitation), accept a gift of even (uncooked) food from another person. Manu III 190 and Kūrmapurāna provide that if a brahmada after recairing on invitation for a sacrifice to gods or manes according to sāgtra directions and after having accepted at violates the appoint ment, he incurs sin and becomes a hog 921 (in his next birth). This does not apply where he is unable to go on account of illness or other valid reason. 

The smrtis laid down some strict and elaborate rules which were to be observed by the brābmapas invited for śrāddha and by the performer himself. Many of the rules are applicable to both, Gaut prescribes 922 that the brahmana who has partaken of śrāddha dinner should remain chaste (1, e. shun sexual inter course) that whole day, and if he was intercourso with a wifo of the gūdra caste be thereby makes his own pilrs stay in tho ordure of that wife. Vas XI, 37 makes this rule applicablo both to the performer and the invited brāhmada and as regards wives of all varnas. Manu III. 188 prorides that the brālimana invited to dine at a sacrifice in honour of patrs and tho por former of the sraddha should remain controlled (1 o. chasto and free from anger and passion) and should not study the Veda (except jana). Yāj. I. 225 (latter lialt) briefly puts the matter by saying 'they should be controlled as to their bodios, speech and thoughts'. The Matssapurina prescribes thint both the performer of sriddha and the brahmana invited to dino at it should avoid dining again (after the śrūddha dinner), journey, going in a conveyanco, ovortions, scrual întorcourse, study of the Voda, quarrch and sleoping by day. Similar rules to observa continence are laid down for both on tho day of śrāddha if invitation be givon on the morning of tho dny of

I79 appears to strike a dissenting note about sexual intercourse with one's wife during the days from the 5th to the 16th; while most other medieval writers such as Hemadri (śr. pp. 1036-7) and Sr. P. p. 111 are opposed to this view, The Sraddhasūtra 924 of Kātyāyana provides that the performer should, from the time of giving invitation to the time when the brālmapas sip water (i. e, perform acamana after srāddba dinner), remain pure, free from anger, hurry, negligence, should speak the truth and should shun a journey, sexual intercourse, hard work and study of the Veda and control speech (should remain mostly silent) and the brābmapas invited should observe the same rules Auśanasa (Jiv, vol I pp. 526-527) contains verses very similar in import to Kātyāyana. The Brahmapurāpa (220. 106-108), Mārkandeya (28. 31-33) and Anuśāsana 125.24 have identical verses 925 and Vāyu 79. 60-61 are very similar in import, Laghu-Saṅkha 29, Laghu-Hārīta 75 and Likhita 60 have the same verse requiring the invited brāhmanas to avoid eight matters, viz. dining'again, journey, carrying loads, Vedic study, sexual intercourse, making gifts, accepting gifts, performing homa, while Prajāpati 92 substi tutes the brushing of the teeth (with a twig), tāmbūla, bath after applying oil to the body, and fast for the first four of the above eight The Anuśāsanaparva (90. 12-13) and Padma (Pātālakhanda 101, 94-95) also contain a list of actions that should be avoided Briefly put, the following were the obser vances for both inviter and invitee, vix avoidance of sexual intercourse, dining again, falsehood, hurry, vedic study, heavy work, gambling, carrying burdens, giving gifts and acceptance of gifts, theft, journey, sleep by day, quarrels; the performer alone was to abstain from eating tāmbūla, shaving, applying oil to the body, brushing the teeth with a twig; while the brāh

Manu III. 267 ( = Vāyu 83.3) is to the same effect as An. Dh, S. Yaj. 1. 258 is content to say that food which is fit to bo offorod in sacrifices (havidya) should be served, Manu III. 257 oxplains that food eaten by lormits in the forost, ( cow's ) Inills, soma juico, moat that is not prepared with spicos (or that is froo from a bad smell), rock salt aro by thoir vory naturo lavis (sacrificial food). According to Gaut. 27. 11 the sacrificial food (havis) comprises boiled rico, food obtainod by bogging, ground barley (after being bakod or fried), grain separated from husk, barley gruel, vege tablos, milk, curds, clarifiod butter, roots, fruits and water. 928 Other smrtis and digasts very much elaborated these brief indications in the early works. The three kinds of wealth (viz, suhla, tavala and krona ) and the several lawful or uncondemned moane of acquiring wealth have been described already in H, of Dhi. volIL PP 130 ff. The Mārkandeya (29. 14-15) copdemns the use in śrāddhas of wealth that is obtained by taking bribes or from a patita (one guilty of & grave sin), that springs from bride-price or that is declared to be unlawful or is obtained by saying to another 'give me for the sake of a sraddha to be offered to my father' (q. by Sin, O. on

The Skandapurāpa emphasizes that at a Sraddha purity (suddhi) must be specially secured in seven matters viz. the body (of the performer), the materials, the wife, the place (where śrāddha is to be performed), the mind, the mantras and brāhnanas, 929 Manu IL 235 (Vas. 11,35) states: three are the sanctifying things in a $rāddha, viz, a daughter's son, a Nepal blanket and gesamum greins and three are commended in śrāddha viz, cleanliness, freedom from anger and absence of burry.929 Pracetas mentions several kinds of porn that are commended as food in srāddha. Manu III, 255 summarises that in śrāddha the riches (i. e. the most im portant matters) are afternoon, darbhas, proper cleansing of the place (or house) for grāddha, sesame, generous expense (on food &c.), solsoning food, eminent brāhmanas. 

The Mārkandeya-purāda says that several kinds of corn yielding plants (some due to tillage in villages and some growing wild) wore produced by Brahmā when he milked the earth for famished people, while Brahmavaivarta (q. by Hemādri on grāddha p. 537 ) affirms that when a few particles fell down on the earth while Indra drank Soma, from them aroge such corn as śyāmāka, wheat, yava, mudga and red paddy and as they were produced from soma they were like nectar to the pitrs and food prepared from these should be offered to pitrs. The Mārkandeya speaks of seven kinds of grāmya corn and seven kinds of wild (aranya) corn. Prajāpati 119 recommends the use of eight kinds of corn, viz. nīvāra, māsa, mudga, wheat, paddy, yava, grain and sesamum. The Matsya (g by Hemādri op śrāddha p. 538) narrates that when the Sun drank nectar some drops fell down from which arose the several kinds of

The Sat-tramsa mnata 931 forbids the use in śrāddha of all kinds of cereals covered with dark busk except sesamum, mudga and māsa.

What milk and water to be used 

415 

From considerations of space this matter cannot be pursued further. The Mit, on Yaj. I 240 puts together a long list of allowed and of condemned kinds of grains and other articles, 

What milk should be ordinarily partaken of and what sliould be avoided has been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II pp. 782-783. A few words are added here. Manu III, 271 and Yāj.I. 258 provide that if cow's milk or rice cooked therein (called payasa) is offered in śrāddha the pitrs are satisfied for one year. Vāyu 78.17, Brahma 935 220 169, Mārkandeya 32 17-19, Vispupurāna III.16.11 forbid the use in a śrāddha of the milk of a she-buffalo, of a camari or female deer, of sheep or eves, of she camels, of human females and of all animals with one hoof and the use of the curds and clarified butter prepared from such milk. But ghee prepared from buffalo milk was allowed by Subantu and Devala (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 572 ). 

The Mārkandeyapurana 936 (29.15-17), Vayu (78.16) and Visoupurana (I 16 10) lay down that the water to be employed in sraddha must not have a bad smell, must not be foamy, or taken from a puddle or a small reservoir which cannot slake the thirst of a cow, must not have been brought oveinight, must not be taken from a reservoir not dedicated to all or from a trough or the like meant for beasts. 

Several rules are laid down about the fruits, roots and vegetables recommended or condemned for use in sraddha, For example, the Brahma-purāpa (220.156-158 ) enumerates several kinds of fruits such as mangoes, bilza, pomegranate, cocoanut, dates, grapes, as fit to be given in śrāddba. Vide Saṅkha 14 22-23 also. Tayu (78 11-15 ) states 936r that garlic, leeks and onions, other things that are of bad odour or taste

and all erudation from trees not permitted by the Veda and sa gathered from saltish earth, should be avoided jo śrāddha. Th Vispudharmasūtra 93 (79.17) contains a long list of fruits bulbs and vegetables that were not to be employed in śrāddha. The Rāmāyāda states 938 that Rāma when an exile in the Dandake forest gratified his pitrs by offering the fruits of inguda, badara, and bilva trees and generalises that deities are offered that food which is partaken of by a person (who is a devotes of That deity). From considerations of space detailed references to the smrtis and purānas are passed over. The Smrtyarthasara pp. 52-53, Srāddhavireka (pp. 43–47) of Rudradhara and other digests collect in one place the foods, vegetables, fruits and roots that are allowed to be offered in śrāddha and that are condemned in graddba. Manufactured salt was forbidden, but natural salt from a lake (called saindhava) was allowed, Salt was not to be served directly (as Visnudharmasūtra 79. 12 says) but when put in while cooking Fegetables it was not prohibited. There was a difference of opinion about the employment of asafoetida (vide Hemādri on Srāddha p. 565). The Viṣpadharmasātra (79.5-6) provides that flowera baving a strong (or nasty) odour or no odour at all, the blossoms of thordy plants and red flowers should not be given, but one may give white and sweet-smell ing flowers even though they are taken from thorny plants and flowers though red in colour may be taken from aquatic plants, Saṅkha (14, 15-16) is to the same effect (q. by Hem dri p 684). Vāyu (75. 33-35) is to the same effect and adds that the flowers called Japā, Bhandi, Rūpikā (of arka plant), Kurantaka should be avoided in śrāddha. The Brahmapurāda (220, 162 165 ) specifies the several kinds of flowers that may be offered in śrāddha such as jāti, campaka, mallika, mango blossom, tulasi, tagara, ketaki and various kinds of lotuses (white, blue and red &c.). The Smrtyarthasāra includes tulasī among things to be avoided in śrāddha. The Sm. C. notes this and remarks

Kuśas are required in srāddha, Vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 657 for general remarks on kuśas. A few words may be added here. The Sat. Br. VII. 2. 3. Astates that the watera that, loathed Vrtra went out to waterless deserts and becomo bushes of darbhas 939. Similarly, Asv. Gr. III. 2.2 Bummarizes a Brah mapa text stating that darbhas are the essence of waters and herbs (apām pā ega ogadhinim raso yad-darbhāh), Prajapati (verse 98) 939m provides that darbhas should be gathered iron a pura spot in the morning by a brahmana, should have mantrag rapeated over them, should be greenish in colour, should be as long as a coy's ear and then they are loly. The Gobhila gr. (1.5.16-17) states 'the barhis consists of kusa grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main strik and that the blades should be cut off near the roots at the ritos meant for the Fathers'. Daksa (IL. 33 and 35) provides that the second part of the day (divided into eight parts) is the proper time for collecting fuelsticks, flowers and kuśas. The Gobhilasınrti 1120-21) says that the darbhas used in sacrifices are green nish, those to be used in Pakayajñas should be yellowish, thoso jo rites for the pitis must be taken out from the roots and thoso that are to be used in Vaiśvadeva should be dark-pale, and that

greenish darbhas together with ends uncut, that are smooth and well nourished, one aratni in length and touched with that part of the hand called pitrtirtha are pure. The Padmapurana (Srstikhanda 11.92 ) and Skanda VII.1. 205.16 state that kuśas and black sesamum spring from the body of Visnu and the Vispudharmottara I, 139.12 says that tılas and darbhas sprang from the perspiration and hair of Visou in the Boar incarna tion, The Matsya (22.89 ) says the same. 

The Garuda 941 (Pretakhanda 2,21-22) states that all the three gods dwell in kuśa grags viz, Brahmā at its root, Visnu in the middle and Saṅkara at the end and that brāhmadas, mantras, kuśas, fire, tnlasf leaf--these do not become nirmālya (stale and so unfit to be used again ) even when the same are employed again and again. But an exception is made by Gobhila 912 that those darbhaś which are spread on the ground for placing pindas on them or that are used in tarpana and those that are held in the hand while a man is answering the calls of nature should be given up (and not used again). The Visnu Dh. S. 79.2 and Vāyu 75,41 provide that if kuśas are not avail able, kāśa grass or Dryā may be substituted. The Skanda: purāpa VII (Prabhasakhanda ) part 1.206.17 says that straight darbhas are used in giving gifts, at baths, in japa, homa, dinner and worship of gods, but they are double-folded when used in rites for pitṛs. The Skanda VIT, 1 205.16 provides that the top of darbhas is for divine rites, while darbha with the root and tip 13 meant for partrla rites. This is based on the Sat. Br II 4. 2.17 which states that the top of the darbha belongs to gods, the middle to men and the root part to the fathers, 

Great importance was attached to the use of trla (sesamum) in śrāddha. The Jaiminigrhya II,1 states that the whole house should have sesamum grains scattered about in it. Baud Dk. S II. 88 provides that when the invited brāhmadas come they should be given water mixed with sesame, The Baud, gr. I. 11.64 provides that sesamum grains are holy in śrāddha for making gifts of them or as part of food or for being mixed in

water. The Prajapatismrti speaks 943 of four kinds of tilas viz. white, black, very black and jartilas and states that each succeeding one gives greater gratification to the pitrs than each preceding one. The Tai, S. V. 4.3.2 refers to jartilas and Jai. X. 8.7 holds a discussion thereon. The Nāradapurāna (pārvārdha 28 36) 944 provides that the performer of śrāddha should scatter tılas in the midst of the brāhmanas invited and at the doors with the mantra 'apahatā' (may tho asuras and evil spirits that sit on the altar be struok and run away). Yaj. I. 234 also recommends this mantra (which is Vāj. S. II. 29). The Kūrma purāna (II. 22. 18 ) states that sesame should be scattered all round and a goat should be tied near the spot, since śrāddha polluted by asuras becomes purified by sesame and a goat. The Vispupurāpa (III. 16.14 ) prescribes that by tilas scattered on the ground one should ward off evil spirits (Yātudhāna ). The Garudapurāna 945 (Pretakbapda 2. 16 ) makes Srikrsna say 'tilas have sprung from the 'perspiration on my body and are holy; asuras, dūnavas and daityas run away on account of tilas.' The Anuśāsana-parva (90.22 ) says that yātudhānas and goblins snatch away the laurs when the śrāddha is offered without tilas. The Krtyaratnākara (p. 540 ) quotes a verse as follows: 'he who applies as unguent tilas, who bathes with water in which tilas are mixed, offers trlas into fire, makes gifts of trlas, oats tilas and who grows tilas-these six never sink (i, e, are not unlucky nor in trouble ). 

A great deal is said about the vessels to be used in offering aighya (water for honouring the invited brāhmanas and pipdas), for cooking śrāddha food, for dining and for serving. The Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana 946 provides that the arghya water

should be taken in camasaB (cups) made of sacrificial trees (such as palāśa, aśyattha, udumbara ) or in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn, precious stones whichever may be available, or in a vessel made of leaves, The Visnu Dh, S. (79. 14-15) provides that the performer should employ metallic vessels, particulariy vessels made of silver, The Mārkandeya (31.65) and Vāyu (74.3) state that in & vessel of silver the (ancient) pitrs milked sudha and hence & silver vessel is highly desired by pitrs and brings de light to them. Yaj. I 237 also specially recommends silver Vessels. The Vayu (74. 1-2), Matsya (17. 19-22), Brahmanda (Upodghāta 11. 1-2) and Padma (Srstikhanda 9. 147-150) state that vessels of gold, silver or copper are the (propor) 0293 for pitrs; that even the talk about silver or the sight or gift of silver gives inexhaustible results to pitrs in heaven, that vessels to be used for arghya, for pioda and for the food to be offered should be preferably of silver and that in rites for gods a silver Vesso) is not auspicious. Atri (g by Sm. C. II, p. 464) says that in rites for the gods and pitrs, vessels of gold and silver should be respectively employed and in default of those vessels of other metals (such as copper, bell-metal) should be used (as stated by Visou Dh, S. 79,22 and 24). The Padma provides 957 that the vessels may be of sacrificial wood or of palasa or of silver or made from a sea product (such as conch shell) and that since silver was produced from the eye of Siva, it is a great favourite with pitrs. Prajāpati (111) provides that the three pindas should be cast in a vessel of gold or silver or copper or bell matal or of rhinoceros horn but not in earthenware or a wooden Vessel, that (verse 112) the cooking vessels should be of copper or of any metal, but an earthen vessel baked in fire and immersed in water is the best (for cooking), that food cooked in an iron vessel is like crow's flesh, that (115) the vessels to be used for taking food by the brāhmanas should be made of gold, silver or of an alloy of five metale or they may take their food in patrāvalı (i. e, leaves stitched together); vide also Matsya

Vessels to be used at śrāddha 

421 

17. 19-20. The use of plantain leaves for bhojana is forbidden9470 by some. Brāhmanas should not take acamana from a vessel made of bell-metal, kharpara, śukra, stone, clay, wood, fruit or iron. Acamana should be performed with water from a copper vessel. Atri (153) proscribes that no food should be served from an iron vessel; if so served the food is like ordure to the diner and the server goes to hell. The vessels for cook iog śrāddha food are to be made of gold, silver, copper or bell metal or even of clay provided the last are new ones and strong (well baked) but never of iron. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 155 for details. The Vigpu Dh S. (79, 24) quotes a verse which says that food offered in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or of phalgu wood becomes inexhaustible. 

Vispu Dh. S 79. 11 provides that for unguents ( anulepana) to be applied to the bodies of the invited brāhmanas, sandal vood, saffron, camphor, aguru, padmala may be used. The Brahmapurāna (220. 165–166) mentions kustha, jaṭā-mansi, nutmeg, uśira, mustā and some others as proper perfumed articles to be used at śrāddhas, 

It has already been seen at pp.413-14 what kinds of food were recommended or condemned for śrāddha. The Matsyapurāpa 948 states that food containing milk and curds and clarified butter from cow's milk mixed with sugar gives satisfaction to all pitrs for one month and that whatever food, whether cow's milk or ghee or rice cooked in milk, is mixed with honey, yields jnexbaustible results. The Brahmapurāpa also (220. 182-184) provides that such eatables as are sweet and oily and are slightly sour and pungent should be served in śrāddha and one should slun eatables that are very sour or very saltish or very puogent, since they are usu'a (fit for asuras). Great emphasis was laid on serving preparations of food made from māsa

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. beans. The Auśanasa 749--smrti pronounces the threat that the brāhmana, who, when dining at śrāddha, does not sat māsa food, becomes a boast for twenty-one births after death. The Sm. O. quotes a smrti text saying that a śrāddha in which no māsa preparation is offered is as good as not performed. 

The greatest divergence has prevailed about the employ ment of Desh at śrāddbas among writers from the earliest times. The subject of flesh-eating in general has been discussed at great length in the History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. II pp 772-782. A few remarks about flesh in relation to śrāddla will not be out of place here. The Āp. Dh. S. prescribes 950 that the obli gatory śrāddha (to be performed every month) must contain food mixed with fat, the best course (for supplying fat) is to employ clarified butter and flesh; on failure of these two, sesa muin oil and vegetables may be employed. The same sutra a]so provides 951 that the pitrs are gratified for a year by the offering of cow's flesh in a śrāddha, that by the flesh of a buffalo the gratification of pitrs extends to more than a year, that this rule extends to the flesh of wild animals (like hares) and village (or domesticated) animals (like goats) that are declared to be fit for being sacrificed, that the gratification of pitrs extends to endless time of the flesh of a rhinoceros is offered to brahmanas seated on rhinoceros skin, so also by the flesh of the

fish called 'satabali' and the flesh of a Varddha inasa. Vas. XI. 34 contains the following remarkable verse: 'an ascetic, when invited in a rite for the gods or pitrs, who avoids (does not partake of) flesh, dwells in Hell for as many years as the number of hair (on the body of the animal whose flesh he avoids).' Even the Vishudharmottarapurāpa (1. 140. 49-50) emphatically asserts that he who does not partake of flesh-food in a row of diners at a frāddha which has been properly em ployed goes to hell Manu V, 35 and Kūrma I. 17.40 contain a similar verse applicable to all those who are invited as brāh manas at a śrāddha The Kūrınapurāna II, 22.75 provides that the brāhmana who is employed for the performance of a sraddha and does not eat flesh offered therein becomes a beast for 21 births, Manu III 257 states that the following are said to be proper offerings in a śrāddha by their very nature yiz. food (prepared from nīvāra grain and the like) fit for a forest hermit, milk, soma juice, flesh that does not emit foul smell and unmanufactured salt. An ascetic was ordinarly required not to partake of flesh; but Vasistha insisted on his partaking of it when invited at a śrāddha.

honey, of food fit for hermits (wild corn such as nivūra), the flesh of a red goat, of Mahāśāka (i e. Kālaśāka), and the flesh of Vārdhrinasa--these secure inexhaustible fruit There is some divergence of views among the several works. For example, Madu II. 267 and 271, Katyāyana (in śrāddhasūtra 7 ) appear to hold that by offering food prepared from village corn (such as rice, māsa &a) or wild eatables (such as nitūra or fruits and roots) the gratification is only for one month and the flesh of Vārdhripasa produces gratification for twelve years only (and not for all time ). - Visdu Dh, S. 80.10 and Manu III. 270 bring in buffalo flesh and tortoise flesh as giving gratification for ten and eleven month respec tively. Hemādri (on srāddha p 590 ) 953 is careful to point out that these words about the duration of time are not to be taken literally but what is really intended is to convey greater and greater gratification of the pitrs according to the kind of flesh offered. Pulastya quoted by the Mit and Apararka p. 555 provides that a brāhmana should generally or mainly offer at a śrāddha hermit's food, a ksatriya or a vasya should offer flesh, a śūdra should offer honey and all vardas may offer anything else (except these three) which is not forbidden. 954 Whoever may be the offerer, the eater at a śrāddha dinner was to be a brāhmada alone and so it follows that brāhmadas invited to a sraddha by a ksatriya or vaiśya had to eat flesh. Yet it is remarkable that even the Mitaksara and the Kalpataru written about 1100-1120 A. D. do not expressly say that in the Kali age flesh-eating at śrāddha is totally prohibited at least for brahmapas. It bas been shown already (H, of Dh. yol II pp. 775-776) that even when animal sacrifices were the order of the day in the Rgveda and the Brāhmadas there was an undercurrent of thought that the offerings of fuel-sticks or of boiled rice when made with heart felt devotion to the gods were as good as flesh offerings for

securing their favour. In course of time that conception grew str. onger and stronger, so much so that Manu (V.27-44 and V.46-47) and Vasistha appear to be in two minds (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 778-780). Gradually the offering of flesh in Madhuparka and in śrāddhas came to be totally condemned in works of the 12th and 13th centuries and onwards as a matter prohibited in the Kali age (Varātithipitrbhyaśca pasūpākaranakriya ). (Vide H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 945-946 and p. 964). Now except among the brāhmanas (in Northern India ) who have no objection to include fish in diet as permissible to them no brāhmana offers flesh in sraddha, The usage of Northern India would be in accordance with the view set out in Brhannāradīya purāna that one should offer honey, flesh and other things according to the usage of the country, as explained by the Prthyicandrodaya. 

Manu (V.11-18) contains long lists of animals, birds and fishes whose flesh was not to be eaten oven by those who were flesh-eaters, 

If a person is destitute, some of the Purāpas such as the Vispu (III. 4.24-30) and the Varaha (19,53-58) mercifully provide in identical 955 verses that instead of entertaining brābmanas with a sumptuous dinner or flesh the poor man may offer only un cooked corn, or some vegetables growing wildly or some slight daksinā if he cannot offer even uncooked food or vegetables, or he may offer a few grains of sesamum (7 or 8) to a brāhmana with water in his folded hands, or grass to a cow enough for one day and if he cannot afford even any one of these, tben he may repair to a thicket of trees, raise his arms so that bis armpits are exposed and loudly address the guardians of the worlds such as the Sun in the following words: 'I have neither wealth zor money nor anything else it to be offered by way of śrāddha; I bow to my pitrs; may the pitrs be satisfied by my devotion; I have stretched these arms in spacel' (lit, the path of the wind).

It is not time to describe the procedare of the Pārvada śrāddha St Thich is the pattern or norm (prakti) of the other Sraddhass (eren including the Astakas). Here one meets with great divergences of views eren from the times of the sūtras up to modern times. Though the main items and stages in the rite of śrāddha ara generally the same, there is variation jo the mantras, the details and sometimes in the order of the sereral items, Kātrāgada lays dossa that erery man has to folloss his own sūfra as to the use of the word 'srāha' or the Fords 'sradhā namah', as to earing the sacred thread in the Fajāoparita or prācīnārīta var and as to the number oi anuls 957

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. He says 'to Soma drunk by the pitrs, sradhal Adoration!' He says 'to Agni, the carrier of kavja, svadhāl Adoration ! (Thereby) he pleases the fire that pertains to the pitrs. He offers (into fire) three oblations; he puts down (on the darbhas spread on the ground) three pindas. (These) thus come to six in number. Six indeed are the seasons. He (thereby) pleaseg the seasons The seasons are indeed the shining (or divide) pitrs......The darbha grass is cut with one stroke; the pitrs have as it were (passed away) once for ever. He puts down thrice (the pindas) The pitṛs are indeed in the third world from here. He (thereby) pleases them. He (the performer) turns his face away (to the north from the south), for the Fathers are shy, He remains with his face turned away till the steam (of the boiled rice of the pindas) ceases to rise, for the Fathers have the steam of rice as their share; he should simply emell (the pipdas). That as if does not amount to eating of non-eating. The pitṛs when departing (from the śrāddha rite) take away or grant a valiant son. He cuts off the fringe (of a garment to place it on the pindas), for the share of Fathers is taking away (what is offered). He (thereby) allots their proper share to the pitrs (and dismisses them). When the performer) is in the latter part of life (i e, over 50 years of age) he cuts off hair (from his chest instead of presenting a dasa) At that time he is nearer to the pitrs (when above 50 years of age). He offers adoration, because adoration (namaskāra) is dear to the pitrs, Adoration to you, O Fathers, for vigour; adoration to you, o fathers, for life, adoration to you, O fathers, for sadha, adoration to you, O fathers, for ardour; adoration, O fathers, for the terri ble! O fathers' here is adoration to you. This (pindapitryazña) is indeed a sacrifice of men (i e. sacrifice to departed men) and other sacrifices belong to the gods" In the Tai Br. 1 4 10 the Pitryajña performed in sākame tha is praised (in 2) and further on it is said that Rtus (seasons) are pitrs and they offered pitryajia to Prajāpati, their father. This passage supports the provision made in Manu and some of the digests that the Rtus are to be identified with pitrs and obeisance is to be made to them.%0

Pindapit ryajsia in sat. Br. 

429 

The Sat. Br. (II. 4. 2) contains the following somewhat fuller account of the Pjoda-pitryajña, omitting legendary or other irrelevant matters -When the moon is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (the performer of the Darsa sacrifice presents food to the Fathers in each month ...... He Presents it in the afternoon, The forenoon indeed belongs to the gods; the midday to mon; and the afternoon to the Fathers; therefore le presents (food to the Fathers ) in the afternoon, While seated behind the Gārhapatya fire with his face turned towards the south and the sacred thread on his right shoulder be takes that material (for the offering from the cart). There upon he rises from thence and threshes the rice while standing north of the Daksina fire and facing the south. Only once does he clean the rice, for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away. He then boils it. While it stands on (the Daksina fire) he pours some clarified butter on it. After remov ing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two oblations in the fire ...... Here he is engaged in a sacrifice to the Fathers; hence he thereby propitiatos the gods and being permitted by the gods, he presents that food to the Fathers. He offers to both Agni and Soma ,, He offers with the formula "To Agni, the carrier of kavija (what is offered to the Manes), svāhal', 'To Soma accompanied by the Fathers, svāhal' (Vā; S. 29). He then puts the pot-ladle (meksapa) on the fire, that being in lieu of the Svistakrt. Thereafter he draws (with the spliya, the wooden sword) one line south of the Daksina fire, that being in lieu of the altar. He then lays down a firebrand at the further (south) end of the line. For, were he to present that food to the Fathers without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Raksasas vould certainly tamper with it. ... He lays it down with the text whatsoever Asuras roam about being attracted by the svadha (offering to Fathers), assuming various shapes, be they large-bodied or small-bodied, may Agni expel them from this world (Vaj s. II 30)... He then takes the water jar and makes the Fathers wash (their hands) merely saying 'N, N., wash thyself' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N. N. wash thy self (naming the sacrificer's) grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself

(naming) the sacrificer's great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case, Now those (stalls of sacrificial grass) are sovered with one stroke and cut off near the root; the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men and the root part (of darbhas) to the fathers. Therefore they are cut off near the roots ...... Ho spreads them along with the line with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents (to tlo fathers the three round cakes of rice). He presents thus for the gods they offer thus for men they ladja out; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way; therefore he presents the cakes to the fathers) thus With 'N. N., this for theel' he presents one cake to the sacrificer's father. Some add 'for those that come after thee', but let him not say this, since he himself is'one of those to whom it would be offered in comcuon. Let him therefore merely say 'N, N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's father; "N. N., this for thes' as to his grandfather; 'N N., this for thee' as to his great grandfather He then mutters 'Here, O fathers, rogale your selves; like bu]ls come hither each to his own share!' (Vaj. S. II, 31). Whereby he says 'Eat each his own share'. He then tuins round to the left so as to face the opposite (north) side; for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers), 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail' say some; 'for thus far extends the vital energy'. However, having remained so far a moment-he again turns round (to the right) and mutters "the Fathers have regaled themselves; like bulls they have come each to his own share' (Vāj. S. II. 31); whereby what he says is 'they have eaten each his own share. Thereupon he takes the water jar and makes them wash themselves by pouring water on the pindas), merely saying 'N. N., wash thyself (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N. N. wash thyself' (naming) his grandfather; 'N, N., wash thyself' (naming) his paterna) great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest). When he has taken his meal, so it is here. He then pulls down the tuck (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuok is sacred to the Fathers; therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. ... Six times he performs obeisance, for there are six seasons and the fathers are the seasons, He mutters 'Give us houses, O fathers, for the fathers are the rulers of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this saorifioial performance, After the

monthly śrāddha (masi-śrāddba) is the prakrti of Astakā and other grāddbas in which three ancestors are to be invoked. It is as follows. Now then at a Pārvana-śrāddha, or at a śrāddha celebrated for securing some desired object, or at an Abhyu dayika-śrāddha or at an Ekoddistaśrāddha, the performer causes to sit down brahmanas who are endowed with learning, nioral character and proper conduct or who are endowed with (at least) one (of these three characteristics), who have been invited already in proper time, who have taken a bath, whose feet are washed (by the performer) and who have sipped water (taken ācamana), as representatives of (or equal to) the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each of the Fathers, or two for each or three for each. The larger the number of brāhmanas invited the greater is the fruit or reward. But in no case (should he invite ) only one for all (the Fathars), or he may invite only one brahmana except at the first śrāddha 967. By the exposition of the Pindapitryajāa the rules for the pārvapa-śrāddha have been declared. Having given water (into the hands of the invited brāhmana or brāhmanas after they sit down) and double-folded darbha blades as a seat (on which the darbhas are to be kept), having again given water to them and having poured water into three vessels of metal (silver &c.), of stone and of earthenware or into three Vessels made of the same substance (out of these three) which are covered over with darbha blades and having recited (over the water in the vessels) the verse 'śanno &c.'

IV 72) that Asyalāyana treats of only the procedure relating to the rite for pitrs and that he does sot at all refer to the digger given to darda or Vaiśvadeva brāhmanas at the time of srāddba It is therefore possible that feeding daiva brāhmanas was added to the anciegt ritual, though it must be said that Madu III. 125, Yaj. I. 224-28 and Vas XI, 27 prescribe such feeding. Dr. Caland (10' Abaeocult' p 161 ) asserts that he can prove that the detail of feeding daiva brāhmanes spread from the Sradd basūtra of Kātyāyana to the other sutras and he relies on the fact that Kātyāyana (18 Kandikā 2) prescribes that the yıśve devāb sbould be lovoked with the verse Viśve devāsa āgata' and the performer should mutter the verse viśve devāh śrontemam' which are respectively Vāj S. VII, 34 and XXXIII 53. But Dr. Caland tries to prove too much. The first verse occurs twice in the Rg. (II 41, 13 and VI 52 7) and the second occors 10 Rg. VI, 52 13, Tai S II 4 14 5, They are not found only in the Vaj. S as Dr. Caland seems to bave thougbt It is possible that other works took over those waatras from the Rgveda or the Tai S It may also be Boted that Yaj, I, 229 mentioøs only 'Viśve devāsa' and specifies that it is a rk (and not a mantra or yayas). So Yāj, at least does not appear to have borrowed the prescriptions of Katyāyana. It is not necessary to examine the other arguments.

When he sees that the brāhmapas are satiated (with the food served at the dinner) he (the performer) should recite to the brahmanas the verses containing the word 'madhu' (Rg.

(they should reply that it was) and then having taken (portions of) the different foods that were enjoyed by the brāhmanas together with the sthālīpāka food in order 978 to make lumps (pindas) thereof he should present all (the rest of the food) to the brāhmanas. After the brāhmanas have either accepted (the rest of the food) or given hin permission (to use it for his family and friends), and after they have finished eating he should, before they have sipped water (performed acamana after finishing their dinner), put down the lumps 979 (pindas) for the Fathers. According to soms teachers (piṇdas are put down) after the brābmapas have sipped water (on getting up from the dinner).

From considerations of space it is impossible to set out all the differences among the several grhyasūtras of the Rgveda, of the Taittiriya Sakhā (viz. Bauāhāyana, Āp, Hir., Bharadvāja and Vaikhānasa), of the Vajasaneya sakha (such as Sraddhasūtra of Katyāyana), of the Samaveda (such as Gobhila and Khādira) and of the Atharyaveda (being Kauśika sūtra) A few matters may be set out by way of illustration. The Ap. gr. (21. 3-4)981 states that (after the brābmapas are invited for śrāddha dinner) from the food prepared for the dinner a portion is taken out in a vessel and therefrom seven alutis are cast into the fire with the goven mantras beginping with 'yan me mātā' (in Āp. M. P. II. 19, 1-7), the first two for the father, the next two for the grand-father, next two for the great-grand-father and the 7th to pitrs in genera] with svāhā (but without naming any one) and then six oblations of clarified butter are offered with the six formulas beginning with 'svāhā pitre' (Ap. M. P. I. 19 8-13). Thus the agnaukaraba in Āp consists of two parts viz, āhutis of food and of clarified butter, while in Aśv it is made only with food. Then the performer should touch all food (cooked food and the remainder of what is employed for offering into fire ) with the three mantras esa te tata madhumān' (Ap M. P. II. 19.14-16), he should make the brāhmadas touch the food served to each with the Yagus formula 'the earth is thy vessel' (Ap. M.P. 2. 20.1) quoted in n. 992 below, 

Ap. gr. prescribes the mantra, 'putran pautrān' (Ap. M, P, IL 20, 24) for moistening the pindas, while Baud. gr. and Vaikhānasa gr. (IV.6) employ the mantra 'ūrjam yahantir' (Vāj. S. II. 34) for the same purpose. It may be noted that 

980 a. It will be noticed that Aśv. omits several details viz.

these gūtras which belong to the Taittirlya sakha employ a verse from another recension vit, the Sukla Yajurveda 

The Hir. Gr. (II. 10-13) is more elaborate than the Ap. Gṛ. and not only sets out at length many of the mantras in Āp. M. P. II. 19-20, but adds some more. The Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyada (1-3) sets out the procedure of the monthly sraddha almost in the same way as the Yājñavalkyasmrti (which is set out below). It states that in the monthly śrāddha first come the daiva rites and then the various items ocour as in the Pinda-pitryajña 'pindapitryajña-vad-upacārah' (first sūtra of the 2nd kandikā) some details which it contains (and Yāj. does not expressly mention) may be set out here. It gives in full the mantras 'tilosi', 'yā divya' (both of which occur in Asy, gr.), 'prthivi to patram' (which is Āp. M. P. II. 20.1). It prescribes that in addition to the Gayatri and the Madhumati Verses the word 'madhu' should be repeated thrice. The holy texts to be repeated while the brāhmanas are engaged in eating according to Kātyāyana are the Gāyatrī (once or thrice), the five Rāksoghni verses (Rg. IV. 4. 1-5, Vāj. S. XIII, 9-13, Tai, S. I 2. 14, 1-2), Purusasūkta, the Apratiratha hymn (Rg. X. 103, 1-13 = Vā), S. 17. 33-34, 46 = Tai, S. IV. 6.4 1--4) and others, Tt expressly states that the svadhāvācana (Yāj. I 244) relates to both paternal and maternal ancestors. Besides the blessing contained in Yāj I 246, Kātyāyana provides that the performer is to pray for and the brabmanas are to pronounce two more viz, 'May the pitȚs be kind (lit not dreadful) to us' and 'May our family prosper'. Dr Caland in his learned work 'Altindi scher Ahnencult' (pp. 150-152) appears inclined to hold that when a sūtrakāra has not actually said anything on certain iteins in the śrāddha ritual, one has no right to anticipate, on the authority of later authors, that those items existed in the times of that sūtrakāra, I demur to this conclusion, Dr. Caland has attached no weight to the fact that Jaimini (as stated in H. of Dh, vol III p 870) laid down the principle that one may include certain items from another śākhā. Jaimini's sūtras cannot be supposed to have laid down those propositions for the first time. Jaimini's sūtras are at least as old as some of the extant srauta sūtras such as that of Kātyāyana Therefore hardly any chrono logical conclusions can be drawn with certainty from the silence of a sūtrakāra as to a certain item in the śrāddha ritual. 

We shall now turn to the metrical smrtis. Manu treats of the procedure of śrāddha at some length in III. 208–265, But

The brahmanas invited should be even in number (2, 4 &c.) according to the performer's re sources at the darva rite (i. e, the Vaiśvadavika brāhmadas should be two, four &c.) and uneven (three or five &c.) at & (pārvapa) śrāddha for the pitts; the brālmanas should be seated in a pure (covdunged) plot screened on all sides and sloping towards the south. At the darva (part of pārvad& śrāddha yhen Viśpe-devāh are to be invoked) two brāhmanas facing the east should sit down and three brāhmaṇas facing the north should be seated in the rite for the pitrs or only one may be seated for each (i, e. in darva and in patrya), The same rule applies to a śrāddha for waternal ancestors. In both (pitrśrāddha and mātāmahaśrāddha) the worship of Viśve devas may be performed separately or simultaneously 983.

After serving the food in the plates, he should invoke over the plates the mantra 'the earth is thy992 support', he should take hold of the thumb of the brāhmanas and put it on the food (served in the plates) with the mantra 993 'idam Visnur' ("Visnu strode over this' Rg, I. 22. 17, Vāj. S. V. 15, Tai 8. I, 2, 13, 1). The performer should then mutter the Gāyatrī verse (Rg. III 62. 10, Vā). $. ILI, 35, Tai, S. 1. 5. 6. 4) together with 'Om' and the 

Vyūbrtis' and the three yerses begianing with 'Madhu pāta' (Rg. I, 90, 6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27-29, Tai. S IV.2 9.3), he should say 'partake (of the food) as you please' and the brahmanas also should eat the food silently, He should serve without anger or bustle food fit for being offered as havis (in a śrāddha) and liked by the brāhmanas till they are satiated (so that some food is left in their plates) and should repeat (while the brāh mapas are engaged in eating) sacred texts and the texts for Japa (Gayatri &c. already referred to in Ya] I. 239 above). The sacred texts to be repeated according to the Mit on Yāj. I. 240 are the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90.* 1-16), the Pāvamani verses (i. a.

It may be that the japa of sacred texts is to be done by the performer wearing the sacred thread in the upavita way as stated by Hemādri p. 1070 and the Madana-pārijāta p. 599, but the Śrāddhatattva (p. 231) is opposed to this and relies on Manu II, 279. Certain Verses from the Purāpas also are to be recited such as the verses from the Varābapurāna (14. 26-31) and Vispupurāna (II, 15. 31-36, which are identical with the preceding) quoted by the Kalpataru on śrāddha (p. 197), Aparārka (p. 502) and Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 109), the first and last of which are quoted in the note belos 994. The Garudapurāda (Ācārakhanda 218.20 ff.)prescribes that while the brāhmanas are eating one may recite a eulogy of prips such as the 'saptavyādha' verses 994a. Then, after holding the food in his hands, the performer should ask the brāhmadas "are you satisfied' (and after they reply that they are satisfied) he should tell them that there is food still left (and ask them what to do with it) and after taking their per

On these the T (p. 231) says "GETTATATHMATE HEATSTOOTER सप्तन्याधा इतिच पठ्यते". These very verses occur in the अग्निपुराण chap. 117. 56–57. The story is very clearly set out in art 1, Chapters 21-24 and the Matsyapurana chap 20-21. Seved pupils of Garga guarding their guro's cow thought of eating that cow as they were famisbed, But the youngest said 'let us make use of the cow's flesh in sraddha, so that we may be saved from sin', Two of the brothers became daiva brābmanas, three became pitr-brābbanas, one became the giver and the 7th became a guest, They told the guru that the cow was eaten by a tiger They passed through several births first as seven hunters, then deer in Kalajara bill and so on 

Sraddha ultimately saved them. The same story is DarTated in Padma V. 10.49-125, and V, 47.282-304 (in which last the disciples are said to have been those of E) After becoming hamsas three of them became Lings (a king and two ministers, acc. to fit) and cared not for the other world. The four others knew the path to moksa, sent word to the three with these verses saying that they four had started on the long road to the other world (PEAT , ) and asking the other three not to be immersed in the mire of wordliness (74... ). The story also occurs in the fragreret (SATHICAT Chap. 41.24 ff). It is interesting to aote that in the faina Uttaradhyayana-sūtra (S. B. E vol. 45 p 56 ) the echoes of this story of the brothers are beard for illustrating the influence of karman,

Many of the Puradas contain detailed descriptions of the śrāddba to be performed on every amāvāsyā; for example, Matsya 17. 12-60 (closely resembling Yāj. 225-259), Vispu purāna II. 15. 13-49, Mārkandeya 28 37-60, Kūrma (IL %%. 20-62), Padma (srstikhanda) 9. 140-186), Brahmānda (Upod ghatapada, cbap, 12), Skanda VI. 224. 3-51, Vishudharmottara I 140, 6-44. The Agpipurāna chap. 163 verses 2-42 are the same (vith very slight variations and the omission of 23 verses) as Yāj. I. 227-270; while Agni cbap. 117 contains many yerses that closely follow the Asy. Gr and Yāj, Similarly the Garuda purāpa contains numerous verses that are identical with Yajnavalkya's. For example, compare Yaj. I, 229-239 with Garuda T. 99. 11-19. The Purāpas closely follow the Grbya sūtras, Manu and Yājñavalkya and often employ the same mantras and formulas, though here and there they introduce some details. As remarked by the Varāhapurāna 1451, the procedure for śrāddha is the same in all Paradas ( iyam sarva purānesu sāmānyā paitriki kriya). For sample, a summary of the procedure in the Padma (ersti 9. 140-186) is set out here, The performer having honoured the Viśve-devah (i e, the brāb mana or bralmanas invited to represent them) with a seat and with yava grains and flowers should fill two yessels vith water and should place them on a pavitra of darbhas The water should be offered with the verse "śam no depir' (Rg. X, 9.4) and the yava grains with 'Yaposi'. Theyo should be invoked with the verse 'Vißve devāsah' (Rg. IL 41 13) and yayas should be scat tered about with the two verses "Viśve devāsah' (Rg. II. 41. 13-14) and be should scatter about yara grains with the verse 'thou art gaya, the king of grains &c.' ( quoted 1003 below). After decking the brāhmanas with sandalwood paste and flowers

After taking leave of the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas that have been honoured with arghya he should begin the pitr yazña, He should prepare seats with darbhas on them, worship three vessels, place pavitras on them and pour water in them with 'śam no devir' (Rg. X. 9 4), should oast gesamum grains in them with 'tilosi' and then put in them sandalwood and flowers, (Then verses 147-152 speak about the vessels to be employed). He then should announce the names and gotra of his ancestors and give darbhas in the hands of the brāhmanas. He should then request brāhmapas vith the words 'I shall invite the pitrs' and when they reply 'let it be so' he should invoke the pitrs with the two verses 'usantas tvā' (Rg. X. 16.12) and 'ā yantu' (Vaj. S. 19.58). Then, having offered ar ghya to the brāhmadas (representing the pitrs) with.'yā divya' (vide 2. 985), having given them sandalwood pasto and the other things including garment as the last, he should collect the remainder of the water (in the argiya vessels) into the vessel neant for the father and should keep aside the latter to the north with its top turned downwards with the words 'thou art a seat of the pitrs'. Then he should begin to serve various kinds of food after bringing the utensils in which the food was cooked and holding them with both hands. (Verses 157-165 speak of the various foods to be offered and the periods of gratification caused thereby to the pitrs).

The remains of the food eaten by the brābmapas Temain (unremoved or unripad) ti]] the brahmadas are discaissed; then he should perform the (usual) daily rites Varstadera, balshoma2009 &c. The remnants of food that lie on the ground are the share of the group of slaves that vere straight-forward and not roguish (dishonest or shirkers). The performer holding a vessel full of water and muttering the Ferse 'Fāje vāje' (Rg. VII. 38 8, Vāj S. 18. 18, Tai. S 17. 8. 2) should touch the brāhmaṇas with the tip of kusas and dismiss them. He should follow them out of his house for eight paces, should circumambulate them, should then return with his rela tives, sons and vife, should then perform the daily Vaisvadera and balihoma. Then after Vaiśvadeya he should together with his relatives, sons, guests and servants partake of the food that remains in the cooking pots after what was eaten by the brāhmanas, 

It should be noticed how closely the Padmapurana follows the procedura (including the mantras ) contained in Yajna. Yalkya. What procedure the author of a Purana follors depends upon his learning and the sūtra that he studied. For example, the Visgudbarmottara 1140 appears to rely on the Āp gr. and the Ap. M. P. (IL 19-20), since I 140.12 refers to Āp M.P. I. 19.1 , 1. 140, 29-30 to Ap. M. P. I. 19. 14-16, I, 140.35 to Āp M P. I 20.1. Similarly, Skapda (VI 224 3-51) closely follows Āśv. go and Yāj. 

Oring to the difference in details of śrāddha in the several gshyagūbras, the smrtis and the purānas, an important question arises whether a person should perform a śrāddha rite only in Bocordance with the grhyasūtra of his own Veda or Sabhā or whether he may perform it after the inclusion (upasainhāra) of

the several items found in other sūtras and smrtis though not included in the kalpa or grhya sūtra of his own Sākhā, This topic is discussed at great length by Hemādri (on śrāddha ) pp. 748–759 and briefly by Medhātithi on Manu II, 29 and XI. 216, by the Mit on Yāj. IIL 325, Aparārka p. 1053 and others. Those who are for strictly following the details in one's own sutra alone argue as follows: If one were at liberty to include details other than those contained in one's own sūtra, the order of the details (lama) given in one's sūtra and the time specified for each detail would be interfered with Besides, if the addition of details were permissible, one would be liable to the charge of giving up the usages of one's own family handed down for generations. These objectors rely upon such passages as that of the Visnudharmottara which states 'He who violating ( the dictates of) his own sūtra acts according to & sūtra meant for others, treats thereby his own sage ( the author of his sūtra) as unauthoritative and incurs ( the blame of doing what is in proper,'1010 The smrtis that contain additional details may be meant for those men who have no kalpa or grlıya sūtra of their own or they may be useful for sūdras. 

Those who espouse the view that as far as possible all details found in several grhyasūtras and smrtis on one rite should be included by every one rely mainly on Jaimini II. 4.8-33 which is called 'sākhantarādhikarapanyaya' or 'saryaśākhāpratyaya nyaya'. The principal sutra is Jai. II, 4. 9.1011 It is established in this sūtra that the prayorana (purpose ) or phala (reward to be secured) of the rite is the same in different sūtras and smrtis. For example, the rewards of śrāddha are stated to be the same in all sūtras and smrtis (vide notes 787–790 above); then the dravia (materials) and the deity are the same (in Pārvana śrāddha the deities are the paternal ancestors and the materials,

vir, kursas, tilas, wator, vog50]s, foods &o, are the same in all works). Tho effort that is enjoined (the vidhz) is the same and the noino (Pūı vanasruddha, Ekoddista śrāddha &c.) is the same. Thorofore, on account of those various signs one easily recog nixos that the samo rito is being dealt with by all sūtras, even if many of them differ in dotajls. It cannot be said that surtis vill ho usoful for those who havo no sutras of their own. Each man of the first three varnas is attached to some sūlra or other by tho trodition of his family or caste. Similarly, the sportis cannot bo bold to be meant for śūdras alone, since the smrtis miainly doal with ipanayana, the study of the Vedas, agnihotra and other matters with which a śūdra has no concern. Similara ly, the ohjoction that if dotails were allowed to be inserted from othor sūtras and smrtis tho krama and kūla prescribed in one's sūtra might have to be set aside, the reply is contained in Jai. I 3.5-7 (explained at groat length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 841-848) 1012 The fruli says 'after getting ready a bundle of kuśa grass he prepares the zedi (altar)'. Here a certain order of acts is laid down, If after a bundle of kuśas is got roady, the man has a sneezo, he has to sip water (perform ūciniana ) immodiately as laid down by Manu V. 145 and Vas. UI 38 before he prepares the vedi. So the objector says the krana will be intorfored with. The reply is that the sequence (krama) is only a characteristic of the items in the śruti passage, that all that is meant is that the making of the altar follows the getting ready of a buśa bundle, but that it is not meant that the making of tho vedi should follow immediately after the bundle is got ready. Therefore, the conclusion is that whatever detail is not in conflict with one's own sakhā or sūtre may be in oluded in the rite one is about to perform, but if there is a direct conflict, then one should stick to one's own sūtza. Ar observed by Katyayana whatever is declared, whether in great detail or in brief, in one's own grhyasūtra about a rite, if he performs that much, it may be taken that he has done all that is required of bim; but what is not handed down in one's sakhā (or sūtra) but 18 contained in another sākha and is not in conflict with one's Dgn sākha, should be performed by the learned, as in the case of

Egnihotra and the like'. 1913 The first verse of Kātyāyana may be explained as applying where one's śākhā or sūtra deals with a matter without requiring any addition or as the next best course where one is not able to supplement one's sūtra owing 

The to some unseen cause or owing to human difficulties. Sangraha says that where different items of the śrāddha rite are declared to be performed at different times and there is no agreement among the sages, one should follow one's grhya sūtra, but where one's grhyasūtra is silent as to a certain item or as to the stage when it is to be performed, there is an option and one may follow the opinion of some sage as to that item. 1014 It appears that even the ancient grhya sūtras exhibit tendencies that led to the sarvasakha-pratyaya-nyaya e. g. Asv. gr. (g. in n 966) employs several passages (such as Tilosi', 'Ya. divya,' which do not occur in the Rgveda.) 

It is owing to this maxim of 'sarvaśākhā-pratyayanyāya' that medieval digests go on heaping up details from all smrtis and purānas in their descriptions of the several grāddbas, the procedures of which were not originally very extensive.

(VOL who have shaved themselves and pared their nails, should offer them materials for brushing the teeth and request them to sit down on separate seats, then give them oil and water for bathing. It will be seen that hero the purāpa has added several details that were not provided for by the Aśv. gr. (1, 966), Manu (III. 208 ), Yaj. (1 226) and even by some of the puranas such as the Varaha 14, 8, which begin the procedure with seat ing the brāhmanas in the afternoon on seats after welcoming them. Many more examples could be given, but that attempt is not made owing to considerations of space. 

Before proceeding to give some idea as to how the pārvana śrāddha was dealt with in medieval and modern times, observa tions must be made on several relevant matters, on which there is a difference of views or which are important in a general way. 

When the invited brābmapas come after noon, it is pro vided in some of the purānas that two mandalas should be made in front of the performer's residence for receiving the brāh madas. For example, the Nāradapurāna states 1016 the mandala for a brāhmana performer should be square (four cornered) in size, for a ksatriya triangular, circular for ā vaisya and for a śūdra mere sprinkling of the ground with water is enough.' The mandalas should be made on ground smeared with cowdung and with water mixed with cow's urine. Of the two mapdalas one should be on the northern side sloping towards the north and the other on the southern side sloping towards the south. On the northern mandala kuśas with points towards the east should be placed along with aksata (unbroken or whole) grains and on southern one double-folded kuśas should be placed along with sesamum grains. The northern mandala should generally be two cubits on each side while the southern one should be four cubits on each side. The brahmana or brābmanas that repre sent the Visiedevāh should be honoured in the northern mandala first by the performer himself with water for washing their feet after bending his right knee and the brābmapas representing the pitrs should be then honoured in the southern mandala with water for washing the feet (hence called padya) after bending his left knee. The mantra at the time of offering põdya is 'san

The anoient sūtras and smrtis liko those of Manu and Yaj. (T. 229) say generally that the Viśvedevāh are to be invoked, but some of the later smigis (such as Prajāpati, versos 179-190) and puradas contain verses onumorating ten names of Viśve devās and assiga two bach (out of the ton) to five olassos of śraddhas They say: 1019 "in śrāddha performed in an eṣti tho V2svedevas kre Kratu and Dakṣa, in & Nāndimukha sraddha they are Vasu and Satya, in Kainyaśrāddha Dhuri and Locana, in naimittika sraddha Kala and Kāma and in Parvana-śraddha Purūravas and Ardrava'. According to the Sm. C. and Hemādri a seat (asana) is to be given to the Vaiśvadova brāhmaṇas and invocations are to be made in the several śrāddhas aftor taking the names enumerated above. The Mit on Yāj I. 229, Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 1225) and other digests state that the mantras

The general rule is that the Vaidyadeva brāhmanas are to be seated facing the east and the patrya brāhmanas facing the north (Yāy I. 228, Varāha 14. 11), but there were at least five differing views about the directions which the brābmanas were to face as Hemādri (on sraddha p. 1200) points out. It is fur ther pointed out by Kemādri and others (like Yāj I. 247) that in a]] items in the procedure of grāddha the Vaiśvadevika brāhmanas have precedence except in the matter of washing the hand smeared with the remains of food and the final dismissal of the brāhmanas at the end of the śrāddha,1019 It may be noted that in southern and western India brāhmanas invited at śrāddha are worshipped, while in Bengal it is the effigy made with darbhas (darbhabatu) that is worshipped as shown by the late M. M. Haraprasad Shastri (Catalogue of Mss. vol. III p. 406).

The mantra is 'Perpetual adoration to the gods, to pitrs and to the great Yogins, to svadbā, to svāha'. The Sra C (on śrāddha

A certain order of words about referring to the ancestors in offering a seat, offering kuśas on seat, and arghya is laid down by Brhaspati, 101 some of the purāpas and the digests. As altnost in every case there are different views here also. Bṛhaspati says: "when giving a seat, when offering argiya, or pindas, in offering ablutions of water on pindas, the performer has to declare his relation to each of the ancestors, the names and gofras of the ancestors and also the form if which each of the ancestors is to be contemplated (viz as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya respectively). It is further laid down that the genitive is to be employed for the ancestor's name in offering a seat (to the pitrya brāhmaṇa) and aksayyodala, the objective in invoking the pitrs, the dative in offering food, the vocative in other cases. 

It is laid down that the performer has to take ācarana (sip water) in śrāddha rite sic times viz., at the commencement of śrāddha, when washing the feet of invited brahmanas, in wor shipping them, in making the urkera, in offering pindas and at the end of the sraddha 1022

IV.8.1 (quoted above in n. 9GG 'etasniin kale ... dinam) and passages of the purānas such as the Varāba (13.51) vibhave sati viprobhyo asmān uddiśya dasyati', the Mahārnavaprakāśa, Harihara and some othors hold that brāhmanas were the recipients, while othora Jike Sridatta, relying on indications furnished by śrutt passages liko Vāj. S. 19. 36 (alıṣan pitarah amimadanta piarah) and such formulas as mar-elał le argiyam' or 'etadrah pitaro võsah,' hold that tho real recipients intended were the pitrs, but, as tho pitrs liad gone to another world and could not be bodily prosent to receive the gifts of such things as sandlewood paste, flowers and clothes, the latter were only handed over or assigned to the brāhmanas who were for the moment contemplated as not differont from tho pitrs.1023a Vide Sm, C. (śrāddha pp. 447 449), Sr. Pr. pp. 30-31 for a discussion of these two yiov points. It should, however, be noted that the water giren to the brahmanas and the dal sınā given to them were only meant for the brāhmanas, the former for purification and the latter for the inexhaustible merit that daksidā to brahmapas conferred. 

It is to be noted that in the invocation (aralana) of the pitis there is a divergence of views as to the mantras to be employed and also as to the stage when it is to be made, Henādri (śrāddha, pp. 1254-56) states that there were five different views on the latter point, the three most important of which were that āvāhana should come before giving darbhas as āsana on the left side of the seats of the patria brāhmanas or after giving such darbhas or after agnaukarana. As regards the former (viz, the mantras), Yā). (1 232-233), the Brahmanda purana and several others say that the invocation mantra is "uśantas-tya' (Rg. X 16. 12, Val. S 19 70, Tai S 1. 6.12.1) and after the āvāhana the performer should perform japa of the verse'a yantu nah' (Vāj. S. 19, 58 ). The Vispudharma sūtra 102!

Mantras of avāhana permission from the brahmanas should invite the Manes. Having driven away the Yātudhānas (demons) by strewing grains of sesamum and by reciting the two mantras (the first of which begins with 'may the Asuras go away ') he should invite the Manes with the four mantras 'come near, ye Manes'', * conduct them bere, O Agnil', 'May my (ancestors ) come near', 'this is your (share), O Manes'. Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1260-1267 ) points out how the mantras differ according to different writers, 

There is a great deal of discussion about agnaulcarana mon tioned in Yaj, I. 236-237. The Mit points out that if a man has kept srauta fires by the sarvadhāna method then in the pārvana-śrāddha that he offers after pipdapitryajāa he offers homa in the Daksināgai, as he has no aupāsana (i, e. grhya) fire and supports this by quoting a passage which occurs in the Visnudharmottara-purāna, 1025 But if a man consecrates the śrauta fires by the ardhādhāna 1026 method, then he has to offer pārvana homa in the aupāsana fire and one who is without śrauta fires and has kept up only aupāsana fire has to offer homa in that fire, One who has neither the śrauta fires por the grhya fire offers it in the brāhmana's hand only. The Mit. relies on Manu IIL. 212 and on two verses from a grhya and comes to the conclusion that one who has consecrated srauta fires performs homa in daksina fire in the case of Anyastakya śrāddha, the śrāddha on the day previous to Astakā, the grāddha

performed in the dark half of each month on some day from the 5th and in the case of pārvana-śrāddba, but he performs, in the case of kūmya, ābbyudayika, Ekoddista and Astakā grāddhas, homa only on the pitrya brāhmana's hand; while for one who has kept no sacred fire the lama is to be made only in the pittya brāhmana's band. Vide Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1328-1344), Balambhatti (on ācāra p. 518). The Todarādanda (śrāddba saukuya ) following Manu TII, 282 states that one who is an Agnihotrin cannot perform a pāryana-śrāddha on any day except on darsa (i. e, on amāvāsyā). 

Another important question on which thero is great diver gence concerns the number of abutis to be offered in agnau harana, the deities to whom the loma was to be offered, the order in which the deities were to be named and the form of words to be used. On those matters there appears to have been divergent views from very ancient times. According to the Sat, Br. II. 4. 2. 12-13 the āhutis were only 1027 two, they were offered to Agni and Soma in that order and the word svāhā was used at the end. According to the Tai. Br I 3. 10.2-3 2028 the khutis were three, they were to be offered to Soma, Agni and to Yamna in that order and the formula ended with 'syadha namah (and not with 'svāhā '). It is therefore that a verse of Katyā yana 1029 says " whether to employ the yord 'spāhā' or the words * svadhā namad', whether and when to wear the sacred chord in the yajñopavita form or prācināvita form and what was to be the number of ahutis-all these have to be understood from one's own sūtra," The difference of views which is noticed as far back as the Brāhmanas persists in the sūtras, smartis, purānas and is briefly indicated here. The Āp. Gr S. (quoted above in 17. 981 ) speaks of thirteen āhutis, seven with food and

IV. 7.20, Saṅkha Likhita,1030 Kathaka-grhya, Narada-purana (purvardha.28.48) and Markandeya-purada. Three āhutis are mentioned by most of the surtis and puranas, such as Band. Dh.S. II. 14.7, 1031 San. Srauta. IV.3 and grhya IV.1.13, Visnu Dh. S. 73, 12, Manu III. 211, Varahapurana1052 (14.21-22), Brahmanda-purana (Upod ghātapāda 11. 93–94), Viṣoudharmottara I 140. 19. It is here that various combinations of the order of the deities and of the words 'svaha' and 'svadha' occur. The texts of a few works are cited below for illustration. Some give the order as 'Soma accom panied by the pitrs, Agni the carrier of havya, Yama Angiras;' while others give it as 'Agni the carrier of kavya, Sona accompanied by the pitrs, Yama Vaivasvata &c,' It is further provided that the āhuiz to Agni is made to the southern side of the fire, to Soma on the northern part of it and in the middle of the two sides to Vaivasvata (Yama ).1033 

Various rules of etiquette about serving food, about the way brahmapas are to eat and related matters have been laid down from ancient times and are observed even now. The Sm, C (p.465-470), Hemadri (raddha pp. 1367-1384), the Sr. Pr. pp. 116-123 and other digests contain elaborate rules on these 

matters. Yaj.I. 237 prescribes that what remains after offering homa should be served in the plates meant for the brahmanas representing the Fathers and the plates should preferably be

O. notes that Yama and the Vayupurāpa say that the homa should be in the hand of the daiva brābmana and that on account of this conflict there is an option. It is further provided that a portion of the food from which agnaukarana was effected should be kept aside for making pindas (Mārkandeya and Garuda). The food should be served by the performer himself wearing the sacred thread in the vajśopavita form or by his wife of the same oaste or by some attendant who is purified, Manu (IIL 224-229, 231-233, 236-238) contains several rules 1032 "Himself holding the vessels full of food with both hands the performer should slowly place them near the brābmapas seated for dinner while think ing of his ancestors. That food, which is brought near the brāhmades without (the containing vessel being held in) both lands, is snatched away by wioked asuras. The per former being himself pure and concentrating his mind (only on the serving of food ) should place the vessels containing the

Rules about serving food. side dishes viz. brotlıs, vegetables, milk, curds, gheo and honey on the ground (and not on a wooden stool or the like ). The vessels placed on the ground should contain various kinds of food (such as sweetmeats, pāyasa), fruits and roots, delicious flesh, spiced or perfumed drinks. Having brought near the brahmanas all the vessels containing food, he should serve it in the plates declaring the characteristic of each kind of food (saying this is sweet, this is sour' &c.). The performer wliile serying should not shed tears (remembering his ancestors ), be should not become angry, should not utter falsehood, he should not touch the (vessel containing) food with his foot and should not serve food with a violent jerk, Whatever is liked by the brāhmanas should be served to them without any grumbling and he should talk about Brahma ( or about Vedic riddles ), because that is agreeable to the pitrs. The perfornier himself, being pleased, should ( by his sweet speech ) gladden the brāhmadas, should make them partake of food without Jiurty, and should urge them on frequently (to take more food) by declaring the good points of the various items of food. All food should be steaming hot and the brāhmanas should partake of it silently and should not themselves speak of the good points of the food even when questioned by the performer. When the food is hot, when the brāhmanas eat in silence and when the good qualities of the food are not declared by the brāhmanas, the Fathers partake of it. When a brāhmana (at a śrāddha dinner) partakes of food, having his head covered with a garment (& turban &c)or facing the south or having his sandals on, evil spirits partake of the food (and not the Fathers).' As early as Gaut., it is provided that the food for the braumapas should be of the highest sort and should be enriched by condiments and flavoured, 

Some of the other rules are : The Prajāpati-smrti (verses 57-62) states who should cook the food for the śrāddha dinner. The wife, any fortunate (or handsome) woman of the performer's gotra whose husband is living and who has a son or brother and is devoted to waiting upon her elders, the performer's teacher's wife, his maternal uncle's wife, paternal or maternal aunt, bis sister, his daughter or daughter-in-law, all of them having their husbands alive, should engage in the cooking of the food for śrāddha. Women of good family, who have a large progeny, whose husbands are alive and who are about 50 years old or these women if they have become widows, and the wife of one's paternal uncle or brother, one's mothers (natural or

In the Anuśāsana parva (92.15) it is stated that a womau bolonging to a gotra other than that of the deceased should not lo employed for cooking srāddha food. One's brother, patornal uncle, brother's son, sister's son, one's son, pupil, one's daughtor's son or daugliter's husband may also engage in cook ing tho srāddha food, but not a woman who wears a white and wet garmont, wlio lias let her hair Joose, who does not wear it biodico, who is ill or who has bathed her head. Before the brahmanas begin to eat, the food should be first served in tlo platos for the Vaisvadeva brāhumanas and then in those of tho po yu hrālmanns (Visau Dh S. 73 13-14), but once the brālimanas havo begun to ent there is no such precedenoe, what cvor ench brāhmana may be noted as requiring should be served to him (as indicated by Manu III. 231 ). The performer of the śrāddho whon sorving food to the brahmanas (including pitrya) wears luis sacred thread in the upavita form Though it is said that tho food should be lot, tliat does not apply to such eatables 25 curds, fruits and roots and flavoured 1035 drinks (as Saṅkha XIV.13 and Skandapurana say) As Hemādri (śrāddha p. 1371) points out, the sorring of food in a sraddha rite should be done with the rigut hand supported by the left; besides, nothing should be sorved with the bare hand or with a single hand, but with a wooden ladle or otller utensil (but not an iron one). All cooked food, all side dishes and ghee should be served with a ladle (and not with the bare hand ) but not water or eatables like laddus No salt was to be directly served ( Vispu Dh S. 79.12). In Katyāyana's Śrāddha-sūtra it is provided 1036 "The food that remains after agnauharana should be served in the plates of the pitrya brāhmabas and the performer should touch

each plate for those brāhmanas after repeating the mantra 'the earth is thy vessel, the sky is the cover, I offer nectar in the brahmana's nectar-like mouth; svāha'. Then the performer plunges the (right) thumb of the pitrya brāhmana in the food ( the remains of the homa in fire) with the rk or yajus addressed to Visnu; and after scattering sesamum grains all round the place where the dinner is to go on with the mantra * the asuras and rākgasas) are struck and driven away he (the performer ) should serve hot food very much liked (by the departed or by the brahmanas )". Yaj. I. 238 briefly refers (as translated above) to the mantras and the item of plunging the thumb of the brahmanas in the food; and so does the Baud. Dh. S. also (II. 8. 15-16). The Kalika-purana. prescribes1037 that the thumb of the brāhmana should be moved about in the food covered with ghee and honey with the mantra "the earth is thy vessel &c.' because Visnu in the form of the thumb protects food meant for sacrifices to gods and nanes. The Baud. Pitrmedhasūtra provides that while plunging the thumb of the brāhmana in the food served it should be so arranged that the nail of the thumb is not sineared with food. 1038 Vasistha provides that the brahmanas eating śrāddha food should always hold the plate from which they are eating with (the left ) hand till the end of the dinner. Saṅkha-Likhita provide 1039 that brāhmanas (eating śrāddba food ) should not declare the good or bad points of the food served, should not say what is untrue, should not praise each other, nor should they say there is plenty of food and drink (and so do not serve more food),

History of Dharmadāsira 

(Vol. except by signs made with the hand.' Whatever is offered in a brahmana's hand (by way of agnaukarana) and whatever food is placed in tho plales should be mixed up and eaten. Hemādri quotos passages from the Maitrāyaniya-sūtra and from the Skandapurano setting out the mantras wherewith certain articles were to bo sorved; e. g, the Skandapurāna says that piyasa should be served with tho Verse 'naino vah pitaro' (Vaj. S. II. 32. Tai, S. III, 2.5, 5), clarified butter with the mantra 'Tojosi sukram', curds with the mantra "dadhikrāvno' (Rg. IV. 39. 6, Vaj. S. 23. 32, Tai. S. 1.5. 11. 4). Ap Dh, S. (II. 8. 18. 11) provides that the loavings of a sraddha dinner should not be given to ono who is inferior to the invited brāhmadas in qualition and Manu II. 249 states that the man who after oating srāddha dinnor gives the leavings to a sūdra falls in the 

Kalasātra Hell. 

The Matsyapurīna and some other works provide that the brālmanas should pronounce blessings on the performer (who faces the east) after they have sipped water and have been given water, flowers and akṣata grains. The performer prays 'May our Tatliers be not terrible (i, o, be kind) to us.' The brābmapas reply "lot it be so'. The performer prays "May our family grow', 'May donors increase in our family and also food', 'May these blessings turn out to be true'. To all these the brāhmanas reply after each one of the prayers 1010 May it be so'. There aro rules about the time when the leavings or particles of food in the plates of the brālmadas that ate the dinner should be removed or swept away Vas. (XI. 21–22) and the Kūrma piirāna provide that the leavings of food should not be removed till the Sun sets, since streams of declar flow from them, which are drunk by the (spirits of) those departed persons for whom no vater was offered. Manu III, 265 (which is the same as Matsya 17 56 and Padma, Srstikhanda 9.185) provides another rule that the leavings of the food in the plates may remain where they are till the brāhmanas are dismissed and depart,

Rules about removal of leavings 

469 

Hemādri (śrāddha, p. 1512 )1041 therefore provides that if the per former has another house the leavings may not be removed till sunset, but if he has only one house, they may be removed after the brāhmadas have gone away (vide Yaz I. 257, Matsya 17.56 ). It is further provided by Brhaspati 1042 that the plates should not be removed before the brāhmanas Pronounce the word 'svasti', and Jātūkarnya 1043 and the Skandapurāna say that the plates and the leavings should be removed by the performer himself or by his pupil or son, but not by women nor by a child nor by one who is not of the same caste Manu III 258 provides that, after the brāhmanas have left, the performer should look at the south and pray to the pitrs for certain blessings contained in Manu II 259 which are the same as Yāj I 246 translated above (vide p. 447), Vispu Dh, S 73. 28, Matsya 16. 49-50, The Ap. gr. 209 (q. in note 981), Āp Dh. S II 7. 17. 16, Manu II, 264, Yāj. I, 249 provide that the performer should partake of the remainder of the food cooked for the śrāddha along with his wife, paternal and maternal relatives after recit ing (according to Haradatta) the Yājusa mantra (Ap. M, P, IT. 20.26 ) which means 'entering the life breath I offer nectar; my soul is centred in Brahman for the sake of immortality. The Āp. gr and Āp. Dh. 8. provide 1044 that the performer must eat at least a morsel of the food left after serving to the brāhmanas. Vyāsa and Devala prescribe that on the day of śrāddha the per former must not observe a fast (even if he usually does so as on Ekādaśī or Sivarātra). A way out was provided by the Bra hmavaivarta-purāna by recommending that the performer should merely smell the remnants of the śrāddha food. Vide

[Vol. 

Homidri (Grāddha, pp. 1519-1521 ) for the discussion, Hemādri (p. 1485) refers to the practice (observed even now) that after the porformer receives the blessings referred to above, his son, grandson and the like should offer adoration to the devatās in tho form of pindas. Tho brālımadas should praise the good characteristics of the food servod at the end of the graddha coremony, 5035 The brālmanas should not get up from the dinner, carclosely leaving remnants of food in their plates, but they pay loave in the plates a little food except milk, curds, honoy or barloy flour. 1016 

There were soveral views as to the exact stage at which the offerings of pindas wero to be made, According to Sān. Gr. IV. 1.9., Asy, gr. IV. 8. 12, 2017 Sapkha 14. 11, Manu II. 260-261, Yay, I 242 and several other works, the performer offers the Jumps of boiled rice after the brāhmapas have finished eating their dinner, The pindas aro made with boiled rice mixed with sesame and aro placed on darbhas on a clean spot and at a distance of about one fratni from 1018 the plates in which the brahmadas ato and the performer faces the south. Here again there are two opinions, ono being that pindas were to be offered before the brahmanas sip water (perform ūcamana) after dinner (e. g. Āśv, gr. IV. 8. 12-13, Srāddha-sitra of Kātyāyana, kandika 3), while othors hold that thioy were to be offered after the brāhmapes have rinsed their mouth and taken ūcamana. Another view referred to as the view of some by Sān, gr. IV. 1. 10 and Manu II 261 was that pindas were to be offered to the ancestors first after honouring the invited brāhmanas or after agnaukarana and thon the brābmanas were to partake of the dinner The

Time of offering pindas

Brahmāndapurāna 1019 emphatically asserts that this is the correct position as stated by Brhaspati. The Visnu Dh. S. (73 15-24) provides that the pindas are to be offered to the ancestors while the brāhmanas are actually eating. A fourth view is that of the Ap. gr.24.9, Hir gr. (II. 12.2-3) which state that the per former1050 should, after the brahmanas have eaten and gone away and he has followed and circumambulated them, offer pindas, Owing to this conflict of views Hemādri (quoting smrti) and the Madanapārijāta (p 600) say that each one should follow the procedure laid down in his own śākhā 1051 Hemādri adds that those in whose grhyasūtra no special time is mentioned for pindadāna should follow the view that pindas are to be offered after the brāhmanas have partaken of the dinner and sipped water. The Sr. P. (p. 247) endorses this view.1052 The pindas were to be deposited on bunches of (25) darbhas for each pinda, Aparārka on Yāj. I24 states that in all cases without exception pindas were to be offered near the plates from which the brābmapas took their meals, while Hemādri vho relies on Katyāyana's word 'ucchistasannidhau' says that where the performer is an altāgni the pindas were to be offered near his sacred fire, but when a perfornier had not kept the sacred fires pindas were to be offered near the plates from which brāhmanas. ate the traddha food. The Sraddhasara (p 163) quotes Atri to the effect that pindas should be offered at a distance of three arabnis from where the brāhmapas ate the śrāddha dinner and that in such śrāddhas as Navaśrāddhas Vaiśvadeva is to be performed before pindadāna and that it is to be performed after

There is another conflict of views as regards the ancestors to whom pindas are to be offered at the śrāddha on amāvāsya. - Most of the ancient Vedic works refer only to the three paternal ancestors as the devatās of the Pārvada-śrāddha and not to any other relatives. The three paternal ancestors are separately the devatās of śrāddha and 20cumulatively, as indicated by the Aśv, Srauta I, 6.15 and Visu Dh S, 73 13-14, The important questions are whether the vives of the paternal ancestors, viz, the mother, the grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother were associated with their husbands in ancient times and secondly, whether the three paternal ancestors of one's mother viz. the maternal grandfather, the maternal great-grandfather and the maternal great-great-grandfather were invoked together with their wives in the Pārvada The answer to both these questions so far as the Vedas and Brāhmanas are concerned is in the negative, Vide Tai, S.1.8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I 3. 10, 11. 6. 16, Vāj. Ś, 19 36-37, Sat. Br, I. 4.2. 16, in all of which the only persons expressly named are the pitis and three paternal ancestors It may be noted, however,

Vide 1053 Aśv, Śr.; Sudarsang on Āp. gr. VII, 21, 2 states that the Sūtrakara and Bhāsgakāra did not speak of Mātāmabaśraddha as it is not obligatory for a daughter's son to offer it, The Sraddhasūtra of Kātyāyana 1054 speaks of three pindas being made for the paternal anoestors and three for the mother's paterna)

ancestors, The Gobhilasmrti provides 1055 that six pindas should be offered except in the Anvastakāśrāddha, the first śrāddha (on the 11th day), the sixteen śrāddhas and the yearly śrāddha for a deceased person. Dhaumya 1056 prescribes that where the paternal ancestors are honoured ( or fed) the mater nal ancestors also should be certainly honoured without making any difference (between the two classes); if he makes a dis tinction the performer will go to Hell. The Visnupurāda, 1057 the Brahwāndapurada and the Varāhapurāpa say that some hold that a śrāddha for maternal ancestors is to be performed separately while other sages hold that one śrāddha is to be offered at the same time to the paternal and maternal ancestors. Brhaspati (q. by Kalpataru on śrāddha p. 204) prescribes 1058 that one should offer pindas made from all food cooked for the 'srāddha and mixed with honey and sesamum grains for both paternal and maternal ancestors according to the rules of one's gruyasutra, The Varāhapurāna (14 40-41) says that pitrya brahmapas should be dismissed first and then the daiva brāh manas together with those for the mother's ancestors and that separate pindas were to be offered to the mother's paternal ancestors (14 37). Some held the view that the offering of pindas to maternal ancestors was obligatory for the putrikā putra 1059 (son of the appointed daughter) or for a daughter's son that inherited the wealth of his material grandfather. Bṛhat-Parāśara (chap. V. p. 153) mentions several views on this point. It seerns probable that when the appointment of a

daughter as a son became rate or went out of yogue the maternal ancestors came to be associated with the paternal ancestors in pārvada-śrāddha. 

The question when the wives of ancestors became associa ted with the male ancestors cannot be solved satisfactorily. The pitamahi is not mentioned in the extant Vedic Literature, But it is certain that the wives of male ancestors had come to be associated with their husbands in the sūtra period. Tor example, the Hir. Gr. I. 10 associates the mother, the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother with their respective husbands in the monthly śrāddha performed in the dark half. Similarly, the Baud. gr. II 11,34 not only associates in the Astaka sraddha the male maternal ancestors with the male paternal ancestors, but also their respective vives. The Ap, M. P. 1060 has mantras referring to the three male paterna) ancestors as well as their wives. The Sān. gr. (IV. 1,11) pro vides that behind the lumps for the paternal ancestors the per former places the lumps for their wives, putting something between the two sets of pindas and the commantator explains that darbhas are placed between the two sets. The Kauśika sūtra (88 12) also provides for the offering of pindas to the wives of male ancestors to the south of the pindas for male ancestors, The Aśv. gr. (II 5.4-5), while speaking of the Anvas. takya rite, refers to pindas to be offered to the wives of ances tors with the addition of rum and the scum of boiled rice. The Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra IV. 7 (after describing the Pinda pitryajña ip IV,5-6) notes that the difference between it and the ordinary monthly śrāddha is that in the latter pindas sro offered to the wives of the pitra 1061 Dr, Caland (in 'Ahnencult' p. 164) thinks that this inclusion of the women ancestors among those to whom pindas were to be offered was made by taking over from Anvastakya ceremonial described above. This con jacture does not look very probable. The Astakā rites existod from remote antiquity as shown above. If the offering of pindas to women ancestors were borrowed from the Anvastakys

ĪV) Participation of females in pindas offered 475 this item would have figured in all sātras just as Astali sra ddha does. It is rather more probable that the extension to women was a natural growth in course of time. Some of the smrtis emphasize the participation of the wives of paternal ancestors in the parmanasraddha offerings. Satatepe states 1062 : 'In what is offered to the pitīs after Sapiod ikaraga, the mother is a participant everywhere. A śraddha may be separately offered to the mother in the Anvastakā rites, in Viddhi-sraddha, at Gaya and on the anniversary of the day of her death; but in other cases it is performed along with the husband'. It is atated by Bfhaspati that the mother partakes of the sizddha food along with her husband (i. e. the father of the performer); that the same rule applies to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother 1005. The Kalpararu 1054 and others held that the wives of the paternal ancestors were not deratas in the pārvana-śrāddha, but they only enjoyed the ethereal food which came to the pitrs, while Hemādri and other sou thera writers held that the mother and other female ancestors were among the devatās of pārvada-śrāddha, but not the steg mother. There was a divergence of views whether the words 'mother', 'paternal grandmother' and 'paternal great-grand mother' included the co-wives (sapatnts) of these. Henadri (on sraddha pp.97-104) has a long disquisition on this question, According to one view the step-mother, the co-wife of the pita mahi and the co-wife of the prapitā mahi would be included in

Mantras at offering pindas - the usage of the Tai. s. in this matter, the reason being 100 that when the son offers a piṇda to his father and employs the formula 'this is thine and of those that follow thee', he would be included among those that follow the father and be thus offering a pioda to himself, which is inauspicious. It is provided by Gobbila-grhya 1071 that if he does not know the names of his ancestors he should put down the first pinda with the Formula *svadbā to the Fathers dwelling on the earth', (ho should put down) the 2nd pinda with the formula 'svadbā to the fathers dwelling in the air, the third with the formula 'svadbā to the Fathers dwelling in heaven' and should recite in a low voice the words 'Here, O Fathery, gladden yourselves, show your vigour each according to his own part,' Yama quoted by Kalpataru (on Sr. p 203), following Gobhila provides generally (whether the ancestors be known or not) that the first pinda should be offered to the father with the expression 'prthivi', the second to the grandfather in the aerial regions and the third to the paternal great-grandfather with the mantra 'dyaur darvi, The Visnu Dh.S (73 17-19) has similar provisions, the mantras respectively being 'prthivi darviraksita', 'antariksam darvi raksita,' dyaur-darviraksita... Medhātithi on Manu III. 194 says (following Asv. Sr and others) that if the names of the ancestors are not known he should simply say 'O Father, Grandfather' &c. If the gotra be not known then he should employ the gotra name Kasyapa. 1072

(Vol. size of the pipdas. Marici (quoted by Aparārka p. 507) provides that in pārvana-śrāddha the pinda should be of the size of undried āmalaka fruit, of the size of a bilva fruit in Ekoddista, in navaśrāddhas the pinda should be bigger than in any one of the preceding when offered every day during the days of impu rity on death, The Skandapurāda says that pindas should be of such a size as would enable a calf two years old to put it easily into its mouth. 1073 Angiras (q. by Sm. O p. 475 and Hemadri, srāddha p. 1429) prescribes that the pipdas may be of the size of kapittha or bilra fruit or of the size of a hen's egg or of an analala or badara fruit. In the Maitrāyaniya-sūtra 1074 it is said that the pinda for the paternal grandfather shonld be bigger than that for the father and should be in the middle (of the three pindas), that the pinda for the great-grandfather should be the largest of all. The next point is from what materials the pipdas were to be made. If pindas yere offered before agnaularan, they were to be made from the boiled rica (oaru) prepared for agnaukarana. If made after agnankarana, the pindas were to be made from the cooked food (reinaining after agnaukarapa) mixed with sesamum (vide Yaj I 242). If pindas were to be offered after the brahmanas took their dinnor, the pindas were to be made from the remainder of the food cooked for the brāhmanas which was to be mixed with tho boiled rice for agnaukarana as stated in Katyayana's Śruddha sutra. 1975 The pindas vere to be placed according to the Matsya 1076 on darbhas spread on the ground cleaned with water mixed with cow's dung and urine.

were to be placed and then pindas. The Vayupurāna provides that a line should be drawn on the altar or the ground with the root of a darbha to the accompaniment of the following mantras viz, 1077 'I destroy whatever is impure; I have killed all asuras, danavas, raksasas, yaksas, pisacas (goblins), guhyakas and yātudhānas' and the mantra 'struck down ( are the asuras and raksasas sitting on the Vedi)'. In Ap. Sr. I. 10.2, Manu III 217, Visnu Dh. S. 73.17-19, Yama (q. by Hemadri p. 1440), the Kalpataru (on Sr. p. 203), Maharnavaprakasa (g by Hemadri), Hemadri (Sr. pp. 1440-42) and Sr. P pp. 266-267 reference is made to adoration of the six seasons and the obeisance ( namaskāra ) to the pitrs in the words 'namo vah pitaro' (Vaj S II, 32 ) 1078 and the repetition of three mantras when each of the three pipdas is offered, some holding that the seasons were to be deemed as identified with 'rasa', 'sosa' and four other words (in Vaj.S II.33), while others held that the adoration of the seasons is quite distinct from the damaskāras to the pitrs. In the Saunakatharyanaśrāddha-kalpa, the pindas are offered in the reverse order i. e. first to the great-grand father, then to the grandfather and then to the father (Hemādri on srāddha p. 1442). Āp. Sr. I. 9.4 refers to this method in 'pitamahaprabhrtin Va'.

S, and several sūtras provided that the middle one of tho threo pindas for paternal ancestors was to be eaten by tho wife of the performer of the śrāddha if she was desirous of a son. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that the dharmapatnī (i. e, a wife of the same varpa and married before any other wife ) should eat the middle pipda with the mantra "adhatta pitaro garbham' (9. in n. 780 ) and then she gives birth to a son who lives long, secures fame, is intelligent and obtains woalth and progony and who is of a good and righteous turn of mind. The same rule is provided for by the Laghu-Āśvaliyana 23,83, the Kūrma II. %. 71, 76, Matsya 16,52, Vāyu 76,31, Vispudharmottara I. 171 8, 220. 149, Padma (srstikhanda 9.121) and other purānas. As regards pindas in general, the Asy. Sr. (11. 7. 14-17) says that the other two pindas (except the middle ono ) should be cast into water or in fire or they may be eaten by a brābmana who lias suddenly developed a distaste for food or they may be partaken by one who has been suffering from & serious disease (such as tuberculosis or leprosy) and that in the latter case the man either recovers or dies. The Gobhila-gr. (IV, 3.31-34) provides that the pindas should be thrown into water or in fire or should be given to a brāhmana or a cow to eat, Manu (HII. 260-261 ) says the same and adds that they may be given to a goat for eating and that some allow them to be devoured by birds Yaj. L 257, Matsya 16,52-53, and Padma 1079 mention the same five ways of disposal but the last adds one more viz, placing them near a mound of earth. The Varalla purāpa 1080 ( 190 121 ) says that the performer may eat the first pinda himself, he should give the middle to his wife and the third he should cast into water. The Anuśāsanaparva (125.25.26) provides that the first and the third should be thrown into water or fire and the middle pinda should be eaton by the wife. It is provided by Brhaspati tbat if the wife is suffering from a disease or is already pregnant or is staying in some other

place, then an old bull or a goat may eat the middle pinda (quoted by Sm, C. on Sr. p. 486, Kalpataru on Śr p 224). The Visnudharmottara (L 141, 8) prescribes that when a śrāddha is performed at a tīrtha, the pindas should be cast into the sacred water. The Anuśāsapaparva 125. 38-40 and some of the purāpas such as Vāyu (76 32-34 ) and Brahma (220 150-152) provide that certain consequences follow from the disposal of pindas in one way or another viz. the best worlds by giving piodas to cows, intellect and fame from casting into water, long life from offering them to birds &c. Vide also Brahmanda (upodghāta, chap. 12. 31-35) which provides that if given to cows the result is best complexion, if to cocks then delicacy, Jong life if given crows In this connection it should be noted that pindas of rice or of flour were not to be offered in all śrāddhas. The Sraddha-kalpalatā (pp. 86-89 ) has a long discussion about tho śrāddhas in which the offering of pindas of food is forbidden, For example, it quotes Pulastya to the effect that in śrāddhas parformed on the two ayana days, on the two equinoctial days, on any sankrānti, no pindas are to be offered, so also in sraddhas on Ekādasi, Trayodasi, on Maghā and Krttikā naksatras, if a man desires to have sons and wealth, 

On the question as to what is the principal item in the śrāddha there are three views. Some, like Govindarāja, 1981 hold that feeding of brāhmapas is the principal thing and they rely on Manu III. 129 which says 'One may feed even a single learned brāhmana in a rite for gods and manes and not miany who do not know Yedic mantras; by doing so he reaps abundant reward'. Here the reward or fruit is associated with feeding a learned brāhmapa There is a maxim 1082 of the Pūrvamīmāmsā that whatever is mentioned in proximity with an action that has a reward or fruit but has no special revard of its own, is subsidiary (anga) to what is declared to have a reward.' Besides, there is no pipdadāna in certain śrāddhas such as āmaśrāddha, śrāddha on the Yugādi days 1083

[ Vol. Others like Karka hold the view that piodadana is the principal item in śrāddba. They rely upon the fact that in the śrāddha at Gayā it is the offering of pindas that is the most important matter and upon the fact that in the Visnudharmasūtra (78. 52-53, and 85. 65-66) and in several Puranas such as the Varāha (13.50), Visnu (III. 14,22-23), Brahma (220.31-32), Visnu dharmottara (I 145.3-4) the pitrs are stated to have expressed a deep yearning for a son who would offer them piodas at Gaya and water on sacred rivers &c (vide note 911). Further support is sought for this view in the faot that in the śrāddha on the birth of a son and in srāddha offered even by a good būdra the feeding of brālmanas is forbidden. A third view is that both the feeding of brāhmapas and the offering of pindas are the principal matters in a sraddha, The Gobhila-smrti, after stating 1081 the other two views and some of the reasons therefor, tells us that the author of it is himself in favour of this third view. In cases where the word śrāddba is employed and there 18 neither brāhmana feeding nor pipdadāna as in Daiva śrāddha, the word śrāddha is applied in a secondary sense (gauna). Vide Henādri sraddha) pp. 157-160. In the Dharmapradīpa it is said that among the followers of the Yajurveda (i e. Vājasaneyins) the offering of pindas is principal, among the followers of the Rgveda the feeding of brāhmapas is principal, while among the followers of the Sāmaveda both are principal, In this way śraddha partakes of two characters viz it is a vāga (sacrifice) and also 1085 a gift (dāna) Haradatta, Hemādri, Kapardi and others appear to hold that all three (bhojana pindadāna and agnaukarana) are principal. Vide Samskāra ratnamālā p. 1003. 

The Matsyapurāna says in a famous passaga "ancestors from the fourth (i, e, the father, grand-father and great-grand father of the great-grandfather of performer ) are entitled only to the wipings of the articles of food (sticking to

the hand of the performer of śrāddha); the father, (the grand-father and great-grandfather) are entitled to the pinda; the offerer of the pinda is the 7th; thus sapinda relationship extends to seven generations 1086. The Mārkandeya-purapa states that three ancestors beginning from the paternal grand father of the paternal grandfather epioy the wipings (of the hand of the performer when he offers pindas). 1087 The Brahma purāda (220, 84-86) has similar Verses. Manu provided 1088 that the performer should place three pindas on darbhas and then wipe off from his hand the particles of food and water sticking to it with the roots of the darbhas (on which the pipdas were placed) and that such wipings are meant for those who are called 'lepabhāgin' (the three paternal ancestors after the paternal great-grand-father). Similar provisions are made by the Visnu Dh, S. 73.2%, Varāhapurāna 14,36, Garudapurāna (Ācārakānda 21824), Kūrma II. 22.52. Medhātithi on Manu IIL 216 says that even if no food or water sticks to the hand still the performer rubs ths hand against the roots of the dar bhas on which the first pinda was placed. A. special rule was, provided by Davala quoted in Srāddhakalpalata (p. 14) that if the father or mother became a mleccha (by forcible or yolun tary conversion &c.) one should not observe any impurity for him or her and no śrāddha should be offered and when offering the three pindas in place of the father the name of Vispu should be uttered. 

One question that exercised the minds of well-known writers was whether the daily Varévaceva should be performed before starting the śrāddha ceremonies or after the latter were finished. We have to remember first that several works state that rites for pitrs deserve pre-eminence over those for the

[Vol. gods 1089, Mañu (IL 265 ) states 1090 that after the brāhmavas have been dismissed the performer of sraddha shall offer the (daily) domestic vali offering and that this is the settled rule of dharma, Medhātithi explains that the word "bali' is meroly illustrative. The Matsyapurāna 1091 17 61, the Varāha purāpa (14.43), Skanda VI. 1. 266. 101-102, Devala, Kārsnājini and others provide that after the rites for the fathers are finished Vaiśvadeva should be performed. When Vaiśvadeva is performed after the completion of śrāddha rites, it is to be offered from the food that remains after being utilized for the śrāddha dinner. But Hemādri (pp. 1058-1065) holds a long discussion and arrives at the following conclusions In the case of an āhitāgnz (p. 1064), Vaiśvadora is to be performed before śrāddha except in the case of the śrāddha on the 11th day after death. In the case of one who has not kept the sacred fires there are three optional times for Vaiśvadeva, viz, after agnaukarana or after the vikira (scattering of food on darbhas for those dying without the samskāras being performed for them), or after the brāhmanas are dismissed on the completion of the śrāddha (P 1064), If Vaiśvadeya is to be performed before śrāddha or in the midst of it, then the cooking of food must be done separately for Vaiśvadeva and for śrāddha. In the case of all, whether sāgnika or anagnika, Vaiśvadeva must be performed with the remainder of the food left after use in śrāddha, if the former is performed after the latter, There were sages like Parthinasi1092 that held that Varsvadeva should not be performed with the food cooked for sraddha without first offering the food to the brābmapas invited for śrādda dinner i e, Vaiśvadeva must be performed after śrāddha of the same food is to be used

for the former. The Nirnayasindhu (II. p. 459) states that as most smrtis place the performance of Vaiśvadeya after śrāddha and as many writers of commentaries and digests such as Medhātithi and Smartiratnāvali do the same all should perform Vaiśvadeva after finishing śrāddha, 

It is now necessary to illustrate how pārvana śrāddha is performed in modern times. Here the greatest variety prevails, The details of the rite vary in the different parts of India. They vary also according as the performer belongs to a particular Veda or a particular recension of the Veda, they vary according to the particular eminent writor that is followed and further additions are made according as the performer is a Vaisnaya or a Saiva. Such differences have to be passed over here, particularly because they are not material. We saw above that the Pārvada-śrāddha was very simple in the days of the Brābmanas and most of the sūtras. There was then do express mention of the worship of Viśvedevāh in Paryana śrāddha, or of the maternal ancestors or of the wives of any ancestors. Gradually these came to be added and by the time of the Yāmava]kyasmrti there was special invocation of the Viśvedevāh But these latter were probably not expressly divided into groups at the time of that work, During the smrti parjod groups of Viśvedevāḥ came to be assigned to different kinds of śrāddhas (vide p 457 note 1018). The Puranas pres cribed several Pauranic mantras for being recited during the śrāddha rite, such as the verse "āgacchantu' (note 984) and the verso 'devatābhyah pitrbhyasca' (p. 458 note 1020). Then there arose the principle of the Pūrvamımāmsā that all rites described in the different sākās and sūtras constitute but one rite, and that one may take over from another śākkā or sūtra details described therein, which are not opposed to one's own sākha or sūtra (vide pp 453-55 notes 1011-1013). This principle tended to make the śrāddha rites all inclusive and the whole procedure became swollen to an enormous extent. How even the slightest variation causes difference in the details may be allustrated by an example, In Mitbilā villages even among poor men eleven brāhmadas are invited for pārvada-śrāddha, but it is often difficult to secure a very learned man (who is called pātra or mahāpārra) to officiate, In such a case where a mahāpātra or & pātra brahmapa is not available the śrāddha is called apātraka-pārvadaśrāddha (for which really there is no sastric authority) and is distinguished from the sapātraka pārvana grāddha in several matters, two of which in the case of the

[Vol. 

Vājasaneyins may be stated here. Though the Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana, which is of special authority among Vājagansyias, declares (at the end of kandika III) that the brāhmanas are to be dismissed at the end of the śrāddha with the verse 'Vajo vāje' (Vaj. S 9.18) and the performer should circumambulato the brābmanas with the mantra 'ā mā vājasya' (Vaj S. 9. 19), it is not the practice among the sistas in Mithilā according to the editor of the Srāddharatna to observe these directions in what is called 'apātraka-pārvana-śrāddha' in these days. In Rudradhara's Śrāddhaviveka (pp. 138-146) the "apātraka pārvana-śrāddha-prayoga' is set out at length. 

In medieval and modern times in the different provinces of India different manuals are followed by the followers of the several Vedas. For example, in Bengal the Sāmavedins, Yajurvedins and Rgvedins follow the procedure of pārvada śrāddha laid down in the manuals (or paddhatıs) of Bhavadeya, Pasupati and Kalesi respectively and there are many persons who follow the rules laid down by Raghunandana in his Śrāddhatattva and Yajurvediśrāddha-tattya. In Mithilā, Śridatta wrote his Pitrbhakti for Yazuryedins and the Sraddha kalpa for Sāmayedins and the Srāddha-ratna of Mahānabo pādhyāya Laksmīpati (between 1500 to 1640 A, D ) which is printed at Darbhanga and claims to be the traditional manna) for Maithilas (Maithila-sāmpradāyika-śrāddhapaddhati) in several places says that it follows the Sugatisopāpa of Prati hastaka for Chandogas and also for Vājasaneyins. In tho Madras State Vaisnava brāhmanas follow special troatises on Pūrva and Apara kriyās of Vaidika-Sārvablauma or Harila Venkatācārya or Tolappar and Smārta brābmanas follow tho Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha, which does not much diffor in major matters from the works of Vaidikasāryabhauma, Often the only differences are in the sapkalpa and at the ond It is impossible to exbibit in this work the contents of all those mazuals and to compare and contrast them.

The performer wears white garments (lower and upper) and sits on a seat of kuśas or of wool or deer skin and then sips water twice and wears a paurti a on the finger next to the small finger with Rg, IX, 831.

Then the performer puts into a copper vessel water with the mantra 'imam me Gange' (Rg X, 75, 5), sandalwood paste with the mantra "Gandhadvārām,' yava graing with the mantra 'thou art yaya, king of cereals, Varuna is thy patron, thou art endowed with sweetness, thou art the remover of all sins and art known by all sages as holy', betelnut (with Rg X, 97,15), gold (or some coin) with the mantra ' Hiranya rūpah' (Rg.

X, 9.4) is repeated and also the words *thou art yava, separate from us those who hato us and who are our enemies'. Then apasavyam. The following texts are repeated viz. Rg. X. 9.4. Rg. X. 15.1 and with the maptra The aguras, raksasas, the piśācas, that dwell along the earth are struck down; may they go from this place elsewhere whorever their mind may be fixed', he scatters sesamum grains everywhere and repeats the mantra, Rg. .. 87.1 There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras and twelve Adityas. Let there be protection given by Viapu at the door where sraddha is being performed and may this spot be Gay. The brahmadas reply "Let it be a good spot,' Then savyam. He sprinkles drops of water with darbhas over the food that is cooked for the sraddha dinner with the maptras viz. Rg. IX, 58, 1, IX, 67, 26-28 and with the three Vyahrtis and the Gayatri. Then he requests 'May there be purity of the cooking' and 'miay the sprinkling of the cooked food be accord ing to the rules prescribed,' to which the response is so be it.' Then the verse fagacobantu mahābhāgāh' (vide note 984) is recited and the brābmanas reply "we are carefu) (or atten tive).' Then apasavyam. He announces 'contemplating upon this spot whero sraddha is being performed as Gayā and con centrating the mind on Gadādhara (Vispu) and the pitrs in the form of Vasus and the like, the grāddha (rite) proceeds'. The brāhmabas say 'do proceed.' Then savjam. He gives water on the hand of the darva brahmanas, places on the right side of the seat occupied by them two darbhas together with yavas with his upturned right hand held by the left hand and says with the Vyābrtis (Bhūr, bhuyah, syah) 'this is the seat for the brāhmada representing the Viśys devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava', The brahmapa replies 'byāganam'. This is done also for the second daiva brāhmasa, He then says 'Please sit down here, though art Dharma' and seizing the brāhmeda's hand (ex cept the thumb) he says 'accept the invitation for being daiva brālmana in the Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha.' The rosponse is *so be it.' Then reaching the arghya water, he sprinkles the ground in front of the (daiva) brābmanas with water, spreads two darbhas (in front of each darva brahmana) with their tips towards the east, placas down two vessels with their tops turned downwards, sprinkles water over them with the Gāyatri mantra, raises the vessels up (i. e, turns their tops upwards), again sprinkles water over them and places over them (the two

vessels) two kūrcas 1101 with the tips turned to the east, pours into them water and invokes the water once with the mantra, *san no deyir '(Rg. X. 9. 4). Then he puts yava grains into the two arghya yessels for daiva brābmanas with the mantra 'Yavosi dhānyarāja vā' (note 985 ) and also sandalwood paste, florūers, basil leaf and performs obeisance. He says 'May all the upacaras be completed by means of yavas; the two arghya Tessels for daiva brābmanas are fully ready'. The response is * sogampanne'. He says 'syābā, these are arghya wators'. The response is 'let there be arguya waters'. Placing his left hand in which he holds kuśas and yaya grains on the right knee of the daiva brāhmana and holding in his (right) band yava grains he says 'I shall inpoke the Viśye deyes called Purūrara and Ardraya to be present in you' They respond 'do invoke', He invokes the Visse-devas with the mantra viśve devāsa' (Rg II. 47. 13) separately repeated as regards each daiva brāhmana. He says, 'I invoke the Viśye devas with the mantra 

viśye devāh śroutemām' (Rg. VI. 52. 13 ). Having invoked Vibye devas he casts the remaining yaya grains on the ground near the feet of the daiya brāhmadas. Then he gives water to then (daiva brāhmanas) and he puts in their bands the darbhag placed over the ar ghya vessels; he says 'O Vißve devas called -Purūrava and Ārdrava! this is arghya water for you; svābā, adoration'. They respond 'let there be arghya', Repeating the mantra 'yā divyā āpah' (vide Āśy. Gr. IV.7.13 above in n. 966) he says 'this arghya has been offered, it is no longer mine.' They respond let it be so offered'. The same process is followed as to the second daiva brāhmana. Then he offers fragrant 1102 -substances (sandalwood paste etc.), flowers, basil leaves, incense, lamp, and cash according to his ability as substitute for garment, gopicandang for unguent, sacred chord and two kusa blades for pavitra with the words 'O Viśye deyāh, called Pururaya and Ārdrava! these are fragrant substances for you according

1102. Each of the thiogs is offered with the same formula and as to each there is a response from the brāhmanas with 'su' prefixed to each article affered. It would be like this 'पुलवाद्भवसंज्ञका विश्वेदेवाः यथा भागश: अमी यो गन्धा स्वाहा नमः। सुगन्धाः। पुरू..विश्वेदेवा यधा भागश एष वो दीपः स्वाहा नमः tatge i god so on.

to your portions ; svāhā, adoration'. When offering a garment or cash therefor he recites 'yuyā suyāsaḥ' (Rg. III. 8.4). Then he says " these items viz, gandha, leaves, flowers, incense, lamp ending with covering (garmont) be all of them completa, Let there be good worship in the rite of worship; May that which is wanting or is excessive be according to prescribed rules'. The brāhmanas respond 'astu vidhivat' and the per former recites the verge "I do obeisance to Acyuta by romem bering whom or by uttering whose name whatever is wanting in tapas (observances) or sacrifices becomes at once perfeot', 

Then he says to the pitrya brāhmapas 'with your permis sion I shall offer worship to the pitrs'. They reply 'do offer,' Then apasavyam. After bending his right knee, the performer says 'Bhūr bhuyah syah to Brahman, this is the seat for my father, grandfather and great-grandfather, named N, N., whose gotra is so and so and who are identical with Vasu, Rudra and Aditya'. So saying he offers double-folded darbhas with sesamum grains to the pitrya brāhmadas who reply 'syāsanam'. Then follows the same procedure as regards pitrya brāhmanas which has been already set out as to daiva brāhmanas. The only difference is that instead of two darbhas three darbhas are spread on the ground with their tips towards the south, three vessels are placed towards south-east with faces down wards and three double-folded darbhas are placed on each of the three vessels, instead of "yarosi' the mantra is 'tilogi somadevatyah' (vide note 966) and instead of 'svāhā namaha' the words 'gvadhā namah' are employed, and instead of tulasi leaf bhragarāja leaf is employed. In āvahana the per former places his left hand holding kuśag and sesame on the left knee of the pitrya brahmana and the verge repeated is fusantas tva' (Rg. X. 16. 12) as to each pitrya brahmada and he should hopour the pitrs by repeating one mantra 'a yantu nah' (Vaj. S. 19. 58). He offers arghiya 1103 water with the right hand supported by the left to the father and the other two paternal ancestors. He brings together the sandgravas 1104 in the first pitrya Tessel and anoints his face with that water.if he desires a son. The brāhmanas respond 'may you have a son'.

He places the vessel containing saisravas with the top upside down on darbhas to the north of the daiva vessel, with the mantra 'thou art a place for the pitrs.' Then gandha, flowers with tulasi and bhrngarāja leaves, incense, lamp, garment or cash therefor, gopicandana, sacred chord, betelnut, kusas for pavitra are offered to the pitrs and ho repeats the verse 'idam pitrbhyah' (Rg. X. 15. 2). After repeating the verse "yat smrtya' (vide above) there is 'savyam'. The performer says 'with your permission I shall prepare mandalas and place the plates'. The response is 'do so'. On the spot where the plates for daiva brāhmanas are to be placed a four-cornered mandala beginning from the south-west to north-east and made with the right hand towards it and on the spot for the plates for pitrya brālmadas the mandala is circular beginning from north-east to south-west made with the left hand towards it. Then the plates for the diners are to be placed inside those mandalas, Then taking holy asbes (apasavyam) he draws a line round the plates for pitrya brāhmanas with the mantra 'piśanga-bhristin' (Rg. I. 133, 5). Then savyam. Then round the platos of the darva brahmanas he draws lines with the mantras "raksā no' (Rg. IV. 3. 14). and 'brahma ca' (Rg, X. 4. 7) and two more verses (probably Paurānic) which pray that the mark made with ashes may guard all, just as Visou protects the worlds. Just as Vispu renders ineffective the eyes of all men of evil sight, so one should make a mandala with ashes and when this is done there is no blemish in sitting in the same row for dining. Then the purification of the hand (right) of the brāhmanas is done, beginning with the pitrya brāhmana first, Then tbe performer requests 'let me perform agnaukarana with your permission in the hand 1135 of the (pitrya) brāhmana.' The reply is 'do so'. Then apasavyam. Taking some cooked food and anointing it with clarified butter and dividing it into parts, having touched the two parts placed towards the south he says this for Soma accompanied by the Pitrs, this for Agni, the carrier of kavya ' and having spread the left hand under neath the right hand, having cut off portions from the middle and the part to the east according to the rules for avadanas 1196 

1105 If there are three brāhmanas to represent the three pateraal ancestors, then he should say "in the hands of the brābmanas'. The Nirnayasindhu (III. Uttarardha p. 440) says that a widower performs agnaukarana in the hand of the daiva brābmana.

On the ground near the plates of the Vaiśva deva brāhmapas le scatters food together with yayas and water with the verse 'I shall offer food scattered (vikira) poar the Vaiśvadeva brāhmanas to those gods to whom no soma drink is offered and who are bereft of a share in sacrifices; this scattered food is offered to Visvedevas who do not partake of the some drink; it is not (now) mine'. Then apasaryan He Bays "I shall offer food scattered near ortaya brāhmadas on the ground covered with darbhas to those who died without the samskar as being performed for them and to those womon of my family who left the family (for bad deeds); this scattered food is presented to those boys and girls that oame out of the womb; it is not mine'.

So saying he offers near the pitry& brālmapas a ball of rice and water mixed with sesamum grains. 

Then he Tashes his hands and foot, sips water twice and puts on his finger a partra with the mantra 'payıtravantah' (Rg IX. 73.3). He then requests that the wator in the hands of the daiva brāhnianas be auspicious (or beneficial). The brahmanas reply 'may the waters be auspicious.

Then raising the pranīta 1122vessel the performer requests 'May you say that the water and food and the like offer ed in the Pratisāmvatsarikaśrāddha to pitr, pitāmaha and pra pitamaha, so and so by name and gotra, be inexhaustible.' The pitrya brāhmadas reply 'so be it.' Then savyam. The same request is made to the darva brāhmadas and the reply is the same. Then gold is given to the daiva brāhmaṇas and silver to pitrya brahmanas and the performer says 'may the daksinās (fees) given to the brāhmanas that ate the śrāddha dinner protect (me).' They reply 'may they do so." Then he says "I shall request you to utter the word svadhal' -They reply do so.' Then apasavjam. Then he says "May (the brābmapas representing) father, grand father and great-grandfather utter the word syadhā,' They. reply 'let there be svadba.' Then he should place over the pindas sesamum grains and water. Then he says 'May you declare that svadhā be accomplished.' They reply 'may svadhā be accomplished.' Then savyam. Then he says 'may you say that the gods led by Agni be pleased. They reply 'may the Viśvedevāḥ be pleased.' Then apasavyam. Then he Fequests 'May you declare that the pitrs led by the Vasus be pleased'. They reply 'may the pitrs be pleased.' Savyjum. He says 'May you declare that there is accomplishment of the Bankalpa' (made at the beginning of the rite ). They reply * May there be accomplishment of the sankalpa'. He asks * were the vegetables and cooked food liked by the pitrs'. They reply they were most excellent'. Then the performer deck's himself by applying sandal paste to his forehead. After doing obeisance to the pindas he requests for blessings for his family (which are the same as those set out above from the Padma purāna on p 45% above) and one more blessing 'May persons beg of us but may we not beg of any one' (vide n. 998). The brahnanas reply in the same words only employing the words 'you'or your' for 'us' or our'. 

He says 'I shall remove the pindas'. They reply 'do remove'. Then he repeats the verses Tad Vispoh' (Rg. I. 22,20 ), Tad viprāso' (Rg. I 22.21 ) and two more verses and then a Paurabic verse enumerating the seven holy cities of Ayodhyā, Mathurā, Māyā, Kāśī, Kāñci, Avantika and Dvārakā. He says "May there be peace, prosperity and contentment on the spot where the pindas are'. They reply 'these (peace &c) dwell in their own places'. He says 'I shall

[Vol. remove the plates in which the brāhmanas had their dinner.' Then he lays aside the kurca. He then recites the perse "Vāze vāje' (Rg. VII, 38,8). Then savyam. Then he says 

O pitrs, get up together with the devas' and repeats the verses'ā mā vājasya '(Vaj. 8. 9. 19), svādusamsadah' (Rg. VI. 75 9 ), 'brāhmavāsah pitarah' (Rg. VI 75. 10), ihaiva stam' (Rg. X. 85. 42). Then he recites 'may the grand fathers being pleased grant to men ( their descendants) Jong life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, moksa, happiness and kingdom' (Yā). 1. 270, but reads 'Frayaochantu' for 'prayac olianti'). Then he prays "May these blessings turn out to be true, may my family prosper, may this Pratisā.nyatsarika śrāddha have the same fruits as that of a srāddha performed at Gayāl May the pitra secure inexhaustible gratification,' Then he proceeds Today my birth has had its reward by bowing to your feet &c.' (vide n. 999 for the two verses repeated here). The brāhmanas reply we forget the trouble and excuse you.' Then be says 'Today this tithe is like a day sacred to the sun, the brālmanas invited are like Vyāsa, Vasistha and Vāmadova; may you declare that whatever is lacking as regards seats, dinner, mantras, procedure, materials and fees in this prati samvatsarika sraddha of my pitrs performed by me today bem come all perfect at the words of brāhmanas'. They reply "May all be perfect'. Then he recites the two verses "Vasist hāsah pitryad' and 'devān vasistho' (Rg X 66. 14-15) and then at the end he repeats the verse containing a salutation (the word 'namah') viz "zdam pitrbhyo namo astvadya' (Rg. X. 15. 2). Therefore at the end (of a śrāddha rite) one does obeisance to the pitrs (in the words 'namo val pitaro &c '). Therefore they say "should one repeat the pitryā verses with ahāya mantra specially recited with each verse or without ropeating the āhāva mantra separately with each verso, for it is better not to finish Pitryajña quiokly. He who separately recites the ahāva with each verse makes the pittyajsia that 19 imperfect, complete and therefore one must recite specially employing the āhāva with each verse, "1123 The conclusion is

one should repeat each verse with āhāva separately uttered. The performer should follow the brahmanas up to the boundary of the village). He says 'whatever blemish there may be in japa, tapas or śrāddha ritem may all that become free from blemish by the favour of brāhmanas. I do adora tion to that Acyuta (Visnu) by remembering whom &c. 0 best of brāhmadasl may this śrāddha, even if devoid of mantras, or of some rite or of faith, become perfect by your favour. Then he concludes May Janārdana Vasudeva who assumes the forms of father, grand-father and great-grand father be pleased by this sacrifice, viz. the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of the pitrs This is a sacrifice to the manes. Tat sat. May it be dedicated to Brahma,' Then he repeats the verse * Vasat te (Rg. VII, 99 7) and then says 'adoration to Visnu (Visdave namaḥ) thrice and sips water twice. The fruit of offering pizdas is stated by Brhaspati and Vrddha-Parāgara as follows: If the pitrs are in the wor]d of gods they are grati fied by the food offered in fire, if they are in the world of pitrs they are gratified by the dinner to brāhmanas and if in hell they are gratified by the balls offered on the ground.1123a 

Comparing the above rather elaborate and exhaustive procedure with the procedure of pratisāmvatsarikaśrāddha as 

(Continued froin tite last page) verse' devānim patnīt' (Rg V. 46 6 ) or the rk verse referring to Rākā should be recited first in the आनिमारुतशस्त्र in तृतीयसवन. The conclusion reached is that the verse referring to ye its should be recited first by the 

. In the same context a question is raised whether the Yami verse (Rg X 14 4 'Imam yama prastaram') or the Pitryā verses (Rg. X 15 1-3) should be recited first. The conclusion is that the verse should be first recited, then the Kavya verse (Rg X. 14, 3 "Mātali kavyair') and then the pitrya verses, out of which Rg X. 15, 2 ( TUTXUT FTAT FU) is recited last in which the word नम. occurs, आहाव means the mantra शॉरसावोरम्. The figure 3 is a sign of the Et accept. The sign of a shows deliberation NIE We have to understand awach as the subject Then comes the question whether the 31TETT should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitrgā verses or not The conclusion is that the ITETE should be recited at the begigning of each of the three pitryā verses Apparently it is rather difficolt to say why this passage of the datateor should occur in tbis sreta The only reason appears to be that the dot. passage has something to say about fogs and hence as this is a spalat for rugs it ts introduced here

A, passage occur therein, but the verses in praise of the dust of brābmana's feet do occur. Most of the mantras both Vedic and Paurānio are the same. The blessings (aśir Yādas) in the Madras manual are more elaborate and include even the performer's cattle in the blessing of health and long life. In the Madras manual several mantras are set out as

The procedure for Yajurveding of the Madhyandina Sākba in Bengal as set out by Raghunandana in his Yajurvedi-sti ddhatattva is entirely based on the 2nd and 3rd kapdikās of the Sraddha-sutra of Katyayana. The Pārpanaśraddhā-prayoga in Halāyudha's Brāhmanasaryasya closely follors Kātyāyana and I am assured by a careful student of Dharmasastra that the pro cedure of pārvanaśrāddha followed by Madhyardinas at Bhat para in Western Bengal is in strict conformity with the proce dure laid down by Raglunandana, The Sraddhasūtra of Kātyāyana is translated here with some explanations and additions made by Halāyudha and Raghunandana and the whole text, being not very extensive, is giren in the note below 1124

"The parvana-sraddha is preceded by the rite for Visve devas. The procedure follows that of Pindapitryajña 1124a. In the rites for the pitrs double-folded darbhas are to be used (while in Vaiśvadevika rite straight darbbas are used). Whenever any thing is to be gifted, the performer (in all daiva as well as pitrya rites ) wears a pavitra and makes the gift sitting. (When questions are to be asked) the performer puts the question to the most eminent in the row of diners (to the best daiva brāhmana in daive rites and to the best pitrya brāhmana in pitrya rites) or he may put the question to all (and the reply is given by one or by all) Spreading darbhas on the seats (he makes the brāhmapas occupy them), he puts the question 'shall I invoke the Visvedevas (to the daiva brahmana)'. Being permitted (by the daiva brahmanas) in the words 'do invoke', he javokes the Vośredevas with the mantra 1125 'Viśre devāsa agata' (Vaj. S. 7.34 'Ye All Gods, come, listen to this my call and sit down on this darbha grass '). Then he scatters yavas (in front of the brahmanas), mutters a mantra 'Visvedevah srunutemam' (Vaj. S. 33. 53, 'Ye All Gods, hear this call of mine'). After this gapa he asks (the pitrya brāhmanas) 'I shall invoke the pitrs'. When permitted (by the pitrya brāh manas) in the words 'do invoke', he invokes them with the mantra 'usantas tva.' (Vaj. S. 19. 70, 'O Agni! we longing for our fathers place you down' &c.). Then he scatters (sesamum

S. 36. 12, 'May the divine waters be for our happi ness' &c.). (He puts yavas in the vessel for daiva rite). He puts in each of the cups sogamum grains with the mantra 'Thou art Tila 1126 &c.'. He offers on the hands of each of the brāhmanas (first daiva and then pitrya) that wear a payitra water in a vessel made of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or precious stone or in whatever vessels may be available or in vessels made of bunches of leaves with the mantra 'yā divyā 1127 āpah &c.'. The water is offered in the words 'O father' N, N. by name, this is arghya for you' (and then to other ancestors ).

Having taken out in another vessel some food from out of the food already cooked for srāddha and having anointed it with ghee he (the performer) asks "I shall perform agnan Tarana'. Being permitted by the brāhmapas in the words do so', he offers into (grhya) fire oblations 1130 as in Ploda

The Sraddhastra of Katyāyana pitryajña, having served (into all the plates for all the brāh manas invited) the food that remains after being offered in fire, he touches with his hands (above and below each plate) and repeats the mantra "The earth is thy yessel &c.' (notes 99%, 1108a). (He keeps some food aside for making pindas later on), Then (having served the food in the plates) he plunges the thumb of the brahmanas in the food with a rk (Rg. I. 22, 17, 'idam Vignur vicakrame') addressed to Vispu or with a Yajus so addressed ("Visno kavyamidam raksasya'). Then he scat tors about (yavas before daiva brābmabas silently and) sesa mum grains with the mantra 'apahatā asurā raksansi vedi sadah' (Vāj. S. 2. 29). Then he should serve hot food very much liked (by diners or by the departed) or he may serve such food as he can afford. While the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating (the dinner) he should perform japa of the follow ing 1131, viz, the sacred Gayatri once or thrice preceded by om and the vyāhrtis, the verses called Rāksoghni (note 1111 ), mantras addressed to the pitrs (Rg. X. 15, 1-23 beginning with Sudiratām-avara ut parāsah)', Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 1-16), Apratiratha hymn (Rg. X. 103. 1–13 ) beginning with 'aśuh śiśānah') and other holy texts. Then finding that the brāh mapas are satiated with food, he should scatter some food in front of the dining brahmanas, he sbould give to each brāb mana water once (for apośana at the end of dinner). Then he should mutter as before the Gāyatri, the (three) Madhumati verses (Rg. I. 90 6-8) and the word 'madhu' (thrice). Then he asks are you satiated'. Being permitted by them in the words 'we are satiated', he makes them give their consent as to the rest of the food, collects together all food in one vessel (in order to make pindas from it); he offers (two sets of three pindas, three for paternal ancestors and three for maternal ancestors) on darbhas near the spot where 1132 the brāhmanas dined and left uneaten food in plates and pours water over the pindas for ablution 1133 Some authors say that pindas are to

Then he prays for the following blessings. He prays 'may the pitrs be not terrible (i. e, be kind) to us'. The brāhinanas reply 'may they be so'He prays 'May our family prosper'. They reply 

may it be so'. He prays ‘May donors increase in our family'. They reply 'let it ba so'. He prays "May Vedas and our pro geny prosper'. The reply is 'May they do 80°, He says "May faith not depart from me'; they say "May it not depart'. He says 'May we possess many things that we can donate'. They reply .so be it'. After receiving these blessings he spreads kusas called svadhāvācaniya 1134a together with pavitras (on the ground near the pipdas or, on the pindas themselves according to Devayājõika and others); he asks (all the brāli manas or the most eminent one) 'shall I request you to utter the word svadha'. Being permitted by them in the words 'May svadbā be recited' he prays "May there be svadhū to the pitrs, to the grandfathers, to the great-grand-fathers, to the maternal grandfather, maternal great-grandfather and maternal great great-grandfather'. When the brāhmadas reply "May there be svadha' he sprinkles water over the svadhāyācaniya darbhas with the mantra 'ārjam Vahaptir' (Vā; S. II. 34). Then he turns the vessel top upwards (which had been placed with top downwards) and he should give to the brāhmanas daksina according to his ability. He should make the daiva brābmanas repeat May all the gods be pleased'. He should then dismiss the brābnanas with the mantra 'Vaje vāje' (Vaj. S 9. 18), he should follow the brāhmanas (up to the village boundary) with the mantra kā mā vājasya' (Vāj S. 9. 19), circumambulate them and then enter his oyn house.

It is to be noted that in the Bengal Manual of Pārvana śrāddha based on the Brahmanasarvasva of Halāyudha and also on Raghunandana's Yajurvedi-śrāddhatattva the following details are added after the pindas are placed on the darbhas and before the dismissal of the brāhmadas, He turns towards the north and says 'O pitrs, regale yourselves here and come like bulls each to his portion,' Then he turns round to his former position and says *the pitrs regaled themselves and came like bulls each to his own share.' Then he loosens 1135 the side of his dhoti which has been tucked up and then folds up his hands (i.e, offers six namaskāras) with the mantra 1136 'Namo vah pitaro rasāya' (Vāj. S. II, 32). He smells 1137 the pipdas and gives the middle one to his wife, if she desires a son, with the mantra 'ādhatta' 

(Vāj. S II. 33), 

From considerations of space the procedure of pārvana śrāddha among Hiranyakeśins in modern times is passed over here. Moreover, it closely resembles the procedure in Āśv, Gr. get out above, the principal difference being that some of the mantras are different. The 'Samskāraratnamālā of Gopinātha deals with this from p. 985 onwards But one noticeable feature of this last york is that of making hajr-splitting distinctions, On p. 985 it refers to two śrāddhas (other than pinda-pitr yajña) to be performed on amārāsyā, viz, mās-śrāddha and mastha-śrāddha, the first being described by the Dharmasūtra of Hirapyakeśin and the second by the Grhyasūtra. Gopinatha further says that māsikaśraddha is the model of the other śrāddhas described in the Gilyasutra and māsjśrāddha is the model of śrāddhas described in the Dharmaśāstras, such as Mahālayaśrāddha or Samvatsarika-śrāddha, that Darśaśraddha itself is māsi-śrāddha (p. 988) and that māsika-śraddha may be performed on each dar sa or on any one darśa day in a year and that māsi-śrāddha follows immediately after Pindapitryajña as

(Vol. laid down by Manu (III. 122) and māsikaśrāddha may be per formed after masi-śrāddha. In modern times no one performs māsitrāddha or māsika-śrāddha strictly in accordance with the ancient rules. Srāddha is supposed to be performed by feeding a brāhmana and giving him a daksidā of a fov annas. The Sraddhatatty& (Jiv., part 1 p. 254) provides, after quoting Matsya and Bhavisya, that, if a person is unable to perform a pāryanaśrāddha every month, he should perform one at least thrice a year when the sun is in the zodiacal signs of Kanya, Kumbha and Vrsabha and that if he is unable to perform even thrice then he should perform at least once when the sun is in the sign of Kanyā. 

The two meanings of sapinda given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga have already been explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and pp. 472–477. The Dāyabhāga pro pounded the theory that whoever conferred greater spiritual benefit on the deceased by the performance of śrāddhas and the offering of pindas was entitled to be preferred as an heir to the deceased's wealth. The Mit. said that heirship depended on blood relationship and the nearest in blood to the deceased vas the preferential heir, But even under the Mit, whoever took. the wealth of the deceased was bound to pay his debts (Ya). II. 51) and to offer śrāddha and pipda to him. This subject and the goveral propositions deduced from the texts have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 734-745. 

One thing to be remembered is that in determining the preferential right regard is to be had to the capacity of a per son and the efficacy of the pindas when offered. Aftor a person takes the vealth of the deceased, there is no legal machinery to enforce his duty to offer pindas 1139 It was argued in Nalinaksha v. Rajanı Kanto 350. W, N. 726 that, if an beir does not offer pindas or refuses to offer them to his ancestor, he was not entitled under Hindu Law to succeed to him. This argument was repelled by the judges with the remark that there was no authority for such a proposition and that the right to inheritance is based under the Dayabbāga not on offoring pinda but on the capacity to offer it (p. 729). Vide Gooroo Gobinda Saha v. Anand Lal 5 Beng. I. R. 15 (F. B.) and Digamber r; Olotilal 9 Cal. 563 (F. B.) for the statement that the principle of spiritual benefit is the sole foundation of the theory of in

IV) The Dayabhāga theory of spirituat benefit 511 heritance propounded in the Dāyabhāga. But in certain later cases such as Akshayachandra v. Hari Das 35 Cal, 721 it was rightly pointed out that spiritual benefit is not always the guiding principle under the Bengal school of law, that the principle of spiritual efficacy as the guiding principJe fails in all classes of female relations such as the wife, the daughter and the mother whose rights are really based on special texts and that the reason for inheritance by a re-united coparcener was not spiritual benefit but was based on a quasi contract and affection. 

The question about how śrāddha was to be performed if one or more of the three paternal ancestors were alive engaged the thoughts of writers from very ancient times. The Āśy, 1139 Śr. S (IL 6. 16-23) first sets out the views of Gāpagāri, Taulvali and Gautama and then refutes them, Gā pagāri held that out of the three paternal ancestors pindas should be offered to those that were dead and those that were alive should be honoured ja person, since the śrāddha rite is meant for pleasing the ancestors; Taulvali opined that pindas should be offered to all the three ancestors, whether living or dead, since in the rite of śrāddha they are only a secondary matter (a detail). Gautama thought that pindas should be offered to dead ancestors, upto three from the father if the latter was living, from the grand father if he was alive and from the great-grandfather if all the three be living. Āśv, replies; one cannot offer pindas to three ancestors 1140 beyond the father, grand-father or great grandfather, since one has no adhikara to do so; one cannot offer pipdas to an ancestor after whom there is an ancestor (within three degrees) living. One may offer homa into fire to those that are alive, (If all three ancestors are alive) all the three pindas must be cast into fire or he may not begin the rite at all. The Katyāyana śr. 1142 sūtra provides

1140 One can offer pindas only to three ancestors beginning with the father according to Vedic passages quoted in notes 958, 9602 above and Manu IX 186. So there is no ancient authority to offer pinda to 4th or 5th or 6tb ascendant.

History of Dharmatāstra . (Vol, that pindas are offered only to deceased ancestors; therefore if a person's father be alive or if there is a deceased ancestor bettroen whom and the performer there is an ancestor that is alive, then one whose father is alive can only perform homa (into fira, but no pindadana ) or he should not undertake at all (tho rite of pinda-pitryajāa or pirvanaśrāddha); that Jātākaroys prescribes that Lo pindadana is possible wlion a living ancestor (father) intervenes between the performier and & deceased abcestor, since a sruti text says 'one does not offer pindas to ancestors that are beyond a living ancestor.' Madu (II. 220-222 ) deals with this question as follotys: If the performer's father be alire he should offer pindas to three ancestors begio ning from the paternal grand-father or he may request the father to dinner as he would do to a stranger brābmana and offer pindas to the deceased grand-father and great-grand-father, I the father be dead and the grandfather be alive, he may offer a pinda only to the father and the great-grandfather (i.e only two pindas) or the grand father who is alire may be izrited to dinner as if he rere the stranger brāhmada invited to represent & deceased grand-father or if permitted by the grandfather who is alire he may offer pindas to father, great-grandfather and great great-grandfather. The Viṣoudharnasūtra (chap. 75) has several rules of & similar character. Some of the Puranas such as Skanda VT 225,21-25, Agni 117.58-59 deal with this matter, Gobhilasmrti (IT. 93 f) has a long passage on this question, one Terse of which is quoted belos, 1142 Many of the commentaries and digests hold dirergent Tiets on this subject, riz, the Mit. on Yaj. I. 254, Kalpataru (śr, pp 210 ff), ST, K. K. pp. 552-556 and Nirpayasindhu (III, pp. 499-503 ). It is impossible to reconcile all the views, The Kalpataru (on śr. p. 240) states that there are thras a}ternative courses for him whose father is alivo, (1) he should pass over the father that is alive and offer pindas $0 those tree ancostors to whom his father offers pindas; (Manu. LIT, 220, Visṇu Dh, S 75,1); (2) he should simply offer hona into fira as stated in Āśr. Śr, S. quoted above, (3) he shonld not engage in the rite of pindapitryajia or pārvapaśrāddha at all (Gobhila-sarti IL 93). The Nirnaya sindhu says that there are numerous alternatires mentioned by different writers, that they are forbidden in the Kali age and 1142. . Ragarig F rade it operarii parang ganana

that one viow is that a man whose father is alive cannot engage in a pārvapaśraddha and that the real conclusion is that śrāddha may be offered to those to whom the father (of the performer ) who is living offers pivdas. It is clear that one whose father is living should have nothing to do with pindadāna for deceased ancestors. Manu (in latter half of III. 220) allowed an alternative viz. one should feed one's father at a dinner (and honour him with the details of worship such as gandha, dhūpa, dipa) and offer pindas to the deceased grandfather and great-grandfather. When any one or two out of the three paternal ancestors are alive and śrāddha is permitted to a descendant several alternatives become possible by parnu tation and combination, which are passed over here from considerations of space and utility. But the various views held by different writers as described above show clearly what a firm grip the theory of the supreme benefits to be derived from śrāddhas bad on the minds not only of common people but of learned men, who, in spite of the fact that the father was alive and was there to offer pindas to his three ancestors, allowed even the son (whose father was living) to offer pindas to the same three ancestors, The Visnu Dh. S, extends the procedure about 'Jfyatpitrka' to one's mother's paternal ancestors (changing the mantra where necessary ). 1142. Similar rules apply where the performer's mother is alive (Agnipurāna 117.60 ‘evam mātrādikasyāpı tathā mātāmahādike'). 

It is provided by Gobhilasmrti (IL 157 ) that a śruti injunc tion should be made effective by means of anukalpa (of some substituted procedure) if the primary procedure cannot be carried out 1143 If a person cannot secure several brāhmanas but can secure only one, he should perform Pārvapa-stāddha in which six pindas are to be offered with a single brāhmana, pro vided he is pankti-pāvana 1144 (sanctifier of a row of diners) and in such a case, nariedya should be offered in place of the dinner

History of Dharmasastra to the daiva brāhmanas and the food should be thrown into fire; So says Saṅkha 14.10. If even a single brahmana cannot be had for a pārvapaśrāddha, then one should prepare with kuśas the effigy of brābmapa students (batu) and the performer should himself ask the questions and give the answers required in parvanasraddha.1145 

When one cannot secure a brāhmana nor materials, or when one is on a journey, or on the birth of a son, or when one's wife is in her monthly illness, one may perform āmaśrāddha (śrāddha with uncooked grains). 1146 This is stated by the Skandapurāna VII. 1. 206, 52. Kātyāyana and Sauraparāda 19.32 have similar verses 'a twice-born person should perform āmaśrāddha when he is on a journey or is in distress, or if he has no fire for cooking and those who are weak may always perform it.' The Madanaparijata (p. 483) states that one who has the adhıkāra for pārvanaśrāddha can alone offer āmaśrāddha. Harita says that when there is an obstacle in performing a śrāddha, āmaśrāddha is prescribed except in the case of māsika and samvatsarika śrāddhas, 2147 Amaśrāddha is always pres cribed for sūdras. It was further provided that the grains offered 

in srāddba should be utilized by the brahmanas for eating the s cooked food for themselves and were to be applied for no other 

purpose (Hemadri, Sr. p. 1527). Vyasa provides 1148 that the quantity of grains should be at least two or three or four tinies as much as the grains required for offering cooked food. Some words employed in the various items such as āvāhana 1149

Amasrāddha is to be performed in the first part of the day, ekoddista in the noon, the pārvanaśrāddha in the afternoon and yrddhiśrāddha in the first part of the day (divided into 

five ), 1149a 

If even uncooked food grains cannot be offered the per forner should perform hemaśrāddha (śrāddha with money) When the sun passes from one sign of the zodiac into another, in default of food and brahmanas, on a journey, on the birth of a son, in an eclipse, in the case of women and śūdras hema śrāddha is allowed or when one's wife is in her montbly illness, In āmaśrāddha twice the quantity of grains required in offering cooked food and in hemaśrāddha four times (the price of the grains required for cooked food) has to be offered. If no money can be had the digests prescribe several nodes which have already been set out above ( vide p 425, n. 955 ).
