ŚRĀDDHA

This subject is of great practical importance from several points of view.

## Definition of śrāddha

The Brahmapurāṇa defines śrāddha as follows: 'whatever is given with faith to brāhmaṇas intending it to be for the (benefit of) _pitṛs_ at a proper time, in a proper place, to deserving persons and in accordance with the prescribed procedure is called śrāddha[^751]. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 217 defines śrāddha as 'abandonment with faith of an article of food or some substitute thereof, intending it for (the benefit of) the departed'. The Kalpataru on śrāddha defined it as 'the giving up of sacrificial material intending it for _pitṛs_ and its acceptance by brāhmaṇas'. The Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara and the Śrāddhaprakāśa define śrāddha in the same way as the Mit, but in a more involved manner. Yaj. I. 268 (= Agnipurāṇa 163. 40-41) states that the _pitṛs_ viz. Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas that are the deities of śrāddha, being gratified by śrāddha, give gratification to the ancestors of human beings. This verse and Manu III. 284 make it clear that the three ancestors of a man, viz, the father, paternal grand-father and the paternal great grand-father are respectively to be identified with the three orders of superintending _pitṛ_ deities, viz. Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas, when performing śrāddha. According to some[^752], śrāddha denotes three things, viz. _homa_, the offering of _piṇḍa_ (ball of cooked food) and gratification of brāhmaṇas invited to a dinner; the application of this word to any one of these three can only be in a secondary sense.

The दीपकलिका on या. I. 218 accepts कल्पतरु : श्राद्धं नाम वेदबोधितपात्रालम्भनपूर्वक प्रमीतपित्रादिदेवतोद्दशको द्रव्यत्यागविशेषः। श्राद्धविवेक p. 1; अत्रापस्तम्बादिसकलवचन पर्यालोचनया प्रमीतमात्रोद्देश्यकान्नत्यागविशेषस्य ब्राह्मणाद्याधिकरणप्रतिपत्त्यङ्गकस्य श्राद्ध पदार्थत्वं प्रतीयते । श्रा.प्र.p. 4. The श्राद्धविवेक states that द्रव्यत्याग is enjoined by the words of the Veda (वेदबोधित) and the thing abandoned is handed over to a deserving brāhmaṇa ( पात्रालम्भनपूर्वक ). प्रतिपत्ति in श्रा. प्र. means the final disposal of a thing used in a sacrifice e. g. in Darsa-pürnamāsa we have the sentence सह शाखया प्रस्तरं प्रहरति. Here शाखाप्रहरण is प्रतिपत्तिकर्म (Jai. IV. 2.10-13) and not अर्थकर्म : similarly, the cremation of an ahitagni with his sacrificial vessels is a प्रतिपत्तिकर्म so far as the यज्ञपात्रs are concerned.

[^752]: होमश्च पिण्डदानं च तथा ब्राह्मणतर्पणम्। श्राद्धशब्दाभिधेयं स्यादेकस्मिन्नोपचारिकः॥q. by श्राद्धसार p 30. हरदत्त on आप.ध. सू. II. 7. 16.2 says the same thing. श्रीदत्त in पितृभक्ति (folio 23a) says 'पिण्डदानं तु न श्राद्धं किं तु श्राद्धाङ्गं पिण्डविरहेपि निस्यश्राद्धदर्शनात्।'.

A firm believer in the doctrine of _karma_, _punarjanma_ (reincarnation) and _karma-vipāka_ (explained above) may find it difficult to reconcile that doctrine with the belief that by offering balls of rice to his three deceased paternal ancestors a man brings gratification to the souls of the latter. According to the doctrine of _punarjanma_ (as very clearly and succinctly put in Br. Up. IV. 4.4 and Bhagavad-gitā 2.22)[^753] the spirit leaving one body enters into another and a new one. But the doctrine of offering balls of rice to three ancestors requires that the spirits of the three ancestors even after the lapse of 50 or 100 years are still capable of enjoying in an ethereal body the flavour or essence of the rice balls wafted by the wind. Further, Yāj. I. 269 (which is the same as Mārk. 29. 38, Matsya-purāņa 19. 11-12, Agnipurāṇa 163. 41-42) provides that the grand fathers (i.e. _pitṛs_) being themselves gratified (by the offerings of food in śrāddha) bestow on men (their descendants ) long life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, _mokṣa_ (final beatitude), all happiness and kingdom. In the Matsya-purāņa (chap. 19, verse 2) a question is asked by the sages how food which a brāhmaṇa (invited at a śrāddha) eats or which is offered into fire is enjoyed by departed spirits that might have assumed (after death) good or evil forms of bodies. The answer given ( verses 3-9) is that fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand fathers are identified with Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas respectively according to Vedic passages, that the name and _gotra_ (mentioned at the time of śrāddha), the _mantras_ uttered and faith carry to the _pitṛs_ the offerings made, that if one's father has become a god (by his good deeds) the food offered in śrăddha becomes nectar and follows him in his state of godhood, if he has become a _daitya_ (an asura) then (the food) reaches him in the form of various enjoyments, if he has become a beast then it becomes grass for him and if he has become a snake the śrāddha food waits on him as wind (serpents are supposed to subsist on wind) and so on.

Verses 5-9 of the Matsya, chap. 19 are quoted as from Mārkandeyapurāṇa by the Srāddhakalpalata p. 5. Visvarūpa[^754] on Yaj. I. 265 (p. 171 of Tri, ed.) also raises the same objection and gives several replies. One is that this is a matter entirely based on _śāstra_ and so when sāstra says that _pitṛs_ are gratified and the performer gets desired objects no objection should be raised. Another reply is that the gods Vasus and others that have access everywhere have the power to gratify pitṛs wherever they may be situated. He does not call the questioners (_nāstika_) as some other and later writers do.

The Śrāddhakalpalata of Nandapaṇḍita[^755] (about 1600 A. D.) enters upon an elaborate reply to these persons (whom he dubs atheists) that aver that the performance of śrāddhas for departed fathers and the rest, who according to the particular actions of each go to heaven or hell or to other forms of existence serves no purpose. He asks: why is śrāddha useless? Is it because there is no prescriptive text laying down an obligation to perform it or is it because śrāddha produces no consequences or is it that it is not proved that _pitṛs_ and the rest are gratified by śrāddha? To the first he replies that there are such passages as 'therefore a wise man must perform śrāddha with all his efforts that lay down the obligation; nor is the 2nd objection proper, since Yāj. I. 269 does declare the rewards (of śrāddha ) viz, long life &c. Nor is the third alternative acceptable. In the śrāddha rites it is not that the mere ancestors named Devadatta and the like are the recipients and that they are denoted by the words pitṛ, pitāmaha and prapitāmaha, but that those words denote them as accompanied by the superintending deities viz. Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas. Just as by the words Devadatta and the like what is denoted is not merely the bodies ( so named) nor merely the souls, but what is denoted by the words is individual souls as particularised by the bodies; in the same way the words _pitṛ_ and the like denote Devadatta and others together with the superintending deities (viz. Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas). Therefore, the superintending deities viz, the Vasus and the rest, being gratified by the food and drink offered by the sons and the rest, gratify those also viz. Devadatta and the rest and endow the performers (of śrāddha ) with such rewards as male progeny and the rest. Just as a woman expecting to be a mother becomes gratified by partaking of the food and drink for which she has a longing in pregnancy and which is given to her by another person for the sustenance of the child in the womb, she satiates also the child in her womb and endows those that offer her the food and drink for which she has longings by bestowing on them some reward in return. Thus the _pitṛs_ denoted by the words father, grandfather and great-grand-father are the deities Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas, and not merely (human beings called ) Devadatta and the rest. Hence these deities of śrāddha become the recipients (of gifts) in the śrāddha rite, are gratified by the śrāddha and gratify in their turn the ancestors of human beings.

The passage from न ह्यात्र देवदत्तादयः up to the end is taken almost verbatim from the Mit. on Yaj. I. 268. The श्राद्धतत्व p.191 remarks 'वसरुद्रादितिसुता:इति एतद्वचनं तु तदाकारत्वेन भावनापरमिति श्राद्धविवेकादय:।'.

## Does śrāddha serve no purpose

The Śrāddha-kalpalatā then quotes 18 verses[^756] from the Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa many of which are found in chap. 28 ( verses 3 ff) of the printed text. It is said[^757] that just as a calf finds its own mother from among many cows that are scattered about, so the mantras repeated in śrāddha carry the food to the pitṛs.

The explanation offered by the Śrāddha-kalpalatā relying on passages of the Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa is not satisfactory and is rather far-fetched. The Mārkaṇḍeya and the Matsya appear to agree with the doctrine of Vedānta that immediately on leaving one body the soul has recourse to another body, either as a god or a man or a beast or a snake &c. The hypothesis propounded is that the food and drink offered in šrāddhas becomes transformed into various substances for the use of the ancestors (Matsya 141. 74–75). But the great difficulty in accepting this explanation is that the ancestors might die at different places, while śrāddha may very often be performed at one place far away from those places. It is difficult to believe that the grass growing in one place where the ancestor has been transformed into a beast as a result of his evil actions is the same that might have been produced from the substances offered in śrāddha at a place hundreds of miles away. Further, if one or all the three ancestors have been transformed into beasts or the like how can they recognize their offspring and bestow on them long life, wealth &c? If the Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas bestow these, it is better to say so directly and affirm that _pitṛs_ cannot bestow any thing on their progeny.

## Theory of Śrāddha examined

It appears very probable that the worship of ancestors by means of śrāddhas was a very ancient institution and that the doctrines of _punarjanma_ and _karmavipāka_ were comparatively later ones and that Hinduism being all-embracing retained the institution of śrāddhas while adopting also the doctrine of metempsychosis. The institution of śrāddha is from one point of view an excellent one. It provides an occasion for remembrance of one's ancestors and relatives that were dear and near when living. The Āryasamāja objects to the institution of śrāddha and interprets pitṛs in the Ṛgveda as meaning living men in the Vānaprastha stage. It may be noted that the texts support both views. The Šat. Br. expressly says that food is offered to the father of the sacrificer in the words 'this is for thee.' Viṣṇu Dh. S. 75. 4 "He whose father is dead may put down a piṇḍa for his father &c". On the other hand Manu III, 284 states that fathers are spoken of as Vasus, grandfathers as Rudras &c. and Yāj. I. 269 provides that Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas are the pitṛs and the devatās of śrāddha. These latter are to be explained as containing an injunction to contemplate upon the pitṛs as Vasus, Rudras &c.

As stated below (p. 347) with regard to the Ṛgvedic passages, it was on account of the supposed power of pitṛs to benefit or harm the living that the cult of the dead became a prominent feature in primitive societies. Offerings and ceremonies which may have in most ancient times been prompted in part at least by the desire to placate the ancestors are continued as tokens of pure affection and remembrance. Various beliefs about pitṛs are mentioned[^758] in post-Vedic Literature. The Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 14 summarizes a brāhmaṇa text stating that pitṛs move about in the form of birds. The Aušanasa-smṛti and Devala quoted by the Kalpataru say the same thing.

[^758]: वयसां पिण्डं दद्यात् । वयसां हि पितरः प्रतिमया चरन्तीति विज्ञायते । बौ.ध. सू. II.8.14; न च पश्येत काकादीन् पक्षिणस्तु न वारयेत् । तद्रूपाः पितरस्तत्र समायान्ति बुभुत्सवः॥ औशनस (Jiv. I. p. 531); न चात्र श्येनकाकादीन् पक्षिणः प्रतिषेधयेत् । तद्रूपाः पितरस्तत्र समायान्तीति वैदिकम् ॥ देवल q. by कल्पतरु on श्राद्ध p. 17.


In the Vāyupurāṇa[^759] it is stated that at the time of śrāddha the ancestors enter the brāhmaṇas (invited) after assuming an aerial form and that when the best of brāhmaṇas are honoured with clothes, foods, gifts, eatables, liquids, cows, horses and villages, pitṛs become pleased. Manu III. 189 and the Aušanasa-smṛti also support this notion that pitṛs enter the invited brāhmaṇas. The Matsyapurāṇa (18. 5-7 ) enjoins: piṇḍas should be offered to the departed for twelve days after death, since they serve hin as food on his journey and give him great satisfaction. Therefore, the soul leaving the dead body is not taken to the abode of the departed for twelve days after death); the departed spirit hovers near his house, his sons, his wife for twelve days. Therefore for ten days after death milk (and water) should be placed (hung up) in space for ten nights for reducing all torments (or troubles of the departed) and for the removal of the fatigue of the journey (that the departed spirit has to make ). The Viṣṇudharmasūtra[^760] (20.34-36 ) provides “the departed spirit enjoys in the world of _pitṛs_ the food offered in śrāddha with the utterance of the word 'svadhā'; whether the departed is in the state of a god or in the place of torments (Hell) or in the form of a lower animal or a human being, the śrāddha food offered by his relatives reaches him; when śrāddha is performed, the performer and the departed soul both certainly secure vigour (or prosperity ).”

The Brahmapurāņa[^761] states that śrāddha is to be treated of under five heads, viz. how, where, when, by whom and with what materials. But before proceeding to deal with these five heads, it is necessary to dilate upon the underlying ideas and significance of the word '_pitaraḥ_' from the most ancient times of which we have literary records.

759. श्राद्धकाले तु सततं वायुभूताः पितामहाः । आविशन्ति द्विजान् दृष्ट्वा तस्मादेतद् ब्रवीमि ते ॥ वस्त्रैरन्नैः प्रदानैस्तैर्भक्ष्यपेयैस्तथैव च । गोभिरश्वैस्तथा ग्रामैः पूजयित्वा द्विजोत्तमान् । भवन्ति पितरः प्रीताः पूजितेषु द्विजातिषु॥ तस्मादन्नेन विधिवत् पूजयेद् द्विजसत्तमान् । वायुपुराण 75.13-15 (= वायु, उत्तरार्ध 13.13-15, Venk. ed.); ब्राह्मणास्ते समायान्ति पितरो ह्यन्तरिक्षगा। वायुभूताश्च तिष्ठन्ति भुक्त्वा यान्ति परां गतिम् । औशनसस्मृति 10. I, p.526).

## Meaning of 'Pitaraḥ'

The word '_pitṛ_' means 'father', but the word 'pitaraḥ' is used in two senses, viz. (1) a man's three immediate deceased ancestors, (2) the early or ancient ancestors of the human race that were supposed to inhabit a separate world (_loka_) by themselves[^762]. For this second meaning, vide Ṛg. X. 14. 2 and 7, X 15.2 (translated above pp. 191-92, 194) and Ṛg. IX.97.39[^762a]. "That Soma which becomes stronger and stronger and makes others strong, that is strained through a strainer, that flows in a stream, protected us by means of the luminary (the Sun)--that Soma with whose help our ancestors knowing the place where the cows were kept concealed) and the higher regions, harassed the mountain for the sake of recovering) the cows.' In Ṛg. X. 15.1 the pitṛs are said to be of three grades, lower, middling or higher. They are also said to be earlier and later ones (Ṛg. X. 15.2). They are all known to Agni, though all _pitṛs_ are not known to their descendants (Ṛg. X. 15. 13). The _pitṛs_ are divided into several groups such as Aṅgirasas, Vairūpas, Atharvans, Bhṛgus, Navagvas and Daśagvas (Ṛg. X. 14,5-6), the Angirasas being particularly associated with Yama who is invoked to come to the sacrifice along with the Angirasas (Ṛg. X. 14. 3-5). In Ṛg. I.[^763] 62. 2 it is said: 'through whose (Indra's) help our ancient ancestors (_pitaraḥ_), the Aṅgirasas, who sang his praises and who knew the place, found out the cows.' The pitṛs called Angiras were, it appears, again subdivided into two classes viz. Navagva and Daśagya[^764] both of which words occur in Ṛg. 1. 62 4, V. 39. 12 and X. 62. 6. In several passages the ancient fathers are identified with the seven sages[^765] as in Ṛg. IV. 42.8 and VI. 22.2 and sometimes the Navagvas and Daśagvas also are said to be the geven sages (Ṛg. I. 62.4). Angirasas are said to be the song of Agni (Ṛg. X. 62, 5) and also of Heaven (Ṛg. IV. 2. 15). The _pitṛs_ are often said to regale themselves in the company of gods, particularly of Yama (Ṛg. VII. 76, 4, X, 14, 10, X, 15, 8-10)[^766]. The _pitṛs_ are said to be fond of Soma drink (Ṛg. X. 15. 1 and 5, IX. 97. 39), they lie down on kuśa grass (Ṛg. X. 15.5), they come with Agni and Indra to partake of the offerings (Ṛg. X. 15. 10 and X. 16.12) and Agni is also said to carry the offerings to the _pitṛs_ (Ṛg. X. 15.12). Fire is supposed to take the spirit of a cremated person to the _pitṛs_ (Ṛg. X. 16. 1-2, 5=A, V. 18. 2. 10; Ṛg. X, 17, 3). In later works also (e.g. in Mārk, chap. 45), Brahmā is supposed to have created in the beginning four classes viz. gods, asuras, pitṛs and human beings. Vide also Brahmāṇḍapurāņa, Prakriyā, chap. 8, and upodghāta chap. 9. 35 (ityete pitaro devā devāśca pitaraḥ punaḥ anyonyapitaro hyete).

[^762]: This idea is at least Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-European, The ancient Parsi scriptures speak of _Fravashis_ that were originally the same as pitṛs of ancient Hindu works or the Manes among the ancient Romans. They were the everlasting and deified souls of the dead. Gradually the meaning of _Fravashi_ was extended and even Gods and objects like the Earth and the sky were supposed to have each a _Fravashi_. Vide S. B. E. vol. 4 p. 262 for the _Fravashis_ of the holy Yama and for the different classes of _Fravashis_; also S. B. E. vol. 23 pp. 180, 184, 230.

## The World of Pitṛs

It was supposed that the departed spirit, after the cremation of the body, was endowed with an ethereal body and became associated with Yama, the gatherer of departed men (Ṛg. X. 14.1 and 8, X. 15. 14, X. 16.5), and with pitṛs. The departed spirit went to the world of the _pitṛs_ and Agni was implored to take the spirit to the world of the departed whose deeds were good and to the stride of Viṣņu (Ṛg. X. 14. 9, X. 15.3, X. 16. 4).

Although Yama is said to dwell in heaven (_divi_) in Ṛg. X. 64.3, he is really a god of the middle region, as the Nirukta states[^767]. The Atharvaveda states:[^768] 'let us worship with obeisance the fathers and grandfathers of our father, that enter the wide middle regions, that dwell on the earth and in heaven.' In Ṛg. I. 35.6[^769] it is said : there are three worlds; two of them (Heaven and earth) are in the lap of Savitṛ; one (i. e. the middle region) is in the domain of Yama where departed spirits congregate, 'The great Luminary (the Sun) has risen, a gift of the pitṛs' (Ṛg. X. 107. 1). In the Tai. Br. I. 3. 10. 5[^770] it is said that the pitṛs dwell in the third world from this. This means that after _bhūloka_ and _antarikṣa_ comes the _pitṛloka_. In the Br. Up. I. 5.16 three worlds of men, pitṛs and gods are separately mentioned. In Ṛg. X. 135. 1-7, Yama is spoken of in somewhat different language. He is in this hymn mentioned as a god by himself and not as the first mortal who made a path (Ṛg. X. 14. 2) or as the gatherer of men (X. 14.1) or as being in company of the pitṛs. In a few other places Yama is no doubt called rājan and praised in the same breath with Varuṇa (Ṛg. X. 14,7). But such a position is very rarely mentioned. For the further development of Yama and his assistants as the punishers of men for evil deeds, vide pp. 159-160 above and notes 381-386.

[^767]: माध्यमिको यम इत्याहुः। तस्मान् माध्यमिकान पितॄन मन्यन्ते। निरुक्त XI.18. The Egyptian legend of Osiris presents many of the details connected with Yama. Vide Vulliamy's. 'Immortal man,' chap. V. pp 140-143.

[^768]: ये न: पितुः पितरो ये पितामहा य आविविशुरुर्वन्तरिक्षम्। य आक्षियन्ति पृथिवीमुत द्यां तेभ्यः पितृभ्यो नमसा विधेम ॥ अथर्ववेद 18. 2. 49.

[^769]:तिस्रो द्यावः सवितुर्द्वा उपस्थाँ एका यमस्य भुवने विराषाद् । ऋ. I. 35.6.

[^770]: तृतीये वा इतो लोके पितरः। तै. बा. I. 3.10.5; अथ त्रयो वाव लोका मनुष्यलोकः पितृलोको देवलोक इति सोऽयं मनुष्यलोकः पुत्रेणैव जय्यो नान्येन कर्मणा कर्मणा पितृलोको विद्यया देवलोको देवलोको वै लोकानां श्रेष्ठस्तस्माद्विद्यां प्रशंसन्ति । बृह. उ. I. 5.16

There is another division of pitṛs viz. _pitaraḥ somavantaḥ_[^771], _pitaraḥ barhiṣadaḥ_, _pitaraḥ agniṣvāttāḥ_. The latter two are named in Ṛg. X. 15. 4 and 11 (which occur also in Tai. S. II, 6. 12. 2). The Sat. Br. defines these as follows:-"those that performed a soma sacrifice are _pitaraḥ somavantaḥ_; those that offered cooked oblations (like _caru_ and puroḍāśa) and secured a world are _pitaraḥ barhiṣadaḥ_; those that did none of these (two actions) and whom fire consumes when burning them are '_pitaraḥ agniṣvāttāḥ_;' these are the only ones that are _pitaraḥ_." The Tai.[^772] Br. has a somewhat similar passage and the Kāthaka Samhita IX. 6. 17 also refers to these three kinds of _pitṛs_. Later writers introduced certain changes in the meanings of the words for the different classes of _pitṛs_ and also increased the number of the classes of _pitṛs_. For example, the Nandipurāņa q. by Hemādri states: the _pitṛs_ of brāhmaṇas are called 'agniṣvātta', those of kṣatriyas 'barhiṣadaḥ', those of vaiśyas 'kāvyas', those of südras 'sukālin' and those of mlecchas and untouchables are called 'vyāma'[^773].

[^771]: तद्ये सोमेनेजानाः। ते पितरः सोमवन्तोऽथ ये दत्तेन पक्वेन लोकं जयन्ति ते पितरो बर्हिषदोऽथ ये ततो नान्यतरच्चन यानग्निरेव दहन्स्वदयति ते पितरोऽग्निष्वात्ताः । एत उ ते ये पितरः । शतपथब्रा. II. 6.1.7.

[^772]: पितॄन् बर्हिषदो यजति ये वै यज्वानः ।...पितनग्निष्वात्तान् यजति ये वा अयज्वानो गृहमेधिनः । ते पितरो अग्निष्वात्ताः । अग्निं कव्यवाहनं यजति य एव पितॄणामग्निः । तस्मादा तृतीयात्पुरुषान्नामानि गृह्णन्ति । एतावन्तो हीज्यन्ते । ते. बा. I 6.9.5. वायुपुराण (30.6-7) echoes this 'अग्निष्वात्ताः स्मृतास्ते वै पित्रोऽनाहिताग्नयः। यज्वानस्तेषु ये ह्यासन् पितरः सोमपीथिनः । स्मृता बर्हिषदस्ते वै पितरोऽनाहिताग्नयः'.

[^773]: अग्निष्वात्ता ब्राह्मणानां पितरः परिकीर्तिताः। राज्ञां बर्हिषदो नाम विशां काव्याः प्रकीर्तिताः॥ सुकालिनस्तु शूद्राणां व्यामा म्लेच्छान्त्यजातिषु। q. by श्रा. प्र. P.11 from हेमाद्रि; compare मनु III. 197.      

Even Manu (III, 193-198) mentions several classes of _pitṛs_, connects pitṛs called Somapās, Havirbhujaḥ Ājyapās and Sukālins with the four varṇas and in III, 199 states that the pitṛs of brāhmanas are designated as Anagnidagdha, Agnidagdha, Kāvya, Barhiṣad, Agniṣvātta and Saumya. Those verses of Manu appear to summarize different traditions about the several classes of _pitṛs_. Vide Matsyapurāņa 141. 4 for the same last four names and 141. 15-18 for their definitions. In Sătātapasmṛti (VI. 5–6) twelve groups or divisions of _pitṛs_ are mentioned viz. piṇḍabhājaḥ (three), lepabhājaḥ (three), Nāndimukhas (three) and Aśrumukhas (three). This is a classification of pitṛs from two different standpoints. In Váyu 72,1 and 73.60, Brahmāṇḍa (Upodghāta 9.53), Padma V. 9. 2-3, Viṣṇudharmottara I. 138. 2-3 and other Purāṇas the classes of pitṛs are said to be seven, three of which are formless (_amūrtimat_) and four have forms (_mūrtimat_) and they and their offspring are described in detail. All this is passed over here. The Skandapurāņa (VI. 216. 9-10) speaks of nine groups of pitṛs, being Agniṣvāttāḥ, Barhiṣadaḥ, Ājyapāḥ, Somapāḥ, Raṣmipāḥ, Upahūtāḥ, those called 'āyantunaḥ', 'Śrāddhabhujaḥ, Nāndimukhāh. In this list old and new elements are mixed up. The Indian mind often revels in divisions, sub-divisions and classifications without much basis therefor and this is probably an illustration of that tendency. Manu (III. 201) states that from the sages the pitṛs sprang, from the pitṛs sprang gods and human beings and from the gods arose the whole world whether moving or immovable. It is remarkable that here the gods are spoken of as springing from the pitṛs. This is really a mere eulogy of pitṛs (i. e. it is an arthavāda).

The pitṛs were in a class apart from the gods. On the meaning of the word 'pañcajanāḥ' occurring in Ṛg. X.[^774] 53. 4. (pañcajanā mama hotram juşadhyam) and other passages, the Ait. Br. (13.7 or 3.31) explains that they are the five classes, viz. Gandharvas with Apsarases, pitṛs, devas, sarpas and _rākşasas_. The Nirukta III. 8 partly follows this explanation and also gives another. In the Atharvaveda X, 6.32 the gods, _pitṛs_ and men are mentioned in that order. The ancient Vedic texts and practice make a sharp distinction between the Gods and the Pitṛs. The Tai. S. VI. 1.1.1 states: 'the gods and men divided the quarters, the gods took the east, _pitṛs_ the south, men the west and Rudras the north.'

[^774]: पञ्च जना मम होत्रं जुषध्वम् । गन्धर्वाः पितरो देवा असुरा रक्षांसीत्यके। चत्वारो वर्णा निषादः पञ्चम इत्यौपमन्यवः। निरुक्त III. 8. The ऐ. बा. 13.7 has 'एतत्पञ्च जनाना मुक्थं देवमनुष्याणां गन्धर्वाप्सरसां सर्पाणां च पितॄणां च'. The real meaning of पञ्चजनाः is the same as that of पञ्चकृष्टयः (in Ṛg.x 60.4), पञ्च क्षितीर्मानुषीः (Ṛg. VII.79.1). पञ्च चर्षणीः (Ṛg. V. 86.2) and we have यत् पाञ्चजन्यया विशा in Ṛg. VIII. 63.7. पञ्चजनाः means विशः, the whole Aryan people divided probably into five clans. By the time of the Ait. Br. the original meaning of पञ्चजनाः was probably forgotten. The वेदान्तसूत्र (I. 4. 11-13) explains that the expression पञ्चजनानां occurring in Br. Up. IV. 4.17 refers to Praṇa, Caksuḥ (eye), ear, food and mind occurring in the next verse (Br. Up. IV. 4.18). Saṅkarācārya in his _bhaṣya_ on Vedāntasūtra I. 4.12 states that the word पञ्चजन in Ṛg. VIII. 63.7 means _prajā_ (people).

 The general rule is that sacrifices for gods are begun in the forenoon, while the pitṛ-yajña is performed in the afternoon (San. Br.)[^775]. The Sat. Br. II, 4.2.2 narrates that the pitṛs wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder (and under the left arm) and bending their left knee approached Prajāpati, when Prajāpati said to them 'you will have food at the end of) each month (on the Amāvāsyā), your _svadhā_ (cordial) will be swiftness of thought and the moon will be your light,' while to the gods he had said that sacrifice will be their food and the sun their light. The Tai. Br.[^776] I. 3. 10.4 appears to make a distinction between pitṛs who are of the nature and position of gods and pitṛs that are more or less like human beings.

The Kauśika-sūtra (1. 9-23) neatly collects in one place the difference in the procedure of the rites meant for gods and for pitṛs. The performer of rites for gods wears the sacred thread on the left shoulder and under the right armpit, while in the case of the rites for pitṛs it is worn on the right shoulder and under the left arm; the rite for gods is either begun facing the east or north, while that for the _pitṛs_ is begun facing the south; the rite for gods is finished in the north-east (or north or east), while that for the _pitṛs_ is completed in the south-west; an action is done only once for _pitṛs_, while for gods at least thrice or as many times as the texts direct; in going round (perambulating) the right side is turned towards gods and the left one in the case of _pitṛs_; offerings are made to gods with the words 'svāha' and 'vaşat', while they are made to pitṛs with 'svadhā' and 'namaskāra'; the darbhas employed in rites for Fathers are those that are taken out from the earth with their roots, while for gods darbhas used are cut a little above the roots.

[^775]: अथ यदपराह्णे पितृयज्ञेन चरन्ति अपक्षयभाजो वै पितरः। शा. ब्रा. V. 6.

[^776]: देवान् वै पितॄन् प्रीतान् मनुष्याः पितरोऽनुप्रपिपते । तिस्र आहुतीर्जुहोति त्रिर्निदधाति । षट् सम्पद्यन्ते । षड् वा ऋतवः। ऋतवः खलु वै देवाः पितरः । ऋतूनेव देवान् पितॄन् प्रीणाति । तान् प्रीतान्मनुष्याः पितरोऽनुप्रपिपते । ते. बा. I. 3, 10.4 (com explains अनुप्रपिपते ) as प्रीता भवन्ति). This is alluded to in the वायुपुराण 30, 4 'मध्वादयः षड् ऋत स्तिान । पितन्परिचक्षते । ऋतवः पितरो देवा इत्येषा वैदिकी श्रुतिः॥.'

The Baud. Sr. II, 2. also mentions some of these in one place[^777]. The Ṛgveda itself (in X. 14,3'svāhānye svadhayānye madanti') marks this distinction in the words employed at the offerings to Gods and _Pitṛs_. The Sat. Br. (II. 1,3,4 and II. 1.4.9) speaks of the gods as immortal and of the Fathers as mortal.

Though the gods and pitřs are placed in separate classes, still the _pitṛs_ partake of some characteristics of the divine. As Ṛg. X. 15. 8 shows, the pitṛs drank Soma. In Ṛg. X.68.11 it is said that the _pitṛs_ adorned the sky with nakşatras (nakṣatrebhiḥ pitaro dyām-apimśan) and placed darkness in the night and light in the day. The pitṛs are said to have found out the light that was secreted and to have produced the Dawn (Ṛg. VII. 76. 4). Here the _pitṛs_ are credited with powers possessed by the highest gods. The pitṛs are invoked with affection and regard for conferring various boons and their favour is sought in various ways. In Ṛg. X, 14. 6 the good will (_sumati_) and favour (_saumanasa_) of the pitṛs are sought. In Ṛg. X. 15. 1. and 5 the protection of pitṛs is sought. They are requested to grant happiness unmixed with trouble (Ṛg. X. 15. 4.), to bestow wealth on the sacrificer (Ṛg. X. 15.7 and 11) and on his son. Ṛg. X. 15.11 and A. V. 18. 3. 14[^778] seek the bestowal of wealth and heroic sons, A. V. 14. 2.73 says ‘May the _pitṛs_ who throng round the bride to see her grant her happiness endowed with progeny.'[^779] In the Vāj. S. II. 33 occurs[^780] the well-known mantra 'Oh pitṛs! deposit (in this wife ) an embryo, a child that (will wear later) a garland of lotuses so that he may become a grown-up male' repeated when the wife of the performer of the śrāddha eats the middle one out of the three piṇḍas.

The खादिरगृह्य III. 5. 30 provides 'मध्यमं पिण्डं पुत्रकामा प्राशयेदाधत्तेति ; vide गोभिलगृह्य IV. 3.27 and also कौशिकसूत्र 89.6. The आश्व. श्री. II. 7.13 reads पत्नी प्राशयेदाधत्त पितरो...स्रजम्। यथायमरपा असत्. The Asvins are called पुष्करस्रजौ and so in पुष्करस्रजं the idea is that the son may be long-lived and handsome. यथेह...असत् may be explained as 'येन प्रकारेण इहैव क्षितौ पुरुषो देवपितृमनुष्याणाम- भष्टिपूरयिता भूयात् तथा गर्भमाधत्त ।' बाह्मणसर्वस्व of हलायुध. कात्या. श्री. IV. 1.22 also says आधत्तेति मध्यमपिण्डं पत्नी प्राश्नाति पुत्रकामा.

## Attitude to Pitṛs

It should not be, however, supposed that the element of fear of the pitṛs is altogether wanting[^780a]. For example, Ṛg. X. 15.6 prays 'whatever fault we may commit in reference to you through our being (erring) men do not injure us for that.' In Ṛg. III. 55. 2 we read 'May the gods and the ancient _pitṛs_ who know the place (of the cows or the path ) not harm us here.' In Ṛg.X.66. 14 it is said the Vasiṣṭhas praising the gods fashioned speech (hymns ) like _pitṛs_ and like sages.' Here pitṛs and ṛșis are separate groups and Vasiṣṭhas are compared to both[^780b].

In many passages of the Vedic Literature the word _pitaraḥ_ is applied to the three immediate deceased male ancestors of a man. "Therefore up to three generations they specify (the ancestors) by name; for so many are the ones to whom sacrifice is offered' (vide n. 772 above). The Sat. Br. II, 4. 2. 19[^781] mentions the presentation formulas of the cakes to the father, grand-father and great-grand-father and then states that the performer mutters the words "here, O fathers! regale yourselves, like bulls come here each to his own share' (Vāj. S. II. 31 first half). Some (such as Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1) repeated the formula "this here (ball of rice ) is for thee and (for those ) that come after thee." But the Śat. Br. emphatically says that he should not offer with this formula, but rather with the formula 'this here is for thee'. In Sat. Br. XII. 8. 1. 17 the three immediate paternal ancestors are said to be svadhā-loving. Relying on these Vedic passages and on the fact that Manu (III. 221 ) and Viṣṇudharmasūtra (21. 3,75. 4) prescribe the invocation of pitṛs after mentioning their gotra and names that the Śrāddhaprakāśa (p. 13) concludes that it is really the father and the other ancestors that are the deities of śrāddha and not Vasu, Rudra and Āditya, since these latter have no gotra and that the description of the father and others as Vasu, Rudra and Āditya is meant only for contemplation (on them as identical with Vasus &c.).

[^780a]: Compare Vulliamy's 'Immortal man' (pp. 24-25) for fear and affection as the elements of the attitude towards the dead among primitive as well as civilized men.

[^780b]: देवाः सौम्याश्च काव्याश्च अयज्वानो ह्ययोनिजाः। देवास्ते पितरः सर्वे देवास्तान्वादयन्त्युत॥ मनुष्यपितरश्चैव तेभ्योऽन्ये लौकिकाः स्मृताः । पिता पितामहश्चैव तथा यः प्रपितामहः॥ ब्रह्माण्डपुराण II. 28.70-71; अङ्गिराश्च क्रतुश्चैव कश्यपश्च महानृषिः। एते कुरुकुलश्रेष्ठ महायोगेश्वराः स्मृताः। एते च पितरो राजन्नेष श्राद्धविधिः परः । प्रेतास्तु पिण्ड सम्बन्धान्मुच्यन्ते तेन कर्मणा ॥ अनु. 92.21-22. This last shows that ancient sages like आंगिरस, ऋतु and कश्यप are पितृs to whom water is offered (and no पिण्डs), while piṇḍas are offered to one's immediate deceased ancestors.

[^781]: स ददाति । असावेतत्त इत्येव यजमानस्य पित्रे ये च त्वामन्वित्यु हैके आहुस्तदु तथा न ब्रूयात् स्वयं वै तेषां सह येषां सह तस्माद् ब्रूयादसावेतत्त इत्येव यजमानस्य पित्रे असावेतत्ते इति पितामहायासावेतत्त इति प्रपितामहाय। तद्यदितः पराग्ददाति सकृदु ह्येव पराञ्चः पितरः । शतपथ II. 8.42. The ते. सं. I.8.5.1 is: सोमाय पितृमते पुरोडाशं षट्कपालं निर्वपति पितृभ्यो बर्हिषद्भ्यो धानाः पितृभ्योग्निष्वात्तेभ्योऽभिवान्यायै दुग्धे मन्थम् । एतत् ते तत ये च त्वामनु एतत् ते पितामह प्रपितामह ये च त्वामनु अत्र पितरो यथाभागं मन्दध्वम् ।. Again in तै. सं. III. 2.5.5 occurs the passage 'एतत्ते तत...मन्दध्वम् ।. This is carried on to later times as in अनु० 92.15 'सोमायेति च वक्तव्यं तथा पितृमतेति च'. Vide also अथर्व० 18. 4. 71-77 'अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नमः। सोमाय पितृमते स्वधा नमः । पितृभ्यः सोमवद्भ्यः स्वधा नमः । यमाय पितृमते स्वधा नमः। एतत्ते प्रततामह स्वधा ये च त्वामनु । एतत्ते ततामह स्वधा ये च त्वामनु । एतत्ते तत स्वधा'।. In Ṛg. IX.11.2.3 कारुरहं ततो भिषक्, तत means father'. नपात् (=पौत्र) and प्रणपात् (प्रपौत्र) occur in Ṛg. VIII. 17.13.

On a passage of the Brahmapurāņa[^782] prescribing that the performer should say to the invited brāhmaṇas that he would call the pitṛs to the rites and that when the brāhmaṇas give permission to call them he should do so, the Śr. P. (p. 204) remarks that the pitṛs here meant are the divine ones viz. Vasus, Rudras and Ādityas and also the human ones viz. the performer's father and the rest. The Vāyupurāṇa (56. 65-66) Brahmāṇḍa and Anu. distinguish between pitṛs who are above and pitṛs who are _laukika_, viz. father, grand-father and great-grand-father. Vide also Vāyu 70. 34 for pitṛs that are like gods.

In the post-Vedic Literature, particularly in the Purāṇas, a great deal is said about the origin and classes of pitṛs. For example, the Vāyupurāṇa 56. 18 speaks of three classes of pitṛs viz. 'kāvyāh, barhiṣadaḥ and agniṣvāttāḥ', while the same Purāṇa, chap. 73, Varāha 13. 16 ff, Padma (Sṛṣṭi 9. 2-4) and Brahmāṇḍa III. 10.1 speak of the origin of pitṛs of seven classes that dwell in heaven, four of which have a form (_mürtimat_) and three of which are without form (_amūrta_). The Śātātapa-smṛti (6. 5-6 ) speaks of 12 pitṛs viz. piṇḍabhājaḥ, lepabhājaḥ, nāndimukhāḥ and aśrumukhāḥ. All such descriptions have to be passed over from considerations of space.

[^782]: ब्रह्मपुराणे । पितॄनावाहयामीति स्वयमुक्त्वा समाहितः। आवाहयस्वेति परैरुक्तस्त्वा वाहयेच्छुचिः॥ पितरो दिव्याः वसुरुद्रादित्याः मानुषाः यजमानस्य पित्रादयः। श्रा. प्र. p. 204.

## Promulgators of śrāddha rites

From the sūtra period ( about 600 B.C.) to the most modern among medieval Dharmaśāstra works the authors wax eloquent over the praises or the importance or benefits of the institution of śrāddhas. One of the earliest works among these, viz. the Ap. Dh. S. gives the following interesting information :[^783] “Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. The gods went to heaven owing to sacrifices (i. e, as a reward of sacrifices that they performed), but men remained behind. Those among men who perform sacrifices in the same way as the gods did, dwell in the other world (i.e. heaven) with the gods and Brahman. Then (seeing that men lagged behind) Manu promulgated the rite which is designated by the word 'śrāddha' and which tends to the salvation (or happiness) of mankind. In this rite the Manes (pitaraḥ) are the deities but the brāhmaṇas (that are fed) are in the place of the _āhavaniya_ fire (in which in sacrifices to gods oblations are offered)". On account of this last sūtra Haradatta (com, of Āp. Dh, S.) and others hold that feeding the brāhmaṇas is the principal act at a śrāddha. The Brahmāṇḍapurāņa (Upodghātapāda 9. 15. and 10. 99) speaks of Manu as the promulgator of śrāddha rites and Viṣņupurāņa III. 1. 30, Vāyu 44. 38 and Bhāgavata III. 1, 22 designate Manu as Śrāddha-deva, Similarly, in the Sāntiparva 345[^784]. 14-21 and the Viṣṇu-dharmottara I.139.14-16 it is stated that the institution of śrāddha was established in the Boar incarnation by Viṣṇu and that Viṣṇu should be regarded as dwelling in the three piṇḍas offered to the father, grand-father and great-grandfather. From this and from the passage of the Ap. Dh. S. cited above we may infer that it was believed even several centuries before Christ that the institution of śrāddhas had a hoary antiquity behind it and that it was as old as Manu, the father of mankind according to the Ṛgveda (VIII. 63.1, VIII. 30. 3.). It is, however, very remarkable that the word 'śrāddha' itself does not occur in any undoubtedly authentic and ancient Vedic passage, though the rite called Piņdapitṛyajña[^785] (performed on the _amāvāsyā_ of each month by an _Āhitāgni_, the Mahāpitṛyajña (performed in the Cāturmāsya called Sākamedha) and the rites called Aṣṭakās were known to the early Vedic literature.

[^785]: That पिण्डपितृयज्ञ is a श्राद्ध is stated by गोभिलगृह्य IV 4 1-2 'अन्वष्टक्यस्थालीपाकेन पिण्डपितृयज्ञो व्याख्यातः। अमावास्यां तच्छ्राद्धमितरदन्वहार्यम्।' Vide श्रा.प्र. p, 4 for the same. For a description of पिण्डपितृयज्ञ, vide H.of Dh, vol. II. pp. 1085-1090, for महापितृयज्ञ, _ibid_, pp. 1101-1103.

The word śrāddha occurs in the Kaṭhopanişad (1.3.17) 'whoever proclaims this highly esoteric doctrine in an assembly of brāhmaṇas or at the time of śrāddha tends to secure immortality'[^786]. The other early occurrences of the word śrāddha known to me are confined to the sutra literature. The most reasonable and probable inference to be drawn from these facts is this that only a few rites (mentioned just above) were known as related to the _pitṛs_ and that there fore no need arose for a generic term in very ancient times to comprehend several rites for the _pitṛs_. But when the number of rites in honour of _pitṛs_ increased, the generic term 'śrāddha' was hit upon.

A few samples of the panegyrics on śrāddha may be set out here. The Baud.[^787] Dh. S. states that rites for the Fathers confer long life, heaven, fame and prosperity. The Harivaṁśa[^788] says 'the would derives support from śrāddha and Yoga (i. e. Mokşa) springs from it.' Sumantu[^789] quoted in the Smr̥ticandrikā (śrāddha p. 333) states nothing else is declared to be more beneficial than śrāddha.' The Viṣṇupurāṇa (III. 14, 1-4) avers that if a man performs śrāddha with faith he thereby propitiates Brahmā, Indra, Rudra and the other gods, sages, birds, men, beasts, creeping animals, hosts of pitṛs and whatever else is styled a being and the whole world. Yāj. I. 270[^790] promising long life and several other benefits arising from gratifying _pitṛs_ has already been quoted above (p. 337). Yama has a similar verse. It is said in a passage of the Viṣṇudharmottara[^791] quoted by the Śrāddhasāra (p,6) and Śrāddhaprakāśa (pp. 11-12) that the _piṇḍa_ offered to the great-grandfather is declared to be god Vāsudeva himself, the one to the grandfather is designated Saṇkarṣaṇa, that to the father is known as Pradyumna and the offerer of the piṇḍas is himself in the position of Aniruddha. In Śāntiparva 345. 21 it is stated that Viṣṇu should be looked upon as staying in the three piṇḍas. In the Kūrmapurāņa it is stated on the day of _Amāvāsyā_ the pitṛs assuming an aerial form come to the door of their former haunt and mark whether śrāddha is being performed by men of their family. This they do till sunset. When the sun sets, being oppressed by hunger and thirst, they become full of despair and feel sorrow, breathe heavily for a long time and go away condemning their descendants. The pitṛs of him who does not offer śrāddha on amāvāsyā, even with water or vegetables, go away after cursing him'.

## Panegyries of śrāddha


It is necessary to say a few words about the derivation of the word 'śrāddha'. That the word is derived from 'śraddhā' is quite clear. In the definition quoted above from the Brahmapurāna and the definition[^792] given by Marici and Bṛhaspati the connection of śrāddha with śraddha is emphasized. In śrāddha one entertains the firm faith or conviction that what is given up to the brāhmaṇas for the benefit of the departed man or the Fathers will reach him or them in some way. The Skandapurāṇa VI. 218.3 says that śrāddha is so called because śraddhā is the root (or main spring) of that rite. This means that there is not only the conviction stated above but that there is a firm belief that a person is under an obligation to offer it. Śraddhā is deified and addressed as a deity in Ṛg.[^793] X. 151. 1-5, the first verse of which is explained in the Nirukta (IX, 31). The word also occurs in Ṛg. II. 26.3, VII. 32. 14, VIII, 1.31, IX. 113. 4. In some verses the two components of the word 'śraddhā' (viz. 'śrat' and 'dhā') are separated without any change in the meaning. For example, in Ṛg. II. 12. 5 (= A. V. 20. 34, 5) it is said 'Have faith in him; O people! he is Indra'. In Ṛg. X. 147. 1, addressed to Indra, we have 'I have faith in that high wrath of yours &c.' (śratte dadhāmi prathamāya manyave).

[^792]: प्रेतं पितॄंश्च निर्दिश्य भोज्यं यत्प्रियमात्मनः। श्रद्धया दीयते यत्र तच्छ्राद्धं परि कीर्तितम् ॥ मरीचि quoted from the पृथ्वीचन्द्रोदय by निर्णयसिन्धु III. p. 372, श्रा. प्र. p. 7; संस्कृतं व्यञ्जनाढ्यं च पयोमधुघृतान्वितम्। श्रद्धया दीयते यस्माच्छाद्धं तेन निगद्यते॥ । बृहस्पति q. by हेमाद्रि p. 152, अपरार्क p. 501, कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 176) श्रा.प्र.p.3, श्राद्धतत्व p. 189 quotes it as पुलस्त्य's .

[^793]: श्रद्धयाग्निः समिध्यते श्रद्धया हूयते हविः । श्रद्धां भगस्य मूर्धनि वचनों वैदयामसि ॥ ऋ.X. 151. 1.

In the Tai, S. VII. 4. 1. 1. it is[^794] said “Bṛhaspati desired' may the gods put faith in me, may I reach the position of being their priest'". Vide also Ṛg. I. 103.5. _Śrat_ and _śraddhā_ are both mentioned in the Nighaṇṭu (III. 10) as meaning '_satya_'. In the Vāj. S. 19.77 we are told that Prajāpati put Śraddhā in truth and aśraddha in falsehood, while in Vāj. S. 19.30, it is said that truth is obtained by śraddhā.

In the post-vedic Literature, Pāṇini explains the forms 'śrāddhin' and 'śrāddhika' in y. 2. 85, in the sense of one who has eaten a śrāddha dinner.' The word 'śrāddha' may be derived from śraddhā according to Pān. V.1.109 795. Śrāddha is variously defined. In the _bhāsya_ on Yogasūtra I. 20, 'śraddha' is defined as the composure of the mind[^796] (or mental approval). Devala defines śraddhā: 'confidence (in the efficacy) of religious acts is called śraddhā; one who has no faith has no reason (or motive) for engaging in religious acts:[^797]. The Śrāddhasūtra[^798] of Katyāyana prescribes 'one endowed with śraddhā should offer śrāddha even with vege tables (if nothing else is available). Vide Manu III, 275 which emphasizes śraddhā for the gratification of pitṛs. The Mārkaṇḍeyapurāņa (29. 27) emphasizes[^799] the relation of śrāddha to śraddhā and states that what is offered at śrāddhas becomes transformed into that kind of food for the use of the pitṛs who require food in the new bodies they might have assumed according to the doctrine of _karma_ and _punarjanma_ and it also remarks that śrāddha offered with wealth acquired in an improper or unjust way is a means of gratification to the pitṛs that are born as cāņḍālas, pukkasas and similar very low grades of people.

## Aṣṭakā śrāddha

It has already been stated above (pp. 349-350) that in very ancient times there were only three rites for departed ancestors, viz. Piṇḍa-pitṛ-yajña (offered by those who had consecrated the śrauta fires) or monthly Śrāddha in the case of those who had not done so (vide e. g. Ašv. Gr. II. 5. 10, Hir. Gr. II. 10. 1, Āp. Gr. VIII. 21. 1, Viṣṇupurāņa III. 14. 3 &c.), the Mahāpitṛyajña and the Aṣṭakā śrāddhas. The first two have been already described in vol. II (as said above), but the Aṣṭakā śrāddhas have not been described at all so far. Therefore some remarks will be offered here about them. They are of special importance, but the authorities present great variations on almost all points such as the number of days and the months in which they were to be performed, the deities to be worshipped, the offerings to be made and the procedure to be followed.

Gaut. (VIII, 19) mentions 'Aṣṭakā' rite as the first among the seven kinds of _pākayajñas_ and as one of the forty _saṁskāras_. Aṣṭakā appears to have meant the 8th _tithi_ in any month after the Full Moon day (vide Sat. Br. VI. 4. 2.10). The Sat. Br. states[^800] 'On the 8th day (after full moon) he (the performer of _agnicayana_ ) collects the materials for the fire pan, for sacred to Prajāpati is the 8th day (after full moon) and sacred to Prajapati is this rite viz. the firepan.' Sabara in his _Bhāṣya_ on Jai.[^801] I.3.cites a verse occurring in the A, V. III, 10. 2 and in the Ap. M. P. II. 20. 27 as a _mantra_ indicative of Aṣṭakā. The mantra is "May that (Aṣṭakā) night be very auspicious for us, whom people welcome like a cow coming towards a person and which is the wife of the Year.' In the A. V. IIL 10. 8 the Ekāstakā is said to have the year (_Saṁvatsara_) as husband. The Tai. S. VII. 4. 8. 1. provides[^802]' Men about to take dikşā (consecration) for a _Saṁvatsarasattra_ should undergo dikşā on the _Ekāşṭakā_; what is called Ekāṣṭakā is the wife of the year.' Jai. (VI. 5. 32-37) explains that Ekāṣṭakā is the 8th _tithi_ after the Full Moon of Māgha.

[^800]: अष्टकायामुखां सम्भरति । प्राजापत्यमेतदहर्यदष्टका प्राजापत्यमेतत्कर्म यदुखा प्राजापत्य एव तदहन प्राजापत्यं कर्म करोति । शतपथ VI.2.2.23.

[^801]: अष्टकालिङ्गाश्च मन्त्रा वेदे दृश्यन्ते यां जनाः प्रतिनन्दन्तीत्येवमादयः। शबर on जै. I. 3.2. The verse as read by शबर on जै.VI 5.35 is: यां जनाः प्रतिनन्दन्ति रात्रिं धेनुमिवायतीम् । संवत्सरस्य या पत्नी सा नो अस्तु सुमङ्गली॥ and he adds 'अष्टकाये सुराधसे स्वाहा'. In the A. V. III. 10.2 the readings are देवाः for जनाः and धेनुमुपायतीम्।

[^802]: संवत्सराय दीक्षिष्यमाणा एकाष्टकायां दीक्षेरन्नेषा वै संवत्सरस्य पत्नीयवेकाष्टका। ते सं. VII. 4.8.1.

The Āp. Gr. (quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 8. 19) says[^803] the same, but adds that on it (the 8th _tithi_) the moon is in Jyeṣṭhā constellation. This means that if the 8th _tithi_ is spread over two days, then that day on which the moon is in Jyeṣṭhā would be called Ekāṣṭakā[^804]. The Hir. Gr. (II, 15.9) also says that Ekāṣṭakā is called the wife of the year[^805].

According to the Āśv. Gr. II, 4. 1 the Aṣṭakā days (and rites ) were four, viz. the 8th _tithis_ of the dark halves of the four months of the two seasons of _hemanta_ and _śiśira_ (i. e. of Mārgaśirşa, Pauṣa, Māgha and Phālguna). Most of the Gr̥hyasütras viz. Mānava Gr. II. 8, Sān. Gr. III. 12.1, Khādira Gr. III. 3.27, Kathaka Gr. 61.1, Kausitaki Gr. III. 15. 1 and Pār, Gr. UIT. 3 say that there are only three Aṣṭakā rites viz. on the 8th after the Full Moon day of Mārgaśīrsa (called agrahāyaṇi) i.e. in the dark halves of Mārgaśirṣa, Pauṣa (or Taiṣa) and Māgha. The Gobhila Gr. III, 10.48 mentions that the Aṣṭakās are four according to Kautsa and in all flesh is to be offered, but that Gautama, Audgāhamāni and Vārkakhaṇḍi prescribe only three and Gobhila follows these latter, The Baud. Gr. II. 11. 1 provides that the three Aṣṭakā homas are performed in the months of Taiṣa, Māgha and Phālguna. Āśv. Gr. II. 4.2 refers to an option that Aṣṭakā rites were performed only on one Aṣṭami (and not on three or four). The Baud. Gr. provides that[^806] the rite may be compressed into the three days (7th, 8th and 9th ) of the dark half of Māgha or even in one day (i.e. 8th of the dark half of Māgha).

[^803]: या माध्याः पौर्णमास्या उपरिष्टाद् व्यष्टका तस्थामष्टमी ज्येष्ठया सम्पद्यते तामेकाष्टकेत्याचक्षते । आप. गृ. VIII. 21.10; अष्टकां व्याख्यास्यामः । माध्याः पौर्णमास्या योऽपरपक्षस्तस्याष्टमीमेकाष्टकेत्याचक्षते । हिर. गृ. II. 14.1-2. Both अनाकुला and तात्पर्यदर्शन explain व्यष्टका as कृष्णपक्षः.

[^804]: According to a Vārtika on Pan. VII. 3. 45 the word Aṣṭakā is formed from 'aṣṭan.' बार्तिक 9 on पाणिनि VII. 3.45 teaches that from अष्टन् ve get Aṣṭakā as meaning a rite in which the pitr̥s are the deities and Aṣṭika in any other sense (such as अष्टिका खारी).

[^805]: The Full Moon night of Māgha is said to be the month of the year i. e. the year began on that day in ancient times. The Aṣṭakā day after the Full Moon day was the first and most important festival after the Full Moon and it was younger than the beginning of the year. It is probable that because of this it was spoken of as the wife of the year.

[^806]: अथाष्टकाहोमः। तैषे मास्यपरपक्षस्याष्टम्यां क्रियेत। एवं माघे एवं फाल्गुने या विहृतः । यधु वै समस्त उपरिष्टान्माध्याः पौर्णमास्या अपरपक्षस्य सप्तम्यामष्टम्यां नवम्यामिति क्रियेतापि वाष्टम्यामेव । बौ. गृ. II. 11.1-4.

The Hir. Gr. (II. 14. 2) describes only one Aṣṭakā rite viz. the Ekāṣṭaka in the dark half of Māgha. The Bhāradvāja Gṛhya II. 15 also speaks of only Ekāṣṭakā but adds that the 8th of the dark half of Māgha on which the moon is in Jyeṣṭhā is called Ekāṣṭakā. According to Hir. Gr. II. 14 and 15 the one Aṣṭakā extended over three days viz. 8th, 9th (on which a cow was sacrificed for the _pitṛs_) and 10th (which was the Anvaṣṭakā). The Vaikhānasa-smārtasūtra (ed. by Caland) IV. 8 says that Aṣṭakā is to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Māgha and Bhādrapada or on the 7th, 9th or 10th tithi.

There is divergence in the offerings also. The Kāthaka Gṛ (61.3), Jaimini Gr. 2.3 and Sān. Gr. (III, 12.2 ) provide that on the three different Aṣṭakās the offerings are of cooked vegetables, flesh and _apūpas_ (cakes), while the Pār. Gr. III, 3 and Khădira Gr. III. 3. 29-30 put _apūpas_ for the first Aṣṭakā (and hence Gobhila Gr. III, 10. 9 designates it _apūpāşṭaka_) and boiled vegetables on the last. According to Khādira Gr. III, 4. 1 a cow is sacrificed. According to Āśv. Gr. II. 4.7-10, Gobhila Gr. IV. 1. 18-22, Kauśika 138.2, Baud. Gr. II, 11, 51-61, on the 8th day very many options are given, viz, either to sacrifice a cow or a ram or a goat; or to offer some jungle flesh that may be available or flesh mixed with sesame and honey, or flesh of the rhinoceros, deer, buffalo, ram, boar, spotted deer, hare, Rohita deer, pigeons, śārnga and other birds, or an old red goat; fishes or rice cooked in milk so as to form thin gruel, or gifts only of uncooked corn or fruits and roots, or gold may be offered or only grass for cows or oxen or one may burn some thickets in a forest or present jars for holding water to those deeply learned in the Veda or should recite the mantras relating to śrāddhas, saying 'this is the Aṣṭakā I offer,' but one should not remain without observing the Aṣṭakā day in some such manner as the above[^807].

[^807]: अथ यदि गां न लभते मेषमजं वा लभते। आरण्येन वा मांसेन यथोपपन्नेन । खङ्गमृगमहिषमेषवराहपृषतशशरोहितशार्ङ्गतित्तिरिकपोतकपिञ्जलवाध्रीणसानामक्षय्यं तिलमधु संसृष्टम् । तथा मत्स्यस्य शतवलेः (?) क्षीरोदनेन वा सूपोदनेन वा। यद्वा भवत्यामैर्वा मूलफले: प्रदानमात्रम् । हिरण्येन वा प्रदानमात्रम् । अपि वा गोग्रासमाहरेत् । अपि वानूचानेभ्य उदकुम्भानाहरेत् । अपि वा श्राद्धमन्त्रानधीयीत। अपि वारण्येग्निना  कक्षमुपोषेदेषा मेऽष्टकेति । न त्वेवानष्ट कः स्यात् । बौ. गृ.

It is remarkable that although the Vārtika quoted above, and the Kathakagṛhya 61.1 state that the word "Aṣṭakā' is applied to a rite in which the _pitṛs_ are the deities worshipped, the greatest divergence prevails as to the _devatā_ of the Aṣṭakās. The Āśv. Gr. (II. 4.3 and II. 5. 3-5) provides that on the 7th of the dark half the offerings are made to the _pitṛs_ and on the 9th also, but Āśv. II, 4. 12 refers to the eight options as regards the deity of the 8th day, viz. _Viśve-devāḥ_ (all the gods ), Agni, Sürya, Prajāpati, Rātri (night), Nakṣatras (constellations ), the seasons, the _Pitṛs_, Pašus (cattle). The Gobhila Gr. III. 10.1 starts[^808] by saying that Night is the _devatā_ of Aṣṭakā, but adds that there are other views about the devatā being Agni, the _Pitṛs_, Prajāpati, Ṛtus (seasons) or all Gods.

The procedure of Aṣṭakā comprises three parts, viz. _homa_, inviting brāhmaṇas for dinner (up to seeing them go away after dinner) and the rite called Anvaṣṭakya or Anvaṣṭakā. When the Aṣṭakās were deemed to be three or four performed in the several months noted above, all these were gone through at each Aşṭakā. When the Aṣṭakā rite was performed only in one month i. e, after the Full moon in Māgha, the above parts were performed on three days, 7th, 8th and 9th of the dark half. When compressed in one day only, they must have been performed one after another on the same day.

Many of the Gṛhyasūtras, such as those of Āśvalāyana, Kauśika, Gobhila, Hiraṇyakeśin and Baudhāyana describe a very elaborate procedure in the case of Aṣṭakās. One of the shortest being that contained in Ap. Gr. (VIII. 21 and 22 ) is given here by way of sample[^808a]. After defining Ekāṣṭakā (in VIII, 21. 10) Āp. proceeds: 'He (the performer of the Aṣṭakā rite) should perform subsidiary (or preparatory) rites in the evening of the previous day (i.e, on the 7th of the dark half). He cooks (or bakes) a cake from rice taken up (from a heap) in four cups; according to some teachers the cake is prepared on eight potsherds (like a puroḍāśa).

## Procedure of Aṣṭakā

After the actions up to the 'Ājyabhāgas'[^809] have been performed in the same way as at the Amāvāsyã and Full Moon sacrifices he makes with his joined hands oblations of the cakes with the next verse[^810]. The rest of the cake that is already baked is divided by him into eight parts and offered to the brāhmaṇas[^811]. On the following day he prepares the cow for immolation by touching her with a darbha with the words 'I make thee that are agreeable to the Fathers ready (for sacrifice)'. Having silently (i.e, without uttering the word _svāhā_ ) offered five[^812] oblations of clarified butter, having cooked the omentum of that (cow) and having spread under (the cooked omentum) and sprinkled over it clarified butter he offers it with a _palāśa_ leaf from the middle or the end of the stalk with the next verse (i. e. Āp. M. P. II. 20. 28), [^813]. He offers boiled rice together with the flesh (of the cow) with the next verses (seven from Ap. M. P. II. 20. 29-35). He offers the food of flour cooked (in milk) with the next verse (Ap. M. P. II. 21.1 'Ukthyaścātirātrasca')[^814]. Then (he offers) the oblations of clarified butter with the following (eight) verses ( Āp. M. P. II. 21. 2–9). The rites from Sviṣṭakṛt[^815] down to the placing of the _piṇḍas_ are the same as at the monthly śrāddha (described in Āp. Gr. VIII-21. 1-9). Some teachers prescribe that the piṇḍas are to be offered the day after the Aṣṭakā (i. e, on the 9th of the dark half). Here follows another method (of celebrating the Aṣṭakā rite ). He sacrifices curds with his joined hands in the same way as he offers the cake. Having left over from the meat of the cow) as much as may be required, he performs on the day following (the Aṣṭakā day) the Anvaṣṭakā rite. Its procedure is explain ed by the description of the monthly śrāddha.

[^811]: The words 'siddhaḥ śesaḥ' are explained by the Anākula (of Haradatta) as meaning 'the rest of the rites are the usual ones without alterations',

Though Āp. Gr. (II. 5.3) and San. Gr. III, 13. 7 state that the Anvaṣṭakya rite follows the procedure of Piṇḍapitṛyajña, some Gṛhyasūtras (such as Khădira III, 5, Gobhila IV. 2-3) give very elaborate descriptions of that rite. The Āśv. Gr. and Viṣṇudharmasūtra 74 follow a middle course. The description in Āśv. Gr. is comparatively brief and it is set out below. It may be noted that some Gṛhya-sūtras state that the Anvaṣṭakya rite is performed on the 9th or 10th of the dark half (e. g. Khădira Gr. III. 5. 1 'navamim daśamim vānvaṣṭakyam )'. Further, it may be stated that though most Gṛhyasūtras call the rite Anvaṣṭakya still it is also called Anvaṣṭaka by Pār. Gr. III, 3. 10, Manu IV. 150, Viṣṇudharmasūtra 74.1 and 76. 1. The most notable peculiarity of this rite is that therein female ancestors are invoked and offerings are made to them of which liquor (_surā_), scum of boiled rice, collyrium, salves and garlands form part. Though some sūtras (like Āớv. Gr. II. 5) declare that the Aṣṭakā and Anvaṣṭakya are modelled on the monthly śrāddha or Piṇḍapitṛyajña, others (like the Baud. Gr. III, 12. 1. Gobhila Gr. IV, 4., Khădira III, 5. 35) say that the Aṣṭakā or Anvaṣṭakya is the norm which is followed in the Piṇḍapitṛyājña and all the śrāddhas. The Kāthaka Gr. (66. 1, 67. 1, 68. 1, 69. 1) avers[^816] that the first śrāddha, the other śrāddhas (such as sapiņḍikaraṇa), Pasuśrāddha (in which the flesh of an animal is offered) and the śrāddha performed every month follow the procedure of Aṣṭakā. The Piṇḍa-pitṛyajña could be offered on amāvāsyā only by one who was _āhitāgni_ (i.e. had kept the sacred vedic fires). It is impossible to believe that everyone became āhitāgni. The case was probably the reverse i.e. only a few became _āhitāgnis_ and the rest had only the gṛhya fire or many of the rest were without even the gṛhya fire. It appears possible that all were required to offer śrāddha on amāvāsyā on the analogy of piṇḍapitṛyajña. As the latter became rare, the requirement of offering śrāddha on amăvāsyā remained and in the sütras and smṛtis all the details were mentioned under māsiśrāddha and in the case of the other śrāddhas the sutras and smṛtis pointed out only what was to be omitted. It is owing to this that the māsiśrāddha came to be called the _prakṛti_ and the other śrāddhas were called _vikṛtis_ or variations of the māsišrāddha. Most of the details of the piṇḍapitṛyajña were required in māsiśrāddha and a few (such as giving arghya, _gandha_, dipa ) were added and more elaborate rules evolved.

[^816]: देवपाल on काठकगृह्य 66.1. says अष्टकाविकाराणि हि सर्वश्राद्धानि. The बौ. गृ III. 12. 1 states 'अष्टकानुकृतिर्मासिकं तत्पुरस्ताद् व्याख्यातम्.''

## The Anvaṣṭakya śrāddha

The Anvaṣṭakya[^817] is described in the Āśv. Gr. (II. 5. 2-15) as follows:-Having prepared a portion of the same meat[^818] having established the fire on a surface sloping towards the south, having fenced it in and made a door on the north side of the enclosed shed, having strewn round the fire three times sacrificial grass with its roots without touching it, turning the left side (of one's body) towards the fire, he should place down the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice mixed with sesamum, rice cooked in milk, meal pap with curds and meal pap with honey. The ceremony should follow the ritual of the Piṇḍapitṛyajña (vide Āśv. Śr. II. 6). Having sacrificed (part of the foods specified except meal-pap) with honey let him offer portions of those substances to the pitṛs and to their wives with the addition of liquor and the scum of boiled rice. Some place the portion to be offered into pitṛs, which may be two or six. In those situated to the east he should present the offerings to the pitṛs; in those to the west, to the wives. Thereby the ceremony celebrated in the rainy season on the Maghā day in the dark fortnight after the full moon of Prauṣṭhapada (i. e. Bhādrapada) has been declared. And thus he should offer (a festival like the Anvaṣṭakā ) to the pitṛs every month, observing uneven[^819] numbers. He should give food at least to nine (brāhmaṇas) or to any un-even number of brāhmaṇas. (Food should be given) to an even number on auspicious occasions[^820] or on the performance of meritorious deeds; to an uneven number on other occasions). The rite is performed from left to right. Barley grains are to be used instead of sesamum.

[^817]: अन्वष्टक्य is explained by रुद्रस्कन्द on खादिरगृह्य III. 5. as 'अष्टकामनु क्रियते इत्यन्वष्टक्यं कर्म एतच्च प्रत्यष्टकमनन्तरं कर्तव्यम्। and by देवपाल on काठकगृह्म 65.1 as 'अष्टकाया अनु पश्चाद्भवमन्वष्टक्यमित्यन्वर्थिकेयं संज्ञान्वष्टक्यमिति । एतच्च केचिदष्टकाया अङ्गं वदन्ति केचित्तत्सदृशं विकारभूतं कर्मान्तरम्।'

[^818]: The meat is that of the animal killed on the Aṣṭakā day (Asv. Gr. II. 4. 13).

[^819]: That is, selecting an uneven number of brāhmaṇas or on uneven _tithis_.

[^820]: 'Vṛddhi' or "Ābhyudayika" (referring to prosperity or good luck) Srāddha is performed on such occasions as the birth of a son, the marriage of a son or daughter, the pitṛs in the Vṛddhi-śrāddha being designated Nāndimukha. Pūrta means charitable works such as construction of wells and tanks, building of temples, dedication of parks. Vide H of Dh. vol. II. p. 844 n. 1992 and Yaj. I. 250, San. Gr. IV. 4. 1 ff.

The Anvaṣṭakya rite was performed after each of the three or four Aṣṭakās and if only one Aṣṭakā in Māgha were performed, then after the 8th of the dark half.

There are two views about the rite called Māghyāvarṣa[^821] in Āśv. Gr. II, 5.9. Acc. to Nārāyana, the rite is performed in the dark half of Bhādrapada for three days on 7th, 8th and 9th[^822]. The other view is that it is a rite like the Aṣṭakās but performed on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada, when generally the moon is in the Maghā _nakṣatra_. There is doubt about the very name of the rite, as the mss. present various forms (vide Oldenberg's note in S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 103 on Sān, Gr. III. 13. 1). The real name appears to be Māghyāvarṣa or Maghāvarşa (meaning 'a śrāddha in the rainy season when the moon is in the Maghā _nakşatra_)'. The Viṣṇu Dh, S. 76. 1[^823] mentions the following times for offering śrāddha viz, (twelve) Amāvāsyās (in a year), the three Aṣṭakās, the three Anvaṣṭakās, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada when the moon is in the Maghā asterism, the seasons of _śarad_ and _vasanta_. In Viṣṇu Dh. S. (78.52-53) also a śrāddha on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada is highly eulogised. Manu III. 273 also states that whatever food mixed with honey is offered on the 13th day in the rainy season when the moon is in Maghā procures endless satisfaction. To the same effect are Vas. XI, 40 (in the rainy season and on Maghā), Yaj. I. 26 and Varāhapurāṇa[^824].

[^821]: The word माध्यावर्ष (as an attribute of _Karma_ or Śrāddha) may be derived from मघावर्ष (मघायुक्तः वर्ष वर्षर्तुः) or वर्षमघा (or वर्षामघा meaning वर्षे मघा वर्षासु मघा). In the latter case the words are transposed on the analogy of राजदन्त (पा. II. 2.31). हरदत्त on आश्व. गृ. explains 'मघासु वर्षासंयोगाद माध्यावर्षमिति भवति तच्च त्रयोदश्याम् ' and then quotes या. I. 261.

[^822]: In the गृह्याग्निसागर of नारायणभट्ट आर्डे it is stated 'अथाष्टकाविकृतिभूतं माध्यावर्षश्राद्धं तत्र भाद्रपदापरपक्षे सप्तम्यादिषु त्रिष्वहःसु अष्टकाकर्मवत् सर्वे कुर्यादिति कारिका । हरदत्तस्तु भाद्रपदकृष्णपक्षे मघायुक्तत्रयोदश्यां माध्यावर्षाख्यं श्राद्धम् ।' folio 155 b (of the ms in the  BBRAS). Vide Cat. No 680 p. 215.

## Māghyāvarşa-śrāddha

In the Hir. Gr. II, 13. 3-4 (edited by Kirste) the name appears to be Mādhyāvarṣa[^825] and it is provided that meat is obligatory in it, but that if meat cannot be had then vegetables may be offered, In Pār,[^826] Gr. (III. 3) the name (as printed) is madhyāvarṣa which is said to be a 4th Aṣṭakā in which only vegetables are offered. Aparārka (p. 422) also appears to call the rite 'madhyāVarşa.' In the Bhavisyapurāņa[^827] (Brahma-parva), chap. 183. 4 also this rite is referred to but it is said that therein meat is to be offered. It appears probable that this ancient rite on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapads is a precursor of the Mahālayaśrāddha of later times.

If Āśvalāyana's view, viz. that there are four Aṣṭakās in _Hemanta_ and _Śiśira_, were followed and if the Māghyāvarṣa śrāddha were to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Bhādrapada as Nārāyaṇa holds, then there would be five Aṣṭakās in all. Bhattoji in his Caturvimsatimatasangraha says so[^828].

Considerations of space forbid the comparison of the above procedure from Āp. Gr. and Āśv. Gṛ. with the procedure described in the other Gṛhyasūtras. It should be noted that several of the sūtras often employ the same mantras in the various stages of the rite (ag pointed out above in notes 813-814).

It must be said that the Aṣṭakā śrāddhas gradually fell into oblivion and are not performed now.

[^825]: मातृदत्त on हिरण्य. गृ. explains 'माघ्यावर्षः प्रौष्ठपदो मासस्तत्र भवम्' i.e. he derives the name from मध्य and वर्ष (year), the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada being almost the middle of the year (when the year begins with चैत्र).

[^826]: मध्यावर्षे च तुरीया शाकाष्टका । पार. गृ. III. 3 (last sutra) in the Gujarathi Press edition.

[^827]: तिस्रोष्टकास्तु कर्तव्या मध्यावर्ता (मध्यावर्षा ?) चतुर्थिका । शाकपायसपूपैस्तु मांसेन तु चतुर्थिका॥ भविष्यपु. (I. 183.4).

[^828]: एवं भाद्रपदबहुलाष्टम्यप्यष्टका बोध्या । तथा च पद्मपुराणे-अग्निष्वात्तपितृकन्याया वसुनाम्ना पित्रा शप्तायाः पुनरनुगृहीतायाः भाद्रपदापरपक्षाष्टकाकालेनोत्पत्तिर्देशिता। प्रोष्ठपदाष्टका भूयः पितृलोके भविष्यति। आयुरारोग्यदा नित्यं सर्वकामफलप्रदा॥ इति । तदेवं पञ्चाष्टका हेमाद्यादिग्रन्थे स्थिताः। तत्रापि श्राद्धं नित्यम् । भट्टोजि on चतु.सं. P-1220 पद्मपुराण (सृष्टिखण्ड) chap. 9. 28-29 are: प्रौष्ठपद्यष्टका भूयः...स्वर्गकामफलप्रदा, हेमाद्रि on श्राद्ध p. 185 says 'अथ पूर्वोक्ताष्टकचतुष्टयव्यतिरिक्तापि भाद्रपदापरपक्षेऽष्टका । तस्याश्वेतिहासपूर्वकमुत्पत्तिः प्रशंसा चोच्यते पद्मपुराणे, and then he quotes eight verses from the पद्म of which प्रौष्ठपद्यष्टका is the last.

The foregoing discussion establishes that the monthly śrāddha on Amāvāsyā was the model śrāddha (_prakṛti_) of which the Aṣṭakās and other śrāddhas were copies (_vikṛtis_) with suitable modifications, though a few dissident texts reverse the position.

In the Gobhilagṛhya (IV. 4. 3 ff) another śrāddha called 'Anvāhārya' is prescribed after the Piṇḍapitṛyajña on the same day. The Sān. Gr. IV. 1. 13 appears also to describe the monthly śrāddha as distinct from the Piṇḍapitṛyajña. Manu (III.122-23) states: 'After performing the _Pitṛyajña_ (i. e, piṇḍapitṛyajña) a brāhmaṇa who keeps sacred fires shall offer every month on the amāvāsyā day the funeral sacrifice Piņdānvāhāryaka[^829]. The wise call the monthly offering to the Manes Anvāhārya and that must be carefully performed with the approved kinds of flesh mentioned below.' From this it appears that one who has consecrated the _śrauta_ fires (i.e. an _āhitāgni_) was to perform the _piṇḍapitṛyajña_ in the śrauta fires and also perform the same day another śrāddha after the piṇḍapitṛyajña, while those who had not consecrated _śrauta_ fires were to perform on amāvāsyā a śrāddha in the gṛhya fire, which was called piņdānvāhāryaka or simply anvāhārya and also were to offer piṇḍapitṛyajña in smārta fire (vide Sat. Śrauta II. 7. 64 'gṛhyāgnau anāhitāgneḥ'). From inquiries made I learn that nowadays most Agnihotrins (at least in the Deccan) do not perform Piṇḍapitṛyajña at all or perform it only once a year and that no one performs the Pindānvāhāryaka śrāddha. It is further to be noted that in smārta yajñas no one now sacrifices an animal but employs instead māşa grain and there are _āhitāgnis_ who do not offer meat in śrauta sacrifices also, but only _pişṭa-paśu_ (an effigy of an animal made of flour).

The literature on śrāddha is enormous in extent. From the Vedic Samhitās several thousand years ago up to medieval and modern commentaries and digests the various matters connected with śrāddha have been dealt with in more or less detail.

[^829]: मेधातिथि on मनु III. 122 explains: 'पिण्डानामनु पश्चादाह्रियतेऽनुष्ठीयते तत् पिण्डान्वाहार्यकं भवति', while सर्वज्ञनारायण explains 'पिण्डेभ्योल्पिकां मात्रामन्याहृत्य ब्राह्मणा अत्र श्राद्धे भोज्यन्ते इति पिण्डान्वाहार्यकम्।. These derivations are supported respectively by the पद्मपुराण, सृष्टि 9.88-89 'पितृयज्ञं तु निर्वर्त्य तर्पणाख्यं तु योग्निमान् । पिण्डान्वाहार्यकं कृत्वा श्राद्धकाले क्षये तदा॥ (कुर्याच्छ्राद्धमिन्दुक्षये तथा?) ' and by the मत्स्यपुराण 16. 43 यस्मादन्नोद्धृता मात्रा भक्षयन्ति द्विजातयः । अन्वाहार्यकमित्युक्तं तस्मात्तच्चन्द्रसंक्षये॥. The पद्मपुराण (सृष्टि 9, 119) further says 'एतदग्निमतां प्रोक्तमन्वाहार्ये च पार्वणम्।'. The कल्पतरु (on श्राद्ध p. 10) explains मनु III. 122 : पितृयज्ञोत्र पिण्डपितृयज्ञः। पिण्डान्वाहार्यकं पिण्डानामनु पश्चादाह्रियते क्रियते यद्दर्शश्राद्धं तत्तथा'॥ .

## Literature on Śrāddha

The Purāṇas contain thousands of verses on śrāddha, An adequate and thorough treatment of all this vast mass would fill a separate volume, but considerations of space forbid such an attempt here. All that can be attempted here at the most (and that too not in all cases) is to present matters chronologically i. e. describe how śrāddha was dealt with in the Samhitās and Brāhmaṇa texts, then in the comparatively older Gṛhya and Dharma sūtras, then in such early smftis as those of Manu and Yāj., then in some representative Purāṇas, then in the early commentaries of Medhātithi, Vijñānesvara and Aparārka, and then in the medieval digests. Even in this way only a skeleton of the ceremonies described in some representative work of each class can be exhibited. Many differences of detail which arose owing to lapse of time, the locality, the _śākhā_ and usages of each writer, his individual inclination and his ability, will have to be passed over altogether. In the days of the Purāṇas the differences in detail in the several śākhās have been adverted to[^829a]. Apart from the smṛtis and passages of the Mahābhārata (such as Anusāsana chap. 87-92) and commentaries on the Sūtras, on Manu, Yāj. and other smṛitis, the digests on śrāddha are legion. Only the following digests (arranged in chronological order) have been laid under contribution in this volume: Kalpataru on śrāddha; the Hāralatā and Pitṛdayitā of Aniruddha; the Smṛtyarthasāra; the Smṛticandrikā; the Caturvargacintamani (section on śrāddha) of Hemādri (which in the B. I. edition covers 1716 pages); the Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara; the Madanapārijāta ; the Śrāddhasāra (a part of Nrsimhaprasāda); Śrāddhakriya-kaumudi of Govindānanda ; the Śrāddhatattva of Raghunandana ; the Śrāddhasaukhya (part of Todarānanda); the Śrāddhakalpalatā of Vinayaka alias Nandapandita; the Nirṇayasindhu; the Śrāddhamayükha of Nilakantha; the Śrāddhaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); the Śrāddhacandrika of Divākarabhatta ; the Smrtimuktāphala (on śrāddha); the Dharmasindhu; the Bālambhatti, a commentary on the Mitākşarā. While presenting this exhaustive and heterogeneous material, some generalisations, when called for, will be made here and there. It will be seen later on how several minor matters such as whether food should be offered to gods before śrāddha, definitions of words like parivitti, vṛṣalipati increased the extent of treatises on śrāddha.

[^829a]: The स्कन्दपुराण (नागरखण्ड chap. 215. 24-25) says: दृश्यन्ते बहवो भेदाः द्विजान' श्राद्धकर्माणि। श्राद्धस्य बहवो भेदाः शाखाभेदैर्व्यवस्थिताः ॥

We should now turn to the several matters relating to šrāddhas.

First comes the question as to who are entitled to offer śrāddha (_śrāddhādhikārin_). This matter has been already dealt with in the H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 739 ff., and on page 763 and on pp. 256-261 (notes 581-588) above. It would be noticed that some (like the Viṣṇudharmasūtra ) prescribe that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased should offer _piṇḍas_ (i.e. perform śrāddha for him), while others said that whoever was preferable as entitled to offer piṇḍas to the deceased propositus was to take the wealth. A few matters not mentioned there may be added here. In the Santiparva 65, 13-21 it is narrated[^830] that emperor Māndhātṛ was told by Indra how Yavanas, Kirātas and similar non-Aryan peoples (that are styled Dasyus in the Epic) are to be made to conduct themselves and it is stated that all _dasyus_ may perform Pitṛyajñas (in which they should feed men of their own kind and make monetary gifts to them) and offer money to brāhmaṇas also. The Vāyupurāṇa (83. 112) also speaks of the Mlecchas as persons that offer oblations to _Pitṛs_. The general rule is stated by the Gobhilasmṛti[^831] that the husband should not offer piṇḍa to his wife even if she dies sonless, nor a father to his son nor an elder brother to a younger brother. The moral of the story of Nimi who performed śrāddha for his predeceased son and repented for having done so as it was _dharmasaṅkara_ is the same. Vide Anušāsanaparva 91. Aparārka (p. 538) quotes a verse from Ṣaţtrimśan-mata that a father should not perform the śrāddha of his son nor an elder brother of a younger one. But Bṛhatparāśara (p. 153) appears to state that even this general rule may have to be set aside sometimes. Baudhāyana and Vṛddhaśātātapa (q. by Sm. C, on śrāddha p. 337) allow a śrāddha (except sapiņdikaraṇa) to be performed by any one for any relative through affection, particularly at Gayā.

[^831]: न योषायाः पतिर्दद्यादपुत्राया अपि क्वचित् । न पुत्रस्य पिता चैव नानुजस्य तथाग्रजः॥ गोभिलस्मृति III. 70 and also II. 104; but see बृहत्पराशर V (p. 1537 'श्राद्धं पत्यापि कार्य स्यादपुत्रायास्तु योषितः। तस्यापि हि तथा कार्यमेकत्वं हि तयोर्यतः ॥ भ्रातुर्ज्येष्ठस्य कुर्वीत कार्य ज्येष्ठोऽनुजस्य च। देवहीनं तु तत् कुर्यादिति धर्मविदो विदुः॥. अपरार्क p. 538 quotes पित्रा श्राद्धं न कर्तव्यं पुत्राणां च कथंचन from षट्त्रिंशन्मत.

## Śrāddhādhikārin
Meaning of 'putra'

 It is emphasized[^832] that he alone deserves to be called _putra_, who, while the father is alive, obeys his words, and gives plenty of food (to brāhmaṇas) every year (after his father's death) and who offers piṇḍas (to his ancestors) at Gayā. The general rule laid down was that a child, whose _upanayana_ has not been performed, is like a südra and lacks authority to utter Vedic passages (vide Āp. Dh. S, II, 6. 15. 19, Gaut. II, 4-5, Vas. II. 6, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 28. 40. Manu II, 172)[^833]. But an exception was recognized by almost all these authorities that a son, though his upanayana may not have been performed, can repeat the Vedic _mantras_ required in funeral rites. Medhātithi on Manu II, 172 explains that a minor son, even though not initiated into Vedic study by upanayana, can offer water to his father, perform the navaśrāddhas (mentioned above in n. 593) and repeat such mantras as 'śundhantām pitaraḥ' required in these rites, but since he has no _śrauta_ or _gṛhya_ fire of his own he cannot perform such śrāddhas as the _pārvaṇa_. The Smṛtyarthasara (p. 56) provides that boys whose upanayana has not been performed, women and südras should get śrāddhas performed through a priest or they may themselves perform them without mantras but only mention the name and gotra of the deceased or with the two mantras 'devebhyo namaḥ' and 'pitṛbhyaḥ svadhā namaḥ'. The above discussion shows that men and women, adults as well as children, those who are _upanita_ as well as those that are _anupanīta_ are under an obligation to perform śrāddha.

Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I. 6.9 (which will be quoted later on) show that śrāddha was offered to three immediate ancestors, father, grand-father, great-grand-father. The Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5. 113-115) states that there is a group of seven persons closely knit together that is called _avibhaktadāya sapiṇḍas_ viz. great-grand-father, grand-father, father, the man himself (who offers piṇḍas to the preceding three), his full brothers, his son from a wife of the same caste, the grandson and great grandson; that sakulyas are those that are called 'vibhaktadāyādas', that the wealth of the deceased descends to those who are born of the body of the deceased[^834]. Manu IX. 137 (= Vas. 17,5 Viṣņu Dh. S. 15. 46 ) solemnly [^835] affirms: 'by (the birth of) a son a man wins the worlds (heaven &c.), he secures immortality by a grandson and by the grandson of a son he reaches the abode of the Sun'. This verse shows that all the three descendants of a person confer equally great spiritual benefit on him. Yāj. also (in 1. 78) lumps the three together (without making any distinction between them) when he says since a man secures perpetuation of lineage and heaven by means of son, grand-son and great-grand-son'. Therefore when Manu (IX. 106 ) says that by the birth of a son a man discharges his debt to his progenitors the Dāyabhāga (XI. 34) explains that the word _putra_ stands for the three descendants up to the great grandson, since all the three are entitled to perform the pārvaṇa-śrāddha and equally benefit the ancestors by the piṇḍas they offer, and that the word _putra_ is not to be taken literally but only as illustrative in order to include the great-grandson since one may with difficulty find a text expressly mentioning the _adhikāra_ of the grandson (as a performer of śrāddha and taker of wealth) but there is no text expressly mentioning the great-grandson separately (as the taker of wealth and giver of piṇḍa )[^836]. On Yāj. II. 50 which lays down that when the father dies or has gone to a distant country or is overwhelmed by calamities (incurable diseases or the like) his debts should be paid by the sons or grandsons, the Mit. adds that even when a son or grandson receives no ancestral property the father's debts must be paid, the only difference being that the son has to pay the principal as well as the interest, while the grandson has to return only the principal and has to pay no interest and the Mit. quotes a verse of Bṛhaspati[^837] where all the three descendants are mentioned in one breath and the Mit. adds that the great-grandson has not to pay even the principal if he has received no ancestral property.

The text printed in the आनन्दाश्रम collection of स्मृतिs is slightly different.

This last remark implies that the Mit, regarded that the great-grandson was also included in the extended sense of 'putra'. Yāj. II. 51 begins by saying that whoever takes the wealth of a deceased person has to pay the latter's debts, so the great-grandson would have to pay the great-grand-father's debts if he received the assets of the grand-father. Therefore the Mit. on II. 50 expressly mentions that a great-grandson need not pay his great-grand-father's debts if he received no assets, because, otherwise being included in the extended meaning of putra, he would have had to pay. There was no necessity to bring in or mention the _prapautra_ under II. 50 if the Mit. did not include the prapautra in the word putra. Again on Yāj. II. 51 ('putrahinasya rikthinaḥ') the Mit. included even _prapautra_ under the word _putra_. This shows that the Mit. is quite conscious that the three descendants of a man form one group and succeed to his estate and liabilities and putra includes three descendants wherever the context so requires. If the word 'putra' is not to be taken as only illustrative and as including both grandson and great-grandson, serious difficulties will arise even in the interpretation of Yaj. on which the Mit. comments. For example, in Yāj. II. 135-136 it is said that when a gonless man dies his wife, daughters and other heirs (named there ) succeed one after another. If ‘putra' is taken to mean only son' and no one else, then on the death of a man without a son his wife or daughter (whoever is alive ) will take the wealth even if a son's son exists. But that would be absurd and is not stated by any one. Therefore the word putra has to be interpreted in a wider sense in a proper context. Many works such as the Vyavahāramayukha, the Viramitrodaya, the Dattakamimāngā interpret the word 'putra' as including three generations. Therefore, though the Mit. in its remarks on inheritance and succession expressly names the son and grandson only (lit. it should have mentioned only the son) it must be taken as including the great-grandson also, particularly in view of the fact that it refers to the great-grandson in its comment on Yāj. I, 50 and 51 as taking the riktha which the Mit. (on Yāj. II, 114) interprets as aptratibandha dāya. Baud., Manu, Yājñavalkya speak of the three descendants and Śankhalikhita, Vas. XI. 39 and Yama employ[^838] only the word _putra_ or _suta_ in relation to the three ancestors. Therefore, the remark of Dr. Kapadia in 'Hindu Kinship'on p. 162 'Vijñāne śvara understands by the word putra sons and grandsons only' is unjustified. It is impossible to hold with Dr. Kapadia that the Mit. ran counter to the express dicta of renowned Smṛtis such as those of Manu, Śankha-Likhita and Puraṇas like the Viṣṇu-purāṇa III. 13,30 (quoted above in note 582) and that in its remarks on succession it forgot its own interpretation of putra on Yaj. II. 51. He has also not correctly understood the words of the Mit, introducing Yāj. II. 137: 'sons and grandsons take the wealth; in their absence, the wife and others; thus it is said (by me). This is wrong for several reasons. "Wife and others take the wealth' is said by Yāj. (in II. 135-36). The following words are 'now (the author) declares an exception to both.' This clearly refers to Yāj. (II. 137) and not to Vijñāne śyara and so 'uktam' also must refer to Yāj. and not to Vijñāneśvara. Therefore, according to the Mit, the great-grand son is included in the extended meaning of the word 'putra', is entitled just like a son or a grandson to offer śrāddha (in default of a son or grandson) and to take the wealth and pay the debts of the ancestor. In the matter of payment of debts there is, on account of the difference in the period that elapses, a difference between all the three descendants if no ancestral wealth is left by the ancestor, viz. the son pays the debt with interest, the grandson only the principal lent but without interest and the great-grandson nothing at all. This shows that even between the son and the grandson that are expressly mentioned by Yaj. II. 50 as to the payment of debts there is a difference and that as the great-grandson had to pay nothing when no ancestral property existed he was not mentioned at all in Yāj. II, 50.

Just as the king is an ultimate heir and also the guardian of all minors, so he is like the son of a person (who has no relatives left) for performing śrāddhas.

## Times for Śrāddhas

The next question is about the times when śrāddha is to be performed. It has been seen above (vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 696 ff) that long before the time of the Sat. Br. five daily observances (called Mahāyajñas) were prescribed for each house-holder, viz. the sacrifice to beings, that to men, that to the Fathers, that to the gods and that to Veda. The Sat. Br. and the Tai. Ā. (II. 10) say further that this daily rite in which one offers _svadhā_ (food) to the Fathers even up to water was called _pitṛyajña_, Manu III. 70 defines _pitṛyajña_ as _tarpaṇa_ (satiating ancestors with the offerings of water). Manu III. 82 provides that an householder should daily perform a śrāddha with food or with water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus please the Fathers. Śrāddha originally meant a sacrifice performed for the Fathers on Amāvāsyā (vide Gaut. 15.1-2)[^838a]. By applying that word to the daily oftering of water to the Manes what is intended to be conveyed is that the special characteristics of śrāddha in the strict sense are to be extended to this daily rite so far as possible. Amāvāsyā is of two kinds, Sinivāli and Kuhū. Those who keep śrauta fires should perform śrāddha on the former, while those who have not kept śrauta fires and südras should offer śrāddha on the latter.

Śrāddhas are divided into three classes, _nitya_, _naimittika_ and _kāmya_. An observance is called _nitya_ when it is laid down that it must be performed on a certain or fixed occasion (such as every day, on an amāvāsyā, or on Aşṭakā day). What is laid down for being done on an occasion which is uncertain is called _naimittika_ (such as the birth of a son). What is ordained to be done in case one desires a certain reward or fruit is called _kāmya_ (e.g. the performance of a śrāddha on Kṛttikā or Rohiņi by one who desires heaven or progeny ). The five daily _yajñas_ including pitṛ-yajña are _nitya_ i.e. they must be performed without any eye to any reward therefrom and the non-performance thereof will lead to sinfulness.

[^838a]: अथ श्राद्धम् । अमावास्यायां पितृभ्यो दद्यात्। गौ. 15. 1-2. दृष्टचन्दा सिनीवाली नष्टचन्द्रा कुहूस्तथा । तत्र साग्निकैः सिनीवाल्यां श्राद्धं कार्यमितरैः कुहाम् । तथा च व्यासः । दृष्टचन्द्रा सिनीवाली कार्याविप्रैस्तु साग्निकैः । नष्टचन्द्रा कुहूः कार्या शूद्रैर्विप्रैरनग्निकैः ॥ अपरार्क p. 417, स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 344). The स्कन्दपुराण (VI. 216.83) gives the following etymology of अमावास्या 'अमा नाम रवे रश्मिसहस्रप्रमुखः स्थितः । तस्मिन्वसति येनेन्दुरमावास्या ततः स्मृता.' The वायुपुराण (56.42) states 'अमा वसेतामृक्षे तु यदा चन्द्रदिवाकरौ। एका पञ्चदशीं रात्रिममावास्या ततः स्मृता॥'. अमा means सह or एकत्र.

Passages mentioning the rewards that follow from the performance of obligatory ( _nitya_ ) rites are only laudatory, they only convey that such performances make a man pure, but it is not meant that they are not obligatory and may be performed only if a person desires the rewards or results promised (i, e. such performances are not _kāmya_). Āp. Dh, S. (II. 7. 16. 4-7) provides certain times for the performance of śrāddha viz, that it must be performed in the latter half of every month, that the afternoon is preferable for it, that the last days of the latter half of each month are preferable to the first days of the latter half. Gaut, 15. 3 and Vas. XI. 16 say that śrāddha may be performed on any day of the dark half of a month after the 4th day and Gaut. 15. 5 adds that if particularly appropriate materials or particularly holy brāhmaṇas are available or the performer is near a very sacred place (such as Gaya) a śrāddha may be performed on any day. Kurma (II. 20. 23) says the same thing. The Agnipurāṇa 115. 8 says that at Gayā a śrāddha may be performed on any day (na kālādi Gayātirthe dadyāt piṇḍāṁśca nityaśaḥ). Manu (III, 276-278) provides that the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the 10th but excepting the 14th[^838b] are recommended for śrāddha, that one performing a śrāddha on even lunar days (i. e, on the 10th, 12th) and on the even nakṣatras (i. e. on Bharaṇi, Rohiņi &c.) gains the fulfilment of all his desires, that one who worships the Manes on uneven days (11th, 13th &c.) and on uneven constellations (Kr̥ttikā, Mr̥gaśiras &c.) obtains prosperous offspring and that just as the latter half of a month is preferable to the first half so the afternoon is preferable to the forenoon for the performance of a śrāddha.

[^838b]: About the 14th of the dark half या.I. 264 says 'प्रतिपत्प्रभृतिष्वेका वर्जयित्वा चतुर्दशीम् । शस्त्रेण तु हता ये वै तेभ्यस्तत्र प्रदीयते॥'; compare मनु III.276; and मरीचि states बिषशस्त्रश्वापदादितिर्यग्ब्राह्मणघातिनाम् । चतुर्दश्यां क्रिया कार्या अन्येषां तु विगर्हिता ॥ q. by स्मृतिच. (श्रा.) p. 367, श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 191. ब्राह्मणघातिनां here means ब्राह्मणकृतघातोस्यास्तीति. This only means that śrāddha should not be performed for anyone on the 14th of the dark half except for those who were killed by poison or by beasts, snakes, lower animals or brāhmaṇas or in battle. But a śrāddha may be performed on any tithi of the dark half for those killed in battle or by poison &c. It should be noted that Manu prescribes (III. 282) that an āhitāgni should not perform a śrāddha except on _darśa,_ from which it follows that only others (who had no śrauta fires) could offer śrāddha on any day of the dark half. Vide स्कन्दपुराण VI, 204, 24-27 and VI. 219.19-21 for the proposition that śrāddha should be performed on the 14th tithi of the dark half of Bhādrapada for those who met a violent death by poisoning or fire or were killed by animals having fangs or horns or who committed suicide.

Anušāsanaparva 87. 18 is the same as Manu III. 276. Yāj. (I. 217-218), the Kurma (II 20.2-8), Mārkaṇḍeya (28. 20 ff) and Varāhapurāņa 13. 33–35 sum up in one place the times for performing śrāddhas as follows: Amāvāsyā, the Aṣṭakā days, lucky days (such as the birth of a son), dark half of a month, the two _ayanas_ (the _two_ days on which the sun appears to start towards the south or north i. e. solstices), possession of sufficient materials (such as rice and pulse or meat), the arrival of a worthy brāhmaṇa, the equinoctial points (vişuvat, i.e. the sun's apparent entrance into Aries and Balance), the days on which the sun passes into one _rāśi_ from another, the astrological conjunctions called Vyatīpāta[^838c], Gajacchāyā, eclipses of the sun and the moon, when the performer has an intense desire to perform śrāddha-these are times for performing śrāddha.

[^838c]: अपरार्क p.426 quotes वृद्धमनु for defining व्यतीपात 'श्रवणाश्विधनिष्ठाद्रानागदेवतमस्तके। यद्यमा रविवारेण व्यतीपातः स उच्यते ॥'. Vide अग्निपु. 209, 13 for the same verse with slight variations (due probably to not reading the mss. correctly). When Amāvāsyā occurs on a Sunday and the moon is on that day either in Sravaṇa nakṣatra or in Aśvini, Dhaniṣṭhā, Ārdrā or the first quarter of Āśleṣā, that is a conjunction called व्यतीपात: some explain मस्तक as meaning मृगशिरोनक्षत्र. Bāṇa mentions Vyatīpatā in his हर्षचरित. व्यतीपात is also defined in another way with reference to Rāśis. पञ्चाननस्थौ गुरुभूमिपुत्रौ मेषे रविः स्याद्यदि शुक्लपक्षे । पाशाभिधाना करभेन युक्ता तिथिर्व्यतीपात इतीह योगः॥ q. by श्रा. क. ल. pp. 18-19. When on the 12th of the bright half the moon is in Hasta nakṣatra, the sun in Meṣa (Aries) and Jupiter and Mars in Lion, then the conjunction is called व्यतीपात. गजच्छाया is a conjunction that occurs when the moon is in Maghā nakṣatra and the sun is in Hasta and the tithi is 13th in the rainy season. विश्वरूप on या. II 218 quotes: यदि स्याच्चन्द्रमाः पित्र्ये करे चैव दिवाकरः । वर्षासु च त्रयोदश्यां सा च्छाया कुञ्जरस्य तु ॥. अपरार्क quotes a काठकश्रुति 'एतद्धि देवपितृणां चायनं यद्धस्तिच्छाया)". Both the मिता. and अपरार्क p. 427 have a similar verse. The कल्पतरु (श्रा.)p.9 and कृत्यरत्नाकर p.319 quote ब्रह्मपुराण 'योगो मघात्रयोदश्यां कुञ्जरछायसंश्रितः। भवेन्मघायां संस्थे च शशिन्यर्के करे स्थिते. The सौरपुराण (51.31-32) puts it as'श्राद्धपक्षे त्रयोदश्यां मघास्विन्दुः करे रविः'. The स्कन्दपुराण (VI. 220.42-44) explains हस्तिच्छाया in several ways. The आग्निपु. (165.3-4) explains हस्तिच्छाया in two ways. Some take गजच्छाया literally and say that śrāddha should be performed in the shadow of an elephant. The Vanaparva 200.121 avers that such a śrāddha in which the ears of the elephant serve as a fan gives gratification for thousands of कल्पs. अपरार्क P.427 quotes a verse from the महाभारत about श्राद्ध performed in the rainy season under the shadow of an elephant and fanned by the flapping of its ears and the meat being that of a goat all red in colour.

The Mārkaṇḍeya[^838d] (chap. 28. 22-23), adds that śrāddha should be performed when a man dreams an evil dream and when evil planets affect the nakṣatra of his birth. In an eclipse the appropriate time for śrāddha is what is called _Sparśa Kāla_[^839] (i.e. when the eclipse begins), as stated in a verse of Vṛddha-Vasiṣṭha. The Brahmapurāṇa (220. 51-54) contains all the times specified by Yāj. and a few more. Vide also Skandapurāņa VII, 1. 30-32, Viṣṇupurāņa TII, 14. 4-6, Padma (sṛṣti 9. 128-129). Acc. to Vişņu Dh. S. 76. 1-2, Amāvāsyā, the three Aṣṭakās and the three Anvaṣṭakās, the 13th day of the dark half of Bhādrapada on which the moon is in _Maghā_, _Śarad_ and _Vasanta_ are obligatory (_nitya_) times for śrāddha and that if a person does not perform śrāddha on these days he goes to Hell. Viṣṇu Dh, S. (77.1-7) states that the day of the sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac to another, the two equinoctial days, particularly the solsticial days, Vyatipāta, the constellation on which the performer is born, a time of rejoicing (son's birth or the like )--these are _kāmya_ times and a śrāddha performed on these occasions gives infinite pleasure (to the Manes). The Kūrmapurāņa (Uttarārdha 16. 6-8) says that śrāddhas called _kāmya_ are commended on eclipses, solstice days, equinoctial days and on Vyatipāta and they give infinite pleasure (to the Manes) and śrāddha performed on Saṅkrānti (sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac to another) is inexhaustible and so also on days of birth and on the several nakṣatras śrāddhas should be performed. Ap. Dh, S. II. 7. 16. 8-22, Anusāsana 87, Vāyu 89. 10-19, Yāj. I 262-263. Brahmapurāņa 220.15-21, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 78. 36-50, Kūrmapurāṇa (IL 20,19-22), Brahmāṇḍa III. 17.10-22 state what rewards a man gets if he performs śrāddhas on each of the days from the first to the 15th of the dark half. These lists do not completely agree with each other.

[^838d]: श्राद्धार्हद्रव्यसंप्राप्तौ तथा दुःस्वमदर्शने। जन्मर्क्षग्रहपीडासु श्राद्धं कुर्वीत वेच्छया ॥ मार्कण्डेय 28,22. A man can perform a śrāddha on any _tithi_ of the dark half of a month, but he should not perform it on a tithi when the moon is in the nakşatra on which he was born or in Pürvā-bhādrapadā or in Uttarābhādrapadā or Kṛttika, Ārdra, Āśleṣa or Mūla or in a _nakṣatra_, which is 5th, 14th or 23rd from the _nakṣatra_ of his birth.

[^839]: ग्रहणमुपरागः। तत्रापि स्पर्शकालो ग्राह्यः। त्रिदशाः स्पर्शसमये तृप्यन्ति पितरस्तथा। मनुष्या मध्यकाले तु मोक्षकाले तु राक्षसाः॥ इति वृद्धवसिष्ठस्मरणात्। भट्टोजि on चतु. सं. p. 124; स्मृतिच. (श्रा) p. 342 quotes the verse,

## Śrāddhas on several tithis

That of Āp. being probably the most ancient, is set out here:-Śrāddha performed on each of the 15 days of the dark half respectively yields the following results in order, viz. progeny chiefly consisting of females (on 1st tithi of dark half), sons that will be thieves, sons that will be possessed of Vedic learning and the performance of Veda-vratas, son that will own small domestic animals, many sons that will be distinguished (by their learning) and the performer will not die childless, a great traveller and gambler (on the 6th), success in agriculture (on 7th), prosperity (on 8th), one-hoofed animals (on 9th), success in trade (10th day), black iron and tin and lead (on 11th), son possessed of cattle (on 12th), many sons and many friends and handsome children which will die young (13th tithi), success in arms (14th), prosperity (on 15th i. e. Amāyāsyā). Gārgya (q. by Par. M. I. 2 p. 324) provides that one should not perform śrāddha on Nandā, on Friday, on 13th of the dark half and on the nakşatra of birth and the preceding and the following naksatras for fear of losing one's sons and wealth. The Nandā tithis are 1st, 6th and 11th. The Anušāsana-parva (87.16) provides that he who performs śrāddha on the 13th tithi attains pre-eminence among his agnates, but then the young men in his house die as a consequence.

The śrāddhas performed on the days mentioned in Viṣṇu Dh, S. 77.1-6 are _naimittika_ and those performed on certain _tithis_ and days of the week for securing certain rewards would be _kāmya_ śrāddhas. According to Par. M. I. 1 p. 63 the performance of obligatory (nitya) actions is samskāraka (i.e. effects a purifying change in the mind making it fit for higher things ), while in some cases it may also produce the desire to know the Reality behind the appearances (i. e. it is 'vividiṣājanaka' as indicated by the Gitā 9. 27). Jaimini (VI. 3.1-7) establishes the proposition that the _nitya_ acts (such as Agnihotra, Darśa-pürņamāsa-yāga ) must be performed even though the performer is unable to perform a subsidiary part of the rite; while Jai. VI. 3. 8-10 provide that every part of _kāmya_ actions must be performed and if the performer thinks that he would be unable to perform all he should not undertake to perform a kāmya rite at all[^839a].

[^839a]: This position is stated by the परा. मा. I part 1 p.170 : 'यदा कृत्स्नाङ्गानुष्ठानशक्तिस्तदैव काम्यमनुष्ठेयम्,' The विष्णुपुराण (III. 14.4-8) sets out the times for काम्यश्राद्ध. The two propositions of जैमिनि are often spoken of as यथाशक्तिन्याय and सर्वाङ्गोपसंहारन्याय.

The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (78.1-7) states that one performing śrāddha on Sunday secures everlasting freedom from disease and those who perform śrāddha on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (Jaiva ), Friday and Saturday respectively secure happiness (or admiration by people ), victory in battle, all desires, such learning as he desires, wealth and long life. The Kūrma (II. 20, 16-17) also expatiates on the rewards for śrāddhas on the several days of the week.

The Viṣṇu-Dharmasūtra (78. 8-15 ) mentions what rewards follow from performance of śrāddhas on the 28 naksatras from Krttikā to Bharaṇi (including Abhijit which is placed after Uttarāsādhā and before Sravana). Yāj. I. 265-268, Vāyu chap. 82, Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa 30, 8-16, Kūrma (II, 20. 9-15), Brahmapurāņa 220, 33-42, Brahmāṇḍa ( Upodghātapāda 18.1 ff) also deal with the same topic, but all these works do not present complete agreement. For example, Viṣṇu Dh. S. and Yāj. agree that śrāddha performed on Křttikā, Rohiņi, Aśvini and Bharani yield as rewards heaven, offspring, horses and longevity, but they disagree in several others e. g. while Viṣṇu says that prosperity, beauty (or happiness ) and all desires are obtained by performing śrāddha on the Puṣya, Aśleşā and Maghā nakşatras respectively, Yāj. provides that a śrāddha on these three yields strength, son and eminence. The Anuśāsanaparva 89 and Vayupurāņa 82 set out the rewards of śrāddhas on the several nakşatras from Krttikā as declared by Yama to Śaśabindu.

## Yugādi and Manvādi tithis

It is stated in the Agnipurāņa[^840] that śrāddhas performed at a holy place and on days that are called Yugādi and Manvādi yield inexhaustible gratification (to the _pitṛs_). The Viṣṇupurāṇa[^841], Matsyapurāṇa (17. 4-5), Padma V. 9. 130-131, Varāhapurāṇa and Prajāpati-smṛti verse 22 and Skanda VII, 1. 205, 33-34 state that the third tithi of Vaiśākha (bright half), the 9th of the bright half of Kārtika, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada and 15th tithi of the dark half of Māgha are called _Yugādi tithis_ (i.e. the first days of the four _Yugas_ from _Kṛta_).

[^841]: वैशाखमासस्य तु या तृतीया नवम्यसौ कार्तिकशुद्धपक्षे । नभस्यमासस्य तमिस्रपक्षे त्रयोदशी पञ्चदशी च माघे॥ एता युगाद्याः कथिताः पुराणैरनन्तपुण्यास्तिथयश्वतसः। विष्णपुराण III. 14. 12-13 q. by स्मृतिच. I. pp. 58-59, कृत्यरत्नाकर p. 542, मद. पा. 2.538. अपरार्क (p. 425) quotes the विष्णुपुराण differently. The मत्स्यपुराण (17.4) and पद्म place 15th of माघ before the 13th of भाद्रपद. Vide अग्निपु. 209 14-15 for some different dates for युगादि. The स्मृत्यर्थसार (p.9) gives a different order : शुक्लतृतीया वैशाखे प्रेतपक्षे त्रयोदशी कार्तिके नवमी शुक्ला माघे दर्शश्च पूर्णिमा। एता युगादयः प्रोक्ता दत्तस्याक्षयकारकाः॥. The वराहपुराण (13. 40-41) contains the verse वैशाखमासस्य ०. प्रजापतिस्मृति (22) has a similar verse for युगादि days.

Matsya 17. 6-8, Agnipurāṇa 117. 61-64 and 209.16-18, Saurapurāṇa 51. 33-36, Padmapurāṇa (Sṛṣṭi 9. 132-135 ) mention the first tithis of the 14 Manus (or Manyantaras) as follows: 9th of the bright half of Āśvina, 12th of the bright half of Kārtika, the third of the bright half of Caitra and of Bhādrapada, the amāvāsyā of Fālguna, the 11th of the bright half of Pauṣa, 10th of bright half of Āşādha and the 7th of the bright half of Māgha, the 8th of the dark half of Srāvana, the Full Moon of Āsādha, Kārtika, Fālguna, Caitra and Jyeṣṭha. The Matsyapurāṇa list is quoted in the Sm. C. I. p. 58, Kṛtyaratnākara p. 543, Par, M. 1 1. p. 156 and I. 2 p. 311, and the Madanapārijāta p. 540. The orders in the Skandapurāṇa VII. 1. 205, 36-39 and the Smrtyarthasāra (p. 9) are slightly different. In the Skandapurāņa (Nāgarakhaṇḍa) the first tithis of thirty kalpas from Śveta onwards are specified as fit for śrāddha, but are passed over here.

Ap. Dh. S. II.[^842] 7. 17. 23-25, Manu III, 280, Viṣņu Dh. S. 777.8-9, Kūrma (II. 16. 3-4), Brahmāṇḍa III. 14. 3, Bhaviṣya I. 185. 1 forbid the performance of śrāddha at night or at twilight or when the sun has just risen except in the case of an eclipse of the moon. Āp. adds that when once a śrāddha is begun in the afternoon and owing to some cause there is delay and the sun sets then the performer should perform the remaining rites the next day and he should observe a fast till the placing of the _piṇḍas_ on the _darbhas_. Viṣņu Dh. S. declares that śrāddha performed during an eclipse satisfies the Manes as long as the moon and stars exist and brings to the performer all advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires, while the Kūrmapurāņa threatens that he who would not perform a śrāddha in an eclipse sinks (incurs sins or becomes ruined) as a cow in mud. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 217 is careful to point ont that though there is a prohibition against eating during the progress of an eclipse of the sun or moon, that prohibition would only affect the eater (the brāhmaṇa who eats śrāddha repast in an eclipse) but not the giver who will secure happiness (or good results ) thereby[^843].

Very learned disquisitions are held in Aparārka p. 465 ff, Hemādri p. 313 ff and other writers and digests as to the mean ing of _aparāhṇa_ which is the time for śrāddha prescribed by Manu (III. 278). There are several views. Some hold that the part of the day after noon is 'after-noon.' The word 'pūrvāhṇa' occurs in Ṛg. X. 34. 11. Others relying on a śruti[^844] text 'The forenoon is for gods, mid-day for men and afternoon for pitṛs' hold that the third part of the day divided into three parts is 'aparāhṇa.' A third view is that aparāhṇa is the 4th part of the day divided into five parts and they rely [^845] on Sat. Br. II. 2.3.9. The five parts are called _prātaḥ_, _saṅgava_, _madhyandina_ (or madhyāhna), _aparāhṇa_ and _sāyāhna_ (or sāyam or astagamana). The first three are expressly mentioned even in the Ṛg.eda V. 76. 3. Prajāpati-snirti (verses 156-157) says that each of these five parts extends over three _muhurtas_ (the day being divided into fifteen muhūrtas). It further states that _kutapa_ is the 8th muhūrta from sunrise and that śrāddha should be begun in _kutapa_ and should not last beyond Rauhiṇa muhūrta and that five muhūrtas (from 8th to 12th) are the maximum time for śrāddha[^846].

Compare पद्म (सृष्टिखण्ड 11.91-92) and स्कन्द VII.1 205.6 for similar verses. The names of the 15 मुहूर्तs are quoted in टोडरानन्द (on श्रा. folio 25a ) and in बृहयोगयात्रा of वराहमिहिर (VI. 2-4) m. in my paper on 'Varahamihira and Utpala,' JBBRAS vol., 24-25 p. 21.

## Meanings of 'kutapa'

The word kutapa has eight meanings as noted by the Sm. c. (śrāddha) p. 433 and Hemādri on śrāddha p. 320. The word is derived from ku' meaning 'condemned' (i.e.sin) and 'tapa' means 'what burns.' The eight[^847] meanings of 'kutapa' are 'midday, a vessel of rhinoceros horn, woollen seat or blanket from Nepal, silver, darbhas, sesame, cows and daughter's son.' The general rule is that śrāddhas are performed in the afternoon (but this applies to śrāddha on New moon, Mahālaya, Aṣṭakā and Anvaṣṭakā śrāddhas ), while Vṛddhiśrāddha and śrāddha in which only corn is offered (āmaśrāddha) are performed in the morning. Medhātithi on Manu III. 245 quotes a smṛti text on this[^848]. The Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana (II. 150, 162) provides that when it is not possible to perform a religious rite at the time prescribed for it as appropriate, it should be performed at some other time thereafter and that, between the proper time of a rite and the means, the former is to be preferred and one should not wait for a time later than the proper one with the desire of being able to collect all the principal materials[^848a].

A few words must be said about the proper places for the performance of a śrāddha. Manu (III, 206-207 ) lays down that the performer should make efforts to secure a spot sloping to the south and smear it with cow dung, a spot that is pure and unfrequented by many persons) and that the Fathers are pleased by śrāddha at naturally clean spots or the banks of rivers and spots that are unfrequented. Yāj. I. 227 very briefly puts the requirements by saying that the place of śrāddha should be covered on all sides, should be pure and sloping to the south. Śaṅkha says :[^849] one should not perform śrāddha on the backs of bulls, elephants and horses, nor on raised earth platforms nor on land owned by others.' The Kūrmapurāņa states [^850] 'Forests. sacred mountains, holy places, temples-these have no (definite) owner and they cannot be private property (of any one )'. Yama provides[^851] if one offers śrāddha to his _pitṛs_ in spots belonging to others, that śrāddha rite is destroyed by the _pitṛs_ of the owner of those spots.

Therefore, a man should perform śrāddha on holy spots, on river banks, in sacred places and particularly in land belonging to himself, in bowers near hills and on mountain tops.' The Viṣṇudharma-sūtra chap. 85 mentions numerous holy places and then adds in these and other _tirthas_, big rivers, on all natural sandy banks, near streams, on mountains, in bowers, forests, groves and spots that look charming because of being smeared with cowdung ( śrāddha may be performed ).' Śaṅkha (14. 27–29 ) states 'whatever is given in holy Gayā, in Prabhāsa, Puşkara, Prayāga, in the Naimiṣa forest (on the Sarasvati), on the banks of the Ganges, Yamunā, Payoṣṇi, on Amarakaṇṭaka, on Narmadā, in Benares, in Kurukṣetra, Bhṛgutunga, on the Himalaya, on Sapta-Veni, on Ṛşikūpa--all that becomes inexhaustible.' The Brahmapurāṇa ( 220.5-7) also specifies river banks, lakes, mountain tops, sacred spots like Puṣkara as the proper places for śrāddha. The Vāyupurāṇa, chap. 77 and Matsya 22 contain long lists of sacred places, countries, mountains in relation to śrāddhas. The Kalpataru (śrāddha p. 40) and Sr. P. p. 147 state that special characteristics of the tirthas in the several countries that are declared to be fit places for śrāddha should be understood from the inhabitants of those various countries.

Sacred places will be dealt with in a separate section (on _tirthas_ ).

##Countries not fit for śrāddha

The Viṣṇudharmasūtra[^852] ( chap. 84 ) prescribes that śrāddha should not be performed in Mleccha country, nor should one go to a Mleccha country and then defines a Mleccha country as one in which the system of the four _varṇas_ is not established and states that Āryāvarta is beyond that. The Vāyupurāṇa provides[^853] that the country of Triśaṅku which is twelve _yojanas_ in extent and which is to the north of the river Mahānadi and to the south of Kikata (i. e. Magadha ) is not fit for śrāddha; similarly the countries called Kāraskara, Kaliṅga, the country to the north of the river Sindhu and all countries where the system of _varṇas_ and _āśramas_ is not in existence should be sedulously avoided for śrāddhas, The Brahmapurāṇa (220.8-10) makes the somewhat startling remark that the following countries should be avoided for śrāddhas viz, the Kirāta country, Kaliṅga, Koṅkaṇa, Krimi (Krivi?), Daśārņa, Kumārya (Cape Comorin), Taṅgaṇa, Kratha, the northern banks of the Sindhu river and the south bank of Narmadā and the east of the Karatoyā.

Vide also विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 141. 2-4.

The Mārkaṇḍeyapurāņa[^854] prescribes that for a śrāddha a place (ground) that is full of insects, that is arid, or is burnt by fire, from which proceed sounds that are painful to the ear, that is terrific in its aspect, that emits fetid smell should be avoided.

It was also provided from very early times that certain persons and animals are to be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be performed and are not to be allowed to pollute the śrāddha rite by looking at it or by disturbing it in various other ways. Gaut. (15. 25-28) provides that food seen by dogs, cāṇḍālas and those guilty of mahāpātakas becomes unclean (and so unfit); therefore one should offer śrāddha in a covered (or screened) place; or he should strew round about the place sesame or a worthy brāhmaṇa who purifies a row of diners by his presence should perform a śānti for removing the taint caused (by a dog or cāņdāla seeing the food &c). Ap. Dh. S, prescribes that the learned condemn the seeing of a śrāddha by dogs and those who (being _patita_) are excommunicated and that a leper, a bald man, one having sexual intercourse with another's wife, the son of a brāhmaņa who follows the profession of arms, the son of a brāhmaṇa woman from a südra man if these eat śrāddha food they pollute the diners sitting to eat in a row. Manu (III. 239-242) states: a cāṇḍāla, a village pig or cock, a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, an impotent person-these should not be allowed to see brāhmaṇas engaged in taking dinner.

[^854]: वर्ज्या जन्तुमती रूक्षा क्षितिः फ्लुष्टा तथाग्निना। अनिष्टदुष्ट शब्दोग्रा दर्गन्धा श्राद्धकर्मणि ॥ मार्कण्डेयपुराण 29.19 g. by श्राद्धप्र. p. 139.

Whatever is seen by these at a _homa_(agnihotra), at a gift (of cows and gold), when brāhmaṇas are being fed, or at a religious rite (like the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifice) or at a śrāddha becomes fruitless. A pig taints food ( offered to gods or Manes) by merely smelling it, a cock by setting in motion the air with its wings, a dog by casting a glance and a man of low caste by touch. If a servant of even the person who offers śrāddha is lame or squint-eyed or has a limb loss or more (i.e. having eleven or nine fingers &c.), he should be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be performed.' It is provided by the Anušāsanaparva (127.13) that śrāddha food should not be seen by a woman in her monthly illness or by a sonless woman or by one suffering from white leprosy. Viṣṇu-dharmasutra (82, 3 ff) contains a long list of about 30 persons who are not to be allowed near a śrāddha. The Kūrmapurāņa (II. 22. 34-35 ) states that one devoid of a limb, a _patita_, a leper, one suffering from an open ulcer, an atheist, a cock, a pig, a dog, should be kept far away from a śrāddha; one should also avoid one that has a disgusting appearance, an impure person, one who is naked, a mad man, a gambler, a woman in her monthly course, those that wear indigo-coloured or yellow-red garments and those who follow heretical views. The Mārkaṇḍeya 32. 20-24, Vāyu 78. 26-40, Viṣṇupurāṇa III. 16. 12-14 and Anušāsanaparva 91. 43-44 also contain long lists which are passed over here. The Skandapurāņa VI. 217. 43 also speaks about a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, a _patita_ and a hog not being allowed to see the śrāddha rite.

                                      The classification of Śrāddhas.

Śrāddhas have been variously classified. One classification, viz. into _nitya_, _naimittika_ and _kāmya_ has already been described above (p. 369). Another classification is that into Ekoddiṣṭa and Pārvaṇa[^855]. The first is offered to one deceased person alone, while the latter is performed on the amāvāsyā of a month or in the dark half of Bhādrapada or on saṅkrānti and in it the three paternal ancestors are principally invoked.

[^855]: Vide H. of Dh, vol. III. p. 737, note 1425 for explanation of these two. अमावास्यां यत् क्रियते तत्पार्वणमुदाहृतम्। क्रियते वा पर्वणि यत्तत्पार्वणमिति स्थितिः॥ भविष्यपुराण I. 183.15 q. by कल्पतरु p. 7, श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 192, श्रा. वि. of रुद्रधर, श्रा. क्रि. कौ. p. 6 (which explains 'पर्वाणि अन्वष्टका माघीपौर्णमास्यादि). The परा. मा. I. 2. p. 199 says पुरुषत्रयमुद्दिश्य यत्क्रियते तत्पार्वणम्। एकपुरुषोद्देशेन यत्क्रियते तदेकोद्दिष्टम्'. Venk, ed. of भविष्य reads दर्शे वा क्रियते यत्तु।.

Bṛhaspati quoted in the Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara mentions five classes of Śrāddhas as declared by Manu viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, Vṛddhi and Pārvaṇa[^856]. The Śrāddhaviveka remarks that the sixteen _pretašrāddhas_ (to be described later on) are included under naimittika and that such śrāddhas as Goṣṭhiśrāddha enumerated in other smṛtis are included in Pārvaṇa. The Kurmapurāṇa (II. 20.26) similarly speaks of the five śrāddhas as enumerated by Manu[^857]. The Mit on Yãj. I. 217 states that there are five śrāddhas, viz. "ahar-ahaḥ-śrāddha, pārvaṇa, vṛddhiśrāddha, ekoddiṣṭa and sapiṇḍikaraṇa. The daily śrāddha is described by Manu III.82 ( Śaṇkha 13.16 and Matsya 16.4) as one that is performed every day with food (cooked rice, yavas &c.) or with water or with milk, fruits and roots. Two verses of Viśvāmitra[^858] quoted by several works speak of twelve kinds of śrāddhas, viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, vṛddhi-śrāddha (performed on the birth of a son, marriage or similar incident of good luck), sapiṇḍana (sapiṇḍi karaṇa), pārvaṇa, goṣṭhiśrāddha, suddhiśrāddha, karmānga, daivika, yātrāśrāddha, puṣṭiśrāddha. Explanations of all these are quoted from the Bhavisyapurāņa by the same works. Sapiṇḍana and Pārvaṇa will be described below. Some of the rest not already defined may be briefly explained as follows: The Gosthi-śrāddha[^859] is one which is performed when a man becomes enthusiastic owing to a talk about śrāddha or when many learned men gather together at a sacred place and, finding it impossible to have separate cooking arrangements for each, pool their resources for collecting śrāddha materials and perform simultaneously śrāddha for the pleasure it affords to themselves and for the gratification of pitṛs.

The कल्पतरु explains: गोष्ठी चात्र श्राद्धकर्तृसमुदायः । संपत्सुखार्थ श्राद्धसामग्रीसम्पदा यत्सुखं तदर्थे बहूनां विदुषां केनचिन्निमित्तेन युगपच्छाद्धे कर्तव्य उपस्थिते पृथक्पाकाद्यसम्पत्तौ सम्भूय श्राद्धसामग्रीसंपादनेन यच्छ्राद्धं क्रियते तद्गोष्ठीश्राद्धमिति शङ्खधरः ।। (p. 7). The षण्णवतिश्राद्धप्रयोग of रघुनाथ gives another explanation 'श्राद्धस्य गोष्ठयां वार्तायां क्रियमाणायां तज्जनितोत्साहेन यत् क्रियते श्राद्धम् ।'.

The Śuddhiśrāddha is one where brāhmaṇas are fed when a person undergoes _śuddhi_ ( purification) after being guilty of some sin or transgression (it is a subsidiary act in a prāyaścitta). That śrāddha is called 'karmānga' which is performed at the time of the _Garbhādhāna_ rite or at the performance of a soma sacrifice, or at simantonnayana, puṁsavana (it is like Vr̥ddhiśrāddha ). That is called daivika śrāddha which is intended to propitiate gods ( it is like nityaśrāddha and is performed on the 7th or 12th _tithi_ or the like with sacrificial food). When a man going to a distant country on a pilgrimage or the like performs a śrāddha in which clarified butter is served ( to brāhmaṇas ) in abundance or when he comes back to his house, that is yātrāśrāddha. That is called puṣṭiśrāddha which is performed for the health (or fattening ) of the body (when taking some medicine for the purpose ) or for the increase of one's wealth. Out of these[^860] twelve the principal ones are _pārvaṇa_, _ekoddişṭa_, _vr̥ddhi_ and sapiṇḍana. There are works called Şaṇ-ṇavati-śrāddha such as those of Śivabhatta, son of Govinda, and of Raghunātha. The 96 śrāddhas to be performed in a year are briefly enumerated in a verse[^861] quoted in the note. They are: 12 śrāddhas on the 12 amāvāsyās in the year, the four śrāddhas on the Yugādi days (note 841 above), the fourteen śrāddhas on the Manvantarādi days (p. 375 above), the śrāddhas on 12 _saṅkrāntis_ (i. e. the sun's apparent motion from one sign of the Zodiac to another), the 13 śrāddhas on the Yoga called Dhr̥ti (i. e. Vaidhr̥ti) and the 13 śrāddhas on the Vyatipāta yoga, the 16 Mahalaya śrāddhas, the four Anvaṣṭakā days (according to Ašv. as noted on pp. 359-360), the four Aṣṭakā days and the four days (i.e. 7th of dark half of the months of Hemanta and Śiśira) of the day previous (to the Aṣṭakā).

I, 183. 15-19, q. by स्मृतिच (श्रा.) p. 334, श्रा. क.ल. p. 7. निर्णयसिन्धु p. 374. There are some various readings here that are not noted. The printed text (Venk. ed.) presents different readings, such as a गोभ्यश्च क्रियते श्राद्धं and क्रियते देवमुद्दिश्य सप्तम्यादिषु यत्नतः. These 12 श्राद्धs are defined in स्कन्दपुराण VII. 1. 205. 43-50 also. On दैविकश्राद्ध the टोडरानन्द (श्राद्धसौख्य folio 4 b) remarks 'अत्र यद्यपि प्रकृतं श्राद्धमसम्भवि देवोद्देश्यकत्वेन विधानात् तथापि श्रद्धया कार्यं श्राद्धमिति योगसामान्यात् श्राद्धपदाभिधेयतावचनं बोद्धव्यम्।'.

[^861]: अमा युगमनक्रान्तिधृतिपातमहालयाः । आन्वष्टक्यं च पूर्वेद्युः षण्णवत्यः प्रकीर्तिताः । verse 5 of षण्णवतिश्राद्ध of शिवभट्ट (Ms. in Bhadkamkar collection). The महालयs are 16 as stated by शाट्यायनि and देवल q. by परा.मा. I. 2 p. 319 and by स्मृ. मु. (श्राद्ध) p. 745; नभस्यस्यापरे पक्षे तिथिषोडशकं तु यत् । कन्यास्थार्कान्वितं चेत् स्यात्स कालः श्राद्धकर्मणि ॥ (शा.); अहःषोडशकं यत्तु शुक्लप्रतिपदा सह । चन्द्रक्षयविशेषेण सापि दर्शांत्मिका स्मृता॥ (देवल). Generally there are 13 वैधृतियोगs and 13 vyatipāta yogas in a year, though sometimes there may be 14 of each. There are in a month 27 yogas beginning from विष्कम्भ. The शतपथब्रा (VI.4. 2. 10) speaks of 12 अष्टकाs 'द्वादश पौर्णमास्यो द्वादशाष्टका द्वादशामावास्याः'.

These classifications and enumerations of śrāddhas will afford an idea how the doctrine of śrāddhas was carried to an exaggerated extent in the course of centuries. It goes without saying that only a few people could have indulged in the luxury of so many śrāddhas a year and most people were content with the performance of only one Mahālayaśrāddha and one or two more. It may be noted that Manu (III. 122) first prescribed that on the amāvāsyā of each month an elaborate śrāddha should be performed, but knowing that this was almost impossible Manu recommends to all (III. 281) that an elaborate śrāddha should be performed on three amāvāsyās in one year[^862] (viz. in Hemanta, Grīṣma and Varșā ) and one should perform every day the śrāddha which is one of the five daily sacrifices (III. 82-83). Devala went further and recommended that an elaborate śrāddha may be performed only once a year.

[^862]: एतेन विधिना श्राद्धं कुर्यात्संवत्सरं सकृत् । त्रिश्चतुर्वा यथाश्राद्धं मासे मासे दिने दिने । देवल q. by स्मृतिच (श्रा) p. 497 which explains: एतेन विधिना पार्वणविधिना प्रतिसंवत्सरमेकवारं विशिष्टेऽह्नि प्रतिसंवत्सरं त्रिवारं वा. कल्पतरु p. 22 (श्राद्ध) quotes the verse.

## Who should be invited at śrāddha

The next important question is about the qualifications of the brāhmaṇas that were invited to dinner on a śrāddha day. Only brāhmaṇas were and are entitled to be invited for śrāddha dinner whoever may be the performer of the śrāddha. In this connection many works contain high eulogies of brāhmaṇas, but they are passed over here, as the eulogy of brāhmaṇas has been already dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 37-38, 135-138. It may be noted that the gṛhyasūtras contain a few requirements, but as we proceed the smṛtis and purāṇas go on adding qualifications and enlarging the lists of those that should not be invited. For example, the Āśv. Gr.[^862a] IV. 7.2, San, Gr. IV.1. 2, Ấp, G. VIII. 21. 2, Ấp. Dh, S, II, 7. 17. 4, Hir. Gr. II, 10.2, Baud. Gr. II. 10. 5-6 and II. 8. 2-3, Gaut. 15.9 provide that the _brāhmaṇas_ to be invited should be possessed of Vedic learning, should be of excellent character (free from anger and passion and possessed of control of mind and senses) and of meritorious conduct, pure, not deficient in a limb or not having an excessive limb (e. g. having six fingers). The Ap. Dh. S. states that he who has studied the three Vedic verses in which the word 'madhu' occurs (Ṛg. I. 90.6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27-29. Tai, S. IV. 2.9.3), he who has studied the Trisuparṇa, one who is a Triņāciketa, one who has studied the mantras required for the four sacrifices (Aśvamedha, Puruşamedha, Sarvamedha and Pitṛmedha ) or who has performed these four sacrifices, one who keeps the five fires, he who knows the Sāman called Jyeṣṭha, he who carries out the duty of daily Vedic study, the son of one who has studied the Veda and is able to teach the whole Veda with its _aṅgas_, a _śrotriya_--these persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral repast.

[^862a]: ब्राह्मणान् श्रुतशीलवृत्तसंपन्नानेकेन वा । आश्च. गृ. IV.7.2; ब्राह्मणान् शुचीन मन्त्रवतः समङ्गानयुज आमन्त्रयते । योनिगोत्रासम्बन्धान् । नार्थापेक्षो भोजयेत् । हिर गृ. II. 10.2; त्रिमधुस्त्रिसुपर्णस्त्रिणाचिकेतश्चतुर्मेधः पञ्चाग्निज्येष्ठसामिको वेदाध्याय्यनूचानपुत्रः श्रोत्रिय इत्येते श्राद्धे भुञ्जानाः पङ्क्तिपावना भवन्ति । आप.ध. II. 7. 17-22. त्रिसुपर्ण is the name applied, according to Haradatta, to the three anuvākas beginning with ब्रह्ममेतु माम् (ते. आ. x. 48-50) or to the verse चतुःशिखण्डा युवतिः सुपेशाः in ते. बा. I. 2. 1.27 or Ṛg. x. 114. 3-5. त्रिणाचिकेतः is explained in different ways viz. (1) one who knows the Nāciketa fire, (2) a person who has thrice kindled the Nāciketa fire, (3) a person who has studied the Anuvāka called Virajas. For the Nāciketa fire, vide Kaṭhopaniṣad 1. 1. 16-18. The word 'Triṇāciketaḥ' occurs in Kaṭha Up. I. 1. 17 and is explained by शङ्कर as 'त्रिःकृत्वा नाचिकेतोऽग्निश्चितो येन सः त्रिणाचिकेतास्तद्विज्ञानस्तदध्ययनस्तदनुष्ठानवान् वा ।. Tai. Br. (III. 11.7-8) describes the नाचिकेत fire and the story of Naciketas. The five fires are Gārhapatya, Āhavaniya, Dakṣināgni, Āvasathya (or aupāsana) and Sabhya, Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 679. Vide _ibid_. II. p. 767 note 1838a for explanations of पङ्क्तिपावन, ज्येष्ठसामिक and the other words explained above. देवल defines श्रोत्रिय as 'एकां शाखां सकल्पां वा षड्भिरङ्गैरधीत्य वा । षट्कर्मानरतो विप्रः श्रोत्रियो नाम धर्मवित्॥'q. by श्रा. प्र. p. 59. Pāṇini (V. 2.84) derives श्रोत्रिय as श्रोत्रियश्छन्दोधीते. षट्कर्म-refers to यजनयाजनाध्ययनाध्यापनप्रतिग्रहदानानि.

Gaut. 15. 28, Baud. Dh. S. II, 8.2, Manu III. 185-186, Yāj. I. 219, Varahapurāṇa 14.2 contain almost the same words about those who sanctify the company of diners (i. e. who are _paṅktipāvana_). The Anuśāsanaparva (90.25-31), Kūrmapurāṇa II. 21.1-14, Matsya 16. 7-13, Brahmapurāṇa 220. 101-104, Vāyu 79.56-59 and 83.5R-55, Skanda VI. 217. 21-25 give long lists of _paṅktipāvana_ brāhmaṇas. The Hir. Gr. II. 10.2, Baud, Dh. S. II. 2. 7, Kūrma (II. 21. 14) and others say that a performer of śrāddha should invite one who is not a relative connected by marriage (such as a maternal uncle) nor one who is of the same gotra, nor one who is connected with the performer by Veda study (i. e. is his teacher or pupil), nor a friend nor one who expects monetary help from the performer. Manu (IIT, 138-139) provides that one should not invite at a śrāddha dinner a personal friend, that one may gain a friend by making valuable gifts to him (on other occasions), that one should feed at a śrāddha a brāhmaṇa whom he does not deem either his friend or foe and that he who performs śrāddhas and offerings to gods chiefly to gain friends reaps no reward after death by those śrāddhas or offerings. But Manu III. 144 (= Kūrma II, 21-22) provides that one may invite even a friend but not a foe though the latter may be learned. Manu (III. 135-137 and 145-147 ) lays down that the main or best rule to be followed is to present śrāddha food to those who are devoted to spiritual knowledge, that between a man who has studied one whole recension of the Veda but whose father was not a śrotriya and one who is himself not a śrotriya but whose father had studied a whole recension of the Veda (i. e.whose father was a śrotriya) the latter is the more worthy of the two, that one should strive to feed at a śrāddha an adherent of the Ṛgveda who has studied one entire recension of that Veda or a follower of the Yajurveda who has studied one Śakhā thereof or a singer of sāmans who has finished one recension of the Sāmaveda and that if one of these preceding three is honoured and dines at a śrāddha, the ancestors of the performer will be gratified up to the seventh generation for a very long time. Harita (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 392 and Kalpataru on śr. pp. 66-67) describes the qualifications of those who are pāṅkteya brāhmaṇas viz, they must be born in a high family (possessing four characteristics), must be endowed with learning ( of six kinds ) and _śila_(character of 13 kinds) and good conduct (of 16 kinds).

ŚaṇkhaLikhita[^863] give a long list of pāṅkteya (fit to be associated within a _paṅkti_ i. e. row of diners) brāhmaṇas, viz, he who knows the Veda and the Vedāṅgas (viz. phonetics, kalpa or śrauta ritual, grammar, Nirukta, metrics and astronomy); one who keeps the five fires; one who has studied the Veda with its _aṅgas_; one who knows Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Upanişads and Dharmaśāstra; a śrotriya, a triņāciketa, trimadhu, trisuparņaka and one that has studied Jyeṣṭhasāman; one who has studied Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Upanişads and Dharmaśāstra; who is devoted to Veda; who always keeps sacred fires; who is obedient to his parents and devoted to Dharmaśāstra. Similar rules are laid down by Viṣṇu Db. S. 83, Brhat-Parāśara p. 150, Vr̥ddha-Gautama p. 581, Prajāpati verses 70-72, Laghu-Sātātapa verses 99 100, Aušanasasmṛti (Jiv. vol. I. pp. 523-524). As Medhātithi[^864] on Manu III 147 says the gist of all these passages is that a learned brāhmaṇa who has studied the Veda, whose conduct is good, whose family is famous, who is the son of a śrotriya father and who is not related to the performer must be invited and all the rest is mere arthavāda (by way of eulogy). Manu (III. 128) laid down two propositions viz, all food offered as sacrifice to the gods and manes must be given only to a brāhmaṇa who studies the Veda and that whatever is presented to the most worthy brāhmaṇa (among brāhmaṇas studying the Veda) brings in the greatest rewards. Then Manu (III. 183) declares that _paṅktipāvana_ brāhmaṇas are those that sanctify a row of diners among whom sit some who are tainted by (latent) blemishes that make them unfit to be among the diners. Then Manu (III. 184-186) gives examples of paṅktipāvana brāhmaṇas viz, those who are the foremost among students of all the Vedas or their expository works and who are born in a family of unbroken descent of Vedic students, who are Triṇāciketa &c. Hemādri (on śr, pp. 391-395) and Kalpataru (śr. pp. 64-65) quote numerous verses from Yama on _paṅktipāvana_.

Manu III, 147 asserts that the best course is to invite a brāhmaṇa who fulfils the conditions laid down in Manu III.

[^864]: श्रोत्रियो विद्वान् साधुचरणः प्रख्याताभिजनः श्रोत्रियापत्यमसम्बन्धो भोजनीयः ।। परिशिष्टं सर्वमर्थवादार्थम् ॥ मेधा. on मनु III. 147.

132-146, but adds that if it is not possible to secure such a brāhmaṇa then the next best course[^865] (anukalpa') may be followed, viz. the performer may invite his own maternal grandfather, his maternal uncle, sister's son, father-in-law, his teacher of the Veda, daughter's son, son-in-law, a _bandhu_ (such as mother's sister's son), wife's brother or a _sagotra_, or his family priest, or his pupil. Similar provisions occur in Yāj. I. 220, Kūrma (Uttarārdha 21. 20), Varāhapurāņa 14. 3, Matsya 16. 10-11, Viṣṇupurāņa III. 15. 2-4 (anukalpeşvanantarān). But Manu is careful[^866] to point out in a later chapter that one who is able to observe the best course, but observes the second best does not reap other-worldly rewards by his actions. Even Āp. Dh, S.[^867] expressly says that if strangers do not possess the requisite qualifications, then even one's full brother possessed of all the qualifications (as to Vedic learning, good conduct &c.) and pupils may be fed at a śrāddha. Baud. Dh. S. also allows even a sapiṇḍa to be fed[^868]. Gaut. 15. 20 appears to be of the view that even pupils and _sagotras_ may be invited when they are possessed of excellent qualities and strangers with good qualifications are not available. Even in these times very learned brāhmaṇas are unwilling to be fed at a śrāddha, particularly within a few years (three or five ) from the death of the person for whose benefit the śrāddha is to be performed. Smṛtis attach a certain stigma to the fact of being the recipient of a śrāddha dinner and prāyaścittas are prescribed. For example, the Mit, on Yāj. III. 289 quotes several verses of Bhāradvāja, one of which says "If a brāhmaṇa dines at a pārvaņa śrāddha he has to perform six prāņāyāmas (as expiation), if he dines at a śrāddha from the third month after a person's death to one year, he has to undergo a fast; if he dines at a vṛddhiśrāddha, he has to perform three prāņāyāmas, and a fast for a day and night if he dines at a sapiṇḍana śrāddha.'

[^865]: मुख्याभावे योनुष्ठीयते प्रतिनिधिन्यायेन सोऽनुकल्प उच्यते । मेधा. on मनु III. 147. The अमरकोश says 'मुख्यः स्यात्प्रथमः कल्पोऽनुकल्पस्तु ततोऽधम:'.

[^866]: प्रभुः प्रथमकल्पस्य योऽनुकल्पेन वर्तते । न साम्परायिकं तस्य दर्मतेर्विद्यते फलम् ॥ मनु XI. 30 (= शान्तिपर्व 165.17) q in तन्त्रवार्तिक p. 191, where the 2nd half is स नामोलि फलं तस्य परत्रेति विचारितम् ॥.

[^868]: तस्मादेवंविधं सपिण्डमप्याशयेत् । बौ. ध. II. 8.5. The श्री क.ल. p.40 explains एवंविधं as गुणवन्तम्.

The Mit. further quotes a verse from Dhaumya which prescribes Cāndrāyana for dining at a śrāddha on the birth of a son or at simantonnayana, in a navaśrāddha etc. Vide also Nirṇayasindhu III, pp. 467-468 for prāyascittas on eating śrāddha dinners, The Varāhapurāṇa (189. 12-13) provides that if a brāhmaṇa dies while the food offered to a preta is still in his stomach he dwells for a _kalpa_ in a horrible hell, becomes a rākşasa and then becomes free from the sin.

According to Gaut. 15.10 young persons with the requisite qualifications are to be preferred to older ones, while, according to some, young men were to be invited at a śrāddha for one's deceased father and old men for a śrāddha for one's grand father. On the other hand, Āp. Dh. S. says among brāhmaṇas possessing the same qualifications, the older ones are to be preferred and among those that are old are to be preferred the poor that are anxious to earn money[^868a].

Some of the works lay special emphasis on inviting ascetics or _yogins_ at a śrāddha dinner. The Viṣṇu Dh. S. states that yogins[^869] are particularly _pańktipāvana_ and quotes a stanza as recited by the pitṛs ‘May (a descendant) be born in our family who feeds a brāhmaṇa yogin at a śrāddha by which we are ourselves satisfied.' The Varāhapurāņa 14.50 says that a yogin is superior to 100 brāhmaṇas. The Mārkaṇḍeya-purāņa provides a wise man should always feed yogins at a śrāddha since the pitṛs rely for support on Yoga; if a yogin is fed by being seated as the first among thousands of brāhmaṇas he saves the performer and the other diners as a boat saves men in water.' Then it quotes stanzas sung by the pitṛs (29. 32-34) to king Aila. The Saurapurāņa, after mentioning the qualifications (in 19.2-3),[^870] winds up by stating that even one may suffice provided he be a single-minded devotee of Sivā (verse 6).

The important पितृगाथाs are 'कदा नः सन्ततावग्यः कस्यचिद्भविता सुतः॥ यो योगिभुक्तशेषान्नो भुवि पिण्डं प्रवास्यति। गयायामथवा पिण्डं खङ्गमांसं तथा हविः । कालशाकं तिलाज्यं च तृप्तये कृसरं च नः॥ ब्रह्मपुराण 220. 113-115 and मार्कण्डेय 29, 33-34.

The Matsyapurāņa (16. 11-12) recommends 'He who expounds (the meaning of) texts; he who enters upon the discussion of þrauta sacrifices and he who knows the rules about the accents of sāmans is a purifier of _paṅktipāvanas_; one proficient in the Sāmaveda, a Vedic student, one endowed with knowledge of the Veda or of _Brahma_ --where these are fed in a śrāddha it yields the highest benefit'[^871]. Though in the above passages the greatest emphasis was laid on the possession of Vedic learning by the brāhmaṇas to be fed, one had also to see whether they were men of good character and observers of the rules of proper conduct, as provided by Aśy, Gr. IV. 7. 2 (note 862), Gaut. 15.9 and Manu II, 118 who says 'a brāhmaṇa[^872] knowing only the sacred Gāyatri but living a well-regulated life is to be preferred and not one who knows the three Vedas but who is not well-regulated in conduct and who eats anything (even forbidden food ) and who is a vendor of everything.' The Skandapurāṇa VI. 217. 27 recommends that one should make every effort to know the family of the brāhmaṇas, then their character (śila), then their age and then the facts about whom they marry or to whom they give their daughters in marriage. The Brahmāņda (Upodghāta, chap. 15) says that there should be no scrutiny of a brāhmaṇa about whom nothing is known because _siddhas_ (yogins) roam about on the earth in the form of brāhmaṇas. But if faults in a brāhmaṇa are easily seen or if one knows his disqualifications on account of one's dwelling near him, he should not be invited (verses 5-6). The same Purāṇa (Upodghāta 15. 24-26) arranges the orders of preference as follows: first yati (ascetic), then a brāhmaṇa who knows the four Vedas and itihāsa, then one who knows three Vedas, then one who knows two, then one who knows one Veda, then one who is an _upādhyāya_.

Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 443) quotes the Agnipurāņa[^873] as follows: 'what is the use of (birth in a) famous family if the man is himself devoid of good conduct? Are not insects found in fragrant flowers ?' Jātükarṇya says 'one should not honour even with a word (much less with food &c.) in rites for gods and Manes bad brāhmaṇas void of good conduct, even though they be endowed with learning and be born in a good family. This insistence on worth was due to the conception that pitṛs assuming an aerial form enter brāhmaṇas at the time of śrāddha. Vide Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa (Upodghātapāda 11. 49).

These requirements of learning, character and good conduct would naturally make it incumbent on the performer of a śrāddha to inquire into the antecedents, qualities and defects of the brāhmaṇas to be invited. Manu and others lay down several rules about the testing of the brāhmaṇas to be invited. Manu III, 149, Viṣṇu Dh.874 S. 82.1-2. provide at an offering to the gods let a man not enquire into (the qualities of) a brāhmaṇa ( when he wants to invite ), but at a śrāddha offering to the Manes close inquiry (into qualities ) is declared to be proper and just.' Manu III. 130 says that even if a brāhmaṇa be master of the Veda, one should enquire far (into his ancestry). The Vāyupurāṇa[^875] appears to provide that inquiry into (the qualifications of ) brāhmaṇas should not be always undertaken when gifts are to be made, but enquiry is declared (necessary) in the case of rites for gods and Manes. The Anuśāsanaparva provides[^876] that in rites meant for gods a ksatriya knowing the rules about gifts should not (closely) inquire into the qualifications of brāhmaṇas, but in rites for the gods and Manes such inquiry is quite proper. Vṛddha-Manu and the Matsya-purāṇa[^877] lay down that a brāhmaṇa's character is to be inquired into at the place where he resides for a long time, his purity by his acts and transactions with other people, his intelligence by discussion with him: with these three one should inquire whether the brāhmaṇa (to be invited) is a worthy person.

## Inquiring into qualifications

The Nṛsimhapurāna[^878] forbids close inquiry into the character and learning of one who comes by chance as a guest at the time of śrāddha. That inquiry was allowed as to brāhmaṇas who were invited and not as to those who came by chance uninvited as _atithis_. There are no doubt certain passages particularly in the Purāṇas where scrutiny into a brāhmaṇa's qualifications is condemned. For example, the Skandapurāņa quoted by Aparārka (p. 455) and Kalpataru (on śr. p. 102) states 'The Vedic revelation is that śrāddha is to be offered (to a brāhmaṇa) after inquiry (into his learning and character), but straightforward action is better than scrutiny. When one offers śrāddha straightforwardly without inquiry his pitṛs are gratified and also gods'. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa (q. by Bālambhatti ) states 'it is my view also that one should not test (the qualifications of) brāhmaṇas; one should only consider their caste and not their virtues'. Such passages are explained away as referring to a śrāddha at sacred places or as applicable to gifts or to _atithis_ (vide Hemādri on śrāddha p. 513, and Bālambhatti on ācāra p. 494 )[^878a].

## Persons unfit to be invited

Brāhmaņas were declared to be _apāṅkteya_[^879] (not fit to sit in the row of brāhmaṇa diners or as defiling a row of diners at śrāddha) on various grounds, such as bodily and mental defects and diseases, pursuit of certain avocations, moral lapses, being guilty of crimes, being followers of unorthodox systems, being inhabitants of certain countries. A distinction has to be made between brāhmaṇas who should not be invited and brāhmaṇas that are _apāṅkteya_ or _paṅktidūşaka_. For example, one should not ordinarily invite a friend or a sagotra brāhmaṇa even though learned, but these are not _apāṅkteya_.

The Ap.[^880] Dh. S. states that one suffering from white leprosy, a bald man, the violator of another man's bed, the son of a brāhmaṇa who was a soldier by profession, the son of (brāhmaṇa who had become like) a śūdra from a brāhmaṇa woman--these defile the company if they are invited at a śrāddha repast. Vas. Dh. S. XI. 19 also gives a brief list viz. 'one should avoid naked (ascetics), those suffering from white leprosy, impotent men, blind men, those who have black teeth, those afflicted with black leprosy and those who have deformed nails'. Very long lists of persons unfit to be invited at a śrāddha are given by Gaut. XV. 16-19, Manu III. 150-166, Yāj. I. 222-224, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 82. 3-29, Atri (verses 345–359 and 385-388), Bṛhad-Yama III. 34-38, Bṛhat-Parāśara pp. 149–150, Vṛddha-Gautama pp. 580-581, the Vāyu-purāṇa 83.61-70, Anušāsana-parva 90.6-11, Matsyapurāṇa 16.14-17, Kūrma (II. 21. 23-47), Skanda VII, 1.205.58-72, VL 217.11-20, Varāhapurāṇa 14,4-6, Brahma purāņa 220. 127-135, Brahmāṇḍapurāņa (Upodghāta 15,39-44 and 19.30-41 ), Mārkaṇḍeya 28.26-30, Viṣṇupurāṇa (III. 15.5-8), Nāradapurāņa (pārvārdha 28.11-18), Saurapurāņa (19.7–9 ) and several other works. The list in the Manusmṛti is one of the longest and that is set out here. One should not invite a brāhmaṇa that is (1) a thief, (2) an outcaste, (3) an impotent man, (4) an atheist, (5) one who wears his hair in braids (a student yet learning Veda); (6) one who does not study the Veda, (7) one who is afflicted with a skin disease, (8) a gambler, (9) one officiating as a priest for a multitude of men, (10) a physician, (11) temple priest (who worships images for money), (12) vendor of meat, (13) one who makes his livelihood as shopkeeper, (14 and 15) a paid servant of a village or of a king, (16) one with deformed nails, (17) one whose teeth are black (naturally), (18) one who opposes his _guru_, (19) one who has forsaken his sacred fire (_śrauta or smārta_) without a proper cause, (20) a usurer, (21) one suffering from consumption, (22) one who subsists by tending cattle (though not in distress), (23 and 24) a younger brother who marries or kindles sacred fires before his elder brother, (25) one who neglects the five (daily) sacrifices, (26) an enemy of brāhmaṇas or of Veda, (27 and 28 ) an elder brother who marries or kindles sacred fires after his young brother, (29) one who is a member of a guild or corporation, (30) an actor or singer, (31) one who has broken the vow of student-hood by unchastity, (32) one whose (only or first wife ) is a südra female, (33) the son of a remarried woman, (34) a squint-eyed or one-eyed man, (35) one in whose house a paramour of his wife resides, (36) one who teaches for hire, (37) one who is taught by a hired teacher, (38) one whose teacher is a südra. (39) one who instructs śūdra pupils, (40) one whose speech is harsh and untrue, (41) the son of an adulteress, (42) the son of a widow, (43) one who forsakes his mother, father or teacher without (adequate) cause, (44) one who has contracted an alliance with patitas either through the Veda (i. e. as teacher or pupil) or through marriage, (45) an incendiary, (46) one who undertakes sea-voyages, (47) a bard, (48) an oil-man, (49) a false witness (or forger of documents or counterfeiter of coins ), (50) one who has a dispute with his father in a law court, (51) one who induces others to gamble, (52) one who drinks wine, (53) one afflicted with a disease (in punishment for crimes in former lives), (54) one accused of a grave sin, (55) a hypocrite, (56) a vendor of substances used for flavouring food (such as sugar cane juice or molasses), (57) a manufacturer of bows and arrows, (58) one who is the husband of a woman married before her elder sister, (59) the betrayer of a friend, (60) the keeper of a gambling house, (61) one who learns (the Veda) from his own son, (62) an epilectic man,(63) one who has scrofulous swellings of the glands, (64) one afflicted with white leprosy, (65) an informer, (66) a lunatic, (67) a blind man, (68) a caviller of the Veda, (69) a trainer of elephants, horses, oxen or camels, (70) one subsisting by the practice of astrology, (71) a bird-fancier, (72) one who gives instructions in the use of weapons/78).one who diverts watercourses, (74) one engaged in obstructing watercourses, (175) one subsisting by teaching or practising architecture, (76) a messenger, (77) one who plant trees for money, (78) a breeder of sporting dogs, (79) a falconer, (80) a defiler of a maiden (or who ascribes falsely fault to a maiden), (81) one given to injuring living beings, (82) one who gains his livelihood from śūdras, (83) one who officiates at a sacrifice on behalf of guilds, (84) one who does not follow the ordinary rules of conduct (as welcoming a guest &c.), (85) one who has no energy for religious acts, (86) one who con stantly begs for gifts, (87) one who subsists by agriculture (carried on personally), (88) one who suffers from elephantiasis, (89) one who is condemned by good men, (90) a shepherd, (91) a keeper of buffaloes, (92) the husband of a remarried woman, (93) a carrier of dead bodies (for money )[^881] Manu III. 167 says that a brāhmaṇa who knows the sacred laws should avoid or shun at both (sacrifices to Gods and to Manes) the worst of brāhmaṇas enumerated above whose conduct is repre hensible and who are unworthy of sitting in a row of brāhmaņas at a śrāddha repast.

[^880]:  श्वित्री शिपिविष्टः परतल्पगाम्यायुधीयपुत्रः शूद्रोत्पन्नो बाह्मण्यामित्येते श्राद्धे भुञ्जानाः पङ्क्तिदूषका भवन्ति । आप. ध. सू. II. 7.17.21. As the son of a śūdra male from a brāhmaṇa woman was treated as a câṇḍāla in many smṛtis and therefore could not possibly have been intended to be invited at a śrāddha. Kapardin explained the words शूद्रो...ह्मण्याम् as meaning 'born of a brāhmana male that had become practically a śūdra by first marrying a śūdra woman, then a brāhmaṇa woman and procreating a son on that śūdra wife and then on the brāhmana wife,' This latter (as the son of a शूद्धसम ब्राह्मण) is 'अपाङ्क्तेय, शूद्रोत्पन्नो ब्राह्मण्यां असमवर्णदारपरिग्रहे बाह्मण्यां पुत्रमनुत्पाद्य शूद्रायामुत्पादितपुत्र इति कपर्दी' कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 90.), हरदत्त followse कपर्दी. हेमाद्रि (श्रा. p. 496) omits all reference to marrying a śūdra wife first and explains 'यो विशुद्धजातीयायामपि ब्राह्मण्यां शूद्रात् शूद्रसमानाद् ब्राह्मणादुत्पन्नः ।

[^881]: There is some divergence of views among the commentators about the meanings of certain words occurring in Manu III, 150-166. For reasons of space that matter is not discussed here in detail. A few points alone are noted here. निराकृतिः is explained in two ways viz. (i) one who does not perform the daily five Mahāyajñas, (2) one who after learning the Veda forgets it. The evil diseases are said by Devala to be eight 'उन्मादस्त्वद्गोषो राजयक्ष्मा श्वासो मधुमेहो भगन्दरो महोदरमश्मरीत्यष्टौ पापरोगाः', q. by अपरार्क p. 451, स्मृतिच. (श्रा) p. 401. वृषली explained in various ways by Skandapurāṇa VII. 1. 205. 77-80 as meaning a śūdra woman, as one who abandoning her husband cohabits with another, as a girl who is not married though she has reached the age of puberty, as a prostitute, as one who is sterile, or one all whose children are dead. अग्रेदिधिषूपतिः:-When a younger sister gets married before her elder sister the former is called अग्रेदिधिषू while the latter is called दिधिषू. देवल says 'जेष्ठायां यद्यनूढायां कन्यायामुह्यतेऽनुजा। सा चाग्रेधिषूर्ज्ञेया पूर्वा च दिधिषूर्मता॥' q. by अपरार्क p. 451, मिता. on या. III. 265. अग्रेदिधिषूपति is taken by मेधातिथि as equal to two words viz. अग्रेदिधिषू and दिधिषूपति. The latter means, according to the Amarakośa, the husband of a remarried woman, while the former means 'one who is the first husband of a remarried woman' पुनर्भूर्दिधिषूरूढा द्विस्तस्या दिधिषूः पतिः। स तु द्विजोग्रेदिधिषूः सैव यस्य कुटुम्बिनी॥ अमरकोश q. by हरदत्त on गौ. 15. 15. मनु. III 173 explains दिधिषूपति as one who lasciviously dallies with the widow of his deceased brother. though she be appointed (to bear a son by him) according to the sacred law. The स्मृतिs said that the brother appointed should cohabit as an act of duty and not through passion for the widow. Hemadri p. 485 gives another
meaning of अग्रेदिधिषू 'जीवतस्तावद् भ्रातुर्भार्यायामनुरक्तोऽयेदिधिषूः'. वसिष्ठ I. 18 includes both अग्रेदिधिषू and दिधिषूपति among those who are called एनस्विनः. Even the तै.ब्रा. III. 2.8. 12 mentions अग्रेदिधिषु as a sinner and आप. ध.सू (II. 5. 12. 22) mentions both.

Manu III. 170-182 indulge in pointing out how feeding such unworthy brāhmaṇas results in the loss of the gratification of pitṛs and state that the food eaten by such unworthy persons becomes or is to be deemed as equal to foul things. The Kūrmapurāṇa[^882] forbids inviting at śrāddhas Bauddha ascetics, Nirgranthas (devotees who have withdrawn from the world and wander about naked or as beggars), those that follow the Pañcarātra and Pāśupata doctrines, those that are kāpālikas (devotees of Śiva of the left hand order) and other similar heretical people. The Viṣņupurāņa (III. 18. 70 ff) narrates how a king after a bath in a holy place talked with a heretic and had to pass in consequence through the bodies of a dog, a jackal, wolf, vulture, a crow, a crane and peacock and ultimately became freed from the taint by a bath at the avabhṛtha in an Aśvamedha sacrifice. The same Purāṇa provides (III. 18. 97) that one should avoid talking with or touching heretics, particularly at the time of a religious rite or when one has consecrated for a solemn sacrifice. The Vāyupurāņa[^883] provides that people who are 'nagna' should not be allowed to see a śrāddha and then defines "nagna' people as follows: 'the three Vedas are declared to be a protective covering for all beings and therefore those who foolishly abandon the Vedas are called 'nagna'; those who vainly keep matted hair, those who shave their heads for no purpose, those who are _nagna_ (naked) without any cause, those who engage in certain observances and mutter certain words aimlessly are called '_nagnādi_'.

The same verse occurs in a corrupt form in वायु 78.30-31.

The स्मृतिच. (श्रा.) p. 411 reads वर्णानां for भूतानां and ascribes that verse to the ब्रह्माण्डपुराण. ब्रह्माण्ड (उपोद्धातपाद 14.35-41) has these verses. अपरार्क. 473 ascribes verse सर्वेषामेव भूतानां to ब्रह्माण्डपुराण, which is found in उपोद्घातपाद 14.35.

Just as certain countries were declared unfit for the performance of śrāddhas (vide note 853 above), so certain brāhmaṇas hailing from certain countries were declared in some works as not fit to be invited at a śrāddha[^884]. For example, the Matsyapurāņa states that brāhmaṇas that are ungrateful, that are atheists, that stay in _Mleccha_ countries or the countries of Triśaṅku, Karavira, Āndhra, Cīna, Draviḍa and Koṅkaṇa should be carefully avoided at the time of śrāddha. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 505) quotes from the Saurapurāṇa the following: 'Brāhmaṇas hailing from the countries of Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga, Saurāştra, (Kāthiawar), Gurjara, Ābhira, Koṅkaṇa, Draviḍa, Dakṣināpatha, Avanti and Magadha should be avoided at śrāddhas. It will be noticed that putting the above two passages together, brāhmaṇas from half of modern India would have been ineligible for being invited at śrāddhas if these passages were literally followed. This was probably a counsel of perfection prompted by the false pride and prejudices of the authors of those works. The Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara (pp. 39-41 ) contains one of the longest lists of persons unfit to be invited at a śrāddha.

The following reason is advanced by the Varāhapurāṇa[^885] and others for honouring a guest who comes by chance at the time when a śrāddha rite is in progress: "Yogins wander over the earth assuming different forms that prevent recognition, but doing good to people; therefore a wise man should honour a guest who arrives at the time of the performance of a śrāddha". The Bhaviṣya-purāņa[^886] similarly says that an _atithi_ ( guest ) at a śrāddha is one who comes when least thought of and not one who had arrived before the śrāddha rite started. The Mārkaṇḍeya ( 26, 30 ) provides that one should not ask such an _atithi_ about his _gotra_ or _caraṇa_ or his Vedic study nor should one consider whether he has a fine appearance.

## Honouring atithi at śrāddha

Hemādri (on śrāddha pp. 430-433 ) quotes verses from the Sivadharmottara, Viṣṇudharmottara and Vāyu (71.74–75 ) Purāṇas that gods, _siddhas_ and yogins wander over the earth in the form of brāhmaṇa _atithis_ in order to favour people and to see how śrāddhas are being performed. About the definition of an _atithi_ and the necessity and mode of honouring a guest in general, vide H, of Dh. vol. II. pp. 749-756.

Hemādri (Śrāddhakāņḍa, pp. 380-385) holds an interesting discussion as to whether a performer of śrāddha belonging to one recension of a Veda must restrict himself to inviting brāhmaṇas that are students of the same recension of the Veda or whether he can invite any brāhmaṇa that may have studied any of the three Vedas. Some people relying on a maxim ('as in the case of a bride so in the case of an offering') invite only brāhmaṇas of their own _śākhā_ possessed of the qualifications above set forth. Hemādri replies that this is a wrong notion, relies on Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 15.9 'one should feed[^887] in all (religious) acts brāhmaṇas that are pure (in their conduct) and that have studied the Veda' and asserts that no smṛti, Itihāsa, Purāņa, Gṛhyasūtra nor Kalpasūtra contains the restriction of inviting only brāhmaṇas of the performer's own śākhā. He further says that in such texts as 'triṇāciketas trimadhuḥ' (quoted in note 862a above) the rule laid down is to invite brāhmaṇas that have studied different śakhās and Vedas. He rejects the idea about any restriction as to selecting a bridegroom of the same śākhā as the bride's father and remarks that if some people are not prepared to give their daughters in marriage to young men belonging to other śākhās, that is due to ignorance about the families and is also due to pride and vanity. He winds up by saying that in Āryāvarta countries it is found on all sides that marriage connections are entered into with persons studying different śākhās but living in the same district, (such connections) not being condemned, while persons who study the same śākhā of the Veda but do not know each other do not enter into marital connections[^888].

As a contrast to this commonsense view it should be noted that the author of the Bālambhatti recommends that 'Mahārāstra brāhmaṇas should not invite brāhmaṇas of other castes (of brāhmaṇas ) and particularly the Koṅkaṇastha brāhmaṇas should be avoided and it goes so far as to say that a pergon belonging to one's own caste not possessed of good qualities and of a blemished character (provided he is not guilty of mahāpātakas or the like) should be preferred to one belonging to another sub-caste even if endowed with good qualities.

The Vas. Dh, S. provides[^889] that the performer should invite ascetics, house-holders, well conducted men, who are not rery old &c.

[^889]: पूर्वेधुर्ब्राह्मणान् संनिपात्य यतीन् गृहस्थान्साधून्वा परिणतवयसोऽविकर्मस्थात्र श्रोत्रियान शिष्याननन्तेवासिनः । वसिष्ठ XI.17, q. by हेमादि p. 379 who explains 'यतयः प्रवजिताः तदसम्भवे गृहस्थान'. The टोडरानन्द (श्राद्धसौख्य folio 37b) arranges the persons to be invited at a श्राद्ध in the following order: तदयं संक्षेपः । आदौ त्रिदण्डयतिस्तदलाभे वानप्रस्थस्तदलाभे ब्रह्मचारी तदलाभे गृहस्थस्तत्रापि पङ्क्तिपावनादय उत्कृष्टास्तदलाभे यो ह्यसम्बद्धः सत्कर्मा च तदलाभे तत्सम्बद्धा अपि तदलाभे सदाचारः शिष्योऽपि ।

## Yati preferred as an invitee

The Kārmapurāṇa states[^890] “that man whose offering (of food ) is eaten by a _yati_ that knows the truth about _prakr̥ti_ (primordial matter) and the _guṇas_ (_sattva_, _rajas_ and _tamas_) reaps the reward (merit) of feeding a thousand (other brāhmaṇas). Therefore one should feed in offerings to gods and manes an excellent _yogin_ who is intent on true knowledge of God and others only if such a one is not available.' Similar verses about ascetics and yogins occur in Varāhapurāṇa 14.50, Skanda (VI.217.7 ff) and Vayupurāṇa[^891] chap.71.65-73, chap.76.28 &c. Bṛhaspati provides[^892] a special rule that, if a person cannot afford to feed at a śrāddha more than one brāhmaṇa, then he should feed one who has studied the Sāmaveda, since in him all the three viz.R̥ks, the Yajus and Sāmans co-exist, that the father is pleased byR̥ks (i.e. by the feeding of a brāhmaṇa who has studied the Ṛgveda), the grand-father by Yajus, the great-grand-father by a Sāman and a _chandoga_ (a chanter of the whole of Samaveda) is superior. A verse of Satatapa is[^893] quoted to the effect that if a student of the Atharvaveda is fed in a rite for the gods or manes, that yields endless and inexhaustible rewards.

Some of the smr̥tis were very strict in laying down the qualifications of brāhmaṇas to be invited at a śrāddha. Auśanasa (chap. 4) asserts: 'that brāhmaṇa[^894] is called _dur̥brāhmaṇa_ and should never be invited at a śrāddha in whose family Veda study and Vedi (i.e, the performance of Śrauta sacrifices) have been stopped for three generations'.

Vide त्रिकाण्डमण्डन I. 134-135 for similar definitions.

The same author[^895] further says that six persons are merely _brahmabamdhus_ (i.e. brāhmaṇas by birth or caste alone) viz. one who is hired by a śūdra or a king as a servant, who has a śūdra woman as his wife, who is a village priest and he who subsists by killing (animals) or by catching them. So early as the Mahābhāsya[^896] it was stated that austerities (leading a life of restraint and strict observances), Vedic learning and birth (from brāhmaṇa parents) are the causes of (a man being called) a brāhmaṇa and that he who is devoid of the first two is a mere brāhmaṇa by caste (but not a real brāhmaṇa). It is curious to note that Yama stated that, if brāhmaṇas that do not declare (or point out) the auspicious nakşatra or _tithi_ or day or muhūrta and other auspicious matters, eat (śrāddha) food it becomes inexhaustible.

But the requisite qualifications were so exacting that it must have been found almost impossible to secure for a śrāddha brāhmaṇas altogether free from any of the blemishes set out above from Manu. Gautama (15. 15-18) contains long lists[^897] of over 50 kinds of brāhmaṇas that were not to be invited at a śrāddha dinner or at a sacrifice for gods, but Gaut. adds that according to some only those beginning with '_durvāla_' (Gaut. in 15.18) were to be shunned at a śrāddha (but could be invited at a sacrifice for the gods). The persons so to be shunned, according to some who flourished before Gautama (i.e. at least before 600 B. C.) are: a bald man, a man who has deformed nails or has black teeth (naturally), one suffering from white leprosy, the son of a re-married woman, a gambler, one who neglects _japa_ ( the recitation of Vedic mantras), a servant of the king, one who uses false weights and measures, one whose (only) wife is a südra female, one who does not perform the daily five sacrifices, one who suffers from a virulent skin disease, a usurer, one who lives by trade or by handicrafts, one who makes his living by (manufacturing) bows (and arrows) or by playing on musical instruments or by keeping time (when another is singing), or by dancing or singing.

## Persons to be shunned

 Vas. quotes a verse[^898] as follows: If a brāhmaṇa knowing the Vedas is afflicted with physical defects which (ordinarily ) exclude a person from a row of diners, Yama declares that he is irreproachable and that he does sanctify the row of diners. But it must be said that even in modern times emphasis is laid on inviting learned and well-conducted brāhmaṇas for śrāddha. The idea (expressed by Manu III. 189 and the Padmapurāņa) persists that the _pitṛs_ enter into and hover round the invited brāhmaṇas and that the latter are to be looked upon as representing the _pitṛs_[^899]. The Garuḍapurāṇa states that Yama allows the departed souls and the pitṛs to visit the world of men at the time of śrāddha from the nether regions.

The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (79.19-21) prescribes that the performer should avoid wrath, should not shed tears and should not do things in a hurry. The Varāhapurāņa[^900] provides that the performer should not employ twigs for brushing the teeth (but should rinse his mouth twelve times with water), should remain chaste and pure. Āp. Dh. S. prescribes[^901] that the performer should not eat food from the commencement (from the time he goes out to invite) up to the end of the śrāddha rite.

[^898]: अथाप्युदाहरन्ति। अथ चेन्मन्त्रविद्युक्तः शारीरैः पङ्क्तिदूषणैः। अदुष्यं तं यमः प्राह पङ्क्तिपावन एव सः॥ वसिष्ठधर्मसूत्र XI. 20, q. by मेधातिथि on मनु III. 168. The verse is also अत्रि 350-51 and लघुशङ्ख 22.

[^900]: वराहपुराणे। दन्तकाष्ठं च विसृजेद् ब्रह्मचारी शुचिर्भवेत्। q. by कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 104), श्रा. प्र. p. 112.

[^901]: आरब्धे चाभोजनमा समापनात् । आप. ध. सू II. 7.17.24.

The Kūrma (uttarārdha 22.8) states that if a person first invites a brāhmaṇa and then foolishly invites another (passing over the first) then he becomes a greater sinner (than the brāhmaṇa who after accepting one invitation promises to dine at another śrāddha) and is born as a worm in human faeces. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa[^902] provides that honouring gods, pitṛs and men and feeding (brāhmaṇas) should not be done without wearing an upper garment; otherwise the rite will bear no fruit.

About the number of brāhmaṇas to be invited at a śrāddha there were several options and several views. The Āsv. Gr. S. states[^903] that at the Pārvaṇa-śrāddha (performed on a _parvan_ day i.e. on Amāvāsya), the Ābhyudayika śrāddha, the Ekod diṣṭa or _Kāmya_, the larger the number of brāhmaṇas the greater is the reward, that in no case should a person invite only one brāhmaņa at a śrāddha meant for all pitṛs or he may optionally invite only one brāhmaṇa except at the first śrāddha, that he may invite one, two or three brāhmaṇas for each of the three paternal ancestors. The Sān. Gr. (IV. 1,2) and Kauṣītaki Gr. III. 14.1-2 prescribe that one should[^904] invite an uneven number of brāhmaṇas, at least three, to sit down as (representing the) fathers. Gaut. requires[^905] 'He shall feed an uneven number of brāhmaṇas, at least nine or as many as he is able (to feed) and that they should be learned in the Veda and endowed with polished speech, good appearance, mature age and good character'.

[^903]: ब्राह्मणान् श्रुतशीलवृत्तसम्पन्नानेकेन वा काले ज्ञापितान् स्नातान कृतपच्छौचाना चान्तानुदङ्मुखान पितृवदुपवेश्यैकैकमेकस्य द्वौ द्वौ त्रींस्त्रीन्वा वृद्धौ फलभूयस्त्वं न त्वेवैकं सर्वेषाम् । काममनाद्ये । आश्व, गृ. सू. IV, 7. 2-3. पितृवत् is explained in two ways by नारायण 'पितृवदिति वचनं ममैते पितर इति मनसा ध्यायन्नपवेशयेदित्येवमर्थमित्येके ।' अन्ये तु पितुर्वृद्धं पितामहाय वृद्धतरं प्रपितामहाय वृद्धतममित्येवं यथावय उपवेशनार्थमिति।. The words नत्वेवैकं सर्वेषाम् in आश्व, are opposed to मनु III. 125. नारायण gives several meanings of अनाद्ये, viz, आद्य refers to सपिण्डीकरण which is the first of the śrāddhas for a deceased person in which three ancestors are invoked; आद्य may refer to पार्वण which is mentioned first by आश्व. गृ सू., or अनाद्य means अभोजन and so refers to आमश्राद्ध or हिरण्यश्राद्ध; or अनाद्ये means दुर्भिक्षे. The words एकैकमेकस्य...त्रींस्त्रीन्वा contradict आश्व. गृ. II. 5.11-12 'नवावरान् भोजयेत । अयुजो वा.'

II. 4.2.7-8 about offering food to pitṛs on amāvāsya.

## Number of Invitees

If five were invited two would be for gods and three for pitṛs; if seven, then four for gods and three for pitṛs and so on. Vas. XI. 27 ( = Manu III, 125 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 29), Yāj. I. 228, Matsya 17. 13-14, Viṣṇupurāṇa III. 15.14 provide that one must feed two brāhmaṇas at the rite for the gods and three for the manes or one only for each of the two purposes and even a rich man should not go in for a large company. The Padma purāņa (Sṛṣṭi 9.98 and 141) says the same thing. So the number of brāhmaṇas to be invited did not depend so much upon the means of the inviter, but upon the point whether the inviter would be able to honour them all properly and with ease. The idea was that at the same time when śrāddha was to be performed two brāhmaṇas should be fed for gods and three for the pitṛs. When only one brāhmaṇa could be invited or was available, Vas. (XI. 30-31) provides that portions of the several foods cooked should be put in a vessel and should be placed at the place where Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇa would have been seated, then served in a plate and the _viśve devāḥ_ be invoked and should be contemplated as present and then the food should be thrown into the fire or offered to a Vedic student (as alms) and then śrāddha rite should be continued. Śaṇkha[^906] 14.10 provides a similar rule. The result is that if a man can afford to invite only one brāhmaṇa or can secure one only, then that brāhmaṇa is meant for the rite in honour of pitṛs and the offering for the gods is to be cast into fire. Baud, Dh, S. II, 8.30, Manu TIL. 126, Vas. XI. 28, Kūrma (uttarārdha 22.28 ) contain the same verse which emphatically states 'A large company destroys these five _desiderata_, viz. the respectful treatment (of those invited), the securing of a proper place (such as one sloping to the south) and time, purity and (the choice of) meritorious brāhmaṇas; therefore one should not desire a large company'[^907].

[^906]: भोजयेदथवाप्येकं ब्राह्मणं पङक्तिपावनम्। दैवे कृत्वा तु नैवेद्यं पश्चाद्वह्नौ तु तत्क्षिपेत् ॥ शङ्ख 14.10. The श्रा.क.ल. p. 40 remarks 'एकब्राह्मणपक्षे विश्वेदेवस्थाने पात्रं प्रकल्प्य दैवे निवेद्य तमेकं विप्रं पित्रादिषु मातामहादिषु च नियुञ्जीत.' हेमाद्रि (श्रा. p. 1523 ) explains Vas. XI.31 as 'अन्नस्य प्रत्येकमेकदेशं समुद्धृत्य देवतायतने वश्वदावहिजोपवेशनोचिते स्थाने पात्रमासाद्य तत्र परिवेश्य तत्रत्यासनेच विश्वान देवानावाह्य तान् पुरोवर्तिन इवानुध्याय...विश्वेभ्यो देवेभ्य इदमन्नं स्वाहा ओं तत्सदिति उक्त्वा' &c. The translation in s. B. E, vol. 14 of देवतायतने in Vas.XI.31 (at p. 54 ) is wrong.

[^907]: सत्क्रियां देशकालौ च शौचं ब्राह्मणसम्पदः । पञ्चैतान विस्तरो हन्ति तस्मान्नेहेत विस्तरम् ॥ मनु. III. 126.

The Kūrmapurāṇa (uttarārdha 92.32) insists that an _atithi_ must be fed at a śrāddha or otherwise the śrāddha is not praiseworthy. Though these ancient works insisted upon the avoidance of large preparations and expenses for śrāddhas in honour of a deceased person, there were other smṛtis that favoured lavish distribution of wealth in śrāddhas. For exanıple, Bṛhaspati lays down: '(An heir) should lay aside half of the wealth that comes to him (by inheritance ) for the benefit of the deceased owner and should expend it in the monthly, six-monthly and yearly śrāddhas'. The Dāyabhāga XI. 12 approves[^908] of this and also quotes Ap. Dh. S. II. 6.13.3 "On the failure of a sapiṇḍa the teacher of the Veda takes the wealth of the deceased, on failure of the teacher, the pupil takes it and having inherited it he should employ it in the performance of works of charity for the benefit of the deceased' (or he himself may enjoy it). These passages show to what lengths the cult of benefit to the soul of the deceased was carried in India by certain writers. More practical authors such as Haradatta did not relish these extreme views. In several purāṇas such as the Vāyu[^908a] and Viṣṇu there are express directions that when a śrāddha is performed at Gayā, it should be on a profuse scale and no stinginess[^909] (lit. cheating in money matters ) in spending wealth should be shown there; otherwise the performer would not reap the benefit of the performance of śrāddha at that holy place.

[^908]: धनार्जनस्य हि प्रयोजनद्वयं भोगार्थत्वं दानाद्यदृष्टार्थत्वं च, तत्रार्जकस्य तु मृतत्वाद्धने भोग्यत्वाभावेनादृष्टार्थत्वमेव शिष्टम्। अत एव बृहस्पतिः। समुत्पन्नाद्धनादर्धे तदर्थे स्थापयेत्पृथक्। मासषाण्मासिके श्राद्धे वार्षिके च प्रयन्ततः।। दायभाग XI.13. आपस्तम्ब धर्मसूत्र II. 6.13.3 is: तदभावे आचार्य आचार्याभावे अन्तेवासी हृत्वा तदर्थेषु धर्मकृत्येषु वोपयोजयेत्।। हरदत्त explains 'वाशब्दात् स्वयं वोपयुञ्जीत',

[^908a]: वित्तशाठ्यं न कुर्वीत गयाश्राद्ध सदा नरः। वित्तशाठ्यं तु कुर्वाणो न तीर्थफल भाग्भवेत॥ वायु 82.19. This is quoted from another Purana by the स्मृतिच. (श्राद्ध) p. 388, which adds 'अतो वित्तानुसारेण शारीरबलानुसारेण च गयायां श्राद्धं कार्यम्'.

[^909]: सतिलं नामगोत्रेण दद्याच्छक्त्या च दक्षिणाम् ॥ गोभूहिरण्यवासांसि भध्यानि शयनानि च। दद्याद्यदिष्टं विप्राणामात्मनः पितुरेव च ॥ वित्तशाठ्येन रहितः पितृभ्यः प्रीतिमाहरन्। पद्मपुराण, सृष्टिखण्ड 9. 179-181.

## Lavish expenditure recommended

The Padmapurāņa appears to inculcate profuse expenditure of wealth in all śrāddhas. The Vāyupurāņa[^910] (82. 26-28 ) further says that the brāhmaṇas of Gayā are supermen, that when they are gratified (at a śrāddha) the gods together with pitṛs become gratified, that no question should be raised about the family, the character, the learning and the austerities (of the Gayā brāhmaṇas), that by honouring them a man attains liberation, that a man after honouring the brāhmaṇas should proceed according to his resources and strength to the performance of śrāddha; thereby he secures all heavenly desires and obtains the means of _Mokṣa_. The Skandapurāṇa goes so far as to say that Gayā brāhmaṇas even if they are depraved in their conduct and are backward deserve to be invited at śrāddha and are superior to brāhmaṇas who have mastered the Veda and Vedāngas. The Nirṇayasindhu (III. p. 401 ) notes that, according to the Tristhalisetu of his grandfather, this provision holds good only in the case of the śrāddha at the Akṣayya Vaṭa in Gaya and nowhere else. In modern times the brāhmaṇas at Gayā used to require the performer of śrāddha while he was in the sacred Phalgu river to make a declaration about his wealth and demanded fees accordingly, thereby carrying to the letter the words of the Vāyupurāṇa. Many people returned from Gayā thoroughly disillusioned and disgusted with the conduct of the brāhmaṇas at Gayā. In the Varāhapurāṇa[^911] it is said that two verses were sung by the pitṛs viz. 'Would such a blessed and intelligent man be born in our family who will offer piṇḍas (i.e. śrāddha) to us without being stingy about wealth and who would bestow on brāhmaṇas with reference to us (i.e. for our benefit) jewels, clothes, land, costly vehicles and all other kinds of wealth including water, when he has riches enough?' Here lavish expenditure on all śrāddhas (not only at Gayā. śrāddha) appears to be strongly recommended.

Devala provides that on the days of _śrauta_ sacrifices, of the celebration of charitable acts, of śrāddhas on the anniversary of death or on amāvāsyā, on lucky occasions (_vṛddhi_), on Aṣṭakā days, one should never give a frugal or poor dinner to[911a] the worthy brāhmaņas invited for dinner.

If no brāhmaṇa is available, then the Śrāddhaviveka, Śrāddhatattva and other digests say that effigies of brāhmaṇas made with seven or nine darbhas (except in the case of a performer following the Sāmaveda who is not restricted as to the number of darbhas) should be got ready and śrāddha should be performed and afterwards the fee and other materials may be given later on to other brāhmaṇas[^912].

Rules were laid from very ancient times about the method of inviting brāhmaṇas. The A.p. Dh. S. states[^912a] that the performer should make a request to the brāhmaṇas on the previous day, that on the day of the śrāddha he should request a second time (saying 'today is the śrāddha day') and then he should address them a third time (with the words 'food is ready, come'). Haradatta on the first of the three sutras explains that the request should be tomorrow there is a śrāddha, you should do me the favour of being in the place of the Āhavaniya fire' i.e. you should partake of the food that will be prepared.

## Time of Invitation

Manu III. 187 also says that the invitation should be on the previous day or on the day of the śrāddha itself. The Matsyapurāņa[^913] and Padma (Sṛṣti-khaṇḍa 9.85-88) provide that the person intending to perform a śrāddha should in an humble manner invite the brāhmaṇas on the previous day or (in the morning of the day of śrāddha, that he should touch the right knee (of the brāhmaṇa to be invited) with the words 'you are given this invitation by me' and repeat in their hearing the following observance 'you should be free from anger, should be intent on purity (of body and mind) and should abstain from sexual intercourse and I, the performer of śrāddha, shall also act in the same way and that the pitṛs in an aerial form wait upon the invited brāhmaṇas.' The Bṛhan-nāradīya-purāṇa states that the invitation should be in the words 'O best men! You should do me a favour and accept the invitation for śrāddha.' It is noteworthy that the Prajāpati-smṛti (63) prescribes that one should invite brāhmaṇas for a śrāddha or sacrifice for gods in the evening of the previous day after uttering the verse 'akrodhanaiḥ &c.'[^914] The Skandapurāņa VI. 217. 37 says that the performer should address the brāhmaṇa as follows: 'my father (is or will enter) into this your body and so will my grand-father; let him (the grand-father) come with his father and you should strictly observe the _vrata_' (the rules). The invitation to the brāhmaṇas representing pitṛs is to be given with the sacred thread in the _prācīnāvīta_ form and to those for Vaišvadevika in the _yajñopavīta_ form.

[^913]: पूर्वेद्युरपरेद्युर्वा विनीतात्मा निमन्त्रयेत्। निमन्त्रितान्हि पितर उपतिष्ठन्ति तान् द्विजान्। वायुभूतानु गच्छन्ति तथासीनानुपासते॥ दक्षिणं जानुमालभ्य त्वं मया तु निमन्त्रितः । एवं निमन्त्र्य नियमं श्रावयेत्पितृबान्धवान् ॥ अक्रोधनैः शौचपरैः सततं ब्रह्मचारिभिः। भवितव्यं भवद्भिश्च मया च श्राद्धकारिणा॥ मत्स्य 16. 17-20, q. by श्रा.क्रि. कौ. p. 81, श्राद्धतत्व p. 194. The verse निमन्त्रितान् occurs in मनु III. 189 (which reads वायुवच्चानुगच्छन्ति), हेमादि (श्रा. p. 763) quotes the verse दक्षिणं जानुं (but reads श्रावयेत् पैतृकान् बुधः) and स्मृतिच. (आ.) p. 406 quotes both. पद्मपुराण (सृष्टिखण्ड 9.85-88) has the same verses with some slight variations, Vide हेमाद्रि (on श्रा.) p, 1258.

[^914]: अक्रोधनैः शौचपरैरिति गाथामुदीरयन्। सायमामन्त्रयेद्विमान् श्राद्ध दैवे च कर्मणि ॥ प्रजापति 63. It is therefore likely that the Prajāpati-smṛti is much later than the Matsyapurana or it is possible that the verse अक्रोधनैः is an ancient one and only repeated by the मत्स्य. Compare मनु III. 192 Where we have the words 'अक्रोधनाः शौचपराः सततं ब्रह्मचारिणः'. नारदपुराण (पूर्वार्ध 28.20) puts the request as 'श्राद्धे क्षणस्तु कर्तव्यः प्रसादश्वेति सत्तम।'. This supports the Mit. on Yaj. I. 225.

On the question whether the Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇas were to be invited first or the brāhmaṇas for pitṛs were to be invited first there is a conflict among smṛtis and the medieval digests propose an option (vide Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1154-1157). Manu III. 205 appears to lay down that the daiva brāhmaṇa should be invited first (daivādyantam tad-iheta). Yama quoted by several digests[^915] says that the performer should request in the evening of the previous day brāhmaṇas with the words 'You should all be free from exertions and should avoid passion and anger for the śrāddha in my house which is to be performed tomorrow,' that the brāhmaṇas should reply 'let it be so if the night passes happily and without any mishap to us'. The digests (e.g. Śrāddhakriyākaumudi p. 81, Śrāddhatattva p. 194 and Nirṇayasindhu III, p. 804) say that the verse 'sarvāyāsa &c,' may be repeated when the invitation is given on the day previous to the day of śrāddha and the verse 'akrodhanaiḥ' when the invitation is given on the morning of the śrāddha day. The words of invitation differ according to different authorities. For example, according to the Mit. on Yāj. I. 225 the words are 'śrāddhe kṣaṇaḥ kriyatām.'. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 also, Manu III. 187 and 191 show that the words 'nimantraṇa' and 'āmantraṇa' are used as synonyms. In the Śrāddhasūtra[^916] of Kātyāyana the word 'āmantrana' is used. But Pānini[^917] (III. 3. 161) apparently makes a difference between the meanings of the two words and the Mahābhāṣya explains that invitation is called 'nimantraṇa' which if rejected (without proper cause) involves a fault or sin, while that invitation which one is free to reject (without incurring blame) is called 'āmantraṇa.' Therefore, it must be held that the few writers such as Kātyāyana who employ āmantraṇa use it in a secondary sense.

[^917]: विधिनिमन्त्रणामन्त्रणाधीष्टसंप्रश्नप्रार्थनेषु लिङ्ग । पाणिनि III. 3. 161. the महाभाष्य explains (Kielhorn, vol. II. p. 165) : यत्नियोगतः कर्तव्यं तन्निमन्त्रणम् किं पुनस्तत्। हव्यं कव्यं वा। ब्राह्मणेन सिद्धं भुज्यतामित्युक्तेऽधर्मः प्रत्याख्यातुः आमन्त्रणे कामचारः।' The श्रा. कि. को. p. 82, टोडरानन्द (श्राद्धसौख्य folio 51) and श्रादतत्व p. 192 refer to this distinction between the two words.

## Mode of inviting a brāhmaṇa

The invitation should be given by a performer himself or by his son, brother or a pupil or a brāhmaṇa, but it should not be given through a person of another _varṇa_[^918] or a woman or a child or person belonging to another _gotra_ nor from a distance (Prajāpati 64). Pracetas provides that a brāhmaṇa performer of śrāddha when giving an invitation should touch the right knee, a kṣatriya inviter the left knee of the invitee, a Vaiśya inviter should hold both feet of the invitee and a śūdra should prostrate himself at the feet of the invitee (vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 and S. K. L. p. 47 ). The Mārkaṇḍeya (28. 35) states an exception that if, when a śrāddha rite is going on, brāhmaṇas or Vedic students or ascetics come by chance begging for food, the performer should make them pleased by falling at their feet and feed them (i.e. no formal invitation is necessary in these cases). Vide Viṣṇupurāna III. 15. 12 for feeding uninvited ascetics. It is provided by Bhṛgu quoted by Hemādri that the brāhmaṇas on accepting the invitation should pronounce the finely-worded and comprehensive Vedic benediction quoted below[^919].

Ušanas[^919a] provides that the performer should wash the floor of his house with water, cowdung it and cleanse the vessels on the day previous to the śrāddha and then give an invitation to the brāhmaṇas with the words 'tomorrow I am going to perform śrāddha'. The Varāhapuraṇa and the Kūrma also provide for this and for the washing of the clothes. Manu III. 206 also requires that the spot where śrāddha is to be performed should be clean, secluded, cowdunged and should slope to the south.

(श्रा) p.403, श्रा.क्रि. को. p. 76, हेमाद्रि ( श्रा.) P. 1150, श्राद्धतत्व p. 192. हेमाद्रि explains 'आदिशब्दश्च प्रकारवचनः । तेन श्राद्धोपयोगिसम्भारसंपादनभाण्डमेलनशोधनादि गृह्यते'।

The Śrāddhasūtra of Katyāyana[^920] prescribes that a brāhmaṇa who has been invited (to a śrāddha dinner) by a faultless performer should not refuse the invitation nor should he, after being invited (and having accepted the invitation), accept a gift of even (uncooked) food from another person. Manu III. 190 and Kūrmapurāṇa provide that if a brāhmaṇa after receiving an invitation for a sacrifice to gods or manes according to śāstra directions and after having accepted it violates the appoint ment, he incurs sin and becomes a hog[^921] (in his next birth). This does not apply where he is unable to go on account of illness or other valid reason.

The smṛtis laid down some strict and elaborate rules which were to be observed by the brāhmaṇas invited for śrāddha and by the performer himself. Many of the rules are applicable to both. Gaut. prescribes[^922] that the brāhmaṇa who has partaken of śrāddha dinner should remain chaste (i.e. shun sexual intercourse) that whole day, and if he has intercourse with a wife of the śūdra caste he thereby makes his own _pitṛs_ stay in the ordure of that wife. Vas. XI. 37 makes this rule applicable both to the performer and the invited brāhmaṇa and as regards wives of all _varņas_. Manu III. 188 provides that the brāhmaṇa invited to dine at a sacrifice in honour of pitṛs and the performer of the śrāddha should remain controlled (i.e. chaste and free from anger and passion) and should not study the Veda (except _japa_). Yāj. I. 225 (latter half) briefly puts the matter by saying 'they should be controlled as to their bodies, speech and thoughts'. The Matsyapurāṇa[^923] prescribes that both the performer of śrāddha and the brāhmaṇa invited to dine at it should avoid dining again (after the śrāddha dinner), journey, going in a conveyance, exertions, sexual intercourse, study of the Veda, quarrel and sleeping by day.

## Rules for performer and invitee

Similar rules to observe continence are laid down for both on the day of śrāddha if invitation be given on the morning of the day of śrāddha and also on the previous day if invitation be given on the day previous to the śrāddha day. Vide Viṣṇu Dh. S. 69. 2-4, The Mit, on Yāj. I. 79 appears to strike a dissenting note about sexual intercourse with one's wife during the days from the 5th to the 16th; while most other medieval writers such as Hemādri (śr. pp. 1006-7) and Śr. P. p. 111 are opposed to this view. The Śrāddhasūtra[^924] of Kātyāyana provides that the performer should, from the time of giving invitation to the time when the brāhmaṇas sip water (i.e. perform _ācamana_ after śrāddha dinner), remain pure, free from anger, hurry, negligence, should speak the truth and should shun a journey, sexual intercourse, hard work and study of the Veda and control speech (should remain mostly silent) and the brāhmaṇas invited should observe the same rules. Aušanasa (Jiv. vol. I. pp. 526-527) contains verses very similar in import to Kātyāyana. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 106-108), Mārkaṇḍeya (28. 31-33) and Anušāsana 125.24 have identical verses[^925] and Vāyu 79.60-61 are very similar in import. Laghu-Śaṇkha 29, Laghu-Hārīta 75 and Likhita 60 have the same verse requiring the invited brāhmaṇas to avoid eight matters, viz. dining again, journey, carrying loads, Vedic study, sexual intercourse, making gifts, accepting gifts, performing homa, while Prajāpati 92 substitutes the brushing of the teeth (with a twig), _tāmbula_, bath after applying oil to the body, and fast for the first four of the above eight. The Anušāsanaparva (90. 12-13) and Padma (Pātālakhaṇḍa 101. 94-95) also contain a list of actions that should be avoided. Briefly put, the following were the observances for both inviter and invitee, viz. avoidance of sexual intercourse, dining again, falsehood, hurry, vedic study, heavy work, gambling, carrying burdens, giving gifts and acceptance of gifts, theft, journey, sleep by day, quarrels; the performer alone was to abstain from eating tambūla, shaving, applying oil to the body, brushing the teeth with a twig;

[^925]: श्राद्धं दत्त्वा च भुक्त्वा च पुरुषो यः स्त्रियं व्रजेत्। पितरस्तस्य तं मांसं तस्मिन्रतासि शेरते । अनुशासनपर्व 125.24. Almost the same words occur in मार्कण्डेय 28-
32-33 and in अनुशासन 90. 12-13, वसिष्ठ 11.37. The मिता. on या I. 79 says 'एवं गन्छन् ब्रह्मचार्येव भवति । अतो यत्र ब्रह्मचर्य श्राद्धादौ चोदितं तत्र गच्छतोऽपि न ब्रह्मचर्यस्खलनदोषोऽस्ति'.

while the brāhmaṇa invited was (alone) to observe the following, viz. not absenting oneself after accepting an invitation, making no delay when called for dinner (vide Śrāddhakalikā folio 4b and 5a and Pitṛ-bhakti on śrāddha[^926] ).

Elaborate provisions are made from ancient times about the substances and utensils proper for being used at śrāddha and about those that should not be used therein. Ap. Dh.[^927] S. remarks: 'the materials in śrāddha are sesamum, māṣas, rice, yavas (barley ), water, roots and fruits; but the pitṛs are extremely gratified by food that is mixed with clarified butter and for a very long time; so also they are gratified by wealth that is obtained lawfully and is bestowed on worthy persons'. Manu III. 267 ( =Vāyu 83.3) is to the same effect as Ap. Dh. S. Yāj. I. 258 is content to say that food which is fit to be offered in sacrifices (_haviṣya_) should be served. Manu III, 257 explains that food eaten by hermits in the forest, (cow's) milk, soma juice, meat that is not prepared with spices (or that is free from a bad smell), rock salt are by their very nature _havis_ (sacrificial food). According to Gaut. 27. 11 the sacrificial food (_havis_) comprises boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley (after being baked or fried), grain separated from husk, barley gruel, vege tables, milk, curds, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water[^928]. Other smṛtis and digests very much elaborated these brief indications in the early works. The three kinds of wealth (viz. _śukla_, _śabala_ and _kṛṣna_ ) and the several lawful or uncondemned means of acquiring wealth have been described already in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 130 ff. The Mārkaṇḍeya (29. 14-15) condemns the use in śrāddhas of wealth that is obtained by taking bribes or from a _patita_ (one guilty of a grave sin), that springs from bride-price or that is declared to be unlawful or is obtained by saying to another 'give me for the sake of a śrāddha to be offered to my father' (q. by Sm.C. on śrāddha p. 412).

## Materials to be employed

The Skandapurāṇa emphasizes that at a śrāddha purity (_śuddhi_) must be specially secured in seven matters viz. the body (of the performer), the materials, the wife, the place (where śrāddha is to be performed), the mind, the mantras and brāhmaṇas[^929]. Manu III. 235 (= Vas, 11.35) states: three are the sanctifying things in a śrāddha, viz. a daughter's son, a Nepal blanket and sesamum grains and three are commended in śrāddha viz, cleanliness, freedom from anger and absence of hurry[^929a]. Pracetas mentions several kinds of oorn that are commended as food in śrāddha. Manu III. 255 summarises that in śrāddha the riches (i.e. the most important matters) are afternoon, _darbhas_, proper cleansing of the place (or house) for śrāddha, sesame, generous expense (on food &c.), seasoning food, eminent brāhmaṇas.

The Mārkaṇḍeya-purāņa says that several kinds of corn yielding plants (some due to tillage in villages and some growing wild) were produced by Brahmā when he milked the earth for famished people, while Brahmavaivarta (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 537) affirms that when a few particles fell down on the earth while Indra drank. Soma, from them arose such corn as _śyāmāka_, wheat, _yava_, _mudga_ and red paddy and as they were produced from soma they were like nectar to the pitṛs and food prepared from these should be offered to pitṛs. The Mārkaṇḍeya speaks of seven kinds of _grāmya_ corn and seven kinds of wild (_āraṇya_) corn. Prajāpati 119 recommends the use of eight kinds of corn, viz. nivāra, māşa, mudga, wheat, paddy, yava, grain and sesamum, The Matsya (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 538) narrates that when the Sun drank nectar some drops fell down from which arose the several kinds of paddy, mudga, sugarcane and that therefore sugar is sacred and may be employed in sacrifices to gods and manes.

The पद्मपुराण (सृष्टिखण्ड 47. 278-279) has the whole verse but reads श्राद्ध त्रीणि...दौहित्रं and सत्यमक्रोधमत्वरा It appears clear from the preceding verse that in Manu at least दौहित्र means daughter's son. But in the स्कन्द (प्रभासखण्ड 205.14 ff ) several meanings of दौहित्र are given such as 'a vessel made of the horn on the nose of the rhinoceros' or 'clarified butter made from the milk of a cow of variegated colour.' The word कुतप also has nine meanings acc. to a Smṛti text quoted by Apararka p. 474 'बाह्मणः कम्बलो गावः सूर्योऽग्निस्तिथिरेव च। तिला दर्भाश्च कालश्च नवैते कुतपाः स्मृताः॥'; vide note 847 for कुतप.

 The Mārkaṇḍeya[^930] mentions several kinds of corn that may be employed for śrāddha food. The Brahma-purāṇa 220. 154-155, Vayu 82. 3, Viṣṇupurāṇa III. 16. 5-6, Viṣṇu, Dh. S., 931 Brahmāṇḍa II, 7. 143-152 and III. 14. contain similar lists of different kinds of corn that may be used in śrāddhas. The Vāyupurāņa (80. 42-48) mentions various desirable eatables prepared from corn of various kinds, sugar and clarified butter and milk[^932].

Certain kinds of corn and cereals were forbidden. For example, the Matsya-purāṇa and Padma (Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa, chap. 9. 62-66 )[^933] declare that masüra, linseed, niṣpāva, rājamāṣa, kusumbhika, kodrava, udāra, gram, kapittha, madhūka and linseed are forbidden. Viṣṇu Dh. S. 79.18 provides that the performer should avoid the bean called rājamāṣa, masüra, stale food and salt manufactured from seawater. The Ṣaṭ-trimśanmata[^934] forbids the use in śrāddha of all kinds of cereals covered with dark husk except sesamum, _mudga_ and _māşa_.

## What milk and water to be used

From considerations of space this matter cannot be pursued further. The Mit। on Yāj. I. 240 puts together a long list of allowed and of condemned kinds of grains and other articles.

What milk should be ordinarily partaken of and what should be avoided has been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 782-783. A few words are added here. Manu III, 271 and Yāj. I. 258 provide that if cow's milk or rice cooked therein (called _pāyasa_) is offered in śrāddha the pitṛs are satisfied for one year. Vāyu 78. 17, Brahma[^935] 220.169, Mārkandeya 32,17-19, Viṣṇupurāṇa III.16.11 forbid the use in a śrāddha of the milk of a she-buffalo, of a camari or female deer, of sheep or ewes, of she camels, of human females and of all animals with one hoof and the use of the curds and clarified butter prepared from such milk. But ghee prepared from buffalo milk was allowed by Sumantu and Devala (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 572).

The Mārkandeyapurāṇa[^936] (29.15-17), Vāyu (78.16) and Viṣṇupurāṇa (III, 16.10) lay down that the water to be employed in śrāddha must not have a bad smell, must not be foamy, or taken from a puddle or a small reservoir which cannot slake the thirst of a cow, must not have been brought overnight, must not be taken from a reservoir not dedicated to all or from a trough or the like meant for beasts.

Several rules are laid down about the fruits, roots and vegetables recommended or condemned for use in śrāddha. For example, the Brahma-purāņa (220.156-158 ) enumerates several kinds of fruits such as mangoes, _bilva_, pomegranate, cocoanut, dates, grapes, as fit to be given in śrāddha. Vide Śaṇkha 14.22-23 also. Vāyu (78.11-15 ) states[^936a] that garlic, leeks and onions, other things that are of bad odour or taste and all exudation from trees not permitted by the Veda and salt gathered from saltish earth, should be avoided in śrāddha.

(श्रा) p.416. In स्मृतिंच. (श्रा. p. 415) quotes a verse and a half from Suśruta for ten varieties of पलाण्डु.

The Viṣṇudharmasūtra[^937] (79.17) contains a long list of fruits, bulbs and vegetables that were not to be employed in śrāddha. The Rāmāyāna states[^938] that Rāma when an exile in the Dandaka forest gratified his pitṛs by offering the fruits of _inguda_, _badara_, and _bilva_ trees and generalises that deities are offered that food which is partaken of by a person (who is a devotee of That deity). From considerations of space detailed references to the smṛtis and purāņas are passed over. The Smṛtyarthasāra pp. 52-53, Śrāddhaviveka (pp. 43-47 ) of Rudradhara and other digests collect in one place the foods, vegetables, fruits and roots that are allowed to be offered in śrāddha and that are condemned in śrāddha. Manufactured salt was forbidden, but natural salt from a lake (called saindhava) was allowed. Salt was not to be served directly (as Viṣṇudharmasūtra 79.12 says) but when put in while cooking vegetables it was not prohibited. There was a difference of opinion about the employment of asafoetida (vide Hemādri on Śrāddha p. 565). The Viṣṇudharmasutra (79.5-6) provides that flowers having a strong (or nasty) odour or no odour at all, the blossoms of thorny plants and red flowers should not be given, but one may give white and sweet-smelling flowers even though they are taken from thorny plants and flowers though red in colour may be taken from aquatic plants. Śaṇkha (14. 15-16) is to the same effect (q. by Hemādri p. 684). Vāyu (75. 33-35) is to the same effect and adds that the flowers called Japā, Bhaṇḍi, Rūpikā (of arka plant), Kuraṇṭaka should be avoided in śrāddha. The Brahmapurāṇa (220.162 165 ) specifies the several kinds of flowers that may be offered in śrāddha such as jāti, campaka, mallikā, mango blossom, tulasi, tagara, ketaki and various kinds of lotuses ( white, blue and red &c.). The Smṛtyarthasāra includes _tulasi_ among things to be avoided in śrāddha.

The Sm. C. notes this and remarks that it is not clear on what this dictum prohibiting tulasi is based[^938a].

Kušas are required in śrāddha. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p.657 for general remarks on kuśas. A few words may be added here. The Sat. Br. VII, 2.3.2 states that the waters that loathed Vrtra went out to waterless deserts and became bushes of darbhas[^939]. Similarly, Ašv. Gr. III. 2.2 summarizes a Brāhmaṇa text stating that darbhas are the essence of waters and herbs (apām vā eṣa oṣadhinām raso yad-darbhāḥ). Prajapati (verse 98 )[^939a] provides that darbhas should be gathered from a pure spot in the morning by a brāhmaṇa, should have mantras repeated over them, should be greenish in colour, should be as long as a cow's ear and then they are holy. The Gobhila gr. (1. 5. 16-17) states the _barhis_ consists of kuśa grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main stalk and that the blades should be cut off near the roots at the rites meant for the Fathers'. Dakṣa (II, 33 and 35) provides that the second part of the day (divided into eight parts) is the proper time for collecting fuelsticks, flowers and kuśas. The Gobhilasmṛti (I. 20-21) says[^940] that the darbhas used in sacrifices are greenish, those to be used in Pākayajñas should be yellowish, those in rites for the pitṛs must be taken out from the roots and those that are to be used in Vaišvadeva should be dark-pale, and that greenish _darbhas_ together with ends uncut, that are smooth and well nourished, one _aratni_ in length and touched with that part of the hand called _pitṛtirtha_ are pure.

Vide वायुपुराण 75.38-39 for a similar verse.


The Padmapurāņa (Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa 11.92 ) and Skanda VII1. 205.16 state that kuśas and black sesamum spring from the body of Viṣṇu and the Viṣṇudharmottara I. 139.12 says that _tilas_ and _darbhas_ sprang from the perspiration and hair of Viṣṇu in the Boar incarnation. The Matsya ( 22.89 ) says the same.

The Garuda[^941] (Pretakhaṇḍa 2.21-22) states that all the three gods dwell in kuśa grass viz. Brahmā at its root, Viṣṇu in the middle and Śaṅkara at the end and that brāhmaṇas, mantras, kuśas, fire, tulası leaf--these do not become nirmālya (stale and so unfit to be used again ) even when the same are employed again and again. But an exception is made by Gobhila [^942] that those _darbhas_ which are spread on the ground for placing piṇḍas on them or that are used in _tarpaṇa_ and those that are held in the hand while a man is answering the calls of nature should be given up (and not used again). The Viṣņu Dh. S. 79.2 and Vāyu 75.41 provide that if kušas are not available, kāśa grass or Dūrvā may be substituted. The Skandapurāṇa VII (Prabhāsakhaṇḍa ) part 1.206.17 says that straight darbhas are used in giving gifts, at baths, in _japa_, _homa_, dinner and worship of gods, but they are double-folded when used in rites for pitṛs. The Skanda VII. 1. 205,16 provides that the top of darbhas is for divine rites, while darbha with the root and tip is meant for _paitṛka_ rites. This is based on the Sat. Br. II. 4. 2.17 which states that the top of the _darbha_ belongs to gods, the middle to men and the root part to the fathers.

Great importance was attached to the use of _tila_ (sesamum) in śrāddha. The Jaiminigṛhya II.1 states that the whole house should have sesamum grains scattered about in it. Baud. Dh. S. II. 8,8 provides that when the invited brāhmaṇas come they should be given water mixed with sesame. The Baud. gr. II. 11.64 provides that sesamum grains are holy in śrāddha for making gifts of them or as part of food or for being mixed in water.

## Use of sesame in śrāddha

The Prajapatismṛti speaks[^943] of four kinds of _tilas_ viz. white, black, very black and _jartilas_ and states that each succeeding one gives greater gratification to the pitṛs than each preceding one. The Tai.s.V. 4.3.2 refers to jartilas and Jai. X.8.7 holds a discussion thereon. The Naradapurāṇa (pūrvārdha 28.36)[^944] provides that the performer of śrāddha should scatter _tilas_ in the midst of the brāhmaṇas invited and at the doors with the mantra 'apahatā' (may the asuras and evil spirits that sit on the altar be struck and run away). Yaj. I. 234 also recommends this mantra ( which is Vāj. S. II. 29). The Kūrmapurāṇa (II. 22.18) states that sesame should be scattered all round and a goat should be tied near the spot, since śrāddha polluted by _asuras_ becomes purified by sesame and a goat. The Viṣṇupurāṇa (III. 16.14) prescribes that by tilas scattered on the ground one should ward off evil spirits (Yātudhāna ). The Garudapurāṇa[^945] ( Pretakhaṇḍa 2. 16 ) makes Śrikṛṣna say "tilas have sprung from the perspiration on my body and are holy; _asuras, dānavas and daityas_ run away on account of tilas". The Anuśāsana-parva (90.22 ) says that _yātudhānas_ and goblins snatch away the _havis_ when the śrāddha is offered without _tilas_. The Kṛtyaratnākara (p. 540 ) quotes a verse as follows: 'he who applies as unguent _tilas_, who bathes with water in which _tilas_ are mixed, offers _tilas_ into fire, makes gifts of _tilas_, eats _tilas_ and who grows _tilas_-these six never sink (i. e. are not unlucky nor in trouble ).

A great deal is said about the vessels to be used in offering _arghya_ (water for honouring the invited brāhmaṇas and piṇḍas), for cooking śrāddha food, for dining and for serving. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana[^946] provides that the arghya water should be taken in camasas (cups ) made of sacrificial trees (such as palāśa, aśvattha, udumbara ) or in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn, precious stones whichever may be available, or in a vessel made of leaves.

[^943]: शुक्लः कृष्णः कृष्णतरश्चतुर्थो जर्तिलास्तलः। उत्तरोत्तरतः श्राद्धे पितृणां तृप्तिकारकाः॥ प्रजापति 99. जर्तिलs are wild tilas. The तै. सं.V.4.3.2 has this passage 'जर्तिलयवाग्वा वा जुहयादग्वीधुकयवाग्वा न ग्राम्यान् पशून् हिनस्ति नारण्यानथो खल्वाहुर नाहुतिर्वै जर्तिलाश्च गवीधुकाश्चेत्यजक्षीरेण जुहोति'. शबर appears to quote काठकसंहिता The conclusion arrived at by Jai. X. 8.7 is that the passage about जर्तिलs is an अर्थवाद for praising पयोहोम. The स्मृतिच. (श्राद्ध) p. 433 says जर्तिलास्तु तिलाः प्रोक्ताः कृष्णवर्णा वने भवा इति सत्यव्रतेनाभिधानात्.

## Vessels to be used at śrāddha

The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (179. 14-15) provides that the performer should employ metallic vessels, particularly vessels made of silver. The Mārkaṇḍeya (31.65) and Vāyu (74.3) state that in a vessel of silver the (ancient) pitṛs milked _svadhā_ and hence a silver vessel is highly desired by pitṛs and brings delight to them. Yăj. I. 237 also specially recommends silver vessels. The Vāyu (74. 1-2), Matsya (17. 19-22), Brahmāṇḍa (Upodghāta 11. 1-2) and Padma (Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa 9. 147-150) state that vessels of gold, silver or copper are the (proper) ones for pitṛs; that even the talk about silver or the sight or gift of silver gives inexhaustible results to pitṛs in heaven, that vessels to be used for _arghya_, for piṇḍa and for the food to be offered should be preferably of silver and that in rites for gods a silver vessel is not auspicious. Atri (q. by Sm. C. II, p. 464) says that in rites for the gods and pitṛs, vessels of gold and silver should be respectively employed and in default of these vessels of other metals (such as copper, bell-metal) should be used (as stated by Viṣṇu Dh. S. 79.22 and 24). The Padma provides[^947] that the vessels may be of sacrificial wood or of _palāśa_ or of silver or made from a sea product (such as conch shell) and that since silver was produced from the eye of Śiva, it is a great favourite with pitṛs. Prajāpati (111) provides that the three piṇḍas should be cast in a vessel of gold or silver or copper or bell metal or of rhinoceros horn but not in earthenware or a wooden vessel, that (verse 112) the cooking vessels should be of copper or of any metal, but an earthen vessel baked in fire and immersed in water is the best (for cooking), that food cooked in an iron vessel is like crow's flesh, that (115) the vessels to be used for taking food by the brāhmaṇas should be made of gold, silver or of an alloy of five metals or they may take their food in _patrāvali_ (i.e. leaves stitched together);

[^947]: पात्रं वनस्पतिमयं तथा पर्णमयं पुनः॥ राजतं वा प्रकुर्वीत तथा सागरसम्भवम् । सौवर्णे राजतं पात्रं पितॄणां पात्रमिष्यते । ...वार्यपि श्रद्धया दत्तमक्षयायोपकल्पते ॥ अर्घार्थे पितृपिण्डेषु पितॄणां राजतं स्मृतम् ।...शिवनेत्रोद्भवं यस्मादतस्तत्पितृवल्लभम् । पद्म ( सृष्टिखण्ड 9. 147-151); तथार्घ्यपिण्डभोज्यादौ पितॄणां राजतं मतम् । शिवनेत्रो...वल्लभम् । अमङ्गलं तद्यत्नेन देवकार्येषु वर्जयेत् ॥ मत्स्य 17. 22-23.

vide also Matsya 17. 19-20. The use of plantain leaves for bhojana is forbidden[^947a] by some. Brāhmanas should not take _ācamana_ from a vessel made of bell-metal, kharpara, śukra, stone, clay, wood, fruit or iron. Ācamana should be performed with water from a copper vessel. Atri (153) prescribes that no food should be served from an iron vessel, if so served the food is like ordure to the diner and the server goes to hell. The vessels for cooking śrāddha food are to be made of gold, silver, copper or bellmetal or even of clay provided the last are new ones and strong(well baked) but never of iron. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 155 for details. The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (79. 24) quotes a verse which says that food offered in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or of _phalgu_ wood becomes inexhaustible.

Viṣṇu Dh. S. 79. 11 provides that for unguents (_anulepana_) to be applied to the bodies of the invited brāhmaṇas, sandalwood, saffron, camphor, _aguru_, _padmaka_ may be used. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 165-166) mentions kuṣṭha, jaṭā-māṅsi, nutmeg, uśīra, mustā and some others as proper perfumed articles to be used at śrāddhas.

It has already been seen at pp. 413-14 what kinds of food were recommended or condemned for śrāddha. The Matsyapurāņa[^948] states that food containing milk and curds and clarified butter from cow's milk mixed with sugar gives satisfaction to all pitṛs for one month and that whatever food, whether cow's milk or ghee or rice cooked in milk, is mixed with honey, yields inexhaustible results. The Brahmapurāṇa also ( 220. 182-184) provides that such eatables as are sweet and oily and are slightly sour and pungent should be served in śrāddha and one should shun eatables that are very sour or very saltish or very pungent, since they are _āsura_ (fit for _asuras_).

[^947a]: यत्वाङ्गिरसोक्तम् 'न जातिकुसुमानि न कदलीपत्रम्' इति कदलीपत्रमत्र भोजनमिति पात्रतया प्राप्तं निषिध्यते । स्मृतिच. (श्रा) p. 434. Others said that there is an option as to कदलीपत्र, as certain smrtis (e.g. लघ्वाश्वलायन 23.42) allowed plantain leaves. ब्रह्माण्ड (उपोद्धातपाद 21. 35-40) mentions that the leaves of पलाश, अश्वत्थ, उदुम्बर, विकङ्कत, काश्मर्य, खदिर, प्लक्ष, न्यग्रोध, बिल्व may be used for taking food in and that vessels made of Phalgu wood, o Bilva wood and bamboo are allowed and yield certain good rewards.

[^948]: अन्नं सदधिक्षीरं गोघृतं शर्करान्वितम् । मासं प्रीणाति वै सर्वान् पितृनित्याह केशवः ...यक्तिश्चिन्मधुसंमिश्रं गोक्षीरं घृतपायसम्। दत्तमक्षयमित्याहुः पितरः पूर्वदेवताः॥ मत्स्य 17. ३0-36, the first being q. by स्मृतिच. (श्रा.) p. 431.

Great emphasis was laid on serving preparations of food made from _māşa_ beans. The Aušanasa[^949] -smṛti pronounces the threat that the brāhmaṇa, who, when dining at śrāddha, does not eat māṣa food, becomes a beast for twenty-one births after death. The Sm. C. quotes a smṛti text saying that a śrāddha in which no māṣa preparation is offered is as good as not performed.

## Serving flesh at śrāddha

The greatest divergence has prevailed about the employment of flesh at śrāddhas among writers from the earliest times. The subject of flesh-eating in general has been discussed at great length in the History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. II, pp. 772-782. A few remarks about flesh in relation to śrāddha will not be out of place here. The Ap. Dh. S. prescribes[^950] that the obligatory śrāddha (to be performed every month) must contain food mixed with fat, the best course (for supplying fat) is to employ clarified butter and flesh; on failure of these two, sesamum oil and vegetables may be employed. The same sūtra also provides[^951] that the pitṛs are gratified for a year by the offering of cow's flesh in a śrāddha, that by the flesh of a buffalo the gratification of pitṛs extends to more than a year, that this rule extends to the flesh of wild animals (like hares) and village (or domesticated) animals (like goats) that are declared to be fit for being sacrificed, that the gratification of pitṛs extends to endless time if the flesh of a rhinoceros is offered to brāhmaṇas seated on rhinoceros skin, so also by the flesh of the fish called 'śatabali' and the flesh of a _Vārddhrīṇasa_.

[^949]: यो नाश्नाति द्विजो माषं नियुक्तः पितृकर्मणि । स प्रेत्य पशुतां याति सन्ततामेकविंशतिम् ॥ औशनसस्मृति (V.) p. 531 ( Jiv. I.).

[^950]: नैयमिकं तु श्राद्धं स्नेहवदेव दद्यात्। सर्पिर्मासमिति प्रथमः कल्पः। अभावे तैलं शाकमिति । आप.ध. सू. II. 8. 19. 13-15.

[^951]: संवत्सरं गव्येन प्रीतिः। भूयांसमतो माहिषेण। एतेन ग्राम्यारण्यानां पशूनां मांसं मेध्यं व्याख्यातम्। खड्गोपस्तरणे खड्गमांसेनानन्त्यं कालम् । तथा शतबलेर्मत्स्यस्य मांसेन वार्ध्राणसस्य च । आप.ध. सू. II. 7.16.25-II.7.17.3. वार्ध्राणस or वार्ध्रीणस is explained as a red-coloured goat that is _tripiba_ (whose ears are so long that they touch the water it drinks), that is old and the foremost of the herd. त्रिपिबमिन्द्रियक्षीणं यूथस्याग्रचरं तथा। रक्तवर्ण तु राजेन्द्र छागं वार्ध्रीणसं विदुः ॥ विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 141.48 q. by स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 431). The Mit. On या. I. 260 and मेधातिथि on मनु. III. 271 quote a slightly different verse: त्रिपिबमिन्द्रियक्षीणं श्वेतं वृद्धमजापतिम् । वार्ध्रीणसं तु तं प्राहुर्याज्ञिकाः श्राद्धकर्मणि ॥ and Mit, explains त्रिपिब as 'पिबतः कर्णौ जिह्वा च यस्य जलं स्पृशान्ति स त्रिभिः पिबतीति त्रिपिबः'. अपरार्क p. 552 cites this verse as a निगम. हेमाद्रि (श्रा.p.590) states that the 2nd verse is a various reading of the first. अपरार्क p. 553 quotes another verse according to which वार्ध्रीणस is a white-feathered bird with red head and dark throat 'कृष्णग्रीवो रक्तशिराः श्वेतपक्षो विहङ्गमः । सवै वार्ध्रीणसः प्रोक्त इत्येषा नैगमी श्रुतिः॥. Several forms are met with in printed works viz. वार्ध्रीणस or वार्ध्राणस or वाध्रीणस. The दीपकलिका gives the two explanations of वार्ध्रीनस (this is the reading of the printed work) as a white goat and as a bird.

Vas. XI. 34 contains the following remarkable Verse: 'an ascetic, when invited in a rite for the gods or pitṛs, who avoids (does not partake of) flesh, dwells in Hell for as many years as the number of hair (on the body of the animal whose flesh he avoids).' Even the Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa (T. 140. 49–50) emphatically asserts that he who does not partake of flesh-food in a row of diners at a śrāddha which has been properly employed goes to hell. Manu V. 35 and Kūrma II. 17.40 contain a similar verse applicable to all those who are invited as brāhmaņas at a śrāddha. The Kūrmapurāņa II. 22.75 provides that the brāhmaṇa who is employed for the performance of a śrāddha and does not eat flesh offered therein becomes a beast for 21 births. Manu III. 257 states that the following are said to be proper offerings in a śrāddha by their very nature viz. food (prepared from _nīvāra_ grain and the like) fit for a forest hermit, milk, soma juice, flesh that does not emit foul smell and unmanufactured salt. An ascetic was ordinarly required not to partake of flesh; but Vasiṣṭha insisted on his partaking of it when invited at a śrāddha.

Manu IIT. 267-272, Yāj. I. 258–260, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 80.1 ff, Anušāsanaparva chap. 88, the Śrāddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kandikās, 7-8), Kūrmapurāṇa II, 20.40-42, 29. 2-8, Vāyu 83. 3-9, Matsya 17. 31-35, Viṣṇupurāṇa III. 16.1-3, Padmapurāṇa (Sṛṣṭi 9. 158-164 ), Brahmapurāṇa 220.23-29, Viṣṇudharmottara I. 141.42-47 state at length the periods of time for which pitṛs are gratified by the flesh of certain animals being served at a śrāddha. The verses of Yāj. being the shortest in all these works are given below. Yāj.[^952] states; Pitṛs are gratified by the serving of sacrificial food (such as rice, fruits, roots & c.) for a month, for a year by (cows's milk or ) rice cooked in cow's milk, for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 months respectively by the flesh of fishes (pāthina), of (red coloured) deer, of a ram, of a bird (such as a _tittiri_), of a goat, of a spotted deer, of a dark-coloured deer, of a _ruru_ deer, of a wild boar, of a hare; the offering of rhinoceros flesh, of a fish called Mahāśalka, of honey, of food fit for hermits (wild corn such as _nīvāra_), the flesh of a red goat, of Mahāśāka (i. e. Kālašāka), and the flesh of Vārdhrīnasa--these secure inexhaustible fruit.  

[^952]: हविष्यान्नेन वै मासं पायसेन तु वत्सरम् । मात्स्यहारिणकौरभ्रशाकुनच्छागपार्षतैः॥ ऐणरारैंववाराहशाशैर्मासैर्यथाक्रमम् । मांसवृद्धचाभितृप्यन्ति दत्तैरिह पितामहाः। खड्गामिषं महाशल्कं मधु मुन्यन्नमेव वा। लोहामिषं महाशाकं मांसं वार्ध्रीणसस्य च॥ यद्ददाति गयास्थश्च सर्वमानन्त्यमश्नुते। या. I. 258-261. महाशाकं is explained as कालशाकं the मिताक्षरा, while the स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 431) frankly admits that it does not know what कालशाकं is: 'कालशाकं कीदृशमिति न विघ्न:1'.

There is some divergence of views among the several works. For example, Manu III. 267 and 271, Katyāyana (in śrāddhasūtra 7 ) appear to hold that by offering food prepared from village corn (such as rice, māṣa & c.) or wild eatables (such as _nīvāra_ or fruits and roots) the gratification is only for one month and the flesh of Vārdhriṇasa produces gratification for twelve years only (and not for all time ). Viṣṇu Dh, S. 80.10 and Manu III. 270 bring in buffalo flesh and tortoise flesh as giving gratification for ten and eleven month respectively. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 590 )[^953] is careful to point out that these words about the duration of time are not to be taken literally but what is really intended is to convey greater and greater gratification of the pitṛs according to the kind of flesh offered. Pulastya quoted by the Mit. and Aparārka p. 555 provides that a brāhmaṇa should generally or mainly offer at a śrāddha hermit's food, a kṣatriya or a vaiśya should offer flesh, a śūdra should offer honey and all varṇas may offer anything else (except these three) which is not forbidden[^954]. Whoever may be the offerer, the eater at a śrāddha dinner was to be a brāhmaṇa alone and so it follows that brāhmaṇas invited to a śrāddha by a kşatriya or vaiśya had to eat flesh. Yet it is remarkable that even the Mitākṣarā and the Kalpataru written about 1100-1120 A. D. do not expressly say that in the Kali age flesh-eating at śrāddha is totally prohibited at least for brāhmaṇas. It has been shown already (H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 775-776) that even when animal sacrifices were the order of the day in the Ṛgveda and the Brāhmaṇas there was an undercurrent of thought that the offerings of fuel-sticks or of boiled rice when made with heart felt devotion to the gods were as good as flesh offerings for securing their favour.

[^953]: इह सर्वत्र प्रीत्यतिशयो विवक्षितः। न तु यथाश्रुत एव कालः। तथा सति द्वादशवर्षपर्यन्तं पितृणां तृप्तत्वात् श्राद्धाकरणे प्राप्ते सति न 'प्रतिवर्ष यत्नात्कार्यम्। इत्येतद्वचनं  विरुध्यत इति हरिहरादयः । हेमाद्रि (श्रा. p. 590).

## Use of flesh in modern times

In course of time that conception grew stronger and stronger, so much so that Manu (V. 27-44 and V.46-47) and Vasiṣṭha appear to be in two minds (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 778–780). Gradually the offering of flesh in Madhuparka and in śrāddhas came to be totally condemned in works of the 12th and 13th centuries and onwards as a matter prohibited in the Kali age (Varātithipitṛbhyaśca pašūpākaraṇakriyā). (Vide H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 945-946 and p. 964). Now except among the brāhmaṇas (in Northern India ) who have no objection to include fish in diet as permissible to them no brāhmaṇa offers flesh in śrāddha. The usage of Northern India would be in accordance with the view set out in Bṛhannāradiya-purāṇa that one should offer honey, flesh and other things according to the usage of the country, as explained by the Pṛthvicandrodaya.

Manu ( V.11-18) contains long lists of animals, birds and fishes whose flesh was not to be eaten even by those who were flesh-eaters.

If a person is destitute, some of the Purāṇas such as the Viṣṇu (III. 4.24-30) and the Varāha (13,53-58) mercifully provide in identical[^955] verses that instead of entertaining brāhmaṇas with a sumptuous dinner or flesh the poor man may offer only uncooked corn, or some vegetables growing wildly or some slight _dakṣiṇā_ if he cannot offer even uncooked food or vegetables, or he may offer a few grains of sesamum (7 or 8 ) to a brāhmaṇa with water in his folded hands, or grass to a cow enough for one day and if he cannot afford even any one of these, then he may repair to a thicket of trees, raise his arms so that his armpits are exposed and loudly address the guardians of the worlds such as the Sun in the following words: 'I have neither wealth nor money nor anything else fit to be offered by way of śrāddha; I bow to my pitṛs; may the pitṛs be satisfied by my devotion; I have stretched these arms in space!' (lit. the path of the wind).

[^955]: असमर्थोन्नदानस्य धान्यं मांसं स्वशक्तितः।...सर्वाभावे वनं गत्वा कक्षमूलप्रदर्शकः। सूर्यादिलोकपालानामिदमुच्चैः पठिष्यति ॥ न मेऽस्ति वित्तं न धनं न चान्यच्छाद्धस्य योग्यं स्वपितृन्नतोऽस्मि। तृप्यन्तु भक्त्या पितरो मयैतौ भुजी ततौ वर्मनि मारुतस्य ॥ वराहपुराण. 13. 57-58 = विष्णुपुराण III. 14.29-30, q. by मद. पा. pp. 515-16 from विष्णु and by निणयसिन्धु III. p.467 from both. This passage explains the origin and the present meaning of the Marathi phrase खाका वर करणे. बृहत्पराशर (chap.5 p.152) has similar provisions. The पृथ्वी (folio 56 b) notes 'धान्यं मांसमित्यत्र वन्यं शाकामिति वराहपुराणीयः पाठः'; in the printed विष्णुपुराण the reading is not धान्यं मांसं, but the निर्णयसिन्धु had these words and it appears that the text was tampered with in modern times.

It is now time to describe the procedure of the PārvaņaŚrāddha[^955a] which is the pattern or norm (prakṛti) of the other śrāddhas[^956] (even including the _Aştakās_). Here one meets with great divergences of views even from the times of the sūtras up to modern times. Though the main items and stages in the rite of śrāddha are generally the same, there is variation in the mantras, the details and sometimes in the order of the several items. Kātyāyana lays down that every man has to follow his own _sūtra_ as to the use of the word 'svāhā' or the words 'svadhā namaḥ', as to wearing the sacred thread in the yajñopavita or prācīnāvita way and as to the number of _āhutis_[^957].

It would be very interesting first to find out the vestiges of the sacrifice to the fathers in the most ancient Vedic texts. The Tai, S. (I. 8. 5. 1-2) deals[^958] with the Mahāpitṛyajña performed in Sākamedha, the third of the four Cāturmāsyas: "He offers to Soma accompanied by the pitṛs a cake baked on six potsherds, to the pitṛs Barhiṣadaḥ (sitting on darbha grass or in a yajña) fried grains, for the pitṛs called Agniṣvātta he milks a drink from a cow which has to be won over (to another calf). This for thee, O father and for those who come after thee (i.e. for thy descendants); this for thee, O grandfather, great-grandfather and for those who come after thee; do, yo Pitṛs rejoice in your portions. May we gladden thee, O Indra, that castest thy glance at us, come forth now with full chariot seat; being praised (by us) thou goest to places desired by you. Yoke, O Indra, thy two bay steeds. They (_pitaraḥ_) have eaten, they have rejoiced, the dear ones have dispelled (evil); the radiant sages have been praised with newest hymn, Yoke, O Indra, thy two bay steeds. The pitṛs have eaten, the pitṛs have rejoiced, the pitṛs have been glad, the pitṛs have purified themselves. Go away, O Pitṛs, that art soma-loving by your majestic ancient paths. Then reach ye the _pitṛs_ that well know you (or everything) and that revel in the company of Yama."

[^955a]: Terms already explained such as _'Pārvaṇa'_ and _'Ekoddiṣṭa'_ are not explained again, Vide n. 855 above for those two words. Śrāddha on amavasya, is obligatory (_nitya_) as laid down by Gaut. 15.1 q. in note 935 above, while the śrāddhas performed on the other tithis of the dark half of a month are _kāmya_.

[^956]: The अनाकुला of हरदत्त on आप. गृ. 21.1 states 'पुनरपि पाकयज्ञानन्तरं पुरुषत्रयसंप्रदानकं तादृशानामष्टकादीनां प्रकृतिभूतं मासिकसंज्ञकं पित्र्यं कर्मोपदिश्यते.'

I. 6.8 "अभिवान्यायै दुग्धे भवति सा हि पितृदेवयं दुहे' and explains 'मृताः पुरुषाः पितरो भवन्ति । अभिवान्या च मृतवत्सेति सजातीयत्वात्तत्र तेषां प्रीतिः. The milk of an अभिवान्या cow is kept in a vessel in which are put half-ground barley grains, then the milk is stirred once or thrice with a piece of sugarcane to which a string is tied. This preparation is called मन्थ. Vide मैत्रायणीसंहिता 1. 10. 17 (यदेष मन्थस्तेन पितृयज्ञोऽभिवान्याया गोर्दुग्धे स्यात्...इक्षुशलाकयोपमन्थति) आप.श्री. 8.14.14. The Tai. Br. (I. 6. 8-9) expounds the above Tai.S. passage in its own way. The two verses सुसंदृशं and अक्षन्नमीमदन्त are वाज.सं.III. 52 and 51 and are the same as मै. सं. I. 10.3. तै. बा. II. 6.16 brings together the mantras employed in पिण्डपितृयज्ञ as याज्या, पुरोनुवाक्या or सामिधेनी verses.

In the Tai.[^959] Br. I.2.10 the Piṇḍapitṛyajña is dealt with at some length. In the note below the important passages are set forth leaving out the legends, repetitions and matters not relevant to our purpose: "Therefore the rite (called piṇḍa pitṛyajña) is performed the day previous (to the Darśeṣṭi).

[^959]: तस्मात्पितृभ्यः पूर्वेद्युः क्रियते।...सोमाय पितृपीताय स्वधा नम इत्याह ।...अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नम इत्याह । य एव पितॄणामग्निस्तं प्रीणाति। तिस्र आहुतीर्जुहोति त्रिर्निदधाति षट्सम्पद्यन्ते। षड् वा ऋतवः। ऋतूनेव प्रीणाति ।...ऋतवः खलु वै देवाः पितरः ।... सकृदाच्छिन्नं बर्हिर्भवति। सकृदिव हि पितरः। त्रिनिंदधाति । तृतीये वा इतो लोके पितरः । तानेव प्रीणाति । पराङावर्तते। ह्रीका हि पितरः। ओष्मणो व्यावृत उपास्ते। उष्मभागा हि पितरः।... अवघेयमेव तन्नेव प्राशितं नेवामाशितम् । वीरं वै पितरः प्रयन्तो हरन्ति । वीरं वा ददति । दशा छिनत्ति । हरणभागा हि पितरः। पितृनेव निरवदयते। उत्तर आयुषि लोम छिन्दीत। पितृणामेर्तहि नेदीयः। नमस्करोति। नमस्कारो हि पितॄणाम् । नमो वः पितरो रसाय नमो वः पितरः शुष्माय । नमो वः पितरो जीवाय। नमो वः पितरः स्वधायै। नमो वः पितरो मन्यवे । नमो वः पितरो घोराय। पितरो नमो वः ।...एष वै मनुण्याणां यज्ञः। देवानां वा इतरे यज्ञाः। ते. बा. I. 3. 10. 1-10. The words नमो वः पितरो रसाय to पितरो घोराय occur in वाज. सं. II. 32 and मै. सं. I, 10.3 but in a slightly different order and वाज. सं. reads शोषाय for शुष्माय. It may be noted that though the तै. बा. speaks of three ahutis it mentions only two deities; the third is supplied by the सूत्रकार in the words यमायाङ्गिरस्पते पितृमते स्वधा नमः ।. vide note 781 above. On 'देवाः पितरः' । सायण says 'द्विविधा हि पितरः देवात्मका मनुष्यात्मकाश्च । पितृलोकस्वामिनो देवात्मकाः । मृताः सन्तो भोगात्तल्लोकं माता मनुष्यात्मकाः'. On वीरं...ददति, सायण explains 'वैकल्ये पुत्र भारयन्ति साकल्ये पुत्रं प्रयच्छन्ति । अत्र वैकल्यस्य दुष्परिहरत्वेन पुत्रप्रत्याम्नायत्वेन वस्त्राग्रमीषत्सूत्रं छित्वा पिण्डेषु निदध्यात्'.

He says 'to Soma drunk by the pitṛs, _svadhā!_ Adoration!' He says to Agni, the carrier of _kavya_, svadhā! Adoration ! (Thereby ) he pleases the fire that pertains to the pitṛs. He offers (into fire ) three oblations; he puts down (on the darbhas spread on the ground) three piṇḍas. (These) thus come to six in number. Six indeed are the seasons. He (thereby) pleases the seasons. The seasons are indeed the shining (or divine) pitṛs......The darbha grass is cut with one stroke; the pitṛs have as it were (passed away) once for ever. He puts down thrice (the piṇḍas). The pitṛs are indeed in the third world from here. He (thereby) pleases them. He (the performer) turns his face away to the north from the south), for the Fathers are shy. He remains with his face turned away till the steam (of the boiled rice of the piṇḍas) ceases to rise, for the Fathers have the steam of rice as their share; he should simply gmell (the piṇḍas). That as if does not amount to eating or non-eating. The pitřs when departing (from the śrāddha rite) take away or grant a valiant son. He cuts off the fringe (of a garment to place it on the piṇḍas), for the share of Fathers is taking away (what is offered). He (thereby) allots their proper share to the pitṛs (and dismisses them). When the performer) is in the latter part of life (i. e, over 50 years of age) he cuts off hair (from his chest instead of presenting a _daśa_). At that time he is nearer to the pitṛs (when above 50 years of age). He offers adoration, because adoration (_namaskāra_) is dear to the pitṛs. Adoration to you, O Fathers, for vigour; adoration to you, O fathers, for life; adoration to you, O fathers, for _svadhā_; adoration to you, O fathers, for ardour; adoration, O fathers, for the terrible! O fathers! here is adoration to you. This (piṇḍapitṛyajña) is indeed a sacrifice of men (i.e. sacrifice to departed men) and other sacrifices belong to the gods.' In the Tai. Br. I. 4. 10 the Pitṛyajña performed in _sākamedha_ is praised (in 2) and further on it is said that Ṛtus (seasons) are pitṛs and they offered pitṛyajña to Prajāpati, their father. This passage supports the provision made in Manu and some of the digests that the Ṛtus are to be identified with pitṛs and obeisance is to be made to them[^960].

[^960]: तस्मात्साकमेधैर्यजमानः इदावत्सरीणां स्वस्तिमाशास्त इत्याशासीत । यत्पितृयज्ञेन यजते देवानेव तदश्ववस्यति । 2...अथर्तवः पितरः प्रजापति पितरं पितृयज्ञेनायजन्त। त एतं लोकमजयन् यस्मिनृतवः। यत्पितृयज्ञेन यजते एतमेव लोकं जयति यस्मिनृतवः । ऋतूनामेव सायुज्यमुपैति । ते. बा. I. 4.10.8. The word पितृयज्ञ here and in ते. सं. 12.2.3,मै.सं.1.10.17 (यदेष पितृयज्ञस्तेनैवास्य पितरोऽभीष्टाः प्रीता भवन्ति) ) means a sacrifice offered to the manes, while it is doubtful whether in Ṛg.X.16. 10 the word पितृयज्ञ means the same thing. But as the verse that immediately follows (Ṛg.X. 16.11) mentions pites in the plural, it looks as if the meaning of पितृयज्ञ being well known was used in a secondary sense in Ṛg.X.16.10 .

## Piṇḍapitṛyajña in sat. Br.

The Sat. Br. (II. 4. 2) contains the following somewhat fuller account of the Piṇḍa-pitṛyajña, omitting legendary or other irrelevant matters :-When the moon is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (the performer of the Darśa sacrifice) presents food to the Fathers in each month ...... He presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon indeed belongs to the gods; the midday to men; and the afternoon to the Fathers; therefore he presents (food to the Fathers) in the afternoon. While seated behind the Gārhapatya fire with his face turned towards the south and the sacred thread on his right shoulder he takes that material (for the offering from the cart). Thereupon he rises from thence and threshes the rice while standing north of the Dakşiņa fire and facing the south. Only once does he clean the rice, for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away. He then boils it. While it stands on the Dakşiņa fire) he pours some clarified butter on it. After removing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two oblations in the fire ...... Here he is engaged in a sacrifice to the Fathers; hence he thereby propitiates the gods and being permitted by the gods, he presents that food to the Fathers. He offers to both Agni and Soma ... He offers with the formula To Agni, the carrier of _kavya_ (what is offered to the Manes), svāhā!', 'To Soma accompanied by the Fathers, svāhā!' (Vāj. S. II 29). He then puts the pot-ladle (mekşaṇa) on the fire, that being in lieu of the Sviṣṭakṛt. Thereafter he draws (with the _sphya_, the wooden sword) one line south of the Dakşiņa fire, that being in lieu of the altar. He then lays down a firebrand at the further (south) end of the line. For, were he to present that food to the Fathers without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Rākşasas would certainly tamper with it. ... He lays it down with the text 'whatsoever Asuras roam about being attracted by the _svadhā_ (offering to Fathers), assuming various shapes, be they large-bodied or small-bodied, may Agni expel them from this world (Vāj. S. II, 30)... He then takes the water jar and makes the Fathers wash (their hands) merely saying 'N. N., wash thyself' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N. N. wash thyself (naming the sacrificer's) grandfather; 'N. N., wash thyself(naming) the sacrificer's great-grandfather.

As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case. Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke and cut off near the root; the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men and the root part (of darbhas) to the fathers. Therefore they are cut off near the roots ...... He spreads them along with the line with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents (to the fathers the three round cakes of rice). He presents thus :- for the gods they offer thus: for men they ladle out; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way; therefore he presents (the cakes to the fathers) thus. With 'N. N., this for thee!' he presents one cake to the sacrificer's father. Some add 'for those that come after thee', but let him not say this, since he himself is one of those to whom it would be offered in common. Let him therefore merely say 'N, N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's father; 'N. N., this for thee' as to his grandfather; 'N. N., this for thee' as to his great grandfather...He then mutters 'Here, O fathers, regale yourselves; like bulls come hither each to his own share!' (Vāj. S. II, 31). Whereby he says 'Eat each his own share'. He then turns round to the left so as to face the opposite (north) side ; for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers). 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail' say some; 'for thus far extends the vital energy'. However, having remained so far a moment-he again turns round (to the right) and mutters 'the Fathers have regaled themselves; like bulls they have come each to his own share' (Vāj. S. II, 31); whereby what he says is 'they have eaten each his own share'. Thereupon he takes the water jar and makes them wash themselves (by pouring water on the piṇḍas), merely saying 'N. N., wash thyself' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N. N. wash thy self' (naming) his grandfather; 'N. N., wash thyself' (naming) his paternal great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest). When he has taken his meal, so it is here. He then pulls down the tuck (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuck is sacred to the Fathers; therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck, ... Six times he performs obeisance, for there are six seasons and the fathers are the seasons. He mutters 'Give us houses, O fathers' for the fathers are the rulers of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacrificial performance. After the piṇḍas have been put back (in a dish) the sacrificer smells at (the rice); this (smelling) being the sacrificer's share.

The stalks of darbha cut with one stroke he puts on the fire; and he also throws away the firebrand on to the fire[^960a].

It will be noticed that many of the fundamental conceptions of a pārvaṇa-śrāddha are very clearly brought out in the Sat. Br. Wearing the sacred thread on the right shoulder, afternoon as the proper time, cleansing the paddy only once, boiling the rice on the Dakṣiṇa fire, offering into the same fire two oblations to the gods first, the two formulas of presentation to Agni Kavyavāhana and to Soma Pitṛmat, drawing a line or furrow to the south of the Dakşiņa fire, laying down a firebrand, making the three paternal ancestors wash (_avanejana_)[^961], darbha grass severed from near the root, spreading the darbhas on the line or furrow and offering three piṇḍas to the three ancestors to regale themselves, turning away from the piṇḍas for a moment and then resuming his position and saying that the ancestors have regaled themselves, offering water for washing (pratayavanejana), pulling down the tuck and performing obeisance six times (and identifying the Fathers with seasons) and praying to the Fathers to bestow houses, smelling the boiled rice, throwing the darbhas and firebrand into the fire--these are the principal matters even now in the Pārvaṇa-śrāddha performed by students of the Śukla Yajurveda, although several other details (such as the introduction of the mother's paternal ancestors) and some mantras are added. The Kātyāyana Sr. IV. 1. closely follows the Sat. Br., but adds certain details viz. he folds his hands and repeats the six mantras (Vāj. S. II, 32 'namo vah pitaro rasāya' &c.) throwing three threads on each piṇḍa with the mantra 'etadvaḥ' (Vāj. S. II, 32) or the woollen fringe of a garment or hair from the chest of the sacrificer when he is beyond fifty years of age, sprinkling water on the piṇḍas or on the ground near them with (Vāj. S. II. 34)[^962].

[^961]: On 'wash thyself' the com. on कात्या.श्रौ.सू. IV. 1.10 says 'अपसव्यं यथा स्यात् हस्तस्य सव्यप्रदेशाद्दक्षिणप्रदेशेनोदकनिनयनं यथा स्यात्तथाङ्गुष्ठप्रदेशिन्योरन्तरालेनावनेजयति अवनिक्ताञ् शुचीन करोति पिण्डदानाय । असाविति सम्बुद्धयन्तगोत्रनामादेशपूर्वकं, अमूकगोत्र यजमानस्य पितरमुकशर्मन्नवनेनिक्ष्व'. Some other sūtrakāras provide अमूकगोत्र for अमूकसगोत्र.

[^962]: About the use of the words 'those that come after thee' vide n. 781 for the Tai. S. passage where those words are employed and also notes 1040, 1052, 1053. 'He presents them thus'-When the piṇḍa is to be offered to the Fathers it is done with the _pitṛtirtha_ (the part of the hand between the thumb and forefinger). This is indicated by the teacher by means of a gesture. 'He then pulls down the tuck-' The sacrificer (or adhvaryu) puts on an upper garment when the rite commences, the _daśā' or unwoven edge of which he tucks under the waistband, This he loosens or pulls out at this stage. It will have been noticed that the Sat, Br. in dealing with Piṇḍapitṛyajña employs Vāj. S. II, 29 (except 'apahatā asurā rakṣāmsi vedişadaḥ'), 30, 31.

## Pārvaņaśrāddha in Āśv. gr.

The other _samhitās_ also contain identical mantras. For example, the Vaj. S. II. 29–34[^963] are mantras most of which are employed in the Piṇḍapitṛyajña in Sākamedha[^964]. Similarly, in the Maitrāyani Samhitā[^965] I. 10.3. 10-21 these are mantras for the pitṛyajña employed in Sākamedha many of which are the same as in Vaj.s.or Tai. Br. M.S. I. 10.3.11 is the same as Vāj. S. III 52 and M, S, I. 10. 3. 17-20 are the same as Vāj. S. III.51,53-55. M.S. I. 10.3.13-14 greatly resemble Vaj.S. II. 32 and Tai. Br. I. 3. 10.8.

Coming to the sūtra literature, it is best to begin with the procedure of _pārvaṇaśrāddha_ as described in the Āśv. gr. IV. 7-8 966. It is stated by the Anākula on Ap. gr. 21.1 that the monthly śrāddha (māsi-śrāddha) is the prakr̥ti of Aṣṭakā and other śrāddhas in which three ancestors are to be invoked. It is as follows: Now then at a Pārvaṇa-śrāddha, or at a śrāddha celebrated for securing some desired object, or at an Ābhyudayika-śrāddha or at an Ekoddiṣṭaśrāddha, the performer causes to sit down brāhmaṇas who are endowed with learning, moral character and proper conduct or who are endowed with ( at least) one (of these three characteristics ), who have been invited already in proper time, who have taken a bath, whose feet are washed (by the performer) and who have sipped water (taken _ācamana_), as representatives of (or equal to) the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each of the Fathers, or two for each or three for each. The larger the number of brāhmaṇas invited the greater is the fruit or reward. But in no case (should he invite ) only one for all (the Fathers ); or he may invite only one brāhmaṇa except at the first śrāddha[^967]. By the exposition of the Piṇḍapitṛyajña the rules for the pārvaṇa-śrāddha have been declared. Having given water (into the hands of the invited brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas after they sit down) and double-folded darbha blades as a seat (on which the darbhas are to be kept), having again given water to them and having poured water into three vessels of metal (silver &c.), of stone and of earthenware or into three vessels made of the same substance (out of these three) which are covered over with _darbha_ blades and having recited (over the water in the vessels ) the verse 'śanno &c.' (Ṛg. X. 9.4)[^968] the performer puts sesamum grains into the water with the _mantra_ "Sesamum art thou, Soma is thy deity, at the Gosava[969] sacrifice thou hast been created by the gods, thou hast been offered by persons who are like ancient ones; through the _svadhā_ mayst thou make the Fathers and these worlds pleased with us! svadhā! Adoration!” The different items of the rite are performed from the right to the left[^970]. With the part of the other hand (i.e. left) between the thumb[^971] (and forefinger) since he wears the sacred thread over the left shoulder, or with the right which he seizes with the left, (he offers the Arghya water) to Fathers with the words "Father, this is: the _arghya_ for thee; Grand-father, this is the arghya for thee; Great-grand father, this is the arghya for thee"; after first offering (ordinary) water to the Fathers. When about to induce the brāhmaṇas to accept the arghya water he should once only (for each brāhmaṇa or group of brāhmaṇas for each of the Fathers) say to them 'svadhā! these are arghya waters' and then over the waters that are poured out he recites the verse (separately for each brāhmaṇa) 'The heavenly waters which have been produced on the earth, in the aerial regions and the waters that are terrestrial, that are golden-hued, and fit for sacrifice-may these waters bring us welfare and be favourable to us'. Pouring together (in the first vessel) what has been left in the vessels (for holding _arghya_ water) he anoints his face with that water if he (the performer) desires that a son be born to him. 'He should not remove the first vessel into which the arghya water for the Fathers has been poured (till the end of the rite). The Fathers dwell therein concealed; thus did Śaunaka say'[^972]. Just at that time the gifts of sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, lamp, and clothes are to be offered (to the brāhmaṇas)[^973]. Having taken some food (from the Sthālīpāka prepared for Piṇḍapitṛyajña) and smeared it with ghee he asks the brāhmaṇas' permission in the words 'I shall offer it in the fire' or in the words 'let me offer in the fire'. The permission is given (by the brāhmaṇas) in the words 'Let it be done' or in the words'do it'. He then sacrifices in the fire as stated before [^974] or (if the brāhmaṇas give permission) in the hands of the brāhmaṇas; since the Brāhmana text says 'fire is verily the mouth of the Fathers'. If he offers in the hands of the brāhmaṇas[^975], then he assigns other food to them after they have sipped water and the food (that remains) is mixed with the food that is served to the brāhmaṇas, since it is said 'what is abandoned and given to (brāhmaṇas )[^976] brings prosperity'. When he sees that the brāhmaṇas are satiated (with the food served at the dinner) he (the performer) should recite to the brāhmaṇas the verses containing the word 'madhu' (Ṛg. I. 90.[^977] 6-8) and also the verse 'they have eaten, they have enjoyed themselves' (Ṛg. I. 82.2). Having asked the brāhmaṇas 'was the dinner perfect?' (they should reply that it was) and then having taken (portions of) the different foods that were enjoyed by the brāhmaṇas together with the sthālīpāka food in order[^978] to make lumps (piṇḍas) thereof he should present all (the rest of the food) to the brāhmaṇas. After the brāhmaṇas have either accepted (the rest of the food) or given him permission (to use it for his family and friends), and after they have finished eating he should, before they have sipped water (performed ācamana after finishing their dinner), put down the lumps[^979] (piṇḍas) for the Fathers. According to some teachers (piṇḍas are put down) after the brāhmaṇas have sipped water (on getting up from the dinner). Having strewn the food on the ground (near the remnants of food) and wearing the sacred thread on his left shoulder[^980] he should (after turning the first vessel with top upside and after giving _dakşiņā_ to the brāhmaṇas) bid adieu to the brāhmaṇas saying 'utter Om!Svadha' or he should say 'Om! Svadhā !' (and they should reply Om! Svadhā!)[^980a].

Both the commentators Uvata and Mahidhara, of Vaj.S., hold that rasa, śoṣa and the other four are to be identified with the six seasons from spring (madhu etc.) and some of the digests provide for the worship of ऋतुs in śrāddha in this way. The कात्या.श्रौ.सू.(V.9.24-25) states that with this mantra (Vaj.S. II.32) the performer folds his hands or makes six obeisances. Vide Hemādri (Śr.pp.1459-60) who quotes the Vāj S. (II. 32) and Tai. Br. and explains them.

आपः occurs in तै. बा. II. 7. 15. 4. The ब्राह्मणसर्वस्व reads प्रत्नमद्भिः पृक्तः and प्रीणाहि (folio 78), and explains अद्भिः पृक्तः जलेन मिश्रितः पितृन् लोकान् पितृपितामहादीन् प्रत्नं चिरकालं स्वधया स्वधोच्चारणेन प्रीणाहि प्रीतान् कुरु. This yields a good sense. Different editions of the आश्व. सू number the sutras differently. Here the Nirn. edition of 1894 is relied upon.

[^967]: Vide n. 903 above for the several meanings of 'anādye'.

[^968]: The verse is si at शं नो देवीरभिष्टय आपो भवन्तु पीतये । शंयोरभि स्रवन्तु नः ॥ ऋ. x 9.4. This मन्त्र is recited only once.

[^969]: For the गोसव sacrifice, vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1213 2644. The mantra about sesamum is repeated over each of the three vessels.

[^970]: The rules about Piṇḍapitṛyañja have been set forth in Āsv. Sr. S. II. 6. Nārāyana notes (on Āśv. gr. IV. 7.2) that Āśvalāyana treats of only the procedure relating to the rite for pitṛs and that he does not at all refer to the dinner given to _daiva_ or Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas at the time of śrāddha. It is therefore possible that feeding daiva brāhmaṇas was added to the ancient ritual, though it must be said that Manu III. 125, Yaj. I. 224-28 and Vas. XI. 27 prescribe such feeding. Dr. Caland (in 'Ahnencult' p. 161 ) asserts that he can prove that the detail of feeding _daiva_ brāhmaṇas spread from the Śrāddhasūtra of Katyāyana to the other sutras and he relies on the fact that Kātyāyana (in Kandikā 2) prescribes that the viśve devāḥ should be invoked with the verse 'Visve devāsa āgata' and the performer should mutter the verse 'viśve devāḥ śṛṇutemam' which are respectively Vaj. S. VII. 34 and XXXIII. 53. But Dr. Caland tries to prove too much. The first verse occurs twice in the Ṛg. (II. 41. 13 and VI 52.7) and the second occurs in Ṛg. VI. 52. 13, Tai. S. II. 4. 14. 5. They are not found only in the Vaj. S. as Dr. Caland seems to have thought. It is possible that other works took over those mantras from the Ṛgveda or the Tai. S. It may also be noted that Yāj. I. 229 mentions only 'Viśve devāsa' and specifies that it is a ṛk (and not a mantra or yajus). So Yaj. at least does not appear to have borrowed the prescriptions of Kātyāyana. It is not necessary to examine the other arguments.

[^971]: The part of the hand between the thumb and forefinger is called पतृतीर्थ and water is offered by that part of the hand for the pitṛs; vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 316 note 652. नारायण explains इतरपाण्यङ्गुष्ठा. in two ways as Follows: 'येन पाणिना कर्म करोति दक्षिणेन वा सव्येन वा तस्मिन्नसे यज्ञोपवीते स्थिते प्राचीनावीती भवति ततोऽन्यस्मिन्नंसे स्थिते उपवीती भवति । अत्र तूपवीतित्वात्माचीनावीस्तित्व सिद्धयर्थे सव्यपाणिपितृतीर्थेन दातव्यमित्यर्थः । अथवा सव्यपाणेः शिष्टगहितत्वादक्षिणं पाणिं सव्येन पाणिना गृहीत्वा दक्षिणेनैव पाणिनोपवीत्येवार्घ्ये प्रयच्छेत् ॥. The कल्पतरु. (on श्रा. p.148) explains: प्रसव्येन वामेन हस्तेन । तत्रापि न केवलं वामेनैव अपि तु इतर पाण्युङ्गुष्ठान्तरेण इतरस्य दक्षिणस्य पाणेः अंगुष्ठान्तरेण पितृतीर्थेन । तेनैतदुक्तं भवति । वामहस्तेन अर्घ्ययपात्रं धृत्वा दक्षिणहस्तेन पितृतीर्थे संस्पृश्य यथा ब्राह्मणहस्तेषु जलं पतति तथा देयमिति ।। अर्घ्य is respectful offering of water or water with husked rice grains, flowers, etc. to gods or venerable persons.

[^972]: 'He should not remove etc.' नारायण gives two explanations of
this verse of Saunaka 'तृतीयेन पात्रेण प्रथमपात्रस्यापिधानमिच्छन्ति । अन्ये तु तत्रोत तृतीयार्थे सप्तमी । अर्घ्यपतितं प्रथमं पात्रं न्यग्बिलं कुर्यात् तच्च नोद्धरेदा समाप्तेरिति व्याचख्युः।'' आश्व. गृ. 1V. 8. 14.

[^973]: Gifts of गन्ध etc. -- नारायण notes on आश्व.गृ. IV, 7.10 that from अर्घ्यदान up to (excluding) the gift of the five articles गन्ध etc, the performer is यज्ञोपवीती (i.e wears the sacred thread on the left shoulder and under the right arm). When giving these he becomes प्रचीनावीती(i.e. wears the sacred thread on the right shoulder and under the left arm ).

[^974]: यथोक्तं पुरस्तात्। The reference is to आश्व.श्रौ.सू. II. 6. 12 which reads: प्राचीनावीतीध्ममुपसमाधाय मेक्षणेनादायावदानसम्पदा जुहोति । सोमाय पितृमते स्वधा नमः अग्नेय कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नम इति'. The word अथ in आश्व.गृ. IV. 8.4 indicates tbat all the items of the पिण्डपितृयज्ञ upto होम (i.e, excluding it) are performed before this stage is reached. If the performer has no sacred fire and offers into the hands of the brāhmaṇas the same mantras are employed. The आश्व.श्रौ.सू. II. 6.13 allows an option viz. the word स्वाहा may be used but then the order of मन्त्रs will be अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वाहा, सोमाय पितृमते स्वाहा and he will be यज्ञोपवीती.

[^975]: 'If in the hands.' मनु III. 212 provides that if a man has no Smarta fire, he should offer in the hand of the brāhmaṇa only. सृष्टं is explained by हरदत्त and नारायण as प्रभूतम्.

[^976]: On IV. 8.7. नारायण remarks: अर्थद्वयमत्र विधातुमिष्टमिति गम्यते । तत्राग्नौ कृत्वा भोजनेषु भोजनार्थमन्यदन्नमनुदिशति ददात्येकोर्थः । यदि पाणिहोमः कृतस्तदाचान्तेषु अन्यदन्नं ददातीत्यपरः।

[^977]: Ṛgveda I. 90.6-8 (मधुवाता ऋतायते etc.) are called मधुमती verses because each contains the word मधु several times.

[^978]: On 'स्थालीपाकेन सह' नारायण observes 'स्थालीपाकेन सहेति नात्रापूर्वः
स्थालीपाकश्वोद्यते।...तेन यत्र स्थालीपाको विहितस्तत्र तेन भुक्तशेषेण च पिण्डनिपरणं भवति। यत्र तु स्थालीपाकविधिर्नास्ति तत्र भुक्तोशेषेणैव केवलेन निपरणं भवति।'. In some श्राद्ध such as काम्यश्राद्ध, आभ्युदयिक, अष्टमीश्राद्ध and एकोद्दिष्ट there is no स्थालीपाक.

[^979]: 'He should put down the lumps'. Here आश्वलायन appears to differ from मनु III, 253, 260.

[^980]: The word 'उपवीय' shows that till then the performer was प्राचीनावीती.

[^980a]: It will be noticed that Āsv. omits several details viz. (1) he does not say that the brāhmaṇas for all the gods are to be seated, facing the east; (2) he mentions no mantra such as 'ye agnidadghã &c.;' (3) nothing is said about _dakşinā_ or about the performer following the brāhmaṇas a few paces and then returning with their permission.

From considerations of space it is impossible to set out all the differences among the several gṛhyasūtras of the Ṛgveda, of the Taittiriya śākhā (viz. Baudhāyana, Āp., Hir., Bharadvāja and Vaikhānasa), of the Vājasaneya śākhā (such as Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana), of the Sāmaveda (such as Gobhila and Khādira) and of the Atharvaveda (being Kauśika sūtra). A few matters may be set out by way of illustration. The Āp. gr. (21. 3-4)[^981] states that after the brāhmaṇas are invited for śrāddha dinner) from the food prepared for the dinner a portion is taken out in a vessel and therefrom seven _āhutis_ are cast into the fire with the seven mantras beginning with 'yan me mātā' (in Āp. M. P. II. 19, 1-7), the first two for the father, the next two for the grand-father, next two for the great-grand-father and the 7th to pitṛs in general with svāhā (but without naming any one) and then six oblations of clarified butter are offered with the six formulas beginning with 'svāhā pitṛe' (Ap. M. P. II. 19, 8-13). Thus the agnaukaraṇa in Ap. consists of two parts viz, āhutis of food and of clarified butter, while in Asv. it is made only with food. Then the performer should touch all food (cooked food and the remainder of what is employed for offering into fire ) with the three mantras "eṣa te tata madhumān' (Ap. M. P. II. 19. 14-16), he should make the brāhmaṇas touch the food served to each with the _Yajus_ formula 'the earth is thy vessel' (Ap. M. P. 2. 20. 1) quoted in n. 992 below.

[^981]: The आप. गृ. 20.9 sets down the whole procedure very succinctly after the brāhmaṇas have taken the dinner as follows: भुक्तवतोनुव्रज्य प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य द्वैधं दक्षिणाग्रान् दर्भान संस्तीर्य तेषूत्तरैरपो दत्वोत्तरैर्दक्षिणापवर्गान पिण्डान् दत्त्वा पूर्ववदुत्तरैरपो दत्त्वोत्तरैरुपस्थायोत्तरयोदपात्रेण त्रिः प्रसव्यं परिषिच्य न्युब्ज्य पात्राण्युत्तरं यजुरनवानं त्र्यवरार्घ्यमावर्तयित्वा प्रोक्ष्य पात्राणि द्वन्द्वमभ्युदाहृत्य सर्वतः समवदायोत्तरेण यजुषा शेषस्थ ग्रासाबरार्घ्यं प्राश्नीयात् ।। The mantras referred to here occur in आप. म. पा. II. 19.1 to II. 20. 26.

Āp. gr. prescribes the mantra, 'putrān pautrān' (Ap. M. P. II. 20. 24) for moistening the piṇḍas, while Baud. gr. and Vaikhānasa gr. (IV. 6) employ the mantra "ürjam vahantir' (Vāj. S. II, 34) for the same purpose. It may be noted that
these sūtras which belong to the Taittiriya śākhā employ a Verse from another recension viz. the Śukla Yajurveda.

The Hir. Gr. (II. 10-13) is more elaborate than the Ap. Gr. and not only sets out at length many of the mantras in Āp. M. P. II. 19-20, but adds some more. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana (1-3) sets out the procedure of the monthly śrāddha almost in the same way as the Yājñavalkyasmṛti (which is set out below). It states that in the monthly śrāddha first come the daiva rites and then the various items occur as in the Piṇḍa-pitṛyajña 'piṇḍapitṛyajña-vad-upacāraḥ' (first sūtra of the 2nd kaṇḍikā). Some details which it contains (and Yāj. does not expressly mention) may be set out here. It gives in full the mantras "tilosi', 'yā divya' (both of which occur in Ašv. gr.), 'pṛthivi to pātram' (which is Āp. M. P. II, 20.1). It prescribes that in addition to the Gāyatri and the Madhumati verses the word 'madhu' should be repeated thrice. The holy texts to be repeated while the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating according to Kātyāyana are the Gāyatri (once or thrice), the five Rākşoghni verses (Ṛg. IV. 4.1-5, Vaj. S. XIII. 9-13, Tai. S. T. 2. 14. 1-2). Puruṣasūkta, the Apratiratha hymn (Ṛg.X. 103. 1-13 = Vaj. S. 17. 33-34, 46 = Tai. S. IV. 6. 4. 1-4) and others. It expressly states that the _svadhāvācana_ (Yāj. I. 244) relates to both paternal and maternal ancestors. Besides the blessing contained in Yāj. I. 246, Katyāyana provides that the performer is to pray for and the brāhmaṇas are to pronounce two more viz. 'May the pitṛs be kind (lit. not dreadful) to us' and 'May our family prosper'. Dr. Caland in his learned work 'Altindischer Ahnencult' (pp. 150–152) appears inclined to hold that when a sūtrakāra has not actually said anything on certain items in the śrāddha ritual, one has no right to anticipate, on the authority of later authors, that those items existed in the times of that sūtrakāra. I demur to this conclusion. Dr. Caland has attached no weight to the fact that Jaimini (as stated in H. of Dh, vol. III p. 870) laid down the principle that one may include certain items from another śākhā. Jaimini's sūtras cannot be supposed to have laid down those propositions for the first time. Jaimini's sūtras are at least as old as some of the extant śrauta sütras such as that of Katyāyana. Therefore hardly any chronological conclusions can be drawn with certainty from the silence of a sūtrakāra as to a certain item in the śrāddha ritual.

We shall now turn to the metrical smṛtis. Manu Treats of the procedure of Śrāddha at some length in III. 208–265. But
as the procedure prescribed by the Yājñavalkyasmṛti (I. 226–249) is more compact and at the same time more lucid it is set out here. "When the invited brāhmaṇas come in the afternoon the performer having a _pavitra_[^982] in his hand should seat them on seats and make them sip water. The brāhmaṇas invited should be even in number (2, 4 &c.) according to the performer's resources at the _daiva_ rite (i.e. the Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇas should be two, four &c.) and uneven (three or five &c.) at a (pārvaṇa) śrāddha for the _pitṛs_; the brāhmaṇas should be seated in a pure (cow dunged) plot screened on all sides and sloping towards the south. At the _daiva_ (part of pārvaṇaśrāddha when Viśve-devāḥ are to be invoked) two brāhmaṇas facing the east should sit down and three brāhmaṇas facing the north should be seated in the rite for the pitṛs or only one may be seated for each (i.e, in _daiva_ and in _pitṛya_). The same rule applies to a śrāddha for maternal ancestors. In both (pitṛśrāddha and mātāmahaśrāddha) the worship of Viśvedevas may be performed separately or simultaneously[^983]. Then having poured water on the hands of the brāhmaṇas (meant for the rite in honour of viśve-devāḥ) and having given kuśa blades for a seat[^984] (towards their right side on the seat already occupied), he should, with the permission of the invited brāhmaṇas, invoke the _Viśvedevāḥ_ with the verse 'O! all the gods come!' (Ṛg. II. 41.13 or VI. 52.7; Vāj. S. VII. 34).

[^982]: For the meaning of _pavitra_ see H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 657 notes 1553-54, It is a ring-like loop of _darbhas_ to be worn in the right hand or in both hands on the finger next to the little finger. The Mit, supplies that the invited brāhmaṇas also should have a _pavitra_. The गोभिलस्मृति I, 28 defines it and is quoted by अपरार्क pp. 43 and 480.

[^983]: On Yaj. I. 228 'तन्त्रं वा', the मिता. remarks यदा तु द्वावेव ब्राह्मणौ लब्धौ तदा तु वैश्वदेवे पात्रं प्रकल्प्य उभयत्र एकैकं बाह्मणं नियुञ्ज्यात् । यथाह वसिष्ठः'. Vide p. 403 above for Vas. 11. 30-31 which the मिता. quotes. The विष्णुपुराण III. 15. 16 says: तथा मातामहश्राद्धं वैश्वदेवसमन्वितम् । कुर्वीत भक्तिसम्पन्नं तन्त्रं वा वैश्वदेविकम् ॥. तन्त्र means उभयोद्देशेन सकृदनुष्ठानम् or as शबर on जै. XI. 1.1 explains 'यत् सकृत् कृतं बहूनामुपकरोति तत् तन्त्रं यथा बहूनां ब्राह्मणानां मध्ये कृतः प्रदीपः'. Yaj. I. 228 contains several options about the number of brahmanas. तन्त्रं वा-If the three paternal ancestors and the three maternal ancestors are to be invoked in one sraddha one may separately invite two वैश्वदेवब्राह्मणs for पितृत्रय and two वैश्वदेवब्राह्मण for मातामहत्रय; or only two ब्राह्मणs may do as वैश्वदेविकबाह्मणs for both पितृत्रय and मातामहत्रय. Or even one may do as वैश्वदेवबाह्मण for both.

[^984]: For विष्टर (in या. I. 229), a seat made with 25 darbhas, vide H. of of Dh. vol. II. p. 543 n. 1259. The मिता. says that in addition to the vedic verse, a smārta verse should be recited for invoking the विश्वेदेवाः viz. 'आगच्छन्तु महाभागा विश्वेदेवा महाबलाः। ये यत्र विहिताः श्राद्ध सावधाना भवन्तु ते'॥ This verse is स्कन्दपुराण VII. 1. 217. 32-33 and गरुडपुराण I. 218.7. On p.478 अपराक attributes this स्मार्तमन्त्र to बृहस्पति and to the ब्रह्मपुराण on p. 481. कल्पतरु (on श्रा- pp. 142, 151) also attributes it to both. हेमाद्रि (on श्रा. p. 1226) quotes it from the ब्रह्मपुराण, while the मदः पा. p. 574 quotes it as बृहस्पति's. The मिता notes that this and the following items up to (including) the gift of perfumes and four other things should be done by the performer being यज्ञोपवीती and having his right side towards the brāhmaṇas "एतच्च यज्ञोपवीतिना प्रदक्षिणं च कार्यं अपसव्यं ततः कृत्वा पितृणामप्रदक्षिणम्। इति पित्र्ये विशेषस्मरणात् ।."
अपसव्यं ततः कृत्वा-is या. I. 232 latter half. हेमाद्रि (on श्रा. pp. 1257-58) explains 'प्रदक्षिणादन्यदप्रदक्षिणम् । प्रदक्षिणं नामाभिमुखपुरुषवामाङ्गोपलक्षितं प्रदेशं प्रति कर्मणो निर्वहणं यथा पूर्वाभिमुखोपविष्टदैविकपङ्क्तिमूर्धन्यद्विजादारभ्य तत् पङ्क्तिचरमद्विजापवर्गता'.


Having scattered on the ground (near the brāhmaṇas representing Viśve-devāḥ) barley grains and then having cast into a vessel (of metal &c.) covered with a _pavitra_ water with the verse 'śan no devir' (Ṛg.x.9.4, Vaj.S.36.12, Tai. Ar. IV. 42.4) and barley grains with the mantra 'Yavosi' (Vāj. S. V. 26, Tai. S. I. 3. 1. 1) and (also sandalwood paste and flowers) he should place in the hands (of the brāhmaṇas) the _arghya_[^985] water with the verse 'yā divya' (those heavenly waters &c., Tai. Br. II. 7. 15.4). Then he should pour water into the hand (of the Vaišva-deva brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas) for washing the hand and give to them perfumes, flowers, incense, lamp[^986] and garment. Then wearing the sacred thread on the right shoulder[^987] and under the left arm (i.e, being _prācināviti_) the performer should offer to the pitṛs (i.e. to the three brāhmaṇas representing them) double-folded kuśas (with water) for a seat on the left (i. e, on the seats already occupied kušas should be placed on the left side for a _viṣṭara_), he should then invoke[^988] the pitṛs after taking the permission of the brāhmaṇas with the ṛk. 'uśantas-tvā' (Ṛg. X. 16. 12, Vāj. S. 19.70, Tai. S. II. 6. 12. 1), and should then recite in a low voice the mantra (āyantu naḥ pitaraḥ) 'may the pitṛs come to us' (Vāj. S. 19. 58). The performer, having scattered sesamum seeds all round (the brāhmaṇas) with the mantra 'Apahatā' (Vāj. S. II. 29), should employ sesamum for all purposes where _yavas_ were employed (in the daiva part of the ceremony) and should perform all the items such as giving arghya (water for worship) for the pitṛs as before (for the daiva rite). After offering arghya water, he should collect the drops of the _arghya_ water fallen from the hands (or fingers ) of the brāhmaṇas in one vessel (the pitṛ vessel), them turn it upside down[^989] on the ground (over a bunch of kušas with ends turned towards the south) with the mantra 'thou art a place for the pitṛs.'[^990]. Then, being about to perform "_agnaukaraṇa_' (offering in sacrifice), he takes the food mixed with clarified butter and asks the brāhmaṇas (in the words 'I shall offer into the sacred fire') and when permitted by them with the words 'do so', he offers into the fire (two portions cut off from the food mixed with ghee) with a _mekşaṇa_[^991] according to the procedure laid down for Piṇḍapitṛyajña. He, being intent (only on performing śrāddha correctly), should serve the food that remains after (making the two offerings mentioned above) in plates (except earthen one) that he may be able to secure, and particularly silver oness (plates are meant for feeding pitsya brāhmaṇas). After serving the food in the plates, he should invoke over the plates the mantra 'the earth is thy[^992] support', he should take hold of the thumb of the brāhmaṇas and put it on the food (served in the plates) with the mantra[^993] 'idam Viṣṇur' ('Viṣṇu strode over this' Ṛg. I. 22. 17, Vāj, S. V. 15, Tai S. I. 2. 13. 1). The performer should then mutter the Gāyatri verse (Ṛg. III. 62. 10, Vāj. S. III. 35, Tai. S. I. 5. 6. 4) together with 'Om' and the 'Vyāhṛtis' and the three verses beginning with 'Madhu vātā' (Ṛg. I. 90. 6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27–29, Tai. S. IV. 2.9.3), he should say 'partake (of the food) as you please' and the brāhmaṇas also should eat the food silently. He should serve without anger or bustle food fit for being offered as _havis_ (in a śrāddha) and liked by the brāhmaṇas till they are satiated (so that some food is left in their plates) and should repeat (while the brāhmaņas are engaged in eating) sacred texts and the texts for _Japa_ (Gāyatri &c. already referred to in Yaj. I. 239 above). The sacred texts to be repeated according to the Mit. on Yāj. I. 240 are the Puruṣasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90. 1-16), the Pāvamāni verses (i.e. verses like 'svādiṣṭhayā madişṭhayā' from the 9th maṇḍala of the Ṛgveda as stated by Medhātithi on Manu III, 86 and Haradatta on Gautama (19. 12). Manu III. 232 mentions other works for recitation such as the dharmaśāstras, _ākhyānas_, itihāsa (Mahābhārata), purāṇas and khilas (like Śrīsūkta and Vidyāsūkta).

[^985]: Arghya water '-The मिता. states 'विश्वेदेवा इदं वो अर्घ्य्यमित्यर्घ्योदकं विनिक्षिपेत्'. The arghya is to be offered to each ब्राह्मण separately as required by गोभिलस्मृति III. 74 'अर्घेऽक्षय्योदके चैव पिण्डदानेऽवनेजने । तन्त्रस्य तु निवृत्तिः स्यात्स्वधावाचन एव च' ॥ The printed मिता. reads the मन्त्र as यवोसिधान्यराजोवा. which is not found in the Vaj. S. or other _samhitās_. Similarly, the मिता reads the मन्त्र ‘या दिव्या आपः पयसा' for अर्घ्य, which is probably Ṛg. VII. 49.2 with the order of words changed. अपरार्क (p. 479) states that if there are two वैश्वदेवबाह्मणs then water and yavas should be put in two vessels and the मन्त्र is to be repeated each time when putting water, putting यवs and at each अर्घ्य. हेमाद्रि (on श्रा. p. 1229) defines: 'अर्घ्यो नामार्हणीयान, पुरतः संमाननार्थः प्रशस्तद्रव्यप्रक्षेपः'.

[^986]: 'दीपेच विशेषः शङ्खनोक्तः । घृतेन दीपो दातव्यस्तिलतैलेन वा पुनः । वसामेदोद्भव दीपं प्रयत्नेन विवर्जयेत् '।। मिता. on या. I. 231. The विष्णुधर्मात्तर has the verse घृतेन (I. 141.12).

[^987]: या. I. 232-अपसव्यं ततः. The Mit. quotes वृद्धशातातप that from hence the performer should face the south ''उदङ्मुखस्तु देवानां पितॄणां दक्षिणामुखः ।। प्रदद्यात् पार्वणे सर्व देवपूर्वे विधानतः॥'. 'Double folded kuśas'--compare Āsv.above (p. 434). The स्कन्दपुराण (VII. 1. 206. 17) provides 'दाने स्नाने जपे होमे भोजने देवतार्चने। देवानामृजवो दर्भाः पितृणां द्विगुणास्तथा ॥.' In offering each of the things in daiva or _pitrya_ rite in śraddha water must be given before and after. The मिता. says that here the method called काण्डानुसमय (and not पदार्थानुसमय) has to be followed. These two are dealt with in Jai. V. 2.1-15. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 739-740. In this case if there are three brāhmaṇas, water, kuśas and water are all to be given to one, then the same three to the second and the same three to the third. This is काण्डानुसमय. If water is given one after another to the three, then kušas one after another to them, then water one after another to three, that would be पदार्थानुसमय. काण्ड means पदार्थवर्ग. हेमाद्रि (on श्रा. pp. 759-766) has an exhaustive and lucid discussion on these two. He states that पदार्थानुसमय is the rule but काण्डानुसमय also has to be followed in certain cases. For example, on p. 764 he says 'चरणप्रक्षालनाचमनप्रदानासनोपवेशनानि पदार्थानुसमयेन । आसनक्षणावाहनाघेगन्धपुष्पधूपदीपाच्छादनानां पदार्थानां कृत्स्नं काण्डं वैश्वदेविकेषु द्विजेष्वपवर्ज्यं पैतृकेष्वारम्भणीयम् ' and relies on या. I. 229-234 to show that all items relating to वैश्वदेविकब्राह्मणs are first finished and those relating to पैतृकबाह्मणs are then taken up i.e. there is काण्डानुसमय as to वैश्वदेविक and पैतृकब्राह्मणs. Vide हेमाद्रि (श्रा.) p. 1215 also.

[^988]: आवाह्य (या. I. 233). The मिता. remarks "अथ पितॄन् पितामहान् प्रपितामहामानाहयिष्य इति ब्राह्मणान् पृष्ट्वा आवाहयेति तैरनुज्ञातः उशन्तस्त्वा निधीमहि इत्यनयर्चा पित्रादीनावाह्य 'आयन्तु नः पितरः' इत्यादिना मन्त्रेणोपतिष्ठेत". It may be noted that is all cases where a question is to be put or permission is to be asked the performer addresses the chief among them or all of them as the श्राद्धसूत्र का. says--'सर्वेषु प्रश्नेषु पंक्तिमूर्धन्यं पृच्छति सर्वान्या (2nd कण्डिका of श्राद्धसूत्र).

[^989]: The मिता remarks that on the vessel turned upside down the _pavitras_ covering the three vessels should be placed and unguents, flowers, incense, lamp and garment should be offered to the brāhmaṇas with the words 'पितरयं ते गन्धः etc.

[^990]: पूर्ववत्-The मिता. very briefly sets forth how the items are to be repeated for पैत्र्यब्राह्मण: 'राजतादिषु पात्रेषु त्रिष्वयुग्मकुशनिर्मितकूर्चान्तहितेषु 'शं नो देवीः', इति मन्त्रेणापः क्षिप्त्वा 'तिलोसि सोमदेवत्यः' इत्यादिमन्त्रेण तिलान् गन्धपुष्पाणि च क्षिप्त्वा स्वधार्घ्याः-इति ब्राह्मणानां पुरतोऽर्घ्यपात्राणि स्थापयित्वा या दिव्या इति मन्त्रान्ते पितरिदं ते अर्घ्यं पितामहेदं ते अर्घ्ये प्रपितामहेदं ते अर्ध्यमिति ब्राह्मणानां हस्तेष्वर्घ्ये दद्यात्।. Vide आश्व. गृ. in note 966 above for शं नो देवीः, तिलोसि, या दिव्याः . The मन्त्र is 'अपहता असुरा रक्षांसि वेदिषदः (वाज. सं. II. 29). The बहवृचगृह्यपरिशिष्ट, अपरार्क (p.484) and others say that the name and gotra of the ancestors should be mentioned in offering पाद्य, अर्घ्य, गन्ध etc. Therefore the अर्घ्य॑ will be offered in the form 'अमुकगोत्र पितरमुकशर्मन्नेतत्तेऽर्घ्यम्', हलायुध (folio 18a on श्राद्धसूत्र) notes that in the case of वाजसनेयs the last words are एष तेऽर्घः.

[^991]: मेक्षण is a rod of Asvattha wood one _aratni_ long having at one end a square board four _angulas_ in length (to be used like a mixing spoon ). Two offerings are made with the words अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नमः, सोमाय पितृमते स्वधा नमः (वाज. सं II. 29 where the same formula occurs with स्वाहा for स्वधा नमः). Acc. to Baud, Dh. SII. 8.8-11 the offerings are three viz. to सोमाय पितृपीताय, यमायाङ्गिरस्वते पितृमते, अग्नये कन्यवाहनाय स्विष्टकृते. Acc.to मद.पा. p. 590 this is peculiar to Baudhayaniyas. The ब्रह्मपुराण q. by मद. पा. (p.591) speaks of आहुतित्रय and so does Brahmāṇḍa (upodghata, 11.93-94). If the performer is आहिताग्नि and has observed सर्वाधान method he offeres into दक्षिणाग्नि: if he is not आहिताग्नि or has followed अर्धाधान method he offers into gṛhya or āvasathya fire and if he has neither the śrauta or gṛhya fire he offers into the hand of the brāhmaṇa. For the procedure of पिण्डपितृयज्ञ (which varies from one sakha and sutra to another ) vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1085-1090 and मनु III. 212 for पाणिहोम. The food offered on the hand has to be mixed with the food served in tbe plate and then eaten. When there are several pitṛya brāhmaṇas invited the पाणिहोम is to be made on the hand of the best of the brāhmaṇas acc, to the मद. पा.585 and स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p.462), both of which quote गोभिल II. 120 'पित्र्ये यः पङ्क्तिमूर्धन्यस्तस्य पाणावनग्निमान् । हुत्वा मन्त्रवदन्येषां तूष्णीं पात्रेषु निक्षिपेत् '॥. हलायुध holds that, since या. (1.237 हुतशेषं प्रदद्यात्तु भाजनेषु समाहितः) employs the word भाजनेषु without any qualification, the remnants of the food for होम should be put in all plates including those for दैवब्राह्मणs. The सौरपुराण (19.22 ) says; अग्नेरभावाद्विप्रस्य पाणौ होमो विधीयते। महादेवस्य पुरतो गोष्ठे वा श्रद्धयान्वितः॥

 [^992]: या I. 238. The मन्त्र meant is: पृथिवी ते पात्रं द्यौरपिधानं ब्रह्मणस्त्वा मुखे जुहोमि ब्राह्मणानां त्वा प्राणापानयोर्जुहोम्यक्षितमसि मैषां क्षेष्ठा अमुत्रामुष्मिँल्लोके। आप.म.पा. II. 20.1. The मन्त्र is addressed to the remainder of the food used for अग्नौकरण. पात्र means support. As stated in n. 783, in श्राद्ध the आहवनीय is the ब्राह्मण invited for dinner. About अङ्गुष्ठ, यम q. by कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 183) says: अङ्गुष्ठमात्रो भगवान् विष्णुः पर्यटते महीम् । राक्षसानां वधार्थाय को मेऽद्य प्रहरिष्यति ॥ तस्माच्छ्राद्धेषु सर्वेषु त्वङ्गुष्ठग्रहणं स्मृतम्।.. These are quoted also by अपरार्क p. 494, स्मृतिच. (श्रा.) p. 462 and by हेमाद्रि (श्रा.) p. 1378.

[^993]: यम q. by अपरार्क p. 494 says 'विष्णो हव्यं च कव्यं च ब्रूयाद्रक्षेति च क्रमात्।' The मिता. quotes it as मनु's and says that in the पित्र्य rite the performer being प्राचीनावीतिन् should say 'विष्णो कव्यं रक्ष'.

## Japa in Pārvaṇaśrāddha

There is great divergence of views about the sacred texts to be recited by the performer in a low voice, while the brāhmaṇas are engaged in partaking the food cooked for śrāddha. Vide note 1005 below. It may be that the _japa_ of sacred texts is to be done by the performer wearing the sacred thread in the _upavita_ way as stated by Hemādri p. 1070 and the Madana-pārijāta p. 599, but the Śrāddhatattva (p. 231) is opposed to this and relies on Manu III. 279. Certain verses from the Purāṇas also are to be recited such as the verses from the Varāhapurāṇa (14. 26-31) and Viṣṇupurāṇa (III. 15. 31-36, which are identical with the preceding) quoted by the Kalpataru on śrāddha (p. 197), Aparārka (p. 502) and Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 109), the first and last of which are quoted in the note below[^994]. The Garudapurāṇa (Ācārakhaṇḍa 218.20 ff.) prescribes that while the brāhmaṇas are eating one may recite a eulogy of pitṛs such as the 'saptavyādha' verses[^994a].

[^994]: The first and last verses are: पिता पितामहश्चैव तथैव प्रपितामहः । मम तृप्तिं प्रयान्त्वद्य विमदेहेषु संस्थिताः ॥...यज्ञेश्वरो हव्यसमस्तकव्यभोक्ताव्ययात्मा हरिरीश्वरोऽत्र। तत्संनिधानादपयान्तु सद्यो रक्षांस्यशेषाण्यसुराश्च सर्वे ॥

[^994a]: The सप्तव्याध verses from the हरिवंश (I. 24. 20-21) and गरुडपुराण are: सप्तव्याधा दशार्णेषु मृगाः कालञ्जरे गिरो। चक्रवाकाः शरद्वीपे हंसाः सरसि मानसे ॥ तेभिजाताः कुरुक्षेत्रे ब्रह्मणा वेदपारगाः। प्रस्थिता दूरमध्वानं यूयं किमवसीदथ ॥. On these the श्राद्धतत्त्व (p.231 ) says 'अपहृतगुरुगवीमाँसकृतश्राद्धमहत्त्वप्रकाशकपितृगाथात्वेन सप्तव्याधा इति च पठ्यते'. These very verses occur in the आग्निपुराण chap. 117. -56-57. The story is very clearly set out in हरिवंश 1, Chapters 21-24 and the Matsyapurāṇa chap. 20-21. Seven pupils of Garga guarding their guru's cow thought of eating that cow as they were famished. But the youngest said 'let us make use of the cow's flesh in śrāddha, so that we may be saved from sin'. Two of the brothers became daiva brāhmaṇas, three became pitṛ-brāhmaṇas, one became the giver and the 7th became a guest. They told the guru that the cow was eaten by a tiger. They passed through several births first as seven hunters, then deer in Kalañjara hill and so on. Śrāddha ultimately saved them. The same story is narrated in Padma V. 10.49-125, and v. 47.282-304 (in which last the disciples are said to have been those of वसिष्ठ). After becoming hamsas three of them became kings (a king and two ministers, acc. to मत्स्य) and cared not for the other world. The four others knew the path to moksa, sent word to the three with these verses saying that they four had started on the long road to the other world (प्रस्थिता...ध्वानं) and asking the other three not to be immersed in the mire of wordliness (यूय...दथ). The story also occurs in the शिवपुराण (उमासंहिता chap. 41.24 ff). It is interesting to note that in the Jaina Uttaradhyayana-sūtra (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 56) the echoes of this story of the brothers are heard for illustrating the influence of _karman_.

Then, after holding the food in his hands, the performer should ask the brāhmaṇas 'are you satisfied' (and after they reply that they are satisfied) he should tell them that there is food still left (and ask them what to do with it) and after taking their permission[^995] (in the words 'partake of it along with your friends and relations'), he should spread (in front of the brāhmanas for pitṛs) the remaining food on (_darbhas_ with their ends to the south placed over) the ground (with the mantra 'ye agnidagdhāḥ', those that were cremated and those that were not cremated &c.) and he should pour water once for each into his hand (for rinsing the mouth). Collecting all the cooked food (i.e. portions from each food) with sesamum mixed with it, the performer facing the south should offer the piṇḍas near the remains of the food (eaten by the brāhmaṇas) according to the procedure of the piṇḍapitṛyajña, For maternal ancestors also the same procedure is to be followed (from invoking the Visvedevāḥ to offering piṇḍas). Then he should give water to the brāhmaṇas for sipping. Then (he should say to the brāhmaṇas 'pronounce benediction'); after making the brāhmaṇas say '_svasti_', he should offer water into their hands for saying 'let it be inexhaustible'(after he requests them 'let it be inexhaustible'). Then after giving to the brāhmaṇas dakşiņā (fee or presents)[^996] according to the ability of the performer, he should say to the brāhmaṇas "may I request you to repeat the word 'svadhā'” and when they permit him in the words 'do request us', he should say 'let svadhā be pronounced for the persons concerned' (i.e. the pitṛs and maternal ancestors). Then the brāhmaṇas should say 'let there be svadhā'. On the brāhmaṇas saying so, he should sprinkle water on the ground and say 'let the Visvedevāḥ be pleased' and when the brāhmaṇas have responded with ‘let the Viśve--devāḥ be pleased' he should mutter the following:[^997]
May donors increase in our family, may the (study or teaching of) Vedas prosper and progeny increase in our family); may our faith (in rites for pitṛs) not vanish and may there be plenty of things for us to make gifts'[^998]. Having muttered this, having spoken pleasing words to the brāhmaṇas[^999], having fallen at their feet (after going round them) he being pleased in his heart should dismiss the brāhmaṇas with the mantra 'Vāje vāje' (Ṛg. VII, 38.8, Vāj. S. 21.11, Tai. S. I. 7.8.2), the sending them away being so arranged that the brāhmaṇas representing the pitṛs start first[^1000], (i.e. first goes the representative of the great-grandfather, then the one for the grandfather, then the one for the father and then the one representing the Viśvedevāḥ). The vessel in which the drops of _arghya_ water from the hands of the brāhmaṇas had been collected before should be turned face upwards[^1001] and then the brāhmaṇas should be dismissed. After following the departing brāhmaṇas (up to the boundary) and going round them, he (should return) and should eat the food that remains in the house after) the brāhmaņas representing the pitṛs have partaken of it. He and the brāhmaṇas that partook of the śrāddha dinner should abstain from sexual intercourse on the night of the śrāddha day[^1002].

[^995]: तदन्नं विकिरेद्भूमौ दद्याच्चापः सकृत् सकृत्। या. I. 241. The मिता. comments: तदन्नं पितृस्थानब्राह्मणस्य पुरस्तादुच्छिष्टसन्निधौ दक्षिणाग्रदर्भान्तरितायां भूमौ तिलोदकप्रक्षेपपूर्वकं 'ये अग्निदग्धा' इत्यनया ऋचा निक्षिप्य पुनस्तिलोदकं प्रक्षिपेत् । तदनन्तरं ब्राह्मणहस्तेषु गण्डूषार्थ सकृत्सकृदपो दद्यात् ।. ये अग्निदग्धाः-this is Rg. X. 15.14 translated above (p. 196). Sesamum grains and water were to be cast before as well as after placing the food on the ground. The Mit, speaks of the verse ये अग्निदग्धा as a rk, so it should be taken to be Ṛg. X. 15. 14 ; but later works like the श्राद्धतत्त्व (pp. 231-32) prescribe that the two verses quoted in the beginning of note 1007 below should be recited here. Vide तै.ब्रा. III. 1.1.7 for pitṛs that were अग्निदग्ध and that were not so in another connection.

[^996]: या. I. 244 दत्त्वा तु दक्षिणां शक्त्या -देवल prescribes that दक्षिणा was to be given to the पित्र्यब्राह्मणs first and then to the वैश्वदेविकबाह्मणs 'दक्षिणां पितृविप्रेभ्यो दद्यात्पूर्वे ततो द्वयोः' q. by स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 483). मत्स्य 17. 50-52, वायु 75. 14-15 specify the various gifts. Vide n. 1008,

[^997]: दातारो नो-या. I. 246. This very verse occurs in मनु III. 252, विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 73.28, पद्मपुराण (सृष्टिखण्ड 9.117), मत्स्य 16. 49-50, विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 140.42.

[^998]: The विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 73.50, मत्स्य 16.50-51, पद्म (सृष्टि 9.118) add another verse to या. I. 246 viz. अन्नं च नो बहु भवेदतिथींश्च लभेमहि। याचितारश्च नः सन्तु मा च याचिष्म कंचन ॥.

[^999]: इत्युक्त्वोक्त्वा प्रिया वाचः-या. 1.247, अपरार्क p. 512 quotes from वृहस्पति two verses stating what should be said 'अद्य मे सफलं जन्म भवत्पादाभिवन्दनात् । अद्य मे वंशजाः सर्वे गतास्तेनुग्रहाद् दिवम् ॥ अत्र शाकादिपानेन क्लेशिता ये मयेदृशाः। तत्क्लेशजातं चित्तेन विस्मृत्य क्षन्तुमर्हथ ॥.'

[^1000]: For पितृपूर्व विसर्जनम् (या. I. 247), compare विष्णुपुराण III. 15.48 and विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 140.15 which say 'वैश्वदेवनिविष्टानां चरमं हस्तधावनम्। विसर्जनं च निर्दिष्टं तेषु रक्षा यतःस्थिता॥1. The मिता.adds, following the मत्स्यपुराण 17.59, that before dismissal he should touch the brāhmaṇas with the tip of a darbha 'वाजे वाजे इति जपन् कुशाग्रेण विसर्जयेत्'।.

[^1001]: The Mit, notices that the upturning of the vessel should be done (as the termination त्वा in कृत्वा indicates ) first before the mantra' vāje vāje' (Yai. I. 247) is recited and after the brahmanas recite the benedictory mantras, and then the brāhmaṇas start. Compare Jai. IV.3.37 for क्त्वा denoting पूर्वकालता. संस्रव has two meanings, viz. (1) the drops of water fallen from the hands of the brāhmaṇas when arghya water was offered to them (Mit.) (2) the drops of water that remain in the arghya vessels. श्रीदत्त in his पितृभक्ति (D. C. Ms. 152 of 1892-95) says 'संस्रवपदं ब्राह्मणहस्तमुक्तूजलपरमिति निबन्धारः। कर्कभाष्ये तु अर्धपात्रस्थ शेषीभूतजलं संस्रवपदमित्युक्तम् । युक्तं चैतत् । शेषे प्रतिपत्तेरपेक्षितत्वात्।' folio 25b.

[^1002]: या. I.249. मिता, adds that by reason of the word 'tu' in Ya. I. 249 the performer and the brāhmaṇas have to shun eight actions enumerated in n.924 above.

Many of the Purāṇas contain detailed descriptions of the śrāddha to be performed on every _amāvāsyā_; for example, Matsya 17. 12-60 (closely resembling Yāj. 225-259), Viṣṇupurāņa III. 15. 13-49, Mārkaṇḍeya 28. 37-60, Kūrma (II. 22. 20-62), Padma (sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa) 9. 140-186), Brahmāṇḍa (Upodghātapāda, chap. 12), Skanda VI. 224. 3-51, Viṣṇudharmottara I. 140.6-44. The Agnipurāņa chap. 163 verses 2-42 are the same (with very slight variations and the omission of 2 1/2 verses) as Yāj. I. 227-270; while Agni chap. 117 contains many verses that closely follow the Āśv. Gr. and Yāj. Similarly the Garudapurāṇa contains numerous verses that are identical with Yājñavalkya's. For example, compare Yāj. I. 229-239 with Garuda I. 99. 11-19. The Purāṇas closely follow the Gṛhya sütras, Manu and Yājñavalkya and often employ the same mantras and formulas, though here and there they introduce some details. As remarked by the Varāhapurāṇa 14.51, the procedure for śrāddha is the same in all Purāṇas (iyam sarvapurāṇeṣu sāmányā paitriki kriyā). For sample, a summary of the procedure in the Padma (sṛṣṭi 9. 140-186) is set out here, The performer having honoured the Viśve-devāḥ (i.e. the brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas invited to represent them) with a seat and with yava grains and flowers should fill two vessels with water and should place them on a _pavitra_ of _darbhas_. The water should be offered with the verse 'śam no devir' (Ṛg. X. 9.4) and the yava grains with 'Yavosi'. They should be invoked with the verse 'Viśve devāsaḥ' (Ṛg. II, 41.13) and yavas should be scattered about with the two verses 'Viśve devāsaḥ' (Ṛg. II. 41. 13-14) and he should scatter about _yava_ grains with the verse 'thou art yava, the king of grains &c.' ( quoted[^1003] below).

[^1003]: यवोऽसि धान्यराजस्तु वारुणो मधुमिश्रितः। निर्णोदः सर्वपापानां पवित्रमृषिसंस्तुतम्॥ पद्म (सृष्टि) 9.144. बौ. ध. सू. III. 6.5 is almost identical. The मिता. on या. I. 231 refers to the मन्त्र 'यवोसि धान्यराजो वा' which appears to be the same. अपरार्क p. 479 speaks of 'यवोसि' as a _yajus_.

After decking the brāhmaṇas with sandalwood paste and flowers he should honour them with water with the verse[^1004] 'yā divyā' (vide n. 985). After taking leave of the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas that have been honoured with _arghya_ he should begin the pitṛyajña. He should prepare seats with darbhas on them, worship three vessels, place _pavitras_ on them and pour water in them with 'śam no devir' (Ṛg. X. 9.4), should cast sesamum grains in them with 'tilosi' and then put in them sandalwood and flowers. (Then verses 147-152 speak about the vessels to be employed). He then should announce the names and gotra of his ancestors and give darbhas in the hands of the brāhmaṇas. He should then request brāhmaṇas with the words 'I shall invite the pitṛs' and when they reply 'let it be so' he should invoke the pitṛs with the two verses 'uśantas tvā' (Ṛg. X. 16.12) and 'ā yantu' (Vaj. S. 19.58). Then, having offered _arghya_ to the brāhmaṇas (representing the pitṛs) with 'yā divyā' (vide n. 985), having given them sandalwood paste and the other things including garment as the last, he should collect the remainder of the water (in the _arghya_ vessels) into the vessel meant for the father and should keep aside the latter to the north with its top turned downwards with the words 'thou art a seat of the pitṛs'. Then he should begin to serve various kinds of food after bringing the utensils in which the food was cooked and holding them with both hands. (Verses 157-165 speak of the various foods to be offered and the periods of gratification caused thereby to the pitṛs). While the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating he should recite the Vedic hymns[^1005] referring to the Fathers, all the Purāņas, various eulogies of Brahmā, Viṣṇu, the Sun, Rudra and the Vedic hymns addressed to Indra, Rudra and Soma and the Pāvamāni verses, the Sāmans called Bṛhat, Rathantara and Jyeṣṭha Sāman, the chapter on Śānti rites (propitiatory rites for removing evil events or prognostications), the Madhubrāhmaṇa, the Mandala Brāhmaṇa and whatever else gives pleasure to the brāhmaṇas and the performer; and the Mahābhārata also should be recited, as it is very dear to the pitṛs.

[^1004]: मिता. on या. I. 231 refers to the मन्त्र 'या दिव्या आपः पयसा'. The mantra in आश्व. गृ. IV.7.13 'या दिव्या आपः पृथिवी' has been translated above, as also the mantra 'tilosi' from Ašv. gr. IV. 7.8. How the offering of _tila_ water in the midst of mango trees serves two purposes is finely stated in the following verse : एको मुनिस्ताम्रकराग्रहस्तो ह्यामेषु मध्ये सलिलं ददाति। आम्राश्च सिक्ताः पितरश्च तृप्ता एका क्रिया द्वयर्थकरी प्रसिद्धा॥ पद्म (सष्टिखण्ड 11.770 वायु 111. 37, अग्नि 115. 40; compare महाभाष्य 'आम्राश्च सिक्ताः पितरश्च प्रीणिताः।। vol. I. p. 14.

[^1005]: The verses of the पझ (सृष्टि 9.165-169) about what is to be recited are quoted by अपरार्क p. 502, the first verse स्वाध्यायं etc. being मनु III. 232 Compare नारदपुराण (पूर्वार्ध 28.65-68) which among others mentions राक्षोघ्न वैष्णव and पैतृक (RgX. 15.1-13) मन्त्र, पुरुषसूक्त, त्रिमधु, त्रिसुपर्ण. The Santika chapter, acc. to हेमाद्रि (श्रा.) p. 1075, is वाज. सं. 36.10 ff. which begins शं नो वातः पवताम्. The मधुब्राह्मण is what is called मधुविद्या contained in the बृह. उ. II. 5 (beginning with इयं पृथिवी सर्वेषां भूतानां मधु) and छान्दोग्य III. 1 (beginning with असौ
वा आदित्यो देवमधु). The मण्डलब्राह्मण is an उपनिषद् (vide Indische studien III. p. 325). हेमाद्रि (on श्रा.) p. 1075 says 'यदेतन्मण्डलं तपतीत्यादि मण्डलब्राह्मणम्'. These verses of the पद्मपुराण about what it is to be repeated occur in मत्स्यपुराण also ( 17.37-39). The राक्षोघ्नमन्त्रs are five verses (Ṛg. IV, 4.1-5=Vāj. S. XIII. 9-13=Tai S. V. I. 2.14). हेमाद्रि (श्रा. pp. 1069–1073) first sets out the texts mentioned by मनु, विष्णुधर्मसूत्र and the पुराणs, then gives the vedic texts to be repeated by the respective followers of the four Vedas (pp. 1073-1074), then deals with the Saptārcis mantra (vide note 1020). Ultimately Hemādri and Śr, P. say that if a man does not know much he should engage in गायत्रीजप.

After the brāhmaṇas have finished their dinner the performer should collect together in a lump portions from all kinds of food, put water over them and spread[^1006] it (on the ground over darbhas) in front of the plates of the dining brāhmaṇas and should say[^1007] ‘May those persons in our family that were cremated or not cremated be gratified by the food offered on the ground and being gratified may they attain the highest world (or bliss)! May this food offered on the ground for the gratification of those that have neither father nor mother nor relative nor any other friend and have no food (offered by any one else in śrāddha) proceed for union with them wherever it may have to go'! The remainder of the food cooked for śrāddha and food spread on the ground are the lot (or share) of those that died without the saṁskāras (_caula_, _upanayana_ and the like) being performed on them, that abandoned their _gurus_ and of (unmarried) women of the family. Finding that the brāhmaṇas are satisfied (by the dinner) he should give water once in the hand of each brāhmaṇa, should place on the ground smeared with cow's dung and urine darbhas with their ends turned to the south and place on them piṇḍas made from all kinds of foods (cooked for the śrāddha dinner) following the method employed in _Piṇḍapitṛyajña_ after washing them with water. He should then utter the names and gotra (of the ancestors to whom the piṇḍas are to be offered) and should offer flowers and the rest and should again wash them (piṇḍas). He should perambulate the piṇḍas thrice holding darbhas in his hand and he should light lamps and offer flowers for the piṇḍas. When the brāhmaņas sip water after eating the dinner, he should himself sip water and give water once to each of the brāhmaṇas and flowers and _akşatas_ and then _akşayyodaka_ with sesamum grains. He should then make according to his means presents to the brāhmaṇas) of cows[^1008], land, gold, clothes, splendid beds and whatever else was liked by the brāhmaṇas or by the performer himself or his father. He should not be stingy in his presents. Then he should request the brāhmaṇas to say 'svadhā' and they should do so. Then he should request the brāhmaṇas to pronounce the following benedictions and should receive them from them while he faces the east. They are ‘May the pitṛs be kind (not dreadful) to us'; the brāhmaṇas should say 'let it be so'; 'May our family increase!'; they should say 'so be it'; 'May donors in my family prosper and also (the study of) the Vedas and progeny and may these benedictions come out true!'; they should respond let it be so'. He should then remove the piṇḍas and request the brāhmaṇas to utter the word 'svasti' and they should do so. The remains of the food eaten by the brāhmaṇas remain (unremoved or unwiped) till the brāhmaṇas are dismissed; then he should perform the (usual) daily rites _Vaišvadeva, balihoma_[^1009] &c. The remnants of food that lie on the ground are the share of the group of slaves that were straight-forward and not roguish (dishonest or shirkers ). The performer holding a vessel full of water and muttering the verse 'vāje vāje' (Ṛg. VII. 38. 8, Vāj. S. IX. 18, Tai. S. I. 7. 8. 2) should touch the brāhmaṇas with the tip of kušas and dismiss them. He should follow them out of his house for eight paces, should circumambulate them, should then return with his relatives, sons and wife, should then perform the daily _Vaišvadeva_ and _balihoma_. Then after Vaišvadeva he should together with his relatives, sons, guests and servants partake of the food that remains in the cooking pots after what was eaten by the brāhmaṇas.

[^1006]: The verse सार्ववर्णिकमन्नाद्यं...विकिरन्भुवि in पद्म (सृष्टि 9. 170) is the same as Manu III. 244, मत्स्य 17.41 and विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 81.21.

[^1007]: अग्निदग्धाश्च ये जीवा येप्यदग्धाः कुले मम। भूमौ दत्तेन तृप्यन्तु तृप्ता यान्तु परां गतिम्॥ येषां न माता न पिता न बन्धुर्न चान्यमित्रं न तथान्नमस्ति । तत्तृप्तयेऽन्नं भुवि दत्तमेतत्प्रयान्तु योगाय यतो यतस्तत्॥ असंस्कृतप्रमीतानां त्यागिनां कुलयोषिताम्। उच्छिष्टभागधेयानां दर्भेषु विकिरासनम् ॥ पद्म. (सृष्टि 9. 171-173). These verses occur in मत्स्य -17.42-44 which presents some various and better readings (viz. प्रयान्तु
लोकेषु सुखाय तद्वत् and त्यक्तानां कुल योषिताम् ); बो. गृ. सू II. 10.42 (येऽग्निदग्धा जाता जीवा ये ये त्वदग्धाः ...गतिम्॥) is almost the same as the first verse. The verse असंस्कृत० is मनु III. 245, विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 81.22, and Skandapurana VI. 218. 10-11. कात्यायन as quoted by अपरार्क p. 505 reads 'ये आग्निदग्धा ये अनग्निदग्धा जीवा जाता कुले मम। भूमौ...गतिम्॥. Halayudha in his com. on Katyayana's Sraddhasutra holds that अदग्धाः is the proper reading and अनग्निदग्धाः is a bad reading and relies on a verse of the Brahmapurana (folio 26b). त्यागिनां कलयोषितां in मनु III. 245 and elsewhere is explained in different ways. The words may mean 'of persons who abandoned wives descended from good families' or 'of women who forsook their families' or 'of those who committed suicide and of childless women.' One can appreciate the kindly and noble sentiments underlying the above verses. In honouring the pindas, Manu III. 217 (winish speaks of salutation to the six seasons) is deemed to provide for salutations of the six seasons as identified with six ancestors mentioned in the words रसशोषजीवस्वधाघोरमन्यु named in वाज. सं. II. 32 'नमो वः पितरो रसाय...पितरो मत्यवेः' Vide श्राद्धतत्त्व pp. 241-242.

[^1008]: पद्म ( सृष्टि 9. 180) is: गोभूहिरण्यवासांसि भव्यानि शयनानि च। दद्याद्यादिष्टं विप्राणामात्मनः पितुरेव च॥. There is epigraphic and other recorded evidence for gifts of land in śrāddhas. An inscription of Karṇadeva, son of Gāṅgeyadeva of the Cedi year 793 (1042 A.D.) records the grant of a village (called Susi) to a brāhmaṇa on the occasion of the Sāmvatsarika śrāddha of Gāṅgeyadeva at Prayāga. Vide I. A. vol. 16 pp. 204-207 for the grant of a village by the Chandella king Devavarmadeva in _samvat_ 1107 (1050-51 A.D.) on the anniversary of his mother's death and a grant in 1790 A. D. by Fattesing Bhosle, prince of Akkalkot, to a learned brāhmaṇa of thirty _bighas_ of land on the 10th day of his father's death (Bhārata-itihāsa-samśodhana-maṇḍala vol. 29, parts 1 and 2, 1948 p. 41). In the Āśramavāsikaparva 14.35 युधिष्ठिर is said to have made gifts of gold and jewels, slaves, blankets, villages and fields, elephants and horses with their trappings and of girls to ब्राह्मणs श्राद्धs for भीष्म, द्रोण, दुर्योधन and others.

[^1009]:पद्म, सृष्टिखण्ड 9. 185-186 are the same as मनु III, 265,246 and Matsya 17.56-57.

It should be noticed how closely the Padmapurāṇa follows the procedure (including the mantras ) contained in Yājñavalkya. What procedure the author of a Purāņa follows depends upon his learning and the sūtra that he studied. For example, the Viṣṇudharmottara 1.140 appears to rely on the Ap.gr. and the Ap. M. P. (II. 19-20), since I. 140, 12 refers to Āp. M. P. II, 19.1., 1. 140.29-30 to Ap. M. P. II. 19. 14-16, I. 140. 35 to Āp. M. P. II, 20.1. Similarly, Skanda (VI. 224. 3-51) closely follows Āśv. gr and Yāj.

Owing to the difference in details of śrāddha in the several gṛhyasūtras, the smṛtis and the purāņas, an important question arises whether a person should perform a śrāddha rite only in accordance with the gṛhyasūtra of his own Veda or Śākhā or whether he may perform it after the inclusion (_upasaṁhāra_ ) of the several items found in other sütras and smṛtis though not included in the kalpa or gṛhyasūtra of his own Śākhā. This topic is discussed at great length by Hemādri (on śrāddha ) pp. 748-759 and briefly by Medhātithi on Manu II, 29 and XI.216, by the Mit, on Yāj. III. 325, Aparārka p. 1053 and others. Those who are for strictly following the details in one's own sūtra alone argue as follows: If one were at liberty to include details other than those contained in one's own sūtra, the order of the details (_krama_) given in one's sutra and the time specified for each detail would be interfered with. Besides, if the addition of details were permissible, one would be liable to the charge of giving up the usages of one's own family handed down for generations. These objectors rely upon such passages as that of the Viṣṇudharmottara which states 'He who violating (the dictates of ) his own sūtra acts according to a sutra meant for others, treats thereby his own sage ( the author of his sūtra ) as unauthoritative and incurs (the blame of) doing what is improper.'[^1010] The smṛtis that contain additional details may be meant for those men who have no _kalpa_ or _gṛhyasütra_ of their own or they may be useful for Śūdras.

Those who espouse the view that as far as possible all details found in several gṛhyasūtras and smṛtis on one rite should be included by every one rely mainly on Jaimini II. 4. 8-33 which is called 'śākhāntarādhikaraṇanyāya' or 'sarvaśākhāpratyayanyāya'. The principal sutra is Jai. II. 4. 9.[^1011] It is established in this sūtra that the _prayojana_ (purpose ) or _phala_ (reward to be secured) of the rite is the same in different sūtras and smṛtis. For example, the rewards of śrāddha are stated to be the same in all sūtras and smr̥tis (vide notes 787-790 above); then the _dravya_ (materials) and the deity are the same (in _Pārvaṇaśrāddha_ the deities are the paternal ancestors and the materials, viz. _kuśas_, _tilas_, water, vessels, foods &c. are the same in all works).

[^1010]: यः स्वसूत्रमतिक्रम्य परसूत्रेण वर्तते । अप्रमाणसृ्षिं कृत्वा सोप्यधर्मेण युज्यते ॥ विष्णुधर्मात्तर  II, 127, 148-149.

[^1011]: एकं वा संयोग-रूप-चोदनाख्याविशेषात् । जै. II. 4.9 (separate as चोदना +आख्या+अविशेषात् ); on this शबर explains 'तदेव प्रयोजनमुद्दिश्य तदेव विधीयमाने प्रत्यभिजानीमः। रूपमप्यस्य तदेव द्रव्यदेवतम्। पुरुषप्रयत्नस्तादृश एव चोद्यते। नामधेयं चाविशिष्टम् । तेन तदेव कर्म सर्वशाखास्विति प्रत्ययः।' The तन्त्रवार्तिक explains 'संयोग इति प्राधान्यात् फलसंयोगग्रहणम् ।...चोदनेति सर्वधात्वर्थभावनाविषयो विधिः।' Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, p. 870 for a brief explanation of this सर्वशाखाप्रत्ययन्याय. मेधा. on मनु XI. 216 puts the maxim very briefly as 'आप्यायस्व सं ते पयांसि-इति स्मृत्यन्तरोक्तो विधिरपेक्षितव्यः । एकशास्त्रत्वात्सर्वस्मृतीनामसति विरोधे समग्रं योज्यं विरोधै तु विकल्पः।'

 The effort that is enjoined (the _vidhi_) is the same and the name (_Pārvaṇaśrāddha_, Ekoddiṣṭa śrāddha &c.) is the same. Therefore, on account of these various signs one easily recognizes that the same rite is being dealt with by all sūtras, even if many of them differ in details. It cannot be said that smṛtis will be useful for those who have no sutras of their own. Each man of the first three varņas is attached to some sūtra or other by the tradition of his family or caste. Similarly, the smṛtis cannot be held to be meant for śūdras alone, since the smṛtis mainly deal with _upanayana_, the study of the Vedas, _agnihotra_ and other matters with which a śūdra has no concern. Similarly, the objection that if details were allowed to be inserted from other sūtras and smṛtis the _krama_ and _kāla_ prescribed in one's Sūtra might have to be set aside, the reply is contained in Jai. I. 3. 5-7 (explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 841-848 )[^1012]. The _śruti_ says 'after getting ready a bundle of kuśa grass he prepares the _vedi_ (altar)'. Here a certain order of acts is laid down. If after a bundle of kušas is got ready, the man has a sneeze, he has to sip water (perform _ācamana_) immediately as laid down by Manu V. 145 and Vas. III. 38 before he prepares the vedi. So the objector says the _krama_ will be interfered with. The reply is that the sequence (_krama_) is only a characteristic of the items in the śruti passage, that all that is meant is that the making of the altar follows the getting ready of a kuśa bundle, but that it is not meant that the making of the vedi should follow immediately after the bundle is got ready. Therefore, the conclusion is that whatever detail is not in conflict with one's own śākhā or sutra may be included in the rite one is about to perform, but if there is a direct conflict, then one should stick to one's own sūtra. As observed by Kātyāyana 'whatever is declared, whether in great detail or in brief, in one's own gṛhyasūtra about a rite, if he performs that much, it may be taken that he has done all that is required of him; but what is not handed down in one's śākhā (or sūtra) but is contained in another śākhā and is not in conflict with one's own śākhā, should be performed by the learned, as in the case of agnihotra and the like'[^1013].

[^1012]: अपि वा कारणाग्रहणे प्रयुक्तानि प्रतीयेरन् । जै. I. 3. 7. On this शबर observes: आचान्तेन कर्तव्यं यज्ञोपवीतिना कर्तव्यं ... इत्येवंलक्षणान्युदाहरणानि। किमेतानि श्रुतिविरुद्धानि न कर्तव्यानि उताविरुद्धानि कार्याणि चेत्पश्यसि तैरप्यनुष्ठीयमानैर्वैदिकं किंचिन्न कुप्यति तस्मादविरुद्धानीति। नैतदेवम्। शास्त्रपरिच्छिन्नं हि क्रमं बाधेरन् । कथम् । वेदं कृत्वा वेदिं कुर्वीतेतीमां श्रुतिमुपरुन्ध्यादन्तरा वेदं वेदिं चानुष्ठीयमानमाचमनादि'. This pürvapaksa is refuted later on.

This verse is गोभिलस्मृति I.35 (reads परोक्तमविरोधि and • होत्रादिकर्मवत् ). अपरार्क p. 8 and स्मृतिच. I. p. 5 quote this verse as कात्यायन's and also another of his 'बह्वल्पं वा स्वगृह्योक्तं यस्य कर्म प्रकीर्तितम् । तस्य तावति शास्त्रार्थ कृते सर्वः कृतो भवेत् ॥'. हेमाद्रि (on श्रा.) p. 756 quotes this last verse as वैजपायन's. Both verses (बह्वल्पं0 and यन्नाम्नातं) are quoted as from the परिशिष्ट by हलायुध in his com. on the श्राद्धसूत्र of कात्यायन (folio 30 a). The स्मृतिच. (I p. 5) adds another half verse of कात्यायन viz.आत्मतन्त्रे तु यन्नोक्तं तत्कृर्यात्पारतन्त्रिकम्'।. In आत्मतन्त्र, तन्त्र means सिद्धान्त (i.e. one's सूत्र). आग्निहोत्रादिकं यथा-This is explained by श्राद्धसौख्य (टोडरानन्द folio 64a) as follows: 'यथा छन्दोगानामनुक्तोपि यजुर्वेदविहितोग्निहोत्रविधिः क्रियते '.  

The first verse of Katyayana may be explained as applying where one's śākhā or sūtra deals with a matter without requiring any addition or as the next best course where one is not able to supplement one's sūtra owing to some unseen cause or owing to human difficulties. The Saṅgraha says that where different items of the śrāddha rite are declared to be performed at different times and there is no agreement among the sages, one should follow one's gṛhyasutra, but where one's gṛhyasūtra is silent as to a certain item or as to the stage when it is to be performed, there is an option and one may follow the opinion of some gage as to that item[^1014]. It appears that even the ancient gṛhya sūtras exhibit tendencies that led to the sarvaśākhā-pratyaya-nyāya e.g. Ašv. gr. (q. in n. 966) employs several passages (such as 'Tilosi', 'Yādivyā,' which do not occur in the Ṛgveda.)

It is owing to this maxim of 'sarvaśākhā-pratyayanyāya' that medieval digests go on heaping up details from all smṛtis and purāṇas in their descriptions of the several šrāddhas, the procedures of which were not originally very extensive.

The Kūrmapurāṇa[^1015] provides that the performer should before noontime is past bring to his house the invited brāhmaṇas who have shaved themselves and pared their nails, should offer them materials for brushing the teeth and request them to sit down on separate seats, then give them oil and water for bathing. It will be seen that here the purāṇa has added several details that were not provided for by the Āśv. gr̥. (n. 966), Manu (III. 208 ), Yāj. (I. 226) and even by some of the purāņas such as the Varāha 14, 8, which begin the procedure with seating the brāhmaṇas in the afternoon on seats after welcoming them. Many more examples could be given, but that attempt is not made owing to considerations of space.

[^1014]: यान्यत्र कालभेदेन कर्माणि मुनयो जगुः । स्वगृह्योक्तानुसारेण विकल्पस्तेषु युज्यते॥ न गृह्यादिस्मृतिर्येषां श्राद्धादावुपलभ्यते । कर्तुमर्हन्ति ते कृत्स्नं यस्य कस्य मुनेर्मतम् ।। संग्रह q. by हेमादि (श्रा. p. 1484). The श्रा. कि. को. p. 125 briefly puts the position as follows 'आकांक्षितं परशाखोक्तमपि कर्तव्यमनाकांक्षितं तु न कर्तव्यमेव । पुराणोक्तं तु आकांक्षितमनाकांक्षितं वा सामान्यधर्मत्वात्सर्वैरेवानुष्ठेयम् । तत्रापि स्वशाखोक्ता विरोधिना कार्यमिति'।. The following verse quoted from Gobhila by the com. on San. Sr. S. IV. 4. 10-15 takes a very strict view 'ऊनो वाप्यधिको वापि यः स्वशाखोस्थितो विधिः । तेन सन्तनुयाद्यज्ञं न कुर्यात्पारतन्त्रिकम् ॥'.

[^1015]: ततो निवृत्ते मध्याह्ने लुप्तरोमनखान् द्विजान् । अवगम्य (अभिगम्य?) यथामार्गे प्रयच्छेद्दन्तधावनम् । आसध्वमिति सञ्जल्पन्नासीरंस्ते पृथक् पृथक् । तैलमम्यञ्जनं स्नानं स्नानीयं च पृथग्विधम् । कूर्म (उत्तरार्ध 22.20-21). In B, I edition the order of verses is different. The first is quoted by हेमाद्रि (on श्रा.) p. 1167 from देवल and कूर्म and by कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 117) from देवल.

Before proceeding to give some idea as to how the pārvaṇaśrāddha was dealt with in medieval and modern times, observations must be made on several relevant matters, on which there is a difference of views or which are important in a general way.

When the invited brāhmaṇas come afternoon, it is provided in some of the purāņas that two _maṇḍalas_ should be made in front of the performer's residence for receiving the brāhmaņas. For example, the Nāradapurāņa states[^1016] the maṇḍala for a brāhmaṇa performer should be square (four cornered) in size, for a kşatriya triangular, circular for a vaišyà and for a śūdra mere sprinkling of the ground with water is enough.' The _maṇḍalas_ should be made on ground smeared with cowdung and with water mixed with cow's urine. Of the two maṇḍalas one should be on the northern side sloping towards the north and the other on the southern side sloping towards the south. On the northern maṇḍala kuśas with points towards the east should be placed along with akşata (unbroken or whole) grains and on southern one double-folded kuśas should be placed along with sesamum grains. The northern maṇḍala should generally be two cubits on each side while the southern one should be four cubits on each side. The brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas that represent the _Viśvedevāh_ should be honoured in the northern maṇḍala first by the performer himself with water for washing their feet after bending his right knee and the brāhmaṇas representing the pitṛs should be then honoured in the southern maṇḍala with water for washing the feet (hence called _pādya_) after bending his left knee.

[^1016]: श्राद्धार्थे समनुज्ञातः कारयेन्मण्डलद्वयम् । चतुरस्रं ब्राह्मणस्य त्रिकोणं क्षत्रियस्य च । वैश्यस्य वर्तुलं ज्ञेयं शूद्रस्याभ्युक्षणं भवेत् ॥ नारदपुराण (पूर्वार्ध 28 32-33) सौरपुरण ( 19. 13-14) has almost the same verse as चतुरस्रं etc. Vide अपरार्क 475 for मण्डलs


## Making of maṇḍalas

457

The mantra at the time of offering _pādya_ is “śanno devir' Ṛg. X. 9. 4)[^1017]. After the mantra is recited he should give the water to the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas and to the pitṛya brāhmaṇas as noted below (in n,1017). After the pādya water is offered the brāhmaṇas should come in front of the maṇḍalas and sip water ( take _ācamana_).

The ancient sūtras and smr̥tis like those of Manu and Yāj. (T. 229) say generally that the Viśvedevāḥ are to be invoked, but some of the later smṛtis (such as Prajapati, verses 179-190) and purāṇas contain verses enumerating ten names of Viśve devās and assign two each (out of the ten) to five classes of śrāddhas. They say[^1018]: "in śrāddha performed in an _işti_ the _Viśvedevas_ are Kratu and Dakṣa, in a Nándimukha śrāddha they are Vasu and Satya, in Kāmyaśraddha Dhuri and Locana, in naimittika śrāddha Kāla and Kāma and in Pārvaṇa-śrāddha Purūravas and Ārdrava'. According to the Sm. C. and Hemādri a seat (_āsana_) is to be given to the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas and invocations are to be made in the several śrāddhas after taking the names enumerated above.

[^1017]: शं नो देवीरिति मन्त्रं पठित्वा पुरूरवार्द्रवसंज्ञका विश्वेदेवा इदं वः पाद्यमिति दद्यात् । एवं पित्रर्थै बाह्मणपादयोरपि शन्नो देवीति मन्त्रान्ते पितरमुकगोत्रामुकशर्मन् वसुरूप इवं ते पाद्यमिति दद्यात् । मद. पा. p. 567.

[^1018]: ऋतुर्दक्षो वसुः सत्यः कालः कामस्तथैव च । धुरिश्वारोचनश्चैव तथा चैव पुरूरवाः । आर्द्रवश्च दशैते तु विश्वे देवाः प्रकीर्तिताः। बृहस्पति q. by अपरार्क p. 478, कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 142), स्मृतिच (. pp. 442-443); the words विश्वे देवाः are to be kept separate and not compounded. 'इष्टिश्राद्धे ऋतुर्दक्षः सत्यो नान्दीमुखे वसुः । नैमित्तिके कालकामौ काम्ये च धुरिलोचनौ॥ पुरूरवा आर्द्रवश्च पार्वणे समुदाहृतौ। बृह.q. by अपरार्क p. 478, श्रा. प्र. p. 23, मद. पा. (p. 573-574) which explains 'इष्टिश्राद्धमाधानादौ क्रियमाणं...। नैमित्तिके सपिण्डीकरणे। कामनयानुष्ठेयगयामहालयादि श्राद्धं काम्यम् । इष्टिश्राद्ध is the कर्माङ्गश्राद्ध, 9th among the 12 श्राद्धs quoted above from विश्वामित्र (in n. 858). The श्रा. प्र. p. 23 notes the different readings of some of the names such as पुरूरवस् and आर्द्रव, some saying the first is पुरूरव and the second is माद्रव. The printed श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 199 has माद्रव and so has टोडरानन्द (श्राद्धसौख्य folio 57 a). श्राद्धतत्त्व explains इष्टिश्राद्ध as इच्छाश्राद्ध and नैमित्तिक as एकोद्दिष्ट. The श्रा. क्रि. कौ. (p.56) reads पुरोरवाः and माद्रवाः. कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 142) reads मार्द्रवश्च दशैते तु. The ब्रह्माण्डपुराण (III. 3.30-31) enumerates the ten विश्वेदेवाः somewhat differently. It reads'पुरूरवो माद्रवसो रोचमानश्च'. The ब्रह्माण्ड (III. 12.3ff.) states that ten sons were born to विश्वा, one of the daughters of दक्ष्ऽ. When they performed severe tapas on a Himalaya peak Brahma gave them the boon they wanted (श्राद्धेश्माकं भवेदंशो ह्येष नः कांक्षितो वरः) and the pitṛs agreed. The pitṛs said (verse 13) 'अग्रे दत्त्वा तु युष्माकमस्माकं दास्यते ततः । विसर्जनमथास्माकं पूर्वे पश्चात्तु दैवतम् ॥'.THIS legend is obviously an attempt to explain the usage about Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas at a श्राद्ध.

The Mit. on Yaj. I. 229, Hemadri (on śrāddha p. 1225) and other digests state that the mantras for invoking the Viśvedevas in Pārvaṇa-śrāddha are two viz. 'Viśvedevāsa āgata' (Ṛg. II, 41.13) and 'āgacchantu mahābhāgā' (q. above in note 984), while the Sm. C. (p. 444) prescribes an additional mantra 'viśve devāḥ śruņuta' (Ṛg. VI. 52. 13).

The general rule is that the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas are to be seated facing the east and the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas facing the north (Yāj. I. 228, Varāha 14. 11), but there were at least five differing views about the directions which the brāhmaṇas were to face as Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 1200) points out. It is further pointed out by Hemādri and others (like Yāj. I. 247) that in all items in the procedure of śrāddha the Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇas have precedence except in the matter of washing the hand smeared with the remains of food and the final dismissal of the brāhmaṇas at the end of the śrāddha[^1019]. It may be noted that in southern and western India brāhmaṇas invited at śrāddha are worshipped, while in Bengal it is the effigy made with darbhas (darbhabatu) that is worshipped as shown by the late M. M. Haraprasad Shastri (Catalogue of Mss, vol. III p. 406). The Śrāddha-tattva (folio 2b) of Raghunandana provides for the same: '_purūravā-mādravasor viśveşām devānām pārvaṇa-śrāddham kuśamayabrāhmane karişye iti pṛcchet_.'

In the Vāyupurāṇa[^1020] it is stated that the following mantra should be repeated thrice at the beginning and end of a śrāddha and at the time of offering piṇḍas; on repeating it the pitṛs come quickly to the śrāddha and rāksasas run away and that the mantra saves the pitṛs in all the three worlds. The mantra is 'Perpetual adoration to the gods, to pitṛs and to the great _Yogins_, to svadhā, to svāhā'.

The मन्त्र occurs in गरुडपुराण (आचारखण्ड) 218. 6. कल्पतरु (श्रा.) p. 144 quotes these. In most other purānas the मन्त्र ends 'नित्यमेत्र नमो नमः'. हेमाद्रि (on श्राद्ध pp. 1079 and 1208) calls it सप्तार्चिस् and notes that it occurs in seven puranas. It is stated in some works that the reading भवन्त्युत is for followers of सामवेद. अत्र सम्बन्धनामगोत्रशब्दानां नानाक्रमदर्शनाद्विकल्पः। स ऐच्छिकः शाखाभेदेन वा व्यवस्थितः । श्रा. प्र. p. 29.

## 'Saptārcis' mantra

The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 441) states that the mantra should be repeated after the brāhmaṇas come and sit down and before kušas are placed on the seats of the brāhmaṇas. This mantra occurs also in Brahmapurāṇa 220.143, Brahmāṇḍa (Upodghātapāda 11. 22), Viṣṇudharmottara I. 140, 68-70 and is styled 'saptārcis' by the last two and is said to be equal to Aśvamedha.

A certain order of words about referring to the ancestors in offering a seat, offering kuśas on seat, and _arghya_ is laid down by Bṛhaspati[^1021], some of the purāṇas and the digests. As almost in every case there are different views here also. Bṛhaspati says: 'when giving a seat, when offering _arghya_, or piṇḍas, in offering ablutions of water on piṇḍas, the performer has to declare his relation to each of the ancestors, the names and _gotras_ of the ancestors and also the form in which each of the ancestors is to be contemplated (viz, as Vasu, Rudra, Āditya respectively). It is further laid down that the genitive is to be employed for the ancestor's name in offering a seat ( to the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇa) and _aksayyodaka_, the objective in invoking the pitṛs, the dative in offering food, the vocative in other cases.

It is laid down that the perfornier has to take _ācamana_(sip water) in śrāddha rite six times viz., at the commencement of śrāddha, when washing the feet of invited brāhmaṇas, in worshipping them, in making the _vikira_, in offering piṇḍas and at the end of the śrāddha[^1022].

The formula may be 'ओं अमुकगोत्राणामामुकशर्मणामस्मत्पितॄणां सपत्नीकानां वसुरूपाणामिदमासनम्; then in place of पितॄणां पितामहानां and प्रपितामहानां and in place of वसुरूपाणां, रुद्ररूपाणां and आदित्यरूपाणां will have to be respectively employed. The words may also be employed in the singular as the स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p.449) says 'एतासु च षष्ठ्यादि विभक्तिषु सर्वत्रैकवचनबहुवचनयोर्विकल्प एव स्मृतिपुराणगृह्यादिषु पितृपितामहादिशब्दानां क्वचिदेकवचनान्तया क्वचिद्वहुवचनान्त या च प्रयोगदर्शनात्'।.

An important question which exercised the minds of many medieval writers was 'who was the real recipient (_sampradāna_)[^1023] of the offerings made in śrāddha, whether the brāhmaṇas or the pitṛs'. Relying on the words of the Āśv. gr. IV.8.1 (quoted above in n. 966 'etasmin kāle ... dānam') and passages of the purāņas such as the Varāha (13. 51) 'vibhave sati viprebhyo asmān uddiśya dāsyati', the Mahārnavaprakāśa, Harihara and some others held that brāhmaṇas were the recipients, while others like Sridatta, relying on indications furnished by _śruti_ passages like Vāj. S. 19. 36 (_akşan pitaraḥ amimadanta pitaraḥ_) and such formulas as '_pitar-etat te arghyam_' or '_etadvaḥ pitaro vāsaḥ_,' held that the real recipients intended were the pitṛs, but, as the pitṛs had gone to another world and could not be bodily present to receive the gifts of such things as sandlewood paste, flowers and clothes, the latter were only handed over or assigned to the brāhmaṇas who were for the moment contemplated as not different from the pitṛs[^1023a]. Vide Sm. C. (śrāddha pp. 447-449 ), Śr. Pr. pp. 30-31 for a discussion of these two view points. It should, however, be noted that the water given to the brāhmaṇas and the _dakşiņā_ given to them were only meant for the brāhmaṇas, the former for purification and the latter for the inexhaustible merit that dakşiņā to brāhmaṇas conferred.

It is to be noted that in the invocation (_āvāhana_) of the pitṛs there is a divergence of views as to the mantras to be employed and also as to the stage when it is to be made. Hemādri (śrāddha, pp. 1254-56) states that there were five different views on the latter point, the three most important of which were that _āvāhana_ should come before giving darbhas as _āsana_ on the left side of the seats of the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas or after giving such darbhas or after _agnaukaraṇa_. As regards the former (viz. the mantras), Yāj. (I. 232-233), the Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa and several others say that the invocation mantra is 'uśantas-tvā' (Ṛg. X. 16. 12, Vāj. S. 19. 70, Tai. S. II. 6.12.1) and after the _āvāhana_ the performer should perform _japa_ of the verse 'ā yantu naḥ' (Vāj. S. 19.58). The Viṣṇudharmasutra[^1024] (73. 10-12) states "the performer after having received permission from the brāhmaṇas should invite the Manes. Having driven away the _Yātudhānas_ (demons) by strewing grains of sesamum and by reciting the two mantras (the first of which begins with 'may the Asuras go away') he should invite the Manes with the four mantras 'come near, ye Manes!', 'conduct them here, O Agni!', 'May my (ancestors ) come near', 'this is your (share), O Manes'".

[^1023]: For the meaning of संप्रदान, vide पा. I. 4. 32 'कर्मणा यमभिप्रैति स संप्रदानम्'.

[^1023a]: Vide n. 911 for the विष्णुपुराण passage (III. 14. 22-23 ) which means 'that will give jewels &c to brāhmaṇas for our benefit'.

[^1024]: ततो ब्राह्मणानुज्ञातः पितॄनावाहयेत् । अपयन्त्वसुरा इति द्वाभ्यां तिलैयातुधानानां विसर्जनं कृत्वा । एत पितरः सर्वोस्तानग्न आ मे यन्त्वेतद्वः पितर इत्यावाहनं कृत्वा ...विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 73. 10--12. The commentator notes that here it is the काठकीय-श्राद्ध प्रयोग that is set out. Compare काठकगृह्य 63.2-4, 10 for all these mantras except one 'पितृनावाहयिष्यामीत्युक्त्वा । अपयन्त्वसुरा इति द्वाभ्यां तिलैः सर्वतोऽवकीर्य। एत पितर आगच्छत पितर आ मे यन्त्वन्तर्दधे पर्वतैरिति जपित्वा। ये मामकाः पितर एतद्वः पितरोंऽयं यज्ञ इति तिसृभिः कल्पितान्नमभिमृशति । Dr. Caland (the editor) notes that these are not found in the printed काठकसंहिता. The विष्णुधर्मोत्तर ( I. 140. 9-10) corresponds with the विष्णुधर्मसूत्र completely as to the mantras. अन्तर्दधे पर्वतैः-is आप. म. पा. II. 19. 4.

## Mantras of āvāhana

Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1260-1267) points out how the mantras differ according to different writers.

There is a great deal of discussion about _agnaukaraṇa_ mentioned in Yaj. I. 236-237. The Mit. points out that if a man has kept śrauta fires by the _sarvādhāna_ method then in the pārvaņa-śrāddha that he offers after piṇḍapitṛyajña he offers homa in the Dakşiņāgni, as he has no _aupāsana_ (i.e. gṛhya) fire and supports this by quoting a passage which occurs in the Viṣṇudharmottara-purāṇa[^1025]. But if a man consecrates the śrauta fires by the ardhādhāna[^1026] method, then he has to offer pārvaṇa homa in the _aupāsana_ fire and one who is without śrauta fires and has kept up only aupāsana fire has to offer _homa_ in that fire. One who has neither the śrauta fires nor the gṛhya fire offers it in the brāhmaṇa's hand only. The Mit. relies on Manu III. 212 and on two verses from a gṛhya and comes to the conclusion that one who has consecrated śrauta fires performs homa in daksina fire in the case of Anvaṣṭakya śrāddha, the śrāddha on the day previous to Aṣṭakā, the śrāddha performed in the dark half of each month on some day from the 5th and in the case of pārvaṇa-śrāddha, but he performs, in the case of _kāmya_, ābhyudayika, Ekoddiṣṭa and Aṣṭakā śrāddhas, _homa_ only on the pitṛya brāhmaṇa's hand; while for one who has kept no sacred fire the _homa_ is to be made only in the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇa's hand. Vide Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1328-1344), Bālambhatti (on ācāra p. 518). The Todarānanda (śrāddhasaukhya ) following Manu III. 282 states that one who is an Agnihotrin cannot perform a pārvaṇa-śrāddha on any day except on _darśa_ (i.e, on amāvāsyā).

[^1025]: यथाह मार्कण्डेयः । आहिताग्निस्तु जुहुयाद्दक्षिणाग्नौ समाहितः । अनाहिताग्निस्त्वौपसदे अग्न्यभावे द्विजेप्सु वा ॥ मिता. on या. I. 236. This is विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I, 140. 18, as हेमाद्रि says 'तदेतदाह विष्णुधर्मोत्तरे मार्कण्डेयः । (श्रा. p. 1330).

[^1026]: For सर्वाधान and अर्धाधान, vide above n, 991, यतः श्राद्धाङ्गमग्नौकरण होमो लौकिकाग्नौ न युक्तः किंतु दक्षिणाग्नावेव स च दर्श एव भवति । अतो दर्शन विना नाग्निहोत्रिणः श्राद्धम्। टोडरानन्द (on श्राद्ध folio 24a). ने दर्शेन विना श्राद्धमाहिताग्ने द्विजन्मनः॥ मनु III. 282, which कुल्लूक explains as 'आहिताग्नोर्द्वजस्य नामावास्याव्यति रेकेण कृष्णपक्षे दशम्यादौ श्राद्धं विधीयते.'

Another important question on which there is great divergence concerns the number of āhutis to be offered in _agnaukaraṇa_, the deities to whom the homa was to be offered, the order in which the deities were to be named and the form of words to be used. On these matters there appears to have been divergent views from very ancient times. According to the Śat. Br. II, 4. 2. 12-13 the āhutis were only[^1027] two, they were offered to Agni and Soma in that order and the word svāhā was used at the end. According to the Tai. Br. I, 3.10.2–3[^1028] the āhutis were three, they were to be offered to Soma, Agni and to Yama in that order and the formula ended with 'svadhā namaḥ' (and not with 'svāhā'). It is therefore that a verse of Kātyāyana[^1029] says "whether to employ the word 'svāhā' or the words 'svadhā namaḥ', whether and when to wear the sacred chord in the yajñopavīta form or prācināvita form and what was to be the number of āhutis-all these have to be understood from one's own sūtra." The difference of views which is noticed as far back as the Brāhmanas persists in the sütras, smṛtis, purāṇas and is briefly indicated here.

[^1027]: स जुहोति । अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वाहा सोमाय पितृमते स्वाहेत्यत्यग्नौ मेक्षणमभ्यादधाति तत्स्विष्टकृद्भाजनम् । शतपथब्रा. II. 4. 2. 13. The words अग्नये... पितृमते स्वाहा are वाज. सं. II. 29.

[^1028]: सोमाय पितृपीताय स्वधा नम इत्याह । ... अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नम इत्याह य एव पितॄणामग्निस्तं प्रीणाति । तिस्र आहुतीर्जुहोति । तै. बा. I. 3. 10.2-3, on which सायण explains 'शाखान्तरगतेन यमायाङ्गिरस्वते पितृमते स्वधा नम इति मन्त्रेणैकामाहुतिमाभिप्रेत्य त्रित्वं विदधाति'. Vide अथर्व. 18. 4. 71-74 also. आप. श्री. (I. 8. 3-4 and 6) says 'सोमाय पितृपीताय स्वधा नम इति दक्षिणाग्नौ जुहोति । यमायाङ्गिरस्वते पितृमते स्वधा नम इति द्वितीयाम् । अग्नये कन्यवाहनाय स्वधा नम इति तृतीयाम्। न यमाय - जुहोतीत्येके।'.

## Number of āhutis

The Ap. Gr. S. (quoted above in n. 981 ) speaks of thirteen āhutis, seven with food and six with clarified butter. Two āhutis only are mentioned by Aśv. Śrauta II. 6. 12 (quoted in note 974), Asv. gx. IV. 7.20, ŚaṇkhaLikhita[^1030] Kathaka-gṛhya, Nārada-purāṇa (pārvārdha 28. 48 ) and Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa. Three āhutis are mentioned by most of the smṛtis and purāṇas, such as Baud. Dh. S. II. 14.7, 1031 San. Śrauta IV. 3 and gṛhya IV. 1. 13, Viṣṇu Dh, S. 73. 12, Manu III. 211,Varahapurāṇa[^1032] (14.21-22), Brahmāṇḍa-purāṇa (Upodghatapāda 11.93-94), Viṣṇudharmottara I. 140.19. It is here that various combinations of the order of the deities and of the words 'svāhā' and 'svadhā' occur. The texts of a few works are cited below for illustration. Some give the order as 'Soma accompanied by the pitṛs, Agni the carrier of _kavya_, Yama Angiras;' while others give it as 'Agni the carrier of _kavya_, Soma accompanied by the pitṛs, Yama Vaivasvata &c.' It is further provided that the _āhuti_ to Agni is made to the southern side of the fire, to Soma on the northern part of it and in the middle of the two sides to Vaivasvata (Yama )[^1033].

Various rules of etiquette about serving food, about the way brāhmaṇas are to eat and related matters have been laid down from ancient times and are observed even now. The Sm. C. (p. 465-470 ), Hemadri (Śrāddha pp. 1367-1384), the Sr. Pr. pp. 116-123 and other digests contain elaborate rules on these matters. Yāj. I. 237 prescribes that what remains after offering homa should be served in the plates meant for the brāhmaṇas representing the Fathers and the plates should preferably be of silver.

[^1030]: धूपगन्धमाल्यैरलङ्कत्य ब्राह्मणान्सघृतमन्नमनुज्ञाप्य दर्भेर्दक्षिणायैरग्निं परिस्तीर्य जुहुयादगंये कव्यवाहनाय स्वाहां सोमाय पितृमते स्वाहेति । शङ्कलिखितौ q. by हेमाद्रि (श्रा. p. 1354), मद. पा. p. 589: अग्नौ करवाणीत्युक्त्वा । अग्निं परिस्तीर्य सोमाय पितृमते स्वधा नमोऽग्नये कन्यवाहनाय स्वधा नम इत्यग्नौ हुत्वा। काठकगृह्य 63.89; उपासनाग्निमाधाय स्वगृह्योक्तविधानतः । सोमाय च पितृमते स्वधा नम इतीरयेत् ॥ अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नम इतीह वा । स्वाहान्तेनापि वा प्राज्ञो जुहुयात्पितृयज्ञवत् ॥ नारद (पूर्वार्ध 28, 48-49).

II. 8. 8-12. It should be noted that बो. employs both स्वधा नमः and स्वाहा. अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वाहा सोमाय पितृमते स्वाहा यमायाङ्गिरस्वते पितृमते स्वाहेति । शाङ्खायनश्रौत. IV. 4.1.

[^1033]: दक्षिणतोऽग्नये नित्यं सोमारोत्तरतस्तथा । एतयोरन्तरे नित्यं जुहुयाद्वै विवस्वतै ॥ q. by कल्पतरु (श्रा. p.169).

Kātyāyana says that the performer who has no fire (either śrauta or smārta ) should offer the homa on the hand of the most eminent among the pitṛya brāhmaṇas to the accompaniment of a mantra and should offer the remainder in the plates of the other pitṛya brāhmaṇas[^1034]. The Sm. C. notes that Yama and the Vāyupurāṇa say that the homa should be in the hand of the _daiva_ brāhmaṇa and that on account of this conflict there is an option. It is further provided that a portion of the food from which agnaukaraṇa was effected should be kept aside for making piṇḍas (Mārkaṇḍeya and Garuda). The food should be served by the performer himself wearing the sacred thread in the _yajñopavīta_ form or by his wife of the same caste or by some attendant who is purified. Manu (III. 224-229, 231-233, 236-238) contains several rules[^1034a]. 'Himself holding the vessels full of food with both hands the performer should slowly place them near the brāhmaṇas seated for dinner while thinking of his ancestors. That food, which is brought near the brāhmaṇas without (the containing vessel being held in ) both hands, is snatched away by wicked _asuras_. The performer being himself pure and concentrating his mind (only on the serving of food ) should place the vessels containing the side dishes viz. broths, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee and honey on the ground and not on a wooden stool or the like). The vessels placed on the ground should contain various kinds of food (such as sweetmeats, _pāyasa_), fruits and roots, delicious flesh, spiced or perfumed drinks.

[^1034]: पित्र्ये यः पङ्क्तिमूर्धन्यस्तस्य पाणावनग्निमान् । हुत्वा मन्त्रवदन्येषां तूष्णीं पात्रेषु निक्षिपेत् । गोभिल II. 120 q. by स्मृतिच. II. p. 462.

[^1034a]: मनु III, 225 is almost the same as Baud, Dh. S. II. 8.22 and Vas. XI. 25. मनु III. 224 is of पाणिभ्यां तूपसंगृह्य स्वयमन्नस्य वर्धितम् । विमान्तिके पितृध्यायञ् शनकैरुपनिक्षिपेत्॥. अन्नस्य is to be taken as अन्नेन and पिठरं is to be understood after वर्धितम्. The श्राद्धतत्व (p. 229) explains: 'पाकस्थाल्या आकृष्य प्रथमं | भोजनपात्रे न देयं किन्तु स्थाल्यादिकं पाणिभ्यां पात्रसमीपे भूमौ संस्थाप्य पश्चादुभाभ्यां पाणिभ्यां पात्रान्तरिताभ्यां श्राद्ध परिवेशयत्'। and relies on मत्स्य 17.28 'उभाभ्यामपि हस्ताभ्यामाहृत्य परिवेशयेत्', ब्रह्मोद्याश्च-मनु III. 231. ब्रह्मोद्यs are such riddles, questions and answers as are found in Tai. S. VII. 4. 18, वाज. सं. 23.9-12 (कः स्विदेकाकी चरति etc.) and 23. 45-62 ; Ait. Br. (अथ ब्रह्मोद्यं वदन्त्यग्निर्गृहपतिरिति हैक आहुः॥). Or ब्रह्मोद्य may mean, as explained by मेधा (ब्रह्मणि वेदे या उद्यन्ते कथ्यन्ते ता ब्रह्मोद्याः), the legends of the wars of gods and asuras, the slaughter of Vṛtra, the story of Saramā &c. Or ब्रह्मोद्याः कथा: may mean 'talks relating to the exposition of Brahma ' (the cause of the world), as Kullaka explains. विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 81. 19 is हविर्गुणान्न ब्राह्मणा ब्रूयुर्दात्रा पृष्टाः. This is like Manu III. 236. मनु III. 237 is the same as वसिष्ठ XI. 32, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 81. 20. Angiras verse 133, Bṛhad-Yama III. 27, Laghu-Satatapa 103 Viṣṇudharmottara I. 140.46. About the sacred texts and other verses to be recited by the performer (being upavitin ) while the brāhmanas are dining vide above p. 445 and notes 994 and 994a. जमदग्नि says 'अपसव्येन कर्तव्यं सर्वे श्राद्धं यथाविधि । सूक्तस्तोत्रजपं मुक्त्वा विप्राणां च विसर्जनम् ।' q. by श्राद्धप्र of पृथ्वीच folio 101a.

## Rules about serving food

Having brought near the brāhmaṇas all the vessels containing food, he should serve it in the plates declaring the characteristic of each kind of food (saying 'this is sweet, this is sour' &c.). The performer while serving should not shed tears (remembering his ancestors ), he should not become angry, should not utter falsehood, he should not touch the vessel containing ) food with his foot and should not serve food with a violent jerk. Whatever is liked by the brāhmaṇas should be served to them without any grumbling and he should talk about Brahma (or about Vedic riddles ), because that is agreeable to the pitṛs. The performer himself, being pleased, should ( by his sweet speech ) gladden the brāhmaṇas, should make them partake of food without hurry, and should urge them on frequently (to take more food) by declaring the good points of the various items of food. All food should be steaming hot and the brāhmaṇas should partake of it silently and should not themselves speak of the good points of the food even when questioned by the performer. When the food is hot, when the brāhmaṇas eat in silence and when the good qualities of the food are not declared by the brāhmaṇas, the Fathers partake of it. When a brāhmaṇa (at a śrāddha dinner) partakes of food, having his head covered with a garment (a turban &c)or facing the south or having his sandals on, evil spirits partake of the food (and not the Fathers).' As early as Gaut., it is provided that the food for the brāhmaṇas should be of the highest sort and should be enriched by condiments and flavoured.

Some of the other rules are : The Prajāpati-smṛti (verses 57-62 ) states who should cook the food for the śrāddha dinner. The wife, any fortunate (or handsome) woman of the performer's gotra whose husband is living and who has a son or brother and is devoted to waiting upon her elders, the performer's teacher's wife, his maternal uncle's wife, paternal or maternal aunt, his sister, his daughter or daughter-in-law, all of them having their husbands alive, should engage in the cooking, of the food for śrāddha. Women of good family, who have a large progeny, whose husbands are alive and who are about 50 years old or these women if they have become widows, and the wife of one's paternal uncle or brother, one's mothers (natural or step-mothers ) and the mothers of one's father may cook the śrāddha food and also a woman of the same gotra who is mild by temper. In the Anušāsana parva (92.15) it is stated that a woman belonging to a gotra other than that of the deceased should not be employed for cooking śrāddha food. One's brother, paternal uncle, brother's son, sister's son, one's son, pupil, one's daughter's son or daughter's husband may also engage in cooking the śrāddha food, but not a woman who wears a white and wet garment, who has let her hair loose, who does not wear a bodice, who is ill or who has bathed her head. Before the brāhmaṇas begin to eat, the food should be first served in the plates for the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas and then in those of the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas (Viṣṇu Dh. S. 173. 13-14), but once the brāhmaṇas have begun to eat there is no such precedence; whatever each brāhmaṇa may be noted as requiring should be served to him (as indicated by Manu III, 231). The performer of the śrāddha when serving food to the brāhmaṇas (including pitṛya) wears his sacred thread in the upavita form. Though it is said that the food should be hot, that does not apply to such eatables as curds, fruits and roots and flavoured[^1035] drinks (as Śaṇkha XIV.13 and Skandapurāṇa say ). As Hemādri (śrāddha p. 1371) points out, the serving of food in a śrāddha rite should be done with the right hand supported by the left; besides, nothing should be served with the bare hand or with a single hand, but with a wooden ladle or other utensil (but not an iron one). All cooked food, all side dishes and ghee should be served with a ladle (and not with the bare hand) but not water or eatables like _laddus_. No salt was to be directly served (Viṣṇu Dh. S, 79.12). In Kātyāyana's Śrāddha-sūtra it is provided[^1036] "The food that remains after _agnaukaraṇa_ should be served in the plates of the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas and the performer should touch each plate for those brāhmaṇas after repeating the mantra 'the earth is thy vessel, the sky is the cover, I offer nectar in the brāhmaṇa's nectar-like mouth; svāhā'. Then the performer plunges the (right) thumb of the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇa in the food (the remains of the homa in fire) with the ṛk or yajus addressed to Viṣṇu; and after scattering sesamum grains all round the place where the dinner is to go on with the mantra (the asuras and rākṣasas) are struck and driven away' he (the performer) should serve hot food very much liked (by the departed or by the brāhmaṇas)".

[^1035]: उष्णमन्नं द्विजातिभ्यः श्रद्ध या विनिवेशयेत् ॥ अन्यत्र फलपुष्पेभ्यः पानकेभ्यश्च पण्डितः॥ हस्ते दावा तु वै स्नेहाँल्लवणव्यञ्जनानि च । आयसेन च पात्रेण तद्वै रक्षांसि भुञ्जते ॥ स्कन्दपुराण VII. 206. 37-39; शङ्ख (14.12-13) has the first verse but with slight variations and also कूर्म II. 22. 64 ; शक्तितः प्रकर्षेद् गुणसंस्कारविधिरन्नस्य । गौ.15.6.

1036. पिण्डपितृयज्ञवद्धुत्वा हुतशेषं दत्त्वा पात्रमालभ्य जपति पृथिवी ते पात्रं द्यौरपिधानं ब्राह्मणस्य मुखे अमृते अमृतं जुहोमि स्वाहेति वैष्णव्यर्चा यजुषा वाङ्गष्ठमन्नेऽवगाह्यापहता इति तिलान् प्रकीर्योष्णं स्विष्टमन्नं दद्याच्छक्त्या वा। कात्या० श्राद्धसूत्र 3 quoted and explained by हेमाद्रि on श्राद्ध p 1374. The वैष्णवी ṛk is 'इदं विष्णुर्विचक्रमे'। (ऋ.I. 22.17) and वैष्णवी _yajus_ is 'विष्णो हव्यं रक्षस्व'। (ते. सं. I. 1. 3. 1. वाज. सं.I.4). अपहताः -- is वाज. सं.II. 29.

Yāj. I. 238 briefly refers (as translated above ) to the mantras and the item of plunging the thumb of the brāhmaṇas in the food; and so does the Baud. Dh. S. also (II.8.15-16). The Kalika-purāṇa prescribes[^1037] that the thumb of the brāhmaṇa should be moved about in the food covered with ghee and honey with the mantra “the earth is thy vessel &c.' because Viṣṇu in the form of the thumb protects food meant for sacrifices to gods and manes. The Baud. Pitṛmedhasūtra provides that while plunging the thumb of the brāhmaṇa in the food served it should be so arranged that the nail of the thumb is not smeared with food[^1038]. Vasiṣṭha provides that the brāhmaṇas eating śrāddha food should always hold the plate from which they are eating with (the left ) hand till the end of the dinner. Śaṇkha-Likhita provide[^1039] that brāhmaṇas (eating śrāddha food ) should not declare the good or bad points of the food served, should not say what is untrue, should not praise each other, nor should they say 'there is plenty of food and drink (and so do not serve more food ), except by signs made with the hand.' Whatever is offered in a brāhmaṇa's hand (by way of agnaukaraṇa) and whatever food is placed in the plates should be mixed up and eaten. Hemādri quotes passages from the Maitrāyaniya-sūtra and from the Skandapurāņa setting out the mantras wherewith certain articles were to be served; e. g. the Skandapurāṇa says that _pāyasa_ should be served with the verse 'namo vah pitaro' (Vāj. S. II. 32. Tai. S. III, 2.5.5), clarified butter with the mantra 'Tejosi śukram', curds with the mantra 'dadhikrāvno' (Ṛg. IV. 39.6, Vāj. S. 23. 32, Tai. S. 1. 5. 11. 4). Ap. Dh, S. (II. 8. 18. 11) provides that the leavings of a śrāddha dinner should not be given to one who is inferior to the invited brāhmaṇas in qualities and Manu III. 249 states that the man who after eating śrāddha dinner gives the leavings to a śüdra falls in the Kālasūtra Hell.

The Matsyapurāṇa and some other works provide that the brāhmaṇas should pronounce blessings on the performer (who faces the east) after they have sipped water and have been given water, flowers and _akşata_ grains. The performer prays 'May our Fathers be not terrible (i, e, be kind) to us. The brāhmaṇas reply "let it be so'. The performer prays 'May our family grow', 'May donors increase in our family and also food', ‘May these blessings turn out to be true'. To all these the brāhmaṇas reply after each one of the prayers[^1040] 'May it be so'. There are rules about the time when the leavings or particles of food in the plates of the brāhmaṇas that ate the dinner should be removed or swept away. Vas. (XI. 21-22) and the Kūrmapurāņa provide that the leavings of food should not be removed till the Sun sets, since streams of nectar flow from them, which are drunk by the (spirits of) those departed persons for whom no water was offered. Manu III. 265 (which is the same as Matsya 17.56 and Padma, Sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa 9.185) provides another rule that the leavings of the food in the plates may remain where they are till the brāhmaṇas are dismissed and depart.

## Rules about removal of leavings

Hemadri (Śrāddha, p. 1512 )[^1041] therefore provides that if the performer has another house the leavings may not be removed till sunset, but if he has only one house, they may be removed after the brāhmaṇas have gone away (vide Yāj. I. 257, Matsya 17.56 ). It is further provided by Bṛhaspati[^1042] that the plates should not be removed before the brāhmaṇas pronounce the word 'svasti', and Jatūkarṇya[^1043] and the Skandapurāṇa say that the plates and the leavings should be removed by the performer himself or by his pupil or son, but not by women nor by a child nor by one who is not of the same caste. Manu III. 258 provides that, after the brāhmaṇas have left, the performer should look at the south and pray to the pitṛs for certain blessings contained in Manu III, 259 which are the same as Yāj. I 246 translated above (vide p. 447), Viṣṇu Dh. S. 73.28, Matsya 16.49-50. The Ap. gr. 20.9 (q. in note 981), Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17.16, Manu III, 264, Yāj. I. 249 provide that the performer should partake of the remainder of the food cooked for the śrāddha along with his wife, paternal and maternal relatives after reciting (according to Haradatta) the Yājuṣa mantra (Ap. M. P. II. 20.26) which means 'entering the life breath I offer nectar; my soul is centred in Brahman for the sake of immortality'. The Ap. gr. and Ap. Dh. S. provide[^1044] that the performer must eat at least a morsel of the food left after serving to the brāhmaṇas. Vyāsa and Devala prescribe that on the day of śrāddha the performer must not observe a fast (even if he usually does so as on Ekādaśī or Sivarātra). A way out was provided by the Brahmavaivarta-purāṇa by recommending that the performer should merely smell the remnants of the śrāddha food.

Vide Hemādri (śrāddha, pp. 1519-1521) for the discussion. Hemādri (p. 1485) refers to the practice (observed even now) that after the performer receives the blessings referred to above, his son, grandson and the like should offer adoration to the _devatās_ in the form of piṇḍas. The brāhmaṇas should praise the good characteristics of the food served at the end of the śrāddha ceremony[^1045]. The brāhmaṇas should not get up from the dinner, carelessly leaving remnants of food in their plates, but they may leave in the plates a little food except milk, curds, honey or barley flour[^1046].

There were several views as to the exact stage at which the offerings of piṇḍas were to be made. According to Sān. Gr. IV. 1.9., Āśv. gr. IV. 8. 12, 1047 Śaṇkha 14.11, Manu III. 260-261, Yāj. I. 242 and several other works, the performer offers the lumps of boiled rice after the brāhmaṇas have finished eating their dinner. The piṇḍas are made with boiled rice mixed with sesame and are placed on darbhas on a clean spot and at a distance of about one aratni from[^1048] the plates in which the brāhmaṇas ate and the performer faces the south. Here again there are two opinions, one being that piṇḍas were to be offered before the brāhmaṇas sip water (perform _ācamana_) after dinner (e. g. āśv. gr. IV. 8. 12–13, Śrāddha-sūtra of Kātyāyana, kaņdikā 3), while others hold that they were to be offered after the brāhmaṇas have rinsed their mouth and taken _ācamana_. Another view referred to as the view of some by Sān. gr. IV. 1.10 and Manu III, 261 was that piṇḍas were to be offered to the ancestors first after honouring the invited brāhmaņas or after agnaukaraṇa and then the brāhmaṇas were to partake of the dinner.

Acc. to मनु III. 245-46. विष्णु 81 22-23, मत्स्य 17.56-57, the leavings of food in the plates of ब्राह्मणs and the विकिर were the lot of persons of the family dying young, while the leavings of food that fell or were left on the ground were the share of deceased slaves.

## Time of offering piṇḍas

The Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa[^1049] emphatically asserts that this is the correct position as stated by Bṛhaspati. The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (73 15-24) provides that the piṇḍas are to be offered to the ancestors while the brāhmaṇas are actually eating. A fourth view is that of the Ap. gr. 24.9, Hir. gr. (II. 12.2-3) which state that the performer[^1050] should, after the brāhmaṇas have eaten and gone away and he has followed and circumambulated them, offer piṇḍas. Owing to this conflict of views Hemādri (quoting smṛti) and the Madanapārijāta (p. 600) say that each one should follow the procedure laid down in his own śākhā[^1051]. Hemādri adds that those in whose gṛhyasūtra no special time is mentioned for piṇḍadāna should follow the view that piṇḍas are to be offered after the brāhmaṇas have partaken of the dinner and sipped water. The Sr. P. (p.247) endorses this view[^1052]. The piṇḍas were to be deposited on bunches of (25) darbhas for each piṇḍa. Aparārka on Yāj. I. 24 states that in all cases without exception piṇḍas were to be offered near the plates from which the brāhmaṇas took their meals, while Hemādri who relies on Katyayana's word 'ucchiṣṭasannidhau' says that where the performer is an _āhitāgni_ the piṇḍas were to be offered near his sacred fire, but when a performer had not kept the sacred fires piṇḍas were to be offered near the plates from which brāhmaṇas ate the śrāddha food. The Śrāddhasāra (p. 163) quotes Atri to the effect that piṇḍas should be offered at a distance of three _aratnis_ from where the brāhmaṇas ate the śrāddha dinner and that in such śrāddhas as Navaśrāddhas Vaišvadeva is to be performed before piṇḍadana and that it is to be performed after piṇḍadāna in Samvatsarika śrāddha, Mahālaya and the like (p. 164).

These verses are quoted from ब्रह्मपुराण by कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 221). The सौरपुराण 19. 23 says 'पिण्डनिर्वपणं कृत्वा ब्राह्मणांश्चैव भोजयेत्। केचिदप्येवमिच्छन्ति नैव भानोर्मतं द्विजाः'॥

There is another conflict of views as regards the ancestors to whom piṇḍas are to be offered at the śrāddha on amāvāsya. Most of the ancient Vedic works refer only to the three paternal ancestors as the _devatās_ of the Pārvaṇa-śrāddha and not to any other relatives. The three paternal ancestors are separately the _devatās_ of śrāddha and not cumulatively, as indicated by the Āśv. Śrauta II. 6.15 and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 73.13-14. The important questions are whether the wives of the paternal ancestors, viz, the mother, the grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother were associated with their husbands in ancient times and secondly, whether the three paternal ancestors of one's mother viz. the maternal grandfather, the maternal great-grandfather and the maternal great-great-grandfather were invoked together with their wives in the Pārvaṇa. The answer to both these questions so far as the Vedas and Brāhmanas are concerned is in the negative. Vide Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I. 3. 10, II, 6. 16, Vāj. S. 19. 36-37, Sat. Br. II, 4.2. 16, in all of which the only persons expressly named are the pitṛs and three paternal ancestors. It may be noted, however, that in Vāj. S. 9. 19 (which is cited by Kātyāyana at the end of Śrāddhasūtra 3 as the mantra to be recited when following the brāhmaṇas that are dismissed) there is a clear reference to paternal ancestors and also to mothers. Almost all sūtras also are silent as regards the invocation of the maternal ancestors in Pārvaņa-śrāddha along with paternal ones. Vide[^1053] Āśv. Śr.; Sudarśana on Ap. gr. VIII. 21. 2 states that the Sūtrakāra and Bhāṣyakāra did not speak of Mātāmahaśrāddha as it is not obligatory for a daughter's son to offer it. The Śrāddhasūtra of Katyāyana[^1054] speaks of three piṇḍas being made for the paternal ancestors and three for the mother's paternal ancestors.

## Ancestors to whom piṇḍas were offered

The Gobhilasmṛti provides[^1055] that six piṇḍas should be offered except in the Anvaṣṭakāśrāddha, the first śrāddha (on the 11th day), the sixteen śrāddhas and the yearly śrāddha for a deceased person. Dhaumya[^1056] prescribes that where the paternal ancestors are honoured (or fed) the maternal ancestors also should be certainly honoured without making any difference (between the two classes ); if he makes a distinction the performer will go to Hell. The Viṣṇupurāṇa[^1057] the Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa and the Varāhapurāṇa say that some hold that a śrāddha for maternal ancestors is to be performed separately while other sages hold that one śrāddha is to be offered at the same time to the paternal and maternal ancestors. Bṛhaspati (q. by Kalpataru on śrāddha p. 204) prescribes[^1058] that one should offer piṇḍas made from all food cooked for the śrāddha and mixed with honey and sesamum grains for both paternal and maternal ancestors according to the rules of one's gṛhyasūtra. The Varāhapurāṇa (14. 40-41) says that _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas should be dismissed first and then the daiva brāhmaṇas together with those for the mother's ancestors and that separate piṇḍas were to be offered to the mother's paternal ancestors (14.37). Some held the view that the offering of piṇḍas to maternal ancestors was obligatory for the _putrikāputra_[^1059] (son of the appointed daughter) or for a daughter's son that inherited the wealth of his maternal grandfather. Bṛhat-Parāśara (chap. V. p. 153) mentions several views on this point.

It seems probable that when the appointment of a daughter as a son became rare or went out of vogue the maternal ancestors came to be associated with the paternal ancestors in pārvaṇa-śrāddha.

The question when the wives of ancestors became associated with the male ancestors cannot be solved satisfactorily. The _pitāmahi_ is not mentioned in the extant Vedic Literature. But it is certain that the wives of male ancestors had come to be associated with their husbands in the sūtra period. For example, the Hir. Gr. II, 10 associates the mother, the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother with their respective husbands in the monthly śrāddha performed in the dark half. Similarly, the Baud. gr. II. 11.34 not only associates in the Aṣṭakā śrāddha the male maternal ancestors with the male paternal ancestors, but also their respective wives. The Āp, M. P.[^1060] has mantras referring to the three male paternal ancestors as well as their wives. The Sān. gr. (IV. 1.11) provides that behind the lumps for the paternal ancestors the performer places the lumps for their wives, putting something between the two sets of piṇḍas and the commentator explains that darbhas are placed between the two sets. The Kauśikasūtra (88.12) also provides for the offering of piṇḍas to the wives of male ancestors to the south of the piṇḍas for male ancestors. The Āśv. gr. (II. 5. 4-5), while speaking of the Anvaṣṭakya rite, refers to piṇḍas to be offered to the wives of ancestors with the addition of rum and the scum of boiled rice. The Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra IV. 7 (after describing the Piṇḍapitṛyajña in IV.5-6) notes that the difference between it and the ordinary monthly śrāddha is that in the latter piṇḍas are offered to the wives of the pitṛs[^1061]. Dr. Caland (in 'Ahnencult' p. 164) thinks that this inclusion of the women ancestors among those to whom piṇḍas were to be offered was made by taking over from Anvaṣṭakya ceremonial described above. This conjecture does not look very probable. The Aṣṭakā rites existed from remote antiquity as shown above.

## Participation of females in piṇḍas offered

If the offering of piṇḍas to women ancestors were borrowed from the Anvaṣṭakya this item would have figured in all sūtras just as Aṣṭakāśraddha does. It is rather more probable that the extension to women was a natural growth in course of time. Some of the smṛtis emphasize the participation of the wives of paternal ancestors in the _pārvaṇaśrāddha_ offerings. Satatapa states[^1062] : "In what is offered to the pitṛs after Sapiņdikaraṇa, the mother is a participant everywhere. A śrāddha may be separately offered to the mother in the Anvaṣṭakā rites, in Vṛddhi-śrāddha, at Gayā and on the anniversary of the day of her death; but in other cases it is performed along with the husband'. It is stated by Bṛhaspati that the mother partakes of the śrāddha food along with her husband (i.e. the father of the performer); that the same rule applies to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother[^1063]. The Kalpataru[^1064] and others held that the wives of the paternal ancestors were not _devatās_ in the pārvaņa-śrāddha, but they only enjoyed the ethereal food which came to the pitṛs, while Hemādri and other southern writers held that the mother and other female ancestors were among the devatās of pārvaņa-śrāddha, but not the stepmother. There was a divergence of views whether the words 'mother', 'paternal grandmother' and 'paternal great-grand-mother' included the co-wives(_sapatnis_) of these, Hemadri (on śrāddha pp. 97-104) has a long disquisition on this question. According to one view the step-mother, the co-wife of the _pitamahi_ and the co-wife of the _prapitāmahi_ would be included in the presentation formula (as quoted below), while according to Hemādri only the real mother, the real paternal grand-mother and the real paternal great-grandmother would ordinarily be included except on rare occasions such as a Mahālayaśrāddha or a śrāddha at Gayā[^1065].

As regards the mantra to be recited when offering each of the piṇḍas there is some divergence of views, which reaches far into antiquity. The piṇḍa[^1066] is offered to each ancestor after stating his gotra, his relationship to the performer and name (all in the vocative). According to several writers the form of the presentation of the piṇḍa is 'this is for thee, O Father! N.N. (by name) and so and so by gotra.' In the Tai. S. I. 8.5 1, in the Ap. M. P. II. 20.13 and in some sutras, the following is added 'and for those who follow thee' (ye ca tvām-anu)[^1067]. In the Gobhila-gṛhya IV. 3.6 and Khādiragṛhya the formula is still longer 'This piṇḍa is thine, O father! and of those who follow thee and of those whom thou followest. [^1068] To thee, Svadha!'. The Bhāradvaja[^1069] gr. II. 12 introduces slight changes.

## Mantras at offering piṇḍas

It has been already noted above (n. 781) how the Sat. Br. disapproves of the usage of the Tai.s. in this matter, the reason being[^1070] that when the son offers a piṇḍa to his father and employs the formula 'this is thine and of those that follow thee', he would be included among those that follow the father and be thus offering a piṇḍa to himself, which is inauspicious. It is provided by Gobhila-gṛhya[^1071] that if he does not know the names of his ancestors he should put down the first piṇḍa with the Formula 'svadhā to the Fathers dwelling on the earth', (he should put down) the 2nd piṇḍa with the formula 'svadhā to the fathers dwelling in the air', the third with the formula ‘svadha to the Fathers dwelling in heaven' and should recite in a low voice the words 'Here, O Fathers, gladden yourselves, show your vigour each according to his own part.' Yama quoted by Kalpataru (on Sr. p. 203), following Gobhila provides generally (whether the ancestors be known or not) that the first piṇḍa should be offered to the father with the expression 'pṛthivi', the second to the grandfather in the aerial regions and the third to the paternal great-grandfather with the mantra 'dyaur darvi'. The Viṣṇu Dh.S. (73.17-19) has similar provisions, the mantras respectively being 'pṛthivi darvirakṣita', 'antarikṣam darvirakṣita,' dyaur-darvirakṣita'. Medhatithi on Manu III. 194 says (following ASv. Sr. and others) that if the names of the ancestors are not known he should simply say “O Father, Grandfather' &c. If the gotra be not known then he should employ the gotra name Kaśyapa[^1072].

Compare तै. सं. I. 8.5.1 एतत्ते तत... प्रपितामह ये च त्वामन्यत्र पितरो यथाभागं मन्दध्वम् ' and वाज. सं. II. 31 'अत्र पितरो मादयध्वं यथाभागमावृषायध्वम्।. The आश्व. श्री. सू. II.6.24 says 'नामान्यविद्वांस्ततपितामह प्रपितामहेति'.

[^1072]: गोत्राज्ञानेप्याह व्याघ्रपादः-गोत्रनाशे तु कश्यपः-इति । गोत्राज्ञाने कश्यप गोत्रग्रहणं कर्तव्यम् । कश्यपसगोत्रस्य सर्वसाधारणत्वात् । तथा च स्मृत्तिः । तस्मादाहुः सर्वाः प्रजाः काश्यप्य इति । स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 481); vide श्रा.प्र. p. 260 for a similar provision. The शूद्रकमलाकर p. 49 says: यद्यपि तस्मादाहुः सर्वाः प्रजाः काश्यप्य इति शतपथश्रुतेः ... कश्यप गोत्रमस्ति तथापि श्राद्ध एव तत् ।। 'सर्वाः प्रजाः काश्यप्य:' These words occur in शतपथबाह्मण VII 5.1.5.

Certain matters pertaining to piṇḍas must be stated in one place once for all. There is a good deal of discussion about the
size of the piṇḍas. Marici (quoted by Aparārka p. 507) provides that in pārvaņa-śrāddha the piṇḍa should be of the size of undried _āmalaka_ fruit, of the size of a _bilva_ fruit in Ekoddiṣṭa, - in navaśrāddhas the piṇḍa should be bigger than in any one of the preceding when offered every day during the days of impurity on death. The Skandapurāņa says that piṇḍas should be of such a size as would enable a calf two years old to put it easily into its mouth[^1073]. Angiras (q. by Sm. C. p. 475 and Hemādri, śrāddha p. 1429) prescribes that the piṇḍas may be of the size of _kapittha_ or _bilva_ fruit or of the size of a hen's egg or of an _āmalaka_ or _badara_ fruit. In the Maitrāyaṇīya-sūtra[^1074] it is said that the piṇḍa for the paternal grandfather should be bigger than that for the father and should be in the middle (of the three piṇḍas), that the piṇḍa for the great-grandfather should be the largest of all. The next point is from what materials the piṇḍas were to be made. If piṇḍas were offered before _agnaukaraṇa_ they were to be made from the boiled rice (caru) prepared for agnaukaraṇa. If made after _agnaukaraṇa_, the piṇḍas were to be made from the cooked food (remaining after agnaukaraṇa) mixed with sesamum (vide Yāj. I. 242). If piṇḍas were to be offered after the brāhmaṇas took their dinner, the piṇḍas were to be made from the remainder of the food cooked for the brāhmaṇas which was to be mixed with the boiled rice for agnaukaraña as stated in Kātyāyana's Śrāddhasūtra[^1075]. The piṇḍas were to be placed according to the Matsya[^1076] on darbhas spread on the ground cleaned with water mixed with cow's dung and urine. There were others such as Devala, the Brahmapurāņa and Bhaviṣyapurāṇa that prescribed that an altar, either circular or square, of sand was to be raised on ground 4 fingers in height and one cubit in extent near the plates from which brāhmaṇas were to eat and thereon _darbhas_ were to be placed and then piṇḍas.

## Placing of piṇḍas

The Vāyupurāņa provides that a line should be drawn on the altar or the ground with the root of a _darbha_ to the accompaniment of the following mantras viz.[^1077] 'I destroy whatever is impure; I have killed all _asuras_, _dānavas_, rakṣasas, yakṣas, piśācas(goblins), _guhyakas_ and yātudhānas' and the mantra 'struck down are the asuras and rakṣasas sitting on the Vedi)'. In Ap. Sr. I. 10.2, Manu III. 217, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 73.17-19, Yama (q. by Hemadri p. 1440), the Kalpataru ( on Sr. p. 203), Mahārṇavaprakāśa (q. by Hemādri), Hemādri ( Śr. pp. 1440-42 ) and Sr. P. pp. 266-267 reference is made to adoration of the six seasons and the obeisance (_namaskāra_) to the pitṛs in the words 'namo vah pitaro' (Vaj. S. II. 32)[^1078] and the repetition of three mantras when each of the three piṇḍas is offered, some holding that the seasons were to be deemed as identified with '_rasa_', _śoṣa_' and four other words (in Vaj. S. II. 32), while others held that the adoration of the seasons is quite distinct from the namaskāras to the pitṛs. In the śaunakātharvanaśrāddha-kalpa, the piṇḍas are offered in the reverse order i.e. first to the great-grand father, then to the grandfather and then to the father (Hemādri on śrāddha p. 1442). Ap. Sr. I. 9. 4 refers to this method in 'pitāmahaprabhrtin vā'.

[^1077]: निहन्मि सर्वे यदमेध्यवद्भवेद्धताश्च सर्वेऽसुरदानवा मया। रक्षांसि यक्षाश्च पिशाच सङ्घा हता मया यातुधानाश्च सर्वे ॥ अनेन मन्त्रेण सुसंयतात्मा वेदीं च सर्वां सकृदुल्लिखेच्च ॥ ब्रह्मपुराण q..by कल्पतरु (श्रा.) p. 214,216, श्रा. प्र. p.251. This is cited as from ब्रह्माण्डपुराण by अपरार्क p.478 ( which reads सुसंयतात्मा तिलान् क्षिपददिक्ष तथा विदिक्षु). The verses are वायुपुराण 75.45-46 and are mentioned as from वायुपुराण in श्राद्धतत्त्व p. 235. Both अपरार्क and श्रा. प्र. add the vedic mantra 'अपहताः'। (वाज. सं. II. 29) here.

[^1078]: पूर्वपिण्डं प्रयच्छेत्तु पित्र्यं च पृथिवीति च । पितामहाय त्वपरमन्तरिक्षे च दापयेत् ॥ प्रपितामहाय च ततस्तृतीयं तु निवेदयेत् ॥ द्यौर्दर्विरिति मन्त्रेण श्रुतिरेषा सनातनी॥ यम q. by कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 203), हेमाद्रि (श्रा. p. 1440). उच्छिष्टसंनिधौ दक्षिणाग्रेषु दर्भेषु पृथिवी दर्विरक्षिता इत्येकं पिण्डं पित्रे निदध्यात् । अन्तरिक्षं दर्विरक्षिता इति द्वितीयं पितामहाय । द्यौर्दर्विरक्षिता इति तृतीयं प्रपितामहाय। विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 73. 17-19. आचम्योदक् परावृत्य त्रिरायम्य शनैरसून् । षडृतूंश्च नमस्कुर्यात् पितॄनेव च मन्त्रवित् ॥ मनु III. 217. The मन्त्र is : पृथिवी दर्विरक्षिता तृप्तिः स्वधानुपदस्ता तां पृथिवी दर्विमक्षितां तृप्तिं स्वधामनु पदस्तामग्निरिव पृथिवीमुपजीवासौ ये चात्र त्वामन्वेषा ते स्वधा. In the other two mantras in honour of पितामह and प्रपितामह substitute अन्तरिक्षं and द्यौः for पृथिवी, वायुः and सूर्यः for आग्निः wherever necessary. The meaning is 'the earth is a ladle giving inexhaustible gratification' &c. The काठकगृह्य (63. 14) provides 'पृथिवी दर्विरिति निपरणं कुर्यात्' and the कौशिकसूत्र (88.8-10) also mentions the three mantras uttered at the time of offering the three piṇḍas (viz. पृथिवी दर्विरक्षिता, अन्तरिक्षं दर्विरक्षिता, द्यौ दर्विरक्षिता). Compare काठकसंहिता IX.23.

About the final disposal (_pratipatti_) of the piṇḍas several views were entertained. We have already seen (note 780 ) that the Vāj. S. and several sūtras provided that the middle one of the three piṇḍas for paternal ancestors was to be eaten by the wife of the performer of the śrāddha if she was desirous of a son. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that the _dharmapatni_ (i.e, a wife of the same varṇa and married before any other wife ) should eat the middle piṇḍa with the mantra 'ādhatta pitaro garbham' (q. in n. 780) and then she gives birth to a son who lives long, secures fame, is intelligent and obtains wealth and progeny and who is of a good and righteous turn of mind. The same rule is provided for by the Laghu-Ašvalāyana 23.83, the Kūrma II. 2. 71, 76, Matsya 16,52, Vāyu 76,31, Viṣṇudharmottara I. 1718, 220, 149, Padma (sṛṣṭikhaṇḍa 9.121) and other purāņas. As regards piṇḍas in general, the Āśv. Sr. (11. 7. 14-17) says that the other two piṇḍas (except the middle one ) should be cast into water or in fire or they may be eaten by a brāhmaṇa who has suddenly developed a distaste for food or they may be partaken by one who has been suffering from a serious disease (such as tuberculosis or leprosy ) and that in the latter case the man either recovers or dies. The Gobhila-gr. (IV. 3, 31-34) provides that the piṇḍas should be thrown into water or in fire or should be given to a brāhmaṇa or a cow to eat. Manu (III. 260-261 ) says the same and adds that they may be given to a goat for eating and that some allow them to be devoured by birds. Yāj. I. 257, Matsya 16.52-53, and Padma[^1079] mention the same five ways of disposal but the last adds one more viz. placing them near a mound of earth. The Varahapurāņa[^1080] (190.121 ) says that the performer may eat the first piṇḍa himself, he should give the middle to his wife and the third he should cast into water. The Anušāsanaparva (125.25.26) provides that the first and the third should be thrown into water or fire and the middle piṇḍa should be eaten by the wife. It is provided by Bṛhaspati that if the wife is suffering from a disease or is already pregnant or is staying in some other place, then an old bull or a goat may eat the middle piṇḍa (quoted by Sm. C. on Sr. p. 486, Kalpataru on Śr. p. 224).

[^1079]: पिण्डांश्व गोजविप्रेभ्यो दद्यादग्नौ जलेपि वा। वप्रान्ते वाथ विकिरेदापोभिरथ वाहयेत् ॥ पद्म (सृष्टि 9. 120); अपरार्क p. 550 and हेमाद्रि read विप्रान्ते and वयोभिरथ वाशयेत् (p. 1504). That birds should be allowed to eat the piṇḍas is natural since it was believed as stated above (p. 339) that the pitṛs wander about in the form of birds. Vide कूर्म II. 22.83 for a similar verse.

[^1080]: भक्षयेत् प्रथमं पिण्डं पत्न्यै देयं तु मध्यमम्। तृतीयमुदके दद्याछ्राद्धे एवं विधि: स्मृतः॥ वराहपुराण 190.121.

The Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 141, 8) prescribes that when a śrāddha is performed at a _tirtha_, the piṇḍas should be cast into the sacred water. The Anušāsanaparva 125. 38-40 and some of the purāṇas such as Vāyu (76.32-34 ) and Brahma (220.150–152) provide that certain consequences follow from the disposal of piṇḍas in one way or another viz. the best worlds by giving piṇḍas to cows, intellect and fame from casting into water, long life from offering them to birds &c. Vide also Brahmāṇḍa (upodghāta, chap. 12. 31-35) which provides that if given to cows the result is best complexion, if to cocks then delicacy. long life if given crows. In this connection it should be noted that piṇḍas of rice or of flour were not to be offered in all śrāddhas. The Śrāddha-kalpalatā (pp. 86-89 ) has a long discussion about the śrāddhas in which the offering of piṇḍas of food is forbidden. For example, it quotes Pulastya to the effect that in śrāddhas performed on the two _ayana_ days, on the two equinoctial days, on any sankrānti, no piṇḍas are to be offered, so also in śrāddhas on Ekādaśi, Trayodaśi, on Maghā and Krttikā nakşatras, if a man desires to have sons and wealth.

On the question as to what is the principal item in the śrāddha there are three views. Some, like Govindaraja[^1081], hold that feeding of brāhmaṇas is the principal thing and they rely on Manu III. 129 which says 'One may feed even a single learned brāhmaṇa in a rite for gods and manes and not many who do not know vedic mantras; by doing so he reaps abundant reward'. Here the reward or fruit is associated with feeding a learned brāhmaṇa. There is a maxim[^1082] of the Pürvamimāṁsā that whatever is mentioned in proximity with an action that has a reward or fruit but has no special reward of its own, is subsidiary (_anga_) to what is declared to have a reward.' Besides, there is no piṇḍadāna in certain śrāddhas such as āmaśrāddha, śrāddha on the Yugādi days[^1083].

[^1081]: पुष्कलं फलमाप्नोतीत्यभिधानात् बाह्मणस्य भोजनमत्र प्रधानं पिण्डदानादि त्वङ्गमित्यवसीयते । गोविन्दराज on मनु III. 129 (Mandlik's ed.). कुल्लूक on the same verse refers to this opinion.

[^1082]: The न्याय is फलवत्संनिधावफलं तदङ्गम् mentioned by शबर on जे. IV. 4. 19 and by शङ्कर on वेदान्तसूत्र II, 1. 14. Vide जै. IV. 4. 29–38.

[^1083]: तथा च पुलस्त्यः । अयनद्वितये श्राद्धं विषुवद्द्वितये तथा । युगादिषु च सर्वासु पिण्ड्निर्वपणादृते ॥ इति । कर्तव्यमिति शेषः । स्मृतिच. (श्रा.) p. 369; vide हेमाद्रि (श्रा.)  pp.334-336.

Others like Karka hold the view that piṇḍadāna is the principal item in śrāddha. They rely upon the fact that in the śrāddha at Gayā it is the offering of piṇḍas that is the most important matter and upon the fact that in the Viṣṇudharmasūtra (78. 52-53, and 85. 65-66) and in several Purāṇas such as the Varāha (13.50), Viṣṇu (III. 14.22-23), Brahma (220.31-32), Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 145.3-4) the pitṛs are stated to have expressed a deep yearning for a son who would offer them piṇḍas at Gayā and water on sacred rivers &c. (vide note 911). Further support is sought for this view in the fact that in the śrāddha on the birth of a son and in śrāddha offered even by a good Śūdra the feeding of brāhmaṇas is forbidden, A third view is that both the feeding of brāhmaṇas and the offering of piṇḍas are the principal matters in a śrāddha. The Gobhila-smṛti, after stating[^1084] the other two views and some of the reasons therefor, tells us that the author of it is himself in favour of this third view. In cases where the word śrāddha is employed and there is neither brāhmaṇa feeding nor piṇḍadāna as in Daiva śrāddha, the word śrāddha is applied in a secondary sense (_gauṇa_). Vide Hemādri (śraddha) pp. 157-160. In the Dharmapradipa it is said that among the followers of the Yajurveda (i.e. Vājasaneyins) the offering of piṇḍas is principal, among the followers of the Ṛgveda the feeding of brāhmaṇas is principal, while among the followers of the Sāmaveda both are principal. In this way śrāddha partakes of two characters viz. it is a _yāga_ (sacrifice) and also[^1085] a gift (dāna). Haradatta, Hemādri, Kapardi and others appear to hold that all three (bhojaṇa piṇḍadāna and agnaukaraṇa) are principal. Vide Samskāraratnamālā p. 1003.

The Matsyapurāṇa says in a famous passage 'ancestors from the fourth (i.e. the father, grand-father and great-grand father of the great-grandfather of performer ) are entitled only to the wipings of the articles of food (sticking to the hand of the performer of śrāddha);

[^1084]: प्राधान्यं पिण्डदानस्य केचिदाहुर्मनीषिणः। गयादौ पिण्डमात्रं तु दीयमाननिदर्शनात्॥ भोजनस्य प्रधानत्वं वदन्त्यन्ये महर्षयः। ब्राह्मणानां परीक्षायां महायज्ञे प्रदर्शनात् । आमश्राद्धविधानस्य विना पिण्डैः क्रियाविधिः । तदालभ्याप्यनध्यायविधानश्रवणादपि ॥ विद्वन्मतमुपादाय ममाप्येतद्धृदि स्थितम्। प्राधान्यमुभयोर्यस्मात्तस्मादेष समुच्चयः॥ गोभिलस्मृति III. 160-163.

[^1085]: धर्मप्रदीपेपि। यजुषां पिण्डदानं तु बह्वृचानां द्विजार्चनम्। श्राद्धशब्दाभिधेयं । स्यादुभयं सामवेदिनाम् ॥ तञ्च पितृन्यजेत पितृभ्यो दद्यादित्युभयप्रयोगदर्शनाद्यागदानोभयात्मकम् । निर्णयसिन्धु III. उत्तरार्ध p. 372.

## Persons that are lepabhājaḥ

the father, (the grand-father and great-grandfather) are entitled to the piṇḍa; the offerer of the piṇḍa is the 7th; thus _sapiṇḍa_ relationship extends to seven generations[^1086]. The Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa states that three ancestors beginning from the paternal grandfather of the paternal grandfather enjoy the wipings (of the hand of the performer when he offers piṇḍas)[^1087]. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 84-86) has similar verses. Manu provided[^1088] that the performer should place three piṇḍas on _darbhas_ and then wipe off from his hand the particles of food and water sticking to it with the roots of the darbhas (on which the piṇḍas were placed) and that such wipings are meant for those who are called 'lepabhāgin' (the three paternal ancestors after the paternal great-grand-father). Similar provisions are made by the Viṣņu Dh. S. 73.22, Varāhapurāņa 14,36, Garudapurāņa (Acārakānda 218.24), Kūrma II. 22.52. Medhātithi on Manu III. 216 says that even if no food or water sticks to the hand still the performer rubs the hand against the roots of the darbhas on which the first piṇḍa was placed. A special rule was provided by Devala quoted in Śrāddhakalpalatā (p. 14) that if the father or mother became a _mleccha_ (by forcible or voluntary conversion &c.) one should not observe any impurity for him or her and no śrāddha should be offered and when offering the three piṇḍas in place of the father the name of Viṣņu should be uttered.

[^1086]: लेपभाजश्चतुर्थाद्याः पित्राद्याः पिण्डभागिनः। पिण्डदः सप्तमस्तेषां सापिण्ड्यं साप्तपौरुषम्॥ मत्स्य  18.29. These very verses occur in पद्मपुराण (सृष्टिखण्ड 10. 34-35), which reads सपिण्डाः सप्त पूरुषाः. They are quoted from मत्स्यपुराण by अपरार्क p. 507, मत्स्य 16.38 is तेषु दर्भेषु तं हस्तं निमृज्याल्लेपभागिनाम् । .

[^1088]: न्युप्य पिण्डांस्ततरतांस्तु प्रयतो विधिपूर्वकम् । तेषु दर्भेषु तं हस्तं निमृज्याल्लेप भागिनाम्॥ मनु  III. 216. The latter half occurs in मत्स्य 16.38.

One question that exercised the minds of well-known writers was whether the daily _Vaišvadeva_ should be performed before starting the śrāddha ceremonies or after the latter were finished. We have to remember first that several works state that rites for pitṛs deserve pre-eminence over those for the gods[^1089]. Manu (III. 265 ) states[^1090] that after the brāhmaṇas have been dismissed the performer of śrāddha shall offer the (daily) domestic _bali_ offering and that this is the settled rule of dharma. Medhātithi explains that the word 'bali' is merely illustrative. The Matsyapurāņa[^1091] 17.61, the Varāhapurāṇa (14.43), Skanda VII. 1. 266. 101-102, Devala, Kārṣṇājini and others provide that after the rites for the fathers are finished Vaisvadeva should be performed. When Vaišvadeva is performed after the completion of śrāddha rites, it is to be offered from the food that remains after being utilized for the śrāddha dinner. But Hemādri (pp. 1058-1065) holds a long discussion and arrives at the following conclusions. In the case of an _āhitāgni_ (p. 1064), Vaišvadeva is to be performed before śrāddha except in the case of the śrāddha on the 11th day after death. In the case of one who has not kept the sacred fires there are three optional times for Vaišvadeva, viz. after agnau karaṇa or after the vikira (scattering of food on darbhas for those dying without the _saṁskāras_ being performed for them), or after the brāhmaṇas are dismissed on the completion of the śrāddha (p. 1064). If Vaišvadeva is to be performed before śrāddha or in the midst of it, then the cooking of food must be done separately for Vaišvadeva and for śrāddha. In the case of all, whether _sāgnika_ or _anagnika_, Vaišvadeva must be performed with the remainder of the food left after use in śrāddha, if the former is performed after the latter. There were sages like Paithīnasi[^1092] that held that Vaišvadeva should not be performed with the food cooked for śrāddha without first offering the food to the brāhmaṇas invited for srādda dinner i.e. Vaišvadeva must be performed after śrāddha if the same food is to be used for the former.

The Nirṇayasindhu (III. p. 459 ) states that as most smṛtis place the performance of Vaišvadeva after śrāddha and as many writers of commentaries and digests such as Medhātithi and Smṛtiratnāvali do the same all should perform Vaišvadeva after finishing śrāddha.

## Modern Pārvaṇaśrāddha

It is now necessary to illustrate how _pārvaṇa_ śrāddha is performed in modern times. Here the greatest variety prevails. The details of the rite vary in the different parts of India. They vary also according as the performer belongs to a particular Veda or a particular recension of the Veda, they vary according to the particular eminent writer that is followed and further additions are made according as the performer is a Vaiṣṇava or a Śaiva. Such differences have to be passed over here, particularly because they are not material. We saw above that the Pārvaṇa-śrāddha was very simple in the days of the Brāhmaṇas and most of the sūtras. There was then no express mention of the worship of Viśvedevāḥ in Pārvaṇa śrāddha, or of the maternal ancestors or of the wives of any ancestors. Gradually these came to be added and by the time of the Yājñavalkyasmṛti there was special invocation of the Viśvedevāḥ. But these latter were probably not expressly divided into groups at the time of that work. During the smṛti period groups of Viśvedevāḥ came to be assigned to different kinds of śrāddhas (vide p. 457 note 1018). The Purāṇas prescribed several Paurānic mantras for being recited during the śrāddha rite, such as the verse 'āgacchantu' (note 984) and the verse 'devatābhyaḥ pitṛbhyaśca' (p. 458 note 1020). Then there arose the principle of the Pūrvamiṃāmsā that all rites described in the different śākhās and sūtras constitute but one rite, and that one may take over from another śākhā or sūtra details described therein, which are not opposed to one's own śākhā or sutra (vide pp. 453-55 notes 1011-1013). This principle tended to make the śrāddha rites all inclusive and the whole procedure became swollen to an enormous extent. How even the slightest variation causes difference in the details may be illustrated by an example. In Mithilā villages even among poor men eleven brāhmaṇas are invited for pārvapa-śrāddha, but it is often difficult to secure a very learned man (who is called _pātra_ or _mahāpātra_) to officiate. In such a case where a _mahāpātra_ or a _pātra_ brāhmaṇa is not available the śrāddha be called apātraka-pārvaṇaśrāddha (for which really there is no _śastric_ authority) and is distinguished from the _sapātraka_ pārvaṇa śrāddha in several matters, two of which in the case of the Vājasaneyins may be stated here. Though the Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana, which is of special authority among Vājasaneyins, declares (at the end of kaṇḍikā III) that the brāhmaṇas are to be dismissed at the end of the śrāddha with the verse 'Vāje vāje' (Vāj. S. 9.18) and the performer should circumambulate the brāhmaṇas with the mantra 'ā mā vājasya' (Vaj. S. 9. 19), it is not the practice among the śiṣṭas in Mithilā according to the editor of the Śrāddharatna to observe these directions in what is called 'apătraka-pārvaṇa-śrāddha' in these days. In Rudradhara's Śrāddhaviveka (pp. 138-146) the 'apātraka pārvaṇa-śrāddha-prayoga' is set out at length.

In medieval and modern times in the different provinces of India different manuals are followed by the followers of the several Vedas. For example, in Bengal the Sāmavedins, Yajurvedins and Ṛgvedins follow the procedure of pārvaṇa śrāddha laid down in the manuals (or _paddhatis_) of Bhavadeva, Paśupati and Kālesi respectively and there are many persons who follow the rules laid down by Raghunandana in his Śrāddhatattva and Yajurvediśrāddha-tattva In Mithilā, Śrīdatta wrote his Pitr̥bhakti for Yajurvedins and the Śrāddhakalpa for Sāmavedins and the Śrāddha-ratna of Mahāmahopādhyāya Laksmīpati (between 1500 to 1640 A. D.) which is printed at Darbhanga and claims to be the traditional manual for Maithilas (Maithila-sāmpradāyika-śrāddhapaddhati) in several places says that it follows the Sugatisopāna of Pratihastaka for Chandogas and also for Vājasaneyins. In the Madras State Vaiṣṇava brāhmaṇas follow special treatises on _Pūrva_ and _Apara kriyās_ of Vaidika-Sārvabhauma or Harita Venkatācārya or Tolappar and Smārta brāhmaņas follow the Smr̥timuktāphala of Vaidyanātha, which does not much differ in major matters from the works of Vaidikasārvabhauma. Often the only differences are in the sankalpa and at the end. It is impossible to exhibit in this work the contents of all these manuals and to compare and contrast them. Therefore I shall set out here a model pārvaṇaśrāddha rite as performed by R̥gvedins in Western India and then a Śukla Yajurveda rite. The Pratisāṁvatsarika śrāddha[^1093] rite for Ṛgvedins in Western India may be set out as follows:-(From the references added in the text and notes it will be clear that this modern rite is all inclusive i.e. it follows the Āśv. Śr. often taking passages verbatim from it, the smṛtis and purāṇas). The performer wears white garments (lower and upper ) and sits on a seat of _kuśas_ or of wool or deer skin and then sips water twice and wears a _pavitra_ on the finger next to the small finger with Ṛg. IX. 83.1. He ties his top knot on the head and sacred thread with kušas, and ties three kuša blades with tilas on the left of the _dhoti_ worn by him. Then he performs prāņāyāma and declares the resolve (_saṅkalpa_)[^1094] to perform (the Sāṁvatsarika) śrāddha after referring to the time and place and together with agnaukaraṇa, piṇḍadāna &c. The invited brāhmaṇas reply 'do so'. Then the performer puts into a copper vessel water with the mantra 'imam me Gange' (Ṛg. X. 75.5), sandalwood paste with the mantra 'Gandhadvārām', yava grains with the mantra 'thou art yava, king of cereals, Varuņa is thy patron, thou art endowed with sweetness, thou art the remover of all sins and art known by all sages as holy , betelnut (with Ṛg. X. 97,15), gold (or some coin) with the mantra 'Hiraṇya rūpaḥ' (Ṛg. II. 35.10 ), flowers and basil leaves. (Then he becomes prācīnāvīti )[^1095] and puts sesamum grains in the water (in another vessel) with the mantra 'Tilosi' (quoted in note 966 ), Bhr̥ṅgarāja leaf with the mantra 'mā kākam' (Ṛg. VI. 48. 17), betelnut, gold (or coin). Then he repeats the Puruṣa-sūkta[^1096] (Ṛg. X. 90), Ṛg. X. 128.1-9, IX, 58,1-4, Ṛg. X. 126.1-8, Ṛg. IV. 40.5, Ṛg. VII. 89.5, the sacred Gāyatri with _om_ and the three Vyāhr̥tis, Ṛg. VII. 56. 12, Ṛg. VIII, 44.21, 17, Ṛg. VIII. 95. 7-9. Then after repeating the well-known verse 'apavitraḥ pavitro vā'[^1097] (whoever, whether pure or impure or being in any state whatever, remembers the name of Viṣṇu becomes pure externally as well as internally ), he requests 'May everything such as the place and the materials be rendered pure'. The brāhmaṇas reply 'let it be so.' Then placing some coin on the ground, the performer having in his hand sesamum grains, water and kūšas goes round (pradaksiņā) the brāhmaṇas thrice, and repeats three verses (in classical sanskrit) in praise of the dust of the feet of brāhmaṇas and a Vedic passage from Tai. Ā. II. 15[^1098] "All the devatās reside in a brāhmaṇa who knows the Veda; therefore every day one should perform obeisance to brāhmaṇas knowing the Veda. He should not utter anything derogatory or evil (either true or false) about them. (By doing so) he pleases all these _devatās_'. After making obeisance (to the brāhmaṇas) twice he should be prācīnāviti, repeat the verse ‘akrodhanaiḥ' (note 913 p. 407 above) and request the brāhmaṇas 'may you be pleased to say that I have complete _adhikāra_ to perform the sāmvatsarikaśrāddha of my pitṛs this day'. The brāhmaṇas should reply 'let there be this adhikāra for the performance of śrāddha.' Then being _upavitin_ the performer requests ‘may you declare that this time is the proper time and that the food cooked is fit for being offered.' The brāhmaṇas reply 'let it be so.' Then he asks the permission to give invitation to the brāhmaṇas. They give it. Then he touches the right knee of one brāhmaṇa and says "you should find time to accept the invitation to act as representing the Viśve-devas named Purūrava and Ārdrava in this pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitr̥s'. The brāhmaṇa replies 'yes, be it so.' Then the performer addresses the second Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇa in the same way (if two brāhmaṇas have been invited for the purpose) and then wearing the sacred thread in the prācīnāvita way should touch the left knee of the brāhmaṇa (_pitṛya_) and say to him 'you should accept the invitation to represent my father, grandfather and great-grandfather in this pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha,' The brāhmaṇa should reply 'so be it.' He should request you should repair to my house. The brāhmaṇa replies 'I shall do so.' Then he should make maṇḍalas[^1099] for the daiva and pitṛya brāhmaṇas. Then _savyam_. The performer should offer seat, sandalwood paste, flowers and say 'may all the items (_upacāras_) of showing honour be complete by means of _yava_ grains.' Then _apasavyam_. He offers _āsana_ (seat), sandalwood paste and flowers and declares 'may all the _upacāras_ be completed by means of sesamum grains.' Then _savyam_. He offers welcome to the _daiva_ brāhmaṇas, to which they respond by saying 'susvāgatam' (it is a good welcome). Then he should say 'here is _pādya_ for you, O Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava! Bhūr-bhuvaḥ-syaḥ to the (daiva) brāhmaṇa'; the response is 'supādyam'. He should wash the feet of (the _daiva_ ) brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas with the mantra 'śan no devir' (Ṛg.X. 9.4, vide n. 968). Then he wears the thread in the _apasavya_ way and offers welcome to the pitṛya brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas representing the three male ancestors[^1100] and offers to give _pādya_ to them and they respond with the words 'susvāgatam' and 'supādyam'. He also employs the verse 'śan no devir' as in the case of _daiva_ brāhmaṇas.

Then the performer casts away the _pavitra_ worn so far, washes his hands and feet, performs _ācamana_ and wears two pavitras. Then _savyam_. He says 'welcome to all.' They respond with 'susvāgatam'. Then holding the right hand (except the thumb) of the daiva brāhmaṇas he says "Ye gods, occupy seats '; they respond by saying 'susamāsmahe' (we have well occupied them). Then _apasavyam_. He addresses similar words to pitṛya brāhmaṇas who respond in a similar way. Then _savyam_. He seeks permission in the words 'I shall perform the Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitṛs that has been begun'. The brāhmaṇas say 'do so'. Then the verse 'śam no devir' (Ṛg. X. 9.4) is repeated and also the words 'thou art yava, separate from us those who hate us and who are our enemies'. Then _apasavyam_. The following texts are repeated viz. Ṛg. X. 9.4, Ṛg. X. 15.1 and with the mantra 'The asuras, rākşasas, the piśācas, that dwell along the earth are struck down; may they go from this place elsewhere wherever their mind may be fixed', he scatters sesamum grains everywhere and repeats the mantra, Ṛg. X, 87.1 There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras and twelve Ādityas. Let there be protection given by Viṣṇu at the door where śrāddha is being performed and may this spot be Gayā. The brāhmaṇas reply 'Let it be a good spot.' Then _savyam_. He sprinkles drops of water with darbhas over the food that is cooked for the śrāddha dinner with the mantras viz. Ṛg. IX. 58, 1, IX. 67.26-28 and with the three Vyāhr̥tis and the Gāyatri. Then he requests 'May there be purity of the cooking' and 'may the sprinkling of the cooked food be according to the rules prescribed,' to which the response is ‘so be it.' Then the verse 'āgacchantu mahābhāgāḥ' (vide note 984) is recited and the brāhmaṇas reply 'we are careful (or attentive).' Then _apasavyam_. He announces 'contemplating upon this spot where śrāddha is being performed as Gayā and concentrating the mind on Gadādhara (Viṣṇu) and the pitṛs in the form of Vasus and the like, the śrāddha (rite) proceeds'. The brāhmaṇas say 'do proceed.' Then _savyam_. He gives water on the hand of the _daiva_ brāhmaṇas, places on the right side of the seat occupied by them two darbhas together with yavas with his upturned right hand held by the left hand and says with the Vyāhr̥tis (Bhür, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ) 'this is the seat for the brāhmaṇa representing the Viśve devas called Purürava and Ārdrava'. The brāhmaṇa replies 'svāsanam'. This is done also for the second daiva brāhmaṇa. He then says 'Please sit down here, though art Dharma' and seizing the brāhmaṇa's hand (except the thumb) he says 'accept the invitation for being daiva brāhmaṇa in the Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha.' The response is 'so be it.' Then reaching the _arghya_ water, he sprinkles the ground in front of the (daiva) brāhmaṇas with water, spreads two darbhas (in front of each _daiva_ brāhmaṇa) with their tops towards the east, places down two vessels with theit tout turned downwards, sprinkles water over them with the Gāyatri mantra, raises the vessels up (i.e. turns their tops upwards), again sprinkles water over them and places over them (the two Vessels) two kūrcas[^1101] with the tips turned to the east, pours into them water and invokes the water once with the mantra, 'śan no devir' ( Ṛg. X. 9. 4). Then he puts yava grains into the two _arghya_ vessels for daiva brāhmaṇas with the mantra 'Yavosi dhānyarājo vā' (note 985 ) and also sandalwood paste, flowers, basil leaf and performs obeisance. He says "May all the upacāras be completed by means of yavas; the two arghya vessels for daiva brāhmaṇas are fully ready'. The response is 'susampanne'. He says 'svāhā, these are arghya waters'. The response is 'let there be arghya waters'. Placing his left hand in which he holds kuśas and yava grains on the right knee of the daiva brāhmaṇa and holding in his (right) hand yava grains he says ‘I shall invoke the Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava to be present in you'. They respond' do invoke'. He invokes the Viśve-devas with the mantra 'viśve devāsa' (Ṛg. II. 47.13) separately repeated as regards each _daiva_ brāhmaṇa. He says, 'I invoke the Viśve devas with the mantra 'visve devāḥ śr̥ṇutemām' (Ṛg. VI. 52.13). Having invoked Viśve devas he casts the remaining yaya grains on the ground near the feet of the daiva brāhmaṇas. Then he gives water to them (daiva brāhmaṇas) and he puts in their hands the darbhas placed over the _arghya_ vessels; he says 'O Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava! this is arghya water for you; svāhā, adoration. They respond let there be arghya'. Repeating the mantra 'yā divyā āpaḥ' (vide āsv. Gr. IV.7.13 above in n. 966 ) he says 'this arghya has been offered, it is no longer mine.' They respond 'let it be so offered'. The same process is followed as to the second daiva brāhmaṇa. Then he offers fragrant[^1102] substances (sandalwood paste etc.), flowers, basil leaves, incense, lamp, and cash according to his ability as substitute for garment, _gopicandana_ for unguent, sacred chord and two kuša blades for pavitra with the words 'O Viśve devāḥ, called Purūraya and Ārdrava! these are fragrant substances for you according to your portions; svāhā, adoration'. When offering a garment or cash therefor he recites 'yuvā suvāsāḥ' (Ṛg. III. 8.4). Then he says 'these items viz. _gandha_, leaves, flowers, incense, lamp ending with covering (garment) be all of them complete. Let there be good worship in the rite of worship; May that which is wanting or is excessive be according to prescribed rules'. The brāhmaṇas respond 'astu vidhivat' and the performer recites the verse 'I do obeisance to Acyuta by remembering whom or by uttering whose name whatever is wanting in _tapas_ (observances) or sacrifices becomes at once perfect'.

Then he says to the pitṛya brāhmaṇas 'with your permission I shall offer worship to the pitṛs'. They reply 'do offer.' Then _apasavyam_. After bending his right knee, the performer says 'Bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ to Brahman, this is the seat for my father, grandfather and great-grandfather, named N, N., whose gotra is so and so and who are identical with Vasu, Rudra and Āditya'. So saying he offers double-folded darbhas with sesamum grains to the pitṛya brāhmaṇas who reply 'svāsanam'. Then follows the same procedure as regards pitṛya brāhmaṇas which has been already set out as to daiva brāhmaṇas. The only difference is that instead of two darbhas three darbhas are spread on the ground with their tips towards the south, three vessels are placed towards south-east with faces down wards and three double-folded darbhas are placed on each of the three vessels, instead of 'yavosi' the mantra is 'tilosi somadevatyaḥ' (vide note 966) and instead of 'svāhā namaḥ' the words "svadhā namaḥ' are employed, and instead of _tulasi_ leaf bhr̥ṅgarāja leaf is employed. In _āvāhana_ the performer places his left hand holding kuśas and sesame on the left knee of the pitṛya brāhmaṇa and the verse repeated is 'uśantas tvā' (Ṛg. X. 16. 12) as to each pitṛya brāhmaṇa and he should honour the pitṛs by repeating one mantra 'āyantu naḥ' (Vāj. S. 19. 58). He offers _arghya_[^1103] water with the right hand supported by the left to the father and the other two paternal ancestors. Ho brings together the saṁsravas[^1104] in the first pitṛya vessel and anoints his face with that water if he desires a son. The brāhmaṇas respond 'may you have a son'.

The performer becomes प्राचीनावीती when repeating the words अस्मत्पितृ...स्वरूपाणां and reverts to उपवीत form when saying एतेषां etc. Among the Mādhvas the सङ्कल्प contains the words 'पित्रन्तर्यामिणो विश्वेदेवान्तर्यामिणोऽनिरुद्ध-प्रद्यम्न-सङ्कर्षण वासुदेव चतुर्मूात्मकश्राद्धस्वामि-श्रीमध्वजनार्दनस्य समाराधनं करिष्ये।'

[^1095]: The terms प्राचीनावीती, यज्ञोपवीतिन् or उपवीतिन्, सव्यं and अपसव्यं occur almost at every step in the श्राद्धप्रयोग. They will be explained once for all here and instead of repeating lengthy translations the original Sanskrit words will be kept in the _prayoga_ set out hereafter. Gobhila gr. I. 2.2-3, Khadiragr I. 1. 4-6 and Manu II. 63 define yajñopavītin or upavitin as one who suspends the sacrificial chord round his neck and raises the right arm so as to wear the chord on his left shoulder and prācināvitin as one who raises the left arm and wears the chord on his right shoulder Sxv ya means left. Acc. to लघ्वाश्वलायन I. 91 when the sacred chord hangs down from the left shoulder (and under the right arm) that is said to be 'Savyam' and when the chord hangs down from the right shoulder (and under the left arm) that is अपसव्यम्.

[^1096]: Hardly any sūtra or any single digest prescribes the recital of so many mantras as is done here.

[^1097]: This occurs in the Garudapurāṇa (ācārakāṇḍa) chap. 216.1-2.

[^1098]: यावतीर्वै देवतास्ताः सर्वा वेदविदि ब्राह्मणे वसन्ति तस्माद् ब्राह्मणेभ्यो वेदविदभ्यो दिवे दिवे नमस्कुर्यात् । नाश्लीलं कीर्तयेदेता एव देवताः प्रीणाति । ते. आ. II. 15 (at end).

[^1099]: For maṇḍalas vide above pp. 456-457.

[^1100]: The पाद्य would be offered in the words 'पितः, अमुकशर्मन अमुकगोत्र वसुरूप ब्रह्मणे भूर्भुवः स्वः, इदं ते पाद्यम्'. In the case of the पितामह and प्रपितामह words रुद्ररुप and आदित्यरूप would respectively be substituted for वसुरुप. We have to construe as ब्रह्मणे ते पाद्यम् (अस्तु) and भूर्भुवः स्वः as the mantra accompanying the पाद्य.

[^1101]: कूर्च is a bundle of fifteen darbhas one cubit long having tops of four angulas in length and having a knot two angulas from the bottom part. पञ्चदशदर्भैर्ग्रंथितं चतुरङ्गुलाग्रं द्वयङ्गुलग्रन्थि हस्तमात्रं प्रोक्षणकूर्चम् । वैखानसस्मार्तसूत्र I. 8.

[^1102]: Each of the things is offered with the same formula and as to each there is a response from the brāhmaṇas with 'su' prefixed to eacB article offered. It would be like this  'पुरूरवार्द्रवसंज्ञका विश्वेदेवाः यथा भागशः अमी वो गन्धाः स्वाहा नमः। सुगन्धाः । पुरू...विश्वेदेवा यथा भागशः एष वो दीपः स्वाहा नमः सुदीपः' and so on.

[^1103]: The form will be : अपो दत्त्वा पात्रोपरिस्थदर्भान् विप्रहस्ते दत्त्वा अस्मात्पतरिदं ते अर्घ्यम्। अस्त्वर्घ्यम् । अपसव्यम्। या दिव्या आपः पृथिवी। पित्रे इदमर्ध्ये दत्तं न मम । अस्तु दत्तम् । सव्यम् । पितामहेदं तेऽर्घ्यम्। अस्त्वर्घ्यम् । अपसव्यम् । या दिव्या । पितामहायेदमर्घ्ये दत्तं न मम । and so on for प्रपितामह.

[^1104]: For संस्रव, vide note 1001.

He places the vessel containing _saṁsravas_ with the top upside down on darbhas to the north of the daiva vessel, with the mantra 'thou art a place for the pitřs.' Then _gandha_, flowers with _tulasi_ and bhr̥ngarāja leaves, incense, lamp, garment or cash therefor, gopicandana, sacred chord, betelnut, kuśas for pavitra are offered to the pitṛs and he repeats the verse 'idam pitr̥bhyaḥ' (Ṛg. X. 15. 2). After repeating the verse ‘yat smr̥tyā' (vide above ) there is 'savyam'. The performer says 'with your permission I shall prepare maṇḍalas and place the plates'. The response is 'do so'. On the spot where the plates for daiva brāhmaṇas are to be placed a four-cornered maṇḍala beginning from the south-west to north-east and made with the right hand towards it and on the spot for the plates for pitṛya brāhmaṇas the maṇḍala is circular beginning from north-east to south-west made with the left hand towards it. Then the plates for the diners are to be placed inside those maṇḍalas. Then taking holy ashes (_apasavyam_) he draws a line round the plates for pitṛya brāhmaṇas with the mantra ‘piśanga-bhr̥iṣṭim' (Ṛg. I. 133. 5). Then _savyam_. Then round the plates of the _daiva_ brāhmaṇas he draws lines with the mantras 'rakṣā ṇo' (Ṛg. IV. 3. 14 ) and 'brahma ca' (Ṛg. X. 4. 7) and two more verses ( probably Paurāṇic ) which pray that the mark made with ashes may guard all, just as Viṣṇu protects the worlds. Just as Viṣṇu renders ineffective the eyes of all men of evil sight, so one should make a maṇḍala with ashes and when this is done there is no blemish in sitting in the same row for dining. Then the purification of the hand (right) of the brāhmaṇas is done, beginning with the pitṛya brāhmaṇa first. Then the performer requests 'let me perform _agnaukaraṇa_ with your permission in the hand[^1105] of the (pitṛya ) brāhmaṇa.' The reply is 'do so'. Then _apasavyam_. Taking some cooked food and anointing it with clarified butter and dividing it into parts, having touched the two parts placed towards the south he says 'this for Soma accompanied by the Pitṛs, this for Agni, the carrier of kavya' and having spread the left hand underneath the right hand, having cut off portions from the middle and the part to the east according to the rules for avadānas[^1106] and having poured clarified butter on the food in the vessel and on the food cut off for oblations, he should offer the oblations with the words 'To Soma accompanied by pitṛs, _svadhā_ and adoration; this for Soma with the pitṛs and it is not (now) mine' and 'to Agni the bearer of _Kavya_, _svadhā_ and adoration; this is for Agni Kavyavāhana and not mine.' This is the mode every where.

[^1105]: If there are three brāhmaṇas to represent the three paternal ancestors, then he should say 'in the hands of the brāhmaṇas'. The Nirṇayasindhu (III. Uttarardha p. 440) says that a widower performs _agnaukaraṇa_ in the hand of the daiva brāhmaṇa.

[^1106]: As laid down in Āsv. gr 1. 7. 10-12 the अवदानघर्मs are उपस्तरणं द्विस्त्रिश्चावदानं हविरवदानयोश्च प्रत्यभिधारणम्.

He touches water with the left hand and repeats the following (which is called 'saṁstha-japa' and occurs in ĀŠv. Śr. I. 11.15 ) 'Om ca me...te namaḥ'. Obeisance to Agni. _Svasti_. Then he prays ‘O Kavyavāhana! bestow on me faith, memory, glory, intelligence, learning, intellect, wealth, strength, long life, brilliance, health.' He says "offering has been made on the hand'. The response is 'suhutam'. Then he pours ghee on the vessel containing the food and repeats 'mürdhānam divaḥ' (Ṛg. VI. 7. 1). Then the brāhmaṇas should cast the food on their hands in the vessel over which ghee has been poured and then mutter Trisuparṇa[^1107], the hymns to _anna_ (Ṛg. I. 187. 1-11 and several others) and other hymns, Then certain pauraṇic verses should be repeated, viz. 'Devatābhyaḥ' (note 1020), the verse 'one should always recite at a śrāddha these holy places viz Kurukṣetra, Gayā, Gangā Prabhāsa and Puşkara’, the two verses[^1108] 'saptavyādhā' (note 994a ) and three more verses, one speaking of adoration to pitṛs and the other two praying to Viṣņu and Siva for favours. Then _savyam_. Then he sprinkles water ( prokṣana ) on the food with the Gāyatri mantra. Then bending his right knee he silently spills water. Then holding the plate with the right hand above and the left hand below he utters the mantra 'the earth is thy vessel[^1108a], the heaven is the lid, I sacrifice thee in the brāhmaṇa's mouth. I sacrifice thee in the Prāṇa (breath) and Apāna (breath) of learned brāhmaṇas. Thou art imperishable. Do not perish for these (Fathers ) here and in the next world.' Then he repeats 'ato devā' (Ṛg. I. 22. 16) and 'O Viṣṇu, guard the sacrificial food'.

[^1107]: For Trisuparṇa, vide p. 364 note 862a, The अन्नसूक्तs are Ṛg. I. 187. 1-11, IV. 31.1-3 and several others which the brāhmaṇas are in the habit of reciting in these days.

[^1108]: The meaning of the two verses (in note 994a ) viz. सप्तव्याधाः has been stated above on p. 445.

[^1108a]: For 'Pr̥thivi te pātram' vide note 992.

With the hand turned downwards he thrusts in the food (served in the plate) the root of the thumb of the brāhmaṇa turned downwards and should revolve it (in the food) from right to left. Then touching the plate with his left hand the performer should say 'The Viśve devās called Purūrava and Ārdrava are the deity, this food is the sacrificial offering, this brāhmaṇa serves as _āhavaniya_ fire, this place is Gayā, this brāhmaṇa diner is Gadādhara, this food is Brahma, the golden vessel is the shade of the Akṣayyavata (at Gayā). This food together with the flavouring dishes which is already served (in the plate) and which may be served therein (later), is the sacrificial food offered to the Vißve devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava till this brāhmaṇa is satisfied. Adoration. It is not mine. _Om Tat Sat_. May the food offered at the fourteen spots such as Viṣṇupada at Gayā be inexhaustible!'. So saying he should cast on the ground towards the left side of the plate water mixed with darbhas and yavas. He says 'May Gadādhara (Viṣṇu) of Gayā be pleased'. The brāhmaṇas respond 'May he be pleased'. Then he repeats 'Ye devāso' (Ṛg. I. 139.11). Then he says 'with the permission of the daiva brāhmaṇas I shall present food to the Father and others'. They reply 'do so'. Then _apasavyam_. Then silently sprinkling water round the plate, and touching the plate (of the pitṛya brāhmaṇa) with the left hand above and the right hand below it, he repeats the formula 'pr̥thivi te pātram...loke' (vide p. 444 note 992) and the verse 'idam Viṣṇur' (Ṛg. 1. 22. 17) and say ‘ o Viṣṇu! guard the _kavya_ food,' he should thrust the root of the thumb of the (_pitṛya_) brāhmaṇa in the food (served in the plate) and revolve it from right to left. Then touching the plate (of the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇa) with the left hand he should say the father, grand-father and great-grand father are _devatā_, this food is of the nature of _kavya_, the brāhmaṇa is in place of the _āhavaniya_ fire, this place is Gayā, this dining brāhmaṇa is Gadādhara, this food is Brahma, this silver plate is the shade of the Akşayyavața (at Gayā), svadhā to my father, grandfather and great-grandfather named so and so, of gotra so and so, that are Vasu, Rudra and Āditya respectively, this food with the side dishes that is already served in the plate and that may be served (later) is _kavya_ up till this brāhmaṇa is satiated. Adoration. It is not mine. _Tat Sat_. May the food given at the 14 spots such as Rudrapada at Gayā be inexhaustible. May Gadādhara of Gayā be pleased. The brāhmaṇa replies ‘May he be pleased.' He then repeats the verse 'ye ceha pitaro' (Ṛg. X. 15, 13) and says 'May the food intended for the pitṛs please them'. Then _savyam_[^1109]. Then _naivedya_ is offered with the verse 'brahmārpaṇam' (Gitā 4. 24) and with three more verses in which Hari is said to be giver and the enjoyer and the food as having both natures viz, those of _pitṛs_ and _devas_ and ultimately he winds up by saying 'tat sat brahmārpaṇamastu'. Then _apasavyam_. Then two verses are repeated in which adoration is offered to the feet of Siva, Viṣņu, Brahmā and other gods, in which even remembrance of Gayā-kşetra is highly eulogised. Adoration to Kāśi Viśveśvara! adoration to Viṣņu and Gadādhara at Gayā! Then _savyam_. Then he says 'I shall repeat in your hearing the _madhumati_ verses beginning with 'madhu vātā' (Ṛg. I. 90. 6-8). Then he repeats the word 'madhu' thrice. The brāhmaṇas respond 'sumadhu, all food is sweet.' Then _apasavyam_. Then a verse in praise of Vişņu (eko Viṣṇur &c.) 'there is one great Being viz. Viṣņu &c.' is recited and the performer says 'May Janārdana Viṣņu who has assumed the form of my father, grandfather and great-grandfather be pleased by this feeding of brāhmaṇas at the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitr̥s'. The response is ‘may he be so pleased'. _Tat sat brahmārpaṇam-astu_. Then having given water to the brāhmaṇas for _apośana_[^1109a] (then _savyam_) he says 'partake of (the food) at your pleasure' and 'though art the first layer of nectar'. Then he repeats the mantra[^1110] 'fixing myself in faith and in Prāņa I offer nectar; being beneficent enter me without burning me. Svāhā to Prāṇa'. This is repeated as to Apāna, Vyāna, Udāna, Samāna with the substitution of each of these four remaining life-breaths. Then he winds up 'my soul is in Brahma for the sake of immortality' and then 'svāhā to Brahma'. Then the hands are purified (by washing them with water).

[^1109]: The printed text is पितृभ्यः सङ्कल्पितः प्रीयताम्. This makes hardly any sense. I take that what is intended is पितृन सङ्कल्पितमन्नं प्रीणयतु or पितरः सङ्कल्पितेन (अन्नेन ) प्रीयन्ताम्.

[^1109a]: 'Apošana' literally means 'taking or drinking water'. It is a technical term applied to the sipping of water before beginning a meal with the words 'amṛtopastaraṇamasi' and after the eating is finished with the words 'amṛtāpidhāṇamasi'. Vide Tai. Ā. X. 32, Āp, M. P. II.10.3-4. Āśv. gr 1.24.12, Yaj. 1.31 and 106.

[^1110]: The mantras are श्रद्धायां प्राणे निविष्टोऽमृतं जुहोमि शिवो माविशाप्रदाहाय। प्राणाय स्वाहा । श्रद्धायामपाने निविष्टो and so on. प्राणे निविष्टोऽमृतं जुहोमि ब्रह्मणि म आत्मामृतत्वाय -is आप.म.पा. II. 20.26. The whole passage from प्राणे निविष्टो to अमृतत्वाय occurs in ते. आ. X.34.

After muttering the Gāyatri verse ten times or three times, he repeats the hymn to Śraddhā (Ṛg.X. 151. 1-5). Then the performer requests 'you should ask for what is wanted; seating yourself you should with minds at ease eat at your pleasure. You should take from the foods and vegetables that are cooked and are ready whatever pleases you and should discard what you do not like. You should eat at ease'. They respond 'we partake (of the food)'. He says 'I shall recite the hymns called Rākṣoghna[^1111] as far as I can.' They respond 'repeat'. Then towards the end of the dinner a little boiled rice with curds (should be served) and nectar-like Ganges water. He says 'everything is perfect. Ask for whatever you like out of the sacrificial food that is cooked'. They respond 'we have had enough'. He says 'I shall recite the Madhumati verses (Ṛg. I. 90.6-8) in your hearing'. They respond 'recite them' Then _apasavyam_. He recites Ṛg. 1.82.2[^1111a] and should say 'The śrāddha called so and so is completed'. They "should respond '_susampannam_'. Then _savyam_. He asks 'Ye Viśvedevāḥ! are you satisfied ?' They reply 'we are satisfied'. Then _apasavyam_. He asks 'Ye (brāhmaṇas) representing my father, grandfather and great-grandfather! are you satisfied ?'. They reply 'We are satisfied'. He asks 'what is to be done with the food that remains ?'. They reply 'it may be eaten in the company of your friends (and relatives)'. Then _savyam_.

Then the performer declares that he would perform in the Prati-sāṁvatsarika-śrāddha _piṇḍapradāna_ (the offering of lumps of rice ) together with water and sesamum grains. They reply 'do so'. 'Let food be given to those who take as their share what remains outside the plates of the brāhmaṇa diners'. The performer says[^1112] ‘May all the (deceased) men and women slaves that were born in the performer's household obtain satisfaction by the food given by me on the ground'. (Then he offers water to the brāhmaṇas with the words ) 'thou art the nectarial lid' (or covering). He says "May the water given to those who hanker for it, who dwell in Padma and Arbuda and Raurava (hells) full of pus reach them inexhaustibly'. Then _apasavyam_.

[^1111]: The hymn beginning with कृणुष्व पाजः (Ṛg. IV. 4, 1-15) is called राक्षोघ्न. The first five verses of it are वाज.सं. 13. 9-13. All fifteen verses occur in तै.सं. I. 2. 14. 1-6. So also are Ṛg. X. 87 (beginning with रक्षोहणं वाजिनमाजिघर्मि), Ṛg. VII, 104 (beginning with इन्द्रासोमा तपतं रक्ष उब्जतं), Ṛg. X. 118, Ṛg. X. 162.

[^1111a]: अक्षन्नमीमदन्त ह्यव प्रिया अधूषत...हरी॥ This is ऋ. I. 82.2) वाज.सं III. 51, तै.सं. I. 8.5.2.

[^1112]: Compare मनु III.246, which is the same as विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 81.23, मत्स्य 17.57, पद्मपुराण (सृष्टिखण्ड 9. 186).

He repeats the mantra[^1113] 'The asuras and rākṣasas that sit on the altar are struck and driven away' (Vāj. S. II. 29). Sprinkling the ground with water and strewing thereon darbhas cut with one stroke that have their tips turned towards the south-east he says[^1114] 'May the Fathers wash themselves, may the grandfathers wash themselves, may the great grandfathers wash themselves'. In the same way he should sprinkle on the kuśa grass water mixed with sesamum grains for the mothers and the rest. Then he says 'This (food) is for thee, my father named so and so, of such and such gotra, who is (to be contemplated) as Vasu and for those who come here after thee; this is the piṇḍa for thee[^1115], svāhā! This piṇḍa occupying the position of a piṇḍa offered at Gayā is presented to my father named so and so and of such and such gotra and who is in the place of Vasu, it is (now ) not mine'. Similar formulas are repeated for the piṇḍa offered to the grandfather (who is styled 'Rudrarūpa' instead of 'Vasurūpa') and to the great-grandfather (who is styled 'Ādityarūpa'). Then he utters '_Tat sat_.' 'May whatever is offered in Gayā at the fourteen spots such as Viṣṇupada be inexhaustible'. Then he wipes off on the roots of[^1116] the darbhas on which the piṇḍas are placed the particles (of rice, ghee and water ) sticking to his hand for the, gratification of those that are entitled to the wipings. Having uttered[^1117] once over the piṇḍas the mantra 'O fathers; regale yourselves here, come as bulls each to his share', he should turn towards the north with the left side of his body, and having held his breath according to his ability he should return to the original position and utter the words 'the Fathers regaled themselves and came like bulls, each to his share' and having smelt the remains of the boiled rice from which piṇḍas are made from the left side (to the right ) he should cast the piṇḍas (on the darbhas ) and should partake of the boiled rice by taking in as much steam and flavour out of it as he can by smelling it.

[^1113]: He draws with the roots of darbhas as many lines (as the number of piṇḍas offered, 3 or 6) repeating this mantra at each S. II. 29).

[^1114]: This is taken from आश्व.श्रौ.सू. II. 6. 14-15 'मेक्षणेनानुप्रहृत्य प्राचीनावीती लेखां त्रिरुदकेनोपनयेत् शुन्धन्तां पितरः ... प्रपितामहा इति। तस्यां पिण्डान् निपृणीयात् पराचनिपाणिः पित्रे पितामहाय प्रपितामहायैतत्तेऽसौ ये च त्वामत्रान्विति।'. Compare आप.म.पा. II. 20. 4-7 मार्जयन्तां मम पितरो etc. q. in note 1060 above ; vide n 1053 for पराचीनपाणिः.

[^1115]: With the food that remains after अग्नौकरण mixed with honey, sesamum grains and ghee piṇḍas are made by the performer or are got made by his wife and are offered by the पितृतीर्थ. Vide note 962.

[^1116]: For लेपभाजः vide n. 1086 above.

[^1117]: Vide n. 960a for अत्र पितरो मादयध्वं...यध्वम् and अमीमदन्त पितरो...यीषत. The words in the text are taken from आश्व. श्री. सू. II. 6.16-21 on पिण्डपितृयज्ञ 'निपृताननुमन्त्रयेतात्र पितरो माद...यध्वामिति । सव्यावृदुदङावर्त्य यथाशक्त्यप्राणन्नासित्वाभिपर्यावृत्यामीम... यीषतेति । चरोः प्राणभक्षं भक्षयेत्।'.

He should say 'my father! N. N. by name, so and so by gotra, apply unctuous substance'; with these words he should anoint the piṇḍas by means of darbhas with ghee or sesamum oil. And he should apply collyrium to the piṇḍas with the words 'O father! N. N. by name and so and so by gotra apply collyrium'. He should put on the piṇḍas unctuous substance, collyrium and garment[^1118], the last being the fringe of a garment or a tuft of wool with the words 'O fathers ! this is the garment for you, do not take up any other (garment ) than this'. Then _savyam_. He then says 'I shall offer worship to the piṇḍas for the prosperity of my family'. He then offers to the pitṛs present in the piṇḍas _pādya_, _arghya_, water for ācamana, bath, _gandha_, flowers, bhrngarāja leaf, incense, lamp and _naivedya_ of apūpa (cakes) and _pāyasa_ (rice cooked in milk), tāmbūla and dakşiņā, using the word 'svadhā' after each of them. Then he should worship[^1119] them with the mantra 'Fathers! obeisance to you for the sake of food, for strength, for susma, for the non-terrible (_aghora_), for _jīva_, for _rasa_; svadhā to you, O pitṛs, obeisance to you; these are yours, O pitṛs ! these are ours; we are your living (descendants), may we be alive here'! He then recites the verses[^1120] Ṛg. X. 54. 3-5. Having thus worshipped them he then (_apasavyam_) with the palm of the hand turned upwards moves the piṇḍas with the mantra[^1121] 'paretana' which means 'O fathers who love soma drink! Go away by the sombre ancient paths, after bestowing on us wealth and endow us here with auspicious prosperity and all valiant sons'.

[^1118]: Vide आश्व. श्री. सू. II. 7.6 'वासो दद्याद् दशामूर्णास्तुकां वा पञ्चाशद्वर्षताया ऊर्ध्वे स्वं लोम एतद्वः पितरो वासो मा नोतोन्यत् पितरो युग्ध्वमिति'.  The text translated is based on this; when the performer is over 50 years of age he may place on the piṇḍa the hair from his chest.

[^1119]: नमो वः पितर इषे नमो वः पितर ऊर्जे ... सन्तः स्याम-This passage is taken verbatim from आश्व. श्री. सू. II. 7.7.

[^1120]: मनो न्वा हुवामह इति तिसृभिः । आश्व. श्री. सू. II. 7. 8. आप. श्री. सू. I. 10.5 calls them मनस्वती verses, as the word मन: occurs in each of the three.

[^1121]: परेतन-compare तै. सं. I. 8. 5. 2 'परेत पितरः सोम्या गम्भीरैः पथिभिः पूर्व्यैः'।. The 2nd half is different. The आश्व. श्री. सू. II. 7.8 says that he should pour a stream of water with this mantra on the piṇḍas Which represent the Fathers for the time being.

He should repeat thrice the prayer 'O fathers! bestow on us a valiant son '[^1122].Then _savyam_. On the ground near the plates of the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas he scatters food together with yavas and water with the verse 'I shall offer food scattered (_vikira_) near the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas to those gods to whom no soma drink is offered and who are bereft of a share in sacrifices; this scattered food is offered to Viśvedevas who do not partake of the soma drink; it is not (now) mine'. Then _apasavyam_. He says 'I shall offer food scattered near _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas on the ground covered with darbhas to those who died without the _saṁskāras_ being performed for them and to those women of my family who left the family (for bad deeds); this scattered food is presented to those boys and girls that came out of the womb; it is not mine'. So saying he strews food with water and sesamum seeds and then says after reciting Ṛg. X. 15.14 'this piṇḍa made from the remainder of the food and occupying the position that a piṇḍa given at Gayā occupies, has been offered to those persons who were born in my family and died and who were cremated or were not cremated; this is not mine'. So saying he offers near the pitṛya brāhmaṇas a ball of rice and water mixed with sesamum grains.

Then he washes his hands and feet, sips water twice and puts on his finger a _pavitra_ with the mantra 'pavitravantaḥ' (Ṛg. IX. 73. 3). He then requests that the water in the hands of the _daiva_ brāhmaṇas be auspicious (or beneficial). The brāhmaṇas reply 'may the waters be auspicious.' In the same way there are requests for goodwill, for protection due to yavas, for long life, welfare, peace, prosperity, contentment and responses by the daiva brāhmaṇas giving blessings as to these. Then _apasavyam_. Then the same request for auspiciousness of waters, goodwill. protection by sesamum grains &c. and blessings about them by _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas. Then the performer requests 'may my family increase (or prosper) and may the procedure of worshipping the piṇḍas be good,' to which the _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas respond 'may it be so.' Then raising the _pranitā_[^1122a] vessel the performer requests 'May you say that the water and food and the like offered in the Pratisāṁvatsarikaśrāddha to pitṛ, pitāmaha and prapitāmaha, so and so by name and gotra, be inexhaustible.' The _pitṛya_ brāhmaṇas reply 'so be it.' Then _savyam_.

[^1122]: वीरं मे दत्त पितरः-If the wife desires a son then with this mantra the middle piṇḍa is given over to her and she eats it with the mantra आधत्त पितरो गर्भम्. Vide note 780 for that mantra. The आश्व.श्रौ.सू II.7.12-13 says' वीरं मे दत्त पितर इति पिण्डानां मध्यमम् । पत्नी प्राशयेदाधत्त .. सदिति ।'.

[^1122a]: For प्रणीतापात्र vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 208, 1022-23.

The same request is made to the _daiva_ brāhmaṇas and the reply is the same. Then gold is given to the daiva brāhmaṇas and silver to pitṛya brāhmaṇas and the performer says 'may the daksiṇās (fees) given to the brāhmaṇas that ate the śrāddha dinner protect (me).' They reply 'may they do so.' Then he says 'I shall request you to utter the word _svadhā_!' They reply 'do so.' Then _apasavyam_. Then he says "May (the brāhmaṇas representing) father, grandfather and great-grandfather utter the word svadhā,' They reply let there be svadhā.' Then he should place over the piṇḍas sesamum grains and water. Then he says ‘May you declare that svadhā be accomplished.' They reply 'may svadhā be accomplished.' Then _savyam_. Then he says 'may you say that the gods led by Agni be pleased.' They reply 'may the Viśvedevāḥ be pleased.' Then _apasavyam_. Then he requests ‘May you declare that the pitṛs led by the Vasus be pleased'. They reply 'may the pitṛs be pleased.' _Savyam_. He says 'May you declare that there is accomplishment of the sankalpa' (made at the beginning of the rite). They reply 'May there be accomplishment of the sankalpa'. He asks were the vegetables and cooked food liked by the pitṛs'. They reply they were most excellent'. Then the performer decks himself by applying sandal paste to his forehead. After doing obeisance to the piṇḍas he requests for blessings for his family (which are the same as those set out above from the Padmapurāna on p.452 above) and one more blessing 'May persons beg of us but may we not beg of any one' (vide n. 998). The brāhmaṇas reply in the same words only employing the words 'you' or 'your' for 'us' or 'our '.

He says "I shall remove the piṇḍas'. They reply 'do remove'. Then he repeats the verses 'Tad Viṣṇoḥ' (Ṛg. I. 22.20 ), 'Tad viprāso' (Ṛg. I. 22.21 ) and two more verses and then a Paurānic verse enumerating the seven holy cities of Ayodhyā, Mathurā, Māyā, Kaśi, Kāñci, Avantika and Dvārakā. He says "May there be peace, prosperity and contentment on the spot where the piṇḍas are'. They reply 'these (peace &c.) dwell in their own places'. He says 'I shall remove the plates in which the brāhmaṇas had their dinner.' Then he lays aside the _kūrca_. He then recites the verse 'Vāje vāje' (Ṛg. VII, 38,8). Then _savyam_. Then he says 'O pitṛs, get up together with the devas' and repeats the verses 'ā mā vājasya' (Vāj. S. 9. 19), 'svādusansadah' (Ṛg. VI. 75. 9), 'brāhmanāsah pitarah' (Ṛg. VI, 75. 10), 'ihaiva stam' (Ṛg. X. 85. 42). Then he recites 'may the grand fathers being pleased grant to men (their descendants ) long life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, _mokşa_, happiness and kingdom' (Yāj. I. 270, but reads 'prayacchantu' for 'prayacchanti'). Then he prays 'May these blessings turn out to be true, may my family prosper, may this Pratisāinvatsarikaśrāddha have the same fruits as that of a śrāddha performed at Gayā! May the pitṛs secure inexhaustible gratification.' Then he proceeds 'Today my birth has had its reward by bowing to your feet &c.' (vide n. 999 for the two verses repeated here ). The brāhmaṇas reply 'we forget the trouble and excuse you.' Then he says 'Today this tithi is like a day sacred to the sun; the brāhmaṇas invited are like Vyāsa, Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva; may you declare that whatever is lacking as regards seats, dinner, mantras, procedure, materials and fees in this pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitṛs performed by me today become all perfect at the words of brāhmaṇas'. They reply 'May all be perfect'. Then he recites the two verses "Vasiṣṭhāsaḥ pitr̥vad' and 'devān vasişṭho' (Ṛg. X. 66. 14-15) and then at the end he repeats the verse containing a salutation (the word 'namaḥ') viz. 'idam pitr̥bhyo namo astvadya' (Ṛg. X. 15. 2). Therefore at the end (of a śrāddha rite) one does obeisance to the pitṛs (in the words 'namo vaḥ pitaro &c.'). Therefore they say “should one repeat the pitṛyā verses with āhāva mantra specially recited with each verse or without repeating the āhāva mantra separately with each verse; for it is better not to finish Pitṛyajña quickly. He who separately recites the āhāva with each verse makes the _pitṛyajña_ that is imperfect, complete and therefore one must recite specially employing the āhāva with each verse."[^1123].

[^1123]: The words in the प्रयोग (p. 108a ) are 'इदं पितृभ्यो नमो अस्त्वद्येति नमस्कारवतीमन्ततः शंसति तस्मादन्ततः पितृभ्यो नमस्क्रियते । तदाहुर्व्याहावं पित्र्या शंसेश्त् अव्याहावाँ ३ इति । व्याहावमेव शंसेदसंस्थितं वै पितृयज्ञस्य साध्वसंस्थितं वा एष पितृयज्ञं संस्थापयति यो व्याहावं शंसति तस्माद् व्याहावमेव शंस्तव्यम्।'. The passage इदं पितृभ्यो नमो... up to शंस्तव्यम् is taken verbatim from the ऐतरेयब्राह्मण 13th chapter 13th khaṇḍa (end). The khaṇḍa (13) starts with the question whether the verse 'devānām patnir' (Ṛg. V. 46. 6) or the ṛk verse referring to Rākā should be recited first in the आग्निमारुतशस्त्र in तृतीयसवन. The conclusion reached is that the verse referring to देवपत्नीs should be recited first by the होतृ. In the same context a question is raised whether the Yāmī verse (Ṛg. X, 14,4 'Imam yama prastaram') or the Pitṛyā verses (Ṛg. X. 15.1-3) should be recited first. The conclusion is that the यामी verse should be first recited, then the Kāvya verse (Ṛg. X. 14. 3 'Matali kavyair') and then the pitṛya verses, out of which Ṛg. X. 15.2 (इदं पितृभ्यो नमो अस्त्वद्य) is recited last in which the word नमः occurs. आहाव means the mantra शों३सावो३म, The figure 3 is a sign of the फ्लुत accent. The sign of फ्लुत shows deliberation, आहुः-we have to understand ब्रह्मवादिनः as the subject. Then comes the question whether the आहाव should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitṛyā verses or not. The conclusion is that the आहाव should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitṛyā verses. Apparently it is rather difficult to say why this passage of the ऐतरेयब्राह्मण should occur in this प्रयोग. The only reason appears to be that the ऐ.ब्रा. passage has something to say about पितृs and hence as this is a प्रयोग for पितृs it ts introduced here.

The conclusion is one should repeat each verse with āhāva separately uttered. The performer should follow the brāhmaṇas up to the boundary (of the village). He says 'whatever blemish there may be in _japa_, _tapas_ or śrāddha rite--may all that become free from blemish by the favour of brāhmaṇas. I do adoration to that Acyuta (Viṣṇu) by remembering whom &c. O best of brāhmaṇas! may this śrāddha, even if devoid of mantras, or of some rite or of faith, become perfect by your favour'. Then he concludes 'May Janārdana Vāsudeva who assumes the forms of father, grand-father and great-grand father be pleased by this sacrifice, viz. the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of the pitṛs. This is a sacrifice to the manes. _Tat sat_. May it be dedicated to Brahma.' Then he repeats the verse 'Vaşat te' (Ṛg. VII. 99.7) and then says 'adoration to Viṣṇu (Vişņave namah) thrice and sips water twice. The fruit of offering piṇḍas is stated by Bṛhaspati and Vṛddha-Parāśara as follows: If the pitṛs are in the world of gods they are gratified by the food offered in fire, if they are in the world of pitṛs they are gratified by the dinner to brāhmaṇas and if in hell they are gratified by the balls offered on the ground[^1123a].

[^1123a]: पिण्डदानफलमाह बृहस्पतिः। अग्नौ हुतेन देवस्थाः पितृस्था द्विजतर्पणैः । नरकस्थाश्च तृप्यन्ति पिण्डैर्दत्तैस्त्रिभिर्भुवि ॥ वृद्धपराशरोपि। ये देवलोकं पितृलोकमापुः प्राप्तास्तथैव नरकं नरा ये । अग्नौ हुतेन द्विजभोजनेन तृप्यन्तु पिण्डैर्भुवि ते प्रदत्तैः॥ q.in पृथ्वीचन्द्र folio 110 b.

Comparing the above rather elaborate and exhaustive procedure with the procedure of pratisāmvatsarikaśrāddha as practised in Madras in these days only a few points of differences in detail emerge. In the Madras procedure the numerous mantras as set out above (p. 448) do not occur nor does the Tai. Ā passage occur therein, but the verses in praise of the dust of brāhmaṇa's feet do occur. Most of the mantras both Vedic and Paurāṇic are the same. The blessings (āśirvādas) in the Madras manual are more elaborate and include even the performer's cattle in the blessing of health and long life. In the Madras manual several mantras are set out as 'annasūkta' mantras in the procedure itself. The Madras paddhati adds at the end the well known verse 'kāyena vācā manasendriyairvā'.

The procedure for Yajurvedins of the Mādhyandina Śākhā in Bengal as set out by Raghunandana in his Yajurvedi-śrāddhatattva is entirely based on the 2nd and 3rd kaṇḍikās of the Śrāddha-sūtra of Katyāyana. The Pāryaṇaśrāddha-prayoga in Halāyudha's Brāhmaṇasarvasva closely follows Kātyāyana and I am assured by a careful student of Dharmaśāstra that the procedure of pārvaṇaśrāddha followed by Madhyandinas at Bhatpara in Western Bengal is in strict conformity with the procedure laid down by Raghunandana. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana is translated here with some explanations and additions made by Halāyudha and Raghunandana and the whole text, being not very extensive, is given in the note below[^1124].

## The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana

"The pārvaņa-śrāddha is preceded by the rite for Višvedevas. The procedure follows that of Piṇḍapitṛyajña[^1124a]. In the rites for the pitṛs double-folded darbhas are to be used (while in Vaišvadevika rite straight darbhas are used). Whenever any thing is to be gifted, the performer (in all daiva as well as _pitṛya_ rites ) wears a _pavitra_ and makes the gift sitting. (When questions are to be asked the performer puts the question to the most eminent in the row of diners (to the best daiva brāhmaṇa in daiva rites and to the best pitṛya brāhmaṇa in pitṛya rites) or he may put the question to all (and the reply is given by one or by all). Spreading darbhas on the seats (he makes the brāhmaṇas occupy them), he puts the question 'shall I invoke the Višvedevas (to the daiva brāhmaṇa)'. Being permitted (by the daiva brāhmaṇas) in the words 'do invoke', he invokes the Višvedevas with the mantra[^1125] 'Visve devāsa āgata' (Vāj. S. 7. 34 'Ye All Gods, come, listen to this my call and sit down on this darbha grass'). Then he scatters yavas (in front of the brāhmaṇas), mutters a mantra 'Viśvedevāḥ śruṇutemam' (Vaj. S. 33. 53, 'Ye All Gods, hear this call of mine'). After this _japa_ he asks (the pitṛya brāhmaṇas) 'I shall invoke the pitṛs'. When permitted (by the pitṛya brahmanas) in the words 'do invoke', he invokes them with the mantra 'uśantas tvā' (Vaj. S. 19, 70, 'O Agni! we longing for our fathers place you down' &c.).

[^1124a]: पिण्डपि ... चारः-so the result is: अपराह्नः कालः, श्राद्धकर्तुः प्राचीनावीतिता, दक्षिणाभिमुखता, वामजानुनिपातः, पितृतीर्थ, अप्रादक्षिण्यं, दक्षिणापवर्गता, दर्भाणां दक्षिणाग्रता चेत्यादयः पैतृकाः धर्माः. From this it follows that in वैश्वदेविकब्राह्मणोपचार there are यज्ञोपवीतिता, कर्तुरुदङ्मुखता, दक्षिणजानुनिपातः, दैवतीर्थं, प्रादक्षिण्यं, उदगपवर्गता, प्रागग्रता चेत्यादयो दैविकधर्माः. There are of course a few exceptions to the first part, such as दक्षिणादान, स्तोत्रजप and विप्रविसर्जन.

[^1125]: It may be noted that almost all mantras quoted by Katyāyana are very apt and appropriate for the purposes for which they are to be reward repeated. For reasons of space the full texts and translation of the mantras could not be given here.

Then he scatters (sesamum grains in front of the pitṛya brāhmaṇas) and mutters the mantra 'ā yantu naḥ pitaraḥ' (Vāj. S. 19. 58, ‘May the soma loving pitṛs come to us' &c.). Then he pours water in each of the cups made of a sacrificial tree (such as palāša, udumbara &c.), in which a pavitra is dipped with the mantra 'śan no devir' (Vāj. S. 36. 12, 'May the divine waters be for our happiness' &c.). (He puts yavas in the vessel for daiva rite). He puts in each of the cups sesamum grains with the mantra 'Thou art Tila[^1126] &c.'. He offers on the hands of each of the brāhmaṇas (first daiva and then pitṛya) that wear a pavitra water in a vessel made of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or precious stone or in whatever vessels may be available or in vessels made of bunches of leaves with the mantra 'yā divyā[^1127] āpah &c.'. The water is offered in the words 'O father' N. N. by name, this is _arghya_ for you' (and then to other ancestors ). Having mixed together in the first vessel (meant for the father) the drops of water remaining in the other vessels[^1128] for other ancestors, he puts down on the ground the first vessel face downwards with the words 'thou art a place for the pitṛs'. Then (at this stage) _gandha_[^1129] (sandalwood paste), flowers, incense, lamp and garment are offered to the brāhmaṇas representing the ancestors).

Having taken out in another vessel some food from out of the food already cooked for śrāddha and having anointed it with ghee he (the performer) asks 'I shall perform agnaukaraṇa'. Being permitted by the brāhmaṇas in the words 'do so', he offers into (gr̥hya) fire oblations[^1130] as in Piṇḍapitṛyajña, having served (into all the plates for all the brāhmaņas invited) the food that remains after being offered in fire, he touches with his hands (above and below each plate) and repeats the mantra 'The earth is thy vessel &c.' (notes 992, 1108a). (He keeps some food aside for making piṇḍas later on).

[^1126]: तिलोसि. This mantra occurs in आश्व.गृ.सू. quoted in note 966 above. हलायुध and रघुनन्दन state that यवs are to be scattered with the mantra 'यवोऽसि यवयास्मद् द्वेषो यवयाराती:' (वाज. सं.5.26) and sesamum grains are to be scattered with the mantra अपहता असुरा रक्षांसि वेदिषदः (वाज. सं. 2.29). Vide या. I. 230.

[^1127]: For the मन्त्र ‘या दिव्या etc.' vide note 966 above.

[^1128]: There are six ancestors, three paternal and three maternal and therefore six vessels; drops of water from five vessels are poured into the first vessel. रघुनन्दन adds that the first vessel is covered with the vessel for greatgrandfather and is then put down with top downwards. The ब्राह्मणसर्वस्व explains 'तत्र च पितरस्तिष्ठन्तीति बृहस्पतिः। आवृतास्तत्र तिष्ठन्ति पितरः श्राद्धदेवताः'.

[^1129]: रघुनन्दन adds 'गन्धादीनां द्वन्द्वनिर्देशान्मिलितानामेव तन्त्रेण पित्रादिक मुद्दिश्य उत्सर्गः'.

[^1130]: Both हलायुध and रघुनन्दन state that the two मन्त्रs in अग्नौकरण are 'ओं अग्नये कव्यवाहनाय स्वाहा, ओं सोमाय पितृमते स्वाहा',

Then (having served the food in the plates ) he plunges the thumb of the brāhmaṇas in the food with a řk (Ṛg. I. 22. 17, ‘idam Viṣṇur vicakrame') addressed to Viṣṇu or with a Yajus so addressed ('Viṣṇo kavyamidam rakṣasva'). Then he scatters about (yavas before daiva brāhmaṇas silently and) sesamum grains with the mantra 'apahatā asurā rakṣānsi vedişadaḥ' (Vāj. S. 2. 29). Then he should serve hot food very much liked (by diners or by the departed) or he may serve such food as he can afford. While the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating (the dinner) he should perform _japa_ of the following[^1131], viz, the sacred Gāyatri once or thrice preceded by _om_ and the vyāhrtis, the verses called Rākṣoghni (note 1111 ), mantras addressed to the pitřs (Ṛg. X, 15. 1-13 beginning with 'udiratām-avara ut parāṣaḥ)', Puruṣasūkta (Ṛg. X. 90. 1-16), Apratiratha hymn (Ṛg. X. 103, 1-13 ) beginning with 'āśuḥ śiśānaḥ') and other holy texts. Then finding that the brāhmaņas are satiated with food, he should scatter some food in front of the dining brāhmaṇas, he should give to each brāhmaņa water once (for _apośana_ at the end of dinner). Then he should mutter as before the Gāyatri, the (three) Madhumati verses (Ṛg. I. 90. 6-8) and the word 'madhu' (thrice). Then he asks 'are you satiated'. Being permitted by them in the words 'we are satiated', he makes them give their consent as to the rest of the food, collects together all food in one vessel (in order to make piṇḍas from it); he offers (two sets of three piṇḍas, three for paternal ancestors and three for maternal ancestors) on darbhas near the spot where[^1132] the brāhmaṇas dined and left uneaten food in plates and pours water over the piṇḍas for ablution[^1133].

[^1131]: It may be noted that in Bengal the numerous verses that are prescribed here for japą are apparently not muttered in modern times.

[^1132]:  उच्छिष्टसमीपे गदाधर notes 'ब्राह्मणानामग्रतोऽन्नं प्रकिरेदिति कर्काचार्याः। पङ्क्तिमूर्धन्यस्योत्तरदिग्भागे अरत्निमात्रे विकिरं दद्यादिति हेमाद्रिः'.

[^1133]: एकतोद्धृत्य is grammatically irregular; it should be एकत उद्धृत्य The पिण्डs are offered to paternal ancestors with their wives ( सपत्नीक) and to maternal ancestors with their wives. The formula would be: अमुखगोत्र अस्मात्पितरमुकशर्मन् सपत्नीक वसुरूप एतत्तेऽन्नं स्वधा । इदममुकगोत्रायास्मत्पित्रेऽमुकशर्मणे सपत्नीकाय वसुरूपाय न मम. The same formula with appropriate changes is to be employed for पितामह, प्रपितामह, मातामह etc. Some writers proposed that nine piṇḍas may be offered, three to पितृवर्ग. three to मातृवर्ग and three to मातामहवर्ग. हेमाद्रि ( श्रा. p. 1445 and 1447) provides that a line for मातृवर्ग should be drawn to the west of the one for पितृवर्ग and another line to the west of the one for मातृवर्ग for मातामहवर्ग and पिण्डs should be offered in that order.

Some authors say that piṇḍas are to be offered after the brāhmaṇas perform _ācamana_ at the end of the dinner. After they perform _ācamana_ he gives to the brāhmaṇas water, flowers, _akşatas_ and _akşayyodaka_[^1134]. Then he prays for the following blessings. He prays 'may the pitṛs be not terrible (i.e. be kind) to us'. The brāhmaṇas reply ‘may they be so'. He prays 'May our family prosper'. They reply "may it be so'. He prays 'May donors increase in our family'. They reply 'let it be so'. He prays 'May Vedas and our pro geny prosper'. The reply is 'May they do so'. He says 'May faith not depart from me'; they say "May it not depart'. He says 'May we possess many things that we can donate'. They reply 'so be it'. After receiving these blessings he spreads kušas called _svadhāvācaniya_[^1134a] together with pavitras (on the ground near the piṇḍas or, on the piṇḍas themselves according to Devayājñika and others); he asks (all the brāhmaṇas or the most eminent one) 'shall I request you to utter the word _svadhā_'. Being permitted by them in the words 'May svadhā be recited' he prays "May there be _svadhā_ to the pitṛs, to the grandfathers, to the great-grand-fathers, to the maternal grandfather, maternal great-grandfather and maternal great great-grandfather'. When the brāhmaṇas reply 'May there be svadhā' he sprinkles water over the svadhāvācaniya darbhas with the mantra 'ūrjam vahantir' (Vāj. S. II. 34). Then he turns the vessel top upwards (which had been placed with top downwards) and he should give to the brāhmaṇas dakşiņā according to his ability. He should make the daiva brāhmaṇas repeat 'May all the gods be pleased'. He should then dismiss the brāhmaṇas with the mantra "Vāja vāje' (Vāj. S. 9. 18), he should follow the brāhmaṇas (up to the village boundary ) with the mantra 'ā mā vājasya' (Vāj. S. 9. 19), circumambulate them and then enter his own house.

[^1134]: On अक्षय्योदक, गदाधर explains 'अक्षय्योदकशब्देन दत्तान्नपानादेरानन्त्यप्रार्थनसम्बन्धि जलमाभिधीयते। तच्च पितृब्राह्मणेभ्य एवेति कर्कः। सर्वेभ्यो दद्यादिति स्मृत्यर्थसारे'।

[^1134a]: सपवित्रान् कुशानास्तीर्य-कर्क and गदाधर explain 'सपवित्रान्साग्रानित्यर्थः'.

## Pārvaṇaśrāddha in Bengal

It is to be noted that in the Bengal Manual of Pārvaṇaśrāddha based on the Brāhmaṇasarvasva of Halāyudha and also on Raghunandana's Yajurvedi-śrāddhatattva the following details are added after the piṇḍas are placed on the darbhas and before the dismissal of the brāhmaṇas. He turns towards the north and says 'O pitṛs, regale yourselves here and come like bulls each to his portion.' Then he turns round to his former position and says 'the pitṛs regaled themselves and came like bulls each to his own share.' Then he loosens[^1135] the side of his _dhoti_ which has been tucked up and then folds up his hands (i.e. offers six namaskāras) with the mantra[^1136] 'Namo vaḥ pitaro rasāya' (Vāj. S. I. 32). He smells[^1137] the piṇḍas and gives the middle one to his wife, if she desires a son, with the mantra 'ādhatta' (Vaj. S. II. 33).

From considerations of space the procedure of pārvaņa śrāddha among Hiraṇyakeśins in modern times is passed over here. Moreover, it closely resembles the procedure in Āśv. Gr. set out above, the principal difference being that some of the mantras are different. The Saṁskāraratnamālā of Gopinātha deals with this from p. 985 onwards. But one noticeable feature of this last work is that of making hair-splitting distinctions. On p. 985 it refers to two śrāddhas (other than piṇḍa-pitṛyajña) to be performed on amāvāsyā, viz. _māsi-śrāddha_ and _māsika-śrāddha_, the first being described by the Dharmasutra of Hiraṇyakesin and the second by the Gr̥hyasūtra. Gopinātha further says that māsikaśraddha is the model of the other śrāddhas described in the Gṛhyasūtra and māsiśrāddha is the model of śrāddhas described in the Dharmaśāstras, such as Mahālayaśrāddha or Sāṁvatsarika-śrāddha, that Darśaśrāddha itself is māsi-śrāddha (p. 988) and that māsika-śrāddha may be performed on each _darśa_ or on any one darśa day in a year and that māsi-śrāddha follows immediately after Piṇḍapitṛyajña as laid down by Manu (III. 122) and māsikaśrāddha may be performed after māsi-śrāddha.

S. 2.32) he offers namaskāra to the pitṛs as identified with Agni Kavyavāhana and then prays to the pitṛs to bestow on them a house in the words 'namo vo gr̥hān naḥ pitaro datta' Vaj. S. 2.32).

[^1137]: Vide Manu III, 218 अवजिघ्रेच्च तान् पिण्डान् and note 960 towards the end.

In modern times no one performs māsiśrāddha or māsika-śrāddha strictly in accordance with the ancient rules. Śrāddha is supposed to be performed by feeding a brāhmaṇa and giving him a dakşiņā of a few _annas_. The Śrāddhatattva (Jiv., part 1 p. 254) provides, after quoting Matsya and Bhaviṣya, that, if a person is unable to perform a pārvaṇaśrāddha every month, he should perform one at least thrice a year when the sun is in the zodiacal signs of Kanyā, Kumbha and Vr̥ṣabha and that if he is unable to perform even thrice then he should perform at least once when the sun is in the sign of Kanyā.

## The Dayabhāga theory of spiritual benefit

The two meanings of sapiṇḍa given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga have already been explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and pp. 472-477. The Dāyabhāga propounded the theory that whoever conferred greater spiritual benefit on the deceased by the performance of śrāddhas and the offering of piṇḍas was entitled to be preferred as an heir to the deceased's wealth. The Mit. said that heirship depended on blood relationship and the nearest in blood to the deceased was the preferential heir. But even under the Mit. whoever took the wealth of the deceased was bound to pay his debts (Yaj. II, 51 ) and to offer śrāddha and piṇḍa to him. This subject and the several propositions deduced from the texts have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 734-745.

One thing to be remembered is that in determining the preferential right regard is to be had to the capacity of a person and the efficacy of the piṇḍas when offered. After a person takes the wealth of the deceased, there is no legal machinery to enforce his duty to offer piṇḍas[^1138]. It was argued in _Nalinaksha v. Rajani Kanto_ 35 C. W. N. 726 that, if an heir does not offer piṇḍas or refuses to offer them to his ancestor. he was not entitled under Hindu Law to succeed to him. This argument was repelled by the judges with the remark that there was no authority for such a proposition and that the right to inheritance is based under the Dāyabhāga not on offering piṇḍa but on the capacity to offer it (p. 729). Vide _Gooroo Gobinda Saha v. Anand Lal_ 5 Beng. L. R. 15 (F. B.) and _Digamber v. Motilal_ 9 Cal. 563 (F. B.) for the statement that the principle of spiritual benefit is the sole foundation of the theory of inheritance propounded in the Dāyabhāga.

[^1138]: Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 740 and note 1431.

But in certain later cases such as _Akshayachandra v. Hari Das_ 35 Cal, 721 it was rightly pointed out that spiritual benefit is not always the guiding principle under the Bengal school of law, that the principle of spiritual efficacy as the guiding principle fails in all classes of female relations such as the wife, the daughter and the mother whose rights are really based on special texts and that the reason for inheritance by a re-united coparcener was not spiritual benefit but was based on a _quasi_ contract and affection.

The question about how śrāddha was to be performed if one or more of the three paternal ancestors were alive engaged the thoughts of writers from very ancient times. The Āśv.[^1139] Śr. S. (II. 6. 16-23) first sets out the views of Gāņagāri, Taulvali and Gautama and then refutes them. Gāṇagāri held that out of the three paternal ancestors piṇḍas should be offered to those that were dead and those that were alive should be honoured in person, since the śrāddha rite is meant for pleasing the ancestors; Taulvali opined that piṇḍas should be offered to all the three ancestors, whether living or dead, since in the rite of śrāddha they are only a secondary matter (a detail). Gautama thought that piṇḍas should be offered to dead ancestors, upto three from the father if the latter was living, from the grandfather if he was alive and from the great-grandfather if all the three be living. Āśv. replies; one cannot offer piṇḍas to three ancestors 1110 beyond the father, grand-father or great grandfather, since one has no _adhikāra_ to do so; one cannot offer piṇḍas to an ancestor after whom there is an ancestor (within three degrees) living. One may offer _homa_ into fire to those that are alive. (If all three ancestors are alive ) all the three piṇḍas must be cast into fire or he may not begin the rite at all. The Katyāyana śr.[^1141] sūtra provides that piṇḍas are offered only to deceased ancestors; therefore if a person's father be alive or if there is a deceased ancestor between whom and the performer there is an ancestor that is alive, then one whose father is alive can only perform _homa_ (into fire, but no piṇḍadāna) or he should not undertake at all (the rite of piṇḍa-pitṛyajña or pārvaṇaśrāddha); that Jātākarṇya prescribes that no piṇḍadāna is possible when a living ancestor (father) intervenes between the performer and a deceased ancestor, since a śruti text says 'one does not offer piṇḍas to ancestors that are beyond a living ancestor.' Manu (III. 220-222 ) deals with this question as follows: If the performer's father be alive he should offer piṇḍas to three ancestors beginning from the paternal grand-father or he may request the father to dinner as he would do to a stranger brāhmaṇa and offer piṇḍas to the deceased grand-father and great-grand-father, If the father be dead and the grandfather be alive, he may offer a piṇḍa only to the father and the great-grandfather (i.e. only two piṇḍas) or the grand-father who is alive may be invited to dinner as if he were the stranger brāhmaṇa invited to represent a deceased grand-father or if permitted by the grandfather who is alive he may offer piṇḍas to father, great-grandfather and great great-grandfather.

[^1139]: तस्मै तस्मै य एषां प्रेताः स्युरिति गाणगारिः प्रत्यक्षपितरानर्चयेत् तदर्थत्वात्। सर्वेभ्य एव निपृणीयादिति तौल्वलिः क्रियागुणत्वात् । अपि जीवान्त एव आ त्रिभ्यः प्रेतेभ्य एव निपृणीयादिति गौतमः क्रिया ह्यर्थकारिता। उपायविशेषो जीवमृतानाम् । न परेभ्योऽनधिकारात्। न प्रत्यक्षम्। न जीवेभ्यो निपृणीयात्। न जीवान्तर्हितेभ्यः। जुहुयाजीयेभ्यः। सर्वहुतं सर्वजीविनः॥ आश्व. श्री. II. 6. 16-23.

[^1140]: One can offer piṇḍas only to three ancestors beginning with the father according to Vedic passages quoted in notes 958, 960a above, and Manu IX. 186. So there is no ancient authority to offer piṇḍa to 4th or 5th or 6th ascendant.

[^1141]: प्रेतेभ्यो ददाति। जीवत्पितृकोपि । जीवान्तर्हितेपि। जीवपितृकस्य होमान्तमनार स्भो वा। न व्यवेते जातूकर्ण्यों न जीवन्तमतिददातीति । कात्या. श्रौ. सू. IV. 1 23-27. Vide also शाङ्गायन श्रौ. सू. IV. 4. 12-15 for similar rules.

The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (chap. 75) has several rules of a similar character. Some of the Purāṇas such as Skanda VI 225.24-25, Agni 117,58-59 deal with this matter. Gobhilasmṛti (II. 93 ff) has a long passage on this question, one verse of which is quoted below[^1142]. Many of the commentaries and digests hold divergent views on this subject, viz. the Mit. on Yāj. I. 254, Kalpataru (śr. pp. 240 ff), Śr. K. K. pp. 552-556 and Nirṇayasindhu (III, pp. 499-503 ). It is impossible to reconcile all the views.The Kalpataru (on śr. p. 240) states that there are three alternative courses for him whose father is alive; (1) he should pass over the father that is alive and offer piṇḍas to those three ancestors to whom his father offers piṇḍas: (Manu. III, 220, Viṣņu Dh. S. 75.1); (2) he should simply offer homa into fire as stated in Aśv. Sr. S. quoted above: (3) he should not engage in the rite of piṇḍapitṛyajña or pārvaṇaśrāddha at all (Gobhila-smṛti II. 93). The Nirṇayasindhu says that there are numerous alternatives mentioned by different writers, that they are forbidden in the Kali age and that one view is that a man whose father is alive cannot engage in a pārvaṇaśrāddha and that the real conclusion is that śrāddha may be offered to those to whom the father (of the performer) who is living offers piṇḍas.

## About Pārvaṇaśrāddha by jivatpitṛka

It is clear that one whose father is living should have nothing to do with piṇḍadāna for deceased ancestors. Manu (in latter half of III. 220) allowed an alternative viz. one should feed one's father at a dinner (and honour him with the details of worship such as _gandha_, _dhūpa_, _dipa_) and offer piṇḍas to the deceased grandfather and great-grandfather. When any one or two out of the three paternal ancestors are alive and śrāddha is permitted to a descendant several alternatives become possible by permutation and combination, which are passed over here from considerations of space and utility. But the various views held by different writers as described above show clearly what a firm grip the theory of the supreme benefits to be derived from śrāddhas had on the minds not only of common people but of learned men, who, in spite of the fact that the father was alive and was there to offer piṇḍas to his three ancestors, allowed even the son (whose father was living) to offer piṇḍas to the same three ancestors. The Vişņu Dh. S. extends the procedure about 'jivatpitṛka' to one's mother's paternal ancestors ( changing the mantra where necessary )[^1142a]. Similar rules apply where the performer's mother is alive (Agnipurāṇa 117.60 'evam mātrādikasyāpi tathā mātāmahādike').

It is provided by Gobhilasmṛti (III. 157) that a śruti injunction should be made effective by means of _anukalpa_ (of some substituted procedure) if the primary procedure cannot be carried out[^1143]. If a person cannot secure several brāhmaṇas but can secure only one, he should perform Pārvaṇa-śrāddha in which six piṇḍas are to be offered with a single brāhmaṇa, provided he is _pankti-pāvana_[^1144] (sanctifier of a row of diners) and in such a case, _naivedya_ should be offered in place of the dinner to the _daiva_ brāhmaṇas and the food should be thrown into fire; so says Śaṇkha 14.10.

[^1142a]: मातामहानामप्येवं श्राद्धं कुर्याद्विचक्षणः । मन्त्रोहेण यथान्यायं शेषाणां मन्त्रवर्जितम् ॥ विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 75.8. मन्त्रोहेण-This is to be understood as follows: "'शुन्धन्तां पितरः' इत्यादौ शुन्धन्तां मातामहा इत्यादिपदक्षेपेण । शेषाणां पितृव्यमातुलादीनां मन्त्रवर्जितं आवाहनादिमन्त्रवर्जितं कुर्यादित्यर्थः"। पृथ्वीच. folio 222 a.

[^1144]: भोजयेदथवाप्येकं ब्राह्मणं पङक्तिपावनम्। दैवे कृत्वा तु नैवेद्यं पश्चाद्वह्नौ तु तत्क्षिपेत्॥ शङ्ख 14.10 ; हेमाद्रि ( श्रा. p. 1524) reads पश्चात्तस्य तु निर्वपेत्.

If even a single brāhmaṇa cannot be had for a pārvaṇaśrāddha, then one should prepare with kušas the effigy of brāhmaṇa students (_baṭu_) and the performer should himself ask the questions and give the answers required in pārvaṇaśrāddha[^1145].

When one cannot secure a brāhmaṇa nor materials, or when one is on a journey, or on the birth of a son, or when one's wife is in her monthly illness, one may perform āmaśrāddha (Śrāddha with uncooked grains)[^1146]. This is stated by the Skandapurāṇa VII.1.206.52. Katyayana and Saurapurāṇa. 19.32 have similar verses "a twice-born person should perform āmašrāddha when he is on a journey or is in distress, or if he has no fire for cooking and those who are weak may always perform it." The Madanapārijāta (p. 483) states that one who has the _adhikāra_ for pārvaṇaśrāddha can alone offer āmaśrāddha. Hārīta says that when there is an obstacle in performing a śrāddha, āmaśrāddha is prescribed except in the case of māsika and sāmvatsarika śrāddhas[^1147]. Āmaśrāddha is always prescribed for śūdras. It was further provided that the grains offered in śrāddha should be utilized by the brāhmaṇas for eating the cooked food for themselves and were to be applied for no other purpose (Hemādri, Śr. p. 1527). Vyāsa provides[^1148] that the quantity of grains should be at least two or three or four times as much as the grains required for offering cooked food. Some words employed in the various items such as _āvāhana_[^1149] svadhākāra and dismissal of the brāhmaṇas had to be changed e.g. in āvāhana the verse employed is 'uśantastvā' (Vāj. S. 19.70) which ends with the words 'havişe attave' (which means 'in order to eat the _havis_') the words 'havişe svikartave' would have to be substituted.

## Āmaśrāddha and Hemaśrāddha

Āmaśrāddha is to be performed in the first part of the day, ekoddiṣṭa in the noon, the pārvaṇaśrāddha in the afternoon and vr̥ddhišrāddha in the first part of the day (divided into five )[^1149a].

If even uncooked food grains cannot be offered the performer should perform hemaśrāddha (śrāddha with money ). When the sun passes from one sign of the zodiac into another, in default of food and brāhmaṇas, on a journey, on the birth of a son, in an eclipse, in the case of women and śüdras _hemaśrāddha_ is allowed or when one's wife is in her monthly illness. In āmaśrāddha twice the quantity of grains required in offering cooked food and in hemaśrāddha four times (the price of the grains required for cooked food) has to be offered. If no money can be had the digests prescribe several modes which have already been set out above ( vide p. 425, n. 955).
