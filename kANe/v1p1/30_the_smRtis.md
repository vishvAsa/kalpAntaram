30. The Smrtis The word smști is used in two senses. It is applied to all ancient orthodox non-Vedic works such as Panini's gram mar, to the srauta, grhya and dharma sutras, to the Mahabha. rata, to Manu, Yijnavalkya and others. In a narrower sense smrti and dharmasāstra are synonyms, as Manu says.304. The word smrti occurs in Taittiriya Aranyaka (I. 2). Gautama (Dh. S. I. 2) and Vasistha (Dh. S. I. 4) speak of smrti as one of the sources of Dharma. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 6. 15. 25) employs the word smrti and has in view Gautama's Dharma sutra according to Haradatta. In the Purvamimāṁsā-sutra the word smrti occurs ( vide VI. 8. 23 and XII. 4. 42 ).306 lu the Vedrutusutrus the word smrti is employed in a wide seuse, in one place as relerring even to the sankhya system.308

History of Dharmaśāstra 

In that work the word is used, according to Sankara, with reference to the Mahābhārata or the Manusmrti ( Vedānta sutra II. 3. 47, III. 1. 14, IV. 2. 14 ). 

Manu applies the word Smṛti also to works that are opposed to and beyond the pale of the Veda (on XII. 95 ).307 But the word is used in this work in a narrower sense viz. Smrti means a work that is not opposed to the Veda or that does not treat the Veda as not authoritative and treats of varna, jāti, āśramas and cognate topics. The word Smști occurs in the Mahābharata (Santiparva 85. 10). But the more frequent word is Dharmaśāstra, though Manu (II. 10) says . Smiti is Dharmaśāstra.' On Pān. I. 2. 64308 there is a vārtika 'Dharmaśāstram ca tathā' ( 39 in vol. I. p. 242 of Kiel horn's ed.). Passages in the Mahābhāsya show that Patan 307 The Tantravārtika (p. 196, Ānad. od. ) refers to this gracugat

jali had before him a large smrti literature. Vide I. H. Q. vol. II. pp. 67 ff; I. A. vol. 14. pp. 326-27 ( Kielhorn), I. H. Q. vol. XI. pp. 79-90; Dr. F. W. Thomas Presentation Volume pp. 128-133 on 'Mahabharata verses and very ancient Dharma sūtras and other works' (by the present author). The Maha bhārata is spoken of as Dharmasastra, Arthaśāstra and Kama sāstra (in Adi. 2. 383). The word Dharınaśāstresu or Dhar maśāstrāņi (in the plural) occurs frequently in the great epic ( vide Vanaparva 207. 83, 293. 34, 313. 5; Sānti. 24. 13, 297. 40, Anušāsana 90. 34). The extant Manusmrti also (in III 232) mentions “Dharmaśāstrāni." Dharmaśāstra is a much wider term than Dharmasūtra. The Dharmasūtras are only a few while there are dozens of Dharmaśāstras. Vide p. 21 above for points of difference between Dharnasūtras and Dharnarsāstras. 

It may be stated that Inscriptions from comparatively early times refer to Smṛtis, particularly to the Smrti of Manu. The Valabhi grant of Dhruvasena of Valabhi year 207 (i. e. 525 -6 A. D.) published in 1. A. vol. II. p. 205 qualifies the king as *Manvādi-pranīta-vidhi vidhānā-dharmā.' The Palitana platea of Simhadeva in the year 255 of the Valabhi era (i. e. 574 A. D. in E. I. Vol. XI. pr 16-20 of the Samanta-Mahārāja-Simhā ditya speaks of Varihausa (the father of the ruling chief) as 'one whose intellect was puritieil by plunging into the, waters of the several Sirtis composed by Manu and others. Similarly, in the Paltana plates of Dharasena Il of (Gupta Samviat) 2.32 (i, e. 571 A, D.) in E. I. Vol. XI. pp. 80 at p. 82, we have the striking description of Guhasena ( father of Dharasena as oue in whose case the title 'raju' was significant because he pleased the hearts of his subjects by properly observing the path laid down by all Sinitis (sakala-smrti pranīta-marya-samyak-paripālnna-piraji-hrdaya - ranjanād auvartha-raja -śabilu!). In the Pulibumra pates of the Estern Cāluky: king Jayasimha ! ( 632-663 A. D. ) occur the words 

Bphaspatiriva nayajāo Manuriva vinayajñaḥ, Yudhisthira iva dharmaparāyunalı'(E. I. vol. 15 at p. 256 ). : The same words (i. e. those in E. I. Vol. XI. at p. 82) occur in the Wala plate of Guhasena of Su ,vut 246 ( of the Valabhi er, i. e. 565 A. D.). A much later grant of China mina Ratonpāla of the Vikramt year 1176 (1119 20 AD) ia ( E. I. XI. pp. 304–313 ) speaks of the donee as 'devoted to

Here the Smrti uuthors Yajňavalkya, Kātyāyana, Bhrgu ( meaning probably ·Manu'), Argiras and Mūrkandeya are specially mentionel, besides the six Philosophical systems of Bhatta 

(i.e. Kumirila) and others. 

Smrtis mirrored the beliefs and practices of people and also influenced writers and ordinary people. For example, Dr. Sterubach in Journal of Bharatiya-VidyĀ, Vol. XI. ( 1961 pp. 221 309), shows how the Pancatantra stories are often based on or relate to separate judicial problems of civil aud criminal law as well as procedure, although it does not solve any of the problems raised. The Raghuvamsa (I. 17 ) states that the subjects of Dilipa did not swerve in the least from the beaten path laid down from the days of Manu. In Raghu yamsa XIV. 67 Kālidāsa says that Munu laid down that the Dharma of a king was to safeguard varnas and āśramus ( vide Manusmrti VII. 35). The drama Micchakaţika (Act IX) shows that a Brāhmana guilty of murder was not to be senten ced to death and the judge refers to the dictum of Manu (pro bably Manusmrti VIII. 380 ) to that effect. 

In ancient times the number of smrtis (i. e. works on dharmasastra ) must have been very small. Gautama men tions by name no smrtıkāra except Mauu, though he speks of dharınaśūstras (XI. 19). Baudhiyana names seven (besides himself) authors on dharma, viz. Au pujanghani, Katya, Kāśyapa, Gautama, Prajapati, Mandgalya and Hirita. Vasi stha uaines only tive authors, Gautama, Prajāpati, Manu, Yama and Hārita. Āpastumba meutions a large number, viz. ten, some of whom like Eka, Kuņika and Puskurasādi are no more than mere names to us. Manu speaks of only six ( besi. des himself) viz. Atri, the son of Utathya, Bhrgu, Vasistua, Vaikhāvaga (or ruther Vikhamas ) and Suunaka. But in all these works the writers are mentioned only casually aud there is no regular enumeration or list of writers ou dharma in one place. A parārku quotes (p. 7) a sutra of Gautama (not found in the priuted G. Dh. S.) in which sixteen authors of dharmaśāstras including himself are enumerated. 308 The 309 अत्र गौतमः। स्मृतिर्धर्मशास्त्राणि तेषां प्रणेतारो मनुविष्णुदशातिरोत्रबृहस्पत्यशान,

same sūtra with slight variations is ascribed to Sankha-Lik hita in the Viramitrodaya ( Paribhasa-prakāsa p. 16). Yaj fiavalkya is probably the earliest writer who enumerated in one place ( I. 4-5) twenty expounders of dharma (including himself and counting Sankba and Likhita as two distinct persons ). It will be noticed that Yāj. omits Baudhāyana. Parāśara also gives a list of 19 expounders of dharma (exclu ding himself), but his list differs slightly from that of Yāj. Parīšara omits Brhaspati, Yama and Vyāsa and adds Kās. yapa, Gārgya and Pracetas. The Tantra-vārtika (p. 125 ) of Kumārila 81 enks of eighteen dharmasamhitās. Visvarūpa quotes a verse of Vrddha-Yājñavalkya, who adds ten names to the list of Yājňavalkya (vide note 262 a bove).310 The Catur viņsatimata is a work which professes to give the views of 24 sages on dharmaśāstra, viz. all those listed by Yāj. (except Kātyāyana and Likhita ) and six more, viz. Gārgya, Narada, Baudhāyana, Vatsa, Viśvamitra, Sarkha ( Sānkhyāyana ? ). Aigiras as quoted in the Smaticandrika (I. p. 1), Hemadri ( Danak handu p. 528 ), the Sarasvativilisa (p. 13) and other works mention Upasınrtis,311 There is a smrti called Sattrim sanmata quoted by the Mit., Aparirka and other works. Paithinasi as quoted in the Smyticandrıkā, the Samskāra mayākha and other works enumerates 36 smrtis.313 Apara rka says that the Bhavisyatpurāņa speaks of 36 smṛtis and

his enumeration of them is slightly different from that of Paithinasi.13 The Vrddhagautamasmrti ( Jivananda part II. pp. 498-499 ) gives a list of 57 dharma-śāstras. The Prayo ga-pārijāta as quoted in the Viramitrodaya enumerates 18 principal smrtis, 18 upasmrtis and 21 other smrtikāras.s14 If all the smrtis cited in the later nibundhas such as the Nirnayasindhu, the Mayūkhas of Nilakantha and the Vira mitrodaya be taken into account, the number of smṛtis will be found to be about 100. 

The sinštis thus relied upon are the products of different and widely separated ages. Some of them are entirely in prose or in mixed prose and verse, while the large majority are in verse. A few of them are very ancient and were com posed centuries before the Christian era. Such are the dhar 

masutras of Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhāyana, and the Manusmṛti. Some were composed in the first centuries of the Christian era such as the smṛtis of Yājñavalkya, Parisara, Nāraila. Most of the smṛtis other than the above fall between the period from 400 A. D. to 1000 A. D. The chronology of all these smṛtis presents perplexing problems. Some of the metrical smṛtis are remodellings of older sūtras as in the case of Sankha. There are sometimes as many as two or three

different smṛtis going under the same name, e. g. Sātātapa, Hārīta, Atri. Then the confusion is worse confounded by the fabrications of sectarian zeal, such as the Hārītasmṛti which is full of Vaişņa vite teachings. There are several works going under the naines of well-known smṛtikāras with the prefixes Vrddha, Bșhat, Laghu. In many cases the works going under these names are different from the smrtis that are without these prefixes and this differentiation took place at a very early date in certain cases; for example, so early a writer as Visvarūpa distinguishes between Yājsavalkya and Vpildha-Yājuavalkya, Gārgya and Vțddha-Gārgya. Similarly, Visvarūpa quotes (on Yāj. I. 69 ) Vrddha-Manu and (on Yāj. I. 19 ) Vrddha-Vasistha, which latter probably was different from the Vasisthadharmasūtra, as the latter does not contain the details given by Visvarūpa.815 In some cases the works designated Vrddha or Bṛhat are larger and in all cases later than the works without those prefixes. For exam. Ple, vide Parisara aud Brhat-Parāśara (Jivananda part II. pp. 53-309), Glutaina and Viddha-Gautana (Jivananda Part II. pp. 497-038). Some of the works with the prefix Všddha are versified compilations of prose works e. g. Mit. on Yāj. III. 267 quotes a verse from Vrddha-Visnu which is merely the versified equivalent of Visuu-dharmasūtra chap. 50. 6, 12-14. It appears that sometimes the same work is cited with the prefix Vrddha or Bșhat, e. g. the Mit. on Yāj. II. 135 quotes a passage from Brhad-visnu which is the same as the Vişnudharmasūtra 17. 4-7. 

As most of the writers quote from memory and had recou rse to mss. and not to standard editions, even well-known verses are ascribed to different authors in different works. The verses 'bhrātrnām-aprajāh' &c. which are quoted as Nārada's (Nārada 16. 25-26 ) in the Vyavahāramayukha are attributed to Sarkha in the Madana pārijāta (p. 680). The three verses about bundhus are ascribed to Baudhāyana by Madhava and to Vṛddhaśātāta pa by the Madanapārijāta (p. 674 ). 

In spite of all these drawbacks, an attempt will be made in the following pages to arrange some of the leading versified smṛtis in chronological order beginning from the Manusmṛtit.

All these smṛtis are not equal in authority. Most of them are obscure and are only rarely cited by ancient commenta tors. Exclusive of the dharmasutras hardly a dozen emptis have found commentators. If we are to judge of the authority of a smrti by the commentaries thereon, then the Manusmrti stands pre-eminent. Next to it is the Yājsavalkyasmrti.
