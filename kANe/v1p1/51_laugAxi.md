51. Laugaksi 

Laugākşi is mentioned among the 36 expounders of Dharmaśāstra set out by Paithīnasi (on p. 1 of Smộ. Ch.) and Angiras quoted on the same page includes Laugākşi among Upasmộtis. 

The Mit. (on Yāj. III, 1-2, 260, 289 ) quotes verses of Laugāksi on āśauca and prāyascitta. Aparārka quotes nine proge passages (pp. 28–29, 33, 122, 145, 166, 176 and 530) on Ācāra including Srāddha and ten verses on ten pages on Acāra, Āśauca and the order of forest hermits and one very long prose passage on p. 1227 (covering half a page ). On p. 542 Aparārka quotes a verse of Laugāksi in which Prajāpati is mentioned as an authority. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 118-119 quotes the definitions of Yoga'and Ksema given by Laugākşi and which are declared to be not liable to partition by coparceners ( acc. to Mapu IX. 219 ), even if they be acqui red by detriment to the parental estate. Those definitions of Yoga and Kşema are quoted by many works and writers on Vyavahāra such as the Smộticandrikā (on Vy. p. 277 ), Par. M. Vol. III. p. 563. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. pp. 588-589 for different meanings of the two words. 

It is remarkable that Aparārka quotes from Lauvākši prose and verse passages ten times each. On pp. 1821938, a long prose passage of Laugākşi is quoted about Kūdo mandar homa ( for which see H, of Dh. vol. IV p. 43 n. 102). FOUNDED

Maskarin on Gaut. Dh. S. appears to quote Laugākşi as Lokāksi. On Gaut. 10. 42 ( about the finding of treasure trove) Lokāksi is quoted as "anubhūticibnāni musitvā gļhnataḥ pūrvasāhusam dandah tad-dravya dvigunam ca rājā haret'. Maskarin quotes verses of Lokāksi on Gaut. 14. 1, 15. 1; 22, 18 ( three verses on prāyaścittas for killing a person of pratiloma caste and others also). Kalpataru quotes Laugāksi frequently e. g. on Br. Kānda Laugākşi is quoted five times ( all prose); Kalpao (on Srāddha ) p. 98 defines ' Agredidhuşu and didhisū!
