29. Sumantu For a Dharmasūtra of Sumantu vide Madras Tri. Cat. of Sanskrit M88. (1919-22 ) pp. 5160-62. 

From Viśvarūpa, Haradatta and Aparārka it follows that Sumantu composed a sūtra work on dharma, particularly on ācāra and prāyaścitta. Viśvarūpa quotes prose passages from Sumantu on upapātakas, 390 on prāyaścitta for Brāh mana-murder ( on Yāj. III. 237), for drinking wine ( on Yāj. III. 250 ), for theft of gold (on Yaj. III. 252 ), for incest (on Yāj. III. 253-54 ), for killing a cow and about atatayin (on Yāj. III. 261 ). In one quotation from Sumantu cited by Viśvarūpa the views of ācāryas and of Angirasa are men tioned. 187 The prīyaścittas for Brāhmana-murder and for killing a cow contained in Viśvarūpa occur in Haradatta (on Gaut. 22. 13 and 18). Most of the qnotations cited by Viśva rūpa occur in Aparārka also. The Hāralatā (p. 68 ) quotes sūtras of Sumantu on āśauca. One well-known sutra of Suma ntu is 'no prāyaścitta (or blame ) is incurred by killing an

atatāyin, except cows and brāhmaṇas '. 398 A parārka quotes sūtras from Sumantu condemping marriage with maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter and recommending the abandonment of a young wife in certain circumstances.200 In the Sarasvativilāsa a prose passage of Sumantu is cited on the seven constituents of rājya 300 

Paithinasi includes Sumantu among the thirty-six sages, expounders of Dharmaśāstra. Kalpataru (Br. K. p. 22) enumerates the means of settling (doubts on) points of Dharma viz. Veda, Vedānga, Itibāsa-purāna, Tarka, Mimaṁsā and Dharma-istras and also the practices of families, gana, country, caste and varṇa, and also the usages of heretical sects, of the āśramas and of those learned in the Vedas. On p. 76 of the Br. kānda Sumantu provides that all Brālmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas have to undergo the surixkārıls from Garbhādhana to Vivāha and Yajñas. The Vratakānda ( Kal pao) quotes froin Sunautu numerous verses on Kșirapratipad Vrata (pp. 36-38 ) and on Aśūnyasayana-vrata (pp. 41-44). It is possible that some of the verses ascribed to Sumantu in these cases are the compositions of some Sumantu other than the author of the prose sutras. e. y. the verse 'a householder that does not offer sraddha, when the sun is in Virgo, how can he have wealth and sons' &c. (q. by Aparārka on Yāj. L. 217 p. 424). Kalpataru (on sraddha) pp. 90-91 quotes a long prose passage from Sumantu on persons that are (pārktcya (not fit to dine in the same row with others invited at Srād dha ). Aparārka quotes numerous prose passages of Suma ntu on prāyascitta. A much discussed dictum of Sumantu

(q. by Mit. on Yīj. II. 21 and by Aparārka on p. 1043 on Yāj. III. 227 ) is there is no blame ( or sin ) in killing an atrıtayin, except in the case of a cow or a brāhmana that is āta tāyin ). For a discussion of this dictum vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 148 151 and III. pp. 517-18, and the paper "Ātatāyivadha' by Prof. Rangasvami Aiyangar in C. K. Raja presentation vol. pp. 197-232. The Mit. quotes several prose passages of Suma ntu on Yāj. II. 21, III. 6, 37, 250, 258, 260. 

These quotations from Viśvarūpa and others establish that a prose work on dharma by Sumantu existed early enough. It appears, however, that the work was not a very ancient one. Neither Yājūavalkya nor Parāśara mentions Sumantu among the propounders of ilharma. On the other hand the name of Sumantu is an ancient one. In the Bhaga vatapurāna (XII. 6. 75 and 7.1) Sumantu is said to have been a pupil of Jaimini and a promulgator of the Atharvaveda. Vide Sintiparva 341. 19 for Sumantu and other pupils of Vyāsa and Sabhā 4. 11. In the daily turpuṇķu the name of Sumantu occurs along with Jaimini, Vaiśampāyana, Paila. 

Numerous verses on dharma are also cited from Sumantu by Aparārka, the Smṛticandrikā and other works. This may probably be a different work from the sūtra work of Sumantu. In one verse of Sumantu ( Aparārka on Yāj. I. 223 ) occur the words. Saikhasya vacanam yathā' and in another (Aparārka on Yaj. I. 217–218 ) the Kanyā sign of the zodiac is refer red to. 

It is remarkable that the Mit. and Aparārka contain po verses of Sumantu on vyavalāra. The Sarasvati-vilāsa is rich in quotations from Sumuntu on vyavahāra. A compro mise, exchange or partition, if lair, could be annulled up to the tenth day, but if unfair up to the 9th year ( vide note 293 above). 'If even as much as a mixit went from the buyer to the seller, that would support the sale of the land (sold just as a small dose of poison permeates the whole boily and when no purchase-money is paid or only a portion is paid, then the purchase is called avukrıty6 and is liable to be set aside if the price is not paid in (good time)'.801 Sumantu prescribes a
