32. The Two Epics The two great Epics of India, the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa, contain ( particularly the first) numerous passa ges bearing on meny topics of Dharmaśästra and are relied upon as authorities in medieval and later works. The Mabu bhārata itself claims (in Adiparva, 2. 83) that VyDS composed the work as a great Dharmaśāstra, as Arthasastra ( treatise on politics and Government), Moksasistra and also

Kāmaśāstra.868 In the last parvan it claims that whatever is said in it would be found elsewhere and what is not con tained in it would not be found anywhere else i.e. it claims to be encyclopoedic and hence there was a great incentive to later scholars to add to it fresh matter. In the Udyoga parva (130. 18 ) and in Adi, 62. 20 the Mahābhārata is spoken of as Jaya (jayo námetihäsoyam śrotavyo vijigīsunā ) and in the last pwrvan ( 5.51 ) the epic is also called sumlită (1. 16, 63. 90), Purina ( 1. 17), akhyina (2. 388-389 ), itihisa ( 1. 19 and 26 and 2.36, 41 and 62. 18), itihisottama (in 2.385), Kavya (1. 61 and 73, 2. 390 ), Karsnaveda ( 1. 268 and 62. 18). It further states ( Adi. 1. 52 ) that different beginnings of the epic existed. In the last parvan ( svargarohana ) it states that the epic is so called because of its greatness360 ( great extent) and the weightiness (of its contents ) and that the epic is equal (in importance ) to the 18 Purānas, all the Dharma Šāstras and the Vedas with their subsidiary lores (chap. 5 45-46 ). Adi (1.81) states 310 that there are 8800 ślokus in the whole work, the import of which only Vyūsu and Suka know and Sanjaya might know or not.371 It is further stated that

32. The Two Epics

Bhārata means the epic without the upākhyānas ( tales ) and contaius 24000 verses and the work Mahābhūrata consists of one hundred thousand verses inclusive of the upākhyānas ( Adi. 1.101-2). The Adiparva (63.89-90) states that Vyāsa 37a taught the four Vedas together with the Mahābhūruta as the fifth to four pupils viz. Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, Vaišampā. yana and to Suka his own son and these five promulyated separate five versions of the story. The Säntiparva (chap. 327. 26-33 and 349. 10-12 ) repeats the same story about the five pupils of Vyāsa. The extant Mahabharata is supposed to be the one that Vaišampāyana narrated to Janamejaya, son of Parikșit, the latter being the grand-son of Arjuna and son of Abhimanyu. It is said in Adi ( 1.9-10 ) that Sauti heard the story narrated to Janamejaya and told it to Saunaka and other sages. Thus there are (acc. to the epic itself) three stages, viz. (1) Vyasa first transmitted the epic to five pupils ; (2) these five including Vaiśumpāyana composed separate works and Vaisampayana narrated it to Janamejaya, and (3) Sakti who heard the recital by Vaišampāyana narra

ted it to Saunaka and others. Therefore, the author for the extant Mahābhārata is Sauti and Vyāsa is only connected with it mediately. In this respect it differs from the Rāmā yana, the author of which is Valmiki according to all. Janamejaya Păriksita is a famous name in Indian Antiquity. In the Ait. Br. (VIII. 21 ) it is stated that Tura Kāvaseya performed the Aindra Mahābhişeka for Janamejaya Päriksita, who conquered the whole earth and performed the Afvamedha sacrifice and there is recited a Yajña-găthā with regard to te it. He is mentioned also in the Satapatha Br. XIII. 5.4.1). What became of the other Samhitās said to have been com posed by the other disciples of Vyāsa is not known. 

In the daily tarpana as prescribed in the Aévalāyana grbya-sūtra 374 (III. 4 ) we find an echo of what we learn from the Adiparva about the four pupils (excluding Suke ) of Vyāsa viz. Sumantu - Jaimini - Vaišampāyana - Paila - Sūtra - bhāsya - Bhārata - Mahābhārata - Dharmācāryas - trpyaptu. Asvalāyana was probably aware of the difference made bet ween Bhārata and Mahābhārata. The Śănkhāyanagặhya omits the words ' Bhārata......Dharmācāryāḥ'. 

In the present edition (of the H. of Dh.) the Chitrasalā edition of the Mahābhārata with the commentary, Bhārata bhāvadīpa of Nilākantha Caturdhara, has been used. It generally agrees with the Bombay oblong edition ; sometimes, however, there is a difference of one adhyāya or a sloka or two. The Bhandarkar 0. Institute's edition is not referred to, be cause when I collected my materials it had been only recently begun and even now it is not yet complete, though nearing completion.* But, as that edition gives in the margin of each page, references to the text of three editions of the epic, it is easy to find out a passage from the text of that edition also.

Many difficult questions arise about the two epics ( which have come down to us in different recensions ), such as the origin and development of the two epics, the inter-relation of the two, the dates of the two epics; the strata, if any, in the two epics; the literature known to them, their versification ; their influence on the early and later Dharmaśāstra works ; their influence in comparatively early times on peoples beyond India. A great deal has been written on these topics by Western and Indian writers for over a century. Considerations of space make it impossible to enter upon the detailed discu ssion of the questions stated above. Yet a few remarks must, be made on some of the topics discussed by scholars. The following works and papers will give some idea of the prob lems connected with these two heirlooms of Indian antiquitaine " Zur Geschichte and Critik des Mahābhārata " by Holtzmit (Kiel, 1892-94 );' Das Rāmāyana, Geschichte und Inhalt 'Apa YUMO Dr. Jacobi ( Bonn, 1893 ), 'The Great Epic of India' by Premiere E.

It would not be proper to say nothing in this work about some of the vexed and important questions concerning the two epics, such as the approximate dates of the two, the inter-relation of the two and the question of the existence of different strata in them. These questions are inseparably intermixed and cannot be dealt with separately. Some points will first be brought out and briefly discussed and then the present author will state his own conclusions for whatever they may be worth. Winternitz (in History of Indian Litera ture' Calcutta, 1927, p. 469 ) went so far as to say that each stanza of the Mahābhārata must be judged on its own merits' and Sukthankar remarks that this is so 'when we want to use the stanza for historical and comparative purposes' and he points out (on p. 475 of Kane Festschrift ) that even a pont scholar like Oldenberg commits abysmal mistakes in the esti mate of the age and character of the passages of the Maha bhārata,

32. The Two Epics

. 

. 

It is clear that the Mahābhārata had become, long before the 7th century A. D., a work for popular education and was being recited before general audiences of men and women in India as in the 19th century. For example, on p. 61 of Peterson's edition of the Kadambari, 376 it is said that the queen Vilāgavati learnt when the epic was being recited that the son saves his father from Put hell. Similarly, it is stated in the Kādambari (p. 71 ) that the one thousand names of Nārāyana used to be recited continuously. The Kādambari (p. 90) refers to the famous Gita dleclared by Krsua, one of whose names is • Ananta'. Going further backwards, we find in the famous Besnagara376 Columu Inscription (set out in JRAS for 1909 p. 1055 ) of the 2nd century B. C. of Helio dorus, a devotee of Vasudeva and a Yona ( yavana ) ambas sador from the Greek king Antalikita to the court of king Bhaga-bhadra. The last portion in Prakrit words is 'dama, cāga, appamāda ' ( dama, tyāga and apranada), which occur in Udyogaparva 43.22 and Striparva 7. 23. 376 महाभारते वाच्यमाने श्रुतं पुन्नाम्नो नरकात्रायत इति पुत्र इति । कादम्बरी, p. 81

History of Dharmaśāstra 

It has been shown above that the Asv. gr. sūtra, which represents the last phase of Vedic literature, includes the ācāryas of Bharata, Mahābhārata and Dharma among the sages in the daily tarpuņa. The Märkandeya-purana starts by saying that it has four doubts as to Bharata (vide H. of Dh. Vol. V, p. 901 for the four questions and p. 903 for the date ). The Mrcchakatika (III. 12 ) refers to the Sauptika parva ( mārgo hyesa narendra-Sauptikavadhe pūrvam kặto Drauninā). In several places where the Vedāntasūtra relies on Smrti for support Sarkarācārya quotes only verses from the Mahābhārata.377 For example, on V. S. II. 3. 47 ( smaranti ca ) he quotes only two verses of the Mahabharata. Vide note below. This establishes that Sarkarācārya held that the Mahābhārata including the Sāntiparva ( which modern critics regard as interpolated later ) was earlier than the Vedānta sutra. The present author has attempted to establish that when the Gită ( in 13.4 ) speaks of Brahmasutrapadas it does not refer to the Brahmasūtra of Būlarāyana but to several Brahmasutras such as those of Bādari, Audulomi and Asma rathya ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 1173-74). Sabara in his bhâsya on the Pūrvamimumsi-sūtra quotes passages from the present Mahābhāratza text; vide a paper in Sukthankar volume pp. 221-229 by Prof. V. M. Apte and D. V. Garge. 

Before proceeding further it must first be emphasized that the Mahābhārata claims to be itihāsa (history ) as stated above, while the Ramayana is a kavya as expressly stated in the Rāmāyana itself several times and as comparatively early

and famous poets like Kalidasa often say.378 Therefore, it was possible for Vâliniki to vive free rein to his imagination, while in the Mahabharata some restraint had to be observed ) since what was being put forward was dubbed itihāsa. 

The words Gūtha and śloka occur in the Rgveda. Gathā ( derived from the root gai' to sing) means a song or verse. Vide Rg. VIII.32.1, VIII. 71.14, VIII.98.9, X.99.4, IX.85.6 for gåtha. The word Sloka occurs more frequently in the Rgveda than the word gathā and means a verse. In the Mahā bhārata Gathas sung by the Pitrs ( Anusāsana, 88.11-14), by Yama (Anu. 45.17 and 104.72 ) or by Janaka (Sinti 17.18-20), by Kaśyapa ( about Ksami, Vana parva 29.35-44), Gāthā about Paurava in Drona (57. 11 ) and about Bhagiratha (in Drona 60.8), of Yayati (in Sånti 26.13 and in Drona 63.8-9 ), gāthās sung by Ambarisa and by Alarka (in Asvamedhika 31. 12ff and 30. 30-31 respectively), by Brhaspati (Santi 23.14--15),by Brahman (Santi 136, about king's treasury ), gāthās sung by Usanas on distrust (Santi 138.192 ) and many more occur. Slokas also are quoted with the words Slokau cātra bhavatah' (Vanaparva 192.27-29 ) or 'bhavanti cătra ślokāh' as in Vana

parva (199. 13-15); Slokas by one who ponders over dharma as in Sauptika ( 1.53-55). Then many slokas and gāthās are quoted as Anuvassa or simply as Anuvassam (meaning genealogies handed down in families ) e. g. Vanaparva 129. 8 says'atrānuvamsam pathatah śruņu me kurunandana' and then quotes two verses. For ' Anuvamsam,' vide also Vana parva 87. 16-17 (yatrānuvainsam bhagavān Jāmadagnyag tathā jagau). For Anuvaṁsa slokas, vide Adiparva 95.8 ( for song878 of Devayani and Sarmiştha ). 

For other Anuvamsa Slokas, vide Adi. 95. 27, 95. 30-31, 95.46 ( about Santanu ). In Vana parva 88.5 there is an anu vaṁsya gāthā about Nrga. Sometimes, even itihāsa is spoken of as sung i.e. recited (gīta ). The word itihāsa is ancient. It occurs in the Atharvaveda, 380 in the Sata patha-Brāhmana (XI. 1. 6.9), in the Bșhadāraṇyaka and Chandogya Upanigads (III. 4. 2, VII. 2. 1 respectively). 

The above brief statement is quite enough to show that before the Mahābhārata was composed there were numerous verses landed down in families and that the Mahabharata utilizes and incorporates a large mass of ballads and bardic verses preserved in many prominent families. The Rāmāyana, on the other hand, is a Kävya and not an itihara and is con fined to the life of Rāma, his brothers and their vicissitudes. 

There is another quarter which sheds useful light on the epics. From Pāvini's sūtras, the Virtikas thereon and

There are in the Rāmāyana hardly any Anuvamsya ślokas referring to Dasaratha or Rama. According to tbe Sarvánu kramaņi Rāma, son of Jamadugni, is the seer of Rg. X. 110. Rāma appears to be the name of some person in Rgveda X. 93.14. Rūma Mārgaveya is the name of a person of the priestly family of Syåparna in the Ait. Br. VII. 5. 1. 

In Pan. IV. 3. 98 Vasudevaka, 381 a devotee of Vāsudeva, and Arjunaka (a devotee of or one who likes Arjuna ) are derived in the sense of bhakti' (IV. 3. 95). In VIII. 3. 95 (gaviyudhibh yām 382 sthirah ) the nome Yudhisthira, one of the principal personages in Mahābhārata, is mentioned. On Vārtika 7 (bhrātusca jyāyasah) on Pin. II. 2. 34 ('alpac taram') Patañjali states the example' Yudhişthirărjunau,' where the word Yudhisthira is put before Arjuna, though it has four vowels, because of his being the elder. In VI. 2. 38 Pärini provides for the accent (svara) of 'mahān' occurring in the compound Mahābhārata ( along with nine other words ). Vārtika 7 on Pan. IV, 1. 85 provides for the name : Asvat thảmah.' Kielhorn brings together (in I. A. vol. XIV pp. 326-27 ) all the verse quotations ( of either whole verses or half verses or pādas ) cited by Patañjali in the Mahābhāsya.

The word 'Bhakti' in the sense of worship occurs in ASTRITET97 VI. 23. The word of th: relates back to the Paart: ( 91. IV. 3,89) and also reaches forward. Therefore bhakti' in "Pāṇini' has a wider sonse than mere worship; it also means 'resort', 'liking' as in ' A pupika'( npūrā bhaktir-anya ), the songe of object of worship is not excluded from the word 'bhakti' in Panini, but that word in larger in meaning than worship’in Panini. Therefore, in IV. 3. ( Vasudevārjunäbbykin run) it is quite correct to tell

History of Dharmaśāstra 

On Pān. 1V. 1. 97 ( sulhätur-akañ ca ) the first vārtika is "Sudhātr-vyñsayoh' and we get Vaiyñsakih' ( as son of Vyāsa ) i. e. Suka ‘and Mahābhāsya on it says Vaiyasakiḥ Sukaḥ'). Some of the verses or their parts are very important and interesting about the heroes of the Mahābhārata. On Vārtika 22 on Pān. II. 2. 24 we have two quotations, viz. 

asidvitiyosnusasāra Pāndavam' (he, armed only with a sword, followed the Pandu hero ) and 'Sarkarsana-dvitiyasya balam Kșsnasya vardhatim' (in this both Krona and his brother Sankarsana are mentioned ). The first quotation (on II. 2. 24 ) clearly shows that it must have been taken from some work dealing with Pandava heroes. Another interesting quotation is 'Dhanañjayo rane rane' on' Vārtika 3 on Pán. III. 3. 58. It is well-known that Arjuna was called Dhananjaya (vide Bhagavadgitā X. 37 Pāņdavānām Dhananjayaḥ'). 

On Vārtika 11 on Pān. IV. 2. 104 Patañjali cites the wordsAkrüra-vargyah' and 'Akrūravarginah' as well as Vāsudev&-vargyah and Väsudevavarginah. This reminds one of the dialogue between Krona and Nārada reported in Santi parva, chap. 81. It appears from that chapter that there was jealousy among the Yādavas.383 Akrüra and Ahukax were two chiefs among the Andhaka-Vrsnis ( verse 8 ) and Krsna was the President of that Sangha and that Narada advises Krsna that a sangha comes to grief from internal dissensions (verse 25 ) and that Krsna should act in such a way as not to lead to the destruction of the Sarigha. Pān. (IV. 1. 114 ) knew the Andhaka vrsnis and Kurus and Patañjali on Vārtika 7 cites and explains the words Augrasenya ( from Ugrasena of the Andhaka clan ), Väsudeva and Baladeva ( among Vronis ) and Nākula, Sähadeva and Bhaimasenya ( among the Kuru clan ) 









383 

Ādi. 2 21. 29 shows that Akrūrn was a Senāpati of the Vişnis and was called "dãoapati'. Kršņa says in Santi 81. 9–10 get a वै स स्याद्यस्य स्युः कृत्स्नमेव तत् । द्वाभ्यां निवारितो नित्यं वृणोम्येकतरं न च ।। स्यातां यस्याहुकारों किं नु दुःखतरं ततः । यस्यापि च न तौ स्याता Pag I geti ga: 11'. The com. makes this clear: uth हिषयोरिव युध्यतोर्वा रणे मध्यस्थस्य मम महदुःखं तथा द्वयोः सुहोरल्यागशि FRIT FTTAITATA. Verse 11 is apt : HTË Froscanaa 702 मते । एकस्य जयमाशंसे द्वितीयस्यापराजयम् .

from Nakula, Sahadeva and Bhimasena respectively. Vide also Pāṇ. VI. 2. 34 Rājanyabahuvacana-dvandvesndhaka vrsnisu ', which refers to several rājanyas among Andhe kavrsnis. 

From the above brief references in Pāṇini and Patañjali one may affirm that the central story of the Mahābhārata is certainly older by centuries than the story of the Rāmāyana. Reference has been made to the fact that there is a Rāmopā khyāna in Vanaparva (chap. 273-292 containing about 750 verses ). It does not completely agree with the present Rāmāyaṇa text. In this Kumbhakarņa is said to have been killed by Ráma ( Yuddha. 67. 180-181 ), while in the Ramopå khyāna it is Laksmana who does 80 ( Vanaparva 287.18-19 ). Besides, in the Santiparva (chap. 29 ) there is a brief reference to Rāma's rule for 11000 years and the ideal happiness of the people under his rule. In the Dronaparva also Rāma is briefly referred to in the Sodasa -rājakiya section (chap. 55-71, that relating to Rāma being chap. 59). Stray references to a few other incidents of the Rāma story may be made here. For example, Rāma being led to pursue the gold-coloured deer ; the Sāntiparva refers briefly to the story of Sambūka. The Salyaparva mentions that Rama cut off the head of a räksasa and the Santi refers to the killing of Rāvana by Rāma through anger (361. 15 ).884 

Hopkins refers to certain passages where Vālmiki is mentioned in the Mahābhārata and divides them into two classes. In the first class he puts certain references to Val miki as meant for a mere saint (a pội), as in Sabhā 7. 16, Vanaparva 85. 119, Udyoya 93. 27, śānti 207. 4 (along with Asita, Devala and many others ). In my opinion Anusāsana 13.8 ( where Vālmīki is styled bhagavān) belongs to this first category. Then Hopkins mentions 'four passages as referring' directly to the Rāmāyaṇa (vide the great Epic of India') pp. 61 ff).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

Before proceeding to examine these four passages relied upon by Hopkins a few words must be said about the present text of the Mahābhārata. There are three elements in it, viz. the bare story of the Pandava - brothers and their cousins (usually referred to as Kauravas ), the upākhyānas ( abound ing in the Vanaparva and scattered about in other parvans also ) concerning gods, sages, brāhmanas, kings and others and didactic matter insisting on doing one's duties and the role of dharma as in Udyoga 148. 16 'yato dharmastato jayaḥ' and in Kunti's last message to Yudhisthira in Asramavāsika parva 17.21 Dharme te dhiytām budhir-manastu mahad-astu ca' and philosophy (Sankhya, Yoga, Vedānta ). There was, therefore, great scope at all times for adding stories and didactic matters. Thus the Mahābhārata became very much inflated by additions made at different times. Anyone could add a story by saying 'atrāpyudāharantimam itihăsam purātanam'. In the Anusāsana parvan alone in 25 chapters stories are introduced with these words, apart from several stories introduced in a different manner. Chap. 98 of that parvan is remarkable. There Bhisma introduces ( in the words 'atrāpyudīharanti') the story of a dialogue between Manu Prajāpati and one Suvarna who asks how the practice of the worship of deities with flowers originated and what the rewards of such worship are. Then Manu cites the story (again with the words 'atrāpyu' etc.) of the dialogue between Sukra and Bali Vairocana. Two examples may be cited about Rāma story being interpolated by devotees and enthusiasts. In chap. 74 of the Anuśñsana, apart from the evil results of the killing of a cow, the merit issuing from the gifts of cows or gold is praised and the chapter is wound up (verses 11-14) by Bhīşma who says that he learnt all this from bis Upā dhyāya to whom it came from the sages, to whom Laksmana imparted the story in the forest which Rāma had heard from his father Daśaratha who learnt it from Indra. Another similar example occurs in chap. 137 of the same parvan, which names numerous great men of the past that achieved highest worlds hy making gifts of various kinds, among whom Rāma (in verse 14), son of Dasaratha, is mentioned as having reached inexhaustible worlds by offerings in yajñas. 

Not only were tales interpolated but there are everal repetitions in the Mahābhārata. A few examples may be noted. There is in Sānti ( chap. 227 ) an enlarged version of

the brief dialogue between Indra and Bali in chap. 223; chap. 175 ( dialogue between father and son ) is practically the same as chap. 277. Salya 38. 39-45 are the same as Vanaparva 83. 116-121. The Sodasarājakiya occurs twice, once in the Droņa parva (chap. 55–71) and again in the Kantiparva chap. 29. The story of Āstika occurs twice, iu Adi 13ff and in chap. 48ff again. 

The literature known to the Mahabharata furnishes some data for making a statement about the probable date of the extant text of the epic. But as the present text is very much inflated owing to additions made at different times, it would be impossible to assign definite dates, and references to Vedas and Brāhmana works need not be cited. The six Angas are mentioned in Adi. 170. 75. In Säuti 312. 38 the Naighantu ka-padas are mentioned and the word Vrsa therein. The Nirukta of Yaska and its explanation of the word ' sipivista ' ( which occurs in Rg. VII. 100. 65-7) is mentioned in the Säntiparva.386 The Nirukta (V.8) gives the explanation of the word provided by Aupamanyava which is derogatory ( to Vişnu), wbile Yāska appears to prefer a laudatory sense and applies the word to Vişnu (as Surya), meaning 'in which rays enter on all sides )'. The Sänti (310. 21-22 ) mentious that Bphaspati knew (composed ? ) the Vedāngas, Bhargava Niti sāstra ( politics ), Nárada music ( Gándharva ), Bhāradvāja archery, Gārgya the doings of Devull, Kronātreya medicine, and some disputants ( composed ) several sidehāntas based on logic (such as Tärkika, Vaiseşika and Kápila ). It will be stat ed in the section on Manusmrti how hundreds of verses are common to the Mabābhārata and the Manusmrti. In the Anušāsana we have (in 47.35 ) mention of the Sāstra declared by Manu. Itihasa and Purāna are called the fifth Veda as early as the Chándogya Up. VII. 1. 2-4 and the Satapatha Brāhmana requires that in the Pāriplava some Purana and Itihāsa passages were to be recited on the 8th and 9th days respectively. Therefore, the numerous references to Purāna in the Great Epic are not here set out. It is important to note that a Purāna declared by Väyu is mentioned in Vana Parva (191. 16). The Svargarohanaparva ( 5. 46-47 ) states that there are 18 Puranas composed by Krsna Dvaipāyana.

Upavedas are mentioned in Drona parva 202. 75. Dhanur. veda is mentioned in Santi 49. 32, 50. 233 and 167. 31. 

The word 'Dharmaśāstresu' occurs frequently as shown above (vide pp. 13, 300-1 ). Individual writers on Dharma sāstra ( apart from Manu ) are also quoted e. g. Yama in Santi 82. 31, Aigiras ( two verses ) in Santi 69. 71-73; Usanas on slaying an atatāyin386 ( a desperado like an incendiary or a 

poisoner ) may be killed outright in self-defence. 

In Anusāsana 18. 38 Garga is said to have obtained the knowledge of the sixty-four Kalas (arts) and in Salya-parva 37. 145 Garga is said to have gained on the banks of Sarasvati knowledge of kāla and about the movements of heavenly bodies. Astronomer Garga is assigned to 50 B. C. by Kern ( vide Preface to Brhat-samhita p. 50)and H. of Dh. Vol. V pp. 79 and 592 n 878. 

It appears that by the time the Mahābhārata assumed its present form Buddhist and Jain ideas had acquired influence among the people. For example, the Vanaparva387 ( 181.42-43) says 'truthfulness, self-restraint, tapas, charity, ahimsa, constant adherence to dharma, these are the means (of higher life ) ainong men, not caste nor family.' Santiparva says

(188. 10 ) 'there is no difference among the (four) varṇas; this world is Brāhma (belongs to Brahmă ), because it was formerly created by Brahmā and was, (later) reduced to differ ent varṇas by their (diverse) actions'. The Santiparva annou nces Truthfulness, charity, freedom from hatred and wickedness, humility, kindness and tapas,-where these are seen, he is known as brāhmana. If these characteristics are found in a südra and these do not exist in a twice-born person then the Sūdra is not a südra and the so-called brāhmaṇa is not a brāhmaṇa. This approaches the teaching of the Dha mmapada verses 383, 393 (yamhi satyam ca dhammo ca 80 sukhi 80 ca brāhmanah). Similiarly, in Anušāsana 115 Yudhisthira asked Bhisma 'you have often declared that ahimeâ is the highest dharma and you also said that in śrāddhas the pitre desire to have flesh offered'. Buddhist vibāras ( Vana° 188. 56 ) had come into existence and Eļūkas (structures over the bones of the dead); are mentioned in Vana parva ( 90. 65, 67). A naked Ksapanaka ( Digambara Jain) is mentioned in Adi 3. 126; in Santi 232. 21388 the Jain posi tion seems to have been alluded to and also in Afvamedhika 49. 2. In Adiparva 70. 46 it is stated that in Kanva's hermi tage there were leaders of Lokāyatika views along with students of Vedas and Moksadharma. 

On Pāṇ. III. 2. 111 the Mahābhāsya cites jaghāna Kam sam kila Vāsudevaḥ' (on Vārtika 2 ' parokte ca lokavijñāte prayoktur-darsana visaye') and on Vārtikas 6 and 15 the Mahābhāsya makes very interesting remarks about Kansa vadha (the killing of Kamsa by Krona ) described in stories, drawn in paintings and represented in dramas; vide Vol. V. p. 130 notes 329-30 and p. 203 note 521. The Mahābhāsya asks the question bow one can use the present tense (in Kamsam ghātayati) when Kamsa was killed in antiquity. That shows that centuries before the Mahābhāsya ) works (stories and dramas ) had been composed on the killing of

Kamsa by Kęsụa. That some verses quoted by the Maha bhāsya are found in the Mahabharata is shown in the note below. 380 

The date of the Mahābhāsya is generally accepted to be about 150 B, C.; vide (pp. 75-79 above). It quotes a quarter of a verse stating that some person followed the Pandava hero with only a sword in his hand and Pāṇini knows the central figures of the great Epic viz. Yudhisthira and Arjuna. It has been shown above (p. 75 ) that Panini flourished about 450 to 400 B.C. Therefore, it follows that there were poems about Pandava heroes and about Krsna killing Kamsa some time before 400 B. C. Scholars would have to assign 500 B. C. as the latest date for the core of the Mahābhārata. 

Another circumstance pointing to the same conclusion is that the Asv. Gș. mentions " Bhārata-Mahābhārata dharmă cāryāḥ'. The Gșhyagūtras belong to the latest phase of the Vedic literature. The mention of Bhārati and Mahābhārata as preceding the Āśv. Gș. would make it very probable that the Mahābhārata was in existence at least just before the end of the Vedic period. 

One warning already given by Winternitz in ' History of Indian Literature' (Calcutta, 1927 p. 469) and accepted by the late Dr. V. S. Sukthankar (in 'Epic Studies' VIII in Kane Festschrift p. 474 ) with an addition is that when we want to use a stanza for historical and comparative purposes each

such stanza must be judged on its own merits'. But life being short, this would be an almost impossible task for one scholar for the one hundred thousand stanzas of the Mahābhārata. 

But if we turn to the Rāmāyana, none of the great per sonages depicted in that epic such as Daśaratha, Rāma, Laks mana, Bharata (Rama's brother ), Hanāmat, Sugriva, Bibhisana is inentioned by Pāņini or in quotations cited in the Mahābhāsya. Those who want to argue that the present Rāmāyaṇa was known to Patañjali rely on a few matters, such as the reference to Kiskindhi and two verses891 about Vānarasainyu in the Mahābhāsya. These two verses do not occur in the Rāmāyana at all; besides, here "Vänarasainya' does not necessarily mean an 'army of monkeys'; it may play. fully be applied to a crowd or number of monkeys; and moreover such verses illustrating the use of the same root in the Parasmaipada and Ātmanepada might have been com posed by a teacher of grammar for the benefit of his pupils. As there is a parody of Dasaratha, Rāma and Sită in the Dasarathajätaka, it is probable that some decades before 250 B. C. there existed a popular story about these three. Some further remarks will be made in the section on Rāmā yana. 

The first of the four passages relied upon by Hopkins is 'api cĀyam pura gitah bloko Vālmīkinā bhuvi i na hantavyāḥ striya iti yad-braviși plavangama...Piļākaram amitrānām

yat-syāt kartavyam eva tat' (Dronaparva 14.67-68 ).32 The criticisms against this citation are several. One is that what is quoted is not a Sloka at all, but only a pāda (quarter) at the most; secondly, the Sloka in the Rāmāyana does not amount to an absolute rule, but there is a counterpoise in the latter half of the śloka ; another criticism is that the Maha bhārata itself had already stated in the Adiparva and Vana parva the same rule against killing a woman. So it is proba ble that some interpolator mentioned it in the Dronaparva to show off his knowledge of the other epic. As regards the 2nd citation I am sorry to say that Hopkins is carried away by his enthusiasm to prove direct quotations from the Rāmā yana in the other epic. In the Rāmāyana, the verse 'răjāpam prathamam vindet' does not occurses at all. Hopkins is obliged to say that it agrees closely enough in sense and words with the verse in Ayodhyā 67. 11. The verge from Ayodhyā is not ipsissima verba'. There is another gratuitous assumption made by him. He thinks that Bhargava is Vālmiki. Bhargava 

means Usanas. Vide Amarakosass quoted below. Hopkins, in spite of his learning and industry, here forgets that the Sāntiparva ( 210. 20 ) ascribes \# Nitisāstra to Bhargava and among the expounders of Rājaśästra385 the Santiparva mentions

Kāvya (i.e. Ušanas ) and Bhargava 306 as identical. Vālmīki's name has nowhere been mentioned as that of an expounder of Rājaśāstra. The Rāmāyana itself regards Usanas ( Sukra ) and Bhargava as identical when it describes the auspicious appearances on Rāma's invasion of Rävana's capital ( Yuddha 4.49 ). Vide above under Kautilya's Arthaśāstra where pa88a ges from the Mahābhārata on the Rājaśāstra of Uganas have been quoted. Hopkins misunderstands the verse. What it means is: the life of Rāma was recited to some king by a court poet or possibly by Bhargava Uśanas himself the expounder of Rajasõstra, who thereon recited the famous verse 'rājānam prathamam vindet &c,' because the underlying idea of that expounder was 'no king, no dharma nor security'. It is quite possible that both (i, e. Mahābhārata and Rāmāyana ) quote from a common source viz, the Rājaśāstra of Kavya Uśanas which once existed but has not yet been recovered. 

The third passage occurs in the Vana parva, where Bhima is said to have met Hanumat on the Gandhamādana but did not recognize him and took him to be a mere ordinary monkey (chapters 146 ff). There he speaks of Hanumat as his brother and very famous 397 in the Rāmāyana (147. 11). Vālmīki's name is not mentioned in those chapters and this story was proba bly interpolated later. The Vanaparva is in extent next to the Santiparva. These two and the Anusasana parva cover about two-fifths of the whole of the extant Mahabharata. The 4th passage ( quoted in the note below )308 on which Hopkins relies occurs in the last chapter of the Harivamsa (which is a khila) and not at all in the text of the Mahā. bhārata in the Chitrashala edition and others. 

The above discussion shows that out of the four passages relied upon by Hopkins one is wrongly interpreted, two are not in the Mabābhārata at all and the remaining one is pro bably interpolated.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

The most puzzling question concerning the Mahābhārata is how the members of a polyandrous family became the heroes of the great national epic. Even in the extant epic attempts are made to explain the matter in a supernatural way. In the Asramavāsikaparva it is stated that after the carnage in the great war, Dhịtarăstra, Vidura, Kunti ( the mother of five Pandavas ), Gāndhāri, Draupadi, Subbadrā met together and sages like Vyāsa, Nārada, Parvata and others also came when Dhịtarăstra complained that he had no sleep and no peace of mind and Gándhårī requested Vyāsa to vouch safe to Dhrtarăstra the sight of his fallen sons. Kunti told Vyāsa (Asramavāsikaparva chap. 30 ) how Durvāsas ( an irate sage ) came to her father (a king ) for alms when she was yet a maiden and as she pleased the sage by her assidu ous hospitality, he gave her five mantras on repeating any one of which the god addressed in that mantra would come to her. She proceeded to say that when she saw from her father's palace the rising sun, she called him to come by reciting the appropriate mantra, the sun came and she duly requested him to grant her a son, when the Sun's refulgence entered her and she secretly gave birth to a son (later ) called Karna, whom she let down in a river. She wanted to see that son whom she abandoned. Then Vyāsa consoled her that she was not to be blamed, that deities enter human bodies, that human limi tations do not apply to deities and he recited a verse that everything is pure and wholesome to the strong. 808 

In the Adiparva (chap. 169 ) a similar story is repeated almost in the same words that a maiden requested God Sankara five times to bestow on her a husband and so he ble ssed her that she would have five husbands ( pati ) and she became later Draupadi, daughter of king Drupada. Adiparva (197, 35-36 and 44 ff) states the same kind of story, but it is Laksmi (in Svarga ) who asks five times for a husband. 

In Adiparva the question how a polyandrous marriage was allowed in the case of the five Pandava heroes has been raised and dealt with in chapter 195, verses 27-31. Drupada (father of Draupadi) urges that five brothers should have one wife is adharma, it is opposed to the Veda and the use

of the people. The reply of Yudhisthira is: 'Dharma is subtle; we only follow the path of our predecessors. I never told a lie nor am I bent on adharma. But my mother says that we five should have the same woman as wife.400 If one may speculate on the origin of the Pandavas, it is possible that they hailed from the hilly regions in the Himalayas where polyandry prevailed up to recent times, that they were formidable warriors and made their way in the countries of Kuru and Pañcāla and married a Pāñcâla princess. The desceudants of the Pandava heroes viz. Pariksit and Janame jaya are well-known in the Vedic age. The Sat. Br. XIII. 4.5 and Ait. Br. 35. 1 mention Päriksita Janamejaya as a performer of Afvamedha. Dasaratha, Rama and their descendants are not spoken of in these ancient works. 

In Anushgana (115. 68-75 ) about fifty ancient kings are named that gave up flesh-eating in Kaumuda (Kårtika) month and therefore they went to heaven. These passages of the great epic would have to be assigned at the most to à century or two before the Christian era. 

The Raināyana ( Ayodhyā 109.34 ) contains a down-right condemnnation of Buddha401 as năstika (atheist ) and 88 & thief and in chap. 108 of the same epic Jābāli is introduced as an atheist who condemns in the presence of Rāma tbe finer virtues of respect for parents and other relatives, the institu tion of Srāddha, condemns those who talk of the other world and asks Rāma not to leave the kingdom in favour of Bharata. 

The two epics have in common many striking verses. For example, in the story of the Kapota bird and the lubdhaka (hunter) where the Kapota burnt itself in order to offer food to the hungry hunter and the female bird, on the death of the male bird, entered fire and killed herself, a fine verse is put in

the mouth of the female bird in Säntiparva 148. 6–7.403 In the Ayodhyākānda 39. 30-31 Sitä repeats the same verse be fore Kausalyā when she prepares to go into exile with Rāma. Another famous verse of the propriety of punishing even a guru when he becomes conceited, fails to distinguish between what ought to be done or not to be done and who pursues the wrong path 403 occurs in both. The Säntiparva (in 57.6 ) says that in former times king Marutta recited an ancient bloka in Brhaspati's treatise in the section on kings (Rājādhi kāra ) and that it is 57.7. Another verse that occurs in both epics is : all collections end in dissolution, all tall things end in falling down, unions end in separation, life ends in death.404 

The discussions so far beld make this clear that the main characters of the Mahabharata were known long before Panini and that tales relating to Pāņdava heroes had been embodied in a work or in works in verse long before Patañjali wrote i. e. that the core of the Mahabhārata existed before 500 B. C. The same cannot be said about the Rāmāyana. There is no evidence to show that the principal characters of the Rāmå yana were known to Pāṇini or even to Patañjali. At the most one can say that the three names, Dasaratha, Rāma and Sitä, were probably known about 250-200 B. C. but not described

as endowed with the qualities they bear in the extant Rāmā. yana. Therefore, one may conclude that there was a Bhärata epic long before there was a Rāma epic. From the way in which the Vānaras led by Angada ( Kişkindhā 41. 6ff) among whom were included such doughty fighters as Hanûmat, Nila, Jámbavat, were directed to go from Kişkindhā towards the south in search of Sitā carried away to Lankā by Rāvana, one feels that the author did not correctly know the different countries that the Vānaras would have had to traverse before reaching Lanka. Sugrīva is said to have told them to go from Kiskindha to the south and one is surprised to read that Sugriva first mentions the Vindhya mountain with its thousand peaks and immediately afterwards Narmadā (chap. 41.8 ) and then mentions Godávarī, Kronavenī, Varadā ( 41.9), Mekala, Utkala, Dasārna towns, Avanti ( 41.10 ), Vidarbha, Vanga, Kalinga ( 41.11 ). It is unnecessary to cite more. The present writer is constrained to hold that whoever wrote that chapter was an inhabitant of a place north of the Narmadā (which springs from Mekala )405 and knew only the names of towns, rivers and countries without knowing their exact loca tion. The author had probably never been to the island of Ceylon nor kuew anything about the distance between India and Ceylon nor haid he any idea about the extent of Ceylon. It was all a poetic fancy without any solid basis of known facts, even ancient. Kiskindhā is now shown to be a village on the Tungabhadrā river in the Bellary District. We know from the Aranyakānda ( chap. 13 ) that Agastya directed Rāma to have a hut in Pañcavați near Godāvari and from that place be later went to Royamūka near Pampā where dwelt Sugriva with four others ( Aranya. 72.11-12 ). 406

History of Dharmaśāstra 

It has been shown above that the Rāma story and chara cters are mentioned in the extant Mahābhārata and the legends and some well-known characters in the Mahābhārata are noted in the extant Ramayana. Therefore, all that one can say is that both works have influenced each other. But As the core of the Mahābhārata is much older than that of the Rāmāyana and as the Mahābhārata is four times as bulky as the Rāmāyana, it is the latter that most probably borrowed several matters from the great Epic. It has been demonstre ted above that the so-called four direct references in the Mabābhārata to the Rāmāyana put forward by Hopkins are not so and that only one remains, which appears to me to be a later interpolation. 

Just as the story of Nala-Damayanti was set out in the Mahābhārata from a tale current in early days, so the Rāma story might have been only a popular tale in the beginning and was later turned into an epic, but the Mahābhārata, if it had directly borrowed from the Rāmāyana, would not have differed from the epic on such an important matter as the killer of Kumbhakarna. Therefore, it is very probable that the Rāma tale was included in the Vanaparva at a time when the Rāmāyana in its present form did not exist. The present writer holds that the Mahābhārata assumed its present form certainly before the Christian era, but how much earlier it is difficult to say.

Conference at Dar bhanga ( 1048 ), pp. 206-218 tries to show that Lankā is the present Ceylon and supports his viow by referring to the Sundarakānda, Mahavamsa, Rājāvali and some similar works. I regret that his arguments aro far from convincing. In tho Sundarakānda Lanka is not an island but is described as tho capital of Rāvana situated beyond the sea on the slopes of Trikūta and surrounded by a wall as the versos quoted below testify. The Mahābhārata mentions Sinhala and Lanká soparntoly (Vanaparva 01. 23 Sinhalan Barba. rån mlecchun ye ca Lankiniviisinaḥ ). The Dipavamsa is the ear: liest chroniolo (about Ceylon) and it is not oarlier than the 4th ceatury A. D. and the Mahavarisa is much later (6th century or later ).

Hopking497 devotes pp. 386-403 of his work The Great Epic of India' to the date of the Epic and summarises his con clusions on pp. 397-398. On p. 398 he says there is no date of the Epic' which will cover all its parts (though handbook makers may safely assign it in general to the 2nd century B. C.). A sizable volume would be required to criticize his remarks on several matters and to expose the hollowness of his hasty and one-sided conclusions. To take only one exa mple at random. He relies (p. 387) on the occurrence of the word Dināra in the Harivamsa which is only a supplement to the Mahābhārata and on the fact that in the present text of the Epic ( Adiparva chap. 2.82-83 ) reference is made to the Harivaṁsa as a Khila, in which are included the deeds of Visnu such as killing Kamsa and the Bhavisya parva, wbich is a large and wonderful one amony Khilas. 408 The Dināra is not mentioned in the 18 parvans of the Mahābhārata (not even in Santiparva nor in Anušāsa naparva ) as Hopkins admits on p. 387. Supposing for a moment that the mention of dināra in Harivaṁsa is not interpolated, still from the reference to Harivassa in Adi I. 2 in general it does not necessarily follow that the writer of Adi. 2 had before him a Harivamsa contai ning the word Dināra. Besides, his dating about the Intro duction of Dināras in India is not supported by satisfactory evidence. He states ( on p. 387 ) " for the Roman denarius is known to the Harivamsa and the Harivamsa is known to the first part of the first book and the last book; hence such parts of this book as recognize the Harivarsa must be later than

He does not mention the evidence on which he bases his conclusion about the exact period of the Introduction of the Denarius in India. For the date of early Denarius coins, vide Pro. of British Academy, Vol. XVIII for 1932 pp. 211-266.409 

The Romakas are mentioned in Sabhāparva 51.17. One remarkable matter is as follows. The Apastamba Dh.S. II. 5. 11.5-6 are' Rājñaḥ panthā brāhmanevāsametya' and 'gamety. tu brāhmaṇasyaiva panthah'. These two sūtras form the second half of the verse in Vana parva 133.1 (the first half being 'And hasya panthāḥ... bhūra vāhasya panthāḥ &c ). 

Vyāba or the Mahābhārata has been mentioned in some early inscriptions. 

For example, the Pardi plates of Dahra-sena of Samvat 207 (probably of the Kalacuri or Chedi era i. e. of 456 A. D.) ascribes the verse 'şaşțim varsa sahasrāại' &c. (in E. I. Vol. X. p. 53 ) to Vyāsa. Gupta Ing. No. 31 at p. 137 (the Khoh copper-plate of Mahārāja Sarvanātha dated in 204 of the Gupta era i.e. 533 A. D. ) says 'uktam ca Mahābhārate Vyāsena'.410 This inscription establishes that long before 530 A. D. the Great Epic was deemed to have one hundred thousand verses composed by Vyāsa. It has been already shown how in Bana's day the Epic was recited to an audience of men and women. Several hundred verses are commou to both the Manuşmộti and the Mahābhārata. Commentators of Dharmaśāstra works from early times quote the Mabā bhārata. Medhātithi on Manu II. 94 quotes one of Yayāti's verses about Kāma (desire ) being insatiable. On Manu

That paper shows that formerly it wag believed that the Donarius was introducted in 269 B, C. But on a fresh appraisal it is stated (od p. 214 ) that we may rogard 190 B. C. as a close approximation to the true date. On. p. 254 it is shown that the first issue of the paper denaring was in 187 B. C. In plate III accompanying the vol. No. 32 is a donarius of 42 B. C. and No. 33 of 99, 94 B. C. Hence Dinarius could have been introduced in India in 150 B. C. 

On p. 137 (Gupta Inscription No. 31 ) the Inscription ends with tho words 'उक्तं च महाभारते शतसाहस्यां संहितायां परमर्षिणा पराशर• सुतेन वेदव्यासेन व्यासेन । पूर्वदत्तां द्विजाति ... पालनम् ॥ प्रायेण हि . वसुन्धराम् ॥ बहुभिर्वसुधा ... तदा फलम् ॥ षष्टिवर्षस...नरके वसेत् ।। स्वंद

On Manu VII. 177 he quotes the well-known verse na kascit kasyacit' ( quoted above). The Mit. quotes the Mahābhārata or Vyāsa frequently (e. g. on Yāj. 1.72,86, 256, III. 6, 250, 258, 300 ). Aparārka quotes from the Mahābhārata dozens of verges, but the quotations from Vyāsa include many verses on Vyava bāra attributed to Vyāsa which do not occur in the Mahā bhārata. The Křtyakalpataru sparingly quotes the Mahā bhārata. It is unnecessary to refer to other and later digests on the question of the, date and text of the Mahābhārata. 

When ancient Indians came to Java they brought with them their sacred books. The Mahābhārata soon became most popular among the Javanese. Portions of the Mahă bhārata were renderad into old Javanese or Kavi poetry. This work is known as Brata Yuda (modern Javanese) i.e. Bhārata Yuddha. The Kalasan Inscription of the suka year 700 ( 778 A. D. ) found in a temple in central Java is the earliest Javanese Inscription written in a North Indian script. It was published by Dr. R. G.

paper on 'Manipravāla in Java'in ‘Kunhan Raja Presentation volume pp. 65-69' shows how from the 12th century A. D. onwards poems were composed in Java in the local kavi language, employed different Sanskrit metres and took over stories from the Sanskrit kāvyas of Kālidāsa, Bhāravi and the episodes in the Mahābhārata and adopted Sanskrit theories of rhetoric and ala; kāras (figures of speech ). Several European scholars have worked on this subject. Vide for example, Louis Finot's learned paper in I. H. Q. vol. I pp. 599-622 ( on the geography and chronology of Indian civilization in Indo China') in which he gives the names of several Dutch and French scholars ( as his predecessors in the same field ). He remarks India has laid her mark on all the great Eastern countries some of which received a substantial part of their religious and artistic culture from India and others are indebted to her for their very existence as civilized states'.

The commentary called Bhāratabhāvadīpa of Nilakantha Caturdhara ( son of Govinda ) on the Mahābhārata (printed in the Ch. ed. ) is a learned one. In the opening verses at the beginning of Adiparva he praises one Laksmaņārya, then two ancestors of his viz. Nārāyana and Dhireśa who are again named with reverence in Sabhā l.1 as Hamiranurya (i.e. residing in Hamirapur ). At the beginning of Udyoga parva he calls bimself Laksmana padinuga ( following in the footsteps of Laksmana ); again on Vanaparva 129. 9 he states that followers of Lakşmalla who was the ornament of a family of persons well-versed in knowledge of brahman explains that verse differently. At the beginning of Bhismaparva, chap. 25 ( i.e. the Bhagavadgiti ) he performs an obeisance to Sridhara and others as 'sadgurūn'. This Sridhara is, it appears, the commentator of the Bhagavata purana. On

He quotes a verse of Dattatreya on Khecari Muură (on Āśvamedhika 19.37). In many places he discusses various readings as on Ādi 214.2, Sabhā 16.3 (Gaudlapātha ) and 21.16 (Gaudopatha ), Vanaparva 239.4 (Gauda pātha ), discusses three readings on Vana parva 264.12.

end of the Säntiparva and of Anušāganao he enumerates 414 the several teachers (eight in all) under whom he learnt Vedānta, Mahābhāsya, Veda with its subsidiary lores, logic, Srauta &c. 

He mentions Niruktabhāsya on Vanaparva 291.70 and also Vedabhāsya (i.e. Sāyaṇabhāsya ) on Jarūtha (occurring in Rg. VII. 1.7 and X. 80.3). He appears to have been & Mahārāstra brāhmana. On Udyoga 143.25 he explains 'eka paksāksicaranāḥ'as pārkoli' (a bird ) in Mahārāsţrabhāgā; on Adiparva 63.20 he explains 'pitakaiḥ' as 'petyä iti bhā Bāyām' which is Marathi 'petī' or 'petyā'. He refers to the custom of raising a bamboo staff at the end of a year and the beginning of a new one (in Adi. 63. 18-19 ) as seen in Mahā răstra and other places. On Sabhā 21.20 he explains the word 'Srnga' as 'Manurī', which is' Manorā' in present Marathi; on Sānti 87.35 he explains ·gominaḥ'as 'căranas' which is & Marathi word. On Vana' 93.27 he explains * Kathinānăm as Kāthi iti Mahürüstra prasiddhah'. Though a Mahārāstrian he knew Yavanabhāsā as on Sabhā 4,2 he ex plains that'Jivantī’ is called ' viriji' in Yavanabhāśā. 

As he refers to the Medinikoga and the Kālamadhava he is certainly later than the 14th century A. D. In 'Indian Culture' vol. I pp. 706-710 it is stated that Arjunamisra, a Varendra brābmana who flourished in the latter part of the 13th century is a better commentator than Nilakantha. Vimalabodha wrote a commentary on the Mahabharata called Vimalasloki or Durghatárthaprakāśini, a ms, of which is in possession of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute ( Poona). Vide Gode's paper

in Silver Jubilee Vol. of the BORI pp. 146 ff. Vide Dr. Raghavan's paper in Kane Festschrift (pp. 351-355 ) for some commentators of the Mahābhārata such as Varada, Yajñanārāyaṇa and Anandapurna (about 1350 A. D. ), parts of whose commentaries are found in mss. collections. 

The extant Mahābhārata professes that it is removed from the Mahābhārata war only by two generations or 80. It was narrated by Vaisam pāyana to Janamejaya who was the great-grandson of Arjuna. The topics regarding the beg inning of the Kaliyuga and the astronomical data in the Mahābhārata have been discussed at some length in the 3rd volume of the H. of Dh. pp. 896-923. 

The probable date of the Mahābhārata war has been dis cussed by the present author in H. of Dh. Vol. III pp. 895 923 and Vol. V. p. 849. There are three dates put forward from comparatively early times, viz. 3101 B. C. (the tradi tional date );( 2 ) that of the Brhat-samhitā and Rājatarangini (viz. about 653 of Kali age ); (3) that of the Vāyu, Matsya, Brabmanda and Bhagavata purāņas which provide that bet ween the birth of Pariksit ( grandson of Arjuna, the outstand ing fighter among the Pandavas ) and the coronation of Nanda there is a period of 1500 (or 1050 or 1015 years, according to various readings in the mss of those Purānas ). Almost all modern scholars discard the idea that the Mahābhārata was composed a short time after the war. Similarly, the matters in the Sānti and Anusasana parvans containing over twenty thousand verses are stated to have been declared by Bhisma, who was mortally wounded but lay on death-bed till the sun turned northwards. This was a very helpful camouflage to insert into the Epic any matter deemed worthy of being put in. In the Parvasa nigrahaparva ( Adi. 2.325-331 ) it is stated that in the Sāntiparva there are 329 udhyāyas ( chapters ) and 14732 verses and in Adi. 2.331-338 it is stated that in the Anuśāsana parva there are 146 adhyāyas and 8000 verses. In the Chitraslala edition there are 365 chapters in the Santi parya and 168 in the Anusasanaparva. Thus the chapters in the two parvans (in the present text ) exceed the number of chapters stated in Adiparva, chap. 2. It is possible that later redactors arranged the chapters differently for varidus reasons. In the Santiparva the longest adhyāya ( 138 ) 221 verses, then comes chap. 284 with 208 verses. On the 

INST

other hand the shortest chap. of Sintiparva is 363 (of six verses only ), chapters 353 and 365 have only nine verses each, while some chapters (such as 129, 136, 304, 352 ) have only eleven verses. A few chapters like 192, 338, 342 have a few verses and also long prose passages. I have calculated the verses in the Santiparva and they come to about 13200 or so in the Chitrashala edition, but if one takes into account the prose passages (and calculates them as versified with 32 letters in each verse ), then there would not be much divergence in the number of slokas. Vide C. V. Vaidya's 'Mahābhārata: a criticism', Appendix, note one, for the total of chapters and slokas in the 18 parvans and the kbila Harivaṁsa stated in the Parvasangrahaparva and in the Bombay edition. They are respectively 96836 and 95826 blokas. Therefore, the reputed extent of the Mahābhārata even in early inscriptions (the Khoh plate of 533 A. D. ) viz. one hundred thousand is only approximate; vide Dr. Sukhtankar's paper in ABORI, Silver Jubilee Volume, (1943) pp. 549-558 for remarks on the figures mentioned in the Parvasangrahaparva. 

The Mahābhārata not only repeats tales but also single verses of its own e.g. Sänti, chap, 231.31 repeats Gită 8.17 (sahasra yuga'), chap. 251.9 is the same as Gītā (11.70, āpūryamānam ), chap. 312.14 ( sarvatah pário) is same as Gītā 13.13; Vana parva 189.27 (yada yadā ca dharmasya ) is the same as Gitā 1V. 7. 

In the two epics genealogies of ancient kings occur fre quently and it is impossible to reconcile all of them. A few simple examples may be cited. The Manusmrti (in I. ) claims that Brahmā first ( 1.32 ) created Viraj who created him (Manu) and he (Manu) created (1.35 ) the great sages ( Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulaha, Pulastya, Kratu, Pracetas Vasistha, Bhrgu and Nārada ) and they created the seven Manus (1.36 ) and the world was created by them. If we turn to the Mahabharata, the Anuśasana (chap. 2.5 ft') tells us that Manu Prajāpati's son was Iksvāku, who had one hundred sons of whom Daśāśva was the 10th. But the Vana parva (iu chap. 201-202 ) speaks of Ikyvāku, his son Sasida ( who ruled in Ayodhyā ), his son Kakusthu, bis son Anenas, whose son was Pșthu-whose son was Visvagaśva, whose son was Adki wlinse son was Yuvanāśva and so on. In the Āsvamedljikapare (chap. 4 ) the genealogy is ( in Kytayugu ) Manu-son Krasan

32. The Two Epics 

383 

dhi-son Ksupa-son Ikşvāku (chap. 4.3-14 ). If we now turn to the Rāmāyana, chap. 110 of the Ayodhyākānda furni. shes a long pedigree (in verses 5-34 ) as follows: Brahmă Marici-Kaśyapa-Vivasvat-Manu Vaivasvata Prajāpati-Iks vāku (the first king of Ayodhyā )-Kuksi-Vikukşi-Bana Anaraṇya-Pythu-Trišajku -- Dhundumāra - Yuvadāśva - Mān dhātr-Susandhi-Dhruvasandhi-- Bharata-Asita-Sāgara - A82 mañja - Aṁśumān - Dilipa - Bhagiratha - Kakustha - Raghu Pravệddha. Kalmāsarāda -Sankhana - Sudarsana - Agnivarna Sighraga-Maru-Prasuśruva-Ambarisa-Nahusa-Nābhāga-Aja Daśaratha-Rāma. This pedigree contradicts the one in Manu smrti ( 1.34-35 ) set out a little above, where Marici is one of the ten sons of Manu. Let us now turn to the Raghuvamsa, where ( in 1.11-12 ) it is stated that Vaivasvata Manu was the first king, that among his descendants was king Dilipa, whose son was Raghu whose son was Aja whose son was Dasaratha. It should be noted that in the Ayodhyākānda two kings inter vene between Dilipa and Raghu and between Raghu and Aja ten kings are named. Hence it follows that the Ayodhyā. kānda pedigree is either an inflated one or that Kālidasa had a different pedigree before him at least from Dilipa downwards or that Kūlidasa was not aware of the longer pedigree. From the Raghuvamsa itself it appears that Kūlidāsa knew the story of Sagara as an ancestor of Rama and the story of his Aśvamedha horse being carried to the bottom of the earth and the digging of the earth for finding it and the ocean being filled with the waters of Ganges ( Raghu. XIII. 31 ); he also knew the story of Bhagiratha taking the Ganges from the matted hair of Śiva (Raghu IV.32 ) to the earth and of Kaku stha being a descendant of Iksvāku ( Raglu VI. 71 ). It is not unlikely that a very long pedigree was manufactured for the glory of the family of Rama and Kalidasa was not pre pared to accept it in its entirety. It may be noted that Bāna in the Harsacarita ( 6th ucсhvĀsa p. 38 of my edition ) holds that Raghu was the son of Dilipa. 

Both the epics inspired many later writers to compose Sanskrit dramas based on the characters and the various stories contained in them. The Dasarūpaka416 recommend

that intending dramatists should rely upon the Rāmāyana and the Bșhatkatbā for plots. Dr. V. Raghavan recently published a work on 'Some old lost Rāma plays' (Annamalai University, 1961). 

It appears from Kautilya's Arthaśāstra that it knew the central story of the Mahābhārata and that of the Rāmāyana. For example, on I. 6. 8 ( Arthaśāstra ) it is stated that Rāvana perished since he did not restore another's wife owing to pride and Duryodhana perished because he on account of pride did not agree to give a portion of the kingdom. In Arthaśāstra VIII. 3. 41-43 reference is made to Jayatsena and Duryodhana winning in gambling because of expertness in it and Nala and Yudhisthira lost in gambling. In the Mahābhārata, however, Nala's opponent is said to have been Puskara ( and not Jayatsena). There is little to show that the Arthasāstra refers to literary works like the Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyana and not to tales current among people in its day. 

The Mahābbārata is predominently a Vaimna vite work and contains two of the five jewels of Vuisuavism viz. the Gītā and the one thousand names of Visnu (in Anušāsana parva 149. 14-120). 

But it is not at all so thorough going in its dogma as are some medieval South Indian works of the 11th and later centuries A. D. The Anušāsana ( 17. 31–153 ) contains 1008 names of Siva also. In many places the identity of Siva and Višņu is emphasized as in Vanaparva and Santiparva.416 There are grand eulogies of Siva in Dronaparva 80. 39-48 and Sau ptikaparva 17 ( this last by Krsna ). In Anušāsana (16.8) Siva is identified with Bruhman.

The Mausala parva417 ( chap. 7) varrates that, after Krona passed away, Arjuna went alone to Dvārakā in order to bring his wives and the Yādava women to the Pārdava capi tal, that Arjuna was attacked by the Abhiras on his way and the Abhiras forcibly carried away many ladies and some went with them of their own free will. Moreover, in Salya Parva 61. 28 ff,418 where Duryodhana, being mortally wounded by a mace stroke on the thigh by Bhima, severely upbraided Vasudeva for the breaches of the rules such as putting up Sikhandip against Bhisma and Yudhisthira's prevarication about the death of Asvatthāmā. Then Vasudeva referred to Duryodhana's evil deeds ( verses 42-47 ), such as not giving & share to Pandavas in the paternal estate, poisoning Bbima, trying to burn Pandavas together with their mother in 

jatugļha', taking by force Draupadi to the Sabbā when she was in her monthly period, assault on the very young Abhi manyu by many of Duryodhana's partisans, and added that he Wag killed for all these misdeeds. The text says that the gods showered flowers on Duryodhana and Gandharvas played on musical instruments &c. (verses 55-58). If the great epic had been a thoroughgoing Vaishave work these incidents would not have been mentioned by it.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

THE RĀMĀYAŅA It is remarkable that an Italian scholar G. Gorrecio, published the text of the Rāmāyana in five volumes ( the first being published in 1843 A. D. with a long Introduction of 143 pages and the Uttarakānda being omitted ) and five more volumes of translations, Prefaces and Indexes, the 10th volume being published in 1858 A. D. The Rāmāyana has been edited in several places e. g. by the Gujarati Press of Bombay in seven volumes ( with three commentaries ) and by the Nirnaya sāgara Press (text in two volumes ) in 1905. A critical edition of the Rāmāyana on the lines of the Poona critical edi tion of the Mahābhārata was undertaken at Baroda and 80 far the first three kāndas have been issued. In the present edition of the H. of Dh. the one volume edition of the text of the Rāmāyana published by Mr. R. Narayanaswami Aiyar and edited by a committee of four scholars in 1933 and based on four palm-leaf mss. and several printed editions has been used. 

There are several recensions of the Rāmāyana, three being well-known, viz. the Southern represented by the Guja rati Press edition in seven parts and the Nir. edition in two parts, the Bengali recension (represented by Gorrecio's edi tion ) and North-western recension represented by the edition of the Rāmāyana published by the D. A. V. College, Lahore in 1923 ff. The Southern recension is the most widely spread of the three. Jacobi found differences in these recen sions and classified them and arrived at the following conclusions :- (1) Each recension differs from both or one of the other two in the common verses, the Southern recension

having the more original text; ( 2 ) each recension has a good number of verses, longer pageages and sometimes whole can tos which are not found in one of the other two recensions or in both the other recensions ; (3) the sequence of the verses is often different in two or sometimes in all three recensions. Jacobi found that in the first 30 cantos of Kişkindhā 749 ver ses were common out of a total of 1303 verses in Southern recension and 1228 in East Bengal recension. Prof. C. Bulcke finds that of the 4202, verses of the N. W. version of Sundara kānda, 31 percent are absent from the Bengal version and 28 percent from the Southern Recension and 13 percent exclu sively belong to the N. W. recension (vide Poona Orientalist, vol. 25 at p. 37) and adds that the narrative changes very little and that the additional verses are often due to repeti tion of laments, consolations and fuller descriptions of events already narrated. He advances the plausible theory that all three recensions were reduced to writing independently on the basis of a text which had been transmitted orally for several centuries by professional singers who had committed the poem to memory. Prof. C. Bulcke (of Allahabad Univer sity ) in his careful paper on the ( three Rāmāyaṇa recensions) examines these divergences in the recensions (in J. O. R., Madras vol. 17 pp. 1-32 ) and arrives at the conclusion that, in spite of the divergeuces the subject matter of the Rāmā yana viz. the narrative itself has been changed very little. He examines 152 cases from the seven kändas and shows, (A) how in some cases the subject matter occurring in the Southern recension is absent from one recension or from both of the other recensions ; (B) the subject matter not found in the Southeru recension is in some cases present in one or both of the other recensions; and lastly (C) there are other differen ces among the tbree recensions which cannot be classified under either A or B. He points out places where entire sar. gas or fairly long passages are not present in all the recen sions even if they do not contain any new subject matter. 

A few striking illustrations of the divergence in the three recensions may be cited here : 

1 In the Bălakānda, the auspicious conjunctions of the planets in certain signs of the Zodiac ( Ráśis ) at the birth of Rāma and his brothers occur in the Southern recension but 

888

i 

are absent in the other two;420 (2) a long poetic description of the Ganges in Ayodhya ( 50. 13-24 ) is absent in the other two recensio 

censions: 13 ) the condemnation of Buddha as nūstiku ( atheist ) and as resembling a thief occurs in Ayodhyā ( chap. 109.34 ) in Southern recension but is absent in Gorrecio's ed. aud the whole chap. is absent in N. W. recension; (4) Two sargas, 62 and 63, of Aranyakāņda (in S. recension ) are absent from both Bengal and N. W. recensions; (5) a group of six sargas (10-15 ) in Yuddha-kānda in S. recension is entirely absent from the Bengali recension and partly from N. W. recension. 

Many of the quotations from the Rāmāyana in medieval digests are not found in the current editions of the epic, e.g. the Dānasagara of Ballālasena, king of Bengal (composed in sake 1091 i.e. 1169-70 A.D.) quotes four verses from the Rāmāyana of which only one is found in the Yuddhakanda (18.30), acc. to Mr. Bhabtosh Bhattacharya in his paper on 

The Rāmāyana and its influence on Ballālasena and Raghu nandana' in J. O. I. ( Baroda ) vol. II (pp. 18-22). Vide Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya's' Studies in Dharmaśāstra' pub lished in 'Indian Studies' (past and present) in 1964, in which he gives a list of verses from Rāmāyana in seven digests (from Danasāgara and others) which can be identified (pp. 53-55) and

another list on pp. 55-56, where verses quoted as from Rāmāyana in the same works cannot be identified. In another paper on the Rāmāyana and its influence upon the medieval digests of Eastern India Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya shows that the early medieval works like the Hāralată of Aniruddha and the three Ratnākaras of Candesvara on Krtya, Grhastha and Vivāda, quote the Rāmāyaṇa sparingly, e. g. Aniruddha quotes only five verses and the Ratnakaras quote only four verses and that it is only the later medieval works such as the three out of the four Kaumudis of Govindananda that quote fourteen verses from the Rāmāyana, most of which are found in all recensions of the Ramayana and the Rajadharmakaus tubha of Anantadeva quotes in all 39 verses from the Rāmā. yana but many of these verses do not tally exactly with the three recensions of the Rāmāyana. 

It should be noted that the Uttarakānda shows no diffe rence worth mentioning. Therefore, it may be assumed that that kānda is not only the work of later interpolators, but it must have been composed after the original poem was bifur. cated into the Southern recension and Northern recension. The Mahabharata narrates the Rama story in Vanaparva (chap. 273-292 ) in about 750 verses. It may be noticed that some of the incidents mentioned in the Uttarakānda occur in the Raghuvamsa of Kālidāsa. For example, Rama's spy called Bhadra was ordered by Rāma on his return to Ayodhyā after the destruction of Rāvana and his forces to report what was talked in the capital and the kingdom by the citizens and other people about himself ( Rāma ), about Sitā and about his brothers (Uttara. chap. 43. 4-6). Then, Bhadra, after repeating what people said about Rāma's ex ploits, stated that people talked disparagingly about taking back Sitā, whom Rāvana had placed on his lap when carrying her away and had imprisoned in the Asokavanikī and that the subjects remarked that they would have to endure, if similar incidents happened in the case of their wives.431 In the 421 अङ्कमारोप्य तु पुरा रावणेन बलाद्धताम् । लङ्कामपि पुरा नीतामशोकवनिका

Raghuvamsa (14.31 ) also the spy is called Bhadra. It is clear that Kalidasa knew the Uttarakānda. The Raghuvamsa in chapter 15 closely follows the Uttarakānda. A few inci dents may be set out. Raghuo. 15. 81-84 may be compared with Uttarakānda 97. 15–17. Compare also Raghu. 15.87-90 with Uttarao chap. 100, Raghu 15. 89-90 with Uttarao chap. 101-102, Raghu, 15. 92-95 with Uttarao 103-5, Raghu 15. 97-98 with Uttarao 107. Kālidāsa in Raghu (14.70) echoes the very words of the Rāmāyana ( Bālakāņda+38 2. 18 and 40). 

It should be noted that at the end of the Yuddhakanda there is a long phaluśruti about the fruits of reading it and there is another at the end of the Uttarakānda also.+23 Besides, the first canto of the Balakānda gives a synopsis of the whole of the Rāmāyaṇa up to Rāma's becoming a king after return ing from his victory over Råvana, in which there is no reference to the subject matter of the Bāla kända or of the Uttarakānda. Then, again, in the 3rd chap. of the Bålakanda there is a summary of events from Rāma's birth up to his abandonment of Sitā. It follows that even at the time of this second table of contents the Uttarakinda had not come up to its present form. Dr. Bulcke is not right when he says (on p. 41 of his paper in Poona Orientalist Vol. XXV) that Laks mana was unmarried as Rāma gays in Aranya-kānda ( 18.3). The learned writer forgets that Rāma was making fun of Sūrpaņakhā who wanted Rima to marry her and therefore he (Rāma who had Sitii with him) jocosely said that Lakomana (unaccompanied by a woman ) was unmarried and that she might approach him. But this was all spoken iu fun, as is made clear by the word 'parihāsūvicalcşanā' applied to Sür panakhã (not clever enough to understand the ridicule and the joke). Balakanda, chap. 73 verses 30-33 specify the names of the wives of Rāma and his brothers and Ayodbyā chap. 118.53 expressly says that Urmilī was married to Lakşmala.

32. The Two Epics 

391 

The Rāma story is frequently alluded to in the extant Mahābhārata. The story of the golden deer424 ( Márica ) whose beautiful skin Sitā longed to have ( Araṇyakānda. chap. 43-44 ) is referred to in the Sabhäarva 76.5. The Vana parva (chapters 147.31 to 148.19 ) summarizes the Rāma story and ends with the verse that Rāma ruled the kingdom for eleven thousand years. This verse occurs in the Rāmā yaņa also ( Yuddha 131.106 ). The Dronaparva (chap. 59 ) describes the excellence of Rāmarājya. The Dronaparva (196. 36 ) compares the death of Drona to the death of Vālin. A large volume would have to be written if one were to deal with all questions relating to the two epics. I hold that there is no doubt that there existed a Bhārata Epic before there was a Rāmāyana ( Vide'the Great Epic of India' by Hopkins, as he says on p. 61 ). Jacobi's German work on the Rāmāyana has been translated into English by Dr. Ghoshal piecemeal in the Volumes of the Journal of the Oriental Institute, Baroda, in vol. V onwards. 

In the Salyaparva (39.9–10 ) reference is made to the cutting of the head of a raksasa by Rāma in Janasthäna. In the Santiparva425 is mentioned the story of the return to life of a brāhmana boy ( who had died prematurely ) when Rāma killed Sambūka, a südra practising peuance. The Sāptiparva speaks of the death of Rāvana at the hands of Rāma who was angered by Rāvana. 426 The Drona parva compares the fight of Ghatotkaca and Alayudha with the fight of Rāma and Ravaya ( 96.27-28 ). 

All verse quotations in the Mahābhāsya are collected in one place by Kielhorn in I. A. vol. 14 the pp. 326-327

History of Dharmaśāstra 

Another question much discussed by some Western scholars is the relation of the Rāmāyaṇa to the Dasarathá jātaka. Reasons of space prevent any detailed discussion. The Dasarathajätaka ( No. 461 in Fausböll's edition, vol. IV) is a travesty of the Rāma story. In it Sitā is a sister of Rāna, Dasaratha is a king of Benares (and not of Ayodhya ) who is said to have had 16000 wives and Sītā ( a sister ) is made queen after Rāma's return from the forest. There is nothing peculiarly Buddhist in it. The Jātakas forma later part of the Pali literature. Rhys Davids in 'Buddbist India 'furnishes a chronological table of Buddhist litera ture from Buddha's times to Asoka and divides it into ten groups of which the Játakas and Dhammapadas form the 7th. The Játakas are not earlier than 250 B. C. and may be later by a century or more. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the germs of most of the JĀtaka stories were derived from the folk-lore of India existing in those times. They are meant to glorify Buddha in his suppo sed previous existences and, while using well-known names, try (probably purposely ) to make these names (except that of the Bodhisattva) ridiculous. For example, the Kanha Dipāyana Jātaka No. 444 ( its prose being in two distinct parts ) makes it clear that none of the traits of the most famous sage of the Mahābhārata can be traced in the Jātaka called after him. The Jātakas generally contain some Gäthās and some prose passages. In a number of Jātakas the prose parts are in conflict with the găthās or have nothing to do with them. The prose parts in their present form belong to 5th cent. A. D. and arose in Ceylon. Jacobi (Das Rāmå yana pp. 84 ff) and Keith (JRAS. 1915 p. 323 ) hold that the prose parts of Jātakas are confused and belong to a later date. Two questions arise viz. (1) Does the Dasarathe jātaka present an older form of the Räma story? (2) Is the Dasaratha Jātaka really older than the Rāmāyana ? Accor ding to the present author the replies to these two questions are in the negative and he agrees with the conclusions of the late Mr. N. B. Utgikar (in JRAS. Centenary Supplement pp. 203-211 ). Vide also the same scholar's paper in LABRAS ( New Series vol. 4 pp. 115–134 ). In most of the Patuks also the stories as told in the Epic differ greatly from the stories labelled under the same name in them.

In the Dasarathajătaka ( No. 461, p. 127 ) occurs a gātha ('phalānam iva pakkānam niccaṁ papatanā bhayam I evam játānām maccānam niccam maranato bhayamil'), which occurs in Gorrecio's edition (vol. II p. 42, verse 4) and is quoted below*** (but does not occur in other editions ). 

Just as in the extant Mahābhārata references are some times made to the Rāma story, so in the extant Rāmāyana occur references to the legends that occur in the Mahābhārata. For example, the story of Savitri (daughter of Asva pati, king of the Madras, and wife of Satyavan, son of Dyumat sena, the blind king of Sälva ) well-known to all Indian women as the paragon of wifely virtue, is described in Vana parva (chap. 293-299), is very briefly mentioned in the Ayodhyakanda, where+18 Rama first expressed his unwilling Dess to allow Sitā to accompany him in his forest exile. It should be noted that the verse speaks of Savitri's story as well-known and does not dilate on any of the incidents connected with that story. It is again referred to in Sun darakānda 24.11. In the Sundarakānda (chap. 24 10-12 ) six pativratus are named among whom Damayanti is the last.458 The story of Nala, king of Nişadha, and his devoted wife Damayanti is one of the longest ākhyānas in the Mahābha rata and is a very charming one. It is set out in the Vana parva, chapters 52-79. Cyavana was a son of Bhrgu. Vana parva (chap. 122-124 ) narrates at some length how Suka nyā, daughter of king Saryāti, had to marry the sage blinded by her through mistake. She stuck to the old and blinded Cyavana, although the Asvins sought her hand. It should be noticed that most of these stories occur in the Mahābhārata

and some (like those of Sāvitrī, Damayanti and Sukanya ) at great length, while the Rāmāyaṇa employs them only for com parison and does not set them out at length. Sagara is referred to in the Rāmāyana (Ayodhyā 36.16 about Asamañja). But no reference is made to his wives. In Vana parva (chap. 106-7) it is stated that Sagara was a descendant of Iksvāku, had two wives, Vaidarbhi and Saibyā, had from Saibyā one son called Asamañja whom he banished because he indulged in the pastime of drowning the children of the subjects (Santi, chap. 57.8-9 ) and Sagara had sixty thousand sons from Vaidarbhi who were all reduced to ashes by Kapila's wrath when they dug the earth, found Aśvamedha horse near sage Kapila and wanted to apprehend Kapila as the thief. The story of Uttarka, a devoted pupil of Gautama, is narrated at length in Advamedhika parva chap. 55-58 and in Vanaparva chap. 132–33. He married the daughter of Gau tama and requested Ahalyā, Gautama's wife, to accept some present as Gurudaksiņā (fee). When Uttanka pressed her to accept something, she asked him to bring the jewelled ear rings of the wife of king Saudása- man-eater ( 56.31 ). He went to Saudāga and begged for the ear-rings of his wife Madayanti. Saudāsa asked him to see his wife and give her his message. A long story is narrated about the ear-rings which she gave. King Janaka held assemblies of learned men for discussion. One bandin (i. e. sūta at his court ) used to argue with learned men, defeated them and plunged them in water. Uddalaka had a pupil Kahoda, who married the daughter of his guru. She conceived and the child in the womb rebuked his father when he committed mistakes in re peating Veda. The father cursed the foetus that he would be defective in eight limbs. Astāvakra defeated bandin and those who had been thrown into water (including Kahoda who had been defeated by Bandin ) were revived by Varuna and then Kahoda recited a verse set out in the note below.480 Yayāti is frequently mentioned for comparison or illustration as in Ayodhyā 5. 10 ( same words in Kişkindhā 17. 9, viz. 'yayātim-iva punyānte devalokād-iba cyutam', also Araṇyeo

The Sundarkānda is regarded by scholars as part of the original epic. Therefore, it is probable that the part of Sun darkāņda which mentions the names of six pativratas, the stories about whom occur at length in the Vanaparva and Ašvamedhika-parva, is probably later than the parvan: (Vana and Asvamedhika ) which are held by several scholars to be later than earlier parvans of the great Epic. 

Nalakūbara is said to have cursed Rāvana when the latter ravished apsaras Rambhā (Vanaparva 280.59-60, Uttara kānda 26. 15 and 41 ff') who had an assignment with Nalakūbara, son of Vaisravana, brother of Rāvana; on hearing about this he cursed Rāvana that his head would be shattered in seven pieces if he dared to ravish any woman. In the Yuddbakānda ( 122. 16 ) it is stated that Dasaratha ( who had died and had gone to heaven ) came in a heavenly car to meet Rāma after his victory over Rāvana and said . You have saved me as the brāhmaṇa Kabola was saved by Astāvakra.' The story of Astávakra, son of Kahoda is narrated in Vana parva chap. 132-4. King Nrga while making gifts of cows to brāhmaṇas, by mistake donated the cow belonging to a brāh mana which had strayed among the cows belonging to the king and when the brāhmana lodged a complaint against the recipient of his cow before the king, the latter did not look into the matter for many days and the two brāhmanas cursed him to be a chameleon. That story is referred to in Apusā. sana 6. 38, Asvamedhika 90. 99-100 and Anusāsana 70 (at length ) and 72. 2. 

Taking the cue from the name Sitā (the heroine of the Rāmāyaṇa ) several scholars have regarded the Rāmāyaṇa as an allegory, the word Sitā being employed twice in the Rgveda (IV. 57.6 and 7) and apostrophized as a goddess.481 Three personages are known to our mythology as Rāma, viz. Jāme dagaya Rāma ( or Parasurama ), Balarāma ( brother of Krsna )

and Dāśarathi Rama. It is unnecessary for the history of Dharmasastra to deal with this question when the Rāmāyaṇa is admitted by all scholars as separated from the Rgveda by at least a thousand years or more. 

It has been stated above that the core of the Rāmāyana story may be only as old as 300-250 B. C. at the most. Asva ghosa432 in his Buddhacarita refers to Vālmīki as writing a poetical work when Cyavana ( his ancestor ) did not do 80. Besides, the Raghuvamsa closely follows the Uttarakānda as shown above. If we accept the date of Kālidāga as between 350 to 450 A. D., then the Ramayana in its present form can not be placed later than about 200 A. D. and may be placed at least a century or two earlier. In the Kiskiudhā-kānda two verses have been expressly quoted as recited by Manu which occur in the present Manu.433 In Ayodhya 107.11-13 two verses are stated to have been uttered by Gaya in Gaya with reference to pitrs.434 

The Rāmāyana being mainly a Kávya is not frequently or profusely quoted by works on Dharmaśāstra, particularly by comparatively earlier ones. Among the early commentators, Medhātithi on Manu IV. 217 refers to the Rāmāyana as pre scribing Srāddha on the 4th, 8th, 9th and 10th days after the death of a person. On Manu V. 7 Medhātithi quotes without naming the Rāmāyana a half verse from it (yadannaḥ puruso

rājan-tadannāstasya devatāḥ ).436 It may be noted that the Dhvanyaloka ( a Kashmirian work on Poetics of the latter half of the 9th century A. D. ) quotes a verse from the Aranya-kanda ( 16. 18 ) as an example where the Vyaigya ( suggested ) sense pushes the literal sense ( vācya ) of the word ( undhu in that verse ) very much in the background (atyanta-tiraskxta-vacya ).438_ In spite of this writers on Sanskrit Poetics rarely quote or refer to it. 

Even Aparărka who quotes the Mahābhārata dozens of times quotes the Raināyana only twice. 437 On Yāj. I. 211 Aparārka quotes & verse saying of one who being able to save a sarunāgatu allows him to die in his presence all merit ( sukrta i.e. punya ) is taken away by the one who is not saved ). On offering water to one's deceased relations Aparārka ( on Yaj. III. 5) quotes a verse from Ayodhyakanda (102-27 ). The Smrticandrika ( I. p. 57 ) quotes Sundara kanda 59, 35-36 about cessation of study on the first tithi of a month (pratipat-phthasilasya vidyevu tanutam gata). The Krtyakalpataru ( on vrata, brahmacāri, tīrtha and naiyata kāla has no verses froin Rämūyana though Naiyata kālikā quotes about two dozen verses from the Mahābhārata). Both epics condemn the king who being engrossed in pleasures does not attend the court of justice when the parties approach him for justice. The Kalpataru on 'grhastha.' quotes only two verses from Ramayana, but it mentions the Mahābhārata

In the Rajanitiratnakara of Candesvara (ed. by K. P. Jayaswal ), verses about the right of the eldest son to succeed to his father are supported by quotations from the Rāmā yana.430 

Indian culture penetrated to Borneo, Java, Bali and other Indonesian islands. In the Rāmāyana, Sugrīva is said to have sent his followers in search of Sitā in the four quarters. He directs them to the countries in the East and names Yavadvīpa (Java) as one of them (in Kiskindhā 40.29-30 ).440 Ptolemy (in his Geography of India about 150 A.D.) refers to it as 

• Jabadien'. It is generally accepted that Java and Sumatra had been Hinduized before the 3rd century A.D.

The Mahābhārata became very popular in Java; the Javanese puppet shows called 'wayang' have preserved the old Hindu traditions even in these days, though Java has been * Moslem country for five centuries. Tantric doctrines also prevailed in Java and Sumatra. The Rāmāyana exists in Bali in the Kavi language. There exist several recensions of the Rāmāyaṇa in Java, both in verse and probe. 

Some incidents of the Rama story are represented in the Javanese · Wayang' (shadow plays ). Dr. Bijan Raj Chatterjee in India and Java' p. 29 states “ In a 6th century inscription of Cambodia we find the following passage with the Rāmā yana and the Purana he (the Brahman Somaśarman ) gave the complete Mahabharata and arranged for a daily recitation without interruption'. About India's influence on architecture in Indonesia Levi writes “In Architecture it is in distant Cambodia and distant Java that we have to look for the two wonders produced by the Indian genius, Angkor and Boro Budur'( q. from Srivijaya 'by Prof. Nilakanta Sastri p. 11 ). 

Two interesting chapters in the two epics are known as Kaccit-praśna' chapters. They are Sabhā-parva chap. 5 verses 17-110 and 114-125 (in all 106 verses ) where the sage Nārada asks Yudhisthira certain questions about what an ideal king is expected to do in all that concerns the Govern ment of the State and the people, and Ayodhyākānda chap.100 verses 76 ( of which the first five are introductory in which Rāma, who was staying on Citrakūta along with Sitã and Lakşmala ), inquires of Bharata about the Government of Ayodhyá after Rāma left.441 In verses 6-10 Rāma asks Bharata about Dasaratha, about the Upādhyāya ( Vasistha ) of the family and about his mother and step-mother; so in the Rāmāyana only 66 verses are properly concerned with the Government of the country, the king's duties and actions and cognate matters, while in the Mahābhārata these matters are

dealt with much more elaborately (in 106 verses ). One in teresting feature of these two chapters is that they contain about twenty-nine identical verses. Sometimes the Rāmā-- yana text is corrupt. Very slight differences of readings are not noted here but only substantial ones. 

The word 'Kaccit' is employed when the person asking the question desires to receive a favourable reply, as the Amarakośa says 'Kaccit kāmapravedane'. The Rāmāyana, employs this word in other passages also as in Balakānda 52. 7-9. The Gitā also employs it in chan. 18. 72 (Srikrona asks ‘Kaccid-ajñāna-sammohaḥ pranastuste Dhanaîjaya' and the reply is 18. 73 nasto mohah, &c'as Krsna desired.

From this analysis it follows that out of 66 verses in which the word lcuccit occurs in the Rāmāyana 29 are almost the same as in Sabhåparva and there also a few half verses, pādas ( quarters of a verse ), which are the same but are not noted here. Another weighty criticism is that at the time when this kaccit chapter is supposed to have been addressed by him to Bharata, Rāma did not know that king Dasaratha was dead. It is after this chapter that Bharata tells Rāma (in chap. 101. 5-6 ) that after Rima left for the forest the king died, being overwhelmed by sorrow. Therefore, some of the questions put in the mouth of Rāma are inappropriate and irrelevant, such as the questions about the honour paid to Upādhyāya, about Purohita, Mantrins, Senāpati and duta. All these high functionaries had been appointed by Dasaratha himself. On the other hand, in the case of Yudhisthira, who was the eldest among the sons of Pandu and who performed the Rājasūya also ( also as described in Sabhā 33 ff ), those questions were appropriate. I think the chapter ( 100 ) of the Ayodhyākānda is based on chap. 5 of the Sabhāparva and about 29 verses were almost bodily taken from the sheet parva into the Ayodhyākānda. 

The Rāmāyana is a Kävya, yet, op account of the mobile ideals that it sets up in the chief characters, it washaper prend

popular and is relied upon as a source in digests on Dharma, though not so frequently and profusely as the Mahābhārata. Vide for example, Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattīcārya's paper on * Rāmāyana and its influence on medieval digests of East India' in Gode com. volume pp. 19-26. The following table will give some idea of the different topics of Dharmaśāstra dwelt upon by the Ramayana. The references are to the Madras one volume edition referred to above (p. 399 n. 441 ). 

Abhiseka-Ayodhyā 15, Yuddha 131. Arājaka-Ayodhyā 67. Pātakas (sins )- Kiskindhā 17-18. Rājadharma-Balakanda 7, Ayodhyā 100, Aranya 6, 9, 33, 

40-41, Yuddha 17, 18, 63. Srāddha-Ayodhyă 76, 103. Satyaprašamsă-Ayodhyī 109. Strīdharma-Ayodhyā 24-27, 29, 39, 117-118. 

It must be stated that whole cantos are unauthorizedly added in some cases in the Rāmāyana e.g. in the Uttarakānda after chap. 23 five surgas ( containing 296 verses ) are added. Five more are added after chap. 37 ( containing 244 verses ) and three cantos are added after chap. 59 ( containing 145 verses ). 

Another matter to be noted is that not only are unautho rized verses added in the Rāmīyana but here and there verses are repeated e.g. several verses in Ayodhyā 105. 4-12 and Yuddha 131. 2-10. It has been already shown that about 29 verses ( with 'kaccit' in them ) have been borrowed from the Mahābhārata. Moreover, several verses are common to both the epics (e. g. vide pp. 385-386 above). 

The claim, put forward in the Balakanda (chap. 2, verses 3-31 ), that Valmiki, on seeing the Krauńca bird killed by a hunter, uttered a verse ( śloka ) that was to be the pattern or model for all succeeding poets composing poems in that matters cannot be admitted as tenable. The Rāmāyana as a K cannot be claimed on the available evidence as earlier things 300-200 B. C. 

32. The Two Epics 

403 

Quotations in the Mahābhâsya lead to the conclusion that, centuries before Patañjali, works in the Sloka metre bad been composed. A few examples quoted below will bear out this.442 

Verses in the Sundarakāndia*4.3 are of great significance on the date of the Ramiyana. Hanūmin is said to have pondered over the question whether he should address Sita in Sanskrit used by Dvijātis ( brālimanas, ksatriyas and vaisyas ) or he should employ sentences used by common men ( vide note below). There is hardly anything to show that about 400 or 500 B. C. there was a vast difference between the languages spoken by higher classes and those spoken by lower classes. But a century or two before and after the Christian era great differences had arisen between the two as indicated by Inscrip tions aud literary works. 

I cannot close this brief section on the Rāmāyaṇa without mentioning a work of outstanding merit viz. •Thirty lectures

on the Rāmāyana' by ths late Right Honourable V. S Srinivasa Sastri ( publisheil by the Madras Sanskrit Academy in 1949). He does not real with the Rāmāyaṇa in the spirit of a critical scholar. Questions of the date of the Rāmāyana, the authorship of it, of the indebtedness of Vālmiki to others and of the authenticity of the present text are left out by him. He deals at great length with the principal characters of the epic and his language is moving, often charged with fervour and emotion and his exposition of the different incidents is masterly. He quotes a very large number of verses from the Rāmāyana. In his exposition he is at his best when he deals with the attack by Rāma against Välin from behind trees and the incident of harsh words Rāma used when he abandoned Sitā after killing Rāvana ( Yuddhakānda, 118, verses 12-24) His words are most eloquent when in the 27th lecture on p. 432 he says 'that is Rāma's greatness that he did not mind sacrificing anything to preserve Dharma. Dharma has many pbases. What he ( Rāma ) thought was his highest Dbarma, that he fulfilled and to that end there was nothing that be would not sacrifice'. It may be pointed out that the Padma purāņa (Anandaśram ed. IV. 66. 28-29 ,444 proclaims in two verses the virtues that the Rāmiyana emphasizes by delineat ing some paragons of virtue such as Rāma, Sitā, Bharata, Laksmana and Hanūmān. 

Though the Rāmāyana is full of poetic passages, it often departs from Panini's grammar. A few examples may be cited; * Kurmi’ ( for karomi ) in Ayodhya 12. 36, 'ānayitum' (for 'ānetum') in Ayodhyā 19. 10 and 'nayisyati ( for ' nesyati') in Ayodhyā 12. 87, 'rusya' Ayodhya 97. 12, Mantrimsca' in Sundarakānda 51. 37 ( for Mantriņasca ). 

The Gujarati Press edition of the Rāmāyana ( in seven parts, 1912-20 ) contains three commentaries. A brief statement on these may be made here. Of the three the earliest seems to be the one called Bhūsana composed by Govindarájan of Kausikagotra. He was a man of profound learning in the various branches of Sanskrit literature. Sometimes his commentary is very extensive ( as on the first verse of the Balakanda ), but sometimes it is the briefest of

the three commentaries ( as on I. 75. 4, 1. 76. 15 ). At the end of the Bălakānda he states that he had acquired fame by his proficiency in the Vedas, Săstras and learned discussions and he had a keen intellect in Sanskrit poems, Alwinkāra ( Poetics ) and the dramatic art. This writer confers different names on his own commentaries on the different kändas viz. Manimanjira, Pitambara, Ratnamekhalā, Muktāhāra, Srngära tilaka, Ratnakiriţa, Manimukuta. It appears that Satakopa of Vatsa-gotra was his guru and he was the son of Varada ( last verse in com. on Yuddhakanda ). At the end of his commentary on Sundarakanda, he states that he looked into several commentaries of former ācāryas. 

As he quotes the KĀvyaprakāśa, the Alankārasarvasva and the Vștta-ratnākura he is certainly later than the 12th century A.D. and most probably flourished in the last quarter of the 15th century. Vide an exhaustive paper on Govinda rāja by the late Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar in A.B.O.R.I. [ Silver Jubilee vol. (1943), pp. 30-54 ). 

The 2nd commentary is called "Rāmāyanusiromani'. The author's name is not clearly stated in the beginning, though at the end of the 7th kānda the concluding verse clearly says 'Sivasalāya-nirinitiresā'. So this commentary was written by Siva-sahāya and he composed the commentary on the banks of the Triveni (Ganges at Allahabad ) with the help of a rich patron called Vamsidhura, sou of Sitārāma, son of Todirama. This commentary also is learned and very extensive on some verses. From the last verse ( 8 ) it appears that the commentary was completed in Sarvat 1921, Asvina sukla 10 (i, e. 1864 A. D.). Thus it is a very modern commentary. 

The third commentary is called Tilaka.445 The concluding verses 448 of the commentary indicate that the commentary was

written by Sri Nāgeśa under the patronage of Rāmavarman, The idea of those two verses appears to be that the import of the Rāmāyana was made clearer by the clearing cloth in the form of the intellect of Rāmavarman. What part other than that of a patron ( who employed an eminent scholar like Nāgeśabhatta ) Rāmavarman played is not quite clear. The opening verses of the commentary on the Bălakānda mention only Rāma as the author. 

The commentary is learned and to the point and does not make an exhibition of the author's wide reading and scholar ship. 

As would be shown later on Nāgeśa (or Nāgojibhatta ) flourished between 1670-1750 A. D. 

Vide Prof. P. P. S. Sastri's paper on The commentators of the Rārnīyana in the 15th to 17th century A. D.'in A. B. O. R. I. (Silver Jubilee vol. 1943, pp. 413-414 ). He mentions the commentators on the Ramayana mostly from South India, as the Vaisnavas in South India looked upon the Rāmāyana as the most sacred work on Visnu wor ship. 

In the Mahābhārata-titparya-nirnaya of Anandatirtha (Sri Madhvācārya, 13th century A. D.), seven chapters (III-IX) are devoted to the Ramayana story. In the first chapter he sets out the authorities. In I. 30447 he refers to the four Vedas vin. Rgveda and others, the Pancurătra system, the Bharata, the Mula-Rāmāyana, and the Brahmasūtra these are regarded as self-sufficient authorities. What does be mean by Mūla-Rāmāyana ? It means nothing else than the Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki. In Sanskrit and the popular langua

ges of India there are numerous works having the Rāmāyaya as part of their names. At the end of chap. IX (verses 125-7)448 the great Acārya says 'through the grace of Visnu he has declared this grand story, by reasoning and by the power of his intellect, after dispelling all contradictions and deciding the truth from all the Purānas, the works on Pancarātra, from the Bhārata, the Vedas and the great Rāmāyana. So here the word Mahārāmāyana is used in the same sense as Mula-Rāmāyana, since in both places ( 1-30 ) and (IX. 125 127 ) it is the sources of the Rāma saya that are spoken of 

Mr. S. N. Tadpatrikar (in ABORI vol. V. pp. 61-68 ) refers to the word ' Mülarāmāyana ' and starts a new theory that the Mülarāmāyana mentioned in I. 30 by Madh vācārya is different from the Mahārāmāyaṇa mentioned by the Acārya himself in IX. 125. The only authority for this is his inter pretation of some words he quotes from the commentary Tilaka. The few words he quotes are not at all clear and do not support what Mr. Tadpatrikar mentions and further the commentator is no authority binding on modern scholars for the meaning of the words employed by the Acārya in the 13th century. 

The Rāmāyaṇa, being a Kávya and an Akhyāna ( as stated in Dānasāgara, Introductory verse, 15, p. 3), it is sparingly quoted in Dharmaśāstra works. Dr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya in his paper on The Rūmayana and its influence on Ballūlasena and Raghunavdana '449 published in J. O. I. ( Baroda ), vol II, pp. 18-22 points out that only one out of

the four verses quoted from the Rāmāyana in the Dānasāgara could be traced in the Yuddhakānda (chap. 18.30 · vinastaḥ ... raksitaḥ ') in the Gujarati Press edition and that none of the four verses could be found in the Bengali editions. In another paper on the Rāmāyana and its infiuence on the medieval digests of Eastern India' in P. K. Gode Commemora tion Volume 1960, pp. 319-326, the same learned writer discus ses the quotations from the Rāmāyana in the Hāralatā, the three Ratnākaras of Candeśvara (on Krtya, Grhastha, and Vivāda), Kaumudis of Govindānanda ( on Dāna, Srāddha ), and the Rājadharma-kaustubha of Anantadeva. The Kalpa taru on Moksa (pp. 25-26 ) quotes some verses from the Rām. Aranyakānda (chap. 6.2 ff) with different readings. The Mahābhārata offers a great contrast in this respect to the Rāmāyaṇa, as hundreds of verses are quoted from it even in the comparatively early commentaries and digests like the Mitākṣarā and the Kalpataru. 

It is impossible to deal with the numerous writings on the Rāmāyana. Jacobi's German work on the Rāmāyana has been translated into English by Dr. S. N. Ghoshal and published by driblets in several volumes of the Journal of Oriental Institute ( Baroda ). Numerous dates have been proposed for the Rāmāyana e. g. the Department of Letters, Vol. 19 ( Calcutta University ) puts down 433 A. D. as its date. The Rāma story occurs frequently in the Mahābhārata e. g. vide Sabhāparva 50. 39, Vanaparva chap. 148-152 (31 verses ), chap. 274-293 ( verses about 769 ); several Purāṇas such as Brahmao, chap. 123 and 154, Padmapurāna ( several times in Pătălakhanda and Uttarakhanda ), Nārada purāna, Bhāgavatapurāna (IX. 10-11 about 82 verses ), Agni purāna (chap. 5-12, verses 189 ). One writer in Preraņā ' monthly for October 1949 says that there are fourteen commentaries on the Rāmāyana.
