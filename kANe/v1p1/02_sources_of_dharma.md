2. Sources of Dharma The Gautamadharmasūtra?? says 'the Veda is the source of dharma and the tradition and practice of those that know it (the Veda ).' So Āpastamba18 says the authority (for the dharmas ) is the consensus of those that know dharma and the Vedas.' Vide also the Vasisthadharma-sūtra 19 (I. 4-6). The Manusmộti20 lays down five different sources of dhurmu “the whole Veda is (the foremost) source of dharma and (next) the tradition and the practice of those that know it (the Veda); and further the usages of virtuous men and self-satisfaction.' Yájña valkya21 declares the sources in a similar strain the Veda, traditional lore, the usages of good men, what is agreeable to one's self and desire born of due deliberation-this is traditionally recognised as the source of dharma.' These passages make it clear that the principal sources of dharma were conceived to be the Vedas, the Smrtis, and customs. The Vedas do not contain

people indulged. in injuring or killing living beings. From the Mababbasya on Vārtika 2 on Paņini 11. 4. 12 it appears that in Patanjali's time there was permanent or aatural opposition or antipathy between Sramanas and brāhmaṇas; 'yeśām ca virodha ityasyāvākāśaḥ śramanabrābmanam'; 'Yeşim ca virodhaḥ śāśvatikah' is Pāņini II, 4, 9, Vide Rhys Davids “ Buddhist India" (ed. of 1950) pp. 192-194 for Asoka's Dhamma to be gathered from his Rock Edicts I, III, VII, IX, XII, and Pillar Edicts 2 and 3. There is not a word 

about God, the soul, about Buddha in these edicts. 17 Et Trialgsi a Fridaltaisit. . 7. 1. 1-2. 18 TÅSAAT: SAN CT29 1 3719. 4. &. I. 1. 1.2. 19 sidfaraiangat usta 1 gota FTZIAR: 981094 fare: GAETHIHII 20 वेदोखिलो धर्ममूलं स्मृतिशीले च तद्विदाम् । आचारश्चैव साधूनामात्मनस्तुष्टिरेवल

positive precepts (vidhis) on matters of dharma in a connected form; but they contain incidental references to various topics that fall under the domain of dharmaśāstra as conceived in later times. Such information to be gathered from the Vedic Litera ture is not quite as meagre as is commonly supposed. In another place22 I have brjught together about fifty Vedic passages that shed a flood of light on marriage, the forms of marriage, the different kinds of sons, adoption of a son, partition, inheritance, śrūddha, strīdhana. To take only a few examples. That brotherless maidens found it difficult to secure husbands is made clear by several Vedic passages. “Like ( a woman) growing old in her parents' house, I pray to thee as Bhaga from the seat common to al123. Vide also Rgveda I. 124, 7, IV. 5. 5 and Atharvaveda I. 17. 1 and Nirukta III. 4-5. These passages constitute the basis of the rules of the Dharmasūtras and the Yājñavalkya smrti against marrying a brotherless maiden24. This bar against marrying a brotherless maiden seems to have been due to the fear that such a girl might be an appointed daughter (putrikū) and that a son born of such a girl would be affiliated to his mother's father. This custom of putrikū is an ancient one and is alluded to in the Rgveda, according to Yāska25. Rgveda X. 85 is a very interesting hymn as regards marriage ; verses from it are used oven to this day in the marriage ritual.26 It shows that in the remote Vedic age the marriage rite resem bled in essence the Brāhma form as described in the Dharma sūtras and Manu.27 But the purchase of a bride (i. e. what is called Asura marriage in later literature ) was not unknown in the Vedic age. A passage of the Maitrāyaniyasainhitā ((I. 10. 11) is referred to in the Vasisthadharmasūtra28 in this con nection, viz. "she who being purchased by the husband'. The

Gāndharva form is hinted at in the words29 .when a bride is fine looking and well adorned, she seeks by herself her friend among men'. The iniportance of the aurasa son was felteven in the remote Vedic ages. “Another ( person ) born of another's loins, though very pleasing, should not be taken, should not be even thought of (as to be taken in adoption30). The Taittiriya-samhita (VI. 3.10.5) propounds the well-known theory of the three debts31. The story of Sunaḥsepa in the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa (VII. 3) suggests that a son could be adopted oven when there was an aurasa son. The Taittiriya-samhita (VII. 1. 8. 1) tells the story of Atri who gavo an only son in adoption to Aurva. The Kşetraja son of the Dharmasūtras is often referred to in the earliest Vedio literaturo. 'What (sacrificer) invites you (Asvins) in his house to a bed as a widow does a brother-in-law or a young damsel her lover '32. The Taittiriya-samhitā makes it clear that a father could distri bute his wealth among his sons during his own life-time, Manu divided his property among his sons' &c.33 Another passage of the same Sahitū seems to suggest that the eldest son took the whole of the father's wealth 'therefore people establish their eldest son with wealth '34. Even in the Vedic ages the son excluded the daughter from inheritance'a son born of the body does not give the paternal wealth to (his ) sister '35. A passage of the Taitti riya-saṁhitā is relied upon by ancient and modern writers on dharmaśāstra for the exclusion of women in general from inheri tance: therefore women being destitute of strength take no portion and speak more weakly than even a low person36.

eulogises the stago of studenthood and the Satapathabrahmana speaks of the duties of the Brahmacarin such as not partaking of wine and offering every evening a samich to fire37. The Taittirlya-samhita (VI. 2. 8.5) relates38 how Indra consigned Yatis to wolves (or dogs) and how Prajāpati prescribed a Prāya scitta for him. The Satapathabrāhmana speaks of the king and the learned brahmana as the upholders of the sacred ordinances.39 The Taittirlyasamhită says 'therefore the Sūdra is not fit for sacrifice'.' The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa tells us that when a king or other worthy guest comes, people offer a bull or a cowti. The Satapatha-brāhmana speaks of Vedic study as yajña and the Taittiriya-aranyakata enumerates the five yajnas, which are a prominent feature of the Manusmrti. The Rgveda eulogises the gifts of a cow, horses, gold and clothes43. Another passage of the Rgveda44 (thou art like a prapī in a desert) is relied upon by Sabara on Jaimini (I. 3. 2) and by Visvarupa on Yajnavalkya as ordaining the maintenance of prapūs (places where water is distributed to travellers). The Rgveda condemns the selfish 

man who only caters for himself 45. 

The foregoing brief discussion will make it clear that the later rules contained in the charmsūtras and other works on olurmuśāstra had their roots deep down in the most ancient Vodic tradition and that the authors of the dharmasūtras were quite justified in looking up to the Vedas as a source of dharma.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

But, as said above, the Vedas do not profess to be formal treatises on dharma; they contain only disconnected statements on the various aspects of dharma ; we have to turn to the smrtis for a formal and connected treatment of the topics of the dharmaśāstra. Vide Prof. S. C. Bannerjee's 'Dharmasūtras, a Study' pp. 514 533 for Vedic passages cited in major Dharmasūtras and pp. 533-539 for references to them by name or by initial word or words. 

Before proceeding further a few preliminary remarks must be made. Ancient Sanskrit writers and modern historians of Sanskrit Literature divide ancient Sanskrit works into three groups, viz. the Vedic Samhitās (Rgveda, Yajurveda, Sama voda and Atharvaveda ), the Brāhmaṇas (including the early Upanişads like the Bșhadāraṇyaka). and Sūtras. The first two groups together constitute Veda or Śruti ( as Sabara says on P. M. S. II. 1. 33 'Mantrās-ca Brāhmaṇam ca Vedah '). Sūtras are not Veda, but many of thom are connected with the Veda and contain numerous mantras. Kalpa is one of the six auxiliary lores (angas) of the Voda and this group is generally later in time than the Brāhmanas, though some sūtra works appear to have been composed even in the times of the Tai. Ār. II. 10 and of the Brhadārangakopanişad (II. 4.10 and IV. 5. 11). A distinction is drawn between Kalpa and Kalpasūtra by tho Tantravārtika.45a The word Kalpa (or rather Kalpasutra) is used in two senses, one comprehensive including tho aphoristic works on Vedic ritual, on the domestic ceremonies and also on law, government and administration of justice; the other sense covers only those aphoristic works that deal with Vedic sacrifices and matters related thereto. If the first sense is taken then Kalpasūtras are classified into three classes, viz. Srautasūtras that deal with solemn Vedic sacrifices, mentioned or discussed in the Vedas and Brāhmanas; (2) Grhyasūtras that deal with domestic ceremonies such as Upanayana, marriage and with daily and periodical rites and employ mantras for them mostly from one Sākhā of the Veda; (3) Dharmasūtras (also depending on the Vedas as the highest authority ) that treat of some of the topics dealt with in the Gșhyasūtras but add provisions on matters .concerning economic life, politics, government, civil and criminal law. A complete Kalpa in the first sense should cover all the three divisions. It is highly doubtful whether gxth Veda

Śåkhā had originally a complete set of the three kinds of works covered under the word Kalpa. This will be briefly dealt with a little below. 

Recently (1959) Dr. Ram Gopal has brought out a large work on 'India of Vedic Kalpasūtras' containing over five hundred closely printed pages. The title of the work is rather misleading. It does not deal with the Srautasūtras beyond very briefly stating what they contain and distinguishing their contents from those of the Gșhya and Dharmasūtras. His work is concerned only with the details gathered from the Gșhya and Dharınasūtras and he has nothing to say about the development of the several topics dealt with in these two classes during the long period of at least 2000 years after the sūtra period (which he places between 800 - 500 B. C. on p. 89). His work should have been entitled "Indian Life as depicted in Gșhya and Dharmasūtras". As far as it goes it is a tolerable thesis, though rather prolix, dogmatic and over-disputatious. Having confined himself to the Gphya and Dharmasütras, it should have been his business to discuss all points concerning at least the principal Gļhya and Dharmasūtras. But he leaves important matters concerning several sūtras untouched. For example, on p. 54 he observes 'many sütras in the Gaut. Dh. S. appear to be of doubtful authenticity and it is an important task for future reseurchers to determine precisely the spurious sūtras interpolated in the original Dharmasūtra'. One feels that he should himself have tackled that task at least about some representative Gșhya sūtras and the Gautama- dharma-sūtra ( which he places on p. 84 among the oldest class of Srauta, Grhya and Dharmasūtras and when on p. 82 he holds that Gautama is undoubtedly the oldest writer on Smārta Dharma) by a thorough examination of chapters and passages in them and should have pointed out the criteria why certain gūtras are held to be spurious and so forth. He need not have included in the thesis the description of the flora and fauna &c. (pp. 103-109) or if he wanted to include these subjects he should have devoted more space. Nor was there any need for him to discuss (as he does on pp. 100-103 ) the varying limits of Aryavarta, since that subject had been dealt with at length by me in H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 11-16. Ho hardly adds anything substantial to what I stated on that topic twenty two years ago. He could have referred to Vol. II of H. Dh, pp. 11-16 and added bits of information that did not getur therein.
