62. Bhāruci The Mit. on Yij. (I. 81) says that Bhiruci like Visvaripa held the view that the rulertau bhüryam gacchet' was a niyanma and not a paristkrinkhayti. On Yij. II 124 the Mit. says that the explanation of' the fourth share' to be given to un married sisters oflered by Asahiya and Medhitithi was the

proper one and not that of Bhāruci. The Parāśaramadhaviya736 and the Sarasvativilāsa ( para 133 ) inform us that Bharuci was of opinion that unmarried sisters were only entitled to a provision for their marriage and were not entitled to a fourth share. 

The Smrticandrikā ( on Vyavahāra p. 268 ) holds that the Visuudharmasūtra (chap. 18 ) and Yāj. II. 124 ( bhagi nyusca...dattvamsam tu turīyakam ) not to be taken literally but all that is meant is that provision has to be made for the marriage expenses of the unmarried sisters of the sons taking the paternal wealth. The Par. M. (III. p. 510 ) notes that this was the view of Bhāruci (as against Medhātithi and Vijñānesvara and also of the Smrticandrikā ). 

Vide Dr. T. R. Chintamani's paper on 'Bhāruci' (in the Pro. of All India Or. Conf. ut Benares in 1943-44, vol. II, pp. 352-360, where he first collects 50 passages of Bhāruci found in the Sarasvativilăsa, then puts together passages where Medhatithi refers to the views of Upadhyāya and then refers to a fragment of Manusmrti commentary (on chapters VI to XII) where some colophons read Rjuvimalā and others Bhāruci. 

Bhāruci, being mentioned by the Mit., is certainly older than 1050 A. D. Rāmānujăcărya, in his Vedārthasamgraba ( reprint from the Pandit, ed. of 1924, p. 154 ), mentions six ācāryas that preceded him as expounders of the Visistādvaita system, viz. Bodhāyana, Tanka, Dramida, Guhadeva, Ka pardin and Bhāruci. Similarly, the Yatindramatadipikā787 of Srinivāsadāsa (Anandāśrama ed.) enumerates (p. 2) a host of teachers as the predecessors of Rāmānujācārya in propound ing the Visistādvaita system. Vyāsa is the reputed author of the Vedāntasūtras, Bodhāyana is said to have composed a vrtti on the Vedānta-sūtras called Kștakoţi according to the

Prapanca-hrdaya ( p. 39, Trivandrum ed.). Tanka and Bra hmānandin are identical. Dramida is credited with the author ship of a bhāsya on the Vedānta-sūtras ( which is quoted by Rāmānuja in his bhāşya on II. 2. 3). Nāthamuni is said to have been the grand-father of Yāmunamuni, who was born about 916 A. D. Rāmānuja refers to him with great reverence as his teacher's teacher (parama-quru), vide Vedārtha samgraha, (p. 149 ) and is said to have been young when Yamuna died ( vide J. R. A S. for 1915, p. 147 and I. A. for 1909, p. 129). It is therefore obvious that the teachers are arranged by the Yatindramatadipikā in chronological order. Hence Bhāruci, being placed earlier than even Dramida and Nāthamuni, was comparatively an ancient author and could not have flourished later than the first half of the 9th century. Bhāruci, the jurist, also flourished before 1050. It is difficult to believe that there were two famous writers of the same name nearly about the same time. Hence it may provisionally be held that Bhāruci the writer on dharmaśāstra and Bhāruci the Višistādvaita philosopher are identical. If this identity be accepted, then Bhāruci the writer on dharmaśāstra becomes comparatively an early writer, being at least as old as Visva rũpa. His views agree on several points with those of Visva rūpa, which is a circumstance that lends some corroboration to the date proposed for him. 

One interesting point about Bhāruci deserves mention here. From pumerous notices contained in the Sarasvativilāga it appears that Bhāruci either commented upon the Visņu dharmasūtra or wrote some work in which he took great pains to incorporate explanations of several sūtras of Visņu. For example, para 637 tells us that Bharuci explained the word' bija' occurring in a sutra of Vişņu as `pinda '.738 In para 674 we are told that Bhāruci explained the word 

niskārana' in a sutra of Visnu and that he held that a daughter's son has not to perform the sraddha of his maternal grandfather if the latter has a son. Sudarsanācārya in his comment upon Apastam bagshya ( 8. 21. 2 ) ascribes the same

view to Bharuci and quotes the very words of Bhāruci.739 Vide J BBRAS for 1925 pp. 210-211 for further examples. There is nothing unnatural in Bharuci, the Visistādvaita philosopher, having composed a commentary on the Visnu dharmasútra. The extant Visnulharmasītra contains doctri nes peculiar to the Višistādvaita system such as the worship of Nārāyana or Vásudeva, the four Vyuhas of Vasudeva &c. If Bhāruci was a Višistñilvaitin he would naturally turn to the sūtra of Visnu as having the greatest claim on his atten tion. Many of the sutras of Vislu quoted in the Sarasvati vilása with the explanations of Bharuci are not found in the printed text of Visnu, on which Nandapandita commented in the first half of the 17th century. It appears that the Sarasvativilāsa haid before it a larger version of Visnu current in the South ( vide note 118 p. 127 above ). 

On several points there is divergence between the views of Bhāruci and those of the Mit. Bhäruci differed from the Mit. as to the definition of düyco and vibhāgu, he allowed niyoga to childless widows, while the Mit. condemned it in the case of all widows; Bharuci, like Visvarūpa, did not men tion supratibundlove and apratibuındar dayco; Bhāruci, like Visvarūpa, held that a coparcener who concealed some joint property was not guilty of theft, while the Mit. held that he was. Vide J BBRA S for 1925 pp. 211-13 for more examples and details. 

Prof. T. R. Chintamani submitted an important paper at the Benares Session of the All India 0. Conf. (in 1943-4) which is published in the proceedings, Vol. II pp. 352-360, wherein he informed scholars that at Trivandrum exists a ms. containiny a fragment of Bhāruci's commentary on Manu called ( Manuśāstra-vivarana ) on Adhyāya VI ( almost from the beginning ), on adhyāyas VII-XI and on a portion of

Derrett740 ( recently contributed a paper to the Journal of the American Oriental Society (Vol. 84 for 1964 pp. 392-395) on · Blauci on royal regulative power in India', based on Bharuci's explanation of Manu VII. 13; and another paper in 2. 1), M. G. Vol 115 pp. 134–152 ( where on pp. 141-151 he arranges in three parallel columns parts of Bharuci's commentary and Melhätithi's Bhāsya on Manu VII. 50, 54, 147, 153, 154, with parallel passages from Kautilya's Arthaśāstra and on p. 144 of his paper compares only Bharuci aud Medhătithi on Manu VII. 52. Dr, Derrett holds (pp. 139-40 of his paper ) that Bharuci is nearer A. D. 700 than the period 800-850 which was assigned to Bhāruci in the H. of Dh. Vol. I. 1930 ) p. 265. Dr. Derrett holds (p. 138 of the paper ) that the passages which Medhătithi takes without acknowledgement froin Kautilya are not obtained from the Arthaśāstra direct, but from Bharucin, who is quoting from Kautilya with occasional udjustments, that Medhātithi did not know that he was reproducing the Arthaśāstra, that the Ms. used by Medhătithi was lefective, that in some places he could not read it. 

What Manu VII. 13741 means is: there are several desirable matters ( istenu ), but the king might decide (or resolve ) to strictly enforce one of them. In that case that matter becomes a rule of Dharma. The same applies to cther matters that are undesirable (anistenu) but the king may resolve to put down with a strong hand one undesirable matter out of many. That would then become the rule of the realm and it has to be obeyed by all. Bhūruci's exegesis comes to this that the king is not the source of the rules of Dlarına, but it is Sāstra that defines the rules binding on the different varnas (classes) and

áśramas ( stages of man's life ). If the king were held to be the source of Dharma and adharma there would be great con fusion; one king may make certain rules, while his successor might abrogate them and promulgate other and different rules. He further says that the kivg often times repeats what the Sastra states ( bizhukřtvas-taduktih ) and that opposing the dicta of Sāstra would be wrong and moreover one should hold that this text only extols the king's office as the context shows. 

In the edition of Mandlik on Manu VIII. 150, Medhãtithi explains that that verse, according to some great ones was explained (iti mahattarair-vyākhyātam ) and immediately afterwards sets out the differing view of Yajvan and on Manu VIII. 151, Medhătithi mentions the explanation of Rju. Dr. Derrett (in footnote 20 on p. 141 of his paper in 2. D. M. G. ) puts forward the suggestion that Yajvan ought to be taken as standing for Rju and that Bhāruci is Rju. In the present state of our knowledge I cannot agree to this sugges tion. From Medhătithi's bhâsya on Manu II. 6743 ( which is a very long one, occupying more than seven printed pages ) it appears that there were many persons designated by Medhā tithi as 'Smộtivivarana karah' as the quotation cited below will show. On Manu II. 25 he refers to the exegesis of Vivaranakāras that Dharma has five aspects (pañcaprakāro dharma iti Vivaranakarāh prapancayanti). It is clear from the parallel passages cited by Dr. Derrett on pp. 141-151 that there is remarkable agreement between the explanation of Bhāruci and of Medhātithi and that probably it is Medhătithi that borrows. But one's judgment may be suspended till the
