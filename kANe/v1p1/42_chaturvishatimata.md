In the Govt. Mss. library at the B. O. R. Institute (Poona), there is a Ms. bearing No. 111 of 1895-1902 of Caturvimsati mata which contains 526 verses and another No. 244 of A. 1881-82 which has 525 verses. 

The work often quotes the views of Uśanas, Manu, Pārāśarya, Angiras, Yama, Hārita. It quotes Manu III. 5 ( ' asapindi. ca ya.' etc.) and Manu XII. 95 (ya vedabahyah smṛtayah). Two other verges which it contains are indicated as interpolated in several editions of Manu.586 It says that the teachings of Arhat, Cārvāka and Buddha delude people. 588 Its position is that whatever is not found in the Veda or the Puranas, the Rāmāyana, or Mahābhārata or in the sāstras of Manu and others is as good as non-existent. 687 

The Caturviṇsatimata is frequently quoted by the Mit., A parārka and later work8,688 but not by Viśvarūpa and

Medhātithi. It was probably compiled about the time when the latter two writers flourished. Aparārka 589 (p. 1121 ) quotes a prose passage from the work on the prayascitta for a dvijāti procreating children on a Sūdra wife. This passage could not be traced in the two mss. referred to above. 

The Mit. on Yāj. III. 58 quotes the Caturo for the proposition that a person resorting to the 4th āśrama (i.e. Sannyāsa ) may be 'ekadaṇdin' or 'tridandin'. The Mit. quotes several verses from the Caturo on penances (prayas cittas ) for serious and light sins or offences. It suggests alternative penances for even very heinous sins, e. g. on Yāj. III. 308 it provides that if a person performs the Japa of Gāyatrī (Rg. III. 62. 10 tat-savitur-varenyaṁ ) a crore of times he atones for the sin of brāhmana murder, becomes free from the sin of drinking liquor by japa of Gāyatrī 80 lakhs of times, from the sin of the theft of gold by repeat ing 70 lakhs of times the Gāyatri. The Smrti-candrikā quotes Caturo many times on Ahnika and on Sraddha. It quotes the opinion of Baudhāyana in a verse and goes so far as to say that a man becomes free from sins by the japa of Brāhmaṇa works, the six angas, the ākhyānas ( legends ), Itihāsa, Purālas and praises of gods and expositions on Dharma. Aparārka also quotes about 60 verses of Caturvimsatimata and one proge passage on p. 1121 ( quoted below ). 

Anothor somewhat remarkable point is that A parārka in several cases places Caturvimsatimata passages immediate ly near Şat-trimsatmata passages (vide Aparārka pp. 1081, 1172–74, 1182, 1248 ). 

The portions of the works on saṇskāra and sraddha together with the commentary of Bhattoji, son of Lakṣmidhara, have been published in the Benares Sanskrit

Series ( Nos. 137 and 139 ). The commentary is a very learned one and refers to a host of writers. This commentary is in some mss. ascribed to Ramacandra ( vide I. O. Cat. No. 1554, p. 473).
