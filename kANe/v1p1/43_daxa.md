43. Daksa 

Dakṣa is one of the writers on dharma enumerated by Yāj. Vigvarūpa quotes verses of Daksa several times, viz. on Yāj. 1. 17 (on clods of earth for purifying the body ), on Yāj. III. 30 (two verses on āśauca ), on Yāj. III. 66 ( about & parivrājaka ), on Yāj. III. 191 (about padmāsada ). The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 89) quotes a half verse of Daksa to the effect that a dvija should not remain unattached to an asrama (i. e. without a wife in the context ) even for a moment; on Yāj. III. 58 two verses about bhikṣus; on Yāj. III. 243 (one verse ). Aparārka cites numerous verses of Dakṣa on ācāra, āśauca, srāddha and similar topics. In one case (p. 368 ) be attributes a prose passage to Dakṣa about the gift of gold.500 Two of Daksa's verses most frequently quoted by writers on vyavahāra are those that lay down wbat nine things cannot be the subjects of gift.601 

In Jivananda's collection there is a Daksasmṛti (part II, pp. 383-402 ) in seven chapters and 220 verses (vide also Anandāsrama collection pp. 72--84), M. N. Dutt's collection Vol. I. pp. 291-309. The principal subjects treated of are : Four asramas, two kinds of brahmacūrins; the daily round of duties for dvijas; various subdivisions of actions, nine karnans vine vikarmang nine actions that should be concealed, nine acts that should be made public, nine things that should not be gifted; gifts; eulogy of a good housewife; sauca of two kinds; impurity due to birth and death ; Yoga and its six angas viz. prāụāyāma, dhyāna, pratyāhāra, dhāranā, tarka and gamādbi; maithuna of eight kinds to be avoided by ascetics ; duties of bhikṣu, dvaita, and advaita.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

Dakṣasmrti contains the name of Daksa himself and shows that he was a thorough-going Advaitin (as the note shows ).582 

This smrti is certainly a very old one. All the quota tions from Daksa cited by Visvarūpa occur in the printed Daksa (vide pp. 395, 396, 384, 397 which reads 'na pathyā sanād yogo'). Similarly all the quotations in the Mit. from Daksa are found in the Calcutta text. Aparārka contains over forty verses from the printed Dakṣa, though there are a few verses cited by him as Dakṣa’s which are not found therein. The Smṛticandrikā quotes about ten verses of Dakśa on woman which are all found in the 4th chap. of the Calcutta text. 

In the Govt. Mos. library at the B. O. R. Institute Poona, there is a ms. of Daksa (No. 120 of 1895–1902), which contains 197 verses on the same topics as above, many of which are identical with the Calcutta text. The Bombay University has also a similar ms. Vide I. O. Cat. No. 1320 p. 385 for a similar ms. in 197 verses.
