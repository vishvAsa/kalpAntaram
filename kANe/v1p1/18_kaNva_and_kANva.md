18. Karva and Känva

18. Kanya and Känva From the Ap. Dh. S. it appears that Kanva and Kāụva were two distinct writers on dharma. In I. 6. 19. 2 Āpastamba starts the question as to the persons, food at whose house was permitted. He states various views on that point and says that Kanya was of opinion that food may be taken at anybody's house provided the latter offered it with a request (I. 6. 19. 3) and that the opinion of Eka, Kuņika, Kānva, Kutsa and Puskarasäili (1. 6. 19. 7) was that only that food that was offered by a pure and religious man should be partaken. In another place ( L. 10. 28. 1) Apastambé gives it as the opinion of Kautsa, Härīta, Kajıva and Puskara sādi that a man became a thief if in any case whatever he appropriates another's belongings. The Kumbhakonam edition of Pandit Halasyanatha reads Kāņva for Kanva. 

Kanva is quoted a few times in the Smyticandrika on Ahnika ( daily duties ) and śrāddha. One of these quotations is in prose ( I. p. 97 ).252 Haradatta in his commentary on Gautama cites verses of Kanva in several places (e. g. Guu tama Dh. S, 21. 3, 23. 3 and 11 ).253 The first verse bears & close resemblance to Manu XI. 180 and Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 62. Kanva is quoted in the Acaramayukha and the Srāddha mayūkha. 

The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 58 ) quotes a verse of Kūņva on the length of the stay of a saimyāsin in a village or town. On Yāj. I11. 260 the Mit. quotes a verse of Kanva stating the prāyascitta for a brālimana having intercourse with the kșatriya wise of his teacher. 

In the Madras Govt. Oriental Library there is a mo. of Kanva (vol. V, p. 1929 No. 2624 ). 

Maskarin on Gaut. Dh. S. frequently quotes passages from Kanva (in prose and verse); vide on I. 33 and 39 ( both prose), V. 21 (prose definition of Vedapāraga ), IX. 1 (prose), X. 53 (verse on five kinds of bräddhas, nitya, naimittika,
