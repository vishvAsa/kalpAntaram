The Anuśnsanaparva ( 18.38 ) states that Garga acquired on the banks of the Sarasvati astronomy with its 64 angas. In the same parure it is said that vrddha-Gārgya inquired about vrgotsarga ( 125. 77 ff). Salya parva ( 37. 14-15 ) narra tes that oli Garya by his tapis acquired on the sacred Sara svatī knowledge of Kāla, movements of the planets, of evil and good ut pātas and that the place is therefore called Gargasrotas. This astronomer Garva is probably different from the Dharma sāstra writer Garga. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 591-92, 741 42, 765 for Garga, the astronomer. Visvarūpa on Yāj: 1. 25 quotes a verse of Gārgya on the proper times for morning Sundhyā and evening Sandhya and a prose passage of Vrddha Gārgya on Yij. I. 195 (p. 136 ). 

21. Cyavana Cyavana is a famous name in the Rgveda. The Asvins are often praised as having endowed the old and aging Cya vana with youth (vide Rg. 1. 117. 13, 1. 118. 6, VII. 71. 5, X. 39. 4). The Mahabharata spins certain stories on Cyavana in Adiparva, chap. 6 and 8, Vanaparva chap. 122-124, Āýva medhika 10. 32. He married Sukanya, daughter of king Saryāti, and the Asvins made him young and handsome. He theu helpeil the Asvips to get a share in Soma offerings after paralysing the arm of Indra who at first opposed this.

I. 207 ) about the proce dure of making the gift of a cow (when on the point of giving birth to a calf) and about the inientras to be recited in that ceremony. The Mit. (ou Yiij.
