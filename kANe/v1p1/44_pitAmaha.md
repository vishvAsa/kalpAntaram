44. Pitāmaha 

Pitāmaba is enumerated among writers on dharma in a verse of VỊddha-Yājsavalkya quoted by Visvarūpa. The Smrti of Pitāmaha (part I p. 10) is drawn upon mostly on Vyavabāra. Visvarūpa cites (on Yaj. I. 17 ) & verse from him on sauca.603 The Mitākṣarā and Aparārka respective ly quote about 45 and 75 verses from Pitāmaba only on Vyavabāra and specially on ordeals and the Kalpataru on Vyavahāra quotes about 90 verses on the same topics from Pitāmaha. Some verses are ascribed to both Pitāmaha and Nārada (as in Kalpataru Vy. pp. 238, 239) and in a few cases to Bșhaspati and Pitāmaba (as in Kalpataru, Vy. p. 251 ). The Smộticandrikā quotes about ten verses (of Pito ) on āhnika, 130 on Vyavahāra and only a few on srāddha. Pitāmaha regards the Vedas with the angas, Mimāṁsā, the

Smrtis, Purana and Nyaya system as dharmasastras.584 Pitāmaha, like Bșhaspati, enumerates nine kinds of ordeals,886 while Yāj. and Nārada name only five, though the latter seems to have known two more, viz. tandula and taptamāsa. The Smsticandrikā quotes a dozen verges about 50 chalas on which a king took action without any complaint.588 Pitāmaha seems to have followed Vyāsa in defining documents called krayapatra, sthitipatra, samdhipatra, visuddhipatra.sor The Smộticandrikā cites Pitāmaha for an enumeration of the 18 pralertis viz. washerman, leather worker, etc.be8 The same work states that according to Pitāmaha the titles of law to be taken cognisance by the king himself were twenty-two. In the hall of justice, he says, there should be eight consti tuents viz. the scribe, the accountant, astra, the sadhya. pāla, the assessors, gold, fire and water. 888 Some of the other noteworthy dicta of Pitāmaha are :- a suit should beooo first tried before the village ( pancāyat), then before the town (court of appeal ), then before the king ; between litigants of the same country, town, societies, cities and villages, the decision should be arrived at according to their own peculiar conventions and usages, but when there is a dispute between these and strangers, the decision must be

according to the śāstru; possession in order to be recognised by the courts as decisive must have five characteristics,sol it must have title, long duration, it must be uninterrupted, it must not have been impeached and it must be before the eyes of the opponent; & private document602 under one's own hand is inferior to a jānapada (a publicly written and attested ) deed, the latter is inferior to a royal edict, this last is inferior to possession continued for three generations. 

Pitāmaha is later than Bphaspati,603 as he cites the latter's view that a litigation between members of the same village, society, town, guild, caravan or army must be decided according to their peculiar usages. Therefore, Pitāmaha must be assigned to some date between the 4th and 7th century A. D.
