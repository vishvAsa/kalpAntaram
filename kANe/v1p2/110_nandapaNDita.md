110. Nandapandita Nandapandita was a voluminous writer on dharmaśāstra. An account of his principal works on dharmaśāstra is given below, particularly because most of them are yet unpublished. He was also called Vināyaka as stated in his commentary ( named Suddhi-candrika) on the Sadasiti (also called Aśaucanirṇaya ) of Aditya of the Kausika-gotra. Nandapandita came of the Dharmādhikari family of Benares and is described as the son of Dharmadhikāri Ramapandita. There were several families in Benares famous for their learned works on Dharmaśāstra and other branches such as the Bhātta family (to which belonged Bhattanārāyaṇa, Kamalākara and Nilakantha ), the Dharmādhi kāri family and the Sesa family. This last had Sesakssa, his son Viśveśvara, whose three pupils viz. Jagannathapandita, Bhattoji Dikșita and Anṇambhatta, author of Tarkasangraha, distinguished themselves as great scholars in their own special studies, 

He composed a commentary called Vidvanmanoharā on the Parāśarasmsti. He expressly mentions therein that he follows the commentary of Madhavācārya.1331 This commentary is referred to in his Vaijayanti. 1382 

He also appears to have written a commentary called Pramitākṣarā or Pratītākṣarā on the Mitākṣarā of Vijñāneśvara 1383 This commentary was probably not completed, as only fragments are found with his descendants. 

Nandapandita also composed a work called Sraddhakalpalata, which is referred to in his Suddhicandrika 384 and in the Vaija

yanti. In this work1885 he refers to a city called Sadharana (probably modern Saharanpur ) where the Sahagila family ruled. He speaks of Simhamalla, Vasāvana, Rupacandra, Bhūpacandra and Paramānanda as successive members of the dynasty and says that he was urged to write the work by the last of them and that he relies upon the Sraddhadipikā of Govindapandita.1388 At the end of the ms. of the Vaijayanti in the Deccan College Collection it is said that the Vidvanmanoharā, the Smrtisindhu and the Śrāddbakalpalatā were the commentaries composed by Nanda pandita.1387 But from the contents given in the India Office Catalogue it does not appear that the work was a commentary. It is divided into five stabakas and deals with the usual topics, viz. what is śrāddha, the proper time and place for it, the proper brāhmaṇas, various kinds of sraddhas &c. The principal authors and works named therein are given below.1388 The Śrāddha kalpalatā was published in the Chowkhamba S. Series (1935) in 262 pages. In Poona Orientalist (vol. 15 pp. 60-64) Dr. S. L. Katre shows that a ms, of the Sraddhakalpalatā is dated in Samvat 1641 (i. e. 1584-85 A. D.). The same scholar shows (in I. H. Q. vol. 28 for 1952, pp. 91 ff.) that a ms. of Suddhi candrikā (which mentions the Sraddhakalpalatā at least five times ) was copied in Saivat 196), Srāvana-vadi (i. e. in July 1603 A. D.). Therefore Śrāddhakalpalatā must have been composed several years earlier than 1603 A. D. 

The Suddhicandrikā of Nandapandita on the Șadasiṭi of Ad ityācārya has been published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit Series of Benares ( 1928 ).1389 The Suddhicandrikā, a commentary on the

Şadasiti or āśaucanirnaya of Kausikāditya, is also one of the works of Nandapandita. It is referred to in his Vaijayanti.1390 The Bhadkamkar collection made by Prof. Velankar contains a ms. of this work and it has recently been published in the Chow khamba Sanskrit Series. The principal authors and works quoted therein are noted below.13 

Another work of Nandapandita is the Smṛtisindhu, which seems to have been an extensive digest of smrti material. Portions of it have been recovered. In the Deccan College Colle ction there is a ms. of the Sa.iskāra-nirnayataranga of the Smrtisindhu, which, according to a verse at the end, was composed by Nandapandita at the command of king Harivamsa-varman of the Mahendra family and son of king Maigo.1393 

It appears that he compiled a summary of the doctrines of his work Smrtisindhu. That summary was called Tattvamuktā. vali.1393 It is almost certain that the fragment of the Tattva 

muktavali noticed in the BBRAS Cat. at p. 217 is a part of this work. That fragment contains 8 verses on upakarma and three on holikā with commentary and the verses are numbered from 

(Continued from the previous page) 86 ascribed to कौशिकादित्य and 56 to गोभिल. This Ms. has at end the verse : धर्माधिकारिकुलकैरवकाननेन्दु--श्रीरामपण्डितसुतेन विनायकेन । याकारि शुद्धिपदपूर्वकचन्द्रिका तां विद्वच्चकोरनिवहाः परिशीलयन्तु ॥ The शुद्धि चन्द्रिका mentions, among other work and authors, धर्मप्रदीप, धर्म

557 to 564 and then 607-609. If the above surmise be correct, the work was a large one and contained over 610 verses. Two of the verses name Hemādri and Pārijāta. 1394 

A few words may be said there about the edition of Nanda pandita's commentary Vaijayanti on the Viṣnusmṛti published (in 1960 ) at Adyar ( in its library series ). It is in two volumes containing 1070 pages in all. The text and com. are printed in beautiful type at the Vasant Press, the Theosophical Society of Adyar. There is a preface ( 4 pages ), Introduction (pp. IX-XXVII) by Pandit V. Krishnamacharya, also a Bibliography, 100 chapters of the Viṣnudharmaśāstra, the text of the Smsti in large and beautiful type, the commentary Vaijayanti in a smaller but clear type, several Indexes, viz. alphabetical index of the sūtras of Viṣnusmṛti, an Index of the words occurring in the sūtras, an Index of the mantras cited in the Viṣnusmrti, an Index of the authors and works cited in the commentary; an Index of the texts cited as authorities in the Vaijayanti (pp. 952-1667); Addenda and Corrigenda (two pages ). In this work he refers to a Brāhmaṇa dynasty of the Vasistha gotra at Vijayapura (Vijayanagara ?) in Karpaṭa country, in which was born Konda panāyaka, whose son was Kesavanayaka, whose son was Ananta alias Vāvarasa, whose sons were Kesava and Rudra. Keśava, son of Kondapa, seems to have gone to Benares with his sons and grand sons and made extensive gifts of all kinds.1395 There is a hyper bolical description of his great gifts ( mahādānas including tula, i. e. weighing against gold or silver). In verses 76-77 of the printed edition of Vaijayanti, Keśavanāyaka enjoined upon Nandapandita the task of composing a commentary on the Viṣnusmṛti. 1396 In the colophons at the end of the chapters of Viṣnu, Kondapanāyaka is styled Mahārājādhiraja and it is said that Nandapandita was encouraged in the task by Kesavanayaka alias Tammananayaka.

At the end of chapter 101, we are told that Keśavanāyaka, Nandapandita's patron, secured mokṣa by breathing his last on the Manikarnikā in Benares. 1397 There are six verses at the end one of which says that in the Kali age there is no one more liberal than Vāvarasa (a son of Kesavanāyaka ) and no one more learned than Nandapandita. 1398 As he wrote on the encouragement of Kesava, the commentary is also styled Keśava Vaijayanti. Among the authors and works mentioned in this commentary are Devasvāmi, Budhasmsti, Bhavadeva, Mādhava carya, Vācaspati, Sarvajña, Subodhini (com. on the Mit. ), Hara datta, Hemādri. In the Vaijayanti he refers to no less than six of his works viz: the Vidvan-manoharā, the Pramitākṣarā, the Śrāddhakalpalatā, the Suddhicandrikā, the Dattaka-mimamsā (vide note 1382 above). But in the Dattaka-mimāṁsā itself he refers to his Kesava-Vaijayanti as already composed.1399 There fore it follows that both works were probably being composed at the same time. The Vaijayanti was held by the British Indian Courts as one of the leading authorities of the Benares School of modern Hindu Law.1400 

Nandapandita, though he generally follows the Mitāksarā, was not a slavish admirer of Vijñāneśvara. He does not accept the explanation the Mitāksarā gives of Yāj. II. 17 (sākṣiṣūbha yataḥ etc. ). Similarly on Viṣnu 8. 12, 22. 41, 23. 11, 27. 2 he emphatically says that the Mitākṣarā is wrong. 1401 He prefers the father to the mother as an heir (on Viṣnu 17. 6-7) and seems to have placed the paternal grandmother as an heir after the mother

but before the brother (folio 101 b). He explains sapinda relationship in the same way as the Mit.1402 does. He says that the word 'bhrātaraḥ' in Yaj. should be explained as standing for ' brothers and sisters' and that in the father's line, after the brother and brother's son, the brother's grandson succeeds and, on failure of the brother's grandson, the paternal grandfather, his son and grandson are heirs one after another, i. e. in each line three generations succeed and then there is a devolution in favour of the next higher line. This view is opposed to that of the Subodhinj and the Smsticandrikā, which take only the son and grandson of each paternal ancestor. Vide my notes to the Vyavahāramayukha for fuller details (pp. 253-254). Nanda pandita stands alone among modern nibandhukāras in having recognised a uterine brother1403 (i. e. the son of the same mother but of a different father) as an heir. It is remarkable that Nandapandita preferred a person's predeceased son's widow (i. e. widowed daughter-in-law) as an heir to that man's own daughter.1404 

The Dattaka-mimāṁsā is the most famous work of Nanda pandita. It was translated very early by Sutherland in 1821 A. D. (comprised in Stoke's Hindu Law Books). In the following the edition of Bharatacandra Siromani (published in 1885 with

on विष्णु 22.5 (folio 124 a). The Mit. on Yaj. I. 52 says: सपिण्डता च एकशरीरावयवान्वयेन भवति ।... एवं यत्र यत्र सपिण्डशब्दस्तत्र

his own commentary) has been used. In this work he lays down rules as to the person who may adopt, when he may adopt, who can give in adoption, who may be adopted, the motives of adoption, the necessary ceremonies of adoptions, the results of adoption. Among the authors and works qouted or referred to, those mentioned below may be noted. 1405 

The Anandashram Press of Poona brought out (in 1941 A. D.) an edition of the Dattakamīmāṁsā with a modern Sanskrit commentary called Mañjari by Saṅkara, son of Ranganātha. 

From very early days of the British rule in India the Dattaka mimāṁsā came to be regarded as the standard work on adoption. In Collector of Madura v. Mootoo Ramalinga 408 the Privy Council says “Again of the Dattakamimamsā of Nandapandita and the Dattakacandrikā of Devap abhatta, two treatises on the particular subject of adoption, Sir William Macnaghten says that they are respected all over India; but that, when they differ, the doctrine of the latter is adhered to in Bengal and by the southern jurists, while the former is held to be the infallible guide in the provinces of Mithila and Benares." That this estimate is some what too strongly put has been said by the Privy Council itself in Bhagwansingh v. Bhagwansingh1:07 to call it infallible is too strong an expression and the estimates of Sutherland and of West and Bühler seem nearer the true mark; but it is clear that both works must be accepted as bearing high authority for so long a time that they have become embedded in the general law.' The Privy Council furhter lays down 'their Lordships cannot concur with Knox J. in saying that their (of the Dattaka mīmāṁsā and Dattaka-candrika ) authority is open to examina tion, explanation, criticism, adoption or rejection like any scientific treatises on European jurisprudence.' 1408 Even in those parts of the Bombay Presidency where the Vyavahāramayūkba is a work of paramount authority, the Dattakamimaṁsā has on the subject of adoption been preferred in certain matters to the

Vyavahāramayukha. For example, the Bombay High Court, following the Dattakamimamsā, has laid down that among the three higher castes a man cannot adopt his own daughter's, sister's, or mother's sister's son. The view of the Vyavahāra mayūkha, on the contrary, is that he can take these in adop tion. The limits to which Nandapandita will be followed by the courts are laid down in Ramachandra v. Gopal : The authority of Nandapaṇdita must be accepted except where it can be shown that he deviates from or adds to the smṛtis or where his version of the law is opposed to such established custom as the Courts recognise :.1409 

Several views expressed in the Dattakamimāṁsā have been set at naught in the various provinces by the British Indian Courts. Nandapandita held that a widow could not adopt at all.1410 Except in Mithila this view has nowhere been entertained in India and the Courts have held that the Law of Benares, Bengal, Madras and Bombay is different. Nandapandita put forward the position that the brother's son must be preferred for adoption over any other sagotra or sapinda.1411 This has, however, been treated in all provinces as no more than a mere recommendation and that failure to observe it entails no legal or religious consequences whatever. The expression putra cchāyā' in ' putracchāyāvaham'occurring in the text of Saunaka was explained by Nandapandita to mean “similarity to a son born' and he said that the similarity consisted in the possibility of being begotten by means of niyoga and the like.1412 Suther land wrongly introduced the word 'marriage' after niyoga in his translation and some of the High Courts in India, following this wrong translation, evolved the rule that no one could be adopted whose mother the adopting father could not have legally married in her maiden state,1113 But the Bombay High Court bas laid down that the rule is restricted to the three

specified cases of the daughter's son, the sister's son, and the mother's sister's son.+14 From the text (brāhmaṇāditraye nāsti bhāgineyaḥ sutaḥ kvacit), Nandapandita evolved the curious rule that a widow cannot adopt to her deceased husband her own brother's son. But the Privy Council has refused to follow this dictum on the ground that the gloss of Nandapandita is an extension not based on the authority of any smṛti and has upheld such an adoption.1418 

It should be noted that the Hindu Adoption and Main tenance Act' (No. 78 of 1956 ) passed by the Indian Parliament has made far-reaching and radical changes in the Law of Hindu Adoption and section 4 of that Act overrules all texts, rules or interpretations of Hindu Law or customs and usages as part of that law, except in so far as they may have been expressly saved by that Act. 

About the personal history of Nandapandita we do not know much. Mandlik in his Hindu Law (LXXII, n. 3) gives what information he could gather from descendants of Nandapandita living in Benares. According to him the founder of the family was Lakṣmidhara who was a resident of Bidar (now in the Nizam's dominions ) and who went to Benares. Nandapandita was the sixth in descent from him. Dr. Jolly visited at Benares Pandit Dhundirāja Dharmādhikari who was 9th in descent from Nandapandita (Tagore Law Lectures, p. 15) and Mandlik's information also was gathered from persons who were 9th in descent from Nandapandita. Mandlik also gives a detailed genea logical tree. We learn from several works of Nandapandita and their colophons that he was also nanied Vinayakapandita and was the son of Ramapandita of Benares who is styled Dharma dhikari. Nandapandita also is described as Dharmadhikari in the Saniskāranirnaya-taranga of the Smṛtisindhu (vide note 1392 above). It appears that Nandapandıta was at different times patronised by rich patrons from different parts of India. He composed the Srāddhakalpalatā for Paramānanda of the Sahagila

Mandlik notes that Nandapandita is credited with the author ship of 13 works. Eight works of Nandapandita have been named and described above. Mandlik nanes six of these. Besides these he is said to have written Navarātra-pradipa which has been published in the Princess of Wales Sarasvati Bhavana Series, three sections of a work named Harivamśavilasa (viz. dūnakautuka, āhnika kautuka and saṛskārakautuka ), Balubhusi, Tirthakalpalatā, Kalanirnayakautuka, Kāsiprakasa, Madhavānanda, But we saw above (note 1393) that the Balabhūși is only a commentary on the Tattvamuktāvali (probably composed by another writer ). The Kāsiprakāśa was certainly composed by Nandapandita as he is described in the India Office ms. to have been the son of Rāmapandita.1416 That work was composed at the order of one Sarvabhatta, who was the guru of Krsnanayaka of Madhurā. In Mitra's Notices two works, Jyotiḥsastrasamuccaya and Smārta samuccaya, are described as composed by Nandapandita, son of Devaśarman and Vṛndā.1417 The latter seems to have been an extensive work and dealt with tithinirnaya, intercalary month, marriage, sapinda relationship, the samskāras, daily observances, antyești (funeral rites ), āśauca, sudd'ri, śrāddha, prāyaścitta, dayabhāga and vyavahāra. Though the name of the father, Deva śarman, creates suspicion in one's mind, both these works must be regarded as the works of Nandapandita, son of Ramapandita, as in the Smārtasamuccaya the author refers his readers to his Dattaka-mimamsā for the subject of adoption. It is not unlikely that just as Nandapandita had the alias Vinayaka, his father Rāmapandita was also called Devaśarman. 

Mandlik ( Hindu Law LXXII, n. 3) notes that on a copy of the Madhavananda-kavya composed by Nanda the year samvat 1655 ( 1599 A. D.) is given, probably in Nandapandita's own handwriting.
