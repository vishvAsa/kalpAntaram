Sec. 2 Sources of Pharma : 

.. pp. 6-11 

ATII 

According to Gautama, Apastamba, Vasiṣtha, Manu, Yājña valkya - principal sources were Veda, smrtis and custom - Vedas do not contain positive precepts on dharma, but give information incidentally-examples from Vedic literature suggesting dharmasa stra rules - division of ancient Sanskrit works into three groups, viz. the Vedic Sajjhitās, the Brahmanas and Sātras - Kalpa is one of the six angas of the Veda - Kalpa di ting'!ished by Tantravārtika from Kalpasutras.comprehensive pill thing of Kalpa - Kalpasūtras classi fied into three classes, viz. ? lutistras, Grhyasūras and Dharma sūtras - brief review of Dr. Ram Gopal's large work on 'India of Vedic Kalp:sutras - mainly uzals !1 Gșh;a and Dharmasūtras, that too, not critically or thoroughly.

C. dharmasūtras had become authoritative-method of dealing with the whole dharmasastra litera ture followed in this book, first dharmasūtras, then early metrical smstis like those of Manu ard Yājñavalkya, later versified smstis, then commentaries and digests, such as the Mitāksarā - chronology of early writers very difficult to settle - Max Müller's view that works in continuous śloka metre followed sūtra works not acceptable. 

Sec. 4 Dharmasūtras : 

.. pp. 19-22 Many of them formed part of the Kalpa and were studied in distinct sūtra-caranas - dharmasūtras of Āpastamba and Baudhā yana presuppose grhyasūtras of thier carana - no dharmasūtras ex tant corresponding to the śrauta and gshya sutras of Asvalāyana, Saṅkhāyana and Mānava-Tantravārtika on what dharmasūtra was studied in what particular Vedic Sakhā-all dharmasūtras gradually became authoritative in all schools - close connection between grhyasūtras and dharmasutras on certain topics - scope of dharma sūtras - gìhyasotras sometimes refer to dharmasūtras - points of distinction between dharmasūtras and the other smstis.

Sec. 6 Baudhayana-dharmasutra : 

.. pp. 38-53 Baudhāyana is a teacher of the Black Yajurveda-arrangement of Baudhayana kalpa according to Dr. Burnell and Dr. Caland - Baudhāyanagrhya presupposes the Baudhāyanadharmasūtra - gshya (I11.9.6) speaks of pravacan:kāra Kanva Bodhāyana and sūtrakāra A pastamba - tarpana in Baudhayana dharmasutra (II. 5. 27 ) men tions Kanva Bodhāyana, Apastamba and Hiranyakesin - contents of Baudhāyanadharmasūtra - extant sūtra has not come down in tact-fourth praśna probably an interpolation - third praśna also not free from doubt - Baudhāyana III.10 taken from Gautama. Baudhā yana III. 6 agrees closely with Viṣṇudharmasutra 48 - Dr. Jolly thinks both borrowed from a conimon source - probably Viṣṇu borrows from Baudhāyana - repetitions exist even in the first two praśnas - form and structure of Baudhāyana - quotes numerous verses, even in the first two praśnas - language of Baudhāyana often departs from Paninian standard - literature known to Baudhayana - several authors on dharma together with their views mentioned by Baudhāyana - Asura Kapila said to be originator of asramas-Sabara, Kumārila, Viśvarūpa and Medhātithi refer to Baudhāyana dharma sūtra - home of Baudhāyana - Baudhāyana is styled pravacanakāra and Apastamba sūtrakāra - Bühler holds that Baudhayana was a southern teacher - sets out five peculiar usages of southern part - buotes several views about Āryāvarta - age of Baudhāyana dharma

Sec. 7 Dharmasūtra of Ăpastamba: 

.. pp. 53-90 

The Ăpastambakalpasūtra of the Black Yajurveda divided in to 30 prasnas, dharmasūtra constituting 28th and 29th prasnas thereof - Ápastamba is one of the five subdivisions of the Khāndi keya school of Taittiriyaśākhā -Apastanibagļhya and dharma-sūtras are compositions of the same author-some sutras of the two are iden tical-Ap. gphya does not treat of some topics as they are dealt with in dharmasūtra - though Dr. Ram Gopal points out ten sutras in Ap. Gr. about the choice of a marriageable girl there is only one rule worth something - there are several passages where Ap. Dh. S. presupposes Āp. Gr.-contents of Ap.dharmasūtra-form and struc ture of Ap. dharmasūtra-Ap. is more archaic and un- Paninian th any other dharmasūtra-many unfamiliar words in Ap.-several verses quoted in Ap-literature known to Āp.- Ap. mentions six angas of Veda and ten writers on dharma by name-Svetaketu and Ap.-Hārita quoted frequently by Ap. - Ap. controverts several veiws-striking coincidences between Gautama and Ap. - Āp. quotes a verse from Purāṇa and speaks of the view of Bhaviṣyatpurāna - Apastamba and Manu - Apastamba presupposes many rules of the Mimāṁsā and agrees closely with Jaimini's sūtras-age of Ap. Dh. S. - quoted by Sabara, Kumārila, Saskarācārya, Viśvarūpa and Medhātithj - home and personal history of Apastamba not known - Dr. Ram Gopal's view about Ápastamba being earlier than Pāụini who gives Apastamba's name in Bidādiga na, refuted - reply to Dr. Ram Gopal's puerile arg'iments about the home of Apastamba etc.-Áp. is later than Gautama and probably Baudhayana - Ap. Dh. S. may be assigned to the period of 450-350 B. C, not 600-300 B. C. ( as in the first edition)- Áp. condemns niyoga, rejects secondary sons, does not admit paiśāca and Prājupatya forms of marriage - divergence 

Synopsis of Contents 

between the views of Ap. and Gautama and other sūtrakāras - Haradatta's is the only commentary extant on Ap.- Apastamba smrti in verse. 

Sec. 8 Hiranyakesidharmasutra : 

.. 91-94 

Hiranyakesidharmasūtra forms 26th and 27th praśnas of the Hiranyakeśikalpa - Hiraṇyakesin's can be hardly called an indepen dent work, as it borrows hundreds of sūtras word for word from 

Ap.- a few additions made to Ap. in Hiranyakesi Dh.S. - Hiranya kesin's readings are smoother and more classical than Āpastamba's - arrangement of sūtras also is somewhat different in the two -com. of Mahadeva called Ujjvalā on Hyraṇyakeśin is almost the same as Haradatta's on Āp. - Bühler thinks Mahadeva borrows from Haradatta - Mahadeva's com. in a few places contains more matter than Haradatta's and Mahadeva differs from Haradatta. 

FU 

Sec. 9 Vasistha-dharmasutra : 

.. pp. 94-112 Different editions of Vasistha contain different numbers of chapters - Kumārila says it was specially studied by Rgvedins - ex planation of this statement - nothing special in the Vasisthadharma sūtra to connect it with Rgveda - contents of the Vasiṣthadharma sūtra - style of Vas. Dh. S. resembles Gautama's - many sūtras of Vas, identical with Gautama and Baudhāyana - form of Vasistha dharmasūtra resembles Baudhāyaradharmasūtra - Medhātithi and Mitakṣarā quote from almost all chapters of extant Vasistha and so does Viśvarūpa - literature known to Vasiṣtha-Vasiṣtha prohibits learning language of Mlecchas - authors on dharmaśātsra named by Vasiṣtha - Vasistha's references to the views of Manu are made with reference to a work of Manu almost identical with the present Manu smṛti and do not compel us to forniluate the existence of a Māna vadharmasutra - Bühler wrong in taking Vas. Dh. S. 4.8 as a quo tation from Mānavadharmasūtra-only Vas. Dh. S. 12.16 and 19.37 where Manu is quoted have no corresponding verses in the present Manusmrti - over forty verses are entirely common to Vas. and present Manusmīti - conclusion that Vas. contains borrowings from the present Manusmṛti or its prototype in verse - Vas. Dh. S. 22 is the same as Gautama 19 - Dr. Jolly's view that Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 and 18-22 are borrowed from Viṣṇudharmasūtra chap. 56 and 87 or its original the Kathakadharmasutra is wrong - home of Vas, to 



the north of Narmadā, according to Bühler - this is mere specula tion - earliest reference to Vasiṣtha as a writer on dharma is in Manu (8.140 ) - age of Vasiṣtha - Vasiṣtha's views are ancient, praticularly about secondary sons, about Dattaka son, about niyoga and remarriage - he mentions only six forms of marriage - but in other matters differs from Gaut. or Baudh. viz, on adoption, on documents - Vas. Dh. S. between 303–100 B. C.- whether Vas. 18.4 ( Rāmaka v. 1. Romaka ) contains a reference to the Romans - the author of the extant Vas. Dh. S. appears to be eclectic and the extant Vas. Dh. S. is only a re-hash of the Ap. Dh. S., Baud. Dh. S. and Manu - passages from the Samhitas and Brahmanas quoted in or referred to by Vas. Dlı. S. outnumber the Rgvedic passages - this shows that Vas. Dh. S. did not at first attach itself to the Rgveda - Dr. Ram Gopal's remarks on the passages of Vas, and the three Gṭ. sūtras attached to Rgveda are misleading - Viddha-Vasi ștha, an early compilation - there is a Bṛhad Vasiṣtha and a Jyotir Vasistha - Yajñasvāmin commented upon Vas. Dh. S. 

Sec. 10 Viṣṇudharmasutra : 

... 112-127 

Viṣṇu Dh. S. contains 100 chapters and yet sutra not extensive - several chap. (40, 42, 76 ) contain only one sutra and one verse - first chap. and the last two are entirely in verse, the rest in mixed prose and verse - Viṣṇu Dh. S. closely connectej with Kathasākha - Dr. Jolly says chap. 21, 67, 73 and 86 of Vișnu closely correspond with Kathaka gshya - but Viṣṇu Dh. S. is not the work of the author of Kathaka grhya - contents of Viṣṇu Dh. S. - Viṣṇu resembles Vas. Dh. S. - its peculiar feature that it professes to be re vealed by God Viṣṇu - its style, easy and diffuse - work contains old and new material - hundreds of sūtras are prose renderings of hund reds of verses occurring in our Manu - hypothesis of a common origin or borrowing by both from a floating mass of verses unten able - extant Viṣṇudharmasutra borrows from Manu-Vispu contains verses identical with the Bhagavadgitā and Yājñavalkya smrti - Dr. Jolly's view that Yājñavalkya borrows his anatomical section from Viṣṇu not correct - Vispu Dh. S. contains long list of tirthas, the word Jaiva for Jupiter - those wanting in Yājñavalkya - extant Viṣṇu Dh. S. later than Manusmṛti and Yajñavalkyasmsti - Viśva rūpa does not quote a single sutra of Viṣṇu by name, though he refers to Viṣṇu (ch. 97) for orders of samnyasins - Mitāksarā 

Synopsis of Contents 

quotes hardly any verse from Viṣṇu - Aparārka and Smsticandrika quote Viṣṇu profusely - verses were added at a late date to original sūtra - literature known to Viṣṇu Dh.S. -Viṣṇu mentions the seven days of the week, recommends the practice of saii, speaks of pus takas, of many good and evil omens among which the sight of yellow-robed Buddhist ascetics is included - it prohibits speech with Mlecchas and journeys to Mlcccha countries, it dilates on worship of Vasudeva - though Viṣṇu agrees in some respects with Kathaka grhya, on some points it differs from it- date of older kernel of Viṣṇu may be 300 to 10j B.C. - additions made after 3rd century A. D. and before 7th century - some sūtras agree closely with Nārada - Bșhad Viṣṇu and Vrddha Viṣṇu and Laghu Viṣṇu - Nanda pandita's com. on the Viṣṇu Dh. S. - probably Bhāruci also com mented on it. 

Sec. 11 The Dharmasūtra of Harita : 

... pp. 127-136 

Baudhāyana, Apastamba and Vasistha quote Hārīta as an authority - Mr. Islampurkar secured a ms. of Harītadharmasūtra at Nasik in 30 chapters - contents of that ms. - its relation to Maitra yaniyasashitā - it mentions the Kaśmirian word “Kaphella" - two-fold classification of śruti and its explanation - quotations in commentaries and digests show that Harita dealt exhaustively with the same topics that are found in other dharmasūtras - Kumārila mentions Hārita as dharmaśāstrakāra but does not assign him to any particular caraña as he does Āpastamba and others - notable doctrines of Harita - mentions worship of Ganesa - Harita's verses on vyavahāra quoted in nibandhas are later than the sūtra - quoted by Aprārka, Kalpataru, Brahmacarikanda, Sm. C. - Laghu Hārita and Viddha Hārita - latter in verse is later than Yajñavalkya, Nārada and Katyayana. 

Sec. 12 The Dharmasūtra of Sunkha-Likhita : 

... pp. 136-142 

From Tantravārtika it appears that dharmasūtra of Saṅkha Likhita was studied by Vājasaneyins - Mahabharata (Śānti 23 contains story of brothers Saṅkha and Likhita - Pali story in Dighanikāya seems to be based on the story in the Mahabharata - various compilations ascribed to Saṅkha alone or Likhita alone or to both - restoration of Dharmasūtra in the Annals of Bhandarkar

History of Dharmaśāsira 

Institute (vols. VII, VIH ) - Verse Sarkhasmsti stricter than prose Saṅkha-Likhita - com. on dharmasūtra mentioned in Kalpataru and Vivādaratnākara - doctrines of dharmasūtra similar to those of other dharmasūtras - speaks of twelve secondary sons - allows niyoga - speaks of several ordcals - defines Aryavarta as between Sindhu-Sauvira and Kampilya - literature known to Saṅkha - Likhita - probable age between 300 B.C. - 100 A. D. 

Sec. 13 Mānavadharmasūtra : Did it exist ? 

... pp. 143-149 

Max Müller and Weber responsible for the theory that the extant Manusmṛti was a recast of an ancient Mānavadharmasūtra now lost - hardly any data for the sweeping generalisation of Max Müller that all genuine dharmaśāstras are nothing but more modern texts of earlier sūtra works on kuladharma - one main plank of this theory that the continuous en ployment of the sloka metre was un known in the sutra period is now exploded - Bühler supports Max Müller's theory by some additional arguments - Vasiṣtha IV. 5-8 on which Bühler relies not properly understood by him - Vasistha ( 19-37) quotes a Mānava sloka which is not in the Anuṣtubh metre and not found in extant Manu and Bühler thinks it is taken from Mānavadharmasūtra · Bühler's reliance on a fragment of Uśanas which is corrupt is not worth consideration - Bühler relies on Kamandakiyanitisāra ( II. 3 and XI. 67) where Mānavas are said to hold that there are three vidyās for a king and that Manu said that king's council should consist of 12 ministers - These views not the same in extant Manu - Bühler's conclusion not correct - Kamandaka is only paraphrasing Kautiliya-Bühler's generalisation about Mānava or Manavāh without foundation - Kumarila, Śhaṅkara and Viśvarūpa all employ · Mānava 'for Manusmṛti - Bühler relies on analogy of the complete set of Apastamba and Raudhayana sūtras for holding that a Mānavadharmasūtra existed - Proper explanation of Vas. Dh. S. IV. 5-8 - Bühler not right in saying that Vas. Dh. S. 11. 23, 12, 16, 23.43 either contradict Manu or find no counterpart therein - analogy of Apastamba sūtras of no use. excepting the three caranas of the Black Yajurveda, no carana of any Veda has a dharmasūtra attributed to the founder of that carapa - an explanation suggested - existing materials not sufficient to establish theory that a Mūnavadharmasūtra once existed.

Sec. 28 Śātātupa: 

. . pp. 294–296 A sūtra work of Śātātapa on dharma dealing with prayaścitta, śrāddha and ācāra must have existed - verses of Śātātapa quoted in Mitakṣarī and other later works - this is probably different from smṛti work - several verse compilations ascribed to śātātapa - Viddha Satatapa and Bṛhat Sātātapa.

rata, Manu, &c.) and ( a narrower sense ) dharmaśāstra - smsti, a source of dharma according to Gautama and others - references to smrtis in early inscriptions - spistis mirrored the beliefs and practi ces of people and also influenced writers and ordinary people; number of smstis went on increasing - Yājñavalkya enumerates twenty writers of smrtis, Parāśara 19 - Tantravārtika speaks of 18 dharmasamhitas - Caturvimsatimata gives views of 24 writers - a smṛti called Sat-trirśanmata - Paithinasi enumerates 36 and so does Aparārka - Vrddha Gautama enumerates 57 - Viramitrodaya enumerates 18 smstis, 18 upasmṛtis and 21 more - total number of smṛtis about 100 - these are products of widely separated ages - some entirely in prose, some entirely in verse, some are mixed - chronology of smstis presents perplexing problems - two or three smrtis go under the same name, e. g. Harita, Atri, Sātātapa - sectarian zealots fabricate certain smrtis - the prefixes laghu, brhat and viddha applied to smstis - well-known verses are ascribed to different authors, as authors quote from memory.

are mentioned in Mapu VI. 54, VIII. 124, IX .158 - Manu Praja pati is mentioned in X. 78, XII. 123 - in l. 35 among ten Praja patis primeval Manu is mentioned - criticism of some one-sided and biased remarks of Hopkins about Manu - involved account in Manusmrti about the creation of the world by Paraniātman - the fact that the Manusmṛti mentions human authors like Atri, Bhrgu etc. and refers to dasyus who speak mleccha and Arya languae ges etc. indicates that the extant Manusmrti is not older than 200 B. C.- age of Manusmrit - external evidence - Medhātithi's is the first extant commentary - Viśvarūpa quotcs 200 verses - Śhaṅkara. Kumārila and Sabara refer to Manu - Bșhaspati had the present text of Manu before him - Asvaghosa in his Vajrasuci quotes several verses from Mānavadharma' some of which are found in our Manu - Rāmāyana ( Kiṣkidhā 18. 30-32 ) contains Manu VIII. 318 and 316 - Maou attained present form long before 2nd century A. D.-there are earlier and later strata in Manu -contra dictory statements as to Brahmana marrying a sūdra woman, about appropriate forms of marriage, about niyoga, about flesh eating - Bühler's conclusion is that cosmological and philosophi cal portions in 1st and 12th books, rules about mixed castes and duties of castes in 10th book are later additions - all additions made before 3rd century A. D.-Manusmṛti has not suffered several recasts - quotations cited as Viddha Manu and Bṛhan-Manu are later than Manusmrti - extant Manu older than Yājñavalkya - Manu mentions Yavanas, Kambojas, Sakas, Pahlavas and Cinas - extant Manusmṛti composed between 2nd century B. C. and 2nd century A. D. - relation of Mahābhārata and Manu - conflict of views between Mandlik, Hopkins and Bühler - Hopkins holds that there was a mass of floating verses ascribed to mythical Manu on which both Manusmrti and Mahabharata drew – Bühler says that the floating mass of verses was not all attributed to Manu - Manu mentions stories and names that occur in the Mahābhārata but these names go into Vedic antiquities - Manu never names the Mahābhārata, while the latter often refers to'rājadharmas or śāstra of Manu' or to what Manu said ' - Jayaswal's remarks on Manu XII. 100 are worthless for settling the date of the Manu smrti – both Hopkins and Bühler hold that the Anuśāsanaparva and Sāntiparva knew a Manusmrti, but earlier books, when ever they speak of Manu, refer to floating mass of popular verses - this conclusion not correct - final conclusion, viz., long before 4th

century B. C. there was a dharmaśāstra inverse attributed to Svā yambhuva Manu, there was another work on rājadharna attribu ted to Prācetasa Manu, that probably there was one work, then between 200 B. C, and 200 A. D. Manusmīti was recast - extant Mababhārata later than extant Manusmṛti-Vṛddha-Manu, if a sepa rate work, must have been composed before the 7th century A.D. influence of Manu spread to Cambodia and other countries beyond India - Manu had several commentators, Medbātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyana, Rāghavānanda, Nandana and Rāmacandra - Asahāya commented on Manu - Udayakara is another commenta tor and so is Dharanidhara - Nārāyaṇa flourished between 1100 1300 A.D.-Rāghavānanda later than 1400 A.D.-Vṛddha Manu and Bṛhan-Manu - explanation as to how these originated. 

Sec. 32 The Two Epics 

... pp. 349-408 

The two great Epics contain numerous passages bearing on topics of Dharmasastra - Mbh. itself claims as being composed by Vyāsa as a great Dharmaśāstra, as Arthasāstra etc. - Mbh. consists of one hundred thousand verses – a great deal has been written about the Two Epics - a work for popular education long before the 7th cent. A. D. - Ånuvamsa Slokas in Mbh. - From the references in Papipi and Patañjali it is certain that the story of Mbh. is diffe rent from the story of Rāmāyaṇa - there was considerable scope for adding stories and didactic matter and hence the Mbh. became very much inflated by additions at different times - literature known to Mbh. - criticism against four passages relied upon by Hopkins as referring to Rāmāyaṇa – the core of the Mbh. existed before 500 B. C.-references to Mbh. in some early inscriptions - Nilakantha's commentary on Mbh. -- date of the Mahābhārata war – both the Epics inspired many later writers to compose Sanskrit dramas on the characters and stories contained in them - the Mahābhārata, predominantly a Vaiṣžavite work. 

Several recensions of the Rāmāyaṇa -- the three well-known being Southern, Bengali and North-Western - relation to the Dasarathajātaka – references to the legends in the Mabābhārata occur in the extant Rāmāyaṇa - Rāmāyaṇa mainly being a Kāvya is less quoted than the Mahābhārata, but is relied upon as a source of dharma - the Rāmāyana exists in Bali in the Kavi language 

• Kaccit-praśna' chapters in the two epics - the Rāmāyaṇa is not

D. - total number of verses on vyavahāra in the Agnipurāna is 315, out of which the first 31 are not taken from Yājñavalkya - almost all of these 31 taken from Nārada - Garuḍapurāṇa (chap. 93) expressly says that the dharma

promulgated by Yajñavalkya was imparted therein - Garuḍa (chap. 93-106 ) contains dharmaśāstra material taken from acāra and prāyaścitta sections of Yājñavalkya - Garuḍa ( 93-102 ) deals with acara and ( 102-106 ) with prāyaścitta - Garuḍapurāna omits rāja dharma section of Yājñavalkya -- only a few verses of Yāj. are repeated word for word, while a summary only is given of several verses - comparison of the text of the Garuḍapurāṇa with Viśvard pa's text and that of the Mitākṣari - Garuḍapurāṇa represents text intermediate between Viśvarūpa and Mitāksarā - are there different strata in Yājñavalkya ? text mainly the same from 700 A. D. and little evidence to show that the text of Yājsavalkya as we have it contains several strata - comparison of Yajñavalkyasmrti with Manusmṛti – close agreement in phraseology between the two - Yājñavalkya usually tries to compress Manu's dicta - Yaj. adds Vinayakaśānti and Grahaśānti and ordeals, while Manu omits first two and cursorily refers to two ordeals - Yāj. silent on origin of world which we have in Manu - style of Yajñavalkya - contents of smsti - literature known to Yajñavalkyasmrti - enumerates 19 authors on dharma - Yoga-Yajñavalkya - contents of its twelve chapters some recommendations of Yoga-Yajñavalkya – it is a small work on Yoga and has little to do with Dharmaśāstra - close agreement between Viṣṇu Dh. S. and Yajñavalkya and between Kautilya and Yāj. - Manu and Yāj. differ on several points and Yāj. represents a more advanced state of thought than Manu - Manu allows brāh maṇa to marry śūdra girl, Yāj. does not - Manu condemns niyoga, Yaj. does not-same case with gambling - Yāj. takes Vināyakaśānti from Mānavagļhva - Yājñavalkyasmṛti in intimate relation to white Yajurveda and literature appurtenant to it - Yājñavalkya closely agrees with Paraskaragrhya - Dr. Jolly's theory that Yajñavalkya's work goes back to a dharmasūtra of White Yajurveda is without foundation - date of Yājsavalkyasmrti – Viśvarūpa separated from the smsti by several centuries – probable date of Yājñavalkya bet ween 100 B. C. and 300 A. D. - Lankāvatārasūtra (gāthās 814–816) refers to Yajñavalkyasmṛti - Dr. Jolly thinks that Yāj. shows acqu aintance with Greek astrology - Dr. Jacobi's theory that naming of week-days after planets first introduced by Greeks and borrowed by Indians - these theories untenable - Yāj. does not mention week days, but only the nine planets (in I. 296) - Yāj. does not mention the zodiacal signs - he arranges the naksatras from Kșttika to Bharani (I. 268 ) as the Taittiriyabrāhmaṇa does - susthe indau'

in Yāj. explained by Viśvarūpa without reference to zodiacal signs from Vedic times naksatras divided into auspicious and inauspi cious - Yājñavalkya's reference to nānakas - Yāj. regards sight of yellow-robed people as an evil omen - Dr. Jolly's date of 400 A. D. for Yajñavalkya is far too late - there is a Vrddha-Yāj., a Yoga-Yāi. and a Brhad-Yaį.-Vṛddha-Yāj. is quoted by Madhava and Aparārka - Brhad-Yaj. is quoted by Jitendra and Mit. and as such must be earlier then 1000 A.

Sec. 35 Parāśarasmṛti : 

.. pp. 459-466 Yāj, mentions Parāśara, but the extant Parasarasmṛti is pro bably a recast of an older smṛti - Garuḍapurāṇa (chap. 107) gives a summary of 39 verses of Parāśarasmṛti - from Kautilya it appears there was a work of Parāśara on politics in which vyavahāra was also dealt with - extant Parāsara in 12 chapters and 592 verses deals with acara and prayascitta alone - Parāśara, an ancient name - Parāsara mentions 19 smṛti writers - contents of the smrti - Parāśara has peculiar views – authors cited by Parasara – views of Manu frequently cited -- several identical verses in Manu and Parāsara - age of Parāśarasmṛti between 100-500 A.
