81. Pradipa 

The Smṛtyarthasāra of Sridhara enumerates the Pradipa among its authorities after the Kamadhenu.1035 The Smstican drikā in a highly paronomastic verse appears to refer to a work called Pradipa.1036 The Sarasvativilāsa 037 quotes the view of the Pradipa that even the suretyship debt of a person must be paid by his grandson. The Jivatpitska nirnaya1038 of Ramakrsna (about 1600 A. D.) quotes the Pradipa on the question that when brothers are separated they should perform separately the annual sraddha of their father and other ancestors. Nandapandita in bis commentary on the1038 Şadasiti cites the view of the Pradipa that the sutra of Paithinasi ( a woman delivered of a son bathing after twenty nights from 

delivery is entitled to perform all religious rites, while one who is delivered of a female child is so entitled after a month ) applies to the wife of one who is not a dikșita (one who has consecrated the Vedic fires ). It has been shown above (note 881 ) how the Pradipa criticizes Bhavadeva, according to the Viramitrodaya, which, in several places, cites the views of the Pradipa ( vide pp. 78, 89, 215 etc.). 

The foregoing discussion shows that the Pradipa was probably an independent work on vyavahāra, śrāddha, suddhi and other topics. Being mentioned by the Smrtyarthasāra and Smsticandri kā, it cannot be later than about 1150 A. D. As it criticizes Bhavadeva it cannot be earlier than 1100 A. D. 

1035 Vide note 839 above. 1036 पदे पदे प्रस्खलतां प्रदीपादिस्थितावपि । द्रष्टणां दृष्टिविषये चन्द्रिका प्रवितन्यते ॥ 

प्रदीप ( lamp and a word )and चन्द्रिका ( moonlight and the स्मृति 

afl) are paronomastic. 1037 africafa HTŽOTTLU Göhfufc 14: ! \#. f. p. 253; vide

The Smrtyarthasāra of Sridhara 

725 

Hemādri1010 refers to the explanation of the word kala occurring in a text of Gārgya offered by a Smṛtipradipa. It is not unlikely that he means the same work as is referred to by others as Pradipa.
