90. Śrīdatta Upadhyāya 

Mithilā has made extremely valuable and substantial contri butions to Dharmaśāstra Literature. From the days of the Yajñavalkya smrti down to modern times the land of Mithilā has produced writers whose names are illustrious. Sridatta Upadhyāya

is one of the earliest among the mediaeval Maithila nibandhakaras. He is the author of several works which will be briefly noticed, 

The Acārādarśa of Sridatta was printed in Benares at the Divakara Press and by the Venkateśvara Press in Bombay in saṁvat 1961. It is a manual of the daily religious duties of the followers of the white Yajurveda ( Vājasaneyins ),1135 such as ācamana, brushing the teeth, morning bath, saindhyā, japa, brahma yajña, tarpana, daily worship of gods, vaiśvadeva, feeding guests etc. Among the works and writers named are the following 138.-- Ācāra-cintāmani, Kalpataru, Kamadhenu, Kālikāpurana, Ganesa mjśra, Rājā (probably Bhojadeva ), Smstimahārṇava, Harihara and Halāyudha-nibandha. There is a commentary on this work called Ācārādarsabodhini composed by Gauripati or Gaurjśa, son of Dāmodara Maithila, at Benares in 1640 A. D. (Dr. Bhandar kar's report, 1883-84, p. 347). In this work he uses several vernacular words; e. g. he says that 'Sāla' tree is known as Sagavanal137 ( in the vernacular ). 

Sridatta's work called 'Chandogāhnika' was printed by the Niruayasāgara Press (Bombay, 1930 ). It summarizes at the end the principal topics viz, rinsing the mouth, bath, morning sandhyā, five daily yajñas, bhojana (midday meal), resting thereafter, evening sandhya, evening meal, repeating the Veda, going to bed. In the Introductory verse he states: looking into the smstis, Puranas, Grhyasūtras and the nibandhas of Bhūpāla (i.e. king Bhoja) and Gopāla ( the author of the Kāmadhenu ) I shall set out the alinika ( daily rites prescribed ) for Sāmavedins. At the end also he states that he studied all the pibandhas of Bhupūla and others. It is a small work (63 printed pages), but it quotes, besides the well-known sūtras, smstis and the Mahābhārata the following works : Karma pradipa (frequently pp. 19, 47, 50, 53, 60), Kamadhenu (pp. 5, 7, 8, 12, 46 &c.), Kalpataru (pp. 4, 5, 36, 58,63 &c.), Chandoga

paddhati (p. 53 ), several Purūṇas (such as Narasimha, Devi, Nandi, Padma, Brahma, Bhavisya. Mārkandeya, Matsya, Linga, Vāmana, Varāha, Vāyu, Viṣṇu, Skanda), Mahārṇavaprakasa (pp. 4, 15), Mitākṣarā (p. 31), Ratnakarandıkā (p. 11), Yogi yājñavalkya (many verses quoted on pp. 9, 10, 13, 17, 19, 27, 41, 44), Haribhakti (p. 36 ), Haribhaktidipika (p. 37), Smstimañjūsā (p. 2 said to be Daksinadesiya). He referes to his own work 

Sraddhakalpa' (p. 53). For a small work like the Chando gāhnika the author quotes a very large number of authorities. It may be noted that this work specifies (on pp. 45-46) at some length the Aparādhas that Bhagavatas should not be guilty of and explains the word Bhagavata in several ways. 

The Pit;bhakti is a manual on the Sraddha rites for students of the Yajurveda. It was based 138 on the Katiyakalpa with Karka's bhāsya thereon and on the works of Gopāla and Bhupala (i. e. Bhojadeva ). It is frequently quoted in the Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara. Among the writers named are (besides those that occur in the Acārādarsa also ): Pitphitākaraṇikāra, Nārāyaṇa vṛtti (on Asvalāyana Gr. S.), Mitākṣarā, Ratnakarandikā, Vidhi puspamālā (26 a), śubhākara, Smstimañjari, Smstimañjūsā, Halāyudha's Sraddhādhyāya. This work first treats of the details of the Pārvanaśrāddha, then of ekoddista, of the monthly srāddhas, the srāddha on the 11th day after death, of Sapindi karana, of abhyudayika śrāddha. It then proceeds to consider the definition of śrāddha. 

The Sraddhakalpa was composed by him for the Sama vedins. It is referred to in his Samayapradipal139 and Pitbhakti (folio 33b ).

The Samayapradipa treats of the proper times for various vratas. 1149 It is divided into three chapters (paricchedas ). The first is called Samayapariccheda and dilates upon the definition of vrata, on the procedure about fasts, nakta and the vratas of Ganesa and other deities, the second is called Samvatsara krtya-pariccheda and treats of vratās from the pratipadā to the amāvāsya in the several months and the third is called prakirnaka (miscellaneous ) dealing with the vratas on sankranti (the Sun's passage into another Zodiacal sign) etc. In this work Sridatta often refers to the views of the Gaudas and contrasts them with his own. He also refers to Gaudanibandha. No other writers or works except those that are already enumerated under Acārādarśa and Pit;bhakti are named in this work. On folio 7a there is a name which is somewhat indistinct and appears to be “Mitāmitrādibhiḥ'. The Samayapradipa is mentioned in the Kștya-ratnākara (pp. 400, 479, 505 ) of Candeśvara and in Śūlapāṇi's Durgotsava-vivekall4i Sridatta is more frequently quoted in the Sraddhakriya-kaumudi of Govindānanda than almost any other author or work. 

As Sridatta names the Kalpataru, Harihara and Halayudha's work on sraddha he must have flourished later than 1200 A. D. As Candeśvara mentions his Samayapradipa, Sridatta must have flourished before the first quarter of the 14th century. If Ganesamiśra mentioned in the Acāradarśa be the same as Ganesvaramiśra, the author of Sugatisopana and uncle of Cande śvara ( which appears extremely probable), then Sridatta flouri shed a short time before Candeśvara and must have composed his works between 1275 and 1510 A. D. 

Śridatta affords hardly any information about himself or his family. But as he refers to certain writers by the general word Gaudāḥ' (pakvatailam na duṣyatiti Gaudāḥ p. 12 of Chandogāhnika) it may be assumed that he was not a Gauda but a Maithila.

He was liberal enough to assert that a sūdra 142 can perform Vaiśvadeva and the offering of bali, but he cannot adopt the procedure of Sakala as it includes Vedamantras; he can, however, perform those rites with 'namaḥ' as the Mantra and relies on Yāj. I. 12 and Vispupurāna in support. The Samayapradipa of Sridatta is quoted by Raghunandana in (vol. I), Mala p. 839 and (vol. II) in Ekādaśī p. 44. 

It appears that there was another Maithila writer called Śridattamisra, son of Nāgeśvaraniśra, who composed the Ekāgnidānapaddhati and one or two other works (Hp. Nepal cat. p. 129). The Nepal Ms. of the Ekāgnidāna-paddhati was copied in La-Sam 299 (Lakṣmanasena era 299, i. e. 1418 A.D.). Vide Hp. Nepal cat. XII, 45 and 129. So this Sridatta flourished towards the end of the 14th century in the reign of Devasimha son of Bhavesa. Vide JASB for 1915 pp. 379-381 and 388-390 for Sridatta.
