88. Hemādri 

Hemādri and Madhava are the Castor and Pollux in the galaxy of daksinātya writers on Dharmaśāstra. Hemādri is a very voluminous writer. He is the author of the Caturvarga cintamani, an encyclopedia of ancient religious rites and observances. From ancient times in India the goals of human life (puruṣārthas ) were said to be four viz. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokșa ( and were spoken of as Caturvarga'). Moksa could be attained only by a few men but as to the other three ( spoken of as Trivarga ) all could secure them, according to their abilities and activities (vide Manu II. 224). This subject of Purusārthas has been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 2-11, Vol. III. pp. 8-10 and 241-43 and Vol. V. pp. 1626-1632. According to the statements contained in the work itself the author intended to treat Dharmasastra in five sections, called vrata, dāna, tirtha, moksa and pariśesa. 1103 The Parisesa khanda was divided into four parts, viz., Devatā, Kālanirṇaya, Karmavipaka, Laksaṇasamuccaya.104 The Caturvarga-cintamani has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica Series. Four volumes containing 6 parts and covering about 6009 pages have been so far printed. The second and third volumes have two parts each. The fourth volume which deals with prāvascitta does not appear to be the work of Hemadri.l105 The work so far published is concerned with vrata, dāna, śrāddha and kāla (latter two being parts of the Pariseṣa-khanda ). That portion of the Caturvarga cintāmaṇi which was intended to treat of tirtha and mokșa has not yet come to light. It is extremely doubtful whether the author

was able to carry out his gigantic scheme Mss. of portions of the great work are described in the catalogues under vairous names, e.g. I. O. Cat. No. 1379, p. 407 on santikapaustikāni is the same subject that is treated in vratakhanda pp. 1003ff., though there are considerable variations between the Ms. and the printed text. 

Hemādri's is a standard work on the subjects with which he deals. He quotes most profusely from smṛtis and purāṇas and Dames a host of writers. He appears to have been a profound student of the Parvamimarisa. The discussions in his work, parti cularly on śrāddha and kāla, cannot be well understood without thorough acquaintance with the numerous nyāyas of the mimāssā which he employs at every step. To illustrate this a few instances may be cited at random. On pp. 137, 143, 156, 159 of his Kala. nirṇaya (vol. III part 2 ) he makes use of four different nyāyas of. the mimamsā. 1100 The eminent commentators and nibandhakāras on dharmaśāstra and other works named by him are given below.1107 It is somewhat remarkable that though he quotes Aparārka and the Smsti-candrikā scores of times he hardly ever mentions by name the Mitākṣarā of Vijñāneśvara. Though he does not promise a treatment of vyavabāra, here and there he makes sallies into the domain of vyavahāra. For example, he quotes the well-known sutra of Gautama ( 10. 39 ) on the sources

of ownership and holds a lengthy discussion thereon.1108 In ano ther place he digresses into the question of the various kinds of stridhana and their devolution (vol. III, part 1, pp. 530-531 ). He was of opinion that everyone, to whatever śākhā he may belong, should perform śrāddha in accordance with the directions thereon in all śākhās, kalpa and gļhya sūtras, smstis, purāṇas and usages.1108 He makes the important statement1110 that a person following any particular Vedic śākhā may enter into alliance by marriage with any other person of the same country following another Vedic śākha. 

Hemādri gives some account of himself in his work. The Mss. present great variations from the printed text. He belonged to the Vatsagotra. 1111 He was the grandson of Vasudeva and the son of Kamadeva. The introductions to the khandas contain fulsome praise of Hemādri. One verse says that Hemādri scored out by showering wealth on poor people the lines that Brahmā had drawn on their forehead at the time of their birth ( foredooming them to eternal poverty) and that Brahmā acquiesces in such conduct of Hemādri."112 Another verse says that none existed, exists or will exist surpassing Hemādri.1113 He describes himself as in charge of the imperial

records of Mahadeva, the Yadava king of Devagiri (modern Daulatabad ).1114 In the colophons and the body of the work also he is described as the karanādhisvara of Mahadeva, as highly honoured by the king and as a minister (mantrin) of the king. 1115 He gives in the introduction to the Vratakhanda a detailed pedigree of the Yādavas of Devagiri. In the section on kāla (vol. III, part 2) he starts with Sanghana (i. e. Singhana of the inscriptions ), then speaks of his son Jaitrapala (i. e. Jaitugi ), his son Krsna (or Kanhara) and lastly of Maha deva, son of the younger brother of Krsna. This is not the place to go into the genealogy of the Yadavas. There are some discrepancies between the genealogy as presented by Hemādri and as gathered from the inscriptions and numerous copperplate grants of the Yādavas. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. I, part 2, pp. 248–249 for Hemādri and pp. 268-275 for extracts from the Vratakhanda, pp. 252 and 519 for two pedigrees of the Devagiri Yadavas and pp. 511-534 for history. The following may be consulted for the principal grants of the Yadavas :- Ind. Ant. vol. 17, p. 117 ( Kalasbudruk plate of Bhillama dated sake 948 or 1025 A. D.), E. I. vol. III p. 110 (Bahal inscription of Singhaṇa dated sake 1144), E. I. vol. III pp. 217–18 (Gadag inscription of Bhillama dated sake 1113 i. e. 1191 A. D.), Ind. Ant. vol. 14, p. 68 (grant of Kysṇa or Kanhara dated 1249-50 A. D.), Ind. Ant. vol. 14, p. 314 ( Paithan plate of Rāmacandra dated sake 1193), E. I. vol. XIII, p. 198 ( Thana plate of Ramacandra dated śake 1194 i. e. 1272 A. D.), E. I. vol. XIX, p. 20 ( Mamdapur inscription of Kanhara dated sake 1172 i. e. 1250 A. D. wherein his younger brother Mahadeva is described as yuvarāja). Mahadeva reigned from 1260 to 1271 and Rāmacandra, the son of Kssna, from 1271 to 1309 A. D. Since in the Caturvarga-cintamani Hemādri is said to be the keeper of the state-records of Mahadeva, that work must have been

composed at some time between 1260 and 1270 A. D. There are contemporary records available showing that Hemadri was in high favour not only with Mahadeva but also with his successor Rāmacandra. The Thana plate of Rāmacandra (dated sake 1194, i. e. 1272 A. D. ) records the grant of a village called Vaul in Sasati ( modern Sāsti in the Thana District) to thirty-two brāhmaṇas by Acyuta Nāvaka of the Gautama gotra and descendant of Jalhana, who was the governor of Konkan, and describes!116 Hemādri as one who had attained a preeminent position in the government through the favour of Rāmacandra and as one who was in charge of all ( state ) records and was the foremost minister. 

Hemadri is frequently cited by Raghunandana in his Smsti tattva and rarely criticized ; vide (vol. 1). Tithi pp. 1, 11, 16, 18, 120; Sraddha pp. 285, 286; Jyotistattva 678, Mala® 755, 836; Samskara 891; (vol. II) Ekādaśī 37, 44, 90 (cr.), Udvāha 145, Suddhi 273, 339 (mentions Parisesakhanda ) 356. 

Vide a paper in J. O. R. ( Madras) vol. XII pp. 46-60 by Dr. P. Srinivasachar on the Yadavas of Devagiri, that shows that the last dated Inscription of Kssra is dated 12th April 1259, that Mahadeva succeeded him and that some time elapsed between the death of Mahadeva and the accession of Ramacandra, and that Hemadri was in great favour with both Mahadeva and Rāmacandra. The pedigree ( relevant to this writer ) is Bhillama Jaitugi--Singhana (and also Simha, Simhaṇa, Simhala )-Jaitugi II Krsna (also written in Inscriptions as Kanhāra, Kanharadeva, Kandharadeva, dates ranging from sake 1169 to 1175) and Mahadeva who succeeded Kļṣṇa; (Kļṣna's son Rāmacandra or Ramarāya, one date is śake 1199 )—Saṅkaradeva succeeded in sake 1232 ( 1310-11 A. D.) and was killed by Malik Kafar two years later. Vide JBBRAS vol. XII pp. 1-50 ( by Dr. Fibet). It is probable that Mahadeva, brother of Kṭsna, succeeded because Krṣna's son Rāmacandra was very young. 

Hemādri is credited with a commentary on Saunaka's Prana vakalpa.1117 He appears to have written a srādha-kalpa according

to the rules of Katyāyana which is distinct from his Śraddha khauda (vide Calcutta Sanskrit College mss. cat., vol. II, p. 163, No. 217 and Stein's cat. p. 105). Hemadri also wrote a commentaryllis called Kaivalyadipikā on the Muktāphala of Vopadeva, the famous author of the Mugdhabodha grammar. The Muktāphala embodies the philosophy of the Bhagavata purāṇa in 19 adhyāyas and 784 verses ( and a few lines in prose in 5th and 6th chapters ). Vopadeva was a friend and protege of Hemādri, who wrote several works at the encouragement of the latter. He says that he wrote the Harililā (published in the Calcutta Oriental Series No. 3), an index of the Bhāgavata for pleasing the minister Hemādri.1118 Verse 54 in the Upasamhārā dhyāya in the edition of the Muktāphala expressly states that Hemādri induced Vopadeva, son of the physician Kesava and pupil of the scholar Dhaneśa, to compose the Muktāphala. Verse 53 also is interesting:- TT TË THET (Arga: Tiga HTF: 949T ata: radar2007: II. Rāma means Dāśarathi Rāma and Rama candra (Yadava king). Hemādri means mountain Meru and also the author Hemādri. 120 

There is a learned commentary on the Raghuvamsa by a Hemādri. Mr. P. K. Gode (in ABORI vol. XIV pp. 126-128 ) adduces arguments for establishing that the commentator is different from the author of the Caturvarga-cintamani. There is a commentary on this work called Viveka with which both

Hemādri and Madhusudana-Sarasvati had something to do. 1121 Hemādri also wrote a commentary called Ayurvedarasāyana on the Astārgahṭdaya of Vāgbhata. 

Altogether Hemādri was a towering personality. His name is associated throughout the Maratha Country with the construc tion of numerous temples having a peculiar style of architecture. He is also credited with having invented the Modi script. Within a few decades his Caturvarga-cintamani, particularly its dāna and vrata sections, came to be looked upon as the standard work in the whole of the Deccan and southern India Madhava in his Kālanirṇaya (p. 67 ) expressly mentions the Vratakhanda of Hemādri as an authority. This work was composed about 1340 A. D. In an inscription of Bhāskara alias Bhavadūra, son of Bukka I, dated sake 1291 (i. e. 1369 A. D.) the king is described as making various gifts following the composition of Hemādri. 1122 This is obviously a reference to his danakhanda and establishes that long before 1369 A. D. Hemādri had become a standard author in the Telugu country. The Vanapalli plate of Anna-Vema dated sake 1300 (about 1380 A. D.) describes Vema as giving the various gifts in Hemādri and his son as one who observed the rratas and dānas 123 described by Hemādri. Pedda-Komati-Vema is described in a grant of sake 1344 as eager in bestowing gifts described in the rules of Hemādri. 1124 Hemadri is quoted in the Madanapārijāta,1125 the Dvaitanirṇaya of Saṅkarabhatta, the Nirṇayasindhu and other works.
