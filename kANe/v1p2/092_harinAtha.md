92. Harinātha 

Harinātha is the author of a digest called Smstisāra on several topics of dharmaśāstra. No part of this work has been yet printed. In the India Office there are two mss. of the Smstisāra (1. O. Cat. p. 448, No, 1488 and p. 449, No. 1489). The first cites 67 authorities ( pramāpakah) on Dharmaśāstra, out of which the Karmapradipa, the Kalpataru, the Kamadhenu, Kumāra, Gapeśvaramiśra, Vijñāneśvara, Vilamba (?), Smstimañjūsā and Haribara deserve special mention. This ms. contains the portion of the Smstisāra on the samskāras, rites on death, sraddha and

prayascitta. The other ms. deals with the principal topics of vivada ( various titles of law) and vyavahāra (judicial procedure), viz. partition, father's share on partition, larger share to the eldest son, persons excluded from partition and inheritance, impartible property; stridhana; the several kinds of sons; succession to the property of the sonless; re-union; gambling and prize-fighting and other titles of law; various methods of danda (punishment); the various units of measure etc.; judicial procedure i. e. the plaint, the reply, the means of proof, viz. documents, witnesses, posses sion, reasoning, oaths and ordeals; review of judgment; minority and dependence; rules about succession according to various authors. This last portion appears to be a sort of supplement, wherein the views of Balarūpa, Pārijāta, Halāyudha, Kalpataru and of the Smstisāra itself on the order of succession to a man dying sonless are set forth. Visvarūpa and Srikara are named in the summary of Bālarūpa's views and the Prakāśa at a later stage (folio 148 b). Bhavadeva-nibandha is also expressly named on possession. 

No information is given in the mss. about Harinatha himself. He is styled in the colophons 'mahamahopadhyāya.' In several places he refers to the views of the Gaudas on ācāra; e. g. he cites the view of the Gaudas that on a fasting day or sraddha day one should not employ the twig used in dantadhavana and that when there is Ekādasi on two days a house-holder should observe a fast on the first and a yati on the second. It appears that he was not a Gauda but rather a Maithil 1. 

The India Office ms. of the vivāda portion of the Smṛtisāra is dated sarnyat 1614 (i. e. 1558 A. D.). Another ms. of the same portion (vide Mitra's Notices, vol. V, p. 232, No. 1913 ) was copied in Laksmana samvat 363 i. e. 1469-1470 A. D. Śūlapāni quotes the Smstisāra in his Durgotsavaviveka. Misarumiśra in his Vivadacandra several times refers to the opinions of the Smrtisāra.1163 Hence it follows that the Smrtisāra was composed

before the last quarter of the 14th century. Candesvara in bis voluminous work nowhere refers to Harinātha nor does the latter refer to him. Hence they were probably contemporaries or not separated by any appreciable interval of time. As Harinātba mentions the Kalpataru and Harihara, he must be later than about 1250 A. D. If Ganesvaramiśra116+ mentioned by Harinātha be the author of the Sugatisopāna (which is extremely probable) who was an uncle of Candeśvara, then Harinātha cannot be earlier than about 1300 A, D. Harinātha is mentioned in the Danda viveka p. 251 and on p. 326 and the latter refers to the author of Smstisāra on pp. 141, 197, 282, 284. Raghunandana in Smṛti tattva, (vol. I) Tithi p. 85, criticizes the meaning of Vāruna given by Harinātha ; Prayaścitta p. 536 (mentioned as Harinātho pādhyāya ); Vol. II. Ekādasi pp. 7, 105, Udvaha p. 108, Suddhi tattva 240 (as against Bhavadevabhatta ). The Smstisāra is several times mentioned as an authority in the Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara (Benares S. Series on pp. 14, 48, 50 ), who is fre quently mentioned by Raghunandana in the Smstitattva ( vol. I.) Tithi pp. 136, 137, 186, Sraddba p. 226, Prayascitta p. 542. The Smstisāra is mentioned by the Vivādacintāmanil165 by Vācaspati mjīra (on p. 36 of the edtion of 1837). Therefore Harinātha flourished sometime between 1300-1400 A. D. 

There are several works styled Smṛtisāra e. g. of Keśava Śarmā ( Mitra's Notices, vol. II. p. 76 ), of Yadavabhūṣana-bhattā cārya ( Mitra's Notices, vol. IV p. 213 No. 1642 ), of Devayājñika (D. C. Ms. No. 266 of 1884-87 and 344 of 1886-92, the latter being called Smṛtisārasa ngraha). Hence it often becomes difficult to say in the case of later works, what particular Smstisāra is being quoted.
