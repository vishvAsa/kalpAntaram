117. Kāśīnātha-Upādhyāya 

Kasinātha Upadhyāya or Bābā Padhye composed an extensive work called Dharmasindhusāra or Dharmābdhisāra, which is popularly known as Dharmasindhu. It is now the leading work in matters of religious observances in the Deccan and has been referred to even in judicial decisions. 1526 It has been published several times. In the following the Nirnayasagara edition of 1936 has been used. He says that he consulted former nibandhas and, following the order of the subject-matters in the Nirnaya sindhu, composed the work which sets forth only the establi shed conclusions after eliminating the original smsti texts.1537

He ( Kāśinātha Upadhyāya) expressly mentions Madhavā. cārya in the Introductory verse (3) and states that he consulted former nibandhas such as the Nirnayasindhu that establish con clusions ( in matters of Dharma). He sometimes employs the very words of the Nirṇayasindhu as, for instance, on defining Vaisnava and Smārta. 

The following are among the principal authors and works mentioned by the Dharmasindhu : Akhandadarśa, Agnipurāṇa, Kalatattvavivecana (frequently ), Kaustubha ( frequently), Gphyā gnisāgara, Puruṣārthacintamani, Parijāta, Pūrtakamalākara, Bhaktinirnaya, Bhattoiidiksita, Bhāskararāya (described as Navinatara on p. 77), Mahārnava, Mādhava, Muhūrta-Cintā. mani, Muhurtamārtaṇḍa, Ramarcanacandrikā, Santimayukha, śāntisāra, Śūdrakamalakara, Śrāddhasāgara, Sāpindyadipikā. 

The Dharmasindhu is divided into three paricchedas (sections) and contains 433 closely printed pages (in the Nir. ed. of 1936). The first pariccheda covers 34 pages and deals with the divisions of the year, seasons, months ( lunar, solar, savana, nāksatra, Bārhaspatya ), discussion on matters to be avoided on certain days and tithis and to be performed on them. The 2nd pari ccheda ( covering pp. 35-116 ) deals with religious acts to be done in the several months from Caitra onwards to Phālguna and p. 115 states that authoritative texts should be found from works like Kaustubha, Nirnayasindhu, and those of Madhava. The third pariccheda is divided into two parts, the first covering pp, 117–314 and the second covering pp. 315-433. The first part of the third parichheda deals with the Samskāras from Garbhadhāna onwards. In each case it starts with the considera tion of proper times (months, tithis, the week days, the astro logical yogas ) and discusses the results of eclipses, night, even ing and other times for different acts; Nārāyanabali, Nāgabali, listening to the recitation of Harivamśa, adoption of a son and discussion about the gotra of an adopted son and his sapiṇda relationship; other rites like punisarana, șasthīpājana, Śānti such

Kāsinātha was a very learned man and a great devotee of God Vithoba at Pandharpur in the Sholapur District. He wrote several other works such as the Prayascittendusekhara (Bühler 3. 110), an exposition of the Vedastuti in the Bhagavatapurana (X. 87) and a work called Vitthala-rimantrasārabhasya.1538 In the latter he takes several Rk verses ( such as Rgveda I. 95. 1-11 and I. 164.31) and explains them as applying to God Vitthala.1sti 

We know a good deal about the family of Kāśinātha Padhye from his own works and from the biography of the great 

Marathi poet Moropant published by Mr. L. R. Pangarkar (ed. of 1908, chap. 16 pp. 107–119). His family hailed from Golavali, a village in the Ratnagiri District. They were Karhada Brah maṇas and had the Joshi and Upadhye vștti of seventy-two villages in the Sangameśvara taluka of the Ratnagiri District. At the end of the Dharmasindhu he says that his grandfather

He propc unds certain general principles of the interpretation of Vedic verses and applies them to seveval verses of the Rgveda. Reasons of lack of space forbid further remarks. This work richly deserves to be printed and published.

was Kāśyupadhyāya who had two sons Yajñeśvara and Ananta. Ananta was a very pious man and a great devotee and left his native land Konkana, and resided at Pandharpur on the Bhima. The Dharmasindhu does not give the reason for Ananta's migration from Konkaṇa. But it is said that the Padhyes bad a dispute with another family about the upadhye vrtti, took it for decision to the Peshwa's Court at Pouna and were defeated, on which they cursed the Peshwa, vowed not to stay in the territories under the Peshwa's rule and migrated to Pandharpur. Vide \#1. 5. H. H.for sake 1833 p. 100 for the judgement deli vered in 1762 A. D. in the dispute between Joshi and Padhye. The Dharmasindhu was composed 1630 in sake 1712 i. e. 1790–1 A. D. Kāśinātha was related to the great Marathi poet Moro pant, as his daughter Avadi was married to Ramakrśṇa, the second son of the poet. He had great veneration for Moropant and refers to the Mantrabhagavata of the latter.1531 Kasinātha became a samnyāsin and died in sake 1727 i. e. 1805-6 A. D.1582
