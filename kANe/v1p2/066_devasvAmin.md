66. Devasyamin The Smṛticandrikā tells us that Devasvā min composed like Srīkara and Sambhu a work in the nature of a digest of smrtis (smrtisamuccaya ). Vide note 748 above. The com mentary of Nārāyana of the Naidhruva gotra, son of Divākara, on the Asvalāyanagrhyasūtra788 says that it relies upon the bhāsya of Devasvāmin on the same work Gārgya Nārāyana, son of Narasimha, in bis commentary on the Asvalāyana srautasūtra, tells us that he follows the bhāsya of Devasvāmin thereon. It is hardly likely that two writers of the same name flourished about the same time. Hence it may be assumed that Devasvāmin wrote bhāsyas on the Āśvalāyana Srauta and Gșhya sūtras and a digest of smṛtis, where he discussed all topics of dharma, such as ācāra, vyavahāra, āśauca &c. The commentary of Bhattoji789 on the Caturviṇsati mata refers to the view of Devasvāmin on sraddha and āśauca. Hemādri780 ( vol. III, part 2, p. 324 ) and Madhava (on Parāśara, vol. I, part 2, p. 328 ) also quote Devasyāmin. The Smṛticandrikā quotes the views of Devasvāmin on vyavahāra

and aśauca several times. For example, Devasvāmin791 ex plained the woru Yautaka differently from the Nigbantu ( which explained it as the wealth that was given to a woman when she was seated on the same seat with her husband at the time of marriage ). Devasvāmin explained that the word of the Samgraha792 that, when a son was born to one of several full brothers, he stood as a son to all and that the same rule applied to several co-wives when one of them had a son, meant that in both cases another son should not be adopted. Devasvāmin held the view ( like Bhojadeva ) that the word 'duhitr'in Yājñavalkya's verses on succession meant putrika.793 Devasvāmin explained Manu794 9. 141 ag saying that the adopted son ( in the particular case mentioned by Manu ) took all the wealth and the gotra of his adoptive father. Vide Smrticandrika ( Mysore ed.) on asauca p. 22. The Vaijayantī of Nandapandita (on Visṇu 22. 32 ) quotes the view of Devasvāmin that on the death of unmarried daughters mourning was to be observed for ten days.195 The

( II, p. 289 ) says 'तस्य पूर्वोक्तेन सहाविरोधाय देवखामिना तात्पर्यार्थ उक्तः उभयत्र नान्यः प्रतिनिधिः कार्य इति ग्रन्थेन'. The same words occur in the स. वि.

Smrticandrikā quotes a verse from Devasvāmin796 on śrāddha also. 

In the Prapancahrdaya ( Tri. S. series, p. 39 ) we are told that Devasvāmin composed a brief gloss on the 12 adhyāyas of the Pūrvamīmāṁsāsūtra and the four adhyāyas of the Samkarsakānda, seeing that the bhāsyas of Bodhāyana and Upavarsa were vast. The Govt. collection of Mss. at Madras has Devasvāmin's bhāsya on the Samkarsakānda ( vide Tri. Cat. vol. III, part I, Sanskrit C, p. 3841). There are not sufficient data available to establish the identity of this writer with Devasvāmin, the writer on dharmaśāstra. 

As the Smsticandrikā quotes Devas vāmin so profusely, he cannot be later than 1150 A. D. His earlier limit can be determined in several ways. Gārgya Nārāyana's comment on Āśvalāyanaśrauta (II. 1. 14 ) is quoted by Trikāndamandapa, who is himself (quoted by Hemādri. Therefore Gārgya Nārāyana could not have flourished later than 1100 A.D. ( vide Bhandarkar’s Report on search for mss., 1883-84, pp. 30-31 ). Therefore Devasvāmin probably flourished about 1000-1050 A. D., if not earlier. The fact that Devasvamin held certain views similar to Bhojadeva's also corroborates the chronological position thus assigned to him.
