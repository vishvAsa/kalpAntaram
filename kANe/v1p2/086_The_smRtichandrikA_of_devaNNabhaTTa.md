86. The Smṛticandrikā of Devannabhatta This is a well-known digest on Dharmaśāstra. An English translation of the portion of it which is concerned with dāyabhāga was published in 1867 by T. Krisnasvami Iyer at Madras. The text has been published by Mr. J. R. Gharpure ( up to śrāddha) in Bombay and also in the Mysore Government Oriental Series ( up to āśauca ). In the following Mr. Gharpure's edition has been used and the Mysore edition for āśauca section. 

The Smsticandrikā published by Mr. Gharpure is a huge work of large size covering about 736 pages on the topics of some samskāras (88 pages ), Ahnika ( 144 pages ), Vyavahāra ( 332 pages ), and Sraddha ( 172 pages ). According to the colo phons at the end of the sections, it appears that the author was called Devapna-bhattopadhyāya, son of Keśavāditya-bhattopā dhyāya. The fifth introductory verse asserts that all that he writes is based on authoritative texts and that he has stated noth ing purely relying on his own ideas (or imagination ).1068

History of Dharmaśāstra 

The Smsticandrika is a very extensive digest. It is almost the earliest (except the Kalpataru ) among digests on dharmaśāstra of which mss. have yet been discovered. The printed text deals with the topics (kāndas ) of Samskara, Ahnika, Vyavahāra, Srāddha, Asauca. It appears that he worte on prāyaścitta also. In the colophons of mss. of the work the name of the author is variously written as Devansa, Devana, Devananda or Devagaña (vide 1. O. Cat. pp. 405-406 ). He is also described therein as the son of Keśavadityabhatta and as a Somayāji. 

The Smsticandrikā quotes most profusely from numerous smrtikāras and affords valuable assistance in reconstructing some of the smstis and checking mss. and editions thereof. For example, it quotes about 600 verses from Kātyāyana on vyavahāra and about the same number from Bṛhaspati. From Manu and Nārada more verses are quoted than even from Kātyāyana and Bșhaspati. Among works, commentators and authors of digests named by it the following may be noted : Aparārka, Karmapradipa which is the same as Gobhilasmīti ( II. 126-127) with slight variations (Anand. ed.), Devarāta, Devasvāmi, Apastambakalpabhāsyār thakāra (Asauca p. 84), Dhāreśvara, Dharmabhāṣya, Dhūrtasvāmi, Pradipa, Bhavanātha, Bhāṣya on Apastamba Dharmasūtra, Dharmadipa or Pradipa ( Asauca p. 63), Bhāsyārthasamgraha kāra, Manuvṛtti, Medhātithi, Mitākṣarā, Rāmāyana (four verses), and Varahamihira (one verse), Vaijayanti ( a lexicon ), Viśvarūpa, Viśvadarsa ( Asauca p. 164 ), Sambhu, Srikara, Sivasvāmi, Smsti bhāskara, Smṛtyarthasara. He mentions a Bhattācārya on Asauca (p. 1,2), probably Śrinivāsa, the author of Suddhidipikā who worte about 1159-60 A. D. (JASB 1915 p. 334 ). He quotes a passage from the work of an author, whom he styles Guru (proba bly his own teacher or father ). 1067 The Smsticandrikā often criti cizes these works and authors and advances its own views after considering the positions of others. Devarnabhatta was a south ern writer and his work is according to judicial decisions of great authority in southern India,1068 But it has been held that in

spite of its high authority it cannot override the Mitākṣarā even in the Madras Presidency.1069 

The Smṛticandrikā quotes from 23 Purāṇas and Upapurāṇas i. e. from more Purāṇas than even Apasārka. They are set out in the note below.1070 

For the Asauca-kānda of the Sms. C. I had to use the Mysore University's edition of 1921 (203 pages ). It starts with the verse of Sarkha that the following religious acts are stopped while the āśauca (impurity on account of death ) exists, viz. religious gifts and their acceptance, homa (worship of Fire ), study of the Veda and rites for one's deceased ancestor (except the offering of pindas to the recently dead person for whose sake asauca is observed ). It quotes immediate performance of purificatory rite for one day, three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fortnight, a month and until death. It deals with impu rity on birth also and concludes with the putting into the Ganges or some holy place the ashes of the dead and with Sraddha at Gaya. 

The contents of the Smsticandrikā are : various Dharmas, such as those of varnas, āśramas; usages of countries; samskāras, garbha-dbāna, puṁsavana, jātakarma, nāmakarana, cūdākarana, upanayana, marriage, etc., duties of student-hood and holidays; daily duties such as sauca, ācamana, brushing the teeth, bath ing, samdhya, śrauta and smārta rites; duties of householder ; the five daily yajñas; rules about taking food, forbidden food; proce dure of law-courts, means of proof, ordeals, the various titles of law such as deposit, partnership, dāyabhāga; detailed rules about sraddha, its various kinds, persons entitled to perform sraddhas, the brahmanas proper to be invited at śrāddha etc.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

The Smsticandrikā refers to Vijñāneśvara with great respect.1071 Yet there are several interesting points on which the Smsticandrika differs from the Mitākṣarā. The Smsticandrika questions ( vide note 825 above) the statement of the Mit. that unequal distribu tion by the father of ancestral property among his sons should not be resorted to, as it has come to be abhorred by the people. The Smsticandrikā does not approve of the definition of daya given by the Mit.1072 The Smxticandrika does not accept Vijnanesvara's explanation of the word 'apratisthitā' occurring in the sūtra of Gautama, but upholds Apararka's explanation of it (vide note 1031 above). The Smrticandrika favours the theory of spiritual benefit in matters of succession and therefore among daughters prefers one that has sons over another daughter who is sonless.1078 It criticizes the reasons advanced by the Mit. for preferring the mother over the father as an heir to their deceased son and says that both parents succeed together.1074 Though the Smsticandrika in this way in some cases criticizes the Mit., it generally follows its lead. It holds, just as the Mit. does, that sons acquire by birth ownership in ancestral property. The author asserts that he puts forward no imaginary views but only such views as are based on (authoritative) texts.1075 

As the Smsticandrikā names the Mit., Aparārka and Smrtyar. thasara, its upper limit cannot be placed earlier than 1150 A. D.

The Smsticandrikā of Devannabhatļa 

741 

Their Lordships of the Privy Council say in Buddhasingh vs Laltu singh1076 that Devanandabhatta is supposed to have been a contemporary of Aparārka. But this supposition is not quite correct. Since Aparārka is quoted several times as an authority to be preferred even to the Mit., it looks more probable that there is some distance of time between Aparārka and Devanna bhatta. Hemādri quotes the views of the Smṛticandrikā probably oftener than those of any other nibandhakāra. In one place1077 he does not approve of the explanation given by the Smsticandrika of a verse occurring in the Mahabharata about a man with male issue performing sraddha on the thirteenth tithi. In an other!078 place Hemādri refers to the view of the Smrticandrikā on the question whether the śrāddha on amāvāsyā is optional with śraddha in dark half. Therefore it follows that the Smsticandrikā must have been composed at least a generation earlier than Hemādri i. e. before 1225 A. D. The Smsticandrika is frequently quoted by the Sarasvativilāsa, the Viramitrodaya and other digests. 

Several authors composed works styled Smrticandrika, e. g. there is a Smrticandrikā of Sukadeva-miśra ( I. O. Cat. p. 471 No. 1549), another by Ápadeva (Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 301 ), another by Vamadevabhattācārya (Mitra's Notices, vol. IX. p. 137 ).

III. 2. p. 482; the स्मृतिच० does quote the text of the महाभारत and remarks, 'अवश्य Forfata a fra R : ' p. 369. The passage is found in Anuśā sana 87, 16 ( Bombay edition) and is read as 'avasyam tu
