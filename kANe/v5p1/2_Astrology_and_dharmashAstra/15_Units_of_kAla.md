CHAPTER XV

## Units of Kāla

We shall now turn to the units of time from _yuga_ backwards to muhūrta, leaving aside _Manvantara, Kalpa and Pralaya_ for the moment.

The word 'yuga' occurs at least 33 times in the Ṛgveda and appears to have been used in several senses. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 886-890. Two senses stand out as prominent, viz. a short period or a very long period. For the first sense we may cite Ṛg. I. 158. 6 ( 'Dīrghatamas, the son of Mamatā, became old in the 10th Yuga, he became brahmā high priest and leader of the waters flowing to their goal'.[^699] Here yuga cannot mean a period of more than ten years and probably means a period of five years; in Ṛg. III. 26.3 we read 'like a neighing horse by its mother, Vaiśvānara ( Agni) is kindled by the Kuśikas in each yuga'; vide Ṛg. 111.55.18.[^700] In the Vedāṅgajyotiṣa [^701] (verses 1 and 5 ) yuga is said to comprise five years. There is nothing to prevent us from taking this sense in the two passages cited from the Ṛgveda. In R̥g. III. 55.18 it is possible to recognize a recondite reference to five year units of time each divided into six seasons. In the Ṛgveda _saṁvatsara_ means a year in several passages such as I. 110. 4, I. 140.2, I. 161. 13, I. 164. 44, VII, 103. 1, 7, 9, X. 190.2. In R̥g. X, 87. 17 we have the derivative form 'Saṁvatsariṇa'[^702] from saṁvatsara 'O Agni that observest what men do! May the demon possessing magic devices not partake of the cow's milk that springs after a year'.

[^699]: दीर्घतमा मामतेयो जुजुर्वान्दशमे युगे । अपामर्थे यतीनां ब्रह्मा भवति सारथिः । ऋ. I. 158.6; अश्वो न क्रन्दञ्जनिभिः समिध्यते वैश्वानरः कुशिकेभिर्युगे युगे। ऋ. III. 26. 3; सायण explains 'युगेयुगे as प्रतिदिनम्'।. vide बृहद्देवता IV. 24ff for the story of दीर्घतमस्.

[^700]: वरिस्य नु स्वश्र्व्यं जनासःप्रनुवोचाम विदुरस्य देवाः । षोह्र्ळा युक्ताः पञ्चपञ्चा वहन्ति महद्देवानामसुरत्वमेकम् ॥ ऋ. III. 55. 18. Here वीरस्य refers to Indra and the 2nd half means 'groups of five years bring him in six ways' i.e. groups of five years (युग) each divided into six seasons.

[^701]: पञ्चसंवत्सरमयं युगाध्यक्षं प्रजापतिम् । वेदाङ्गज्योतिष, verse 1; माघशुक्लप्रपन्नस्य पौषकृष्णसमापिनः । युगस्य पञ्चवर्षस्य कालज्ञानं प्रचक्षते ॥ibid. verse 5.

[^702]:संवत्सरीणं पय उस्रियायास्तस्य माशीद्यातुधानो नृचक्षः। ऋ. x. 87. 17. (=अथर्ववेद VIII. 3. 17). Probably there is _double entendre_ here, one meaning being 'May no magician prevent us from having all cows' milk that would be ours for a year ( after the cow is calved )'; the other is 'may not a demon hold up the water that falls down after a year': उस्रिया means a cow and may also mean a cloud. Vide ऋ. III. 55. 13 where a cloud is referred to as cow or its udder. पाणिनि (V. 1. 91-92) has two sutras to explain संवत्सरीण and परिवत्सरीण 'वत्सरान्ताच्छश्छन्दसि । संपरिपूर्वात्स्व च।'.

## Ṛgveda meaning of yuga

In R̥g. X. 62.2 we have the word _parivatsara_ 'those ancestors that shattered Vala by righteousness and forced out the wealth consisting of cows' and in R̥g. VII, 103.8 the word 'parivatsarīṇa'. Saṁvatsara and Parivatsara are two of the five names bestowed on the five years of a yuga in the other saṁhitās. Just as the word yuga was used in several senses even in the Ṛgveda it is quite possible that the words 'Saṁvatsara' and 'parivatsara' meant simply year and also successive years of a cycle of five years. In the Tai. S. (V. 5. 7. 1–3 ) _namaskāra_ ( salutation) is offered to Rudra with Saṁvatsara, to his bow towards the right with Parivatsara, to his bow behind with Idāvatsara, to the bow towards the north with Iduvatsara and to the bow above with Vatsara. The Vāj. S. ( 27. 45 ) names these five separately with Idāvatsara in place of Iduvatsara; similarly, in Atharva VI. 55.3 salutation is offered to Idāvatsara, Parivatsara and Saṁvatsara. In Tai. Br. (1. 4. 10.1 [^703] ) Agni, Aditya, Candramas and Vāyu are identified with Saṁvatsara, Parivatsara, Idāvatsara and Anuvatsara and it should be noticed that the four names of years are brought in close relation to the four cāturmāsyas, viz. Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapraghāsa, Sākamedha and Śunāsiriya. Thus even in the Saṁhitās names (generally five ) are mentioned in a certain fixed order. There is no reason why this should be so unless they formed a fixed series in a cycle. Thibaut in his Grundriss (p. 9) hammers on the fact that sometimes only two or three or four out of the five are mentioned and argues (rather obstinately ) that knowledge of the five year yuga cannot be assumed for the Vedic times. It should be noted that Kauṭilya speaks of the yuga of five Saṁvatsaras and of the insertion of two intercalary months, one at the end of 2 1/2 years and the other at the end of five years. [^704]

[^703]: अग्निवार्व संवत्सरः। आदित्यः परिवत्सरः। चन्द्रमा इदावत्सरः। वायुः पुनरनुवत्सरः। यद्वैश्वदेवेन यजते। अग्निमेव तत्संवत्सरमाप्नोति। तस्माद्वैश्वदेवेन यजमानः संवन्सरीणां स्वस्तिमाशास्त इत्याशासीत । यद्वरुणप्रघासैर्यजते । आदित्यमेव तत्परिवत्सरमाप्नोति। ...यत्साकमेधैर्यजते चन्द्रमसमेव तदिदावत्सरमाप्नोति। ...यत्पितृयज्ञेन यजते देवानेव तदन्ववस्यति। अथवा अस्य वायुश्वानुवत्सरश्वाप्रीनावुच्छिष्येते। यच्छुनासीरीयेण यजते वायुमेव तदनुवत्सरमाप्नोति। तै. ब्रा. I. 4.10.1-3.

[^704]: पंचसंवत्सरो युगमिति ।... एवमर्धतृतीयानामब्दानामधिमासकम् । ग्रीष्मे जनयतः पूर्वे पञ्चाब्दान्ते च पश्चिमम् ॥ अर्थशास्त्र II. chap. 20 (देशकालमान) p. 109.

The Mahābhārata knows of the yuga of five years [^705] (in Sabhāparva 11. 38). The Pitāmahasiddhānta,[^706] which is not extant now, stated, according to the Pañcasiddhāntikā of Varāhamihira, that yuga means five years of the Sun and the Moon and that an intercalary month was added after thirty months.

The next question is: what was the extent of the year in the Vedic age. Some R̥k. verses may be cited in this connection. 'The wheel [^707] of r̥ta has twelve spokes; it revolves round the heavens; it does never wear out. O Agni! in this ( wheel) seven hundred and twenty sons in pairs abide. Some say that the father (Sun) who sends down water has five feet and twelve forms and remains endowed with fulness in the distant half (part) of heavens while others say that he ( the Sun), the all-seeing, is placed in a lower ( place) that has seven wheels and six spokes; all the worlds abide in the revolving wheel with five spokes; one wheel and twelve rims ( of the wheel) and three naves-who is there that knew these ( thoroughly ); in that ( wheel i.e. year) are placed together three hundred and sixty very unstable nails' (R̥g. I. 164. 11-13 and 48 ). In these passages the sage poses a riddle or puzzle in very metaphorical and mystic language about a year divided into three, five or six seasons, twelve months, 360 days and 720 days and nights (when calculated separately). It is possible to hold that the wheel of r̥ta means the zodiacal belt divided into twelve parts ( dvādaśāra ). But it is a very difficult matter to keep in view the twelve divisions correctly.

[^705]: क्षणा लवा मुहूर्ताश्च दिवारात्रिस्तथैव च। अर्धमासाश्च मासाश्च ऋतवः षट् च भारत॥ संवत्सराः पञ्चयुगमहोरात्रश्चतुर्विधः । सभा 11. 37-38.

[^706]: रविशशिनोः पञ्च युगं वर्षाणि पितामहोपदिष्टानि। अधिमास्रिंशद्भिर्मासैरवमो द्विषष्टया तु ॥ पञ्चासि. XII. I. Acc. to वराह, the पैतामहसिद्धान्त employed sake 2 ( 80 A.D.) as its epoch i.e. a new yuga began with saka year 2 ( elapsed). It is therefore probable that it was composed about 80 A.D.

[^707]: द्वादशारं नहि तज्जराय वर्वति चक्रं परि द्यामृतस्य। आ पुत्रा अग्ने मिथुनासो अत्र सप्त शतानि विंशतिश्च तस्थुः॥ पञ्चपादं पितरं द्वादशाकृतिं दिव आहुः परे अर्धे पुरीषिणम् । अथेमे अन्य उपरे विचक्षणं सप्तचके षळर आहुरर्पितम् ॥ पञ्चारे चक्रे परिवर्तमाने तस्मिन्ना तस्थुर्भुवनानि विश्वा। ......द्वादश प्रधयश्चक्रमेकं त्रीणि नभ्यानि क उ तच्चिकेत । तस्मिन्त्साकं त्रिशता न शङ्कवोऽर्पिताः षष्टिर्न चलाचलासः॥ ऋ I. 164. 11, 12, 13, 48. The whole hymn R̥g. I. 164 is full of riddles. In R̥g. I. 164. 2 it is said that seven horses aro yoked to a chariot (the Sun) that has only one wheel but three naves. The wheel means the year, three naves would be three seasons, summer, rains, winter. The wheel is also said in verses 12 and 13 to have six spokes or five spokes; the twelve spokes or rims of wheel (pradhi) represent months. Vide निरुक्त IV. 27 for explanations of these verses; compare आदिपर्व  3.60 for a verse similar to Rg 1. 164. 11-13.

## Ṛgveda references to year and its extent

In R̥g. I. 164. 15 it is said 'They say that the 7th of those that are born together is born of one; there are only six twin sages born of the gods'. Here there is a reference to seasons, six of which have two months each, the 7th has only one ( viz. 13th or intercalary month ) and that the 13th month is not fit for religious rites. The Atharvaveda V. 35. 4 [^708] also states that Saṁvatsara has twelve spokes and the months have 30 spokes. This explains R̥g. I. 164. 11-13 and 48. In the Brāhmaṇas also the year is said to have 360 days and 720 days and nights together; Śatapatha IX. I. 1. 43, Ait. Br. VII. 7 also say the [^709] same. We have also to recognize that the Vedic saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas speak of a 13th month that was intercalated. About Varuṇa the Ṛgveda says [^710] 'He knows the twelve months with their progeny (the days ) and also the month that is added.' The Tai. S. (IV. 6. 7. 1-2) refers to a year of twelve months and also of 13 months. The Kauṣitaki Br. 19. 2 speaks of the 13th month. The Tai. S. ( I. 14. 4, VI. 5. 3. 4 ) expressly mentions the 13th month called ' Saṁsarpa or Aṁhaspatya'. It is called Aṁhasaspati in Vaj.s, (VII. 30 and XXII. 31) and Saṁsarpa in Maitrāyaṇi S. III. 12. 13. The Kauṣitaki Brāhmaṇa connects the 13th month with the Śunāsiriya sacrifice[^711]. The Maitrāyaṇi saṁhita (I. 10.8) draws a distinction between a r̥tuyāji and cāturmāsya-yāji, the former being one who offers sacrifice thinking 'now Vasanta has started, rainy season has started, _śarad_ has started while the Cāturmāsya-yāji is one who offers sacrifice in view of the 13th month'. [^711a]

I.1. 43. Here the additional month is said to have been of 35days. This was probably another way of adjusting the Savana year of 360 days to the solar year of 365 days and about a quarter more. In six such years about 6 days for each year appear to have been calculated and added as a 13th month of 35 days.

Vide a very informing paper in Acta Orientalia, vol. IV (1926) pp.124-133 on 'the 13th month in ancient Hindu chronology' by B. Faddegon of Amsterdam, in which the learned writer tries to explain Maitrāyaṇi saṁhita 1. 10. 8 and certain passages from the Lātyāyana-śrauta-sūtra and the Nidānasūtra which appear to have puzzled Weber and Thibaut.

How and when the month was inserted in the Ṛgveda times or the times of the Tai. S. is not clear. What is clear is that one whole month was added. Therefore, Thibaut overstates the case when he asserts emphatically (Grundriss p. 7) that all Vedic texts agree that the year was exclusively of 360 days. A year in which one month was added ( i.e. of 390 days) was also well-known to the Ṛgvedic Indians. Therefore, in order to explain the facts we have here probably to postulate two calendars, one a purely sacrificial (or religious) of 360 days (12 months of 30 days ) probably inherited by the Vedic Indians from their ancestors about whom we know next to nothing, and another calendar where a month was added in order to bring the year in line with visible astronomical data. It is known that the ancient Egyptians [^712] had an official calendar of 360 days ( 12 months of 30 days each ) plus five days added at end i.e. of 365 days only and no intercalary day was inserted in a year. The result was that the opening day of this calendar would shift back through the solar year until a whole cycle of that year had been completed in 1456 or 1506 years. This calendar called sliding calendar was in use for about 3000 years in Egypt from proto-dynastic period until the Roman period. There was also another calendar against which this sliding calendar moved. A year of 360 days ( divided into 12 months of 30 days each ) was not peculiar to ancient Vedic India nor to ancient Egypt, but played an important role also in Mesopotamia, which had a strictly lunar calendar.

[^712]: Vide 'Origins of Egyptian calendar' in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 1. p 396-398 ( by Prof. Neugebauer ); 'the Legacy of Egypt by S. R, K, Glanville (Oxford, 1942) pp. 2-5; 'Origin of ancient Egyptian calendar' by H. E. Winlock in Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 83 (1940) pp. 447-463, particularly 460-463; 'Burden of Egypt' by J. A. Wilson (Chicago ) p. 30; 'Calendars of ancient Egypt' by R. A, Parker (Chicago, 1953 ), where p. 56 says that from about 2500 B, C. Egyptians had three calendars all of which continued to be in use to the very end of pagan Egypt.

## Length of months in Vedic times

The co-existence of months of various lengths for later times is vouchsafed by the Arthaśāstra p. 108 (Sham Shastri's ed. of 1919 ). A year of 360 days was in later times in India called a _Sāvana_ one (from 'savana' meaning extracting of soma juice in a sacrifice ) and a month was added after about 30 months to bring the lunar year (of 354 days) in line with the solar year.

In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (II. 1. 3. 2.) [^713] the Sun's apparent passage for six months in the north and for six months in the south is referred to, though the word _ayana_ is not employed in this passage. The word 'ayana' occurs in the sense of 'motion or path' in the Ṛgveda (āyan-n-āpo ayanam-icchamānāḥ, R̥g. III. 33.7). _Uttarāyaṇa_ and _Dakṣiṇāyana_ in later literature mean no more than the sun's ( apparent) motion or path in the northern celestial sphere and in the southern sphere respectively. The Sun's movement in the north for six months and in the south for six months is mentioned in Br. Up. VI. 2. 15-16 also. Thibaut (Grundriss p. 10 para 6 ) cites Kauṣitaki Br. 19. 3 as stating that the Sun stands still after it has gone for six months towards the south in order to turn again to the north and then observes that no one has a right to assume, from this statement in the Kauṣitaki [^714] Br. that for six months the Sun goes north or south, that the halves of the year are to be understood. What Thibaut is driving at is not clear to me. We have in this passage six months passages of the Sun in the north and also in the south. A year has ordinarily only twelve months. Therefore it must be assumed that halves of a year are meant. Thibaut does not explain what part of the year these six months in the north and south correspond to. Thibaut is probably swayed by the fact that in the Śatapatha and elsewhere Vasanta, Grīsma and Varṣā are lumped together as the seasons (rtus ) for the gods but Uttarāyaṇa does not exactly correspond with these three stus. That may be so, but the rule or maxim is that names are given on the basis of what is principal or eminent (_prādhānyena vyapadeśā bhavanti_).

[^713]: स यत्रोदगावर्तते देवेषु तर्हि भवति। ...यत्र दक्षिणावर्तते पितृषु तहिं भवति । शतपथ II. 3. 2. 3.

[^714]: सवै माघस्यांमावास्यायामुपवसत्युदङङावर्त्स्यन्नुपेमे वसन्ति। ...स षण्मासानुदङ्ङित्वा तिष्ठते । दक्षिणावर्त्स्यन्नुपेमे वसन्ति वैषुवतीयेनाह्वा। कौषीतकि ब्रा० 19.3. . This shows that the winter solstice, when the sun is farthest from the equator and appears to pause or rest before turning towards the north, occurred on the amavāsyā of Māgha.

Vasanta and Griṣma are important parts of Uttarāyaṇa; therefore, by association with these two and for the sake of symmetry _varṣā_ is also held to be a _ṛtu_ for the gods.

As regards the seasons, there are varying statements. In R̥g. I. 15 the word 'ṛtunā' occurs several times, but once we have 'ṛtūn' also 'O Indra' drink Soma according to the seasons from the wealth (i.e. the richly filled vessel) of the brāhmaṇa.' R̥g. II, 36 and 37 are styled Ṛtavya hymns. The Ṛgveda itself names five seasons, viz. Vasanta (X. 161. 4, X. 90.6), Grīṣma (X. 90.6), Prāvṛs ( VII. 103.3 and 9 ), Śarad (over 25 times, as in II, 12, 11, VII. 66.11, X. 161.4), Hemanta ( X. 161.4), but the R̥g. does not expressly mention Śiśira. Three seasons are metaphorically meant in R̥g. I. 164. 48 and six in R̥g. I, 164. 15. The Atharvaveda [^714a] ( VI. 55.2 ) mentions all the six, but not in the usual order. The Ait. Br. says that the year has five ṛtus[^715] by putting together Hemanta and Śiśira. The Maitrāyaṇi Sam. in I. 7. 3 speaks of Saṁvatsara as having five ṛtus and again as having six ṛtus and the Śat. Br. (II. 1.3.16 ) says that saṁvatsara comprises six ṛtus. In Śatapatha XII. 8.2.33 the ṛtus are said to be three viz. Griṣma, Varṣa and Hemanta and in the very next passage they are said to be six. There is mention of seven ṛtus in Atharvaveda VI. 61.2. But one should not be puzzled by this. The 7th ṛtu is probably meant to represent the 13th intercalary month as it is expressly mentioned in Atharva. (V.6.4). Thibaut surprisingly asserts that the lists of the names of the seasons are only priestly inventions and the Vedic texts exhibit no practical use for them (Grundriss p. 11). Thibaut appears to be obsessed with the influence of priests and offers no good reasons why the names should be regarded as inventions and not as correctly registering what was current in the then society. In Tai. S.[^716] IV. 4.11.1 the six ṛtus with two months for each are mentioned. Vasanta is mentioned as the first of ṛtus (mukham vā etad-ṛtūnāṁ yad-vasantaḥ) in Tai. Br. I. 1.2.6.

[^714a]: ग्रीष्मो हेमन्तः शिशिरो वसन्तः शरद्वर्षाः स्विते नो दधात । अथर्व. VI. 55.2.

[^715]: पञ्चर्तवः संवत्सरस्य हेमन्तशिशिरयोः समानेन । ऐ. ब्रा. I. 1., often quoted as पञ्चर्तवः...समासेन.

[^716]: मधुश्च माधवश्च वासन्तिकावृतू शुक्रश्च शुचिश्व ग्रैष्मावृतू नभश्च नभस्यश्च वार्षिकावृतू इषश्वोर्जश्च शारदावृतू सहश्व सहस्यश्व हेमान्तिकावृतु तपश्च तपस्यश्च शैशिरावृतू । तै. सं. IV. 4.11.1. Pāṇini ( IV. 3. 18-21 ) appears to have this passage in view.

## Vedic references to seasons

The Śatapatha [^717] provides that Vasanta, Griṣma and Varṣā are the seasons of gods, Śarad, Hemanta and Śiśira are seasons of the pitṛs; similarly the bright half of a month, the day and the forenoon of a day are the times for gods and the dark half of a month, the night, the afternoon of a day are the times for pitṛs and it winds up with the prescription that a brāhmaṇa should consecrate the sacred fires in Vasanta, a kṣatriya in Grīṣma and a vaiśya in Śarad. [^718] At least as early as the edicts of Aśoka the words 'varṣa' (which etymologically means 'rains') and 'Saṁvatsara' are both used in the same sense viz. a year in the Brahmagiri inscription ( vide C.I. I. I. p. 175).

There are Western scholars that deny the knowledge of the planets to the Vedic Indians. But Thibaut (Grundriss p. 6) and Kaye (p. 33 ) both concede that it is inconceivable that the Vedic Indians did not observe and distinguish at least the larger planets in early times, but they contend that the Vedic passages cited as proving knowledge of the planets on the part of Vedic Indians cannot be accepted as evidence of the record of observations about planets and that the mere mention of the number seven or five ( about Ādityas in R̥g. X. 72. 8-9 or oxen ) cannot be relied upon. Both Thibaut and Kaye approach these problems with a peculiar mentality. Their criticism is mainly destructive and has a flavour of special pleading against things and ideas Indian. They hardly ever propose their own explanations of the disputed passages and when they rarely do they do not show how their explanations are more satisfactory than the ones they criticize. One typical case may be cited here. Almost all scholars agree that Kṛttikās are the same as Pleiades; but Kaye (Archaeological survey memoir No. 18 p. 24 and I. A. vol. 50, P. 45 ) appears to doubt this, yet he has not the goodness to say positively what other cluster Kṛttikās stand for and why.

[^717]: वसन्तो ग्रीष्मो वर्षाः। ते देवा ऋतवः । शरद्धेमन्तः शिशिरस्ते पितरो य एवापूर्यतेऽर्षमासः स देवा योऽपक्षीयते स पितरोऽहरेव देवा रात्रिः पितरः पुनरह्नः पूर्वाह्णो देवा अपराह्नो पितरः। ते वा एत ऋतवः। ...ब्राह्मणो वसन्त आदधीत । शतपथ II. 1.3.1-5.

[^718]: Vide Prof. Renou's article on 'Vedic ṛtus' in 'Indian Culture', vol. 15 pp. 21-26, where he endeavours to establish that ṛtu in the Ṛgveda has no restricted sense but means simply time or suitable time for sacrifice or sometimes 'rule or usage', and that 'ṛtunā' or 'ṛtubhiḥ' in the R̥g. means 'according to the division or distribution'. I demur to this conclusion. In some passages the meaning of ṛtu would have to be 'season.': for example in R̥g. I. 49,3 "O fair Uṣas !' winged birds, two-footed ( beings ) and four-footed (animals) go forth according the several seasons from the ends of the sky for thee (to meet thee)' (वयश्चित्ते पतत्रिणो द्विपच्चतुष्पदर्जुनि । उषः प्रारन्तृतुँरनु दिवोऽ अन्तेभ्यस्परि॥). Similarly, in R̥g. 1. 95.3 'ऋतून्' would have no connection with distribution or division.

The principal reason for the paucity of references to planets probably is that the cult of the worship of planets that we find well developed in Yāj. I. 295–308 had not yet arisen in Vedic times. At least Bṛhaspati (Jupiter ) appears to be clearly meant in two Vedic verses. 'Bṛahaspati, [^719] first appearing in the highest heaven of the great Luminary ( the Sun), destroyed darkness &c;' 'Bṛhaspati, when first appearing, rose in front of Tiṣya (Puṣya ) constellation'. 'The seven [^720] priests guard the dear and fixed seat of the bird (Agni) along with the five adhvaryus; oxen, going eat, ageless, delight in the east; the gods follow the ordinances of gods' (R̥g. III. 7.7.). Here the (five) oxen are taken to be the five planets. Similarly, 'He (Indra ) filled heaven and earth and the mid-region; he superintends in various ways the five gods, the 49 gods ( Maruts) at the proper seasons together with the thirty-four lights similar to his own but each according to the different ordinances governing each'[^721] ( R̥g. X. 55.3); 'these five oxen that stand in the midst of the great heaven' (R̥g. I. 105. 10).

[^719]: बृहस्पतिः प्रथमं जायमानो महो ज्योतिषः परमे व्योमन् । सप्तास्यस्तुविजातो रवेण वि सप्तरश्मिरधमत्तमांसि ॥ ऋ. IV. 50.4 = अथर्व 20.88.4; बृहस्पतिः प्रथमं जायमानस्तिष्यं नक्षत्रमभिसम्बभूव । श्रेष्ठो देवानां पृतनासु जिष्णुः दिशोऽनु सर्वा अभयं नो अस्तु ॥ तै. ब्रा. III. 1.1.5. तिष्य is the same as पुष्य and its presiding deity is बृहस्पति in ते. ब्रा. III. 1.1.5. तिष्य is the same as पुष्य and its presiding deity is बृहस्पति in तै. ब्रा. III. 1.1.5; even in such later works as गोभिलगृह्य III. 3.14 तैषी means पोषी (पौर्णमासी). तिष्य occurs in R̥g. V. 54.13 ( Treasure that does not fail as तिष्य does not form the heavens.) and X. 64.8 'we invoke the three times seven flowing rivers, the great waters, Kṛśānu, Tiṣya and Rudra'. सायण paraphrases the first as आदित्य and the second as नक्षत्र. Vide Fleet's interpretation of R̥g. V. 54.13 in JRAŞ for 1911 at page 516 which differs.

[^720]: अध्वर्युभिः पञ्चभिः सप्त विप्राः प्रियं रक्षन्ते निहितं पदं वेः। प्राची मदन्त्युक्षणो अजुर्या देवा देवानामनु हि व्रता गुः ॥ ऋ. III. 7.7. The expression सप्त विप्राः occurs frequently in the ऋ.; vide III. 31.5, IV 2.15, VI 22 2.

[^721]: आ रोदसी अपृणादोत मध्यं पञ्च देवाँ ऋतुशः सप्तसप्त। चतुस्त्रिंशता पुरुधा वि चष्टे सरुपेण ज्योतिषा विव्रतेन॥ ऋ. X. 55.3. The verse is rather enigmatic. It is in praise of Indra. The five gods are the planets that do not appear all at once but according to their respective seasons (ऋतुशः). The 34 lights are the Sun, Moon, the five planets and 27 nakṣatras, Ludwig and Oldenberg accept this interpretation. No other satisfactory explanation of 34 has been given by any one.

## Planets in Ṛgveda

Vena[^722] may be taken to be the brilliant Venus in R̥g. X.123. 1 and 5 the latter of which may be translated as follows: 'The young lady (Uṣas or lightning ), approaching with a smile her lover, bears in the highest heaven Vena, the dear one, and she moves about, in the places of the dear (Vena) and sits down with him on a golden wing (a cloud)'. This would be a fine description of Venus rising in the east at dawn.

About months a good deal would have to be said later on. The word is either 'mās' or 'māsa'. We have 'mās' in R̥g. I. 25.8, IV. 18. 4, X. 52. 3 'He (Agni) appears every day and every month' and we have 'māsa' in R̥g. III. 31.9, V.78.9 (may the boy lying in the womb of his mother for ten months come out alive &c.), X. 184. 3. 'Mās' (the measurer) also means the Moon, as in Ṛg. VIII. 94.2, X. 12,7 ( 'sūrye jyotir-adadhur-māsyaktūn,' the gods placed light in the Sun and darkness in the Moon), X. 64.3, X. 68.10, X, 92. 12, X. 93.5. The words 'mās' (moon) and 'māsa'(month ) are Indo-European, as variants of the same occur in many languages of the so-called Aryan family of languages.

Nakṣatras have been a matter of serious discussions in numerous works. The word 'nakṣatra' has in all three senses (1) star in general; (2) 27 equal parts of the zodiac; (3) asterism in the zodiacal belt ( which may each consist of one or more stars ). In my opinion the first and the 3rd are the most frequent meanings of the word in the Vedic saṁhitās. It may be that the zodiacal belt was divided into 27 equal parts called nakṣatras, but the easier, more natural and probably the earlier way was to mark some conspicuous star groups like Kṛttikās, Mṛgaśiras and to refer to them as nakṣatras. The word 'nakṣatra' occurs frequently in the Ṛgveda and the other saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas;

[^722]:  अप्सरा जारमुपसिष्मियाणा योषा बिभर्ति परमे व्योमन्। चरत्प्रियस्य योनिषु प्रियः सन्त्सीदत्पक्षे हिरण्यये स वेनः ॥ ऋ. X. 123.5. In the first verse of this hymn Vena is described as ज्योतिर्जरायुः i.e, surrounded by a sack of light as a foetus is surrounded by a sack and as pushing (towards earth) the waters that are in the bosom of the variegated one. Vena is called Randharva situated high in the heaven. Gandharva appears to have meant 'any bright heavenly body'. For example, in वाज सं. Ix. 7 'वातो वा मनो वा गन्धर्वाः सप्तविंशतिः । ते अग्रेऽश्वमयुञ्जंस्तेऽस्मिञ्जवमादधुः॥ the गन्धर्वs and the 27 (नक्षत्रs) are separately mentioned. In वाज. सं. 18.40 we have 'सुषुम्णः सूर्यरश्मिश्चन्द्रमा गन्धर्वस्तस्य नक्षत्राण्यप्सरसो भेकुरयो नाम' which is explained in शतपथ IX, 4.1.9. In अथर्व II. 2.5 the Apsarases are called 'wives of Gandharvas'. In ते सं. III. 4. 7. 1-3ff गन्धर्व is metaphorically identified with पर्जन्य, यज्ञ, मृत्यु, काम and so on and अप्सरस: are identified with दक्षिणा, विश्व, प्रजा, आधि respectively and so on. It is therefore rather difficult to say what गन्धर्व primarily meant in the early Vedic age, but when वेन is called गन्धर्व and उषस् is called अप्सरस in ऋ. x. 123.5 it would not be altogether wrong to hold that the morning star Venus is called गन्धर्व वेन and उषस् is called अप्सरस्.

"the nakṣatras like thieves go away along with nights ( to make room ) for the Sun that sees the world'[^723] (R̥g. 1. 50.2); 'May the earth, the heaven, the waters, the Sun along with the nakṣatras and the wide sky listen to us' (R̥g. III. 54. 19); 'he (Varuṇa ) urges on in two ways the big and high heaven ( the Sun) and nakṣatras and also spreads the earth' (R̥g. VII. 86.1); 'when he ( the Sun) comes up, nakṣatras are not seen in the heavens, no one knows truly (how this happens )' R̥g. X 111.7; 'The Ādityas are strong through Soma, the earth is great through Soma and then Soma is placed in the lap of these nakṣatras' ( Ṛg. X. 85.2). In some passages like R̥g. VII. 81.2 and X. 88. 13, it is difficult to say what 'nakṣatram 'stands for. Nakṣatra in most of the above passages means a star in general. But in R̥g. X. 85.2 and in X 68.11 (the pitṛs adorned the heavens with nakṣatras ) [^723a] nakṣatra appears to mean the 27 well-known asterisms. So also when the Śatapatha contrasts the Kṛttikās ( that do not swerve from the east) with other nakṣatras (that do swerve), nakṣatra should be taken to mean asterisms in the Zodiacal belt, the 27 (or 28 ) constellations in the Zodiacal belt in which the moon appears to move. Another word is ' stṛ' (that is an Indo-European word), which always occurs in the instrumental plural in the Ṛgveda (as in I. 68. 5, 1. 87. 1, I. 166. 11, II. 2. 5, II. 34. 2, IV. 7.3, VI. 49. 3 and 12 ) and is often connected with decking the sky. The word 'ṛkṣa' in the sense of 'star' occurs in R̥g. [^724] I. 24. 10 'these ṛkṣas that are established high up (in the sky ) are seen at night, but where did they go by day'. This refers to the constellation of the seven sages (Ursa Major). In the Atharvaveda VI. 40. 1, the constellation of the seven sages is expressly mentioned: "May Heaven and Earth confer on us freedom from danger here; may the Sun and the Moon do the same for us; may the wide mid regions confer on us freedom from danger and may there be _abhaya_ for us on account of the oblation offered to the Seven Sages". The Śatapatha states that the seven sages were formerly called 'ṛkṣāḥ' ( note [^727] below). In R̥g. V. 56. 3, VIII, 24, 27, VIII, 68. 15 the word _ṛkṣa_ means either 'bear' or something else.

[^723]: अप त्ये तायवो यथा नक्षत्रा यन्त्यक्तुभिः । सूराय विश्वचक्षसे ॥ ऋ. I. 50. 2.

[^723a]: Compare अभिश्यावं न कृशनेभिरश्वं नक्षत्रेभिः पितरो द्यामपिंशन् ॥ ऋ. X. 68. 11 with ऋ. I. 68.5 पिपेश नाकं स्तृभिः कृशन  appears to mean 'pearl or mother of pearl'.

[^724]: अमी ये ऋक्षा निहितास उच्चा नक्तं ददृश्रे कुहचिद् दिवेयुः ॥ ऋ. I. 24. 107 compare उच्चा दिवि दक्षिणावन्तो अस्थुर्ये अश्वदाः सह ते सूर्येण । ऋ. I. 107. 2.

## Nakṣatras in Ṛgveda

It has been pointed out above p. 494 that in R̥g. X.55.3 there is a reference to twenty-seven nakṣatras.[^725] Apart from that the Ṛgveda mentions the nakṣatras Tiṣya ( as above) and Aghā and Arjuni [^726] ( in R̥g. X. 85. 13) which two latter correspond to Maghā and Phalgunis according to the Atharvaveda. It is possible to hold either that Aghā and Maghā were names for the same nakṣatra in Ṛgvedic times or that Aghā was changed to Maghā by the time of the Tai. S. and the Atharvaveda hymns. If the latter alternative be accepted the change in the names of the two nakṣatras ( Aghā and Arjunī) could not have taken place in a short time, but would require at least a hundred years between the time of R̥g. X.85 on the one hand and Tai. S. and Atharva 19.7 on the other. This would strongly militate against Max Mūller's assignment of two hundred years to the saṁhitas which are purely hypothetical and the minimum dates ( vide Intro. p. XV to the 4th volume of his 4 volume ed. of the Ṛgveda ). Apart from Aghā and Arjuni which it is agreed are two of the 27 nakṣatras, it is probable that the Ṛgveda refers to Mṛgaśiras, Punarvasu, Śatabhiṣak and one or two more by name.

[^725]: For a myth about the disappearance of Abhijit from the list of nakṣatras, vide Vanaparva 230 2-11. There it is said tbat Abhijit, the younger sister of Rohiṇi, coveted the position of eldership and went to a forest for practising _tapas_. Skanda was approached by the wives of sages, says Mārkaṇḍeya, and he said that he would consult Brahmā. Then Brahmā arranged that time began with Dhaniṣṭhā and the Kṛttikās went to the heavens. This has been interpreted by modern writers on ancient Indian Astronomy to mean that the vernal equinox happened to be in the Kṛttikās before the time of Yudhiṣṭhira and that Abhijit was accepted as one of the nakṣatras. Vide J. of Ganganatha Jha R. I. vol. XIII at pp. 82-84 (by Prof. T. Bhattāchārya). With the greatest respect for the learned writer, I cannot accept all this. Discussion of his theory has to be given up for reasons of space.

[^726]: सूर्याया वहतुः प्रागात्सविता यमवासृजत् । अघासु हन्यन्ते गावोऽर्जुन्योः पर्युह्यते । ऋ. X. 85. 13 = अथर्व XIV. 1. 13 (सूर्याया......सृजत् । मघासु हन्यन्ते गावः फल्गुनीषु व्युह्यते।). R̥g. X. 85 is a marriage hymn, referring to the myth of the marriage of Suryā, daughter of Savitṛ, to Soma. In this verse reference is made to the sending of presents (chiefly of cows, it seems ) on A hā i.e, Maghā nakṣatra and the taking away of the bride after marriage on Arjuni (i.e. Pūrvā or Uttarā Phalguni) the next day or after one day more. The शतपथ  (II. 1. 2. 10-11 ) asserts that Phalgunyah is the recondite name of Arjuayaḥ. हन्यन्ते  in R̥g. X. 85, 13 does not mean 'are killed' but 'are beaten' or 'driven' (from the house of Şūryā's father to the house of the bridegroom). The Marathi equivalent 'हाण' means 'to beat or drive'. vide
आप. गृ. I. 3. 1-2 'मघाभिर्गावो गृह्यन्ते । फल्गुनीभ्यां न्यूह्यते ।; रोहिणी मृगशीर्षमुत्तरे फल्गुनी स्वातीति विवाहस्य नक्षत्राणि । बो. गृ. I. 1. 20.

The Nakṣatras are 27 or 28 (adding Abhijit after Uttarāsādhā and before Śravaṇa in ancient authorities ). In the Vedic literature, Vedāṅgajyotiṣa and even in Yājñavalkya-smṛti they are enumerated from Kṛttikā to Apabharaṇi ( or bharaṇi ) while in works from the 3rd or 4th century A. D. and in modern times they are enumerated from Aśvini to Revati.

It is time now to set out in a list the names of nakṣatras, deities governing them, their gender and the number of stars in each. There is some divergence of views as regards the names and the deities, which will also be pointed out in the appended table: complete lists occur in Tai. S. IV. 4.10. 1-3, Tai. Br. I. 5 and III. 1, Atharvaveda XIX. 7. 2-5, Kāṭhaka saṁhita 39.13, Maitrāyaṇi saṁhitā II. 13,20 and Vedāṅga-jyotiṣa. For European equivalents of the Indian nakṣatras, vide Colebrooke in Asiatic Researches vol. IX chart opposite p. 322, Dikshit's Marathi work (2nd ed. p. 459 ) and Burgess in J. R. A. S. for 1893 p. 756. It is not unlikely that there is a veiled reference to Revati, Punarvasū and Puṣya nakṣatras in Ṛg. X. 119. 1-3[^728], and R̥g. X. 86.22 appears to refer [^729], as Tilak says in 'Orion' p.166 ff., to the Mṛgaśiras nakṣatra; ‘Vṛṣākapi! O Indra! when you dashing upwards came to the house, where was that Mṛga guilty of a good deal of sin, to whom did that Mṛga, that confounds people, go? Indra is superior to all'. From R̥g. I. 161.11 and 13 and IV, 33.7, Atharvaveda IV. 11.11 it appears that the dog-star (Sirius ) is referred to, and that twelve days were added at the end of the year during which the Ṛbhus slept or took rest or enjoyed the hospitality of the Sun.[^730]

[^727]: अभयं द्यावापृथिवी इहास्तु नोऽभयं सोमः सविता नः कृणोतु । अभयं नोऽस्तूर्वन्तरिक्षं सप्तऋषीणां च हविषाभयं नोऽस्तु ॥ अथर्ववेद VI. 40.1. ; ऋक्षाणां ह वा एता अग्रे पत्न्य आसुः सप्तर्षीन्नु ह स्म वै पुरर्क्षा इत्याचक्षते । शतपथ II. 1. 2. 4. एताः refers to कृतिकाs.

[^728]: निवर्तध्वं मानु गातास्मान्सिषक्त रेवतीः । अग्नीषोमा पुनर्वसू अस्मे धारयतं रयिम् । पुनरेता नि वर्तन्तामस्मिन् पुष्यन्तु गोपतौ । इहैवाग्ने नि धारयेह तिष्ठतु या रयिः ॥ ऋ. x. 19.1 and 3 (addressed to cows or rain waters). Both Grassmann and Geldner hold that पुनर्वसू refers to the constellation so called.

[^729]: यदुदञ्चो वृषाकपे गृहमिंद्राजगन्तन । क्वस्य पुल्वघो मृगः कमगञ्जनयोपनो विश्वस्मादिन्द्र उत्तरः॥ ऋग्वेद  X. 86. 22. It has to be supposed that this is addressed by some one else (Indrāni probably). निरुक्त XIII. 3, explains this verse. Prajāpati guilty of the sin of incest is said to have jumped up as a deer in the sky pursued by Rudra. Vide ऐ. ब्रा. XIII, 10 "स विद्ध ऊर्ध्व उदप्रपतत्तमेतं मृग इत्याचक्षते य उ एव मृगव्याधः स उ एव सः । या रोहित्सा रोहिणी ।"

[^730]: सुषुप्वांस ऋभवस्तदपृच्छतागोह्य क इदं नो अबूबुधत् । श्वानं बस्तो बोधयितारमब्रवीत्संवत्सर इदमद्या व्यख्यत ॥ ऋ. I. 161. 13; द्वादश द्यून् यदगोह्यस्यातिथ्ये रणन्नूभवः ससन्तः । ऋ.IV. 33, 7. The first may be translated as follows: O Ṛbhus! after having slept you asked this 'O Agohya (the Sun who cannot be concealed by any one)! who is here that awakened us? The goat (the Sun) replied that the dog was the awakener at the end of year and that this was announced that day.' Tilak in 'Orion' (pp. 168 ff) explains at great length the meaning of these verses. Though one may not agree with every thing that he says, his main contentions seem to be probable.

## Nakṣatras in Ṛgveda

In R̥g. I. 124.9 'satam torājan bhiṣajaḥ sahasram' it is possible to see a reference to the Śatabhiṣak nakṣatra of which Varuṇa is said be the devatā in the Tai. Br. III. 1, especially as in the following verse (ami ya ṛkṣā nihitāsa uccā ) there is a special reference to the Great Bear or to nakṣatras in general.

Some remarks on the nakṣatras in general and on individual nakṣatras would not be out of place. In the Ātharvaṇa nakṣatrakalpa (the first of the Atharvapariśiṣṭas edited by Bolling and Negelein ) in chapter 4 verses 1-8 the devatās (deities) of the nakṣatras are given and chap. 2 states the number of stars in each nakșatra. In some Purāṇas also such as the Viṣṇudharmottara (J. 83. 13-21) the presiding deities of nakṣatras are set out. In the Bṛhat-saṁhitā Varāhamihira (chap. 97. 4-5) specifies the deities of the nakṣatras from Aśvini to Revati (including Abhijit ) as noted below. The Bṛhat-saṁhitā (96. 1-3), the Ātharvaṇa-nakṣatra-kalpa (1, 2) and the Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 88 4-7) specify the number of single stars in each nakṣatra (which are from one to six ), those having six stars being Kṛttikā, Āśleṣā and Maghā. Vide JASB, vol. 62 part 1 p. 14 where Hoernle gives a table, from a ms, of Puṣkarasāri's work, of nakṣatras, the stars in each, the _muhūrtas_, the _gotra_, _devata_ of each. According to Hoernle the work is very old. Some notes are added on individual nakṣatras ( mentioned in the Vedic works ). Kṛttika-The Tai, Br, III. 1.4. 1 specifies the names of seven Kr̥ttikās as Ambā, Dulā &c. Pāṇini refers to Kr̥ittikā as Bahulā (in IV. 3. 34). J. C. Hickey in 'Introducing the universe' (pp. 119 120) says that persons of unusually keen [^731] vision under favourable atmospheric conditions can see even eleven. Mṛgaśirṣa-Tai. Br. III. 1. 4. 3 mentions both names viz, Mṛgaśirṣa and Invakā. Punarvasū—In the Kāṭhaka and Mai. S. this is masculine singular ; Pāṇini states (1. 2. 61 ) that in the Veda the word 'Punarvasu' is employed optionally in the singular (i.e. sometimes in the dual, sometimes in the singular).

[^731]: मृगशीर्षमिति नक्षत्रमूर्तिसमूहनाम । इन्वका इति मूर्तिविशेषाणां नाम । सायण on तै. प्रा. III.1.4.3; छन्दसि पुनर्वस्वोरेकवचनम्। पा. I.2.61. The काशिका has 'पुनर्वसुर्नक्षत्रमदितिर्देवता। पुनर्वसू नक्षत्रमदितिर्देवता।.' पुष्यसिध्यौ नक्षत्रे। पा. III.1.116. The काशिका explains पुष्यन्त्यस्मिन्नर्था इति पुष्यः । सिध्यन्त्यस्मिन्निति सिध्यः । फल्गुनीप्रोष्ठपदानां च नक्षत्रे । पा. I. 2. 60; काशिका explains कदा पूर्वफल्गुग्यौ कदा पूर्वाः फल्गुन्यः कदा पूर्वे प्रोष्ठपदेकदा पूर्वा प्रोष्ठपदाः ।. आश्वि-यम-दहन-कमलज-शशि-शूलभृद्-अदिति-जीव-फणि-पितरः। योनि-अर्यमदिनकृत्-त्वष्ट-पवन-शक्रोग्नि-मित्राश्च ॥ शक्रो निर्ऋतिस्तोयं विश्वे ब्रह्मा हरिर्वसुर्वरुणः । अजपादोऽहिर्बुध्न्यः पूषा चेतीश्वरा भानाम् ॥ बृहत्सं. 97.4-5. योनि stands for भग the presiding deity of पूर्वाफल्गुनी (in the वेदाङ्गज्योतिष and आथर्वणनक्षत्रकल्प I. 4). The आथर्वणनक्षत्रकल्प differs from बृहत्सं. as to some of the regents of नक्षत्र.

Kālidāsa employs the dual Punarvasū ja Raghuvaṁśa XI. 36 'gām gatāviva divaḥ Punarvasū.'

Tiṣya-Pāniṇi uses the word Tiṣya in I. 2. 63 and 3. 34 and the words Puṣya and Sidhya in the sense of 'on which undertakings prosper or succeed.'

Phalguni-Pāṇini provides that the words Phalguni and Proṣthapadā as nakṣatras are optionally used in the dual or plural.

Niṣṭyā---Mai. S. shows that this is neuter singular. Niṣṭyā in R̥g. VI, 75. 19, VIII, 1, 13, X 133.5 appears to mean 'outsider or outcaste'.

Viśākhā-Pāniṇi (I. 2. 62) provides that in the Veda 'Viśakhā' is sometimes used in the singular, sometimes in the dual, while in his day it was used in the dual.

Anurādhā-The mantra in Tai. Br. III. 1,2, 1 appears to use it as masculine plural.

Rohiṇi-Jyeṣṭhā is called Rohiṇi in Tai. S. and Tai, Br, (1,5). Jyeṣṭhā is styled Jyeṣṭhāghni in Atharva VI. 110. 2. Vide note [^753] below.

Mūla-In Tai, S, Vicr̥tau is used for Mūla, The Atharvaveda brings together Vicr̥tau and Jyeṣṭhāghni in VI. 110. 2-3 and has "Vicr̥tau nāma tārake' in II. 8, 1 and VI. 121. 3. In R̥g. X, 87, 10 (tridhā mūlam yātudhānasya vr̥śca ) Mūla means 'root, foot'. The word 'Mūlabarhaṇa' occurs in Atharva VI, 110.2 and Mūlabarhaṇi in Tai. Br. I. 5. 1. 4.

Abhijit--not mentioned in Tai, S. and Kāṭhaka, though mentioned in Tai, Br., Atharva and Mai. S. It is sometimes mentioned in later works e. g, the Anuśāsanaparva ( 64. 5–35 ) mentions the consequences of gifts to brāhmaṇas on 28 nakṣatras from Kr̥ttikā to bharaṇi.

Śronā-Atharva calls it Śravaṇa and Kāṭhaka speaks of it as Aśvattha. In Pāṇini IV. 2. 22 Aśvattha is mentioned as a nakṣatra, The word Śroṇa in R̥g. I, 112. 8 means 'lame or cripple'.

Proṣṭhapadā --Atharvaveda speaks of 'dvayā Proṣṭhapadā'.

It would be noticed that some of the names of nakṣatras differ such as Invakā (in Tai. Br. 1.5.1 and Kāṭhaka ) for Mṛga śīrṣa, Bāhū for Ārdrā ( in Tai. Br. I. 5.1, Kāṭhaka S. and Maitrā. yani S.), Tiṣya for Puṣya, Niṣṭyā for Svāti (in Tai. Br.), Rohiṇi ( in Tai. Br. I. 5.4 and Tai. S.) for Jyeṣṭhā, Vicr̥tau in Tai. S. for Mūla ( in other Vedic texts ), Śroṇā (in Tai. S., Tai. Br. and Mai. S.) and Aśvattha in Kāṭhaka S. for Śravaṇa (in Atharva. ), Śraviṣṭhā for (medieval and modern ) Dhaniṣṭhā, Apabharaṇi for bharaṇi (in Atharva., Mai. S. and modern times). The deities also differ, the most striking being the change of place between Bhaga and Aryaman as presiding deities of Āṣāḍhās in the Kāṭhaka, Vedāṅgajyotiṣa, Śan gr̥. and Indra as deity of Citrā in Tai. S. and Tyaṣṭr̥ in Tai. Br.

Nakṣatras in saṁhitās and Brāhmaṇas

and Kāṭhaka S., Pitaraḥ as deity for Mūla in Tai. S. but Nirr̥ti in almost all other texts; Indra as deity of Śatabhisak in Tai. S. and Maj. S. but Varuṇa in Tai. Br. (III. 1.) and Kāṭhaka. Further, it was also specified whether a nakṣatra had only one star or had a cluster of two or three or more. Besides, the important point for consideration is; why does the Tai. S. differ from the Tai. Br. and Tai. Br. I. 5 from Tai. Br. III, 1 in the number of nakṣatras, in the names and the deities also of some of them. No satisfactory explanation can be given except this that the Tai. S. passage is earlier by some centuries than the Tai. Br. section (III. 1) or the Tai. S was composed in a country far away from the place where the Tai. Br. was composed. This latter does not appear to be probable since one part of Tai. Br. (1. 5) differs from another part (III. 1). The latter section speaks of a nakṣatra-iṣṭi in which oblations are offered to 28 nakṣatras ( including Abhijit ) and their deities (one nakṣatra being dealt with on each day from Kṛttikās) together with _puronuvākyās_ ( invitatory verses ) and _yājyās_ (oblation verses ) which are different for each nakṣatra. The first fourteen nakṣatras from Kṛttikā (up to and including Viśākhā) are called Devanakṣatras and the fourteen nakṣatras from Anūrādhā to Apabharaṇi or bharaṇi are cālled Yamanakṣatras. After Viśākhā, the Tai. Br. (Nakṣatreṣṭi) inserts Paurṇamāsi with appropriate puronuvākyā and yājyā verses and after apabharaṇi an offering to Amāvāsyā with a puronuvākyā (which is the verse 'Nivesani saṅgamani vasūnām' Tai. S. III. 5.1.1) and a yājyā ( which is the verse "yat te devā adadhur', Tai. S. III. 4. 1. 1). Besides, it was laid down that the sacrificer had to invoke gods in the sacrifice by a name ( to be kept secret) derived from the presiding deity of the nakṣatra on which he was [^732] born ( i.e. if born on Kṛttikā, then some name like Agnimitra &c., if on Puṣya, Bṛhaspatimitra &c.).

[^732]: नक्षत्रदेवता ह्येता एताभिर्यज्ञकर्मणि । यजमानस्य शास्त्रज्ञैर्नाम नक्षत्रजं स्मृतम् ॥ वेदाङ्गज्योतिष verse 28.  Western scholars usually ascribe the Vedāṅga jyotiṣa to about 400 B. C. For example, 'L' Inde classique' edited by Prof. L. Renou and others, Tome II. para 1711 assigos, after saying that the date is undetermined, 400 B, C as its probable date. I should like to place it not later than 8th century B.C. for several reasons. If the observation referred to above (p.496) about Kṛttikās were made about 12th century B.C. (14th century B.C. as some scholars hold) and if 400 or 300 B.C, was accepted as the date of the Vedāṅgajyotiṣa, it would have to be supposed that the writer of it either did not notice (or purposely ignored ) the fact that winter solstice had shifted about 11 or 12 degrees from the originally observed position. This is rather difficult to believe. A difference of four or five degrees may not be dwelt upon. Besides, the facts that the Baudhāyana-śrauta-sūtra has a similar passage, that Kauṭilya follows the five year cycle and says that there is an intercalary month at the end of 27 years and another intercalary month at the end of the cycle of five years (11.2 on p. 109 ) and the fact that the Mahābhārata (Virāṭaparva 52.3-5) speaks of adding two intercalary months every five years rather suggest an earlier date for the Vedāṅga-jyotiṣa. Vide Swamikannu Pillai's 'Indian Ephemeris' vol. I part I. p. 448 ff for discussion on the probability of the antiquity of the वेदाङ्गज्योतिष.

## Nakṣatras and Agnyādheya

If the nakṣatras ( 27 or 28 ) had been borrowed at one time _en bloc_ from a foreign source the divergences in the names of the nakṣatras, in the presiding deities, and in the gender and number should ordinarily not have arisen to the extent they do. But, if they were an indigenous growth then differences of opinion would naturally have been evolved in the passage of centuries. The only asterisms first specialised and named in Greece and Syria were the Pleiades in Job. 38. 31, Homer and Hesiod; Orion in Job. 39.31, Homer and Hesiod; Arcturus in Job. 9.9 and in 39.32, Homer and Hesiod; the great Bear in Homer and Hesiod, Aldebaran in Homer and Hesiod and three more including Sirius (vide 'Dawn of Astronomy' by Norman Lockyer, 1884 p. 33). This is several centuries later (if not thousands) than the early Vedic texts wherein the whole scheme of nakṣatras appears.

Further details contained in the Tai. Br. and Baudhāyana śrauta-sūtra ( 28, 3–4 ) are not set out here. The Nakṣatreṣṭi in the Tai. Br. (III. 1 ) has been competently dealt with by Prof. Paul Emile Dumont in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. 98, No. 3 ( 1954 ) with text, English translation and notes. The nakṣatras had been closely observed and many legends arose from imaginary resemblances of star groups to certain familiar animals and also fanciful interpretations of the constellations observed in the sky. The nakṣatras were closely concerned not merely in a religious rite called Nakṣatreṣṭi, but they were of prime importance in the basic śrauta rite, viz. consecration of the sacred fires (Agnyādhāna). In the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (II. 1. 2 ) reference is made to several nakṣatras from Kṛttikā onwards together with their presiding deities as being fit for Agnyadhāna (viz. Kṛttikā, Rohiṇi, Mṛgaśīrsa, Pūrvā Phalguni, Uttarā Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā). The Tai. Br. recommends spring, summer and Śarad for Agnyādheya in the case of Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya or vaiśya sacrificer respectively. The Śatapatha appears to condemn setting up of sacred fires in relation to nakṣatra alone and recommends that Agnyādheya should be performed on the New Moon of Vaiśākha on which there is Rohiṇi nakṣatra ;[^732a] but these rules did not apply when a person had resolved upon performing Soma sacrifice and he should not in that case stop to consider the season or nakṣatra.

Very interesting information and legends are given in the Vedic texts about some of the nakṣatras. About the Kṛttikās the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa[^733] states 'other nakṣatras contain one star, or two or three or four stars, but these Kṛttikās are many; the sacrificer reaches plenty; therefore one should set up sacred fires on the Kṛttikās. These ( Kṛttikās) indeed do not swerve from the east, while all other nakṣatras do swerve from the eastern direction.' The recondite allusion in R̥g. I. 164, 33 (atra pitā duhitur-garbham-ādhāt) and X. 61.7 (pitā yat svām duhitaramadhiṣkan) are developed into a myth, a lengthy account of which is given in the Ait. Br. XIII. 10 and Śatapatha I. 6. 2. 1-4 (Prajāpati approached his daughter, some say the heaven and others say it was Uṣas &c.) and about Rohiṇi, Mṛga, the Mṛgavyādha (Sirius) and the three stars in the belt of Orion. Prajāpati [^734] is said to have had 33 daughters which he gave in marriage to king Soma, who was fond of Rohiṇi and on account of that suffered from Rājayakṣman (Tai. S. II. 3. 5. 1).

[^732a]: तस्मान्न नक्षत्र आदधीत । ...योसौ वैशाखस्यामावास्या तस्यामादधीत सा रोहिण्या सम्पद्यते। आत्मा वै प्रजा पशवो रोहिणी। ...शतपथ XI. 1.1.3 and 7.

[^733]: एकं द्वे त्रीणि चत्वारीति वा अन्यानि नक्षत्राण्यथैता एव भूयिष्ठा या कृत्तिकास्तद्भूमानमेवैतदुपैति । तस्मात्कृत्तिकास्वादधीत । एता ह वै प्राच्यै दिशो न च्यवन्ते सर्वाणि हवा अन्यानि नक्षत्राणि प्राच्यै दिशश्च्यवन्ते । शतपथ II. 1. 2. 2-3. It should be noted that the present tense ( _cyavante_ ) is used here, whence it follows that this passage was composed when the position of the Kṛttikās on the equator was an observed fact and their declination was nil. From this S. B. Dikshit deduced the date 3000 B. C (I. A, volume 24 pages 245-257). The कृत्तिकाs are said to be seven in Maitrāyani S I. 6.9 and Tai, Br. Il 1 4. 1.

[^734]: प्रजापतेस्त्रयस्त्रिंशद् दुहितर आसन् । ताः सोमाय राज्ञेऽदवात् । तासां रोहिणीसुपैत् । तैे. सं. II. 3. 5.1; प्रजापतिर्वै सोमाय राज्ञे दहितॄरददान्नक्षत्राणि स रोहिण्यामेवावसत्। काठकसं. XI. 3. The number 33 is arrived at by adding 7 कृत्तिकाs and the remaining 26 नक्षत्रs.

Why the nakṣatra lists begin with the Kṛttikās in the Vedic Literature and why with Aśvini in classical Sanskrit literature can be explained only on astronomical considerations. The vernal equinox was in Kṛttikā about 2300 B. C. Instead of admitting this as a probable date for the Vedic works, Fleet boldly asserts that the list of nakṣatras beginning with Kṛttikās has no basis in fact, but belongs entirely to ritual and astrology (JRAS for 1916 p. 570 ). No detailed arguments are deemed necessary. Fleet does not specify cogent evidence, nor does he assign reasons why priests later on changed the beginning of the list from Kṛttikā to Aśvini, nor does he vouchsafe how the list of nakṣatras in the Vedic age began in fact for ordinary folk if the Kṛttikā list was a pure priestly invention. Even Thibaut (in I. A. vol. 24 at p. 100 ) had to admit that the beginning of the nakṣatra series with Kṛttikā instead of with Aśvini seriously affects Max Muller's assignment of 1500 B. C. to 800 B. C. to the Vedic period. In the Tai. S. VII. 4. 8 there is a discussion about the time for undergoing the dīkṣā in a Sāṁvatsara-satra'. [^735] It is proposed there that the dikṣā may be performed on the Full Moon in Phalgunī because that is the beginning of the year; then an objection is raised against this and it is proposed that the dikṣā may be taken on Full Moon in Citrā, because that was the beginning of the year. If the year began with the winter solstice in those days this reference would have to be placed at 4000 or 6000 B. C. This passage probably embodies traditions that the year began in different months in different periods of antiquity.

Great controversies have raged over the question whether the Indian nakṣatras are indigenous or were borrowed from some other people. The great French astronomer Biot held that Indians borrowed the nakṣatra system from the Chinese and Whitney followed Biot. There were others who held that Indians borrowed them either from the Babylonians or the Arabs. I cannot enter here into the merits of these discussions. The Arabs themselves admit that they borrowed their astronomy from Indian Siddhāntas and there is hardly anything to show that they know the complete nakṣatra system as early as at least 1500 B. C. Therefore, we may leave the Arabs out of account altogether ( vide Thibaut in Grundriss p. 14). Great scholars are often blinded by prejudices and shut their eyes to basic facts. The Chinese system of Sieu had at first only 24 and then it became one of ( it is said ) 28 at about 1100 B. C. ( as said by Thibaut in Grundriss p. 13.) There are no clear traces in the Vedic texts that nakṣatras were held to be 24 during the times of those texts.

## Nakṣatras indigenous or borrowed

We should not accept at their face value the assumptions of the antiquity of astronomy in China that are sometimes advanced (vide' East and West', Rome, vol. VI. p. 288.) Besides, neither in Babylonia nor in China were the asterisms thoroughly integrated with the religious system. In Vedic times one was not entitled to perform solemn sacrifices unless he had already set up sacred fires on certain nakṣatras. Further, the months (Māgha, Phālguna, Caitra &c.) were named after certain nakṣatras and exist only in Sanskrit, not in Greek, Latin or Chinese. The deities that were deemed to preside over the nakṣatras from such ancient days as those of the Tai. S. and Tai. Br. are almost all of them exclusively Vedic and have no counterparts in Babylonia or China. Besides, though thousands of cuneiform tablets have been found in Babylonia no one has, so far as I know, pointed to a single tablet where all the nakṣatras appear in an orderly series of 27 or 23, as we find in Vedic saṁhitās. It is at least clear that long before the Taittiriya saṁhitā the Vedic people had fixed the number of the nakṣatras (at 27 or 28 ), their names and order and their presiding deities and had made the nakṣatras a most integral part of their sacrificial system. Furthermore, almost all of the Indian names of nakṣatras are significant or have ancient legends connected with them. For example, Ārdrā means 'wet' and the nakṣatra was called Ārdrā because when the sun was in it rains set in. Punarvasu was probably so called because the grains of paddy or barley sown in the ground sprout up as new wealth after being buried; Puṣya, was so called because the young sprouts grow and become nourished; Āśreṣā or Āśleśā, because the grown-up plants of paddy or barley grow high enough to embrace each other; Maghā, because the paddy or other plants are putting forth the standing crop which is wealth in itself; Kṛttiki, because they (being six or seven ), look like the skin of the spotted deer on which a religious student was to sit for Vedic study. In these circumstances the burden to prove borrowing of the nakṣatra system by Indians was very heavy on those who affirmed it. What is the evidence? There is very little evidence except prejudice and speculation. The main tangible evidence they can and do rely on is that the Chinese or Babylonians had also 28 nakṣatras as the Indians had. But these scholars, though very learned and far seeing in their own way, never stopped to consider how from China and Babylon the nakṣatras could reasonably be supposed to have been derived by Indians more than 3500 years ago (on a most modest estimate) and allowed to be the very centre and basis of their religion of sacrifices, what were the means for the communication of the thoughts and ideas underlying the nakṣatra system and why one may not surmise that the real state of things was the other way about (viz. the Babylonians and Chinese derived the system from the ancestors of Indians ) or that all systems were derived from a common prehistoric source. Another reason for discounting the theories of Biot, Weber and Whitney may also be advanced viz. the researches of Tilak in his 'Orion' (particularly pp. 61-95) and of Prof. Jacobi have at least made this clear that the Kṛttikā series is not the oldest arrangement of the nakṣatras known to Indians, but that the Indians had once an older arrangement, which placed Mṛgaśirṣa at the vernal equinox. Those who are interested in these somewhat novel and rather barren controversies raised by Biot, Weber and others may read Weber's 'der vedischen Nachrichten von den Nakṣatras', two volumes, I. A. vol. 23 pp. 154-159 (Jacobi on the date of the Ṛgveda'), pp. 238–249 (Būhler's note on Jacobi's theory and Tilak's Orion, 1. A. pp. 85-100 (Thibaut on ‘antiquity of Vedic civilization') and pp. 361-369 (Whitney), I. A. 48 pp. 95–97. The word 'nakṣatra' is derived by Yāska [^736] from the root 'nakṣ' meaning 'to go', while the Śatapatha Br. (II. 1. 2. 17-18) and Tai. Br. II. 7. 18 derive it as from _na_ plus _kṣatra_ and Pāniṇi (VI. 3.75) accepts this derivation. The word 'nakṣatra'(m) is applied even to the Sun in R̥g. VI. 67. 6. Tai. Br. teaches how one is to mark the nakṣatra on which one has to perform a religious act, viz. he should mark about dawn and before the first rays light the sky the part of the sky where the nakṣatra appears and when the sun appears the nakṣatra would be to the west of the sun, at which time he should perform what he has to do. It is stated that sage Matsya established into eminence Yajñeṣu and Śatadyumna by this method (Tai, Br. I. 5. 2.1.).

Even so early as the Ait. Br. [^737] Vedic Indians had arrived at the conclusion that the Sun was one and never sets. "This Sun indeed never sets nor rises. When people think that he (the Sun) sets what happens is he reaches the end of the day, reverses himself, creates night below and day above. When people think that he rises in the morning, that means that having reached the end of the night he reverses himself, makes day below and night above. He indeed never sets'. This is in very interesting contrast to the Jaina view in Sūryaprajñapti of two suns and two moons or the view of Heraclitus in Greece ( 6th century B. C.) that a new sun was born and died every day ( Eisler p. 42.)

[^736]:  ऋक्षाः स्तृभिः-इति नक्षत्राणाम्। नक्षत्राणि नक्षतेर्गतिकर्मणः। नेमानि क्षत्राणिइति च ब्राह्मणम् । निरुक्त III. 20. The first derivation is supported by तै. ब्रा. I. 5.2.10 'यो वा इह यजते अमुं लोकं नक्षते तन्नक्षत्राणां नक्षत्रत्वम्'।.

[^737]: स वा एष न कदाचनास्तमेति नोदेति। तं यदस्तमेतीति मन्यन्तेऽह्न एव तदन्त मित्वाथात्मानं विपर्यस्यते रात्रीमेवाधस्तात्कुरुतेऽहः परस्तात् । अथ यदेनं प्रातरुदेतीति मन्यन्ते रात्रेरेव तदन्तमित्वाऽथात्मानं विपर्यस्यतेऽहरेवावस्तात्कुरुते रात्रिं परस्तात् । स वा एष न कदाचन निम्लोचति । ऐ. बा. III, 44. This idea is taken up by soma Furanas also. For example, विष्णुपुराण II. 8.15 says नैवास्तमनमर्कस्य नोदयः सर्वदा सतः । उदयास्तमनाख्यं हि दर्शनादर्शनं रवेः। ब्रह्मगुप्त in ब्राह्मस्फुटसि. XI. 3 criticises the Jain view "भानि चतुःपञ्चाशद्द्वार्वेकन्दवौ जिनोक्तं यत् । ध्रुवमत्स्यस्यावर्तो भवति यतोह्ना ततस्तदसत्॥". The पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका (XIII. 8) also refers to this Jaina view.


## The Sun and Ait. Br.

In the Brāhmaṇa period Indians had [^737a] found out the day called Viṣuvat or Viṣuva (which is said to be in the middle of the sacrificial year) when the day and night were of equal length: 'As a person fastens the two wings or sloping sides of a hall (or shed) to the bamboo ridge or beam that is in the middle of the shed ), so people use the Divākīrtya day for stretching across the two sides ( half years)'.

I have purposely devoted some space to the subject of the astronomical knowledge of people in the Vedic age. Several European scholars that have written on the astronomical achievements of ancient and medieval India, have indulged in very disparaging and contemptuous statements about Indians not only in astronomy, but generally.

[^737a]: एकविंशमेतदहरुपयन्ति विषुवन्तं मध्ये संवत्सरस्य । ऐ.ब्रा. IV. 18 (18.4); यथा शालायै पक्षसी मध्यमं वंशमभिसमायच्छति एवं, संवत्सरस्य पक्षसी दिवाकीर्त्यमभिसंतन्वन्ति नार्निमार्च्छन्ति । तै.ब्रा.I. 2. 3. सायण explains on ऐ.ब्रा.'दिवैव कीर्तनीयं मन्त्रजातं यस्मिन्विषुवत्यहनि तदहर्दिवाकीर्त्यम् ।'.The ताण्ड्यब्राह्मण (IV, 6. 3-13 and IV. 7. 1) refers to विषुवत् day and provides that दिवाकीर्त्यसाम is to be sung that day since the Gods removed by Divākirtya the darkness with which Svarbhānu, the son of an Asura, had pierced the sun and that विषुवत् is the soul of the year and two wings or two sides go round it. Vide H. of Dh vol. II. page 1240 for the arrangement of the 'Gavām-ayana', a Saṁvatasarika sattra and the position of the विषुवत् day It should not be forgotten that the Equinox itself is more or less an astronomical fiction and cannot be accurately observed without scientific apparatus. As the sacrificial year had only 360 days and a day called विषुवत् was in the middle that would come to 361 days while the solar year is 365 1/4 days nearly and therefore विषुवत् would have been a day of equal day and night only approximately.

To take only one or two instances. Thibaut (Grundriss p. 3 ) is pleased to observe that what Indians knew before Greek influence is not much and is of a primitive character. This is how Whitney, a learned American scholar of Sanskrit, unburdens himself; 'there can be no question that, from what we know in other respects of the character and tendencies of the Hindu mind, we should not at all look to find the Hindus in possession of an astronomical science possessing so much of truth. They have been from the beginning distinguished by a remarkable inaptitude and disinclination to observe, to collect facts, to record, to make inductive investigations' (J. A. O. S. vol. VI p 471). His coadjutor, Mr. Burgess, differed from him even in regard to astronomy (ibid. pp. 477–480 ).

One is tempted to return Whitney's compliments to Indians in the same coin by saying that for 1400 years from Ptolemy, the ancestors of Whitney and other highbrows hardly ever made any discovery of astronomical importance, stuck unthinkingly and slavishly to the Almagest and were literally in the dark about the true astronomical position during what are often called the Dark Ages of Europe. Even Luther who rebelled against the authority of the Pope denounced Copernicus as a fool, charged the latter with turning upside down the science of astronomy and relied upon the Bible, which, he said, declared that Joshua commanded the Sun to stand still and not the Earth (Joshua 10. 12). This betrays the old mentality that if there is a contradiction between the words of the Bible and Nature, the believers in Scripture must correct their ideas of Nature in accordance with the Bible and not the Bible in accordance with what is found to be Nature. This also reminds one of the maxim of the Pūrvamimāṁsā that there is nothing too heavy for a sacred text.

I should request all Western authors interested in Indology and dazzled by some writings of a few Greeks to ponder deeply over the following words of Sir Norman Lockyer in his 'Dawn of Astronomy' (1894) 'Anaximander told us that the earth was cylindrical in shape and every place that was then known was situated on the flat end of the cylinder; and Plato, on the ground that the cube was the most perfect geometrical figure, imagined the earth to be a cube, the part of the earth known to the Greeks being on the upper surface. In these matters the vaunted Greek mind was little in advance of the predecessors of the Vedic priests' (p. 8).

## Unpardonable omissions by Western writers

If the Greeks forged ahead in one or two branches, there were several other peoples in the world that far surpassed them in other equally important matters. I would also recommend to them to read carefully what Sarton says in his Preface (p. IX) to 'A history of Science' where he charges Western writers with unpardonable omissions viz. ignoring the scientific efforts of Egypt, Mesopotamia and other countries and assuming childishly that science began in Greece and secondly hiding the superstitions which surrounded eminent Greeks. Writers at least in the 19th and 20th centuries should have no reason to run down one people and praise to the skies another people, but their endeavour should be to arrive at well documented, well-balanced, impartial and cautious judgments upon the achievements of ancient peoples of the world.

The chronology of the Vedic age is far from certain. Jacobi, Dikshit, Tilak and some others would put the Vedic age back to 4000 B. C. or even earlier. Winternitz puts it as far back as 2500 B. C.; while Max Mūller and following him many Western scholars would thrust all Vedic Literature between 1500 to 800 B.C. Even taking these latter timings the Vedic Literature shows a good deal of progress in astronomical matters which Indians could not have owed to Greece. There is no extant literature in Greece that can be placed earlier than about 900 or 800 B. C. with certainty. The Homeric poems and the works of Hesiod are the oldest surviving literary writings in Greek. Homer mentions the Sun, the Moon, the morning and evening star, the Pleiades, Hyades, Orion, Great Bear, Sirius (Orion's Dog), Bootes (Arcturus) and Hesiod mentions practically the same stars as Homer; Hesiod says that spring began sixty days after winter solstice, puts down moon's period at thirty days, but does not mention equinoxes.[^738] It should be noted that Vedic astronomy several centuries (if not thousands of years) earlier than Homer and Hesiod was at least as advanced as that in the two Greek authors. The very ancient peoples (besides Indians and Chinese ) are the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Hittites and Chaldeans. About the Egyptians, the Cambridge Ancient History (vol. II p. 218) states that there is very little trace of the application of Mathematics to Astronomy in Egypt and that, though the length of the solar year had been fairly accurately determined, this was done by observation of the heliacal rising of Sirius or Sothis which happened to correspond rather closely with the first rise of the Nile and involved no calculation whatsoever.

[^738]: Vide 'Greek Astronomy' by T. L. Heath (1932) introduction XI-XII and Sir Norman Lockyer's 'Dawn of Astronomy' (1894) p. 133 for the knowledge of only a few stars exhibited in the Book of Job and by Homer and Hesiod.

About Hittites and Chaldeans there is not much to be said as no one asserts that nakṣatras were borrowed from them. Even about 800 B.C. Homer's and Hesiod's knowledge of astronomy was meagre. Even Hipparchus, regarded as the greatest astronomer of antiquity who completed his catalogue about 130 B. C., had access to a continuous series of observations made in Mesopotamia reaching back to 747 B. C.[^738a] Ptolemy wrote about 150 A. D.; his Almagest is based on the observations of Hipparchus, and almost all that is known about the predecessors of Ptolemy is derived from the latter's work, as, owing to the very excellence of Ptolemy's work, all writings of his predecessors ceased to be studied and have not been recovered. The theory of Greek influence in astrology will be dealt with a little later on, but a few words may be said here about the supposed influence of Greek astronomy on the Indian Siddhāntas[^[^739]] and later works.

[^738a]: Vide Rawlinson in 'Five monarchies of the Ancient World,' vol. II. p. 574; also Breasted in 'Ancient Times' p. 214 for the passing of the observations of Nabunassar and Kidinnu (who practically discovered the Precession of the Equinoxes) to the Greeks and for the Greek engineer Meton taking the length of the year from the tables of Nabu. A continuous record of dated observations began with the reign of Nabunassar ( who began to rule in 747 B. C.), from which date the observations continued till Ptolemy's day; vide Heath's 'Greek Astronomy' p. XIV and pp. 142–143. Prof. Neugebauer has recently questioned the claims of Babylonian Kidinnu to have discovered the precession of the equinoxes (in JAOS for 1950. vol. 70 pp. 1-8) and Morris Jastrow (Jr.) in 'Hepatoscopy and Astrology' contributed to Proceedings of American Philosophical Society vol. XLVII at p. 671 appears to have done the same before him, Sarton ( in JAOS vol, 75 No. 3 p. 169 ) supports Prof. Neugebauer, though he admits that some of the Babylonian observations made it easier for Hipparchus to discover precession of equinoxes.

[^739]: पौलिशरोमकवासिष्ठसौरपैतामहास्तु सिद्धान्ताः । पञ्चम्यो द्वावाद्यौ व्याख्यातो लाटदेवेन ॥ पौलिशकृतः स्फुटोसौ तस्यासन्नस्तु रोमकः प्रोक्तः । स्पष्टतरः सावित्रः परिशेषौ दूरविभ्रष्टौ । पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका I. 3-4. It is said here that पौलिश and रोमक were commented upon by लाटदेव, that the Sūryasiddhānta is most accurate, Pauliśa is accurate and Romaka approaches it in accuracy and that Vāsiṣṭha and Pitāmaha are far from accurate, Thibaut (in Intro, to पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका PP. XLIX-L) holds that Pauliśa-siddhānta known to Utpala (about 966 A D.) was different from the one known to Varāhamihira, that both Romaka and Pauliśa known to Varāha could not be placed later than 400 A.D. (Intro. p. XXXIII).

## Greek influence and Siddhāntas

In the first place no Indian work of the Siddhānta class admits that any Yavana knowledge was at the basis of the Indian astronomy nor do these ancient Sanskrit works on _astronomy_ set out any large number of purely astronomical terms of Greek origin as Varāha does in astrology. The subjects to be dealt with in the Pañcasiddhāntikā are set out in chap. I. verses 5-7 and there is hardly any word therein that can be said to be originally Greek. Reliance is placed by Weber and others on the fact that two of the five Siddhāntas the characteristics of which are summarised by Varāhamihira in his _Karaṇa_[^740] called Pañcasiddhāntikā are designated Romaka and Pauliśa and it is argued that this clearly suggests Greek influence. One should like to know the number of purely Greek astronomical words employed in the Siddhāntas (older than Varāha) and different from the 36 or 37 Greek words said to have been employed in Sanskrit astrology by Varāha and others. Conceding for argument that Romaka stands for the Alexandrian school that does not prove Greek influence on the Siddhāntas. There is hardly any evidence to show that any medieval work or calendar in India followed or was based mainly upon the data of the Romaka.[^741] The length of its year is 365 days, 5 hours, 55 minutes and 12 seconds which exactly agrees with the determination of the extent of the year given by Hipparchus and accepted by Ptolemy (Thibaut in Grundriss p. 42). The rules set up by Varāha for _ahargaṇa_ according to Romaka give results for the meridian of Yavanapura (and not for that of Ujjayini). It did not occur to any Western scholar so far that the Romaka-siddhānta being in Sanskrit was most probably Composed by some Greek [^742] settled in India familiar with Sanskrit as well as with the Greek or Alexandrian astronomy that preceded Ptolemy and probably even Hipparchus and that therefore Varāha gave a summary of it in his _karaṇa_, just as in his famous work on Astrology, the Bṛhajjātaka, he mentions the views of the Yavanas and frequently differs from them. Further Varāha is generous in his appreciation of Greek astrology [^743] 'Yavanas are indeed Mlecchas and this śāstra is well cultivated (or established) among them; even they (the Yavanas) are honoured as if they were sages. What need it be said about a Brāhmaṇa well-versed in Astrology (he will be honoured much more)'.

[^740]: Difference is made between a siddhānta work and a karaṇa. The latter is a compendious astronomical work which does not discuss astronomical theories at length (as the siddhāntas do ) and furnishes a set of concise and approximately correct rules for the quick performance of the more important astronomical computations.

[^741]: Not only was the Romaka not followed, but a comparatively early writer Brahmagupta (born 598 A. D.) condemns it as beyond the pale of smṛtis: युगमन्वन्तरकल्पाः कालपरिच्छेदकाः स्मृतावुक्ताः। यस्मान्न रामके ते स्मृतिबाह्यो रोमकस्तस्मात् ॥ ब्राह्मस्फुटसिद्धान्त I. 13 quoted by S. B. Dikshit in I. A vol. 19 pp. 133-142, where Mr. Dikshit contends that the Romaka summarised in the Pañcasiddhāntikā is different from the Romaka of Śriṣeṇa and that the former was composed before 150 A D.

[^742]: The Pauliśa-siddhānta is supposed by Weber to have been borrowed from Paulus Alexandrinus (4th century A. D.). Kern (preface to Br. S. p. 49 ) rebukes Weber for proceeding to this conclusion on the slender ground of the identity of name, bat Kern himself feels that Pauliśa was a Greek. D. E. Smith in 'History of Mathematics' (ed. of 1922, vol. I. p. 145 ) avers that Greek scholars settled in India after Alexander's time. In my paper on 'Yavanesvara and Utpala' contributed to the J. B. B. R. A. S, vol. 30 parts 1 and 2 pp. 1-8. I refer to two extensive works on astrology in several thousands of fine Upajāti and Indravajrā verses composed by Sphujidhvaja and Minarāja, both of whom claim to be the overlords of Yavanas. The Besnagar column Vaiṣṇava inscription on the Garuḍadhvaja in honour of Vāsudeva by Heliodora, a devotee of Vāsudeva and son of Diya and hailing from Takṣaśila (Taxila) who was a Yona (Yavana ) ambassador of king Antalikita (Antalkidas) to the court of king Bhāgabhadra shows how even high-placed Greeks became devotees of Vāsudeva, settled in India and got the inscription engraved not in Greek nor in bilingual characters, but in the Indian language and _lipi_. Vide W. W. Tarn in 'Greeks in Bactria and India' pp. 313-14, 380-81, 390-91 for Greeks knowing Indian languages, for many Greeks becoming Indianized and J. R. A. S. for 1909 pp. 1053–1056, 1087–1094, J. B, B. R. A. S. vol. 23 p. 104 and I. H. &. vol. VIII (for 1932) p. 611 for the Besnagar Inscription.

[^743]: म्लेच्छा हि यवनास्तेषु सम्यक शास्त्रमिदं स्थितम् । ऋषिवत्तेऽपि पूज्यन्ते किं पुनदैवविद् द्विजः॥ बृहत्संहिता II.15 (Kern). Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I.p. 23) refers to this verse. In पाणिनि IV. 1.49 twelve words (इन्द्रवरुण...यवनमातुलाचार्याणामानुक्)  are mentioned to most of which the affix आनी is added in the sense of 'Wife'. The word यवन is an exact reproduction of the word Ionia, which was originally a strip of mountainous coast in Asia Minor about 20 to 30 miles broad. There is nothing to show, as Western writers are fond of saying, that Pāniṇi refers to Alexander and the Greeks that came with and after him, Miletus was in the 6th century B. C. the richest city in the Greek world. In Pāṇini's days यवनानी meant tbe wife of a yavana while in Kātyāyana's days यवनानी meant only the yavana alphabet. Later on all Greeks came to be called Ionians, Vide Will Durant in 'Life of Greece' (1939) p. 134, Sarton in ' A History of Science' p. 162.

## Varāha and Yavana Astronomy

The word 'śāstra' in this verse when read along with 'daivavid' in the 2nd half must be taken in the sense of 'horā-śāstra'. But Varāha nowhere pays a similar compliment to Yavanas about their proficiency in Astronomy and Mathematics. This would suggest that in astronomy he did not rate them high or did not think they had anything special to impart to Indians or at least he did not base his astronomical theories on the works of Greek astronomers. He hardly ever employs any Greek words that are not already employed in his work on astrology.

Thibaut (Grundriss, p. 42 ) holds that the name Puliśa has decidedly a non-Indian appearance. One fails to understand why these learned writers are so positive about a certain name being non-Indian. We have in Sanskrit such ancient names as Pulastya, [^744] Pulaha, Paulastya (for Kubera ) which contain most of the elements of the word Puliśa and are very similar to it. 'Even in these days Hindus bear such names as Nabobsingh. The siddhāntas are called Paitāmaha and Pauliśa because they were deemed to have been composed by Pitāmaha and Puliśa. Alberuni, Thibaut says, traces the name Puliśa to a Greek author Paulus; but Alberuni who was familiar with both Indian and Greek authors might have committed a mistake, as even such a scholar as Weber, whose vast reading and phenomenal industry are a marvel, was misled by mere similarity in name and one recalls what was said in the drama Śakuntala by the attendant of Śakuntalā's little son that the child was misled by the similarity of names. Thibaut himself admits that it cannot be proved that the Pauliśa siddhānta is related to the work of the Greek astrologer Paulus. Pauliśa-siddhānta appears to have restricted itself mostly to astronomical matters. We have seen (p. 488) that the Paitāmaha-siddhānta was composed about 80 A. D. Therefore, that Siddhānta could not have borrowed anything from Ptolemy ( 150 A. D.). Prof. Neugebauer again has [^744a] no doubt that the original impetus to scientific Hindu astronomy came from Hellenistic astronomy, since he thinks that the use of the eccentric-epicyclic model alone is sufficient proof.

[^744]: Pulastya is quoted about a dozen times by Aparārka (first half of 12th century A. D.) and about three dozen times by the Smṛticandrikā (first half of 13th century A. D.) as a writer on Smṛti and Pulaha also is quoted as a Smṛti writer by the latter work. Manu I. 35 speaks of Pulastya and Pulaha as two of the ten sons of Prajāpati. Pulastya and Pulaha are two of the seven sages (in Bṛ. S. 13. 11).

[^744a]: Vide 'Journal of Near Eastern Studies' vol. IV. at p. 30 (Prof. Neugebauer on 'History of Ancient Astronomy'). Whitney also (Sūryasiddhānta in J. A. O. S. vol. VI. p. 474-75) suggested that it was pre-Ptolemaic Astronomy that was transmitted to India and Prof. Neugebauer, relying only on a few translated Sanskrit texts, probably repeats what Whitney suggested without any substantial evidence, Prof. Neugebauer in J. A. O. S. vol. 70 (1950) p. 7 admits that scholars are very far from a real insight into the development of Hellenistic astronomy before Ptolemy. In his review of the work on Indian studies by Professors Renou and Filliozat Prof. Neugebauer seems to hold that the discussion of Greek influence on Hindu astronomy and mathematics is of very little interest, since most of the Greek material was well known in Mesopotamia in the middle of the 2nd millenium B.C. and might have spread from Mesopotamia towards the east (vide ‘Archives Internationales d'Histoire des Sciences' for April-June 1955 at p. 170).

But he is inclined to hold that the period of reception lies between Hipparchus and Ptolemy and hopes that a systematic study of Hindu astronomical works might reveal information about pre-Ptolemaic Greek astronomy no longer preserved in available Greek sources. It is doubtful whether that hope will ever be fulfilled. If ancient Indians were capable of analysing the elements of the Sanskrit language and raising such a system as Pāṇini's, if they could plumb the depths of the human mind and create a mental discipline like the Yoga, if they carefully noted centuries before Christ the parts of the glottis and other organs in the mouth in the production of the letters of their language and produced the Prātiśākhyas and Śikṣā works, if they could create a fable literature and invent the game of chess and make a gift of these two to the whole of mankind, if their knowledge of Algebra was of a superior order (vide Colebrooke's Essays, vol. II, at p. 446 and Cajori's 'a History of Elementary Mathematics' pp. 93-101), if they invented the decimal place value[^744b] system for numbers and propagated it and the sign for a zero to Europe through the Arabs in the 12th century A. D., there is hardly any compelling reason for saying that it would not have been possible for them to arrive at their own eccentric and epicycle system (of which Prof. Neugebauer makes so much) independently of any other people to explain the supposed motions of the Sun, the Moon and the planets round the earth.

[^744b]: Mesopotamians used 60 as their basic number instead of 10. With them each position counted for 60 and not for ten. 123 in our decimal place value system is equal to 1 x 10[2]' + 2 x 10' plus 3. A similar notation in Mesopotamia would give 60[2]' + 2 x 60' plus 3 = 3723. For numbers below 60 the notation was clumsy as a dividing line bad to be used for the tens and integers.

## Indian Astronomy and Greek influence

One more observation must be made here. The VedāṅgaJyotiṣa [^745] says 'The sun and the moon start towards the north in the month of Māgha at the beginning of Śraviṣṭhā (i.e. Dhaniṣṭhā) and the Sun starts towards the south in the middle of Āśleṣā in the month of Srāvaṇa' i.e. winter solstice was in the beginning of Dhaniṣṭhā. In the Bṛhatsaṁhitā Varāhamihira tells us that in his day the two _ayanas_ of the Sun took place at the beginning of Karkaṭaka and of Makara respectively, that indeed at some time in the past _Uttarāyaṇa_ began at the beginning of Dhaniṣṭhā and _dakṣiṇāyana_ commenced in the middle of Āśleṣā and that therefore it was so declared in former śāstras. This shows that, between about 505 A. D. when Varāha planned and probably wrote his Pañca-siddhāntikā and the observation contained in the Vedāṅga-jyotiṣa, the commencement of Dakṣināyana had shifted from the middle of Āśleṣā to the last quarter of Punarvasu i.e. in all about 23 degrees and 20 minutes. Varāhamihira makes no effort to explain this. It is therefore quite reasonable to argue that he was probably not aware of the theory of the precession of the equinoxes. Authorities are not in complete agreement as to the yearly extent of precession. Taking it at 50.2 seconds per year, the total number of years between Varāha and the date of the observation in Vedāṅgajyotiṣa would be about 1673 and deducting 505 years (the time of Varāha's epoch for a siddhānta calculation) the observation would refer itself to about 1168 B. C. If Varāha and his predecessors had borrowed scientific astronomy directly from the Greeks, they should have been quite aware of the precession of equinoxes, since precession is said to have been discovered by Hipparchus, and was adopted by Ptolemy.[^745a]

[^745]:  प्रपद्येते श्रविष्ठादौ सूर्याचन्द्रमसावुदक् । सार्पार्धे दक्षिणार्कस्य माघश्रावणयोः सदा। वेदाङ्गज्योतिष (of ऋग्वेद), verse 6 (and 7 of यजुर्वेदाङ्गज्योतिष), आश्लेषार्धाद् दक्षिणमुत्तरमयनं रवेर्धनिष्ठाद्यम् । नूनं कदाचिदासीद्येनोक्तं पूर्वशास्त्रेषु॥ सांप्रतमयनं सवितुः कर्कटकाद्यं मृगादितश्चान्यत् । बृहत्संहिता III. 1-2. सार्प means आश्लेषा, of which the presiding deity is serpents. पूर्वशास्त्रेषु refers to वेदाङ्गज्योतिष and similar works. The पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका (II. 21 p. 9) refers to this : आश्लेषार्धादासीद्यदा निवृत्तिः किलोष्णकिरणस्य । युक्तमयनं तदासीत्साम्प्रतमयनं पुनर्वसुतः॥. We find in the बौ. श्री. सूत्र a passage almost identical with वेदाङ्गज्योतिष verse 7, viz. माघमासे धनिष्ठाभिरुत्तरेणैति भानुमानर्धाश्लेषस्य श्रावणस्य दक्षिणेनोपनिवर्तत इति। (26.29). The words माघ...भानुमान form a half अनुष्टुप् verse.

[^745a]: Vide 'Greek Astronomy' by Heath p. 611 and Prof. Neugebauer in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. IV. p. 24. In the Poona Orientalist vol. VIII. pp. 68-80 Mr. Raja Rao endeavours to prove that ancient Pravargya legend is based on a knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes. In the first place, too much has to be taken for granted to make that thesis probable and in the 2nd place it would have to be admitted that precession, though known in the Vedic age, was forgotten before the times of Varāhamihira who is apparently not aware of it. ; Prof. K. V. Abhyankar (in Dhruva commemoration vol. III. pp. 155-164) tries to show that 'precession of the equinoxes' had been discovered in India in ancient times, but his arguments are far-fetched and not at all convincing.

This consideration has special force in view of the fact that Varāha believed that the constellation of the Saptarṣis ( Ursa Major) was in the Maghās at the time when Yudhiṣṭhira ruled, that that star group remains for one hundred years in each of the 27 nakṣatras and that therefore to complete one cycle through all nakṣatras the star group of Saptarṣis required 2700 years.[^746]

There are other serious difficulties also in holding that the Sanskrit scientific astronomical treatises were acquainted with or borrowed from Ptolemy's work, Numerous discrepancies in essential matters exist between Ptolemy's work and Hindu astronomical works such as the assignment of different dimensions to the epicycles of the planets by Ptolemy and by Hindu writers. Therefore, it is altogether improbable that the Hindu works were directly based on Ptolemy's work. Nor is there any direct evidence to show that Hindu works were based on Hipparchus or the works of other Greek writers.

[^746]: आसन्मघासु मुनयः शासति पृथिवीं युधिष्ठिरे नृपतौ । षड्द्विकपञ्चद्वियुतः शककालस्तस्य राज्ञश्च। एकैकस्मिन्नृक्षे शतं शतं ते चरन्ति वर्षाणाम् ॥. Several Purāṇas mention that the Saptarṣis were in Maghā at the time of Parikṣit and that they are in one nakṣatra for a hundred years. Vide वायु 99. 421-23, मत्स्य 273. 42-44; on वृ. सं 13. 3-4, उत्पल quotes a verse of Vṛddha Garga who is earlier by some centuries than  वराहमिहिर “कलिद्वापरसंधौ तु स्थितास्ते पितृदैवतम् । मुनयो धर्मनिरताः प्रजानां पालने रताः ॥" पितरः are the deity of मघा. In the विष्णुपुराण IV. 33.34 it is said that at the time of king Parikṣit the Saptarṣis were in Maghā nakṣatra. In बृहत्सं. 13. 2 वराह promises that he would follow the doctrines of वृद्धगर्ग about the motion of Saptarṣis (Ursa Major ). According to the Śalyaparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 37. 14-15) Vṛddha-Garga was an adept in the computation of time and in auspicious and inauspicious phenomena and a holy place on the Sarasvati river was named Gargasrotas, which Balarama is said to have visited. Therefore, Vṛddhagarga must have preceded Varāha by many centuries.

## No proof of Greek influence

No such Greek works are now available nor are even Greek elementary manuals of astronomers available which can be said to agree with Hindu scientific works. That an extensive Sanskrit literature on astronomy has perished is clear from Varāhamihira's works and Utpala's quotations in his commentaries on the Bṛ. S. and Bṛhaj-jātaka. Modern Western writers would do well to observe at least for the present a non-committal attitude instead of repeating _ad nauseum_ that Hindu scientific astronomy was derived from Greeks on slender similarities between the two systems and on obscure and ill understood passages and extracts in old astronomical works (vide E. Burgess in J. A. O. S. vol. VI at p. 480).

After having briefly indicated the astronomical knowledge to be gathered from Vedic works, it is now necessary to show that astrological knowledge is also found in the Vedic texts from the oldest times. The human mind is very curious to know the future and is very prone to regard certain days, times and appearances as auspicious or favourable and others as inauspicious. Various means were adopted by ancient peoples to pry into the future. The word astrology is now generally understood[^747] to mean the predictions about what would befall an individual based on the configurations of the Sun, the moon and the planets at the time of his birth. But this was not the sense or at least the only sense in which the word was used in very ancient times. Astrology known to us from the ancient Assyrians was concerned almost wholly with the interpretation of celestial phenomena and planetary configurations and the predictions about the immediate future in relation to the country, its people, its government or king, in such matters as the crops, floods, storms, invasions or other calamities. The events in the heavens, in the sky and even on the earth were supposed to intimate the thoughts of the gods, and to convey indications about impending happenings. This may be called natural astrology. Horoscopic astrology is a later development. Predictions were also derived by skilled diviners from various other happenings such as dreams, the flight and cries of birds, and the interpretation of the mysterious signs on the livers [^748] of the sheep killed in sacrifices to gods in Babylon and Rome.

The first thing that we notice is that even in the Ṛgveda we have frequent references to 'auspiciousness of days' (_sudinatve ahnām_) in R̥g. III. 8.5, III. 23.4, VII. 88.4, X. 70.1, ('sudinatvamahnām' in R̥g. II. 21. 6 and 'sudineṣvahnām' in R̥g. IV. 37.1). A few of these may be translated here. 'O Indra! establish amongst us abundance of wealth, freedom from injury to our bodies, sweetness of speech and luckiness of days' (R̥g. II. 21.6); '(The sacrificial post) when planted on an auspicious day goes prospering in the sacrifice attended by many men'(R̥g. III. 8.5 );

[^748]: Vide Breasted in 'Ancient Times' p. 175, Cambridge Ancient History vol. I. p. 409. This lore called 'Hepatoscopy does not appear to have been developed in India. Vide 'Hepatoscopy and Astrology in Babylonia and Assyria', a paper in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. XLVII, pp. 646-676. Divination is either voluntary or involuntary. In the former marked arrows were used ( apparently referred to in Ezekiel 21. 21 ) or birds were sent out and the directions in which they flew were noted and interpreted or such things as dipping buds or flowers in water and placing them at the feet of the images of gods in India and noting whether the flowers on the right or left side fell down first. Involuntary divination depends on all kinds of signs, phenomena and happenings that force themselves on one's attention such as aspects of the sun, the moon, planets, lightning and clouds, dreams, chirping of birds and falling of lizards on one's body and the like. The Babylonian and Assyrian priests attached to temples made very extensive collections of omens and portents, but the interpretations almost exclusively concerned general welfare (viz. crops, pestilence, war, famine, plenty &c.) and if an individual was referred to it was only the king. The theory underlying hepatoscopy was that the animal offered was assimilated to the deity and the soul of the animal entered into the inner being of the god. The seat of life and of the soul was supposed to be the liver. The chief parts of the liver were the right and left lower lobes. Among the Romans the heart and lungs also were examined, the right representing the favourable side and left the unfavourable side. The priests did not hesitate to announce to the king unfavourable results and applied their systems consistently. Astrology represented a comparatively more scientific view of the universe. The planets came to be regarded as gods even in the oldest astrological texts in which the five planets were identified with the chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon, viz. Jupiter with Marduk, Venus with Ishtar, Saturn with Ninib, Mercury with Nebo and Mars with Nergal, Jupiter (=Marduk p. 654) being always mentioned first. It was believed that through the planets and stars one can see gods at work. Prognostications varied according to the season or month of the year and the day. The Greek astrology offered a great contrast to the Babylonian, since in the former the individual came to be all in all. The Greek astronomers obtained from the Babylonians the names for the constellations of the eclipitic, which are used even now in Europe. Vide Jastrow's 'Religion of Babylon and Assyria' p. 370 for identification of Marduk, Ishtar and other Babylonian gods with planets and p. 371 for the fact that Ishtar (Venus) figures most prominently among the preserved astrological texts and 'Babylonian and Assyrian Religion' by S. H. Hooke pp. 24-30.

## Ṛgveda references to auspicious days

'O Agni! I establish thee on the best place of the earth (the _uttaravedi_), the place of worship and for libation, securing luckiness of day; may you shine opulently on the (river) Dṛṣadvati, on the concourse of people, on the river Āpayā and on Sarasvati (R̥g. III, 23.4).[^749]

There are several other passages in which a wish is expressed that the days would be auspicious or lucky for sacrificers etc. Vide R̥g. IV. 4. 7, V. 60.5, VII. 11, 2, VII, 18. 21, 1. 124.2 (May new dawns like the past ones shine for us with wealth and lucky days ), X. 39.12.[^749a]

It has already been seen above (note [^726] ) that in Ṛgvedic times cows were driven (by way of dowry) to the bridegroom's house on Aghās (Maghās) and the bride was carried in a chariot to the bridegroom's house after the marriage on the Arjuni (or Phalguni) nakṣatra. In accordance with this the nakṣatras on which marriage should be celebrated are enumerated in the Baud. gr. as Rohiṇi, Mṛgaśīrsa, Uttarā-Phalguni and Svāti.

It has already been shown above (on p. 506) how _Agnyādheya_ (the setting up of the sacred fires) was to be performed on one of seven nakṣatras or in spring, summer and autumn according to the _varṇā_ (class) of the performer (vide Kāṭhaka S. 8.1, Sat. Br. II. 1.2, Tai. Br. I. 1.2.6-7). But an exception was recognized in the case of one performing a Soma sacrifice. It was provided that whenever a man had a desire to perform a Soma sacrifice he might establish the sacred fires in any season and that would bring prosperity to him.[^750].

[^749]:  पोषं रयीणामरिष्टिं तनूनां स्वाड्नानं वाचः सुदिनत्वमह्नाम् ॥ ऋ. II. 21,6; जातो जायते सुदिनत्वे अह्नां समय आ विदथे वर्धमानः । ऋ. III. 8.5; नि त्वा दधे वर आ पृथिव्या इलायास्पदे सुदिनत्वे अह्वाम् । दृषद्वत्यां मानुष आपयायां सरस्वत्यां रेवदग्ने दिदीहि । ऋ. III. 23. 4.

[^749a]: The Greeks held the waxing moon lucky and the waning moon unlucky. Hesiodic system (which is at least several centuries later than the Ṛgveda) furnishes the earliest evidence for lucky and unlucky days, though Hesiod admits that there was divergence of opinion on that point. Hesiod puts a special ban on the 5th day of the month, while the 7th day was sacred to Apollo in Greece and was held sacred in Babylon also. Vide L. R. arnell in 'Greece and Babylon' p. 294.

[^750]: अथो खलु यदेवैनं यज्ञ उपनमेदथादधीत । सैवास्यर्धिः । तै. ब्रा. . I. 1. 2.8; सोमेन यजा इति वा अग्निमाधत्ते यस्मिन्नेव कस्मिंश्चर्ता आदधीत सोमेन यक्ष्यमाणः। काठक 8. 1.


In ancient Vedic passages no clear line of demarcation appears between what may be called natural astrology and individual astrology. For example, in the Tai. Br.[^751] it is provided that people plough their fields on Anurādhā nakṣatra, of which Mitra is the presiding deity. The Pāraksaragṛhya prescribes in the same strain that a man should put the ploughshare (in his field) on an auspicious day or on Jyeṣṭhā nakṣatra of which Indra is the presiding deity (and rains are in the hands of Indra). On the other hand, the same Brāhmaṇa [^752] (Taittiriya) provides that if a man desires that his daughter should be dear to her husband he should get her married when the moon is in Niṣṭyā (Svāti) nakṣatra and that if he does so his daughter becomes dear to her husband and never comes back to her father's house. The nakṣatras from Kṛttikā to Viśākhā have been declared to be Devanakṣatras and whatever rites are performed on them are declared to have been performed on a holy day (_punyāha_). Even as early as the Atharvaveda [^753] it appears to have been believed that a boy born on Jyeṣṭhā or on Vicṛt (i.e. Mūla nakṣatra) or on a day called tiger-like (on an evil or terrible nakṣatra) might himself die or bring about the death of his father or mother. The two verses may be translated as follows: '(the boy) is born on Jyeṣṭhāghni (i.e. Jyeṣṭhā) or on Vicṛt which belongs to Yama; guard him against being uprooted; may (Agni) take him beyond all evil results in order that he may reach the long life of a hundred autumns. This valiant son was born on a tiger-like day and nakṣatra; may he not, while he grows, kill his father or his mother that gave him birth.'

Vide उदगातां भगवती विचृतौ नाम तारके। विक्षेत्रियस्य मुञ्चतामधमं पाशमुत्तमम् ॥अथर्व. 11. 8.1 compare also III. 7.4 and VI. 121. 3. The Kauśikasūtra (46.25 ) prescribes अथर्व० (VI. 110) as a hymn to be repeated in a Śanti rite for one born on an evil nakṣatra.

## Nakṣatras auspicious or evil

Thus it appears that some nakṣatras were called _puṇya_ (auspicious or holy) as in Tai. Br. I. 5.2.1 or III. 1, 2.8, while some others (like Jyeṣṭhā, Mūla) were held to be _pāpa_ (evil) nakṣatras.

From a passage in the [^754] Bṛ. Up. it appears that certain nakṣatras were called male "if a man desires 'May I reach greatness' he should observe milk diet for twelve days beginning in the northward passage of the Sun, in the bright half of a month and on a favourable day he offers into the fire on a male nakṣatra &c."

From the above examples it will be apparent that prognostications were based in very early Vedic times on the nakṣatras either of birth or on nakṣatras deemed auspicious or inauspicious. Puṣya appears to have been regarded as a very auspicious nakṣatra long before Pāṇini, who mentions another name of it as 'Sidhya'. But in these early times it does not appear that any rules had been arrived at about the influence of planets (except perhaps of Jupiter in Puṣya) in certain nakṣatras or about horoscopes with planets in nakṣatras or rāśis (signs of the zodiac) or in certain 'houses'. In those days prognostications were confined mainly to nakṣatras, days and natural phenomena and bodily marks. For example, Pāṇini I. 4. 39 ('राधीक्ष्योर्यस्य विप्रश्नः') provides a rule for a diviner considering the good or bad luck of a person. The काशिका explains 'विविधः प्रश्नः विप्रश्नः। स कस्य भवति यस्य शुभाशुभं पृच्छयत। देवदत्ताय राध्यति ईक्षते वा नैमित्तिकः पृष्टः सन् देवदत्तस्य दैवं पर्यालोचयति'. In पाणिनि IV. 3, 73 'अणृगयनादिभ्यः' it is provided that the affix अण् (and not ठक्) is applied in the sense of 'तत्र भवः' or 'तस्य व्याख्यानः ' to the words in the ऋगयनगण, which contains among others the words अङ्गविद्या, उत्पात and निमित्त (i.e. नैमित्तिक and औत्पातिक would mean 'one who expounds the future consequences indicated by उत्पात i.e. earthquake &c. and निमित्त throbbing &c.). Under पाणिनि III, 2.53 the काशिका gives the examples जायाघ्नस्तिलकालकः, पतिघ्नी पाणिरेखा (line on the palm ).

[^754]: स यः कामयेत महत्प्राप्नुयामित्युदगयने आपूर्यमाणपक्षस्य पुण्याहे द्वादशाहमुपवस द्व्रती भूत्वा...पुंसा नक्षत्रेण मन्थं संनीय जुहोति । वृह. उ. VI. 3.1; compare a similar passage in छा. उ. V. 2. 4-9 and कौषी. उ. II. 3. In later times there was some difference of opinion as to male nakstras: मातृदत्त on हिरण्यकेशिगृह्य I. 1.5 says 'अश्वयुक् पुनर्वसू तिष्यो हस्तः शतभिषक् प्रोष्ठपदा इति पुंनामधेयानि नक्षत्राणि,' while स्मृतिच. I. p. 17 quotes from रत्नकोश 'हस्तो मूलं श्रवणः पुनर्वसुर्मृगशिरास्तथा पुण्यः । पुंसंज्ञितेषु कार्येषु ह्येतानि शुभानि धिष्ण्यानि" ।.

We find from certain verses of the Ṛgveda that the cries of such birds as kapiñjala were deemed even in those ancient timesto indicate coming events, auspicious or otherwise; [^755] '(the bird) crying again and again and voicing (indicating) coming event sends forth his speech as an oarsman propels a boat; O bird! may you be auspicious to us and may no unfavourable sign reach you from any quarter; O bird! may you that are auspicious and whose cry forebodes good cry to the south of (our) houses; may no thief master us nor may any one declare that we may meet danger.' Br. S. 98. 14 provides that birds indicate to a person going on a journey the evil results of actions, good or evil, done by him in former lives. The Yoga-yātrā of Varāhamihira (chap. 14) and Adbhutasāgara pp. 569-582 deal at length with _śakuna_ (prognostications from the sight, flight or cries of birds and other animals). Yogayātrā (14.2 and 26 ) provides that certain birds and animals when they are to the right or _southern_ side of a man starting on a journey indicate auspicious results and that when a cāṣa bird with something in its mouth flies to the right side of a man that is an indication of welfare.

The result of the dependence on ideas of lucky and unlucky days and nakṣatras was that some people began to make observations and deduce conclusions and a lore called 'nakṣatra-vidyā' arose. When Nārada approached the great teacher Sanatkumāra for knowledge, the latter questioned him as to what he already knew and then Nārada enumerated a long list of lores (including [^756] the four Vedas, Itihāsa-purāṇa), one of which is 'nakṣatravidyā' ('the science of nakṣatras' i.e. astronomy and astrology ). It can be easily imagined how credulous people in ancient times as even in these days consulted those who professed to know what the stars foretold and were often deceived or felt frustrated. Hence arose even in early times a prejudice against star-gazers, astrologers and the like.

[^755]: कनिक्रदज्जनुषं प्रब्रुवाण इयर्ति वाचमरितेच नावम् । सुमङ्गलश्च शकुने भवासि मा त्वा काचिदभिभा विश्व्याविदत् ॥ अव क्रन्द दक्षिणतो गृहाणां सुमङ्गलो भद्रवादी शकुन्ते। मा नः स्तेन ईशत माघशंसो बृहद्वदेम विदथे सुवीराः ॥ ऋ. II. 42. 1 and 3. The first verse is explained in the निरुक्त IX. 4. The आश्व. गृ. III. 10. 9 prescribes that one on hearing the unpleasant cries of birds should recite inaudibly the two hymns Rg. II. 42 and 43. The word अभिभा occurs only once in the ऋग्वेद compare 'मो नो विददभिभा मो अशस्तिर्मा नो विदद् वृजिना द्वेष्या या'।.अथर्व. I. 20. 1, V. 36.


[^756]: स होवाचर्ग्वेदं भगवोऽध्येमि यजुर्वेदं सामवेदमाथर्वणं चतुर्थमितिहासपुराणं पञ्चमं वेदानां वेदं... नक्षत्रविद्यां सर्पदेवजनविद्यामेतद्भगवोऽध्येमि। छा. उ. VII. 1. 23; also छा. उ. VII. 7.1.

One of the earliest references to this prejudice against stargazers in Sanskrit literature is found in the Tai. Bṛ. III, 4. 4 and Vāj. S. 30. 10 and 20, where the [^757] 'nakṣatradarśa' (star-gazer) is made over as a victim to _prajñāna_ and the 'gaṇaka'( calculator of the movements of stars and planets) is consigned to aquatic animals along with the headman of the village. Among the long list of brāhmaṇas that should not be invited for religious rites in honour of gods or in _śrāddhas_, Manu (III, 162 ) includes one who maintains himself by the practice of astrology (nakṣatrairyaśca jīvati) and in (VI. 50 ) Manu prohibits ascetics from desiring to secure alms by foretelling the results of portents (like earth-quakes) or of bodily [^758] movements (such as the throbbing of the eye or arm ) or by nakṣatravidyā ( astrology ) or _aṅgavidyā_ (palmistry) or by casuistry or by telling what the śāstra ordains on a (disputed) point. The ancient sūtras of Hārīta and of Saṅkhalikhita declare that a _nakṣatrajivin_ (one who lives by practising astrology) and a 'nakṣatrādeśavṛtti' (who makes his livelihood by conveying the message of nakṣatras ) respectively are unfit to sit in a row with other brāhmaṇas (q. by Kr̥tyakalpataru on śrāddha p. 88). Similarly, Sumantu (in a prose passage q. on śrāddha by Kr̥tyakalpataru p. 91 ) states the same about a 'mūlyasāṁvatsarika' (who practises astrology for money ). The Viṣṇudharma-sūtra (chap. 82.7) includes those who maintain themselves by astrology (nakṣatrajivinaḥ) among those who are not to be invited for śrāddha rites. Similarly, the Tevijjasutta ( S. B. E. vol. XI. pp. 196–197) and Mahāśila in Dighanikāya (I. p. 68 ) condemn for Buddhist monks maintenance by such low arts as guessing at the length of a man's life or by foretelling future events (such as eclipses, falling meteors, victory and defeat &c.). But the mere study of constellations is allowed by Buddha (in S. B. E. vol. XX. pp. 292-294). Among obstacles to gain [^759] Kauṭilya enumerates many such matters as passion of love, anger, timidity and desire to find out an auspicious tithi and nakṣatra' and winds up with two fine verses characteristic of the great genius that placed Candragupta Maurya on the throne of Magadha: "The desired object ( or wealth) eludes that childish man that is excessively in search of what the stars portend: for the desired object is ( itself) the star that governs ( success ) in securing it; what will stars do? Men striving ( to attain their ends ) will secure their objects after hundreds of efforts; wealth is caught by wealth just as elephants are bound by other elephants (opposed to them ).' From the above it is quite clear that several centuries before Christ an astrologer ( who maintained himself on money acquired by the practice of astrology) was very much condemned.

[^757]: प्रज्ञानाय नक्षत्रदर्शमाशिक्षायै प्रश्निनं। वाज. सं. 30. 10; यादसे शावल्यां ग्रामण्यं गणकमभिक्रोशकम् &c. I वाज. सं. 30. 20. In the Puruṣamedha the stargazer is assigned to 'prajñāna' (in order that he may collect thorough knowledge ) and the gaṇaka to aquatic animals (like sharks or crocodiles).

[^758]: न चोत्पातनिमित्ताभ्यां न नक्षत्राङ्गविद्यया । नानुशासनवादाभ्यां भिक्षां लिप्सेत कर्हिचित् ॥ मनु VI. 50 = वसिष्ठधर्मसूत्र  X. 21. In the 'r̥gayanādigaṇa (पा. IV. 3.73) the काशिका enumerates अङ्गविद्या.

[^759]: लाभविघ्नः कामः क्रोधः साध्वसं...मङ्गलतिथिनक्षत्रेष्टि(ष्ट?)त्वमिति । नक्षत्रमतिपृच्छन्तं बालमर्थोतिवर्तते । अर्थों ह्यर्थस्य नक्षत्रं किं करिष्यन्ति तारकाः ॥ साधनाः प्राप्नुवन्त्यर्थान् नरा यत्नशतैरपि । अर्थैरर्थाः प्रबध्यन्ते गजाः प्रतिगजैरिव ॥ अर्थशास्त्र, 9th अधिकरण, 4th chapter p. 351 (Sham shastri's ed. of 1919 ).

What Kauṭilya regards as reprehensible is extreme reliance on and pursuit of nakṣatra astrology, but it is not to be supposed that he ignored prognostications altogether. About the king's _purohita_ (priest ) he lays down the following [^760] 'the king should appoint as priest a person whose family and character are highly spoken of, who has well studied the Veda together with the six _aṅgas_, the divine and other portents and the science of the government of people and who can prevent divine and human calamities by means contained in the Atharvaveda, the king should follow him as a pupil does his teacher or a son his father or a servant his master'. Yāj. (I. 313), who is later than Kauṭilya by some centuries, also lays down in almost identical words that the king should appoint as _purohita_ one who is proficient in astrology, endowed with all requirements declared in śāstras, and is proficient in the science of government and the propitiatory and magic rites of the Atharvaveda'.

Another set of texts indicates another stage in the development of astrology based on nakṣatras, which seems to have been
somewhat on the lines of the later horoscopic system of ‘houses'. Traces of it exist though they are not very ancient. The Vaikhānasasmārta [^761] sūtra (IV. 14) refers to nakṣatras called Janma, Karma, Sāṅghātika, Sāmudayika and Vaināśika and these terms are explained in the Yogayātrā of Varāha and in the Viṣṇudharmottara-Purāṇa.[^762]

[^760]: पुरोहितमुदितोदितकुलशीलं षडङ्गे वेदे दैवे निमित्ते दण्डनीत्यां चाभिविनीतमापदा देवमानुषीणामथर्वभिरुपायैश्च प्रतिकर्तारं कुर्वीत । तमाचार्यं शिष्यः पितरं पुत्रो भृत्यः स्वामिनमिव चानुवर्तेत । अर्थशास्त्र I. 9. pp. 15-16; compare  याज्ञ. स्मृति I. 313 'पुरोहितं प्रकुर्वीत दैवज्ञमुदितोदितम् । दण्डनीत्यां च कुशलमथर्वाङ्गिरसे तथा ।'

[^761]: The date of the Vaikhānasasmārtasūtra is a difficult problem, but it lies probably between 200 B.C. to 200 A. D.

## Nakṣatra Astrology

The Yogayatra remarks[^763] - the nakṣatra on which a man is born is called _ādya_ (first), the tenth from it (from _ādya_ ) is called _karma_, the 16th nakṣatra from the ādya is called _sāṅghātika_ (pertaining to a group or a collection of human beings), the 18th (from ādya) is called _Samudāya_ (collection) and the 23rd (from ādya) is called _Vaināśika_ (lit. pertaining to death or destruction), the 25th (from ādya) is called _mānasa_ (pertaining to the mind); in this way all persons are concerned with six nakṣatras (1st, 10th, 16th, 18th, 23rd and 25th ); they say that the king is concerned with nine nakṣatras, the three additional ones being those connected with his _jāti_ (caste), his country and with the nakṣatra on the day of his coronation. The Yogayātrā and Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 78. 14-16) further provide 'when the nakṣatra of one's birth is affected by evil (star or aspect) the results are the appearance of disease, loss of money, and disputes; if the nakṣatra called _karma_ is affected then one's undertakings do not succeed; if the Sāṅghātika (16th) is affected then there is treachery; when the Sāmudayika (18th) is affected there is loss of accumulated wealth; when the Vaināśika (23rd) is affected, one's desired objects perish; when Mānasa (25th) is affected, there is anxiety and unhappiness. The Nārada purāṇa,[^763a] after defining the above, remarks that one should not commence any auspicious act on these. When the (six ) nakṣatras are not affected (by evil stars or aspects) a person is healthy, enjoys happiness, his body is well-nourished and he is endowed with wealth; but if the six nakṣatras are affected he perishes and the king also (meets the same fate) if the six along with the extra three are affected.

[^763]: जन्मर्क्षमाद्यं दशमं तु कर्म साङ्घातिकं षोडशमृक्षमाद्यात् । अष्टादशं स्यात् समुदायसंज्ञं वैनाशिकं विंशतितस्तृतीयम् । यत्पञ्चविंशं खलु मानसं तत् षड्ऋक्ष एवं पुरुषस्तु सर्वः। राज्ञो नवर्क्षाणि वदन्ति जाति-देशाभिषेकैः सहितानि तानि ॥ राज्ञोऽभिषेकर्क्षमुशन्ति मिश्रं साधारणे द्वे सह षड्भिराद्यैः॥ किं त्वत्र दोषाश्च गुणाश्च सर्वे प्रधानमेकं पुरुषं भजन्ते । रोगाम्यागमवित्तनाशकलहाः संपीडिते जन्मभे । सिद्धिं कर्म न याति कर्मणि हते भेदस्तु साङ्घातिके। द्रव्यस्योपचितस्य सामुदायिके संपीडिते संक्षयो बैनाशे च भवन्ति कार्यविपदश्चिन्तासुखं मानसे ॥ निरुपद्रुतभे निरामयः सुखभाक् पुष्टतनुर्धनान्वितः । षडुपद्रुतभो विनश्यति त्रिभिरन्यैश्च सहावनीश्वरः। योगयात्रा IX. 1-3 and 10. These occur in राजमार्ताण्ड folio 50a verses 780-81, 84,85. बृहद्योगयात्रा IV.14-15 (MS. in Bhau Daji Collection) are similar to योगयात्रा IX. 1-2.

[^763a]: जन्मभाद्दशमं कर्म सङ्घातर्क्षे तु षोडशम् । अष्टादश समुदयं त्रयोर्विंशं विनाशनम् । मानसं पंचविंशर्क्षे नाचरेत् शुभमेषु तु । नारदीय I. 56. 358-359.

When [^764] the nakṣatra on which a king was crowned is affected by evil planets or aspects, one should predict loss of the kingdom, if the nakṣatra of the country is affected trouble to the country and capital is indicated and if the nakṣatra of the king's caste is affected then one should predict king's illness. The nakṣatras according to the caste of the king are as follows [^765] : the three Pūrvas (Phalguni, Purvāṣāḍha and Purvābhādrapadā) and Kṛttikā are nakṣatras of the king of the brāhmaṇa class; the three Uttarās (Uttarā Phalguni, Uttarāṣāḍha and Uttarābhādrapada) and Puṣya are nakṣatras for a king of the kṣatriya caste; Revati, Anurādhā, Māgha and Rohiṇi, of agricultural class; Punarvasu, Hasta, Abhijit and Aśvini are nakṣatras of the _vaṇik_ (trader) class. The countries governed by the nakṣatras are set out in chap. 14 of the Bṛhat-saṁhitā. Herein Varāha differs from Ptolemy in two respects:(1) Varāha does not mention countries governed by rāśis, but countries governed by nakṣatras; (2) Varāha confines himself to India, while Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos ( 11. 3 pp. 157-159, Loeb Classical Library) deals with all countries then known. This is an important circumstance against the theory that Varāha's astrology is borrowed from Ptolemy or later Greek writers. If he had known Ptolemy's work he could have easily followed him even as to countries outside India. The whole of India is divided into nine parts, the Madhyadeśa and the regions in the eight quarters from the East to the North-east, each part being under groups of three nakṣatras from Kṛttikā onwards. Vide also Viṣṇudharmottara I. 86. 1-9. When the group of three nakṣatras in each of nine divisions is affected by the Sun, Mars or Saturn, the countries falling under any of the three nakṣatras of the group suffer calamities. The MārkaṇḍeyaPurāṇa (chap. 58. 10-54 in B. I. edition, chap. 55 in Venkateśvara Press edition) also specifies the countries in the nine groups, but the names differ to some extent. There is some divergence about the nomenclature also.

[^764]: पीडिते चाभिषेकर्क्षे राज्यभ्रंशं विनिर्दिशेत् । देशर्क्षे पीडिते पीडां देशस्य च पुरस्य च॥ पीडिते जातिनक्षत्रे राज्ञो व्याधिं विनिर्दिशेत् । विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 87. 17-18.

[^765]: The बृहत्संहिता (15. 28-30=योगयात्रा IX. 5-7) specifies the nakṣatras of brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, agriculturists, traders &c. Two may be quoted here: पूर्वात्रयं सानलमग्रजानां राज्ञां तु पुष्येण सहोत्तराणि । सपौष्णमैत्रं पितृदेवतं च प्रजापतेर्भ च कृषीवलानाम् ॥ आदित्यहस्ताभिजिदाश्चिनानि वणिग्जनानां प्रवदन्ति भानि । मूलत्रिनेत्रानिलपारुणानि भान्युग्रजातेः प्रभविष्णुतायाः॥; compare विष्णुधर्मोत्तरपुराण I. 87. 11-14 for verses similar to those in योगयात्रा. vide also अद्भुतसागर p. 464 which quotes बृहत्संहिता verses on जन्मर्क्ष and the other नक्षत्रs.

## Astrology based on nakṣatras

According to Parāśara and the Viṣṇudharmottara (1. 87, 7) the 4th nakṣatra from the nakṣatra of birth is called Mānasa. A nakṣatra [^766] is said to be affected (_upahata_) when the Sun or Saturn occupies it or when Mars is retrograde in it or occults it or an eclipse ( of the Sun or Moon) occurs in it or a meteor strikes it or when the moon continuously affects it (by occulting or occupying its middle or goes to the southern part of it). The Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 89. 1-13), Yogayātrā IX. 13-18, and Parāśara (quoted by the Adbhutasāgara pp. 271–274) prescribe certain _śānti_ rites for averting the evil effects of the above noted nine nakṣatras being affected. [^767]

It should be noted that in the astrology depending on twelve _rāśis_ and twelve _bhāvas_ ( places or houses ) _karma_ is the name given to the 10th house from the first (just as in the case of nakṣatra astrology ) and mṛtyu ( i.e. vināśa) is the name of the 8th _bhāva_.

The Mahābhārata and the Rāmāyaṇa contain numerous passages where the planets in relation to certain nakṣatras are stated to indicate misfortunes to people in general, to warring armies and to individuals. A few examples may be cited by way of illustration. When in the sanguinary battle between Rāvaṇa and Rāma, the former seemed to be getting the better of Rāma, the Rāmāyaṇa states [^768] Mercury stood covering the Rohiṇi nakṣatra which is presided over by Prajāpati and which is the favourite of the moon and thereby indicated evil fortune to people'. Similarly, it is said 'Mars stood covering the nakṣatra Viśākhā in the sky, which is presided over by Indra and Agni and which is the nakṣatra of the Kosalas'. In the Mahābhārata numerous statements are made about the position of the planets, the nakṣatras and tithis, which it is almost impossible to reconcile. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 903-923 for consideration of the astronomical data in the Mahābhārata.

[^766]: रविरविसुतभोगमागतं क्षितिसुतभेदनवक्रदूषितम्। ग्रहणगतमथोल्कया हतं नियतमुषाकरपीडितं च यत् ॥ तदुपहतमिति प्रचक्षते प्रकृतिविपर्यययातमेव वा । योगयात्रा IX. 8-9 = बृहत्संहिता 15. 31-32.

[^767]: In the Mālavikāgnimitra of Kālidāsa the Vidūṣaka says to the king in the 4th Act 'astrologers declare that your nakṣatra is afflicted and (therefore) you should release all persons confined in jails '.

[^768]: प्राजापत्यं च नक्षत्रं रोहिणीं शशिनः प्रियाम् । समाक्रम्य बुधस्तस्थौ प्रजानाम शुभावहः॥ कोसलानां च नक्षत्रं व्यक्तमिन्द्राग्निदेवतम् । आक्रम्याङ्गारकस्तस्थौ विशाखामपि चाम्बरे ॥ रामायण, युद्धकाण्ड 103, 30 and 33. The बालकाण्ड (5.5-6) states that the country of Kosala was situated on the Sarayū and Ayodhya was its capital. रघु, the ancestor of राम, is called कोसलेश्वर in रघुवंश IV. 70; vide also रघुवंश VII. 34. Acc. to बृहत्संहिता 14.8-10, कोशल is the first country in the south-east, of which आश्लेषा, मघा and पूर्वा are presiding नक्षत्रs.

 Here we are concerned only with the beliefs about certain omens and portents. In the Bhiṣma-parva we read [^769] 'a white celestial body stands traversing Citrā nakṣatra; one sees therein specially the destruction of the Kurus; a very frightful comet stands covering Puṣya-nakṣatra; this great _graha_ will bring about terrible evil to both armies. A white blazing _graha_ resembling fire emitting smoke stands covering the bright Jyeṣṭhā-nakṣatra whose presiding deity is Indra; a cruel comet standing between Citrā and Svāti afflicts Rohiṇi and the Sun and the Moon'.

There are several statements about Mars that are more or less irreconcilable[^770]. For example, the Udyogaparva says 'Mars having been retrograde in Jyeṣṭhā seeks (to reach or afflict?) Anurādhā presided over by Mitra, as if bringing death'; while Bhiṣma-parva remarks ‘Mars is retrogade in Maghā and Jupiter is in Śravaṇa and Saturn afflicts the nakṣatra presided over by Bhaga (i.e. Purvā Phalguni). About Saturn several[^771] statements are made a refulgent and malignant planet, Saturn, afflicts the nakṣatra (ruled over by Prajāpati i.e. Rohiṇi) and will afflict people more'; 'Saturn stands afflicting Rohiṇi'; Jupiter and Saturn are near Viśākhā'.

One very remarkable feature of the Mahābhārata passages is that while they put forward dozens of times the positions of the Sun, the Moon and planets in reference to nakṣatras, not a single passage gives the position of the planets in relation to _rāśis_, the signs of the Zodiac, or week-days (such as Tuesday, Sunday &c.).

[^769]: श्वेतो ग्रहस्तथा चित्रां समतिक्रम्य तिष्ठति । अभावं हि विशेषेण कुरूणां तत्र पश्यति । धूमकेतुर्महाघोरः पुष्यं चाक्रम्य तिष्ठति । सेनयोरशिवं घोरं करिष्यति महाग्रहः॥ ...श्वेतो ग्रहः प्रज्वलितः सधूम इव पावकः। ऐन्द्रं तेजस्वि नक्षत्रं ज्येष्ठामाक्रम्य तिष्ठति ॥ रोहिणीं पीडयत्येवमुभौ च शशिभास्करौ ॥ भीष्मपर्व 3. 12, 13, 16, 17.

[^770]: कृत्वा चाङ्गारको वक्र ज्येष्ठायां मधुसूदन। अनुराधां प्रार्थयते मैत्रं सङ्गमयन्निव। उद्योगपर्व 143. 9; मधास्वङ्गारको चक्रः श्रवणे च बृहस्पतिः। भर्ग नक्षत्रमाक्रम्य सूर्यपुत्रण पीड्यते ॥ भीष्म  3.14.

[^771]: प्राजापत्यं हि नक्षत्रं ग्रहस्तीक्ष्णो महाद्युतिः । शनैश्चरः पीडयति पीडयन् प्राणिनोऽधिकम् ॥ उद्योगपर्व 143, 8; रोहिणीं पीडयन्नेष स्थितो राजन् शनैस्चर: । भीष्म 2. 32; संवत्सरस्थायिनौ च ग्रहौ प्रज्वलितावुभौ । विशाखायाः समीपस्थौ बृहस्पतिशनैश्चरौ॥ भीष्म 3.27.

## Astrology of Ātharvaṇa-jyotiṣa

The Ātharvaṇa jyotiṣa furnishes a somewhat different scheme of nakṣatra astrology. It says:[^772] the 10th nakṣatra from the nakṣatra of a man's birth is called karma, the 19th (from janma-nakṣatra) is called garbhādhānaka (nakṣatra of conception), the 2nd, 11th and 20th constitute the group called _sampatkara_( bringing about prosperity), the 3rd, 12th and 21st (from janmanakṣatra) constitute the group of _vipatkara_ (bringing about ill-luck or distress), the 4th, 13th and 22nd are called _kṣemya_ (causing prosperity), the 5th, 14th and 23rd are called _'pratvara (pratyari?)'_, 6th, 15th and 24th constitute (the group called) _sādhaka_ ( that accomplish), the 7th, 16th and 25th are called _naidhana_ (relating to death), the 8th, 17th and 26th are _maitra_ (friendly ), the 9th, 18th and 27th constitute a highly friendly group. These are nine groups (each made up of three nakṣatras from among 27 nakṣatras and each one in each group being separated by the number 9 from the next in the same group). These names make a further approach to the scheme of twelve _bhāvas_ [^773] viz. _janma_ (which corresponds in name and import to _tanu or lagna_), _sampat_ (corresponds to the 2nd bhāva called _dhana_), _karma_(is same as 10th bhāva), _naidhana_ (corresponds to 8th bhāva called vināśa or mṛtyu), _maitra_ (corresponds to the 4th bhāva called _suhṛt_), _kṣemya_ (corresponds to the name of the 11th bhāva called āya or lābha). The Ātharvaṇa-jyotiṣa then provides at some length what should be done or not done on these nine groups and their constituents. The above mentioned words (vipatkara, kṣemya &c.) occur also in Bṛhad-yogayātrā (folio 5 b, IV, 17), in Viṣṇudharmottara II. 166 at end and in the Tantrika work Śāradātilaka [^774].

[^772]: जन्मसम्पद्विपक्षेभ्यः (द्विपत्क्षेभ्यः ?) प्रत्वरः साधकस्तथा ॥ नैधनो मित्रवर्गश्च परमो मैत्र एव तु॥ आथर्वणज्योतिष, नक्षत्र प्रकरण, verse 4: it appears that these very names are mentioned in स्वरोदय quoted by शुद्धिकौमुदी p.203 'जन्मसम्पद्विपत्क्षेम प्रत्यरिः साधको वधः । मैत्रं परममैत्रं च जन्मादीनि पुनः पुनः ॥ प्रत्वरः appears to be a misreading for प्रत्यरिः the आथर्वणज्योतिष (10. 1-11) provides what should be undertaken or avoided on the नक्षत्रs called जन्म, आधान, नैधन &c. The योगयात्रा II. 34 (MS in Bhau Daji Collection Bombay Asiatic Society, II, 35 in Mr. Jagadish Lal's Edition) provides that the king should get himself shaved on every fifth day but he should avoid the nakṣatra of birth and the third, fifth and seventh nakṣatra from that of birth. राज्ञः कार्ये पञ्चमे पञ्चमेह्नि क्षौरर्क्षे पा श्मश्रु तस्योदये वा । त्यक्त्वा ताराः सप्तपञ्चत्रिपूर्वा यात्राकाले नैव कार्ये न युद्धे ॥ योगयात्रा II. 34. उत्पल comments 'सप्तमी तारा नैधनः (or ना?), पञ्चमी प्रत्यहरा (?) तृतीया विपत्करा पूर्वा प्रथमा जन्मतारा । एतास्तारास्त्यक्त्वा विहाय अन्यासु सम्पत्करक्षेमसाधकमैवातिमैत्रासु &c. प्रत्यहरा is probably प्रत्यरि. In मू. चि IV. 12 is जन्मारध्यसम्पद्विपदः क्षेम प्रत्यरि साधकाः । वधमैत्रातिमैत्राः स्युस्तारा नामसदृक्फलाः॥

[^773]: The twelve names of the bhāvas in a horoscope are enumerated in लघुजातक I. 15 as follows: तनु-धन-सहज-सुहृत्-सुत-रिपु-जाया-मृत्यु-धर्म-कर्मायाः । न्यय इति लग्नाद्भावाश्वतुरस्रारण्येऽष्टमंचतुर्थे।

[^774]:  यस्मिन्नक्षत्रे पुरुषस्य जन्म तन्नक्षत्रं तस्मान्नक्षत्राच्च दशमं तत एकोनविंशज्जन्मनक्षत्रमिति विन्द्यात् । तत्र सम्पत्करक्षेमसाधकमैत्रातिमैत्रेषु सर्वाणि कर्माणि कुर्यात् । दशमर्क्षे च। विष्णुधर्मोत्तर II. 166 at end (in prose); जन्मभे(जन्मभ? )कर्माधानोदितस्तु सम्पद्विपत्करक्षेमाः । प्रत्यरिसाधकवैनाशिकाश्च मित्रातिमित्रे च ॥ बृहद्योगयात्रा folio 5b, IV. 17; जन्मसम्पद्विपत्क्षेम प्रत्यरिः साधको वधः। मित्रं परममित्रं च जन्मादीनि पुनः पुनः॥ शारदा' II. 125-126.

It should be noted that the Ātharvaṇa-jyotiṣa gives at least five names that are the same as the corresponding bhāvas in extant _Jātaka_ works. It is difficult to state the date when the extant Ātharvaṇa jyotiṣa might have been composed. It mentions week-days but does not enumerate the twelve zodiacal signs, it refers to the doctrine of Bhṛgu (9.1.). Verses 1-4 of Ātharvana jyotiṣa (chapter 13 ) are the same as Manu III. 46-49; similarly, Ātharvaṇa jyotiṣa 12. 8-9 are almost the same as Manu IV. 41-42. It is quite possible that the present text is a recast of an older work. In any case the present text of the Ātharvaṇa jyotiṣa cannot be placed earlier than the 2nd or 1st century B.C, and may be a little later still. But it appears that the present Ātharvaṇa jyotiṣa only collects together the ideas then current and therefore the five names (janma, sampat, naidhana, mitra and karma) could very well have been current centuries before the present Ātharvaṇa Jyotiṣa text. Similarly, it is difficult to assign an exact date to the Viṣṇu-dharmottarapurāṇa. It is in the nature of an encyclopaedia of the then knowledge of several lores and its present text may be assigned to some period between the 4th and sixth century A. D.

## Nakṣatra Astrology in sūtra works

From the passage of the Bṛhadāraṇyka Upaniṣad (in note [^754]) it would be seen how auspicious times were prescribed for rites to be performed by an individual. The Brāhmaṇas and Kalpasūtras prescribed the auspicious nakṣatras and seasons for solemn Vedic sacrifices. The _gṛhya_ and _dharma_ sūtras prescribed for domestic rites auspicious times, which were either the same or similar to those prescribed in the Brāhmaṇas, Br. Up. and the Kalpasūtras. A few examples may be cited here. The Āśvalāyana (I. 13.1), Āpastamba (VI. 14.9), Baudhāyana (I. 10. 1) and Pāraskara (I. 14) and other gṛhyasūtras provide that the rite of _Puṁsavana_ (that would produce male issue) was to be performed in the third month after conception on Tiṣya (Puṣya) nakṣatra or on a day on which the moon would be in a male nakṣatra.[^774a] The Bhāradvājagr̥hya expressly mentions Tiṣya, Hasta, Anurādhā, Uttarā Bhādrapadā as the proper nakṣatras for puṁsavana. As regards _caula_ (tonsure ) Āpastamba-gr̥hya (VI. 16.3) prescribes that it should be performed in the third year after birth on Punarvasu nakṣatra. The name of the nakṣatra may be noted, which literally means 'fresh wealth or new growth.' The Kauśika-sūtra mentions' pāpanakṣatra' (in 46.25) and puṁnakṣatra (lucky nakṣatra) in 35. 2. There are varying provisions about marriage. The Āp. gr. says that all seasons are proper for marriage, excepting the two months of Śiśira (viz, Māgha and Phālguna) and excepting the last month (Āṣāḍha) of summer, and all nakṣatras declared to be auspicious.[^775] The sutra also quotes an ancient gāthā stating that persons for choosing a girl should be sent out on Invakās (i e. Mṛgaśīrṣa) and then they are greeted with success. As regards marriage the Gobhila-gr̥hya provides a simple rule that it should be performed on an auspicious ( puṇya ) nakṣatra, while the Pāraskara [^776] is more elaborate viz. one should take a maiden's hand in marriage in the northward passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the increasing moon, on an auspicious day and on Uttarā Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā, Uttarāṣādhā, Śravaṇa, Dhaniṣṭhā, Uttara-bhādrapadā, Revati, Aśvini, Svāti, Mṛgaśiras and Rohiṇi nakṣatras. The Baudhāyana-gr̥hya [^777] declares: all months are proper for marriage; some (sages ) say that the months of Aṣāḍha, Māgha and Phālguna are to be avoided; the nakṣatras for marriage are Rohiṇi, Mr̥gaśirsa, UttarāPhalguni and Svāti; while for other auspicious rites the nakṣatras are Punarvasu, Tiṣya, Hasta, Śroṇā (Śravaṇa) and Revati.

[^774a]:  तृतीये गर्भमासे तिष्येणोपोषितायाः ... । आश्च. गृ. I. 13. 1; अथ पुंसवनं ... मासे द्वितीये तृतीये वा यदहः पुंसा नक्षत्रेण चन्द्रमा युज्येत तदहरुपवास्यः । पारस्करगृह्य I. 14: अथ पुंसवनं तृतीये मासि चतुर्थादौ वा तिष्येण वा हस्तेन वा अनुराधैर्वोत्तरैर्वा प्रौष्ठपदैः। भारद्वाजगृह्य I. 21. Vide note 754 for male naksatras.

[^775]: सर्व ऋतवो विवाहस्य शैशिरौ मासौ परिहाप्योत्तमं च नैदाघम् । सर्वाणि पुण्योक्तानि नक्षत्राणि । ...इन्वकाभिः प्रसृज्यन्ते ते वराः प्रतिनन्दिताः। आप. गृ. I. 2. 12-13 and 16. The last is a gāthā quoted by the sūtrakāra as said by the commentator Haradatta. इन्वकाs are the stars resembling an arrow with which Rudra pierced the running Mṛga in the heavens. In the legend the arrow succeeded in piercing the Mṛga.

[^776]: पुण्ये नक्षत्रे दारान् कुर्वीत। गोभिलीयगृह्य II. 1. 1.; उदगयन आपूर्यमाणपक्षे पुण्याहे कुमार्याः पाणिं गृह्णीयात् त्रिषु त्रिषूत्तरादिषु स्वातौ मृगशिरसि रोहिण्यां था। पारस्करगृह्य I. 4.

[^777]: सर्वे मासा विवाहस्य । शुचितपस्तपस्यवर्जमित्येके। रोहिणी मृगशीर्षमुत्सरे फल्गुनी स्वातीति विवाहस्य नक्षत्राणि । पुनर्वसू तिष्यो हस्तः श्रोणा रेवतीत्यन्येषां भूतिकर्मणाम्। बौ. गृ. 1. 1. 18-22.

The Āśvalāyana-gr̥hya generalises the auspicious times for several important _saṁskāras_ as follows:[^778] 'the rites for _caula, upanayana, godāna_ and marriage are to be performed in the northward passage of the sun, in the fortnight of the waxing moon and on an auspicious nakṣatra; some (sages) hold that marriage may be performed at all times'. Āśv. further provides that the maiden after marriage was to observe silence and to begin speaking after seeing the Polestar, Arundhati and the constellation of the Seven Sages. This generalisation is carried further by the Pūrvamımāṁsā-sūtra which provides [^779] 'all ritas in honour of the gods are to be performed in the northward passage of the sun, on a day in the bright half of the month and on an auspicious day'.

It will be seen clearly from the above discussion that an auspicious nakṣatra was the _sine qua non_ in almost all Vedic rites and also in ordinary domestic rites in the times of the Brāhmaṇas and sūtras (several centuries before the Christian era), the tithi was rarely mentioned, the week-day was not mentioned nor the name of any _rāśi_ ( zodiacal sign) nor is there any reference to the planets Jupiter and Venus in most sūtras even when prescribing proper times for upanayana or marriage.

This requirement of finding out an auspicious day or nakṣatra for the celebration of a marriage or other domestic rite or for engaging in any undertaking was said in medieval Sanskrit works to be a search for an auspicious _muhūrta_. It is therefore necessary to hold a discussion on the meaning and history of the word _muhūrta_.

[^778]: उदगयन आपूर्यमाणपक्षे कल्याणे नक्षत्रे चौलकर्मोपनयनगोदानविवाहाः। सार्वकालमेके विवाहम् । आश्व. गृ. I. 4. 1-2. गोदान is the same as Keśānta and was performed in the 16th year for a brāhmaṇa, in 22nd year for a kṣatriya and 24th year for a vaiśya (Manu II. 65, Yaj. I. 36); केशान्तः पुनर्गोदानाख्यं कमे गर्भादारम्य षोडशे वर्षे ब्राह्मणस्य कार्यम्। मिता on या. I. 36; vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 402-405 for details.

[^779]: उदगयनपूर्वपक्षाहःपुण्याहेषु दैवानि स्मृतिरूपान्यार्थदर्शनात् । पूर्वमीमांसासूत्र VI. 8. 23. The आप गृ. I. 1. 1-2 begins 'अथ कर्माण्याचाराद्यानि गृह्यन्ते । उदगयनपूर्वपक्षाहःपुण्याहेषु कार्याणि ।'. It would be noted that आप. गृ. and पूर्वमीमांसासूत्र use the same words for the auspicious times for rites.
