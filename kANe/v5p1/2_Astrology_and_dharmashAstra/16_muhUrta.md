CHAPTER XVI 

Muhurta 

The word 'muhūrta' occurs twice in the Rg. In the dialogue between the rivers and sage Viśvamitra that had come to the confluence of the Sutudri (modern Sutlaj) and the Vipās (modern Beas) occurs the following 780 .for the sake of my words (of your praise) that will be followed by the offering of soma may you, that follow the established order (of nature ), stop from 781 flowing for a short while'. In another place the Rgveda says *the opulent Indra, employing many tricks, often assumes different forms from off his own body, since he, being invoked by mantras addressed to him and upholder of the cosmic order and drinking soma at (usual and even) unusual times, comes thrice from heaven for a short time.' In both these passages 'muhūrta' means a short time, a few moments'. This meaning of muhurta is found in the Sat. Br. I. 8. 3. 17 (tan muhurtain dhārayitvā) and JI. 3. 2. 5 (atha prātaḥ anaśitvā muhūrtam sabhāyām-āsitvāpi) and in classical Sanskrit works like the Raghuvamsa ( V. 58). 

There is another meaning of the word 'muhūrta' in sat. Br. X. 4. 2. 18 and XII. 3. 2.5 where it is said that there are fifteen muhūrtas of the day and fifteen of tbe night (i. e. 30 in ahorālra) and that in a year there are 10800 muhūrtas (30 X 360 782).

Here the word muhurta means 15th part of the day ( i.e. in a general way about two nādikas or ghaṭikās). Rg. x. 189.3 appears 783 to contain a somewhat recondite allusion to thirty parts of the day and night 'by the rays of the sun thirty loca tions of the day (and night) shine forth; a laud is offered to the bird (the sun).' The fifteen names (viz. citra, ketu &c.) of the muhūrtas of the day and 15 muhurtas of the night occur in Tai. Br. II1.784 10. 1. 1-3. The Vedanga-Jyotisa states that two nadikās are equal to a muhurta (verse 7 of Vedanga-Jyotisa of Rg.) and that there is a difference of six muhūrtas ( i. e. 12 ghatıkūs) between the longest and shortest day. 785 Manu I. 64, Kautilya ( quoted in note 681) and several purāpas ( quoted in note 682) state that day and night are together equal to thirty muhurtas Therefore, the second meaning of muhūrta from early Brāhmaṇa times at least was 'a period of two gbaṭikās'. The Kausitaki-upaniṣad speaks of muhurtas called Yeṣtihas. 786 

It appears that some centuries before the Christian era the 15 mubūrtas of the day had received names different from those in the Tai. Br. The Baudhāyana-dharma-sātra (II. 10. 26), 

Manu IV. 92 and Yaj. I. 115 prescribe 787 that a householder should get up from his bed in the Brāhma-muhūrta ( the last half watch of the night). The Brāhmamuhūrta is mentioned in

Fifteen muhūrtas of day

Dronaparva (80.23). In the Raghuvamsa (V. 36) Kalidasa says that Aja was born on the Brāhma muhūrta ( i. . Abhijit of which Brahmā is the presiding deity) and in the Kumāra. sambhava (VII. 6 ) he says that the female relatives of Pārvati decked her in readiness for her marriage on Maitra muhūrta and when the Moon was in Uttarā-Phalguni-nakṣatra. tithi (5th). Besides, in several places auspicious tithis, naksatras and muhurtas are mentioned in general (e. g. Sabhā 2. 15 and 23. 4, Vana 253. 28). The Atharvaṇa Jyotisa (1. 6-11 ) names the 15 muhurtas of the day as noted below. 783 The Mubūrtadarśana (or Vidya-madhaviya) gives almost the same 15 names ( except Gāndharva for Viśyāvasu), inserts Sakra before Vāruña and omits Saumya and states that seven of these are auspicious viz. 789 Abhijit, Vairāja, Sveta, Sāvitra, Maitra, Bala and Vijaya. The Adiparva (123.6) states that Yudhisthira was born when the moon was in the naksatra presided over by Indra (i. e. Jyesthā), on the 8th muhūrta called Abhijit, when the sun was on the meridian by day and on a tithi called pārṇā (here the 5th ). In the Udyogaparva it is stated that a purohita was sent as a dūta of the Pandavas on Puṣya yoga 790 and Jaya muhūrta (here Jaya is probably the same as Vijaya). The Manusmr̥ti says that naming the child should be done on the 10th or 12th day (from birth ) on an auspicious tithi, muhūrta and naksatra. 791 It would be proper to assume that the auspicious muhurtas intended by Manu are the same as the seven mentioned in the Vidyāmādhaviya.

Vāyupurāṇa enumerates the names of the 15 muhurtas in the day somewhat differently and also of the night. 792 The Matsya. purāna (in chap. 22. 2) refers to two muhurtas, Abhijit and Rauhiṇa and mentions eight muhūrtas as auspicious on which to begin the construction of a new house. 793 It also speaks of Kutapa as the 8th mubūrta ( 22. 84 ) and states that Kutapa and the following four muhũrtas are the home of svadhā (i. e. śrāddha must be begun on kutapa and completed before the 12th muhūrta ends). It would be seen from the above that the names of muhūrtas were given at least twice, first in the Tai. Br. and then in the Atharvaṇa Jyotiṣa and the Purāṇas. A further stage was probably reached when their names receded into the background and practically disappeared from such works as those of Varāhamihira and only the names of the deities presid ing over the 30 muhūrtas of day and night remained and the muhūrtas came to be known by the names of the deities. Though Varāhamihira refers to the muhūrtas of day and night in Brhat-samhitā 42. 12 and 98.3, he does not set out their names in that work, but in his Bṛhad-Yogayātrā he sets out the 30 names of the deities presiding over the muhūrtas of day and night as quoted in the note below.794 Varāha remarks: what

It sbould be noted that the verses about tbe Teas of sight in all ( note 792) correspond to these verses of aug. The EAS II. 4 specifies the devatās of the 15 muhurtas of the day and 15 of the night. Alberudi (Sacbau, vol. I. pp. 338-342) discusses at length how mubūrtas may be short or long and gives the dominant deities of the 15 Qubūrtas of the day. 

What should be done on muhurtas of day 

541 

ever has been stated as proper for being done on certain nakṣam tras, may be done on tithis presided over by the deities of those nakṣatras and also on kiraṇas and on mukūrtas; that leads to success as the deity is the same.795 For example, if a certain thing is recommended for being done on Ardra nakṣatra, then it may be done also on the muhūrta of Siva (i. e. the first muhūrta of the day) as the nerału of both (the naksatra Ardra and the first muhurta) is the same (viz. Rudra). The Atharvana Jyotisa ( 2. 1-11 ) and (3. 1-6 ) dilates upon what should be done on the 15 muhurtas of the day. Some examples may be cited here: on Raudra may be done whatever is of a terrific nature; on Maitra should be done whatever is affectionate or friendly; on Sārabhata black magic may be resorted to against enemies; Abhijit is proper for all desired objects and gives success in all undertakings; Vijaya leads to victory if one marches on it, one may perform auspicious acts on it and sūrili rites; on Bhaga muhūrta one should choose a brāhmaṇa maiden for marriage and such a one married on Bhaga does not turn out unchaste. It may be noticed that Patañjali (on Vārtika one on Pāṇini V.1. 80 ) refers to the fact of a person being engaged for a month to teach one muhūrta every day.7% 

After the vernal equinox, days become gradually longer than the night and after the autumnal equinox nights are gradually longer and longer than the day. As there are only thirty muhūrtas from one sunrise to the next sunrise it is proper to say that a muhurta is equal to two ghaṭikās (i. e. 48 minutes). But it is also said that there are 15 muhurtas of the day. The longest day in India of the Vedānga-jyotiṣa locality was of 36 ghaṭikās and therefore if one insisted on the number 15 each muhūrta on that day would be 2 is gbaṭikās, while as the shortest day was 24 ghaṭikās in length each muhūrta of that day would be only 1; ghaṭikās. This difference in length in the case of muhurtas is noted by the Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 73. 6-8) and by the Brahmāndapurāna (I. 2. 21. 122–123). The Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 83. 67-73) sets out the names of the deities of the 30 muhūrtas. It appears that in ancient times it was understood that the long est day gained and was of 18 muhūrtas, while the short night of

that day had only 12 muhūrtas i. e. 6 muhurtas got attached to the day sometimes and 6 muhūtas got attached to the night sometimes when it was longest. Patañjali 797 in his bhāsya on Vārtika 2 of Pāṇini II. 1. 29 mentions this. This would be a matter of personal observation which need not extend beyond a few years. But even here Prof. Neugebauer smells Mesopotamian influence (Exact sciences in Antiquity' p. 178). This is a characteristic example of the jaundiced eyes with which most Western writers look at things Indian. If the writer of the Vedanga Jyotisa was a native of the extreme north west of India or had stayed there for some years he would have easily noticed the difference between the longest day and the short est day as about twelve ghaṭikās, particularly as that very verse of the Vedānga-jyotisa shows that water clocks were then used. Even illiterate people in the villages of Bombay State know that the difference between the longest and shortest day in their villages is about six ghaṭikās (as Bombay is a little over 18 degrees, N. Lat.). There is nothing to show that the writer of the Vedānga-Jyotisa was not a person who was either born in the extreme north-west of India or stayed there. The North-West of India was a centre of Sanskrit culture at least six centuries preceding the Christian era and Taksasilā (Taxila ) was a great University where princes came to learn (vide Rhys Davids in "Buddhist India' p. 8). Panini hailed from that part, it appears, and teaches the formation of words like Saindhava, Tākṣaśila and Sālāturiya as meaning a person whose ancestors lived in or who himself stayed in Sindhu or in Taksasilā or in Salātura ( Pan. IV.3. 89-90 and 93–94). Later writers call Pāṇini Sālāturiya (vide Bhāmaba VI 62-63). To suppose that a learned Indian who was writing a work on Jyotisa had to run all the way from India to Mesopotamia a thousand or more miles for finding out the difference between the longest and shortest day in his own country or for saying that the difference between the longest and shortest day in Mesopotamia being 12 ghaṭikās the same was the difference between them in India or for consulting works written in the Cuneiform characters for that purpose almost borders on the absurd. Besides Prof Neugebauer is not quite correct. The latitude of Babylon is 32'. 40' North and even there the ratio would not be exactly as 3 to 2. Gāndhāra is 31°. 40'

Meaning of 'Muhūrta'

North Lat; one who is to the north of Gāndhāra may quite naturally say that the ratio is about 3 to 2. Vide C. R. C. Report p. 225. Further in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 8 (pp. 6-26), Prof. Waerden points out (at p. 18) that even in Babylonia the great omen series started from the primitive ratio 2:1 and that it was only later that the more accurate value 3:2 became known, 

It has been shown so far that the word 'muhurta' had two meanings in the ancient Vedic times, viz. for a short time' and 'a part equal to two ghaṭikās.' As some muhūrtas of the day (of the duration of two ghaṭikās) were declared to be auspicious, gradually a third meaning came to be attached to this word viz. time that is fit for the performance of an auspicious act°798 It would be shown later on how the medieval Dharmaśāstra works are full of muhūrtas in this sense. 

In order to thoroughly understand the requirements about muhūrta in this third sense some knowledge of the planets, the twelve bhāras ( houses or places in a horoscope ) and the rāśis would be necessary. Before entering on a discus sion of these latter matters reference must be made to the change that came over even the best minds of India from about the 4th century B.C. It has been seen above (p.527) how the star-gazer and the yaṇaka had come to be condemned and how one who was a professional astrologer (for money ) had been looked down upon as an unworthy brāhmaṇa. All the same there was even about 500 or 600 B. C. a small section of people who looked upon the astrologer as all important, particularly to the king. The Gautamadharmasūtra 799 provides the king should choose as his purohita (palace priest) a brāhmaṇa endowed with learning, good family, eloquence, handsomeness, (middle ) age ( neither too young nor too old ), character, and who is righteous in conduct and austere; the king should perform all (religious ) acts as directed by the priest; he should respect (i.e. follow and not discard) what those who have devoted

thought to astrology and the lore of omens and portents apno unce ( as required to be done ), because some ūčūryas (teachers ) assert that the welfare ( of the country or king ) depends upon that (upon doing what astrologers and experts in portents declare ).' This trend of thought gradually gathered greater and greater strength till at last even the great smr̥tikāra 

Yājñavalkya categorically 800 declared in the first centuries of the Christian era “one should sedulously worship that planet that is badly affected (in a person's horoscope ). Brahmā conferred a boon on then (planets) ' when worshipped you should honour the worshipper' (with favours ). The rise and fall of kings is depen dent on the planets, as also the emergence and the disappearance of the world; therefore planets are to be worshipped most". Yājñavalkya no doubt declares 891 that 'success in undertakings is dependent upon daira (luck) and human effort; out of these, daiva is really human effort of previous lives made manifest ( in this life ). Just as a chariot cannot be set in motion on one wheel, so luck does not succeed unless there is human effort ( also )'. Discussion of the relative importance of daiva (luck or destiny) and human effort are frequent in Dharmaśāstra works, particularly in the Mahābhārata, there being three

tendencies viz. (firstly ) daiva is all powerful, ( secondly ) human effort is superior, (thirdly ) a golden mean between the two. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 168–169 for discussion and for passages supporting all the three views. The first chapter of Brhad yogayātrā ( 20 verses ) and also of the Yogayātrā ( 22 verses ) deal with daiva (Luck, Fate) and puruṣakāra. In spite of this, from the king to the lowliest man, almost everyone was firmly in the grip of astrology and even now astrology has great influence over some highly educated Indians. Astrology based on horoscopes and dealing with individuals was called horāśāstra or jātaka. By the time of Varāhamihira even learned men had forgotten the origin of the word horū. The Bșhajjātaka sayg 802 'according to some the word horā is obtained from ahorātra by dropping the first and last syllables, that horāśāstra well manifests what the fruition of acts, good or bad, done in previous lives is going to be'. It should be noticed that the Brhajjātaka insists on two matters, viz. (1) it links up the horoscopic astrology to the doctrines of karma and punarjanma (re-incarnation to wipe out karma) and (2) the śāstra holds that the horoscope to be only a map or plan, which indicates future trends in a man's life arising from what he had done in a previous life or in previous lives. It does not here say that the planets in a man's horoscope will compel him to do this or that, but it says that the horoscope will only intimate in what directions a man's future might be evolved. These principles were repeated even by late medieval writers. For example, Raghunandana 803 in his Udvāhatattva (p. 125 ) agrees with the Dipikā that the planets only convey that sins were committed in former lives, but they do not them selves produce evil results and quotes the Matsyapurāṇa jn support that 'evil actions done in former lives bear fruit in the present life in the form of diseases, distress and the death of those dear to one'. There was probably a third underlying principle viz. the stars are the temples in which the gods reside,

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

as said in the Sat. Br. and Tai. Br. 804 The Babylonians 805 and Assyrians based their astrology mainly on three assumptions viz. (1) the stars are temples in which the gods reside; (2) the stars reveal to men the intentions of the gods with regard to the future; (3) human history is predetermined at a heavenly council over which Marduk presides. These, except the first, are entirely different from the principles emphasized by Varāha. mihira and those who came after him. The Babylonians and Greeks had no (generally believed) doctrines of karma and punar janma. Therefore, they could not make astrology serye indirectly a higher purpose, viz, of inducing people to lead a life of virtue in the present. Instead of the somewhat childish and often immoral legends of ancient times the cult of planetary influence and worship seemed to many minds far more rational and con vincing. 

The Sārāvali of Kalyāna-varman follows this and adds 806 that what is known among the people as Jātaka is called horā in this sāstra or the word (horā) may indeed be taken to be & synonym for 'consideration of what the destiny would be'. The word 'horā' has two other meanings in Sanskrit astrology viz. lagna ( that sign which is rising on the eastern horizon at a particular moment) and half a rāśi (Brhajjātaka I, 9). Extravagant claims were made for the importance and utility of astrology and astrologers. The Sārāvali declares : 807 there is no one else except astrology that would serve as a helper of men in acquiring wealth, as a boat in the sea of calamities and as a councillor when one starts on a journey or invasion. Varāha mihira boasts Sos . Even those who have resorted to a forest (i. e.

who have become forest hermits), who are free from worldly attachments and are without property, ask questions of one who knows the movements of heavenly luminaries. As the night without a lamp or the sky without the sun, so a king without an astrologer (with him) wanders about (or wavers ) as a blind man on a road. If there be no astronomer and astrologer, auspicious times, tithis, nakṣatras, seasons and the ayanas (northward and southward passages of the sun ),-these would all become confused. What a single astrologer knowing the country and time can effect, that even a thousand elephants or four thousand horsemen cannot accomplish.' 

The Rājamārtaṇḍa provides 809 'the purohita (family or palace priest ), an astronomer, a councillor and an astrologer as the fourth – these must always be supported by the king even with great trouble, as in the case of women.' 

It has, however to be noted that Varāhamibira himself frequently gives up the principle that the horoscope is only a map showing tendencies and talks the language of certainty and of the planets causing this or that state of things. To mention one or two examples. In Bṛhaj-jātaka 810 he says the sages declare that a person is born from a paramour for certain (and not from his reputed father ) if in his horoscope Jupiter has no dȚsṭi ( aspect) either on the lagna or on the moon or on the sun and moon that are in conjunction (in his horoscope ) or when the moon is in conjunction with the sun and with a malefic planet (Mars or Saturn)'.

ction with a malefic planet in the 1st, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th or 12th house ( in a horoscope ) causes death ( of the new-born child ) if it is not also in conjunction with powerful Venus, or Mercury or Jupiter or if it is not in aspect with one of those powerful three.' Again in Brhaj-jātaka XIV. 1 it is said: If the sun is in con junction with another planet, he produces the following results, viz, with the moon a man who makes (lethal) machines or works in stones; with Mars a man addicted to evil ways; with Mercury a man who is skilful, intelligent, famous and happy; with Jupiter, a cruel man or one intent on carrying out the objects of others; with Venus a man who makes money by going on the stage ( or in a ring for boxing &c.) or by the use of arms; with Saturn a man clever in metals or different kinds of (merchan dise or) vessels. The Sārāvali very frequently says that such and such a position produces (janaijati, utpādayati ) or causes ( karoti or kuryāt &c.) certain results. Vide chap. 33. 48–61. 

Before proceeding further I must point out that India was not singular in its firm belief in Astrology. The case was the same throughout Europe and among the Greeks after Alexander the Great. It has been already seen (p.521) how Babylonian astrologers made reports to the king about the position of the Sun, the Moon and the planets and what they portended for the country, the king and the people. Vide for example, Nos. 9, 15, 16, 21, 32, 33, 52, 53, 63, 66, 67, 72, 74, 76, 86, 151, 164 from The Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon' by R. Campbell Thompson (vol. I and II, Luzac and Co. London, 1900), But horoscopic astrology was developed by them later. In the Old Testament Isaiah (759–710 B. C. ) 47.1 and 5 apostrophize Babylon as the daughter of the Chaldeans and in verse 13 we read * let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly prognos ticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee'. In Daniel 4.7 it is said that on Nebuchadnezzar's order 'came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans and the soothsayers. Vide also Daniel 1.20 and 2.2 and 27. The Chaldeans held that the five planets specially controlled men's destinies and five Babylonian deities were identified with them. As Bouchem Leclercq observes (in'L'Astrologie Grecque', p. 572 ) 'Chaldean astrology had lived on a fund of naive ideas, it began at a time 

(Continued from last page) from Sārāvali X. 98 that the Moon must be ksina (waning, i, e, from 8th of dark half to the 8th of the following fortnight) for the application of this rule. 

Chaldeans and Greek Science

when the heavens were deemed to be nothing but a cover of the earth, when all the stars were ranged at small distances on the vault and the planets were supposed to move in the midst of stars like shepherds inspecting their flocks. Greek science having ext ended the world, the influence of stars moved back at enormous distances was not a postulate of common sense' (vido note 748 above ). Herodotus 812 ( II. 82) refers to a peculiar practice of the Egyptians to regard each month and day as sacred to some deity, and says how from the day of a man's birth they determined his fortune, character and the manner of his death. But this has no reference to horoscopic Astrology. The Egyptians knew nothing about the Zodiac before the Alexandrian age. There is no trace of astrology in early Groek astronomical writers and it appears that the Greeks got it from Babylon 813 after Alexander conquered Babylon, when teachers of astrology began to arrive in Greece. The Hellenistic mind was soon completely captivated by astro logy. Before the advent of astrology the Greeks tried to peep into the future by oracles, interpretation of dreams and inspec. tion of the entrails and livers of sacrificed animals, from the flight and cries of birds and from prodigies and unusual occurrences such as eclipses, comets and meteors. Berossus 814, a priest of the god Bel at Babylon, dedicated to his patron Antiochus I Soter (280-261 B. C.) an elaborate work on Baby lonian and Chaldean history and it was he who was instrumental in spreading Babylonian astrology in Greece by first introducing it in his school at Cos, an island not far from the south-western corner of Asia Minor. From Greece astrology spread to Rome about the 2nd century B. C. The signs of the Zodiac became house-hold words in Greece and Rome. Stoics like Posidonius

In the same journal at p. 15 he does not know how horoscopic astrology in Greece originated from the totally different omen type astrology of the preceding millenium,

helped it by defending it. Cato in 815 his work on agriculture warns a farmer against consulting a Chaldean and in 139 B. O. an Edict was passed for expelling Chaldeans from Italy. Diodorus 816 Siculus (a contemporary of Augustus of Rome ) describes the theory and method of the Chaldeans in casting horoscopes. Horace 817 ( died in 8 B, C.) in his ode to Maecenas refers to the influence of the signs Libra, Scorpion and Capricornus and of the protective power of Jove and about bale ful Saturn in his horoscope. Strabo, 818 who died in 24 A. D., averred (XVI. 1.6) that some Chaldeans were skilled in astro nomy and the casting of horoscopes. Petronius (1st century A. D.) describes in his novel Satyricon a dinner in forty pages in which a tray displayed the signs of the zodiac under each of which was placed appropriate food ( vide Will Durant in “Caesar and Christ" page 298, (New York 1944). Juvenal,819 who flourished about the close of the 1st century A. D., strongly inveighs against ladies who have great confidence in Chaldean astrology. It should not, however, be supposed that no dissenting voice was raised against astrology in Rome and medieval Europe, Cicero did not believe in astrology 820 as he said that the planets were too far away (Bouché Leclerq's work p. 572). St. Augustine (354-430 A. D.) in his work 'City of God' calls astrology a delusion.821 There were some points of difference between Baby lonian astrology and Greek astrology, viz. Babylonian astrology originally at least was interested in the State and the royal family, while Greek astrology was interested only in the indi

vidual and Babylonian astrology was a priestly business while in Greece the astrologers were laymen, Astrology became a study of international importance in Europe and was cultivated in the Universities as a subject of real value throughout Europe by the side of astronomy. Its great vogue among even well educated people was due to its apparent scientific structure with its houses, planets, twelve signs and so forth. Allen (in 'Star-crossed Renaissance' Preface p. VIII) says that everybody in the Renaissance period in the West believed to, some extent in astrology. In 'Stars above us' by Prof. E. Zinner, Tycho Brahe is quoted as saying that he prepared every year an astrological forecast for his king (p. 76). Even Copernicus, Galileo and Kepler practised astrology themselves or countenanced its practice. Bacon was prepared to say that there was no fatal necessity in the stars, but they rather incline than compel. Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos reigned supreme for about 1400 years and is even now a work of great authority for those who believe in astrology. It may interest the reader to know that the great German poet, dramatist and philosopher, Goethe 822 (1749-1832), begins his Memoirs by mentioning the aspects of planets at his birth. 

Two circumstances tended to weaken the influence of astro logy in Europe, viz. the giving up of the geocentric theory in favour of the heliocentric theory and the vast additions to astronomical knowledge made during the last two centuries. But it should not be supposed that astrology has become defunct in the West or U. S. A. The immense strain and distress caused by the two world wars provided a powerful fillip for the spread and influence of astrology. Even in papers the circulation of which runs into millions there is a regular astrological feature every day or every week, which tells people what the stars portend for twelve groups of the world's population in the week

The aspects of Jupiter and Venus were favourable to the day. Mercury testified no signs of hostility ; Saturn and Mars were aeutral. The Moon, however, the near the full, was an important obstacle; and the more so as the labour which attended my birth coincided with the hour of her new phase. She retarded my entrance into the world antil the moment had elapsed'. Vide 'Stars above us' by Prof. Zinner p. 68 for Goethe's horoscope.

or on the day mentioned. 823 What benefit the people derive from these prognostications it is difficult to understand. Often the prognostications are extremely vague and not of greater extent than three or four short cryptic sentences. There must be millions of people in each of the twelve groups (such as those born from 23rd September to October 23rd, those born from 24th October to 22nd November and so on). It is said that in U.S.A. alone there are about 25000 registered astrologers. 

Those interested in astrology in general and Greek astrology in particular and those who desire to know how astrology is regarded by many modern scientific minds may read 'L'Astro logie Grecque' by A. Bouchè-Leclercq '(1899, a masterly work in French on Greek Astrology ) pp. 570-593 (for arguments against astrology ); The Royal Art of Astrology 'by Robert 

Eisler (London, 1946), which contains a reasoned and 

· sustained refutation, and Mr. J. C. Gregory's Article on 'Ancient Astrology 'in Nature, vol. 153 pp. 512-515 ( a brief, but instructive and detached survey of astrology from Chaldean times to this day ). The number of books in favour of astro logy or expounding it is large and I do not propose to mention them. One book arrested my attention, viz. Louis de Wohl's Secret service of the sky. On p. 31 ho propounds a doctrine very similar to what Varāha-mihira laid down as the scope of horāśāstra viz. that Astrology has nothing whatso over to do with mere predictions, that it only indicates tenden cies and that human will is free. He began well, but he did not observe his own precepts. On p. 235 he predicts 'I do not be lieve that Mahatma Gandhi will survive the first half of 1939.' This prediction turned out to be untrue and it is well-known that Mahatma Gandhi was killed on the 30th of January 1948. 

The English language itself bears witness to the great influ ence of astrology in England; e. g. such words and expressions as 'ill-starred expedition', 'disastrous consequences', tempera ments being either jovial, mercurial, or saturpine, 'moon–32*

struck (mad) lover'. The word influence (from fluo to flow) itself is due to astrological beliefs and words like aspect', 

conjunction', 'ascendant', 'retrograde' are all due to the language of astrology. 

In support of Astrology Ptolemy (in Tetrabiblos, 1.2) puts forward certain arguments. The Sun not only affects every thing on the earth by the change of season, but by its daily revolutions furnishes heat, moisture, dryness and cold in regular order. The Moon, the nearest heavenly body to the earth, causes the seas to change their tides with its own rising and setting times, and plants and animals wholly or partly wax and wane with the moon. The planets often signify hot, windy and snowy conditions of the air and affect mundane things. The changes of seasons and winds are understood even by very ignorant mon and by some dumb animals. Sailors know the special signs of storms and winds that arise periodically by reason of the aspects of the sun, moon and planets. But because sometimes sailors err, no one says that there is no science of navigation. Therefore, a sufficiently observant man wise enough to know accurately the movements of the sun, moon and planets can predict whether the weather will be warmer or 825 wetter. Why can he not, with respect to an individual, perceive the general quality of his temperament from the surroundings at the time of his birth, as for example that he would be such and such in body and mind? Ptolemy then condemns impostors who do not study the science but deceive common and trusting people and fill their pockets. He further points out that the nativity alone is not the sole basis of judging a person's future, that the country of birth, the 

(Continued from last page) living things' by Prof. George Sarton in Isis vol. 30 (1939) pp. 495-507, where he examines the beliefs about the Moon's connection with lunacy, fides, menstruation, terrestrial magnetism, says that these are matters for experiment, advises scientists to keep an open mind and holds that lagar lofuence is unproved as to some of them. 

825. A short passage from Bouche-Leclercq (p. 574) may be set out here : how to justify the ridiculous associations of ideas attached to the purely imaginary forms of the figures of the Zodiac and the reciprocal lafuence of planets on the signs and of the signs on the planets when these are (one knows this since a long time) at a great distance from the con Mellations and do not appear to be placed there except by the effect of perspective'?

race to which he belongs, the customs of the people among whom he is born, the way in which he is reared, the age in which he lives have also to be considered, all which will contri buto materially to the proper prediction, other things being equal. In IV.10 he points out that if one looks only at the horoscope without paying attention to nationality, manners and customs and the like he may call an Ethiopian fair 8250 of complexion and having straight hair and a German a dark skinned person and endowed with woolly hair or not knowing the peculiar customs say that an Italian whose horoscope is being examined may marry his sister (as ancient Egyptians did) or that the man may marry his mother (as only Persians did ). Vide Tetrabiblos IV. 10 p. 439 (Loeb. cl. Library). In I. 3 Ptolemy argues that astrology is not only possible but is beneficial, because fore-warned is fore-armed. It is a very far cry to argue from the undoubted influence of the Sun and the Moon on mundane matters, such as heat and cold, rains, storms and droughts that the particular positions and aspects of the Sun, Moon and planets at the time of birth or conception ( as some hold ) are throughout an individual's life ( it may be for a day or a hundred years ) the dominating factor (if not the sole factor as many astrologers say ) governing his conduct, character, family affairs and destiny. The reasoning of Ptolemy, though very cleverly put and though with a slight scientific appearance, is rather vague and not at all cogent or convincing. He distin guishes between universal or general astrology (treated of in Books I-II ) which relates to whole countries, races, cities and large bodies of men and particular or genethlialogical astrology treated of in books III-IV. 

825 a. Utpala on Lagbajātaka IV. 1 states similarly that one (the astro loger ) should specify the form (or appearance) of a person after knowing bls caste, since svapākas ( cāndalas) and Disādas are dark-skinned by caste; similarly, he should consider in what family, whether of fair persons or dark persons, the person (whose horoscope is being examined ) was born or in what country, since all people from Karnātaka are dark, people from Videba (i. e, Mithilā, part of present Bihar State) are dark-browo aod from Kashmir fair.

Astrologers to consider country, caste, family 

555 

· Indian works also require the astrologer to consider the customs of the country and of the people. The Rājamārtaṇḍa 8256 says. First the usages of people must be considered; whatever is firmly established in the several countries, that alone must be followed; the learned give up what is hateful to the people ; therefore an astrologer should proceed along the people's way. A learned man should never go against the inclinations of the family (to which the person belongs ) and of the country'; and then he gives examples of the astrological requirements as regards planets in the case of marriages in several countries. The general astrology about calamities or occurrences that affect all people spoken of by Ptolemy would fall under sakhā or Samhitā in the narrower sense ( vide notes 688 and 690). Some important and interesting conclusions of Ptolemy may be noted here. 

Ptolemy speaks of beneficent and malefic planets (1.5), of masculine and feminine planets (1.6 ), of diurnal and noctu. rnal (in Sanskrit dinabali and niśābali ) planets (I. 7), (I. 12 ) masculine and feminine rāśis ( signs ), the aspects of the signs (I. 13 ) viz. opposition ( 180 degrees), trine (120°), quartile (90°) and sextile (60°), of the houses ( svagthas in Sanskrit ) of the planets. In Book II he divides the inhabited world into quarters equal in number to the triangular formations of the signs of the zodiac and after a disquisition which would be regarded by modern men as casuistical and practically unintel ligible, Ptolemy sets forth a list of over seventy countries ( then known), assigning to each sign some countries. For example, to Aries he assigns Britain, Gaul, Germania, Bastarnia, Syria, Palestine, Judaea and one more; to Capricorn he assigns India, Ariana, Gedrosia, Thraco, Macedonia, Illyria. The whole of America, almost the whole of Africa (except the northern part), Indonesia and Australia and the other neighbouring lands are not considered by Ptolemy at all, because these were unknown then. He remarks at the end of II. 3 that as to metropolitan cities they should be treated like individuals and their nativity is to be cast by taking the time of the foundation 826 of the city

A few important points of agreement and disagreement between Sanskrit astrological works and Ptolemy will be set out later on. 

The literature on muhūrta ( auspicious time for undertaking anything ) is extensive. Almost all works on Kāla mentioned above such as Hemādri on Kāla, the Kāla-madhava, Kalatattva Vivecana, Nirṇayasindhu are in a way works on muhūrta, since they discuss the proper times for performing the samskāras and religious rites. Among the works the names of which begin with the word muhūsta are: Muhūrtakalpadruma (published by Nirn.

Press, 1925); Muhūrtamālā by Raghunatha (mg. in Bhau Daji collection); Muhūrta-muktāvali (incomplete ms. with only 45 verses in the same collection). Out of these, three works alone are now available in print viz. Muhūrta darśana, Muhurta-cintāmaṇi and Muhūrta-mārtaṇḍa. The rest are mss. ( in Bombay Asiatic Society's Library). In this section on muhūrtas reliance has been placed mainly on the three printed works along with the Jyotisaratnamālā of Sripati (about 1039 A. D.), the Rājamārtaṇḍa of Bhoja (ms in B. O. R. I., Poona) and the other works on Kāla. Among the works described as especially dealing with muhūrtas, the most elabo rate are the Muhūrta-cintānani (containing about 480 verses with a very exhaustive commentary) and the Muhūrtadarsana (with about 600 verses) and also a very elaborate commentary. It would not be possible to deal with all matters contained in these works. The Muhūrtamārtapda (containing 161 verses) follows a middle course. According to it the subjects dealt with in it are briefly as follows:--what positions and aspects of the planets, what yogas, what tithis, naksatras, months and conditions of the family and of the mind should be avoided in the case of śubha ( auspicious ) actions; the proper times for samskāras, such as garbhādhāna, pussavana, jātakarma, piercing the infant's ear, caula, upanayana, the end of the period of Vedic study; topics connected with marriage (this takes up 55 Vorses i. e. a little over one-third of the entire work); times for kindling sacred domestic fire (gļhyāgni); times for construction of a house and for first entrance into it; the proper times for starting on a journey or marching against an enemy king; auspicious and inauspicious sakunas (omens or prognostications); times for king's coronation, for wearing of rich clothes and ornaments and for agricultural operations, for sale and purchase of animals (such as cattle, horses ), for bath with sesame and myrobalan, for finding lost articles, for constructing wells and tanks: times when Vedic study should be stopped (anadhyāya ) for long or temporarily; the results of a lizard or chameleon falling on one's body; what planet is inaugpicious or auspicious in which sign from the sign of one's birth; the puṇyakāls of 

558 





Saṅkrāntis. It may be mentioned that many of the provisions about auspicious aspects of planets, about upanayana and marriage, construction of and first entrance into a house, sakunas about the fall of lizards and chameleons were observed in the author's boyhood and are still observed by many, though there is gradually an increasing looseness of observance in these matters. 

It should be noted that even as to sakunas Varāba-mihira puts forward the principle that it is the fruition of actions, good or evil, done in previous lives by men, that is manifested by sakunas for those who start on a journey or invasion, 827 

How people had become almost crazy with the idea of find ing out a muhūrta for everything from shaving, wearing a new garment to such solemn matters as marriage is well illustrated by the provision of a muhūrta for a theft in the Muhūrta muktāvali, viz. the act of thieving succeeds when done on the naksatras Āśleṣā, Mrgaśiras, Bharaṇī, Svāti, Dhanisthā, Citra and Anurādhā, on a Saturday or a Tuesday and on a riktā tithi ( 4th, 9th and 14th ). 828 

Before entering on a discussion about individual acts or rites, it is necessary, in order that the reader may understand the prescriptions about muhūrtas, to explain some simple details of Jātaka. To discuss in detail all the details of Jātaka works is much beyond the scope of this work and would necessitate the writing of a volume by itself. A middle course has to be followed. Besides naksatras, their lords and their classifications, one has to bear in mind the rāśis, the planets and the bhāvas (houses or places) in a horoscope. For these reliance will be mainly placed on the Bșhatsamhita and Bșhaj-jātaka of Varāhamihira, the Sārāvali, Jyotisaratnamālā of Sripati, the Rājamārtaṇḍa, Jātakālankara of Gaṇośa ( composed in sake 1535, 1613-4 A. D.). The 27 or 28 naksatras and their presiding deities have already been enumerated above ( pp. 499-504 and note 731 ). It has to be remembered that the dovatā of a nakṣatra is often employed to indicate the naksatra or the tithi itself also. Here the classifica tion of nakṣatras will be first discussed.

Classification of nakṣatras 

359 

Brhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad quoted above (in note 754 ), it is clear that the nakṣatras had very early (i. e. about 1000 B.C. at least) been classified as punya ( auspicious ) and pāpa (inauspicious ) and into male and female. The Vedāngajyotisa ( Yājuṣa ) gives a classification of nakṣatras into ugra and krūra, 829 The naksatras are further classified in the Brhat-sambitā (chap. 97. 6-11) into dhruva ( or sthira = fixed), tiksna (or dāruṇa), ugra (or krūra ), ksipra ( or laghu ), mrdu (or maitra), mrdutikspa (or sādhāraṇa or misra), cara ( or cala ). 830 

The Br. S. (97. 6-11 ) states that on Dhruva nakṣatras the coronation of a king, śānti ( propitiatory rite for averting impen ding evil or calamity ), planting of trees, foundation of a city, charitable acts, sowing seeds, and other permanent acts should be done; on tiksna nakṣatras succeed attempts to harm, the acquisition of mantra (mystic verse or formula ), raising ghosts, arrest (of a person), beating, separating (two friends or) relation ships; ugra nakṣatras are to be used for success in extermination, destruction of another's property, cheating, arrest, poisoning, incendiarism, striking with a weapon, killing; kṣipra (or laghu) nakṣatras are declared as leading to success in sales, in making love, in the acquisition of knowledge, decoration, arts, crafts (such as carpentry), medicines, journeys; the mṛdu naksatras are beneficial in securing friends, sexual affairs, clothes, orna ments, auspicious ceremonies (marriage, upanayana &c.) and singing; the mrdu-tikṣpa (or sādhāraña) naksatras produce mixed results ( on which mild or fierce acts may be done); the cara naksatras are beneficial in doing fleeting actions. The Muhūrta-mārtapda provides that wise mon engage in actions similar to the names of the groups of naksatras for attaining success. It should be noticed that some works like the Jyotisa ratnamālā (III. 9 ) and the Muhūrta-cintāmaṇi (II. 2-8) hold that Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday are respectively dhruva, cara, ugra, miśra, laghu, mrdu, and tīkṣpa and that actions that are appropriate for nakṣatras of those groups are appropriately performed on the respective week days. 831 

The Bșhaj-jātaka devotes fourteen verses for the characteri stics of persons born on the 27 nakṣatras from Asvinl. Two

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

Verses are translated for sample : 832 a person born on Asyinis is fond of ornaments, is handsome, has a prepossessing appear ance, is clever (in all things ) and intelligent; one born on Bharaṇis is of firm resolve, truthful, free from disease, clever and free from worry; one born on Kṛttikās is a heavy eater, fond of other's wives, impatient, famous; one born on Rohiṇi is truthful, pure, of agreeable speech, of resolute intellect and is handsome. The Rājamārtaṇḍa in verses 16-40 sets out the synonyms of 27 naksatras which include the names of the lords of the nakṣatras and synonyms of the lords of nakṣatras. The Jyotiṣaratnamālā, Bhujabala and M. C. 2. 22–23 divide 28 naksatras (including Abhijit ) into four groups 833 of seven each, called' andhaksa' (blind), 'mandākṣa' (of dim sight), 'madhyākṣa' (of medium sight) and 'svaksa' (of good sight) and state that property stolen on 'andhākṣa' naksatras may be recove red quickly, stolen on 'mandākṣa' naksatras after effort, stolen on 'madhyākṣa' (there is no recovery but) the owner may hear that it has been taken to a distant place by the thief; stolen on 'svakṣa' or "sulocana' the owner would not recover it nor even hear about its whereabouts. The Bphat-samhita (chap. 14) has already been referred to (on p. 530) in connection with the provinces of India governed by nine groups of nakṣatras (three nakgatras in each group) and chapter 15 of the same (1-27) sets out what substances are governed by the 27 nakṣatras from Krttikā to Bharapi.834 One verse is translated as a specimen: under Kṛttikās are white flowers, those who have consecrated the Vedic fires, those who know Vedic mantras, sūtras and bhāṣyas (commentaries), officers over mines (or stores), barbers, brāhmaṇas, purohita, astrologers, potters. 

The Brhat-sambitā (104.1-5) declares what naksatras (out of 27) form part of Time looked upon as a puruṣa (Person). This is

Nakṣatrus as limbs of Prajāpati 

561 

an extension of a very old conception. The Tai. Br. says: *Prajāpati has Hasta-naksatra as his hand, Citrā as his head, Nistyā (i. e. Svāti) as his heart, the two stars of Viśākhā as the thighs, Anurādhās as his stability (or support). This is indeed Prajāpati in the form of groups of naksatras ' 835 

From the above it would be noticed that a naksatra astro logy apart from the rāśi astrology had been thoroughly developed in India while Ptolemy is hardly concerned with the naksatras, but concentrates only on rūśis. 

The twelve rūśis are to be found in the Zodiacal belt (or circle ); each extends over 21 naksatras i. e. Mesa extends over Aśvini, Bharani and of Kritikā, Vșsabha extends over of Kṛttikā, whole of Rohiṇi and half of Mrgasirṣa and so on. These twelve rāśis from Mesa are identified respectively with the following limbs of the Kālapuruṣa 354 viz. the head (Mesa), mouth (Vrsabha), chest, heart, stomach, waist, the abdomen (between the navel and the private parts), the private parts, the pair of thighs, the pair of knees, the two shanks, the two feet. Varāha adds that the words rāśi, kṣetra, gȚha, ṣkṣa, bha and bhavanu are used as synonyms in Jātaka. The purpose of the identification of rāśis with the limbs of Kāla put forward by astrological works is that if a malefic planet occupies in a person's horoscope a certain rāśi, he is adversely affected in that limb of his body to which the rāśi corresponds among the limbs of Kāla, but if a beneficent planet occupies at birth a rāsi, then the person prospers as to the corresponding limb. This is succintly put by the Sārāvali (III. 5-6). The twelve rāśis with

Names of rāśis and their synonyms

F 

VU 

It should be noted that the list of synonyms is not exhaustive; other words with the same meaning are often employed. For example, for Simha, Mrgarāja may be used or for Mina the word prthuroman may be used. The words in italics are deemed by Weber and many others as borrowings from or Sanskrit adapta tions of Greek words. It may be admitted that most of them bear a striking resemblance to Greek names of rūśis. Pathona should be Pāthena to correspond with the Greek word. There is no reason why kulira should be regarded as a Greek word. Kern (preface to Br. S. p. 29 ) thinks that it is a pure Sanskrit word. There is no Greek word corresponding to Kulira in Ptolemy. The word Karka or Karkin appears to mean'white' and occurs as early as in Atharvaveda IV.38. 6-7. All that the Bshaj-jātāka (1.8) means is that there are other words like kriya used for the twelve rāsis in other works. Varāhamihira frequently refers to the views of the Yavanas and sometimes differs from them. It has been shown by me in my paper on Yavaneśvara and Utpala'( in J. of Bombay Asiatic Society, vol. 30, pp. 1-8) that there is a Sanskrit work on astrology called Yavana-jātaka of about 4000 verses composed by a king of the Yavanas called Sphujidhvaja and another Vrddhayavanajātaka also in several thousand verses by Minarāja who styles himself the overlord of Yavanas. I cannot agree with Prof. Sen-Gupta ('Anoient Indian Chronology' p. 99 ) that words like Mesa and Vrsabha in verses like Rg. I. 51.1 (abhi tyam mesam) refer to rāśis, when he himself had to concede that he could not find the other ton in the Rg. 

(Continued from last page) kara says that the last rāśi is called 'cettba. (vide Subrahmanya Sastri's translation of Bṛhajjātaka p. 8). The T.S.S. edition of Lewma bas G UIA: FAŞI:' i. e. the last rāśi is called .irthasi'. The Latesia bas इत्यसि संज्ञाभिः क्रियलेयजूकजतुमाः कौर्पिः कुलीरस्तथा हृद्रोगेत्थसितौक्षिकाश्च कथिताः TUT T G: 1 1.9. Ptolemy employs a Greek word for Pisces (Loeb Classical Library pp. 52, 314, 328 &c. ), to wbich 'ittha' or 'ikthasi' or 'irtbasi' would correspond rather than cettba', The Sāravali (I11. 7) reads H Friluokater Targuty :. That shows that it bad oo Greek word for 'mina ' before it. It may be ooted that the Sārāvali expressly says that is Varāha's work is brief it ( Sārāvali) took essential matters from the exten sive sāstras composed by Yavapaparendra and others I have not been able to find the word ittha or a similar Sanskrit adaptation for Mina in the Brbajjātaka.

History of Dharmuśāstra 



TIT 

The appearance of the rāśis is briefly described by the Brbajjātaka 837 1. 5 and explained by Utpala as follows: (Tbe sign Mina i. e. Pisces ) appears as two fishes (each facing the tail of the other), Kumbha appears as a man carrying an empty jar placed on his shoulder, the sign of Gemini is represented as a man carrying a mace and a woman holding a lute, the sign of Sagittarius is a man with a bow whose legs are like those of a horse, the sign Capricorn is a crocodile with the face of a deer, sign of Libra is a person holding scales, the sign Virgo is represented by a maidon in a boat with an ear of corn in one hand and fire in the other; the remaining signs are similar (in form ) to the objects indicated by their names and all signs reside in places appropriate to their names. For more detailed descrip. tions, vide the twelve verses quoted from Yavaneśvara by Utpala which I have quoted and translated in my paper in the Journal of the Bombay Asiatic Society vol. 30 parts 1 and 2 pp. 1-7 and which are found in the Yavana-jātaka of Sphujidh vaja (a palm leaf ms of which exists in the Nepal Durbar Library ) and in the Vrddhayavanajātaka of Minarāja. Those verses also name the special objects and places governed by the different rāśis. Several verses of Kāśyapa are quoted by Utpala on Bș. S. 40 that deal with the materials or things that are under the influence of the several rāśis. For example, Mesa is the lord of garments, woollens, cloth made of the hair of a young goat, of Masūra pulse, wheat, regin, barley, gold and plants that grow on dry land. 838 The Vāmanapurāṇa 838a ( chap. 5.45-60 ) describes the appearance of the rāśis and the places and objects they reside in or dominate and the verses closely resemble the wording employed in the two Yavanajātakas of Sphujidhvaja and Minarāja. Some verses are quoted below by way of illustration. From Varāha's description it appears that Mesa, Vrsabha, Karkata, Simha, Vrścika, Makara and Mina are figures of animals (either four-footed or

insects) and the remaining five resemble human beings with special characteristics in each case. These rāśi names have more or less the same meanings in Babylonia, 839 in Europe inclu ding Greece and in India. But it should not be supposed that everywhere the several groups of stars were imagined to be identical with the figures of the same animals or of human beings. In China for instance, the twelve rāśis are rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, serpent, horse, sheep, monkey, hen, dog and pig( Encyclo paedia Americana, vol. 29 under the word 'zodiac' and New Funk and Wagnall's Encyclopaedia vol. 36 under Zodiac '1839a. It is further stated that these are still found in some parts of Asia, in Japan and also among the remains of the Aztec race in America. There are many who deny that except for a few signs (like the Scorpion) thera is hardly any very striking similarity between the twelve groups of constellations called Aries &c. and the natural appearance of the objects denoted by the twelve names.840 The origin of the names assigned to Zodiacal signs is unknown. The zodiacal signs named Mesa, Vrsabha &. are purely imaginary, are mere subjective configurations of stars which appear to be in one plane and which appear to certain persons to possess somehow the outline of a scorpion or a lion which are, as modern astronomy tells us, situated at enormous distances (light years as they are called) from each other. The same constellation is often given different names; e. g. the constellation called Great Bear was called by Thales 'the wain' (waggon drawn by horses). The twelve Zodiacal signs are clearly absent from the sacred astronomy of Egypt 841 and the Egyptians know nothing of the Zodiac before the

G. Pinches. On p.167 the latter says that Europe is indebted to the Babyloniads for the names of the signs of the Zodiac except Crab and Archer and sets out the Babylonian names with their meanings and modern names (Ram &c.). These two tables do not agree. Babyloniaos called Capricorn goat-fish. Bouche Leclercq (on p. 57 note 1) gives a list of the twelve Chaldean zodiacal signs, which differs from both the above.

Alexandrian age and very few Zodiacs are older than the Roman times. Since Assyriologists began to reveal the astronomica: knowledge in the valley of the Euphrates, the Babylonian origin of the Zodiac has been taken for granted by almost all scholars.812 The dissenting voice is that of E. J. Webb in Names of stars '8!3 who very strenuously argues against the Babylonian origin of the Zodiacal signs and holds that the Zodiac as we know it is a Greek invention and that Cleostratus who according to Pliny was concerned in forming it lived about 520 B. C. In spite of the vehemence of Webb's arguments, in my humble opinion, he is far from convincing and for the present at least the Babylonian origin of the Zodiacal signs has to be accepted. The passage of Pliny on which Webb relies is differently understood by Prof. J. K. Forheringham.814 The latest work of Sarton on 'History of Science' (1953) holds that the Zodiac had been distinguished by Babylonian astronomers a thousand years before Cleostratus and all that Cleostratus probably did was to divide those constellations into twelve equal lengths of the ecliptic i.e. the twelve signs of the Zodiac. A somewhat amusing argument has been advanced by Hickey 845 that the fact that there are in the sky no animals (figures) suggestive of Egypt or India such as the hippopotamus and the elephant seems to rule out those countries as sources. Is there any logical necessity that certain animals must be introduced in a system of Zodiacal signs if that system originated in a certain country that may be the home of dozens of wild and tame animals? Are all the principal animals of Mesopotamia or of Greece included in the seven animals that figure as signs, if one of the above two was the origin

of the present Zodiacal signs? All the seven animals in the Zodiac are found in abundance in India even now, while some of them may not be found in the present day Greece or Baby lonia. At present I am only concerned to say that out of the three ancient lands, viz. Egypt, Mesopotamia and Greece, Mesopotamia has the greatest claims to be regarded as the source of the Zodiacal signs. The case of India will be dealt with a little later on.

dvisvabhāva ( of both characters ), as saumya (mild ) and krūra ( fierce or malignant ), as dinabala ( powerful by day ), niśābala (powerful by night ), as prṣthoduya (rising from the hind part), sirṣodaya ( rising by their head first ) or ubhayodaya, and as lords of the four main directions (east &c.). The above table will show at a glance these classifications, in which n. stands for niśābala, d. for dinabala, p. for prṣthodaya and s. for sirṣodaya. 

The Brhajjātaka compresses these details in I. 10–11 and Utpala explains the purpose of some of these technical terms. Yātrā (invasion ) undertaken on śīrṣodaya rāśis yields the desired result but if undertaken on prsthodaya rāśis there is failure and one's army is routed. Those born on krūra signs are of cruel nature and those born on saumya signs are mild by nature, while those born on male signs are energetic and those born on female signs are mild. Those born on cara signs are unsteady by nature, those born on sthira signs are of a fixed nature and those born on dvisvabhāva signs are of mixed chara cter. The knowledge of the signs as lords of quarters is useful in finding out the direction where a person who stole something on a particular sign could be found or the stolen article could be found. Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos I. 11 speaks of Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius as solid signs ( sthiru) and Gemini, Virgo Sagittarius, Pisces as bi-corporeal ( dvideha or dvisvibhāva), and in I. 12 there is agreement with Bṛhajjātaka as to the masculine and feminine signs but there is disagreement as to diurnal ( dinabala ) and nocturnal signs ( niśābala ), since Ptolemy holds that Aries and other signs are alternately diurnal or nocturnal, while Varāha holds Aries and the next three and also Sagittarius and Capricornus as nocturnal and the rest diurnal. It does not appear that the Brhajjātaka knows of the commanding and obeying signs (Tetrabiblos I. 14 ) and of signs which behold each other or of disjunct signs (Tetrabiblos I. 15 and 16). The Bṛ, J. (I. 20) and Laghujātaka I. 6 assign the following colours to the twelve rāśis from Mesa onwards viz, red, white, green (like a parrot's body ), dark-red (pink), whitish like smoke, speckled, dark, golden, yellowish, variegated, deep brown (like ichneu mon), white. There is hardly anything corresponding to this in the Tetrabiblos. The rāśis are also divided into four classes viz, anthropomorphic ( Mithuna, Kanya, Tulā, Dhanus forepart, Kumbha), quadruped (Mesa, Vrsa, Simha, Dhanus latter portion, Makara forepart), aquatic (Karkata, Mina, Makara

latter part ), insect (Scorpion). Vide Tetrabiblos IV. 4 pp. 389 and 391 for slightly varying enumeration. 

Br. J. (chap. 17. 1-12 ) sets out the characteristics of persons born when the Moon was in Mosa and the following rāśis and remarks at the end (in verse 13 ) that the results described will come out fully if the moon, the rāśi it occupies and the lord of that rāśi are powerfu]. In Bṛ. J. I. 19 it is said that two-footed rāśis ( mithuna, kanyā, tulā, kumbha and forepart of dhanus) are powerful by day if they be in kendra; four-footed rāśis ( mesa, vṣsa, simha, makara foropart and dhanus latter part ) are power ful at night in kendra position and the rest i. e. watery signs and insect signs (kulira, vrścika, mina and latter part of makara ) are powerful at twilight, when in kendra position. Bļ. J. 18. 20 provides that similar results (as in chap. 17) follow if a person is born when the lagna at his birth is mesa or any one of the other rāśis. 

Planets, their relations to the rāśis and their conjoint influ. ence will now be briefly indicated. We saw above (pp. 493-495) that in the Vedic Samhitās and Brāhmaṇas express references to planets other than Jupiter are almost absent, that in some Vedic Verses five planets and Venus ( as Vena) appear to be referred to. Svarbhānu, the son of an asura, is said to have struck the sun with darkness ( i. e. caused an eclipse ) in Rg. V. 40. 5, 6, 8, 9. In the Chāndogya Upanisad the soul that has acquired true knowledge is said to shake off the body after casting off all evil like a horse ( that casts off dust by ) shaking his hair ( mane and tail) or like the moon becoming free from the mouth of Rāhu. 847 The Maitrāyaṇi Upaniṣad mentions Sani, Rāhu ( ascending node ) and Ketu ( descending node). 84 But hardly anything is said about the astrological significance of planets in the ancient Vedic Literature. In the Mahābhārata there are plenty of references to the evil influence of planets, but that is restricted to naksatras. Both Rāhu and Ketu are said in Karpaparva to rise in the sky for ( i. e. portending ) the destruc tion of the world. 849 Kautilya offers the curious information that a foreknowledge of rainfall can be had from the position, the motion and the garbhādhāna of Jupiter, from the rising, setting and motion of Venus and from the natural and unnatural

aspects of the sun and that from the sun the sprouting of the seed (can be predicted), from Jupiter the formation of abundant sheaves of corn when the seeds are sown and from the ( movements ) of Venus rainfall (can be predicted ). 850 It will be seen from the above that general or universal ( not individual or horoscopic) astrology like the reports made by royal priests in Mesopotamia was prevalent in India many centuries before Christ. The Brhajjātaka ( II. 2–3 ) enumerates the nine planets, Sun, Moon, Mercury, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Venus, Rāhu and Ketu and furnishes some synonyms of all these. 

Observations of planets by the Babylonians go back to 2nd millennium B. C. Venus was the first to be studied. Tables about Venus based on observations are found from 1921-1901851 B. C.; Jupiter and Mars were also observed. Jupiter was held to be normally favourable when he shone brightly or followed the moon, while Mars was the planet of ill-luck, but, if Mars shone weakly or disappeared, its evil influence disappeared. Saturn ab its name indicates ('firm standing one') was regarded mostly a planet of good luck. Various favourable prognostications were made about a child, according as the planets like the Moon, Venus or Jupiter were rising or unfavourable prognostications were made if Mars was rising or if Jupiter or Venus were setting:85! Each planet received a variety of names in the astronomical texts of Babylonia. The teaching that every planet has its exaltation i. e. the strongest pitch of its might and influence when in a particular sign goes back to ancient Babylonia. 853 The arrangements of the order of planets differed at different times. Planet comes from a Greek word meaning a wanderer' and the word was applied to the planets because as compared with the stars they appeared to wander in different ways and at

different times.85€ In modern times there are three more planeta, viz. Uranus, Neptune and Pluto discovered respectively in 1781, 1846 and 1930 A. D.851 Bouché Leclercq mentions that modern astrologers asserted that Chaldeans saw Uranus and Neptune and three other planets (Juno, Vulcan and Pluto), when they had good eyes (p. 573 note 2 of 'L' Astrologie Grecque). 

The Bť. J. (1). 2-3), Sārāvali (IV. 10-11) and Rājamārtaṇḍa (verses 8-15) set out the various names for the sun, the moon and the other seven planets. They are specified in the note856 

854. C. V. Macl can on 'labylonian Astrology and its relation to tbe Old Testament' (United Church Publishing House, Toronto) p. 27, Prof. Neugebauer in E. S. A. p. 162 (for arrangements of planets in cuneiform texts in Seleucid period and in Greek horoscopes ). In the Seleucid period the standard arrangement was Jupiter-Venus-Mercury-Saturn--Mars. Ordinary arrangement in Greek horoscopes is Sun, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury. For the planetary week the arrangement in Greece is said to be Saturo-Jupiter-Mars-Sun-Venus-Mercury-Moon, On p. 163 Prof. Neugebauer thinks that Hindu arrangement of planets is obviously Greek in origin for two reasons, as it is based on the arrangement according to distance from the earth and also on a division of days into 24 hours, which is not Babylonian but Hellenistic and ultimately of Egyptian origin. In this latter he can be said to be wrong, as a similar arrangement of week days can be arrived at by relying on the 60 ghaṭikā system of India. We saw above that horū in Indian astrology has three meanings, viz. Jātaka, lagna and half a siga, but the very early Sanskrit astrological texts at least do not appear to employ the word horā in the sense of 'hour or oth part of tbe whole day or sth part of the day. Any one who asserts that the arrangement of week days is copied from the Greeks must prove two things, (1) the definite time when the Greeks bit upon the particular arrangement of planets for purposes of week-days and (2) the borrowing people had definitely not arrived at the same arrangement before the Greeks, Prof. Neugebauer, so far as I can see, offers hardly ady evi deace on any of these two matters beyond mere assertions and conjectures. It bas further to be remembered that Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I. p. 343) states tbat nobody in India uses the hours except the astrologers, for they speak of the dominants of the hours. The 30 muhurtas of alorūtra are much older than the Satapatha Er, and it was easy to divide a mubūrta into two gadis or ghaṭikās as the Arthasastra does (I. 19 p. 37 Nālikābhirabarastadba rātrim ca vibhajet) and Purāṇas like Viṣṇu VI. 3. 6-9 do. There is hardly anything in the vast Sanskrit Literature (of ancient or medieval times) to show that common people or writers ( not being astronomers or astrologers ) employed the method of 24 hours of the day,

below and the names underlined are deemed by Western writers to have been derived from Greek; but it should be noted that no Greek name for the moon occurs in these or other works and I am not convinced that Jiva is a Greek word or adaptation of a Greek word. The word Jiva occurs in the Rgveda itself in 

many places (as in Rg. I. 164.30,X. 18.37) and means - living being, an individual' and in Chandogya Upanisad VI. 3.2 it means ' individual soul'. When Brhaspati came to be regarded as the most prominent of planets and was said to preside over knowledge and happiness (as in Br. J. II. 1. 'Jivo jñāna-sukham') he came to be regarded as the very life of beings and was called Jiva. The Sārāvali (X. 116) says that Bṛhaspati is the life of men (Brhaspatir-nrnam jivah). In Bhujabala it is said 'what will all the planets do to him in whose horoscope Jupiter is in kendra position. A herd of wild elephants is killed by a single lion.'857 The Br. J. and Sārāvali provide that further synonyms may be derived from popular usage. 

In the following some characteristics of the planets (based on Br. J. II. 5-7) are brought together, viz. the colour ruled by each, the lords of each, the direction, element, Veda and class ( brahmana, ksatriya &c.) dominated by each and whether they are beneficent or malefic.

Tetrabiblos 1. 5 regards Jupiter, Venus and Moon as beneficent and places the Sun on the same footing as Mercury.

In the Yogayātrā VI. 1 a distinction is made between the gods that rule the eight directions and the planets that rule them, Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirrti, Varuna, Vāyu, Yaksa (Kubera ) and Siva are the lords of the eight directions from East to North-East, while the same directions are governed by planets as in the above table. 

The purpose for these classifications is explained as follows: As regards colours ruled by planets, they are useful in indicat ing the colour of the thing lost by or stolen from a man and the colour of the flowers with which the planets are to be worshipped; the lords of the planets are to be worshipped along with the planets in grahapūjā; the direction in which a king should march on an invasion is indicated by planets that rule the directions; according as beneficent or malefic planets are power ful in the horoscope, the character of the person concerned is indicated as good or bad. The Br. J. II. 7 further provides that the Moon, the Sun and Jupiter are lords of sattva-guna, Mercury and Venus of rajo-guṇa, Mars and saturn of tamoguṇa. Utpala points out that Varāba differs from Yavanośvara, who regards the Sun, Mars and Jupiter as Sattvika, the Moon and Venus as full of rajoguṇa, Saturn as having tamoguṇa and Mercury taking on the character of the planet with which it is in conjunction.858 Rāhu is the ascending node or the point where the orbit of the moon intersects the ecliptic in passing northwards. Bṛ. J. (II. 8–11) and Laghujātaka II. 13–19 describe the form and appearance of the planets from the Sun to Saturn, giving full rein to association of ideas, imagination and to personification of them. For illustration, I translate one verse ( 10 ) *Jupiter 859 has a large body, his hair and eyes are brownish in colour, he has eminent intellect and has a phlegmatic constitution; Venus is given to pleasures, has handsome body and pretty eyes, has wind and phlegm in his constitution and black but curling. hair on his head.'

It was said that if Jupiter was in his own house (i. e. Dhanus or Mina), then Jupiter also ruled ovor gold. 861 The object of assigning these was practical, viz. the astrologer could judge of the place of birth if the planet was powerful or of the place of the thief or, if a question were put about the food which one invited to a dinner may be served with, the powerful planet would suggest the kind of food. 

The Br. J. (II. 5 ) states that the Sun, Mars and Jupiter are masculine, the Moon and Venus feminine, while Mercury and Saturn are neuter or common (nepuñsaka ). Here Tetrabiblos differs ( I. 6), as it regards Saturn as masculine. Acc. to Bṛ. J. II. 21 the Moon, Mars and Saturn are nocturnal (powerful at night), the Sun, Jupiter and Venus are diurnal (powerful by day) and Mercury is common (both diurnal and nocturnal ). The Tetrabiblos differs (I. 7) by making Venus nocturnal and Saturn diurnal. 

860. Vide Tatrabiblos III. 12 pp. 319 and 321 for parts of the human body governed by planets, which description differs from that of the Br. J.

The relation between planets and the chief metals was, it seems, based on colour similarity. The theory that different planets governed different areas and limbs of the body led to the influence of astrology on medicine,

(Soc. II, Ch. XVI 

Certain rāśis are declared to be the houses ( svagrha) of planets and certain other rāśis as their ucca (exaltation) and certain parts or degrees of the ucca are declared to be paramocca; the 7th rāśi from the ucca is said to be nica i. e. depressed and certain parts (or degrees ) of the latter are said to be paramanica. The Sun and the Moon have each only one rāśi as svagsha, while the other five planets have two each. The following diagram will indicate all this at a glance :

The figures under signs of exaltation and depression are the añīas ( degrees) rospectively of paramocca and paramanica. The explanation offered by Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja and the Vṛddhayavana-jātaka of Minarāja is that the sign of Leo was assigned to the Sun as his house because it is the most powerful sign and Cancer (a watery sign) was assigned to the Moon, and the Sun and the Moon each gave one sign out of the remaining to the other five planets viz. Kanyā, Tulā, Vrścika, Dhanus and Makara were given by the Sun to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn ( arranged according to distance ) and the Moon gave to the same five planets one each of the rāśis of Mithuna, Vrsabha, Mesa, Mina and Kumbha (vide my paper on ‘Yavaneśvara and Utpala' in J. B. B. R. A. Ş. vol. 30 on p. 9Ptolemy on svagrhas 

577 

for the verses of Minaraja and p. 7 for translation). Tetrabiblos I. 17 practically gives a similar explanation about houses (svagrhas) and I. 19 agrees with Br. J. I. 13 about the exaltation and depression signs. Ptolemy does not give the degrees (of paramocca and paramanica 862 ). 

That rāśi that is occupied by its own lord or has an aspect (drsti ) of its lord or is occupied by Mercury or Jupiter or lias an aspect with them is powerful 863 if it be not occupied by any one or more of the remaining planets or has no aspect with any one of the rest. There is a further provision that Scorpion if it is in the 7th house is powerful, the human signs (Mithuna, Kanyā, Tulā, the forepart of Dhanus and Kumbha ) are powerful in the lagna, the watery signs (Karkata, Mina, latter half of Makara ) are powerful if they occupy the 4th house and the quadrupeds ( Mesa, Vṛṣa, Simha, latter half of Dhanus, and the forepart of Makara ) are powerful in the 10th house (Br. J. I. 17.) 

The natural powerfulness of planets is in the following order: Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, the Sun, each succeeding one is more powerful than each preceding one; if the power of any two or more is equal in other respects, then one has to take into consideration this natural powerfulness for determining which is more powerful. 564 

The astrological houses in a horoscope are twelve and each is expressed by various synonyms, many of which indicate what particular matters are to be judged from the state of that house. They are enumerated in Br. J. I. 15-19, Laghujātaka I. 15-19, Sārāvali III. 26-33.

It should be noted that the appellations given to these bhāvas are of two classes, (1) those which are used as mere designations, without indicating the special function of the house, such as horā, duścikya, meṣūrana, rihpha, caturasra; the second class of these appellations conveys the special functions of the houses, such as tanu (body), sva ( wealth) or kutumba (family ), sahaja ( brothers ). 

There are certain appellations that apply to a number of houses. The 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th houses are all called kantaka, kendra, catustaya, the houses beyond the kendra are called paṇaphara ( 2nd, 5th, 8th and 11th ), the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 12th houses are called A poklima, 6th, 8th and 12th houses are called trika; the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th houges are called upacaya and the rest are called apacaya. Garga held that the 3rd, 6th, 10th and 11th are called upacaya only if there is no aspect of them with malefic planets or with the enemy of the lord of them. Trikoṇa is claimed to be a Greek word. 

From the several names of the bhāvas, it appears that the following were to be predicted from the several bhāvas; from first bhāva, health and the growth of the body; from 2nd the 

Prognostications froin twelie bhāvas

wealth of one's family; from 3rd brothers (and sisters ) and valour; from 4th relatives friends, happiness, house and mother; from 5th sons, intellect, learning; from 6th enemies and wounds; from 7th wife, love affairs., marriage; from 8th death, one's foibles and sins; from 9th dharma, elders (including parents ), austerities; from 10th acticns and dignities or position and father; from 11th acquisition of good qualities and of wealth; from 12th expenditure, debts. 

Thibaut (in Grundriss p. 68 ) following Jacobi boldly asserts that the doctrine of the twelve astrological houses which is a chief point in the Indian system found developed in Varāha mihira does not occur among Western authorities earlier than Firmicus Maternus ( middle of 4th century A. D.) and that Greek astrology entered into India only between Firmicus and Varāhamihira. One is regretfully constrained to say that this is a case of one blind man following another. In the first place the conception of houses ( bhāvas ) is not totally absent even in Ptolemy's Tetrabiblos, as can be seen in II. 8 p. 191, III, 10 pp. 273-275 (Loeb Classical Library), where houses I, VII, IX, X and XI are referred to, though Ptolemy does not pay much attention to the system of bhūras. Probably this escaped the attention of both Jacobi and Thibaut. In the second place, the system of bhāvas does not occur for the first time in Varāba. Varāha refers to a host of Indian writers before him as will be shown below in whose works the system appears in a fully developed form. It is not possible to believe that all this vast literature was developed in a hundred years or so after Firmicus. Besides, authors like Garga, Parāśara, who are placed between the Vedāngajyotisa and the siddhāntas ( about 800 B.C. to 250 A.D.) know this system and Garga is assigned to 50 B.C. by Kern (Preface to Bṛ.S. p.50). Thibaut, a great scholar, proposing to write an encyclopaedic work on Jyotisa is content to rely on Jacobi and does not appear to have cared to see for himself even Ptolemy and examine works like the Atharvana Jyotisa, the Vaikhānasasūtra, Viṣṇudharmottara which teach astrology based on naksatras. This, to say the least, is most surprising. Prof. Zinner ( in 'Stars above us') p. 67 says that the twelve houses denote life, business, brothers, father, sons, health, wife, death, religion, gain, good deeds, gaol. In the 3rd place Thibaut takes no account of Sanskrit works written by Yavanas settled in India, to whom Varaba frequently refers, from whom he sometimes differs on vital points of doctrine and from whom Utpala quotes hundreds of versos, 

580 

History of Dharmaśāstru 



which are found in the ancient Yavanajātaka of Sphujidhvaja. Fur ther, it has been shown above (pp. 533-34 ) that extant references to astrology based on naksatras actually exhibit the names of at least five bhāvas centuries before Firmicus. It is quite possible to argue that Firmicus borrowed his astrology from the predecessors of Varāha, who were Greeks and wrote in Sanskrit, or that even Ptolemy did so as he knows of the bhāvas, but 

furnishes only a dilettante treatment. It may be further noted - that no adaptations of Greek words for all the bhāvas from the 

first to the twelfth are to be found in Sanskrit works. Such words occur only for some viz. Ist, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 10th and 12th bhāvas and for groups of a few bhāvas ( such as kendra, pana phara and āpoclima). Besides, the peculiar points to be deduced from the several bhāvas as stated in Br. J do not all agree with what Firmicus says. Varāha designates the 2nd bhāva as kutumba and sva (family, wealth ) while Firmicus calls it 'lucrum' (how one shall earn one's living); the 11th bhāva is called āya (income) and bhāva by Varāha while Firmicus calls it the house of good deeds; in Firmicus the 4th bhāva is that of father or parents, while Varaha calls it 'bandhu'(relatives ) and gļha in B:. J. and ‘suhrt'( friends ) in Laghujātaka and some later Indian writers say that 4th and 10th bhāvas are respectively of the mother and father. In Firmicus the 6th and 12th bhāvas are respectively wealth and jail, while Varāha bolds them to be 'enmity' and 'expenditure'. 

Certain technical words have yet to be explained. One meaning of horā is half a rūśi. In the case of the rāśis of odd numbers ( viz. 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 ) the lord of the first half is the sun and that of the 2nd half is the moon, while in the case of rāsis of even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ) the lord of the 1st half is the moon and of the 2nd half the sun (Br. J. I. 11). The purpose of this is that those born on sun's horā are energetic ( assertive) by nature and those born on moon's horā are mild by nature. Bṛ. J. (I. 12) mentions the view of some 865 (of 

865. केचित्त होरां प्रथमा भपस्य वाञ्छन्ति लाभाधिपतोद्वितीयम् । देवाणसंज्ञामपि वर्णयन्ति TETES TERTISITI TE WA I. 12; fate quotes on this a verse of gaat 'आद्या तु होरा भवनस्य पत्युरेकादश क्षेत्रपतद्वितीया । स्वद्वादशैकादशराशिपानां देष्काणसंज्ञाः क्रमशस्त्रयोत्र ॥'.

P TG ( Nepal ms.) the 24 horās of the 12 rāśis are described at length in about 48 rather poetic verses and it wiods up the descriptioo with the words 'garai EITT Yaaroprii H agurauf!!)13 (folio 9.)

Yavanesyara, according to Utpala ) that the lord of the first horā is the same as the lord of the rāśi and the lord of the second horā is the lord of the 11th house in the horoscope. The result of this view would be that all planets can be lords of horās and not the sun and the moon alone as Varāha, Satya and others say. Each rasi (of 30 degrees) is divided into three parts, each of 10 degrees, called dreskāna or drekkāṇa or drkāṇa or drgāna ( in Bṛ. J. III. 5, probably for the sake of the metre ). The lords of the three parts of each rāśi are respectively the lord of the rāśi itself ( of the first part), the lord of the 5th rāśi ( of the 2nd part ) and the lord of the 9th rāśi ( of the 3rd part). For example, in the case of Vrsabha (of which the lord is Venus ), the lords of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd parts are respectively Venus, Mercury (lord of 5th from Vrsabha) and Saturn ( lord of 9th from Vrsabha). And go on for the other rāśis. 

A few words must be said about dreskāṇa. Weber and others think that it represents the Greek word 'decanoi'. The 

dekans' were a legacy from ancient Egypt, which 366 had origi nally no zodiacal signs. Bouché-Leclercq has discussed 867 the question of decans at great length in his 'L' Astrologie Grecque' pp. 215–240. The decanal system can be traced as far back as the third dynasty of Egypt (about 2800 B. C.) and may be older still. Originally, the decans were conspicuous stars or groups of stars rising at particular hours of the night during 36 successive periods of ton days each that constituted the year in Egypt. The series began with Sirius and they were distributed in a wide equatorial belt. The ancient Egyptians had a fixed idea that each division of time, large or small, must have its protective tutelary deity. Therefore, the decans were originally the divinities (or genii ) that presided over the 36 decades of the Egyptian year. Each period of ten days was marked by the rising of the next decan on the eastern horizon at sunset. Bouché Leclercq points out that in the Egyptian language a specific name (like the Greek word 'decanos') is not met with and that the decans are designated by a number of synonyms. When the Zodiacal signs were introduced in Egypt by the

Greeks, the tutelary spirits slipped into or got intertwined with the signs of the Zodiac (each sign of 30 degrees being divided into decans of 10 degrees) and played an important part in astrology. The original division referred to the equator, while the later distribution of 36 decans among the twelve signs refers to the 868 ecliptic. Bouché Leclercq avers (p. 53 ) that it has been proved beyond doubt that the Egyptian Zodiacs ( they had four, viz. 2 at Denderah, one at Esneh and one at Akhnum ) are all of the Roman epoch and are imitations of the Greek Zodiac. 

The Brhajjātaka has a special chapter 27 (in 36 verses ) called dreśkāṇādhyāya in which the 36 presiding deities of dreśkāṇas are described. This chapter appears to conserve the ancient Egyptian conception of the decans as guardian 869 divi nities. The language must be regarded as rather metaphorical or symbolic. It is parts of the Zodiac that are being described. Nearly two-thirds of 36 are male and the rest are female. Some composite figures of males and females and quadrupeds or birds or serpents occur. In verses 2, 19 and 21 (of chap. 27) Varāha expressly says that he only sets out what the Yavanas have said. 

868. Vide Webb in Journal of Hellenistic Studies, vol. 48 (1925) p. 56, Prof. Neugebauer in E. S. A. pp. 81-83. The latter gotes that with the exception of Sirius and its neighbours decans have defied identification with koowo constellations. Vide Prof. Neugebauer's latest note on The Egyptian Decans'in 'Vistas in Astronomy' (ed. A. Beer, vol. I. pp. 47-51). 

869. Vide for 'Dreskāna' Colebrooke's Miscellaneous essays, vol. II. pp. 364-373. Colebrooke (on pp. 370-71 ) states that Manilius employs the word Decania, that Firmicus differs in the names and does not allow the complete degrees to each decanus. This would show that the Bṛ. J. could not have followed about dreskāna Firmicus in astrology as Jacobi suppo sed but some other more ancient author. Nor can it be said that the Br J. follows Manilius. The description of the middle dreṣkāṇa of Meṣa ratber resembles the rotund figure in Plate 10 in Prof. Neugebauer's book "Exact Sciences in Antiquity'p. 83, which plate reproduces the representation of the Decan deities on the tomb of Senmut (in Egypt), B. L. Van Der Waerden in his paper • Babyloniao Astronomy; thirty-six stars' in Journal of Near East Stadies, vol. VIII (pp. 6-26 ) shows how thirty-six stars from old Babylonian times finally became mixed up with the twelve Zodiaca! sigas and 36 Egyptian decaos. Oo p. 8 he gives lists of 36 constellations, the so called 'decans', which were found on coffin lids of the middle king dom in Egypt and on ceilings of tombs belonging to kings of the New Kiogdom. The risings, culminations and settings of decan constellations were supposed to determine not only the date but also the time of the night. On p. 20 he gives a table of Babyloniao stars and their modern equiva lent stars and their times. 

Description of dreṣkānas 

583 

Here I translate two verses (2 and 21 ) 'the Yavanas have declared the form of the middle dreskāṇa of Mesa sign ( Aries ) viz. she is a female clad in red garments, intent on ornaments and food, has the mouth of a horse and has a jar-like (i, e. rotund ) form, she is oppressed by thirst and is standing on one leg '; 'the Yavanas have declared the appearance of the last dreskāṇa of Tula (Scales) as a male having the form of a monkey, decked with ornaments, frightening deer in a forest, wearing golden armour and quiver, and holding fruits and flesh ( in his hands )'. There is nothing in the Tetrabiblos of Ptolemy corres ponding to this and Varāha probably refers to a Sanskrit work by a Yavana writer much earlier than even Ptolemy and Mani lius. Manilius, author of 'Astronomica', a didactic poem on astrology, referred to the decans but he wrote about 9 A. D. and it appears that decans had gone out of vogue in Greece by the time of Ptolemy. Bouché-Leclercq notes (p. 219) that the system of decans is a characteristic of Manilius and that after him one does not hear it spoken of any longer. On p. 219 of his work Bouché-Leclercq furnishes a figure of the Decans of Manilius, which is entirely different from the descriptions of decans given by Br. J. Manilius divides each sign into three parts, each of which represents no deity but the signs themselves. For example, Aries is divided into three parts and those three are the same as Arios, Taurus and Gemini. The Sārāvali 8694 in chap. 49 devotes thirty-six verses to the description of 36 dreskānas, but the des cription differs from that of the Br. J. as the note below will show. The Sārāvali had probably before it a Sanskrit yarana work different from the one relied upon by Br. J. 

Some other technical words may be mentioned and defined here. The six items, viz. the rāśi of a planet, the horā, droskāna, navāmsa, dvādaśāmśa and triśāmśa of the rāśi are each called the varga or Sad-varga of that planet (Br. J. I. 9). The first navāmśa of Mesa, Karki, Tūlā and Makara ( that are cara signs )

This indicates that the यवनजातक bad a third tradition about tops.

is called Vargottama, so also the 5th navāmśa of Vrsabha, Simha, Vrscika and Kumbha (that are sthira ), and the 9th navāmsa of Mithuna, Kangā, Dhanus, Mina ( that are dvisrabhūra) are called Vargottama (Br. J. I. 14) and they yield beneficent results.870 The vargottama-navāmśas of all rāśis bear the same names as the rāśis themselves. The Yoga called Sunaphā occurs when some planet other than the sun occupies the 2nd house from that occupied by the Moon; the Yoga Anaphā occurs when some planet other than the sun occupies the 12th house from that occupied by the Moon and Durudharā occurs when planets occupy the 2nd and 12th houses from that occupied by the Moon. The Yoga called Kema-druma occurs when the above three don't occur and the Moon is not in kendra position or if kendra is not occupied by any of the planets (except the Sun). Br. J. 13. 4 notices that varieties of Anapha and Sunaphā are 31 each and the varieties of Durudharā are 180. The Bș. J. does not devote more than 6 verses to all these four yogas but the Vṛddha-Yavanajātaka of Minarāja has 30 verses on Anaphā, 30 verses on Sunaphā, 172 verses on Durudharā. The rāśi which is 2nd from the rāsi occupied by the Sun in a horoscope is called 'Veśi' (Bṭ. J. I. 20). All the above five words are said to be Greek, The word 'liptā' meaning 60th part of a degree' is also said to be Greek. The word 'harija' occurring in Br. J.V.17 means 'horizon'and Kern says it is adapted from Greek (Preface to Bṭ. . p. 29 ).8704 The Greek word is horos ( boundary ). All the words used by Varāha and supposed to be Greek by Weber, Kern and others may be brought together in one place here ( 37 in all); Kriya, Tāyuri, Jituma, Kulira, Leya, Pāthena, Jūka, Kaurpya, Tauksika, Akokera, Hrdroga, Ittha (?); Heli, Āra, Himna, Jiva, Asphujit, Kona; horā, droskāna, kendra, trikoṇa, panaphara, āpoklima, mesūrana, duścikya, hibuka, jāmitra, dyūna, rihpha, anaphā, sunaphā, durudharā, kemadruma, vesi, liptā, harija. I dispute the derivation of kulira and trikona from Greek and Kern agrees that they are pure Sanskrit words. I also doubt whether Jiva is an adaptation of Zeus. Zeus

agrees with Sanskrit Dyaus and not with Jiva and Zeus is an Indo-European word meaning 'Heaven' or 'sky'. The different forms of the word dreṣkāṇa or 'dyūtam' for 'dyūnam' should not be separately counted. The word horā is used in early Indian astrology in three different senses, none of which agrees with the sense of hour. It is possible that even in Greek it is a word borrowed from Egypt or Babylonia, since in the definite sense of an hour, it is much later and it is doubtful whether Hipparchus (140 B. C.) uses it in that sense. If we exclude these four words only 33 words may at the most be argued to have been adapted from Greek. Some of these words such as the 12 names of rāśis and six of the planets, some names of the bhāras like hibuka, jāmitra, dyūna and kendra have several synonyms ( sometimes by the dozen ) in Sanskrit employed in Br. J. and so no emphasis should be laid on them. They were mentioned by Br. J. because they had been employed by ancient Greek authors who wrote in Sanskrit and so Br. J. took cognisance of them for the sake of completeness of treatment. Even kendra meaning ist, 4th, 7th and 10th houses or bhāvas has two Sanskrit synonyms 'kaptaka' and catustaya', besides the fact that its meaning is different in San skrit astrology from the meaning of the Greek word (kentron, spike). Therefore, barely ten Greek words like Anaphā, Sunaphā remain which have a very minor role to play in Indian astrology and it is a far cry to argue or assert from the occurrence of these few words that the whole Indian astrology as developed in Varāha mihira was borrowed from Greek works. It is extremely doubtful whether any Indians except a few sages or gymnosophists ever went to Greece or lived long in Greece or settled there and returned to India to spread Greek words and astrological know ledge in India; but we have ample evidence that Greeks settled in India, composed inscriptions in Sanskrit and wrote extensive works on astrology in Sanskrit. Vide 'L'Astrologie Grecque' by Bouché-Grecque p. XIX for the Greek. Latin, French names and astrological symbols of the signs of the zodiac and planets and G. R. Kaye in Memoir No. 18 of the Archaeo logical Survey of India pp. 39-40 (for the Greek twelve names of Zodiacal signs and nine other Greek words occurring in Br. J.) and p. 100 for Greek 'bhāyas' and symbols for signs and planets. 

A good deal is said in Br. J. II. 15-17, Laghujātaka II. 10-12, Sārāvali IV, 28-31, Muhurta-cintamani (VI. 27-28 ) and other works about the planets being friends, enemies or indifferent

It may be noticed that there is no reciprocity for these relationships. For example, the Moon has Mercury as one of its friends, while Mercury has the Moon as its enemy; the Moon has no enemy but Venus has the Moon as its enemy. According to the Yavanas no planet is sama ( neither friend nor foo) but that planets are either friends or enemies. 871 

As regards temporary friendships and enmities the following rules apply; when planets are in 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 10th, 11th or 12th places from each other they become friends for the occasion (such as marriage, invasion or journey &c.), otherwise they become enemies when in the same rāśi or in 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th or

3th from each other. There are differences of opinion here but they are passed over. 

The bala ( strength) of planets is of four kinds ( arises in four ways ) viz. place, direction, activity ( ceṣtā), time. A planet is powerful in its position when it is in its own house or in exaltation (ucca) or in its friend's house or in its trıkoṇa or navāmsa. This is sthānabala. Mercury and Jupiter are powerful in the east ( i. e. when they are in the lagna ), the Sun and Mars in the south (i. e, in the 10th house ), Saturn in the West (i. e. 7th house ), the Moon and Venus are powerful in the north ( i. e. 4th house). This is digbala. The Sun and Moon are powerful in the northern ayana 872 ( i. e. in the six rāśis from Capricorn); the remaining planets are powerful when they are retrograde or in conjunction with the Moon or when there is a fight ( between planets other than the Sun and the Moon ), the one to the north being more powerful. Garga quoted in the Adbhutasāgara says that grahayuddhu (fight of planets) occurs when one planet occults the other, or when it slightly covers, or when the light of one throws into the background the light of another or when one planet is to the left of the other slightly. This is ceṣtābala. The Moon, Mars and Saturn are powerful at night, Mercury is powerful both by day and night, and others are powerful by day; krūra and saumya planets are respectively powerful in the dark half and bright half of the month; a planet is powerful in the year of which he is the lord, or on his own week-day or horā or in

Conjunction of planets is of three kinds; when any planet is in conjunction with the sun, that is called astamaya (setting), when in conjunction with the moon it is called samāgaina, when the other planets, Mars &c. are in conjunction with each other that is called yuddha ( fight of the planets); (in the case of yuddba) tbat planet which is to the north of the other is called victorious or power ful (except in the case of Venus tbat is powerful when to the south of the other}. i 135i prua AHSHIRT JI 34FETI TETTI gatall FIT p. 207.

the month of which he is the lord. This is kūlabalı. 873 Yavane śvara says' for ten days from the 1st tithi of the bright half the Moon is of middling power but in the next period of ten daya (from sukla 11th to krsna ) 5th Moon's power is highest and in the last ten days (from krsna 6th to amūrūsyā) the Moon has slight power; but if Moon has an aspect with saumya planets (Jupiter &c. ) he is always powerful. 

A planet is said by Sārāvali to have nine vicissitudes, 874 dipta (blazing, when it is in exaltation), stastha ( at ease when it is in its svagrha ), nudita ( glad, when it is in a friend's stagrha ), śānta ( quiet, when it is in an auspicious zarga), sakta ( capable, when it is shining brightly ), nipidita ( oppressed, when it is overwhelmed by another planet ), bhita (frightened, when it is in depression ), vikala ( impaired when its light is lost is Sun's light), khala ( evil, when it is in the midst of evil company ). The Sārāvali ( V.5-13 ) describes at length the results of a planet being in these nine conditions. 

How even mythological accounts are pressed into service by astrological works may be well illustrated by two verses from the Yogayātrā of Varāhamihira: 'The Sun was born in Anga (Bengal), the Moon among Yavanas, Mars in Avanti ( Ujjayini), Mercury in Magadha, Jupiter in Sindhu, Venus in Bhojakata, Saturn in Surāstra ( Kathiawar ), Ketu among Mlecchas and Rāhu in Kalinga; if these planets are affected, they cause distress to the countries in which they were born: hence a king should invade the respective countries when any one or more of the planets are affected. 875

Doctrine of drsti 

589 

A very important doctrine of Indian astrology is that of drṣti (lit. glance, i. e aspect ). The Br. J. II. 13, Laghujātaka II. 8, Sārāyali IV. 32-33, Muhūrtadarśana I. 27 lay down the following rules. All planets 876 have a full aspect (pūrna.drsti) on the 7th house from the one which each occupies. Besides, Saturn has full aspect on the 3rd and 10th rāśi from the one which it occupies and on the planet which is 3rd or 10th from its own position. Similarly, Jupiter has full aspect on the 5th and 9th rāsi from the one it occupies and also on the planet that is 5th or 9th from itself; Mars has full drsti on the 4th and 8th rāśis and the planet in the same. So the Sun, Moon, Mercury and Venus have full drsti only on the 7th rāśi from the one each of them occupies and on the planet that is 7th from them. Besides, all planets have 1/4th drsti on the 3rd and 10th, half drsti on 5th and 9th, dṛsti on 4th and 9th. There is no aspect of any planet on any rāśi or sthāna except the seven expressly mentioned (viz. 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th ) and in the case of partial dụstis the fruit also is partial (i. e. 1, or :). The Tetrabiblos (I. 13 and 20 ) treats of four aspects viz. opposition (7th house of Varaha), trine ( 5th and 9th houses ), quartile ( 4th and 10th ), sextile ( difference of 60 degrees and two signs) and does not distinguish between fractions of drsṭis as Varāha does. So in the matter of aspects also there is substantial difference between Ptolemy and Varāha-mihira. 

Another important doctrine is that of gocara. It means 8769 the consideration about the auspicious or inauspicious positions of planets at any particular period in question in places either

In verse 2 atig says that the planets move one above the other, but, on account of the great distances, to the human eye they appear level with each other. The TECreat describes at length the results to different countries and peoples of yuddha between different planets.

ILLS 

declared auspicious or inauspicious judging from the rāśi of birth, The Muhūrta-cintāmaṇi in five verses (of chap. 4) deals with this subject. I shall illustrate the application of the word by some examples. If the Sun is in the 6th place from the rāśi of birth he is auspicious but if at the same time the 12th place from the rāśi of birth is occupied by other planets (except Saturn), then, though auspicious by himself, he becomes inauspicious. This result does not arise in case one planet is the father or son of the other (as Saturn is the son of the Sun and Mercury is the son of the Moon). Similarly, if Mercury is in 2nd place from rāśi of birth or in the 4th or 6th or 8th or 10th or 11th and other planets (except the Moon who is the father of Mercury ) are respectively in the 5th, 3rd, 9th, 1st, 8th or 12th, Mercury, though originally auspicious, becomes inauspicious for the time being. Kāraka is another word to be explained. It is rather compli cated. Br. J. XXII and Sārāvali 8766 Vl. and VII, deal with it. As many planets as occupy their own grha or ucca or Mulatri koma and also are in the 1st, 4th, 7th and 10th places ( in the horoscope ) they become Kārakas of each other, while the planet that is in the 10th place (in horoscope ) is specially kāraka. Suppose the lagna is Karka and the moon occupies it (it is moon's svagrha ) and Mars, Saturn, the Sun and Jupiter are in their uccas (i. e. in Makara, Tula, Mesa and Karkata respec tively), they are all kārakas of each other. Many more rules are given in this matter in Br, J. XXII. and Sārāvali VI. The Sārāvali gives ( VII. 7-13) another meaning. Each planet is specially concerned with, rules over or produces several matters or persons &c. I shall quote two verses. The Moon is the lord of poets, flowers, edibles, precious stones, silver, conch, salt, waters, clothes, ornaments, women, ghee, sesame, oils and sleep. Jupiter is the lord of auspicious things, dharma, rites for prosperity, greatness, education, orders, cities and nations, vehicles, seats, beds, gold, corn, dwelling house and sons. 

Then there is the doctrine of dusūs and antardaśūs of the seven planets. In the Vimsottarī system man's maximum life is supposed to be 120 years and in Astottarī it is supposed to be 108 and those are distributed among the planets in varying numbers of years and it is said that daśās have further

divisions of antardaśās. This doctrine is elaborated in the 8th chapter of the Brhajjātaka and Utpala quotes numerous verses from Yavaneśvara on this. The theory of Astakavarga is set out by Varāba in chapter 9 of the Brhajjātaka viz. that the seven planets and lagna are eight entities and they produce their fullest or auspicious results only when they are in particular houses and at particular periods of a man's life. All this has to be passed over for reasons of space. 

In the Brhatsaṁhitā, the Bșhaj-jātaka, and the two works on Yātrā, Varāhamihira mentions a host of his predecessors in astrology. In my paper on Varāhamihira and Utpala' (JBBRAS, N. S. vol. 24-25, 1948-49, pp. 1–31 ) I brought together the names of all the predecessors of Varāhamihira and gave extensive references to them in his works. That paper may not be available to all readers of this volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra and therefore I propose to give a brief abstract of it here for ready reference. Purely astronomical writers or works have been generally not included in the following list : Atri ( who acc. to Br. S. 45. 1 wrote a work on utpūtas for which Garga gave him instruction, or who was the disciple of Garga); Bādarāyana 877 (named in Br. 8. 39.1) from whom about one hundred verses are quoted by Utpala in his several commentarios, in one of which on Br J. VI. 2 the view of Yavanendra on the premature death of a child is cited; Bhāguri (Bp. S. 85. 1 mentions him as an ancient author on sakunas ); Bhāradvāja (mentioned in Br. S. 85. 2 as an author on whose treatise king Dravyavardhana of Ujjayini based his own work on sakunas); Bhrgu (Bṛ. S. 85. 43 ); Cyavana (Br. Y. 29. 3); Devala (mentioned in Br, S. 7. 15 for the four motions of Mercury such as straight, retrograde and on Yogayātrā IX. 12); Devasvāmin (mentioned in Br. J. VII. 7); Dravyavardhana (mentioned as king of Ujjayini and as an author on sakunas); Garga 878 (over three hundred verses of Garga are quoted by Utpala in his commentary on Br. S. alone, a work called Mayūracitraka is ascribed to him by Utpala on Br. S 35. 3 and on Br. S. I 5 Utpala quotes three verses of Garga about Vedāngajyotisa, about his deriving astronomy from it and about other sages

Y. 29. 3); Jīvaśarman ( named in Br. J. VII. 9, XI. 1 and Utpala on XIII. 3 quotes him for the words Sunaphā, Anaphā, Durudharā and Kemadruma); Kaśyapa (in Br. Y. XIX. 1); Kāsyapa 879 ( Utpala quotes about 260 Anustubh verses from him in his commentary on Br. S. , some of which show his acquaintance with all the rāśis ); Māṇdavya (named in Br. S. 103. 3 and quoted by Utpala several times on Br. J. VI. 6, XI. 3 and 5, XIII. % and XV. 4); Maạittha (mentioned in Bṛ. J. VII, 1 along with Maya, Yavana, and Parāśara on āyurdāya, and in Bṛ. J. XI. 9, while Utpala quotes 13 Āryās and 2 Anustubh verses of his on Br. 880 J. alone); Maya (mentioned several times in Bṛ. S. 24. 2, 55. 29, 56. 8, in Br. J. VII. 1 with Yavana, Manittha and Parāśara on the topic of length of life, on Br. J. VII, 13 an āryā verse of Maya is quoted by Utpala and to Maya king of dānavas the science of Jyotisa was imparted by the Sun, as stated in the last chapter of the extant Sūryasiddhānta and in a verse quoted by Utpala on Br. S. 2.14 ); Nārada (mentioned in Bṭ. S.

S. pp. 33-40, where he assigas Garga to 50 B. C. It may be noted that though Garga is not expressly named in Br. J., he is named 15 times in Br. S. and Utpala on Br. S. 16. 41 cites a verse of Garga which clearly shows his acquaintance with the Raśi system; \# TET FIETSTEUT À FENT ET FEUTA: THEET: \# पुष्णाति परिग्रहम् ॥7. Kern states that the incomplete ms. of गार्गीसंहिता which he had secured bad almost the same titles for its chapters as Br. S. bas.

Hou may be an Indian oame also like हित्थ which occurs in the महाभाग्य on वार्तिक 5 on पाणिनि V. 1. 119. There were two Manitthas, one a contemporary of Berossus, who wrote a history of Egypt, the other, author of Apotelesmata an astrological poem in Hexameters. The Aforry whom quotes composed bis work in Sanskrit verses and is probably an Indian double, if at all, of the Greek Manitoba. Vide kern's Preface p. 52 for afurry.

VII. 1 refers to the work of Parāśara on length of life along with those of Maya, Yavana, Manittha from whom Utpala on Bṛ. J. VII, 9 quotes a verse in which Parāśara is namod, Bṛ. J. XII, 2 mentions Parāśara as having spoken of two Yogas called Srak and Sarpa); Pauliśa (vide pp. 515-517 above), almost all quotations in Utpali are on purely astronomical matters, except that on Br. J. II. 20 Utpala quotes half an ūryū of astrological character; Pitāmaha (reputed author of one of the five siddhantas, from Br. S. 1. 4 it appears that Pitāmalia regarded Tuesday as inauspicious); Ratnā vali (mentioned in Brhadyoga-yātrā II. 1 ); Rsiputra (Br. S. 48. 85 names him and then Br. S. quotes 15 verses from him, Utpala quotes about 20 Anuṣtubha verses from him on different verses of Br. S. and a long prose passage on Br. S. 85. 15 and several Anuṣtubh verses on Yogayātrā I. 15, one peculiarity being that he quotes the views of over a dozen authors such as Garga, Gautama, Dovala, Parāśara, Bphaspati ); Satya ( very frequently nanied in Br. J. such as on VII. 3, 9-11, 13, XII. 2, XX. 10, and in Brhadyog:yātrā XI. 34, about 90 ūryūs being quoted by Utpala on Br. J. alone, in Br. J.

J. VII. 1, VIII. 9, XI. 1, XXI. 3, XXVII. 19 and 21, Laghujātaka IX. 6 about Veśi, Utpala on VIII, 9 refers to Puranayavana-mata and Sārāvali 21. 11 mentions pūrvayavanendras; vide paper on 'Varāhamihira and 

Utpala' pp. 19–21 and on ‘Yavaneśvara and Utpala 'JBAS, vol. for 1957, pp. 1-5). 

The vast literature presupposed by these numerous authors cannot be compressed as said above within the brief space of a hundred years or so but requires the lapse of several centuries. From Garga, who is assigned to 50 B. C. by Kern to Varāha mihira there is a period of about five centuries which might be held to suffice for the production of this vast astrological literature. Garga himself knew the rāśi system, the system of the exaltation of planets and of dṛṣtis as the quotation in note 879 will show. Ptolemy came at least two hundred years after Garga and Firmicus four hundred years after him. Therefore there is nothing to prove that the rāśi system in India was borrowed from Greek authors. The Greeks themselves got their inspiration for horoscopic astrology from Babylon after the invasion of Alexander in 4th century B. C. and particularly after Berossus. 

It would be necessary to say something about the signs of the Zodiac. The word Zodiac is derived from a Greek word * Zodion' meaning . little animals' and means literally a circle of animals'. In Herodotus I. 70 it is used in the sense of " figuro painted or carved'. It was then applied to one of the figures imagined as formed by certain star-groups in the belt of the heavens. The Zodiac is a belt in the sky about 16 degrees broad, divided in two by the ecliptic, in which the Sun, Moon and planets move. The expression signs of the Zodiac' may be used in two senses,881 viz. (1) the 12 groups of constellations which 

881. Vide Meissner in 'Babylonian and Assyrian' vol. II. p. 406, Webb in Journal of Hellenistic studies, vol. 41 p, 72, Sarton in 'a History of Science' p. 179 gote 2. Webb in Names of stars' p. 160 points out that Crab and Scales are only 19 and 17} degrees in extent respectively, while Virgo and Fishes are respectively 48 and 41 degrees in extent in the sky. 

Senses of 'signs of zodiac' 

595 

are found sown in the vicinity of the ecliptic (the path of the Sun ) irregular in position, unequal in extent and in brightness; (2) the twelve equal artificial divisions of the belt each extending to 30 degrees of longitude It is generally held that the first meaning alone can be the earlier of the 882 two. Meissner points out that the most ancient Babylonian observation text belonging to the 37th year of Nebuchadnezzar ( 567 B. C.) knows only the figures or pictures of the constellations, while the twelve equal divisions occur first of all in a text of the reign of Darius II (about 418 B. C.). Nothing definite is known about the first formation of these picture-signs nor is it known who gave these fanciful names to stars. There is hardly any doubt that the picture names were due to popular fancy and not to men of science. The names were probably given at different times, Meissner states that the picture signs are already mentioned in part in a Hittite text of the 13th century B. C. and are also to be found on boundary stones of the same period. 

Schiaparelli in Astronomy in the old Testament' (p. 85 ) observes that in Babylonia upright stones were placed in fields as boundary marks ( Kudurru in Babylonian ) or rather as titles of property by way of public notice, of which thirty have been so far discovered on which figures are drawn and on which inscriptions are found containing most terrible curses on those who would remove the stones. On p. 86 he gives the drawing on a Babylonian monument of the 12th century B. C. in which the Moon, the Sun and Venus occupy the contral position and round about them there is a crowd of figures, of which one can easily recognize the scorpion, the goat with a fish's tail (Capricornus) and the Archer. 883 Hooke remarks that several constellations are 

882. Vide Webb in Jouroal of Hellenistic Studies vol. 48 (1925) p. 59; and Journal of Near East Studies vol. 8 pp. 6–26 by Waerden on Baby lodian Astronomy (at p. 25) in which he refers to an observation text from 6th year of Darius II (420 B, C.) containing such statements as Jupiter and Venus being at the begioning of Gemini and the like and emphasizes that Babylonian sigas were of equal length. 

883. The same figure occurs in Rawlinson's 'Five great mogarchies of the ancient world , (ed. of 1889 ) vol. II. p. 574 and that author thioks that there are the Ram, the Bull, the Scorpion, the Serpent, the Dog, the Arrow, the eagle or vulture. Vide George Smith's 'Assyrian Discoveries' (London, 1875) pp. 235-241 where he gives a figure on a boandary stone of about 1370 B. C. which records the grant of land to one Merodach Baladao and a complete English translation of the ioscription. Smith thinks (p. 237)

IIistory of Dharmaśistru (Sec. II, Ch. XVI 

assigned to Ea in the astrological texts, the two most frequently inentioned being Pisces and Aquarius and that Ea's symbol as represented on boundary stones was either Rani's head or goat-884 fish. It is stated by Frankfort 885 that of Zodiacal signs in their Babylonian forms only two, Cancer and Sagittarius, do not occur on the seals of the first dynasty of Babylonia. 

It is possible to argue that in two verses of the Rgveda (I. 24.8 and I. 164.11 ) there is a reference to the Zodiacal belt. * King Varuṇa made a wide path in order that the Sun may follow it';' the wheel of sta has twelve spokes and it again and again revolves round the sky, but it is not worn out '.886 

The above references to Babylonian boundary stones and monuments are enough to show that in Babylonia some four or five signs of the Zodiac had been distinguished before 1000 B. C. But the complete list of picture sings of the Zodiac was known in Babylonia at least from about 6th century B. C. as Meissner (referred to above ) says. 887 Sarton cautiously suggests the probability of Babylonian influence on other Oriental peoples (Iranian, Indian and Chinese) but he gives up the discussion of this question as a debatable 888 one. Authorities are agreed that the oldest horoscopes are found in Mesopotamia and not in Greece nor in Egypt. Sarton states that the first known horo scope is a cuneiform tablet in the Bodleian referring to the date 29th April 410 B. C., and that the second is another tablet in the 

 



(Continued from last page) that the figure contains the symbols of the Sun and Moon, a Scorpion, dove, winged lion, a ziggurat ( tower ). One can also detect therein a bull and a goat with fishes' tail. Waerden in Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 8 at p. 22, bolds that symbols on boundary stones are of little help and that the figure of Scorpion might first be an eartbly Scorpion considered as a symbol of a god or it might be a zodiacal Scorpion,

Cramer in ' Astrology in Roman Law and Politics' (Philadelphia, 1954) agrees with this and gives references to horoscopes of 258 B. C., 231 B. C. and 142 B. C. (pp. 5-8). Prof. Neugebauor on the other hand remarks 889 that only seven horoscopes are found preserved from Mesopotamia, all written in Seleucid period, the earliest being of 263 B. C. C. V. Maclean refers to a horoscope of 28th February 142 B. C. Sarton says that the very word 'horoscopos' was coined very late in Greece, that it is used by Manilius (first century A. D.) and Clement of Alexandria (150–220 A. D.) and that its use cannot be found earlier.890 The earliest Greek horoscope from Egypt concerns the year 4 B. C. and Prof. Neugebauer says that he knows about 60 horoscopes from 4 B. C. to 500 A. D. The earliest Demotic and Greek horoscopes were written about the beginning of the Christian era and the earliest Demotic horo scope refers to 13 A. D. 891 Prof. Neugebauer holds that the rising timos of zodiacal signs mentioned in Bșhajjātaka (I. 19) aro precisely the same as the rising times of zodiacal signs in the Babylonian system (called A.). Vide Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 7 No.. 3 pp. 100-102. 

It has been seen above that not only was general astrology developed in early Vedic times, but individual astrology based on naksatras had begun to be studied even as early as the Atharvaveda, 892, that beginnings of a regular terminology resembling the later bhūra nomenclature had been made and prognostications had been based on the naksatra of birth and on the naksatras at certain distances from the naksatra of birth. Here we have the germs of the basic assumptions of early and

medieval astrology, viz. that a person's future is determined at the time of his birth and that his destiny can be inferred from his horoscope. It will be shown immediately that India was in contact with Mesopotamia and the countries of the Near East from very ancient times. This contact became very close after Alexander's invasion of India about 325 B. C. and in the 3rd century BC. It appears to me probable that Indians who had already the naksatra astrology saw the signs of the Zodiac on Babylonian monuments and boundary stones and adapted them to their own astrological purposes just about the time when the Greeks derived their inspiration for individual astrology from Babylonians. 

In 'Gayā and Buddha Gaya' (Calcutta, 1934 ) Dr. B. M. Barua draws attention (pp. 90-92 and 121 of vol. II) to the fact that one can detect on the railing pillars at Buddha Gaya some of the motifs representing the rāśis or signs of the Zodiac (vide figures 43 a to j, which resemble the signs from Vrsa to Tulā, Dhanus and Makara). These figures were drawn in the 1st century B. C. and would go at least some way towards negativing the view of Weber and others that the rāśi system was borrowed by Indians from such Greek writers as Firmicus and Paulus in the 4th century A.D. These Buddha Gayā figures closely resemble the figures drawn on monuments and boundary stones in Babylonia (vide figures opposite ). All the railing pillars are not preserved. 

A few words may be said about the intercourse between Babylon and India. A. H. Sayce says 893 that as far back as the 3rd millennium B. C. there was cultural and possibly racial continuity between Babylon and the Punjab and the intercourse was by land and that so far there is no evidence that it was by Sea. Peacocks, rice and Indian sandalwood were known in Palestine under their Tamil names in the Hebrew chronicles of Genesis and Kings. 894 The Bogozkeui Inscription of about 1400 B. C. recording treaties between the king of Hittites and the king of Mitanni shows the dynasts of the latter people had the

Vedic gods Indra, Varuna, Mitra and Nagatya in their pan theon.895 The archives of Bogozkeui contained an elaborate treatise on four tablets on the training of horses by a certain Kikkuli of the land of Mitanni in which are found certain technical terms akin to Sanskrit; and the personal names of the kings and nobles from Mitanni, Nuzi and Syrian documents betray an Indo-European 8% origin. The Bāveru-jātaka refers to the trade by sea between Babylon and India. 897 Greek ambas sadors such as Megsthenes from Seleucus to Candragupta Maurya, Deimachus to Bindusāra ( son of Candragupta ) had been sent to India and it is not too much to hold that there was reciprocity from the Indian side and Indians bad gone as envoys to the Seleucid and Ptolemaic courts many years before Asoka sent his missionaries. 898 Aśoka's edict No. 13 refers to five kings of the Near East to whom Buddhist missionaries had been sent, viz, to

It is stated there that the works on horses composed by Kikkulis of Mitanni contain several tecbpical terms that include Indian numerals, that a treaty between the Hittite king Suppibilimas and Matbivaza of Mitanni contains the names of saveral vedic gods, and that these forms are clearly traces of the language of Indian aristocracy in the Hurrian State of Mitaani.

Antiyoga (Antiochus of Syria), Turamaya (Ptolemy II of Egypt), Antikina ( Antigonus of Macedonia), Magā ( Magas of Cyrene) and Alikasundara 899 (of Epirus). The Gospel of Matthew (chap 2.1-2 ) states that at the birth of Christ in Bethlehem wise men from the east came to Jerusalem saying that they had seen in the east the star of the newly born child and had come to worship hini. The life of Apollonius of Tyana written by Philostratus % ( in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D.) states that it was usual in India to show great hospitality to Babylonians and that the Indian king, Iarchus, presented to Apollonius seven rings named after the seven planets, of which he was to wear one on each week day. 

The theory that is sought to be propounded here is that the sight of the signs of the Zodiac on such patent objects as monuments and boundary stones in the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. excited the curiosity of Indians visiting Babylonia, that on knowing their significance they brought the knowledge back to their country and fitted it on to the naksatra astrology that already existed in India and developed the rāśi astrology in their own way. Varaha mihira expressly says about dreskānas that he describes them in accordance with the views of Yavanas. If the whole Indian astrology had been derived from the Yavanas there was nothing to prevent him from saying so. The verge ‘Mleccha hi yavanās &c.'(in note 743 above) implies that the Yavana astrological tradition and Indian one were not the same and that the Yavanas had composed Sanskrit works on astrology (as the author's two papers show). Varāha expressly differs from the Yavanas on

I p. 323, Some scholars bold that the life is a fabrication and that Apollonius never came to India. Supposing for argument that it is a fabrication, the fact remains that in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D. Pbilostratus knew that Babylonians were respected in India, that seven planets were known in India and that planets were supposed to be propitiated by the wearing of rings on appropriate week days. Charpentier wrote a booklet 

Indian travels of Apollonius of Tyaga' (Leipzig, 1934 ) in which be stated that he felt convinced that Apollonius had been in India but did not go further than the altarg of Alexander (vide · Indian Culture' vol. III. p. 2*1 for a review of Charpentier's booklet).

several substantial points. 901 About 200 B.C. the vernal equinox was at the beginning of the divisional sign Aries, which very closely coincided with the picture sign Aries. The Indian astronomers, when they began to make use of the signs Mesa and others, switched over from the reckoning with the Krttikās as the beginning of the series of naksatras on to the reckoning from the naksatra Asvinī, and counted Aśvini as the first naksatra, though the vernal equinoctial point has now receded owing to precession to the Uttarābhādrapadā naksatra group. It is difficult to trace and describe the early efforts of Indian astro logers in the centuries preceding the Christian era on the system of rāśis, since the excellent work of Varāha, the Bșhajjātaka, eclipsed all its predecessors and led to their gradual disappearance just as the two works of Ptolemy, Syntaxis (or Almagest) and Tetrabiblos, led to the gradual loss and disappearance of Greek works on astronomy and astrology composed before Ptolemy. Though all scholars maintain that Greek horoscopic astrology was influenced by Babylonian astronomy and astrology, the connecting links have snapped and become obliterated. 902 It is likely that, as both India and Greece were influenced by the Babylonian system of signs and astrology, both show somo common characteristics. But it is too wide of the mark to assert that Indian astrology as developed in Varāhamihira was borrowed from Firmicus and Paulus Alexandrinus. Prof. Neugebauer, while asserting that the Sūrya-siddhanta is based on Greek eccentric and epicyclic devices, holds that they were modified by 

901. To mention only a few striking matters of differences of opinion between Varā ba and Yavadas; (1) Yavanas favoured the view that all planets could be lords of horā (balf of a rāśi), while Br. J. said no to this (I. 11-12); (2) Yavanas held that the moon was never a malefic planet, Br. J. (11. 5) said it was so in certain cases; (3) Yavanas regarded Mars as sāttvika, while Br. J.(11. 7) held Mars to be tāmasika; (4) Yavanas held that planets could only be friends or enemies among themselves, while Br. J. (II. 15) held that they could also be neither friends nor foes ; (5) Yavanas and Varāba differed on the temporary friendship or enmity of planets (Br. J. II. 18); (6) Yavanas spoke of Vajrayoga, but Bṛ. J. (XII.3 and 6) beld that such a yoga was impossible; (7) Yavanas held that only the Kumbba dvadasamsa was inauspicious, the Br. J. (XXI. 3 ) found fault with this.

the Indians and that what he means is not that there was copying, but an intelligent modification of the initial impetus ( vide Archives Internationales D' Histoire des Sciences' for April-June 1955 ( at p. 171 and note 32). It has been shown above in note 869 that the Br. J. differs from Firmicus as to dreskānas and about bhāvas ( places in the horoscope ). My hypothesis is that Indian astrology about rāśis and bhāvas was developed before even Ptolemy. I have pointed out the differences between Ptolemy and Varāha in many places. 903 

Horoscopes are cast not only for individuals, but also for companies, ships, animals, 903a foundations of buildings, cities and countries. If a person comes to an astrologer for consulta tion on any matter, the astrologer notes the sign rising at the time the question is asked, calculates the positions of the planets also for that day and time and then makes his prognostications. 204 For casting the horoscope of an individual one must know the year, month, day, hour or ghaṭikū of birth and the place of birth. Almanacs are prepared on the basis of the latitudes and longitudes of cities like Bombay or Poona or Calcutta and they furnish tables by following which one can find the sign rising at the time of the birth of a person. But the almanacs being based on the latitudes and longitudes of certain towns and cities, if a person uses an almanac prepared in Poona for casting the horoscope of a person born in Berar or Central India there is likely to be some inaccuracy in arriving at the proper lagna.

903 a, Aldous Huxley in his novel Crome yellow' (Phoenix Library, 1929 ) satirizes society ladies who spent their days in casting the horoscopes of horses on which they laid heavy bets (p. 13). 

904. There are two well-knowo works dealing with astrology connec ted with the time of questions, viz. Sat-pañcāśikā of Pșthuyasas, son of Varāhamihira, and the Iryāsaptati of Utpala (printed by Niro. Press, Bombay). Two verses (5 and 35 ) from the first book may be quoted here: होरास्थितः पूर्णतनुः शशाङ्को जीवेन दृष्टो यदि वा सितेन। शिमं प्रणष्टस्य करोति लब्धि लाभो. Tamara 9481 T I TAHEST FUNNIESTELI HIRSEHI: nyerto 

pri uoffraigh an in verse 35 means the lagoa at the time the quese tion is asked. Verse 55 of the same is sistema zen aritu FTATI: YT: I राशिम्यः कालदिग्देशा वयो जातिश्च लग्नपात॥ ' material stolen is inferred from the pavāmsa of the lagoa at tbe time of the question, the characteristics of the thieves from dreskānas of the lagoa ( as described io Br. ). cbap. 27), from the rāsis time, direction and location are learnt and the age and caste of the thief from the lord of the lagaa'. 

Figures of horoscopes 

603 

Horoscopes are framed either in square figures or in circular figures and even as to square horoscopes, there is some variance in the practice of placing the lagna (the sign rising on the horizon at the time of birth ). Supposing the lagna is Simha, the square horoscope as usually drawn in Mahārāstra would be as follows where the figures 6, 2 and 4 would represent the 2nd, 10th and 12th bhūvus (places ), while a horoscope cast on the modern European method would be like the one next to it with the same lagna and employs symbols for the signs as for Aries and for planets such as for Mars.
