CHAPTER XVIII

Calendar, eras, various reckonings about years, months &c.

In order to be able to perform _vratas_ and celebrate _utsavas_ at the proper times and in order to find out the appropriate times for religious rites like sacrifices, upanayana and marriage people require a calendar or almanac. A calendar is a methodical combination or book about days, months and years for the purpose of registering in advance religious festivals and astronomical or astrological phenomena and for purposes of civil life. In India about thirty calendars are in use by Christians, Parsis, Moslems and Hindus. Confining oneself to Hindus there is a bewildering variety of calendars in use at present. Some are based on the data of the Sūryasiddhānta and some on those of the Aryasiddhānta, while others follow comparatively later manuals like the Grahalāghava; some begin the year with Caitra _śukla pratipad_ (or _pratipadā_), others with Kārtika śukla pratipad and there are small tracts like the Halar [^985] _prānt_ ( in Kathiawad) where the year begins with the 1st day of the bright half of Āṣāḍha. Gujarat and North India except Bengal use the Vikrama era, while the Deccan and South India generally employ the Śaka year, but Kashmir follows the _Laukika_ reckoning. In some parts (North India and Telaṅgaṇa) and communities the months are pūrṇimānta (i.e. end with Full Moon), while other parts ( Bengal, Mahārāstra and south India) follow the amānta (month ending with amāvāsyā) reckoning, The result is that some fasts and celebrations universally observed throughout India such as the Ekādaśi and Śivaratri fasts and the celebrations of the birth of Srikr̥ṣṇa are observed on two different days in different parts of the country and by different sects and there is a difference of one month between the days of some observances i.e. while on the pūrṇimānta reckoning a certain festival may be observed in Āśvina dark half, the same month may be called Bhādrapada dark half ( by amanta reckoning ) and the same festival may be celebrated one month later.

[^985]: Vide Mrs. Stevenson's 'Rites of the twice-born' p. 301 n; also I. A. vol. 18 p. 93, where it is said that the Halari year used in Halar prānt of Kathiawad and also at Amreli and Jetpur begins on Āṣāḍha śukla pratipad instead of Kārtika śukla and there is also another beginning on amanta Āṣāḍha kr̥ṣṇa 2.

The confusion is worse confounded in modern times by some calendars being what are called _Dr̥k_ or _Dr̥kpratyaya_ based on the data of the Nautical Almanac in order that such happenings as eclipses predicted in the pañcāṅga may be found to tally exactly with what is actually seen by the people. It appears that in South India there are rather too many pañcāṅgas ( calendars ). In Tamilnad there are two kinds of pañcāṅgas, one is based on _dr̥k-gaṇita_, the other is based on the Vākya method ( that follows medieval calculations based on Āryabhata which produce less accurate results). There is the Pudukoṭṭai pañcāṅga ( a Vākya one ) issued under the authority of the rājas of the principality of that name. The Sriraṅgam pañcāṅga (a Vākya one ) is used by the Srivaiṣṇavas, while followers of another Vaiṣṇava sect, the Mādhvas, have a pañcāṅga of their own. The Kanjanur pañcāṅga is the most common Vākya pañcāṅga used by the smārtas who do not use the dr̥k-ganita pañcāṅga issued under the authority of the Saṅkarācārya. The Telugus follow the Siddhānta-candra [^986] pañcāṅga based on the Grahalāghava of Ganeśa composed in śake 1442 (1520 A. D.). In Malabar the people have a dr̥k-pañcāṅga, but it is based on a revision of the old Malabar system called Parahita and is not the dṛk-pañcāṅga followed by the Tamils. The Telugus follow the Cāndra reckoning and begin their year called Yugādi from Caitra śukla, while the Tamils follow the Saura reckoning, start their Caitra with Meṣa Viṣu, though, their vratas and religious ceremonies being based on tithis, they have to follow the _Cāndra-māna_. Bengalis use solar months and lunar days with triennial adjustment by the insertion of an intercalary month.

[^986]: Warren's Kālasaṅkalita (pp. 65-69 ) publishes a skeleton of the Siddhāntacandra pañcāṅga for the 4924th luni-solar year of the Kaliyuga current (i.e. śake 1745, A, D. 1822) for the Meridian and Latitude of Madras which is mainly based on Telugu pañcāṅga, but furnishes Tamil data also.

## Siddhāntas and Karaṇas

There are three siddhāntas in use, viz. the Sūryasiddhānta (used throughout India on account of its accuracy ), the Ārya siddhānta (relied on in Travancore, Malabar, and by the Mādhvas in Karnātaka and in Tamil Districts of Madras State) and the Brāhma-siddhānta ( followed in Gujarat and Rajputana). The last, however, is losing ground in favour of the first. In the Siddhāntas calculations are made from the epoch of the _mahāyuga_ and are so elaborate that pañcāṅgas can hardly be made from them direct. Therefore, works called karaṇas based on the Siddhāntas are used to prepare pañcāṅgas, such as Makaranda in Bengal and the Grahalāghava of Gaṇeśa; the tables of the latter called Tithicintāmaṇi are used in the Deccan, Central India and some other parts of India. There are two important points of difference between the Siddhāntas among themselves viz. the length of the year ( but the difference is only of a few _vipalas_) and the second is the number of revolutions of the Moon and the planets in the Kalpa or Mahāyuga or Yuga. The Siddhāntaśiromaṇi (I 6) specifies the matters with which a siddhānta must deal, the very first of which is the enumeration of the units of time from _truti_ up to the end of _pralaya_.

It should not be supposed that India is singular in this respect. The present European calendar is also very unsatisfactory. Originally it was Julius Caesar who introduced a revised calendar in 46 B. C. with the provision that every 4th year was to be a leap year. But his calculations were not very accurate and the result was that by 1582 A.D. the spring equinox occurred on 10th March instead of on 21st March. Pope Gregory XIII declared that 4th October 1582 was to be followed by 15th October ( i.e. ten days were dropped). He further provided that century years were not to have a leap year unless they could be divided by 400 (so that years 1700, 1800, 1900 of the christian era have no additional day, but 2000 would have one). Even so, there is still a slight error, but only after more than 33 centuries one day would have to be dropped. The Gregorian year is longer by 26 seconds than the correct length of the year arrived at by modern astronomical calculations. Protestant England did not follow Pope Gregory's reform till 1750 A. D. when Acts were passed whereby 2nd of September 1752 was to be followed not by 3rd September but by 14th September ( dropping eleven days). Vide 'the Calendar New Style Act' 1750 (24 Geo. 2, chapter 23) and the Calendar Act 1751 ( 25 Geo. 2, chapter 30), which changed the year beginning from 25th March to 1st January and embodied the reforms made by Pope Gregory XIII. The European calendar is still very inconvenient. Under it a month may have from 28 to 31 days, the quarters of a year consist of 90 to 92 days; the two halves of the year (January to June and July to December ) contain respectively 181 (or 182) and 184 days, working days per month vary from 24 to 27 days and years and months begin on different week-days. Easter, the Queen of feasts, could fall even after 1751 on 35 different dates from 22nd March to 25th April, as Easter is first Sunday after the Full Moon occurring on or after 21st March.

It has been stated above (p. 480) that this work will not deal with pure astronomical questions; therefore, the author proposes to avoid going into details of astronomical computations. But something would have to be said about them as occasion requires.

## Fundamental periods of time

Among all nations the fundamental periods of time are the same, viz. the day, the month and the year (consisting of seasons). The years are the constituents of eras that are vital for chronology and history. Though the fundamental periods of time are the same, there are variations in the arrangement of days to form months and years, about the sub-divisions of the day, about the commencement of the day, about the divisions of the year among seasons and months, about the number of days in each month and in the year and about various kinds of months. The great time measurers are the Sun and the Moon. The day is due to the revolution of the earth round its axis. The month is mainly a lunar phenomenon and the year is due to the apparent motion of the Sun (but in reality it is due to the revolution of the earth round the sun). The tropical year is the time of the passage of the Sun from one vernal equinox to the next. The latter is shorter than the sidereal year (i.e. the time between the two successive arrivals of the Sun at the same fixed star ) by about 20 minutes as the vernal equinox point shifts to the west at the rate of about 50 seconds per year.[^987] A modern calendar mentions the current year ( by some era ), the month and the day of the month and generally the week-day, besides several other matters of religious and social interest. The eras and accurate knowledge of the length of the year and the month came to man rather late. The synodic month is a little over 29 1/2 days, while the tropical year is a little less than 365 1/4 days. These are incommensurable periods. For ordinary life and calendars whole days are required; besides, the starting of the year and the month must be properly defined and must correspond to seasons and some era must be used. These are the requirements of a calendar which has to be used for civil and religious purposes.

[^987]: Besides the two motions of the earth (viz, its daily revolution on its own axis and its yearly revolution round the sun) there is a third motion which is not so well-known. The earth is not a sphere, its equatorial diameter being longer than its polar diameter. The result is that there is a mass of matter bulging out at the equator which is in excess of what it would be if the earth were perfectly spherical, The earth's axis has a slight conical wobbling motion like that of a toy top and it describes a cycle in about 25800 years, the yearly shift being about 50".2 seconds, due to the pull of the sun and the moon on the equatorial bulge. This causes the appearance of the fixed stars and even the pole-star changing their positions from century to century or from period to period. Vide Sir Norman Lockyer's 'Dawn of astronomy'. pp. 124-128, Van Pep Bergh in 'Universe in Space and Time' p. 82, Hickey's 'Introducing the Universe p. 117.

The complexity of calendars is due mainly to the incommensurability of the above two astronomical periods. The Moslems solved it by ignoring the length of the tropical year and holding fast by the Moon as the measurer of time. They had a purely lunar year. The result was that the Moslems' year was of 354 days and that in about 33 years all their festivals travelled through all the months of the year. On the other hand, the ancient Egyptians ignored the moon as the measurer of time and their year was of 365 days (12 months of 30 days each plus five epagomenal, i.e. additional days). Their priests stuck to this system for 3000 years, they had no leap years or intercalary months. Most ancient peoples including Indians followed a luni-solar calendar and tried to adjust the lunar months to the solar year by the system of intercalary months. It has been seen above (p. 489 note 710 ) that even the R̥gveda speaks of an additional month (in I. 25.8) but how it was arrived at and where in the scheme of months it was introduced we do not know. We know that the Vedāṅgajyotiṣa [^988] added two months in five years. The people of those ancient times had to solve the problem of adjusting the reckoning of the months by the moon and the years by the sun. People wanted to know in advance when the Full Moon or New Moon on which many ancient festivals were celebrated may be expected, when to expect monsoon or winter, when to prepare ground for sowing and when to sow. Sacrifices had to be in spring and other seasons, as also on New Moon and Full Moon. The lunar year of 354 days was less by about 11 days than the solar year. Therefore, the seasons would shift back if the lunar year alone were observed. Hence intercalary months were introduced by several nations. The Greeks had the 'Octaeteris' (eight years cycle), that contained 99 months of which three were intercalary, viz. in the 3rd, 5th and 8th years. Then was introduced the Metonic cycle of 19 years in which occurred seven intercalary months (19 x 12 plus 7 = 235 ). Olmstead ( in American Journal of Semitic Languages, vol. 55 for 1938 ) says at p. 116 that the cycle of intercalation in Babylon was of eight years and that it was followed by the Greeks. Fotherigham (in Journal of Hellenistic studies, vol. 39 p. 179 ) says that intercalation in Babylon was irregular till 528 B. C. and in Greece it was unsystematic in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. Vide also C. R. C. Report pp. 175-176.

[^988]: Vide Lokamanya Tilak's 'Vedic chronology' pp. 21-25, Journal of Gaṅgaṇath Jha Research Institute, vol. IV. pp. 239-248 for the VedāṅgaJyotiṣa Calendar and its salient features and Pillai's 'Indian Ephemeris' Vol. I, part 1 pp. 443-456.

## Eras

The use of eras in India for calendrical purposes is not much older than about two thousand years. Continuous era reckoning first began to be employed in the records of the Indo-Scythian kings that ruled over modern Afganistan and North Western India between about 100 B. C. and 100 A. D. This is not peculiar to India; most of the ancient civilizations such as those of Egypt, Babylon, Greece and Rome did not employ a continuously running era till late in their careers. In the Jyotirvidā bharaṇa ( which is a later fabrication, though it professes that it was finished in _gatakali_ 3068 i. e. 33 years before the christian era ) mentions the names of six persons as the founders of eras in Kaliyuga, viz. Yudhiṣṭhira, Vikrama, Śālivāhana, Vijayābhinandana, Nāgārjuna, Kalkin [^989] and states that their eras respectively last for 3044, 135, 18000, 10000, 400000, 821 years. In ancient [^990] countries no continuous era was used, but only regnal years were employed. In India also Aśoka employs only regnal years in his edicts (e. g the 4th pillar edict at Lauriya nandana-garh and the 5th pillar edict at Rāmpurvā, C.I.I. vol. I pp. 147, 151, were engraved in the 26th year of his kingship ). Kauṭilya [^991] also, when setting forth the business of the collector of revenue specifies the times with which the collector would be concerned as 'the royal year, the month, the fortnight, the day &c.' This practice continued even under the Kuṣaṇas and Śātavāhanas; vide Lūder's list in E.I. X, No. 22, 32 for Kaniṣka, No. 1024 (Kanheri cave Inscription of Gotamiputa-sāmi-Siriyaña Sātakaṇi), No. 1100 and 1122 ( Karle and Nasik cave inscriptions of Vāsiṭhīputa Siri-Pulumāvi). The Kaliṅga king Khāravela (generally assigned to the 2nd century B. C.) uses only regnal years and no era ( vide E. I. vol. 20 p. 71 at pp. 79-80 ).  

[^989]: युधिष्ठिरो विक्रमशालिवाहनौ नराधिनाथो विजयाभिनन्दनः । इमे नु नागार्जुनमेदिनीविभुर्बलिः क्रमात् षट् । शककारकाः कलौ ॥ Some read कल्की षडेते for बलि: &c  Vide Z. D. M. G. vol. 22 p. 717 verse 110, Fleet in JRAS for 1911 p. 694 for variant readings in this verse, Poona Orientalist vol. V pp. 205–209 on 'Jyotirvidābharaṇa and the Nine Jewels' by K. Mādhava Krishna Sarma for other readings and date.

[^990]: Vide Fotheringham in Explanation to Nautical Almanac for 1935 at p. 755 about Egyptians not using a continuous era, but being content to number the years of each reign separately.

[^991]: राजवर् मासाः पक्षो दिवसश्च न्युष्टं वर्षाहेमन्तग्रीष्माणां तृतीयसप्तमा दिवसोनाः पक्षाः शेषाः पूर्णाः पृथगधिमासक इति कालः।  Arthaśāstra II. 6 p. 60. This passage is variously interpreted by Fleet, Sham Sastri aod others. The difficulty is due to the word 'vyuṣṭa', which literally means 'daybreak or light' and here means 'the first day of the year which is deemed to be very auspicious.' Vide 'तत्र च दीयते कार्यं भववत् । व्युष्टादिभ्योऽण् ।। पा. V. 1 96-97, To the author it appears that this passage means 'the royal (or regnal) year, month, fortnight, day, the auspicious (first day of the year ), the third and seventh fortnights of the three seasons viz, rain, winter, summer have one day less (than thirty), the other fortnights are full (i.e, months have full 30 days each ), an intercalary is a separate (period of time) - these are the times (the collector of revenue has to note). In ancient times, the year had six seasons, twelve months and 30 days in each month, The Arthaśāstra here says that there were six fortnights of 29 days each and so the (lunar year was of 354 days). In order to bring it in line with the solar year an intercalary month had to be resorted to.

A variety of eras have been used in India for hundreds of years; this has created a great deal of confusion in chronology and history. For the lists of eras now in use or met with in inscriptions and Sanskrit literature, vide Cunningham on Indian eras, 'Indian Ephemeris' by Swamikannu Pillai vol. I part 1 pp. 53-55, V. B. Ketkar's 'Indian and foreign chronology' pp. 171–172; P. C. Sen-Gupta in ' Ancient Indian eras'(pp. 222-238) and Dr. Saha's paper in ' Science and Culture'for 1952 (Calcutta) at p. 116 that gives a table of eras with the starting year of the eras, their current years, year beginnings (solar and luni-solar), lunar month end, provenance &c. Vide also p. 258 of the C.R.C. Repost ( Table 27 ) for a similar long list of eras. In this work only a few eras of importance will be briefly dealt with. Alberuni (Sachau vol. II, p. 5) names five eras, viz of Śri Harsha, Vikramāditya, Śaka, Valabha and Gupta. He gives two different versions about the first and leaves the question undecided.

Differing views were held even in ancient times, as to when the Kaliyuga [^992] started and what event the Kaliyuga era commemorates. At present the Kaliyuga era is supposed to have started in 3102 B. C. and a past Kaliyuga year is to be arrived at by adding 3101 to the A. D. years.

[^992]: Vide JRAS for 1911 pp. 479-96 and 675-698 (Dr. Fleet), H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 896-902 for discussions about the Kaliyuga beginning. In 'Ancient Indian chronology' Prof. Sen-Gupta after a lengthy and somewhat vehement argument concludes that the date of the Bharata battle is 2449 B. C. and that the year 3102 B.C. for it is wrong (p. 1-59). Vide C.R.C. Report pp. 252-254 for Kaliyuga era. It may be noted that Janamejaya, son of Parikṣit, is mentioned as the performer of an Aśvamedha sacrifice in Śat: Br. XIII. 5.4. Whether he is the same as the Mahābhārata hero is more than one can say, but it is not unlikely that he is the same.

## Beginning of Kaliyuga era

There are four principal views about the starting point, viz. (1) the starting point is when Yudhiṣṭhira ascended the throne; (2) it is 36 years later when Yudhiṣṭhira crowned as king Parikṣit, the grandson of Arjuna; (3) according to the Puraṇas [^993] Kaliyuga started when Kṛṣṇa passed away (vide Viṣṇupuraṇa IV. 24. 108 to 113);(4) According to [^993a]  to Varāhamihira, 2426 years prior to the starting of Śaka-kāla, Yudhiṣṭhira era started i.e. 653 years after the start of Kaliyuga according to the 2nd view. The Aihole inscription appears to follow the 2nd view, since it equates [^994] 556 śaka year with 3735 Kaliyuga year (past). One of the earliest references to the Kaliyuga era is that by Āryabhaṭa who states that he was twenty-three years old when 3600 years of Kaliyuga had expired (i. e. he was born in 476 A. D.).[^995] There is an early Cola record dated 4044 of the Kaliyuga era (i. e. 943 A. D.). Vide JRAS for 1911 pp. 689-694 for several instances of the employment of Kaliyuga era in inscriptions. Medieval Indian astronomers believed that all planets (including the sun and the moon) were together at sunrise on Sunday of Caitra śukla pratipad at the beginning of Kaliyuga and also of Kalpa.[^995a] It is suggested by modern writers like Burgess and Dr. Saha that this epoch was arrived at by astronomical calculations carried back-ward at a late period and is a mere fiction (vide p. 253 of the C. R.C. Report).

[^993]: यस्मिन् कृष्णो दिवं यातस्तस्मिन्नेव तदाहनि । प्रतिपन्नं कलियुगमिति प्राहुः पुराविदः॥ भागवत XII 2. 33; compare वायु 99. 428-~429, मत्स्य 273.49-50, विष्णुपु. IV. 24. 110, ब्रह्माण्ड III. 74.241 for similar verses.

[^993a]: आसन्मधासु मुनयः...शककालस्तस्य राज्ञश्च ॥ बृहत्संहिता 13.3 quoted in note 746. This is followed by कल्हण in his राजतरङ्गिणी I. 51 'शतेषु षट्सु सार्धेषु इयधिकेषु च भूतले । कलेर्गतेषु वर्षाणामभूवन् कुरुपाण्डवाः ॥

[^994]: त्रिंशत्सु त्रिसहस्रेषु भारतादाहवादितः । सप्ताब्दशतयुक्तेषु गतेष्वन्देषु पञ्चसु ॥ पञ्चाशत्सु कलौ काले षट्सु पञ्चशतासु च । समासु समतीतासु <u>शकानामपि भूभुजाम् </u>॥ E. I. vol. VI at p. 7. Apparently here कलियुग is deemed to have started immediately after the Bhārata War. Later astronomical works hold that the śaka era began when 3179 years of Kali era had expired; vide 'याताः षण्मनवो युगानि भमितान्यन्यद्युगाङ्घ्रित्रयं नन्दाद्रीन्दुगुणास्तथा <u>शकनृपस्यान्ते </u> कलेर्वत्सराः । सिद्धान्तशिरोमणि I. 28. नन्दाद्रीन्दुगुणाः is equal to 3179 (नन्द = 9, अदि = 7, इन्दु = 1, गुण = 3).

[^995]: षष्टयब्दानां षष्टिर्यदा व्यतीतास्त्रयश्चं युगपादाः । त्र्यधिका विंशतिरब्दास्तदेह मम जन्मनोऽतीताः॥ आर्यभटीय, कालक्रियापाद verse 10 (ed. Kera).

[^995a]: लङ्कानगर्यामुदयाच्च भानोस्तस्यैव वारे प्रथमं बभूव । मधोः सितादेर्दिनमासवर्ष युगादिकानां युगपत् प्रवृत्तिः॥ ग्रहगणित, मध्यमाधिकार verse 15 (of भास्कराचार्य); चैत्रसितादेरुदयाद् भानोर्दिनमासवर्षयुगकल्पाः । सृष्टयादौ लङ्कायां समं प्रवृत्ता दिनेर्कस्य ॥ ब्राह्म स्फुटसिद्धान्त I. 4.

It is rather difficult to hold that this was all pure imagination on the part of the ancient Siddhānta writers; it is more probable that they had a persistent tradition of long standing before them. [^995b].

In the _Saṅkalpa_ (declaratory formula) for every religious ceremony the performer has to mention the grand divisions and sub-divisions of time beginning with Śvetavārāhakalpa, such as Vaivasvata manvantara, Kaliyuga and its first quarter together with the geographical position of the place of performance in Bharatavarṣa, and the Zodiacal signs occupied by the Sun, Jupiter and other planets, the era, name of year (Jovian), the month, the fortnight, the tithi, nakṣatra, Yoga and Karaṇa. A verse of Devala states that if a man performing a religious rite does not mention the month, the fortnight, the tithi and the occasion (of the rite ) he will not reap the merit of the rite.[^996] That is the importance of eras, years and its sub-divisions in the religious life of our people. Therefore a calendar (_pañcāṅga_) is absolutely necessary for every religious Hindu.

[^995b]: Vide E.I. vol. VIII p. 261. In E.I. vol. 28 p. 63 there are plates of Arkeśvara-deva dated in _yugābda_ 4248 (i.e, in Kaliyuga era), corresponding to 6th February 1148 A.D. Vide also a paper contributed to 'Annals of Science', vol. 8 No. 3 ( 1952) pp. 221-228 by Prof. Neugebauer and Dr. O. Schmidt on 'Hindu Astonomy at Newminster in 1428', in which reference is made to an anonymous treatise composed in England at Newminster containing astronomical calculations for the year 1428 and for the latitude of Newminster. That treatise quotes several Arabic authorities, among which is one 'Omer' (or Umar, who died about 815 A. D.) and the treatise remarks that Alfonso began the year of the Flood on February 16, 3102 years before the Incarnation, a date which is obviously identical with the beginning of the Kaliyuga era (employed by Indian astronomers ).

## Vikrama era, Kṛta era and Mālavagaṇa era

The origin and use of the Vikrama era are as much shrouded in doubts and mystery as is the case with the śaka era.[^997] Doubts have been expressed as to whether there was any king called Vikramāditya about 57 B. C. the supposed starting point being [^998] Nov. 58 B. C. in Gujarat where the year begins with Kārtika _śukla_ pratipad and April 58 B.C. in Northern India where the year begins with Caitra kṛṣṇa pratipad. The expired Vikrama year is equal to A. D. year plus 57. In certain rather early inscriptions, years are referred to as Kr̥ta. For example, in Nandsa Yūpa Inscription the Kr̥ta year 282 is mentioned and in three Maukhari Inscriptions on _yūpas_ (sacrificial posts ) the year 295 Kr̥ta is found.[^999] The Bijayagad pillar Inscription is dated in Kr̥ta 428, the Mandasor Inscription in Kṛta 461 and the Gaṅgadhar Inscription in Kr̥ta 480. [^1000] Scholars are generally agreed that the Kr̥ta era is a precursor of the Vikrama era. But the name Kr̥ta applied to the years has not been satisfactorily explained. [^1001]

[^998]: K. P. Jayaswal ( I. A. vol. 47 p. 112 and I, A 46 pp. 145–153 ) holds that Vikrama was historical, ended the rule of Nahapāna-Śakendra in 58 B. C, and belonged to the Sātavāhana family.

[^1001]: Vide Bombay University Journal vol. 17 pp. 19-25 where Prof. K. B. Vyas puts forward the rather novel theory that the word _Kr̥ta_ in the ancient Inscriptions refers to the Kaṭha people and J. of Indian History vol. 24 (for 1945 ) pp 105-109, where Prof. D. N. Mookerjee mentions nine Inscriptions in the Kr̥ta or Mālava-gaṇa era and contends that Kṛta is the era started by Kalkin who is supposed to have ushered in the Kr̥ta-yuga in the 5th century B. C. The author does not agree with both these views. Prof. Sen-Gupta in 'Ancient Indian Chronology' pp. 238 ff. holds that the Kṛta eta started in 63 B, C. His grounds are that certain Mahābhārata and Pauraṇic passages set out in a prophetic vein the circumstances when Kr̥ta-yuga will start and he holds that those conditions were satisfied about 63 B. C. and therefore the era was called Kr̥ta. In the first place the passages refer to a future date. No one thought in ancient India that the start of the Kṛta age was near. Besides, one of the passages on which he relies is Mahābhārata, Vanaparva 190. 90-91 ( of the Bombay edition) and 188 87 (of the critical BORI edition) and is differently read in the Śāradā Codex and several Kāśmir Mss. viz. as यदा चन्द्रश्च सूर्यश्च तथा तिष्यबृहस्पती। एकरात्रे समेष्यन्ति प्रपत्स्यति तदा कृतम् ॥ and not एकराशौ as he reads. Therefore this verse is hardly of use for chronological purposes. Besides Vāyu 99. 413 also reads ekarātre (only one Ms. reads 'ekarāśau'). Some Puraṇas like Viṣṇu IV, 24, 102. Brahmāṇḍa III 74, 225 no doubt read एकराशौ. The three Matsya-purāṇa verses he quotes are not from the same chapter. The first verse simply says that Viṣṇu created _Yavas_ on 3rd tithi of Vaiśākha bright half and that he started Kr̥tayuga on that tithi. It is impossible to draw any definite date from this verse by itself. The other two verses are Matsya 65, 2-3. They describe a vrata and fast on 3rd tithi of the bright half of Vaiśākha, which yield inexhaustible fruits to the performer, equal to all good deeds. If on that tithi when joined to Kṛttikā one does special worship, whatever is donated or offered in the fire and whatever mantras are recited become inexhaustible. These two verses contain not a word about Kr̥tayuga and the first says nothing about Kṛttikā. It is, to say the least, a strange method to put together verses apart from their context and aver that a particular date has been established.

Some inscriptions are also dated in the era of the Mālava-gaṇa (Malava tribe ), as e. g. the Mandasor [^1002] Inscription of Naravarman. The Kṛta and Mālava era are held to be identical and the inscriptions so far discovered as dated in these two eras are found in eastern Rajasthan and Western Malva. It is further to be noted that, whereas we have inscriptions in 282 and 295 of the Kr̥ta year, no inscription of the Mālava era has yet been found that is dated so early. It is possible that Kr̥ta is the earlier name and when the Mālavas adopted the same era it came to be called 'Malava-gaṇāmnāta' or 'Mālava-gaṇa-sthiti.' But it may be remarked that if Kr̥ta and Mālava both refer to what later became the Vikrama era, they were both being used concurrently for at least one nundred years, as we have the Kṛta era 480 and also the Mālava era year 461.

[^1002]: Vide I. A. vol. 42 (1913 ) p. 161-163 for Mandasor Inscription of Naravarman which is dated the 5th of the bright half of Āśvoja of the Mālava year 461 ( 404 A.D.) as traditionally handed down by the Mālava tribe ( Mālavagaṇāmnāta). The important verse is : श्रीमालवगणाम्नाते प्रशस्ते कृतसंज्ञिते। एकषष्टयधिके प्राप्ते समाशतचतुष्टये ॥ In the Mandasor Pillar Inscription of Yaśodharman occur the words 'मालवगणस्थितिवशात्कालज्ञानाय लिखितेषु'। (year 589 of Mālava era); vide Gupta Ins. No. 35 at p. 154). On मालवगणस्थिति, vide Prof. Shembavnekar in J. I, H, vol. X pp. 143-155, where (on p. 145) he holds that 'gaṇasthiti' is equal to gaṇadāpaddhati'. His arguments though plausible are not correct. There should be contemporary authority (of the 5th or 6th century A. D.) for 'gaṇa' meaning 'gaṇanā'. In the Bijaygadh stone Ins. (Gupta Ins. No, 58 p. 251 ) we come across the words 'यौधेयगणपुरस्कृतस्य महाराजमहासेनापतेः &c.'. Therefore 'Mālava-gaṇasthiti' should really mean 'the usage of the Mālavagaṇa' and मालवगणाम्नातः should mean 'as traditionally handed down among the Mālavagaṇa'. Besides a  'Mālavagaṇa-viṣaya' mentioned in the Nandsa Yūpa inscription edited in E. I., vol. 27, p. 252 at p. 259 makes it almost certain that 'Mālavagaṇa' means 'Mālava tribe' and nothing else.

## The Vikrama era

The author does not think it possible that the word Kr̥ta was applied to the era because it was believed at its foundation that the Kr̥ta-yuga had started. It is possible that Kr̥ta has the same meaning as _siddha_ (just as krtānta means siddhānta ) and it indicates that it was established by agreement among certain people. The Vikrama era is specifically mentioned by name only from about 8th or 9th century A. D. [^1002a] Besides, the Vikrama era has hardly ever been employed in Sanskrit astronomical works and it is generally desiganted _saṁvat_ to distinguish it from the śaka era. The Yeḍarāve Inscription of Cālukya Vikramāditya VI shows that that king superseded the śaka era and started a Cālukya Vikrama era the first year of which was 1076-77 A. D. Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 1 part 2 p. 447 and 477 (and I, A. VII pp. 61-56 for reference to 400 śakakāla 1478 A. D.).

Almost all astronomical works in Sanskrit from about 500 A. D. employ the Śaka era. Why the Śaka era is so called, whether it was to commemorate the coming of the famous Kuṣāṇa king Kaniṣka to the throne or when and where it came to be first used are among the most difficult and unsolved problems of Indian History and Chronology. In one of the earliest inscriptions expressly dated in the Śaka era, viz. that of Cālukya king Maṅgaleśvara in 500 śaka (expired, i. e, 578 A.D.) it is cited as the era of the crowning of the Śaka [^1003] king. Varāhamihira speaks of it as Śakakāla ( in the Pañcasiddhāntikā [^1004] and Br̥hat-saṁhitā 13.3) and as Śakendrakāla or Śakabhūpakāla (in Br̥hat-saṁhita VIII. 20-21 ). Utpala ( about 966 A. D.) while commenting on Bṛhat-saṁhitā (VIII. 20 ) remarks that the Śaka era started from the time when the Śaka king was killed by Vikramāditya.

[^1002a]: Vide I A. vol. 12 p. 155 the Dhiniki Grant of King Jāikadeva of Saurāṣṭra of the Vikrama year 794 ( 737 A D.) 'विक्रमसंवत्सरशतेषु सप्तसु चतुर्नवत्यधिकेषु अङ्कतः ७९४ कार्तिकमासापरपक्षे अमावास्यायां आदित्यवारे ज्येष्ठानक्षत्रे रविग्रहणपर्वणि &c.

[^1004]: सप्ताश्विवेदसंख्यं शककालमपास्य चैत्रशुक्लादौ । अर्धास्तमिते भानौ यवनपुरे सोमदिवसाद्ये ॥ पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका I.8, which means 'deducting śaka year 427 (from the śaka year for which ahargaṇa is required) at the beginning of the bright half of _caitra_ when the sun has half set in Yavapapura at the beginning of Monday.' Since Varāha employs in his several works the words शककाल, शकेन्द्रकाल and शकभूपकाल as synonyms it cannot be gainsaid that to him at least Śakakāla has something to do with śaka kings. One regrets that since independence some Indian scholars are bent upon not admitting patent facts of history and put forward novel theories. The verse 'आसन्..राज्ञश्च' in note 746 does not stand by itself and has to be taken along with the other verses in the same work (as in Br. S. VIII. 20-21 ) and शकेन्द्रकाल in पञ्चसिद्धान्तिका (vide note 1008); the verse 'आसन् &c.' says that śaka years when added to by 2526 (or 2566) represeat the time of Yudhiṣṭhira. The suggestion made by some that śakakāla simply means method of reckoning cannot be accepted in view of the words Śakendrakāla or Śakabhūpakāla. One may raise a dispute as to whether the śaka era was founded by a _śaka king_ or whether it was _founded by an Indian king_ who defeated the Śakas. But the central fact remains that śaka-kāla has something to do with the Śakas and a Śaka king.

Its years begin with Caitra for luni-solar reckoning and Meṣa for solar reckoning. Its years are generally expired ones and it begins with vernal equinox of 78 A. D. The earliest inscription so far discovered in which the śaka era is expressly mentioned is that of Cālukya Vallabheśvara dated in 465 śaka (i. e. 543 A. D. )[^1005] The inscriptions of the Kṣatrapa kings that bear the number of the year but no era are generally ascribed to the śaka era, e.g. those of Rudradāman in 52 and 72; of Rudrasiṁha in 103, of Rudrasena in 122 ( Lūder's list Nos. 965, 963, 962). Emperor Kaniṣka (of the Kusāṇa race ) is also connected by some with the foundation of the śaka era. [^1006] One of the earliest date for the śaka era in literature is mentioned as śaka 380 in the Jain work Lokavibhāga of Siṁhasūri. [^1007] As the Pañcasiddhāntikā (XII. 2) takes the 2nd year of the śaka era as the epoch of the Pitāmaha siddhānta, it is not too much to assume that the original siddhānta of which a summary is given by Varāhamihira was composed according to him in the first quarter of the first century of the śaka era.

## The śaka era

In later medieval and modern times (as also in the Jyotirvidābharaṇa ) the śaka era goes by the name of Śālivāhana. But the form Śālivāhana as that of the era occurs only in the inscriptions of the 13th or 14th century A. D. e. g. the two earliest inscriptions so far discovered mentioning the word Śālivāhana are those recorded in the plate of Devagiri Yadava king Kṛṣṇa dated in Śālivāhana era 1172 (1251 A. D. ) [^1009] and the plate of Bukka I dated in śaka 1276, current (1354 A. D.). Vide No. 455 in Kielhorn's list in E. I. VII. It is possible that the name Śātavāhana ( mentioned in Harṣa-carita as the composer of the Gāthāsaptaśati) was changed into Sālavāhana, then into Śālivāhana and this conjecture is supported by the fact that in the Gathāsaptaśati ( V. 67 ) king Sālāhaṇa (a Prakrit form of Sātavāhana ) is mentioned; 'only two know how to raise high distressed families (by _śleṣa_, the family of Aparṇā ), viz. Śiva beloved of the heart of Gauri or the king Sālāhaṇa ( Sātavāhana ).' Vide C. R. C. Report pp. 241-256 for the śaka era and Ludwig Bachhofer's paper on 'Greeks and Śakas in India ' in J. A. O. S. vol. 61 (1941 ) pp. 223-250, where he attacks some of the downright and very emphatic assertions of Dr. W. W. Tarn in the Greeks in Bactria and India.'

Another era, which is current even now in Kashmir, is the Saptarṣi era, also called Laukika era. According to the Rājataraṅgiṇī the Laukika year 24 was equal to śaka [^1070] (expired).[^1009a] In the use of that era the centuries are generally omitted. It is a luni-solar era supposed to have begun in April 3076 B.C. on the first day of Caitra-śukla. Vide Cunningham's 'Indian eras' pp. 6–17 and Stein's Introduction to translation of the Rājataraṅgiṇi pp. 58 ff. The Br̥hatsaṁhitā [^1010] notes a tradition that the Saptarṣis (Ursa Major) occupy each nakṣatra for a hundred years and that they occupied the constellation of Maghā when king Yudhiṣṭhira reigned. Probably this is the origin of the Kashmir era in cycles of one hundred years. For Inscriptions dated in the Laukika era, vide Bhandarkar's list No. 1431-1443 in E. I. vol. 20 Appendix and No. 1444-45 for Saptarṣi era.

[^1009]: Vide Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, vol. 17 pp. 92-93 (Dr. Gai's paper ).

[^1009]: लौकिकेऽब्दे चतुर्विंशे शककालस्य साम्प्रतम् । सप्तत्याम्यधिकं यातं सहस्रं परिवत्सराः ॥ राजतरङ्गिणी 1. 52.

Several other eras such as the Vardhamāṇa and Buddhanirvāṇa eras, Gupta, Cedi, Harṣa, Laksamaṇa-sena ( in Bengal), Kollam or Paraśurāma era (prevelent in Malabar ), most of which were once in great vogue ( at least in civil life ) but are now practically unused, are passed over here, as of only academic interest in these days. For Vardhamāna nirvāṇa era, vide I. A. vol. 25 p. 346 where the year 2493 after the nirvana of Vardha māna is said to be equal to Vikrama year 1888 and śaka year 1752 (1830 A. D.) and Buddha-nirvāṇa era in JRAS for 1875 at p. 358 ( a Ceylonese Inscription of Sāhasa-malla's time about 1191 A. D.), where mention is made that the king was crowned 1743 years, three months and 27 days after the _nirvāṇa_ of Buddha. Great controversies have raged over the Gupta era (which Fleet holds began in 319 A. D.). There are some who hold that it is really the Vikrama era (J. I. H. vol. 17 p. 293 ff and J. I. H. special number of March and April 1941 pp. 71-84 ). For Harṣa era, vide E. I. 19 p. 52 and Nos. 1385–1421 in Bhandarkar's list in vol. 20 Appendix of E. I. From Alberuni (Sachau vol. II, p. 5) it appears that Harṣa era started in 606 A.D. There has been some conflict of views on this; vide ]HQ vol. 27 pp. 321 ff, vol. 28 p. 280 ff (by R.C. Majumdar) and vol. 29 pp. 72-79 (Dr. D. C. Sirkar). The Kollam era is said to have started in 1176 B. C.

It has already been shown how in Vedic works the year was denoted by several synonyms such as saṁvatsara, samā, varṣa.

## Nine kinds of time reckonings

In the Nārada-saṁhitā [^1011] it is said that there are nine kinds of reckonings of time, viz. Brāhma ( of Brahmā), Daiva ( of the gods ), Mānuṣa (human ), pitr̥ya ( of the Pitr̥s), Saura, Sāvana, Cāndra, Nākṣatra and Bārhaspatya, but that in ordinary wordly matters only five of these are employed. The Vedāṅga-jyotiṣa appears to refer to four when it says that in a _yuga_ (of five years) there are 61 _sāvana_ months, 62 lunar months, 67 nākṣatra months, Hemādri ( on Kāla, p. 9) dwells on only three of these year reckonings, viz. cāndra, saura, and sāvana, while Mādhava ( in Kālanirṇaya-kārikās 11-12 ) speaks of two more, viz. Nākṣatra and Bārhaspatya. The Viṣṇudharmottara speaks of four (not mentioning Bārhaspatya ). The three mentioned by Hemādri are those most employed in religious and civil matters, and dharmaśāstra works are specially concerned with them, while the other two are rarely referred to in the latter. A cāndra month [^1012] is a time period from the end of one amāvāsyā (New Moon ) to the next amāvāsyā and twelve such months make the cāndra year of 354 days. It is also called a lunation. The length of a cāndra month varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days owing to the eccentricity of the moon's orbit and other causes and its average period is 29.53059 days. A saura month is the time taken by the sun to move through one sign of the zodiac; twelve such months constitute the solar year, [^1013] and the first day of a solar year is the first day of the Saura month, Meṣa.

[^1011]:  ब्राह्यं देवं मानुषं च पित्र्यं सौरं च सावनम् । चान्द्रमार्क्षं गुरोर्मानमिति मानानि वै नव । एषां तु नवमानां व्यवहारोऽत्र पञ्चभिः । तेषां पृथक् पृथक् कार्यं वक्ष्यते व्यवहारतः॥ नारदसंहिता III. 1-2. (Chowkhamba S. Series). कल्प (to be explained later) is a day of Brahmā (Sūryasiddhānta I. 20); one human year was supposed to be a day of the gods (एकं वा एतद् देवानामहो यत्संवत्सरः । ते. ब्रा. III. 9. 22. 1); one human month was held to be the _ahorātra_ of pitr̥s (मनु. I. 66). मानुषमान is विमिश्र (mixed) because men employ four reckonings (_māna_), for different purposes as stated in the सि.शि. I 30-31 (ज्ञेयं विमिश्रं तु मनुष्यमानं मानैश्चतुर्भिर्व्यवहारवृत्तेः। वर्षायनर्तुयुगपूर्वकमत्र सौरान्मासास्तथा च तिथयस्तुहिनांशुमानात् । यत्कृच्छ्रसूतकचिकित्सितवासराद्यं तत्सावनाच्च घटिकादिकर्माक्षमानात्॥). But the सि.शि. further on (I. 32) says that computations about planets are to be made by human reckoning (ग्रहास्तु साध्या मनुजैः स्वमानात्).

[^1012]:  नाडीषष्टया तु नाक्षत्रमहोरात्रं प्रकीर्तितम् । तत्त्रिंशता भवेन्मासः सावनोऽर्कोदयैस्तथा ॥ ऐन्दवस्तिथिभिस्तद्वत् संक्रान्त्या सौर उच्यते। सू. सि. I. 12-13; दर्शावधिं चान्द्रमुशन्ति मासं सौरं तथा भास्करराशिभोगात् । त्रिंशद्दिनं सावनसंज्ञमाहुर्नाक्षत्रमिन्दोर्भगणभ्रमाञ्च॥ रत्नमाला I. 20, वायुपुराण 50. 187-88, विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 72. 14-20 (q. by हे. on काल p. 10) and उत्पल on बृहज्जातक VIII. 10 mention the four reckonings चान्द्र, सौर, सावन and नाक्षत्र and their employment for certain purposes.

[^1013]: The वेदाङ्गज्योतिष (which is in two recensions, attached to Ṛgveda and Yajurveda respectively) summarizes the several items of the saura year as follows :-त्रिशत्यह्नां सषट्षष्टिरब्दः षट् चर्तवोयने। मासा द्वादश सौराः स्युरेतत्पश्चगुणं युगम् ॥  वेदाङ्गज्योतिष verse 31 (Sbam Shastri, ed.). The Vedāṅga-jyotiṣa holds that 366 days constitute a year. The modern Sūrya-siddhānta says that there are 365.258756 days in a year. The other siddhāntas slightly vary from this. According to modern astronomy the year consists of 365'242196 days. Vide 'Indian Culture' vol. VIII. pp. 114-116 for a note on this ( by N. C. Lahiri) and Preface p. VIII, aod p. 240 of the (C. R. C. Report.). For the length of Jupiter's revolution round the sun, vide 'Frontiers of Astronomy' p. 47 by D. S. Evans. The meaning of the above verses is: a solar year contains 366 days, it has six r̥tus (seasons) and two _ayanas_, twelve months; these multiplied five times make a _yuga_.' It does not profess to be a treatise on astronomy as then known, but its aim was a thoroughly practical one viz, to enable the Vedic priest having some knowledge of elementary arithmetic but not knowing astronomy to determine a required _tithi_ (age of the moon ) and the place (nakṣatra) of the moon and the sun on a particular day in the _yuga_ of five years.

If the entry of the sun into the sign is in the day time then that day is the first day of the month. If the entry is in the night, the next day is the first day of the month. The time of entry of the sun into a rāśi differs from almanac to almanac and the result is that the entry may be before sunset in one almanac and after sunset in another. Therefore, there may be the difference of one day as to the first day of the month. Owing to the adoption of different ayanāṁśas and the difference in the length of the year, the Dṛk, Vākya and Siddhānta almanacs may differ about the first day of the year, about Poṅgal and other festivals. Sāvana year is of 12 months of 30 days each, the day being counted from one sunrise to the next. A nākṣatra month is the time taken by the moon to pass through the 27 nakṣatras; the Bārhaspatya year is the time taken by Jupiter to pass through one sign of the zodiac (i.e. about 361 days). According to modern astronomy, Jupiter takes 11.86 years (for its revolution round the sun). All these four or five divisions are not mentioned in early works and even in later days all these four divisions do not appear to have been fully utilised, though mentioned in astronomical and dharmaśāstra works. Kauṭilya provides that[^1014] the month for workmen is of thirty days and nights, the Saura month is one half day larger i.e. (30 days in a month ), the lunar month a half day less (i.e. 29 1/2 days ), the nākṣatra month is of 27 days, the intercalary month is of 32 days (or occurs in the 32nd month? ), the month is of 35 days (for the wages) of those who tend horses and of 40 days for those who are keepers of elephants. The month for workmen was of 30 days, but it need not have coincided with Full Moon or New Moon, while lunar months end with amāvāsyā or pūrnimā. The Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta quoted by Utpala on Bṛhat-saṁhita II. 4 p. 40 provides that from the saura reckoning one derives the extent of Yuga, the year, Viṣuvat, Ayana, seasons, the increase and decrease in the length of the day and night; from the cāndra the details about tithis, _karaṇas_, intercalary month or _kṣaya_ month, all acts to be performed at night; from _sāvana_ reckoning sacrifices, the _sāvanas_ (the three soma libations ) the motions of planets, fasts, impurities on birth and death, medical treatment, expiations and other religious rites. Vide Viṣṇudharmottara I. 72.26-27 for similar verses.

[^1014]: त्रिंशदहोरात्रः प्रकर्ममासः । सार्धसौरः ( सार्धः सौरः ? ) । अर्धन्यूनश्चान्द्रमासः । सप्तविंशतिर्नक्षत्रमासः । द्वात्रिंशद्मलमासः । पञ्चत्रिंशदश्ववाहायाः । चत्वारिंशद्धस्तिवाहायाः । अर्थशास्त्र II. 20p. 108. The महाभाष्य on वार्तिक 2 on पा. IV. 2. 21 mentions a भूतकमास ( month of hired service), which seems to be the same as प्रकर्ममास.

## What māna governs what purposes

At present the year begins either in caitra or kārtika in different parts of India. But in ancient times it began in different months in different countries and for different purposes. Many Vedic [^1015] passages show that the reckoning was pūrṇimānta, that the year began after the Full moon of Phālguna and that Vasanta was the first season of the year. It is due to this that Mādhava says in his Kāla-nirṇaya p. 63 (Calcutta ed.) that Śruti (Veda ) is insistent on the pūrṇimānta month (paūrṇamāsyantatve śruteḥ kaṭākṣo bhūyān). The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 377) notes that the _amānta_ reckoning is followed in Deccan the (Dakṣiṇā-patha ) and pūrṇimānta in North India (Uttara-patha). Vide Mundakhede plate of Sendraka Jayasakti on 10th of Phālguna dark half of year 602 (must be śake) for indicating that in north Mahārāṣṭra there was amānta reckoning then (E. I. vol. 29 part V pp. 116-117). The Vedāṅgajyotiṣā [^1016] says that the first year of the cycle of five years began in Māgha śukla i.e. at the winter solstice. Alberuni ( Sachau II. pp. 8-9) mentions that the year began in Caitra, Bhādrapada, Kārtika, Mārgaśīrṣa in different parts of India. Kauṭilya [^1017] provided that the year for work in the Government office of Accounts was a _cāndra_ one and ended on the Full Moon of Āṣāḍha. From Vanaparva [^1018] it appears that the year began in Caitra.

It is possible to suggest that the year began with Mārgaśīrṣa because Anuśāsana (106. 17–30 ) deals with the results of practising _ekabhakta vrata_ from Mārgaśīrṣa to Kārtika. The Kr̥tyaratnākara (p. 452 ) quoting Brahmapurāṇa says that the year began with the _pratipad_ of Mārgaśīrṣa in Kṛtayuga. From Gītā X. 35 (māsanām mārgaśīrṣoham) it does not, I humbly think, follow that Mārgāśīrṣa was the first month of the year, since most of the vibhūtis with which Lord Kṛṣṇa identifies himself are the best in that particular category and as even among Pāṇḍavas Arjuna is mentioned, not as first but as the best. Only a few such as _akshara_ or Dvandva are the first of their respective categories. The Varsakriyā-kaumudi and Nirṇayasindhu p.79 say that the Brahmapurāṇa[^1019] generally accepts the pūrṇimānta reckoning and that it (N. S.) would deal with tithi-nirṇaya by generally following Brāhmapurāṇa. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa when speaking of Holikā festival on Phālguna Full Moon states that it was the end of Phālguna (Uttara-parva 132. 1). Matsya 159.3-6 say that Skanda and Viśākha are said to have been born on the 15th of dark half of caitra in a clump of reeds and it is added that the two were made into one by Indra on the 5th of the bright half of caitra and on 6th crowned as commander. It follows that Matsya thinks the month to have been pūrṇimānta.

## Jovian years

Something must be said about the 60 year cycle called Bārhaspatya (Jovian). The Viṣṇu-dharmottara [^1020] says that the first year called Prabhava of the sixty year cycle began on Māghaśukla when the sun and the moon occupied the nakṣatra Dhaniṣṭhā and were in conjunction with Jupiter. In Bṛhatsaṁhitā 8. 27-52 the _phalas_ of the 60 years from Prabhava to Kṣaya are described, as also in Agnipurāṇa chap. 139, while the Viṣṇudharmottara I. 82. 9 ff and Bhaviṣya quoted in Jyotistattva pp. 692–697 enumerate all the 60 by name with their _phalas_. Each year of the Bārhaspatya cycle has the word 'Saṁvatsara' added to it. As _yuga_ means five years, the sixty saṁvatsaras of Jupiter are twelve times five and are so described in Br. S. 8. 23-26 and in Viṣṇudharmottara I. 92. 9 and later writers suppose that the saṁvatsaras are affiliated to the lunar year alone [^1021]. In the Deccan now (and in older times also ) it appears that at the beginning of each year the Jovian name is changed. But in northern India Vijaya is the first year instead of Prabhava. The length of Jupiter's year is 361. 9267 days and is shorter than the sidereal year by 4.23 days. The result is that in 85 sidereal years there are 86 Jovian (or saṁvatsara ) years and therefore there is the suppression (kṣaya) of one year after 85 years (which is done only in Northern India).

The Jovian cycle must be an ancient one; some Purāṇas and Varāhamihira speak of it as an established institution. Vide Cunningham's 'eras' pp. 11-25 (60 year cycle) and pp. 26-30 (12 year cycle ), Warren's 'Kālasaṅkalita'( pp. 199-216), V. B. Ketkar's work on 'Indian and foreign chronology' pp. 73-82, I. A. vol. 18 pp. 193–209 (Kielhorn) and pp. 221-224 ( Fleet) and Gupta Inscriptions, Introduction pp. 169-176 ( a note on 12 year cycle and 60 year cycle of Jupiter by Sh. B. Dikshit) for origin and information about the Bārbaspatya cycle and tables, In Malabar and Travancore the Jovian cycle is of twelve years, but it is passed over here for reasons of space.

The names of the Bārhaspatya years occur rather early in Inscriptions. Among the earliest references are two, one to Siddhārtha-saṁvatsara in the 5th year of the reign of the Cālukya king Maṅgaleṣa ( I. A. 19 p. 1 ff at p. 18 ) and the other is to Saumya-saṁvatsara in the Alas plate of Rāṣṭrakūṭa king Govinda in śake 692 ( E. I. vol. VI p. 209). How the saṁvatsara names were supposed to indicate different consequences for the years concerned can be illustrated by citing two verses from the Bṛhatsaṁhitā ( 8. 28–29 ) 'when the saṁvatsara Prabhava starts there are drought, strong winds and destruction by fire and also other calamities (like excessive rain, locusts &c.); there are diseases due to phlegm, but still people are not distressed.' The consequences in the next four saṁvatsaras are auspicious, viz. the king rules over a kingdom which is full of paddy, sugarcane and barley and other crops, which is free from dangers, in which there are no hatreds, in which the people are joyous and free from the evil results of kaliyuga (such as _adharma_, poverty, accidental deaths &c.).

The subject of months is one of the most complicated. Indians followed the luni-solar calendar from very ancient times like the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Jews and the Chinese. All had therefore to resort to the device of intercalary months (adhikamāsa or malamāsa). But Indians had rarely a _kṣaya_ month also which is absent in the systems of the other peoples. This difference arose owing to the different ways of the calculations of the motions and positions of the sun and moon, in which I do not propose to enter for reasons already stated. But a few words to indicate how an additional month arises may be said here. The solar year exceeds the lunar year by a little over eleven tithis. This excess amounts to one lunar month in about 32 solar months. The Babylonians had a cycle of 19 solar years in which there were 7 intercalary months (i.e, in all 235 lunar months.) The same cycle was called Metonic cycle after Meton, an Athenian, who introduced it in Greece. This cycle is the foundation of the Jewish and Christian calendars, especially so far as Easter is concerned. From the Vedāṅga-Jyotiṣa [^1022] it appears that in a cycle of five years there were two intercalary months, one being a 2nd Āṣāḍha at the end of 2 1/2 years and the other a second Pauṣa at the end of the _yuga_ of five years. Kauṭilya's Arthasastra merely echoes this.

[^1022]: द्वयूनं द्विषष्टिभागेन ज्ञेयं सौर सपार्वणम् । यत्कृतावुपजायेते मध्येऽन्ते चाधिमासकौ ॥ याजुपवेदाङ्गज्योतिष verse 35 (ed. by Sudhakar Dwivedi, Prabhakari Press, Benares, 1906.); एवमर्धतृतीयानामब्दानामधिमासकम् । ग्रीष्मे जनयतः पूर्वे पञ्चाब्दान्ते च पश्चिमम् ॥ अर्थशास्त्र II. 20 p. 109, quoted in कालविवेक p. 113 from ज्योतिःशास्त्र.

The Pitamahasiddhānta provided that an intercalary month was to be added after thirty months. [^1023] In the Virātaparva [^1024] it is said that the period of 13 years ( 12 years in exile and one year _incognito_ ) was more than completed by the Pāṇḍavas if the cāndra reckoning were followed, as two months were to be added in five years. The purāṇas and other works give varying periods after which an intercalary month occurs. A few examples may be cited. Viṣṇudharmottara [^1025] states that the solar year has eleven days more than the lunar one and that after two years eight months, sixteen days and four ghaṭis a month has to be added. This is not to be taken literally, otherwise it would have to be held that after four ghaṭikās on 2nd tithi of the dark half of a month an intercalary month has to be added. All that the passage of the Purāṇa does is to indicate the number of days in the lunar reckoning after which an additional month is possible. Similarly, a passage of the Kāṭhakagr̥hya [^1026] says that in the lunar month in which there is no _saṅkrānti_ or there are two saṅkrāntis a month is added after thirty months have expired from a previous intercalary month. This too indicates only a possibility and not a certainty. The Nirṇayāmr̥ta [^1027] declared that a month is added between thirty and thirtysix months. This too is only approximate.

(on श्राद्ध P. 370) quotes it. समयप्रकाश p. 140 reads 'विज्ञेयो मासः स्यात्तु त्रयोदशः॥'

## Adhikamāsa and Kșayamāsa

A more definite rule is that the lunar month in which no saṅkrānti occurs is called adhika ( intercalary ) and bears the same name as that of the next lunar month which is called _śuddha_ or _nija_ or _prākr̥ta_ to distinguish it from the intercalary month or if in one solar month two amāvāsyās [^1028] and then there is an adhikamāsa or malamāsa. That lunar month in which two saṅkrāntis occur gets two names of which the first is retained and the second is suppressed (i.e. this second becomes a _kṣaya_ māsa). This means that a kṣaya māsa occurs when there are two saṅkrāntis in a month. That lunar month in which the sun enters Meṣa sign is called Caitra, that in which he enters Vr̥ṣabha is called Vaiśākha and so on. [^1029]

One or two points more about _adhika_ and _kṣaya_ months may be mentioned. The seven months from Phālguna to Āśvina can become only a _adhika_ but never _kṣaya_. Kārtika and Mārgaśīrṣa may become both Adhika and Kṣaya, but rarely; Māgha can become adhika but it has never been adhika or kṣaya (vide Ketkar's work p. 40 ). But the Suddhikaumudi says that Māgha was a kṣaya month in śake 1397; [^1030] and the Malamāsatattva quotes a text to the effect that Māgha may be an intercalary month, but Pauṣa never, About Pauṣa, Mr. V. B. Ketkar (in 'Indian and foreign chronology' p. 40) says that Pauṣa has almost no chance of becoming _adhika_, but has greater chance of becoming _kṣaya_ than Mārgaśirṣa' ( but see a little below ). A kṣaya month is generally preceded and followed, though not immediately, by an adhika month, so that there are two adhika months when a kṣaya month occurs in some years. The Siddhānta-śiromaṇi states that one out of the three months only viz. Kārtika, Mārgaśirṣa and Pauṣa can be kṣayamāsa and that when a kṣaya māsa occurs there is an adhikamāsa before and after it within three months (Grahagaṇita, Madhyamādhikāra, verse 6. explanation).

The curious reader may consult pp. 246-251 of the C. R. C. Report for light on the intercalary months. The Siddhānta-śiromaṇi [^1031] mentions some śaka years in which kṣaya-māsa occurred or would occur, viz. in śaka year 974 (expired) occurred a kṣaya month and a kṣaya month will occur in śaka 1115, śaka 1256, śaka 1378 and a kṣaya month generally occurs after 141 years and rarely in 19 years. In No. 1387 in the list of Inscriptions by D. R. Bhandarkar there is a reference to the 2nd tithi of the bright half of the first [^1032] Pauṣa ( dated saṁvat 34, probably of Harṣa era); for a reference to 2nd Āṣāḍha see Sohawal plate of Śarvanātha in year 191 (probably Gupta) in E. I. vol. 19 at p. 130: for 2nd Pauṣa Jesar plate of Śilāditya in 357 Valabhi era in E. I. vol. 22 p. 120 may be seen.

The rules about what religious acts should be done or not done in an intercalary month will be dealt with a little later. The Śāntiparva refers to the kṣaya of saṁvatsaras, months, pakṣas and divasas (tithis )[^1033]. When there is a kṣayamāsa, the adhikamāsa before it is like all ordinary māsas i. e. there is no prohibition of doing religious acts in it, but the adhikamāsa that follows a kṣayamāsa is the one that is declared unsuitable for religious rites. Adhikamāsa and kṣayamāsa may be illustrated by one example for each.

Suppose that there was Meṣa saṅkrānti on Caitra amāvāsyā, that from the first tithi following the amāvāsyā to the next amāvāsyā (which is Vaiśākha) there is no saṅkrānti and then Vr̥ṣabha saṅkrānti occurs on the 1st tithi thereafter; the month that had no saṅkrānti would be _adhika_ Vaiśākha and the month on which Vr̥ṣabha saṅkrānti takes place would be the śuddha ( proper ) Vaiśākha. Now as to _kṣaya māsa_; suppose that there is Kanyā saṅkrānti on Bhādrapada amāvāsyā, then there is adhika Āśvina followed by Śuddha Āśvina, on the first tithi of which there is Tulā saṅkrānti, then on Kārtika-śukla 1st there is Vr̥ścika saṅkrānti, then on Mārgaśīrṣa-śukla pratipad there is Dhanus saṅkrānti and in the same month on amāvāsyā there is Makara saṅkrānti. Then that month having two saṅkrāntis (Dhanus and Makara ) would be called kṣayamāsa and so there would be one month Pauṣa (constituted by two months, Margaśīrṣa and Pauṣa ). Then on Māgha amāvāsyā there is Kumbha saṅkrānti, then Phālguna would be _adhika māsa_ and there would be Mīna saṅkrānti on śuddha Phālguna-śukla pratipad. Thus in the year in which there is a kṣayamāsa, there are still 13 months and the days of the year amount to some days less then 390.

The four kinds of months, Cāndra, Saura, Sāvana and Nākṣatra [^1034] have already been described (p. 657) when speaking of the Cāndra and other years. As observed by the Kr̥tyaratnākara (p. 80 ) the nākṣatra month is not required in DharmaŚāstra, but is known only in Jyotiṣa-śāstra. Pañcāṅgas are generally prepared for each year. They contain separate [^1034a] pages for the two pakṣas (fortnights ) of each of the twelve months (or 13 months if there be an intercalary month). The five important parts of the Indian calendar are [^1035] _tithi_, week day, _nakṣatra, yoga and karaṇa_. The Muhūrtadarśana [^1036] says that it may have six parts if the signs of the zodiac are given and seven if the positions of the planets are mentioned.

[^1034]: मासास्तु सावनः सौरश्चान्द्रो नाक्षत्र इत्यपि। दर्शान्तः पूर्णिमान्तो वा चान्द्रोऽसौ विप्रवैश्ययोः । ...सौरो राज्ञः सावनस्तु यज्ञे ज्योतिषिकेऽपरः ॥ कालनिर्णयकारिका 16-17; आयुर्दायादावपरो नाक्षत्र इत्यर्थः ।

[^1034a]: The accompanying printed page is from the reformed calendar prepared according to the Karaṇakalpalatā and used by some people in Mahārāṣṭra. It may be compared with an extract of one fortnight from a Pañcāṅga 223 years earlier than the one for śake 1878. It will be found that the fundamental contents are the same in both.

[^1035]: न च <u>तिथिनक्षत्रयोगकरणानां पञ्चाङ्गान्तःपातिनां </u>निर्णयं कृत्वा तदन्तःपाती शास्त्रीयकर्मोपयोगी <u>वारः </u>कुत उपेक्षित इति शङ्कनीयम् । अहोरात्रपरिमितत्वेन वासरे सन्देहाभावात् । कालनिर्णय p. 331.

## Five items in a pañcāṅga

Vāra ( weekday ) is the period of time between one sunrise and the next and not much will have to be said about it except about the origin of week days. A great deal has already been said about tithis and nakṣatras. What remains to be said about these, if at all, and the treatment of Yoga and Karaṇa will be dealt with later on. We must revert to the topic of nakṣatras.

The names of the twelve solar months distributed two each among six seasons are very ancient. They occur in the Taittirīya-saṁhitā IV. 3. 11. 1, Vāj. S. 13. 25. They are Madhu, Mādhava, Śukra, Śuci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Iṣa, Ūrja, Sahas, Sahasya, Tapas and Tapasya [^1037]. In the Brāhmaṇas we meet with months (lunar) named from nakṣatras. It is therefore that some works speak of _r̥tus_ (seasons ) as of two kinds, viz. Saura and Cāndra. The former begin either with Mīnarāśi or Meṣarāśi, while the latter are called Caitra and the rest.[^1038] The name of the nakṣatra is often formed into a derivative and joined to the word Paurṇamāsi, Pūrṇamāsa or Amāvāsyā and sometimes the names of the months such as Phālguna and Caitra occur in the Brāhmaṇas ( vide note [^1015] above ).[^1039]

Pāṇini derives the names of the months like Caitra from Paurṇamāsi and expressly names the Āgrahāyaṇi (IV. 2. 22 ), Phālguni, Śravanā, Kārtiki and Caitri (IV. 2.23). 'Paurṇamāsi' itself is derived from Pūrṇamāsa by the Vārtika 2 on Pāṇini IV. 2. 35. The Full Moon tithi which has Puṣya nakṣatra is called Pauṣi by the sūtras (Pān. IV. 2. 3 and IV. 2. 21).

[^1037]: वायुपुराण (chap. 50, verse 202 ) enumerates these twelve months. The gr̥hyasūtras employ the saura month names; vide p. 610 above about the months for marriage. They occur in inscriptions also as the month 'Sahasya' and 'Tapasya' in the Mandasor Inscription of 493 and 529 of the Mālava era (Gupta Inscriptions p. 79 ff).

[^1038]: वसन्ताद्यृतवो द्वेधा चान्द्राः सौराश्च चान्द्रकाः। चैत्राद्या ह्यथ मीनाद्या मेषाद्या वा विवस्वतः ॥ कालनिर्णयकारिका  15.

[^1039]: नक्षत्रेण युक्तः कालः । पा. IV. 2. 3; सास्मिन्पौर्णमासीति। पा. IV. 2. 21; पूर्णमासादण् । वार्तिक 2 on पा. IV. 2. 35. The महाभाष्य explains 'पूर्णमासो वर्ततेऽस्मिन् काले पौर्णमासी तिथिः'.


Thus there were three stages; first the 27 nakṣatras were distinguished and named in the very ancient Vedic saṁhitās, then the Full Moon day was called Caitri Paurṇamāsi (and so on) because on that tithi the Moon was in Citrā nakṣatra and so on; then the months were called Caitra, Vaiśākha &c. because they had Caitri or Vaiśākhi Paurṇamāsī in it. All this occurred long before Pāṇini. Later the saura names Madhu, Mādhava &c. came to be identified with lunar months Caitra, Vaiśākha &c. and became synonyms. When this occurred it is difficult to say. But it is much older than the Christian era. It must be long before Kālidāsa, who in his Meghadūta first speaks of Āṣāḍha and then refers to the next month Śrāvaṇa as Nabhas. Often on the Full Moon day the Moon might not actually be in or very near Citrā or Śrāvaṇa nakṣatra but that did not matter; the month would still be called Caitra or Śrāvaṇa as the case may be. [^1040]

## Pūrṇimanta months

It has already been shown that in ancient Brāhmaṇa times the months ended with the Full Moon (i.e. were pūrṇimānta ). When foreigners like Kaniṣka and Huviṣka ruled over Northern India they stuck to the Pūrṇimānta Indian months in their records, though here and there they employ Macedonian month names. For example, the Greek month Gurppiya is used in Huviṣka's reign ( 28th year) in the Mathurā Brāhmi Inscription and the Greek month [^1041] Artemisios also occurs. In the Zeda Inscription the month must be held to be pūrṇimānta as the nakṣatra Uttarāphalguni is there said to have occurred on the 20th day of Āṣāḍha. [^1042] The Tekkali plates of Devendravarman record a grant on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on the 30th day of Māgha. [^1043]

[^1040]: मेषादिस्थे सवितरि यो यो दर्शः प्रवर्तते । चान्द्रमासास्तत्तदन्ताश्चैत्राद्या द्वादश स्मृताः॥ तेषु या या पौर्णमासी सा सा चैत्र्यादिका स्मृता । कादाचित्केन योगेन नक्षत्रस्येति निर्णयः ॥ q. by हरदत्त on गौतमधर्मसूत्र 16. 1, who explains ' तदेवं सिंहस्थे सवितरि या अमावास्या तदन्ते चान्द्रमसे मासि पौर्णमासी सा श्रवणा श्रावणीति चोच्यते । श्रवणयोगस्तु भवतु मा वा भूत् ।'. Mr. Tarakeśvara Bhattacharya in his paper on 'History of ancient Indian Astronomy' in J. of Gaṅganatha Jha Research Institute, vol. XI-XII (1953-55 ) at p. 17 quotes as from अमरसिंह the verse 'पुष्ययुक्ता पौर्णमासी पौषी मासे तु यत्र सा ॥ नाम्ना स पौषो माघाद्याश्चैवमेकादशापरे ॥'. It appears that क्षीरस्वामी does not accept this verse as the original verse of Amara, but only as a variant reading. Mr. Bhattacharya seems to be unaware of this. The महाभाष्य on वार्तिक 5 on पा. IV. 2. 3 says ' पुष्यसमीपगते चन्द्रमसि वक्तारो भवन्ति पुष्येणाद्य मघाभिरद्येति।'.

[^1041]: Vide E. I. vol. 21 p. 56 at p. 60 for the first and C. I. I. vol. II p. 170 for the second written as 'Arthamisiya' on the Wardak vase of the year 51.

[^1042]: E. I. vol. 19 p. 1 at p. 15 = C. I. I. vol. II, p. 145 'Sam 10 1 Ashadasa Masasa 20, Uttaraphaguṇe.'

[^1043]: I. H.Q., vol. XI p. 300 at 302.

Similarly, in the Lodhia plates of Śivagupta Bālārjuna of Kośala ( i.e. Chhattisgarh region ) published in E. I. vol. 27 p. 319 the date 'Sambatsare sapta pañcāśattame Kārtikaporṇamāsyām aṅkena saṁvat 57, Kārtika-dina 30' (p. 325 ) shows that the month was pūrṇimānta. The Rājatarangiṇi [^1044] says that king Harirāja came to the throne at the beginning of Āṣāḍha in the 4th year (of the Laukika era), who ruled only for twenty-two days and died on 8th of the bright half of Śuci (i.e Āṣāḍha) and thereby shows that the month was pūrṇimānta in Kashmir then as now.

Though inscriptions before the Christian era raraly mentioned the names of months (such as Kārtika 14th in the Kharoṣṭhi Inscription of the Greek king Menander, [^1045] 2nd century B. C.), the usual mode is to mention the r̥tu (season), then the number of the month (and not name ) in the season and then divasa, e.g. vide the seven inscriptions from [^1046] Mathurā and the Sārnath Inscription of Mahārāja Kaniṣka. [^1047] In some inscriptions only the r̥tu ( season), the number of the pakṣa and the day occur; vide Nāgārjunikonḍa [^1048] Ins. (3rd century A. D.), the Omgudu grant of Vijayaskandavarman (E. I. 15 p. 252 'Hemantapakṣe tr̥tiye trayodaśyām'), the Nāga image Ins. of Kaniṣka's time ( E. I. 17 p. 11 ) in sa. (Saṁvat) 8, gri. 4, di (divasa) 5. Vide also Lūder's list No. 922 and No. 1202 (the latter of Māḍhariputa Purisadata, samvachhare 20, Vāsāpakham 8, divasam 10). Sometimes the month is mentioned but no pakṣa and the days are counted continuously from 1 to 30 e.g. Khoh plates of Mahārāja Jayanātha (in year 177 and 22nd day of Caitra ) and Khoh plate of Śarvanātha in year 193 month Caitra day 10th without the mention of the fortnight (vide Gupta Inscriptions pp. 121 and 125), E. I. vol. 20 p. 59 at p. 63 ( saṁ. 159, apparently of the Gupta era, Māgha di. 7), E. I. 19 p. 96 (the Mathurā pedestal Ins. of Kushāṇa year 14 in Pauṣamāsa divasa 10 ), Gupta Ins. of Gupta year 129 in Jyeṣṭha-māsa di. 18 (Gupta Inscriptions p. 45 at p. 46). The non-mention of the pakṣa and the continuous counting of days from 1 to 30 continued even in the 9th century, vide Kota Inscription of Sāmanta Devadatta (I. A. 14 p. 351 ) of saṁvat 879 (923 A. D.) Māgha śu. 20. It may be noted that here the month is pūrṇimānta. In modern times people use such abbreviations as _su di or va di or vadya_. The first is abridged from _śukla dina_ (or _divasa_) or _śuddha dina_ and the latter from _bahula-dina_ or _divasa_ ( _va_ and _ba_ being often interchangeable). For 'bahula', vide E. I. vol. 16, p. 236 at p. 238 ( inscription of Rudrasena in the year 127 held to be of the śaka era ), Rudradāman's Junagadh inscription in the year 72 ( 150 A. D.) of Mārgaśirṣa, bahula-pratipad (Lūder's list No. 965 and E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 40), Udayagiri cave inscription in Gupta era 106 (425-26 A. D.) 'bahuladine' (Gupta inscriptions p. 258). For _śukla_, vide Gupta Inscriptions pp. 95, 102, 114 and for _śuddha_, vide the Nasik cave inscription in the year 42 of the reign of Usavadāta, son-in-law of Nahapāna, where we have 'Kātikaśudhe' (in E. I. VIII at p. 82 ) and Pardi plates of Dahrasena in Kalacuri year 207 (i.e. 455-56 A. D.) in C. I. I. vol. IV pp. 22, 24 ( Vaiśākha-suddha-trayodaśyām); for _su di_, vide E. I. 17 p. 110 ( of the Valabhi year 106, 525–26 A. D.). For '_ba di_' vide JBBRAS (New Series ) vol. I. p. 66 ‘Bhādrapada _ba_ 13' in Valabhi year 210 and E. I. 19 p. 126 plate of Dhruvasena (in Valabhi year 210 Bhādrapada ba di 9). It may be noted that '_sudi_' and '_vadi_' are treated as indeclinables (_avyaya_) and included in the 'svarādigaṇa' ('svarādinipātamavyayam' Pān. I. 1. 37) by later grammatical writers. The Kāśikā, however, does not include these two in the 'svarādi-gaṇa' which is an _ākr̥tigaṇa_ and therefore liable to be added to. 'Vadya' is inexplicable except as an attempt to have some word with some assonance of sound parallel to śuddha and related to '_va di_'.

##Antiquity of the word' pakṣa'

It is not clear why the word 'pakṣa' is not used in many inscriptions before and after the Christian era even though the word _pakṣa_ occurs in such ancient works as the Brāhmaṇas [^1049] and Upaniṣads. The Chāndogya-Upaniṣad (IV. 15. 5 and V. 10. 1), the Br̥hadāraṇyaka-Upaniṣad VI. 2. 15-16 employ the words 'āpūryamāṇa-pakṣa' (also pūrvapakṣa' and 'aparapakṣa' in Bṛ Up.III. 1. 5) and 'apakṣiyamāṇapakṣa ' ( and also 'aparapakṣa' for 'bahula' or 'kr̥ṣṇa'). Panini derives the word 'paksati' (meaning the first tithi of a pakṣa) from the word 'pakṣa.' (V. 2.35 'pakṣāt-tiḥ').

In South India months are known by the rāśi names (such as Mīna-masa, Meṣa-masa). That practice prevailed in the Pāṇḍya country long ago. Vide E. I. vol. 25 p. 35 where a solar eclipse is said to have occurred in the month of Mithuna in the 12th year of a Pāṇḍya king ( about 959 A. D.)

The intercalary month is called adhimāsa, malamāsa, malimluca, saṁsarpa, aṁhaspati or amhasaspati, puruṣottamamāsa. These words require some brief explanation. In the first place, it may be noted that from very ancient times the 13th month was condemned. For example, the Ait. Br. says that the gods purchased soma plant from the 13th month and that one who sells soma plant is sinful, that the 13th month does not exist as a favourable period. [^1050] In Tai. S. the 13th month is called 'saṁsarpa' and 'aṁhaspati' (1. 4. 14. 1 and VI, 5. 3. 4). 'Aṁhas' means 'sin' in the R̥gveda. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 6. It is called adhimāsa because it is an [^1051] additional (_adhika_) month. It is named malamāsa because this month is as it were the dirt or refuse of time. [^1052] The word _malimluca_ is found in the Atharvaveda VIII. 6.2 but its meaning is doubtful. It is also found in the Kāṭhakasaṁhitā. In later literature 'malimluca' means [^1053] 'a thief'.

[^1050]: तं त्रयोदशान्मासादक्रीणंस्तस्मात्त्रयोदशो मासो नानुविद्यते न वै सोमविक्रय्यनुविद्यते पापो हि सोमविक्रयी। ऐ. ब्रा.

[^1053]: मलिम्लुचो नामासि त्रयोदशो मास इन्द्रस्य शर्मासि । काठक. 38.14 (161); मलमासतत्त्व p. 768 quotes लघुहारीत 'तमतिक्रम्य तु रविर्यदा गच्छेत्कथंचन । आधो मलिम्लुचो ज्ञेयो द्वितीयः प्रकृतः स्मृतः'। and adds 'मली सन म्लोचति गच्छतीति मलिम्लुचः।'. मलिम्लुचोसि सगर इत्यासादमच्छावाकस्य । शां. श्रौ.सू VI. 12. 15, explained in the भाष्य as 'मलिम्लुचोसीत्येवमादिना मन्त्रेणासादमच्छावाकस्योपतिष्ठन्ते।'

In R̥gveda x. 136.2 ('munayo vātaraśanāḥ piśaṅgā vasate malā', sages sons of Vātaraśana, cover themselves with brown dirty clothes), the word mala appears to mean 'soiled or dirty clothes' The word 'malimluca' occurs in Vāj. S. 22. 30, Śāṅkhāyana-śrautasūtra VI. 12. 15. The Malamāsatattva derives the word as follows: "being _mali_ ( soiled) it passes on'. The words 'saṁsarpa' and 'aṁhasaspati' occur in Vāj. S. 22. 30 and 31 [^1054] respectively, and 'aṁhasaspati' in Vāj. S. 7. 31 after the mantras referring to the twelve _saura_ months, Madhu, Mādhava &c. The Tai. S. (I. 4. 14. 1 and VI. 5. 3. 4) has the formula 'saṁsarposyahaṁ-spataye tvā[^1055] 'Aṁhaspati' literally means 'the lord of sins or evil' (i.e. a condemned month ). Later medieval writers make a distinction [^1056] between 'saṁsarpa' and 'aṁhaspati'. When there are in one year two adhimāsas and a _kṣaya_ māsa, the first of the two adhimāsas is called 'saṁsarpa' and it is not condemned for all religious matters but only for marriages, such sacrifices as Agniṣṭoma, festivals ( that are not obligatory) and auspicious rites of children ( such as 'nāmakaraṇa'). The name aṁhaspati is confined to _kṣayamāsa_. The intercalary month is called Puruṣottama-māsa (Viṣṇu being called Puruṣottama) in some of the Purāṇas as in Padma VI. 64, probably with the purpose of reducing the opprobrium that attached to an intercalary month.

In the Dharmaśāstra Literature considerable space is devoted to the intercalary month e.g. in the Agnipurāṇa 175. 29-30, the Rājamārtaṇḍa (folios 68a-69, verses 1078-1115), Kālaviveka of Jimūtavāhana pp. 113--168, Hemādri on Kāla pp. 26-66, Kālanirṇaya of Mādhava, Madanapārijāta pp. 544-550, Śuddhikaumudi pp. 265-296, Malamāsatattva (Jivananda ed.) pp. 736-856, Samayaprakāśa pp. 140-155 (part of Viramitrodaya), Nirṇayasindhu pp. 9–17, Smr̥tikaustubha (saṁvatsaradīdhiti) pp. 520-529, Dharmasindhu pp. 4-7, Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi pp. 17–31. A brief treatment is all that can be attempted here.

## Acts to be avoided in intercalary month

The Agnipurāṇa provides : [^1057] one should avoid in an intercalary month the performance of the following acts, viz. of consecration of Vedic fires, the establishment of images, sacrifices, religious gifts, vratas, the recitation of the Veda after undertaking it, observance of certain _niyamas_ guch as mahānāmni, the letting loose of a bull (after sapiṇḍana), tonsure of a child, _upanayana_, rites such as the saṁskāras of nāmakaraṇa, inauguration of a king. Long lists of what may or may not be done in an intercalary month occur in many works such as in Hemādri on Kāla pp. 36-66, Nirṇayasindhu pp. 10–15, Dharmasindhu pp. 57. It would be enough if some general provisions are stated. The general [^1058] rule is that one should perform obligatory acts and acts prescribed on certain occasions even in an intercalary month. For example, one must perform even in an intercalary month daily sandhyā worship, the five daily Mahāyajñas (such as Brahmayajña, Vaiśvadeva), the offering into fire (as an _agnihotrin_) and must take a bath if there is an eclipse (in adhimāsa), although this is _naimittika_; so also one must perform the funerary rites after a relative's death even if the death takes place in an adhimāsa (this also is _naimittika_). But an obligatory rite should not be performed in adhimāsa if śāstra allows its postponement, e.g. Soma sacrifice. The general rule is that no kāmya rite (not obligatory, but to be performed for securing some object or result) is to be performed in adhimāsa. There are exceptions to this also if a certain religious rite is begun before an adhimāsa falls (such as a Prājāpatya penance for twelve days or a cāndrāyaṇa penance for a month) it may be continued even in adhimāsa. If there is drought and one desires to perform the _Kāriniṣṭa_, for bringing down rain, this may be done even in adhimāsa, since to wait might defeat the desired object.

These provisions are neatly summarised in the Kālanirṇaya-kārikās quoted below. [^1059]

Certain matters were to be done only in malamāsa such as the gift[^1060] of 33 _apūpas_ (cakes) every day to brāhmaṇas or at least once in the intercalary month; certain acts were not to be done in adhimāsa, but only in the _śuddha_ [^1060a] month, such as the sinking of wells, construction of tanks, solemn sacrifices, the mahādānas and vratas. Certain matters can be done in adhimasa as well as in śuddha-masa [^1061] e.g. rites on a pregnancy ( such as _puṁsavana_), taking interest on money lent, wages of workmen for fixed periods, monthly śrāddha (on amāvāsyā), daily gifts, bath at a holy place, _japa_ (muttering mantras), homa with barley grains or rice or sesame, rites on the birth of a child, funeral rites, _nava-śrāddhas_, śrāddha on 13th tithi with Maghā-nakṣatra, the sixteen śrāddhas, bath and śrāddha and gifts and _japa_ on lunar or solar eclipse, obligatory and _naimittika_ acts; these may be done in malamāsa also. A great deal of discussion is held on śrāddhas in malamāsa by Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 56-63), Malamāsatattva (pp. 841-856), Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 11-15), Samayaprakāśa pp. 151–155.

## Śrāddha of persons dying in adhikamāsa

This is passed over for reasons of space. For some remarks on the śrāddha of a person dying in an intercalary month, vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. pp. 546-547.

Just as the 13th month was to be discarded for religious rites, in Western countries number 13 is supposed to be unlucky, particularly in the case of company at a table.

One of the five aṅgas in the Indian pañcāṅgas is the weekday. A brief discussion on days and week-days has therefore to be held. The interval between two sunrises was considered as the most important unit of time. This is solar and is called the civil day. But _tithi_ is a lunar division of time ( as described above) and begins and ends at various spaces in the solar day. The word 'day' has two meanings, viz. (1) from sunrise to sunset and (2) from sunrise to sunrise. [^1062] In Ṛg. the word 'ahaḥ' is applied to both the dark part of it (i.e. 'rātri' night) and to the bright part. [^1063] The word _rātri_ is not so frequently used in the Ṛgveda as the word 'ahan' and the word 'dina' is very frequently used in compounds like 'sudinatva', 'sudina' 'madhyandina'; 'ahorātra' ( day and night) occurs only once in the Ṛg. X. 190.2. The word 'pūrvāhṇa' (first part of the day or forenoon) occurs in the Ṛgveda X. 34. 11. Three parts of the day also occur in the Ṛgveda viz prātaḥ, _saṅgava_ and madhyandina [^1064] (mid-day ). These are three out of the five parts of the day, the other two being _aparāhna_ and _astamaya, astagamana or sāyāhna_, which five are mentioned in the Śatapatha Br. II.3.2.9. Both 'prātaḥ' (morning ) and 'sāyam' (evening) occur in Ṛg. V. 77.2 and 'sāyam' alone in Ṛg. VIII. 2. 20, X. 146.3 and 40. The day and night were also divided into eight parts by Kauṭilya (I. 19) and by Dakṣa and Kātyāyana. The division of the day and night each into 15 muhūrtas has been already dealt with at some length on pp. 537-541.

Great divergence prevailed about the beginning of the day. The Jews placed the beginning of the civil day in the evening (vide Genesis I. 5 'The evening and the morning were the first day' and also I. 13.)

[^1062]: Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 644-45, vol. III. p. 242 and vol. IV. pp. 376-377 for the different ways of dividing the day.

[^1063]: अहश्च कृष्णमहरर्जुनं च वि वर्तेते रजसी वेद्याभिः । ऋ. VI. 9. 1.

[^1064]: उता यातं सङ्गवे प्रातरह्नो मध्यन्दिन उदिता सूर्यस्य । ऋ. V. 76. 3.

The Egyptians divided the day from sunrise to sunset into twelve parts and thus obtained hours whose length depended on the season, while the Babylonians [^1065] began the day with sunrise and divided day and night into twelve parts, each of which corresponded to two of the equinoctial hours. In Athens and in Greece generally the day commenced in historic times with the evening for the purposes of the calendar (vide Heath's 'Aristarchus of Samos', 1913, p. 281). In Rome the day began with midnight. With Indian writers the day begins with sunrise (as in Brāhmasphuṭa-siddhānta XI. 33), but they were not unaware of different beginnings of the day. The Paṅcasiddhāntikā [^1066] remarks that Āryabhaṭa declared that the day began at midnight in Laṅkā and again he said that it began with sunrise and that sunrise in Laṅkā coincides with sunset in Siddhapura, with mid-day in Yamakoṭi and with midnight in the Romaka country.

In modern times the civil day begins at midnight.

The seven day week is an artificial man-made arrangement. It corresponds to no astronomical or celestial phenomenon. The Mexicans had a week of five days [^1067] before the Spanish conquest. The seven days week prevailed among Jews, Babylonians and the Incas of South America. The Romans had a week of eight days in Republican times, while the Egyptians and ancient Athenians had a week of ten days. In the Old testament God is said to have gone on with the work of creation for six days, to have rested on the seventh and to have blessed it and sanctified it (Genesis 2. 1-3).

[^1065]: Hastings in E.R.E. vol. XII. p. 50 says so; but Prof Neugebauer in E.S.A. p. 101 says that Babylonian day began in the evening and the first day of the month was made to depend upon a natural phenomenon, namely, the visible crescent of the Moon. Fotheringham in his Explanations to Nautical Almanac 1935 (at p. 769) states that the Babylonians reckoned day from midnight and mentions Pliny as saying that Hipparchus also did the same.

[^1066]:  लङ्कार्धरात्रसमये दिनप्रवृत्तिं जगाद चार्यभटः। भूयः स एव सूर्योदयात्प्रभृत्याह लङ्कायाम् ॥ उदयो यो लङ्कायां सोस्तमयः सवितुरेव सिद्धपुरे। मध्याह्नो यमकोट्यां रोमकविषयेऽर्धरात्रः सः॥पञ्चसि. 15. 20 and 23 Laṅkā here is not Ceylon but an imaginary island to the south of India. The location of सिद्धपुर and यमकोटी is not known; रोमक seems to be Alexandria. In आर्यभटीय (गोलपाद ) the 13th verse is उदयो यो लङ्कायां सोऽस्तमयः सवितुरेव सिद्धपुरे । मध्याह्रो यमकोट्यां रोमकविषयेऽर्धरात्रः स्यात् ॥. This corresponds to पञ्चसि. 15. 23. Vide सूर्यसिद्धान्त, भूगोलाध्याय, verses 38-40 for the four cities mentioned in the आर्यभटीय being in the four directions.

## Week days

In Exodus 20. 8-11, 23. 12-14 and Deuteronomy 5. 12-15 God is said to have commanded the Jews to labour for six days, take rest on the seventh and to observe it as the Sabbath of the Lord God and to keep it sacred. The Jews gave no special names to the week days except the Sabbath which was the last day of the week and which they observed on Saturday (and not on Sunday).

The Old Testament contains no traces of proper names having been given to week days. It appears that even in the New Testament week days were indicated by numbers. Vide Matthew 28. 1 'In the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn towards _the first day of the week_ came Mary Magdalen &c. '; Mark 16. 9. _'Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week_ he appeared first to Mary Magdalen &c.'; Luke 24. 1 '_Now upon the first day of the week_ being early in the morning they came into the sepulchre'. Each of the seven days of the week is designated as the sabbath or holy day by various nationalities and religious communities i.e. Monday is the Greek Sabbath, Tuesday the Persian, Wednesday the Assyrian, Thursday the Egyptian, Friday the Moslem, Saturday the Jewish and Sunday the Christian.

On the origin and development of the seven-day cycle the leading work is F. H. Colson's 'the week' (Cambridge University Press, 1926 ). Some of his arguments may be briefly indicated. Dion Cassius (first quarter of 3rd century A.D.) in his 37th book says that Jerusalem was captured [^1067a] by Pompey in 63 B.C. owing to the reverence of the Jews for Saturday (their Sabbath day) and he further makes the statements that planetary week originated in Egypt, that it was of recent growth and that it was in general use in his day; vide Dio's ‘Roman History' vol. III pp. 129, 131 where two traditional explanations are given as to how the week days were named after planets, the 2nd of which is based on the 24 hours of the day and night. What must be emphasized is that Dio is positive that week days did not originate in Greece, but in Egypt and their introduction was recent. Dio was a Roman and wrote his History between 200 to 222 A. D. Therefore, the introduction of week days in Greece could not have been earlier than the first century of the Christian era.

[^1067a]: Vide Dio's 'Roman History' (Loeb Classical Library) vol. III pp. 126-127 where it is said that Pompey captured the Jewesh defenders of Palestine on the day of Sabbath, because they did not work on that day at all.

### Planets and week days

The names of six week days as we find them now have been found scrawled on a wall in the city of Pompeii which was engulfed in lava in 79 A. D. This points to the fact that present weekday names were known in Italy before 79 A. D. Colson finds it difficult to explain how the planetary week got ascendancy in the Roman Empire, since there is complete silence as to official enforcement of the week among Romans or even as to the recognition of the planetary week. He is perplexed by the week day names among the Teutonic nations such as Wednesday and Thursday. Sarton ( in a 'History of Science') thinks that the Jewish Sabbath, the story of creation with Egyptian hours and Chaldean astrology produced the present week (pp. 76-77). Sarton thus thinks that Greece had nothing to do with the introduction of the planetary week, but only Egypt and Babylon developed it. The modern European hours are derived from the Babylonian _nychthemeron_ for their equality and from the Egyptian Calendar for their number. Sarton remarks that the gradual spread of the seven day week throughout the world is the most remarkable instance of cultural diffusion next to the decimal notation system, since it was planned or enforced by nobody. As shown above the continuous seven day week with specific names for the days was unknown to the New Testament, which does not name the day of Christ's Crucifixion or Ascension. It is difficult to point out any certain piece of evidence which can establish that the names and arrangement of the present week days were prevalent in Greece or any other European or Near East country before the 2nd century B.C. Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos does not appear to make any astrological use of the week days. The present order of week days appears to be planetary, but if we look to the mere names the planets are arranged as Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. Ravivāra is the first day in the week for various reasons, one of which is that creation is believed to have begun on that day (vide note [^995a]). That order apparently takes no account of the distance of the planets or of their mass, light or importance. Yāj. I. 295 arranges the nine _grahas_ as the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu. The Viṣṇupurāṇa (I. 12. 92 ) has the same order. The Vāyupurāṇa says that the Sun is beyond one lakh of yojanas from the earth and the moon is beyond the sun by a thousand yojanas, the nakṣatras are 100000 yojanas beyond the Moon and each of the other planets are beyond the nakṣatras, the order being Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, each succeeding one being beyond each preceding one. If the planets be arranged in the order of distance from the earth they would stand as Saturn ( the most distant planet for ancient times), Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. The same [^1068] order is set out in the Āryabhaṭīya. Suppose we start from Saturn, then the 4th from it (but including it) would be the Sun and therefore Saturday is followed by Sunday. If we start from the Sun, then the 4th from it, would be the Moon and so Monday is the weekday after Sunday and this may be further carried on. It is argued that the order of week days was suggested by the Egyptian system of 34 parts for the day, each part being ruled by one planet in order. On Sunday, the first part is ruled by the Sun and after 21 parts the 22nd is again ruled by the Sun, 23rd by Venus, 24th by Mercury and the next day ( 25th hour) would be Monday. If this arrangement of weekdays is due to the system of 24 hours and rulers of hours, the same order can be arrived at but only in the reverse way if, instead of 24 parts, the day is divided into 60 parts (the ghaṭikās). Suppose if we begin with the Moon, each _ghaṭi_ being assigned to one planet, 57th would be the Moon's, 58th Mercury's, 59th of Venus, 60th of the Sun and so the next day after Monday would be Tuesday.

It appears that the continuous seven day week did not form part of the religious life of any nation in antiquity and even now it is no part of the religious life of many peoples. Great controversies have raged round the origin and spread of week. days. It is said by many scholars that the Indian weekdays are not indigenous, but have been borrowed from the Chaldeans or the Greeks.[^1069] An effort will first be made to present the Indian literary and inscriptional evidence to indicate how far backwards the occurrence of the weekdays in India can be carried.

[^1068]: भानामधः शनैश्चरसुरगुरुभौमार्कशुक्रबुधचन्द्राः । तेषामधश्च भूमिर्मेढीभूता स्वमध्यस्था ॥ आर्यभटीय, कालक्रियापाद 15; vide also सूर्यसिद्धान्त, chap. on भूगोल verse 79.

[^1069]: Fleet in JRAS for 1912 p. 1039 suggests that the Jewish Calendar of week days found its way into India after Europe received it i.e, in 3rd century A.D. Jayaswal (in I. A, vol. 47 p. 112 ) says that if weekdays were received from outside India, it must have been from Syria direct and not via Europe. Dikshit in his monumental work appears to hold that India received weekdays from the Chaldeans.

The oldest inscriptional evidence so far available is that of the Eran stone Pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in the Gupta year[^1070] 165 (i.e. A. D. 484), which mentions Thursday and the 12th tithi of the bright half of Āṣāḍha. Supposing for argument that weekdays were originally borrowed from some foreign country, at least a few hundred years would be necessary before such a borrowed system could become general and could be utilized even in Indian proclamations by a great Indian imperial dynasty like the Guptas.

Let us now turn to the literary evidence. The Āryabhatīya ( Daśagitikā, verse 3) mentions Thursday, [^1071] In Bṛhatsaṁhitā [^1072] occurs this 'when Pitāmaha declared that the week day Tuesday does not lead to auspicious results or when (I declare ) that the day of the son of the earth is inauspicious, what difference is there between (the śāstra ) composed by a divine author and that by a human author (like myself )?' It has been seen above ( p.458 ) that the Pañcasiddhāntikā tells us that a five year cycle started according to Pitāmaha in the second year (expired) of the Śaka era. Therefore it appears that Pitāmaha who probably wrote about 80 A. D mentioned Tuesday. The Pañcasiddhāntikā (in I. 8) mentions Monday in summarising the features of the Romaka siddhānta (vide note [^1004]). The Bṛhatsaṁhita in chapter 103 (verses 61-63) sets out what actions are proper to be done on the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and Utpala quotes eighteen _Anuṣṭubh_ verses in all from the ancient astronomer Garga on the same topic.[^1072a]

[^1070]: शते पञ्चषष्ट्यधिके वर्षाणां भूपतौ च बुधगुप्ते । आषाढमास-शुक्ल-द्वादश्यां सुरगुरोर्दिवसे ॥ Gupta Inscriptions (ed. by Fleet) No. 19 p. 89. Vide V. B. Ketkar's 'Indian and Foreign chronology' pp. 50-51 where he establishes that this day corresponds to June 21, A.D. 484.

[^1071]: काहो ढ मनुयुग श्ख गतास्ते च मनुयुग छ्नाः च । कल्पादेर्युगपादा ग च गुरुदिवसाच्च भारतात्पूर्वम् ॥ दशनीतिकापाद verse 3. The com. explains : राज्यं चरतां युधिष्ठिरादीनामन्त्यो गुरुदिवसो भारतगुरुदिवस: । द्वापरावसानगत इत्यर्थः । तस्मिन् दिवसे युधिष्ठिरादयो राज्यमुत्सृज्य महाप्रस्थानं गता इति प्रसिद्धिः । तस्माद्गुरुदिवसात् पूर्वकल्पादेरारभ्य गता मन्वादय इहोक्ताः । . This verse means 'There are 14 Manus in a day of Brahma and 72 yugas make up the period of a Manu; since the beginning of this _kalpa_ up to the Thursday of the Bhārata battle six Manus, 27 yugas, 3 yugapādas have elapsed. काहः means कस्य ब्रह्मणः अहः दिवसः ; in the system of आर्यभट ढ = 14; श्ख = 72; शू 70 and स्व 2; छ्ना 27 ( छ् being - 7 and न or ना 20 ) ; ग= 3. ब्रह्मगुप्त in ब्राह्मस्फुटसिद्धान्त XI. 11-12 criticizes आर्यभट for his views mentioned in note 1066 above.

[^1072a] . The भागवत X 7.5 says 'ज्योतिषामयनं साक्षात् यत्तज्ज्ञानमतीन्द्रियम् । प्रणीतं भवता येन पुमान् वेद पराशरः॥' This is said of गर्ग (who is said in verse 7 to have been the आचार्य of the Yadus).

## Week days

Kern assigns Garga to the 1st Century B. C. This would carry the knowledge of weekdays in India to the first century before Christ. Philostratus in his life of Apollonius of Tyana ( who died in 98 A. D.) relates (vide note 900 above ) how when Apollonius travelled in India he received from Iarchus, the chief of the brāhmaṇas, seven rings bearing names of seven planets, each one of which Apollonius was to wear on each of the week days. As Philostratus wrote in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D., this would carry the knowledge of the planetary week in India at least to the 1st century of the Christian era. The above references furnish a _terminus ad quem_ for India's knowledge of the planetary week days (viz. first century B. C. to first century A D.). The _terminius a quo_ cannot be stated with certainty.

Now some other literary evidence about the dates of which there are likely to be doubts and disputes would be set out. In the Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra (I. 4) and Baudhāyanadharmasūtra (II. 5. 23 ) _tarpaṇa_ (satiation with water ) is offered to the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and to Rāhu and Ketu and the former mentions Budhavāra (Wednesday) in II 12. It has to be conceded that other sūtras such as Aśv. gr. III, 4. 1-5, the Kauṣitaki gr. (IV. 9-10), the Hir. gr. II, 19-20, Bhāradvāja gṛ. III. 9-11 contain no _tarpaṇa_ to the week days or their deities. The Atharvaṇa-Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa has a section on weekdays (of eight verses) and points out what should be done on each of the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday (two of which are quoted below by way of sample[^1073]). The Gāthāsaptaśati of Hāla (a _prākrit_ anthology ) mentions Tuesday and Viṣṭi ( III. 61). The Yājñavalkya-smr̥ti (I. 296 ) enumerates the planets in the modern weekday order from Sunday to Saturday and adds Rāhu and Ketu as _grahas_ and provides for a sacrifice to nine grahas (I. 295-308). The Nāradapurāṇa (I. 51. 80 ) also does the same. The Matsya (chap. 93. 7 ff) provides for a more elaborate sacrifice to planets. The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (78.1-7) refers to śrāddhas performed on the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and the benefits derived from such performance (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 373-374 for details).

[^1073]: नृपाभिषेकं नृपतिप्रयाणं नृपस्य कार्ये नृपदर्शनं च । यच्चाग्निकार्यं भुवि किञ्चिदुक्तं तत्सर्वमादित्यदिने प्रशस्तम् ॥ स्थाप्यं च कर्म ऋतुभिश्व यूपो गृहप्रवेशो गजबन्धनं च । ग्रामेधिवासो नगरे पुरे वा शनैश्वरे सर्वमिदं प्रशस्तम् ॥ आथर्वणवेदाङ्गज्योतिष वारप्रकरण verses 2 and 8.

The Purāṇas contain numerous references to the weekdays. The Nāradiya provides that Monday [^1074], Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious for all rites and actions, while the other weekdays yield the desired result only in cruel or violent actions. The Matsya provides that all week days except Sunday and Tuesday are auspicious ( 253.7.). The Kūrmapurāṇa (Uttarārdha 20. 16-17) provides that śrāddhas on weekdays from Sunday to Saturday respectively yield the benefits of health, happiness ( or prosperity ), success, all desires, desired learning, wealth and long life. The Viṣṇudharmottara ( I. 142. 30-32 ) has similar provisions. The Brahmapurāṇa (118.30) recommends touching an aśvattha tree on Saturday. The Vāmana (14. 49-50 ) forbids certain actions on weekdays (such as an oil bath on Sunday or Tuesday). The Matsya specifically refers to Sunday (in chap. 55. 4, 65, 5, 70. 46 ), to Monday (in 57.4), to Tuesday (in 72. 27, 193. 8). Though the chronology of all the above works is somewhat uncertain, yet it cannot be gainsaid that at least in the first two centuries of the Christian era planets had become objects of worship and the weekdays had been named and their order as it exists today had been settled. The Mahābhārata, in spite of its vast extent and copious descriptions of Dharmaśāstra matters, is entirely silent about the names of weekdays. The cumulative effect of all the evidence adduced above is to render it extremely probable, if not certain, that the worship of the planets and knowledge of the weekdays presided over by them was known to the Indians at least between 100 B. C. to 100 A. D One further circumstance is that the names of weekdays in India are purely Sanskrit and there is hardly any reference to a weekday in Sanskrit works under any Greek or other non-Indian name, while in the case of the signs of the zodiac frequent use is made of such foreign words as _kriya_ or _leya_. Fotheringham (in explanations in Nautical Almanac for 1935 at p. 769 ) states that the mean temporal hour with the length that it had at equinoxes is first found in Hipparchus ( 140 B. C.), that Ptolemy in the Tables in the Almagest reckoned the day from mean noon of Alexandria and divided the day into sixty equal parts each of which was divided sexagesimally and that Ptolemy in his manual Tables divides the whole day into equinoctial hours reckoned from noon in Alexandria and subdivided these sexagesimally. This shows that two systems of dividing the day into 60 parts and also into 24 parts were accepted by Ptolemy himself (who wrote only about 150 A. D.). Therefore, Indians could very well have used very early the 60 divisions system for finding out the order of the weekdays instead of 24 divisions system. The Indians did not calculate their day from noon or night but from the morning.

The Āśvamedhikaparva [^1075] expressly says that the day comes first and then night.

It is possible to advance several theories about the origin of the seven day week in India. The five planets ( Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) were especially regarded by the ancient Babylonians as the powers controlling the destinies of men and therefore five leading Babylonian divinities were identified with the above five planets. In course of transmission Babylonian names of divinities assumed Roman forms i.e. Ishtar, goddess of love, became Venus, the great god Marduk became Jupiter and so on ( vide note 748 above). The five planets together with the Sun and the Moon made a group of seven heavenly bodies. In Chaldean temple worship which spread to Syria, it became the custom to sing the praises of each god on a particular day. The name of the god worshipped on a particular day was transferred to the day itself. The days which were sacred to the Sun and the Moon were called Sunday and Monday. Some Norse words like Wednesday (Woden's day) and Thursday (Thor's day ) were introduced in England. But weekdays in Europe are ultimately derived from the Babylonian gods. It has already been shown (pp. 598-600 above ) that India and Babylonia had close commercial and other contacts from very ancient times. Vide the recent work on 'Hittites' by O. R. Gurney (in Pelican Books, 1958), pp. 104-105 and 124 for technical Sanskrit words in horse breeding Vedic gods and royal names in Sanskrit in the 14th century B. C. It is possible to argue that seeing the temples of planetary gods in which worship was performed on certain days some Indians got the suggestion of a planetary week, as it has been suggested above that the ideas of the Zodiacal signs were derived from Babylonian boundary stones and similar monuments. There were Sun temples in ancient India [^1076] such as that of Mārtaṇḍa in Kashmir, that of Moḍhera in North Gujarat and that of Koṇārka in Orissa.

[^1076]: Vide Gupta Inscriptions, No. 16 at p. 68 (in 146 Gupta era) and No.18 p.79 for temples of the Sun and Br S. chap. 57, Matsya, chap. 257-263, Viṣṇudharmottara III. 60-69 and Bhaviṣya I, 131 for temples and images, Br. S. 57 (verses 46-48) describes the appearance of the Sun image and Viṣṇudharmottara III, 67-69 give directions as to how images of the Sun, the Moon and planets (Mars and others) are to be made.

Even now in some towns and villages there are temples of Saturn and Rāhu (as at Rāhuri in the Ahmednagar District of the Bombay State, which bears that name after Rāhu). Kauṭilya mentions the several divisions of time from '_truṭa_' to _yuga_ and states that two _nāḍikās_ are equal to a _muhūrta_ and an _ahorātra_ (day and night) has 30 muhūrtas ( vide note 681 above). From this it follows that Kauṭilya knew only the division of the day into 60 nāḍis and that a nāḍi was the same as ghaṭi. The Āryabhaṭiya gives the following table: 60 _vināḍis_ are equal to a _nāḍi_, 60 nāḍīs are equal to a day (Kālakriyāpāda, verse 1). Another way of citing the measures of time is: Time taken for repeating ten long letters is _prāṇa_, 6 prānas are equal to pala, 60 palas are equal to a daṇḍa, ghaṭi or nāḍi (Sūryasiddhānta I. 11, Jyotistattva p.562). Pāṇini derives the word 'nāḍindhama' [^1077] from nāḍi. Nāḍi is a very ancient word.[^1078] It occurs in the Ṛgveda and appears to mean some cylindrical instrument like a flute. [^1079] It appears that the word nāḍi came to mean a period of time when a conch or a trumpet or similar instrument was blown to announce the lapse of one nāḍi ( 60th part of the day) as there were no clocks then, Hence division into 60 nāḍis or ghaṭis (both words being mentioned by Patañjali who is generally held to have flourished about 150 B.C.) was the ancient mode of dividing the day in India and if any Sanskrit work (like the Sūryasiddhānta, chap 12.78–79) refers to 24 parts of the day, that work may be regarded as one of later times, but the whole system of time measuring by weekdays in India cannot be said to have been borrowed from a foreign source. Even Patanjali refers to the words nāḍi and ghaṭi as long in use before his time.

[^1077]:  नाडीमुष्टयोश्च । पा. III. 2. 30; on the previous sūtra there are two vārtikas and the महाभाष्य states 'अत्यल्पमिदमुच्यते । नासिका-नाडी-मुष्टि-घटी-खारीष्विति वक्तव्यम् । नासिका। नासिकन्धमः नासिकन्धयः। नाडी। नाडिन्धमः नाडिन्धयः। ... घटी। घटिन्धमः घटिन्धयः।"

[^1078]: The word 'nāḍi' and 'nāḍikā' have several meanings, viz. flute, tube or pipe, vein or artery, one half muhūrta. 'Nādindhama' means a goldsmith ( because he makes the fire flame up by blowing on it from a tube). From Kāṭhakasaṁhitā 23, 4 (Saiṣā vanaspatiṣu vāg-vadati yā nāḍyam yā tūṇave) it appears that nāḍi was a musical instrument that produced sounds (a trumpet or the like).

[^1079]: इयमस्य धम्यते नाळीरयं गीर्भिः परिष्कृतः ॥ ऋ. x. 135.7; the meaning is 'here is blown the _nāḍi_ for him (Yama) who is decked with songs of praise,'

## Division of day into nāḍis

Therefore, the division of the day into nāḍis or ghaṭis must be held to be long anterior to 200 B. C. On the whole it would not be far from the truth to say that weekdays were not borrowed by ancient India en bloc from elsewhere. It is arguable that usages in Babylon and Syria might have suggested the arrangement of days into weeks, but there is hardly any cogent evidence beyond similarity and prejudice to show that the origin of the nomenclature and the method of arriving at the order of the weekdays were not indigenous. Vide Cunningham in I. A. vol. 14 pp. 1 ff, in which he shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indian ghaṭīs results in the same order of weekdays as the European division. Sham Shastri in Annals of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. IV pp. 1-31 after mentioning some rather hazy and obscure passages from the Vedic literature arrives at the conclusion that India was not indebted to the Greeks or Babylonians for week days or for the discovery of planets. It may be mentioned that Alberuni (tr. by Sachau, vol. I, chap. XIX pp. 214-215) illustrates how week-days received names from planets, narrates (p. 215) that it was the custom with Hindus to enumerate the planets in the order of the weekdays and that the Hindus persisted in using these in their astronomical books and declined to use any other order or method even if it was more correct.
