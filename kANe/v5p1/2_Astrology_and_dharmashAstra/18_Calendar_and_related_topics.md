CHAPTER XVIII 

Calendar, eras, various reckonings about years, 

months &c. 

In order to be able to perform vratas and celebrate utsaras at the proper times and in order to find out the appropriate times for religious rites like sacrifices, upanayana and marriage people require a calendar or almanac. A calendar is a methodi cal combination or book about days, months and years for the purpose of registering in advance religious festivals and astro nomical or astrological phenomena and for purposes of civil life. In India about thirty calendars are in use by Christians, Parsis, Moslems and Hindus. Confining oneself to Hindus there is a bewildering variety of calendars in use at present. Some are based on the data of the Sūryasiddhānta and some on those of the Aryasiddhānta, while others follow comparatively later manuals like the Grahalāghava; some begin the year with Caitra sukla pratipad (or pratipadā), others with Kārtika sukla pratipad and there are small tracts like the Halar %85 prānt ( in Kathiawad) where the year begins with the 1st day of the bright half of Āsādha. Gujarat and North India except Bengal use the Vikrama era, while the Deccan and South India geno rally employ the Saka year, but Kashmir follows the Laukika reckoning. In some parts (North India and Telangana) and communities the months are pūrnimānta (i. o. end with Full Moon), while other parts ( Bengal, Mahārāstra and south India) follow the amānta (month ending with amāvāsyā) reckoning, The result is that some fasts and celebrations universally observed throughout India such as the Ekadasi and Sivaratri fasts and the celebrations of the birth of Srikrsna are observed on two different days in different parts of the country and by different sects and there is a difference of one month between the days of some observances i. e. while on the pūrpimānta reckoning a cer tain festival may be observed in Āśvina dark half, the same mouth

may be called Bhadrapada dark half ( by amanta reckoning ) and the same festival may be celebrated one month later. The con fusion is worse confounded in modern times by some calendars being what are called Drk or Dṣkpratyaya based on the data of the Nautical Almanac in order that such happenings as eclipses predicted in the pañcānga may be found to tally exactly with what is actually seen by the people. It appears that in South India there are rather too many pañcāngas ( calendars ). In Tamilnad there are two kinds of pañcāngas, one is based on drk-gamita, the other is based on the Vakya method ( that follows medieval calculations based on Aryabhata which produce less accurate results). There is the Pudukottai pañcānga ( a Vākya one ) issued under the authority of the rājas of the principality of that name. The Srirangam pañcānga (a Vākya one ) is used by the Srivaisnavas, while followers of another Vaisnava sect, the Mādhvas, have a pañcānga of their own. The Kanjanur pancānga is the most common Vākya pancānga used by the smārtas who do not use the dȚk-ganita pañcānga issued under the authority of the Saṅkarācārya. The Telugus follow the Siddhānta-candra %6 pañcānga based on the Grahalāghava of Ganośa composed in sake 1442 (1520 A. D.). In Malabar the people have a drk-pancānga, but it is based on a revision of the old Malabar system called Parahita and is not the dṛk-pañçānga followed by the Tamils. The Telugus follow the Cāndra reckon ing and begin their year called Yugādi from Caitra śukla, while the Tamils follow the Saura reckoning, start their Caitra with Meṣa Viṣu, though, their vratas and religious ceremonies being based on tithis, they have to follow the Candra-māna. Bengalis use solar months and lunar days with triennial adjustment by the insertion of an intercalary month. 

There are three siddhāntas in use, viz. the Sūryasiddhānta (used throughout India on account of its accuracy ), the Ārya siddhānta (relied on in Travancore, Malabar, and by the Mādhyas in Karnātaka and in Tamil Districts of Madras State) and the Brāhma-siddhānta ( followed in Gujerat and Rajputana). The last, however, is losing ground in favour of the first. In the Siddhāntas calculations are made from the epoch of the 

986. Warren's Kālasankalita (pp. 65-69 ) publishes a skeleton of the Siddhāntacandra pañcaāga for the 4924tb luni-solar year of the Kaliyuga current (i, e. sake 1745, A, D. 1822) for the Meridian and Latitude of Madras which is mainly based on Telugu Pancanga, but furnishes Tamil data also. 

Siddhāntas and Karanas

mahāyuga and are so elaborate that pañcāngas can hardly be made from them direct. Therefore, works called karaṇas based on the Siddhāntas are used to prepare pañcāngas, such as Makaranda in Bengal and the Grahalāghava of Ganesa; the tables of the latter called Tithicintamani are used in the Deccan, Central India and some other parts of India. There are two important points of difference between the Siddhāntas among themselves viz. the length of the year ( but the difference is only of a few vi palas ) and the second is the number of revolutions of the Moon and the planets in the Kalpa or Mahāyuga or Yuga. The Siddhāntaśiromani (L 6) specifies the matters with which a siddhanta must deal, the very first of which is the enumeration of the units of time from truti up to the end of pralaya. 

It should not be supposed that India is singular in this respect. The present European calendar is also very unsatis factory. Originally it was Julius Caesar who introduced a revised calendar in 46 B. C. with the provision that every 4th year was to be a leap year. But his calculations were not very accurate and the result was that by 1582 A.D. the spring equinox occurred on 10th March instead of on 21st March. Pope Gregory XIII declared that 4th October 1582 was to be followed by 15th October ( i. e. ten days were dropped). He further provided that century years were not to have a leap year unless they could be divided by 400 (so that yoars 1700, 1800, 1900 of the christian era have no additional day, but 2000 would have one). Even so, there is still a slight error, but only after more than 33 centuries one day would have to be dropped. The Gregorian year is longer by 26 seconds than the correct length of the year arrived at by modern astronomical calculations. Protestant England did not follow Pope Gregory's reform till 1750 A. D. when Acts were passed whereby 2nd of September 1752 was to be followed not by 3rd September but by 14th September ( dropping eleven days). Vide 'the Calendar New Style Act' 1750 (24 Geo. 2, chapter 23) and the Calendar Act 1751 ( 25 Geo. 2, chapter 30), which changed the year beginning from 25th March to 1st January and embodied the reforms made by Pope Gregory XIII. The European calendar is still very inconvenient. Under it a month may have from 28 to 31 days, the quarters of a year consist of 90 to 92 days; the two halves of the year (January to June and July to December ) contain respectively 181 (or 182) and 184 days, working days per month vary from 24 to 27 days and years and months begin on different

week-days. Easter, the Queen of feasts, could fall even after 1751 on 35 different dates from 22nd March to 25th April, as Easter is first Sunday after the Full Moon occurring on or after 21st March

Among all nations the fundamental periods of time are the same, viz. the day, the month and the year (consisting ofFundamental periods of time 

645 

seasons). The years are the constituents of eras that are vital for chronology and history. Though the fundamental periods of time are the same, there are variations in the arrangement of days to form months and yoars, about the sub-divisions of the day, about the commencement of the day, about the divisions of the year among seasons and months, about the number of days in each month and in the year and about various kinds of months. The great time measurers are the Sun and the Moon. The day is due to the revolution of the earth round its axis. The month is mainly a lunar phenomenon and the year is due to the apparent motion of the Sun (but in reality it is due to the revolution of the earth round the sun). The tropical year is the time of the passage of the Sun from one vernal equinox to the next. The latter is shorter than the sidereal year (i. e. the time between the two successive arrivals of the Sun at the same fixed star ) by about 20 minutes as the vernal equinox point shifts to the west at the rate of about 50 seconds per year. 97 A modern calendar mentions the current year ( by some era ), the month and the day of the month and generally the week-day, besides several other matters of religious and social interest. The eras and accurate knowledge of the length of the year and the month came to man rather late. The synodic month is a little over 293 days, while the tropical year is a little less than 3651 days. These are incommensurable periods. For ordinary life and calendars whole days are required; besides, the starting of the year and the month must be properly defined and must correspond to seasons and some era must be used. These are the requirements of a calendar which has to be used for civil and religious purposes. The complexity of calendars is due mainly to the incommensurability of the above two astronomical 

987. Besides the two motions of the earth (viz, its daily revolution on its own axis and its yearly revolution round the sun) there is a third motion which is not so well-known. The earth is not a sphere, its equa torial diameter being longer than its polar diameter. The result is that there is a mass of matter bulging out at the equator which is in excess of what it would be if the earth were perfectly spherical, The earth's axis has a sligbt conical wobbliog motion like that of a toy top and it describes a cycle in about 25800 years, the yearly shift being about 50"-2 seconds, due to the pull of the sun and the moon on the equatorial bulge. This causes the appearance of the fixed stars and even the pole-star changiog their positions from century to century or from period to period. Vide Sir Norman Lockyer's 'Dawn of astronomy. pp. 124-128, Van Pep Bergb in 'Universe in Space and Time' p. 82, Hickey's 'Introduciog the Universe p. 117

periods. The Moslems solved it by ignoring the length of the tropical year and holding fast by the Moon as the measurer of time. They had a purely lunar year. The result was that the Moslems' year was of 354 days and that in about 33 years all their festivals travelled through all the months of the year. On the other hand, the ancient Egyptians ignored the moon as the measurer of time and their year was of 365 days (12 months of 30 days each plus five apagomenal, i. e. additional days). Their priests stuck to this system for 3000 years, they had no leap years or intercalary months. Most ancient peoples including Indians followed a luni-solar calendar and tried to adjust the junar months to the solar year by the system of intercalary months. It has been seen above (p. 489 note 710 ) that even the Rgveda speaks of an additional month (in I. 25.8) but how it was arrived at and where in the scheme of months it was intro duced we do not know. We know that the Vedāngajyotisa 98 added two months in five years. The people of those ancient times had to solve the problem of adjusting the reckoning of the months by the moon and the years by the sun. People wanted to know in advance when the Full Moon or New Moon on which many ancient festivals were celebrated may be expected, when to expect monsoon or winter, when to prepare ground for sowing and when to sow. Sacrifices had to be in spring and other seasons, as also on New Moon and Full Moon. The lunar year of 354 days was less by about 11 days than the solar year. Therefore, the seasons would shift back if the lunar year alone were observed. Hence intercalary months were introduced by several nations. The Greeks had the 'Octaeteris' (eight years cycle ), that contained 99 months of which three were inter calary, viz. in the 3rd, 5th and 8th years. Then was introduced the Motonic cycle of 19 years in which occurred seven inter calary months (19 x 12 plus 7 = 235 ). Olmstead ( in American Journal of Semitic Languages, vol. 55 for 1938 ) says at p. 116 that the cycle of intercalation in Babylon was of eight years and that it was followed by the Greeks. Fotherigham (in Journal of Hellenistic studies, vol. 39 p. 179 ) says that intercalation in Babylon was irregular till 528 B. C. and in Greece it was un systematic in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. Vide also C. R. C. Report pp. 175-176.

Eras 

647 

The use of oras in India for calendrical purposes is not much older than about two thousand years. Continuous era reckoning first began to be employed in the records of the Indo-Scythian kings that ruled over modern Afganistan and North Western India between about 100 B. C. and 100 A. D. This is not pecu liar to India; most of the ancient civilizations such as those of Egypt, Babylon, Greece and Rome did not employ a continu ously running era till late in their careers. In the Jyotirvidā bharaṇa ( which is a later fabrication, though it professes that it was finished in galakali 3068 i. e. 33 years before the christian era ) mentions the names of six persons as the founders of eras in Kaliyuga, viz. Yudhisthira, Vikrama, Sālivāhana, Vijayābhi nandana, Nāgārjuna, Kalkin 989 and states that their eras respectively last for 3044, 135, 18000, 10000, 400000, 821 years. In ancient 990 countries no continuous era was used, but only regnal years were employed. In India also Asoka employs only regnal years in his edicts (e. g the 4th pillar edict at Lauriya nandana-garh and the 5th pillar edict at Rāmpurvā, C.I.I. vol. I pp. 147, 151, were engraved in the 26th year of his kingship ). Kautilya 991 also, when setting forth the business of the collector

This passage is variously interpreted by Fleet, Sham Sastri aod others. The difficulty is due to the word 'vgusta', which literally means 'daybreak or light' and here means 'the first day of the year which is deemed to be very auspicious.' Vide' aa atua zito * i geexistia 13 V. 1 96-97, To the author it appears that this passage means 'the royal (or regnal) year, mooth, fort night, day, the auspicious (first day of the year ), the third and seventb fortnights of the three seasons viz, rain, winter, summer bave one day less (than thirty), the other fortnights are full (i. e, months have full 30 days each ), an intercalary is a separate (period of time) - these are the times (the collector of revenue has to note). In ancient times, the year had six seasons, twelve months and 30 days in each month, The Arthasastra here says that there were six fortnights of 29 days each and so the (lunar year was of 354 days. In order to bring it in line with the solar year an intercalary month bad to be resorted to.. 

648 

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII 

of revenue specifies the times with which the collector would be concerned as 'the royal year, the month, the fortnight, the day &c.' This practice continued even under the Kusaṇas and Sātavāhanas; vide Lūder's list in E.I. X, No. 22, 32 for Kaniska, No. 1024 (Kanheri cave Inscription of Gotamiputa-sāmi-Siriyaña Sātakapi), No. 1100 and 1122 ( Karle and Nasik cave inscrip. tions of Vāsithīputa Siri-Pulumāvi). The Kalinga king Khāra vela (generally assigned to the 2nd century B. C.) uses only regnal years and no era ( vide E. I. vol. 20 p. 71 at pp. 79-80 ). 

A variety of eras have been used in India for hundreds of years; this has created a great deal of confusion in chronology and history. For the lists of eras now in use or met with in inscriptions and Sanskrit literature, vide Cunningham on Indian eras, 'Indian Ephemeris' by Swamikannu Pillai vol. I part 1 pp. 53-55, V. B. Ketkar's 'Indian and foreign chronology' pp. 171–172; P. C. Sen-Gupta in ' Ancient Indian eras'(pp. 222-238) and Dr. Saha's paper in ' Science and Culture'for 1952 (Calcutta) at p. 116 that gives a table of eras with the starting year of the eras, their current years, year beginnings (solar and luni-solar), lunar month end, provenance &c. Vide also p. 258 of the C.R.C. Repost ( Table 27 ) for a similar long list of eras. In this work only a few eras of importance will be briefly dealt with. Alberuni (Sachau vol. II, p. 5) names five eras, viz of Sri Harsha, Vikramaditya, Saka, Valabha and Gupta. He gives two different versions about the first and leaves the question undecided. 

Differing views were held even in ancient times, as to when the Kaliyuga 92 started and what event the Kaliyuga era commemorates. At present the Kaliyuga era is supposed to have started in 3102 B. C. and a past Kaliyuga year is to be arrived at by adding 3101 to the A. D. years. There are four principal views about the starting point, viz. (1) the starting point is when Yudhisthira ascended the throne; (2) it is 36 

992. Vide JRAS for 1911 pp. 479-96 and 675-698 (Dr. Fleet), H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 896-902 for discussions about the Kaliyuga beginning. In 

Ancient Indian chronology' Prof. Sen-Gupta after a lengthy and somewhat vehement argument concludes that the date of the Bharata battle is 2449 B. C. and that the year 3102 B, C. for it is wrong (p. 1-59). Vide C.R.C. Report pp. 252-254 for Kaliyuga era. It may be noted that Janamejaya, son of Pariksit, is mentioned as the performer of an Asva med ba sacrifice in Sat: Br. XIII. 5.4. Wbether he is the same as the Mahābhārata bero is more than one can say, but it is not uplikely that he is the same,

years later when Yudhisthira crowned as king Pariksit, the grandson of Arjuna; (3) according to the Puranas 993 Kaliyuga. started when Krsna passed away (vide Visnupurana IV. 24. 108 to 113);(4) According to 993 a to Varāhamihira, 2426 years prior to the starting of Saka-kāla, Yudhisthira era started i. e. 653 years after the start of Kaliyuga according to the 2nd view. The Aihole inscription appears to follow the 2nd view, since it equates 994 556 śaka year with 3735 Kaliyuga year (past). One of the earliest references to the Kaliyuga era is that by Āryabhata who states that he was twenty-three years old when 3600 years of Kaliyuga had expired (i. e. he was born in 476 A. D.).995 There is an early Cola record dated 4044 of the Kaliyuga era (i. e. 943 A. D.). Vide JRAS for 1911 pp. 689 694 for several instances of the employment of Kaliyuga era in inscriptions. Medieval Indian astronomers believed that all planets (including the sun and the moon) were together at sunrise on Sunday of Caitra sukla pratipad at the beginning of Kaliyuga and also of Kalpa.595a It is suggested by modern writers like Burgess and Dr. Saha that this epoch was arrived at by astronomical calculations carried back-ward at a late period and is a mere fiction (vide p. 253 of the C. R.C. Report). It is rather difficult to hold that this was all pure imagination on the part

In the Saṅkalpa (declaratory formula) for every religious ceremony the performer has to mention the grand divisions and sub-divisions of time beginning with Svetavārāhakalpa, such as Vaivasvata manvantara, Kaliyuga and its first quarter together with the geographical position of the place of performance in 

Bharatavarṣa, and the Zodiacal signs occupied by the Sun, Jupiter and other planets, the era, name of year (Jovian), the month, the fortnight, the tithi, naksatra, Yoga and Karaña. A verse of Devala states that if a man performing a religious rite does not mention the month, the fortnight, the tithi and the occasion (of the rite ) he will not reap the merit of the rite.9%, That is the importance of eras, years and its sub-divisions in the religious life of our people. Therefore a calendar ( pañcūnga) is absolutely necessary for every religious Hindu. 

The origin and use of the Vikrama era are as much shrouded in doubts and mystery as is the case with the saka era.997 Doubts have been expressed as to whether there was any king called

Vikramaditya about 57 B. C. the supposed starting point being 998 Nov. 58 B. C. in Gujarat where the year begins with Kārtika śukla pratipad and April58 B.C. in Northern India where the year beging with Caitra krsni pratipad. The expired Vikrama year is equal to 

A. D. year plus 57. In certain rather early inscriptions, years are referred to as Krta. For example, in Nandsa Yūpa Inscrip tion the Krta year 282 is mentioned and in three Maukhari In scriptions on yūpis (sacrificial posts ) the year 295 Krta is found.999 The Bijayagad pillar Inscription is dated in Krta 428, the Mandasor Inscription in Kṛta 461 and the Gangadhar Inscrip tion in Krta 480. 1000 Scholars are generally agreed that the Krta era is a precursor of the Vikraina era. But the name Krta applied to the years has not been satisfactorily explained. 1001 

998. K. P. Jayaswal ( I. A. vol. 47 p. 112 and I, A 46 pp. 145–153 ) holds that Vikrama was historical, ended the rule of Nahapana-Sakendra in 58 B. C, and belonged to the Sātavāhana family.

1001. Vide Bombay University Journal vol. 17 pp. 19-25 where Prof, K. B. Vyas puts forward the rather novel theory that the word Krta in the ancient Inscriptions refers to the Katha people and J. of Indian History vol, 24 (for 1945 ) pp 105-109, where Prof. D. N. Mookerjee mentions Dine Inscriptions in the Krta or Mālava-gana era and coatends that Kṛta is the era started by Kalkin who is supposed to have ushered in the Krta-yuga in the 5th century B. C. The author does not agree with both these views. Prof. Sen-Gupta in 'Ancient Indian Chronology' pp. 238 ff. holds that the Kyta eta started in 63 B, C. His grounds are that certain Mabābhārata and Paura nic passages set out in a prophetic vein the circumstances when Krta-yuga will start and he holds that those conditions were satisbed about 63 B. C. and therefore the era was called Krta In the first place the passages refer to a future date. No one thought in ancient India that the start of the Kṛta age was near. Besides, one of the passages on wbich he relies is Maha bhārata, Vanaparva 190. 90-91 ( of the Bombay edition) and 188 87 (of the critical BORI edition) and is differently read in the Sāradā Codex and several Kasmir Mss. viz. as Y SI UN TOT FETOT Frari Fiat FHOUT

Some inscriptions are also dated in the era of the Mālava-gapa (Malava tribe ), as e. g. the Mandasor 1002 Inscription of Naravarman. The Kșta and Mālava era are held to be identical and the inscriptions so far discoverved as dated in these two eras are found in eastern Rajasthan and Western Malva. It is further to be noted that, whereas we have inscriptions in 282 and 295 of the Krta year, no inscription of the Mālava era has yet been found that is dated so early. It is possible that Krta is the earlier name and when the Mālavas adopted the same era it came to be called 'Malava-ganāmnāta' or 'Mālava-gana-sthiti.' But it may be remarked that if Krta and Mālava both refer to what later became the Vikrama era, they were both being used con currently for at least one nundred years, as we have the Kṛta era 

(Continued from last page) Brahmānda III 74, 225 po doubt read it. The three Matsya-purana verses he quotes are not from the same chapter. The first verse simply says that Visou created Yavas on 3rd tithi of Vaisakha bright half and tbat he started Krtayuga on that tithi. It is impossible to draw any definite date from this verse by itself. The other two verses are Matsya 65, 2-3. They describe a vrata and fast on 3rd titbi of the bright half of Vaiśākba, which yield inexbaustible fruits to the performer, equal to all good deeds. If on that tithi when joined to Krttikā one does special worship, whatever is donat ed or offered in the fire and whatever mantras are recited become inexhaustible, These two verses contain not a word about Krtayuga and the first says nothing about Kṛttikā. It is, to say the least, a strange method to put to gether verses apart from their context and aver that a particular date has been established, 

1002. Vide I. A, vol. 42 (1913 ) p. 161-163 for Mandasor Inscription of Naravarman which is dated the 5th of the bright half of Asvoja of the Mālava year 461 ( 404 A, D.) as traditionally handed down by the Mālava tribe ( Mālavaganāmnāta). The important verse is : ffarga yozarā ancha Hista i VÉTI HIÊ Franz In the Mandasor Pillar Ioscription of Yasodharman occur the words 'मालवगणस्थितिवशात्कालज्ञानाय लिखितेषु। (year 589 of Mālava era); vide Gupta Ios. No. 35 at p. 154). On Algarrorrfura, vide Prof. Shembavnekar in J. I, H, vol. X pp. 143-155, where (on p. 145) he holds that 'ganasthiti' is equal to ganadāpaddbati'. His arguments though plausible are not correct. There should be contemporary authority (of tbe 5th or 6th century A. D.) for 'gana' meaning 'gananā'. In the Bijaygadh stope Ias. (Gupta Ins. No, 58 p. 251 ) we come across the words intaru CHFY HETTISTAETH arva: &c.'. Therefore 'Mālava-ganasthiti' should really mean 'the usage of the Mālavagana' and T rata: should meao 'as traditionally handed down among the Mālavagana'. Besides a * Mālavagana-visaya' mentioned in the Nandsa Yūpa inscription edited in E, I., vol. 27, p. 252 at p. 259 makes it almost certain that Mālavagapa means 'Mālava tribe' and nothing else,

480 and also the Mālava era year 461. The author does not think it possible that the word Krta was applied to the era because it was believed at its foundation that the Krta-yuga had started. It is possible that Krta has the same meaning as siddha (just as krtānta means siddhānta ) and it indicates that it was establi shed by agreement among certain people. The Vikrama era is specifically mentioned by name only from about 8th or 9th century A. D. 10024 Besides, the Vikrama era has hardly ever been employed in Sanskrit astronomical works and it is generally 

desiganted samrat to distinguish it from the saka era. The Yedarāve Inscription of Calukya Vikramāditya VI shows that that king superseded the saka era and started a Cālukya Vikrama era the first year of which was 1076-77 A. D. Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 1 part 2 p. 447 and 477 (and I, A. VII pp. 61-56 for reference to 400 sakakāla 1478 A. D.). 

Almost all astronomical works in Sanskrit from about 500 A. D. employ the Saka era. Why the Saka era is so called, whether it was to commemorate the coming of the famous Kusāna king Kaniska to the throne or when and where it came to be first used are among the most difficult and unsolved problems of Indian History and Chronology. In one of the earliest inscriptions expressly dated in the Saka era, viz. that of Cālukya king Mangaleśvara in 500 saka (expired, i. e, 578 A.D.) it is cited as the era of the crowning of the Saka 1003 king. Varahamihira speaks of it as Sakakāla ( in the Pañca siddhāntikā 1001 and Bșhat-samhitā 13.3) and as Sakendrakāla

or Sakabhūpakāla (in Brhat-samhita VIII. 20-21 ). Utpala ( about 966 A. D.) while commenting on Bṛhat-saṁhitā (VIII. 20 ) remarks that the Saka era started from the time when the Saka king was killed by Vikramāditya. Its years begin with Caitra for luni-solar reckoning and Mesa for solar reckoning. Its years are generally expired ones and it begins with vernal equinox of 78 A. D. The earliest inscription so far discovered in which the saka era is expressly mentioned is that of Cālukya Vallabheśvara dated in 465 saka (i. e. 543 A. D. )1005 The ins criptions of the Ksatrapa kings that bear the number of the year but no era are generally ascribed to the saka era, e.g. those of Rudradāman in 52 and 72; of Rudrasimha in 103, of Rudrasena in 122 ( Lūder's list Nos. 965, 963, 962). Emperor Kaniska (of the Kusāṇa race ) is also connected by some with the foundation of the saka era. 1006 One of the earliest date for the saka era in literature is mentioned as saka 380 in the Jain work Loka vibhāga of Simhasūri. 1007 As the Pañcasiddhantikā (XII. 2) takes the 2nd year of the saka era as the epoch of the Pitamaha siddhānta, it is not too much to assume that the original siddhanta of which a summary is given by Varāhamihira was composed according to him in the first quarter of the first

1981 in note 746 does not stand by itself and has to to be taked along with the other verses in the same work (as in Br. S.

The suge gestion made by some that sakakala simply means method of reckoning cannot be accepted in view of the words Sakendrakāla or Sakabhūpakāla. One may raise a dispute as to whether the saka era was founded by a saka king or whether it was founded by an Indian king who defeated the Sakas. But the central fact remains that saka-kāla has something to do with the Sakas and a Saka king.

century of the saka era. 1008 In later medieval and modern times (as also in the Jyotirvidābharaṇa ) the saka era goes by the name of Sālivahana. But the form Sālivāhana as that of the era occurs only in the inscriptions of the 13th or 14th century A. D. e. g. the two earliest inscriptions so far discovered men tioning the word Sālivāhana are those recorded in the plate of Devagiri Yadava king Krsna dated in Salivāhana era 1172 (1251 A. D. ) 1009 and the plate of Bukka I dated in saka 1276, current (1354 A. D.). Vide No. 455 in Kielhorn's list in E. I. VII. It is possible that the name Sātavāhana ( mentioned in Harsa-carita as the composer of the Gāthāsaptaśati) was changed into Sālavāhana, then into Sālivāhana and this conjecture is support ed by the fact that in the Gathāsaptaśati ( V. 67 ) king Sālāhana (a Prakrit form of Sātavāhana ) is mentioned; 'only two know how to raise high distressed families (by śleṣa, the family of Aparṇā ), viz. Siva beloved of the heart of Gauri or the king Sālāhana ( Sātavāhana ).' Vide C. R. C. Report pp. 241-256 for the saka era and Ludwig Bachhofer's paper on 'Greeks and Sakas in India ' in J. A. O. S. vol. 61 (1941 ) pp. 223-250, where he attacks some of the downright and very emphatic assertions of Dr. W. W. Tarn in the Greeks in Bactria and India.' 

Another era, which is current even now in Kashmir, is the Saptarsi era, also called Laukika era. According to the Rāja tarangins the Laukika year 24 was equal to saka 1070 (expired).10090 In the use of that era the centuries are generally omitted. It is a luni-solar era supposed to have begun in April 3076 B.C. on the first day of Caitra-śukla. Vide Cunningham's 'Indian eras' pp. 6–17 and Stein's Introduction to translation of the Rājatarangiṇi pp. 58 ff. The Brhatsamhitā 1010 notes a tradition that the Saptarsis (Ursa Major) occupy each naksatra for a hundred years and that they occupied the constellation of Maghā when king Yudhisthira reigned. Probably this is the

Several other eras such as the Vardhamāṇa and Buddha nirvāṇa eras, Gupta, Cedi, Harsa, Laksamaṇa-sena ( in Bengal), Kollam or Paraśurāma era (prevelent in Malabar ), most of which were once in great vogue ( at least in civil life ) but are now practically unused, are passed over here, as of only academic interest in these days. For Vardhamāna nirvana era, vide I. A. vol. 25 p. 346 where the year 2493 after the nirvana of Vardha māna is said to be equal to Vikrama year 1888 and saka year 1752 (1830 A. D.) and Buddha-nirvana era in JRAS for 1875 at p. 358 ( a Ceylonese Inscription of Sāhasa-malla's time about 1191 A. D.), where mention is made that the king was crowned 1743 years, three months and 27 days after the nirrāna of Buddha. Great controversies have raged over the Gupta era (which Fleet holds began in 319 A. D.). There are some who hold that it is really the Vikrama era (J. I. H. vol. 17 p. 293 ff and J. I. H. special number of March and April 1941 pp. 71-84 ). For Harsa era, vide E. I. 19 p. 52 and Nos. 1385–1421 in Bhandarkar's list in vol. 20 Appendix of E. I. From Alberuni (Sachau vol. II, p. 5) it appears that Harsa era started in 606 A.D. There has been some connflict of views on this; vide ]HQ vol. 27 pp. 321 ff, vol. 28 p. 280 ff (by R.C. Majumdar) and vol. 29 pp. 72-79 (Dr. D. C. Sirkar). The Kollam era is said to have started in 1176 B. C. 

It has already been shown how in Vedic works the year was denoted by several synonyms such as samvatsara, samā, varsa. In the Nārada-samhitā 1011 it is said that there are nine kinds of

Timu (to be explained later) is a day of Brabmā (Sūryasiddhanta I, 20); one human year was supposed to be a day of the gods (T ET GOE OTTET TEHT: 1. T. III. 9, 22. 1); one human month was held to be the ahoratra of pitys (2. I, 66). Alguara is

But the f. ft. further on (I. 32) says that computations about planets are to be made by human reckoning (HETTE F1541 HER FAAC). 

Nine kinds of time reckonings 

657 

reckonings of time, viz. Brāhma ( of Brahmi), Daiva ( of the gods ), Mānusa (human ), pitrya ( of the Pitrs), Saura, Sāvana, Candra, Nāksatra and Barhaspatya, but that in ordinary wordly matters only five of these are employed. The Vedānga-jyotiṣa appears to refer to four when it says that in a yuga (of five years) there are 61 sāvana months, 62 lunar months, 67 nāksatra months, Hemādri ( on Kāla, p. 9) dwells on only three of these year reckonings, viz. cāndra, saura, and sāvana, while Madhava ( in Kālanirnaya-kārikās 11-12 ) speaks of two more, viz. Nāksatra and Bārhaspatya. The Viṣnudharmottara speaks of four (not mentioning Bārhaspatya ). The three mentioned by Hemādri are those most employed in religious and civil matters, and dharmaśāstra works are specially concerned with them, while the other two are rarely referred to in the latter. A cāndra month 1012 is a time period from the end of one amāvāsyā (New Moon ) to the next amāyāsyā and twelve such months make the candra year of 354 days. It is also called a lunation. The length of a candra month varies from 29.246 to 29.817 days owing to the eccentri city of the moon's orbit and other causes and its average period is 29.53059 days. A saura month is the time taken by the sun to move through one sign of the zodiac; twelve such months con stitute the solar year, 1013 and the first day of a solar year is the

1013. The actṣvulfag (which is in two recensions, attached to Ṛgveda and Yajurveda respectively) summarizes the several items of the saura year as follows :-त्रिशत्यहां सषदषष्टिरब्दः षट् चर्तवोयने। मासा द्वादश सौराः स्युरेतत्पश्चगुणं gril hargjutrag verse 31 (Sbam Shastri, ed.). The Vedānga-jyotisa holds that 366 days constitute a year. The modern Sūrya-siddhānta says that there are 365.258756 days in a year. The other siddbłotas slightly vary from this. According to modern astronomy the year consists of 365'242196 days. Vide 'Indian Culture' vol. VIII. pp. 114-116 for a note on this ( by N. C. Labiri) and Preface p. VIII, aod p. 240 of the (C. R. C.

first day of the Saura month, Mesa. If the entry of the sun in. to the sign is in the day time then that day is the first day of the month. If the entry is in the night, the next day is the first day of the month. The time of entry of the sun into a rāśi differs from almanac to almanac and the result is that the entry may be before sunset in one almanac and after sunset in another. Therefore, there may be the difference of one day as to the first day of the month. Owing to the adoption of different ayanām sas and the difference in the length of the year, the Dṛk, Vākya and Siddhānta almanacs may differ about the first day of the year, about Pongal and other festivals. Sāyana year is of 12 months of 30 days each, the day being counted from one sunrise to the next. A nākṣatra month is the time taken by the moon to pass through the 27 naksatras; the Bārhaspatya year is the time taken by Jupiter to pass through one sign of the zodiac (i. e. about 361 days). According to modern astronomy, Jupiter takes 11.86 years (for its revolution round the sun). All these four or five divisions are not mentioned in early works and even in later days all these four divisions do not appear to have been fully utilised, though mentioned in astronomical and dharmaśāstra works. Kautilya provides that 1014 the month for workmen is of thirty days and nights, the Saura month is one half day larger i, e. (30 days in a month ), the lunar month a half day legs (i. e. 291 days ), the nākṣatra month is of 27 days, the intercalary month is of 32 days (or occurs in the 32nd month? ), the month is of 35 days (for the wages) of those who tend horses and of 40 days for those who are keepers of elephants. The month for workmen was of 30 days, but it need not have coincided with Full Moon or New Moon, while lunar months end with amāvāsyā or pūrnimā. The Brāhmasphutasiddhānta quoted by Utpala on Bṛhat-samhita II. 4 p. 40 provides that from the saura reckoning one derives the extent of Yuga, the year, Viṣuvat, Ayana, seasons, the increase and decrease in the length of the day and night; from the candra the details about tithis,

Vide Visnudharmottara I. 72.26-27 for similar verses. 

At present the year begins either in caitra or kārtika in different parts of India. But in ancient times it began in different months in different countries and for different purposes. Many Vedic 1015 passages show that the reckoning was pārṇi. mānta, that the yoar began after the Full moon of Phālguna and that Vasanta was the first season of the year. It is due to this that Madhava says in his Kala-nirnaya p. 63 (Calcutta ed.) that Sruti (Veda ) is insistent on the pūrṇimānta month (paūrṇamāsyantatve śruteḥ katākso bhūyān). The Sm. C. (on śrāddha p. 377) notes that the amānta reckoning is followed in Deccan the (Dakṣiṇā-patha ) and pārṇimānta in North India (Uttara-patha). Vide Mundakhede plate of Sendraka Jayasakti on 10th of Phālguna dark half of year 602 (must be sake) for indi cating that in north Mahārāṣtra there was amānta reckoning then (E. I. vol. 29 part V pp. 116-117). The Vedāngajyotiṣā 1016 says that the first year of the cycle of five years began in Magha śukla i. e. at the winter solstice. Alberuni ( Sachau II. pp. 8-9) 

mentions that the year began in Caitra, Bhadrapada, Kartika, Mārgaśīrsa in different parts of India. Kautilya 1017 provided that the year for work in the Government office of Accounts was a candra one and ended on the Full Moon of Āsādha. From Vanaparva 1018 it appears that the year began in Caitra. It is

History of Dharmaśāstra ( Sec. II, Ch. XVIII 

possible to suggest that the year began with Mārgaśīrsa because Anuśāsana (106. 17–30 ) deals with the results of practising ekabharla ira from Mārgaśīrsa to Kārtika. The Kr̥tya ratnākara (p. 452 ) quoting Brahmapurāna says that the year began with the pruti,al of Mārgaśīrsa in Kṛtayuga. From Gītā X. 35 (māsınām mārgaśīrsoham) it does not, I humby think, follow that Mārgāśīrsa was the first month of the year, since most of the vibhūtis with which Lord Krsna identifies himself are the best in that particular category and as even among Pānda vas Arjuna is mentioned, not as first but as the best. Only a few such as akshara or Dvandva are the first of their respective categories. The Varsakriyā-kaumudi and Nirṇayasindhu p.79 say that the Brahmapurāna1019 generally accepts the pūrnimānta recko ning and that it (N. S.) would deal with tithi-nirnaya by generally following Brāhmapurāṇa. The Bhavisyapurāna when speaking of Holikā festival on Phālguna Full Moon states that it was the end of Phālguna (Uttara-parva 132. 1). Matsya 159.3-6 say that Skanda and Viśākha are said to have been born on the 15th of dark half of caitra in a clump of reeds and it is added that the two were made into one by Indra on the 5th of the bright half of cajtra and on 6th crowned as commander. It follows that Matsya thinks the month to have been pūrnimānta. 

Something must be said about the 60 year cycle called Bārhaspatya (Jovian). The Visnu-dharmottara 1020 says that the first year called Prabhava of the sixty year cycle began on Māghaśukla when the sun and the moon occupied the nakṣatra Dhanisthā and were in conjunction with Jupiter. In Bṛhat samhitā 8. 27-52 the phalas of the 60 years from Prabhava to Ksaya are described, as also in Agnipurāpa chap. 139, while the Visnudharmottara I. 82. 9 ff and Bhavisya quoted in Jyotistattva pp. 692–697 enumerate all the 60 by name with their phalas. Each year of the Bārhaspatya cycle has the word 'Samvatsara' added to it. As yuga means five years, the sixty samvatsaras of Jupiter are twelve times five and are so described in Br. S. 8. 23-26 and in Visnudharmottara I. 92. 9 and later writers suppose that the samvatsaras are affiliated to the lunar

year alone 1021. In the Deccan now (and in older times also ) it appears that at the beginning of each year the Jovian name is changed. But in northern India Vijaya is the first year instead of Prabhava. The length of Jupiter's year is 361. 9267 days and is shorter than the sidereal year by 4.23 days. The result is that in 85 sidereal years there are 83 Jovian (or samvatsara ) years and therefore there is the suppression (kṣaya) of one year after 85 years (which is done only in Northern India). 

The Jovian cycle must be an ancient one; some Purāṇas and Varāhamihira speak of it as an established institution. Vide Cunningham's 'eras' pp. 11-25 (60 year cycle) and pp. 26-30 (12 year cycle ), Warren's 'Kālasankalita'( pp. 199-216), V. B. Ketkar's work on Indian and foreign chronology' pp. 73-82, I. A. vol. 18 pp. 193–209 (Kielhorn) and pp. 221-224 ( Fleet) and Gupta Inscriptions, Introduction pp. 169-176 ( a note on 12 year cycle and 60 year cycle of Jupiter by Sh. B. Dikshit) for origin and information about the Bārbaspatya cycle and tables, In Malabar and Travancore the Jovian cycle is of twelve years, but it is passed over here for reasons of space. 

The names of the 60 Bārhaspatya years are (with some differences such as that Br. S. 8. 35 puts Nata after Subhānu and then brings in Tarana and omits Pārthiva):

History of Dharmaśāsira (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII 

The names of the Bārhaspatya years occur rather early in Inscriptions. Among the earliest references are two, one to Siddhartha-samvatsara in the 5th year of the reign of the Cālukya king Margalesa ( I. A. 19 p. 1 ff at p. 18 ) and the other is to Saumya-samvatsara in the Alas plate of Rāstrakūta king Govinda in sake 692 ( E. I. vol. VI p. 209). How the samvatsara names were supposed to indicate different consequences for the years concerned can be illustrated by citing two verses from the Bṛhatsamhitā ( 8. 28–29 )' when the samvatsara Prabhava starts there are drought, strong winds and destruction by fire and also other calamities (like excessive rain, locusts &c.); there are diseases due to phlegm, but still people are not distressed.' The consequences in the next four samvatsaras are auspicious, viz. the king rules over a kingdom which is full of paddy, sugarcane and barley and other crops, which is free from dangers, in which there are no hatreds, in which the people are joyous and free from the evil results of kaliyuga (such as adharma, poverty, accidental deaths &c.). 

The subject of months is one of the most complicated. Indians followed the luni-solar calendar from very ancient times like the Babylonians, Chaldeans, Jews and the Chinese. All had therefore to resort to the device of intercalary months ( adhika-māsa or malamāsa). But Indians had rarely a ksaya month also which is absent in the systems of the other peoples. This difference arose owing to the different ways of the calcula tions of the motions and positions of the sun and moon, in which I do not propose to enter for reasons already stated. But a few words to indicato how an additional month arises may be said here. The solar year exceeds the lunar year by a little ayer eleven tithis. This excess amounts to one lunar month in about 32 solar months. The Babylonians had a cycle of 19 solar years in which there were 7 intercalary months (i. e, in all 235 lunar months.) The same cycle was called Metonic cycle after Meton, an Athenian, who introduced it in Greece. This cycle is the foundation of the Jewish and Christian calendars, especi ally so far as Easter is concerned. From the Vedānga-Jyotiṣa 1022 it appears that in a cycle of five years there were two intercalary

months, one being a 2nd Āsādha at the end of 21 years and the other a second Pausa at the end of the yuga of five years. Kautilya's Arthasastra merely echoes this. The Pitamaha siddhānta provided that an intercalary month was to be added after thirty months. 1023 In the Virātaparva 1024 it is said that the period of 13 years ( 12 years in exile and one year incognito ) was more than completed by the Pāṇdavas if the cāndra recko ning were followed, as two months were to be added in five years. The purānas and other works give varying periods after which an intercalary month occurs. A few examples may be cited. Visnudharmottara 1025_states that the solar year has eleven days more than the lunar one and that after two years eight months, sixteen days and four ghaṭis a month has to be added. This is not to be taken literally, otherwise it would have to be held that after four ghaṭikās on 2nd tithi of the dark half of a month an intercalary month has to be added. All that the passage of the Purāṇa does is to indicate the number of days in the lunar reckoning after which an additional month is possible. Similarly, a passage of the Kathakagrhya 1026 says that in the lunar month in which there is no sankrānti or there are two sankrāntis a month is added after thirty months have ex pired from a previous intercalary month. This too indicates only a possibility and not a certainty. The Nirṇayāmrta 1027 declared that a month is added between thirty and thirtysix months. This too is only approximate. A more definite rule is that the lunar month in which no sankranti occurs is called adhika ( intercalary ) and bears the same name as that of the

next lunar month which is called suhihu or nija or prākrta to distinguish it from the intercalary month or if in one solar month two amāvāsyās 1028 and then there is an adhikamāsa or malamāsa. That lunar month in which two sankrantis occur gets two names of which the first is retained and the second is suppressed (i. e. this second becomes a haiya māsa). This means that a kṣaya māsa occurs when there are two sankrāntis in a month. That lunar month in which the sun entors Moṣa sign is called Caitra, that in which he enters Vrsabha is called Vaisakha and so on. 1029 

One or two points more about adhika and kṣaya months may be mentioned. The seven months from Phalguna to Aśvina can become only a thika but never kstyl. Kārtika and Mārgaśīrsa may become both Adhika and Ksaya, but rarely; Māgha can become adhika but it has never been adhika or ksaya (vide Ketkar's work p. 40 ). But the Suddhikaumudi says that Māgha was a ksaya month in sako 1397; 1030 and the Malamāsatattva quotes a text to the effect that Māgha may be an intercalary month, but Pausa never, About Pausa, Mr. V. B. Ketkar (in 'Indian and foreign chronology' p. 40) says that Pausa has almost no chance of becoming adhika, but has greater chance of becoming kṣaya than Margasirsa' ( but see a little below ). A ksaya month is generally preceded and followed, though not immediately, by an adhika month, so that there are two adhika months when a ksaya month occurs in some years. The Siddhānta-śiromani states that one out of the three months only viz. Kārtika, Mārgasirṣa and Pauṣa can be kṣayamāsa and that when a kṣaya

māsa occurs there is an adhikamāsa before and after it within three months (Grahaganita, Madhyamādhikāra, verse 6. explanation). The curious reader may consult pp. 246-251 of the C. R. C. Report for light on the intercalary months. The Siddhānta-śiromani 1031 mentions some saka years in which kṣaya-māsa occurred or would occur, viz. in saka year 974 (expired) occurred a ksaya month and a kṣaya month will occur in saka 1115, saka 1256, saka 1378 and a kṣaya month generally occurs after 141 years and rarely in 19 years. In No. 1387 in the list of Inscriptions by D. R. Bhandarkar there is a reference to the 2nd tithi of the bright half of the first 1032 Pausa ( dated samvat 34, probably of Harsa era); for a reference to 2nd Āsādha see Sohawal plate of Sarvanātha in year 191 (probably Gupta) in E, I. vol. 19 at p. 130: for 2nd Pausa Jesar plate of Silāditya in 357 Valabhi era in E. I. vol. 22 p. 120 may be seen. 

The rules about what religious acts should be done or not done in an intercalary month will be dealt with a little later. The Sāntiparya refers to the kṣaya of samvatsaras, months, pakṣas and divasas (tithis )1033. When there is a ksayamāsa, the adhikamāsa before it is like all ordinary māsas i. e. there is no prohibition of doing religious acts in it, but the adhikamāsa that follows a kṣayamāsa is the one that is declared unsuitable for religious rites. Adhikamāsa and kṣayamāsa may be illustrated by one example for each. Suppose that there was Mesa sankrānti on Caitra amāvāsyā, that from the first tithi following the amāvāsyā to the next amāvāsyā (which is Vaiśākha) there

is no sankrānti and then Vrsabha sankrānti occurs on the 1st tithi thereafter; the month that had no sankrānti would be adhika Vaiśākha and the month on which Vrsabha sankrānti takes place would be the suddha ( proper ) Vaiśākha. Non as to kṣaya māsa; suppose that there is Kanyā sankrānti on Bhādra pada amāvāsyā, then there is adhika Āśvina followed by Suddha Āśvina, on the first tithi of which there is Tula sankrānti, then on Kārtika-sukla 1st there is Vrścika sankrānti, then on Mārgaśīrṣa-sukla pratipad there is Dhanus sankranti and in the same month on amāyāsyā there is Makara sankranti, Then that month having two sankrāntis (Dhanus and Makara ) would be called kṣayamāsa and so there would be one month Pausa (constituted by two months, Margaśīrsa and Pausa ). Then on Māgha amāvāsyā there is Kumbha sankrānti, then Phālguna would be adhika māsa and there would be Mina sankranti on suddha Phālguna-śukla pratipad. Thus in the year in which there is a kṣayamāsa, there are still 13 months and the days of the year amount to some days less then 390. 

The four kinds of months, Candra, Saura, Sāvana and Nākṣatra 1034 have already been described (p. 657) when speaking of the Cāndra and other years. As observed by the Kr̥tyaratnā kara (p. 80 ) the nāksatra month is not required in Dharma Śāstra, but is known only in Jyotisa-sastra. Pañcāngas are generally prepared for each year. They contain separate 1034a pages for the two pakṣas (fortnights ) of each of the twelve months (or 13 months if there be an intercalary month). The five important parts of the Indian calendar are 1035 tithi, week day, naksatra, yoga and karaṇa. The Muhurtadarśana 1036 says that 

1034. मासास्तु सावनः सौरश्चान्द्रो नाक्षत्र इत्यपि। दर्शान्तः पूर्णिमान्तो वा चान्द्रोऽसौ faasteit: 1 Hra 17: Here sunan STT: Il filmhurraient 16-17; आयुर्दायादावपरो नाक्षत्र इत्यर्थः । 

1034a. The accompanying printed page is from the reformed calendar prepared according to the Karanakalpalatā and used by some people in Mahārāstra. It may be compared witb an extract of one fortnight from a paṛcāöga 223 years earlier than the one for sake 1878. It will be found that the fundamental contents are the same in both.

it may have six parts if the signs of the zodiac are given and seven if the positions of the planets are mentioned. Vāra ( weekday ) is the period of time between one sunrise and the next and not much will have to be said about it except about the origin of week days. A great deal has already been said about tithis and naksatras. What remains to be said about these, if at all, and the treatment of Yoga and Karaṇa will be dealt with later on. We must revert to the topic of nakṣatras. 

The names of the twelve solar months distributed two each among six seasons are very ancient, They occur in the Taittirīya-samhitā IV. 3. 11. 1, Vāj. S. 13. 25. They are Madhu, Madhava, Sukra, Suci, Nabhas, Nabhasya, Isa, Urja, Sabas, Sahasya, Tapas and Tapasya 1037. In the Brāhmaṇas we meet with months (lunar) named from naksatras It is therefore that some works speak of rtus (seasons ) as of two kinds, viz. Saura and Cāndra. The former begin eithor with Minarāśi or Mesa rāśi, while the latter are called Caitra and the rest.1038 The name of the nakṣatra is often formed into a derivative and joined to the word Paurṇamāsi, Pūrṇamāsa or Amāvāsyā and sometimes the names of the months such as Phālguna and Caitra occur in the Brāhmaṇas ( vide note 1015 above ).1039 

Pāṇini derives the names of the months like Caitra from Paurṇamāsi and expressly names the Āgrahāyaṇi (IV. 2. 22 ), Phālguni, Sravanā, Kārtiki and Caitri (IV. 2.23). 'Paurnamāsi' itself is derived from Pūrṇamāsa by the Vārtika 2 on Pāṇini IV. 2. 35. The Full Moon tithi which has Pusya naksatra is called Pauṣi by the sūtras (Pān. IV. %. 3 and IV. 2. 21). Thus there were three stages; first the 27 naksatras were distinguished and named in the very ancient Vedic samhitās, then the Full Moon day was called Caitri Paurṇamāsi (and so on) because on that tithi the Moon was in Citrā nakṣatra and so on; then 

1037. ATM (chap, 50, verse 202 ) enumerates these twelve months. The grbyasūtras employ the saura montb pames; vide p. 610 above about the months for marriage. They occur in inscriptions also as the month 

Sahasya' and • Tapasya' in the Mandasor Inscription of 493 and 529 of the Mālava era (Gupta Inscriptions p. 79 ff).

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII 

the months were called Caitra, Vaiśākha &c. because they had Caitri or Vaiśākhi Paurṇamāsī in it. All this occurred long before Pāṇini. Later the saura names Madhu, Madhava &c. came to be identified with lunar months Caitra, Vaiśākha &c. and became synonyms. When this occurred it is difficult to say. But it is much older than the Christian era. It must be long before Kālidīsa, who in his Meghadūta first speaks of. Āsādha and then refers to the next month Srāvana as Nabhas. Often on the Full Moon day the Moon might not actually be in or very near Citrā or Sravana naksatra but that did not matter; the month would still be called Caitra or Srāvana as the case may be. 1040 

It has already been shown that in ancient Brāhmaṇa times the months ended with the Full Moon (i. e. were pūrnimānta ). When foreigners like Kaniska and Huviska ruled over Northern India they stuck to the Pūrṇimānta Indian months in their records, though here and there they employ Macedonian month names. For example, the Greek month Gurppiya is used in Huviska's reign ( 28th year) in the Mathura Brāhmi Inscription and the Greek month 1041 Artemisios also occurs. In the Zoda Inscription the month must be held to be pūrnimānta as the naksatra Uttarāphalguni is there said to have occurred on the 20th day of Āṣādha. 1042 The Tekkali plates of Devendravarman record a grant on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on the 30th day of Māgha. 1043 Similarly, in the Lodhia plates of Sivagupta ____1040. मेषादिस्थे सवितरि यो यो दर्शः प्रवर्तते । चान्दमासास्तत्तदन्ताश्चैत्राद्या द्वादश स्मृताः॥ तेषु या या पौर्णमासी सा सा चैव्यादिका स्मृता । कादाचित्केन योगेन नक्षत्रस्येति aufg: Il q. by ETC on STIHTĀ 16.1, who explains a HEF Faft an अमावास्या तदन्ते चान्द्रमसे मासि पौर्णमासी सा श्रवणा श्रावणीति चोच्यते। श्रवणयोगस्त WEÇ AT AT 11.

Pūrṇimanta months 

669 

Bālārjuna of Kośala ( i. e. Chhattisgarh region ) published in E. I. vol. 27 p. 319 the date 'Sambatsare sapta pañcāśattame Kārtika pornamāsyām ankena samvat 57, Kārtika dina 30' (p. 325 ) shows that the month was pārṇimānta. The Rājatarangisi 1044 says that king Harirāja came to the throne at the beginning of Āsādha in the 4th year of the Laukika era), who ruled only for twenty-two days and died on 8th of the bright half of Suci (i.e Āsādha) and thereby shows that the month was pārṇimānta in Kashmir then as now. 

Though inscriptions before the Christian era raraly mentioned the names of months (such as Kārtika 14th in the Kharosthi Inscription of the Greek king Menander, 1045 2nd century B. C.), the usual mode is to mention the stu (season), then the number of the month (and not name ) in the season and then divasa, e. g. vide the seven inscriptions from 1046 Mathurā and the Sarnath Inscription of Mahārāja Kaniska. 1047 In some inscriptions only the rtu ( season), the number of the pakṣa and the day occur; vide Nāgārjunikonda 1043 Ins. (3rd century A. D.), the Omgudu grant of Vijayaskandavarman (E. I. 15 p. 252 * Hemantapakse totiye trayodasyām'), the Nāga image Ins. of Kaniska's time ( E. I. 17 p. 11 ) in sa.

Sometimes the month is mentioned but no pakṣa and the days are counted continuously from 1 to 30 e. g. Khoh plates of Mahārāja Jayanātha (in year 177 and 22nd day of Caitra ) and Khoh plate of Sarvanātha in year 193 month Caitra day 10th without the mention of the fortnight (vide Gupta Inscriptions pp. 121 and 125), E.

The non-mention of the pakṣa and the continuous counting of days from 1 to 30 continued even in the 9th century, vide Kota Inscription of Sāmanta Devadatta (I. A. 14 p. 351 ) of sainrat 879 (923 A. D.) Māgha śu. 20. It may be noted that here the month is pūrnimānta. In modern times people use such abbreviations as su di or va di or vadya. The first is abridged from śukla dine (or divaca) or świldha lina and the latter from bihula-linı or divasa ( ra and ba being often interchangeable). For 'balıula', vide E. I. vol. 16, p. 236 at p. 238 ( inscription of Rudrasena in the year 127 held to be of the saka era ), Rudradāman's Junagadh inscription in the year 72 ( 150 A. D.) of Mārgasirsa, bahula-pratipad (Lūder's list No. 965 and E. I. vol. VIII. p. 36 at p. 40), Udayagiri cave inscription in Gupta era 106 (425-26 A. D.) 'bahuladine' (Gupta inscriptions p. 258). For śukla, vide Gupta Inscriptions pp. 95, 102, 114 and for surddha, vide the Nasik cave inscription in the year 42 of the reign of Usavadāta, son-in-law of Naha pāna, where we have ' Kātikasudhe' (in E. I. VIII at p. 82 ) and Pardi plates of Dahrasena in Kalacuri year 207 (i. e. 455-56 A. D.) in C. I. I. vol. IV pp. 22, 24 ( Vaiśākha-suddha-trayo daśyām); for su di, vide E. I. 17 p. 110 ( of the Valabhi year 106, 525–26 A. D.). For 'ba di' vide JBBRAS (New Series ) vol. I. p. 66 ‘Bhādrapada ba 13' in Valabhi year 210 and E. I. 19 p. 126 plate of Dhruvasena (in Valabhi year 210 Bhadra pada ba di 9). It may be noted that 'sudi' and 'vadi' are treated as indeclinables (aryaya) and included in the 'svarā digana' ('svarādinipātamavyayam' Pān. I. 1. 37) by later gram matical writers. The Kāśikā, however, does not include these two in the 'svarādi-gana' which is an ākrtigana and therefore liable to be added to. 'Vadya' is inexplicable except as an attempt to have some word with some assonance of sound parallel to śuddha and related to 'va di'. It is not clear why the word 'pakṣa' is not used in many inscriptions before and after the Christian era even though the word pakṣı occurs in such ancient works as the Brāhmaṇas 1019 and Upaniṣads. The Chāndogya-Upanjṣad (IV. 15. 5 and V. 10. 1), the Bșhad āraṇyaka-Upaniṣad VI. 2. 15-16 employ the words 'āpūrya māṇa-pakṣa' (also pūrvapakṣa' and 'aparapakṣa' in Bṛ Up.

III. 1. 5) and 'apaksiyamānapakṣa ' ( and also ' aparapakṣa' for 'bahula' or 'krsna'). Panini derives the word 'pakṣati' (meaning the first tithi of a pakṣa) from the word 'pakṣa.' (V. 2.35 'pakṣat-tih'). 

In South India months are known by the rāśi names (such as Mina-masa, Mesa-masa). That practice prevailed in the Pandya country long ago. Vide E. I. vol. 25 p. 35 where a solar eclipse is said to have occurred in the month of Mithuna in the 12th year of a Pandya king ( about 959 A. D.) 

The intercalary month is called adhimāsa, malamāsa, malim luca, samsarpa, amhaspati or amhasaspati, purusottamamasa. These words require some brief explanation. In the first place, it may be noted that from very ancient times the 13th month was condemned. For example, the Ait. Br. says that the gods purchased soma plant from the 13th month and that one who sells soma plant is sinful, that the 13th month does not exist as a favourable period. 105) In Tai. S. the 13th month is called 

samsarpa' and 'amhaspati' (1. 4. 14. 1 and VI, 5. 3. 4). 'Amhas' means 'sin' in the Rgveda. Vide H. of Dh, vol. IV. p. 6. It is called adhimāsa because it is an 1051 additional (adhika) month. It is named malamāsa because this month is as it were the dirt or refuse of time. 1052 The word malimluca is found in the Atharvaveda VIII, 6.2 but its meaning is doubtful. It is also found in the Kāthakasamhita. In later literature ' malimluca' means 1053 'a thief'. In Rgveda x. 136.2 ('munayo vātaraśanāḥ pisangā vasate mala', sages sons of Vātaraśana, cover themselves with brown dirty clothes ), the word mala

appears to mean soiled or dirty clothes! The word 'malimluca' occurs in Vāj. S. 22. 30, Saṅkhāyana-srautasūtra VI. 12. 15. The Malamāsatattva derives the word as follows: "being mali ( soiled) it passes on'. The words 'samsarpa' and 'amhasaspati' occur in Vāj. S. 22. 30 and 31 1054 respectively, and 'ambasa spati' in Vāj. S. 7. 31 after the mantras referring to the twelve saura months, Madhu, Mādhava &c. The Tai. S. (I. 4. 14. 1 and VI. 5. 3. 4) has the formula 'samsarposyaham-spataye tvā1055 *Amhaspati' literally means 'the lord of sins or evil' (i. e. a condemned month ). Later medieval writers inake a distinction 1056 between samsarpa' and 'amhaspati'. When there are in one year two adhimāsas and a kṣayja māsa, the first of the two adhimāsas is called 'samsarpa' and it is not condemned for all religious matters but only for marriages, such sacrifices as Agnistoma, festivals ( that are not obligatory) and auspicious rites of children ( such as 'nāmakarana'). The name amhaspati is confined to kṣayamūsı. The intercalary month is called Puruṣottama-māsa (Visṇu being called Purusottama) in some of the Purāṇas as in Padma VI. 64, probably with the purpose of reducing the opprobrium that attached to an intercalary month. 

In the Dharmaśāstra Literature considerable space is devoted to the intercalary month e. g. in the Agnipurāṇa 175. 29-30, the Rājamārtanda (folios 68a-69, verses 1078-1115), Kālaviveka of Jimātavāhana pp. 113--168, Hemādri on Kāla pp. 26-66, Kālanirnaya of Madhava, Madanapārijāta pp. 544-550, Suddhikaumudi pp. 265-296, Malamāsatattva (Jivananda ed.) pp. 736-856, Samayaprakāśa pp. 140-155 (part of Viramitrodaya), Nirṇayasindhu pp. 9–17, Smr̥tikaustublia (samvatsaradīdhiti) pp. 520-529, Dharmasindhu pp. 4-7, Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi pp. 17–31.

673 

The Agnipurāṇa provides : 1057 one should avoid in an inter calary month the performance of the following acts, viz. of consecration of Vedic fires, the establishment of images, sacrifices, religious gifts, vratas, the recitation of the Veda after under taking it, observance of certain ntyamas guch as mahānāmpi, the letting loose of a bull (after sapiṇdana), tonsure of a child, upanayana, rites such as the samskāras of nāmakarana, in auguration of a king Long lists of what may or may not be done in an intercalary month occur in many works such as in Hemadri on Kāla pp. 36-66, Nirṇayasindhu pp. 10–15, Dharma sindhu pp. 57. It would be enough if some general provisions are stated. The gereral 1058 rule is that one should perform obligatory acts and acts prescribed on certain occasions even in an intercalary month. For example, one must perform even in an intercalary month daily sandhyî worship, the five daily Mahāyajñas (such as Brahmayajña, Vaiśvadeva), the offering into fire (as an agnihotrin) and must take a bath if there is an eclipse (in adhimāsa), although this is nainettika; so also one must perform the funerary rites after a relative's death even if the death takes place in an adhimāsa (this also is nnimiltika). But an obligatory rite should not be performed in adhimāsa if śāstra allows its postponement, e. g. Soma sacrifice. The general rule is that no kāmya rite (not obligatory, but to be performed for securing some object or result) is to be performed in adhimāsa. There are exceptions to this also if a certain religious rite is begun before an adhimāsa falls (such as a Prājāpatya penance for twelve days or a cāndrāyaṇa penance for a month) it may be continued even in adhimāsa. If there is drought and one desires to perform the Kariri iṣtı, for bringing down rain, this may be done even in adhimāsa, since to vait might defeat the

Certain matters were to be done only in malamāsa such as the gift 1660 of 33 apūpas (cakes) every day to brāhmaṇas or at least once in the intercalary month; certain acts were not to be done in adhimāsa, but only in the suddha 1c5da month, such as the sinking of wells, construction of tanks, solemn sacrifices, the mahādānas and vratas. Certain matters can be done in adhimasa as well as in suddha-masa 1661 e.g. rites on a pregnancy ( such as pumsavana), taking interest on money lent, wages of workmen for fixed periods, monthly śrāddha i on amāvāsyā), daily gifts, bath at a holy place, japa (muttering mantras), homa with barley grains or rice or sesame, rites on the birth of a child, funeral rites, nire-śrāddhas, śrāddha on 13th tithi with Magha-naksatra, the sixteen śrādduas, bath and śrāddha and gifts and japa on lunar or solar eclipse, obligatory and naimittika acts; these may be done in malamāsa also. A great deal of discussion is held on śrāddhas in malamāsa by Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 56-63), Malamasatattva (pp. 841-856), Nirṇayasindhu

Just as the 13th month was to be discarded for religious rites, in Western countries number 13 is supposed to be unlucky, particularly in the case of company at a table. 

One of the five angas in the Indian pañcāngas is the week day. A brief discussion on days and week-days has therefore to be held. The interval between two sunrises was considered as the most important unit of time. This is solar and is called the civil day. But tuthi is a lunar division of time ( as described above) and begins and ends at various spaces in the solar day. The word 'day' has two meanings, viz. (1) from sunrise to sunset and (2) from sunrise to sunrise. 1062 In Rg. the word 'ahah' is applied to both the dark part of it (i. e. 'rātri' night) and to the bright part. 1063 The word rātri is not so frequently used in the Rgveda as the word 'ahan' and the word 'dina' is very frequently used in compounds like 

gudinatva', 'sudina' 'madhyandina'; 'ahoratra' ( day and night) occurs only once in the Rg. X. 190.2. The word 'pūryābpa' (first part of the day or forenoon) occurs in the Rgveda X. 34. 11. Three parts of the day also occur in the Rgveda viz prātaḥ, sangava and madhyandina 1064 (mid-day ). These are three out of the five parts of the day, the other two being aparāhna and astamaya, astagamana or sāyāhna, which five are mentioned in the Satapatha Br. II.3.2.9. Both 'prātab' (morning ) and 'sāyam' (evening) occur in Rg. V. 77.2 and * sāyam' alone in Rg. VIII. 2. 20, X. 146.3 and 40. The day and night were also divided into eight parts by Kautilya (I. 19) and by Daksa and Kātyāyana. The division of the day and night each into 15 muhūrtas has been already dealt with at some longth on pp. 537-541. 

Great divergence prevailed about the beginning of the day. The Jews placed the beginning of the civil day in the evening (vide Genesis I. 5 .The evening and the morning were the first day' and also I. 13.) The Egyptians divided the day from sunrise to 

1062. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 644-45, vol. III. p. 242 and vol. IV. pp. 376-377 for the different ways of dividing the day.

sunset into twelve parts and thus obtained hours whose length depended on the season, while the Babylonians 1065 began the day with sunrise and divided day and night into twelve parts, each of which corresponded to two of the equinoctial hours. In Athens and in Greece generally the day commenced in historic times with the evening for the purposes of the calendar/vide Heath's 'Aristarchus of Samos', 1913, p. 281). In Rome the day began with midnight. With Indian writers the day begins with sun rise (as in Brāhmasphuta-siddhānta XI. 33), but they were not unaware of different beginnings of the day. The Panca siddhāntikā 1066 remarks that Aryabhata declared that the day began at midnight in Lanka and again he said that it began with sunrise and that sunrise in Lankā coincides with sunset in Siddhapura, with mid-day in Yamakoṭi and with midnight in the Romaka country. 

In modern times the civil day begins at midnight. 

The seven day week is an artificial man-made arrangement. It corresponds to no astronomical or celestial phenomenon. The Mexicans had a week of five days 1067 before the Spanish conquest. The seven days week prevailed among Jews, Babylonians and the Incas of South America. The Romans had a week of eight days in Republican times, while the Egyptians and ancient Athenians had a week of ten days. In the Old testament God is said to have gone on with the work of creation for six days, to have rested on the seventh and to have blessed it and sanctified 

1065. Hastings in E.R.E. vol. XII. p. 50 says so; but Prof Neugebauer in E, S A, p. 101 says that Babylonian day began in the evening and the first day of the month was made to depend upon a datural phenomenon, namely, the visible crescent of the Moon Fotheringham in his Explana tions to Nautical Almanac 1935 (at p. 769) states that the Babylonians reckoned day from midnight and mentions Plioy as saying that Hipparchus also did the same.

it (Genesis 2. 1-3). In Exodus 20. 8-11, 23. 12-14 and Deutero. nomy 5. 12-15 God is said to have commanded the Jews to labour for six days, take rest on the seventh and to observe it as the Sabbath of the Lord God and to keep it sacred. The Jews gave no specil nimes to the week days except the Sabbith which was the last day of the week and which they observed on Saturd y (and not on Sunday). 

The Old Testament contains no traces of proper n mes having been given to week days. It appers that even in the New Testament week days were indicated by numbers. Vide Matthew 28. 1 'In the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn towards the first day of the we:k came mary Magdalen &c. '; Mark 16. 9. Now when Jesus wus risan liirly the first dull of the week he appeared first to Mary Magdalen &c.'; Luke 24. 1 ' Nord upon the first day of the week being early in the morning they came into the sepulchre'. Each of the seven days of the week is designated as the sabbath or holy day by various nationalities and religious communities i. e. Monday is the Greek Sabbath, Tuesday the Persian, Wednesday the Assyrian, Thursday the Egyptian, Friday the Moslem, Saturday the Jewish and Sunday the Christian. 

On the origin and development of the seven-day cycle the leading work is F. H. Colson's 'the week' (Cambridge University Press, 1926 ). Some of his arguments may be briefly indicated. Dion Cassius (first quarter of 3rd century A.D.) in bis 37th book says that Jerusalem was captured 1067a by Pompey in 63 B. C. owing to the reverence of the Jews for Saturday (their Sabbath day) and he further makes the statements that planetary week originated in Egypt, that it wūs of rocent growth and that it was in general use in his Jay; vide Dio's ‘Roman History' vol. III pp. 129, 131 where iwo traditional explanations are given as to how the week days were named after planets, the 2nd of which is based on the 24 hours of the day and night. What must be emphasized is that Dio is positive that week days did not originate in Greece, but in Egypt and their introduction was recent. Dio was a Roman and wrote his History between 200 to 222 A. D. Therefore, the introduction of week days in Greece could not have been earlier than the first century of the 

1067 a. Vide Dio's 'Roman History' (Loeb 'Classical Library) vol. III pp. 126-127 where it is said that Pompey captured the Jewesb defenders of Palesiine on the day of Sabbath, because they did not work on that day at all,

Christian era. The names of six week days as we find them now have been found scrawled on a wall in the city of Pompeii which was engulfed in lava in 79 A. D. This points to the fact that present weekday names were known in Italy before 79 A. D. Colson finds it difficult to explain how the planetary week got ascendancy in the Roman Empire, since there is complete silence as to official enforcement of the week among Romans or even as to the recognition of the planetary week. He is perplexed by the week day names among the Teutonic nations such as Wednesday and Thursday. Sarton ( in a 'History of Science') thinks that the Jewish Sabbath, the story of creation with Egyptian hours and Chaldean astrology produced the present week (pp. 76-77). Sarton thus thinks that Greece had nothing to do with the introduction of the planetary week, but only Egypt and Babylon developed it. The modern European hours are derived from the Babylonian nychthemeron for their equality and from the Egyptian Calendar for their number. Sarton remarks that the gradual spread of the seven day week throughout the world is the most remarkable instance of cultural diffusion next to the decimal notation system, since it was planned or enforced by nobody. As shown above the continuous seven day week with specific names for the days was unknown to the New Testament, which does not name the day of Christ's Crucifixion or Ascension. It is difficult to point out any certain piece of evidence which can establish that the names and arrangement of the present week days were prevalent in Greece or any other European or Near East country before the 2nd century B. C. Ptolemy in his Tetrabiblos does not appear to make any astrological use of the week days. The present order of week days appears to be planetary, but if we look to the mere Dames the planets are arranged as Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn. Ravivāra is the first day in the week for various reasons, one of which is that creation is believed to have begun on that day (vide note 995a). That order apparently takes no account of the distance of the planets or of their mass, light or importance. Yāj. I. 295 arranges the nine grahas as the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu. The Visnupurāṇa (I. 12. 92 ) has the same order. The Vāyupurāpa says that the Sun is beyond one lakh of yojanas from the earth and the moon is beyond the sun by a thousand yojanas, the naksatras are 100000 yojanas beyond the Moon and each of the other planets are beyond the naksatras, the order being Mercury, Venus, Mars,

Jupiter and Saturn, each succeeding one being beyond each preceding one. If the planets be arranged in the order of distance from the earth they would stand as Saturn ( the most distant planet for ancient times), Jupiter, Mars, Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon. The same 1068 order is set out in the Arya bhatīya. Suppose we start from Saturn, then the 4th from it (but including it) would be the Sun and therefore Saturday is followed by Sunday. If we start from the Sun, then the 4th from it, would be the Moon and so Monday is the weekday after Sunday and this may be further carried on. It is argued that the order of week days was suggested by the Egyptian system of 34 parts for the day, each part being ruled by one planet in order. On Sunday, the first part is ruled by the Sun and after 21 parts the 22nd is again ruled by the Sun, 23rd by Venus, 24th by Mercury and the next day ( 25th hour) would be Monday. If this arrange. ment of weekdays is due to the system of 24 hours and rulers of hours, the same order can be arrived at but only in the reverse way if, instead of 24 parts, the day is divided into 60 parts (the ghaṭikās). Suppose if we begin with the Moon, each ghaṭi being assigned to one planet, 57th would be the Moon's, 58th Mercury's, 59th of Venus, 60th of the Sun and so the next day after Monday would be Tuesday. 

It appears that the continuous seven day week did not form part of the religious life of any nation in antiquity and even now it is no part of the religious life of many peoples. Great controversies have raged round the origin and spread of week. days. It is said by many scholars that the Indian weekdays are not indigenous, but have been borrowed from the Chaldeans or the Greeks.1069 An effort will first be made to present the Indian literary and inscriptional evidence to indicate how far backwards the occurrence of the weekdays in India can be carried. The oldest inscriptional evidence so far available is that of the Eran stone Pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in the

1069. Fleet in JRAS for 1912 p. 1039 suggests that the Jewish Calendar of week days found its way into lodia after Europe received it i, e, in 3rd century A.D. Jayaswal (in I. A, vol. 47 p. 112 ) says that if week. days were received from outside India, it must have beea from Syria direct and not via Europe. Dikshit in his monumental work appears to hold that India received weekdays from the Cbaldeans.

Gupta year?'70 165 (i. 0. A. D. 481), which meations Thursday and the 12th tithi of the bright half of Āsādha. Supposing for argument that weekdays were originally borrowed from some foreign country, at least a few hundred years would be necessary before such a borrowed system could become general and could be utilized even in Indian proclamations by a great Indian imperial dynasty like the Guptas. 

Let us now turn to the literary evidence. The Aryabhatīya ( Dasagitikā, verse 3) mentions Thursday, 1071 In Brhat samhitā 107. occurs this 'when Pitāmaha declared that the week day Tuesday does not lead to auspicious results or when (I declare ) that the day of the son of the earth is inauspicious, what difference is there between (the śāstra ) composed by a divine author and that by a human author (like myself )?' It has been seen above ( p.458 ) that the Pañsasiddhāntikā tells us that a five year cycle started according to Pitamaha in the second year (expired) of the Saka era. Therefore it appears that Pitāmaha who probably wrote about 80 A. D mentioned Tuesday. The Pañcasiddhāntikā (in I. 8) mentions Monday in summarising the features of the Romaka siddhānta (vide note 1004). The Brhatsamhita in chapter 103 (verses 61-63) sets out what actions are proper to be done on the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and Utpala quotes eighteon Anustubh verses in all from the ancient astronomer Garga on the same topic.1072a Kern

assigns Garga to the 1st Century B. C. This would carry the knowledge of weekdays in India to the first century before Christ. Philostratus in his life of Apollonius of Tyana ( who died in 98 A. D.) relates (vide note 900 above ) how when Apollonius travelled in India he received from Iarchus, the chief of the brāhmaṇas, seven rings bearing names of seven planets, each one of which Apollonius was to wear on each of the week days. As Philostratus wrote in the first quarter of the 3rd century A. D., this would carry the knowledge of the planetary week in India at least to the 1st century of the Christian era. The above references furnish a terminus ad quem for India's knowledge of the planetary week days (viz. first century B. C. to first century A D.). The terminius a quo cannot be stated with certainty. 

Now some other literary evidence about the dates of which there are likely to be doubts and disputes would be set out. In the Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra (I. 4) and Baudhāyanadharma sūtra (II. 5. 23 ) tarpann (satiation with water ) is offered to the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn and to Rāhu and Ketu and the former mentions Budhavāra (Wednes. day ) in II 12. It has to be conceded that other sūtras such as Aśv. gr. III, 4. 1-5, the Kausitaki gr. (IV. 9-10), the Hir. gr. II, 19-20, Bhāradvāja gr. III. 9-11 contain no tarpniṇa to the week days or their deities. The Atharvaṇa-Vedānga Jyotisa has a section on weekdays (of eight yerses) and points out what should be done on each of the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday (two of which are quoted below by way of sample1073). The Gāthāsaptaśati of Hāla (a prākrit anthology ) mentions Tuesday and Visti ( III. 61). The Yājñavalkya-smr̥ti (I. 296 ) enumerates the planets in the modern weekday order from Sunday to Saturday and adds Rāhu and Ketu as gralis and provides for a sacrifice to nine grahas (I. 295-308). The Nāradapurāna (I. 51. 80 ) also does the same. The Matsya (chap. 93. 7 ff) provides for a more elaborate sacrifice to planets. The Viṣnudharmasūtra (78.1-7) refers to śrāddhas performed on the seven weekdays from Sunday to Saturday and the benefits derived from such performance (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 373-374 for details). The Purāṇas contain numerous references to the

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. II, Ch. XVIII weekdays. The Nāradiya provides that Monday 1074, Wednes day, Thursday and Friday are auspicious for all rites and actions, while the other weekdays yield the desired result only in cruel or violent actions. The Matsya provides that all week days except Sunday and Tuesday are auspicious ( 253.7.). The Kūrmapurāna (Uttarārdha 20. 16-17) provides that śrāddhas on weekdays from Sunday to Saturday respectively yield the benefits of health, happiness ( or prosperity ), success, all desires, desired learning, wealth and long life. The Visṇudharmottara ( I. 142. 30-32 ) has similar provisions. The Brahmapurāpa (118.30) recommends touching an aśvattha tree on Saturday. The Vāmana (14. 49-50 ) forbids certain actions on weekdays (such as an oil bath on Sunday or Tuesday). The Matsya specifically refers to Sunday (in chap. 55. 4, 65, 5, 70. 46 ), to Monday (in 57.4), to Tuesday (in 72. 27, 193. 8). Though the chronology of all the above works is somewhat uncertain, yet it cannot be gainsaid that at least in the first two centuries of the Christian era planets had become objects of worship and the weekdays had been named and their order as it exists today had been settled. The Mahābhārata, in spite of its vast extent and copious des criptions of Dharmaśāstra matters, is entirely silent about the names of weekdays. The cumulative effect of all the evidence adduced above is to render it extremely probable, if not certain, that the worship of the planets and knowledge of the weekdays presided over by them was known to the Indians at least bet ween 100 B. C. to 100 A. D One further circumstance is that the names of weekdays in India are purely Sanskrit and there is hardly any reference to a weekday in Sanskrit works under any Greek or other non-Indian name, while in the case of the signs of the zodiac frequent use is made of such foreign words as kriya or leya. Fotheringham (in explanations in Nautical Almanac for 1935 at p. 769 ) states that the mean temporal hour with the 

·length that it had at equinoxes is first found in Hipparchus ( 140 B. C.), that Ptolemy in the Tables in the Almagest reckon ed the day from mean noon of Alexandria and divided the day into sixty equal parts each of which was divided sexagesimally and that Ptolemy in his manual Tables divides the whole day into equinoctial hours reckoned from noon in Alexandria and subdivided these sexagesimally. This shows that two systems

of dividing the day into 60 parts and also into 24 parts were accepted by Ptolemy himself (who wrote only about 150 A. D.). Therefore, Indians could very well have used very early the 60 divisions system for finding out the order of the weekdays instead of 24 divisions system. The Indians did not calculate their day from noon or night but from the morning. The Āśvamedhika parva 1075 expressly says that the day comes first and then night. 

It is possible to advance several theories about the origin of the seven day week in India. The five planets ( Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) were especially regarded by the ancient Babylonians as the powers controlling the destinies of men and therefore five leading Babylonian divinities were identified with the above five planets. In course of transmission Babylonian names of divinities assumed Roman forms i. e. Ishtar, goddess of love, became Venus, the great god Marduk became Jupiter and so on ( vide note 748 above). The five planets together with the Sun and the Moon made a group of seven heavenly bodies. In Chaldean temple worship which spread to Syria, it became the custom to sing the praises of each god on a particular day. The name of the god worshipped on a particular day was transferred to the day itself. The days which were sacred to the Sun and the Moon were called Sunday and Monday. Some Norse words like Wednesday (Woden's day) and Thursday (Thor's day ) were introduced in England. But weekdays in Europe are ulti mately derived from the Babylonian gods. It has already been shown (pp. 598-600 above ) that India and Babylonia had close commercial and other contacts from very ancient times. Vide the recent work on "Hittites' by O. R. Gurney (in Pelican Books, 1958), pp. 104-105 and 124 for technical Sanskrit words in horse breeding Vedic gods and royal names in Sanskrit in the 14th century B. C. It is possible to argue that seeing the temples of planetary gods in which worship was performed on certain days some Indians got the suggestion of a planetary week, as it has been suggested above that the ideas of the Zodiacal signs were derived from Babylonian boundary stones and similar monuments. There were Sun temples in ancient India 1076

such as that of Mārtanda in Kashmir, that of Modhera in North Gujerat and that of Koṇārka in Orissa. Even now in some towns and villages there are temples of Saturn and Rābu (as at Rāhuri in the Ahmednagar District of the Bombay State, which bears that name after Rāhu). Kautilya mentions the several divisions of time from 'truta' to yuga and states that two nūdikūs are equal to a muhurta and an ahorūtra (day and night) has 30 muhūrtas ( vide note 681 above). From: this it follows that Kautilya knew only the division of the day into 60 nādis and that a nādi was the same as ghaṭi. The Aryabhatiya gives the following table: 60 linādīs are equal to a nādi, 60 nādīs are equal to a day (Kālakriyāpāda, verse 1). Another way of citing the measures of time is: Time taken for repeating ten long letters is prāṇa, 6 prānas are equal to pala, 60 palas ara equal to a danda, ghaṭi or nādi (Sūryasiddhānta I. 11, Jyotist-attva p.562). Pāṇini derives the word 'nādindhama' 1077 from nādi. Nādi is a very ancient word.1078 It occurs in the Rgveda and appears to mean some cylindrical instrument like a flute. 1079 It appears that the word nādi came to mean a period of time when a conch or a trumpet or similar instrument was blown to announce the lapse of one nādi ( 60th part of the day) as there were no clocks then, Hence division into 60 nādis or gbatis (both words being mon tioned by Patañjali who is generally held to have flourished about 150 B. C.) was the ancient mode of dividing the day in India and if any Sanskrit work (like the Sūryasiddhānta, chap 12.78–79) refers to 24 parts of the day, that work may be regarded as one of later times, but the whole system of time measuring by weekdays in India cannot be said to have been borrowed from a foreign source. Even Patanjali refers to the words nādi and ghaṭi as long in use before his time. Therefore, the division of the day

1078. The word 'nādi' and 'nādikā' have several meanings, viz. flute, tube or pipe, vein or artery, one half muhūrta. Nādindbama' means a goldsmith ( because he makes the fire fame up by blowing on it from & tube). From Kathakasambit 23, 4 (Saisā vanaspatisu vāg-vadati ya nadyan yā tūṇave) it appears that nādi was a musical instrument that produced sounds (a trumpet or the like).

into nādīs or ghaṭis must be held to be long anterior to 200 B. C. On the whole it would not be far from the truth to say that weekdays were not borrowed by ancient India en bloc from elsewhere. It is arguable that usages in Babylon and Syria might have suggested the arrangement of days into weeks, but there is hardly any cogent evidence beyond similarity and prejudice to show that the origin of the nomenclature and the method of arriving at the order of the weekdays were not indi genous. Vide Cunningham in I, A. vol. 14 pp. 1 ff, in which he shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indian ghatīs results in the same order of weekdays as the European division. Sham Shastri in Annals of Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, vol. IV pp. 1-31 after mentioning some rather hazy and obscure passages from the Vedic literature arrives at the conclusion that India was not indebted to the Greeks or Babylonians for week days or for the discovery of planets. It may be mentioned that Alberuni (tr. by Sachau, vol. I, chap. XIX pp. 214-215) illustrates how week-days received names from planets, narrates (p. 215) that it was the custom with Hindus to enumerate the planets in the order of the weekdays and that the Hindus persisted in using these in their astronomical books and declined to use any other order or method even if it was more correct.
