CHAPTER XIX

Kalpa, Manvantara, Mahāyuga, Yuga

After dealing with time measures from _yuga_ ( of five years) down to weekdays and the day one must now briefly deal with the other measures of time such as Yuga, Mahāyuga, Manvantara and Kalpa. The word Kalpa has its germ in the R̥gveda [^1080] X. 190. 3, where it is said that the Creator created the Sun and the Moon, the heaven, the earth and mid-region as before.' The earliest datable reference to Kalpa is found in Aśoka's edicts e.g. the 4th Rock edict [^1081] at Girnar and Kalsi have 'āva savaṭa kapā' (yāyat saṁvartakalpam ) and 'āva kapam' in the 5th Rock Edict at Shahabazgarhi and Mansera. This establishes that the theories about the vast extent of Kalpa had been promulgated in India long before the third century B.C. The Buddhists also took over the theory of Kalpas as is clear from the Mahāparinibbānasutta III 53 'Vouchsafe, Lord, to remain during the Kalpa. Live on, O Blessed One, through the Kalpa for the good and happiness of the great multitudes &c.'.

The beliefs that in the dim past there was an ideally perfect society followed by a gradual degeneracy and decline in standards of morals, health and length of life and that the cycle of decline would be followed in the far distant future by a golden age of perfection in morals &c. have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 885 ff.

[^1080]: सूर्याचन्द्रमसौ धाता यथापूर्वमकल्पयत् । दिवं च पृथिवीं चान्तरिक्षमथो स्वः॥ ऋ. X. 190.3.

[^1081]: Vide Inscriptions of Aśoka in C. I. I. vol. I, pp. 6, 30 (text of 4th edict), and pp. 55, 74 ( text of 5th edict). In the Vanaparva 188, 69 it is said that fire called Saṁvartaka will assail the world while the Brahmapurāṇa (232. 39) says that terrible clouds called 'Saṁvartaka' will rise, when final dissolution (_pralaya_) will follow. Therefore, 'āva saṁvata kapā' means 'up to the end of Kalpa when destructive fire called saṁvartaka will arise' (or when terrible clouds called saṁvartaka will arise ). It may be noted that the Amara-kośa regards संवर्त, प्रलय, कल्प, क्षय and कल्पान्त as synonyms.

## Meanings of yuga

The word '_yuga_' has been shown there as having probably several meanings, viz. a short period of time (R̥g. III. 26.3 ), a cycle of five years and also a long period and a period of thousands of years. Prof. Mankad in Poona Orientalist ( vol. VI. pp. 211-212 ) assigns as many as ten meanings to the word. One cannot agree with him in all that he says. For example, he appears to be wrong when he says that in Śākuntala IV (yugāntaram ārūḍhaḥ savitā ) yuga means 1/4th of a day; yuga does not, so far as I know, mean 1/4th anywhere, it means 'four' in some cases. In Śākuntala 'yugāntara &c.' should be taken to mean that 'the sun has come up in the sky as much as the length of a yoke (from the eastern horizon)'. That is the sense of 'yuga' in R̥g. X, 60.8, X. 101. 3 and 4. In the Mahābhārata, in Manu and the Purāṇas the theory of _yugas, manvantaras and kalpas_ has been elaborated at great length. The four yugas are named Kr̥ta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Tiṣya or Kali and concern only Bhārata-varṣa. [^1081a] But it has been shown (at pp. 886-890 of the H. of Dh, vol. III.) that originally these were the names of certain throws of dice in gambling and that from the 4th century B.C. (if not earlier) they came to be the designations of the ages of man. The early Gupta inscriptions refer to Kr̥tayuga as a cycle of great virtues ( as in the Bilsad stone pillar Inscription of Kumāragupta in Gupta Saṁvat 96 in 'Gupta Inscriptions' p. 44, the Chammak copperplate of Vākāṭaka Pravarasena II in 'Gupta Inscriptions' p. 237, Pattan plates of Pravarasena II. in E. 1. 23 p. 81. The theory of Yugas, Manvantaras and Kalpas is elaborated among ancient works in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva, chapters 149, 158 and Śāntiparva, chap. 69 and 231-232 ), Manu I. 61-74, 79-86, Viṣṇudharmasūtra chap. 20. 1-21, Viṣṇupurāṇa 1.3, 6.3, Brahmapurāṇa 5. 229-232, Matsya 142-145, Vāyu chap. 21, 22, 57, 58, 100, Kūrma I. chap. 51 and 53, Brahmāṇḍa II. 6 and 31-36, III. 1, Mārkaṇḍeya 58 64, 66-70, 71-97 ( has the longest account of Manvantaras), and by astronomical writers and works such as Āryabhaṭa, Sūryasiddhānta, Brahmagupta, Siddhantaśiromani.

[^1081a]: <u> चत्वारि भारते वर्षे युगानि </u> मुनयो विदुः ।  कृतं त्रेता द्वापरं च तिष्यं चेति चतुर्युगम् ॥ वायु. 24. 1, 45. 137 (reads कवयो for मुनयो and कलिश्चेति चतुष्टयम् ), 57. 22; मत्स्य 142. 17-18 'चत्वारि भारते वर्षे युगानि ऋषयोऽब्रुवन् । कृतं त्रेता द्वापरं च कलिश्चैवं चतुर्युगम् ॥ पूर्वं कृतयुगं नाम ततस्रेताभिधीयते। द्वापरं च कलिश्चैव युगानि परिकल्पयेत् ॥'. Vide ब्रह्म 27. 64. 27. 64. Tradition gave slightly varying information about the end of the Dvāpara age. It is said that the war between the Kaurava and Pandava hosts was fought in the period of sandhyā between Dvāpara and Kali (Ādi, 2.13). Similarly, शल्य 60.25 (प्राप्तं कलियुगं विद्धि), वनपर्व 149. 38 say that Kaliyuga was very near when the Bhārata war was about to be fought (एतत्कलियुगं नामाचिराद्यत्प्रवर्तते). On the other hand, many of the Purāṇas say that Kaliyuga began the very day Kṛṣṇa finished his avatāra and went to heaven; वायु 99. 428-29, ब्रह्माण्ड III. 74. 241, मत्स्य 273. 49-50, विष्णु IV, 24. 110, भागवत XII.2.33;ब्रह्म 212.8 has the same idea in different words. Vide note 993 for quotations from some of these Purāṇas. The Mausalaparva 1.13 and 2.20 state that Kṛṣṇa passed away 36 years after the Bhārata war. In any case द्वापर came to an end immediately or a few years after the Bhārata war.

None of these works enables us to furnish a satisfactory explanation about the rise of this system of Kalpas, Manvantaras and Yugas. Pargiter (in AIHT p.175 ) thinks that the division into four ages had a historical basis. That may or may not be so. But what historical explanation can be offered about manvantaras and kalpas is not stated anywhere. The theory of yugas concerned only Bhāratavarṣa as stated in several Purāṇas. All these works contain the same general features but there are many divergences in details. As the Manusmr̥ti contains one of the oldest accounts, a summary of its remarks will be first set out. First, seven Manus are enumerated viz. Svāyambhuva, Svārociṣa, Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata, Cākṣuṣa and Vaivasvata. Then divisions of time from _nimeṣa_ are specified ( 18 nimeṣa = Kāṣṭhā, 30 Kāṣṭhās = Kalā, 30 Kalās = Muhūrta, 30 Muhūrtas = ahorātra ); it is then said that the human month is the day and night of pitṛs, the human year is divine _ahorātra_. Kr̥ta-yuga extends over 4000 [^1082] years, _sandhyā_ (twilight ) before it is 400 years, sandhyāṁsa after it is 400 years. The three other yugas Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali have respectively 3000, 2000, 1000 years and sandhyās and sandhyāṁśas together of respectively 600, 400 and 200 years. The four yugas thus come to 12000 years ( 4300 plus 3600 plus 2400 plus 1200 ); this is called the yuga of gods (i.e. this is the _divya_ measure ) and 1000 of these four come to one day of Brahmā and the same is the extent of the night of Brahmā. Seventy-one yugas of 12000 divine years each constitute a manvantara and Manu (I. 80) winds up by saying that manvantaras are numberless [^1083] and so are creations and dissolutions.

[^1082]: Manu I. 65-67 are the same as Śāntiparva 231. 15-17, Manu I. 65-66 are the same as Matsya 142. 5-6 (with slight variations), Madu I. 69-70 are the same as Śānti 231. 20-21, Vāyu 57. 23-24 and Matsya 142. 19-20. Manu I. 69 is same as Vanaparva 188. 22-23.

[^1083]: It was said by Manu (1. 81-82) that Kṛta was an age in which Dharma was four-footed and perfect, that in the other ages dharma declined successively by one foot, that theft, falsehood and fraud increase in proportion. Then Manu further avers (I. 83-86 ) that the length of human life in the four ages is respectively 400, 350, 200 and 100 years, that the set of duties differ in the four ages. Dharma is said to be four-footed because Manu VIII 16 identifies dharma with vṛṣa (bull). Both Plato and Aristotle believed that every art and science had many times developed to its apogee and then deteriorated.

## Kalpas and Manvantaras

It should be noticed that the word Kalpa does not occur in this long enumeration. But in other works than the Manusmr̥ti e.g. Viṣṇupurāṇa (V1.3. 11-12) fourteen Manvantaras are said to constitute a Kalpa, which is a day of Brahmā. As a day of the gods is equal to a human year, the 12000 years that constitute a divine _caturyuga_ are equal to 4320000 human year: [^1083a] (12000 x 360) i. e, this is the human (mānuṣa ) measure of time.

When and how these huge numbers of years for the yugas were suggested remains somewhat enigmatic. It appears that as early as the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa people had become familiar with huge figures. The Śatapatha [^1084] says that there are 10800 muhūrtas in a year (in one ahorātra 30 X 360), that Prajāpati arranged the Ṛgveda in such a way that the number of syllables it contains is equal to 12000 Bṛhatis ( each Bṛhati having 36 syllables ) i.e. 432000 syllables and it is further stated that the Ṛgveda also contains 10890 paṅktis (each paṅkti having 10 syllables i.e. the syllables are 10800 X 40 = 432000. Prajāpati is said to have arranged the other two Vedas also and the three Vedas amounted to ten thousand eight hundred eighties (that is 80 x 10800 = 864000 syilables ), that _muhūrta by muhūrta_ he gained eighty syllables (as there are 10800 _muhūrtas_ in a sacrificial year of 360 days).

[1083a]: Many ancient authors in almost all countries believed that there were different ages with differing levels of virtue and that they themselves lived in the worst age. Vide Hesiod's 'Works and days' pp. 11-17 (Loeb Classical Library) where Hesiod's own age was said to be the worst of five ages. The Babylonians made out 2160000 years for the duration of the world and imagined there were three ages, viz. golden, silver and copper, Vide pp, 33-34 of Maclean's 'Babylonian astrology in relation to the Old Testament'. Sarton also thinks that the Sumeriaas originated a golden age of man and speak of huge numbers of years, viz. 12,960,000 (PP. 69 and 118 of 'a History of Science'). Berossus gave a list of tea ante-deluvian kings reigning in all for 432000 years (see Cambridge Ancient History, 1923, vol. I. page 150 ). Vide Heath's 'Greek astronomy' (Introduction, p. XIV) re Egyptians' claim for possessing records of observations of stars for 630,000 years and a similar claim of Babylonians for 1,444,000 years,

[^1084]: स ऐक्षत प्रजापतिः। त्रय्यां वाव विद्यायां सर्वाणि भूतानि हन्त त्रयीमेव विद्यामात्मानमभिसंस्करवा इति ॥ स ऋचो व्यौहत् । द्वादश बृहतीसहस्राण्येतावत्यो हर्चो याः प्रजापतिसृष्टास्तास्त्रिंशत्तमे व्यूहे पंक्तिवतिष्ठन्त । ता यत्त्रिंशत्तमे व्यूहेऽतिष्ठन्त तस्मात्रिंशन्मासस्य रात्रयोऽथ यत्पंक्तिषु तस्मात्यांक्तः प्रजापतिस्ता अष्टाशतं शतानि पङ्क्त्योऽभवन् । अथेतरौ वेदौ व्यौहत् । ...ते सर्वे त्रयो वेदाः । दश च सहस्राण्यष्टौ च शतान्यशीतीनामभवत् स मुहूर्तेन मुहूर्तेनाशीतिमाप्नोत् । शतपथ X. 4. 2. 22, 23, 25.

Dr. Jean Filliozat, Professor at the College de France, Paris, puts forward the theory in a recent article (in the Bulletin of L'Ecole Francaise D'Extreme-Orient, Tome XLIV, Fas, 2, pp. 538-546 ) that the number of years in Kaliyuga ( 432000) was suggested by these figures in the Śatapatha, that the high figures in the ancient Indian literature are scientific and not astrological, and that in the opinion of Heraclitus 10800 ordinary human years were equal to one 'great year', that Berossus held that a great astronomical period was of 432000 years and that as the Śatapatha-brāhmana is far more ancient than both Heraclitus and Berossus, the borrowing, if it exists, must have been by the Greeks from India. Vide 'Ancient relations between Indian and foreign astronomical systems' by Dr. J. Filliozat in JOR, Madras, vol. XXV ( for 1957 ) pp. 1-8; also Prof. Zinner (in 'Stars above us' p. 59 ) for theories about the age of the world held by Plato and Berossus. One day of Brahmā is equal to a Kalpa i.e. 4320000 x 1000 i.e. 432,000,000,0. In order [^1085] to find out the human years of the one hundred years of Brahma's life we shall have to multiply 432,000,0000 by 2, then by 360 and then by 100. That is, the day and night of Brahmā come to 8640000000 human years; the year of Brahmā would then be equal to 3110400000000 human years ( taking 360 days as a year); one hundred years of Brahmā thus come to 311040000000000 years. Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I p. 332 ) also mentions this colossal figure about the life of Brahmā. Some said that the extent of Brahma's life was 108 years. Brahmā is said to have already lived 50 years and it is the second half of his life that is running and at present it is the Vārāha [^1086] Kalpa and Vaivasvata-manvantara [^1087] (7th ) that are going on.

[^1085]: A मन्वन्तर would mean 'अन्यः मनुः' or मनूनामन्तरमनकाशोऽवधिर्वा as क्षीरस्वामी explains. If 1000 महायुगs are divided by 14, each मन्वन्तर is equal to 71 महायुगs plus a little more (i.e. six mahāyugas divided by 14 ). Therefore, the विष्णुपुराण says 'चतुर्युगानां संख्याता <u>साधिका </u>ह्येकसप्ततिः । मन्वन्तरं मनोः कालः सुरादीनां च सत्तम ॥'I. 3.18; vide also ब्रह्माण्ड II. 6.19 and II 35 173. चतुर्युगसहस्रान्तं कल्पमाहुर्मनीषिणः । कूर्म II.45 49; चतुर्युगसहस्रं तु कथ्यते ब्रह्मणो दिनम् ॥ स कल्पस्तत्र मनवश्चतुर्दश महामुने । तदन्ते चैव मैत्रेय ब्राह्मो नैमित्तिको लयः॥ विष्णुपु. VI. 3. 11-12.

[^1086]: एकमस्य व्यतीतं तु परार्धं ब्रह्मणोऽनघ। तस्यान्तेऽभून्महाकल्पः पाद्म इत्यभिविश्रुतः॥ द्वितीयस्य परार्धस्य वर्तमानस्य वै द्विज । वाराह इति कल्पोयं प्रथमः परिकल्पितः ॥ विष्णुपुराण I. 3. 27-28.

[^1087]: The word 'मनु' frequently occurs in the Ṛgveda and other samhitās. Manu is often spoken of as the father of humanity and of the sages and as laying down the proper path for mankind. Vide : यानि मनुरवृणीता पिता नस्ता शं च योश्च रुद्रस्य वश्मि॥ ऋ. II. 33. 13; मा नः पथः पित्र्यान्मानवादधि दूरं नैष्ट परावतः ॥ ऋ. VIII. 30.3; वि यो रत्ना भजति मानवेन्यः श्रेष्ठं नो अत्र द्रविणं यथा दधत् ॥ ऋ. IV. 54. 1; यद्वै किं च मनुरवदत्तद्भेषजम् । तै. सं. II. 2. 10. 2, काठकसं. XI. 5. In the शतपथब्राह्मण ( I. 8. 1. 1) occurs the famous story of Manu and the deluge. Another story is that of Manu and his son Nābhānediṣṭha in ते.सं. III. 1. 9. 4-6 and ऐ. बा 22.9, Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 543.

## Past Manus

The past six Manus are Svāyambhuva, Svārociṣa, Uttama, Tāmasa, Raivata, Cākṣuṣa and the present is Vaivasvata, the 7th Manu (Brahma 5. 4-5, Kūrma I. 51. 4-5, Viṣṇu III. 1. 6–7). The remaining seven Manus are differently named in several Purāṇas e. g. Viṣṇu (III. 2. 14 ff) and Narasimhapurāṇa 24. 17–35 mention the future Manus as Sāvarṇi, Dakṣa Sāvarṇi, Brahmasāvarṇi, Dharmasāvarnika, Rudra-sāvarṇi, Ruci and Bhauma; while Brahma (5. 5-6 ) mentions four of the future seven as Sāvarṇi, Raibhya, Raucya, Merusāvarni. Kūrma (I. 53. 30–31) names the future four in the same way as Viṣṇu (only substituting Savarṇa for Sāvarni wherever it occurs and the last two as Raucya and Bhautya). All the fourteen Manus are enumerated in Nāradapurāṇa I, 40. 20–23. Alberuni (tr. by Sachau, vol. I. chap. XLIV p. 387 ) gives the names of Manvantaras according to the Viṣṇudharmottara, Viṣṇupurāṇa and other sources. Sāvarṇya [^1088] Manu as a great benefactor and leader of some territory occurs in R̥g. X. 62. 11. It is said that each Manvantara had a separate set of sages, sons of Manu, gods, kings, smr̥tis, Indra and guardians for the proper regulation of dharma and for the protection of the people (Brahma 5. 39, Viṣṇupurāṇa III. chapters 1-2). In the Viṣṇupurāṇa it is said that some gods remain for four yugas, some for a manvantara and some stay for a kalpa.[^1088a] The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (chap. XX. 1-15 ) has the same account of Manvantaras and Kalpas as Manu's but it adds one detail viz. that the whole ago of Brahmā is equal to a day of Puruṣa ( Viṣṇu) and the night of Puruṣa is also as long. It is remarkable that the same view is attributed by Alberuni (Sachau vol. I. p. 332 ) to the Puliśasiddhānta. It is not known whether those European scholars who regard Puliśa to be Paulus Alexandrinus have shown that this detail occurs in the work of the Greek Astrologer Paulus.

[^1088]: सहस्रदा ग्रामणीर्मा रिषन्मनुः सूर्येणास्य यतमानतु दक्षिणा । सावर्णेदेवाः प्रतिरन्त्वायुर्यस्मिन्नश्रान्ता असनाम वाजम् ॥ ऋ. x 62. 11. In ऋ. x. 62 9 the gifts made by सावर्ण्य are mentioned. The भागवतपुराण (XII. 7. 15) says 'मन्वन्तरं मनुर्देवाः मनुपुत्राः सुरेश्वरः । ऋषयोंशावतारश्च हरेः षड्विधमुच्यते ॥"

[^1088a]: केचिञ्चतुर्युगं यावत्केचिन्मन्वन्तरं सुराः । तिष्ठन्ति भवतो दत्ता मया बै कल्पसंस्थितिः ॥ विष्णुपु. I. 12. 93.

In the Vanaparva ( 188. 22-29 ) the same account as in Manu occurs except this that 12000 years are called _Yuga_ [^1089] simply and not caturyuga (as in Manu I. 71 ). The Mārkaṇḍeya has a long story about Svārocisa in chapters 58-65, devotes to Uttama chap. 66-70, chapter 71 to Tāmasa, chap. 72 to Raivata, chap. 73 to Cākṣuṣa, chap. 74-76 to Vaivasvata, chap. 77 to Sāvarṇi, chap. 78-90 to Devi, chap. 91-95 to Raucya or Ruci, chap. 96-97 to Bhautya. The word 'Vaivasvata'(son of Vivasvat, the Sun) is applied to Yama in several passages of the Ṛgveda (X. 14. 1, X. 58. 1, X. 60. 10, X. 164.2). The Anukramaṇi, however, ascribes R̥g. VIII. 27-31 to Vaivasvata Manu as the _ṛṣi_ and in one of the Vālakhilya hymns (R̥g. X. 52. 1) occurs the following verse 'O Indra! just as you drank the soma extracted in (the sacrifice of) Manu Vivasvat, just as you frequently accept the hymn of praise in ( sacrifice of) Trita, so may you simultaneously delight in ( the soma and praise) of Ayu.' [^1090] It may be noted that the Manusmr̥ti names only the seven Manus ( I. 61-63) and states that each Manu during his own time (which extended over thousands of years ) created the movable and immovable world and protected it, that Manvantaras are numberless ( Manusmr̥ti I. 80) and that the Great God (Parameṣṭhin) brought about the creation and destruction of the world during the Manvantaras. Some of the Purāṇas such as Matsya (9. 37-39, 142. 40, 144. 97-98), Vāyu (59. 34), Agni (150.21), Viṣṇu ( I. 3 and VI. 3) state [^1090a] that Manu and the seven sages in each Manvantara (i.e. where there is a change of Manu) who are the siṣṭas that then exist are devoted to dharma, being ordered by Brahmā for the purpose of continuing the worlds, declare the truth and promulgate the Vedas.

[^1089]: सहस्रयुगपर्यन्तमहर्यद्ब्रह्मणो विदुः। रात्रि युगसहस्रान्तां तेऽहोरात्रविदो जनाः ॥ शान्ति. 23. 31 and गीता VIII. 17. The word युग is often used to denote the 12000 years of divine measure as in वनपर्व 188. 38 'एषा द्वादशसाहस्री युगाख्या परिकीर्तिता ॥'.

[^1090]: यथा मनौ विवस्वति सोमं शक्रापिबः सुतम् । यथा त्रिते छन्द इन्द्र जुजोषस्यायौ मादयसे सचा ॥ ऋ. VIII. 52. 1 (4th बालखिल्यसूक्त).

[^1090a]: अतीतानागताश्चैते मनवः परिकीर्तिताः। ...स्वे स्वेऽन्तरे सर्वमिदमुत्पाद्य सचराचरम् । कल्पक्षये विनिवृत्ते मुच्यन्ते ब्रह्मणा सह । एते युगसहस्रान्ते विनश्यन्ति पुनः पुनः। मत्स्य 9. 37-39; मन्वन्तरेषु ये शिष्टा इह तिष्ठन्ति धार्मिकाः। मनुः सप्तर्षयश्चैव लोकसन्तानकारणात् । धर्मार्थे ये च शिष्टा वै याथातथ्यं प्रचक्षते। वायु. 59. 34; प्रवर्तयन्ति वेदांश्च भुवि सप्तर्षयो दिवः। अग्नि. 150. 21; the मत्स्यपुराण (142. 29-32) calculates the numbers of years in a मन्वन्तर as follows : 'एषा चतुर्युगाख्या तु साधिका त्वेकसप्ततिः । कृतत्रेतादियुक्ता सा मनोरन्तरमुच्यते ॥ मन्वन्तरस्य संख्या तु मानुषेण निबोधत । एकत्रिंशत्तथा कोट्यः संख्याता संख्यया द्विजैः। तथा शतसहस्राणि दश चान्यानि भागशः । सहस्राणि तु द्वात्रिंशच्छतान्यष्टाधिकानि च ।। अशीतिश्चैव वर्षाणि मासाश्चैवाधिकास्तु षट् । मन्वन्तरस्य संख्यैषा मानुषेण प्रकीर्तिता॥; vide ब्रह्माण्ड (II. 35. 164-165) which differs slightly from this.

## Manu and Saptarṣis

Some modern writers (like Dr. Daftari ) think [^1090b] that in ancient times there was an Indian institution of public functionaries called Manu and the Saptarṣis, whose function was to legislate and promulgate the Vedas. With great respect to the erudite scholar, I disagree with him. The extant Purāṇa passages are less than 2000 years old, while the present Vaivasvata Manvantara started several millions of years ago and even Kaliyuga in which we are deemed to live started in 3102 B.C. Besides, there is a dissolution of the world at each day of Brahmā, if one is to rely on the Paurāṇik accounts. How could a tradition of the several Manus survive such pralaya? A rationalistic interpretation requires that all this that is stated in the Purāṇas is mere conjecture and imagination and that one cannot safely build theories about the governance of society in ancient times on the accounts contained in Purāṇas. The Manusmști (11, 19 ) appears to assign the function of the regulation of the conduct of all men in the world to the learned brāhmaṇas born in Brahmarṣideśa (i.e. Kurukṣetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcāla and Surasena or Mathura) at least after his own code was promulgated.

Pessimistic and dismal accounts of what will happen in Kaliyuga ( which extends according to the Purāṇas over 432000 years and of which only about 5057 years have gone by this time in 1956 ) are set forth in the Vanaparva, chap. 188, 190, Sānti parva 69. 80-97, the Harivaṁśa (Bhaviṣyaparva, chap. 3-5 ff.), Brahmapurāṇa chap. 229-230, Vāyu chap. 58 and 99 verses 391-428, Matsya 144. 32-47, Kurma I. 30, Viṣṇupurāṇa VI. 1, Bhāgavata XII. 1-2, Brahmānda II. 31 and in several other purāṇas. The description in Vanaparva 188 is summarised in H. of Dh. vol. III pp. 893-895. The names of 33 Kalpas are given in Vāyu, chap. 21-23 and Hemādri on Kāla (pp. 670-671 ) sets out from Nāgarakhaṇḍa the names of 33 Kalpas and the tithis on which they start; Matsya 290 enumerates thirty names of Kalpas; the Brahmāṇda Il. 31. 119 states that there are 35 Kalpas and neither more nor less.

[^1090b]: Vide "The rationalistic and realistic interpretation of the Upanishads' (pp. 2 and 3 ) published at Nagpur in 1958.

In the purāṇas _pralaya_ is said to be of four sorts, [^1091] viz. _nitya_ ( the every day deaths of those that are born), _naimittika_ (when a day of Brahmā ends, then there is a dissolution of the world), _prākrtika_ ( when everything dissolves itself into prakr̥ti, primordial substance) and _ātyantika_ pralaya is _Mokșa_ (liberation of the soul due to correct knowledge of Reality and absorption into the Supreme Spirit). Harrowing descriptions of the naimittika and prākṛtika pralayas are given in several purāṇas. A lengthy description of the naimittika dissolution is contained in Kūrma II. 45. 11-59 of which a brief summary is given here. When the one thousand Caturyugas end, there is the absence of rain for a hundred years; the result is that living beings perish and are reduced to earth; the sun's rays become unbearable, and even the ocean is dried up; the earth is burnt by the fierce heat of the sun together with its mountains, forests and continents. As the sun's rays fall burning up everything, the whole world presents the appearance of one huge fire. Fire burns everything whether mobile or immoveable. The animals in the big seas come out and are reduced to ashes. Then the saṁvartaka fire growing by the force of the wind burns the whole earth and its flames rise up to a height of thousands of _yojanas_ and the flames burn up _gandharvas_, goblins, _yakṣas_, serpents and rākṣasas and not only the earth but the worlds called 'bhuvaḥ' and 'mahaḥ' are burnt; then huge saṁvartaka clouds resembling herds of elephants, lit up by lightning, rise in the sky, some looking like blue lotuses, some yellowish, some having the colour of smoke, some like sealing wax and fill the whole sky and then extinguish the fires by sending down heavy showers. When the fires are extinguished, the clouds of destruction cover the whole world with floods; mountains are concealed and the earth is plunged in waters and all becomes one ocean of water and then god Brahmā resorts to _Yogic_ sleep. Vanaparva ( chap. 273. 32-48) also contains a brief description of _naimittika pralaya_.

## Description of prākr̥tika pralaya

The Kūrma I. 46 and Viṣṇu VI. 4. 12-49 furnish a description of the _prākr̥tika pralaya_ which takes Sāṅkhya terminology for granted, [^1092] and is briefly as follows: when all the worlds including all the nether regions are destroyed by absence of rains and all effects from _mahat_ onwards are destroyed, waters first absorb the _gandha_ (the special quality of the earth ) and when _gandha-tanmātra_ is destroyed, the earth is reduced to water; the special quality of waters, viz. _rasa-tanmātra_ is destroyed and nothing but fire remains and the whole world is filled with flames, then Vāyu absorbs fire and _rūpa-tanmātra_ vanishes ; Vāyu shakes all the ten quarters; ākāśa absorbs the _sparśa-guṇa_ of Vāyu and only ākāśa remains as a void and _śabda-tanmātra_ is gone and in this way the seven prakr̥tis including _mahat_ and _ahaṅkāra_ are absorbed in order; even Prakr̥ti and Puruṣa are dissolved in Paramātman ( named Viṣṇu). The day of Viṣṇu is said to be two Parārdhas of human years.

Some works like the Harivaṁśa (Bhaviṣyaparva chap. 10. 12-68) provide that at the end of Kalpa the sage Mārkaṇḍeya alone remains and lies at the time of the pralaya (or kalpa) in the side of Lord Viṣṇu and then comes out of His mouth. The Brahmapurāṇa ( 52.1--19 and 53. 55) says that Mārkaṇḍeya sees a _vaṭa_ tree at the end of Kalpa and a jewelled bed on which he sees a boy lying down (i.e. Viṣṇu himself ) and then he enters the side of that boy and later comes out. Vide also Matsya 167 (14-66) for the same story in almost the same words. The Bhagavadgitā (VIII. 18-19) speaks of the recurrent absorption of all beings at the advent of the night of Brahmā and reappearance of beings when the day of Brahmā starts.

The theory of yugas, manyantaras and kalpas with their fabulous numbers of years and harrowing descriptions of pralaya, appears unreal, bizarre and called up by sheer fancy. But underlying it there is the idea of the timelessness of the universe, though from time to time it evolves, gradually declines and perishes, only to reappear in perfection after a cosmic night. There is also the hankering after Reality and pursuit of different ideals. It enshrines the ideas that humanity embarks on a certain goal, pursues it with great efforts and, after achieving some success, gives up that goal and the way that was thought to lead to it and pursues some other goal for aeons in the hope that at some distant date it will be able to evolve and construct a perfect society.

[^1092]: For the सांख्यतत्त्वs, vide सांख्यकारिका 3 'मूलप्रकृतिरविकृतिर्महदाद्याः प्रकृतिविकृतयः सप्त । षोडशकश्च विकारो न प्रकृतिर्न विकृतिः पुरुषः॥'. महत् , अहङ्कार and पञ्चतन्मात्रs are of a double nature i.e both प्रकृति and विकृति. The sixteen ( which are merely products and not causes) are five कर्मेन्द्रियs, five ज्ञानेन्द्रियः, five mahābhūtas ( पृथिव्यप्तेजोवाय्वाकाश) and मनः .

These ideas are at the bottom of what Manu [^1093] and others say 'Tapas was the highest goal (deemed to yield great results ) in Kr̥tayuga, knowledge (of the self) was the highest in Tretā, yajña (sacrifices to God) in Dvāpara, charity alone in Kali'. This further implies that there are different impelling motives in different ages and modern men should not assess the actions and ideals of past ages by the same yardstick that is applied to contemporary actions and ideals. It is implicit in the words of Manu (XI.301 ) that the four ages are not water-tight specific periods of time, but that the Ruler or Government can produce conditions of Kr̥ta age in what is popularly called Kali by appropriate conduct or measures and Medhātithi expressly says so. [^1093a] Prof. Mankad has a novel theory in a paper on the manvantaras in I. H. Q. vol XVIII, pp. 208–230, where he states that the Caturyuga formula took 40 years for a ruling unit and not for one king's regnal period and that the manvantara was the regular method of calculating regnal periods of different kings in a dynasty (p. 237 ). Hardly any scholar has accepted this theory and for reasons of space and relevance, it is not possible to discuss it here.

## Āryabhaṭa and Brahmagupta

In the details about the theory of yugas, manvantaras and kalpas there are some divergences. A few may be pointed out. Āryabhaṭa appears to hold that the extent of each of the four yugas was the same and not in the traditional proportion of 4, 3, 2, 1, when he says that he was twenty-three years old when three _yugapādas_ and 3600 years had elapsed (vide Kālakriyāpāda 10 quoted in note 995 above ). Brahmagupta (I. 9) says [^1094] that, though Āryabhaṭa declared that the four pādas of yugas, viz. Kr̥ta and the others, were equal, not one of them was equal to what the smr̥tis declare them to be. There is another discrepancy also.

[^1093]: तपः परं कृतयुगे त्रेतायां ज्ञानमुच्यते । द्वापरे यज्ञमेवाहुर्दानमेकं कलौ युगे॥ मनु I. 86 = शान्ति 23. 28 = वायुपुराण 8. 65-66, पराशरस्मृत्ति I. 23. बायु reads ध्यानं परं कृतयुगे and दानं कलियुगे वरम्. The ब्रह्माण्ड (II. 7. 59 ) says 'ज्ञानं परं कृतयुगे त्रेतायां यज्ञ उच्यते । प्रवृत्तं द्वापरे युद्धं स्तेयमेव कलौ युगे॥'

[^1093a]: 'कृतं त्रेता युगं चैव द्वापरं कलिरेव च। राज्ञो वृत्तानि सर्वाणि राजा हि युगमुच्यते॥' मनु XI. 301; 'न चैवं मन्तव्यं राज्ञा कलिर्नाम  कालविशेष इतिहासप्रसिद्धः कथमहं स्यामिति यतो राज्ञो वृत्तानि युगादि' मेधातिथि.

[^1094]: युगपादानार्यभटश्चत्वारि समानि कृतयुगादीनि। यदभिहितवान्न तेषां स्मृत्युक्तसमानमेकमपि ॥ ब्राह्मस्फुटसि. I 9. दिव्यं वर्षसहस्रं ग्रहसामान्यं द्विषट्कगुणम् । <u>अष्टोत्तरं सहस्रं ब्राह्मो दिवसो ग्रहयुगानाम् </u>॥ आर्यभटीय, कालक्रियापाद 8. This means '12000 divine years make a yuga of all the _planets_; 1008 times of planetary yugas are equal to a day of Brahmā. ' मनुसन्धिं युगमिच्छत्यार्यभटस्तन्मनुर्यतः श्खयुगः । <u>कल्पश्चतुर्युगानां सहस्रनष्टाधिकं तस्य </u>॥ ब्राह्मस्फुटसिद्धान्त I. 12. The words 'तन्मनुः ... श्खयुगः ' pointedly refer to the Gītikāpāda verse q. above in note 1071.

Āryabhaṭa in his Daśagitikā Verse 3 states that Manu is a period of 72 yugas, while all the smr̥tis and purāṇas declare that a manvantara is equal to 71 yugas. Āryabhata appears to have held that the day of Brahmā is equal to 1008 _caturyugas_ and Brahmagupta ( I. 12) refers to this view. The celebrated scientific astronomer Bhāskarācārya [^1095] (born in śaka 1036, 1114 A. D.) impatiently says 'some say that half of the life of Brahmā (i.e. 50 years ) has passed away, while others say that half plus eight years has passed away. Whatever the true tradition may be, it is of no use, since planetary positions are to be established from the days that have passed in the current day of Brahmā.'

As incidental to the colossal figures of the years of Kalpas and Yugas, a few words on numerals, their antiquity and the methods of writing numerals would not be out of place, In the Ṛgveda numerals from 1 to 10 are frequently used. 'Sahasra' (thousand) and' ayuta'( ten thousand) occur in R̥g. IV. 26.7, VIII. 1. 5, VIII. 21 18. One of these says [^1096] 'O wielder of thunderbolt! O immensely rich (Indra)! I shall not give thee away even for a big price, not for a thousand, not for ten thousand, nor for hundreds'. In R̥g. VIII. 46.22 a poet says 'I secured 60000 and several tens of thousands of horses, 20 hundreds of camels, one thousand dark coloured mares and ten thousands of cows bright in three parts of their bodies.' In R̥g. I. 53. 9 Indra is said to have struck down sixty thousand and 99 enemies. Vide R̥g. I. 126. 3 (for sixty thousand cows), VIII, 4. 20 and VIII. 46. 29 for 60000 and VI. 63. 10 for one hundred thousand horses. In some of these the larger numbers are mentioned first and the smaller ones next (as in R̥g. I. 53. 9, VIII. 46. 22 ); in others it is the reverse. No conclusion can therefore be drawn that the smaller numbers come first in the R̥gvedic times. In Tai. S. IV. 4. 11. 3-4 reference is made to bricks in numbers from one, one hundred, thousand, ayuta ( ten thousand), niyuta, prayuta, arbuda, nyarbuda, samudra, madhya, anta and parārdha, while in Tai. S. VII. 2. 11-19 various numbers from one to one thousand are mentioned and in VII. 2. 20 numbers from śata, sahasra up to _parārdha_ as in IV. 1. 11. 3-4 are expressed.

[^1095]:  तथा वर्तमानस्य कस्यायुषोर्धं गतं सार्धवर्षाष्टकं केचिदूचुः । भवत्वागमः कोपि नास्योपयोगो ग्रहा वर्तमानद्ययातात् प्रसाध्याः ॥ सि. शि. I. 26.

[^1096]: महे च न त्वामद्रिवः परा शुल्काय देयाम् । न सहस्राय नायुताय वज्जिवो न शताय शतामघ ॥ ऋ. VIII. 1. 5; षष्टिं सहस्राश्न्यस्यायुतासनमुष्ट्राणां विंशतिं शता। दश श्यावीनां शता दश त्र्यरुषीणां दश गवां सहस्रा॥ ऋ VIII. 46. 22.

In Vāj. S. 17. 2 bricks from one, ten, hundred up to _parārdha_ ( which is the 13th order therein) are referred to as in Tai. S. IV. 4. 11. 3-4. Kāṭhaka 17. 10 is the same as Tai. S. V. 4. 11. 3-4 (from 'Sahasrasya pramā asi' to 'iṣṭakā dhenavaḥ santu' ). These references show that names for astronomical numbers of years had been settled at least more than a thousand years before Christ. One should like to know the names of numbers in Greece corresponding to the words from _arbuda_ onwards. The Nirukta (III. 10) gives the derivation of eka, dvi, tri, catur, aṣṭa, nava, daśa, viṁśati, śata, sahasra, ayuta, niyuta, prayuta, arbuda. Pāṇini (V. 1. 59 ) mentions _paṅkti_ ( ten), viṁśati, triṁśat, catvāriṁśat, pañcāśat, saṣṭi, saptati, aśīti, navati and śata and the Mahābhāṣya on the 4th vārtika on that sūtra mentions sahasra, ayuta and arbuda among numbers. In Sabhāparva [^1097] numbers from _ayuta_ to _parārdha_ are mentioned as noted below. Āryabhaṭa mentions [^1098] only ten orders from _eka_ to _arbuda_ (hundred million) and vrnda ( thousand million). The Vāyupurāṇa (101. 93-102) mentions the 18 orders of numbers from one to _parārdha_ in a slightly confused manner. It may be noted that the ancient Greeks had no single word for million.

The Viṣṇupurāṇa [^1099] states that parārdha is 18th order of numbers from one, each order being ten times as much as its predecessor. The 18 orders or units of reckoning as employed for many centuries in India are set out here. [^1100]

[^1097]: अयुतं प्रयुतं चैत्र शङ्कुं पद्मं तथार्बुदम् । खर्वं शङ्खं निखर्वं च महापद्मं च कोटयः । मध्यं चैव परार्धं च सपरं चात्र पण्यताम् । सभापर्व 65.3-4 (Yudhisthira says this when he was about to indulge in a gambling bout). Here the orders are not all serially named and — 'niyuta' and 'antya' are wanting.

[^1098]: एकं दश च शतं च सहस्रमयुतनियुते तथा प्रयुतम् । कोट्यर्बुदं च वृन्दं स्थानात्स्थानं दशगुणं स्यात् ॥ आर्यभटीय, गणितपाद 2. The meaning is ' the numbers eka...vṛnda are from place to place each ten times of the preceding.'

[^1099]: स्थानात्स्थानं दशगुणमेकस्माद्गण्यते द्विज । ततोष्टादशमे भागे परार्धमभिधीयते॥ परार्धद्विगुणं यत्तु प्राकृतः स लयो द्विज । तदाऽव्यक्तेऽखिलं व्यक्तं स्वहेतौ लयमेति वै॥ विष्णुपुराण VI. 3. 4-5 (one edition reads द्वादशमे for अष्टादशमे ); शतमाहुः परिदृढं सहस्रं परिपद्मकम् । विज्ञेयमयुतं तस्मान्नियुतं प्रयुतं ततः ॥ अर्बुदं न्यर्बुदं चैव स्वर्बुदं च ततः स्मृतम् । खर्वं चैव निखर्वे च शङ्कं पद्मं तथैव च । समुद्रं मध्यम चैव परार्धमपरं ततः। एवमष्टादशैतानि स्थानानि गणनाविधौ ॥ वायु 101. 100-102. In the verses from 94 onwards it says : अयुत = दशसहस्राणि, नियुत = शतसहस्र, अर्बुद = दशकोट्यः, अब्ज = कोटिशतं, खर्व = कोटि सहस्रं, निखर्व = दशकोटिसहस्राणि, शङ्कु = कोटिसहस्रशत, समुद्र = कोटीसहस्राणां सहस्रं ).

[^1100]: एकदशशतसहस्रायुतलक्षप्रयुतकोटयः क्रमशः। अर्बुदमब्जं खर्वनिखर्वमहापद्मशङ्कव स्तस्मात् ॥ जलधिश्चान्त्यं मध्यं परार्धमिति दशगुणोत्तराः संज्ञाः । संख्यायाः स्थानानां व्यवहारार्थे कृताः पूर्वैः॥ लीलावती (परिभाषा, 10-11).

## Words for Numbers in Sanskrit

1. Eka      10. Abja or Padma.
2. Daśa     11. Kharva.
3. Śata     12. Nikharva.
4. Sahasra  13. Mahāpadma.
5. Ayuta    14. Śaṅku.
6. Lakṣa    15. Jaladhi or Samudra.
7. Prayuta  16. Antya.
8. Koti     17. Madhya.
9. Arbuda   18. Parārdha.

Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I. p. 175 ) mentions 'nyarbuda' in place of 'arbuda' and changes the sequence of the last three as 'madhya, antya, parārdha'. Herein he appears to have followed the Vāyu and other purāṇas. Aparārka p. 413 notes verses about the 18 _sthānas_ in which 'niyuta' occurs for ten laksas (and not prayuta), Vr̥nda for 'Abja' or 'Padma'; 'Śaṅkha' and 'Padma' for 'Mahāpadma' and 'Śaṅku'.

That the decimal system itself goes back thousands of years from the present follows from the references in the Saṁhitās. But the question whether the _decimal_ positional or _place value_ system prevailed in Vedic times is rather a different and difficult one. It is generally [^1101] admitted that the place value decimal system that now prevails in Europe and all modern countries was Indian in origin and was introduced about the 12th century A. D. in Europe by the Arabs who borrowed it from India.

[^1101]: Vide Colebrooke's Miscellaneous Essays, vol. II, pp. 504-517 (references to Indian Astronomer visiting Al Mansur's court in 773 A. D.): Alberuni's 'India' (tr. by Sachau, vol. II, pp. 312-313 ) and Preface pp. XXXII-XXXVI; 'a History of Mathematics' by Cajori (1913) pp. 88 and 100. Mr. G. R. Kaye, who in many of his writings assumes the role of doubter and iconoclast, claims (in J. A. S. B. N S. vol. III, pp. 475-508) that he has proved that this idea about India being the originator of the place value notation now prevalent in Europe is not well founded and must be re-opened and re-examined. In spite of him Prof. Neugebauer in E.S.A, says that the Hindu-Arabic numerals were introduced in Europe in the 12th century A. D. (p 4) and Prof. Filliozat on 'Scientific thought in Ancient India' in East and West, vol. VI. No.4 pp. 285-292 says at p. 291 that Europeans owe to India the popularisation of the decimal system and also the trigonometric sine. Vide also I, H. Q, vol. III. pp. 97-120 and 356–375 on 'Origin and development of numerals' by Sukumar Ranjan Das, Bulletin of the Calcutta Mathematical Society, vol XVII pp 195–202 by Saradakant Ganguly On 'Āryabhaṭa's alphabet and Greeks', Bhāratakaumudi vol. I. pp 253-258, 'Hindu Arabic numerals' by W. E, Clark, pp. 217-236 in Lanman Presentation volume and 'Hindu Arabic numerals' by Smith and Carspinki (1911).

The decimal place value notation is said to be one of the most fertile inventions of man. There is a good deal of literature on this subject which is passed over here as not material for our purpose. One of the latest works on this system is 'From Zero to Infinity' by Constance Reid (Routledge and Kegan Paul, London, 1956). Zero is the first of ten symbols with which one can represent an infinitude of numbers and it is also the first of the numbers. This work says that the zero escaped even the greatest Greeks, Pythagoras, Euclid and Archimedes (p. 4). The Egyptians [^1102] had a decimal system of numerals but no sign for zero and therefore no positional notation, which even the Greeks did not know; ancient Babylonians also had no definite symbol for zero and there is no example of zero signs at the end of numbers even in their latest astronomical writings. It is difficult to say when exactly a symbol or word for zero was employed in India. But it must have been several centuries before the beginning of the Christian era. Pingala's work on metres is a _vedāṅga_. Piṅgala's sūtra on metres makes use of zero (śūnya ) in VIII. 28-31. Even the Śatapatha Br. (XI. 4. 3 20) seems to be aware of Vedāṅgas. But it may be argued that there is nothing to show that Piṅgala's work was known to it.

[^1102]: Vide 'Legacy of Egypt' (Glanville p. 166), E S. A. by Neugebauer p. 20, Sarton in 'a History of Science' p. 69; Prof. Neugebauer in JAOS. vol. 61 pp. 213-215 avers that strong arguments exist for the assumption that the Babylonian methods of calculation went, together with Greek Astronomy, to India, and that, sometime in the first centuries of the Christian era, the corresponding decimal place value notation in India, which through the Arabs gave rise to the modern system of Europe. With great respect the author must demur to these assertions, The learned writer endeavours to show that a peculiar sign was used for zero in Mesopotamian cuneiform texts. The important questions that must be answered are; who discovered the symbol for zero now used almost throughout the world, whether the so-called sign for zero which Prof. Neugebauer asserts he has discovered in cuneiform texts was ever used in Europe or for that matter anywhere in the world except in Mesopotamia, what direct relation exists between the Indian zero symbol and the recently discovered zero symbol ( which no one had found so far ), whether the symbols for 1 to 9 in India bear any resemblance to the Mesopotamian symbols for these numbers, whether the Greeks (who admittedly borrowed many things from Mesopotamia ) used the Mesopotamian zero symbol and, if so, when. The 19th century was distinguished by the theories of Western Scholars claiming that science, pbilosophy and arts began in Greece and that other nations borrowed these from the Greeks. That bubble of Greek primacy in these matters has now been pricked. The twentinth century appears to be heading for giving to Mesopotamia the place once assigned to the Greeks. The Mesopotamian bubble raised by some scholars may be pricked in course of time, particularly as regards others borrowing from them.

## Several methods of writing numerals

It is most probably mentioned as Chandoviciti in the Āpastamba-dharmasūtra [^1103] Śabara [^1104] (about 200 A. D. and not later than 400 A. D.) speaks of Piṅgala's work as on the same level with Pāṇini's sūtra. It is unnecessary to offer further proofs of the antiquity of Piṅgala's sūtra.

There were several methods of writing numerals. One was the place value notation, in which the same numeral has different values according to the place it occupies; for example, the figure two may have the value of only two or twenty or two hundred and so on according as it occupies the units place or tens place or hundreds place. Another way is that of employing words to denote complete numbers. This was a very reliable method when in astronomy huge figures had to be employed and works were not printed but only copied by hand. In ancient times, the writers of mss. might often omit zeros or other figures, but if words with a fixed meaning in relation to numbers were used, they would not be so easily dropped and as many works were metrical, the omission of a word, if any, might have been far more easily detected. It is difficult to say when this system was introduced. But its beginnings are ancient. For example, the word _kr̥ta_ -is used in the Taittiriya [^1105] Brāhmaṇa in the sense of 'four'. Varāhamihira (beginning of the 6th century A. D.) employs these word numerals but in the place value system (vide H. of Dh. vol. III, p. 897 n. 1763.) The following is a list of some of the very usual numbers with the corresponding words employed to indicate them. It should be noted that the list is not exhaustive. Any number of synonyms [^1106] may be employed to indicate the same number. Vide the lists in Alberuni ( Sachau, vol. I. pp. 174-179 ) and Bühler's 'Indian Paleography' (I. A. vol. 33; appendix pp. 83-86 ).

[^1107a]: 'पङ्क्तिविंशतित्रिंशञ्चत्वारिंशत्पञ्चाशत्षष्टिसप्तत्यशीतिनवतिशतम् ।' पा. VI. 1.

[^1108]: There is a 'षोडशराजकीय' section in द्रोणपर्व chap. 55-71 (16 ancient kings named Marutta, Suhotra, Paurava &c. ) Aṣṭi is a Vedic metre, each of its four pādas having 16 letters as in R̥g. II. 22.1; Atyaṣṭi is another Vedic metre with 68 letters in four pādas; Dhr̥ti, Atidhr̥ti Kr̥ti, Prakr̥ti, and ākr̥ti have respectively 72, 76, 80, 84, 88 letters in all pādas, The R̥kprātiśākhya ( 16. 83-90) says उत्तराष्टिश्वतुषष्टिः । ततोऽष्टाषष्टिरस्यष्टिः । धृतिः पूर्वा द्विसप्ततिः । षट्सप्ततिस्त्वतिधृतिः । कृतिः प्रकृतिराकृतिर्विकृतिः सङ्कृतिस्तथा । षष्ठी चाभिकृतिर्नाम सप्तम्युत्कृतिरुच्यते । अशीतिश्चतुरशीतिरष्टाशीतिर्द्विनवतिः ।.... ed by Mangal Deva Shastri, Allahabad (1931).

The above method of employing particular significant words to denote certain numbers even in decimal place value system is largely employed by Varāhamihira in his Pañcasiddhāntikā (e. g. I. 8 in note 1004 above, VIII. 1) and in Br̥hat-samhitā 8. 20 and by all later astronomical writers. [^1109] The particular matter to be noted is that the first word in a group (denoting a number) is to be assigned to the units place, the next to its left in the tens place, so that a word like 'saptāśvi-veda-saṅkhyam' becomes 427 (by the rule 'ankānām vāmato gatiḥ').

Another method for expressing numbers is elaborated by Āryabhaṭa in his Daśagitikāpāda [^1110] ( verse 3) where the letters from _k_ ( kā also ) to _m_ have the values of 1 to 25, while _ya, ra, la, va, śa, șa, sa and ha_ stand for 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 and so on towards more complicated matters.

The fourth _aṅga_ in a pañcāṅga is called _Yoga_. There is no direct astronomical phenomena corresponding to it. It is calculated from the sum of the longitudes of the Sun and the Moon (or it is the time during which the sun and the moon together accomplish 13 degrees and 20 minutes of space). When this amounts to degrees 13.20 the first Yoga called Viskambha ends; when it amounts to 26.40 the 2nd Yoga Prīti ends and so on. The yogas are 27 ( that thus make 360 degrees ) as stated in the Ratnamālā IV. 1-3 and are as follows :

Name         Deity         Name      Deity  
----         -----         ----      -----
1. Viskambha — Yama.    15. Vajra - Varuṇa.
2. Priti - Viṣṇu.       16. Siddhi --Ganesa.
3. Āyuṣmat-Candra.      17. Vyatīpāta --Śiva.
4. Saubhāgya - Brahmā.  18. Variyas —- Kubera.
5. Śobhana — Bṛhaspati. 19. Parigha --Viśvakarman.
6. Atigaṇḍa-Candra.     20. Śiva -- Mitra.
7. Sukarman-Indra.      21. Siddha - Kārtikeya.
8. Dhṛti - Āpah.        22. Sādhya - Sāvitri.
9. Śūla --Sarpa.        23. Śubha - Kamalā.
10. Gaṇḍa - Agni.       24. Śukla-Gauri.
11. Vṛddhi-Sūrya.       25. Brahman - Aśvinau.
12. Dhruva-Pr̥thvi.      26. Aindra – Pitr̥s.
13. Vyāghāta - Pavana.  27. Vaidhr̥ti - Aditi.
14. Harṣaṇa- Rudra.

[^1109]: How neatly huge numbers can be indicated by words may be illustrated by the सि. शि. I. 28 गोद्रीन्द्वद्रिकृताङ्कदस्रनगगोचन्द्राः शकाब्दान्विताः सर्वे सङ्कलिताः पितामहदिने स्युर्वर्तमाने गताः।'. These come to 1972947179 days.

[^1110]: The Daśagitikā verse 3 has been differently interpreted by different scholars. Vide Fleet in JRAS in 1911 pp. 109–128 for Āryabhaṭa's system and pp. 115-125 for explanation of the verse.

## Ever-recurring yogas

These are _nitya_ (ever-recurring) Yogas. The Ratnamālā states that they yield good or bad results in keeping with their names. The Muhūrtadarśana [^1111] states that among these 27 yogas nine are condemned, viz. Parigha, Vyatipāta, Vajra, Vyāghāta, Vaidhṛti, Viṣkambha, Śūla, Gaṇḍa[^1112] and Atigaṇḍa. The Ratnamālā provides that Vyatipāta and Vaidhṛti are wholly inauspicious, the first half of Parigha is so and only the first quarter of those Yogas the names of which are odious; and that one should avoid in all auspicious rites the first three ghaṭikās in Viṣkambha and Vajra, nine ghaṭis in Vyāghāta, five in Sūla, six in Gaṇḍa and Atigaṇḍa. The Agnipurāṇa [^1113] (127. 1-2) has similar verses. The Kālanirṇaya-kārikā [^1114] provides that when a Yoga spreads over two days, fasts and the like are to be observed on the first of the two days provided that Yoga exists at sunset on that day, and vratas and religious gifts are to be performed on the latter (of two days) provided the Yoga exists for three _muhūrtas_(i.e. six ghaṭis) after sunrise and for śrāddha the day on which the Yoga extends over the time required for the śrāddha rite should be accepted.

The system of Yogas must be held to be ancient. The Yājñavalkyasmr̥ti (I. 218) when specifying the times for the performance of śrāddhas includes Vyatīpāta among them. In the Harṣacarita of Bāṇa it is said ( Ucchvāsa IV) that Harṣa was born on a day free from the taint of all defects such as Vyatipāta (vyatīpātādi-sarvadoṣābhiṣaṅga-rahiteshani). There would generally be 13 vyatipātas in a year (sometimes 14) and, among the 96 śrāddhas, śrāddhas on these thirteen vyatipātas are included (vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 382-383 and note 861 ).

Besides these 27 Yogas, there are others that occur when there are special conjunctions of weekdays with certain tithis and nakṣatras or when certain planets occupy certain rāśis on certain tithis and nakṣatras. For Kapilāṣaṣṭhiyoga and Ardhodaya, vide above pp. 279 and 261. Vyatipāta itself has two technical senses apart from being 17th out of the 27 Yogas mentioned above viz. (1) When amāvāsyā [^1115] occurs on a Sunday and the moon is in the first quarter on any one of the nakṣatras Śravaṇa, Aśvini, Dhaniṣṭhā, Ārdrā and Āśleṣā that is Vyatīpāta; (2) When on the 12th of the bright half Jupiter and Mars are in the sign Lion, the Sun is in Ram and when that tithi has Hasta nakṣatra on it, it is Vyatipāta [^1116] Yoga. These two are sometimes called Mahāvyatipāta. Gifts made on those conjunctions are very much commended ;[^1117] 'gifts on amāvāsyā yield one hundred-fold merit, on the suppression of a tithi a thousand-fold, on Viṣuva day ten thousand-fold, but on Vyatīpāta endless (merit). By gifts of cows, land, gold and clothes made on this the donor becomes free from sin and secures godhead, the position of Indra, health, the rulership of men. [^1118] The Sūryasiddhānta (XI. 1-2) gives an explanation of Vyatipāta and Vaidhr̥ta[^1119] (or Vaidhr̥ti) when the sun and the moon are on the same side of either solstice and when the sum of their longitudes being a circle they are of equal declination it is styled Vaidhști. When the moon and the sun are on opposite sides of either solstice and their minutes of declination are the same, it is Vyatīpāta, the sum of their longitudes being a half circle.

II. 341 (without name), कालविवेक 364 (no names). The स्मृतिच, holds that मस्तक means मृगशिरस् , while हेमाद्रि and कालविवेक take it to mean the first quarter and connect it with all the preceding nakṣatras. अग्निपुराण 209. 13 is almost the same as वृद्धमनु.

## Vyatipāta and Vaidhṛti

Why the times mentioned should be looked upon as specially inauspicious or unfortunate is not at all clear and no plausible reason has been assigned. The 27th Yoga called Vaidhṛti was just like Vyatīpāta in all respects. Bharadvāja says that the merit of gifts made on Vyatipāta and Vaidhṛti is endless.

In the pañcaṅgas several Yogas (that have nothing to do with the 27 yogas ) like Amrtasiddhi, Yamaghaṇṭa, Dagdhayoga, Mṛtyuyoga, Ghabāḍa are mentioned; they are purely astrological and all of them except three are passed over here for reasons of space. When on Sunday there is Hasta, on Monday Mṛgaśirṣa, on Tuesday Aśvini, on Wednesday Anurādha, on Thursday Tiṣya (i.e. Puṣya ), on Friday Revati and on Saturday Rohiṇi, all these are Amṛtasiddhiyogas (fortunate ones [^1120] ). Avoid Anurādhā on Sunday, Uttarāṣāḍhā on Monday, Śatatārakā on Tuesday, Aśvini on Wednesday, Mṛgaśīrṣa on Thursday, Āślesā on Friday and Hasta on Saturday-- these are seven Mṛtyuyogas (inauspicious ). If the weekdays from Sunday to Saturday occur on the tithis, 12th, 11th, 10th, 3rd, 6th, 2nd, 7th respectively, these are Dagdhayogas ( inauspicious yogas).

The fifth item in a pañcāṅga is Karaṇa. Half of a tithi is Karaṇa and thus there are two Karaṇas in a tithi and 60 Karaṇas in a lunar month. Karaṇas are of two kinds, viz. _cara_ (moving) and _sthira_ ( immoveable). The seven _cara_ karaṇas with their presiding deities according to Bṛhatsaṁhitā, chap. 99. 1-2 are: 1. Bava-Indra; 2. Bālava-Brahmā; 3 Kaulava-Mitra; 4. Taitila-Aryaman; 5. Gara ( or Garaja )- Earth; 6. Vaṇija Śrī; 7. Viṣṭi-Yama. The four _sthira_ karaṇas with their deities are : 1. Śakuni --Kali; 2. Catuṣpada - Vr̥ṣa; 3. Nāga-snake; 4. Kiṁstughna-Vāyu. Some works transpose the two, Catuṣpada and Nāga. This division of a tithi into two halves resembles the division of a rāśi into two _horās_ (Br̥hajjātaka I. 9). It is likely that one was suggested by the other. The difficulty is to decide which was the earlier. I believe it likely that the division of tithis into two karaṇas is the earlier of the two. The sthira karaṇas occur only once in a month i.e, on the latter half of 14th tithi of dark half occurs Śakuni: Catuṣpada and Nāga occupy the two halves of amāvāsyā and Kiṁstughna occurs on the first half of Pratipad i.e, if the 30 tithis of an amānta month are divided into 60 halves, Śakuni, Catuṣpada and Nāga occupy the 58th, 59th and 60th parts and Kiṁstughna occupies the first half of the pratipad of the next month.

[^1120]:  हस्तो रवौ शशधरे च मृगोत्तमांङ्ग भौमेऽश्विनी बुधदिने च तथानुराधा । तिष्यो गुरौ भृगुसुतेपि च पौष्णधिष्ण्यं रोहिण्यथार्कतनयेऽमृतासद्धियोगाः । रत्नमाला VIII. 8 (ms.): त्यज रविमनुराधा विश्वदेवं च सोमे शतभिषमपि भौमे चन्द्रजे चश्विनी च। शशधरमपि जीवे सर्पदेवं च शुक्रे रविसुतमपि हस्ते मृत्युयोगाश्च सप्त ॥ भुजबलनिवन्ध P. 31 verse 126; आदित्यरुद्रकाष्ठांग्निरसपक्षतुरङ्गमाः। अर्कादिवारयोगेन दह्यन्ते तिथयः क्रमात् ॥ भुजबलनिबन्ध p. 28 verse 114.

Bava occupies the second half of śukla pratipad and the others follow one after another and as they are only seven they are repeated eight times in a month from the 2nd half of pratipad to the first half of the 14th tithi of a dark half, which would be 57th of the sixty halves of the tithis of the month and would be occupied by Viṣṭi. In the pañcāṅgas, two karaṇas should properly be shown under each tithi, but in pañcāṅgas only that Karaṇa is shown against a tithi whose ending moment is 30 ghaṭikās or less from sunrise. The ending times of Karaṇas which are assigned to the 2nd halves of tithis coincide with those of the tithis themselves and therefore there is no need for their calculation. The ending times of the first halves of tithis which correspond to certain Karaṇas are got in the manner described by Pillai in his 'Indian Ephemeris', vol. I. part 1 p. 37, paragraphs 106-107.

The word Karaṇa is derived from the root 'kr̥' (to do ) and is said to have been so named because it divides a tithi in two parts. [^1121] The names of most of the Karaṇas are somewhat strange and inexplicable. The word 'Taitila-kadrū' occurs in Pāṇini VI. 2. 42 (with regard to accent) but the Kāśikā ex plains that Taitila means a descendant or pupil or Titilin'. If a more conjecture were to be offered, the Karaħa Taitila might have been first named after a man so called. The Karañas are only of astrological use and must have been named many centuries before 400 A. D. The Nāradapurāṇa [^1122] mentions both kinds of Karaṇas. The Br̥hat-saṁhitā lays down what should be done or not done on the several Karaṇas [^1123] as follows:

[^1121]: तिथिं द्विधा करोतीति करणमित्यर्थसंज्ञानात् तिथ्यर्धं करणमिति विज्ञायते । com. दीपिका on मु. द. I. 41.

[^1122]: शेषं बवो बालवश्व कौलवस्तैतिलो मरः । वाणेजोभ्रे भवेद्विष्टिः कृष्णभूतापरार्धतः । शकुनिर्नागश्च चतुष्पदं किंस्तुघ्नमेवच ॥ नारदपु० I. 54.126-127.

[^1123]: कुर्याद्ववे शुभचरस्थिरपौष्टिकानि धर्मक्रियाद्विजहितानि च बालवाख्ये। संप्रीति मित्रवरणानि च कौलवे स्युः सौभाग्यसंश्रयगृहाणि च तैतिलाख्ये ॥ कृषिबीजगृहाश्रयजानि गरे वाणिजि ध्रुवकार्यवणिग्युतयः । न हि विष्टिकृतं विदधाति शुभं परघातविषादिषु सिद्धिकरम् ॥ कार्य पौष्टिकमौषधादि शकुनौ मूलानि मन्त्रास्तथा गोकार्याणि चतुष्पदे द्विजपितृनुद्दिश्य राज्यानि च। नागे स्थावरदारुणानि हरणं दौर्भाग्यकर्माण्यतः किंस्तुघ्ने शुभमिष्टिपुष्टिकरणं मङ्गल्यसिद्धिक्रियाः ॥ बृहत्संहिता 99.3-5.

## What should be done on Karaṇas

one should perform on Bava all auspicious ( religious ) rites, all acts that bring about physical health: on Bālava religious acts and acts beneficial to brāhmaṇas; on Kaulava acts leading to good relations and friendship and choosing a bride; on Taitila acts that lead to popularity with people, to securing the patronage ( of some important person ) and building a house : on Gara actions pertaining to ploughing, sowing seeds and those that arise in houses; on Vaṇija, acts of a permanent nature, trading, and meeting with people; whatever is done on Viṣṭi does not bring about fortunate results; but actions as regards destruction of enemies, poisoning and incendiarism become successful on it; on Śakuni one should do what leads to physical health and medication, planting roots and eating them and becoming successful in mantras; on Catuṣpada actions relating to cows (i.e. gifts of them and rearing them ), actions regarding brāhmaṇas and one's ancestors and king's business should be done; on Nāga, acts relating to immoveable property, cruel acts, depriving (a man of his wealth or wife) and acts that lead to hatred among people; on Kiṁstughna, auspicious ( religious ) acts, Vedic sacrifices (called _iṣṭis_ ) and acts leading to physical prosperity and maṅgala acts (marriage &c.) and other acts that bring success in these matters.

One very noticeable feature is that the 7th mobile Karaṇa called Viṣṭi appears to have inspired great terror in the minds of medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra. It will be noticed that dividing the lunar month into 60 halves of tithis, and beginning Bava on the second half of the pratipad of an amānta month, the Karaṇa Viṣṭi will occur eight times in one month as the following diagram of the sixty halves will show:

|         |   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

The fixed Karaṇas will be Śakuni 58,59 Catuṣpada, 60 Nāga, 1 (pratipad first half of next month ) Kiṁstughna.

In the dark half, [^1124] Viṣṭi will occur in the latter half of the third and 10th tithis and in the first half of the 7th and 14th tithis; in the bright half Viṣṭi will occur in the latter half of the 4th and 11th tithis and the first half of the 8th and 15th (i.e. Paurnamāśi) tithis. The Rājamārtaṇḍa [^1125] states 'Some regard Viṣṭi as having the form of a cobra and as terrible; there is danger in the mouth of a snake but not in its tail. The mouth, neck, chest, navel region, waist and tail of Viṣṭi are respectively of five, one, eleven, four, six and three ghaṭikās. Great sages declare that it (Viṣṭi ) does not confer fortunate results, therefore a good man should avoid these except the tail' (on last three ghaṭikās of Viṣṭi auspicious acts may be performed). Viṣṭi is also euphemistically called Bhadrā or Kalyāṇi (it is really _abhadrā_). The terrible nature of Viṣṭi is described in two verses of Bhima-parākrama quoted in Bhujabala-nibandha p. 30 ( vide pp. 95–96 of my paper on ‘Bhoja and his works &c.' in Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, vol. XXIII for 1953-54 ) which also occur in Rājamārtanda, verses 1021-22.

The whole scheme of Karaṇas is itself fanciful. But to draw a lurid picture of one of them, Viṣṭi (which occurs eight times in a month ), and say that it is like a cobra or an ogress is the height of imagination dominated by astrological considerations.

Having described at some length the five aṅgas in a pañcāṅga, a few words must be said about Hindu calendars, though it has been already declared above that purely astronomical matters will not be elaborated in this work.

## Numerous pañcāṅgas in India

In the continent of India there are numerous pañcāṅgas in vogue and there is something like anarchy in this sphere. Hardly any two pañcāṅgas agree completely. Many educated Indians have been demanding that such matters as eclipses, the times of which can be noted by anyone, should be accurately predicted by the almanacs and that our ancient methods of calculating the motions of heavenly bodies should be brought in line with modern accurate calculations based upon observations. This is just what scientific astronomers like Varāhamihira would have done if they were living in modern times. At the end of his two works Varāha makes a very candid but solemn request [^1126] 'whatever in this work comes to be unscientific while it is being used or on account of defects in the mss, or whatever may have been badly executed by me or insufficiently done or not done at all, that should be corrected by learned men, leaving aside all passion (jealousy), and after acquiring (knowledge ) from the lips of well-read men.' Some almanac-makers follow the Nautical Almanac tables as to eclipses and the like and set out other matters according to the old tables. As already stated there are three main schools of astronomers in India, (1) the school that follows the Sūrya-siddhānta (and is called Saurapakṣa ), (2) the second follows the Brahma-siddhānta (and is called Brāhma pakṣa ), (3) the third follows the Āryasiddhānta (and is styled Āryapakṣa ). There are two main points of difference between these, viz. (1) the length of the year, (2) the number of revolutions of the sun, the moon and the planets in a certain period such as a mahāyuga. The difference in the length of the year among the siddhāntas is very small viz. a few _vipalas_ ( a _vipala_ being 1/60th part of a _pala_, which again is 1/60th of a _ghaṭikās_ that is equal to 24 minutes). The length of the year according to the Sūryasiddhanta is 365 days 15 ghaṭis, 31.523 _palas_, while the interval in time between two successive returns of the sun to the vernal equinox (called the tropical year) is only 365 days, 14 ghaṭis and 31.972 _palas_ and the correct sideral ( nākṣatra) year is 365 days, 15 ghaṭis, 22 palas and 53 vipalas (vide C. R. C. Report p. 240 in hours, minutes and seconds and Dikshit's History ed. of 1931 pp. 159, 440). The result is that if one follows the Sūryasiddhānta, the starting point of Hindu astronomers is at present more than 23 degrees to the east of the correct vernal equinox point. This difference is called the _ayanāṁśa_.

[^1126]: ग्रन्थस्य यत्प्रचरतोऽस्य विनाशमेति लेख्याद् बहुश्रुतमुखाधिगमक्रमेण । यद्वा मया कुकृतमल्पमिहाकृतं वा कार्ये तदत्र विदुषा परिहृत्य रागम् ॥ बृहत्संहिता 105. 5, बृहज्जातक 28.8.

As the longitudes of heavenly bodies reckoned from the equinox include these _ayanāṁśas_ they are called _sāyana_ ( _sa + ayana_). The places of heavenly bodies obtained by the methods of the Sūryasiddhanta and medieval Sanskrit works are distinguished by being called _nirayaṇa_ (devoid of taking into account precession). At present according to most almanacs that employ the Sūryasiddhānta values Makarasaṅkrānti (Sun's entrance into Capricorn) falls generally on 14th January, but according to the most accurate modern calculations, it should fall on 21st December; even in calendars that pride themselves on being _śuddha_ the Makarasaṅkrānti falls on 9th January i.e. our Makarasaṅkrānti is celebrated [^1127] about 23 or 18 days later than it should be and the same happens to the vernal equinox, autumnal equinox and the summer solstice and many other observances. Aśvini is still reckoned as the first nakṣatra (in which the vernal equinox is deemed to have occurred about śaka 444 ), although the vernal equinox point has receded to the Uttarā-bhādrapadā group of stars ( which should now be treated as the first nakṣatra). Efforts have been made by those familiar with the modern accurate calculations (such as the late Kero L. Chatre) to introduce modern calculations in our almanacs; but they have met with little response.

## Resolutions passed at Sangli conference

The late Lokamānya Tilak (who was a great Vedic scholar and mathematician) held several conferences of Indian astronomers and other interested people at Bombay (1904), Poona (1917) and at Sangli (1919). At the last conference several resolutions were passed which without making a total break with the past were calculated to reform our calendar and to prevent further deterioration. It is unnecessary to set out all the resolutions, but the most important were that the length of the year should be that of the Sūryasiddhānta but subject to necessary corrections, the rate of precession should be accepted at 50.2 _vikalās_ a year (as determined by modern astronomical observations ), that the Yogatārā [^1128] of Revati (corresponding to Zeta Piscium of modern astronomers) should be deemed to be the beginning of the Zodiacal belt (_rāśicakrārambhasthāna_) and that the _ayanāṁsas_ calculated from the starting point by actual observation should be accepted for the purpose of a new _Karaṇa_ (astronomical manual) to be compiled according to the resolutions.

[^1127]: Vide note 574 above, where the encyclopoedist scholar Hemādri is quoted as saying that the real Makarsaṅkrānti takes place 12 days before the saṅkrānti in the almanacs and that the holy time of Makarsaṅkrānti is really twelve days earlier than the one on which people celebrate it and religious gifts should really be made at that time.

[^1128]: सतारागणमध्ये ( स्वतारा० ? ) तु या तारा दीप्तिमत्तरा । योगतारेति सा प्रोक्ता नक्षत्राणां पुरातनैः ॥ quoted by उत्पल on बृहत्संहिता 24.34 and by अद्भुतसागर P. 44 ( which reads तु श्वेता वा दीप्तिमत्तरा ).

 Unfortunately the resolutions did not state where exactly the star Zeta Piscium was in a particular śaka year. Dr. K. L. Daftari prepared a Karaṇa-grantha called Karaṇakalpalatā in Sanskrit which was published in 1924. Almanacs based on its data have been published and are sometimes known as 'Tilak Pañcāṅga.' But it must be confessed that our people in general are so much custom-ridden that the popular response to the reformed calendar is poor. People still follow the pañcāṅgas based on the old siddhāntas. According to the śāstras every religious festival is to be celebrated at the proper time i.e. in the right season and on the proper tithi. The tithi depends upon the correct calculation of the movements of the moon, which are most difficult to reduce to rules that will give accurate results. Many people will not observe the _ekādaśī_ fast if the eleventh tithi is mixed up with the 10th tithi even for a few ghaṭikās. But what guarantee is there that the 10th tithi has been accurately calculated? The ending moments of tithis do not agree with those given by the Nautical Almanac which are based on modern formula and are verified by actual observation. If tithis be calculated according to different Sanskrit astronomical treatises the moment of a particular tithi may differ by as much as five hours and the same festival (such as Kr̥ṣṇajanmāṣṭami or _Dussera_ ) may be celebrated on two successive days in the same city.

Besides, it must not be forgotten that a pañcāṅga prepared on the basis of the latitude and longitude of Poona or Bombay will be slightly wrong even at a distance of 30 or 40 miles to the west or east or north. It would be a great mistake from the religious point of view to employ a pañcāṅga prepared on the basis of the longitude and latitude of Poona or Bombay in a place several hundred miles away (such as in Hyderabad or Aurangabad). From the religious point of view if accuracy is to be preserved there must be a separate pañcāṅga for every town or every place not more than 10 or 15 miles from places like Bombay or Poona where pañcāṅgas are at present prepared.

In November 1952 the Government of India appointed a committee called the Calendar Reform Committee presided over by Dr. Meghanad Saha to examine all existing calendars being followed at present in India and to submit proposals for an accurate and uniform calendar for the whole of India. That committee submitted a very exhaustive and valuable report in November 1955. The final recommendations of the Committee for a civil calendar and for a religious calendar are set out on pp. 6-8 of the report. They are deserving of the most serious consideration by all who feel that religious observances must be done at the proper time and that now at least in independent India there should not only be one uniform civil calendar, but also one uniform Hindu religious calendar. [^1129] It appears that unless Government makes great efforts for the introduction of a correct calendar even for religious purposes, it would be futile to assume that common people will spontaneously adopt a correct pañcāṅga.

Some of the important recommendations of the Committee may be set out here for the information of readers.

## Recommendations for civil calendar

(1) The Śaka era should be used in the unified national calendar. The Śaka year 1876 corresponds to 1954–55 A. D.
(2) The year should start from the day following the vernal equinox day.
(3) Normal year is to consist of 365 days, while a leap year would have 366 days. After adding 78 to the Śaka era year, if the sum is divisible by 4, then it would be a leap year. But when the sum becomes a multiple of 100, it would be a leap year only when it is divisible by 400; otherwise it would be a common year.
(4) Caitra (or Chaitra as often written) should be the first month of the year and the lengths of the different months should be fixed as follows:
Caitra - 30 days (31 days in a leap year ).
Vaiśākha -31 days.
Jyeṣṭha -31 days.
Āṣāḍha --- 31 days.
Śrāvaṇa--31 days.
Bhādrapada – 31 days.
Āśvina - 30 days.
Kārtika --30 days.
Mārgaśīrṣa - 30 days.
Pauṣa —30 days.
Māgha - 30 days.
Phālguna - 30 days.

[^1129]: Those interested in Indian Calendar Reform should read the Marathi Preface to Dr. K, L, Daftari's work in Sanskrit 'Karaṇa-kalpalatā', Mr. S.M. Karamalkar's Marathi work '_Khareṁ pañcāṅga kasem milel_' (1950), I. H. Q. vol. IV. pp. 483-511 on 'Hindu Calendar' by Sukumar Ranjan Das, Dr. Saha's papers on 'Reform of Indian calendar' in 'Science and Culture' ( Calcutta, 1952), vol. XVII. pp. 57–68 and 109-123 and the Report of the Calendar Reform Committee.

## Calendar Committee's Recommendations

The dates of the reformed Indian calendar would thus have a permanent correspondence with the Gregorian [^1130] calendar. The corresponding dates would be :

Hindu     Gregorian
Caitra 1-March 22 in a common year and 21 in a leap year.
Vaiśākha 1 - April 21.
Jyeṣṭha 1 - May 22.
Āṣāḍha 1—June 22.
Śrāvaṇa 1 -- July 23.
Bhādrapada 1 - August 23.
Āśvina 1 - September 23.
Kārtika 1–October 23.
Mārgaśīrṣa 1 - November 22.
Pauṣa 1 - December 22.
Māgha 1 - January 21.  
Phālguna 1 - February 20.

The Indian seasons would thus be permanently fixed with respect to the reformed Calendar as follows:

_Seasons_ :
Griṣma (summer)--- Vaiśākha and Jýeṣṭha.
Varṣā (rains)-- Āṣāḍha and Śrāvaṇa.
Śarad (Autumn)-- Bhādrapada and  Aśvina.
Hemanta (late autumn)– Kārtika and Mārgaśirṣa.  
Śiśira (winter)– Pauṣa and Māgha.      
Vasanta (Spring )- Phālguna and Caitra.

The States now having the solar calendars for civil and partly religious purposes which start the year from Vaiśākha (April 14th ) will have to begin the year 23 days earlier, but the first month will be Caitra. The effect of this will be that in Bengal, Orissa and Assam solar months start approximately seven days later than now, and in Tamil-nad solar months start approximately 23 days earlier than now, for the month called Vaiśākha (14th April to 14th May) in Bengal and Orissa is called _Chittırai_ (or caitra) in Tamil-nad. Those who use the lunar calendar beginning with Caitra also for civil purposes would experience no great difficulty in adopting this unified calendar as they have at present the beginning of their year on various dates from 15th March to 13th April and the first month is Caitra.

[^1130]: It may be noted that under the Indian Limitation Act (Act I of 1908 ) section 25, all instruments shall, for the purposes of the Limitation Act, be deemed to be made with reference to the Gregorian Calendar. This rule is absolute and therefore even if a bond is made on a tithi of a lunar month in a certain śaka year and is made payable four months after the śaka date, the period of limitation applicable to a suit brought on the bond runs from the expiration of four months after the date computed according to the Gregorian Calendar.

## Recommendations for religious calendar.
(5) The calculation for _Saura_ (solar) months necessary for determining the lunar months of the same name will start 23 degrees and 15 minutes (fixed ayanāṁśa) ahead of the vernal equinox point. This tallies with the present practice of most almanac-makers.

The months would thus commence at the moments when the tropical longitude of the sun attains the following values; viz. Saura Vaiśākha commences when the sun has the longitude of 23° 15', Saura Jyeṣṭha and the other Saura months upto Caitra will commence when the sun has respectively the longitude of 53° 15', 83° 15', 113° 15', 143° 15', 173° 15', 203° 15', 233° 15', 263° 15', 293° 15', 323° 15', 353° 15'.

This recommendation is to be regarded only as a measure of compromise, so that a violent break with the established practice would be avoided. But this compromise would not make our present seasons in the several months as they were in the days of Kālidāsa and Varāhmihira. It is hoped that at not a distant date, further reforms for locating the lunar and solar festivals in the seasons in which they were originally observed will be adopted

(6) As usual the lunar months for religious purposes would commence from the moment of new moon and would be named after the saura month in which the new moon falls. If there be two new moons during the period of a _Saura_ month the lunar month beginning from the first new moon is the _adhika_ or _mala māsa_ and the lunar month beginning from the moment of the second new moon is the _śuddha_ or _nija māsa_ as usual.

(7) The moment of the moon's exit from a nakṣatra division of 13° 20' each or sun's entry into it would be calculated with a variable _ayanāṁśa_ ( i.e. on the supposition that they are fixed with respect to the stars ). The value of this _ayanāṁśa_ would amount to 23° 15' 0" on 21 March 1956. Thereafter it would gradually increases with the annual rate, the mean value of which is about 50.27".

These arrangements would ensure that the religious observances determined by the sun such as the Viṣuva-saṅkrānti, Uttarāyaṇa-saṅkrānti and Dakṣiṇāyana-saṅkrānti would follow astronomically correct seasons, but those determined by the lunar calendar would continue to be observed in times conforming to the present practice and the correction introduced by this report in the length of the year would prevent their further shift in relation to the seasons.

The dates of festivals have already shifted by twenty-three days from the seasons in which they were observed about 1400 years ago as a result of our almanc-makers having ignored the precession of the equinoxes. Although it might appear to some desirable that the entire amount of shifting be wiped out at once, the authors of the Report consider it expedient to maintain this as constant difference and to stop its further increase. As a result there would at present be no deviation from the prevailing custom in the observance of religious festivals.

In the calculation of _nakṣatras_, however, the Report has adopted a variable _ayanāṁśa_, so that at the time of a particular nakṣatra the moon may be seen in the sky in the star or star group of that name. This practice has been followed in our country from Vedic times and is perfectly scientific.

(8) The day should be reckoned from midnight to midnight of the central station ( 82 1/2 degrees E. Longitude and 23° 11' North Latitude ) for civil purposes but for religious purposes the local sunrise system may be followed.

(9) For the purpose of all calculations, the longitudes of the sun and the moon should be obtained by applying the most upto-date and complete equations of their motions, so that they may tally with their actually observed values.

(10) Steps should be taken to compile an 'Indian Ephemeris and Nautical Almanac' by the Government of India, showing in advance the positions of the sun, the moon, the planets and other heavenly bodies. The Indian calendar, both civil and religious, prepared according to the above recommendations should be included in that publication every year.

One can only express the hope that the above mentioned recommendations of the Committee of distinguished astronomers and Sanskrit scholars will receive a wide and hearty response from the Hindu people and that the present confusion and anarchy in the matter of religious observances in our country will come to an end as soon as possible. The Government of India accepted the principal recommendations of the Committee by issuing a Press Note on 23rd October 1956 which decided that the Uniform National Calendar should be adopted with effect from March 22, 1957 corresponding to (Solar) Chaitra 1, 1879, Śaka Era, for certain official purposes in conjunction with the Gregorian Calendar and laid down the steps to be taken by the Central Government and the States Governments for implementing the decision. To avoid misunderstandings and to encourage the use by the mass of the people of this Solar Calendar, Government has decided to make use of both the Gregorian Calendar and the New Indian Solar Calendar together in some Government business, such as publishing the Indian Government Gazette with both dates, the All India Radio Broadcasting news every day announcing both dates at the beginning. But Government is not going to give up as far as possible the practice of declaring public holidays on religious festivals according to the old Calendars. The Government will publish translations of the Calendar Reform Committee's Report in the principal languages of India. It must be said however that this Calendar does not remove all the defects of the Gregorian Calendar.[^1131] The years will still commence on different week days and the number of days in each month still varies. It is feared that this will add only one more calendar to the existing ones.

[^1131]: The Gregorian calendar now in general use in Europe and other parts of the world is irregular, unbalanced and inconvenient (vide pp. 643-44 above. ). For twenty-five years the World Calendar Association founded by Miss. Elisabeth Achelis in New York has been dedicating its time and resources to the introduction of the World Calendar in many lands. The outstanding features of this world calendar are : Every year is the same and begins on Sunday, 1st January and ends on Saturday: each of its four quarters has 91 days, 13 weeks or three months; January, April, July and October have 31 days each and the other months have 30 days each; the Calendar is stabilized and made perpetual by ending the year with a 365th day following 30th December each year. This additional day is named W (it is a World Holiday) and equal to 31st December. In a leap year a day is added at the end of the 2nd quarter, is named W, equals 31 June, called Leap year day and is another World Holiday. The United Nations Organization has not yet lent its support to the World Calendar. An interesting work is 'Time counts: the story of the Calendar' by Harold Watkins (London, 1954.)
