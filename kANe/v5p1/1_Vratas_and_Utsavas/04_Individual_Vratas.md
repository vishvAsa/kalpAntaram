CHAPTER IV

Individual vratas; Caitra Pratipad, Rāmanavami,

Akṣayya-tṛtiya, Paraśurāmajayanti, Daśaharā,

Sāvitri-vrata.

The Mahābhārata[^205] prescribes how to set about a vrata. "Taking in one's hand a copper vessel full of water and turning one's face to the north one should undertake the _upavāsa_, or whatever else he resolves in his mind to undertake as a vrata.' Devala[^206] also says 'without taking food (the previous night), after taking a bath and having performed _ācamana_ (ceremonial sipping of water) and after having declared before the Sun and other _devatās_ (his intent) a person should perform a vrata'. The Varāhapurāṇa[^207] sets out the formula of _saṅkalpa_ ‘after passing the 11th tithi without any food, I shall partake of food the next day, O lotus-eyed one (Viṣṇu), O Acyuta, be thou my refuge'. The saṅkalpa is to be generally made in the case of a fast[^208] or vrata in the morning; the first fifth part of a day comprising three ghaṭikās is called morning.

[^205]: गृहीत्वौदुम्बरं पात्रं वारिपूर्णमुदङ्मुखः । उपवासं तु गृह्णीयाद्यद्वा सङ्कल्पयेद्बुधः । देवतास्तस्य तुष्यन्ति कामिकं तस्य सिध्यति । अन्यथा तु वृथा मर्त्याः क्लिश्यन्ति स्वल्पबुद्धयः । शान्तिपर्व q. by कालविवेक p. 456 and the first verse by कल्पतरु (on व्रत p 4), कु. र. p. 54, व. क्रि. कौ. p. 61. यद्वा... बुधः is variously explained. The कृ. र. states 'तत्र कल्पतरुः। यद्वा अन्यन्नक्तादिकम् । पारिजातस्तु यद्वेत्यनेन सङ्कल्पमात्रमपि कर्तव्यमित्याह ।'. कालविवेक reads 'यदा सङ्कल्पयेधः'. In the अनुशासनपर्व 126.20 the verse is प्रगृह्यौदु: तोयपूर्ण उदङ्मुखः । उप... यद्वा सङ्कल्पयेद् व्रतम् ॥. ति. स. p. 110 quotes from वराहपुराण 'गृहीत्वा... यद्वा वार्येव धारयेत् ॥'.

[^206]: देवलः। अभुक्त्वा प्रातराहारं स्नात्वाचम्य समाहितः । सूर्याय देवताभ्यश्च निवेद्य व्रतमाचरेत् । q. by कल्प० (on व्रत p. 4). स. प्र. (folio 1 b), कृ. र. p. 54.

[^207]: एकादश्यां निराहारो भूत्वा चैव परेऽहनि । भोक्ष्येहं पुण्डरीकाक्ष शरणं मे भवाच्युत । इत्युच्चार्य ततो विद्वान् पुष्पाञ्जलिमथार्पयेत् । वराहपुराण 39. 32q. by कालनिर्णय 268 (from विष्णु), व.क्रि. कौ. pp. 60-61, ति. त. p. 110. vide नारदीय I. 23. 15 for a very similar verse.

[^208]: प्रातरेव सङ्कल्पः कार्यः। तदानीं ज्योतिःशास्त्रप्रतिपदभावेपि स्मृत्युक्तप्रतिपदः सत्त्वात् । नवरात्रमदीप p. 33; अपराह्णव्यापिप्रतिपत्तिथ्यादिषु चिकीर्षितस्यापि व्रतस्व प्रारम्भः प्रातरेव कार्यः। प्रातः सङ्कल्पयेद्विद्वान्नुपवासव्रतादिकम् - इति माधवीयवचनात् । स्मृतिकौ. (on तिथि) p. 12; अतः प्रातःकाले तत्तन्निथ्यलाभे तिय्थ्यन्तरेप्युपासतद्सङ्कल्पः अहोरात्राभोजनरूपस्य तस्य प्रातरारम्भार्हत्वात् । तिथितत्त्व p. 3.

Even when a tithi does not begin in the morning (but begins in the afternoon) the saṅkalpa has to be made in the morning provided a vrata is to be performed on that tithi though it be viddhā. If no saṅkalpa is made the person secures very little benefit from the vrata[^209] and half the merit is lost.

It is now time to turn to individual vratas on the several tithis. First comes the pratipad-vrata.

It will be shown in the next section how in ancient and medieval times the month in which the year began was different at different times and in different countries. We shall begin with the pratipad of the month of Caitra, shall take the month as ending with amāvāsyā (_amānta_) and set out from Caitra the important vratas and festivals in each month and the tithis therein, and the rest will be entered in the list of vratas appended to this section on vratas.

## Caitra pratipad-vrata

In those parts of India (such as the Deccan) where the year begins with Caitra, the first tithi is observed with some pomp and religious ceremony. Most of the medieval digests such as Kalpataru (Naiyatakāla pp. 377–382), Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 360–365), Kr̥tyaratnākara (pp. 103-110), Vratarāja (pp. 49-53) quote from the Brahmapurāṇa the rites of the beginning of the year on the first tithi of Caitra bright half. That Purāṇa[^210] states that Brahmā created the world on the first day of the bright half of Caitra at sunrise, and started the reckoning of time. On that tithi a mahāśānti (propitiatory rite) destroying all untoward occurrences and sins should be offered and first Brahmā should be worshipped with the well-known _upacāras_ and then the other gods with mantras preceded by _om_ and the word _namaḥ_ (_om namo Brahmaṇe tubhyam_), to all divisions of time from the minutest to yugas and to daughters of Dakṣa and lastly to Viṣṇu, then honour brāhmaṇas with food and fees, give presents to relatives and servants, homa should be offered to Agni called Yaviṣṭha, special food should be prepared and a great festival should be celebrated.

[^209]: सङ्कल्पाकरणे फलहानिमाह भविष्यपुराणे । सङ्कल्पेन विना राजन यत्किञ्चित्कुरुते नरः । फलं चाल्पाल्पकं तस्य धर्मस्यार्धऽक्षयो भवेत् ॥ कृत्यतत्त्व p. 424.

[^210]: चैत्रे मासि जगद् ब्रह्मा ससर्ज प्रथमेऽहनि । शुक्लपक्षे समग्रं तु तदा सूर्योदये सति ॥ प्रवर्तयामास तथा कालस्य गणनामपि।... तत्र कार्या महाशान्तिः सर्वकल्मषनाशिनी । सर्वोत्पातप्रशमिनी कलिदुःस्वप्ननाशिनी ॥ &c. कल्पतरु (नैयत p. 377), हे. (व्रत I. p. 360), कृ. र. p. 103.

The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa says that since it was declared by Brahma to be the best among tithis and thus placed in the first place it is called Pratipad. On Caitra pratipad there is worship of the lord of the year, viz. the lord of the week-day[^211] on which pratipad falls, arches and banners should be raised by each householder, one should anoint one's body with oil and have a bath, one should eat leaves of the _nimba_ tree (that are bitter) and should hear from the reciter of the calendar the name of the year (śaka or saṁvat), its lord and the deities that would be the ministers for the year, the governing deities of all corns and fluids &c. Even in these days priests go about in the Deccan to the houses of their patrons and read from the _pañcāṅga_ (almanac) the details about the lord of the year &c. set out above, people raise a pole with silk cloth at top covered with a silver or brass pot, offer worship to the pole with sandalwood paste, flowers &c. and eat _nimba_ leaves. This latter is done even in Saurāṣṭra, though the people employ _saṁvat_ reckoning.

The rule is that the pratipad to be celebrated is that which exists at the time of sunrise. If pratipad exists at sunrise on two days, then the earlier of the two is to be chosen or if there be no pratipad at sunrise on any day then the one which is pūrvaviddhā should be chosen. For example, if there is amāvāsyā for four ghaṭikās after sunrise, then there is pratipad for 56 ghaṭikās and one ghaṭikā more on the next day, then the pratipad though affected by amāvāsyā will have to be chosen for the beginning of the year and not the pratipad intermixed with second tithi the next day. If Caitra be an intercalary month then[^212] the opinion of many writers is that the pratipad of the intercalary month should be held to be the beginning of the year. The Samayamayūkha holds that when Caitra is an intercalary month the year and spring commence with it, but the ceremonial bath with oil and listening to the recital of the saka year should be done in the pure month.  

[^211]: चैत्रशुक्लप्रतिपदि यो वारः स नृपः स्मृतः। नारदीयपुराण I. 56. 1; तिथीनां प्रवरा यस्माद् ब्रह्मणा समुदाहृता । प्रतिपादिता पदे पूर्वे प्रतिपत्तेन कथ्यते ॥ भविष्य, ब्राह्यपर्व 16. 44 q. by हे. (व्रत I. p. 336), व. क्रि. को. p. 28.

[^212]: चैत्रस्य मलमासत्वे तैलाम्ङ्यङ्ग-शकश्रवणादि शुद्ध एव कार्यम् । यद्यपि वत्सरवसन्तयो, प्रवृत्तिर्जाता तथापि तत्प्रयुक्तकृत्यम् - षष्ट्या तु दिवसैर्मासः कथितो बादरायणैः । पूर्वमर्धे परित्यज्य कर्तव्या उत्तरे क्रिया-इति वचनादुत्कृष्योत्तर एव कार्यम् । स. म. p. 13. The पु.चि. p. 57 combats this view. The व.क्रि. को. p. 227 reads पूर्वमर्धे परित्यज्य उत्तरार्धै प्रशस्यते।; the verse षष्ट्या तु. occurs in राजमार्तण्ड and is q. by का.वि. p. 139 as from ज्योतिःशास्त्र.

The[^213] Dharmasindhu makes a difference by saying that the ceremonial bath with oil should be taken on the occasion of the commencement of the new year and repeating the name of the new year should be done on the first day of the intercalary month, but the raising of the pole, eating of nimba leaves, listening to the recital of the almanac should be done in the pure month. In popular belief caitra-śuddhapratipad is one of the 3 1/2 most important muhūrtas (auspicious days) of the year. The Sāmrājya-lakṣmīpiṭhika (pp. 128-133) gives a very elaborate description of the great festival on caitra-śuddha first performed by a king or a chieftain or a zamindar owning several villages.

The next important tithi in Caitra is the 9th in the bright half on which is observed the Rāmanavamīvrata and the celebration of the birth of Rāma, 7th _avatāra_ of Viṣṇu. The principal works on which reliance is placed in Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 941-946), V. K. K. (pp. 523-529), Tithitattva (pp. 59-62), Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 83-86) and other digests are the Agastya-samhitā and Rāmārcanacandrikā of Ānandavanayati, pupil of Mukundavanayati. It is somewhat remarkable that the Kr̥tyakalpataru on vrata does not deal with this. The Rāma cult appears to have become popular later than the Krṣṇa cult. Though the Amarakośa gives Viṣṇu, Nārāyana, Kr̥ṣṇa, Vāsudeva, Devakinandana and Dāmodara as synonyms, it does not mention Rāma (Dāśarathi), but mentions Rāma only as a synonym of Haladhara. Here only a brief treatment of Rāmanavami can be attempted. The Rāmārcanacandrikā and Vratārka (folio 173a) expressly provide that all persons including even cāṇdālas can observe Rāmanavamivrata (they have _adhikāra_).

It is stated in the Agastyasamhitā[^214] that Rāma was born at noon on the 9th of the bright half of Caitra, when Punarvasu asterism was occupied by the Moon and both the Moon and Jupiter were in conjunction and when five planets were in their _ucca_ (exaltation), when the zodiacal sign rising on the eastern horizon was Karkataka (Cancer), and when the Sun was in the sign of Mesa (Aries).

[^213]: चैत्रस्य मलमासत्वे वत्सरारम्भनिमित्तकं तैलाभ्यङ्गसङ्कल्पादौ नूतनवत्सरनामकीर्तनाद्यारम्भं च मलमासप्रतिपद्येव कुर्यात् । प्रतिगृहं ध्वजारोपणं निम्बपत्राशनं वत्सरादिफलश्रवणं नवरात्रारम्भो नवरात्रोत्सवादि निमित्ताभ्यङ्गादिश्च शुद्धमासप्रतिपदि कार्यः। वत्सरारम्भनिमित्तकोप तैलाभ्यङ्गः शुद्धप्रतिपद्येवेति मयूख उक्तम् । धर्मसिन्धु p. 38.

[^214]: चैत्रे नवम्यां प्राक्पक्षे दिवा पुण्ये पुनर्वसौ। उदये गुरुगौरांशोः स्वोच्चस्थे ग्रहपञ्चके। मेषे पूषणि संप्राप्ते लग्ने कर्कटकाह्वये । आविरासीत्स कलया कौशल्यायां परः पुमान् । हे. (on व्रत I. p.941 quoting अगस्त्यसंहिता). These astrological details about the birth of Rāma are in line with those in some editions of the Rāmāyaṇa (except those of Gorresio and some others). Vide my paper on this in the Journal of the Oriental lastitute, Baroda, vol. I. pp. 1-5.

## Rāmanavamivrata

The Kālanirṇaya of Mādhava (pp. 229– 230) lays down the following. When navami is spread over two days, then, if there is navami at noon only on the earlier of the two days, the vrata should be performed on that day. If there is navami at noon on both days, or if there is no navami at noon on any day, then the vrata should be performed on navami mixed with daśamī (and not on navami mixed with aṣṭamī)[^215]. If the 9th tithi is conjoined to Punarvasu asterism that day, that tithi is most holy. Even when there is conjunction of aṣṭami, navami and Punarvasu, still the vrata should be on the next day (i.e. on navami with daśamī). There are further minute rules and differences on this which are passed over here.

It is stated that the Rāmanavamīvrata is _nitya_ (obligatory) for all, while others say that it is obligatory only for devotees of Rāma and kāmya (optional) for those that desire special rewards (such as removal of sin, _mukti_ or release from _saṁsāra_). The Agastya-samhitā[^216] remarks 'This (vrata) is a course prescribed for all and it is the sole means of worldly happiness and _mukti_. Even a person who is impure or very sinful, having performed this best of vratas, is honoured by all and he becomes as if he were Rāma himself. That wretched man who eats food on Rāmanavami suffers torments in the terrible hells called Kumbhīpāka. If a man fasts on a single Rāmanavami all his objects are fulfilled and he is released from all sins'. The Agastyasamhitā further prescribes 'on that day (on which Rāma was born) vrata in the form of a fast should always be performed and on that day the devotee intent on Rāma worship should keep awake at night, sitting on the ground'. The use of the word 'sadā' (always) shows that the vrata is obligatory. Others say that the texts promise such rewards as removal of sin and therefore it is kāmya.  

[^215]: नवमी चाष्टमीविद्धा त्याज्या विष्णुपरायणैः । उपोषणं नवम्यां च दशम्यां चैव पारणम् ॥ अगस्त्यसंहिता q. by व. क्रि. कौ. 525, ति. त. 60. नि. सि. 83. व. का. वि. p.16 (ascribes to आपस्तम्ब ), समयप्रकाश p. 53.

[^216]: सर्वेषामप्ययं धर्मों मुक्तिमुक्त्येकसाधनम् । अशुचिर्वापि पापिष्ठः कृत्वेदं व्रतमुत्तमम् । पूज्यः स्यात् सर्वभूतानां यथा रामस्तथैव सः। यस्तु रामनवम्यां तु भुङ्क्ते स च नराधमः । कुम्भीपाकेषु घोरेषु पच्यते नात्र संशयः । ... एकामपि नरो भक्त्या श्रीरामनवमी मुने । उपोष्य कृतकृत्यः स्वात्सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते । अगस्त्यसंहिता q. by हे. (व्रत vol. I. 992), नि. सि. p. 84; तस्मिन् दिने तु कर्तव्यमुपवासव्रतं सदा । तत्र जागरणं कुर्याद्रघुनाथवरे सुचि ॥ अगस्त्यसंहिता q. by हे. (व्रत I. p. 941), स्मृतिमु. (on काल p. 836).

The conclusion of many works (like the Nirṇayasindhu and the Tithitattva) is that this vrata is both _kāmya_ and _nitya_ according to the Mimāṁsā maxim of 'samyogaprthaktva'[^217] (Jai. IV. 3.5-7). In the section on 'Agnihotra' the Veda says 'he makes an offering of curds in the fire'; there is another sentence in the same, viz. 'one who desires bodily vigour should make an offering of curds in the fire'. The meaning is that curds being separately mentioned in two different sentences which are both independent, homa with _dadhi_ is both _nitya_ and _kāmya_.

The procedure of Rāmanavamivrata as set out in H. V. I. pp. 941-946. N. S. pp. 83–86, T. T. pp. 59-62, K. T. V. pp, 96-98, Vratarāja pp. 319-329, Vratārka (folios 172–182 ), may be briefly described as follows:- The devotee should take a bath on the 8th tithi in the bright half of Caitra, perform his _sandhyā_ prayer and should invite a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda and śāstras and devoted to Rāma worship and knowing the procedure of Rāma mantras, should honour him and make a request 'I shall make a gift of the image of Rāma'. Then he should give oil to the brāhmaṇa for anointing his body, make him bathe, make him wear white garments and flowers, should offer him a dinner containing _sāttvika_ food and should himself partake of the same food and constantly think of Rāma. On that day he and the _ācārya_ honoured by him should go without food at night, should listen to the stories of Rāma the whole day and should himself sleep and make the ācārya sleep on the ground (not on a cot). The next morning he should get up, bathe, perform his _sandhyā_, should construct a brilliant maṇḍapa with four doors and decked with arches, banners and flowers. The eastern door should be decked with conch, wheel and (an image of) Garuḍa, bow and arrows, the western one with mace, sword and armlets and the north with lotuses, _svastika_ signs and blue stones and prepare a raised altar four cubits (in the maṇḍapa) and should provide holy songs, music and dance therein. He should have benedictions from brāhmaṇas.  

[^217]: एकस्य तूभयत्वे संयोगपृथक्त्वम् । शेष इति चेत् । नार्थपृथक्त्वात् । जै. IV. 3. 5-7; 'अग्निहोत्रे श्रूयते दघ्ना जुहोतीति । पुनश्च दघ्नेन्द्रियकामस्य जुहुयादिति । ... तस्माद्यदेव नैमित्तिकं तदेव नित्यार्थमिति ।। शबर; तस्मात्पृथकूसंयोगादुभयार्थे दधि स्यात् । शास्त्रदीपिका: एकोस्योभयार्थत्वे संयोगस्य संयुज्यते तादर्थ्येन बोध्यतेऽनेनेति व्युत्परया वाक्यस्य पृथक्त्वं नानात्वं कारणं तदिहाप्यस्तीति दधिखादिरादिकमुभयार्थम् । मयूखमालिका on शास्त्रदीपिका. Another example of the application of the संयोगपृथकृत्वन्याय is Agnihotra. We have two Vedic passages 'अग्निहोत्रं जुहुयात् स्वर्गकामः' and 'यावज्जीवमग्निहोत्रं जुहोति'.

## Procedure of Rāmanavamivrata

Then he should make a saṅkalpa 'On the Rāmanavami I shall observe a fast for the whole day and being intent on worshipping Rāma shall make a golden image of Rāma and shall donate it for pleasing Rāma' and then say 'may Rāma remove my numerous heavy sins'. The image of Rāma should be placed on a pedestal, have two hands and Jānaki should be seated on the left thigh of (Rāma) image, which should be bathed with _pañcāmr̥ta_[^218], then _mūlamantra_[^219] should be recited and the usual _nyāsas_ should be made. The festival or pūjā is performed in the noon. Then at night he should keep awake and listen to the divine stories about Rāma and be surrounded by devotees of Rāma, should sing hymns about Rāma. Then the next morning he should bathe, perform sandhyā, should worship the image of Rāma with sixteen upacāras employing the 16 verses of Rg. X. 90 and with Paurāṇika verses, also perform the worship of the several limbs of the image (Śri-Rāmabhadrāya namaḥ pādau pūjayāmi and so on), offer homa on the altar or in a _kuṇda_ with the _mūlamantra_ and then in the ordinary fire offer 108 oblations of clarified butter or _pāyasa_ (rice cooked in milk with sugar), then he should honour the ācārya with gifts of ear-rings, finger rings, flowers, clothes &c. and should recite the following mantra 'O Rāma! I shall today donate this golden image of yours decked with ornaments and clothes for securing your favour; may Rāma favour me'. He should give dakṣiṇā (fee) to the ācārya and to other brāhmaṇas gold, cow, a pair of clothes, corn, according to his ability and then have dinner along with the brāhmaṇas. By doing so he becomes free from even mortal sins like brāhmaṇa-murder. There is no need to say more. The man who performs this vrata has _mukti_ in his hand (as it were) and he acquires the same merit that one secures by the dāna called Tulāpuruṣa[^220] in Kurukṣetra on a solar eclipse.

[^218]: Images of gods are bathed with पञ्चामृत i.e. milk, curds, clarified butter, honey and sugar.

[^219]: Nyāsa is mystical sanctification of the several limbs of the body with Vedic mantras (such as the 16 verses of R̥gveda X. 90 ) or other mantras. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II, pp. 319-320, 739 and 900. The Mūlamantra is either of six letters, viz. श्रीरामरामरामेति or of thirteen letters, viz. श्रीरामजयरामजयजयरामेति. In these days the priest sometimes repeats R̥g. x 3.3 as the Vedic mūlamantra 'भद्रो भद्रया सचमान आगात् स्वसारंजारो अभ्येति पश्चात् । सुप्रकेतैर्द्युभिरग्निर्वितिष्ठन् रुशद्भिर्वर्णैरभि राममस्थात्'॥. Here the word राम occurs, though in a different sense. सायण explains 'रामं कृष्णं शार्वरं तमः'.

[^220]: For the Mahādāna called Talāpuruṣa, vide H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 870.

Hemādri is comparatively brief, but the Tithitattva (pp. 61-62), Nirṇayasindhu (p. 85), Vratārka add further details from Agastyasaṁhitā. They say that images of Bharata and Śatrughna (by the side of Rāma image) and of Lakṣmaṇa with a bow in his hand and of Daśaratha (to the right) and of Kausalyā should also be made and worshipped with appropriate Paurānika mantras (the one for Kausalyā is quoted in the note )[^221]. The Rāmārcanacandrikā adds further details about the worship of ten and five _āvaraṇas_ to which even tho Nirṇayasindhu refers by name alone.

Rāmanavami is not to be celebrated in the intercalary Caitra month (malamāsa). The same rule applies to Janmāṣṭami and other vratas.

In modern times not many people observe a fast on Rāmanavami and hardly one performs homa or donates images, but the birth of Rāma is celebrated in Rāma temples by many at noon with great ceremony. A. Haridāsa treats a gathering of men and women assembled in the temple to a _kirtan_ with music and bhajan on the birth of Rāma. At the end there is distribution of sweets or 'Suṇṭhavaḍā' (dried ginger with sugar or jaggery) in the Deccan. In some places such as Nasik, Tirupati, Ayodhyā and Rāmeśvara this festival is performed with great pomp and thousands of people attend at these holy places. There is no holy name other than that of Rāma so constantly on Hindu lips even in these days.

## Akṣayyatr̥tiyā

The important tithi in Vaiśākha is the third of the bright half. It is called Akṣayya-tr̥tiya. The earliest reference to it is probably in the Viṣṇu-dharmasūtra where it is said that one should fast on this tithi, worship Vāsudeva with whole grains of rice, should offer them into fire and donate them; thereby one becomes purified from all sins; whatever a man donates on that day becomes inexhaustible. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 65, verses 1-7), Nāradīya I. 112. 10 ff treat of this. The former states that whatever is donated or sacrificed or muttered on this tithi becomes inexhaustible (in reward), that a fast thereon yields inexhaustible results, that if this tr̥tiyā has Kr̥ttikā asterism then it is specially commended.  

[^221]: कौसल्यामन्त्रस्तु । रामस्य जननी चासि रामरूपमिदं जगत् । अतस्त्वां पूजयिष्यामि लोकमातर्नमोस्तु ते॥ नमो दशरथायेति पूजयेत्पितरं ततः । अत्र दशावरणपश्चावरणादिपूजा अन्यत्र ज्ञेया । नि.सि. p. 85, ति.त. p. 61, कृ.त. 464 ( has कौसल्यामन्त्र).

The Bhaviṣyottara-purāṇa[^222] (chap. 30. 1-19) deals at some length with it. It says: 'this tithi is one of the Yugādi tithis because the Kr̥ta age began on it; whatever is done on it, such as bath, gifts, muttering of sacred texts (_japa_), offerings into fire, Veda study, satiating deceased ancestors (with water all that becomes inexhaustible'. It provides that gifts of jars of water and of umbrellas and of footwear should be made (to brāhmaṇas) on this day and that what is sacrificed or donated on this day never comes to an end and therefore this tithi is called akṣaya (inexhaustible) by the sāges. V. Dh. also refers to it[^223].The Lar plates of Govindacandra of Kanauj recite that the king after bathing in the Ganges on the occasion of the Akṣayya-tṛtiyā festival on Monday in _saṁvat_ 1202 (i.e. 15th April 1146 A. D.) made the grant of a village to one Śridhara Thakkura (E. I. vol. VII p. 98). The third is to be taken for these religious rites when it exists in the forenoon; but if it exists in the forenoon on two days the one that exists on the later day should be chosen for vrata. Vide Hemādri on Kāla p. 618 and on vrata vol. I, pp. 500-502, Vratarāja pp. 93–96, Sm. K. p. 109 for further details. It is provided in the Purāṇas that śrāddha performed on the tithis called _Yugādi_ gives inexhaustible gratification to the pitṛs. But no piṇḍas (rice-balls ) are to be offered in Yugādi-śrāddha. Akṣayyatr̥tiyā is one of the 3 days popularly believed to be most auspicious in the year ( it is itself 1/2).

[^222]: स्नानं दानं जपो होमः स्वाध्यायः पितृतर्पणम्। यदस्यां क्रियते किंचित् सर्वे स्यात्तदिहाक्षयम् । आदौ कृतयुगस्येयं युगादिस्तेन कथ्यते। अस्यां तिथौ क्षयमुपैति हुतं न दत्तं तेनाक्षया च मुनिभिः कथिता तृतीया। भाविष्योत्तर 30. 2-3 and 19. Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 374 and note 841 for Yugadi-tithis and कृ.र pp. 541-542 for divergence of views about Yugādis in the Purāṇas. A late work, the पुरुषार्थचिन्तामणि , resolves the contradiction as follows: अत्र कस्मिंश्चित्कल्पे माघस्य पौर्णमास्यां कलियुगप्रवृत्तिः कस्मिंश्चिदमावास्यायामिति कल्पभेदेन व्यवस्था। (p. 87). The निर्णयामृत p. 36 gives the same explanation.

## Paraśurāmajayanti

On the third of Vaiśākha bright half is celebrated 'Paraśurāmajayanti'[^224]. It is to be celebrated in the first _prahara_ (watch) of the night ('sūryāstottaram trimuhūrtaḥ pradosaḥ' Dharmasindhu p. 9). It is stated in the Skanda 225 and Bhaviṣya purāṇas that Viṣṇu was born from Renuki on the third of the bright half of Vaiśākha when the naksatra was Punarvasu and in the first watch of the night and when six planets were ucca (in exaltation) and Rāhu was in the zodiacal sign Mithuna (Gemini). The image of Paražurāma is to be worshipped and arghya is to be offered to it with the mantra quoted below.226 If the third tithi is suddhā (i. e. not mixed with another tithi) the vrata (i. e. fast) is to be performed that day; but if on two days there is third tithi in the evening first watch even partially, then the later one is to be the day of the fast; otherwise (if the third is viddhi, but does not extend up to the first watch of the night) the fast should be observed on the first of the two days. There are some temples erected in honour of Parasurama, particularly in the Konkana such as the one near Chiplun in which Paraśurāma jayanti is celebrated with great ceremony. Vide N. S. p. 95, Sm. K. p. 112, P. C. 89 for further details. H. V. I. p. 117 gives directions as to the image or painting of Paraśurāma. But Paraśurāma-jayanti is not observed in several parts of India (such as Saurāṣtra), though observed in South India. 

In the month of Jyestha there is a vrata called Daśaharā on the 10th tithi of the bright half. The Brahmapurāṇa (63. 15) states that the 10th of Jyestha bright half is called Daśaharā, because it destroys ten sins 227. Ten sins (divided into three

classes, of the body, of speech and of the mind) are enumerated in Manu XII. 5–7.228 The Rājamārtaṇḍa (verses 1397–1405) speaks of this vrata. The N. S. (p. 98) and some other digests put forward another basis, viz. 229 Jyestha śu. 10 on Tuesday (acc. to Varāha) or Wednesday (acc. to Skanda), on Hasta naksatra, Vyatīpāta, Gara ( karana), Ananda-yoga, the moon and sun being in Virgo and Taurus respectively--when all these concur or when most of them concur, a person should bathe in the Ganges and then become free from all sins. Wednesday and Hasta constitute Anandayoga. It was supposed that the Ganges came to the earth on this tithi, on Tuesday and on Hasta asterism and therefore originally it appears to have been a vrata of a bath in the Ganges at Daśāśvamedha, of worship and gifts. Then it was extended to a bath in any big river and offering of arghya, sesame and water. Vide Kāśikhanda, Tristhali-setu, K.T: 431, Vratarāja pp. 352-355, P. C. pp. 144-145 for further details. At present in towns and villages on the big rivers such as Krṣṇā, Godāvari, Narmadā and the Ganges, a festival of the Ganges is celebrated. At such places as Banaras, Prayāga, Haridyāra, Nasik the utsava is celebrated on a large scale. If there be an intercalary Jyestha, this vrata was to be performed in that month.

On the Full moon day of Jyestha women whose husbands are living perform even now in many parts of India the Sāvitri vrata or Vatasāvitrivrata. The story of Savitri whose memory has been cherished for ages by all Indian women as an ideal of a pativratā, of wifely devotion to the husband unto death (and even thereafter) is very popular and is described at great length in the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva chap. 293-299) and in the Purāṇas (such as in Matsya, chap. 208–214, Skandapurāṇa, Prabhāsakhanda chap. 166, Vispudharmottara, II chap. 36-41).

is narrated230 that she married Satyavat whose death at the end of one year was predicted by the sage Nārada and that three days before the time indicated by Nārada she undertook a fast, accompanied her husband into the forest where he had gone to collect firewood, flowers and fruits as his blind father had lost his kingdom and that she had an argument with Yama the God of Death, who became so pleased with her that he gave her several boons and ultimately ber husband that had died as predicted was restored to life. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa account of the story of Sāvitri is cited at great length in Kr̥tyaratnākara (pp. 264-278). Hemādri (on vrata II pp. 258–272) sets out a vrata called Brahma-Sāyitrīvrata from Bhayisyottara which contains the story of Sāvitri as in the Mahābhārata and Matsya and also (vol. II pp. 272-279) a Vatasāvitrīvrata from Skanda. But the first was performed for three days from the 13th tithi to Full Moon in Bhādrapada month and not in Jyestha, while the 2nd was to be performed on Jyestha Full Moon by a woman whose husband was living or even by a sonless widow. This last is called Mahā savitrivrata by the Vratakālaviveka (p. 20 of I. H. Q. vol. 17 No. 4 supplement).

The Nirṇayasindhu refers to the vrata in Bhadrapada mentioned by Hemādri and remarks 231 that it was not in vogue in its day. The Vrataprakāśa describes (folios 169–170) the Brahmasāvitrīvrata.

But the Vatasāvitrivrata that is now in vogue must also have been performed long before the 10th century A. D. The Agnipurana (194. 5-8) briefly describes 232 a vrata that in

Vatasāvitrivrata

essentials is the same as the modern Vatasāvitrīvrata. The Rājamārtaṇḍa says 'on the 14th 233 of the bright half of Jyestha women full of faith perform the Sāvitrivrata for being free from widowhood'. This is followed by people in the Deccan. The Nirṇayāmṛta following the Bhaviṣya held that this vrata was to be performed on Amāvāsyā, while the Kr̥tyatattva (p. 430 ), and T. T. p. 121 say that Sāvitrīvrata is to be observed on dark 14th after the Full Moon of Jyestha.

If the Paurnimā is spread over two days, then the vrata is to be performed on Caturdaśī (14th tithi) mixed up with Paurnimā. The three days for which the vrata is to last may have to be begun on the 12th or 13th. But if caturdaśī is of the extent of 18 ghaṭikās and then Paurṇimā supervenes, then caturdaśī is to be given up (K. N. p. 301).

The worship of the Vaṭa tree comes in probably because Satyavat when the moment of death approached took shelter under the shade of the Vata tree and supported himself by & branch of it and spoke in a choked voice to Savitri that he had pain in the head. 234 The procedure of this vrata as set out in the Vratarka (folios 312–320) and other late medieval works is briefly as follows:-The woman should make a saṅkalpa in the form 'I shall perform Sāvitrivrata for securing long life and health to my husband and my sons and for securing freedom from widowhood in this and subsequent lives'. She should then sprinkle water at the root of the Vata tree and surround it with cotton threads and should perform its worship with the upacāras and then offer worship to Savitri (with image or mentally) from her feet upwards and pray to her to bestow on her beauty, good name, prosperity, and freedom from widowhood. Then she should worship Yama and Nārada and give presents (rūyana) to the priest and break her fast next day. In Bengal the mode of performing Savitri-vrata is different from the above. In Bengal there is no Vatasāvitrivrata, but there is Sāvitricaturdasi on the 14th of the dark half of Jyestha to secure blessed wifehood in later lives. It is continued for 14 years.

(Sec. I, CH. IV

If a woman was unable to fast for three days, she was allowed to have nakta on the 13th, to eat on the 14th whatever came to her without her asking for it and fast on the 15th.235

In JAOS. vol. 21 part 2 pp. 53-66 Allen has compared the Sāvitrīvrata as described in the Mahābhārata and the purāṇas and in Hemādri and Vratārka.

I have not generally tried to speculate about the remote origins, if any, of even the most important vratas. But some scholars endowed with a lively imagination and imbued with the theories underlying Frazer's 'Golden Bough' have tried their hands at the origins of some vratas. The late Mr. B. A. Gupte endeavoured to explain the symbolism of the Sāvitrīvrata' in I. A. vol. 35 (for 1906) pp. 116–119. He bases his article on the forty figures that his wife drew with sandalwood paste in celebrating the Sāvitri-vrata. He holds that the story of Savitri is based on a Nature Myth and that the first impression produced on him by the pictures drawn by his wife is that it is a marriage scene. What mainly vitiates all his imaginative explanations is that the Savitrī-vrata is not mentioned anywhere in any work that can be said to be even two thousand years old and that he thinks his wife's figures or pictures represent the general way of celebrating that vrata in the whole of India throughout the centuries. The Sāvitrīvrata is observed throughout India, but I have not been able to find that women all over India depict the scene as was done by Mr. Gupte's wife (who probably was a well educated lady and had an artistic training in some big city and turned her skill to lend charm and picturesqueness to that vrata, by adding her own artistic ideas to those of millions of unedu cated simple women in small towns and villages ).
