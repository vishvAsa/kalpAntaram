CHAPTER XII

Holikā and Grahaṇa (eclipse)

## Holi or Holikā

_Holikā_. Holi or Holikā is a festival of unmixed gaiety and frolics throughout India, though all parts do not observe it in the same way. One element, viz. bonfire, is present almost everywhere except in Bengal. Swinging of Kṛṣṇa image on Phālguna Full Moon is done in Bengal, but it is not observed in several other parts of India. The number of days during which this festival is observed also varies from province to province. Another item which is common to many parts of India is the sprinkling of friends with coloured water from bamboo or metal syringes or with red powder and this merriment is indulged in even now by persons in high places. In the Konkan men dressed as women accompanied by several persons go about with songs (often obscene) and music and dance. The only religious element is the worship of Kṛṣṇa in Bengal and in some provinces where bonfires are made a priest is engaged to perform pūjā before the bonfire, people go round the fire throwing cocoanuts in the burning wood and grass, taking them out half-burnt and distributing the singed kernel among the people present as _prasāda_. In some parts people produce sounds by beating their mouths with the backs of their hands. It is not possible nor necessary to set out in this notice all the varying details of this festival throughout the whole of India.

This festival is very ancient. Originally the form of the word was Holākā and from references in the bhāṣya of Śabara on the Pūrvamīmāmsā-sūtra (1. 3. 15-23 ) [^610] it appears that it was in ancient times & usage very prevalent in the eastern parts of Bhārata.

[^610]: अनुमानव्यवस्थानात्तत्संयुक्तं प्रमाणं स्यात् । अपि वा सर्वधर्मः स्यात्तन्न्यायत्वाद्विधानस्य । जै. I. 3.15-16; on these शबर puts forth the pūrvapakșa and reply as follows: तस्माद् होलाकादयः प्राच्यैरेव कर्तव्याः आह्रीनैबुकादयो दाक्षिणात्यैरेव उद्वदृषभेयज्ञादय उदीच्यैरेव ।...अपि वेति पक्षग्यावृत्तिः। एवं जातीयकः सर्वधर्मः स्यात्।. vide H. of Dh. vol. III, Pp. 851-853 and note 1648. The जैमिनीयन्यायमालाविस्तर on this explains 'वसन्तोत्सवो होलाका. ' This topic is called होलाकाधिकरण because the first example in Śabara's bhāṣya refers to the practice of Holākā.

## Holikā on Phālguna Full Moon

But Jaimini and Śabara appear to hold that Holākā should be observed by all Āryas. In the Kāṭhakagṛhya 73.1 there [^611] is the _sūtra_ 'Rākā Holāke' which is explained by the commentator Devapāla as follows ‘Holā is a special rite performed for the _saubhāgya_ of women and in that rite Rākā ( Full Moon ) is the deity'. Other commentators interpret it differently. Among the twenty _krīḍas_ found in the whole of Bhārata and also restricted to certain provinces only and mentioned by Vātsyāyana in his Kāmasūtra [^612] ( 1. 4. 42 ) is Holākā which is explained by the commentary Jayamangalā as comprising the sprinkling of each other by people on Phālguna Full Moon with coloured water discharged from a horn or the like and throwing perfumed powder. Hemādri on Kāla (p. 106 ) quotes a verse from Bṛhadyama [^613] in which Holikā-pūrṇimā is called 'Hutāśanī' (as in modern times ). Hemādri further quotes a verse from Lingapurāṇa [^614] "the Phālguna Full-moon day is said to be known as 'Phālgunikā', as full of boyish pranks and tending to the prosperity of people" and another verse from Varāhapurāṇa where it is qualified as 'patavāsavilāsini' (i.e, containing pranks with powder). Hemādri ( on vrata, II. 184–190 ) quotes a long passage from the Bhav. U. (chap. 132. 1-51 ) in which Yudhiṣṭhira is represented as asking Kṛṣṇa why in each village and town a festival is held on Phā. Full moon, why boys become boisterous in each house and kindle Holākā, what god is worshipped therein, who introduced the festival and what is done therein and why it is called 'Aḍāḍā.' Kṛṣṇa tells him a legend about king Raghu whom the citizens approached with the complaint that a certain rākṣasi (ogress) called Ḍhoṇḍhā troubled boys by day and night.

The king consulted his _purohita_ who told him that she was a rākṣasi, daughter of Mālin, who got from Śiva a boon that she would not be liable to be killed by gods or men nor suffer from arms nor from cold, heat or rain. The priest further told the king that Śiva said that she would be in danger from boys going about crazily. The priest added that on Phālguna 15th season of cold vanishes and summer starts, that people may laugh and enjoy themselves, that boys with bits of wood in their hands may go out of houses in great glee, collect a heap of wood and grass, set it on fire with Rākṣoghna mantras, clap their hands, go round the fire thrice, laugh, sing and utter obscene words in the popular language and by that noise and loud peals of laughter on the part of boys and by the homa [^615] the ogress would die. When the king got all this done, the rākṣasi expired and the day came to be called 'Aḍāḍā' and Holikā. Then it is further stated that on the next day which is the first tithi of the month of Caitra (on the pūrṇimānta reckoning) people should salute the ashes of the bonfire with the mantra quoted below,[^616] then worship of Kāma should be made on a square in the house yard in the midst of which square a seat should be arranged and in front a jar covered with leaves containing akṣatas and smeared with white sandalwood paste should be placed. The image of Kāma should have sandalwood paste applied to it by a beautiful woman and thereafter the priest should make the performer partake of mango blossoms mixed with sandalwood paste. Then donations should be made to learned brāhmaṇas, bards &c. according to one's ability with the words. May the God of Love be pleased with me.' The purāṇa winds up with the verse 'When the season of frost ends on the 15th of the bright half and the time of spring approaches in the morning, that man who partakes of mango blossoms with sandalwood paste lives in happiness.'

[^615]: सर्वदुष्टदमो होमः सर्वरोगोपशान्तिदः । क्रियतेऽस्यां द्विजैः पार्थ तेन सा होलिका मता ॥ भविष्योत्तर 132.31 q. by हे. on व्रत at p. 187. This derives होलिका from होम.

[^616]: वन्दितासि सुरेन्द्रेण ब्रह्मणा शङ्करेण च। अतस्त्वं पाहि नो देवि विभूते भूतिदा भव ॥ हे. on व्रत p. 188, पु. चि. p. 81.

Instead of the gay and saturnalia-like practices prevalent in many parts of India about Holikā, Bengal celebrates it by the Dolayātrā. Śūlapāṇi composed thereon a short work called Dolayātrā-viveka.[^617] The festival should be carried on for five or three days. Before the Full moon of Phālguna, on the 14th at the beginning of night an utsava in honour of Agni is to be celebrated to the east of the _maṇḍapa_. Then an image of Govinda is to be made, it is established in a structure with 16 pillars on a _vedikā_ (raised platform) and it is to be bathed with pañcāmṛta and various items of worship are to be offered and seven times the swing on which the image is placed has to be rocked to and fro. Fire kindled on the first day is to be preserved till the days of the festival end. At the end the swing is to be rocked 21 times. It is narrated that king Indradyumna started this swing festival in Vṛndāvana. By means of this utsava a man becomes free from all sins. Then Śūlapāṇi discusses at some length the exact tithi, _prahara_ and nakṣatra on which the Dolayātrā is to be performed. Briefly, the conclusion is that Dolayātrā must be performed when the Full Moon tithi is running, whether there is Uttarā-phalguni-nakṣatra or not.[^618]

The Kālatattvavivecana very succinctly puts down the characteristics of Holikotsava as set forth in the Bhaviṣyottara.[^619] The Nirṇayasindhu (227), Smr̥ti-kaustubha (516-519), Puruṣārtha-cintāmaṇi (308-319) and other late medieval works discourse on this festival, but for reasons of space their discussions are not set out here.

## Holikā

As Holākā is mentioned by Jaimini and the Kāthakagṛhya, it follows that it prevailed at least some centuries before Christ. The Kāmasūtra and Bhaviṣyottara connect it with spring and it was performed at the end of the year (on pūrṇimānta reckoning). Therefore, the bonfire represents the expiry of the season of frost and cold and heralds the warmth and love-making of spring. The ribald songs, dance and music are further accretions due to the joy felt on the advent of spring. The sprinkling of coloured water and powder is an additional item in the celebration of the delights of spring. In some provinces this sprinkling is done on the very day of the Holikā, while in the Deccan it is indulged in on the 5th day (popularly called Raṅga-pañcami) after Holikā bonfire. Though the Holikā festival is composite in several parts of India and is celebrated on more days than one, in origin it is no more than a spring festival. In some parts mud is [^620] thrown by people at each other on the day after bonfire. That is probably an extension of the idea of applying ashes of the bonfire to one's forehead and the body on the day after it. The usage in some parts of creating noise by striking the back of one's hand against one's mouth accompanied by an obscene reference to sex is a further perversion due to welcoming the advent of spring which is traditionally the season of love-making. Mr. Gupte in 'Hindu holidays and ceremonies' tries hard to show that the Holikā festival was 'imported from Egypt or Greece' (p. 92). This theory is very fantastic and does not deserve to be taken seriously. He had not read, it appears, the ancient works mentioned above and is not himself sure whether the origin is to be found in Egypt or in Greece.

## Grahaṇa (eclipse, solar and lunar)

_Grahaṇa_ (eclipse, solar and lunar). Great importance was attached from very ancient times to eclipses. An extensive literature has accumulated on this subject. Vide among others Hemādri on Kāla 379-394, Kālaviveka 521-543, Kr̥tyaratnākara 625-631, Kālanirṇaya 346-358, Varṣakriyākaumudi 90–117, Tithitattva 150-162, Kṛtyatattva 432-434, Nirṇayasindhu 61-76, SmK 69-80, Dharmasindhu 32-35, Gadādharapaddhati (Kālasāra) 588-599. A total eclipse of the Sun is referred to even in the Ṛgveda V. 40.5, 6, 8 'O Sun! when Svarbhānu, the son of an asura, struck you with darkness. O Indra! when you struck down the wiles of Svarbhānu that existed below the heaven, Atri secured the Sun which had been concealed by darkness that deviated from the usual rule (or law) by means of the highest (or 4th) prayer' &c.[^621]

[^620]: वर्षकृत्यदीपक on p. 301 quotes the following verses 'प्रभाते विमले जाते ह्यङ्गे भस्मं च कारयेत् । सर्वाङ्गे च ललाटे च क्रीडितव्यं पिशाचवत् । सिन्दुरैः कुङ्कुमैश्चैव धूलिभिर्धूसरो भवेत् । गीतं वाद्यं च नृत्यं च कुर्याद्रथ्योपसर्पणम् । बाह्मणैः क्षत्रियैवैश्यैः शूदैश्वान्यैश्य जातिभिः । एकीभूय प्रकर्तव्या क्रीडा या फाल्गुने सदा । बालकैः सह गन्तव्यं फाल्गुन्यां च युधिष्ठिर'॥

[^621]: यत्त्वा सूर्य स्वर्भानुस्तमसाविध्यदासुरः । ... स्वर्भानोरध यदिन्द्र माया अवो दिवो वर्तमाना अवाहन् । गूह्लं सूर्ये तमसापव्रतेन तुरीयेण ब्रह्मणाविन्ददात्रिः। ग्राव्णो ब्रह्मा युयुजानः सपर्यन् कीरिणा देवान्नमसोपशिक्षन् । अत्रिः सूर्यस्य दिवि चक्षुराधात् स्वर्भानारेप माया अघुक्षत् ॥ ऋ. V. 40.5,6,8. It is difficult to say what the words तुरीयेण ब्रह्मणा exactly mean, the 4th verse (तुरीयं ब्रह्म ) from the 5th appears to say that Atri prepared to extract Soma, offered worship with a hymn of praise and prostrated himself before the gods and that thereby Atri restored the eye of the Heavens viz. the orb of the sun to its usual splendour and (with the favour of Indra and Varuna ) dispelled the wiles of Svarbhānu. It is probable that Atri and his family assured tbe common people that the sun would in a short time appear in all his glory. 'स्वर्भानुर्हासुर आदित्यं तमसाविध्यत्तस्यात्रयस्तमोपजिघांसन्त एतं सप्तदशस्तोमं त्र्यहं पुरस्ताद्विषुवत् उपायंस्तस्य परस्तात्तमोपजघ्नुः।' शाङ्कायनब्राह्मण 24.3.

It is stated in the Śaṅkhāyana Brāhmaṇa (24.3) that the Atris performed the Saptadaśa-stoma three days before Viṣuvat and thereby smote the demon Svarbhānu that had pierced the sun with darkness i.e. the solar eclipse (in g. V. 40.5 ff.) took place three days before the autumnal Viṣuvat (equinox).

It appears from the Br̥hat-samhitā that the real cause of eclipses was known to Indian astronomers several centuries before Varāhamihira (1st half of 6th century A. D.) who remarks[^622] 'In a lunar eclipse the moon enters into the shadow of the earth and in a solar eclipse the moon enters the Sun (i.e, comes between the sun and the earth), that this cause of eclipses was found by (former) ācāryas who had a divine insight; that Rāhu is not the cause (of eclipses); this is the true state that the śāstra (of astronomy) declares (or this is the real intent of śāstra)'. In spite of this correct theory of eclipses, common people and even learned men (not astronomers) then believed and do believe up to the present day that Rāhu is the cause of eclipses and regard an eclipse as a special occasion for bath, gifts, _japa_, śrāddha and the like. Varāhamihira makes an effort[^623] to square Śruti, Smr̥ti, popular belief and real astronomical doctrine by the remark that there was an Asura on whom a boon was conferred by Brahmā 'You will be gratified by a portion of the gifts and offerings made on an eclipse', that Asura remains present to receive his portion and that therefore it is metaphorically (poetically) said that he is Rāhu. Rationalism and popular traditions and superstition cannot go together. Some difference was made between an eclipse of the Sun and that of the moon.

[^622]: भूच्छायां स्वग्रहणे भास्करमर्कग्रहे प्रविशतीन्दुः। ... इत्युपरागकारणमुक्तमिदं दिव्यदृग्भिराचार्यैः । राहुरकारणमस्मिन्नित्युक्तः शास्त्रसद्भावः॥ बृहत्सं. V. 8 and 13.

[^623]: योऽसावसुरो राहुस्तस्य वरो ब्रह्मणाऽयमाज्ञप्तः । आप्यायनमुपरागे दत्तहुतांशेन ते भषिता । तस्मिन् काले सान्निध्यमस्य तेनोपचर्यते राहुः । बृहत्सं. V. 14-15.

## Eclipses of the Sun and the Moon

Vyāsa says: [^624] an eclipse of the moon is one hundred thousand times (more meritorious than an ordinary day) and an eclipse of the Sun ten times more so than the preceding and if the waters of the Ganges are near (for a bath) then a moon eclipse is one crore of times (more meritorious) and a sun's eclipse is ten times more so than the preceding'.

The first duty of a person on seeing an eclipse is to bathe. It is said 'on [^625] seeing Rāhu (i.e. eclipse) men of all _varṇas_ become impure. They should first bathe and then do their usual duties and should give up food already cooked (before the eclipse)'. Peculiar sanctity was deemed to attach to the time of grahaṇa. If a man [^626] does not take a bath at the time of eclipse, at the passage (of the sun) from one _rāśi_ to another, there is no doubt that he would suffer from leprosy for seven future lives and sorrow would be his lot.' He should take a bath in cold water and in as holy a place as possible. The holiest bath is the one in the Ganges or Godāvari or at Prayāga, then in any one [^627] of the big rivers such as the six rivers connected with Himavat mountain and the six south of the Vindhya mentioned in the Brahmapurāṇa, then in any other water, since at the time of eclipse all water becomes holy like Ganges water. A bath with hot water was allowed only to children, old men and persons that were ill. One had [^628] to take a bath when the eclipse began, to perform homa, worship of gods and śrāddha while the eclipse was in progress, to make gifts when the eclipse was about to end, and to take a bath again when the sun or moon became free from eclipse.

Even a person who is impure owing to a birth or death has to take a bath on an eclipse but he is not to make a gift or to perform śrāddha (according to Gauḍa writers), but the Madanaratna and the Nirṇayasindhu refute this view and hold that in an eclipse even one who is in āśauca can take a bath, perform śrāddha and puraścaraṇa.[^629] In the purāṇas and medieval digests some distinction as regards merit or holiness was made between eclipses in certain months and baths in certain rivers or holy places. The Kālanirṇaya (p. 350 ) especially commends the Godāvari for a bath in a lunar eclipse and one in the Narmadā for a solar eclipse. The Kr̥tyakalpataru (Naiyatakāla), Hemādri on Kāla and the Kālaviveka quote [^630] a long passage from the Devipurāṇa, some verses of which may be rendered here: 'an eclipse in Kārtika is the highest (in merit) at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā, in Mārgaśirṣa on Devikā, in Pauṣa Narmadā is holy, in Māgha Sannihitā is holy' &c. On the occasion of the partial eclipse of the sun on 20th June 1955 about four hundred thousand people took a bath at Kurukṣetra and Sanyahet (Sannihitā of ancient times).

The general rule is that one should not take a bath, make a gift or perform a śrāddha at night. Āpastamba [^631] says 'let him avoid a bath at night'. Manu says 'one should not perform a śrāddha at night, she (night) is declared to be a rākṣasi (a demon) and also at both twilights and when the sun has just risen'. But eclipses were an exception as regards bath, gift and śrāddha. Yājñavalkya enumerates [^632] eclipses among the proper times for śrāddha.

## Great value of gifts &c. in eclipse

It is stated by Śātātapa [^633] that gifts, baths, _tapas_ and śrāddha at the time of eclipses yield inexhaustible ( rewards or merit ); the night is a rākṣasi elsewhere ( at times other than those of eclipses ); therefore one should avoid it (in other matters). A passage is quoted from the Mahābhārata [^634] 'on _ayana_ and _Viṣuva_ days and on the occasion of the eclipses of the sun and the moon, one should make a gift of land together with dakṣiṇā to a deserving brāhmaṇa'. Yājñavalkya succinctly observes 'not by learning alone nor by _tapas_ alone (does one become a deserving person); that is declared a deserving person (_pātra_) in whom these two (_vidyā_ and _tapas_) and actions ( appropriate to these ) are found.' Numerous inscriptions published so far bear witness to the fact that over the whole of India ancient and medieval kings and well-to-do people carried out to the letter this recommendation of making gifts of land on eclipses. Some inscriptions are mentioned here by way of illustration. Vide for gifts on solar eclipses the following: I.A. VI. pp.72-75 (in śake 534 expired) the grant of a village to a brāhmaṇa of Tagara by the great king Satyāśraya Pulikeśī II on Bhādrapada amāvāsyā; E. I. Vol. III. pp. 1–7 the Paṭṭadakal pillar inscription of Western Cālukya Kirtivarman II recording a grant of fields on a total eclipse of the sun in Śrāvaṇa (Fleet calculates that it was 25th June 754 A. D.), E. I. Vol. III. pp. 103-110 Paithan Plates of Rāṣṭrakūta Govindarāja (III) recording the grant of a village after the king bathed in the Godāvari on a total solar eclipse in Vaiśākha of śaka year 716 (4th May 794 A. D.); E. I. VII, pp. 202-208 Sirur inscription of the time of Rāṣṭrakūtā Amoghavarsa I on a solar eclipse in Jyeṣṭha, of śaka year 788 (expired) on a Sunday (16th June 866 A. D.); E. I.

As regards śrāddha, it is often difficult to perform it at the time of an eclipse for two reasons. Most eclipses are partial and the time is short. Besides, there is a prohibition to eat food during an eclipse. A prājāpatya expiation is prescribed for partaking of food during an eclipse.[^635] It is therefore provided in some smr̥tis and digests that the śrāddha performed should be the āmaśrāddha or hemaśrāddha [^636]. Though the person performing śrāddha in an eclipse is deemed to reap great merit, the person partaking of śrāddha dinner is liable to undergo an expiation and is generally looked down upon. The Mitākṣarā on Yāj. I. 217–218 quotes the first quarter of a verse 'one should not eat during a solar or lunar eclipse'[^637]. Therefore a good brāhmaṇa cannot be easily secured and the performance of śrāddha with details is well-nigh impossible, even though Śātātapa and others state that it is obligatory : 'on seeing Rāhu (i.e. an eclipse) one should perform a śrāddha even at the cost of all his wealth; one who does not perform śrāddha then sinks like a cow in mud.'

Order of acts on an eclipse

247

The order of the several acts on an eclipse is : first bath in Ganges or other water, prāṇāyāma, tarpana, japa of Gāyatri, homa in fire with sesame with the vyāhrtis and the mantras for the planets as in Yāj. I. 300-301, then āmaśrāddha, gifts of gold, food, cows and land.

In these days most people except very sophisticated ones still take a bath on eclipses and make sone gifts also, but do not proceed further in the matter of eclipses. An eclipse is the best time for japa and for dīkṣā (initiation) and perfection in the mantras peculiar to various deities: 'one[^638] should engage in japa and the like while an eclipse of the sun or moon is in progress; one should not bathe nor eat food during that time, but when the sun and the moon are free from eclipse one should bathe and partake of food: one may engage in the japa of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III. 62.10) and it is laid down that if one does not engage in japa on an eclipse one becomes sinful. For dīkṣā as to mantras seven days from eclipse are allowed. Solar eclipse is the best time for dikṣā.

The Punyakāla (the holy period) in the case of eclipses lasts only as long as the eclipse is visible to the eye. Jābāli says [^639] 'In the case of sankrānti the puṇyakala is 16 kalās on both sides thereof, but in the case of a lunar or solar eclipse it lasts only so long as the eclipse is visible'. This leads on to a question that is very much discussed in the several medieval works and on which there is great divergence of views. Much emphasis is laid on the words 'yāvad-darśana-go-caraḥ' and

Tāhudarśane' occurring in several verses (quoted in the notes, [^633], [^639] &c.). The Kṛtyakalpataru ( Naiyatakāla ) argues that in those passages darśana' (being visible) is declared to be the cause or occasion of the several acts (snāna, dana &o.) to be performed in an eclipse, that an eclipse is an occasion only when it is known that it has occurred, and that knowledge must be derived from the eye and that

therefore when the sun or moon is screened from view by clouds one need not enter upon a bath and the like prescribed in the case of an eclipse.640 Hemādri on Kāla quotes this view and criticizes it in several ways. He first relies on Manu IV. 37 that prescribes that one should never see the sun when it is rising or setting or when it is eclipsed or is reflected in water or when it is in mid-sky. If actual seeing were necessary, that is an impossible condition as Manu has prohibited it and the result would be that one need not bathe when an eclipse is really on. He further says that sistas do observe bath &c. even if they do not actually see the eclipse. Therefore, he proposes that puṇyakāla exists so long as the eclipse is deduced to last from the śāstra ( of astronomy). The Kr̥tyaratnākara [^611] (pp. 625–26 ) discusses the question, remarks that snāna and the other prescribed actions should be performed during that period in which the eclipse can be seen. It was argued by some that an eclipse by itself (and not seeing it) is the occasion on which bath, gift &c. must be observed; to this the Kālaviveka [^612] gave the reply that, if mere existence of an eclipse were an occasion for bath, then the unacceptable con clusion would be that even if the moon were to be eclipsed (in some other country) according to astronomical calculations a person in a different country would have to undergo a bath by day for a lunar eclipse in a distant land. The Smr̥ti kaustubha and Samayaprakāśa 643 therefore lay down that what is meant by 'darśana-gocarah' is that when one knows from the astronomical science that the eclipse is capable of being seen with the eye in a particular country one should at the respective times perform bath and the like (even though one may not actually see it). The Samvatsara-pradīpa is quite explicit 'that is said to be an eclipse which can be observed by the eye; one

should perform religious acts on such an eclipse, but not on mere calculation.'

If a solar eclipse occurs on a Sunday and a lunar one on Monday, such a conjunction was called Cādāmani and it was laid down that a Cūdamani eclipse yields one crore of times as much merit as an eclipse on other week days.641

Some held that on the day previous to an eclipse one should observe a fast; but Hemādri provided that a fast was to be observed on the day of the eclipse. 645 A householder however who had a son living was not to observe a fast as laid down in a text.646

About partaking of food before, during and after an eclipse elaborate rules were laid down from comparatively early times. The Vispudharmasūtra 647 provides: 'one must not eat during an eclipse of the moon or sun; he should eat, after having previously taken a bath, when the eclipse is at an end; if the sun or moon have set before the eclipse was over he must bathe and on the next day he may eat again after having seen the sun rise! This is elaborated in two verses quoted in several works: 'One should not take food before a solar eclipse and also in the evening of the day of a lunar eclipse; and one should not eat when the eclipse is in progress; but when the sun or

moon is free from eclipse one may, after a bath, partake of food; when the moon is free from eclipse one may take food ( even at night thereafter ) provided it is not mahānisā; when the sun or moon sets before being free from eclipse, one should see them rising the next day, bathe and then partake of food'.

It was further prescribed that not only was one not to eat during an eclipse, but in the case of a lunar eclipse one was not to eat for three praharas (9 hours or 221 ghaṭikās) before the eclipse started and for four praharas before a solar eclipse starts, but this does not apply to children, old men and women.[^618] This period of three or four praharas before an eclipse was called and even now is called 'vedha'. The Kr̥tyatattva (p. 434) collects together in one place all the above propositions about taking food. Although these rules are not generally observed in these days by people in cities and by educated people, in the author's boyhood they were strictly observed by almost all adults educated or illiterate.

Certain astrological results were deemed to follow from eclipses. One or two are cited here for illustration. The Viṣṇudharmottara [^619] states that if in one and the same month there is first an eclipse of the moon and then of the sun, that occurrence would tend to create disputes between brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas, but if the opposite was the case, then there would be prosperity. The same purāṇa says that persons born on the nakṣatra on which there is an eclipse of the sun or moon suffer troubles unless they perform śānti rites (to avert the evil results). Hemādri (on Kāla pp. 392-93) quotes several verses from Garga about the prognostications derived from eclipses of the sun and moon when they are in certain nakṣatras. Atri provides :650 'When the moon and the sun are eclipsed in the nakṣatra of a man's birth, that forebodes disease, long journeys, death and great danger from the king (of the country)'.
