CHAPTER III 

Persons entitled to engage in Vratas, objects desired by means of Vratas, classifications of Vratas and literature on Vratas, times for Vratas 

One important matter is that of vratādhikāriṇaḥ (persons entitled to engage in a vrata). Persons of all castes including śūdras are entitled to perform vratas. Devala states: 123 there is no doubt that (men of) all varṇas are released from sins by observing vratas, fasts and restrictive rules of behaviour and by mortification (lit. heating) of the body. Women are also entitled to perform vratas. In fact the purāṇas and digests prescribe several vratas .for women alone. Manu, Viṣṇu Dh. S. and soveral purānas provide that a woman cannot perform a separate sacrifice, a separate vrata or a separate fast by herself, she is honoured in heaven by waiting upon her husband. 124 Visnu Dh. S. ( 25. 16 ) 125 further provides that a woman who observes a vrata in which a fast enters while her husband is alive deprives her husband of his life and herself goes to hell. Whatever act of benefit in the other world a woman does without the consent of her father, husband or son yields no fruit to her. 126 The medieval digests interpreted these verses as meaning that before performing a vrata, a maiden has to secure the consent of her father, a married woman of her husband and a widow of her son and that with the consent of the persons specified a woman

could perform an independent vrata for herself. The digests are supported in this view by the sūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita 127 that it is the rule for women that they should practise vratas, fasts, restrictive observances and worship (or sacrifices ) with the con sent of their husbands. The Lingapurana 128 provides : with the bidding (i.e. permission) of their husbands, women should per form japa, gifts, tapas and all else. Opinion was divided whether a woman could get homa performed through another. About the incapacity of women for mantras,129 vide Manu II. 66, IX. 18 and Yāj. I. 13. The Vyavahāramayukha following Parāśara held that a sūdra could get the homa in adoption130 performed through a brāhmaṇa and that the same rules apply to women and śūdras and therefore a woman could get a homa required in vrata per formed through a brāhmana. Rudradhara (author of Suddhi viveka) and Vācaspati held that a woman and a sūdra have no right to perform homa with Vedic mantras. The Nirnayasindhu131 supports the Vyavahāramayūkha on the question of homa in a vrata to be observed by a woman. But it appears that Nila kantha, author of the Vyavahāramayūkha, was of a different opinion when composing the Prāyaścittamayūkha.132 Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 78 note 186 on this point. It is provided in the Matsya that a woman who is pregnant or is recently delivered of a child should only observe nakta instead of a fast and a

maiden or other female who is impure (in monthly illness or otherwise) should get her, vrata performed through another, but, whether pure or impure, she may perform bodily acts (such as a fast) by herself (vide Tithitattva pp. 121-122). 

If a person is unable owing to disease or accident or the like to perform a vrata personally he could get it performed through a pratinidhi (a representative). Certain rules were laid down about this. It is stated in the Satyāsādha-srauta-sūtra 133 'there is no pratinidhi (representative or substitute) in the case of the owner (the Yajamāna), the wife, the son, the (proper ) place and time (for an act), the fire, the deity ( to be invoked such as Agni, Indra), a rite and a text (to be prescribed for being employed in a rite)'. All religious acts are arranged in three classes, viz. nitya (obligatory), naimittika (to be performed when a certain nimitta or occasion arises or event happens) and kāmya (per formed out of a desire to secure some object). Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 60-61 note 150 for further details. The Trikānda mandana 134 has the following rules about pratinidhi in these three kinds of acts. "No pratinidhi ( substituto ) is allowed in the cage of kamya rites, a substitute is allowable in the case of nitya and naimittika rites; some recognized a substitute even in a kāmya rite after it is once begun; there is no substitute for a mantra or the deity or the fire (Garhapatya, Ahavaniya or Dakṣiṇāgni), a kriyā (such as prayāja) or iśvara (the svāmin or yajamāna); some say that a substitute is not allowed in the case of (a prescribed) place or time. An agnihotrin can substitute, (if his wife is dead &c.) an image of her made of gold or kuśas but a woman cannot proceed with a rite putting forward some

substitute or effigy in place of the husband.' If a person is unable, after undertaking a vrata, to carry it out, he should get it done by a representative. Such representatives are: son, wife, brother, husband, a sister, a pupil, purohita (for daksiṇā) and a friend. Paithinasi 135 states that a wife might carry on the vrata undertaken by the husband and the husband may do so for the wife; if both are unable a stranger may carry it out; in this way there is no break of vrata. Kātyāyana136 says:--one who observes a fast for the sake of his father or mother, brother, husband and particularly for his guru secures one hundred-fold merit; if a person observes a fast on Ekādasi in place of his maternal grand-father and the like they and their representative each obtain the full fruit thereof. These rules about pratinidhi apply to men of all varṇas.137 

It is somewhat remarkable that the Vratārka quotes from Hemādri138 a passage of the Devīpurāna to the effect that even mlecchas were authorized to perform vratas, if they had faith in them. In the Santiparva (65. 13--25) Indra is made to say to king Māndhātā that even Yavanas, Kirātas, Gāndhāras, Cīnas, Sabaras, Barbaras, Sakas, Andhras and several others should serve their parents, they could perform rites laid down in the Veda, they could make offerings to their (deceased parents), may dig wells (for the use of all people ) and may make gifts to brahmanas.+++(5)+++ The Bhavisya-purana139 states that the Haihayas, Tālajanghas, Turks, Yavanas and Sakas desiring to reach the status of brāhmaṇas observed fasts on the first tithi ( pratipad).

Another remarkable matter is that the Mahābhārata provides that brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas should not engage in a continuous fast for more than three days and that vaiśyas and $ūdras can observe a continuous fast for two days only and a fast for three days is not laid down for these two classes by those who know dharma. Devala also has a similar provision, 140 

The bulk of the vratas practised in medieval and modern times are kāmya i. e. performed for the purpose of securing some object in this world or sometimes the next world or both. Most of the yratas are really secular though under the garb of religion and, though certain disciplines (such as fast, worship and celibacy, truthfulness) have to be observed, breathe a frankly materialistic attitude; they are meant to appeal to the ordinary human cravings that rule the whole world. The desired objects are legion and it is impossible to set them out in detail. Some idea about them may however be conveyed. The Agnipurāpa mentions dharma (punya), progeny, wealth beauty or good fortuno, virtues, fame, learning, long life, wealth, purity, enjoyment of pleasures, heaven and moksa (release from the round of births and deaths) as the objects to be sought by the observance of vratas. The Kalpataru 141 on vrata says that vrata is the highest means of securing the several lokas (such as Brahmaloka, Sivaloka, Vaikuntha) and the enjoyment of pleasures and triumph; that in Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali ages respectively kings Sujaya, Rāma, Dhanañjaya and Vikrama became lords of the whole world by means of vratas, that Saṅkara declared to Hari in various treatises that vrata is the one (supreme) observance for man, that though many observ ances are laid down in each yuga they do not come up even to

the 16th part of the observance of vratas, that the virtuous daughter of Vikrama named Vasundharā, residing in the country of Daśārṇa, attained mokṣa through vratas and that gods, sages, siddhas and others attained highest perfection by means of upayāsas (fasts). 

Classification of vratas: As the vratas to be treated of in this section are almost all self-imposed or voluntary, they may be divided into three classes. The Padmapurāṇa 142 observes: 'ahiṁsā ( abstaining from causing injury), truthfulness, not depriving a person of his property by wrongfully taking it, brahmacarya (continence), freedom from crookedness or hypo crisy---these are mental vratas that lead to the satisfaction (or favour) of Hari; eating once only in the day, nakta (eating only once after sunset), fast (for the whole day), not begging (i.e. subsisting on food that one gets without asking for it)-this is physical vrata for human beings; study of the Veda, recounting (the name of) Vispu, speaking the truth, freedom from backbiting these are vratas of speech. 

Another classification can be based on the time for which a vrata may last, i. e. only for a day or a fortnight (pakṣa), a month, season, ayana (time of the stay of the Sun in the northern or southern hemisphere), year, or years. A vrata may be for one year or for more years than one or for a person's lifetime. In speaking of vratas performed in a certain month, the question of an intercalary month will have to be considered and will be dealt with in the next section on Kāla etc. Similarly, the matter of tithis occupies a very large place in works on dharmaśāstra and will have to be discussed. The subject of Kāla and muhūrta will be dealt with in the next section. Though tithis properly pertain to that section, they will be dealt with here, since tithis are the most important topic in relation to the various obsery ances that are to be performed throughout a year as their basis. The largest number of vratas are tithi-yratas. It is therefore that Hemādri begins his treatment of individual vratas with tithi-vratas (from part I, p. 335 to part II p. 519) and passes on 

142 अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं ब्रह्मचर्यमकल्कता। एतानि मानसान्याहुतानि हरितुष्टये ॥ एकभुक्तं तथा नक्तमुपवासमयाचितम् । इत्येवं कायिकं पुंसां व्रतमुक्तं नरेश्वर ॥ वेदस्याश्ययन Facult: A Fairyora i ugraha TTC a TIT | TH IV. 84, 42-44, ATIF 37. 4-6 ( with slight variation); (on a) I. p. 321 quotes the first two verses from वराहपुराण and reads अकल्मषं for अकल्कता and उपवासादिक पत in the 2nd verse. अकल्कता is explained as अकुरिलता by the मिता. on या. III. 312 and as दम्भरहितता by अपरार्क. 

Classifications of vratas 

in order to vāravratas (part II pp. 520-592), naksatrayratas (part II pp. 593–706), Yogavratas (part II pp. 707-717), Karapa vratas (part II pp. 718–726), Saṅkrāntivratas (part II pp. 727 743), māsavratas (part II pp. 800-857), stuvratas (part II pp. 858-861 ), samvatsarayratas (part II pp. 862-867), prakırnaka (miscellaneous) vratas (part II pp. 867-1002). The Krtyakalpa taru (on vrata) on the other hand begins with vāravratas (pp. 8-34), then deals with tithiyratas (pp. 35-398), naksatra yratas (pp. 399-417), māsavratas (pp. 418-430), sankrāntiyratas (pp. 431-434), samvatsaravratas (pp. 434-451) and prakirna yratas (pp. 452-459). Most of the works on vrata 1420 after dealing with some general matters begin their treatment of vratas with tithiyratas. The Samayapradipa has a different mode of treatment, viz. that it begins with Ganośavratas (i. o. vratas in which Gaṇośa is the deity), then with vratas in which the Sun is the deity, then Sivayratas, Visnuvratas and so on. Some vratas are performed not only on a certain tithi, but also require the existence of a certain month or weekday or naksatra or all of these. Another classification may be based on the persons competent to perform vratas; most vratas are meant for all men and women; some like Haritālikā and Vaṭasāvitri are meant for women alone, some are to be performed by men alone; while there are others to be performed only by kings or ksatriyas or by vaisyas. 

There is an immense literature on vratas. There is no topic of Dharmaśāstra except probably that of tirthayātrā and of śrāddha on which the Purāṇas wax so eloquent as on vrata. Some of the Purāṇas contain thousands of verses on vrata. For oxample, the Brāhmaparya of the Bhavisyapurāṇa (in chapters 16-216) contains over 7500 verses and the Uttarakhanda of the samo Purāṇa over five thousand verses on vratas; the Matsya purāṇa (chapters 54–92 and 95–101) has about 1230 verses on vrata (most of which occur in the Padmapurāṇa V chap. 20 ff), the Varāhapurāṇa (chap. 39-65) spends about 700 verses and the Vispudharmottara about 1600 verses on vratas. On a modest calculation the Purāṇas contain about twenty-five thousand verses at least on vratas. It is difficult to draw a strict line between Vratas and utsavas; what are calloul utsavas have also an element of religious rites and conversely many vratas have some element of being a festival. In this work I have included

soveral observances which some people may regard as purely atsavas and not vratas at all. 

The topic of vratas is rather inextricably mixed up with discussions on Kāla and tithi. The nibandhas (commentaries and digests) on vratas are numerous. In this section I shall mention works that deal with vratas alone or with vratas in relation to trthis, but not works on kāla in general and muhūrta. This is rather an arbitrary arrangement and it is possible that there would be some repetition and overlapping. A verse in the Kālaviveka of Jimūtavāhana names seven predecessors that had expounded kāla in relation to religious rites, viz. Jitendriya, Saṅkhadhara, Andhūka, Sambhrama, Harivamsa and Yogloka. Some of these writers must have been earlier than the first half of the 11th century A. D. as in the Malamāsatattva Raghu nandana states that Andhūkabhatta mentions in his work how in sake 955 (1033–34 A. D.) there was on Amāvāsyā Tula sankrānti and the Vrścikasankrānti on the pratipad and again on Amāvāsyā Dhanus-sankrānti. This establishes that Andhūka bhatta wrote his works about 1035 A. D. But the works of all those seven writers on kāla have not yet been discovered. Two other works ascribed to king Bhoja of Dhārā 143 dealt among other matters with kāla and vratas (in the 2nd quarter of the 11th century). One of them, the Rājamārtanda, is available in Mss and, besides expounding the astrological significance of tithis, week days, pakṣatras, Yogas, deals (in versos 1136–1292 and 1327-1405) with several yratas and the proper times for them - viz. Ekādaśī, Saptamyarkavrata, Agastyārghyadāna, Sravana dvādaśī, Rohinyaṣtamī, Haritāli-caturthi, Durgotsava, Kaujā gara, Pretacaturdaśi, Sukharātri, Bhrātr-dyitīyā, Dipadāna, Kārtikasnāna, Māghasnāna, Maghāsaptami, Bhismāstamī, Pusyadvādaśī, Asokāstamı, Caitrāvali, Savitrivrata, Pāṣāṇaca turthi, Araṇyaṣasthi, Daśabarā, Saṅkranti. The Rājamārtanda has not so far as I know yet been published, though hundreds of verses therefrom aro quoted in the medieval digests. It is at present the earliest extant work of a nibandha form treating of vratas. Another work dealing with vratas and ascribed to Bhoja is the one cited as Bhūpāla-samuccaya or Bhūpāla-krtya samuccaya, or Krtyasamuccaya on vratas, danas &c. This

Works on vrata relied on 

last work has not yet been unearthed and is found quoted in such medieval digests as the Krtyaratnākara. 

Apart from the Vedic Literature, sūtras, epics, Purāṇas and Rājamārtanda, I mainly rely in this section on vratas on the following works (those that I consulted in ms. form being expressly indicated and the works being arranged in chrono logical order as far as possible): Krtyakalpataru ( portion on vratas) of Lakṣmidhara; Kālaviveka of Jīmātavāhana; Hemādri's Caturvargacintāmaṇi (on vrata); Samayapradipa of Srīdatta (ms.); Krtyaratnākara of Candaśvara; Kālādarśa of Adityasūri (ms.), Kālanirṇaya or Kāla-mādhava and Kāla. nirnayakārikā; Tithiviveka, Vratakālaviveka and Durgotsava viveka of Sūlapāni; Nirnayāmrta of Allādanātha; Varsakriyā. kaumudi of Govindānanda; Kālasāra of Gadādhara; the Tithi tattya, Ekādaśītattva, Janmāstamītattva, Durgārcanapaddhati, Krtyatattva and Vratatattva of Raghunandana, Vrataprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya) of Mitramiśra (ms. from Anūpa Sanskrit Library) and Samayaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); Samaya mayūkha or Kālamayūkha of Nislakantha; Vratārka of Saṅkarabhatta (ms.); Tithyarka of Divākara; Daśanirnaya 14 of Hārīta Venkatanātha; Vratodyāpana-kaumudi of Saṅkara bhatta Ghāre; Vratarāja of Viśvanātha; Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi of Vignubhatta; Ahalyā-kāmadhenu (ms. in Scindia Oriental Insti tute, 1767-1771 A.D.); Dharmasindhu of Kāśīnātha. Of these the most important for yratas are Kityakalpataru (from which even Homādri, and Krtyaratnākara borrow many passages), Hemādri on vrata, Kālanirnaya of Mādhava, Kștyaratnākara, Varsakriya kaumudi, the works of Raghunandana and the Nirnaya-sindhu. Works like Vratārka and Vratarāja, though exhaustive, borrow verbatim long passages from Hemādri and others. The treatment of vratas in several of the above-mentioned works is often uneven; for example, the Varsakriyākaumudi disposes of the observances of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tithis in two pages (28-30), while it devotes twenty-two pages to Ekadasi (pp. 42-64). 

It must be emphasized here that this section is concernod with the yratas described or mentioned in works on Dharmaśāstra. Even so the number of vratas is extremely large. No attempt is made here to include all vra!as observed by women or by

primitive tribes or by the illiterate people all over India or con tained in works written in the several regional languages such as Bengali, Hindi or Marathi. The inclusion of such obsery ances would entail an enormous amount of labour, would expand the work to huge proportions and would be beyond the proper scope of the History of Dharmaśāstra. Further, to tabulate all the vratas and festivals of all common people and to study the folk life of villagers, forest-dwellers and mountain inhabitants in the States of the continent of India would be beyond the capacity of a single worker and would require the co-operative effort of a large team of workers spread over years. When done, that work would be a monumental one on the social anthropology of India. In this connection I may mention Prof. B. K. Sarkar's work 'Folk element in Hindu culture' and the paper on a study of vrata rites in Bengal' contributed by Mr. S. R. Das145 to 'Man in India' (1952) vol. 32, pp. 207-245. Some writers have already published works dealing with the observances of common people such as Mrs. Stevenson's 'Rites of the twice-born', Underhill's 'Hindu religious year', B. A. Gupte's Hindu holidays and ceremonials', R. C. Mukerj's Ancient Indian fasts and feasts', Mr. Rigvedi's Marathi work on 'History of Aryan festivals' (ed. of 1924). In these books (except in the last and rarely in Underhill's) texts from Dharmaśāstra are generally conspicuous by their absence. 

Times for beginning Vratas: Apart from the vratas that have to be performed on certain fixed tithis or times, elaborate provisions are made that yratas in general and several other religious rites are to be begun only at certain auspicious times or in certain astrological conditions. A few of these are set out 

145. It should not, however, be supposed that I agree with all the propositions in the above two; for example, the meaning wbich Mr. S. R. Das assigos to Lakṣmi in Rg. X. 71. 2 (viz. beauty) is not acceptable to me. I hold that 'Laksmi' there also is the opposite of alaksmi as the word 'bbadrā' applied to Lakṣmi suggests and as in Rg. X. 155. 1 the idea of alaksmi is clearly conveyed. I do not subscribe to the view that the idea of a malignant spirit was unknown to the poets of Rgveda times and that they had to go to the aboriginal people for that idea. Note the verses 4* Fery: सख्यानि जानते भदैवां लक्ष्मीनिहिताधि वाचि अ. x. 71. 2; अरायि काणे विकटे गिरि pa Frare i finity Feather E TH I *. X. 155 1. The farthi (VI. 30) explains this verse at length and states that Bhāradvāja destroyed Alaksmi and the Bṛbad-devatā (VIII, 60) says that Rg. X. 71 removes Alaksmi. 

Proper times for vratas 

here by way of sample. Gārgya 146 says 'when Jupiter and Venus have set (i. e. are not observable owing to their being near the Sun in the sky) or when they are in the stage of being called bāla and viddha and in an intercalary month one should not begin a vrata nor perform its udyūpana (the rite of closing a vrata).' The childhood of Jupiter and Venus is a certain period after they set and senility (uğddhatva or vārdhaka) is a certain period preceding their setting. There is no unanimity on the length of these periods and the periods differ in different countries and also depend on whether there is a season of distress or difficulty, but Varāhamihira 147 states the longest provided should be accepted. The Rājamārtanda has several verses on this, one of which may be set out here: Venus 148 is bala for ten days when it rises in the west, but is bāla for three days after rising in the east; Venus is vrddha for one paksa. (15 days) when it rises in the east, but is vrddha for five days before it sets in the west. Gargya observes :149 Venus and Jupiter are (held to be bāla) in the Vindhyas whether in the east or west for ten days, but for seven days in the country of Avanti (of which Ujjayini was capital); in the country of Vanga (Bengal) and among Hūṇas (they are bāla) respectively for six and five days. It is further provided in the 150 Devipurāṇa that one should not under take any religious act when Jupiter or Venus is in the sign of the Lion. Similarly, Lalla 151 remarks that all (religious) actions are

condemned when done in what is called Gurvāditya (that is when the sun is in the house of Jupiter viz. sign of Pisces and when Jupiter is in the house of the Sun, viz. Lion). The Vratarāja remarks that one is to avoid Jupiter in the Lion sign for religi ous acts only to the north of the Narmadā and elsewhere only in Simhamsa (i. e. the first quarter of the naksatra Pūrvā-phalguni). The Ratnamālā 152 provides that Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious (confer success) in all (religious) acts; but on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday only such actions succeed as are expressly prescribed for performance on those days, Bhujabala remarks that Tuesday is unfavourable for all auspicious acts but that it is commended for agriculture, study (of the Sāmaveda) and for battles. 153 

The philosophical discussions on Time and on its division into year, ayana (the Sun's apparent motion in the two regions of the celestial sphere), plus (seasons), māsa (month), paksa (half month,) week, days &c. will be taken up in the next section. But the exact determination of the question as to the day on which a tithivrata is to be performed when the tithi spreads over two days occupies a very large space in works on dharmaśāstra. 

The word tithi by itself does not occur in the Rgveda and the other Vedic Samhitās. But the idea must have been there even in the Rgveda. Amāvāsyā is explained in later works as being of two kinds, viz. Sinīvāli (day on which aināvāsyā is mixed with the 14th tithi) and Kuhū (when amāvāsyā is mixed with the first tithi of the next fortnight). Similarly, Paurṇa māsi is of two kinds, Anumati (mixed with the 14th tithi) and Rākā (mixed with the Pratipal of the next paksa). In the Rgveda Sinivāli is 154 raised to the position of a divinity, is described as the sister of the gods, offerings are made to her and she is implored to bestow progeny on the worshippers. The Br. Up. VI. 4. 21 implores Sinivāli and the Aśvins to implant an

embryo in the wife. Rākā also 155 is similarly treated in the Rgveda (II. 32. 4-5 = Atharva VII. 48. 1-2). Rg. X. 59.6 and X. 167. 3 treat Anumati as a deity, prayers are offered to her to enable the worshippers to see the Sun going up and to bestow happiness and she is spoken of in the same breath with Soma, Varuna and Brhaspati. The Vāj. S. prays 156 May Anumati approve to-day of our sacrifice'. It should be noted that the Nirukta (XI. 29) holds 157 a discussion on Anumati and Rākā, viz. the Nairuktas (etymologists) say that Anumati and Rākā are goddesses (wives of gods), while the Yājñikas hold that they are two kinds of Paurṇamāsī; it is known (in Sruti) that the first Paurnamāṣi is Anumati and the later is Rākā. Similarly, the Nirukta holds a discussion on Sinivāli and Kuhū (XI, 31). The Atharvaveda (VI. 11. 3) mentions Prajāpati, Anumati and Sinivāli together. The word Kuhū occurs in the Atharvaveda and is applied to a deity that is invoked to come to the sacrifice and to bestow on the worshipper wealth and a heroic son. In the Tai. S. I. 8. 8.1 and Sat. Br. IX. 5. 1. 38 mention is made of these four, viz. of Anumati, Rākā, Sinīvāli and Kuhū, as recipients of caru (oblation of boiled rice). How these names were coined in the distant past is an insoluble riddle. Anumati can be derived from root man, but why the tithi of the Full Moon mixed with the 14th tithi was so called is more than anyone can say. Kuhū may be plausibly derived from kuha 'where' (as in Rg. I. 24. 10, X. 40. 2) as the day when the moon is invisible and when primitive people asked in wonder the question where does the moon go! But Rākā and Sinivāli defy attempts at any plausible etymology. Eminent philologists, instead of

admitting ignorance, are not wanting, who following the tradi tions of the very ancient etymologist Yaska (who says in Nirukta II. 1 'na tveva na nirbrūyā), suggest that the word Sinīvāli is made up by combining the Babylonian-Akkadian word "sin' (meaning moon) with Dravidian 'vel' (white light) 158 'Amāyāsyā' (New Moon) is addressed as a deity by itself in Atharva 159 VII. 79 (84) 1-4, the first of which calls upon Amāvāsyā to come to the sacrifice and bestow wealth and a valiant son and the second of which hints at the derivation of the word from 'amā' (meaning together' or 'home') and 'ras' (to dwell). The Sat. Br. 160 remarks "this king Soma i. e. the moon is the food of the gods; when he (the moon) is not seen on this night either in the east or in the west, he comes to this world (i. e. the earth) and enters the waters and the herbs here; he is the wealth of the gods and their food; when he dwells on this night together (with waters and herbs) it (that night) there fore is called 'Amāvāsyā'. The Ait. Br. (40.5) states that on amāvāsyā the moon enters the sun. The Āp. Dh. S. also echoes this idea that on the Amāyāsyā night the Sun and the Moon dwell together (are near each other). So amāvāsyā is so called either because the moon was supposed to dwell together with waters and herbs on the earth that night or because the Moon dwells in the Sun on that night. Darśa has the same sense as amāvāsy, and means the day on which the moon is seen by the sun alone (and by no one else)'. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1009 and note 2274. Names are sometimes given by contraries e. g. a fool is called a wise man or a brave person may be called 'timid'. Amāyāsyā may have been called darśa because the moon is not

Such etymologies are based on certaia assumptions for which there is absolutely no evidence whatever, such as the word Vel' being used by the Dravidians thousands of years ago, that the vedic Iodiaas were aware of both words "Sin' (moon) and 'Vel' used by different peoples and could weld them together thousands of years ago and had no word of their own to denote what is meant by Sinivāli.

seen that day (but would be visible the next day). Another tithi that is famous in the Vedic Literature is Astakā 161 (8th tithi after the full moon in any month, but particularly in Māgha) on which offerings were made to the pitrs (departed ancestors). Even in very remote times people could have easily marked the four main phases of the moon, viz. Full Moon, half moon (8th day there after when half of the moon's orb shines), Moon's total absence and 8th day thereafter; and after noting these phases it must not have been very difficult to make close calculations about the periods intervening between the Full moon and the half moon, the New moon and half moon. As a matter of fact the Tai. Br. 162 expressly says that the moon is worn away on the 15th and becomes full on the 15th i. e. before the Tai. Br. it was well known that there were 30 lunar days (tithis) in a lunar month. It is stated in the Sat. Br. 163 "the joints of Prajāpati, while he was engaged in creating beings, became loose (or collapsed); the samvatsara is indeed Prajapati and the joints of it (of samvatsara) are the two junctions of day and night, Paurṇamāsı, Amāyāsyā and the beginnings (first days) of the seasons'. The words Paurpamāsī and Amāvāsyā occur very frequently in the Atharvaveda, the Tai. S. and other Vedic texts, though the two words do not occur in the Rgveda. The Atharvavoda says 164 that Paurṇamāsi was the first among days and nights and was worthy of sacrifice. The Ait. Br. 165 has an interesting passage: "they

[ Sec. I, Ch. III 

(wise men) say that when a sacrificer dwells near his sacrificial fire, that is due to his thought that the gods will partake of his offerings, since they do not eat the offering of a sacrificer who does not abide by certain observances'. The opinion of the sage Paingi is that the sacrificer should stay near his sacrificial fires (or fast) on the previous Paurpamāsī (i. e. Paurṇamāsī mixed with 14th), while the opinion of Kausītaki is that he should do 80 on the later one (i. e. the Paurṇamāsi mixed with prati pad). The previous Paurṇamāsī is called Anumati, the later one is called Rākā, while the previous Amāvāsyā is called Siniyāli and the later one is called Kuhū. That is the tithi (on which a religi ous rite should be performed), it is the one, being associated with which the sun sets and the sun rises.” This passage shows that differences of opinion had arisen long before the time of the Ait. Br. as to on what day a particular rite associated with a certain fixed tithi was to be performed when the tithi was spread over two days. There are references in Tai. S. and the Brāhmaṇa literature which show that in those ancient days the duration of tithis and therefore the actual position of the moon could not sometimes be very accurately determined beforehand. A man about to perform an iṣti on New Moon (darśeṣtı) does certain acts that are done on the day previous to amāvāsyā such as using the sour curds from last night's milking for coagulating the sacri ficial food (i. o. milk), separating the calves from the cows in the afternoon with a palūsa twig; and taking some husked rice, he thinks, owing to cloudy weather or through miscalculation, that the moon would not be seen in the sky the next morning, does not actually set apart a few handfuls of husked rice (meant as nirvāpa for the gods) or gets them apart, then the next day the moon is seen in the sky (i. e. the next day is really 14th tithi instead of amāvāsyā). It is then prescribed that he has to perform an expiatory rito called Abhyuditesti. Vide Tai. S. II. 5.5.1-2 and Sat. Br. XI. 1. 4.1-% quoted 166 below.

Word tithi in ancient Literature 

67 

The word tithi does not occur in the Samhitās, but it occurs in the Ait. Br. cited above and in the gļhya and dharma sūtras. 

The Gobhilagrhyasūtra 167 when prescribing a day for the setting up of sacred fires mentions the coincidence of an auspici ous tithi and nakṣatra and in another place refers to the worship of the lord of the tithi and of the nakṣatra and of the tithi itself. The Kausītaki-gļhya (I. 25) speaks of offerings to the tithi on which a child was born and prescribes that the dedication of ponds, wells and tanks was to be made in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious tithi (V.2). 

The Nirukta 168 while deriving the word atithi applied to Agni in Rg. V. 4.5 gives two explanations, one of which is one who approaches the houses of others on special tithis'. Pāṇini furnishes no sūtra relating to the word tithi, but it is possible to argue that the affix titha which he mentions in explaining words like 'bahutitha '169 was a relic of the word tithi. Patañjali expressly mentioned Paurṇamāsi tithi. Vide ‘India Antiqua', the volume of studies presented to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel pp. 109-11% for Prof. Edgerton's paper on affix 'titha'. From the above discussion it would be clear that the ideas and divergences of views about the proper tithis for certain religious acts existed in the Vedic times (at least before Ait. Br.) three thousand years

Tithi is defined as the time or period required by the moon to gain twelve degrees on the sun. As the Sūryasiddhānta states "tithi is the lunar day in which the moon leaving the sun (at the last moment of Amāvāsyā), traverses twelve degrees (bhāgas) towards the east every day.'171 The moon's motion is irregular and therefore the moon traverses twelve degrees sometimes in 60 ghatikās, sometimes in more (up to about 65) and sometimes in less ghatikās up to about 54. The result is that one unit day may be co-terminous with one tithi, but often a unit day has two tithis i. e. in the morning it may be the 6th tithi, but in the afternoon, evening and night it may be the 7th. It is possible that in a single civil day (from sunrise to sunrise) there may be three tithis 0.g. on Monday morning there may be only two ghatikās left of the 6th tithi, then the 7th tithi may be only 56 ghatikās in duration and then the 8th may follow for the last two ghatikās of that unit day. Conversely, a single tithi may touch three days. For example, the last two ghatikās of Monday may be the first two ghatikās of the 6th tithi, then the 60 ghatikās of Tuesday may be occupied by the 6th tithi and two more ghatikās (the last) of the 6th tithi may spread on to Wednesday morning. A unit day which spreads over three tithis is declared by the Rājamārtanda to be very holy 172 (or auspicious); while on the other hand a tithi touching three days is said to be inauspicious for marriage, for marching on an invasion, for an auspicious religious act or an act meant to

advance prosperity. 173 If a tithi begins immediately before sunrise or its beginning coincides with sunrise and ends after the following sunrise the name of the tithi (as pratipad, dvitīyā or so on as the case may be) is coupled with both divasas (civil days) involved, so that two tithis of the same denomination appear one after another. This is called vṛddhi of the particular tithi. If a tithi begins sometime after sunrise on one morning and ends before sunrise on the following day it cannot be coupled with any day and is therefore deleted or omitted in the pancānga (almanac) and there is lithi-kṣıya. As a tithi is normally shorter than the civil day kṣaya occurs more frequently than vṛddhi. 

From the words of the Gobhilaghya quoted above it follows that long before the days of that work the several tithis were deemed to have certain deities as their lords (or presiding deities). Among the earliest extant enumerations about tithipatis (lords of tithis) is that in the Brhatsamhita of Varaha mihira (chap. 98. 1-2) which sets them 174 out as follows (the tithis and their lords being mentioned in order):-1st Brahmā, 2nd Brahmā, 3rd Hari, 4th Yama, 5th the moon, 6th Kārtikeya, 7th Indra, 8th Vasus, 9th Nāgas, 10th Dharma, 11th Siva, 12th Savit;, 13th Madana, 14th Kali, 15th Viśvedevas and of Amāyāsyā the pitrs. He further says that one should do on those tithis the acts that are appropriate to the lords of those tithis. It appears that other writers differed somewhat from Varāhamihira, 8. g. the Ratnamālā sets 175 out the lords of tithis according to the Purāṇas as follows:-1st Agni, 2nd Brahma, 3rd Girijā, 4th Gaṇośa, 5th Nāga, 6th Viśākha (Skanda), 7th the Sun, 8th Siva, 9th Durgā, 10th Yama, 11th Vispu, 12th Hari, 13th Madana, 14th Siva, 15th the Moon.

states what tithis are specially dear to what gods such as 8th and 14th to Siva, 4th to Ganesa, 9th to Capdikā. The Garuda (I. 137. 16-19 ) and Nārada-purāṇa (I. 56. 133–135) specify what deities are to be worshipped on the tithis from the first to 

15th. 

Varāhamihira divides tithis into five 176 groups, viz. Nanda, Bhadrā, Vijayā or Jayā, Riktā and Pūrnā and states that on those tithis the acts that are appropriate or suited to the lords of the tithis should be done and become crowned with success and the fruits of actions done on these five classes of tithis yield results similar to their names. The same applies to karaṇas and muhurtas. The result is Nandā tithis are 1st, 6th, 11th; Bhadrās are 2nd, 7th, 12th; Vijayās 3rd, 8th, 13th; Riktās are 4th, 9th and 14th; Pūrṇās are 5th, 10th, 15th. This is also brought out in the Atharvapa Jyotisa, which also prescribes what should be done or not done on the tithis from the 1st to the 15th and provides that certain combinations of tithis and certain weekdays yield success and all rewards, viz. Nandā tithi on Friday, Bhadrā on Wednesday, Jayā on Tuesday, Riktā on Saturday, and Pūrpā on Thursday. 

The Tithitattva (pp. 27-28) quotes a long passage specifying the loss a man suffers by eating fifteen specified things from the 1st to the 15th tithi respectively. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 32) quotes verses from Muhūrta-dīpikā and Bhūpāla 177 (i. e. Bhoja) which specify the edibles and certain actions that are respec tively to be given up on the tithis from the first to the 15th and on amāvāsyā. On the other hand, Bhavisyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva 16. 18-20) quoted by the Kalpataru on vrata p. 35 specially recommends the eating of certain things on each of the 15 tithis from pratipad (the first) viz. milk, flowers (on 2nd), anything

The Vāmanapurāpa 178 (14. 48–51) prescribes what actions should not be done on the groups of tithis called Nanda &c., on certain week days and on certain naksatras. 

The method of reckoning time by tithis is a very early one and is indigenous to India. Though Western scholars have from time to time put forward various theories about the so-called Greek influence on Indian astronomy and astrology and about the Indian Naksatra system being borrowed from the Chinese (Biot) or from the Babylonians (Weber ) or from the Arabs (Sedillot), no western scholar has had the courage, so far as I know, of alleging that the system of tithis is not indigenous but is borrowed from some non-Indian source. The theories about Greek influence will be briefly dealt with in the next section. 

Vedic (and Smrti) injunctions are of two kinds, (1) those that urge a person to do a thing such as 'one should fast on Ekādaśi in both paksas', (2) those that dissuade a person from doing something as in 'one should not eat food on Ekādaśī', Tithis are thus an anga of the two kinds of injunctions. Accord ing to Garga,179 tithi, naksatra and vāra (week day) are a means of punya (merit) and pāpa (demerit, sin) by being subsidiary to the principal rite prescribed, but they are not able to produce the above result independently.180 

Tithi is of two kinds, 181 pārṇā (complete or full) and sakhandā. When a single tithi covers the whole day from sun

rise for sixty nādikās (or ghatikās) the tithi is purnā, i. e. the tithi begins exactly at sunrise and ends with the next sunrise and is exactly 60 ghatikās in extent. All others than this are sakhanda; these latter again are of two kinds suddhā and viddhā (pierced by or intermixed with another).182 A śuddhā tithi is one that extends from sunrise to sunset or (in the case of some tithis like sivarātri) up till midnight; other sakhaqda tithis are called viddhā. Vedha is of two kinds, morning vedha and evening vedha; the former generally occurs when after six ghatikās from sunrise a tithi touches or gets merged with the next tithi, while the latter (evening vedha) generally occurs when a tithi touches another tithi six ghatikās before sunset. In the case of certain tithis the period prescribed may exceed six ghatikās. 

When the tithi in question is 60 ghatikās in extent and begins with sunrise (i. e. when it is pūrṇā) there is no difficulty at all. When a tithi is śuddhā in the sense given by the Dharmasindhu then also there is generally no difficulty. Some general rules have to be kept in mind. Sruti says 183 'forenoon is for the gods, midday for men and afternoon for pitrs'. Manu (IV. 152) says: one should carry out morning duties, decorating the body, bath, brushing the teeth, applying collyrium to the eyes and worship of gods in forenoon alone'. Therefore all religious acts prescribed for being performed by day on certain tithis for gods must be begun in the morning even if the tithi is mixed with another on that day, but all vratas to be performed in the evening or night have to be performed on the tithi exist ing in the evening or night even 184 though it may be mixed up (viddha) with another tithi. Another matter to be noted is that in both halves of the month all tithis may affect the previous tithi and following tithi by three muhūrtas (i. e. six nādis or ghatikās).185 Some tithis produce vedha by a larger number of ___182. आदित्योदयवेलाया आरम्य षष्टिनाडिकाः । तिथिस्तु सा हि शुद्धा स्यात्सार्वतिथ्यो द्ययं विधिः । इति कालमाधवीयधृतनारदीयात् । सा हि सुद्धा सैव शुद्धा नान्येत्यर्थः । ति. त. pp. 87-88; FTATUI F armaru: i faca CVEI FIIETET a que \#Tatu angry I, 56. 154.

ghatikas e. g. the 5th makes sasthi affected by twelve nādis, 10th makes 11th viddhā by 15 nādis, &c. Viddhā tithis are in some cases fit for performing religious acts, sometimes they are not. All rites 186 of the śrauta or smārta type, vrata, dāṇa and every other act enjoined by the Veda do not yield proper reward as long as there is no determination of the tithi proper for it. That tithi which covers up the time (such as morning), noon, whole day &c. at which a religious act is prescribed to be done is the proper one for 187 that act. The first principle to 188 remember is that Kāla (the time prescribed for a rite) is not a mere detail, but it is a nimitta (an occasion) on the happening of which a rite is to be performed and that therefore what is done at some time other than the prescribed one is practically as good as not done. There is a text of the Tai. S. II. 2. 5. 4 which indicates this principle about Kāla. It says 'that man is cut off from the heavenly world, who desiring to perform the darśa pūrpamāsa rites transgresses the time of full Moon or Now Moon'. Hemādri 189 strongly emphasizes the performance of rites

on the proper time and states that a gaupakāla is resorted to for escaping from the censure of śistas or for the solace of one's mind or because there is no other alternative. If a tithi can be had on two days and at the required time or if it does not exist on both days at the time required or it extends only up to a part of the time for which it is required, then the decision is arrived at, as a general rule, by what is called 'yugmavākya' to be cited below. 190 Suppose, for example, that a vrata is to be performed at noon on a certain tithi, then that tithi may exist at noon on two days or suppose that the tithi begins one or two ghatikās after noon and ends on the next day one or two ghatikās before noon, then the decision as to which tithi (whether pūrva-viddhā or para-viddhā) is proper for the act would have to be decided as a general rule by the Yugmavākya. The Yugmavākya may be translated as follows: "The pairs (or combinations) of the following tithis lead to great reward, viz. of the 2nd and 3rd tithis, of the 4th and 5th, of the 6th and 7th, of the 8th and 9th, of the 11th and 12th, of the 14th with pūrpimā (Full moon tithi) and of Amāvāsya with the 1st: the reverse (i. e, combinations or pairs of other tithis) results in great loss; such combinations destroy all former (accumulated) merit. In these verses there are seven pairs and they are mutually applicable. The question may be asked: on what tithi a vrata prescribed for the 2nd tithi should be performed if the 2nd is combined with the first on one day (that is, it is pūrvaviddhā) and is also combined with the 3rd on the next day (i. e. it is para viddhā). The reply is: as a general rule the day on which the 2nd is combined with the 3rd tithi should be the proper one for the dvitiyāvrata and not the day on which 2nd tithi is combined with the first. Similarly, in the case of a yrata to be performed on tṛtīyā, if the 3rd tithi occurs on one civil day combined with the 2nd and on the next day it is combined with the 4th, then the proper day as a general rule for a trtīyā-vrata is the one on which the 2nd and 3rd tithis are in combination and not the other day on which the 3rd and 4th tithis combine. The result of this passage is that combinations of 1st and 2nd tithi, of the 3rd and 4th, of 5th and 6th, of 7th and 8th, of the 9th and 10th, of the 10th and 11th, of 12th and

13th, of 13th and 14th, of Purnima with the first and of Amavasya with 14th are generally excluded as improper.191 

It may be stated here that the rules laid down in the above verses (of yugmavākya) are riddled with exceptions. Some say that these rules apply only to tithis of the bright half and not to those of the dark half. But many works such as Aparārka (p. 216), Kalanirnaya (p. 172), Vratakālaviveka (P.O. vol. VII. p. 87), Nirnayasindhu (p. 18) hold that the passage applies to tithis of the dark half also, since the express mention of Amāvāsyā in combination with pratipad is an indication in that direction. It would be noticed that the yugmavākya (oven though held to be applicable to the dark half) does not refer to the first tithi of the dark half, the 10th and 13th tithis of both halves. Their combinations with the preceding or following tithis will be governed by express texts where available and by other considerations in other cases, such as the verse 'in the bright half that tithi should be preferred which exists at the time the sun rises and, in the dark half, that tithi should be preferred which exists when the sun sets.' 192 Another important rule is that where there are express texts prescribing a particular com bination of viddhā tithis as more appropriate for a vrata or other

The कालादर्श (folio 9a) ascribes the verses to पैठीनसि. They are the same as राजमार्तण्ड folio 69 band 70a, verses 1123-24 (ABORI vol. 36p 309).

religious rite, that express rule prevails and not the rule derived from this yugmavākya.193 For example, it is laid down in the very place (where the yugmavākya occurs) that the 6th tithi, 8th tithi, amāvāsya and the 13th of the dark half are to be preferred (for religious rites) when in combination with the following tithis (i. e. 7th, 9th, 1st of bright half and 14th of dark half respectively) and others (than those mentioned in the first half such as the 7th, 9th) are to be preferred when combined with those preceding them.194 The application of special considera tions may be further illustrated by the following. The same tithi may be preferred if pārzaviddhā'in one vrata and as para viddhā in other cases owing to the difference in the deities of the vratas. For example, Skandaṣasthi is preferred as pūrvaviddhā, but Mandārasasthi is preferred as paraviddha (because the deity is Mandāra and not Skanda). Sometimes, although the devatā is the same, it will have to be pūrvaviddhā and sometimes paraviddhā as in the Vinayaka-vrata which requires mid-day as the proper time. If the 4th exists at midday and then is mixed up with 5th, but did not exist at midday the previous day, then 4th mixed with 5th will be preferred; but if mixed with the 3rd before noon and not mixed with 5th at time of midday, 4th mixed with third will be preferred. Sometimes it depends on the fact whether it is bright or dark fortnight. Sukla pratipad will be preferred if pūrvaviddhā, but kļṣṇa pratipad will be pre ferred as uttaraviddhā. The rites for pitrs are not governed by yugma-vākya. The gļhya-parisista provides that the pitss attend on that tithi which exists at the time when the sun sets ; that tithi and afternoon are assigned for the pitrs by Brahmā himself.195 Sometimes even a combination not approved by yugmavākya has to be accepted for the performance of a rite e. g. when astamī with Rohini naksatra exists (in Krṣnajanma vrata) the fast should be observed on that Astami, though it may be combined with 7th tithi (and not on 9th as yugmavākya

According to this verse of Pracetas there is to be no upavāsa on the Ekādasi, though it is pārṇā, but the fast will be observed on Drādasi, and the pāraṇā in order to be celebrated on dvādaśī will have to be during the first ghatikā of the third day from ekādasi or earlier. But if the Drādaśī in this case be only for 55 ghatikās, trayodaśī will begin three ghatikās before sunrise; if pāraṇā be done at sunrise it will be on the 13th and not on the 12th. In this latter case, according to Pracetas, the Upavāsa will have to be on the pūrṇā Ekādaśī in order that the piraṇā may be on 12th. It has to be further remembered that the positive prescrip tion about celebrating a vrata or the like on the fixed tithi is governed by the yugmavākya, but the rules forbidding the partaking of oil, meat or the like on the fixed tithi apply for the whole of that day198 and that tithi, whether it is 65 ghatikās and extends over three days or is only 55 ghatikās and extends over two days only. For explaining the words "eka dasyām nirāhāraḥ' from Varāha-purāṇa ( 39. 32 ) the Ekādasi tattva (pp. 3-4) states that one is to fast not inerely for the time that the Ekādaśī lasts on a week-day but for the whole of the week day on which Ekadasi falls and it applies the reason ing contained in Jai. VI. 2. 19-20 (called Kalañjādhikarana). If the vrata is such that some items in it are to be done by day and some at night, then that vrata must be observed on that tithi which exists by day as well as at night and in such a case

the yugmavākya has no application. Vide p. 72 and note 184 above. In certain cases where the vrata has several iterns extend ing over the whole day or a large part of it, the tithi at the time of sunrise even if it be only for a ghaṭikā is declared by some texts to be sakalā (pārṇā ) for purposes of both gifts and vratas.199 

The Kālā darśa propounds the strange 200 theory based on Gobhila's words that the shortening and lengthening of the tithis is due to the piety and sinfulness of men and divides tithis into khurra (of proper extent, 60 ghatikās), darpa (more extensive than 60ghatikās) and himsra or himsa (of lesser extent than 60 ghatikās). The Rajamzrtanda has the same 201 division and remarks that when the tithi is either kharva or darpa (and they are viddhā.) then a rite is to be done on the later tithi (the proper tithi joined to the next one) and in the case of the shorter tithi (if it is viddha) one should prefer the former (i. e. the day on which the proper tithi is joined to an earlier one).202 The Varsa

This is one of the cases where a tithi though kbandā according to strict astronomical rule is to be regarded as full (or sakala) for Dharma sastra purposes.

kriyā-kaumudi ascribes a similar verse to Uśanas and remarks that it is opposed to the dicta of many such sages as Dovala and must be restricted only to Darśaśrāddha forming as it does a syntactical whole with certain yerses of the Chandogaparisista (which it quotes). 

A general rule is stated in some works that when the full moon which is in the lunar mansion that gives the name to a month is in conjunction with Jupiter that tithi has the word mahā prefixed to it. For example, the Paurpimā of Kārtika would be called Mahikartiki if the Moon and Jupiter are both in the Kṛttikās (Pleiades) on that tithi. The Rāja mārtanda and Bhavisyapurāṇa provide that a bath on the Mahācaitrī and (on the remaining eleven paurnimās with prefix mahā) in certain holy places yields great rewards, viz. bath at Prayāga on Mahāmaghi, on Mahāphālguns in the Naimisa forest, on Mahācaitrī at Salagrāma, on Mahavaisakhi at Mahādvāra, on Mahājyaisthi at Purusottama, on Mahasādhi at Kanakhala, on Mahāśrāvani at Kedara, on Mahābhādri at Badarl, on Mahāśvini at Kubjāmra, on Mahākārtiki at Puskara, on Mahāmārgaśīrṣi at Kānyakubja, on Mahāpausi at Ayodhyā 203 

There are long lists of actions forbidden on certain tithis. A few passages may be cited here. Devala 204 says 'on the 15th, the 14th and particularly on the 8th one should avoid oil, meat, sexual intercourse and the use of a razor.' The Nāradiya provides
