CHAPTER III

Persons entitled to engage in Vratas, objects desired by means of Vratas, classifications of Vratas and literature on Vratas, times for Vratas

One important matter is that of vratādhikāriṇaḥ (persons entitled to engage in a vrata). Persons of all castes including śūdras are entitled to perform vratas. Devala states: [^123] 'there is no doubt that (men of) all _varṇas_ are released from sins by observing vratas, fasts and restrictive rules of behaviour and by mortification (lit. heating) of the body. Women are also entitled to perform vratas. In fact the purāṇas and digests prescribe several vratas .for women alone. Manu, Viṣṇu Dh. S. and several purāṇas provide that a woman cannot perform a separate sacrifice, a separate vrata or a separate fast by herself, she is honoured in heaven by waiting upon her husband[^124]. Viṣṇu Dh. S. ( 25. 16 )[^125] further provides that a woman who observes a vrata in which a fast enters while her husband is alive deprives her husband of his life and herself goes to hell. Whatever act of benefit in the other world a woman does without the consent of her father, husband or son yields no fruit to her[^126]. The medieval digests interpreted these verses as meaning that before performing a vrata, a maiden has to secure the consent of her father, a married woman of her husband and a widow of her son and that with the consent of the persons specified a woman could perform an independent vrata for herself.

[^123]: व्रतोपवासनियमैः शरीरोत्तापनैस्तथा। वर्णाः सर्वेपि मुच्यन्ते पातकेभ्यो न संशयः॥ देवल q. by हे. (व्रत) I. p. 326, व्रतार्क folio 4a.

[^124]: नास्ति स्त्रीणां पृथग्यज्ञो न व्रतं नाप्युपोषणम् । पतिं शुश्रूषते येन तेन स्वर्गे महीयते ॥ मनु. V. 155, विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 25. 15. The मार्कण्डेयपुराण reads the 2nd half as 'भर्तृशुश्रूष्यैवैता लोकानिष्टान् व्रजन्ति हि' and आदित्यपुराण as 'पतिं शुश्रूषते या तु तेन स्वर्गे महीयते॥'. Vide हे. (on व्रत) I p. 326 and व्र. का. वि. p. 11.

[^125]: पत्यौ जीवति य योषिदुपवासं व्रतं चरेत्। आयुः सा हरते भर्तुर्नरकं चैव गच्छति॥ विष्णुधर्मसूत्र 25, 16. व्रतार्क folio 5 quotes it and explains'इति विष्णुवचनं भर्त्रननुञा परम्।'अङ्गिरस् (v.40) is almost the same.
[^126]: नारी खल्वननुज्ञाता पित्रा भर्त्रा सुतेन वा। विफलं तद्भवेत्तस्या यत्करोत्योर्भ्वदेहिकम्॥ आदित्यपुराण q. by हे. (on व्रत ) I. p. 327, नि.सि. p. 22, 77. ग्य.म p. 113 ( ascribes to कात्यायन); हेमाद्रि explains' पित्रेति कन्यात्वे भर्त्रेति सौभाग्यदशायां मुतेति वैधव्यदशायाम्'।.

 The digests are supported in this view by the sūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita [^127] that it is the rule for women that they should practise vratas, fasts, restrictive observances and worship (or sacrifices ) with the consent of their husbands. The Lingapurana[^128] provides : with the bidding (i.e. permission) of their husbands, women should perform japa, gifts, _tapas_ and all else. Opinion was divided whether a woman could get _homa_ performed through another. About the incapacity of women for mantras,[^129] vide Manu II. 66, IX. 18 and Yāj. I. 13. The Vyavahāramayūkha following Parāśara held that a sūdra could get the homa in adoption[^130] performed through a brāhmaṇa and that the same rules apply to women and śūdras and therefore a woman could get a homa required in vrata performed through a brāhmana. Rudradhara (author of Suddhiviveka) and Vācaspati held that a woman and a sūdra have no right to perform homa with Vedic mantras. The Nirṇayasindhu[^131] supports the Vyavahāramayūkha on the question of homa in a vrata to be observed by a woman. But it appears that Nilakaṇṭha, author of the Vyavahāramayūkha, was of a different opinion when composing the Prāyaścittamayūkha.[^132] Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. p. 78 note 186 on this point. It is provided in the Matsya that a woman who is pregnant or is recently delivered of a child should only observe _nakta_ instead of a fast and a maiden or other female who is impure (in monthly illness or otherwise) should get her, vrata performed through another, but, whether pure or impure, she may perform bodily acts (such as a fast) by herself (vide Tithitattva pp. 121-122).

[^127]: व्रते स्थिता पत्यौ जीवत्यपि भर्तुरनुज्ञया व्रतादिपरा-कामं भर्तुरनुज्ञया व्रतोपवास नियमेज्यादीनामारम्भः स्त्रीधर्मः- इति शङ्कलिखितस्मरणात् । स्मृतिच. II. p. 291 , समयप्रदीप folio 5 band व. क्रि. कौ. p. 67 (read नियमेज्यादीनामभ्यासः).

The नि. सि. (pp. 29-30) holds that in परशर there is no question of employing a brāhmana as an agent or substitute, but all that Parāśara means is that a religious action when carried out by brāhmaṇas yields the fullest rewards.

Vratādhikūriṇaḥ



If a person is unable owing to disease or accident or the like to perform a vrata personally he could get it performed through a _pratinidhi_ (a representative). Certain rules were laid down about this. It is stated in the Satyāśāḍhaśrautasūtra[^133] 'there is no pratinidhi (representative or substitute) in the case of the owner (the _Yajamāna_), the wife, the son, the (proper ) place and time (for an act), the fire, the deity ( to be invoked such as Agni, Indra), a rite and a text (to be prescribed for being employed in a rite)'. All religious acts are arranged in three classes, viz. _nitya_ (obligatory), naimittika (to be performed when a certain _nimitta_ or occasion arises or event happens) and kāmya (performed out of a desire to secure some object). Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV pp. 60-61 note 150 for further details. The Trikāṇdamaṇḍana[^134] has the following rules about _pratinidhi_ in these three kinds of acts. "No pratinidhi ( substituto ) is allowed in the cage of kamya rites, a substitute is allowable in the case of nitya and naimittika rites; some recognized a substitute even in a kāmya rite after it is once begun; there is no substitute for a mantra or the deity or the fire (Gārhapatya, Āhavaniya or Dakṣiṇāgni), a kriyā (such as _prayāja_) or iśvara (the svāmin or _yajamāna_); some say that a substitute is not allowed in the case of (a prescribed) place or time. An _agnihotrin_ can substitute, (if his wife is dead &c.) an image of her made of gold or kuśas but a woman cannot proceed with a rite putting forward some substitute or effigy in place of the husband.'

[^133]: न स्वामित्वस्य भार्यायाः पुत्रस्य देशस्य कालस्याग्नेर्देवतायाः कर्मणः शब्दस्य च प्रतिनिधिर्विद्यते। सत्यषाढ्श्रौत  III. 1. Compare आप. श्रो. 24, 4, 1 and . VI. 3. 18-21 for similar rules, particularly VI. 3. 18 and 21 'न देवताग्निशब्दक्रियमन्यार्थसंयोगात्। तथा स्वामिनः फलसमवायात् फलस्य कर्मयोगित्वात् '.

[^134]: काम्ये प्रतिनिधिर्नास्ति नित्ये नैमित्तिके हि सः। काम्येप्युपक्रमादूर्ध्वमन्ये प्रतिनिधिं विदुः ॥ न स्यात् प्रतिनिधिर्मन्त्रे देवेग्नौ कर्मणीश्वरे । न च प्रतिनिधिर्देशकालयोरित्यथापरे । ... सौवर्णी कुशपत्नी वा पत्न्यभावेऽग्निहोत्रिणः । ... पत्युः प्रतिनिधिं कृत्वा पत्नी नैवं समाचरेत् ॥ त्रिकाण्डमण्डन II. 2-3 and 8. गोभिलस्मृति III. 10 states that when Rāma performed solemn sacrifices he had by his side the golden image of Sītā, Vide Aparārka pp. 114-115 and Sm. C. 1. p. 167 for discussion whether an image of gold or kuśas can be a proper substitute for absent or dead wife. नि. सि. p. 30 and व्रतराज p. 13 quote the above verses of त्रिकाण्डमण्डन somewhat differently. The first verse is quoted by तिथितस्व p. 71 (reads last pāda as 'केचिदिच्छन्ति सत्तमाः).

 If a person is unable, after undertaking a vrata, to carry it out, he should get it done by a representative. Such representatives are: son, wife, brother, husband, a sister, a pupil, purohita (for dakśiṇā) and a friend. Paiṭhīnasi[^135] states that a wife might carry on the vrata undertaken by the husband and the husband may do so for the wife; if both are unable a stranger may carry it out; in this way there is no break of vrata. Kātyāyana[^136] says:--one who observes a fast for the sake of his father or mother, brother, husband and particularly for his guru secures one hundred-fold merit; if a person observes a fast on Ekādaśī in place of his maternal grand-father and the like they and their representative each obtain the full fruit thereof. These rules about pratinidhi apply to men of all _varṇas_[^137].

It is somewhat remarkable that the Vratārka quotes from Hemādri[^138] a passage of the Devīpurāna to the effect that even mlecchas were authorized to perform vratas, if they had faith in them. In the Śantiparva (65. 13--25) Indra is made to say to king Māndhātā that even Yavanas, Kirātas, Gāndhāras, Cīnas, Śabaras, Barbaras, Śakas, Āndhras and several others should serve their parents, they could perform rites laid down in the Veda, they could make offerings to their (deceased parents), may dig wells (for the use of all people ) and may make gifts to brahmanas. The Bhaviṣya-purāṇa[^139] states that the Haihayas, Tālajanghas, Turks, Yavanas and Śakas desiring to reach the status of brāhmaṇas observed fasts on the first tithi ( _pratipad_).

[^135]: प्रतिनिधयश्च निर्णयामृते पैठीनसिः। भार्या पतर्युव्रतं कुर्याद्भार्यायाश्च पतिर्व्रतम् । असामर्थ्ये परस्ताभ्यां व्रतभङ्गो न जायते ॥ नि. सि. p. 29; का. नि. p. 262 quotes पैठीनसि.

[^136]: कात्यायनः । पितृ-मातृ-भ्रातृ-पतिगुर्वर्थे च विशेषतः। उपवासं प्रकुर्वाणः पुण्यं शतगुणं लभेत् । मातामहादीनुद्दिश्य एकादश्यामुपोषणे । कृते ते तु फलं विप्राः समग्रं समवाप्नुयुः॥ का.नि. pp. 262-263, नि. सि. I. p. 29; असामर्थ्य शरीरस्य व्रते च समुपस्थिते । कारयेद्धर्मपत्नीं वा पुत्रं वा विनयान्वितम् । भगिनीं भ्रातरं शिष्यं ब्राह्मणं दक्षिणादिभिः । पितृमातृपतिभ्रातृस्वसृगुर्वादिभूभुजाम् । अदृष्टार्थमुपोष्यापि स्वयं च फलभाग्भवेत् ॥ वराहपुराण q. by व.क्रि. कौ. p. 58, हेमाद्रि (on व्रत) vol. I. p. 1004.

Purpose of most vratas

55

Another remarkable matter is that the Mahābhārata provides that brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas should not engage in a continuous fast for more than three days and that vaiśyas and Śūdras can observe a continuous fast for two days only and a fast for three days is not laid down for these two classes by those who know _dharma_. Devala also has a similar provision[^140].

The bulk of the vratas practised in medieval and modern times are kāmya i.e. performed for the purpose of securing some object in this world or sometimes the next world or both. Most of the vratas are really secular though under the garb of religion and, though certain disciplines (such as fast, worship and celibacy, truthfulness) have to be observed, breathe a frankly materialistic attitude; they are meant to appeal to the ordinary human cravings that rule the whole world. The desired objects are legion and it is impossible to set them out in detail. Some idea about them may however be conveyed. The Agnipurāṇa mentions _dharma_ (puṇya), progeny, wealth beauty or good fortune, virtues, fame, learning, long life, wealth, purity, enjoyment of pleasures, heaven and mokśa (release from the round of births and deaths) as the objects to be sought by the observance of vratas. The Kalpataru[^141] on vrata says that vrata is the highest means of securing the several _lokas_ (such as Brahmaloka, Śivaloka, Vaikuṇṭha) and the enjoyment of pleasures and triumph; that in Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali ages respectively kings Sujaya, Rāma, Dhanañjaya and Vikrama became lords of the whole world by means of vratas, that Śaṅkara declared to Hari in various treatises that _vrata_ is the one (supreme) observance for man, that though many observances are laid down in each _yuga_ they do not come up even to the 16th part of the observance of vratas, that the virtuous daughter of Vikrama named Vasundharā, residing in the country of Daśārṇa, attained _mokṣa_ through vratas and that gods, sages, _siddhas_ and others attained highest perfection by means of upavāsas (fasts).

[^140]: ब्रह्क्ष्त्रे त्रिरात्रं तु विहितं कुरुनन्दन। चतुर्थभक्तक्ष्पणं वैश्ये शूद्रे विधीयते। त्रिरात्रं न तु धर्मज्ञैर्विहितं धर्मदर्शिभिः॥ अनुशासनपर्व 106. 11 and 13; वैश्याः शूद्राश्च ये मोहादुप्वासं प्रकुर्वते। त्रिरात्रं पञ्चरात्रं वा तयोः पुष्टिर्न विद्यते॥ देवल q. by व. क्रि. कौ. p. 67 which remarks: पुष्टिः फलम्। एतेन काम्यस्यैव निषेधः।. This verse of देवल is almost the same as अनुशासन 106. 12 which reads ' प्रचक्रिरे। त्रिरात्रं वा द्विरात्रं वा तयोन्युर्ष्टि '. व्र. प्र. folio 9 b reads व्युष्टिः (which means फलं).

[^141]: कीर्तिसन्ततिविद्यादि-सौभाग्यारोग्यवृद्धये । नैर्मल्यभुक्तिमुक्त्यर्थ कर्वेु व्रतपते व्रतम् ॥ धर्मे देहि धनं देहि सौभाग्यं गुणसन्ततिम् । कीर्ति विद्यां देहि चायुः स्वर्गे मोक्षं च देहि मे॥ अग्नि 175 44 and 57. व्रतमेव परं लोकसाधनं भोगसाधनम्। व्रतनैव जयो यस्मात्तस्मात्सर्वो व्रतं चरेत् ॥ ... एको धर्मो मनुष्याणां व्रतमेव महात्मना। प्रोक्तो नानाविधैस्तन्त्रैः शङ्करेण हरिं प्रति ॥ सन्ति यद्यपि भूयांसो लोके धर्मा युगे युगे। तथापि व्रतधर्मस्य कलां नार्हन्ति षोडशीम् ॥ देवता दितिपुत्राश्च सिद्धा गन्धर्वकिन्नराः। ऋषयश्च परां सिद्धिमुपवासैरवाप्नुवन् ॥ कल्पतरु (on व्रत) pp. 1-2, हे. on व्रत  I. p. 318 (for last verse ).







Classification of vratas: As the vratas to be treated of in this section are almost all self-imposed or voluntary, they may be divided into three classes. The Padmapurāṇa[^142] observes: 'ahiṁsā ( abstaining from causing injury), truthfulness, not depriving a person of his property by wrongfully taking it, _brahmacarya_ (continence), freedom from crookedness or hypocrisy---these are mental vratas that lead to the satisfaction (or favour) of Hari; eating once only in the day, _nakta_ (eating only once after sunset), fast (for the whole day), not begging (i.e. subsisting on food that one gets without asking for it)-this is physical vrata for human beings; study of the Veda, recounting (the name of) Viśṇu, speaking the truth, freedom from backbiting these are vratas of speech.

Another classification can be based on the time for which a vrata may last, i.e. only for a day or a fortnight (pakṣa), a month, season, _ayana_ (time of the stay of the Sun in the northern or southern hemisphere), year, or years. A vrata may be for one year or for more years than one or for a person's lifetime. In speaking of vratas performed in a certain month, the question of an intercalary month will have to be considered and will be dealt with in the next section on Kāla etc. Similarly, the matter of tithis occupies a very large place in works on dharmaśāstra and will have to be discussed. The subject of Kāla and muhūrta will be dealt with in the next section. Though tithis properly pertain to that section, they will be dealt with here, since tithis are the most important topic in relation to the various obsery ances that are to be performed throughout a year as their basis. The largest number of vratas are tithi-vratas.

[^142]: अहिंसा सत्यमस्तेयं ब्रह्मचर्यमकल्कता। एतानि मानसान्याहुर्व्रतानि हरितुष्टये ॥ एकभुक्तं तथा नक्तमुपवासमयाचितम् । इत्येवं कायिकं पुंसां व्रतमुक्तं नरेश्वर ॥ वेदस्याध्ययनं विष्णोः कीर्तनं सत्यभाषण्म्। अपैशुन्यमिदं राजन् वाचिकं व्रतमुच्यते॥ पद्म IV. 84, 42-44, वराह 37. 4-6 ( with slight variation); हेमाद्रि(on व्रत) I. p. 321 quotes the first two verses from वराहपुराण and reads अकल्मषं for अकल्कता and उपवासादिकं च यत् in the 2nd verse. अकल्कता is explained as अकुबिलता by the मिता. on या. III. 312 and as दम्भरहितता by अपरार्क.

Classifications of vratas

It is therefore that Hemādri begins his treatment of individual vratas with tithi-vratas (from part I, p. 335 to part II p. 519) and passes on in order to vāravratas (part II pp. 520-592), nakśatravratas (part II pp. 593–706), Yogavratas (part II pp. 707-717), Karaṇa vratas (part II pp. 718–726), Saṅkrāntivratas (part II pp. 727 743), māsavratas (part II pp. 800-857), ṛtuvratas (part II pp. 858-861 ), saṃvatsaravratas (part II pp. 862-867), prakırṇaka (miscellaneous) vratas (part II pp. 867-1002). The Kr̥tyakalpataru (on vrata) on the other hand begins with vāravratas (pp. 8-34), then deals with tithivratas (pp. 35-398), nakśatra vratas (pp. 399-417), māsavratas (pp. 418-430), sankrāntivratas (pp. 431-434), samvatsaravratas (pp. 434-451) and prakirṇavratas (pp. 452-459). Most of the works on vrata[^142a] after dealing with some general matters begin their treatment of vratas with tithivratas. The Samayapradīpa has a different mode of treatment, viz. that it begins with Gaṇeśavratas (i.e. vratas in which Gaṇeśa is the deity), then with vratas in which the Sun is the deity, then Śivavratas, Viṣṇuvratas and so on. Some vratas are performed not only on a certain tithi, but also require the existence of a certain month or weekday or nakśatra or all of these. Another classification may be based on the persons competent to perform vratas; most vratas are meant for all men and women; some like Haritālikā and Vaṭasāvitri are meant for women alone, some are to be performed by men alone; while there are others to be performed only by kings or kṣatriyas or by vaiśyas.

There is an immense literature on vratas. There is no topic of Dharmaśāstra except probably that of tirthayātrā and of śrāddha on which the Purāṇas wax so eloquent as on vrata. Some of the Purāṇas contain thousands of verses on vrata. For oxample, the Brāhmaparya of the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa (in chapters 16-216) contains over 7500 verses and the Uttarakhaṇḍa of the same Purāṇa over five thousand verses on vratas; the Matsyapurāṇa (chapters 54–92 and 95–101) has about 1230 verses on vrata (most of which occur in the Padmapurāṇa V chap. 20 ff), the Varāhapurāṇa (chap. 39-65) spends about 700 verses and the Viśṇudharmottara about 1600 verses on vratas. On a modest calculation the Purāṇas contain about twenty-five thousand verses at least on vratas. It is difficult to draw a strict line between Vratas and utsavas; what are called utsavas have also an element of religious rites and conversely many vratas have some element of being a festival.

[^142a]: अथ संवत्सरकृत्ये निरूपणीये प्रायशः कर्माधिकरणतया विहितानां तिथीनां प्राधाम्यात् । प्रथमं तावत्तिथिस्वरूपनिरूपणपूर्वक कर्मोपयुक्तभागा निरूप्यन्ते । व .क्रि.कौ.p.2

H. D. 8





In this work I have included several observances which some people may regard as purely utsavas and not vratas at all.

The topic of vratas is rather inextricably mixed up with discussions on Kāla and tithi. The nibandhas (commentaries and digests) on vratas are numerous. In this section I shall mention works that deal with vratas alone or with vratas in relation to tithis, but not works on kāla in general and muhūrta. This is rather an arbitrary arrangement and it is possible that there would be some repetition and overlapping. A verse in the Kālaviveka of Jimūtavāhana names seven predecessors that had expounded kāla in relation to religious rites, viz. Jitendriya, Śaṅkhadhara, Andhūka, Sambhrama, Harivaṃśa and Yogloka. Some of these writers must have been earlier than the first half of the 11th century A. D. as in the Malamāsatattva Raghu nandana states that Andhūkabhatta mentions in his work how in _śake_ 955 (1033–34 A. D.) there was on Amāvāsyā Tulāsankrānti and the Vṛścikasaṇkrānti on the pratipad and again on Amāvāsyā Dhanus-saṇkrānti. This establishes that Andhūka bhatta wrote his works about 1035 A. D. But the works of all those seven writers on kāla have not yet been discovered. Two other works ascribed to king Bhoja of Dhārā[^143] dealt among other matters with kāla and vratas (in the 2nd quarter of the 11th century). One of them, the Rājamārtaṇḍa, is available in Mss and, besides expounding the astrological significance of tithis, week days, nakṣatras, Yogas, deals (in verses 1136–1292 and 1327-1405) with several vratas and the proper times for them - viz. Ekādaśī, Saptamyarkavrata, Agastyārghyadāna, Sravana dvādaśī, Rohinyaṣtamī, Haritāli-caturthi, Durgotsava, Kaujāgara, Pretacaturdaśi, Sukharātri, Bhrātṛ-dyitīyā, Dipadāna, Kārtikasnāna, Māghasnāna, Maghāsaptami, Bhismāstamī, Pusyadvādaśī, Asokāstamı, Caitrāvali, Savitrivrata, Pāṣāṇacaturthi, Araṇyaṣasthi, Daśaharā, Saṅkranti. The Rājamārtaṇḍa has not so far as I know yet been published, though hundreds of verses therefrom aro quoted in the medieval digests. It is at present the earliest extant work of a nibandha form treating of vratas. Another work dealing with vratas and ascribed to Bhoja is the one cited as Bhūpāla-samuccaya or Bhūpāla-kṛtyasamuccaya, or Kṛtyasamuccaya on _vratas_, _danas_ &c.

[^143]: Vide my paper on 'King Bhoja and his works on Dharmaśāstra and Astrology' in the Journal of Oriental Research, Madras, vol. XXIII pp. 94-127, where I deal with the Rājamārtaṇḍa on pp. 108-118 and with Bhūpālakṛtyasamuccaya on pp. 124-126.



Works on vrata relied on

This last work has not yet been unearthed and is found quoted in such medieval digests as the Kr̥tyaratnākara.

Apart from the Vedic Literature, sūtras, epics, Purāṇas and Rājamārtaṇḍa, I mainly rely in this section on vratas on the following works (those that I consulted in ms. form being expressly indicated and the works being arranged in chrono logical order as far as possible): Kr̥tyakalpataru ( portion on vratas) of Lakṣmidhara; Kālaviveka of Jīmūtavāhana; Hemādri's Caturvargacintāmaṇi (on vrata); Samayapradīpa of Srīdatta (ms.); Kr̥tyaratnākara of Caṇḍeśvara; Kālādarśa of Adityasūri (ms.), Kālanirṇaya or Kāla-mādhava and Kāla. nirṇayakārikā; Tithiviveka, Vratakālaviveka and Durgotsavaviveka of Sūlapāni; Nirṇayāmrta of Allādanātha; Varsakriyā. kaumudi of Govindānanda; Kālasāra of Gadādhara; the Tithi tattya, Ekādaśītattva, Janmāstamītattva, Durgārcanapaddhati, Kr̥tyatattva and Vratatattva of Raghunandana, Vrataprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya) of Mitramiśra (ms. from Anūpa Sanskrit Library) and Samayaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); Samayamayūkha or Kālamayūkha of Nīlakantha; Vratārka of Śaṅkarabhatta (ms.); Tithyarka of Divākara; Daśanirṇaya[^144] of Hārīta Venkatanātha; Vratodyāpana-kaumudi of Śaṅkarabhatta Ghāre; Vratarāja of Viśvanātha; Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi of Viśṇubhatta; Ahalyā-kāmadhenu (ms. in Scindia Oriental Institute, 1767-1771 A.D.); Dharmasindhu of Kāśīnātha. Of these the most important for vratas are Kṛtyakalpataru (from which even Hemādri, and Kr̥tyaratnākara borrow many passages), Hemādri on vrata, Kālanirṇaya of Mādhava, Kṛtyaratnākara, Varśakriya kaumudi, the works of Raghunandana and the Nirṇaya-sindhu. Works like Vratārka and Vratarāja, though exhaustive, borrow _verbatim_ long passages from Hemādri and others. The treatment of vratas in several of the above-mentioned works is often uneven; for example, the Varśakriyākaumudi disposes of the observances of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd tithis in two pages (28-30), while it devotes twenty-two pages to Ekādaśi (pp. 42-64).

It must be emphasized here that this section is concerned with the vratas described or mentioned in works on _Dharmaśāstra_. Even so the number of vratas is extremely large.

[^144]: This was edited in 1902 _samvat_ in Grantha characters at Mysore. The ten निर्णयs are on श्रीकृष्णजयन्ती, कृत्तिकादीपोत्सव, उपाकर्म, {??},{??},विवाह्यकन्या, स्थालीपाक, भक्ष्याभक्ष्य, उत्सव, एकादशी.





No attempt is made here to include all _vratas_ observed by women or by primitive tribes or by the illiterate people all over India or contained in works written in the several regional languages such as Bengali, Hindi or Marathi. The inclusion of such observances would entail an enormous amount of labour, would expand the work to huge proportions and would be beyond the proper scope of the History of Dharmaśāstra. Further, to tabulate all the vratas and festivals of all common people and to study the folk life of villagers, forest-dwellers and mountain inhabitants in the States of the continent of India would be beyond the capacity of a single worker and would require the co-operative effort of a large team of workers spread over years. When done, that work would be a monumental one on the social anthropology of India. In this connection I may mention Prof. B. K. Sarkar's work 'Folk element in Hindu culture' and the paper on a study of vrata rites in Bengal' contributed by Mr. S. R. Das[^145] to 'Man in India' (1952) vol. 32, pp. 207-245. Some writers have already published works dealing with the observances of common people such as Mrs. Stevenson's 'Rites of the twice-born', Underhill's 'Hindu religious year', B. A. Gupte's Hindu holidays and ceremonials', R. C. Mukerj's Ancient Indian fasts and feasts', Mr. Rigvedi's Marathi work on 'History of Aryan festivals' (ed. of 1924). In these books (except in the last and rarely in Underhill's) texts from Dharmaśāstra are generally conspicuous by their absence.

_Times for beginning Vratas_: Apart from the vratas that have to be performed on certain fixed tithis or times, elaborate provisions are made that vratas in general and several other religious rites are to be begun only at certain auspicious times or in certain astrological conditions.

[^145]: It should not, however, be supposed that I agree with all the propositions in the above two; for example, the meaning wbich Mr. S. R. Das assigns to Lakṣmī in Ṛg. X. 71. 2 (viz. beauty) is not acceptable to me. I hold that 'Lakśmī' there also is the opposite of _alakśmī_- as the word 'bhadrā' applied to Lakṣmī suggests and as in Ṛg. X. 155. 1 the idea of alakśmī is clearly conveyed. I do not subscribe to the view that the idea of a malignant spirit was unknown to the poets of Ṛgveda times and that they had to go to the aboriginal people for that idea. Note the verses अत्रा सखायः सख्यानि जानते <u>भद्रैषां लक्ष्मीर्निहिताधि</u> वाचि॥ ऋ. x. 71. 2; अरायि काणे विकटे गिरिं गच्छ सदान्वे। शिरिम्षठस्य सत्वभिस्तेभिष्ट्वा चातयामसि॥ ऋ. X. 155 1. The निरुक्त (VI. 30) explains this verse at length and states that Bhāradvāja destroyed Alakśmī and the Bṛhad-devatā (VIII, 60) says that Ṛg. X. 71 removes Alakśmī.

Proper times for vratas

A few of these are set out here by way of sample. Gārgya[^146] says 'when Jupiter and Venus have set (i. e. are not observable owing to their being near the Sun in the sky) or when they are in the stage of being called _bāla_ and _vṛddha_ and in an intercalary month one should not begin a vrata nor perform its _udyāpana_ (the rite of closing a vrata).' The childhood of Jupiter and Venus is a certain period after they set and senility (_vṛddhatva or vārdhaka_) is a certain period preceding their setting. There is no unanimity on the length of these periods and the periods differ in different countries and also depend on whether there is a season of distress or difficulty, but Varāhamihira[^147] states the longest provided should be accepted. The Rājamārtaṇḍa has several verses on this, one of which may be set out here: Venus[^148] is _bāla_ for ten days when it rises in the west, but is _bāla_ for three days after rising in the east; Venus is vṛddha for one pakṣa. (15 days) when it rises in the east, but is _vṛddha_ for five days before it sets in the west. Gargya observes :[^149] Venus and Jupiter are (held to be bāla) in the Vindhyas whether in the east or west for ten days, but for seven days in the country of Avanti (of which Ujjayinī was capital); in the country of Vaṇga (Bengal) and among Hūṇas (they are bāla) respectively for six and five days. It is further provided in the[^150] Devipurāṇa that one should not undertake any religious act when Jupiter or Venus is in the sign of the Lion.

Similarly, Lalla[^151] remarks that all (religious) actions are condemned when done in what is called Gurvāditya (that is when the sun is in the house of Jupiter viz. sign of Pisces and when Jupiter is in the house of the Sun, viz. Lion). The Vratarāja remarks that one is to avoid Jupiter in the Lion sign for religious acts only to the north of the Narmadā and elsewhere only in Simhāṃśa (i.e. the first quarter of the naksatra Pūrvā-phalguni). The Ratnamālā[^152] provides that Monday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are auspicious (confer success) in all (religious) acts; but on Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday only such actions succeed as are expressly prescribed for performance on those days, Bhujabala remarks that Tuesday is unfavourable for all auspicious acts but that it is commended for agriculture, study (of the Sāmaveda) and for battles[^153].

The philosophical discussions on Time and on its division into year, _ayana_ (the Sun's apparent motion in the two regions of the celestial sphere), _ṛtus_ (seasons), māsa (month), pakṣa (half month,) week, days &c. will be taken up in the next section. But the exact determination of the question as to the day on which a _tithivrata_ is to be performed when the _tithi_ spreads over two days occupies a very large space in works on dharmaśāstra.

The word _tithi_ by itself does not occur in the Ṛgveda and the other Vedic Saṃhitās. But the idea must have been there even in the Ṛgveda. Amāvāsyā is explained in later works as being of two kinds, viz. Sinīvāli (day on which amāvāsyā is mixed with the 14th tithi) and Kuhū (when amāvāsyā is mixed with the first tithi of the next fortnight). Similarly, Paurṇamāsi is of two kinds, Anumati (mixed with the 14th tithi) and Rākā (mixed with the _Pratipad_ of the next pakṣa). In the Ṛgveda Sinivāli is[^154] raised to the position of a divinity, is described as the sister of the gods, offerings are made to her and she is implored to bestow progeny on the worshippers.

_Sinivāli, Kuhū, Rākā, Anumati_

63

The Br. Up. VI. 4. 21 implores Sinivāli and the Aśvins to implant an embryo in the wife. Rākā also[^155] is similarly treated in the Ṛgveda (II. 32. 4-5 = Atharva VII. 48. 1-2). Ṛg. X. 59.6 and X. 167. 3 treat Anumati as a deity, prayers are offered to her to enable the worshippers to see the Sun going up and to bestow happiness and she is spoken of in the same breath with Soma, Varuna and Brhaspati. The Vāj. S. prays[^156] 'May Anumati approve to-day of our sacrifice'. It should be noted that the Nirukta (XI. 29) holds[^157] a discussion on Anumati and Rākā, viz. the Nairuktas (etymologists) say that Anumati and Rākā are goddesses (wives of gods), while the Yājñikas hold that they are two kinds of Paurṇamāsī; it is known (in Sruti) that the first Paurnamāṣi is Anumati and the later is Rākā. Similarly, the Nirukta holds a discussion on Sinivāli and Kuhū (XI, 31). The Atharvaveda (VI. 11. 3) mentions Prajāpati, Anumati and Sinivāli together. The word Kuhū occurs in the Atharvaveda and is applied to a deity that is invoked to come to the sacrifice and to bestow on the worshipper wealth and a heroic son. In the Tai. S. I. 8. 8.1 and Sat. Br. IX. 5. 1. 38 mention is made of these four, viz. of Anumati, Rākā, Sinīvāli and Kuhū, as recipients of _caru_ (oblation of boiled rice). How these names were coined in the distant past is an insoluble riddle. Anumati can be derived from root _man_, but why the tithi of the Full Moon mixed with the 14th tithi was so called is more than anyone can say. Kuhū may be plausibly derived from _kuha_ 'where' (as in Ṛg. I. 24. 10, X. 40. 2) as the day when the moon is invisible and when primitive people asked in wonder the question 'where does the moon go' But Rākā and Sinivāli defy attempts at any plausible etymology.

It may be noted that the words या पूर्वा... राका occur in the मैत्रायणीसंहिता IV, 3.5 and in the ऐ. व्रा. 32.9 which latter is quoted in note 165.





Eminent philologists, instead of admitting ignorance, are not wanting, who following the traditions of the very ancient etymologist Yāska (who says in Nirukta II. 1 _'na tveva na nirbrūyā_), suggest that the word Sinīvāli is made up by combining the Babylonian-Akkadian word "sin' (meaning moon) with Dravidian 'vel' (white light)[^158]. 'Amāyāsyā' (New Moon) is addressed as a deity by itself in Atharva[^159] VII. 79 (84) 1-4, the first of which calls upon Amāvāsyā to come to the sacrifice and bestow wealth and a valiant son and the second of which hints at the derivation of the word from 'amā' (meaning together' or 'home') and _'vas'_ (to dwell). The Śat. Br.[^160] remarks "this king Soma i.e. the moon is the food of the gods; when he (the moon) is not seen on this night either in the east or in the west, he comes to this world (i.e. the earth) and enters the waters and the herbs here; he is the wealth of the gods and their food; when he dwells on this night together (with waters and herbs) it (that night) there fore is called 'Amāvāsyā'. The Ait. Br. (40.5) states that on amāvāsyā the moon enters the sun. The Āp. Dh. S. also echoes this idea that on the Amāyāsyā night the Sun and the Moon dwell together (are near each other). So amāvāsyā is so called either because the moon was supposed to dwell together with waters and herbs on the earth that night or because the Moon dwells in the Sun on that night. Darśa has the same sense as amāvāsyā, and means the day on which the moon is seen by the sun alone (and by no one else)'. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1009 and note 2274. Names are sometimes given by contraries e.g. a fool is called a wise man or a brave person may be called 'timid'. Amāyāsyā may have been called darśa because the moon is not seen that day (but would be visible the next day).

[^158]: Vide 'Bhāratakaumudi' (in honour of Prof. R. K. Mukerji) part I. p. 208 for this etymology put forward by Dr. S. K. Chatterji. Such etymologies are based on certain assumptions for which there is absolutely no evidence whatever, such as the word Vel' being used by the Dravidians thousands of years ago, that the vedic Indians were aware of both words "Sin' (moon) and 'Vel' used by different peoples and could weld them together thousands of years ago and had no word of their own to denote what is meant by Sinivālī.

Tithis in Vedic Literature

65



 Another tithi that is famous in the Vedic Literature is Asṭakā[^161] (8th tithi after the full moon in any month, but particularly in Māgha) on which offerings were made to the pitṛs (departed ancestors). Even in very remote times people could have easily marked the four main phases of the moon, viz. Full Moon, half moon (8th day there after when half of the moon's orb shines), Moon's total absence and 8th day thereafter; and after noting these phases it must not have been very difficult to make close calculations about the periods intervening between the Full moon and the half moon, the New moon and half moon. As a matter of fact the Tai. Br.[^162] expressly says that the moon is worn away on the 15th and becomes full on the 15th i.e. before the Tai. Br. it was wellknown that there were 30 lunar days (tithis) in a lunar month. It is stated in the Sat. Br.[^163] "the joints of Prajāpati, while he was engaged in creating beings, became loose (or collapsed); the saṃvatsara is indeed Prajapati and the joints of it (of samvatsara) are the two junctions of day and night, Paurṇamāsı, Amāyāsyā and the beginnings (first days) of the seasons'. The words Paurṇamāsī and Amāvāsyā occur very frequently in the Atharvaveda, the Tai. S. and other Vedic texts, though the two words do not occur in the Ṛgveda. The Atharvaveda says[^164] that Paurṇamāsi was the first among days and nights and was worthy of sacrifice.

[ Sec. I, Ch. III

The Ait. Br. 165 has an interesting passage: "they (wise men) say that when a sacrificer dwells near his sacrificial fire, that is due to his thought that the gods will partake of his offerings, since they do not eat the offering of a sacrificer who does not abide by certain observances'. The opinion of the sage Paiṅgi is that the sacrificer should stay near his sacrificial fires (or fast) on the previous Paurṇamāsī (i. e. Paurṇamāsī mixed with 14th), while the opinion of Kausītaki is that he should do so on the later one (i. e. the Paurṇamāsi mixed with _pratipad_). The previous Paurṇamāsī is called Anumati, the later one is called Rākā, while the previous Amāvāsyā is called Sinivāli and the later one is called Kuhū. That is the tithi (on which a religious rite should be performed), it is the one, being associated with which the sun sets and the sun rises.” This passage shows that differences of opinion had arisen long before the time of the Ait. Br. as to on what day a particular rite associated with a certain fixed tithi was to be performed when the tithi was spread over two days. There are references in Tai. S. and the Brāhmaṇa literature which show that in those ancient days the duration of tithis and therefore the actual position of the moon could not sometimes be very accurately determined beforehand. A man about to perform an iṣti on New Moon (_darśeṣtı_) does certain acts that are done on the day previous to amāvāsyā such as using the sour curds from last night's milking for coagulating the sacri ficial food (i.e. milk), separating the calves from the cows in the afternoon with a _palāśa_ twig; and taking some husked rice, he thinks, owing to cloudy weather or through miscalculation, that the moon would not be seen in the sky the next morning, does not actually set apart a few handfuls of husked rice (meant as _nirvāpa_ for the gods) or gets them apart, then the next day the moon is seen in the sky (i.e. the next day is really 14th tithi instead of amāvāsyā). It is then prescribed that he has to perform an expiatory rite called Abhyuditeṣṭi.


[^165]: तदाहुर्यदर्शपूर्णमासयोरुपवसति न ह वा अव्रतस्य देवा हविरश्नन्ति तस्मादुपवसत्युत मे देवा अश्नीयुरिति। पूर्वी पौर्णमासीमुपवसेदिति पैङ्यमुत्तरामिति कौषीतकं या पूर्वा पौर्णमासी सानुमतिर्योत्तरा सा राका। या पूर्वामावास्या सा सिनीवाली योत्तरा सा कुहूः । यां पर्यस्तमियादभ्युदियादिति सा तिथिः। ऐ.व्रा. 32. 9. It may be remembered that Sāyaṇa notes that this section (khaṇḍa) and the next are not recited and are not therefore explained by them. The last sentence probably means that that is the tithi ( on which a specific religious act is to be performed) with reference to which the sun sets or with reference to which it rises i.e. these words embody in a somewhat obscure form the same idea to which Devala gives expression in the following two verses: यां तिथिं समनुप्रप्य अस्तं याति दिवाकरः । सा तिथिः सकला ज्ञेया स्नानदानजपादिषु। यां तिथिं समनुप्राप्य उदयं याति भास्करः। सा तिथिः सकला ज्ञेया दानाध्ययनकर्मसु॥ quoted by अपरार्क p. 211. In व.क्रि.कौ. p. 15 and व्र. का. वि. p. 233 the second half of both verses is the same viz. सा ... स्नानदानजपादिषु and यां तिथिं ... अस्तं याति दिवाकरः। ... ज्ञेया दानाध्ययनकर्मसु॥ 1 METUS II. As observed by व.क्रि.कौ. Devala means that in स्नान्, दान् and व्रत the tithi at sunrise is to be preferred.



Word tithi in ancient Literature

67

Vide Tai. S. II. 5.5.1-2 and Śat. Br. XI. 1. 4.1-2 quoted[^166] below. The word tithi does not occur in the Samhitās, but it occurs in the Ait. Br. cited above and in the gṛhya and dharma sūtras.

The Gobhilagrhyasūtra[^167] when prescribing a day for the setting up of sacred fires mentions the coincidence of an auspicious _tithi_ and _nakṣatra_ and in another place refers to the worship of the lord of the tithi and of the nakṣatra and of the tithi itself. The Kausītaki-gṛhya (I. 25) speaks of offerings to the tithi on which a child was born and prescribes that the dedication of ponds, wells and tanks was to be made in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious tithi (V.2).

The Nirukta[^168] while deriving the word _atithi_ applied to Agni in Ṛg. V. 4.5 gives two explanations, one of which is 'one who approaches the houses of others on special _tithis_'. Pāṇini furnishes no sūtra relating to the word _tithi_, but it is possible to argue that the affix _titha_ which he mentions in explaining words like 'bahutitha '[^169] was a relic of the word tithi. Patañjali expressly mentioned Paurṇamāsi tithi. Vide ‘India Antiqua', the volume of studies presented to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel pp. 109-112 for Prof. Edgerton's paper on affix 'titha'. From the above discussion it would be clear that the ideas and divergences of views about the proper tithis for certain religious acts existed in the Vedic times (at least before Ait. Br.) three thousand years ago and that the word _tithi_ itself must be held to have been in use about 800 B. C., if not earlier still.[^170]

Tithi is defined as the time or period required by the moon to gain twelve degrees on the sun. As the Sūryasiddhānta states "tithi is the lunar day in which the moon leaving the sun (at the last moment of Amāvāsyā), traverses twelve degrees (_bhāgas_) towards the east every day.'[^171] The moon's motion is irregular and therefore the moon traverses twelve degrees sometimes in 60 ghaṭikās, sometimes in more (up to about 65) and sometimes in less ghaṭikās up to about 54. The result is that one unit day may be co-terminous with one tithi, but often a unit day has two tithis i.e. in the morning it may be the 6th tithi, but in the afternoon, evening and night it may be the 7th. It is possible that in a single civil day (from sunrise to sunrise) there may be three tithis e.g. on Monday morning there may be only two ghaṭikās left of the 6th tithi, then the 7th tithi may be only 56 ghaṭikās in duration and then the 8th may follow for the last two ghaṭikās of that unit day. Conversely, a single tithi may touch three days. For example, the last two ghaṭikās of Monday may be the first two ghaṭikās of the 6th tithi, then the 60 ghaṭikās of Tuesday may be occupied by the 6th tithi and two more ghaṭikās (the last) of the 6th tithi may spread on to Wednesday morning. A unit day which spreads over three tithis is declared by the Rājamārtaṇḍa to be very holy[^172] (or auspicious); while on the other hand a tithi touching three days is said to be inauspicious for marriage, for marching on an invasion, for an auspicious religious act or an act meant to advance prosperity.[^173]

_Tithi-vṛddhi and tithi-kṣaya explained_

 If a tithi begins immediately before sunrise or its beginning coincides with sunrise and ends after the following sunrise the name of the tithi (as pratipad, dvitīyā or so on as the case may be) is coupled with both divasas (civil days) involved, so that two tithis of the same denomination appear one after another. This is called vṛddhi of the particular tithi. If a tithi begins sometime after sunrise on one morning and ends before sunrise on the following day it cannot be coupled with any day and is therefore deleted or omitted in the pañcāṅga (almanac) and there is _tithi-kṣaya_. As a tithi is normally shorter than the civil day kṣaya occurs more frequently than _vṛddhi_.

From the words of the Gobhilagṛhya quoted above it follows that long before the days of that work the several tithis were deemed to have certain deities as their lords (or presiding deities). Among the earliest extant enumerations about _tithipatis_ (lords of tithis) is that in the Bṛhatsamhitā of Varāhamihira (chap. 98. 1-2) which sets them[^174] out as follows (the tithis and their lords being mentioned in order):-1st Brahmā, 2nd Brahmā, 3rd Hari, 4th Yama, 5th the moon, 6th Kārtikeya, 7th Indra, 8th Vasus, 9th Nāgas, 10th Dharma, 11th Śiva, 12th Savitṛ, 13th Madana, 14th Kali, 15th Viśvedevas and of Amāyāsyā the pitṛs. He further says that one should do on those tithis the acts that are appropriate to the lords of those tithis. It appears that other writers differed somewhat from Varāhamihira, e.g. the Ratnamālā sets[^175] out the lords of tithis according to the Purāṇas as follows:-1st Agni, 2nd Brahmā, 3rd Girijā, 4th Gaṇeśa, 5th Nāga, 6th Viśākha (Skanda), 7th the Sun, 8th Śiva, 9th Durgā, 10th Yama, 11th Viṣṇu, 12th Hari, 13th Madana, 14th Śiva, 15th the Moon.

(on व्रत) II, p. 235 quotes from विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 83. 22–24 'अग्नि-ब्रह्माम्बिकेभास्य-नाग-स्कन्द-विरोचनाः। शिव-दुर्गा-यमेन्द्राश्च विष्णु काम-शिवेन्दुकाः ॥ पितरश्चेत्यमी प्रोक्ता मुनिभिस्तिथिदेवताः।। हे. (on काल) p. 646 quotes from पितामह the lords of तिथिs somewhat differently as धनद, श्री, भवानी, गणेश, नाग, गुह, भास्कर, दुर्गा, मातरः, वासुकि, ऋषि, चक्रपाणि, कमदेव, शिव, धातृ respectively of 1st to 15th, अमावास्या being पित्र्य.




The Skandapurāṇa (I. 1. 33. 78-82) states what tithis are specially dear to what gods such as 8th and 14th to Śiva, 4th to Gaṇeśa, 9th to Canḍikā. The Garuḍa (I. 137. 16-19 ) and Nārada-purāṇa (I. 56. 133–135) specify what deities are to be worshipped on the tithis from the first to 15th.

Varāhamihira divides tithis into five[^176] groups, viz. Nandā, Bhadrā, Vijayā or Jayā, Riktā and Pūrṇā and states that on those tithis the acts that are appropriate or suited to the lords of the tithis should be done and become crowned with success and the fruits of actions done on these five classes of tithis yield results similar to their names. The same applies to _karaṇas_ and _muhūrtas_. The result is Nandā tithis are 1st, 6th, 11th; Bhadrās are 2nd, 7th, 12th; Vijayās 3rd, 8th, 13th; Riktās are 4th, 9th and 14th; Pūrṇās are 5th, 10th, 15th. This is also brought out in the Atharvaṇa Jyotiṣa, which also prescribes what should be done or not done on the tithis from the 1st to the 15th and provides that certain combinations of tithis and certain weekdays yield success and all rewards, viz. Nandā tithi on Friday, Bhadrā on Wednesday, Jayā on Tuesday, Riktā on Saturday, and Pūrṇā on Thursday.

The Tithitattva (pp. 27-28) quotes a long passage specifying the loss a man suffers by eating fifteen specified things from the 1st to the 15th tithi respectively. The Nirṇayasindhu (p. 32) quotes verses from Muhūrta-dīpikā and Bhūpāla[^177] (i.e. Bhoja) which specify the edibles and certain actions that are respectively to be given up on the tithis from the first to the 15th and on amāvāsyā. On the other hand, Bhaviṣyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva 16. 18-20) quoted by the Kalpataru on vrata p. 35 specially recommends the eating of certain things on each of the 15 tithis from _pratipad_ (the first) viz. milk, flowers (on 2nd), anything except salt (on 3rd), sesame, milk, fruits, vegetables (on 7th and 8th), flour, food uncooked by fire, ghee (on 11th), pāyasa (rice boiled in milk), cow's urine, _yavas_, water in which kuśas have been dipped.

The तिथितस्व (pp. 27-28) details the results of what follows from eating the forbidden fruits &c. on the respective tithis specified.

Eatables and actions fit for tithis

11

The Vāmanapurāṇa[^178] (14. 48–51) prescribes what actions should not be done on the groups of tithis called Nandā &c., on certain week days and on certain nakṣatras.

The method of reckoning time by tithis is a very early one and is indigenous to India. Though Western scholars have from time to time put forward various theories about the so-called Greek influence on Indian astronomy and astrology and about the Indian Naksatra system being borrowed from the Chinese (Biot) or from the Babylonians (Weber ) or from the Arabs (Sedillot), no western scholar has had the courage, so far as I know, of alleging that the system of tithis is not indigenous but is borrowed from some non-Indian source. The theories about Greek influence will be briefly dealt with in the next section.

Vedic (and Smr̥ti) injunctions are of two kinds, (1) those that urge a person to do a thing such as 'one should fast on Ekādaśi in both pakṣas', (2) those that dissuade a person from doing something as in 'one should not eat food on Ekādaśī', Tithis are thus an _aṅga_ of the two kinds of injunctions. According to Garga,[^179] tithi, nakṣatra and vāra (week day) are a means of puṇya (merit) and pāpa (demerit, sin) by being subsidiary to the principal rite prescribed, but they are not able to produce the above result independently[^180].

[  

_Tithi_ is of two kinds, [^181] _pūrṇā_ (complete or full) and _sakhaṇḍā_. When a single tithi covers the whole day from sunrise for sixty nāḍikās (or ghaṭikās) the tithi is pūrṇā, i.e. the tithi begins exactly at sunrise and ends with the next sunrise and is exactly 60 ghaṭikās in extent. All others than this are sakhaṇḍa; these latter again are of two kinds śuddhā and viddhā (pierced by or intermixed with another)[^182]. A śuddhā tithi is one that extends from sunrise to sunset or (in the case of some tithis like śivarātri) up till midnight; other sakhaṇḍa tithis are called _viddhā_. _Vedha_ is of two kinds, morning vedha and evening vedha; the former generally occurs when after six ghaṭikās from sunrise a tithi touches or gets merged with the next tithi, while the latter (evening vedha) generally occurs when a tithi touches another tithi six ghaṭikās before sunset. In the case of certain tithis the period prescribed may exceed six ghaṭikās.

When the tithi in question is 60 ghaṭikās in extent and begins with sunrise (i. e. when it is pūrṇā) there is no difficulty at all. When a tithi is śuddhā in the sense given by the Dharmasindhu then also there is generally no difficulty. Some general rules have to be kept in mind. Śruti says[^183] 'forenoon is for the gods, midday for men and afternoon for pitṛs'. Manu (IV. 152) says: one should carry out morning duties, decorating the body, bath, brushing the teeth, applying collyrium to the eyes and worship of gods in forenoon alone'. Therefore all religious acts prescribed for being performed by day on certain tithis for gods must be begun in the morning even if the tithi is mixed with another on that day, but all vratas to be performed in the evening or night have to be performed on the tithi existing in the evening or night even[^184] though it may be mixed up (viddhā) with another tithi. Another matter to be noted is that in both halves of the month all tithis may affect the previous tithi and following tithi by three muhūrtas (i. e. six nāḍis or ghaṭikās)[^185].

__181. Some works do not make this elaborate division of tithi found in Dbarmasindhu, Tbe Nirṇayasindbu speaks of only saddbā and viddha; 80 the Tithyarka also speaks of only two सम्पूर्णा and खण्डा. संपूर्णोक्ता स्कन्दपुराने प्रतिपत्मभूतयः सर्वा उदयादोयादगाइः । सम्पूर्णा इति विख्याता हरिवासारजिताइलि सालित II. p. 357, तिश्यर्क p. 3.

All religious acts to be done at right time

73

Some tithis produce vedha by a larger number of ghaṭikas e. g. the 5th makes sasthi affected by twelve nādis, 10th makes 11th viddhā by 15 nādis, &c. Viddhā tithis are in some cases fit for performing religious acts, sometimes they are not. All rites 186 of the śrauta or smārta type, vrata, dāṇa and every other act enjoined by the Veda do not yield proper reward as long as there is no determination of the tithi proper for it. That tithi which covers up the time (such as morning), noon, whole day &c. at which a religious act is prescribed to be done is the proper one for 187 that act. The first principle to 188 remember is that Kāla (the time prescribed for a rite) is not a mere detail, but it is a nimitta (an occasion) on the happening of which a rite is to be performed and that therefore what is done at some time other than the prescribed one is practically as good as not done. There is a text of the Tai. S. II. 2. 5. 4 which indicates this principle about Kāla. It says 'that man is cut off from the heavenly world, who desiring to perform the darśa pūrpamāsa rites transgresses the time of full Moon or Now Moon'. Hemādri 189 strongly emphasizes the performance of rites

on the proper time and states that a gaupakāla is resorted to for escaping from the censure of śistas or for the solace of one's mind or because there is no other alternative. If a tithi can be had on two days and at the required time or if it does not exist on both days at the time required or it extends only up to a part of the time for which it is required, then the decision is arrived at, as a general rule, by what is called 'yugmavākya' to be cited below. 190 Suppose, for example, that a vrata is to be performed at noon on a certain tithi, then that tithi may exist at noon on two days or suppose that the tithi begins one or two ghaṭikās after noon and ends on the next day one or two ghaṭikās before noon, then the decision as to which tithi (whether pūrva-viddhā or para-viddhā) is proper for the act would have to be decided as a general rule by the Yugmavākya. The Yugmavākya may be translated as follows: "The pairs (or combinations) of the following tithis lead to great reward, viz. of the 2nd and 3rd tithis, of the 4th and 5th, of the 6th and 7th, of the 8th and 9th, of the 11th and 12th, of the 14th with pūrpimā (Full moon tithi) and of Amāvāsya with the 1st: the reverse (i. e, combinations or pairs of other tithis) results in great loss; such combinations destroy all former (accumulated) merit. In these verses there are seven pairs and they are mutually applicable. The question may be asked: on what tithi a vrata prescribed for the 2nd tithi should be performed if the 2nd is combined with the first on one day (that is, it is pūrvaviddhā) and is also combined with the 3rd on the next day (i. e. it is para viddhā). The reply is: as a general rule the day on which the 2nd is combined with the 3rd tithi should be the proper one for the dvitiyāvrata and not the day on which 2nd tithi is combined with the first. Similarly, in the case of a vrata to be performed on tṛtīyā, if the 3rd tithi occurs on one civil day combined with the 2nd and on the next day it is combined with the 4th, then the proper day as a general rule for a trtīyā-vrata is the one on which the 2nd and 3rd tithis are in combination and not the other day on which the 3rd and 4th tithis combine. The result of this passage is that combinations of 1st and 2nd tithi, of the 3rd and 4th, of 5th and 6th, of 7th and 8th, of the 9th and 10th, of the 10th and 11th, of 12th and

Some say that these rules apply only to tithis of the bright half and not to those of the dark half. But many works such as Aparārka (p. 216), Kalanirṇaya (p. 172), Vratakālaviveka (P.O. vol. VII. p. 87), Nirṇayasindhu (p. 18) hold that the passage applies to tithis of the dark half also, since the express mention of Amāvāsyā in combination with pratipad is an indication in that direction. It would be noticed that the yugmavākya (oven though held to be applicable to the dark half) does not refer to the first tithi of the dark half, the 10th and 13th tithis of both halves. Their combinations with the preceding or following tithis will be governed by express texts where available and by other considerations in other cases, such as the verse 'in the bright half that tithi should be preferred which exists at the time the sun rises and, in the dark half, that tithi should be preferred which exists when the sun sets.' 192 Another important rule is that where there are express texts prescribing a particular com bination of viddhā tithis as more appropriate for a vrata or other

The कालादर्श (folio 9a) ascribes the verses to पैठीनसि. They are the same as राजमार्तण्ड folio 69 band 70a, verses 1123-24 (ABORI vol. 36p 309). The समयमदीप (folio 7 b) explains these verses at great length and remarks 'अयं च युग्मादिविधिरहोरात्रसाध्योपवासादेकर्माण तिथिद्वैधे सति सर्वत्र मोद्धव्यः। देवपूजादावपि दिनद्वये विहितपूर्वाह्नादिगामितिथिलाभे सति । यदा त्वेकस्मिन्नेव दिवसे विहितकाललाभः तदा तत्रैव कर्म न तु व्यस्तनिन्दाश्रवणात्तत्रापि युग्मादरः ।'.

religious rite, that express rule prevails and not the rule derived from this yugmavākya.193 For example, it is laid down in the very place (where the yugmavākya occurs) that the 6th tithi, 8th tithi, amāvāsya and the 13th of the dark half are to be preferred (for religious rites) when in combination with the following tithis (i. e. 7th, 9th, 1st of bright half and 14th of dark half respectively) and others (than those mentioned in the first half such as the 7th, 9th) are to be preferred when combined with those preceding them.194 The application of special considera tions may be further illustrated by the following. The same tithi may be preferred if pārzaviddhā'in one vrata and as para viddhā in other cases owing to the difference in the deities of the vratas. For example, Skandaṣasthi is preferred as pūrvaviddhā, but Mandārasasthi is preferred as paraviddha (because the deity is Mandāra and not Skanda). Sometimes, although the devatā is the same, it will have to be pūrvaviddhā and sometimes paraviddhā as in the Vinayaka-vrata which requires mid-day as the proper time. If the 4th exists at midday and then is mixed up with 5th, but did not exist at midday the previous day, then 4th mixed with 5th will be preferred; but if mixed with the 3rd before noon and not mixed with 5th at time of midday, 4th mixed with third will be preferred. Sometimes it depends on the fact whether it is bright or dark fortnight. Sukla pratipad will be preferred if pūrvaviddhā, but kļṣṇa pratipad will be pre ferred as uttaraviddhā. The rites for pitrs are not governed by yugma-vākya. The gļhya-parisista provides that the pitss attend on that tithi which exists at the time when the sun sets ; that tithi and afternoon are assigned for the pitrs by Brahmā himself.195 Sometimes even a combination not approved by yugmavākya has to be accepted for the performance of a rite e. g. when astamī with Rohini naksatra exists (in Krṣnajanma vrata) the fast should be observed on that Astami, though it may be combined with 7th tithi (and not on 9th as yugmavākya

requires).1% Sometimes, even though a tithi be pūrṇā, it is passed over in favour of a viddhā one.191 Suppose there is Ekādaśī in the bright half from sunrise to sunrise on a certain day and there is Ekādaśī on the next day for two ghaṭikās, then there is Dvādaśī for 59 ghaṭikis in extent; thus trayodasi comm ences the day after just one ghaṭikā after sunrise. According to this verse of Pracetas there is to be no upavāsa on the Ekādaśī, though it is pārṇā, but the fast will be observed on Drādasi, and the pāraṇā in order to be celebrated on dvādaśī will have to be during the first ghaṭikā of the third day from ekādaśī or earlier. But if the Drādaśī in this case be only for 55 ghaṭikās, trayodaśī will begin three ghaṭikās before sunrise; if pāraṇā be done at sunrise it will be on the 13th and not on the 12th. In this latter case, according to Pracetas, the Upavāsa will have to be on the pūrṇā Ekādaśī in order that the piraṇā may be on 12th. It has to be further remembered that the positive prescrip tion about celebrating a vrata or the like on the fixed tithi is governed by the yugmavākya, but the rules forbidding the partaking of oil, meat or the like on the fixed tithi apply for the whole of that day198 and that tithi, whether it is 65 ghaṭikās and extends over three days or is only 55 ghaṭikās and extends over two days only. For explaining the words "eka dasyām nirāhāraḥ' from Varāha-purāṇa ( 39. 32 ) the Ekādaśī tattva (pp. 3-4) states that one is to fast not inerely for the time that the Ekādaśī lasts on a week-day but for the whole of the week day on which Ekadasi falls and it applies the reason ing contained in Jai. VI. 2. 19-20 (called Kalañjādhikarana). If the vrata is such that some items in it are to be done by day and some at night, then that vrata must be observed on that tithi which exists by day as well as at night and in such a case

the yugmavākya has no application. Vide p. 72 and note 184 above. In certain cases where the vrata has several iterns extend ing over the whole day or a large part of it, the tithi at the time of sunrise even if it be only for a ghaṭikā is declared by some texts to be sakalā (pārṇā ) for purposes of both gifts and vratas.199

The Kālā darśa propounds the strange 200 theory based on Gobhila's words that the shortening and lengthening of the tithis is due to the piety and sinfulness of men and divides tithis into khurra (of proper extent, 60 ghaṭikās), darpa (more extensive than 60ghaṭikās) and himsra or himsa (of lesser extent than 60 ghaṭikās). The Rajamzrtanda has the same 201 division and remarks that when the tithi is either kharva or darpa (and they are viddhā.) then a rite is to be done on the later tithi (the proper tithi joined to the next one) and in the case of the shorter tithi (if it is viddha) one should prefer the former (i. e. the day on which the proper tithi is joined to an earlier one).202 The Varsa

This is one of the cases where a tithi though kbandā according to strict astronomical rule is to be regarded as full (or sakala) for Dharma sastra purposes.

A general rule is stated in some works that when the full moon which is in the lunar mansion that gives the name to a month is in conjunction with Jupiter that tithi has the word mahā prefixed to it. For example, the Paurpimā of Kārtika would be called Mahikartiki if the Moon and Jupiter are both in the Kṛttikās (Pleiades) on that tithi. The Rāja mārtaṇḍa and Bhaviṣyapurāṇa provide that a bath on the Mahācaitrī and (on the remaining eleven paurnimās with prefix mahā) in certain holy places yields great rewards, viz. bath at Prayāga on Mahāmaghi, on Mahāphālguns in the Naimisa forest, on Mahācaitrī at Salagrāma, on Mahavaisakhi at Mahādvāra, on Mahājyaisthi at Purusottama, on Mahasādhi at Kanakhala, on Mahāśrāvani at Kedara, on Mahābhādri at Badarl, on Mahāśvini at Kubjāmra, on Mahākārtiki at Puskara, on Mahāmārgaśīrṣi at Kānyakubja, on Mahāpausi at Ayodhyā 203

There are long lists of actions forbidden on certain tithis. A few passages may be cited here. Devala 204 says 'on the 15th, the 14th and particularly on the 8th one should avoid oil, meat, sexual intercourse and the use of a razor.' The Nāradiya provides
