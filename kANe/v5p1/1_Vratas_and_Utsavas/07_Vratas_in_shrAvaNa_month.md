CHAPTER VII

Vratas called Nāgapañcami, Manasāpūjā,

Rakṣābandhana, Krṣṇajanmāṣṭami

In the month of Śrāvaṇa there are several important vratas, one of which is Nāgapañcami on the 5th of the bright half of Śrāvaṇa. The Nāgapañcami is observed in different ways in all parts of India. Some hold that, instead of Akṣayyatṛtiyā, Nāgapañcami is the one half auspicious day out of 3 1/2 most auspicious days in the year. The Bhaviṣyapurāṇa, Brāhmaparva (chapter 32 verses 1-39), expatiates on Nāgapañcami. Kr̥tyakalpataru (on vrata) pp. 87-90 and Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. pp. 557-560) quote several verses from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa. Briefly, the Bhaviṣya [^321] says: when men on the 5th bathe with milk the nāgas called Vāsuki, Takṣaka, Kāliya, Maṇibhadra, Airāvata, Dhṛtarāsṭra, Karkoṭaka and Dhanañjaya, these give _abhaya_ (freedom from danger) to their families. A legend is told (in Bhaviṣya I. 32) that Kadrū, mother of nāgas, laid a bet with her sister Vinatā about the colour of the tail of Indra's horse called Uccaiḥ-śravas, Kadrū asserting that the tail was black though the horse was white and Vinatā saying that the body and tail were white and when the nāgas refused to practise the deceit whereby they were to become the dark hair in the horse's tail, Kadrū cursed them that fire would burn them in the _sarpasattra_ of Janamejaya). Persons should make golden, silver or clay images of nāgas, should worship them with Karavira and Jāti flowers and incense etc., feed brāhmaṇas with ghee, _pāyasa_ etc. and should bathe nāgas with milk. The result would be that nāgas would bestow on the worshippers safety (from snake-bite). The Bhaviṣyottarapurāṇa (chap. 36) contains another method. On Śrāvaṇa 5th (bright half) a person should draw on both sides of his door with cowdung figures of serpents which should be worshipped with curds, dūrvā tendrils, kuśas and sandalwood paste, flowers and presents of food. They would have no danger from snakes. Vide Hemādri on Kāla p. 621, K. V. p. 413, K. R. p. 234. In Saurāṣṭra Nāgapañcami is observed in Srāvaṇa dark half.

It appears that in Bengal and south India (but not in Mahārāsṭra) there is worship of Manasādevi in one's own courtyard on a branch of the snuhi plant on the 5th of Śrāvaṇa dark half. The Rājamārtaṇḍa has four verses, one of which is quoted below. Samayapradipa and Kr̥tyaratnākara refer to the worship of Manasādevī. The Tithitattva[^322] (p. 33) contains the _dhyāna_ of Manasādevī taken from Padmapurāṇa. First, there is a saṅkalpa [^323] about the worship of Manasādevī in order to get rid of the danger from snake-bite, then one offers _gandha_, flowers, incense, lamp and _naivedya_ and then Ananta and other _nāgas_ are offered worship, the principal item being naivedya of milk and ghee. Nimba leaves are placed inside the house and the performer eats them and also makes brāhmaṇas eat them. The Brahmavaivartapurāṇa (II) devotes two chapters (45-46) to the birth of Manasādevī, her _pūjā_ and stotra (praise) &c. Dr. Sukumar Sen has edited in the B. I. series Vipradāsa's 'Manasāvijaya'.

In the Deccan on Śrāvaṇa bright half 5th figures of snakes are drawn with red sandalwood paste on wooden boards, or clay images of snakes coloured yellow or black are purchased and worshipped and given milk and snake charmers go about with snakes of all sorts, to which people offer milk and some money is paid to the snake charmers.

[^321]:  वासुकिस्तक्षकश्चैव कालियो मणिभद्रकः। ऐरावतो धृतराष्ट्रः कर्कोटकधनञ्जयौ । एतेऽभयं प्रयच्छन्ति प्राणिनां प्राणजीविनाम्। भविष्योत्तर 32.2-3 (with slight variations) q. by का. वि. p. 413. In other puraṇas twelve nagas are named e. g. कृत्यतत्त्व p. 437 and तिथितत्त्व p. 33 quote from गरुड 'अनन्तं वासुकिं शङ्खं पद्मं कम्बलमेव च । तथा कर्कोटकं नागं धृतराष्ट्रं च शङ्खकम् । कालियं तक्षकं चापि पिङ्गलं मणिभद्रकम् । यजेत्तानसितान्नागान दष्टमुक्तो दिवं व्रजेत्'॥. भविष्योत्तर 36. 48-49 and Bhavisya I. 32. 50-51 also set out twelve names of Nāgas, each one being the object of worship in each of the twelve months of the year.

[^322]: सुप्ते जनार्दने कृष्णपञ्चम्यां भवनाङ्गणे । पूजयेन्मनसां देवीं स्नुहीविटपसंस्थिताम् पिचुमर्दस्य पत्राणि स्थापयेद्भवनोदरे। स्वयं चापि तदश्नीयाद् ब्राह्मणांश्चापि भोजयेत् ॥ मनसा देवीं विषहरीं स्नुही सिजुवृक्षः। तिथितत्त्व pp. 33-34, कृत्यतत्त्व p. 537, का. वि. p. 414. स्नुही is a plant from the bark of which oozes a sticky substance. Its botanical name is Euforbia nerifolia, according to Prof. Golokendranath Bhattacharya of Berhampore Kṛṣṇanath College in West Bengal. वामनशयनानन्तरमसिततिथिः पञ्चमी या तु । उत्थानं मनसाया मिथुनरवौ कर्कटे वापि ॥ राजमार्तण्ड, folio 72b verse 1191 (vide ABORI vol. 36 p. 316). समयप्रदीप (folio 36a) adds 'अत्र तिक्तकदुकषायमधुराणां क्रमेण भक्षणमाचरन्ति.'

[^323]: The सङ्कल्प is अद्य श्रावणे मासि कृष्ण पक्षे पञ्चम्यां तिथौ अमुकगोत्रः श्रीअमुकदेवशर्मा सर्पभयाभावकामो मनसा देवीपूजामहं करिष्ये इति सङ्कल्प्प स्नुहीवृक्षं पूजयेत्तदभावे घटे जले वा। कुत्यतत्त्व p. 437.

If pañcami is mixed with the 4th and 6th tithis, that mixed with the 6th is to be preferred. The Vratakālaviveka [^324] speaks of Manasāvrata on Jyeṣṭha-śukla 10th with Hasta-nakṣatra or without it and remarks that when this vrata is performed Manasā goddess protects a man from the danger of poisonous snakes.

## Nāgas in Epic and Purāṇas

How and when serpent worship arose in India is a difficult problem. The Ṛgveda contains no reference to snake worship. On the contrary the Vedic god Indra is said to be the killer of _ahi_ (a serpent) in Ṛg. II. 30. 1, II. 19. 3 and the slaughter of _ahi_ is frequently mentioned as in Ṛg. I. 165. 6, III, 47 4. That _ahi_ meant a serpent with a hood is clear from Ṛg. VI. 75. 14 (ahiriva bhogaiḥ paryeti bāhum). In Br. Up. IV. 4.7 and Praśna IV. 5 there are references to the cast-off slough of serpents (mentioned as 'pādodara' whose feet are inside its body ) and in Ṛg. IX. 86. 44 ( ahir na jūrṇāmati sarpati tvacam) also. But, in many passages of the Ṛgveda (such as I. 32. 11) _ahi_ appears to have a metaphorical sense and refers to a demon like Vṛtra that prevented waters from flowing down. In the Tai. S. IV. 2. 8. 3. and Vāj. S. (XIII. 6-8) there are three verses that contain salutations to serpents. In the Atharvaveda (VIII. 14. 13-15) there is a reference to serpents some of which like Takṣaka and Dhṛtarāṣṭra are named. The Kāṭhaka S. V. 6 enumerates the pitṛs, sarpas, gandharvas, waters and herbs as pañcajana, and the Ait. Br. XIII. 7 asserts that gods, men, gandharvas, apsarases, snakes and pitṛs were pañcajana. This cannot be the meaning of 'pañcajanāḥ' in Ṛg. X. 53. 4. The above passages show that sarpas had come to be a clan like gandharvas in late vedic times.

In the Āśv. gr. II. 1. 1-15, the Pāraskara-gṛhya II. 14 and other gṛhya sūtras a rite called 'sarpabali' (offering to serpents) was performed on the Full Moon day of Śrāvaṇa. Vide H. of Dh. vol II. pp. 821-823 for a description. The nāgas figure frequently in the Mahābhārata. Vide Ādi. chap. 35 enumerating the names of many nāgas beginning with Śeṣa and chap. 123. 71, Udyoga 103. 9-16 (naming numerous nāgas). Arjuna while engaged in his twelve years' vow of brahmacarya came to the country of the Nāgas (probably a tribe that had nāga as their emblem) and took as his wife Ulūpi, a Nāga princess who was smitten by love. Babhruvāhana, son of Citrāṅgadā, fought with Arjuna who had come to Maṇipura for protecting the Aśvamedha horse, was killed by Babhruvāhana and restored to life with the help of a Sanjivana jewel (Āśvamedhikaparva chap. 79-81). Serpents came to be associated with both Viṣṇu and Śiva. Viṣṇu is said to sleep on the hoods of Śeṣa-nāga (Vanaparva 203. 12 and 272. 38–39) and Śiva wears serpents on his body like yajñopavita (Anuśāsana 14. 55). [^325] In the Bhagavadgitā X. 28-29 Lord Kṛṣṇa identifies himself with Vāsuki among serpents and Ananta among nāgas. What difference is made between 'sarpa' and 'nāga' is not clear. Probably 'sarpa' means all creeping things, while nāga means 'the cobra'. The Purāṇas are full of stories about nāgas. Vide J. Ph. Vogel's painstaking work (Indian Serpent Lore, 1926) based on the Mahābhārata, the Purāṇas and the Rājatarangiṇi. It appears that serpent worship arose gradually from the fear of serpents that must have taken a heavy toll of life, particularly at the beginning of the rainy season. Even in these days about 10000 people die of snake bite every year in India, while persons killed by all wild animals are hardly 3000. Why the tithi was changed from Full Moon (for Sarpabali in the gṛhya sūtras) to the 5th of the bright half is not clear. It may be due to the slight change in the time of the onset of rains owing to the precession of the equinoxes. Vide Fergusson's Tree and Serpent worship’ pp. 1-75 and Plate XV which reproduces the sculptures on the eastern gateway of Sanchi, where occurs the figure of five-headed Nāga. Stone images of serpents under sacred trees like _pippala_ are common in the Draviḍa country and a few temples dedicated to nāgas exist such as the one at Battis Shirālen in Satara District and at Bhom-parānden in Hyderabad.  

[^324]: यथा कृत्यकामधेनुधृतो व्यासः । ज्येष्ठ शुक्लदशम्यां तु हस्तर्क्षे ब्रह्मरूपिणी ॥ कश्यपान्मनसा देवी जातेति मनसा स्मृता। तस्मात्तां पूजयेत्तत्र वर्षे वर्षे विधानतः। अनन्ताद्यष्टनागांश्च नरो नियमतत्परः ॥ ... हस्तनक्षत्रयुतदशम्यां पूजयेदित्येको विधिः। केवलदशम्यामपीत्यपरश्च । व्रतकालविवेक (in I. H. p. vol. 17 No. 4 supplement p. 16).

## Rakṣābandhana

On the Full Moon of Śrāvaṇa there is in the afternoon a ceremony called Rakṣābandhana (tying the protective amulet). It is described by Hemādri on vrata, vol. II, pp. 190–195, N. 8. p. 121, P.C. 284-285, Vratārka (folio 335a-336a). One should at sunrise on Full Moon of Śrāvaṇa and after offering tarpaṇa to gods, sages and pitṛs, get prepared a protective packet (or amulet) containing whole rice grains and mustard and decorated with gold (thread) and strung together with variously coloured threads and have such an amulet tied. In the case of a king, a jar should be placed on a square raised in the palace and the king should occupy his seat together with his ministers, he should be surrounded by courtesans and music and benedictory words should go forth; gods, brāhmaṇas and arms should be first honoured, then the royal [^326] priest should tie the amulet to the accompaniment of the mantra. 'I tie on you that whereby Bali, the very powerful king of demons, was bound; O protective (amulet), don't slip off, don't slip off.' All including śūdras and other human beings should get the amulet tied after honouring priests according to ability. When this is done, a man lives on happily for a year. Hemādri quotes Bhaviṣyottara for the story that Indrāni tied on the right hand of Indra a protective amulet whereby he was enabled to vanquish the _asuras_. This tying should not be done when paurṇimā is mixed up with either 14th or the following pratipad. It may, in order to avoid these two, be done even at night.

This ceremony of tying an amulet on the right wrist is still in vogue and priests go about tying these amulets and receive some fee for doing so. Mukerji (p. 81) is unduly harsh on the poor brāhmaṇas when he says that it is a day of blackmail by the priests. Women in Gujarat and some other places tie silken amulets round the wrists of their brothers and give and receive presents.  

On the Full Moon day of Śrāvaṇa it is usual on the sea coast of western India (particularly in Konkan and Malabar) not only for Hindus, but also for Moslems and Parsis of the merchant class to go to the sea and offer flowers and a cocoanut to the sea. The sea becomes less rough and the violence of the monsoon winds abates after the Full Moon of Śrāvaṇa and the cocoanut is offered to the sea god (Varuṇa) in order that he may make sea voyage for vessels of merchandise safe.


[^325]: नागयज्ञोपवीती च नागचर्मोत्तरच्छदः। अनुशासन 14. 55. Rudra is so described. सहस्रशीर्षा पुरुषः स्वप्तुकामस्वतीन्द्रियः। फटासहस्रविकटं शेषं पर्यङ्कभाजनम् । वनपर्व 272. 38.

## Antiquity of Krṣṇa worship

In Śrāvaṇa on the 8th of the dark half is celebrated the Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭami or Janmāṣṭami vrata and festival, which is probably the most important vrata and utsava celebrated throughout the whole of India.

In some Purāṇa passages it is declared that Janmāṣṭami is celebrated on the 8th of the dark half of Bhādrapada. The explanation is that in those passages the months are Pūrṇimānta and the dark half is in these months the first pakṣa.[^327] The Padma (III, 13), Matsya 56, Agni 183 contain numerous verses on the greatness (māhātmya) of Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭami.

It would not be out of place to say a few words about Kṛsṇa and about the antiquity of Kṛṣṇa worship. There is a reference in the Chāndogya-upaniṣad (III. 17. 6) to Kṛṣṇa Devakīputra receiving instruction from Ghora Āṅgirasa. There was a Vedic poet named Kṛṣṇa who calls upon the Aśvins to listen to his invocation in Ṛg. VIII. 85. 3 and the Anukramaṇi assigns Ṛg. VIII. 86-87 to Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa. Jain tradition regards Kṛṣṇa as contemporaneous with Nemi, the 22nd Tirthaṅkara, and from the account of the 63 great men of Jain pre-history about one third are shown as associated with Kṛșṇa. The life of Kṛṣṇa as gathered from the Mahābhārata is a composite one. In some passages he is depicted as a Yādava prince, the staunchest friend of the Pāndavas [^328] (and particularly of Arjuna), as a great warrior, statesman and philosopher. In other passages he is identified with the Supreme Lord of the worlds and as Viṣṇu Himself (Sānti 47. 28, Droṇa 146. 67–68, Karṇa 87.74, Vanaparva 49. 20, Bhīṣma 21. 13-15). There are most sublime praises of Kṛṣṇa put in the mouths of Yudhisthira (Droṇa 149. 16-33), Draupadi (Vanaparva 263. 8-16) and Bhiṣma when about to die (Anuśāsana 167. 37-45). We have further information about him from the Harivaṁśa, the Viṣṇupurāṇa, Vāyu (98.100-102). the Bhāgavata and Brahmavaivarta that deal with Kṛṣṇa's romantic career among cowherds, which is wanting in the Mahābhārata.

It appears from Pāṇini (IV. 3. 98 ) [^329] that there were people in his day described as Vāsudevaka and Arjunaka that were devoted to Vasudeva and Arjuna. Patañjali in his Mahābhāṣya mentions several persons and incidents connected with Kṛṣṇa. On Vārtika 6 to Pān. III. 1. 26 the Mahābhāṣya gives two examples 'Kaṁsam ghātayati' (meaning 'he tells the story of the slaughter of Kaṁsa') and 'Balim bhandhayati' (meaning 'he narrates the story of the imprisonment of Bali'). In Vārtika 2 to Pāṇ. III. 1.138 the word 'Govinda' is derived from go+vinda). On Vārtika 2 to Pān. III. 2. 111 Patañjali gives the example ‘Jaghāna Kaṁsam kila Vāsudevaḥ' (Vāsudeva, they say, killed Kaṁsa) and implies that the incident occurred long ago which the speaker could not have seen but was popularly known.[^330] This is a quarter of an Upendravajrā or Upajāti verse. Patañjali names Satyabhāmā with its shortened form Bhāmā (Kielhorn, vol. I. p. 111), the words 'Vasudevavargyaḥ' and 'Akrūravargyaḥ' occur (on Vārtika 11 on Pāṇ. IV.2.104). On Pāṇ. IV. 1.114 (r̥ṣyardhakavr̥ṣṇi-kurubhyaś-ca) under vārtika 7 Patañjali mentions Ugrasena as a scion of the Andhakas and Vāsudeva and Bāladeva of the Vr̥ṣṇis. Patañjali quotes half of an Anuṣṭubh verse 'Saṅkarṣaṇa-dvitiyasya balam Kṛṣṇasya vardhatām' (Kielhorn's ed. vol. I. p. 426). Patañjali is regarded by most modern scholars as having flourished in the 2nd century B. C. (about 150 B. C.). Therefore it follows that some poetic work or works that referred to incidents, of Kṛṣṇa's career (such as Kaṁsavadha) had been composed some centuries before the Christian era. Vide I, A. Vol. III. pp. 14-16 for allusions to Kṛṣṇa in the Mahābhāṣya and I. A. vol. XIV pp. 326 ff, for verse quotations in the Mahābhāṣya collected by Kielhorn. In the Ādiparva (chap. 1. 256)[^331] and in Sabhā 33, 10-11 Kr̥ṣṇa is identified with Vāsudeva and is said to be the Highest Brahma and the source of the universe. The Ghosundi inscription of 2nd or 1st century B. C. mentions the hall of worship of Saṅkarṣaṇa and Vāsudeva (E. I. 16 pp. 25-27, E. I, 22 p. 198, I. A. vol. 61 p. 203) addressed as 'Bhagavat' and 'sarveśvara'. Nanaghat cave inscriptions of about 200 B. C. mention both (A.S. W. I, vol. V pp. 60–74). The Besnagar column (Garuḍa-dhvaja ) Vaiṣṇava inscription [^332] where the _Bhāgavata_ Heliodorus, son of Diya, hailing from Taksasilā and Yavana ambassador of king Antalikita (Antalkidas) to king Bhāgabhadra mentions Vāsudeva as '_devadeva_'. The preceding items of evidence indicate that the worship of Vāsudeva was prevalent in northern and central India from at least 500 B. C.. if not earlier. Vide R. G. Bhandarkar's 'Vaiṣṇavism, Śaivism &c.' pp. 1-45 for the various phases of the Kṛṣṇa cult and its antiquity.

It is rather surprising that the passages quoted in the medieval works on Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭami are mostly borrowed from the Bhaviṣya, Bhaviṣyottara, Skanda, Viṣṇudharmottara, Nāradiya and Brahmavaivarta purāṇas, but hardly ever from the Bhāgavata-purāṇa which is the Veda of the Vaiṣṇavas of later medieval and modern times. The description of Kṛṣṇa's birth in the Bhāgavata is vague and commonplace. All that [^333] is said there is that the time when Kṛṣṇa was born was endowed with all good characteristics and was very charming, that the quarters looked very clear and the sky was lit up by bright stars, that the wind that blew was very pleasing to the skin and laden with fine fragrance and that when Janārdana was born of Devaki it was midnight and darkness had enveloped everything.

In the Bhaviṣyottara (44.1-69) Kr̥ṣṇa himself is represented as narrating to Yudhiṣṭhira the incidents of Janmāṣṭami-vrata: 'I was born of Vasudeva and Devaki on the 8th of Bhādrapada dark half at midnight when the Sun was in Lion (Leo), when the Moon was in the sign of the Bull (Taurus) and there was Rohiṇi nakṣatra' (verses 74-75), when on the 8th of the dark half of Śravaṇa there is Rohiṇi-nakṣatra, the tithi is called Jayanti; if a man observes a fast on that tithi, that destroys his sins committed in childhood, youth, old age and many previous lives.' The result is that if there be no Rohiṇi nakṣatra on Śrāvaṇa dark half 8th, it is simply Janmāṣṭamī, but when Rohiṇi is joined to dark 8th of Śrāvaṇa it is Jayanti. The Rājamārtaṇḍa has two verses on this.[^334]

[^330]: The passage about the killing of Kaṁsa is interesting: इह तु कथं वर्तमानकालता कंसं घातयति बलिं बन्धयतीति चिरहते कंसे चिरबद्धे च बलौ' (महाभाष्य ed, by Kielhorn, vol. II. p. 36). This shows that in the time of the महाभाष्य the killing of Kaṁsa (by Kṛṣṇa) was supposed to have taken place in hoary antiquity. Patañjali states further on that Kaṁsavadha was represented dramatically, that pictures were painted about it and lastly that works had been composed narrating that event.

These are quoted as from भविष्य by व. क्रि. को. p. 299.


## Jayanti and Janmāṣtami

The important question is whether the Janmāṣṭami-vrata and Jayanti-vrata are really only one vrata or whether they are two separate vratas. The Kālanirṇaya,[^335] after a long discussion in which Mimāṁsā principles contained in Jai. II. 2.23 and IV. 1. 22-24 are relied upon, arrives at the conclusion that the two are separate vratas on the grounds that the two names are different (viz. Janmāṣṭami-vrata and Jayantivrata), their occasions (_nimitta_) are different (the first depends only on dark Aṣṭami, while the latter exists only if there is Rohiṇi on 8th of dark half of Śrāvaṇa) and their characteristics are different in that in Janmāṣṭamīvrata śāstra requires only a fast, while in Jayantivrata the śāstra requires a fast and also gifts and the like. Besides, Janmāṣṭamivrata is obligatory (_nitya_), since the texts only speak of the incurring of sin if it be not performed, while Jayantīvrata is both _nitya_ and _kāmya_ in that the śāstras connect it with special rewards in addition to the incurring of sin by its non-observance. Further, the two are separately mentioned in the same verses.[^336] Hemādri, Madanaratna, the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 126) and several works hold the view that the two are different. But the N. S. notes [^337] that in its day people observed only Janmāṣṭami-vrata and not Jayanti-vrata. On the other hand the Jayantinirṇaya (p. 25) states that people generally celebrate Jayanti only (and not Janmāṣṭami). This variance is probably due to the fact that the two works (N. S. and J. N.) belong to the north and south of India. The Samayamayūkha [^338] and Puruṣārthacintīmaṇi (p. 117 ) very severely criticize the views of Madhava set out above from the Kālanirṇaya, one of the principal arguments in these last being that the Mimāṁsā rules relied upon by Madhava apply to rites, but Jayanti is the name of a tithi i. e. the 8th of dark half when conjoined to Rohiṇī. The Jayantinirṇaya of Hārīta Venkatanātha holds that the two are different and that both are nitya as well as kāmya (pp. 4-5 and p. 30). It further points out (p. 19) that in Janmāṣṭamīvrata tithi is the principal matter while in Jayanti it is the nakṣatra (Rohiṇi) that is principal.

Two discordant notes are struck by the Varāha-purāṇa and by the Harivaṁśa. The former says [^339] that Kṛṣṇa was born on 12th of Aṣāḍha bright half. According to the Harivaṁśa q. by Hemādri and Jimūtavāhana, the nakṣatra was Abhijit when Kṛṣṇa was born and the muhūrta was _vijaya_[^340]. It is quite possible that these two represent some older traditions about the date of the birth of Kṛṣṇa.

Another important point very much canvassed in the medieval digests is about the exact tithi and time when the Janmāṣṭamīvrata is to be celebrated. The K. N. (pp. 215-224), Kṛtyatattva pp. 438-444, Tithitattva pp. 47-51, Samayamayūkha p. 50-51, N. S. pp. 128–130 and several other digests state certain conclusions about this.

It is clear from almost all Purāṇas and other works on Janmāṣṭami that the principal time for the celebration of the birth of Kṛṣṇa is the midnight[^341] of the 8th of Śrāvaṇa dark half (Bhādrapada dark, if the month is Purnimānta). This tithi is of two kinds viz. (1) without Rohiṇi nakṣatra and (2) with Rohiṇi nakṣatra. In each of these two, the Kālanirṇaya of Madhava (pp. 218-224), the Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 128-130 ), the Dharmasindhu (pp. 64-67 ) and other digests set out several possible alternative combinations. The Nirṇayāmr̥ta (pp. 56 58) mentions as many as 18 kinds, eight of the _śuddhā_ tithi, 8 of the _viddhā_ tithi and two more, one being the one where Rohiṇi nakṣatra is there at midnight and the other being Navami joined to Rohiṇi and having either Wednesday or Monday. A discussion of these would be somewhat complicated and hardly otherwise than of academical interest to modern readers. Therefore, all these alternatives are not set out here. Instead, the brief conclusions put forth by the Tithitattva are given[^342] by way of sample. These are: If Jayanti (Aṣṭami with Rohiṇi) exists only a single day, the fast must be observed on that very day; if it spreads over two days, then the fast is on the later of the two; if there is no Jayanti, then the fast is to be observed on Aṣṭami joined with Rohiṇi; if two days have Aṣṭami joined to Rohiṇi, then fast is on the later of the two; if there is no Rohiṇi nakṣatra then fast is to be observed on the Aṣṭami that exists at midnight or if aṣṭami exists on two days at midnight or if it be not existent at midnight then on the later day.

If Jayanti fast occurs on Wednesday or Monday there are far greater results and such a fast is superior to crores of other vratas and the man who observes a fast on Jayanti conjoined to Wednesday or Monday would not be born again[^343].

Kṛṣṇa belonged to the Somavaṁśa and Budha is deemed in legend and astrology to be the son of the Moon. Vide हरिवंश I. 25.43-45 for the legend. It is probably due to this that Wednesday and Monday are deemed to heighten the importance of Janmāṣṭami.

## Items in Janmāṣṭamīvrata

The main items in Janmāṣṭamīvrata are fast, worship of Kṛṣṇa, jāgara ( keeping awake at night, listening to and repeating hymns of praise and stories about Kṛṣṇa's exploits), pāraṇā.

The medieval digests such as Tithitattva (pp. 42-47), the Samayamayūkha (pp. 52-57), Kālatattvayivecana (pp. 52-56), Vratarāja (pp. 274–277), Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) contain a lengthy procedure of Janmāṣṭamīvrata based principally on Bhaviṣyottara chap. 55. A brief summary from the first two works (which agree in the main in most respects) is set out below.

On the day of the fast in the morning the devotee should invoke the presence of the Sun, Moon, Yama, Time, the two twilights, the (five) elements, Day and Night, Wind, the lord of the quarters, the earth, the sky, the denizens of aerial regions and gods[^344]. He should hold in his hand a copper vessel filled with water, some fruits, flowers and whole rice-grains, refer to the month &c. and make a saṅkalpa ‘I shall perform the Kr̥ṣṇāṣṭami-vrata, for securing a certain reward or for the removal of my sins'. He then repeats four mantras addressed to Vāsudeva, one of which is quoted below[^345]. After repeating the mantras he should discharge the water in the vessel. He should construct a delivery hall for Devakī having auspicious jars full of water and mango leaves, garlands of flowers, fragrant with burnt _aguru_ and decked with auspicious things and Şaṣthi-devi. Round about the room or the walls (of the room) he should paint gods and gandharvas with folded hands, Vasudeva with a drawn sword, Devaki, Nanda, Yaśodā, gopis, Kaṁsa's guards, the river Yamunā and the snake Kāliya therein and other incidents of Gokula as far as he could. He should place in the delivery hall a bed surrounded by screens. He should take a bath with sesame in the noon in the water of a river or the like and at midnight make the saṅkalpa, 'I shall perform the worship of Kṛṣṇa with his attendants'; he should make an image of Kṛṣṇa of gold or silver &c., touch the cheeks of the image and vitalize the image (prāṇa-pratiṣṭhā) with mantras. He should contemplate upon Devaki (with a mantra) and on Śrikr̥ṣṇa lying as an infant on the bed and offer worship to Lakṣmi, to Vasudeva and Devaki, Nanda and Yaśoda, Baladeva and Caṇḍikā with appropriate mantras for bath, for incense, naivedya &c.; he then briefly performs symbolically the ceremonies of Jātakarma, cutting the navel chord, Ṣaṣṭhīpūjā and nāmakaraṇa. Then at time of moonrise (at or a little after midnight) he should offer _arghya_ on an altar or to (image of) the moon with Rohiṇi with water from a conch mixed with flowers, kuśas and sandalwood paste with a mantra, should bow to the moon and prostrate[^346] himself with several verses containing the different names of Vāsudeva and at the end address prayers to him. Then he should keep awake the whole night in listening to the hymns of praise to Kr̥ṣṇa, to the stories in the Puraṇas and in songs, music and dances. Next day after performing all usual acts to be performed in the morning and again offering worship to the image of God Kṛṣṇa, he should feed brāhmaṇas and donate to them gold, cow, clothes with the words 'May Kṛṣṇa be pleased with me'. He should then repeat the mantra[^347] 'salutation to him who is Brahma, who is Vāsudeva of blessed birth and beneficent to cows and brāhmaṇas and whom Devaki gave birth from Vasudeva for the protection of Vedas spread over the earth. Let there be peace! Let there be bliss! He should then take out the image of Kṛṣṇa, donate it to a brāhmaṇa and bring the vrata to a close after performing pāraṇā.

[^346]: One of the Mantras at the time of falling prostrate is: शरणं तु प्रपद्येहं सर्वकामार्थसिद्धये। प्रणमामि सदा देवं वासुदेवं जगत्पतिम्॥ स. म. P, 54 and ति. त. p. 45. Two of the प्रार्थनामन्त्रs are : त्राहि मां सर्वदुःखघ्न रोगशोकार्णवाद्धरे। दुर्गतांस्त्रायसे विष्णो ये स्मरन्ति सकृत् सकृत् । सोऽहं देवातिदुर्वृत्तस्त्राहि मां शोकसागरात् । पुष्कराक्ष निमग्नोहं मायाविज्ञानसागरे। ibid.

The first verse is quoted from गरुड by व.क्रि. को. P. 313.

## Procedure of Janmāṣtami vrata

The procedure in the Dharmasindhu (pp. 68-69) is more elaborate than the above, though no essential difference exists. It makes use of Vedic mantras (from Ṛg. X. 90. 1-16) along with Paurāṇika mantras, while in the Samaya-mayukha and Tithi tattva no Vedic mantra is expressly mentioned. As regards jāgara the Dharmasindhu provides that the stories 348 about Kṛṣṇa may be made striking by reciting poems composed in regional languages, that Vedic hymns may have at their end Paurāṇika stories rocited, that visual representations (such as dances) may be resorted to, that this is a procedure meant for the three higher varṇas, but in the case of śūdras it is not proper to follow the same procedure; they should omit Vedic hymns but may engage in music and Paurāṇika recitations.

One question often raised in some of the medieval digests on Dharmaśāstra is: what is the principal matter in Janmāstaml vrata. Some held that both fast (upavāsa) and worship (pājā) are principal and they rely on a Bhaviṣyapurāṇa 349 passage 'when at midnight on the 8th of the dark half there is Rohini, worship of Kṛṣṇa destroys sins committed in three lives; a man observing a fast then and performing worship of Hari does not sink'. The Samayamayūkha, after an elaborate discussion in which Mimāṁsā doctrines such as those in Jai. I. 4. 1-3 are employed, arrives at the conclusion that the fast is only an auxiliary (anga), while worship (pūjā) is the principal thing. On the other hand the Tithitattva350 relying on the verse of the

___348. तथा च वैदिकसूक्तकरणकस्तुतिविशिष्टः पौराणेतिहासमिश्रितो गीतनृत्ययुत वेशभाषाकाव्यप्रमुखकथाकरणको जागरो विभादिवर्णत्रयस्य विधीयते। शूद्रादीन्प्रति एतादृश जागरस्य विधातुमयोग्यत्वात् । वचनान्तरेण तु सूक्तादिरहित-गीतादिविशिष्टो वर्णचतुष्टय साधारणो विधीयते। धर्मसिन्धु pp. 70-71. The word 'अयोग्यत्वात् ! is used because in those days sudras were not entitled to study and recite Vedic Mantras. ____349. अर्धरात्रे तु रोहिण्यां यदा कृष्णाष्टमी भवेत्। तस्यामम्यर्चनं शौरईन्ति पाप

Bhaviṣya opening the description of the vrata 'On that day one should accept the restrictions of upavāsa' and also Mimāmgā doctrines holds that upavāsa is the principal matter and pūjā is an anga (auxiliary matter). The Jayantīnirṇaya contained in the Dasanirṇayi of Hārīta Venkatanātha discusses at length the two (pp. 3 ff). This subject need not be pursued much further.

It has already been stated above that every vrata requires a pāraṇa as the last item, that pārana takes place the day after the day of the fast and that it is generally performed in the morning. There are certain special rules about the pāraṇa of Janmāṣtami fast and Jayanti fast. A few dicta of the purāṇas may be first noted. The Brahmavaivarta 351 states 'one should never perform pārana while astami tithi is running or Rohini naksatra is still there on the Astami; (if one does so) one destroys what he has done previously and the fruits acquired by the fast. A tithi destroys eight-fold, while a naksatra does so fourfold; therefore one should perform the pārana (of Janmāṣṭami) at the end of the tithi and naksatra'. The Nāradapurāṇa 352 remarks when a fast has to be observed on the conjunction of a tithi and nakṣatra, pārapa should not be done until at least one of the two has ended; when a vrata falls on a conjunction (of tithi and nakṣatra), pāraṇa should be done only when one of the two is Beparated (i. e. ends)'. The Vahni-purāṇa provides pārana is commended at the end of the nakṣatra or at the end of the tithi'. Both the Tithitattva and the Kr̥tyatattva 353 arrive on interpret ing these and other verses at the following conclusions. 'Pāraṇa is to be observed on the day after the fast, but after the end of the tithi (astami) and the naksatra (Rohini); but when one of

the two ends before mahāniśā and the other during mahānisā or after it, pāraṇa should be observed at the end of one of the two; when both exist during the period of mahāniśā then one should perform pārana in the morning at the end of the festival'. At the end of the pārana the performer repeats the mantra 'salutations to Govinda, who is Being, who is the ruler of (all) beings, who is the lord of (all) beings and who is the source of all beings'.354 The above statement shows that in certain cases the pārana of Janmāṣṭamivrata may be at night,355 particularly for vaiṣṇavas who perform the vrata ag a duty and not for any reward.

There is a difference of meaning between udyāpana and pārana. Some vratas like Ekādaśī and Janmāstams are per formed throughout a man's life; in such cases there is only pārapa after the fast on every occasion that a fast is observed. If a man undertakes a vrata only once and finishes it, then the concluding rites of the vrata are called udyāpana.

Besides the items mentioned above, it is the practice, parti cularly of boys and common people in Mahārāṣṭra, to hang up pots full of curds and buttermilk on the day after the birth of Kṛṣṇa is celebrated, to play underneath the pot, sing songs and then pierce the pot and get drenched by curds and buttermilk running out from the holes made. This is probably due to the legends associated with Kṛṣṇa's boyhood among cowherds. The Bhāgavata 356 expressly says that the cowherds sprinkled each other on Kssna's birth with curds, milk, ghee, and smeared each other with these. This is called 'Gopālakālā in Mahārāstra. But this is not observed in other parts of India such as Saurastra. Surprisingly enough the Kṛṣṇajanmāstaml festival does not, like the Rāmanavami festival, figure in the Kṛtya kalpataru on vrata. One cannot account for this omission.

But in the Naiyatakāla section 357 of the same work, a brief procedure of Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭami (which is word for word the same in the Kr̥tyaratnākara) different from the one specified above from the Tithitattva and other works, is set out. It is as follows: On the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada was born in Kaliyuga in the 28th (kalpa?), Kṛṣṇa, son of Devaki, for removing the burden (of the earth) and the reduction of ksatriyas. He (his image) should therefore be worshipped on that day, as also (of) Devaki and Yasodā with sandalwood paste, flowers, incense, various fruits and foods and dishes prepared from barley and wheat together with cow's milk. At night the devotee should keep awake with songs and dances. Then on the 9th about the time of arunodaya (4 ghaṭikās before sunrise ) women dressed in red clothes and decked with garlands of flowers should carry the images of these (Kṛṣṇa, Devakī and Yaśodā) to a holy river bank or to a charming and unfrequented lake, wherein they should themselves take their bath and also bathe the images; then returning home they should eat a meal of barley together with jaggery, honey, ghee and black pepper.

Before closing this account of Janmāṣṭami reference must be made to a paper read in 1867 before the Berlin Akademie der Wissenschaften by the renowned German scholar, Prof. A. Weber. The subject of the paper was 'An investigation into the origin of the festival of Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭami' and the paper was divided into four parts; the first dealt with the sources (an English translation of it by E. Rehatsek was published in Indian Antiquary vol. VI. pp. 161-180 and pp. 281-301 ), the 2nd dealt with ritual, the 3rd part was the most important and was con cerned with a novel theory, viz. the ritual of Krṣnāstami festival was something transferred from outside of India, that the description in the ritual of Kṛṣṇa's image as suckling at the mother's (Devaki's) breast was the keystone of the theory of this ritual as of foreign origin and that it was suggested by pictorial representations of the Madonna with a suckling child (Christ)

Weber's theory about Janmāṣtami

&c. An English translation of this part appeared in Indian Antiquary, vol. III. pp. 21-25 and pp. 47–52. This paper, though it is a monument of learning and patient industry (for that period when very few Sanskrit books had been printed ), gave rise to severe criticism owing to its fantastic and perverse conclusion about Kṛṣṇajanmāṣṭami ritual being borrowed from Christian representations of Christ and his mother Mary. In I. A, vol. III. p. 300 Growse attacked it very severely. In spite of all criticisms the tenacious German scholar stuck to his guns and launched an attack against his critics, particularly against Dr. Rajendralal Mitra, in I. A. vol. IX. pp. 226-229. As hardly any Sanskrit scholar in these days would espouse the theory put forward by Weber, I do not think that I should waste much time over a refutation thereof. Most European scholars, nurtured on the vaunted intellectual eminence of the ancient Greeks and on the intolerant attitude of christianity towards other faiths, when they became acquainted with things Indian and studied Sanskrit, were obsessed (though not very obviously expressed) by two notions, viz. much in India that resembled what prevailed in the West must have been borrowed from the West and further, that Indians, who had allowed themselves to be invaded by outsiders and governed by foreigners for centuries, must not have been good at anything. These two notions gave rise to many untenable theories such as the following: the Rāmāyana was borrowed from Homer's Iliad, the art of writing was un known to Pāṇini, the Brāhmi script was based on Phoenician or Aramaic script, that the Gītā was based on the Bible, that the very ancient Indian naksatra system was borrowed either from the Chinese, the Babylonians or Arabs. Most of such theories were the result of little knowledge and the non-recognition of certain common sense rules and have now been consigned to the limbo of deserved oblivion. The common sense rule is that when a thing or a state of things has existed for centuries in a certain country or among a certain people, the burden of proving that it was borrowed by that country or people from outside is very heavy on those who assert such borrowing; mere similarities can never he held to amount to any evidence of borrowing at all; scholars should be very chary of confidently asserting borrowing and should put forward their conclusions very cauti ously. It would not be irrelevant to point out the main circum stances on which Weber, often a champion of lost causes, relied for his theory.

The first is that in the ritual of Krspāstami contained in some digests (that said that they borrowed the passage from Bhavisyottara) the image of Kṛṣṇa was to be shown 358 as suckl. ing at the breast of Devaki, that this is a unique direction, that in the Ramanavami festival which is similar to Janmāṣṭami the image of Rāma is not required to be suckling at the breast of Kausalyā, that this detail was copied from the representation of the Madonna Lactans. Weber relied (vide I. A. vol. III p. 51 ) on ono De Bossi who said that pictures of infant Christ at the breast existed in 2nd century A. D. Weber brushed aside the testimony of other scholars that the Madonna with the child was a subject little known to the early christian centuries and the opinion of other scholars that the representations of the Madonna Lactang are extremely rare in Byzantine and Russian art (I. A. vol. III p. 48) and almost always of very late date. Weber makog a mountain of a molehill. The image of Rāma is also described as lying on the lap of the mother Kausalyā.359 Further, all purāṇas do not provide that the image of Kyspa was to be suckling at the breast. Hemādri, in describing the Jayantivrata from the Purāṇas, shows that the image was to be on the lap of the mother Devaki.360 Was the Hindu imagination so poor that when they could describe the image of Rāma or Kṛṣṇa as lying on the mother's lap they could not also imagine that it could be shown as suckling at the breast and had to run to the West to copy that detail from representations of the Madonna and the child thousands of miles away?

The 2nd point made much of by Weber was that Nārada is represented as having brought from Sveta-dvipa ( white land) the doctrine of salvation by faith. Weber holds that Svetadvipa was Alexandria, while Lassen holds that it was Parthia. If we read the description of Svetadvipa in the śāntiparva ( chapters

336-339 ) and in such Purāṇas 361 as Vāmana (chap. 25.16 and 60. 56) and Kūrma (I. 49) it would be clear that Svetadvipa was an imaginary or mythical place where everything was white, where Viṣṇu and the gods dwelt and that it had no earthly existence at least in the minds of the authors who wrote the above works.

The third important point according to Weber was that certain incidents in Kṛṣṇa's life such as Kāliya-mardana are similar to those in Christianity. Weber himself says that victory over Kāliya is a travesty of the christian tradition of the serpent. It appears to me that there is nothing common between the two except the word serpent.
