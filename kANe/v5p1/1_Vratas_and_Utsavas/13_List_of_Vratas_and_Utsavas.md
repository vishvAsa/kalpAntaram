## LIST OF VRATAS AND UTSAVAS

The following list of vratas and _utsavas_ does not claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But it is far more exhaustive and informative than any similar list so far prepared in English by any one or contained in any work in English. The line of demarcation between vratas and utsavas is very thin. Many vratas contain an element of festivities and many utsavas have more or less a religious element also and were religious in the beginning though later on they became secular, like the Olympic games of Greece. It may be pointed out that in the Asiatic Researches, vol. III, Sir William Jones published a list of Hindu festival days based on the Tithitattva (pp. 257-293 ) and Prof. Kielhorn also inserted a list of festival days based mainly on the Dharmasindhu in I. A. vol. 26 pp. 177-187. Both these are meagre. The Indian Ephemeris ( vol. I part 1 pp. 55-69 ) has a long descriptive list and a brief but accurate account of Indian festivals in relation to tithis and vice versa. Yet it is not as exhaustive as this list will be and it refers hardly to any authoritative texts. Very recently in the Report (1953) of the Calendar Reform Committee presided over by the late Dr. M. N. Saha there is a list of lunar festivals ( from Caitra onward) and solar festivals and of some important tithis (pp. 101–108) and an alphabeticed list of festivals ( pp. 111-115), which is exhaustive but its great defect is that no texts are cited or referred to and hardly any details are given except month, pakṣa and tithi. There are a few works on vratas written in Bengali and other regional languages of India, but I could not include most of them in this volume as I do not know most of those languages, though I have referred to some of them. Apart from vratas and utsavas certain matters and technical terms that occur frequently in works on vratas have been included. The list is arranged in the Sanskrit alphabetical order, though everything is transliterated into the English alphabet for the convenience of printing. For saving space abbreviations have been very largely employed and a list of the most important abbreviations is given in the preceding pages. As regards each vrata the time when it begins, whether it is a tithivrata or pāravrata, saṁvatsara-vrata or & nakṣatravrata or a prakirṇaka vrata is generally indicated ( except where from its very title or description its nature is clear), the deity to be worshipped is pointed out where possible or necessary, some details are added in certain cases, and some of the works in which it is described are mentioned. The rewards promised are not generally set out, as most of them are included in the rewards mentioned on p. 55–56 above, and as they are often too numerous to specify and also for reasons of space. Similarly, tithis that are Yugādi or Yugāntya or Manvādi or Kalpādi have not all been noted as they are too many but they are enumerated in one place under the words Yugādi &c. I have made great efforts to trace the Paurāṇic quotations to their sources, but I regret that I have not been quite successful owing to several causes such as the vast extent of Purāṇas, owing to several recensions of the same purāṇa and owing to my inadvertence or sheer weariness. One feels that tracing a verse to its origin is often as difficult as finding a pin in a haystack. The author or authors of Purāṇas often wrote like modern advertisers of medicines, toilet articles &c. Most of the vratas are said to have been declared by divinities like Śiva to Pārvati, by Kr̥ṣṇa to Yudhiṣṭhira, by great sages like Mārkaṇḍeya, Nārada, Dhaumya, Yājñavalkya, Vasiṣṭha and it is often added that the Vrata is a great secret not narrated or known even to gods and goddesses e.g. Śivarātrivrata (in HV II. 88).

It may not be out of place to point out here what should be done about the numerous vratas and utsavas, described so far and to be mentioned in the long list that follows. Many of the vratas and utsavas once observed have already gone out of vogue owing to various causes. But it would not do to recommend the abolition of all vratas and utsavas even in the latter half of the 20th century. Some seasonal vratas and festivals should be kept up as in the case of Divāli and Holikā, but they should be shorn of extravagances like gambling on Balipratipadā or the obscenities and dirt-throwing indulged in by some people in Holika. Other vratas and utsavas like the Rāmanavami, Vijaya daśamī, Kr̥ṣṇa-janmāṣṭami should also be celebrated in order to remind the present generation of the great heroes and _avatāras_ of the past and the supreme values they exemplified in their lives and a few new ones such as the Jayantis of Shivaji, Guru Govindsingh, Tagore, Tilak and Gandhi may be added. Besides, such vratas as Vaṭa-sāvitri and Haritālikā may still be emphasized for observance by women and lastly such nice observances redolent of disinterested regard and affection as Rakṣābandhana and Bhrātr̥dvitīyā deserve to be preserved.

It should be remembered that several vratas depend conjointly upon month, tithi and nakṣatra together. It is difficult to classify such vratas and my classification may in some cases appear to be arbitrary. For saving space the details mentioned above will not generally be conveyed in regular sentences, but in catch-words only. The figures after the abbreviated name of a work represent pages and Roman figures refer to volumes or parts; and double Arabic figures with a dot between represent chapter and verses respectively. As most vratas are tithivratas, the word tithi is not mentioned where the vrata has reference to a tithi alone and to no other particular (such as month or week-day &c.). The word vrata has been generally omitted after the names, except where I felt that doubt or confusion is likely to be caused. The word 'purāṇa' is not added to the names of purāṇas such as Agni, Vāmana &c. Except in the case of purāṇas references to medieval digests and commentaries are generally arranged in chronological order. The following abbreviations are used for months and half months: Cai. = Caitra, Vai. = Vaiśākha, Jy. = Jyeṣṭha, Ās. = Āṣāḍha, Śr. = Śrāvana, Bh. =Bhādrapada, Āśv.=Āśvina, K.=Kārtika, Mārg. = Mārgaśirsa, P. = Pauṣa, M, = Māgha, Phā. = Phālguna; Śu.or śu.= Śukla, Kr̥. or kr̥.= Kr̥ṣṇa (pakṣa).

_Ardhaśrāvaṇika-vrata_-begin on 1st of Śr. śu.; one month; worship of Pārvati called Ardhaśrāvaṇī; worshipper to observe _ekabhakta_ or _nakta_ for one month; at end to offer dinner to maidens and brāhmaṇas; HV II. 753–754 (from Br.), VP (folios 106-107).

_Ardhodaya-vrata_-This is a vrata of rare occurrence and is said to be equal in holiness to a crore of Sun eclipses. Later medieval digests (e. g. TT 187, KSS 30, NS 211, SmK. 442-445, P. C. 316 ) quote a verse from Mahābhārata 'when in the month of Pauṣa or Māgha there is amāvāsyā with Śravaṇa-nakṣatra and Vyatipāta-yoga, that is called Ardhodaya and Vratārka (folios 348a-350b) states that according to Prayāga-setu of Bhatta Nārāyaṇa it takes place in Pauṣa when amānta reckoning is used and in Māgha when Pūrṇimānta reckoning is used. HV (II. pp. 246–252) quotes from Skanda and adds Sunday to the above requirements and BB (pp. 364-365) adds that the Sun must be in Makara (Capricorn). The TT 187, Vratarka folio 348a and PC 316 read a half verse 'this yoga is commended only if it occurs by day and not so if at night.' KSS 30 provides that if one out of the several requirements (Pauṣa or Māgha Amāvāsyā, Vyatīpāta, Śravaṇa-nakṣatra, Sunday ) is absent, it becomes Mahodaya-parva. In Ardhodaya a bath at Prayāga in the morning is most meritorious, but it is provided that all rivers become like the Ganges at Ardhodaya. The devatās of the vrata are three viz. Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara and they are worshipped in the same order; offerings (of ghee) are made in fire with Paurāṇika mantras, and also with three Vedic mantras viz. 'Prajāpate' (R̥g. X. 121. 10) for Brahmā, 'Idam Viṣṇur' (R̥g. I 22, 17 ) for Viṣṇu, "Tryambakam yajāmahe' (R̥g. VII. 59. 12) for Maheśvara. At the end gifts of cow or money are made. In I. A. vol. 25 p. 345 there is mention of Ardhodaya in śake 1352, Pauṣa, which corresponds to 14th January (Sunday) 1431 A. D. The reference to the distribution of all his wealth by Emperor Harṣavardhana at Prayāga once in five years made by the Chinese traveller Yuan Chwang (vide 7 I. A. 196 at p. 198) is not to Ardhodaya at all, as some suppose. If Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I. pp. 214 and 233 be carefully read this will be clear.

_Alakṣmināśaka-snāna_-On full moon of P. when there is Puṣya nakṣatra, persons should bathe after anointing their bodies with white mustard and drive off _alakṣmi_ (misfortune or poverty) and worship images of Nārāyaṇa, Indra, Moon, Bṛhaspati and Puṣya by bathing them with water in which sarvauṣadhis are put and with homa. Vide SMK 344-345, PC 307, GK 178.

_Alavaṇatr̥tiyā_-On śu. 3 of any month, specially of Vai., Bh. or M.; women alone to perform; fast on 2nd and food on 3rd without salt; Gauri worshipped; it may be for life; KKV 48–51, HV I. 474-477, S. Pr. folio 32a. Vide Bhav., Brāhmaparva 21. 1-22 for this.

_Avatāras_-Tithis of the appearance of (they are called Jayantis), cited in NS 81-82 and KSS 13 as follows: Matsya-Cai. śu. 3; Kūrma-Vai. pūrṇimā; Varāha-Bh. śu. 3; Narasiṁha-Vai. śu. 14; Vāmana-Bh. śu. 12, Paraśurāma-Vai. śu. 3; Rāma Cai. su. 9; Balarāma-Bh. śu. 2; Kr̥ṣṇa-Śr. kr. 8; Buddha-Jy. śu. 2. Some works say Kalkin is yet to appear while others give Śr. śu 6 as Kalkijayanti. Some works differ as to the tithis e. g. some say Matsya appeared on Cai. śu. 5 (and not 3). Vide Sri B. Bhattacharya's paper on the ten avatāras and their birth dates' in volume of studies presented to Dr. F. W. Thomas pp. 31-33 quoted from Śakti-saṅgamatantra I. See under Vaiśākha. The Eran Inscription of Toramāna refers to Varāhāvatāra (Gupta Inscriptions p. 159). Var. 48. 20–22 (q. by both KKV 333 and HV. I 1039 ) state which avatāra out of the well-known ten (including Buddha and Kalkin as separate) is worshipped for what object.

_Avamadina_—a week day on which two tithis end is so called. NS 153 quoting Ratnamālā ("Yatraikaḥ spr̥śate tithidvayā. vasānam vāras-ced-avamadinam taduktam-āryaiḥ"). This is to be avoided when beginning a vrata for the first time, as there is kṣaya of a tithi here.

_Avighnavināyaka or Avighnavrata_-(1) begin on Phā. 4th; tithi; four months; Gaṇeśa worshipped. HV I 524-525, KKV 82-83, both quoting from Varāha 59. 1-10; (2) 4th tithi on both fortnights; three years; Gaṇeśa deity; NA 43 ( from Bhav U).

_Aviyogadvādaśi_-Bh. śu. 12; tithi; worship of Śiva and Gauri, Brahmā and Sāvitri, Viṣṇu and Lakṣmi, the sun and his consort Nikṣubhā. HV I. 1177-1180.

_Aviyogavrata or Aviyogatr̥tīyā_--For women; begin on Mārg. śu. 2 with partaking rice boiled in milk and sugar on 3rd; worship of Gāuri and Śambhu; for a year; worship of images of both made from rice flour under different names in each of twelve months with different flowers; KKV 70-75, HV I 439-444, KR 452-455. Vide Bhav U. 22 for this.

_Avaidhavyaśuklaikādaśī_-Cai. śu. 11; HVI. 1151 (only one verse from Vi. Dh.).

_Avyaṅgasaptami_-Śr. śu. 7; tithi; to be performed every year: 'AVYAṄGA' to be offered to the sun; 'Avyaṅga' is explained in KKV 150 as a hollow strip made of fine white cotton thread, resembling a serpent's slough, 122 fingerbreadths long (the best ), or 120 (middling ) or 108 (the shortest). It seems to have been like the _Kusti_ worn by modern Parsis. Vide Bhav. (Brahma-parva ) 111. 1-8 q. by KKV 149–151 and HV I. 741-743, also V. P (folio 116, which mentions the story of Sāmba in Bhav.). The printed Bhav. uses the word 'abhyaṅga': In Bhav. (Brāhma ) 142. 1-29 we have the legend of Avyaṅgotpatti. In verse 18 occurs the word 'sārasanaḥ' which reminds one of 'Saracen'. Vide Nār. I. 116. 29–31 for AVYAṄGĀKHYA VRATA, the 7th tithi being destroyer of sins if it is conjoined to Hasta-nakṣatra. Avyaṅga appars to be a Sanskrit adaptation of the Avestan 'Aivyaṅghana' (meaning 'girdle'). In the 16 ślokas addressed to the prince Jadi Rāṇā by the Parsis emigrating to India occurs this 'who put on the waist a woollen _kushti_ which is fastened on the _sadra_ (garment), each end of which is like the mouth of a serpent, which is tied into knots at equal distances' ( vide M. M. Murzban's 'Parsis in India 'vol. I at p. 93). It seems probable that this particular form of Sun-worship was imported from Iran or was borrowed from Parsi practices. The Br. S. (59.19 ) states that the priests of Savitr̥̥ should be Magas i.e. Maga or Śākadvipiya brāhmaṇas for whom vide I. A. vol. VIII. 328 and Weber's edition of Magavyakti of Krishnadas Mishra.

_Aśūnyaśayanavrata or Aśūnyaśayanadvitiyā_-on dark 2nd tithi of four months from Śr.; tithi; Lakṣmi and Hari worshipped; occurs in Vi. Dh I. 145. 6-20 and III. 132. 1-12, Vā. 16. 16–29, Āgni 177. 3-12, Bhav. I. 20. 4-28, KKV 41-44 (q. from Bhav U) and 44-46 (from Mat. 71. 2–20=Pād, V. 24, 1-19). The Matsya contains a somewhat different mode; HVI. 366-371 (from Bhav.) and 371-377 (from Bhav U); KR 225-228 ( quotes Bhav I. 20.4-28). This vrata secured _avaidhavya_ to women and _aviyoga_ ( absence of the loss of wife ) to men. Vide S. Pr. (folio 22b ) and SmK 146-148. One of the mantras that occur in both KKV 43 and HV I. 373 is 'Lakṣmyā na śūnyaṁ varada yathā te śayanaṁ sadā । śayyā mamāpyaśūnyāstu tathātra Madhusūdana'॥. KR (p. 228 ) remarks that when it is said that the vrata begins in Śr. Kr̥., the month is _pūrṇimānta_ according to the usage. Mentioned in 'Corpus of Inscriptions in the Teliṅgana Districts of Nizam's Dominions' by Dr. Srinivasachar No. 50 pp. 140-142 of śake 1198 Māgha śu. 10 (1276 A. D.) where Kuppāmbikā wife of a Kākatīya General is said to have performed it.

_Aśūnyavrata_-on dark 2nd tithi of four months from Śr., in which _arghya_ with curds, whole grains of rice and fruits are offered to the moon; if the second tithi is mixed with (viddhā) the third tithi on a certain day the vrata should be performed on that day;P C83.

KV 422 ( quotes mantra from Liṅga ), HK 626 (from Viṣṇu), HV I 862-63 (from Liṅga ) and 875–76 (from Ādityapurāṇa but no mantra ); KR 126-127; R. M (1379-80 ) has the mantra 'tvām-aśoka harābhiṣṭa' and the verse 'Aśoka-kalikāś-cāṣtau 'and BB 1734-35, both of which verses are Gar. I 133. 1-2; PC 109; SMK 94. Vide JRAS for 1900 pp. 545. 791 and for 1901 p. 127 for some remarks. (2) KV 422, KR. 126, KT 463 and other digests state that all tirthas and rivers come to the Brahmaputrā on Cai. śu. 8 and a bath in it on that day yields the same rewards as Vājapeya, when it falls on Wednesday and on Punarvasu.

_Aśokikāṣṭami_-Worship of Umā. NM p. 74 (verses 905-907) states that Aśoka plant is Devi herself.

_Aśvavrata_- a Saṁvatsaravrata; Indra is the deity; Mat. 101.71 q. by KKV 449, HV II. 911 (quotes same 1 1/2 verses from Pad).

_Aṣṭamivratas_-There are about 30 Aṣṭami-vratas, which will be entered at the proper places. General rule is that in the bright half Aṣṭami mixed with Navami is to be preferred and in dark half aṣṭami mixed with saptami is preferred. Vide TT 40, DS 15. For Aṣṭamivratas vide HV I. 811-886, KN 194–228, KKV 225-272, VR 256-319, VKK 38-40, PC. 109-139. There are a few exceptions to above two rules, some of which may be noted at the proper places.

_Asidhārāvrata_-begin on Ās, śu. 15; five days or ten days after As.15, K.15 or for 4 months from Āṣ., or one year or 12 years; one has to sleep on bare ground, to bathe outside house, eat food only in the night, to remain celibate even though sleeping in wife's embrace, curb anger and be devoted to _japa_ and _homa_ to Hari. Different rewards acc. to length of time, the greatest being that after twelve years of this vrata the observer may secure the rulership of the world and on death become one with Janārdana. Vi. Dh. III. 218. 1-25 q. by HV II. 825-827. The word means the vrata is as sharp or difficult as treading on the edge of a sword. The Raghuvaṁśa 13. 67 in referring to Bharata's abstention from enjoying regal splendour out of regard for the exiled Rāma calls it _ugra_ 'iyanti varṣāṇi tayā sahogram-abhyasyatīva vratam āsidhāram'.

_Ahan_-a day. There are several views about the divisions of the day, viz. into two, three, four, five, eight, or fifteen parts. The two are pūrvāhṇa and aparāhṇa ( as in Manu III. 278 ); for three vide notes 257–258 above. Four parts described by Gobhila (q. by KN p. 110 ) are pūrvāhṇa ( for 1 1/2 _prahara_), madhyāhṇa for one prahara, aparāhṇa up to the end of the 3rd prahara and thereafter sāyāhṇa till end of day. For names of five divisions vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 376. In R̥g. V. 76. 3 (utāyātam saṅgave prātarahno) three of the five parts of a day viz. _prātaḥ_, _saṅgava_ and _madhyandina_ are expressly mentioned. Eight divisions of the day are mentioned by Kautilya (I. 19), Dakṣa ( chap. 2) and Katyāyana. Kālidāsa in Vikramorvāśiya II. 1 (sasṭhe bhāge) appears to know this. There are fifteen muhūrtas of the day and fifteen of the night. Vide Br̥hadyogayātrā VI. 2-4 for 15 muhūrtas. As the day and night become long or short at different places (except on the equator) each of the muhūrtas will vary in length to some extent even in the same place in different seasons of the year. Similarly, pūrvāhṇa or prātaḥkāla will be of 7 1/2 muhūrtas if day is divided only in two parts, if into five parts pūrvāhṇa or prātaḥ will comprise only three muhūrtas. The KN (p. 112) remarks that the division into five parts being observed in many Vedic and Smr̥ti texts as the principal division, that division, is the one resorted to in the śāstric passages about positive and negative injunctions. Vide HK 325-329, VKK 18–19, KTV 6, 367.

_Ahiṁsāvrata_—not to eat flesh for a year and then donate a cow and a golden deer; saṁvatsara vrata ; KKV 444, HV II. 865 ( quoting Pad. = Mat. 101. 35).

_Ahirbradhnasnāna_-HV II. pp. 654-655 (from Vi. Dh. ). On a day on which there is Pūrvābhādrapadā-nakṣatra performer to bathe in water from two jars in which are put udumbara leaves, pañcagavya, water with kuśas, sandalwood paste &c; worship of Ahirbradhna, the Sun, Varuṇa, the moon, Rudra, and Viṣṇu. Ahirbudhnya was the presiding deity of Uttarābhādrapadā acc. to Br. S. 97.5, Bhav U. q. by HV II p. 596, KR 560. Vide H. of Dh. II. p. 247, note 563 for the devatās of all nakṣatras. This secured thousands of cows and highest prosperity. Ahirbudhnya is the correct and ancient form. In about ten passages of the R̥gveda 'Ahirbudhnyaḥ' appears to be some deity (probably Agni), vide.R̥g I. 186. 5, II. 31. 6, V. 41, 16, VI. 49. 14, VI, 50. 14; VII. 34. 17, VII. 35. 13, VII. 38. 5, &c. and Nir.

_Utsavas_-Numerous utsavas are mentioned in the Purāṇas and works on vrata. Some of these such as Holikā, Durgotsava have already been described at some length above. A few more will be briefly dealt with at appropriate places in the list. The word ' utsava' occurs in R̥g. I. 100. 8 and I. 102. 1 and is derived from the root _śu_ in the sense of 'urging or inspiring' by Sāyaṇa. Vide 'India Antiqua' (a volume presented to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel) pp 146-153 where Prof. Gonda derives it from root 'su' (rather unconvincingly).

_Udakasaptami_-drinking only a handful of water on 7th tithi gives happiness ; KKV 184, HV I. 726 ( from Bhav).

_Udasevikā_-same as Bhūtamātr̥-utsava. This utsava followed immediately after the Indradhvaja was taken down ( i.e. it took place on Bh. śu. 13 ). It somewhat resembled the wild and mystic Roman Bacchanalia. In HV II 359-365, KKN 413-421 and KR 387-395 this festival is described at length from the Skanda. The origin is traced to Bhairava and a girl called Udasevikā ( whose body was smeared with mud) sprung from the mind of Śiva and Parvati respectively. They became husband and wife. All people become on this day vociferous about sexual matters. Men and women go out like crazy persons, ride asses, bulls and dogs, smear themselves with ashes and mud, even men 100 years old act like boys, become void of shame, utter obscene songs, dress like cowherds, _dombas_, barbers and also went about naked. It is remarkable that Skanda averred that gods and _pitṛ̥s_ did not accept the offerings of a man who did not take part in this festival and remained aloof. There was difference of views about the time when the utsava was to be celebrated. Vide HV II p. 368, and VP ( folios 91-92), which place it in Jy. kr. 1 to 15 ( by pūrṇimānta reckoning).

_Uddālakavrata_-Vide Vas. Dh. S. XI. 76-77; it was prescribed for one who was patitasāvitrīka. See H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 376-377.

Another variety is; HV I. 897-9 and VP folio 187a (from Saurapurāṇa ); mantra is the same as in first variety.

HV I 577-78 (from Skanda ), NS 152, PC 102, VR 221-231, Some works refer it to Āśv.; but when Bh. is mentioned it must be taken to be _amānta_ as the concurrence of Rohiṇi is possible on that supposition alone. The conjunction of so many items is rare, generally found once in 60 years. For reference to Kapilaṣaṣṭhi, vide I. A. vol. 25 p. 345 where a Canarese inscription of Vijayanagar king Kr̥ṣnarāya (in Bh. Kr̥. 6 of śake 1435 corresponding to Tuesday, 20-9-1513) refers to it.

In the Rāmāyaṇa Bharata took a _śapatha_ ( oath ) before Kausalyā "if my elder brother went to the forest with my consent, may the Full Moon tithis of Vai., K., M., honoured even by gods, pass in my case without gifts"; HV II. 137-171 ( quoting Bhav U) contains (on p. 170) this oath of Bharata.

He proclaimed 'śṛṇvantu merthinaḥ sarve pratijñātam mayā tadā । kimicchatha dadāmyeșa kriyamāṇe kimicchake' ॥(Mārk. 122.20 ).

_Kirtivrata_-Saṁvatsaravrata; the performer salutes Aśvattha tree, the Sun and the Ganges, stays in one place restraining his senses, eats only once in the noon; he does so for one year; at end of vrata honours a brāhmaṇa and his wife with gifts of three cows and a golden tree.

_Kumbhaparva_-It occurs once in twelve years. The Sun and Moon should be in Makara rāśi, Jupiter in Taurus (Vṛṣabha), there is amāvāsyā; this is called Kumbhayoga. Bath at Prayāga on this yoga is deemed to be more meritorious than a thousand Aśvamedhas, a hundred Vājapeyas and a lakh of pradakṣiṇās round the earth. Bath at Prayāga and the large concourse of _sādhus_ are the two predominant objects of those who gather there in thousands and sometimes millions. It is in three parts, first is Makarasaṅkrānti, the 2nd ( the chief one and called Pūrṇakumbha ) is _amāvāsyā_ and 3rd is Vasantapañcami. In 1954 A. D. the three dates were 14th January, 3rd February and 7th February. Some hold that the three days are Makarasaṅkrānti, Pauṣa Pūrṇimā and Amāvāsyā. There are other Kumbha-yogas viz. at Haridvāra when Jupiter is in Kumbharāśi and Sun enters Meṣa, at Nasik when Jupiter is in Simha and Sun and Moon in Karkaṭa, at Ujjain when Sun is in Tula and Jupiter in Vṛścika.

The Var., chapters 39-49 deal with ten dvādaśis named after ten avatāras from Matsya to Kalkin and also Padmanābha-dvādaśī. Most of these would be dealt with under their proper names. Agni 188 mentions many Dvādaśīvratas. Eight kinds of Dvādaśīs from Brahmavaivarta have been mentioned by HK 260-263; vide p. 119 above.

_Dvitīyāvratas_-Vide Agni 177. 1-20, KKV 40-48, HV I. 366-393, KN 169-172, TT 29–30, PC 82-84, VR 78-81. The KKV describes only three viz. Puṣhpadvitiyā, Aśūnyaśayana ( two varieties ), Kāntivrata, while HV speaks of eleven. NA speaks of only two viz. Aśūnyaśayana and Yamadvitiyā and remarks that no vrata on the 2nd tithis of other months is well-known. These will be found in their places in this list. The four dvitiyās of Śr., Bh., Āśv. and K. are respectively called Kaluṣā, Nirmalā, Pretasañcārā and Yami.

_Naktavrata_--This is a _divārātrivrata_ and therefore has to be performed on a tithi that covers both day and night (NA 16-17). For the meaning of _nakta_ vide pp. 101-102 above. It consists in eating nothing by day and taking food only at night. Naktavrata may extend over a month, or four months or a year.

_Nakṣatratithi-vāra-graha-yoga-vratānı_-HV II. 588-590 (from Kālottara) deals summarily with certain (about 16) special pūjās to be performed on the conjunction of certain nakṣatras with certain tithis and week-days. A few examples are given here: when on a Sunday there is 14th tithi and Revati nakṣatra or when Aṣṭami and Maghā-nakṣatra are joined, one should worship Śiva and partake of sesame food and this is Ādityavrata that yields health to the performer and his sons and relatives. When there is conjunction of Rohiṇi and the Moon on 14th tithi, or of Aṣṭami and the Moon, that is Candravrata in which Śiva may be worshipped and _naivedya_ of milk and curds be offered and one may subsist on milk and secure fame, health and prosperity. When Revati, Thursday and 14th tithi or Aṣṭami and Puṣya are joined, that is Guruvrata, on which one should subsist on the milk of a _kapilā_ cow mixed with the fluid extracted from Brāhmi plants ; the person becomes master of speech. The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (chap. 90.1-15) deals with what is to be done when the Full Moon days of Mārg. to K. are in conjunction with the nakṣatra which gives the name to the month and the rewards of the observances thereon; vide Dānasāgara pp. 622-626, where V. Dh. is quoted and explained.

_Nakṣatrapuruṣavrata_—begin in Cai.; worship of the image of Vāsudeva; several nakṣatras such as Mūla, Rohiṁi, Aśvini are to be honoured in connection with the feet, the legs, the knees respectively (and so on with the nakṣatras and limbs specified). The ten avatāras and their limbs are to be respectively associated with Āśleṣā, Jyeṣṭhā, Śravaṇa, Puṣya, Svāti and so on; at end of vrata golden image of Hari placed in a jar filled with jaggery is to be donated to a worthy brāhmaṇa as also bed-stead and its gear; he should pray for the continuous life of his wife and on all the days should partake of food without oil and salt. Mat. 54. 3-30 q. by KKV 400-404, HV II. 699-703, KR 87-91; vide Br. S.chap 104.

_Nakṣatra-pūjā-vidhi_-worship of gods as lords of nakṣatras with the fruits reaped, such as of Aśvins, Yama, Agni (as lords of Aśvinī, Bharaṇi, Kr̥ttikā in order), that leads respectively to long life, freedom from accidental death, prosperity: Vā. 80. 1–39, HV II. 594–597 (from Bhav.) = KR 557-560. These relate the lords of nakṣatras to the flowers or substances with which they are to be worshipped and the rewards thereof. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 247 n. 563 for the lords of Nakṣatras in Vedic times and Vi. Dh. I. 83. 13-21.

_Nakṣatraviśeṣe padārthaviśeṣa-niṣedhaḥ_-prohibition of doing certain things on certain nakṣatras). A few examples may be given here. VKK 87-88, TT 28 quote a verse 'one should give up the use of sesame oil on the nakṣatras Citrā, Hasta, and Śravaṇa, shaving on Viśākha and Abhijit, flesh on Mūla, Mr̥gaśiras and Bhādrapadā, sexual intercourse on Maghā, Kr̥ttikā and Uttarā'. This is Vā. 14. 50-51 (with some variations).

_Nakṣatravidhi-vrata_-begin on Mr̥gaśiras; worship of Parvati, identifying her feet with Mūla, her lap with Rohiṇi, Aśvini with her knees and so on with other limbs; on each nakṣatra he fasts and at end of that nakṣatra there is pāraṇā; he offers different food to the brāhmaṇas on each nakṣatra; the flowers and naivedya offered to the deity are different on each nakṣatra; the reward is beauty and _saubhāgya_; KKV 411-414, HV II. 696-698 (from Devīpurāṇa).

_Nakṣatravratāni_-Agni 196, KKV 399-417, HV II. 593-706. KKV deals with only ten, while HV speaks of 33. Vratas connected with the nakṣatras from Aśvini onwards are set out in HV. HK 126-128 and KN 327-328, NA 18 deal with question as to what should be done when a fast is to be observed in a vrata which is concerned with both tithi and nakṣatra. The rule is that the nakṣatra for fast must be existing at the time of sunset or at the time when there is a conjunction of the Moon with midnight (i.e. there is the required nakṣatra at midnight). The first of these two is the principal matter, the 2nd is only next best (anukalpa ). Vide Vi. Dh. I. 60. 26–27 for this rule q. by KN 327, HK 126, VKK 8.

_Nakṣatrahomavidhi_--HV (II. 684-688 ) quotes Garga in prose for the procedure of offering worship and _homa_ to 27 nakṣatras from Aśvini to Revati detailing how many days an illness or danger will last, the deity to be worshipped, the flowers, naivedya, dhūpa, the tree of which fuel sticks are to be offered to Agni, the pūjā mantra, the main material to be offered into fire. One illustrative example is given here. In the case of Rohiṇi, eight days, Prajāpati is dovatā, the naivedya is rice boiled in milk, lotus flowers, dhūpa is the one extracted from the Sarala tree ( a kind of pine ), the pūjā mantra is 'namo brahmaṇe' (Tai. Ār. II. 13, quoted in H. of Dh. II. p. 703 n. 681 ); all _dhānyas_ may be offered in fire. The āhutis are to be 108; the reward is ārogya ( health ).

_Nakṣatrārthavrata_-same as Nakṣatravidhi-vrata above.

_Naditrirātravrata_-When a river is full of flood in Ās., a person should collect the water in a dark jar, take it home, then next mobning he should bathe in the river and worship the jar, observe fast for three days or one or only ekabhakta, keep a lamp continuously burning, take the name of the river and Varuṇa, offer arghya, fruits, naivedya &c. and pray to Govinda; this vrata for three years; then donate cow etc.; he secures progeny and saubhāgya.

II. 462 quoting Vi. Dh. III. 163. 1-7; vide Mat. 121. 40-41, Vāyu 47. 38–39 for the seven streams of the Ganges; (2) HV I. 792 (quoting one verse from Vi. Dh.); by worshipping Sarasvati one secures soven kinds of knowledge.

U.). Vide above p. 66 (pūrṇamāṣad-aṇ &c.). When the Moon and Jupiter are seen together (in the same nakṣatra) on a Full Moon day, that Paurṇamāsi is called great (Mahā), gifts and fasts on such a paurṇamāsi yield inexhaustible merit (V.

On Āṣ. pūrṇimā, ascetics (_yatis_) are to shave their heads and not to shave during _cāturmāsya_, they are to stay in one place for four or two months from Āṣāḍhi and perform Vyāsapūjā (PC 284); on Śr. pūrṇimā _Upākarma_; on Bh.

Dh. (90.3-5) provides that if on Full Moon of P. there is Puṣya nakṣatra and a man bathes Vāsudeva image in ghee and himself applies white mustard paste to his body and bathes with water mixed with _sarvauṣadhi_ and fragrant things and worships the image with mantras of Viṣṇu, Indra and Bṛhaspati he prospers (q. by KR 484).

_Pauṣavratas_-KR 474-486, VKK 487-490, NS 211-12, SmK 432-439; some matters are briefly mentioned here. Stream of clarified butter in P. on Śiva (liṅga) from a vessel with song, dance and instrumental music and with illuminations makes the performer free from all sins and takes him to Śivaloka (KR 478); on P. śu. 8th with Wednesday, bath, japa, homa, feeding brāhmaṇas in worship of Śiva yields merit thousands of times (NS 211); fast on P. 9th of both _pakṣas_ and worship of Durgā thrice in the day, nakta for whole month and bathing Durgā image in ghee, feeding eight maidens and worship of Durgā image made of flour, lead a man to Durgā-loka (KR 477 from Bhav.).

_Pauṣṭika_-Br̥. S. 2 enumerates among the qualifications of the sāṁvatsara ( astrologer) that he should be well-versed in the śāntika and pauṣṭike rites. The difference between the two is: Pauṣṭika rites are homa and the like performed for longevity, while Śāntika rites are homa and the like performed for averting threatened evil influence of planets and danger foreboded by unusual occurrences like comets, meteor showers &c.; NA 48. KKN 254 states that Śanti means the removal of worldly calamities by means of acts in accordance with Dharma (or Dharmaśāstra ).

_Prajāpativrata_-in the Saṅkhāyana Br. VI, 6 it is said 'he should not see the Sun rising or setting'. These rules are called Prajāpativrata by Śabara on Jai. IV. I 3 and he declares that they are 'puruṣārtha' and not 'kratvartha'; (2) In the Praśṇopaniṣad I. 13 and 15 it is said 'day is the prāṇa and the night the food of Prajāpati and those who have sexual intercourse by day attack prāṇa while those that have it by night are observing brahmacarya; that those who observe the Prajāpati-vrata produce children (a son and a daughter).' In Praśṇa I. 15 Prajāpativrata means indulging in sexual intercourse only at night; this meaning is different from that given by Śabara.

_Pratipad-vratas_--Agni 176 (only two vratas), KKV 35-40, HV I. 335-365; KN 140–149, PC 56-81, VR 49-78, HK 614 (quoting Bhav.) say the 1st tithis of Cai., K. and Āśv. are the holiest (also HV II. 350). If Pratipad is _viddhā_ all dānas should be performed on 1st mixed with 2nd (KN 140).

This is quoted by KR 149 from RM and by VKK 240 (from Bhav.); V. Dh. 64. 8 directs that one who undertakes prātaḥsnāna must bathe when he sees eastern quarter suffused with the rays of Aruṇa.

_Pretacaturdaśī_—on 14 of K. kr̥., the vrata is begun to be performed at night; if in addition there is Tuesday and Citrā nakṣatra, the merit is far greater; Śiva is deity; if 14th is viddhā, the day on which 14th exists at night is to be preferred; fast on 14th and worship of Śiva and dinner to devotees of Śiva and gifts; by bath in Ganges on this tithi, one becomes free from all sins; one should whirl over one's head a twig of apāmārga plant and engage in tarpaṇa of Yama uttering his names (14 in all ); one should light rows of lamps on a river, in temples of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, houses where four roads meet; the performer reaches Śivaloka together with 21 generations of his family; on this tithi firebrands are lighted for persons of the family that died by wounds from arms and for others on amāvāsyā; the performer listens to the story called Pretopākhyāna ( of five _pretas_ which a brāhmaṇa met in a desert ) set out from Saṁvatsarapradipa (in VKK 461-467 ) which was narrated by Bhiṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira about the actions by which a man is reduced to the condition of a _preta_ (a disembodied spirit, a ghost), and the actions which relieve him from that condition; the performer should also partake of 14 vegetables that are enumerated in Kṛtyacintāmani set out in Introduction (p.

_Bhimadvādaśi_-(1) It was first imparted to Bhima, one of the Pāndavas, by Vāsudeva and came to be known by his name; this was formerly called Kalyāṇini. It is elaborately described in Mat. 69. 19-65 (which also occur in Pad. V. 23), most of which are q. by KKV 354-359 (from Mat.) and HV I. 1044-1049 (from Pad.); on 10th of M. śu. bath with ghee applied to the body and worship of Viṣṇu with the words (namo Nārāyaṇāya), the various limbs of Viṣṇu being honoured with different names (Kr̥ṣṇa, Dāmodara &c.), worship of Garuḍa, of Śiva, Gaṇeśa; total fast on 11th; on 12th bathe in a river and raise maṇḍapa in front of house; hang a jar full of water from a _toraṇa_ with a small hole at the bottom and take the drops on one's hand the whole night; _homa_ through four priests learned in Ṛgveda, Rudra-japa by four Yajurvedins and _sāmans_ to be sung by Sāmavedins; these twelve priests to be honoured with rings, garments &c.; on next tithi donate 13 cows; after priests go he should say 'May Keśava be pleased, and Viṣṇu is the heart of Śiva and Śiva is the heart of Viṣṇu'; should listen to _itihāsa_ and _purāṇa_; vide Gar. I. 127 for this; (2) on M. śu. 12; this was imparted by Pulastya to Bhima, king of Vidarbha and father of Damayanti wife of Nala: arrangements as in the preceding; performer freed from all sins; this vrata is superior to Vājapeya and Atirātra &c. HV. 1049–1056 ( from Bhav. U.).

_Bhimavrata_-one who having fasted for a month donates at end a fine cow reaches the world of Viṣṇu; Mat. 101. 51 q. by KKV 446, HV II. 884 (from Pad. ).

_Bhimaikādaśī_--M. śu. 11th joined with Puṣya or without it is very sacred and dear to Viṣṇu. Dhaumya describes to Bhima in Pad. VI. 239. 28 ff.

_Bhiṣmapañcaka_--For five days from 11th tithi of K. śu.; performer bathes three times applying pañcāmṛta, pañcagavya and water mixed with sandalwood paste; tarpaṇa of pitṛs with yava, rice and sesame; 108 times repeat the mantra 'om namo Vāsudevāyā' at worship and when performing homa offer sesame, yava and rice mixed with ghee with mantra of six letters 'om namo Viṣṇave'; this procedure to be followed for five days; on the 1st to 5th day the feet, knees, navel, shoulders and head of Hari should respectively be worshipped with lotuses, bilva leaves, bhṛṅgāraka, (on 4th day ) _bāṇa_, _bilva_ and Jayā, Mālati; on 11th to 14th he should respectively partake of cow-dung, cow urine, milk and curds for purifying the body; then on 5th day performer to feast brāhmaṇas and give gifts; the performer's sins are all wiped out; HV II, 336-341 (from Nār. and Bhav. U., the first saying that Bhiṣma learnt it from Kr̥ṣṇa, while the latter makes Kr̥ṣṇa declare that he learnt it from Bhiṣma when the veteran hero was lying on his bed of arrows); Bhav. U. allows the performer to eat vegetables and the food of ascetics. KV 324 cites the last verse occurring in HV II. 34 from Bhav. U. Later medieval works like NS 204, SM 158-159, SmK 386 add (from Pad.) that _arghya_ and water should be offered to Bhiṣma by men of all varṇas and the tarpaṇa mantra is note-worthy 'Vaiyāghra-padya gotrāya Sāṅkṛtyapravarāya ca। Gaṅgā-putrāya Bhīṣmāya pradāsyeham tilodakam ॥ aputrāya dadāmyetat salilam Bhiṣmavarmaṇe।'. These occur in BB p. 364 verses 1714-15 and the verse 'Vaiyāghra' occurs in RM (vide ABORI vol. 36 p. 332 ) and in HK 628. By doing this a man becomes free from sins. Vide Agni 205. 1-9, Gar. I. 123. 3-11, Pad. VI. 125. 29–82 that contain a very elaborate description of this vrata.

_Bhiṣmāṣṭamī_-on M. śu. 8; offer water and śrāddha every year to Bhīṣma who died a bachelor; he who does so becomes free from sins committed in one year and secures progeny; HK 628-29, VKK 503, TT 58, NS 221, SM 61. One whose father is alive also can offer water to Bhīṣma (SM 61 ). This tithi is probably based on Anuśāsanaparva 167, 28 ( Māghoyaṁ samanuprāpto ... tribhāgaśeṣah pakṣoyam śuklo bhavitumarhati). With great respect to Prof. P. C. SenGupta I must say that his interpretation of 'samanuprāpta' as 'samanupraviṣta' is quite wrong and unwarranted and it is not possible to accept his conclusion that Bhisma died on 8th of dark half of Māgha and not on 8th of bright half. Vide his paper in JASB vol. XX No. 1 ( Letters ) pp. 39-41 (1954). The Bhujabalanibandha p. 364 has two verses, which are quoted in TT, NS and other works ' शुक्लाष्टम्यां तु माघस्य दद्याद् भीष्माय यो जलम् । संवत्सरकृतं पापं तत्क्षणादेव नश्यति ॥ वैयाघ्रपद्य गोत्राय सांकृतिप्रवराय च । अपुत्राय ददाम्येतत्सलिलं भीष्मवर्मणे ॥'. Even brāhmaṇas were called upon to offer water to the noble kṣatriya warrior Bhīṣma.

Bhuvaneśvara-yātrās-The fourteen yātrās of Bhuvaneśvara are

enumerated and described (such as Prathamāṣṭami, Prāvā

raṣaṣṭhi, Puṣyasnāna, Ājyakambala ) in GK 190–194. Bhūtacaturdasi-Same as Pretacaturdaśi pp. 351-52 above; vide

HV II. 359-365 (from Skanda ). Bhutamātryut sava–From 1st to pūrṇimā of Jy.; HV II. 365–370.

Bame as Udasevikā. The Sarasvatikanthābharaṇa of Bhoja (V.94) on Poetics mentions it among krīdās. Bhrātsbhāodā, Bhūtamātā and Udasevikā are three names of one utsava

(HV II. 367 ). Bhūbhājanavrata-It is a samvatsara vrata; the man who for

one year takes his food on bare ground ( not in a plate or on a leaf like that of plantain) after presenting it to pitṛs

HV I. 1172. Bhaimi-ekādaśī-when on M. śu. 11 there is Moon in Mrgasirsa

nakṣatra, one should observe fast and on 12th the performer should be sattili i. e. he should bathe with water mixed with sesame, rub sesame paste on his body, offer sesame in fire, drink water mixed with sesame, make gift of sesame and eat them; if a person fasts on this ekādaśī called 'Bhima tithi' he reaches Viṣṇuloka; Ekādaśītattva p. 101, TT

113–114, VKK 504. Bhairavajayantı-K. kr. 8 is known as Kālāṣṭami; fast on that

tithi and jāgara; worship of Bhairava for four praharas of the night and jāgara in listening to and narrating legends about Śiva; the performer becomes free from sins and becomes a good devotee of Śiva; this is obligatory on persons

dwelling in Kāśī; SM 60-61, SMK 427-429, PC 138. Bhogasaṅkrāntivrata-on Saṅkranti day call together women

and give them saffron, lampblack collyrium, vermilion, flowers, scents, tambūla and camphor, fruits and also to their husbands; feed them and present pair of garments; on each saṅkrānti for one year, at end worship the Sun and donate a cow to brāhmaṇa who has a wife; performer secures

with red cloth and saffron used as unguent; offer flowers and naivedya and donate to a brāhmaṇa householder with a mantra 'though you are Kujanmā still the wise call you Maogala'. There is a pun on Kujanmā that has two senses (1) born on an inauspicious day', (2) born of the earth'. As Mars is red in appearance, copper, red cloth and saffron are used to match his colour; HV II. 567 (from Bhav. U.); (2) worship Mars on Tuesday; repeat in the morning the several names of Mars ( 21 in all, such as Mangala, Kuja, Lohita, favouring Sāmayedins, Yama); draw a triangular figure with a hole in the middle and draw three names ( Āra, Vakra, Kuja ) with saffron and red sandalwood paste on each angle; Mars was born in Ujjayini in a Bhāradvāja family and rides a ram; if a man performs this vrata throughout life he becomes prosperous, has sons and grandsons and reaches the world of the planets; HV II. 568-574 (from Pad.); VKD 443-451 has a far more elaborate procedure of

Bhaumavāra-vratapūjā.

Bhrūtrdvitiya--on K. śu. 2; it is also called Yamadvitiyā because

in ancient times Yamunā treated her brother Yama to a dinner on this day; some works like KT 453, Vratārka, VR 98-101 combine the two viz. worship of Yama and dining

at one's sister's house. Vide pp. 209-210 above for the latter. Mangala--Acc. to Atharvapaparisista q. by HV II, 626 brāhmaṇa,

cow, fire, land, mustard, clarified butter, sami, grains of rice and barley are eight auspicious things. Dronaparva 127. 14 speaks of eight mangalas; Drona 82, 20-22 contains a much longer list. Vā 14. 36-37 enumerate several things as auspicious which should be touched when going out of one's house viz. dūrvā, clarified butter, curds, jar full of water, cow with calf, bull, gold, clay, cow dung, svastika, aksata grains, oil, honey, brāhmaṇa maidens, white flowers, sami, fire, Sun's disc, sandalwood and aśvattha tree (q. by Sm. C. I. p. 168) Vide Parāśara XII. 47, Viṣṇudharmottara

II. 163. 18 ff. for other lists of mangala objects. Mangala-candikāpūjā- VKK (552-558 ) gives an elaborate

procedure ; Mangalacandikā is called Lalitakāntā; the mantra (i.e. Lalitā-gāyatri) for her worship is : Nārāyaṇyai vidmahe tvām Caṇḍikāyai tu dhimahi i tan-no Lalita kānteti tataḥ paścāt pracodayāt II); worship on 8th and 9th tithis; she may be worshipped on a piece of cloth or as anList of vratas

Moon in Maghā it is called Mahāmāghi, acc. to R. M. 1366 ( vide ABORI. vol. 36 p. 331 for three verses on Māghisnāna) and it adds that in Māgha waters exclaim when the Sun is just risen 'what great sinner, whether a drinker of surā or murderer of a brāhmaṇa, shall we purify', This verse is q. by VKK 490 from Bhav. and by Smk 439 (from Pad.); PC ( 313-314) says that when Saturn is in Meṣa (Ram), the Moon and Jupiter in Simha (Lion) and the Sun is in Śravaṇa-nakṣatra then it is Mahāmāghi. Vide NS 221 for other views. This verse emphasizes the importance of Māghasnāna at Prayāga and other holy rivers and in holy tanks in early morning for the removal of sins, Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 617 for Māghasnāna. In Tamil country 'Makha' is an annual temple festival and Maha makha occurs once in twelve years, when a great meļā is held at Kumbhakonam for a bath in a tank there called maha magha tank, the meļā being comparable to the Kumbhamelā at Prayāga. This festival is popularly known as 'Mamangam' and takes place when the Full Moon is in Maghānakṣatra and Jupiter is in Maghā or in the sign of Lion. It fell on 23th February in 1955 according to south Indian Almanacs. It is reported that about a million people took a bath this year in eight to ten hours from 2 A. M. in the Mahamakham tank at Kumbhakopam from which muddy water was pumped out and in which fresh water from the Kāverī river was made to flow.

It is surprising that hardly any medieval digest refers either to the Mahāmakham festival or the Kumbha meļā. The great emperor Harsa used to hold once every five years a great meļā at Prayāga on the great sandy plain to the west of the sargam on the site where the Kumbhameļā is held in modern times and distributed the

accumulations in his treasury. Mahāmārgasirṣi-Vide above under Kārtika for prefixing 'Mahā'.

Vide N. S. pp. 153–154, where a similar period is prescribed but it is said that one should, if beginning this vrata for the first time, avoid four doṣas, viz. there should not be avamadina, the tithi should not be tryabasprk, should not be mixed with 9th tithi, nor should the Sun be in the half of Hasta nakṣatra. In Mahārāstra the pūjā of Mahālakṣml is performed on Āś. śu. 8th by young married women at noon and at night all married women join in worship and hold big empty jars in their hands, breathe into them and bend their bodies in various ways; P.C. (pp. 129-132) has a long discussion on this. According to it, this vrata

is for both men and women. Mahālaksmirrata-begin on Bh. śu. 8 before the Sun passes into

Kanyā sign ( Virgo ) the worship of Mahālakṣmi and finish it on 8th tithi ( following ) while the Sun is in the first half of Kanyā (i. e. in 16 days ); begin if possible when the Moon is in Jyestbā-nakṣatra; for 16 years; for men and women number 16 is predominant here as to flowers and fruits &c.; the performer should wear on his right hand aList of vratas

439-513, GK 37-41. There are several important vratas in Māgha such as Tilacaturthi, Rathasaptamī, Bhiṣmāṣṭami which would be separately mentioned in this list. A few small matters may be briefly disposed off here. M. śu. 4 is called Umācaturthī because Gauri is to be worshipped by men and specially by women with Kunda and other flowers, with offerings of jaggery, salt, yāvaka and one should honour women who are not widows, brāhmaṇas and cows (KKN 437-38, KR 503 ); on M. kr. 12th Yama produced sesame and Daśaratha brought them to the earth and sowed them and Viṣṇu was made lord of sesame by the gods, hence one should fast on that day and worship Hari with sesame, offer homa with sesame, donate them and eat them (V. Dh. 90. 19, KKN 435-6, KR 495-96); on M. amāvāsyā, if it is present on Monday morning, men and particularly women in Tamil country circumbulate the aśrattha tree and make

gifts. Māghasaptami-on M. su. 7; one should bathe at arunodaya in a

river or other running water after placing on his head seven leaves of the badara tree and seven of the arka plant; then offer arghya to the Sun with water mixed with seven badara fruit, arka leaves, rice, sesame, dūrvā, akṣatas and sandal wood, bow to Saptami as Devi, then to the Sun. Some held that this snāna and Māghasnāna were not separate, while

others held that the two were quite separate; KR 509, VKK

· 499-502, KT 459, RM (ABORI vol. 36 p. 332, three verses ). Māghasnāna—bath in Māgha in the Ganges or in any other

fine stream in the early morning is highly eulogised from

early times. The best time is dawn when the nakṣatras are still visible, next best is the time when stars are visible but the Sun is not actually risen and the inferior time is after the Sun rises. The beginning for the month's bathing should be made on the 11th of P. śu. or on P. pūrṇimā (according to the pūrṇimānta reckoning) and the vrata (for one month ) is to be finished on the 12th of M. śu. or pūrṇimā; some bring it in line with the Saura reckon ing by providing that bath when the Sun is in Makara ( Capricorn) in Māgha in the morning leads sinners to heaven (VKK 491 quoting Pad.); all men and women are entitled to engage in it. The most meritorious Māgha snāna is at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā. Vide for details, Pad.

Some of the less important matters may be noted here. In Kṛtayuga the gods began the year on the first tithi of Mārg, and the sage Kāśyapa created the beautiful Kāśmira country; therefore celebration should be held on it (KR 452 ); Mārg. su. 12 a person should fast on the 12th tithi on each dyādaśī for a year from Mārg. to K. and should on each dyādaśī dwell on one of the twelve names of Viṣṇu from Keśava to Dāmodara and offer worship; he becomes jātismara (one

A golden, silver or clay image of Durgā is to be worshipped, so also the weapons and symbols of royalty with mantras; there is a legend that there was a demon named Loha who was shattered into pieces by the gods and all the iron and steel in the world is produced from his limbs. Lohābhisāra means putting forth or brandishing iron or steel weapons ('Lohābhihārostrabhr tām rājñām nirājano vidhih' Amarakośa ). When a king started on an invasion the ceremony of sprinkling sacred water on him or waving lights before him was performed and that was called Lohābhisārika-karma. In Udyogaparva 160.93 we read 'Lohābhisāro nirvittah' &c. Nilakantha explains that it comprises waving of lights before weapons and invoking deities.

be taken on certain occasions, such as crossing a river (when one is to remember Matsya, Kūrma and Varāha), or when the planets or nakṣatras are unfavourable or when one is in danger from robbers and tigers &c. ( remember name Nșsiṁha ); Vi. Dh. III. 124 sets out the names of Viṣṇu to be uttered in months from Cai., or on weekdays, nakṣatras, tithis; chap. 125 deals with the names to be taken

when visiting certain holy places, countries &c. Viṣṇutrimārtivrata-Viṣṇu has three forms or manifestations

viz. Vāyu, the Moon and the Sun; these protect all the three worlds; they are also inside the bodies of men as vāta, pitta (bile ) and kapha (phlegm); in this way Viṣṇu has three palpable forms; worship Him on Jy. śu. 3 observing a fast; in early morning worship Vāyu, offer at midday homa in Agni with yavas and sesame, at sunset worship the Moon in water; for a year (on each 3rd of su.); worshipper reaches heaven; if he performs for three years, he is in heaven for

of trees. Mat. 59 ( verses 1-20 same as Pad. V. 24. 192–211 ) contains the procedure of tree festival. It is briefly as follows:-trees in a garden should be sprinkled with sarvaușadhi water, decked with fragrant powder and flowers and cloth should be wound round them; the trees should be pierced with a golden needle (imitating karnavedha) and collyrium applied to them with a golden pencil; on the platforms of trees seven or eight golden fruits should be placed, jars containing pieces of gold should be established under the trees: homa to be offered to Indra, Lokapālas and Vanaspati; a milch cow covered with white cloth decked with gold ornaments and having horns tipped with gold should be let loose from the midst of trees; the performer (owner of the trees) should honour all priests with gifts of cows, golden chains, rings, clothes &c. and feed brāhmaṇas with a dinner full of milk for four days; homa with yavas, black sesame and mustard and palāśa fuel sticks and festival on 4th day; performer reaps all desires. Mat. 154. 512 states that a son is equal to ten deep reservoirs of water and a tree planted is equal to ten sons. It is said by Var. (172. 36-37 ) that just as a good son saves his family, so a tree laden with flowers and fruits saves its owner from falling into hell, and that one who plants five mango trees does not go to Hell; Vi. Dh. (III. 297. 13) remarks about trees' a single tree nurtured by





TULU

a man performs what a son would do in that it gratifies gods with its flowers, travellers with its shade, men with

its fruits; there is no fall in hell for the planter of a tree.' Vrntāka-tyāga-vidhimit involves the abstention from eating

vrntāka (fruit of egg-plant) for a life-time or a year or six or three months; fast on Bharaṇi or Maghā nakṣatra for one night; invoke the presence of Yama, Kāla, Citragupta, Mrtyu and Prajāpati on an altar and worship with gandha &c.; homa with sesame and ghee with svāhā to Yama, Nila, Nilakantha, Yamarāja, Citragupta, Vaivasyata ; 108 õhutis; gift of a vṛntāka made of gold, dark cow and bull, finger rings, ear-rings, umbrella, sandals, a pair of dark garments and dark blanket; dinner to brāhmaṇas who pronounce blessings; he who gives up vṛntāka for life goes to Viṣpu loka; one who performs this for a year or a month oven does not see the city of Yama; it is a prakirnaka vrata;

HV II. 909–910 ( from Bhay. U.). Vīndāvanadvādaśimon K. śu. 12 observed in Tamil lands. Vrṣabhavrata-(1) fast on 7th śu.; on 8th gift of a bull covered

Dh. III, 141.

1-7). Veśyāvrala-HV II. pp. 541-548 (quoting Bhav. U.) deals with

this vrata and contains the startling story narrated by Kr̥ṣṇa to Yudhisthira that the former cursed his 16000 wives, when he noticed their erotic emotion roused by the charms of his son Sāmba, that after his death dasyus would kidnap them and the story of a prior curse pronounced by sage Nārada on Apsarases who proudly did not bow to him that they would have Nārāyaṇa as their husband but that ultimately they would be kidnapped by robbers and become Veśyās ( prostitutes ). The long and short of this story is that they were advised to follow the profession in palaces and temples, that they should not love any male who has no wealth, but that they should have as their sole object wealth, whether the man who approached them was hand some or ugly. It is further stated that they should make gifts of cows, fields, gold to brāhmaṇas, should bathe with sarvauṣadhi water when on a Sunday there is Hasta, Puṣya or Punarvasu nakṣatra and offer worship to Kāmadeva from the feet to the head, that they should worship Cupid as Viṣṇu, honour a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda with gift of a prastha of husked rice grains and render their person to him on Sunday as above for a year and in the 13th month make a gift of bedstead, gold chain and an image of Kāmadeva; this is the vrata for all Veśyās; this is vāravrata; Ananga (god of love) is devatā; KKV (27-31) has this

vrata and calls it Veśyādityavārānangadāna-vrata. Vaikunthacaturdasi-1) K. Śu. 14 is called Vaikuntha; if

worship of Viṣṇu is to be done it should take place at night; NS 206; (2) on K, śu. 14 in the cyclic year Hemalamba at the time of Arunodaya and on Brāhma muhūrta Lord Viśveśvara himself is said to have bathed in Manikarnikā at Banaras, performed Pāśupatavrata and together with Umā worshipped Viśveśvara and established Viøvesvara; NS 206, SmK 388-389, PC 246-247.

Vaitaraṇīvrata--Marg. kr. 11th tithi is called Vaitarani; one

should undertake niyamas ( restrictions) for this vrata on that tithi; at night he should worship a dark cow from its

front foot to its tail; apply sandalwood paste to its body, wash its feet and horns with water scented with sandalwood paste and worship its limbs with Paurānika mantras; since one crosses the Vaitarapi river of the nether world by means of a cow, so this ekādaśī on which cow is honoured is so called; this vrata is for one year in three periods of four months, in which naivedya of boiled rice, of cooked barley and of pāyasa is offered respectively in 4 months from Mārg., in four months from Cai. and in 4 months from Sr.; one third of each naivedya is to be given to the cow, to the priest and to the performer; at end of one year gift of bedstead and a golden cow to the priest and one drona of iron; HV I. 1110-1112 (from Bhav.

In this month morning bath, particularly in holy rivers, is specially commended along with baths when the Sun is in Tula ( Balance ) or Makara (Capricorn).

When the sixth is mixed up with 5th or 7th the general rule is that in the case of vratas and fasts sixth mixed with the 7th is to be chosen except in the case of Skandaṣaṣṭhi where sixth mixed with 5th is to be preferred (KN 190, NA 48, SM 42, PC 100-101 ); the sixth tithi is dear to Kārtikeya (or Skanda ) who was born on it and became the commander-in-chief of the gods on it; Bhav. I. 39. 1-13, HK 622 ( quoting Brah.), KKN 382-383.

One or two special matters may be noted. Skanda is the lord of 6th tithi and is to be worshipped on every 6th tithi with fragrant flowers, lamps, garments, crows as toys, bell, chowries and mirror; Kārtikeya is specially to be always worshipped by kings with campaka flowers and no other god ( KR 276 ); 6th of Mārg. śu. is called Mahāṣaṣṭhi (HK 623-624). Vide Nār. I. 45. 1-51 for Şasthivrata in the

X. 90), Nār. and numerous Paurānika mantras are relied upon and 16 upacāras offered; Gaṇeśa is worshipped with 21 names and the same number of dūrvā tendrils, leaves of plants (such as Bhrnyarāja,'bilra, badarī, dhattūra, sami and flowers (red); there is also worship with 108 names of Ganapati; at end five modakas to be offered to the priest and dakṣinā; it is said that Vyāsa narrated this vrata to Yudhisthira. Saṅkasta appears to mean distress or cala mity. "Kasta' means 'kleśa' and the prefixing of 'sam'

makes it a little more emphatic. Saṅkrāntivratas-Vide HV 727-743 ( 16 in all ), HK 407-438,

III, 201, 1-5. Salya-nārāyanavrata-very popular in Bengal and Mahārāstra:

described in Bhaviṣya (Pratisargaparva) chap. 24–29; M. M. Hara Prasad Shastri in cat. of mss in the Asiatic Society's Library, Calcutta, vol. V. preface p. LXV says that the worship of Satyanārāyaṇa (ms. No. 3370 ) has a Maha modan origin. It was originally (and even now in many places) called 'Satyapirer pūjā! It occurs in the Revā khaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa (Vangavāsi ed.) but does not occur in the Venk. Press edition. Vide also JBORS vol. XVI at p. 328 where the same scholar says that the Mahomedan custom of offering 'Sirni' to Satyapir was adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanārāyana. This is a vrata very popular among lower middle-class people and women. Vide 1. A. vol. 3 pp. 83-85 for stories current in Bengal about this vrata. It is said that Nārada was told about this vrata by Viṣṇu himself. On any day a man worships Satyanārāyaṇa and offers naivedya of 11 quantity (such as 11 ser or maund) of plantains, ghee, milk and wheat flour (or rice flour), jaggery or sugar; all these to be mixed up for naivedya ; performer should listen to the stories and partake of the prasāda; jāgara with songs, music, dance; then people go to their houses; this yields all desired objects; stories about a brāhmaṇa who performed this vrata every month, of a vendor of wood, of a trader named Sadhu with a ship full of merchandise and costly things and his daughter Kalāvati. In these stories Satyanārāyana is represented as very jealous and vindictive. The stories are said to have been

taken from Skandapurāṇa, Revā-khaṇḍa. Sadāvrata-otherwise called 'annadānamāhātmya'. HV II.

469-475 quoting Bhay. U. wherein Kr̥ṣṇa narrates to Yudhisthira the importance of giving food to others and refers to the words of Rāma to Laksmana that they suffered exile in a forest because of not feeding brāhmaṇas, that king Sveta suffered pangs of hunger even when in heaven and was told by Brahma that his plight was due to his not having fed hungry persons. The word literally means 'vrata (i. e. giving food ) always'. In modern times it is often pronounced and written as 'Sadāvarta' or 'Sadabarta' or 'Sadā varat'; vide Murarji v. Nenbai I. L. R. 17. Bom. 351 for ā bequest of rents for establishing a 'sadā varat'. HV II

438





471 quotes a verse saying that 'food is the very life of beings, it is their vigour, strength and happiness and there fore the donor of food is declared to be the giver of every thing'. The importance of giving food is stressed in the exordium'atithidovo bhava'in Tai. Up. I. 11. 2; vide also

before sunrise and after sunset and it was provided that one should not engage in four actions in that period, viz. eating, sexual intercourse, sleep, Vedic study; HK 694-97, PC 46; Utpala on Brhaj-jātaka VII, 1 quotes Varāha that it is the time after half the sun's disc has gone down till appearance of stars and morning twilight is from the east having light

till half the sun's disc appears. Saptadvipavrata-begin on Cai. śu. 1st and worship for seven

It should be performed in the 7th month after a child is born to a woman who lost an infant child or on a '7th tithi in su., but tithi of the birth should be avoided; offer to the Sun and Rudra and the Mātrs specially oblations of rice with milk, repeat hymn to the Sun (R̥g.

Dh.). The above seven appear to be the names or branches of river Sarasvati and therefore Sārasvata appears to be the propor name and not 'Saptasāgaravrata', Vide Vi. Dh. III. 164. 1-7 for these soven rivers and this vrata being called Sarasvata.

Saptasundaraka-vrata-worship of Pārvatī under seven names,

Haravrata-on 8th tithi draw an image of lotus leaf and

worship Hara and perform homa with streams of ghee and

fuel-sticks; HV I. 881 ( from Bhav.). Harikūlīvrata-on 3rd tithi of Bh. śu. worship of Kāli on the

sprouts of seven dhānyas sown in a winnowing basket; it is carried at night by women whose husbands are alive to a reservoir of water and discharged therein; HV I. 435-439 (from Bhav. U. 20. 1-28). The story is that Kāli was daughter of Daksa, was given in marriage to Mahādeva and was dark in complexion. Once in an assembly of gods Mahādeva called her as dark as collyrium. She was angered, left her complexion on a grassy plot and threw herself into fire. She was born again as Gauri and became Mahādeva's wife. The dark complexion laid aside by Kāli became Kātyāyani, who helped gods in their undertakings. The gods bestowed on her the boon that those men or women who would worship Kāli existing in groen grass would have happiness, long life and saubhāgya. The printed HV labels it Harikāli, but no question about Hari (meaning Viṣṇu) arises here. Hari here probably simply means 'tawny' (i.e.

Kāli who was once brown or tawny and not fair ). Harikridāśayana or Harikridayana-on K. or Vai. 12th; tithi

Viṣṇu in K. Vide pp. 109-111 above. Harirāsara-The day of Hari. There is a divergence of views

on this point; VKK 14 holds that Ekādaśī is really the day of Hari and not dvādaśī. Gar. I. 127. 12 and Nāradapurāṇa II. 24. 6 and 9 call Ekādaśī Harivāsara; KSS 43 quotes Mat. to the effect that if Āṣ. śu. 12th falls on Wednesday and has Anurādhā nakṣatra and if Bh, śu. 12 falls on Wednes

(Soc. I, Ch. XIII

day and has Śravaṇa nakṣatra and if K. śu. 12 falls on Wednesday and has Revati nakṣatra, these are called

Harivāsara. Smk 29 holds that Dyādaśī is Haritithi. Harivrata-(1) a person should practise ekabhakta on Pūrṇimā

and Amāvāsyā; he does not go to Hell; on those tithis he should worship Hari with 'pupyāhavācana' and words like
