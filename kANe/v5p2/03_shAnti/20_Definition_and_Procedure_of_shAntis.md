ŚĀNTI (Propitiatory rites for averting a deity's wrath, 

a calamity or unlucky event), 

CHAPTER XX 

Vedic meaning and procedure of Sāntis 

The word śānti is derived from the root 'sam', which has several meanings (such as 'to stop', 'to be appeased', 'to kill' rarely) and belongs to the 4th conjugation and also to the 9th. The word Śānti itself does not occur in the Rgveda, but it occurs in the Atharvaveda and the Vājasaneya Samhitā. The root 

sam', its several forms and derivatives and the indeclinable particle sam' occur hundreds of times even in the Rgveda. The word 'sam' is often conjoined in the Rgveda to'yoh' either as 'samyoh' (Rg. I. 93.7, I. 106.5, III 17.3, III, 18.4, IV. 12.5, V. 47.7, V. 53.14, V. 69.3, VI. 50.7, VII. 35.1, VII, 69.5, X. 9.4, X 15.4, X. 37.11, X. 182.1-3) or as 'śam ca yośca' (as in Rg. I. 114.2, 189.2, II. 33.13, VIII, 39.4, VIII. 71.15). In these places the words are generally rendered as "happiness and welfare' or health and wealth' (by Keith in translation of Tai. S. II. 6.10.3) and these meanings generally suit the context, e. g. in Rg. VI. 50.7 'dhāta tokāya tanayāya sam yoh' (confer on our sons and progeny happiness and welfare), in Rg. X. 182 the words *athā karad-yajamānāya saṁ yoh'(may Bșhaspati confer happi ness and welfare on the sacrificer) occur as the last quarter of all the three verses. 'Sam' by itself occurs about 160 times in the Rgveda and it is somewliat romarkable that in Rg. VII, 35. 1-13 1132 the word sam occurs in each verse from 4 to 7 times (68 times in all). Rg. I. 114. 1 1133 ve bring these lauds to Rudra who is powerful, who has braided hair, who rules over valiant men, so that there may result welfare to our two-footed and four-footed beings and every thing in this village may be prosperous and free from distress' will bring out the import of

śam'. In some cases “san' and 'yoh' clearly appear to be employed like nouns in the objective case. For example, Rg. II. 33. 13 1134 "I hanker after the sam'and 'yoh' of Rudra (i. 6. under the power of Rudra), Ry. I. 111.2 "O Rudra! may we secure by your guidance that'samn'and 'yoḥ' that father Manu procured through sacrifice". Yāska (Nirukta IV, 21) while dealing with Rg. X. 15. 4 'athā naḥ sam yor-arapo dadhāta' holds 'samyoh' to be ablative or genitiro of samyu and explains as 'samanam ca rogāṇām sīvanam ca bhayānām (allaying of diseases and warding off of dangers). This is an etymological explanation and is in some cases accepted by Sayans and in others he paraphrases 'sam' by 'sukha'(happiness) and 'yoḥ'as 'duḥkha-viyoga' (freedoni from pain or distress). The word 'yoḥ' presents the appearance of the ablative or genitive singular of a noun from the root 'yu' which means 'to bind' or 

separate' or from 'yā' to go. "Yoh' by itself ocours only three times in the Rgveda (i. e, in I. 74. 7, X. 105. 3, X. 176. 3). The meaning of 'yoh' in these three cases is doubtful. In the Tai. Br. 1135 we have the mantra 'we choose that happiness and wel fare and success (or progress) to the sacrifico and the sacrificer; may divine fortune be ours; let there be good fortune for (our) men; may medicine (or remedy ) go up; may there be happiness to our men and quadrupeds'. 

In Atharvaveda 19. 9 the word śānti occurs about 17 times. In verses 3 to 5 speech ( vāk), the mind( manaḥ )1136 and the five senses are referred to and it is said that these geven usually produce what is ghora ( terrible or inauspicious ) and these same must exert themselves for producing śānti ( i. e. appeasement of angered deities or averting calamities or misfortunes). Verses 6-11 pray to several gods, planets (grabāḥ), the earth, falling stars, cows, the nakṣatras, magical rites, Rāhu, Dhūmaketu (comets ), the Rudras, Vasus and Adityas, sages and Bṛhaspati to confer happiness. Verse 12 prays to Indra, Brahmā, and all

the gods for refuge to the composer of the hymn and 13 declares that whatever things were appeased (by śāntis) in this world these the seven sages know. May they all be happiness for me; may happiness be mine and may freedom from fear be mine', Verse 14 which is similar to Vāj. S. 36.17 declares that the earth, mid-regions, heaven, waters, trees and plants, all gods-these have become appeased and auspicious by the śānti rites performed by the composer and that by those śāntis, by all śāntis I (we) appease ( remove the evil effect of) what is here terrible, what is cruel ( or inauspicious ), what is evil; may all that be appeased, be beneficial and happy for us ' 1137 Atharva 19. 10 (verses 1-10) contains the word 'sam' 51 times and prays for welfare to soveral gods and 19. 11 is also a śānti containing the word 'śam' 18 times. The Vājasaneya-samhitā chapter 36 ( verses 8-12) similarly contain the word 'sam' several times. One of these viz. ( Vāj. S. 36. 12 ) occurs in many Vedic texts 1138 "May the divine waters confer on us happiness, help and protection; may they flow towards us for our our happiness and welfare'. 

In the Tai. S. the words 'samayati' and 'śānti' are fre quently used oftea in the same passage or context. For example, it is said "Rudra 1139 is the fierce ( or harsh ) one among gods...; He ( the priest) does as it were a harsh thing when he recites (that passage containing the word) Rudra; 'in the path of Mitra' he says for the sake of appeasing". There is a similar passage in the Ait. Br. While prescribing the recital of a sk Verse (Rg. II, 33. 1) in the Āgnimāruta-sastra the Ait. Br. changes the original words of the latter half of the verse in the Rgveda and also suggests another verso altogether for recital

( I. 43. 6 'śani naḥ karatyarvate sugani mosāya mesye nrbhyo nāribhyo gave') because in the first place that verse begins with the auspicious word 'sam' and in the second place because that verse, though the derala ( deity) thereof is Rudra, does not expressly mention that word; the result, says the Ait. Br., is that that verse being one of appeasement (śānti) the priest secures long life and procures long life for the sacrificer, 

Another example of 'samayati in the Tai. S. is as follows : When an anihotrin is going on a journey with his houschold ho should offer homa to Vastospati, but if he goes without offering a homa to Vāstospati evil consequencos follow; 'Rudra is indeed Vāstospati; if he were to go out without offering homa to Vāstospati, Agni would become Rudra, would leap after him and kill him; (but) when he offers to Vastospati, he appeases him (Rudra-Agni) with his own share and the sacrificer meets no injury (or distress ):1140 

Another example of 'śāmayati' and 'santi' in the Tai. S. (VI. 3. 3. 2–3 ) may be set out. 'O tree! protect it; O axe! do not harm it; the axe indeed is a thunderbolt; (therefore he utters those words ) for allaying ( the fierce power of the axe); these worlds are afraid of the tree ( of which the yūpa is made ) when it moves; ( therefore he recites 'with thy top do not graze the sky, with thy middle do not harm the atmospheric region'. ( By these words ) he appeases ( removes the terrible power for evil of) this tree', 1141 

The foregoing passages are quite sufficient for showing the significance attached to the words 'śam', 'samayati' and 'śānti' in the Vedic samhitās. The word 'santama' occurs in the Rgveda about two dozen times. It is applied to the great gods like Agni, Indra, Soma (I. 16.7, I. 77.2, IX. 104,3), to the praises of gods (I. 76. 1, VI. 32. 1), to the worshipper or singer ( VIII. 13. 22 ), to protection by gods (1.76.3, X. 15. 4) and generally means 'beneficent or conferring happiness'.

The meaning of samayati 

23 

larly, the word 'santāti' (Rg. I. 112. 20, VIII, 18.7) means "beneficent'. 

The causal ( samayati) of the verb 'sam' and the word 

• śānti' do not occur in the Rgveda, but they are as said above frequently employed in the Taittiriya and other Sambitās and in the Brāhmaṇas. Some further examples may be set out here. The Tai, S. relates the following legend "Agni was in the yonder world (heaven), the sun was in this world; these worlds were (then) unappeased ( disturbed). The gods said 'come, let us change ( transpose) these two'. They placed Agni in this world with the words 'O Agni, come here for the dainty meal' and (placed) the Sun in the yonder world with the worlds 'the great and powerful one, O Agni'; then indeed these two worlds became free from disturbance. Since he repeated those words in this way, it served for the purpose of quieting these worlds that were once disturbed ). These worlds became undisturbed ( auspicious) for him who knows this ".1112 Here we have both the verbal form 'aśāmyatāma' (from 'sam' 4th conj.) and the the word 'śāntyai'. 

In some passages of the Roveda the word 'sami' occurs ( as in I. 87.5, II. 31. 6, III, 55.3, VIII. 45. 27, X. 40, 1.). It is generally interpreted by Sāyana in these passages as the locative singular of śami', which is explained to mean 'karman'(action, sacrifice or the like). Two of these may be cited here 1143 "my desires fly in many directions; I shall brighten ancient (lauds ) towards 'sami' (for employing them in various sacrifices ? ); knowing the truth in Turvaṣa (king) and Yadu (king) he (Indra) enveloped Ahnavāyya (their enemy) in warlike action.". It is possible to take 'sami' as the locative singular of 'sam' treated as a noun. The word 'sami' occurs in many passages of the Roveda (I. 20.2, I. 83. 4, I. 110. 4, II. 1. 9, III. 60. 3, IV. 3, 4, IV, 17. 18, IV. 22. 8, IV. 33. 4, V. 77, 4, V. 42. 10, VI. 3. 2, VI. 52. 1, VIII. 75. 14, 1X. 74. 7, X. 28. 12). In all these passages 

1142. इमौ लोकावशान्तावास्तां ते देवा अब्रुवनेतेमौ विप!हामेत्यग्न आ याहि वीतय इत्यस्मिलोकेऽग्निमवधुहदने सुवीर्यमित्यमुण्मिलोके आदित्यम्। ततो वा इमो लोकावशाम्यता vā HIGHIent: II cā 1 giais HI GHI Đinh 4 xi lan m. 7.

(Soo. III, Ch. XX 

Sāyaṇa interprets it as 'karma' and not as the 'sami tree or branch'. But in one place at least (if not in more places) the word sami can easily be held to mean 'the sami wood or fuel stick '. 11+ "To that mortal wlio worships with sacrifices and appeases with 'samis' (saml fuel-sticks) and gives offerings to Agni that abounds in wealth disappointment as to glory never comes nor does sin nor arrogance overtake him.' 

The whole of chapter 36 of the Vājasaneya-sarhitā is employed as sānti at the beginning and end of the Pravargya rite, according to Kāt. Sr. S. 26. 11 'śīntikaranain-ūdyantayoh'; verses 9-12 of Vāj. S. 36 employ the word 'sim' 17 times and verse 9 is the same as Rgveda I. 90. 9. 

An interesting text in connection with the root san' is the adhrigu praiṣu, to be recited by tho Hot! priest before the paśu is killed in a sacrifice. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 1121 note 2504 for the formula which is rather long. The important 115 words for the present purpose are at the beginning and at the end 'O divine slayers and human slayers I begin (the process of killing the pasu). ...O Adhrigu! you should slay (the pasu) in such a way that it would be properly carried out'. Here the root (sam ) certainly means to slay; this meaning is, however, apparently quite different from the one so far con sidered (viz, to appease, to remove evil effects). But it may be that there is a secondary meaning, viz. appease the gods by offering parts of the animal killed in the sacrifice. 

The Taittirlya-brāhmaṇa closely connects the sami tree or branch with the conjuring away or appeasing the terrible or angry aspects of deities in the following myth : 1146 "Prajapati

created Agni; he (Prajāpati) became afraid this Agni might burn me'. He (Prajāpati) pacified (the terrible flame or glow of) Agni with śami (branch); that is the beneficent or happy aspect i of śami in that the equipment required for Agni is full of sami in order to appease Agni and for freedom from being burnt thereafter.' The idea is that Agni, the moment it was created had a fierce and evil aspect, that was removed by the use of the sami and śānti means an action or rite that appeases the evil aspects of a deity and makes the deity beneficent. Similarly, the Aitareya-brāhmana says:1147 "Ho recites the verse they worship you with offerings whatever abodes you may have;...he says: 0 Soma! move towards houses in such a way as not to kill the sons (of the sacrificer).' Houses are indeed called 

duryā' and the house of the sacrificer is afraid of the king Soma when he approaches the sacrificer's house; when he (the priest) repeats this (verse ) he thereby appeases him (king Soma) by a śānti ( propitiatory rite); ue (Soma ) becoming beneficent ( by the respetition of the mantra ) does not kill the progeny or the cattle ( of the sacrificer)." The idea is that king Soma might be angry with the sacrificer if there be any defect in the sacri ficial rite and that when the hotṛ priest repeats the verse 'aviraha o-' that verse is the cause of appeasement. 

In the Satapatha-brāhmaṇa there is a similar reference to the appeasing power of the sami branch. “He (the priest ) places fuel sticks on this (Agni). ... He places (on Agui) a fuel stick of saml as the first. This ( Agni) was kindled when this oblation (of sami branch) was offered and flamed upwards. The gods became afraid of him ( Agni) lest Agni might harm them. They (gods) saw this sami branch and appeased him ( Agni) with that; inasmuch as they appeased this (Agni) by means of sami ( branch) this is called sami. In the same way this sacrificer appeases with sami this (Agni) for procuring appeasement and not for food"'1118. It would be noticed

that here the name sami' is derived from the root 'sam' and it is the means of effecting śānti ( appeasement ). 

In the Brāhmaṇas the means of appeasement are various but simple. Often times the recitation of a Vedic verse or hymn effects śānti. For example, the Taittiriya-brāhmaṇa 1119 prescribes the singing of sānans at the time of consecrating the sacred srauta fires; the three stīms are Rathantara, Vāmadevya and Bșhat, each being connected with tho three worlds respec tirely. “When Agni is being takon out, he sings the Vāmadevya sāman; Vāmadevya is the atmospheric region and thereby (i.e. by singing lamadevya) he makes Agni establishod in the atmospheric region; Vimadevya is śinti (means of bring ing about the appeasement of Agni); (on singing Vārnadevya ) he takes out Agni that has become appeasod ( beneficent) and as bestower of cattle". The Tai. S. says 1150" he says 'weave yo with regular measure the work of the singers'. Whatever super fluity (or flaw) is committed in the sacrilico, this (recitation ) serves to eradicate its evil effects". The Ait. Br. provides "(the priest) who is about to sprinkle holy water over him 1151 (the king) should (himself first recite the mantra and) make the king repeat it (after him)'O Wators! look on me with & beneficent eye, (and) touch my skin with (your) beneficent body. I invoke all the Agnis that dwell in waters for your sake; this should be done for the purpose that waters ( the evil aspects of which have been ) not appeased may not destroy the vigour of him who is being sprinkled over". The Hotr performs a jupa before and after reciting the sūmulleni verses. About this the Śānkhāyana-brābmana says1152 that the sāmidhenis are a thun

derbolt and that if japu is performed thereby he appeases (samajati) Agni (i. e. Agni becomes auspicious and beneficent). 

Water also is declared as a means of effecting the removal or appeasement of evil effects. The Ait. Br. remarks 1153 " they say what is the atonement (prayascitti) if a person's sacrificial material (milk or rice ) when put on a fire for cooking spurts out or overflows? (The reply is) 'he should make it go down with water for the sake of śānti; water indeed is (a means of ) śānti and then he should touch the material (that has fallen out) with his right hand and recite a mantra ( that is specified) or he should recite another rk verse by whose power the worlds are made fixed', which is addressed to Viṣnu and Varuṇa; Viṣnu indeed is the saviour against what is badly sacrificed (i. o. the defects in it), while Varuna protects (i. e. prevents obstacles to securing the fruit of ) what is well sacrificed; (this latter mantra is recited) for śānti in regard to both ( defects as well as good points). This is the prāyaścitti in this case." It should be noticed that here sānti (rite) and prāgascitti are identified. The Saṅkhāyana.1151 Br. also (III. 6) says “waters are (means of) śānti, (they are ) an antidote and therefore after pronouncing the word 'vaṣat' the priest touches water." In the Tai. Ār. (IV. 42 ) there are 37 mantras of śānti used in the Pravargya rite. Some of these occur in the Rgveda-samhita. e. g. the 8th ( Vata. a. vatu bhesajam) is Rg. X. 186. 1, mantras 15-17 are equal to Rg. IV. 31. 1-3; mantras 22-24 are Rg. X.9.1-3. The same Aranyaka ( IV. 26-35) and Baud. Sr. S. IX. 18 contain several mantras for śāntis, some of which are interesting and are set out here to show how the theory of śāntis was being expanded or enlarged. “If the 1:55 sacrificial vessel called

History of Dharnasāstra 

(Seo. III, Ch. XX 

mahālira (in Pravargya rite ) of the hot milk for the Gharma offering were to be stolen by a thief, one should offer in the Gārbapatya fire an oblation of ghee with the stura ladle to the accompaniment of the mantra “May Day and Night disclose thee as thief". "If a wild 1156 forest dog were to bark ( while the Pravargya rite is on), the priest should repeat by way of a magic forinula the text 'vi gā Indra vicaran spāśayasra' (O Indra, observe the cows while you more about'), should cast a kindled firebrand on both sides with the words 'O Agni, converse with Agni, and then he worships Agni with the words 'O Agni, salutation to thee once, twice, thrice &c.' If a vulture screeches he recites the formula 'you are undistinguishablo (from other birds ) since you have blood in your beak', if an owl or she-owl hoots he recites the mantra 'In this way the owl approaches &c.'. Therefore it may be said that sānti is used in the early Vedic texts in several senses viz. (1) the state of being freed from evil aspects or effects, (2) means of appoasing or removing evil aspects, such as water, a Vedic verse or hymn, (3) rite for appeasement. 

Apart from the simple śāntis for appeasing deities in sacri. ficial matters, even the Rgreda contains indications that there were other occurrences which were thought to be unlucky and against the supposed evil effects of which some remedies were employed. For example, Rg. X. 164 11-5) is a hymn declarod by the Anukramapi and Rgvidhāna IV, 20.1 as counteracting the indications of bad dreams.: 137 Verse 3 of it is 'May Agni place far away from us all evil and undesirable actions which we may have done while awake or asleep whether by our desires or imprecations or want of desire'.

In Rg.

VJII. 47. 14, 16-18, X. 36. 4, X. 37, 4 for bad dreams. Similarly, the Rgved contains verses which show that cries of birds were deemed to indicate coming good or evil and the hooting of the owl was thought to be unlucky. 'It 1159 (the bird ) frequently cries and proclaims what is to come and it propels bis speech as an oarsman propels a boat; O bird! May you be auspicious to us; may no overpowering (or unfavourable) phenomenon reach you from any side'. The three verses of Rg. II. 43 refer to the cries of birds. "The birds, chirping, utter cries towards the south of the house) like composers of songs that speak for food at various seasons; O bird! when you chirp, speak what would be to our welfare, when you are silent think of good thoughts about us; when flying up (from our house ) you utter (cries) like a lute; may we be endowed with valiant sons and speak much in assemblies'. Rg. X. 165 contains several verses about a kapota bird and one about an owl. Rg.

Ten dreams and sānti for them 

731 

The Aitaroy a-Aranyaka mentions ten dreams viz. a person 3008 a dark man with black teeth and such a man kills him, or a boar kills him, or an ape jumps on him, the wind carries him swiftly; having swallowed gold, he vomits it; he eats honey; he chews stalks of lotuses; he carries a single (red) lotus; he drives with a team of asses or boars; himself wearing a wreath of nalada flowers,1163 he drives towards the south a black cow having a black calf. If a man sees any one of these, he should fast, cook a dish of rice in milk in a vessel, offer into fire oblations thereof with each of the verses of the hymn to Night (Rg. X 127.1-8), feed brāhmaṇas with other food (cooked in the house) and should himself eat boiled rice'1161 The same Āraṇyaka mentions in the same context some unusual phenomena such as the sun appearing like the moon ( pale and without heat) or the sky becoming like madder and prescribes the recital of some Rgvedic verses ( such as IX. 67. 21–27, VIII, 6. 30, IX. 113. 6-11, I. 50. 10). 

The Chandogya Up. contains a verse saying 'if a person engaged in rites for securing a certain desired object sees a woman in a dream, one should understand on seeing such a sight that he will prosper (i. e. secure that object ).'11640 The Chāndogya Upanisad (VIII. 10.1), the Brhadaranyaka Upaniṣad (IV. 3. 7-20 ) and Praśna IV. 5 contain profound thoughts on the psychology of drean phenomena, but as that discussion

The south is the direction of the pitrs; vide Satapatha Br. 1. 2. 3. 17 (esā vai dik pitṛnad'). Therefore, to see in a dream oneself wearing a wreath of naladas or driving towards the south was deemed to forebode death,

The Atharvareda also has several rerses on dreams and on birds like lapola ( pigeon). The Kausikasūtra prescribes several verses of the Atharraveda as śāntis in the case of dreams: 'on seeing a dream a man washes his face with the verses (Atharva VI. 45.1 and 46. 1); if he sees a very terrible dream he offers into fire a cake of mixed grains 1165 or in another direction (in his enemy's field); he changes the side on which he sleeps with Atharra VII. 100. 1: on seeing himself eating in a dream he recites the mantra ( Atharra VII. 101. 1 ) and he looks on: with the verse vidma te' (Atharva VI. 46, 2) all ( dreams) vanish.' Two of these verses may be set out here: 'Odream! we know the place of thy birth : thou art the son of gods' sisters%3B thou art the helper of Yama: thou art the destroyer; thou art death; O dream : we know thee to be so; O dream ! do thou save us from evil dreams'; 'I turn round (and lie on my other side ) from evil dreaming, from bad dreaming, from ill-luck; I make brahman ( Vedic prayer) my defence; I put away the sorrows that come through dreamz :157 The Kityāyana-srauta-gūtra

The same śānti in Ap. for mahy adbhutas

The Apastamba-gļhya (8. 23.9) lumps together several unusual appearances and provides the same śānti in the case of all, 'If the post of a man's house puts forth shoots, or if honey is made in his house by bees or if the footprint of a pigeon is seen on the hearth or if disease arises in his family, or in the case of other miracles and prodigies, let him perform on the newmoon night, at dead of night, at a place where he does not hear the sound of water, the rites from the putting of wood on the fire to the Ajualhūmre olilations indicated in the next (Apas tambiyamantrapitha II.31. 14-23), and then perform Jaya and following oblations.' Very similar provisions are found in Jaiminiya-grhya 11. 7.1169 The Sāmavidhanabrāhmana contains several prāyaścittas ( really sîntis) on the happening of numerous incidents. A few examples are set out here ; when bad dreams1170 are soen, the person should make repetition of Rg.

should revolve in his mind the Devavrata verse, then (the enemies) would not kill him. If one's house were to be burnt 1171 ( accidentally) one should offer oblations anointed with ghee with the mantra 'born with the highest Dharman' (Sāmaveda no 90) and with words 'svābā to Agni'. In Il. 2.2 The Sāmavidhāna Br. prescribes a śānti for one seized or posessed by an evil spirit. A portion of Şadrimsabrāhmaṇa (viz. V. 1-10) is styled Adbhuta brāhmaṇa and contains sāntis for several kinds of utpātas. Some parts of it (such as V.2-3) correspond with Āśvalāyana-gļhya -pariśiṣta, 4. 11-15. The Sadvinnsa-brāhmana V.7. 2. provides for earthquakes and cracks in palaces, which are similar to Yoga yātrā 3. 13. The Atharrareda 19.9. 9 refers to showers of fall ing stars (naksatramulkābhihatam sam-astu naḥ) and Sad vimśa V. 9. 2. refers to falling ineteors and V. 10. 2. to images laughing, weeping &c. 

Reasons of space forbid further description of śāntis from the grhya-sūtras. 

The preceding discussion with regard to sāntis is enough to show that sāntis were prescribed in the Vedic literature, th:7 srautasūtras, Samaridhāna-brāhmana and Rgvidhāna, not only for appeasing the angry divinities or powers of evil, but also for occurrences like bad dreams or of portentous phenomena like the sun's or moon's appearance, the cries of unlucky birds &c. 

This subject about śāntis against all sorts of omens and portents was very much elaborated in the post-Vedic literature. An extensive literature on sintis exists in the Gṛbyasūtras, the Kausika-sūtra, the Atharvareda Parisistas (particularly Nos. V, XXXI on Kotiloma, XXXIII on Ghrtakambala, XXXVII on 'gamuccayaprāyascittam', resembling 13th chapter of Kausika, LVIII to LXVII on utpātas, adbhutaśāntis and dreams, LXXI and LXXII, the Purāṇas (like Matsya 92–93 and 228-238, Visnu. dharmottara I. 90–105, II. 124-127, II. 159-164.

(pp. 704 ff), the Sāntikamalakara of Kamalākarabhatta (ms. in Bhau Daji collection of the Bombay Asiatic Society), śānti mayūkha of Nilakantha. Of these the Adbhutasāgara is a very extensive work of 751 pages, edited by Pandit Murlidhar Jha and published by Prabhakari &c, Banares, in 1905 A. D. The Kștyakalpataru on Sāntis has not yet been edited and published in the Gaikwad Oriental Series. As compared with some other kūndas, the section on śānti is meagro. It deals only with the following; Kūrmavibhāga (the distribution of the countries in Bhārata in 9 groups); Graha-makha or Grahayāga quoting Yāj. I. 295–308, Matsya, Narasimha and Bhavisya and Davipurāna; Ayutahoma, Kotihoma; Pusyasnāna; Grabaśānti; Mātrśānti; Lingaśānti; Vināyakaśānti (quoting Yāj. I. 271-294 and Matsya ); Grahaṇasnāna; Saṅkrāntisnāna; mrtavatsābhiseka; ṣāntis for variouas utpātas; Gayatrihoma; Rudrajapavidhi; ābhicārikakarma (magic rites). It is neither possible nor necessary to deal with this vast mass on śānti in this work in detail. Many of the śāntis described therein and in older srauta and other works have been almost obsolete for a long time. Therefore, only a few śāntis now in vogue or very interesting from several viewpoints will be dealt with in this section. 1172 

The Kausikasūtra (chapter 13, kandikās 93–136) is con cerned with ailbliutas, their doscriptions and the śāntis therefor, Kandikā 93 brings together 42 portontous phenomena and the kandikās that follow deal with the description of the omen or portent and śāntis for each of these. In these śāntis, Atharva veda mantras play a secondary role and the majority of the

Gravenhage, 1951) on 'Saati' deals at some length only with śāntis in the Sambitās, Brāhmaṇas and Srautasūtras, According to keśava's Paddhati on Kausika-sūtra (I 8; Bloomfield's ed. p. 307) and Sāyaṇa in bis Iatro, to Atharvaveda there were five Kalpas of the Atharvaveda mentioned by (an ancient commentator) Upavarsa in his commentary on Jaimini 1.3. 11-14 called Kalpasūtrādbikarana viz. 977069, FETECH, MATCU, 3miṣthey and शान्तिकल्प. सायण says (Muradabad edition of samvat 1986) 'शान्तिकल्पेपि प्रथमं वैनायकग्रहगृहीतलक्षणानि तच्छान्तये सम्भाराहरणम्, अभिषेकवैनायकहोमाः, तत्पूजा ROUTE, 112cuur TEETTIERIAI (p 81, and p. 28 of Pandit's ed.), gr ORTATE XLIX ( turung p. 337, 4. 7).

mantras form an independent mantra material. It should be noted that at the end all these sāntis are spoken of as "prāyaścitta'. 

The subjects treated of in the Madanaratna (about 1425 to 1450 A. D.) on Santika-paustika would indicate how extensive was the cult of śāntis recommended in medieval times. The Anukramaṇikā at the beginning of the Ms. montions the follow ing: Vināyakasnāna; śāntis to placate the nine planets from the Sun to Ketu: Sanaiscarytata; śāntis to placate Saturn extracted from Skanda ( Nāgarakhandi and Prabhāsakhanda); worship of Jupiter and Venus; Sāntis based on the Yāmalas 117.4 on the conjunction of five or more planets; Grahasnānas froin Visaudharmottara; śāntis of the tithi and weekday when fever and other diseases seize a man; Nakśatraśānti; śāntis for the nine naksatras called Janma and the rest (vide note 772 for these nine nakṣatras); sintis for birth on Amārāsyā, or on Mūla, Āśleṣā or Jyesthā naksatra; santi for birth on the same naksatra as that of the father or (elder) brother; sāntis for birth on Ganda, Vaidhrti, Vyatipātayoga, Saṅkranti, Visanādi, ecplipses; sānti called Gomukhaprasava; sāntis declared for the protection of the foetus from the first and following months from conception: huli offerings; medicine for removing pains of the foetus; measures for easy delivery; for protection of the child after birth; bali on first day with mantras &c.; nīrājana &c., description of sprinkling the infant with holy water, satiating gods and pitrs with water, homas, yrıntras (mystical diagrams); 

1172a, The Yamalas are works of Tantra class, the numbers of which are variously given. But they are oftco said to be cight. Vide note 1598 below on tantras. The Rudrayāmala tantra was published by Jivananda containing over 6000 verses in 66 chapters in 1892. There are works called Ganesayāmala, Brabmayāmala, Kudra-yamala, Viṣnuyāmala, Sakti-yāmala, and several others. Certain glatis (or nādis) of certain tithis, weekdays and naksatras 3rc said by the Smṛti-kaustubha to be viṣanādis or viṣaghatis (producing very disastroos results ), but in astrological works certain ghaṭis of naksatras only have that appella tion and a person born on those gbatis forebodes the death and loss of the father, the mother, wealth and himself by poisoning, arms agd missiles (according to Dharmasindhu p. 184). The Jadanaratna on Santika (folios 15b to 20b) sets out oumerous details about all the 27 aaksatras from the work of Atreya, one (detail) being the visaghaṭi of each nakgatra e. g. as to Aøvini three nādikās after 50th gbaṭikā constitute visanādi, as to Bharani one gbaṭi after 24, as to Punarvasu and Pusya one ghaçi aftor 30 and 20 gbaṭis respectively and so on,

It would be impossible for reasons of space and also of use. fulness to set out the sāntis prescribed for the above adbhutas in Kausika, but a few may be described by way of illustration. When there is an earthquake 1177 one should offer (oblations of ghee) with five verses, three of which are addressed to Jiṣṇu (Vispu). Three of the verses are: “Just as the sun shines brightly in the heaven, Vāyu dwells in the sky and Agni enters the earth, so may this Jiṣnu be firm and unmoving. As the rivers day and night pour their sediment (clay or mud carried by them ) in the sea without fail, similarly may all tribes (of gods ? ) with one mind approach my invocation (or sacri. fice ) without fail; may the Goddess (Earth) along with all deities be firm and unmoving for me and may (the Goddess ) drive away from us all evil and pierce my enemies that hate me." After having offered oblations with the words 'svāhā to the earth' he swould offer oblations with the verses Atharva VI. 87. 1, VI. 88.1 and with the verses of the anurūka beginning with Atharva XII, 1. 1. This is the prāyascitti there (in case of an earthquake ). 

Where darkness seizes the sun, one should offer oblations with the verses 'arranging according to the season divino wonders, ( the sun ) rises up revolving ( driving away) the fierce ( aspects ) of the several seasons; may the sun passing over these on all sides come; may the Waters move along in all these worlds. May Indra and Agni, knowing well, protect thee with herbs ( remedies ); destroy all darkness according to the cosmic order and by true speech.' Having offered oblations with the words 'spāhā to the sun', he should again make oblations (in 

· Agai) with the hymn Atharva XVII, 1. He worships with the Rohita hymns ( Atharva XIII. 1-4). This is the prāyascitti in this case.

When the darkness ) floods the moon one should offer oblation into fire with the verse 1178 " Rahu creops over the shining king (the moon), the former (Rāhu) strikes him(the inoon) here (i. e, before us); a thousand of his (Rāhu's ) bodies aro to be destroyed; may (his) one hundred bodies porish !'. Having offered oblations with the words 'svāhā to, the Moon', ho should offer oblations with the hymn 'Sakadhūmam naksatrūṣi yad rājānam-akurvata' (Atharra VI. 138. 1). This is the prāyaścitta in this case, 1179 

In connection with sāntis three words require to be carefully 

· understood viz. a huta, itpūta and nimittı. Adbhuta is an ancient word. It occurs several times in the Rgveda and is generally applied to some gods in the sense of 'wonderful'. In some passages, however, it means 'future' and possibly also 

portentous'. For example, according to Nirukta I. 5 1180 the . sage Agastya first promised to offer an offering to Indra, but later he desired to offer the same to the Maruts, that then Indra came to Agastya and complained to him as in Rg. I. 170. 1 ( what was promised today, even that does not exist, nor will it (the hars) be there (for me) tomorrow; who knows (for certain)

This shows that here at least the meaning is 'a ब्राह्मण on whose joints dried cowdung cakes were placed.' Charpentier has an interesting paper on F H in Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies (London) for 1935 pp. 449-450 where he states tbat various scholars have given different meanings, viz, constellation, dung smoke, weather propbet (Bloomfield), Agoi (Caland), milky way and bimself that it means 'Kritikā.'.

Meaning of adbhuta, utpāta and nimitta 

what will happen in future! Yāska paraphrases 'adbhuta' by the word 'abhūta' (that has not taken place) and remarks that the word 'adbhuta' in popular speech also means 'something that has not happened before'. Rg. I. 25. 11 1181 says the intelligent man expects from this (Varuṇa) all wonders (or portentous happenings ), whether already performed or to be performed'. Rg. X. 105.7 is perhaps a little clearer than the preceding. '(May Indra reduce our sins) Indra who is golden bearded, who has tawny horses, whose jaw is never broken and who made against the dasynı for easily killing him a thunder bolt like the sky that is wonderful (or full of portents)'. The word usually employed in the Gșhyasūtras is adhluta and the śāntis are called 'adbhutaśāntis'. Adbhuta is a word of very general import. It includes not only such serious phenomena as earth-quakes, eclipses, comets, falling stars but such compara tively minor yet unexpected or unusual happenings as a cow yielding blood-red milk or a cow sucking the udder of another COW. The ancient writer Viddha-Garga defines "adbhuta' as any occurrence that had not occurred before or a total change coming over what has occurred before.1182 The 67th Ātharvana pariṭiṣta is called Adbhutaśānti (pp. 432-435). It distributes 'adbhutas' into seven groups relating to Indra, Varuna, Yama, Agni, Kubora, Viṣnu and Vāyu and names some adbhutas under each such as a rainbow at night (relating to Indra), a vulture or owl alighting on a man's house or a kapota entering it (relating to Yama), smoke without fire (relating to Agni), eclipse on the nakṣatra of a man's birth (relating to Viṣnu) and prescribes as śānti the japa of Atharvasiras, making brāhmaṇas say 'svasti,' honouring and feeding brāhmaṇas. That parisista is based on the Adbhutabrāhmana of the Simayeda. 

The word 'utpāta' is rare in the Srauta or Grūya sūtras. The Gautamadharma-sūtra, after enjoining upon the king to

But in the Purāṇas and the medieval Sanskrit works it is far more frequent than the word adbhuta; sometimes cuibhūta and !/pāla are used as synonyms. Garga says 11si ' deities become unfavourable owing to the wrong doings of nien and create extraordinary happen ings in the sky, atmospheric region and on the earth. These are the utpātas for all worlds created by gods; these utpātas sally forth for the destruction (of peuplu ) and they by their (terrific) appearances rouse people (to do what is proper.). Here the words 'adbhuta' and 'utpata' are used as synonyms. Similarly, Matsya (228. 1-2) appears to regard the two words as synonyms. 1185 Generally, however, the wird utpāta denotes 

ccurrences that portend evil to all. Amarakora treats 'ajanya', 'utpata' and 'upasarga' as synonyms. Utpata is defined by Garga, Varahamihira1166 and Atharra-parisista LXIV as the

Nimitta and utpūta

roverse of the usual natural order. Nimitta means, according", to Amarakosa (nimittam hetulaksmanoh) 'cause or prognostic. sign'. Nimitta may be auspicious or inauspicious. This is one distinction between utpāta (which generally denotes an unlucky. portent) and nimitta. There is another distinction. Nimitta is often restricted to the throbbing of a person's limbs (as in Matsya chap.241), though here and there it is used in a wider sense as in Gita. (I. 31) ( nimittani ca pasyami viparitani Kesava'OKesava! I see adverse omens), Ramayana, Ayodhyan. kanda. 4.17-19, Bhisma-parva2. 16-17, Virata 46. 30, Atharva parisista LXIV (Utpata-laksana) 10.9-10. 1187 It may be noted that Manu VI. 50 mentions 'utpāta' and 'nimitta' separately (p. 527 note 758). 

Examples of unfavourable happenings (nimittas or utpātas) occur plentifully in the Mahabharata, Sabhāparva 80.28-31, 81. 22-25, Vanaparva 179. 41, 224. 17-18, Virata .39. 4-6, 46. 24-32, Udyoga. 84.4-9, 156.28-30, Bhisma 2.17-33,3.65-74, 19. 36-38,99.21-28, 112.6-13, Drona 7. 34-41, 77.3-7, Salya 23.21-24, 56.8-14, 192. 17-21, Mausala. 1. 1-5, 2. 1-17 and the Ramayapa, Ayodhya 4. 17-19, Aranyakanda 23. 1-7 and 10-25, Yuddhakanda 10. 14-20, 23. 4-11, 35. 25-35, 41. 13-20, 53. 32, 65.47-51,95. 43,96. 40-41.

(nirghāta), motoors, she-jackals howling towards the south, fierce and dry wind with shower of sand; earth-quakes; sun solipsa at an unusual time (Rāmāyaṇa III. 23. 12, Sabha 80. 29, 81. 23 Salya 56. 10, Bhisma 3. 28); flashes of lightning without clouds; carnivorous birds like vultures and crows on temples; fort-walls and bastions; spontaneous fire; rent banners; halo of the sun and moon; river-flowing with bloody waters ; rain with out clouds, rain of blood or mud; trumpeting of elephants; sky filled with darkness; horses shedding tears; poals of thunder in a clear sky, rivers flowing in roverso direction; throbbing of the left arm and eye (in men); croaking of frogs; sea lashed into fury; images of gods trenibling, dancing, laughing or weeping (Bhiṣma 112, 11); pale sun, birds like pigoons and muinas and door weeping with face towards the sun; appearance of a headless trunk near the sun; strange births such as ass born of a cow, mouse born of an ichneumon (Yuddhakānula 35. 30). The auspicious signs described in the epics, are comparatively fow as in Balakāṇda 22.4, Udyoga $3, 23-26, 84. 117, Bhiṣma 3. 65–74, Śānti 52. 25, Āśvamedhika 53, 5-6. The principal auspicious signs are: clear sky Tithout clouds, wind blowing 1188 cool and pleasant to the skin, no dust raised, birds and animals proceeding to a man's right side, fire without being enveloped in smoke and with flames turned towards the right, shower of flowers, auspicious birds like ıxm, krans, peacock sending up chirpings to the right ( Karna 72. 12-13). 

The omens and portents mentioned in the two epics are generally described as occurring at certain important timon and events, e. g. on the eve of battles or when Dasaratha proposed that Rāma be crowned as yurarūjr, or when Pāpdavas startad on their exile into the forest or when Bbisma was anointed as commander-in-chief of the Kaurava hosts or when Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jayadratha before sunset. There is no grada tion or order in mentioning the omens and portents in these two works, but they are set out pell-mell. Untimely rain, thunder without clouds, croaking of frogs are on the same level and

uttered in the same breath with eclipses. But Garga, 1189 Parasara, Sabha-parva, Brhatsamhita 45. 2,Matsyapurapa 229.5, Atharva-parisista LXIX (1.2) and other works divide utpatas into three classes, viz. divya (arising from heavenly bodies), ūntariksa (springing in the sky or atmospheric region) and bhauma (that appear on the earth). This classification is ancient enough. The Atharvaveda. 1190_expressly refers to the three classes of utpātas ‘May the earthly and atmospheric utpātas and the planets moving in heaven confer welfare on us'. The Brhatsamhita. 1191 says that it is the king's business to arrange for śāntis in his kingdom for counteracting (the consequences of portents). Garga 1192 doclared that those who, when advised by brāhmaṇas for performing śāntis, perform auspicious rites with faith do not suffer defeat, but that those who having po faith or because of atheism or resentment do not perform rites for counteracting (omens) perish in a short time. Garga, the Brhatsamhita, Matsya 229. 6-9, Agni 263. 12-13 furnish examples of the three kinds of utpātas, 1193 viz. the divya ones are concerned with the abnormal conditions of planets and naksatras, eclipses, comets; those of atmospheric regions are hurricanes, unusual clouds, fall of meteors, twilights, preternatural reddish appearances of the quarters, halo, Fata Morgana (appearance of illusory town in the air), rainbow and strange rainfall (such as

of blood-red water, or fall of rain with fishes, tortoises &c.); those of the earth are earth-quake and unusual states of water reservoirs. The Brhatsambitā remarks that the evil conse quences of earthly (bhaumu) utpūtas when counteracted with śāntis are removed, the evil consequencos of utpātas from the atmospheric regions are reduced to a mild form ( by śāntis), while, according to somo (icāryas like Kāśyapa, says Utpala) divya utpātas are not counteracted by śāntis at all; the opinion of Varāhamihira himself appears to be that the consequences of even dilya utpātas are conjured away by the gifts of plenty of gold, food, cows and land and by spilling the milk of cows on the ground or in a Rudra temple and be performing kritihoma. Varāhamihira and Matsya further provide that daiva utpāta has evil effects (lit. bears fruit) in eight ways, viz. on the king himself, his son, his treasury, his converancos (horses, elephants &c,), his capital, his queen, purobita and his people.1191 

Numerous śāntis bearing different names are prescribed in Matsya, by Varāhamibira and others. The 18 santis prescribed in Matsya (228)114. and bearing the names of several gods will be briefly mentioned here. Abhaya-śānti is prescribed when a king desires to be a conqueror or when he is attacked by enemies or when he fears that witchcraft has been practised against him or when he desires to uproot his enemies or when a great danger threatens. The Saluun yn śānti is prescribed when a man is attacked by Tuberculosis or is weak owing to wounds or when a man desires to perform a sacrifice. When there is an earthquake or when there is a famine of food or there is excessive rain or drought or there is danger of locysts or when thieves are operating the Vuiṣnuri śānti is prescribed; Raudri sānti is employed against an epidemic among cattle or human beings or when ghosts appear or when a coronation is to take place or when there is fear of an invasion or there is treachery in one's kingdom, or when enemies are to be killed; Brūhmi śānti is performed when it is feared that Veda study would

perish or when atheism prevails or where honour is paid to persons unworthy of it; if strong winds blow for more than three days and disease spreads due to vāta, then Vāyavi sānti should be performed; Vūruṇi when there is fear of drought or there is abnormal rain (of blood &c.); Blūrgavi when there is danger of false accusation; Prūjāpalyū when abnormal births take place; Trūṣtri when there are abnormal conditions of implements; Kaumūri when śānti is to be performed for children; Agneyi when fire shows portentous appearances; Gāndharri when a person is disobeyed or his wife and servants perish, or he desires to perform śānti for horses; Āigirasi when elephants are affocted; Nairsli when danger arises from goblins; Yūniyū when there is fear of an accident leading to death or a bad dream; Kanberi when wealth is lost; I'arthivi when trees are affected by abnormal conditions ; Aincri when portents happen on Jyoșthā nakṣatra or on Anuradhā. 

The Agnipurāna (263. 7-8) refers to these 18 śāntis and says that the best śāntis are Amṛtā, Abhayā and Saumyā. Varahamihira mentions numerous śāntis on the happenings of several abnormal incidents. For reasons of space nothing can be said here about them. But one śānti deserves to be set out. 1195 *If a man perceives Yaksas, the astrologer should declare that an epidemic is very near; for counteracting them Garga per formed a propitiatory rite, viz. Mahāśāntis, offerings, plentiful food, worship of Indra and Indrāṇi.' The Bṛhatsambitā sets out ( 45. 82-95) certain happenings as not portentous when they happen in certain seasons and quotes several verses of Rṣiputra which also occur in Matsya 229. 14-25 with some variations; 

. g. in Caitra and Vaiśākha the following are auspicious (and not portents requiring śānti) lightning, meteors, earthquake, blazing twilight, noisy storms, halo, dust in sky, smoke in forests, rod sunrise and sunset.
