CHAPTER XXXII 

Yoga and Dharmaśāstra 

Saṅkhya and Yoga often go together in the Upaniṣads 28 well as in the Mahābhārata, the Bhagavadgitā and the Purāṇas and their relationship to one another is the same in all these. In Sv. Up. VI. 13, Vanaparva 2.15, śāntiparva 2270 228, 28, 289.1, 306. 65, 308, 25, 326. 100, 336. 69, Anuśāsana 14, 323, Bhagavad gitā V. 4-5, Padma purāpa (Pātālakbanda, 85. 11 ff), the two are mentioned together, 

Though Saṅkhya greatly influenced all works dealing with the evolution of the world in its various aspecte, it did not enjoy that great esteem among all sorts of people in India that the Yoga system enjoyed and still enjoys. The word yoga is derived from the root 'yuj' to join or to unite (of rudhādi class). The germs of yoga can be traced back to the Rgveda. Rgveda V. 81. 1 ( a verse in praise of Savitp ) reads 'wise men, priests and sacrificers concentrate their minds and join their prayers to the wise, the great (Savitr), who knows all (prayers). Another Vedic -271 verse also speaks of concentrating the mind. The word 'yoga' occurs frequently in the Rgveda in several shades of meaning. Sāyana in many passages takes yoga' to mean acquiring what is not already possessed' (as in Rg. I. 5. 3). In Rg, I. 18.7 God Sadasaspati (Agni) is said to pervade the prayers (or thoughts) of sacrificers. In Rg. I. 34. 9 it means 'yoking' (kada yogo vājino rāsabhagya yena yajñam Bāsatyo payāthaḥ'. The word 'yoga' is often used with the word kṣema (separately as in Rg. VII. 54. 3, VII. 86. 8) or as a compound

(as in Rg. X. 166. 5 Yogakṣemam va adayaham bbūyāsam uttamal'). There is a great distance or gap between the meaning of the word yoga in the Rgveda (even in the verses about concentrating the mind) and its meaning in some of the Upaniṣads and in classical Sanskrit. In Rg. X. 136. 2-3 thero is mention 3272 of munis, eons of Vātarajada, who wore dirty and tawny garments and who say in verse 3 'we being in oostasy (or wild bliss) owing to cur way of life as munis resort to winds; mortals! you look on our bodies only'. This shows that even in those ancient times, some people practised tapas, did not care what clothes they wore and thought they (i.e. their souls) would be merged in the wind (that is, the souls are formless and could not be seen). In Rg. VIII. 17. 14 Indra is said to be a friend of munis and muni is also a friend of every god in Rg. X. 136. 4. But as to yatis the position was rather different. The word yali occurs several times in the Rgveda but in most cases that word has no certain connection with the meaning of 'ascetio'. In Rg. VIII. 3. 9 'by which (says brabma priest ) wealth was given to Börgu from the yatis and by which you helped (or protected) Praskanva'; here Indra sooms to be opposed to yatis. In Rg. VIII, 6. 18 the poet says 'O valiant Indra! listen to my prayer alone from among the yatis and Bhṛgus that praised thee Here Sāyaṇa explains 'yatayaḥ' as Angirasah'. In any case 'yatis' are here shown to be devotees of Indra. But in other Sarbitas it is said that Indra threw 'yatis' to the wolves or hyenas, 1773 Later on, however, the meaning of yati seems to have changed. In those Samhitā passages 'yatis' appear to be persons hostile or alien to the Vedic rites, but what they did to deserve

Dr. Hauer la 'Der yoga als Hailweg (1932) remarks (on p. 13) that the word 'mapi' is

slaughter by Indra is not clear. In Atharvaveda II. 5. 3 Indra is said to have killed Vṭtra as he did in the case of yatis. Some of the Upaniṣads, however, show that 'yati' was a person who had given up worldly affairs, practised yoga and endeavoured after the knowledge of Atman and realized Brahma; vide Mundaka Up. III, 1, 5 (yama paśyanti yatayah kṣinadosāh) and III. 2. 6 (sannyāsayogād-yatayaḥ śuddhasattvaļ). Some like Haier in * Die Anfrange der Yoga-praxis', 1922 pp. 11 ff) hold that the Vrātyas of Atharvavada XV were eostation of the kṣatriya class and forerunners of Yogins. 

The word 'yoga'occurs in some of the Upaniṣads in the same sense in which it is employed in the Yogasūtra. In Katha Up. II. 1%, it is said 2274 the wise man reflecting on God by means of yoga, by concentrating the mind on the inner spirit becomes free from joy and grief' (adhyātmayogadhigamona ). The same Upaniṣad says that the state described in VI. 11 is regarded as Yoga because therein the organs (and the mind and buddhi) are firmly held under control. Ia Katha Up. VL 18 it is said that Naciketas having understood the vidyā and the whole procedure of Yoga propounded by Yama attained (the realization of) brahma. The word 'Yoga' occurs in the Tai. Up. II. 4 (in speaking about vijñanamaya atman, yoga is said to be its ātman, the exact sense being doubtful), and in the Sv. Up. II. 11 and VI. 13, Praśna (5.5-6) speaks of the three mātrās (a, u,m) of Om. In Sv. Up. 1. 3 Occurs the word 'dhyānayoga'. The Sv. Up. (II. 8–13) refers to āsana and prāpāyāma and sets out the first signs of the successful practics of Yoga. The Chan, Up. VIII, 15 appears to refer to pratyāhāra (though the technical word is not used ) in 'atmani sarvendri. yāṇi pratiṣthāpya'(having brought all organs of sense to rest in the atman).' The Bļ. Up. (1.5.23) appears to refer to prāṇāyama in he should observe the one vow, viz. inhalation and exhala tion (tasmad-ekameva vratam carot prāṇyao-oaiva apanyacca).

The idea appears to be that yoga had been fully developed at the time of the Katha Up, but that Upanimd did not set it out in detail. It may be further noted that the words gat ragt refer to Brahmavidya and that yoga-vidhi is separately raentioned (probably as a means to brahma. realization).

The Vedantagūtra (II. 1. 3 'etena yogaḥ pratyuktah) states that Yoga is refuted by the reasoning adopted for the refutation of the Sāṅkhya system. The position of Saskarāoārga as to both Sāokhya and Yoga has been stated above (pp. 1352 and 1361 n. 2208 and 2221). He points out in the pūrvapaksa that Voda 2375 proscribes Yoga as a means of achieving correct knowledge and refers to Bṛ, Up. II, 4. 5. He further points out that in the Sv. Up. Yoga is expounded in great detail after first mentioning the proper posture (for the practice of Yoga) in the words 'having held the body straigbt but raised high in three places viz. chest, neck and head' (Sv. Up. II, 8). From the words of Saṅkarācārya that in Yogaśāstra also Yoga is held to be a means of the realisation of right knowledge, it follows that be had a yogaśāstra before him in which occurred the words 'atha... yogah,' but as he does not einploy the word Yogasūtra he probably does not refer to a sūtra work. If a conjecture may be hazarded, it is possible that the Yogaśāstra meant by Saṅkara is a work like the Yogaśāstra ascribed to Yājñavalkya in Yāj. Smrti III. 110 (Yogaśāstram ca mat-proktam &c.). Saṅkaracārya admits on V. S. ]], 1, 3 that a part of the yoga is acceptable to him but other parts conflict with the Veda. Mundaka Up. (II 2.6) enjoins samūdhi in the words 'om-iti dhyāyatha ātmānam' as Saṅkarācārya states on V. S. II, 3. 39 (samadhyabhāvāc-ca). In the Upanisada 'Muni' and 'Yati' have come to denote 2276 the same meaning, o g. Bṛ. Up. IV. 4. 22 states one becomes muni by realizing this very self,'

while the Mundaka (III. 1. 5) 2777 states this self is to be attained by Truth, by tapas, by right knowledge and by sexual purity at all times: that self resides inside the body (like a light), is pure, whom spotless ascetics realize.' The Kathopaniṣad (III. 13), provides that the wise man should restrain speech in mind ( speech and mind, as the text stands), he should keep it within the self which is knowledge, he should keep down knowledge within the self that is, the great, and he, should keep that (the great) within the self which is quiet. The Upaniṣada thus not only employ the word 'Yoga' but provide some of the stages of yoga and its technique for realiz ing the Supreme Spirit. About twenty Yoga Upaniṣads are published at Adyar, edited by A. Mahadev Sastri (1920), but as their chronology is most uncertain and as most of them appear to the present writer to be later than the Mahābhārata, Manu and probably the Yogasūtra, they are passed over here and are referred to in this work sparingly.2278 

Pānini provides for the formation of the words yama and niyama (two angas) of Yoga and the word 'Yogin' appears to have been derived by him from the root 'yuj' with the affix 'ghinun'(i. e. in) in the sense of tūcchīlya (being babituated to) according to Pān. III. 2. 142 ( which is a very long gūtra ).2279

2278. That the yoga Upaniṣads are late productions may be briefly indicated here. Verses 10–14 of the trea (dealing with the adhāra and svadhisthāna cakras) are found in the race (verses, 43-47) and la the grap ( verses 4-9 ) with slight variations. Vide pp. 1060-1062 aod notes 1715-1717 above for the six chakras and the pādis. In the description of prāṇāyāma the sandilya Upanisad quotes certain verses with the words तदेते श्लोका भवन्ति, some of which occur in the गोरक्षशतक. One cannot say definitely that the sandilya borrows from G. S., but this is possible. All the ancient and medieval works on the several branches of yoga are not yet available, and therefore one cannot preclude the possibilsty that sāndilya and other yoga upanigads and three borrow from earlier sources not yet discovered.

History of Dharmasāstra i seo. VIII, Ch. XXXII 

The Āpastambadharmastitra (1. 8. 23. 3-6) quotes a verse "The total destruction of dosas (taints ) is due to Yoga in this life ; a wise man after having expelled all dosas that cause barm to all beings reaches peace (mokṣa)' and then it sota out fifteen dosas such as anger, ecstatic joy, greed, bypooriny, the destruc tion of which is due to Yoga and enumerates the qualities that are opposites of the dosas. This shows that long before the 4th or 5th century B. C. Yoga as a discipline of the mind had been well developed. 

The V.S. II. 1.3 indicates that the Sūtrakāra had before him a body of Yoga doctrines, some of which wore the same as those of the Saṅkhya and he also knew Samadhi (V. 9. II. 3, 39 ). Again, the V.8. mentions ( in IV.2.21) Yoging and distinguishes Saṅkhya and Yoga as smārta ( and not srauta). Saskarācārya on V. S. I. 3. 33 quotes the extant Yogasūtra II. 44 (syadhyāyad. iṣta-devata-samprayogah) and on 2280 V. S. II, 4, 12 he appears to be willing to admit that the Yoga-sîtra preceded V. S. and quotes Yogasūtra 1. 6 in the 2nd interpretation of that sūtra. 

The important question is whether the author of the V. S. refers to the extant Yogasutra. The present author holds for various reasons that the V. 8. does not refer to the prosent Yoga sūtra, but to the Yoga doctrines that had been developed even before the Katha Mundaka, Svetāśvatara and other Upaniṣads. 

In the Santiparva it is stated that the propounder 2281 of Saṅkhya W88 paramarsi (highest sage) Kapila, Hiranyagarbha

was the ancient knower of Yoga, no one else (know it); Apāntaratamas Was Vedācārya whom some called the sage Prāoinagarbbe. In the previous chapter it is stated that Saṅkhya, Yoga, Vedaranyaka and Panoarātra are one and are angas of each other. In Santi. 326. 65 Hiranyagarbha is again connected with Yogasastra. Videp. 1371above. In the Anusasanaparvan2 Sanatkumāra appears to be connected with Yoga as the founder, just as Kapila was the founder of Saṅkhya. In the Ahirbudhnya Samhita (XII. 32-33) it is stated that Hiranyagarbha first propounded two Yogagamhitās, one was called 'Nirodhayoga' and the other was called Karmayoga', the first of which was again divided twelve-fold. The Bhamati 2283 on V.S. II. 1.3 states that that sūtra does not totally negative the authoritativeness of the Yogaśāstra of Hiraṇyagarbha and Patañjali. The Viṣnu purāpa 2284 appears to quote two verses from Hiranyagarbha (vide note below). Vacaspati in his commentary on Yogasūtra I. 1 states that Yogi-Yājñavalkya mentions that Hiranyagarbha was the propounder of Yoga. Vāoaspati regards the Yogasūtra of Patanjali as later than Yoga-Yajñavalkya-smrti. There fore, it is almost certain that the v.S. refutes the doctrines of that Yoga system that was known to the Santiparva. 

In Salyaparva (chap. 50) a story is told about bhiksu Jaiglsavya who was a great Yogin and of 'Asita Devala', a householder staying on the holy Sārasvata-tirtba. ___In the Santiparva (or. od. chap. 222 = Ch. ed. chap. 229 ) there is a long dialogue between Jaigiṣavya and Asita about Yoga, one verse (14) 2285 from which may be cited 

2282, सनत्कुमारो योगानां सांख्यानां कपिलो पसि। अनुशासन 14.323 (addres. sed by उपमन्यु to महादेव).

here Yogins do not talk much by way of censure and praise of others and their minds are nevor affected by the praise and censure of them indulged in by others.' In that chap. Jaigi. ṣavya is described as one who was never angry nor joyful. In the Varābapurāpa ( 4. 14 ) it is stated that Kapila and Yogirat Jaiglṣarya came to king Aśvasiras that had taken the avabhrtha hath after Aśvamedha and assumed the forms of Visnu and Garuda respectively. It may be noted that on Y. S. II. 55 the hhāsya quotes several views, but prefers that of Jaigigavya. On Y. 8. III, 18, 2286 the bhāṣya mentions the dialogue between Avatya and Jaigisa vya, where the latter's opinion is stated to be that from the point of view of hairulyn, the happiness of contentment is also misery, though as compared to pleasures of sense contentment is supposed to be and may be called happiness 

In the Buddhacarita (XII) when Gautama (the future Buddha) approached a philosopher Arāda, the latter described to Gautama his idea of the path to moksa and mentioned Jaiglṣarya, Janaka and Vrddha. Parāśara as persons that had become liberated by following that path,2787 

From these references it follows that Jaigisavya was a great teacher of Yoga long before the Christian era and probably bad composed a work on Yoga not now available. 

There are numerous English translations of the Yogasutra (wholly or partly) and of the Bhāsya and Vacaspati's Com mentary, such as that by Dr. Rajendralal Mitra with text of Y, S., bhāsya and com. Kājamārtanda and an appendix (p. 218 227) noting 150 mgs. on Yoga (B. I. od. 1883 ); Swami Viveka nanda's "Rājayoga' (Vol. I. of collected works, ed. of 1946 ) pp. 200-304, which translates and explains all the sutras ; Dr. Ganganath Jha's translation (Bombay 1907); translation by 

Rama Prasad (pub. by Panini office, Allababad 1910); transla tion by Prof. J. H. Woods (in the Harvard Oriental Series, 1914) who read with the present author in Bombay for some months in 1909; Geraldine Coster in "Yoga and Western Psychology' (London, 1934) translates and explains many of

The number of works and papers on Yoga in general written by Indian and Western authors is very large. The present author has not read many of them. He may mention the following among those that he read or consulted; "Rājayoga' (complete works of Vivekananda, ed. of 1946, Mayavati, vOL I. pp. 119-313);

Sūtra with translation in German not in serial order but by subjects (such as yogāngas, kriyāyoga, Isvaraprapidhāna); Dr. Radhakrishnan's 'Indian Philosophy' vol.

Moore; gives translation of the whole yogasūtra with extracts from the bhāsya; Mercea Eliade's 'Yoga, immortality and freedom' translated from French into English by Willard R. Trask (London, 1958); ‘Hathayoga, 'an advanced method of physical education and concentration' by Prof. 8. 8. Goswami (L. N. Fowler, London, 1959); this is a very valuable book; it deals scientifically with yoga in all its aspects, but parti. cularly with āsanas of which 108 photographs are given; 'Con centration' by Mouni Sadhu (London, 1959); The Lotus and the Robot' by A. Koestler ( London, 1960). 

Many editions of the Yogasutra of Patañjali with the bhāsya of Vyāsa and the commentary (called Tattvavaisāradi) of Vācaspati have been printed in India. I shall mention only two or three editions of the text of the Sūtra and the two commentarios viz. the edition by the late Pandit Rajaram Shastri Bodas, printed in beautiful type at the Nirnayasagara Press in 1892 and the other, the Anandaśrama edition of 1932 which contains the sūtra, bhāsya, Vacaspati's commentary and also the commentary called Rājamārtanda of king Bhoja. In the Kashi Sanskrit series the Yogasūtra was printed (in 1930) with six commentaries viz. the Rājamārtaṇda of Bhojarāja, the Pradipikā of Bhāvā Ganesa, vitti by Nāgoji-bhatta, the Maṛi. prabbā by Rāmānandayati, the Candrika by Anantadeva and the Yoga-sudhākara by Sadāśivendra Sarasvati 2378 

The Yogagūtra, as compared with the sūtras of some other darśanas, is a brief one. It is divided into four pādus, vix. 

2288a. It should be noted that Bhojadeva omits Yogasūtra IV. 16 (me r a da AGHARTER aan Fan FENICE) which is commented upon in the Vyasabhāṣya and by Vācaspati. On the other hand, Yogasūtra III. 20 (na ca tat-sālambadam tasyāvlṣayībbūtatvāt) does not occur in the edition of Pandit Bodas Shastri and is not commented upon by Bhāvā Ganeta and Nāgoji. The form of the sūtra fo Y. S. IV. 16 makes one feel some doubt about its genuineacas, but as it is explained by the bhāṣya and Vāçaspati, one has to accept it as genuing,

Samadhi (concentration), Sadhana (means of attainment), Vibhūti (super-normal powers) and Kaivalya (aloofness, liberation). There are only 195 sūtras in all the pādas together (51+55+55+34). 

Dr. Radhakrishnan in 'Indian Philosophy' (vol II. of the ed. of 1931 pp. 341-42) holds that the author of the Yogasūtra is not later than 300 4. D. Prof. 8. N. Das Gupta in ‘History of Indian Philosophy' (vol. I. pp. 226–238) is in favour of the identity of the two Patañjalis and therefore holds that the author of the Yogasūtra flourished in the 2nd century B.O.2289 The Sanskrit paper of Pandit R. Ramamurtiśarmā in J. of Venkatesvara Institute of Tirupati (vol. II pp. 289-294) and Mr. Govind Das's brief note in I. A. vol. 44 (for 1915 p. 24) may also be read in this connection. Jacobi and (following him) Keith hold that the Yogasūtra (I. 40), meaning at the most the mastery of the Yogin extends from the minutost particle to the greatest magnitude imaginable', 2290 refers to the atomic theory of the world. This is a good sample of the way in which even great Western writers road in simple words later theories and try to give late dates to early works. The Upaniṣads speak of the self as more minute then what is anu and as greater than the great and the Mahābhārata also uses the same phraseology, There is no convincing reason to suppose that the Yogasutra refers only to a theory of atoms propounded in the Vaibeṣika system and is not paraphrasing the words of the Upaniṣad and the Mahābhārata. 

We have also to consider the early tradition embodied in an introductory verse in Bhojadeva's commentary (not later than 1055 A, D.) and mentioned by Cakrapāpi (commentator 

2289. Most scholars accept 2nd century B. C. as the date of the Mabābhāṣya, Dr. D. C. Sircar in I. H.Q. vol. 15 (pp. 633-638) tries to show that the Mahābhāṣya cannot be placed earlier than the 2nd century A, D. His argoments cannot be discussed here. The present author doas not agree with Dr. Sircar and holds that the arguments for placing the Mahābbāṣya in the 2nd century B. C. are far more weighty than those put forward by Dr. Sircar.

1396 History of Dharmalandra (Soc. VIII, Oh Xxx of the Carakasanhita 3291 (about 1060 A. D.) that Patakjall (doomed to be an avatūra of Saṣa ) composed works on Grammar, Yoga and Medicine. 

The present author cannot deal at length in this volume with the two questions of identity and of the dates of the two works, as be is mainly concerned with the influence of Yoga on Dharmaśāstra works. He thinks that hardly any cogent argi. monts have been advanced to positively disprove the identity of the authors of the Mahabhāsya and of the Yogasutra. Whether the revision of Caraka's work was done by the same Patañjali is very doubtful. In the Sāntiparva the founder of Cikitsita (medicine ) is said to have been Kṭspātreya and not Caraka nor Patañjali. The Caraka-sambitā uses the expression 'iti ha smāba bhagavān.Atreya)' in the beginning of its chapters. Caraka (in I. 1. 23 ff) states that the sage Bharad āja learnt Āyurveda from Indra His pupil was Punarvagu Atreya, who had six disciples viz. Agniveśa, Bheda, Jatākarpa, Parasara, Harita and Kṣarapāni. First, Agnivesa composed a treatine on Ayurveda and read it to Xtrega and then Bheda and others did so. In the chapter called Tisraisapiya' in Caraka-Bardhita (I. 11. 75) Krspātreya's view is specially mentioned. Therefore, it appears that Kroṇātreya 2292 is different from Atreya who is rovergntly mentioned at the beginning of Caraka's chapters, Even the Buddhacarita of Aśvaghoṣa mentions Ātreya as the first propounder of medical scienco. 

It is possible to argue that the tradition that Patañjali dealt with Yoga and Grammar is older than the Vakyapadiya of Bhartphari. That work states in its first section 22% (called Brahmakānda) that the taints that affect the body, speech and

intellect are purified (rospectively) by the sciences of medicine, grammar and metaphysics. Then in the eulogy of the Maha bhāṣya it remarks 'alabdhagadhe gāmbhīryād-uttana iva sausthavāt', on which the commentator explains that in the verse from the Brahmakāṇda the author of the Mahābhāṣya is praised and in the other verse there is praise of the bhāsya itself. From this it appears to follow that according to the commentator the Vākyapadiya attributes the three śāstras on medicine, grammar and metaphysics (i, e. Yoga) to Patañjali himself. 

Even if it be held that the authors of the Yogasūtra and of the Mahābhāṣya are different persons, there are hardly any reasons for definitely assigning the author of the Yogasūtra to a date later than the 2nd or 3rd century A. D. The date of the Yogabhāsya of Vyāsa is of considerable importance in arriving at the probable date of the Yogasūtra. But the question of the date of the Yogabhāṣya is also debatable. The Vyasa who composed the Yogabbāsya would have to be held as different from Vedavyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata. 

The author of the Yogasūtra is, according to the tradition embodied in such comparatively early commentaries as that of Vācaspatimisra, said to be Patanjali. Important questions arise as to his age and his identity with Patañjali, the author of the famous Mahabhāsya on Pāṇini'a grammar and the Vārtikas thereon. The grammarian Patañjali is generally held to have flourished about 150 B. O. Therefore, the question of identity becomes important for the date of the Yogasutra. Some scholars like Prof. B. Liebich, Dr. Hauer (p. 98 of the work of 1932 ) and Prof. Das Gupta favour the identity of the two, but several others such as Jacobi, Keith, Wooda, Renou are against it. Prof. Ronou (in I. E. Q. Vol. XVI. pp. 586-591) examines the question from the grammatical point of vior, points out that certain words like Pratyāhāra, Upasarga, Pratyaya are used in the Yogasūtra in senses entirely different from the senses of these words in the Mahabhāsya. But as the subjects of the two works are entirely different, the same words may have acquired different senses. Similarly, Prof. Renou relies on breaches of grammatical rules (in the Yogagūtra I. 34), while he says that Patañjali in the Mahabhāṣya is very strict in following Pāpini's rules though Parini himself is rarely not striot in observing his own rules as in "tat-prayojako hotusca! (I 4. 55) which is Against his own gūtra trjakābhyām kartari' (IL. 2. 15); but 

1398

Patanjali also employs such an expressions as 'aviravikanyāya 22 (which should be avyavikanyayena ) for which Patañjali ig oriticized in the long Pūryapaksa on Vyakarana contained in the Tantravārtika and which is not explained away in the reply to the Puryapakṣa. It cannot be supposed that the Yogasutra for the first time settled the technical terms of Yoga Yoga terms had been evolving from Upanisad times and Patanjali only used them in the sense which they had acquired in the course of centuries. Prof. Ronou arrives at the conclusion that the Yogasūtra is later by several conturies than the Mahabhāsys, Jacobi in his paper on the dates of the philosophical sūtras of the Brahmaṇas' (in JAOS, vol. 31 pp. 1-29 ) holds (p. 29 ) that be Yogasutra must be later that the 5th century A. D. and, following Garbe, thinks that it is not improbable that the Vyasabhasya was composed in the 7th century AD. The views of Jacobi are strongly criticized by Jwala Prasad in J. R. A. 8. for 1930 pp. 365–375. The present author disagrees with Jacobi and Prof. Ronou. 

The date of the Yogabbāṣya will have considerable bearing on the date of the Yogasūtra. The Yogabhāsya presupposes much literary activity on Yoga. It mentiona by name on Y. 8. II, 55 and on III. 18 Jaiglṣavya who is a prominent figure in the Mahābhārata as shown above ( pp. 1367 and 1374). Vide also the story of Asita Dovala with whom Jaiglṣavya atayed for many years as a bbiksu and adept in Yoga ( Salyaparva, chap. 50). It has to be remembered that several interpretations of the same Yogasutra are noted in the bhāṣya ( ag on II. 55). The Yogabhāṣya quotes several Kūrikūs and versos dealing with the matters treated of in the Y. 8. as on Y. S. I. 28, 48, II. 5, 28 (on nine causes that lead to Vivekakbyati ). II, 32, III, 6, JII, 15 (OD seven Cittadharmas of the apariltsta type ). Besides these, several quotations in proso are cited in the bhāṣya, many of which are attributed to Pancaśikha by Vācaspati (vide pp. 1373–74 above), and some ( as on II, 22, 30, 52) to āgamins (those who know the tradition or Voda). Therefore, it follows that some centuries intervene between the Yogasūtra and its bhāgya. 

The Bhagya on Y. 8. II. 42 quotes a verse with the words * tatha coktam' ( it has also been said ), which is identical with 

2294. In the ATBY OD 2 00 91, IV. 2. 88 and op YT. V. 1. 7 the words frontera occur. In the game in the moments against grammar (vyākaraga) it is urged patelliterate afat tari age ATEROS gapura: 84:- Unghiltefano (97. II. 4. 71) Aprivada o

a verge from the Santiparva. 2295 It is most unlikely that an author will rely on his own work for supporting a proposition propounded in another work of his own. Besides, the Yogabhāṣya quotes on Y. 8. I. 28 a verse, which is Vispupurāṇa229 VI. 6. 2. The Viṣnupurāṇa is one of the earliest among extant Purāṇas (vide above pp. 907-909 ) and cannot be assigned to a date later than the 3rd century A. D. Therefore, the Yogabhāṣya which quotes the Mahābhārata and the Viṣnupurāṇa may be assigned to about 4th century A. D. As argued above, the Y. S. would therefore have to be assigned to a date not later than the 2nd or 3rd century A, D. Though the present writer holds that the Yoga that is said to be refuted in V. S. IL 1.3 is not that of the Yoga Sūtra but the Yoga found in the Santiparva, yet he is not prepared to place the present Yogasūtra earlier than the 2nd century B. O. Mr. K, K, Kolhatkar in his very exhaustive and learned Introduction (in Marathi) asserts (on p. 126 ) that the Yogasūtra is later by 3000 years than the Brahmasūtra and that the Bhagavadgita was composed about 5000 years before the present day (p. 224). But he adduces no evidence for such an ancient date for that work. He probably relies on the traditions that Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata (including the Gitā ), flourished towards the end of the Dvāpara age and that Kaliyuga started in 3179 B. O. Modern critical scholarship doos not accept these traditional datings. 

Not only do some of the Upaniṣads contain references to Yoga technique and practices, but the Mahābhārata also dilates upon matters that pertain to the domain of Yoga. A few examples may be referred to here (the cr. ed. of the Mahābhārata in relied upon ). In the Santiparva, chap. 232 ( 241 of Ch, ed.)

it is stated 239 that kāma (desires), krodha (anger), lobha (covetousness ), bhaya (fear) and svapna (sleep) are the five dosas ( disturbances ), in the path of Yoga and then it proscribos means for mastering them. An important and striking assertion in that chapter is that even a person of the lowest rurṇa ( class ) or & woman who is intent on dharma may reach the highest goal by following this path 2298 (of Yoga ). The same chapter laya down (in verse 25 ) the proper places for the residence of a yogin and for the practice of Yoga, viz untenanted mountains and caves, temples, vacant houses, in order that ekāgratā (one pointedness of mind) may be achieved and that the yogin should treat in the same way a person who commends him or who speaks ill of him and should not contemplate the befalling of good or evil on any one. Chapter 289 of the Santiparva refers to Dhārapā ( verge 37 ) and states that a yogin that hag attained 2.99 spiritual power may transfer himself to thousands of other bodies and move about in those bodies on the earth and that this path ( of Yoga ) is regarded as difficult of access even to wise brāhmaṇas and no one can tread it with ease and that ona can stand easily on the sharp edges of razors, but to abide in Dhāraña of Yoga is difficult for those whose souls are not purified. Śāntiparva 304. 1 states that there is no knowledge equal to Saṅkhya and no spiritual power equal to Yoga; it further says that Yoga is eightfold ( vorge 7 ) and in verse 9 mentions

1401 

Dharana and Prāṇāyāma. The Asvamedhikaparva 19. 17 (Ch. ed.) appears to refer to pratyāhāra.2300 

There is also striking similarity between the Bhagavadgitā and the Yogasūtra. 2301 For example, the definition of Yoga in the Yogasūtra as the 'mastery over (or elimination of) the functions (or fluctuations) of the mind' has a close parallel in the Gitā. The Gitā insists on the yogin being 'aparigraba' (VI. 10); 'aparigpha' is one of the five yamas (Y. S. II, 30 ). Similarly, the seat and posture (āsana) in which a yogin is to practise must be stable ( this refers to the seat) and comfortable (says Yogasūtra ); the Gitā says the same thing in greater detail. In VIII, 12 the Gitā speaks of Yogadharapā. The Gitā says (in VI, 35 ) that the mind is certainly restless and difficult to control, but it can be controlled by practice and passionlessness and the Y. S. (I. 12 ) speaks of the same two means. The Gita (in V. 4-5) emphasizes that it is the ignorant that regard Saṅkhya and Yoga as different, that he who applies himself or stands com mitted to one of these secures the fruit held out by both and that he who bees both ways as identical soos truly. Hore Saṅkhya means (sannyāsa) renunciation' and Yoga means * Karma yoga', 

The Yogasūtra of Patañjali nowhere expressly sets out its scheme of the evolution of the world. But it contains enough material to enable us to hold that it presupposes and accepts some of the Saṅkhya doctrines such as the theory of Pradhana, the three guṇas and their characteristics, the real nature of the individual self and kaivalya (the state of the soul in final liberation). This may be established by a few references to Y.S. Y, S. III. 48 describes the results that ensue to the yogin from subjugation or mastery of the organs ( indriyas), one of which is

pradhanajaya 2302 ( subjugation of Pradhana. the primary cause of the world according to the Bankhya). The Y. 8. nowhere describes what Pradhana is and what its evolutes are. Therefore, it follows that it takes over from the Saṅkhya all that is geid about Pradhana. About the individual soul the Y. 8. states tha seer (Purusa) exiats zz03 as merely pure capacity of awareness (or as the mere power of seeing) and although pure (changeles or undefiled or free from any taints) appears as if he soos all tiporiences that really pertain to Buddhi).' The characteristics of the three guṇas (sattva, rajas and tamas) are clearly and succintly 1305 stated in Y. 8. as in 8. Kārikā 13, when it gaye *tbe seen (phenomenal universe) is characterized by light (sattva ), activity (rajas ) and inertia or dullness (tamas), it is the essence of the elements and organs and it exists for the purpose of giving experience and liberation (to the soul)'. The guṇas are frequently referred to in Y. 8. 1. 16, IV. 13, 32, 34 and satraguna in Y. S. II, 41, III. 33, 49 and 55. The Y. 8. postulates three pramūnas (in 1.7), but does not define them; the 8. Kāriki (4-6) mentions the same three pramāgas and briefly defines them. They both agree about the plurality of souls It may further be noted that Vyasabhāsya on Y. S. is full of Saṅkhya doctrines and quotes, according to Vācaspati, Pancasikha twelve times and Şasṭitantra once (vide above p. 1374 and . 2250 ). 

In spite of the fact that the Yogasūtra accepts some of the fundamental doctrines of the Bankhya, there are certain points of difference between the two. The standard Saṅkhya finds zo placa for God (Isvara ) i. e. it is frankly atheistic ( if theism means belief in God who is the creator of the universe and regulator of rewards and punishments), while Yoga finds a place for God in 

Y. 8. 1. 23-29, though not a basic one, but only secondary, probably as a concession to popular feelings and belief. The

The place of Itzura in Yogasūlra 

1403 

Y. 8, nowhere expressly says that Isvara is the creator of the world and all that it says about Him is that in him omniscience is at its highest, that He was the teacher of primal sages and that by repetition of the mystio syllable 'om' and reflection on it the yogin attains correct knowledge of the real nature of the self. In the next place, though the summum bonum in both systems is called kaivalya (8. Kārikā 64, 68 and Y. 8. III, 50, 55, IV, 34 ), yet the Sāṅkhya does not get out any elaborate discipline for attaining it except correct knowledge, that is, it is metaphysical and rational, while the Y, S. gives an elaborate treatment on mind discipline, insists on effort rather than inere jñāna, attaches great importance to prāṇāyāma and meditation (dhyāna) and is psychological. 

The Saṅkhya postulated that an intellectual understanding of the nature of purusa and of praksti (or gunas ) and of the difference between the two was sufficient for the emancipation of the individual self from the liability to rebirth, while yoga, on the other hand, was not content with this philosophic easy-going mental frame and emphasized systematic training of the will and emotions. In both Sāṅkhya and Yoga each individual soul is eternal and his destiny is to become free from the influence of Prakrti and its evolutes and to remain for ever the same ( vig. pure intelligence ). Herein they differ from the Advaita Vedānta, According to which the final destiny of the self is to become absorbed in and one with brahma. 

There is another matter for consideration. In the Yājña valkya-smrti, Yajnavalkya is put forward as saying that the Boul shining like a lamp in the heart should be realized, that on such realization the soul is not born again and as adding that for the purpose of attaining to Yoga one should understand the Aranyaka 2305 which 'I received from the Sun and also the

Yogaśāstra propounded by me.' In the Kūrmapurana it 18 Baid. that Yājñavalkya composed Yogaśāstra at the order of Hara'and the Vispupurāpa (IV. 4 107) states that Hirapyanabha attained the knowledge of Yoga from the great Yoglāvara Yajnavalkya who was a pupil of Jaimini. In the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Up. (II. 4) Yajñavalkya tells his wife Maitreyi (who hankered after immortality and cared daught for worldly goods) that he would expound to her the path to immortality and the very first sentence calls upon her to cultivate 'nididhyāga' (i. e, dhyana) and the first part of his discourse onds with the memorable words (ātmā vā are drastavyaḥ śrotavyo mantavyo nididhy. sitavyah, Bṛ, Up. II, 4.5). What work is meant by the Yoga Śāstra composed by Yāj. is a debatable point. There are three works (other than the Yāj. smrti) connected with the name of Yājñavalkya viz. ... Vļddha-Yājñavalkya, Yoga-Yajñavalkya and Bṭbad-yogi-yājñavalkya (vide H. of Dh, Vol I. p. 188-190). The last has beon published by Kaivalyadbama, Lonavla (1951), the Yoga-Yaj. was published in T. S. S. (1938) based on a single ms., then in the JBBRAS (vol. 28 and 29 ) by Shri P. C. Diwanji and now available in book form (1954). This last is in the form of a dialogue between the great yogin Yājöavalkya and Gārgi (who is identified with Maitreyi by Shri Diwanji on pp. 27-28 of his ed. of 1954 ) and sages and learned brāhmaṇas. Yājñavalkya narrates what he learnt from Brahmā. On Yāj. III. 110 the Dipakalikā of Sulapāṇi remarks that the Yogasāstra referred to is called. Yogiyājñavalkya'. But this again leads to uncertainty as both the works viz. that published by Kaivalya dhama and the one by Mr. Diwanji are 80 referred to as Yogi (or Yoga) Yajñavalkya in several digests. Mr. Diwanjia306 tries hard to establish that the work published by him 'has a better claim to be adjudged the specific work on Yoga referred to in Yaj. III. 113.' I think that the claim is not at all justified. The work edited by Mr. Diwanji no doubt contains a good deal of Yoga knowledge; while the work published by Kaivalyadhama also contains & good deal of Yoga material, though not as much as the work edited by Mr. Diwanji containg. It would be irrelevant to discuss here all the points made by Mr. Diwanji. The procent author is convinced that the work sponsored by Mr. Diwanji is not the work referred to by Yājóavalkya (in his smrti III. 110). It is a compilation of a later period. Some striking

matters alone may be pointed out to show that the Yoga 

Yājñavalkya oould not have been the work of the author of the Bpbadāraṇyaka and the Yogaśāstra (as stated in Yāj. III. 110 ) and of Yaj, smrti. In the Bṛ. Up. II. 4. 1 and IV.5.1 (Yājña valkyasya dve bhārye babhūvatur-Maitreyi ca Katyayani ca ) it is expressly stated that Yajāavalkya had two wives, (philosophy minded) Maitreyi and Kātýāyan! (worldly-minded). Maitreyi desired such knowledge as would lead to immortality and she asks questions, in all of which she addresses Yājsavalkya as * bhagavān' (in Bṛ. Up. II. 4. 3 and 13 and IV. 5. 4, 14) and never as mere Yājñavalkya. On the other hand, Gārgi in the Bṛ, Up, is called Vacaknavi (in III. 6. 1, 1II. 8.1 and 12 ), is not Yajnavalkya's wife but a pert and rationalistic woman inquirer like Afvala, Artabhāga, Bhujyu Lāhyāyani, Uṣasta Cākrāyaṇa, Kahola (all present in the court of Janaka), who including Gārgi questioned the claim of Yājöavalkya to be regarded as * brahmiṣtha'. In Bṛ. Up. III, 6.1 when Gārgi pursues her ratiocination too far (in matters depending upon āgama and being beyond reasoning ) Yājñavalkya reprimande her and says that she would die (lit: her head would fall away) if she pursued the subject in & pure logistic way. All those inquirers address Yājñavalkya as mere Yājñavalkya without any honorifio epithet like 'bhagavān' and Gārgi does the same (in Bṛ. Up. III. 6, 1, III. 8. 2-6). Aoc, to Yāj. Smrti III. 110 the Br. Up., a Yoga. śāstra and the smrti are the works of one man (whose two wives were Maitreyl and Katyayani) and who had a philosophical skirmish with Gārgl Vācaknavi ( according to the Br. Up.). The present Yogayājñavalkya (ed. by Mr. Diwanji) makes Gārgi wife of Yājñavalkya 2307 ( vadhūḥ). One would like to know whether Yaj. had three wives, as Bș. Up. says he had only two. Mr. Diwanji (pp. 27-28 of the ed, of 1954) tries to make light of this discrepanoy and regards Maitreyi as another name of Gārgi. We are here con cerned not with pure Yoga dootrines but with the question

ray Aura N. The two as may be noted; that would ordinarily show that it and it were different. It might be argued that having already learnt from Yāj. (io Bṛ. Up.) Maitreyi was present but took do part in the discussion and Gārgi alone asked questions. Verse 6 of chap. I could. be considered as using the words उत्तमा व tor मैत्रेयी and the words महाभांगी and are as applicable to troll, but this is made impossible by the text which lo I. 43 and IV. 5 refers to Girgi as the wife (bhāryā) of Yāj. and phe is addressed as 'priye' (IV. 7), 'vapārohe' pic.

whether a work attributed to Yaj. which makes Gārgi the wife of the ancient Yājāavalkya ( when the Upaniṣad makes her only a more or loss insolent woman) can be regarded as the work of the same Yāj. who propounded brahmavidyā in the Br. Up. and is supposed to have composed the Yāj. smrti. This ono circums bance alone is onough to brand the Yoga-Yajñavalkya ( of Mr. Diwanji) as a fabrication sought to be passed off as an ancient work. If identity was really meant the verso could easily bave been read as 'Maitreyyākhyā mahābhāgā' without any metrical fault. Therefore, it is not possible to hold that Yogayājñavalkya is the Yogaśāstra composed by Yājñavalkya before the Smrti going under his name was composed. A few other decisive grounds may also be urged. The work edited by Mr. Diwanji moptions Tantras ( in V. 10) and Tantrikas (in VIII. 4 and 25 ). The Yāj. smrti nowhere mentions these two and is free from the peculiar Tantrik words or technique. Therefore, the present Yogayājñavalkya edited by Mr. Diwanji was composed long after the Yāj. smrti and probably in the 8th century or after when Tantrik rites and works had become common. One more important matter may be adverted to. The Yāj. sınti and the Yoga-Yājñavalkya ( ed. by Mr. Diwanji ) both enumerate ten yamas and ten niyamas. But the two diverge materially in the ten names as the note below will show, 2008 The number of yamas and niyamas differs in different works, but if the Yāj. smrti and Yoga-Yājñavalkya were the works of the same author, the differences in the ten names would not have ocourred at all. Therefore, the author of the Yāj. empti is quite different from the author of the Y. Y. There is no evidence for holding that the latter flourished before the Sth or 9th century A. D. 

A good deal has been said by Mr. Diwanji in his paper on * Bṛbad-yogi-yājñavalkya and Yoga-Yajñavalkya' in ABORI, VOL. XXXIV (1953) pp. 1-29, in his preface to Yoga-Yājāavalky& in JBBRAS, volumes XXXVILI and XXXIX pp. 103-106 and by Swami Kuvalayanand in his reply in ABORI, vol. XXXVII for

It would not be relevant in this work to discuss the points in dispute between Mr. Diwanji and Swami Kuvalayanand. In the bhāsya on the Svetāśvataropaniṣad attributed to Saṅkarācārya 2309 (published by Anan, Press) on p. 28 four Ferses and a half are quoted from Yogi-Yajśavalkya, none of which is found either in Br. Y. Y. or Y. Y. Besides on Sv. Up. II. 9 (pp. 42-44) 29 verses on Yoga matters are quoted in the bhāṣya, but the name of the author or work whence the quotations are taken is not mentioned. Not one of the 29 verses wholly occurs in Mr. Diwanji's Y, Y. He is able to point out only five or six half verses as occurring in Y, Y. out of the 29 versos, while a whole yerse quoted in the bhāṣya (viz.'prāṇāyāmair' &c ) occurs in Bṛ. Y. Y. (8. 32 ). (It may be further pointed out that Aparārka and the Smrticandrika quote in all about 100 verses from Yogi (or Yoga-) Yājśavalky& which are found in Bs. Y. Y., but not in Y. Y. The Kṛtyakalpataru (on Mokṣakāṇda alone ) quotes (on pp. 146, 149, 166, 171, 196-197) about 70 verses from Yogi-yājāvalky& which are found in chapters 2, 8, 9 and 11 of the Br. Y. Y, Mr. Diwanji has not been able to show that verses of the Y. Y. (ed, by him ) are cited anywhere in the above three digests. Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacarya in his paper on Yogi-Yajāavalkya-gmṛti and its utilization in the medieval digests of Bengal and Mithila (in J.G. J. R. I, vol XV for 1958 pp. 135–140 ) points out that king Ballālasena of Bengal (1158–1179 A, D.) in his Dānasāgara contains a fairly large number of quotations from the Bșhad-Yogi Yaj. (pub. by Kaivalya-dhama). It appears that Viśvarūpa2210 (first half of 9th century A.D.) quotes a half verse from the Br. Y.Y. and remarks that the work is composed by the author of the Yāj. 

2309. The authenticity of the bbāsya as the great Saṅkarācārya's work is extremely doubtful. Io the whole of the extensive bhāsya on the Brahma sūtra Saṅkarācārya quotes ao Parāṇa by name but cites only a very few verses with the words 'iti parāṇe', But in the bhāsya on the Sv. Up, of . only 76 printed pages over 30 verses from Brahmapurana, about 30 verdes from Vispupurāṇa, about a dozen from the Lingapurāna and about half a dozen versos from the Sivadharmottara (on pp. 7, 34, 35) are cited.

smati himself Therefore, the Br. Y.Y. is an early work and cannot be assigned to a dato later than the 7th century A.D.; while Y.Y. is a much later oompilation composed in the 8th or 9th century or even later. The present author is not, however, prepared to hold that Br. Y. Y. is the Yogaśāstra of Yāj. mentioned in Yāj. sifti III, 110, since the Yoga material contained in it is meagre as compared with the Smrti material. The present author ia glad to find that on pp. 7-8 of the Sanskrit Preface to the edition of the Bșhad-Yogi-Yājñavalkya-smrti the editors express grave doubts about the identity of the author of the Yāj. smṛti with the author of the work edited by them. 

The Yogavāsiṣtha is an extensive work in 32000 ślokag (ope sloka meaning 32 syllables) printed in two volumes with & gomventary by Anandabodha by the Nirn. Press. It is really an eclectic work embodying 21 the tenets of the Gitā on anāsakti, the tenets of the Trika system of Kashmir, of Advaita Vedanta &c. Its text appears to have been added to from time to time. Controversies have raged about its date and its contribution to Indian philosophy. The present writer holds on reading the contributions 2312 that the extant Yogavāsiṣtha is a late work and was composed some time between the 11th and 13th century A. D. 

It is now necessary to furnish a brief outline of the main teachings of Y. S. Though the work is comparatively small, it! rendering in English requires to be amplified in order that it may be understandable. Only the most important and instruc tive matters are set out here. 

Yogi is defined (2nd sūtra) as the elimination of or mastery over the functions (activities) or fluctuations of the mind. This is provisionally explained by Vyasa ( on 1. 1.) as

1409 Samadhi. The different stages viz. bhūmis) of the mind ase five, being restless (ksipta), infatuated (mugdha or mudha), distracted (viksipta), one-pointed (ekagra) and controlled (niruddha.). 

In this connection (i.e. on the topic of bhumis) the present . author has to bring to the notice of readers a paper by Shri Kuvalayānanda contributed to the Yogamlmāmgā vol VI. No. 4 on Traditional reading of Pātañjala-yogagūtra III. 11; is it accurate.' The traditional reading accepted by the bhāṣya of Vyāsa and all other commentators is 'Sarvārthataikāgratayoh kṣayodayau cittasya samadhipariṇāmah'.\ The Svami2314 argues that the correct reading should be 'sarvarthatailarthayoh &c.' He states that the bhūmis should be six, the sixth being 'ekārtha' and bases his arguments on the combined explanations of Yoga sūtra I. 2-4, 18 and III. 9-12. All that the present writer can say is that his arguments deserve serious consideration. The fact that even Vyāsa, the bhāsyakāra of Yogasūtra, would have to be held not to have seen the difficulties in the traditional reading of Y. S. III. 11 would have to be given due weight before any final conclusion can be arrived at. That sūtra states the goal of Yoga viz. the soul that is seer abides in its own form then (i.e. when the functions of the mind have been mastered), while in ordinary life the soul appears to assume the forms of the fluctua tions of the mind.

The five vpliis , are pramūṇa (means of valid knowledge ), viparyaya (wrong Conception), rikalpa (fancy), nidrū (sleep), 2316 smrti (memory). Pramanas are three, pratyakṣa (perception), anumāna (inference), agama (verbal testimony). The means for the suppression of: the vșttis are abhyūsu (practice) and rurūgya (passionlessness ) (simultaneously carried on), the first being the effort to secure a calm flow of the mind free from vșttis, continued for a long time uninterruptedly and earnestly and the latter (vairāgya) being the consciousness of mastery over (i. e. freedom from thirst for) seen objects (such as woman, food and drink, high position) and objects promised by Revelation (such as heaven, disembodied existence &c.), 2317 Vairagya is of two kinds apara (described in Y. S. I. 15 just above) and para (highest) described in Y. S. I. 16 and bhāsya theroon. In the highest cairāgya the yogin (who has reached discrimination between the self and the quṇas, sattva &c.) is free from thirst not only for objects of sense, but also free from the guṇas, attains & stage of updisturbed consciousness only and leads the yogin to reflect .I have attained what was to be attained, the klesas (hindrancos 

2316. According to the Yogabbāsya on Y. S.

Just as in samadhi one bas to master other ideas (viz, misconception, fancy &c.), 50 tbc Yogi has to master sleep also as a bindrance to the attainment of Samadhi.

The Bhāṣya remarks the highest limit of consciousness (knowledge ) is Vairāgya and Kaivalya is inseparably connected with it.' Vāoaspati states that this last is called * Dharmamegha-samadhi' (mentioned in Y. S. IV. 29). Sūtras 17 and 18 of first pāda deal respectively with samprajñāta samadhi (conscious concentration) or sālambabasamādhi and asamprajñāta-samādbi (concentration in which there is no con sciousness of objects, gross or subtle). The first is of four kinds (or of four stages) viz. savitarka (deliberation over or realiza tion of a gross object like Sālagrāma or the image of a god with four arms and the like), savicāra ( where there is reflection over & subtle object such as the tan-mātrās), sānanda where the reflection is on the mind which is full of sattva (that is a samadhi of joy ) and sāsmitarūpa (i. e. where there is only a sense of personality in which the knower himself is the objeot of perception). 2318 These four kinds lead on to the asamprajñātam samādhi, which results when all vșttis have disappeared, when there is persistent exercise of this state and the mind consists of subliminal impressions only. Sūtras 19-51 (to the end of the first pāda) deal with the different kinds of samadhi, the different ways of attainment, the position of Iśvara in the Yoga system, the nine obstacles (antarāya) that cause distraction of the mind of the person who practices Yoga and the companions of these

The Patañjalasutra ( in I. 19-23 ) divides yogins for asamprajñāta-samadhi into various categories (nine in all), which are passed over here. Patanjali says that asamprajñata gamādhi in the case of yogins (who are not gods or not those whose bodies are resolved into primary matter) follows upon that practice which effects the cessation of all vșttis and wbiob com prises only subliminal consciousness and is preceded by faith, perfect repose or serenity, energy, mindfulness and discriming tory insight (into what is real) due to passionlessness. It would be noticed that so far Patañjali asks the aspirant for Yoga to rely on his own efforts, practice &c. He does not mention God or his grace anywhere so far. From this it follows that any man or woman and even one who is an agnostic may pursue yogio practices and attair to asamprajñāta-samadhi and liberation without devotion to God or without God's grace. But Patafjali as a keen psychologist know the help that faith affords. Therefore, he provides that, if you believe in God, He will help you in the praotice of Yoga and from that point of view he assigns to Isvara a role of a limited scope. 

In Y. S. I. 23-28 Patañjali provides that Samadhi and liberation (the result of Samadhi) may also be secured by 1319

devotion to Isvara (1śvara-prapidhāna) who is a special purusa, who is untouched by hindrances, by karma (good or evil) or by the results of aotions or by bankerings, in whom the omnisci ence, that is only & gorm ( in others ), is infinite; He, being not limited by time, is the teacher of even the ancient teachers. The mystic syllable (Om) is exprassive of (i. e. representative or symbol of) God and japa of that syllable and constant reflection upon the meaning of 'om'(i. e. on Isvara ) leads to one-pointed ness (ekāgrata) of mind. Devotion to Tývara secures for the practitioner attainment of right knowledge of the nature of the soul and the absence of hindrances (antarāya) that distract the mind (1. 29). These bindrances are nine such as illness, langour, doubt &c. and they are also called Yogamala ( taints or blemishes of Yoga), the enemies (prutipakṣa) of Yoga These hindrances aro aocompanied by pain, mental distress, tremor of the limbs, irregular inhalation and exhalation (I. 31). These distractions and their accompaniments that are the foos of samadhi may be prevented or mastered in various ways such as practice of con centration on one entity (Isvara or the like), by the practice of such attitudes of mind as friendliness, compassion, cheerful ness and indifference respectively towards the happy or the distressed, the good and the evil (133) or by the expulsion and retention of breath (bhāsya uses the word 'prāṇāyāma'). When the mind is concentrated then arise the four kinds of samprajñā. tanamādhi (called savitarka &c. in I. 17). The knowledge that is gained in the last kind of samprajñātasamādhi is of a higher order than what is obtained from scripture or inference and the subliminal impression made in this samadhi is hostile to all other impressions and when this last impression also is suppr. essed or removed, then results the seedless samādhi (i. e. asampr ajñātasamadhi). In this last the mind itself ceases (fron its task) and the yogin's soul iabides in itself, shines forth in its

Pada II. The first pāda ends on the note of samadhi and liberation i. e, describes the Yoga for him who has succeeded in concentration. The 2nd pāda deals with the procedure for & person whose miod is not used to concentration but is rostless, infatuated or distracted (vyutthita ) 2321 and who is desirous of learning the technique. This pāda is the most important of all the four padas for modern students, either Indian or Western, and has exerted great influence on Dharmaśāstra works. The fundamental idea of Yoga is that the individual self is real, eternal and pure, but it is immersed in the objective world and, though eternal, pursues transient objects. Patanjali is a master psychologist. The goal being set ( viz how to secure the isola tion of the soul from aridya and the gunos and its attainment of its own pure nature) Y. S. proscribes a rigorous discipline for the attainment of the goal. Patanjali differs from many modern Western psychologists (like Freud) 2322 in two very fundamental matters. The first is that Patañjali puts all emphasis at bis comipand on the freedom and liberation of the soul from bond. age, prescribes restraint of the activities of the mind as the

Freud gives the name "libido' to the energy of the sexual instinct, wbile Jung. who was once a disciple of Frend, diverged from Fread, bolds it as applicable to all forms of mental, psycho-physical or conative energy. The theory of the Oedipus complex is the cestral core of the Preudian system. It appcars that Freud later in life modified his theory of tbe Oedipus complex and, though be assumed that the Oedipus complex is present in every infant, he came to bold that in tbe course of aormal development the complex becomes eradicated in early child bood.

means and several preliminary steps of the training of ordinary emotions and will, while several modern psychologists condemn repression of the mind. In the 2nd place Patañjali is a firm believer in the doctrine of karma and rebirth and (in II. 12-15) holds that even good actions that give rise to a future life of pleasure and happiness are a misory to the enlightened, while modern paychologists speak of several innate instinots and are not at all agreed on what these are, they do not tackle the problem of karma and rebirth and their relation to what they call instincts. If there is no pre-existince of the soul as Christians and many others believe, how do the human instincts arise? There is hardly any convincing or satisfactory explanation of this. 

The first sūtra (of pāda II) says that the activities or practices that are preliminaries to the attainment of Yoga are tapas 2323 (austerity ), svādhyāya and devotion to īśvara; these,

The emphasis on asceticism (or tapas) appeared among Indians earlier than among any other known people. Io Rg. X. 190. 1 it is stated that right and truth and the suo and the moon and the universe are born of tapas. IO Rg X. 109, 4 the seves sages are said to have sat down for tapas. In Rg.

XI. 6. 4 it is indicated that tapas like Yajna would give everything. The Upaniṣads (e. g. Tai. Up. III. 5 'tapasā brabma vijijñāsasva', Br. Up. IV4, 22) emphasize that tapas is one of the means of realizing brahma, Chāa, Up. II. 23 postulates tapas as the 2nd of three dharınaskandhas. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 1 holds that the strict observances laid down for a Vedic student are called tapas (arvan 94797:); Gautama Dh. S. 19. 15 provides that sexual purity, truthfulness, bathing three times in the day, wearing a wet garment, sleeping on the sacrificial ground and fast are susterities.

Tapas is explained by Vyāsabbasya ( on Y. S. II, 32 ) as bearing or enduring the pairs (of opposites) such as hunger and thirst, cold and heat, standing and sitting, stillness of a stump (i, e. not indicating what is passing in one's mind even by gestures ), stillness of the body (not speaking at all), and also such observances as Kṛcchra, Cāndrāyana and Santapana (vide H. of Dh, vol.

The Vyasabhasya explains svādhyāya' as the japa : (inaudible repetition) of on and other holy texts or study of the sāstras treating of liberation, 2321 The Sat. Br.

Yāj. also (1. 198-202) emphasizes the great importance of tapas, Jaipiai (in PMS III. 8. 9) employs the word tapas for 'last'. Frequent ealogies of tapas are found in the Mahabharata as in Vanaparva 259. 13. 17, Sāoti, chap. 5 and 12 'Gods and sages secured their position by tapas', Āpuasana 122. 5–11).

target &c:), Prasna Up. V.5 (Yah punar-etam trimatrenomtty stenaivaksarepa param purusam-abhidhyayita). The Y. S. borrows this importance of Om froin the Upaniṣads. The five klesas are defined in Y. S. II. 5-9. Avidya (ignorance)2325 consists in regarding the non-aternal as eternal, the impure as pure, pain as pleasure, the non-self as the self. Asmita (senge of personality) consists in the seer (the self) being held as if identical with the instruments of seeing (such as mind and sense organs). Abhiniveśa (clinging to life) means the craving ('May I not cease to live, may I live') which sweeps on by its own force and is established in this form even among the learned. Tsvarapranidhana has been explained above (p. 1413 note 2319). The Y. S. (II. 11 and 12) says that the klesas have subtile con ditions (viz. avidyā and asmitā ) and coarse effects in the form of vrttis (the fluctuations of the mind, raga, dvesa and abhinivesa); escape from the former is secured by resolving them by means of real knowledge while the coarse ones are controlled by contemplation (dhyāna). The accumulated deposits of Karma arise from the five kleśas, are fit to be experienced in the seen birth (that is in the present birth) and in an unseen (i.e. future) birth. So long as the root (viz. the klesas) exists the accumulated karma leads to fruition in three forms viz. birth, life (long or short) and experience, which three result in giving joy or

anguish according as the accumulation is due to meritorious or . evil acts. The Yogasūtra says that the Yoga system has, just like the system of medicine, 2325a four divisions or aspects, vix. samsāra (the round of births or transmigration), the cause of sarnsāra, the release from samsāra, the means of release (Vic. samyak-darsana, insight into reality or discriminating discern ment between the puruṣa and sattva, unassailed by falso know ledge ); sūtras 16-27 of the 2nd pāda set out these four and explain sone of the terms used in defining them. Sūtra 28 provides that when impurities are washed away by practising the angaṣ of Yoga, the knowledge shines forth (more and more till discriminatory discernment becomes perfect. Then sūtra2376 29 enumerates the eight angas (aids, or auxiliaries) of Yoga, viz. yama (abstinences), niyama (observances), āsana (bodily posture ), prānāyāma (control or regulation of breath ), pratyābāra (withdrawal or suppression of the organs of sense ), dhāraṇā (fixed attention ), dhyana ( meditation or contemplation ), samadhi (concentration or absorption into the objeot of medita tion).

The fives mentioned in यो.. IL.3 are called विपर्यय. It is somewhat surprising that the eight aigas 'यम...समाधयोटापानि (ia prose) are quoted as from AETICA in the eye (ATTE . 167) and by 9451 p. 1022. The area (B. I. ed.) VIII. 10 divides yogins into three classes owing to the differences in their practices and abstentions, viz.सारक एकार्य and विसरग, and each of these is again subdivided into farther sob-classes. It further states that some of these called Abirodhakāā do not practise prāṇāyāma, others called Mārgagāḥ practise only prāṇāyāma and the rest and those called vimārgagāḥ practise all the eight angas, but they regard even God that is proper for contemplation as not so. The origioal words are partiet Yafaa ... 4rgegaan vaqt4Fq4gafa. It is difficult to say what the last clause exactly means. It is probable that in this sentence reference is made to some class of yogias that do not contem plate on God, but hold that without contemplation on God they cao secure liberation (kaivalya, mukti).Yamas and niyamas defined and explained 1419 angas of Yoga. The remaining sūtrag of pāda two (from 30 to 55) deal with the enumeration and definitions of yamas and niyamas, their explanations and the treatment of asana, prāṇāyāma and pratyābāra. The Santiparva (304.7 = 316.7 of Ch. ed.) speaks of Yoga as 'aṣtagupita' or aṣtagupin). Out of the eight asgas the first five are indirectly useful for samadhi, because they eradicate what are opposed to samādhi (such as hithea, agatya &c.), and are therefore called bahiranga ( external, indirect) sādhanas (means) of Yoga, while dhāraṇā, dhyana and samādhi are said to be antaranga to Yoga (Y. S. II. 7, 'trayam-antarangam pūryebhyah'. The last three are dealt with in the 3rd pāda. It is these sūtras in the 2nd pāda that are emphasized and elaborated in Dharmaśāstra works. Therefore some detailed treatment of these matters is needed here. 

In some works, such as the Gorakṣasemhitā the angas of yoga are said to be only six (omitting yama and niyama or omitting some others). The Maitrāyani Up. (VI, 18), the Dhyānabindu Up. the Atri-smrti XL 6, Daksa VII. 34, Skandapurāṇa, Kāśikhaṇda, 41. 59 and Buddhists say the same. Manu 2327 provides (IV. 204) '& wise man should always practise yamas but not the niyamas always; one who only practises niyamas and does not practise yamas incurs sin (or falls into hell)'. This does not mean that niyamas are forbidden but it means only this that yamas are far more im portant than niyamas. The words 'yama' and 'niyama' both occur in the Santiparva (or. ed. 326. 15 and 339.16 of Oh, ed.). Some Smrtis omit them from the angas of yoga probably because they are proscribed for all persons in general by Manu, Yāj. and others. Manu does not enumerate yamas and niyaman, but Yāj. (quoted on p. 1406, n. 2303 above) enumerates ten yamas and ten niyamas. The five yamas 228 of the Y. S. are

alimsū (non injury to all creatures and at all times), satya ( truthfulness ), asteyu (non-stealing i. e, not appropriating others' things in a way not sanctionod by the Siatra ), brahma arya (i. e. control of the organ of generation while guarding the other organs of sense also), aparigrala (non-acceptance of anything from another beyond what is necessary for preserving the body). These five constitute for a yogin a great viata when practised without reference to species, place, time and occasions (or exigencios). As provided by Manu, yainas have to be observed by all but there are exceptions. The observanco of yamas would be called vrata, but the rigorous observance of yamas without allowing exceptions is called by the Y. 8. mahāvrata which has to be observed by yogins without oxception at all stages. The observance of yamas and niya mas is a first step for the soul's ultimate success in winning Liberation or Isolation (kaivalya), since, unless the soul is purged of all sexual and egoistic desires, it cannot live the divine or spiritual life that the higher stages of yoga require. What is meant may be briefly exem plified as follows: Smptis recognize some exceptions to all these in the case of ordinary people. For example, it is the kṣatriya's duty to fight and therefore it was provided by Manu (VII, 87,89) that a ksatriya should not run away from battle and that kṣatriyas fighting and dying in battle on both sides went to heaven. Vide Yaj. I. 324. So him was allowed to a ksatriya but if he wanted to follow the Yoga discipline he had to give up himsā. Similarly, Smrtis excused untruth on five occasions (vide Gautama 23. 29, Vasistha 16. 36, Adiparra 82. 16, Santi parva 34, 25 and 165, 30, quoted in H. of Dh, vol. III. p. 353 and notes 536, 537 ). Mapu in IV. 138 makes an exception for ordinary men viz. one should not speak what though true is painful to another (na brūyat satyamapriyam). But one who enters on the discipline of Yoga must always speak the truth except when speaking the truth would result in the ruin of

creatures,2329 The Mitāksarā on Yāj. III. 312 remarks that telling a falsehood in the case of arranging a marriage though excused (by smśtis) should be avoided and also the beating of a son or a pupil as punishment by one who observes a vrata. A householder who approaches his wife on certain specified days after her monthly illness and avoids the paryan days (vide H. of Dh. vol. III n 1425) is to be regarded as one observing brahmacarya, acc. to Yaj. I. 79 and Manu IV. 128, but if he takes to the path of Yoga, he would have to give up this latitude (vide note 2308, 2330 above) and avoid all contact whatever with all women including his own wife as the Lingapurāṇa empha sizes. The Yuktidipikā, one of the earliest commentaries on the Saṅkhyakārikā, mentions (on p. 112) five yamas but puts 'akalkata' (absence of crookedness) as the 5th instead of aparigraha, The Vishupurana (VI. 7. 36-37) enumerates five yamas and five niyamas as in Y, S. but substitutes 'mind bent on the highest brahma' (kurvita brahmani tathā parasmin pravanani wanah) for Tāvarapranidhāna'. The five niyamas according to Y. S. II.32 2331 are sauca (cleanliness), santosa (contentment), tapas (austerity), svādhyāya (study of Veda), iśvarapranidhāna (devotion to God, or SUITondering all actions to him). Three of the five niyamas, viz. tapas, svādhyaya and Isvarapranidhāna constitute kriyāyoga as already stated in Y.S. II.1. It is most difficult to give an objective definition of duty, but duties can be defined on the subjective side. The object of emphasizing duties is to make mon rise above lower desires and to make the higher self shine forth. These are

based more or less on the Upaniṣads; vide e. &. Chān. Up. III. 17. 4 where tapas, ahiinsīī, truthfulness, dāna, (charity) and ārjain (straightforwardness) are put forward as virtues to be cultivated by a sacrificer, Br. Up. V. 2.3. where all mon are asked to cultivate dama (self-restraint), dūna (charity), dayū (kindness). Therefore, the yamas prescribed by the Yogasītra constitute what may be called extra-regarding duties and are mostly in the nature of prohibitions (such as 'don't injure anyone, don't tell a lie, don't rob a person, don't accept gifts'), while the nigamas are concerned with the individual himself (who has embarked On Yoga practice ) and are of a positive character (viz. be clean, be contented, be austere, do study the Veda and be a devotee of Isvara ). The Amarakośa 2332 defines 'yama' as actions that are obligatory (or to be always performed) and that depend upon the body as the means for being carried out, while niyamas are acts that are not obligatory (or not to be continuously engaged in) and that depend ( for carrying thema out) on means that are outside the body (such as water &o). Sauca (cleanliness) is of two kinds, būhya ( of the body effected with water, loose earth, pancagavya, pure food &c.) and ablıyantara (internal or mental). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 651 52 and vol. IV. pp. 310-311 for details of the sauca of both kinds. A verse of Manu (V. 106) deserves to be noted 2:33 in this COD Nection viz. 'of all kinds of sauoa the highest is the one that relates to wealth (one must desire wealth without depriving another of his wealth by improper means); that man is suci (pure) who is pure as to wealth and not he who is purified by loose earth and water.' Sūtras 33-34 of pāda II provide that when the practitioner of Yoga is assailed by the outbreak of the fever of perverse thoughts (such as 'I shall kill him who has harmed me', 'I shall tell a lie, I shall appropriate another's wealth, I shall commit adultery with another's wife'), he should revolve in his mind and cultivate the opposites of such thoughts and dwell on the consequences of such thoughts, viz. they cause endless suffering and lack of right knowledge.

Yama and niyama ethical code for yogin 

1423 

niyama constitute the preliminary ethical code which an aspirant for yoga must observa and some part of it must be followed by all men as Mam and Yaj. prescribe. 

In sūtras 35 to 45 (of pāda IL) the results of the continuous practice of the several yamas and niyamas are set out viz. when the aspirant has become established in abimsā, all beings (mon and animals) give up enmity 2334 in his presence. When the aspirant for Yoga is well grounded in the practice of abstinence from falsehood his speech comes out to be effective unfailingly (that is, if he says to a person'be you a righteous man' or 'may you attain heaven', the man becomes righteous or attains svarga). When he becomes rooted in abstinence from theft all jawels wait upon him from all quarters (that is, though he may not hanker after riches or mean8, the latter come to him of their own accord). When the Yogin is firmly fixed in brahmacarya, 2335 he securos energy (whereby he treads the path to such super normal powers as animā) and when he reaches perfection he is able to transfer knowledge about Yoga and its angas to his disciples. In Y, S. L 20 it is stated that asamprajñāta-samadhi follows when the yogin has faith, virya (energy) and other qualities. The groatest emphasis is laid on chastity in thought, word and deed for the yogin or the seeker for brahma (vide Mundaka III, 1.5, 'satyena labhyas-tapasā hyeṣa ātmā samyag jñānena brahmacaryena nityam'). The idea is that the yogin makes very rapid progress towards the final goal of samadhi and kaivalya if he is thoroughly chaste and that without it the practice of rajayoga is futile and dangerous. Those interested in the importance of 'brahmacarya' should read Mahātmā Gandhi's 'self-restraint versus self-indulgence' (3rd ed. 1928), particularly the Appendix I. pp. 137-158 which reproduce W. L. Hare's artiole). When the yogin is firmly established in non

acceptance of gifts he has a desire to know his past, present and future lives (and receives illumination thereon). 

As a result of having to clean 2336 one's body the Yogin becomes disgusted with his own body and avoids oontact with the bodies of others. Other results of cleanliness (of the mind) that arise are the purity of salt vaguni ( i. e. not being assailed by rajas and tanus), gentleness, one-pointedness (of the mind), mastery over the senses and fitness for the sight (realization) of the Self, From contentment results 2337 supreme happiness. Tapas gives rise 2338 to perfection in the body (i. e. acquisition of some occult powers like animā) and perfection as to the sense organs ( such as being able to hear and to see what is distant) owing to the eradication of impurities (i. e.the klesas and ain); (continuous) study of the Veda (and japa of om &c.) leads on to the union with ( realization of the deity he chooses. From devotion to Iśvara results perfection in Samadhi. 

Asana (bodily posture ; 2339 is defined in Y. S. as one that is stable and easy (or comfortable). Āsana means a seat which is covered with kusa grass, deer-skin and a garment in that order ( this would be būhya ūsana) as laid down in Gita (VI. 11),

The word अनन्त is explained in different ways. पाच. explains अनन्ते वा नागनायके स्थिरतरफणासहनविकृतविश्वम्भरामण्डले समा पलं चित्तमासनं निर्वतयतीति'. This is rather lar-tetched and unsatisfactory, as bardly anywhere else is अनन्तनागसमापत्ति recommended, भोज takes अनन्त to mean आकाश 'यवा चाकाशादिगत आनन्त्ये चेतसः समापत्तिः क्रियतेऽग्यवधानेन तावाल्प. मापद्यते तदा देहाहंकाराभावानासनं दुःखजनकं भवति। This is a little better tbaa Vacaspati's explanation. Brahma is described as सत्यं ज्ञानमन बस (ते. उप... 1). 

Asanas in yogasastra

while the word asap, (in Yoga) means bodily posture. It should be noticed that the Yogasūtra does not expressly prescribe any of the numerous asadas mentioned and defined in the Hatha yogapradipika and other works on Hathayoga and indicates that those asanas are not necessary in the practice of the Pātañjala Yoga and that any posture which is easy, stable and comfortable would be enough for the yogin, The Y, S, here follows the Sv. Up. (LI, 8 and 10 ) and not the works on Hatha yoga, if any existed in its times. In order to secure the posture described above the yogin should relax the usual physical movements of the body (prayatnaśaithilya) and bring the mind to reflect on the Infinite (brahma). As a result of perfect mastery over posture, he is not overwhelmed (or overcome) by the pairs of opposites (such as heat and cold, hunger and thirst). 

A few words must be said about āsanas. The present author recommends to all those interested in asanas a very useful and instructive handbook (in 188 pages) on asanas' composed and published by Sri Kuvalayānanda of the Kaivalyadhāma at Lonavla near Poona (third impression in 1949 ) with 81 platos (78 on different asanas and 3 on nauli). The Dakṣasmrti (VII, 5) mentions Padmāsana and Yāj. in III. 198 appears to allude to it. Dr. K. T. Behanan on 'Yoga, & scientifio evaluation' ingerts 16 figures (between pp. 186-187) of several asanas, Though the Y. 8, does not mention any asana by name yet the Vyāsabhāṣya 2340 names ton and indicates by the word 'adi'

(IV.1. 7-10) has in view, acc. to Saṅkarācārya, the description of asana in the Gitī (VI. 11), the relaxation of bodily activities and stableness of posture indicated by such words as 'dhyāyatīva prthivi'(Chān. Up. VII. 6.1). According to the H. P. (I. 17 ) āsana is the first anga of Hathayoga, that Siva speaks of 84 asanas, of which four āsanas called Siddha, Padma, Simba and Bhadra are the most essential ( sārabhūta) and it recommends Siddhāsapa as the best (I. 31 ) and describes it (1. 35). The Hathayogapradipikā namos and describes 15 āsanas in I. 19-55. The Dhyānabindu Upaniṣad states that there are innumerable āsanas but mentions the same four as the most prominent. Vide figures 16 (p. 55), 18 (p. 57), 62 (p. 97) in Sri. Kuvalayānanda's work for Siddha, Padma and Simha āsanas respectively and figures 105 (p. 186), 106 (p. 187), and 108 (p. 188), for the asanas called Siddha, Padma and Baddha padma respectively in Prof. S. S. Goswami's work on Hathayoga and p. 28-30 for Siddhāsana, Padmasana and Baddha-padmām Bana respectively in Alain Danielou's work (London, 1949). The Sivasambitā (III. 100) and Gherandasainhita (II. 1) men tion that there are 84 āsanas, while the Goraksasataka 2342 states that there are as many asanas as there are living species, that all of them are known to Siva, that out of 84 lakhs of asanas Siva choge 84 and that out of these Siddhāsana and Padmāsana are the best and defines these two (I. 5-9).

Supreme Self may be promoted) in the Bhagavadgita, which itself is described as Yogaśāstra and each chapter of which is also called Yoga. For example, we have in the Gitā "abhyāsayoga' (8.8, 12. 9), karmayoga (3.3. and 7), jñānayoga (3.3.), bhakti yoga (14,26). A few other works also do the same. Some Western writers speak of several kinds of Yoga such as Mantrayoga, Jñanayoga, Bhaktiyoga, Karmayoga, Rājayoga and Hathayoga (vide' Bengal Lancer' by F. Yeats-Brown, London, 1930, p. 284), R. C. Oman's 'The Mystics, ascetics and saints of India' p. 172 (ed. of 1905), Geraldine Coster's * Yoga and Western psychology' p. 10, Alain Danielou's work pp. 83 ff. (for descriptions of Mantrayoga, Layayoga, Kundaliniyoga &c.). Some late Sang krit works like the Yogatattyopanisad 2343 and Sivasamhita (5.9) speak of four Yogas viz. Mantrayoga, Hathayoga, Laya yoga and Rājayoga. All these have in view the system of Patañjali, but each emphasizes some particular aspect of yoga discipline. But there are really only two main systems of Yoga, viz. the one expounded in the Yogasūtra and its bbāṣya by Vyāsa and the other dealt with in such works as the Gorakṣaśataka, the Hathayogapradīpikā of Svātmārāma-yogin2344 with the commentary called Jyotsna by Brahmānanda Briefly, the difference between the two is that the Yoga of Patañjali con centrates all effort on the discipline of the mind, while Hatha yoga mainly concerns itself with the body, its health, its purity and freedom from diseases. This is illustrated by the facts that Patañjali defines āsana as any posture that is 'sthirasukba', while works on Hathayoga describe many asanas like Mayūr āsana, Kukkuṭāsana, Siddhāsana, which are deemed to remove

Hathayoga, if practised with proper guidance and perseverance, will not only endow a man with a strong, healthy, pure and active body but also may develop inner strength and happiness. The technique of Hathayoga claims three kinds of results viz. (1) cure of diseases and disorders of the mind also; (2) attainment of supernatural powers called siddhis; (3) leading to Rajayoga and Kairulya.

is expounded only for leading on to.Rājayoga 2346 i.e. Rajayoga is the principal fruit of Hathayoga and not siddhis and Kaivalya is due to Rājayoga. The Hathayogapradipikā enumerates the names of the same eight āngas as Patañjali dogs, but its yamas are ten of which taking a light meal is the principal and ahimsā 

is the first among niyamas. Besides the eight angas, it deals specially with Mahamudrā, Khecari, Jalandhara, Uddiyana and Mūlabandha, Vajroli, Amaroli and Sabajoli (I. 26-27). The Hathayogapradīpikā (1. 5-8) mentions that Hathayoga started from Ādinātha (i, e. Śiva) and then enumerates 35 great siddhas in all from Matsyendranātha, Gorakṣanātha onwards. The famous exposition of the Bhagavadgitā by Jñānadeva called Jñanesvari cites at the end the Guruparampara as Ādinātha, Matsyendranātha, Gorakṣanātha, Gabininātha, Nivșttinātba, 

Jõānadeva 

There are other differences between the works on Hathayoga and the Patañjala Yoga. According to the Gorakṣagataka and H. Y. P. the main aim of āsana and prānāyāma is to rouge the Kundalini (the vital force in a person slumbering at the base of the spine coiled like a snake) and take it through the several cakras and the Suṣumnānādi to brahmadrāra, while the Y. S. hardly ever dilates upon chakras and nādis, 2317 Several people after reading some modern works on Kuṇdalini are tempted to make efforts to rouge the Kundalini. This is a dangerous experi ment. Shri Purohit Swami in his 'Aphorisms of Yoga' states

2347, Y. S. mentions Nābhicakra, which means no more than the gavel that is circular in shape, and Kūrmanādi in III. 29 and III. 31 respec tively. Vide Goraksagatata verses 10-23, 54-67 for the chakras, gādis, brahmadvāra &c. and H. Y. P. III for the awakening of Kundalini. Tha Goraksasataka is set out (transliterated text and translation) in W, G. Briggs' work 'Gorakhnath add the Kanphatas' pp. 284-304 and was recently edited and pablished by Swami Kuvalayanand with translation and potes (1959). Dr. Hazariprasad Dwivedi has written a work called 'Nath Sampra. daya' (1950) and Dr. Mohansingh also has a work on "Gorakboath and medieval Hindu mysticism'. If we take the Garnparampark set out in the Jõānesvari, Gorakboath should be taken to have floarishod about 1100 A, D. or a little later. Vide 'the life of Goraksanath and the succession of disciples' (in Marathi) by Mr. R. C, Dhere (1959). pp. 224.

that the awakening of the Kundalini is a terrifying experience, that on the first day on which the Kundalini was awakened, the whole body was as it wore on fire and he thought that he was dying and that he drank in three months gallons of milk and clarified butter and ate all the leaves on two nimba troes (pp. 57-58 of the translation). The germ of the dootrine of Dadia in Tantras is found in a verse occurring in Katha Up. VI. 16 and Chān, Up. VIII. 6. 6 'there are hundred and one nadis (arteries) of the heart; one of them penetrates the (crown of) head; moring upwards by it, one attains immortality; the others (of the nāc Is ) serve for departing in various directions.' The Praśna Up. (IU, 6–7) states that each of 101 nādis has 72 sub-nādia, each of which again has 1000 more. Vide Mundaka Up. II. 2.6. In Chān. Up. VIII. 6. 1 it is stated that the nādis of the heart consist of a subtle gubstance, brown, white, blue, yellow or red in colour. This is probably the germ of the statement of a nādi being called pingalā. The Maitrā. yapi Up. VI. 21 speaks of the nādi going upwards as Suṣumnā. 

The Viṣnupurāna mentions Bhadrāsana 2318 which passage is quoted by Vācaspati. The Purāṇas, Vāyu (11.13), Mārkandeye (36.28), Kūrma (II, 11. 43), Libga (I. 8. 86), Garuda (1 238.11) mention the same three āsanas, viz. Svastika, Padma and Ardhāgana, The Viṣpudharmottara-purāṇa (III. 283. 6) pros cribes for dhyāna the asanas called Svastika, Sarvatobhadra, Kamala (Padma) and Paryanka. The Bhagavata III. 28. 8 employs the same words as the Gita VI, 11 about ūsana (viz. 

śucau dośe pratisthāpya). 

Āgadas are of two kinds, one type being helpful for prāṇā. yāma, meditation and concentration, such as Padma, Siddha and Svastika (figure 20 p. 59 in Su Kuvalayananda'a handbook on 'Asanas'). The other kind of asanas are helpful in eradicat ing diseases and for physical culture. But most of them require different physical movements and the final form assumed by these postures would make deep meditation difficult, if not impossible (vide Sirṣāsana figures 24-27 between pp. 62-63 of SM Kuvalayānanda's handbook on Asanas), Barvangasada (figures 33-36) of the same work, Hālāsana (fig. 42-47 of the same), Viparitakarani (figures 77-78 pp, 121-123), Mayurasana

(figure 72 p. 109). The Tejobindu Upaniṣad I. 23 (Adyar ed )2349 holds that alone is (proper) asana which makes continuous meditation on brahma possible; other postures only lead to dis comfort.' It should not be supposed that one who seeks higher yogio disciplines must devote some time to -āsanas and then pass on to the next stage. The asanas are primarily meant for physical culture and eradication of diseases. If the individual yogin possesses a tolerably sound body he may proceed with prāṇāyāma and other angas. Besides the postures, the practi tioner of Yoga is asked to gaze steadily at the tip of his nose (Gita VI. 13).

Some regulations are prescribed about the food to be taken or avoided by a seeker after Yoga and about the places where he is to practise. The Śāntiparva 2350 of the Mahābhārata provides that the yogin should subsist on cooked small particles of grains, or oilcakes and should avoid oily substances and even when subsisting on yāvaka (i, e. kulmāṣa or cooked barley grains) for long, he would still be strong; he should drink water and milk mixed together and should resort to oaves. The Mārkandeya. purāṇa (q. by Krtyakalpataru on Mokṣa pp. 167–177) states 'The yogin should begin meditation in unoccupied spots, in forests, caves and should avoid practising Yoga in noisy places, near fire and water, in old cowsheds, where four roads meet, near a heap of dried leaves, on a river bank, in a cemetery or in a place where creeping oreatures exist, in a dangerous place, near a well, near a caitya (funeral ground) or an anthill'. The same purāṇa says that he should not practise when bis stomach is windy, or he is hungry or tired or when disturbed in mind, nor when it is very cold or hot or windy. The Devala Dharmasūtra 2351

presoribes that a yogin should practise meditation in a shrine, empty house, mountain cave, on the sands of a river, in gave, or in a forest, in & pure spot free from danger. H. Y. P. I. 61 and 64 prescribe what foods to avoid and what foods may be eaten. The Goraksaśataka 2352 prescribes that the yogin should give up pungent, suur and salted food and should subsist on milk diet. The Gita (VI. 16-17) says 'one cannot succeed in Yoga who eats too much nor one who observes total fast and Yoga renoves pain for himn who takes proper food and exercise. The Chan. Up. (VII. 26. 2) where Sanatkumāra gives instruo tion to Nārada about the Reality remarks Purity of the mind follows on purity of food &o. (ābāraśuddbau sativa 

śuddhiḥ' &c.). Apararka on Yaj. I. 154 quotes a long prose passage (ou p. 271) from Harita "one should be pure and should subsist on a linnited quantity of food that would be enough or useful for his purpose as the acāryas say 'purity of mind ...food". It is clear that Hārita takes the words "ābārasuddhau &c.' literally, while Saṅkarācārya in his bhāsya on Chān, takes āhāra to mean' experience of objects of sense such as Sabda'. 

Prāṇāyāma-It is this anga of Yoga that figures most in the works on Dharmaśāstra from the earliest times. Literally the word means 'restraint or pause of prāna'. Other synonymous words are 'prāṇasainyama' (note 2310) and 'pripagarrodha'. The important point is: What does 'Prāpa' mean bere, The word is derived from the root 'an'(to breathe) with the prefix 'pra'. The verb and its forms occur in the Rgveda as in I. 101.5, X. 121. 3, X. 125.4. In various passages of the Rg. prāṇa means simply 'breath' (as in I. 66. 1, III. 53.21, X. 69. 6. In Rg. X. 90, 13 (prāṇād-vāyur-ajāyata) it is stated that Vāyu (air, wind) arose from the prāṇa of the primaval purusa. The word asu' also is used in the Rgveda in the sense of prāna' in I. 113. 16 ( udhirdhyam jivo asur-na agāt), I. 164. 4. We have both prūnanu (breath ) and jivana (life) in Rg. I. 48. 10 (addressed to Usas). Perhaps apāna is suggested in Rg. X 189, 2 (antaścarati rocanāsya prādād-apāṇati). Al the five

Vedic reference to five prānas 

1435 

names of prāṇas appear in pairs as in the note 2353 below from Tāi. 8. In the Tai. 8. I, 7.9.2 occur the three words 'prāṇa, apāna and vyāna'. The Atharvayeda (in VIII, 1. 1) mentions * prāṇāḥ' and 'apānāḥ' in the plural and asu', 'prāṇa' and *ayuḥ' in VIII. 1.3, all probably meaning 'life'. In the Upaniṣads, prāna becomes the vital force or principle of all beings, the representative or symbol of brahma; vide Bș. Up. I. 6.3 (Prāṇo vā amrtam, nāmarūpe satyam, tābhyām-ayam prāṇaśchannah), Bṛ. Up. L5. 23, which, after quoting a verse that the sun rises from Prāṇa and sets in Prāṇa, goes on to say (tasmādekam-eva vratam carot, prāṇyāc-caiva-apānyacca, non-mā fāpmā pityur-āpnavad-iti) 'therefore one must observe only one vow, he should inhale and exhale with the (fearful) thought that otherwise, the Evil one, Death, might seize me'. Here it appears that we have the germ of the theory of the importance of prāṇāyāma. In Chan, Up. V. 18-24 it is stated that the five āhutis are offered to prāṇa, vyāna, apāna, samāna and udāna (in the words 'Prānāya syābā' &c.) at the time of a meal and that one who knows the true meaning of Agnihotra and offerings offers it in all worlds, in all beings and in all selves. Even now these āhutis are takan before meals by brāhmaṇas, only the order of the five differs. Praśna II, 13 says:– All this that is established in the three worlds is under the dominance of Prāṇa.' In Chān. Up. IV. 3. 3 Prāna is again given five bames on account of its working in the different parts of the human body viz. prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, samāna and udāna (all five being named in the Tai. S.). It follows that some distinction among. the operation of the five prāṇas must have been made at least a thousand years before the Christian era.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sea VIII, Oh, XXXII 

In this work it is not necessary to enter upon an exbaustive discussion on prāna from the Upaniṣads. A controversy has gone on about the meaning of prāna and apāng. Caland, Keith, Dumont and a few others hold that 'prāṇa' means in the anoient Vedic literature expiration' and 'apāna' means 'inspiration', but that this meaning was revised in later days. On the other hand almost all Sanskrit commentators and writers and G. W. Brown, Edgerton and others hold the opposite view.2351 The present author agrees with the latter view viz. that 'prāṇa' meant and means inbalation or thoracic breath', while 'apāna' means 'abdominal breath. All scholars are agreed that those are certainly the meanings of the words prāna and apana in all classical Sanskrit literature, the opposite view being confined to the ancient period even by those who hold that prāṇa and apāna meant respectively "expiration' and 'inspiration'. We should as far as possible so construe all Upaniṣad passages as to yield the same sense consistently. The Praśna Up. (certainly an early Upaniṣad, though not among the earliest ones) contains the following interesting and rather decisive passage "just as the king appoints his officers saying '(each of) you should govern such and such villages', in the same way this prāṇa assigns to the other prānas separate spheres viz. apāna in the organs of excrement and generation, the prāṇa going in from the mouth and nose establishes himself (as king) in the eyes and ears, Samāna in the middle (of the spheres of Prāna and Apāna) i. e, in the navel, since it is he (Samāna) that carries the food offered (in the fire i, e, in the stomach) equally (to all bodily parts )." 

Caland, Dumont and others who hold that the word 'prāṇa' in ancient Sanskrit literature means 'expiration', chiefly rely on Saṅkarācārya's explanation of Chāp.2355 Up. I. 3. 3. (yadvai 

2354. Vide 2.. D), M. G. vol. 55 pp. 261-265 and vol. 56 pp. 556-558, J. A, O, S. vol. 39 (1919) pp. 104-112 on 'Prāna and Apāoaby G. W. Brown, J. A, O, S. vol. 77 (1957) pp. 46-47 by Prof. Damoat, J. A.O.S. vol. 78 (1958) pp. 51-57 (Prof, Dumont versus frof. Edgerton).

antarākarṣati vāyum' in Saṅkarabhāsya (on Chan. Up I. 3.3) only mean 'inhaling'; but that expression is capable of mean ing 'it draws the air into the inside of the body (i. e, in the abdomen) and what is more important, one has to note that the interpretation put on Saṅkara's words here by Caland, Dumont and others is directly opposed to Saṅkarācārya's own explana tions in several other passages of the Upaniṣads, such as Bļ. Up. I. 5. 3, III, 4. 1, Chan. Up. III, 13, 1-6, Katha 5. 3; Praśna III, 4-5 (vide note 2353). The bhāṣya on Bṛ. Up. I. 5.3 2356 remarks "Prāpa is an activity of the heart which moves about in the mouth and nose and is so called because it is led forth ; Apāna is a downward movement starting from the navel and is 80 called because it oasts out urine and excreta'. On Praśna Up. 111. 4 (quoted in n. 2353) the Saṅkarabhāṣya says the same thing about Prāpa and Apāna. Not only Saṅkarācārya but a much earlier authority viz. the Dharmasūtra of Devala (mentioned by Saṅkara, vide p. 1352 n. 2208 above) defines the working of Prāṇa and Apāna as done by Saṅkarācārya in his bhāṣya on Br. Up. I.5.3. 

In the Yoga system (which is based on the Upaniṣads ) prāṇa implies more than mere breath. It means vital energy, powers such as speech, eye, ear, manas in the body as well as in different forms in the universe. Its most perceptible manifestation in the human body is the movement of the lungs. The Y. S. inculcates on the yogic student the doctrine that by scientific control ( as laid down in it) of prāṇa in the body it is possible to obtain control over the deep-seated (and ordinarily imperceptible ) forces in human consciousness as well as in the external world.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXI 

The word 'pranayama 'does not occur in any of the principal Upaniṣads.7357 But it occurs frequently in the Sūtras. For example, the Ap. Dh. S. provides that if a householder 2355 is still asleep when the sun rises be should fast and keep silent that day (till night) and observes that, according to some ācāryas, he should continue to porform prāniyāma till he feels exhausted (by way of penance). The Gaut. Dh. S, states that if animals other than dogs, snakes, frogs and cata pass between the teacher and the pupil when the latter has sat down bofore the former for study, he ( pupil) should practise three prāniyāmas and should partake of some clarified butter (hy way of prāyaścitta). Similarly, it provides that if a person smells the odour from the mouth of one that has drunk liquor, he should perform ( 88 penance) three prāṇāyamas and should partake of clarified butter and that if a Vedic student chances to see an impure person like a Candāla, he should, after performing one Prāṇāyāma, look at the sun. Similarly, Baud. Dh. S. (IV.1.4-11, prose) provides prānāyāmas as expiation for gereral lapsos. 

The above examples show that in the times of the Sūtras (i, e. several centuries before the Christian era) the conception of prāpāyāma had been so doveloped as to hold that it was a sort of penance and religious rite for removing the taint attaching to acts and omissions that wore condemned by the then society. At this stage prāpāyāma appears merely to have been a religious act independent of any theory about its being one of the eight angas of yoga. 

To the five prānas mentioned in Vedic literature, the Purāṇas and other medieval works added five more prāpas with different 2359 names.

Prūnāyāına ex pluined in yoga-sutra 

1437 

It is now proper to see how the Y, S, defines and explains prāṇāyama. 'When the stability of posture has been assured (or secured) prāṇāyāma is the pause (lit. cutting off) in the movements of inhalation and exhalation'. The bhāṣya explaing * śvāss' as drawing in of the air which is outside one's body' and 'praśyāsa' as the expelling of the air in the trunk (or chest)' and the absence of both these is prāṇāyāma. This shows that the chief element in prāṇāyāma is the absence of both inhalation and exhalation i. e, kumbhaka in the technical language of yoga works. The next gūtra states that prāṇāyāma (the pause in movement) is of three kinds, viz. external, internal and suppressed. The idea is that Kumbhaka (stopping or pause) may be done after one has taken in air from outside (first kind) or after one has expelled air from the trunk (2nd kind) or when one is in a normal condition (i. e. neitber making an effort to fill his chest with air or emptying it of air) one may make a pause ( 3rd kind). Each of these may be regulated and considered from the point of the units of space, time (measurement by kalās or mātrūs) and numbers. Prāṇāyāma is called mṛdu (mild) when pause is kept up for 36 mātrās, then moderate one when kopt up for 72 mātrās and keen (tivra) when kept up for 108 matrās. When practised for days, fortnights and months, it is called protracted and when performed with great skill it is called sūkṣma (subtle ). 

In connection with prāṇāyāma we must look to Y. S. I. 34 also. That sūtra lays down that for securing the undisturbed calm of the mind one remedy is the expulsion and retention of the breath, 2360 It appears from that sūtra and its bhāṣya that vidhārana (retention of breath, I. e. Kumbhaka) is prāṇāyāma. 

Some explanation must be offered about desa (space), kāla and sankhya in relation to prāṇāyāma. Ordinarily a healthy grown-up man breathes in and out in about four seconds i, e. about 15 times a minute ( 21600 times in one day and night). In order to measure the force of the recaka a piece of cotton or : a thin thread is held at some distance from the nostrils and the . distance up to which the air driven from the nostrils makes the cotton or thread move or cease to move is measured by means of finger-breadths. As regards time several units of time are mentioned because in those ancient days there was no scientific

apparatus. The time taken for winking (niment) is equal 2161 to the time required for pronouncing & short vowel and this was called mulrū. The time taken for touching one's kneos thrice with one's hand and snapping the thumb and forefinger was also called mnātrā. Other units are passed over. The general rules are that both recuka and pīraka must be uniform and quiet, that the time given for pūraka should be half of that given to recaka. Three views about the duration of pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka are that they should be in the proportion of 1:4:2 or 1:2:2 or the same for all. The Puriṇas give different nātrās for prapāyāmas e. g. the Mārkaṇdeya (36. 13, 14 ) says that the laghu (mrdu of the bhāsya) is of twelve mātrās, double of that ia madhyama and the uttariya (tivra in the bhāsya) is for three times twelve mātrās, while the Garudapurāṇa (I. 226. 14-15) puts down the figures as 10, 20, 30 respectively and the Kūrma purāṇa ( II. 11. 32) agrees with the Mārkapdeya. The Mitakṣara on Yāj. III. 200-201 provides that prāṇāyāma is of three varieties (adhama of 15 mātrās, madhyama of 30 mātrās and uttama of 45 mātrās). The Lingapurāṇa (I. 8. 47-48) also puts forth 12, 24, 36 mātrās as the time of nici unghała, madhyama udghāta and mukhya and states that obvious results of these three are respectively perspiration, treinor and utthāna (prasāda-kampa. notthāna-janakaśca yathākramam). Compare Mārk, 36. 16 which states that those three are to be mastered respectively by the different lengths of prāṇāyāma (prathamena jayet svedam madhyamena ca repathuma / viṇādam hi tftiyena jayed-doṣan anukramāt 11). 

It should be noticed that neither Patañjali nor the Vyāsa bhāṣya employs the well-known words, piruka, recaka and

kumbhaka, but only śvāga, praśyāga and gativiccheda. 2362 Besides, Patañjali and Vyāsa say nothing about the japa of Om, Gayatri or Vyābśtis in prāṇāyāma, as the smṛtis and later medieval works do. A third matter to be considered is that in some later works rocaka, pūraka and kumbhaka are said to be three prāṇāyāmas and this latter is said to be of four kinds, three set out in Y. S. II. 50 and the fourth in II, 51. 

The words 'recaka', 'pūraka' and 'kumbhaka' also must be, however, regarded as ancient enough. They are mentioned and defined by the Dharmasūtra of Dovala 2363 referred to by

The word वृत्ति is to be connected with each of the three words बाह्य, आभ्यन्तर and स्तम्भ. Here the कुम्भक that follows रेचक is called बारावृत्ति and the one that comes after पूरक is called आभ्यन्तरवृत्ति. The कुम्भक that is made when there is neither रेचक nor पूरक is called स्तम्भवृत्ति.

Saṅkarācārya (vide note 2208 above). The Bphad-Yogi-Yaj, and Vacaspati also mention them. The Viṣnupurāṇa in a poetic description of the Sarad season employs them by way of śleṣa 2364 ( as below). Several modes of performing prāṣāyāma are prescribed. One of the simplest is to stop the right nostril with the thumb, to fill in air through the left nostril according to one's ability; then to throw out the air through the right nostril; again inhale through the right nostril and ejact air through the left. Do this at least thrice. Practise this at least twice every day, preferably in the morning after bath and in the evening or four times ( before dawn, during midday, in the evening or at midnight). In the beginning kumbhaka need not be practised at all. After some practice with pūraka and recaka, kumbbaka may be begun after recaka. Kumbhaka after pūraka is to be practised with great caution and should be attempted under the direction of an expert.

| The Manusmrti contains as a great eulogy of prāṇīyāma in the following words 'even threo prānāyāmas performed according to the rulcs prescribed and accompanied by the vyābritis and pruṇaru (the syllable om) should be regarded as the highest tapas for a brāhmaṇa; just as in the case of metals (like gold and silver) impurities are burnt when they are melted in the blast of a furnace, so blemishes (like passion &c.) of the organs of sense ( including the mind) are destroyed by the control of breath; one should extinguish the blemishes (passion, hatred &c.) by prāṇāyāmas, sin by dhāranū, contact with the objects of sense by pratyāhūra and such attributes as are ungodly (viz. anger, avarice, jealousy &c.) by meditation (on brahma). I he Y. 8. states that from the practice of prāṇāyāma results the dwindling of actions (or kleśas) that envelop enlightenment (which is the characteristic of saltva) and the

mind of the yogin becomes fit for fixed attention. 2866 The Gorakṣaśataka 2367 provides 'a yogin always eradicates diseases by Zsana, sin by prānāyāma and mental disturbance by pratyāhāra'. The Smrtis state that prāṣāyāmas have great efficacy in destroying sins. Madu XI. 248 ( =Vasiṣtha 26, 4, Baud. Dh. 8. IV, 1, 31 and Saṅkbasmrti XII. 18-19) states 

sixteen prāṇāyāmas performed everyday for a month together with the vāhrtis and pranava (om) purify even the murderer of a brāhmaṇa. Manu XI. 199 and 201 prescribe the performance of a single prāṇāyāma as a purification for light lapses or riding an ass or a camel and such incidents as being bitten by a dog, jackal, horse, camel, boar or man. Yaj. III. 305 prescribes the performance of a hundred prāṇāyāmas for the destruction of all sins, of upapatakas (lesser sing described in Yāj. III. 234–242) and of sins for which no specific prāyascitta is provided. Manu II. 83 (=Vasistha X, 5 and Visnudharmasūtra 55.83) states the one syllable (om ) is (the representative of) the highest brahma and prāṇāyāmas are the highest tapas'. 

It may interest readers to note that the great Jaina monk, ācārya Homacandra, condemns prāṇāyāmas by saying that they allow no rest to the mind, that there is physical effort in pūraka, kumbhaka and recaka and that prānāyāma is an obstacle to mukti. 2368 

In kumbhaka performed after pūraka the nerves, heart and lungs are under strain and permanent damage to these may result from careless or basty practice of kumbhaka after pūraka. Those suffering from lung or cardiac affections should not enter upon the practice of prāṇāyāma on their own initiative but must first consult an expert. Swami Vivekananda said long ago that all students of Yoga 2369 are expressly and earnestly reminded

that with few exceptions Yoga can safely be learnt by direct contact with a teacher'. The fact, that the Yogasūtra oon. taining 195 sūtras in all devotes only five sūtras (II. 49-53 ) to prāṇāyāma and that even these five are of a very general Dature, indicates that Patarijali intended that the yogio should not practise prāṇāyāma by merely listening to or reading those gūtras but should approach an expert yogin for instruction and guidance. 

It should be noticed that Patañjali does not require in his definition of prāṇāyāma the mental or inaudible repetition of any syllable like 'om' or any mantra like the Gayatrı. But the Smṛtis prescribe the practice of prāṇāyame every day in the Sandhyāvandada. Yāj. (I. 22 ) proscribes 2370 that a man of the three higher varnas must every day take a bath, perform mārjana (sprinkling water with kuśas) with the mantras (Rg. X. 9. 1-3 'apo hi ṣthā &c.'), practise prāṇāyāma, worship of the sun and japa of Gayatri (Rg. III. 62. 10) and that prāṇāyāma comprises the japa three times of Gayatri preceded by the Vyābstis, each being preceded by Om and followed by the firas. Prāṇāyāma as described by Yāj. is prescribed even in modern times for the morning and evening Sandbyā adorations. Prāṇā yama with mental repetition of 'Om' or a.mantra' is oalled 'sagarbha' 2171 or 'sabija,' while prāṇāyāma not so accompanied

is called 'agarbha' or 'abija' and it is said that "sagarbha' is the better of the two. Śāntiparva (304. 9. or. ed.=Ch. ed. 316.9-10) speaks of saguṇa and nirgupa prāṇāyāma. The Yogabhāsy & (on Y. 8. II, 52 ) quotes a passage 2372 6 there is no higher tapas than prāṇāyāma, therefrom arises purification of the taints and knowledge flashes forth.' 

The H. Y.P. speaks of eight kinds of Prāṇāyāma (in II. 44). The two most important ones, viz Ujjāyi and Bhastrikā are described by Sri Kuvalayananda in chap. IV. pp. 67-68 and chap. VI. pp. 101-115 respectively in his handbook on Prāṇā yāma, part one and the other six viz. Sūryabhedana, Sitkāri, Sitali, Bhramari, Mūrochā, Plāvini in. pp. 6–25 of the handbook part 2. H. Y.P. (II. 48-70) describes all the eight at some length 

Dr. Role in his work 'Mysterious Kundalini' provides at the very beginning & diagram of the autonomic nervous system according to the Western anatomical science, showing the six oakres and identifying the positions of those six and the sahasraracakra (lit. thousand-petalled i. e. having pumberless petals). He propounded an original view that the Kundalini is the right vagus nerve. His book is very interesting and he has explored a very large field of yogic practices. He has very thoroughly utilized his deep knowledge of Western anatomy and physiology, but he himself admits in his preface (p. 2) that the explanations of the various Yogio practices and phenomena given by him are possible suggestions only. But it may be noted that Sir John Woodroffe, who made a deep study of Yoga and of Tantra works and who wrote a foreword to Dr. Rele's work, was not prepared to accept Dr. Role's identification of Kundalini with the right Vagus Nerve (p. ii) and holds that Kundalint is not a nerve or any other physical substance or mental faculty but rather the Ground Substance of both (Forge word p. iii). Similarly, Shri Kuvalayanand (in his popular handbook on prāpāyāma part 1, p. 57 n. 3), after referring to Dr. Rele's admission about his explanations being possible sugges tions only, points out that Dr. Rele had not tried a single experi ment in the laboratory nor had be taken much oare to consult the practical experience of the students of Yoga and he states that to him the whole book of Dr. Role seems to be of doubtful scientific value. He goes further and apports that Swami

Vivekananda's lectures on Rajayoga suffer from the game draw. backs as the work of Dr. Relo does. Sri Kuvalayanand shows (on pp. 121-126 ) the value of pripāyāma for physical health and the proper functioning of the lungs, the organs of digestion, the liver, pancreas and kidneys and asserts that the spiritual value of Prāṇāyāma is very great. 

Pratyahāra (withdrawal of the sonse orgads from the objects of senso ) is defined 2373 in Y. S. II, 54 as 'when the senses have no contact with (are withdrawn from) their objecte (because the mind is restrained) and thereby resemble the state of the mind itself, there is pratyāhāra.' When the mind, being restrained by the yogin, does not come in contact with the objects of senge, viz, sound, touch, form, taste, smell, the organs of songe also become disconnected with them, the organs come to resemble the mind itself (hence the words anukāra iva' in the sutra). From this (non-contact) results the complete mastery over the senses, The idea is that in restraining the mind from the objects of sense the organs also are withdrawn from contact with them. Since the mind is made ekāgra (one-pointed) the sense organs together with the mind do not cognise or apprehend the objects. Pratyāhāra is the checking of the outgoing activities of the mind and freeing it from being the slave of the senses. The Sāntiparva (cr. ed. 188. 5-7 = Ch. ed. 195. 6-7) speaks of it. The Vigpupurāṇa in V. 10. 14 (in describing Sarad, i.e. autumn, states 'Sarad removed the turbidness of waters as pratyāhāra withdraws the organs from their objects') refers to pratyāhāra 2374

Pratyahāra explained 

1445 

as Indriyanindriyarthebhyaḥ pratyahāra ivāharat'.| Vacaspati quotes two verses from the Viṣnupurāna which employ the very characteristic words of the Y. S. and probably borrow the idea and language from the Y. 8. The Dharmasūtra of Dovala 2375 explains pratyahāra as establisbing (or yoking) the mind to the soul by bringing it back (to the soul) when it has swerved from the path of Yoga, because of its subtlety, its restlessness, its thoughtlessness or its force'. The Kūrmapurāṇa 2076 defines it as 'the suppression or mastery over the organs of sense that are naturally attracted to objects of sense'. Vide Sāntiparva (07. ed. 232. 13 ) also. 

It appears that when the Chan. Up. (in VIII. 15) opumeratos the circumstances which enable a person to reach the worlds of brahmu it has an idea of pratyābāra in the word 'atmani sarvendriyāṇi sampratisthāpya' (* when he concentrates all his senses in the self'). 

The third pāda of the Y. 8. is called 'Vibhati-pāda' (pada that deals with the super-pormal powers of the yogin), The word 'vibhūti' occurs in Praspa 5, 4 where it is stated that he who contemplates on Om of the dvimātra type is taken to the world of the moon where he enjoys 'vibhāti' and again returns to the earth. There the word probably means nothing more than prosperous life. The third pada first deals with the last three of the sight angas of Yoga, the first five being called bahiranga (indirect helpers of samprajñātajamādbi), while the last thras are said to be antaranga of samprajñāta-samadhi (but even these three are bahiranga with reference to pirblia Yoga, og be latter may occur oven in the absence of the three dhāraña' &c. These three are called dharapā, dhyāna and samadhi and these three when practised on the game object are called sarnyama, which is a technical term in the Yoga system. Vibhūtis are the results of samyama of various kinds. Instead of employing the three words dhāraṇa, dhyana and samadhi Patanjali explogs expressly or implied, the word gamyama' in most of the sāttas from 16 to 52 of the 3rd pāda.

Dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samadhi are said to be the direct auxiliaries of Yoga and are three successive stages, the preceding one leading to the next. Dhārapā is the holding of the mind to a certain spot or point 2377 or object. The bhāṣya explains that the mind is to be held down to such spots (in one's body) as the navel, the heart-lotus, the head, the light (in the eye), the tip of the nose, the tip of the tongue and the like or on external objects (such as images of gods in various forms). In this stage attention has to be firmly held upon the choson object for a period of timo determined by the will of the yoga aspirant. In this stage there are three elements, the subject, the objoot and the act of concentration. The next stage is dhyāna, which will be described immediately below. The Mārkandeya Purāṇa speaks of ton dhāraṇās on the different parts of the yogin's own body 3378 and is in accordance with the plural 'dhāraṇāsu ca yogyata manasah' (in Y. S. II. 53) employed by Patanjali himself. The Asvamedhikaparva also employs the plural 'dharanasu'. Vide the Santiparva (er. ed. 188.8-12 %D Ch. ed. 195.8). The Yajnavalkyasmrti 379 in a succint manner brings

The लिपु I. 8.42-43 appears to echo the words of यो.सू. in 'चित्तस्य धारणा पोक्ता स्थानबन्धः समासतः। ...तत्रैकचित्तताध्यानं प्रत्ययान्तरवर्जितम्।.' The Upanisads speak of the heart as lotus(vide above note 1717 and शराचार्य on वे. स. I. 3, 14-21 दहर उसरेग्य: &c.). ज्योतिषि probably refers to the Purusa in the eye (as in छा. VIII. 7.. or IV. 15. 1(य एषोऽक्षिणि पुरुषो दृश्यत एष आत्मेति होवाच) or the Lord in one's heart; वाचस्पति explains बाहो वा विषये by quoting several verses of the विष्ण. पुराण VI. 7. 77-85 where it speaks of contemplation on the form of Visma with a benign face, lotus-like eyes, wearing earrings and having the Srivatsa jewel on bis cbest, with four or eight long arms, wearing a yellow garment and holding conch, sāriga bow, mace,

in the argas from ābana to dhāraṇā and dhyana as follows: (The yogin) oocupying & sest neither too high nor too low, having placed his upturned heels on his thighs and having placed on the left (palm placad on the upturned right heel) his other (right) palm (turned upwards), having slightly Taised his face and having braced up his body with his (raised) chest, having closed the eyes, being free from rajas and tamas, not allowing the upper and lower rows of teeth to touch, holding his tongue firmly in the palate, and allowing no shaking of the body, covering the mouth, holding back the organs of sense from their objects, should perform prāṇāyāma of the twofold or threefold type (of 24 or 36 mātrās), should contemplete on the Lord that occupies his heart like a lamp, and fix his mind on that Lord by way of Dhāraṇā. Dovala states 2380 that dhārapa is the holding in check of the body, senses, mind, intellect and Ātman (egoism). 

M. Charles Baudouin in 'Suggestion and auto-suggestion' to, by Elder and Cedar Paul (od. of 1922, Allep and Unwin ) says (on p. 150). As one of the curiosities of history and further as a lesson in humility we must point out that the states just described under the names of collectedness, contention and auto hypnosis are described with considerable psychological acumen (though not in modern psychological terminology) in the precepts by which for centuries past the Yogis of Hindustan have been accustomed to attain to self-mastery and the author refers to Pratyāhāra and Dhāraṇā in this connection and on p. 151 remarks that auto-hypnosis is encountered in Yoga but it is tinged with mysticism because the sacred word 'om' is repeated hundreds of times. 

Dhyāna (contemplation) is the one-pointedness ( continuous flow) of the apprehension of the object contemplated upon,

unaffected by any other idea or apprehension. The Upaniṣads 2281 insiet upon dhyana, e. g. Mundaka says 'contemplate upon the Self in the form of Om'; the Br. Up. has the famous passage the self should be seen, heard, understood and reflected upon.' Tho Chan. Up. (VIL6.2) employs the word ' dhyana' in the sense of 'concentrating all thoughts on one object'. The Sv. Up. (I.3) mentions dhyānayoga and also Gita 18. 52 does so (dhyanayoga. paro nityam). The Santiparva (cr. ed. 188. 13 ff = Ch. ed. 195. 13-18) speaks of dhyāna, The Krtyakalpataru (on Moksa p. 181) quotes a long prose passage from Devala-dharmasutra about dhyana. The Vispupurāṇa 2382 closely agreeing with the Yogabhāsya in phraseology describes dhyāna as the one-pointed guccession of the apprehension of the Lord's form, unmixed with another idea, brought about by the practice of the first six angas of Yoga/Apararka (pp. 1025-27) quotes a long prose passage from Vishudharmasutra ( chap.97), which asks the yogin to contemplate upon the all-pervading and all-powerful Lord who is free from gupas (sattva, rajas, tamas), is beyond the twenty-four tattyas and who is imperceptible to the senses, and that, if he be unable to focuss his mind on formless God all at once, to

gradually rise up from Pșthyl and the other elements, mind, intellect, the soul, avyakta (upmanifested Spirit); if he be unable to do even this he should contemplate on the person that is like a lamp in his own heart (lotus); if this is impossible, he should contemplate upon the form of Vasudeva having on his chest vanamālā, having four arms, holding the conch, the quoit, mace and lotus; and adds that he secures whatever he contemplates upon and that this is the secret of dhyāna. This shows that dhyāna is either saguna or nirguna as stated by the Padmapurana IV.84, 80-86 (pirguna) and IV. 84. 88-96 ( saguna) or sūkāra and nirākūra (Padmapurāṇa, II, 80.70, 77-78). The Vispoparāṇa (VI. 7. 78-90) contains a passage similar to the Viṣnu Dh. S. Skanda (Kāśikhanda, chap. 41. 19) speaks of dhyāna as saguna and nirguna and defines saguna as depending on different forms or as accompanied by repetition of mantras and nirgupa as not depending on any particular form or as not accompanied by mantras'. The Narasimhapurāṇa (17. 11-28 and 26. 17) describes at some length the form in which Nārāyaṇa or Visnu is to be contemplated upon and these verses are quoted by the Krtya kalpataru (Mokṣa, pp. 191-192). The Saṅkha-smrti states that one has realization (darśana) of the Lord of gods that abides in the heart (of every person) by means of dhyānayoga and describes the mode of dhyāna. Dakṣasmrti also emphasizes dhyāna and jñāna (correct knowledge) and states that descrip tion of others serves no purpose beyond adding to the bulk of the workIn this stage there is only the duality of subject and object, there is no awareness of effort to tie down the mind on an object ( as in mere dhāraṇā ).

meditation is carried to & stage where the object contemplated upon alone appears and the meditator is not consolous of the idea of contemplation, because the object meditated upon entirely engulfs the meditator. The yogin becomes so much identified with the object meditated upon that he is not conscious that he is contemplating upon an object. This is what is meant by 'svarupasunyam-iva' (in Y. S. III. 3). In Samadhi the subject and object, the individual and Paramātman are completely blended into one, so that the consciousness of the subject as separate from object disappears. The word 'Samadhi' does not occur in any of the ancient Upanigads, though it is known to the Maitrayani Up. (vide n. 2327 above). The word Samadhi occurs in the Bhagavadgita (II. 53-54) and in Vanaparva (3. 11) and in Santiparva 195. 19-20, Cb. ed.). The Visnu. purapa2384 provides that it is called Samadhi when the mind grasps as a result of dhyāna the real nature of that (the Paramātman) in which there is absence of the separate apprehension (of the object to be meditated upon, the act of meditation and the meditator). The three (dhāraṇā, dhyāna and samadhi) are direct aids in samprajñāta-samadhi but they are indirect aids in asamprajñātasamādbi, as this last may follow without these. The Hathayoga-pradipika 2385 states that is called Samadhi where there is equality and oneness of the individual self and the Highest Self and where all desires cease to exist'. Sabija and nirbija samadhis would be equal to savikalpa and nirvikalpa samādhi defined by the Vedantasāra. There are soveral grades or stages in samadhi. There are four grades 2385 of Samprajnata

Four kinds of samadhi 

1451 

samadhi, viz. Bavitarka, pirritarka, savicāra, nirvloāra. Vide p. 1411 note 2318 above. The word gauḥ, the object cow denoted by it and the oonoopt or idea ( jõāna) 'this is a cow' are all really three separate matters, but they are apprehended as mixed up. When a yogin concentrates upon a gross object and his intellect is conscious of that object 28 permeated by all the above three, then that samadhi is savitarka (Y. S. I, 42). For the others vide note 2318 and below. In the asamprajñāta Samādhi, the ultimate reality dawas on the yogin, praksti does not affect him in any way, his soul which abides in itself and is not conscious of personality and even of joy is all cit or citeakti and nothing else. In this section about the influence of yoga on Dharmaśāstra it is not necessary to go deeply into the several stages of samadhi described in the yoga works. The Gorakṣaśataka 2387 describes the final stage of samadhi as follows: 'A yogin in Samadhi does not apprehend smell, flavour, form, touch or sound nor does he apprehend him self or others ( as distinct); kaowers of brahma hold it to be pure, immovable, eternal, not engaged in activities, free from the guṇas, expansive like the sky, as intelligence and bliss; the knower of yoga teaches non-duality in the highest stage as milk poured in milk, ghee into ghee or fire into fire.' 

It would have been noted that in dharānā, dhyāna and samadhi the principal emphasis is mental. External conditions do help in the training but they are subsidiary. As noted above (pp. 1421–22 ) cleanliness, contentment, austerities (tapas), sexual purity, certain easy postures and living in detachment, restrictions as to quantity and quality of food-these are the chief physical or external conditions. While the yogin practises the above three he may develop certain super-Dormal powers which he is advised to ignore, as they are hindrances in the attainment of his goal ( Yogasūtra III. 36). Though this is the opinion of Patanjali, from the fact that with most yogins the siddhis are an important part of yoga doctrines and the fact that, out of 195 sūtras of the Yogasutra, 35 (III. 16-59) are devoted

to the description of siddhis, the present author is constrained to gay that siddhis are an integral part of Yoga. The Vaikhānasa. smārtasutra says that the yogin can vanish from people, can 800 distant objects and hear in spite of great distance. 

It is unnecessary to dwell upon the results of all santyamas mentioned in Y. S. pāda three. A few are cited by way of sample. By saiyama on the power of an elephant one socures the strength of an elephant (111. 24), by samyama on the sun there arises the knowledge of the soven worlds (11I. 26 ) and by samyama on the moon, there arises knowledge of the arrange ment of the stars (III. 27), by samyama on the navel cakra arises knowledge of the arrangement of the body (III. 29, viz. the three doṣcze, rāta, pilla, kapha and the seven dhātus viz. skin, blood, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow and somen). By samyama on the coarse 2388 forms, the essential attributes (svarūpa), the subtle form (tanmātrās), the inherence (anvaya) and the pur. posiveness of the five elements results the conquest (or mastery over) elements and from this results the appearance of the per fections called anıma and others, perfection of body and non obstruction (of the actions of the yogin by the qualities of the elements i. e, the earth cannot prevent the yogin by its hardness from penetrating inside the earth's rocks nor can fire burn him &c.). In IV. 1 Patañjali states that supernormal powers (siddhis) arise in five ways viz. by birth in certain 2389 bodies

The siddhis have been enumerated and explained above on pp. 1112-13. The Davaladharmagūtra has a long note on siddhis, which is quoted in Kalpataru (Moksakāṇda pp. 216-217). 239 The Yājñavalkya smrti (III. 202-203) enumerates some charac teristio signs of Yogasiddhi, viz. becoming invisible to others, remembrance of incidents in past lives, charming appearance, ability to see past and future happenings or objects that are distant, knowing what is being said at a great distance, entering another body after leaving one's own body, creation of things at one's will (without possessing the appropriate materials ). 

A great deal has been said above on mantras under Tantra (pp. 1096-1107 and notes thereto ). There are two theories about mantras , one is the vibration theory, viz. that the letters of the mantra are charged with certain powers by the original composer and user of it and when the mantra is repeated certain imperceptible vibrations are set up which help in securing the purpose for which the mantra is repeated. The other theory is that the mantra comes down from antiquity and from

It is not clear whether A, Koestler was aware of this statement.

a great sage and its power of suggestion is great. But the real effective power of a mantra seems to the present au thor to depend far more on the knowledge, the responsiveness and the high spiritual level which the person who repeats it brings to bear on its use. No scientific tests have been employed and different works emphasize with exaggeration one of the two theories about mantras. All is speculation. The present author believes that the 2nd theory has greater elements of trust-worthi ness than the first, as it relies on human psychology, while the first degenerated so much that the famous mantrus 'om mapi padne hūm' (dedicated to Avalokitesvara) written on some material and pasted on a whoel which was turned round and round hundreds of times was supposed to yield great results, The 2nd theory led to the importance of guru and dikṣā (initiation) and here also extravagant claims were made. This latter theory, however, required that the disciple should possess certain qualifications such as implicit faith in the guru, respect for matters spiritual, some knowledge of the tenets and the basio scriptures and readiness to devote time and energy to the study and practice of the teachings of the guru. Vide Siva-samhita (III. 10-19 ) for the relation between guru and disciple. 

The fourth pūda deals with Kairalya. The yogin who has gone through the whole discipline up to samadhi and has become thoroughly aware of the distinction between Puruṣa and the guṇas ( sattva and others), becomes free from the influence of the three guṇas, because they merge in Pradhāna after having served the purpose of the soul, that is Kaivalya (isolation) or it (Kaivalya) may be stated to be the principle of consciousness that abides by itself (and does not become connected with even sa!tru-guna). 2391 This has also been alluded to in Y. S. II, 25 that states that when aridyā (nescience) is removed by discri mination the self (who is the perceiver) does not come into contact with the guṇas, which state is Kaivalya, 2392 Kaivalya

is put forword in IV. 34 from two points of view. When a puruṣa ceases to be affected in any way by the guṇas (that constitute prakrti) because he has become entirely passionless, praksti becomes aloof ( kevala) so far as that purusa is concerned. When puruṣa has thorough knowledge and ceases to be affected by guṇas he remains as bare consciousness (citisakti) and remains aloof (kovala ) and that is the 2nd point of view about kaivalya. In that state of kaivalya or mokṣa we cannot predicate any happiness or bliss about him but we can only gay about him that he is in a state of bare consciousness (citisakti... The Upaniṣads declare 239 that in such a state the liberated soul has neither joy nor sorrow, that happiness or its opposite does not touch such an one, since he has risen above identifying the body with himself. The ideal of Yoga is to be jIvan-mukta (i. e. to reject Life and Personality, to die to this world though the body may persist for some time ). 

| The eight angas of Yoga are described in more or less detail in 'several Purāṇas. Vide Agni, chap. 214–215 and 372-76, Bhāgavata III. 28, Kūrma II. 11, Narasimha 61 (verses 3–13 of which are quoted by Kalpataru, mokṣakāṇda pp. 194–195), Matsya chap. 52, Mārkandeya (chap. 36-40 of Venk, edition, 39-43 of Cal. ed.) about 250 verges, many of which are quoted by Kṛtyakalpataru (on Mokṣa), Aparārka and others; Linga 1. 8., Vāyu, chap. 10-15, Viṣṇu VI. 7 (which closely follows the Y.

Geraldine Coster in 'Yoga and Western Psychology' (Oxford Uni. Press, 1934) observes 'I am convinced that the ideas on which Yoga is based are universally true for mankind and that we have in the Yoga-sūtras a body of material whichi we could investigate and use with infinite advantage (p. 244)... My plea is then that Yoga as followed in the East is a practical method of mind development, quite as practical as analytical therapy and far more practical and closely related to real life than the average university course. I am convinced that the Yogasūtras of Patañjali do really contain the information 238 that some of the most advanced psychotherapists of the present day are ardently seeking '(p. 245).

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sec. VIII, Ch. XXXII 

The last chapter in Dr. Behanan's book on 'Yoga, a scientific evaluation' is interesting and important. He makes an appraisal of several aspects of Yoga by means of experiments which he carried out on himself after spending one year under the guidance of Swami Kuvalayanand of Lonavla and after he had three years of experience in Yogic breathing. It is not possible for reasons of space to give here a summary of his appraisal of several aspects of Yoga but reference may be made to a fow of his findings. He finds that by yogic practices the mind is turned joward and detached from the external world (p. 232), it seems to him very probable that the prāṇāyāmic breathing induces a state of relaxation, thereby inducing the mind to take an inward course (p. 234 ), that taking normal breathing as a basis of comparison it was found that oxygen consumption increased 24,5 per cent in Ujjāyi, 18. 5 per cent in Vlistrikū and 12 per cont in Kapālabhāti; that the nasal gaze in & meditative posture is an aid to checking the wandering propensities of the mind (p. 242), that Yogic practices lead to an emotional stability and that watching at close range for a year the daily lives of more than half a dozen practitioners of yoga Dr. Behanan concluded that they were the happiest personalities that he had known and that their serenity was contagious (p. 245). 

Dr. P. A. Sorokin of the Harvard University, one of the greatest living sociologists, contributes a very valuable paper on "Yoga and man's transfiguration to the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Journal for November 1958 (pp. 111-120), the very first sentence of which opens with tha words 'The methods and techniques of the yoga, particularly those of the Rājayoga, contain in themselves nearly all the sound techniques of modern psycho-analysis, psychotherapy, psycho-drama, moral education, and education of character.' 

That a person engaged in Yoga practices is succeeding in reaching higher and higher spiritual lovels is shown by the appearance of certain traits in himself. The Sv. Up, states that the first favourable signs of the working of Yoga are: lightness Or agility of body, health, freedom from desires, brightness of complexion, fineness of voice, pleasant bodily odour, passing only a small quantity of urine or excreta. Almost the same Verse occurs in the Vayu 2394 and the Mārkandeya Puranas and

Mārkandeya further says 'people come to like the yogin and sing praises of his qualities behind his back and all animals are not afraid of him; he is not affected by severe cold or heat and is not afraid of others; these show that siddhi in Yoga is approaching.' The Vāyupurāna adds "if the practitioner of Yoga sees the earth or his body as if on fire and if he sees him self entering the elements (or all beings) he should understand that suocess in Yoga is near.' 23 

The Mārkandeya-purāṇa (chap. 38 Ferse 26 ) and the Viṣnu purāṇa II. 13 describe at some length yogicarya (ia behaviour or conduct of a yogin). It is not possible to get out all that is said in these chapters but two striking Ferses are rendered here The Mārkandeya 239 says honour and disrespect cause pleasure and distress to man (in general), but these two bave the reverse effect and serve to produce perfection in the yogin; these two are called poison and nectar respectively; disrespect is nectar for the yogin and honour is terrible poison.' The Visnupurāns emphasizes that a yogin should so act that people will disrespect him and would not seek his company. The Manusiniti (in 

VI. 38-85) enlarges upon the duties of sannyāsins, many of which are applicable to yogins. In VI, 65 Manu calls upon the sannyāsin to ponder by means of Yoga over the subtlaneas of the Highest Self and in VI, 73 Many advises the ascetic to practise dhyanayoga. The Yājñavalkyasmiti ako (in III. 56-67) prescribes the duties of sannyāsins, one of which (in Verse 64) is the same as Manu VI. 73,

when he ourbs the senses by his mind and makes the mind itself firm by his intellect and he becomes unmoved (by objects of BONBO) as if he were a stone, is unshakable like a tree-trunk, strong and motionless liko & mountain. The wise call a man yukta (a yogin), when he neither hears, nor smells fragrance, nor tastes nor sees, nor touches and when his mind does not form (ever changing ) ideas, when he does not regard anything as his own, when he does not cognise ( external objects) as if he were a log of wood and when he can be said to have recovered the original real nature (of the Self). The Devaladharmasūtra provides that all beings come under bondage owing to alankārn (egoism that one will do this or that) and maiatza (regarding transiont things as owned by oneself) but he who is free from these becomes liberated. 2398 

Through centuries Sannyasins and Yogins have been paid the highest honours in India. Special emphasis is laid on inviting a Yogin at a śrāddha and it is said by some authorities that a single yogin is equal to hundreds and thousands of brāhmaṇas. Vide H. of Da. Vol. IV. pp. 388, 398-399 for original authorities. In cases of doubt as to what the proper conduct or Dharma is in a set of circumstances, the matter was loft to be decided by E pariṣid (an assembly ) of ten learned brābmaṇas or at least three, but even one may constitute a pariṣad, provided he is learned in Veda and knows Dharma (vide Manu XII, 108–113). But Yaj. I. 9 and others say that four persons knowing the Veda and Dharmaśāstra or three of the same type or even one who is the best among knowers of spiritual matters (ascetics) may constitute a pariṣad and what he declares would be the right course of conduct. Vide H. of Dh. VOL. II. 969 for texts on this point, The Bhagavad-gitā says 'the yogin (who is a real karmayogin surrendering the

Manu (XII, 83) states 'study of the Veda, tapas, true knowledge (about brahma), restraint of the sense organs, ahiñsā, attending on one's guru-these are the highest means of nihśreyasa (i.e. mokṣa). Then verge 85 proceeds of all these six means true knowledge of the Self is the highest, it is at the head of all vidyās (lores), since immortality (mokṣa) is obtained by means of it. 

The highest value is attached to Yoga 2399 as an integral part of Vedanta by the Yājñavalkyasmrti when it states that realization of the Self by means of Yoga is the highest Dharna. Then the same Smrti provides 2400 study of the Veda, perform ance of sacrificos, brahmacarya ( sexual purity), tapas and dama (restraint of senses), faith, fasting and freedom from attach ment to worldly objects; these are the causes of securing know ledge of the Atman,' It should be noticed that some of these fall under yama, niyama and pratyāhūra. The Dakṣasmrti avers 

even the country, where & yogin, who has profound know ledge of yoga and who is given to dhyūna, becomes holy; what need is there to say about his relatives (i. o. they will certainly be pure). 2401 

The Yogasūtras are difficult and do not give complete explanations of the several stages of Yogic practices. They are in the nature of brief notes or hints that are calculated to rouge the curiosity of the hearer or reader and induce him to go to a competent teacher and learn Yoga practices. A few examples may be cited. Y. S. II. 50 refers to three kinds of Prāṣāyāmas, and II. 51 mentions & fourth (bāhyābhyantaraviṣayāksepi caturthah). There is no further explanation of this 4th variety. In IV. 1 Patañjali lumps together siddhis arising from janma, oṣadhi, mantra, tapas and samadhi. There is a vast difference

between a siddhi due to a drug and siddhis due to samadhi. Patañjali says that one is the symbol of Isvara and that repeti lion thereof and reflection on its meaning is a means of attain. ing ekāgratā, but there is no explanation why Om is expressive of Isvara nor is any reference made to the Upaniṣads &c. about the importance of Om or how japa is to be performed. This is probably due to the agelong tradition that spiritual knowledge should be kept secret, should not be taught to all and sundry, but only to a disciple possessing certain qualifications, Already on pp, 1071-72 notes 1733, 1734 it has been shown from a fow Upaniṣad quotations how esoteric knowledge was imparted only by a guru to a disciple. In the dialogue of Yājāavalkya and Artabhāga (Bṛ. Up. III. 2. 13), when the latter asked, after saying after a man's death his speech enters fire, his breath enters into wind, his eye into the sun, his body into the earth' ' where does thon the man remain?' Yājāavalkya replied take my hand, on this matter we two alone must come to some understanding, but not here in the midst of company.' Then the two went aside and conferred with one another. That shows that the knowledge about what happens after death was not held to be a matter proper for being discussed in an assembly of people. The Chāndogya Up. (III. 11. 5) states therefore a father may tell that doctrine of Brahma to his eldest son or to a worthy pupil but not to anyone else even if the latter gave him this earth girt by waters (seas) and full of wealth, for this doctrine is worth more than that'. The Bṭ. Up. VI. 3. 12 provides one should not speak of it (brahma doctrine) to one who is not his son or pupil'; vide Sv. Up. VI. 22, Maitrāyaṇi Up. VI. 29 for similar words. The Sāntiparva in a chapter dealing with spiritual knowledge provides that it should be imparted to one's dear son and an obedient disciple, but not to one whose mind is not quiescent nor controlled, nor one who is jealous or crooked or a backbiter or a logic-chopper,2x02 H. Y. P. states & Yogin desirous of attaining siddhi should keep the knowledge of Hatha as highly secret; it becomes potent if kept secret, but becomes impotent if exposed to all; one should practise yoga alone in the way expounded by the guru '. 2403 This applied in ancient

times not only to esoteric knowledge but to other scholastic studies. The Nirukta (IL. 3) says that it (Nirukta) should not be taught to one who does not know grammar, nor to one who does not approach (the guru) for knowledge or who is not aware of the importance of the śāstra, since an ignorant person always beara ill-will to knowledge; and the Nirukta quotes (II. 4) four verses (called Vidyāsūkta) on this matter, 2404 In the Bhagavad gitā Krṣpa frequently emphasizes that the knowledge of Bhakti. yoga is a sovereign secret ( IX %), in XVII. 63 the knowledge conveyed to Arjuna is stated to be more secret than all secreta and in XVIII, 64-65 Kșṣpa asks Arjuna to listen to the most secret words of his viz. "fix they mind on Me, be my dovotes, offer sacrifice to me, prostrate thyself before me; thou shalt come to me; I promise to theo truly as thou art dear to me! This last is repeated from IX. 34. At the end of shap. XV it ia said 'o blameless one! this most secret doctrine has been ex. pounded by me to you'. 

Whether the path of Yoga is desirable or feasible in its entirety cannot be debated here. But thors have been great men in India for thousands of years who have trodden the path of Yoga that led to the desired goal of freedom of the self from i vidyā and the bondage of birth and death by means of Yoga, Even as early as the Santiparva (chap. 289, cr. ed. verses 50 and 54), the path of yoga is said to be very difficult and that it is easy to stay on the sharp edges of razors, but that those whose souls are not purified would find it difficult and painful to continually practine Dhāraṇās. Kālidāsa so finely describes in the 8th canto of the Raghuvarsa ( verses 16-24) how Yoga was practised by king Raghu. Kalidasa refers (in VIII, 16) to apavarga as the goal of the ascetic Raghu 88 contrasted with mahodaya ( abhyudaya or bhoga), both words occurring in Y. 8. II. 18 (prakāśa ... ... bhogāpavargārtham drāyam); mentions dbāraṇā (in VIII. 18), pranidhāna practice and consequent mastery over the five prāṇas (in Raghu VIII. 19, Y. 8. II. 45 

• samādhisiddhiriśvara-prapidhānāt); mastery over the three guṇas that constitute prakti (Raghu VI, 21. Y. 8. H. 48 mentions pradhānajaya), Yogavidhi as a means of paramal madarsana (Raghu VIII, 2%, Yaj. smrti I. 8 quoted in note 2399).

Rājayoga holds the supreme goal to be liberation from Nature (prakrti) or Maya of the Advaita) and its attitude towards the world of senses and our empirical life is that of shunning these. Mukti means absorption into brahnu for the Vedantist or Kaivalya ( isolation of the Individual self from the boods of birth and death and from praksti according to pure Yoga). For the vast majority of men and women the path and final goal of Pātañjala Yoga or of the Advaita Vedānta are almost inaccessible and unattainable, as the Gita itself states (XII.5) "Those whose mind is set on the Unmanifested encounter greater difficulties (than those who worship & personal God), since the goal of the unmanifested is hard to coach by embodied beings'. The path of Karmayoga (performing good deeds and acts prescribed by Śāstra without hankering for rewards) and Bhaktiyogn (wherein there is deep devotion to God and self-surrender) appear to be more suitable and practical for ordinary human beings. The Gita in chap. XIII. (verses 13-17) contains one of the best descriptions of God as transcendent and immanent and verse 18 adds that the devotee of God who under stands this reaches God. 

Many readers familiar with Shri Aurobindo's ātrama at Pondicherry and his voluminous writings might express surprise at the present author's non-mention (in what precedes) of Shri Aurobindo (who is called Mahāyogi by his disciples and admirers) in this section on Yoga and its influence on Dharma śāstra. But the reasons are obvious. In the first place, Shri Aurobindo says hardly anything about Dharmaśāstra in relation to Yoga. In the 2nd place, Shri Aurobindo admits that he had 'no touch from a guru', that he got an inner touch and practised Yoga, that he got some help from Mr. Lele of Gwalior, that when he came to Pondicherry he got from within a programme for his sādhanī, that he could not make much progress as to the help to be given to others and that when the Mother (Mira Richard ) came to the ūśrama in 1920 he found with her aid the method of helping others. In the next place, he departs from the teachings of a galaxy of Sanskrit writers on Yoga, viz, that & yogin must shun woman (vide p. 1421 and note 2330), while his biographer Mr. Diwakar states that the Aurobindo Ashram was founded on 24th November 1926, that the Mother was entirely in charge of it from that day and that Shri Aurobindo thencs forward cut off all contacts except through the Mother (p. 257). In this, he strikes an entirely new line and appears to ordinary 

Shri Aurobindo 

1463 

men like the prosent author to have diverged far from the well trodden path of ancient Yoga and become like one described in the well-known words ('Murārostrtiyaḥ panthāh'). Shri Aurobindo is a mystic, 2405 the experiences of mystics are peculiar and their own, ordinary words and modes of speech fail to communicate thom to those that cannot claim to have over shared such experiences. Aurobindo became a recluse from November 1926 to his Mahāsamādbi on 5th December 1950 and gave darśana 2406 only on four days in the year viz. 15th August (his birth date.), 24th November ( day of victory for him), 21st February ( the birth date of the Mother) and 24th April the day of the Mother's coming to the Ashrama (vide Mr. Diwakar's 'life of Mahāyogi' p. 265). For forty years Aurobindo lived in Pondicherry. His Ashram became a centre of the gospel of integrated Yoga and a home for those who sought real life and light, a place of pilgrimage for men and women attracted by his teachings. 

On 15th August 1947 when India attained Independence (which happened to be the date of Aurobindo's birth ) he issued a long statement referring to the dreams of his youth, which he thought were arriving at fruition or were on their way to achievement. He stated the first of these dreams was a revolu tionary movement which would create a free and united India. Another dream was the resurgence and liberation of the peoples of Asia and her return to her great role in the progress of human civilization. The third dream was a world union forming the outor basis of a fairer, brighter and nobler life for all mankind. A catastrophe may intervene and interrupt or destroy what is being done; but even then the final result is sure. For unifica

Leuba defiaes it as follors; "Mysticism means for us any experience taken by the experiencer to be a contact (aot through the senses, but immediate or intuitive) or anion of the self with a larger than self, be it called the World Spirit, God, the Absolute or other wise" ('Paychology of religious mysticism,' Kegan Paul, 1929). In a recent work Mysticism, sacred and profane' Prof. R. C. Zaehner (Oxford, 1957) says 'Mysticism is the realization of unity' (p. 144) and translates and examines Chān. Up. VI. 9,1-4, Br. Up. II. 3-6. III. 7.1. ff. Bhagavadgitā II, 53-72 (pp. 136–145 ) for that purpose.

Another dream, the spiritual gift of India to the world, has already begun; India's spirituality is entering Europe and America in an ever-increasing measure. The final dream was a step in evolution which would raise man to a higher and larger con sciousness and begin the solution of the problems which have perplexed and vexed him since he began to think and to drearu of individual perfection and a perfect society. Here too, if the evolution is to take place, since it must proceed through a growth of the spirit and the inner consciousness, the initiative can come from India and, although the scope must be universe!, the central movement may be hors', 

These emotional and eloquent words are flattering to the pride of all Indian people, but it is possible that, bearing in mind that the whole of India was mostly under the boel of ruthless or exploiting conquerors for over seven hundred years from the 13th century A. D. (except for some parts and for brief periods as under the Vijayanagar Empire or under the Marathas for about 150 years and for about 50 years under Maharaja Ranjit Singh in Panjab) these proud assertions of Aurobindo are likely to bring derisive smiles on the faces of many non Indian readers. It is for discerning Indian readers to judge whether any of the dreams of Shri Aurobindo (except the first about 2407 Independence) are on the way to achievement or realization, whether during the last fourteen years after Independ ence India has progressed in the way of spirituality among men in general, whether there is any likelihood of there being a union of peoples and nations in the near future or whethor the world is on the brink of a precipice. 

Shri Aurobindo had set his heart on the unity of the human race by an inner oneness and purpose and not by an external association of interests ; for 24 years he completely withdrew from the outer world and gave darśana only on four days in the year. What efforts he made for the inner oneness of the human race except by his writings is not clear and nor does it appear that in the community of men and women that gathered under bis leadership and influence at Pondicherry any one occupied

a pre-eminent position and energetically and fruitfully pursued the path marked by the Master and carries on the work that the master dreamt of and left unattempted and unfinished. Pass ages quoted from his letters by Shri Diwakar (on p. 258) clarify what visions he had there will be first a race representing the supermind as man represents the mind', 'in what I am trying to do the spiritual realization is the first necessity, but it cannot be complete without an outor realisation also in life, in mon in this world, spiritual consciousness within but also spiritual life without'. About his Sadhanā he says 'I began my Yoga in 1904. My Sadhanā was not founded upon books but upon personal experiences that crowded on me from within...... It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the Jail' (p. 131 of Mr. Diwakar's book). 

In a letter to his brother Barindra dated 7th April 1920 which is set out in full on pp. 309-314 in the work 'Sri Auro bindo on himself and on the Mother' (1953), Aurobindo esserts 'the main defect in the old Yogas consisted in the fact that they know mind and intelligence and the Atman; they used to be satisfied with spiritual experience on the mental level; but the mind is capable of only partial knowledge and it can comprehend only parts and not the whole. The mind can know the infinite and the total reality only through Samadhi, Moksha or Nirvana and by no other means. Of course, some people do attain this kind of Moksha which may be said to be a blind alley. But then what is the use of it? But what the Bhagwan intends to do with man is to enable him to realize God in life, in the in dividual as well as in the collective society (to manifest God in life). The old systems of Yoga could not bring about & synthesis or unity between spirituality and life; they disposed of the world calling it Māyā or the transitory play of the Lord. The result is vitality and vigour in life have been sapped and India has decayed'. In this passage Aurobindo tries to bring out the distinotion between his integral Yoga and the Yoga of ancient and medieval Indians. There is hardly anything very new in his theory of Yoga The Gita also says the same in . ajčānenāvśtam' (Gita V, 15), in "utsideyur-ime loka' (Gita II. 24-25, II. 47, III. 8, 19, LX, 27, XVIII. 45–46, all of which emphasize that disinterested work is worship of God). Aurobindo should have brought into being an organised body of workers after his own heart. The Patañjala Yoga does not employ the

word Māyā at all nor did it say that the world was a play of God. It was the Vedanta-sūtra II, 1, 33 (lokavat-tu lilakaivalyam) that said go by way of ropelling an objection. In the Patañjala yoga Iyara has nothing to do with the creation of the world (vide abovo pp. 1402-3) but it speaks of avidyā by which the individual self is enmeshed (Y. S. II. 3-5 and 24) and not God or the Supreme Self. Besides one is tempted to sobo the question of Aurobindo himself What is the use of integral Yoga, mind, overmind and supermind?' Can anybody point out even half & dozen men and diariples of Aurobindo who have devoted all their energies to the regeneration of the country and of the human race on his lines? The position of the Ashram itself is rather vague, anomalous and undefined. But it is unnecessary to say in this work anything further about it. 2408 

The writings of Shri Aurobindo are numerous and voluminous. For & list of his writings along with a few other works, vide the Bibliography (pp. 267–269 ) given by Shri Diwakar at the end of his work 'Mahāyogi'. The present author bas read only the following works of Shri Aurobindo 'Yoga and its objects' (1938, a brief work in which 'adhyātma Yoga' is said to be higher than Hathayoga and Rajayoga); The Mother' (1937), 'Essays on the Gita (5th ed. of 1949), 'The Synthesis of Yoga'(1948) which attempts to show that all three paths, viz. of knowledge (Jõānayoga), of Devotion ( Bhaktiyoga) and of Divine works ( Karmayoga) can be integrated; "the problem of Rebirth'(published by the Aurobindo Ashram in 1952 after his passing away); 'Foundations of Indian culture' (essays brought together in one volume, revised by Shri Aurobindo), Now York, 1953; Aurobindo's Magnum Opus is 'Life Divine (originally in three volumes, now available in one of 1272 pages, published by the Aurobindo International University Contre, Pondicherry 1955). The prosent author has read only the first volume of this last work. Men of ordinary intelligence like the present writer find this philosophical work not easy to read, and are often at a loss to find out, in the flood of high sounding phrases used by Shri Aurobindo concerning the mind, overmind, 

2408. I have to acknowledge my obligations to two biographies of Sri Aurobindo, one by G, H. Langley (former Vice-Cbancellor of Dacca Valver sity) published in 1949 and 'Mahāyogi' (on the life, Sadhana and teachings of Aarobiado) written by Shri R. R, Diwakar and published by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavag is Bombay, 1953. There is an interesting work published by the Aurobindo lateraatiooal University Centrs at Pondicherry called 'Sri Aurobindo on himself and on the Mother'(1953)

supermind, his precise meaning. Only one sentence is cited here for sample (from p. 345 of the big one volume edition); 'Overmind, intuition, even supermind not only must be principles inherent and involved in the Inconscience from which we arise in the evolution and inevitably destined to evolve, but are secretly present, oocult actively with flashes of intuitive emergence in the cosmic activity of mind, life and matter. The present author regards the book 'Foundations of Indian culture as the best of the works of Shri Aurobindo which he has read. Prof. R. D. Ranade in his Lectures on 'Bhagavadgitā as a philosophy of God Realization' (Nagpur, 1959 pp. 163-176) submits to examination Aurobindo's 'Essays on the Gita' and disagrees with him on some points. While these pages were passing through the press the present writer received a copy of 'Integral Philosophy of Aurobindo', & symposium edited by Dr. Haridas Chaudhuri and Dr. Frederic Spiegelborg (and published by Allen and Unwin, 1960), which contains 30 papers written by Indian and Western scholars on the Philosophy of Aurobindo, p. 32 defining the eggence of integral Yoga and p. 44 distinguishes between 'mind' and 'supermind' (of Aurobindo's philosophy).
