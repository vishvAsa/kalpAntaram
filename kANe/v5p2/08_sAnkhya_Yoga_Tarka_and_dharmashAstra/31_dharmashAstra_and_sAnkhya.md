SECTION VIII Relation of Sāikhya, Yoga and Tarka to Dharmaśāstra 

CHAPTER XXXI Dharmaśāstra and Saṅkhya. 

Sāokhya is one of the well-known six yarārenns (philoso phical points of view). 

Saṅkarācārya in his bhagya 2208 on V. S. II. 2. 17 says that Manu and others who were deeply versed in the Veda took up to some extent in their works the doctrine of pralhūna being the cause of the world with the idea of relying on that part of its doctrine viz. the effect is (already) existent in the cause. Similarly, on V, S. I. 4.38 he says that great effort was made by the Sūtrakāra and himself for refuting the doctrines of the Sāṅkhya system (and not for the refutation of the theory of atoms being the cause of the world), since the Sāṅkhya system is near to the Vedānta as it accepts the view of the non-diffor. ence of cause and effect and as some Dharmasūtra writers like Dovala have had resort to it in their works. On V. S. II. 1. 3 Saṅkarācārya remarks that, though there are many smrtis dealing with metaphysical topics, great effort was made for the refutation of Saṅkhya and Yoga only, since the two systems are well-known in the world as means of securing the highest goal of man, as they have been accepted by śistas (respectable and learned people) and are supported by Vedic indications in their favour (as in svetāśvatara Up. 'tat-kāraṇam sānkhyayogabhi pannam' VI. 13). It would be shown later on that Manu and Devala rely on and propound ( somo) Sāṅkhya doctrines.

Origin and development of Saṅkhya 

1353 

It would not be irrelevant to say a few words about the origin and development of the Saṅkhya system. This (rise of Saṅkhya) is one of the most difficult problems in Indian philo sophy. A good many works and papers have been written on the Saṅkhya system. 2109 As to what the original Sāṅkhya teaching revised in the Sāṅkhyakārikā of fśvarakrsna was, no generally accepted answer can be given. From the 5th century A, D. at least the Saṅkhyakārikā of Iśvarakrsna has been re garded as the foremost exponent of the Sārkhya. The Saṅkhya kārikā and a commentary on it were translated into Chinese about 546 A. D. by Paramartha, originally a brāhmaṇa of Bhāradvāja gotra and a śramaña from Ujjayini (vide BEFEO, 1904, p. 60). Saṅkarācārya on V. S. I, 4, 11 quotes the whole of the 3rd perse of the Sāökbyakārikā and the first quarter of it on V. S. I. 4. 8. But the Sāṅkhya system, it appears, went through several phases. Chinese sources say that there were eighteen Sāṅkhya schools (p. 2 of Johnston's "Early Saṅkhya," quoting 

Takakusu in BEFEO, 1904, p. 58). 

There is the Saṅkhyasūtra or Saṅkhyapravacanasātra attributed to Kapila (published with two commentaries viz, that of Aniruddha and parts of the Tilā of Vedāntin Mahadeva edited by Garbe in B. I. Series 1881). This is a late work composed about 1400 A. D. as shown by Garbe in his Introduction and by 

2209. Those interested in Saṅkhya may consult the following: Fitz Edward Hall's 'Introduction to Sāókhya-pravacada-bhāsya' (B. I.

Fitz-Edward Hall in his learned Introduction to the edition of the Saṅkhyaprayacana-bhāṣya (B. I Series, 1856). There is an edition of 23 sūtras called Tattvasamāsa with a commentary called Kramadipika in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series whioh has also published several other brief late works that are passed over here. Several commentaries on the Saṅkhyakārikā have been published. The earliest appears to be the one translated into Chinese by Paramirtha about 546 A. D., which has been reconstructed into Sanskrit from the Chinese by the learned Pandit Aiyaswami Sastri and published (in 1944) in the Sri. Venkatesvara Oriental Series with a valuable Introduction; another commentary styled Mātharavștti was published (in 1922) in the Chowkbamba Sanskrit Series. Dr. Belvalkar (in ABORI vol. V. pp. 133-161) contributed a long and scholarly paper on the Matharavstti in which he holds that the Mātharavștti is the original of the commentary translated into Chinese by Paramārtha together with some accretions made from time to time, that Gaudapāda's commentary is a simplified abridgmont of the Matharavștti (p. 148), that the Mātharavștti cannot be placed later than 450 A D. (p. 155) and that Iśvarakļṣṇa cannot be assigned to a date later than 250 A. D. (p. 168). Prof. A. B. Keith in 'Saṅkhya system' (p. 51 ) places Iśvarakrsna at a data not later thao 323 A. D. Another early commentary is the Yuktidspikā of an unnamed author edited from a single ma. by Shri Pulipabehari Chakravarti in Calcutta Sanskrit Series (1938). This is a very valuable commentary and has been very competently edited oven from a single ms, though there are a few gaps here and there. That commentary is replete with quotations and polemical discussions, mentions several Saṅkhya teachers who differed among themselves and whose opinions are cited on many topics. For example, vide under Vindhyavāsin below. It mentions some ācāryas that are hardly over mentioned in any Saṅkhya work. It frequently cites an author called Pañcādhikarana (vide pp. 6, 108, 114, 132, 144, 147, 148 where two Āryās apparently of Pañcādhikarana are quoted). Another hitherto unknown Sāākhyācārya mentioned by this com. is Paurika on p. 169 and p. 175, who holds the surprising view 2010 that there is a separate prailhāna for each Puruṣa. Patanjali is frequently mentioned on pp. 32 (who denied the existence of

Bānkhyācāryds mentioned by Yuklidipika 1365 Ahankara), 108, 132 (there are 12 karanas and not 13 as 8. Kārlka in verse 32 asserts), 145, 149, 175; Vārsagañaḥ (in the plural) are mentioned on pp. 39, 67, 95, 102, 133, 145, 170, Vārṣagapa (pp. 6, 108) and Vārṣagaṇavira ( on pp. 72, 108, 175 ) styled bhagavan on p. 72 and Viṣagapavira (on p. 103 probably meaning the son of Vṛṣagana '); all these refer to the views of Vārṣaganas. Pañoaśikha (p. 31 in the plural, p. 61, p. 175) is mentioned and one passage which is quoted in the Vyisa bhāṣya ( on Y. 8. 1.4) and ascribed to Pancaśikha by Vācaspati is quoted by the Yuktidipikā on p. 41 ds Śāstra. From pp. 113 and 129 it appears that the author of the com, was a Vedāntin, 2011 It is probable that he flourished between 500 and 700 A. D., since he quotes (on p, 39 ) Dinnāga's definition of pratyakṣa' and is not cited by Vaoaspati and other commentators on the Bankhya. 

. Gaudapāda composed a commentary on the 8. Kārikā but only on 69 verbes published in the Ch. S. Series. The Commentary called Saṅkhyatattvakaumudi by the famous writer Vāoaspati miéra was published in the Chowkhamba 8. 8. in 1919. A com mentary called Jayamangala ascribed to Saṅkarācārya (in the colophon) on the 8. Karikā was published at Calcutta in 1933 by Sri H. Sarma with a brief but interesting Introduction by Principal Gopinatha Kaviraj (vide also I. H. Q. Vol. V. pp. 417 431) where Sri H. Sarms tries to prove that the Jayamangalā is earlier than Vācaspatimiśra. Vijñānabhikṣu composed ( about 1550 A. D.) a bbāsya on the Saṅkhyapravācanasūtra. The Sātrakāra and Vijñānabhiksu make efforts to establish the impossible thesis that the teachings of the Saṅkhya system are not in irreconcilable conflict with the doctrine of a personal God or with the Advaita Vedānta. The Mātharavștti on 8. Kārika 71 furnishes the names of certain teachers that flouriabed between Papoagikha and Isverakrepa viz. Bhargava, Ulūka (Kausika ?), Valmiki, Harita, Davala and others, while the Jayamangala mentions Garga and Gautama 88, Saṅkhya teachers after Pangasikha (vide note one in Pandit Asiyaswami's edition on p. 99). The Sanskrit commentary reconstructed from the Chinese version of Paramartha (p. 98 of Pandit Alyaswami's edition)

History of Dharmatastra [ Sea VIII, Ch. XXXI 

states that the line of teachers and pupils from Padoasikha 18 : Pancaśikha-Gārgya-Ulūka-Vārṣagana-Isvarakrsna. It is clear from the above that soveral teachers, in any case pot less than five or six, intervened between Pañoasikha and Isvarakropa. From a somewhat mutilated passage 2212 of the Yuktidipika (p. 175 ) it appears that at least ten persons intervened betweon Pañcaśikha and Isvarakrsna. If this be accepted and if Isvara krsna be assigned to about 250 A.D., then Pancasikha cannot be placed later than the first century B. C. and may be much earlier still. On teda ca bahudba kȚtam tantram' (S. Kārika 70) the Yuktidipikā speaks of bhagavat Pancaśikha as daśama-kumāra' (tonth son of Prajāpati ?) and states that he expounded the gāstra to many persons such as Janaka and Vasiṣtha and thereby identifies Pancasikha with the teacher Pancasikba mentioned by the Santiparva ( vide note 2186 below). 

Vacaspatimiśra in bis commentary on the Yogasūtrabhāsya (II, 23 ) sets out eight alternative viows among Saṅkhya writers on the question of 'darśana' and 'adarśana' and remarks that the fourth out of the eight alternatives is the real doctrine of the Saṅkhyaśāstra.2213 From about the 5th contury A. D. the Sāṅkhyakārikā bas been regarded as the standard work on the Saṅkhya system. The 8. Kārikā itself states that the holy Śāstra was expounded by Kapilamuni to Āsuri, who expoundeda24 it to Pancasikha and the latter expounded the (Saṅkhya ) system to several disciples and that it came down to Isvarakrsna in a succession of teachers and disciples, who summarised it in Arya

Fundamental conceptions of Saṅkhya 

1857 

Verdes. Kapila-muni is here said to be the first promulgator of the Sāṅkhya. 

Before proceeding further the most characteristic and fundamental conceptions of the standard Sāṅkhya must be set out. The most fundamental conception is that there are two entirely distinct esgences existing from eternity, viz. praksti (i. e. nature or matter) also called pradhāna and avyakta, and puruṣa (soul or spirit, the knowing subject). The 2nd fundamental conception is that puruṣas are many. Another most characteri. stio feature of the Saṅkhya system is the doctrine of three 2215 guṇas (factors) called sattva (light, intelligent), rajas (energetic, active, domineering), tamas (coarse, inert, enveloping, dark ). Pradhaps or prakrti or Avyakta is said to be constituted by the three guṇas (triguṇātmaka) when they are in equilibrium (Sattvarajastamasām sāmyāvasthā). The Sārkbya analysed all physical and mental phenomena. The lowest factor is the heavy impenetrable matter and coarse foolish impulses. They are called tamas (desoribed as guru, heavy and varanaka, enveloping). Then there is the factor of constant change in the physical world as well as in the mental. This is called rajag (cala, changing and upastambhaka, exciting, as the 8. Karika puts it). The third factor or element in the world is the varied operation of consciousness that leads to knowledge and experi ence, which is called Sattva (laghu, light as opposed to the coarse, merely material objects and prakāśaka, luminous, as contrasted with tamas). These three factors or elements combine in various proportions and make up the evolving universe. The three are called gupas from several points of view viz, they are qualities, they also bind as with a rope the Puruṣa to samsāra. The basis of the universe is to be found in the guṇas. Pradhana

is not different from the guṇas, but it is only the name of the primordial matter before evolution starts. Praksti being anādi and eternal, the Saṅkhya system did not postulate God 48 creator, and held God to be a superfuity. The Sinkhya propounds a theory of cosmic evolution which is practically as reasonable as any modern theory of evolution. It is probably the earliest attempt to furnish an answer from reason alone to the questions about the origin of the world, about the nature of man and his relation to the physical world and man's future destiny. In the nineteenth century mind and matter were held to be entirely dif. eront and atoms were supposed to be indivisible. Modern physics bas reduced matter to energy but the nature of this last also is a mystery. Under the Saṅkhya systom, puruṣu or prakpli or both serve no religious purpose. There is no definite or convincing answer as to why purusa becomes entangled in the web of praksti, The Saṅkhya simply says that as a result of non-discrimination puruṣa somebow becomes entangled. The Vedāntasūtra rofera to pradhāna as amārta in I. 2. 19 and as anumānika' in I. 4.1. From Prakrti evolves mahūn (i. e, buddhi, consciousness ) from which arises ahankara, from which evolve on the one hand the five tanmātras (subtle elements, viz. sabda, sparsa, gandba, rasa, rūpa) and on the other hand manas (mind) and the ton indriyas (sense organs). From the five subtle elements are evolved the five great elements, earth, water, tejas, vāyu and akasa ( other ). These are twentyfour 2716 tattvas ( categories) and puruṣa is 25th. Pradhāna is distinct from puruṣa and sorves the purpose of puruṣa (who is passive and a sākṣi) who is distinct from the bvolutos of prakrti and is bhoktr (and not kartṛ). The Sāökhya 2017 does not admit God. PrakȚti and puruṣa come together in order that the latter may see its working; just as a blind man and a orip ple (a lame man) may come together (and the blind man may carry the lame man on his shoulder, the latter showing the way and both may reach their destination by this joint effort). 2018 When

puruṣa realizes the difference between himself 2219 and the guṇas constituting Prakrti he is liberated. Both Saṅkhya and Yoga treat the external world as real. They both postulate plurality of souls ( purugas), that are eternal and unchanging. This latter is one of the most crucial differences between Saṅkhya and advaita Vedānta. It is not necessary for our purpose in this chapter to go into greater details. One more doctrine of the Saṅkhya is called satkāryavāda i. e, the theory that the effect already exists in the cause and does not arise from nothing (8. Kārikā, verse 9); compare Chan. Up. VI. 2.2 ( kathamagataḥ sajjāyeta) and Gita I. 16 ( nāsato vidyate bhāvo). 

It is difficult to assign a definite date to the Sāṅkhya kārikā. As Paramārtha treuslated the Karikā as well as com mentary on it into Chinese in about 546 A. D. the Karikā cannot in any case be placed later than about 250-300 A. D. It may be earlier by a few centuries. Umbeka in his common tary on the Slokavārtika of Kumārila mentions an author called Madhava as 'Saṅkhyanāyaka' and Yuan Chwang also refers to & Saṅkhya teacher called Madhava. Dr. Raghavan in 

Sarūpa-Bharati' (pp. 162–164) shows that Mādhava was really & destructive critic of Sāökhya, that the proper reading is *Saṅkhyanāśaka-Madhava' and that he was probably earlier than even Dinnāga and Dharmarkirti (i. e. earlier than 500 A. D.). 

Saṅkarācārya in the passage quoted in n. 2208 remarks that certain Upaniṣad passages may be relied upon as apparently supporting the Saṅkhya system, Some of the Upaniṣad passages that either foreshadow Bankhya dootrines or employ words that have technical meanings in the Saṅkhya system would be

cited, 2220 But one passage from the Atharvaveda X. 8. 43 deserves notice, viz. the knowors of Brabma know that yakṣa endowed with atman which abides in the lotus with nine gates (the physical body ) covered by three guṇas.' With this may be compared Śv. Up. III. 18 and Gita V. 13 ( navadvāre pure debi). The Mundaka Up, states From Him are born prāṇa, mind, all indriyas, the five elements, and sky, wind, jyotis (tejas ), waters and the earth.' The Katha Up. refers to indriyas, the objects of senses, mind, buddhi, mahān, avyakta, puruṣa as & rising series, similar to that of the Sāökbya with one exception viz. the Up. does not mention ahankāra and holds that buddhi and mahān are different, while the official Sāṅkhya identifies them. It is, therefore, clear that the evolution in these two Upanisads is very similar to the theory of evolution stated by the classical Saṅkhya, the only difference being that the Upa niṣads postulate a supreme Creator (that produces the cosmos ) while Sāṅkhya drops the creator and accepts the evolu tionary series only. On V. S. I. 2. 12 Saṅkarācārya citos the verse dva suparṭā sayujā' (which is Mundaka Up. III. 1. 1, Sv. Up. III. 1 and also Rg. 1. 164. 20) and explains it, as referring to the individual self (jiva) and the Highest Spirit (paramātman). The ācārys then mentions the argument of a predecessor who relies upon Paingirakasys brāhmaṇa where the latter half of the verse is explained as mentioning sattva (buddhi) and kṣetrajñu (. e. the individual self). This indicates that some took that verse as putting forward Saṅkhya ideas. The Katha Up. III. 4 states that the description of the individual soul as the enjoyer (bhoktp ) results

The Svetaśvataropaniṣad expressly 3121 refers to Saṅkhya and Yoga (in VI. 13) and says that 'on realizing that cause which can be apprehended by means of the study of Saṅkhya and Yoga he is released from all bonds'. That Upaniṣad is full of words that are frequently employed in the Sāökhya system such as 'avyakta '(1.8), guna (V.7 sa viśvarūpas-trigupaḥ' and VI. 2, 4 and 16), jña (v. 2, VI, 17), prakrti (māyām tu praktim vidyāt' IV. 10), puruṣa (I. 2, III. 12, 13, 1V.7). pradhāna (I. 10, VI. 10 and 16), linga (I 13, VI. 9). The Śv. Up. (VI. 11) describes the one God as 'sākṣi cetā kovalo nirguṇas-ca". The Saṅkhya denies God and transfers these epithets to the Puruṣa, who in his true essence is, according to the Sāṅkhya, merely a passive witness, pure intelligence, unaffected by guṇas. The Praśna Up. (IV. 8) speaks of the five elements and their matras (prthivi ca prtbivimātrā ca &c), the ten indriyas and their objects, manas, buddhi, ahankara &o. The Sāṅkhyas rely on the verde 'ajāmekām'(Śv. Up. IV. 5)2222 for Upaniṣadic support to their theory about praksti and its three guṇas (vide bhāsya of

This verse meta. phorically speaks of Praksti, Parusa and Guñas acc, to the Sāókbya objector, M and ordinarily mean 'she-goat' and 'he-goat'. The words also mean 'unborn'. Therefore, ajā stands for Prakrti and aja for Purusa, both of which are eternal acc, to the Sāṅkbya system. Lohita (red) stands for the guṇa rajas, sukla (white) for sattvaguna (which is prakasaka) and kysna (dark) for tamas. From Praksti are evolved numerous objects. The latter half refers to a soul that is enveloped in ignorance and therefore lives in bondage, but one who has realised the distinction between gunas and puruṣa abandons prakrti i. e. is liberated. The relations of the oumerous purusas (poetically represented as he-goats) to the one Praksti (represented as a aho-goat) are mentioned in this versa. These three colours really stand for three elements viz. tejas, waters and food (i. e. earth). Vide Chān. Up. VI. 3. 1 'vut ofte en THAT IT regis aqui no oui aqui."

Saṅkara on V.8.1. 4.8). That verse means : there is one unborn (female), constituted by red, white and black, but producing manifold progeny resembling each other; there is one unborn 

being (a male ) who resorts to her (loves her) and lies by her; there is another, who loaves her after having experienced enjoyment. Similarly, Saṅkhyas argue that Kapila, the founder of the Saṅkhya system, is mentioned in the Sv. Up. (V.2) 'it is he who, in the beginning, bears (nourishes) by thoughts Kapila sage when born and looks on while he is being born.' If one looks to various passages of the Sy. Up, such as III, 4, IV. 12, VI.18 one must hold that șsi Kapila,2213 the reddish sage, is Hiranyagarbha (the golden child), the first creation (Hiranyagarbhaḥ samavartatāgre, Rg. X. 121,1). Saṅkarācārya (on V. S. II. 1.1) replies that from the mere occurrence of the word 'Kapila' one cannot at once jump to the conclusion that he must be the founder of the Sinkhya, since another Kapila, called Vāsudora, who reduced to ashes the sons of Sagara by his angry look, is well-known.2224 Saṅkarācārya concedes on V. 8. II. 1.3 that both Saṅkhya and Yoga are within the pale of Vedic orthodoxy as regards those portions of them that are not in conflict with the Veda. The five elements (mahābhutani) are mentioned in the Ait. Up. (III.3), Praśna VI. 4 and the five special qualities of these five in Katha Up. (III. 15). 

In view of the fact that the word 'Sāṅkbya' occurs in the Sv. Up, and that the Katha and Muṇdaka have some doctrines similar to the Sāṅkhya system and the Svetāśvatara employs many words that occur frequently in the works on Saṅkhya, the question arises--what is the relation of the Saṅkhya to the Upaniṣads. There are three possible views, (1) that Upe nizad thought and Sāṅkbya made parallel progress, (2) that Sinkhya adopted and expanded some of the germinal ideas

2224. In the Viṣṇupurāṇa IV. 4. 12 Kapila is said to be a part of bhagavān Purusottama, who reduced to ashes the 60 thousand sons of Sagara, that suspected that the Aśvanedba horse grazing near that sage must have been stolen by bim (IV. 4. 16-23). For Vasudeva Kapila, vido V802 parva 107, 31-33, where we read (ia Chitrakālā ed.)'an: FEIT ftat हुनिसत्तमः। वासुदेवेति यं माहः कपिलं मुनिपुङ्गवम्। ... वदाह सुमहातेजा मवाद्धीनस FMI.

of the Upaniṣada, (3) that some Upaniṣads borrowed from the Saṅkhya. It is not possible to discuss these questions here for reasons of space and relevance. The present author holds that it is the Saṅkhya that based itself on the thoughts of the Upanigads, particularly when the older Upaniṣads like the Br. Up. and Chandogya hardly exhibit any traces of Saṅkhya doctrines or technique, when Saṅkhya reference are found only in Katha, Mundaka, Svetāśvatara, Praśna (which are held to be later than Chān. Up. and Bṛ, Up. by modern scholarship) and when there is hardly any work or writer of purely Sāṅkhya doctrines that can be assigned to & period even a few centuries earlier than the Christian era and when no one can place the principal Upaniṣads (about twelve, including the Svetāśvatara) later than 300 B.O., since even the Sv. Up. is referred to as 

Śruti' in V, s. I. 4. 8, II. 3. 22. Garbe (in 'Die Sāökhya Philosophie' pp. 3 ff) denies that Saṅkhya underwent any essen tial modifications in its long history. Jacobi does not agree, holding that Saṅkhya originated out of a common cultural and philosophical heritage and Oldenberg goes the origin of Sāökhya in the Katha and Sv. Up. and holds that epic Saṅkhya is an independent development (Die Lehre der Upanishaden uöd die Anfānge des Buddhismus', 1915, pp. 206 ff). Saṅkhya and Yoga were known to Kautilya (Saṅkhyam Yogo Lokāyatam cetyanyikṣiki' Arthaśāstrā I. 2. p. 6.). Therefore, we may say that Saṅkhya as a philosophical school started at least before the 4th century B. O. 

We should now turn to Sanskrit works other than the Upaniṣads for seeing the origins of the Saṅkhya system. First comes the Mahābhārata. 

In many passages of the Santiparva 1225 references to some of the doctrines, technical words and persons connected with the mature Saṅkhya system occur. The references are so many that the present writer will bave to select only a few passages by way of sample. In chap. 203 there is a dialogue between & clover pupil and his guru. It begins by stating (in verse 8) that Vasudeva is all this (Vāsudevaḥ sarvam-idam), then it proceeds just as from one lamp thousands of lamps can proceed, so prakrti

Then the chap. mentions five organs of knowledge (ear, skin, eye, tongue, sense of smell) and five senges of activity (bands &c) and then there are the five objects of senso (Viz. sabda, sparsa &c) and the mind is all-pervading and the 16th (verses 27-31). Then the chapter speaks of purusa (the soul) that resides in the city with nine 2277 gates and is undecaying, and immorlal, which abines in all beings just as a lamp, whether big or small, doos. In chapter 204 the same dialogue is pursued and the first verse says all bhilas spring from aryakta and are merged (die) in aryakla, it refers to kṣrtra (the body ) and kṣetrajña (in verse 1+) and winds up by saying that, just as seeds burnt by fire do not grow, the soul is not again connected with klesas 2723 when they are burnt by the fire of (correct) knowledge. In chap, 205, verges 22-23 speak of the characteri. stios of the three gunas; chap. 206 says that when a person brings under control anger, avarice, 2229 fear, pride and becomes pure he merges into the highest self that is Viṣṇu in aiyakta form and chap. 207 deals with the measures for reaching the highest goal and puts forward brahinac arya (sexual purity) as

the first measure. . In these chapters, though some dootrines peculiar to the standard Saṅkhya of the Kārikā appear, they are all brought in line with the Vedānta of one supreme Being, which is negatived in the official Sāṅkhya. 

That there were philosophers, who adopted some of the Saṅkhya and Yoga doctrines, postulated Paramośvara ( Supreme Deity) and held that the three, viz. Pradhāna, Puruga and Isvara were different from each other, is expressly stated by Saṅkarā darya 330 in his bhāsya on V. 8. II. 2. 37. Therefore, the Mahā bhārata references to Saṅkhya probably relate to philosophical doctrines in which all three viz. Prakrti, Puruṣas and Supreme Self were recognized, from which arose the later official Saṅkhya that discarded any supreme Ruler of the Universe. In the Nārāyaṇīya section of the Santiparva (quoted in note 1544 p. 954 above ) 'Sārkhya, Yoga, Pāvoarātra, Vedas and Pasupata are said to be knowledges ( jõānāni) and 'pānāmatāni' (different points of view) and Kapila, & paramarṣi, is said to be propounder of Saṅkhya. Chapter 294 (in verses 26-49) deals with the twenty-five tattvas of the Saṅkhya from Prakçti or Avyakta, mahat, ahankāra, the five elements from abankāra (these eight being called prakstis) and then 16 vikāras (Verse 29). These are called kṣetra, the soul is the 25th (v. 35) and is called kṣetrajña and Puruṣa ( v. 37'avyaktake pure śete purusas-ceti kathyate', and Isvara or brahma is not brought in anywhere in that chapter. 

Chapters 211-212 (containing in all 100 versen) of Santi parva deal with what Janaka, called Janadeva, 1231 king of Mithila, learnt from Pancaśikha, when the latter, after wandering over the whole earth, visited Mithilā and who is described as the first (or foremost) pupil of Āsuri and who is said to have performed & sattra for a thousand years on Pañoasrotas 2232

(verse 10). He was the son of a brahmana woman called Kapila and was therefore known as Kapileya (verses 13-15). Janaka had a hundred acāryas in his palace who propounded the diffaront views of different sects. Vorse 9 says that Pañcaśikha made people wonder when he appeared like Kapila, the great sage ( paramarṣi) and Prajāpati, that he oonfounded the hundred ācāryas by his arguments (v. 17). Later Janaka abandoned those ācāryas and followed Pañcaśikha (verse 18). He, after creating disgust in Janaka about his caste or about rites and about everything, expounded to Janaks the highest mokșa which is declared as Saṅkhya. In chấp. 212 Pancaśikba expounds five elements, five jñānendriyas, five karmendriyas, mind (verses 7-22) and the signs (lingas) of sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa bhāvas (verses 25–28) and describes bow a person who seeks the Self is freed from the fetters of pleasure and pain and being beyond the fear of old age and death reaches immortality. In the first place, these two chapters are not sometimes very clear, offer no consistent cloar-cut system and employ words that are difficult to construe and are not completely identical with the scheme of the 25 tattvas of the official Sāṅkhya of the Kārika, since chap. 211 verse 13 speaks of 'ekāksara brabm8 assuming many forms'. For example, it is difficult to say what is meant by 'purusārastham-avyaktam'. The meaning that can be drawn out of the words seems to be 'he (Pancasikha) conveyed knowledge (to Janaka) about Avyakta (i.e. Pradhāna) that depends upon Puruṣa (i. e. that becomes active through union of Puruṣa with it), which is the highest truth. It further says that Pancaśikha became perfect (in knowledge) by the performance of istis and sattras, again by abounding tapas, had a vision of the deity ( God) and he realized the distinction between kṣetra and ksetrajña and also realized brahma symbolized 2233 by om.

fore, the doctrine of Pancaśikha in these chapters of Śāntiparva is really advaita (monism) on which are grafted some doctrines similar to the later official Saṅkhya for explaining creation and so forth.2231 In Santiparva 306. 56-66 ( = Chitra ed, 318. 58-62) Visvāvasu tells Yājñavalkya that he has heard about the 25th tattva (i. e. Purusa) from Jaigiṣavya, Asita-Devala, Vārṣaganya (of Parāśara gotra ), Bhṛgu Pancaśikha, Kapila, Suka, Gotama Arṣṭiṣopa, Garga, Nārada, Āguri, Pulastya Sanatkumāra, Sukra and Kaśyapa (father of Viśvāvasu ) and 336.65 (Chitra. ed. 318. 67 ) states that Yājñavalkya had mastered completely both sānkhya and Yoga. Sāntiparva 304. 4 (=316. 4 of Citra. ed.) states that Saṅkhya and Yoga are one. 2235 

Pancaśikha figures frequently in the Mahabharata. In Sāntiparva, chap. 307 ( containing only 14 verges) Yudhisthira asks Bbiṣma how one can rise superior to old age and death, 

(Continued from last page) but from the passages in the Ahirbadbnya-sambitā, chap. XII. 18–29 it follows that the doctrines of Kapila's Sāṅkbya-tantra were divided into two mandalas called Prākta and Vaiksta aod the two bad 32 and 28 topics respectively. 'ACTRIU Hout Beurer: FUSTET: I gidat TEAT: Met zo मेऽखिलम् । षष्टिभेदं स्मृतं तन्त्रं सांख्य नाम महामुने । प्राकृत कृतं चोते मण्डलेवे समासतः ।।. The com. Arjunamiśra appears to take it as the great doctrine of Kapila came to him (Pancasikba) in the form of an aura of light and expounded to him the bighest trotb' etc. This is extremely far-fetched. There is a doubt about the agent of dyabodhayat and as to whom 'damāsinam' refers. To me it appears that the meaning is that Pancasikba came to him (i, e, to Tapaka) and in parted to bim the great Kapila mandala, the highest truth, the avyakta etc. According to the usual sanskrit construction the agent of "Zgamya' and 'ayabodbayat' must be the same (i. e. Pañcasikba). Foreitā refers to जनक. Compare 'एकाक्षरं परं ब्रह्म। मनु II. 83 and 'ओमित्येकाक्षरं ब्रह्म SYTETET ATHETE' fra VIII. 13. Verse 13 of chap. 211 is surtig aftan प्रतिपेदे ताब्ययम्। (अन्ययं refers to एकाक्षर-ब्रह्म). Therefore, मण्डल should be taken to mean 'the circle of the doctrines first propounded by Kapila."

whether by very great tapas 2236 or by rites or by Vedic learning or by the use of rayāyanas (Blixirs of life or alchemist's prescrip tions ). BhIṣma speaks of an ancient dialogue between Janaka and Bhikṣu Panoaśikha, where the same question was put by Janaka and Pancaśikha replied that none can escape these two and that union with wife and relatives is like meeting persor.s when on a journey (i, e. the company of these is not durable or permanent), nobody has seen heaven or hell, that one's duty is not to violate the ordinances of Vedas, and to make gifts and to offer sacrifices. In this chapter there is hardly anything which approaches the special doctrines of the Sāṅkbya, though Pancaśikha's views are liere set forth. Chap. 308 ( 191 versos out of which less than 30 have anything to do with Pancaśikha's teachings directly) begins with the question of Yudhisthira 'who secured mokṣa without giving up the stage of householder." Then Bhiṣma narrates to him the dialogue between Janaka called Dharmadbvaja 2337 and Sulabhā, a nun. Janaka was learned in the Veda, in mokṣaśāstra and in his own sāstra ( rajadharma), he had controlled his senses and ruled the earth. She heard from ascetics about Jadaka's righteous conduct and she desired to find out the truth. She gave up her form as & pun by her yogic powers and became a woman, a paragon of beauty, and met Japaka. The latter informed ber that he was the pupil of old bhikṣu 2238 Pancaśikha of the Pārāśarya gotra who stayed with him during the four months of the rainy season and who expounded to him the threefold moksa (viz. Sāökhya, Yoga and the science of government) and yet who did not ask him to give up rulership. Janaka said

"I, giving up all attachment, though occupying the highest position ( as ruler), follow the three paths of mokṣa; the highest rule of this mokṣa is 'freedom from attachment, the absence of attachment is due to correct knowledge whereby one is freod from bondage (of samsāra)". Janaka further avows that 2239 on account of the knowledge imparted to him by the bhikṣu who ig. called after his top-knot, he is free from all attachment, though looking after the kingdom and that he is different froma other sannyāsing. Then Janaka gives in verges (308. 38-41) another meaning 2240 of the threefold Mokṣa propounded by Pancaśikha to him viz. (1) highest knowledge and renunciation of actions, (2) strict adherence to the patha of karma ( duties prescribed by Śāstra) and (3) combination of knowledge and actions, and it is said that those who follow this third path resemble householders in soveral respects. Janaka asserts his view.wearing ochre-coloured 2241 garments, shaving the head, carrying a water-Vossel placed on three staves those are merely outward signs and do not lead to mokṣa and that mokṣa does not consist in non-possession of wealth and bondage does not follow possession of some wealth, but it is jñāna by which a porson secures deliverance, whether there is possession or non-possession of wealth'. It appears from verse 40 that Pancasikha emphasized the third kind of Mokṣaniṣtha (Jõānakarmasamuccaya) and Janaka followed that teaching. The rest of the chapter (308) is concerned with Janaka's charges against Sulabhā and Sulabhā's soathing remarks against Janaka.3242 She says at the end you

History of Dharmatāstra (860. VIII, Ch. XXXI 

bayo indeed heard from Pañoaśikha the whole ( doctrine ) about moksa together with the means (for attaining it), with the Upaniṣad passages expounding it or with the auxiliaries (of meditation) and with definite conclusions. 

This passage expressly refers to Upaniṣads in connection with mokṣa and the preceding verses emphasize the freedom from attachment on the part of Janaka (in 308. 37 'mukts sanga'). The Bṭ. Up. in III. 1 refers to the sacrifice performed by Janaka, king of Videha, who set apart a thousand cows to be given to bim from among the brāhmaṇas assembled at it, that would be the most profound in learning and be brahmiṣtha (most learned in or devoted to brahma). Yajāavalkys asked his disciple to take the cows away; thereupon followed a learned disquisition by questions (of angry brāhmaṇas including a woman ) and answers by Yājāavalkya; 2242 the questioners were Aśvala (the holy priest of Janaka ), Jāratkārava Artabhaga, Bhujyu Lābyāyani, Uṣasta Cākrāyapa, Kahola Kāuṣitakeya, Gargi Vācaknari, Uddalaka, Āruṇi, Vidagdha Śakalya (III. 1-9 ending with vijnanam-anandam brahma)'. In Bṛ, Up. IV.% it is said that Janaka Vaideha approached Yājñavalkya, did obeisance to him and said'instruct me' and that then the sage spoke to bim 'you have studied the Veda and the Upaniṣads have been expounded to you by cāryas, but, when you will be leaving this body, where will yo go'? Janaka replied that he did not know it and requested the sage to enlighten him on that point. Then a long disquition follows ( Bļ. Up. IV.2 ff) in which occurs the famous passage ('sa aṣa aeti netyātmā, agshyo na hi gļhyate ...... asango na hi sajjate ....... abhayam vai Janaka prāptosi' (IV. 2. 4). It appears to the present writer that some one desirous of boosting Sāṅkhya teachings inserted the chapters about Sāökbya in which Pancaśikha is substituted in place of Yājñavalkya as the teacher of Janaka. 

It would be seen from the brief synopsis of the chapters 211-12, 307 and 308 that the views described in all of them are not the same as those of the official or standard Saṅkhya, that Pancaśikha's views as presented in chapters 211-212 soom to be different from those in chap. 308, particularly when chap. 308 emphasizes that jõāna-karma-samuccaya was the view of

Pañcaśikha, while the official Saṅkhya holds that jõāna alone leads to liberation. It should be noted that these chapters nowhere refer to a work of Pancasikha but show him to be a wandering ascetic holding certain views. The present writer believes that the author of these pagsages in the Sāntiparva had no work before him and only knew by hearsay and tradition that Pancaśikha was a great Saṅkhya teacher. Prof. Keith holds that the Pancasikha of the Santiparya is not identical with Pancaśikha, the author of Şastitantra (p. 48 of. Saṅkhya System'), 2213 

There are other chapters in the Santiparva where the peculiar Saṅkhya doctrines and terminology are employed but they are brought in line with Vasudeva or Highest Self to which the Saṅkhya doctrines are made subordinate. For example, in chap. 340 Narada is said to have been 2244 told by God himself some of the tenets of Saṅkhya such as the twenty-four tattvas and Puruṣa as the 25th tattva, the three guṇas, that Purusa is kṣetrajña and bhoktr, that ācāryas, who have arrived at definite conclusions about Sāṅkhya, call God who is in the orb of the Sun as Kapila, that Hiraṇyagarbha, who is well praised in the Veda and is announced as (author) of Yogaśāstra, is 'myself'. 

Not only in the Santiparva, but also in other parvans of the Mahābhārata, Sārkbya doctrines are dwelt upon. For example, the Aśvamedhika (in chap. 35. 47-48) speaks of sattva, rajas, tamas as ātmaguñas and mentions their equilibrium. In another place, the same parvan enumerates the 24 tattvas viz. avyakta, mahan, ahankāra &c and describes the three guṇas. 2245

Asuri la mentioned by the S. Kāriki as the pupil of Kapila, also in a quotation in Yogasūtrabhāsya on 1. 25 ( note 2251) and by the Santiparva (chap. 306). But no work is attributed to him and hardly any quotation from him is cited by writers on Sāökbya (except a verse quoted as his by Haribhadra a late Jain writer). Kapila is a legendary figure. In Rgveda X.. 27. 16 Kapila 214 is mentioned as one among ten (Angirases) whom, though similar to them, they ( Angirasos) urge on for a sacrifice, Vide Hall's Preface to Sāṅkhya-pravacanabhāsya ( ed. 1856 ) pp. 14 ff for the confused legends about Kapila. Some references to Kapila in the Mahābhārata have already been noted. In Vanaparva (221. 26) Kapila is styled as the promulgator of Saṅkhya-yoga, as Paramarṣi and as an incarnation of Agni. In the Matsyapurāṇa 2217 it is stated that water should be offered to the seven Bons of Brahmā, viz. Sanaka, Sananda, Sanatana, Kapila, Āsuri, Volhu and Pascaśikba. The Vāmada-purapa (60.70) mentions Kapila (as knower of Saṅkhya), Vodhu, Asuri, Pancasikba ( ag 'yogayukta') and states that Sanat kumāra approached Brahmā for yoga lore. 

In the Snāpagūtra of Kātyāyana (kandikā 3) attached to the Paraskaragphyasūtra the above seven are the only persons to whom tarpunu is offered among zṣis (vide II. of Dh. vol. II.

p. 693). In the Bhagavatapurana (I. 3. 10) Kapila is said to be the 5th avatāra of Viṣṇu, is called siddhesa ( the lord of siddhas) and the teacher of Asuri in Saṅkhya that had become decadent (by lapse of time). The Gitā also (X. 26 siddhānām Kapilo munik') montions Kapila as a muni and the most eminent among siddhas. The 8. Kārikā also refers to him as muni, The Kūrmapurāna (II, 7. 7) echoes the very words of the Gita ('siddhānām Kapilo muniḥ'). 

In the ranéas in Bs. Up. I. 6. 3 and VI. 5. 2-3, in which succession lists of teachers and pupils differing from one another ocour, Asuri is said to be disciple of Bharadvāja in the first and the pupil of Yājñavalkya in the second. Each list contains at least 60 teachers from Brabmā downwards. In the first place, it is difficult to hold that these lists are authentic and there is no evidence to establish that the Asuri mentioned in both is the Bame as the pupil of Kapila. 

Pancaśikha's is a great name in the Saṅkhya system. His systematic work on that system was called Saṣtitantra. The 8. Kārikā (70,72 ) refers to him as the author of the Śastitantra containing great details, illustrative tales and discussions of others' views. It was called Sastitantra because it expounded sixty topics and it contained sixty thousand gathās, 2248 The Yogasūtrabhāsya (IV. 13 ) quotes a verse which is ascribed to Şaṣṭitantra by Vāoaspeti on Yogasūtrabhāsya IV. 13. The present writer cannot agree with Keith p. 69 that the reference to Şaṣṭitantra in S. Kārikā (verso 72) is not to a work but to a philosophy of sixty topics. The āryā 72 had & Sanskrit commen tary which was translated into Chinese in 546 A, D, in which it was stated that the work contained six thousand gathās, 2349 but the Bhamati (by Vācaspati ) on V. S. II. 1.3 ascribes it to Vārsaganya. It may be a slip on the part of Vacaspati or it is possible that he regarded Panouśikha and Vārṣagapy& as the names of the same person, the first being a nickname and the latter a gotra name.

2249, "Gātā' here seems to mean a groap of 32 syllables or a fixed aumber of mātrās as a unit.' The few quotations attributed to Pancadikba are almost all in prose, only one under Y. S. IV, 13 being in verse and later commentators like Bhāva-Gagesa og Saṅkhya-sūtra quote verses of Patcastkha.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXI 

18,20, III. 13 and 41, IV.13 ( tatha ca sastrānusasanam Gupanam &o), prose passages occur which Vacaspati ascribes to Panca sikha. On 8. Kārikā 2 Vācaspati quotes in his com, the view of Pancaśikhācārya. In Yogasūtrabhāsya on I. 25 & būtra is quoted which Vācaspati ascribes to Pancasikha in which Kapila is styled 'adividvan' (the first master of Saṅkhya) and 

paramarṣi' and is said to have imparted to Asuri the Tantra, the Saṅkhya Siddhānta. 

In the dialogue between Viśvārasu Gandharva and Yājāa valkya (in Santiparva, chap. 306) there is a long list of sages from whom Viśvāvasu says he learnt a great deal (in verses 56-60) but prays to Yajñavalkya 2250 that the latter should expound to bim the knowledge of Saṅkhya and Yoga (versos 65-66). Then Yajnavalkya states that prakrti is also called pradhāna, that it does not know the 25th (viz. the puruṣa) and that there is a 26th (Highest Self ) and so on. That list contains the following names: Jaigiṣavya, 2251 Asita, Devala, Vārṣaganya of the Parasaragotra, bhiksu Paricasikha, Kapila, Suka,Gautama, Arstisena, Gargya, Narada, Asuri, Pulastya, Sanatkumara, Sukra, father of Kasyapa. The sages are not mentioned in chronological order. Five of them (that are in Italics) are important so far as Saṅkhya and Yoga are concerned. We saw above that Pancasikha is said to be of Parāśara gotra and in the above list Vārṣaganya also is said to be of the same gotra. Vacaspati on S. Karika 47 ascribes to Varsagapya the view that Qvidyā has five facets or aspects. 2252 The Yogasūtrabhāsya on III. 53 quotes a sūtra of Vārṣagapya. It is shown above from

Panicaśikha and Varsganya :

the reconstruction of the Sanskrit Com. from Chinese that Vārsagana was one of the teachers after Pancabikha and before Isvarakrona. So it is extremely doubtful if Pancaśikha and Vārṣaganya are identical, Vide JRAS for 1905 pp. 33-53 (by Takakusu who shows on p. 47 that Vrṣagana was a teacher of Vindhyavāsa and that Vasubandhu wrote & work called Paramārthaaaptati in opposition to Vindhyayāsa and that Paramartha was in China from 546 to 569 A. D. 

In the Introduction to the Uttarādhyayana-sūtra (a Jain work) Charpentier refers to two different lists one older and shorter which speaks of the four Vedas, Itihāsas (as 5th), Nighantu as the sixth and of the Vedic angas and upāngas and then of Şastitantra. This last may be a reference to Paños dikha's work or simply to the 60 topics dwelt upon in the Saṅkhya system, 

In Santiparva (chap. 222) Yudhisthira asks Bhīṣma: by what character, conduct, lores and by being intent on what does & person reach the abode of Brahmā which is higher (or beyond) prakpli and Bhiṣma mentions the dialogue of Jaigiṣavya and Asita Devala in which it is stated that he who is unperturbed by being reviled or praised, who keeps silent over his good deeds, does not harm oven him who harms him, is always oalm and doos good to all beings, reaches the abode of Brahma. The Buddhacarita (XII, 67) speaks of Jaiglṣavya, Janaka and Vļddha-Parāśara as having secured mokṣa by the path described in that chapter. The Yogabhāṣya (on III, 18) gives a long atory about Āvatya (called prince of Yogins) and JaigIsavya. Jaigiṣavya is quoted in Vyasabhāsya on Y. S. II. 55 for indriya jaya ( control over senses). He appears to be a Vedāntic writer on Yoga 

Not only does the śāntiparya dilate upon some of the peculiar doctrines associated with the later official doctrines of the S. Karikā, but the Bhagavadgita also does 80. A few strik ing passages are cited here. Gitā XII.5 (Mahabhūtānyaha ökāro buddhiravyaktam eva 08 Indriyāṇi dasaikam ca pañoa condriyagocarāḥ") enumerates the twenty-four tattvas omitte ing puruṣa and mentioning the five elements in place of the five tanmātrās); XII. 19-20 ( prakçtim puruṣam caiva viddhya nādi ubhāvapi! vikārāmsca gupārsoaive viddhi prakrti sambhayān \# Karyakāraña-kartstve hetuḥ prakrtir-uoyate ?

(bhômirāposnalo vāyuḥ kham mano buddhireva ca i ahankara itiyam me bhinnā prakstir-aṣtadha :), VII. I3, II. 28. The Gita in VII, 6 and 8 emphatically states that God is the source of the whole world, which ultimately is merged in Him. Herein the Gitā differs materially from the standard Saṅkhya. The Gita expressly mentions “Saṅkhya-krtānta" 2253 (i. e. siddhanta) in XVIII, 13; what that means is that by that time Sāṅkhya toneta had assumed the form of a system but there is no express or definite reference to a work such as in the case of Veda or Vedānta (in XV, 15) or Brahmasūtra (in XIII. 4). 

Vindhyavāsa or Vindhyavāsin ( dweller on Vindhya moun. tain ) is identified with Isvarakļspa by Takakusu in B. E. F. E. O. for 1904 p. 48 and by Keith on pp. 73–79 in Saṅkhya System.' His view about the non-existence of the ūlivāhika body after a man's death is mentioned by Kumārila 2254 Dr. B. Bhattacharya (in J. L H. vol. VI. pp. 36-49) goes into the question of the identity of Vindhyayāga with Isyarakrsna. The prosent writer agrees with him but he does not agree with big Aurther conclusion (p. 49 ) that Vindhyavāda lived earlier than Isvarakroṇa whom he assigns to the period 330-390 A. D. The evidence is too meagre to prove this. In JRAS for 1905 pp. 47 ff. Vindhyavāsa is said by Takakusu to be a pupil of Vrsagaña and that according to Paramartha Vṛṣagana and Vindhyavāsa lived in the 10th century after Buddha's nirvāṇa. From Kamalar ślla (p. 2% of Tattva-sangraha) it appears that Rudrila was also a name of Vindhyavāsa. 

The Abhinavabbārati of Abhinavagupta distinguishes between the two; 2255 so it is pogsible that Vindyavāda only revised the 

2253. Vide p. 954 notc 1545 above where the five Siddhantas (Kftānta. pancaka) are Sāakbya, Yoga, Pancarātra, Saiva and Pāśupata.

Sāökhya system after Iśvarakṣṣṇa. Bhojadeva in his Rāja. 

martanda 2256 on Yogasutra IV. 22(23 of most editions)' drsti drøyoparaktam cittam sarvārtham' quotes a prose passage from Vindhyavāsin. As there is no evidence to show that Iśvarakrspa composed some work other than the Saṅkhyakārikā, Vindhya vāsin must be treated as different from Isvarakļṣṇa according to Bhojadeva. The Yuktidspikā several times mentions the views of Vindhyavāsin and indicates that he is different from the author of the S. Kārikā. Vide pp. 4, 108, 144, 148. This work says that the acarya (author of S. Karika) did not enum erate jijñāsā 2257 and other constituents of the Sāstra but other ācāryas like Vindhyavāsa did mention them in other treatises. On pp. 144-145 this com, shows that Vindhyavāsin held that indriyas were vibhu (all-pervading), denied the existence of a subtle body (suksma sarira), while in S. Karika (40-41) Isvarakļṣpa held that the indriyas were not vibhu and that there was a linga or sūkṣma body and Yuktidipikā p. 144 says that Patañjali postulated & subtle body. 

How the name Sāñkhya came to be applied to a system of philosophy has to be considered. 'Saṅkhya' means 'number', bence enumeration. As the Saṅkhya system enumerated twenty-five tattvas and as the Sastitantra of Pañcaśikha dealt with sixty topics, it is likely that the philosophy came to be called Saṅkhya. The sv. Up. I 4 is full of numbers. 2258 Verse I.5 of Sr. Up. employs the word parāca (five) seven times and also has the word 'paricasadbhedam', similar to satardharam' in I.4); vide VI.3 also. In this sense Saṅkhya means the

philosophic system which postulates twentyfive tattvas, Prakrti, Puruṣa and others. This is the sense in which the word is used once even in the Gitā (18. 13, Sāṅkhya krtante proktāni &o). The Matsyapurāna also emphasizes this aspect of the Bankhya system. 

The word "Saṅkhyā' has another sense as the Amarakosa states (carca sankhyā vicāraṇā ) viz. 'rational examination or 

discernment'; and the word Saṅkhya may be derived from it in the sense of 'system of rational examination' and in the sense of 'philosopher' (masculine) according to 'tadadhite tadveda' (Pāṇ. IV. 2. 59 ) meaning 'Saṅkhyam peda'. :59 The Bhimati explains the word in the second senso. Sāṅkhya in a general sense means tattvajñāna (knowledge of ultimate reality, includ ing Vedānta) or a 'person who knows the ultimate reality. The word Saṅkhya is frequently used in the Bhagavadgita in the sense of tattrajñānu ( as in II. 39, V.5, XIII. 24) and in the sense of a person knowing ultimate reality (in III. 3, V.5). 

Some comparatively early Sanskrit works that disclose tonets similar to the standard Sāṅkhya of the Karikā may be briefly noticed here. The Buddhacarita of Aśvaghosa (in chap. XIII.17ff) mentions a dialogue between Arāda and Gautama (the future Buddha) in which occur prakrii, five elements, ahankūra, buddhi, the indriyas, objects of sense, mind, kṣetrajña as Atman and states that Kapila with his pupil wag enlightened as to these ; that nescience, actions and desires are the causes of samsāra ; that avidyā has five aspects (verses 33–37) which are defined, speaks of brahmacarya, and multi. Though the tattvas are mentioned here the rest of the doctrines bear very little resemblance to the official Saṅkhya. 

The Carakasamhitā 2:60 (Jamnagar ed. 1949), Sārirasthāng chap. I (particularly versos 17, 36, 63-66) contains some doctrines similar to the Sāokhyakārikā scheme and verse 151

refers to Yogins and Sāökhyas and ultimately the liberated soul is said to become brahma. Therefore, it is more like the philo sophy of Katha and øv. Upaniṣads. 

The Susrutasarihita also (in Sarirasthana, chap. I para graphs 3, 4-6, 8-9 ) sets out the Saṅkhya, 2261 is much closef to the standard system of the Karikā than either the Buddha carita or the Carakasamhitā as the quotations in the notes will show. 

From p. 1352 and note 2208 above it would be seen that the tenet of pradhana being the cause of the world was mentioned in their works by Manu and others. This will be briefly illustrated. Manu I. 15 in speaking of creation mentions mabān, the three gunas, objects of sense, five senses. Manular refers to the five tanmātrās of the five elementa. In. Manusmrti XII. 24 sattva, rojas and tamas occur as the three gunas, verses 26-29 define and illustrate these three and XII. 30-38 dilate upon the different effects of the three guṇas and the indications about these guras; XII. 40 provides that those who rest in sattva-guna become gods, those who are rājasa become men and those that abide in tamas become lower animals. 262 Manu XIL 50 speaks of mahan and avyakta. Yaj. smrti (III. 91-92) speaks of the five objects of sense, five jnanendriyas, five karmendriyas and mind (16 inall); these sixteen together with abankāra, buddhi and five elements, kṣetrajña and Isvara are mentioned in Yāj. III, 177-178 and verses 179-180 sot out the evolution of buddhi from avyakta, of ahankāra from buddhi, of tapmātrās from abankāra, the five gunas (sabda, sparsa &c.) of the five elements and verse 182 speaks of the three guṇas.

On p. 1352 and in note 2208 above occurs the statement of Saṅkarācārya that Davala, & Sūtrakāra on Dharma, accepted Sāṅkbya doctrines. This will be briefly indicated here. Apararka on Yaj. III. 109 quotes a very long passage 2263 froml Devala, which after stating that there are two goals of human life (purusārtha) viz. abhyudda', a and niḥśreyasa and that the latter comprises Sāokhya and Yoga, defines Saṅkhya as the knowledge of twenty-five tattvas, and yoga as the fixing of the mind on the desired goal after turning it away from objects of sense, and

On the same page three versos and a hall are quoted from Brabpāṇdapurāṇa for the tbree band has (Brahmaṇḍaparana, Vonk. Edition IV.3.37-40).

states that the fruit of both is apavarga which means the total disappearance of the sufferings of birth and death. The quotation then proceeds to say that there are extensive and profound tantras concerning both Saṅkhya and Yoga composed by former (sages) relying on ratiocination and tradition and these will be summarized and their subjects set out. As to the Saṅkhyas there are these : mūlapraksti, seven categories that are both prakrtis and vikstis, five tapmātrās, sixteen vikāras (products); indriyas are five (jñanedriyas) and five (karmendriyas), five objects of sense, five elements; thirteen karunas, three being aptahkaranas; viparyaya of five kinds, aśakli of 28 kinds ; tuṣti of nine kinds, siddhis of eight kinds; in this way there are 50 pratyayabbodas, there are ton basic matters, viz. astitva (existence of praksti &c). After this there is again an enumera tion of praksti, avyakta, mahān, ahankāra, five tapmātrās &c. 

It would be noticed that the quotation from Dovala in Aparārka contains two parts, the first stopping at the words'iti dasa mūlikārthāļ' and the 2nd containing the rest. It appears that the two parts cover mostly the same ground and it is probable that the two parts are summaries of two different works on Saṅkhya / 

| Another important digest of the first quarter of the 12th century A, D, namely the Kṛtyakalpataru of Lakṣmidhara in its Moksakānda pp. 100-101 also quotes from Davala's Dharmagātra a prose passage which agrees word for word with a portion of the passage quoted above from Aparārka viz. from the words * tatra sankhyānām ekā mūlaprakstiḥ' up to trinyantaḥ karapāni'. Then the portion from 'catasras-catasro' to 'iti daśa mūlikārthāh' is dropped by the Kalpataru and then it has the whole of the passage from 'atha mūlaprakftiravyaktam' up to 'abbimāpa ityanarthāntaram, 2264 after which it adds a short passage not found in Aparārka (which is quoted below). It has the passage 'prakster mahānutpadyate' up to 'ityutpatti kramah' 1 

Both Aparārka and Kṛtyakalpataru (Moksakāṇda) quote verses from Yama on the Saṅkhya system, which are cited in 

2264. After fir RAUTTE occurring in note 2263 the heart reads:सत्तामात्रलक्षणानि तन्मात्राणि स्वानुग्रहलक्षणानीमियाण्यक्षाणीन्द्रियाण्युच्यन्ते।सरल्प

the note below. It will be noticed that after enumerating the twenty-five tattvas Yama adds Purusottama as the 26th tattva.ants 

Purāpas contain lengthy disquisitions on the Saṅkhya doctrines. For example, the Viṣṇupurana I. 2. 19-23, 25-62, VI.4.13.15, 17,32-40 (in all about 66 verses) are full of Saṅkhya doctrines and are all.quoted in the Kștyakalpataru (Mokṣakāṇda pp. 102-108). But that Purana emphasizes that Paramatman (called Vispu) is the support of all tattvas. In Viṣṇupurana I. 2. 22-23 it is asserted 2766 that brahmavadins who are proficient in Vedic doctrines recite (a verse) that expounds pradhana, (and state) 'there was then (before creation) neither day nor night, no sky nor earth, neither darkness nor light, there was only one male brahma that was evolved as pradbāna and that could not be apprehended by the ear (and other indriyas) or by buddhi. Verses 39-40 (of Viṣṇupurana VI. 4) assert that both 2267 praksti and puruṣa become dissolved in the Highest Self who is called Viṣṇu in Vedas and Vedantas ( Upanisads). 

Many other Purāṇas deyote a great deal of space to the elucidation of Saṅkhya doctrines and terminology. Considerar tions of space preclude any statement beyond references to

In the commentary reconstructed from the Chinese translation by Paramartha (edited by Pandit Aiyaswami) occurs the verse पचविंशतितत्वज्ञो यत्र तत्राश्रमे वसेत् । जटी मुण्डी शिखी वापि मुच्यते नात्र संशयः॥" (opp.5 and agalo on p. 55,00 Karika37). This verse occurs ia गौडपाद's भाव्य on कारिका one. भावागणेश (1550-1600 A. D.) in तत्वयाथार्यदीपन (Chow. S.S.) ascribes this last verse to पशशिख.

ohapters and verses of some Purāṇas and the oitation of a fow striking or informative verses. Matsya (3. 14-29) begins with praksti, gunas and all the twenty-five tattvas, remarks that the three gods, Brahma, Viṣṇu, Mahesvara, though one, arose from the guṇas being put into activity and winds up by saying that Saṅkhya is full of enumerations and was proclaimed by Kapila and others.n68 The Brahmapurana (1. 33-35, 33. 3-4,242, 67-70, 76-85) recounts the tattvas from prakrti to ksetrajfia and remarks at the end that the soul becomes kevala (free from 

all contacts and liberated) when he realizes the truth about himself. The Padmapurāṇa in several places dilates upon the tattvas of the Saṅkhya such as in Patalakhanda 85, 11-18, Srstikhanda, chap. 2. 88-103, chap. 15. 177-187, which closely follow the 8. Kārikā verses. The Kūrmapurāṇa (I. 4. 13–35) states that Maheśvara enters prakrti and puruṣa, activates them and sets out Sāṅkhya ideas and in II. 7. 21-26 it refers to the twenty-four tattvas and the state of equilibrium (sāmyavasthā). The Markandeya.purana in chap. 42. 32-62 treats of creation with Saṅkhya terminology. Three verses of the Brahmanda IV. 3. 37-46 referring to the threefold bondage (bandha) are quoted by the Kr̥tyakalpataru (moksa) p. 124. Similarly, Brahmanda (II. 32.71-76) employ the Saṅkhya terminology of mahat,ahaikara &o. Prof. Das Gupta in 'Indian Philosophy' vol. IV. pp. 24-48 deals at some longth with Kapila's philosophy in the Bhāgavatapurāna and Sri Siddhesvara Bhattacharya contributes a paper 'a critique of the Bhagavata' in JBRS for. 1950 pp. 9–50 in which he severely criticizes Prof. Das Gupta.

History of Dharmaśāstra [ Soc. VIII, Ch. XXXI 

Vide Bhagavatapurāṇa IV. 26. The Varābapurāṇa (B. I. ed. of 1893) narrates the story of king Aśvaśiras to whom Kapila and Jaigiṣavya ( the prince of Yogins) came after he had performed the avabhrtha bath and was surrounded by brāhmaṇas and who asked them how the highest Nārāyana was to be worshipped, when the two told him that they were themselves Nārāyana. On his doubting these words of theirs Kapila assumed the form of Vispu and Jaigisavya of Garuda and after other similar wonders, the king requested that his doubt whether Moksa is attained by him who follows karmamārga or jñānamarga be resolved. The same Purāṇa in chap. 25 (verses 1-5) declares that aryakta, the first tattva, made up of three (gunas) arose from the highest Puruṣa, from the union of the two ahankāra was produced also called mahat, that Puruṣa is named Viśṇu or Siva while avyakta is called Umā, Devi or Sri and Guha (Kārtikeya) is abankāra. The Bhagavatapurāṇa (I. 3. 10) mentions Kapila as the fifth avatāra of Visou (vide above p. 1373) and (in X. 8. 37-38) states that when Yaśodā asked the child Krspa to open his mouth she saw inside the inouth the whole world, the five elements, the indriyas, mind, mātrās and the three gupas. Even great poets like Kālidāsa and Bāṇa are fond of utilising Sāṅkhya doctrines and terminology. For example, vide Kumārasambhava II. 4 (Gunatrayavibhāgāya &c.), Raghu vamsa X. 38 (angidām tamagovobhau gunau prathamamadhya mau), Raghuvamsa VIII. 21 (Raghurapyajayad-guna-trayam prakstistham &c.); Kādambari, very first verse (rajojuse janmani...triguṇātmane Damaḥ). 

Even the Tantras were influenced by the Saṅkhya system as the Sāradātilaka shows ( vide above p. 1061), 

It is not a vain boast when the Santiparva 3 269 asserts that whatever knowledge is found in the Vedas, in Sāṅkhya and Yoga, in the various Purāṇas, in the extensive itibāsas, in the arthaśāstra and whatever knowledge exists in the world, all that is derived from the Saṅkhya. For a dispassionate appraisal of the Saṅkhya theory of evolution and its stages, vide Dr. Bebanan's work on. Yoga 'chap. IV. pp. 63-91.
