SECTION VI 

CHAPTER XXVI Tūntrik doctrines and Dharmasastra 

In H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 739 while dealing with the worship of Durgā, who is also worshipped as Sakti (cosmic power or energy ), it was stated that the influence of Sākta worship has boon great throughout India and a promise was given that a brief treatment of Sāktiem would follow in a later volume. It is now time to deal with Śāktas and Tantras, which exercised some influence over the Purāṇas and directly and through the Purāṇas over Indian religious ritual and practices in the medieval ages. 

There is a vast literature on Tantras, published and unpublished. There are Buddhist Tantras, Hindu Trantras and Jaina Tantras. There is a philosophical or spiritual side in some of the Tantras which has not been much studied except by Arthur Avalon, B. Bhattacharya and a few others. In the popular mind Tantras bave been associated with the worship of Sakti ( Goddess Kāli ), with mudrās, mantras, mandalas, the five makaras, the Dakṣiṇamārga and the Vāma-mārga, and magic practices for acquiring supernatural powers. All that can and will be attempted here is to trace briefly the origin of Sāktism and Tantra and point out some of the ways in which tantra has entered into Hindu ritual directly and indireotly through the Purāṇas. 

The Amarakośa states that tantra means ' principal matter or part', 'siddhānta' (i. e, doctrine or śāstra ), a loom or paren phernalia. But it does not state that tantra means a certain peculiar class of works. Therefore, the inference is not altogether unjustifiable that in its time works bearing the peculiar charaoter of what are called Tantras were either not composed or had not at least attained great vogue. In Rg. X. 71. 9 the word ' tantra' ooours and appears to mean a loom. These ignorant 1660 men do not move about lower down ( in this world) nor in a higher

world, being neither (learned) brāhmaṇas nor some-extracting priests; these resort to speech (of a vile kind) and with that vile speech they engage in handling ploughs and looms! The Atharveveda (X. 7. 42) ('tantram-eke yurati virūpe abhya krāmam vayataḥ san-mayūkham') employs the word tantra in the same sense and so does the Tai. Br. II. 5. 5. 3 in a closely similar passage. Pāṇini (V. 2. 70 ) derives the word 'tantraka' (a cloth that is recently taken away from a loom) from tantra'. The Ap. Sr. employs the word 1661 tantra in the sense of 'procedure containing many parts'. The sān. Sr. applies the word tantra to what being once done serves the purpose of many other actions. The Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇini IV. 2.60 and Vārtika sarvasāder dvigośca lah'cites 'garvatantrah' and 'dvitantrah' as examples meaning one who has studied all the tantras' or 'one who has studied two tantras', tantra probably meaning 'siddbānta'. In Yāj. I. 228 (tantram va vaisva.devikam') the word tantra is employed in the sense in which the commentary on the Sān. Sr. takes it. The 15th adhikarapa of Kautilya's Arthaśāstra bears the title "Tantrayukti' (vide J. O, R., Madras, vol. 4, 1930, p. 82 ff) meaning the main canons or propositions or principles of exposition of a śāstra. Caraka (Siddhisthāna, chap. 12. 40-45) also speaks of '36 tantrasya yuktayah' and Susruta ( Uttara tantra, chap. 65 ) names 32 tantrayuktis. In Bphaspati and Katyāyana and in the Bhagavata the word tantra is employed in the sense of doctrine' or 'sāstra'. Sabara in his bhāṣya on Jaimini XI. I. 1 remarks that when and thing or act, once done, becomes useful in several 1662 matters, that is called 'tantra'. Saṅkarācārya in several passages of his bhāṣya on the Vedanta.' sūtras speaks of the Saṅkhya system as sānkhya-tantra and of the Purvammāmgā as 'prathama-tantra '. 1663 In the Kālikā

Meaning of tantra in early works 

1033 

purina (87.130) the works of Usanas and Bphaspati on Rajaniti ( the science of statecraft) are called tantras and in 92.2 the Viṣnudharmottara-purāna is called tantra. In all these cases the peculiar meaning attached to the word tantra in medieval times does not occur. 

It is difficult to determina the exact 1664 time when the word tantra came to bo employed in the sense in which it is used in the 80-called tantra literature nor is it possible to decide what people first introduced tantra principles and practices or where they first arose. M. M. Haraprasad Shastri was inclined to hold that the principles and practices of tantra came to India from out side and he relies mainly on a verse in the Kubjikāmatatantra 1665

LXXIX, for the verse in Kubjikāmata, the ms. of which is written in late Gapta characters (i, em about 7th century A. D.). Dr. B. Bhattacharya appears to hold the same opinion (p: 43 of the work cited in the preceding note). Arthur Avalon in Mahānirvāṇatantra (3rd ed, of 1953 p. 560) holds that tantra was brought into India from Chaldea or Sakadvipa. In 'Modern Review' for 1934 pp. 150–156 Prof. N, N. Choudhari tries to prove that Indian tāntricism bas its origin in the Bon religion of Tibet. He relies on the Tibetan tradition of Asanga baving introduced Tantricism in India. But that tradition is mainly based on Taranath's History of Buddhism. Lama Taranath was born in 1573 A, D. (1575 A, D, according to some) and completed bis history in 1608 i. e. he wrote about twelve hundred years after Asanga. Prof. Choudhuri further relies on the colophon to Ekajatāsādbana (in Sadhana māla No. 127, 314 Taulantay safna). But this sentence is dropped 

in three out of the eight mss. on which the edition is based. Prof. Choudburi further asserts that the guru's position 'in tantra' is neither Vaidika nor Paurāṛika. Here he is wrong. The Vidyāsūkta in Nirakta (II. 4) and the passage of the Svetāśvatara Upanisad quoted in bote 1540 make the Vaidika position of the guru clear. As for the Paorānika position of guru, vide the Lingaparāṇa (quoted in note 1718 below) and Devi bhāgavata (XI. 1. 49.Gurur-brahma' &c. in the same pota) and the Vorse 'यस्य देवे पर भक्तिर्यथा देखे तथा शुरौ तस्यैते कथिता पर्याः प्रकाशन्ते महात्मन: चेताया 34.

which says 'go thou to the country of Bharata for exorotsing dominance on all sides and bring about new creation in varioua ways in pithas, upapithas and kṣetras'. With all respect to that great scholar it has to be said that the passage does not affirm that tantra principles were then unknowe in India and were first introduced in Bbārata after that verse was uttered. That passage could very well have been uttered even when tantra practices had already taken hold of people's minds in India and the reference to pithas aad ksetras ( in the verse ) clearly indi cates that what is meant is only a record of an existing fact, just as the Purāṇas speak in a prophetic vein about what is past. It is possible that a few mystic practices of Rulācāra or Vāmācāra owe their origin to foreign elements or sources. But the one Verse on which M. M. H. P. Shastri relied is far too inadequate for proving this. The Rudrayāmala ( ed. by Jivananda, 1892) contains a panegyric of the Atharvayeda ( 17th patala, verse 4). saying that all gods, all beings (on land, in water and air ), ali sages, Kamavidyā and Mahavidyā dwell in it; verses 10-17 dwell upon the mysterious Kundalini, verses 31 ff dilate upon Yogic practices and six cakras in the body, verses 51-53 mention Kāmarūpa, Jalandhara, Purnagiri, Uddiyāna, and a few otherg 89 Kalika pithas, Bagchi (in Studies in Tantra' pp. 45-55 ) adduces some evidence of foreign elements in the tāntrik doctrines. The Rudrayāmala 166 (17th Patala, verges 119-125 ) states that Mabāvidyā appeared to sage Vasiṣtha and asked him to go to Cinadeśa and Buddha, who is said to have taught Vasistha the K'aula path, Yoga practices for the attainment of siddhis ( extraordinary powers) and directed him to make use of five makāras ( madya &c.) in his sūdhanā for becoming a perfect Yogin. All this shows that pithas flourished in India when the Rudrayāmāla was composed, that Tantrik practices had grown in China or Tibet and that Buddha was deemed to have taught those practices, which is a libel and a vile travesty of Buddha's noble teaching.

Mystic words and magic spelfs in Veda 1035 

Magio spells are found in plenty in the Atharvayeda and some mystic words or syllables are used even in the Rgveda; e. g. the word 'yaṣat, ooours in Rg. VII. 99. 7, VII, 100.7 and other verses and the word svāha 1687 OCCUTS Over a dozen times in the Rgveda (e. g. in I. 13. 12, V. 5, 11, VII. 2. 11). A sleep inducing spell occurs in Rg. VII. 55. 5–8, 1668 which verses occur also in the Atharvaveda IV.5.6,5, 1, 3 and which spell waa probably employed by a purohita to put to sleep some noble man complaining of sleepless11888 at night. Some Western scholars have held that this hymn is a lover's charm for & clandestine meeting with his lady-love. But the whole hymn ban hardly any words of love in it and the author is not able to accept that theory as proved. Rgveda X 145 is a hymn to be employed against a co-wife, the first verse of which is 'I dig up this herb, which is a most powerful crespor, by which (a woman) injures her co-wife and by which she secures her husband ( to herself alone )'. 

The Rgveda frequently mentions magicians who appear to have been mostly non-Aryans described as adeva (godless anstadeva ( worshipping false gods ), siśnadeva (lecherous, Rs. VIL. 21. 5, X. 99. 3). For reasons of space, it is not possible to go into great details. Tāntrik works describe the six cruel. acts which will be dealt with later on. In the Vedic times it was supposed that some wicked people could by charms and incantan tions bring about the death of men and animals or make thema ill. Two long hymns (VI. 104 and X. 87 both containing 25 Verses) are enough to show how the Rgyeda people were afraid of black magic. Both hymns are full of the words ' Yātudhāna" (one who employs black magic) and 'rakṣas.' (devil or evil spirit), the word yātu being the same as "jadu' (employed in Marathi and other regional Indian languages). There were female evil spirits also oalled 'pisaoi' (Rg. I. 133, 5 O Indra 1 destroy the reddish very powerful pisāoi and kill all evil spirits )'. A few verses from the Rgveda may be tradslated 

1667. In the Tantras the word "svābā' in mantras is indicated by bach a word as' wife of Agni'. Vide Tantrik Texts, vol. 7, -whatever to called caret, et aad is, also interface VI. 62-63,

VII. 104. 15-16); O Maruts / may you spread in different places among the people, and wish to seize the devils and pound to dust the devils (raksasah) who Assuming the form of birds fly about at night and who, when the sacrifice is shining, produce deadly obstacles ( ibid. verse 18 );.

X. 87. 5 and 14). 

• In the Ap. Gr. (III, 9. 5-8) it is said that the plant used by the co-wife is called Pathā and the hymn (Rg. X. 145 ) is employed for securing domination over the husband and for harming a co-wife. Rg. I. 191 is a charm against various poisons. In the Atharvaveda there are numerous hymds styled * satrunāśana' (destructive of enemies) e. g. II. 12–24, III, 6, IV. 3 and 40, V. 8, VI. 6, 65-67 and 134. Atharva II. 11 is styled 'Kṛtyā-dūṣana' (counteracting black magic). A fow of the typical verses may be cited 1669 here. *Employ magio spells against him, who hates us and whom we hate; attain (i. e. dominate) him who is superior and surpass him who is (our) equal';'O Soma I strike in the mouth with your thunder bolt him who speaks evil of us that speak what is good and may he, being crushed, run away'. The Sukranitisārs (ed. by G. Oppert, 1882 ) provides that the Tantras are the Upaveda of the

Some spells from the Atharvaveda

Atharvavada. Atharva IIL 25 and VL 130 are spells respectively employed by a man and a woman to soften the heart of the person loved; Atharva II. 30 and 31 are charms for driving away or destroying worms that cause diseases and V. 36 is a charm against pisācas (goblins ). 187 The sound 'phat' occurs in Vāj. S. In the Ap. Sr. Sātra phat is employed in offering Soma stalks in abhi cūra ( employment of spells for a malevolent purpose ). Phat is a sound frequently employed in the worship of Devi in Tantra works. But no direct connection or line of evolution from the Atharvaveda to the Tantras can be traced, The Tattvasangraha of śāntarakṣita (705–762 A. D.) connects even Buddha with magio practices. It says 'all wise mon declare that it is dharma from which results worldly prosperity and the highest beatitude. Seen results such as intelligence, health, rulership are produced by properly observing the rules about mantras, yoga and the like declared by him (i, e. 1671 by Buddha)'. But one cannot place implicit reliance on any writer's statement made more than a thousand yean after the event or person referred to in it. There are, however, stories in the Pali sacred books about the cultivation of magic powers among Buddha's own disciples, o. g. the story of Bharadvāja 1672 who rose in the air for & bowl carved out of very fragrant

sandalwood. Further, there is a story of miraculous powers possessed by all the members of the family of a layman called Mendaka (viz, himself, his wife, son and daughter-in-law ) in Mahāvagga VI. 34. 1 ff. (8. B. E. vol. XVI. pp. 121 ff). Honey again we have to remember that there is nothing in the Tipitaka or any early Buddhist document to prove that Buddha or his first disciples had anything to do with mudrūs, mantras and mandalas and that neither Yuan Chwang nor I-tsing refers to any Tantras, though both of them refer to the Buddhist mona stories as centres of Buddhist culture (vide Dr. De in N. I. a. vol. I. pp. 1 ff). In the introduction to Sadhanamālā (vol. II, LXVIII.) Dr. Bhattacharya relies upon the words Sugatom padistam' and 'Sugataiḥ' occurring on pp. 334-335 of 'the Sadhanamālā for holding that Buddha himself must have pro mulgated some mantras. There are two weighty objections this *Sugataiḥ' does not always mean Buddha, but means also 'followers of Buddha' and secondly, just as most Hindu Tantras are dialogues between Siva and Parvati, 80 later Buddhist writers might have easily said that they aro quoting the Buddha; the same objection applies to Kamalaśila's romarks quoted by Dr. Bhattacharya, 43 Kamalasila and his teacher tourisbed about 1200 years after Buddha. 

The question whether Buddhist Tantras were prior to Hindu Tantras or vice versa is difficult to decide. It appears probable that both arose nearly about the same time. Vide The Sāktas' by E. A. Payne pp. 72–74 for discussion of views. In the Sādbanamālā (a Vajrayana work consisting of 312 small works composed according to Dr. Bhattacharya from the 3rd century A, D. to 12th century A. D.) four pithas (chief centres) of Vajrayāna 1673 are mentioned viz. Kāmākhyā, Sirihatta (or Srthatta ), Pūrnagiri and Uddiyana. The first two are reaper 

1673. It appears that in some Tantra works five Pithas ara araad (according to A P. Sastri's Cat, of Nepal Palm-leaf and selected papar mss. in the Nepal Durbar Library. Calcotta, 1905, p. LXXX) viz. Odiyada (lu Orissa, says H. P. Sastri). Jāla (in Jalaodar). Pūrṇa Mataāga lo Srilaisi and Kāmākbyā in Assam. The very fact tbat five pitbas are named ia tbo work supposed to be delivered by Siva shows beyond doubt that before the work Tantrism had spread in all parts of India. The Sadbanamālā (vol II pp. 453 aod 455) meations Uddiyana, Purnagiri, Kāmākhyā and Strihagga ; the Kulacūļāmagitantra (Tantrik texts, Vol. IV) in 6tb patala versos 3-7) refers to five piṭbas viz, Uddiyāna, Kanarūpe, Kāmākhyā, Jalandhara and 

(Continued on natt page)Pithas of Vajrayana

tively identified with Kamakhya or Kamarūpa ( three miles from Gauhati) and modern Sylhet. The exact situation of the other two is a controversial matter. M. M. E. P. Shastri identified Uddiyāna (which is most frequently mentioned as a pitha ) with Orissa. His son Dr. B. Bhattacharya thinks it most probable that Vajrayāna Tāntrioism arose in Uddiyāna (p. 46 of Intro. to B. E.). Dr. Bagchi in Studies in the Tantras' pp. 37-40 furnishes good grounds for holding that Uddiyāna was near Swat valloy in N. W. India and Grousset 'In the footsteps of Buddha' pp. 109-110 holds the same view. The Bārbaspatya Sūtra (ed. by F. W. Thomas) names eight sāktaksetras (III. 123–124). In his Intro. to Bādhanamala (vol. II. p. LXXVIII) Dr. Bhattacharya holds that the Hindu tantras were introduced on the model of the Buddhist tantrag. But Winternitz (in 

History of Indian Literature', Eng. tr., vol. II. p. 401) states that this view of Dr. Bhattacharya is contrary to the facts and the present writer agrees with this view. 

Though Dr. Bhattacharya admits that Buddhism and Jainism exploited Hindu gods in the earlier period, he asserts (on p. 147 of his Intro. to B. E.) that it is possible to declare without fear of contradiction that the Buddhists were the first to introduce the Tantras in their religion and that the Hindus borrowed them from the Buddhists in later times'. It is no honour to ancient Hindus to be called the pioneers in the practice of black magio. But scholars have to seek truth irrespective of the question of honour or dishonour. Very weighty arguments are advanced by Valleé Poussin (in E. R. E. vol. XII, p. 193), Winternitz and Payne (on sāktas p. 73 ) for the opposite view and the present author agroos with them. Hundreds of works were translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan and Chinese. The traffio of borrowing has been all one way from India to Tibet and China. Vide a paper on 'China's debt to India' by Prof. Liang Chi Chao in Viśvabhārati Quarterly, vol. II, for 1924-25 pp. 251–261, where it is stated that 24 Hindu scholars from A. D. 67 to 789 came to China, besides 13 from Kashmir and that the Chinese scholars that went to India for study from 265-790 A. D, numbered 187 of which the names of 105 can be ascertained.

History of Dharmalāstra (Soc. VI, 06. XXVI 

There is hardly any evidence of the translations of Chinese or Tibetan works into Sanskrit. Besides, the three great Chinese travellers never refer to the study of Buddhist Tantras in India. Watters On Yuan Chwang's Travels in India ' vol. I. p. 360 narratos a story from the pilgrim's life that when he left Ayodhyā in a boat and proceeded east down the Ganges, thugs that looted the boat decided to sacrifice him to Durgā but that the Chinese pilgrim was saved by a hurricane which put the thugs in terror, who released him and treated him with Teveronce. Vide also 'In the Footsteps of Buddha' by René Grousset pp. 133-135 for this incident. We see that there is evidence of the prevalence of Tantrik and Sākta worship in India long before the 7th century A. D. There is hardly any evidence of any Buddhist Tantrik work before 650 A, D. except perbaps the Guhyasamajatantra and Manjusrimūlakalpa, both of which contain late elements. In this way, presumption and chronology are both against borrowing by Hinduism from Buddhist Tibetan or Chinese Tantrik works. Vide Tibet past and present' by Sir Charles Bell (1924) pp. 23, 25, 29, Sardar K. M. Panikkar's work 'India and China' (1957) p. 70, 'Intro duction of the alphabet in Tibet' by M.M. Dr. Satischandra who holds that it was borrowed from Magadha in 7th Century A. D., that show that a written script based on an Indian alphabet as prevalent in Kashmir was first introduced about 640 A. D., that the Tantrik Buddhist Padmasambhava was summoned from Uddiyāna by a Tibetan king Ti-son Do-tson (749-786 A. D.) on the recommendation of Santarakṣita Bodhisattva and was induced to settle in Tibet. Bunjiu Nanjio's Catalogue of Tripitaka' (Oxford, 1883), appendix II. p. 445 No. 155 shows that Amoghavajra translated many works between 746 and 771 A. D., died in 774 A. D. and that it was under his influence that Tantra doctrines gained currency in China. It is clear from the works of Bāṇa as detailed later on that worship of Candikā with wide and flesh was prevalent in India long before 600 A. D., that Śriparvata was famed for its tāntrik siddhis, that sivasamhitas existed, that japa of mantras a crore of times in a cemetery was gupposed to confer siddhis, that he 14th of the dark half of a month was deemed the proper tithi for japa and black magic. Therefore, it is most likely that Sākta or Tāntrik dootrines were taken to China and Tibet from India and not vice versa. Prof. P. V. Bapat in '2500 years of Buddhism' (pp. 360-376) follows (at p. 363) Dr. B. Bhattacharya and tries to prove that Tibetan Tāntrism is earlier than Hindu Tantrism, but his argumento

like those of Dr. Bhattacharya do not oarry conviction at all, Dr. A. S. Altekar in his paper on Sanskrit Literature in Tibet ( ABORI, Vol. 35 pp. 54-66) shows how Buddhism entered into Tibet in the reign of Strong-Tsan-Gampo (637-693 A, D.), that about 750 A. D. :Padmasambhava from Orissa and Vairocana from Kashmir were pioneers and how about 4500 works were translated into Tibetan. 

Even Dr. Bhattacharya admits that Buddhist Tantras in outward appearance resemble in a marked degree Hindu Tantras (p. 47 of Intro. to B. E.), but he contends that in the subject inatter, the philosophical doctrines and religious principles there is little similarity. As Buddhism did not believe in Hindu gods they do not speak about Sakti or Sāktism. But just as in Hindu Tantras there is the male principle Siva and the female principle of Devi, the Buddhists postulate Prajñā (which is feminine) and Upāya (masculine) as two principles and invest them with the same roles as those of Siya and Davi but reyorsed in character. They had to graft on the idea of Sunyata the ideas underlying the concepts of Siya and Devi or Sakti. The subject matter is very similar as regards the goal and means (Yoga &o) and the procedure of mantra, guru, mandala &c. is the same. The most important and early works of Buddhist Tāntric cult, the Prajñopāya-viniscayasiddhi and Jõānasiddhi are not earlier than the 8th century A. D., when Sāktism and Tantrismo had both boon long established in India. 

The word 'Sākta ' means one who is a worshipper or devotee of Sakti' (cosmic power or energy). It appears that long before the 8th century A. D. this cult had spread in almost all parts of India, particularly in Bengal and Assam. Sakti under different names (such as Tripurā, Lohita, Sdaśikā, Kāmeśvari) was conceived to be the primordial principle of all activity in the universe and is generally worshipped under the name of Devi. The Devīmābātmya is one of the chief works of the Saktas and has been described above on pp. 155-156. The chief characteristics of the sākta cult are the doctrinc that God or Deity is one and is to be conceived as the mother and also the destroyor 1674 and that there is a special form of ceremonial 

1674. One of the dhyānas of Devi as Kali is as follows: I HERI घोरदंडीसम्मुनीम् । चर्सो समुण्ड-बरामयका शिवाम् । मुण्डमालाधरी देवी उलविहां दिमन्वयम् । एवं सञ्चिन्तयेकालीं श्मशानालयवासिनीम् । कालीमन्त्र in झारमोद

worship which sometimes assumed debased and revolting forms. Dari has been eulogised in other Purāṇas also as in Vamana (18-19), Doyl-bhagavata (III. 27), Brahmānda (that oontains the Lalitāmāhātmaya in 44 chapters), Matsya (13. 24-54, where 108 names of Devi and 108 places of her worship are set out), Kūrma (I. 12). In the last Purāṇa (Kūrma I. 12 ) Devi is called Mahamahiṣamardini (98), Anahata, Kundalini (128), Durgā, Katyayani, Candi, Bhadrakali (143 and 148 ) and it is stated that the śāstras opposed t675 to the Veda and Smrti that are popular among people such as Kāpāla, Bhairava, Yamala, Vāma, Arbata were propagated by Devi for deluding the world and were based on ignorance. Vide also Brahmapurāṇa (181.48-52) for names of Devi and for the proposition that Devi when worshipped with offerings of wine, flesh and other edibles becomes pleased and grants men's desires. Bhadrakāli is com. paratively an ancient name. In the Sāó. Gr.(SBE vol. XXIX p. 86 ) it is provided that an offering is to be made to Sri at the head of the bed on which the householder sleeps and at the foot of the bed to Bhadra-kāli, while Manu provides that, in the daily baliharana, bali (offering ) is to be offered to Bhadrakali in the south-west. 

The Tantras and Sākta works have much in common, the main point of difference being that in the Sākta cult Devi (or Śakti) is worshipped as the highest, while Tantras (which include also Buddhist and Jaina works) are not restricted to the worship of Devi or Sakti, but may be agnostic, Vedāntic or 

Sāṅkhya in their philosophical outlook. Dr. B. Bhattacharya 

• (in Intro. to Gubyasamājatantra p. XXXIV and in Intro, to 

Sadhananālā vol. II, p. XIX) states that, for a work to be called a real Tantra, there must be the element of Sakti in it. But this is plainly rather an over-statement. The Vāyupurāṇa enumo. rates the Sākta among six darśanas ( philosophio points of view) as in note 16750 

Even the Rgveda speaks of the Saktis of the great gods of the Vedic pantheon. But the Sakti or Saktis are of the God

The word Śakti' occurs in the Rgveda about a dozen times in the singular as well as in the plural, five times with Indra, 1676 once with Aśvins (Rg. II. 39.7), twice with pitps (I 109.3, VI. 75.9) and once with gods in general (X. 88. 10, who are said to have created Agni with their powers). Sometimes, the word ' Māyā' is used with regard to Indra instead of the word Śakti. ' Indra! I long for your great friendship and powers (saktih )...understand that you are our great protector; I proclaim your ancient and recent deeds, O Indra endowed with powers (Saktivah)!......; ' Indra assuming 1677 many forms by his powers (māyābhiḥ) repairs (to many saorifices), ton hundred horses are yoked to his chariot'. In these passages there is no question of worship ping sakti or faktis of the god praised. The more frequent word, however, is 'Saci' ('sacibhiḥ' occurring 36 times and 'sacyā' 12 times). The word 'Sacipati' (lord of Saci or power) occurs sixteen times in the Rgveda and has been applied in all places to Indra, except once in Rg. VII, 67.5 (where it is applied to Asvins). It cannot be said that in the Rgveda Saci' is the wife of Indra (as it is said in later mythology). since the plural is more frequent than Saoi in the singular and since Aśving also are called 'sacipati'. once. Similarly, the word 'Sacīvaḥ occurs eleven times, in nine of which it is addressed to Indra but it is once applied to Agni (Rg. III. 21. 4) and once to Soma (Rg. IX. 87.9). The ideas associated with the words. Sakti' and Saci' are those of creation, protection, valour, and bounty. In Rg. I 56. 4 Indra's power is called 'Devi tayiṣi' but the word Saci does not occur in that verse. There is a sublime hymn (Rg. X. 125 ) of the power of Vāk ( speech), wherein Vak is said to associate with Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, all gods and is

Vak is said to stretch the bow for Rudra in order that the destructive enerny of brahma (prayer or God Brahmā) may be killed, that Vāk stands occupy. ing all worlds and that her body touches leavon, that it is beyond heaven and the earth, that Vāk stands so vast by its greatness'. Vāk becomes the principle of all energy. Acoording to the Nighanṭu (I. 11), menā, gnāḥ and saci are three of the 57 words meaning Vāk. In Tai. S. V. 1.7.2 the metres are called .gnās'. Rg. I. 164, 41 is an enigmatio description of Vak explained in Nirukta XI. 40. It should be noticed that, just as Dovi or Sakti is associated with Siva in later literature, so are Indrāni, Varuṇānī, Agnāyi, Rodasi associated with Indra, Varupa, Agai and Maruts respectively as wives. 'I invoke Indrāṇi, 1673 Varupāni and Agnāyi for my welfare and for drink iog Soma'; 'May the women, the wives of gods, partake of the offering, viz, Indrāṇi, Agnayi, the brilliant ( wife) of the Asyins, Rodasi; may Varuṇāṇi listen (to our laud); may the goddesses partake (of offerings) at the time (appropriate) for women'. It must be said, however, that these goddesses ( deviḥ ) play a very subordinate part in the Rgveda. No direct connection can be traced between these Vedic goddesses and the later concep tion of Devi or Sakti. Indrāni is invoked for protection in Rg. I 22. 12, II. 32. 8, V. 46. 8, X. 86. 11-12. In Rg. V. 46. 8 Indrāni and three others are called Devapatnīs and 'gnās'. In Rg. I. 61. 8 it is said that the gnās, the wives of gods, wovo, when Indra struck the demon Abi, a song of worship. The word 'gnā' occurs 20 times in the Rg. in the nominative, objective, instru mental and locative and is an Indo-European word for wife (Greek has it). Vide Nir III, 21 whera 'menā' and 'gna' occur. In the Kenopaniṣad Umā Haimavati ( daughter of Himavat) tells of Brahma to the gods Agni, Vayu and Indra (III. 12). In the Svetāśvataropaniṣad it is said 'they (brahma Yādins ) endowed with meditation and Yoga saw Śakti (power) abiding as non-different from God and concealed ( from com

prehension) by its own attributes (or by sattva, rajas and tamas).' The same Upanisad (in VI. 8) speaks of Brahma as possessing the highest Sakti 1679 in various forms and this text is quoted by Saṅkarācārya on Vedāntasūtra II. 1. 24. In the bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra II. 1. 30 and in the sūtra itself Brahma is said to be endowed with all powers. Vide also Svetasva. IV. 1. The Nārāyanopaniṣad contains an invocation of Durgā-devi 1680 'I approach as a refuge the blazing goddess Durgā, brilliant like fire, luminous owing to tapas, that is resorted to for (yielding) the rewards of religious actions; O goddess possessed of excellent 

mighti adoration to your power'. Raghavabhatta 1681 avera that Tantra cult is based on Sruti as can be seen from the Upaniṣads called Rāmapūrvottara- tāpaniya and Nṭsimbapūr vottara-tāpaniya. Similarly, Bhāskararāya in his commentary Setubandha on Vāmakeśvaratantra mentions several Upa niṣads as treating in detail of the bhakti of Mahātripura-sundari and interprets Rg. V. 47.4'catvari im' as referring to Kadividya, But all these Upaniṣads seem to be purposely composed to bolster up the tantras that had come to be looked down upon and they ____1679. ते ध्यानयोगानुगता अपश्यन्देवारमशक्ति स्वगुणैनिंगदाम् । श्वेताच. 1. 33; परास्य शक्तिविविधैव श्रूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानवलक्रिया च॥ श्वेताश्व.

are mostly mentioned by late medievel writers like Raghaven bhatta and Bhaskararārya. There are two great hymns addressed to Durgā in the Mahābhārata, 1682 viz. in Virātaparya (chap. 6) by Yudhisthira and the other in Bhiṣmaparya (chap. 23) by Arjuna, but they are discarded as apocryphal in the Poona oritical edition. The Gangadhara stone Inscription of Viśvavarman of 480 of the Mālava era (424 A.D.) refers to Mātra (Mother Goddesses ) and Tantra. 1683 The Br, S. 57. 56 mentions the groups of Mātpe. The Výddha-Hārita-smrti rocommonds that the householder should not enter places of Saira, Bauddha, Skānda and Sākta 1684 cults. The Visṇupurāṇa 1685 (one of the earliest among extant Puriṇas) speaks of the whole world as that of Viṣnu, who is the highest Brahma and is endowed with 

1682. In JRAS for 1906 pp. 355-362 B, C, Majumdar endeavours to show tbat the two hymns to Dorgā are late interpolations in the Mahā. bbārata, probably derived from practices of god-Aryan Sūdras in Oriya speaking bill tribes of Sambalpar. But he forgets that apart from other sources Kalidasa (not later than about 400 A, D.) speaks of Parvati as Umā, Aparnā, Dargā, Gauri, Bbavāni and Candi in his several works and also that Kālidāsa refers to the Ardbanārīśvara form of Siva. In the last verse of the Sakuntala Kalidāsa speaks of Siva as 'parigata-faktih' and thereby suggests that at least tbe germs of the later Sakti worsbip were not unknown in his times. Therefore, the worsbip of Durgā in her several aspects is older than 300 A. D. by at least a century or more; vide pp. 185-186 above.

Sakti, enumerates some of the names of Durgā as Ārya, Vedagarbhā, Ambikā, Bhadrā, Bhadra-kāli, Ksomadā, Bhāgyadā and winds up by stating that when Durgā is worshipped with offerings of wine, flesh, various kinds of foods, she, being pleased, would fulfil all desires of men. In the Kādambari of Bāṇabhatta there is a long description of the temple of Candikā at a few days' journey from Ujjayini, where there was an old Dravida devotee, in which the following points deserve to be noted, viz. offerings of the heads of animals, lion as vāhana, the slaughter of Mahiṣāsura, the doctrines of Pāśupatas written down on small books of palm leaves containing jugglery, tantra and mantras, Durgā-stotra written on a piece of cloth, ruined temples of the Mātrs and description of the Dravida devotee as knowing thousands of wonderful stories about Sriparvata. Bāpa describes at length what queen Vilāsavati, pining for a son, began doing to placate all Gods viz. sleeping in the shrines of Candikā where guggulu was being incessantly burnt, taking auspicious baths on nights of dark 14th in public squares where magic circles had been drawn by great magicians, visiting temples of Mātra, wearing amulets inside which were pieces of birch leaves on which mantras had been written with yellow pigment, and, when delivery was dear, her bed was rendered holy with various herbs, roots and yantrag (figures or diagrams). In the Harsacarita (III) there is a reference to magic circles and to human sacrifices in the description of the Saiya ascetic Bhairavā cārya who had all the Saiva-samhitas by heart, who performed the japa of a mahāmantra called Mahākālahṭdaya & crore of times in a cemetery and wanted the help of Puṣpabhāti (an ancostor of Emperor Harsa ) for perfection in that mantra to be achieved by subduing a vetala and who ultimately attained to the position of Vidyadhara and rose into the starry firmament. In the last Introductory verge of the Harṣacarita the Emperor Harga is, by means of puns, called the Sriparvata in yielding all Siddhis ( supernatural powers, or fulfilment) according to the wishes of all supplianta. 1686 Those descriptions from the works of Bāṇa (first half of 7th century) show bow even long before the 7th century A. D. the worship of Candi, with flesh and the Sakta or Tantrik paraphernalia of mantras, siddhis, mandalas and yantras had gripped the minds of all Indian people, great

and small, rich and poor. In the Mālatimadhava (Aot V) we have a gruesome picture of human sacrifice to Camunda. In the same drama Saudamini is described as observing the vows of a Kāpālika on Śriparvata and as having secured supernatural powers by means of mantras. Sriparvata is mentioned as a holy place of Siva and Dovi in Vanaparva 85. 19.-20. The Vāsavam datta of Subandhu (p. 87 of Hall's ed.) speaks of Sriparvata as Sannihita-mallikārjunaḥ.' Later on a few passages from Sanskrit and Prakrit literature will be cited to show how the teaching of Tantrik practices led to grost moral debasement and revolting orgies in the name of religion, 

The literature on Tantras was vast (vide ‘Principles of Tantra' ed. by A. Avalon, part 1 pp. 390-392 for a long list of Tantras). Both Hindu and Buddhist writers composed numerous works on Tantra and a very large number of subjects came to be included in Tantra works. Buddhist and Hindu Tantras are alike in some respects but they differ in the topics discussed, philosophical doctrines and some religious principles and practices. Tāntra works were introduced into Tibet, Mongolia, China, Japan and South East Asia Originals of many of the Sanskrit Tantrik works are now not available, but the trang lations of some of them in Tibetan are available. 1687 It is aid that even now if proper search is made, three hundred works on Tantra may be discovered (vide Dr. B. Bhattacharya in vol. X. of ŚrI Rāmavarma Institute of Research at Cochin p. 81 ). 

It is difficult to give a general definition of Tantras. The word Tantra' is derived usually from 'Tan' to spread and 'trai' (to saye). 'It spreads (dilates upon) Dacy matters including the tattvas and mantras and affords protection; 

1687. The following works will convey some idea of Sakta doctrines and practices: R. G. Bhandarkars's 'Vaignavism, Saivism &c.' (in Collected Works, Vol. IV pp. 203-210); "Sakti and Sakta' by Sir Jobo Woodroffo (1920); 'Serpent Power' by Arthur Avalon (Sir Jobo Woodroffe); "the Sāktas' by E. A, Payne (Oxford University Press, 1933) Sakti or divine power' by Dr. Sudhendu Kumar Das (Calcutta University, 1945); 'Doctrine of Sakti in lodian Literatore' by Dr. P. C Chakravarti (1940). Vide Prof. Bagchi's 'Studies in the Tantras. pp 1-3 for the introduction of four Tāatrit texts in Kamboja (Cambodia) about 800 A, D, pamed Sirascheda, Vināsikba, Sammoba and Nayottara and Inscriptions from Kambaja' by Dr. R.

therefore it is called Tantra '. 1688 They can only be desoribed but one matter is included in almost all of them, vig, the five Makaras'. Often they contain an amalgam of religion, philosophy, superstitious dogmas, rites, astronomy, astrology, medicine, prognostications. They resomble the Purāṇas in several respects. The Buddhists deified many important per sonages of Buddhism and took over in course of time certain Hindu deities like Gaṇeśa and Sarasvati. Tantras are classified by comparatively later works into three groups, Viṣnukrānta, Rathakrānta and Aśvakrānta and 64 Tantras are assigned to each of the three groups (vide Tantrik Texts, vol. I. ed. by Arthur Avalon, Introduction pp. II-IV); but these numbers seem to be fictitious. The same Tantra is put in two classes by certain works. The Kulārṇava-tantra (III. 6-7) speaks of five ūmnāyas ( East, West, South, North and ūrdhva) as the paths to Moksa. The Paraśurāma-kalpasūtra 1689 I. % does the same. Besides, Tantrik worshippers are divided into three classes viz. Saiva, Śākta and Vaisnava. Bagchi states ("Studies in Tantras'p. 3) that Tantrik literature is classified into Srotas (which are three ) Pitha and Amnāya. The Saundaryalahari, ascribed by some to the great Advaita teacher Saṅkarācārya, refers to sixty-four Tantras (in verse 31 which begins 'catuṣṣaṣtyā tantraih' which, it is said therein, were declared by God Saṅkara for deluding 1690 the world.

have been published and we have now a fair idea of what the numerous Tantras must have been like. Some of the published Hindu Tantras are Kulārnava, Tantrasāra, Nityotsava, Parasuramakalpa-sūtra, Pārānandasūtra, Prapancasāra, Mantra mahodadhi of Mahidhara, Mahānirvāṇatantra, Rudrayāmala, Vāmakeśvaratantra, Sāradātilaka (about 11th century A. D.). Besides, there are works like the Tantrāloka and Malinlvijaya vārtika of Abhinava-gupta of Kashmir Tantrism. They stand somewhat apart from the works enumerated above. Among the published Buddhist tantras are; Advayavajrasangraba, Aryaman juśrimūlakalpa, Guhayasamāja-tantra (probably 6th century A. D.), Jõānasiddhi of Indrabhūti (717 A. D.), Nispan. nayogāvali of Abhayākaragupta (composed between the last quarter of 11th and first of 12th century A. D.), Prajñopāya viniscaya-siddhi of Anangavajra ( about 705 A. D.), Şat-cakra nirūpaña (1577 A.D.), Sadhanamala (containing 312 small works supposed to be from 3rd to 12th century A. D.). Of the Buddhist Tantras Aryamañjusrimūlakalpa and Guhyasamāja tantra 1691 are the oldest according to Dr. B. Bhattacharya (Intro. p. XXXVIII, to Guhya-samājatantra). Most of the above works have been published by Arthur Avalon (Sir. John Woodroffe) and in the Gaikwad Oriental Series. Some of the Hindu Tantras contain sublime philosophical views derived from the Upaniṣads and the Gitā or from the Saṅkhya and Yoga and the final goal according to them is Mukli (liberation from the

There is no evidence to prove that Gobyasamāja belongs to the 3rd or 4th century A.D. It is probably two or more ceaturies later than that; Bagcbl (Studios in Tantras' p. 41) is against identifying Agaiga, the author of Sadhana No. 159, with the great teacher of Yogācāra,

cycle of births and deaths) for all mon but to be secured by following the path laid down by the Tantras. As the number of published Hindu Tantras is considerable, reference will be made mainly to a few viz. Kulārṇava, Pārānandasūtra, Prapancasāra, Māhānirvāṇatantra, Vāmakeśyaratantra (Anan. ed.), Sakti. sangamatantra, Sāradātilaka and in the case of the Buddhist tantras to Aryamañjuśrīmūla-kalpa, Guhyasa mājatantra, Prajõopāyaviniscayasiddhi, Jhānasiddhi, Sadhanamāla, Sekodde satikā. The purpose of most Buddhist Tantras is to indicate a short path for attaining Buddha-hood through Yoga practices and they introduce the element of Sakti for Yogio practices and for securing miraculous powers (called siddhis). In the History of Dharmaśāstra not much need be said about Buddhist Tantras except for comparison and stress will have to be laid on the Hindu Tantras alone. The philosophical aspects of Tantrik culture may be studied in the Paraśurāmakalpasūtra, the Vāmakesvara-tantra, Tantrarāja, the works on Kashmir Saivism, works of Bhaskararāya, Bhāvanopaniṣad. This last is a late work dignified with the title of Upaniṣad, as it deals with bhāvanā and summarises the Vāsanāpatala of Tantrarājatantra (vide Intro, to the latter p. 3). There are also Vaisnava Tantras like the Gautamiya-tantra (D. C. ms. No. 1120 of 1886-1892) and Kramadipikā of Kesava (who was a successor of Nimbārka) with the commentary of Govinda Vidyāvinoda (published in the Chowkhamba S. series), which are not referred to in this work from considerations of space. Vide Agnipurāṇa 39. 1-7 for the names of twenty-five Vaiṣnava Tantras dealing with the establishment of Viṣṇu image and other matters and Māheśvara tantra 26. 16-20. 

The Hindu tantras which are supposed to have embodied dia logues between Śiva and Devi or Skanda or Bhairava and rarely others as in Dattatreyatantra (D. C. ms. No. 96% of 1887-91) endeavour to show that they bane themselves on the Vedas, Āgamas, Smṛtis and Purāṇas, that there is an easier and quicker way to the final goal of moksa and they often quote Vedic Verses. For example, in the Kulārnava, Siva says to Devi 'I churned the great ocean of Vedas and Againas with the churning handle of (correct) knowledge. I know the essence of these and took out the Kuladharma, 1692 that the Kaulaśāstras are autho.

ritative like Vedic texts and should not be nullified by ratiooina tion. The same Tantra further asserts 'one who has studied the four Vedas but is ignorant of Kuladharma is inferior to & candāla, while a capdala who knows Kuladharmas is superior to a brāhmaṇa. If all dharmas such as sacrifices, pilgrimages and vratas are put on one side and Kuladharma on another side, Kaula (dharma) is superior.'1693 It is, therefore necessary to understand what is meant by Kula or Kauladharma. The Guhya-samaja 169t states that Guhya means the three viz. body, speech and mind and 'samaja' means 'coming together', that Kula may comprehend five matters or three or 101 and that Guhya (as defined) is trikula.' God Saṅkara 16s deolared five tattvas, viz. wine, flesh, fish, mudra (hand and finger poses or the woman helper of a yogin) and sexual intercourse, that are aots that become the means for the attainment of the position of a vira and that the mantra of Sakti does not confer perfection unless one follows the practices of Kula; therefore a person

should be devoted to the Kula practices whereby he would attain to the sadhana of Sakti; wine, flesh, fish, mudra and sexual intercourse—these are declared to be the five tattvas in the procedure of the worship of Sakti. In another place the Mahanirvana 1696 says that the individual soul, prakrti, space, time, alkasa, earth, water, fire and Vayu-these are called 'Kula' and that way of life whereby one looks upon all these as brahma without distinction is called Kulācāra, that confers the four goals viz. dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa. The Śaktisangama tantra states that Kula means the upāsakas (worshippers ) 1697 of Kāli. The Kulārṇava states *Kula means gotra and that springs from Sakti and Siva; that man is called Kaulika who knows that mokea is secured from that (i. e. Sakti and Siva). Siva is called 'Akula' and Sakti is called 'Kula'; those who contemplate on Kula and Akula are the wise kaulikas." Various other definitions are given in Guhyasamāja ( Ist patala p. 6), in the Preface p. VIII of the Saktisangama-tantra, Tarakhanda But the same Tantra clinches the matter by declaring that " Śakti is known as Kula; her worship and the like are described ; that should be known as Kulācāra', which is difficult of attain ment even for gods. Worship, done with these alone viz. wine, flesh, fish, mudrā and sexual intercourse, is known as Kulācāra." The Pārānanda-sūtra 1698 provides that the highest self is one,

that there are seven Lords (Isvara ) viz. Brahma, Viṣnu, Siva, Sūrya, Ganesa, Sakti and Bhairava, that individual souls are countless, that there are three mārgas (patha) viz. Dakṣiṇa, Vama and Uttard, each succeeding one being superior to each preceding one, that Dakṣiṇa-marga is the one declared in the Veda, smrtis and purāṇas, that the Vāma (way) is declared by the Veda and Agamas, while the third (Uttara) is the one declared by the words of the Veda and of the Guru and that the Guruvākya is that of one's guru who is himself Jiran-mukta and who gives instruction as to & mantra. That sūtra further provides that the Vāmācāra is of two kinds, madhyama ( middling) and utlama (best), that uttana is the one which is concerned with wine, sexual intercourse and hand poses, while madhyama is one where all five, wine, flesh, fish, mudra and maithuna are resorted to. It should be noticed that the Tantras themselves designate the use of five makāras in worship as Vāmācāra and not their orthodox partisans of Yoga, as Heinrich Zimmer alleges in 'The art of Indian Asia' vol. I. p 130. Pārānandasūtra 1699 prescribes that the disciple has to undergo dikṣā (consecration) from a qualified guru, who instructs the disciple as to the mantra, who holds a mouthful of water in his own mouth and passes it into the mouth of the disciple that accepts the mantra while he gulpa down the water. This procedure applies if the guru is a brāhmaṇa, but if the guru is a ksatriya he should recite the mantra in the right ear of the disciple. The Tantraraja-tantra provides that the guru should wait for 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years according as the intending disciple belongs to the four varnas or to a mixed caste, should test bis qualities and devotion and then com municate to him the mantra; otherwise, both guru and disciple would come to grief (Tantrik Texts, vol VIII, II, 37-38). Most works on Tantra provide that the knowledge conveyed by the guru and worship with five makāras must be kept secret and if made public falling in hell is the result. Vide Parasurama kalpasūtra 1 12 and Saktigangama-tantra. 1700 After undergoing dikṣā and receiving the mantra the disciple has to follow the orders

of the guru till the former has & vision of the deity. 1701 Guru is higher than all other men, mantra is higher than guru, the deity is higher than the mantra and the highest self is higher than the devatā. In order to attain siddhis the guru is to be served by disciples with devotion in all ways. There is only one way viz. bhakti (devotion) for those (disciples) that long for worldly pleasures, heaven or mokṣa, as the Śruti says there is no other way. Jivan-mukti 1702 means to have a vision of the Deity worshipped' and one who is liberated, though living, is not tainted by his acts, whether meritorious or otherwise', This doctrine closely follows what is said in some of the Upaniṣads about the man who has realised brahma that he shakes off punya and papa and having cast aside the body he reaches the world of brahma; he does not return i.e. he never again undergoes samsāra'. One should strive for that stage. Therefore one who has obtained correct knowledge should become a bhakta (devotee). All these, viz.one in distress, the seekor after knowledge, one who seeks some desired object and one who has obtained correct knowledge, are noble, but the man, who has knowledge about God, when he becomes a devotee, reaches the world of the Highest Self, as the Vedic words say 'one who knows brahma reaches the Highest'. With all this sublime philosophy as the background the Pārānandasūtra frankly provides that the guru, after completing the worship up to the offering of a handful of flowers and having offered into firo somo food, should make a collection of makāras, should again come to the place for worshipping the Deity and offer food into fire, should hand over to the neophyte a bowl for drinking wine,

mudra, materials for dinner with oondiments and a courtesan and should instruct the neopbyte, that has accepted the three makāras (madya, mudrā and maithuna), as regards the kaula practices. 1703 Then the Pārānanda-sūtra devotes two pagos (16-17) to the kauladharmas taught to the neophyte, from which a few striking passages may be cited. “A young 1704 courtezan ia Sakti incarnate, is brahma; women are gods ans the very life-breath and are ornaments (of the world); they should not be censured nor angered"; "after worshipping the gods and gurus in the way laid down by the Veda and the Tantras & man does not incur sin if he drinks wine while remembering god or has sexual intercourse with a courtozan. He who partakes of wine and the rest merely for pleasing himself falls into a terrible hell. He who giving up the ordinances of śāstra acts as he pleases does not attain siddhi in this world, por heaven nor the Highest goal ( mokṣa). A worshipper should drink wine only up till his eyes do not begin to roll and up till bis mind does not become unsteady; to drink beyond that stage is bestial', The Paranandasātra (pp. 70-71) describes the procedure of a festival (Utsavavidhi) among Tantrikas. The mantra is 'Isvarātman, tava dasoham', which may be given to even a cāndāla or may be accepted from a cāndāla. It is further provided that the followers of Vāma-mārga may employ the following mantras about the three makāras, that the best among )

Vāmācāras should resort to. They aro: 'I take this holy nectar, which is a medioine ( antidote) for samsāra, which is a meang of cutting off the sparos by whioh the paśu (in man) is bound and which is deolared by Bhairava' (this when taking the first i. o. wine); I take this mudrā which is 'ucohista' of the Lord (i. e. which has been first offered to God), which destroys the torments of the heart, which produces joy and which 1705 is enriched with other food materials' (this when taking mudra); "I take this divine young woman who has drunk wine, that always makes the heart full of bliss and that brings about my sādhana' (when taking one of the women that are brought together ). 

The Hindu Tantra works present two sides, one philosophical and spiritual, the other popular, practical and more or less magioal, which relies on mantras, mudrās, mandalas, nyāsas, cakras and yantras as physical means to realize one's identity with the Supreme Power or Energy by concentration and as conferring extraordinary powers on the devotee. This may be illustrated by reference to two typical tantras, the Sāradātilaka and the Mahanirvāṇa-tantra. The Mahānirvana-tantra, though it speaks of the five makāras as means of upāsanā and though it states that when the great Tantra is understood, the Vedas, Puranas and śāstras are hardly 1705 of any use, puta forward the striking conception in IV. 34-47 that Parameśvara is one and to be described as sat, cit and ananda, that He is one without & second, is beyond the gunas and is to be known from the Vedanta texts. It further on says that the best mantra is 'om sac gidekam brahma'(III. 14), that those who perform the upāsanā of the Highest Brahma do not require other means of worship (sādbanā); by stioking to this mantra man becomes brahma. In the 4th chap. however, the Mahāpariniryāṇa starts by saying that Durgā is the highest praksti of Paramātmā, she has various names such as Kāli, Bhuvanośvari, Bagalā, Bhairavi, Ohhin namastakā, that she is Sarasvati, Lakṣmi and Sakti, that she aggumes various forms for securing the purpose of her devotees and for the destruction of demong.

to the knowledge of brahma and the man who possesses know ledge of brahma is a liborated soul, though living (he is Jivanmukla). Then there is high praise (IV. 10 ff) of Dev! who is spoken of as the primordial Sakti (adyā paramā sakti ) and all gods including Siva himself derive their powers from this Highest Sakti. A rather astounding statement is made in 1707 the words 'as there was partaking of wine and the rest in Satya, Tretā and Dyāpara yugas, one should do the same in Kali-yuga, but in accordance with the kula way, and that Kali does not affect those who give to the truthful Yogin the five tattvas ( wine &o.) sanctified according to the kula way'. Then & mantra of ten syllables is declared 'hrim srim krim parama. svari 170$ syābā', by merely listening to which a man becomes jivanmukta. Then by various combinations of the mystio syllables with Parameśvari and Kālikā twelve mantras are produced ( V. 18). But the mantras do not confer siddhi unless the kulācāra way is followed viz. the five tattvas madya'&o. ara offered (V, 22-23). Then a Gayatri Mantra is set out (V. 62-63) as adyayai vidmabe Paramośvaryai dhimabii tan-nah Kali pracodayat il', which is to be muttered thrice daily. The Saṅkhya tattvas, Prakrti, Mahat, Abankara &c. are welded on to the worship of Śakti and the Vedic mantra Hainsaḥ śuoiṣad' (Rg. IV. 40.5) with the Tāntrik bija Hrim ( V. 197). The Tantra gives directions for the sanctification of flesh (V. 203-208, where Rg. I. 22. 20 'tadvisnoḥ paramam padam' is employed), of fish (V. 209-210) where the mantra Tryambakam' (Rg. VIII, 59. 12) is employed, of mudrā (V. 211-212 where the mantras Tad Viṣpo” paramam' and 'tad-viprāso' Rg. I. 22.20 21, are employed) to be offered to Devi. The Mabanirvāṇatantra

As to the last tattva (maithuna) the sādhaka was to confine himself to the woman he chooses as his Śakti (VI. 14) and if his wife is alive he is not to touch another woman with a vicious intent, otherwise he would go to hell. 1710 In keeping with its desire to present respectability along with tantrik practicos, the Mahānirvāṇa devotes chapter VIII. to the duties of varnas and āśramas, the duties of the king, the duties of servants in general, provides 1711 that persons of all varnas are to marry within the varpa and dine with persong of the game varna, except when engaged in Bhairavi cakra and Tattva-cakra (VIII. 150), when men of all varṇas are like the best brāhmaṇas, and no consideration of the castes of the participants arises nor any question about ucchiṣta. It prescribes that no one has the adhikāra to engage in the performance of Tattvacakra unless he is & sādhaka endowed with knowledge of brahma. In that cakra the tattvas (wine and the others) should be collected and placed in front of the Devi, the mantra 'Hamgaḥ' (Rg. IV, 40.5) should be recited over all tattvas and the tattvas should be offered to the Highest Self with the verge. 'Brahmārpanam brahma havir' (Bhagvadgitā IV. 24 =Mahānirvāṇa VIII. 214)

and all the sadhakas should engage in drinking and eating. 1913 Chap. IX enumerates and describes ten sainskāras from garbhadhāpa to marriage for membors of the three varnas and nine for sūdras (omitting upanayanı), wherein Vodic mantrag are prescribed as in the Dharmasūtras and smrtis. One interest ing item is what is called Saira marriage, which is of two kinds, one entered into according to the rules of cakra and the other lasting for life. It is further provided that in Saiva marriage1713 no question of rarna or age arises and that if a man has children from a wife married in the brūhma form and also ohildren of a Saiva marriage, it is only the former that take as heirs and the latter are entitled only to food and raiment (IX 261-264). Chapters X, XI, XII of the Mabānirvāṇa deal respectively with śrūddhas, prāyaścitlas for sids and ryjarahāra. 

It is necessary now to turn to the Sāradātilaka which belongs to about the 11th century A. D. That work is divided into 25 patalas and contains over 4500 verse. It presents in the begin. ning a somewhat abstruse and involved philosophy. It says that Siva is both nirguna and saquna, the former being different from Prakrti, the latter being 8ssociated with Praksti. Then it describes the order of evolution and manifestation as follows: From the Saguna Parameśvara described as “Sac-cidananda vibhava' Sakti 1714 proceeds; from the latter arises nāda (para ) and from nāda arises bindu (para) which is divided into three viz. bindu (apara), nāda (apara ) and bija; the first is indentified with Siva, bija being Sakti and rāda being the coming together of the two (Śiva and Sakti). Sakti creates the worlds, she is sabda-bhahma (I. 56 ) and is called parāsakti (I. 52) and para deyatā (I. 57). She flashes like lightning in the adhāra-oakra. 1715

Sakti assumes the form of Kuṇdalini in the human body. From Sambhu in the form of bindu arise in order Sadasiva, Isa. Rudra, Viṣnu, Brahmā; from the avyakta bindu arise in order the mahat-tattva, abankāra and the other tattvas mentioned in the Sāökbya system. Sakti is all-pervading and yet more subtle than the subtlest, she is the Kundalini coiled like a serpent and manifests herself in the form of the fifty letters of the Sanskrit alphabet (from 'a' to 'kṣa'). 

Before proceeding further some explanation of the six cakras which form an important constituent subject of several tantras is needed. There are said to be six cakras (centres) in the human body viz. Adhāra or Mūlādhāra ( at the base of the spine), Svadhisthāna ( near the generative organ ), Manipūra ( near the navel), Anahata (near the beart), Visuddha ( near throat), and Ajõā (between the brows). Besides these, there is Brahma randhra figured as the pericarp of the thousand-petalled lotus 

(Continued from last pago) of a markuot in which plate I shows the positions of the six cakras also called lotuses (padma), plates II to VII facing pp. 356, 365, 370, 382, 392, 414 illustrate the six chakras from Mūlādbāra to Ajñā together with their colours, numbers of petals, letters, the devatās in each and other details. These are drawings used by the Yogis. Plate VIII facing p. 430 illustrates 'sahasrara'. Vide C. W. Leadbeater's work on the chakras' (Adgar, 1927), in which the author claims that the illustrations of the cakras represent them as they actually appear to those who can see them and on p. 56 he furnishes a table of the colours of the lotos petals as observed by Lead beater and his friends, and as described in षट्चक्रनिरूपण, शिवसंहिता and TOEIC. The Rudrayāmala (17th Patala, verse 10) speaks of Kandali as * Atbarvavedacakrasthā Kundali paradevatā', verses 21-24 speak of Kundalini passing from Mūladhāra-cakra and reaching the crown of the head that has the thousand-petalled lotus, that when united with Siva he (sādhaka) drinks nectar there, Rudrayāmala (27. 58–70) dilates on the six cakras and the Sabasrāra together with the dalas (petals) and letters assigned to each, A stern warning has to be given that none should try to experiment about the cakras by reading books or try to rouse the Kundalini except under the guidance of a real Master in Yoga, as otherwise very dangerous con sequences would follow. Even as regards wrong methods of Prāṇāyāna and Dhāraṇā, the Vayapurāṇa (chap. XI. 37-60 ) states that Yoga practices by ignorant men result in dullness of lotelligence, deafness, dumbness, blindness, loss of memory, premature old age and disease and it specifies cortala remedies to cure these defects. The present author know & person who practised prāṇāyāma continuously for long periods becoming atono deal, though otherwise be was strong and muscular, and an expert in bar diseason declared on examination that there was so possibility of his recovery by the methods of modern medical scionce.

within the crown of the head. The oakres are often indentified with the nerve plexuses of modern physiology, but the descrip tions in Sanskrit works of the Kundalini and the cakras are meant to refer not to the gross body but rather to what is situated in the subtle body that vanishes when a man dies. The idea of the relevant Sanskrit texts is that the Kundalini Sakti ('Kundalin' means & serpent) is asleep in the Mūlādhara-oakra coiled like a serpent and has to be roused by the practices of Yoga and deep meditation. 1716 The Sāradātilaka anks in an eloquent stanza the sādbaka to meditate upon the Kundalini which when roused passes from the Mūlādhāra-cakra by means of the Susumnā-nadi (which is in the contre of the spinal column) through all the six cakras, unites with Śiva in the Sahasrāra (thousand-petalled) cakra and then returns to Mlūlādbāra. Each of the six cakras is said to have a certain number of petals viz, 4, 6, 10, 12, 16, 2 (50 in all) in order from Mūlādbāra to Ajñā (vide Rudrayāmala, 17th Patala, verses 55-56). The letters of the alphabet also are 50 (from 'a' to * kṣa') and they are assigned in groups to the six cakras as follows : ha and kṣa to Ajña, 16 vowels to Visuddha in the throat, letters ka to tha (12 in all) to Anahata, letters Da to Pha (10) to Mapipūra, ba to la (6 in all) to Svādbiṣthāna, letters va to sa (4) to Mūlādhāra. Some tantrag state the colour of each of the six cakras and identify them with the five elements and the mind. These speculations of the Yoga and Tantras are

developments of the ancient Upaniṣad theories briefly noticed below, 1717 

Letters form words and words form mantras, that are the power incarnate of Sakti. Then the Sāradātilaka describes āgana, mandapa, kuṇda, mandala, pithas (on which images of gods are to be placed), diksa (initiation), prāṇapratiṣthā (vivifying images), production of sacrificial fire. The sāradā tilaka (I. 109 and V. 81-91), the Varivasyārahasya (II..80), the Paraśurāmakalpasūtra (I. 4, 'Şat-trimsat tattyāni visvam') and other Tantrik and Āgamic works enumerate 36 tattyag (including those of the sānkhya system). From chap. VII. to XXIII mantras of different deities, their formation, use and resulta, abhiṣekas and mudrās are described. Yantras are dealt with in chap. XXIV and Yoga in chap. XXV. It must be said to the credit of the Sāradātilaka that it treats of only mantras and mudrās and hardly anywhere treats of the other makāras. The Sāradātilaka has been profusely quoted as an authoritative Tantra by medieval Dharmaśāstra writers like Govindananda, Raghunandana, Kamalakara, Nilakantha, Mitramiśra and orthers. In J. G. J. R. I. vol. III. pp. 97-108 M. M. Gopinath Kavirāja contributes a learned paper on nāda, bindu and kalā and takes great pains to elucidate these and hopes that his exposition will make the meaning of these words clear (p. 103 ). But the author feels grave doubts whether most readers will find the meanings clear, 

Many tantras speak of the five makāres as the means of worshipping Devi, as enabling a man to possess miraculous

From the times of the Upaniṣads the heart is likened to a loto and it is said "There are hundred and one Nādis (arteries or veins) of the heart; one of them penetrales the crown of the head, moving upwards by it a man (who is emancipated) reaches immortality."

powers and as leading to final liberation. The Kularnava stater * the great Bhairava has proscribed that in the Kaula system Biddhi (perfection ) results from those very substances by (resorting to ) which (ordinarily ) men incur sin'. That means that the Kaula system eradicates poison by poison or, to employ modern terminology, its principles are like those of 

Homeopathy, 1718 

The Tantras seem to be not unaware that in prescribing the five makāras as leading to mukti (final liberation) they were playing with fire. The Kulārṇave itself remarks (II. 117-119 and 122) If by merely drinking wine a man were to attain siddhi (miraculous powers, perfection), then all wretched drunkards may attain siddhi. If, by merely eating meat a holy goal were to be secured then all meat-eaters in the world would be holy men. If by mere intercourse with a woman (called sakti) moksa was to result, then all men in the world may attain liberation. To follow the path (of Kula) is indeed more unattainable than walking on the edge of a sword, than clinging to a tiger's neck, than holding a serpent (in one's hand)'. The Kulārṇava prefaces the preceding dicta by the words 'Many, who are devoid of traditional knowledge and who profane ( the sāstra ) by false ideas, imagine that the Kaulika dootrine is this and that, relying on their (poor) intellect' (II. 116 ). 

The Devibhāgavata provides (XI. 1. 25) that so much of tantra as is not opposed to the Veda is undoubtedly authorita. tive ( vedāvirodhi cot tantram tat pramāṇam na samsayaḥ), but what is opposed to Veda is not authoritative. 

There appears to have been great rivalry between the Hindu and Buddhist tantras. The Saktisangama-tantra, one of the most popular and most exhaustive works on tantra, states that Dovi manifests herself for the destruction of Bauddha and other heretical sects, for the removal of the confusing admixture of

But in the context in which they are employed in the two vajrayāda toxts, it is rather difficult to hold that they are employed in any esoteric or symbolic sense.

different culty, for the establishment of the (true) oult, for the protection of what the brāhmaṇas stand for and for the perfect attainment of mantra-śāstra. 1719 The Bauddha tantras, on the other hand, were not slow to retaliate. 

It would not be entirely out of place if & fow words were devoted to the Bauddha Tantras, particularly of the Vajrayāna. It has already been shown above (pp. 943–44 note: 1516 ) that all Buddhists, whether of the hinayāna' or mahāyāna type, were required to observe strict rules and regulations such as those of pancasilas and of taking refuge with Buddha, Dharma and Sangha and of daśasllas (for monks). The goal of nirvana (particularly under Mahāyāna doctrines) could be reached only after a very long time or after several births. As luxuries viz. flesh, fish, wine and women had been banned, the general mass of the people and probably monks also were tired of the strict mode of life and long waiting for the goal. Buddhist Tantras like the Guhyasamāja (that belongs to the Vajrayāna school) provided an easy process by which liberation and even Buddha.. bood could be secured in a short time and even in 1720 one life and averred that Bodhisattvas and Buddhas attained the seat of dharma by enjoying all objects of pleasure as they 1721 pleased. The word Vajra means both diamond' and 'thunderbolt'. The first meaning appears to have been principally meant in the Guhyasamāja but the 2nd meaning also must have been some times intended. Vajra denotes anything which is hard like a diamond. In the Guhyasamājatantra the word Vajra, either singly or in compounds, Occurs hundreds of times. Kaya (body), Vak (speech) and citta (mind) are called trivajra' (Gulya, pp. 31, 35, 36, 43). Numerous other things 1922 are called 'vajra',

It also means the male organ in the mystic language of Saktas. Though the original Buddhist rules insisted on shimga, Guhyasamāja permitted several kinds of flesh, such as that of elephants, horses, dogs and even human 1723 flesh. Early Buddhism insisted upon truthfulness and continence ( brahma cerya); vajrayana, being an innovating revolt, allowed the killing of all animals, speaking untruth, intercourse with women (including even incest with the mother, sister 1724 and daughter) and appropriating:wealth not donated by any one. This was called vajramārga (the path of vajra), which is said to have been the dootrine of all Buddhas. 

The Prajñopāya (I. 20 ) describes the stato reached by the Vajrayāna method as follows. 'It is neither duality por 100, duality, it is full of peace, beneficent, present everywhere, to be realised by one's own self, steady (unchanging), undisturbed and full of Prajina (wisdom) and Upaya (activity with compas.

Śtate reached by Vajrayāna method 1087 sion) and it further provides (V. 22-23) that by those who hanker after liberation perfection of wisdom must be sought (resorted to or adored) in all ways. This perfection of wisdom is everywhere present assuming the form of woman'. Prajña was linked up with an intense state of emotion called Sukha or Mahāsukha (great bliss ). " It being of the nature of endless bliss is designated mahāsukha; it is beneficent all round, most eminent and conduces to complete enlightenment' (Prajñopāya. I. 27) and this all Buddha knowledge which is by its nature to be experienced by one's inmost self is called Mahāsukha (great bliss) since it is the most eminent of all pleasures' (Jñānasiddhi VII. 3). The word Prajñā is feminine in gendør and therefore some Vajrayāna writers identified Prajñā with woman; by erotio symbolism and far-fetched analogies the cult of woman was started. 

Dr. H. V. Guenther has published a book styled 'Yuga naddha' propounding the Tāntrik view of life based only on Buddhist Tantras and endeavours to prove in that work (of about 190 pages) that the Buddhist Tāntrikas try to restore life in its entirety, which is neither an indulgence in passions nor a rejection and escape, but a complete reconciliation to the hard facts of life, that the sexual aspect of the Tantras is but the corrective against the one-sided intellectualism and rationalism of mere philosophy which is unable to cope with the problems of everyday life and that the symbol of Yuganaddha points to the unique harmony and interpenetration of masculinity and feminity, of blunt truth and symbolic truth, of intellect and humanity. It is not possible even to summarize this work or criticize it here. The core of the doctrine of the Vajrayana tantras is found in the passages quoted in notes 1720-21, 1723-84. The argument is: according to these Tantras perception of wholeness is the most joyous of all human experiences and man's experience will not be full but only partial if he has dio experience of feminity i. e. of everything fomale. He may expertendo feminity through all female members of his family. Thorefore, it is not to be wondered at, says Dr. Guenther, that this er. perionoe so often has an incestuous character'. Then he offers (on pp. 106-11%) a lengthy explanation of what he means which, the prosont author has to confoss, is not quite clear to his moderato mental abilities. Dr. Guenther appears to be steeped in all the latest theories of modern psychologists like those of Freud and tries to expound that Buddhist author of the 8th century A. D. Like Anangavafra and Indrabhu had plumbed the depths at the

psychical life on the lines of modern psycho-analysis. Granting for a moment all that Dr. Guenther says about bi-sexuality, about sexual partnership being the best expression for the most intimate relation between two opposites, about woman being for the malo a material object and a goddess, the present writer feels that one question appears to have been not satisfactorily answered or explained, viz. why did not the Buddhist Tantrikas simply exhort the sādhaka to understand the emotions, view points and value of woman as a mother, sister, wife, daughter or as a woman in general and why did they frequently and blatantly harp upon sexual intercourse of even an incestuous kind as a quick method of realizing the goal ? 

The Guhyagamāja-tantra puts forward a quick and short method for realising Buddhahood and for the attainment of miraculous powers (siddhis) through the processes of Yoga. The siddhis are said to be of two kinds, Sāmānya (ordinary, 1725 such as becoming invisible) and Uttama (highest i, e. attaining Buddhahood). Four means for securing ordinary siddhis are mentioned and they are called Vajra-catuska. It is further provided that the best ṣiddhi is acquired by the nectar of knowledge due to the six angas 1726 of Yoga (and by no other way) viz. Pratyābāra, Dhyāna, Prāṇāyāma, Dhāraṇā, Anusmrti and Samādbi. It is worthy of note that the first three angas of yoga mentioned in the Yogagātra viz. yama, niyama 1771 and asana are omitted and a new one, Anusmrti, is added Yama could not be included because to the Guhyasamaja it did not matter if the sādhaka ate flesh, or indulged in sexual intercourse or told lies, while in Yogasūtra yamas are ahimsā, salya (truthfulness), asteya (not appropriating anything that does not belong to one), brahmacarya (sexual purity) and aparigraha (non-acceptance of gifts). Niyames could not be inoluded because among the five

niyamas are svādhyāya (Vada study) and (Isvaraprapidhāna ) devotion to or surrender to God. Many Bauddhas reviled the Veda and acknowledged no Supreme Deity. The Guhyasamāja introduced Yogio practices for quickly securing Buddhahood. The idea of allowing flesh and sexual intercourse seems to have been that the Yogin is to be indifferent as to what he does 80 long as he is striving for the goal of Buddhahood, for development of his psychic life and that he may disregard all social conyon tions and rules. 1728 Another innovation of the Vajrayāna was the introduction of upāsanā of Sakti for liberation through Yoga. The Guhya-samāja provides that if even after making efforts for six months, the sādhaka has no realisation, ho may repeat his offorts for three times more and if even after that he has no enlightenment he should resort to Hathayoga and then he would attain correct knowledge through Yoga. A further innovation was the theory of the five Dhyāni-buddhas, 1729 emanating from 

the Bhagavān, who represent the five Skandhas or fundamental principles of which the whole creation is composed and each of whom was associated with a female Sakti. The teaching of the Guhyasamāja is that if psychical power and miraculous siddhis are to be developed females must be associated with those who undertake Yogic exercises to achieve their enda. Thus the prophecy of the founder of Buddhism pronounced, when yielding to the pressure and entreaties of his favourite disciple Ananda for allowing women to be members of the sangha and to be nuns, that on account of this innovation his system would atand fast only for five hundred years, though otherwise it would have lasted for a thousand years, was literally fulfilled (vide Cullavagga

X. 1. 6 in Vinaya Texts, vol. III, S. B. E. XX. p. 325). If we accept 483 B. O. as the date of Buddha's Parinirvana ( as many scholars hold) or 477 B. C. (as A. Foucher bolds) 500 years therefrom would bring us to the first century A. D. and it is clear that by a century or two after that time much of Buddha's teaching appears to have been almost completely swamped by doctrines of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Tantras, By a strange irony of fate Buddha's 'dharma-cakra-pravartana' came to be transformed into 'adharma-cakra-pravartana' by many of his so-called followers of the Vajrayana. In the Mabā-parinibbana autta V. 23 ( S. B. E. vol. XI. p. 91 ) the Buddha was very strict and warned bhikkhus not to see bhikkhunis, not to talk to them if they could not avoid seeing them, and to be wide awake if & nun talked to them. Buddha severely rebuked one of his disciples for showing his miraculous powers (vide p. 1037 and 2. 1672 above), but Guhyagamāja and other Buddhist tantras make provision for endowing the sādbaka with miraculoug powers, such as causing rainfall in case of drought (Guhya Bamāja p. 84), killing an enemy by magical rites over an effigy of the enemy (ibid. p. 96). Besides, the Guhyasamāja knows the gix cruel or terrible magic acts (called 'satkarmāṇi), viz. Sānti (rite for averting disease or black magic), vaśikarana (bewitching women and men and even gods ), stambhana (stop ping the movements or actions of others), vidveṣana (creating enmity between two friends or two persons who love each other ), uccātana (making a person or enemy flee from the country, town or village), mārana (killing or causing permanent injury to living beings). The Guhyasamaja mentions these six ( putting * Akarṣaṇa ' for 'vidveṣana') respectively at pp. 168, 165, 96, 87 (Akarṣaña), 81, 130. Vide Sadhanamālā pp. 368-369 for the same and for the shape of mandalas and times for each of the six cruel rites. Even the rather sobor Saradātilaka-tantra mentiong these six (23. 12%), defines them (23. 123-125), provides that Rati, Vāṇi ( speech or Sarasvati), Ramā, Jyoṣths, Durgā and Kāli are respectively the six deities of these six cruel acts and must be worshipped at the commencement, that six periods of ten ghatikās from suprise are respectively appropriate to these six and so also are certain seasons (23, 126-139). It is most astounding that the Prapaõoasāra (23.5) asoribed to the great advaita teacher Saṅkardoārya describes at length a mantra called Trailokya-mohana for accomplishing the aboy si cruel acts. 

Tantras emphasize importance of guru 

1071 

Both Hindu and Buddhist Tantrag1730 lay great emphasis on the importance and qualifications of the guru. The Bauddha Tantras have the highest praise for the guru. The Jūlnasiddhi (13.9-12) proscribes high qualifications and the Prajiopāyavini soaya-siddhi (III, 9-16 ) contains a grand eulogy of the guru, identifying him with Buddha and calling him omniscient and 80 on. The Advayasiddhi of Laksmiðkarā (about 729 A. D.), who started the astounding doctrine that one should offer worship to one's own body wherein all gods reside, says that in the three worlds there is none higher than the ācārya. In the Nityotgava of Umānanda-nātha, pupil of Bhāgurānanda-nātha (i. . Bhāskararāya as he was called before he took diksa) the guru Bhāskararāya is praised in the following hyperbolical terms 1731 to whom no part of the earth was unseen (owing to his yogic sight), there was no king who was not his slave, to whom no śāstra was unknown; why use more words, whose form was the highest Sakti herself.' But the Jõāna-siddhi and Kulārpava (XII. 128 ) ward against gurus who falsely pretend to know the truth and give instruction in dharma from greed for money. The Kulārpava ( ullāsas XI and XII) are devoted to the quali fications and greatness of guru. The Sāradātilaka also sets out the qualifications of the tāntrika guru (II. 142–144 ) and of the disciple (:III. 145–152). 1732 The guru among other matters 'must know the essence of all Āgamas and the principles and meaning of all śāstras, he must be one whose words come out true, who has a quiet mind, who has profoundly studied the Veda and its meaning, who follows the path of Yoga and whose bearing is as beneficent as that of a deity. Among the many requirements about a disciple, 1733 one is that he must keep secret the mantra and pājā imparted by his guru. The disciple places the guru's feet on his head and surrenders his body, wealth and even life to

the guru, The necessity of a guru for the aoquisition of esotorio philosophy is stronged by the Upaniṣads also. For, example the Kathopaniṣad 1734 says this knowledge cannot be obtained by ratiocination, it can be understood well only when expounded by another'; the Chandogy& (IV.9.3) says 'Sir, I have heard from men like you that only knowledge that is learnt from a teacher leads to real good'. The Lingapurana1735 and others say that guru is identical with Siva and the rewards of devotion to Siva and to the guru are the same. The Kularnava (XI.46) emphasizes that the order of the succession of gurus, the Āgamus, Āmnāya, mantra and practiceg-all these when learnt from the lips of a guru become fruitful and not otherwise. The Prapanca. sāra provides the disciple should consider in his mind that guru, devatā and mantra are one and should repeat a hundred times the mantra that he received by the favour of the guru.' 

The Vedānta system requires for its understanding high intellectual and moral attainments and could be followed by only a few gifted souls. It is claimed that Tantras provide & method which assists mon of ordinary intellect and which utilizes visual and physical processes for the attainment of spiritual experience, for the development of psychio forces and for the quick attainment of liberation by suoh practices as the repetition of mantras, mudrās, nyasa, mandalas, cakras and yantras. The respect for the guru sometimes reached amongat Tāntrik writors to extreme and disgusting lengths as the note below will indicate.1736

Perverse Tantrik practices and Sanskrit Literature 

1073 

The teaching of Tantrika texts about the five makāras must have created & very unhealthy and debased state among all classes, particularly the lower orders of Society. The centuries from the 7th to the 12th A. D. were the peak period of Tantrik works and cults, both Hindu and Buddhist. In & certain cult of the Vajrayāna the gurus wore a blue yesture. A story is narrated of a guru (a monk) of the sammitiya sect who went dressed in a blue dress to a courtezan. He did not return to the monastery at night. When asked in the morning by his disciples why he put on a blue dress, he explained the great spiritual merit of the blue-coloured dress. Since then his followers began to wear blue dress and in their book called 'Nilapatadarsana' it is written the god Kāmadeva (Eros) is a jewel, a courtezan is & jewel, wine is a jowel; I bow to these three jewels; other so-called jewels are three glass beads'. It should be remembered that for devout Buddhists, Buddha, Dharma and Sangha are three Ratnas (jewels). The followers of the Nilapatadarśana deemed these last three to be as worthless as glass beads. Vide Bhikṣu Rahula Sāṅkstyāyana's paper 'On Vajrayāna or Mantrayana ' in J. A. vol. 225 (1934) p. 216 where this is narrated Valge gurus must have gone about deluding people with rosy prospects of bliss and liberation by the easy method of drinking wino, eating flesh and free association with all sorts of women. The Indian literature of those centuries is full of condemnation and caricatures of the methods of Tāntrik worship by means of wine, flesh and sexual laxity. A few instances may be cited here. In the prākrit play called Karpūramañjarl of Rajasekhara (about 900 A. D.), a character called Bhairavananda 1737 who was

Even gods headed by Visnu and Brahma declare that liberation is attained by meditation, Veda study and performance of Vedic sacrifices; only one God, the husband of Umā, perceived that mokṣa (oan be attained) by dalliance with women and by wine'. The Yaśastilaka-campū (composed in 959 A.

The Daśavatāra-carita of Kṣomendra (3rd quarter of 11th century A. D.) states in one verse what the Tantrik gurus and their followers did “Gurus declare that liberation follows by the drinking of wine from the same goblet by various craftsmen such as washermen, weavers, workers in hides, kāpālais, in the procedure of cakrapūjā, and by dalliance with women without the least scruple and by always leading a life of festivities." 1739 The Rāja-tarangini (middle of 12th

In V. 66 Kalhana says that during 1740 the reign of Avantivarman of Kashmir, siddhas ( persons possessed of mira culous powers like animā) such as Bhatta Kallata were born for the benefit of the world. In describing the effects of the rule of a good king Yasaskara (1939–948 A. D.), Kalhana 1741 remarks that during his reign were not seen housewives figuring as divinities at the rite of gurudikṣā and shaking their heads for detracting from the eminent character (attributed to) of their husbands.' King Kalasa of Kashmir (1063-1089 A. D.) became a pupil.of Pramadakaptha, son of Amarakantha who was a good brahmana, but Kalaśa, who by nature was evil-minded, was instructed in evil practices by his guru Pramadakantha and the latter made the former ignore the distinction between women who are approachable and who are not. In this connection, Kalhana bitterly 1742 bewails "what other unscrupulousness of this guru (of Kalasa) should be described by me, when, leaving aside all scruples, he committed incestuous intercourse with his own daughter." This establishes that in the 11th century A. D.

in Kashmir there were Tantrik gurus that literally carried out what the Guhyasamājatantra quoted in note 1724 apparently recommended to Buddhist Yogis. In the drama called Moba parajaya by Yaśabpāla under king Ajayadeva, successor of Kumarapāla, among the dramatis personge is a kaula who declares his doctrine to be eating flesh every day, drinking wine without any qualms and allowing the mind free scope.178 Apararka quotes a verse which shows that, in the midst of numerous cults, it was difficult to be consistent: "A person may be at heart a Kaula ( follower of the Kula doctrine), in outward appearance he may look a Saiva, and he may follow Vaidika rites in his usual practices. One should live grasping what is essential like the cocoabut 1741 fruit". It appears that great scholars and poets had a speaking admiration for Tantrika worship. The great writer Vidyāpati of Mithilā appears to be a Vaisnava from his devotional songs, but wrote the Saivazarvasvasāra (80 he day be called a Saiva), and wrote also Durgābhaktitarangipi (and thus appears to have been a Sākta) and composed also a Tantrik 1745 work. The very first verse of Vidyāpati's 'Purusa pariksa' contains an invocation of Ādi-Sakti' Bengal and Assam were the strongholds of Sākta doctrines and even DOW Kāli worship is still in vogue there, but it was the great Bengal

Possible motives for debased Tantra practices

king Ballklasena who discarded Devipurāṇa 88 an authority in his encyclopaedic work on gifts called Dānasāgara. 1746 

It is possible that the founders of the Tantrik or Sakta cult: of the five makāras threw defiance at the terrible aspect of God or the Highest Spirit, that rules the destinies of men and things and that made men sometimes suffer terribly even if they led lives of virtuo, to do the worst for their disregard of conyen tional morality and social practices and hoped by their Yoga exercises to attain to high psychical powers and bliss. 1747 There is another possible motive also. Masses of common people were being drawn towards Buddhism. The founders of Hindu Tāntrik cults wanted to retain them within the Hindu fold. As common people drank wine and ate meat, they were told that they would attain higher spiritual levels even while indulging in meat and drink provided they followed Tantrik gurus and practices. 

The idea was that Sakti was all and was for all; bhoga (enjoy. ment) need not be given up, as man is part of Devi or Siva. Bloga should be sublimated, that is all that is required in Kaula. śāstra. The Tāntrikas 1748 substitute a yoga of enjoyment (bhoga) for the yoga of abstinence and asceticism, When indulging in the left-hand path practices the sādhaka is supposed or held to be destroying the egoistic elements of the soul. 

The Mahānirvāṇatantra and a few others endeavour to stom the tide of sexual immorality and promiscuity. For example, Rāmeśvara, the commentator of Paraśurāmakalpasūtra, says that one that has not conquered his senses has no adhikāra for Kaulamārga (p. 153). This is in direct conflict with what even the Mahānirvāṇatantra says that all men from brāhmaṇas to the untouchables have adhikāra for Kula practices. Modern apologists for Tāntrism emphasize that the instructions embodied in the Gubyasamāja, the directions for the mode of life to be led by followers of Vajrayāna, apply only to the Yogis who have attained some degree of yogic perfection. But the obvious

reply is who is to decide that a particular person had attained the minimum spiritual level except the man himself and, pupposing that all the directions were meant for Yogis, why was it necessary to say in a blatant manner and language that a Yogi practising Vajrayana may engage in what common and less sophisticated people deem to be incest? This is not the place to reply to all apologists for ancient and medieval Tāntrik works. But a few must be dealt with because they are liable to create misunderstandings, if allowed to go uncriticized. In his Preface to Principles of Tantra' Part 2, Sir John Woodroffe statos (p. IX.) that the use of flesh, fish and wine was common in the Vedic age and that the Mahābhārata and some Puriṇas like the Kālikā, Mārkandeya and Kūrma refer to consumption of wine, meat and fish. This looks like special pleading and is misleading. The question is: was sirū offered to the gods in every day or periodic sacrifices as an offering in the Roveda or any other Veda. In the Vedic age wine may have been known and even drunk, but what is material to recognize is that there is a difference made between Soma and surā. Vida Sat. 176 Br. "Soma is truth, prosperity, light and surā is untruth, nigary and darkness" (V. 1. 5. 28). While Soma is mentioned hundreds of times in the Rgveda, has the 9th mandala of the Rgveda specially reserved for its praises and was offered to gods, the word surū occurs only six times in the Rgveda and it is nowhere expressly stated that it was offered to any god as & religious offering; on the contrary, in a hymn to Varuṇa, burā is put for ward as leading to the commission of sin just as anger and gambling do (Rg. VII. 86.6 'na sa svo. dakso Varuna dhrutih sā surā manyur-vibhidako acittih). In bis zeal for the vindica tion of Tantrism Arthur Avalon is injudicious enough to misinterpret simple words. In the Intro. to Principles of Tantra'p. VII be quotes Rg. I. 166.7 "arcantyarkam madirasya pitaye" and translates "worshipping the Sun before drinking madira (wine)." The word here is madira (and not 'madirā'), it is an adjective and means "exhilarating". The word “Madirā" never occurs in the Rg. while "madira" as an adjec tive, occurs at least sixteen times and qualifies Soma, Indu, Amsu, Rasa or Madhu, generally expressed (and rarely implied). There is no word for "before." That quarter means "they (the worshippers or Maruts) worship (Indra) who is worthy of praise (and a friend of the Maruts) in order that he may come for

drinking the exhilarating (Soma). The word madirā (for wine ) hardly ever occurs in any genuing work of Vedic times. Its earliest oocurrence is probably in the Mahābbārate. Reference is also made by modern apologists to the offering of surā in the Sautrāmaṇl iṣti in honour of Indre But the circumstances are peculiar, Sautrāmani is only one out of numerous sacrifices and the occasions for performing it were rare i.e. it was per formed at the end of Rājagūya and also at the end of Agnicayana and when a priest who had drunk too much of soma vomited. The most important fact, however, is that the remnants of surā offered in Sautrāmani were not drunk by the priests engaged in it but a brāhmaṇa bad to be hired for drinking the remnants and if no brāhmaṇa could be secured then the remnants were to be poured over an ant-hill (vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1226 for details). The Kathakagamhitā 1750 contains an interesting passage "Therefore an elderly person and a youngster, the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law, drink liquor and remain babbling together; thoughtlessness is sin; therefore a brāhmaṇa does not drink surā with the thought that otherwise (if I drink it) I may be tainted by sin'; therefore this is for ksatriya; one should say to a brāhmaṇa that surā, if drunk by & ksatriya, does not harm the latter." These passages show that not only the priests did not drink surā even in Sautrāmapi but that it had become difficult to hire & brāhmapa for drinking it by the time of the Kathaka-gamhitā. The passage of the Vajasaneya Samhita 19.5 relied on at p. VII (of Intro to Principles of Tantra' part II) also refers to Saytrāmaṇi and to no other gagri fice. The mantra is "Brahma kṣatram pavate toja, indriyam surayā - somaḥ suta asuto madāya" and means that: "Soma when mixed with surā becomes a strong drink and leads to intoxication." The Chandogya V. 10. 9' (q. above p. 1578 n. 943') counts the drinker of surā among the five grave sinners. There fore, there is hardly any analogy between the offering of wine in Sautrāmaṇi and the teaching about offering wine. to Doyl as provided in the Tantras. Similarly, the : reference to the Atharyaveda as containing magical rites. does not help at all. Society had advanced far beyond that-stage and Manu XI. 63 looked upon abhicāra (i. o. performance of a magio rite like Syenayāga for killing a person) and mūlakārmda (i. e. bringing

under one's control a person or a woman by herbs and mantras) as a sin, though a legger one (an upapātaka). The reference to the Mahābhārata (Udyogaparya, 59.5 ff) is again misleading. Wine was drunk by people in the Mahābhārata times, but not as part of a religious ritual as in the Tantras. Vide pp. 964-966 of H. of Dh. vol. III for a note on 'intoxicating drinks.' The reference to Mārkaṇdeya and other purāṇas is of no avail as evidence, since at least the present author holds that those parts of the Puranas were written and interpolated after Tantrik rites had taken a firm hold on some sections of the Hindu society. The reference to sexual intercourse in the Mahāvrata 1751 is most misleading. In the Tantras like the Kulārṇava and the Guhya. samāja it is the sādhaka himself who is to practise maithuna as one of the ways of securing marvellous powers and higher spiritual attainments. But in the Mahāvrata the sexual inter course is by strangers to the sacrifice (and not by the yajamāna nor by any of the priests ), is a purely symbolical act and beans 20 analogy to a sādhaka himself engaging in maithuna as a religious rite to placate the Devi. Even & late reformist work like the Mahānispāṇa (VIII. 174-175) expressly says that those of the five tattvas which a sādhaka can secure, such as flesh and others, should have recited over them the mantra 'ām, hrim, krom, svābā' a hundred times, that he should reflect that every thing is & product of brahma, should close his eyes, should offer those to Kāli and should himself drink and eat them. As the Tantrik prescriptions of the makāras for attainment of mira culous powers and of liberation had shocked people and bad brought the tantras into great disrepute, later Hindu Tāntrik works like the Saktisangamatantra (between 1555-1607 A. D.) began to offer symbolic interpretations. They 1752 say that the

words 'madya, mudrā, maithuna' &o. are not used in this ordinary popular sense but in a special esoterio sense. .. For example, mudrā has several sensos, viz. a mixture of jaggery and ginger, or of salt and oil-cake or garlic and tamarind fruit, or wheat and māṣa beans, that madya (wine) is not what is prepared from mādbavi ( spring flower) but it springs from the joyful experience (or rasa) of Sakti, when effort is made to awaken the Kundalini. It may be admitted that some Tantrik works and writers divide men into three classes, paśu (the bestial ones), vira (those that have made great progress on the path of spiritual discipline) and daiva (those who are godlike). As regards these three, the five makāras are assigned by some apologistio writers different meaninge. D. N. Boge in his work *Tantras, their philosophy and occult secrets' boldly' asserts (p. 110) that the real significance of the five makāras has been deliberately perverted by vicious people and explains (p: 111) that madya is the nectarine stream issuing from the cavity of the brain where the soul resides, matsya means suppression of vital airs, māṁsa means yow of silence,' 'maithuna' means 'meditation on the acts of creation and destruction. ..: 

The Tāntrikas clothe their practices in bombastic and high. sounding words. The five makāras are called pañca-tattvas; kuladravyas or kulatattvas. Maithuna is generally referred to 28 parcamatattva, the woman with whom sexual intercourse iṣ to be had or who was at least to be associated with a male in Tantra worship is called Sakti (vide Kulārnava VII 39-43 and Mahānirvana VI, 18-20) or praksti or latā and this special ritual is called 'Latāsādhana' (Mahānirvāṇa I. 52). Wine is called tirthavāri (holy water) or kāraṇa (VIII.168 and VI. 17.) The Mahānirvana-tantra, though a reformist work and in certain oases asking the king to punish drunkards (XI. 113–121),

waxes eloquent over wine and praises it as Tara in the form 1750 of a fluid substance, as the saviour of individual souls, as the mother (or producer) of bhoga (enjoyment) and mokṣa (libera tion) and as the remover of misfortunes and diseases and after some further praise of wine winds up by saying that those men who drink wine according to the rules and with a well-controlled mind are gods on earth (XI. 108). For the worship of Sakti the five tattvas are absolutely necessary (Mahānirvana-tantra V. 21-24 quoted in note 1695 above and 1754 Kulārnava V. 69 and 76). Some tantras say that the meaning of tattva differs according as the person concerned is Tamasika (a paśu kind of worshipper), Rājasika (a vira as he is called), sāttvika (a divya, a person who is godlike). Madya means according to various Tantrik Texts real wine as well as a substitute like cocoanut water or any other liquid; it also means that intoxicating know ledge that comes of Yoga practices, whereby the worshipper becomes senseless as regards the external world. Maisa is the Bot whereby the sādhaka surrenders himself and his action to Lord Siva Matsya (fish, of which the first part 'mat' means 'mino') is that psychical state by which the worshipper sympa thizes with the pleasure and pain of all beings. Maithuna is the union of the Sakti Kundalini (the woman inside a man's body) in the Mūlādbāra-cakra with the supreme Śiva in the Sahasraracakra in the highest centre of the brain and is the stream of the sweet juice that drops from the Sabasrāra. Preparar tion of hemp (called vijayā or 'bhang') is madya for some. The Mahāniryāṇa says (VIII. 170 and 173) that 'madhura-traya' may be substituted for wine and for 'Maithuna' meditation on the foot of the image of ) Devi and japa of the desired mantra may be substituted. The Kaulavallnirnaya (III. 111) boldly states that if a man, after partaking of vijaya (bhāng) ongages in meditation, he sees directly before him the form of the goddess as described in the Dhyanamantra.

'. . Bsoteric meaning of i madya iOss 

Kaulajñananirnaya and Bhaskarariya 1755 in his commentary on Lalitigahasranama say that when Kundalini in roused by & yogin and it reaches the thousand-patalled cakra (Sahasrara ) from whioh (that has on its perioarp the moon) drops neotar which is figuratively spoken of aa madya (vide notes 1716, 1752). The Kularnava at first asserts (I. 105-107) Mukti does not result from the study of the Veda nor by the study of sastras, it results from (correct) knowledge alone, that the aśramas are. not a means of mokṣa por are the darśanas the means, nor all the sastras, that it is knowledge alone that is the cause, that it is the knowledge imparted by the teaching of the guru that confers mukti, all (other) vidyās are mockery.' Then in the Vedāntic strain it affirms (I. 111-112) "two words ( respectively) lead to bondage or liberation viz. (this is) mine' or nothing la mine'. A person falls in bondage by the thought 'this is mine' and becomes liberated by realising nothing is mine and that that is proper action that does not lead to bondage and that is real lore that leads to liberation." After these high thoaghts the bame Tantra (II. 22-23 and 29 ) proceeds to Kaula doctrine. If & man is a yogin he does not (ordinarily) enjoy life, while one who enjoys life does not know yoga; but the Kaula doctrino combines both yoga and bhoga and is superior to all (other doctrines); in the Kaula dootrine bhoga turns into yoga directly, what is sin ( acc. to ordinary people) becomes meritorious, samsāra turns into mokṣa. Kaula knowledge enlightens him whose mind is purified by the mantras of Saiva worship, Durg worship &o." 

The Kulārnava appears to be in two minds to ordinary men like the present writer. While in one breath as shown in note 1718 it frankly recommends the drinking of wine and eating of flesh to the followers of Kaula doctrine, it also endeavours to give an esoteric meaning to the makāras as follows (V. 107-112): Frequently reaching the brahmarandhra from the mūladhara, there arises the bliss of the union of the Kuṇdalini-Sakti with the moon in the form of Intelligence (at, Siva); the person who is intent on tasting the nectar oozing from the lotus in the

The (Yogin) who restraining the several sonses by his mind concentrates them on the Self, becomes 'matayāsı', 1737 others are only killera of living beings. The Sakti (the woman associated with a sādhaka ) of a beastly man is unonlightened but that of the Kaulika is enlightened; he who honoura (or resorts to ) such & Sakti is really & worshipper of Sakti. When a man is filled through and through with the bliss due to the union of the Highest Sakti with the Self (Siva), that is called Maithuna (copulation); all other men are merely licentious persons. 

. The apologists for unpopular Tantrik practices offer explana. tions of the five 'makāras' more or less on the lines of the Kulār anava. For example, in his Introduction to the Principles of Tantra' (part II) Arthur Avalon (Sir Jobn Woodroffe) gives (pp. OVII-CVIII) an esoteric explanation of the word 'drinking' used in such a verge as that in the Paranandasūtra, 'Having drunk again and again, having fallen upon the earth, then having got up and again drunk (wine) there is no rebirth.' 1758

He explains 'Boing thus awakened Kundalinl enters the great road to liberation (mukti), that is, the Sushumna nerve, and penetrating the centres one by one, ascends to the Sahasrara and there coming in blissful communion with the Lord of Lords, again descends down through the same passage to the Mūla dhāra Chakra. Nectar is said to flow from such communion. The sādhaka drinks it and becomes supremely happy. This is the wine called Kulāmṛta, which a sādbaka of the spiritual plane drinks...... In reference to a sādhaka of the spiritual (adhyātmika ) class the Tantra says 'Pityā pitvā...vidyato, During the first stage of Şat-cakra-sādbanā the sādhaka cannot suppress his breath for a sufficiently long time at a stretch to onable him to practise concentration and meditation in each centre of Power.

He must consequently come down upon the earth i.e. the Mūlādhāra, which is the centre of the element earth, after having drunk of the heavenly ambrosia. The sādhaka must practise this again and again and by constant practice, the Cause of rebirth i. e, vāsanā (desire) is removed." This explana. tion sounds very profound and highly psychical, but it is not at all convincing. Similarly, the present author wonders how many writers on Tantras and how many Tāntrikas understood the theory of sublimation put forward in Tantras as a way of realization' (Cultural Heritage of India, Vol. IV, pp. 233-235) by way of explaining the insistence on five makāras. The first question is: why was it necessary to employ vulgar language to describe a state of profound bliss ? Supposing the explanation of madya offered by Woodroffe is accepted, what is the explana tion about offering flesh and fish? One cannot easily get out. of matsyası' and 'mārgāśi' the esoteric sense required by the apologists. The Kulārṇava, the Pārānanda-sūtra and several

The Kulārpava quotes (II. 126 ) the verge of Manu IX, 93 (surā vai malam-annānām &o.), provides for the preparation of the three kinds of surā (V. 15-21), and says (V. 30 ) that surā la the 12th kind among intoxicants and that there are eleven other kinds of intoxicants made from jack-fruit, grapes, dates, sugar oane &o. (V. 29). In XI. 22-35 the Kulārnava dilates upon the etiquette to be observed in drinking wine as part of Kaula practice. It proceeds (V. 44 ) to divide flesh into three classes yiz of animals that fly in the sky (birds ), of acquatic animals and of those that move on the earth. The 1759 Svacchandatantra (& work of great authority in Kashmir Saivism) prescribea that various kinds of fish and meat and other food that can be licked and drunk should be poured in front of Siva (image) and one should not stint for money. Quotations from Pārānanda-sutra (notes 1698, 1703-4) make it perfectly clear that the words madya, māmse, and maithuna are employed therein in the ordinary Bense, Pārānandasūtra (on pp. 80-81, paragraphs 69-70 and pp. 82-83 para. 76-80) describes such obscene details of the sādhaka's sexual intercourse that it is not possible to set them down here. The ordinary worship of Dovl was elaborate enough, containing as it did 16 upacaras ( vide p. 164 note 420 above). Where was the necessity of bringing in wine, meat and maithuna as an absolutely necessary part of the worship of Dari? The Kulārnava and other tantras praise the Vedas, employ vedic mantras and quote1760 Upaniṣad and Gitā passages. Por example, Mahāpiryāṇa V.197 if employa Vedic mantras ( ag noted on p. 1058) for sanctifying the five makāras, the three mantras * Apo hi ṣthā' Rg. X. 9. 1-3 in Nāmakarana (ibid.

The Mabānirvāṇa (VIIL 214-215 ) proscribes Gita IV. 24 (brahmārpanam brahma havir) as the mantra to be recited by the leader of the Tattva. cakra in offering the five tattvas and in sanctifying them. In spite of all this lip service to the Veda the tantras ignore the great moral dangers involved in their persistent teaching of five makāras and also pay no hood to the impressive advice of the Gitā (III. 21) that whatever & great or honoured man does or holds as authoritative is followed by all common people. There are several late medieval works about the Kaula oult that speak of drinking wine, eating flesh and maithuna in the vulgar senge as means of Devi worship and yet assert that by doing so mukti (liberation) would be secured. Two verses from a ms of a tantrik work called Kaularahasya (containing one hundred Verses) will bring home to the reader how common people understood the cult of the makāras.1761 

Prof. Heinrich Zimmer in the Art of Indian Asia' (vol. I pp. 129-130) observes such living forms are suggested to the Indian artist by a dynamio philosophy that is intrinsic to his religious and philosophical tradition, for the worship of the life force pouring into the universe and maintaining it, mani. festing itself no less in the gross matter of daily experience than in the divine beings of religious vision constitutes the very foundation of Indian religious life. According to this doctrine which was particularly influential in the great periods of Indian art, release from the bondage of our normal human imperfection can be gained not only through the world nogating methods of asceticism (yoga) but equally through a perfect realization of love and its sexual enjoyment (bhoga). According to this view which has been eloquently expressed in the so-called Tantrio symbols and rituals of both the Hindu and Buddhist traditions, there is intrinsically no antagonism between yoga and bhoga. The role played by the guru, the spiritual guide and teacher in the stern masculine disciplines of yoga, is

taken over in the initiations of bhoga by the devout and sensual helpmate. The initiating women plays the part of Sakti while the male initiate assumes that of Śiva and both attain together to the realisation of the immanence within themselves of the consubstantiality of the Goddess and the God.' It has already been stated (p. 1054 ) that Prof. Zimmer is wrong in thinking that the Tāntrik rites were systematically disparaged as rāmamārga' by the Indian partisans of Yoga. He is also wrong (p. 130 ) when he says that 'throughout the first millenium A. D. they (Tantric rites ) were a basic element of normal Indian expert. enco.' There is really very little evidence to substantiate this claim. He makes this sweeping generalisation as an art-oritio and historian of Indian Art from the few tintrio sculptures on the Puri and other temples in Orissa and some other places in India. Vide the well-known work "Bengal Lancer' by F. Yeats-Brown (London, Golancz, 1930) pp. 23:-237, where the superintendent of the temple of Jagannātha justifies the obscene frescoes on the ground that until a man is master of his gross body he cannot see the Godhead and feels sure that future ages will look on Tāntrik psychology with understanding. 

One or two very peculiar notions and practices of the Tantrikas may be briefly mentioned here. The offering of flesh, wine and mudra to the devata with the recital of three bijas "ān, hrim, krom' and the mantras 'om Ananda bhairavāya Damah' and 'om Anandabhairavyai namah' was tochnically called suddhi 1762.

A most rovolting rite from the view-point of all unsophisti cated people is what is called 'oakra-pājā' (worship in a circle). An equal number of men and women without distinction of caste and even near blood relations secretly meet at night and sit in a oircle (vide Kaulāvallnirnaya VIII, 76). The Goddess is repre sented by a yantra (diagram). There is a leader of the cakra. The regulations were that only persons who had attained the status of Vira ( defined above in n 1763 ) were to be admitted 1764 and paśus (ordinary men with beastly passions not curbed) were to be excluded. What assurance was there that the leader of the cakra himself possessed the noble qualities mentioned in the vorse quoted above and would choose only men possessed of similar qualities ?

• History of Dhurmutāstra (Soc. VI, Ch. XXVI 

Śrioakra must have given rise to great obloquy and unpopu larity for the Tantrikas. Therefore, the Kulārpava 1765 adviser that cakrapūjā should be sub rosa, 'What happens at Srloakra, wbother good or bad, should never be uttered (in publio); this is the order (of God); one should never give out infor mation about what happens at Cakrapūjā'. The 18th century Mahānirvanatantra, which is reformist in character, states that, since in the Kali age (in which people are weak and the influence of sinful age is very strong ), for the last tattva (i. e. maithuna) one's own wife is alone to be the Sakti because in that case no fault can be found or some substitute like red sandalwood paste 'may be employed. In the author's youth whispers floated about that in some towns in Mahārāstra oakra. pūjā was practised, that even great Pandits thought that their learning was due to the favour of Devi, that they, though very orthodox in other respects, took once a year in Devipūja & thimbleful of wine as prasāda. The learned Achyutaraya 1766 Modak of Nasik composed at Nasik a work called 'Avaidika dhikkrti' (condemnation of non-vaidika practices) wherein he soverely handled the cult of the five makaras. 

Naturally common people, who could not appreciate or understand the abstruse and subtle philosophy of Sakti, Nada, Bindu and so forth, seized with avidity upon the apparently basy path of worship of Sakti by the five makāras and the mantras, bijas, cakras and the like taught by the Tantras and it has been seen above (pp. 1073–76 ) to what depths some persons professing to be gurus, Sāktas and Tantrikas descended in course of time. 

The path of the Tantras was in its higher level one of Upāsanā or Bhakti, though it very often degenerated into magio and moral depravity. The deity worshipped viz. Paramesvari

Three aspects of Devi 

1091 

presented three aspects to the upāsaka 1767 ( devotee) viz. gross (sthūla), subtle (sūkṣma) and para (highest). The first aspect is represented by the form of Devi with hands, feet and other limbs, which is fit for worship with the hands and the eyes of the devotee; the second aspect consists of mantras, which are fit for apprehension with the organs of hearing and speech by those who have the good fortune to receive the mantras from & worthy guru. The third aspect (para) is one to be apprehended by the mind of the sādhaka and described as all-poryading consciousness and the like (in Nityaṣodasika VI. 49-50 ). 

Some modern writers have beon somewhat unjust to the whole Tantrik literature in labelling it all as black magic or as full of obscenities. The present writer is not one of those who some times hold that what is not understood is either false, absurd or non-existent. He is prepared to believe that the end and aim of a few of the higher minds among Tāntrikas and of some of the works on Tantra was the attainment of high spiritual powers by Yoga practices, the Realization of the Supreme Tattva (Principle) variously designated as Brahma, Viṣnu, śiva or Dovi, and Liberation (mokṣa). He is aware that many of these claim to be based on Vedic traditions, teachings and practices and to have further developed the conceptions underlying Vedic teachings and ritual and that even the magio rites contained in Boveral Tantrik works had their counterparts, though on a much smaller scale, in the Rgveda, the Atharyaveda, Samavidbina Brāhmaṇa and other Vedic works. The present author, though he has carefully studied many of the Tantras and the Yogasutra of Patanjali with the bhāṣya and commentaries thereon, has to admit that he has had no mystic experience, but he is not pre pared to deny that prophets, saints, poets and others might have mystio visions and experiences.

and unknown as propounded in Alexis Carrell's work Man the unknown' and in 'Invisible influence' by Dr. Alexander Cannon (15th impression, Rider and Co., London, 1935). He knows that some of the Tantrik works made a distinction between the rules of ordinary social life and conventions (samājā-dharma ) and the peculiar forms of Tantrik worship, in which, while it lasts, no diatinction is made on the ground of caste Or Box (vide notes 1711 and 1713). It may further be conceded that the Tantra works placed women on a footing of equality with men, gave them an exalted position and that they endea voured to provide a common platform (as shown in n. 1704 above) for differing and wrangling sects of Vaisnavas, Saivas and others by putting forward Dovi as the object of worship for all; but they had not much success as is shown by the fact that Vaisnavas and Saivas still carried on their quarrels and that the Tāntrik texts themselves fell into five classes, viz. Saiva, Sakta, Vaisnava, Saura and Gāpapatya and that there are differing doctrines among the Tāntrikas called Kādimata, Hādimata &o. 

The matters that distinguish Tāntrik works from other religious literature in Sanskrit are the 1768 promise of the attain ment of miraculous powers, the Realization of the one Supreme Principle in & short time by means of the Tāntrik sādhanā " method or procedure (vide Intro. to 'Principles of Tantra' p. XIV), by their insistence on the worship of Devi with makāras alone as yielding the desired results (as in Maha. nirvāṇa V. 24 'paīcatattva-vibināyām pūjāyām na phalod 

1768, Sir Jobo Woodroffe remarks (in the latrodaction to his . Priaci ples of Tantra' part 2, pp. XII-XIV) that the one topic that appears to diferentiate Tantras from other religious works is the constitaent parts of its ritual such as the mantras, bijas, modrās, yantras, bhutasuddhi and that it is mainly by these items rather than by anything else that tho tāatrik character of a work is established. Vide also the Sāktas. by E. A, Payne p. 137 for a similar view. Sir, Jobo Woodroffe, while reviewing Payao's work (in JRAS for 1935 at p. 387), himself agreed that what distinguished the Sākta ritual is the maptra and magical sections and that part of it which deals with the secret ritual, that, while there is ordinarily do thoga (enjoyment) where there is yoga, in the Sākta doctrine a man may hava borb yoga and bhoga and that this is a distiact and profound characteristic of that doctrine. Even the Buddhist Vajrayapa Tantra porport to aim at the attaiament of bodhi (vide Gahyasamāja p. 154, Sadhanamālā I. p. 225 and II. P. 421) and ARE 14 \# T: HATGIT:

bhavah') and on their peculiar ritual of mantras, bijas (syllables meaningless to ordinary men), nyāgas, mudrās, cakras, yantras and similar things for attaining their goal. The condemnation poured on Tantricism is principally due to their insistence on wine, meat and sexual unions as the best and the only means for the effective worship of Devi, their theory that by merely repeating some mantra or mantras over wine, meat and other tattvas, by offering them to Devi and by medita tion on her, one may drink wine or eat meat, whon in the same breath they say emphatically that partaking of wine and meat is ainful without this ritual. This antagonizes those who are not kaulas and who hold that this persistent teaching is very dangerous for the common run of mon and savours of hypocrisy, 

Some of the Tantras practically inculcated what appears to non-tantrikas unbridled licence. The Kaulāvali-nirnaya (IV. 15 ff) asserts: "The Sāktas have no higher means of happi ness and liberation than the fifth tattva (i.e. maithuna ); & sādhaka becomes siddha only by the practice ) of the fifth tattve. If he resorts only to the first (i. e. wine ) he becomes only Bhairava, if only to the 2nd (meat) he becomes Brahmi, by the third (fish) he becomes & mahabhairava, by the 4th (mudra) he becomes foremost among sādhakan.179 The same Tantra goos further and frankly says 'all women are fit for intercourse to a (Sākta) worshipper except the wives of his guru or of those sāktas who have attained to the status of Vira, that for those who have reached the stage of advaja there is no prohibition por is anything enjoined. To the pure everything is pure, it is only the hankering that is blamable. In this con nection that work advances certain puerile and obscene argu ments (in VIII, 223-225) about illicit or incestuous intercourse that cannot be get out here. That tantra does not stand alone in suob statements. For example, the Kālivilāsatantra (X. 20-21) allows adulterous intercourse to a 'Sākta devotee pro

it. One who wanting wine for the purpura mind fixed (on 

vided it is not carried to the last stage of omission and avers that, if he observes the condition in the proviso, he would become the master of supernatural powers in spite of adultery. It should be noted that the author of this work has unabashed hardihood to make Siva tell this to Pārvati. About wine that work remarks just as drinking of soma 1770 ja prescribed for brahmapas is solemn Vedic sacrifices, similarly wine should be drunk at proper times (or according to the practice of Kaulas), since it confers enjoyment as well as mokṣa; drinking wine is blamable in the case of those who hanker after benefits or who are egoistic; but in the case of those that are free from egoista there is neither prohibition (of drinking) nor the enjoining of it. One who is free from the fetters of making distinctiona should practise drinking wine for the purpose of remembering the meaning of the mantras and for making his mind fixed on worship) but he who resorts to wine, and other tattvas merely for pleasure is sinful.' The teachings of works like the Kaula. yali-nirnays about drinking wine and sexual intercourse with all sorts of women as the highest means of Sakti worship by persons professing to be advaitins led to great depravity and sexual immorality and orgies as indicated by the criticism in medi eval works cited above (pp. 1073–76) that regarded Tantrik teach Inge as execrable, though some medieval Hindu works admitted into religious practices nyāga, mudrā, yantra and the like, which were deemed to be innocuous and which would be described in this work later on. The mere intention of doing good if certain conditions were fulfilled is not onongh excuse, when it is most likely that the means proposed for attaining & bigh spiritual level and for liberation would have the opposite effect on most people. Taking all things into consideration, the present author is constrained to observe that modieval and recent writers who loverely criticized Tantrik works were on the whole largely justified in their condemnation of Tantrik practices as enunciated in many Tāntrik worka and of the works themselves. For one man that attained super-normal powers, high spiritual level and great mystic experience there must have been hundreds of hypocrites, charlatans, and licentious mon who deluded frustful and ignorant med and particularly women.

Puranas and Tantrika practices 

1095; 

Only a few Purāṇas like the Devipurāṇa, the · Kalika, the Devimahatmya in the Markandega provide for the employment of some of the condemned makaras (madya, mārga, matsya) in the worship of the Great Goddess. From about the 6th or 7th century A.D. Puranas began to incorporate the special ceremonial characteristics of the Saktas and Tantrikas. Aparārka quotes a passage 177 from the Devipurāṇa wherein the qualifications of a Sthāpaka (one who performis Dovapratiṣthā) are set out, viz, he would be the best sthāpaka for establishing images of Devi and the Matrs, who knows the vāma (left or opposite ) and the dakṣiṇa (right) path of worship, who has thoroughly mastered the veda relating to the Mātrs (the Mother Goddesses), who is olever in the interpretation of Panoarātra works and is proficient in the Tantras of the Matrs &c. The Kālika-purāṇa devotes many chapters (54 ff) to the desoription of mantras, kavacas, mudrās, nyāsas &c. The Bhagavatapurāṇa also and Agni 1772 372.34 expressly say that the worship of gods and of Vignu also is either vaidiki, tāntriki or mitrā, the first and third being for the three higher varnas and the tantriki for sūdras. The Bhagavatapurāṇa refers to the worship of Keśava laid down in the Tantras for him who desires to cast out the knot (bondage or grief) of the heart, It (Bhagavata) also mentions 1773 Vaidiki and Tantriki dikṣā (in XI. 11. 37) and refers to the Tāntrik method of the angas, upāngas, Āyudhas and decorations in the worship of the Lord of Laksml. 1774 Some of the Purāpas and medieval nibandhas, however, fully utilized what Tantras bad to say about mantras, japa, nyāsa, mandala, cakra, yantra and

similar matters. This will be illustrated later by some examples. Even for such a simple and common topic as the 16 upaoiras of worship, the Varsakriya-kaumudi (p. 156) and Ekādasi-tattva (p. 59) quote the Prapañasāra-tantra (VI. 41-42).

Medhātithi or Manu says that the word mantra primarily means a part of the Veda comprising Rgveda, Yajurveda and Sānaveda, treated as such by those who have studied the Veda, and that expressions like "Agnaya svaba " 1776 employed in rites like Vaiśvadeva are called mantra. in a secondary sense by way of praise. The vedic conception was that a mantra bas great potency and that it must be correctly repeated to secure the desired result, that a mantra defective ad to accept or as to a letter or wrongly applied did not convey the meaning intended and that becoming a thunderbolt in the form of a word or words it destroys 1777 the yajamūna.

Classification of Vedic mantras

of four classes viz. Țk (which is metrical), yajus ( which has no restriction as to metre but which must be a sentence), & saman (which is sung) and nigada (i. o. praiga, meaning words that are addressed by one person to another calling upon the latter to do a certain act, e. g. the words 'srucaḥ sammrddhi, proksanir āsādaya'. Nigadas are yajus in form but are distinguished from yajus by the fact that the former are loudly uttered, while a yajus is ordinarily recited in a low voice.1978 The most sacred mantra is the Gāyatri (Rg. III, 62. 10 'tat-savitur' &c). The Atharvavada (XIX. 71.1) calls it Vedamātā (the mother of the Veda). The Bľahadāraṇyakopaniṣad (V. 14) contains a grand eulogy of the Gāyatri.1779 Om is a very sacred syllablo, & symbol of brahma and may be called in the language of the Tantras a bija. There are only a few syllables such as om, phat, vaṣat in the Vedic literature that on the face of them have no meaning but are like bija mantras in the Tantra sense. There is a Bijanighaṇķu (a dictionary of bija mantras ) printed in Tantrik texts' Vol. I, pp. 28–29 (where monosyllabic bijas such as Hrim, Srim, Krim, Hum, phat, are set out and described in symbolic words indicated in note 1708 above. It is stated about a dozen times in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa viz. it is the perfection of sacrifice when it is rūpasamddha ( perfect as to its form ) i, e. when the fk verse pointedly refers to the sacrificial act that is being performed. 1780 The Nirukta.(I. 15–16) starts a lengthy discussion on Kautsa's view that mantras have no sense (or are purposeless). There is a long discussion in the Pūrvamlmāmgāsūtra (I. 2. 31 ff) on the name lines 88 in the Nirukta. Jaimini states that there is no difference in the meanings of words employed in the Veda and those employed by people and Sabara adds in his bhāṣya (on P. M. S. I. 2. 32) that mantras are recited in sacrifices only for the purpose of conveying or manifesting the meaning.1781 It is difficult to

define what & vedic mantra is and it is generally understood, as said by Sabara, that passages or versos are mantras that are recognised as such by the learned. 1782 The whole Veda is divided into five categories viz. Vidhi (hortatory passages as in 'Agni hotram jubuyāt'), mantras, nūmadheya (names such as Udbhid in 'Udbhida yajeta' or Viśyajit' as in "Viśvajitā yajeta'), ni ṣedha (prohibition as in 'nānstam vadet') and artharāda (explanatory or laudatory pagaagos as in 'Vāyu is a deity that is swiftest'). The Nirukta ( 20 ) embodies the ancient view that the søges had an intuitive perception of Dharina and they transmitted the mantras by oral instruction to those that oame after them and that had no intuitive perception of Dharma. The mantras and stolras were supposed oven in the Rg. to induce the gods to come to the sacrifices and to bestow on those who recited them protection, valiant sons, cattle, wealth, victory and all sorts of things (e. g. vide Rg. I. 102. 1-5, II. 24. 15-16, II. 25. 2, III. 31. 14, IX. 20.7, IX. 72.9, X. 78. 8, X. 105. 1). It has beon shown above p. 920 ( in notes 4167-4168 ) how the Purāṇas prescribed their own mantras for many religious gots but those mantras also are significant and not meaningless. 

Mantras are the very heart and core of Tantraśāstra 80 much so that the sastra is often spoken of as mantragāstra. The theory of Tantrik writings such as the Prapancadāra and Sāradātilaka about mantras may be briefly stated as follows: In the human body there are ten nadis, the three principal being Idā (on the left side from the left testicle to the left nostril), Suṣumnā (in the middle of the body in the spinal chord) and Pingalā (on the right side from the right tosticle to the right nostril). The Kundalini lies asleep coiled like a snake in the Mūlādbāra-cakra. It is a form of the sabda-brahma. The Day! (or Sakti) assumes the form of Kundalini, all gods reside in Devi and all mantras are Her forms ( Śāradātilaka I. 55-57). It has already been stated how from contact with light (Jyotib ) Sakti becomes conscious and has a desire to create, then it . solidifies and appears as a bindu. Through the instrumentality

of Kala (Time) bindu divides itself into three, gross (i. e. bija ), subtle (sukemale. nada which is bijabindu) and para (i.s. bindu which is karyabindu). This last is of the nature of an unmanifest sound and is called sabdabrahma 17824 by the sagos (Saradatilaka I. 11-12. Prapeficasara I. 41 ff). Sabdabrahma exists in all things as consciousness; it exists in the bodies of living human beings in the form of Kundalini and then appears as letters in prose, poetry and so forth, being carried by Vayu (air) to the throat, palate, teeth &c. The sounds thus produced . are called akṣaras and when written they are spoken of as varnas (letters of the alphabet, matrka, which are 50 from a to ksa). The impulse to sound production arising in muladhara-cakra is called 'para.' (vak), it is called paśyanti when it reaches avādhiṣthāna-cakra, nadhyamā in the heart and vaikhari in the mouth. Both aksara and varṇa are Kundalini made articulate in speech and visible in writing. All the mantras (some say they are nine crores) are evolved from the varṇas of the alphabet that are deemed (by Tantrikas) to be living conscious sound powers. It is the bija mantras like hrim, śrim, krim that make visible the form of the Devata (Mahanirvana v. 18-19),1783 It is wrong to suppose that mantras are mere letters or words or language. They assume different forms, such as bija-mantras, kavaca, hrdaya &c. The bijamantras like Hrim (representing Tribhuvanośvari or Maya), Srim (representing Laksmi), Krim (representing Kali) cannot possibly be called language, since they convey no mean ing to ordinary men. They are the Devatā (Istadevatā of the

sādhaka, the worshipper) imparted to the sādhaka by the qualified guru at the time of dikai (initiation). They are not efficacious if merely learnt by reading books. Amantra accord ing to Tantrik works is the sound body of Sakti charged with the vibrations of the spiritual personality of the original Tantrika soor of the mantra and endowed with a perpetual store of power by the Tantrik seer. What is needed to awaken Power in the disciple and to reap the full effect of the mantra is the touch of the guru, the imagination and concentrated will power of the sādhaka. The deity willed that certain letters uttered by the seer should as aound or sounds convey such and such a meaning and should have a certain potency. The sounds represented by the letters are forms of Sivasakti i.e. $abdabrahma. From this last the whole world proceeds in the form of sounds (sabda ) and the objects (artha) which sounds or words denote. The Devatā, the mantra and the guru are the essentials of sūdhanā (procedure that leads on to Siddhi, laid down in Tantrik works); the disciple bas to revolve in his mind that the three are non-different. Mantra is not the same thing as a prayer. For a prayer & person may employ any words that he may choose, but in the case of a mantra definite letters are considered necessary, which are deemed to be the forms in which Sakti manifests Herself to the worshipper. A mantra may be in the form of words that have an obvious meaning or in the form of latters arranged in a particular order and that have no meaning to the uninitiated. It is recognised in some of the works on this sāstra that thought has creative power, that each person is Siva, and can attain to higher and higher spiritual levels depending upon his ability to realise himself as Śiva. Thoughts are real, kind thoughts will do good to ourselves and to those around us, evil thoughts and wishes of others may cause us suffering. 

Tāptrik works have their own inantras and they also employ Vodic mantras. For example, the mantra Jātavedase sunavāma' ( Rg. I, 99. 1), though addressed to Agai, is employed in later works for invoking Durgā, the mantra 'Tryambakam yajāmahe' (Rg. VII, 59, 12 ) is addressed to Rudra, but is called Mṛtyañjaya-mantra or mrtasanjivini mantra in Tantrik works and is prescribed for purifying the mind (cittasuddhi) in the Mahānirvana (VIII, 243). Similarly, the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III. 62. 10) is employed by the Tantrikas. Vide Sāradātilaka XXI. 1-8 

and 16 (latter for dhyāna of Gayatrl) and Prapanoasāra, wbiol.

derates the whole ohapter 30 to the explanation of om, the vyāhrtis and the words of the Gayatri and Gayatri-sadhana). The Mahānirvana prescribes the performance of Vaidiki sandhyā to be followed by the Tantriki sandhyā. The Tantriki Gāyatri is * Ādyāyal vidmahe Parameśvaryai dhimahi i tan-naḥ Kāli praco dayāti (Mahānirvāṇa V. 62-63). Even Śūdra Tantrikas were to recite this last, while the three higher classes were to repeat the vedic Gāyatri employing om, śrim and aim before it respec tively. The importance of guru, mantra and dovatā is emphati cally brought out in the following verse 'the person, who considers guru as a mere mortal, a mantra ag mere letters and images (of deities ) as mere stones falls into Hell.'1784 The Rudrayāmala says 'If Siva is angered, Guru can save ( the pupil), but if Guru is angered, no one can save (the pupil)'. 

The Parasurāmakalpasūtra, Jõānārṇavatantra, the Sāradās tilaka and almost all Tantrika works say that mantras possess wonderful and inconceivable powers, 1785 that a follower of Tantra secures all powers by following the practices of the school of his guru traditionally handed down and by faith, that mantras are the means of securing the fruits desired, that the authoritativeness of Tantraśāstra depends mainly on the faith of the followers of the sāstra; that the sādhaka should come to feel that guru, mantra, the deity, his own soul, mind and life breaths are all one and then he will possess the knowledge of the Highest Self. Some ot the Tantrik works contain most exag gerated praises of mantras, particularly the śrividyāmantra of sixteen letters; 0. g. Jñānārpaya says 'Even crores of Vajapoyas and thousands of Aśvamedhas are not equal ( in merit) to even the utterance of Srividyā and so also gifts of crores of Kapila COws cannot be compared to one utterance of frividyā (24th

Numberless mantras are contained in the Tantras made from different arrangements of the constituent parts of a mantra. The Mahānirvāpa first gives & mantra of ton syllables as noted below and then by different arrangements of the letters and by addition of certain other syllables and words like "Kalike' it forms twelve mantras, remarks that there are croros of mantras and that the mantras contained in all Tantras are all mantras of the Great 1785 Devi. 

The word mantra is explained as derived from 'man' to think and 'trai' or 'tra'. Yaska's Nirukta (VII. 12) derives it simply from 'man'. The Kularpava says 'mantra' is so called since it saves from all dangers, as the rādhaka thereby is led to ponder over God of immeasurable refulgence that is the only principle (in the world ). A similar derivation is given by Ramapūrva tapaniya Upanisad, by the Prapalicasara and other Tantras.1787 Numerous varieties of mantras called Kavaca, Hṣdaya, Upabr daya, Netra, Astra, Raksa and so forth are specified in the Tāatrik texts, one or two of which may be illustrated in the note below and the rest are passed over for reasons of space.1788 ____1786. The mantra of ten syllables in महानिर्वाण V. 10-13 is ड्रीं भी की परमेश्वरि स्वाहा. Then it proceeds : 'तव मन्त्रा हासंख्याताः कोटिकोट्यईदास्तथा।" येषु येषु च तन्त्रेषु ये ये मन्त्राः प्रकीर्तिताः। ते सर्व तव मन्त्राः स्युस्त्वमाचा प्रकतिर्यतः । महा निर्वाण V. 18-19.

Classification of mantras into male &c. 

1103 

The Sāradatilaka divides mantras into male, female and Deuter; masculine mantras end in 'hum' and 'phat', female mantras in 'svāhā' and neuter mantras end with 'namaḥ', This is stretched further so as to apply to letters viz. the vowels FF, ! I are said to be neither and the rest are said to be not neuter but only short and long (Śāradātilaka, VI. 3 and Rāghavabhatta thereon). Sāradātilaka (from chap. VII to XXII) is devoted to mantras of Sarasvati, Lakṣmi, Bhuva neśvari, Tvaritā and others, Durgā, 1789 Tripurā, Ganapati, Candran mas. Many of the mantras are to be repeated thousands of times or lakhs of times in order to secure full effect. For example, in X. 105-107 the Sāradātilaka prescribes that a certain mantra should be repeated five lakhs of times and then fifty thousand āhutis of ghee should be made and worship of the Devi with the procedure prescribed should be performed. The worshipper then BOCUNOS whatever he may desire and can make kings sub-servient to his will. Another noticeable feature is that the mantras are treated like the mantras of the Veda and mention is made in the manner of the Anukramanis of the eage, the metre, the deity and the viniyoga (or purpose for which it is to be used or employed). Though the Sāra dātilaka is a sober work free from the sexual practices of Vāmamārga, still it does contain mantras for magical purposes such as bringing women under control (IX. 103-104, X, 76), 1790 bringing about the paralysing or the death of an enemy by mantras ( XI. 60-124, XXI. 95 XXII, 1 ff).

aaserts that there is nothing that cannot be accomplished by mantras if proper procedure is followed. For example, it says that a certain mantra that is a prince among mantras conforg Buddhahood, what need is there to say about othere siddhis, that by another mantra even Buddhahood which is extremely difficult to attain is like a jujube fruit placed on the palm of the band and that a certain mantra ( of unmeaning worde) if repeated five times at three periods in the day viz. the morning, noon and evening, makes even a fool (lit. an ass) master of three handred works.

He offers different esoteric meanlags of the words of the mantra, e. g. op p. 130 he says 'om is the ascent towards universality, Hūm is the descent of the states of aniversality into the depth of the buman beart': on p. 131 'Om is the infinite, but Hum is the sofinite in the finite, the eternal in the temporal' &c.; on p. 230 'In the Om, we experi epce tbe Dharmakāya and the mystery of tbe upiversal body, in mani' the Sambhogakāya, in the Padma we experience the Nirmāṇakaya, ia the Hum we experience the Vajrakaya as synthesis of the transcendental body of tbe three mysteries; io the Hrih, we dedicate the totality of our transformed personality to the service of Amitabba; on p. 256 'thus Om.. Hum embodies the bappy tidings of liberation, of the love towarde all living beings and of the way that leads to figal realization. The present autbor is constraised to say that by similar arbitrary interpretations tbe words of any mantra may be mado to yield similar soppos.

p. 336 and No. 108. p. 221). Some of the mantras embody the doctrines of Mahāyāna with the addition of syllables like om, phat, svāha (such as 'om sūnyatā-jāānavajrasvabhava tmakoham' in Sadhanamālā vol. I. p. 62). The Prapanoasāra, which is ascribed to the great advaita teacher Saṅkarācārya and on which Padmapāda is said to have written a commentary (both published by A. Avalon in Tāntrik Texts, vol. XVIII-XIX, 1935), contains a mantra called Trailokya-mohana for the purpose 1793 of the six cruel magic rites and (in 34.33) describes & yantra (diagram ) by worship of which a sādhaka can make a woman smitten with passion for him and draw her to him, This, among other matters such as ungrammatical forms, raises grave doubts as to whether the work was really composed by the first Saṅkarācārya. It may, however, be stated that the learned Rāghavabhatta in many places in his commentary on the Sāradātilaka (such as I, 7, 8, 12) quotes the Prapancasāra ( I. 42, 44 ) as the great ācārya's work and several later writers do the same. It has to be borne in mind, however, that about 400 works are ascribed to the great advaita Acārya and that Rāghavabhatta was separated by at least seven centuries from the great Ācārya and his ascription therefore cannot be accepted with implicit faith without more evidence, 

Several Purāṇas are affected by the theory about the power of mantras of the Tantrika type. The Garuda-purāṇa (I. chap. 7 and 10) employs many monosyllabic unmeaning mantras like hrām, kṣaum, brim, hum, kuh, śrim, hrim and says (I, 23 ) that 

om Khakholkāya Sūryamurtayo namah' is the mūlamantra of the Sun and this mantra is employed for sun-worship in an early digest like the Kṛtyakalpataru od vrata (p. 9 note). The Bhavisya-purana (Brāhmaparva 215. 4) gives 'Khakholkāya namah' as the mūlamantra in Sun worship. The Bhavisya (Brāhma. 29. 9-15 ) provides that 'gam svāhā' is 'the mūla mantra of Ganapati worship, oites the mantras for hṣdaya, sikhā, kavaca &o. and a Gāyatri suited to Ganapati, 1794 Garuda I. 38 contains a long prose mantra of Cāmupdā.

purāṇa also contains many mantras of the Tantrik typo. Obap. 121 verses 15-17 provide 1795 for a mantra whereby enemeis are brought under control (as noted below) and versos 17-19 speak 

of a mantra for paralysing ( stambhand) of an enemy. Chap. 133–135 of the Agni contain several mantras of the Tantrik type. Chapter 307 contains several mantras of bringing under control the three worlds. 

A mantra called Mahāśvetā is spoken of in the Bhavisya purāṇa which is nientioned in the Krtyakalpataru on vrata (p. 9) and in Ekādaśitattva p. 40 and it is' brām hrim sah' and the japa of that mantra on Sunday with fast is said to yield what one desires. 1736 

The later medieval digests on Dharmaśāstra. adopt the Prānapratistha mantra erolved by the Sāradātilaka (XXIII, 71– 76). The Dorapratisthā tattva 1797 (pp. 506-507) quotes there verses from Saradātilaka, sets out the mantra and explains the versos at length. The Divyatattva also (pp. 609-610) does the same. The Vyavahāramayūkha (p. 86 ) sets out the same mantra for the consecration of the image of Dharma in the ordeal of Dharma without expressly naming the Sāradātilaka. The Nirnayasindhu (pp. 349-350 ) has an elaborate rite of the Prānapratisthā of images full of Tantrik elements like the words vaṣat, brim, and phat and employs the same procedure as the one prescribed by the Sāradātilaka without expressly mentioning the latter. The Sāradātilaka appears to follow earlier works like the Jayākhyasamhitā (Patala XX) and Prapaioasāra tantra ( 35. 1-9 ff).

• Contrast between Vedic and Tāntrik mantras 10% 

Reasons of space preolude further illustrations of the use of Tantrik mantras by medieval digests on Dharmasastra. One matter of contrast between Vedic mantras and some Tantrik mantras may be noticed. A Vedic mantra, according to Jaimini (I %. 32), was significant, but the Tantras go so far as to teach the repetition of mantras that have no meaning or that oontain the letters of the mantra in reversed form. For example, the Kālivilāsatantra (XXII. 21 ) says that the reverse of the three letters of the mantra 'om Durge', as 'rgedu om' yields all desires ('rgedu om tryakṣaram mantram Sarvakāmaphala- *. pradan)'. The Sad-dharmapundarika 1798 (a standard work of Mahāyāna Buddhism ) chap. 21 (text edited by Kern and Bunyiu Nanjiu, 1912 and translated in 8. B. E. vol. XXI. pp. 370-375) contains spells (called Dhāranipadāni). It should not be supposed that spells were peculiar to Hindus or Buddhists. Many ancient peoples believed that words and letters have magic power and that belief led on to another belief that it did not matter even if the letters and words had no sense. E. J. Thomas in ‘History of Buddhist thought' (reprint of 1953 ) states that spells similar to Hindu and Buddhist types exist in old English, Old High German and Keltic ( p. 186 ). 

The repetition of mantras, Vedic as well as Tantrik, is called 'Purascaraña ' 1799 (which literally means 'performing or carrying out before'). The Mehāniryāṇa (VII. 76-85 ) sets out Various modes of purasoarapa ( brief as well as elaborate). One way is to bring together five tattvas on the 14th tithi of a dark fortnight or on a Tuesday or Saturday, then the Devi is to be wor shipped and the worshipper is to repeat ten thousand timeg with single-mindedness the mantra in mahānisā (midnight), then he is to feed persons devoted to brahman and becomes one who has carried out purascaraña. Another way is that he should repeat every day one thousand times the mantra beginning on & Tuesday up to (including ) the next Tuesday, so that by repeating the mantra in al eight thousand times on eight days,

1799. Parascarana of a mantra bas several constituent elements viz. dhyāna (meditation on the form of the deity to be worshipped ), worship, japa of the mantra, homa, tarpana, abhisaka and feeding brahmanas. In a brief purascarana the first three alone are included. Tarpana means satiating with water the deity and the pitrs.

he will be deemed to have performed purasoarana. Sometimes." it is prescribed 1800 that a mantra such as 'Sivaya namah: (this is five-lettered mantra) or 'Om Sivaya namah' (a sadaksera mantra) should be repeated 24 lakhs of times and the sadhaka should offer into Agni twenty-four thousand ūlitis of pāyasas - Then the mantra becomes perfect and confers on the sadhaka whatever be desires. The Kulārpava states that Purasoarapa is so called because by the five-fold upīsınū the deity desired (as if) moves 1801 before the worshipper for conferring on him her favour. A mantra like the Gāyatri ig 1802 to be repeated every day 1008 or 108 or 10 times. This requirement is n: '. kooping with what the Purāṇas and Dharmaśāstra works say. For example, the Naradapurana (II. 57.54) provides thata mantra is to be repeated 8,28, or 108 times. The Ekadasitattva180m quotes Devipurāṇa for the proposition that the offerings in the home to planets should be 108. 28 or 8 according to one's ability. 

Raghavabhatta in his commentary on Saradatilaka (16.56) has a very exhaustive and learned note on the details of purascarapa that are common to all mantras. According to the Vayaviya-samhita 1833 the perfecting of the procedure of the mūlamantra is called purascarana, since it has to be practised before the acts in which it is to be employed. The Kulārpava 1894 provides that there are at least five constituent elements of purascaraṇa viz. pājā (worship of the desired deity) three times a day, japa (muttering of the mantra), tarpana, homa, and

Rāghavabhatta suggests another way of purascaraṇa viz, one should be pure, 1895 observe a fast and then in an eclipse of the sun or moon should stand in the navel-deep water of a river directly falling into the sea, should recite a mantra with concentration of mind from the time the eclipse begins till its end, thereafter perform homa and the rest in order reducing each to 1/10 of the number of jape recitation, then secure the guru's contentinent (by gifts) and that by this method mantra becomes perfect and the deity becomes favourable. The Kaulāvalinirpaya describes ( 14th patala, verses 75-260) a terrible sādhapā whereby in a single night a sādhaka socures mantra-siddhi yiz, by going to a cemetery or other lonely spot after one watch of the night, securing the corpse of a cāṇdāla, or of one who is killed by some one with a sword or one bitten by a snake or a young handsome warrior dying in a battle (not killed by himself), he should wash the corpse, offer worship to it and to Durgā and repeat the mantra ('om Durge Durge rakṣani svāhā'). If he is not frightened by the terrific sights that he may 89e and after following a very long procedure he secures mantrasiddhi. The Tārabhaktisudhārṇava (taranga IX pp 345 ff) describes the

worshipped, he would secure perfection of mantra even without : purasoaraṇa, that purascarapa is the main seed ( cause ) of (the . perfection of) mantras, that where the number of times & mantra. is to be recited is not expressly stated, it should be repeated 8000 times. Rāghavabhatta quotes a verse saying that just as a man in the grip of diseases is incapable of performing all actions a mantra devoid of purascaraṇa is declared to be in a similar condition. 

The Agnipurāna, Kulārpava and Sāradatilaka lay down rules about the places where purascarana of mantra is to be practised. The following places are commended 1807 for those who are engaged in porfecting a mantra, viz. holy places, river bank, caves, mountain top, ground near a tirtha, confluence of rivers, holy forests and parks, the root of a llva tree, mountain slopes, temple, seashore, one's own house or any place where the mind ( of the sādhaka ) feels happy. Rules were also laid down as to the food on which the sādhaka was to subsist during the days of purascarana viz. food 160% obtained by begging for alms (for brahmacūrin and yali), havisya food ( prescribed for yratas ), allowed vegetables, fruits, milk, bulbous roots, barley meal. The Mantramahodadhi ( 25. 66-71 ) sets out what is havisya food in śānti and proper food in the other cruel rites. Raghavabhatta (on 16.56 ) adds many rules from other sources, such as the sādhaka performing purascarapa should avoid sexual intercounte, flesh, wine, should not speak with women and sūdras, nor speak untruth, nor pamper his sengos, should carry on the japa from morning till noon, should not allow a break, should repeat the mantra the same number of times every day.

The Jayakhya-gamhita (19th patala, verses 13-33 ) says that, for three years after the sādhaka begins purascarada of the mantra chosen, various obstacles and disturbances present them selves but if his mind and action are not affected by them, then from the 4th year he comes to be served by disciples that gurrender everything to him, that after seven years even proud kings approach him for favour, after the 9th year he notices many wondrous things such as joy, sound dreams, sweet music and fragrance, 1809 hears loud vedic recitation, he eats and sleeps little (yet does not become loan), that these are signs of his having reached perfection in the mantra. The game work provides that such signs he should not divulge to any one but his own guru and if he divulges those happy signs to others siddhis run away from him ( 19. 34-37). The game Samhita (15. 186–188) provides that the syllables svābā, svādhā, phat, hum and namah are to be respectively employed in homa, in rites for manes, destructive activities, creating hatred among friends and for securing mokslo All tantrik works emphasize that mantra must be received from a qualified guru and the sādhanā of the mantra must be done under the guidance of the guru till the disciple himself becomes a siddha. As shown above it was believed that mantras would confer the highest spiritual and supernormal powers, would bring to the sādhaka all desired objects and mokṣa. The Kulārṇave states 1810 'It it deolared in the dootrine taught by Śiva that without dikṣā there would be no mokṣa, that diksa cannot be had without an ācārya ( guru) and that mantras would yield no fruit unless a guru instructs (a disciple ) about them'. 

1809. The Yogasūtra III. 36 and bhāsya thereon state that some of the powers developed are that the yoga expert hears divine music and receives the impression of fragrant scents. In 'Bengal Lancer' F. Yeats-Brown (London, 1930 ) narrates (pp. 246–247) how he had the experience that the room in which he and his American friends were sitting was filled by a yogic teacher who wore nothing but his dhoti with the perfame of attar of roses, then with the scent of violets, mask, sandalwood, with nothing else with him except cotton wool on which he focussed a magnifying glass. The Sv. Up. II, 13 details the first sigas of the effectiveness of yoga practices 'लवत्वमारोग्यमलोलपत्वं वर्णप्रसावः स्वरसौष्ठवं च । गन्धः शुभो मूत्रपुरीषमल्पं योगमवृचिं gurat tartallo,

It was further provided 1811 that there was no siddhi (miraculous powers due to mantras ) nor mokṣa for him who had not had diksa performed for him, that therefore a man should by all means receive dikṣā from & guru and that when one is endowed with the ceremony of dikṣā the distinctions based on caste vanish and a śūdra and a brābmana cease to be so ( when both have undergone dikṣā). It was held that, if a person were to engage in the japa of a mantra written in a book, he would not secure siddhi and he would surely meet losses at every 1812 step. 

In the Mabānirvana ( IL 14-15 and 20 ) it is said that Vedic mantras yielded desired results in Satya and other yugas, but in Kaliyuga they are like serpents without poison or like dead ones, that in the Kaliyuga the mantras declared in tantra works yield fruits quickly and are commended for employment in all actions such as japa and sacrifices. There is no such path as the one propounded in Tantras that would lead to nioksa or to happiness in this world and the next. The Mahānirvana prescribes that * om sac-cid-ekam brahma' is the best of mantras (III. 14), that those who perform the upisanā of the highest brahma are in need of no other sādhani and that by the mere perfection of that mantra the individual soul merges in brahma, 1813 80 Mokṣa was one of the aims. Another aim was the attainment of miraculous or supernormal powers. The Prapa casāra enume rates 1814 the eight siddhis and states that one who is endowed with these eight is a liberated soul and is apoken of as a yogin, The theory of siddhis is an ancient conception and occurs in the Apastamba-dharmasūtra. 1815 The eight siddhis are named and

explained in the Yogasūtrabhāsya as follows 1816: Animan ( becoming small like an atom, atomization), laghiman (levi tation), mahiman (becoming magnified like a mountain or the sky, magnification), prāpti (all objects becoming near to him such as touching the moon with one's fingertip, extension ), prākāmya (the non-obstruction of his desire such as diving into the earth underground and coming up as if he were in water), vaśitva (mastory of the five elements and their products such as a jar), iśitva (sovereignty over the prodaotion, absorption or arrangement of elements and their products ), yatra-kāmāyasi yitva (the power to determine things according to his wish or will i. e. be may will that poison should have the effect of nectar and brings about that result). A siddha would be one who has secured these eight siddhis. The Gita (X. 26 ) says that the sage Kapila is the great one among siddhas ('siddhānām kapilo muniḥ'). The Yogagātra further speaks of siddhis as fivefold viz. proceeding from birth, from drugs, from mantras, from tapas (austerities) and from concentration. There were other objects also sought to be achieved by mantras, such as the six cruel rites and making women to have passion for a man. This shows that not only Tāntrikas, but those who practised yoga believed in the power of mantras to confor supernormal powers on the yogin. The Yogasutra provides that some of the siddhis (as in II, 37 ) are obstacles to the attainment of samadhi and they are siddhis only to those who have awakened from trance, 1817 Yāj (III. 202-203) provides that the power to disappear, to enter another body and temporarily to abandon one's body, to create at one's will objects-these and other powers are characteristic signs of the attainment of siddhia by Yoga and that when one attains perfection in Yoga one can cast away the mortal coil and be able to become immortal in brahma 

A great deal is said about the six oruel rites in the Tantras such as Prapancasāra (V), Sāradātilaka (23. 121–145), Sakti. sangamatantra ( Kālikhaṇda VIII, 102–106), Mantramahodadhi ( 25th Taranga). The Sāradātilaka (23. 137–141) deals with the six methods or arrangements of mantra along with the name of the enemy against whom the six rites were to be practised,

Tin the arrangements called grathana, vidarbha, samputa, rodhana, yoga and pallava. These are all passed over here, But it appears that even the early Purāṇas were influenced by rites of black magio. For example, the Matsya 1818 says * in vidveṣana (creating enmity among friends or among those who love one another) and in abhicāra, a triangular kunda is recommended and homa should be offered in it by priests that weer red flowers and red sandalwood paste, that wear the sacred thread in the nivita way, that put on red turbans and red garments, the fuel sticks should be smeared with the fresh blood of crows collected in three vessels and should be offered with the left hand holding the bones of a bawk. The priests should have their hair untied on the head and should contemplate the befalling of evil on the enemy; they should recite the mantra durmitri yās-tasmai gantu' and also the syllables 'hrim' and 'phāt' and having recited over a razor the mantra used in syenayāga, the priest should cut into pieces an effigy of the enemy with that razor and throw into the fire the pieces of the effigy. This rite yields results only hore (in this world ), but no good results in the next world and therefore one ( who engages in this rite ) should then perform a śānti. The Matsya also provides for & rite for bringing a person (or a woman) under control or for uccātana ( chap. 93. 139–148). It is possible that the Tantrikas and the Matsya both developed their magic rites of six kinds from the Syenayāga mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas and Srauter sitras. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 138 ) also deals with those evil rites. The Ahirbudhnya-samhita, though mainly a work of the Pāācarātra cult, is full of lore on mantras 1819 In chap.52 (verses

2-88) it deals with the linguistic occultism of such mantras as 'om namo Viṣnave'. It says that mantras have three senses sthūla ( gross), sūkṣma (subtle ) and highest; chap. 51 explains these three about the Tara or Tāraka mantra viz. Om. 

It may be noted here that the Buddhist Tantras also claimed to show the way to the attainment of various objects, from success in love affairs to liberation and all these could be mostly secured by mantras. The Buddhist Tantra writers of the Vajrayāna school state that there were 84 siddhas, whose names are still cherished 1820 and honoured in Nepal and Tibet. : The Buddhists mentioned eight siddhis but they were somewhat different from those of the Yogasūtra. The Sadhanamala mentions them as follows: Khadga (a sword over which mantras have been muttered whereby the user of it succeeds in battle ). Añjana (collyrium applied to syos which enables a person to Bee buried treasure), Pādalepa (ointment applied to the soles of the feet enabling a person to move 'anywhere undis covered ), Antardhāna ( becoming invisible before the very eyes, of persons watching him ), Rasarasāyana (power of transo. mitting baser metals into gold or finding out an elixir for 

immortality), Khecara (being able to fly up in the sky), Bhūcara ( going swiftly anywhere on the earth ) and Pātālasiddhi (diving underneath the earth 1821). As the Buddhist monks were to possess no property, they had a craving for wealth and supposed that by means of certain mantras, the lord of wealth (Kubera) would confer on them riches that would last for over, 1822 They also believed that by mantras they would make

some of the Hindu gods their servants, viz. that they would be surrounded by many apsarases (heavenly damsels), that Indra would be their umbrella-bearer, Brahmā would be councillor and Hari door-keeper. 1823 They wanted to defeat opponents in public discussions and to acquire proficiency in Sāstras without study through the power of mantras alono (vide Sadhanamala Nos. 151, 155, 256 ). They were also anxious to cure and avert diseases and remove snake poison. They thought that by mantras they would attain to omniscience and Buddhahood (vide notes 1791-92 ). 

As stated above ( notes 1810-11) a mantra had to be received from a guru after initiation ( diksā ). Therefore, a fow words must be said about dikṣā. The Tantrikas did not discover any new concept in dikṣa. From very ancient Vedic times there Was upadayana regarded as the beginning of the spiritual birth of a boy and the sacrifices had to undergo a purifioatory ceremony before embarking on the performance of a sacrifice, but both were not so elaborate as the dikṣā described in some of the Tantrika works. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 1135-1140 for Vedic dikṣā (in Agnistoma ), the observanoes and references to the Brahmanas and the Srautasūtrag, The Tai. S. (VI. 1. 1-3 and VII. 4. 8) refers to diksā and the Ait. Br. (1 3) montions the main items in Vedic dikṣā, such as bath with sacred water on the sacrificer, smearing the face and other parts of the body with butter, applying collyrium to the eyes, purification of the sacrificer's body twice by the adhtaryu with three bunches of soven darbhas each above the navel and then below it with mantras, entering a pavilion specially prepared for the sacrificer, covering him with a garment that envelopes him as a sack envelopes an embryo, dark antelope skin as an upper garment, The Sat. Br. also refers to the details of dikṣā and states that thereby the sacrificer becomes one among the gods for the time being ( vide III. 1. 2. 10-21, III, 1, 3. 7-28) and for the idea that diksā symbolizes & now birth for the sacrificor. The Atharva veda says 'Great truth, formidable moral order, vows of initiation, austerities, prayer (or knowledge) and sacrifice support the earth, ' 1824

Treatment of Diksa 

1117 

Dikst is treated elaborately in some of the Tantras such as Prapancasāra ( V and VI), Kulārnava (14, 39 ff), Sāradātilaka ( 4th patala ), Nityotsava ( pp. 4-10), Jñānārpava ( 24th patala ), Visṇusambitā (X), Mahānirvāṇa (X. 112-119) and in Lingapurāṇa (II. 21). The Nirnaysāgara Press brought out an edition ( in 1935 ) of a work called Dikṣaprakāśikā of Viṣnu bhatta, pupil of Satyānandanātha, composed in saka 1719 ( 1797 A. D.). Almost all of them derive 1825 the word from the root. da' (to give ) and 'kṣi' to destroy, in various ways. The Kulārṇava defines it as 'the good call it dikṣā because it confers a divine (holy ) state and wipes off all sins, thereby freeing a man from the bondage of samsāra '; the Sāradātilaka states 

since it confers divine knowledge and destroys sins it is named dikṣā by the teachers that know the Tantras.'

The Saktisangama-tantra regards an eclipse of the sun or the moon ( particularly of the moon) as the best time for under going initiation for a mantra from & guru and remarks that when performed in an eclipse, the week day, tithi, nakṣatra or month or Yoga or Karana need not be considered. 1826 The Kālīvilāsatantra states that if one is fortunate enough to secure Svāti naksatra and Friday on the 5th tithi of the dark half of Phālguna and undergoes dikṣā on that date, that yields the rewards of a crore of ordinary dikṣās (VI. 3-4). The N. S. (p. 67 ) quotes the Jūānirnava to the effect that the dikṣā as to a mantra should be on the day of & solar or lunar eclipse or within seven days from an eclipse and adds that the principal time is solar eclipse and quotes Kālottara to the effect that, if the time of a solar eclipse is secured for dikṣā, ope need not consider the month, tithi, the week day and the like. N. 8. also quotes a passage from Yoginitantra condemning dikṣā on a lunar eclipse. Vide Muhūrtakalpadruma of Vitthala p. 94 verse 6 (Nirn. ed.) for further details about times and places for diksā:

History of Dharmalāstra (Soc. VI, Oh. XXVI 

The Agnipurāpa ( chapters 27, 81-89 and 304) deals with dikṣā at great length and is full of Tāntrik mantras and rites, but reasons of space forbid any treatment of the same here. The Jõānārpava (24. 45–53) provides that at the time of initiation (dikṣā ) the guru has to instruct the disciple or novice as regards the six cakras ( Ādbāra up to Ajñā) together with the number of petals in each, the colour of each, the letters of the alphabet assigned to each, 

Late Dharmaśāstra works relied for the initiation into mantras on tantra works. For example, the Dharmasindhu (p. 32 ) expressly says so. There is a difference between Diksā and upadeśa, which latter means the communication of only a mantra in a solar or lunar eclipse, at a tirtha, Siddhaksetra ( sacred region once inhabited by a siddha) or in a Siva templo. Raghupandana in Diksātattva (vol II. pp. 645-659) gives & lengthy treatment of dikṣā at the beginning of which he remarka that in the Sāradātilaka and other works numerous topics of dikṣā are described but as in his time all those were not being followed he attempts only a brief treatment. 

The Mabānirvāpa states (X. 201-202 ) that the guru for giving diksā when the disciple is a Sākta, Saiva, Vaispava, Saura or a Gāṇapatya, should be of the same sect, but a kaula is a good guru for every one. The Mabā nirvāṇa (X. 112) provides that a person does not become a Kaula by merely drinking wine, but he becomes so only after abhiseka. Then (in verses 113-193 of 10th ullāsa ) the Mahānirvāṇa provides an elaborate procedure of complete abhiseka somewhat resembling Christian Baptism. There is first on the day previous to the day of abhiṣoka worship of Ganesa, then of eight Saktis (Brahmi &c.), lokapālas and their weapons. Then the next day (i.e. the day of abhiseka ) after a bath the neophyte donates sesame and gold for the removal of all sins and approaches a guru with the prayer to perform abhiṣoka. Then the guru drawe & sarvatobhadra mandala on an altar, sanctifies the five tattvas, places an auspicious jar and fills it with wine or with holy water. The principal part consists in the guru's sprinkling with water the disciple to the accompaniment of 21 mantras (X. 160-180) invoking 1827 the gods Brahmā, Viṣnu, Siva, the Matre, various Śaktis, the avatārag, the numerous forms of Devi, the dikpalas,

the nine planeta, nakṣatras, yogas, weekdays, karañas, seas, sacred rivers, nāgas, treos &c. Then the guru gives the disciple a new name ending in Anandanātha, who honours the guru and other Kaulas present. This ceremony may go on for 9,7,5, 3 nights or one night. Vide Tantrarājatantra II. 58-7%, Jñana siddhi (XVII) for similar procedure of abhiseka. Vide the Introduction to the Sekoddesatikā, a Buddhist Tantrik work (in G.O.S.) edited by Mario E. Carelli, for its resemblance to the Christian rite of Baptism. The Ahirhudhnya-samhita (chap. 39) provides a procedure of Mahābhiṣeka as one comedy against all diseases, as one destroying all enemies and for the attainment of all desired objects. 

There were four kinds of dikṣas, Kriyavati, Varnamayi, Kalavatı and Vedhamayi and there were elaborate rules about vastuyāga, construction of mandapa, kuṇdas and sthandila, which are all passed over for reasons of space.
