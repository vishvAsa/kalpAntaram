CHAPTER XXXVI 

Fundamental and leading characteristics of Hindu 

culture and civilization 

It is necessary to gather together the threads scattered over six thousand pages of the History of Dharmaśāstra and to emphasize the fundamental and leading characteristics and conceptions of Hindu culture and civilization. 

The word Hindu ( in the form 'Hidu') appears to have been applied by the Persian2600 Emperors Darius ( 522-486 B.O.) and Xerxes ( 486-465 B. O.) to the territory and people to the west and to the east of the great river Sindhu, while the Greeks referred to the people in the same region as Indoi', from whioh comes the word 'Indian'. Herodotus in his History (Loeb series) states that the Thracians were the biggest nation in the world next to the Indians (Book 5 para 3, vol. III p.5) and that the Indians constituted the 20th province of the Persian Empire and paid 360 talents of gold dust as tribute. The word. Sindhu' occurs more than two hundred times in the Rgveda alone in the singular as well as in the plural The words 'Sindbavah' and * Sapta Sindhūn' occur more frequently than Sindhu in the singular. Indra is often desoribed as having let loose the seven Sindhus for flowing (Rg. I. 32.1%, II. 12.1%, IV. 28.1, VIL, 96.1, X, 43.3). In such passages what is meant is the great river Sindhu and its tributarios (or possibly its seven mouths ). 

2600. Vide the Naqkh-i-Rustam Inscription of Dāraya-ush (Darius ) and the Persepolis Tascription of Kshayārska (Xerxes) in 'Select loscriptions' edited by Dr. D. C. Sircar, No. 4 p. 10 god No. 9 p. 12. Sanskrit sa 'is changed to 'ba'even now lo some parts of our country, The ancient Parsi scripture Vendidad (S.B.E. Vol IV p, 2) mentions sixteen lands out of which aine can be identified, the 15th being Hapta Hlada (Sapta Sindhu).

Many passages of the Rgveda where the singular is employed refer to the river Bindhu alone (as in Rg. IL, 15.6, IV. 30.12, V. 4.9 &c). Io Rg. II, 15.6 it is said that Indra made Sindhu flow northwards. This would obviously refer to the first part of the river flowing northward from the Himalayas. Pāṇini usos the word Sindhu' as the name of a country in IV. 3.93 (Saindhava' means one who or whose ancestors lived in the Sindbu country). For the fluctuating limits of Aryāvarta, vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 11-16 and p. 1525, note 2483 above, where Rg. passages about Bharatas are set out and it is shown that the Purāpas speak of Bharata-varsa as of the same extent 

as that of modern India and the name is said to have been due ito Bharata, son of Duṣyanta and Sakuntala, Bharatavarṣa ocours 

in the Hathigumpha Inscription of Kbāravela ( line 10 on p. 79) which cannot be assigned to a date later than the 1st century2601 B. C. It has been shown above (p. 1016 n. 1649 ) that Asoka in one of his adiota refers to his kingdom as Jambudvipa. Even in those days in the rather long sankalpa ( declaration) at the beginning of & religious act in Mahārāṣtra, occur the words "Jambudvipe Bharatavarse Bauddhāvatāre Godāvaryā dakṣiṇa tire' &o. Therefore, the proper word to be used by us for our country should be Bharata varsa. It may be said that our culture and.civilization had throughout the past ages a geographical background. The Constitution of India has recognized this in its very first Article which runs India, that is Bharat, shall be & union of States'. In view of the fact, however, that the words * Hindu' and' Indian' have been employed for centuries by foreign as well as our own writers, this work will employ those words instead of ' Bharatavarga'. 

The words 'culture' and civilization' are used as syno nyms by some writers, while some others regard them as quite distinguishable. These two are defined in various ways by scholars. A few definitions are set out here by way of sample, 

Dr. Tyler states (in ‘Primitive Culture' vol. I p, 1, Murray, London, 1871) 'Culture or civilization is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and 

2601. Vide E, I, vol. XX pp. 71-89, Scholars differ about the data of this Inscription, Jayaswal holding (ibid, p. 77 ) that it belongs to the first half of the 2nd centary B, C., while N, N, Ghosh in J. G. J. R. I, vol. VI pp. 97-106 opines that it belongs to the last quarter of the first century B, C,

1615 

any other capabilities and habits acquired by man is a member of society', Mattbew Arnold's definition of culture in his lengthy essay on Culture and Anarchy' (1869, Prefaco p. VIII) is rather restricted in scope. Ele regards culture as a 'pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world, and through this knowledge turning a stream of fresh and free thought upon our stook notions and habits which we know follow ataunchly but mechanically, vainly imagining that there is & virtue in following them staunchly whioh makes up for the mischief of following them mechanically, Prof. P. A. Sorokin in Social and Cultural Dynamics' (1957, p.2) defines human culture as 'the sum total of everything which is created or modified by the conscious or unconscious activity of two or more individuals interacting with one another or condi tioning one another's behaviour.2612 Prof. Edgerton in Journal of American Oriental Society in a paper on the Dominant ideas in the formation of Indian Culture' (vol, 62 for 194% pp. 151–156) understands culture as a total way of life viewed as & Dorm and as such approved or at least tolerated by a people as a whole and by its articulate representatives generally. 

Prof. Toynbee in 'Cirilizations on trial' (1948) states (p. 223) 'I mean by a civilization the smallest unit of historical study at which one arrives when one tries to understand the history of his own country, U.S.A., gay, or U.K.' Prof. Toynbee in his latest work ' Reconsiderations' (vol. XII pp. 76–77, of his Study of History) adopts Bagbey's definition of culture as meaning regularities in the behaviour, internal and external, 

2602. Prof. Sorokio (ibid. pp. 24–25) distinguishes two types of integrated cultures, one called ideational and the other seasate. None of the two has, according to bim, ezisted in the porest form. In some culturas the first type prevails, in others the 2nd; while jo atill others both might miogle in equal proportions and on equal basis. This last he terms 

• idealistic type' (which is not to be confused with the ideational type ). Dr. G. S. Gburge's 'Culture and Society' (Upiversity of Bombay Publi. cations, 1947) is a very useful book on culture and civilization and con siders at longth the views of eminent writers like Emerson, Arnold, Morley, Whitehead, Russell, Laski, Wells and others. Prof. Northrop in 'Meeting of East and West' (1946) and Prof. Sorokin in Social Philosophies in ag age of crisis' (London, 1952 ) p. 145 hold that the total culture of a bation in the East or West is not a mora beap of numerons phenomong unrelatied to each otber but rather as grounded in differing philosophical conceptions of the nature of man and of the universe,

of the members of a Society, excluding those regularities which are clearly hereditary in origin' and adds that religious practices and institutions and, by implication, algo religious beliefs and experiences are certainly a part of oulture as thus defined' and mentions religion together with art, technology, social structure as examples of the elements of which culture consists ( pp. 84, 95). Prof. Toynbee further says that in his volumes he employed the word 'culture' in two different senses, viz. (1) the comprehensive one in which it is used by Bagby and (2) in an exclusive sense in which the word has been current in contemporary English since the time of Matthew Arnold ( ibidi. p. 272). As regards the word "civilization' be remarks (p. 273 ) that civilization is a hybrid word of modern French coinage and Johnson refused to include it in his dictionary. 

Archibald Robertson (in Rationalism in theory and practice', London, 1954 p. 62 ) says "when we use the word civilization', we mean & society with enough command over nature to raise it above savagery or barbarism. Civilization prima rily means'civitas'city life, division of labour and consequent surplus production over and above were animal needs.' Vide Prof. 8. Levi's book 'L'Inde et le Monde'p 63 translated in H. Kraemer's' World cultures and world religions'( London 1960 ) p. 315 where it is really a definition of Hindu civilization alone. 

It is unnecessary to cite further definitions. We may accept any one of these for a working hypothesis. If a distinction is to be made between the two words, one may say that the word 'culture', being neutral in meaning, is the better one to use than the word 'civilization'. The latter word is often employed for an advanced stage of social development and is contrasted with the stage of primitive or barbarian societies. People often speak of primitive culture, but rarely, if at all, of primitive civilization, 

During the last 6000 years of human history, several cultures and civilizations rose and fell. Spengler, a militarist and anti-rationalistio author, who does not rely on religion, morality or politics but is a votary of force, examines about thirty civilizations and cultures and propounds the thesis that all of them (except seven or eight) follow & certain common pattern, viz. they are born, grow, decline and die and that once defunct they are not revived. Prof. Toynbee, a Christian ( and 

Toynbee on Indian culture criticized 

1617 

not a militarist) in his 'Study of History' appears to arrive at conclusions not unlike those of Spengler, viz, culture and societies have stages of childhood, maturity, senility and disintegration. On p. 758 of Volume IX of his 'Study of History' he gives a table for nineteen civilizations with the dates of their Epiphany (manifestation), of their breakdown and the span of growth phasa in number of years. He puts down Indic civilization as starting in 1375 B.C. and as breaking down in 725 B. C. and Hindu civilization as beginning in 775 A. D. and its breakdown in 1175 A. D. This is, to say the least, most objectionable.2603 The distinction between Indic and Hindu civilization is arbitrary and the dates also are so. Why the Hindu civilization is held by him as breaking down in 1175 A. D. is quite unconvincing and what was the nature or name of India's civilization between 725 B. O. and 775 A. D. is not stated by him. On the other hand, the whole metaphor of being born, growing, maturing and disintegrating is held inapplicable to civilizations by other distinguished writers, such as J. G. De Beus in the 'Future of the Wast' (London, 1953), who remarks that civilizations are not born and they do not die (p. 60 ), but are transformed or absorbed. Prof. Sorokin asserts (in 'Social and Cultural Dynamica") that his theory has little in common with the age-old theories of the life cycle of culture and societies with stages of childhood, maturity, senility and decay (p. 627). Leonard Woolf in 

Quack, quack' mercilessly critioizes Spengler's theories (pp. 139-160). A. L. Kroeber in Style and Civilizations' (New York, 1957 ) agrees with Prof. Sorokid and disagrees with Spengler and Toynbee and remarks that 'the study of civili zations oan hardly become truly scientific or scholarly until it divests itself of emotional concern about crisis, decay, collapse, extinotion and doom' (p. 160). 

Among the numerous civilizations and cultures that flourished in the world there are only two (namely, the Indian and the Chinese ) that have survived and kept up a continuity of tradition for four thousand years (if not more ) in spite of recurrent invasions by foreign hordes like those by Persians, 

2603, While these pages were passing through the press, I received Prof. Toynbee's Reconsiderations' (Vol. XII of bis Study of History ) on p. 184 of which be revises his opinion by saying " the maintenance of the brahmans' monopoly of the religious ministry gires Indian History a continuity throughout the period ranging from the Aryan javasion to the impact of the West",

Greeks, Scythians, Huna, Turks and notwithstanding internal conflicts and convulsions.2004 India absorbed guoh people and made many Greeks, Sakas and other foreigners adopt the spiritual ideologies of India and found for them a place in the Indian social fabric ( as has been and will be shown later). Not only so, India could spread its literature, religion, art and culture, not by invasions or annexations but mostly by peaceful means, viz. teaching, translations of Sanskrit works and persuasion, to Ceylon, Burma, Sumatra, Malaya, Java, Bali, Borneo, China, Tibet, Japan, Mongolia and Corea.26*5 The charming island of Bali is still Hindu with four varnas, priests being called Pedanda (Pandita), consecrated water for worship being called Toya (vide S. Levi's 'Sanskrit texts from Bali' Preface p. XII G.O.S.), priests still repeating one quarter of Gāyatri, viz. 'bhargo depasya dhimahi' (ibid. p. XV) and repeating the yajñopavita mantra (yajñopavitam paramam etc.) in & corrupt form, 

This persistence of Indian culture and civilization for Beveral millennia requires an explanation and a consideration of the fundamental conceptions, values and characteristics of that civilization would enable us to offer a satisfactory one Indian culture and civilization have a distinct personality and should not and could not be judged by purely European standards.

Bagchi (Hind Kitabs, 1950), particularly chapters II and III.Conceit of nations about their Mission 

1619 

Various peoples during past centuries had the conooit that they were far superior to others and had a mission to propagate. When the British empire became so extensive that the Sun never set on it', many British imperialists olaimed (most hypo oritioally) that they were carrying on the white man's burden 2605 A for the benefit and betterment of undeveloped and backward people ( when British Imperialism was impoverishing 

to the utmost the people whom they governed by their colonial policies as will be briefly indicated later on so far as India is concerned). Russia claims that it has the mission to liberate the proletariat from capitalism and to bring about a Paradise on Earth, The Germans under Hitler believed that they belonged to the superior Nordic race and that they would save the world from communism. Such a conceit is not confined to the West. The Chinese believed that they alone were civilized. The Japanese hold that their Emperor is the son of Heaven. In these days some Indians also claim that spirituality existed nowhere except in India. It is quite correct to say that ancient Indian culture and civilization were based on great spiritual values. It would be entirely in the wrong to say that other people had no spirituality. All that we can at most say is that spirituality is more basic to Hinduism and was more diffused among Hindu people than anywhere else. The Manusmṛti provides that only those usages of varpas and mixed castes that are traditionally prevalent in the country of Brahmāvarta, in Kurukṣetra, in the countries of Matsya, Pañoala (the country called Doab) and Sūrasena (round about Mathurā) are spoken of as sadācāra (II, 17–19) and that all men on the earth should learn their respective duties from brāhmaṇas born in those countries. The Manusmrti exoludes the countries of Madhyadeśa (as defined by it) and Aryāvarta from this provision (II 21–). Recently, some people appear to rely on the words 'kļṇvanto visvam-aryam' occurring in Rg. IX. 63. 5-6 and hold that the Veda has put forward the mission of our country as making the whole world arya. But there is hardly any foundation for this conceit. These words ooour about the offering of Soma juice (indavah) to Indra. They only mean this-these Soma libations, brown in colour, 2506 (prossed from Soma plant) increase (the

might of) Indra, making the waters to fall (from the sky ). destroy hostile men coming to Indra, making all the whole environment ) noble they reach their proper sphere.' There is here no reference whaterer to Vedic people making the whole world Ārya. At the most these verses may be interpreted as suggesting that Soma sacrifices to Indra would make the world Arya. Then there is no message in it which modern Indians can give and spread. Soua plant itself became unavailable in Vedic times and substitutes had to be utilized. And hardly any Bolemn Vedic sacrifices have been performed for centuries in India and very rarely, if at all, Soma sacrifices. 

During the last four or five hundred years the Western pations professing Christianity started on a career of conquest, exploitation of undeveloped countries and peoples, colonial empires, use of the discoveries of science for competitivo pur poses, the amassing of wealth with such ideologies as those expressed in the words everybody should be for himself and the devil take the hind-most.' But the devastation and atrocities of the last two world wars and the possibility of the annihilation of the human race or a very large part of it by atomic warfare have now opened the eyes of many thoughtful leaders and people in the West that, if modern civilization is to be saved, they must cultivate regard for spiritual values, love of righteousness and justice, sympathy with the oppressed, and active belief in the brotherhood of man. Though our ancient sages and lawgi vers laid great emphasis on spiritul values, & very large majority of our people and so-called leaders have been wanting in the practice of those values for centuries. Instead of merely praising our past glories, the prosent author would humbly request all educated Indians to be introspective and to ponder over cortain questions that are often asked and seek to find the reasons for the loss of our freedom from the 13th century onwards. (1) Why Hindus were generally found inferior to the invaders, Persian, Greek, Scythian, Turk, English, even though Indians far outnumbered and even though most invaders were impressed by the courage and perfect indifference to death on the part of India's soldiers; (2) Why Hindus could not form

& permanent organized State comprising the whole of India for many centuries; (3) why did they fail to take advantage of the splendid natural resources of India to excel in manufactures, commerce and industry. We must enter upon a thoroughgoing and honest inquiry into our past to find our own defects (political and others ) that led to our fall for centuries and try to remove those defects as quiokly as possible, now that Bhārata has won independence after centuries. There was no political unity of the whole of India till the British began to rule over the whole of India. There were constant wars among Hindu kingdoms and princes. For example, because the Marathas invaded Bengal, the Bengalis hated Marathas and were jubilant Over the defeat of the Marathas by the British. We Indians hardly had any deep-seated feeling of all Indians being one people or of nationalism till the 2nd half of the 19th century A. D. This chapter cannot discuss at length the subject of the causes of the downfall of India, politically and in other respects. But a few remarks would not be altogether out of place here. 

Hinduism is a combination of many systems and religious ideologies including Vedic ritualism, Vedāntic thought, Vaiṣṇayism, Saivism, Shāktism and primeval cults, adapted to the requirements of different types of men and communities with great disparities of intellectual and spiritual attainments. There were only a few matters that would be said to have bound most of the Hindus to each other, viz. the doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma, the unifying influence of the vast and venerated Sanskrit literature that gradually enriched the regional langu ages, the veneration in which the Vedas were held by all Hindus as the final authority in religious matters, though only a small minority could learn and understand them, the geogra phical unity of the country from the Himalaya to Cape Comorin emphasized by the Purāṇas and by the pilgrimages to holy places from Mānaga lake and Badrinath to Rameśvara. These few elements, however, were not enough to neutralize the causes that militated against effective unity amongst all Hindus. Most of the acāryas and saints laid too much emphasis on other worldiness and Vedanta and did not lay equal or greater emphasis on or recognize the importance of active and thorough performance of people's duties to themselves, to their families, and to society, the result being that many people, whether fit or unfit, tried to become otherworldly and did not actively pursue worldly values with righteousness. Another cause of disunity 

1622 



[seo. X, Oh. XXXVI 

and downfall was the great disparity between the high meta physical teaching of the whole world being one and the treatment meted out to lower classes and untouchables, owing to ideas of exclusiveness, of purity and pollution by touch &o. The education of the masses was greatly neglected2607 and the bigher classes did not seriously mind who ruled the country as long as their life was not much disturbed. The great patriot and revolu tionary Savarkar, hammered on seven fetters by which Hindu society wag bound for conturies, viz. untouchability, prohibitions of several kinds viz. soa travel, of mutual dining among the hundreds of castes and subcastes, of intercaste marriages, of Veda study against several castes, prohibition against following certain occupations and prohibition against re-admission to Hinduism of people that were converted to other religious faiths by force, fraud or ignorance. 

Our cultural bistory shows some central features which may be mentioned in one place here. The first is that there has been an unbroken religious tradition from the Vedic times almost to the present day. Vedic mantras are still employed throughout the whole of India in religious rites and ceremonies by all brāhmaṇas and by a large number of the members of castes claiming to be Ksatriyas and Vaisyas. The Vedic gods are not entirely forgotten. Kindling of Agoi is still required at the beginning of all rites; Viṣṇu (though not so frequently praised as Indra, Agni or Varuṇa, yet often enough, is praised in Rg. I. 22 . 16-21, I. 154. 1-6, I. 155. 1-6, VI. 69. 1-8, both Indra and Viṣnu are praised in Rg. VII. 99. 1-7, Atharvaveda VII. 27.4-9 ) and Siva (Rudra of the Rgveda, transformed a great deal yet highly praised in Rg. II. 1.6, II, 33,9, X. 92.9 where he is spoken of as Siva) are even now the principal deities worshipped. In the morning and evening Sandhyā worship, brāhmaṇas in many parts of India still repeat respectively verses addressed to Mitra (Rg. III. 59 ) and Varupa (Rg. I. 25 ). The second feature is that, India being a vast country (as large as the whole of Europe minus Russia ), central authority in political power never existed (except perhaps for a short time under Asoka). The ideal was that of supreme ruler ( samrāt or cakravartin). But, if & king submitted, acknowledged the prowess of the successful conqueror 

2607. Vide Works of Vivekananda (Mayavati ed. Vol. III. pp. 191-192, 428–29, V. 122, VI, 224). The census of 1951 disclosed that there were fifty-one million untouchables lo Bbārata,

and paid some tribute, no sarrat troubled himself to look into tho affairs of the kingdoms ruled by petty kings. There could, therefore, be no common front against a foreign invader, no uniformity in laws, customs and practices and there were frequent wars among kings and petty princes. A third feature was that there did not develop a serious clash of cultures, there was tolerance about varying ideologies and beliefs and constant adaptation to create harmony in diversity. 

It makes one sad to find that not a single Hindu scholar resembling Alberuni came forward to inquire into the causes of the successful invasions of India by Mahmud of Gazni and later hordes. Intellectuals were mostly engaged at least from the 11th century onwards in composing works of thousands of pages on such topics as Vrata, Dāna, Srāddha ( as the very learned minister Hemādri did) or in mental gymnastics about logic, Vedānta, Poetics and similar subjects and appear to have bestowed little thought on finding means of meeting the onslaught of foreignons or the remedies for removing their own weaknesses and defects. There were also other causes of the downfall of Hindus. Our intellectuals did not or could not pursue and make their own discoveries of science and technology made in the world from the 15th century A. D. Shahaji purchased firearms from foreigners. Neither he, nor his great son Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha empire, started factories for the manufacture of up-to-date firearms and cannon. Similarly, our people did not properly appreciate the role of a powerful navy. If the Hindus or their rulers had possessed a powerful navy they would have been able to nip in the bud the ambitions of the Portuguese, the French and the English, 

We must now get out the important characteristics of Hindu culture and civilization. 

1. The most striking conception even as early as the Rgveda is that there is only one Reality or Essence, in spite of the fact that people speak of it or worship it as Indra, Mitra, Vartiṇa, Agni &o. ( Rg. I. 164. 46, VIII. 58. 1, X. 129. 2. q. above on p. 1487). In the Mahābhārata, Purāṇas, in classical Sanskrit Poetry and even in medieval times, when there were various aults and schisms, such as the worship of Viṣṇu or Siva or Sakti, almost all Hindus had an inner consciousness that God is one though oalled by various names; vide p. 118 note 306, p. 973 and note 1593 above, and Harivansa (Viṇṇuparva 23. 31 ), Kumāra Bambhava VII, 44.

[Seo.X,ChxxxVI 

2. From this conception arose the great tolerance that Hinduism at all times showed to freedom of thought and worship, which has been dwelt upon by the present author in H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 388 note 928, Vol. V. pp. 970-71, 1011-1018 (references to Asoka's edicts and Yaj. I. 343 and numerous instances of Indian kings and donors of one persuasion making gifts to temples and institutions of other cults and persuasions ); vide also Gitā 7. 21-22 and 9.23. To hunt down heretics, real or supposed, has been a favourite business of some religiong3603 for centuries. This has been absent from Hinduism. Hindusim is not bound by any fixed creed nor does it rely on a single book2608 or a prophet as its founder. All that it requires is that man shoud be God-fearing and what matters is not correct beliefs but moral conduct and social behaviour. Hindus do not deny the truth of any religion or reject the validity of another man's religious experience. A verse2609 quoted below breathes a broad-minded approach to religious beliefs and worship 'May Hari, the Lord of the three worlds, bestow on you the desired reward, whom the Saivas worship as Siva, Vedāntins as brahman, the Bauddhas as Buddha, the Naiyāykas proficient in the means of knowledge as the Creator, those devoted to Jain teachings as Arbat and Mimāṁsakas as Yajña'. The great logician Udayana who composed his Lakṣaṇāvali in saka 906 (984 A. D.) breathes in his Nyayakusumanjali the same spirit as is contained in the verse translated above. Tolerance is thus of the essence of Hinduism and even an atheist is often met with amusement and not with persecution. 

III. Working on the doctrine that there is only one Essence or Godhead, the sages of the Upaniṣads arrived at the

Vedānta doctrine of one in the many and many in one 1625 

conclusion that the individual self is non-different from the one Essence, that all manifoldness is only apparent, that even fishermen, slaves, gamblers and the inanimate world are non-different from it. This Vedānta doctrine is one of the most characteristic features of Hinduism and is India's great contribution to the spiritual development of man, though there are sporadic instances of this doctrine having been held by some ancient philosopbers in other lands. This idea of one in the many and many in one is the very core or centre of Vedānta. This has been dealt with above ( vide pp. 1499-1500 notes 2451-52 and pp. 1509-10). In Europe the study of philo sophy is an end in itself. In ancient India this idea of the unity in diversity was made the basis of education and sociology and it was held that the realization of this unity in one's life was the highest freedom (mokṣa). 

The Upaniṣadic teaching is a universal doctrine in which all men of good will can meet and combine, in whatever religion they might have been brought up from their childhood. Many illustrations are adduced in the Upaniṣads to bring home non-difference to the inquirer about the Essence. But two are very apt. The Mundaka Upaniṣad ( III, 2.8) declares "just as rivers flowing ( towards the ocean) become morged in the ocean after giving up their names and forms, so the man who realizes (knows ), being free from name and form, attains the divine Person that is higher than the highest". The Praśnopaniṣad has (VI.5) the same illustration in prose. The Kathopaniṣad IV. 15 states * just as pure water poured into pure water assumes the same form ( appearance ), similarly the soul of the sage who has realized (the Essence ) becomes the Atman (Self). Deussen in his address on 20th February 1893 before the Asiatic Society of Bombay (in J. B. B. R. A. S. No. 18 for 1893 Art 20 pp. 330-340) after quoting the verge of Mundaka III, 2. 8 remarks “It is not the falling of the drops in the infinite ocean, it is the whole ocean returning to that which he really is and has never ceased to be, to his own all-pervading eternal almighty nature" and concludes (p. 340) “ Vedānta in its unfalsified form is the strongest support for morality, is the greatest consolation in the sufferings of life and death; Indians, keep to it," Vide V.S. II. 3.43, where reference is made to Atharvaveda 'Brahma daśā brahma dāsa brahmeme kitavā uta' ( occurring in the Paippalada version as shown by Prof. Durgāmohan Bhattacharya in his paper on a

IV. From very ancient Vedic times one of the fundamental conceptions of our Indian culture has been the idea of three spiritual and religious debts owed by a person to the sages, gods and pits, which he paid off by the study of the ancient lore, by sacrifices, and by having a son or sons respectively. This subject has been dealt with at length in the H, of Dh. Vol. II pp. 270, 425, 560-61, 676, Vol. VII p. 416 and above. p. 1318 note 2168. To these three debts the Mabābhārata added a fourth viz. the debt owed to all men:paid off by goodness (vide H. of Dh. Vol. III p. 416 1. 675 ). Sabara on Jaimini VI, 2.31 explains that this doctrine is not confined to brāhnianas but to all members of the three classes, the word 'brāhmana' used in the Tai. S. and other Vedic texts being only illustrative. 

V. Another set of values is contained in the conception of puruṣārthas ( ends or goals of human endeavour) viz. Dharma (right conduct), Artha ( economics, politics and civics ), Kama (life of sex, of pleasures and aesthetics ), Moksa (salvation, release or recovery by the self of its real nature and freedom from the bondage of low desires and aims). Mokṣa is said to be the highest goal (parauapuruṣārtha) and the first three are spoken of as 'trivarga'. The concept of Dharma is a far-reaching one and has been emphasized from very ancient times and refers to the principles which men have to observe in their lives and in social relations. This subject of puruṣarthas and of dharna has been dealt with at some length in H. of Dk. Vol. 1 pp. 2-11 and Vol. III pp. 8-10 and 239-241. Therefore, only a few matters would be briefly emphasized here. It has been shown above on pp. 1-21 how the Rgveda had three words viz. gla (cosmic order), vrata (laws or ordinances deemed to be laid down by a god or gods) and dharma (religious rites or sacrificos or fixed principles), how gradually rta receded into the back ground and 'satya' took its place and Dharma became an all-embracing conception and vrata came to be restricted to sacred vows and rules of conduct. When a teacher was about to take leave of the pupil at the end of the latter's studenthood he placed in his final exhortation (Tai. Up. I. 11 ) Truth as the first and Dharma as next to it (satyam yada dharmam cara ). The Bș. Up. 1. 4. 14 equates Satya with Dharma. One of the noblest prayers occurs in the Bṭ. Up. (I. 3. 28 ) 'from falsehood lead me unto truth, from darkness unto light, from death 

Noble prayers and virtues emphasized in Upaniṣads 1627 unto life eternal'. The same Upaniṣad in V. 2. 3 inculcates on all men the three cardinal virtues of self-restraint ( dama), charity ( dāna) and compassion ( dayā). The Ohān. Up. V. 10 quotes a verse' the thief stealing gold, the drinker of liquor, one who dishonours his guru's bed and the murderer of a brāhmaṇa-- these four fall ( into hell ) and the fifth is one who associates with them.' It would be noticed that this anoient verse contains some of the ten commandments of the Bible. In spite of these ) (noble Upanisadia teachings of Dharma and morality, Prof. Keith ( in 'Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upaniṣads ', Vol. II. p. 584, ed. of 1925) makes the pontifical but peryonse pro nouncement that' the ethical content of the Upanigads is negligible and valueless. It is not necessary to combat here his views. Most scholars would rather follow Schopenhauer (quoted in S. B. E. Vol. I, p. LXI) and Deusson (quoted above in Vol. II. p. 424 ) rather than Keith. The concept of Dharma began to occupy the highest position in the times of the Upanisads. The Bṭ. Up. I. 4.14 states there is nothing higher than Dharma.' The Tai,2610 Āranyaka avers 'Dharma is the support (or prop) of the whole world'. The Mahabhārata and Manu repeatedly refer to the high value of Dharma. The Mahābhārata claims that everything concerning the four puruṣārthas is contained in it and that what is not contained in it about them would be found in no other work. In Udyogaparva it is stated 'Dharma is so called because of its character as the sustainer of all beings.' Vanaparve and Manu both declare Dharma when violated kills the violator, when preserved it preserves man; therefore, Dharma should not be violated lest Dharma might destroy us.' Vyāsa winds up the Mahābhārata with the solemn appeal with arms up-raised 1 here raise a loud cry, but no one listens to me; from Dharma spring wealth and satisfaction of all desires, why is Dharma not resorted to ? One should not give up Dharma for some desired object, nor through foar nor from greed nor even for the

sake of life itself. Dharma is eternal, pleasure and pain are impermanent, the individual self is eternal, but the conditions (under which self works ) are impermanent.' The Mahābhāra ta passages quoted in n. 18 p. 8 of H. of Dh. Vol. II say the three ( Dharma, Artha, Kama ) are meant for all men, that Dharma is the best of the three, that Artha is middling and Kāma is the lowest and that if there be conflict then Dharma must be followed and the other two abandoned.' This shows that Artha and Kāma were made subservient to Dharma ( the ethical code ) and all three were subservient to the spiritual goal. Our Sāstras do not at all prescribe asceticism for all, but they recognized a scale of values. The Manusmrti (IV.3 and 15 ) provides' one should accumulate wealth for securing only his needs by actions proper for his station ( varna &c) and without harm to his body. One should not desire to acquire wealth by excessive attachment nor by actions condemned by Śāstra nor when be has already enough wealth nor from any kind of person (a sinner or like ), even when he is in straightened circumstances. Āp. Dh. S. (II. 8. 20 22-23) declares that man should enjoy all such pleasures as are not against Dharma; by doing 80 be secures both worlds ( this life and life in the next world ). Gautama Dharmagūtra3611 IX. 46-47 and Yāj. I. 115 practically say the same thing. In the Bhagavadgitā (VII. 11 ) Kispa identifier himself with Kāma that is not in conflict with Dharma. The Arthasāstra of Kautilya no doubt says (I. 7) that. Artha is the chief among the three puruṣārthas', but he also provides that one should enjoy a life of pleasures in such a way as not to conflict with Dharma and Artha, that one should not lead a life devoid of pleasures altogether. The Anuśāsa naparva (chap. III. 18-19 ) states that Dharma, Artha and Kāma are the three prizes ( fruits ) of human life, these three should be striven for but in such a way as not to coflict with Dharma'. The Manusmrti (V. 56 ) declares that eating flesh, drinking intoxicants and sexual intercourse are not sinful in themselves; all beings are naturally inclined to these; but abstention (from these ) leads to great rewards (and therefore Śāstra emphasizes abstention)'. The Rāmāyaṇa ( Araṇyakāpda 9.30 ) contains a statement similar to Svargarohanaparva 5.62.

When reforms are suggested in these days, conservative people put forward the plea that ours is 'sanātana-dharma' 2612 and so no changes should be introduced. But the words 'sanātana dharma' do not mean that Dharma always stands still or is immutable; all that those words mean is that our culture is very ancient and has a long tradition behind it but they do not mean that Dharma permits no change. As a matter of fact funda mental changes in conceptions, beliefs and practices have been made from ancient times to the medieval times by means of various devices. Attention may be drawn to a few. Veda was all in all in very ancient times but in the Upaniṣads this was changed, the Muṇdaka I. 1. 5 designating the four Vodas as inferior knowledge ( aparā vidyā) and the knowledge of the immutable brahman as the higher vidyā; in the Chān. Up. VII. 1.4, the four Vedas and several other branches of knowledge are called by Sanatkumāra (whom Narada approached for instruction) mero name (nāma). Yajñas were the most important religious practice in the early Vedic period, but the Mundaka Up. I. 2.7 designates them as leaky boats and regards those who hold them as the best thing to be fools. Vide above pp. 1265–72 about changes in the views on anuloma marriages, on the topio of whose food may be partaken even by a brāhmana, the abrogation of many Vedic practices by the doctrine of Kalivarjya ( matters forbidden in Kali age ) &c. Manu, Yāj., Viṣṇudharmasūtra, Viṣnu and other purāṇas expressly provide that one should not observe but give up what was once Dharma, if it has come to be hateful to the people and if it would end in unhappiness ( vide p. 1270 n. 2071 above). The Sāntiparya2613 expressly states that what was adharma (in one age) may become dharma in another 

2612. One of the earliest occurrences of the word water is found in the Khanapur plates of Madhavavarman (in E, I. Vol. 27, p. 312) edited by Dr. V. V. Mirashi, who assigas it to about the 6th century A. D., in the description of the donee as ' Tatyan a teral (71) glaterrara Ferraforcard etc.'s The land granted was in Retaraka ( modern Retrem in the Satara District of the Mahārāṣtra State). Another early reference to the phrase सनातनधर्म is in ब्रह्माण्डपुराण II. 33. 37-38 अद्रोहश्चाप्यलोभश्च तपो भूतदया दमः । ब्रह्मचर्य तथा सत्यमनुक्रोशः क्षमा धृतिः। सनातनस्य धर्मस्य मूलमेतदुवाहतम् ॥. The worde 'सनातनधर्म ' are used in the sense of ancient practice no longer prevalent in Adiparva 122.18 (Ch, ed.), and in the sense of duty recognised long ago ' in TATTOT, Steyr [€ 19.26, 21, 49 etc.

and that dharma and adharma are both subjeot to the limitations of country and time. Kāma also was not neglected, as the Kama gūtra (particularly its chapter on Dāgaraka-vykta ' I. 4) will show. The extensive Nātyaśāstra of Bharata ( containing about 5000 verses ) is a witness to the aesthetic enjoyment of dance, music and drama in ancient India by thousands of ordinary men and women, 

Hindu thought on the three goals of human life came to this ' do your duty, do not fall into temptations, perform duties for their own sake ( Gita II, 47, III, 19 ), do unto others as you would be done by (Gitā VI. 32, Anusasanaparva 113. 8-9, śānti 259. 20. = Cr. ed. 251. 19), earn wealth but without conflict with dharma and without injury to others and lead a chaste sexual life and enjoy aesthetic pleasures. These summarise the teachings underlying the conceptions of the three puruṣārthas. There was hardly any real pessimism2614 in the principal Dharmaśāstra works except perhaps here and there in the Mahābhārata. They consider life to be worth living, provided all actions are informed by the dictates of Dharma. Manu ( XII. 88-89 ) provides that Karma (conduct or actions ) proscribed by the Veda is of two kinds, viz. pravītla and nivștta, the former leading to happiness in this world and to svarga, and the latter to niṇśreyasa (mokṣa) and requiring complete absence of all hankerings proceded by realization of brahma The Anuśāgana parva ( chap. 146. 76-80 ) divides Dharma into pravsttilakṣana (characterized by persistent activity) and nivșttilakṣaṇa (characterised by abstention from worldly activities and desires), which latter is to be followed for mokṣa and lays down certain practical and salutary rules viz. one should constantly make gifts according to one's ability, constantly offer sacrifices and perform rites to secure one's prosperity. One should collect wealth following what is right and such wealth obtained righte ously should be divided into three parts; one should secure both dharma and artha with one-third of the wealth aoquired, one-third should be spent on Kāma (i, e, chaste sexual life and enjoyment of other pleasures not in conflict with dharma ) and one-third he should increase. Manu (VII. 99 and 101) prescribes similar rules for the king. The same parvan (Agusagana chap. 144, 10-25 

2614, The Bible was very pessimistic, both Christ and Saint Paul regard the world as evil or at least spoiled. Christ calls upon people not to resist evil ( vide Hobhouse · Morals in evolution 'Vol. II, p. 152). 

Provisions for all ordinary men 

1631 

and 31-39 ) dwells at length upon those actions that lead men to heaven (the phrase "te narāḥ avarga-gaminaḥ' is repeated in each Verse). These provisions are meant for all ordinary people. The Rāmāyaṇa 2615 quotes a popular Verge that man is not oondem ned to never-ending misery but joy comes to a man even after a hundred years if he be alive. 

The 4th Puruṣārtha Moksa can be obtained only by a few. It is not a bow which every man or any man can make strung. It was a very difficult path like a razor's edge (Katha Up. III. 14), far more difficult than the path of devotion to & Personal God (Bhagavadgitā XII. 5). The Upaniṣadic doctrine of liberation comes to this that man's nature is really divine, that it is possible for a human being to know and become actually identi. fied with the Godhead, that this should be the ultimate goal of man's life, that this can be achieved by one's ows efforts, but the way to achieve this goal is most difficult and requires the aspirant to give up egotism, selfishness and worldly attachments, Besides, there is another difficulty. The conceptions about mokṣa differ in the different schools of thought like Nyāya Saṅkhya, Vedānta. Even in the Vedānta the conception about Moksa on the part of the different ācāryas differs. Some declared that there were four stages in Mukti viz. Salokya (place in Lord's world ), Sāmipya ( proximity ), Sārūpya ( attaining same form as God ) and Sayujya (absorption ). 2616 These matters cannot be gone into hero,

Dharma is divided into different classes from different standpoints. One classification is into srauta ( based on the Vedas ) and Smārta (based on Smṛtis ). There was another and a more comprehensive classification of Dharma into six classes viz. varnadharma ( duties and rights of varṇas), āśramadharma (rules about the aśramas), varpāśramadharna ( rules enjoined because the person belongs to a certain class and was also in a certain asrama (8.g. the rule that a brāhmaṇa brahmaoāri should carry a staff of palāśa tree), guṇadharma (rules for one who holds or occupies a certain position, as in the case of a king ), naimittikadharma ( rules that have to be observed only on certain occasions such as bath on an eclipse, expiation for a lapse and lastly sāmānyadharma ( duties common to all ( such as those described in pp. 10-11 of the H. of Dh. Vol. II), This leads on to the next important characteristic of Hindu culture and society, viz. varṇas and castes. 

VI. Varnia and custe. The subject of the origin of varna classification, the caste system and the duties, privi leges and disabilities of the four varnas have been dealt with at length in the History of Dharmaśāstra Vol. II. pp. 19–164. It has been shown that the word "varna' (colour) has been applied to Aryas and clāsas in the Rgveda, that these two (āryas and dāsas ) were opposite camps, that brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas are mentioned in the Rgveda, but the word varṇa has not been expressly connected with them. The words Vaisya and Sūdra do not occur in the Rgveda except in the Puruṣasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 12 ) but even in that hymn the word' varna' is not employed with reference to them. That hymn is held to be comparatively a late one by most modern scholars. It may be conceded that at the time when the Puruṣasūkta was composed the community was divided into four groups viz brāhmaṇas (thinkers, learned men, priests ) kṣatriyas (rulers and warriors), vaiśyas (common people following agriculture and crafts ) and sudras ( those that did menial work). Such a division of people into four groups is not unnatural and is found in many countries even now. In England there are aristocratic families, there is the middle class and the workers in factories &c. They are not necessarily based on birth alone, though largely so based. It has been shown above (p. 1265 ) that intermarriages between brāhmaṇas and the other varnas were allowed up to the time of the Yājā. valkya Smrti which expresses its dissent from its predecessors 

No evidence of prohibition of marriage among four varṇas 1633 

and prohibits a person of the three upper classes from marrying a sūdra woman. There is no evidence to show that intermarriage or interdining among the four varpas was prohibited in the 

Vedic age. In the Vāj. 8. 30. 6-13, Kathaka S. XVII. 13, Tai, Br, III, 4, 2-3 numerous artisans and craftsmen such as takṣan, rathakāra, kulāla, karmāra, niṣāda, sūta and others are mentioned but it is extremely doubtful whether they had become petrified caetes at the period of these works. Rathakāra and karmāra and sūta are mentioned in Atbaryaveda III. 5. 6-7. It is probable that by the time of the Chan. Up. V. 10.7 Cāṇdalas had become untouchables (like dogs and hogs ) and Paulkaga seems to be equated with Cāṇdāla in Br. Up. IV.3.22. Even in the times of Yājāavalkya and Parāśara (2nd to 6th century A.D.) a brāhmaṇa was permitted to take food at the house of such śūdras as bis dāsa, cowberd, barber, a tenant of his land on the rent of half share of crops ( vide above p. 1266 ). The varnas were only four, there was no fifth varṇa (Manu X, 4 and Anuśāganaparva, chap. 48. 30), though in modern time untou obables are often spoken of as pañcamas ( against Smrti usage ). The word jāti in the sense of caste hardly ever occurs in Vedic literature but it occurs in the Nirukta ( XII. 13 ) and in Pāṇini (V. 4. 9 ), who explains brāhmaṇajātiya' as meaning one who is a brāhmaṇa by caste'. Sometimes, Jāti and Varpa are differentiated in Smrtis (Yāj. II. 69, 260 ), but from ancient times the word Jāli is confounded with the word Varna. Manu (X. 31 ) uses the word Varpa in the sense of mixed castes; conversely, the word Jāti is employed in the sense of Varpa ' in Manu ( VIII, 177, IX. 85-86, X. 41 ). 

A sort of caste system existed in several countries such as Persia, Rome and Japan, but it disappeared and had never attained the complexity of the Indian Caste system. 

There are now several thousand castes and sub-castes in India. How they arose is, according to the present author, an insoluble problem. Sherring in Hindu Tribes and Castes' (1881, vol. III, p. 231 ) beld that caste was an invention of the brāhmaṇas ). How such a huge system could be invented and imposed upon millions of people by a small minority without physical or political power never occurred to the prejudiced Christian missionary of the third quarter of the 19th century. 

It is well-known that at least from the 6th century B. O.

History of Dharmasisira 



onwards India was being invaded by Persians, Kambojas,2617 Greeke, Scythians ( generally held to be the same as Sakaa), and people like Pāradas, Pablavas, Cinas, Kirātas, Daradas (Dards ) and Khaśas emigrated into India. Manu ( X, 43-44 ), after mentioning these and Paundrakas, Odras ( Orissa ), Dravidas, asserts that these were originally Ksatriyas but had become Sūdras because the sacraments like Upanayana bad ceased among them and because they lost contact with brāhmapas, Manu X. 45 shows that in his day there were mixed castes that spoke mleocha tongues and Arya languages but were treated as dasyus ( śūdras). Gautama-dharmazūtra (IV. 14-17 ), Manu X. 5-40, Yāj. I, 91-95 and many other works dilate upon the rise of inixed castes from the trarriages or unions of men and women of different vargas and declare how further castos and sub-castes arise from the marriages and unions of men and women belong ing to different classes and castes. This was called Vurn isunkara or simply sarkara, about wbich Arjuna expressed concern ( Gitā I. 41-42) and against which the Bhagavad-gitā (111. 24-25 ) inveighs bitterly. It was stated by Gautama (Dh, S. VIII, 3) that the prosperity ( of the castos and sub-castes ), protection and the non-mixture (of varnas ) depend on the king and learned brābmaṇas. The Nasik Inscription of king Siri Pulumāyi (E. I. Vol. VIII. p. 60 about 130 A. D.) extols the king as baving prevented the intermicgling of vardas (Varpasankara). 

The mixture of castes ( varnasankara )2618 had gone so far even in the early ages that in the Vanaparva (180, 31-33 ) Yudhiṣthira is made to say that 'It is difficult to ascertain the

oaste of a person on account of the confusing mixture of Varnas; all men raise progeny from all sords of women; therefore, those who are wise regard character as the principal and desirable matter' (q. in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 61 n. 149). The original scheme of varpas was natural and based on the work that men put in for the community as a whole. It was not based on birth. The ideas underlying the original varṇa system made the nearest approach towards a society in which there was no attempt to secure a competitive equality but in which the interest of all groups were regarded as identical. In Vedic times there were only classes and pot castes in the modern sense. Even in the smrtis when many castes had arisen the greatest emphasis was laid on duties rather than on privileges and on high moral character and the value of the effort made by a man. It is therefore stated in the Gitā ( IV. 13 ) that the system of four varṇas was created on the basis of quality (or on the basis of sattra, rajas and tamas ) and actions and (in XVIII. 42-44 ) it specifies the qualities and actions required in the four varṇas as an ideal, viz. serenity of mind, self-control, austerity, purity, forbearance, straightforwardness, wisdom ( spiritual knowledge ), knowledge (of all kinds ), faith (in God ) these are the natural actions ( duties ) for a brāhmaṇa; bravery, fury, energy, steadiness, capability, not running away in battle, charity and rulership these are duties of a kṣatriya; agriculture, keeping herds of Cows (and cattle ), trade and commerce-these are the natural duties of the Vaibya; work of the nature of service is the natural duty of the Sūdra. These words of Gitā cannot be used for supporting the present scheme of thousands of castes and sub-castes of water-tight character. If birth had been regarded as the sole or principal basis, the words in the Gita 2619

It is remarkable that the late Lokamānya Tilak advocated about four months before his death (in the issue of the 'Kesari' of 16th March 1920) that anyone who spent his life in Indian freedom struggle must be treated as a brābmaga to whatever caste or sub-caste-he might bave belonged by birth, that caste should not be treated as a matter of birth but that we must begia to treat it as dependent on qualities and actions and he relies on our sastras and quotes in support a Pali verse from the Sattanipata ; 591 hotela 

ga wign I n Thit eta aurrera en la man does not become a Vļsala, that is, Sūdra by caste (or birth) nor does be become a brahmana by birth; a man becomes a vrpala or a brāhmaga by his actions' (compare Mabāvagga, vāseṭthasutta, verse 57 in SBE Vol. X part 2 p. 115 ).

It would be noticed that out of the nine harmūṇi specified as natural to brāhmaṇas most are moral and spiritual and do emphasis is laid on the element of birth. At the time of the Mabābhārata there must have been a great deal of ferment, some revolt and criticism about the petrified caste system. The epic frequently refers to the theme of vardas and jātis. Vide for example, Vanaparva (chapter 180), Virātaparva 50. 4-7, Udyoga 23. 26, 40, 25-29, Santi 188. 10-14, Anusāsana 143. A few passages may be got out here. Santi 188. 10 says there is no (real) distinction between the varpas, (since ) the whole world is of Brahmi, since it was formerly created by Bralmā, and has had the system of varnas on account of the various actions (of men)'; Santi ( 189, 4 and 8) &vers that man is known as brāhmana in whom are seen truthfulness, generosity, absence of hate, absence of wickedness, shame (restraint for avoiding wrong-doing), compassion and a life of austerity; if these signs are observed in a sūdra and are not found in a brāhmana, then the sūdra is not a sūdra ( should

not be treated as a sūdra ) and the brāhmaṇa is not a brāhmaṇa. A similar passage ooours in Vanaparva 216. 14-15 ( quoted above in note 1640 pp. 1005-6 and compared to Dhammapada 393, translated on p. 1005). When the wrangles between Vaiṣpavas and others were at their highest the Bhagavatapurāṇa (VII. 9. 10) avers that a cāndala who is a devotee of Viṣou is superior to a brahmana who is not a devotee of Viṣeū. Apart from the specific qualities required to be possessed by the members of each of the four varpas, all Dharmaśāstra works attach the highest importance to certain moral qualities and enjoin them on all men. Manu X. 63, Yāj. I. 22, Gaut. Dh. S. VII). 23-25, Matsya 52. 1-10 (quoted above on p. 1023 n. 1652) prescribe for all Varnas a brief code of morals, such as abimsa, truthfulness, non stealing (i. e, no wrongful taking of another's property ), purity and restraint of the senses. The Mitakṣarā on Yāj. I. 22 explains that the word 'saryeṣām 'therein states that these moral qualities if practised are the means of Dharma for all men from brāhmaṇas to cāṇdālas. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 10–11 for different enumerations of dharmas common to all men. The Manusmṛti (1.1) begins by saying that the great sages requested Manu to expound the dharmas of all varnas and of the intermediate castes. This ( viz. the Dharmas of vardas, intermediate castea and asramas ) is the principal topic in most of the smrtia. 

A very high ideal was placed before brāhmaṇas ( vide above pp 936-938). They were to study the Veda and its subsidiary lores as a duty (to be discharged ), were to perform sacrifices and make gifts also and their proper means of livelihood were only three viz, teaching the Veda and Śāstras, officiating as priests in sacrifices and receiving religious and other gifts. How arduous learning the Veda was will be clear when it is remembered that a brāhmaṇa who was to be regarded as a very learned one had to memorize one Veda at least. Supposing he was a student of the Rgveda he had to commit to memory the ten thousand and odd verses of the Rgveda, also its pada-patha, its krama. patha, the Brāhmaṇa text (generally the Aitareya ), the six Vedāngas ( auxiliary works) viz. the Kalpagūtra ( of Asyalāyana generally ), Vyakarana ( the Grammar of Pāṇini in about four thousand sūtras ), the Nirukta ( in at least 12 chapters ), metrics, Śikṣā ( Phonetics ) and Jyotiṣa. The first three of these six Vedāngas are rather longish treatises and abstruse. These extensive texts were generally committed to memory without understanding the meaning and so entailed very great strain on 

1638 

History of Dhar masāstra 



the mind and memory. There were thousands of such brāhmaṇas in India up to the beginning of this century, and even now there are still hundreds of such men. They were to teach the Veda without demanding any fee ( demanding a fee to teach Veda was and is regarded as sinful even to this day). They were allowed to receive a fee if the pupil or somebody on his behalf paid something at the end of studenthood. Not only did they trans:nit the Veda free, but there were in the present author's youth in Konkaṇa and Mahārāṣtra many Vaidik brāhmaṇas who gave free board and lodging to several pupils (or arranged to feed them by turns at the houses of brāhmaṇa families in the village or town). All this has now almost stopped owing to rationing during the world wars and present high prices. So teaching hardly brought any regular and substantial amount of money ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 108-110 ). As regards officiating as priests, that was a precarious and fitful source of income. Besides, in Rg. times at least, the scion of a royal family could be a purohita i. . a priest ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 109). It should be remembered that all brāhmaṇas were not priests; they could be so if they chose and if they were learned. Further, many learned brābmaṇas refuse even now to act as priests in śrāddhas for pitss ( at least for three years after the man's death ). Pāṇini (V.2.71 ) provides for the forinacion of the word 'Brāhmanaka' meaning a province or country where 'brāhmaṇas followed the profession of arius' and Kautilya (IX. 2 ) also refers to armies of brāhmaṇās, ksatriyas &c. The third source specially permitted to brāhmaṇas was the privilege of receiving religious gifts from a worthy or unblemished person ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 110, 11). Brāhmaṇas could follow other occupations in distress, but even then there were great restrictions imposed on them by Śāstras even when they took to other means of livelihood ( vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 118-132).2620 The ideal set before brāhmaṇag was one of poverty, of plain living and high thinking, of forsaking a very active pursuit of wealth, of insisting on the necessity and high value to themselves and the Aryan society of studying, preserving, propagating and augmenting the ancient literature and culture. Kings, rich persons and even 

2620. It was, for example, provided by Vasistha (II. 27 ) and Manu X. 92 tbat a brahmana becomes a sūdra by selling milk for three days. Io the present author's boyhood some poor brāhmaṇas had begun to sell milk and the result was that they were very much looked down upon by the villagers. There would be the temptation to add water to the milk to gain money.Ancient ideal set before brāhmanas 

1639 

ordinary men made gifts of lands and houses to learned brāhmaṇas ( which were deemed the most meritorious gifts ) 2621 The present author saw in his boyhood very learned Vaidika brāhmaṇas themselves ploughing their own lands, while repeating inaudibly the Veda (i. e. revising it, as otherwise it might slip from their memory ) and know a middle class Vaidika brābmaṇa family that for seven generations had taught Voda to a number of pupils and provided them with free board and lodging; (out of these seven the present author personally know three generations, the last of whom stopped a few years ago the Vaidika school owing to present high prices of food, decrease in gifts due to the increasing poverty of the people round about and their unconcern for Vedic studies ). Even in the times of the early Upaniṣads, the brāhmaṇa's first duty was to learn and teach the Veda and to take all knowledge for his province. Ajātaśatru, king of Kāsi, exclaimed, when the brābmaṇa Balaki' Gārgya approached him for knowledge of brahman, this is against the natural usual course that a brāhmaṇa should approach a kṣatriya to learn about brahman' (Bṛ. Up. II, 1. 15). That indicates that many brāhmaṇas must have endeavoured to act up to the old ideal of learning in olden times. They became the custodians of the vast literature that had aocumulated and wag growing every day and were expected to preserve that literature and propagate it. Though every brahmana could not have lived up to the high ideals set up for brāhmaṇas, a very large number must have made as near an approach to the ideal as possible It was the greatness of these letter that led to the glorification of the whole class. In most communities there is a group of the elite, which represents the ideals of the whole community, its essential tendencies and acts up to the ideals. Learning, great moral and spiritual attainments among individuals are rather slusive and impalpable, while birth in & certain family is a very obvious thing. Most people in ancient and medieval times followed the occupation of their forefathers. The kingly office was highly eulogised by Manu ( VIII. 4-8), who propounded the theory that the king represented in his person eight deities ( Indra, Agni, Varuna, the Sun, the Moon, Kubera, Yama and Vāyu) and that the king was a great divinity in human form. The office of the king also was hereditary. 

2621. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 113 241 for large gifts to brāhmaṇas, in the early centuries of the Christian era, of villages, cows and marriage expenses, 

1640 





Except in a few cases the brāhmaṇas were never rulers. It was the ksatriyas and śūdras that were rulers. Therefore, & generalisation was made that birth in a particular group or family was a more or less sure indication of the possession of certain qualities generally associated with the members of that group or family. The brāhmaṇas were teachers with no salary, officiated as priests when called and were given fees, but there was no assurance of a continuous and certain payment. They had no church organization 2622 ( such as Archbishops, bishops, priests, deacons in the Anglican Church ) and monasteries for monks among Buddhists and in the Christian Church. The brāhmaṇas were not monks but house. holders who had to maintain a family and bring up children and to make their sons learned and of high moral and spiritual worth. There is no example in the whole world of & small minority of the population of a country, that had no military strength behind it, being revered for at least thirty centuries without any serious challenge not only by the common people but by nobles and kings. What was the basis of the reve rence shown to brāhmaṇas as a class for at least three thousand years? They were believed to be religious, moral and spiritual leaders and the possessors and representatives of an idealistio culture ('ideational' in the language of Prof. Sorokin ). The gecret of the power of and regard for brāhmaṇas had been the fact that as a class they performed well three of their appointed tasks of study, teaching and comparative renunciation ( in spite of the failings of some individual brāhmaṇas ). The brāhmaṇas had no army to support them and they could not, by devoting themselves to physical sciences, find new sources of income or well-being for themselves or for the whole community. 

Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru in his Autobiography (p. 432 ) pays in passing a tribute to the Brāhmaṇa ideal as follows. But the West also brings an antidote to the evils of this cut-throat civilization - the principles of socialism, co-operation and service to the community for the common good. This is not so unlike the old Brabm in ideal of service etc.' The ancient Indian culture exalted the mind and soul over the body and henos arose an extra-ordinary development of asceticism,

Days in halt Jawaharlates or for 

Abolition of caste system 

1641 

If in modern times the caste system has broken down and has become harmful and unpopular among all people, it may be sorapped and discarded ( vide above p. 1270 note 2071 for provisions about this ). But such a huge and all-pervading system cannot be destroyed in a short time nor by legislation, What those who desire to destroy altogether the caste system want is not clear. Do they want complete westernization of the whole of India? To the present author this appears to be not only very difficult but almost impossible. Legislation may help a little, but it cannot eradicate within the foroseeable future the mental attitudes and outlook of millions of people. Cases have been reported where village kunbis and craftsmen thre atened to beat untouchables that wanted to draw water from & village well in the presence of a magistrate. If this campaign against the whole caste system is carried on with force, there are sure to be widespread riots and disorders and the Independence of the country attained after two centuries of colonial rule may be jeopardized. Two matters must be carefully considered and strenuously worked for. Government must see to it that nationalism, the emotion of being one people, in spite of differences in some respects, must be instilled from childhood and among the masses. For that purpose free and compulsory education for all children on national lines must be achieved as quickly as possible. Merely inveighing against casteism by leaders would not do, when people often suspect them as guilty of other 'isms' (such as nepotism ). Universal primary and secondary education, growing number of inter-caste marriages, a growing sense of solidarity as to essentials of culture ( though petty differences may exist) would be the first requisites in any scheme of the removal of castes, Besides, very large numbers of self-sacrificing men, of high moral character and devotion to duty would be required for eradicating the evils of the decayed Oaste system. Another matter also must be very carefully considered. What is going to be substituted in place of the old oaste system? People are afraid that a new caste system of ministers, bureaucrats, captains of industry, men in power and workers is going to be substituted without the saving grace of the ancient caste system, 

It should not be forgotten that high spiritual life and mokṣa were not denied to the sūdra. It is true that the Purvamimāmsā denied to the sūdra the right to study the Veda and to perform Vedic sacrifices ( VI, I. 26 ). But even in those ancient timea 

H, D 206 

1642 



180o. X, Ch. XXXVI 

one sage, Badari, advocated that the sūdra could atudy the Veda and perform Vedic sacrifices (P. M. S. VI. 1. 27). Besides, it should be noted that the sūdra was not at all debarred from a spiritual life and could secure mokṣa by studying the Mahābhārata ( which contains thousands of perses on Mokṣa), which Vyasa compassionately composed for the benefit of women and sūdras and which calls itself (in Adiparva chap. 62. 23 ) Dharmaśāstra, Arthasāstra and Mokṣaśāstra, as declared by the Bhāgavata purāṇa I. 4. 25. All that was decided was that a sūdra could not secure Mokṣa by the study of Veda. Saṅkarācārya on V.S. I. 3. 38 points out that sūdras like Vidura (Ādiparva 63. 96-97 and 114, 106. 24-28, Udyogaparva 41.5 ) and Dharma-vyādha ( Vanaparya 207 ) possesed knowledge of brahmavidyā and that it is impossible to say that they were not able to secure Mokṣa. Vide above pp. 921-2% and note 1468a for the discussion of the relevant passages. It is noteworthy that even in early Vedic times the Rathakāra (a caste not belonging to any of the three higher classes ) was allowed to set up Vedic fires and could repeat certain Vedic mantras for that purpose and the Niṣada ( also not belonging to any of the three varpas, but being a sūdra ) was allowed to perform an iṣti to Rudra with Vedic mantras. Vide pp. 1290-91 (for Rathakāra ) and pp. 1295-96 ( for Niṣāda ) above. These facts show that Vedic sacrifices had penetrated into certain sūdra castes long before the sūtras and smśtis The Bhagavatapurāṇa (VII. 9.10) was prepared to hold that 8 cāṇdāla (by birth ) if he becomes a devotee of Viṣnu was superior to a brāhmaṇa who was not such a devotee. 

The disappearance of the caste system, when it comes about, will not at all imply the disappearance or destruction of all that for which Hinduism has stood up during several millennia. 

We should not be constantly harping on the oaste system au the only or most basic cause of our downfall. The Moslems Lave no caste system and yet most of the Moslem countries in the world have been backward and under the thumb of Western powers. China, Japan and the countries in S. E. Asia bad hardly anything like the caste system of our country, but the first two about a hundred years ago were very backward and many of the countries in S. E. Asia were within the Colonial Empire of Holland, a small country the population of which is even now only about eleven millions. Since 1818 when the British acquired the Decoan, for about 130 years what little 

Downfall due to lack of certain virtues

royal power remained in India was distributed among about 600 princely States ruled by ksatriyas and others and hardly a dozen brāhmaṇa States existed among those 600. What little trade and commerce existed or was allowed by the British to Indians was in the hands of Parsis, Bhatias, Banias, Marvadis, Jains and Lingayats and the brāhmaṇas had very little share in trade and commerce. It was the brāhmaṇa politi cians like Tilak that insisted on Swadeshi. Agriculture, money lending and Zamindari were mostly in the hands of non-urah maṇas except in Bengal and contiguous territories where the Zamindari system supported by Lord Cornwallis prevailed. Our downfall for centuries was due to lack of certain virtues and idealogies among all our people, high or low. Let us, therefore, all Indians, stop blaming the oaste system for our downfall and try to eradicate it or lessen its evils and cultivate virtues like duty for duty's sake, high endeavour, high moral character, nationalism, freedom and justice. 

VI. Aśramas : Another important characteristio of our culture is the system of Aśramas, which have been in existence for certainly several centuries before the Christian era. The word Aśrama does not occur in the Vedic Samhitās or Brāhmaṇas, In Sv. Up. VI. 21 oocurs the word ' atyāśramibhyaḥ'( to the best of ascetics ) which indicates that the word ' āśrama'had then been known. A generic word comprehending several matters is coined long after the several words for the component parts have been current for centuries. The word śrāddba doos not ooour in any ancient Vedic passages, though the Piṇdapitryajõe ( per formed by an agnihotrin on each Amāvāsyā), the Mahāpitçyajña (performed in the cāturmāsya rite Sākamedha) and the Aṣtaka rites ( all of which are rites in honour of pitȚs) were known in early Vedic literature ( vide H. of Dh. VOL IV. pp. 349–50 ). Similarly, some of the āśram as were certainly known from the times of the Rgveda, The Aśramas 2623 long before the time of the sutra literature at least have been four viz. brahmacarya ( stage of studenthood), gārhasthya (householder stage ), vāpaprasthya ( stage of forest hermit) or vaikhānasa (Gaut. III, 2 ), Sannyasa (stage of ascetic life ) or Mauna or Pārivrājya or Pravrajyā or Bhikṣu ( Gaut. III, 2 ). Asramas have been dealt with in H. of Dh. VOL II pp. 416-426, brahmacarya in H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 349-382, forest hermit (in pp. 919–929 ) and sandyāga in pp.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Beo. X, Oh.XXXVI 930-975 (of the same volume ). The span of human life is said to be one hundred years or winters or autumns from the times of the Roveda (Rg. VI. 4, 8; 10.7, 12, 6, 17. 15, 24. 10 in all these hundred winters ), VII, 101. 6, X. 161. 3 and 4 (autumns ). As no one could say how long one might live it is not to be supposed that each stage was of 25 years; all that is meant is that a man may, if he lives long, pass through the four stages. The word brahmacārl occurs in Rg. X. 109.9 and Tai, 8. VI. 3. 10.5 and brahmacarya in Tai. S. VI. 3, 10.5 and Tai, Br. III, 10. 11. In Rg. VI. 53. % occurs the word 'gçhapati' (lord of the house ) meaning the same thing as grhastha. Indra is said to be the friend of munis (in Rg. VIII. 17. 14 ) and yatis are said to have praised Indra ( Rg. VIII 6. 18). The Katha Up. IV. 15 saying that the self of the Muna ( knowing the reality) becomes one with the Supreme Self indicates that the reference is to a Sannyāsin who had realized the Supreme Spirit. The Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 saying that the Great Self is the Lord of the universe, that brāhmaṇas seek to know him by study of the Veda, by sacrifices and gifts, by austerities (tapas) and by fasting and that, after realizing that Supreme Self the man becomes a muni, that desiring this stage only the wandering (ascetics ) leave home ( take to that stage ). Here those engaged in tapas are placed at an earlier stage than pravrajyā. Therefore, the Ch. Up. II. 23. 1, speaking about three branches of Dharma, should be taken as mentioning the three āśramas and the words 

one who is firmly established in brahman obtains immortality should be taken as referring to the 4th Aśrama. As pointed out in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 928–929 most of the rules laid down for forest hermits are the same as those for the sannyāsin and there was difference between the two in a few matters only. From Br. Up. II. 4.1 ff. and IV, 5. 2 ff. (where the word pravrajiṣyan is used) for udrūsyan (in II. 4. 1) it follows that Yajñavalkya became a sannyāsin (or parivrājaka) immediately after leaving the householder's life. Later op in the Kalivarjya acts the stage of being a forest hermit is included. Vide H. of Db. Vol. II, p. 420 n. 999 on Chān. Up. II. 23.1. The stage of householder ( grhastha) was highly praised. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 424-425, 640-41, Vol. V. pp. 1026-27. 

The stage of sannyāsa or yati was highly honoured, because it was deemed to lead to mokṣa. The result was that many persons quite unfit to lead the life presoribed for a real sanayisin only entered the order and possessed all the outward

signs of that stage such as wearing ocbro-coloured garments, shaving the head, carrying three staffs and a water jar. They are condemned in the Mahābhārata, śāntiparya 308. 47 (or, ed. = 320. 47 Ch, ed.) quoted in H. of Dh. Vol. II p. 936 n 2151b and above p. 1369 n. 2241 ). Yāj. IIL 58 provides that the sannyāsin should be good to all beings, quiescent, have three dapdas and a water jar and should enter a village for begging alms. Some interpreted the word fridandi as meaning carrying three staffs', while others like Manu XII. 10 and Daksa VII, 30 provide that a person is called tridandı who observes threefold restraint, viz, of speech, mind and body. The sannyāsin was so highly esteemed that for deciding doubtful points of dharma a single ascetic was allowed to do the work of a pariṣad and declare the proper decision (vide H, of Dh. Vol. II p. 969). Similarly, great emphasis was laid on inviting a Yati at a śraddha dinner (vide H. of Dh. Vol. IV pp. 388, 399). The Bșhaj-jātaka ( chapter 15 ) deals with the question about the horoscopio indications for different kinds of ascetics being born on the conjunction of four or more powerful planets in the same sign of the zodiac in the horoscope and adds that according as Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, the Moon, Venus, Saturn, or the Sun is the most powerful of the four or more planets in one sign in a horoscope, the person whose nativity it is becomes respectively an ascetio of the types of Bauddha, Ajivika,2624 a bhikṣu ( i. e. vedio ascetic), Vṛddha (a Kāpālika), & caraka, a nirgrantha (a Jain ascetio ) or one subsiating on forest produce, fruits, roots &c. 3625 This shows that long before Varahamihira (6th century A.

how they should order their lives and what preparations are required for the several goals of human life. Deussen in the 

• Philosophy of the Upanisade' (English translation of 1906, p. 397 ) says about the Asrama theory that the entire history of mankind does not produce much that approaches in grandeur to this thought.' 

VII. The doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma (transmi gration or metem psychosis ). 

This is one of the most fundamental dootrines of the Hindu system of religion and philosophy and is unique in its own way, particularly in its long continuity and immense early literature. It has been dealt with above in a separate and extensive chapter ( XXXV pp. 1530 ff). It is not, therefore, necessary to say anything more here. 

VIII. Another important doctrine is that of ahiinsā. So far as the Upanisads, Mahābbārata, Dharmaśāstras and Purāpas are concerned the subject of ahirsū has been dealt with above in pp. 944-947 and in Vol. II, p. 30. A few matters are briefly mentioned here. The words kratu and ynjña occur hundreds of times in the Rgveda. The difference sometimes made is this that the word ynjña is yery general (including the five daily religious duties laid down in Manu III. 70), while kralu ia confined to solemn Vedic sacrifices like Somayāga. Panini mentions the two separately (IV.3.68 ) and the Gitā IX, 16 (aham kraturabam yajñaḥ ) also does the same. Animals were offered in some of these, though not in all. Gradually it came to be thought even in the Rgveda times that worshipping Agai with fuel sticks or with an oblation of cooked food or ghee or with Veda study or obeisances or with a solemn sacrifice is on the same level and the worshipper is rewarded with swift horses (dashing against enemies ) and with bighest glory and no trouble whether divine or due to mon, reaches him (Rg. VIII. 19. 5-6). Some Brāhmaṇa texts are couched in the same strain. The Ait. 2626 Br. (VI. 9 ) remarks' he who offers a cake performs a sacrifice equal to the offering of all sacrificial animals'. The Tai, Br. provides that the forest sacrificial animals, after a firebrand is carried around them, are let off for the sake of abiṁsā. Dr. A. Schweitzer in bis 'Indian thought and its deve lopment' (tr. into English by Mrs. Russell, 1936) tries hard to establish a contrast between the attitude of what he calls' world and life negation' in Hindu thought and 'world and life affir.

mation characteristic of Christianity and as a side issue remarks (on p. 80 ) that 'the ahims commandment does not arise from a feeling of compassion but from a feeling of keeping, & person undefiled'. The learned author ignores several things; firstly, 2627 not a word is said about purity (sauca) in the 

2627. This is not the place to give a lengthy reply to Dr. Schweitzer's remarks. Dr, Schweitzer's compliment to Christ, Christianity and the West was criticized by Dr. Radhakrisbnad in Eastern Religion and Western thought. (1939 pp. 76-110 ) and by Shri D. S. Sharma in 

• Renaissance of Hinduism' pp. 618-634. On p. 2 Dr. Schweitzer boldly asserts that world and life affirmation unceasingly urges men to serve their fellows, society, the nation, mankind and indeed all that lives with their atmost will &c. One should like to know the Biblical passages where all this grand thought is explicitly stated. On p. 4 he contradicts himself when he says. Christianity also brought European thougbt into relation with world and life aegation.' The two great commandments of Jesus are first' to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul' and the second is 'thou shalt love thy neigbbour as thyself'( vide Matthew 22.37 and 39 and Mark 12. 30-31). This is hardly anything like what Schweitzer says about Christianity's world and life affirmation, Not a word is said here about even loving all buman beings, much less loving all that lives'. The world has had enough of the world and life affirmation of Christianity ( or rather of Christian Dations or people). Attention is invited to H, of Dh. Vol. II. p. 180, where Westermarck's remarks in his Origin and development of the moral ideas' (1912) Vol. I. p. 711 are cited on slavery, The world knows wbat during the last four or five bandred years the colonial empires of Christian countries like England, France, Holland, Belgium, Portagal and Spain did in India, Africa, S, E, Asia, the Congo and America. O p. VII of his Preface he appears to contradict himself when he disagrees with the view of Schopenhauer and Deussen about Indian thought being completely governed by the ideal of world and life negation and admits the fact that 'world and life affirmation is present at the back of this thought (Indian thought ) from the very dawn of its history, and lifa negation and world and life affirmation constitute its chief characteristic and determine its development'. Both books ( Dr. Sweitzor's and Dr. Radbakrishnan's) are reviewed in Hibbert Journal' for 1953 pp. 234-241 and 355-363 by O. W. M. Gell who finds both works disappointing, holds that Schweitzer has misunderstood the Hindu ideal of sopra-ethical man, that aegation and affirmation have not been properly defined by him, that it was only very late in Christian history that the West began to work actively for improvement of social and economic conditions, Social service was not anknown in Ancient India. The very idea of 'pūrta 'dharma is social service. Vide above pp. 947-949, The Purāṇas emphasize the importance of work for relieving distressed beings. For example, the Mārkaqdeya has the following very noble sentiment (15. 57).men would not obtain that happiness in heaven or in the world of Brahmā which arises from giving happiness to distressed mea' (a ETT T ara a sua at: i vores facforamcurrat Hall)Vide also note 6 op pp. 3-4 of H, of Dh. vol.

Chandogya and other passages about ahimsi. Secondly, the injunction about not giving pain to any being (in Chān. Up.) is immediately preceded by the words 'having concentrated all his senses on the Self'. That shows that one who knows and has come to realize that all is brahma should give no pain to others as all those also are brahma and not on the ground of purity or defilement. Further, in the Mahabharata and Smṛtis some of which at least are not far removed in time from the Upaniṣada both ahimsa and sauca ( purity ) are separately mentioned along with other duties ( dharmas) common to all varpag. Gaut. ( 8. 23-24 ) lays down eight qualities of the soul for every dvija viz, compassion towards all beings, forbearance, freedom from jealousy, freedom from excessive harm ( to himself ), doing auspicious acts, absence of abjectness (or miserliness ), absence of discontent'. The same eight are specified in the Matsya purāṇa 52, 8-10, Atrismrti 34-41. Manu V. 46 ( = Viṣnu Dh. 8. 51. 69 ) provides 'he who does not desire to cage or kill or cause pain to living beings, thus desirous of doing good to all, secures highest ( or never ending ) happiness'. Sauca is external ( of the body ) and internal ( of the mind). Manu V. 106 expressly says that he who is pure as to money matters is really pure and not one who washes himself with sand or water. Vide above pp. 1421-22 notes 2331 and 2333. It is worthy of note that the Santiparve (chapter 162, 4-5 = Or. ed. 156, 4-5) contains an apotheosis of Satya as the ancient Dharma and brahman itself and then in verses 7-9 Satya is stated to appear in thirteen aspects such as tyāga ( renunciation of attachment and pleasures ), samata (boing the same to all), dama ( restraint of senses ), kṣamā ( forbearance), hri (being ashamed to boast of one's good deeds ), anasūyā (absence of jealousy ), daya ( compassion ) and so on, ahimsā being the 13th aspect of Satya. 

It was only in Jainism that thoroughgoing abiriga was proached and practised. Buddha had no objection to eating flesb, provided the animal was not killed specially for doing him honour or treating him. 

IX. The three paths, viz. Karmamārga, Bhaktimarga and Jāānamārga. These have already been dealt with above in pp. 964-967, 1462. The Bhagavadgita expounds the further doctrina of what is called niṣkāma-karmayoga, which has been explained above on pp. 966–67. Doing one's duty without bankering for the fmit thereof is worship of God.Adhikarabheda 

1848 

X Adhikāra-bheda 

It was recognised in India from very early times that in the matter of religious worship and philosophical doctrinor, there are different grades among human beings. All are not competent to grasp and act upon abstruse metaphysical doctrines or to follow higher forms of worship. This has been brought out in several places before. Vide above p. 973 note 1593 and p. 1462. Abstruse metaphysical doctrines are likely to be misunderstood and therefore we find that there is an effort to koop such doctrines secret and frequent warnings are given in the Upaniṣads not to impart the knowledge of brahman to all and sundry and to keep it secret. Vide p. 1071-72 and Chan. Up. III. 11. 5 set out above on p. 1460, Śv. Up. VI. 22, Katha Up. III. 17, Bļ. Up. III. 2. 13 ( Yājñavalkya and Artabhāga did not discuss brahman among people ). The word Upaniṣad came to mean'secret doctrine' (vide Tai. Up. II. 9 and III. 10 ). This tendency to keep abstruse doctrines secret obtained in other nations in antiquity (vide St. Mark 4. 11, 34-35). The Hathayogapradipika 2628 has similar provisions (vide p. 1460 above). Many modern writers condemn people that engage in image worship. The reasons advanced for image worship by Indian works are given in note 1593 p. 973 above. The worshipper of an image of Ganega or Kāli casts the image in water ( a river, sea &o.) after a day or more (when the period of the festival is over ). So it is not as if he worshipped the wooden or earthen object but he has an emotional idea for the time being that God is enthroned in that object. These common people, if questioned, will say "God is everywhere, in you, in me and in the wooden image'. The Nrsimhapurāpa 62.5 ( quoted by Aparārka p. 140 on Yāj. I. 101 ) says that sages declare that the worship of Hari (God Viṣnu) may be performed in six ways, yiz, in water, in fire, in one's own heart, in the sun's orb, on an altar or in an image. 1629 The Viṣnudharmotturapurāṇa appears to have been conscious that image worship came later in Kali age and was not prevalent

in former ages (IIL obap. 99. 5-7 and 20). Tie prosent author saw in several European Churches the images of the Madonna or the images or pictures of certain saints worshipped by Christian people that addressed prayers to the image of the Madonna or the piotures of saints for fulfilment of their desires. Therefore, he thinks that it would not be wrong for him to say that the religion of many Christians in Europe is image worship. 2630 The several darśanas (except that of Cārvāka ) were looked upon generally as approximations to truth. There was no question of all of them being false and one alone as containing the truth. 

(XI) Vast Sanskrit literature. 

India produced a vast amount of Sanskrit literature of a most varied character for at least three thousand years. There is no country in the world that can exhibit continuous creation of several departments of literature for such a long period. Sanskrit literature penetrated to countries like Tibet, China, Java and others. Its literature influenced the Moslem world and European world by means of the decimal place value system, its fable literature and system of Vedānta. Vide Winternitz's 'Some problems of Indian Literature ( the Readership Lectures in Calcutta University ) pp. 59–81 for a brief but instructive treatment of the influence of Sanskrit Literature in the West. Its study by Europeans at the end of the 18th century and in the 19th century laid the foundation of several sciences, such as the science of language, of comparative religion, of thought and of mythology. There exist several Histories of Sanskrit Litera ture by several scholars such as Weber, Max Müller, Wintornitz, Keith, M. Krishnamachariar, which will give an idea to any roader of the variety and vastnega of Sanskrit literature. 

2630. Vide 'Hinduism and Baddhisma' by Sir Charles Elliot, Vol. I. Iotro. p. LXX, where a similar view is expressed by the learned writer who relies also on William James' 'Varieties of religious experience ? pp. 525–527. Sir Oliver Lodge in Man and the Universe (London, 1908 ) pp. 246-247) says "There are plenty of good reasons agaiost idolatry among intellectual and 'choseo ' people but this (God was jealous of idol worship) is not one of them; nor is it to be supposed that the stock of a tree is ever really worshipped even when prostrated to. An idol, to ignorant and uadeveloped people, is a symbol of something whicu they are really worship piog under a material form and embodiment, the sensuoua presentation assists their infantile efforts towards abstract thonght as material sacramonte help people in a higher stage of religious development; but some of these holps should be outgrown." 

Vast Sanskrit Literature 

1651 

India has preserved for itself and for the world a vast literaturo in the best part of which the principal theme is to ask mon Dover to cease in their efforts to control the senses and to reach higher and higher heights of morality and spirituality. H. H. Gowen in' A History of Indian Literature' (1931 ) observos (on p. 8) Indian literature has an intrinsic value which no gomoteness avails to destroy. For sacredness, variety and continuity, scarcely any other may compare with it, certainly none surpasses it. As for sacredness no other scripture, not even our Bible, may compete with the Veda in its continuity or in the matter of general acceptance'. He dilates also on the variety and remarkable continuity of Indian literature. Classical Sanskrit first blossoned at least before 500 B.O. Pāṇini names at least ten predecessors and his sūtras IV. 3. 87 and 88 olearly indicate that before his time there was considerable non-vedio secular literature. 

XII. Yoga : Yoga has been treated of above (pp. 1385_ 1462). In the whole world there exists hardly any well thought out and comprehensive system of psychical and moral discipline like Yoga. Mercea Eliade observes (on p. 359 ) in.Yoga, Immortality and Freedom' (tç. by Willard R. Trask, 1958) 

Yoga constitutes a characteristic dimension of the Indian mind, is marked by reaction against metaphysical speculations and the excesses of a fossilized ritualism'. Western minds having experienced a surfeit of economic prosperity, but worried by the tensions and crises of these times are turning more and more to Yoga and to Indian philosophy such as the Vedānta. In recent years numerous books are being published that deal with * perennial philosophy', Yoga (including Tibetan Yoga ). meditation, concentration, mystical experience &o. Many of these books are written by honest people after reading a good deal of literature on these subjeots but they are wanting in any personal yogio or mystio experience. There are some books that are written by persons who want to take advantage of the popular craze for Yoga and similar mystical practices for the sake of wealth and fame. In 'Vedanta for the Western World'edited by Christopher Isherwood (Allen and Unwin, London, 1948) the famous writer Mr. Aldous Huxley sounds a note of warning against the plethora of books on mysticism and Yoga in the market (p. 376 ). 

XIIL Philosophy : 

The central point of much of our philosophy is contained in Ohandogyopanigad VI.1, where Uddalaka inquiros of hia conceited 

1652 

History of Dharmaśāstra [Seo. X, Ch. XXXVI 

son Svetaketu "Have you asked for that instruction by whioh one hears what cannot be heard, by which one perceives what cannot be perceived, by which one knows what cannot be known;' and when Svetaketu asked for that instruction, Uddalaka expounds to him (in VI. 1-16 ) the subject at length and winds up with the words 'tat-tram-asi' (thou art that Se]f). An inquirer into philosophy will find in the various branches of Indian philosophy a vast mass of material, hardly surpassed by any other ancient country in the world. The word for philosophy is darśana and there is a famous work called 'Sarvadarśangangraba in which fifteen different points of view apart from advaita Vedānta are summarised. The principal orthodox darśanas are six- Sāṅkbya, Yoga, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika. Pūrvamimāmgā and Uttaramımāmsā' (or Vedānta ), which have been treated above and their relation to and influence on Dharmaśāstra has been dwelt upon. The chief marks of Indian philosophy aro that it concentrates on the spiritual, that philosophy has to be lived and not merely discussed, that it seeks the Reality. that for real philosophy great moral preparation is necessary, that reason has to be extensively used in arriving at the truth, that tradition and authority have to be accepted and not neglected. Almost all darśanas ( except that of Cārvāka) are concerned with Liberation ( variously called Mokṣa, Kaivalya, Nirvana, Amptatva Niḥśreyaga, Apavarga) and all (except Cārvāka ) are agreed on the doctrine of Karma and Punarjanna. It is not necessary to say more on Indian Philosopby in this Chapter. 

XIV. Arts. Architecture, Sculpture, Painting : 

Though the present author has travelled throughout India for over fifty years and seen most of the famous places rich in ancient architecture, sculpture and painting, he lays no claim to being a connoisseur in those matters and cannot gire his own valuation of these relics of ancient Indian Art. The number of works on these is legion. A more bibliography would not be of much use to the reader. Therefore, he will content himself with mentioning a few works on each of the abovo branches which he has road wholly or partly or which he consulted. 

Among the most remarkable ancient monuments of India are the stūpa at Sanchi, the paintings in the Ajanṭā caves, the 

• 

Puranas on Arts 

1653 

Kallase temple at Ellora, and the Konarka21 temple in Orissa. 

Some of the Puranas contain information on the above topics. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 25%. 2-4) names 18 ex pounders of Vāstuśāstra (architecture ) such as Bhṛgu, Atri, Vasiṣtha, Viśvakarman, Maya, Nārada, Nagpajit, Viśālākṣa, Purandara, Brahmā, Kumāra, Nandiśa, Saunaka, Garga, Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Sukra and Bṛhaspati. Chapters 253–257 deal with the construction of mansions and houses, chap. 258–263 with images of several deities. The Vāyupurāṇa (8.108 ff.) describes the founding of a capital Agnipuriṇa, chapters 42, 104-106 deal with the building of mansions, houses and laying out cities. The Viṣnudharmottara (third section) is called citrasūtra 2632 because danoing is held to be the primary art and painting rests on it. It is further said that painting is the best of arts (III. 33. 38) and the foremost of auspicious things in & bouge, that the rules that apply to painting are applicable to the making of images of metala, stone and wood (UL 43.31-32). Chapters 36-43 deal with painting, chapters 44-85 with the making of images of gods and goddesses and housebuilding is dilated upon in chap. 86 ff The Bṭhat-samhita ( ed. by M. M. Sudhakar Driredi, 1895 ) of Varāhamihira (500-550 A.D.) deals with palaces, mansions and houses of king, crown prince and others; in chap. 52 (123 verses) with temples of several gods, in chap. 53 ( 31 verges) with images of gods, in chap. 57 (Rāma, Viṣnu, Brahma, Indra, Siya, Buddha, Jina, the Sun,

There are several other works like the Yuktikalpataru of Bhoja ( Calcutta ed. of 1917 ), the Abhilaṣitārthacintāmapi ( also called Mānasollāga ) 2633 of king Someśvara, Śilparatna (T. 8. 8.), Mayamata (T. 8. 8.) on these subjects. 

Puintings - The only famous ancient paintings are those in the caves of Ajanta, in the Bagh oaves in the former Gwalior State and those in the caves at Sigiriya in Ceylon. For reasons of space it is not possible to quote the enthusiastio appreciations of Western writers on ancient Indian Art, particularly paintings and sculpture. The author would quote a few passages from Rene Grousset's 2634 works: 'India has given a mighty art or & complete Aesthetic equal in originality and power to the Greek and Chinese. It is marked by its naturalism in depicting animals'. The same writer says about Ajanta's immortal paintings 'they count among the most moving that have ever come within human vision'. In civilizations of the East' (tr. by Mrs. C. A. Phillips, London, 1932 with 249 illustrations) the same author (after citing paintings of the Jātakas of self sacrifice ) remarks these are but a few examples, the most poetic, tender and moving that could be imagined. No better example could be found of that purely Indian sentiment of universal brotherhood, that fervour of humanitarianism which extends even to animals and plants' (p. 79). For Ajanta, there is a fine edition by Dr. G. Yazdani, the text in two parts ( 1930 and 1933 ) and there are besides many coloured and monochrome plates with an Introduotion by Lawrence Binyon. There is also another small work prepared for the use of Lord Reading on his visit to Ajanta in 1924 in which Dr. Yazdani gives ten colour plates and one monochrome plate (of a bull fight ) with notes on some of the scenes in several caves and appreciations by Binyon, Rothenstein, Solomon and others. Another good book is my pilgrimage to Ajanta and Bagh' by Sri Mukul Chandra Doy, with Introduction by Lawrence Binyon (London, 1925 )

A third book on Ajanta is in Marathi written and published in 1929 by Balasaheb Pant Pratinidhi, Chief of Aundh State, with half-tone and coloured Illustrations. Peroy Brown on Indian Painting' deals with Buddhist, Hindu and Mahomedan Painting and covers a long period from 6th century A. D. to 19th Century A. D. He gives two illustrations of Sigiriya paintings opposite pp. 33, 69, which are remarkably similar to some paintings in caves 16 and 17 at Ajanta. In Ananda K. Coomaraswamy's 'History of Indian and Indonesian Art' illustra tions No. 183 and No. 184 are respectively from Bagh and Sigiriya

and general readers, South Indian Architecture and Sculpture has some peoulia rities of its own. Some works thereon may be mentioned here viz. 'Dravidian Architecture by G, J. Dubreuil (1917), *Mahabalipuram' by C. Sivaramamurty (Dept. of Archaeology ) 7 full page plates; 'Art of Pallavas' text and notes by B. O. Ganguly and ed. by A. Goswami, 46 plates ( 1957). 

Besides, on music also several works have been written : Music of Hindustan' (Oxford 1914 ) by A. H. Fox Strangway Alain Danielou's 'Northern Indian music' vol. Iand JI (London, 1949, 1954), H. A.

and Aesthetics' (Poona, 1951). But the present author unfortunately knows little about music. 

Indian architectonic and iconographic symbolism spread to Java, Bali and other parts of Indonesia and many works have been written on this subject such as 'Barabudor (Java) by Paul Mus, G, Gorer's · Bali and Angkor', Towards Angkor by Quaritch Wales (with a full Bibliography at end), W. F. Stutterheim's 'Indian influences in Balinese Art' (London, 1935 ). 

A fow more characteristics could have been mentioned; the present writer desists from adding them since the list is already a long one. It is not claimed that no other culture had or has these characteristics. What is claimed is that there is no other single culture in the world where all these can be found now or existed in the past and that some of these characteristics such as the noble Vedānta concept of man, lower animals and even inanimate things being one in Essence, the great tolerance throughout the ages for differing religious and philosophical views, the emphasis on satya and ahinsa are unique and not found elsewhere.
