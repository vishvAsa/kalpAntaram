CHAPTER XXX On Mināmsā principles and rules of interpretation 

in relation to Dharmasastra 

The Pārvamimamas ayolyed a method of its own and a set of principles for the interpretation of Vedic texts. It is now time to get down and explain some of these principles and rulea and point out how they have been employed by Dharmasastra writers for solving their own difficulties. 

The Mimārsā principles and rules of interpretation fall into several groups. There are rules that are concerned only with the details of Vedic saorifices and their inter-relations. The most important rule in this field is this that only Vidhis proper ly so called have absolute authority and binding force, while what are called arthavādas have authority in so far only as they form one syntactical whole with the vidhis and as they are meant to praise the vidhis. (P. M. 8. I. 2.7). Vidhis and Arthavādas are not discussed consecutively, but they are scattered over the several chapters of the P. M. S. For example, arthavādas are first dealt with in I. %. 1-18 (the arthavadādhi karaña), but in many other places there is a discussion about arthavādas as in III. 4. 1-9, II, 4, 10, III, 4. 11, IV. 3. 1-3, VI. 7. 26–30, X. 8. 5, X. 8. 7 and 8. 

It should not be forgotten that the Mimarisi is not concer ned with legislation by the king or & sovereign popular assembly. It promises to convey Correct knowledge of Dharma ( meaning religious rites and matters connected therewith) and the means of arriving at that knowldge is the Veda itself and the main purpose of the Mimāṁsa is to regulate the procedure (itikarta vyatā), the various auxiliary and principal matters in Vedic sacrifices. 2094 

There is a great deal of difference between the interprota tion of statutes and the Mimāṁsā rules of interpretation. In the

(Soc. VII, OL. XXX 

first place, statutes are man-made, they express the will of the enaoting authority, have mostly secular purposes, may be amended or even repealed and have to be expounded according to the intent of those that made them. But the Mimamsa is Concerned with the Veda that is deemed eternal and self-eristent (and not man-made ), that deals with religious matters, cannot be amended or repealed and is to be expounded according to the intent of the Vedic words. Therefore, though some rules of the interpretation of Vedic texts evolved by the Pūrvamimāmsā are identical with or resemble the rules of the interpretation of statutes developed in such works as Maxwell's on interpretation of statutes', the author will not enter into any detailed treat ment showing the parallelisms betwood Mlmāngā rules and Maxwell's rules. This task was attempted over fifty years ago by Mr. Kishorilal Sarkar in his Tagore Law Lecturos published in 1909. It would appear ungracious on the part of the present author to offer criticisms against a predecessor in the same field who wrote more than half a century ago when Mimāmgā studies by modern educated Indians were in their infanoy. But the author cannot help stating that Mr. Sarkar was obsesed by the notion that he must show somehow or other that Jaimini's rules of interpretation were not inferior to those of Maxwell's and agreed closely with him. For this purpose he relies often on far-fetched analogies and employs obscure explanations. In several cases it appears that he had not been able to grasp correctly what Jaimini and Sabara meant. 2095 

In this work the author is concerned only with the question of the influence on Dharmaśāstra of Pūrvamimāmsā dootrines and rules of interpretation. He has already shown how many of the dootrines and technical expressions of the Mimāṁsā have dominated Dharmagāstra. He would now turn to the rules of interpretation. 

The first rule is that no part of the Veda ( not even a word) can be treated as anarthaka (meaningless or purposeless). It is therefore that a very large part of the Veda is treated 28 artha vadas intended to praise vidhis. This has been stated above (p. 1243). The result of the vital importance attached to vidhis

Result of regarding many Vedic texts as arthavadas 

1285 

in the PMS and of the assignment of a very subordinate role to arthavadas (as merely intended to praise) and to mantras ( as merely 'abhidhāyaka') has resulted in this that a small portion of the Brāhmaṇas has been held to be of supreme authority, while a large part of the Brāhmaṇas and of Sarhitās contain ing mantras has become of secondary importance or of little importance. 

The Mimāmgā rules of interpretation fall into different classes from different standpoints. Some rules are general and some are special. Some rules have to do with the proper proce dure to be followed when several texts laying down matters relating to the same subject are in conflict by means of the application of the technical words sruti, linga, vākya, prakar ana, athāna and samākhyā (III, 3. 14) and there are rules about adhikara, atideśa, ūha, bādha, tantra and prasanga. 

Some examples of general rules may first be cited. That vidhis alone have special obligatory authority and that artha vādas are authoritative only in so far as they form one syntactical whole with the vidhis is a general rule. The rules distinguishing between vidhis (properly so called), niyama vidhis and parisankhyā are general 

The Mimāmgā rule is that where there is a 20% doubt about the exact meaning of a part of a passage, it may be determined by relying on the remaining parts of the pasbage. Vide above for the example 'he puts down anointed pebbles' &c. (p. 1240). The Mimāṁsā is very much against assuming conflict among Vedic texts and therefore allows an option only if there is no other way out. Vide remarks on vikalpa above (p. 1250). Another general rule is that the singular includes the plural. In the Mimāmgā it is called "Grahaikatvanyāya (P. M. S. II. 1. 13-15). In the Jyotiṣtoma sacrifice a number of cups (grahas) filled with Soma are offered to deities and drunk at the three savanas (pressings of Soma) and Sruti states 'he wipes or cleanses the oup with the strainer made of white wool' ( daśapavitrona graham sam-mārsti) and in the Dargapūrṇamāsa it is said 'he carries a firebrand round the purodāsa (cake). The question is

whether a single oup ('graham' is the word used) is to be cleansed or a single purodāsa is to have a firebrand carried round it or whether all cups called grabas or purodagas are to be treated as stated. The established conclusion is that all grahas are to be cleansed and all purodāsas have the firebrand carried round them. The singular number is not intended to be insisted on. 2097 From this a further general rule is derived by Kumārila and others that an attribute of the subject (anuvādya or uddiśyamūna) 20% about which something is predicated (vidheya) is not intended and should not be insisted upon. This is fro quently relied on in Dharmaśāstra works. Yāj. II. 121 states that the father and son have equal ownership in land, & corrody and wealth ( gold and silver &c.) aoquired by the grand-father. Here the word pilāmaha is not to be insisted upon and the same rule applies to land or wealth acquired by a great-grand-father, as the V. M. says. 2099 Similarly, when Nāradasmrti says ( 16. 37) 

of brothers being undivided religious worship (or rites) are one, but if there is a partition then they may have separate religious worship'. Here the proper subject is the word 'undivided persons', and the word 'brothers' is used only as an attribute, which is not intended to be insisted on and the same rule applies to undivided grand-father, father, sons, uncles and nepbows. Medhātithi on Manu II, 29 montions this maxim, The same rule is applied in some cases to gender also i. e. a word importing males includes females also. For example, Yaj. II. 182 and Nārada (8. 40 ff) lay down certain rules about a dāsa (male glave). The V. M. says that the masculine gender in those passages is not intended to be insisted upon, but the rules 

2097. Vide Maxwell (10th ed, of 1953) p. 349 for the propositions that words importing masculine gender include females and that the siagalar includes the plural and vice versa.

apply even to female slaves. 100 There are exceptions to these rules. The rule about grahas does not apply to camasas (P.M. S. III, 1, 16–17). 2001 This rule that the qualification (viboṣana) of the subject in a vidhi is not meant to be taken literally and emphasized is applied in many other cases. Three verses from the Kālikāpurāpa are quoted by Kalpataru (on vyavahāra pp. 210-211) and V.M. (pp. 45-46) about the performance of an ordeal in certain grave charges and this maxim is applied by the V. M. there in the words 'paradārarūpam viśeṣanam-avivakṣitam abhisāpasyānuvādyatvāt'; vide notes to V. M. pp. 83-84. But in 'paśum-ālabheta', where there is a vidhi about 'yāga it must be held that what is laid down is yāga as qualified by being made with a male animal and therefore only one paśu ( and that pasu a male ) is to be sacrificed. 

Although the Veda employs the masculine gender (in gvargakāmo yajota, 'one desiring heaven should offer a sacrifice'), yet Jaimini establishes (in VI. 1. 6-16 ) that even women are included and have a right to offer a yāga. 2102 Jaimini further provides that husband and wife should perform a religious right in co-operation (VI. 1. 17-21), but he provides that where the Sruti specifically provides for certain matters to be done by the yajamāna 2103 (the male performer ) it is the male alone who can 

perform them as the wife is not equal to the husband in the knowledge of mantras and is ignorant and therefore she is restricted to the performance of those acts that are expressly enjoined for her such as looking at the clarified butter, observing brahmacarya and the like (VI. 1.24 'tasyā yāvad-uktam-āsirbra hmacaryam-atulyatvāt'.) The wife also performs bath and such

2101, These two rules that the singular includes the plural and words importing the masculine gender shall be taken to include females are the same in section 13 of the Indian General Clausos Act X of 1897, subject to this that if there is anything repugnant in the subject or context the rale will not apply.

acts as applying collyrium, sipping water (acamana), observes silenca till the morning or evening agnihotra is gone through. She has her waist girt up with & yoktra (a triple cord of muftja grass) in Darsapūrṇamāsa and other sacrifices. She has also to look upon the clarified butter in the pot with a mantra (Tai 8.IL). 10.3.mahinām payosyoṣadhinām rasossi adabdhena tvā cakugas vek se suprajāstyāya' ('thou art the milk of cows, the fluid of borbs, with an invincible eye I look on thee for securing good progeny '). The wife was to learn the mantras she had to repeat in sacrifices from her father or husband before the husband set up the sacred fires (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1041 n). Gradua lly, the wife lost all importance in Vedic sacrifices and came to be a more silent spectator 7104 of all the weary details that had to be gone through by the sacrificer and the priest, 

In spite of the above restrictions on the wife's powers about Vedic sacrifices many empti rules apply to women also, though the text employs the masculine gender. For example, Mapu XI. 93 provides that a brābmapa, ksatriya and vaisya should not drink surā. This prohibition applies to wives of the mombers of the three varṇas according to the Mit, on Yāj. II. 256. 

The P. M. 8. holds that the gender and number of a word in a vidhitūkya may in cortain casos be intended and insisted on, For example, in PMS IV. 1. 11-16 it is established that the Agni. · somlya animal to be sacrificed in Jyotiṣtoma 88 prescribed in the words 'yo dikṣito yad agnisomlyam paśum-alabhati' (that the person who has undergone dikṣā and offers the animal to Agni and Soma) is only one and that the words in the Aßve medha 'he offers kapiñjalas to the season of 2105 spring', the

kapiñjala birds to be offered are only three (and not one nor two nor more than three ). Similarly, the gender in the passage 'he Bacrifices in the morning in spring an animal with dark coloured neck to Agni, in summer in the noon an animal of different colours, in the autumn in the afternood & white animal to Bphaspati', it is a female animal that is offered because immedia tely thereafter the words they become pregnant' occur. Dharma śāstra works often say that the masculine gender used in many texts excludes women. For example, the Agnipurāṇa 2105 (175. 59-61 ), when dealing with the rules to be observed in all vrataa in general, provides that the person undergoing prata should take a bath, should worship the golden images of the deities of the vratas, perform japa and homa and at the end of the vrata make gifts according to his ability and should feed 24, 12,5 or only three vipras. The N, S. quotes this from Pṛthylcandra and observes that as the masculine gender 'viprāḥ' is employed only males of the brāhmaṇa class are to be fod and not women. 

As against this, when Hemādri 2107 quoting Padma says 'If a woman is pregnant, freshly delivered, or is ill and becomes impure, she should get her vrata performed through another and when she becomes pure she may obseryo it personally,' the N. 8. remarks that this applies to men also when they are impure, since the gender here is not intended to be emphasized. 

There are Mimāmsā rules about the interpretation of words and also about sentences. First a few of the rules about words may be illustrated. (1) Sabara in the very first sentence of his bhāsya propounds the principle that as far as possible the words in the sūtras of Jaimini and in the Veda are to be understood in the sense in which they are understood in popular usage and not in a secondary or technical sense. The same rule is propounded by Jaimini in III. 2.1-2 in connection with the meaning of 'barhis' in the mantra 'I cut the barhis as an abode for gods'. Here the conclusion is that barhis is to be taken in the primary sense of 'handful of kusa grass' and not in a secondary sense

such as kāśa or other kind of grass. Sabara windg up with the 3108 words between the primary and secondary senses of & word it is proper to hold that the primary sense is to be taken for the business in hand'. Again, on L 3. 30 Sabara says 2109 that the words are the same as in the Veda and popular use and the meanings are the same. 

As regards the setting up of Vedic fires, the Tai. Br. I. 1.4 and Ap. Śr. V. 3. 18 prescribe different seasons for men of the three varṇas and add that a 'rathakāra should set up Vedic firog in the rainy season. The question arises whether the word 

rathakāra' in these passages means a person of that casto ( i.e. whether it is to be taken in the popular sense ) or whether it refers to any one of any varṇa who manufactures chariots (i.e. the etymological sense). The established conclusion is that the popular sense is to be taken and not the etymological (P. M. 8. VI. 1. 44-50). In the case of the rathakāra the mantra for ādhāna (setting up of Vedic fires) is ';bhūṇām tva'(Tai. Br. I. 1. 4.8). Though not belonging to one of the three higher varpas, the ratbakāra could repeat that mantra because the Sruti ex prosaly authorized him to do so. but he was not entitled to upanayana. The P. M. S. (VI. 1. 50 ) held that the rathakāra (mentioned in the Tai. Br. and Āp. Śr.) was a caste called Saudhanvana which is neither gūdra nor one of the three higher varṇas but is slightly inferior to them. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 45–46. The S, Kau. argues that 2110 if once the right of a Hindu

widow to adopt is conceded, the more fact that she is not entitled to repeat Vedic mantras in general cannot deprive her of that right and that it is possible to hold, as in the case of the ratha. kara, that she can repeat the specifio mantra required in adop ting a boy. The Tai. 8. IV.5. 4. 2 separately mentions several craftamen such as takṣan, rathakāra, kulāla, karmāra &o. From Atharvayeda III, 5. 6 and Vāj. S. 30. 6 (medhāyai rathakāram dhairyāya takṣāṇam) it appears that the rathakāra held a good position in the then society. 

A word is to be understood in that shade of its meaning that is appropriate to the act in hand. For example, śruti says 'he cuts off with sruva, he cuts off with a knife, he cuts off with the hand' (the same verb'avadyati' being used for all the acts ). The question is whether one is to cut all offerings, whether liquid or solid, whether of flesh or other substances, with sruva ladle or whether he is to employ the method or implement appropriate for each i. e. olarified butter should be taken from & pot and offered by means of a sruya ladle, flesh should be out off with a knife and offered, and hard or thick things (like fuel sticks) should be offered with the hand. The conclusion is that one is to offer in the way most appropriate to each kind of offering. This is called 'samarthyādhikarana'(PMS. 2111 I. 4. 25). The V. M. relies on this when dealing with the homa proscribed by Pitāmāba for all ordeals in the words 'homa should be offered in the four directions with clarified butter, boiled rice and fuel sticks &o' and deolares that the homa of clarified butter should be made with gruva ladle, of havis (i, e. 'boiled rios &c') with Bruc and of fuel sticka with the (right) hand, on account of the fitness (samarthya) of these for the various offerings and sharply criticizes Raghunandana who in his Dāyatattva provided that the homa should be made of all three together (and not separate ly). A similar rule is applied to the ten sacrificial implements

enumerated in Tai. S. I. 6. 8, 2 vis. sphya (the wooden sword), the potsherds &o. Here the Purvapakṣa is that one may employ any one of these for any purposo required in the sacrifice ; the established conclusion (PMS III.1 11. and IV, 1.7-10) is that the enumeration of ten implements is a more anuvāda and is not to be understood as the pūrvapakṣa states, but each is to be employed for the purpose for which the Vedic texts prescribe it (such as one cooks the purodāśa on potsherds, pounds grains in mortar and pastle). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 985 n. 2233 for ton implements of sacrifice and others that are required and p. 1232 above for their disposal. 

One and the same word must not be used in two songos in the same sentence, that is, in the primary sense and also in the figurative sense. 2112 This maxim is relied upon by the Day&. bhāga. When brothers (sons of the same mother) come to & partition, smrti texts (like Yaj. II. 123) proscribe that the mother takes & share equal to that of a son. On this the Dāyabhaga remarks that the word 'mata' (in Yaj. II. 123 and others ) pri. marily means a real mother (janani, that gives birth ) and this smrti rule has no application to the step-mother, since it is improper to hold that the same word once used in a sentence has a primary and a secondary sense at the same 2113 time. But It must be pointed out that all Dharmaśāstra works do not observe this rule. Aparārka ( p. 730) on Yaj. II. 123 (pitur-ārd hyam vibhajatām tātāpyamsam samam baret) includes the step mother under the word 'mātā' following a text of Vyāsa) The Mitakṣarā interpreting Yāj. II. 135 about obstructible heritage stating the order of succession as wife, daughters, parents, brothers, their sons, provides that full brothers first succeed, in default of them half brothers, in default of the last, full brothers'

Maxim of primary and Agurative sense of same word 

1293 

BODA. The V. M. disagrees 2114 with this and says that the word * brother' primarily means 'full brother' and only secondarily "half-brother', that, as it is not allowable to use a word like brother in two sonses in the same passage, in default of full brother his son succeeds (and not half-brother as the Mit. provides). The primary sense of a word is got by abhidhā', the secondary sonde by 'laksaṇā '2115 and sometimes a third sense called suggested sense is said to be due to vyañjanā. These are the three výttis (functions) of a word. 

One of the rules about the interpretations of words is con tained in P.M.S.I. 3. 8-9. Sabara cites three instances of words 7116 viz. caru made from yavas, sandals made of boar skin, a cane mat. The words yava, varāha and vetasa are respectively employed by some people in the sense of 'priyangu' (long pepper), dark bird (crow) and jambu (black berry). The prima facie viow insists that one may use those words in any one of the two senses. The Siddhānta is that those words must be used in the songe in which the Veda (or śāstra) or sistas employ them i. e. the usage of learned Aryan people is to be followed where words

The boy has some of the qualities (90) of fire such as very brown colour and the like and therefore here the word 'fire' is applied to the bor in a figurative sense.

may have two or more sense8. As in several other cases Kumārila doos not like Sabara's explanation and proposes two other explanations, viz. one being that the sūtras relate to the word 'pllu' used in the sense of a tree and mlecchas employ it in the sense of elephant. The meaning of the word in smstis is a tree and that should be followed. Here Śāstrasthāḥ' means 'the sense given to the word in the Sāstra i.e. smsti'. Another meaning he sees into those sutras is the comparative strength of smrti and acāra. This adhikarana is relied upon by Viśvarūpa on Yaj. (1 225) on the question of the primary meaning of the word Śrāddha which he states is 'pipdadana' (offering balls of boiled rice to the manes) and pot feeding brāhmaṇas. The Parāśara-madhaviya refers to Parāśara-gmști (VI. 70-71) about the food cooked from rice in such quantities as measuring an ādhaka 3117 or drona and rendered unclean by being packed by crows or touched by dogs and smelt by 8880s and provides that the measuroa ādhaka and drona were to be taken as those known from sāstras and not those known among mlecchas, 

Another rule (PMS I. 3.10 ) about words is that 2118 words, though of foreigd origin, that are in vogue in Sanskrit, are to be understood in the sonse which they have in the foreign language and one should not think of an attempt to derive them with the help of Nirukta and grammar. Sabara oites four such words viz. pika ( cuckoo), nema (half), tāmarasa (lotus), sata (circular wooden vessel). 

Another rule about words is that where a single substance connected with several attributes is concerned in an action laid down for being carried out, all of these attributes should be taken to refer to the same one substance (PMS III. 1. 12). The Tai. 8. prescribes 'he purchases Souna with a heifer one year old and having brown eyes and reddish in colour'. Here the two words 'piógākṣi' and `ekahāyanl' yield a good etymological meaning, are in the same case and so refer to the same substance

How Soma is to heter. This last is the staken, as reforring to 

(helfer in this 2119 case). But the word arupaya' (of red colour) Causes a doubt viz. whether it should be separated from the other two words in the sentence and taken in the sense of any reddish substance such as a piece of cloth' or whether it should be connected with the verb (he purchases), should thus be subordinate to the purchase and should be taken as referring to the one year old heifer. This last is the established conclusion. How Soma is to be purchased does not follow from any other text. Therefore, in such a case several subsidiaries oan be laid down in one injunction. If 'arunaya' be taken as referring to any red substance such as a piece of red cloth this one sentence would have to be divided into two vidhis 'be should purchase with a red piece of cloth' and 'he should purchase with a brown eyed (heifer) one year old'. This would be a fault oalled 'vākyabheda'. This nyāya is explained by the Madanapārijata pp. 88-89 and Aparārka (p. 1030) makes use of 2130 it in explain ing the correct import of the words of the Br. Up. IV.4.21 "tam etam vedānuvacanena brāhmaṇā vividiṣanti' by saying that when the higbest object in view is one but the subordinate elements are differont these latter are to be lumped together, 

Another rule about words is evolved by what is oalled 'nisadasthapatinyaya' (PMS VII. 51-52). 2121 It is stated that the Isti in which an offering of boiled rice is made to Rudra is

The sentence अरुणया...क्रीणाति is ते.सं. VI. I. 1.6-7. शबर has a very lengthy discussion on this. The तन्त्रवाविक on पू.मी. छ.

For example, प्राद्ध is laid dowa asa विधि but it one wants to lay dowa some matters about माद्ध separate विधि would be required for each matter, such as गयायां श्राद्धं दद्याद, कुतपे श्राद्धं वयाद. But where there is already no vidbi laying down a guga (subsidiary mattor ) there can be one main vidhi embodying several ganas, as laid down in P.M.S.

one that should be performed for niṣada-sthapati. A niṣada is a person born of a brāhmaṇa father and śūdra mother (vido Manu X. 8). He does not balong to one of the three higher Varnas. Sthapati means chief or leader'. The question whether the compound word means 'a niṣada who is a chief (that is a karmadhāraya compound) or whether it means the ruler of niṣadas' who may not necessarily be a niṣāda himself but may be a ksatriya (i, e. whether one should take the word as ' ṣaṣthi tatpuruṣa' as 'niṣādānām sthapatiḥ'). The conclusion is that a karmadharaya is more powerful than a tatpuruṣa, since in the former both the words may be directly connected with tho verb (nisādaścāsau sthapatiśoa, tam yājayet). The V. M. makes use of this maxim'. The Saunaka-smrti authorizes gūdras to adopt & son, yet some writers like Rudradhara, author of Suddhiviveka, held that adoption required a homa with mantras and as a sūdra could not repeat vedic mantras he could not adopt. To this V. M. replies that his power to adopt a son being established by Saunaka's smrti all that is required is that he may get the homa performed through a brāhmaṇa. The Bhāmati on Saṅkarā's bhāsya or V, S.1. 3. 15, where the meaning of the word 'brahmaloka' in Chandogya-Up. VIII.3.2 is in question, says that the nisādasthapatinyaya applies and so 'brahmaloka' means 'brahma as the goal' and not the world of brahma. Manu XI. 54 enumerates five Mahāpātakas (deadly sins), ona of which is 'guryanganāgama' (sexual intercourse with gurtanganā). Commentators have differed about the meaning of this word, some like Bhavadeva in Prayasoittaprakarana stating that, following niṣādasthapatinyāya, the word must be dissolved as a Karmadharaya compound (guruh or gurvi odgau anganā ca), the meaning being one's own mother, while many others dissolve it as a tatpuruṣa compound meaning 'guror or gurūpām anganā' (which would then include a step-mother, an elder brother's wife and teacher's wife &c.). Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 23–25 for a discussion of this.

sentence. Therefore, he and his followers were called 'anvita bhidhānayādinah' as opposed to Kumārila and his followers who beld that words have different SODSON of their own and then they combine in a sentence and yield a further sense of the sentence. These latter were called 'abhihitanvayavadinah:: Vide notes to Sābityadarpaṇa (I., II., X) pp. 86–88 for explana tions of these two terms by the present writer ( ed. of 1956 ). 

Let us now turn to the interpretation of vākya ( sentence). The Rgveda and the Sāmaveda are metrical and therefore there is generally no difficulty in arriving at what constitutes in them one syntactical unit (vakya). But much of the Krsna Yajurveda is in prose. Therefore, PMS (II. 1. 46 ) defines 2133 what makes one vākya by stating that when a number of words serve a single purpose, but if one or a few of those words are separated from the rest, the latter words are incomplete in effecting a purpose and stand in need of the words separated, then all these words make one vākya. An example is the mantra 'I offer thee, that art dear to Agni, at the command of God Savitr with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pūṣan'. This is one sentence, the purpose of which is nirvāpa ( offering ). For other definitions of vakya, vide the author's notes on Sahityadarpana (II. 1) p. 34. For constituting words into a sentence with an understandable meaning expectancy 3123 (akanksa), compatibility (yogyata) and proximity (sannidhi) are required, particularly the first. For example, Saṅkarācārya on V, S. I. 4. 3 says that without ākāākṣā there is no cognition

Vide also 747 on I. 1. 25 (aparat fecurita समाम्नायोऽर्थस्य तशिमित्तत्वात्). The word अर्थ in both sātras means प्रयोजन. Theन्यायसुधा takes the word 'artha' as meaning 'sense' (अभिधेय) in order to give to the sutra a wider scope while Sabara appears to limit it to yajus texts and holds that अर्थ means प्रयोजन. vide also यावन्ति पदान्येक प्रयोजनमभिनिर्वतयन्ति तावन्त्येकं वाक्यम् । शबर on पू. मी..

that the words form a vākya. The word ekavakyatā occurs in V.S. III.4.24 and conveys that there is a twofold akankss vir grammatical as well as psychological. It is the listener or roader who has, on hearing or reading a word, a desire to know another idea or word to get a complete senge. When soveral sentences, each conveying its own sense as far as it goes, are brought together having regard to the fact that one of them may be principal and the others auxiliary, they form one syntactioal whole. This shows that sentences are of two kinds, vākyas and mahāvākyas, as the Sabityadarpaṇa puts it. 

It follows from the definition and the bhāsya thereon that, in order to constitute a vākya, three conditions are nocessary viz. (1) there must be a number of words uttered or put down together (padasamuha), (2) the words must have an expect ancy for each other (i.o. if a word in the collection is dropped no complete sense can be had), (3) all the words must sorve one purpose or convey together one meaning (arthaikatva, 800, to another view). It is not absolutely necessary that the words in order to form a vākya must be in close proximity. Even if some words intervene there may be a sentenco, provided there isaksiksa between the words. Sabara on PMS IV. 3.11 illus trates this well as stated in the note. 3124 In the verso quoted 

paśyasi' is to be connected with jaradgavam', though several other words intervene. Though there is proximity (sannidhi) between 'pinaksi' and 'jaradgavam' they do not form a sentence as there is no capacity as also akānkṣā between tbe two. The upshot is that sannidhi (proximity) of words is generally required to form a sentence, though not necessarily required in every case. 

The different parts of a mantra text, meant to serve different purposes, may be regarded as distinct sentences. For example, the mantra in Tai. Br.2125 (III. 7.5) 'I make an agreeable

Beat (or abode ) for thee (O cake 1), I prepare it as a very happy one with a stream of clarified butter; do sit thereon with pleased mind, be established in ambrosia, O sacrificial essence of rice'. 

Thego are two sentences, the first part being concerned with making a seat, the latter part being concerned with depositing the purodāśa on the seat. Similarly, in the passage 'I (out) thee (O palāsa branch ) for food, I (wash or rub) thee for vigour' there are two different sentences, that are independent of each other, as the Sat. Br. employs those with the words "he cuts the palaba 3126 branch with the words for food (I out) thee', he washes it with the words 'for vigour thee'. The same rule applies to the ten different clauses ayuryajiona kalpatām, prāṇo yajñena kalpatām' in Tai, S. I. 7. 9.%. They are all different sentonces, 2127 

The doctrine of Vākyabheda plays a very important part in Mimārsā as well as in Dharmaśāstra. Vākyabheda literally means 'split of sentences'. When the sentences are equally independent and one sentence does not require or expect words from the other sentence to complete it, they should be treated as separate sentences. This is one sense of Vākyabheda.' Another and more frequent sense of Vākyabheda is as follows: The under lying principle of vākyabheda is that one and the same text cannot be construed as laying down two separate vidhis (pres criptions) or that when a certain matter has already been prescribed and then several auxiliary matters are to be prescri bed, prescribing 2128 all the auxiliaries in one sentence would

give rise to the fault of vākyabheda (syntactical split of sentence). In Tai, S. there is the following passage the sacri ficial post is to be of udumbara tree, the udumbara (tree) is vigour, cattle is vigour; he obtains for him ( the sacrificer) by means of vigour urj ( i. e, by udumbara post) vigour (i. o. cattle) for the attainment of vigour'. This is one syntactical whole ( vākya). If it be said that there is a vidbi prescribing the use of udumbara post in a sacrifice and that there is also another vidhi about the fruit viz. securing vigour (i. e, cattle); this would give rise to vākyabheda. Therefore there are no two vidhis in the sontence but only a vidhi and an arthavada (praise ). 2129 Saṅkarācārya on V. S. III. 3. 57 remarks 'ekam hidam vākyam Vaiśvānaravidyaviṣayam paurvāparyālocanāt pratigate ... eka vākyatāvagatau satyam vakyabheda-kalpanasyānyāyyatvāt.' This is said with reference to the first aspect of the idea of Vākyabheda. 

The basic idea underlying the latter sense of vākyabheda is this. If an act or a substance or a secondary matter has already been the subject of a vidhi and if concerning the act (or substances &c.) a number of other matters (aotions, subs tances &c.) are enjoined in one sentence, there would be vākyabheda (i. e. there would have to be a separate vidhi for each of the other matters relating to what has already been the subject of a vidhi). On the other hand, if an action, substance or a guna is enjoined for the first time along with several secondary matters in one sentence, there would be no fault of vākyabheda i, e, in a single vākya however long or containing many matters, if there is a single vidhi there is no fault. If, in the passage quoted on p. 1258 above 3130 'one desir ing prosperity should offer in sacrifice a white animal to Vāyu', one were to hold that first there is to be a vidhi about prosperity as the fruit or reward, there would be two vidhis and so the fault of vākyabheda, but if one holds that the vidhi is only concerned with offering a white animal and what follows 'vayurvai kṣepiṣ. tha...... bhūtim gamayati' is merely an arthavāda ( praise of the preceding vidhi), there is no vākyabheda.

bheda arises when more vidhis than one are held to occur in the same vākya. 2131 

A few examples must be cited to illustrate the principle of vālyabheda. A sinple example is 'graham sammārṣti'. If one were to interpret this as meaning 'ho is to clean the cup' and also as meaning that only a single cup is to be cleaned there would be vākyabheda. Therefore, it was decided that the singular number in 'graham' is not to be insisted upon and cleaning of all cups was to be resorted to; otherwise there would be two vidhis viz. 'graham sammrjyāt' and 'okam-eva sammṭiyāt'. Sabara quotes (on PMS I.3.3) a śruti 'one who has a son and whose hair is dark should consecrate the vedic fires'. Agnyādhāna is laid down by sruti texts such as Tai. Br. I. 1. 2.6, Sat. II. 1. %. Therefore, the above text only lays down certain subsidiary matters about it. A man may have dark hair but no son or he may have a son when his hair is turning grey. Therefore, if that sentence is meant to prescribe both attributes (having a son and also having dark hair), there would be two distinct vidhis in the same vākya, that is, there would be the fault of vāky& bneda, which has to be avoided. Therefore, that sentence must be understood as indicating a certain age viz. he must not be & mere boy (at the time of agnyādhāna) but of an age to bear & son, nor very old (when hair turns groy ). i. e, he must be neither too young nor too old at the time of agayādbāna. A lakṣaṇā as regards the words 'jātaputrah' and 'kṣṣpakeśaḥ' is resorted to and lakṣaṇā is only a fault as to a word, while vākyabbeda is a fault of a sentence and therefore laksanā should be preferred to vākyabheda. The V. M. quotes (p. 115) the verge of Manu 2132

2132. This text of Manu has been a subject of several conflicting judicial decisions, which are now of no use since there is now a law governing Hindu Adoptions viz. the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 78 of 1956, by section 12 proviso b of which the decisions in 40 Bom. 429 and in some later cases have been set aside. Those interested may read the present author's notes in his translation of the V.M, pp. 121-123 and the footnotes and his paper (Brief sketch of the Purvabimansa system pp. 37-38 (ABORI, vol. VI. pp. 1-40) and also H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 690 697. In Dattatreya V. Govind I.L.R 40 Bom. 429 ( where a person, in whom property had already become vested as the sole surviving male in the family, was given in adoption into another family) it was held, relying op Madu IX. 142, that og adoption that person lost all rights to the property of the

IX. 142 'the son given shall not have (share) the family name (gotra) and the wealth (riktha) of his natural father; the pinda (cake offered to deceased ancestors) follows the family name and the wealth; of him who gives (his son in adoption) the svadha (obsequies) cease (so far as that son is concerned). After citing the above smrti passage 'one having a gon' and another text' for the position of the sacrificial post (vide PMS III. 7. 13-14) with reference to the altar, the V. M. holds that one should not merely emphasize the words gotra, riktha, pinda and svadha used by Manu and take them literally but should hold that the verge contains a lakṣaṇā (indicated meaning ); it indicates the cessation of all those consequences that are due to connection with tbe piṇda in the case of the natural father and Manu says nothing about the property taken by a son before he is given in adoption into another family. 

Another illustration of vākyabheda can be cited from the law of re-union. The Mit., Dayabhāga and Sm. O. (on Vyavahtra p. 302 ) quote & text 2133 of Bṛhaspati that man who being once separated from his father, brother, or paternal uncle again dwells 

(Continued from last page) gatural family that had become vested in bin before adoption. That decision holds that Manu laid down two propositions, viz. (1) a man forfeits by adoption into another family the property that once belonged to the family and that became vested in him before adoption, (2) A person given in adoption into another family does not, after the adoption, take any property of the family to which he belonged bat whose connection with the family ceased after adoption. These are two distinct propositions and to hold that Mano's text is capable of these two propositions is liable to the fault of Vākyabheda. The V. M. (p. 115 ) further relies on the construction of another vedic text 'He fixes half of the yūpa inside the vedi and half outside it.' This is interpreted by PMS III. 7. 13-14, Sabara and the Tantravārtika as merely indicating a certain region for the fixing of the yāpa and that the words are not to be taken literally, because in that case there would be Vākyabbeda. The guyer briags out the meaning clearly. 'समस्तस्य यूपस्थान्तर्बहिर्वा माने माने अर्थमन्तदि-इति नियम्पते। द्वितीयस्थार्थस्य पुनरप्पा नियमप्रसको-अर्धे पहिदि-इत्यपि विधातव्यम् । ततश्चानेकार्थवादास्यभेदो मिनोस्यालया तानुषङ्गलेशव प्रसज्यते । अतश्चेशमबधारणमर्धमन्तरवेयेव न स्वर्धमेवान्तदीति । वथा सति चार्धान्तरमनियतत्वात् कदाचिदन्तरपि प्रामोतीति न पहिवः सिद्धचतीति। ... तस्मादमाम्या विशिष्ट एको देशोऽभिधीयत इत्येवमवाक्यमेवः।

through affection with them (or any of them) is said to be re-united with them (or him. According to the Mit., & reunion is possible only with father, brother and paternal uncle and with no one else, since no one else is mentioned in the text of Bphaspati. The V. M. does not approve of this limitation and says that a re-union is possible with all or any of those that participated in the partition and that the three persons, father, brother and uncle are mentioned only by way of illustration (i. e. there is lalṣanā). A man may separate not only from the three named persons but also from his paternal grand-father, the grandson of his brother and the son of his paternal uncle and Boveral other persons and therefore the construction of the text of Bphaspati by the Mit, is liable to the fault of vākyabheda, since on that interpretation there would be two separate proposi tions viz. (1) that man is to be called ro-united who having become separate again stays together with the one from whom he separated, (2) one can re-unite only with the father, brother, or paternal uncle. Thus there would be two distinct prescriptions in one sentence. Therefore, one should have recourge to laksanā viz. that the three named porsons indicate a class of persons from whom one may have soparated but with whom he then stayed together. The Viramitrodaya (on Vyavahāra), V. R. (pp. 605-67), V. C. p. 533 hold the same view as that of the V. M. 2134 

The Smrtioan drikā provides that after the death of a man when the sons divide, the mother is entitled to a share equal to that of each son if the estate to be divided is not very large, but if the estate be very large she is to get as much only as would be necessary for her maintenance (although Yāj. II. 123 and others employ the words 'samam ansam'). The Madanaratna on Vyavahāra criticizes this as a bad provision on the ground that it is vitiated by Vakyabheda, since there would be two different propositions (vidhis) about the meaning to be attached to the

This text ( Hadele etc. ) is discussed in P.M.S.

words 'samam amsam' (equal share) according as the estate to be divided is large or small. 135 

There is another principle about sentences called 'anuṣanga' (elliptical extension) or the extension of a word, phrase or clause from a sentence to another or other sentences, provided all those sentences are of the same type or form. This is one type of anuṣanga. Another type is where each of two or more sentences appears to be complete by itself, but there are certain words of a subordinate character in the last sentence of a passage which have to be taken up or understood in the preceding sontences. This latter is also called anukar sa. In the three upasads of Jyotistoma, the first 2136 is in honour of Agni in which the mantra is 'yā to Agne ayāśayā tanūr-varṣiṣthā gavharesthogram yaco apāvadhim tvegam vaco apāvadhim svāhā'; the other two Upasads have the two mantras 'yā te Agne rajasaya' and 'ya te Agne harasaya' which are incomplete and in need of complementary words to complete the sentences. The conclusion is that the words 'Varsistha ... SVaha' are to be sup. plied from the first sentence apd not other words from the popular language that one may choose. Another passage of the Tai, 2137 8. is 'cit-patistva punatu, vakpatis-tvā punatu, devas-tva savita punatvacchidrena pavitrena vasoh sāryasya rasmibhih'. Here the first two clauses appear to be prima facie complete, but when we look to the last clause where the word 'punātu' is parti cularised by certain other words, we at once feel that the first two clauses also should be connected with the words 'acchidroṇa... raśmjbhiḥ' and that then they would be quite complete

Principle of anu sanga illustrated 

1305 

The V. M. has a long disquisition on the principle of anuṣanga applied by the Mit. and Madanaratna to the succes. sion to the wealth of one who died re-united. Yaj. II. 135-136 lay down the order of succession to the wealth of a person dying sonless. Yaj, II. 137 deals with succession to the property of a forest hermit, an ascetic or a perpetual Vedic student. The Mit. then holds that Yāj. II. 138 samspstinastu samsrsti' is to be construed as an exception to Yaj.II. 135-136 and understands that the words of one dying without having a son' (grandson or great-grandson) are to be supplied before Yāj. II. 138 from II. 136 (i. e. there is to be anuṣanga of the words 'syaryātasyāputrasya'. The V. M. does not approve of this and states that there is no rational ground for applying the principle of anuṣanga and therefore the order of succession to the property left by one re-united propounded by V.M. becomes different from that of the Mit. The whole discussion is rather abstruse and lengthy and the present writer feels that the space required for exposition should be saved. Those interested may consult the exhaustive notes (pp. 265-275) in the edition of the Vyavahāramayūkha (Poona, 1926) on the passages of the v. M. beginning with the one in the note below. 138 

This principle of apuṣanga capnot apply where words of a different type intervene between the several sentences. For example, when the animal to be offered is killed a long passage occurs which contains the 2139 words 'sam to prāpo vāyunā gaochatām, sam yajatrair-angāni, sam yajñapatir-āśiṣā' &c. (may your limbs be joined to the worshipful deities and may the sacrificer be united to blessing &c). Here the first clause is

separated from the 3rd clause by a clause in which there are two words in the plural while the first and third clauses have two words in the singular; therefore there is no anuṣanga of the words of the first clause into the 2nd and one may employ for completing the sense of the 3rd clause some ordinary word from popular language (and not the words from the 1st clause). 

Veda enjoins many acts such as performing a yāga, casting an oblation into fire, making a gift, milking a cow, melting clarified butter &c, but all are not on the same level. Some aro pradhāna (primary 2140 or principal), while others are guṇa bbūta (subsidiary). The acts denoted by words such as Prayājas by which some substance is not embellished or not made fit or is not produced are primary, while those which produce a substance or make it fit (such as pounding in the case of grains of paddy) are subsidiary. Acts are further classified into Various groups such as nitya, naimiltıka or kūmya or as kratyartha and puruṣartha. These have already been explained. There are six means 2141 by which is ascertained the difference or non difference among acts viz. (1) sabdāntara (different words, such as yajati, juhoti, dadāti, i. o. yāga, homa, dāna are different acts); abhyāsa 2113 (repetition) as in samidho yajati, tanūna. pātam yajati' &o. (Tai. 8. II. 6. 1. 1-%), where the word yajati is repeated five times and therefore there are five different acts prescribed; (3) sankhyā (number ) as in 'he sacrifices seventeen animals to Prajāpati' (Tai. Br, I. 3. 4. 3), which are seventeen distinct acts; (4) guna (an accessory detail suoh as the deity

Means of ascertaining karmabheda illustrated 130% or substance in such a passage as when curda 2143 are put into heated milk it turns into curdlad solid mass āmikṣā which is offered to Visvedevas and the liquid called vājina is to be offered to Vajins, these two being two distinct offerings); (5) prakarana, (context). In the sentence 'one should offer agnihotra' (Tai. S. I. 5. 9.1) there is a vidhi of the daily performance of Agnihotra In the Kundapāyinām-ayana 2144 it is said 'he offers agnihotra for a month'. Since this last oocurs in a different context altogether (while the former occurs in the context of Darsa pūrṇamāsa), this sentence (from Kuṇdapāyinām-ayana) deals with a different act from that of the daily Agnihotra. (6) The name (Sanjñā) also differentiates acts, since they ocour in utpattivākya (originative injunction ) as in the passage quoted jn the note below. 2145 This technique about determining what actions are different on account of the several grounds noted above, was employed by Hemadri, the Kalanirṇaya and the Nirnayasindhu in deciding whether Janmāṣtamīvrata and Jayantivrata are really one vrata or separate vratas. Vide pp. 132–133 above. 

It has already been stated above (p. 1228) that there are four kinds of vidhis of which viniyogavidhi is one. This last conveys the relation between a religious act as principal (seṣin or angin) and 2146 its auxiliaries (angas). This is the concern of the third chapter of the P. M. S., which first defines '$eṣa', states why it is called 'besa', how it is employed in religious acts, what are the means of determining the relation of sega to seṣin and the comparative strength of each of the means.

Some examples of anga and angin may have to be given here. In vribin prokṣati' (he sprinkles rice grains with water) the sprinkling (prokṣaṇa) is an anga (stands in & subsidiary relation to) of rice grains as directly shown by the objective case ( vrihin). The prokṣapa (is motivated by) has the purpose of contributing to the transcendental result (the apūrva), since what is meant is that if, without the sprinkling of water on the rice grains, a sacrifice (yāga ) were performed, apūrva would not be brought about. To take another example, 2147 'he takes hold of the bridle of the horse with (the mantra beginning with ) 'they took hold of the bridle of pta (cosmic order). Here the direct assertion (śruti) shown by the objective case in 'raśanām. shows that that mantra stands in a subordinate relation to (is an abga of) the bridle of the horse, since the utterance of it when taking hold of the bridle of the horse effects a samskāra in the bridle and taking hold is also an anga of the horse bridle (which is in the objective case ), just as prokṣaṇa is an anga of rica grains. 

It has already been stated that sasa' means what subserves the purpose of another' and it is seṣa of that other (P. M. S. III. 1.2. Segah pararthatvāt') and that, according to Badari (III, 1. 3) 'to substances, properties (like reddish colour of a cow). samskaras 2118 ( what makes a person or thing fit for being employed in a yāga or for any other purpose) the word soṣa is always applied, while, acc. to Jaimini (III. 1. 4-6) religious rites are sosa to the result or fruit (expressed or implied), the fruit is sesa to the agent of religious acts and an agent is sega to certain acts. The word “sosa' is often employed by Dharm aśāstra worke. For example, the Mit. while commenting on Yaj. II. 118-119 states that the first half of verse 118 is seṣa to all the rest 2119 ( i. . serves the purpose of the remaining verse and & half).

This view of the Mit. was not shared by several other writers and works such as the Dāyabhāga (VI. 1.8), and Viśvarūpa. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 579-580 for further remarks. 

The P. M. S speaks of six means that are helpful in deter minig, as regards viniyoga-vidhis, what are principal and what are auxiliary when there is a doubt or when there is a conflict, They are śruti (direct vedic statement or assertion), linga (indirect indication), vākya (syntactical connection or relation), prakarana (context), sthāna (place or sequence), samākhyā (sañjñā, name). When several of these come together and refer to the same subject each succeeding one is weaker than each preceding one, since each succeeding one is more remote than sach preceding one from the objective (viz. the viniyoga). P. M. S. III. 3. 14 is called "balabalādhikaraña', 2150 

An example where both śruti and liiga come in conflict is with the Aindri verse (verge addressed to Indra) he should worship the Gārbapatya fire'. The verse addressed to Indra 2151

is 'nivesanaḥ sangamano vagūbām...Indro na tasthau samare pathinām'(Tai. S. IV. 2. 5. 4). Here the doubt arises whether one should worship Indra as the word 'Aindrya' indicates or whether one should worship Gārbapatya (as the passage directly asserts) with a verse addressed to Indra, or whether one should worship both or whether one should worship either Indra or Gārhapatya as one likes. The conclusion is that sruti (direct Vedic assertion) is more powerful than linga. On hearing the words. Garhapatyam upatiṣthate' we are directly told by the Veda about the worship of Garhapatya. The word 'Aindrya' being in the instrumental (as in 'dadhna juhoti'-he performs homa with curds) merely supplies a detail (guna) vix, that the mantra to be repeated is one addressed to Indra and there is no word that directly asserts that Indra is to be worshipped, 2152 Sabara on PMS JIL 2. 4 explains that even Gārbapatya has some of the qualities of Indra and so metaphorically he may be called Indra ( as a brave man is called a lion), since Gārhapatya is & means of accomplisbing yajña like Indra or Gārbapatya may be called Indra from the root 'ind', and may be taken to mean's master or lord'. 

The six means may each come in conflict with all the means that follow each of them. Therefore, there will be five cases of conflict of śruti with linga (which has already been desoribed ) or with vākya, or prakarapa or sthāna or samākhyā; there will be four cases of conflict between lióga and vākys or each of the three ones ( of the means) that follow vakya in the sūtra, ia the same way vākya may be in conflict with prakarapa and the other two (in all three cases), prakarapa may be in conflict with sthāna or samākhyā (i. e. two cases) and sthāna may be in conflict with samākhyā. So that there are in all fifteen cases of conflict of the six means among themselves. We need act

Only Afteen cases of conflict of these six

take into account the conflict of one of the six means with its predecessors, since to say that linga may be in conflict with bruti is the same thing as saying that śruti may be in conflict with linga. Very large space would have to be devoted if all these fifteen possible conflicts are to be exemplified from Vedic and Dharmaśāstra texts. Therefore, the author does not essay that task. 

Dharmaśāstra works often utilize this adhikarana called balabala (PMS III. 3. 14). For example, the Par. M. quotes 2153 & śruti passage that one should perform the daily evening sandhyā adoration of Aditya (the sun) with mantras addressed to Varupa and remarks that “ Vārupibhiḥ" (like Aindryā) is only linga while, Adityam-upsthāya' is sruti ( direct assertion) and therefore the sun is to be worshipped in the evening with mantras addressed to Varuna and refers to the example 'aindrya gārhapatyam upatiṣthate' for support. 

The fourth adhyāya of the PMS deals mainly with the subo ject of prayojya and prayojaka and kratvartha and puruṣārtha. The latter two have been explained and illustrated above (pp. 1232-1235). A few illustrations of the first two may be given. The Prayājas have been declared above to be keratvartha (p. 1233 ). Therefore, kratu ( sacrifice) is the prayojaka ( motivating force ) of Prayājas. The reward (phala, Svarga or the like) is the prayojaka of yāga or & puruṣārtha rite. That is a prayojaka for the sake of which & man is led to perform something by a Vedic exhortatory passage. The sentence is one should offer the Darsapūrṇamāsa saori fice for securing svarga'; therefore the toward ( svarga and the like ) is the prayojaka of Darśapūrṇamāsa-yāga. 2154 The injunction to mix ourde with milk makes a person do so for producing Imikṣā and not vājina, since this latter arises of it

self in preparing amikṣi. Therefore, it is amiksa, being the havis in the Vaiśvadovayāga that is the prayojaka of the Vaiśvadovayāga and vājina-yāga is not the prayojaka of putting curds into milk 1155 (P. M. S. IV.1 22-24). The result is that, if by accident āmikṣā is destroyed, in order to secure the havis (āmiksā ) curds will have again to be put in boiled milk, but if zājin, not being prayojaka, is destroyed, ourds need not be put into boiled milk again, 

Examples of puruṣārtha acts have been given above !p. 1234) such as the Prājāpativrata. This chapter (in 2nd pāda) deals with several cases of pratipattikarma and arthakarma already explained abɔve (pp. 1231-3?). There are certain substanov8, certain embellishments and subsidiary actions with which some phala is associated. For example, it is said (in Tai. 8. III. 7.5.2)'he who has juhū ladle made of parṇa ( palāśa ) wood nover bears an evil word about himself'; 'that he applies collyrium (to his eyes), he injures the eye of his enemy' (Tai, S. VI. I. 1.5); "That he performs the Prayājas and Anuyājas, that is indeed the armour of the sacrifice: PMS declares that these texts about rewards associated with substances, embellishments and sube sidiary acts are really not ridhis about rewards but are more arthavadas, because all these serve the purpose of the principal kratu. 2356 

This fourth chapter (in 3rd pāda) also decides that, al though no reward is expressly declared by Śruti (the Veda) for the performance of the Viśvajit sacrifice, still in the Viśvajit sacrifice ( and in other sacrifices where no reward is expressly mentioned ) syarga is the reward. 2157 

The Viśvajit is a striking sacrifice in which the performer donates all belongings of which he is the owner ("Viśvajiti Barva

Some of the interesting propositions are : the performer cannot donate his own relatives (such as father or mother) but can denote that of which he is real owner or master; that even the emperor cannot make a gift of the whole kingdom, as other people have rights over land and the king protects the people and has only the right to a certain share in the produce of the land; that the performer cannot donate borge8 as gruti expressly forbids the gift of horses in Viśvajit; that the performer can donate only that which exists as his property at the time of giving dakśiṇā in the sacrifice and not that which may become his at a future date; that a sūdra 2159 who waits upon the performer because it is his duty to serve (acc. to Manu) cannot be donated; a person of a higher varṇa cannot be donated; only he who has 112 cows or more wealth is entitled to perform Viśvajit. 

___The 5th adhyaya of P.M.S.deals with krama (the order in which the several component parts or acts that go to make up a sacrifice are to come one after another). Vidhis speak of the performance of many acts in a sacrifice and do not always lay down the order in which those acts (principal and auxiliary) are to be performed. It would not do to perform them in any order that the performer likes. For determining the order of sequence of several acts in a sacrifice one has to depend upon Bir means 2160 viz. sruti (direct assertion as to order), artha

(purposa, suitability ), patha (verbal taxta ), pravztti (commande. ment), kāṇda (place in the texta), mukhya (principal). 

In the Vedic passage about the dikṣā in & saftra, the adbparya, after performing the diksa (initiation rite) on the shapati (the yajamāna, the performer of the sacrifice) performs dikṣā on the brahmā priest, then on udgāt? etc. the Vedic text directly lays down the sequence (by means of the tormination "ty!) that the dīkṣā of brahmā priest cones after the dīkṣā af the yajamāna. In the passage 'samidho yajati tanūnapatam yajati &c. the very order in which the sentences occur in the text (i. e. patha) determines the order of the performance of the Beveral yāgas (PMS V.1.4). The Voda first speaks of the offar ing of Agnihotra and then of the cooking of gruel Here the offering of Agnihotra comes first and preparation of gruel comas after that. But, unless the material to be offered is ready, no Agnihotra offering can be made. Therefore, here the pathae krama has to be given up and arthakrana (order as diotated by the purpose and guitability ) has to be followed i.e. first gruol must be prepared and then Agnihotra offered. 2161 This is an example showing that arthakrama is more powerful than pathakrama (PM8 V.4.1). The Parāśarasmrti lays down that every day one should perform sandhya (morning adoration ), bath, jape (montto ring of sacred texts ), homa, study of the Vedah, worship of gods, Vaiśvadeva and feeding guests. The Par. M. says that 2162 setting aside the pathakrama one must follow the suitability and therefore bath comes first and sandhyā afterwards. The 8m. C. quotes Vṛddhamanu to the effect that a childless chaste widow should offer pinda to her deceased husband and take hia wealth. Hore it is proper to hold that she should first take his wealth and then perform his sraddhas. In the Vajapeya the text says that the performer (yajamāna) has to tie to the sacrifoial post seventeen paśus to be offered to Prajapati (Tai. Br. I. 3.4.

2-3). It is also provided that each of the 17 paśus should have several samskāras performed on it such as proksana (consacra tion by sprinkling sacred water on it), upakarana (bringing near). One may take any of the 17 animals first and begin to perform the first of the samskaras on it; but having once begun with a particular animal he must perform the second and other samakāras one after another on the same animal; 1.o, the order of the samskāras on an animal is determined by the commence ment. Kānda or sthāna is exemplified as follows: The Jyotiṣ toma is the model sacrifice (prakrti) of which Sadyaskra is a vikrti (modification ). It is prescribed by the Veda in the case of Sadyaskra that all animals should be sacrificed together at the savanlya stage. 2163 In Jyotistoma, there are three animals offered viz.'agpisomiya' in the morning, 'savanlya' in the noon and' anubandhya' in the evening. Sādyaskra, being a vikyti, all these have to be performed in it; but the particular text about it provides that all three must be sacrificed together at the savanīya stage. This ( offering all three simultaneously) is im possible and therefore all that can be done is to offer (them) one after another (and not at three different times in the day); it would appear at first sight that the Agaisomiya paśu comes first; but that is not so, since simultaneous offerings being laid down at the savanlya stage in sadyaskrayāga, the advaniya pasu is to be first offered (and not Agnizomiya) and then the Agnizomiya immediately after and then Anubandhya or those two may be offered in any order one likes (but immediately). 

An example of sequence being determined by the mukhya (first or principal ) is : there is a śruti passage 'two Sarasvata, offerings are to be made; this is indeed & divine couple', 2864

Details are provided as ragards the two oiterings to Saragvati and Sarastata. The doubt arisas : ara the details about the offer ing to be made to the female deity to be performed first or are they to be first performed as the offerings to the male deity ? The prima facie. view being that as no sāstra exists rogulating priority ons may do as one likes, the established conclusion is that the order of sequence in the case of the detaile should be determined by the order of the Yājyāpuvākyā verges. These are mentioned first about the fomnale deity in the words 'pra po devi Sarasvati' (Tai. S. I. 8. 22. 1, Rg. VI. 61. 4). Therefore, the conclusion is that in the details also the offering to the female deity should come first. 

In PMS V. 1. 16 it is decided that the order expressed in mantras should be followed in preference to the order contained in Brābmapa texts. 2165 The Darsapūrpamāga sacrifice is made up of three component sacrifices, Agaeya, Upimsu and the Agni somlya. In Tai S. II, 5, %. 3, the Agoisomlya sacrifice is first described and in Tai, II, 6. 3. 3 the Agaeya is described Bat these are held to be Brāhmaṇa texts, though now appearing in the Sambitā toxts, since they lay down a vidhi; but in the Mantra pātha the Agneya mantra 'Agnir-tūrdhā' (Tai B. IIL 5.7.1) is first set out and then follows the mantra Agossomā savedasi (Tai. Br. IIL. 5, 7.2). Therefore, the Āgneya is to be first per formed and the Agaisomlya afterwards. 

If there are several deities or brāhmaṇas to be honoured with several acts or things, or there are several yūpas ( sacrificial posts) as in Aikādasina animal sacrifice on which several Bamskaras are to be performed from anjana to purivyāna (sur 

(Continued from last page) no special ground of choice between the two, holds that the father takes first following certain other smstis like Bphat-Vippu.

The former way is called kāṇdānusamaya and the latter 'padārtbānu samaya ',2166 Jai. V.2.7–9 refers to the first method and Jai. V.2. 1-3 to the 2nd. Vide for the explanation and illustration of these two, H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 739–740, p. 1132 n 2528 and Vol. IV. pp. 441-42 n 987. On Yaj. I. 232 ('apasavyam tataḥ kṣtvā ) the Mit. remarks that the performer of Śrāddha follows the kāṇdānusamaya method for the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas i. e. gives them water for washing the feet, then acamana, seat, sandalwood paste, flowers &o, then he should wear the sacred thread on the right shoulder and offer the upacāras to the pitrya brāhmanas. 

The sixth adhyāya of PMS is a very interesting one. It deals with the various aspects of the question of adhikara, that is, qualifications of the performar of a sacrifice. It is a very exten sive chapter having eight pādas like chap. III and X. A few of the numerous propositions contained therein that have influenced the works ou Dharmaśāstra have already been set out, such as women's right to participate in Vedic sacrifices, śūdra's ineligibi lity for them, the rathakāranyāya and niṣādasthapatinyāya and a fow more will be dealt with here. As a preliminary Jaimini establishes (in P. M. S. VL 1.1-3) that in such texts as *one desirous of heaven should offer the Darsapūrpamāsa sacrifice or one should offer the Jyotistoma sacrifice' the Veda prescribes yāga for one who desires heaven i. e. heaven is the principal (or predominant) factor while yāga is subsidiary or subordi. Date; thereby it follows that the Vedic text lays down the characteristios of the performer. The Pupṭikā says that 1268

adhikari is the owner (or master) who stands above all aotions (vāga). Another more elaborate definition is given as adhikari is one who desires some reward (such as heaven or happiness ). who is possessed of the oapaoity to perform the act prescribed, who has learning and who is not excluded from performing a sacrifice (by Sruti). Even lower animals desire happiness: hence to exclude them the words possessed of the capacity'so. are added. A man may be totally ignorant and so the word' vidvan' is added ; a śūdra may desire happiness, may have capacity and be also learned but he is excluded by the vedio Loxt, Therefore the Sudra is not fit (or ordained) for sacrifice'. 

In VI. I. 39-40 it is established an68 that every man belong. ing to one of the three higher classes has & right to perform Vedic sacrifices. A man though at one time devoid of wealth may acquire wealth by various means. Similarly, it is said in 

VI 1.41 that one who is defective in a limb is just like one who in devoid of wealth i, e. such a man has a right to offer Vedlo Bacrifices provided he takes steps to remove the weakness. In VI. 1. 42 it is further provided that if the defect is congential and incurable, the person who suffers from such a defect is not entitled to perform Vedic sacrifices.

1319 

The ancient and medieval Hindu law of inheritance and BUOopssion was modelled on this. Vide Yaj. II. 140, Manu IX. 201 and Narada ( dāyabhāga, verses 21-22). Yaj. II, 140 declarea that the impotent, the outcast and his son, a lame man, a lunatio, an idiot, a blind man and a person afflicted with an inourable diseage are not entitled to a share, but are entitled to receive maintenance. This subject has been dealt with in of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 610-612. The Mit, on Yāj. II. 140 provides that the grounds of disqualification apply to males and females alike. But the recent Hindu Succession Act (No. 32 of 1956) sweepg away all these grounds of disqualification by providing that no person shall be disqualified from succeeding to any pro perty on the ground of any disease, defect or deformity or, save as provided in this act, on any other ground whatever ( section 28). 

A good many sūtras (in chap. VI. 3. 17-41) deal with what are called 'pratinidhi' (substitute, representative or proxy). These have been described in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 684" 1110, 1203, Vol. III, pp. 471, 637, 653. 654 (where Satyāṣāḍha Śr 8. III containing similar rules is mentioned). A few of them are briefly mentioned here. The first rule is that if the substance declared by the Veda for preparing an offering parishes or is lost as regards an obligatory rite or as regards kāmya rite that is already begun, one should substitute another substance (liks nivāras, wild rice grains ) for vrihi (rice grains) or yava i.e, barley grains and finish the rite (VI. 3 13–17). In some cases Vedic texts presoribe a substitute for the substance required to be used, as in . if he (the performer ) cannot obtain the Soma plant, he should substitute pūtika stalks and extraot juice therefrom.' It is argued by the objeotor that, as the Veda expressly substitutes pātikas for soma, one should conclude that where Voda does not expressly mention & substitute for & prescribed substance, it means that a substitute is not allowed by the Veda in other cases. The siddhanta is that the prescribing of pūtikas as substitute is a restrictive rule 169 vie that although sovoral plants may resemble soma, there is & restriction that only pūtikas should be substituted. It is provided (in III. 6. 37, 39) that when a substitute like nsvāras is employed, the subsidiary aots of sprinkling with water, pounding with mortar and pestle that are performed on rice or barley grains should also be per

formed on them. When rice grains are amployed the mantra expressly speaks of the rice offering as the sap or essence of rios graing. There adaptation (ūha) is to be made an 'pivāranim medha' (vide PMS IX. 3. 1-2). 2170 But in certain cases no substitute is allowed viz. the devatā with respect to which an havis (offering) is prescribed cannot have another substituted iz & rite e. g. 'Agneyoṣtakapālah' cannot be changed into 'aindrostakapālaħ', since in that case the rite will cease to be what was intended. Similarly, when the text says 'be offers into the Ahavaniya fire, one cannot substitute the Gārbapatya fra: another mantra cannot be substituted for the one prescribed por can other sites be substituted for the Prayājas 'gamidho yajati' &c.). 271 

The Veda forbids the use of varakas, kodrains and māṣas as unfit for a sacrifice. If a person mistakenly takes maṣa grains or particles believing them to be mudya graing or particles and uses them in a sacrifice in which an oblation of boiled mudga pulse is prescribed, he will not be performing the desired rita as what is forbidden as unfit cannot be & substitute. 2172 

This pyāya is relied upon by the Mit on Yāj. II. 126 (which simply states that if joint family properties are sup pressed or concealed by some members and kept for themselves, they should be distributed in equal shares even after partition (when this is found out), which holds that this verse cannot be interpreted so as to absolve the concealer of such joint property from guilt simply on the ground that he was himself a part owner and explains that just as a sacrificer mistakenly believing māsa particles as mudga ones loses the fruit of the sacrifice, 80 the concealer of joint property is guilty of wrong. The Vyavahā raprakāśa (p. 555 ) and Aparārka p.732 take the same view, but the Dāyabbāga (XII. 11-13) and V. R. (p. 526 ) are opposed to this ( vide H. of Dh, Vol III. p. 636 ). The Prayasoittatattva p. 482 has an elaborate note on this nyāya.

Another rule is that there oan be no substitute for the performer of the sacrifice (VI. 3.21 ), since (in Jai. TII, 7, 18–20 ) it is laid down that the fruit of the rite belongs to the owner, though after beginning the rite he leaves everything to the priests engaged to perform the rito. The only exception is in the case of satiras ( Jai. VI, 3.22 ) performed by many persons together acting both as performers and as priests. 

One important adhikarana is VI. 7. 31-40, There is a Sattra called 'Viśvasṭjām-ayanam' which is said to last for 1000 samvatsaras. After referrring to Tai, Br. I. 3.7.7 and 1. 7. 6. % (satāyuḥ puruṣaḥ / and to the views of Kārsnājini and Lāvuka. yani, Jaimini boldly establishes the conclusion that sanvat sara here means day. Vide H. of Dh. VOL. II p. 1246 n. 2683 for the Mahābhāṣya stating that the Yājnikas in speaking about such sattras only follow the tradition handed down by ancient Bages. Modhatithi on Manu I. 84 (*vedoktam-ayur-martyānām ) has a long note wherein he refers to the viw of Jaimini, quotos gatāyur vai puruṣaḥ' and also satam-innu sarado anti devā'( Rg. I. 89.9) and oites the views of other interpreters, The Katyāyana Śr. (I, 6. 17-27 ) discusses this very subject at great length, refers to the differing interpretations of Bharadvāja, Kārṣṇājini and Laugākṣi but ultimately holds that samvatsara means' day 'here. 

In the first six chapters of the P. M. S. the procedure of such rites as Darsapūrṇaināsa the details of which are expressly laid down by the Veda has been considered. In the six chapters from the 7th consideration will be given to sacrifices like Aindragna, the procedure of which is not expressly laid down by the Veda 2173 In the 7th chapter what is considered is whether in the vikśtis (sacrifices that are modifications of the model Bacrifices) details have to be added and, if so, which and how many of the details have to be carried out. 

The 7th chapter deals with the general question of the extension or transference of details in general (i. e. atidesa in general) to Aindrāgna and other sacrifices. Atideśa is the

process or method by which the details prescribed in connection with one rite are taken beyond that rite and trapsferred to another. Sabara quotes from some ancient author a sloka defin ing atideśa. The sacrifice from which details are transferred is oalled praksli (model or Archetype ) and the sacrifice to whlob details are transferred or extended is oalled vikrti (or Eotype ). Atideśa may be provided for by vacana (Vedic text) or by the name. The first is of two kinds viz. by a direct statement or by an inferential process. For example, as regards a magio saorifice called Isu the text says, after speaking of some details, that the rest are the same as in 2174 Syena. An instance of an inferential racina is the extension to the Saurya sacrifice of the details of the Agneya in Darsapūrṇamāsa, because both are very closely connected and because no details are prescribed by the text about 'Sauryayāga' (PMS VII, 4. 1). The name also is two-fold, viz. name of a rite and name of a rainskāra. The Māsāgnihotra prescribed (vide PMS II, 3. 24) in Kundapāyi nām-ayana is a different rite from the obligatory Agnihotra (as in 'yāvajjivan-agnihotram jubuyāt') as proved above, but the Dane'agnihotra' being common to both, the details of the usual Agnihotra (such as milking the cow, offering curds or milk, using a Khadira fuel stick &c.) are to be extended to Māsāgai. hotra (Jai. VI. 3.1-4). Extension due to samskāra name is instanced in Jai.VII. 3. 12-15. In the Varupapraghāna (one of the cāturmāgyas), Avabhstha (bath) ia prescribed, but no details are added and therefore the requisite details are to ba taken from the rules about the Avabhștha in Somayāga, 2175 

Atideśa is frequently resorted to by smrtis and digesta. For example, Yāj. I. 236 and 242 extend the procedure of Pindam pitryajña as regards Agnaukarang and offering of pindas to the Parvanaśrāddha. The Parāśarasmrti (VII. 18-19) speaks 176

The 8th chapter deals with specific cases of extension (atideśa). The Darsapūrṇamāsa is the prakrti of all 2171 istis and 'Darsapūrpamāsābhyām yajeta' is called vidhyādi and vidhyanta is the whole procedure of Darsapūrnamāsa (except the originative injunction 'darśapūrnamāsyābhyām yajeta) detailed in the Brāhmaṇas about the offering of purodāsa (cake) &o. In the Vikstiyāga called Saurya 2178 the sontence 'one who desires to secure the lustre of Vedic learning should offer boiled rice to the Sun' is the vidhyadi, but no details are mentioned there, There is an expectation of some procedure and, though there are numerous vidhyantas in relation to sacrifices, the special word \#nirvapati' is indicative of the procedure of Darsapūrnamasa (in which also there is nirvāpa) and one comes to understand that the Saurya caru is offered as in Agneya (the first rite in

2177. Vedic sacrifices are usually divided for convenience into thred varieties, viz. Isti (in which offerings are of mūk, clarified butter, rice, barley and other graiss ), Pasa and Soma and the latter again into Ekaba (lasting for one day like Agaistoma ), Abina (lasting for more than one day up to 12 days) and Sattra (lasting from 12 days to a year or more). Sabara on PMS IV. 4. 20 states that there are four Mabāyajñas, vit. Agaihatra, Dardapāraamāsa, Jyotistoma, Piṇdapitryajāa. There are seven Soma sacrifices as stated by Gaut. Dh. S. VIII, 18. Besides these Srauta rites, there are other rites prescribed in the grhyasūtras, which are offered in grhya fire and seven important ones from which are called pakayajñas, Vide H. of Dh.

Dardapūrpamisa ). The details of the praksti are to be perfor. med in all other iṣtis along with the few details that may have been stated expressly as to some. 

The Jyotistoma is the praksti of all soma sacrifices of one day and of Drādaśābā and its details are performed in all modi fications of soma saorifices such as Atirātra. The Agnisomlya is the praksti of all sacrifices in which a pasu (animal) is to be sacrificed, the details of which are to be performed in all vikstis of pasuyāgas. Dvādaśāha is of two kinds, Ahina and Satira and is the prakrti of all Abida sacrifices like Dviratra, Triratra up to Satarātra; and Dvādaśaba of the sattra type is the model of all sattrag. Gavām-ayana is the prakti of all sacrifices like Adityānān-ayana. Darvihomas are sui juris and are not praktis or vikṛtis of any other saorificos. All these are consi dered in the 8th chapter. 

The 9th chapter deals with tha (adaptation ). When applying the principle of atidesa certain alterations and adapter tions are necessary in the matter of mantras, sāmans and samskaras. The word ūba ordinarily means only tarka or vicaraṇā (reasoning), yet in PMS it has a special meaning. 3179 

The Agneya is the praksli in which the nirvāpa (offering) is to be made with the words 'I offer to Agai what is liked by him'; in the Sauryayāga, which is a vikfti of Āgneya, the offering has to be made with the words 'I offer to Sūrya what is liked by him.' In the Vājapeya we read 'he offers to Bṛhaspati nirvāpa grains cooked on seventeen pans'The Vājapeya is a modification of Darsapūrṇamāsa in which the grains of rice are sprinkled with water; therefore sprinkling has to be done on niyāra grains also (PMS IX. 2. 40). On the 2nd and following days of the Jyotistoma sacrifice there is recitation of the Subra hmanyā litany 2120 addressed to Indra by the Subrahmanya priest, beginning with the words 'Indra āgaccha, bariya āgaccha, Medhatither-mesa &c'. In the Agnistut sacrifice also there is

Adaptation of Subrahmanya-nigada 

1325 

Śgbara thereot, ir those are the Darsap 

Subrahmanya-nigada 1181 addressed to Agni. In reciting it the word 'Agne' is substituted for 'Indra'; but the following words 'Harivaagaccha'is are not to be changed and are to be recited. As they are attributes which may be predicated of Agni also (PMS IX.I. 42-44). The principle deduced by the Mimamsakas seems to be that, only if the words in the original mantra cannot at all be extended to the modified yāga as they stand, thon ūha may have to be resorted to but not otherwise. Sabara however, notes that the 'yājõikas perform ūha (i. e. adapt them by suitable changes) i.e.they recite 'agne agaccha rohitasva brhad-bhano' etc.). It is noteworthy that, according to PMS II. 1.34 and Sabara thereon, a mantra as adapted (whita) is not called a mantra, since only those are mantras 2182 that are recognized as such by the learned. In the Darsapūrpamāsa when the priest takes out four handfuls of grains and puts them in a winnowing basket he repeats over three of the handfuls the mantra which literally means at the command of God Savits, with the arms of Asvins and with the hands of Pūsan I take out for Agni thee that art dear (to him)'.2183 The PMS holds (in IX. 1. 36-37 ) that the words Savity, Pūṣan, Asvin are not to be changed by ūba in the modifications of Darsapūrṇamāsa where the deity to which the offering is to be made is not Agni. Sabara agsigns rather far-fetched meanings to the words Savity, Aspins and Pūṣan ( as in the note below) and says that they are meant to eulogize the laying aside of the handfuls of grains for offering. There is another interesting case where there is no

uha. In the Dargapūrpamāsa there is a praiga (direotion) 'set dowa 2184 the water for sprinkling, put down the fuel stioks and the bunch of kuśa grass, olean the sruc and fruva ladles, gird up the wife of the sacrificer) and come out with clarified butter'. Suppose the sacrificer has two or more wivos. Still the singular *patnla' was to be used and not the dual or plural either in the model itself (IX. 3. 20) or in any modification thereof (IX. 3. 21). Dharmaśāstra works make use of ūha. The Viṣṇu dharmasūtra provides that one should perform Sraddha of one's maternal grand-father and the latter's two male ancestors in a similar way by the ūha of the mantra, 3185 The mantra in the case of the śrāddha of male ancestors is 'Sundhantam pitarah (Ap. Śr. I. 7. 13), which should be changed into 'Sundbantim mātāmabāḥ'; vide Mit, on Yaj. I 254 and H. of Dh. Vol. IV 

p. 513 n. 11428. 

When in a sacrifice boiled rice is to be offered the mantrs Is "ayonam... Vrihlpām medha sumanasyamānah (vide pp. 1898-99 2. 2125 above). If boiled rice is destroyed or not available and nivūra grains are substituted, there is no ūha as 'n vārdpām medha' but the words 'vribiṇām medha' are to be retained (PMS IX. 3. 23–26), because, as stated in PMS VI 3. 27 ( sāmānyam tac-cik[rṣā bi ), olvāras are substituted on acoount of the similarity of parts of boiled nivāras with the parts of rice grains, 

In the third and fourth padas of the 9th chapter there are twelve adhikaranas about the adhrigu-praisa recited by the Hots in Pasubandha Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1121, note 2504 for that praiga. There is ūha to be made about certain wordø therein and PMS explains some of the unfamiliar and difficult words in that text.

the total number of sūtras) just as the third (with 363 sutras ) and the 6th (with 349 sutras) have eight pādas each. This chapter is concerned with badha (annulment or exclusion) and abhyuccaya or samuocaya which is the exact opposite or anti thesis of badha. The general rule is that the details of the prakstiyāga (model sacrifice ) should be taken over in the vikyti (modification). But in some cases the vikṣti-yāga 2186 has a different name, some of the samskāras ( purificatory and embelli abing acts) and some of the substances ( dravya ) employed in the prakrti cannot be extended to the vikstig, because there are express texts negativing their employment or because they serve no purpose or have become useless or senseless. Sabara states that badha occurs when an idea or knowledge determined for certain as this type or that has to be understood as wrong owing to some ( special) reason while abh yuccaya (addition or combination) occurs when even after we have the knowledge that certain matters are to be extended to the vikrti there is the further idea that a few others also are to be additional in the viksti. 

The Mai. 8. prescribes that one desirous 3187 of long life should offer a lump of one hundred krsnalas (golden pieces shaped as grains of rice) heated in clarified butter. But no pounding (avaghāta, threshing) is to be done in this, as the grains being made of gold, there is no chaff which can be separated by pounding (X. I. 1-3). Similarly, no upastarana 2188 (pouring of clarified butter) and abhighāranz (the subsequent pouring of olarified butter) are to be done, since in the model sacrifice these two are done for making the oblation to have a sweet flavour (X. 2. 3-11). A caru of rica has to be boiled (i. e. the heat of fire is to be applied to it). In the same way the golden pieces are to be heated in clarified butter by fire (X. 2. 1-2). The golden pieces have to be suoked like sugarcane pieces (X. 2. 13-16), because they cannot be eaten while in the

model sacrifice idā and prūśitra 2189 are actually eaten. In a magio rite like syena reeds are spread on the ground and not kuśa grass (as in the model sacrifice). This badha is due to a special text. 2190 The general rule in vedio sacrifices is that priests have to be chosen sad da kṣiṇā is to be paid to them at the end but sattras are an exception, since in sattras all are priests as well as performers (yajamānas). Here the exolusion of varuna (choosing) is due to the fact that in the other sacrifices the yajamāna and priests are different and the latter are engaged for fee. There is & visible purpose in select ing or engaging priests, 2191 but in a sattra where ex hypothes all are yajamānas and priests as well, there is no visible purpose in going through the ceremony of choosing priasts (rtvig. varapa). 

One example of gamucoaya may be given. In the Vājapoya (which is said to be a form of Jyotiṣtoma according to PMS III, 7. 50-51 ) seventeen animals are to be sacrificed. In the model sacrifice (i e. Jyotistoma) also there are certain animals to be offered. The question is whether there is badha of the paśus prescribed in the prakstiyāga or whether there is combination (samuccaya). The conclusion is that there is samuccaya (X. 4.6 ), because in the Tai. Br. there ocour passages like this " Tha Brahmavādins say why is it that all sacrificial rites are 

contained in Vājapeye'? He should reply by means of pasus, viz he sacrifices an animal to Agoi, thereby he contains Agaiṣ. toma, he contains the Ukthya &c." This shows that he has to sacrifice also other animals besides the seventeen. 2193 The Mit

on Yaj. III. 243 furnishes examples of samuccaya in the matter of expiations. 

The Tantravārtika ( on PMS III. 3. 14 pp. 859-860) collecks together about three dozen cases of bādha in general not dependent on either the conflict between śruti, linga &o. or not falling under the bādha instanced above. They are 'inference and such appearances as mirage are dispelled by or invalidated by direct perception, deceptive means of knowledge by the six means of knowledge, smrti by śruti, a contradiotory and untrust worthy smrti by a trustworthy and uncontradicted smrti, a smrti with a visible purpose by another with an unseen purpose &o.'. 

There is in the 10th chapter an important topic about dakṣiṇā ( sacrificial fees). In X. 2. 22-28 it is established that dakṣiṇā is to be given not for an unseen purpose ( adṛsta ) but for engaging the priests to perform rites required in sacrifices. In II. 8 1-2 it is established that the yajamāna ( the svāmin ) is to engage priests for sacrifices except where & vedic text expressly directs otherwise (as in Tai. 8. V. 2.8.2). In X. 3. 39 the items of dakśiṇā are set out from Tāṇdya XVI. 1. 10-11; it is held that the words 'dyādaśasatam dakṣiṇā' mean 2193 that the cows are to be 112 (X. 3, 39, 49 ) and in X. 3. 50 it is provided that the yajamān, should himself distribute the fees and X. 3. 55 sets out the method of distribution. All priests are not to receive equal shares. The four principal priests are hot, adhvaryu, 2194 udgāt; and brahmā and each of these four hava three assistants arranged in a certain order set out in the note below.

as fee. Each group of four is assigned 1/4 1. e. 25 for hota and his assistants, the hotā getting 1% and the other three getting reapectively 6, 4, and 3 i.e. they get respectively half, 1/3 and 1/4 of what their principal gets. The same' method applies to the other three groups. The prima facio 2195 viow is that there should be an equal distribition of the fee (cows) as śruti does not lay down any unequal distribution; this is not accepted and it is proposed that the fee should be distributed in proportion to the work done by each. The established conclusion is that both the views are unacceptable and that the distribution should be in accordance with the meaning of the words 'ardhinah, 31% trtiyinaḥ and padinah' employed by Sruti. 

Manu (VIII. 210 ) mentions the method of the distribution of fees in Vedic sacrifices outlined above and extends ita prin ciples of division to men working jointly on such undertakings as the construction of houses &c. 2197 Though the sūtra (samam syād-aśrutivāt) is only the pūrvapakṣa view and not acooptad as to the distribution of the cows as fees in Vedic sacrifices, it has been frequently followed as an equitable rule by medieval Dharmaśāstra writers, The Sm. O. relies on it about the liability of sureties (II. p. 152), about equal shares between father and sons in partition (II. p. 260 ) and U. 285 (distribution of yautaka among unmarried daughters ), II, 404. Kullūka on Manu II. 1 (where 36 years are laid down as the period of studentship for mastering the three Vedas ) states, relying on the sūtra 'samam' &o. that thirty-six years should be equally distributed over the three Vedasākhas.

Rute of equal distribnition quotes both verses of Madu (VIII. 210-11), then quotes Manu VII, 210 (on p. 213) and explains and then sets out the distribu tion of the dakṣiṇā if it was 112 cows. The Vyahāraprakāśa pp. 449 and 548 (on division of mother's yautaka stridhana by unmarried daughters ) refer to the rule of equal division. Most of those works (as printed) read the sūtra as 'samam syādasru tatvāt' and not as Jaimini and Sabara read. 

The eleventh chapter deals with tantra which embraces Cases where one aot serves the purpose of several other acts or rites. 2198 For example, there are three yāgas viz. purodāsa (cake) baked on eight potsherds for Agni, ourds for Indra and milk for Indra; one performance of the Prayājas serves these three (XI. 1.5–19 and XI. 1. 29-37). Adhana ( establishment of the sacred fires) is to be done only once and is not to be repeated in each iṣti, pasuyaga or somayāga (XI. 3. 2); the utensils required for Srauta rites are prepared only once and are to be kept till the death of the sacrificer (XI. 3. 34-42). 2199 All these are oases of tantra. The general rule is that the place, time and the per former as regards all principal matters in one composite rite such as Agneya and others in Darsapūrṇamāsa are one (XI. %. 1) and also that they are the same for angas (details); but in the case of the angas (details) the place, time and the performer may be different on account of express texts. 

If the fruit or result (phala) follows from all the component sacrifices collectively, then the subsidiary details have to be

performed only once and not separately in the 04se of each component; this is tantra. But if the result follows from each of the component sacrifices geparately, then the subsidiary details should be performed with each one of those componente. That would be a case of āvāpa ( decentralisation or goattering). In the Darsapūrṇamāsa there are really two sets 2200 of saori fices, one called Darsa (on amavasya) and the other Parnamase. The subsidiaries prescribed for each are almost the same. Yet they have to be repeated with each of the two sets, the principal reason being that the two are performed on two different days separated by a fortnight, though the two sets together make one single sacrifice leading to a single fruit. Vide PMS XI, 2, 12-18 which is a case of ārāpa. 

The Aveṣti is a sacrifice which is performed as part of the composite sacrifice called Rajasūya that could be performed only by Kṣatriyas. It is also an independent sacrifice that could be performed by any one of the three higher varpay. This is no part of the Rājasūya and is different from it, though the passage about it occurs in the midst of the description of Rajasūya. 2201 This is relied upon by the Nirpayasindhu in connection with the Navaratra from Āśvina 1st to 9th of the bright half. There were different views, vir. Devipuja was to be performed for 9 days or on 8th or 9th tithi (vide above p. 154). The Kalika purana quotes 2202 a verse about Devipuja on the 8th or 9th alone of Asvina (sukla) and the N. S. interprets it as a separate wor ship on 8th or 9th alone distinct from the whole Navaratra.

Sense of " rājā' in the Avesti text 

1333 

The game adhikarana where the Pūrvapakṣa proposes that Raja means any one of any varpa who rules over a kingdom and oftere protection to the country and its cities, the siddhānta (PMS and Sabara) holds that 'rājā' is a word expressive of a caste Viz. Kṣatriya, and this is referred to by several late Dharmasastra works like the Rājadharmakaustubha (p.5). The V. P. refers to this adhikarana and interprets the verse of Nārada viz. 'one who is an apostate from the order of ascetics would become the slavo of the king' as providing that even a ksatriya apostate would have to be the slave even of a vaisya ruler, though the word 'rājā' in the primary sepse means a kṣatriya yet in a secondary senge (lakṣanā) any one who protects subjets could be called rājā. The Par. M. discusses this adhikarana at great į length (1. 1. pp. 449–55). It may be noticed that the meaning of rājā' as kṣatriya in early texts changed to any ruler of any class who protects the country and people ruled over by him, This change is brought out briefly in Tantravārtika on III. 5.26. 

The 12th chapter deals with the topics of prasanga, vikalpa and the like. Prasanga occurs when something done in one place is helpful in another place also, just as when a lamp is lighted in a mansion it illumines the public road also. 2203 In connection with the Agnisomlya animal sacrifice an offering of pasupurodāsa (a cake of the meat of the animal sacrificed) in the words 'having offered the omentum of the animal to Agoi and Soma one offers & pasupurodāsa oooked on eleven potsherds to Agni and Soma'. The question is whether the details such as prayājas should be performed afrosh for this ar whether those details performed at the time of offering the omentum will suffice. The established conclusion is that the details already performed at offering pasu (amentum) will serve for the offering of the meat oake also, 2204 In such cases the place or time and performer are to be the same. This conclusion is relied upon in the Prāyasoittaviveka which says that when & man performs the expiation for twelve year in connection with grave sins of

Vikalpa has already been dealt with above (pp. 1249-1252 ). 

The preceding pages are enough to exhibit the main doctrines and some of the principal Mimāssā rules of interpreta. tion and the great influence that the Mimāmgā exercised for over two thousand years on Dharmaśāstra works from the Āpastambadharmasūtra to late medieval works like the Smrti tattva, Nirgayasindhu and Vyavahāramayūkha. An exhaustive treatment of the numerous technical torms, topics and principles of the mimāmgā would easily cover a thousand pages, would enormously add to the extent of this work and has to be given up here for reasons of space, if for no other reason. 

The Mımāmsā rulas have been of considerable help to Dharmaśāstra writers. But it should not be supposed that application of the Mimāmsā rules is easy or that the rules always enable scholars to arrive at agreed or certain and definite conclusions. Apart from the schism betweon the Prābhākara and Bhātta schools already referred to above (on p. 1189 ) there are many circumstances which militate against the certainty and Usefulness of mimaṁsā conclusions. There are variant readings in the sūtras themselves (0. g. on I. 2. 9 there are three readings according to Tantravārtika p. 123, on 1 . 14 two readings &ob. to Tantrav. pp. 128–129). Sabara omitted the sutra II. 4. 17 (vākyāsamavāyāt) and the Tantravārtika notes (pp. 895-897) that Sabara omits six sūtras after IIL. 4. 9. Sabara frequently mentions a predecessor called Vrttikara with great respect but differs from him in some cases (e. g. on I 1. 3-5), does not like his way of dealing with sūtras like II. 1. 32, 33 and VIII. 1. %. Sabara gives alternative explanations of the same sūtra (e. g. of I. 3. 4, VII. 4. 13, VIII, 1. 39). Sometimes he treats two or more sūtras as forming one adhikarana and alternatively treats one of them as forming a separate adhikarana (as in 1, 3.3, II. 2. 23-24). He proposes more than two explanations of the same sūtra viz. IV. 1.2. He puts forward two or more explana tions of the same adhikarana (as in IV. 3. 27-28, VIII. 3. 14-15 ___2205. एवमतुल्यरूपेषु पापेषु समानजातीयेषु विजातीयेषु वा गुरुपापोदेशेन वा वार्षिकादिरूपमायश्चिचे कते स्वल्पपापाना परोडाशयावेन प्रसहादेव कालिदेलाववादम The Tartautoernali 94. . p. 85.

On Visayo prāyadarsanāt' II. 3. 16 Sabera himself is at a loss as to what the doubt intended by the sūtrakāra is or what the sūtrakāra wants to establish and relies upon what the vittikāra says about the passage to be discussed and about the doubt that arises. Besides, Sabara and Kumārila differ about the subject matters of certain adhikaranas as in 1. 3. 3-4 ( where Kumārila gives on pp. 194-195 a different interpretation altogether after first accepting Sabara's view ), 1. 3. 5-7, I. 3. 8-9, I. 3. 11-14. Kumārlla shows scant respect for Jaimini by naming him without the honorific title 'bhagavān' or 'ācārya' on pp. 495, 650, 655, 895, charges Jaimini with composing sūtras not containing much substance (p. 895) and remarks that Jaimini's sūtra is improper or wrong (e. g. vide p. 1241 about IV. 2. 27). 

Kumarila is often critical of Sabara's bhāsys and remarks dozens of times that the bhāsya is improper (ayukta) or deserves to be discarded, is unmeaning or absurd (asambaddha) as on pp. 165, 30% (upeksitavya ), 313 (asambaddha), 314, 66%, 710,731, 863 (asambaddha), 950,953, 1090–91, 1615 (bahavo doṣah), 1714, 1980, 2004, 2193, 2204. 

Another circumstance that makes one entertain grave doubts about the universal validity and usefulness of the principles evolved by the PMS system must also be adverted to. The greatest students of Mimārosā arrive at entirely different conolusions on many points. Some striking cases may be referred to here. One of the most glaring of such cases is the interpretation of the short sūtra of Vagiṣtha 2206 (15. 5, na stri putram dadyāt pratigrhniyād vā anyatrānujñādbhartuḥ) 'a woman should not give or take a son in adoption except with the asgent of her husband.' This has been interpreted in four different ways by works and authors about a Hindu widow's power of adopting a son. The Dattakamimāṁsā holds that no widow can adopt a son, because, the husband being already dead, no assent of his can be had at the time of adoption. Vāoaspati,

1336 





& Maithila writer, was of the same opinion on the further ground that, as Vasiṣtha lays down that one about to take a son in adoption should, after having performed a home in the middle of his house with the vyāhrtis, take (in adoption) only him who is closely related and who is a kinsman and not remote (in habitation &c.) and, as women cannot perform a homa with Vedic mantras, all women including widows have no power to adopt. But in Bengal, it was held that the husband's assent need not be given at the time of adoption and that it may be given long before the actual adoption. In Madras it was held that the word husband in 'except with the essent of the husband' is only illustrative and that therefore the angent of the agnates of the father-in-law (husband's father ) or of the husband's agoatos would be enough to enable a widow to adopt. The Vgavaharama yūkha, 2207 the Nirnayasindhu and the Samskara-kaustubha hold that the absent of the husband is required for a woman whose husband'is living and that a widow can adopt provided she has not been forbidden to adopt by her husband. For a detailed pre sentation of these four views and the case law, vide H. of Dh. vol III, pp. 668-674. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (No. 78 of 1956 ) bas made far-reaching and radical changes in the Law of Hindu adoptions and section 4 of that Act overrulos all texts, rules or interpretations of Hindu Law or customs and usages as part of that law, except in so far as they may have baon expressly saved by that Act. 

The Mitākṣarā and the Dāyabhāga, both steeped in Mimārsā lors, differ on numerous points, some of which are (1) The Mit. holds that property or ownership arises by birth, the Dayabhāga denies it and says it is on the death of the previ ous owner or by partition; (2) superior right to inherit depends on religious efficacy according to the Dayabhāga, wbile nearno88 of blood relation is the determining factor according to the Mit; (3) Members of a joint family hold family property in quasi severalty and can dispose of their shares even before partition according to the Dāyabhāga; the Mit does not say 80; (4) 800. to Dāyabhāga even in a joint family a widow succeeds to her husband's share on his death without male issue, while the Mit. does not accept this view.

Several explanations of same word or words 

1897 

One may note the great cleavage of opipion (above p. 1230) on such texts as Yaj. I. 81 (whether there is a vidhi or a piyama or parisankhyā); in note 2111 (p. 1291 ) between the V. M. and Raghunandang both great Mimāṁgakas; in note 2113 p. 1292 on the interpretation of the word 'mātr' by Aparārka and the Dayabhāga; on pp. 1302-3, notes 2133–34 above on Bphaspati's Verso on re-united coparceners. 

In passing it may be stated that to oall the Act Hindu Adoptions Act' is a travesty and misnomer, It should have simply been called the Law of Adoptions in India and should have retained the ancient Hindu rules for Hindus as developed by the courts and should have been of a permissive character for all Indians like the English Statute (of 1926) on the adoption of children. The general Hindu law of adoption as developed in the authoritative smrtis and commentaries and the case law did not contemplate the adoption of a daughter (except when she was made in ancient times a putrikā) and to allow the adoption of a daughter when & Bon was living throws to the winds the basic priniciple of the Hindu Law that a sonless man should adopt & male as & son for the sake of the presentation of piṇdas and water ( to the Manes) and for continuance of the family name ( sections 7 and 11 of the Act). The Act allows a woman (even if not married) to adopt to herself a son or daughter or both and under it a woman, if married, can adopt a daughter even if she has a son but a married woman cannot adopt a daughter if she has already a daughter or a son's daughter living at the time of adoption (sections 8 and 11). The Act does not recognize dvyāmusyāyang adoptions which were recognized by Sanskrit texts and also by judicial decisions. The ministers in the Govern ment and their followers ( most of the latter hardly know what Hindu Law was and has beon) were carried away by enthu siasm for equality of rights for both mon and women. As the Indian Union is now a welfare State and it is professed that laws are to be made keeping in view & socialistic pattern, Govt. should have disallowed adoptions altogether or at least put great curbs on indiscriminate adoptions. Instead, they extended the scope of adoption among Hindus by allowing a man to adopt a daughter even when he bad & son or sons and by allowing even unmarried women to adopt a son or daughter or both. This is against a socialistio pattern. If adoptions had been disallowed entirely or allowed within Darrow limits oases of escheat to Government for want of heirs would have been many and to that

extent a socialistic pattern would bave been advanced. There is no evidence to show that women were keen on the right to adopt & son or daughter even when they were unmarried. The first prinoiple of introducing reforms in the existing law is that only strictly necessary changes should be put forward. Reformers and legislators should take to heart the advice of Mr. Aldous Huxley (in Ends and Means,' p. 30) that change as such is more or loss distressing to most human beings, that man's conser vatism is a faot in any historical situation and that social refor mors should abstain from making unnecessary changes or changes that are of startling magnitude. Legislators should not forget that when they introduce far-reaching changes to lessen hardships, real or supposed, deemed to be caused by exist ing social conditions, they very often create new problems fa the immediate future. To take a simple example, under the old Hindu Law all girls were to be married before puberty, though Manu (IX. 90 ) provided that a girl should wait for three years thereafter during which, her parents or relatives might select a bridegroom for her, but that if they failed to do so she may herself choose her partner. This was not a bad provision People however went in for child marriages for girls and the problem of spinsters never aroge. Thep over thirty years ago came the Child Marriage Restraint Act (XIX of 1929 ) whereby the legally allowed marriageable age for girls was fixed at 14. By subsequent amendments and by the Hindu Marriage Act (25 of 1955 ) the lowest marriageable age for girls is now fixed at 15. This Act of 1929 originally went a long way in raising the minimum age for the marriage of girls. Then, after the second world war, owing to economic stringency, and other factors, the tendency of marrying at a late age inoreased and now the problem of spinsters among Hindus has emerged and great difficulties about the marriages of grown-up women in middle class families are being experienood.Appendix to Section VII Chap.

A Vedic text states that vessels made of Varana and Vaikankata wood are fit for sacrifices, but a vessel of Varana wood is aot to be used for homa while one of Vaika kata cay be used. Both classes of vessels are subsidiary to sacrifices, but the text about not usiog Varana vessel in boma is of a gencral character. Therefore, one of the two clauses is not subordinate to the other, Hence Vaikankata vessels are to be used in yāgas in which homa is
