CHAPTER VII 

UPANAYANA 

This word literally means 'leading or taking near'. But the important question is 'near what'? It appears that it originally meant 'taking near the ācārya' (for instruction); it may have also meant 'introducing the novice to the stage of student-hood'. Some of the grhyasūtras bring out this songe clearly e. g. the Hir. gr. I. 5. 2618 says "The teacher thon makes the boy utter 'I have come unto brahmacarya. Lead me near (initiate me into it). Let me be a student,- impelled by the god Savitr'". The Mānava and Kathaka gr. ( 41.1) also use the word upāyana for upanayana and Adityadarśana on Kāthaka gr. ( 41. 1 ) says that upānaya, upangyana, mauñjibandhana, batukarana, vratabandha are synonyms. 

A few words about the origin and development of this most important samskāra would not be out of place here. Compe rison with the ancient Zoroastrian scriptures ( vide S. B. E. vol. V. pp. 285-290 about the sacred girdle and shirt) and the modern practices among the Parsis of India tend to show that Upanayana goes back to an Indo-Iranian origin. But that subject is outside the scope of this work. Confining ourselves to Indian Literature, we find that already in the Rg. X. 109.5 the word 'brahmacari' occurs 'oh gods he ( Bṛbaspati), all pervading one, moves as a brabmacārl pervading all (sacrifices); he is only one part of the gods ( i. e. of sacrifices ); Bphaspati secured by that (i. e. by his service to the gods ) & wife (me who am named) Juhū, who was (formerly ) taken by Soma', 617 The

Upanayana 

word 'upanayana' 818 can be derived and explained in two ways: (1) taking (the boy) near the acārya, (2) that rite by which the boy is taken to the acārya. The first sense appears to have been the original one and when an extensive ritual came to be associated with upanayana the second came to be the sense of the word. Such an ancient work as the Ap. Dh. S. I.1.1. 19 says that upanayana is & Barnskāra (purificatory rite ) laid down by revelation for him who seeks learning (i. e. it accepts the second explanation) or this sūtra may mean it is a samskāra brought about by imparting the śruti ( viz. Gāyatri mantra ) to him who seeks learning'. This would mean that upanayana principally is gāyatryupadeśa ( tho imparting of the sacred Gāyatri mantra), This appears to be suggestod by the Vedic passage quoted above ( 154 f. n. 356) 'he created the brāhmaṇa with Gāyatri, the ksatriya with Tristubh, the vaisya with Jagati', and by Kātyāyana Srauta 'one should initiate the brābmana with Gayatri'. Jaiminists also (in VI. 1.35) propounds the view that upanayana is a samskāra and has a seen result viz, thereby the boy is brought near the teacher for learning Veda, 

Rg. III. 8. 4 620 is a verse that clearly indicates that some of the characteristics of upanayana described in the grhya sūtras were well known even then. There the sacrificial post (yūpa ) is praised as a young person ( i. e. in the language of the later classical rhetoricians there is the first kind of the figure Atisayokti)" here comes the youth, well dressed and encircled (the boy by his mekhala and the post by its rasana); he, when born, attains eminence ; wise sages, full of devotion to the gods in their hearts and entertaining happy thoughts, raise him up'. Here in 'un-nayanti' we have the same root that we have in upanayana. This mantra is employed in the upanayana by several grhya sutrase. g. Asv. I. 20. 8 (who employs it for

making the boy circumambulate) and Pār. II. 2. (presoribes that the mantra is to be recited when tying the girdle round the boy's waist). In the Tai. 8. VI.4) 3. 10.5 we have the famous passage referring to the three debts where the words 'brahmacārl' and 'brahmacarya' occur. 'Every brāhmaṇa when born is indebted in three debts viz. in brahmacarya to the sages, in sacrifice to the gods and in offspring to the manes; he indeed becomes free from debts who has a son, who sacrifices and who dwells ( with the teacher) as a brahmacārl.' 

In the other Vedas and in the Brāhmaṇa literature there is ample material to show what the characteristic features of upanayana and brahmacarya were. The whole of Atharvaveda XI. 7 ( 26 verses ) is a hymn containing hyperbolical laudation of the brahmacāri (Vedic student) and brahmacarya. The very first verse 688 may be cited as a sample The brahmacāri incessantly covering ( the world by his glory ) roams in the two worlds; the gods have the same thoughts ( of grace and favour) about him; he fills his teacher by bis austerities'. Verse 3 says 'the teacher leading ( the boy ) near him makes the brahmacāri like unto a foetus' (here the word 'upanayamānaḥ' occurs ). Verse 4 states that the heaven and the earth are the samidh' (the fuel stick) of the brahmacārl and that the brahmacārl by his mekhalā (girdle), by his samidh and by his life of hard work fills the world with austerities. Verse 6 tells us that the brahmacārl wears the skin of a black antelope and has a long beard; verse 13 says that the brahmaoāri offers samidh into fire (or if fire is not available) to the sun, to the moon, to the wind or into waters. This hymn thus brings out most of the characteristio features of the brahmacārl-and of upanayana ( viz, deerskin, mekbalā, offering of samidh, begging and a life of hard work and restraint), From the reference to the beard and from the words 'this man (ayam purusah)' occurring in the Atharvaveda VIII. 1. 1 and elsewhere it appears probable that upanayana was performed rather later in those ancient days than in the days of the gutras.

Upanayana 

___ In the Tai. Br. III.683 10. 11 there is the story of Bharadvaja who remained a brabmacāri for three parts of his life ( i. e. till 75 ) and to whom Indra said that in all that long period of brahmacarya he had mastered only an insignificant portion ( three handfuls out of three mountains) of the Vedas, which were endless in extent. The story of Nābhānedistha, son of Manu, who was excluded from ancestral property at a partition made by his brothers, narrated in the Ait. Br. shows $24 that he was a brahmacāri staying with a teacher away from his father's place. The Sat. Br. XI. 5. 4, contains many and almost complete details about the life of brahmacūrins which bear & very close similarity to those taught in the grhya sūtras. A brief summary is set out below. The boy says 'I have come unto brahmacarya' and 'let me be a brahmacāri'. Then the teacher asks him ' what is your name'; then the teacher takes him near (upanayati); the teacher takes hold of the boy's hand with the words ' you are the brahmacārt of Indra; Agni is your teacher, I am your teacher, N. N. (addressing the boy by his name)'. Then he consigns the boy to (the care of ) the ele ments. The teacher instructs him ' drink water, do work (in the teacher's house ), put a fuel stick (on the fire), do not sleep (by day). He repeats the Savitri (mantra sacred to Savitr). Formerly it was repeated a year ( after the boy came as a brahmacari), then at the end of six months, 24 days,12 days, 3 days; but one should repeat to the brāhman, boy the verse at once ( on the very day of upanayana ); the teacher repeats it to him first each pada separately, then the half and then the whole. Being a brabmacāri one should not eat honey.625

The word antevāsl' (lit, one who dwells near a teacher ) ooours in the Say. Br. V.1.5, 17 and in the Tai, Up. I. 11. The Sat. Br. (XI. 3. 3. 2) say8626 'he who takes to brahmacarya indeed takes upon himself a sacrificial session of long duration.' It further says ( XI. 3. 3. 3-6 ) that the boy when entering upon studentbood approaches giving a fourth part of himself to Agni, Death, the teacher and himself and that by the offering of Bamidh ( to fire), by begging and by doing work in the teacher's house respectively he secures freedom from the action of the first three. It also says that after one finisbes studenthood and takes the ceremonial bath one should not beg. Vide Gopatha Br. (ed. by Gastra ) 2, 3 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 53. The Sat. Br. (III, 6. 2. 15 ) further says therefore brahmavāring protect the teacher, his house and his cattle, with the idea that otherwise he might be taken away from them'.827 

Janamejaya Pārikṣita asks the hamsas ( who were the Abavaniya and Dakṣiṇā fires ) what is holy' and the latter reply 'It is brahmacarya'(vide Gopatha Br. 2.5). Gopatha (2.5) further says the period of studenthood for the mastery of all Vedas is 48 years, wbich, being distributed among the Vedas in four parts, makes brahmacarya last for 12 years, which is the lowest limit; one should practise brahmacarya according to one's ability before taking the ceremonia1628 bath,' The same work says that the brahmacāri should fetch gamidhs every day for worship ping fire and beg and that if he does not do so continuously for seven days he has to undergo upanayanı again (2. 6) and that the lady of the house should daily give alms to a brahmacarin with the idea that he may not deprive her of her wealth, of merit due to iṣtāpurta. It also says that a brahmacāri should not sleep on a cot, should not engage in singing and dancing, should not roain about, should not spit about nor go to a cemetery.629

Upanayana 

275 

It appears from the above and from the Upanigad pagsages set out immediately below that originally Upanayana was a very simple matter. The would-be student came to the teacher with a samidh in his hand and told the teacher that he desired to enter the stage of studenthood and begged to be allowed to be a brahmaoirl living with the teacher. There were no elaborate ceremonies like those desoribed in the grhya sutras. The word brahmacarya occurs in the Katha. Up. I.1.15, Mundaka II. 1.7, Chandogya VI. 1. I and other Upan iṣads. The Chandogya and the Br. Up., probably the oldest among the Upaniṣads, furnish very valuable information. That some ceremonies were required before a young boy was admitted as a student even in Upaniṣadio times is clear from the statement in the Chāndogya V. 11. 7830 that when Aś vapati Kekaya was approached by Prācinagala Aupamanyava and four others who carried fuel in their hands (like young students) and who were grown-up householders and theologians, 'ho ( Asyapati) without submit ting them to the rites of Upanayana began the discourse'. When Satyakāma 631 Jābāla tells the truth about his gotra to Gautama Hāridrumata, the latter says 'fetch, dear boy, fuel, I shall initiate you. You have not swerved from the truth(Chāndo gya IV.4.5). Similarly in the Bș. Up. VI. 2. 7. it is said that foriner students ( i. e, students in former ages ) approached (the teacher for brahmacarya) only in words (i. e. without any further solemn rite or ceremony ).638 In the most ancient times it is probable that the father himself always taught his son. 6831 But it appears that from the times of the Tai S, and the Brābmaṇas the student generally went to a guru and stayed in his house (vide note 624 about Nābhānediṣtha ). Uddalaka Aruni who was himself a profound philosopher of brahma asks his son Śretaketu to enter upon brahmacarya and sends him to a teacher to learn the Vedas. 686 The same Upaniṣad describes the

asrama of brahmacarya ' dwelling as a brahmapārl in the house of a teacher, mortifying his body in the house of his teacher till his 888 end'. Chāndogya IV. 4. 4. shows that the teacher asked the pupil his gotra ( in order that he may address him by that name ). The same Upaniṣad shows that the brahmatāri had to beg for food (IV. 3. 5), that he had to look after the fire of his teacher (IV. 10.1-2) and that he had to tend his cattle (IV. 4. 5). The age when upanayana was performed is not expresaly stated in the Upaniṣads except in the case of Svetaketu who was 1% ( vide note 634 above). The period of student-hood was usually twelve (Chandogya II. 23.1, IV, 10.1, V1.1.), though the Chāndo gya ( VIII. 11. 3 ) speaks of Indra's brahmacarya for 101 years and Chandogya II. 23. 1. speaks of brahmacarya for life. 

We shall now turn to upenayana as described in the sūtras and smstis. The following matters fall to be treated under Upanayana: The proper age for upanayana, the auspicious Beasons for it; the skin, the garments, the girdle and the staff for the brahmacārins of different varpās; the yajñopavita ; the preliminaries of upanayana, such as homa, taking of curds by the boy, afjalipūraṇa, aśmārohana; the principal rites of upanayana viz. taking of the student's hand by the teachers touching the chest of the student expressive of acceptance as pupil, banding the boy to Savits and other gods (paridana), instruction in the duties of the student (such as putting fuel on fire, begging &o.), instruction in the famous Savitri mantra ; iedhājanana; study of the Vedas and daily recitation of Vedic texts; special vratas of the brahmacāri; Patitasūvitrika (those whose upanayana has not been performed at all) and rules about them. These matters will now be dealt with in order. It should be remembered that all these matters are not dwelt upon by all the smrtis nor are they treated of in the same order. Further the Vedic mantras often differ in the different sūtras. 

The proper age for Upanayana The Aśv. gr. 638 (I. 19. 1-6) says that a brāhmaṇa boy should undergo upanayana in the eighth year from birth or from conception, a kṣatriya in the 11th year, a vaisya in the

12th and that to the 16th, 22nd and 24th years respectively for the three varnas it cannot be said that the time for upana yana has passed. Ap.887 ( 10.), Sān. (II. 1), Baud. (II. 5. 2) and Bhār. (1.1), Gobhila (II. 10. 1) gphy& sūtras, Yāj. I. 14, Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 19 expressly say that the respective years are calculated from conception. The Mahābbāṣya 688 also refers to the rule that a brāhmaṇa's upanayana is to be performed in the 8th year from conception. Par. 38 gr. (II. 2) allows upanayana in the 8th year from birth or conception and adds that in the case of all varnas family usage may be followed. Yāj. I. 14 also refers to family usage. Sān. gr. (II. 1.1) allows upanayaoa in the 8th or 10th year from conception, the Mānava gṛ. (I. 22. 1) allows it in the 7th or 9th year, the Kathaka gf. (41. 1-3) prescribes 7th, 9th and 11th years for the upanayana of the three varnas respectively. In some smṛtis upanayana is allowed to be performed even earlier or at different ages, e. g. Gautama (I. 6-8) prescribes that upanayana for a brāhmana is in the 8th year from conception but it may be in the 5th or 9th according to the result desired; and Manu. II. 37 says that if spiritual eminence ( for the boy ) is desired ( by his father) then upanayana may be performed in the 5th year for a brāhmans, in the 6th year for a ksatriya if there is a desire for military power, in the 8th for a vaisya if there is desire for endeavour to accumulate wealth. Vaik. (II. 3) also prescribes the 5th, 8th, 9th years from con ception for a brāhmaṇa if there is a desire respectively for

Ap. and several others employ the Atma nepada perut while Adv., Khadira (11. 2. 1) and Par. employ the Parasmai pada 39 . It should be noticed that in the Atharvaveda XI. 7. 3., au XI. 5. 4.1, 31. . IV. 4. 5 and elsewhere in the Vedic toxts it is the Atma ne pada that is found. Papini (I. 3. 36) lays down that the root 'ni' takes the Atmapopade alone in the case of soveral sonses one of which is भाचार्यकरण (and so we should have उपनयेत only). हरदत्त quotes a कारिका that the TFHTE is a mistake FACErotsTreat Thr: I sure करणे यस्मात्मामोत्यत्रात्मनेपदम् .

spiritual eminence, long life and wealth. The Ap. Dh. 8. I. 1. 1.21 and Baud. gr. (II. 5) prescribe 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th years respectively for one desiring spiritual eminence, long life, brilliance, abundant food, physical vigour and cattle. 

Therefore, the 8th, 11th and 12th years from birth for the three varnas are the principal time for upanayana; while the years from 5th onwards up to 11th are the secondary time ( gauṇa ) for a brāhmaṇa, 9th to 16th are secondary for ksatriya and so on. From 12th to 16 is gaunatara for brāhmaṇas and after 16 gaunatama for them. Vide Samskāra-prakāśa p. 342. 

The auspicious times according to the Ap. gr. and Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 19, Hir. gr. (1.1) and Vaik. are vasanta ( spring), griṣma (summer), and sarad (autumn) for the three Varpas. The Bhār. gr. (1. 1 ) says that upanayana for a brābmapa should be performed in vasanta, for a kṣatriya in summer or hemanta, for a vaisya in sarad, in the rains for a carpenter (rathakāra ) or in sisira for all. Sabara in his bhāsya on Jaimini VI. 1. 33 where upanayana is denied to śūdras quotes 

Tasante brāhmaṇam upanayita' as & Vedic text. Áśv. gr. I. 4.1 ( quoted above in f. n. 494), Hir. gr. (I. 1. 5, S. B. E. vol. 30 p.1 37 ) and Bhār, gr. (1.1) say that upanayana should be performed in the bright half of a month, on an auspicious nakṣatra, particularly under a naksatra the name of which is masculine.640 

Later works introduced very intricate rules about the proper months, tithis, days and times for upanayana. It is neither possible nor very necessary to go into these astrological details. But a few words must be said as in modern times upanayana is performed only in accordance with these rules. Vṛddhagārgya[^841] laid down that six months from Māgba wore the proper months for upamayana, while others say that five months from Māgha are the proper ones. Then 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 13th, 14th, 15th i. e. ( full moon and new moon ) tithis are generally avoided (though there are some counter exoeptions wbich are not set out here).

Proper times for 'Upanayana 

days and on galagraha (( the tithis specified above). Jupiter, Venus, Marg48 and Mercury are respectively the presiding deities of the Rgveda and the other Vedas. Therefore the upanayana of those who have to study these Vedas should be performed on the week days presided over by these planets. Among week days Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the best, Sunday is mid dling, Monday is the least suitable, but Tuesday and Saturday are prohibited (except that for students of the Samaveda and kṣatriyas Tuesday is allowed). Among the nakṣatras844 the proper ones are Hasta, Citrā, Svāti, Puṣya, Dhaniṣtha, Asvini, Mrgaśiras, Punarvasu, Sravana and Revati. There are other rules about nakṣatras with respect to those who follow a particular Veda ( which are passed over ). One rule is that all nakṣatras except Bharaṇi, Kșttikā, Maghā, Visakha, Jyestha, Satatārakā are good for all. The Moon and Jupiter must be astrologically strong with reference to the boy's horoscope. The rule about Jupiter probably arose from the fact that Jupiter was supposed to rule over knowledge and happiness and as upanayana was meant to be the entrance for Veda-study, Jupiter's benevolent aspect was thought to be necessary. If Jupiter and Venus are not to be seen owing to nearness to the sun, upanayana cannot be per formed. Jupiter when in the 2nd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th zodiacal sign from the sign of birth ( calculation to be made inclusive of the sign of birth ) is auspicious, when in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 10th place from the sign of birth it is auspicious after the performance of a propitiatory homa and when it is in the 4th, 8th, 12th place from birth, it is inauspicious. The moon is supposed to be malefic when she is in the 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 9th or 12th place froin the sign of birth. Four hours from sunrise is the best for upanayana, from that time to noon is middling and afternoon is prohibited. Some said that a person's upanayana should not be performed in the month in which he was born, others restricted the prohibition to the pakṣa ( the half) of the month in which he was born. There are other rules about the Lagna (the rising

A brahmacārl had to wear two garments, one for the lower part of the body (vāsas), another for covering the upper part of the body (uttariya). Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 2. 39-1. 1. 3. 1-2) says that the garment[^845] (vāsas) for a brāhmana, ksatriya or vaisya brahmavari is respectively to be made of bemp, flax, ajina ( deerskin), some teachers prescribe that the lower garment should be of cotton but coloured reddish-yellow for brāhmaṇas; dyed with madder for ksatriyas, dyed with turmeric for vaisyas.' Pār. gr. (II.5), Manu (II. 41 ) speak of 'āvika'( made of wool.) for vaiśys instead of *ajina'. Vas. Dh. 8. (XI. 64-67) says that a brāhmana (brahmacāri) should wear a (lower) garment which is white and unblemished (or new) and for a ksatriya or vaisya it should be the same as in Ap. Dh., but for vaisya Vas. prescribes also one made of kusa grass or he says that all should wear cotton cloth that is undyed.' Gaut. (I, 17-20) on the other hand says for all the lower gar ment may be made of hemp, flax or kuśa grass (cira) or of the hair of the mountainous goat ( kutapa ); other teachers prescribe coloured garments, one coloured with the juice of trees for brāhmaṇas and madder-red and yellow for ksatriya and vaibya. Aśv. gr. (I. 19. 8), Pār. gr. (II. 5), Vas. Dh, S. (XI. 61-63), Baud. gr. (II.5.16 ) say that the upper garment for a brāhmaṇa should be the skin of a black deer, for kṣatriya the skin of ruru deer and for a vaisya of cow-skin or of goat skin. Baud. and Asv. pres. cribe only goat skin. Pār. gļ, adds that if any one cannot secure & skin suited to one's varna, he may wear an upper garment of cow-hide as the cow is the chief among animals.648 Baud. gr. II. 5. 16 prescribes the skin of black deer for all in the same

ciroumstances. Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 1. 3.7-8) gives the option to all varnas to use a sheep skin (as upper garment) or a woollen plaid ( kambala ). Ābv. gr. ( I. 19. 8-9) appears to suggest that the lower and upper garments may be of the same skin or that the lower garment may be white or coloured ( as stated above by Ap. Dh, S.). The Kathaka gr.647 ( 41. 13 ) says that the upper garment for the three varpas should be respectively of the skins of black deer, tiger and ruru deer. A vestige of these rules survives in the modern practice of tying a small piece of deer skin to the yajaopavita of the boy when his upanayana is performed. 

That the rules about the lower and upper garments go back to great antiquity is shown by a reference to a Brahmana passage in the Ap. Dh. 8.648 1. 1. 3.9 'one should wear only deer skin ( as lower and upper garments ) if one desires the increase of Vedlo lore, only (cotton) garments if one desires the increase of martial valour and both if one desires both'. 

Danda (staff) --There is some divergence of view about the trees of wbich the staff was to be made. Aśv. gr. ( I. 19. 13 and I. 20.1) says a staff of the palasa wood for a brāhmana, of udumbara for a kṣatriya and of bilva for a vaisya or all the varnas may employ a staff of any of these trees.' The Āp. gr. 11. 15-16 (this is the same as Ap. Dh. 8.1.1.2. 38) says that the staff should be of palāsa wood for a brāhmaṇa, of the branch of the nyagrodha tree ( so that the downward end of the branch forma the tip of the staff) for a ksatriya, of badara or udumbara wood for a vaibya; while some teachers say that the staff should be made of a tree (which is used in sacrifices ) without reference to any varna, Gaut. (I. 21 ) and Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 5. 17 ) Bay that the staff of palāśa or bilva should be used for brābmana and Gaut. (I. 22-23 ) says that aśvattha and pilu wood staff should be used respectively for kṣatriya and vaisya or of any sacrificial tree for all varnag. Baud. gr. prescribes nyagrodha or rauhitaka for kṣatriya, and badara or udumbara for vaisya. Pār. gṛ.

(IL 5 ) recommends a staff of palaga, bilva and udumbara respectively for the three varnas (or any of these for all ). Kathaka gr. (41.22)recommends palāsa, aśvattha and nyagrodha respectively for the three. Manu (II. 45) presoribes bilva and palaga for brahmana, vata and khadira for kṣatriya, pilu and udumbara for vaibya, and Kulluka adds that two staffs should be used by the boy, as two are recommended in a compound. 

• The staff was required for support, for controlling the cattle of the teacher ( which the student was to tend ), for proteo tion when going out at night and for guidance when entering a river or the like.649 

The length of the staff varied according to the varna of the boy. Aśv. gr. I. 19. 13, Gaut. I. 25, Vas. Dh. 8. (XI. 55-57), Par. gr. (II. 5), Manu ( II. 46 ) presoribe that in the case of the brahmana, ksatriya or vaibga boy respectively the staff should be as high as his head, forehead or the tip of the nose, The Sān. gr. ( 11.'1. 21-23, S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 260) on the other hand reverses this ( the brahmans having the shortest staff and the vaisya the longest ). Gaut. I. 26 says that the staff should be one not eaten by worms, should have the bark attached to it, and should have a curved tip, while Manu II. 47 adds that the staff should be straight, pleasing to look at and should not have come into contact with fire. The Sān. gr. (II. 13. 2-3) prescribes that the brahmacāri should not allow any one to pass between himself and his staff and that if the staff, girdle or the yajñopavita break or rend, he has to undergo a penance (same as the one for the breaking of a chariot at a wedding procession ) and that at the end of the period of brahmacarya, he should sacrifice in water the yajñopavita, staff, the girdle and the skin 650 with a mantra to Varuna ( Rg. I. 24. 6) or with the sacred syllable 'om'. Manu II. 64 and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. ( 27. 29 ) say the same thing. 

Mekhala ( girdle):--Gaut. (I. 15), Aśv. gr. ( I. 19. 11), Baud. gr. (IL 5. 13), Manu II. 42, Kathaka gr. (41. 12), Bhār, gṛ. (I. 2) and others prescribe that a girdle made of muñja grass should be

Mekhala ( girdle) at Upanayana

tled round a brahmana boy's waist, one made of mūry: grass (which is used for making a bowstring) for a kṣatriya and one of hemp cords for a vaisya. Pāraskara says that the string of a bow should be used for a ksatriya and of mūrvā grass for a vaisya and adds that in the absence of these the girdle should respectively be made of kusa, aśmantaka and balvaja grass ( for brābmana, kṣatriya and vaibya). Manu (II. 42-43) gives the same rules as Pār, gr, Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 1.2. 35-37) si optionally allows & girdle of muñja grass with an iron piece intertwined in it for ksatriyas and woollen string or the yoke-string or a string of tāmala bark for vaisyas ( according to some ). Baud. gr. (II. 5. 13 ) allows mauñji girdle also to all. Some of the sūtras (e. g. Baud. gr., Āp. Dh.S.) further prescribe that the girdle of muñja grass should have three strings to it and the grass should have its ends turned to the right and the knot of the girdle should be brought near the navel. Manu ( II. 43 ) says that there may be one knot or three or five (according to family usage, says Kullūks ). 688 

In order to convey an idea of the rites of upanayana in the days of the grhya sūtras the ceremony as contained in the Asy. gr. sūtra (which is among the shortest ) is set out in full.*** 'Let him initiate the boy who is decked, whose hair (on the head) is shaved (and arranged), who wears a new garment or an antelope skin if a brāhmaṇa, ruru skin if a ksatriya, goat's skin if a vaisya; if they put on garments they should put on dyed ones, reddish-yellow, red and yellow (for a brāhmana, ksatriya, vaiśya respectively), they should have gird]es and staffs ( ag described above). While the boy takes hold of ( the hand of) his teacher, the latter offers ( a homa of olarified butter oblations) in the fire (as described above) and seats himself to the north of the fire with his face turned to the east, while the other one ( the boy ) stations himself in front ( of the teacher) with his face turned to the west. The teacher then fills the folded hands of both bimself and of the boy with water and with the vergewe choose that of Savitr (Rg. V. 82. 1) the teacher drops down the water in his own folded hands on to the water in the folded

The teacher should cause (the boy ) to look at the Bun, while the teacher repeats 'God Savits! this is thy brahmacāri, protect him, may be not die "854 and (the teacher should further ) say 'Whose brabinacārl art thou ? thou art the brahmavārl of Prāṇa. Who does initiate thee and whom ( does he initiate )? I gives thee to Ka ( to Prajāpati)'. With the half verse (Rg. III 8. 4.) 'the young man, well attired and dressed, came so hither' he ( the teacher ) should cause him to turn round to the right and with his two hands placed over the boy's ) shoulders he should touch the place of the boy's heart repeating the latter half (of Rp. III. 8. 4). Having wiped the ground round the fire the brahmacārl should put ( on the fire ) a fuel stick silently, since it is known (from sruti) * what belongs to Prajapati is silently ( done)', and the brahmacārı belongs to Prajapati. Some do this (offering of a fuel stick) with a mantra 'to Agni I have brought a fuel stick, to the great Jātavedas; by the fuel stick mayst thou increase, Oh Agni and may we (increase ) through brahman (prayer or spiritual lore), svāhā',657 Having put the fuel stiok ( on the fire) and having touched the fire, he ( the student ) thrice wipes off his face with the words ' I

Seizing the student's hands with the upper garment (of the student) and his own hands the teacher recites the Sāvitri, first pāda by pāda, then hemistich by bemistich (and lastly) the whole verse. He (the teacher) should make him ( the student) recite ( the Savitri) as much as he is able. On tbe place of the student's heart the teacher lays his hand with the fingers upturned with the formula 'I place thy heartoso unto duty to me; may thy mind follow my mind; may you attend on my words single-minded; may Bṛbaspati appoint thee unto me.

of interest and divergence may be noted here briefly. It is remarkable that Aśv., Āp. and several other sūtrakāras do not say a word about the sacred thread, while & few like Hir. gr. (I. 2. 6), Bhār. gs. ( 1.3 ) and Mānava gr. ( I. 22. % ) say that the boy already wears the yajśopavita before the homa begins; while Baud. gr.662 (II. 5. 7) says that the boy is given the yajñopavśta and then made to recite the well-known mantra "the Yajñopapita is extremely sacred' and the Vaik, smārta (II. 5 ) says that the teacher gives the upper garment to the boy with 668 the verge paridam vāgah', the sacred thread with the mantra 'Yajñopavitam'and the black antelope skin with the mantra 'the eye of Mitra'. Sudarśana on Āp. gr. 10.5 says that the boy puts on the yajāopavita with the mantra before he takes bis meal ( according to some) or (according to others) before he puts the fuel stick on the fire and relies on Āp, Dk. 8. I. 5. 15. 1 for support. According to Karka and Haribara ( on Pāraskara ) the yajśopavita was given to the student by the teacher after the tying of the girdle. The Samskāratattva p. 934 says the same. Late works like the Samskāraratnamālā (p. 202 ) prescribe the wearing of the sacred thread before the bome. The origin and development of the ideas about yajñopayita will be dealt with separately later on, Ap. gf, (X.5), Baud gs. (II. 5. 7) and Pār. gr. (II. 2) prescribe a dinner to brāhmaṇas before the ceremonies begin and receiving their benedictions. Ap. gr. (X.5), Bhār. gr. (I. 1), Baud gp. 685 (II. 5. 7) say that the boy also is made to take food; socording to later works ( e. g. Samskararatnamālā ) the boy takes his meal in the same dish with his mother (for the last time) and other brahmacārins (eight in number) are also invited at the same time for meals in the

company of the boy. This practice is observed even in modern times. Almost all prescribe that the boy is shaved on this day ( as in caula ); this also is done in modern times. But in ancient \#68 times the shaving was done by the ācārya bimself as stated by Sudarsana on Āp. gr. 10. 6-8. There are several other matters detailed in Ap. and others, on which Asy, and some others are silent. The important ones are mentioned below. 

(a) Ap. gr. (10.9), Mānava gr. (I. 23. 12), Baud. gr. (II. 5, 10), Khādira gr. (11. 4) and Bhār, gr. (1.8) make the boy tread on & stone to the north of the fire with his right foot after home. The mantras repeated in the several sūtras are significant asking the boy to be firm like a stone. 669 

(6) Mānava gf. (1.22.3) and Kathaka gp. (41. 10) preboribe after homa the tasting of ourds thrice after repeating the verse * Dadbikrāvạo skāriṣam'(Rg. IV. 39. 6=Tai. 8. 1. 5. 4. 11 ). 

(c) Pār. gp. (II.2), Bhār. gr. (1.7), Ap. gs. (11.1-4), Āp. Mantrapātha (IL. 3. 27-30), Baud. gr. II. 5. 25 ( quoting Satya yanaka), Mānava gṛ. I. 22. 4-5, and Khādira gr. II. 4. 12 refer to the fact that the teacher asks the boy his name and the latter pronounces his name. The teacher also asks whose brahmacārı the boy is. 

A person was given ( as shown above at pp. 246-247 ) an abhivadanlya name either derived from the naksatra of birth or from a deity name or the gotra name. This was necessary for several purposes. The teacher had to know that the boy came from a good family, he had also to address him by name ( as there might be several pupils). It is wrong to suppose 868 from the story of Satyakāma Jābāla (where the

It is one thing to have a right and another to exeroise it. Probably very few ksatriyas cared to submit their sons to the rigorous discipline of brahmacarya as laid down in the smrtis and cared much less for Veda studies. In the Mahābhārata and in the Kādambari it is said that the princes were taught in a special house con struoted for the purpose and teachers were paid handsomely and brought there to teach instead of the princes going to the teachers. 

It is not possible for want of space to show how the great est possible confusion prevails as to the order of the various components of the ceremony of upanayana, But a few striking examples may be gived. Aśvalāyana gr. treats of the tying of the girdle and the giving of the staff almost at the end of the ceremony, while Ap. gr. puts this after homa and immediately before anjalipūrana (Glling the folded hands of both with water); Asvolāyana puts adityadarsana after the boy's band is held by the teacher and before paridāna (handing the boy over to the deities ), but Bhār. ( I. 9) puts it after the instruction in the observances of brahmacarya. The Bhār. gr. (1.9) treats of adityadarśana almost at the end of the rites, while Asy. places it among the earlier ones after homa. Besides the same mantras are employed by different sūtras for different purposes; for example, the mantra *susrayaḥ &c.' is employed by Ap. at the time of taking the staff by the boy (XI. 14 and Mantrapatha II. 5. 1), while Abv. gr. ( I. 22. 19), Bhār. gr. (1. 10), Māneva gr. (I. 23, 17 ) employ it in 'medhajanana' (on the 4th day after upanayana) and Pār. gs. (II. 4) employs it at the time of putting a fuel stiok on fire. Aśv. employs the verse 'yuva suvāsaḥ' (Rg. III. 8. 4) for making the boy turn round ( first half ) and for touching the region of the boy's heart (latter half ), while the same verse is employed at the time of tying the girdle round the boy's waist by the Mānave gr. (1. 22.8 ) and Par. 87.(II. 2). 

Later writers went on adding mantras and details.' On the day prior to upapayana the Nāndiśrāddha was performed as said by Haradatta on Ap. gp. 10. 5. Grahamakha (& sacrifoe to the planets ) also may be performed the previous day or on any day within 7 or 10 days of the upanayana. Then before the actual upanayana, there is the worship of Gapapati and of

(pp. 197-210), which in the main follows the briefer procedure in the gfhya sūtras, may be consulted.

Yajñopavita 690 :--A few words must be said on the history of yajñopavita from ancient times. Among the earliest references is one from the Tai. S. II. 5. 11.1 'the nivita 671 is (used in actions) for men, the prācināvita ( is used in rites ) for pitrs, the upavita (in rites ) for gods; he wears it in the upavita mode (i.e. Blung from the left shoulder ), thereby he makes & distinguishing sign of the gods'. In the Tai, Br. (I. 6. 8.) we read 'wearing in the prāolnāvita form he offers towards the south; for in the case of pitīs, acts are performed towards the south. Disregarding that one should wear in the upavita form and offer in the north only, since both gods and pitss are worshipped (in this rite)'.87 The three words nivita, prāoināvita and upavita are explained in the Gobbila gp. (I. 2. 2-4) which says' raising his right arm, putting the head into ( the upavita ) he suspends ( the cord) over his left shoulder in such a way that it hangs down on his right side ; thus he becomes yajñopavitin. Passing his left arm, putting the bead ( into the upavita) he suspends it over his right shoulder, so that it hangs down along his left side; in this way he becomes prāolnāvitin; & person becomes prācipāvitin only in the paorifice offered to the Manes' 193.

Khadira gr. I. 1. 8-9, Manu II. 63, Baud. gr. paribhasa sutra II. 2.7 and 10, Vaik. I. 5. The Baud.in gr. paribhasa-sātra II.2.3 says' when it is carried over the neck, both shoulders and the chest and is held with both the thumbs ( of the two hands ) lower than the region of the heart and above the navel, that is nivita ; (when the śruti says it is) for men, what it means is that it is for sages. The occasions when nivita mode is used are: rsi-tarpana, sexual intercourse, samskares of one's children except when boma is to be performed, answering the calls of nature, carrying a corpse and whatever other actions are meant only for men; nivita is what hangs from the neck'. 

The Sat. Br. ( II. 4, 2.1, S. B. E. vol. 12, p. 361 ) says "the gods being yajñopavitins approached near, bending their right knee; he (Prajāpati ) said to them the sacrifice is your food, immortality is your strength, the sun is your light'; then the pitrs approached bim, being prācināvitins and bending their left knee and then men approached him covered with a garment and bending their bodies" etc.ors It is important to note here that men are said to have been covered only with a garment and there is no reference in their case to any mode of wearing either as yajñopavita or nivita or prādināvita. This rather suggests that men wore only garments when approaching gods and not necessarily a cord of threads. In the Tai.076 Br. III. 10.9. it is said that when vāk ( speech ) appeared to Devabhāga Gautama he put on the yajñopavita and fell down with the words. namo namah'. 

It seems to follow from a passage in the Tai. A. (II.1) that a strip of black antelope skin or of cloth was used in ancient times as upavita 677 'the sacrifice of him who wears the

yajñopa vita becomes spread out ( prosperous, famous ), while the sacrifice of him who does not wear it does not spread ; whatever a brāhmaṇa studies, wearing a yajśopavita, he really (therein) performs a sacrifice. Therefore one should study, sacrifice or officiate at a sacrifice with the yajñopavita on for securing the spreading of sacrifice; having worn an antelope skin or & garment on the right side, he raises the right hand and keeps the left down; this is yajāopavita; when this position is reversed it is prācināvita; the position called samvita is for men.' It is remarkable that here at any rato no cord of threads is meant by upavita, but only a piece of skin or cloth. The Par. M. (I. part 1 p. 173 ) quotes[^878] a portion of the above passage and remarks that the Tai. Ār. lays down that a man becomes an upavitin by wearing one of the two, viz. antelope skin and (cotton ) garment, 

In the Pūrvamimāmsāsūtra (III. 1.21) it is established (with reference to the words) in the Tai. S. IL. 5. 11. 1 (upayyayate eto. quoted in f. n. 671) that one has to be an upavitin throughout all the actions, prescribed in the sections on the Darsa-Purnamāsa sacrifice and not only when the Samidheni verses are recited, The first part of the same passage is discussed by Jaimini ( III. 4. 1-9) and it is established that the passage enjoins the wearing of upavita in Dars. -Pūrṇamās, which is devakarma and that the reference to prācināvita and nivita is only an anuvāda intended to enphasize the desirability of the wearing of upavita in sacri. fices to gods. The Tantravārtika 679 explains that nivita is tying the upavits round the throat like a braid of hair (according to some), while according to others it is tying it round the waist as if for girding up the loins and that the first is not done except in battle, while the latter has to be resorted to in all acts in order to depote solo attention to them. So according to the Tantravārtika, the Tai. S. is not referring (in II.5.11.1) to a cord of threads but to a piece of cloth. Some of the sūtrakāras and commentators drop hints that garments were used or could be used as upavita. Ap. Dh. S. (II. 2. 4. 22-23 ) says that a householder should always wear an upper garment and then adds'or the sacred thread may serve the purpose of an upper garment.' This shows that originally

History of Dhamatastra 



upavita meant an upper garment and not merely a cord of threads. In another place the same sutra says (II. 8. 19.12 ) *one (who partakes of sraddha dinner) should eat covered with an upper garment slung over tha left shoulder and passing under the right arm'. Haradatta gives two explanations of this, viz. that one should wear an upper garment ( while dining at a sraddha) like a yajliopavita i. e. under the right arm and over the left shoulder, that is, a brāhmana cannot rely on Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4.23 and wear at sraddha repast only the sacred thread ( but he must wear the garment in that fashion) and give up the sacred thread for the time. 880 While another view is that he must wear the sacred thread and the upper gar ment both in the fashion of upavita. Ap. Dh. S. (I.2.6. 18-19) proscribes that when a student wears two garments he should wear one of them (i. e. the upper one ) in the yajdopavita mode, but when he wears only one garment then he should wear it round the lower part of the body (and should not cover the upper body with a portion of the garment though it may be long enough for that). Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 presoribes that a man must be yajñopavitin at the time of waiting upon teachers, elders, guests, at the time of homa, in japa (murmuring prayer), at meals and in taking āoamana and at the time of daily vedic study. On this Haradatta says'yajñopavita means a particular mode of wearing the (upper ) garment; if one has no upper garment, then there is another ( but inferior) mode stated in Ap. Dh. S. II. 2. 4.23 and that at other times it is not necessary to have the yajñopavita'. 

The Gobhila gr. (1. 2. 1) in treating of upanayana 681 says 'the student takes as yajñopavita & cord of threads, a garment

or a rope of kuśa grass'. This indicates that though & cord of threads was considered in Gobhila's days as the appropriate yajñopa vita, that was not an invariable rule in his day and that & garment could be employed instead. The commentator being brought up in the latter day tradition explains by saying that if the sūtra was lost in a forest then & garment may be worn like the sacred thread and if evon that was lost a rope of kuśa. But this appears to be rather far-fetched as an explanation of Gobhila's unqualified words. Manu (II. 44 ) says that the upavita of a brāhmaṇa should be made of cotton , its strands should be twined with the right hand moved over them (or the twist of the strands must be upwards) and it should have three threads'. Medhātithi comments on this that 'upavita' means & particular mode of woaring a garment or a particular position of it and therefore bere by upavita is meant that which can be worn in that mode. The Sm. C. quotes a prose passage from Rṣyaérnga 

or one may carry out all the purposes for which yajñopavita is required by means of a garment and in its absence by a string of three threads'. From the above passages, from the fact that many of the grbyasūtras are entirely silent about the giving or wearing of the sacred thread in upanayana and from the fact that no mantra 688 is oited from the Vedic Literature for the act of giving the yajñopa vita (which is now the centre of the upanayans rites), while soores of vedic mantras are cited for the several component parts of the ceremony of upanayana, it is most probable, if not certain, that the sacred thread was not invariably used in the older times as in the times of the later amptis and in modern times, that originally the upper garment was need in various positions for certain acts, that it could be laid aside altogether in the most ancient times and that the cord of threads oame to be used first as an option and later on exclusively for the upper garnent. 

A few rules about yajñopapita may now be stated here.68% The yajñopavita is to have three threads of nine strands well

twisted (for each thread). Vide Baud. Db.8.1. 5.5., Devala quoted in the 8m. O. 684. The nine devatās of the nine tantus (strands ) are given by Devala viz. Omkāra, Agni, Nāga, Soma, Pitrs, Prajāpati, Vāyu, Sūrya,485 all gods. Medhātithi on Manu II.44 says that in iṣtis, animal sacrifices and soma sacrifices, the yajñopavita was to have only one thread of three tantus, but it was three-fold in three classes of ahina, ekāha, and satira sacrifices as they required three fires and in the seven somasarst has seven-fold and five-fold when viewed with reference to the three savanas and two samdbyāsThe yajaopavita should reach as far as the navel, should not reach beyond the navel, nor should it be above the chest.686 Manu II. 44 and Viṣṇu Db. S. 27. 19 prescribe that the yajñopavita for brāhmaṇa, ksatriya and vaisy a should respec tively be of cotton, bemp and sheep wool. Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5.5), Gobbila gp. (I.2.1) say that it may be of cotton thread or of kuśa grass and Devala as quoted in Sm. C. says that all twice-born persons should make their yajāopavita of cotton, of kṣumā, hair of cow's tail, hemp, tree bark or kusa according to the availa bility of the material.087 The remarks of the Samskāramayukha after quoting Manu II. 44 are interesting 'we do not know the origin of (or authority for) the practice of present-day kṣatriyas and vaisyas, viz. of wearing cotton yajñopavita'. This shows that in the 17th century A. D. many ksatriyas and vaisyas put on yajñopa vita.688 Kumārila also says that wearing yajśopavita and studying Vedas is common to all the three varṇas. 

The number of yajñopavitas to be worn differed according to circumstances. A brahınacarl was to wear only one yajñopavita and samnyāsins, when they kept yajñopa vita at all, also wore

only one. Asnātaka 689 (i. e. one who has returned from the teacher's house after brahmacarya) and a house-bolder were to wear two while one who desired long life may wear more than two. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 14 days 'snatakas should always wear & lower garment and an upper one, two yajñopavitas, should bave & stick and & pot filled with water'. Kaśyap: allowed & householder to wear any number up to ten. Whether yajñopa vita as worn in modern times was worn from the most ancient times or not, it is certain that long before the Christian era it had come to be so worn and it had become an inflexible rule that a brābmana must always wear & yajñopavita and have his top-knot (of hair) always tied up; if he did any act without observing this rule, it was inefficacious.690 Vas.691 and Baud, Dh. 8. ( II. %. 1) both say that a man must always wear yajñopavita. If a brāhmaṇa took his meals without wearing yajñopavita, he had to undergo prāyaścitts viz. to bathe, to mutter prayers and fast; vide Laghu-Harita verse 23 quoted by Aparārks pp. 1171, 1173. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 292 prescribes prāyaścitta for answering calls of nature without having the yajñopavite placed on the right ear ( as Yāj. I, 16 prescribes). Manu IV. 66 forbids the wearing of another's yajõopayita along with several other things (such as shoes, ornament, garland and kamaṇdalu). In Yāj. ( I. 16 and 133) and other smrtis the yajñopavita is called brahmasūtra. 

An interesting question is whether women ever had upa nayana performed or whether they had to wear the yajñopavita. Several sirtis contain instructive diota on this point.698 The

Hārstadbarmasūtra as quoted in the Sm. O. and other digeste says 'there are two sorts of women, those that are brabma vādinis ( i. e. students of sacred lore) and those that are sadyo vadhūs ( i. e, who straightway marry ). Out of these brahma. Vādinis have to go through upanayana, keeping fire, vedio study and begging in one's house ( i. e. under the parental roof); but in the case of sadyovadbūs when their marriage is drawing near, the mere ceremony of upanayans should somehow be performed and then their marriage should be celebrated.' In the Gobhila gp. 6o3 II. 1. 19 it is said " leading forward towards the sacred fire (from the house ) the bride who is wrapped in a robe and wears the sacred thread (slung from her left shoulder, in the yajñopavita mode ) he (the busband ) should murmur the verse. Soma gave her to Gandharva' ( Rg. X. 85. 41 )". It is clear that the girl, according to Gobhila, wore the yajñopavits as a symbol of the rite of upanayana. The com mentator to whom this procedure naturally seemed strange explains'yajñopavitinimas meaning whose upper garment is worn in the fashion of the sacred thread'. In the Samskāra tattvā of Raghunandana it is stated that Hariśarmā held that according to Gobhila the bride was to wear & yajopa vita, though Raghunandana himself does not approve of this expla. nation. In the ceremony of Samāvartana, Āśy, gr. III. 8, 694 on the subjeot of applying ointment says' after baving smeared the two hands with ointment a brāhmana should selve his face first, a ksatriya his two arms, & vaiśya his belly, a woman her private parts and persons who gain their live lihood by running, their thighs'. It is improper to say, as some do, that as to women this is a general rule inter polated in the treatment of samāvartana and has nothing to do with the latter. We should rather hold that Asv. knew of women undertaking Vedic study and 80 presoribed what they should do in their samāvartana. In the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 305. 20)*'s a brāhmaṇa is said to have taught to the

Yama®" says 'in former ages, tying of the girdle of muñja (i. e. upanayans ) was desired in the case of maidens, they were taught the vedes and made to recite the Sāvitri ( the sacred Gayatri verse ); either their father, uncle or brother taught them and not a stranger and begging was presoribed for a maiden in the house itself and she was not to wear deer-skin or bark garment and was not to have matted hair'. Manu seems to have been aware of this usage as prevalent in ancient tiines, if not his own. Having spoken of the samskāras from jātakarma to upanayana, Manu winds up ( II. 66 ) 'these ceremonies were to be performed in their entirety for women also, but without mantras' and adds ( II. 67 ) * the ceremony of marriage is the only saṁskāra per formed with Vedic mantras in the case of women; (in their case ) attendance on the husband amounts to serving a guru (which a student had to do) and performance of domestio duties to worship of fire' (which the student had to perform by offering a fuel-stick in the evening every day ). This shows that in the day of the Manusmrti, upanayana for women had gone out of practice, though there were faint glimmerings of its perform ance for women in former days. Relying on the words 'in former ages' occurring in the verses of Yama quoted above medieval digests like the Sm. C., the Nirnayasindhu and others say that this practice belonged to another yuga. In Baṇa. bhatta's Kadambari,498 Mabāśvetā (who was practising tapas) is described as one whose body was rendered pure bs (wearing) a brahmasūtra (i. e. yajñopavita )'. The yajñopavits came to have superhuman virtues attributed to it and so probably even women who were practising susterities wore it. The Sam. Pr.

(p. 419 ) quotes a verso saying that the Supreme Being is called yajña and yajśopavita is so called because it belongs to the Supreme Being (or is used in sacrifices for Him ).699 

Though ksatriyas and vaiśgas also were entitled to have the upanayana performed, it appears that they often neglected it or at least neglected the constant wearing of yajñopayita, so much so that from comparatively early times the yajñopavita came to be regarded as the peculiar indicator of the wearer's being of tbe brābmana caste. For example, Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa (XI. 64 ) 700 while describing the irate brāhmaṇa hero Paragu rāma says wearing the upavita, which was the heritage that came to him froin his father, and holding a formidable bow that came to him from the side of his mother (who was & kṣatriya princess). If the upavita had been as constantly worn by the kṣatriyas as by brāhmaṇas in Kalidāsa's day he would not have spoken of it as the peculiar sign of a brāhmaṇa, In the drama Venisamhāra ( Act III) when Karna resented the attitude of Aśvatthaman, who raised his left foot for kicking Karna, and said that he could not cut off his leg as by virtue of his caste (as brāhmana ) he could not be punished in that way, Aśvattha man replied by throwing away his sacred thread with the words 'here do I give up my caste'.701 That shows that in the days of the Venisambāra ( not later than about 600 A. D.) the yajñopavita had become the peculiar indicator of the caste of brahmanas only. 

The Baudhāyana-sutra quoted in the Samskāra-ratnamālā (p. 188 ) says that yarn spun by a brālmana or his maiden daughter is to be brought, then one is to measure first 96 angulas of it with the syllable bhūḥ, then another 96 with bhuvah and a third 96 with svah, then the yarn so measured is to be kept on a leaf of palāsa and is to be sprinkled with water to the accompaniment of the three mantras "āpo hi sthā' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3), with the four verses 'Hiranyavarṇāb' ( Tai, S. V, 6.1 and Atharva I. 33. 1-4 ) and with the anuvāka beginning with 'pavamānaḥ suvarjapaḥ '( Tai. Br. I. 4.8) and with the Gāyatri, then the yarn is to be taken in the left hand and there is to be a clapping of the two handa thrice, the yarn is to be twisted

with the three verses 'bhūragnim ca'( Tai. Br. III. 10.2) and then the knot is to be tied with the forinula 'Bhurbhuvaḥ svas candram&saṁ ca' (Tai. Br. III. 10. 2) and the nine deities 

omkāra, Agni(quoted above in note 685)' have to be invoked on the pine strands, then the upavita is to be taken with the mantra ' devasya tvā' and then it is to be shown to the sun with the verge 'ud vayam tamasaspari' (Rg. I. 50. 10) and then the yajñopayita is to be put on with the verse 'yajñopavitam &o.' Then there is to be a japa of the gāyatri verse and then Scamans. For a brief statement of the mode of putting on a fresh sacred thread vide note below. 702 

The Baudhayana-gphyasesasūtra (II. 8. 1-12 ) gives a few insignificant points of difference as to the upanayana of ksatriyas, vaisyas, ambastha and karaña (son of a vaisya from a sūdra female). It is not necessary to go into these details. 

The next important question is as to whether upanayana was performed in the case of the blind, the deaf and dumb, the idiotic &c. Jaimini has established that those who are devoid of a limb[^708] are not eligible for agnihotra, but this inability arises only when the defeot is incurable. Similarly the Ap. Dh.S. II. 6. 14. 1, Gaut. 28. 41-42, Vas. 17, 52-54, Manu 9. 201, Yāj. II. 140-141, Viṣṇu. Db. S. 15. 32 ff. lay down that persons who are impotent, palita, congenitally blind or deaf, cripple and those who suffer from incurable diseases are not entitled to share property on a partition, but are only entitled to be maintained. But they all allow even these to marry. As marriage is not possible for dvijatis unless upanayana precedes it, it appears that the core. mony of upanayana was gone through as far as it could be carried out in the case of the blind, the deaf and dumb &o. The Baud. gr. seṣasūtra (II. 9) prescribes a special procedure for the upanayana of the deaf and dumb and idiots. The principal 

702. In modern times whenevor a new yajaopavita has to be worn ( because the one worn is lost or cut &c.) the ceremony briefly consists in repeating the three verses 'Apo bi otha' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3) over water with which the yajñopa vita is to be sprinkled; then there is the repeti tion of the Gøyatri ton times (each time preceded by tho vythṛtis, as 

om bhur bhuraḥ ayah') and then the yajāopavita is to be put on with the mantra 'yajõopavītam paramam' (cited above in note 662 ).

( Ch. VII 

points in which their upanayana differs from that of others are that the offering of samidh, treading on a stone, putting on a garment, the tying of mekhala, the giving of deer skin and staff are done silently, that the boy does not mention his Dame, it is the doārya himself who makes offerings of cooked food or of clarified butter, all the mantras are muttered softly by the ācārya himself. The sūtra yot gaya that according to some the same procedure is followed as to other persons who are impotent, blind, lunatics, or suffering from such diseases as epilepsy, white leprosy or black leprosy &c. The Nirnayasindhu quotes a passage from the Brahmapuriṇa cited in the Prayogaparijata about the upangyana of the impotent, the deaf and others which contains rules similar to Baudhāyana's. The Sam. Pr. (pp. 399-401) and S. R. M. (pp. 273-274 ) also quote the passage and explain it. The purāna 90$ says that those who cannot repeat the Gayatri ( such as the deaf and dumb ) should be brought near the teacher or fire and that the teacher should then touch them and then mutter the Gayatri himself, but tbat in other cases such as lunatics, they should be made to repeat the Gāyatri at least if possible and if that too is not possible, then on touching them the acārya should repeat it. The game purana prescribes that kunda and golaka (the first being the offspring of an adulterous intercourse when the husband of the woman is living and the second when the husband is dead) should have upanayana performed in the same way as for the deaf and dumb, if it is known that the adulterer and the woman were both of the brābmana caste. There is some difference of opinion as to kunda and golaka. Manu (II. 174) defined them as above. Ap. Dh. S, II. 6. 13. 1, Manu (10.5) and Yaj. (I. 90, 92 ) 706 expressly say that a person born of a brāhmaṇa from a brahmana woman belongs to the same caste only if he is born in lawful wedlook and that even the anuloma sons must be born in wedlock. The kunda and golaka being the offspring of adultery

would not really be brāhmaṇas even though both parents were brahmanas. Thus, though these two are not strictly brāhmaṇas, upanayana of a secondary kind is allowed to them. Manu (III. 156 ) included the kunda and golaka among brābmanas not to be invited at śrāddha. Elaborate discussions have been held why they were so specially mentioned, when they were not on Manu's own dictum brāhmaṇas. Some like the author of the Samgraha held that the kunda and golaka forbidden by Manu in sraddha were those born under the ancient practice of niyoga; while others repudiated the idea that those born under the practice of niyoga had any taint attaching to them.709 

It is not necessary to go into the question of the upanayana of mixed castes. Manu ( X. 41 ) says that the six anulomas are eligible for the rites of drijas (and so for upanayana ) and the Mit.Pos on Yaj. I. 9% and 95 says that the anulomas have upanayana performed according to the rules of the oaste of the mother and further mixed castes arising from the six anuloma castes in the anuloma order are also eligible for upanayana. The Baud. gr. seṣasūtra II. 8 gives rules for the upana yana of kṣatriyas, vaisyas and of mixed castes like rathakara, ambaṣtba &c. Gaut.709 IV. 21 made an exception in the case of the son of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman. All pratilomas were like sūdra according to Manu (IV. 41 ) and the offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman, though anuloma, was like pratilomas. A śūdra is only ekajāti and not dvijāti (Gaut. X. 51) and for the pratilomas ( 88 well as for the gūdra ) there was no upanayana. 

Upanayana was so highly thought of that some of the ancient texts prescribe a method of upanayans for the Asvattha treo. Vide Baud. gs. seṣasūtra II, 10. In modern times algo rarely this upanayana is performed. To the west of the Asvattha tree homa is performed, the samskāras from pumsavana are imitated but with the vyabrtis only, the tree being touched with R&. III.

A piece of oloth is held between the tree and the performer, then eight auspicious verses are repeated (manga laṣtaka), the cloth is removed and then the hymn oalled Dbruva sūkta (Rg. X. 72. 1-9 ) is repeated. Other mantras (like Rg. X. 62-63 ) are also recited. Then & piece of cloth, yajñopavita, girdle, staff and deer-skin are given with appropriate mantras and lastly after touching the tree, the Gāyatri is repeated. Ia E. O. vol. III. Malavalli No. 22 there is a reference to the upanayana of Aśvattha trees performed by one Bāohappa in 1358 A, D. 

Savitryupadesa - It will be seen from the passage of the Sat. Br. quoted above (in note 625) that the sacred Gayatri verse was imparted in very apoient times to the student by the teacher 8 year, or six months, 24, 12 or 3 days after upanayana and that the Sat. Br. prescribes that in the case of brāhmaṇa students this must be done immediately. This ancient rule was probably due to the fact that students in those far-off times when they came to the teacher at the age of seven or eight had hardly any previous instruction and so must have found it difficult to pronounce properly and correotly the sacred verse immediately on initiation. It is for this reason that so modern & work as the S. R. M. (p. 194) says that such mantras As 'San-no devirabhiṣtaye' (Rg. X. 9. 4) which have to be repeated by the brahmacārl in the rites of upanayana should be taught to him even before upanayana, just as the wife (who being a woman had no upanayana performed ) was taught the Vedic mantras accompanying such acts as that of examining ajya in sacrifices.710 The same rule of postponing the instruc tion in Gayatri is stated in Sān. gr. II. 5, Mānava gṛ. I. 22. 15, Bhār. gṛ. I. 9, Pār. gṛ. II. 3. The general practice however seems to have been to impart the Gayatri that very day. According to most of the sūtras the teacher sits to the north of the fire facing the east and in front of him the student sits facing the west and then the student requests the teacher to recite to him the Verse sacred to Savitr and the toacher imparts to him first one pāda at a time, then two pādas and then the whole.

Various intricate modes occur in the sūtras and the commentaries thereon about how this first instruction in Gāyatri is to be carried out. The differences are due to the place assigned to the vyābrtis[^713] °( bbūḥ, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ ). Two illustrations are set out below from Sudarśana 714 on Ap. gr. II. 11. The syllable 'om ' has been looked upon as very sacred from ancient times and is a symbol of the Supreme Being. The Tai. Br. II. 11 contains & eulogy of 'omkara ' and quotes Rg. I. 164.39 in support rco aksare parame &c.' taking the word 'aksara' to mean the 'omkara'. The Tai. Up. I. 8. says (syllable) om is Brahma; om is all this (universe). A brahmana about to begin the teaching (of the Veda) says 'om' with the idea that he may reach pear brahmi. 'Om' is called pranava. Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 13. 6 says 'omkara is the door to

Gautama (1. 52. and 25.8) speaks of only five, via भूः, भुवः, स्वः, पुरुषः, सत्य, while the व्याहृतिसाम has the same five, but gris last.

beaven; therefore one who is about to study the Veda, should start his study by first repeating om.' Manu (II. 74 ) prescribes the repetition of pranava at the beginning and at the end of daily Vedic study and further on (II. 76 ) says that the three letters 'a', 'u','m'(in om) and the three vyābftis were distilled from the three vedas by Prajāpati as the essence. Medbātitbi on Manu (II. 74 ) says that 'om must be uttered at the begin. ning of the daily Vedic study by the student or by the house holder ( when performing brahmayajña ), but it is not necessary in japa' &o. In the Mārkandeya-purāṇa chap. 4%, Vayu chap. 20, Vṭddha-Harsta-smrti VI. 59-62 and in numerous other places there are hyperbolical or esoterio identifications of the three letters of om with Viṣṇu, Lakṣmi and the jive, with the three Vedas, with the three worlds, with three fires &o. In the Kathopaniṣad I. 2. 15-17 om is said to be the end of all Vedas, the source of the knowledge of brahma and also its symbol. 

The sacred Gayatri verse is Rg. III. 62. 10 and oocurs in the other Vedas also. It is addressed to Savitr (the sun) and may also be interpreted as a prayer to the Source and Inspirer of everything. It literally means 'we contemplate that esteemed (longed for) refulgence ( glory ) of the divine Savitr who may inspire our intellects (or actions)'. Some gṭhya sūtras prescribe the same vorge for all students, whether brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas or vaisyas. But others say that for brāhmana the Sāvitrl verse is the Gāyatri, but for ksatriyas and vaisyas, a sāvitri ( verse addressed to Savitr) in the Triṣçubh (having 11 syllables in each quarter) or Jagati (12 syllables in each quarter ) should be the proper one. Here again there is difference. According to the commentators on the Kathaka gr. (41.20 ), the verge 'adabdhebhiḥ savita'( Kathakam IV. 10) and the verge Viśvā rūpāpi' (Kathakam XVI. 8) are cited as the Savitri for a kṣatriya and a vaisya respectively; while the commentator on 

Sān. gr. (II. 5. 4-6) says that the Trisṭubh which is to be taught as the Sāvitri to the kṣatriya students is '& kṛṣpena rajasā' 

Rg. I. 35. 2) and the Jagati Savitri for the valấya is. Hiranya pāṇiḥ savita' (Rg. I. 35. 9 ) or hamsaḥ śuciṣad' (Rg. IV. 40. 5). According to the Vārabagļhya (5) 'devo yāti savita' and 'yuñjate manaḥ'(Rg. V. 81.1) are the Triṣtubh and Jagat meant as Savitri for the kṣatriya and vaisya respectively. According to Satatapa quoted in the Madanapārijāta (p. 23) the verse ' Deva savitaḥ' (Tai. S. I. 7.7.1, Kathakam XIII. 14) is the sāvitri for the ksatriya. According to Medbātithi on Manu II. 38 : & krsñena ( Rg. I. 35. 2 ) and 'visva rūpāṇi' ( Kathakam XVI. 8)

are the two Sāvitris respectively for ksatriya and vaibya. That all these rules about the Sāvitrī being in the Gayatri, Tristubh and Jagati metres for the three varnas respectively are probably very ancient follows from the text 'gāyatrgā brāhmaṇamassajata triṣtubbā rājanyam &c.' (quoted in note 356 above). The Asv. gr., Āp. gr., and some other gūtras are entirely silent on the point, while Pār, gr. II. 3 allows an option viz, all varnas may learn the Gāyatri or the Savitri verses in the Gayatri, Tristubh and Jagati respectively. Why the Gāyatri verse (Rg. III. 62. 10) came to be famous it is difficult to say. Its fame was probably due to its grand simplicity and to its adaptability to an idealistic conception of the world as emanating from an all-pervading Intelligence. The Gopatha Brābmana (I. 32-33 ) explains the Gāyatri in various ways. In the Tai. Ār. (II. 11 ) it is stated that the mystio words'bhūḥ. bhuvah, svaḥ' are the truth (essence) of speech and that Savita in the Gayatri means 'one who en. genders glory,96 Atharvaveda 19. 71. 1 calls it vedamata' and prays that it may confor long life, glory, children, cattle 

&c, on the singer.717 The Br. Up. V, 14. 1-6718 contains a sublime eulogy of Gāyatri which word is there derived from 'gaya' meaning prāṇa', and the root 'trai' ( to save ) and it is said that when the teacher repeats the Gāyatri for the benefit of the young student be thereby saves the boy's life (from ignorance and the effects of sin). The Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 10 montions a brahmana text to the effect that the Savitri is recited for all the Vedas ( i.e. by its recital all Vedas become recited as it is their essence ). Manu II. 77 ( =Vispu Dh. S. 55. 14 ) says that each pada of the Savitri was as if extracted from each of the three Vedas and that ( II. 81=Viṣṇu Dh. S. 55, 15 ) the Savitri together with om and the three mystic syllables (bhūḥ &o.) is the mouth of Vedic lore (sinoe Vedic study starts with it, or 'brabna may mean 'the Supreme Being').

Brahmacāri-dharmāḥCertain rules and observances are prescribed for all brahmacārins 7%, They are of two kinds, some are pregoribed for a very short time and some have to be observed for all the years of studenthood, The Asv.gr. I. 22.17 783 says " for three nights, or twelve nights or 8 year after upanayana

the brahmacāri should not eat' kṣāra' and 'lavana' and should sleep on the ground". The same rule is stated by Baud. gr. II. 5. 55 ( adding the maintenance of the fire kindled at the upanayana for three days), Bhār. gr. I. 10, Pār. gr. II. 5, Kbūdira gr. II. 4. 33 (adding avoidance of milk also for three days). Hir. gr. ( I. 8. 2 ) specially prescribes for the first three days the avoidance of kṣāra, of lavana and vegetables, and the duty of sleeping on the ground, of not drinking out of an earthen vessel, of not giving the remnants of his food to śūdras and several other observances which he has to continue throughout the period of student-hood. These latter are briefly indicated in Manu II. 108 and 176 viz. offering samidhs into fire, begging for food, not using a cot, working for the teacher, daily bath, tarpana of gods, sages and pitṛs &c. 

The observances that last throughout the period of student hood are first seen in the passage of the Sat. Br. (quoted above in note 625 ). The same are laid down in Aśv, gr, I, 22.2 ( quoted on p. 283 above), Pār. gr. II. 3, Āp. Mantrapātha (II. 6. 14), Kathaka gr. ( 41. 17 ) and other texts. These are principally acamana, guruśusrūṣā, vāksaiyama (silence), samidādhāna. When the teacher says in the upanayana' drink water, do work &c', the student is to reply with the word 'yes' ('bādham' or om ). But the gūtras and emptis lay down many rules about these and other observances; vide Gaut. II, 10-40, Sān. gr. II. 6.8, Gobhila gr. III. 1.27, Khādira gr. II. 5. 10-16, Hir. gr. 8.1-7, Ap. Dh. S, I. 1. 3. 11-1.2.7. 30, Baud. Dh. S. I. %, Manu II. 49-249, Yāj. I. 16-32 &o. The rules centre principally round agnipa ricaryā (worshipping fire), bhikṣā (begging for food ), samdhyopāsana, study of Veda and its methods and duration, avoidance of certain foods and drinks and other matters like singing &o., guruśusrūṣa ( including honouring him and his family and other elders ), and the special vratas of the brabma cāri. These principal topics will be dealt with in some detail now. Before doing so some other matters will have to be briefly disposed off. 

On the 4th day after upanayana a rite was performed called Medbājangna "* ( generation of intelligence) by virtue of which

it was supposed that the student's intellect was made capable of mastering Vedic lore. A$v. gr. I. 22. 18-19 deals with this. The teacher makes the student sprinkle water in an unobjectionable direction thrice from the left to the right with a pot of water round about a palāśa tree that has one root, or round a bunch of kuśa grass if there is no palāśa, and makes him repeat the mantra 'Oh glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, glorious one, are glorious, thus, glorious one, make me full of glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of Veda among men°725. The Bhār. gr. (1. 10 ) also prescribes this rite on the fourth day after upanayana and says that & palāśa tree with one root is to be anointed with ājya and the mantra 

suśravaḥ' (the same as in Āśv.) is to be muttered. Kathaka gr. 41. 18, Mānava gr. I. 22. 17 also refer to this. The Sam. Pr. (pp. 444-446) gives a more elaborate des cription. In addition to what is stated in Asv. gr. it quotes from Saunaka and adds a few more details, viz. the student deposits at the root of the palāśa his garments already worn, the staff and the girdle and then wears new ones and then when the boy returns to the house, a stream of water is poured before him. The teacher takes the garments &c. left by the boy. The Āp. gr. 11. 24 says that on the fourth day the teacher takes the garments worn on the day of upanayang by the student and the boy wears new ones. Sudarsana on Ap. 11. 24 speaks of palāśa-karms on the fourth day. The boy goes out with his ācārya to the east or north and three sthapdilas are prepared to the north or east of a palāsa tree and on these three pranava ( om ), sraddhā and medha are invoked, are worshipped with unguents, flowers, lamp &c. (as in the regular worship of an image ), then the pranava is worshipped with the formula 'yas-chandasām' to 'śrutam me gopaya' (Tai. Up. I.4.1), sraddha with the hymn'sraddhayāgniḥ 'Rg. X. 151 and Medhā with the anuvāka 'Medhā devi' (Tai. Ār. X, 39 ). Then the staff is deposited at the foot of the palāśa, another staff is taken and the student returns to the house with the acārya. In modern times in the Deccan a similar ceremony is gone through under the (Marathi) name 'Palasula'.

Upanayana anıl brahmacūridharma

We have seen above that the student has to offer samidh (fuel stick) into the fire on the day of upanayana. The fire kindled at the time of upanayana was to be kept up for three days and the fuel-stioks were offered in that fire during those days. Afterwards samidh was to be offered in the ordinary fire ( vide Baud. gr. II. 5. 55-57, Ap. gr. 11.22). The student is required to offer every day after upanayana a samidb into fire in the evening and in the morning. Asv. gß. I. 22. 6 prescribes this and the commentator Nārāyaṇa adds that in so doing he bas to observe the procedure prescribed in Asv. gr. I. 20.10-1. 21. 4 for the putting on of samidh on the first day. Sān, gr. II. 10, Manu II. 186, Yāj. I. 25 and almost all others prescribe the offering of samidh into fire in the evening as well as in the morning ; but Ap. Dh. 8. I. 1. 4. 17 notes that according to some "agnipāja' was to be performed in the evening only. Ap. Dh. S. (1. 1. 4. 14-20) lays down the following rules : 'the student 786 should always bring fuel from the forest and heap it on a low place (otherwise if placed high it may fall on anybody's head), one should not go out after sunset for bringing fuel-sticks. Hav. ing kindled fire, having swept round it he should offer fuel-sticks in the evening and the morning as already directed ( in the grhyasūtra). One should sweep round the fire that is burning red-hot with the hand and not with a broom (of kusa grass ).' The Ap. Dh. S, I. 5. 15. 12 further prescribes that no fuel is to be placed on fire ( in srauta and smārta rites ) unless water has been sprinkled over it. The student had not only to offer samidhs on his own account into the fire, but he had to help his ācārya in the latter's worship of fire by bringing fuel and by offering oblations for his acārya when the latter was away on a journey or was ill. The ĀŚv. gļ. I. 9. 1 says[^727] beginning from marriage a householder should worship gļhya fire himself or his wife or son or maiden daughter or pupil may do so.' The Chandogya Up. IV. 10 contains the story of Upakosala Kama layang who was a student of Satyakama Jābala and looked after his teacher's fires for twelve years and whom Satyakāma did not teach anything, though the wife of Satyakāma interceded on behalf of the dejected pupil.

History of Dharmaśāsira 

[ Ob, VII 

A few words about samidhs may be said here. The samidh 788 must be of palāśa or some other yajñiya tree ( used in sacrifices ). Such trees are palaga, asvattha, nyagrodha, plakṣa, vaikankata, udumbara, bilva, candana, sarala, sala, devadaru and khadira. The Vayupurāṇa quoted by Aparārka (p. 51 ) says that palāśa samidhs should be preferred, in their absence samidhs of khadira, in the absence of the first two, of sami, rohitaka and asvattha and in the absence of all these of arka and vetase. The Trikānda-mandana (II. 82-84 ) has several rules on this point. The principal trees for fuelsticks (samidh ) are palāśa and khadirs, but samidhs of kovidāra, bibbitaka, kapittha, karabha, rāja vṛkṣa, sakadruma, nipa, nimba, karañja, tilaka, śleṣmātaka or sālmali are not to be employed. The samidh was not to be thicker than the thumb, was to have its bark on it, was not to be worm-eaten nor divided, nor longer nor shorter than the span (prādesa ) nor having two branches, it was to be without leaves and was to be strong. 2. According to Hārita 'when death wanted to seize the brahmacāri formerly, Agni saved him from death and so a brahmacāri should serve fire.730 

The number of samidhs varied as shown above and not only in the worship of Agni by the brahmacāri, but also else where. 

Bhikṣā:--The Āśv, gr. after presoribing begging for food states (I. 22. 7-8) that the student should first beg of a man who would not refuse or of a woman who would not refuse and that in begging he should say 'sir, give food'. More detailed rules are laid down by others.

Let him beg of his mother first, then in other families which are generously disposed; he brings the food to his guru and announces it to him with the words '( these are ) the alms' and then the teacher accepts with the words ' these are good alms!," The Baud. gr. II. 5. 47-53 gives the same rules and adds 731 that a brāhmana student should beg with the words' bhavati bhiksām dehi' (lady, give me food), a ksatriya with the words 'bhikṣām bhavati debi' and a vaisya with the words 'debi bhiksām bhavati." Pār. gr. II. 5, Āp. Dh. 8. I. 1. 3. 28-30, Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 17, Manu II, 49, Yāj. I. 30 and others contain the same rules about addressing the ladies for alms.782 Pār. gr. II. 5 says that the student should first bog of three women who would not refuse or of six, of twelve or of an unlimited number and that acoording to some he should first beg of his mother. Manu IL, 50 says that he should first beg of his mother, sister or mother's sister. Ap. Dn. S. I. 1. 3. 26 says that if womon refuse to give alms to 8 devout brahmacarl he snatohes away or destroys their merit arising from sacrifices, gifts and burnt offerings, progeny, cattle, spiritual glory (of their families ) and food and quotes a Brāhmana passage therefore indeed one should not refuse to give food to a orowd of students moving about (for alms ) for fear that among them there may be some one who is like this (a devout student), and who has carried out all the observanoes for students. If a brahmavārl cannot get food elsewhere he may beg from his own family, from his elders (like maternal uncles), his relatives and lastly from his acārya himself. As to the persons 138 from whom to beg for food, one sees how the growing strictness of oaste rules about food during the lapse of centuries affected the brahmaoāri. Ap. Dh. S.734 I. 1. 3. 25 presoribes that

he could beg food from anybody except apapātras (persons like capdālas ) and abhiśastas (i. e. those who are guilty of or suspected of grave sins). Gaut. II. 41 expressly says that a brahmacārs may beg food from all the varṇas except from those who are abhiśasta and palita. Manu (II. 183 and 185 ) says a brahmacāri should beg for food at the houses of those who study the Veda and perform sacrifices, who are devoted to their duties and are virtuous in their conduct; if from such persons food cannot be had he may go about the whole village, but should avoid those who are abhisasta. Yāj. I. 29 says 'for his own maintenance a brahmacārl should beg food from brāhma ṇas who are blameless' and the ancient commentator Viśvarūpe says that the best way is to beg at brāhmapa houses, the next best is to beg of kṣatriya and vaiśya houses and to beg of kūdras is allowed only in āpad (time of distress or difficulty). Ausa nasa (Jiv, ed I. p. 505 ) says that a brahmacāri should beg only from houses of bis own caste ( as the best way probably ) or he may beg at the houses of all varpas, while Aögiras quoted in the Par. M. (1. 2, p. 41 ) says that even in a season of distress & brahmacāri should not beg for cooked food from gūdras, The Madanepārijāta p. 33 quotes a passage from the Bhaviṣyapurana to the effect that a brahmacāri may beg food from anybody except a sūdra. 

Food obtained by begging was supposed to be pure as said by Manu II. 189, Baud. Dh. S. I, 5, 56 and Yāj. I. 187. It was further said that a brahmaoāri who subsists on food obtained by begging is like one observing a fast (Manu II. 183 and Bphat-Parāgara p. 130 ). The brahmacārl was to eat food collected from several houses and was not to take food at a single person's house, except that when he was requested to dinner in honour of gods or the Manes he might do so by partak 

(Continued from last page) dourde was possible), while on 31. . I.1.3. 25 he explains 479 as

The word literally neans those who cannot be allowed to use tho vessels out of whicb members of other castes are to take food (i, e, those vessels when used by them have to be broken or thrown away). Spero p. 720 explains 37997 as afarer mat en: (i. o. one who has lost caste through the commission of some mortal sin). According to Ap. Dh. 8. I. 9. 24, 7-9 an abhijasta is one that kills any brahmana or kills a brahmana woman who is Atreyi. According to Ap.

ing of such food at such dinners as would not violate his TOWB. Vide Manu II. 188-189 and Yāj. I. 32. 

Corresponding to the duty of the student to beg was the obligation cast on householders to serve food according to their ability to brahmacūrins and yatis ( ascetics ). Gautama V. 16 prescribes that after performing the daily yajñas to gods ( vaisvadeva ) and offering bali to bhūtas, the householder should offer alms (of food ) preceded by the word 'svasti' and by water. Manu III. 94, Yāj. I. 108 and others say that alıns should be given to ascetics and brahmavārins with honour and welcome. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 108 says that alms should be ordinarily one morsel of food as large as the egg of & pea-hen and quotes a verse of Satātapa[^735] saying that'bhikṣā is as much as one morsel, that puṣkala is equal to four morgels, hanta is equal to four puṣkalas and agra is equal to three hantas.' 

The idea that a bralmanāri must beg for his food and offor fuel-sticks every day was so ingrained in ancient times that the Baud. Db. S. I. 2. 54 and Menu II. 187 ( = Viṣṇu Dh. S. 28. 52 ) prescribe that if for seven days continuously a brahma cārl who was not ill failed to offer fuel-sticks and to beg for food he violated his vow and had to undergo the same penance as was prescribed for a brahmacārl having sexual intercourse.738 Even in modern times many brāhmaṇa students (not only those who study the Ved& from orthodox teachers but even those learning English) begged for their daily food and by dint of hard discipline, patient industry and integrity rose to high positions in public life. However the practice of poor begging students attending English schools in this way is dying out, since English education does not now onsure for the poor brāhmaṇa students even a bare maintenance. 

Other important rules about the begging of food are that the student should not beg for his sake alone, should announce

to the teacher all that he has brought and eat only that which the teacher directs him to take; if the teacher is gone on a journey then he should announce it to the teacher's family ( wife, son ); if even these are absent, then to other learned brahmanas and eat with their permission. Vide Āp. Db. S. I. 1. 3. 31-35, Manu II. 51. He should leave no residue in his dish and wash it after taking his meal therein. If he is not able to eat the whole that he has brought he should bury it underground or consign it to water or place that which is more than he can eat near an ārya or give it to a sūdra who works for his teacher (Āp. Dh. S, I. 1. 3. 37-41). Ap. Dh. S. (I, 1. 3. 43-44) says that alms are held to be equal to sacrificial food, the teacher holds the place of the deity and of the ābavaniya fire, 737 

Other miscellaneous acts that the students had to do were bringing 738 water for the acārya in pots, collecting flowers, cowdung, earth, kus& grass &o. ( vide Manu II. 182 ). 

Sandhya:-On the day of upanayana there is no morning saidhyā. Jaimini 734 says 'as long as there is no imparting of the Gayatri there is no sandhya.' So the student begins bis samdbya in the noon of the day of upanayana. As however on that day he knows no Vedic text except the Gāyatri, his whole samdhyā worship consists of the Gāyatri, 

The word 'samdhya' literally means 'twilight', but also indicates the action of prayer performed in the morning and evening twilight. This act is generally styled 'samdhyopāsana' or 'samdhyāvandana' or simply 'sandhya.'740 This act of adoration is sometimes prescribed as necessary thrice a day viz. at day-break, in the noon and at sun-set e.g. Atri74) gays'& twice born person possessed of the knowledge of the Self should perform three gamdhy& adorations.' These are respectively named Gāyatri ( morning one), Savitri ( noon) and Sarasvati

All prescribe that the morning 748 prayer is to be begun before sunrise and should be carried on till the disc of the sun is seen on the horizon and the evening prayer begins when the diso of the sun is about to set and goes on up to the appearance of stars. This is the most proper time; but a secondary time was allowed up to three ghaṭikās after sunrise and sun-set. The duration of the prayer each time was to be one muhūrta ( i. e. two ghaṭikās, according to Yoga-yājāavalkya ) 

whatever the length of the day may be. 743 Manu (IV. 93-94) however recommends the prayer to extend as long as one could afford, since the ancient sages seoured long life, intelligence, glory, fame and spiritual eminence by long samdhyā prayers.*** 

According to inost writers japa of Gayatri and other sacred mantras is the principal thing in sandhya and other things such as mārjana are merely subsidiary, but Medhātithi on Manu II. 101 ( where the words are 'japanstiṣthet' and not * tiṣthan japet') says that japa is subsidiary or secondary and the place of the prayer and the posture of the praying person are the principal items. When it is said 'one should perform the sandhya' what is meant is that one should contemplate the deity called Aditya represented by the orb of the sun and should also contemplate on the fact that the same Intelligence dwells in his heart. The proper place for samdhyā prayer is outside the village ( Ap. Dh. 8. I. 11. 30. 8, Gaut. II. 16, Manava gr. I. 2. %), in a lonely place ( San. gr. II 9. 1 'araṇye') or on a river or other sacred spot (Baud. gr. II. 4. 1). But this does not apply to the agnihotrin, 748 who has to perform vedio rites and repeat homa

Vasiṣtha quoted by Aparārka says that samdhyā performed in a cowpen or on a river or near the shrine of Viṣṇu ( or other deity ) respectively is ten times, 100000 of times or numberless times better than sandhyāvandana in the house. *** All presoribe that the morning samdhya is to be performed standing and the evening one in a sitting posture ( Āśv. gļ, III. 7. 6, Śān. gr. II. 9. 1 and 3, Manu II. 102 ) and the morning samdhyā is to be performed facing the east and the evening one facing the northwest ( Aśv. gr. III. 7. 4, Sān. gr. II. 9. 1). He is to bathe, to sit in & pure spot on a seat of kusa grass, should have the sacred cord in the usual position and restrain his speech ( i, o, should be silent and not talk in the midst of samdhyā). 

The principal constituents of samdhyopasana are these : ācamanas (sipping of water ), prāṇāyāma, mārjana thrice ( sprinkling himself with water to the accompaniment of several mantras ), aghamarṣana, offering of water to the sun (arghya ), japa of Gayatrl, and upasthāns ( reciting mantras by way of worship of the sun in the morning and generally of Varuṇa in the evening). Among the earliest references to Samdhyopāsana is the one in the Tai. Ar. II. 2,749 where it is said that when brahmavādins facing the east throw up water consecrated by the Gayatri, the evil spirits that fight with the sun are sent tumbling into the country (called) Mandeha Aruṇa (of the evil spirits). This shows that in ancient times samdhyā consisted principally of offering water (arghya ) to the sun in worship and japa of Gayatri. Aśv. gr. III.7.3-6, San. gr. II. 9,1-3 and others refer only to the japa of the Gāyatri mantra in

Upanayana and sandhyā

Samdhyopāsana. Manava gr. (L. 2.1-5) refers only to the arghya offering to the sun and japa of Gāyatrl. It is in the Baud. Dh. S. II. 4 that we find an elaboration of samdhyopasana into various components such as acamana, mārjana, japa of Gayatri and upasthāna ( worship) of Mitra and Varuna ( respectively in the morning and evening with only two verses in each case ). *48 Modern writers went on adding details 0. g. it is now the practice in the Deccan to repeat the 24 names of Viṣṇu at the very beginning of the samdbyopāsana, but this is hardly any where prescribed by any smrti or early commentator. Similarly elaborate rules are laid down about mystic nyāsas with the sixteen verses of the Puruṣasukta ( vide Apararka p. 140 ), of the nyāsa of the Nārāyapamantra of 25 letters on 25 parts of the body (Vṛddha-Hārita VI. 16-19 ) and of the letters of the Gāyatri 

Brhatparāśara chap. V. p. 83). In modern times ācamana ia performed with the three names of Viṣṇu, viz. Kośava, Narayana and Madhava in the form om Kesavāya namaḥ.' The 24 names are given below.7488

(I. 5. 10) prescribes that one should not perform ācamana with water that is in a cleft of the earth. Ap. Dh. S. (1. 5. 15. 5) says the same thing.749 One should perform

acamana in a sitting posture ( and not standing nor bent) in a pure spot, facing the north or east, one should sip water thriloo with water that is not hot and that is free from foam or bubbles, one should after sipping water wipe the lips twice (thrice according to Āp.)and should touch with the wet right hand one's eyes, ears, nose, heart and head. The water for doamana should be as much as would penetrate (or reach) to the heart in the case of brahmaṇas, to the throat in the case of ksatriyas, to the palate in the case of vaisyas; women and sūdras should sip on occasions of donmana only once as much water as would reach the palate, Manu (II. 18) and Yāj. (I. 18) say that water should be sipped by the brāhmatirtha (i. e, from the root of the thumb).950 The further elaborate rules laid down in such smstis as Gobhila gr. (L 2.5-6), Saṅkhasmrti 10 are not set out here. The occasions for acamana are many. According to Gobbila " gr. I. 1.2 one must do every gṛbys rite with yajñopevita worn in the usual way and after doamana. Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 1 says that acamana is a subsidiary matter in all religious acts. There are several occasions when the sipping of water twice is necessary, the principal being before and after bhojana ( meals ); vide Gautama I, 40, Vas. 3. 38, Yaj. I. 196, Sm. O. I. p. 100, Madanapārijāta p. 57, Par. M. I. part 1. pp. 241-243. Both the Bṛ. Up. (VI. 1. 14 ) and Chan. Up. V. 2. 2 refer to the praotice of sipping water before and after bhojana and the Vedantasūtra III. 3. 18 is based on these upaniṣad passages and says that water is looked upon as the garment of prāṇa. 758 Numerous occasions when acamana is necessary are stated in Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 16. 15-16, Manu V. 138 and 145, Yaj. I. 196, Kūrmapurāṇa I. 2. 13. 1-8 &c.

Sarndhyā and prāmāyāma 

317 

Prānāyāma (restraint of breath ) is defined by the Yoga sūtra *** (IL 49 ) as the regulation of inhalation and exhalation of air. Gaut. I. 50 prescribes three prāṇāyāmas, each of which lasts for 15 matras (moras). Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 30 ( = Vas. Dh. 8. 25. 13=Saṅkhasmrti VII. 14 ) and Yaj. I. 23 say that the Siras of Gāyatri, the three vyābftis each preceded by 'om' and the Gayatri verse are to be rehearsed mentally during the time of prāṇāyāma. According to Yoga-yājñavalkya, one should first revolve in the mind the seven vyabftis, each preceded by 'om,' then the Gayatri and then the diras of Gāyatri, 754 Prānāyima has three components, pūraka ( inhaling the outside air ), kumbhaka ( keeping in the inhaled air i. e, neither taking in air nor giving it out) and reoaka (exhaling air from the lungs ). Manu VI. 70-71 highly praises the utility of prāṇāyāma in purifying the mind of sin. 

Mārjana is performed by means of kusa grass dipped in water kept in a vessel of copper or udumbara wood or earthen. ware and while doing so one is to repeat om,' the vyābrtis, Gayatri and the three verses 'apo hi ṣthā' (Rg. X, 9.1-3). Baud. Dh. S. II. 4. 2 adds more Vedic mantras for mārjana. *55 Mānava gr. I. 1.24, Yāj. I. 2% and others prescribe mārjana only with the three verses apo bi ṣtha'(Rg. X, 9, 1-3). 

Aghamarṣana (driving out sin) consists in taking water in the right hand formed in the shape of a cow's ear, holding it noar one's nose, breathing out from the nose on the water (with the idea of driving away sin from oneself) to the accom paniment of the three verses' ftam ca' (Rg. X. 190.1-3) and then casting the water away to one's left on the ground.

Arghya 756 ( offering water out of respeot to the sun ) conaists in taking water in one's joined hands, repeating the Gayatri verse over it and standing faoing the sun and casting it up thrice. If a man cannot have water ( being at the time of Samdhyā on a road or in jail &o.) he could use dust for water. The Tai. Ār. II. % says that a brāhmana contemplating the rising and setting sun and doing obeisance to it by going from left to right attains all bliss, since this Aditya is Brahma, 

As to japa of Gayatri, vide above under Savitryupadega (p. 304). There is an extensive literature about the greatness of the japa of Gāyatri and of other holy vedic mantras which are passed over bere and for which reference may be made to A parārka pp. 46–48, Sm, C. I. pp. 143--15%, Gr. R. pp. 241-250, Ahnikaprakāśa pp. 311-316. A few details will be given under āhnika, 

Astoupasthāna vide above(p.315, note 748). According to Baud. the worship 787 of the sun is done with the verses'udvayam' (Rg. I. 50.10), 'Udu tyam' (Rg. I. 50.1),'citram'(Rg. I. 115.1), 'tao-cakṣur' (Rg. VIL 66. 16), 'ya udagat' (Tai. Ār. IV. 42, 5). Manu II. 103 presoribes that he who does not perform the Sardhyopāsana in the morning and evening should be excluded from all actions meant for the benefit or honour of dvijas. Gobhila 788 smști II. 1 says the same and adds that brāhmanya resides in the three sathdhyās and that he who has no concern for samdhyopasana is not a brāhmaṇa, Baud. Dh. 8. II. 4. 20 calls upon the religious king to make brābmapas, who do not engage in samdhyopasana thrice a day, perform the work peculiar to sadras. The Kūrma-purāṇa ** goes so far as to say that even if a person engages in other actions which are religious but gives up the performance of samdhyopāsana, in so doing he falls into numerous hells. Manu declares (II. 102) that sins committed at night through ignorance ( or oversight) are removed by the performance of

morning samdhyā and the sins committed in the day are removed by the evening sandhyā. Baud. Dh. 8. II. 4. 25-28, Yaj. III, 307 are to the same effect. When a person is impure owing to mourning or birth in the family, he is to perform sandhyd only up to arghya to the sun but not japa nor upasthāna. 

In modern times the samdhyopasana has become a lengthy business by the addition of materials from purāṇas and the tantras. But as observed by the Samskararatnamālā rituals like nyāsa are non-Vedic 760 and many do not perform them. For various nyāsas and mudrās (postures of the fingers, hands eto.) one may consult the Smṛti-muktāphala ( āhnika pp. 328-333 ), Sm, C. I. pp. 146–148.761 

Nyāsa means 'mentally invoking god and holy texts to come to ocoupy certain parts of the body to render it a pure and fit receptacle for worship and contemplation. The sixteen verses of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) are respectively invoked to reside in the left and right hands, the left foot, the right foot, the left and right knees, the left and right sides, the navel, the heart, the throat, the left and right arms, the mouth, the eyes and the head ( vide Apararka p. 140 ). The Bhagavata (VI. 8. 4-5) recommends that one should perform nyāsa on the hands and limbs of one's own body with the two mantras of Narayana and thus make Nārāyaṇa one's armour when some danger arises and that one should perform nyāsa with 'om' and other syllables on one's feet, knees, thighs, belly, heart, chest, mouth and head.708 The Sm. C. I. p. 144 quotes verses from Vyāsa and Brahmā as to the nyāsa of the letters of the Gayatri with 'om' and namaḥ' on the several parts of the

body. Vśddha-Hārita VI. 16-19 speaks of the nyāge of the twenty-five letters of the mantra about Nārdyana on the twenty-five parts of the body. The Nityaofrapaddhati (pp. 578-579 ) describes the nyāga of the letters of the alphabet (51 in all ) from 'Om Keśavāya namaḥ' to 'kṣam Nṛsimbaya namaḥ.' One well-known mode is to assign Govinda, Mabidhara, Hṇśikeśa, Trivikrama, Viṣṇu, Madhava respectively on the tips of the thumb, the index finger, the middle finger, the ring finger, the small finger and the middle of the palm, Manu II. 60 enjoining the touching of the limbs and head with water appears to contain the germ of this practice of nyāsa. 

The Sm. O. I. (pp. 146–148 ) quotes long passages about the mudrūs (hand poses) to be made in the samdhyā adoration. The Samgraha 768 quoted in the Pūjāprakāśa (p. 123 ) states that the mudrās are to be made in worship, at the time of japa, dhyāna (contemplation) and when starting on kāmya rites ( performed for securing some desired object) and that they tend to bring the deity worshipped near to the worshipper. The names and number of mudrās differ considerably. For example, the Sm. O. and Smr. Mu. (abnika pp. 331-332 ) quote passages defining the following mudrās viz. sammukha, sampuṭa, vitata, vistirna, dvimukha, trimukha, adhomukba, vyāpakāñjalika, yamapasa, grathita, sammukhonmukha, vilamba, muștika, mina, kūrma, varāha, simbākrānta, mahākrānta, mudgara and pallava, The Nityācārapaddhati p. 533 derives the word mudrā from 'mud' (joy) and the root 'rā' (to give ) or 'drāvay' (causal of dru, to put to flight) and says that "nudra" is 80 called because it gives delight to the gods and also puts to flight asuras (evil beings). That work and the Pūjā-prakasa (pp. 123-126 ) give the names of mudrās. They are dvahani, sthāpini, samnidhāpani, samrodhini, prasādamudrā, avagun. thana-mudrā, sammukba, prarthana, sankha, cakra, gadā, abja, (or padma), musala, khadga, dhanus, bāpa, nāraca, kumbba, vighna (for Vighneśvara ), saura, pustaka, lakṣml, saptajihva ( for Agni Vaiśvānara ), durgā, namaskara (bringing together both hands from the wrist to the tips of the fingers ), añjali, samhara (in all 32). The Nitydoārapaddhati (p. 536 ) says that sankha, cakra, gada, padma, musala, khadga, srivatsa and kaustubha are the eight mudrās of Viṣṇu. The Sm. C. quotes a

work oalled 764 Mahasamhita that the mudrās are not to be performed in the presence of a crowd and if so performed the deities become angry and the mudrās become fruitless. The Sāradatilaka (23. 106 ) states that all deities are gladdened by the mudrās and in verses 107-114 describes the following mudrās, viz. dvahani, stbāpani, samnidhāpani, saṁrodbini, sammukha, Bakala, avagunthana, dhenu, mabāmudra. The Acara-dinakara of Vardhamana-sūri composed in samvat 1468 ( 1411-12 A. D.) for Jainas enumerates 42 mudrās and defines them ( 1923, part II. pp. 385-386 ). 

The influence of these mudrās spread outside India and they are still practised in the island of Bali. Miss Tyra de Kleen has brought out a very interesting book on the 'mudrās (the hand poses ) practised by Buddhist and Saiva priests' (called pedandas ) in Bali, with 60 full page drawings (1924, New York ).

The pivot of the whole educational system of ancient India was the teacher (variously called acārya, guru, u pādhyāya). The instruction was oral. Rg. VII. 103.5 ( speaking of frogs ) says 

when one of these frogs follows another in making noise just as a learner repeats the words of the teacher'. Vide the quotations from the Atharvaveda and the Sat. Br. cited above (f. n. 622 and 625 ). In the beginning the father alone may have taught his son. The story narrated in the Br. Up. V. 2. 1 and the story of Svetaketu Aruṇeya who was taught by his father everything he knew (Br. Up. VI. 2. 1 and 4 ) illustrate this (vide f. n. 633 ). But even from very ancient times the practice

of sending 786 boys to learn from an acārya had become usual. The Chan. Up. itself says in one passage (VI. 1) that Svetaketus Āruñeya was placed by his father for twelve years as a student with a teacher. The saine upaniṣad (III. 11. 5 ) says that the father should impart the 'madhuvidya' to his eldest son or to a wortby pupil only. As the boy stayed with the teacher in the latter's house and all instruction was oral, the teacher's position assumed the greatest importance. Satyakama Jābāla 767 says to his teacher (in Chan. IV. 9.3) 'I have heard from persons like your revered self that knowledge when learnt from an acārya reaches the highest excellence. The Svetāśva. taropaniṣad 768 ( VI. 23 ) places the guru almost on a level with God and inculcates the highest devotion to him. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 6. 13 says the pupil should wait upon the acārya as if he were "9 God.' The story of Ekalavya, whom Droṇa refused to take as & pupil because he was a niṣāda and who by worshipping the image of Dropa is alleged to have become an adept in archery, illustrates two points viz. the prevailing notion of the greatness of a guru and the necessity of single minded devotion to him for attaining proficienoy (vide Adiparva 132 for the story and also Droṇaparva 181. 17). The Mahābhārata condemns him who learns the Vedas at home and says that Raibhya became superior to Yavakrita 770 because the former learnt from a guru, while the other did not do 8o. In Manu and other smstis there is some divergence about the

greatness of the ādārya. Manu II. 146 ( = Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 30. 44 ) says that both the father (jangka ) and the teacher are oalled father (pilā ) but the father (i, e. ācārya) who imparts the sacred Veda is superior to the father that gives (physical) birth, since the birth in spiritual learning is for a brāhmaṇa of eternal benefit here and hereafter. But in II. 145 Manu 771 says that an ācārya is ten times superior to an upādhyāya, the father is superior to a hundred ācāryas, while the mother is thousand-fold superior to the father. Gaut. II. 56 declares that the ācārya is the highest among all gurus while according to some the mother js the highest. Yāj. I. 35 also places the mother higher than the ācārya. Gaut. I. 10-11, Vas. Dh. S. III. 21, Manu II. 140, Yaj. I. 34 define 778 the ācārya as one who performs the upana yana of the student and im parts the whole Veda to him. The Nirukta 773 ( I. 4) derives acārya as follows: 'he makes the student understand the proper course of conduct, or he collects wealth (i. e. fee) from the student (or gathers together the meanings of words ), or he increases the intelligence ( of the student)'. Āp. Dh. S. I. 1.1. 14 says 'The ācārya is so called since the student gathers his duties from him.' Manu II. 69 says that the teacher, after performing upa nayana, teaches his pupil the rules about sauca (bodily purity), ācāra (rules of conduct in every day life), the offering (of fuel-stick) in fire and sandhya adoration. Yāj. I. 15 is to the same effect. Though the words ācārya, guru 774 and upādhyāya are very often used as synonyms, anoient writers made a distinction between them. According to Manu II. 141 and 14%, an upadhyāya is one who teaches to a student & por tion of the Veda or the Vedāngas 775 (subsidiary lores of the

Veda ) as a means of his own livelihood and a guru is one who performs the samgkāras and who maintains the child. This latter definition shows that guru means the father here. Vas. Dh. 8. (III. 22-23), Viṣṇu Dh. S. 29. 2, and Yāj. I. 35 define upādhyāya in the same way as Manu. Acoording to Yāj. I. 34 the guru is one who performs the samskāras and imparts the Voda. This corroborates the statement made above that originally the father himself taught the Veda to his son. The word guru is often used in the sense of any elderly person, male or female, who is entitled to respect. Viṣṇu Dh.776 . ( 32.1-2 ) asys that the father, the mother and the acārga are the three highest gurus of a person and Manu II. 227-237 contain the most sublime glorification of these three, Davala 777 says that among gurus five deserve special honour, viz. father, mother, acarya, eldest brother and husband ( in the case of women)'. Manu (II. 149 ) says that whoever confers on another the benefit of knowledge, whether great or small, is the latter's guru. 

A great deal is said about the qualifications of the ācārya who is to perform the upanayana of a person and to teach him the Veda. Ap. Dh. S. 778 I. 1. 1. 11 refers to a Brahmana text to the effect "he whom a teacher devoid of learning initiates enters from darkness into darkness and be also (i. e. an acārya ) who is himself unlearned ( enters into darkness ).' Āp. Dh. S, (1. 1. 1. 12-13 ) further provides that one should desire a performer of one's upanayana who is endowed with learning and whose family is hereditarily learned and who is serene in mind and that one should study Vedic lore under him up to the end (of brahmacarya ) as long as the teacher doos not fall off from the path of dharma. Vyāss ( quoted in Sam, P. p. 408) says 779 that the dcārya should be a brahmapa who is solely

devoted to the Voda, who knows dharma, is born of a good family, who is pure, is a śrotriya that has studied his Vedic sākha and who is not lazy. Śrotriya has been defined above (f. n. 290 ). Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 6. 4 and Baud, gr. I. 7.3 define a śrotriya as one who has studied one śālchā of & Veda. Vide Vāyupurias vol, T. 59, 29 also.780 The āoārya in upanayang must be a brāhmaṇa; as to the study of veda one should ordinarily learn the Veda from & brāhmaṇa teacher; in times of difficulty (i, e, when a brāhmana is not available ) one may learn the Veda from a ksatriya or vaibya teacher; but in such circumstances the only service that & brābmaṇa student rendered to the guru would be following after the non-brāhmaṇa teacher; ho had not to render bodily service (such as shampooing or washing the feet &o). Vide Ap. Dh.S.II. 2, 4, 25-28 (quoted above in note 2:9), Gaut. 7,1-3, Baud, Dh. S. 1.2.40-42, Manu II. 241. Manu II. 238 allows even a brālmaṇa to learn subhā vidyā ( visibly beneficial knowledge ) even from a sūdra, Santiparva 165, 31 does the same.781 The Mit. on Yāj. I. 118 remarks that a kṣatriya or vaisya should teach & brahmana only when urged by him and not at his sweet will. Aparārka (p. 160 ) says that Manu II. 241 allows only teaching to a kṣatriya, but does not allow him to make it a means of his livelihood.784 

We saw above (p.321) that the instruction was entirely oral. The first thing that was taught to the boy was the pranava and the vyābṛtis and the Gāyatri. Then the boy was to be taught other parts of the Veda. It is desirable to get out briefly the method of teaching the Veda followed in ancient times. The Sān. gr. (IV. 8) describes the method as follows: the teacher sits facing the east or north, while the other (i, e, the student) sits to his right facing the north or two students may sit in that way; but if there are more than two they should sit as the available space will allow.788 The student should not sit on a high soat

before the teacher nor on the same seat with him; he should not stretoh out his feet, nor should he sit seizing his knees with his arm, nor should he lean against & support, nor should he place his feet on his lap nor should he hold his feet like an axe. After the student utters "Recite, Sir," 784 the teacher should urge him to pronounce 'om'; the other (i. e. the student) should reply 'om'. Thereafter he (the student) should recite continuously. After reciting he should clasp the teacher's feet and say 'we have finished, Sir' and go away to his business. Some teachers say that the teacher should say 'Leave, let us stop'. In the Rk Prātisakhya, 785 15th patala, there is a description of the method of teaching the Veda, which closely agrees with the above quotation from the San. gr. It adds that the teacher may also sit facing the north-east. When the teacher recites two words or more, the first pupil ( to the right of the teacher) repeats the first of the two or more words and the other pupils ropeat the rest afterwards. The teacher recites one word if it is a compound, two words if they are un-compounded; the teacher also clearly explains how to recite the words if there is any difficulty ; in this way the whole praśna is finished and all the pupils repeat again the whole of it. A praśna generally has three mantras and each adhydya has about sixty praśnas. Manu ( II. 70-74 ) also prescribes certain rules: the student should sip water (ācamana ) when about to begin Vedic study, should face the north, should fold both hands 786 together (and place them on his knee ), should wear light (pure) olothes, should at the beginning and end of Vedic study clasp the feet of the teacher with crossed hands

and should touch the right foot of the teacher with his own right hand and left foot with the left hand, should repeat *om' at the beginning and at the end of Vedic study. The teacher should say to the pupil 'repeat' and should stop from teaching with the words 'let there be a pause'. Gaut. (I. 49-58) gives similar rules. The Gopatha Bṛ. I. 31 uses the expression 

Barve veda mukhato gļhitāḥ', which is current even in modern times ( it means all Vedas were committed to memory by word of mouth ). 

The study of the Veda was the first duty of every twice born person (dvijāti). Vedic Literature had grown to vast proportions even in the times of the Tai. Br. ( III. 10.11 ), as the story of Indra and Bharadvāja cited above (p. 271 ) shows. The ideal was set up by Manu II. 165, viz. that the whole Veda together with seoret doctrines ( Upaniṣads ) was to be learnt by every dvijāti. The Sat. Br. XI. 5. 7 oontains a eulogy of Veda study (svādbyāya) and the injunction 'svādhyāyo adhyetavyaḥ' (one must study the Veda ) occurs there very frequently. The Ap. Dh, S. (1. 4. 12. 1 and 3) quotes[^787] the Tai. A. II. 14. 3 that the study of the Veda (svadhyāya ) is austerities and also the Sat. Br. XI. 5. 6. 8. The Mahabhāśya (vol. I. p. 1) quotes a Vedic text 'a brāhmans should study and understand without any purpose ( or desire of reward) dharma and the Veda with its six angas'.[^788] The Mahabharata says that a brāhmana may be deemed to have completely accomplished his duty by the study of the Veda.[^789] Yāj. I. 40 says that it is Veda alone that confers the highest bliss upon dvijātis by enabling them to understand and perform sacrifices, austerities and auspicious sots (like samskāras ). The Mahābhāṣya (vol. I. p. 9) contains the traditional extent of the four Vedas, viz. that there were 101 śākhāg of the Yajurveda, 1000 of the Sāmaveda, 21 of the Rgvoda and nine of the Atharvaveda.[^790]

Concessions had to be made to the shortness of human life and the weakness of the human mind. Therefore Gaut. II. 51, Vas. Dh. S. VII. 3, Manu III. %, Yaj. I. 52 and others allowed a person to study only one Veda. After a man studied his own Veda, he could if so minded study another śākhā of another Veda or other Vedas. The rule laid down by many smr̥tis is that one should study the sakhā of the Veda which his ancestors studied and should parform religious rites with mantras derived from that sākha. Vide Medhātithi on Manu III. 2 and Viśvarūpa on Yaj. I. 51.[^791] That person who does not study & Vedic Sākhā studied by his ancestors and studies another śākhā altogether was called * śakhāraṇḍa'. Whatever religious rites a man did with the procedure and inantras of another śākhā giving up his own sakha becomes fruitless. But an exception was made to the effect that if some[^792] religious rite was omitted in one's śākhā, but was dealt with in another śākhā and was not opposed to the teaching of one's śākhā, it may be performed as in the case of Agnihotra ( which is not dealt with in all śākhās, but is to be performed by all ). 

Teachers mostly confined themselves to one place. But we find that even in ancient times there were teachers who wandered from one country to another. In the Kauṣ. Br. Up. IV, 1 we find that the famous Bālāki Gārgya moved about in the countries of Usinara, Matsya, Kuru-Pancāla and Kāśivi deba. In the Bs. Up. III. 3. 1 Bhujyu Lāhyāyani tells Yajnavalkya that he and others wandered about in the country of Madra for study. Students generally stuck to one teacher ; but it appears that they sometimes flocked to renowned teachers as waters flow down a slope 793 (Tai, Up. I. 4. 3). There were also students who wandered from teacher to teacher and were

therefore derisively called 'tirthakaka ( crows at a sacred place ),' as the Mahabhaṣya states.[^784] 

As the study of the Veda was & duty enjoined upon a brahmana, so teaching Veda to another was a duty. Medhātithi on Manu (II. 113 ) quotes & Vedic text 7** 'He who having studied the Veda would not teach one who requests him to do so would be one who destroys his own good aots (i.e. would lose the benefit thereof), would shut the door leading to happiness; therefore he should teach; it leads to great glory'. When Satyakāma Jābāla did not teach his pupil Upakosala anything for twelve years, though the latter served asaiduously by attending to the sacred fires of the teacher, the teacher's wife remonstrated with the busband by saying this student bas worked hard and attended the fires, may the fires not congure you and order you to teach him the vidyā he desires' (Cbān, Up. IV. 10. 1-2). The Praśna Up. 798 VI, 1 gives expression to the view that if a teacher keeps back anything he knows he dries up entirely. The Āp. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 2-3 expressly prescribes the teacher whom a student asks for instruction should not refuse him, if he finds no defect in the student.' 787 Ap. Dh, s. (I. 2. 8. 25-28 ) lays down certain excellent rules for the teacher "the teacher, anxious for the welfare of the student as if he were his son, should atten tively impart learning to the student without hiding anything from him in all matters of duty; nor should the teacher restrain the student for his own work in such a way as to cause obstacles in his study except in seasons of distress. A teacher becomes no teacher if he avoids giving instruction' (1. e, he may be abandoned ). The Dronaparva (50.21 ) says that a pupil oomes only after the son socording to the idea of those

who know dharma. If a teacher does not teach & pupil any thing even after his pupil has stayed with him for a year, the former receives all the sins of the pupil. A teacher [^798] who did not teach or was sinful was to be abandoned. Similarly a teacher, who became puffed up, did not care for what should or should not be done and took to a sinful path was to be abandoned.*9 Ap. I. 1. 1. 13 lays down that a student must stay with his teacher who performs his upanayana till he completes his study, unless the teacher himself swerved from the path of dharma and became a sinner and (I. %. 7. 26 ) that if the teacher cannot teach the subject, the pupil may resort to another teacher. 

The smrtis lay down rules about the qualifications of a student who deserves to be taught. In the Vidyāsūkta quoted in the Nirukta 80(II. 4) we see that the teacher was not to impart vidya (knowledge) to one who was jealous (or who treated vidya with contempt), was crooked and was not self-restrained and that learning was to be imparted to one who was pure, attentive, intelligent and endowed with brahmacarya ( celibacy ), who would never prove false ( to his teacher) and who would guard what he learnt as a treasure. Manu (II. 109 and 112 also ) says that ten persons deserve to be taught viz. the son of the teacher, a student who serves his guru, one who gives some knowledge in exchange, one who knows dharma or who is pure (in body and mind), who is truthful, who is able to study and retain it, who gives money (for teaching ), who is well-disposed and who is one's near relative (agnate).

on and under the control of the teacher (as Āp. Dh. 8.801 I. 1.2. 19 and Narada say) and should stay with no one but the teacher. We saw above (p. 274) that from ancient times the student had to serve the teacher by tending his cattle ( Chandogya IV. 4. 5), had to beg for food and announce it to the teacher ( ibid. IV, 3.5) and to look after his sacred fires and to learn the Veda only in the time that would be left after doing work for the gurusos, Besides these, the rules concerning his conduct towards the teacher, the teacher's wife and son, concerning the method of salutation and showing respect, the food, drinks, and actions allowed or prohibited to students are too numerous to be set out in detail. A few important ones from Gautama, Ap. Dh. S., Manu II and Yāj. I. 33 are stated below. Gaut. (II. 13, 14, 18, 19, 22, 23, 25) says that the student should speak the truth, bathe everyday, should not look at the sun; should avoid honey, flesh, perfumes, the wearing of flowers, sleeping by day, rubbing oil on the body, putting collyrium in the eyes, going in & cart, 803 wearing shoes and holding an umbrella, love affairs, anger, covetousness, infatuation, vain discussions, playing on musical instruments, luxurious baths with hot water, metioulous cleans ing of the teeth, eostatic states of inind, dancing, singing, calumny of others, dangerous places, gazing at women or touching young women, gambling, serving a low person (or doing very low work ), injury to animals, obscene or barsh talk, wine. Manu (II. 198 and 180-181) prescribes that he should not sleep on a cot and should observe complete celibacy, but if he suffers from night emissions he should bathe, worship the sun and repeat thrice the mantra 'punar mām' (Tai. Ar. I. 30). The Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 1. 2. 21-30, L. 1. 3. 11-24) contains similar rules of conduct. Ap. says (I. 1. 2. 28-30 ) that the student should not wash his limbs with hot water ( generally ), but he may do so if they are smeared with dirty and impure matter provided he does it out of the sight of the teacher and that he should not bathe in water in a sportive manner, but

should bathe in it motionless like a stick. Ap. not only prohibits for him sexual intercourse (1. 1. 2. 26 ) but ordains that he should speak with women only as much as is absolutely neces sary. The student was not to 804 laugh, but if he could not help laughing he should do so covering his face with his hands ( says Ap.). 

Gautama and Baud. Dh, S. (1. 2. 34 and 37) say that the student is to serve his teacher by following after him when he goes anywhere, he should help the teacher in his toilet and bath and should shampoo his body and take food left by him (ucchiṣta ); 505 lio should be diligent in doing work that would be pleasing and beneficial to the teacher; he was to study when the toacher called him, he was not to cover his throat with a piece of cloth, or was not to sit in the presence of his teacher with his feet on his lap, was not to stretch his feet, he was not to clear loudly his tbroat, nor to laugh, yawn or crack the knuckles; he was when called by the teacher to reply at once leaving his sest or bed and was to approach the teacher even when he called from a distance ; he should always occupy a Beat lower than that of his teacher and should go to sleep after his teacher and rise before him (Gautama II. 20-21, 30-32 ). Manu II. 194-198 and Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 5. 26 and I. 2.6. 1-12 contain similar rules. Manu (11. 199) says that a pupil should

805. The word "ucchista' is used, as exbaustively pointed out by Medhātithi on Manu VI. 80, in several song08. It literally means 'what is left out.' The most usual senses are three, viz. (1) food left in tbe plate from which one has enten, (2) food taken out in a vessel for sery ing to a person but not exhausted by being served in his plate, and (as applied to a person), (3) one who bas not washed his hands and mouth after eating food (or as applied to a plato ) the plato (not yet cleaned) from which ono has taken his meal. Vide IV. 211 for the 2nd meaning. Another meaning is : (4) one who has answered a call of nature and not yet perforinod the "purificatory acts like scamana is said to be ucchiṣta. Vide Manu IV, 142 ( for tbis and the 3rd moaning ) and V. 143 ( for 3). Sometimes the word is usod in its literal sense (vide Ap. Dh, 8. I, 1. 4. 2). Vide Manu V. 141 for anothor appli cntion of the word.

not mimic the gait, the manner of speech and the actions of the teacher. Manu (II. 200-201 ) calls upon the pupil to close his ears (with his bands or fingers) or to leave the place wbere somebody indulges in calumnies about the teacher or points out the faults in him, and states that if the pupil himself finds fault with his teacher or caluinniates him, the pupil ( in the next life ) is born as an ass or a dog. Viṣṇu Dh. 8.806 28. 26 says the same. 

Some rules are laid down as to how the brahmacārin is to deal with the hair on his head. Even the Rg. speaks of boys with several sikbās (topknot). Vide note 598 above. Gaut. I. 26 and Manu II. 219 say that a brahmacārin may either shave his entire head, or may allow all the hair to grow as matted or should keep only a tult of hair on the head (and shave the rest ).[^807] Ap. Db. S. 1. 1. 2. 31-32, Vas. VII. 11 allow only two alternatives viz. growing all the hair or keeping a tuft of hair, while Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 28. 41 says that a student may either shave the entire head or grow matted hair. One was not to untie one's sikha, while on the public road.[^808] 

One of the rules for the student was that he was not to pronounce the name of his teacher even when the teacher was not present without prefixing or affixing an honorifio addition ( such as srl, bhatta, Mcārya ). Gaut, ordains that the student should not speak of his teacher, the teacher's son or wife or of a man who has been initiated for a srauta sacrifice by their bare names80s and then says that when it is absolutely necessary

to refer to thege by name the student should not pronounce the name and gotra of his teacher as they are, but by means of a synonym (e. g. if the teacher's name is Haradatta or Deves. vara the pupil should respectively say Devarāta or Sureśvara ). Ap. Dh, 8. I. 2. 8. 15 says that even after returning home & snataka should avoid touching his former teacher with his fingers ( to call his attention), frequent muttering of something in his care, laughing into his face, calling him out loudly, taking his name, ordering him about. Manu II. 128 and Gaut. VI. 19 say that a man who has been initiated for a srauta sacrifice should not be addressed by his name, even though he be younger than the person addressing, but that one should use the words ' bhoṛ' and 'bhavat' when addressing him or speak ing about him and may refer to him by words like dikṣita &c. There are other rules about addressing or referring by name which may be set out here for the sake of completeness. The Sm. O. (I. p. 45 ) and Haradatta on Gaut, II. 29 quote a smrtiklo that one should not mention by name only one's teacher, teacher's son and wife, & dikṣit&, any other guru, father, mother, paternal and maternal uncles, one's benefactor, a learned man, one's father-in-law, one's husband, one's mother's sister. The Mahabharata says that one should not mention by name or address as 'tvam'(thou) one's elders, but one may speak of one's contemporaries or those who are younger by their names.[^811] Another vorse says that one should not mention one's own name, the name of one's guru, the name of a mean person, of one's wife and one's eldest child. 

Upasangrahaṇa consists in repeating one's gotra and name, saying 'I salute', touching one's ears, olasping the feet ( as stated above) and bending one's head while so doing. In abhivādana there is no clasping of the feet with the hands; one

Rules about saluting ( abhivadana ) 

335 

may or may not touch the feet of the person to be honoured. 

Abhivādana must always be preceded by pratyutthāna.[^813] 

Very detailed rules were laid down about pratyutthāna (rising from one's seat to receive a person), abhivadana ( salut ing a man), u pasamgrabana (saluting by clasping the feet of the teacher or another with one's hands ), pratyabhivada (returning & salutation), and namaskāra ( bowing with the word 'namah '). According to Ap. Dh. 8. I.2.5.19 and I. 3. 10. 17 the student must, when he meets bis teacher after sunrise, clasp his teacher's feet and also before beginning the day's lesson of Vedic study and also after finishing it. Manu IL 71 says the same. Gaut. (I. 52-54) prescribes the clasping of the feet every day in the morning and at the beginning and at the end of a lesson in the Veda. Acoording to Ap. Dh. S. 1.2.5.20 on other oocasions whenever the student meets the teacher only abhivādana is sufficient, though according to some teachers (Ap. I. 2. 5. 21) clasping the teacher's feet is necessary on each oocasion. Ap. Dh. S. L. 2. 5. 22 states that in upasamgrabaṇa the teacher's right foot is to be stroked below and above with the student's right hand and the foot and ankle are both to be taken hold of, while according to some teachers, the student must press each foot of the teacher with both hands and clasp them. Manu II. 72, Viṣṇu Dh.8.28.15, and Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 24 say that the student is to clasp the feet of the teacher with crossed hands, touobing the right foot with the right hand and the left foot with the left hand. Kullūka on Manu II. 72 quotes Paithinasi that the student should olasp the teacher's feet with his hands turned upwards. Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 28 adds that clasping should not be done when either the teacher or the pupil is seated, or is lying down or impure. Acc ording to Gaut. VI. 1-3 one must clasp every day on the first meeting and particularly on his or their return from a journey, the feet of one's parents, of the blood relations of parents (e. g. paternal and maternal uncles ), of the elder brother, of the guru (i. e, acārya, upadhyaya) and of persons Venerated by one's gurus, Ap. Dh, S. (1. 4. 14. 7-9) says that even after finishing

one's studies and returning home a man must every day clasp the feet of gurus (father, mother, teacher and other venerable persons ) and of elder brothers 'and sisters according to their seniority, 

Abhivādana is of three kinds, viz, nitya (obligatory every day ), naimittika (to be done only on certain ocoasions) and kāmya (to be done only if a person has certain rewards in View). As examples of nitya abhivadana one may instance the rules of Ap. Dh. 8.813 ( 1. 2. 5. 12–13) "every day a student should get up from bed in the last watch of the night and standing near his teacher salute him with the words 'I so and 80, ho' (salute thee ); and the student should also salute other very aged (and learned brāhmaṇas) who may reside in the same village before his morning meal." Yaj. I. 26 also speaks of the latter. The occasional abbivā dana is done on certain oooasions such as return from a journey (Ap. Dh. S. 1. 2.5. 14). A person may salute elderly persons whenever be chooses, if he is desirous of long life or (bliss in) heaven (Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 5. 15 and Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 26). Manu 814 ( II. 120 and 121 ) gays * the prāṇas ( vital breaths) of a young man mount upwards when an old man approaches; but by rising to meet him and salutation ( to him ), be ( the young man) recovers them. He who habitually salutes and constantly pays reverence to the aged obtains an increase of four things viz. length of life, knowledge, fame and strength. Ap. Dh. S, I, 4, 14. 11,818 Baud. Dh. 8. L 2. 44, Manu II. 130 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 41 prescribe that a person must honour by rising and mentioning one's name an officiating priest, one's father-in-law, paternal and maternal unoles, even though these may be younger than oneself in

years. Gaut. ( VI. 9 ) however says that in the case of these one need only rise from his seat to receive them; but it is not necessary to salute them (abhivadana is not necessary ). Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 32. 4 expressly says that in the case of offioiating priests and others specified by Ap. and Gaut. and who are younger, rising from one's beat is tantamount to abhivadana. Manu II. 117 says that one must perform abhivadana to a person from whom one learns secular, Vedic or spiritual knowledge of any kind. There is some difference in the words used at the time of abhivadana. Usually the words are 'abhivadaye devadatte śarma-ham[^816] bhoh' ( vide Ap. I. 2.5. 12, Gaut. VI, 5, Baud. Dh. S, I. %, 27, Vas. XIII. 44, Manu II. 122 and 124). But this mode is appropriate only if the person addressed knows how to return the salutation. Manu II. 123 and 126 and Vas. Dh. S. 13. 45 declare that in the case of those who do not know how to return a salutation (pratyabhivadana, and according to Manu in the case of women also ) one should omit the word 'bhoh and simply say 'abbivadaye aham' (omitting one's name ). Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 14. 20 similarly says that in saluting women, & kṣatriya or & vaiśya one should use & pronoun and omit one's name.[^817] 

The manner of abhivadana was as follows 3818 A brahmana shall salute stretching forward his right arm on a level with his ear, a ksatriya holding it on a level with the chest, a vaisya holding it on a level with the waist and a sūdra holding it low (up to his feet) and that the salutation shall be by joining one's hands' (Ap. Dh. 8. I. 2. 5. 16-17). The Madanapārijata adds that abhivādana is with both handa when the person to be saluted is learned, but with one hand only if he is not learned (p. 27 ) and the Sm. O. (I. p. 36 ) quotes Viṣṇu and Atri to the 

816. That is one has to take one's name in abbivādana; but ono does not take the name of the person who is saluted (Gautapia VI. 12). The Four P. 7 says that in 7 0 ( and in sufurare also ) the person waluting says

same effeot. The stretohing of the hands up to the ear &o. indicates how far the head is to be bent in each case. 

There were also other rules about honouring one's elders in the presence of one's teacher or honouring the teacher's teacher or about one's behaviour when a gentleman comes to see one's doārya and leaves him, which are here passed over for want of space. Vide Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 6. 29-32, Manu II. 205. 

A brahmapa who does not know the form of returning & Halutation must not be saluted by & learned man; he is like & sūdra (Manu II. 126). Similarly a brāhmaṇa was not to perform abhivādana to a ksatriya or a vaisya however learned the latter may be, but one should simply say 'svasti'; those who are of the same oaste should do abhivādana. 819 The Mit. on Yāj. III. 292 and Aparārka p. 1188 quote sūtras of Hārita presoribing as prāyasoitta a fast of one, two or three days respectively for a brahmaṇa galuting a kṣatriya, vaisya or sūdra and also for saluting when the persons saluted or the man waluting are in such a condition as to make them unfit for abhivādana. One should not salute with the shoes on or when one's head is wrapped up or one's hands are full (Ap. Dk. S. I. 4. 14. 19); or if one carries a load of fuel-sticks or holds a pot of flowers or food in one's hands one shall not salute, nor shall one salute on oocasions similar to the preceding (such as one being engaged in worship of manes, of fire or other gods or when one's teacher is so engaged), nor should one salute a teacher standing Very close to him (Baud. Dh. 8. I. 2. 31-32). When one is impure or the person he meets is impure ( owing to aśauca or other causes ) no salutation is to be made or returned (Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 14. 17 ). Gaut. IX. 45 says that one should not occupy a seat or perform abhivādana and namaskāra with shoes on. One need not salute a person who is not a guru or who stands in a lower or higher place than oneself (Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 14). Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 14. 23, Manu II. 135 and Viṣṇu Dh. 3. 32. 17 say that a brāhmaṇa ten years old is like a father to a ksatriya even 100 years old and so deserves salutation from the ksatriya.

Rules about abhivādana 

339 

Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 4. 14. 12 ) gives a special rule that a friendship kept for ten years as fellow citizens, a friendship contracted at school for five years, the fact of & śrotriya being three years older entitles the friend or śrotriya to a salutation. But Gaut. (VI. 14-17) and Manu II. 134 give somewhat different rules viz. contemporaries who are born in the same year are to be addressed with the word 'bhoh' or 'bhavat' and & fellow citizen who is ten years older than oneself and an artist who is five years older than oneself and a brotriya studying the same Vedic school as oneself who is three years older are to be addressed similarly. Manu adds blood relations to the list when the difference in age is very small. The Smartyarthasara p. 7 gives a long list of persons whom one should never salute viz. an heretio, & person guilty of grave sins, an atheist, gamblers, thieves, ungrateful persons, drunkarde. Vide also Manu IV. 30 and Yaj. I. 130 (as to showing no respect even by words to heretios &c). 

In the case of certain persons one was to show honour only by rising from his seat and not by abhivādana. Gaut. (VI. 9) mentions some such persons who are already referred to in note 815. Headds that (VI.10-11) even a sūdra of eighty years or more must be honoured by rising by one (even though the latter be of a higher varpa ) young enough to be his son ( but there will be no abbivādana ) and that an arya (i, e, one belonging to the three higher oastes) must be honoured by rising by a gūdra even if the latter be older (and so a vaisya must honour a ksatriya though the latter be younger). Haradatta explains that the word kūdra in Gaut. VI. 10 is only illustrative and that an old vaibya must be honoured by a young ksatriya or brābmana by simply rising from his seat and an old kṣatriya by & young brābmana in the same way. Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 2. 4. 16-18) lays down that if a brāhmaṇa who has not studied the Veda comes 88 a guest one may give him & seat, water and food but one should not rise to receive him, but should rise to recoive him if he is entitled to abhivādana on account of age (as stated in Ap. I. 4. 14. 12, and Manu II. 134 ); similarly a brāhmaṇa need not rise to receive a ksatriya or vaibya ( except on the same ground of age). 

The rules about returning a salutation (about pratyabhivada) are made somewhat intricate and obscure by the varying interpretations of commentators. Pratyabhivada consists in pronou noing a benediction in the proper form given by a gury 

340 





or other person who has been saluted. Among the oldest[^880] is the rule in Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 2. 5. 18 'when returning the salute of one belonging to the first three castes, the (last syllable of the ) name ( of the person whose salutation is to be returned ) shall be lengthened to three moras'. Vasistha's rule (XIII. 46 ) is' when the salute is returned, the last vowel ( of the noun standing) in the vocative is protracted to the length of three moras and if it is a diphthong (i. e. e or o but not of the dual number ) it becomes 'ay' or 'v'.g. 'bho becomes bhāv'. Manu II. 123 prescribes "a brāhmana should be thus saluted in return,'mayst thou be long-lived, O gentle onel' and the vowel *a' or any other vowel at the end of the name (of the person addressed ) should be made plula (i.e. lengthened to three moras) and if the name ends in a consonant, the preceding vowel 

is made pluta." 

That these rules are very ancient follows from Panini's sūtra (VIII. %. 83 ) when the salutation of a person who is not a sūdra is returned by the person saluted, the final vowel in the name ( that occurs at the end of the sentence of pratyabhivāda ) becomes pluta. The Mabābhāṣya comments on this and two vārtikas thereon say that this rule does not apply when it is a woman to whom the salutation is returned and it applies optionally when the person whos a salutation is returned is a kṣatriya or vaisya. All these rules are exemplified in the foot-note below.[^821] Ap. Dh. S. agrees with this rule of the ancient grammarians. The verge of Manu (II. 125 ) also really means the same thing; but there the word 'akāra' is only 

foot-note belo vaisya. All the whose salutation

illustrative and stands for all vowels. The ancient oom mentator Medhātithi interprets Manu so as to agree with Pāṇini and says 'in the realm of the use of words and their senses Panini has higher authority than Manu, that the pratyabhivāda words containing the benediction about long life are not stereotyped, that when a kṣatriya returns the salutation of a kṣatriya or a vaisya of a vaisya, the same rules hold good'. As a person of a higher varna was not to do abhivadana to one of lower varṇa (vide note 819 above ) there would be no occasion for pratyabhivada from the side of the latter. The verse of Manu is interpreted by Haradatta and a few others in a different manner. According to them the last vowel in the name of the person whose salutation is to be returned is pluta and then a' is added to it, and that if the vocative ends in e or o, it beoomes aya or āva ( with a'added ).[^823] This view is opposed to Panini, the Mahābhāṣya, the Kāśika, Apastamba and several writers of digests. Aparārka and the Sm. C. condemn the interpretation put upon Manu's vorse by commentators like Haradatta.8% 

What great importance was attached to the correct utter ance of the return salutation can be seen from the fact tbat one of the miscellaneous reasons assigned for the necessity of grammatical studies in the Mahābhāṣya is that (as stated in a verse) a person who returns from a journey will perform salutation to ignorant persons ( who do not know how to utter pratyabhivada) as if to women with the words 'abhivadaye

ayamaham * 80$ (i. e. grammar is to be learnt by men for fear that they may be treated as women when a person salutes them). 

Ap. Dh, S. (I, 2.7.27) prescribes that the student shall be have towards his teacher's wife as towards the teacher himself, but he shall not clasp her feet or eat the residue of her food.[^888] Gaut. (II. 31-32 ) also says the same thing and adds that the student shall not assist the wives of the teacher at their toilet or bath nor wash their feet nor shampoo them. Manu II. 211, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 37, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 32. 6 have the same rule. But Gaut. II. 33 stutes an exception that on return from & journey the student shall clasp the feet of the wives of his teacher (also Manu II. 217 and Viṣṇu Dh. S.32.15). Manu (II. 210) gives special directions 'the wives of the teacher who belong to the same casto must be treated as respectfully as the teacher but in the case of those who belong to a different caste he need only rise from his seat and salute' ( Viṣṇu Dh. S. 32.5 also is similar), and a student who is full twenty years old shall not honour the young wife of a teacher by clasping her feet ( Manu II. 212 and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 32. 13 ); but even a young student may prostrate himself on the ground for honouring the young wife of his teacher without clasping her feet (with the words ' abhivādaye amukasarmā-ham bhoh'). 

As regards women who are not wives of the teacher, the following rules deserve attention. The first rule is that married women, whatever their age may be, deserve honour (and so he must salute &c. ) according to the ages of their husbands[^827] ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 18 and Vas. Dh, 8. 13. 42). Viṣpu Dh. 8. 32.2 gives the same rule, but restriots it to wives of the same caste. Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14, 6 prescribes that the same honour must be shown to the mother and father as to a teacher i, e. their feet must be olapsed on those occasions on which a teacher's feet are to be olasped and Ap. Dh, 8. I. 4. 14. 9 extends the rule to elder sisters. Gaut. (VI. 4-8) states that the feet of the wives of (elder) brothers or of one's mother-in-law

need not be clasped on any occasion; and the feet of a paternal uncle's wife or of elder sisters need not be clasped except when one returns from a journey. But Manu (II. 131-132) gives different rules. A maternal or poternal aunt, a maternal uncle's wife, a mother-in-law are equal to one's teacher's wife and must be honoured like her; one's elder brother's wife's feet must be clasped every day if she is of the same caste, but the feet of the wives of one's other paternal and maternal relatives need only be clasped on one's return from a journey. Viṣṇu Dh. S. 32, 3 places a maternal or paternal aunt and the eldest sister on an equality with the teacher's wife. As already stated above in the case of all women the galutation is simply 'I salute' ( abbivādaye aham)' without mentioning one's name. Devala says 'the mother, mother's mother, teacher's wife and the full brothers and sisters of one's parents, paternal grand-mother, mother-in-law, elder sister and the foster mother are women who are ( to be honoured like ) gurus ', 828 

Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 2.7. 30, Vas. Dh. 8. XIII. 54, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 28. 31, Manu II. 207 require that the student will behave towards the teacher's son as towards his teacher. That this rule is very ancient follows from a passage[^829] in the Mahābhāṣyai where it is stated and a proviso is added that the student will not however clasp the son's feet nor eat the leavings of his food. Āp. Dh. 8. I. 2.7.30 only mentions as prohibited the eating of the leavings of food, but Viṣṇu Dh. 8. (28. 32-33) prohibits also the washing of the son's feet. Manu (II. 208) gives a restrictive rule that the son of the teacher deserves the same honour as & teacher, if he imparts instruction in place of the teacher (because the latter is otherwise engaged), whether the son be younger or of the same age as the student, but that the student in any case must not shampoo the limbs of the son nor assist him in his bath nor wash his feet nor eat the leavings of his food, 

From Ap. Dh, 8. 1. %. 7. 28 and I. 4. 13, 12830 it appears that the system of pupil teachers (who were called 'samādista')

obtained in anoient times and Ap. presoribes that the student shall behave towards & pupil teacher who teaches him at the teacher's command as towards the teacher and shall honour him also by clasping his feet, as long as he is giving instruction. 

Further rules are laid down about showing courtesy to a person who is not a relative or who is not a teacher &o. Ap. Db. 8. I. 4. 14, 26-29 and Manu II. 127 lay down that one should, on meeting a brāhmaṇa, ask after his health with the word 'kuśala,' a kṣatriya about his health using the word ' animaya', a vaisya by using the word kṣema (or anasta according to Āp.) and a sūdra by employing the word arogya. Thus one who is older (acoording to the rule in Manu II. 134 oited above on p. 339) should be saluted, while one who is of the same age or younger should simply be asked 'kuśala' &c. Gaut. V. 37-38 gives similar directions.[^831] Manu ( II. 129 ) enjoins that one should address a woman who is the wife of another man and who is not a blood relation as lady' ( bhavati) or beloved sister' and (Ap. Dh, S. I. 4.14.30) that one should not pass a learned brāhmaṇa without addressing him nor a woman whom he meets in a forest or other lonely place and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 32.7 says that in such circumstances he must address her (in order to assure her) as 'sister' ( if she is of the same age as himself) or ' daughter' ( if she is younger ) and mother (if she is older than himself). 

It is stated in the Udvahatattva 838 (p. 141 ), that the word grl' is to be prefixed when referring by name to a deity or a teacher, to the place of one's teacher, to a holy place or to the presiding deity of a holy place, to one who has secured Yogio siddhis or to those who have secured by saorifices the worlds of bliss; and Raghunandana adds that acoording to the usage of respectable people'ārt' is prefixed to names of such persons while they are alive.

Grounds for showing respect 

their names and of the sūdra caste the word 'dasi'. This is still the practice partioularly in Bengal and Northern India, 

The works on Dharmajāstra give very interesting rules about the grounds on which respect was to be shown to a person. Honour 838 consists in saluting a person, or rising to meet him or allowing him to walk in front of one or giving him 

& garland, sandal-wood paste on festive occasions and the like. Manu (II. 136 ) and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. (32. 16 ) say that wealth kindred, age, ( performance of ) religious rites and sacred know ledge confer title to respect, but each succeeding one out of these five is superior to each preceding one. Gaut. (VI. 18-20) is slightly different; he says 'wealth, relations; occupation, birth, learning and age must be honoured ; each later named is more important than each preceding one; but Vedic learning is more important than all (the rest)'. Vas. Db, 8. 13. 56-57 also says that learning, wealth, age, relationship and religious actions are titles to respect, but each preceding one is more important than each succeeding one. Yāj. I. 116 puts the order as vidyā, karma, age, relationship and wealth (i. e, wealth is the least ground for giving honour). Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 35 Bays that if respect is not paid to guru (parents ), ācārya, upādhyāya and ștvik ( they are arranged in descending order) one incurs sin, but if honour is not shown on the ground of learning, wealth &o. there is no sin but one loses happi. ness and success. Manu II. 137 says that a sūdra who is beyond 90 years is still & child to a learned brahmana. In order to show that Vedic learning is superior to seniority of age Manu (II. 151-153 ) narrates the story of a young soion of the Angiras gotra who taught his pitṛs and addressed them as * little sons' and whose action was supported by the gods with the romark that a man destitute of knowledge was a child and he who taught him the Veda was his father. This story is referred to expressly by Baud. Dh, S. I. 4. 47 and tacitly by Gaut. VI. 20. It is borrowed from the Tāndya Mahābrāhmaṇa 834

(13. 3. 24). Manu II. 155 clinches the argument by saying 'the seniority of brahmaṇas springs from (sacred ) knowledge, of kpatriyas from valour, of vaisyas from (the possession) of corn and other wealth and only among sūdras is age a ground of seniority'... 

Kaut. says that men deserve honour according to their learning, intelligence, valour, high birth and eminent deeds.[^835] 

One has to distinguish between abhipādana and namaskāra. In the former one not only bows but utters words like 'abbi. vādaye &c.', while in the latter one only bows and folds one's hands. The latter is done only to images of gode, brāhmaṇas, sampyāsins and the like. The Smrtyarthasāra p. 8 prescribes a fast for one day as a penance for not bowing to images of gods, sarnyāsins &o. Viṣṇu[^838] ( quoted in the Sm. C.) says that one should not salute ( abhivadana ) a brāhmaṇa, but should only perform namaskāra in all public assemblies, in sacrifices or in palaces or royal courts. The posture of the hands is namaskara is stated as follows: 'One should join the bands in the shape of a shegoat's ear in namaskāra to a learned man, one should fold the hands together in bowing to an ascetio, one should salute an ignorant man with one hand and should not perform abhi vādana to one who is younger.[^837] 

One had to show respect by circumambulating[^838] from left to right temples or images of gods, bulls, cowpens, cows, ghee, honey, sacred trees that had brick or stone platforms built round them (like asvattha) and squares (where four roads meet), a teacher who is very learned, a learned and religious brāhmana, clay from Baored places. 

One was not to approach empty-handed one's parents, acarya, sacred fires, houses and the king, if the latter has not heard of him before.[^889]

347 

A matter closely connected with the showing of respeot is that of the rules about the preference to be given on the road. This has already been dealt with in speaking of the privileges of brahmaṇas above pp. 146–147. 

One striking point about the imparting of knowledge (par ticularly Vedic ) in the ancient educational system of India Was the great prejudice against learning from books. The greatest importance was attached to handing down the Veda intact and various devices were discovered and employed for securing this end, such as the various modes of repeating the Veda only in padas, in the krama, jaṭā and other formations. Great care was taken to preserve the proper accentuation of the Vedic texts. There is a well known story how Tvastr repeating the words 'Indraśatrur-vardhas VA *840 in wrong accents caused the fire to be extinguished instead of inflaming it against Indra as he intended. This story is alluded to in the Papinlyasikṣā. The same work ( in verse 32 ) condemns one who learns from a manuscript as among the worst of learners. The Veda was to be recited not only with proper modulation of the voice to convey the accents, but the accents were indicated also by the movements of the fingers ( vide verses 43-45 of the Pāṇiniya sikṣā). All these intricate matters could be learnt only by oral instruction. 

Great controversies have raged round the question whether the art of writing was known in India in very ancient times, whether it was used for literary purposes in the times of Panini and whether the Brahmi alphabet was an indigenous product or whether it was imported into India from some foreign land. Max Muller in his ' History of ancient Sanskrit Literature' started the astounding and absurd theory that writing for literary pur. poses was unknown to Panini (p. 507). Later on that position

was given up. Then Bühler wrote his famous work on the origin of the Brahmi alphabet' mainly relying on the regem blances of a few letters of the Asokan script with an ancient Semitic alphabet and came to the conolusion that the Brahmi alphabet was derived from a Semitio script sometimes about 800 B.O. It never occurred to that learned scholar to advance and carefully examine the other possible hypotheses which any unbiassed and cautious scholar should have ordinarily advanced viz, that the Semitic script might have been derived from the Brahmi alphabet and was later on developed or both might have been derived from some unknown ancient script. All these theories are now in the melting pot on account of the seals bearing writing in some undeciphered script found at Mohenjo daro and Harappa, some of which are at least 5000 years old. So if the Brāhmi alphabet was at all borrowed, it is clear now that it was not necessary for Indians to travel so far as Westernmost Asia for that purpose. 

Oral instruotion was the cheapest and most accurate method of imparting learning. In anoient times writing materials were not easily available and written texts could not be handled easily and would have been extremely costly. Thereforo the method of oral instruction was resorted to and having been hallowed by the lapse of thousands of years it has been persisted in to the present day. Even in the 20th century after writing has been known for not less than 3000 years acoord ing to scholars like Bühler there are hundreds of brāhmaṇas who learn not only the whole of the Rgveda (about 10580 verses) by heart, but also commit to memory the pada 841 text of the Rgveda, the Aitareya Brābmapa and Aranyaka and the six Vedāngas ( which include the 4000 aphorisms of Panini and the extensive Nirukta of Yaska ) without caring to understand a word of this enormous material.

& teacher does not shine in an assembly. Vļddha Gautama 843 condemns to hell those who sell the Veda, who condemn the Veda and those who write it down. Aparārka (p. 1114 on Yāj. III. 267-268 ) quotes verses from the Caturvinsatimata which prescribe various prāgascittas for selling the Vedas, the angas ( of the Veda), the smśtis, itihāsa and purāṇa, the secret pañoarātra (system ), gāthās, nitiśāstras &o. The prejudice against using books for learning was carried so far that among the six obstacles in the path of the acquirer of knowledge, reliance on books is mentioned as one. $44 Aparārka (p. 390) quotes a long passage from the Bhavisyottarapurāṇa about the rewards of gifts of books of the epios and purānas to a brahmana or to a matha for the use of the public. A grant of the Valabhi king Guhasena I dated 559 A, D, refers to a colleo tion of books on the true dharma. 845 In the Kadambari (para 88 ) the queen Vilasavati is described as surrounded by ascetic women who held books in their hands and read itibāsa. 846 Vide under dāna and matha-pratiṣtha. 

The teacher was expected to make the student understand by explanations in Sanskrit or in the prakrits or even by employing the current languages of the various countries. 847

But a long period of brahmacarya was not unknown to the sages of the Upaniṣads. Ohāndogya ( VIII. 11. 3) declares that Indra remained as a student with Prajapati for 101 years (three periods of 32 years plus fire). The story of Bharadvāja narrated in the Tai. Br, quoted above ( at p. 271 ) states that Bharadvāja studied the Vedas three parts of his life (at least till 75 years ). The Gopatha Brāhmaṇa 849 (II. 5) states that the period of studenthood for learning all the Vedas is 48 years; that distributing that period in four portions among the vedas student-bood is for 12 years (for mastering one Veda ), that period (12 years ) is the shortest (for brahmacarya) and that one should learn of the Veda as much as one can before he is about to return from his teacher, 

Some of the grhya and dharma sūtras contain these very words of the Gopatha Brābmapa e. g. Pār. gṛ. II. 5 says 'one should observe brahmacarya forty-eight years for the (four ) Vedas, or twelve years for each Veda or until one has learnt one or more Veda'. The Baud. gr. ( I. 2. 1-5 ) has a very suggestive passage " the ancient period of studenthood was forty-eight years for ( the four Vedas ) or 24 years, or 12 years for each Voda or at least one year for each kānda ( section of tbe Vedic samhitas like the Tsi. S.) or until the student learnt (one Veda ), as life is fleeting and as there is & Vedic text 'one should consecrate ( the three ) Bacred fires, while his hair is still dark". On Jaimini I. 3.3 Sabara states the objection (among other similar matters ) that the smrtis speaking of brahın acarya for fortyeight years are opposed to the Vedic injunction that a man who has a son and whose hair is still dark should consecrate the three srauta ) fires (i.e. he must do Bo in middle life, not when his hair is turning grey). Sabara gives bis opinion that such smrtis being opposed to śruti are to

be disregarded 881 and makes fun of them by saying that some persons desirous of concealing their lack of manbood observed brahmacarya for forty-eight years and the prescriptions in those emptis to that effect are due to this fact.[^858] The very orthodox Kumārilabhatta could not tolerate this light-hearted statement of Sabara and rebukes the latter by saying that there is really no contradiction between the śruti text and the smrti passage, sinoa the smstis themselves prescribe other legger and alternative periods, since it is possible to hold that smṛtis speak of brahmacarya for 48 years only with reference to him who wants to become a samay sin immediately after brahmacarya or who desires to become a perpetual student. 8sea 

As the Vedic literature had grown to vast proportions and as it was thought necessary to preserve this ancient heritage, the ancient sages hit upon the plan of enlisting the whole population of the three varnas in the task of preservation by making it as their duty to devote as muob time as they could to the study and conservation of the Vedic literature. Therefore various alternatives were proposed viz. studying all the four Vedas for 48 years, three of them for 36 or if a man was very clever he may finish the study of tbree Vedas in 18 years or in 9 years or he should devote as much time as he would require for learning one Veda or more. Vide Manu III, 1-2 and Yāj. I. 36 and 52 for the various alternatives. Spending 12 years for Vedic 

851. As upanayana was usually performed in the 8th year from conception or birth, the period of studenthood (if it was to be 48 years) would not ond till a inan became 56. Only a householder could consec rate the frauta firea. So if the man was to marry after fifty-six his bair would be turning grey and by following the smrti rule he would run counter to the Vedic injunction. Thus smptis would be opposed to Sruti and Jaimini's conclusion in I. 3. 3 is that when that is the osso smrti in to be disrogarded.

study must have been found even in anoient times impossible for many among the brāhmaṇas and therefore the Bharadvāja gphys ( quoted above in note 850 ) allowed the alternative that one should study the Veda till the Godāna ceremony (whion as we shall see later on) took place in the 16th year. Akv. 87. sutra I. 22. 3-4 also prescribes only two alternatives for brahmacarya viz. for 12 years or as long as one could learn the Veda ( 80 Aśv. contemplated brałmacarya for less than 12 years ). Haradatta remarks on Āp. Dh. 8. I. 1. 2. 16863 that reading Ap. I. 1. 2. 12-16, I. 11.3.1 and Manu III. 1 together it follows that every one must observe brahmacarya for three years at least for each Veda and when it is said that one may observe brahmacarya till one learns the Veda, that means beyond three years for each Veda. This appears somewhat opposed to the words of Asv. and Bhāradvāja, 

Not only was the study of the Veda made an absolute duty for all persons belonging to the three higher varpas, but the study of Veda was essential for the performance of the solemn Vedic sacrifices. Jaimini[^854] lays down that it is only be who knows the Vedic portion necessary for a Vodio sacrifice, that is entitled to perform that sacrifice. 

Subjects of Study.---The study of the Veda means the study of the Mantras and the Brāhmaṇa portion of the partioular gakhā or bākhās.8The Vede was deemed to be eternal and not composed by any human author (1. e. it is apauruṣeya). Jaimini in I. 1, 6-23 establishes that the relation of word and sense is eternal and that ( in I. 1. 27-32) the Vedas are apauruṣeya. This is not the place to set out or examine the arguments. Alll dharmaśāstra writers proceed on this axiom of the eternity of the Veda. The Vedāntasūtra (1. 3. 28-29) says that the Vedas are eternal and the whole universe (including the gods ) emanates from the Veda

and reliance is placed on certain Upaniṣad passages and on Manu L 21, Santi-parva 233, 24 and other emptis. The Bṛ, Up. IV.5. 11 says that the Vedas are the breath of the great Being (i. e. the Supreme Spirit, God); in Bṛ, Up. I, %. 5 the Creator (Prajāpati) is said to have evolved all this viz. Rgveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, yajñas and so forth. The Svetagvatara Up. VI. 18 says that the Supreme Being evolved Brahmi and imparted the Vedas to him.[^858] The Sāntiparva[^857] says that speeoh in the form of Veda is without beginning and without end, from which all activities and creation proceed, and that the Vedas become latent at the periodical dissolution of the world and become manifest to the great sages again when the world is recreated. But the eternity of the Veda and apauruṣ. eyatva of the Veda were interpreted in various ways e. g. the Mahābhagya says that, though the purport of the Veda is eternal, yot the arrangement of words is non-eternal and therefore there are various sākās ( branches or recensions ) of the Veda, named Kathaka, Kālāpaka &0.[^858] 

From very ancient times the literature to be studied appears to have been rast. Vide Tai. Br. quoted above (at p. 271 ) where the Vedas have been declared to be endless. In the Rgveda itself (X. 71. 11 ) reference is made to the verses learnt by the four prinoipal priests ( hota, adhvaryu, udgātā and brahma ), it is also said that persons who studied together showed great disparity in their mental advancement (Rg. X. 71. 7) and that 00-students feel elation when their friend wins in a debate in an assembly. The Sat. Br. ( XI. 5, 7. 4-8, S. B. E. vol. 44, pp. 97-98 ) enumerates under svādhyāya' ṛks, yajus formulae, sāmans, Atharvāṇgirasah (Atharvaveda ), stihāga-purāṇa, gathāg in praise of heroes (called Nārāśarnsis)'. The Gopatha Brd hmana IL. 10 also says 'in this way all these Vedas were created together with kalpa, rahasya ( secret dootrines ),

Brahmapas, Upanigads, itihāga, anpakhyāna, purana, anugi Banas, vākovakya &o'. In the Upaniṣads frequent mention is made of the literature studied by persons before they became seekers for the knowledge of brahma. For example, in Chān. Up. VII. 1. % Nārada tells Sanatkumāra that he had studied the four Vedas, Itihasa-purana as the fifth Veda, the Veda of Vedas ( grammar), pitrya ( treatise on sraddhas ), raśi (arithmetio), daiva (portents), nidhi (finding out hidden treasures ), vākovakya (dialogue or dialectic ), ekāyans ( politics ), devavidyā (Nirukta ), brahmavidyā (metres and phonetics ), bbūtavidyā (exorcising ghosts), kṣatravidyā (dhanurveda), nakṣatravidyā (astronomy ), sarpavidya (snake charms ), devajanevidya ( arts like danoing, singing, preparing unguents &o.). The same list is repeated in Chan. Up. VII. 1. 4 and VII. 7. 1. In the Bs. Up.[^859] II. 4. 10 and IV. 5. 11 there is a similar smaller list. In the Mundaka Up. I. 1. 5 it is said that the āoārya Angiras told Saunaka who was a great householder that the four Vedas and the six angas (mentioned in note 775 above ) are inferior knowledge and that the highest knowledge is that by which the Imperishable One is apprehended. Gaut. XI. 19 exhorts the king to rely upon the Veda, dharmaśāstras, the angas, Upavedas and Purāṇa for regulating the conduct of his subjects. Ap. Dh. 8. ( quoted above in note 775), Viṣṇu Dh. S. 30. 34-38, Vas. III. 19 and 23, VI. 9-4 mention the anges of Veda. Pāṇini shows acquaintance not only with the Veda and Brāhmapas but he know anoient Kalpasūtras, Bhikṣusutras and Natasutras, secular works on various subjects ( IV. 3. 87-88, 105, 110, 111, 116). Patañjali 360 ( 2nd century B. C.) mentions how vast the field of Sanskrit literature had become. Yāj.

please the gods and manes. Fourteen vidyas are generally enumerated as in Yaj. I. 3 ( = Matsya 53. 5-6), Vāyupurāna vol. I, 61. 78, Vrddha-Gautama (p.632) and other works, viz four vedas, 6 angas, purānas, nyāya (logic), mlmāmsā and dhar. maśāstra. Some added four more to these, viz. the Upavedas of Ayurveda, Dhanurveda, Gandharvaveda and Artbagāstra (which were affiliated respectively to the four Vedas) and thus the vidyās are also spoken of as 18.86% Kālidāsa in the Raghuvamsa (V. 21) expressly says that Varatantu taught his pupil 14 vidyās. In E.I. vol. VIII. p. 287 (in an inscription of 199 Guptasamvat i. e. 517-18 A. D.) it is said about Suśarman, an ancestor of Maharaja Samkṣobha, that he knew the highest truth because of his proficiency in the 14 vidya-stbanas'. Kumārila 863 in his Tantravārtika (p. 201 ) says that vidyā-sthānas that are looked upon as authoritative in knowing dharma are 14 or 18. The Vārābagrhya (6) refers to different preparations for different people, viz. & yājñika had to study mantra and Brāhmaṇa, kalpa ( vedic ritual ) and mimāṁsa and one could study at his option grammar, the smrtis and vaktra (?) and the grotriya only committed to memory the Veda; the first two were called snātakas. Numerous grants and insoriptions testify to the provision made by kings and well-to-do donors for all branches of study. In E.O. vol. III. T N. 27 there is a grant made by the minister Perumal under the Hoysala king Viranarasimhadava in 1290 A. D. which provided that each teacher of the Rgveda and the other Vedas was to receive & salary of six gedyāṇakas of gold a year and the teacher who taught the boys to read Nagara, Kannada, Tigula (Tamil) and Arya (Marathi) was to receive the same salary. The Gadag inscription of the time of Vikramaditya VI. (1098 A, D.) refers to the founding of a school for teaching Prabhākara's system of Mimāmsā at Lakkigundi (E. I. vol. 15 p. 348 ). Vide E. I. vol. I. p. 338 ( for endow ment for teaching an astronomical work of Bhāskara). 

Even in early times & very extensive literature on Dharma-sāstra had come into existence. The literature of the epics, of kāvyas, drama, fables and romances, astrology, medicine and several branches of speculation had grown to an

enormous extent. On account of this vast literature many portions of which appealed more to the emotions and intellect than the Vedas could, the study of the Veda receded in the background and the study of subsidiary works became more popular. Therefore the smṛtis again and again raise their voice and try to impress it upon all that the first duty of a dvijāti is to study the Veda. The Maitri Up. VII. 10, though comparatively & late work, inveighs against brāhmaṇas studying non-vedic texts.[^864] Manu (II. 168 ) says that the drija who, without study. ing the Veda, bestows labour upon another lore, is quickly reduced to the status of a śūdra in this very life together with his descendants. Kullaka on this verse cites the aphorism of Saṅkha-Likhita 868 'one should not, without studying the Veda first, study another lore, except the Vedāngas and smṛtis'. Vas. Dh.S. III. % expressly quotes the verse of Manu II. 168 as Mānava sloka. The Tai. Up. I. 9 speaks of svādhyāya (study of the Veda) and pravacana (teaching it or daily repeating it) as tapas and joins these two with sta, satya, tapas, 886 dama, dama, fires, agnihotra and progeny in order to emphasize that these two are the most important and it also exhorts the student on the eve of his return home not to neglect his study of the Veda. 

The study of the Veda did not merely consist in learning the mantras by heart. Samkara in his bhāṣya on Vedāntasutra I. 3. 30 quotes a Brāhmaṇa text to the effect that he who teaches a mantra or officiates at & sacrifice with mantras of which he does not know the seer, the deity or the Brāhmaṇa (i. e. viniyoga, employment or use) falls on a stump or in a pit. 887 The Mit. on Yaj. III. 300 quotes & verse of Vyāsa to the same effect. Not only was the Veda to be committed to memory (i. e. not only was there to be pātha ) but one had also to understand

the meaning. The Nirukta (1. 18 ) quotes two verses 846 which condemn in very strong language one who only commits to memory the Veda and does not know the meaning that man, who having studied the Veda, does not know its meaning, is indeed a tree, a stump, a mere carrier of a load; he alone who knows the meaning secures all happiness; his sins being shaken off by knowledge, he reaches beaven'. Dakṣa 869 II. 34 says that the study of Veda involves five things viz. first committing to memory the Veda, then reflection over its meaning, keeping it fresh by repeating it again and again, japa ( inaudibly muttering by way of prayer) and imparting it to pupils. Manu XII. 103 says those who have committed to memory the Veda are superior to those who are ignorant of it, those who retain their Veda (i, e, who do not allow it to be forgotten ) are superior to those who only studied it (and then forgot it), those who know its meaning are superior to those who simply retain it in memory, those who perform what the meaning of the Veda diotates are superior to those who know 

its meaning'. Sabara 879 says that the real purpose of the study of the Veda is the knowledge about religious actions that it conveys and that from the mere memorizing of the Veda, no rewards are promised by those who know the lore of the sacrifices. Viśvarūpa 871 on Yāj. I. 51 says that he alone is really vedapāraga who has made the Veda his own as to the spirit ( the meaning ). Aparārka (p. 74 ) quotes a long passage from Vyāga condemning the mere memorizing of the Veda.[^878] Vide also Medhātithi on Manu III. 19.

In spite of these excellent precepts it appears that from very ancient times the Veda was only committed to memory and most men learned in the Veda never cared to know its meaning. The Mahabhārata 878 speaks disparagingly of the srotriya as having an intelleot dulled by the constant repetition of the anuvākas of the Veda. Further there was always an under current of the belief that the mere memorizing of the Vedic texts conferred great sanotity on the memorizer and removed all sing. As time went on these ideas became supreme and the neglect of the meaning of the Veda has gone so far that among many modern orthodox brāhmaṇas there is a belief that the meaning of the Veda cannot be known and it is futile to try to find its meaning. The Tai. Br. says that a man's Bins are destroyed by the Veda and by svādhyāya. In Vas. Dh, S. 27. 1, Manu XI. 245, Yāj. III. 310 and in numerous other places it is said that sins do not affect a nan who studies the Veda and that the study of Veda destroys sin. Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 speaks of about 35 groups of Vedic hymns (like the Aghamarsana, Rg. X. 190 ) by silently muttering which a man is purified of his sins; but Vas. Dh. 8. 27. 4 is careful to add that Veda study only removes such sins as are committed through ignorance or carelessness,87* Similar provision for removal of sins by the muttering of the Vedic mantras is made in Viṣṇu Dh. S. 56. 

1-27, Yāj. III. 307-309, Manu XI, 248-260 &o. 

Not only was the Veda to be committed to memory, but when learnt it was not allowed to slip from one's mind, Ap. Dh, S. I. 7. 21. 8 makes 'brahmojjha'(i. e. abandoning what is learnt) & grave sin along with drinking wine and others. Similarly Manu XI. 56 and Yāj. III, 228 also treat it as equal to drinking wine or the murder of a brāhmaṇa. 

Similarly Manu IV.163 forbids nāstikya[^878] (bolding that there is no soul or no Hereafter ) and the reviling of the Veda and in

Reviling the Veda

XI. 56 regards the latter as a grave sin equal to drinking wine, while Yai III. 288 treats it as grave as brahmabatya. Gaut. 21. 1 mentions the nāstika among patitas along with brāhmana murderer and drinker of wine. Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 37. 4 includes the reviling of Veda among upapātakas ( lesser sins ). Manu II, 11 says that he who disrespects veda and smrti by relying on syllogistic reasoning is a reviler of Veda and a nāstika (atheist) and should be excluded from social intercourse by good men. Vas. Dh. S. XII. 41 says 'to hold the Vedas as unauthoritative, to carp at the words of the søges, and to be wavering on all points lead to one's destruction'. Vide Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 71. 83 and Anusasanaparva 37. 11 for the same ( in the latter the 2nd pada is sāstrāṇām cabhilanghanam ). 

Another striking feature of the anoient educational system was the total absence of any prior agreement about fees for teaching students. So early as Bṛ. Up. IV.1.2 we find Yājñavalkya 

(Continued from last page) Survival of the soul after death and Yam. doclaros that he who does not bolieve in tho'world hereafter again and again comes within hisgrasp (2.6).

saying to king Janaka who offered to give him a thousand Cowo, an elephant and a bull ( or as Samkara explains an elephant like bull ), 'my father was of opinion that without fully teaching & pupil one should not receive any reward from him '.[^878] Gaut.877 (II. 54-55 ) says that at the end of his studies the student should request the teacher to accept the wealth that he could offer or ask the teacher what should be given and after paying or doing what the teacher wants or if the teacher allowed him to go without demanding anything, the student should take the ceremonial bath ( i. e. return home). The Asv. gr. ( III. 9. 4) has almost the same words. The Āp. Dh. 8.878 (1.2.7. 19-23 ) requires the student to offer at the end of his studies, whatever their extent may be, & dakṣiṇā obtained from proper sources to his teacher according to his abilities and that if the teacher is in straightened circumstances, to offer him a fee even by begging from a person who is of the ugra caste or from & sūdra and that after offering a fee or doing even a very strikingly good turn to his teacher he should not boast of it to others nor should he ever dwell in his mind over it. The ideal :Was that the dakṣiṇā (fee ) offered to the teacher at the end of study was simply for pleasing or propitiating the teacher and was not a complete equivalent of or compensation for the knowledge imparted. Manu ( IL 245-246 ) 88ys that the student need not give anything to the teacher till his snāna; when he is about to return home, he may offer to his guru some wealth; that the gift of a field, gold, a cow, or a horse, of even shoes or an umbrella, of a seat, corn, vegetables and clothes (either singly or together)may engender pleasure in the teacher, The Chān.

letter to the pupil, there is nothing in this world by giving which the pupil oan get rid of the debt he owes. The Mahl bharata saya ( Advamedhika 56. 21 ) that the teacher's satisfac tion with the student's work and conduct is indeed the proper dakṣiṇā,881 Yaj. L. 51 says that one should give to his teacher what he chooses to ask as dakpiṇā and Katyayana[^888] quoted by Aparārka (p. 76 ) prescribes that a brāhmana pupil may give & cow, a princely one a village, a vaibya a horse (if able to do so). It has been shown above (p. 355 ) how kings and others made gifts of lands or provided for salaries to teachers. One of the earliest record about university scholarships is contained in the Bahur ( near Pondiobery ) plates of Nfpatungavarman in which we find & grant to & Vidyasthana (& seat of learning ) for promotion of learning (E. I. vol. 18 p. 5). In E. I. vol. 15 p. 83 there is provision of 30 mattars of land for professors leoturing to ascetios and of eight mattars to teachers giving lessons to the youths in a monastery (in the times of Calukya Somes vara I at Sūdi in Dharwar District in sake 981). The Peshwa distri. buted to learned brāhmaṇas every year dakṣiṇ& which rose to 4 lakhs of rupees a short time before 1818 A. D. It may be stated that even in the 20th century there are numerous brāhmaṇa teachers of the Veda and the sāstras who. teach pupils for years without stipulating for any fee or even receiving any thing from them. 

According to Manu II. 141, Saṅkbasmpti III.2 and Viṣṇu Dh, 8. 29.2 a teacher who teaches the Veda or the Vedangas for money or for his livelihood is called an Upadhyāya. Yaj. III. 235 and Viṣṇu Dh. 9. 37. 20 and others include teaching for money (and also learning from a paid teacher ) among upapata kas ( lesser sins). Manu III. 156, Anusasana 23. 17 and Yaj. I. 223 say that he who is a hired teacher (bhrtakādhyapaka ) and he who learns from such a teacher are not fit to be invited at a brāddha. But Medbātithi (on Manu II. 112 and III. 146), the Mit. (on Yāj. III. 235 ), the Sm, O. and others say that a person does not become a hired teacher by accepting something from a pupil, but that what is condemned is making a stipulation before hand that one would teach only if a certain sum or if so much

( Ch. VII were paid or delivered,888 In distress, Manu X. 116 and Y&j. III. 4% allow even such stipulations for the purpose of securing one's livelihood, 

The Mahabharata ( Adi. 133, 2-3) shows that when Bhiṣma appointed Drona as the teacher of the Pandava and Kaurava princes he bestowed on him wealth and a well-furnished house full of corn; but there was no stipulation. 

It has been shown above (p. 113) that it was the king's duty to support learned mon and students and to see that no brāhmaṇa died of hunger in his kingdom (vide Gaut. X. 9-12, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. III. 79-80, Manu VII. 82-85, Yāj. I. 315, 333 ). So a student, when the teacher demanded a heavy fee at the end of studies, could theoretically at least approach a king for the fee. Kalidasa draws in Raghuvamga V a graphic picture how Vara tantu demanded a dakṣiṇa of 14 crores from his pupil Kautsa who approached Raghu for the same and would not take more than his requirements. Sometimes the teacher or his wife, according to legends, demanded fanciful dakṣiṇās. For example, Utanka was asked by his teacher's wife, when he urged her to take something, to bring the ear-rings of the queen of the reigning king ( vide Adiparva chap. 3 and Afvamedhika-parve 56 ). 

It would be interesting to see how far corporal punishment of pupils was allowed in ancient India. Gaut.884 (II. 48-50 ) lays down that pupils are to be regulated (ordinarily ) without beating ; but if it is not possible to control the pupil ( by words &c. ) then he may be struck with a slender rope or with a split bamboo; that if the teacher struok (the pupil) in any other way (e. g. with the hand &o.) the teacher should be punished by the king. The Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 8. 29-30 calls upon the teacher to censure (by words ) a pupil when he commits & fault and to employ according to the gravity of the offence any one or more of the following punishments till the pupil desists, viz. threatening ( the pupil), refusing to give him food, dronching him in cold water and not allowing him to come in his presence.[^885] The

. Corporal punishment of students 

363 

Mahābhāṣya[^888] (vol. I. p. 41) refers to the fact that when a pupil pronounced a wrong accent (e. g. anudatta in place of udatta ) the upadhyāya slapped him (on the back probably ). Manu VIII, 299-300, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 71. 81-82, Nārada (abhyupetyd. susrūṣā, verses 13-14) follow Gautama as to corporal punishment, but add that beating should be on the back only and never on the head nor on the chest, while Nārada further rules that the beating should not be excessive. Manu (VIII. 300) says that the punishment in case of violation of these rules by the teacher is that for a thief and (VIII. 299 ) extends the same rules to the son and the wife. Manu II. 159 recommends that in imparting instruction about the right path of conduct, one should use sweet persuasive ( not high-toned ) words. 

A few words must now be said about the education of kṣatriyas, vaisyas and kūdras. According to Gaut. XI. 3 a king should be well-grounded in the three Vedas and in Anvikṣiki (i.e.metaphysics) and in XI. 19 Gaut. says that the king has to rely for carrying out his duties on the veda, the dharmağāstras, the subsidiary lores of the veda, the upavedas and purāṇas. Manu VII. 43 and Yaj. I. 311 say that a king should be profi cient in the three Vedas, in metaphysics, in daṇdaniti (the art of government and statecraft) and in vārtā ( economio life and production of wealth). These directions were probably meant to be an ideal and very few kings ever went through all this. If any conclusions are to be drawn from the stories in the Mahabharata, we may say that princes at least hardly ever went to a guru's home, but teachers were engaged to teach them ( as Drona was engaged by Bhiṣma ) and they became proficient in military skill. Alberuni(tr. by Sachau 1888, vol. I p. 125) says that brāhmaṇas taught the veda to ksatriyas, but he is probably drawing only on the rules given in the smśtis. Kings left ecclesiastical matters to their purohita and were always to rely on him for advice. Gaut.[^887] XI. 12-13 and Ap. Dh, S. II. 5. 10. 16 require that the purohita was to be a learned man of good birth, endowed with polished speech, a fine form, middle age and high character and that he was to be well-versed in dharma and artha. Aśv. gr. III. 12 describes how the purobita is to prepare the king for battle. Kaut in his Arthasāstra after

stating several views gives his own opinion that the vidyās for a prince are four ( the same as those of Manu and Yaj. above), that after the caula is performed the prince should learn the alphabet and arithmetio and when upanayana is performed he should learn the four vidyās till he is 16 years old and may then marry (I. 5), that in the first part of the day he should have instruction in elephant riding and horse riding,riding in chariots and in arms and the latter part of the day he should devote to hearing purāṇas, stories, dharmaśāstra and arthasāstra (politics). In the Hathigumpha Inscription (2nd century B. C.) there is a reference to rūpa (currenoy ), gananā (finance and treasury accounts ), lekha (official correspondence ) and vyavahāra (law and judicial administration) as the subjects which Khāravela mastered as heir-apparent from his 15th year to his 24th ( vide E. I. vol.20 p.71 at p. 81, J. R. A. 8. 1918 p. 545, I. H. Q. vol. 14 for 1938 p. 459 ff.). In the Kadambari also Bapa shows that prince Candrāpida did not go to a teacher's house but that a school was built for him outside the capital where he learnt from his 7th to the 16th year. 

As to the education of ksatriyas in general we have hardly any directions in the dharmaśāstra works. But that there were several learned ksatriyas and vaisyas who sometimes became teachers cannot be denied. Kumārilabhatta says ( on Jaimini I. %. 2) that adhyāpana[^888] is not a special characteristic for recognising that a man is a brāhmaṇa, since certain kṣatriyas and vaisyas who have given up the observation of the caste rules also do so. 

About the education of vaisyas there is still less material. Manu X. 1 lays down generally that the three varnas ( includ ing vaisyas) are to learn the Veda, (X. 79 ) that trade, cattle rearing and agriculture are the means of the vaisya's livelihood and that (IX.328-332) the valsya should never think of giving up cattle rearing, that he should know the prices of jewels, coral and pearls, of metals and clothes, of perfumes and salt, the Bowing of seed, the qualities and defects of soils, measures and weights, the different grades of qualities of goods, the profit and loss in trade, the rates of pay for servants, various alpha. bets and the places where saleable artioles are produced or manufactured.

Education of vaisyas and sudras 

365 

Yaj. II. 184, Nārada ( abhyupetyāsusrūṣa 16-20) indicate that boys were apprenticed with master artisans to learn several filpas (crafts) like preparing ornaments 889 of gold or for learning dancing, singing &o. An apprentice was to stipulate how long he would stay with the master craftsman, that even if he learnt the craft earlier than the stipulated time he was still to stay with the teacher and work for him till the period was over, that the teacher was to give food and lodging to the apprentice and to appropriate the proceeds from his work, that if the apprentice left the teacher before the time fixed even though the teacher was ready to teach him, he was to be compelled to stay with the teacher and to be imprisoned or Bentenced to whipping by the king if he would not stay. 

As for the education of the sūdra, there are hardly any rules in the dharmaśāstras. He gradually, as stated above ( at pp. 120-121), rose in status and was allowed to engage in orafts and agriculture and so the same rules might have been applied to him as to vaisya apprentices. The sūdra oould listen to the recitation of the Mahabharata and the purāṇas as shown above ( at pp. 155-156 ). 

It appears that in very ancient times the status of Indian women as to education was much higher than in medieval and modern times in India. Several women are stated to have been the composers of Vedic hymns; e. g. Rg. V, 28 is ascribed to Vibyavārā of the Atri family ; Rg. VIII. 91 to Apālā of the same family and Rg. X. 39 to Ghoṣā Kākṣivati. The Bs. Up. II. 4. 1. shows that Maitreyi, one of the two wives of Yāja. valkya, the great philosopher of ancient India, was herself a very earnest seeker after true knowledge and she prayed to Yājñavalkya that he should impart to her such knowledge as would make her immortal.890 In the same Upaniṣad (III. 6 and 8) we find that among the several interlooutors in the court of Janaka, king of Videha, who propounded several questions for solution before Yajñavalkya, Gārgi Vacaknavi ocoupies & very prominent position. She pursued Yājāavalkya with subtle and searching questions till ultimately he was forced to warn her

not to probe too much into the nature of the First Principle which was beyond mere human reason and logical questioning or otherwise she might die by the fall of her head. Then she desisted, but her unquenchable thirst for pbilosophical knowledge again gwelled up and she put two questions to Yajavalkya hoping to confound him. In the same Up. (Bṛ. Up. VI. 4. 17 ) there is a rite prescribed 89' for one who desires to have a learned daughter. As in the very preceding sentence & prescription is given for one desirous of having a son who would master the three Vedas, it naturally follows that the learning of the daughter must refer to the same topio. But Samkara, in whose day women were debarred from learning the Vedas, could not but explain the word 'pandita' as referring to proficiency in domestic work. It has been shown above (p. 294) that upanayapa and veda study were allowed to women by Harita. In the daily rṣitarpana ( Asv. gr. III. 4) among a host of sages water is offered to three women as teachers viz. Gārgi Vacaknavi, Vadavā Pratitheyl and Sulabha Maitreyi. The very fact that the Kasika on Pāṇini IV. 1. 59 and III. 3. 21 teaches the formation of acārya and upadhyāya as meaning & woman who is herself a teacher (and not merely the wife of a teacher) establishes that the ancient grammarians were familiar with women teachers. Patañjali teaches 898 how and why & brahmana woman is called Apisala (one who studies the gram mar of Apisali) and Kaśakrtsnā (one who studies the mimanga work of Kāśakṣtsna). He also states the formation of the appellation' Audameghāḥ' (meaning the pupils of a woman teacher called Audameghyā). Gobhila 892 gr. II. 1. 19-20 prescri bes that when the bride pushes forward with her foot a mat the bridegroom should make her repeat the mantra 'may the way which my husband goes by be also assigned to me' and that if she does not repeat this mantra ( through bashfulness &o.) he

should repeat it substituting the words 'to her' for 'to me'. In the Kathaka 894 gr. 25. 23 it is said that the Anuraka beginning with 'sarasvati predam-ava' ( of 21 vorges) was to be recited both by the bride and the bridegroom acoording to some teachers. All this shows that women could recite Vedic mantras in the gūtra period. The Kāmagūtra of Vatsyāyana, 895 & remarkable though in some places & filthy work, prescribes that women should study the Kamasutra and its subsidiary angas (vim the 64 kalās such as singing, dancing, painting &o.) before they attain youth (i.e. in their father's house) and after marriage with the husband's consent. In the 64 kalās enumerated in that work (I. 3. 16 ) are included prahelikās ( riddles of words ), pustakavācana (chanting from books ), kāvyasamasyd-pūraṇa ( composing a suitable portion of a verse to fit in with a portion given ), knowledge of lexicons and metres &o. We read in the epics and the dramas like the Sakuntala of women writing messages to their lovers. In the Malatimadhava Bhavabhūti tells his readers that the fathers of the hero and the heroine studied in their youth together with Kāmandakı at the feet of the same master. From anthologies like Rājasekhara's Sāktimuktavali we learn that there were poetesses like Vijja, Sitā &o. All these facts tend to indioate that literary attainments among women were not totally unheard of in ancient India. 

But gradually the position of women became worse and worse. In the Dharmasutras and Manu woman is assigned a position of dependence and even women of higher classes came to be looked upon as equal to śūdras so far as Vedic study and several other matters were concerned. Gaut. 18. 1, Vas. Dh, S. VI. 1, Baud. Dh. 8. IL. 2. 45 and Manu IX. 3 say that women have no independence and in all stages depend upon men. We have seen (at p. 265) also that all the samskāras (except marriage) were performed in the case of girls without Vedic mantras. Though according to the Pūryamimāmsā the husband and wife were to perform Vedic sacrifices together (Jaimini VI. 1. 17-21) still women 496 were only Associated with their husbands and all the

aotions to be done by the sacrificer (yajamāna ) were to be done only by the husband except where the texts expressly requested the wife to do certain things such as examining the djya or repeat ing certain mantras (VI. 1.24), Jaimini says that the husband and wife were not equal and Sabara explains that the yajamina is a male and is learned, while the patni is a woman and has no vidya. Medhātithio? on Manu II. 49 raises the interesting question why brabmacāring when begging for alms used a Sanskrit formula (bhavati bhikṣām debi) which language ladies do not know. He replies that women can understand that vernacular words which they use being similar to Sanskrit words must be derived from them and that these few well known Sanskrit words they can easily grasp. Besides even in Vedic times there was a tendency as in many other countries to make sarcastio references to women. The Rgveda[^898] VIII. 33. 17 Bays" Even Indra said 'the mind of woman cannot be control led; and also her intellect (or power) is slight'"; in Rs. X. 95. 15 898 there is no truth in the friendship of women ; they have the hearts of hyaenas'. The Sat. Br. XIV. 1.1.3 exhorts a person studying the Madhu-vidyā not to look at 'woman, sūdra, the dog and the black bird that are all untruth'. In Manu IL 213-214, Anusaganaparva chap. 19. 91-94, chap. 38 and 39 there is severe condemnation of woman. Such ideas, and ideas about pollution and the early marriage of girls are probably responsible for the great lack of literacy among women in medieval and modern times. 

As literary education among women was in a languishing state or almost nil, the question of co-education hardly arises, There are no doubt faint indications that when women could at all devote themselves to learning, they must have been taught with male pupils. Poets like Bhavabbūti (in the Mālati madhava) envisage a state of society in which & woman (like Kamandakı) learnt at the feet of the same master along with male students (like Bhūrivasu and Devarāta, who later on became ministers of states ).

Education in ancient India

The house of the acārya where the student learnt was called do&ryakula (vide Chān. Up. II. 23. 2, IV. 5. 1., IV. 9. 1, VIII. 15. 1). The teacher who presided over a large establishment of pupils was called kulapati (e. 8. Kanva is so referred to in the Sākuntala, vide note 134 above). 

It is outside the scope of this work to show from the numerous inscriptions and copper-plate grants that have been published so far, how ancient kings and rich private persons made substantial grants to famous schools, colleges and univer sities. There were famous universities at Takṣaśilā ( modern Taxila ), Valabbi, Benares, Nalanda, Vikramasilā &c. For an account of the university of Nālandā in the 7th century reference may be made to the accounts given by the two Chinese travellers Yuan Chwang ( vide Watters vol. II, pp. 109, 246 ) and Itsing ('Records of the Buddhist Religion' by Dr. Takakusu pp. 154, 177 &c.). Most of those seats of learning were endowed. One of the earliest of such grants is that of the Pallava Nṛpatunga-varman ( Bahur Plates, E. I. 18 p. 5) whereby three villages were bestowed as a source of revenue (vidyābhoga ) for the promotion of learning to the residents of a seat of learning ( vidyāsthāna, a college ) at Vāgūr, The Kāvye mimāṁsā of Rājaśekbara ( in chap. 10) calls upon the king to hold assemblies of poets and learned men, to arrange for their examination and to distribute rewards to them in the manner of such ancient kings as Vasudeva, Sātavāhana, Sūdraka, Sābasānka. It also says that in Ujjayini such poets as Kalidāsa, Mentha, Bhāravi, Haricandra were examined and in Pataliputra (modern Patna) such fainous śāstrakāras as Pāṇini, Vyādi, Vararuci, Patañjali, Varṣa, Upavarṣa, and Pingala were examined. 

The salient features of the educational system outlined in the Dharmaśāstra works are the high and honourable position assigned to the teacher, the close personal contact of the pupil with the teacher and individual attention, the pupil's stay with the teacher as a member of his family, oral instruction and the absence of books, stern discipline and oontrol of emotions and the will, cheapness (as no fees were stipulated for). The Indian system compares most favourably with any systein of education of the West, whether in Greece or Rome or any other country. It gave to the students a more or less literary educa tion, particularly of the Vedic literature and of philosophy, grammar and other subjects ancillary thereto. The principal 

H. D. 47

effort was directed towards the conservation of the ancient literature rather than to the creation of fresh literature. In these respects it was similar to the Grammar Schools of England and to the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge as they were till about the middle of the 19th century. The defects of the Indian system were that it was too literary, there was too much memorizing, boys under it had hardly any instruction in useful manual arts and crafts, the studies were not brought in contact with practical life. The discipline was rigorous and joyless. Many of these defects were due to the exigencies of the caste system which assigned particular avocations to particular castes. We cannot and should not compare the system with the systems of education prevalent in the 20th century, when several subjects such as literature, music and the fine arts, bandicrafts, mathematios, science, history and geography are taught in the schools to all boys and when it has been recog nised that education is a prime concern of the State. 

The four Veda-vratas :-Among the samskāras enumerated by Gautama there are four Veda-vratas (Gaut. VIII. 15). These four are also included in the 16 samskāras by several smṛtis. Their names and procedure differ considerably in the several grhyasūtras. Some grhyasūtres like Pār. do not describe them. A brief reference will be made to them here. The Aśv. gr. I. 22. 20 600 says in general words that in the vratas all the ceremonies beginning from shaving the head up to paridāns ( i. e. Āśv. gr. I. 19. 8 to I. 20.7) that are performed at the upapayana are repeated each time with each vrata. And the four vratas according to the Aśvalāyana smrti ( in verse) were Mahānāmni vrata, Mahāvrata (Ait. Ār. I. and V), Upaniṣad vrata and Godāns. Each vrata is to be performed for a year. Vide Laghu Asvalāyana 11th section ( Ānan. Ed). The śān. gr. ( II. 11-12 ) describes, after the student is instructed in the sacred Gayatri, four vratas (observances ) called Sukriya (whioh precedes the study of the main part of the Rgveda ), the Sakvara, Vrātiks and Aupaniṣada vratas ( which three precede the study of the different sections of the Aitareya Aranyaka). The observance of the first of these (viz. Sukriya) lasted for three days or twelve days or one year or as long as the teacher liked and the observances of the other three were to be kept for one year each ( Sān. gr. II. 11. 10-12, S.

p. 77). At the beginning of each of these three vratas there is a separate upanayana, followed by a ceremony called Uddik ṣanikā (giving up the preparatory observances) and then the vrata is to be performed for one year. The Ārapyaka is to be studied in the forest out of the village. Manu II. 174 prescribes that at the time of the beginning of each of these vrates the student hall to put on a new deer skin, a new yajñopakita and a new girdle. The Gobhila gļhya III. 1. 26-31 (which is connected with the Sāmaveda) mentions the vratas as Godānika, Vrātika, Aditya, Aupaniṣada, Jyestha-Eāmika, each lasting for one year. It adds that some do not observe the Aditya-vrata. The godāna vrata is connected by the Gobhillya with the samskāra of godāna ( to be described below) and it prescribes certain observances for it such as removing all hair on the head, chin and lips; avoiding false-hood, anger, sexual intercourse, perfumes, dancing and singing, collyrium, honey and meat; not wearing shoes in the village. It also prescribes that wearing the girdle, begging for food, carrying & staff, daily bath, offering a fuel-stick, and clasping the teacher's feet in the morning are common to all vratas. The Godā nika enabled the student to study the Pūrvārcika of the Sā maveda (i. e, the collection of verses sacred to Agni, Indra and Soma Pavamāna ). The Vrātika was introductory to the study of the Āranyaka (excluding Sukriya sections ); the Aditya vrata to the study of the Sukriya sections; the Aupaniṣada-vrata to the study of the Upaniṣad-brahmana; the Jyestha-sāmika to the study of the Ajga-dohas. The Kh. gr. II. 5. 17 ff. speaks of the same vratas as Gobhila, Those who observe the Adityavrata wore one garment, did not allow anything to come between them and the sun (except trees and the roofs of houses) and did not descend into water more than knee-deep. The Sākvara vrata was kept for one year, or for three or six or nine. Those who observe this vrata study the Sakvarl or Mahāpārni Verses. Vārtika[^901] on Panini V.1.91. (tadasy& brahmacaryam) mentions the Mabānāmnis and teaches the derivation of Mahānāmnikam (as the period of brahmacarga devoted to the vrata of the Mahānāmnis ). There were certain peculiar observances for

this such as bathing thrice a day (Gobhila III. 2. 7-46, Kh. gr. II. 5. 23 ff.), wearing dark clothes, partaking of dark food, standing by day, sitting by night, not seeking shelter when it is raining, not crossing & river without bathing in it ( the virtue of the Mabānāmnis is centred in water). After the student has kept his vow for one-third of the time prescribed the teacher is to sing to the student the first stotriya of the Mahānāmnis 80% (viz. the three mantras, vidā maghavan, abhiṣtvam, evābi sakro) and in the same way the two other stotriyas ( each consisting of three mantras). They are to be sung to the student who has fasted, has closed his eyes, has dipped his hand in a brass vessel full of water in which all sorts of herbs are thrown and whose eyes are veiled with a new piece of cloth, the student is to keep silent and abstain from food for one day and nigbt (or three ), to stand in the forest till sunset (and return to the village in the night ), should sacrifice with mahāvyāhtiis; look at fire, clarified butter, the sun, a brāhmana, a bull, food, water and curds; then salute the teacher, break his silence and give a fee to the teacher and offer a mess of cooked food to Indra and give a dinner to the teacher and all co-students. The same rules apply to the Jyesthasāmika vrata (introductory to the study of the three Ājyadohas 808 viz. 'mūrdhānam divaḥ, tvām visve, nābhim yajñānām). The student who undergoes this has to observe certain rules throughout his life viz. he cannot marry or bave sexual intercourse with a sūdra woman, cannot eat bird's flesh, he should not restrict himself to one kind of corn or one country and should always wear two garments, should bathe in water drawn with a vessel and should not eat in an earthen pot or drink water from it. 

The Baud. gr. III.2. 4 ff says that there are vratas of one year each which precede the study of certain brāhmaṇa texts ( of the Krsna Yajurveda ); they are hotāraḥ ®, kukriyas, upaniṣadaḥ,

godānam and sammitam and it describes them in detail. For want of space all these are passed over. The Samskāra-kaustubha ( pp. 571-580 ) gives in some detail the procedure of the Malā. nāmnī vrata, Mahāvrata, Upaniṣadvrata and Godānavrata. It states that the Mahānāmnivrata is performed in the 13th year from birth and Godānavrata in the 16th. It appears, however, that these vratas gradually fell into desuetude and medieval writers often paes them over altogether or barely mention them and emphasize only the general observances of brahmacārins viz. celibacy, begging for food, avoiding honey, wine and singing &c. For example, the Smrtyarthasāra 908 (p. 6 ) refers to Savitrivrata, then tho vrata for Vedic study and then the Āranyaka vratas. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 52 ( vedam vratāni vā pāram nitrā) explains 'vratam' as simply the duties of the student already enumerated by Yāj. (among which the specifio vratas of Mabānāmni &o, do not figure). 

If the student failed in observing the specific vratas, he had to perform prāyaścitta by undergoing the prājāpatya ponance thrice or six times or twelve times. If the brahmacāri is guilty of failing in his daily duties of observing sauca and ācamana, of the performance of samdhyā prayer, of using darbho, of begging for food, of offering fuel stick to fire, of avoiding the touch of sūdras and the like, of wearing the cloth (for covering his private parts ), the loin thread, the yajño. pavita, the girdle and the staff and deorskin, of not sleeping by day, of not holding an umbrella over his head or of not wear ing shoes, or not putting on garlands, of avoiding luxurious bath, sandal paste, collyrium, of not sporting in water, of avoiding gambling, and addiction to dancing, singing and music, of not engaging in conversation with heretios, he had to undergo the penance of three krcchras ( according to Baudhā. yana ) and to perform a homa with the vyābṛtis separately and together (i. e, four oblations of clarified butter were to be offered).906 If he was guilty of other more serious lapses he

had to undergo heavier penance. The most reprehensible act in a brahmacārin was to have sexual intercourse with a woman, The Tai. Ār. II. 18 speaks of the prayascitta for such a bralımacārin who is called avakirnin. Gaut. 25, 1-2 quotes the Tai. Ār. "they (the sages 1007 say 'in how many ( deities) the avakirṇin enters; (the answer is ) he enters the Maruts with his breath, Indra with his strength, Bșhaspati with his spiritual eminence and fire with the rest (of bis senses )'" and Gautama further provides that he should kindle fire at midnight on a new moon day and then offer two ājya oblations by way of penance with the two mantras "kāmāva-'and" Kāmāyadrugdhosmi' &c., place a fuel stick on fire, sprinkle water round the fire, offer the yajñavāstu oblation (for which see Gobhila gr. I. 8. 26-29) and standing near the fire should worship fire thrice with the versesam mā siñcantu'. Baud. Dh. S. (IV. 2. 10-13) contains the same rules. Jaiminio08 ( VI. 8. 22) prescribes that ordinary (laukika) fire is to be used for the pasu to be saorific od ( viz. ass to Nirpti, which is symbolic of the stupid lapse the student is guilty of ) and Sabara quotes a Vedic passage that'a brahmacārin who has become avakirnin should sacrifice an ass to Nirfti'. Āp. Dh. S. 1. 9. 26. 8, Vas. 23. 1-3, Manu XI. 118-121, Yaj. III. 280 contain similar provisions ( Vasiṣtha allowing in the absence of an ass oblations of boiled rice with the mantras mentioned by Gautama). Manu XI. 122–123 and Viṣṇu Dh, S. 28. 49-50 prescribe that the brahmacāri so guilty should for one year wear the skin of the ass, should beg for food at seven bouses announcing to them bis lapse, should take food only once, should bathe thrice and then only he becomes pure. Manu II. 187 ( =Viṣpu Dh. S. 28. 52) prescribes similar pedance for & brahmacārl who without being ill gives up begging for food and offering fuel to fire continuously for seven days. Prāgaścitta is prescribed for loss of yajnops vita or its being torn, or its being polluted by impure tbings

like blood &c. It consists in offering homa and wearing a new one. Vide Samskāra-ratnamālā pp. 365-367 for details. 

Naisthika brahmacūrin ( perpetual student). 

Brahmacārins were of two kinds, upakurvāṇa (the student who offered some return to the teacher, vide Manu II. 245, for the word upakurvita ) and the naiṣthika 809 ( the student who remains so till his death). These two names occur in Harita Dh. S., Dakṣa 1.7 and in several smptis. Tbe word 'naiṣthika' occurs in Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 28. 46, Yāj. I. 49, Veda-Vyāga 1. 41. The idea of perpetual studenthood is very ancient. In the Chandogya 910 Up. II, 23. 1 we read that the third branch of dharma is the ( status of a ) student who stays with his teacher's family and who wears out his body to the end in the family of the teacher, Gaut. III. 4-8, Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 4. 29, Hārita Dh. 911 S., Vas. VII. 4-6, Manu II. 243, 244, 247-249, and Yāj. J. 49-50 say that if tbe student likes he may stay with his teacher till life lasts and should serve his guru and in the rest of the time repeat the Veda; that if the teacher be dead he may stay with and serve the teacher's son if he is worthy or the teacher's wife or he may worship the fire kindled by his deceased guru; he should thus wear out his body; he obtains the highest worlds of bliss and is not born again. He has to perform throughout his life the duties of offering fuel sticke, Veda study, begging for food, sleeping on the ground ( not on a cot), and of self-restraint (Bphaspati quoted in Sm. C. I. p. 62 ). 

According to Viṣṇu quoted in Aparārka (p. 72 ) and the Sm. C. "18 (I. p. 63) quoting the Samgraha persons who are

dwarfs, ill-formed, congenitally blind, impotent, cripples and those suffering from incurable diseases should become perpetual students, as they are not entitled to perform the Vedic rites and are not entitled to inherit. We saw above that Kumārilabhatta accepted this view ( vide note 852a). But this does not mean that the blind and other partially dofective people could not marry at all. They could marry if they had sufficient wealth. For example, Dbṛtarāstra, though congenitally blind, married and had song. Aparārka (p. 72 ), the Sm, C., the Madanepāri. jāta (p. 111 ), the Par. M. (I. 2. p. 51 ff) and others say that perpetual student-bood is not restricted only to the blind and the cripple, but it may be resorted to by even able-bodied men at their choice ( vide Manu II. 243-44). 

Atri ( VIII. 16 ) says 913 that if a person undertakes to be & perpetual student, but falls from that ideal, there is no prāyas. citta for that lapse. Somne interpret this as applying to one who becomes & samnyāsin and then gives up that mode of life ; while others like the Samskāra-prakāśa (p. 564 ) interpret it as meaning that the prāyascitta is double of what the upakurvāṇa would have to undergo. 

Patitasāvitrika (those for whom there has been po upana. yang and therefore no instruction in Gāyatri and who are therefore sinful and outside the pale of Aryan society ). The gphya and dharma sūtras are agreed that the time for upang yana has not passed till the 16th, 22nd and the 24th year in the case of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas and vaiśyas respectively, but that after these years are past without upangyana taking place they become incompetent thereafter for learning the Sāvitrī (the sacred Gayatri verse) Vide ĀŚv. gr. I. 19,5-7, Baud. gr. III. 13. 5-6, Ap. Dh. S, I. 1. 1. 22, Vas. XI. 71-75, Manu II. 38-39, Yāj. I. 37-38. Such persons are then called patitasāvitrika or gāvitripatita and also vrātya (Manu II. 39 and Yāj. I. 38 call them so ). These works ot also declare that the consequences of this are that no upangyana is to be thereafter performed for them, they are not to be taught the Veda, nor is any one to officiate at

their sacrifices and there is to be no social intercourse with them (i. e. no marriage takes place with them). Ap. Dh. S. (I. 1. 1. 24-27 ) prescribes that after the 16th or 24th year, the person should undergo the rules of student-bood two months just as those who meant to study the three Vedas and whose upanayana has been performed observe (viz. begging for food &c.), then his upanayana should be per formed, then for one year he should bathe (thrice if possible ) overy day and then he should be taught the Veda. This is a somewhat easy penance. But others prescribe heavier penalties. Vas. Dh. 8. XI. 76-79 and the Vaik. smārta II. 3 prescribe that one who is patitasavitrika should either perform the Uddalaka vrata or should take a bath along with the performer of an Aśramedha sacrifice or should perform the Vrātyastoma sacrifice. Both Vasiṣthaois and the Vaik. smārta explain that the Uddalaka vrata consists in subsisting on barley gruel for two months, for one month on milk, for half a month on.āmikṣā (the whey that arises by pouring curds in hot milk), for eight days on ghee, for six days on alms obtained without begging, for three days on water and in observing & total fast for one whole day. The Sm. C. (I. p. 28 ) says that this vrata is so called becauge it was promulgated by Uddalaka. Manu XI. 191 and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 54. 26 prescribe a mild pray$& citta for palitasāvitrikas, viz. three prājāpatya 96 penances; while Yaj. I. 38, Baud. gì. III. 13.7, Veda-Vyāsa I. 21 and several others prescribe only the Vrātyastoma for those who are patitasāvitrikas. Viśvarūpa 917 (on Yāj. III. 262 ) tries to reconcile these contradictions by saying that the easy penance prescribed by Manu applies to a brāhmaṇa whose upanayana is not performed before the 16th year, but whose upanayana is Bought to be performed before the 22nd year, while the Vrātya stoma is to be performed for him whose upanayana is not

performed for forty-eight years from the first prescribed period (viz. 8th year, 11th year or 12th ). The Mit. on Yāj. III. 262 also tries to introduce vyavastha ( order) in the contradictory dicta of the smrtis. According to Gaut. 21. 11, Yāj. III. 234 and others vrātyatā (being patitasāvitrika) is only an upapūtaka and Manu XI. 117 prescribes an easy penance for all upapātakas. 

Ap. Dh. S. 918 says 'if a person's father and grandfather also had not the upanayana performed for them, then they (i. e. the three generations) are called slayers of brahma (holy prayers or lore ); people should have no intercourse with them, should not take their food nor should enter into marriage alli. ances with them; but if they desire then penance should be administered to them'. It then prescribes that they have to perform the penance (observing rules of student-hood) ono year for each generation (that had not the upanayana perform od), then there is upanayana and then they have to bathe (thrice or once) every day for a year with certain mantras viz. the seven Pāvamāni verses beginning with 'yad anti yacca durake' (Rg. IX. 67. 21-27), with the Yajuṣ.pavitra (Tai, S. I. %. 1. 1=Rg. X, 17. 10), with the sūmapavitra and with the mantra called Angirasa (Rg. IV. 40.5) or one may pour water only with the vyābstis 19. After all this is done, one may be taught the Veda. Ap. Dh, S. goes further (I. 1. 2. 5-10) and days if the generations 920 beginning with the great-grand father had not the upanayana performed on them, they are called the cemetery and that if there is desire they may observe the rules of student-hood for twelve years, then

upangyana may be performed and then the person 80 desirous of upanayana will have to bathe with the Pāvamani and other verses ( as stated above), then instruction in the duties of the householder may be imparted to him (i. e. to the 4th); he cannot, however, be taught the Veda; but his son may have the samskāra performed as in the case of one wbo is him self patitasāvitrika and then his son will be one like other aryas'. Haradatta *} remarks that Āp. does not declare the prāyascitta for him whose great-grandfather's father also was without upanayana, but that those who know the dharmaśāstra should find out a proper prāyaścitta even in such cases. It is clear that Ap. contemplates cases where for three generations there had been no upanayana and the fourth generation also had not the upanayana performed at the right time and desired to have it performed for him. Pār. gives a brief rule when three generations are patitasāvitrika, their offspring (i. e. the fourth generation) is excluded from the sacrament of upanayana and he cannot be taught the Veda.' 528 So Pār. is more restrictive than Āpastamba. 

There is a famous historical example of the application of these rules. Gāgābhatta, a profound scholar of Benares, officiated at the coronation of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Enpire, in 1674 and performed the upanayana of Shivaji before the coronation, when Shivaji was about 45 years old and had even two sons. Some eminent scholars like the late Mr. Justice Telang 94have found fault with Gāgabhatta

and the other brāhmaṇas of that time; but these scholars are wrong and Gāgabbatta had bebind him weighty and ancient authorities like Ap., Pāraskara, Viśvarūpa and Haradatta as shown above. 

The Vaik, sūtra (II. 37 ) adds that in the case of the man who is himself patitasūvitrika the saṁskāras (from Garbh.. dhāna ) have to be again performed ( with Vedic mantras ) and then the upanayana is performed. 

One very important question that exercised the minds of some writers in medieval timos was whether kṣatriyas and vaidyas existed in the kali age. In some of the purāṇas it is said in a pro phetio voin that Mahāpadma Nanda will destroy the ksatriyas and thereafter rulers will be of the sūdra caste. For example, the Viṣṇupurāpa IV. 23. 4-5 says "Mabāpadma Nanda, the son of Mahānandi, born of a sūdra woman would be extremely greedy (of power) and will destroy the whole kṣatriya race as if he were another Paraśurāma; thereafter sūdras will be kings'. The Matsya 272. 18-19 and the Bbāgavata-purāṇa XII. 1. 6-9 declare the same prophecies. The Viṣṇupurāpa IV. 24.44 remarks that Devāpi, descendant of Pūru, and Manu, descendant of Ikṣvāku, stay in

But the role of a historian is entirely different. Ho must not only try to read all evidence available till the timo be writes but he must bimself ferret out all possible evidence and make soarches in places where evidence is likely to be found. Above all ho must be cautious in bis condemnations of persons long dead on the strengtb of the meagre evidenco read by him. Mr, Telang wrote the paper above referred to in 1892, but long before that Paraskara (in 1886 ) and Āpastamba (in 1885) had been translated and published in the Sacred Books of the East series. But he, though & great judge and also & great Sanskrit soboler, nowhere sbowa that he cared to see wbether fastrio rules allowed the apanaya nk of a man himself at any ago wbaterer (after some penance ). If he had seen those rules he would not beve unjustly taken to task pandits that flourished two bundred yoars beforo him and attributed irregular motives to them. It does not appear that ho mado any Boarob in the arobives of the Udaipur Durbar to see bow Shivaji traced his descent from the Sisodia clan, nor does it appear tbat he ovon went to Madbol add other places in Mabardptra whero apcient Maratha families have been holding sway for conturios. The papers recently publishod from the records of the Mudhol State amply establieb Shivaji's claim to a Rajput lineage.

Ksatriyas and Kaliyuga 

381 

Kalāpagrāma, are endowed with great yogio powers, will revive the ksatriya race when the kita age will start again after the present kali age comes to an end and that some ksatriyas exist on the earth like seed even in the kali age. Vāyu(vol. I. 32.39-40), Matsya ( 273, 56-58) have similar verges. Relying on suoh pagsages somo medieval writers stated that there were no ksatriyas in their times. The Suddhitattyao23& of Raghunandana (p. 268) after quoting the Viṣṇupurāpa IV. 23. 4 and Manu X. 43 declares that kṣatriyas existed till Mahānandi, that the so-called ksatriyas of his day were sūdras and that similarly there were no yaibyas also. In the Sūdra-Kamalakara occurs this verse 'The varpas are brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras, the first three being twice-bord; all these exist in the several yugas; but in the kali age only the first and the last remain'. Nāgesabhatta (first half of 18th century 9236) in his Vrāty atāprāyasoittanirnaya ( Chaukbamba Series ) examines all the relevant Purāpa passages and states as his conclusion that real kṣatriyas do not exist and so those, in whose families no upanayana had been performed for ten or twenty generations, are not kṣatriyas even though they rule over kingdoms and no upanayana can be performed for such kinga. It must be stated that suob views, though held by some rigidly orthodox writers of extreme views, were not shared by most writers. All the smrtis speak of the duties of the four varnas even in the kali age. Parāśara-smrti which is said to be the smrti par excellence for the kali age ( as stated in I. 24 ) does 60. Almost all nibandham kāras (authors of digests and comipentaries ) discuss the privileges and duties of all varṇas. The author of the Mitāk ṣarā, who is rightly described as the best of all nibandba. kāras, nowhere says that kṣatriyas do not exist in the kali age. Numerous kings claimed to be descended from the Sun and the Moon. Hemādri in bis Caturvargacintāmani states that his patron" was a scion of Somāvamsa ( vide H. Dh. pol. I p. 356 for quotations). The princes of Rajputana and Central India claimed to have sprung from the Agnikupda on Mount Abu, viz. of the

four clans of Choban, Parmar (or Paramāra ), Solanki (or Calukya), Padihar (or Pratibāra ). Vide Tod's Rajasthan (Madras ed. of 1873 ) vol. I chap. VII pp. 82 ff.. This theory of the Agnikulas is at least as old as 1000 A. D., since it is referred to in several insoriptions of the 11th century A, D. Vide the Vasa ntagadh Inscription of Paramāra Pūrpapala dated sam. 1099 (1042-43 A. D.) in E. I. vol. IX p. 10 and the insoription of Camupdarāja dated san. 1136 (1079-1080 A. D.) in E. I. vol. XIV. p. 295. 

This question is now largely of academio interest. Whether & person is a sūdra or a member of the regenerate classes assu mes great importance in adoption, inheritance and succession, Therefore the question, whether kṣatriyas exist in modern times, oame before the British Indian courts over a hundred years ago. In Chouturya Run Murdun Syn v. Sahub Purhulad Syn 7 Moore's Indian Appeals 18 this question was argued and the Privy Council citing the authorities on both sides set the question at rest by remarking (p. 46 ) 'Their Lordships have nevertheless no doubt that the existence of the Khatri caste as one of the regenerate tribes is fully recognised throughout India and also that Rajputs in central India......are considered to be of that class ... ... The courts in all oases assume that the four great olasses remain'. The only question that is now permissible is whether a particular caste belongs to the regenerate classes or to the sūdra class. On this the courts often differ. Vide p. 75 under Kayastha. In Maharaja of Kohapur v. Sundaram Ayyar 48 Mad. 1 it was held (in an exhaustive judgment extending over 229 pages) that the Tanjore Maratha princes descended from 

Venkaji, the step-brother of the founder of the Maratha Empire, were sūdras and not kṣatriyas. The learned judges (at p. 51) quote Telang's dictum criticized by me above (note 923 ), but refrain from expressing any decided opinion about the claim of Shivaji to be of kṣatriya descent. In Subrao v Radha 52 Bom. 497 it was held after a careful examination of autho. rities that the Marathas of Mabārāstra are sub-divided into three groups, viz. (1) the five families, (2) the ninety-six families and (3) the rest and that the first two groups are kṣatriyas. It was further held that the tests to be applied in determining the class (varna) of a particular caste are three viz. the consoiousness of the caste itself, the acceptance of that con sciousness by other castes, and lastly its customs and usages,

das, Mātibas, that were described as dasyus by the Ait. Br.. One word that is of striking importance is mlecche. The Sat. Br. (III. 2. 1. 23–24, S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 32 ) states that the asuras were defeated because they spoke an incorrect and corrupt dialect and that a brāhmaṇa should not, therefore, utter suoh a corrupt®234 speech and so should not become a mleccha and an asura. Gaut. IX 17 enjoins that one should not speak with mlecohas, impure or irreligious persons and Haradatta explains that mlecchas are the inhabitants of Ceylon and similar countries where there is no system of varpas and āśramas. Viṣṇu Dh. S. 64. 15 is to the same effect. Viṣṇu Dh. S. 84. 1-% and Saṅkha 14.30 prescribe that one should not perform śrāddba in a mlecoha country nor should one visit such a country (except on & pilgrimage ). Viṣṇu Dh. S. 84. 4 states that that country where the system of the four varnas is not in vogue is mlecoha terri tory and Aryāvarta is beyond it, while Manu II. 23 states that the mlecche country is beyond Aryāvarta which land is fit for sacrifices and in which the black deer wanders naturally. Viśva rūpa on Yāj. I. 15 quotes Bharadvāja to the effect' one should not study the language of the mlecohas, for it is declared (in the Brāhmaṇas) that a corrupt word is indeed mleccha'. Vas. Dh. S. VI. 41 also enjoins that one should not learn the mlecoha dialect. Manu X. 43-44 knew that many of the tribes called Puṇdrakas, Yavanas, Sakas spoke mlecche languages and also the language of the Aryas (mleochavācas-cāryavioaḥ sarva te dasyavaḥ smrtāḥ ). In Parāśara IX. 36 mleochas are referred to as eaters of cow's flesh. That the molecohas had affected the Sanskrit language by lending to it certain words follows from the discussion in Jaimnini I. 3. 10 whether words like pika (a ouckoo ), nema (half), Bata (& wooden vessel), tāmarasa (a red lotus) are to be understood in the sense in which mlecchas use them or certain meanings are to be assigned to them by deriving them from some root aocording to the rules of grammar, Nirukta and Nighantu and Jaimini's conclusion is that they are to be understood in the same sense in which mleochas employ them 3d Pāṇini derives the word yavanani

and Patanjali speaks of the siege of Saketa and Madhyamika by the Yavana by whom scholars generally understand Menander. Asoka in his Rook Ediot No. 13 refers to Yona kings and it appears from his reference that brāhmaṇas and bramaṇas were not found in the Yona country. A Yavanarāja Tusaspha is mentioned as the governor of Kathiawar under Aśoka in the inscription of Rudradāman at Junagadh ( E.I. vol. VIII. at p. 43). In the Prakrit Inscriptions the Yavanas are referred to as Yavana ( vide E, I. vol. VII. pp. 53-55 at Karle No. 7 and 10) or Yona or Yonaka (E. I. VIII. 90 Nasik cave No. 18). In Kharavela's inscription also the form is Yavana (E. I. 20 p. 79). In the Mahābhārata the words Yavana and Saka ocour very frequently. Vide notes above on these words. In the Dronaparya 119. 45-46 Yavana, Kamboja, Saka, Sabara, Kirāta and Barbara are mentioned as one group fighting against Satyaki. In Drona 119. 47-48 they are referred to as dasyus and as having long and flowing beards. In the Striparva 22. 11 Jayadratha is said to have had Kamboja and Yavana women in his harem. The word Yavana is generally taken as referring to the Greeks. But there are dissenting voices also. Dr. Otto Stein in Indian Culture' denies that the word ever means Greeks and Dr. Tarn in his recent work on 

• Greeks in Bactria and India' p. 254 argues that the Yavanas in the Nasik inscriptions were not Greeks but only Indian citizens of a Greek polis. The Santiparva 65. 17-22 prescribes for Yavanas, Sakas and similar tribes only the duties of obedience to parents and attendance on teachers and tending cattle and looking after agriculture, dedication of wells and making gifts to dvijas, ahimsā, satya, absence of fury, sauca, adroha, maintenance of wife and child. Atri VII. 2 puts the receiving of gifts from or eating the food of or having sexual intercourse with the women of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Khaśas, Dravidas on the same level with doing the same things with reference to nata, nartaka, svapāka &o. Aparārka p. 923 quotes Vṛddha-Yājāavalkya to the effect that the touch of Mlecohas is on the same level with that of capdala, Bbilla and Parasika. 

Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar in a very learned and scholarly paper in Indian Antiquary vol. 40 pp. 7-37 endeavours to establish that many non-Aryan persons belonging to tribes like the Yavanas, the Sakas became absorbed in the general mass of Hindu society, that even several of the princely families such as those of the Guhilots were not of pure Aryan descent and that the pride of

the purity of oaste shown by many castes is not justified by history. He, therefore, appeals to modern Indians to forget all caste-exclusiveness and pride. But this appeal will be in vain. Merely showing that non-Aryan elements were absorbed in the body of the Aryan community several thousands or hundreds of years ago will not probably lessen that pride. Such people may retort that, whatever may have happened centuries ago, for about a thousand years there has been no such fusion. There fore the appeal should rather be based on the futility of caste exclusiveness in the 20th century when owing to the exigenoles of the times any one can pursue any occupation, when a sense of one nation and one people is absolutely necessary for secur ing to Indians their proper place in the society of nations. 

The question of the re-conversion or re-entry of people con. verted to other faiths willingly or against their wishes will be briefly dealt with immediately below. 

A few words may first be said about the Vrātyastoma. The Tāṇdya-Mabābrāhmaṇa (or the Panca-vimsa, as it is called from the number of Adhyāyas) describes four yratyastomas in chap. 17. 1-4 (khandas). The meaning of many words and passages in that chapter of the brāhmaṇa is uncertain and some what cryptio. The four vrātyastomas were ekāhas (i. e. sacrifices taking one day only ). Tāṇdya 17. 1. 1 begins with the story that when the gods went to the heavenly world some dependents of theirs who lived the vrūlya life were left behind on the earth. Then through the favour of the gods the dependents got at the hands of Maruts the Sodaśastoma (containing 16 stotras ) and the metre (viz, anuṣtubh ) and then the dependents secured heaven. The Sodaśastoma is employed in each of the four vrātyastomas, the first of which ( 17. 1) is meant for all vrātyas, the 2nd is meant for those who are abhijasta ( who are wicked or guilty of heavy sins and 80 censured) and lead a vrāty& life, the third for those who are youngest and lead & vrātya life, and the fourth who are very old and yet lead a vrātya life. Some of the passages convey a tolerably clear idea of what the vrātyas were like. Those who $4 lead the vrātya life are base and are reduced to a baser stato, since they do not observe student-hood (brabmacarya) nor do they till the soil nor engage in trade. It is by the Sodasastoma that they

( Oh. VII 

can attain this ( superior status ). This shows that the vrātyas did not perform upanayana and did not study the Veda, nor did they do even what vaidyas do. Another passage says those swallow poison who eat food of the common people as food fit for brāhmaṇas, who call good words bad, who strike with a stick him who does not deserve to be beaten (or punished ), who, though not initiated, speak the speech of the initiated. The Sodasastoma has the power to remove the guilt of these. That ( in this rite ) there are four Şodaśastomas, thereby they are freed from guilt. 925 This passage indicates that the vrātyas spoke the same language as the orthodox people, but were rough in their ways and lax as regards the food they partook of. They were thus outside the pale of orthodox Aryan society and they were brought within it by the Vrātyastoma described in the Tandya. The origin of the word vrātya is lost in the mists of antiquity. The 15th Kanda of the Atharvaveda glorifies the vrātya and identifies him with the Creator and Supreme Being. The word is probably derived from vrāta ( group) and means "he who belongs to or moves in a group.' It is possible to derive the word from vrata. Originally vrātyas appear to have been groups of people who spoke the same language as orthodox aryas, but did not follow their discipline and habite. The word vrata oocurs in Rg. I. 163. 8, III. 26. 6, V.53. 11. Sāyaṇa also perceived the difficulty raised by the glorification of the yrātya in the Atharva voda 15. 1. 1 and his note is interesting, since he says that the description does not apply to all vrātyas, but only to some very powerful, universally respected and holy vrāty& who was, however, not in the good books of the brāhmaṇas that were solely devoted to their own rites and sacrifices. Katyayanaśrauta XXII. 4. 1-28 and Āp. Srauta XXII. 5. 4-14 also deal with Vrātyastoma. Kātyāyana des cribes the four vrāty astomas and adds $28 'by performing the vrātyastoma sacrifice, they should cease to be vrātyas and become eligible for social intercourse with the orthodox aryas.' The Par, gr. II. 5 quotes the last sātra of Kātyāyans with the

remark" for such persons he who desires to have the sacrament (saṁskāra of upanayana ) performed on them should perform the sacrifice of vrātyastoma and then may indeed study the Veda for a text "Bays they become eligible for (social) inter course," 927 

In the Vrātyatā-suddbisamgraba provision is made 988 for the purification of vrātyas even after twelve generations (vide pp. 7 and 22-24 ) and that work adds (p. 42 ) that the Vrātya stoma like the penance for an avakirṇin is to be performed in tbe ordinary fire (laukiks agni). It also suggests easy substi tutes for the lengthy and trying penance of twelve years prescribed by Ap. 

Hinduism has not been an avowedly proselytizing reli gion. In theory it could not be so. For about two thousand years the caste system has reigned supreme and no one can in theory be admitted to the Hindu fold who is not born in it. A Hindu may lose caste, be excommunicated and driven out of the fold of Hinduism, if he be guilty of very serious lapses and refuses to undergo the prāyasoittas prescribed by the smrtis. Gaut, 20.15 states that he who was guilty of a misdeed for which death was prescribed as a penance became purified only by dying. But Gaut, himself prescribed death ( 21.7 ) as penance only for the sins of brahmana-murder, drinking spiri tuous liquor and incest. Even as regards these three, lesser penances were prescribed by some smrtig as alternatives (e. g. vide Manu XI. 72, 74-8, 92, 108). When the sinner performed the prayascitta prescribed by the sāstras, he was to be welcomed by his relatives, who took a bath along with him in a holy river or the like and throw therein an unused jar filled with water; they were not to find fault with him and were to completely Associate with him in all ways (Manu XI. 186-187, Yāj. III. 295, Vas. 15, 20, Gaut. 20. 10-14). Vas. 15. 17 says that those who were patita were to be re-admitted to all social

intercourse when they performed the prescribed penances (patitānam tu caritavratānim pratyuddhāraḥ ). But if the sinner refused to undergo the prescribed prayascitta, then a peculiar procedure called gbatasphota (breaking a jar ) was prescribed. In such & case the sinner's relatives ( sapiṇdas) made a slave girl whose face was turned to the south thrust aside with her foot an earthen jar full of water so that all water flowed out of it, then the relatives were to observe mourning for one day and night ( as he was deemed to be dead to them) and from that day they were to stop speaking or sitting with him, and all other social interoourse and he was to be given no inberitance ( vide Manu XI. 183-185, Yaj. III. 294, Gaut. 20, 2-7). In this way the obstinate sinner went out of the Hindu fold. The ancient smrtis do not expressly prescribe any rites for bringing into the brahmanic or Hindu fold a person who or whose ancestors did not belong to it. But as Hinduism has been extremely tolerantl8a (barring a few exceptional instances) it had a wonderful power of quiet and unobtrusive absorption. If & person, though of foreign ancestry, conformed to Hindu social usages in outward behaviour, in course of time his descendants became absorbed into the vast Hindu community, 

928. A fow striking instances of roligious toleranco among kings and common people may be cited with advantage, The Pala king Mabipala I granted a village to a brūhmaga of the Vajag.noyaśêkha in honour of Lord Buddha (E. I. vol. 14 p. 324). Similarly the king Subhakaradeva who was a great devotee of Buddba (para madaugata) granted two villages to 200 brohmapas ( Neul pur grant in E, I. vol. 15 p. 1); vide also E. I. vol. 15 p. 293. The famous Einporor Harpa, whose father was a great dovotee of the Sun, and who was himself a great devotoo of siva, pays the higbost bonour to his older brother Rajyavardhana who was a very devout Buddhist (paramagaugata ). Vide the Madhuban copperplate Inscription in E. I, vol. I. p. 67 and E. I, vol. VII. p. 155. Upavadata makes largo gifts to brahmanas as well as to communities of Buddhist monka (vide Nasik Inscriptions No. 10 and No. 12 in E.I. vol. VIII p. 78 and p. 82). The Valabhi king Gubasena:who was himself a Mahespara (Saiva ) made a grant of four villages to a bhiksu-sanghe. From the Paharpur plate of the Gupta yo&r 159 (478-79 A. D.) it appears that a brahmapu and his wife deposited three dintrag with a city council for the maintenanco of the worship of arhats at a vibāra (E. I, Vol. XX. p. 59), Tho Mulgund inscription of the time of Raptrakūta Kippa II. (of 902-3 A, D.) shows that to a templo of Jina at Mulgupd a field was given by a brahmana of the Bellala family (E.I. vol. XIII. p. 190).

Absorption of non-Aryans

This process has gone on for at least two thousand years. The beginnings of it are found in the Santiparva obap, 65 where Indra tells the Emperor Māndhātr to bring all foreign people like the Yavanas under brahmanioal influence. The Besnagar column inscription shows that the Yona (yavana ) Heliodora ( Heliodorus) son of Diya (Dion) was a bhagavata ( devotee of Vasudeva ). Vide J. R. A. S. for 1909 pp. 1053 and 1087 and J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. 23 p. 104. In the caves at Nasik, Karlo and other places' many of the donors are said to have been yavanas (vide E. I. vol. VII, pp. 53-54, 55, E. I. vol. VIII, p. 90, E. I. vol. XVIII, p. 325 ). Several inscriptions state that Indian kings married Hūṇa prinoesses, e. g. Allata of the Gubila dynasty married a Hūna princess named Hariyadevi (I. A. vol. 39 p. 191 ), king Yaśaḥkarnadeva of the Kalacuri dynasty is said to have been the son of Karnadeva and Avalla devi, a Hūna princess. These and similar examples show that persons of foreign descent and their children were absorbed into the Hindu community from time to time. This absorption is illustrated in modern times by the case of Fanindra Deb v. Rajeshwar (L. R. 12 I. A. 72) in which it was found that a family in Kooch Behar not originally Hindu had adopted certain Hindu usages and it was held that it had not taken over the practice of adoption. How Hindu customs and incidents persist even after conversion to Islam is strikingly shown by the Khojas and Kutchi Memons of the Bombay Presi. dency, who though made converts to Islam several centuries ago, were held by the courts in India to have retained the ancient Hindu Law of succession and inheritance. 988b 

The problem of taking back into the Hindu fold persons who were forcibly converted to other faiths has engaged the attention of smrtis. Moslems first attacked India in the 8th century from the direction of the province of Sindh. This invasion led to the enslavement and forcible conversion of many people. It appears that Devala and other smrtikāras tackled with the problem of taking back such people. The DeFala smrti opens with a question by the sages put to Devala who was sitting on the banks of the Sindhu at ease as to how

Tho Cutobi Memoon Act ( XLVI of 1920 ) as amended by Act XXIV of 1923 now enables Cutchi Momons by observing cortain forma. lities proscribed by tbo Act to become free from the application of Hindu Law. By Aot XXVI of 1937 it is declared that the personal law will apply to all Muslims instead of customary law on going through cortain procodure prescribed by the Act.

History of Dharmasāatra 

(Ch. VII 

brābmaṇas and members of the other varpas when carried off by Mlecchas were to be purified and restored to caste. The following verses of the Devala-smṛti are very instructive on this point. Verses 7-10 declare that when a brābmaṇa is carried off by Mlecchas and he eats or drinks forbidden food or drink or bas sexual intercourse with women he should not have approached, he becomes purified by doing the penanoe of cāndrāyana and parūka, that a kṣatriya becomes pure by under. going parāka and pādakṛcchra, & vaibya by half of parāka and a sūdra by the penance of parāka for five days. Then verses 17-22 are most important *884 When persons are forci bly made slaves by Mleochas, cāndalas and robbers, are com pelled to do dirty aots, such as killing cows and other animals or sweeping the leavings of the food (of Mlecches) or eating the leavings of the food of Mlecohas or partaking of the flesh of anges, camels and village pigs, or baving intercourse with their women, or are forced to dine with them, then the penance for puri. fying a dvijāti that has stayed for a month in this way is pra jāpatya, for one who had conseorated Vedic fires (and stayed one month or less ) it is cāndrāyaṇa or parāka; for one who stays a year (with Mlecchas in this condition of things ) it is both cāndrāyana and parāka ; & sūdra who stays (in this con dition) for a month becomes pure by kroobrapāda; a sūdra who stays a year should drink yayaka for half a month. The appropriate prāgaścitta should be determined by learned brāh maṇas when a person has stayed (in the above circumstances among Mlecohas) for over a year; in four years the person (who stays in the above circumstances among Mlecobas) is reduced to their condition (i. e. becomes & mleocha and there

is no prāya citta for him)!' The Prayasoittaviveka states that after four years death is the only purifier for him.9284 Three more verses of Davala (53-55 ) also deserve considera tion 'One who was forcibly seized by Mlecchas for five, six or seven years or from ten to twenty years, is purified by under going two Prājāpatyas. Beyond this there is no purification ; these penances are meant only for him who has simply stayed among Mlecohas. He who had stayed with Mlecohas from five to twenty years is purified by undergoing two Candrāyaṇas'. These verses are apparently inconsistent with the verses cited above ( 17-22 ), but they most probably mean this that if a man only stayed among Mlecchas for 5 to 20 years, but has not done any of the forbidden things such as eating uochista or the flesh of asses &c., then he can be taken back even after so many years. This would be an exception to the rule contained in verse 22. There is no reason why the reason ing of Devala should not be extended to persons who have been in the condition stated in verses 17-22 for over four years. In the Pancadasi (Trptidipa v. 239) we have the following very significant passage**8* just as & brāhmaṇa seized by Mlecches and afterwards undergoing the appropriate prāyascitta does not become confounded with Mlecchas ( but returns to his original status of being a brāhmana) so the Intelligent Soul is not really to be confounded with the body and other material adjuncte." This establishes that the great Vidyaranya, who after Samkarı cārya, is the greatest figure among ācāryas, approved of the view that a brābmana even though enslaved by Mlecchas could be restored to his original status. 

Under Shivaji and the Peshwas it appears that several persons that had been forcibly made Moslems were restored to caste after under-going prāyasoitta (vide notes 2321-2 below for examples ). But this was done in only a few instances. 

In modern times there is a movement among Hindus called fuddhi or patitaparāvartana (purification or bringing back into the Hindu fold those who had fallen away from it). In a very few cases persons born in western countries have been taken into the Hindu fold by the performance of vrātyastoma

and other rites. But such instances are very rare and are not yet supported by the vast majority of Hindus. It has been shown above that for taking back a man who was once a Hindu but had left Hinduism, there is empti authority in Devala and others and the authority of the Nibandhakāras. 

Punarupanayana (performing upanayana again ). 

In certain cases an upanayana has to be performed again. The A$v. *** gr. (1. 22. 22-26 ) presoribes that in punarupadayana the cutting of the hair and production of intelligence (medhā janana ) are optional, there are no rules about paridana (giving in charge of deities ) and about the time ( i.e. it may be performed at any time and no paridāna is necessary) and instead of the usual Gayatri, he should recite 'tat savitur Vğạimahe ' (Rg. V. 82. 1. ). When & person in whose family one Veda is studied ( 0.g. the Roveda ) wants to study another Veda (e. g. Yajurveda ), he had to undergo a fresh upanayana. The Asv. gr. sutra is interpreted in this way by some. Hara datta on Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1. 10 says that as the Sāvitri (i, e. Gāyatri, Rg. III. 62. 10 ) is recited for all Vedas according to the Brābmana passage quoted by Ap. one upanayana is sufficient for the study of the three Vedas in succeesion, but if a person wants to study the Atharvaveda after studying another Veda, then a fresh upanayana is necessary. This is one kind of punarupanayana. Another kind of punarupanayana takes place when in the first upanayana the principal rite viz. placing his hands on the boy's shoulders and bringing the student near the teacher is left off through oversight or the first upanayana takes place in a season other than rasanta (spring) or in the dark half of a month or on a day which was anadhyāya 980 (unfit for Vedic study ) or on a galagraha (vide note 642 above) or in the latter part of the day. A tbird kind of punar upanayana is one which is by way of prāyascitta for certain sins or lapges from good conduct.31 Gaut. 23. 2-5

Punarupanayana 

393 

prescribes the penance called Taptakrochra and punarupanayana for one guilty of drinking wine (sura ) in ignorance or partaking of human urine, fæces and semen and the flesh of wild beasta, camels, asses, village cocks, and village hoge. Vas. ( 23. 30 ) also has a similar sutra. Baud. Dh. S. II, 1, 25 quotes & verse if a person belonging to the three varṇas unknowingly drinks surā ( wine ) or fæces, he has to undergo punarupanayana' and says ( II. 1. 29 ) that if a brabmacari carries a corpse ( other than that of his parents or teacher ) he has to undergo punar upanayana. Manu V. 91 and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 22. 86 prescribe the same. In the Baud. gr. paribhāṣāsūtra (1. 12.4-6) it is said that on partaking of honey, or flesh, srāddha food or food from those in impurity on birth, or the milk of a cow before the lapse of ten days or the milk of a sandhini cow, mushrooms or the resin exuded from trees, wilayana (8 product of milk?), the food prepared for a number of people in common or the food of prostitutes, & man has to undergo punarupanayana and, according to some, also if he goes to & forbidden coun try, $32 viz. Saurāstra (Kathiawar), Sindhu, and Sauvira (Sind and the territory to its south and east), Avanti ( Ujjain), Dakṣiṇāpatha ( Deccan), a brāhmaṇa has to undergo punarupanayapa (except when he goes on a pilgrimage). It then sets out the procedure ( such as & homa, putting a fuel stick of palaśa on the fire and oblations of cooked food and ajga) and adds that in punarupanayana shaving, dakṣiṇā, girdle, staff, deer-skin, begging for food and vratas do not take place. 

The Vaik. smārta (VI. 9-10) contains similar rules for punkrupanayana.838 Aparārka (p. 1160 ) quotes Paitbinasi to the effect that if a grown-up person drinks the milk of sheep or of a she-ass, she.camel or of a woman, he has to undergo punarupangyang and also the penance called prājāpatya.

It appears that from very early times Vedic studies wero stopped on various grounds. The Tai, Ār. 934 II. 15 has a very important statement on this subject. 'Indeed as to this yajña (brahmayajña ) there are two cases in which the study of the Veda ceases, namely, when the man hintself is impure or when the place is impure'. The Sat. Br. 935 has a passage in which several oocasions when Vedic study was ordinarily stopped are mentioned and it is added that those occasions do not provent the repetition of Vedic texts as Brahmayajña. "Therefore one knowing this should certainly repeat the Veda as Brahmayajña, when the wind blows, when lightning flashes, when it thunders or when there is a fall of thunderbolt, in order that yaṣatkūras may not be fruitless'. The Āp. Dh. 8. (I. 4. 12. 3. ) quotes the Vajasaneyi Brahmana ( the Satapatha ) to the effect that " Vedic study is Brahmayajña; .when it thunders, when lightning flashes, when there is a fall of the thunderbolt, when the wind blows, these are its vasatkāras ; 936 therefore when......fruitless". The Ait. Ār. (V.3.3) notes that if there be rain when it is not the season of rainfall, he should make a break by observing Cessation of Vedic study for three nights. 887 

The subject of anadhyāya is discussed in the grhya and dharmasūtras and in almost all smṛtis. It is not possible to give for want of space the differences between the several works. Among sutras and smṛtis the most exhaustive and lengthy treat ment is found in Āp. Db. 8. (I. 3. 9, 4. to I. 3.11 ), Gaut. 16. 5-49, Saṅkhāyana gļ. IV. 7 (S. B. E. vol. 29 pp. 115-118 ), Manu IV. 102-128, Yāj. I. 144-151. The subject is also treated

Anadhyāyas 

365 

at length in the Sm. C., Smṛtyarthasāra, the Samskāra kau. stubba (pp. 564-570 ), the Saṁskāra-ratnamala (pp. 327-339) and other Nibandha works. In the following an attempt is made to present a tolerably exhaustive list of anadhyayas together with a few references to tho original sourcos. 

Among tithis the following are anadhyāyas. On the first, the 8th, the 14th, 15thtithis ( Paurṇamāsi and Amāvāsya ) there was to be cessation of Vedic Study for the whole day ; vide Manu IV. 113-114, Yāj I. 146 ( in both pratipud is not expressly mentioned ) and Hārita. Patanjali in the Maha bhāsya ( vol. II. p. 386 ) refers to anadbyāya on amāvāsya and 14th tithi. There is a famous verse of the Rāmāyana 888 which shows that pratipad also was a holiday. Gaut. says that there was no holiday on the full moon days of the twelve months, but only on the full moon days of Āṣādha, Kartika and Phālguna. The Baud. Dh, S. I. 11. 42-43 quotes & verse 989 

( Vedic study on ) the eighth tithi kills the teacher, 14th kills the pupil, 15th kills learning. Manu ( IV, 114 ) has & similar verse. Aparārka 940 (p. 189 ) quotes from the Nṛsimhapurāṇa verses to the effect that tbere is to be no teaching of the Veda ) on Mabānavami (9th of Aśvina, bright half), on Bharani (i. e. the tithi when the moon is in Bharani nakṣatra after Bhadram pada full moon ), Akṣatatștiya (3rd of Vajśākha, bright half ) and Rathasaptami ( 7th of Māgha, bright half ). Similarly there is to be anadhyaya on what are called Yugādi and Man. vantarādi tithis, Yugādi tithis according to Viṣṇupurāṇa $1 and Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Aparārka ( p. 425) are Vaisakha śukla trtlya, Kārtika sukla navami, Bbādrapada kṛṣṇa trayodasi and Māgha Purnimā ( they are respectively the beginnings of the four yugas, kṣta, tretā, dvāpara and kali). The Sm. O. (I. p. 58 ) quotes the Nāradiyapurāṇa 'on the day when uttarayana and dakṣiṇāyana first take place, on Viṣuva (the two

days in the year when the day and night are equal), on the tithis when Viṣpu sleeps and awakes from sleep ( i. e. Aṣadha sukla-ekādaśī and Kārtika-sukla-ekādaśī ), on Yugādi and Manvādi tithis there is anadhyāya. The tithis on which the fourteen manvantaras are supposed to begin are quoted below. 948 According to & purāṇa passage quoted in the Sm. O. (I. p. 58 ) there is anadhyāya on Sopapadā tith is $8 (viz. Jyeṣtha sukla %, Asvina sukla 10, and Māgha sukla 4 and 12). Sometimes on the same day there are two tithis; hence the rule laid down is that if on any day a particular tithi ( which is declared to be anadhyāya) is shown in the calendar as extending for three muhūrtas at sunrise or at sunset, then the whole of that day is anadhyāya. *** 

Yaj. (I. 148-151 ) speaks of 37 talkālika anadhyāyas ( i. c. where Veda study is suspended only as long as the occasion or disturbance stated lasts). They are: when there is noise created by a dog, jackal, ass, owl, singing of sūman, playing on a flute and the cries of the distressed (these are 7); in the vioinity or presence of impure things, of a corpse, or a sūdra or antya (i. e. one of the untouchables ), cemetery, a patita (one guilty of mabāpātaka ); when the place ( of study ) has become impure or when the man himself is impure; when there is continuous flashing of lightning or continuous peals of thunder; while one's hands are wet after taking one's meals; in the midst of water, at midnight; when a violent wind is blowing; when there is a rainfall of dust, when the quarters are lit up by sudden (and strange ) lights ; at the two twilights; when there is fog; when there is a fright (caused by robbers &c.); when one is running; when the smell of something rotten or impure spreads ; when a distinguished visitor comes to the house; when one rides an ass, & camel, a conveyance (like a chariot ), an elephant, & horse, a boat, or climbs & tree or is in a desert (or barren) place.

be added. According to Ap. Dh. S. L 3. 10. 19 when wolves howl, or when there is the sound of any musical instrument, or of weeping, singing or of the recitation of a Sāman there is anadhyāya. Gaut. 16.7 mentions the sound of bāṇa (a kind of viṇā ), bber! (a drum), mṭdanga, garta (& chariot ) and the distressed. Manu (IV. 123-124) explains that when A sāman is heard, one should not study any portion of the Roveda or Yajurveda, because the gods are the devatās of Rgveda, the Yajurveda deals with men ( it enjoins actions to be done by men), Sāmaveda has the pitrs as its deities; hence its sound has sonething of the impure or uncanny about it. Āp. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 27 prescribes 94% that there should be no Vedic study as long as there are clouds when it is not the season for clouds, when there is a halo round the sun or moon, when there is a rainbow, or when there is parhelion or a star with a tail (like & fish). Gaut. 16. 19, Āp. Db. I. 3. 9. 14-15, Vas. 13. 11 say that there is anadhyāy& as long as a corpse or a cāṇdāls is in the village or town. Gaut. 16, 45 states the view of some that the Veda can never be studied in a city ; there is no Veda study as long as there is an assembly of people ( Manu IV. 108 ) or while the student is lying down or has stretched his feet or placed them on a cot or stool, or while he sits on his haunches winding round his knees and hips a piece of cloth (Manu IV. 112., Vas. Dh. S. 13. 23, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 30. 17). There is to be anadbyaya when one is answering the calls of nature ( Manu IV. 109), or when one has not yet sipped water (acamana ) after taking food, or after partaking of meat ( Manu IV. 112), wlien there is wordy argument or there is an affray or & fight or when one is wounded or when blood flows from the body ( Manu IV. 122 ) or when one suffers from indigestion or vomits or has sour eruotations ( Manu IV. 121 ). 

In certain cases anadhyāya lasts only for a portion of the day. When the wind blows by day strong enough to carry off clouds of dust (Gaut. 16. 5) there is anadbyāya during the day (but not at night even if the wind is still strong ) or when on a festive occasion like upanayana there is anadhyāya after dinner that day (Gaut. 16. 43 ); when in the morning twilight fire has been kindled for hona and there are

flashes of lightning and thunder (not accompanied by rain ) there is anadhyāya till the sun sets. Gaut. (16.3% ) prescribes anadhyāya for the rest of the day when the king in whose country a man dwells dies ; when a strong wind that was blow ing stops, there is anadhyay, for a mubūrta i. e. two ghaṭikan ( Āp. Db. 8. I. 3. -11. 28 ) or whon there is the howling of Bālāvska (hyaena ?) or & jackal moving about alone there is Anadhyāya till one gets up from sleep ( ibid I. 3. 11.29 ). 

In some cases there is anadhyāya for the whole day and night. According to Yāj. I. 145-147 there is such an anadhyaya when there is thunder at the twilight time, there is a fall of the thunderbolt or earth-quake or the fall of a meteor, when one finishes Samhita or Brābmaṇi ( of the śākhā one is studying ) or wbon one finishes the study of the Aranyaka portion of one's Veda; when there is an eclipse of the sun or moon, or when it is the firet day after the season changes or whon a person partakes of grāddha food or accepts a gift on srāddha (except in Ekoddista srāddha); when a beast, frog, mongoose, dog, snake, cat or mouse passes between the teacher and pupil ( Manu IV. 126 also ) or when the banner of Indra is raised or taken down. Manu IV. 110 lays down anadhyāya for three days when one accepts invitation for an Ekoddiṣta srāddha or when the king dies or when there is an eclipse. This last refers to an eclipso where the sun or the moon sets while still eclipsed. Gaut. 1.60 prescribes cessation for three days when dogs and others come between. This is explained as referring to the first lesson in Veda, while the words of Manu and Yāj. are held to refer to repetition. Raising the banner in honour of Indra was a festival prescribed for kings in the Kausika sūtra 140 and other works. The banner was raised usually in Bhadrapada (or sometimes in Asvina) on the 12th of the bright half when the moon was in conjunction with uttarāṣād bā, srayana or dhaniṣtha oonstellation and it was taken down in the same month on the bharani constellation ( vide Sm. C. I. p. 59 ). According to the Bșhat-Samhitā ( chap. 43 ) of Varaha this festival lasted from the 8th to the 12th day of Bhadrapada sukla. Manu (IV. 119) prescribes anadbyāya for a day and night on the Aṣtakā days "46 and on the last day of each of tbe six stus ( seasons ). 

946. The astaka loma was performed on the 8th of the dark half of tho four mooths from Margasīrfa ( &ccording to Adv. gr. II. 4, 1) or (scoording to others) of throo months of Panga, Megha and Phuguna. (laut, 18, 38-39 prescribed throo days' anadlıytya on each of the three Aptakas or a coording to some only on the last Astakt.

Anadhyāyus

In a few cases the anadhyāya was akalika 7 i. e. lasted for one day (60 ghaṭikās) from the time when the cause began to operate up to the same hour next day. Āp. Dh. S. ( I. 3. 11. 25-26) lays down this kind of anadhyāya if out of three viz, Hasbing of lightning, thunder and rain, one or two occur at a time when it is no season for rain; there is this anadhyāya for all vidyas at all times, when there is an eclipse of the sun or the inoon or there is an earthquake or a whirlwind or fall of meteors. Manu IV, 103-105 and Gautama 16. 22-23 are similar to Ap. Dh, S. 1. 3.11. 25-26 and Manu IV, 118 prescribes akalika anadbyāya when a village is thrown into confusion by thieves or there is a commotion due to & conflagration and in the case of all portentous phenoinena (such as rain of blood or stones; vide Vas. 13. 35). Gaut, (16. 47-48 ) adds that the performer of a sraddha ( whether he actually serves cooked food to brāh. maṇas or only makes gifts of money and corn &c.) has to observe this anadhyāya (vide Manu IV. 117 also). 

Anadhyāya for three days was prescribed in a few cases. If lightning, thunder and rain all appear together when it is not the proper season for them, there is anadhyāya for three days (Ap. Dh. I. 3. 11. 23). Vide note 937 above. In the utsarga and upākarana of the Vedas, on the death of gurus ( persons worthy of respect like the father-in-law), on the Aṣtakās and on the death of near agnates (like brother, nephew &c.) there is anadhyāya for three days 98 ( Ap. Dh. S. 1. 3. 10. 2-3). Gaut. (6.38-41 ) is similar to Āp. The Harita dharmasutra ®9 prescribes apadhyāya for three days on the death of one's upadhyāya, or of the king or of a śrotriya or fellow pupil, on eclipses of the sun and the moon, on the taking down of the banner of Indra and on the death of one's ācārya.

History of Dharmaśāstru 

( Ch. VII 

Manu (IV. 110 and 119 ) prescribes anadhyaya for three days on accepting invitation for eloddiṣtu śrūddha, on the death of the king, on eclipses and on upakarms or utsarga. Yaj. I. 144 contains similar rules. 

Āp. Dh. 8. ( I. 3, 10, 4) prescribes 12 days' anadhyāya on the death of one's parents and ācārya. Baud. Dh. 8. I. 11. 32 prescribes 90 three days' anadhyāya on the death of one's father. This rule must be taken as referring only to a brahmacāri. Vas. (13. 39-40 ) prescribes three days' anadhyaya on the death of one's ācārya and one day's on the death of the son or wife of the acārya. 

The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 10) mentions some occasions when apadhyaya may extend to a month, to six inonths, or a year. Ap. D. S. I. 3. 9. 1. prescribes that, when upakarma is performed on the full moon day of Srāvana, for a month thereafter ono should not study Veda in the first part of the night (he may do 80 after that at night or in the day ). 

Aparārka (1). 192 ) quotes & verse from Yamaoi that there can be po Vedic study under the shade of certain trees like Ślesmataka, Salmali ( silk-cotton), Madhuka, Kovidara and Kapitthake. 

Both Gaut. (16. 49 ) and Ap. Dh. S, I. 3. 11. 34 state that besides the anadhyāyas expressly mentioned by them there are others which may be learnt from the several smrtis and from the assemblies of learned men.95% 

It would be noticed how the number of anadhyāyas is rather too numerous for rapid and effective study. Therefore certain rules are laid down to explain what is that is forbidden on those days. 

In the first place anadbyāya may be vāoika (concerned with the loud utterance of Vedic words ), manasa ( revolving

the Veda in the mind). Baud. Dh. S. 1.953 11, 40-41 says that the rule about anadhyāya on portentous happenings for a day and night does not apply to mānase study; but even mānase study is forbidden when there is impurity due to birth or death, Gaut. 16. 46 says the same. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3. 11. 20 allows (in general) mental study (not vocal) on unadhyāya days. Vide also Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 32. 12-13. 

The Āp. Srautasūtra "54 ( 24. 1. 37) says that the rules about anadhyāya apply only to the learning of Vedic mantras but have no application to their employment in various rites, Jaimini $55 ( XII. 3. 18-19) establishes the proposition that the rules about anadhyāya being prescribed for acquisition of the Vedic mantras have no application to their employment in sacrifices. The Ap. Dh. 8. I. 4. 12. 9 has a sūtra which shows remarkable agreement with the words of Jaimini. 

We saw above that according to the Tai, Ār, the rules of anadhyāya do not apply to the daily performance of Brahma yajña (i. e. to the repetition of the Vedic texts already learnt). Maou II. 105 says that there is no concern about anadhyāya as to the lores ( the anges like grammar, Nirukta &o.) helpful to (understanding of) the Veda, the obligatory syadhyaya (i. 0. brahmayajña) and the mantras to be used in homa. Saunaka 958 quoted in the Sm, C. says there is no anadhyāya as to repeating the Vedic texts in the obligatory rites and in japa nor in kāmya rites, in sacrifices or in the pārāyapa (repeating the Veda already learnt); the anadhyāya rules apply only to the first learning of Vedic mantras and to their teaching. The Smrtyar thasāra 97 (p. 10 ) says that those who have a slippery memory or those who have to commit to memory extensive Vedic texts

should study the Vedāngas, nyāya (logio ), mimāṁsā and dharmaśāstras on all anadhyayas except on 1st, 8th, 14th and full moon and new moon days. Some digests quote a verse from the Kurmapurana[^958] that there is no anadhyāya for the study of Vedāngas, of itibāsa, purānas, dharmaśāstras and other sāstras ; but on parva days the study of even these should be dropped. This shows that these tithis were the only close holidays on which there was complete cessation of all study, whether Vedic or non-Vedic, That is, these were what are called nitya holidays while the rest are naimittika anadhyāyas. Even now these nitya anadhyāyas are observed by vaidikas and by Pandits in their Sanskrit schools ( particularly amāvāsyā). 

It will be seen that though some of the occasions for anadhyāya are somewhat strange and bizarre, underlying most of them there are reasonable and understandable principles. Vedic study depended in the first place on memo rizing Committing sacred texts to memory (without in most Cases understanding their meaning ) required cloge attention and concentration. Therefore, all occasions which caused dis turbance or distraction of mind were held to be anadhyāyas. But the same concentration was not necessary for reciting in sacrifices or jape or brahma-yajña what had already been committed to memory. Hence such occasions were not anadhyāyas for those purposes. 

It was believed that's if a person taugbt the Vedic lore or studied it on anadhyāya days, he incurred loss as to ( long ) life, offspring, cattle, intelligence and the merit accumulated by him, 

Kesānta or godāna :-Tuis sainskāra consists in shaviug the head and also the hair on the other parts of the body ( such as arm-pits, chin). Pār. gr., Yaj. ( I. 36 ) and Manu (II. 65 ) employ the word keśānta, while Aśv. gr., San. gr., Gobhila and other grhyasūtras employ the word godāna.

of a sacrifice ) the word godana is used in the sense of a portion of the hair (on the head) near the top of the ear. Most emptikāras say that this samskāra was performed in the 16th year. According to San. gs. (I. 28. 20, S. B. E. vol. 29, p. 57 ) it may be performed in the 16th or 18th year. According to Manu II. 65 kesānta is performed in the 16th, 22nd or 24th year respectively for a brābmana, kṣatriya or vaisya. The Laghu-Aśvalāyana smrti XIV. 1 says that Godāna may be performed in the 16th year or at the time of marriage. This last view seems to have been known to Bhavabhūti who in his Uttararāmacarita 36( Act. I) makes the heroine Sitā say that Rāma and his three brothers had the godāna ceremony per formed immediately before their marriage. It is somewhat strange that according to the Kausika būtra 868 (54. 15 ) godāna precedes cūdākarma and the commentator Kesaya remarks that godāna takes place at the end of the first or 2nd year ( from birth ). 

There is great divergence of views about the starting point from which 16 years are to be calculated. The Baud. Dh. S. ( 1. 2.7 ) has stated the rule in general terms that the number of years is to be calculated from the time of conception.963 Following this rule the Mit. on Yāj. I. 36 and Kullūka on Man II. 65 say that godāna should be performed in the 16th year from conception in the case of brahmaṇas, "4 while Aparārka says that it is to be performed in the 16th year from birth. Viśvarūpa 90% on Yāj. I. 36 says that whatever the period of brahmacarya that a student was going to observe ( whether 12, 24, 36, 48 &c.) keśānta must be performed in the 16th year and if any one had his upanayana performed later than the 16th year, then kesānta will not take place at all. Nārāyapa on Aøy. gr. I. 22. 3 notes that according to some godana takes

place in the 16th year from upanayana, while others celebrate it in the 16th year from birth, 

All sūtrakāras are agreed that godāne or keśānta follows the procedure of cūdākarana with a few differences. The Asv. gr. ( I. 18. 1-9 ) points these out. Caula is performed in the 3rd year, while godāna is performed in the 16th, Aśv. gr. further says " wherever the word keśa occurs ( in the mantras or proce dure of caula ) he should employ the word smagru ( beard). He moistens the beard here. (The mantra is)'purify his head and face, but do not deprive him of life. He gives orders ( to the barber ) * arrange his beard, the bair of his body and his nails, ending in the north'. Having bathed and stood up silently during the rest of the day, he should break his silence in the presence of his teacher (saying to the teacher) 'I give a gift'. The fee is a pair of COWB. Let the teacher instruct him to keep the observances for & year" 988 Nārāyana notes that being grown up he should not sit on his mother's lap as in caula (but sit to her right) and that the instruction is to be on the next day, Nārāyana says that the instruction referred to is the one men tioned in Āśv. gṛ. I. 22. 20 from 'cutting the hair to giving in charge' i. e. from Aśv, gr. I. 19. 8. to I. 20.7. It is better to hold as Pār. and Bhār. gs. ordain that the instruction is as to brahmacaryavrata (mentioned $67 in Āsv. gr. I. 22. 17) or that he is not to shave himself for a year, 12 days, 6 days or at least 3 days. Par. gr., Śankhāyana and several others allowed the fee of only one cow 368. Gobbila ( III. 1. 5) and Khadira (II.5.3) allowed optionally the gift of a pair of horses or a pair of sheep for kṣatriyas or vaisyas respectively. According to

Keśānta or Godāna 

Gobhila and Khādira shaving the beard precedes a vrata called godānika for one year and both state at length the observances of that vrate (Gobhila III. 1. 11-29, Kbādira II. 5. 7-16). 

Sāñ. gr. (I. 28. 22) expressly says that the keśānta ceremony is performed for girls but silently. Āp. gf. 16.15, Hir. gr. 6. 16, Bhāradyāja gr. I. 10, Baud. gr. III. 2. 55 prescribe in godāna the removal of all the hair on the head (including the sikhā top-knot), while in caula it is not so. 

This samskāra gradually went out of vogue, so much so that most of the medieval digests like the Sm.C., the Samskārapraksa, and the Nirnayasindhu contain hardly anything about it. 

Snāna or Samāvartana :-( Taking the ceremonial bath after finishing Vedic study and returning from the teacher's house). Some gūtrakāras such as Gaut. (VIII, 16), Ap. gr. XII. 1, Hir. gr. 9. 1 and Yāj. I. 51 employ the word "snāna' for this eamskāra, while Ásv. gr. III. 8. 1, Baud. gp. (II. 6. 1), Āp. Dh. 8. I. 2. 7. 15 and 31, Bhār, gr. II. 18 employ the word samāvartana. The Khadira gr. (1. 3. 2-3, III. 1. 1) and Gobhila III. 4. 7 use the word 'āplavana' (which means snāna ). Manu ( III, 4) uses both 'snāna' and 'samavartana' in "a duija being permitted by his teacher, may take the ceremonial bath and return from his teacher according to the rules laid down (in his own gļhyasūtra ) and then marry a & girl &o". Aparārka ( p. 76 ) explains this verse by saying that it makes a distinction between enāna and samāvartana. The distinction consists in this : snana or ceremonial bath indicates the completion of the period of student-hood. A man who wants to remain a brahmacārin all his life need not undergo this samskāra. Samāvartana literally means 'return from the teacher's house to one's home'. If a boy learns under his own father, then literally speaking there will be no return in his case from a teacher's house. Medhātithio' (on Manu III. 4) puts this position forcibly. Samā vartana is not a necessary anga ( adjunct ) of marriage and therefore he who learnt the Veda in his father's house may, though there is no return ( to the father's house from the teacher's house ), enter on matrimony. Some hold that Samāvartana is an anga of marriage and consists

in the ceremonial bath. If it be said that the gerundial termination (tva in snātvā in Manu III. 4 ) conveys distinotion between spāna and samāvartana, the reply is that Manu will later on speak of samāvartana as the samskāra of snāna. 

Ap. gr. 12. 1 begins its treatment with the words 'vedam adhitya snāsyan' (after learning the Veda and when about to undergo the ceremonial bath ).' Having these words in mind Baud. gr. 970 (II 6. 1) remarks that in the words 'vedam adbitya snāsyan' it is samāvartana that has been described. Hence the essence of samāvartana is the ceremonial bath and return to the parental home is a subsidiary matter (which may or may not occur in the case of a student). The Mahabhasya (vol. I. p. 384) says that a person after he bas studied the Veda and taken the ceremonial bath with the permission of the teacher should begin to use a cot (for sleeping on). 

In the Vedic Literature both words are used. In the Chandogya Upaniṣad 91 IV. 10. 1 we read that Upakosala Kamalāyana became a student of Satyakama Jābāla and tended his teacher's fires for twelve years; the teacher while making his other pupils return( to their parental home ) did not make Upako sala return. Here it is clear that the Upaniṣad knew the term *samāvartana'. Similarly in Chāndogya VIII, 15 it is stated that 'having studied the Veda according to the rules in the time that was left after doing work for the teacher and having returned from the teacher's house to his own family'. On the other hand the Sat. Br. (XI. 3. 3. 7) says that one 974 should not beg after taking the ceremonial bath'. The Sat. Br. (XII. 1. 1. 10) distinguishes 078 & snataka from & brabmacārin (8. B, E. vol. 44 p. 137). Similarly the Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 13 quotes a Brāh. mana passage therefore the face of the snātaka is as if resplen dent with fire'. The Ait. Ār.

has not studied this (mabā vrata) does not become a (true) snataka, oven though he may have learnt a good deal else.' 10. ANS The Aśr. gr. III. 9. 8 summarises & Brahman& passage to the 

Swiss effect that a snātaka is indeed a great being, 

Snana (the ceremonial bath ) was ordained by the sūtrakāras after a student finishesd bis Vedic study. The Āśv. gp. (III.9.4) remarks “after having finished ( the task of learning) vidyā, they should invite his teacher to name the gift (of wealth or other wise) he desired or when the pupil has been permitted by the teacher, the pupil may take a ceremonial bath, 975 This shows that one may perform snāna either when he had finished his Vedic and other studies or he may do so even without finishing his intended studies, if the teacher permitted him to do so. The Pār. gr. II. 6 is more explicit The student should take the ceremonial bath after finisbing (the study of) the Veda or when he has gone through the period of student-bood for 48 years, or for 12 years according to some ( teachers); (he should) take the bath when permitted by the teacher,' A person who has taken the ceremonial bath is called a snūlaka. A snātaka is said by the Pār. 85. (II. 5),976 Gobbila (III. 5. 21-22), Baud. Er. paribhāṣā gūtra I. 15, Hārita and others to be of three kinds, viz vidyāsnātaka (or Veda-snātaka as Baud. gļ, pari. bhāṣā has it), vratasnātaka and vidyā-vratagnātaka (or veda vrata-snātaka as in Baud). One who has finished Veda study, but has not gone through the pratas ( described above ) is called vidyā-snātaka ; one who has finished the vratas, but has not finished his Veda study is styled vrata-snilalı ; while one who has finished both is named vidyd-vrata-snātaka. Yaj, I. 51 in saying that a student 'after finishing Veda (study) or the vratas ( observances of brabmacarya ) or both, and after giving to the teacher what the latter chooses to ask should take the ceremonial bath with the teacher's permission' impliedly refers to the three-fold division of snātakes. These three alternatives are due to the fact that & student may not have the ability or the time to go through the full Vedic curriculum and the

Gobbila ( III, 5. 23 ) says that of these, vidya-vrata-snātaka is the best, the other two being equal to each other. Āp. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 1-5 ) refers to this three-fold division and adds that all three are to be honoured as anātakas, but that great reward follows by honouring vidyd-vrata-snātakas. 

A good deal of time may conceivably elapse between a man's taking the ceremonial bath and actually marrying & woman. During that period he is called a snātaka; while after marriage he comes to be called a grhastha 977. As long as & person is not married after he takes the bath, he has to follow the observances prescribed for snātakas and gļhasthas so far as applicable to his position but not those of a student. Gaut. 878 (IX. 1-2) makes the position quite olear by prescribing the same rules of conduct for gphasthas and for snātakas. He also states (in III. 9) that whatever rules laid down for brahma carins are not opposed to the special rules for other āśramas are to be observed by all. The latter means that the special obser vances of a brahmacārl are not applioable to bim (such as avoiding honey and flesh, living on alms, offering fuel-sticks to fire), 

The most elaborate procedure of samāvartana is found in Hir. gr. I. 9-13, Baud, gr. paribhāṣā I. 14, Pār, gi, II. 6 and Gobbila gr. III. 4-5. A concise statement is given below from Āśv. gr. (III. 8 and 9). The student who is about to return home from his teacher should get ready (eleven) things, viz. a jewel (to be suspended round his neck), two earrings, & pair of gar ments, an umbrella, a pair of shoes, a staff, a wreath, (powder) for rubbing his body with, ointinant, eye-salve, & turban, ( all these ) being meant for the teacher and for himself. If he cannot afford to have these materials for both of them, then he

should prepare them only for the teacher. He should prooure & fuel-stick from the north-east side of a sacrificial tree (like palāsa ); the fuel-stick may be undried if he wishes for the enjoyment of food or for prosperity or for splendour; it may be dry if he wishes for spiritual lustre; or both dry (in part) and undried in the remaining part if he desires both. Having placed the fuel-stick on high (not on the ground ) and having made gifts of food and of a cow to brāhmaṇas, he should perform the actions prescribed in godāna ceremony (and not the obser vances like remaining silent). He should 979 alter the mantras (of godāna ) so that they refer to himself. (He should rub himself) with the powder of Ekaklitaka, 980 Having bathed himself in lukewarm water and having put on two garments which have not yet been washed (or used ) with the mantra "You two (Mitra and Varuṇa ) put on garments 981 with fat splendour' (Rg. I. 152.1); he should apply eye-salve to his eyes with the words 'thou art the lustre of stone, protect my eye.' He should fasten the two ear-rings with the words 'thou art the lustre of stone ; protect my ear.' After having smeared his two hands with ointment ( saffron paste &c.) a brāhmaṇa should first anoint his face with it (and then the limbs), a Rajanya his two arms first, a vaisya his belly first, & woman her private parts, persons, who maintain themselves by running, their thighs. With the words 'free from distress art thou, may I become free from distress' he should put on the wreath, but not such a wreath as would be called a mālā (garland ). If some call it mālā ( through ignorance of what to say ) he should cause them to speak of it as sraj (wreath ). He steps into the shoes with the words you two are the supports of the gods, protect me from all sides and with the

words 'heaven's covering art thou he takes the umbrella. He takes the bamboo staff with the words 'bamboo art thou, thou art the child of a tree, proteot me from all sides.' Having tied round his neck the jewelo88 with the hymn beginning with 'dyusyam °,984 and having arranged the turban ( on his head ) he should in a standing posture put a fuel-stiok (on the fire), and should say at that time * memory and reproach, knowledge, faith, wisdom as the fifth, what is sacrificed, what is given (&s gift), what is studied and what is done, truth, learning, observances. O Agni, the vow (of thee) together with Indra, with Prajāpati, with the Bages, with the gages that are ksatriyas, with the Fathers, with the kings among Fathers, with men and with the kings among men, with the glow, with the super-glow, with the after-glow, with the counter-glow, with gods and men, with Gandharvas and Apsarases, with wild and domestio snimals, the yow be longing to my own self, dwelling in my own self, that is my entire vow. O Agnil I shall on all sides become this vow, svāhā'. With the hymn 'mine, O Agni, be the glory' (Rg. X. 128. 1) he should put fuel-sticks on fire one for each verse. 984 He should stay for the night at a place where the people will do honour to him (by offering Madhuparka )'. Madhuparka will be dealt with under marriage. 

The Baud. gp. paribhāṣı says (I. 14. 1) that the samāvarlana rite for him who is only a vratasnātaka ( and has not studied the Veda ) is performed silently (i. e. without the mantras prescribed ). The other gļhya sūtras have a similar procedure in samāvartana, only the mantras sometimes differ and a few details are added. 

Narayana on Aśv.gr. I. 8. 16 says that the magi' is 'suvar pumaya (mado of gold). Ap. gr. 12. 8 speaks of mapin sauvarnam gopadhanam'(a golden bead with two precious stones on two sides ).

Procedure of Samāvarlana 

For example, San. gr. (IIL 1.2) makes the student sit on bull's hide. Par. gp. (II. 6) prescribes that eight jars full of water are to be placed on kusa grass and water therefrom is to be poured over the head and the body of the student with certain mantras, that he is to worship the rising sun, to par take of curds or sesame seeds, to cleanse his teeth with an udumbara twig, he sees himself in a mirror ( after adorning himself ). Both Par. and Gobhila (IIL. 4. 23 ) say that in this rite the girdle is taken off. Gobhila ( III. 4. 31-34 ) says that at the end of the rite the student should mount & chariot drawn by oxen, drive some distance in an eastern or northern direction, should then come back to the teacher who honours him with madhuparka, Hir. gr. (1. 9. 10) says that the girdle, the staff and the black antelope skin that he wore as brahma cirin are to be thrown into water. The Laghu-Ăśvalāyana smrti ( 14th section ) appears to suggest that godāna and sama Vartana take place on the same day and that at the end of the homa in samāvartana & student of the Rgveda should unloosen the girdle of muñja grass with the inantra 'ud uttamam mumugdbi' (Rg. I. 25,21). It is for this reason that in the Maratha country samāvartana is called 'sodmuñja' (rite in which the inučja girdle is taken away). 

The gūtras more or less prescribe expressly or impliedly the same materials that are required by Āśvaldyana. Vide Bhār, gr. II. 18 ( whioh enumerates them in one place ). Baud. gr. paribhāṣā sūtra I. 13. 1. 

Some of the sūtras specify the auspicious times when this rite is to be performed. Hir. g!. I. 9. 3 lays down that the proper time for snāna is during the northern course of the sun, in the bright half of a montb when the moon is in conjunction with Rohini, Mrgasiras, Tiṣya (Pugya ), Uttara Phalguni, Hasta, Citrā, or Visakha. The Baud. gr. paribhāṣā (L 13. 3-9) omits Mrgasiras out of these, while Bhar. gr. (II. 18 ) omits Rohiṇi and Mrgasiras and adds Svāti. Medieval and modern digests add elaborate rules about the astrological details for the proper day of samāvartana, which are passed over here. Vide Samskāraprakasa pp. 576-578 for some of these details. 

Numerous rules are laid down in the smrtis and digests about anatakas (@natakadharmaḥ). Many of these rules are applicable to grhasthas also (i. e. anatakas who have married ). Those rules are too numerous to enumerate. But some idea may be conveyed by quoting in full the rules in Asv. RI.

(III. 9. 6-7) which has the shortest treatment and adding a few interesting items from other works. Aśv. gr. (III. 9. 6–7) says 'He (the snātaka ) should not bathe at night, nor bathe naked, nor lie down naked, he should not look at a naked woman except during intercourse, ho shall not run when it rains, he should not climb up a tree, nor descond into a well, should not cross a river (by swimming) with his arms, he should not expose himself to a danger. A great being indeed is a snātaka--so it is known (from the śruti). Ap. Dh. S. (I. 11. 30. 6-1 11. 32. 29), Vas. XII. 1-47, Gaut. IX, Yaj. I. 129-166, Manu IV. 13ff, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 71, Pār. gr. II. 1 contain an exhaus tive treatment of snātaka vratas. Some of these are concerned with the rules about anadhyāyas, about answering calls of nature, about persons whose food should not be taken, about sexual intercourse, about acamana, about daily observances like the five mabāyajñas, about upākarma and utsarjana. These have been or will be dealt with in the appropriate places. A few of the other important rules of conduct are: a snataka should always be pure (in body), should daily bathe and should apply fragrant unguents (like sandal-wood paste) to his body, should be always patient, persistent in his under takings, self-restrained, generous and not disposed to cause injury to others (Gaut. 9.7 and 73 ); he should speak the truth and also speak what is agreeable, but should not tell disagree able truths, nor should he tell agreeable lies (Manu IV. 138 and Gaut. IX, 68 ); he should according to his ability try to make his day fruitful as regards the performance of meritorious acts, satisfaction of (legitimate ) desires and acquisition of wealth, but he should look upon dharma as the principal of the three puruṣārthas (Gaut. IX. 46-47, Manu 1V. 176, Yaj. I. 156 ), though he should avoid even what is allowed by the sās. tras if it is bateful to the people; he should not beg (for his liveli hood) of anybody except the king or bis pupils, but when oppres sed by hunger he may beg a little such as a cultivated or uncul tivated field, & cow, goats and sheep, or gold, corn, food (Vas. XII. 2-3, Gaut. IX, 63-64, Manu IV. 33-34, Yāj. I. 130); but he should not beg of a king who is not of ksatriya descent or who sets at naught the dictates of the sāstras (Manu IV. 84, 87) nor should he stay in the kingdom of a sūdra king (Manu IV. 61); he should not talk with the mlecchas, impure persons and irreligious persons (Gaut. IX. 17 ); he should not dwell in contact with sinners, cāndalas and other untouchables, with fools or persons puffed up with the pride of wealth &o. (Manu IV, 79); he should

not be restless in his sexual desires or with his hands and feet, speech and eyes ( Gaut, IX.50, Manu IV. 177, Vas. VI. 42 ); he should go round ( perform pradakṣiṇā ), when he meets on his way a cow, images of gode, a brāhmaṇa, ghee, honey, a square, well-known trees (Manu IV. 39, Gaut. IX. 66 ); he should not engage in wordy quarrels with his parents, guests, brothers, sisters, persons connected by marriage, maternal uncles, dependents, relations, sacrificial and family priests, children, wife, slaves (Manu IV. 179–180=śāntiparva 244, 14-16, Yāj. I. 157-158 ); he should carry a bamboo stick, a water jar, kuśa grass, wear two yajñopavitas, two garments (upper and lower) and two golden ear-rings (Manu IV. 36, Yaj. I. 133, Vas. XII. 14, 37-38); if he has inoney enough he should not wear old and dirty clothes, his garments should be white, be should not wear garments that are dyed and black oloth even when that is its natural colour (Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 30, 10-13, Manu IV. 34-35, Yāj. 1. 131, Gaut. IX. 4-5 ) nor should he wear the clothes, shoes, and garland of another and if he wears those of another owing to poverty, he should thoroughly clean them (Gaut. IX. 6-7, Manu IV.66); he should not allow his beard to grow unless there is some good ground to do so and should pare his nails (Gaut. IX. 8, Manu V. 95, Yaj. I. 131); while his shoes are in his band he should not sit on & seat nor should he salute a person or bow to a deity (Gaut. IX. 45 ); he should not blow with his mouth to kindle fire (Manu IV. 53, Vas. XII. 27, Gaut. IX. 32); he should not hold simultaneously in his hands fire and water nor should he come between the fire and a brābmaṇa nor between two brāhmaṇas without their permission (Ap. Dh.S. IL 5.12.6-8, Vas. XII. 28-30); he should not eat food in the same plate with his wife, nor should he see his wife while she is eating or applying eye-8alve or when she is yawning or sneezing (Manu IV.43-44, Vas. XII.31, Gaut. IX, 32); he should not use a seat or pādukas or tooth brush made of palasa ( Vas. XII. 34, Gaut. IX. 44, Ap. Dh. 8. I. 11.32. 9); he should wear a wreath (of flowers) and ointment so as not to be easily noticed ( Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 32.5, Manu IV, 72, Vas. 12. 39, Gaut.

IX. 20-22, Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 11-14); he should not inform a person when a cow does some damage or allows her calf to have milk without the owner knowing it (Ap. Dh. S. I. 11. 31. 9-10, Gaut. IX. 24-25 ); he should enter or leave his village from the east or north (Ap. Dh. $. I. 11. 30, 7) and should not enter a village or a guarded house by & by-path (Manu IV. 73, Yāj. I. 140, Ap. Db. $.

engage in dalliance with his wife, engage 987 in yoga practices in a place screened from public view and he should guard his speech, intellect and strength and should keep his wealth and age very secret; but he should make public the repayment of a debt, a gift, mortgage or sale, the gift of his daughter in marriage, the letting loose of a bull (in sraddha ) and a sin done in secret. 

Manu (XI. 203 ) says that the prāya citta for not observing the rules of conduct laid down for enātakas is fasting for a day. Haradatta on Gautama IX. % says that the rules for snātakas are meant for brahmaṇa and kṣatriya snātakas only, that the prāyaścitta for non-observance is also to be undergone by them and that the vaisya snātakas are not obliged to observe these rules. 

In modern times samāvarta na often takes place & short time after upadayana and sometimes on the 4th day thereafter or even the next day. As many brābmanas do not learn any part of the Veda, samāyartana has become a mere matter of form in their case. Even the Samskārakaustubba (p. 607) presoribes a very brief procedure for samāvartana when the brahmacāri is ill. It consists in the brahmacārl giving up his girdle &o., in shaving the boy silently, in silently bathing at a holy place, putting on anotber garment, then sipping water twice, bringing fire from the house of a śrotriya and plaoing it on some place according to the rules, then contemplating on Prajāpati and putting the samidh (fuel-stick) on fire. 

As a brahmacārl is not affected by the mourning due to the death of relatives (except his parents), on samāvartana he has to observe impurity for three days (if there have been deaths of relatives in the interval, but not for births ). (Vide Manu V. 88=Viṣṇu Dh. S. 22. 87).
