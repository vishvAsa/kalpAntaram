CHAPTER IX 

MARRIAGE 

This is the most inportant of all samskāres. Throughout the ages for which literary tradition is available in India marriage has been highly thought of. The several words that are employed to denote the idea of marriage indicate one or more of the elements of the samskāra of marriage. Such words are udvāha ( taking the girl out of her parental home ), vivāha ( taking the girl away in a special way or for a special purpose i. e. for making her one's wife ), pariṇaya or pariṇayana (going round i. e. making a pradakṣiṇā to fire), upayama (to bring near and make one's own), and panigrahana ( taking the hand of the girl). Though these words express only one component element of the rite of marriage they are all used in the sāstras 1018 to indicate the totality of the several acts that go to make up the ceremony of marriage. The word 'vivāha occurs in the Tai. S. VII. %. 87 and Alt. Br. (27.5). In the Tāṇdya 1013 Mahābrābmaṇa VII. 10.1 it is said that "heaven and earth were once together but they became separate '; then they said let us bring about a marriage, let there be a co-ope ration between us'." 

Before dwelling upon the various aspects of marriage, the question, whether our authorities point to & state of society when there was no institution of marriage, but there was only promisouity, requires to be considered. The Vedic works con tain no indications about a society in which the relations of the sexes were promiscuous and unregulated. In the Mabā. bhārata, 1014 however, Pāṇdu is made to state to his queen Kunti that women in former ages were under no control, indulged themselves as they liked and that they left off one man and

went after another, that this state of things continued to his (Pāṇdu's ) day in the country of Uttara Kuru, that it was Śretaketu, son of Uddālaka, who for the first time stopped all this license and laid down the rule that if a woman proved false to her husband or if a husband was false to a chaste wife, very grave sin would be incurred. In the Sabhāparva (31. 37-38 ) it is said that through the favour of Agni women in Mābiṇmati did what they liked and could not be restrained. These passages cannot be relied upon for proving promisouity of intercourse. In the first place, the country of Uttara Kuru is more or less inythical. This passage rather gives expression to what the poet imagined about remotest ages and not what he knew was the real state of society thousands of years before him. The theory of an original state of promiscuity onoe advanced by Reveral sociologists has now ceased to be respectable (vide Mrs. M. Cole in 'Marriage, past and present'p. 10. 

The purpose of marriage, even according to the Rgveda, was to enable a man, by becoming a householder, to perform sacrifices to the gods and to procreate song. The verse in Rg. X. 85. 36 shows that the husband took a woman as a wife for 'gārbapatya'. Rg. V. 3. %., V. 28. 3 speak of the co-operation of husband and wife in the worship of gods. Rg. III. 53, 4 contains the emphatic assertion the wife herself is the home' (jāyed-astam). In later literature also the same statement occurs. A wife was called "jāya ', because the husband was born in the wife as a son (Ait. Br. 33. 1). The Sat. Br. V. 2. 1. 10 says 'the wife ons is indeed half of one's self; therefore as long as a man does not secure a wife so long he does not beget a son and so he is till then not complete (or whole); but when he secures a wife he gets progeny and then he becomes complete'. Tho Ait. Ār. (I. 2. 4 ) says therefore a man, after securing a wife, regards himself as more complete'. When Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 12 forbids taking a second wife if the first is endowed with progeny and the performance of religious rites, it indicates

that the main purposes of marriage are two, 1014 vie. the wife enables a man to perform religious rites and is the mother of a son or sons who were supposed to save & man from hell. Manu (IX. 28 ) states that on the wife depend the procreation of sons, the performance of religious rites, service, highest pleasure, heaven for oneself and for one's ancestors. So these three viz, dharnasampatti, prajā (and consequent freedom from falling into hell ) and ruti (sexual and other pleasures) are the principal purposes of marriage according to the smrtis and niba ndbas. Yāj. I. 78 is to the same effect. Jaimini (VI. 1. 17 ff) establishes that husband and wife hare to perform saorifices together and not separately and Āp. Dh, S.0II. 6. 13. 16-17 emphatically says that there can be no separation between husband and wife, for since marriage they have to perform religious acts jointly. 

Marriage is a composite rite comprising several subordinate elements which have to be done in a certain order and the last of which is seeing the constellation of the seven sages; it (rite ) brings about the status of a woman as a person's wife.1018 

The first consideration is : how to choose a bridegroom and what qualifications make a person a very desirable bridegroom, Agy. gṛ. (1. 5. 2) says 'one should give & maiden '18 (in marriage ) to a man endowed with intelligence'. The Āp. gr. (3.20 ) remarks "the accomplishments of & bridegroom are that he must be endowed with good family, a good character, auspicious characteristics, learning and good health". Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1.12 states 'a maiden should be given in marriage to one who is endowed with good qualities and who is a colibate (till then)'. Even the Sakuntala (IV) echoes the words of

(Oh. IX 

Baudhāyana 'the best idea is to give one's daughter to a man endowed with good qualities'. Yanna quoted in the Sm. C.(I. p. 78) says 'one should seek for seven qualities in a bridegroom viz. good family, good character, bodily appearance, fame, learning, wealth and support (of relatives and friends ); the other matters need not be considered'. Bphat-parāśara (p. 118 Jiv. ed.) enumerates eight qualities in a bridegroom viz. oaste, learning, youth, strength, health, support of many (friends &o.), ambi. tions ( arthitva ), and possession of wealth. Aśv.gr. (1. 5. 1) and others place kula (a good family ) in the forefront in the case of both the bride and the bridegroom. 1080 'One should first examine the family ( of the intended bride or bridegroom ) as it has been said above (in the Asv. Srauta gūtra IX. 3).' The Āsv. Srauta reads 'those who on their mother's as well as their father's side through ten generations are endowed with learning, austerity and meritorious works or whose pure brāhmaṇa lineage can be traced on both sides (for ten gonera. tions) or according to some on the father's side.' Manu regarded a good family as the most important from the eugenic point of view. In IV. 244 he says 'one who desires to raise his family to excellence and eminence should always enter into marriage alliances with the best and avoid alliance with the low'; and adds (III. 6-7) that ten kinds of families even though richly endowed with cattle, wealth &o, should be avoided in marriage viz, in which the samskāras are not performed, in which there is no malo progeny, which are devoid of Veda (study), which have hairy members, that suffer from piles or consumption or indigestion or epilepsy, white or black leprosy. Manu ( III. 63-65 ) explains under what circumstances good families are reduced to a bad state. Hārita states that the offspring is in accordance with the (qualities of the) family of the parents. The Hargacarita ( IV) gives expression to the view that generally the wise look to good family first even though there may be other qualities in the bridegroom. Manu II. 238, however, allows a man to marry a girl even from an inferior or bad family provided she is & jewel among women.

Marriage and good family

Yāj. (I. 54-55 ) emphasizes the importance of a good family famed for ton generations and freedom from diseases that are hereditarily transmitted and adds that the bride groom must be young, intelligent, & favourite among the people and his virility must be carefully tested. The Mit. on Yaj. 1. 55 quotes Nārada (stripumsa ) who mentions some characteristics of the virile man and enumerates fourteen varieties of impotent persons ( verses 11-13). Katyāyana 1081 mentions what defective bridegrooms are to be avoided viz. the lunatic, one guilty of grave sins, leprous, impotent, one of the same gotra, one bereft of eyesight or hearing, an epileptio and adds that these defects are to be avoided even among brides. The Mahābhārata observes 'friendship and marriage should take place between those alone whose wealth is similar and whose learning (i, e. the learning in whose fami lies) is of equal status, not between opulent (well-off) and the poverty-stricken'. 1028 

Though Manu and Yāj. indicate that impotent persons are not eligible for marriage, yet such persons 'rarely married. Their marriages were held valid by Manu, Yāj. 'and others and their sons (by niyoga) took property as if they were aurasa sons. Vide Manu IX. 203 and Yāj. II. 141-142. 

The Saṁskāraprakāśa (pp. 752-754 ) contains a long dis cussion on the question how from bodily characteristics one can find whether a man will live long or what bis prospects would be. These are passed over for want of space. 

Rules for the selection of the bride are far more elaborate than those for selecting a bridegroom, though in some respects they are the same (such as about the necessity of good family, about the absence of diseases &o.).

gives expression to the then view that broad hips and slender waists make women attractive, Āýv. gr. I. 5. 3 says 1034 'one should marry a girl who is endowed with intelligence, beauty, a good character and auspicious characteristios and who is healthy'. Sān. gr. I. 5. 6 and Manu III. 4 and Yāj. I. 52 also require that the girl should be possessed of auspicious charac teristios (or indications). These (lakṣanas) are of two kinds, bāhya ( visible or bodily characteristics ) and ābbyantara (invisible). Āp. gr. 1025 (III. 21 ) states a commonsense rule: 'a girl on whom his mind and eyes are riveted will bring him happiness (or prosperity ), he should pay no heed to other things; this is the view of some'. The Kāmasutra quotes the view of Ghotakamukha 'he should proceed to marry a girl on taking whom as his wife he would regard himself as blessed and would not be blamed by his friends (or persons in a similar station in life ) 1026 Manu III. 8 and 10, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 24. 12-16 say that one should not marry a girl having tawny hair or having an excessive limb (such as a sixth finger) or a deficient limb, who is bairless or very hairy, who is talkative and has yellowish eyes; but should marry a girl who has limbs void of any defect, whoso gait is like that of a swan or an elephant, the hair on whose head or body is of slight growth and whose teeth are small, whose body is delicate. The Viṣṇu-purāṇa ( III. 10. 18-22 ) adds that the girl must not have a marked growth of hair on her chin or lip, her voice must not be hoarse or like that of a crow; her legs and ankles must not be very hairy, there should be no dimples on her cheeks when she laughs, she should not be very dwarfish or very tall &c. Manu III. 9 and Ap. gp. (III. 13 ) say that the girl to be married must not bear names of the lunar mansions ( such as Revati, Ārdrā &c.), trees or rivers, she must not bear a mleccha name or that

of a mountain, of a bird, of a snake or of a slave or a name that is terrifio. Ap. gr. (III. 14 ) and Kamasūtra III, 1. 13 mention that a girl should not be chosen, the penultimate letter of whose name is r or I (such as Gaurl, sāli, Kamalū). Nārada 1087 ( strl pumseyoga 36 ) says that defects of girls are as follows:when they suffer from long-standing or disgusting diseases, when they are devoid of a limb or have already had connection with an other man, when they are wicked or have their minds fixed on another; and Ap. gr. (III. 11-12 ) states other defects of girls viz, one should not choose a girl who is asleep or weeps or has left the house when persons come to see whether she can be chosen. Vide Mārkandeya-purana 34. 76-77 for guṇas and defects of girls as 'brides'. 

Bhār.gf. I. 11 says that there are four inducing reasons 148 for marrying a particular girl viz. wealth, beauty, intelligence and family. If all four cannot be secured, wealth may be neglected (as the least important of all ); then beauty may be neglected if there is intelligence and good family, but there is a difference of view as to the latter two, some preforring intelligence to family and others family to intelligence. Mānava gf. (I. 7.6–7) adds a fifth inducement for marriage, viz. vidya (learning) after beauty and before prajñā. Vide also Vārāha gf. 10. 

Some of the gļhyasūtras propose a peculiar mystical method of selecting a bride. The Asv. gr. (1. 5. 3) after stating that one should select a girl endowed with good characteristics (lakṣaṇas ) proceeds 'lakṣaṇas are very difficult to discern and therefore prescribes (I. 5.5-6) that eight lumps of different kinds of earth should be taken respectively from a field that yields two crops a year, from a cow-stable, from a vedl ( sacrifi cial altar, after sacrifice is performed), from a pool of water that does not dry up, from a gambling place, from a place where four roads meet, from a barren 'spot, and from & burial ground; then he should recite over the lumps the formula' fla (right) has been born first in the beginning; truth is founded ( or fixed) in fta; may this girl attain here that for which she is born; may what is true be visible;' then he says to the girl

take one of these'. According as she chooses the lump, it may respectively be deemed that she will have offspring rich in food (if she chooses the lump of the earth taken from the field of two crops a year &c. ), or rich in cattle, or rich in spiritual lustre or rich in everything, or addicted to gambling, or wandering in different directions or poor, or that she will bring death to her husband ( if she takes the lump of the earth from the burial ground). The Gobhila gr. II. 1. 4-9 speaks of these lumps and adds that a ninth lump may be formed by mixing up the earths of all eight varieties and that if she takes up any one of the four lumps of earth from an altar, furrow, a pool or a cow-stable or (according to some ) the ninth lump, she may be selected. The Laugākṣi gr. 14. 4-7 contains the same rules as in Gobhila. Āp. gr. 1048 (III. 15-18) prescribes a somewhat different method. If both sides agree, the bridegroom (or his friends) should place in one lump of earth several kinds of seeds (such as rice, barley &o.); he should take (a lump having in it) the dust from an altar, & third having a clod from & ploughed field, a lump having cowdung inside and (a fifth having) a clod of earth from a cemetery and keep ing them before the girl ask her to touch one of them (the five ). If she touches any one of the first four, that is an indication of future prosperity (of the nature of the object touched ), but the last ( viz. clod of earth from cemetery ) is objectionable. The Vārāba gr. 10 and Bhār, gr. I. 11 speak of only four lumps of earth viz. from a field, from an altar, from a cow-stable, and from a cemetery and say that one should not marry a girl who takes up the lump of cemetery earth. Mānava gf. (1. 7. 9-10) speaks of eight lumps but substitutes & lump of earth where dūrvā grows and a lump from under a tree filled with fruit for earth from a pool of water and one from & gambling place and adds that the eight lumps should be placed in a temple and if the girl takes up the lump from a cemetery or from a barren spot or from where four roads meet she should not be married. Many digests like the Gr. R. (pp. 13-22) contain long quotations which dilate upon the indications about the auspiciousness or otherwise of girls from their several physi. cal features. 

Gaut. IV. 1, Vas. 8. 1, Mānava gr. I. 7.8, Yaj. I. 52 and Beveral others say that the girl must be younger ( yaviyasi )

than the bridegroom and the Kāmagūtra ( III. 1. 2) recommends that she must be younger than the bridegroom by at least three years. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 52 explains 'yavlyasi' as meaning 'younger in age and smaller in stature' (than the bridegroom). What the age of marriage was will be discussed a little below. 

Gaut. IV. 1, 1030 Vag. 8, 1, Yāj. I. 52, Manu (III. 4 and 12) and others say that one should marry only & girl who is a virgin and of the same caste. How far widow-marriages and intercaste marriages were allowed would be discussed later on. 

The Manava gr. 1.7.8, Manu III. 11 and Yāj. I. 53 require that the girl to be chosen must not be brotherless. This requirement which has been not in force for centuries has a long history behind it. In Rg. I. 124, 7 it is said 1031 'as a brotherless maiden compos back towards her male relations (ber father's family)...80 the dawn reveals objects (or ber beauty ).' In the Atharvaveda I. 17.1 wo read 'like brotherless women let thom sit still with their splendour gone. Both these passages are quoted and explained in the Nirukta III. 4-5. In ancient times when a man had no son, he could make his daughter do for a son (i. e. she herself became putrikā) and stipulate with the person marrying her that the son born of hor would be his ( i. e, the girl's father's ) son and would offor piṇdas as & son to his maternal grandfather. The result would be that the son of such a girl would not offer pindas to his father and would not continue the line of his father. Rg. III. 31. 1 (a very obscure and difficult verse ) has been explained by the Nirukta ( 111.4) as referring to the practice of declaring a daughter to be one's son 1038. Therefore, brotherless maidens were not chosen as brides and the Rg. speaks of spinsters growing old in their parental home ( Rg. II. 17, 7). Vas. Dh. S. 17. 16 refers 1033 to

Rg. I. 124, 7 and quotes & verse about & brotherless girl. Such & daughter at whose marriage the father made the stipulation stated above was called putrikā and according to Gaut. 28. 17 some 1034 teachers went so far as to say that a daughter became a putrikā by the mental resolve of the father alone ( without there being an express agreement with the bridegroom ). It is therefore that Manu (3. 11 ) ordains that one should not marry a girl that has no brother, as there is the danger of her being & putrikā, The Nirukta (III. 5) quotes another 1038 Vedic passage *one should not marry & brotherless woman, for she becomes the son of him (her father)' and remarks that in this passage there is a direct prohibition against marrying & brotherless maiden ( while in the passage of the Atharva veda it is indirect, being involved in a simile) and it is also expressly said that she becomes the son of her father. In medieval times this prohibi tion against marrying a brotherless girl gradually was ignored and in modern times the pendulum has swung the other way, a brotherless girl being & coveted prize if her father be rich. In course of time popular feeling changed and no girl could remain unmarried if she wanted heavenly worlds. There is an interesting story in the Salyaparva chap. 52 of the daughter of Kuñigarga who, when told by Nārada that an unmarried womon could not secure heaven, married for one day Sșogavat and then went to heaven. 

There are further restrictions about choosing & girl for marriage. The rule was that a man should marry a girl of the same caste. So far there is what is called endogamy (i. e, rule requiring marriage within a certain large community ). But within this large community there were certain groups which were prohibited for marriage to a person belonging to another group of the same caste or community ( i. e. the principle of exogamy operated within the large community itself). The Hir. gr. I. 19. %, Gobhila gr. III. 4. 4, Ap. Dl. 8. II. 5. 11. 15 require that the bride to be chosen must not belong to the same gotra as that of the bridegroom. They are all silent about the sameness of prarara. Gaut. IV. %., Vas. Dh. S. VIII. 1, Mānava

87. I. 7.8, Vāraba gr. 9, Saṅkha 1036 Dh. 8. forbid marriage with a girl whose pravara ( or ārṣeya ) is the same as that of the bridegroom; but they say nothing about the prohibition against the sameness of gotra.

II. 5, 11, 16 require that the bride must not be a sapinda or blood relation of the mother of the bridegroom; while Gaut. IV. 2, Vas. VIII. 2, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 24. 10, Vārāha gr. 9, Saṅkha Dh. ( quoted above ), Yāj. I. 53 and others restrict the prohibi tion against marrying a sapiṇda girl to seven degrees on the father's side and five degrees on the mother's side. There were others like the Vedavyāsa-smrti which not only prohibited marriage with a girl who had the same gotra as the bride groom's, but prohibited marriage with a girl whose mother's gotra was the same as the bridegroom's. 

All these prohibitions against marrying a sagotra, sapravara or sapinga girl are extremely important, as the following considerations will show. It is a canon of the Pūrvamināmsā that if there is a seen ( dṛṣta ) or easily perceptible reason for a rule stated in the sacred texts, it is only recommendatory and a breach of such a rule does not nullify the prinoipal act. But if there is an unseen (adrsta ) reason for a rule and there is & breach of such rule, the principal act itself is rendered invalid and nugatory thereby. The rule about not marrying & woman who is disessed or who has superfluous or deficient limbs has a seen reason viz, marriage with such a girl causes unhappiness ( if she is diseased) or comment ( if she has defi cient limbs). Therefore, if a person marries such a girl the marriage is perfectly valid. But there is no seen or easily perceptible reason for the prohibition against marrying & sagotra or sapravara girl. Therefore, such rules go to the root of the matter and are obligatory and, if there is a breach of them, the marriage is no marriage, it is null and void. So even if a person goes through a ceremony of marriage with a girl who

is & sagotra or sapravara or sapiṇda ( within prohibited degrees) she does not in law become his wife at all. Those principles are very luoidly set 1087 forth by Medhātithi on Manu III. 11, by the Mit, on Yāj. I. 53, the Madanaparijata and other works. Therefore, these questions of sagotra, sapravara and sapiṇda will be dealt with at some length later on. 

The question of the age of marriage for men and women will now be considered. This is a very interesting and instruotive study. The age of marriage for both sexos has varied consider ably from age to age, from province to province and also from caste to caste even at the same time. 1038 As regards men there is po special rule as to the age before which & man was obliged to marry. A man could remain celibate all his life, while at least in medieval and modern times marriage has been abso lutely necessary for evory girl. A man was to marry after he had finished his Vedic studies; but the period of Vedic study was fluctuating (i. e. it could be 12, 24, 36, 48 years or as much time as was necessary to master one Veda or a portion of it). Usually twelve years were devoted to brahmacarya in ancient times and as upanayana ordinarily took place in the 8th year (for brāhmaṇas) a man would ordinarily be 20 years old or more at the time of marriage. It is therefore that Manu (IX. 94) romarks that a man of thirty may marry a girl of twelve years or a man of 24 who is in a hurry to become a house holder may marry a girl of eight. Basing on this the Viṣṇu purāṇa 1039 (III. 10. 16 ) says that the ages of the bride and bridegroom should be in the ratio of 1 to 3. Angiras says that the bride should be two, three, five or more years younger. In

Age of Marriage for girls

the Mahabharata 1040 Gautama is prepared to give his daughter in marriage to Uttanka if he could be a youth of 16 years. In another place the Mahabharata (Sabha 64. 14 and Vanaparva 5. 15 ) uses the simile of & maiden not liking a husband of 60 years. That shows that girls were sometimes married to even old men of 60 in those days as rarely in modern times also. In the Mahabhārata (Anusāsana 44. 14) the respective ages of the bridegroom and bride are recommended as 30 and 10 or 21 and 7; while the Udvāhatattva (p. 123) and S. Pr. p. 766 quote & verge from the Mahabharata that a man of 30 should marry a girl of 16 (but from the metre and context it appears that 

sodaṣa-varṣam' as printed should be dasa-varsām). 

In the Rgveda there are no clear statements about the exact age when girls were married. But there are indications that many girls were married at a sufficiently matureage (at least they were not married at the tender age of eight). We have already Been (p. 435 ) that brotherless girls often remained unmarried till old age. One of the benevolent deeds 1041 of the Asvins is that they bestowed a husband on Ghoṣā who was growing old in her father's house. Vide algo Rg. I. 124.7, II. 17. 7, and Atharve. veda I. 17. 1. In Rg. X. 27. 12 it is said' when a bride is fine looking and well adorned, she by herself seeks her friend from among men. That shows that girls were grown-up enough to select their husbands. Some of the verges in the marriage hymn (such as Rs. X, 85.26-27, 46 ) indicate 1018 that married girls could not have been child-wives, but must have been grown-up. On the other hand in Rg. I. 116. 1 it is said that the Nāsatyas (Asvins ) bestowed a wife on Vimada who was an arbhaga ( of tender age ). 1048 But all that is meant seems to be that Vimada was a mere boy as compared with his rival kings who had come as suitors. The two vorges Rg. I. 126. 6-7 ( which are ratber too naive ) indicate that girls were married before they had attained puberty. In Rg. I. 51. 13 Indra is said to have given to old Kaksivat a wife named Vṛcaya who is styled 

arbhā'(young). But that word is only used in contradistino tion to the word 'mahate' (grown old ) applied to Kaksivat

and conveys no idea of her exact age. 1044 On the whole one may conclude that in the period of the Rgveda girls were probably married at any age ( either before puberty or aftor puberty ) and sometimes remained spinsters all their life. The other Samhitas and the Brāhmaṇas do not shed much light on the question of the age of marriago for girls. In the Chān. Up. Uṣasti Cakrāyana is described as dwelling in the Kuru country with his wife, who is said to have been 'ātikı' which Samkara explains as a mere undeveloped girl : 1045 

Coming to the ancient gshya and dharma sūtras, it will be Been from several considerations that girls were married just before the time of puberty or immediately after it. Among the several requirements of the bride to be chosen several gphys sūtras lay down that she must be s 'nagnikā'. Vide Hir. gr. I. 19. 2, Gobhila gr. III. 4. 6, Mānava gr. I. 7. 8, Vaik. VI. 12.1046 The word nagnika is variously explained by the commentators, Mātṇdatta on Hir, gr, explains that nagnikā means' one whose menstrual period is near' i. e, one who is fit for intercourse, Aṣṭā vakra, the commentator of the Mānava gr., explains nagnikā as 'one who has not yet experienced the impulses and emotions of youth' or 'one who looks pretty even without clothes' (taking the word along with greṣtham' that follows). The Grbyāsamgraha 1047 ( wbich is much later than the Gobhila gr.) explains' nagnika' as one who has not yet reached puberty. These varying explanations of the word 'nagnikā' are due to the fact that when some smftis and commentators wrote child marriages were not in vogue, while they were in vogue when and where others flourished. Vas, Dh, S. 17. 70 says 'the father

should give away his daugbter while she is still nagnikā through fear of her attaining puberty ( wbile unmarried ).' This shows that, according to Vas, nagnikā must have been & girl of tender years or one that had not attained puberty. 

There is another very important indication. Most of the grbyasūtras prescribe that the married couple should be celibate for at least three nights after marriage ( if not for a longer period ). For example, the Pār. gr. (1. 8 ) says1048 the married pair should (after marriage) not partake of kṣāra and lavana for three nights, should sleep on the ground ( end not on & cot, for the same period ) and should not have intercourse for a year, twelve nights, six nights, three nights in the last resort'. Vide for a similar rule Āśv. gr. I. 8. 10, Ap. gr. 8. 8-9, Sān. gr. I. 17. 5, Mānava gf. I. 14. 14, Kāthaka gr. 30. 1, Khādira gr. I. 4. 9 and others. Such an injunction against intercourse for three nigbts after marriage would have been uncalled for and extremely inappropriate if girls had been usually married when they were only eight to ten years old. Such injunctions by so many authors presuppose that girls must have generally been very near puberty or past puberty at the time of marriage. Haradatta who belongs to about the 12th century A. D. expressly says 1049 that (in his days ) in certain countries intercourse was commenced immediately after marriage and that such & usage being opposed to Aśv. gr. I. 8. 10 should not be followed ( but continence should be observed at least for three days after marriage). This shows that so late as 1200 A. D. in several countries the marriageable age of girls must have been at least about 14. 

In most of the grhyasūtras there is & rite called 'oaturthi. karma' (rite on 4th day after marriage). Vide Gobbila II. 5, Śān. gr. I. 18-19, Kbadira gf. I. 4. 12-16, Pār. gr. I. 11, Ap. gp 8. 10-11, Hir. gr. I. 23-24 &o. This rite has been described above (pp. 203-204) and corresponds to the garbhādhāna of later writers (e. g. Yāj. I. 11). As cohabitation is expressly mentioned in connection with this rite performed on the fourth day after

marriage it follows that girls must have generally been quite grown-up at the time of marriage. 

In some of the gļhyasūtras and smṛtis a slight prāgascitta (purificatory ceremony) is prescribed if the bride has menstrua tion during the progress of the marriage ceremonies. Vide Baud. gr. IV. 1. 10, Kausika sūtra 79. 16, Vaik. VI. 13, Atri ( ed. by Jiv. part I. p. 11 ). 

Gaut. 1050 (18. 20-23) says 's girl should be given in marriage before she attains the age of puberty. He who begleots it commits sin. Some declare that she should be given in marriage before she begins to wear clothes. A marria geable girl (who is not given in marriage by her father &c.) should allow tbree monthly periods to pass and after wards unite herself to a blameless man of her own will and give up the ornaments received from her father (or her family)'. This passage establishes that even before Gautama (i. e. 500 or 600 B. C.) there were people who advocated marriages of infant girls that did not care to put on clothes (i. e. who had no sense of shame if they went about without clothes ), that Gautama disapproved of this view, that he only presoribed that the marriage of girls should take place before puberty and he was not horrified if girls got themselves married sometime after puberty. But it is clear that no blame attached to the girl married after puberty or to the husband; the idea, however, had arisen even then that the father or guardian incurred blame or sin by not getting a girl married before puberty. Manu (IX. 89-90) goes so far as to say "A maiden may rather stay in her father's house oven till her death, though she may have attained puberty ; but the father should never give ber to one who is devoid of good qualities. A maiden after attaining puberty may wait for three years ( to see if she is given away by her father or brother &o.) but after this period she should seek a husband who is similar to her.' Anugāganaparve 44. 16 is to the same effect. Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 14 and Vas. V. Dh. S. 17. 67-68 give the same rule as in Manu IX. 90. But both add ( Vas. 17,70-71 and Baud. Dh. S. IV.1.12) that the father or guardian inours the sin of destroying an embryo at each appearance of menses as long as the girl is

Early Marriage for girls 

unmarried. Yaj I. 64 and Nārada (stripumga, verses 25-27) state the same rule. 

On account of this change in popular beliefs and senti: ments it came to be recommended that a girl must be married early and may be given even to one 1051 who is devoid of qualities (in spite of Manu IX 89 ). Vide Baud. Db, S. IV, 1.12 and 15. 

So we see that from about 600 B, C. to about the beginning of the Christian Ere it did not matter at all if a girl was married a few months or few years after puberty. But by about 200 A. D. (when the Yaj. smrti was composed) popular feeling had become insistent on pre-puberty marriages. The reasons for this change are not quite clear. But it is possible to hold that it was due to the following circumstances. Buddhism bad spread far and wide during these centuries with its encouragement of the institution of monks and nuns. There was laxity of morals among nuns. A further reason may be adduced viz. that girls had generally ceased to study anything, though some of them certainly did study in the times of Pāṇini and Patañjali, and so society did not like girls to remain doing nothing. From the times of the Rgveda (X. 85. 40-41) there was a mystical belief that Soma, Gandharva and Agni were the divine guardians of a girl and the Gphyāgamgraha (quoted in the oom. on Gobhila gļ. III. 4.6 ) says that Soma enjoys a girl first, then Gandharva enjoys her when her breasts develop and fire wben sbe men truates. Therefore, a feeling arose that a girl must be married even before she develops any distinct signs of femininity. Samvarta 1053 (verses 64 and 67) gives expression to this idea, Further, since marriage came to be looked upon as the upanayana in the case of women, naturally the age for upanayana (5th year) came to be looked upon as the proper age for marriage. Vide Samskārakaustubha quoted below. It came to be believed that there was no hope of heaven for a woman who died unmarried.

[ Ch. 

In the Salyaparva 1098 chap. 52 we have the story of a girl, daughter of Kuṇi Garga, who practised severe penanoe till she reached old age and yet was told by Nārada that if she died uomarried she would not go to heaven. The woman induced Sṭngavat of the Galava family for a day previous to her death to marry her by the promise of giving him half of her merit (puṇya). The Vaik. 1084 (V. 9), while describing the ceremony of funeral rites in cases of distress, mentions the curious practice of find. ing out a male of the same caste for a girl, who dies unmarried though of the age of puberty, with whom a sort of marriage is gone through and the girl is then cremated. Whatever the reasons may be, this tendency to bring down the age of marriage for girls was accentuated in the first five or six centuries of the Christian era. The Laugākṣi1055 gr. ( 19. 2 ) says 'brabmacarya for girls lasts till the 10th or 12th year'. The Vaik. (VI. 12 ) says that a brāhmaṇa should marry a brāhmaṇa girl who is a nagnikā or gauri and defines nagnikā as a girl over eight years but less than ten and gauri as one who is between ten and twelve and has not bad menstruation, Aparārka (p. 85 ) quotes the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa to the effect that nagnikā is one who is ten years old. Vide Sm. O. quoting Samgraha. Parāśara, Yāj. and Sarvarta go even beyond this. Parāśara 1058 ( VII. 6-9) Baya' a girl of eight is called gaurl, but one who is nine years old is a rohini; one who is ten years old is a kanya; beyond this (1. e, after 10 years ) she is a rajasvalā. If a person does not give away a maiden when she has reached her 12th year, bis pitfs have to drink every month her menstrual discharge. The parents and also the eldest brother go to hell on seeing (an unmarried ) girl reaching the state of a rajasvala'. Parāśars adds that the brāhmaṇa who marries such a girl should not be spoken to or admitted to dinner in the same row (as other

brāhmaṇas) and that he becomes the husband of a prsall. On the other hand the Vāyupurāṇa ( 83. 44 ) extols the marriage of & gauri by remarking that her son purifies 21 ancestors on bis father's side and 6 male ancestors on bis mother's side. Samvarta ( verse 65-66) bas the same two verses as Parāśara (VII. 6 and 8) and winds up (verse 67) by saying that the marriage of a girl of eight is highly commended. The saine four verses (Parābara VII. 6-9) occur in Bșhad-Yama ( Anan. ed. ) chap. 3. 19-22, but the order is different. Angiras (vv. 126-128, Ānan. ed.) has the same verses. Kaśyapa as quoted in the Gr. R. (p. 46 ) says that & girl is called gauri when she is seven, a kanyakā when she is ten and kumārt when she is twelve. It will be noticed that the smṛtis of Vaikhānasa and Kaśyapa differed from Parāśara as to the definition of gauri. Further the three smstis make marriage of a girl after puberty an extremely sinful act and condemn not only the parents but also the husband, while Baud. prescribed only a slight prāyasoitta for the father alone even if there was menstruation during the marriage rites. Marloi105? (quoted in Pār. M. I. 2. p. 177) said that choosing a bride who was five years old was best. Even Manu ( 9.88 ) recommended an early marriage if a very desirable bridegroom was available. Rama and Sitā are said to have been respective. ly 13 and 6 at the time of marriage (Arapyakāṇda 47, 10-11). But this passage appears to be an interpolation. In the Balakāṇda 1058 it is expressly stated that Sita and her sisters enjoyed in private dalliance with their respective busbands immediately after marriage. If this is true then Sitā could not have been only 6 at the time of marriage. 

The rule that brāhmana girls were to be married between 8 to 10 years became general from about the 6th or 7th century and continued down to modern times. During the last two or three decades the marriageable age of girls owing to several causes, particularly the ravages of plague and the economio condition of the middle cladres, has risen very high and marriages of girls even of poor brābmanas hardly ever take place before 16 and have to be postponed to the age of 20 and beyond. Besides the Child Marriage Restraint Act (XIX of 1929, as amended

by Act 19 of 1938) has fixed the minimum age limit for girls at 14 and persons getting their daughters married before the completion of 14 years are liable to be punished in a criminal court under the Act. There is no reason to laugh at ancient Indian writers for the low age of marriage they advocated. Child marriages were common in all countries of Europe. Even in England the age limits for boys and girls were recognised by the law only at 14 and 1% respectively until 1929, when the lowest marriageable age for both was fixed at 16 (19 and 20 Geo, V. Chap. 36). Besides it must be remembered that when marriages of girls of tender years took place they were purely a sacrament. There was no question of consummation which took place only after puberty. Sages condemned intercourse even with one's wife before she attained puberty. 1058 Winternitz in * Die Frau,' p. 135 refers to a work of F. J. Furnivall on Child Marriages, Divorces &c' between 1560-66 A. D. in England from which it is clear that marriages of children of 9 or 10(and rarely of even 2 or 3 years) took place in England only about 300 years ago. 

These rules about the proper age for the marriage of girls affected only brābmaṇas. Sanskrit poets and dramatists always depict that the heroines in their works are grown-up at the time of marriage and even Bhavabhūti imagines that Malati, the heroine of his romantic drama of Malatimādhava, was so grown-up that it was practically a case of love at first sight. Vaik. (VI. 12 ) requires a brāhmaṇa bride to be a nagnikā or gauri, but does not prescribe the same qualification for a kṣatriya or vaisya bride. In the Harṣacarita princess Rajyasri is desoribed as quite grown-up at the time of her marriage which was consummated on the very day of marriage (vide the last para, of the 4th Ucchyāsa ). The Samskāra-prakasa 1060 expressly says that there is no prohibition against marrying a girl who has passed the age of puberty for ksatriyas and others. Even in Pauranio times grown-up unmarried girls must not have been unbeard of. The Gṛ. R. p. 83 quotes & passage from the Brahmapurāpa where the injunction to observe complete deli.

baoy for one year, 12 days, 6 days or 3 days is construed as respectively referring to girls whose ages were 8, 12, 16 or 20 at the time of marriage. 1061 

Another important question is inter-caste marriages. It has already been shown ( pp. 50-58 ) how anuloma marriages were allowed, while pratiloma unions were condemned and how it was supposed that numerous sub-castes arose from such mixed marriages. 

It is the contention of several eminent scholars (e. 8. Senart in his. Caste in India' translated by Ross p. 124 ) that caste as implied in modern usage and in its strict sense did not exist in the times of the Rgveda and the other Vedic Sambitas. We have seen, however, that the four varpas had been reco gnised in the times of the Samhitās and that ideas of superiority and inferiority due to being of a partioular varṇa had become quite prevalent. But the practices as to marrying outside one's varṇa and taking food had not become an rigid and cast-iron as they became in medieval times. A few clear examples of inter-caste marriages may be cited from the Vedic Literature. The Sat. Br. (IV.1.5, S. B. E. vol. 26, pp. 272-275) narrates the story of the old and decrepit sage Oyavana who Was & Bhargava ( descendant of Bbṛgu ) or Angirasa to Sukanyā, the daughter of king Saryata, & descendant of Manu. The Sat. Br. ( XIII. 2. 9. 8, 1068 S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 326 ) quotes a half Verse from the Vāj. 8. ( 26. 30 ) and then remarks therefore he does not anoint (as king) the son of the vaisya woman. This suggests that a king might marry & vaisya girl, but her son would not have the Vedic coronation ceremony performed on him. Verses 17-19 of the Rgveda V. 61 are interpreted by the Bphad-devata (V. 50 ) as referring to the marriage of the brahmana sage Syāyāśva to the daughter of king Rathaviti Darbhya. The story of Kavaṣa Ailūṣa who was styled' dāsyāḥ putra' ( either meaning the son of a dasi or used as a term of abuse ) by the Bages has been mentioned above ( at p. 36).

History of Dharmaśāsira 

C. IX 

Turning to the dharma and gļhya sūtras, the matter stands thus. Some of the gṛbya sūtras (like Aśv., Ap.) do not expressly say anything about the varṇa of the bride. The Ap. Dh. S. 1083 (II. 6. 13. 1 and 3) requires tbat one should inarry a girl of the game varṇa, who was not given before to another and marriage with whom is in accordance with śāstra and says that by contre vening these rules sin is inourred. So he condemns mixed marria ges. The Mānava gr. I.7.8 and Gaut. IV.1 require that one should marry a girl of the same varṇa and are silent about marriages with a bride of another varṇa. But Gautama knew of such marriages and enumerates the names of several sub-castes due to mixed marriages (IV. 14-17) and he includes among those who are unfit to be invited at a śrāddha dinner a brābmaṇa who is the husband of & woman of the sūdra caste (15.18). Manu (III. 12), Saṅkha and Nārada 1084 (stripumsa, v. 4) say that the best course is to marry a girl of one's own caste. This is said to be purva kalpa (the foremost or the best procedure). Many also speak of & less advisable course (anukalpa, as it is called ) viz. that a brāhmaṇa may take as wife a woman of any caste, a ksatriya may marry a woman of his own caste or a vaisya or a sūdra woman, a vaisga may marry & vaisya or sūdra woman and a sūdra only a sūdra woman. This is stated by Baud. Dh. S, I. 8. 2, Saṅkha, Manu III. 13, Vippu Dh. S. 24. 1-4. Pār. gr. I. 4 and Vas. Dh, S. 1065 I. 25 inform us that some teachers allowed a dvija to marry & sūdra woman but without Vedic mantras. But Vasiṣtba himself condemns it severely by saying 'one should not do so (i. e. marry a śūdra girl), for by doing so the degradation of the family is certain and loss of heaven after death'. Though the Viṣṇu Dh. S, and Manusmrti state that a dvijāti may marry a śūdra girl, that is not their own view, but they simply voice practices and sentiments prevalent in their time, since both denounce the marriage of a brābmapa with a sūdra girl in the most un-measured terms. Viṣṇu Dh, S. 26. 5-6 (S. B. E. vol. 7 p. 112 ) says that the union of a dvijati with a sūdra woman can never produce religious

Inter-caste marriages

merit; it is from carnal desire alone that be marries her being blinded by lust; and that dvijāti men who thus marry sūdra women quickly degrade their families and progeny to the status of sūdras'. The ancient editor of the Manusmrti did not tolerate such marriages (though he gave expression to the common trend of view in III. 12-13) and condemns a dvijati's marriage with a śūdra woman in the strongest language (III. 15-19, Manu III. 15 being the same as Viṣṇu Dh. S. 26.5) '& brāhmaṇa by having intercourse with a sūdra woman goes to hell and by procreating & son on her he loses his status as a brahmana'. Yāj. I. 57 allowed a brāhmaṇa or kṣatriya to marry a girl of his own varpa or of the varṇas next in order, but laid it down as his emphatic opinion that'a dvijāti should not marry a sūdra girl'. It appears however that prevailing public opinion and practice was too much for both Manu and Yāj.; for, both declare ( Yāj. II. 125 and Manu IX. 152-153 ) that when a brāhmaṇa has sons from wives of the four varṇas, the son of a brāhmaṇa wifo takes four shares (out of 10 in which his wealth is to be divided ), the son of a kṣatriya wife takes three, of a vaibya wife two and of a sūdra wife one. Yāj. ( I. 91-92 ) recognises the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a śūdra and says that the son of such a union is & pāraśava' Manu III. 44 also recognises the marriage of a śūdra girl with one of a higher class by saying that she holds the hem of the garment of a bridegroom of a higher class. 

This shows that the ancient smrtis ungrudgingly recognised inarriages between a brābmapa and a ksatriya or ā vaisya girl. But opinion was not unanimous about the marriage of a dvijāti with a sūdra woman, Such marriages took place, but were looked upon with disfavour and often condemned with severity. Anuloma marriages were frequent enough till the 9th or 10th century A. D., but became rare later and for the last several hundred years they hardly ever took place or they were not at all recognized as valid by the communities concerned. The epigraphio records furnish well authenticated instances of intor-caste marriages. The Vākatakas were brāhmaṇas (their gotra being Viṣṇuvžddha). The Poona plates of Prabb&vatigupta (E. I. vol. 15 p. 39 ) establish that she was a daughter of Candragupta II. (first quarter of 5th century A. D.) of the Imperial Gupta dynasty and became the chief queen of the king Rudrasena II of the Vakataka line. The Talaguṇda pillar inscription of the Kadamba king Kakusthavarman ( E. I. vol. 8 p. 24) recites that 

L. D. 57

the founder of the Kadamba family was Mayūrasarman, a brāhmaṇa, who being exasperated with the Pallavas of Kañol took up the sword. His descendants have names ending in varman (as kṣatriyas should have, according to Manu II. 32 ). The inscrip tion mentions that Kakusthavarman ( who was 4th in descent from Mayūrassrman) got his daughters married to Gupta and other kings. In the Ghatotkaca Inscription of Yaśodharman and Viṣṇuvardhana (A. S. W. I. vol. 4, p. 140 ) we are told that Soma, & brāhmaṇa and ancestor of Hastibhoja, minister of the Vākāṭaka king Devasena, gave his heart to wives born in brāhmaṇ& and kṣatriya families, The Tip perah copper-plate grant of a chieftain called Lokanatha (E. I. vol. 15, p. 301 ff) dated in the 44th year ( probably of the Harga era i. e. about 650 A. D.) says that Lokanātha's ancestors belonged to the Bharadvāja gotra (p. 306) and that the maternal grand-father of Lokanātha was Kesava who is said to have been a pāraśava (p. 307), wbile Keśava's father Vira was & brāhmaṇa (dvijasattama). Virūpādevi, a daughter of the famous Vijayanagara king Bukka I (1268-1298 A. D. ), was married to & brābmaṇa named Brabma or Bomanna Wodeya, who was the Governor of the Araga province ( E. I. vol. 15,p.12). Vide also E. I. vol. 18, p. 87 ( dated 894 of the Vikrama era ) for Pratibāra kings being descended from a brāhmana Hari candra and the latter's kṣatriya wife; the Ātpur Insoription of Śaktikumāra dated in sarnvat 1034 (977 A. D.) which states that the founder of the Gubila dynasty was a brāhmana Gubadatta, whose descendant Bhartspatta married a Rāṣtrakūta princess. 

Classical Sanskrit Literature also yields certain well known instances of inter-caste marriages. The Malavikāgnimitrs of Kalidasa shows that Agnimitra, a son of Senapati Puṣya. mitra of the Sunga dynasty and a brāhmaṇa, married Malavika who was a kṣatriya princess. In the Harsacarita of Bāpa (Ucchvāsa I towards end) we are told by Bāṇa himself that among the friends and companions of his wanderings there were bis two pāraśava brothers Candrasena and Mātrṣeṇa (i.e. step-brothers froin a sūdra wife of his father). Rajasekhara, teacher of king Mahendrapala of Kanoj, says in his Karpūra mañjarl( I. 11 ) that his accomplished wife Avantisundarl was descended from the Cahuāṇa (modern Chavan) family (i. e. from a kṣatriya family ). 

It is extremely diffioult to say when exactly inter-caste marriages even between dvijatis came to be prohibited by the

Interacaste marriages 

451 

smrtis and writers of digests. Viśvarūpa 5066 on Yāj. III. 283 ( not later than first half of 9th century ) olearly suggests that in his day a brahmana could marry a kṣatriya girl. Medha. tithi on Manu III. 14 suggests that about 900 A. D. at the latest marriages of brahmaṇas with kṣatriya and raisya girls took place rarely in his day, but not with sūdra women; and the Mito on Yaj. does not at all say that though marriages among dvijātis (anuloma ones) were allowed by Manu and Yaj, they had entirely ceased to be regarded as valid by its time. Many of the medieval digests and writers like the Sm. O. and Hemādri quote verses stated to be from the Aditya-purāṇa or Brahma-purāṇa on matters forbidden in the Kali age ( and so called Kalivariya) among which inter-caste marriages are inoluded. 

The Āpagtambalo17 smrti (in verse ed. by Jivananda 1, p. 549, chap. IX) says that by marrying a girl of another caste a man incurred the sin of mahāpātaka and had to undergo the penance of 24 kṛoohras. The Mārkandeya-purāṇa (113. 34-36 ) narrates the story of king Nābhāga who married a vaisya girl by the rākṣaga form of marriage and who consequently incurred sin.

The state of the law as to inter-caste marriages in British Indian courts may be briefly indiosted here. By the Special Marriage Act ( III of 1872 as amended by Aot XXX of 1923 ) both anuloma and pratiloma marriages are validated if they are registered and solemnized according to the procedure prescribed by the Act. But if & marriage is not so solemnized under that Act, but under the general rules of Hindu Law, then all pratiloina marriages are invalid throughout British India,

But anuloma 1068 marriages have been recognised as valid by some High Courts in India; the Allahabad High Court, however regards all anuloma marriages even as invalid. 

The next restriction that the girl to be married must not be a sapiṇda of the bride-groom has now to be considered. Sapinda relationship is of special importance in three matters, viz. marriage, inheritance and āśauca 1068 (impurity on birth and death). The prohibition against marriage with a sapipda girl applies to all varṇas including the sūdra 1970. There are two schools about the meaning of sapiṇda, one represented by the Mitāksarā and the other by Jimūtavahana (author of the Dāyabhāga). Both are agreed that a sapinda girl cannot be married, but they differ as to the meaning of the word. We shall first understand one interpretation of sapiṇda. The locus classicus is the commentary of Vijñānesvara on Yāj. I. 52-53 a substantial portion of which is translated here : ** asapiṇ. dām' (in Yaj. I. 52 ) meang a woman who is not a sapinda and sapinda means one who has the same piṇda i, e. body (or particles of the body). Sapiṇda relationship (between two persons ) arises from (their) being connected by having partioles of the same body. Thus, the son has sapinda relationship with his father by reason of the ( fact that ) particles of the father's body oontinue in him (the son). Similarly ( there is sapinda rela tionship) with the paternal grandfather and the like (of the

Similarly (the son haq sapinda relationship) with his mother because particles of the mother's body continue in him. Thus (& person has sapinda relationship) with his mother's father through his mother; 80 (one has sapiṇdatā) with one's mother's sister or mother's brother also by reason of the connection with (or continuity of) particles of the same body (viz. the body of the naternal grandfather). So also (a person has sapiṇdatā) with the paternal uncle, the paternal aunt and the like. Similarly the wife has sapinda rolationship with the busband because she produces ( with the husband) one body (viz. their son). 1071 In the same way brother's wives (are sapiṇdas) of each other, because they produce one body ( viz. their respective sons ) with their respective husbands who are produced from one body (viz. their busbands' father). In this manner wherever the word sapiṇda ooours, there one has to understand connection with (or continuity of)

UT 979T RETETYT TCTT1977are translated differently by Golap Chandra Sarkar in his Hindu Law (7th od. of 1936 ) pp. 81-82 as 'similarly arises tho sapinda relationsbip of the husband with the lawfully wedded wife by reason of their togethor) forming one body'(i. o. one person, bence the wife is called half the body of the husband). The learned author thinks that his translation is the correct one and others went wrong in translating as in the passago above. His translation oan not be accepted for several roas008. In the first place, it is opposed to the explanation of the Baļambbatti SITTHwafa TOTEU artit Tutarref: (i, e. particles of tho bodies of the husband and wife continue in or are concerned with one body, the son, that is produced by them both). Tbat husband and wifo are one is a pleasant fiction but here Vijñanodvara is stressing the physical continuity of particlos. The husband and wifo though said to be ono are still two bodies. No one says that their bodies become physically one. Besides the objection that if thoy do not beget a son, the husband and wife will not be sapiṇdas is not sound. Rules and principles are laid down for generality of cases and regard is to be had to their capacity to produce a 800. The forcing (III. q . p. 280) shows that G. C. Sarkar is wrong 'Tento rochtaart CITRATE 49 go पौत्रादिषुसाक्षात् परंपरा पा शुक्रशोणितादिरूपेणावस्यूताः । पचपिपल्या पत्यासह भ्रात पत्नीनां च परस्परं नैतत्संभवति तथापि आधारवेकशरीरावयवान्दयोऽस्येव ।। A woman's busband's brother's wifo is the receptacle ( Adhara ) for a son who is procreated by the husband's brother and his wifo, the former of whom has partioles of his father whose particles continue in the husband of the woman. 




partioles of the same body either direotly or mediately. 1071 On the word 'asapiṇdām' it was explained that sapiṇda rela tionship arises immediately or mediately by reason of the conneo tion with partioles of the same body; this may prove to be too wide a statement, since in this beginningless sansāra, such a rela. tionship might exist in some way or other between all men; 1978 therefore ( the sage Yajñavalkya) states' after the fifth on the mother's side and after the 7th on the father's side. After the fifth on the mother's side i. e. in the mother's line and after the 7th on the father's side 1. e. in the father's line sapinda relationship ceases. These words ( viz sapiṇda ... ... Deases) are to be taken as understood ( in the text of Yaj.). Therefore the word 'sapiṇda' though it applies everywhere (i. e. to a very wide circle of persons ) by the expressive (i. e. literal) power of its component parts, is restricted to a certain definite sphere, like the words nirmanthya' 10%* and 'pankaja'. And so the six ( ascendants ) beginning with the father and the six descendants beginning with the son and the man himself as the seventh ( in each case ) are sapiṇdas; wherever there is & divergence of the line, the counting shall be made until the seventh in descent is reached including him (i, e. the ancestor ) from whom the line diverges; in this way the computation is to be made everywhere. And so the fifth ( if a girl ), who stands in the fifth generation when a computation is made beginning with the mother and going up to her ( mother's ) father, mother's paternal grandfather &c., is styled in an indirect way 'fifth

from the mother's side' (by Yaj.). In the same way the seventh from the father's side' (in Yāj.).is she who is the seventh in degree (from an ancestor) when computation is made beginning from the father and proceeding up to the father's father and so on". . According to this explanation of the Mitaksara 1075 the following rules about prohibition based on sāpiṇdy& follow: (1) In computing degrees the common ancestor is to be included; (2) regard is to be had to the fatber and mother of the bride and bridegroom both; (3) if computation is made from the mother's side of either the proposed bride or bride groom, they must be beyond the fifth degree (i. e. they must be 6th or further on) from the common ancestor and if it is made through the father of either, they must be beyond the seventh from the common ancestor ( i. e. they must be eighth &c.). This last postulates four different classes of cages, viz. descent from a common ancestor may be traced through the fathers of both bride and bridegroom or through the mother of both, or through the mother of the bridegroom and the father of the bride or through the father of the bride groom and the mother of the bride. The method of computing degrees is entirely different from the English method as is made clear by the remarks of the Mit. translated above. The rules require that both must be beyond sapiṇda relationship as defined and limited above. For example, tracing descent through the fathers of both bride and bridegroom, if the bride is 8th from the common ancestor ( called kūļastha in dharmaśāstra works ) and the bridegroom is 6th, there can be no marriage, as though the bride is beyond the limits of sapiṇda relationship to the common ancestor, the bridegroom being 6th from the kūtastha has sapiṇda relationship with the kūtastha. These rules apply according to the Mit. only where the ancestors married women of their own varṇa. But if an ancestor married a brahmana girl and also a kṣatriya girl and a question arose about the eligibility of marriage among descendants of these two wives, then prohibition based on sapiṇda relationship extends up to only three degrees (and not seven or five ). 10754

It should not be supposed that these rules of the Mit. are universally observed. The texts themselves are in conflict, Further, the customs and usages as to prohibited degrees for marriage are so divergent in the various parts of India and among the hundreds of castes and sub-castes that it is impossible to state any rule as universally or even generally applicable. A few examples of conflict among the smrtis are cited by the Mit. itself. Vas. Dh. S. (8.2) says '(he may marry ) the fifth on the mother's side and 7th on the father's side', while Yāj. as interpreted by the Mit. makes it necessary that the girl to be eligible must be 6th from the common ancestor traced through the mother and 8th when traced through the father. Paighinasi says the girl must be beyond three degrees on the mother's 1070 side and five degrees on the father's side'. These two are explained away by the Mit. by saying that these texts do not authorise a marriage with & girl who is distant from the common ancestor by a legger number of degrees than those propounded by Yāj. but they only prohibit marriage with girls who are nearer in degrees than those stated in those texts. But this reconciliation of the conflict among the smrtis is not at all satisfactory. 

The following diagrams illustrate the application of the rules of sapiṇda relationship according to the Mitakṣarā. In all of them A represents the cominon ancestor and the letters Sand D represent respectively sons and daughters. According to the Mit. computation has to be made from ( and inclusive of ) the common ancestor in all cases and both the bride and bride groom have to be beyond the prohibited degrees. 1077

Here a marriage oannot take place botwaon D (6) and S (6) as the sa pinda relationship in the latter's oase is to be traced tbrough his father and be is not more than seven degrees removed from the common ancestor, though D (6) whose sapinda rela tionship is to be traced through her mother is more than five degrees from the common ancostor. A00 ording to Balambhatta and some others marriage will take place as D(6) is beyond five degrees ( traoing through her mother), though 8(6) is within 7 degrees (tracing desoont through bis fatber) and so is not outside sapinda limits. 

All these four examples are taken from the Dharmasindhu (III Pūrvārdha p. 226-227). No. 3 illustrates what is called

sapiṇda relationship by 'frog's leap,1018 Just as a frog leaps from one spot to another leaving intervening objects untouobed, 80 in this example No. 3, there is sāpiṇdy& between D(5) and D(5), but 8(6) and D(6) are left unaffected by sāpindya ( as relationship is traced through the mothers of both ), while sāpiṇdya reverts to affect D(7) and 8(?). The maxim of * frog's leap is a very ancient one, being exemplified by the Mahābhāṣya of Patafjali.1079 

The rules about prohibition of marriage on the ground of sapiṇda relationship, particularly where cognates (persons oonnected through females) were concerned, have not been observed in numerous instances over wide areas from very ancient times. One striking illustration is the question whe ther a man can marry his maternal unole's or his paternal aunt's daughter, particularly the former. On this point opinion has been sharply divided from ancient times. Ap. Dh. 8. 1. 7. 21. 8 includes among pataniya actions (mortal sins) sexual intercourse with the uterine relations ( mothers and sisters ) of one's parents and their children. This would prohibit marriage with one's maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter, Baud. Dh. S. I.1080 1. 19-26 notes that there were five practices peculiar to the south viz. eating in the company of one whose upanayana has not been performed, to eat in the company of one's wife, to eat stale food, to marry the daughter of the maternal uncle or of & paternal aunt and there were five practices peculiar to the north. Then he proceeds to state the argument that those who follow the practices mentioned by him in countries other than those where they prevail incur sin, that Gautama (XI. 20) holds this last argument to be wrong and then Baud. states his own

view that one should pay no heed to either set of practices, as both are opposed to smrtis and the views of śiṣṭas. - From this it is olear that a marriage with one's maternal uncle's daughter or paternal aunt's daughter was in vogue in the south ( below the Narmada probably) long before the Baud. Dh. S. (1. e. several centuries before the Christian ora ) and that North India did not go in for such marriages and that orthodox sutra writers like Gautama and Baudbāyana reprobated such practices. Manu (XI. 172-173 ) forbids such marriages " on approaching (for carnal intercourse ) the daughter of one's father's sister or of one's mother's sister or of mother's full brother, a man must undergo the penance called 'cāndrāyana'. A wise man should not take as his wife (any one of ) these; they are not fit to be wedded because they are (sapinda ) relatives, for by wodd. ing them one sinks low ( i. e. falls into hell or loses caste)". Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16 quotes & verse from Śatātapa 1981 prescribing the penance of candrāyaṇa for marrying one's maternal uncle's daughter or a girl having the same gotra as one's mother's gotra (i. e. maternal grandfather's gotra ) or & sapravara girl and a text of Sumantu forbidding marriage with the daughter of the brother of one's mother or step-mother. It would be seen that all these relatives are third from the common ancestor and so are very much within the probibition against marrying & sapiṇda, whatever be the number of prohibited degrees for marriage that are accepted. Kumārila in his Tantravārtika while discussing the scope and validity of sadācāra ( on Jaimini I.3.7) enumerates many lapses from good conduct attributed to great men and heroes of the past and tries to explain away those violations of good conduct. The cbarge brought against Vāsudeva (Krsns) and Arjuna, the central heroes of the Mahābhārata, is that they respectively married Rukmini and Subhadrā who were their maternal uncle's daughters ( this being forbidden). Kumārila makes very soathing remarks against this practice 10% prevalent among southerners and then refutes this charge by saying that although in the Mahabharata (Adiparva 219. 17–18) Subhadra is described as the daughter of

Vasudeva and sister 1083 of Krṣṇa, she was really not 89, but that she was Vāsudeva's mother's sister's daughter or was the daughter's daughter of the sister of the father of Vasudeva's mother (or step-mother Rohini ).1086 Kumārila argues that such female cousins one degree or Beveral degrees removed are often spoken of as sisters. Vide my notes to the Vyavahāramayūkha pp. 200-202 where this matter is fully explained. This reply of Kumārila well illustrates the method of dealing with inconvenient texts adopted by msmāṁsakas like Kumārila when the texts run coun ter to their cherished views. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. III. 254 quotes Manu XI. 172 and verses of Samyarta prescribing the penance of Parāka for carnal intercourse with one's maternal unole's daughter. 1085 Medbātithi on Manu II. 18 refers to this practioe as prevalent in some countries, and says it is opposed to the rule of Gautama (IV. 3 ) about probibition on the ground of sāpindya and explains how such practices might have arisen. Persons making love to the handsome daughters of their maternal uncles married them for fear that they might otherwise be punished by the king; it may be that others literally following the words of Manu IV. 178 held by the practice which their fore fathers resorted to for fear of punishment. 1086 Among medieval writers, some condemn this practice, others justify it. Aparārka (pp. 82-84 ) after a lengthy discussion condemns marriage with maternal unole's daughter, The Nirnayasindhu also does the same (p. 286 ). 

Among those who support marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter the most prominent are the Sm. C. ( I. pp. 70-74) and the Par. M. (1. 2. pp. 63-68). They both admit that there are

passages of Manu, Śatātapa, Sumantu (all quoted above) and others condemning marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter, yet they say that there are passages of the Veda and some smstis in support of it and sistas (learned and respect able persons ) observe this practice and 80 such marriages are sadācāra and not forbidden. They rely upon two Vedlo passages; one is from the Sat. Br. I. 8. 3. 6 (S. B. E. vol. XII. p. 238 ) " thus the separation ( of the eater and the eaten ) is effected in one and the same act; hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer (the husband) and the enjoyed ( the wife); for now kinsfolk live sporting and rejoicing together saying in the fourth or tbird man (generation ) we shall unite'. And this is so in accordance with that (separa tion of the spoons )." 1087 The mention of the union in the third generation is understood by the Sm. C. 88 referring to the marriage of a person with his maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter. Viśvarapa also refers to this passage ( on Yaj. 1.53), but he does not draw the inference that such marriages are authorized by the Veda. Another Vedic verse is relied upon by the Sm. O. and Par. M and other works. It is a verse from a Khila sūkta Come, 0 Indra, by commended paths to this our sacrifice and partake of your portion. They (the priests ) have offered the fat seasoned with ghee that is thy portion, as the maternal uncle's daughter or the paternal aunt's daughter (is one's lot in marriage ) 1088 This verse is referred to by Viśvarūpa on Yāj.( I. 53 ) but his explanation of it is different viz. that it really indicates one out of four different alternatives

as regards prohibited degrees for marriage.1089 Aparārka (p. 83) on Yaj. I. 53 reads the latter balf somewhat differently and 80 interprete it as to spell out of it a prohibition against marrying a maternal uncle's daughter. This text is quoted in I. L. R. 7 Mad. 548 at p. 550. The Smrtio:ndrikā relies upon & passage of the Caturvimsatimata that allows a marriage of persons who are third or fourth in descent from a common ancestor on both sides (on the mother's or father's side ). There is also a text of Bphaspati which presoribes that the practices of the countries, castes and families should be guarded (or enforced) by the king as they have been in vogue from past times, otherwise the subjects becoine inflamed and among buch practices he instances 'Brāhmaṇas in the south marry the maternal uncle's daughter. 1090 So there is smrti authority for Buch marriages. Besides southern śistas deeply read in the Vedas and acting according to the meaning of the Veda prac tise marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter. Here both Sm. C. and Par. M. are on very firm ground. The Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha bays' among the Andhras sistas deeply read in the Vedas follow the practice of mālulasulā-pariṇayana and among the Dravidas respectable people allow marriage of & person with a girl who is fourth in descent from the common ancestor',1031 Among several castes in the Dacoan and the Madras Presidenoy, not only is marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter allowed, but it is highly commended. Even certain brābmapa castes like the Desastha brāhmaṇas of the Karnataka and Karbādā brāhmaṇas observe this practice in modern times. The Samskārakaustubha (pp. 616-620 ) and the 

Dharmasindhu support mātulasutā-pariṇayana. 

Both the Sm. O. and Par. M. say that though the Vedic passage from the Satapatba is a mere arthavāda ( a laudatory statement) in praise of & Vedic act, yet on the analogy of the words 'he holds ( the samidb ) above the sruo) for gods', which

are construed by Jaimini ( III. 4. 15 ) 88 a vidhi (as & positive rule) on socount of their apūrvatva ( not being known from any other source ), these words of the Satapatha are also to be con strued as a vidhi ( of the marriage with maternal uncles daughter ). 1098 The Sm. C. also pregaes into service the Vedic verso ( Rg. X. 16, 5 ) addressed by Yami to Yama. But that mantra does not clearly refer to cross-cousin marriages. 

The smrti pasgages that condemn cross-cousin marriages are explained in a peculier manner by the Sm, C. and the Par. M. When a woman is married in one of the four forms, brāhma &c., she passes into the gotra of her husband, becomes & sapiṇda in the husband's family and so she is revered from her father's family (as to gotra and sapiṇda relationship); but when a woman is married in the asura, gāndharva and other forms, she does not pass over into the gotra of her husband, but remains in the gatra of the father and her sapiṇda relationship with her father and brother continues. Therefore the son of such a woman, if he marries the daughter of his mother's brother, would be marrying a girl who is & Bagotra and sapinda of his mother. The Sm. C. and the Par, M. and other works say that the smrti texts forbidding marriage with maternal unole's daughter refer to a person whose mother was married in the gāndbarva, asura and the other two forms, but not to a person whose mother was married in the brahma and the three other approved forms. 

This is the reasoning of the Sm, C. and the Par. M.1093 

1092, Jaimini'a satra is feftat rostera III.4.15. This is not com mented upon by Sabara ; but the Tantravārtika, wbich poticos this fact, assigns several reasons for tbis omission and explains it as follows: in the au t hore is a passage TURPIENTAU UNTY

In the homa for pilis the samidh is beld bolow the sruc in which the havis bas boon placed ; in tbis passage it is said that when tho oblation is to be offered to tho gods the sainidh is to be held over tbo sruo (in wbich the oblation is placod before boing thrown into the fire). Hero though the particle bi' (slowing reason) is einployed and tbougl, the prosent 'dbarayati' is used (and not the potential as is usual in ridhis), it is not a more arthavada but a vidhi. So also in the Bat. Br. thore is a vidhi about matula-suta parinayana.'

I/islory of Dharmaśāstra 

[ Chu IX 

These rules about probibition on the ground of sapinda relationship cause great difficulties in modern times, when owing to the rapid spread of co-education and the rise in the marriageable age of girls, love marriages have become some what frequent. Lovers do not stop to consider such (to them ) trivial matters as sapiṇda relationship, but the law is often inexorable. The narrowing of the limits of sapipda relationship is permitted by the authors of commentaries and digests only on the ground of immemorial family, caste or local usage. For example, the same authors, who hold that marriage with the maternal uncle's daughter is sanctioned by Vedic texts and custom, condemn and forbid marriage with one's paternal aunt's daughter or with one's maternal aunt's daughter (vide below ). There are a few Verees oited from the smptis which favour the narrowing down of sapinda relationship. For example, the Caturvimsatimata 08?« states' According to Sākaṭāyana there is no blame in marrying a girl wbo is 7th or 6th or 5th (from the common ancestor); similarly Manu, Pārāśarya, Yams and Angiras say that one may marry a girl who is third or fourth (from the common ancestor) on both sides (i. e. from her father's side or mother's side). Whoever enters into such marriage alliances by relying on the usage of bis country or of his family is always entitled to associate with people and this is seen from the Veda'. Parāśara (as quoted in the Nirṇayasindhu and other works ) says a man who is himself fourth or fifth (from the common ancestor ) may according to Parāśara's view marry a girl who is 4th or 6th (from the common ancestor ), but one who is himself fifth cannot marry a girl who is also fifth (from the common ancestor). The Samskārakaustubha, the Sāpindyadipika and a few digests hold these verses authorita tive and allow such marriages provided they are in accordance with local or family usage. As against this the following facts have to be remembered. One of the maxims of interpretation is that where there is conflict between smști texts, the preferable rule is to follow the opinion of the majority.10986 Gaut., Manu,

Marriage-sapinda relationship 

465 

Yaj, Marloi and numerous other smptikaras are opposed to these diota. The second rule is that Manu has the highest authority among smptis and that smrti which is opposed to the dicta of Manu is not commended.10934 The above passages are opposed to the words of Manu on sapiṇda relationship and about marry. ing a maternal uncle's daughter ( Manu V. 60, III. 5, XI. 171 172). A third point about the above texts is that several eminent works like the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharmasindhu 10888 hold that some of these Verses are baseless and not genuine and that they really refer to persons adopted or persons des cended from wives of different castos of the same common ancestor; and lastly even those works that support such narrow ing of sapinda relationship for marriage do not advocate it for all and sundry, but only where there is & local or family Ugage to that affect. Therefore, marriages among persons who are 3rd or 4th or 5th from the common ancestor cannot be regarded as valid in general, but only on the ground of usage. The following diagram will furnish some examples of the narrowing down of sapiṇda relationship.

will not be valid according to the 2nd proviso to sec. %. The Nirnayasindhu 1083 * was not prepared to concede that such marriages, though not the best, were at least allowable as inferior (anukalpa). The Dharmasindhu 1093! stated that only in calamities when one is unable to secure a girl one may enter into & marriage where sapiṇde relationship is narrowed down, but that those who can secure another girl should not go in for it, as the sin of incest would be incurred. Such marriages did not take place except during the last few years and so the courts have not yet pronounced on their validity. The preceding remarks are made by way of caution only and it is quite possible that courts may find out some way to uphold the marriages when they come before them many years after their celebration. But it is well to remember that the validity of such marriages in oastes that have no usage to that effect is, to say the least, doubtful. 

There is a great 1094 deal of discussion in the smrtis and nibandhas on the gotra of a woman. Aśv. gr. 8. I. 8. 12 is interpreted by some as laying down that husband and wife become of one gotra one year after marriage. Laghu Harita appears to refer to this and also proposes an option that she takes up the husband's gotra immediately after marriage. Yama 86 and Likbita 25 say that after marriage on the 4th night a bride becomes one with her husband as to gotra, pinda and āśauca ; while Yama 78 and Likhita 26 state that she loses her father's gotra on taking the seventh step. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 254 has a long note on this subject, states that there are two views and finally reaches the conolusion that a woman retains her father's gotra even after marriage for pindadāna, if she was & putrikā or wag married in the Āgura and the following forms ; but if she was married in the brāhma and other approved

Both of them allow a person's marriage with his paternal aunt's daughter. Certain inscriptions at Nāgārjunikonda (of about the 3rd century A. D.) establish that the king Siri Virapu risadata, son of Siri Cbāntamūla who had performed the Vājapeya, Aśvamedha and other sacrifices, married & daughter of his paternal aunt ( E. I. vol. 20 at p. 4). There are other authors, however, who, while allowing marriage with a maternal unole's daughter, disallow it with & paternal aunt's daughter, For example, the Nirnayasindhu says that, though it follows from the same Vedic passages that one's paternal aunt's daughter may be married, yet such a marriage should not be contracted as it is hateful to the people, as there are no other passages laying down the advisability of such marriages. 9o95 Similarly the Sm. O. (I. p.71 ) and Par. M.( I. 2. p. 65 ) say that though marriage with one's mother's sister or mother's sister's daughter also should be allowed on the same grounds as those urged in favour of the marriage with the maternal uncle's daughter, yet it is forbidden since it is condemned by sistas and is hateful to the people and both again rely on Yāj.

Another and a very striking instance of the limits of sapiṇda relationship not being observed is the practice among certain seotions of even brāhinanas ( such as some Deśasthas in Karnataka and Mysore ) marrying their own sister's daughter (i.e. their own niece ). Vide Mandlik's Hindu Law p. 425. In Ramangavda v. Shivaji, the Bombay High Court held that marriage with one's sister's daughter was invalid among brāhmaṇas; but in that oase no custom as to the validity of

such marriages was alleged 1097. In Vellanki Ramakrishna v. Kotagiri Subbamma 13 Mad. 830 at p. 834 it is stated that in the Velama caste a man may marry his sister's daughter. 

On account of these disergenoes about the limits of probi. bited dogrces for marriage it appears that the remarks of the Sarhskārakaustubha (p. 620) and of the Dharmasindhu (p. 228) are most sensible and practical. They say that even in the Kali age 1098 those, in whose families or countries the limits of sapiṇda relationship are narrowed down and marriage with the maternal uncle's daughter has been in vogue for ages, may do so, that they incur no blame by such marriages, that others (among whom there is no such custom) may without blame invite such persons for sraddhas and may take girls from their families in marriage and that the passages quoted by Hemādri forbidding their being invited at śrāddhas only apply to those who marry a maternal uncle's daughter even though they have 

no such family or local usage.1039 

Another question is how far sapinda relationship holds good in the case of girls belonging to the family from which one's step-mother comes. The Udvāhatattva (p. 118), the Nirnayasindhu (p. 289), the Sam. Pr. (pp.695-699), Samskara Kaustubha (pp. 621-630) and the Dharmasindhu (p. 230) deal with this matter. They all rely on a text of Sumantu "100 'all the wives of one's father are mothers, the brothers of these are one's maternal unoles, their sisters are one's mother's sisters, the daughters of these are one's sisters and the children of these

Marriage-sapinda relationship

latter are one's sister's children; otherwise there would be samkara ( confusion)'. Two interpretations are placed on this, one view (and that is held by most ) is that this lays down sāpindya only with the persons specifically mentioned, hoi whilo another view (this is held by the Sam. Pr.) is that there is sāpindya for four generations from the father of one's step mother. According to the first view a man cannot marry the daughter or grand-daughter of his step-mother's brother or sister, but his own daughter can marry the son of his step mother's brother; while according to the second view the latter marriage also would contravene the rule about this extension (alidesa) of sāpiṇdya. 

Marriages with certain girls were forbidden by certain writers on the ground of what is called 'viruddhasainbandha ', although there is no question of sapiṇda relationship in such cases. The Ghya-parisista '108 ( quoted in the Nirnayasindhu p. 289) prescribes 'one should marry a girl with whom there is no viruddhasambandha, e.g, the daughter of one's wife's sister or the sister of one's paternal uncle's wife (these should not be married), Viruddhasambandha (incompatible relation ) occurs where the standing of the proposed bridegrooin and the bride would resemble that of father or mother to the other (or of brother and sister). In modern times such marriages take place as a matter of course and no court would declare them to be invalid. Vide I. L. R. 20 Mad. 283 and I. L. R. 43 Mad. 830 where marriage with one's wife's sister's daughter was held to be valid, among brāhiapas as well as sūdras in the Telugu and Tamil distriots, relying on Mandlik's Hindu Law pp. 484-485 and other autho rities. In Ramchandra v. Gopal 32 Bom. 619 at pp. 630-631 the court approves of the decision in 20 Mad, 283 and holds that the dicta as to viruddha-sambandha are only recommendatory,

About the sapinda relationship of the adopted son as regards marriage, asauoa and graddha a good deal is said in many works such as Sam, K. (pp. 182-186 ), Nirnayasindhu (pp. 290-291 ), the Vyavabāramayūkba, the Sarn, Pr. (pp. 688-694 ), Sam. R. M. (pp. 453-456 ). Sāpiṇdya for āśauca and frāddba will be dealt with later on. As to sāpipdya for marriage in the case of adoption there is great divergence of views. The Sam. Pr. (p. 690) says that the son given in adoption has sāpindya for seven genera tions with his genitive father and for three generations with the adoptive father (pp. 693-694 )."103 The Sam, K. appears to hold, after quoting several views, that if the upanayang of the adopted boy was performed in the family of birth, then he has sāpindya with the genitive family for seven generations. But if the ceremonies from jātakarma to upanayana are performed in the adoptive family then he has sāpindya in the adoptive family for seven generations, but only for five generations if only upanayana is performed in the family of adoption. The Nirnayasindhu gives its own view that thers is sāpindya in both families for seven generations. The Vyavahāramayūkha holds ( following Gautama IV. 3 ) that in the case of kevala dattaka (the ordinary adopted son) sapinda relationship extends to seven degrees in the adoptive father's family and five degrees in the adoptive mother's family. 1104 The Dharma sindhu follows the Sam. 6. generally but it makes one significant remark. It says that several writers hold that in the case of dattaka, sāpiṇdya is to be observed for a lesser number of degrees (than seven or five ) in both families."105 The Samn, R. M.(p. 454 ) says that the limits of sāpiṇdya spoken of as applying to an adopted person extend to his children also. "106 As the limits of sāpindya for marriage are very muoh narrowed down when marriage with one's maternal unolo's daughter or one's niece is allowed, on the other hand certain communities extend such limits too much.

Marriage in mother's original gotra

marry a girl whose father's gotra is the same as the gotra of the bridegroom's maternal grandfather. Manu III. 5 lays down *that girl who is not a sapiṇda of the motber (of the bridegroom) and who is not a sagotra of the father of the bridegroom ) is commended in the case of twice-born classes'. Many com mentators and digests like Kullūka, the Madana-pārijāta (p. 132), the Dipakalikā, the Udvābatattva (p. 107 ) understand the word asagotra (in Manu III. 5 ) after matuh' also, and thus forbid marriage with a girl whose gotra is the same as that of one's mother (i. e, of one's maternal grandfather). Medhātithi 1107 on Manu III. 5 quotes & text of Vasiṣtha which prescribes the penance of candrāyana for marrying a girl who has the same gotra as the bridegroom's mother ( i.e. his mother's father) and abandonment of her. Haradatta on Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16 quotes a similar verse from Śatātapa. Kullūka, the Sun. O. (I. p. 69 ), Haradatta on Āp. Dh. S. II. 5. 11. 16, the Gr. R. (p. 10), Udvahatattva p. 107 and other digests quote a verse of Vyāsa' some do not desire for marriage a girl who has the same gotra as one's mother; but one may marry without question (or fear) a girl when her birth and name (as connected with one's mother's original gotra ) are unknown'. A woman on marriage loses her original gotra and passes over into the gotra of her husband; 80 the words 'sagotra' of the mother simply mean "having the same gotra as one's mother once had in her maiden state'. The Sm. C. (I. p. 69 ) takes this Verse to refer only to a woman who was made an appointed daughter (putrikā) by her father. Halā yudha also hold the same view. But other writers do not approve of this ( vide the Gr. R., p. 10). The Nirnayasiadbu 1108 (III. pūrvārdha p. 302 ) forbids marriage with a girl who is sagotra of one's mother, but the sam. K. (p. 693 ) and the Dharmasindhu both say, after quoting a text of Satyāṣadha, that this restriction applies only to those who study the Madhyan. dina sākha.

Rasta word sapinda is that is offered interpretation 

The Bengal school represented by the Dayabhāga and Raghunandana differ from the Mitakṣarā in the interpretation of the word 'sapinda'. In this system the word 'piṇda' is taken to mean 'the ball of rice' that is offered in sraddhas to deceased ancestors &o. (while under the Mit. interpretation 'pinda' means body or partioles of body ). Sapiṇda means 'one who is connected with another through oblations of food'. The author of the Dayabhaga propounds his theory with reference to inheri. tance and he himself says that with reference to aśauca 1109 sapiṇda relationship is to be differently understood. Further Jimūtavāhana does not set forth his theory of sapiṇda relation ship with reference to marriage. His theory is that in matters of inheritance the guiding principle is the spiritual benefit ( upa kārakatva ) conferred on the deceased through oblations of food, and be relies on Manu (IX. 106) for this proposition. For his sapiṇda theory he principally relies on two passages, Baud. 1110 Dh. 8. I. 5. 113-115 and Manu IX. 186-187, Baudhayana's words are the paternal great-grand-father, the paternal grand father, the father, the man himself, his full brothers, his son, grandson and son's son from a woman of the same varpa: all these participating in undivided daya (heritage ) are called gapindag. Those who participate in divided daya are called sakulyas. Thus issue of the body existing, wealth goes to them; on failure of sapiṇdas, the sakulyas'. The text of Manu (IX. 186-187) is 'To three, libations of water must be given; towards three pinda proceeds; the fourth is the giver of these (of water and pindas ), there is no fifth properly (concerned in this). Whoever is the nearest among sapiṇdas, his becomes the wealth of him (who dies). After him the sakulya be comes (the heir) &o. Jimūtavahana's explanation of this text is as follows: 'A man when living offers piṇdas to his three male ancestors ; but when he himself dies, his son performs

Thus those to whom he offers piṇdas and those who offer pindas to him are called, since they share in undivided oblations, avibhaktadāyāda sapiṇdas. Several objections can be raised against the theory of Jimātavāhana. In the first place he assigns the meaning of pinda to the word dāya in Baudhāyana's passage for which there is no warrant. Baudbāyana really means tbat those enumerated by him are called sapiṇdas who take undivided wealth i. e. who constitute an undivided family. In the next place on his interpretation the word sapinda has to be interpreted in entirely different ways for āśauoa and marriage. Besides he himself is not sure of his ground, since he says that although learned men may not approve of his theory that spiritual benefit is the guiding principle in taking property by inheritance they must admit that the order of heirs as stated by him relying on Manu IX. 186-187 is the proper one.

Śrikṭspa, a commentator of the Dāyabhaga and author of Dayakramasamgraha, and Raghunandana, author of Smptitattva, and others elaborate these rules. The Full Bench of the Caloutta High Court in Guru Govind Shaha Mandal 1118 v. Anand Lal Ghose Mazumdar gives an elaborate statement of the geveral sapiṇdas. But as those rules have reference only to succession, they are passed over here. Raghunandana in his work on marriage called Udvābatattva "14 quotes the famous verse of the Matsyapurāṇa, 'the fourth and (two beyond him) among ascendants are partakers of lepa ( the leavings of the boiled rice that become attached to the hand of him who offers pindas ), the father and the rest( i. e. two more beyond bim ) are partakers of the pinda; he who offers the piṇda to them is the seventh ; sāpiṇdya extends to seven generations and refers the readers to his Suddhitattva for elucidation. Raghunandana does not give any definition of sapindas for marriage, but discusses the confliot about the several texts such as '7th on the father's side and 5th on the mother's side'. He expressly says (p. 110 of Udvābatattva) that the words 'who is not a sapinda of one's mother' are still applicable even if several females intervene between the common ancestor and the girl proposed to be married. He then adds & special rule that descendants of what are called pitṛbandhus and mātsbandhus also are for bidden if they are within 7 degrees and 5 degrees respectively from these bandbus. The pitbandhus 1115 of a person are his paternal grand-father's sister's sons, bis paternal grandmother's aister's sons and his father's maternal uncle's sons; while mātrbandhus are & person's mother's father's sister's sons, inother's mother's sister's sons, mother's maternal uncle's song. These two latter may be illustrated by two diagrams.

In the ascending line only the descendants of the common ancestors are excluded. For example, SI is a pitrbandbu and his descen. dants up to 7 degrees are excluded; but Si's father is not a bandhu of the bridegroom; therefore Sl's father's sister may be married by the bridegroom. Under this rule the 6th descendant (& girl) of Sl will be ineligible for marriage with A: but she will be 9th from A's grandfather's father who is the common ancestor. So it will be seen that this goes far beyond the limits of sāpiṇdys generally prescribed and there is no valid reason assigned for this.

N. B.--Here S1, S2 and 83 are mātṛbandhus of the bride groom. The maternal great-grandfather is the starting point in calculating prohibited degrees in the mother's paternal line. In the mother's maternal line the starting points are S2 and 83. In the ascending lines of the mātsbandhus the descendants of only the common anoestur are excluded. For example, the girl descended from S3's maternal ancestors may be married by the bridegroom and so also a girl descended from the paternal ancestor of S2 or $1. 

Another rule propounded by Raghunandana is that even within prohibited degrees a valid marriage may be contracted if three gotras intervene. In the case of girls descended from pitbandhus and mātṛbandhus the computation of gotra must be made from them. For want of space it is not thought advisable to illustrate this by citing several examples. But one example is given to illustrate this rule.

Here according to the Bengal school S (4) can marry D (4) because three gotras intervene between her and the common ancestor, although S4 is only 5th in descent from the common ancestor; for according to the Bengal school it is not necessary that both the bridegroom and the bride be beyond the limits of sapiṇdaship, but only the bride need be so; while according to many writers of the Mitākṣarā school both must be beyond the limits of sapiṇdaship from the common ancestor."118

Sapinda relationship under Dāyabhāga 

477 

The Dayabhāga does not rely upon any Vedic passages for its theory of sapinda relationship. The Mit. (on Yāj. I. 52 ) relies upon three Vedic passages only in propounding the theory of sapinda relationship viz. "indeed the mau bimself is born from himself (as son, Ait. Br. 33. 1)'; 'thou art born again (or reproduced ) in the offspring' (Tai. Br. 1.5.5) and 'this body is made of six kośas ( sheaths ); three are derived from the father, three from the mother ; bones, musoles and marrow from the mother'( Garbhopaniṣad). These passages at the most say that particles of the bodies of the parents continue in their offspring; but they do not say anything about the meaning of sepinda or the limits of the Eapiṇda relationship for marriage or in heritance. Even in the Rg. the words jñāti and bandbu' which occur in the dharmasūtras (e. g. Ap. Dh. S. I. 3.10. 3, I. 5. 11 17. and Gaut. II. 44, IV. 3 and 5, VI. 3) frequently occur (vide Rg. VII. 55. 5 and X. 85. 28 for jñāti and Rg. I. 113, 2, V. 73. 4, VII. 72. 2, VII. 67. 9 for bandhu). All that we can say is that both meanings of sapiṇda were implicit in the word pinda from the earliest times and that the sūtra writers were conscious of both meanings. 

As to the grounds on which marriages between near sapindas were prohibited various theories have been advanced by antbropologists. Vide Westermarck in his ‘History of Human marriage'( ed. of 1921, vol. II. pp. 71-81 ) and Rivers on Marriage of cousins in India' in J. R. A. S. for 1907 pp. 611-640. Some think that the prohibition was due to the abhorrence which men in the primitive times felt for incest. To me it appears more probable that in India at least the prohibition was due to two causes; firstly, the observed fact that, if near relatives marry, their defects are transmitted with aggravation to their offspring and secondly the fear that, if marriages between near relatives by blood were allowed, there may be clandestine love affairs and consequent loss of morals and it would be difficult to secure husbands for girls who would

The Par. M. I. part %, p. 59 expressly says that only such a girl who is not & sapinda of the bridegroom within the prohi. bited degrees on any of the two theories of sāpindya (viz. by connection with particles of the body or with the balls of rice ) is eligible for marriage. 

The question what support Vedic Literature lends to the two interpretations of the word sapiṇda may now be briefly discussed here. 

The word pinda ocours "117 in the Rgveda (1. 162. 19 ) and the Tai. 8. IV, 6, 9, 3 where it seems to mean's part of the body of the sacrificial animal thrown into fire as an offering'. Here it is clear that the word pinda is not used in the sense of 'ball of rice'. But in the Tai, S. II, 3.8.2 and in the Sat, Br. II. 4. 2. 24 the word pinda meang 'ball of rice' offered to the Manes. The Nirukta III. 4 and 5 twice employs the words 'pindadānāya' (for offering balls of rice). But the word sapiṇda bardly ever occurs in the Vedic literature and we have no means of judging in what sense it was used in the Vedic literature. In the dharmasūtras the word sapinda occurs frequently and the dharmasūtras show a close connection between offering pinda and the taking of inheritance ( vide Gaut. 14. 13, 28. 21, Ap. Db. S. II. 6. 14. 2, Vasistha IV. 16-18, Vispu Dh, S. 15. 40). 

It was shown above (pp. 436-37 ) that some sages prohibit marriage with a sagotra girl while others prohibit it with a sapravara girl. A number of sages and works like Viṣṇu Dh. S. 24. 9, Yāj. I. 53, Nārada (stripursa, verge 7) require that the girl to be married must not be a sagotra nor & sapravara. Therefore it is necessary to understand the meaning of gotra and pravara. A detailed treatment of the topics of gotra and pravara would extend to a large treatise. Only & few salient points oan be gone into here. The subject of gotra and pravara in the Vedic Literature has been treated at length by me in the J. B. B. R. A. 8. (New series vol. II. for 1935 ). Only the conclusions there drawn will be set out here.

Marriage-meaning of golra 

479 

The word gotra in the Rg. means 'cow-stable' or 'berd of Cows' in a few passages (I. 51.3, II. 17. 1, III. 39. 4, III. 43, 7, IX. 86.23, X. 48.2, X. 120.8). By a natural metaphor 'gotra' was applied to a cloud (in which waters are pent up as cows in a Cow-stable) or to a cloud demon and also to a mountain range or peak which conceals water-yielding clouds. Vide Rg. II. 23. 3 (where. Bșhaspati's car is styled 'gotrabhid'), Rg. X. 103.7(=Tai. S. IV. 6. 4.2, Atharva-yed& V, 2. 8. and Vaj. S. 17. 39), Rg. VI. 17. %. X. 103. 6. In some of these verses it is possible to take 'gotra' in the sense of 'fort'. In some cases 'gotra' probably means only " assemblage' (samūba) 0. g. Rg. II. 23. 18, VI. 65. 5. From this last senso of 'assemblage' the transi tion to the meaning of a group of persons' is both easy and quick. There is no positive instance of the word 'gotra' being unchallengeably used in the sense 'descendants of a common patriarchal ancestor' in the Rgveda; but the concep tion underlying the idea of gotra was, it is plain, quite familiar even in the age of the Rgveda. In the Atharvaveda V. 21. 31118 the word 'visvagotryaḥ'( belonging to all families) occurs. Here the word 'gotra' clearly means a group of mon connected together' (by blood). The Kausika sātra IV. % quotes & mantra in which gotra undoubtedly means 'a group of persons'. 

Several passages of the Tai. S. show that descendants of great sages were called after those sages. In Tai. S. I. 8. 18. 1 it is said 'the Hotr is & Bbārgava' ( descendant of Bhfgu ). The commentator explains that this is so only in the Rajasuya. It is quite possible that in those days descent was traced through teacher and pupil as well as through father and son. But there being a very few occupations only it is most probable that the son 

generally learnt from his father the lore of the latter. In Tai. S. VII. 1. 9. 1 we read therefore one does not find (or know) two Jāmadagniyas (in succession) who are poor (or grey haired )'. From this it is clear that in the times of the Tai. S. Jamadagni was regarded as a very ancient sage, that several generations of Jamadagni's descendants had passed away by that time, that they were all known as Jāmadagnyas (or-gniyas) and that no two descendants were found to be poor (or grey. haired ) in succession.

In numerous mantras of the Rgveda the descendants of well-known sages are denoted by the plural form of the names of those sages. In Rg. X. 66. 14 we read the Vasiṣtbas have raised their voices like their father'. In Rg. VI. 35. 5 the Bharad. vājas are referred to as Angirases. According to Aśv. Srauta sūtra Bharadvāja is a gotra falling under the Angirogana. In the Brāhmaṇa Literature there are ample indications that priestly families had come to be formed into several groups named after their (real or supposed) founders and that such families differed in details of worship according to the group they belonged to. The Tai. Br. (1. 1. 4) prescribes that the consecration (adhāna ) of the sacred Vedic-fires is to be performed for Bbṭgus or Angirases with the mantra 'bhrgūṇām (or angi rasām) tvādevānām vratapate vratena-dadhāmi,' that for other brāhmaṇas with the words 'ādityānām tvā devānām vratapate' &o. The Tai, Br, II. 2. 3 speaks of the 'Angirasi prajā' (people of the Angiras group). The Tāpdys Brāhmaṇa "119 prescribes that the camasa (oup) made of udumbara was to be given as dakṣiṇā to a Bagotra brahmana.' The Kausitaki Br. 1120 ( 25. 15 ) says that one who has performed the Viśvajit sacrifice (in which everytbing that the sacrificer owned was gifted away ) should stay for a year with a brāhmaṇa of the same gotra. The Ait. Br. (30.7) contains the story of Aitasa and his son Abhyagni and it is stated that the Aitaśāyanas Abhyagnis are the most sinful of the Aurvas. In the Kauṣitaki Br. where the same story occurs it is said that the Aitaśāyanas became lowest among Bhrgus, as they were cursed by their father, According to Baudhāyanaśrauta-sutra the Aitaśāyanas are a sub-section of Burgugana. Sunaḥsepa, when he was accepted as a son by Viśvāmitra, came to be called Devarāta and the Ait. Br. (33.5) says that the Kāpileyas and Babhravas were affiliated to Devarāta. According to Baud. srauta-sūtra Devarata and Babhru are sub-sections of Visvāmitra gotra. Sunaḥsepa is said to have been an Angirasa by birth (Ait. Br. 33,5).1121 So this makes it clear that gotra relationebip was by birth in the times of the Ait. Br. (and not from teacher to pupil). In the Upaniṣads the søges when expounding the knowledge of brahma

Marriage-meaning of gotra

addressed their pupils by the gotra names e. g. by the Bhāra dvija, Gārgya, Aśvelayana, Bhārgava and Katyāyana gotras in Praśna I. 1, Vaiyāghrapadya and Gautama in Chandogya V. 14. 1 and V. 16. 1; Gautama and Bharadvāja, Visvāmitra and Jamadagni, Vasistha and Kaśyapa in Bṛ. Up. II. 2. 4. All this shows that the system of gotras with several sub-sections was well established in the times of the Brāhmaṇas and the ancient Upaniṣads. But the gotras are in these works referred to in connection with sacrifices or education. There is hardly any distinct reference in these to gotra or sagotra in relation to marriage. In the Lātyāyana-srauta-sūtra 1128 VIII. 2. 8 and 10 it is prescribed that one who has given away everything in the Viśvajit sacrifice should stay three nights with niṣadas and may partake of their junglo diet and then again three nights with 'jana' and then the sūtra gives several views about the meaning of 'jana' one of which, that of Dhānañjapya, is that 

jana' means a person with whom (i. e, with whose daughter) marriage is possible while one who is sagotra is called ' samāna jana'. This clearly proves that long before the Latyāyana. srautasūtra marriage with a sagotra had been forbidden. Besides several of the gļhya and dharma sūtras prohibit marriage with a sagotra girl. It is impossible to hold that this was a new conception that arose only about the time of these sūtras. Therefore, it must be supposed that prohibition as to sameness of gotra in marriage had its origin long before the period of the sūtras in the times of the Brāhmaṇa works (if not earlier). 

Gotra was of supreme importance in several fundamental matters and it largely entered into several practices of the ancient Aryans. A few examples may be given here. (1) In marriage sagotra girls were forbidden, vide above pp. 436-37, In the Lājākomna at marriage two offerings were to be made by all except Jāmadagnyas, who had to make three (Aśv. gr. I. 7. 8–9). 

(2) In matters of inheritance the wealth of one dying without issue went to his near sagotras ( Gaut, 28. 19). 

(3) In grāddha the brāhmaṇas to be invited should not belong as far as possible to the same gotra as the person invi. ting ( Ap. Db. S. II. 7. 17. 4, Gaut. 15. 20).

(4) In pārvana athalipaka and other pūkayajñas, all were to out off oblations from the middle and fore-half of the havis, but for Jāmadagnyas ( who are pañcāvaltins ) they were to be cut off from the middle, the fore-part and the hind part (vide Āśv. gr. I. 10. 18-19 ). 118% 

(5) In offering water to a preta ( a person recently dead) his gotra and name were to be repeated ( Aśv. gr. IV. 4. 10). 

(6) In the caula ceremony tufts of hair were to be left in accordance with the gotra and practice of the family (Khadira gp. II. 3. 30). 

(7) At the time of performing one's daily samdhya prayer, one has to repeat even in modern times one's gotra and prayara, the Vedaśākhā and sūtra which one studies. 

As regards srauta sacrificea a few interesting examples may be given. Jaimini establishes that sattras ( sacrificial sessions extending over 12 days and more ) could be performed only by brāhmaṇas and that among brāhmaṇas the Bhrgus, Sunakas and Vasiṣthas are not entitled to perform them (VI. 6. 24-26). Those of the Atri, Vadbryaśva, Vasiṣtha, Vaisya ( Vainya?), Saunaka, Kapya, Kaśyapa and Samkfti gotras took Nārasamsa as the second prayāja, while others took Tanūnapāt as the second ( vide Sabara on Jaimini VI. 6. 1). 

The conception of pravara is closely interwoven with that of gotra from very ancient times. The two bave to be studied together. "Pravara' literally means 'choosing' or ' invoking (prarthana ).124 As Agni was invoked to carry the offerings of a sacrificer to the gods by taking the names of the illustrious rois ( his remote ancestors ) who in former times had invoked Agni, the word pravara came to denote one or more illustrious rṣis, ancestors of a sacrificer. A synonym of prayara is ārṣeya or ārga (as in Yaj. I. 52). Pravara entered into several domestic ceremonies and practices according to the grhya and dharma gūtras. For example: 

(1) a bride was to be chosen whose father's pravara was not the same as that of the bridegroom's father. Vide

Marriage-golra and pravara

(2) In upanayana the girdle (mekhala) was to have one, three or five knots according to the number of rṣis constituting the boy's pravara.(vide San. gs. II. 2 ). 

(3) In Caula the tufts of hair to be left on the head depended on the number of sages constituting the pravard of the boy's family (Ap. gr. 16. 6). 

The mass of material on gotra and pravara in the sūtras, the purāṇas and digests is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is almost an impossible task to reduce it to order and ooherence. The learned author of the Pravara-madjart (which is the leading work on the subject) wrote in despair 'Here, in the parts of sūtras that have been quoted there is a great diver gence in the order (of the names of pruvaras) of the texts of the several sūtrakāras, this being specially so in the text of Aśvalāyana (srauta )-sūtra. Thus, though divergence is clearly established, yet following the order of the texts of the majority of writers such as Baudbāyana, Āpastamba and Katyāyana we shall declare (the rules ) about marriage or no marriage', 1385 

We have first to understand what gotra in the sūtras and digests means and how it is inter-related to pravara. Among the sūtras that treat of gotra and pravara the srauta sūtras of Aśvalāyana (Uttaraṣatka VI, kbandas 10-15), Apastamba (24th praśna) and Baudhāyana (B. I. ed. vol. III pravaradhyaya at end) are the most important. The Pravaramañjarl (p.5) has a verse to the effect that Baudbāyana's pravarādhyāya is the best on the subjeot. 

The Srautasūtra of Satyāṣadha Hiranyakegi (21st praśna) has a section on this subject, which is the same as Āpastam. basrauta with a few omissions and variations. The Baudha. yanaśrauta-sūtra says 1128 "Viśvāmitro, Jamadagni, Bharad vāja, Gautama, Atri, Vasiṣtha and Kaśyapa are the seven sages and Agastya is the eighth; the progeny of these eight sages is declared to be gotra'. These seven bages are probably derived from what is stated in the Bļ. Up. II. 2. 3-4 (=Sate Bṛ.

XIV. 5, 2. 6 ) where these very seven sages are enumerated as those intended in the sloka 'srvāg-bilascamasa "27 &c. quoted there. The same work ( Baud. srauta ) states that there are thousands, tens of thousands and arbudas (millions of millions ) of gotras, but the pravards are only 49. Besides the sūtra works, some purāṇas like the Matsya (chap. 195–202), the Vāyu (chap. 88 and 99, Ānan. ed.), Skanda III.2 (Dharmāranya kapda ) contain elaborate enumerations of gotras and pravaras. The Mahābhārata sets out at length the subdivisions (such as Madhuc. chandas, Devarāta ) of Viśvāmitragotra in Anuśāsa naparva 4. 49-59. Digests like the Smṛtyartbasāra (pp. 14-17 ), the Sam. Pr. (pp. 591-680), the Sam. K. (pp. 637-692), the Nirnaya sindhu, the Dharmasindhu, the Bāļambhatti contain a vast material on this topic. Tbere are also special works like the Pravaramañjarl on this topic. The general conception about gotra is that it denotes all persons who trace descent in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor. When & person says ' I am Jamadagni-gotra' he means that he traces bis descent from the ancient sage Jamadagni by unbroken male descent. As stated by Baud. cited above, from very ancient times these male founders were supposed to be eight. This enumeration of eight primary gotras seems to have been known to Pāṇini. Patanjali says 'there were eighty thousand sages who observed celibacy. The accepted opinion is that the spread of progeny was due to eight sages includ ing Agastya. The offspring ( apatya ) of these eight are gotras and others than these are called gotrāvayava', 1128 Pāçini

defines gotra for grammatical purposes as 'apatyam pautra prabhști gotram' (IV.1. 162), which means the word golra denotes (in my work on grammar) the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son'. For example, the son of Garga would be called Gārgi, but the grandson would be called Gārgyaḥ and the plural Gargāḥ would denote all descendants of Garga (downwards from Garga's grand-son). But this definition is a technical one in grainiar and is meant to indicate how derived (taddhita ) words are to be formed by means of termina tions. Even Pāṇini makes use of this technical sense only in the apatyādhikāra, but elsewhere in his work he uses the word gotra in the popular sense as comprehending all descendants of & common male ancestor. Vide the Kāsikā on Pāṇini II. 4. 63, IV. 2. 39 and IV, 3. 80. The Sam. Pr. (pp. 591-592) lucidly uxplains 1128 this. That a man belongs to a particular gotra is known by him only from tradition, from his father and other elders or from people about him, just as he knows that he is a brābmapa from the same source 1130. Medhātithi on Manu III. 5. 194 has a very lucid and interesting discussion on this topic. His argument is: just as, though all persons are men, some are called brāhmaṇas, 80 among brāhmaṇas certain persons are known by immemorial usage (or convention) as belonging to certain gotras like Vasistha and the sūtra-kāras lay down that a certain gotra has certain pravaras; so the word gotra is applied to Vasiṣtha and other Eages by rūdhi (by convention or long-standing usage). It cannot be supposed that a person called Parāsara was born at & certain time and then his descendants came to be called Parāsaras. In that case the Veda would not be anādi (beginningless), as it is sup posed to be, since it mentions Parāāgra, Vasistha &o. So gotra is anādi like the brābmaṇa caste and the Veda. The word is also secondarily used to denote 8 person, who is very illustrious on account of his learning, wealth, valour or generosity,

who thereby gives a name to his descendants and then becomes the founder of the family. This is laukika gotra. But this is not the meaning of gotras which brāhmaṇas have. The secondary meaning may apply to the word gotra when used in the case of ksatriyas'.1131 The Mit. on Yāj. I. 53 says 'gotra is that which is known from tradition handed down in the family.''** Eao gotra is associated with one, two, three or five sages (but never four or more than five ) that constitute the pravara of that gotra. "138 The gotras are arranged in groups, e. g. there are according to the Āśvaldyana-srauta-sūtra four sub divisions of the Vasiṣtha gana, viz. Upamanyu, Parasara, Kundina and Vasiṣtha (other than the first three ). Each of these four again has numerous sub-sections, each being called gotra. So the arrangement is first into ganas, then into pakṣas, then into individual gotras. The first has survived in the Bhṛgu and Angirasa gane. According to Baud. the principal eight gotras were divided into pakṣas. The pravara of Upamanyu is Vasiṣtha, Bharadvasu, Indrapramada; the pravara of the Parisara gotra is Vasiṣtha, Śaktya, Pārāśarya; the pravard of the Kundina gotra is Vasiṣtha, Maitrāvaruṇa, Kauṇdinya and the pravara of Vasisthas other than these three is simply Vasistha. It is therefore that some define pravara as 'the group of sages that distinguishes the founder (lit. the starter) of one gotra from another'. 1184 

Though the word pravara does not occur in the Rgveda, the word 'ārṣeya' ocours therein and the system of pravara goes back almost to the Rgveda. Rg. IX. 97. 51 has thereby may we acquire wealth and ārṣeya resembling Jamadagni's.' Sometimes the idea of invoking Agni is conveyed without using

Ch. Ix1 Meaning of ārṣeya or pravara 

the word pravara or ārṣeya. In Rg. VIII. 102. 4 1186 it is said * I invoke Agni just as Aurva, Bbṛgu and Apnavāna did.' It is remarkable that these are three of the five pravara sages of the Vatsa-Bhrgus according to Baud. (3). Rg. I. 45. 3 has'o Jatavedas (Agoi), give beed to the summons of Praskanya, as in the caso of Priyamedha, Atri, Virūpa and Angiras.'1136 In Rg. VII. 18.21 it is said they who from house to house gladdened thee, being desirous of thee, viz. Parāśara, Satayātu and Vasiṣtha, will not forget the friendship of a liberal patron (like thee)'. 1137 It deserves to be noted that this mantra mentions Parāśara (wbo in later mythology is the grandson of Vasiṣtha and son of Sakti), Satayātu (who is Sakti according to Sāyaṇa ), and Vasiṣtha. Parāsara, Sakti and Vasiṣtha constitute the prapara of Parāsar& gotra (aocording to A$v. and Baud). In the Atharvaveda (XI. 1.16, XI. 1.25,26, 32, 33, 35, XII. 4. 2 and 12, XVI. 8.12-13) drseya means' descendants of sages or those who are related to sages'. In the Tai. 8. both ārṣeya and pravara occur in the sense of the sātras. In the Tai. S. II. 5. 8.7 ( which refers to the recita tion of the Sāmidbeni verses) we road "he says 'oboose (or invoke) ye the fire called havyavāhuna'; he chooses him ( the fire ) of the gods; be chooses the ārṣeya; in so doing he does not depart from the relationship ( by blood) and doing 50 serves for conti nuity. He chooses the later ones beginning from the remoter ones". In this passage 'ārgeyam' appears to be used in the sense of one or more illustrious ancestors of the sacrificer' and reference is made to one of the two modes of mentioning the sages constituting the pravara. 'Arṣeya' may also be taken here 88 an adjective (qualifying Agni), the meaning being 'ho invokes Agni by the names of the illustrious ancestor sages of the yajamāna'.

In the other mode the affix 'vat' is used after the name of each pravara sage and the remotest one is mentioned last (e. 8. Jamadagnivat, Urvavat, Apnavanavat, Cyavanavat, Bhrguvat). This mode is employed by the adhonryu when he chooses the Hotṛ priest. 1188 The Tai. S. IL 5. 11. 9 appears to refer to one ( i. e. 2nd ) mode. The Kauṣitaki brāhmaṇa explains the purpose of taking the names of ancestors * as the gods do not partake of the offering of him who has no list of ( illustrious ) ancestors, therefore be pro nounces the arṣeya of the saorificer.' The Ait. Br. ( 34.7 ) has an interesting passage on pravara. When a brāhmaṇa is initiated for a sacrifice, that fact is announced in these words 

a brāhmaṇa has been initiated for a sacrifice. How is the initiation of the kṣatriya to be announoed? The reply of the Ait. Br. is * even in the case of the ksatriya the announcement is to be in the same form (viz. a brāhmana has been initiated); but with the prayara of the family priest. Therefore they ehould proclaim the kṣatriya's initiation as a sacrificer with the ārṣeya of his family priest and should invoke Agni with the pravars of his family priest. 1138 The Aśv. Sr. (Uttara patka VI. 15. 4-5) and Baud. Sr. ( pravarapraśna 54 ) say that in the case of kṣatriyas and vaisyas the pravara of their purohita was to be employed or the pravara · Mānava-Aila Paurūravaga' or simply · Manuyat.' The origin of that rule is to be found in the above passage of the Ait. Br. There is another similar passage in the Ait. Br. (35.5). The Sat. Br.

The Mahabharata says that the origioal gotras were only four viz Angiras, Kaśyapa, Vasistha, Bhrgu. 1141 The verses are rather abruptly introduced in the epic and there is nothing to show on what this statement was based and it appears that it is due to the imagination of the writer. Baud. as shown above states that the original gotras are eight. But it is remarkable that Bhrgu and Angiras (whose divisions and sub-divisions are many) are not included by him in these eight. Therefore, it appears that even Baudhāyana is not correctly stating the number of original gotras. Gautama and Bharadvāja are stated to be two out of the original eight, but both of them instead of being separately dealt with are grouped under the comprehensive Angirasagana.So even Baud. is not to be implicitly followed. The Bālambhatti mentions eighteen principal gotras (eight as in Baud. plus ten more some of which are names of mythicai kings "148). Baud, himself says that there are millions of gotras and in the Baud. Pravarādhyāya there are over 500 names of gotra and pravara sages; while the Pravaramañjari quotes a verse that 'there are three crores of them "143 and so the gotra system is difficult to comprehend', and it mentions about 5000 gotras. Therefore, as the Smṛtyarthasāra says the nibandhas endeavour to place the innumerable gotras under groups and distribute them among 49 pravaras (mentioned by Baud.) "**. Some idea of these

gotras and their distribution among the prevaras is given below. The appendix under note No. 1144 collects together the 49 pravara groups, 

The Bhṛgugana and the Angirogana are very extensive. The Burgus are of two sorts, Jāmadagnya and non-Jāmadagnya. The Jāmadagnya Bhrgus are again towfold, Vatsas and Bidas (or Vidas); the non-Jāmadagnya Bhṛgus are fivefold viz. Ārṣṭiṣeṇas, Yāskas, Mitrayus, Vainyas and Sunakas (these latter five are called kevala Bhrgus). Under each of these sub-divisions there are many gotras, on the names and number of which the sūtra kāras are not agreed. The pravara of Jāmadagnya Vatsas is con stituted by five gages according to Baud. and by three according to Kātyāyana. The prayura of the Bidas and the Arṣṭiṣeṇas also has five sages. '45 These three (viz. Vatsas, Bidas and Arsṭiṣonas ) are styled pañcāvattin (Baud.5) and they oannot inter-marry (the reason will be explained below). The five non-Jāmadagnya Bhrgus have each of them numerous sub-divisions. These divisions of Bhṛgus are given here according to Baud. Ap. bas only six of them (and not seven as he excludes Bidas from this group). According to Kātyāyana, Bhrgus have twelve sub divisions ( vide Sam, Pr. p. 625 ). 

The Angirogana has three divisions, Gautamas, Bhara dvājas and kevalāngirases ; out of whom Gautamas have seven sub-divisions, Bharadvājas have four (Raukṣāyaṇas, Gargas, Kapis and Kevala-Bharadvājas ), and Kevala-Angirases have six sub-divisions and each of these again is sub-divided into numerous gotras. This is according to Baud. Other sūtrakāras differ as to the subdivisions. Atri ( one of the eight primary gotras ) is subdivided into four (Atris proper, Vādbhūtakas, Gavisthiras, Mudgalas). Visvāmpitra is sub-divided into ten, which are further sub-divided into 7% gotras. Kaśyapas are sub divided into Kaśyapas, Nidhruvas, Rebhas, and Sandilas. Vasiṣtha has four sub-divisions (Vasiṣthas with one pravare only, Kundinas, Upamanyus and Parāśaras ) which are further sub divided into 105 gotras. Agastya has three sub-divisions (Agastyas, Somavābas and Yajñavābas), the first of which is further sub-divided into twenty gotras.

Marriages-sagotra and sapratara 

491 

When it is said that marriage with a sagotra or a sapravara girl is forbidden, each of these is separately an obstacle to marriage. Therefore, a girl, thougb not sapravara, may be yet sagotra and so ineligible for marriage or though not sagotra may yet be sapravara and not eligible. For example, the gotras of Yaska, Vādhūla, Mauna, Mauka are different, yet a marriage beta ween persons belonging to these gotras is not possible, because the pravara of all these is the same, viz. 'Bhārgava-Vaitahavya-Sāve tasa-iti'.!!48 So also though the gotras Saṁksti, Putimāṣa, Tandi, Sambu and Samgava are different, there can be no marriage bet ween them as the prevara is the same, viz. 'Angirasa, Gaurivita, Samkftya' (aco. to Asy, Srauta). When it is said that samāna pravaras cannot marry, sameness may be due to only one sage being the same in the pravaras of two gotras or there may be two or three or more sages that are common. The general rule is that if even one eage is the same!147 in the pravaras of two different gotras, then they are s&pravara, except in the case of the Bbṛgu group and the group of Angirases. In these two latter unless there are at least three sages common ( when the pravara is constituted by five sages) or at least two sages are common ( when pravara consiats of only three sages ), there is no Bapravaratva and no bar to marriage. It will be noticed that among the five pravara sages of the Vatgas, Bidas and Ārsti ṣenas quoted above there are three sages that are common and so they cannot inter-marry. 

Though the vast majority of gotras have three pravara sages, a few have only one pravara sage or two sages or five. Those who have only one sage are Mitrayus (pravāra Vādhrya Śya according to Aśv.), the Vasiṣthas (other than Kundina, Parāśara and Upamanyu) have only one pravara Vāsiṣtha, the Sunakas have one pravara Grtsamada (according to Aśv.) or Saunaka or Gārtsamada (according to Baud. 9); the Agastis have one pravara Agastya ( according to Ap. Sr. 24. 10.9); Āśv. optionally allows three pravaras to Mitrayus (Bbārgava Daivodāsa-Vādhryasya) and to Sunakas (viz. Bhārgava

Śaunahotra-Gārtsamada) and Ap. also allows to Agastis three pravaras ( Viz. Agastya-Dārdbacyuta-Aidmavāba-iti). Accord ing to Āp, and the purāṇas, Dhāpayantas have two pravaras (Vaiśvāmitra-Paurana-iti ), Aṣtakas Lohitas have two ( Vaisvā mitra-Aṣtaka iti), and Sandilas also have two ( Daivala-Asita iti). But he says that according to some the latter have three pravaras also (Kāsypa-Daivala-Asita-iti), while Baudhiyana gives four optional groups of three sages each for Sāndilas (Baud. 43 ). For Vāri-Dhāpayantas Aśv. prescribes three only (Vaiśvāmitra-Devarāta-Paurana ) and also for the Astakas. According to Baud. the Vatsas, Bidas and Ārstiṣeṇas ( among the Bhṛgus ) have five pravara sages; so also among Angirases, the Kaumaṇdas, Dirghatamasas, Raukṣāyaṇas and Gargas huvo five pravara sages, though the last have optionally three also. 

The Ap. śr. 1118 ( 24. 5 6) says the sages to be invoked were to be three and they were to be seers of mantras'. It is therefore that the number of pravara sages is limited; there was no such requirement for a gotra and so gotras multiplied to an unlimited extent. 

There are certain families that are dvigotras (i. e. have two gotras). Aśv. uses the word "dvipravācanaḥ for them ** They are principally three viz. Sauöga-saisiris, Sarkṛtis and Laugākṣis. From a Sunga, & sub-division of Bberadvāja gotra, was born a son to the wife of a Saisiri, & sub-division of Visvā mitra (hy niyoga); the son, therefore, came to be called Saunga Saisiri. Therefore Saunga-Saisiris cannot marry in both Bharadvāja and Viśvāmitra gotras. Their pravaras are given below riso. They have to select one pravara sage from one gotra and two from the other gotra or two from the first and three from the other. A pravara of four sages is not allowed nor of one beyond five. For the other dvigotras, the San. K. (pp. 682 686), Nirpayasindhu p. 300 ff. may be consulted. In the case of the adopted son also, on the analogy of the Saunga-saisiris,

both gotras and the pravaras of both gotras have to be considered and the diotum of Manu (IX. 142) that the son given does not share the gotra and inheritance of the genitive father and the svadha (sraddhas etc.) of the giver ceases', is restricted only to matters of inheritance, śrāddha and the like and does not apply to marriage. 1151 

A few words must be said about the gotra and pravara of kings and other ksatriyas. It appears from the Ait.Br.quoted above (p. 488) that in the case of ksatriyas the pravara of their purohita was employed in religious acts where pravara had to be recited. This leads to the inference that most ksatriyas had forgotten their gotras and prayaras by that time. The Srauta sutras allow 1158 an option to kṣatriyas ( to kings according to Aśv.). 

They may employ the pravard of their purohitas or all ksatriyas may employ the same pravara viz. Manava-Aila-Paurāravasa iti'. Medhātithi on Manu III. 5 states that the distinctions of gotras and pravaras concern primarily brāhmaṇas alone and not ksatriyas and vaisyas and quotes Asv. Sr. (I. 3) in support, The Mit, and other nibandhakāras rely on the first alternative mentioned in the sūtras and say that in marriages of kṣatriyas and vaiśyas the gotras and pravaras of their purohitas should be considered, as they have no specific gotras of their own 1153. This is carrying the doctrine of atideśa (extension) too far or with a vengeance. The Sam. K. (pp.689-690) assigns reasons for this attitude of the Mit, but they are not satisfactory. Ancient literature and epigraphio records show that kings had gotras of their own. In the Mahābhārata it is said that when Yudhisthira

went to the court of Virata in the guise of a brāhmaṇa and was asked by the king to state his gotra he said that he was of the Vaiyāghrapadya gotra ( Virāta-parva 7. 8-12). That this was the gotra of the Pandavas also follows from the fact that in the Bhismatarpaṇa 1154 that is performed on the eighth day of the bright half of Māgha, Bhiṣma's gotra is given as Vaiyā. ghrapāda or-padya and pravara as Sāṁkrti, Jaimini (VI. 6. 12-15) establishes that the Kulāyayajña was to be perform ed jointly by a king and his purohita (and so they could uso different pravaras it appears). The Pallavas of Kanci had Bhāradvāja as their gotra (vide E. 1. vol. I p. 5). The Cāluk yas are often described as 'mānavya-gotra' ( vide E. I. vol. VI. p. 339). In a copper-plate grant of Jayacan. dradeva (dated samvat 1233 i. e. 1176 A. D.) the donee was a kṣatriya described as Rāuta-śrl-Rājyadbaravarman of the Vatsa gotra and of five pravaras viz. Bhargava-Cyavana Apnayāna-Aurva-Jāmadagoya, 1155 In the Garra (Bundelkhand) plate of the Candella king Trailokyavarma of Kālañjara a village is granted to Rāuta Samanta of the Bhāradvāja gotra in recognition of his father's death in battle with the Turuskas (E. I. vol. 16, p. 274 ). 

In many inscriptions and copper-plate grants hundreds of donees with their gotras and pravaras occur and it would be an interesting study to compare the latter with the material derived from the sūtras and nibandbas. For example, vide E. I. vol. 19, pp. 115-117 and 248-250 for about 205 donees and their gotras in the plates of Bhāskaravarman, E. I. vol. 14, p. 202ff (500 donees with gotras in the time of Candradeva Gāhadavāla, samal 1150), E. I. vol. 13 p. 237, E, I. vol. 8 pp. 316-317 ( śake 1346 ), E. I. vol. 9 p. 103 (32 donees with gotras, pravaras, sakhas &o.), E. I. vol. 12 pp. 163-167 ( 120 donees with gotras, Śake 1508 ), Gupta Ins. No. 55 Chammak plate of Pravarasena &c. Even the Buddhists kept the system of gotras ( vide E. I. vol. 10, Lūder's list, No. 158).

Bhalandana-Vatsapra-Manktila'. They could also employ the pravara of their purohitas. The Sam. Pr. (p. 659) says that Bhalandana is the gotra of vaisyas. 

If a person does not know his own gotra and prevara be should take those of his ācārya ( teacher of Veda), according to Ap.157 Though he takes his teacber's gotra, it is only the teacher's daughter that is forbidden to him in marriage and not other girls of the same gotra as the ācārya's. Both Sam, K. and Sam. Pr. (p. 650 ) quote a verse that when one does not know one's gotra one should call oneself of Kāśyapa gotra. This is so when he does not know even his teacher's gotra. The Sın, O. ( śrāddha section p. 481) says that this is so even when one does not know the gotra of one's maternal grand-father (i.e. he should offer pinda with Kāśyapa gotra to his maternal grand-father ). 

The word gotra also came to mean any family name (surname). In the inscriptions we find this usage very often. For example, in the Bannahalli plate of the Kadamba king Krṣnavarma II (E. I. vol. VI, p. 18) a śreṣthin (a merchant) is said to have been of the Tuthiyalla gotra and pravara. The Reddi king (a śūdra ) Allaya Vema of Rajalımundry was said to have been of the Polvola gotra (E. I. vol, XIII. p. 237, of 

śake 1356 ). 

A few interesting matters about pravaras are noted below. It is noteworthy that even as to the same gotra, there is great divergence among the sūtrakāras about the sages constituting the pravara e. g. as to Sāndilyagotro, Āýv, gives two groups of the sages 'Sāndila-Asita-Daivala-iti' or 'Kāśyapa-Asits-Daivala iti', but Ap. states his own view that there are only two sages in the pravara viz. 'Daivala-Asita iti' and that some say they are tbree, Kāśyapa-Daivala-Asita-iti; while Baud. states four groups, 'Kaśyapa-Avatsāra-Daivala-iti, Kāśyapa-Avatsāra Asita-iti; Saṇdila-Asita-Daiyala-iti; Kāøyapa-Avatsāra sāndila iti." No adequate reasons can be given why even at so early an age as the sūtras, not only the order of the names in the pravara, but the very names in the prevara and their number should have varied so much. Baud. 1158 (pravaradhyāya sec, 44 ) notes that

the Laugākṣis (or Laukakṣis) are Vasiṣthas by day and Kaśya pas by night and their pravaras also show this double relation. ship. The Smrtyarthasāra says that this picturesque description of them bas reference to the prayājas and the like i, e. by day they follow the procedure of prayājas peouliar to Vasiṣthas and by night that peculiar to the Kasyapas. 

Among the gotras there are names of mythical kṣatriyas and kings like Vitahavya and Vainya and among the names of pravara sages many legendary kings like Māndhātý, Ambarlṣa, Yuvanāśva, Divodāsa appear. Vitahavya figures even in the Rgveda as closely connected with the Bhrgus (Rg. VI. 15. 2-3). In the Mahābhārata it is narrated that Vitahavya, being a king, attacked Divodāsa, whose son Pratardana pursued Vita havya, whereupon Vitahavya took shelter with Burgu and that when Pratardana asked Bhṛgu whether there was any ksatriya in the hermitage, Bbṛgu replied that there were all brāhmaṇas and that by this Vitabavya became a brāhmaṇa ( Anuśāsana chap 30 ). 

Similarly the pravars of the Haritas is either Angirasa Ambarisa-Yauvanāśva-iti or Māndbātr-Ambarisa-Yauvunāśva iti. These are mythical royal cages. Among 1150 the Bhrgus is & sub-division called Vainya which is further subdivided into Pārthas and Bāṣkalas. The story of Pṛihu who milked the earth is well-known (Droṇa-parva 69 ); he is called 'adirāja' in Anuśāsana 166. 55. The Vāyupurāṇa in several places narrates that some kṣatriyas became the pravaras of brāhmaṇas. Vide chap. 88. 72-79, ( about Viṣṇuvṛddha, 1160 who was descended from Purukutsa, whose son was Trasadasyu ), chap. 88. 6-7, 92. 6, 99. 158-161, 99. 169-170 ( Anan, ed.) for other examples 101. How and why kṣatriya names were adopted as brahmanical pravaras is obscure and difficult to understand. If one may hazard & guess, it is probably due to the fact that the purāṇas retain very ancient traditions of times when there were no water-tight varṇas and that ancient kings were learned in the

Marriage-gotra and pravara

Vedic lore and maintained srauta fires also, became famous as sages in whose name fire was to be invoked to carry offerings to Gods even by brāhmaṇas who came ages after them. 

The connection of gotra and pravara may be stated thus: Gotra is the latest ancestor or one of the latest ancestors of a person by whose name his family has been known for genera tions ; while prevara is constituted by the sage or eages who lived in the remotest past, who were most illustrious and who are generally the ancestors of the gotra sages or in soine cases the remotest ancestor alone. 

It has been seen (pp.437-38) that marriage between parties that are sagotra or sapravara is no marriage and the woman does not become the man's wife. What were the consequences of such a void union? Baud. 1163 (pravaradhyāya 54) says that if a man has intercourse with a sagotra girl he should undergo the penance of oāndrāyana, after that he should not abandon the woman, but should only maintain her as if she were a mother or a sister ; if a child is born it does not incur sin and it should take the gotra of Kaśyapa. Aparārka quotes (p. 80) Sumantu and another smrti to the effect that if a person inadvertently marries a sagotra or samāpa-pravara woman he should give up intercourse with her, should maintain her and undergo cāndrāyaṇa."163 But if he knowingly marries & sagotra or sapravara girl the penance was heavier (viz, that for incest) and if he has intercourse with her or begets a child from her he loses his caste and the child will be a cāndala"164. The rule of Baud, that there would be no blemish and the child will be of Kaśyapa gotra is restrioted to inadvertently marrying such a girl.1165 The Sam. Pr. quotes a verse of. Kātyāyana to the effect that if a marriage is gone

through with a sagotra, the girl may be again given in marriage to another. But the Sarn. Pr. gets rid of that inconvenient text by saying that it does not apply to the present age. So the poor girl for no fault of hers had to pass her whole life in enforced celibacy, being neither an unmarried woman nor a widow.9166 

Questions about the validity of sagotra or sapravara marriages have not yet come before the courts ; but it is likely that in the near future courts will have to deal with such cases. If a marriage takes place under the Special Marriage Act of 1872 ( as amended in 1923 ) no difficulty will arise ; but recently several marriages have been celebrated under the old sastric procedure between persons who are sagotra or saprayara. Upon the strict letter of the dharmaśāstra texts such marriages are absolutely yoid. But it seems that the legislature should intervene and declare sagotra and sapravare marriages valid. Whatever may have been the case thousands of years ago when there were no means of communication and when there were small communities, the prohibition of sagotra relationship bad some plausibility and real feeling of close kinship about it; but now the prohibition has become meaningless. A man from Kashmir may marry & girl from Madras and the parents of both may have the same gotra. Granting for argument that the gotra gage was a common ancestor, one does not know how many generations have intervened between that remote ancestor and the intending spouses and particles of the ancestor's body, if they have survived at all in the intending spouses of the same gotra, must be in the present generation in the most attenuated state. The prohibitions based upon gotra and pravara are said by orthodox people to be prescribed upon unseen (adreta ) grounds and so they argue that they must be held to be absolute and not admitting of any evasion by any one calling himself a Vedic Hindu. One may be permitted to reply to these people that when almost every-body has given up the ancient cult of the śrauta and gļhya fires and when hundreds of other innovations in ancient practices have been accepted without demur, there is hardly any justification for sticking to this one remnant of ancient practices. As a matter of fact many brābmaṇas now do not remember their pravara themselves but have to be told by the priests what their prevara is. Certain probibitions against

Marriage-sagotra relationship 

499 

marriage between near sapiṇda relations may be respected on account of their universal acceptance. Even the Special Marriage Act of 1872 presoribes that there can be no marriage between parties when they trace descent to a common ancestor who is the great-grandfather or great-grandmother (or who is nearer even than these ) of any one of them. 

Sagotra relationship is in one direction wider than sapinda relationship and narrower than it in another so far as marriage is concerned. A man cannot marry the daughter of any sagotra, however distant the sagotra may be. Similarly even an adopted man cannot marry the daughter of a sagotra of his genitive father for two reasons, firstly because, though on adoption be becomes severed from his natural family for inheritance and offering of pinda ( vide Manu IX, 142 ), his other rela tionships with the natural family remain intact; and secondly because Manu (III. 5 ) says that the girl must not be a sagotra of the bridegroom's father and so even if by adoption & man goes into another gotra, it is the father's gotra that is to be considered). Sapiṇda relationship prohibiting marriage extende only to seven or five generations, but prohibitions on the ground of sagotra relationship extend to any number of generations, On the other hand sapiṇdas may be either of the saine gotras i. e, Bagotra) or of a different gotra (i.e. bhinnagotra). Thus up to a certain limit sapiṇdas include both sagotras and bhinnagotras. The latter are called bandhus by the Mit.; they are all cognate relations and have an important place in inheritance. We have seen (p. 436-37) that sagotra marriages were totally forbidden in the sūtras (in the srauta sūtras like Lātyāyana srauta and in grbya and dharma sūtras). A passage of the Sat. Br.( quoted above at p. 461) is relied upon by Professors Macdonell and Keith (Vedic Index vol. I. p. 236 ) for holding that marriages within the third and fourth degrees on both maternal and paternal sides were allowed in the days of the Satapatha and that therefore & man could marry in those days his paternal uncle's daughter, This latter is & startling proposition. The passage in the Sat. Br. is no doubt expressed in general words ('one may be united in the third or fourth generation'). But that passage is geno. rally applicable even if only a marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter or paternal aunt's daughter is meant. The passage does not expressly allow paternal cousins' marriages. The dharma-sūtras prohibit sagotra marriages. Both the learned Profesgors, as most western scholars do, probably hold that 

500 



(Ch. IX 

the Satapatba is not separated from the sūtras by more than a few centuries. If & paternal uncle's daughter had been eligible for marriage in the times of the Satapatha, but became forbidden in the times of tbe sūtras we shall have to suppose that an usage died out from one end of the country to another and an opposite usage became prevalent throughout within a few centuries. The smṛtis are not afraid of stating ancient practices which they themselves do not accept (i. e. niyoga). The smrtis do not say that marriages with paternal uncle's daughters were ever allowed anywhere. So it appears that the Satapatha is not referring to marriage with paternal uncle's daughter, but to marriage with maternal uncle's or paternal aunt's daughter. It must however be pointed out that Aparārka (pp. 15. 63), the Sm. O. (I. p. 12), Par. M. I. part 1 p. 133 and other digests quote a passage from the Brahmapurāṇa 1187 that sagotra and sapiṇda marriages are forbidden in the Kali age. It may be argued with some force that this implies that sagotra marriages once took place. But there are various ways of explaining this. It is possible that in the purāṇa the word gotra is not used in the technioal sense, but only in the sense of family or surname. Among sūdras there is no gotra in the strict sense, but they also do not marry a girl who is believed to be of the same family, though the exact relationships or generations are not known. Besides it has been shown above that if a woman was & putrikā or married in the Gandharva or Āgura form she retained the gotra of her father and the son of the putriki would have the gotra of his maternal grand-father and yet being of a different family bis marriage with the daugther of a sagotra of the maternal grand-father might have taken place in ancient times and was forbidden in the Kali age by the purāṇa. Similarly the implied reference to marriages of sapiṇdas as taking place in former ages has probably marriage with maternal uncle's daughter in view. When in the kalivariya texts it is said these dharmas are deolared to be prohibited by the sages in the Kali age' (vide Vyavahāra-mayūkha p. 242 ), it is not proper to argue that everyone of the practices forbidden in the kali age was valid in former ages. All that is meant seems to be that most of them were allowed in former ages and these along with others enumerated are not to be practised in the Kali age, just

Prohibitions about Marriage 

501 

as when in a crowd many have umbrellas and a few have not, & speaker still says with reference to the whole crowd 'chatriṇo gacchanti' (here go persons with umbrellas ). 

There are certain other prohibitions about marriage. The Smrtimuktāphala 1168 quotes a verse of Hārlta that one should not give one's daughter in exchange to another's son and receive that other's daughter in marriage for one's son, one should not give two daughters to the same man (at the same time), nor should one give one's two daughters to two persons who are brothers. But these dicta will now certainly be held as merely recommendatory. Besides there is no objection in India in modern times to marrying the deceased wife's sister, though even in England the deceased wife's sister could not be married until 1907 ( when the Deceased Wife's Sister's Marriage Act, 1907, Edw. 7 chap. 47 legalised such marriages). 

The next question is as to who have power to arrange for the marriage of a girl and to give her away. The Viṣṇu Dh. S. (24. 38-39) specifies the order of persons who are entitled to exercise this right of guardianship in marriage 'the father, the paternal grand-father, a brother, a kingman, & maternal grand father and the mother are the persons, by whom the girl may be given away in marriage. In the absence of the preceding one (the right) devolves upon the next in order, in case be is able'. Yāj. (I. 63-64) gives a slightly different order viz. he omits the maternal grand-father and adds that the right can be exercised only when the guardian is not affected by lunacy and similar defects and that in the absence of these the girl should perform svayamvara (i. e. choose a husband herself).

(Ch. IX 

(stripursa verges 20-22) gives the order as father, brother (with father's consent), paternal grand-father, maternal unole, agnates, cognates, mother (if sound in inind and body), then distant relations, then the maiden may perform svayamvara with the king's permission. To give away a girl in marriage was not only a right but was rather & beavy responsibility, as ( Yāj. 1. 64) and others declare that if a girl is not got married by the guardian at the proper time the latter inours the sin of the murder of an embryo. The practice of syayamvara is well known from the Rāmāyaṇa and the Mahābhārata, but it was confined mostly to the princely families. Manu (IX. 90–91) required a girl to wait for three years after she became marriageable before ble could choose her husband herself. But Viṣṇu Dh. S. 24. 40 says that a girl should wait only for three monthly periods after sbe attains puberty and that after that period sbe has full power to dispose of herself in marriage as she thinks best. 

There are no rules in the smṛtis as to who is to arrange the marriage of a male, since in ancient times they did not contem plate the marriages of minor males. 

The mother has been put low in the order of guardians probably because of the dependent status assigned to women and because of tbe fact that in the ceremony of kanyādāna she cannot personally engage but has to get it done through some male relative. The courts in modern India, however, have held that the mother is entitled to select a husband for her daughter even when the girl's paternal grand-father is living, though the actual gist may be made by a male. Vide Bai Ramkore v. Jamnadas, I. L. R. 37 Bom. 18, where Yāj. I. 63 is interpreted as only laying down who are to make a gift of the girl and as not intended to take away altogether the mother's right of selecting a bridegroom in favour of even distant relations. Vide also Indi v. Ghania (I. L, R. 1 Lahore 146 ), Jawani v. Mula Ram (I. L. R. 3 Lahore 29, where it was held that, after the father, the mother of a girl has the preferential right to select a bride groom for her and that she is under no obligation to consult the girl's paternal kindred such as a paternal unole ), Ranga. naiki V. Ramanuja I. L. R. 35 Mad. 728, ( where all the authorities are examined). The Dharmasindhu states the important proposition that when the girl performs svayamvara or when the mother is to give away the girl in marriage, the girl or mother should perform the Nāudisraddha and the princi pal samkalpa is to be pronounced by her and the rest of the

Guardians for Marriage

rite is to be performed through a brāhmaṇa.'170 Narada states the general rule that if anything is done by one who is afflicted with lunacy or similar defects, what he does is as if not done, 80 & marriage settled even by the father if he is a lunatio need not be performed. If an unauthorized person (like a maternal uncle) were to give away a girl in marriage though her father is alive and fit, what is the result? The digesta statel 1714 that if the marriage has been completed by the performance of saptapadi, it cannot be set aside merely on the ground of the want of authority in the giver, since marriage rites are the principal matter and the authority to give is & very subsidiary matter, the absence of which cannot affect the principal matter. But before the marriage takes place a person who wants to give away a girl, though persons better qualified exist, can be prevented from doing so. Courts in modern India have followed these rules, relying on the dootrine of 'factum valet quod fieri non debuit' ( what ought not to be done when done is valid) and holding that when once a marriage is duly solemn ized and is otherwise valid, it is not rendered invalid because it was brought about without the consent of the proper guardian for marriage or in contravention of an express order of the court. Vide Khushalchand v. Bai Mani (I. L. R. 11 Bombay 247) and Bai Diwali v. Moti (I. L. R. 22 Bom, 509). 

A few words must be said about the sale of girls in marriage. We read in the Maitrayapiya s. I. 10. 11 she indeed commits falsehood ( or sin ) who being purchased by her husband roams about with other males. 1178 There is another passage of the Veda relied upon along with the above by the pūrvapakṣa (the plausible view-point) in Jaimini (VI. 1. 10-11) which denies that women have & right to

take part in Vedic sacrifices, viz. 'one should give to the daughter's father & hundred (cows ) plus a charioti' Jaimini replies ( VI. 1. 15 ) that the giving of a hundred with a chariot is not for purchasing a bride, but it is only a duty and a hundred must be offered as a present ( whether the girl is beautiful or not)."173 This shows that, even if some girls were purchased for marriage in the times of the Maitrāyaniya S., there was a popular revulsion of sentiment about this practice and the sale of girls was severely condemned by the time of the sūtrakāras. The Ap. Dh, S. ( II. 6. 13. 10-11) also makes interesting remarks on this point 1174 " there is no gift and the incidents of purchase about one's children; in marriage the gift ordained by Veda to be made to the daughter's father in the words ' therefore one should give a hundred ( cows ) besides & chariot to the girl's father and that (gift) should be made to belong to the (married ) couple' is due to the desire ( of the father to give a status to the daughter and her sons ) and is meant as a fulfilment of duty (and not as a sale transaction). The word ' purchase' applied to such a transaction is merely figurative, since the relationship (as busband and wife ) arises (not from the 80 called purchase but) from dharma." Vas. Dh, S. ( I. 36-37) quotes the two passages of the Veda (from Mait. 8. and the other about the gift of one hundred cows ) in support of the Mānuṣa (i. e. Asura) form of marriage. The Nirukta VI. 9 1175 while explaining Rg. I. 109.2 ( O Indra and Agni, I have heard you to be greater donors than a partially fit son-in-law or a brother-in-law') remarks that "the word

Sale of girls in Marriage

bridegroom who is deficient and not endowed with all good qualities." So Yaska implies that in the south girls were sold for substantial sums of money to persons who ( either becauso they were old or wanting in some qualities desirable in a good bridegroom ) were therefore really deficient as bridegrooms. In the Nirukta ( III. 4) while discussing the several views about the obscure verse of the Rgveda IIL 31, 1 ( sāsad-vahnir &o.) one of the reasons assigned for the view that women do not inherit is that gift, sale and abandonment in the case of women exist, but not in the case of mon, to which some reply that these ( gift, sale &o.) can be minde of males also as is seen in the story of Sunaḥsopa ( in the Ait. Br. 33, Tai. S. V. 2, 1, 3, Tai, Br. I. 7. 10.). 

These passages lead to the inference that in ancient times girls were sometimes purchased for marriage, as was the case in many other countries. But gradually public feeling entirely changed and not only was the sale of daughters by the father or brother severely condemned, but even taking of presents by thein was looked down upon. Ap. Dh. 8. has already been quoted above (note 1174). The Baud. Dh. 8. (1. 11. 20-21) 1196 quotes two verses that woman who is purchased with wealth is not declared to be a legally wedded wife (a patni); she is not (to be associated with the husband) in rites for the gods or manes and Kaśyapa declares that she is a dāsi ( slave girl). Those, who, blinded by greed, give their daughters in marriage for a fee (śwka), are sinners, sellers of their own selves and perpetrators of great sin and they fall into hell &c.' In another place Baud. says he who gives his daughter (in marriage) by sale (as a chattel ) sells his merit (puṇya)'. Manu (III. 51, 54-55 ) strikes 1177 a tender note about daughters when he says 'a fatber should not take even the smallest gratuity for his daughter; if he takes a gratuity through greed he becomes the seller of his obild; when relations do not take for themselves wealth given by the bridegroom as gratuity (but hand it over to the girl) there is no sale ( of the girl ); the wealth so taken is for

honouring the maidens and is only taken from the bridegroom out of loving concern for them. Fathers, brothers, husbands and brothers-in-law desiring their own welfare should honour women and should give them ornaments'. Manu (IX. 98) further recom monds that even a sūdra should not take a gratuity when giving his daughter (in marriage), since in taking a gratuity he clan destinely sells his daughter'. Yaj. III. 236, Manu XI. 61 include the sale of cbildren among upapātakas. The Mah.. bbārata (Anuśāsana 93. 133 and 94. 3) condemns the taking of a gratuity for giving a girl and Anusāsana ( 45. 18-19) speaks of gāthās of Yama contained in dharma-gāstras 'who ever sells his son for a price, or gives a daughter for the sake of bis own liveli-hood in return for a gratuity, would fall into a most horrible hell called Kālasūtra'. Verse 23 of the same ohapter says 'even & stranger cannot be sold, what of one's own children'. Verse 20 (= Manu III. 53 ) condemns even the Arsa form of marriage as a sale because a pair of cattle is therein taken by the girl's father. In Kerala or Malabar it is believed that the great teacher Samkara laid down 64 ācāras, among which are prohibition of the sale of girls, prohibition of sali &c. Vide I. A. vol. IV, pp. 255-256 and also Atri v. 389 and Ap. (in verse) IX. 25 (ed. by Jivānanda ). This practice, however, persisted till modern times. For example, in an inscription dated about 1425 1178 A. D. from Padaividu (North Arcot District) we find an agreement signed by the representatives of Karnata, Tamil, Telugu and Lāta (South Gujarat ) brāhmaṇas that they would give up taking gold for their daughters and get them married by the simple kanyādāna ( the Brahma form ) and that the father who accepted gold and the bridegroom who paid gold were to be punished by the king and were to be excommunica ted from the brāhmaṇa caste. The Peshwa!19 issued orders (about 1800 A. D.) addressed to the brahmapas of Wai (in the Satara District ) forbidding them to take money for giving their daughters in marriage and prescribing fines for the father

who took money, for the giver and the interinediary who brought about the marriage. Among certain castes and among the sūdras even now money or money's worth is often taken when a daughter is married, but generally the money is meant as & provision for the girl and for defraying the expenses of the girl's father. 

The question of the sale of girls in marriage has been from the remotest ages bound up with the question of the father's power over his children Rg. I. 116, 16.180 and I. 117. 17 refer to the story of Rjrāśva who was deprived of his eye-sight by his father because the former gave a hundred rams to a she-wolf. The verses refer to some natural phenomena under a metapho rical garb and cannot be used for drawing the inference that a father could in law deprive his son of eye-sight at his will. The story of Sunaḥśepa ( Ait. Br. 33 ) shows that in rare cases the father did sell his son. The passage of the Nirukta about the power to sell, to gift away or to abandon daughters has been already cited (p. 505), The Vas. Dh, S. 1181 ( XVII. 30-31) says 'Sunaḥsepa is an example of the son bought' (one of the twelve kinds of sons). The same sūtra (XVII. 36-37) defines the apaviddha kind of son as one, who being cast off by his parents, is accepted (as a son) by another. Manu IX. 171 also defines the 'apaviddha' in the same way. Vas. Dh. 8. (XV. 1-3) propounds the absolute power of the parents over their children in the words 'man pro duced from seed and uterine blood springs from the father and the mother; (therefore, the parents have power to give, to sell or to abandon him; but one should not give nor accept an only son'. Here Vas. states the right of patria potestas several centuries before Justinian, who makes the vain boast (Institutes, Lib. I. Tit. IX. 2) that no other people have a power over their children such as we have over ours'. Manu (VIII. 416) and the Mahābbārata 118€ (Udyoga 33. 64) both state that the wife, the son and the slave are without wealth and that what. ever they acquire belongs to him whose they are. Manu (in V, 152 ) says that'gift (by the father of the bride ) is the source of (the husband's) ownership (over her)'. But gradually the

rigour of the father's power was lessened by other competing considerations such as the ideas that the son was the father bimself born again, and that the son conferred great spiritual benefit on the souls of the father and his ancestors by the balls of rice offered in srāddha. So gradually the father's power over the son becamo restricted. Kautilya (III. 13) gives the inte resting information that mlecchas incur no blame by selling or pledging their children, but an ūrya cannot be reduced to the state of slavery. Yāj. II. 175 and Nārada (dattāpradānika 4) both forbid the gift of one's son or wife. Katyāyana 1183 says that though the father has powers of control over the wife and the son, he has not the power to sell or make a gift of his son. Yāj. (II. 118-119 ) modified the rule about the son's acquisitions also. Manu VIII. 389 prescribes a fine of 600 panas for aban doning one's mother, father, wife or son when they are not sinners. Vide Yāj. II. 237, Viṣpu Dh. S. V, 113-114, Kautilya III. 20 (p. 199) for a similar provision. Manu (VIII. 299–300) restricted & man's power to award corporal punishment for misconduct to his wife, son or slave to striking with a rope or a 

thin piece of bamboo. 

One question discussed by dharmasūtra writers is whether one has ownership over one's wife and children. Io Jaimini 1184 (VI. 7. 1-2) it is decided that in the Viśvajit sacrifice where one is to give away all that one has, one cannot give away one's parents and other relatives as one can make a gift only of what one is master of. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 175 says though one cannot make a gift of one's wife or child to another, one is still owner of them.' The Viramitrodaya 1185 (vyavahāra p. 567) is of the same opinion. On the other hand the Tantraratna (of Pārthasārathimisra ) says that the word gift with reference to the son and the like is used only in a secondary sense viz. that of passing to another the power of control over the son

or the daughter. The Vyavahāramayukha is also of the same opinion. 

Afew words may be said about infanticide. Westermarok in his Origin and Development of Moral Ideas' vol. I. ( 1906 ) pp. 393-413 furnishes an exhaustive account of this practice in ancient and modern times among barbarous and civilised communities from various countries, e. g. in Sparta ( for the purpose of securing strong and healthy fighters ), among the Rajputs ( from family pride and fear of the crushing burden of expenses at inarriage ).1186 He is wrong in saying that in the Vedic times infanticide or exposure of children was practised. Rs. II. 29, 1 1187 is of no use on this point; it says 'cast off from me sin as a woman who secretly gives birth to a child (casts it off).' This is not a reference to infanticide of children born in wedlock, but refers to the exposure of a cbild by an unmarried woman which is clandestinely practised everywbere and as regards which even in England a very lenient attitude is shown as manifested by the passing of the Infanticide Act (12 and 13 Geo. V. Chap. 18). The most important passage on which some European scholars like Zimmer and Delbrūck rely upon for this proposition is Tai. S. VI. 5. 10.3 They go to the avablıṣtha '188 (the final sacrificial bath); they keep aside the sthalis (pots) and take up the vessels for vāyu : therefore they (the people ) keep aside the girl when she is born and lift up (i. e. greet with pride and joy ) the son'. This simply refers to the fact that a daughter was not greeted as much as the son. It has nothing to do with exposure or infanticide. That passage only expresses the sentiment contained in the Ait. Br. 5189 (33.1)

the wife is indeed a friend, the daughter is distress (or humilla. tion ), the son is light in the highest heaven. The Mahabbārata ( Adi. 159. 11 ) in a similar veia says 'the son is one's self, the wife is one's friend, but the daughter is indeed a difficulty. But all the same the Grbyasūtras like Āp. ( 15. 13 ) call upon the father to greet his daughter also with a mantra when he returned from a journey, the differance being that in the case of the son there is kissing of the son's head and muttering of certain mantras in his right ear. Manu (IX. 232) advises the king to award death sentence to him who kills & woman, a child or a brābmana. Manu IX. 130 ( = Anuśāsa na 45. 11) expressly says that just as the con is one's own self, 80 is the daughter like the son; bow can another person take the wealth (of the deceased) when his daughter who is his own self is there to take it'9 Nārada!90 ( dayabhāga v. 50) reasons that both the son and the daughter continue the line of the father and therefore in the absence of the son the daughter suc coeds as heir. Bphaspati exclaims' the daughter is born from the limbs of the parents as much as the son ; when she is alive how can another take her father's estate'? Bāns, who as a great post had unparalleled Bympathy with the emotions and feelings of the average man, makes even the king Prabhakara vardhana say about his daughter what every Indian father has felt for thousands of years' this rule of law laid down by some one vix, that one's own children ( daughtera ) sprung from one's body, fondled on one's knees and whom one would never forsake, are taken away all of a sudden by persons (husbands ) who till then were quite unfamiliar. It is on account of this sorrow that although both (son and daughter ) are one's own children the good feel sorrow when a daughter is born and who offer water in the form of tears to their daughters at the very time of their birth'. A daughter was not greated at birth, not because the father had no love for her, but because

he felt that a daughter meant & source of anxiety all her life to him. It was the great concern felt for a daughter's well-being in life and her character that made the parents anxious that no daughter be born to them. Society expected a very high moral rectitude from women and treated lapses of mon with leniency. This is finely expressed in the Rāmāyana (Uttara-kānda 9.10-11). Ancient literature did not everywhere treat women with scorn and contempt. It has already been shown how bigbly the wife was regarded even in the most ancient days as & man's half. Rg. III. 53. 4 speaks of the wife as a haven of rest (jāyed-asiam), The Chan. Up." looks upon the sight of a woman in & dream as very suspicious and as prognosticating success in religious rites already undertaken. Manu (III. 56 = Anusagana 46.5), though he has said, as will be shown later on, some very hard things about women, was not unmindful of the honour due to them and Aays in a chivalrous spirit where women are honoured there the gods love to reside; where they are not honoured, there all religious acts come to nought.' Maidens were regarded as pure ( vide p. 296 above ) and auspioious. When the king passed through his capital it was customary to greet him with fried grain showered by maidens (Raghuvamsa II.10). The Saunaka-kārika 119 (ms. in Bombay University Library folio 22 b) inoludes a maidon among the eight objects which were auspicious. The Dronaparva (82. 20-22 ) mentions numerous objects wbich Arjuna looked at and touched as auspicious when starting for battle, among wbich well-decked maidens are mentioned. Gobhila-smrti II. 163 saya that one that sees on rising from bed in the morning among others a woman whose husband is living is free from all diffi culties. The Vāmana-purana (14. 35-36) mentions several objects which are auspicious when one is about to leave home, among which figure brābmaṇa maidens. Vide Sm. C. I. p. 168.

words ocour 'the cows are killed on the Agbas and (the bride ) is carried away (from her father's house) on the Phalgunis', The cow was killed in Madhu parka which was offered to the bridegroom on the day of marriage. Or this may be a reference to the giving of cows by the bridegroom to the bride's father (as in the form later called arṣa). So it appears probable that this is a reference to marriage being performed on the day when the moon was in conjunction with the constellation of Agbaa (i. e. Māgha). The two Phalgunis follow immediately after the Maghā nakṣatra. There is an echo of this in the Ap. gp. III. 1-2 which says 'cows are accepted on the Maghas and (the bride) is carried (to the bridegroom's house ) on the Phalgunis'. This means that the marriage.(probably in the ārṣa form) is celebrated on the Maghās and the bride goes from her father's house on the next day after marriage or after one day more. The Asv. gr. ( I. 4. 1) says 1194 that 'in the northward passage of the sun, in the bright half of a month and on an auspicious lunar mansion, caula, upanayana, godāna and marriage are to be performed and tbat according to somo teachers marriage may be celebrated at all times' (not necessarily in northward passage &c). The Ap. gr. (2. 12-13) prescribes that all geasons except the two months of Sisira (i. e. Māgha and Phalguna)and the last of the two months of summer (viz. Aṣāḍha) are fit for marriage and all nakṣatras which are declared to be auspicious (or holy ). Ap. gr. further 1198 adds (3, 3)'a father who desires that his daughter should be dear ( to her husband) should give her in marriage on the Nistyā (ie. Svāti con stellation); thus she becomes dear (to her husband ), she does not return (to her parent's house ); this is a procedure based upon the Brābmana passage.' The Brāhmaṇa passage is Tai. Br. I. 5, 2. The Baud. gr. (I. 1. 18--19) is the same "196 as Āp. gr. about months and adds that the nakṣatras for marriage are Robiṇi, Mrgasirsa, Uttarā Phalguni, Svāti; while Punarvasu,

Auspicious times for Marriage

Tiśya (Puṣya ), Hasta, Śravaṇa and Revati are suitable for other ceremonies of an auspicious character. The Mānava gf. ( I. 7.5 ) says that the nakṣatras Robiṇi, Mrgaśiras, Sravans, Sravistha (Dhaniṣtha) and the Uttarās (i. e. Uttarāṣādbā, Uttarā Phalguni and Uttarā Bhādrapada ) are fit for marriage and for taking the bride from her parent's house and whatever other (nakṣatra ) is deolared to be auspicious. Kāthaka gr. 14. 9-10 and Vārāha gr. 10 are similar. The Rāmāyaṇa 1197 ( Balakanda 72, 13 and 71.24) speaks of marriage being per formed on Uttarā Phalguni, of which Bhaga is the deity. The Mahābhārata also speaks of marriage on a nakṣatra presided over by Bhaga ( Ādiparva 8, 16). The Kausika: sūtra ( 75,2-4) makes an approach to modern practice when it prescribes that marriage should be celebrated after the full moon of Kārtika and up to the full moon of Vaiśākha or one may do as one likes but should avoid the month or half month of Caitra.

Medieval digests introduce many detailed rules derived from astrology which it is not possible to get out here. A few only will be indicated. The Udvāhatattva (p. 124 ) quotes Rājamārtaṇḍa 1194 and Bhuja-balabhima to the effect that all months are auspicious for marriage except Caitra and Pausa and that when a girl is very much grown-up one should not wait for auspicious seasons, but she should be given away on any day when the moon and the zodiacal sign rising at the moment of marriage are favourable, and that one should go into questions of auspioious ayana, montb, day &o. up to only the tenth year of girls. The Samskāraratnamālā (p. 460 ) says that as there is conflict among the diota of sūtra and smști

writers about months one should follow the usage of one's country. One should not celebrate the marriage of the eldest son with the eldest daugter of a man in the month of Jyestha (or on Jyesthā nakṣatra ) nor should one celebrate a marriage in the month of birth or on the day of birth or nakṣatra of birth ( of the eldest son or daughter). Wednesday, Monday, Friday and Thursday are the best days of the week, but the Madana pārijāta says that any day is good if the marriage is celebrated at night. 1200 In marriage the moon must be in a strong position for girls. One should avoid Jupiter being the 4th, 8th or 12th from one's rāśi ( zodiacal sign in which the moon was at the time of birth). The Nirnayasindhu quotes & verse that when the girl has reached puberty, then one should not wait till Jupiter is favourable, but marriage should be performed even when Jupiter is 8th from the zodiacal sign of birth, propitiatory rites however being performed for Jupiter. 1201 Upanayana and marriage cannot be performed when Jupiter is in the zodiacal sign called Leo ( Simba), but this applies only to the tract between the river Godāvari and the Ganges. 1203 From the nakṣatra and zodiacal sign at the time of birth ( in the case of both the girl and the bridegroom) certain astrological calculations were made in eight ways 1203 called kūtas. They were Varna, Vaśya, Nakṣatra, Yoni, Graha (planets governing the twelve rāśis ), Gana, Rasi, and Nādi, each later one of which was more powerful than each preceding one and marks (guna) from 1 to 8 were respectively assigned to each of these if the conditions laid down were satisfied. Two of these viz. gana and nādi are attached great importance even now among brāh manas and other classes also and so they may be illustrated here, though very briefly. The 27 nakṣatras are arranged in three groups of nine each, each group being assigned to Deva. gana, Manusyagana and Rākṣasagana as follows:

If the bride and bridegroom are born on nakṣatras that belong to the same class out of these three groups it is the best thing but if their nakṣatras of birth belong to different groups, then the rules are: it is middling if their nakṣatras belong to the deve group or the human group respeotively, or if the bride groom's nakṣstra being of the devagaña or rākṣasagana, the bride's is of the manuṣyagaṇa, while if the nakṣatre of the bride is of the rākṣaga group and the bridegroom's of the manusya type, then death would result. Similarly if the nakṣatras of the pair respectively belong to the deva aud rakṣaga groups, there would be quarrels and enmity between the two. 

For the purpose of nādi the nakṣatras are divided into three groups of nine each, ādyanādi, madhyanādi and antyanādi, as follows: Adyanādi

If the pakṣatras of the intended pair belong to the same nādi, then that portends death and so there is to be no marriage in such a case. The respective nakṣatras of birth in the case of the two should belong to different nādis.516 





The apxieties of the girls' father did not end here. If after the marriage was settled but before it actually took place any relative in any of the two families died, then the marriage agreement was to be broken off according to some writers, but Saunaka 1204 mercifully states a more sensible and reasonable rule viz, if the father or mother or paternal grand-father or paternal grand-mother or paternal uncle, brother or unmarried sister of the intended bride or bridegroom dies, or the bride groom's first wife or his son from another wife dies, then only it is pratikūla and the marriage should not be performed, but the death of any one else presents no obstacle. 

If before the rites of marriage begin (i. e. before the per formance of nandiśrāddha ), the mother of the bride or of the bride-groom has her monthly illness then the marriage has to be postponed till she becomes pu re (till the fifth day after the illness ), 

Forms of marriage: From the times of the grhy& sūtras, dharmasūtras and smrtis the forms of marriage are said to be eight, viz. Brahma, Prājāpatya, Arṣa, Daiva, Gāndharya, Āsura, Raksasa and Paisaoa ( vide Āśv. gr. I. 6, Gaut. IV, 6-13, Baud. Dh. 8. I. 11, Manu III. 21 = Adi-parya 73. 8-9), Viṣṇu Dh. S. 24.18-19, Yāj. .58, Nārada ( strīpumsa, verses 38-39), Kautilya III. 1, 59th prakarana, Adi-parva 102. 12-15 (they are described but not named); some of these arrange the first four differently, e. g. Aśv. g}. arranges them as Brāhma, Daiva, Prājāpatya and Ārsa, while Viṣṇu arranges them as Brāhma, Daiva, Ārga and Prājāpatya; Aśv. gr. I. 6 places Paisāca before Rākṣasa. The Mānava gr. speaks of only two Brāhma and Saulka (i, e. Asura), probably because these two were the forms most current. Āp. Dh. S. (II. 5. 11. 17-20--II. 5. 12. 1-2) speaks of only six, omitting Prājāpatya and Paiśāca ; while Vas. Dh. 8. I. 28-29 expressly says that there are only six forms of marriage viz. Brāhma, Daiva, Arṣa, Gāndharva, Kṣatra and Mānuṣa ( the last two being the same as Rākṣaga and Asura ). It is impossible for want of space to set out the various definitions of the several forms given by the several authors. There is general agreement on the special characteristics of each and it is sufficient to point out these as given in Manu III. 27-34.

ft of the wound steig delica', 

The gift of a daughter, after decking her (with valuable garments ) and honouring her (with jewels &c.), to & man learned in the Vedas and of good conduct, whom the father of the girl himself invites, is called Brāhma. When the father gives away his daughter after decking her (with ornaments &c.) to a priest, who duly officiates at & sacrifice, during the course of its performance, it is the Daiva form. 1305 When there is & gift of one's daughter, after taking one pair of cattle (& cow and a bull ) or two pairs only as a matter of fulfilling the law (and not as a sale of the girl ), that is named the ārṣa form, The gift of & daughter, after the father has addressed ( the couple with the words 'may both of you perform your religious duties together') and after he has honoured the bride-groom ( with Madhuparka &c.), is declared to constitute the Prājāpatya form. Yāj. I. 60 calls this 'kaya', because in the Brāhmaṇa works 'ka' means ' Prajā pati'. When the girl is given away at the father's will after the bride-groom gives as much wealth ag he can afford to pay to the relatives of the girl and to the girl herself, that is called the Asura form. The union of a girl and the bride-groom by their mutual consent is known as Gāndharva, which springs from the passion of love and has intercourse as its purpose. The forcible abduction of a maiden from her house, while she weeps and cries aloud, after her kinsmen have been slain (or beaten), wounded and their houses or fortresges) are broken open, is called the Rakṣasa form. When a man has intercourse with a girl stealthily while she is asleep or intoxi cated or disordered in mind (or unconscious), that is the Paisāca form, which is the basest and the most sinful of all forms. 

In the first four forms there is the gift of the girl (kanyādāna) by the father or other guardian to the bride-groom. The word *dāna' bere is used in 8 secondary sense (as stated above on p. 504) viz, in the sense of transfer of the father's right of guardia pship and ountrol of the maiden to the husband. All gifts are to be made with water in the case of brāhmaṇas as stated by Manu 

1205. Baud. Dh. I. 11. 5 E HITATATE fa ft F I According to him the girl booomes part of the dakṣinā (fee) for officiating. But in the Vodas and Srauta sūtras a bride is nowhere spoken of as dakpiṇa. Medbātithi on Manu III. 28 is against the idea of the bride being part of the sacrificial fee. Viśvarūpa also says RO; but Apararka p. 89 holds that the girl is givon as fee.

( III. 35 ) and Gaut. V. 16-17. 1206 Similarly in all the four forms where there is kanyādana the girl is to be well dressed and deoked with ornaments. The essence of the brābma form is that the girl is given without receiving anything from the bride-groom, who is invited and honoured by the girl's father. It is called brāhma either because brabma means the holy Veda and this mode being sanctioned by the most ancient texts it is the holiest and best form, or brahma means dharma and being the best of all forms it is called brāhma (vide Smṛtimuk tāphala part I. p. 140). In the ārṣa form & pair of cattle is received from the bride-groom and it is somewhat inferior to the brāhma form. But the pair is given not as a price (i. e. there is no purchase ), but because that is one way of effecting & marriage laid down by the sāstras (vide the passage quoted above at p. 504 . therefore one should give a hundred cows &c' and Āp. Db. S. II. 6.13. 11, which is opposed to Vas. Db. 8. I. 36 ) and the gift is made to show one's regard for the girl (vide Manu III, 53-54). The daiva form is only appropriate to brāhmanas as only 1307 a brāhmaṇa could officiate at & sacrifice. It is so called because the bridegroom is engaged at the time in rites for the gods and it is inferior to the brābma inasmuch as in it there is soine trace of benefit to the father ( that the priest may do his best in the rite for the gods ). Govindasvāmin on Baud. Db. S. says the bride is in this form part of the sacrificial fee'. In all forms of marriage the husband and wife have to perform all religious acts together, as forcibly put by Ap. Dh, S. 1208 ( there is no separation betweon husband and wife, since from the time of taking the band of the wife there is joint perforin ance of all religious actions). But in the Prājāpatya the words used indicate according to the commentators ( vide Sam.

Forms of Marriage

Pr. p. 852 and Haradatta on Gaut. IV. 5) one or more of several things, viz. that the husband will remain a house-holder all his life and will not become a recluse while the wife is living or that he will not marry another wife i. e. it will be a strictly monogamous marriage which is defined in Hyde v. Hyde (1866), P. and M. p. 130 as 'the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others' (p. 133 ), or that he will associate the wife with himself not only in sacrifices but also in works of charity (like building tanks, wells &c.). This form is inferior to brāhma in that the father, as it were, makes a special stipulation with the bride-groom, while in the brābina there is no such special stipulation, but the bride-groom promises that he will not break faith with his wife in the matter of the three puruṣārthas, dharma, artba, kāma. 1208 

In the āsura form there is practically a sale of the girl for money or money's worth and so it is not approved. The arṣa is distinguished from āsura in this that in the latter there is no limit to what is taken from the bride-groom, while in the former a pair of cattle is offered as a matter of form. In the gāndharva there is no gift by the father; on the contrary the father's authority is set at naught by the girl for the time being. Marriage was a sacrament according to ancient sages, and its principal purposes as stated above (pp. 428–29) were the acquisition of merit by the performance of religious duty and of progeny. In the gandharva form the principal object was gratification of carnal desires and so it is held inferior to the first four forms and is disapproved. This kind of marriage is so called because it is prompted by mutual love and the Gandharves were known to be libidinous, as the Tai. S. VI. 1.6.5 (strikāmā vai Gandharvab) and Ait. Br. V. 1 state. In this form at least the girl's feelings are consulted. In the rākṣasa and the paiśāca, there is no gift by the father and both are or may be against the wish of the girl. The forcible carrying of the girl is the essence of the rākṣasa (even if there is no fight because the girl's father takes no retaliatory steps in fear of the abductor's strength). It is called rākṣasa because rākṣasas ( demons) are known from legends to have been addicted to cruel and forceful methods. The paigāca is so called because in it there is action like that of pisācas ( goblins ) that are supposed to act stealthily by night.

It is not to be supposed that when ancient sages held that rākṣaga and paiśāoa were forms of marriage, they legalized marriage by capture or stealth. What they meant was tbat these were the means of securing 1210 wives and that there are not really eight kinds of vivāhas, but rather there are eight ways in which wives may be secured. It is for this reason that Vatsa gays that if a fine girl cannot be secured by any means she may be approached even in private by stealth and married. The sages condemned in no measured terms the paisāca. From the fact that Apastamba and Vasiṣtha both ignore the Paigāca and Prājāpatya it may be inferred that these two bad ceased to be recognised by their time and that the other sages enumerated them only because they appeared in ancient works and for the sake of completeness of treatment. Vasiṣtha ( 17.73 ) expressly repudiates the idea that legal wifehood can arise by forcible seizure of a girl 'if a damsel '211 has been abduoted by force and not wedded with sacred texts she may lawfully be given to another man ( in marriage ); she is just as good as a maiden'. The smrtis out of regard for the future welfare of the girl preferred to blink at the wrong done, but insisted upon the abductor or stealthy seducer performing the rites of homa and saptapadi in order to confer on the girl wronged the status of a legally married wife. But if the wrong-doer was unwilling to do this they recommended that the girl may be given to another in marriage and pronounced very heavy punishments for the abductor or seducer of a girl (vide Manu VIII. 366 and Yāj. II. 287-288). Sir Gooroodas Banerjee 1213 rightly expresses surprise at Macnaughten's saying that fraud was legalised by the Hindu Law in the case of the paiśāca form. Manu VIII. 366 says that if a man bas inter course with a girl of his own caste with her consent, he will have to give a fee to the father if the latter so desires and

Forms of Marriage

Medhātithi 1918 adds that if the father does not desire money the lover will have to pay a fine to the king, that the girl may be given to him or if she has lost her love for bim, she may be given to another and if the lover himself wants to discard her he should be forced to accept her (as a wife), Nārada (strl pussa, verge 72 ) similarly says that if a man has sexual inter course with a maiden who is a consenting party, then there is no offence, but he must marry her after decking her (with ornaments) and treating her with honour. 

The Sm. C. and other digests state that in the gāndharva, asura, rākṣaga and paisāoa homa and saptapadi are necessary and they quote Devala and the Grhyapariṭista in support. The Mahābbārata (Adi. 195, 7) 1814 expressly says that even after svayamvara religious rites had to be performed. Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa VII describes how after the svayamvara of Indu. mati the principal religious rites of madhuparka, homa, going round the fire, pānigrahaṇa took place. Since Aśvalāyana first speaks of eight forms and then prescribes the performance of home and saptapadi, be implies that these are necessary in all forms. 

The smrtis contain several views about the suitability of these eight to various varṇas. All are agreed that the first four, brābma, daiva, ārṣ& and prājāpatya, are the approved forms ( pragasts or dharmya). Vide Gaut. IV. 12, Āp. Dh. S II.5.12. 3, Manu III. 24, Nārada (stripuṁsa, verse 44) &o. Most say that each preceding one out of the first four is superior to each succeeding one and that thus brāhma is the best (vide Ap. Db. 8. II. 5. 12. 4, Baud. Dh. S. I. 11. 11). Almost all are agreed that paiśāca is the worst. Manu III. 23-26 refers to several views. One view is that the first four ( brāhma &o.) are the proper forms for brābmanes ( Baud. Db. 9. I. 11. 10, Manu III. 24). Another view was that the first six (out of the eight i. 8. all except rākṣaga and paigāos ) are allowed to brāhmanas and the last four to kṣatriyas, and the gāndharva, Apura and paisāca to vaisyas and sūdras (Manu III, 23 ). A third view was that prājāpatya, gāndharva and āsura may be resorted to

by all varṇas and paisāca and āsurs should not be resorted to by any one of any varṇa ( Manu IlI. 25 = Anuśāsana 44.9-10), but in another verse (III. 21 ) Manu allows asura to vaisyas and sūdras'214*, Manu mentions the view that the gāndharva and rākṣasa are proper ( dharmya ) for a kṣatriya or a mixture of these two viz. where the girl loves the bride-groom, but ber parents or guardians disapprove or cause obstacles and the lover takes away the girl after a fight with her relations (Manu IIL 26 and Baud. Dh. 8. 1. 11. 13). Baud. Dh.S. 1218 (I. 11, 14-16) recommends āsura and paiśāca to vaisyas and sūdras and assigns the interesting reason for the vaisyas and sūdras do not keep their wives under restraints, they having to do the work of ploughing and waiting upon (the other varṇas)'. Nārada ( strīpumsa, verse 40 ) says that gāndharva is common to all varṇas. The Kāmasūtra (III. 5. 28 ) first speaks of the brāhma as the best ( following the view of the dharmaśāstra writers ) and then, true to its own particular subject, gives its own opinion that gāndharva is the best ( Kāmasutra III. 5. 29-30). 

The gāndharva form was very much in vogue among royal families. In the Sakuntala, 1218 Kālidāsa gives expression to this practice. In the Mahābharata 1917 Krsna says to Arjuna who was in love with Subhadrā that carrying away by force one's lady-love is commended in the case of valiant ksatriyas. In the Sanjan plates of Amoghavarṣa ( dated sake 793 ) it is stated that Indrarāja married the daughter of the Calukya king at Kaira by the rākṣasa form of marriage ( E. I. vol. 18, p. 235 at p. 243 ). Another and a very famous historic example of the raksasa form is the forcible abduction after & most dashing and valiant fight by Pșthvirāja Cohan of the daughter of

The svayaivara very often spoken of in the dharmaśāstras was practically the gāndharva as stated by the commentary Viramitrodaya. 1918 It had several varieties. The simplest forni of svayamvara occurs when, as described by Vas. Dh. S. 17. 67-68, Manu IX. 90, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 1. 13, a girl, who attains puberty and whose father does not find & proper husband for three years, herself seeks her husband (or after three months from puberty according to Gaut. 18. 20, Viṣṇu Db. 8. 25. 40-41 ). Yāj. I. 64 also recommends svayamvara to every girl when there is no parent or other guardian who can find out a worthy husband for her. When a girl chose her own husband as above she had to return all ornaments given to her by her parents or brother and the husband who married her had to pay no sulka ( dowry ) to the father as the latter lost his power over her by not giving her away in time ( vide Gaut. 18. 20 and Manu IX, 92). This simple svayamvara was applicable to girls of all castes. Sāyitri indulged in this kind of syayar vars, when she went about in a chariot to find out a suitable husband for herself. But the svayamvaras described in the two great epics are often most elaborate and spectacular affairs and were confined to royal families. The Adiparya says that kṣatriyas commend svayamvara and resort to it, but they prefer a girl who is carried off after subduing her relatives, Bhiṣma carried off the three daughters of the king of Kāśi and got two of them ( Ambikā and Ambālikā ) married to his ward Vicitrapirya. 1220 The svayamvara of Sitā or Draupadi did not depend upon the will of the bride, but the bride was to be given in marriage to whomsoever showed & certain skill as a warrior. In the case of Damayanti it was & real choice of her husband by her ( Vanaparva 54 ff.) though sbe chose Nala in s vast and splendid assembly of royal suitors. Kālidase also

gives us a fine description of the evayamvara of Indumati in the Raghuvamsa. Bilhana in his Vikramānka-devacarita (canto IX) gives a description of the historio svayamvara of Candralekha ( or Candaladevi ) daughter of the Silābāra prince of Karahāṭa ( modern Karad), when she chose Abavamalla or Vikramānka, the Cālukya king of Kalyāna ( latter balf of 11th century). Such a svayamvara, it appears, was thought to be unsuitable to brāhmaṇas according to the Adiparva. 11 In the Kadambari ( Pārvabhāga, penultimate para ) Pattralekha says that svayamvara is ordained in the Dharmaśāstras. 1337 

The Ap. Dh. S. II. 5. 12. A makes & general statement that the progeny of a couple partakes of the character of the form in which they were married 1228 (i. e. if the marriage is in the best or in an approved form the son is good; if the marriage is in a condemned form, the son bears a low character ). Mapu (III. 39-42 ) expands the same idea by stating that sons born of marriages in the brahma and other three forms are full of spiritual eminence and are endowed with beauty, virtues, wealth, fame and very long life, while sons of marriages of the other four forms are cruel, are liars, haters of the Veda and of dharma. Some sūtras and smrtis state how many generations are rendered holy by a son born in one of the first four forms. For example, Āśv. gr. ( 1. 6) says that a son born of parents married in the brāhma, daiva, prājāpatya or ārsa forms respec tively brings purification to twelve descendants and twelve ancestors on both sides (i. e. his father's and mother's ), to ten descendants and ten ancestors on both sides, to eight descen dants and ascendants on both sides and to seven descendants and ascendants. Manu (III. 37-38 ) and Yaj. ( I. 58-60) put the matter somewhat differently. According to them the son of & brāhma marriage brings purification to ten paternal ancestors, to ten male descendants and to himself ( in all 21 ), of the daiva marriage to seven paternal ancestors and seven male descen dants, of the prājāpatya marriage to six male anoestors, to six male descendants and to himself (in all 13), of the arṣa marriage to three male ancestors and three male descendants.

Forms of Marriage 

525 

(IV. 24-27 ) has similar provisions. Commentators like Viśvarūpa and Medhātithi explain that these verses are not to be taken literally. They merely praise the extreme desirability of the brahma form. Viśvarūpa, however, alternatively proposes that one may accept the texts of the holy sages as literally true, following the dictum of Sabara that there is nothing too heavy (or impossible ) for a holy text. 1224 One may laugh at these texts about the virtues of the several forms of marriage, but they are really intended to emphasize the high importance to the future of the race and to society of noble ideals of marriage, of morals and of a decent and peaceful mode of life. 

The forms of marriage have their roots deep down in the Vedic Literature. Rg. X. 85 gives expression to a marriage in the brāhma form ( there is kanyādāna and so forth). The asura form (by payment of money ) is referred to in Rg. I. 109.2 and Nirukta VI.9 (quoted above in note 1175). The gāndharva form or svayaṁvara is indicated by Rg. X. 27. 12 (quoted above p.439) and Rg. I. 119.5. The story of Syāyāśva narrated in the Bșhad devatā (1.50) in connection with Rg. V.61 makes an approach to the daiva form. It is related in the Bșhad-devatā that Ātreya Arcanānas who officiated as a priest at & sacrifice for king Ratha viti asked for his son Syāvāśva the hand of the king's 

daughter. 

In modern times two forms are in vogue, the brāhma and āsura. In the brabma form it is a gift of the girl pure and simple; in the āsura form it is like the sale of the bride for pecuniary consideration paid to the father or other guardian for his benefit. If this element of pecuniary consideration paid to the guardian.exists, its effects oannot be undone by the form of & gift being gone througb. 1235 The gāndharva form is said to be obsolete now, yet in some cases before the courts it has been held that it is still in vogue. 1226 There can be no gāndharva if the girl is & minor. Further if a widow remarries, that marriage

will be ordinarily regarded as gāndharva, because there will be no gift of a kanya ( as she is a widow ) and because she herself will generally arrange such a marriage. 

Before proceeding to set out in detail the ceremonies of marriage, it would be best to analyse the contents of Rgveda X. 85, which is & marriage hymn redolent of the highest ideal of marriage and conjugal felicity and several verses of which are recited even now in the marriage rites. The hymn refers to a mythical marriage of Sūryā, daughter of Savitr, with Some and the important features of the marriage, though not arranged in a regular sequence in the hymn, are: the two Aśvins went to ask for Sūryā as a bride for Soma 1297 (verses 8-9); Savitr agreed to give her (v.9), the bride-groom was treated with honour, presents were made to him and cows were killed for (or presented to) him; Soina took hold of her hand with the verge (36)' I 1228 take thy Land for prosperity (or love ) so that you may grow to old age with me thy husband; the gods, Bhaga, Aryaman, Savits, the wise Pūṣan have given thee to me for performing the duties of a house-bolder'; the bride is a gift by her father in the presence of gods and the fire ( v. 40-41); the girl passes from the dominion and control of her father and becomes united with her husband (v. 24); the bride is blest as follows: 'may you stay here together, may you not be separated, may you compass all life (long life ), happy in your own house and playing with your sons and grandsons; O Indra / make her endowed with worthy sons and prosperity ; bestow on her ten sons and make her husband the eleventh (male); may you be queen over your father-in-law, mother-in-law, over the husband's brother and sister (vv. 42, 45-46). 1939 Among subordinate items it is noteworthy that Raibhyā was sent along with Sūryā as her friend ( anudeyi) to make her time not hang heavy on her hands

(1.7.1-2) says' various indeed are the observances of ( different ) countries and villages; one should follow those in marriages; what, however, is common ( to all or most ) that we shall declare'. Similarly Āp. gp. (2. 15 ) declares' people should understand from women (and others ) what procedure is (to be observed according to custom)'and the commentator Sudarsanācārya notes that certain rites like the worship of planets, ankurāropaña and the tying of pratigara (the marriage string or ribbon round the wrist ) are usual and are performed with Vedic mantras, while others like Nāgabali, Yakṣabali and the worship of Indrāṇi are performed without Vedic mantras. The Kathakagshya 25.7 allows usages of countries and families to be observed in marriage and the commentators mention several such usages. As the grhy&-sūtra of Asyalāyana contains perhaps the shortest account of marriage rites and as that sutra is probably the most ancient among the grhya sūtras I shall set out below the entire ceremony of marriage from that sūtra Then a few important details from other gshya gūtras will be added and it will be pointed out how in modern times a marriage is celebrated, particularly among higher classes. It must be remembered that there is not only great divergence as to the number of separate ceremonies that constitute the samskāra of marriage, but the sequence of even the most important ceremonies is different in the several sutras and the mantras also are different (though some like Rg. X. 185. 36 are common to all ). It is remarkable that out of the 47 vorges of Rg. X. 85, the Ap. Mantrapātha employs as many as 29 (most of which are quoted in connection with marriage ). The main outlines of the marriage samskāra show & remarkable continuity for several thousand years from the times of the Rgveda down to modern times. 

The Abv. gr. ( I. 7. 3-I. 8.) deals with all the marriage rites as follows †: Having placed to the west of the fire (that is

kindled on the altar as described already ) a mill-stone and to the north-east ( of the fire) a water jar, he should offer sacrifice (with the sruva), while the bride takes bold of him ( touches his right hand ). Standing with his face turned to the west, while the bride is sitting and has her face turned to the east, he should seize only her thumb with the mantra 'I take hold of thy hand for happiness' (Rg. X. 85.36 quoted in note 1228), if he desires that only male children be born to him; he may seize her other fingers if he is desirous of female children; he may seize her hand on the hair side together with the thumb if he be desirous of both (male and female children ). Leading her thrice round the fire and the water jar so that their right sides are turned towards (the fire &o. ) he murmurs 1231 'I am ama (this ), thou art sā (obe ), thou art sā, I am ama; I am heaven, thou art the earth; I am the saman, thou art the ?k. Let us both marry here. Let us beget offspring. Dear to each other, bright, having well disposed minds, may we live for a hundred years!' Each time he leads her round ( the fire ) he makes her tread on the stone with the words )' tread on this stone; be firm like & stone; overcome the enemies; trample down the foes.188% Having first poured clarified butter over her joined hands, the bride's brother or some one who is in the place of brother pours fried grain twice over the bride's joined hands, three times in the case of those whose gotra is Jamadagni( i. e. if the bridegroom is of that gotra ). Then he pours clarified butter over what has been left of the haris (sacrificial material or offering) and over what has been cut off ( separated from the aggregate ). This is the rule about the portions to be out off ( in every case where there is avadann). 1838 With the following verses (recited by the bride-groom)

To god Pūṣan the girls have offered sacrifice, to Agni; may he, god Pūṣan &c. ; with these (the bride ) should sacrifice (the fried grain ) without opening her joined hands, as if they were the spoon called sruc. Without going round the fire the bride sacrifices fried grain a fourth time silently with the neb of the sūrpa (winnowing basket) towards herself. Some1234 lead the bride round each time after fried grain has been poured out, so that the two last oblations do not follow imme diately after each other. Then he loosens her two looks of hair if they are made up ( that is if her hair has been bound round on two sides with two tufts of wool), ( the right one) with the mantra "I release thee from the fetter of Varuna' (Rg. X. 85, 24) and the left one with the following mantra (Rg. X. 85. 25 ). Then he causes her to step forward in a north-eastern direction seven steps with the words 'may you take one step for sap, second step for juice (or vigour), third step for the thriving of wealth, fourth step for comfort, fifth step for offspring, sixth step for seasons, may you be my friend with your seventh step 1 May you be devoted to me; let us have many sops, may they reach old age,1233 Bringing the heads of the two ( bride and bride-groom) together, he ( the ācārya) sprinkles

When this was done the 4th oblation of lājas would not coino immediately after the third oblation of lajas, but after she went round the fire the third timo. The Gobbila gr. II. 1. 14 presoribes that the fried grain to be offored into fire is mixed with tendrils of the saini plant and Kalidasa (in Raghuvamda VIL. 25–26 ) refers to sami and lajas.

their heads with water from the water jar. And the bride should dwell that night in the house of an old brahmaṇa woman whose busband and children are alive. 1236 When she (the bride ) has seen the Pole star, the star Arundhati and the seven sages (the constellation of Ursa Major), let her break her silence and say 'may my husband live and may I secure offspring '.1937 If ( the newly married couple ) have to make & journey ( to their home in another village), let him cause the bride to mount a chariot with the verbe 'may Pūṣan lead theo from here holding thy hand' (Rg. X. 85. 26 ); he should make her ascend into a boat with the hemistitch 'carrying stones (or the river called Aśmanvati) flows; get ready' (Rg. X. 53. 8) and let him make her descend from the boat with the following hemistitoh; if she weeps let him pronounce the verse they weep for the living' (Rg. X. 40. 10). They constantly carry the nuptial fire in front. At pleasing places, trees and cross roads, let him mutter'may no way-layers meet us'( Rg. X. 85. 32). At every dwelling place (on the way) let him look at the onlookers with the mantra 'this newly married bride brings good luck'(Rg. X. 85. 33). He should make her enter his house with the verse' here may happiness increase unto you through offspring '(Rg. X. 85.27). Having kindled with fuel sticks the nuptial fire and having spread to the west of it & bull's bide with the neck turned towards the east and the hair outside he makes oblations, while she (the bride ) is sitting (on that hide ) and takes hold of him, with the four verses (one oblation with each verse ) may Prajāpati oreste offspring to us' ( Rs. X. 85. 43-46 ); and then he partakes of ourds with the verse 'may all the gods unite our hearts' (Rg. X. 85. 47 ) and gives the remaining curds) to her or he besmears the heart (of both ) with the rest of the õjya ( with part of which he had already sacrificed).

teachers say ) a rși will be born as a son ( to them). When he has fulfilled these observances he should give the bride's shift to a brāhmaṇa who knows the Sūrya hymn (Rg. X. 85) and food to brahmanas. Then he should cause the brāhmaṇas to pronounce auspicious words. 

In this description of the samskārs of marriage there are three parts. There are certain rites that are preliminary, there are then a few rites that are of the essence of the samskāra viz. pānigrahaṇa, homa, going round the fire and the saptapadi, and there are certain rites like the seeing of the Pole star &o. that are subsequent to the central rites. The essential rites are mentioned by all sūtrakāras, but as to the preceding and sub sequent rites there is a great divergence in the details. Even as regards the essential rites the sequence in which they take place differs. For example, the Asv. gr. (I. 7. 7) describes going round the fire before saptapadi, while the Āp. gr. describes saptapadi (IV.16) before the act of going round the fire ( V.1). The Gobhila grhya (II. 2. 16), the Khādira gr. (1.3, 31), and Baud. gs. (I. 4. 10) describe panigrahaṇa after saptapadi while many other sūtrakāras describe it before saptapadi. Then again there are many acts reference to which is altogether omitted in the Aśv. gr., 0. g. there is no reference to madhuparka (whioh is mentioned in Āp. gr. III. 8, Baud. gr. I. %. 1, Mānava gr. I. 9) nor to kanyādūna (which is referred to in Pār. gr. I. 4 and described in detail in Mānava gr. 1. 8. 6–9). Aśv. probably omitted express mention of kanyādāda, because in defining the first four forms he uses the word 'dadyat' while in the last four there is no kanyādāna and Agy. wanted to desoribe ceremonies that were common to all forms. 

Taking as many gļhya sūtras as I could read, the following is a fairly exhaustive list of the different matters described in the sarskāra of marriage. A few notes are added against those that are deemed important. 1289 

Vadhūvara-gunaparikṣa: (examining the suitability of a girl or a bride-groom). This has been dealt with already (vide pp. 429-436 above). 

Varapreṣana: (gending persons to negotiate for the hand of the girl). The ancient custom seems to have been to send 

WALL 

1239. Among the principal ceremonies in marriage described by Kalidasa in tbe Raghuvarka VII are madbuparka, boma, going round the fire, panigrahapa, læja-bom, and ordrākpata-ropapa.

some person or persons (Rg. X. 85. 8-9) to the father of the girl for asking her in marriage. The same was the practice in the sūtras. Vide San. gļ. I. 6. 1-4 (where Rs. X. 85. 23 in the mantra recited when sending them), Baud. gr. I. 1. 14-15, Ap. gr. II. 16 and IV. 1-% and 7. Even in medieval times, parti cularly among kṣatriyas, the bride-groom was the first to seek for the hand of a girl. In the Harṣacarita, prince Grahavarmā of the Maukbari race sent messengers for the hand of princess Rājyasrl, sister of Harga 1840. In modern times among the brahmanas and many other castes, the girl's father has to seek a bride-groom, though among the sūdras and several other castes the old practice is retained. 

Vāgdāna or Vār-niscaya: (settling the marriage). This is described by Sān. gr. I. 6. 5-6. Medieval works like the 8. R. M. pp. 529-533 describe this ceremony at great length. 

Mandapa-karaṇa: Erecting a pandal where the ceremonios are to be performed.' Pār. gr. I. 4 says that marriage, caula, upanayana, keśānta and simanta are to be performed outside the house in a pandal. Vide Sam. Pr. pp. 817-818. 

Nandi-śrāddha and Punyāhavācana: These are referred to by Baud. gr. I. 1. 24; most of the gļhyasūtras are silent about these. Vide for these pp. 216, 218 above. 

Vadhūgļhāgamana: (bride-groom's going to the bride's house). Vide Sān. gr. I. 12. 1. 

Madhuparla: (reception of the bride-groom at the bride's house). Āp. gṛ. III. 8, Baud. gr. I. 2. 1, Mānaya gļ. 1. 9 and Kathaka gr. 24. 1-3 prescribe this. Vide below chap. X for madhuparka. Sān. gr. I. 12. 10 appears to refer to two madhu parkas, one before marriage and one after marriage (when the bride-groom returned to his own house). The commentator Adityadarśana on Kathaka gr. 24. 1 refers to the opinion of some that madhuparka should be offered at the close of the marriage, but states his own view that in all countries it is offered before marriage. 

Snāpana, Paridhāpana and Sarnahana: (making the bride bathe, put on new clothes and girding her with a string or rope of darbha. ) Vide Ap. gr. IV. 8 and Kathaka gf. 25. 4. Pār: gf. 

1240. शोभने च दिवसे प्रहधर्मणा कन्या प्रार्थयित प्रेषितस्प पूर्वागतस्पैव प्रधामदूत पुरुषस्य करे सर्वराजकुलसमक्ष दुहितदानजलमपातयत् । हर्षचरित 4th उच्छास.

I. 4 refers only to the putting on of two garments, Gobhila gṛ. ( II. 1. 17-18) refers to bathing and putting on a garment, Manava gr. ('1. 11. 4-6 ) refers to paridhāpana and semnahane. Strangely enough Gobbile gṛ. II. 1. 10 speaks of the sprinkling of the girl's head with the best of surā (wine), which the commentator explains as water. 

Samanījana: (anointing the bride and bride-groom ). Vide Sān. gr. I. 12.5, Gobhila gp. II. 2. 15, Pār. gr. I. 4, in all of which Rg. X. 85. 47 is cited as the mantra with which anointing or sprinkling is done. 

Pratisarabandha: (tying an amulet string on the bride's hand). Vide San. gr. I. 12, 6-8; Kausika sūtra 76. 8. 

Vadhūvara-niskramana: (the coming out into the pandal of the bride and bride-grooun from the inner part of the house ). Pār. gr. I. 4. 

Parasparasamiksana: (looking at each other). Vide Pār. gr. I. 4, Ap. gr. IV. 4, Baud. gr. I. 1. 24-25. Pār. gr. I. 4 says that the bride-groom recites Rg. X. 85. 44, 40, 41 and 37 at this time. Ap. gr. IV, 4 and Baud. gs, say he recites Rs. X. 85. 44. The Aśv. gs. pariĝista I. 23 says that first of all a piece of cloth is held between the bride-groom and bride and that at the proper astrological moment it is removed and then the two see each other. Lagbu-Asvalayana-smrti (15. 20) also says the same. This practice is observed even now, When the interposed oloth is held between the bride and bride-groom verses called manga laṣtakas are repeated by brāhmaṇas, the last of which verses is *tad-eva lagnam sudinam tad-eye' &o. 

Kanyadūna : (the gift of the bride ). Vide Pār, gr. I. 4, Mānava gr. I. 8. 6-9, Varāha gļ. 13. The Aøv. gr. pariṭiṣta sets out the procedure about the kanyādāna which is the same open now. The Saṁ, K. p.779 notes about half a dozen different methods of uttering the formula in kanyādāna. It is in this rite that the father of the girl says that the bride-groom should not prove false to the bride in dharma, artha and kama and he responds with the words 'I shall not do so' (nātioarāmi), 1241 This is done even now.

Agnisthāpana and homa: ( establishing the fire and offering of ajya oblations into fire). Here there is great divergence about the number of ābutis and the mantras to be recited. Vide Aśv. gr. I. 7.3 and I. 4. 3-7, Ap. gf. V. 1 ( 16 ahutis with 16 mantras), Gobbila gr. II. 1. 24-26, Mānava gf. I. 8, Bhara dvāja I. 13 &c. 

Pūnigrahana: (Taking hold of the bride's hand ). 

Lājahoma: (Offering of fried grain into fire by the bride ). Vide Āśv. gr. I. 7,7-13, Pār. gr. I. 6, Ap. gr. V. 3-5, San. gr. I. 13. 15-17, Gobhila gr. II. 2.5, Mānava gr. I. 11. 11, Baud. gr. 1. 4. 25. &c. Aśv. gr. says that the bride makes three offerings of fried grain when mantras are repeated by the bridegroom and a fourth is made of the remaining lājas by the bride silently. Some others speak of only three offerings by the bride. 

Agniparinayana: (the bride-groom going in front takes the bride round the fire and water jar). It is while doing this that he utters the words 'amohasmi' &c. (vide San. gr. I. 13. 4, Hir. gr. I. 20. 2 &c ). 

Afmārohana: (making the bride tread on a mill-stone ). These three are done thrice viz. lājahoma, then agnipari mayana and asmārobana, one after another. 

Saptapadi : (taking seven steps together ). This is done to the north of the fire; there are seven small heaps of rice and the bride-groom makes the bride step on each of these seven with her right foot beginning from the west. 

Murdhābhiṣeka : ( sprinkling holy water on the head of the bride and of the bride-groom according to some and on the head of the bride only according to others ). Aśv. gr. I. 7. 20, Pār. gr. I. 8, Gobbila gr. IL %. 15-16 &c. 

Sūryodiksaṇa: (making the bride look towards the sun ). Pār, gr. I. 8 speaks of this and employs the mantra 'tac-oakṣur' (Rg. VII. 66. 16 = Vaj. S. 36. 24 ). 

Hydayasparsa: (touching the bride' heart with a mantra ). Pār. gr. I. 8, Bhār. gr. I. 17, Baud. gr. I. 4. 1. 

Preksakānumantrana: (addressing the speotators with reference to the newly married bride ). Mānava gr. I. 12. 1 (whloh employs Rg. X. 85. 33 ). Pār. I. 8 employs that verse for reciting over the bride. 

Dakṣiṇādāna : ( gifts to the ācarya). Par. gr. I. 8, San. 8f. I. 14. 13-17 ( both prescribe a cow as the fee in the case of

brahmanas, a village in marriages of kings and nobles, a horse in marriages of vaisyas &c. ). Gobhila gr. II. 3. 23, Baud. gr. I. 4.38 speak of only a cow. 

Gyhapravesa: (entering the bride-groom's houso ). 

Gphapraveśaniya homa: (sacrifice on entering the bride groom's house ), Śān. gr. I. 16. 1-12, Gobbila gr. II. 3, 8-12, Ap. gr. VI. 6-10. 

Dhruvārundhati-darsana: (pointing out the Pole star and Arundhati to the bride at night on the day of marriage ). Āøv. gr. I. 7. 22 speaks of the seven sages in addition, Mānava gr. I. 14. 9 speaks of the same three and adds Jivanti, Bhār, gr. I. 19 speaks of Dhruva, Arundhati and other nakṣatras, Āp. gr. VI. 12 ( only Dhruva and Arundbatı), Pār. I. 8 (only Dhruva ). According to San. gr. I. 17. 2, Hir. g§. I. 22. 10 both the bride and the bride-groom remain silent till night. According to Aśv. gr. only the bride does so. Gobbila gs. IL 3. 8-12 describes Dhruvārundhati-darsana before gȚhapraveśa. 

Agneya Sthalipaka : (iness of cooked food offered to Agni). Vide Ap. gr. VII. 1-5, Gobhila II. 3. 19-21, Bhar. gf. I. 18, Hir. gf. I. 23. 1-6. 

Trirātravrata: (keeping for three nights after marriage certain observances). Vide A$v. above p. 530 for the observances which are enumerated by almost all sūtrakāras. Ap. gr. VIII. 8-10, Baud. gr. I. 5. 16-17 contain the interesting injunction that the newly married pair should sleep on the ground on the same bed for three nights, but should interpose between them a staff of udumbara wood anointed with perfumes and wrapped round with a germent or a thread and that on the fourth night it should be removed with the verses Rg. X. 85. 21-22 and thrown into water. 

Caturthikarma : (rite on the fourth night after marriage ). This has been described above (pp. 202-204). 

In the medieval digests certain other ceremonies are mentioned and they are observed in modern times also. A few of them will be noted below. Here again the order is not the same in all works. The Dharmasindhu p. 265 refers to this divergence 

Simāntapājana: (bonouring the bride-groom and his party on their arrival at the bride's village ). This is done before vāgniscaya in modern times. Vide Sam. K. p. 768; Dharma sindhu III. p. 261.536 



( Ch. 1X 

Gauri-Hara-pūjā: (worship of Śiva and his consort Gauri). Sam. K. p. 766, S. R. M. p. 534 and 544, Dharmasindhu p. 261 ( notes that there are several views as to when kanyādāna takes place) describe this. Images of Gauri and Hara are to be made of gold or silver or pictures of them on a wall &o. or on a piece of cloth or stone are to be drawn and worshipped by the intanding bride after puṇyābavācans and before kanyādāna. Vide Laghu-Āśvalāyana 15. 35. 

Indrāni-pījā: (worship of Indrāni, the consort of god Indra). Vide San. K. p. 756, 8. R. M. p. 545. This seems to have been comparatively an anoient practice as Kalidasa in Raghuvamsa VII. 3 seems to refer to it (' there was absence of disturbers of svayamvara on account of the presence of Sacl'). Probably Sack was worshipped before the svayarmara began. 

Taila-haridrāropana: (Applying turmerio powder to the bride-groom's body from what is left after the bride's body has been so treated). Vide Sam. K. p. 757, Dharmasindhu III. p. 257. 

Ardrākṣatāropana: (mutual showering of wet unbroken rice grains by the bride and bride-groom). In a vessel of some metal like silver & little milk is poured and clarified butter is sprinkled over it and unbroken wet rice grains are poured therein. The bridegroom applies milk and ghoe to the joined hands of the bride twice and thrice places rice grains in the joined hands of the bride so that her anjali becomes filled up and twice sprinkles ghee over her joined hands. Some other person does the same to the joined hands of the bride-groom and the bride's father places a golden piece on the joined hands of both. Then the bride-groom places his joined hands on those of the bride whose father then repeats & mantra and raises her up; she then pours the rice over the head of the bridegroom who follows her in the same way. This is done thrice by each and then lastly by the bride ( 1. e. seven times in all). Then the priest sprinkles on their heads water with an udumbara twig together with durvā grass after reciting verses 'Apo hi atbā &c. (Rg. X. 9. 1-3)'. Then the couple make a tilaka mark on each other's forehead, garland each other and tie a thread with a turmeric piece on each other's hand ( whioh is variously called 'kankaṇa-bandhana' or 'kautuka-bandhana'). Vide Sam. Pr. pp. 828-829, S. R. M. p. 556. Kalidasa in Raghuvamga VII describes ardrākṣatd-ropaña as the last of the rites of marriage and in VIII. 1 speaks of the kautuka,

Mangalasutra-bandhana: (tying & string having golden and other beads on it round the neck of the bride ). This is now regarded as the most important ornament which no woman will part with as long as her husband is alive. But the sūtras are entirely silent about it. Among the earliest references is one from Saunaka smṛti 1848 (ms. in Bombay University Library, folio 39 b). The Laghu-Āśvalāyana sıști 15. 33 also prescribes it and the mantra to be employed when doing so. Gadadhara on Pār. gr. I. 8 says that mangala-sūtra should be worn and garlands be placed round their necks by the bride and bride-groom, though the sūtra of Paraskara is silent on the point. The Baud. gr, sesa sutra V, 5 in describing 'arkavivāls' speaks of māngalya sūtra to be tied to the plant. It is not clear whether it means the same as the mangalasūtra now tied by married women round their necks. About the nose-ring or nose ornament to which all women whose husbands are living attach the greatest importance in modern times, the sūtras, smitis and even the early digests are entirely silent. Dr. Altekar in his recent work Position of Hindu women in Hindu Civilization' pp. 362-64 holds from the evidence of the sculptures tbroughout India-that the nose-ring was unknown throughout the whole of India during the entire Hindu period' (i. e. till about 1000 A. D.). Mr. P. K. Gode in Annals of B. O. R. I. vol. XIX (for 1939) pp. 313-34 adduces evidence to show that a nose ornament was known to literary works from at least about 1000 A. D.:

This is done when the bride is about to leave the father's place to go to the bride-groom's place after marriage.

Two interesting questions arise viz. when can a marriage be said to be final and irrevocable and what would bappen if & marriage is brought about by force or fraud. 

Manu says (VIII. 168 ) 'what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force, aleo what has been caused to be written by force and all other transactions done by force, Manu has declared void ;' and in VIII. 165 he places fraudulent transactions on the same footing as those brought about by force. There is great difficulty in applying these dicta to marriages. We saw above that Vas. Dh. S. (17. 73 ) and Baud, Dh. S, declare that if a girl has been carried off by force and has not been wedded with the repetition of sacred texts she may be given to another man in marriage. Viśvarūpe (p. 74 ) and Aparārka (p. 79 ) add a gloss that this can be done only after she has undergone a prāyaścitta. From this it appears that if the marriage rites (like saptapadi) have been performed, the ancient law.givers would not bave declared the marriage null and void even if the girl had been carried away by force or married by fraud. In modern works on Hindu Law the proposition is stated 1244 that '& marriage, though performed with the necessary ceremonies, inay be set aside by the court, if it was brought about by force or fraud.' This opinion is based on what was said in some decided cases 8. g. Aunjona Dasi v. Prahlada Chandra (6 Bengal L. R. 243 at p. 254), Venkatachurgulu v. Rangacharyulu I. L. R. 14 Mad. 316 at p. 320, Mulchand v. Bhudhia 1. L. R. 22 Bom. 812. But in none of these cases was a marriage duly solemnized by the performance of the rites of pāpigrabana, going round the fire and saptapadi, set aside. There are mere

ohiter dicta in these cases to the effect that a marriage may be set aside by the court for force or fraud. 

The Vas. Db. 8. (17.72) goes so far as to observe 'when & girl has been promised in marriage (and the promise has been confirmed) with water, if the intended bride-groom dies, but tbe Vedic mantras have not been recited, that girl still belongs to her father (and may be given to another)'. Kātyāyana 1345 has a similar verse 'if after choosing a girl as his bride, a man dies (or is unheard of) the girl after the lapse of three monthly periods may marry another'. And another verse of the same author says that if a person after giving & gratuity for a girl and stridhana to her goes abroad, the girl may be kept unmarried for a year and then may be given to another. Manu (VIII. 227) says 'the Vedic mantras recited in the marriage rite are a suro indication of wife-hood; but their completion should be under stood by the wise as cccurring on taking the seventh step'. Aparārka p. 94 (on Yāj. I. 65 ) quotes a similar verse from Nārada (stripum & v. 3). The Udvālatattva p. 129 quotes Yama to the same effect. So it follows that the marriage be comes complete and irrevocable the moment the saptapadi rite is performed, but before tbat rite is gone through there is a locus pænitentice or a power to resile from what has been under taken. Before the saptapadi is performed, if the bride-groom dies, the bride is still a maiden and not & widow and can be married again 248. The most essential ceremonies of marriage are the homa and saptapadi. The Dronaparva'247 says that promise of a daughter and giving a daughter with water are not certain means of knowing wife-hood but saptapadi is known to be the completion of marriage. If any of the other ceremonies are wanting that would not vitiate the marriage. In I. L. R. 12 Cal. 140, it has been hold that the viddhi-śrāddha is not an essential ceremony and its absence would not vitiate marriage.

Even the Kāmaśūtra 1248 quotes the unanimous opinion of the dcāryas that marriages celebrated before fire as a witness cannot be revoked. In the case of sūdras there are no Vedic mantras and so in their case the completion of marriage will be determined according to custom. The digests like Gṭ. R. say (p. 57) that in the case of sūdras the marriage will be complete when the sūdra girl holds the fringe of the garment of the bride-groom. 

Manu (IX. 47) declares 'once is the partition of inheri. tance made, once is a maiden given in marriage'. This rule really means that once the ceremony of marriage is completed by saptapadi, the marriage is irrevocable and the girl cannot thereafter be given to any one else. But if a girl is only promised in marriage and if a more worthy suitor subsequently presents himself, then the father may commit breach of promise and give her in marriage to another. Vide also Manu (IX. 71 and VIII. 98). Yāj. I. 65 states the rule and the exception *A girl is given only once; a person who after having pro mised to give, deprives that man of ber, is liable to the punishment of a thief; but if a more worthy suitor approaches, the father may deprive the foriner ( suitor) of her (hand) though promised'. The Mahābhārata ( Anuśāsana 44. 35 ) says that up to pānigrabana any one may ask for the hand of a maiden (even though promised before to another). Nārada ( stripu msa VV. 30 and 32 ) contains similar provisions. 1949 Conversely, if a man agrees to marry a girl and subsequently discovers defects in her or if she is diseased or already deflowered or given by practising fraud he may refuse to marry her. Vide Manu IX, 72. If a guardian gives away a girl without declaring the defects of a girl (and they are subsequently discovered) the guardian should be fined in the highest ammercement (according to Yaj. I. 66 and the lowest, socording to Nārada, stripumba v. 33). Aparārka 125° (p. 95 ) and others add that the defects referred to must be latent and not apparent or patent to view, If a suitor repudiates a girl who is free from defeots be should be fined in the highest ammercement and if he falsely accuses her of defects be should be fined one hundred panas (Vāj I. 66

and Narada, strīpumsa v. 34). Nārada adds that he who abandons & faultless girl should be punished and should be made to marry the same girl. 125? 

Some of the smrtis and digests are very much exercised over the question of the bride having menstruation while the marriage ceremonies are in progress and homa is about to be performed. Atri 1283 ( Jivānanda part 1, p. 11, chap. V) pre scribes that having made the girl bathe with the Havismati (with a verse in which the word havis occurs, probably Rg. X. 88.1 or VIII. 72. 1) and to put on other garments and having offered an āhuti of clarified butter with the verse 'Yuñjate manaḥ' (Rg. V. 81. 1) the ceremonies should be proceeded with. The Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 17 ) first quotes two verses (the same as Atri's) and proposes an alternative method viz. that the bride and the bride-groom should stay separate from each other for three days and on the fourth day after ceremonially bathing themselves should perform the homa in the saine fire.
