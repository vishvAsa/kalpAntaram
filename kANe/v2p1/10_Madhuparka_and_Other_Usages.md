CHAPTER X MADHUPARKA AND OTHER USAGES 

Madhuparka: ( offering of honey by way of honour to 8 distinguished guest). The word literally means' a ceremony in which honey is shed or poured'(on the hand of a person). The word occurs in the Jaiminiya Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa 1283 18. 4. The Nirukta ( I. 16 ) also refers to the usage of offering madhu parka with the word madhuparka repeated thrice. It appears that the Ait. Br. III. 4 when it says that if the ruler of men comes as a guest or any one else deserving of honour comes, people kill a bull or a cow (that has contracted a habit of abortion)' refers to Madhuparka, 1854 though that word is not actually used. In all grhya sūtras it is described at length. Most of the details are the same, the principal difference being that often different mantras are prescribed, though soine ( like the verse 'mātā rudrāṇām') are the same. The madhuparka "255 is offered to sfurks (priests officiating at sacrifices ) when they are chosen for a sacrifice, to a snātaka who has come to one's house, to the king ( who rules one's country, when he comes to one's house ), to one's acārya, father-in-law, paternal and maternal uncles. The Mānava gr. (I. 9. 1), Khādira gr. IV. 4. 21, Vāj. I. 110 say that six persons deserve arghya (madhuparka ) viz. ștvik, ācārya, the bride-groom, the king, the Bnātaka and a person who is dear to one. Some like Baud. 1856 gr. I. 2. 65 add 'atithi' (guest ). Vide Gaut. V. 25, Ap. gr. 13. 19-20, Ap. Dh. S. II. 3. 8. 5-6, Baud, Dh, S. II. 8. 63-64,

Manu III. 119, Sabhāparva 36. 23-24, Gobbila gr. IV, 10.23-24. It is laid down that if the persons enumerated come to one's house within a year after madhuparka has been onde offered, then it need not be offered again ( in the same year), but when a marriage is being celebrated in one's house or a yajña is being performed, then madhuparka must be offered to those persons (even if one year has not elapsed since the madhu parka was previously offered). Vide Gaut. V. 26-27, Ap. Dh. $. II. 3. 8. 6, Yāj. I. 110, Khādira gr. IV, 4. 26, Gobbila gr. IV. 10. 26. Rtviks are to be honoured in each yājña, even though several yajñas are performed in the same year ( Yāj. I. 110). Manu (III. 120 ) says that a king and & snataka are to be honoured with madhuparka only when they visit one's house in 8 yajña. Viśvarūps ( on Yāj. I. 109 ) Bays that madhuparka is to be offered to the king only and not to any ksatriya. Medhātithi on Manu III. 119 says that when & king, whether a kṣatriya or not, comes to one's place madhu parka was to be offered, but not to a sūdra king. According to gļhya-pariśiṣta the madhuparka is to be perforined according to the rites prescribed in the sakh of the receiver and not of the giver. 1957 

The procedure of madhuparka is set out from the Aśv. gr.1858 (1.24.5-26 ) " He pours honey into ourds or clarified butter if no honey can be had. A seat,1289 water for wasbing the feet, arghya water (i. e. water perfumed with flowers &o.), water for ācamana, honey mixture, a cow; every one of these they announce three times ( to the person who has arrived). The person (to be honoured ) should sit down on the seat made of northward pointed darbha grass with the verse 1260 'I am the highest one among my kindred, as the sun among lights' (lightnings ). Here I tread on whomsoever bears enmity to me.' Or he should repeat this verse after he has trodden on it. He should make ( thu host) wash his feet; the right foot he should

When bis feet have been washed, he receives the argbya water in his joined hands and then he performs acamana with the water for sipping with the formula thou art the seat (or first layer) of ambrosia ', 1281 He should look at the madhu parka, when it is being brought to him, with the mantra 'I look at thee with the eye of Mitra'. He accepts it (the madhuparka) in the joined hands with the formula' by the command (urging) of god Savitr, by the aris of Asvins and the hands of Pūṣan, I accept thee ( Vaj S. I. 24). He looks at it with the three ṛk verses 1262 the winds blow honey to the righteous man' (Rg. I. 90. 6-8). He (takes it into his left hand ), stirs it about thrice from left to right with the thumb and the finger next to the smallest and wipes ( his fingers ) towards the east with the formula 'may the Vasus eat thee with the Gayatri metre'; with the formula 'may the Rudras eat thee with the Triṣtubh metre' (he wipes fingers) towards the south; with the formula 'may the Adityas eat thee with the Jagati metre' towards the wost; with the formula 'may Viśve Devas eat theo with the Anuṣtubh metre' towards the north; with the formula 'to the bhūtas ( beings ) thee' he three times takes (some of the madhuparka materials ) from out of the middle of it (and throws it up). He should partake of it for the first time with the formula 1263. the milk of Virāj art thou ', for the second time with 'may I obtain the milk of Virāj', the third time with in me may the milk of Padya Virāj dwell'. He should not eat the whole madhuparka and should not eat to satiety. He should give the remainder (out of the madhuparka materials ) to a brahmana towards the north; but if no brāhmaṇa is available he should throw it into water; or he may eat the whole. He then takes ācamana with the water intended for it with the

formula 'thou art the cover of ambrosia,' 1804 He sips water & second time with the formula "truth I fame! fortune, may Fortune resort to me.' When he has sipped water, they announce to him the cow. Having muttered the words destroyed is my sin, my sin is destroyed', he says 'om, do it if he desires to have the cow killed; if he is desirous of letting her go, he mutters the verge the mother of Rudras and daughter of Vasus "1264A ( Rg. VIII. 101. 15 ) and says 'let her go'. Let the inadhuparka not be without flesh." 

A few small inatters may be noted. Several ghya-sūtras (such as the Mānava ) describe madhuparka as a part of the marriage rite, while others like Asv. describe it independently. Others like Hir. gi. (1. 12-13) describe it as part of Samā. vartana There is divergence about the substances mixed in offering madhuparka. Asv. gr, and Āp. gr. (13. 10) presoribe & mixture of honey and curds or clarified butter and curds. Others like Pār, gr. I. 3 prescribe & mixture of three (ourds, honey and butter ). Ap. gṛ. (13. 11-12 ) states the view of some that those three may be mixed or five (those three with fried yava gruin and barley ). Hir. gr. I. 12. 10-12 gives the option of mixing three or five (curds, honey, ghee, water and ground grain). The Kausika sūtra (92) speaks of nine kinds of mixtures viz, Brāhma (honey and ourds ), Aindra ( of pāyaga ), Saumya (curds and ghee), Pauspa (ghee and mantha), Sārasvata (milk and ghee), Mausala ( wine and ghee, this being used only in Sautrāmaṇi and Rājasūya sacrifices), Vāruña (water and ghee), Srāvana ( sesame oil and ghee ), Pāriprājaka (sesama oil and oil cake ). The Mānava gr. I. 9. 22 says that the Veda declares that the madhuparka must not be without flesh and so it recommends that if the cow is let loose, goat's meat or payasa (rice cooked in milk) may be offered; the Hir, gr. I. 13. 14 says that other meat should be offered; Baud. gr. gays (I. 2.51-54) that when the cow is let off, the flesh of a goat or ram may be offered or some forest flesh (of a deer &c.) may be offered, as there can be no madhuparka without flesh or if one is unable to offer flesh one may cook ground grains. As the cow became Baored, it became unthinkable to kill her and so other flesh was

offered. When even flesh-eating came to be abhorred, then only pāyasa and such other things were recommended. The Adiparva ( 60. 13-14) refers to Janamejaya's reception of Vyāsn with madhuparka and Vyasa's letting the cow looge. This abhorrence of flesh-eating will be dealt with later on. In modern times there is generally no madhuparka except in marriage and then too it is a simple matter and the elaborate procedure presoribed in some of the gļhya sūtras is hardly ever followed. 

Certain peculiar ceremonies relating to marriage may now be described very briefly. In order to avert early widowhood ( which was judged from her horoscope ) for the girl to be married, & ceremony called kumbha-vivāha was performed. It is described in Sam. Pr. (p. 868 ), Nirnayasindhu p. 310, Sam. K. (p. 746), S. R. M. (p. 528 ) and other works. On the day previous to the marriage & jar of water in which & golden image of Viṣnu is dipped is decked with flowers &c. and the girl is surrounded in a network of tbreads, Varuna and Viṣnu are worshipped and prayed to give long life to the intended bride-groom. Then the jar is taken out and broken in & pool of water and then water is sprinkled over the girl with five twigs and to the accompaniment of Rg. VII. 49 and then brahmanas are fed. 

The Sam. Pr. (pp. 868-869) speaks of Asvattha-vivāha which is like kumbha-vivāba and performed for good luok to the bride and averting widowhood. Here the Aśvattha tree is substituted for the jar and a golden image of Viṣou is worshipped. The image is then given to a brāhmaṇa, 

Arkavivāha: When a man has the misfortune to lose by death two wives one after another, before marrying a third wife he goes through a ceremony of marriage with the arka plant. This is described in Sam. Pr. pp. 876-889, Sam. K. p. 819, Nirnayasindhu, p. 328. It is described in Baud. gs. seṣasūtra 

V.5 also. 

Another question which takes up much space in ancient works but which is now of hardly any importance is parivedana, When a male got married before his elder brother or where a person married a younger girl before her elder sister was married, this act was called parivedana and was severely oon. demned as a serious encroachment on the rights of seniority and as & sin. Gaut. 15. 18 and Ap. Dh. 8. (II. 5. 12. 22) declare that a younger brother married before an elder brother, and an elder

brother married after a younger brother are sinners, and should not be invited at a sraddha. Ap. adds that one who marries a younger sister before her elder sister is married, one who marries an elder sister after the younger sister has been married, one whose younger brother has kindled the sacred fires or offered a soma sacrifice before him (and a younger brother who kindles the sacred fires or offers soma sacrifice before his elder brother) are also equally sinful. Vās. Dh. 8. I. 18, Visṇu Dh. 8. 37. 15-17 also have similar provisions and Vas. Db. 8. ( 20.7-10) pres cribes krochra penance of twenty days for the husband of the younger sister married before her elder sister and for the husband of the elder sister married after the younger one, requires each of them to offer his wife to the other for the sake of form (to remove the slur) and then to wed her again with his assent. 1285 Vide Baud. Db. S. II. 1. 40 also. The younger brother who marries before the elder brother is called pariretta or parivividāna ( Manu III, 171, Ap. Dh. 8. II. 5. 12. 22) or parivindaka (Yaj. I. 223 ), the elder brother before whom the younger brother marries is called parivitia or parivinna or pariritti ( Manu III. 171 ), the younger sister who marries before the elder sister is called agredidhiṣt (Gaut. 15. 15, Vas. I. 18) or parivedini, the elder sister before whom her younger sister marries is called didhiṣi. The busbands of these two last respectively bear the appellations agre-didhiṣūpati and didhi. ṣūpati. The father or other guardian who gives away the girl in any of these cases of parivedang is called paridāyī or paridata. The younger brother who kindles the sacred fire before the elder is styled 'paryādhātr' and the elder brother who is so treated is called 'paryāhita' (Gaut. 15. 18). Manu IIL 172 ( which is almost the same as Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 30 and Viṣnu Dh, S. 54. 16 ) says that the parivettā, the parivitta, the girl whom the younger brother marries before the elder, the man who gives away the girl in marriage and the officiating priest-these fire all fall into hell1288 (and must perform the penance of Cāndrāyana according to Viṣnu ).

Yāj. IIT. 265 quotes Hārita-dharmagūtra on this topic to the same effect. Medhātithi on Manu III. 171 refers to the view of some that if a son kindles the sacred fire before his father, the same rule applies as between brothers and then refutes that view. Aparārka p. 446 quotes Uśanas that & person may kindle sacred fires even before his father or grandfather with the latter's consent. The Trikāṇdamaṇdana ( I. 76-77 ) says that there is no sin in taking agnihotra and performing a sacrifice before an elder brother and the incurring of sin is only restricted to marriage, while the Smrtyarthasāra (p. 13 ) holds the opposite view that one should not kindle the Vedic fires before one's father even with the latter's consent. The Viṣnu Dh. S. ( 37. 15-17 ) enumerates parivedana among upapātakas. Gaut. ( 18. 18-19 ) prescribes that if an elder brother has gone to a foreign country his younger brother must wait twelve years before he takes a wife or kindles sacred fires or six years according to some. 1287 There is a similar text of Vas. quoted by Apararka p. 445. 

In certain cases marrying or kindling saored fires before an elder brother is not condemned. Medhātithi on Manu III. 171 quotes a verse 'One need not wait where the elder brother is a lunatic, or is a sinner, or leprous, impotent, or suffering from tuberoulosis' and remarks that this is only illustrative (i. e. one need not wait where the elder brother has no adhikārs for marriage or for kindling fires) 1288 Vide Atri v. 105 ( Anan. ed.) for a similar verse. Another verge of Atri (v. 106 ) says that there is no blemish in marrying before the elder brother, if the latter is impotent or gone abroad, or palita or has become a reoluse or is devoted to Yogagastra 1269. Vide Gobhila smrti (1. 72-74) for similar verses ( which are quoted by the Gr. R. p. 90), Trikāndamapdana I. 68–74, Smṛtyarthasāra p. 13 and Sam. Pr. pp. 760-766. 

The ideas about the wrong committed by a younger brother or sister marrying before an elder one reach far back into Vedic antiquity. In the Tai. Br. (III. 2. 9) there is a story that the gods transferred (rubbed off) their sin to the Apyas and then

there is a succession of persons who are all guilty of blame or sin and each preceding one among whom is said to have passed it on to each succeeding one viz. sūryabhyudita, sūryabbinim rukta, kunakbin, śyāvadat, agredidhiṣū, parivitta, vīraban, brah. mahan, The Vas. Dh.1270 S. I. 18 arranges persons called sinners (enasvin) almost in the same order as in the Tai. Br. Here (in Tai. Br.) we have parivitta and agredidhiṣu. In another passage of the Tai. Br. (III. 4. 4) while speaking of Puruṣamedha, it is said that the parivitta is consigned as a victim to ill-luck (nir-sti), the parivividāna to distress (ārti) und the didbiṣūpati to non-success (arūddhi).
