PREFACE 

deals win in the and pavlora os 

Tho third volume of the 11istory of Dharma istra vys published in October 1946. In thc brios presocr to that saiunin I intimated that the remaining topics of Dharmajstra soujd be dealt with in ono volume. But ne 1 proccoded with the laski ) found that that was a mjecalcnlntion. To present in cur volung all the topics that remained in the manner and on the scale that I had adopted in the first three yolumes you found to be impossible. Besides, as nis ngo advanced, I could not maintain the samne snced and finiālı the whole history in a few years as I intiinated I would do in tho profica to the third Yolumo. Thorefore, I had to dccide, however tolucantly, in spread the remaining work over two volumea, Oving in the scarcity of paper and paucity of skilled workers, the volume has been in the press for more than three ycars This roluinn deals with eight topics, riz Pātako, Prāfoscitta, Kormaripala, Antyesti, Āśauca, Suddhi, Sraddlia and Tirthnyātrā. These subjects are of great interest to anthropologists. There was great temptation for me, when dealing with these topics, lo indulge in dwelling upon similar beliera, usages and rites des cribed in such works as Frazer's 'Golden Bough,' For two reasons, however, I have rarely succumbed to this temptation, In the first place, thioro was the fear of increasing the bulk of tho work which has already assuined onormous proportions, In the second place, dwolling on comparisons of ancient and medieval Indian usages and rites with similar usages and rites found elsesphere is liable to serious misunderstanding, Frazer's volumes are largely made up of materials concerning the beliefs, usages and rites of very primitive people. It appeared to me that readers of such comparisons might be led to think that people in ancient and medioyal India were at a primitive stage of culture, while as a matter of fact they had a very high culture in most mattors, although they rotained certain beliefs and usages derived from remote antiquity. Many cultured societies retain some usages that belong to periods of antiquity. The queen in France was not to leave for a whole year the room in which the death of her consort was announced to her. Wretched old women deemed to be witches were pro secuted and sentenced to death in-England up to the beginning 

History of Dhiar mašūsira 

of the eighteenth century, while Manu (IX. 290) more than two thousand yoars ago prescribed the mild punishmont of a fine of two hundred panas for all incantations intended to destroy lifo, for magic rites and for raising ghosts and goblins. My main aim has throughout beon to discovor, colloct, classify and interpret the facts of the various departmonts of Dharmaśāstra and my endeavour has beon, as far as in me lies, to present the truth with detachment and intellectual integrity and without bias (except what might have been unconsciously engendered in my mind owing to my being born and brought up in a brahmana family ) to show the continuity, the dovelopments and transformations in Indian beliefs, rites and usages throughout the ages and, wbilo bringing the past in its caugal relations with the presont, to indicato and suggest future trends and changes in those matters, f 

The fifth and last volumo will mainly deal with the following subjects vratas and utsayas, śānti rites, kāla and muhurta; paurāna-dharma, the influence of the Pūrvam māmgā and other śāstras on dharmaśāstra; the cosmological, religious and philosophical background of dharmaśāstra; the fundamental aspects of our culture through the ages; the impact of modern social and other ideas and trends on the dogmas and ideals of dharmaśāstra and the future of the latter This by itself is rather an ambitious programme. Now that I am over seventy-three years of age and suffering from several ailments I have mis givings whether I would be able to write this last volume and publish it while all mental and physical faculties are sound I ain myself extremely anxious to write this last volume as early as possible and bring to a conclusion an undertaking to which I have devoted all my leisure for over thirty years regardless of monetary losses and bodily ailments. With that object in view I have given up either entirely or very largely most of my other activities and engagements and have thereby offended many of my friends. 

This volume also is full of quotations, references to inscriptions and judicial decisions, The reasons for this have 

+ Prof. J. B Bury, a distinguished Professor of History in the Cambridge University, thought that freedom from bias was not possible abd was not also desirable, since a man writing history completely free from bias would produce a colourless and dull work Vide 'Selected Essays' (edited by Harold Temperley, 1930) p. 70

been stated at length in the preface to the second volume and therefore they need not be repeated here. The list of additions to this volume is much larger than in the preceding volumes. I may be pardoned for frankly stating the reason. The first and second volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra were published so far back as 1930 and 1941 respectively. No second edition of these has yet been called. It seems to me quite possible that during my life-tiine no second edition of the volumes of the History, or at least of this volume, might appear, Therefore, I tried to incorporate by way of additions such in. formation as had escaped me while the work was being written in order to make it as complete as possible, 

I now discharge the pleasant duty of acknowledging my obligations to others Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance, the Vedic Index of Professors Macdonell and Keith, and the volumes of the Sacred Books of the East have been very useful in pre paring this volume as in the case of its predecessors. Parama hamsa Swami Keralananda Sarasvati of Wai has been a tower of strength in all matters of doubt and difficulty and has helped me by offering prompt guidance in solving some intricate problems. I am highly obliged to Mr. S. N. Sayadi of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona, for help in the correction of proofs and to Mr. P. M. Purandare, Advocate (0, S.), Bombay High Court, and Tarkatirtha Raghunath Shastri Kokje of Lonavla for reading the printed sheets as they came and making valuable suggestions.

It is difficult to name all those who in various ways, during the progress of this volume for over six years, kindly rendered assistance, but I should lika to make special mention of Prof. K V. Rangaswami Aiyangar, Mr. A. N, Krishna Aiyangar, Dr. A. S, Altekar, Dr. S K Belvalkar, Prof. G. H. Bhatt, Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya, Mr. N. G. Chapekar, Dr. R. N. Dandekar, Mr. D.

Velankar. Thanks are due to these scholars and many others for help and interest in this volume. I am conscious that in spite of so much help and generous encouragement from friends there are in this volumo several mistakes, the sole responsibility for which rests on my shoulders. In a work replete with thousands of quotations and references 

History of Dharmaśāstra 

it is quite likely that many slips have escaped my attention. $ For these and for the elision of a few diacritical marks and the displacement of parts of Sanskrit letters in the process of printing the indulgence and forgiveness of all readers are sought. I sincerely thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan Press Poona, for carrying out the work of printing this volume with care in spite of difficulties caused by paper and labour shortage.

PV KANE 

$ I take this opportunity of correcling two mistahes that I regret I committed in the third solame of the History of Dharmasāstra. In note 1886 on p 968 (of vol III) I refer to a work of Mr Batul oath Bhattacharya that contaigs a full treatment of Kalivarjya, I suggested 10 tbat note that Mr, Bhattacharya probably retouched his thesis after 1937 though it was written in 1933, in view of the fact that he referred to the Smrtimuktāphala (which was published in 1937 by Mr Gbarpure) Through oversight I forgot that Mr. Bhattacharya had expressly stated that he used the transcript of a ms of the Sportimuktāphala specially made for him. Therefore, I was wrong in my surmise that he probably retouched his thesis and I must say that the thesis as publisbed in 1943 is the same as that written in 1933 for the Jogendrachandra Ghosc Research Prize The second mistake refers to Dr, U, N Ghosal on p 32 (of sol III) I stated 'it is not possible to hold as Jayaswal, U Ghosal and others do tbat the theory of social contract was the earlier one aod the theory of diviac right of kings sas later on propound ed by the Manusmrti to support tbe brābmana empire of Pusyamitra' IA Writing this sentence my memory was at fault I find that Dr. Ghosal does not hold the view that I attributed to bim. In the 'Indian Historical Quarterly' (vol 23, pp 68-70) Dr Ghosal justly protests against my bracketrag him with Jayasual, but I cannot help observing that the last sentence in the paper shows unexpecled accrbily In bis whole career as a writer Dr Ghosal was not probably guilty of a single slip and could not therefore briog bimself to belici e that may maustahe might bave beca bona fide.. ..

lars have 15 date as 400 this question in hi 

N. B.-Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are conjectural and disputed by several scholars. Most of the dates about authors from the 8th or 9th century refer to the probable periods of their literary activity except in the case of a few authors such as Sankarācārya and Vidyāpati. 4000 B, C.-1000 B. C-The period of the Vedic Sambitās, 

Brābmanas and Upanisads. Some hymns of the Rgveda, of the Atharvaveda, and in the Taittırīya Sambitā and Brāhmana may possibly go back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some of the Upanisads (even from among those that are regarded by most scholars as the earliest ones) may be later than 1000 B. C. Some scholars have criticized me for ascribióg the vedic sambitās to such an early date as 4000 B. C. Time and health permitting, I may have to deal with this question in a separate vork after I finish the 5th and last volume op which I am now

(Sins, expiations and the residual consequences of sins). 

CHAPTER I 

The Article on sin in Hasting's Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics (Vol 11) will clearly show how the idea of sin varies from religion to religion, from age to age and from coun try to country. We are concerned here with the growth and development of the doctrine of sin in India from Vedic times to the medieval digests and commentaries on Dharmaśāstra 

Sin (pātaku) is a word that belongs to the terminology of religion rather than to that of Ethics 1 It is very difficult to dafine sin. In a general way it may be said that it is an act which is regarded as a wilful rebellion against or disobedience of some law supposed to be laid down by God or Revelation; it is opposition to the will of God manifested in an authoritative work or at least failure to abide by the regulations contained therein. 

1 In these days many people, both in the East and the West, ques. tion the very existence of sio As Barbour puts it in his 'Sin and the new Psychology' ( 19) "The feeliag is garding vide acceptaace that there is no such thog as $ıb in the Christian sense. Evil may encompass a man's life and bring disaster to his personality, but it is not so It is psychic evsi that can be explained by psychic causes and perhaps cured by psycho logical therapy and Many say 'nothing is right and nothing is wrong Every thing is the result of complexes. It has resulted in an easy tolerance of sia" Sir Oliver Lodge in his article on Christian Doctrine' in the Hibbert Journal for 1903-4 at p 466 says 'The higher mad of to-day is not worrying about bis sins at all, still less about their punishments His mission, if he is good for anything, is to be up and doing and in so far as he acts wroagły or unwisely he expects to suffer' The followers of Cār vāka who was the prince of Atheists in ancient India used to say 'man should live among pleasures as long as life lasts, he should feed himself sumptu ously (lit, skould drink ghee) even by borrowing money from others There is ao coming again joto the world after the body is reduced to asbes by cremation'. 

Hưstory of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol 

The Rgveda is full of fervent and heart-felt expressions of tlıe sense of sin and betrays intense desire on the part of the sages of old to be free from it The idea of sin in the Rgveda is bound up with the conception of rta. The conception of rta cannot be discussed here in detail But a brief statement is absolutely necessary in order to be able to convey what the Vedic doctrine of sin was 2 

Rta had a threefold aspect It means "the course of nature' or 'the regular and general order in the cosmos'; with reference to sacrifice it means 'the correct and ordered way of the cult of the Gods', and thirdly, it also means the 'moral conduct of man'. A few passages to illustrate these three aspects of rta may be cited here Rg. IV 23 8-10 are3 three verses in which 

the word rta occurs no less than twelve times and which breathe the all-pervading influence of rta throughout the universe *Plentiful waters (or riches or gifts) belong to rta, the thought (or laudation) of rta destroys crooked acts (sins), the brilliant and rousing hymn of praise to rta pierces the benumbed ears of man The props of rta are firm, its (physical) manifestations are many and lovely for the sake of the body (1 e man) Through rta they (people) desire food The cows (sun's rays) entered rta by rta He who wins over rta acquires it For the sake of rta (heaven) and earth are wide and deep, the two high est cows (1 e Heaven and Earth) yield milk (desires or towards) tor the sake of rta' Some other passages are. 'The Sindhus (rivers) follow the rta of Varna' (rtain siudhayo Varunasya yanti, Rg, II 28 4), similarly Rg I 105 12 (rtamarsanti sin dhavah), The whee) of rta (ie the year) revolves round the 

2. For the conception of rta and the idea of sin in the Rgveda the following works may be consulted "The religion of the Veda' by M. Bloomfield (pp 12, 125 ft), "Religion and philosophy of the Veda and Upa mishads' by Prof A, B Keith (pp. 35, 83-85&c.), 'The Vedic idea of sia" by Dr. Henry Lefever (1935) One regrets to observe that Bloomfield's work is marred here and there by a certain levity of thought and expression out of Iceptog with the seriousness of the subject

sky with twelve spokes (dvādaśāram ... Tarvartı cakram pari dyām-Itasya, Rg. I 164 11), the dawr, the daughter of heaven, correctly follows the path of rta ... ...' ('rtasya pad thānam-apveti sādhu', Rg I 124 3); the young woman (Usas) does not destroy (or come in the way of) the light of ļta (Rg I 123 9 ); the sun is the bright and lovely face of rta (Rg VI. 51. 1. 'rtasya suci dargatam-anikam); 'the path of rta became united with the rays' (Rg. I 136 %); 'when exhilarated by drink ing this (Soma) Indra released for the sake of rta the concealed host of cows' (Rg. I 121 4, probably a reference to drought and 

gubsequent rainfall). 

Many of the principal gods of the Vedic pantheon are described as the guardians, promoters or charioteers of rta, Mitra and Varuna rule over all the world by rka (Rg V, 637, rtena visvain bhuvanam vi rājathah); Matra and Varupa, the protectors of rta, occupy a chariot (Rg V. 631), Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman are said to be charioteers of rta (yüyamrtasya rathyah, VII 66 12); they and Aditi and Bhaga are protectors of rta (Rg. VI 51 3) Agni is called 'the charioteer of ļta' (rathi rtasya, Rg. III, 28), the protector of pta, in Rg. 1.18, III 10.2, 4.8.5, X 118.7 and itāvān (in Rg IV.2.1). Soma is styled the protector of rta (in Rig. IX. 48 4, IX 738) and is said to support rta (IX, 97.24 ptam bharat subhrtam carvindub) In Rg. VI. 66.13 the Adityas are said to be rlaran (acting according to the fixed order of nature), tlagāta (sprung from rta) and Itāvrdh (augmenting or rejoicing in rta) and further they are said to be fierce baters of anyta (what is opposed to Ita).' 

Rta is distinguished from sacrifice (yajña). It is not any particular sacrificial rite itself nor the institution of sacrifice, It stands for the ordered course of sacrifice in general In Rg. IV, 3.4. Agni is styled racit (conversant with or observing sta) and is invoked to know the rta (of the sacrifice); in several Fersos we meet with the words 'utena ştam' (e. g. in Rg IV. 3.9 rtena Itam niyatam-illa ā goh', V, 15.2 'stena ştama dharunam dhārayanta yajñasya sāke, V. 68.4 rtam-stena sapantā "conform ing to or joining rta with rta', where "tena' appears to mean the correct course of sacrificial rites and 'rtam' the settled order in the universe. Soma is said to be the thread of ita spread on the datāpairtra (Rg. IX. 73.9 'stasya tantur-vitataḥ pavitra ā). In

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

Rg. I 84.4 it is said ' Indra, drink this (soma) that is extracted ..the streams of the bright (soma) flow towards thee in the seat of rta' (i e, in the sonia sacrifice) Vide also Rg IV 1 13 (asmākam-atra pitaro manusyā abhi pra sedur-rtani-ā susāpāh) 'in this world former men, our ancestors, approached rta etc', Rg I 71 3 (dadhannrtam dhanayannasya dhītim-adidaryo)' Rg. X 67 % (rtam samsanta rju didhyānā yajñasya dhāma prathamam mananta) 'the Angirasas,, declaring the rta and reflecting straightforwardly first thought of the abode of Yaña', Rg. X 371 (malo devāya tad-itam saparyata, 'offer this rta to the great God') 

The conception of rta as a moral imperative occurs in several passages Rg 1. 90 6 (madhu vātā rtāpate madhu ksarantı sındhavah) 'the winds carry sweets, the rivers do the same to him who keeps rta', Rg V 12 % 'O Agni, that knowest rta, know rta alone (in me) I shall not resort to magic either by force or hy duplicity, I shall conform to rta of the reddish bull (1 m of Agni)s; Rg. X 87 11 'O Agoil inay the evil spirit who injures rta by anrta be thrice bound in thy fetters' Yama in rejecting Yami's advances says (Rg X. 10 4) 'What indeed we never did beforo (shall we do it now?); shall we who have spoken rta (so far) now speak anrta ? (rtā vadanto antam rapema) 

In two or three instances sta appears to be almost personifi ed and invoked as a divinity. 'O Agnil for us offer sacrifice to Mitra and Varuna, to the gods and to the great (brhat) rta' (Rg I 75 5). Similarly, in Rg X, 66 4 the great (mahat) rta 18 mentioned alongside of Aditi, Heaven and Earth, Indra, Visou, the Maruts &c. 

Rta and satya were distinguished in several passages of the Rgveda Bor example, Rg. V. 51 2 speaks of the Viśve Devas 28 'rtadhītayah' (whose thoughts were fixed on rta) and 'satyadharmanah'(whose characteristic is truth or whose dharmas are true). In Rg. IX 113,4 rta and satya both occur and appear to mean almost the same thing In Rg X. 190 1 Ita and satya are distinguished as having sprung from 'tapas'. Rta involves a wider conception and satya had originally a restricted mean ing (viz truth or static order). The word aprta, however, is the

Gradually, however, the word rta receded into the back-ground and satya took its place even in Vedic literature, though here and there (as in Tai, Up, II 1 and 1.9.3) both sta and satya ara found in juxtaposition. 

The sages of the Rgveda vere acutely conscious of sin or guilt and pray to the gods, particularly to Varuna and the Adityas, for forgiveness and for being freed from the consequ ences of sin In this connection they employ numerous words such as āgas, enas, agha, durita, dushrla, drugdha, amhas. A few examples of the employment of these words may be cited here. The most frequent vords are āgas and enas, both of whiclı appear to import sin in its deepest and most ethical sense. Rg. VII 86 is a hymn to Varuna in which there are several verses that breathe a deep and heart-felt consciousness of guilt. The sage begins in verse 3 by saying that all wise men of whom ho inquired told him the same thing viz. 'Varuna is angry with you. Then the sage proceeds 'O Varupal what is that great guilt (āgas) (of mine) whereby you desire to injure your worship per and a friend ? Declare that to me, then I shall quickly approach thee with an obeisance and be free from sin (enas). Cast away from us the transgressions (drugdha) of our father and those that we committed in our own person ;...free Vasistha (from guilt) like a calf from the rope (that binds zt). In Rg. VII, 89,5 (almost equal to Atharya-veda VI, 51,3) the sage says 'whatever transgressions (abhidroha) we who are mere men have practised as against the divine hosts and whatever dhar mas laid down by you we may have confounded through our ignorance (or heedlessness) do not destroy us ou account of that guilt (enas).' It will be noticed that in these verses the words agas, ablude oha and enus are employed in the same verses and therefore practi cally inean the same thing. In Rg. II. 27.14 the sage prays 'O Aditil O Mitral O Varunal take pity on us though we may have committed some sin against you', In Rg. II, 28 5 Varuna is implored to loosen sin (agas) from the devotee just like a girdle, Rg. VIII, 45,34 states: 'O Indral do not kill us for one sin, for two sins or three sins or for many (āgas).' In Rg 11, 29.1 the Adityas are implored 'cast away from me sın (āgas) as a woman who gives birth to a child in secret'. For some other passages

Āgas and enas are employed in the same verse, Rg. IV.12.4 'O Agnil Whatever sin (āgas) we may have committed through heedlessness make us free from it before Aditi and loosen from us our sins (enus) from all sides'. 

Some more passages about enas are Rg VI 51 7 'May ve pot have to enjoy (1 o suffer for ) the enas committed by another and Rg VI, 51 8 'Whatever sin be committed by me Ishall remove it by obeisance', Rg VI 743 'O Soma and Rudral Loosen from us and cast away from us whatever sin attaches to our person'; Rg VII 201 'Indra is our saviour even from a great sin'; vide also Rg I 189 1, I, 28 7, VII, 52 2 The word 'aglia', also seems to mean sin 'Apa nah šošucad-agham' (may our sios perish) is the refrain ot Rg. 197.1-8. O gods! May your fetters and may sins (aghān) be far away from us' (11 29 5, in which verse in the first half 'āgah' occurs), X 117 6 (kevalāgho blavatı kevaladi) 'one who simply eats food alone (without offering to others) reaps only sın'. 

Another word is amhas. The following passages may bo cited. In Rg II. 28 6 Varupa is implored 'remove ainhas (sin ) as one removes the rope from the (neck) of the calf; one has not the power even to wink without you (your favour)'? It should be noted that in the preceding verse (D 28 5) already quoted the simile of the girdle is employed with regard to ūgas. 'May Indra take us away from anhas as persons on both sides ( of a river) call one who is going in a boat' (Rg II, 32 14 ), 'No evil caused by the gods or by ren reaches him from any side who Vorships Agai with fuel, oblation or sacrifice'' Rg VIIL 19, 6, 'May Aditi, the mother of the affluent Mitra and Varuna, save us from all sın' (Rg.

(the hearts of men) sins as well as good (thoughts and actions)'10 and it is added that everything though far-off is near to them who are kings. In Rg. II. 27. % the Adityas are called 

avrjināb' (free from vrjina). The Sun is said to maik among men their right and sinful deeds (Rg. IV 1 17). The same words (rju martesu vrjinā ca paśyan) occur in Rg VI, 51, 2 and VII, 60.2 about the Sun. 

The word 'antia' is often used in the Rgveda, It has already been shown how Varuna is said to mark the salya and antia of mon In Rg. VII 60 5 it is said 'these gods, Mitra, Aryaman and Varuna mark (or know) many sins; they flourish in the abode of rta' Rg. VI 66 13 calling Mitra, Varuna and Aryaman haters of anrta has already been quoted (in n. 4). 

The word 'durta' is sometimes used in the sense of sin In Rg I 23 22 the waters are invoked as follows:11 'O waters ! carry away from me whatever sin may exist in me, whatever transgressions I may have been guilty of as regards my sensual appetite or whatever falsehood I may have uttered'. Here all three words 'durita, droha and anrta' are brought together and convey almost the same idea, viz, sin or guilt against the law of the Gods. In Rg I. 185 10 Heaven and Earth are called father and mother and are invoked to save the worshipper from dunta (sin) which involves blame (pātām-avadyād-duritad) 'Avadya' means 'garhya' acc. to Pān. III, 1. 101. Rg. VII, 8%. ry states 'Him neither arnhas (sin) nor durita nor worry reaches from anywhere to whose sacrifice you go, O Mitra and Varuna!. In Rg. X. 126. 1 'amhas' and 'durita' are brought together (na tam-amho na duritam devāso asta martyam) In Rg VII 67 21 the words amhati and lapas 12 seem to be employed in the sense of sin. 'Duskrta' (evil deed) is used in the sense of sin in Rg. VIII, 47, 13 and in Rg X 164, 3 Agni is implored to keep far away from the worshipper all sins 13. The word 'papa' generallyit

XI. 2 7. 19; vide also 15 Ait Br 33, 5 In the Upanisads ‘pāpam' means 'sin' (eg in Tai Up II 9, Chandogya IY 14, 3). Certain important modifications of the doctrine about sin and Karma were introduced in the Upanisads and the Bhagavadgitā, which will be discussed later on. 

In spite of the voluminous references to the consciousness of guilt and sin in the Rgveda and to the transgression of divine lawys briefly indicated above, European scholars were not want ing who boldly affirmed that the idea of sin was altogether unknown to the Rgvedic sagas. Vide S B E vol I p XXII where Mar-Muller replies "the gradual growth of the concept of guilt is one of the most interesting lessons which certain passages of these ancient hymns can teach us!

How sin arises in men's minds 

than these and He makes that man commit bad deeds whom Ho wishes to drag down'.18 Here it appears to be suggested that some men are chosen by God for being saved and some are chosen for being damned. This sounds like the Calvinistic doctrine of pre-destination. In the Bhagavadgita (LII, 36 ) Arjuna questions Srikrsna as follows: 'impelled by whom does a man commit sin as if constrained thereto by force, even though he does not desire to do so'? The answer given is (III. 37) “it is lust and anger springing from the element (muna) of rajas (passion) that are the enemies of man in this world. In another place the Bhagavadgitā (XVI. 21 ) says 'this19 is the three-fold door or entrance to Hell that is ruinous to the self viz, lust, anger and greed; therefore a man must shun these three.' But it must be said that this does not go to the real root of the matter. The question is why should carnal lust, anger or greed themselves arise in the mind of man. The only answer that is indicated is in accordance with the tenets of the Sārkhya philosophy viz. that there are three gunes, sattva, rajas and tamas which combine in various proportions in different men and that it is rajo guna that is the cause of man's sinfulness In the Santi parya, chap. 163, it is stated that there are thirteen very powerful enemies of men beginning with anger (kr odha) and hāma (lust) and it is said that krodha springs from lobha (covet ousness), which latter arises from ignorance (verses 7 and 11). But there is no satisfactory discussion of the origin of ignorance in that chapter. Gautama 19.2 observes20 that 'man in this Torld is polluted by & vile action such as sacrificing for a man unvorthy to offer a sacrifice, eating forbidden food, speaking that ought not to be spoken, neglecting what is prescribed and practising what is forbidden'. Yajñavalkya II. 219 prescribes: 'by

meaning the cause of patana) has been employed as in Āp Dh S. 1721 The Pr V (p 35) paraphrases pataniyānı by 'pātakāni' and derives it from the root 'pat' (patalyanena atı pataniyam) with the addition of the termination 'aniya' according to Pān III 3 113The word occurs also in Yāj II. 210, III, 297, Sankha quoted by Visvarūpa on Yā), III, 237 (10 prose) and other smrtis

Rg VII. 86 6 quoted above (in n 17 ) makes it clear that drinking surā and playing with dice were regarded as sinful. From the Tai. S. II 5 10 %, V 3 12 1-2, Sat Br XII, 3 1 1 and other Brāhmana texts it appears that the murder of a brālimana was generally regarded in early vedic times as the gravest of all sins, though in the Kathaka sambita (31. 7) it is stated that there is no sin as

these actions are not to be styled patanīyas according to Ap, yet they cause impurity which being greater and greater in each succeeding one requires higher and higher penances. Āv adds a few more sinners to those in the Tai, Brviz drdmşupalı (husband of an older sister whose younger sister was married before her), paryāhita (an elder brother before whom a younger brother kindled fires ), pariunvidana (a younger brother who takes his share of the ancestral property before his elder brother ), parunna ( an older brother before whom a younger brother takes away his share of the ancestral property). The Obāndogya Upanisad25 (V. 10. 9.) quotes a verse that declares that the five great sinners are the thief of gold, the drinker of surū, the violator of the guru's bed, the murderer of a brahmapa, and one who associates with any of the preceding four. The Br. Up. (IV. 3. 22) mentions as great sinners the thief and the murderer of a bhruna. 

Coming to the sūtras there is great divergence as to the classification of sins and the enumeration of sins in each class. The Āp. Dh. S, divides sins into two classes viz. pataniya (those that cause loss of caste), asuahara (those that cause imprurity. though no loss of caste is caused). Āp. Dh. S (I.7.21,7-11) states that palaniya sins are theft (of gold), crimes whereby one becomes an ablusasta, complete loss (by neglect) of the Vedic learning that one secured by study, destruction of a foetus, incestuous connection with relations born of the same womb as one's father or mother and with the children of such persons, drinking of sura, intercourse with persons with whom intercourse is for bidden, intercourse with the female friend of one's female guru (mother &c) or with the female friend of one's guru (father &c.) and with the wife of any stranger, constant commission of immoral acts (adhar ma) other than those already mentioned. Ap. Dh $. I. 7.21.10 notes that, according to some, intercourse with a woman who is not the wife of a guru is not a pataniya sin. Among acts which render a man impure are (Ap. Dh, S, I, 7. 21. 12–18) the cohabitation of an Arya woman with sūdras, eating the flesh of forbidden animals such as that of a dog or a human being or village cock or pig or other carnivorous animals, eating the excrement of human beings, partaking of food Jeft by a sūdra, and cohabitation by Arya men with apapātra

women.25 According to some, those acts that are declared to be asuakara are also pataniyas. Āp. Dh, S. (I. 7.21.19) states that acts other than those enumerated are a]so asucikara. Āp. Dh, S. (1. 9. 24.6-9) enumerates those who are ablurśasta, viz, one who slays a person belonging to the first two yarņas (viz, brāhmana and ksatriya) who had studied the Veda or who had been initiated for the performance of a sona sacrifice, one who kills a mare brāhmana (though he may not have studied the Veda or be not initiated for a soma sacrifice), also one who destroys the embryo of a brāhmana even though its sex be undisting uishable, or slays a woman who is an alreyi (in her monthly course). The Vasisthadharmasutra divides 27 sinners into three classes, viz. those who are enasuns, those guilty of mabāpātakas and those guilty of upapatakas (I. 19-23). Among those who are styled enasvinah are those mentioned in Ap. Dh. S. II, 5.12.22, with this difference that the 'brahmojjha', who is included among 'pataniyas' by Ap. Dh. S, 1.7, 21, 9 is put among 'enasvins' by Vasiştha. In Vas. 20.4–12 special prāyaścittas for each of these 'enasvinah' (ordinary sinners) are prescribed. The Mahāpātakas (mortal sids) according to Vasistha are five, viz (violating) a guru's bed, drinking of spirituous liquor, murder of a bhrūna (a learned brahmana), stealing gold from a brāhmaṇa and associating with a patta. Those guilty of upapātakas (minor sins) are: He who forsakes sacred Vedic fires, he who offends a guru, an atheist, he who earns his livelihood from atheists, and he who sells the soma plant. The Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra28 (II, 1) divides sins into pataniya, upapātaka and asucikara. Among the first it cites making voyages by sea, stealing the property of a brāhmaṇa'or misappropriating a deposit, giving false evidence

Classification of sins 

15 

The above statement about the classification of sins and their inclusion among the several classes or 'grades of sids will show that among the early sütra works there was no general agreement about the nature and number of mahāpātakas, upapatakas and other classes of sins, even though as early as the Chandogya Upanisad the mortal sins had been declared to be five. It must be supposed that that Upanisadrepresented only one school of thought in the times of Āp., Baud, and Gaut, who did not entirely accept the tradition of that Upanisad, but followed other divergent ideas. It is impossible to suppose that the verse quoted in that Upanisad is later than the Dharma sūtras of Ap., Gaut, Baud, and Vas 

posed that thing had been dearly as 

ing more to association om also says tha 

It appears that Katyāyana32 divided sinful acts into five classes viz. mahāpāpa (mortal sins), atipāpa (the highest sins than which there is nothing worse), pātaha (sins similar to mahā patakas), prāsangka (due to association for contact) and upapātaka (minor sias). The Bhavisya-purāna also says that those sins that are declared to be equal to mahāpatakas (by Manu and others) are called pātakas Vrddha-Hārsta also (IX. 215-216) speaks of five kinds viz, mahāpāpa, pataka, anupātaka, upapāpa and prakırnaka (miscellaneous) and states (IX, 216–218) that those sins which are said to be like mahāpātaka are pātakas, that anupātakas are sins lesser than patakas, that upapatakas are lesser than patakas and prakīnaka sins are the least sinfu) of all. The Visnudharnasūtra (33 3-5)*speaks of nine kinds of lapses viz. atipātaka, mahāpataka, anupataka, upapataka, jātıbhrariisakara (effecting loss of caste), sankarīkarapa, (Tendering one as degraded as a man of a mixed caste), apātri karana (renderiog the perpetrator unworthy of receiving a gift), malāvaha (causing defilement) and prakīrpaka (miscellaneous). Atipatakas, acc. to Visbu Dh, S 34.1, are sexual intercourse with one's mother, daughter or daughter-in-law and the only expiation for them is entering fire. Manu omits the separate mention of atipātaka and anupātaka and includes most of them under those that he designates as equal to one of the fovr well known mahāpātakas. Katyāyana quoted in the Prāyaścitta muktāvali of Divākara (folio 3 a) adds sexual intercourse with one's sister as atipātaka to the three mentioned by Visnu

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

Harita Dh. S (it appears) quoted by the Mit knew33 of a variety of patakas called anupātaka, but from the way in which the several patakas are arranged it looks as if atıpātaka in Harita was a lesser sin than mahāpātaka Manu (in chap XI) refers to all the kinds of pātakas found in the Visnu-dharmasūtra except atipātakas Usually five mahāpātakas have been enumerated from the days of the Chāndogya Up (quoted on p. 12) viz brābmana murder, drinking spirituous liquor, theft (generally understood as theft of brāhmana's gold), sexual intercourse with the wife of a guru and association with the perpetrators of any of these four (for a year34) Vide Vas I 19-20, Manu XI 55, 180, Yā; TII, 227, 261), Visnudharmsūtra 35 1-5, Vrddha-Hārsta IX 174. Manu mentions certain sins as equal to Mahāpatakas which are styled anupatakas by the Vispudharmasūtra chap. 36 The most elaborate treatment of all kinds of sins in the amrtis is found in Manu, Yāj and Visnu There is difference of opinion even among these three on certain points For example, Manu35 XI. 56 says that forgetting the Veda, reviling the Vedas, giving false evidence, slaying a friend, eating forbidden food and food that is unfit for eating or should not be eaten, are lapses similar to drinking surā; while Yā. IIT, 228 states that three out of these (viz reviling the Vedas, slaying a friend and forgettirg the Veda studied by a person) along with the reviling of a guru by attri buting false faults are similar to the murder of a brālmana. The result is that there is an option as to the expiation to be prescribed for these sins,

Details of Mahāpūlakas 

It would be desirable to give some details as regards each of the makāpātakas and then to describe the other varieties of sins and then to set out the expiations prescribed for all of them, It should be noted that both the secular law of penalties and the ecclesiastical rules about expiations made a difference between a sinful act intentionally committed ( hānatah) and one com mitted through ignoranca or besdlessness and between an act done only once ( sakrt) or dono repeatedly (asakti) 

Brahmahalya Halyā or vadha (killing) is applied to an act which immediately or after some time results in causing loss of life directly without the intervention of any other cause.36. The Agnipurāna (173 1), the Mit, the Prāyaścittaviveka ( 47 ) and other works define what is meant by vadha A man may be the cause of the death of a brāhmana in five ways, viz, he may himself kill (i e, he becomes the kartā), he may incite another to kill (prayojaka) by ordering that other to do so (as a king or noble by ordering his servant) or by imploring another to kill and giving advice about the killing, he may encourage another to kill by his own approval (anumanta), or by helping the killer when he wavers or by offering protection to the killer against others (anugrahaka ) and by becoming a ninutta, 37 

The Mit on - Yaj. II. 227 and 243 ( quoting verses from Paithinasi) explains all these at length. For the definition of anugrāhaka it relies on a verse of Manu "Where many persons are armed and have a coinmon purpose in view, if even one of them kills a person, all of them are guilty of murder, which is very much like sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. This distinc tion into several degrees of killers is an ancient one and is based on Āp Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 1-% 'He who78 instigates, be who approves, and he who commits an act-these share its results in heaven and hell; but be amongst these who contributes most to

Killing a brālimana

milk of a kapilā (dark-brown) cow in the case of śūdras. If a brahmana or any other human being or a cow diod while a competent doctor was administering treatment to them by means of drugs, oils or food, or cauterization by cutting or by opening a vein the medical man incurred no sin 13 But if a quack pre tending to know medicine administered such treatment and death followed, Yay. II. 242 prescribed various punishments, If a brāhmana administers moderate corporal punishnient to his son, pupil or wife for some fault and the son or pupil or wife suddenly dies he incurs no sin, according to the Bhavisyapurāna and the Agnipurana.4 Gautama (IT 48-50), Ap. Dh S I % 8. 29-30, Manu VIII, 299-300(=Matsyapurāna 227. 152-154), Visnu Dh. $ 71 81-82, Nārada (abhyupetyāgušrūşā 13-14) lay down that the punishment should be administered with a rope or bamboo slip on the back (but never on the head or chest) and Manu (VIII 300) provides that if these restrictions were violated the punisher would incur the same guilt or punishment as a thief. Vide H. of Dh, vol II. pp 362-363 for this topio 

One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieval Dharmaśāstra writers is whether a man can kill a brāhmana ātatāyin in self-defence without incurring any sin or punishment by the king. There is great divergence of views on this point, which has been dealt with at some length in H of Dh vol I pp. 148–151 and vol. III pp. 517-518. The conclusion of the Mitaksarā appears to voice the views of most writers that, if a brāhmana comes as an atatayin (as an incendi ary, as a poisoner, as a kidnapper of women or with the inten tion of killing or wresting a field), then in self-defence one may oppose him without incurring any sin, but that if the brāhmana offender meets death though the defender did not desire to kill him (but only to stop him by causing injury short of death), the

History of Dharmatūstra - I voli defender is not liable to be punished by tle king and he has to undergo a light expiation (i, e, he is not guilty of brāhmana's murder). 45 

Surāpāna (drinking of suā) has beon lield to be a maha. pātaka The word surā occurs several times in the Rgveda (e g. Rg I 116 7, 1. 191.10, VII, 86 6, VIII.2 12, X 1079) Rg. VII. 86 6 quoted above (in note 17) clearly indicates that sura was looked upon by the Rgvedic singers as a cause of sin just as much as gambling Rg. I 1167 (satam kumbhān asiñcatam surāyah) road with Rg I 117.6 (satam madhūnām) implies that madhu (honey or some sweet substanca) might have been used in preparing surā Soma svas a beverage to be offered to the gods and to be drunk by the brāhmana priests and was sharply distinguished from surā (o & in Tai S II 5 11, Vāj S. 197, Śat Br. V.1 5 28). The last furnishes the striking antithesis 'soma is truth, prosperity, light, and surā is untruth, misery, darkness'. It appears that long before the Kathaka Sambitā brāhmanas had come to regard the drinking of sura as very sinful [ XII 12 'therefore the brāhmapa does not drink surā (with the idea) that (by drinking it) he may become affected by sin') 46 The Chandogya Up. (V. 10.9) speaks of the drinker of surā as a patita, while in V.11 5 king47 Aśrapati Kaikeya makes the boast before the five learned brābmanas that had come to him for the knowledge of Alman Varšvānara that in his kingdom there was no thief and no drinker of madya. Though Manu XI 54 enumerates the drinking of surā among the five mahāpātakas, Vā). III. 227 speaks of the madyapa (drinker of madya) as one of the five great sinners. Therefore we must explain what is meant by surā and when surāpāna becomes a mahāpātaka. By Manu XI, 93 surā is said to be the refuse of food and Manu XI. 94 states that surū is of three kinds, viz that prepared from iolasses, that from flour and that from madhūka flowers (or from honey). There is a great deal of discussion about surā in many of the digests and the propositions

Drinking of sura 

established by most of them are 8: (1) that all the three higher varnas are forbidden to drink the surā preparad from flour and drinking it is a grave sin (mahāpataka) in the case of anyone belonging to the three first yarpas, (2) All intoxicants (madya) are forbidden to brāhmanas at all stages of life (Gaut. II. 25 'madyam nityam brāhmanal' and Āp. Dh, S, I 5. 17-21); but a brālimana drinking surā of the gaudi or mādlyi kind would not ba guilty of mahāpātaka but of anupataka (acc to Vispu); (3) that intoxicants other than surā prepared from flour are not con demned for ksatriyas and Faišgas; (4) the sūdra was not for bidden to drink any kind of intoxicant (including surā made from flour); (5) brahmacārins of all varnas studying the Veda had to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. The Vispu Dh. S. (22 83-84) specifies ten kinds of madya (intoxicants) prepared from dates, jack fruit, cocoanuts, sugarcane &c and Pulastya quoted by the Mit on Yāj. III. 253, by the Prayascittaprakarapa of Bhavadera ( 40), the Prāyaścittaviveka of Sūlapāni (p. 90), Pr. Prakāsa (folio 69 b) refers to eleven kinds of madyas apart from surā (dyādaśam to surāmadyam sarvesam adhamam smrtam). Vide H of Dh. vol. III pp 964-966 for further disous sion on intoxicating drinks, 

all variads. TheantsPulastra 

The Mit points out (on Yāj III, 253) that the prohibition against drinking surā applies to boys who have not yet been in Fested with the sacred thread and also to unmarried girls, since Manu XI 93 makes no distinction of sex but only forbids to the three first castes the drinking of surā and since the Bhavisyapurāna49 expressly forbids to a brāhmada female the drinking of surā The Kalpataru appears to have held otherwise, But a woman and a minor had to undergo lesser prāyascitta as will be shown below. Vas 21 11 and Yāj III 256 state that the wife of a brahmana, ksatriya or vaiśya who drinks surā (made from flour)would not reach the worlds of her husband and she

Drinking surū means taking it down the throat Thero fore if a man's lips only touch surā or if surā enters his mouth but he spits it out, then there is no drinking of surā (i, e no mahāpātaka) and he would have had to undergo in such a case a light expiation for the touch of surā52. 

Steya (theft). In order to constitute theft as a grave sin according to the commentaries the theft must be of a brāhmada's gold of a certain quantity Steya is defined by Ap DhS I 1028 1 ass"a man becomes a thief by coveting another's property (and taking it) in whatever situation he 

may be (without the owner's consent)' Katyayana. (810) defines54 it as 'depriving a man of his property, whether clandestinely or openly and, whether by night or by day, is known to be theft'. Vyāsa defines it similarly. Vācaspati in his bhāsya on Yogasūtra IT. 30 defides steya as taking property from another in a manner that is not allowed by the śāstras (steyam asāstra-pūryakam dravyānām paratah švīkaranam). Though Manu (XI 54) and Yaj (III 227) simply employ the word 'steya' (theft) or 'stena' (thief) yet in speaking of the prayascitta

Steya as Mahapātaka 

for steya Manu (XI, 99 'suvardasteyakrt) and Yaj. I, 257 (brāhmanesvarbahari) add the qualification that he should be a thief guilty of stealing gold (from a brālımapa, acc. to Yāj ). Vas, 20. 41 and Cyavana (q by Pr V. p. 117) mention 'brāhmana suvarda-harana' as a mahāpataka and the Samaridhāra Br. (I, 6.1) also employs the words brāhmadasyam brtvā'. Vide Samvarta 122 and Viśvāmitra (q. by Pr. V. p. 108). A further qualification was added by Visvarūpa (on Yāj III. 25% 'anākhyāya &c), the Mit. (on Yāj. II. 257), the Madana pārijāta (pp 827-28), Prayascittaprakarana (P. 72), the Prayascittaviveka ( 111) and other commentators that the gold stolen must be at least sixteen māsas in weight, otherwise there is no mahāpatakas. So, if a man steals gold belonging to a brahmana which is less than 16 māsas or steals gold of any weight (even more than 16 māsas) from a non-brāhmana (i, e. from a ksatriya or the like) he would be guilty only of a minor sin (upapātaka). The Mit relies on the verses of Yaj. I 362-363 for the technical meaning of suvarna (as 16 māsas) There was no guilt of theft acc. to Vārsyāyani if (Ap. Dh, S, I 10. 28.2) a person took only a small quantity of cereals ripening in pods (such as mudga, maşa and gram) or took grass for his oxen while he was going in a cart.56) According to Gautama 12.25 a man may take (without permission and without incurring the guilt of theft) for the sake of cows and for the sake of śraula or smārta fires grass, fuel and flowers of trees and plants as if they were his own property and the fruits (of trees and plants) that are not fenced around. Manu VII, 339 (=Matsya 227. 112-113) is almost Jike Gaut 12.25 and Manu VII, 341 adds that a traveller of the three higher castes may, if his provisions have run short, tako (without fear of punishment) from another's field two sugarcane stalks and two mülakas (esculent roots). 

Gurvanganāganah (sexual intercourse with the wife of the guru). Manu (X1,54) employs this word, while Yāj. II, 227 and Vas. 20.13 speak of the offender as gurutalpaga (who violates the bed of the guru) and Vas. I. 20 mentions the sin as 'gurutalpana

(III, 233) where there is an express extension of the sin of gurutalpagamana to intercourse with one's teacher's wife, or one's daughter and other nearly related women. This would have been unnecessary if gur utalpa was primarily meant to include the teacher's wife; while the Pr. V. relies upon Gaut.

S, 31.1-2 three persons are atrgurus (exceed even guru in their greatness) viz. the mother, the father and the ācārya and Devala who mentions eleven parsons as gurus. The Pr. M, does not seem to be quite correct since the Pr. V. ultimately (pp. 134-135) states its final view that guru here means only the father and not the acārya and others and that Vispu Dh.

History of Dharmaśāsti a 

(Vol. 

of nine kinds of satsarga (contact or association) out of which the first five were treated as light sins, but the other four were serious viz, Occupying the same bed or seat, taking food in the same row with the sidner, cooking food in the sinner's cooking pots or partaking of food prepared by him, being his sacrificial priest or employing him as one's sacrificial priest, being the sinner's teacher of the Veda or employing him as one's teacher of the Veda, sexual intercourse, taking food with him in the same pot. The Pr Prakasa (folio 74a) holds that samsarga is of three kinds, the highest, middling and lovest. The first includes four viz. yonisambandha (marriage), srauva ( 

ie that due to sacrificing for a sinner or making him a priest), maulcha (about learning or teaching Veda) and eating of food from the same vessel (ekāmatrabhojana), the middling is of five kınds viz. using the same vehicle, seat, bed or coverlet, eating in the same row and learning the Veda together ( sahadhyayana) The lowest is of various other kinds such as intimate talks, touching, cooka ing food in the same vessel, eating food at his house, receiving a gift from him &c Adhyāpana in order to be a great sin must relate to the Veda, and so also yājana must relate to such Vedic sacrifices as Darbapūrpamāsa, Caturmāsya, Agajstoma Helping & mahāpatakin to perform the five daily yajñas or teaching him the angas (metrics, grammar etc.) and the śāstras is only a minor sin. Parāgara62 (XII. 79) states that sins are transferred (or spread) from man to man like a drop of oil on vater by sitting or sleeping together or by using the same conveyance or by speaking with or dining in the same row. Devala and Chāgaleya q, by the Mit, on Yāj. VII 261, the Pr. Prakarana (p. 101), the Pr. V. (p. 145), the Par M. (II. part 1. p 28) and others contain similar Yerses. Acc. to Pr. Prakāśa (folio 75a), in order to become palita one must simultaneously practice these four together, if practised separately, there is no pārtya but only dosa. Parāsara (I. 25-26) states that in the Krta age a man became pauta by speaking with a palita, in Tretā by touching him, in Dvāpara by partaking of food prepared in his house and in Kali by actually committing a sinful act and that in tha Krta age a district was abandoned (if any one therejn became patuta), in Tretā the village, in Drāpara the family of the patta was abandoned) and in Kali only the actual perpetrator himself (18

abandonsd as palita). It is clear from this that such contacts with a patita as speaking with him,63 touching him or eating food (in the house of a patita) were not regarded as involving a man in the same sin as that of the actual perpetrator. Speak ing, touching and eating are also actions (karman) and Parāśara did not include them in the word 'karmanā' which Tefers only to the actual perpetration of a murder, surāpana etc. Therefore when some writers include such contacts as eating or touching under "karmana' they put two meanings on the ' word karman in Parāśara viz. perpetration of a murder or the like and also doing some of the acts (touching, eating) which are forbidden to be done in reference to a perpetrator by somo 'smrtis. This is a procedure which is against the maxim of the Mimāmsā that the same word conveys only one sease in the game context The reasonable inference from the words of Parāśara is that merely touching a mahāpātakın or eating food in his house did not involve the toucher and eater in patutya. In spite of this medieval writers gradually extended the scope of samsarga in a spirit of exclusiveness and of over-emphasis on ideas of ceremonial purity - For example, the Sinţtyarthasara 65 (p. 112) remarks that he who associates with the person that associates with a malāpātakin has to undergo half the expiation that the first associator has to undergo. But that work does not go beyond this. The Mit. (on Yāj III. 261) appears to hold that the associator even though he does not be como patita is liable to undergo expiation and that even the 4th and 5th associators in a series are liable to undergo expiation

though it is lesser and lessers. The Pr. Prakarana (p 109), Pr V. (pp 169-170) and the Pr T. (p 547) quote certain verses of Āpastamba and Vyāsa which very much widen the circle of samsarga. Apastamba-sporti67 (II, 1-3) states, 'if a cāndāla stays in the house of any one of the four castes without being kuown, the latter on coming to know of the fact should undergo expiation, which is Cāndrāyana or Parāka for a member of the first three vardas and Prājāpatya for a sūdra, Those who partook of cooked food in that man's house should undergo Krochra; one should prescribe one half of Kșochra for those who took cooked food in the house of the 2nd associator and for those who partook of cooked food in the house of these last one fourth of Krochra is piesci abed'. So besides the oliginal associator three more in succession were held to be liable for prayas citta. Mercifully they stopped at the 4th from the original associator A few writers took a more reasonable view. The Par M (II part3, p 90) remarkss that Parasara did not prescribe any expiation for samsar ga (with those guilty of grave sins) with the idea that in the Kali age

there is no blenish of samsarga and that it is ou account of this that in the enumeration of things to be avoided or not allowed in the Kali age (Kalz-varjya) another smrti includes 'pollution through contact with a sinner' (as a Kalivariya). The Smrtimuktaphala (Prayascitta. pp. 897-98) echoes the very words of Madhava and quotes further authorities on the point69. The Nirdayasindhu holds that though there is blame in association with a patra the associator does not himself become pattta. As Yaj III. 261 employs the word 'vatsaram' and as the accusative of time is, acc. to Panini, to be used only when there is 'atyantasamyoga' of time and space (distance ) it follows that the associator who is to undergo penance for contact must have been day and night in contact for a year, Devala employs the word 'sārvakālıkam' in this connection, 

Though many crimes do not in so many words come within the words of the definitions of the mahāpātakas the smrtis extend by analogy the saine condemnation as the mahapatakas in three ways. For example, Yaj. III. 251 expressly states that one who kills a ksatriya or Yaibya engaged in (soma) sacrifice or a foetus or an atreyi woman has to undergo the same expiation as for brāhmana murder (therefore this is vācanikütideśa). Yay. III. 232-233 extends the sin of gui utalpa-gamana to intercourse with several near female relatives (such as mother's or father's sister), This is extension by tādrūpya. The smrtis declare many actions as equal to ( sama) mahāpātakas in general or as equal to one of the mahāpātakas, This is alıdeśa by sāmya. A few words must be said on this topic. The general rule is that the expia tion for those lapses that are declared to be equal to a mabāpātaka is less than (i. e. half of) what would be prescribed

[Vol. for the mahāpataka itself!. And the penance for those that come under atrdeśa of the vacanika or tādrūpya kind is three fourths of that for the mahāpātaka itself. But it has to be noted - that there is divergence of views about these in the sūtras and the smrtis Acc, to Gaut 21.10 giving72 false evidence, backbiting about another's guilt that will reach the king, falsely accusing one's guru with a grave sin or crime are equal to malāpātaka. Ini Manu XI 55 (=Agnipurāna 168. 25) the last two of these three and false statement about one's caste or learning or family (1 e. . saying that one is a brālimana whep one is not) for securing pro sparity or eminenca are stated to be equal to brāhmapa's murder. Acc to Yaj. III 228 falsely charging one's guru is equal to brahmahatyā aod false statement about one's caste or learning is equal to drinking surā (Vā). III 229), while acc, to Visou Dh. S 37.1-3 the three sins mentioned in Manu XI, 55 are to be in cluded among minor sins (upapalakas), while giving false evid ence is declared by Visou to be equal to drinking sura (36.2). No useful purpose would be served by dilating at great length on the divergences of smrtis on what lapses are equal to one of the Mahāpatakas. The digests explain that where the same lapse is described as equal to surāpāna by one smrti and as equal to brāhmana-murder by another the idea is that there is an option as to the penance prescribed for that lapse. There fore only the remarks of Manu and Yaj. will be set out hero. Manu XI. 56 (=Agnipurāna 168, 26 ) prescribes that forgetting the Veda ( already studied ), reviling the Vedas, giving false evidence, killing a friend, eating forbidden food or food that should not be eaten, these sis are equal to surāpāna. Vide Yāj III 228 already referred to above. Manu XI. 57 holds that stealing a deposit or a man or horse or silver or land or diamonds and other gems is equal to the theft of brahmana's gold. Yaj. III, 230, Visnu Dh S. 5 383, Agni purāna 168. 27 ara to the same effect. Aco to Manu XI. 58 ( Agnipurāna 168 28 ) carnal intercourse with a sister by the same mother, with maidens, with females of the lowest castes (like Candālas), with the wife of a friend or son is declared to

be equal to the violation of a guru's bed. Yāj. II, 231 is practically the same (but he adds intercourse with a sagotra woman to the list). Gaut. 23.12 and Mapu XI. 170 are very similar. Yāj. III, 232-233 declare that a man who has sexual intercourse with a sister of his father or mother, with his maternal uncle's wife, with his daughter-in-law, with a co-wife of his mother, with his sister, with the daughter or wife of his Vedic teacher or his own daughter, is guilty of being a violator of the guru's bed and should have his penis cut off and be killed (by the king) and the woman concerned, if she was a willing party, should also be killed, Nārada (stripunsayoga, verses 73–75)73 states: "If a man has sexual intercourse with any of these women viz. mother, mother's sister, mother-in-law, maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, a wife of the paternal uncle or of a friend or of a pupil, a sister, sister's friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of one's Vedic teacher, a woman of the same gotra, one who has come for protection, a queen, an ascetic woman, one's wet-nurse, a woman performing a vrata and a brāhmana woman, he becomes guilty of the sin of the violator of the guru's bed (i. e, incest). For that crime zo other punishment is laid down except that of the cutting of the penis." These two, Yāj. and Nārada, show that excision of the organ and death are both the expiation and the punishment for this crime. The Mit. (on Yāj II, 233) adds that this punish ment applies only to the offenders other than a brāhmana, since Manu (VIII, 380) prescribes that a brāhmada offender should not be punished with death whatever sin or crime he niay have committed and that he is to be banished from the country unhurt and is to retain all his wealth. The Vispudharma-sūtra (36.4-77) adds a few more women to the list of Yaj and Narada (such as a woman in her monthly illness, the wife of a learned brāhniana or of one's sacrificial priest or of one's Upadhyāya).

List of upapātakas 

IV) 

The above list, though long, is not thoronglily exllaustive Vas I 18 quoted above mentions several persons as enasiinoh ( who acc. to Visvarūpa on Yāj III, 229-236 are upapātakinah), some of whom (such as one who is asleep when the sun rises ol sets) are not included by Yaj, in his list of upapatakas. Thougli almost all of the upapātakas listad by Yāj occur in Manu ( XI 59-66 ), yet some of them such as "abhicāra' (per forming a sacrifice like Syenayāga for the destruction of an enemy ), 'mūlakarma' (employment of herbs for bringing under one's control & person) are not poted by Yāj The Mit on Yāj. III, 24% observes that some upapātakas if rapeatedly indulged in make a man patita (as provided by Gaut 21.1) Višvarūpa, there fore, derives upapātaka as one 'that may become a pataka by constant addition (upacaya) or by constant practics' (upetya85). 

Manu XI. 67 (=Agnipurāna 16886, 37-38) and Vispu Dh, S. 38 1-6 mention certain lapses as 'Jatiburamsakara' ( that cause the loss of caste ) viz giving pain to a brālmapa (by means of a stick or by the hand), smelling things which ought not to be smelt at (such as garlic, ordure &c.) and smelling spirituous liquor, cheating (saying one thing and doing another), an unnatural offence with a man or beast also, aco to Visau) According to Manu XI 68 (=Agnipurana 168 38-39), killing a donkey, a horse, a camel, a deer, an elephant, a goat, sheep, fish, a snake or a buffalo must be known to be sankarikarana (reducing one to a mixed caste). Visou 29, 1 says that sankarikarapa is the killing of village of forest animals, Manu XL. 69 holds that accepting presents from condemned men (such as those mentioned in Manu IV. 84), trading, serving sūdras and speaking a falsehood make & man unvorthy to receive gifts (apatrikarana). The Visnu. Dh. S. 40.1 adds 'maintaining one's self by usury' to these. Manu XI. 70 prescribes that killing insects, small or large, or birds, eating any thing kept close to spirituous liquors, stealing fruits, fuel and flowers and unsteadiness of mind are malāvaha (which make a man impure). Visou Dh. S. 41. 1-4 are similar. Vispu Dh, S. 42, 1 says all other lapses not specifically mentioned in

Having dealt at length with several classes or grades of sins, we have now to address ourselves to the question of the consequences of sins and the means recommended or adopted for removing sin and its consequences. 

It has already been shown above how the sages of the Rgveda prayed to the gods, particularly to Aditi, Mitra, Varupa, the Adityas and Agni to free them from agas or enas eto. They often say that they violated the dharmas or the valas (ordinances) of the gods and imploie forgiveness They were afraid of the consequences of their guilt, viz. the god's apger, They thought that when God was angered by their transgres sions he smote them with "adversity, destruction, disease and death. For example, they prey 'whatever ordinance (vrata) of yiyurs we may violate every day like subjects in the case of a king's ordinances) do not subject us to your death-dealing blow' (Rg I 25 2), 'O Varunal whatever transgression we men have committed towards the divine host and whatever rules of yours wo may have confounded through heedlessness, do not, on

account of that sin (enas),' strike us down' (Rg. VII. 89.5)88 In Rg X 89.8-9 it is said that Indra hurls his sharp and deadly Teapon at those who break the settled order (dbarman) of Mitra, Varuna and Aryaman. The gods are implored to save the worshipper from the deadly attacks of the wolf and from sinking into a pit (in adversity) in æg. II, 29.6. In Rg. IX. 73.8 it is said that the wise God has his eye on all worlds and he pierces in pits those who do not observe his ordinances and who are therefore not liked by him89. On the other hand, when God is pleased with the worshipper, he is implored to lead the latter by the path of vi tue (Rg. I 189.1), to confer happiness on the wor shipper's offspring (Rg I. 189 %, IV, 12.5) and to bestow wealth on bim (Rg VII. 45 40). 

In the Rgveda the first means of removing the consequences of sin appear to be prayers for mercy and for the remission of sin as in Rg. VII. 86.4-5, VIL 88, 6–7, VIL 89.1-4 (where 'mflā suksatra mrlaya' is the refrain of all four verses). Even in the Rgveda water Tas supposed to remove sin, e g. I. 23. 22 says 'O water! carry away whatever sin(durata)may exist in pe'. This shows that sin was supposed to have physical effects like a disease, which Tere removed by water, Sacrifices were offered to the gods in order to win their favour and in order that the sacrificer may be freedoo from the consequences of even grave sins. The Tai S. V. 3.12 1-2 and the Sat. Br. XIII, 3, 1. 1 (S. B. E, VOL. 44 p. 328) state that the gods redeemed themselves from all sin by means of this (Aśramedha sacrifice), they even redeemed themselves from the sin of brāhmapa murder. That a confession of sin was deemed to remove sin is illustrated in a striking way by what happened in the Varupapraghāsa (one of the cāturmāsya sacrifices). In thato sacrifice the wife of the sacrificer had to confess whether she had any lovers and if she felt ashamed to

S III 44 and was allowed to take further part in the sacrifice If she con cealed the truth, it was stated in the Tai. Br that evil would be. fall her near and dear relatives (her son or husband). It is said by many European scholars who have written on the religion of the Veda that sacrifice became a sort of magic rite to wrest from gods or independently of them what the worshipper desired (eg, see Keith's Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads pp. 260-268) 92 But this is an over-statement When initiated for a sacrifice the sacrificer and his wife had to observe a fast or live on a low diet, both were called upon to observe many strict rules such as telling the truth, they had to make large preparations and spend wealth on the materials and the fees to the priests, These things were deemed to cleanse the mind and soul of the taint of sin. There is no reason to suppose that it was only the ritual that was thought to bring about the desired result (and not all the other matters referied to above). 

We shall now discuss the prescriptions of the sūtras and smrtis about the consequences of sins. 

In this connection the doctrines of Karma and Purarjanma must be well remembered The details of the origin and develop ment of those doctrines will be discussed in a later section, Here it is enough to state the few main propositions of the doctrine of Karma The fundamental proposition is that cause and effect are as inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad act leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences at once or in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past bad deeds The theory of karma and

IV) 

Rarma and punarjanma 

the theory of transmigration of souls (of pre-existence and post-existence) are inextricably mixed up in Indian thought from at least the ancient times of the Upanisads. The general rule is that Karma, whether good or evil, cannot be got rid of, except by enjoying or undergoing its consequences. This is said by Gaut. 19. 5, Markandeya-purāna and many other works. 'Because the deed does not perish' Gaut. 93; 'whatever human action it may be, whether good or evil, it cannot be got rid of except by enjoying its consequences; know from me that a man gets rid of good and evil deeds by enjoying their con sequences)'. This doctrine is based on the Sat. Br. V, 22.27, Br. Up IV. 4 and VI. 2, Chān, Up. III, 14, and V, 3–10, Katha 5. 6-7 and other Upanisad texts. 

Therefore they say, 'a man is born again in that world for which he has worked.' 'According as a man acts and accord ing as he believes so will be be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that a person consists of desires And as is his desire, so is his will; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap' (Br. Up. IV. 4, 5); 'a man is made up of will; whatever he wills in this world the same he becomes after departing from this world' (Chān. Up. I, 14, 1); 'some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence; others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge' (Katha Up. 5, 7). 94 

'Actions done by a man do not perish unless they (i e, their consequences) are enjoyed even after crores of years, (the fruits of) actions whether good or evil must of necessity be enjoyed95,"

just as a calf finds out its own mother from among thousands of Cows, so actions done in a former life unerringly reach the parpetrator thereof.' 

But this general principle pas modified in various ways by the smrtis and later writings. Gautama 19.1196(=Vasistha 22.8) states. 'Reciting the Veda jnaudibly (Japa), austerities, a saciifice, fasting and giving gifts are the means of expiating that (i e, a blamable act)' Vas, 20. 47 and 25. 3 lay down 'A. sinner is freed from sin by tormenting his body, by austerities, by reciting the Veda and also by making gifts' and 'those who are constant ly engaged in prānāyāmas (suppression and regulation of breath), raciting purificatory texts, giving gifts, offering sacrifices, muttering sacred texts 'will undoubtedly be freed from sing'. Manu III, 227 observes. 'by confession, by repentance, by austerity, by reciting Vedic texts (sacred Gāyatri or other texts), a sinner is freed from guilt and in case of difficulty (i, e. if he is unable to perform austerities or to recite Vedic texts) by liberality'. Similar provisions occur in Parāsara X, 40, Sātātapa T, 4, Samvarta 203, Harita (q, in Pr. T. p 467), Yama, (q. in Pr. V. pp 30, 31 ), Bhavisyapurāna (q. by Pr. V. p. 31 ) 

Before proceeding with the subject of prāyaścittas we shall speak briefly about the other means of reducing the con sequences of sin And first comes confession With reference to tlie confession of paramours by the wife in the Varunapraghāsa, the Tai. Br. (I. 6. 5. 2)97 says 'He makes the wife confess, there by he renders her pure and then he leads her to penance'. The Sat. Br. (II. 5. 2. 20) puts it in this form 'for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes tluth'. This was a confession before God (Fire) and men (the priests ) to restore one to divine forgiveness and favour As regards several lapses, confession was part of the procedure prescribed for atoning for the sin,

Confession-In Āp. Dk S. 1. 9. 24. 15, 1. 10. 28. 19, 1. 10.29. 1 it is prescribed that the parson undergoing a penance for being an ablešasta or for unjustly forsaking his wife or for the murder of a learned brāhmana has to declara his misdeed while begging for alus to support himself. The Vedic student who was guilty of sexual intercourse had also to proclaim his lapse while begging at seven houses (Gaut, 23.18, Manu XI 122 ) 98 

Repantance (anutāpa)ManuXL 229-230 (=Vispudharn ołtara II. 73 231-32 ) provide: "The more a inan's mind loathes his own evil deed the more does his body become freed from the unrighteousness (comınitted by him). If after committing a sin a man feals repentance for having done it he becomes free from that sin. He becomes purified only by the resolution of ceasing to sin and thinking 'I shall not do so again". 100 The Vispupurāpa II. 6.40 lays emphasis on repentance and humble devotion to Krspa. Pr. V, (p. 30 ) quotes a verse of Angiras 'A man after committing sins, if he is consuined by repentance and is sorry day and night (for his misdeed), is purified by prānāyāma'. The view of digests like the Pr. Prakasa is that 

98 Confession of sins has played a prominent part in early and medie val Christianity. For example, (First epistle on) Joho I. 9 says "If we confess our sias, he is farthéal and just to forgive us our sigs and cleause us from all uprighteouspess'.

the periods for which tapas is to be observed are a year, six months, four months, three months, two months, one (month), 24 days, 12 days, 6 days, 3 days, a day and a night, (according to the nature of the sin). Manu XI. 239-2-41 declare that those guilty of mahāpātakas and others guilty of evil deeds are freed from sins by well-practised tapas and that whatever sins are committed by people in thought, word and bodily actions are all quickly burnt by tapas This doctrine is shared by th: Jainas as stated in the Uttaradhyayana XXIX 27 'by austerities he cuts off karman' (S B. E. vol 45 p. 166). 

Homa (sacrifice into fire). The Tai. A. (II 7-8) describes 102 the küsmānda homa and diksā and II. 8 prescribes that the man who regards himself as impure should offer a sacrifice with the küsmānda mantras (mentioned in Tai Ā. II3-6, viz. 'yaddeva deya-bedanam' (Vaj. S 20 14-16-Tai. A. II 3.1) The Mahārpava karmavipāka (folio 8 a) prescribes the procedure of Kūsmānda homa taken from Jawadagni which is brief. It is as follows.“ After shaving the hair on the head and the moustache and taking a bath in holy water one should offer the ajyabhāgas and then offer oblations of clarified butter with the three Anuvākas beginning with 'yad deyā deyahedanam,' and then he worships fire with the verses beginning with Vaisyanaraya pratipā dayani' He then offers samıdh with the mantra yadadiya. yam' and then he repeats the Jayā mantras. He has to observe the rules for a diksita viz not eating flesh, avoiding sexual intercourse, not telling a falsehood and not sleeping on a cot. He has to subsist on milk (if he is a brāhmana), on barley gruel if a ksatriya and on āmiksā if he is avaisya, The Küsmanda-homa as prescribed by Baudhāyana is a longer one The Baud, Dh. S. II. 71 prascribes that he who considers himself impure should offer burnt oblations reciting the kūsmānda mantras, that he who has had forbidden intercourse becomes even like a thief or even like a slayer of a learned brāhmada

and that (by performing homa with kūsmāndas) he becomes free from any sin that is less than the murder of a learned brahmana Ya) IIT, 309 provides that whenever a twice-born man feels himself mixed up in heavy sins he should perform a homa with sesame with the sacred Gāyatri manira. The Mit following a verse of Yama says that one lakh of offerings of sesame must be made. Both Manu XI. 34 and Vas 26 16 say that a brāhmana becomes free from all distrasses by Vedic recitations (japa) and sacrifices (homa). When the wife con fessed to the existence of a paramour, the Sat. Br. Il 5 2. 20 states that she made an offering into the Dahsinūgni with the mantra (Vaj S. IIT 45) 'whatever103 sin we have committed, whether in the village, in the forest, in society or by the organs of sense, we cast that away by this sacrifice, svāhā.' Both Manu (VII 105) and Yāj (II, 83) prescribe that when vitness tells a falsehood in order to prevent an accused person from be ing sentenced to death, he should offer for expiating his perjury an oblation of boiled rice to Sarasvati There are other homas also prescribed such as the Ganahoma, in which such Terses as 'agne naya supathā' from the Taittirfya sākhā are recited (Mahārnava). 

The old idea of sacrifice seems to have been that it was propitiatory in character Sacrifice was not demanded or required by God. Sacrifice 'vas probably regarded as a gift which pleased God, induced Him to forgive a man for his transgressions and enabled erring man to regain God's favour which had been lost by some shortcoming or some sinful act Sacrifices therefore had an expiatory or cleansing function or character. Sacrifices may be performd by offerings either an animal (meant as substitute for the sinner himself who had forfeited his life for his sins and transgressions) or a burnt offering or any other thing offered to God and then distri buted to others. 

Japa (muttering of Vedic passages as prayers) Japa is of three kinds, vācihaz (audibly uttered), upūnsul (inaudibly uttered) and mūnasa (nentally revolved), each succeeding one being ten times superior, acc to Laghu Hārsta IV. p 186,

Japa (repeating Vedic prayers) (Jivananda L.).104 Sabara (on Jai. XIL. 4. 1) distinguishes japa from stutt, the former being simply an utterance or recitation of a mantra or mantras105. Inaudible japa is praised 106 in Sankhāyana Br. 14, 1. The Āśy. Śr 11 20 provides that japa, anumantrana, āpyāyana and upasthāna are uttered upamsu. The Ap. Sr (24 1, 8-10 ) provides that mantras from the Rgveda and the Sāmaveda are uttered in sacrifices loudly and that passages of the Yajurveda are muttered upāmšu and the Tai. Pratisakhya. 23.6 states that upamsu recitation is made by means of the effort of speech organs but without sound (i.e. in a very low voice) and without the mind being directed (to utterance with udātta and other accents) i e. 'Karanavad asabdam-amanah-prayogam-upamsu'. Gaut. 19.12 (- Baud. Dh. S. II, 10 10=Tas 229) prescribes the following Vedic texts as purifiers: Upanisads, Vedānta texts, the Samhitā texts of all the 

Vedas (and not the padapotha or kramapatha), the Yajus texts in 

• which the word 'madhu' occurs, the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg,

Even he who has stolen gold (of a brāhmana) instantly becomes free from guilt if he once mutters (the hymn) beginning with 'asya vāmasya'i e. Rg I. 164 1-52), and the Sivasankalpa (Va) S XXXIV. 1-6). The violater of a guru's bed is freed from sin if he repeatedly recites the hymn beginning with 'havispāntam' ( Rg. X 88 1-19 ) and the hymn beginning with 'na tam-ambo' (i e. Rg X 126 1-8), the hymn beginning with 'iti' (i e.

One guilty of a grievous offence should mutter the seven verses beginning with 'Indram' (Rg I. 106 1-7) A twics-born man removes even yery great guilt by offering clarified butter for a year (in fire) with the mantras for the Šakalahomas (Vāj 8 VIII 13) or by muttering the

mantra 'nama id-ugram' (Rg. VL 51. 8) One who is stained by mortal sin becomes pure if with a concentrated mind he attends cows for a year, reciting the Pāvamāni hymns (the whole of Rg. IX) and subsisting on alms 114a 

So much importance and such occult povers came to be attached to the words of the Rgveda that the Rgvidhāna of Saunaba (which is later than Manu) concerns itself with prescribing numerous hynins of the Rgveda for the removal of Farious diseases, of sins, for the conquest of enemies 

The Sama Br I. 5 says 115 generally that when no parti cular hymns are prescribed for the removal of sins Vedic mantras are powerful and become purifiers if accompanied by tapas and the Sāmans may be repeated for the same purpose from ten times as the minimum to 100 times as prāyagcitta, Gautama 19. 13 prescribes the kind of food on which one should subsist when one is engaged in japa viz, one was to live on milk alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only, to live on barley gruel prepared from a handful of grain, to eat gold116, to eat clarified butter, and to drink soma and so forth. Gautama 19.14 further lays down that all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (rşıs ), Cowpens and temples of the gods are places (which help to destroy sin). 

As the Veda could be studied in and after the sutra period only by the male members of the first three classes, the japa of Vedic texts for the removal of sins 'was not possible for Śūdras; therefore, the Mit. (on Yāj IIL 262) says that although the sūdra (and women and those born of pratiloma marriages also) has no adhakāra (power or capacity or authority) for the recitation of Gāyatri and other Vedic mantras, still the südra and women after revolving in the mind the name of the deity put in the dative case can engage in japa with the word namah (i a he can only utter the yords 'namo namah' and not om &c)

Taking the ruime of Hari Krsna is the highest. If a man remembers Nārāyana in the morning, at night, at twilight, at midday and the like, he at once secures the removal of sin' (Vispupurāna). The Brahma. purānal19 (216. 87-88) gives expression to a popular belief as follows:~"Men, even after committing sins many times through folly, do not go to Hell if they prostrate themselves before Hari who destroys all sins. Those men also who always remember Janārdana eyen by roguery go to the world of Vispu after death " The Visnupurāna affirms that those who contemplate upon the mantra of twelye letters (viz. 'om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya') do not return to the cycle of births and deaths. The great power of mantras is mentioned in the Adiparva (161. 14) by Kunti. The Nrsimha-purāna in chap. 18 eulogises the mantra of eight letters (om namo Nārāyapaya) and chap. 63,6, states "what is the use of many mantras and the performance of many vratas, When the mantra 'om namo Nārāyapāya' is capable of securing all desired objects". The mantra of five letters 'namah Sivāya' is dealt with in Lingapurāna (pārvārdha, chap. 85) and Saura purāna 65. Brahma-purāna speaks of vaidika mantras and Ūgamokta mantras (41. 63). The Nityācāra-paddhati (p. 67) says that it is necessary to understand the meaning of Vedic mantras in srauta rites but in smārta rites it is not so. 

Dana (gifts). Gaut. XIX, 16 provides120 that gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter and food are the gifts (that destroy sin) and may be optionally undergone as penance if no express mention is made thereof. Vas. quotes several yerses on gists one of which (29. 16) states: "whatever sin a man distressed for livelihood commits he is purified from that by giving land even if it be as small in extent as 'gocarma'"122. Visnu Dh S. 92.4 is to the same effect. Sam. varta122 (204) prescribes that the gists of gold, cow and land

The subject of dana has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh vol II pp. 837-888 A few further remarks may be made here In many inscriptions and copperplate grants of lands or villages the donor usually states that the grant is made for the increase of the merit of himself and of his parents ( 

eg. E. I vol. XI, p. 219 at p 221). Brhaspati123 as quoted in the Madanaratna (vyavahāra p 66) expressly provides that in land-grants the king should state that he made the gift for securing merit to his parents and to himself124 The Rājatarangini (I 143 ) 125 refers to the founding of whiras (monasteries). 

Upavūsa (fasting). Fasting strictly means total abstin ence from food and drink, but generally it means light diet restricted in quantity and also as regards the nature of the articles taken. Even the Tai s. (I. 6. 7 3-4) referg186 to three ways of observing vrata on the days of the Dar sapürnamāsa-ists either by subsisting only on food available in the village or on forest food or partaking of no food at all. Gaut 19 11 includes upayāga among the several means of removing sins Tapas is also one of such means acc. to him. But in Gaut, 19 15 as stat ed above, Gaut includes fasting (anāšaha) among 'tapāmsi'.

In Europe the same practice prevailed 10 the middle ages, 'The founder (of monasteries) constantly tells us that this sacrifice is made for the Atonement of bis own $10s and those of bis progenitors and kiosfolk" G, G. Coulton ia 'Five centuries of Religion' (1936) vol III p. 27.

Haradatta explains upavāsa187 as giving up the eating of boiled rice (bhaktatyāga) and adds that upavāsa is again included under tapāīsi to show the great importance attached to it. Haradatta notes that a predecessor of his relying on a Purana passage explained upavāsa in Gaut. 19.11 as 'restraint of senses'. In many of the Grhya sūtras upavasa means only eating light food prepared from corn usable in sacrifices (such as rice) once in the day excluding vegetables, māsa (pulse), salt and flesh (compare Gobbila gr. I. 526, Khādira gr II 1.4 and 6, Kausika sūtra I 31-32, Kathakagrhya 46.2128). The Bļ. Up IV. 4. 22 closely associates 'anāśaka' (fasting) with tapas as a means to the mystic realisation of the Supreme Soul129. Jaimini (III. 8, 9 11) appears to regard fasting as tapas130, Manu XI 203 (=Vispu Dh. S. 54.29) provides that fasting (for a day) is the penance for omitting the rites ordained by the Veda (such as the Darśapūrpamāsa sacrifice and the performance of sandhyā adoration) and for neglecting the special duties oi a snataka (laid down in Manu IV. 34 ff). When a parson vas observing a fast he had to avoid doing certain other actions, Acc to Devala a fast becomes bereft of its good results by drinking water often, by chewing tambulał by sleep in the day-time and by sexual intercourse131 ; but the Garudapurada I 128,6 and Bhavisya purana (I. 184 27) allow even when one is fasting the use of flowers, ornaments, rich clothes, garlands, unguents, applying collyrium to the eye and the cleansing of teeth. Daksa quoted by the Par M states that if a man observes a fast for the day and night on the day on which the sun first turns towards the

Manu XI 166 (Agnipurāna 169.31) prescribes a fast for three days as a penance for theft of grass, firewood, tree, dry food (i e. grains of rice), jaggery, clothes, hide and flesh. The Anušāsanaparva (106 1) remarks133 that men of all varnas and even Mlecchas thought highly of fasts and that chapter contains an exaggerated eulogy of fasting Almost all religions (except Zoroastrianism) such as the Hebrew, Christian (in Lent) and Moslem (in Ramjan) cmphasize the necessity of fasting as a discipline or as a preparation for pentence The Bhavisya, purāna (L, chap 16. 12-14) states that those who have not kind led sacred fires can please the gods by vratas, restraints, gifts and particularly by upavāsas and points out (verses 18-22) what substances (eatables) should be given up from the first to the 15th trthi in each fortnight In the Satapatha Brāhmana and the śrauta and grhya sūtias the word upayasatha is used in the sense of 'upayāsa' and is derived from 'vas' (to dwell) with 'upa'. Vide H of Dh. yol I. p 1010 and n 2276 for the Šat Br. The Khādira gr II 1 4, Gobhila gr I. 62, Kausika-sūtra I. 31 employ the word upavasatha Āp Dh S.II 1 1 4-5 prescribe an upavāsa for busband and wife on parvan days and if they cannot totally abstain from food they should eat only once by day food proper for upavāsa Aparārka p. 199, Smr C (srāddha p 355) and Krtya ratnākara quote a veise from Vyāsa deriving the word upayāsa133. The Āp Dh S. II, 5 9-13, Baud, Dh II, 732, Vas 6 21 and Sāp gr. II 165 have the same verse viz. 'an āhitāgni, a draught ox and brahmacārin, these three fulfill (their work) by eating, they cannot fulfill their duties by non-eating'. This is explained as not applying to prāgascittag (Baud. Dh Ś II. 734) and to fasts on Ekādaśī, The śāntiparva 323 17 states 'Just as a dirty garment is after wards cleansed by water, so to those who are heated in the fire of) fasting inexhaustible happiness for a long time comes.' Sānti 79 18, however, says 'merely emaciat ing the body by fasting is not tapas, but ahimsā, truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, restraint and compassion are tapas'.

Tirthayatra ( Pilgrimages) 

Tirthayātrā :-Pilgrimage will be dealt with exhaus tively in a later section. It was believed that going on a pilgrimage and bathing in such holy rivers as the Ganges freed a man īrom sins. Vispu Dh. S. (35.6) lays down that those guilty of maliāpātalas may become pure by Ağvamedlia sacrifice or by visiting all the sacred placas on the earth. Devala says that a man removes the consequences of such grave sins as the murder of a brahmana that he may have committed uninten. fionally by the performance of great sacrifices or by going on a pilgrimage. Parāśara (XII, 58 ff) prescribes 134 pilgrimage to see Rāma's bridge to Lankā for a murderer of a brālmana who has studied the four Vedas. Devala statas: 'a man becomes freed from sin by approaching holy places and shrines, brālman nas that practise austerities, that all livers that fall into the ocean, all great mountains, all shrines and all forests are holy.' The Matsyapurada (184 18) says that a heap of sins as big as the mountain Meru or Mandara beconies destroyed when man reaches Avimukta (Benares), The Kümnapurāna135 (pûrvārdba 29.3) says 'I do not see any other expiation for destroying all sing in the Kaliyuga for all beings except Benares'. Even in the times of the Peshwas of Poona pilgrimage was prescribed for brāhmapa murder (vide. Selections from Peshwa Records, Vol. 43 p, 107) and the brāhmadas were ordered that after the sinner performed the penance they were to dine with him and recognize that he had been purified In an order dated sake 1659 (1737 AD) the Peshwa Bajirao the first informs the Deshmukhas, Deshpandes and Mukadams that four brothers named Zende approached him with the story that their father was born when their paternal grandmother "lived with one Pilaji Zende after she became a widow and that she intended to remarry that man but that had to be postponed owing to famine, that the caste meeting were prepared to take them into the

Prakāśa quotes & verse froni the Bhavisya purāna about the penance for brāhmapa murder to the effect that for him who dwells to the north of the Vindhya mountain Parāśara prescribes the sight of Satubandha os a penance and then remarks that a man from the north of Vindhya has to travel 360 yojanas to reach Setubandha and that since 360 Prājāpatya penances are declared to be enough to remove the sin of brahmahatyā, it impliedly follows that each yojana towards a tirtha is equal to one Prājāpatya, The Smrtyar thasāra (pp. 149-150 ) quotes several verses froin the Purānas stating that gods like Brahmā, Visnu and Siva, great sagos liko Bbrgu, Vasistha and Viśyāmitra, great kings like Hariscandra, Nala, Sagara obtained greatness by means of tirthas and that Pandavas, Sri Krsna, Nārada, Vyāsa and other sages engaged in pilgrimages for securing kingdoms and for removal of evil fortune.

CHAPTER III PRAYAŚCITTA; ITS ORIGIN, DERITATION 

AND JEANING 

It is not necessary to turn to prayascittas as removers of sin, A mumber of subjects will fall to be trusted here. 

First, an attempt inust be made to understand tlic etsnuo logy and meaning of the word 'prayascitta' in ancient times There are two forms of the word, prāyascitti and prayascitta, which occur in Vedic works without distinction of meaning and both forms are sauly old, though payascitti appears to be the older of the two The form prāyascitti frequently occuis in the Tai, s (as in II. 1.2,4, II. 1 4.1, III, 1,323, V 1.9.3, V. $12.1)1361, In some of these passages no question of sin arises. The void means 'doing some thing which would get rid of some accidental happening or mishap such as the breaking of an ukhā (a pot oi saucepan for bojling or cooking) or the sun's losing its brilliance,' In Tai S. V, 3.12.1 the word is used in the sense of an expiation for a sin. So even in very old books the word had two shades of meaning. The Kausitaki137 Br. (vi, 12) states : "they say 'whatever mistake or excess occurs in the sacrifice that affects the priest Iralımā, that he treats with the three fold learning (i, e, the three Vedas)". The word also occurs in the Atharraveda XIV. 1 30, Vāj. S. 39,12 (in close proximity to niskrti), in the Ait. Br. V 27, in the Sat. Br. IV.5,7,1, VII. 1,4 9, XI, 5.38, XIL 4.16 and in other works also The form prāyaścitta occurs in Kausītaki Br. V. 9, VI 12 and elsewhere, The Ašv. Śr. III 10.38 and Sānkbayana Śr. II 19.1 respectively employ the words prāyaścitti and prāyascitta13s In Pār gr I.

TIistory of Dharmasüslia 

(Vol. 10 the form 'prayascitti' is employed. Jai, in several places epiploys the word prāyaścitta (as in VI 37, VI 4.10, VI 5.45 and 49, XII 316). Sabara139 on the last sūtra (XIL 3.16) ex plains that the prāyaścittas (in the Sruti texts) are of two kinds, viz some are meant to make good the defect in the procedure and materials of sacrifice which arises or befalls through some neglect or heedlessness, while others are subsidiary parts of a rito when an occasion arises i e they are undertaken to atone for not doing what is ordained or doing something which is forbidden (e g non-performance of daily Agnihotra oven though the sun rises) The Sat. Br 140 XIT 4 and Ait Br. 322-11 pro vide some interesting and amusing examples of the mishaps for which prāyaścittas are provided e. g when a vicious boar, ram or dog runs between the sacrifical fires, or if Agnihotra milk gets spilled while the cow is being milked or if the milk pot is turned upside down or if it were to break or if the cow were to lie down while being inilked, or if the fire were to go out after the first libation is offered etc Vide also Mānaya-grhya I 3, Hir. gr I 51-16, Bhāradyāja gr IL 32, Kausika-sutra 46. 14-55, ĀŚY II 10 and Asy gr.

VL 1.157 explains'41 both prāyaścitti and prāyaścitta on the analogy of the word Pāraskara Prāgaścıttas may be said to be, in the language of the Mimāmsā, either ki atvartha or purusāi tha The former are prescribed in the Srautasūtras. It is the latter kind of prāycl soittas that are generally dealt with in Smrti works on prāya soitta In this work the prāyaścittas mentioned in Srauta

Derivation of Prayascitta 

works are passed over, as they have either been mentioned in vol. I. or were of rare occurrence even in olden days. 

Most digests and commentaries derive the word prāyaścitta relying on a verse (attributed to Angiras142 by some) from prāya (meaning "tapas') and citta (meaning resolve or firm belief), the idea being that prāyaścittas are so called because of their association with or emergence from a resolve to under go tapas or because of the firm belief that it will be a means of the removal of sin, Various other derivations are suggested by some writers. The Balambhatti143 on Yaj. TIL 206 quotes a half verse to the effect that 'prāya' means 'sin' and 'citta' means 'purification', which had been quoted by Paksadharamisra144, Bhaktūpādhyāya and the Todarānanda, but the Pr. M. (p. 2) says that the source or authenticity of that verse is doubtful. Hemādri refers to an unnamed bhāsyakāra's explanation viz. 'prāya' means 'destruction' and 'citta' means 'joining together' and prāyaścitta means the making good what is lost and that the word denotes & nainıttıka action on sin. 

The Par. M. quotes a smrti text145 and says that that is prāyaścitta whereby the 'citta' (the mind) of a repentant sinner is made generally (prayasah) free (from emotion i.e brought to a normal state) by the parsad (assembly of learned brahmanas). 

Here 'prayah' seems to be taken as equal to 'prayasah' and 'citta' has its usual sense, In Sāyana's 146 comment on the

of occasion arises), Jābāla q in the Pr. Prakāśa holds that priyascitta partakes of the nature of both naimittika and kāmya actions. The Pr. Prakāśa finds fault with the definitions of prāyascitta proposed by the Kalpataru, Sulapāni and others and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that those alone are prayascittas which are so spoken of by the learned, just as on Jaimini II.1.32 (tac-codakesu mantrākhyā) Bhattācārya explains that mantras are those which the respectable rājsīrhas and those who studied the Vedas so designate150.7 

Sins as stated by Brhaspatiisi and others are of two kinds, viz, intentionally committed and unintentionally committed. 

Great divergence of views has prevailed from very ancient times as to whether prāyaścittas can destroy sins intentionally committed Manu XI. 45 and Yāj. III. 226 are positive that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by prāyaścittas or by the study of the Veda The difficulty arises about sins coni mitted intentionally or with full knowledge, Gaut. (19, 3-6 

= Vas, 22. 2-5) states two views, 151a one holding that prāya Ścitta should not be performed since deeds (here sinful deeds) are not destroyed (except by experiencing the consequences thereof), the other view holding that prāyaścitta should be per 

(Continued froin the last page ) crimes in former lives men are boro blind or idiots &c.) penances must always be performed for the sale of purification, because those whose sins have not been expiated are born with disgraceful marks,' Though Manu employs the word 'dityam' here, what is meant is that wlien a sin is com mitted, a prāyaścıtta must necessarily be performed and it is poi lelt to the volution of the sinner whether to perform it or not Vide Mit on Yāj III. 220 But it does not follow from this that if prayascitta for removing a sin 19 not performed, another sir is thereby committed, for ia that case there would be anavastha (regressus ad infinitum)

The first says "152 "after performing the punahsioma 153 one can come back to (become fit for) soma sacri. fice (i, e, for Vedic rites in general). Another indication is · 'after performing Vratyastoma (one becomes fit for Vedic facri fices). A third is: 'He, who offers the Asvamedha sacrifice, crosses beyond all sin, beyond brahmana ipurder'. The fourth is. one should make a person charged with grave sins per form the Agnistut Vasistlia also (20 1-2) gives expression to the two views about the efficacy of penances, 154 Manu XI. 45 (latter half) states, that according to some, prāyaścittas may be prescribed for the removal of intentionally committed sins from indications contained in the Vedas. It cannot be said that these Sruti passages are mere ar thavūdas (i. e laudatory texts). They must really be taken, though expressed in the form of ordinary arthavādas, as laying down (a vdh) that one desirous of destroying his sins should perform Ašvamedha and the other sacrifices mentioned in this case the maxim of rātrisattra 155 applies (vide Jai. IV. 3. 17-19). There are certain satıras (sacrifices extending over more than twelve days) called Trayo

dasarātra, Caturdasarātra and so on. All these are called rātri Battras. With reference to these a Vedic passage says 'those who approach (i. e. perform) thesa rātrisattras attain stability (long life or super-eminence)'. In the text prescribing the Tātri gattras there is no mention of any special reward for perfor mance. Therefore 'stability' (pratastītā) contained in the passage must be held to be the reward of the performance of rātrisattras and not mere heaven (which is the reward of all sacrifices for which no special reward is mentioned, according to Jai. IV. 3. 15-16). The same maxim applies to passages like Yāj III. 226 which say that sin is removed by penances 156. Medhātithi draws attention to the story in the Tai.S. VI. 2.75, Kathaka S. VII, 5, Ait Br 35.2 that Indra consigned yutis to sulāurkas (dogs or wolves) and had to perforin the rites called Upahavya to get rid of the sin. Manu states his own opinion in the next verse (XI. 46) that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by the recitation of Vedic texts and sins conimitted intentionally through folly are destroyed by various prāyaścittas. Yāj. I. 226 (latter half) appears to hold that prāyaścittas do not destroy sins intentionally committed, but the sinner undergoing the prescribed penance becomes fit to be associated with other people on account of the texts (laying down the prāyagcittas); but Yāj, implies, it seems, that the results of sin intentionally committed (such as Hell and the like) are not got rid of. Manu XI. 189 prohibiting social in tercourse with singers who have not performed penance practi cally conveys the same idea as that of Yāy in III, 226 (latter half). Yā), III, 220 observes that a man guilty of patalas should perform prāyasoitta for his own purification (bero and in the next world); in this way (i, e if he performs penance) his inner soul recovers its composure and the people also become satisfied, This verse puts in a nutshell the purposes of prāyaścittas as conceived by the smrtis, viz. purging of sin (or purification), the satisfaction of the sinner's mind, admission to intercourse with

The Par. M. (11.1 pp 200-201) cites a Terza of Jābali and verses of Davala setting forth the two Tiers about the eficacs of prāyašcittas, while it also cites the view of Baudhayana-smti that there is no prāyašcitta for sins committed knoringly and the Tier of Angiras that the penance is doable in the latter case's Aagiras further says that prāgascitsas do destroy the sin arising from committing acts that are forbidden and the like, just as the rising sun removes dark ness Mapu II, 47 provides itssica-born man having become liable to perform a penance (for a sin), Thether he committed it through fate or by some act committed in a former existence, must not have intercourse with virtuous men until he performs The proper penance.'

IV) 

Twofold Consegnences of sin 

65 

Iu this conflict among the authors of smrtis the solution proposed by the Mit. on Yaj TII. 226 has been accepted by most medieval writers and is as follows160. The potentialities and consequences of sins are twofold, viz those leading to Hell and the others preventing intercourse with members of the society to which the sioner belongs Therefore, even though a prāya scitta may not be efficacious to prevent the first mentioned consequence (viz fall into Hell), there is nothing improper in prāgascitta being effective in removing the obstacle to associa tion with other people. As to sinful acts that are not pataniya (do not cause loss of caste) prāyaścitta does destroy such sin fulness as expressly stated by Manu, XI. 46. Even as to sins that are palaniya and are committed intentionally, if a penance ending in death is undergone as laid down by Manu XI. 73, Yaj III 247-248 and Gaut 22.2-3 for brahmana murder; Manu XI 90-91, Yāj IL 253, Gaut 23 1 for drinking surā; Gaut 23 8 11, Manu XI 103-104 and Yay. II. 259 for sexual intercourse with the guru's wife; Manu XI, 99-100 and Yāj. III. 257 for theft of brahmana's gold; them the sin is destroyed as stated by Ap. Dh S I924 25 and I 10.28.18 quotted above When Manu says (in XI. 89 latter half) that there is no penance for the sin of slaying a brāhmana intentionally, the proper interpretation of this read along with Manu XI 46 quoted above is not that there is total absence of prayaścitta in such a case, but that ordinary prāya 'scittas (such as those in Manu XI. 72) would not do in such a case, but only very heavy ones that would end in death. Medi eral digests like the Prāyascitta-muktāvali (folio 32a) hold that -according to the Kalıvar jya section penance ending in death is forbidden in the case of brāhmana sinners and therefore a

brahmana murderer can only be made to undergo the twelve years' penance, . 

The Par M. (TL part 1 pp 201–203) sets out this view of the Mit and appears to hold it itself. It sets out another view also. Those who hold this latter view read Yaj. II. 226 ag 'kāmatosvyavabāryastu' with an avagraha. The meaning then is that one who has performed the penance prescribed for a sin does not fall into Hell, but he cannot be allowed to associate with good men ( ģistas ) if he is guilty of a wilful sia, There is a verse of Manu (XI 190 = Visou Dh, s. 54,32 ) that one should not associate with those who slay children, who return evi) for the good done to them, who slay those that come for protection and who kill women, even though they might have become purified by undergoing the appropriate penance, There is a similar verse of Yāj III 298 on which the comment of Vijñāneśvara is most interesting as indicative of the spirit of our medieval writers who were always oppressed by the might of words (Vedic or smurti) deemed as authoritative. The Mit remarks 161 'the prohibition (contained in Yā). II, 298) is based on the text alone (and not on logic or reasoning). What cannot a text do? There is nothing too heavy for a text, Therefore, even though a light pedance is prescribed for slaying an adulterous woman, still there is a prohibition against associating with such slayers based on the words of the text',

The Power of Authoritative Texts 

This maxim is taken from the bhāsya of Sabara and is a favourite device with all Dharmaśāstra writers from Visvarūpa downwards to justify any statement of the smrtis however illogical or exaggerated it might appear to be. The Pr. T. (pp. 544-545) quotes 162 the Mit, about the two Śaktis of sin and its remarks on Yāj III, 298 and does not approve of them, relying on the words of Brhaspati that no decision should be arrived at on the bare words of the śāstra, but it should also be supported by reasoning and that the words 'slayers of women' do not refer to adulterous women but to innocent women (such as the wives of one's enemies), Narada. (sahasa, Verse 11) holds that those who are punished by the king with a five of the first or second (madhyama) kind can be allowed to associate with other members of society but those who are awarded the highest fine should not be spoken to by others 1624, Those who take the view of the sinner's inability to associate with other men even after undergoing penance rely also upon Vedānta-sūtra II, 4. 43 (bahis-tūbhayathāpi smrterācārācca). The Par, M, very rightly points 163 out that the sūtra refers to those who after going in for life-long celibacy abandon the duties of that stage of life (āśrama) and that it does not refer to householders and quotes a yerse of Kausika in support, The Smrti-muktaphala (Pr,, pp. 867-868) refers to this discussion contained in the Par. M. The Pr. M. (p. 7) appears 104 to hold that the great Sankarācārya explained

celibacy (either as naisthika brabmacārins or as sannyāsına ) , were to be excommunicated (and not to be associated with) The printed editions of the bhāsya contain no express quotation of Yajnavalkya's verse, but from the fact of his quoting Atri's Verse it is possible to hold that Sankarācārya understood Yajñavalkya as the Pr, M. says he did. 

A question may naturally be asked: why should it be accepted that penances destroy sin (as stated in Ya) I 226). The answer is: what 165 actions are grave sins or minor sins or not sins at all is laid down by the śāstra (śruti and smrtis) For example, it is not clear to ordinary people why being an officer over mines or making friends of low people or being a servant of a śūdra should be a sin at all But the smrtis say so. If the smrtis are to be relied upon for determining what acts are sinful, then it follows as a matter of course that the same smrtis which speak of penances as removers of sins must also be accepted and that no other means for determining the efficacy of penances can be appealed to So also the Bhagavad gitā (IV 37) states that the fire of spiritual knowledge consumes all (accumulated, saficta) actions (and their consequences). 

Many of the sins (though not all) for which penances are provided in the smrtis are also offences punishable by the king or State For example, murder, theft, incest, perjury are acts punishable by the State in almost all countries even now and were so in ancient and medieval India Persons guilty of these were also liable to undergo prāyaścittas. It is probably due to this double liability that punishments for crimes in ancient and medieval India were light as compared with the heavy punish ments for even trifling crimes inflicted in western countries only a century or two ago But there are other acts which are not punishable by the State now and were not probably punished even in ancient or medieval India by the king. For example, forgetting Veda studied by a person, not tonding Vedic fires consecrated by a person himself, sleeping till after sun-1188 and sleeping at sunset are palakas, aco to Vas I 19 and some of those are upapātakas acc to Yā, II239. It does not seem

IV) Prayascittas and Secular Punishments likely that an Indian king ever panished any parson for these. On the other hand, obstructing the road, prying when the king is taking his meals, sitting before the king on one's haunches, speaking loudly before the king are among the fifty chalas of which the king could take cognisance suo motus and award suitable punishment (vide H, of Dh vol III p. 266). But there is nothing to show that such actions ever fell within the purview of the rules about prāyascittas, The important questions are: What was the relation of the rules about prāyascittas which were to be prescribed by a parisad (a meeting of learned brāhmadas) to punishments by the king as regards actions which were both patakas inviting penances and crimes entailing punishments by the King? Which of these two sets of rules was earlier? Were penance and punishment cumulative or alternative? It is difficult to give definite opinions on these questions. We know that prāgaścittas like Ašvamedha are spoken of even in the Tai S. We also know that the prasnavivāla (which is quite close to prādyivaka in derivation and meaning) occurs in the Vaj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai Br. II. 5. 6. Therefore it follows that judicial functions were very early separated from the executive functions of the king. The reference to the ordeal of fire in the Tandya Br 14. 6. 6 (vide H, of Dh, vol. II p. 361) and the grasping of a red-hot hatchet in the hand by a person accused of theft and his being killed show that ordeals were administered and the punishment for theft was death. Bphaspati, quoted in the Vivādaratnakara, says 'When a man of good character and a diligent reader of the Veda has com mitted theft he shall ba kept in prison for a long time and shall be caused to perform penance after having been compelled to restore the goods' (S. B. E, vol. 33 p. 362 166). 

' The parişad made its own rules about prāyağcittas and the king awarded punishments. Which set of rules was earlier it is difficult to say. The king did not very probably interfere with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the parisad and the brāhmanas helped the king in the administration of justice by being judges and by advising him as to the punishments to be imposed (vide 

166. Frequart en una sua part I HA E ETC: पायश्चित्तं तु कारयेत् ।। बृहस्पति g by विवादरत्नाकर p 331. It is possible that this 1 erse means that a learned brābmana who has been well conducted but fell A victim to the temptation of theft should not be jailed for a long time because jaut life torments bis mind and therefore he should be made to restore stolen property and given pedaace,

History of Dhiar masastra 

(Vol. Vigou Dh, S. V. 194). Gautama VII1, echoing the words of the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4 5, observes: 167 'the king and the brāhmada with profound learning uphold the moral order in the world (or are upholders of the sacred law). The Āp. Dh, S. (I 5.10, 12-16) contains very important inforniation: 'The ācārya shall order those who, while participating according to the śāstras (in the privileges and responsibilities of their castes), have gone astray through the weakness of their senses to perform penances accord ing to tlie dictates (of the smrtis) commensurate with their (sinful) acts. If they transgress their ācārya's order he shall take them to the king. The king shall send them to his purohita proficient in dharmaśāstra and the science of government. He (purohita) shall order them to porform (proper penances) if they are brābmapas. He shall reduce them by forcible means except corporal punishment and slavery.' So this passage shows that the king helped in carrying out prāyas cittas. Narada includes 'neglect of penancas' anong matters solely dependent on the king (prakirpaka, verse 3) and not on complaints by private individuals. Davala 168 probably conveys the real position when he says: "The king is the giver of krochras (i. o his consent is required for actually undergoing the prescribed penances), the learned man who has studied Dharmaśāstras prescribes the prāyaścitta, the sinner carries out the penance and the king's officer sees to the safe performance of the prescribed penance' Parāśara VII, 28 says 'an assembly should point out the proper penance after getting the permission of the king, it should not be done without reference to him, but slight penance may be done with out informing him', The Par, M. I. part 1. p. 232 explains that this applies to prayascittas for sins like govadha or those that are greater than it. Devala 169 also has similar verses.

Relation of the Parisad and the King 

Parāšara VIL, 29 states that the king also should not ignore the parisad and should not by himself prescribo penance. Paithinasi quoted by the Dandaviveka (p. 76) provides 170 for both prāyağcitta and punishment and from the tenor of the verse 

it appears that both were to be enforced by the king. The posi - tion is tolerably clear as to medievel times One feels great hesitation in stating definitely the relation of punishment to penances and the king's position as to both in ancient times. Ap. Dh, S. 1. 9. 24. 1-4 provide 172 that one who kills a ksatriya or a vaisya or a šūdra shall respectively give one thousand COWS, a hundred cows and ten cows for the purpose of removing the enmity and that in each of these cases one bull was to be given in addition for the purpose of expiation. Āpastamba does not expressly state to whom the cows were to be given, The commentator Haradatta explains that they were to be given to brāhmadas. Manu XI. 127, 129, 130, and Yāj II. 266-267 have similar provisions but in the chapter on penances. On the other hand, Baud, Dh, S.I. 10 23, expressly states that the COws are to be given to the king. As both the words 'vaira niryātanartham' and 'prāyaścittarthaḥ are employed by Ap. it may be said that the cows were to be made over to the king even according to Āpastamba. The cows were to be made over to the king for bestowa) on the family of the murdered person to mollify them and if they refused to receive them the king was 

of to retain them for himself but was to distribute them among brāhmanas. We know that Manu (IX. 243–245) provides that the fine recovered from a man guilty of mortal sins vas not to be taken for himself by the king but was to be offered to Varuna and thrown into water or was to be distributed among learned brāhmapas. Manu IX, 236 provides that for those who were guilty of the four grave sins (brāhmada murder &c.) and did not undergo penanca for the same the king should ipflict corporal punishment (branding on the forehead) toget her with fine in accordance with the śāstra, Manu IX. 237

(= Matsya 227 164) and Visnu V, 4 say that on the forehead a mark of female private parts with red-hot iron should be branded in the case of incest, the mark of a tavern flag in the case of drinking surā, the mark of dog's foot in the case of theft (of brāhmana's gold) and the mark of a beadless trunk in the case of a beabmapa-murder. Manu IX. 240 further prescri bes that men of all castes guilty of the four mahāpātakas com mitted unintentionally that perform the proper penance should not be branded on the forehead by the king but shonld ba awarded the highest fine Manu IX, 241 and 24% provide that a brāhmang guilty of these grave sins unintentionally may be punished with the middle amercement (if he himself be possessed of good qualities) but if he was guilty of the grave sins committed intentionally he should be banished from the kingdom being allowed to take with him his wealth and paraphernalia; while persons other than brāhmapas when guilty of grape sins unintentionally com nitted were to be deprived of all their wealth and if guilty intentionally they were to be sentenced to death. These verses show that though prāyascitta be per formed persons guilty of grave sins were liable to undergo punishment and if no penance was performed then they were liable to branding and also fines etc Manu XI. 56 provides that bearing false witness is similar to the drinking of sund and Manu XI, 57 and Yaj. II. 230 hold that misappropria tion of a deposit is like the theft of gold Vispu Dh. S (V 169 ) provides that the mugappropriator of a deposit was to be wade to return the deposit or its price with interest and was to be punished like a thief by the king and V 179 that a false witness had all his property confiscated. Theso instances establish that both fines by the king (i, e lāja-danda ) and penances prescribed by the assembly of learned men (i. parisaddanda or daiva danda) had to be undergone by those guilty of some grave sins that were also looked upon as crimes In some cases the penance and the punishment were the same for example, Gaut 23 10-11, Vas. 20. 13, Manu XI 104, Yaj. III 259 and several other smrtikāras prescribe for incest the penance of the excision of the testicles and penis and proceeding toward the south or south-west till the body falls Nārada as quoted above proscribes for incest the punishment (danda) of the excision of the testicles The Mit. on Yaz. m. 233 quotes Nārada and remarks that the punishment of excision and death prescribed by Yāj III, 233 applies only to non-brābmapas and that in such cases the punishment of death itself is theIV) 

Prayasrutia and punishment by kung 

prāgaścitta There were works like the Madanapārijāta272 (p. 827) and the Mitaksarā that held that the prohibition against corporal harm to brāhmanas (Manu VIII. 380) applies only to matters other than prāyaścittas and that since the Mapusorti itself (XI. 100) states that a brābmana guilty of theft of brāhmana's gold may go to the king with an iron club and have his head smashed by the king, the death of a brāhmana as a penance for theft by being struck with a club presented by himself was not Tuled out. In some cases punishment by the king was deemed to have purged a man of sin and so penance seems to have been thought necessary, as Manu VII, 318 (=Vas 19.45 ) says 'men that commit sins and are punished by the king become purified and reach heaven like good men who perform meritorious deeds.' The Mit on Yā). I, 259 explains that this holds good only where the punishment is death, as in the case of incest noted above. Āp. Dh. S. II. 10 27. 15-16 provide 173 that & parson guilty of slaying a man, of theft and of forcible seizure of land was to be deprived of his wealth by the king and was to be sentenced to death and that if the offender was a brahmana he was to have a piece of cloth tied over his eyes for the whole of his life (i. e, he was not to be sentenced to death). It appears that in very ancient times as provided by Āp. Dh, S, I 9.25,4 the thief approached the king 174 with a club (of iron or khadira wood) on his shoulder and announced his guilt, when the king struck him with the club; on his being killed he became free from guilt. This was a panance as well as a legal punishment. Manu has a similar rule in his chapter on punishments (VIII, 314-316) providing that the thief should carry a weapon (called musala) ora Club of khadira wood or a double-edged saklı or an iron staff and that if the king strikes him once with the club and he is killed

History of Dhar mašāstia 

I Vol or if he is not killed but is allowed to go half dead and lives, the thief is froed from the guilt. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 257 quotes a prose passage from Sankba and a verse from Samvarta (12%) to the same effect Manu in the chapter on ponances (XI. 100-101 = Agnipurāda 169. 20-21) provides the game procedure for theft 89 a pedance. Vas 20. 41, Yay. II. 259, Viggu 52, 1-% and Parāsara XII, 69-70 provide a somewhat similar pedance for the thief of brahmana's gold. Vasistha introduces an important change viz, that the king hands over to the thief & weapon made of udumbara wood (or probably of copper) with which the thief is to kill himself. It appears that gradually the king gave up this unpleasant method of award ing punishmont porsonally Nārada 175 (parisista, verses 46-47) provides that after the thief comes running to the king and announces his guilt, the king was to touch him (with the olub, as a symbolic gesture) and then let him off aud the thief ba came froed from sin by his confession of guilt. It has to be remembered, howover, that the thief had to restore, even when he underwent penanco, stolen property, as stated by Manu VIII, 40, Yāj. I 36 and 270, Brhaspati and by digasts 176 like the Pr. Prakarang If it were impossible to make the thief restore the stolen property the king had to make it good from his orn treasury 377 (Gaut X. 47, Sāntiparya 75, 10, Kautilya II. 16) or he had to make his officers 1:8 entrusted with the duty of preventing thefts pay the price of the stolen property (Ap Dk. S. II. 10. 26. 8). Vide for further details H, of DI YOL III. pp. 166-168. It appears that the actual carrying out of the sentence of death was later on assigned to Candalas as stated by Manu X, 56 and Vişnu Dh, S. 16. 11 (vadhya-ghātitvam cāndalānām).

Circumstances to be considered Another point to be noted is that as regards the awarding of punishments and prescribing of penances, the matters to be considered trere the same viz. whether the lapse was inten tional 179 (kāmataḥ) or unintentional (akāmatah) or whether it was the first offence or whether it was repeated and what the circumstances as to the time, the place, the caste, the age, the capacity, learning, wealth were. Compare Kautilya IV. 10, Gaut.XII. 48, Manu VII. 16 and VIII. 126, Yaj I 368, Visnu v. 194, Vas. 19.9 about punishments with Baud.188 Dh. S. I. 1.16, Yāj. III. 293 (= Atri verse 248 and Agnipurāna 173, 6), Angiras 143,Visvamitra, Vrddha-Haritalx.297, and Vyāghra as regards penances It is on account of this close connection between punishments and penances that the Prāyaścittatattva, after quoting Derala to the effect that if a man makes no move for taking prayascitta for one year, he has to undergo double penance thereafter and to pay a double fine to the king, re marks that the maxim is that prāyasoittas are to be moulded on the lines of punishments1ss. The Pr. M. (pp. 124-125) quotes Kāsyapa who provides a penance for one that causes mischief to a well, public park, bridge, rampart wall or a temple or idol, then quotes Vispu V. 169 which prescribes the highest fine for a breaker of idols, Mantu IX 285 which provides a fine of 500

Tast Literature on prājaścittas 

The literature on prāyaścittas is vast in extent, since in ancient times they loomed very large in the popular mind. Out of tho 28 chapters of the Gautamadharma-sútra, ten (i. e, more than one-third of the whole) are devoted to pavancesOut of the 30 chapters of the printed Vasistha-dharmasútra, prāyašcittas cover pine (20-28) Manu devotes versos 44 to 265 (in all 222) of chapter eleven to penances and the Yājñavalkyasmrti con taining 1009 versos deals with prāyaścittas in 122 verses (II. 205-327).

Many other smortis and several purānas, such as the Agni (chap 168-174), Garuda 5%, Kūrma (Uttarardha 30-34), Varāla 131-136, Brabmānda (Upasamhārapādachap. 9), Visoudbarm ottara (II 73, II 234-237) contain hundreds of verses ou prāyaścittas. Besides commentaries like the Mitaksarā, Aparārka, Par, M. and others and digests like Madanapārijāta (pp. 691-994), there are special digests dealing with prāyaścittas alone such as Hemādri on Prāyaścitta (which is of doubtful authenticity), the Prāyaścittaprakarana of Bhavadeva, Prāya. scittaviveka, Prāgascittatattva, Spirtimuktāphala (prayascitta section), Prāgascittasāra (part of Nrsimbaprasāda), Prāya scittamayūkba, Prāgascittaprakāśa (ms. in the Anūp Sapskrit library, Bikaner, No. 2610), Prāgascittendusekbara of Nāgojibhatta, which have been utilised in this work. The niost elaborate treatment is found in Prayascittaviveka, Par. M. I parts 1 and 2, and Prayascittaprakāśa, 

The commentators discuss the question about the persons who have adhikara (capacity) for having penances prescribed for them Since Manu XI, 44 (prāyascittiyate narah) and Yāj II. 219 (parah patanam-rcchati) both employ the word 'man' without 184 any qualification, the commentators and digests say that penances are meant for men of all vardas, for all persons born of unions in the reverse order (pratilomajas) and for even cāndalas. Yāj. III, 262 states that a šūdra sinner

Angiras 185 provides that penance may be administered to a gūdra devoid of japa and hioma. Even as to japa and homa there were works like the Madanapārijāta p. 749 and Vy. M (p. 112) that relying on a verse of Parāśara VI, 63-64 held that a homa could be performed for women and sūdras in the ordinary fire through & brāhmang186, The Pr, V, relies on Manu X. 62 and a prose passage of Devala for the proposition that even Candālas have to perform penances, if they act contrary to the rules and pro hibitions laid down for them Since the non-performance of what is prescribed and doing what is forbidden lead to sin, the person guilty of these or the person who has a desire to destroy his sins is a person entitled to perform prāyaścitta, as also one who repents of his guilt. 

Before going into the subject of the several prāyaścittas prescribed for each grave or minor sin, some questions of a general character have to be disposed of. 

Some smrtis like Brhad-yama II. 1-% and Sankha state that a boy over five years of age and less than eleven years old, if guilty of some pātakas such as drinking surā, has not to undergo penance personally, but his brother, father or other

Prayascuttes and children relative or friend has to undergo it for him and that if a child is less than five then whatever act it may do it is not deemed a crime, nor is it a sin and it is not liable to any legal penalty nor to any 187 prayascitta. The Mit. (on Yaj, II. 243) comments that these verses are not meant to prescribe a total absence of prāyaścitta in the case of children of five or less but are meant to convey that they are not liable for the full prāyascitta prescribed for a sin. Its argument is that the texts lay down generally without any reference to the stage of life that a brāhmana should not be killed or that a person belonging to the three higher castes should not drink surā.18 Hence any one of whatever age who is guilty of having done such prohibited acts is liable and the words of Gaut. II 1 and of Kumāra are to be interpreted as not excusing altogether the drinking of surā by a child but as referring to minor lapses. Brhaspati expressly states that the dictum about a child being allowed to eat what it likes is confined to such matters as will not fall under grave sins, 

It has already been stated above (n 180) that the praya ścitta to be undergone depended upon many circumstances such as the time, the place, the age &c. And first as to age, several smrti3289 provide that a man 80 years old or a boy less than ___187 जनैकादशवर्षस्य पञ्चवर्षात्परस्य च । मायश्चित्तं चरेद् भ्राता पिता धान्य सुहृज्जनः॥ अतो वालतरस्यास्य नापराधो न पातकम् । राजदण्डोन तस्यास्ति प्रायश्चित्तं न विद्यते ॥ शहा quoted by the मिता on या II 243, बृहद्यम III 1-2 (reads aन्यापि वान्धव../ These are quoted by Free on II 6 (without pame) and the first occurs In आपस्तम्बस्मृति III 7 as चरेद्वरुः सुहद्वापि प्रायश्चित्तं विशोधनम् .

(Vol. 

16 years of ago, women and diseased persons should be liable onls to half the prayascitta (prescribed for able-bodied men) The Mit on Ya, IIT 243 quotes a verse of Sumantu that for a male below twolvo and abovo cighty years of age the penance is half (of that for ordinary men) and one fourth for women within the same limits and a verso of Visnu that for women, old men and diseased persons half the penance should be prescribed and for boys (boforo upanayana ) only one-fourth. Some say that for boys less than five the ponanco is one-fourth Cyafana (prose) proscribes halī prāvascitta for bogs, old men and women and declaros that a person is a bāla up to 16 years and a man is to bo regarded as similar to a bala after 70. Kātrāyana prorided gonorally that the fines to be leried from females were to be half of those loriable from mālo offenders as regards all offences and when the punishment for a male would be doath, a woman criminal was to be punished with the cutting of a limb (nose, ears &c ) 199 

The difference between a sin committed unintentionally (akamatah) and the samo sin committed Tith full knowledge (kāmatah) is this that for the latter the prayascitta is double of what is prescribed for the former as provided by Adgiras, 191 Vyāsa and the Agnipurano, As Yāj. III. 226 employs the rord 'ajñana' in the first half and tho word 'kāmatah' as its opposite in tho socond half instead of the word 'jānatah' it follows that Yāj, inakes no difference between the consequences of yāna (knowledge) and 1āmanā (desire). 

The caste of the ofiender as well as of the victim made 3 difference in the prayascitta as well as in the legal punishment. Vide H. of Dh vol. III pp. 395-399 as to punishments for crimes dependent on caste. Visau 192 provides that the pripascitta for

and of what is prescribed for a brāhmana sinner, The Agni purāna says 193 the same thing. The Par, M II. 1. p. 231 quotes the Caturvimsatimata194 to the same effect. The Mit. on Yaj. IIT, 250 explains that the verse of Caturyimśatimata applies to all cases except where any one of the four sāhasas is committed by a man of a lower caste as against ona of a higher caste. Brhad-Yama (IV. 13-14) in prescribing penance for the kill ing of a cow provides the same scale of 4, 3, 2, 1 for the four Varnas Angiras (verse 3) prescribes the penances of Krcchra and Candrāyana for a brahmana partaking of the food of an antyaga, half of these for a ksatriya or vaiśya guilty of the same. Yaj II 206-207 provide that the punishments for defamation depend upon the higher or lower varda or caste of the offender as well as of the person defamed and that if a ksatriya or yaiśya defames a brāhmana the fines are respectively twice or thrice as high as the fine for a wrāhmana defaming a brāhmana and conversely if a brābmapa defames a ksatriya or a vaiśya the fine is reduced by half in each successive caste. The Mit quoting Angiras says that the rules about punishments apply to prāyaścittas for slaying a person i e, if a brāhmana slays anybody and a certain penance is prescribed for him, then a ksatriya killing the person would have to perform double the penance prescribed for the brāhmaṇa and a vaiśya offender three times as much 195 It may be pointed out here that though the smrtis provided for different punishments according to the castes of the offender and of the person wronged and though some commentaries and digests went into all those details for the sake of presenting a

complate statement or digest of the smrti material, such discriminatory punishments had mostly ceased to be enforced by the rulers from about the 12th century A. D. at least, as stated by the Smrticandrikā, the Madanaratna (vyavabāra) and the Sarasvativilāsa. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II p 512 note 924 for the relevant quotations from the three works. Since, as stated above (n. 181), prāyaścittas were to be moulded on the lines of legal penalties, it appears that the discriminatory treatment about prāyascittas depending upon the varna of the sinner must also have gradually fallen into disuetude with the disappear ance of the more severe prayascittas and the substitution of COWB and monetary equivalents in later digests, And some digests expressly state this to have been the case in relation to prāyaścittas. For example, the Pr Prakarada, after quoting Gaut. 22. 14-16 about the prāyaścitta for killing a ksatriya or vaisya or sūdra under certain circunstances, remarks that in its day those prayaścittas vere no longer part of the practices of the people.196 

Whether an act made a man liable to undergo prayas. oitta depended in some cases on the country also. For example, marrying a materna) uncle's daughter yes and is allowed in certain countries and among certain castes in the Deccan and Southern India on the ground of custom, but such a practice was severely condemned by Manu XI. 171-17% and Baud Db S. I 1 17-24 and other smrtis. Brhaspati refers to this custom as prevalent among southerners and states that in these countries persons following it are not liable to undergo prayascitta or penalty (at the hand of the king). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 462 for Brhaspati's verses, 

Severity and extent of prāyascitta depended also on the question whether a sinner had repeated the lapse or was a first offender. The Āp Dh S (II. 10. 27. 11-13) prescribes that & brahmana who has once committed adultery with a married woman of equal class shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for a südra having intercourse with a woman of the three upper castos, that for every repetition (of the crime) one

fourth of the pedance must be added and if the commits adultery) for the fourth time, the whole penance (of 12 years must be performed 197). The Mit on Yāj. II, 293 remarks that for a sin that is committed knowingly the prāyaścitta is double of what is prescribed for the same sin if committed unintention ally and that if a sin is committed intentionally and is repeated then for the repeated lapse prāyaścitta is four times as much as that for the same deed done unintentionally. Similarly, the āśrama to which the sinner belonged made a difference in the prāyasoitta as stated by Angiras 'when persons in other āšramas are guilty of sins for which penance is prescribed if committed by householders, then the prāyašcitta is increased in the same proportion that is laid down for sauca (bodily purity198). Manu V.137, Vas. VI. 19, Visnu Dh. S 60 26, Sankha. 16.23-24 pro vide that Vedic students, forest hermits and sannyāsins have respectively to perform twice, thrice and four times as much sauca as is prescribed for householders (e. g. by Manu V. 136 

Visnu 60.25). 

One convenient and merciful rule laid down by the smrtis was that if a man died in the midst of the period for which pedance had to be performed (sometimes it extended to twelve years or more he becaine free from the sin here and in the next world as stated by Harita, Vyasa and Yama199. 

Though the smrtis have entered into very great details about the prayascittas for different individual lapses, still they cannot be supposed to have dealt with every lapse. Therefore,

not conceal his lapse and lose time; he should bathe with his garment on, and with the garment still wet approach the assembly and should prostrate himself on the ground Thus the elders of the assembly ask the man prostrating himself before them 'what is your business, what is the trouble and what do you seek from us'. The assembly then asks him to go aside a little and debats among themselves what the penance should be, considering all the circumstances of time, place, nature of the lapse, age &c Thon one of them at the desire of the assembly should declare the assembly's decision as to the proper penance after citing the smrti passages and reducing the ponance in view of the weakness and other circumstances of the offender, It has already been stated that the pairsad acted under the direction of the king in matters of prāyaścitta and that the king was not to interfere with the decision of the assembly. The principal stages in a penance were four viz. approaching tho parisad, the declaration of the appropriate penance by the parisad, the actual performance of the penance declared and the announcing of the siuner's freedom froin taint (Angiras q. by Pr. Prakasa folio 27a 'upasthānam vratādesascarya suddhi. prakāśanam i prāyaścittam catuspādam vihitam dharmakartr bhih").

If the learned brahmanas of the assembly knowing the proper prāyaścitta do not declare it in the case of those who are distressed by their own sin apd soek direction, they incur sin similar to that of the seeker after proper penance 206,

CHAPTER IV 

PENANCES FOR PARTICULAR SINS 

It is now proper to turn to the penances prescribed for individual sins of different types (grave sins, minor sins and the like). It may be noted that the smrtis contain numerous prāyaścittas for the same sin and that it is often difficult to reconcile all the dicta The commentaries and digests such as the Mit and the Prāgascitta-viveka therefore try to assign to each pobancs an appropriate provision, looking to all the circum stances noted above (i.e they are bont on 'visayavyavastha").206 In this work, it is not necessary to set out in detail the numerous penances for numberless lapses that are prescribed in the several smrtis and digests. In the Sabdakalpadruma (part III) there is an analysis from the Prayasoitta-viveka alone of the several lapses, the penances for them, the number of cows to be donated as substitutes, the monetary equivalents when even COVs cannot be donated and the dalcsınā in each case, which occupy pages 321 to 364. Satting out all these lapses together with the penances for them would only be a matter of academic interest and of no practical value, as almost all the prāyaścittaa have become antiquated and are hardly ever performed now except in the form of gifts of cows or money to brahmanas, pilgrimages and recitation of Vedic mantras or japa of the names of some favourite deity such as Visdu or Siva. Therefore only a few typical sins alone will be taken for treatment here and later on a list of all penances with brief descriptions will be furnished. 

First come the Mahāpātakas, Sankha 207 (17.1-3) prescribes the following penance for the four mahāpātakas: the sinner should bathe thrice every day, should erect in a forest a cottage thatched with leaves, should sleep on the ground, should subsist

on leaves, roots and fruits, should enter a village for alms all the time declaring his misdeed, should eat only once a day. When the 12th year passes in this way, the thief of gold, the drinker of surā, the murderer of a brāhuiapa and one who is guilty of incest become free from sin. Visnu Dh S. 34.1 speaks of sexual intercourse with one's mother, daughter or daughter in-law ag aanūtala and (34.2) provides that there is no penance ercept entering fire for this grave sin. The Bhavisyapurana, Hārīta and Samyarta (q. by the Pr. V p 43) say the same But other smrtis like Manu XI. 54 and Yaj III 227 treat māte gamana as & mahāpātaka (gurutalpa-gamana) and intercourse with the daughter or daughter-in-law as equal to yiolating guru's bed (Manu XI. 58, Yi). III. 233-234). Therefore we begin with the mahāpatakas the first of which is the murder of a brāhmapa Gaut. 22 2-10, Ap Dh, S I. 9.24 10-25 and I. 9 25 12-13, Vas 20. 25-28, Visou Dharmasūtra 35.6 and 50. 1-6 and 15, Manu, XL 72-82, Yāj III 243-250, Agnipurāna 169. 1-4 and 173 7-8, Samyarta 110-115 and many others prescriba various penances for brālmana-murder. As the treat ment of Manu is tolerably long, an analysis of it alone will be 

given liere, Manu as stated by the Bhavisyapurada (quoted by Kullüka op Manu XI. 72-82, Aparārka p 1055 and Pr Y, p 63) speaks of 13 separate penances for brahmahatya 20%. The general rule was that for a man of any class who is directly guilty of intentional murder of a brālimana the penance was to end in death209. The thirteen penances as set out by Govindananda in his commentary (called Tattvārthakaumudi) on Prayascittaviveka (p 63) are as follows 

(1) The murderer of a brāhmana should construct a hut in a forest and dwell therein for twelve years, should subsist on alms and should carry a piece of the head-bones of the murdered man on & staff. This is a very ancient penance and other smrtis add some details. For example, Gaut 2% 4 provides that the sinner should submit to observances meant for a Vedic student (such as not partaking of flesh, honey etc. stated in

III. 243 prescribes that the sinner should have a piece of the head-bone in the hand (left) and another placed on a staff (in the right hand) and that he should sat a moderate quantity' (i e. only once a day). The carrying of the piece of the head-bone in one hand is not meant for beggipg alms thorein but only as a symbol, There was some.divorgenooi of views on this point,209a, Ấp Dh. S, 1.9.-24, 14 further provides that he should beg for alms at seven houses in only a broken reddish vessel (of clay or copper) and wear a piece of hempen cloth round his waist that will reach a little above his knees and that if he got no food at the seven houses he had to go with out food that day and that he should protect cows and may for that purpose (for taking them out for grazing or bringing them back) enter the village again. The Mit. (on Yaj. II. 243) adds that the staff with head-bone on and the head-bone carried in. the left hand are merely symbolic (in order to remind him and others of his being guilty of brāhmada murder), that he-should on seeing an arya avoid his path (Gant. 22.5), - that the should keep standing by day and only sit down at night (Gaut. 82.6) and bathe thrice in the day (Gaut. 22.6). It is added by the Mit. that, if the murdered brahmana's head-bone cannot be had, that of any other brahmana would do. The Mit. adds that this vrata 210 for twelve years propounded by Gautama, Manu, Yājñavalkya and others is one and not different for each smrti and therefore a}] the details that are not opposed to sach other should be included. Apararka p. 1053 (on Yai. III. 243) relies on the 'sarvasakhapratyayanyaya' and statest

III, 237 who held that the procedure prescribed by each smrti vas separate and that all details taken from different smrtis were not to be roixed up. According to the Mit, and Kullüka (on Manu XI. 72) this yrata for 12 years is appropriate in the case where a brāhmana is murdered unintentionally and Kullaka quoting Angiras provides that for intentional brāhmana murder tho penance will be double (i. e. 24 years). The Mit (on Yaj. II. 243) states that this observance for twelve years applies only to one who syas himself directly the murderer of a bralniana and that the anugrāhaka has to undergo only 9 years' vrata, the prayojaka only six years, the anumanta only 4 years and the nimittin only three years. It is further provided by the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 243) following a verse ascribed to Manu (not found in the printed text) and Devala 213 that if a man commits several murders of brāhmanas one after another, and performs ponance at one time for them, for two inurders he has to undergo the penance for 24 years and for three murders 36 years and when he commits the 4th murder there is no ponance (but only death is the penance). The Pr. T. (P. 468) on the othor hand, 214 following the Bhavisya-purāna holds that one per formance of the 12 years' penance is enough penance for the murder of several brālmanas, on the analogy of the Ksāmavati isti (Jai. VI. 4. 17-20 ) which is performed whon both the purodāgas and the house are totally burnt up by accident before the oblations are offered. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 19 a) also says the same and adds that Devala's Forse is to be interpreted as laying down that repetition of tho samo sinful act is more blamable. If the murderer of a brāhmano

was a ksatriya or & vaišya or a šūdra he had to perform the penance above described respectively for 24, 36 or 48 years. (Smrtyarthasāra p. 105). Instead of staying in a hut for twelve years he may stay at the end of a village or a cowpen and should tónsure his head and the hair on the lips or he may stay in an hermitage or at the foot of a tree and should devote himself to doing good to brāhmanas and cows and should observe celibacy (Manu XI. 78 and 81). At the end of 12 years he destroys the sin of brahmana-murder, 

(2) According to Ap Dh. S. I, 9.25.12, Gaut 22, 3, Manu XI, 72, Yā. III, 248, if a ksatriya intentionally killed a brāhmana he may at his will enter a fight and if he werā killed, by his opponents who knew that he was a brāhmana murderer, or even if he was wounded and left unconscious on the field but subsequently recovered he should be free from the sin of brāhmaṇa-murder, 

(3) According to Āp. Dh, S. I. 9.25.13, Vas. 20. 25-26, Gaut, 22.2, Madu XI, 74, Yāj. TIL 247, he may cut off with ano axe his hair, skin, blood, flesh, muscles, fat, bones and marrow and offer them into an ordinary fire kindled by him for the purpose and offer these sight offerings into it for Death 215 (Mrtyu) as the deity and then throw himself into fire (thrice: with head downwards, according to Manu XI. 73). This pen.' ance is for intentional murder of a brāhmapa by a ksatriya aco: to the Madanapārijāta and Bhavisyapurāpa q. by Pr. Prakāśa folio 95 a. 

(4)-(8) The murderer of a brāhmana may perform the Asyamedha sacrifica or Gosava or Abhijit or Visvajit or the threefold Agnistut (Manu XI, 74) The Aśramedha could be performed only by a king or an emperor (samrāj). The others' could be performed by any one belonging to the three higher classes This applies only where the murder was unintentional as stated by Kullūka following the Bhavisyapurāna,216" Vispu*

(9) Manu XL 75 provides that for the removal of the sin of brahmahatya, the sinner may walk one hundred yojanas, sub sisting on limited food, controlling his senses and reciting one of the four Vedas, Kullūka says that this appjies only where she killing is unintentional and the victim is a mere brāhmana by caste (i. e, has not studied the Veda &c.).

This is the view of Govindananda. But tha Mit, on Yaj. II. 250 appears to hold that Nos 10 and 11 are not separate penances It combines the two into one, viz. that if the murderer has no offspring then he was to donate all his wealth or if he had offspring he was to donate a bouse with paraphernalia. This explanation is certainly preferable, The Smrtyarthasāra (p 105) states that if the murderer is devoid of qualities but is well-off he may give a house and lands suficient for the maintenance of a worthy brāhmana or he may donate a house with appurtenances or if he be childless all his wealth.

ghee) should follow the course of the (holy ) river Sarasvati in all its branches. This, acc. to the Bhavisyapurāna and Kullūka, applies where a mere brahmana by caste (without Vedic learning) is killed intentionally by a man who is himself rich but has no vedic learning. The words 'pratisrotah sarasvatim' have been variously explained. Medhātithi explains as above. Apararka, Barvajianārāyana and Raghavānanda explain that the murderer should follow the course of the Sarasvati in the opposite direc tion from the sea to its origin. This appears to be a better explanation, since it brings out the force of 'pratisrotah' more clearly, 

(13) It is provided by Manu XL, 77 and Yāj. II. 249 that the murderer should recite in a forest thrica the sainhatā text of the Veda, while subsisting on limited food. The express mention of samhita text precludes the pada text or krama. The Bhavisyapurada and Kullūka hold that this ponance is proper where a mere brahmana by birth (without Vedic learning ) is killed unintentionally. 

Manu XI. 79, Yāj. III, 244 and 246, Vas, 20.27-28 and Gaut. 2%, 7-8 and 11 mention three more penances, but they are not independent ones ( as is made clear by Sankha). If a murderer, while undergoing the 12 years' penance, fights hin who attacks a brāhmana and saves him (or fights for the king, acc. to Vas.) or dies in the attempt, he becomes at once free from the sin and if he lives after the fight he had not to continue the penance for the whole period. The same applies to the saving of 12 cows by the murderer by putting his own life in danger219, Similarly, if a murderer fights & marauder depriving a brahmana of all his wealth and restores the wealth to 2 brāhmana or dies in the atterapt or is severely wounded (thrice acc. to Yāj, Vas and Gaut.) and is unable to restore the wealth to the brābmana he becomes free from the grave sin of brahmapa murder.

Yaj. DI. 245 provides that if the murderer treats and cares a brahmana or a cow (or cows ) lying helpless on the public road suffering from a long-standing and serious ailment he becomes free from the sin,

age at the time of finishing twelve years and 120 years (which is regarded as the highest limit of life ). If a person strikes & brahmana intending to kill him but only injures him he should perform the vrata for brahmahatyā (acc. to Yāj. II, 252, Gaut, 22.11). The Mit. explains that this is an extension (atrdeśa) of the rules about brahmahalyā and so the penance is a little Joss than the full one (i. o. 9 years). Where certain sins aro said to be equal / sama ) to bralımahatya or surāpāna, the penance for them is half of what is prescribed for the latter. If a person intending to commit suicide by entering water or fire or by hanging himself or by taking poison or by falling from a precipice or the dome of a temple or by cutting his belly with a weapon or by fasting, does not dia, but luckily lives, he has to undergo a prayascitta for three years (acc. to Pr. Prakarana p. 15). Vas. 23, 18-19 and Parāśara XII.5-8 prescribe other prāyascittas for such persons (who are styled 'pratyjavasita'). Pr. Prakarana (p. 15 ) and Pr. V. (P. 75 ) quote two verdes of Yama 22la for nine kinds of pratyavasıta and prescribe Candrāyana or two Taptakrcchras for them. 

If a ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra intentionally and directly killed a brahmana, the expiation was death, but otherwise each had respectively to undergo twice, thrice or four times as much prāyascitta as a brāhmana sinner would have had to undergo for killing a brahmana,322 Conversely, if a brābmana killed a ksatriya or vaisya or a sūdra the sin was only an upapātaka (acc. to Yāy. II, 236 and Manu XI, 66), unless the ksatriya or vaišy& victim was engaged in performing a soma sacrifice (Šāmavidhāna Br, I, 7, 5, Yāj. ITI 251, Vas, 20. 34) when the penance was heavy. Yāj. IUI, 266-267, Manu XI, 126-130 and Āp. Dh. S. 1.9.24. 1-4 prescribe other penances for killing a ksatriya, a vaišya or & sūdra. The penance for a ksatriya

History of Dharmatastra . killing a ksatriya is a little less (i. e. by ?) than the penance for a brāhmapa killing a ksatriya Vide the verse 'vipra tu. sakalam deyam' quoted above (note 192 ). 

Women victims were placed on the same footing as ksatriya, vaisya and südra males (Yāj, III, 236 and Manu XI 66), except the cases where the woman was an Atreyi or pregnant or in her monthly illness (Gaut 22 17, Āp Dh, S. I. 9. 24. 5 and 9, Baud, Dh. 'S, II, 1.10, 12–13, Vas 20 34, Visnu Dh. S. 50 7-9) or the wife of a twice-born performing a soma sacrifice, when the penance was heavy (like the one for brahmahatya) The period of soma-yāga was reckoned from the Diksaniya isti to the Udavasāniyā (acc to the Mit ) or up to the end of avabhrtha bath (acc. to Apararka). Tor killing women guilty of adultery the ponances were higher and varied according to the caste of the paramour and of the woman (vide Gaut 22.26-27, Manu XI. 138, Yāj III. 268-269). 

Manu (XI. 208–Visnu Dh, S 54 30) and Yaj II, 293 prescribe that for threatening to beat or strike a brāhmana the penance is kṛochra, for striking him it is Ati-krochra, for shedd ing his blood a Krcchra and Atikrcchra. The Samaridhāna Br. 1.7. 4 prescribes other penances (i. e. recitation of certain sāman texts) for those. 

Gaut. 23.1, 22 Ap Dh S. I 9 25.3, Baud. Dh. S. I. 1. 21., Vas. 20.22, Manu X. 90-91, Yā).

Some like Haradatta on Gaut. 23 1 hold that this horrible ponance is meant for one who knowingly and repeatedly drinks sura (man ufactured from rice flour). Manu XL 92 and Yāj. II. 254 prescribe another penance in place of the one ending in death viz, that the sinner should eat during one year (during three

The same rules apply to a ksatriya or vaisya drinking sura (manufactured from rice flour). Only they have as stated above (in nots 192) to undergo three-fourths and one-half respectively of the penance for a brābmapa sinner, This penance was to be undertaken after vomiting the contents of the stomach. According to the Madanapārijāta (p. 818), Pr. V. p 104, Pr Prakarana p. 43, Mit. (on Yāj III. 24) and other works the twelve years' penance is meant for one who drinks Surā (made from flour) through ignoranca or forcs. According to Gaut 23, 2-3, Yaj. II 255, Manu, XI, 146, Atri 75, for drink ing intoxicants or human semen, ordure or urine through ignorance a person of the three first classes had first to undergo the panance called Taptakrcchra and then his upanayana was again performed. Vasistha 20.19 prescribes for drinking any intoxicant unintentionally the panances of Krcchra and Atikrochra, the drinking of ghee and the performing of upanayana again. There is great divergence of views about Madu XI, 146 and Yāj III 255 which is passed over here, Brhaspati 224 quoted by the Mit, Aparārka and others prescribes that a brāhmapa who drinks surā prepared from raw sugar, flour and honey (or madhūka flowers) should respectively undergo Taptakrcchra, Parāka and Candrayana. This light penance is restricted acc. to the Mit, and others to cases where suā is drunk for curing a malady which no other medicine could ourd. If a brālmana drank sura (not manufactured from flour) or any other intoxicant, various easy penanons were prescribed for him (such as undergoing Candrāyapa on a river falling into the sea, feeding brāhmanas and donating a cow and a bull to the brābmapas, Parāśara XII 75-76). Vide Yāj. III. 255 and the Mit thereon. Ksatriyas and vaisyas incurred no sin by drinking intoxicants other than sura (made from flour) and the sūdra incurred no sin even by drinking surā of the

The Pr. V (p. 104) and Ps.

Vasistha 20.18 quotes Menu XI, 151 on this point 228 and Visnu (Dh, S. 51.4-5) in prose is to the same effect. Visnu (Dh S' 51. 2-3 ) provides Candrayana for drinking any of the (twelve ) unclean excretions of the body (Manu V. 134 ) or any of the several kinds of intoxicating drinks and for eating garlic or onion or red garlic or any plant having a similar flavour or the flesh of village pigs, of fame cooks, of apas and of cows and then adds (in sūtra 4) that they (the sinners) must undergo fresh upangyana also The surtis provide different prāyascittas for various lapses about drinking and eating such as drjnking vater from a pot which had already been used for holding surā, for drinking water from the water vessel of a cāndāla or of a washerman or from a sūdra's house or for drinking milk which should not be drunk (Gaut 17.22-26, Yaj 1.170, Manu V. 8-10), for eating forbidden food, which must be passed over bere, because 229 they are too many and too various and depend on circumstances for their application as observed by the Pr. V and because they are now of academic interest alone. Some reference, however, may be made to show how some of these lapses were treated. Sankha states that there are many articles that are allowed or forbidden to men, particularly to brahmanas and in cases of transgressions the decision tests with the sustas (the pareşad of respectable people). Brhaspati 230 (quoted by Apararka) prescribes that in the case of the partaking of things that should not be licked or drunk or eaten or in case of taking in human semen, urine or ordure, the penance of & cāndrāyana is the purification Some of the sages such as Samyarta, Sankha-likhita took a lenient view, prescribed Candrāyada even for eating cow's flesh and human flesh 231

Tho gonoral rule stated by thio Sama Br. I 513, Manu XI, 160 and others is that one dosirous of inner purity should not eat forbiddon food, that if he eats it through ignorance he should make efforts to vomit it and if that is impossible he should quickly take some prāyaścitta (which is slight in the case of ignorance ). It may be montioned that even from very ancient times exceptions were recognised to the prohibitions against the partaking of forbidden food The Chāndogya Upanisad (I, 10 )287 narrates the story of Usasti Cakrāyana, who when the country of tho Kurus had been devastated by hailstones (or by locusts ), begged (along with his very young wife ) of a chief eating boans and took from the latter the beans that had been put away for the chiof (and so were ucchista), but when asked to take water for drinking meant for the chief replied that if he drank of it he would be drinking wliat was unclean, since he could get water whenever he liked. This Vedic passage indicates that oven unclean things may be eaten when there is distress (īpad) or danger to life, but that when there is no distress or danger even one who has knowledge of or ahmavidyā should not violate the injunctions of śāstra about eating. The Vedāntasūtra (III.428) has an aphorism on this incident Manu X.104 provides that he who, when in danger of losing his life, accepts food from any parson whatsoever is not tainted by sin as the sky is not tainted by mua Manu then refers (X 105-108) to the stories of Ajigarta who, when fanished, approached for slaying his own son, of the sage Vāmadeva who when tormented by hunger desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life and did not sully himself, of Bharadvāja who when distressed by hunger along with his son in a lonely forest accepted many cows from the carpenter Vrdhu (Brbu?) or of Vispāmitra who, well knowing what was right or wrong, proceeded, whon tormented by hunger, to eat the haunch of & dog, receiving it from the hands of a Capdāla 2324

For eating the flesh of various birds Vispu Dh, S. 51. 29 and 31 and others prescribe fasting for three days or one day and also for eating several varieties of fish (Visnu 51.21). 

We may not revert to the penances for the other Mahā. pātakas. It has already been seen how the thief that had stolen a brāhmana's gold of a certain weight was to approach the king with a club (p. 73 above). Even Ap.Dh. S, I9,25.4 refers to this and prescribes as an option (Ap Dh. S. 1.9 23.6-7) entering into fira as an expiation for theft or starving oneself by reducing the intake of food. Therefore, the penance for the theft of brahmana's gold of the weight of 80 rahtikās or more (Manu VIII, 134 and Yā] 1,363) was death for the offenders of all varpas, except a brāhmana offender, who clad in rags (or bark garment) was to undergo a penance in a forest for twelve years of the same kind as for brāhmana murder (Manu XI, 101) or for the drinking of salā prepared from flour (Vāj III. 258 ). The offender may also give as much gold (if he is rich) as his own weight or as much wealth as would be required for the maintenance of a brāhmana's family for the latter's lifetime (Yā). III 258 and Mit. thereon) The Āp Dh, S. I. 9 258 provides the observance of the penance of Krochra for one year (as defined in Āp Dh. S I 9 27 7–8) and quotes a verse ''those who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous liquor, or had connection with a guru's wife, but not those who have slain a brāhmaua, shall eat every fourth meal-tinje a little food, bathe thrice a day, pass the day standing and the night sitting; after the lapse of three years they cast off their sins."2325 The digests contain numerous and varying expiations for theft depending upon the weight of gold stolen, upon the qualities of the man robbed and of the thief, upon the caste of both, upon whether it is a first offence or a repeated one, on the price and natura of the thing stolen and on the time and place and so on Vide Pr V. pp. 117-127, Pr. Sāra p 49, Madanapīrijāta pp 828-834, Smrtyarthasāra pp. 108-109, Smrtimuktāphala pp 883-885. These have to be passed over here for reasons of space.

or any other non-brahmana, the expiation would be as one for an upapātaka Manu (XI 162--168 =Matsyapurana 227, 41-47) and Visnu 52. 5-13 prescribe various penances such as krochra for a year for the theft of corn or cooked food or wealth; cāndrāyana for abducting men and women (slaves) or for appropriating a field or liouse and the water of wells and cisterns; santapana for thefts of objects of small value; pancagavya for stealing eatables of various kinds or a vehicle or a bed or a seat or flowers or roots and fruits, fasting for three days and nights in the case of theft of grass, food, trees, dry food, molasses, clothes, leather (or armour) and flesh, subsisting for twelve days on small grains of rice for stealing gems, pearls, coral, copper, silver, iron, bell-retal or stones, subsisting on milk alona for the theft of cotton, silk, vool, animals with cloven hoofs (cows &c.) or uncloven hoofs (horses &c), birds, perfumes, medicinal herbs or a rope (used for drawing water). It must be remembered as stated above (p. 74) that the thief had to restore to the owner the thing stolen and then undergo a penance (Manu XI.164 and Visou Dh S 58.14) and Medhātithi (on Manu XI. 164) adds that if he is unable to restore the thing (or its price) the penance is to be double. Besides, in certain cases of theft if corporal punishment or death was not inflicted by the king, the thief vas fined eleven times the price of the thing stolen (Manu VIII, 321, 323, Vienu Dh S. 5,82) 233 

Steija (theft) is of two kinds, by force (such as robbery and dacoity and called sālasa) and by clandestine means. In the fornier case the penance goes on increasing (twice, thrice) according as the offender is a ksatriya or raišya (parsadya brālimanünün, quoted above, Par. M. I part 1 p.231) In the Cuse of theft by clandestine means if the owner wliose gold or wealth is stolon is a brahmana and the thief a ksatriya or vaisya, then also the penance must be bigher than for a brāhmana thjef (since, as, Nārada says in his chapter on sāhasa verse 16, the pealth belonging to idols, brāhmapas and kings is the bast) But conversely, if the owner of stolen property is of lower class than the thiof then the verse of Brhad-Vignu ('vipre tu sakalam deyam,' quoted above in note 192) will apply.

Penance for incest

become three are no hot iron im penance. There penance cream 

The penance for incest with the guru's wife was prescribed from very ancient tines as follows: Gaut. 234 23, 8-11, Ap. Dh. S. 1.9.25.1-2, Baud, Dh. S. II. 1. 14-16 (almost in the same words as in Gaut), Vas. 20. 13-14, Manu XI. 103-104 prescribe that the offender shall confess his guilt and then extend himself on a red-hot iron bed or embrace the red-lot iron image of a woman or having himself cut off his organ and testicles and having taken them in his joined hands may walk straight towards the south or south-Test until he falls down dead and that he becomes purified by death. According to the Mit, on Yāj. TIL 259 the three are not distinct penances, but that two of them, viz, embracing the red-hot irou image of a woman and sleeping on a bed of red hot iron form one penance. The words of Yāj. no doubt contey that the two together are one penance ( viz. sleeping on red hot bed and clinging to a red hot image ). Others like the Madanapārijāta. (p. 837), Medhātithi 235 on Manu XI. 103 do not accept this interpretation. The latter moreorer relies on Gautama who employs the word 'ya' (or) in the two latter of his three sütras on this point, The Pr. V. (p. 138) points out this difference between Gaut. and Yāj. Manu XI. 58 and 170–71, Yāj. N. 231, Samyarta 159 regard sexual intercourse with a friend's wife or a maiden of a higher caste and the wives of one's son or of sagotras and women born of the same womb (sister &c.) or with an antyaja Voman as equal to gurutalpagamana and the penance is only a little less than for the latter. Manu XI. 103 and Yā). III. 260 prescribe a penance (other than one ending in death), viz. that the singer should dwell in a tenantless forest, allow his beard to grow, should trear tattered garments and practise Prājāpatya Kpochra for one year (tliree years acc. to Yāj.). The commentators say that this was meant where the sin pas committed by mistake, Manu XI. 106 and Yāj. IL 260 provide another penance viz. Cāndrāyana for three inonths, Manu prescribing that the sinner should subsist on sacrificial food (fruits, roots or nivõra grain) or on barley gruel and Yāj. adding that he should recite for the three months the Vedasambit. The commentators say that this applies in casos khera the guru's wife is of a lower yarna or of the sūdra class,

[Vol. Parāgara (X 10-11) provides three different prāyascittas, viz. excision of the organ, three hrochu as or three cāndı āyanas if a man commits incest with his mother, sister, or daughter and in X. 12-14 prescribes other penances for adultery with other near female relatives The Mit on Yā). III 259 quotes Sankha for twelve years' penance for all four kinds of Mahāpātakas, which applies acc to it to intercourse with guru's wife of the same class. It is not necessary to quote further smrti passages which vary greatly as to the extent of the penance Manu XI 178(= Vispu Dhs 53. 9 = Agnipurāna 169 41), Santi 165 29 state that the sin which a twice-born man com mits by sexual intercourse for one night with a vrsali 236 (a cāndāla woman) is removed by him by the penance of subsist ing on almos for three years and reciting mantras (like the Gāyatri). Āp. Dh S. I 9 27. 11 has a somewhat similar verse about a brāhmana's intercourse with a šūdra woman237. Yaj III, 233 prescribes for women death as a legal penalty and the same prāyaścitta as for a male if a man has sexual intercourse with his paternal or maternal aunt, or daughter-in-law, matei nal uncle's wife and others ( enumerated above) with their consent Manu XI, 175 (= Laghu-Satātapa 155 = Agaipurāda 169 38) holds that a brāhmana, who has sexual intercourse with a cāndāla woman or mleccha woman or dines with candālas or mlecchas or accepts gifts from them, has to perform penance ag if he were patta if he unknowingly did these things, and be comes like them by committing thesa sins knowingly Coni pare Vasistha 23 41, Visvu Dh.

If a wonian be guilty of a Mahāpātaka the general rule stated by Manu XT 176 (latter half), Kātyāyana and Brhaspatı23 was that whatever penance was prescribed for a male in casos of adultery with other's wives the same was to be adminis tered to women in case of adultery with males. In this parti

Prāyaścitta for adulteress 

105 

cular case the rule about half panance being prescribed for women did not hold good when a woman with full knowledge committed adultery and half panance was to be prescribed only where the adultery was through mistake, A. similar rule was laid down by Angiras 23. If a woman became patita and did not undergo frīgaścitta she could be excommunicated by the process called ghatasphota (described in'H. of Dh, vol. III pr. 615-616 and 1009). But there was a difference between a male and a woman in this respact. A wawan, however, was not to be altogether abandoned on the street and left to fare for herself, though she be patita, but she was to be lodged in a cottage thatched with grass near the house and was to be guarded against further lapses and given bare maintenance ( enough to keep body and soul together) and (dirty) clothes (Yā), IL 296, Manu XI. 176). Thera vera certain acts, however, which were specially condemned in women (Vāj. III, 297) viz, sexual intercourse with a man of a lower class, causing abortion and killing the husband. Vas. 21, 10 provides 339 that four olasses of women may be altogether abandoned (and not given even starving maintenance &c) viz, a woman who has sexual intercourse with her husband's) pupil or with his guru or one who kills her husband or one who sexually approaches a man of a lower degraded class. Women, however patita they may be, were to be dealt with as stated in Yāj. II 296 even if they did hot perform any penance Vas. 21.12 states that women of the brahmana, ksatriya and Taiśya classes, if guilty of sexual intercourse with a šūdra, can be purified by penanos if they do not give birth to a child, but not those others (who give birth to a child born of the condemned connection). Vida H. of Dk, vo). III. pp. 946-949 for penance and other matters in relation to adultery by men and women. 

It is now necessary to turn to the penance for association with those that are guilty of grave sins (rahāpatakas), Manu XT. 181, Visou Db, S. 54 1, Yay. III 261 provide that whoever associates with (for a year, acc. to Yāj.) a person guilty of one

Vispu DI S (chap 36) speaks of certain sins as anupīlakas which are declared by Manu (XI 55-58) and Yāj (IL 228-33) to be equal to or like one or other of the mahāpātakas and provides that those guilty of them become pure by Aśramedho sacrifice or by resorting to pilgrimages It has also been seen that such sins are removed by the penances that are slightly less (i. e, by Ith) than those for the mahāpātakas themselves 

The penances for upapātahas must now be briefly dealt with. The number of apapatakas is very large and it is of no practical importance to deal with each of them separatels First of all, some general rules about them will be stated and

Penances for upapātakas 

& few of them that are of some importance will be dealt with individually. The Samaridhāna 243 Br. (L 5.14) states that on committing several upapātakas a man becomes pure by reciting thrice the whole of the veda while fasting. Manu XI. 117, Yāj. IIL 265, Visnu Dh, S. 37 35 prescriba that purification from all classes of upapātakas (except the sin of the avalcīrnin) is effected by the same penances that are prescribed for govadha or by cāndrāyana or by subsisting on milk alone for a month or by Parāka or Gosava. The digests prescribe that Parāka is meant for him who is strong enough to undertake it, Cāndrāyana for him who is weak, Gosava for him who repeatedly commits the same upapātaka or is guilty of several at the same time (vide Pr. Prakāśa, folio 12% a). 

Govadha stands at the head of upapātakas in Manu, Yāj., the Agnipurāna (168 29-37). Several smrtis provide different penances for the sin of killing a cow. Gaut, 22.18 prescribes244 the same penance for govadha as for killing a paisya (Gaut. 22. 15) viz. staying for three years in a forest, subsisting on alms, observing celibacy and donating one hundred cows toge ther with a bull. In Āp. Dh, S. 1. 9. 26. 1 for killing a milch OOW or a full grown ox the penance is said to be the same as for killing a šūdra Vas, 21. 18 provides that if a man kills a Gow he should cover himself with the raw bide of the cow (that is killed) and should observe Krcchra or Atikrochra for six months. Manu 245 XI, 108-116, Vispu Dh. S, 50, 16-24, Sam Varta 130-135, Parāśara VII. 31-41 (q. in Smrtimuktāphala p. 875, prāyaścitta section) prescribe elaborate observances as penances for govadha Yāj. (IIL 263–264) provides four sepa rate prāyasoittas, viz (1) the killer of a cow should control his senses for a month, should subsist on pascagavya (cow's urine, cow-dung, milk, curds and ghee), should sleep in a cowpon, should follow the cows so penned (by day) and at the end of a month donate a cow; (2) or he should perform Krochra penance while sleeping in a cow-pon and following cows by day; (3) or should perform an alkrochra in the same way; (4) or should fast for three days and donate tan cows together with

Sankha provides 216 that the killer of a cow should fast for 25 days and nights subsisting on pañcagayya, should tonsure his head together with the top-knot, should wear as an upper garment cow-hide and should follow cows, lie down in a cow-pen and donate a coy. Some of the smrtis and digests declare that the penance differed according as the cow that was killed belonged to a learned brāhmana or to a mere brāhmana by caste, to a ksatriya or vaisya or sūdra For example, Davala (q. by Pr. V. p 202) states that if a cow belonging to a brah mapa were killed, then the sinner should wear as upper garment that cow's hide for six months, should bring fodder for cows, should imitate cows, should subsist on barley gruel, should move among cows and then he becomes free fion the sin, Sātātapa (q. by Pr V. p 203) states that one kıllıng the cow of a yaisya should subsist on pañcagavya for a month, should recite the Gomati-vidya 217 and stay in a cowpen for a month, Visva mitra (Pr. V. p 203) says about the killer of a cow belonging to a südra that he should undergo four krochras if he kills intentionally and two if unintentionally. The Gomati-vidyā as quoted by Aparārka (p. 1102), the Madana-pārijāta (p. 862) and Pr T. p 522 (which takes it from the Prāyaścitta section of the Kalpataru that takes it from Yama) is a laudation of cows: 'cows always emit fragrance, they liave the sinell of guggulu (bdellium), they are the support of beings, they are a great blessing, cows are (yield in their milk) the best food and the best offerings for gods; they are purifiers of all beings and offerings ooze from them; they please the gods in heaven by the offerings (of milk and ghee) that are rendered pure by the mantras recited over them; in the agnihotra (keeping up the sacred fire) of sages cows help

The Pr. prakarana 218 (p 33) says that Katyāyana, Gautania, Samyarta, Parāśara and other sages prescriba differing penances for govadha, which are to be explained away by reference to the killing being intentional or unintentiona) or to the fact of the cow being owned by a brāhmapa engaged in a some sacrifice or by a brālimana who has studied the Veda with the six auxiliary śāstras, or by the fact that the coly was useful for the roma of a brāhmada possessad of good qualities or was a preguant cow or of the hapila (brown or tatny) Fariety.

This applies as an exception in all cases of injury or death of brāhmanas, cots or other animals Parāśara (IX. 4 ff ) and Angiras (q by Pr. 1, pp 526-527) prescribe 1, and of the prayascitta for killing out-right a cow, if the death is due to putting an obstacle in the cow's or bull's free movement or to tying it up or to yoking it with thongs.

(Vol. 

The Samayidhāna Br (I 7.8 ) prascribes that on killing any animal (except a cow or bull) the guilty person should fast for one night and recite the sāmaveda verse 'Agnis-tigmena' (I 1 32) Ap. Dh S (I 9.25.14) provides for killing a crow, a chameleon, & peacock, a chaki avāka, hamsa, bhāsa, a frog, ichneumon, musk-rat, a dog the same penance as for killing a südra Gaut 22 19-22, 24–25, Manu XI. 133-137, Yā) III. 269-274, Visnu Dh, $ 50,25-32, Parāšara VL 1-15 prescribe several ponances for killing an elephant, & horse, a tiger, a monkey, a cat, a serpant and numerous other animals, whioh are passed over here Some smrtis such as Samyarts 10 and Paithinasi make a difference between grāmya and aranya (forest) animals, in each class seven being specificed by Paithidasi 21 The great concern of the sages for anything possessed of the principle of life or growth went so far as to prescribe the ponance of reciting one hundred rk verses if a man cut off big trees (like mango or jack-fruit tree) or shrubs and creepers, except for purposes of sacrifices or agriculture 252 (Manu XI. 142, Yāy TIL 276, Vas 19. 11-12). These provisions tended against wanton destruction of trees, shrubs and forests that are so beneficent to humanity and lend a charm to the landscape, 

It is remarkable that in case a man was bitten by a harlok or a monkey or an ass or by a dog or jackal or a camel or a crow he had to perform (in addition to the pain of the bite) prānāyāna while standing in water and to drink ghee for purification (Manu XI. 199, Yā). III. 277, Vas 23, 31) Parašara V 1-9 prescribe elaborate rules of purification for bites by wolves, doga and jackals (such as a bath and Japa of Gāyatri &c). 

PARADARYA (adultery with another's wife)-is a minor sin (acc to Yāj III, 235, Manu XT. 59). This excludes inter course with guru's wife and other intercourse declared to be like gurutal pagamana or with candāla women (Mapu XI. 170-17%, 175, 178, Yaj III 231-233, Vas XX. 15-17 and XXI, 41) Ap.

(I, 10.28,20) provides that if a wifo plays false to her husband she should perform for as many months (i. e, six months) the twelve night krcchra penance, In another place Ap. Dh. S. (IL 10. 27, 11) states that if a brahmana commits adultery once with a married woman of equal class he shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for an outcast. Gaut (2% 29-30, 34) provides penances for two years generally and three years if the woman be the wife of a learned brābmana. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 265 quotes numerous texts dealing with the penanc for adultery that does not amount to a mahāpātaka and tries to evolve order by assigning to each its proper province. This is passed over here. A woman guilty of adultery with a male of the saine or higher caste than herself had to undergo the same penance as a malo adulterer (Manu XI 176 and Bphaspati), but if she committed adultery with a male of lower caste, then the penances differed as stated above (vide Vas, 21, 1-5 and Sarvarta 167-172), Brhadyama IV.48 states that adultery in the inverse order of olasses is a grave sin, but adultery in the anuloma order of classes entails different penances for purification from it.253 

Vrātyatā (failure to have upanayapa performed at the right time) person whose upanayana is not performed at the proper time is called vrātya or patitasāvitriha. Vide Asv. gr. I 19. 5-7, Ap Dh.

XI. 76-79, Gaut. 198) are prescribed by some of these works, while Mann XI. 191 (=Visdu Dh, S. 54, 26-27=Agni purāna 170.8-9) prescribes a milder penance of three krochias and then Upanayana is to be performed again. Vas. XI. 77 describes Uddalakavrata as follows: 'for two months he should subsist on barley gruel, for a month on milk, for half a month on āmiksā, for eight days on ghee, for six days on food obtained without begging or asking for it, for three days on vater and he should observe a complete fast for one day.'

Dh S, and Par gr furnish elaborate details. The former states that the Pasupurodāśa may be offered to Raksas or to Yama or he may offer on the Amāyāsyā at night two offerings of clarified butter in fire after parforming the preparatory rites of a darvi homa and that he may then invoke fire with the verse (Tai, A. II 18) 'Sam mā cincantu marutah &c.' (may the Maruts grant me long life and strength). 

If an ascetic reverted to the life of a householder, Samyaita (171-172) prescribes the penance of krcchra for six months 257, Such a man is called pratyavasıta. The pratyavasitas are said to be of nine kinds 258 by Yama (22-23), Bșhad-Yaba (3-4) and others viz, those who turn back from water, fire, halter by means of which they wanted to kill themselves), those who revert back from the stage of sannijāsa or from a fast (unto death), or from poison, precipice or sitting dharna and those who (desiring to coinmit suicide) strike themselves with a weapon (but are not killed), these pine are called pratyavasıta and are beyond commerce with people, become pure by the penance of Candrāyana or two Taplakrcchras. Vrddha-Parāśara quoted by Par. M, and Prayascitta-inuktāvali provides that sandyāsins, who revert to the life of the householder, are to be treated as cāndālas even after undergoing penance and their children born after they fall from the fascetic stage are to be made to dwell among cāndalas. This explains the harsh treatinent alleged to have been meted to the great saint Jñanośvara and his brothers at Paithan in the 13th century.

Elaborate purifications are prescribed for renioving the tait of touching ceitain men, unclean objects like bones (Manu V. 87), women in their monthly illness or within certain days alter delivery and animals (like dogs, village pigs, cocks, crows). They have to be passed over here for reasons of space. But a feir passages may be cited by way of sample. Gautama 253 (14,38) provides that on touching palta, cāndāla, a woman fresh) delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpse, or on touch ing any one who has touched any one of these or any one who is the third in contact, the purification is brought about by a bath with the clothes on. Maru V. 81 and Yāj III 30 contain similar provisions The Pr. V. (pp. 495–199) discusses the question whether spar sa 260 (touch) means direct touch or includes even indirect touch and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that indirect touch also is included and cites Āpastanla-smrti in support that if a brāhmana and a candāla or the lıke aro both seated on the seme branch (without actually touching each other) the brāhmana can become purified only by a bath. A rerse quoted as Yājāavalkya's by Pr. Prakarana 351 p. 110 (not found in the printed text) states. 'on touching a cāndāla, pukkass, mleocha, bhilla, a pārasika (one coming from Persia) and the like and persons guilty of grave sins one should bathe with the clothes on.'

115 Bath for fouching certain persons 

Bauddhas, Pasupatas, Laukāyatikas, atheists and those who follow forbidden aotions, one should plunge in water together with the clothes on. On touching a cartya tree (such as a sig tree round which a platform is built), a funeral pile (or brick altar prepared in the srauta rits called Agnicayana), a sacrificia) post, a cāndāla, one who sells the soma plant, a brāhmana should enter water with the clothes on.' Samyarta 263 requires a drija to sip water on touching a shoemaker, a washerman, a zena (Manu X 19, 49, one who beats drum &c.), a fisherman, a dancer (nata) and Sātātapa 26 provides that if any liub of a duija (except the head) is touched by one who colours clothes, a shoemaker, a hunter, a fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a thaha (Thug), an actor, one who allows sexual intercourse in the mouth, a dog, a prostitute allowing men of all varpas to visit her, an oil-grinder, the keeper of a tavern, an executioner, a village pig or cock, he should wash the limb with water and perform ācamana. If the head is touched by any one of these, then he should bathe. In this connection it may be noted that Hemādri quotes (on p. 38) the Garudapurāna and (on p. 316) Parāśara for the 16 castes in a village that were treated as cāndalas jn the matter of touch, speech or sight. Devala (q. by Hemādri on prāyaścitta p. 312) says that Capdāla and Turuska (Turk) are equally low. The chapter on untouchables in the 2nd rol. of the H. of Dh pp. 165–179 may be consulted in this connection. On pp. 175-176 of the same work references are given to verses of Atri, Satātapa, Brhaspati and others stating that no purification is required on the ground of untouchability in the case of religious festivals and marriage processions, in hattle, in the case of fire or invasion and similar calamities. By po stretch of imagination can these verses be restricted to the untouchability arising from death or birth as some propose

Penance for selling certain things 

male slaves, elephants, horses, bulls, fragrant substances, liquids, silken cloth (ksauma), black antelope hide, soma plant, water, in digo; by selling these he at once incurs sin. As penance he should practise Tapła-krcchra for a year after tonsuring his head, he should enter water thrica, wear only ons wet piece of cloth, should observe silence, should practise the Virāsana, should sit up at night and stand by day, should recite the Gayatri. 

One important matter dealt with by a few of the smrtis and some of the digests is the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those who were converted by force by the invading mlecchas. About the ineaning of the word mleccha, there is some diver gence of views. From the Sat. Br. (IHL. 21 23-24) it appears that the mlecchas spoke a degraded and corrupt speech ( such as saying "helavah' for 'hesrayah'). Parasara (IX. 36) refers to the mlecchas as the eaters of cow's flesh. The Pr. T. (p 549) quotes a smrti 265 text to the effect that a mlecoha is an eater of Cow's flesh and talks much that is contradictory, and cites a passage from the Harivamsa for the manner of the dress and of the trimming of hair in the case of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Pāradas, Pablayas &c. Vide for mleccha and for the return to the Hindu fold of those that ware forcibly carried away as slaves by mlecchas and robbers or made to kill cows or to eat the flesh of asses, camels, village pigs, H. of Dh. vol.

S. VII 6-7, Yāj II 89 declare that what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force and what is caused to be written by force and all transactions whatever that are brought about by force are void, and the burning desire of many people forcibly converted in times of disturbances to return to the Hindu sold and to the religion of their forefathers, the movement now called suddhi should be encouraged by all interested in the well-being and stability of Hindu society It is better to call this return by the name of parāvartana'. A model but brief rite for the par āvar tana of those who were forcibly converted or for those who voluntarily left the Hindu fold but want to return to it is given in the Appendix The same prayoga with suitable changes may be employed for taking into the Hindu fold any one who was not born a Hindu. In ancient times such people appear to have been taken into the Hindu fold by the perfor mance of Vrūtyastoma.

Penances for miscellaneous lapses 

days Those two verses of Manu occur in Agnipurāna (170. 23-25). Vispu Dh. 8. (39,2, 40.2, 415) prescribas somewhat different penances for sankarikarana, apātrikarana or malini karapiya deeds Vide also the Mit on Ya) III, 290 for the penances prescribed for these deeds by Yama and Brhaspati, About miscellaneous pūtahas the rule laid down by Manu XI, 209, Vispu Dh S 422, Yā). III 294 and others is that the penance should be prescribed by the brahmanas after taking into account the nature of the deed, the ability of the perpetrator and other circumstances of time and place &c. 

Some of the digests prescribe certain times for the perform ance of penance. The first rule is laid down by Harita that having done something sinful or improper through trustfulness, affection, greed, fear or heedlessness one should resort to puri fication at once Daksa268 11. 73 also states that all narmadhika and kāmya matters must be performed as they fall due and no delay should be caused. If more than a year is allowed to pass after the sin is incurred the penance vould have to be double of what it otherwise would have been, according to Davala and Manu.26BIT The Pr. T. (pp 474,512) quotes a perse from the Vyavahāra cintamani 269 and an astrological work to the effect that a penance or ordeal should not be administered on the 8th or 14th tithr of a month, nor should an ordeal or marriage take place on a Saturday or Tuesday. The Prayascittendusekhara (P 15) says that according to respectable people (śrstas) the sankalpa (declaration of undergoing a penance) should be made on the 14th titiu and the actual rite should be performed on the amīvūsyā. If the guilty person is in mourning he may perform penance after the period of mourning is over. 

The procedure for undergoing penances for sins and lapses prescribed by the assembly of learned men has varied jn details from time to time. The Gaut. Dh S. 26 6-17 prescribes

the method of performing Krochra penance It is briefly as follotts: The sidder desiring to be free of sin quickls should stand by day and sit up by night (i e. should take sleep in a sitting position and not lie down), he should speak the truth and should not hold conversation with anārijas (sūdras &c), should bathe thrice in the day, should perform mārjana (splash ing or sprinkling water on the head and other limbs by means of kušas dipped in ater after repeating sacred mantras) Frith the three verses 'āpo hi sthā' (Rg. X,9.1–3), with the perses called Pavitrarati and with the eight Terses beginning with ‘hirapfararpah sucayaḥ pārakāh' (Tai. S 1.6 1.1-8) Then he should perform the tru pana 270 (satiating with water) with thirteen mantras beginning with namah and ending with namah (each respectirely containing 6, 4, 4, 13, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 7, 2, 6, names of deities) This constitutes for him the worship of Aditya (the Sun) and be offers oblations of clarified butter with these thirteen mantras and, after he passes twelve days in this vay, on the 13th he offers nine oblations of boiled rice to Agni, Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, the Price Darvas, Brahman, Prajāpati, Agni Syistakrt Then he serres dinner to brābmadas The Āp. Dh. S II, 6 15.9 states 21 the general rule that in a]] religious observances one should give dinner to brāhmadas that are pure (in conduct) and that hare studied the Veda. The Baud Dh S. (I. I. 95-99) prescribes that in a krcchra penance one has to bathe thrice in the day, to jie dorsa on the ground (not on a cot &c), to rear only one piece of cloth, to shave one's hair on the head, the moustache and the body and to pare one's nails, and that the same mode is prescribed also for women (sinners) except the topsure of the head Manu (XI. 222-225) prescribes that in all penances there is homa Tith the malāryābrtis erery day, the singer has to practise ahinsa (non-injury to all sentient beings), truthfulness, absence of anger and straight-forwardness, has to bathe thrice by day and thrica by night together with the clothes on, he should not talk with women, sūdras and patitas, he should stand by day and sit down at night or if unable to do so he should sleep on the ground (raised platform called sthandila), should observe celibacy and the rules of a student, such as wearing girdle of nunja grass and carrying 3 staff (of palāśa &c), should honour gods, brāhmanas and his elders, should always recite the Gāyatri and sacred testa.

Procedure of penances 

121 

Vas, 24.5 (a long prose passage) contains similar provisions. Yaj II, 312-13 are very important. They prescribe the practice of certain virtues and rules of conduct called yamas (such as brahmacaryja, kindliness, forbearance, truthfulness, ahinsa &c.) and nyamas (such as bath, silenc3, fasting, purity of body &c.) as necessary adjuncts in all penances. The Laugāksigihya (V. 3-11) prescribes the procedure for all penances Yāj. IL, 325 holds that one should, while performing the penance of krcchra or cāndrāyapa, bathe thrice daily, recite holy mantras (as stated in Vas 28.11-15) and should eat balls of rica over which the Gāyatri has been recited, Sankha272 (18.12-14) also summarises the different items that have to be gone through in undergoing & penance The Madanapārijāta (pp 781-784), Pr. V. (Pp 503 506), Pr. Sāra (pp 21,22 and 200-203), Pr. T. pp. 497-510, 523-524, Pr. Mayükha pp. 18-21, Pr. Prakasa (folios 38b to 43b), Prāgascittendusekhara (pp. 15 and 88) and other works provide elaborate rules about the procedure of undergoing prayascittas. It is not possible nor necessary to set out these in detail here. Briefly put, on the day previous to the actual day of commencing panance the sinner should pareʻhis nails, shave his head, bathe with clay, cow-dung, holy water &c, drink clarified butter, make a declaration of performing the penance indicated by the assembly of learned men. On the next day he should bathe, perform śrāddha, drink pancagavya, should perform homa, give dalışınā (gold, cows &c.) to the brāhmadas and feed them. Parāśara (XI. 3) says that at the end of the rite of penance pañca gayya should be taken and one, two, three or four cows should be donated respectively by a brāhmana, a ksatriya, a vaiśya and a südra. Yama (verse 63) says that brāhmadas should be fed on the performance of a penance and a daksidā of one golden māsa should be given to each brāhmana, Jābali says that at the beginning and close of all penances the sinner should offer in the smārta fire oblations of clarified butter to the accompani ment of the Vyāhrtis, perform śrāddha and offer daksınā con sisting of a cow or gold. Vide Aparārka (p. 1230) and Par. - 1 I part 2 p, 195 for Jābāli's verses. The Pr Prakāśa (folio 30a) adds that according to the Mahārnaya the number of tūlirli-homas should be 28 or 108.

History of Dhar maśāstra 

[Vol. A few words may be said about the tonsure of the head (vapana or mundana). The Tai Br (15 6.1-2) states273 "The Asuras first shaved the hair on the head, then the moustache and then the armpits, therefore they went down (or with face down. wards) and were defeated, while the gods first shaped the armpits, then the moustache and then the hair on the head' The Pr Prakaśa quotes this passage in a mutilated form and then states that vapana is of three kinds, darva (of the gods), ūsura (of the asuras) and mānusa (of men), that the asura method is condemned, that in consecrating the Vedic fires, in the zśtis and soma sacrifices the daiva method is ordained, while in prāyaścıttas, there being no special vidhi, there is an option. Tonsure of the head is enjoined on several occasions e, g. the Vispupurāna provides 274 'Tonsure should be carried out at Prayaga when on a pilgrimaga, and on the death of one's father or mother, one should not in vain (lightly ) tonsure the head'. To these occasions may be added penances. The idea seems to have been entertained that whataver sin a man commits it becomes centered in the hair, as a verse quoted by the Madanapārijāta and Pr M. states Is Gaut. (273), Vas.76 (245), Baud. Dh. S. (II.1.98-99) and others provide for the tonsure of the hair on the head and lips (except those on the eye-brows, the hair on the trunk and the top knot ). Exceptions were introduced to the rule about tonsure Daksa277 forbade tonsure, the offering of pindas and the carrying of a corpse and all funeral rites to

The Baud, Dh s already referred to prohibits the tonsurs of Fomen in penancos Angiras 163, Āpastanuba-smrti I. 33–34. Brhad-Yama IV.16, Vrddha-Hārita IX 386, Parāśara IX, 54-55, Yama 54-55 provide 278 that in the case of married women whose husbands are alive and in the case of maidens all their hair should be held together and only two finger-breadths of hair should be cut off, In the case of widows and ascetics the entire Head vas to be shared. It was further provided by Parāśara (IX 52-54), Sankha (q. by Par. M. I. part I, pp. 290-291) that in the case of a king or prince or a learned brābmapa tonsure of the head should not be insisted upon, but that they should have to undergo double the usual penance and the dahsinā would have to be double, 239 The Mit, on Yāz. II. 325 quotes a verse of Manu 230 (not found in the printed text) 'tonsure of the head is not desired in the case of learned brāhmanas and kings except in the case of those guilty of mahāpātakas, of cow-killing of of being ad avahirnin'. The Mit. (on Yaj. III 264) further quotes Samyarta 251 to the effect that when the penance prescribed is only a quarter then only the hair on the body below the throat is to be shared, when half is prescribed then in addition the hair on the lips is to be cut, when three-fourths then all the bair on the body except the knot is to be cut and in the case of the full penance all hair including the šikna (the top-knot) also are to be cut off. The Par, M (II part 1. p 300) while describing cāndrāyada penance requires the cutting of the hair on all parts

I Vol. of the body (including private parts), 282 The tonsure is to be performed by a barber and yet the sanhalpa is 'vapanam karisye' and not 'vapanam kārayisye' From Gaut 27.3 (vapanam vratam caret) prescribing tonsure in cāndrāyana Haradatta and others infer that zapano is unnecessary in krcchra pedance 

Baths that are subsidiary to prāyascitta are performed with ashes, cowdung, clay, water, pañcagavya and water in which kusa grass has been dipped Mantras that are to be recited at the time of bath aro laid down in the Linga-piirāna, the Bhavisyapurāna and elsewhere, 

Thcra are certain virtues to be cultivated as being common to all prāyascittas whether secretly or openly undergone They are called vamas and niyamas and have been set out abovo (121) from Yāj III. 312-313 Atri (versos 48-49) sets them out somewhat differently. Manu IV, 204 (= Atri verse 47 ) refers to yamas and niyamas which Medhātithi explains as follows. viz yamas are in the nature of prohibitions (e. g. a biāhmada should not be killed), while niyamas consist of what is to be done (such as one Bhould always recite the Veda, as in Manu IV. 147). 

While undergoing prayascittas certain rules about food and other matters were to be observed. For example, Hārita 28 prescribes that the person undergoing penance should omit all days māsa and masüra pulse, honey, taking food at the house of or belonging to others and sexual intercourse, should not speak at an improper time, should perform ūcamana if he speaks with women or sūdras or those who are ucclusta Yama ordains that one who is undergoing a penance should omit massaging the body or head with oil, the chewing of tõmbula, applying unguents and every thing else that causes one to feel strength or sexual passion. 

According to the Pr 781 Prakāśa when undertaking & penance one should begin with the mantra * Agne vratapata

Prāgascittas are of two kinds, prakāśa (undergone openly ) and rahasya (undergone secretly). A few words must be said about the latter, Gaut. ( 241-11), Vas. (251-3), Manu XI. 248–265, Yāj. IIL, 301-303, Visnu Dh. S. 55 and other smrtis lay down rules about secret prāyaścittas, Where a man's 285 sin is not known to anyone except himself he may perform secret expia tion. In the case of adultery and in the case of association with one guilty of a grave sin, ono may still perform a secret penance, even though the adultery is known to the adulteress and even though the man guilty of & mahāpātaka is aware of the association, Vas.286 25 % states the general rule that secret penances are meant for those who have consecrated the Vedic fires, who are disciplined, old or learned and that the openly undergone penances are meant for others. If such & man is himself aware of the proper podance, he should perform it with out going to an assembly ( parşad ), but if he is not so aware he may consult some knowing pareon privately, asking him in a general way what the penance for a particular sin may be Vas, 25.3 provides that those who are always intent on prānāyāmas, holy texts, gifts, homas and japa are released from sin, Manu XI.226 states that those whose sins have not become public may be purified by homes and mantras. Even women and sūdras can perform penance in secret, since, though they cannot garform liomz and repeat Vedio mantras, they can, as the Mit on Yāj III.300 says, perform expiation by means of gifts and prānāyāmas. Gaut 26 % and Manu XI. 253 proscribe that one who desires to receive a gift which he should not accept or who receives such a gift should recite in water (navel-deep according to some) the hymn of four verses beginning with 'tarat

(246) prescribes that for the first ten days be should subsist on mık alone, on clarified butter for a further ten days, on water for another period of ten days, that he should partake of the articles specified only once in the worning, should wear wet clothes and should offer every day night symbolic homas with clarified butter, of his hair on the body, nails, skin, flesh, blood, muscles, bones and marron with the words 'I offer in the mouth of Death' added at the end, 257 Yā] II(301 prescribes that the murderer of a brāhmana should fast for ten days, should reoita the Aghamarsana hymn (R& X190) while submerged in water, donate a cow yielding milk, while Visou prescribes that he should bathe for a month in a flowing stream or river, should perform every day 16 prādāyāmas, should eat oply once a day sacrificial food and may then become purified. Visou provides that the drinker of surā becomes pure by observing the viata ( as stated) for brāhmana murder and reciting Aghamarsada; while the thief of brahmana's gold becomes pure by fasting for three days and reciting the sacred Gāyatri ten thousand times and one guilty of incest by the repeated recital of the hymn beginning with 'sahasrasīrsa' (Rg X. 90). 

The sages observed that some of the pedances mentioned in old sortis were terrible and inyolved loss of life Therefore, gradually more humane and easier penances came to be prescribed For example, Harita 28 states brāhmanas ho have studied dharmaśāstra should prescribe a pedance appro priate to the age, the time and the strength of the brāhmada (sidder), tha penance being such that he may not lose his life and yet may be purified; one should not presoribe an observance that will cause great distress ( to the sidder) Ažgiras also says that the par şad should indicate the penance resolved upon by all the menubers which would not cause loss of life Sankha

declares:2999. a brāhmana should never practise the parformance of a penance in a forest full of thieves, ferocious beasts, elephants and other animals through fear of injury to life. The body that is the all in all (i e. the only source ) of (the obsery ance of) dharma must be protected with efforts; just as water oozes down from the mountain, so dharm, springs from the body'. 

As times changed easier substitutes (called palyāmnayas) were found and prescribed The word pratyāmnaga was used in this sense in the Ap. Sr, S. V. 20,18 (yadyanadhyo-gnin ādadhīta kāmam-eyaikām gām dadyāt sā gavām pratyāmnāyo bhayatīti vijñāyate), 6 309 and San. Sr. S. 1451.6 and other sūtras Samayarta, 290 states that if a sinner is unable to undergo the Prājāpatya penance, he may donate instead a cow yielding milk and if he cannot donate such a cow he may donate the full price of such a cow, Parāšara 2942 (XI 63–64) provides four substitutes for a Prājāpatya, penanca viz the recital of the famous Gayatri mantra (Rg. II, 62 10) ten thousand times or 200 prādāyāmas, or bathing twelve times in a sacred watery place after drying the head on each bath, or taking to a journey of two yojanas towards a holy place. From the words of Gaut. 19 16 and 18 (quoted above in note 120) it follows that gold is a substitute for a cow by way of penance. The Brahmapurāpa 292 provides that in the absence of a cow a niska or half niska

or a quarter niska may be given The Caturvimšatimata 293 provides several pratyāmnāyas for Prājāpatya viz recital of Gāyatri ten thousand times, standing in water, gift of a cow to a brāhmana--these four (including Prājāpatya) are equal, as also a thousand homas with sesame, recitation of the whole sammulā of the veda, feeding twelve brahmanas, Pavakesti are equal. The Caturyimsatimata 294 stated that one should substitute the gift of one cow for Prājāpatya penance, of two cows for Santa pana, of three cows for Parāka, Tapta-krcohra and Ati krccbra and eight for Cāndrāyana The result was that from medieval times at least even in the case of mahāpātakas there was a sliding scale of penancos ultimately ending in feeding brābmapas or making monetary or other presents to them, Tor example, the Mit (on Yaj. III. 326) says that in the case 295 of the twelve years' penance, optionally 360 praja patyas could be performed, each prājāpatya extending over twelve days, that if a man was unable to undergo this he' should donate as many (ie 360) nilch cows, if that was impossible he may donate their price or 360 niskas or even half or quarter thereof &c. Yaj. III 309 provides (a lakh of) homas with sesame to the accompaniment of the Gayatri or making brahmanas recite the Veda by the gift of sesame. Vas 28 18-19 (=Atri VI. 7-8) and Visnu Dh S9010 state that by feeding seven or five brāhmadas on the Full moon of Vaišākha with sesame and honey a man becomes free of all sins. These prOVI

INI - Method of pratyānnõya 

129 

sions are maintained in almost all medieval works such as the Smrtyarthasāra pp. 149, 155, Prayascittasāra p. 203, Pr. T. pp. 517, 541, Pr. Mayükha p. 18 &c The same method is folloved in penances for lesser periods, It is due to this provi sion in the smrtis that in modern times men, when on death-bed, perform prāyaścittas for all their sins by donating a cow or mora or by monetary presents to priests.295& 

Some interesting sidelights ara thrown on the prices of milch cows, cows and bulls by the medieval writers The Pr, V. (p 199 ) states that the price of a milch cow (payasvini ) was 3 purānas, that of an ordinary cosy (go) one purāpa and that of a bull was five purāpas The Pr. T. (pp. 517–18 ) quotes Kātyāyana to the effect that the price of a cow (go) is 32 panas and that of a male calf one purana, that a pana is copper weighing 80 raklukūs or equal to 80 varütakas ( cowr ies), that 16 panas were equal to one purana (following Bhavisya and Matsya purāpas ), that by niska is not meant the one indicated by Manu (VIII, 137 ) but a dīnāraniska i, e gold weighing 32 raktıkās. The Prayascittendusekliara p. 7 follows Yāj I 365 and holds that niska is silver equal (in weight) to four sular nas or a pala, A. raktika weighs on an average 1.8 grains; so : copper papa of 80 raktikās vould veigh about 144 grains, Therefore a dhenu vas equal to 32 panas (or two purānas) i, e. about 26 tolus of copper (one tola being taken as equal to 180 grains). Vide H of Dh, vol. III pp.120-121 notes 161 and 162 . for information about ancient coins and their weights. There appears to be owing to lapse of centuries some difference in the views of several writers According to Vijñānešvara four surarnas are equal to a silver niska According to the Lilāvati 20 yarātakas are equal to a kākini, 4 kākinis are equal to a pada and a niska is equal to 256 papas, 

295a There was a parallel to this method of pratyāmnāja in Europe as rewashed by Gibbon A year of penance was appreciated at 26 solidt of silver, about four pounds sterliog, for the rich, at 3 solıdı or nine shilliags for the jodigeat; and these alms were soon appropriated to the Church which derived from the redemption of sias an inexhaustible source of opulence and dominion' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol VII. p. 187 (Smulk's ed, of 1862).

CHAPTER V NAMES OF ALL PRĀYAŚCITTAS 

Now all the prāyaścittas mentioned in the smrtis and digests will be arranged in alphabetical order (Sanskrit, transliterated into English), excepting mere hymns, fasts, &c. and brief explanations and references will be added to each. 

AGHAMARSANA-(The hymn Rg. X 190 1-3) 

This is prescribed as a penance for all sins by even the most ancient Dharmaśāstra works such as Gaut 24.11, Baud. Dh S IV. 2 19-20, Vas 268, Manu XI. 259-260, Yāj III 301, Vispu Dh S, 557, Sankha 18 1-2 and others. They prescribe that if a man recites (for three days, according to Haradatta) the Agharmarsada hymn thrice in the day while immersed in water for a bath, he is freed from all sins and that this pedance is equal in sanctification to the bath at the end of the Asyamedha sacrifice The Pr. Sāra p 199 speaks of the Aghamarsana vrata He has to fast for three days and stand up by day and sit up by night and donate a milch cow at the end. Sankha 18 1–2 and Visnu Dh. 8.46.19 prescribe the details. 

ATIKRCCHRA–Vide under Krcchra Manu XI, 213 prescribes that this penance is constituted by eating only one morsel of food for three days in the morning only, for three days in the evening only, for three days eating one morsel got without asking for it and observing a complete fast for the next three days Yāj II 319, on the other hand, prescribes the eating of just as much food as would fill the hand (and not merely one morsel) The Mit, Pr Sāra (p 176 ) and others state that the rule of Manu applies to those who are able to undergo it, while that of Yay is meant for those who are unable (asakta) The Sāmavidhāna Br. 1.2 6-7, Gaut 26,18-19, Vispu Dh S 54 30, Laugāksigrhya V.12-13, Parāśara X1,54-55, Vas 241-2, Baud Dh S IV 58 also spaak of this Manu 1.208 (= Vispu 54 30) prescribes this penance for striking & brahmana with a weapon or a cudgel Gaut 26 22 states that this penanca purifies a man of all sins except the malūpātahas 

ATISANTAPANA-See under Maha-sāntapana This is variously defined According to the Agnipurāna 171 10 and Visnu Dh S, 46 21 at lasts for 18 days (3 times of the Mahā-santapana in which for six days one has to subsist on cow's urine and five 

Atisāntapana penance

other things). The Mit on Yāj. II 315 quotes a verse of Yama according to which this penance lasts for 12 days. 296 The Pr. M. (p. 23) speaks of it as lasting for 15 days. 

ARDHAKĄCCHRA-See under Krochra. According to the Āpastamba-smrti 9 43-44, this is constituted by taking food only oncs in the day for one day, only once in the evening for one day, taking food for two days without asking for it and completely fasting for two days 207 (in all six days). The Mit. quotes another variety of it, viz, subsisting for three days on food obtained without asking for it and thereafter observing a complete fast for three days, 

AŠVAMEDHAVABHRTHASNANA- the ceremonial bath in the sea or a holy river at the end of an Aśvainedha sacrifics. Vispu Dh, S. 36 (last verse) prescribes for those guilty of mahāpātakas and apupātakas the Asyamedha sacrifice. It is only an emperor or a crowned king who is entitled to perform an Aśramedba, at the end of which comes a ceremonial bath. Vide H of Db, vol. II, pp. 1228-1236 for a description of the Aśvamedha According to Pr. V. p. 65 only a ksatriya could perform Aśramedha and so this bath was a penance for him alone. But according to Kullūka (on Manu XI. 92) and Pr. T.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. RSICANDRAYANA-According to Brhad-Visdu quoted by Pr, Prakarana p. 13% this penance requires that one should take only three mouthfuls of sacrificial food every day for a month 300 

ERABHAKTA-According to Pr Pr. (folio 488) If one takes for a month only one meal a day it is ekablaktaka.303 

KRCCHRA-This is the general word for several penances The Sāma. Br ( 2 1) starts 302 by saying 'we shall now expound three krcchras' and adds that one should eat sacrificial food for three days only by day add oat nothing at night, then for three days more one should eat at night only, then for three more days one should not beg or ask for food from others and should then observe a complete fast for three days If lie is in a hurry to purify himself he should pass the day standing and the night in a sitting posture. Gaut. (26.2–16) describes the procedure of the first Krcchra (called Prājāpatya by later writers), then Atikrochra (26 18-19), and then Krcchrātıkrcohra ( 26 20 ). Baud. Dh. S (II.1,91 ) speaks of Parāka as Krcchra. Āp. Dh S (19.27.7) describes the Krochra penance of twelve days. The Krochra penance described by Gaut, 26 2-16 is one for twelvo days and is called Prājāpatya by Manu (XI 211 ), Sankha (183), Yā) III 319 and others. Laugāksi Gr. (5 3-11) describes Krcchra According to the Par 303 M. (II Part 1 p. 30) and Pr, Pr, (fo)10 64a) the word Krcohra without any qualifying epithet (upapada) means Prājāpatya The Pr, T. (p 481 ) states that the Krcchra described by Gaut. (261-5) is given the name of Prājāpatya by Manu (X1. 211). Besides the rules about the intake of food, Gaut. prescribes certain other obsors ances viz speaking the truth, not holding conversation with

Br. 1 481) and the eight yerses beginning with 'Hiranyavarpāh' (in Tai, S V. 6.1), he should perform tarpina with water with 13 mantras (Gaut 26,12 ); he performs the worship of Aditya (the sun) with the same mantra (i.e, after tar pana vith the 13 mantras, he is to perform the worship of the sun with the same thirteen mantras ) and offers oblations of clarified butter with the same 13 mantras and then on the 13th day he cooks boiled rice and offers oblations into ordinary Agni ('svābā' added at the end of each, such as ' agnaye svaha), Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, Viśve devāh, Brahman, Prajāpati and Agni Svistakrt and then feeds the brābmanas. 

Krcobra-samvatsara-āp. Dh. S. I 9.27.8 spaaks of this as a penance in which Krcchras are undergone continuously in a cycle for one year. 

Krcchrātikrochra-Gaut, 26,20 and Sāma. Br. I. 2. 8, Vas, 24 3 define it as a krcchra where only water is drunk on those days on which food is allowed and Gaut. 26.23 and Sama. Br. 1 2 9 state that this penance freos a man from all sins, 305 Yaj. II, 320 ( = Dorala 86, first half) and Brabınapurāna g. by Pr, Pr. (folio 40 a) presoribe that in this one has to subsist on water alone for 21 days. This difference between the views of Yaj on the one hand and of Gaut, on the other is reconciled by the digests by saying that the pariod depends on the capacity of the sinner. According to Pr. Pr (folio 46b) and Aparārka p. 1238, Yama prescribed a krochrātikrcchra for 24 days, 306 Vide Par,

The Pr. Prakarana (p 15 ) states that for those unable to undergo Krcchra, one milch cow is a substitute, for Atikrochra two milch cows and for Krcchrātikrochra four. 

GOMūTRA-KRCCHRA-The Pr. Sāra p. 187 quotes a verse about this: one should make a cow eat to satiety grains of wheat mixed with barley and then may collect the yava" grains that are to be found in her dung and then drink the gruel of those yavas cooked in cow's urine. 307 

GOVRATA Pr, Prakarana (p. 132 ) quoting the Mārkandeya describes this as follows: One should bathe with cow's urine, should subsist on cow-dung, should always stand among cows, should sit down on cowdung, should drink water only when cows have drunk water; one should not eat when they have not eaten, should stand up when they stand, should sit down when they sit down. This should be continued for a month, 

CANDRAYAN 4-The word is derived in this way That rite, where there is action by means of inorease and decrease (10 the intake of food) in imitation of the courge of the phases of the moon, is cāndrāyana 308 The word occurs in Pān. V. 1. 72 (pārāyana-turāyana-cāndrāyanam vartayati) From very ancient times Cāndrāyana has been divided into two varioties, called Yavamadhya 309 (lit. being large in the middle like & grain of yava, and therefore tapering or thin at the ends) and Pipilikāmadhya (lit. baving a middle like that of an ant, that is, slender in the middle and large at the ends), Baud Dh S. II. 8. 33 names these two varieties. According to Jabāli 310 there are five

varieties of Cāndrāyana viz. Yavamadhya, Pipilikāmadhya, Yatıcāndrāyana, Sarvatomukha and stśucāndrāyana. These will be described later on. Yājñavalkya says (III. 326 ) that where no specific penance is prescribed in the smrti texts, cāndrāyana effects purification and cāndrāyana may be undergone not as a penance but for the purpose of accumu lating merit and that in the latter case (when performed for a year) the performer enjoys the happiness of going to the world of the moon after death. 311 Manu XL 221 and Gaut. 27.18 state the same view about cāndrāyana for accumulating merit. When the vrata of cāndrāyana is performed for the sake of merit, there is no tonsure (vide Gaut, 27.3 'vapanam vratan caret' and Haradatta thereon). Gaut. 19.20 (= Vas. 22. 20) prescribes that Krcchra, Atikrochra and Candrāyana are the same ponance for all sins ( collectively for grave sins, for lesser ones separately, according to Haradatta and others). Compare Manu V 21 and XI, 215 (=Baud. Dh S. IV.5, 16). Manu XI, 27, Ya]. ILL. 323, Vas, 27 21, Baud. Dh, S. IV.5.18 and others define Cāndrāyana (of the Yayamadhya type) as follows: On the first day of the bright half of a month only one morsel of food (grāsa or pinda) is taken, on the second irthi two and so on; on the full moon (Paurnamāsī) 15 morsels are taken; then on the first of the dark half 14 morsels, one being reduced on each succeeding day. So on the 14th of the dark half only one morsel is taten and on the Amāvāsyā there is a complete fast. Here in the middle of the month of thirty days the largest number of morsels is taken (and so this is Yayamadhya) just as on the Paurnamāsi day the moon becomes full and begins to wane from the next day. Here Paurnamāsi is in the middle of the period of the observance as Visnu Dh. S. 47.6 says. If one begins the vrata on the first toth, of the dark half, he reducas one morse) on the 1st i. e. takes 14 morsels on that day, 13 on the 2nd tithi of the dark half and so on On the 14th of the dark half he eats one morsel and on the amāvāsyā he eats nothing. Then on the 1st of the bright half he takes one morsel and goes on increasing the intake till on the Paurnamāst he takes 15 morsels The month is taken in this latter casa to be Pūrnimānta. Here in the middle of the observance there is no food taken and a large number of morsels is taken at the beginning and at the end So this is called Pipīlikāmadhya. This latter is dascribad by Vas 23.45

and Manu XI. 216. Vispu Dh, S. 47,5-6 say: Yasyāmamāvāsya madhye bhavati sa pipiliki-madhyah yasya paurnamāsi sa yavamadhyah. If there are 14 or 16 tithis in any particular paksa (half of a month ) thon the number of grūsas must be regulated accordingly There are other descriptions of cindrāyapa Vide Haradatta on Gaut. 27.12–15. The Kalpataru appears to have held (explaining two verses of Jābā]8) that on the first of the dark half of a month 15 morsels were taken, then one morsel less was taken on each succeeding tithi; so that on amāvāsyā one morse) was eaton, then on the first of the bright half two morsels were eaten and one morsel was added every day so that on the 14th of the bright half fifteen morsels were taken and there was a complete fast on Paurbamāsi. But this seems to be opposed to the very idea of increase and decrease of the intake of food on the analogy of the waxing and waning of the Moon and to several smrti texts such as Vas 23.45 and Parāsara X 2 Thorofore the Pr. Prakāśa (folio 58b) finds fault with it 31166 Cāndrāyana may be divided from another point of view into two varieties : (1) MUKHYA (in the primary sense, viz. following exactly the waxing and waning of the moon) and GAUNA (having a secondary or metaphorical senso). The former is either yavamadhya or pipillu-kanil madhya ), while the latter is of four kinds, viz. sāmānya, rsi cāndrāyana, śiśucāndrāyana and yaticandrayana The last two will be described later, The Samanya (or sarvatomukha ) consists in eating only 240 morsels of sacrificial food in a month of 30 days, distributing them according to one's choice (not necessarily in imitation of the phases of the moon) as stated by Manu XI 220, Baud. IV.5.21, Yāy III, 324 and the Mit (on Yā). II. 324), the Madana-pārijāta and other works. Here the penance, though it is not regulated by the phases of the moon, is called Candrāyana for the purpose of prescribing the same procedure and observances in it as in the Candrāyana which follows the phases of the inoon. Here the Mimānsā rule of Kundapāyinām-ayana applies. 322 From th 3 words of Gautama

27.12-15 it appears that he envisaged a cāndrāyana of 32 days ( pipllikamadhya ) or 31 days, when he says that the performer siould fast on the 14th of the bright half, eat fifteen morsels on the Full Moon day, then reduce it by one morsel, so that there is a total fast on the amārāsya and then on the first of the bright half one morsel is taken until on the full moon 15 morsels are taken. Thus from the 14th of the bright half (when fiere is a complete fast) to the full moon of the succeeding month there are in all 32 days and the penance is of the pipilikā-madhya type. 

As regards the size of the morsels, different views are Espressed. Gaat 27.10 and Vispu Dh, S. 47.2 prescribe that the size of a morsel shall be such as not to cause a distortion of the mouth (while swallowing it) Yaj TIL 323 allows that the morsels may be as large as the egg of a peahen, and Parāśara X,3313 prescribes the size of a hen's egg and Sankba that of an undried amalala fruit ( myrobalan). The Mit explains that Gautama's Fords apply to boys and young people and that the other sizes confer an option according to the capacity (sakti) of the man undergoing pedance. The procedure of candrāyana is described in Gaut, 27.2-11, Baud. III.8, Manu X1221-225, Vrddha-gautana chap. 16 and other works. The one given by Gautama, being pro bably the oldest among Dharmaśāstra works, is hera set out. 

The general rules prescribed for the Kyochra penance in Gaut. 266-11 are applicable to Candrāyada also. If it is parformed as a penance the performer must tongure his hair and observe a fast on the day preceding the Full Moon. He offers libations of water, oblations of clarified butter, consecrates the sacrificial food and worships the moon, reciting 'āpyāyasva!, (Rg I 91.17), 'san te payāmsi' (Rg. I 91. 18). He shall offer clarified butter, reciting the four (rks) beginning with 'yad dara devahedanem' (Vaj. S. 20.14 or Tai. Br. I. 6.6.1). These

four together with the preceding are seren oblations of clarified butter that have to be offered. At the end of the offering of clarified butter he shall offer pieces of sacred fuel while reciting the (eight) texts beginning rith 'derabrtasya' (Vāj S VII 13). Each mouthfuj must be consecrated by (mentalls ) reciting one of the 314 following words 'om bhūḥ, bhurah, syah, tapah iruth, fame, prosperity, rigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, lyrightness, soul, dharma and sira' 315; or he may consecrate all of them at once saying 'adoration' stāhā'. The sacrificial food must be one of the folloring. boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley, grain separated from the husk, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, sour milk, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. Among these each succeeding one is preferable to that edumerated earlier.

IV 5.10, Sankle-smrti 18.4, Agniparāda 171 6-7, Atri verses 122–123, Parāsara IV. 7 speak of it as of 12 days' duration comprising four periods of three days each In this one drinks hot rater, hot milk, hot ghee for three days each and then for three days there is a complete fast rhen he inhales hot Tapour or atmosphere (ace to Bladu XI. 214) Manu adds that the performer has to bathe only once (and not thrice as in some other penances) and that he should practise self-control Tāj II 317 (= Devala 84) speaks of this as of four days' duration, viz he takes hot milk, hot ghee and hot Tater for one day each and observes a total fast on the 4th day.

The penance Tæptakrochra 

of by the Mit has to be found out The Pr. Prakāśa refers to a tapta-krochra for 21 days. It may be said, as done by the Pr. Prakāša, that the penance of tapta-krochra for twelve days is meant for great sins and that the one for four days is meant for lesser sins The quantity of water, mišk and ghee, that was to be taken is laid down by Parāśara 316 IV. 8, Atri 123-124 and Brahmapurāna (q. by Pr V. p. 513) viz. that hot water, hot milk and hot ghee should be six palas, three palas and one pala respectively The Brahmapurāna adds that water, milk and ghee are to be taken respectively in the evening, morning and noon 

TULĀPURUSA KRCCHRA-Jābāli speaks 317 of the duration of this penance as eight days; Sankha (18,9-10) and Visnu Dh. S. 46 22 describe one of ten days where oil-cake, the foamy scum of cooked rice, butter-milk, water and barley meal are to be sater, each respectively ou one day, followed by a fast on the next day Yā). III, 32% (= Atri versos 129-130) describes one of 15 days where the above five ingredients are eaten for three days each. Yama on the other hand speaks of Tulāpurusa for 21 days, when the five things are separately saten for three days (vide Mit, on Yāj II. 322). Aparārka pp. 1239—1241, Par. M II. part % pp 184-189, Madanapārijāta pp. 718–727, Pr. Sāra pp 179–181 set out at length the mode of the performance of Tulāpurusa as a penance. In this penance two images of the parformer made of fragrant usira grass were to be prepared and placed in the pan of a balance a span high made either of gold or silver or sandalwood and were to be weighed against pebbles and placed in another pan and worship was to be offered to Mahadeva and Umā and many other subordinate deities sucli as Agni, Vāyu, the sun.

TOYA-K.RCCHRA-This is also called Varuna-krochra by Yama (q in Pr. Prakāśa, folio 48 a) and by Sankha (q in Pr. Sāra p. 182). Visnu Dh S. (46. 14) states 318 that subsisting on nothing but ground barley mixed with water for one month is called Udakaktcchu a. Since Varupa was regarded as the lord of waters even from the times of the Rgveda (e. g. in Rg. VII. 49. 3) and to mark the truth and falsehood among men, this Toya krochra was called Varuna. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 47 b)319 quotes Jābāla to the effect 'If a sinner remains immersed in water for a whole day and night without taking food and recites mantras (addressed to Varupa) he removes by the jalalcrcchra the sing which he may have committed for a year'. According to Yājña valkya (q in Pr. Sara p 187) this penance consists in observing a fast for a day and night standing up the whole day and passing the night without sleep in water and reciting the next day the sacred Gāyatri mantra 1008 times. According to Sankha (g. by Madana-pārijāta p 737) this penance is constituted either by subsisting on lotus stalks giown in water or on saktus boiled in water. 

DADHIKROCHRA-This is spoken of by the Pr Prakasa quoting from the Visnudharmottarapurāna as a pedance in which the sinner subsists on ourds alone for a month.320

Penance called Devahrcchira of only rice gruel, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee each for a period of three days in succession and then should observe a complete fast for three days; this is called Devaksta (performed by the gods) penance and destroys all sins. It was practised by the Maruts, the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. By the power of this ponance they became free from rajas (impurity). Thus this penance lasts for 21 days. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 48 b) refers to apother variety of it and quotes a long prose passage on it, which is passed over here for pant of space. 

DHANADAKRCCHRA-See under Vayayya-krochra. According to the Visaudharmottara 322 (q. by Pi. Prakāśa) this penance consists in subsisting for a month on food just sufficient to fill the extended but hollowed palm, mixed with gold (i. e, in which gold is rubbed or boiled). 

NITYOPAVASA KROCHRA-The Pr. Prakāśa (p. 48 a) states that this is constituted by a man eating only twice in the day (in the morning and evening ) for six years and not drink ing even water between the two meals. 323 

PANCAGAVYA -For the various details connected with panicagavya prepared from cow's urine, dung, milk, cards and ghee, vide H, of Dh, vol. II, pp. 773-774, Pancagavya is to be offered into fire with the mantras 'Irāyati' (Rg. VI, 99,3), 'idami Visnur' (Rg 1.22. 17), 'mā nastoke' (Rg. I. 114.8), "Sam po deyir' (Rg. X 9.4) and then the remainder is to be drunk. It is to be drunk with the middle of a sprig of three Palāśa leaves or with a lotus leaf. Manu, XI, 165 ( = Agnipurāna 169, 30) prescribes this drinking of pañcagavya as the penance for petty thefts Similarly, Yāj. II. 263 prescribes that one guilty of killing a cow should drink panicagavya for a month. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 263 quotes Visnu to the effect that one who kills a cow should perform one of three penances, yiz, drinking three palas of pañcagavya every day for one month or undergoing the penance of Parāka or Candrāyana, 324 Though Vispu 54, 4 and Atri (verse 300 ) state that a brālimapa

PARAKA-Manu XI, 215 (= Baud. Dh S IV. 5.16), Yāj. III. 320 (= Sankha 18 5 = Atri 128), Agnipurāva 171, 10, Visnu Dh, S. 46. 18 and Br. 325 prescribe that this penance is constituted by not taking any food for twelve days, while the performer controls his senses and remains vigilant, and that this penance removes all sins. 

PARNAKŪRCA-This is a more severe type of patra krcchra Yā) II 316 (= Devala 83) and Sankha-Likbita 326 define Parnakrochra as one where the leaves of palāša, udumbara, lotus, and bilva are boiled separately on each day in succession and the decoction of each is drunk on each day separately and then water in which kušas have been dipped is drunk. Thus parpakrcchra is a penance of five days The Mit. on Yāj. III. 316 quotes a verse of Yama to the effect that when a sinner fasts for three days and nights and thereafter he drinks together the decoctions of all the four and Icusa water on the same day then the penance is called parnakūrca. The Par M (II part 2 p 181)327 regards Parnakūrca as a variety of Parna krcolira Vasistha, Jābāli and Atri (116–117) make Parna kicchra a penance of six days by adding the leaves of Aśvattha to the five mentioned above, Visnu Dh S 46 23 mentions another variety of Parpakrcchra for seven days 328

PADAKRCCERA-According to Yaj. III. 318(=Dovala 85) this is defined as a penance where a sinner takes food one day only once by day, only once by night, then once only by day or night) but without asking for it from any one (a stranger, a servant or even his own wife) and observes a total fast for one day. Thus this penance lasts for four days. There was differ ence of view as to the number of mouthfuls to be eaten, Apastamba (a by Mit, on Yāj, II, 318) saying that the mouth fuls are respectively 22, 26 and 24 when food is taken only once in the evening or morning or without asking for it, while Parāśara states the number of mouthfuls to be 12, 15 or 24 respectively when food is taken only at night or in the morning or without asking for it The Caturvimsatimata (q. by Par. M. II part 2 p. 172) puts them as 12, 15 and 10 respectively 

PADONAKRCCHRA-This lasts for nine days 329 only instead of the 12 days of the Prājāpatya and in it one eats by day only for three days, eats food once only for taree days with out asking for it from any one and observes a complete fast for three days (i. e, three days when food is eaten by night only are omitted here). 

PUSPARRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāna 171. 12 and the Mit, on Yāj II. 316 (quoting Markandeyapurāna) this penance is constituted by drinking for a month the decoction of flowers boiled in water. 330

Some passages from Baud who is probably the oldest of the three authors may be set out here, 331 "Now if a man feels his conscience heavy with bad actions committed by himself, let him boil for himself, when the stars have risen, a liandful of barley and prepare gruel with that. Let him not perform (the Vaisvadeva) offering with (a part of) that nor a Balh 332 offering. Let him consecrate the barley before it has been placed on fire, when it is being boiled and after it has been boiled with the following mantras 'thou art barley, the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varuna and mixed with honey, the sages have declared thee to be an expeller of all sins and a means of purification' Then there are five verses more invoking the barley grains to purify the performer from all sins whether due to deeds, words, or thoughts, to destroy distress and evil fortune, to free him from the food of ganas (guilds or multitudes of men), hariots, Sudras, or food offered at sraddhas by persons in impurity due to birth or death, food of a thief, food at navaśrāddha (i e on 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th days after death) or from dreadful mortal sins or from guilt against children and guilt due to serving in a royal court, from sin of stealing gold, sin of the violation of a viata or sacrificing for an unworthy person and sin of speaking 1]] of brāhmanas Then Baud proceeds "while the barley is being boiled he should guard it and recite 'Adoration to Rudra, lord of created beings; pacified

Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul reciting 'ye deva' (Tai. 

S. 1. 2. 3. 1)." 

Then Baud. prescribes: "one desirous of wisdom must perform this rite for three days and nights A sinner who drinks it during six days becomes pure, he who drinks this during seven days becomes purified from the wahāpātakas, he who driuks during eleven days removes even the sins conmitted by his ancestors. But he wybo during 21 days drinks gruel of barley grains which have passed through a cow (i. e. cowdung) sees the Ganas, the lord of the Ganas, the goddess of learning and the lord of learning." 

PRAJAPATYA-Vide under Krochra above where it is shown that the word Krcchra without any qualifying epithet means Prājāpatya. Manu XI. 211, Yaj III, 319, Visnu Dh. S. 46 10, Atri 119–120, Sankha 18 3, Baud Dh. S. IV 5 6 mention the word Prājāpatya and define it. This Prājāpatya bas several 'varieties. The first is that described by Manu XI, 211 and Vas, 21, 20 viz. four periods of three days each following one another in which there is respectively eating once only by day, once only by night, eating once only without asking for it and complete fast. The second is that described by Vas. 23. 43, where on the first day food is taken only by day, on the 2nd only at night, on the 3rd day food got without asking for it is taken and on the 4th a complete fast is observed and where the same process is repeated for two periods of four days each The first 333 is called Prājāpatya by 'sthānaviyrddhi' and the 2nd is called 'Dandakalita'. Further, both these are said to be made ānulomyeza' (by the proper and straightforward order). If the sequence described above is reversed i, e if for three days there is first a total fast, then subsisting for 3 days on food got without asking for it, then for three days eating at night only

One should feed cows on plenty of yavas anointed with clarified butter Then he should mix water with the dung of those cows and take out the grains of barley which are voided by thein after eating them He should then dry them in the sun, should grind them on a clean stone and cook them mixed with sesame and anointed with ghee in cow's urine on a fire brought on an altar He should place the boiled holy grains in a vessel of gold or in a cup made of palāśa leaves and present them to the gods and manes and he may eat them. He should carry this on for twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six years for the removal of all sins. This is prescribed as a penance for killing one's guirre, brother, friend or a near relative &c.

[Vol. VAYAYYA-KRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāna 318 and Vispudharmottara this penance consists in subsisting for a month every day on food that will just fill the extended palm. 

VRDDHAKRCCHRA-VRDDHI-KROCHRA-This is a penance for eight days, according to Sankha-Likhita 349 and Yama, in which one takes food only by day for two days, only by night for two days, without asking for food for two days and fasts for two days 

VYASAKRCCHRA-This 18 the same as Maitra krochra, 350 for which see above p 148. 

ŠISUK RCCHRAalso called Balakrcchra by Sankha Likhita and Pādakrcchra by Devala and Prāyasoittamuktāyalı (folio 10 a) and is the same as Laghu-krcohra 35! It lasts for four days, eating once only in the day, eating once only by night, eating food got without asking for it only once op one day and fast on one day. Vide Vas 23,43 (a by Haradatta on Gaut, 26.5), Baud Dh. S II 1.92, Ya. III. 318 

ŠISU-CANDRĀVANA-Manu XI, 219, Baud Dh. S IV., 519, Agnipurāna 171.5 state that when a brāhmana eats (for a month) four mouthfuls in the morning and four after sun-set, that is Siśu-cāndrāyana (cāndrāyana for boys, old men &c). 

$īTAKRCCHRA–This is the reverse of Taptakrochra, as hera all the articles are to be taken when they are cold 3510 and not hot (as in Tapta-krcchra). Vide Vispu Dh S 46 12, Agoi purāna 171 1 and Mit on Yā). III, 317 According to Visnu quoted by Pr Sāra (p. 185) and Madana-pārijāts (p. 736) this is a penance for 10 days (and not for twelve days as the Mit. states), viz cold water, cold milk and cold ghee are drunk three days each and there is a total fast for one day

SANTAPANA-Vide Mahāsāntapana and Atisāntapana above It is of five kinds, viz the first for two days, the 2nd for seven days, the third for twelve (Atisantapana), the 4th for 15 days and the fifth for 21 days, 

SURACĀNDRAYANA-The Agnipurāna defines it as one where somehow or other (and not in a rising or falling scale) a man partakes of 240 morsels of food in a month. Yā). III, 324 speaks of it as a variety of Cāndrāyana. Visnu. Dh S. (47 9) calls it'sāmānyacāndrāyana' 353

For killing a brāhmada secretly or for the guilt of incest one had to perform ten thousand or 40 thousand suvarda-krochras and a lesser number for various other lapses. 

SOMAYANA–According to the Madanapārijāta pp. 744 746 (quoting Hārītadharmasūtra and Mārkandeya) and Pr Prakasa (folio 60b) the penance lasts for thirty days divided into five periods of 7,7,7,6, 3 days, in which the milk of all the four udders of a cow, of three udders, of two udders and of one udder is respectively drunk and for the last three days there is a complete fast. There is another variety which lasts for 24 days from the 4th tithi of the dark half of a month to the 12th of the bright lialf of the next foit-night, the 21 days 213 divided into eight periods of three days each; in the first four

II part 2 p 183 and others) makes it a penance of four days' duration, in the first three of which one partakes successively of oilcake, saktus and butter-milk and observes & fast on the 4th day. Atri (128-129) also mentions it. The Pr. Prakāśa (quoting Brahmapurāda) speaks 354 of another variety of six days' duration, on the first of which there is a complete fast and on the last of which the sinner subsists on saktus alone and in the intervening four days he subsists on the thick gruel of barley cooked in cow's urine.

CONSEQUENCES OF NOT UNDERGOING PENANCES 

If a sinner did not undergo a prāyaścitta, the Smrtis, Purānas, medieval digests declared that he had to suffer diro and far-Teaching consequences Yā). IL, 221 declares that men addicted to sins, vho feel no repentance and who (therefore ) do not undergo the proper penances, fall into painful and horri ble bells Manu XI, 54 ff and Yā). IIL 206 ff Provide that those guilty of grave (and other) sins after having passed numbers of years in hells and suffered the tortures of borrible hells are born again in this world because of (the remnants of their) svil actions in different forms such as lower animals, insects, trees and shrubs &c Manu XI. 53 ordains that one should always perform penance in order to free oneself from sins, since those who have not destroyed their sins (by means of prayascittas) are born again endowed with disgraceful marks (such as having bad nails, black teeth &c.). Manu XI. 48 also emphasizes that vickad men suffer mal-formations owing to their wicked deeds committed in this very life or in a former life. The Vişnu purāda 365 echoes the words of Ya]. III, 221, The Visnudharmo ttara declares 356 that those (sinners) who do not undergo penances nor are punished by the king fal} into hell and are born also as lower animals and even after attaining human bodies they become marked (with bodily defects). Visnu Dh. S. (44. 1-10) prescribes 357 that evil-doers, baving experienced the horrors of hell pass into animal bodies and that those guilty of atipātakas, mahāpātakas, anupātakas, upapātakas, Jāti

bhramsa-kara actions, sankarikarana, apatrikarana, malini karana and miscellaneous sins, respectively enter the bodies of all plants, of worms (or insects), of birds, of aquatic animals, of animals roving in waters, of deer, of cattle, of untouchables among men, of miscellaneous and cruel carnivorous animais (like tigers). Visou Dh. S. 45.1 provides 358 that sinners, after having undergone the horrors of hells and after having passed through the bodies of lower animals, are born as human beings with certain marks (indicative of their sins) So the teaching of these and other authorities comes to this that sins when not expiated by penances or by State punishment, lead to hell, that then, owing to some remnants of the evil deeds, to birth as lorer animals and then as decrepit or diseased human beings. 

It 18 now necessary at this stage to enter upon a historical though brief account of the idea of Hell and of its opposite Heaven 359 There are in the Roveda hardly any clear or express references to Hell In Rg II. 29,6 the sage prays to the Vissa Davas 'save me from the pit, from falling down into it' (trādhram kartād-avapado yajatrāh), In Rg IV 5 5 16 is said 360 that those men who are bereft of tta and satya, being sinful, create deep place for themselves. In Rg. VII 104.3 the poet calls upon Indra and Soma to strike down 361 into bottomless darkness evil-doers, and in VII 104,11 the poet prays that whatever enemy desires to harm the poet by day or night may be deprived of his body and progeny and may be hurled below the tbreg earths Indra is implored in Rg X. 152.4 by the sage to send down into darkness whoever attacks him and his people. In Rs. IX, 73 8 Soma is said to throw dosyn in a pit those who do not observe Soma's ordinances and who are disliked by hiin. Irom these passages what emerges is that the sages of the RgTBON had some faint glimmerings of (or belief in) the idea of a dark

Idea of Hell in Vedic Literature deep pit bolow the earth to which wicked persons were relegated by the gods But there is no mention in the Rgveda of the tortures of Hell. It is in the Atharvaveda that we find the clearest references to Hell (Naraka). Sorcerers and demons dwell in a house below (the eartb), according to A, V.II, 14, 3. Atharva Feda V.30 11 asks a man to come out from death, from the deep and black darkness. In Atharvayeda 362 V. 19. 3 it is asserted that those who spat in the face of a brābmana or who imposed a levy of money on him remain biting hair in the midst of a river of blood Atharvaveda XU. 4. 36 mentions "Nāraka-loka'. In the Vāj. S, XXX, 5 the Vialan 363 (i, e, one who gives up or extinguishes the consecrated Vedic fires) is relegated to nāraha (nārakāya virabapam). A vir alan may also mean 'one who kills a valiant man' but that does not seem to be a proper sepse in this passage of the Vaj S. In the Sat, Br. XI. 6, 1 4 we fud a reference to torments of Hell, viz. men cutting up the limbs of others one by one for crimes committed The Tai. À I. 19 speaks of four narakas called Visarpin, Avisarpin, Visādin and Avisādin in the south-east, south-west, north west and north-east, Trom the Kathopanisad it appears that at that time there was a belief that those foolisi men who do not know the Reality and who only believe in the existence of the mundane world alone have to be born again and again and fall into the hands of Yama 364 (II. 5-6) The same Upanisad (V. 7) states that aiter the death (of the body) somo enter the womb in accordance with their actions and knowledge to have an embodied existence, while others go into fixed matter (the form of trees and the like). But that Upanisad says nothing about the torments of Hell. They were therefore probably not believed to exist in those days, at least, to the sapie degree as in the days of the Epics and Purības. The very words at the beginning of the Katha Up, (I. 21 'devair-atrāpi vicikitsitau') indicate that there were even then various views about the fate of the departed The Kausitaki Br (XI 3) propounds the remarkable proposition that

just as men in this world eat the (flesh of) beasts, so in the next world the beasts eat mon 365 

As regards the opposite idea of svai ga (Heaven) the matter is much clearer In certain Rk verses there are said to be three heavens (eg Rg I 35 6, VIL 5 8, VIII, 41 9, IX. 113. 9) The generous donor or worshipper is said to occupy heaven and to mix among gods; and gods like Mitra and Varupa are implored to give the worshipper immortality 366 (Rg I, 123, 5, V. 63. 2, X 107 2 ) Life in heaven is full of joys and de lights and the denizen of heaven has aļl his desires fulfilled (Rg. IX. 113 10–11 ).367 In Rg IX, 113 8 the poet prays 'make me immortal (in heaven) where dwells king Vaivasvata, where the sun is confined (i e. where it never sets) and where the divine waters flow' A. person who neither offers sacrifices to gods, nor worships, and observes ordinances other than those of Indra is thrown down from Heaven 36 A sage exultingly addresses Soma 'we have drunk soma, we have become immor tal, we have reached Light (Heaven) and we have known the gods; what will an enemy or harnıful person do to us who have been mortals so far?' 369 The pious dead become united in Heaven with their Istāpūs ta (merit due to sacrifices and chari table acts) and with their fore-fathers and become ondowed with a refulgent body (Rg X 148). Those who practise tapas or those who perform sacrifices in which the fees run to thousands (of cows) reach Heaven (Rg x 154.1-3)3, and Soma, ghee and honey flow for them there. Heaven is said to be the abode of Yama and there resounds the sound of flutes and of songs 371 The Atharvaveda, being more popular in

Idea of Heaven in the Veda character, contains much more information about Hoaven. In Atharvayeda III, 29,3 it is said that a donor goes to Heaven where a weak man has not to render to the strong any contri bution 312 In Atharvaveda IV. 34.2, 5-6 it is stated that in the heavenly world there are bovies of women (for the denizens), that there the dwellers get many edible plants and flowers and that there are ponds of gliee, streams of milk and honny, vina 

In flows like water and lotus lakes surround the denizens. Heaven the meritorious enjoy delight, their bodies being free from disease 373. Atharvaveda VI. 1.20.3 and other verses ex press a yearning to meet one's parents, wife and sons (vide Atharva XIL 3,17).374 The Tai. S. is full of references to Heaven and so no quotation is cited bere except one where it is said that he who offers the Adābhya cup in Jyotistoma goes to heaven while still living in this world.375 The Tai, Br. appears to hold that those who offer sacrifices bacome shining stars in the firmament (I. 5. 2. 5–6)375a The Sat. Br. (XI 1. 8.6) states that sacrificer who offers a sacrifice as this redemption is born in the next world (Heaven) with his body entire '. 375 Survival of the soul after death is emphatically asserted in the Tai. Br, III. 10. 11. These passages are enough to establish that the state of the pious after death and of heroes killed in battle was one of happiness in heaven, that there the food and material things (such as honey, ghee) that a person required in this world were also available in greater perfection and abun dance The remark of Macdonell 'Heaven is a glorified world of material joys as pictured by the imagination not of warriors but of priests (Vedic Mythology p. 168) is not (in view of Rg.

that the warriors of Vedic times did not believe what the priests believed. Iu later tiines (as in the Bhagavadgitā II 37 'hato vā prāpsyasi svargam' or in the Ragluvamśa VII. 51 ) warriors killed in battle were supposed to go to heaven and were privi leged to have the company of beautiful damsels Heaven as a place or state of eternal bliss to which the spirits of the reli gious or meritorious people or warriors go, is an idea common to most ancient peoples and was probably based on the idea that the Earth was flat and the sky was a dome carrying various celestial objects In the Brhadaranyaka Up (IV 3 33) and Tai Up. (II, 8) it is 377 stated that the joys of the world of gods are lundreds of times more delightful than those of the morta] world 378 In the Kathopanisad (I 12 ) it is stated by Yama hin self that in Heaven there is no sear and no old age, that the denizen of Heaven is beyond hunger, thirst and sorrow and is in the midst of all delights. The Kausītakı Br Up as quoted by Sankarācārya on Vedāntasūtra 1128 contains the statement that the abode of sinners is below this world or 379 the earth. The Cliāndogya Up in one place remarks380 'those whose con duct has been good will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a brāhunapa or a ksatriya or vaiśya But those whose conduct has been evil will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog or a log or a candāla'. 

We have here a complicated blending of two theories The original theory of early Vedic times was that of Heaven and Hell which is also that of most religions Later on when the docti i nes of harma and punar Janma came to be universally believed in India the theory of Heaven and Hell came to be modified by holding that the pleasures of heaven and the torments of Hell both came to an end some time or other and the author of sins was born again as an animal or a tree or a human being suffer ing from diseases and defects

159 Yama in the Veda The fate of the departed soul after the death of the body will be touched upon in the section on Antyesti and Sraddha, but in connection with the doctrine of Hell it is necessary to say something about Yama. In Rg. X. 58, 1 Yama is called Vaivasvata (son of Vivasvat, the Sun). Yama is at least an Indo-Iranian deity. Yama is eulogised in Rg. X. 14. He is 

of gathering called a king and is credited with the task together people (X. 14. 1); le is said to have been the first to make a way to Heaven) which was followed by former ancestors of mankind (X 14,2 'Yamo no gātum prathamo viveda. yatra nah pūrve pitarah parayuh '). The soul when departing from this world is told that when he follows the paths of the ancient ancestors he would see the two kings Yama and Varupa. In Rg. X. 14. 13-15 the priests are asked to press Soma for Yama, to offer oblations to him and it is said that yaiña reaches Yama, Agni being the messenger. In Rg. X. 135. 1 Yama is stated to drink in the company of gods, he is the lord of men. Yama owns two dogs each having four eyes who guard the way, who are the spies of Yama and who move among men and mark their doings. In Rg. X. 97. 16 the sage prays 'May the plants release me from the effects of the) violation of oaths, from the violation of the ordinances of Varupa, from the fetters which Yama claps on the feet of sinners and from all sins against the gods "331 In Rg. X. 165. 4 Yama is identified with Mrtyu (death) and the owl (an evil omen) or a kapota is said to be the dita (harbinger) of Yana Rg 1. 38 5 (addressed to the Maruts) appears to crave for something which is opposed to that other references to Yama state 'May not the singer of your praises go by the path of Yama"382 Thus, though in the Rgveda, Yama is a god and mostly a beneficent ruler of men, there is an element of fear associated with him as the two prying dogs that guard the way to heaven and his being called Mrtyu would suggest. The Atharvaveda refers to Yama in several places in the same strain as in the Rg. In A, V 18 3 13 it is said 393 'serve the king Yama with offering, who was the first to die among men, who was the first to depart from this world and who, the son of Vivasyat, is the gatherer of men', In Tai S. V. I. 8% and V 2.3.1 it is stated that Yama is the lord of all mortals and of

When a sacrificer strews Oşadhiss on the Vedi it is indeed tantamount to taking up a debt from Yama If he (the sacrificer) were to go from this Torld without burning them they (Yama's men) might take him to the next world with fetters round his neck' In Rg & 14, 10385 the pits are said to enjoy delights in the company of Yama In the Ait Br 385.7 (XII. 3) Mrtyu is credited with having fetters (pāsas) and wooden maces (sthānu) for catching erring men It has already been seen how Yama is said to have within his powers again and again foolish men who believe in the existence of this Torld alone and deny the existence of the next Thus, from being a beneficent ruler of the departed souls in the very early Vedic times, Yama came gradually to be looked upon as a dreadful punisher of men 335 The Puradas contain graphic descriptions of Yama's abode and of his assistants, chief among whom is Citragupta For example, the Varāhapurāda 356 chap 205 con tains a dialogue between Yama and Citragupta, in which the latter recommends the fate that a dead person desettes for his actions The Agnipurāpa chap. 371. 12 states that a sinner falls into horrible hells that are declared by Citragupta at the order of Yama,

IV Heaven and Hell in post-Vedic Literature 161 

We must now turn to the ideas of Heaven and Hell contained in the post-Vedic Literature, sūtras, smrtis, puradas and digests. The Nir. (I 11 ) quotes387 a quarter of & Vedic verse which means 'for fear that if we (women) acted crookedly towards our husbands ) we might fall into Hell' The word Naraka is derived by it in two ways (172 to araka), viz. as meaning 'going below' (the earth) or (na to ra t-ka) where there is not the slightest place for joy'. In another place, while deriving the word 'putra' (son) the Nir. (IL 11) declares that the son is called putra because he saves (the father) from the hell called put. The same derivation of the word putra is offered by Manu IX 138 (=Adiparva 229.14 Visnudharmasūtra 15.44). Gautama (13,7) promises 388 heaven to the witnesses in a cause if they speak the truth, but Hell (naraka) if they tell the opposite (of truth). After defining patana as loss of the capacity to perform the privileged acts of twicz-bors classes (such as Veda study &c) and stating that by being guilty of sios a man does not in the next world reap the fruits of his good actions, Gautama states the striking viey of other sages that naraka is nothing more than this loss of capacity and of the fruits of good acts, his own view how ever being that naraka is a particular place where a man has to dwell solely in distress and sorrow. It was the enphatic view of Gautama that men of the several varnas and aśramas that ara devoted to the actions prescribed as peculiar to each, enjoy after departing from this body, the fruits of their actions and then oving to some remainder of their total actions are born in bodies in appropriate circumstancas as to the country, caste, family, appearance, length of life, learning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence, while those who act contrariwise

Dh S, affirms that Naraka is indeed one's lot when one trans gresses one's dharma. It also states that rewards without end are denominated svai gya. The Vedāntasūtra II 1.13 makos it 391 clear that after enjoying the fruits of one's actions in the abode of Yama (Samyamana) ovil-doers ascend to this mortal world.

The Vignupurāna I, 6.41 names seven hells, Tāmisra, Andhatā misra, Mahāraurava, Rauraya, Asipatrayana, Kālasūtra and Ayici and (in IT, 6 2-5) names 26 narakas, Sankha-Likhita as quoted by the Madanapārijāta pp 694-695 mentions in detail the torments that evil-doers undergo in the he]ls called Kum bhīpāka, Raurava, Mahāraurava &c.

The names are almost the same in all these works, the variations being due mostly to the scribes having read certain letters differently. The 21 names are generally significant and may be set out from Manu as follows: Tāmisra (darkness), Andhatāmisra (blinding darkness), Mahāraurava, Raurava (abounding in paths with heated surfaces, according to Pr. V. p. 15), Kālasūtra (like the thread on the wheel with which the potter outs off a ray earthen pot in two), Mahānaraka, Sanjivana (where one is made to revive and is again killed), Mabāvici (where one is submerged in surging waves), Tapana (as burning hot as fire), Sampratāpana (same as Kumbhipāka, according to Pr.

[Vol. 

V. 6,2-5, Skandapurāna I, chap. 39 and VL 226-227, In the Mārkandeyapurāna ( chap 12) we have a description of several Darakas like the Rauraya, Mahāraurava, Asipatrarana &c and chap 14 (verses 39-94) mentions the punishments moted out to perpetrators of various sins In the Mahabharata also narakas and the torments thereof are frequently referred to For example, Sāntiparva 321 32 speaks of Vaitaradt and Asipatravana, Anušāsana ( 23 60-82) speaks of the actions that lead to hells(each yerse having the refrain te var noraya-gāmnah) Anušāsana 145.10-13. Svargārohanika-parva (2 16-26) describes the several horrible sights and torments of such hells as * Asipatravana' (named in verse 23 ) and Kütaśālmalı (named in Svargarohanika 34). The Vrddha-Hārita-smrti (IX. 167-171) mentions almost the same 21 narakas as the Manusmrti does. The craza for multiplying Darakas went so far that the Brahmapurāps, the Visoudharmottara 395, the Garuda-purāna and others declared that there were thousands, lakhs and crores of narakas, 

The Visnu Dh, S. (46, 23-29) provides that those guilty of atipātakas, anupatakas, sankarīkarana, who have not under gone prāyaścıttas suffer respectively for one Kalpa,395a for one Manyantara, for four Yugas, for a thousand years in the 21 Darakas in rotation and the other sinners for many years. Yama quoted by the Madanapārijāta p. 696 says that those guilty of Mahāpātakas stay in Hell with face downyards for a yuga and Yama has numerous other verses stating what sinners undergo which horrors of Hell. 

Buddhists appear to bave borrowed the doctrine about hells from Brahmanical writers Vide Dr B O. Law's mono graph on 'Heaven and Hell in Buddhist perspective' (1925), pages 111-113. which refer to eight Mahānisayas and there are other - Jesse Hells. The eight Mahānirayas are Saājīva, Kālasutta, Sanghāta, Roruva, Mahāroruya, Tapa, Mahātapa and Avici. It will be noticed how those names agree closely with Manu's 1156

E. vol. 45 pp. 279-286 ). Similarly, for the ideas of Heaven and Hell in Zoroastrianism, vide Mr. S. N Kanga's 'Heaven and Hell and their location in Zoroastrianism and in the Vedas' (1933).

There are very gloving descriptions of Heaven ( svarga) in the Mahabharata, the Purānas and other works. We bave already seen how Heaven was supposed to be a place of delights in the Rgveda and even in the Upanisads like Katha (I. 12-13 and 18 

sobātigo modate syargaloke'). Rg. X. 107.2 affirms that those vho give (large) daksnā stand bigb in the Heavens ( as stars), those that donate horses go in the company of the Sun and those that donate gold become immortal. An3% echo of this is found in Vanaparya 186,9. The Kaus Up 13 speaks of several worlds (lokas) of the gods such as those of Agni, Vāgu, Varuda, Āditya, Indra, Prajāpati, Brahmā and a similar gradation of higher worlds is described in Br. Up. III.6 (such as Devaloka, Indraloka, Prajāpatiloka, Brahmaloka) The Br. Up. 1.5. 16 speaks of manusyaloka, pitrioka and devaloka and holds that deraloka is the best of all worlds 311 Eans, Up. 1. 4 implies that in the heavenly world divine nymphs, garlands, collyrium, fragrant powder, garments wait upon the fortunate depizons. Sankara on Vedānta-sūtra (IV. 34) says that the word 'loka' means "a place for enjoying the fruits of one's actions 

(bhogāyatana) and that Hirapy agarbha is the adhyaksa of Bralmaloku (on Vedānta-sūtra IV. 3 10 ) In the Vanaparva (54, 17-19) it is stated that svarga is the place for those who die in battle How starga is like and what the pleasures of heaven ara is described in Vanaparva, chap. 186.6-7, viz, that there are extensive lakes full of golden lotus flowers and fish and devoid of mud, that on the banks of those lakes dwell the meritorious honoured by Apsarases who apply fragrant cosmetics to their

bodies, wear ornaments and have brilliant golden complexions. Similar pleasures enjoyed in the Nandana park are promised in 

Brahmapurāna, 225.5-6. Vanaparra (chap. 261 verses 28-29) says that there is one great draw-back in going to hearen,riz, that there one simply enjoys the rewards of one's good actions, no new merit is accumulated there, one simply subsists on the accumu. lated principal or store of merit and that when that store is exhausted one has to fall down, the only good point about this being that one is born a man and that too in such a way that he enjoys398 happiness, Apušāsana (23. 84–102) sets out numerous actions whereby a man attains heaven (each Terse having the refrain 'te narāh svarga-gāminah') Similarly, in Brahmapurada 224. 9-14, 18-25 and 30-37 we have the same refrain. Vide also Anušāsana chapters 144 (verses 5-15, 19-26, 31-39) and 145 Santi (99. 4-5) states that syarga is full of those fallen in battle, there are Gandharva damsels there for the brave (and there is bell for the coward) and that svarga Fields all desiras that one may entertain. The Santiparta (192.8 and 21 ) states that syarga was in the North, that (Sānti 191 19,193 27) there vas neither hunger nor thirst nor weariness nor old age nor sin (in Heaven), that good men (Santi 271, 24) are seen as stars (or become stars). In the Matsyapurāpa (276 17) it is 399 stated that he who performs Brahmāndadāns (one of the 16 malādānas) reaches the world of Vişou and delights in the company of Apsarases. The Brahmapurāna (225. 6-7) assures us that a generous donor goes to beaven where he enjoys the best pleasures in the company of Apsarases and in the beatedly garden called Nandana and when he falls down from heaven he is born as a portal in a rich and noble family. Vide a]so Garudapurāns IL 3.86-89. It is not necessary to multiply passages. There are two matters to be noted in connection with Heaven and its pleasures, One is the calculating or bargaining spirit which the smrtis and purānas display viz. make this or that gift and then there is so much delight to be enjoyed in heaven, a sort of profit and loss account; and the second is that the highest

Lamitations on pleasures of Heaven 

pleasures of Heaven have a time limit, i, e. they are to come to an end one day and the meritorious have to be born again in mortal bodies. The doctrine was gradually evolved that there is no final release from the cycle of births and deaths by the performance of meritorious deeds alone 

It is not necessary to set out at length the gruesome torments of Hell described in great detail in several smrtis and purānas. By way of a sample, the following description taken from a Dharmaśāstra work (viz. Visnu Dh, S. 43.32-45) will be quite enough. "Sinners guilty of having committed (one or more of the nine kinds of) sins have to endure terrible sufferings when they have left this life and reached the path of Yama. Being dragged hither and thither by the fierce servants of Yama they are led (to hell) by them with frightening gestures, (In Hell) they are devoured by dogs, jackals, crows, herons, cranes and other birds eating raw flesh, by snakes and scorpions that haya fire in their mouths (i. e. that emit stinging poison). They are scorched by fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts by saws and oppressed by thirst. They are afflicted with hunger and by terrible hordes of tigers and they faint away at every step on account of the stinking smell of pus and blood, Desiring to secure the food and drink of others they are beaten by the servants (of Yama) whose faces are similar to those of such horrible animals as Crows, berons and cranes. In some places they are boiled in oil, in others they are pounded with pestles or ground down in iron or stone vessels. In some places they * (have to eat what is vomitted or pus or blood or excrements, and hideous meat smelling like pus. In one place they have to stay in terrible darkness, and are devoured by horrible worms having flames in their mouths. In some places they are over whelmed by cold or have to pass through the midst of unclean things and in other places the departed devour each other, thus becoming most horrible, In some places they are beaten on account of their former deeds and are suspended in other places (from trees &c.) or are struck with heaps of arrows or are cut into pieces. In other places they have to tread upon thorns and they are encircled by the hoods of serpents, they are tor mented with machines and are dragged by their knees. Their backs, heads and neoks are fractured, they become terrible (to look at ), their throats being reduced to the size fit for a care shelter and they become unabje to bear torments. Sinners are being tormented in this way and having suffered intopse

pain undergo various further sufferings in their passage through animal bodies ( in which they are thereafter born )" 

That naraka is a place below the earth is frequently stated in the Purādas For example, in the Garuda and Brahmānda purānas all Hells such as Raurava are stated to be situated below the earth. Vide Vispupurāna II 6.1 also. The Bhāga vatapurāna states that Hells are below the earth and above water to the south of the three worlds and hang without support, in which dwell the troups of pitrs called Agnisvõtta and others. 400 The Agnipurāna (371 13-14) avers that the 28 groups of narakas are below the earth and even below the 7th Patala 

We come across Vedic passages such as these 'This sacri ficer who is possessed of the utensils of yara directly reaches Heaven' (Sat. Br. XII 5 2 8 ) 401, one who desires Heaven should offer the Darsapūrpamāsa sacrifice', 'one desirous of attaining heaven should perform the Jyotistoma sacrifice What is meant by svar ga or naraka has given rise to hot discus sions from very ancient times The popular view as reflected even in the Vedas, the smrtis and purānas was that syarga yas a place above the earth and naraka was a place of actual torments below the earth Even ancient astronomical works located svarga thousands of yojanas above the earth. Parāśara, 40% an astronomer and a predecessor of Varāha-mihira quoted by Utpala on Br.

nountain Meru, 84000 yojanas high and sixteen below and hrice as much in length and width, which is called syarg&, But it would be far from the truth to say that all eminent yriters were agreed on the actual existence of svarga and laraka as places. It has already been shown how several jenturies before Christ Gautama refers to the view of some predecessors of his that naraka is not a place, but simply means he loss of the capacity to perform the peculiar actions of one's vai na There were others who argued in the same strain, Jabara (on Jai IV. 3. 27-28) quotes a Vedic passage where the view of the sage appears to be that sacrifices yield the reward promised by śruti in the next life and where Kumātila. 403 in his brief comment propounds the view that the injunctive passage (vidhi) of the Veda only promises a reward but does not state that it follows immediately in this life, that syarga which means unsurpassed joy, can happen only in another life, On Jaimini VI. 1. 1. Sabara first puts forward the prima facie view that svarga 404 imports in popular language such things (dravya) as fine silken clothes, sandalwood paste, young damsels only 16 years old and that the word svarga is also popularly applied to a particular place where there is neither heat por cold, neither hunger nor thirst, neither distress nor fatigue and where only those that have done meritorious deeds can reach and not others. Sabara refutes this view and holds that the primary meaning of the sword svarga is joy 905 or delight and not a thing (dravya) which brings joy. 

There is a well-known and oft quoted verse which defines suar ga as follows: 406 that happiness which is not mixed up with

pain, which is not immediately afterwards overwhelmed (by pain) and which is present whenever desired, is denoted by the word svah (or svarga). The Prakarana-pancikā of Salika nātba, 400x one of the early works of the Prabhākara Mimānsā sohool, affirms that in such sentences as 'one desirous of heaven should perform the Jyotistoma' the rite is simply commended by Vedic passages, which are no more than arthavādas, as a means of securing long-enduring happiness which is free from the taint of all kinds of sorrow and which is present at the mere desire of the enjoyer. The Sāntiparva expressly states "The wise do not regard the other world as directly seen by anyone; one has to entertain faith (in the existence of the other world) because otherwise one may run counter to the Vedas.' 407 The Bralımapurāpa and the Visnupurāda speak in the same strain as Sabara that svarga is what causes bappiness to the mind, that narake is the opposite of it and that meritorious deeds and wicked deeds are designated as svarga and naraka respectively and that syarga and naraka are really states of the mind characterised by happiness and pain respectively.108 ! One need not wonder at the crude ideas of naraka and svai ga entertained by most ancient Indian writers and works. The same ideas were pravalent among peoples of all religions a]] the world over. For example, The Egyptians whose dynastic history covers a period of about 5000 years had very remarkable beliefs about Heaven and Hell which were illustrated with pictorical representations copiously (as no other nation had ever done), although the oldest Books of the Dead are without illustrations of any sort (vide E. A. W, Budge's 'Egyptian Heaven and Hell', 1905 p. XI and 2). Sheo] was the name the Hebrews gave to the gloony abode of the dead in the lowest parts of the earth and it was a land of darkness, which was appointed as the house for all living (Job 10, 21-22 and 30. 23) The Greek Hades closely resembles the Hebrew Sheol in its chief characteristics. In the New Testament also Hell is & land of everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and it is a place where the wicked go into everlasting torment " 406 , ज्योतिष्टोमेन स्वर्गकामो यजेतेत्येवमादिसमाम्नायं सकलदु खसम्भेदरहिताभिला. giaditing and rṛ để hī tại Thất (P 102 ). . .407. न हपूर्व प्रत्यक्ष परलोक विदुर्बुधा । आगमास्त्वनतिक्रम्य श्रद्धातव्य बुभूषता। 3 28 42. - A08. mostrar man hargcafqI 7

and punishment, while the righteous attain life eternal (Matthew 25. 41 and 46, Luke 16.23). The words of the New Testament are plain enough that Heaven was supposed to be a place above the earth and the clouds and that Hell was a place below the earth full of darkness and torments. Vide Luke 23. 43, Ephesians I 3 and 20, II. Cor. 12, 4, Rev.2.17; and Luke 12.5 and 16.23; II. Peter 2.4 and Rev. 68, 20. 13-14, Bloomfield in his 'Religion of the Veda' p. 257 remarks 'In later Hindu times Hell is filled out with the usual gruesome stage-setting in the style of Dante's Inferno or the wall paint ing in the campo santo at Pisa'. Even men of genius like Shakespeare and most Christian theologians 409 down even to modern times believed in a literal interpretation of passages from the Bible which speak of Heaven and Hell as places. It is only recently that many Christians have begun to hold that the language of the Bible about Heaven and Hell is purely symbolical in character 410. 

409. Vide William James in "Varieties of religious experience' p. 264, where he says that the fear of the old-fashioned Hell fire was employed by Christianity to extract from it fruits for repentance and conversion value and Pringle-Pattisol in 'Idea of Immortality pp. 15-19, Vide for the Quranic ideas of Hell, SBE. vol IX p. 317 'Hell is a reward for the out rageous to tarry therein for ages. They shall not taste therein cool por drink but only boiling water and pus', Vide also SBE. vol. VI P 247 (Hell contains seven divisions), vol. VI p. 165 (for the misbeliever is the torment of hell Gre), vol. XIV p. 317 and p. 340 (for boiling water, pus and fire). In the Quran Heaven was supposed to consist of seven divisions viz Garden of Eternity, Abode of peace, Abode of rest, Garden of Eden, Garden of Resort, Garden of pleasure, the Garden of the most High, the Garden of Paradise,

The Report on the 'Doctrine of the Church of England' pablished in 1938 by a Commission consisting of some of the highest digartaries of the English Church makes interestiag reading, though to a noa-christian the language appears rather full of circumlocation and far from clear and defnite, Da p. 206 the Report states **The drama of the Last Things as set forth in the medieval 'Doom' pictures rests on a tradition which makes use of a more or less literal conception of heaven and kell as specific 'places', of which a picture was formed by drawag upon traditional material, more especially the imagery of the Book of Revelation, which is itself largely drawn from Jewish and other pre-christiao sources... ....A qaasi-literal interpretation of the imagery has in fact generally prevailed among Christians and bas been wide-spread eves in educated circles almost down to the present day.'

The Sacrtis had evolved the doctrine, as stated above, that if & sinner did not undergo prāyaścitta, he had to suffer tora ments in hell, thereafter he became born as some insect or lower animal or a tree on account of some remnants of his sins and that he was born as a human being afflicted with certain diseases or vith defects. 411 These last two consequences are described under the title karmavipaka (the fruition of evil deeds). Šātātapa (I. 1-5) asserts that men guilty of grave 

(Continued from the last page) self soppression at an earlier time, it is fellowship with God who is love ... This 18 infinite bliss to the soul which is purged of self-joterest. Heaven is also a fellowship of fioite spirits " It will be patent how modern European miads have begun to thiok of Heaven and Hell in terms analogous to those in which some of the best minds of India thought of them centuries before and After the Christian era la spite of the glowiog pictures of the pleasures of Heaven and terrifying descriptions of the torments of Hell detailed in many of the sacred and popular works in Sanskrit and other Indian languages people have gone on committing all sorts of sins. The ancient machinery of Heavens and Hells must be deemed to bave largely failed of its purpose 10 these days. Large masses of men appear to be slipping into an abyss of despair, misery, bardness of heart, wapton brutality and lawlessness The lurid accounts of bombings and pight raids on big cities, the reports of the bloody battles for six years 10 the World War No 2, the harrowing tales of tortures in such prisoners' camps as at Belsen, the phenomenal rise in the prices of all necessities of life (food, clothing and shelter), frequent stribes and struggles between the employed and the industrialists, growing indisciplipe, arson, plonder and bestial treatment of human beings on the ground of race or religion have produced bardness of bears and debased large masses of Indian people. It is a very difficult question for our leaders how to revive among the common people of India, (wbom Westerners dubbed muld Hindus) the old characteristics of tolerance, peacefulness, goodwill and respect for human life and property, how to build up a new fabric of society, a new civilization and culture on the ancient Upadisadıc foundations of the parsnit of Reality, brotherhood of man, the unity of all life, and love of mankind even without pressing into service the ancient and medieval literal conceptions of Heaven and Hell,

ins that have not undergone prāyaścitta are, after undergoing ihe torments of Hell, born with bodies marked with certain zondemned signs. One guilty of grave sins bears şuch signs For seven births, one guilty of upapātaloc for five births and one Quilty of pāpz for three births. These marks indicative of their baving committed a particular sin are observed in each 

ife and only disappear after they repent and perform prāya 'citta. Similarly, the diseases arising from sinful deeds sub side by adopting the remedies of the recitation of Vedic jexts, vorship of gods, homas and gifts,' Verses 6-10 specify the diseases that arise in consequence of sing such as leprosy, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, dysentery, kidney trouble, stone in the bladder, cough, fistula &c. A man may commit sins of three kinds viz. by the body, in words and mentally (Manu XII. 3). Really speaking, it is the mind that is the spring of all actions (Manu XII 4), but for the sake of convenience, this threefold division is made. Coveting another's wealth by unfair means, desiring that evil should befall another and persistence in false ideas (such as the one that there is no soul, but that the body is the soul)-these three are mental sins (Manu XII. 5). Harshness of speech, falsehood, backbiting and irrelevant prattling those four are vocal sins (ibid XII, 6). Appropriating to onese]f another's wealth without his consent, injury to sentient beings against the injunctions of sastra, sexual intercourse with another's wife--these three are bodily sins (ibid. XI. 7). Manu provides that bodily sins reduce a man to the state of a fixed object (tree &c.), vocal sins reduce bym to the state of birds and beasts and mental sins to the lowest castes (Capdāla and the like). Harita (q. by Par, M )412 speaks of 18 evil actions that lead to hell, of which six are mental, four vocal and the rest are bodily sins. Manu XII. 54-59 and 62-68, Yaj. III 131, 135 136, 207-208 and 213-215, Vispu Dh, S: Chap. 44, Atri Chap, 45-14, 17-44 (in prose) state into what animals, trees and creep ors sinners are born after undergoing hell torments. The state monts of Yāj being concise are set out here. This soul enters into hundreds of bodies in this saṁsāra, viz, as one of the lowest castes, bird or fixed object (tree &c) on account of his lapses spring ing from the mind, speech and body (Ya).

TIT 207-208). On stealing leafy vegetables one is born as a peacock, on stealing perfumes one is born a chuchundari (musk-rat), the thief of corn, of a vehicle, fruits, water, milk, domestic utensils (like pestle), honey, flesh, a cow, fire, cloth, juice (of sugarcane or the like) and salt is born respectively as a mouse, a camel, a monkey, a playa (duck), a crow, a sparrow, bee, vulture, godkā (iguana), orane, a man suffering from wlijte leprosy, a dog, cii (cricket bird). The Brahmapurana (chap 217 verses 37–310) contains a long dis quisition on the different kinds of animal births that sinners of various kinds have to undergo Vide also Garudapurāna (Protakhanda) 2 60-88, Agni 371 30-32 (which latter states that the murderer of a brāhmada is born as a beast or deer or a dog, bog, or camel, the drinker of wine as an ass or pukkasa or mleccha, the thief of gold as a worm or pest or moth, one guilty of incest as grass or a bush). 

It was believed in yery ancient times that diseases were the consequences of sins413 In the Atharyaveda VIII. 7.3 plants are said to have destroyed from each limb the disease due to sin:14. Manu XI. 49-52, Vas. 2044, YāII. 209-211, Visnu Dh. S Chap 45, śātātapa I. 3-11 and II, 1, 30, 32, 47, Gautama. smrti in verze chap 20 and Gautama (in prose g by the Mit on Yā).

p. 861), Yama (g by Pr. M. 09), Sankha (q. by the Mitaksarā on Yaj. III. 216 ), Smrtyarthasāra pp. 99-100 state the diseases and bodily defects from which sinners suffer after they are born as men. As a sample Yāj. III. 209-211 may be cited here; the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from Tuberculosis, a drinker of surā has black teeth, the thief of brāhmana's gold has diseased nails, one guilty of incest suffers from leprosy; the thjef of food suffers from dyspepsia, one who stealthily learns without permission (or one guilty of plagiarism) is born dumb, one who mixes up inferior corn with superior corn is born with excessive limbs (with six fingers &c.), a backbiter is born with pus in the nose; a thief of oil is born as tilapāyī and one who falsely reports faults in others has a foetid breath. Yāj. III. 217 states that after reaping the consequences of their (evil) deeds (by falling into Hell and) by reaching the state of lower animals, sinners are born as human beings of a low order, poor and with con demned marks on the body; even medical works like the Carakasambita held the belief that diseases were the con sequences of actions done in past lives (vide Sūtrasthāna, Chap. I 116), 

. The smrtis are not in complete agreement about the diseases or bodily defects that sinners of various grades suffer. For example, though Vas 20 44 and Sankha (q by Mit, on Yaj. ITI, 216 ) state that the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from leprosy, Manu XI. 49, Yāj III, 209, Visnu Dh. S 45. 3, Agni, 371, 32 aver that he suffers from phthisis. For want of space the long lists of the births as lower animals and the diseases and deformities from which sinnors suffer contained in Sankha, Hārsta, Gautama, Yama and the Purāpas quoted by the Mit.. on Yāj IL 216, the Par M. I. part 2 pp. 230-240, 242-272, Madanapārijāta pp 701-702, the Mahārnava-karnavipaka are passed over here, 

Āp. Dh. S (II. 1. 2. 6-7) states that a brāhmana, ksatriya or vaiśya sinner guilty of brāhmana murder, after undergoing the tornients of Hell is born again respectively as a Candāla, Paulkasa and Vaida and that other sinners who have become outcasts by their sins are born on account of these as certain animals (like pigs) Similarly, Manu XIL 61 provides that one who from greed steals precious stones, pearls, corals and jewels of various kinds is born as a goldsmith.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

Although the word Karman is ordinarily employed to denote good as well as evil actions still in the section on pen ances the word 'Karman' prominently presents to the mind the idea of evil deeds. Hence Karmavipāka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasūtrā:15 I 13, viz jātı (birth as a worn or animal &c), āyuh (life i. e living for a short period such as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell &c) The vord Karmavipaka appears to have been known to Yā). III 131 (vipakaḥ karmanām pretya kesām cid-iha jāyate) and it occurs frequently in the Purānas (e g in Brahma-purapa 224 41, 225 43 and 59, Matsya 115 14 &c). The Pr, Sāra pp. 219-231 contains probably the longest treatment of Karna vipaka The doctrine of Karmavipāka was well known to the Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna, who in his Ratnāvali refers to it416 The Buddhist Avadānašatakas also refer to the doctrine of Karmavipāka. Vide also Suttanipāta (S B. E vol 10 part 2) p. 38 and S B. E vol 21 p. 130 (Saddharma-pundarika ). In some medical works also such as the Haritasamhita it is said that the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from white Jeprosy and the killer of a cow from black leprosy ; a regicide suffers from phthisis, and the destroyer of a park frum dysentery &c.417. In the Vivāgasuyam (Vipākaśrutam), which is the 11th anga of the Jaina-āgama and an edition of which was brought out by Dr. P L Vaidya (in 1933) we have stories of persons who suffered from evil diseases ovving to their committing evil deeds in former lives and other stories of the fruits of good deeds.

ence in Heaven and Hell the consequences of their deeds. The Vişavdharmottara explicitly states so$19. 

The Mit, on Yaj. IL 216), the Smṛtyarthasāra, Par. Mi, Pr. Sāra and other works state that the disquisition on Karmavipāka420 is merely an arthavuda, that it is not to be taken literally, but is meant to induce sinners to updergo such prāyaścittas as Prājāpatya which entail great worry and trouble and which no one might willingly undertake, The Mit points out that the description of the diseases (like pthisis) is not intended for requiring those who suffer from " them to undergo the penances for twelve years or the like nor for induc ing people to avoid contact with such persons, that ģistas do not avoid contact with those who have bad nails, that in the case of soch persons the disease or defect is the last result of wbat little sin remained attached to them and that by the very fact of their having the disease or defect mentioned in the texts they become free from the last remnants of their sins and therefore they do -Dot stand in need of any further panance and as their sin is -finally removed by suffering the disease or defect their fitness 

for being allowed to mix among people is established 

The teaching of the works on Karmavipaka, though dismai 80d terrifying, comes to this that no soul Reed be without hope provided it is prepared to wait and undergo torments for its mis deeds, that it need not be appelled by the numerous existences foreshadowed in those works and that the soul may in its long passage and evolution be ultimately able to discover its true greatness and realize eternal peace and perfection. 

Manu XII. 69 (almost the same as Vispu Dh, S. 44.45 and Garudapurāna II 2. 89) states that women guilty of the sin of theft become the wives of men who are guilty of the same offences.

Varāhapurana (chap. 203 21 ff ) expatiates at length upon the topic how sinners endure torments in Hell for innumerable years, how after their evil deeds have been almost wiped out they become human beings suffering from various diseases or deformities. i In the Mahārnaya-karmavipāka of Mandhātr it is stated that there are two means of destroying the consequences of (evil). actions, viz krochira (penances) and the reversal (or remedies) against diseases $21. The latter consists in making golden images of the sun (as the superintending deity of good health ) and of the deity of a disease and offering worship to both these in a mandapa on a raised vedıkā (plat form). The work expatiates at length on the Vedic verses employed according to Asyalāyana and the Taittiriya Sākhā for ghosa-sūntt (propitiatory ceremonies with loud recitation of Vedic mantras); the worship of the sun with Vedic mantras and of the planets, the offerings of ahutus, the Rudraikādasini, Mahārudra (11 times as many as the preceding) and Ati rudra, repeating the thousand names of Vispu, Vināyaka šānti (as laid down by Yāj. I. 271-294), Navagraha-yajña in which it assigns each planet to some country and some gotra *22. It also prescribes how for the removal of particular diseases particular dānas may be given (such as Kadalidāna i e. manufacturing a kadalı plant from one pala of gold and donat ing it). It deals with the gifts of the images of all diseases supposed to be incurable and quotes Śātātapa II. 47-48 in con nection with the removal of rājayaksmā (phthisis). It deals at length with fevers and other diseases and bodily defects such as greenish or cat-like eyes, deafness &c. But the detai led treatment of all these matters is passed over here from considerations of space, and also for the reason that these prescriptions are now either hardly believed in by people or hardly ever performed.

CHAPTER VII 

ESCHATOLOGY 

What happens after death to a human being (which is the subject matter of Eschatology) has been a great mystery that has intrigued and baffled mankind in all ages and was a question of vital importance among almost all ancient peoples such as the Indians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians. The Ford Eschatology is derived from a Greek term meaning 'last things and is applied to the study of opinions that men have held from time to time concerning the future, including such matters as the state of man after life on this earth and the end of the world. It exercises a great fascination over most people and speculation on it can be carried on endlessly. Every religion has its own eschatology. There are two aspects of Escha tology; one is concerned with the destiny of the individual after death, immortality of the soul, sin and punishment, the meaning and content of 'Heaven' and 'Hell'; the other aspect of eschatology has relation to the whole universe, its creation, destination and renovation, and the ultimate end of all things. The first aspect and matters relevant to it from the ancient Indian point of viow will be dealt with in this section and the second aspect of Eschatology is reserved for treatment in a later section. In ancient works far more emphasis was laid on the first than on the second, while modern men with a more or Jess scientific outlook and attitude are inclined to think more of the second aspect. 

Death has been generally looked upon with feelings of awe and terror, though there were men (often philosophically minded) who looked upon it as a blessing and as a release of the spirit from the shackles imposed upon the latter by the body. The terror of death was in many cases due not so much to the pain

(Vol. 

caused at the time of death but rather to the mystery that sur rounds what happens after death and to the thoughts about what the survivors would have to undergo. It is said by O E. Vulliamy in his work 'Inmortal man' (p. 2): ‘although the idea of that life (ghostly life) ranges from the most disma) and horri ble fantasies to the most sublime imaginations, the fundamental thought is always the same, the body dies but not the spirit'. There were several attitudes adopted by primitive as well as ojvilized people towards death. In the Kathopanisad we road (I. 1.20 ) When a man dies there is a doubt, some saying that there is survival after the death of the body and some denying any survival' and Naciketas requests the dreaded God Yama to solve this doubt. There are several beliefg421a ayon among those who hold that there is survival after death. Some say that there is a world of the dead to which whatever survives goes after death Others believe that the surviving part goes to Heaven or Hell according as the man has been virtuous or sinfu) in his life on earth. Others believe in transmigration and re-incarnation, Several of the great writers in anoient Greece believed in this last doctrine, as Pindar (in second Olympian Ode), Plato (in Phaedrus and Timaeus) and Herodotus (II. 123) indicate. 

The Brahmapurana (chap. 214 verses 34–39) sets out the Persons to whom death is happy and easy and not a source of misory and sorrow. A few may be mentioned hera.-'He who did not tell lies, he who did not prove false to affection or friendship, who is an āstıka (a believer in God and the life to come), who is devoted to the worship of gods and the honouring of brāhmanas, ha who does not bear malice to anyone-these have a happy death,' Similarly, the Anusāsanaparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 104. 11-12, chap. 144 49-60) states at Jength the causes of prema ture death and of long life. Some of them may be translated here. Those who are atheists, do not perform the acts (or sacrifices) proper for them, violate the (diotates of) elders and of sāstras, who do not know what dharma is and are evil-doors are short-lived. Those who have no character, who always braak all rules of conduct, who have promiscuous sexual inter Course become short-lived and go to Hell. One who is not irritable by tempor, speaks the truth, does not cause injury to baings, who bears no malice to any one and who is not crooked—those live for a hundred years' (104. 11-12 and 14).

Signs of Approaching Death Several works specify the signs indicative of the approach of death. The Santiparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 318. 9-17), Dayala quoted in the Moksakānda of the Kalpataru (pp. 248-250, about 20 verges), the Vāyupurāna (chap. 19 verses 1~32), the Mārkandeyapurāna 43. 1-33 (chap. 40 verses 1-33, Venkatesvara Press ed.), Lingapurāna (pārvārdha chap. 91) and other Purāpas contain long lists of the signs of appr02 ching death. It is impossible for want of space to set out in detail these signs. But the gist of a few verses is mentioned by way of sample. The Sāntiparva (chap 318) states that a dian who is not able to see the star of Arundhati which he could for morly see, nor the pole-star nor the full moon, nor his own reflec tion in another man's eye has only one year to live; he has only a span of six months of life left to him who sees the orb of the moon with a hole in it; a man has only seven days left of life who sees a bole pierced in the orb of the Sun, who smells the odour of a corpse when fragrant substances are near; when the nose and ears bend down, when his teeth and eyes become discoloured, when there is loss of consciousness, and loss of bodily heat, when smoke emerges from the crown of the head, when the left eye begins to ooze moisture all of a sudden these are indications of the immediate approach of death. Davala states indications that prognosticate life for only one year, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 months, one month, half a month, 12 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days and winds up by saying that one who cannot hear the humming sound in his ear (when closed with fingers) or cannot see the light in the eye is going to die immediately. The Vāyupurana (19.28) and Lingapurāda 91.30 regard the last two as the worst indications of approaching death 433. The Lingapurāna (pūrvabhāga chap. 91.%t) states that he who cannot see his own reflection in another's eye will not live. There is an interesting paper by Dr R.G. Harshe in the Munshi Diamond Jubilee volume (pp. 246-268) where the learned writer gives the text of two moss, on the prognostications derived from dreams e. g. if a man sees an ass in a dream he is sure to die, or if he sees an old maid then it is an indication of danger, disease and death (p. 251) or if he sees a trident death is indicated (p. 254).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

I Vol. When a man is sinking and is almost on the point of death it was and even now is the practice in many parts of India to take the dying man down from the bedstead and place him on & bed spread on the earth424 For example, the Kausika-sūtra (803) prescribes 925 : When the man is losing all strength, he (the son or other attending relative) spreads Tušas on the grass growing in the shed and takes him down (from the bed-stead) with the manira 'syonāsmai bhava' (mayst thou be good to this man, Oh Earth). The Baud P S III 1 18 says that sand should be spread on the ground in the sacrificial shed when it is feared that the sacrificer is dying and darbha grass should be strewn on the sand with the sharp ends turned to the south and the dying man should be placed thereon and one (son or the like) should repeat in his right ear the anuvāka beginning with ayusah prānam santanu'. The Gobhilasmrti III. 2% and later works lika the Pitrdayita provide the same procedure. 

Medieval digests like the Suddhiprakāśa (pp 151–152) stata that when a person is moribund, has half closed his eyes and is taken down on the ground (from a bed-stead), his son or other relative should make him giya one or more of ten gifts viz of cows, 426 land, segame, gold, clarified butter, clothes, grain, jaggery, silver, salt These gifts are superior even to a śrāddha performed at Gayā or to oven hundreds of Ašvamedhas.

sankalpa (verbal declaration of the gift) is made in the words 'I shall make ten gifts for the attainment of heaven (abhyudaya), or for the removal of all sins'. After the ten danas, a cow with & calf should be donated if possible 427 (this cow being called utkrānta-dhenu "a cow donated in view of death') and then another cow called Vaitaraps with gold (or two pieces of cloth &c) should be donated. The Antyestipaddhati and the Suddhi prakāśa (pp. 152-153) set out all the mantras (not vodic) that are to be recited at the time of making the several gifts, which (nantras) are passed over here for want of space. The Antyesti paddhati, the Antyabarmadīpaka and other works prescribe that when a person is near death, his son or other relative should make him perform Vratodyāpana, sarvaprayascitta and the gift of ten danas or if the dying man is unable to do these himself, the son or the other relative should perform these and give the merit thereof to the dying man. A person often resolyes upon observing certain vratas, but fails to carry out all the details of those yratas to the end. The Vratodyāpana for the dying man is meant to cure all such unfinished yratas, The A. K.D. (pp. 3-4) has a long note about the performance of vratodyāpana. Briefly it comes to this. The son or other rolativa having brought about the purity of the dying man's body by a bath or by sprinkling it with holy water (mārjana) or by making him drink Ganges water, having himself taken a bath and perform ed his daily duties (of sandhyā). having lighted a lamp, having bowed to Ganeša and prayed to god Vispu, having placed before him the materials of worship and having repeated the usual sankalpa ( see note 128), he should honour a brāhmapa

May there be the attain mont of the fruits of udyāpana (accomplishment of vrata )". In the sarvaprāyascitta the son approaches 4 or 3.learned men or one man knowing adhyātma (metaphysics) and offers the substitutes (of gold &o.) for sins that involve penances for 6,3 or 14 years or makes a declaration and performs the prayas citta, after the days of impurity. 

The sarvaprāyaścitta was to be performed by the dying man or by bis son or other relative who was to shavs himself, take a bath, drink paltcagarya, honour a brahmana with sandal paste and other things, after having honoured the cow or the money to be paid in lieu of it, and after referring to the several kinds of sins that one may be guilty of (vide notes) he is to make a gift of & cow (with & calf) to the brāhmana or in lieu of it, of some money.

The Garudapurana (II 4 37) further provides that if a man about to die takes sannyāsa according to the rules laid

Thoughts of a dying man

down for what is called aturasannyāsa he never returns to the cycle of births and deaths, 

From ancient times it was a firmly held belief that the thoughts that a dying man entertains at the time of death determine what will happen to his spirit after physical death (this is expressed in the well-known words 'aats natih sā, gatih'), that therefore a man should, when death approaches, give up all thoughts of mundane affairs and all earthly attachments, should think of his favourite deity. (Hari or Siva), should inaudibly recite such mantras as "om namo Vāgudevāya'. Several texts insist on making the dying man listen to holy Vedic texts. The Gautamapitr-Inedhasūtra (1.1-8) prescribes that one should at the time when one's father, mother, brother, teacher or a brāhmana friend is on his death-bed make the dying man hear the first and last verses of the Veda and certain sūmans and should mutter in the dying man's right ear (one sāman) The Rgvidhāna provides that one should repeat at the time of death the sākta beginning with 'trātāram' 431 (7) 

The Hir. P. S. I. 1 provides that when it is thought that the ālutāgnı is going to die, he (the son or the like) should mutter in the dying man's ear (if he is a knower of Brahma) the two anuvākas of the Tai. Up. II. 1 (beginning with 'brahmavidāpnoti param') and II. 1 (beginning with 'Bhrgurvai vārupih'). The A. K. D. (P 18) says 432 that if the dying man is unable to engage in japa he should revolve in his mind the benign form of Vispu or Siva and should listen to the thousand names (of Vispu or Siva), the Bhagavadgitā, the Bhagavata, Bhārata, Rāmāyada, the Upanisads like Lāāvāsya and hymns to Soma,

Vol. The germs of this idea are found even in the Upanisads, The Chāndogya Up. (in the famous Sandilya-vidyā, III, 14, 1) romarks 'All this is Brahman. A man should meditate on that (all this) as beginning, ending and subsisting in it (Brahman). Now man is a creature of his w]] According to whatever is his vill (or thought) in this world, so will he become after departing from this world.' 433 The Praśna Up. II, 10 contains Q similar idea. It is here asserted that it is thought power or the will that raises the soul higher and higher, and that the human mind should try to realize the idea that behind all physical transformations the Universe is one and is informed by one all-pervading Essence. Similarly, the Bhagavadgita puts this idea in a much more clear way. The man, who romeinbering me alone in his last moments, departs from this life, comes to mo, there is no doubt about this' ( 8,5). But in order to guard against the possible inference that it is only the thoughts at the approach of death that matter whatever the past life led by a dying man may have been, the next verse emphasizes that a man's spirit is engrossed by the thoughts that he has entertained throughout life and that a man can think of spiritual matters or about God at the time of death only if he has been thinking about such matters or about God throughout his life That verse (8.6) is 'whichever form (or thing) a man remembers when he leaves the body at death, to that alone he goes, having been always (throughout his life) engrossed in meditating over it" 

Some of the digests, on the authority of several Puranas, prescribe that the dying man should be taken, if possible, near a holy place (tirtha) such as the Ganges. For example, the Suddhitattva434 (p 299) quotes a passage from the Kūrmapurana to this effect 'a man attains mohsa (final release from samsūra) by dying in the waters of the Ganges, on land or in water at

Vārānasi (Benares) and at the confluence of the Ganges with the sea either on land, in water or in the air.' Another passage to the same effect is quoted from the 'Skanda-purāda and it is further said in the same Purāda that for one gavyūti from the banks of the Ganges is a kşetra (holy place): 'gifts, japa (mut tering of sacred texts), homa performed within this extent is equal to doing the same on the Ganges itself, those who die within this kşeira go to heaven and are not born again. In the Pujāratnākara 435 it is said: 'Hari is present wherever there is the Salagrāma stone; one dying near ā sālagrāma stone reaches the highest abode of Visnu'. It was said that a person (even a non-Aryan) dying within one krosa of a Salagrāma reaches Vaikuntha (world of Visou) Similarly, one dying in a garden of tulasi (Basil) plants or with Tulasi leaf placed in his mouth at the time of death attains moksa even if guilty of crores of sins. These are popular notions held even up to this day among common people, not thoroughly affected by modern ideas. 

There are also dicta about the time when it is best to die. The Santiparva of the Mahābhārata states the who dies after the sun has gone to the northern direction (i. e, when the apparent motion of the sun towards the north begins ) and on any auspicious naksatra and muhurta is really one who has a store of merit (with him ) ' 436 This is based on the ideas of death in Uttarayana and Dakşiņāyana found in the Upanisads. For example, the Chandogya Up. (IV. 15. 5-6 ) states "Now ( if one who knows this dies) whe ther people perform obsequies for him or not he goes to light (arcus ), from light to day, from day to the bright half of the moon, from thence to the six months during which the sun goes to the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the sun, fron the sun to the moon, from the moon to

Those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man, yes, they do not return'. There is a similar passage in Chandogya Up. V. 10.1-2 where it is said that even householders who know the doctrine of the five fires (Pancūgni-indya) and those who in the forest follow the path of faith and austerities (i, e. vānap asthas and parivrājakas wbo do not yet know Highest Brahman) go by the path called Devayāna, while (V, 10. 3—?) those, who, living in a village, practise . sacrifices, works of public utility and alms, go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the dark half of the inoon, from thence to the six months when the sun goes to the south, from thence to the worlds of the fathers, from thence to ether (ahasa) and to the moon, where they consume their works and return again the way they came. The Chān Up. (V, 10. 8) refers to & third place where small creatures (like flies, worms &c.) are continually going and returning. The Br. Up. (VL 2. 15-16 ) contains similar passages about Davaloka, Pitrloka and the third world of worms, birds and creeping beings. The Bhagavadgita, basing itself on these Upanisad passages, puts the matter succinctly (in 8 23-25) as follows:-'I shall state the times at which devotees departing from this world go, never to return or to return, The fire, the flame, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern (apparent) motion of the sun; departing from the world in these those who know the Brahman go to Brahman. Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern (apparent) motion of the sun; dying in these the devotee goes to the lunar light and returns. These two paths, bright and dark, are deemed to be eternal in this world. By the one a man goes never to raturn, by the other he comes back'. The Vedānta sūtra (IV, 3 4-6) explains that the words 'light' 'day' and others are not to be taken in their literal sonse (i, e. as signposts or stages on the paths) but they are to be understood as referr. ing to superintending deities that help the spirits and lead them on the path to the worlds of the Devas or of Pitrs (i e. they are ātrvālekas and abhımānidevatās). Sankara on Vedāntasūtra IV. 2. 20 (ataścāyanepi daksine) explains that the waiting for the -day of Uttarāyada on the part of Bhisma (narrated in the Mahābhārata) is only meant as a eulogy of the path called ,' arcirādi', that one who has realized Brahma, even if he dies in dakşipāyana, does secure the fruits of his knowledge (viz.

teaching Brahma), that Bhisma waited for the beginning of uttar āyana to abide by popular ideas and practices and to show that he possessed the power to depart from the world at his wil owing to the boon conferred on him by his father. The Yajāavalkya-smrti refers to the path (devayāna) 437 that leads to Devaloka (in III. 193-194, where it reads 'mānasah' for *amānavah' of the Ch. Up.) and the Pitryāpa (in II, 195-196). In spite of the interpretations of the Vedāntasūtra (and of Sankara) the popular belief that death in Uttarāyana is best persisted and still persists. For example, the Baud, P.S.(IL.7, 21 ) remarks '(the sages) provide that death during the northern path of the sun, in the bright half of a month, during the day and at the end of a Srauta sacrifice is best43' The G. P. S. (II. 7.1-2) remarks: 'It is desirable to avoid dying in the dark half of a month or at night and the following sūtras provide for the offering of certain oblations if the death occurs in the dark half or at night, 

FI'NERAL RITES (antyesti) are a samskāra. Antyesti is one of the 16 (or more) samskāras of a twice-born person 

437. The words 'devayāna' and 'pitryana' are a legacy from the hoary past. Even in the Rg. there are frequent references to them. Io Rg III. 58 5 the Aśvips are addressed a prayer 'may you come here (to this sacrifice) by the paths leading to the abode of the gods' (eba yalam pathibhırdava yāgaih). Rg. VII 38 8 also has a similat idea 'may you, being gratified, go by the devayāna paths' (trpta yatam pathibbır-devayānaih). In Rg-VII 76.2 (addressed to Usas) the sage Vasistha exclatus that he has seen the Devayāna paths when the dawn shone in the East (pra me pantbā devagāba adrsrap). Agai is asked to make the devayāna paths easily accessible and to carry the offerings in a pleased mood (Rg. X 51.5, sugāa pathaḥ krnuhi devagādāa vaha havyāni samanasyamīdah) Rg. X 98 11 describes Ayni us knowlog the devayāna paths according to the seasons and a prayer is offered to bim to place Aulāda (son of Santanu) in heaven among the gods (vidvan patha stušo devayābān-apyanlānam divi deyesu dhebi). In R8. X 18.1 it is stated that the path of Death is different from devayāna (paran mrlyo ang parehı paotham yaste sva itaro devayānāt). In Rg X 2.7 Agai is said to know the patryāna path (panthamanu pra vidvan pitryānam). In the Ta. Br II 6 3 5 it is said 'I have heard of two paths of the Fathers; I bave heard about the paths of the gods and mortals' (dve sruti ašroavata pitrpām abam devādām-uta martyādātu), The Sat Br. I 9.3 2 remarks "this is the path called Devayāna or Pitryāda.' In the Br, Up. 1.5.16 it is said 'there are indeed three worlds, viz. the world of men, the world of putrs and the world of gods'.

performed with Vedic mantras according to Manu I. 16, Yāj. I 10, Jātūkarnya439. These samskāras were formerly performed for women also (Āśv gc I 15.12, L 166, 1. 17-11, Manu I. 66) but sithout Vedic mantras (except in marriage) and for sūdras algo (Manu X, 127, Yāj I. 10) but without Vedic mantras. The Baud. P.S. III, 1.4 states that there are two samskāras of every human being and they are like a debt i e. they must be fer formed, just as a debt must be discharged viz the samskāra on birth and the one on death (mrtasamskāra). Funeral rites and rites after death varied according as the deceased was an abitāgni (one who had consecrated the śrauta fires) or one who had only kindled the smārta fire, or one who had peither the śrauta fires nor the smārta fire, or a woman, a child, ad ascetic (parıvrājaha), or one dying in a distant land or one dying by accident or committing suicide &c. The srauta and grbya gūbras differ among themselves in many details eten on the same topic and the procedure becomes more elaborate in medieval and later times. It would be impossible to state all the differences on each topic in this section. A separate yojume would have to be written for the purpose of setting out all the variations and. additions from ancient times to modern times, to discuss why and how they arose or vere made, to compare the various sūtras and to compare these again with the puranas and medieval digests, and to appraise their worth or usefulness, All that can be attempted here is to give the bare outlines of the procedure in different sūtras, smrtis and digests by way of sample in a chronological order. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 569 ) expressly says that the last rites differ in each Sabha, though certain things are common to all 439 Chronological conclusions have been drawn about the relative ages of the sātras ( as Dr. Caland does), of the smrtis, purāpas and nibandhas from the presence or absence of this or that detail or the elaboration of this or that ritual But with *all respect to the industrious scholars of the West such conclu sions are often tentative or misleading and are purely subjec tive in many cases and are often due to ignorance or loss of , ancient works,

191 Before setting out the rites of cremation contained in the Šrauta sūtras, Grhya sütras and later works, it would be best to give hero a translation of the five hymns from the Rg. (X. 14-18) 40. The verses in these hymns are employed by most of the sūtras and are used even now in the cremation rites and most of them about in the other Vedic Samhitās. Varying interpretations have been given of some of these stanzas by Indian and Western commentators and critics Only a few of these have been mentioned in the notes. Besides some stanzas are employed for different details of the cremation rites by the different sūtras All such differencos cannot be set out for want of space. The five hymns are so placed that they follow · the order of the stages in which the funeral ritual proceeded in fact and is performed aven now to a great extent. Vide Appendix for the text of the Rgveda hymns without accents.541 

X. 14.1 (Ol sacrificerl) worship with an offering Yama, king (of pitrs), son of Vivasvat, the gatherer of men ( that are dead ), who sought out the way for many (men who do meritorious acts) and who passed along great (non-terrestrial). heights 43. 2.

440. The work of Bertram S Packle on 'Funeral customs' (London, 1926) is a very interesting and instructive one It describes at great length funcral customs in various parts of England, France and other countries in Europe and among Jews and also in other parts of the world. Many of the customs and beliefs that be records bear a close resemblance to customs and beliefs in ancient and modern India, such, as, for example, the alighting of a raven or other black feathered bird on a cottage where a mad is very ill as a death waraing (p 17), washing and anointing of dead bodies before burial (pp. 34, 36), the hinag of professional women for wailiog and sbriek lag for the dead (p 67), condemning burial at night (p 77), the cutting of the hair as a sign of mourning (p. 91). placiog meat and driok on the grave for the spirit of the departed (pp 99-100), refusal of burial in the church yard by the Church for unbaptised children, suicides, lunatics, and those excommunicated (p. 143).

444, Kavgas, Angirases and Rkvaps are different classes of Pitrs In Rg VII 10 4 the Rkvans (singers) are associated with Brbaspati. In other places they are associated with Visau, Aja-Ekapāt and Soma also. The exclamation syābā is uttered when making an offering to Gods and svadba when making an offertag to pitrs

446 Navagvas seem to be a subdivision of Angirases, just as 'dasagvas' are, as jo Rg III 39,5, IV 51 4, V 29 12, X 62.6. The late Mr Tilak in his 'Arctic' home in the Vedas' (pp 162-169) gave a somewhat far-fetched interpretation of these two words which can hardly be accepted as satisfac tory in the presence of words like 'atithigva' (Rg. I 53 8, I 307, II 147, IV 26 3. VIII 68,17). 'abbiyogvan' (Rg VI 45 15), 'etagva' (Rg. VIII 70.7). This verse is explained in Nır XI 19.

(O departed !) proceeding by a good path, hurry on past the two dappled dogs (of Yama), offspring of Saranā, each having four eyes. Thus approach the pitrs who will recognize 449 you and who enjoy delight in the company of Yama 11. O king Yama! Give him (the departed one) in charge of those two dogs of yours, who are guards, having four eyes each, who guard the path (to pitr-loka) and who watch men. May you bestow on him happiness and health! 1%. The two messengers of Yama, that have wide nostrils, that are very strong, that are satisfied with difficulty, move among the people.

Offer to king Yama an oblation which is extremely sveet. Here is salutation to the sages who were born before us and who made the path for us, 

448 This appears to postulate the acquisition of a new etbereal body for the departed enabling him to enjoy the pleasures of pitrloka.

453 This is rather a very obscure stanza The A, V, reads 'pavate' for 'patati'. 'Trıkadruka' occurs frequently 10 connection with Soma (as 10 Rg II 22 1; VIII 92,21). Sāyana explains that for the performance of Trikadruka sacrifices Yama gives protection and that he comes to the six wide ones for supervising over what was done or not done The six are mentioned in Sat Br 1.5 1.22 as fire, earth, water, wiad, day and night The six wide ones are referred to 18 Rg VI 473. The conception is rather vague The meaning probably 18 that in the Trikadruka sacrifices the Brhatsama is sung and it reverberates throughout the universe (symbolized as the six wide ones) and that all the verses recited in the several metres do the same.

X, 17. The verses of this hymn, except 3-6, have hardly any bearing on funeral rites. Therefore only those four verses are translated here. The first two Ferses refer to the marriage of Vivasvat with the daughter of Tyastr and to the legend of. the birth of Yama and Yami from Vivasvat. Both are explained at length in Nir. XI. 10-11. Verges467 7-9 which contain prayers to Sarasvati are almost the same as A. V. 18. 1. 41-43 and are employed by the Kausika-sūtra (81,39) in the cremation rite along with A. V. 7.68 1-2 and 18 3,25. 

3. May the all-knowing Püsan, who does not allow cattle to perish and who protects the world, discharge ( despatch ) you from this ( world to the next) | May he (Pūsan) hand you over to these pitrs and inay Agni hand you over to the gods that know you well! 4. ·M&y Pūsan, who is the life of the Universe and who is himself life, protect you ! May bo wbo is ahead of you guard you on the way (to heaven)! May god Savitr place you in that place where the doers of good deeds went and dwell 5, Pūsan knows all these quarters in order ; may he take us by (a path ) most free from danger! He is the bestower of happiness, full of refulgence, he has all heroes with him; may he (Püsan) the wise one go in front of us without committing a mistakel 6 Püsan exists (stands) in the fore front of the paths (leading to the world of pitrs ), of the paths leading to heaven and of the paths on the earth. He stands facing both the worlds that are very dear (to all) and he, the knowing one, travels towards and away from both. 

X. 18. 1. O Deathl Move aside along another path that is your own and different from the Devayāna path. I address you who have eyes and ears.

It should be noted that the word 'pitr-yajāa' actually occurs in Rg. X. 16. 10. What does it mean? It has to be remembered that the hymns Rg. X. 15-18 refer to rites immediately on the death of a single person. They are not concerned with rites performed for deceased male ancestors long after their deaths. The anxiety (in X. 15-18) seems to be to make the ancient pitrs (styled Barhisadaḥ and Agnisvāttāḥ in Rg. X. 15. 3-4, 11) favourably disposed to the recently departed spirit. Havis (sacrifical food such as boiled rice) was offered to the ancient pitrs (Rg. X 15, 11) who were supposed to have partaken of the food offered (X. 15. 12). The purpose of these Rgvedic hymns is entirely different from the purpose of the mantras in Tai, S. I, 8.5 (which refer to the pitryajāa performed in Sākamedha), As a matter of fact three of the mantras in Tai. S. I. 8.5 do occur in Rg. X. 57. 3.5 and are employed in the piņda-pitryajña, There is hardly any reason to suppose that the pitryajña in Rg. X. 15. 10 is more ancient than the piņdapibryajña, It is quite possible that both referring as they do to different matters were coeval.

479, X. 18. 14. This rerse is rather obscure and vanous interpreta. tions have been proposed by German scbolars (Roth, Grassmana, Ludwig. Geldaer and Oldenberg) and others like Whitney and Hopkins The trans Iation is only tentative, but it probably briogs out the sease in the context much better than many other interpretations. The idea probably is that the speaker wants to disconnect himself from the dead just as a feather may become loosened from as artos that is sbot and therefore he states that he wants to stop addressing the dead and close up all connection with the dead. The Bṛhaddexata (VII. 18-19) remarks on this verse inalta TOTETTA अपहत्येतराणि । अहः पितरो वधुरित्याशास्तेऽस्यपाशिषः॥

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

It would be interesting to see how the ceremonies on the death of an āhutāgni are described in the srauta and grhya sūtras. The Aśv. Sr. S. VI. 10 describes what is to be done in case one that has undergone a diksā (initiation) for a Soma sacrifice or a sattra dies before the sacrifice is finished. It states "When the diksita is dead, they take out the body by the tin tha, 480 place it on the spot where it was intended that avabhrtha (bath at the end of a soma or sattra sacrifice) was to be taken and deck the body with the decorations that ordinarily are placed on a dead body. They cut the hair (on the head) of the corpse, the hair on the lips, the hair on the body and also pare the nails, They apply paste of Nalada (Indian spikenard) to the corpse and throw on it a garland of naladas. Some (having cut open the entrails) take out the feca) matter from them and fill them with prsadājya ( when clarified butter is mixed with curds it is so called ). They cut off a portion as wide as the foot of the corpse from a now ( unworn ) garment and cover the dead body with it in such a way that the fringe is towards the vest (the head being placed towards the east) and the feet of the corpse are exposed to view. The portion cut off from the piece of cloth is taken by the sons and the like. The deceased man's srauta fires are placed on the churning sticks.( the two aranis), the dead body is taken outside the vedi (fire altar) towards its south, fire is produced by attrition and then the body is burnt therewith. After returning from the cremation, they should finish the work of the day. On the next morning, the recitation of the śāstras, the singing of the stotras and the samstavas (reciting hymns in chorus) should be without repetition and the uttaring of the hum sound. On the same day before taking up the granas (cups), the priests come out by the tirtha, go round the place of cremation with the right hand turned away (from the place ) and sit round it in the following manner viz. the hotr priest sits to the west ( of the place of cremation ), tho adhvaryu to the north, and the sāma priests to the west of the adhvaryu (and the brahmā priest to the south). Then the Sāma priests sing in a low voice the verse beginning with "ayam gauh pršnirakramīt' When the singing is finished the hoto walks round the place of cremation thrice with his lett

turned towards the place of cremation and without uttering the syllable 'om' recites immediately after the song of the sāma priests the stotriya in a low voice and also the following verses attributed to Yama and Yamyāyanas (as seers or authors) viz. Rg x 14. 7-8, 10-11, X. 16. 1-6, x. 17. 3-6, X. 18. 10-13,X, 154.1-5. They should finish with Rg..X. 14.12, then collect the charred bones in a jar, take the jar by the way of the tirtha and place it on the seat that was occupied by the deceased sacrificer.481 

The Sankhāyana Śr. S. (IV. 14-15) deals at great length with the death of an āhitāgni and the rites that follow. Kāt. Sr.

The Sat. Br. (XII, 5 2.5) refers to the practice of cleansing the deceased of all foul matter, but does not approve of it It recommends 

baying washed him out inside he anoints with ghee aad thus makes the body sacrificially pure' आयं गौः पृश्निरक्रमीत-is the first verse of the hymn Rg.x.189. 1-3 which are alsos v. No. 630-632 (Aranyakinda) and 1376-78 (Uttarārcika). The hymo also occurs in the other Vedas. The verses are called सार्वराश्य ऋचः. It may be noticed that the Av.gr. (IV.46) prescribes the recitation of the 24 mantras prescribed in the Asy Sr. above and employs some more verses (from Rg x. 14-18) in the ritual set out below from the Āśv. gr. In the Asv Sr, II, 19 there is a description of a rite called 'pitryā karma,' in which offerings are offered in fire taken from the Daksiņāgai and in which the devatās are five viz. Pitarah-somavantab, Soma pitrmāo, Pitarah barhışadah, Pıtaraḥ Agoisvāttāk, Yama, for each of whom three verses are recited respectively in order viz Rg. X. 15. 1, IX.9611,x15.5, Rg 191.1,19112. VIII. 48 13,x.15.4.x 153.x. 15,2: x.15.11,x 1513,४. 15.143 X. 14.4-5, x. 14 1. Rg.x,1612 (repeated thrice) becomes the sāmidbenis jo that rite, X, 14 5 15 Yājpā and X 14,4 and x 14.1 are anuvalyis, Rg. x. 159, IV 113, 1 96.1 are recited when the rite is finished (instead of Agai Svistakst Agai Kavyavābaga is invoked); Rs. 3. 16 11,x. 15.12 are two Samyajyas in Vasatkara. The editor of the Prayogaratna explains that Nalada means "Ušia' (1 e wala la Marathi) and that some substitute japā flowers (china rose) for saladas.

[Vol. S. 25,7 does the same but more briefly. Kāt. (25.7.18) refers to the cutting of hair and nails and taking out fecal matter and Kaus. (80. 13-16), Śān, Śr. 4.14 4-5 also speak of the cutting of hair, of bathing the dead body, applying paste and putting garlands. The Baud. P, S (1 2) refers to these and adds that if they cut open his entrails from the right side they again sev it with darbha grass or they may simply wash the body (without taking out the fecal matter ), cover the body with & piece of cloth, deck it, remove the body by the way between the zed and utkara, place it on a couch (āsandi) over which & black antelope skin was spread with the head to the south, put Nalada garland on it and cover it with an unworn piece of cloth (as in ĀŠv. Śr, above ). Sat śr. 28 1. 22 and G. P. S. 1. 10-14 contain similar provisions adding that the toes of the feet and thumbs of the corpse are tied with a white thread of the fringe of a garmont (baddhvā daśanāngusthau-pādayoh pāpyosca, G. P. S. I 12 ) and that the asandi ( a small couch or chair on which the corpse was carried ) vas to be of udumbara wood, The Kaušikasūtra (80, 3, 3-45) refers to numerous stanzos from À V. that are to be recited in kindling the funeral fire and offering oblations, viz. 18. 2. 4 and 36, 18, 3, 4; 18. 1. 49-50, 58; 18. 1. 41-43; 7. 68 1-2; 18. 3. 25; 18.2 4-18 (omitting 18.2.10); 18.4.1-15 &c. Compare SBE VO), XI p. XLI for Budhist practice. 

The Aśv. gr. 482 (IV.1 and 2) prescribes in general the core monies on the death of an alutāgni, while the Āģy, Sr. S. quoted 

482, It deserves to be noted that the numbering of thc sūtras in Asy. gr. IV, 1-2 differs in different 'editions considerably The rules about the selection of the site for cremation are ancient.

above deals with what should be done in case the āhitāgnz dies while engaged in a Soma or other sacrifice. The Aśv. gr. re marks 'when an āhitāgnz dies, one (a son or other relative) should arrange to have a piece of land dug up to the south-east or south-west at a place sloping towards the south or south-east, or according to some towards the south-vest. The piece of land dug up should be of the length of a man with upraised arms, of the breadth of one vyama-83 and one vrtasta (twelve finger breadths) in depth. The cemetery (smaśāna) should484 be free (open) on all sides. It should abound in herbs, but plants with thorns and with milky juice (should be dug out) as stated before (in Aśy. gr.

(Continued from the last page) 21 3. 27 adds that a bamboo staff with a bundle of grass at its top is carried to the cremation ground and held by a person to the north of the ground while the rites go on and that it is brought back to the house and kept raised at the house. The ground is measured and pegs of palana, sami, varada and a stone are driven into the ground from the east, north, west and south in order. The Sat. Br. XIII. 8. 4,1 mentions pegs (sanku), Sān. Sr. (IV, 14, 6-9) states that the ground of cremation slopes to the south or south-east, that the ground is swept with a palāsa branch with the verse 'apeta' (Rg. X. 14. 9), then it is cleared with the spirya and sprinkled with water and the pile of wood is made to face south-east,

X, 18. 8); the performer (of the rites) should mutter this verse if a sudra (servant) makes her rise and he takes away the bow with the Verse 'dhapur-hastādādadano' (Rg. X. 18. 9). It has been stated (above what is to be done) in case a śūdra (should per form this act), Having strung the bow he should before the piling up of the things (mentioned below on the dead body) is dono, break the bow to pieces and throw it on the pile. 488 He then should put the following sacrificial implements (on the dead body ) viz. into the right hand the spoon called Juhū, in the left hand the spoon Upabhrt, on his right side the Sphya (wooden sword), on his left side the Agnihotrabayanl (the ladle with which the Agnihotra offerings were offered into fire), on his chest, head and teeth respectively the dhruva (the big sacrificial ladle), the dishes (or the kapālas ), the pressing stones (used for pressing out Soma juice in a soma sacrifice), on the two postrils the two small ladles (sruva), on the ears the two Prāśitra-haranas, 289 if there be only one then breaking

He puts the heart (of the animal) on his heart and according to gome also tivo lumps of flour (of rice or barley ); according to others only if there are no kidneys.492 Having deposited the whole animal limb by limb (on corres ponding limbs of the dead body) and having covered it with its own hide he recites when the Pranitā water is being carried forward, by way of invocation the mantra 'imam agne' (Rg. X. 16. 8). Bending his left knes he should offer into the Daksina fire oblations of clarified butter with the formula 'to Agni svāhal To Soma svāhā! To the world spāhāl To Anumati svābāl' A fifth oblation (is to be offered ) on the chest of the deceased with the formula 'from this one, indeed thou hast been born! May he now be born out of thee, N. NI To the heavenly world, syabā' (Vāj s. 35. 22 ). He gives the order *Light the fire together.' Then the Aśv. gr. (IV, 4. 2-5) states what one has to understand if the Abayaniya or Gāghapatya or Daksina fire reaches the dead body first or if all the fires reach the body at the same moment; while the body is burning he recites over it the same texts (Rg. X14, 7 and others quoted above in n. 481 from Ašv. Sr. sūtra ). Being cremated by a person who knows this he goes to the heavenly world together - with the smoke (of the funeral pile)--thus it is known (in the Sruti). After he bas, recited the verse 'ime jīyāb' (Rg. X, 18.3) they (all relatives) turn round from right to left and go away without looking back, When they have come to a place where there is standing water, having once plunged into it and raised their heads out of it they pour one handful of water, pro nounce the gotra name and the proper Dame (of the deceased), 

492. According to Kāt Sr, quoted above in A, 486 the Apostarani animal was to be struck behind the ear and killed. According to Jātākaraya the scveral limbs of the animal were to be placed on the corresponding limbs of the dead body. But Kat. disapproves of this since when burnt there may be a doubt (101 collecting bones) whether they are of the deceased or of the Animal (and so only the flesh of the animal was to be placed on the limbs according to Kāt.). Compare Sat Br. XII 5, 9-12 for similar remarks. Ašv. ET IV 2.4 (as izterpreted by Nārāyana) itself shows that there was an option viz, that the adinal may be bilied or let off and donated to a brālmana (vide also Baud P S 1. 10. 2) The Sāā. Sr. (IV 14. 14-15) states that the bidders were to be taken from the killed or living animal from behind and being slightly heated on the Daksina fire were to be placed in the two hands of the deceased with the two mantras 'ati drava' (Rg. X 14 10-11)

It further provides (28, 1 37-46) that the corpse is carried in a cart or by (four) men and while being carried four stops are made, at each of which clods of earth are dug up and boiled rice is offered thereon with mantras like 'pūsā tretah' (Rg. X. 17 3., Tai Ā VI, 10 1), Sayur vispāyur" (Rg. X. 17. 4, Tai. Ā VI 10.2). The Varāha purāna prescribes that a Paurānic mantra should be recited, that the performer should go round the pyre and apply the kindled fire towards the part of the pyre where the head is placed. 499 ; In modern times the procedure of cremation is generally on the lines of that described in the Asy. gr, cited above and the procedure described in the Garudapurāpa II, 4, 41 ff. The following is a summary of the procedure set out in the Antyesti paddhati of Narāyanabhatta which is generally followed by Rgveding in Western India. The dead body is washed with water, is decked with a talaka on the forehead, is clothed in a garment, is covered with a paste of Jatāmāmsi and a garland of naladas is placed round its neck, Then the performer washes his own fest, sips water, performs prādāyāma without Vedio mantra, then makes a Sankalpa (as in note 500 ),500 he wears his sacred thread under the left shoulder (and on the right shoulder) and prays to the earth with the mantra 'upasarpa' (Rg.

He puts sesame in the mouth of the corpse and prepares a funeral pile sufficient for burning the body by means of sacrificial wood brought by the castemon of the deceased. On that pile he spreads kusa grass and over the latter black antelope skin with the hair outside Then the corpse is oarried to the north of the fire and is placed on the funeral pile with the head to the south. To the north of the dead body, he makes the wife of the deceased sit down. Then the husband's brother, pupil or an old servant makes her get up with the mantra 'udīrsva' (Rg. X. 18. 8). Then the parformer puts pieces of gold in the seven holes of the body (vide above note 491) or drops of clarified butter. He then throws on the body of the departed sesame anointed with ghee, he performs parısamuhana (wiping with the wet hand) of the fire, then paristarana (strewing darbha grass) round the fire together with the funeral pile) and paryuksana (sprinkling water) and brings to the south of the fire the vessels viz proksani, sruya, camasa and the vessel containing clarified butter. Then he puts water in the camasa (oup), covers it with darbha grass and carries it forward and invokes the camasa with Rg. X. 16.8 (imam-agne &c) He makes a sankalpa that he would wait upon (or worship) the dead, takes two fuel sticks and offers them into fire and performs the worship of Agni, Kāma, Loka and Anumati by offering clarified butter in fire with the appropriate formula (viz. agnaye svābā, agnaya idam na mama). Then he offers on the chest of the deceased clarified butter (or prsadājya) (according to some) with the mantra 'asmādvai &c. (vide above note 498). Then he prepares apūpas (balls) with barley flour and mixes them with prsadājya and places portions of the balls on the five parts viz. forehead, mouth, the two arms and chest with the following mantras viz Rg X. 16. 7 (for the ball on forehead and mouth), Rg X. 14, 10 (for the two arms) and Rg. X 14. 11 (for the chest). Then he makes the fire flame up with the mantra Rg. X. 16 9 (kravyādam-agaim) towards the head of a male (and the feet of a woman). Then he should repeat certain mantras while the body is being burnt viz. Rg. X, 14,7-8, Rg. X. 14. 10–11, Rg. X. 16.1-6, X 17.3-6.

Then the jar is completely broken near that part of the funeral pyre whera the head rests The relatives without looking back turn to the left and come out of the cemetery with the young est members first The performer recites Rg 18 3 (ime jīyā &o ). The relatives repair to a spot whera water is flow ing, wearing only one garment and with faces to the south and hair dishevelled, plunge into the water once, sip water, place on the bank that stone (aśman) with which holes were made in the jar, offer water mixed with sesame on that stone with folded hands with the words 'O departed, of such a gotra and of such a namo! May this water mixed with sesame reach you'. The performer offers water with the uttariya for allay ing the thirst (of the departed) due to the burning. 

Many rules were prescribed as regards the carrying of the dead body. It has been seen above that the corpse was carried in a cart or on a couch by the relatives or by the ser yants (dāsas). Some sūtras, spirtis, commentaries and other works lay down many other rules hera The Rāmāyada (Ayodhya 76. 13 ff) states that on the death of Dasaratha his Vedic fires were carried by his priests before the corpse, that the dead body was placed in & palanquin (Sibika), that his servants carried it and that coins of gold and clothes vora thrown about on the road in front of the bier (for the pour), The general rule was that members of the three higaer vardas alone should carry to the cemetery a dead body belonging to any one of those vargas and a šūdra should not carry the dead body of a man of a higher casto (when there vore mon of the caste of the dead available) nor should a man of one of the threa higher varnas carry the dead body of a sudra, in that the impurity in the case of a sūdra carrying a 1840 dvijātı or a duzzati carrying a sūdra's body is determinou by the caste of the dead man, Vida Visau Dh S 19 1-4, Gaut, Dh. S. 14 29, Manu 5 104. Yai H 26. Parāśara IL 43-45. A brahmacarin was not permitted to be a carrier of the dead body of a person or relative even of his owo caste, excapt Dis parents, guru, ācārya and upādhyāya and he was not guilty of breaking his yovs of student-hood if he carried the bodies of any one of the five mentioned above.

Rules about carrying a corpse 

215 

by Yaj. I 34-35. If a brahmacārin carried the corpse of any one except the above five he was held to have swerved from his vrata and he had to undergo the expiation for trafalopa, Manu 5, 103 and Yāj. II 13-14 state that those who merely carry a dead body of their own caste should bathe with the clothes on, then bite off nimba leaves, should perform acamana, touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard, place slowly a foot on a stone and then enter their house It being the duty of sapindas 501 to carry the dead body of their relative they, after doing so, had simply to bathe, to touch fire and drink clarified butter for being pure (Gaut. 14, 29. Yāj. IL. 26, Manu IV. 103. Parāśara II. 42, Devala q. by Par. M. 1 %, p. 277, Harīta q. by Aparārka p. 871). Carrying the dead body of a brāhmaga who has no relatives is highly extolled by Parāśara (III 39-41) who says that a person, that thus carries the dead body of a brāh mapa, secures at each footstep the reward of the performance of a sacrifice and he becomes pure at oncs simply by plunging into water and performing prādāyāma, while Manu (5. 101–102) prescribes that if one carries the dead body of a person who is not a sapında through affection he becomes pure after three days. The Hāralatā p. 121 quotes the Adipurāda that if a ksatriya or vaisya cremates the dead body of a poor brahmana or of a ksatriya who has lost everything or of a poor Faiśya, he secures great merit and becomes pure at once after a bath. Even now generally (particularly in villages) men of the same caste carry or follow a dead body and are held to be purified by a bath with clothes on. The medieval commentaries like the Mitakşarā stuck strictly to the extreme exclusiveness of caste by prescribing 'if a man sua carries a dead body through affection, eats food in that family and dwells in their house he is under impurity for ten days; if he simply stays with the dead man's family but does not eat their food he is impure for three days; these rules apply when the carrier is of

the same caste as the dead person But if a brāhmana carries a Śūdra's corpse, the brāhmana is impure for a month, but if & Śūdra carries a brāhmana's body the sūdra is impure for ten days. The Kūrmapurāda prescribes that if a brāhmana carries the dead body of a brāhmana for a fee or from other interested motive he becomes impure for ten days, a ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra doing the same becomes impure for 1%, 15 or 30 days and the Vispupurāpa says that the person carrying a dead body for a fee has to become impure for the period of impurity prescribed for a man of that caste, It may be stated that these rules about impurity on the ground of carrying or following the carrying of a dead body of another caste are no longer enforced and it is extremely doubtful whether they were ever strictly enforced or followed Harsta 503 prescribes that a dead body should not be carried through the midst of a village if wbile going to the cemetery a village comes in the way, but it should be carried away from it. Manu, 592 and Vrddha-Hārīta IX, 100-101 prescribed that the dead body of a šūdra, vaisya, ksatriya and a brāhmana was to be taken out respectively by the southern, western, Dorthern and eastern gates of the town or village It was provided by Yama and the Garudapurāna II 4 56-57 504 that the fuel for the funeral pyre should not be carried (for higher varnas) to the cemetery by a südra and if a šūdra did so the deceased would always remain in the state of preta The Hāralatā (p 121) says that if firewood is carried by sūdras still the pyre should be made by brāhmanas only (for a brāhmapa's body). The smrtis and purāpas provide that the corpse 505 should be first bathed with water and then cremated, that the corpse should never be burned naked, but that it should be covered with cloth, decked with flowers and have fragrant unguents (sandalwood

The Brahmapurāpa (q. by Suddhiprakaśa p. 159) states that when carrying a dead body to the cemetery, a great deal of noise should be created by means of the four kinds of instru. ments. 506 

There were differing rules laid down about rapana (shaving) for the performer as an auxiliary (anga) of the rite of cremation, after the cremation and bath thereafter. A smrti text provides 507 

shaving of the head and moustaches is declared in seven cases, viz. on the Ganges, at the Bhāskaraksetra, on the death of the mother or father or guru, on consecrating the frauta fires and in a Soma sacrifice'. The A KD (p. 19) prescribes that the son or other performer of the rites of cremation should first perform vapana and thep bathe, then carry the dead body to a sacred spot, bathe it there, or if such a spot is not at hand should invoke the presence of the Ganges, Gayā and other tirthas in the water to be used for washing the dead body, then anoint it with ghee or sesame oil, again bathe it and put on it a fresh garment, should deck it with yarnopavīta, gopicandana, garland of basil leaves and then should apply to the wbole body fragrant subst. ances like sandalwood paste, camphor, saffron, musk &c. But if the cremation took place at night, there was to be no vapana at night, but on the next day.508 Other smrtis allowed vapana on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or 7th or any following day up to the offering of śrāddha on the 11th day.509 Áp Dh, S.

provides sio zapana for all sapindas that are younger than the deceased The Madanapārijāta holds that the performer of orema. tion rites had to undergo vapana on the first day and also on the expiry of the period of impurity, while the Suddhiprakasa (p 162) following the Mit on Yāj. ITI 17 states that the day on which vapana is to be undergone is determined by the usage of each country. This difference in usages has been even judicially noticed. In Chandra choora Deo v. Brbhuti Bhushan Deva A,I R. 1945 Patna p. 211 at p. 219 it has been stated that according to the Benares School the person who performs the cremation shayes his head at the time of cremation, whereas under the Mithilā school there is no such shaving at that time. 

The Garudapurāpa (II. 4. 67-69) provides that loud weeping may be indulged in when the body is burning but there should be no weeping after cremation and the offering of water to the departed, 

There was some difference of opinion as to the offering of water (udakakriyā or udakadana) to the deceased by his sapindas and samānodaloas ĀŚy gr, quoted above (p 209) speaks of offering water once, but the Sat, Śr 28 2. 72 and others prescribe that water mixed with sesame is offered thrice with joined hands on the day of death to the deceased after reciting his gotra and name and every day thereafter up to the 11th,511 Gaut Dh. S. 14. 38, Vas. 4 12 presoribe that water should be offered by sapindas to the deceased with their faces to the south on the first, third, seventh and ninth days of death and Haradatta says that in all 75 añjalis of water were to be offered (threa on 1st day, 9 on 3rd, 30 on 7th and 33 on 9th ), but that the usage in bis country was that on the first day water was offered three times with joined hands and then one more anjali on each succeeding day from the 2nd.

Views on offering water prescribe that water and pinda were to be offered to the deceased for ten days.512 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 202 ) quotes Terses from Gphyd-pariśista, one of which says that some declare that only ten añjalis were to be offered, some say 100 Tere to be offered and others that 55 vere to be offered and that one should follow the usage settled in one's vedic Sākha. The ĀŠv. gr. parisista 3. 4 has & similar rule in prose The Garudapurāna (Pretakhanda chap. 5 yerses 22-23 ) also refers to the offering of 10, 55, or 100 anjalis. Some smrtis prescribed that the number of añjalis of water were dependent on the caste of the deceased. Pracetas (q. by Mit. on Yāj. ITI. 4) provides that 10, 12, 15, 30 añjalis should be respectively offered to a deceased person of the brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra Varna, Yama (verses 92-94 ) states how water is to be offered to the deceased standing in navel-deep vater and (98) pre scribes that water is to be offered in water to gods and pitis but on the ground to those that died without upanayana being performed. In a smrti quoted by Devayājnika 513 it is stated that six pindas Tere to be offered from the day of death as follows: at the place where the death occurred, at the door of the house, where four roads meet, where the funeral procession on the way to the cemetery rested, on the pile of Food arranged for burning (cita), and at the time of the collection of the burnt bones. It was further provided that for the benefit of the departed a lamp fed by sesame oil was to be kept burning continuously for ten days after death and an earthenware Yessel was to be kept filled with water and a handful of cooked rice was to be offered on the ground at the time of the mid-day meal after uttering the name and gotra of the departed. This was called pātheya śrāddha because it helped the departed to go on his way from the earth to the world of the departed (Tide Dharmasindhu p 463). According to some of the digests

a śrāddha called Nagna-pracchadana was to be performed on the day of the death of a person after his sapindas undergo sharing and bath, enter the village and the house. It consists in filling a jar with grains of rice wound round with a piece of oloth and putting clarified butter in a vessel of bell-metal and some gold (or coins) thereon according to one's ability. The whole was to be given to a poor brāhmada of good family after romembering Visou for the benefit of the departed Vide Smrtı muktāphala (on śr ) pp. 595-596, Sm C (on Aśauca p. 176 ),

The smrtis and purānas (like Kūrma, uttarārdha 23.70 ) prescribe that after offering with joined hands water to the deceased a ball of rice or barley flour with sesame was to be presented on darbha grass There are two views on this point, According to Ya. III, 16 a pinda vas to be offered for three days after death according to the procedure prescribed for Pinda-pitr-yajña (such as wearing of the sacred thread on the right shoulder and under the left shoulder ), while according to Vispu 19. 13 one pinda was to be offered every day as long as impurity on death lasted The pinda was to be offered on darbhas spread on the ground if the deceased had his upanayana performed, but without mantras or may be offered on a stone sly While water could be offered by any and every sapinda, pioda was to be offered only by the son (and when there were many sons, by the eldest if free from defect); in default of a son the nearest sapinda like a brother or brother's son was to offor it and in default of such then the sapindas of the mobbet (materna) uncle, his son or the like ) could 515 offer it. Even when pindas were to be offered for three days or āśauca lasted only for 3 days the pipdas were prescribed to be ten by Satatapa and Paraskara distributed them as follows three on the irsu day, four on the 2nā and 3 on the third and Dakga *** d1801)* buted them as follows. one on the first day, four on the 2nd and fiya on the 3rd Paraskara prescribed that 10, 12, 15, 30 pindas were to be offered according to the varna of the deceased i the case cited above from A I R. 1945 Patna p 211 at p 219 jt has been stated that according to the Benares school 4, 5 oro

II Views on pinas at cremation 

pindas are offered at the time of cremation, while according to the Mithilā" school only. one pioda is offered. Everybody, whether a person of the same gotra as the deceased or of another gotra, had to carry out all the rites up to the tenth day wlien he once began them on the day of death, as stated by the Grhya-parišista 517 and Garudapurāpa. It is further prescribed that when the funeral sites are begun by a person and then a nearer Telatiye such as a son comes, even then the former is to carry on all the rites up to the 10th day, but the rites of the 11th and later days are to be performed by the son and in default of him by a near sapinda. The Matsyapurāna states 518 that pindas should be offered to the deceased for twelve days; they become his food on his journey (to the other world) and they give bim satisfaction; since the deceased is taken to the abode of departed spirits after twelve days, he (his spirit) sees his house, sons and wife for twelve days Rsyaśroga quoted by Aparārka (p. 889 ) specifies the limbs of an ethereal body with which the deceased is endowed on each day of the ten days after death when a pinda is offered The Garudapurāpa (pretakhanda chap. 5. 33-36) says the same. 

Just as sapindas of the same gotra and samānodakas were bound to offer water to the deceased, & person was bound to offer water to his maternal grandfather and to the two further ancestors and to his ācārya on their death. Every man, if he 80 desired (i. e, he was under no religious duty), could offer water to his friend, to his married sister or daugbter, to his sister's son, father-in-law and his sacrificial priest on their death (Pār. gr. III, 10, Sankha-Likhita, Yāj. 519 IL, 4) Paraskara (III. 10) refers to a peculiar practice. When the sapindas are about to enter water for bathing and thereafter offering water to the deceased they pray to their relatives or brother-in-law for water with the words 'we shall perform udakakriya , where-upon

the other roplios do so but don't come again (with a similar request),' if the deceased was less than one hundred years of age, but the reply would be simply do so if the deceased Tas hundred years of age or more.520 The G. P. S. (1, 4,4-6) has & somewhat similar symbolic dialogue. A king's officer, a sagotra or a brother-in-law takes a branch having thorns and provents them from entering water with the words 'don't enter'; then the sapindas should reply 'we shall not again enter Water'. The probable significance of this was that they thereby vould be able to escape from another death in the family soon after, 

There were rules prohibiting certain persons from offering water to the deceased and also directing that water should not be offered to certain deceased persons. Impotent 521 persons and the like, thieves of gold, vrātyas, those who follow forbidden conduct and women that kill their own foetus or husband and that drink the kind of liquor (forbidden to them) should not offer water to a deceased person. Yaj (III. 6) provides that water should not be offered to and no āśauca observed for heretics, for those who do not belong to one of the four āśramas, to thieves, to women wao kill their husbands or who are guilty of prostitu tion or who drink surū, or who commit suicide. Manu (V. 89 90) is to the same effect, Gaut Dh, S. 522 14, 11 provides that in the case of those who start (through anger) on the Great

To whom no water is to be offered

Journey, who commit suicide by fasting or by means of a weapon or by fire, by poison, in water, by hanging or falling from a precipice or tree, there is no oremation, no asauca, Do offering of water or pinda. Haradatta on Gazt, 14. 11 quotes three verses froni Brahmapurāpa that those who die of a brāhmana's curse or black magic and those who are patitas are dealt with in the same way. But Angiras (9. by Mit, on Ya). II, 6) says that if one dies by water or fire or the like through inadvertence, there was āśauca for him and udakakriya tras performed. Vide Vaik, Sm S. V. 11 for a long list of persons who must not be cremated. In the Mahābhārata the rites of cremation have been described frequently eg. the cremation of Pandu in Adiparva, chap 127 ( the body was carried in a frika covered on all sides, there were musical instruments, the royal parasol and chowries were carried in the procession, distribution of vealth to mendicants, carrying the dead body to the bank of the Ganges on a charming sylvan spot, bathing the body, applying sandalwood paste to it), of Drona in Strīparya, chap 23.38-42 (three samans were sung, his pupils with Dropa's wife in front vent round the funeral pyre, going to the Ganges ); of Bhisma in anusāsana 169 10-19 (fragrant resins were used on the pyre, his body was covered with fine clothes and flowers, an umbrella and chowries were held over the body, Kaurava vomen fanned the body with fans, sāmans vere sung ); of Vasudeva in Mausalaparva 7. 19-25; of killed Warriers in general in Striparya, chap. 26. 28-43 and of Kunti, Dhrtarāstra and Gandhārl in ' Aśramayasikaparya, chap. 39. In the Rāmāyana ( Ayodhyā, chap 76 verses 16-20 ), it is said that the funeral pyre for Daśaratha was made with sandalwood, aguru and fragrant resins, with Sarala, Padmaka and Devadāru (pine) wood and various fragrant substances were heaped thereon, then Daśaratha's body was placed on the pyre and that Kausalyā and other women followed the corpse in &:blikās and conveyances aocording to their status, 

If an āhitāgni died away from home, the Sat. Br. (XI, 5.1.13-14) provides that, having brought his bones home they were to be spread on a black antelope skin and arranged in imitation of the human frame, were to be covered with wool and ghee and burnt with his srauta fires and sacrificial imple ments. Similar rules are laid down in Kāt. Śr, 25.8-9, Baud. P.S, HII 8, Gobhilasmrti 11,47, Vas. Dh, S. IV, 37,

If even the bones could not be found, then the sūtras follorya ing the Azt Br. (chap. 32.1) and similar ancient workg523 provide that on a skin of black antelope one should make the effigy of a human frame with palāśa stalks (leaves) 360 in 521 pumber, the effigy should be bound round with woollen thread, should be covered with yava flour mixed with water and anointed witl clarified butter and cromated with his fires and sacrificial implements. The Brahmapurana (q. by Suddhi prakas& p. 187) contains similar rules about burning an efigy and ordains three days' impurity thereafter. Acc. to a smrti (a by Aparārka p. 545), the palūša leaves were to be 362. They were to be distributed according to Baud. PS and Gaut. P S. as follows: 40 represent the bead, 10 the neck, 20 the chest, 30 the abdomen (udaa), 50 each of the arms, 10 the fingers of the two hands, 70 each of the two legs, 10 the toes of the feet, 8 the male organ, 12 the testicles.

Jātākarnya (a by Aparārka p. 545 ) and Bhavisyapurāpa (q. by Suddhi. prakāśa p. 187 ) say that when a son does not hear for 15 years about his father who had gone to a distant land, he should perform the cremation of the effigy (called 'akrtidahana'). Bghaspati advises waiting for 12 years before resorting to akrtidalang (Suddhipr. p 187). The Vaikhānasa-sinārta-sutra V. 12 regards the burning of the effigy as a meritorious act for every one and does not restrict it to the case where the body or bones are not found. The Suddhiprakāśa p. 1897 quotes several Verses from the Brahmapurāpa that the procedure of burning an effigy of palāśa stalks was to be followed even in the case of one who has not consecrated Srauta fires and āšauca for three days has to be observed, while the aśauca for burning the effigy of an ābitagpi was ten days. 

It is further provided in Sat śr. 29, 4. 41, Baud P.S. (II, 7. 4) and Garudapurāna II, 4. 169–70 that, if after the effigy is cremated in the belief that a person died in a foreign land, he returns alive, then he is plunged in a pit containing clarified butter and then he comes out of it, takes a bath, then all the sainskāras from jātalarına are performed on him, then be marrieg the same wife again or if she be dead, he may marry another girl, then consecrate again śrauta fires. Some sūtras provide that if the wife of an āhitāgni dies before him, he may, if he so desires, cremate her with his srauta fires or be may cremate her with fire prepared from covdung and some easily inflammable things (like straw) placed in three sthālis (cooking pots 526). Manu (V. 167-168) provides that if the savarna and virtuous wife of a twice-born person who had consecrated sacred srauta fires died before him she was to be cremated with big fires (srauta and smārta) and with the sacrificial implements. Then he may marry again and consecrate srauta or smārta fires again, To the same effect are Yā). T. 89, Baud.

X. 14) and the versos in honour of the god Yama, Manu V 70, however, states other optional provisions viz, that the offering of water may be done (and therefore the cremation also of the dead body) in the case of infants that have struck teeth or after nāmakar ana. Thereforo there is an option as to cre mating an infant of less than two years, viz it may be buried or cremated after nāmakarana or after the appearance of teeth. In this case it is not necessary that all the sapında relatives should follow the dead body If a child is two years old or more at death and upanayana has not been per formed it must be cromated with ordinary fire and water must be offered silently. The same rule applies to a child whose cūčā (tonsure) had been performed before death as stated by Laugāksi. 528i The Vaik, Sm. S. V.11 lays down that there is no burping with fire until the 5th year for a boy and the 7th year for a girl After Upanayana the chuld was to be cremated according to the rites prescribed for an āhitāgoi 80 far as they could be applied (i, e, there would be cremation without sacrificial implements and the mantra 'asmat tvam abbijātosı' was not to be recited) The Baud 529 P. S.

It also provides that infants that have struck no teeth are to be buried with syllable 'om' and those that have had teeth with the Vyāhrtis The Mit. on Yaj. III 2 summarises the rules as follows: Before Nāmakarana there was to be only burial and no offering of water and the like; after Nāmakarapa up to the third year cremation and offering of water are optional with burial, from the third year up to upanayana there is cremation and also offering of water but silently (without mantras ), If Oūdā ceremony was performed before the 3rd year and the child died then also the same rule applied. After Upanayana the deceased vas to be cremated with ordinary fire but the procedure was to be the same as for an āhitāgni,

Disposal of an ascetic's corpse 

A yati (sannyāsin) was and is even now buried. In a previous note (n, 528b) a verse of Kratu is quoted that a brahmacārin and yati are to be cremated with uttapana fire, The explanation of the Suddhiprakāśa (p. 166 ) is that the word yati here means an ascetic of the Kutīcaka kind and quotes a 530 verse as to how the dead bodies of the yatis of four grades are to be disposed of. The 531 Baud. P. S. IIL11 gives a brief description which is adopted with some variations by the . Smrtyarthasara (p. 98) that contains a description of the death rites of a parivrājaka. 532 One slould go to the east or north of the village, he should dig ā pit (lit, a sacrificial place) as deep as the staff ( carried by the yati) under a palāśa tree or on a river bank or on some other pure spot to the accompaniment of the vyjālirtis; then he should sprinkle water thereon thrice repeating the seven vpāhrtis each time, should spread darbha grass on the bottom of the pit, should deck the dead body (with garlands, sandal paste ), deposit the body in the pit with the mantra (Tai 8.1.1.3.1) 'O Visnul guard this offering (the dead body ).' He should place in the right hand the staff of the parivrājaka (breaking it into three parts ) with the mantra ' Visnu took strides over this' (Rg. I.22.17, Vaj. S. V.15, Tai. S. 1.2,13,1). He places the skija (loop of strings ) in the left

He then inpokes with the mantras beginning with 'cittih sruk' (ten sentences in Tai, Ā, Maitrāyani S 19 1 which are called 'oaturhotārah") 533 The other rites are not performed here as they were performed before No cremation should be done, no āśauca should be observed nor should water be offered to (an ascetic who is dead) who was free from all attachments and who had given bimself up to meditation, The Smrtyarthasāra adds that no ekoddista śrāddha nor sapindīkarana ss performed for an ascetic, but only par vana on the 11th day, that a kutīgaka should be cremated, the babūdaka should be buried, hansa should be thrown into water and paramahamsa should be thoroughly buried. The Nidayasindhu (pp 634-635) quotes the Smrtyartha sāra and then adds a few details from Brhat-Saunaka, riz that the dead body of a yatr should be bathed with the Purusasūkta (Rg X, 90), then the pit (dug for burial) should be sprinkled eight times with the syllable 'Om'on all sides; having deposited the body in the pit with the Yajus formula 'O Visnu i guard this offering. (Tai S I 1. 3.1) and with 'Om', he should place in the right hand the staff with the mantra "Visou took strides over this' (Rg. I 22. 17), then pierce the crown of the head with & conch by repeating the mantra 'bhür-bhuvah-svah', be should fill up the pit with salt to the recitation of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90). He should fill up the pit thoroughly (with sand) in order to guard against jackals and dogs and the like (exhuming the body with their paws) The Dharmasindhu (p 497) adds some details particularly as to the number of hymns and mantras to be repeated It states that the crown of the head should be pierced with a conch or an axe. that one who is unable to do this gliould smash a ball of jaggery placed on the head. It adds that no yati except kuticaka should be cremated. In modern times a sannyāsin is always buried and not cremated, since kuticaka and babūdaka kinds of pati are no longer in vogue and it is only the paramahamsa that is prevalent in the whole of India.

Why ascetics were not cremated 

appears to me to be as follows; part of the procedure of becoming an ascetic consisted in giving up his srauta fires and throwing in fire his sacrificial wooden implements (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 954). One of the rules for ascetics is that he should not kindle siauta or smārta fires por kindle ordinary fire for cooking his food but was to subsist on cooked food obtained by begging (HI, of Dh. yol I pp. 933-934). The householder was cremated with his srauta or smārta fire but the ascetic, having abjured these, was without any fire and was therefore buried. The Vaikhanasasmārtasútra X. 8 (ed. by Caland ) contains a brief description of the burial of an ascetic who was not an āhitāgni and the cremation of an ascetic who was āhitāgni, 

Special rules were laid down about the cremation of women dying in or immediately after child-birth and women dying while still in their monthly illness. A smrti quoted by the Mit and the Smrti-candrikā (I p. 121) provides that in the case of a sütehū, one should take water and pancagavya in a jar, should repeat holy texts (such as "apo hi sthā' Rg. X. 9. 1-9, verses addressed to Varuna) over them, should then bathe the sütikā with water and pañcagavya and then cremate the body. A woman in her monthly illness was to be similarly bathed and she was to be covered with another garment and then cremated. Vide Garudapurāna I 4. 171 ff and Nirnayasindhu p. 621. Similarly, elaborate rules are pres cribed about the rites of cremation in relation to the death of & pregnant woman (vide Baud P. S. II, 9, Nirnayasindhu p. 622) which are passed over here. 

Dead bodies were disposed off in different ways at different times and in different countries The various methods of dis posal vere cremation, burial underground, water burial, expo sure of the body for being destroyed $34 by vultures and other birds (as among Zoroastrians) or beasts, being preserved in

caves, 535 or being mummified (as in Egypt). The general rulo in India froin times of which we have literary evidence was cremation; though burial took place in certain cxceptional cases such as in the case of infonts, ascetics &o How tho ancient Indians hit upon this scientific though rather heart lending method of the disposal of dead bodios it is difficult to say 536. Burials were not unknown in India eren in rory carle times, as Atharvareda 5. 30 14 (mā nu bhumigrho bhurat) and 18 2 34 show. The last may be rendered as follows: O Agnil bring all those piits here in order that they may par take of the offering, those (pitrs whose bodies) were buried or cast aside (exposed) or burnt or deposited above (on troos or in caves ? )s36. In the word 'anagnidagdhāh' occurring in Rs. X. 15. 14, scholars soe a reference to burial. But it is quito possible that no burial is referred to. If some ancestors worc killed far from home in a fight or if they wore kidnapped and killed by enemies, their bodies might havo beon Jeft uncared for in a distant land and not cremated nor buriod. A passage in the Chāndogya 537 Up. (VIII, 8. 5) is construed by some scholars as referring to burials. It may be rendored as followy. Therefore they designate evon now a man, an asura who dong not make gista, who has no faith and who offors no sacrifices; for this is the esoteric doctrino of Asiiras. They dock out the body of the dead with bhihsā (perfumes and forers ?), with s raiment by way of decoration, and think that they will thuis conquer the next world. Though the passage is not quito clear, the reference to Asuras, their usage of docorating the dead body and thereby being able to gain the nort world sonder it probable that the usage of the burial of the body among Asuras is roforred to.

may I not go to the earthen house'. This is probably & re ference to buria). Besides, after the charred bones were collec ted, they were placed in an urn or pot, which was buried in the ground and after a good deal of time & mound (śmaśāna) was built upon the bones as will be seen immediately from a passage in the Sat Br, and other sources In A V. XVIII % 25 it is said, 'may the tree not oppress them, nor the great goddess Earth'. This is probably a reference to a coffin and burial. 

It is somewhat curious that the progressive nations of the West, believing in a literal interpretation of the Biblical words (such as Matthew 22.23-33, Mark 12. 18-27 and Luke 20. 37-38, John 5. 19-31 and 6. 32-56) about physical resurrection of the dead, held fast by burial alone and up to the end of the 19th century people in Christendom would not allow the cremation of a dead body. The case of Reg. v. Price illustrates how deep the sentiment against cremation was and how popular fury prevented Price from disposing of the body of his dead child of five months by petroleum fire in a field, how he was prosecuted for two offences viz. misdemeanor at Common Law for burning a dead body instead of burying it and misdemeanor on the ground that he attempted to burn the body with intent to prevent an inquest being held on it by the coroner.538 It was only in 1902 that the Cremation Act (% Edw. 7 Ch. 8) was passed empowering burial authorities to establish crematoria on plans approved by the Minister of Health. The Catholic Church does not even now allow cremation. The ancient Romans on the other hand held crepation as the honourable means of the disposal of the dead body but reserved burial for the suicide and the murderer. 

Embalming the dead for some time at least was not quite unknown in India. The Sat, Śr, 29. 4, 29 and Vaik. Śr, 31.23 539 prescribe that if an ābitāgni died away from his people his corpse should be laid down in a tub or trough filled with sesaine oil and brought home in a cart.

What the state of things was before the composition of tho Rgveda cannot be said with certainty. There is no general agreement as to the age of the Rgveda and of the ruins found at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Sir John Marshall (in Mohonjo daro vol. I. p. 86) refers to complete burials, partial burials and post cremation burials. The excavations at Lauriga sil Nandan garh have brought to light supposed Vedio burial mounds in which has been found a small repousse golden plaque bearing the figure of a nude female, the Earth Goddess These and the disposal of corpses in paleolithic ages are matters for archaoo logists and are outside the proper scope of the present work. 

The Hāralata (p. 126 ) quotes a passage from the Adipurada to the effect that Magas (Magians) are buried undorground and that Daradas and Luptrakas (?) go away after placing their dead relatives on trees. S41a 

It appears that among early Buddhists in India hardly any religious ceremony was performed, whether the person docoased was a layman or even a member of the Order. In tho Mahāparinibbāna Suttanta the death and the funeral cererronios of the great founder of Buddhism are described in chaptor V ( Section 14 ff). All that is gathered from that chapter is that the favourite disciple of the Buddha, Ananda, uttered a stanza, some of the disciples that were not free from passion wept and fell beadlong on the ground, while others (who wora Arobots) bore the grief with composure, that next morning Ananda went to the Mallas of Kusinārā, that the Mallas took perfumea,

garlands, all musical instruments and five hundred suits of apparel, the Mallas passed seven days in paying bomage to the body of the Buddha that lay in the sala grove with dancing, hymns, music, garlands and perfumes, in making canopies of their garments, that on the 7th day they carried the body of the Blessed One to the south but owing to a miracle (described in sections 29-32) they carried it through the city by the north gate and laid the body to the east (the general rule was that a dead body was not to be carried through the middle of a village, and was to be carried to the south but as Buddha was so extraordinary and holy the above was allowed to be done ). The body of the Buddha was then wrapped in a new cloth, then with cotton wool, then in a new cloth and so on till 500 layers of cloth and cotton wool covered the body The body was then placed in an oil vessel of iron which was covered with another oil vessel of iron, Then a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes was built upon which the body was placed. Then Mahākassapa and five hundred brethren accompanying him arranged their robes on one ahoulder (representing the way in which the sacred thread is arranged among the brābmapas), bowed down with clasped hands, went round the body reverently thrice, The body was then burnt and only bones remained. Then the narrative states that Ajatašatru, king of Magadha, the Licohavis of Vesāli and several others claimed portions of the relics of the Buddba. Then the relics were divided into eight parts. Those who received them built mounds (Thüpas) over the relics and the Moriyas who got only embers also built a Thüpa over them and a brahmana Dona (Drona) built a mound over the jar (kumbha) in which the bones were collected. Mr. Rhys Davids remarks (8. B. E vol. XI Introduction p. XLV) 'though funerals are naturally not infrequently mentioned in the historical books and in the Birth stories there is nowhere any reference to a recognised mode of performing any religious worship'. It will ba noticed that the Buddhist ritual 512, though simple, agrees closely with some of the rules of Ašv. gr.

As the departed spirit, being helpless, has to swallow the tears and phlegm cast by kinsmen, they should not weep but should perform (obsequial) rites according to their ability.' Gobhilasmrti III. 39 urges 'do not lament for what is perishable and what is the characteristic (destiny) of all beings. Exert yourselves in the performance of meritorious acts which will accompany you' Gobhila then quotes Yāj. TI, 8-10 and one verse from the Mahābhārata 544a viz. 'All collections are to end in dissipation, all rise is to end in fall, all unions in separa tion and life in death'. Aparārka quotes the Rāmāyana and Vasudeva's words from the Salyaparya to Dhrtarāstra on the death of Duryodhana, The Par. M. 1.2 pp. 292–93, the Suddhi prakāśa pp. 205-206 and several other works quote the verges of Vispu, Yāj. and Gobhila. 

The Garudapurāna here (II. 4. 91-100) waxes eloquent over the immolation of a wife on her husband's funeral pyre, over the miraculous power of a pativratā, and states that a brāhmana woman should not burn herself apart from her husband's body (or afte, he is cremated), but that ksatriya and other women may do so, that the practice of sati is common to all women even including chandāla women, but pregnant women or those that havo young children should not do so and that a woman does not beconie free from the liability to be born again and again as a woman until she becomes a Sati. 

After listening to the philosophical discourse of elders the relatives return to their house, placing children in front and standing at the door of the house, they with minds under control bite the leaves of the nimba tree, perform Öcamana, touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard; then they should enter their house after slowly , (firmly) planting their foot on a stone.

let them eat no mineral salt or ordinary $48 salt for three nights, let them optionally avoid for twelve nights the distribution of gifts and the study of vedic texts if one of the principal gurus (father, mother or the teacher who performed upanayana and taught the whole Veda) dies. Pār. gr. IIL 10 adds that they should remain chasto, eat food only once in the day and that they should not repeat Veda study, and should give up the daily obligatory duties except those connected with Vedic fires. Manu (V. 73) adds that they should not eat flesh for three days. Vas. (4.14-15 ) lays down that the relatives who returned from the cemetery should sit down for three days on mats and fast, that if they are unable ( to fast for three days ) they should subsist on food bought in the market or obtained unasked. Ya. III 17 and Pār. III, 10 549 provide that for the night they should put milk and water in an eartben Tessel in the open space (on a szkya) with the words 'O departed onel bathe here (in the water) and drink this milk'. Yāj III, 17, Paithinasi, Manu V. 84, Par. gr. III 10, and others state that the relatives of the departad should perform their own daily rites to be performed in the frauta fires (such as Agaibotra and Darsapūrpamāsa) and in the smārta fire (such as morning and evening homa) on account of the peremptory dictates of the Veda (such as one should perform Agnihotra as long as one lives'). The commentators have added several limitations and restri ctions. The Mit.553 on Yā). III, 17 states that, as Manu V, 84 only prohibits the stopping of the rites in (Vedio and Smarta ) fires, such religious duties as the five daily Mahayajñas are excluded, that Vaišvadeya, though performed in fire, is excluded because there is an express text of Samyarta & brāhmapa should be without Vaišvadova for ten days ( after the death of a sapinda ), that the Srauta and Smārta rites should be got per formed by another, as Pāraskara (III 10'anya etāni kuryuh) expressly lays down Only nziya and narmittaka acts to be parformad in Vedic and Smārta fires are allowed and so Icāmya rites cannot be performed.

perform their srauta nitya homa during days of impurity them selves, though some get it performed by another (Vide Yā). III, 17, Manu V 84). Although there is a text of Gobhilasmrti (III 60 ) prohibiting the performance of sandhya, yet relying on & sūtra of Paithinasi the Mit says that a man can offer water to the Sun in worship; others like the Sertimuktāphala (p. 478) say that sandhyā mantras may be revolved in the mind, except the prāpāyāpia mantras. This is followed in modern times in many parts of India. Visnu Dh, S, 226 prescribas that in impurity due to birth or death homa (Vaišvadeva ), giving and accepting gifts and the study of Voda ceasa, The Vaiks Sm, S. VL4 states that the perform enga of sandhyā adoration, all rites for the gods and manes, gift and acceptance and Veda study should be given up during impurity on death. Gautama 14,44 appears to hold that a brāhmana is not affected by impurity on birth and death for the purposes of Veda study. On the other hand Samvarta 551 (43) affirms that on the days of impurity on birth and death there is no performance of the five Mahāyajñas nor of Veda study. The Nityācāra-paddhati p 544 states that even in hbauca the thousand names of Visnu may be recited. 

Asthisanirayana or Saficayang means that rite in which the (charred) bones (of the cremated person) are collected. This rits is dealt with in many sűtra and smrti works, such as Sān. Sr. IV, 15. 12-18, Sat śr. 28. 3, Āśy.gr. IV, 5 1-18, Gaut P.S I. 5, Visnu Dh, S. 19. 10-1%, Baud P.S I 14, Kausika-sūtra 8%. 29-3%, Vaik. Smārta Sūtra V. 7, Yama 87-88, Saṁvarta 38, Gobbila-smrti II. 54-59 (q. by Hāralatā p. 183). There is great divergence of views about the day on which this was to be done. For example, Sat Sr. 28, 3. 1 provides : 552 'bones are collected on the next day after cremation) or on the 3rd, 5th or 7th.' Samyarta (verse 38) and Garudapurana (Pratakhanda 5 15 ) prescribe that collection of bones should be made on the 1st, 3rd, 7th or 9th and (particularly) on the 4th by twice-born persons The Vāmanapurana (14 97-98) allows it on the 1st, 4th or 7th day. Yama (87) requires the relatives to collect bones from tho 1st to the 4th day after cremation and also provides (verse 88)

that the four yarpas should respectively perform sañcayana on the 4th, 5th, 7th and 9th day. The Aśv. gp, $. IV. 5. 1 states that saflcayana should be performed after the 10th day from oremation in the dark half, but on uneven tithis (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 11th, 13th, 15th) and on a raksałra which bears a name not applicable to two or more naksatras (i. e. except on the two Asadhas, two Phalgunis and two Bhādrapadās). Vispu Dh. S. 19 10, Vaik. Sinārta-sūtra V. 7, Kaus. 82. 29, Visnupurāne ILI, 13 14, Kūrmapurīna (uttara) 23 and a few other works lay down that saīcayand must be done on the 4th day after cromation. The various texts differ a good deal in details. The following is the procedure in the Āśv, gr. IV.5.-The bones of a male should be collected into an urn that has no spacial marks (protuberances), those of a woman in an urn that has protuberances but no other special marks, Åged persons," odd in number 553 not being together with women, (i. 8, not as a mixed assemblage ) collect the bones. The per former walks thrice round the spot (where the body was burnt) with his left side turned towards the spot, sprinkles on it with a sami branch milk mixed with water with a verse esitike' (Rg. X, 16, 14). With the thumb and the 4th finger they (gatherers ) should put each single bone into the urn without making a ratt}ing noise (of the bones in the urn), the bones of the feet being taken first, those of the head last. Having well gathered the bones and having purified them with a win llowing basket (i. e. Temoving the dust attaching to them) they should put the urn in a pit at a place where the waters from different sides do not flow together except rain water with the verse 'upasarpa' (Rg. X 18, 10) and he should throw earth (into the pit) with the following verse (Rg X. 18. 11) After having thrown (earth) he should repeat the next verse (Rg. X, 18, 12). Then covering (the mouth of the urn) with a lid with the mantra 'ut te stabhnāmi' (Rg, X, 18, 13) (he fills up the pit) Thon without looking back they return (towards the house), bathe in water and then offer sraddha to him alono (the departed).

I dissent from him for various reasons; the niost important is that if his theory be correct a period of several conturios must be postulated between the two hymns, This is inadmissible. 

The Kausikasutra (82, 29-32) prescribes certain details differently. It says that the bones are collected with A. V. 18. 2. 84, 26, then they are consigned to a jar over which alj frag rant powders aro scattorod, then the jar is raised with the Utthāpani yorses and carried with the verses called Haridis (ie, A V. 18 % 11-18). He (the performar) deposits (in the earth the urn) at the root of a troo with the verse 'mā tva' (A. V. 18. 2. 25 May the tree not injure thee all round, may not tho wido goddess Earth also injure theo'). 551 

The other sütras present several yariations which are passed over here, excopting one or two matters. The Sat, Sr, proridos that the twig should be of the Udumbara trae, that the bonos aro collected by women of the family of the decaased (his sifo and othora) odd in number (five or more), or other womon (in the absonce of women of the family). A woman who is not likoly to have a child should tie in her left hand a Brhati fruit with two threads, blue and red in colour, should step on a stone with hor left foot, colloct the bones first from the teethiyo or head with the mantra uttistbata' (Tai Ā VI. 4. 2) and she should deposit those bones in a jar or garment, then a second woman of the same type collects bones from the shoulders or arms, a third woman from the sides or hips, a fourth from the thighs or legs, and a fifth from the feet They or mora vomon collect the bones completely, The urn is deposited at the root of a sami or palāsa tree, 

In modern times, particularly in towns and cities, the collection of bones has to be done immediately after cremation. The Antyesti-paddhati closely follows the procedure prescribed in the Ašv. gr quoted above. It eays. the perfornier goes to the place of cremation, sips water, meptions the time and place, makes a sankalpa (declaration) that he will perform the collec

tion of the bones of the departed naming him and his gotra, He walks thrice round the place of cremation with his left towards it and sweeps it with a sami branch and sprinkles it with milk mixed with water with the mantra 'śītike' (Rg X. 16. 14). Then old men odd in number with the performer collect the bones (as stated by Aśy.gr, above) and place them in a new jar and if they are of a woman in a jar with protu berances They also winnow the ashes with a sūrpa and place in the jar even small bones and throw the ashes into the Ganges. Then at some time other than the rainy season a pit should be dug in a pure spot whereon water would not flow and the performer deposits the jar in the pit with the mantra 'approach this mother, Earth' (Rg. X. 18, 10). With Rg X, 18. 11, he throws earth in the pit all round the jar and muimurs with folded hands the mantra (Rg X, 18, 12 ) and he closes the jar with a new earthen disk with the verse Rg. X. 18. 13 Then he should put earth on the jar in such a way that it may not be seen by anybody and without looking back should go else where and bathe, The Nirnayasindhu (p. 586 ) expressly states that the procedure for the collection of bones may be gathered from one's sūtra or from the work of Bhatta (i. o. Nārāyana, Kamalakara's grandfather). 

The Vispudharmagūtra (19.11-12) and Anu, 26.32 state that the collected bones should be cast in Ganges water, since as many particles of the bones of a man remain in Ganges vater for so many thousands of years he dwells in heaven. It was provided in the Purāpas that a virtuous son, brother or daughter's son or a relative on the father's or mother's side should cast the bones in the Ganges, that one not so related should not do it and that if he does it he has to perform cāndrāyapa prāyaścitta. Even in modern times many Hindus take the charred bones of their parents or other dear relatives to the Ganges at Prayaga (Allahabad) or some other holy river 5540 or cast them into the sea. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 587 ) quotes an elaborate rite of casting the ashes in the Ganges from Saunaka.

(Vol. pamoagavya. With the four mantras 'upasarpa' (Rg. X. 18.10-13) he should respectively pray to the earth, then dig it, take out the earth, and then the bones. Then he should bathe and purify the bonos by touching the bones again and again and repeating the mantras .eto nyindram stavāma suddham &c' (Rg VII. 95, 7-9). Then he should bathe with panca. gavya and become pura. Then he should batho ten times with cow's urino, cow's dung, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter, water in which kušas have been dipped, ashes (of sacred fires), earth, honey and water. Then he should sprinkle (with kušas) wator on the bones with the mantras, viz. Rg. 1,2% 16. Rg VIII 95,7-9, 555 Rg VII. 56.12-14, Rg. X. 126 1-8, Rg. X. 119,1-13, Rg. IX. 1.1-10 (called Pāvomāni verses ), Rg. X 128,1-4, Rg. I 43.1-9 (a hymn to Rudra); then he should offer & hiranya Srāddha for the deceased, offor pinda to him and perform tarpxina with sesame. Then he should cover the bones in seven ways viz. by doer-skin, woollen blanket, darbhurs, cow's hair, hempen cloth, birch leaf and palm leaf. He should cast among the bones pieces of gold and silver, pearls, coral and sapphire for the purification of the bones, then he should offer into fire 108 oblations of clarified butter and sesame with the hymn beginn ing with 'udiratām' (Rg. X. 15). Then he should cast the bones in holy water; thereby he does not incur the fault of touching an unclear object. While answering the calls of nature or performing acamana one should not hold the bodes, 

The Nirnayasindhu adds (p. 588) that there is no asthi. sarcayana for one whose upanayana had not been performed. 

The Ašv, gr. IV.6, the Sat Sr. 284, Sān Śr 46 (called parıdhikarma) and some others prescribe a sāntı rite after collection of the charred bones of a deceased person. The Baud. P. S. (II. 3 3) and Visnu Dh. S. 19.19 appear to prescribe the Santi rite after the ten days of impurity have expired('dasarātre saucam krbyā sāntih'). It is described by Aśv. gr as follows: They who have lost a guru (father or mother) by death should perform on the new moon day an expiatory ceremony. Before sunrise they should carry fire together with its ashes and with its receptacle to the south with the half verse "I send away the flesh-devouring Agni' (Rtg X 16 9) Having cast that fre down at a place where four roads meet or somewhere else, they 

555, It should be noticed that in R& VIII 95 7-9 the word suddha' (pure) occurs tbirteen times and bence it is appropriate that those verses are employed as purificatory ones Simularly, ig Rg. VII, 56,12 the word

They should then re turn home without looking back, bathe in water, have their bair, boards and hair on the body and nails cut, furnish themselves with new jars, pots, vessels for ripsing the mouth, with garlands of sami flowers, with fuel of sanıf wood, vith two pieces of sami wood for kindling fire 556 and with branches for encircling the fire, with bull's dung and hide, fresh butter, a stone and as many bunches of kusa grass as there are young women (in the house). At the time of the Agnihotra (in the afternoon, he should kindla fire (by means of the arabis) with, the half verse 'Here may this other Jatavedas' (Rg X. 16,9 latter half)'. Keeping the fire burn ing they sit till night silence falls, repeating tales of old mon (of the family) and stories of auspicious contents, Itzhāsas and Purūnas When all sounds have ceased or when the others (members of the deceased's family) have gone to their houses or Testing place, (the performer) should pour out a continuous stream of pater beginning at the south side of the door with the verge (Rg. X. 53.6) 'spreading the thread follow the light of the world' and go round the house ending at the north side of the door, Thez having placed the fire and spread to the west of it a bull's hide with neck to the east, with the hair outside, he should cause the people of the house (including pomen) to step on that hide with the verse 'Aribe to long life '557 (Rg, X. 18,6). He should place tvigs round the fire with 'Here do I deposit an encircling thing'(Rg. X. 18.4). Having placed a stone to the north of the fire with the words "May they place a mountain between themselves and death' (Rg. X. 18.4 last pāda) and having sacrificed with four verses 'Go hence, O Death' (Rg. X. 18.1*), he should look at his people with the verse 'as days follow each other' (Rg. X 18.5). The young women ( belong ing to the house) should with each hand separately with the thumb and 4th finger salye (at one and the same time) their eyes with fresh butter by means of young darbha blades and cast 

556, Nārāyana explains that the fire means ordinary kitchen fire and be seems to be right in spite of Oldeaberg's pote to the contrary oa p. 246 (of S.

IV. 4) and stoārta fire (if any) and on his death the hotstarma is performed by the son or otber relative bo may have no cod secrated fires at all or, if he bas, he cannot cast them away as long as he lives.

sway the blades turning their faces away. The performer should Jook at them while they are salving their eyes, with the verse 'theso women, being to widows and having good husbands' (Rg. X, 18,7). The former should first touch the stone with the stream containing stones flows' ( Rg. X 538). After that, stationing himself to the north-east, while others go round with the firo, bull-dung and a continuous stream of water he should, aftor repeating the three verses (āpo hi sthā, Rg X, 9.1-3), murmur the Terbe "these have led round the cows' (Rg.

After sunrise, having murmurred the hymns sacred to the sun and auspicious hymns, liaving prepared food and made oblations with the hymn beginning May he burn away evil from us' (Rg. I. 97.1-8), verse by verse, having given to the brāhmanas to eat, he should cause them to pronounce auspicious words. A cow, a cup of metal and a fresh unworn garment are the sacrificial fee for each of the brāhmanas. 

A few details may be added from other sūtras. The Sat Śr, (28.4.1) provides that the Sānti is performed on the 10th day after cremation by a priest, that in the folded hands of the wives ( of the members of the family ) he puts the remains of the material used for oblations syith the verge * these women, not being widows' (Rg, X. 18,7=Tai. Ā, VI, 102), that the priest plants in the earth the stalk of a plant with the yerse' yathā tvom' (Tai, Ā, VI, 10 2 ) 558, that after they return home, they cook goat flesh and boil yava grains and eat them and then may occupy couches and cots (i. e, give up the observances of mourning )

the grave 560 or monument should not be built too soon after desth, lest he (the performer) freshen up the sin of the deceased ; that he should make it a long time after and when paople do not even remember the years (that have elapsed since the decease). He should make it in uneven years and under a single naksatra (i. e. containing a single stat such as Citra and Pusya, and not dnal such as Punarvasu and Visakhā or plural such as Kettikā ) and on the New Moon day. Let bim make it in autumn or in Māgha or in summer. The sepulchral mound should be four cornered, because the people who are worshippers of gods (or godly) make their burial mounds four-cornered, while those who are followers of Asuras, the Easterns and such like people, make them round. As to the choosing of the ground, the Sat. Br. states several views viz. he makes it on ground sloping towards the north or, according to some, to the south; but the Sat, Br, disspproves of both the views and prescribes that he should make the burial mound on any level ground where the waters flowing from a southernly direction come to the east and stand still without dashing forward and on such a ground one may make it (burial mound). Lot him make it on a pleasant and peaceful spot, but not on a road nor in an open space lest he should make the deceased's sin manifest. It should have the sun shining on it (at mid-day).

Ho pakos it on salt (barren) soil, on such ground as abounds in roots. Let him not make it near where grows the Bhūmipāšā plant or where reeds grow, or Ašvagandhā or Adhyanda, or Pršniparnī grows. He should not make it near an asrattha tres or near a vibhitaka tree or a tilvaka, a sphūrjaka or a haridru or nyagrodha tree or other trees that have an eril name (like slesmātaka or koyidāra) For one ho has per formed Agnicayana, he makes a tonb after the manner of the fire altar. One must not make it too large lest he should make the sin (of the deceased) large He should make it just a man's size, broader behind (to the west) and broader on the north side He encloses it with cords twisted in the non-sunwise way. He then bids them to out out the earth which would be just sufficient for making the mound of a man's size. 

The Kāt Śr. (21. 3. 1 and 6) closely follows the above direc tions containod in the Sat 561 Br The Sat.

The Sat. Br. (XII. 8 2-4) pursues the subject of sepulchral monuments as follows: Godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate from the earth; while those trho are of the Asura stamp, the Easterns and others, make the sepulchral mounds so as to be soparate from the earth, either on a stone basin or a similar thing He then oncloses it with an undefined number of stones silently. He then sweeps the Bepul chral site with a palāśa branch with (Vāy S. 35.1 'May the niggardly god-haters go away') and prays that Yama may grant him ( the deceased) an abode He throws out the branch to the south side He then yokes the team of six oxen to the plough on the south side or on the north side, as he chooses Having given the order 'Yoka' he (the performer ) utters the

He then ploughs across the body (of the sepulchral site) silently with an undefined number of furrows He then unfastens the team of oxen To the right side (south-west) be removes this (the plough and the team ). 

He then sows seeds of all kinds of herbs with a single verse (Vā).

He does so before sunrise so that the sun should rise over him while he is doing it He does so with Vāj S. 35. 5-6. He then says to some one 'Proceed in that ( southern ) direction without drawing breath and having thrown down the jar, return hither without looking behind.' He then mutters Vāj $. 35.7. He then arranges the dead man ( the bones ) limb by limb with Vāj. S. 35.8–9. Now thirteen unmarked 563 bricks each measuring a (human) foot (pada) have been made and are laid down

Thereon gods have to be worshipped Here it is the fathers to be bonoured Throughout Sat, Br. XIII 8 2-3 a distinction is drawn between wbat is done for the gods and what is to be done for pitřs in order to keep the divine distinct from what belongs to the fathers In Agnicayana a bird-like pattern is the most frequent (vide H of Db vol II p. 1249) It is hence that the Sat Br. speaks of wings and tails. The heights prescribed for men of the several varnas and for tomen are symbolic Ksatriyas, brābwanas aad vaisyas represent the arms, the month and thighs of the Parasa (as stated in Rg. X. 90.12).

home. They proceed towards the village muttering Vaj. S. 35.14 (ud vayam). When they have arrived, ointments for their eyes and feet are given to them; such indeed are buman means of embellishment and therewith they keep off death from them selses Then in the house having kindled (domestic) fire and laid enclosing sticks of zarana wood round it he offers by means of a sruva ( spoon) an oblation to Agni Ayuşmat. Vaj. S. 35. 16 serves 367 as a puronur ākyā (invitatory formula). He then offers with Vāj. S. 35.17. He says this so that Agni may guard and protect these men. The sacrificial fee is an old ox, old barley, old chair with a head cushion, He may give more if he desires. This is the procedure in the case of one who has performed Agnicayana 568 In the case of him who has not performed Agni. cayapa, there is the same procedure for selecting a site and the same performance says that of the firs-altar Having fetched a clod from the boundary he deposits it midway between the sepulchral mound and the village with Vaj. S. 35. 15 (imam 569 Jivebhyah). He then makes this a boundary between the Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle the two. 

The Sat. Śr. 29. 13 f, and Baud. P.S. I 17–20 provide a lengthy procedure for erecting a mound over the bones of one who has performed the special rite of agnicajana which is passed over here. In building a mound the urn deposited under - a tree is taken out and after the bones are purified in various Ways (such as the spilling on them of curds mixed with vājina from & jar, the digging up of the clods by means of a plough to which & certain number of oxen are yoked). The Sat. Sr. (29. 1. 3-12) deals with one kind of procedure in which there is no dhavana, while 29.1. 13-32 deal with the procedure where dhamana is employed and sūtras from 33 deal with procedure common to both pahsas (viz, one without dharana and the other with dhawna) The building of a mound with clods (lostaciti) in which there is dhavana is rather an obscure matter in its nature and had some symbolic significance which is now lost. It may be briefly described as follows. The members of the deceased's house

That woman roplies to him 'I shall not give (what you ask).' The samo dialogue takes place on the 2nd day. Then on the third day she replies 'I shall give for one night' Or if this peculiar practice (of talking about dhavana, which literally means 'soxual intercourse') was intended to last for more days than three sho was to give a suitable reply (viz. for three nights or for five nights &o). When the words of the reply are uttered by the wifo, the performer deposits the bones (of the deceased) at the root of the peg and places between the three prongs of the peg & jar having a hundred holes at the bottom The mouth of the jat is covered with a hide and kusa grass On that jar he sprinkles curds mixed with vājina with the mantra 'Vaisvānare haviridam' (Tai.

Various measurements are given in the sutras for the mounds that are constructed over the bones, Sat, Śr. (29.1 5-6) says 572 that the site of the mound / $mašūnāyatana ) is five prahramas on all four sides (or six on the east and five in the other directions, acc. to some ). The height of the mound is variously given ayen in the same sūtra. 573 Sat Śr. states that the height way be two finger-breadths, or three or four or a pradeša (the distance between the thunib and index finger when both are stretched away) or a vlast, (twelve finger-breadtha), or it may be up to the knee or thighs or buttocks The Baud P S,T, 18 gives different 574 measurements. It states if the mound to be raisad is as high as the neck towards the west, then it is up to the pavel on the east, if it is as high as the naye) on the west, then it is as high as the knee on the east; if up to the knee on the west them on the east it is level with the ankle'.

255. Stages in the disposal of dead bodies 

modern times. In the Baud. 578 P. S. I 17 there are passages that bear & close resemblance to sonze passages of the Sat. Sr on dhavana. Similarly, Kāt Sr. 579 21. 3,6 provides (immedi ately after the months in which mounds were to be constructed) that as many jars should be taken as there are persons perfoıın ing dhavana (or dhurana) and the conimentator explains that word as meaning 'fanning'. 

It will be seen that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites (called Santıkarma) and erection of a monument over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case. The Andhau Juscription of the time of Rudradaman in the year 52 (probably of the saka era ) refers to the erection of a staff (lasti i e, yasti) as a funeral monument to the inemory of a sister, brother and vife by Madana son of Sibila (vide E I VOI, 16 pp. 23-25). In a long passage of the Brahma purāna quoted by Aparārka (pp. 887-886) it is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and kator, that a puskaraka tree should be planted there or an eduka (a structure ) should be built over it. 580 

The Sat Śr 28.4 28 and Baud P S. II. 3. 2 state as shown above thet the rites immediately after death were performed only up to the depositing of the urn (containing the bones) underground in the case of those housobolders who had not set up tbe vedio fires and in the case of married women and that in the case of him who had performed the solemn rite of Agni cayang & mpound with bricks or clods was built up on the bones.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

It is remarkable that while slaves and even attendants Fere often buried with the aiaster in Babylon and Celtic Britain, there is no similar reference to the burial or cremation of anybody with the deceased even in the ancient procedure found in the Sat Br It is only possible to say that in some cases in the pre-Vedic age the wife might have burnt herself along with the deceased husband on the funeral pyre. There is no doubt that later works like the Visnuidharmasutra recommended to women the practice of Satī as an option to leading the life of perfect celibacy after the husband's death, 

The persons entitled to perform the funeral rites after death (antyakarmadhikarin) are the same as those entitled to offer sraddha. There is a good dea] of difference as to the order of the persons so entitled For example, Gautama (Dh. S 15 13-14) statos 'On failure of sons the sapındas (e g. brother, brother's 5012 ), the sapindas of the mother (eg maternal uncle or his con) and pupils may perform srāddha for the deceased; id default of these the family priest and the ācārya (veda teacher).' Sankha says 582 "The offering of pinda and water should be done by the son for the father; in default (i e absence or death) of the son, the wife of the deceased) should offer, but in default of her the full brotber' The Visnupurāna 532 provides 

the son, grand-son, great grandson (of the deceased), the offspring of the brother (of the deceased), the offspring of a sapinda become entitled to offer (pioda)' The Mārkandeya purāda provides (30. 19-21, chap 27.19-23 of the Veuk, ed.) 'On failure of the sons, sapindas, on failure of them the samānoda kas, then the sapindas of the mother, and samāpodakas of her, should perform these rites, a daughter's son should perform them (If the man dies sonless), the putrikāputra should perform them for bis maternal grand-Father: in default of all these, womeil should perform these rites for their husbands but without Vedic mantras; in default of wife the king should get the rites per formed by some one belonging to the fainily (of the deceased)

OT by persons of his caste, since the king is the relative of all yarnas 583 There was a close connection between taking the estate of a man and performing the rites after death up to the 10th day. For the doctrines represented by the Mitaksarā and the Dāyabhāga, vide H. of Dh. yol II pp. 734-743. Even those that regarded that inheri tance was based on relationship by blood and not on the capacity to offer pindas held that it was obligatory on everyone who took the estate of another (including the king who took as the ultimate heir by escheat) to arrange for the rites after death and śrāddha. Vispu 584 Dh. S. XV. 40 declares 'Whoever inherits the estate of a deceased person has to offer pinda to him.' Yāj. II 127 says the same thing about the Kse raja son (ubhayorapyasau rikthi pinda-dātā ca dharmataḥ). 

· The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 94 ) states the order of adhikarins as fullors; a competent son is the first adhikāri for offering pinda; in default of a son, husband, wife and co-vives; in default of these, the brother's son, the brother, daughter-in-law, daughter, daughter's son, any other sagotra, & sapinda, a fellow-student, a friend, a pupil, the teacher, any relative and anyone who takes the wealth of the deceased may offer pında, The father is not competent to perform śrāddha rites for his (deceased) son, an elder brother for his younger brother; these may even do so through affection but they cannot perform the sapindīkarana, Parents may offer pinda to unmarried daugh ters, and even to married daughters in the absence of another (proper) giver. The daughter's son and the maternal grand father may offer to each other; the daughter's son to waterna) grand-mother; the son-in-law and father-in-law to each other, the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law, brothers among them selves, teacher and pupil to each other.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. vol. II p. 739. The Nirnayasindhu 585 says that in the Kali age only two kinds of sons viz. aurasa and dattaha are allowed (out of the twelve mentioned by Yā]. IL 128-132) and the order of śrāddbadhikārins is given by it as follows: aurasa son, then grandson, then great grandson, then adopted son If there are many sons then the eldest alone is the adhikarin; if the eldest be pot present or is patrta, then the son next to the eldest is the adbikarin (and not the youngest). If the sons are divided from each other, then all the rites up to sapindikarana are to bo performed by the eldest alone who may make the other sons contribute to the expenses, but the yearly śrāddha may ba per formed by each son separately. If the sons (of the deceased) are not divided, then all rites including the yearly śrāddha also are to be performed by the eldest alone When the eldest son not being present, the younger one or the youngest per forms the cremation, he should perform all rites up to and inclu ding the sixteen śrāddhas, but not sapiodikarada and he should wait for one year for the arrival of the eldest If the eldest comes to know of the death within one year, he alone should perform the sapindīkarada, If the eldest son does not come even at the end of one year, then even the youngest may per form sapindīkarana. If before the expiry of one year the youngest son or some one other than & son performs the moothly, anumāsika, sapindikarana śrāddhas, then the eldest son or a son should again perform these. If there is a grandson who has his upadayana performed and there be a son those upanayana is not performed it is the latter who is a preferable adhikarin, provided he is either three years old or has the cūdā ceremony performed as stated by Sumantu 586 Manu IL 172 states that a boy should not repeat the Veda before the performance of Upanayana except the mantras that are te quired for the śrāddha of his deceased father or mother. Such a son may perform with Vedic mantras the funeral rites OD the death of his father or mother and their yearly and other šraddhas. If he is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, be may simply perform the cremation Tith mantras and the rest may be got performed through another person. In the

'sama way he should make only the declaration (sankalpa) of darsaśrāddha and mahālaya and the rest may be performed by sonis one else. An adopted son becomes an adhıkārin for fune Tal rites and the like only if the upanayana has been performed. If there be no lineal descendant up to a great-grandson and also no adopted son, then the wife should perform with mantras the funeral rites and yearly and other śrāddbas but if she is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, then the same rules apply as in the case of an anupanīta son. Even if the husband be not divided from his brother, or be be re-united with his brother, it is the wife and not the brother who is to be preferred as having adhikara for śrāddha, though the brother gets all the property. Though some of the latest works on dharmaśāstra like the Nirnayasindhu 587 and Dharmasındhu (bhāryayapi samantrakam-eya-aurdhradehikadikam kāryam) allowed the wife to perform rites after death with vedic mantras, several works such as the Mārkandeya-purāna and the Brahmapurada did not allow the wife to repeat Vedic mantras (vide note 583 above). In default of the wife, the daughter has the right to perform rites after death if the deceased was separated and not re-united. But if the deceased was joint then his full brother would be the proper adhikarin after the wife. Among daughters the married one is preferred, though an unmarrjed daughter is a preferable heir. In default of daughters, the daughter's son is an adhikarin; then a brother, then a brcther's son. Among brothers a full brother is preferred to a half brother and if there be both elder and younger brothers, then the younger is preferred for performing rites after death (in order to make as near an approach as possible to the relation of father and son). If there be no younger brother, then even an elder one could be adhikārin; in default of full brother, a half brother. Some held that even if the deceased was separata from his brother and had a daughter or daughter's son as heir the funeral rites were to be performed by the brother (and not by the daughter or her son), since & sagotra is to be preferred as an adhikarin to one of a different gotra. If there be no brother, then a full brother's son was to be preferred, then the half brother's son, then father, then mother, then daughter-in-law, then sister. In case of there being

full sisters, half sisters, younger and older sisters the same rules apply as in the case of brothers; in default of any sister, sister's SON. If there be many sister's sons, the rules as to brothers would apply. Then come paternal uncle, his son, other sapindas; 588 then samānodakas, then other persons born in the same family. In default of these, the sapipdas of the mother, such as the maternal grand-father, maternal uncle, maternal uncle's son is that order; in default of the sapindag of the mother, the sons of the deceased's paternal or maternal aunt; in default of these the prir-bandhus such as the sons of the father's father's sister, of the father's mother's sister, of father's maternal uncle; then the maātr-bandhus such as mother's father's sisters's son; in default of these, a disciple (of the deceased); in default of disciple, son-in-law of the deceased (or the father in-law of the deceased); in default of these, a friend; in default, any one who takes the wealth of a brābmana (deceased); if the deceased was other than a brābmana the king (who took the wealth of everyone dying heirless, except the wealth of a brahmana) who arranges for funeral rites through another. 

In the case of women the following order of those entitled to perform rites of a deceased woman is given in the Dharma sindhu (p. 370); If the female be unmarried then her father is the adhikarin, then her brother and the like; if the woman was married, her son, then her co-wife's son, then co-wife's grandson and then great-grandson; in default of these, the husband; in default of husband, daughter, then daughter's son; then busband's brother; then husband's brother's son; then daughter-in-last; then (the deceased) woman's father, then her brother; then her brother's son and the rest. 

An adopted son should perform the śrāddha of his natural father if the latter left zo son or other adbikārl If a brahms cārin dies, his monthly, yearly and other sraddhas should be performed by his father and mother. A brahmacārın may carry the dead body of his parents, or of his maternal grand-father, upādhyāya and ācārya and perform the cromation and other rites; but if another adhikārin is available, he should not do these even for the parents and the other threo.

should zot at all carry the dead body of any one except of the above five or perform the cremation and other rites for any one 8]se. If a brahmacārin performed all the rites for ten days he had to observe āśauca for ten days, but if he performed only the cremation he had to observe āśauca only for one day. Even while in mourning his obligatory acts do not stop; but he should not eat the food cooked for bis relatives that are in mourning nor should be dwell among them; if he did (both these ) he had to undergo prāyaścitta and perform upanayana again, 

It is somewhat curious that Baudhāyana, the Lingapurada (quoted in Srāddhaprakāśa pp. 361-371), the Markandeya. purāna, the Pitrdayitā (p 82) and several other works allow man himself while living to perform his own rites after death (antyesti).589 This will be dealt with briefly later on under śrāddha Further, if a man became patrta and refused to undergo prāyaścitta, he was driven out of the Hindu fold by the pro cedure of ghatasphota (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 387-388), and Gaut. Dh, S. 20 % and Manu XI. 182-183 provide that such a man was to be held to be dead and his relatives were to perform a]l rites for him such as offering water and srāddha and were also to obserye āśauca for him.590 

Many commentators and digests quote certain verses of the Vispupurāpa (III, 13. 34-39) wherein the rites (kriyah) after death performed for a person are enumerated as falling into three classes, viz. pūrva, madhyama and uttara. The rites from cremation up to the end of the 12th day are called pürya, the śrāddhas performed monthly and sapindikarana and ekoddista are called madhyama rites and those that are performed after sapindīkarada, when the deceased has reached the position of pity after being a preta, are designated uttara,591 The pūrva and

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. madhyama rites of the deceased may be performed by the father, the mother, sapindas, samānodakas and those belonging to the deceased's group (gotra) or by the king if le takes the wealth of the deceased. But the rites called uttara are to be performed only by the son, grandson, great-grandson, daughter's son or the latter's sons Even in the case of women, on the day of the anniversary of death every year an ekoddista srāddha may be performed for them. There is also another classification of śrāddhas viz. Navašrāddha (those rites up to ten days after death), Navamišra (those performed after ten days up to six seasons), Purana (those perfornied after a year ).591a 

As stated above, for ten days after death a bandful of water mixed with sesame was to be offered to the deceased on a stone (ašman) placed on kuģa grass and one large pinda (called pūraka-pipda) was to be offered on busa grags everyday with the face to the south and the sacred thread on the right shoulder (prācidāpiti) for the purpose of freeing tho departed from the state of being a preta. On the pinda, yator mixed with sesame was to be offered and leaves of Bhragarāja (called mākā in Marathi) and Tulasi also. The verse 'anādi. nidhano' was to be repeated 592. The performer throws the pinda in water and then bathes. Vide A.K. D pp. 43-50 and Antyesti-paddhati of Nārāyana for detailed treatment of the procedure of these ten days. Besides this, the Asvalayana grhyaparisistass IIL 6 speaks of five sraddhas called 'nava

šraddhas' (or Visamaśrāddhas) performed on the uneven days (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th ) with uncooked food. According to the Garudapurada (Pretakhanda 34, 36 which speaks of six śrāddhas on uneven days from 1st day to 11th) and Apastamba they are six (Dharmasindhu p 464, Nirdayasindhu p 588, Suddhiprakāśa pp. 214-216, Srāddhatattva p. 619) and accord ing to others there is an option. Angiras and Vasistha speak of six Navasrāddhas on uneven days from the 1st to the 11th, while Baud Pitrmedha S. IL 10, 6 speaks of five. Some prescribe the placing of some cooked food sprinkled with ghee on the hand of a brāhmana. Others do not approve of this They prescribe the placing of uncooked corn in front of a brāk mapa or in front of a figure of a brābmaņa made with kušas (called cata in Marathi). The Garudapurāpa (IL. 5, 67 ff) holds that the payasrāddhas are those performed at the place where 

man died, where the funeral procession rested on the way, when the bones were collected and those performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th day, The Suddhiprakās3 p. 214 quotes similar views from Katyāyana and the view of Viddha-Vasistha that the deceased does not become free from the status of a preta, unless the navafrāddhas are performed. The Garudapurāna, Pretakhanda (chap. 34. 27-28, 44, 48) states that by the pindas offered for ten days the several limbs of a subtlo body are provided for the departed spirit which at first wanders like thin air. There are several differing views on tho napaśrāddbas which are passed over here. On the uneven days if navašrāddha is performed two pindas will be offered (one the daily one and the other, of the Dayaśrāddha). The Padma (Srstikhanda 10. 19) prescribes that one should not pat take of the food at navasraddha and on doing so should undergo the cāndrāyada expiation. 

In modern times, after the rites of the first day of crema tion and of the collection of the bones, the rites for the dead generally begin on the 10th day. The performer goes to the place where the rites of the first day were performed, makes a sankalpa and offers a pinda with the words "May this pinda wait upon the preta Damed N. N, and of the gotra (Kāśyapa &o ) in order that hunger and thirst affecting the preta may be removed'. Theo he offers water mixed with sesame, places leares of blrngarāja and tulasī, repeats the verge 'anādini dbano' (nota 592), removes the pinda to another place from the place where it was offered.

Then he offers a request to the middle jar with the words 'May this pinda together with the jar of water wait upon the preta by name N, N, of such and such a gotra in order that his hunger and thirst may be allayed'.

Ethereal body after death 

265 

Some of the Puranas and medieval digests assert that after a man dies, the soul or spirit assumes that is called an ativahika sin body consisting of three of the five elements (vir. fire, vind and akāśa) that rise up from the dead body (while two viz, earth and water remain below), that such a body is obtained only by men and not by other beings, that with the aid of the pindas that are offered to the departed at the time of cremation and during ten days thereafter, the soul secures another body called bhogadeha (a body for enjoying the pindas offered) and that at the end of a year when sapındıkarana is performed, the soul securos a third body wherewith the spirit reaches heaven or bell according to the nature of his actions, The word 'ativāhika' is comparatively an ancient one. It occurs in Vedantasutra IV. 3.4 (ativahikas-tal-lingat). But there the meaning is somewhat different. The Upanisads speak of the soul as going by the path of arcas, day &c. The sutra says that these (viz. ar cis, ahah &c.) are superintending deities that take the soul gradually opward by the path that leads to Brahma. Govindānanda in his commentary on the Prāgaścitta viveka (pp. 13-14) holds that there are only two bodies (and not three as appears at first sight), viz, the ātrvāhika or pretadeha and the blogadeha. The belief was that the man on whose death Do pioda was offered or the sixteen śrāddhas (to be described below) vere not performed remained for all time in the condi

(VOL. tion of a pisaca, from which he would not be freed upon if numerous other śrāddhas were later on offered for him, 595 The Brahmapurāna calls the body 'yātaniya'(i.e, one that has to undergo trials and torments), while the Agnipurāpa calls it 

yātāniya' or 'ativāhika' and asserts that this body is made up of the elements of ākāśa, vāyu and tegas The Padmapurāna (IL 67, 98 ) states that persons who commit certain sins secure after death a body similar in shape to the physical body for undergoing torments. The underlying conception was that when the gross body was destroyed after death by cremation, burial or other methods an intermediate subtile body had to be built up before the departed soul was compelled to assume another body in a fresh incarnation The subtile body was gradu ally built up, as stated by the Mārk 10.73, by the rites performed on death and on several days after death. Though this con ception is very clearly set forth in the Purānas it should not be supposed that it was altogether a new one. It had its roots deep down in the earliest Vedic period and was implioit in some of the hymns as indicated by Rg. X, 15. 14, X. 16, 4-5 translated above. Though in the Tai. S. I 8.5 1-2 and in passages of the Tai, Br, and Sat. Br to be set out later on it is said that the offerings are made to the paternal ancestors, it does not follow that the brāhmanas were not fed at the same time on the food prepared for being offered to the ancestors, just as in the solemn Vedic sacrifices offerings were made to the gods, Agni, Indra, Prajāpati, Visou and others and at the same time priests engaged in the sacrifices were fed and given presents ( dalsına). Therefore, it need not be necessarily sup posed that feeding the brahmanas at sraddha vas & later idea and offering food to the dead was the origina] idea.

SUDDHI 

includ and death) e 

or on acopisc., after threet under é 

Suddhi (purification ) is a very comprehensive topic including within it purification after āśauca (impurity on birth and death), purification of a person after contact with an impure object or on account of certain occurrences, purification of pots, wells, food &c., after they are polluted. Āśauca, however, is the most important subject under śuddhi and therefore the Suddhi kaumudi defines "suddhi' as 'the state of being fit for or capable of performing the rites that are understood from the Veda 596 The Surtis employ the word suddhi in relation to purification after āśauca. For example, Manu V, 57 starts by saying that he will expound purification after a man is dead (pretasuddhi) and purification of things (dravyasuddhi). Manu V, 83 ( = Daksa VI, 7) avers that a brahmana becomes pure after ten days (on the death or birth of a relative ), a ksatriya after twelve &o, The Parāśara-smrti starts chapter three by declaring 'I shall expound suddhi on birth and death.' Yaj. III, 14, 25 also employ the word suddhi. Therefore aśauca on birth and death will be first dealt with. 

The word āśauca is formed from suci (pure) according to Pāp. V. 1.131 596a and Pān. VII. 3. 30 (vide note below) with the negative particle na (a). In some smrtis such as that of Devala the form āśucya' also is found (soe Hāralatā pp. 2, 9, 36 in quotations from Devala 5968). Another word which is often used as a synonym for āśauca is 'agha'. It has been seen above (p.6) that the word agha means 'sin' in the Vedic Literature (as in Rg. I. 97. 1-8, X, 117.6). But in the San, Śr. IV, 15. 11,

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. Manu v. 84 (na vardhayed-aghahāni) the word 'agha' has come to mean the same thing as āśauca. 597 The Padmapurāna II. 66. 73-74 states that since the outlets of the body always einit muous, urine &c, it is always impuro, 

The Mit, on Yāj. III 1 defines 59s āšauca as an emergent attribute attaching to a person, which is got rid of by lapso of time or a bath and the like and which is the cause of the positive direction to offer (to a deceased person) pinda, water and the like and of the cessation of Vedic study and other actions The Mit adds that āśauca is not merely the absence of the privilege or power to do religious acts, since even those who have incurred impurity (on death &c ) are enjoined to do certain religious acts such as offering water ( to the deceased) This definition of the Mit appears to be an echo of the Garuda purana (pretakhanda) 5.9 and is probably based on a verse of the work called Sangraha. Haradatta 599 on Gautama 14. 1 states that aśauca may be defined as 'the absence of the privilege to perform religious acts, unfitness for baing ono whose food may be partaken of, untouchability and the loss of the privilege to make religious gifts.' A comparatively early writer Bhattācārya, 600 appears to have defined 'śuddhi' as the "removal of sin' or as 'being fit for performing religious acts.' This was accepted by the Sporti-candrika, but rejected by Nandapandita, commentator of Sadasiti (pp. 2-3) Even tho Mit. (on Yaj, III. 18) emphasizes that asauca has two characteristics, viz, it takes away the privilege of performing 

of the work asauca mascious acts, uhability and the costis

religious acts and it renders a person untouchable. The Smrtimuktāphala follows this. Rudradhara in his Suddhiviveka (D. O ns, No. 309 of 1887-91 folio 1 ) says that suddhi is a special attribute which brings about a capacity or privilege for the performance of a}} dharmas, while aśuddbi is an attribute opposed to suddhi-and arises on the occasion of the birth of a sapinda or the like. 602 

Ašauca is of two kinds, viz. that arising on birth 602 (and 80 called jananāsauca or sutaka) and that arising on death (and therefore called šārāśauca or motakāśauca or maranāśauca). šāva is derived from sava (meaning a corpse). The word sūtaka occurs in the 603 Ait. Br. (chap. 32.8) and is there probably used in the sense of impurity on both birth and death, There it is said that if an āhitāgni partook of food from the house of him who was affected by sütaka, then the prāyaścitta was to offer a purodāsa cooked on eight potsherds to Agni Tantunat. Tantu means also 'son or progeny' and so it may ba argued that it is an indication that sūtaka is used in the Ait. Br. in the sense of impurity on birth. The word sūtaka is used in the smrtis in thres senses: (1) impurity on birth (vide Manu V.58); (2) impurity both on birth and death, as in Gobhilasmrti III:63 and 63; 604 (3) impurity on death alone (as in Daksa VI, 1 and Gobhilasmrtı III. 48) 605 In some of the modern vernaculars (such as Marathi) the word 'sūtaka' is used in the 3rd sense alone. In each of these two divisions there are two varieties viz, where the duration is brief or com paratively long (Şadašiti, verse 2). 

A question arises why birth and death should cause in. purity to the members of the family or to relatives. Only a

few have to say anything on this question, Harlta says: 'the family incurs death impurity because by death the family faels overwhelmed (or frustrated), while when a new life appears the family increases (and there is gratification or joy)' 505, 

The literature on Suddhi (including aśauca) is very exten sive. Apart from the sútras, smrtis and Purānas there are numerous digests dealing with the subject at great length. Some of them have been printed. The smrtis contain a mass of contradictory dicta to such an extant and different from the Usages of medieral times that the Mit on Yāj II. 22 after quoting the views of Parāśara, Sātātapa, Vasistha and Angiras on the periods for Thich impurity had to be observed by per sons belonging to the four Farnas refuses to evolve order out of then and remarks that the asages in its day were diffe rent from the dicta of those sages 607. The Madana-pārijāta (p 392) agrees with the Mit and also suggests other modes of dealing with the conflict. To examples may be cited of the way in which different smrtis approach the same problem, Atri 83, Parāśara III 5 and Daksa VI. 6 provide that a brāhmada who has congecrated the three Vedic fires and bas mastered the Veda becomes free from impurity (on birth and death) in one day, one who has merely mastered the Veda ( but has not consecrated the srauta fires) in three days and one who is devoid of both in ten dars. Manu v.59 gires various options viz 10 days, 4 days, 3 days, 1 day but does not state explicitly to whom his remarks apply. Brhaspatiala.

Conflict of smrtis on asauca 

by Hāralatā p. 5 and Haradatta on Gautana 14. 1) states that a brahmana who is endoged with Veda and śrauta fires becomes pure after three days, one who is devoid of srauta fires ( but is master of the Veda) in five days and one who is only a brahmana by caste (has not studied the Veda or does not teach it) in ten days. The San Sr. and Manu 608 (both quoted above) urge a man not to increase through laziness the qumber of days for which impurity is to be observed. It is possible that persons claiming to be learned observed impurity for a few days only, while neighbours disputed their claim to this special dispensation in favour of Vedic learning and keeping śrauta fires. The result was that later on a flat pumber of ten days was prescribed for all biāhmaṇas whether learned or not and the provision for losser number of days of impurity was relegated to Kalvariya usages. Vide H, of Dh. vol. III, pp. 941-42.

Another example of the dependence of the days of impurity on the caste of the deceased and of varying dicta thereon may be cited, Manu V. 83, Daksa VI 7, Yāj III, 22, Atri (verse 85), Sankha (15.2-3), Matsyapurāna (18. 2-3), Brahmapurapa 220. 63, Visnu Dh, S 22. 1-4, all lay down periods of 10 days, 12 days, 15 days and a month for impurity among brāhmadas, ksatriyas, vaišyas and sūdras respectively. Yaj. III, 22 makes the virtuous šūdra observe impurity only for 15 days as a concession, Gaut. (15.1-4) prescribas 10, 11, 12 days (or half month) and a month respectively for the four vargas, while Vas. (4.27-30) gives the periods of 10, 15, 20 and one month for the four varnas. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar, in his article on Nāgara brāhmavas and Kayasthas of Bengal, protests that the Kayasthas of Bengal (owing to social tyranny) sti]] obserye āśauca for one month as if they are ordinary śūdras (I. A. for 1932 at P.71), On the other hand, Angiras ( quoted by the Mit. on Yaj. 11. 22) states that śātātapa declared that all varnas become purified after ten days whether the impurity is due to birth or death,609 Parāśara (III, 9) quoted by the Mit. on Yāj.

provides that a sapinda who is 4th in descent from the cominon ancestor of the deceased and himself becomes pure after ten days, one who is 5th after 6 days, one who is 6th in descent after four days and one who is 7th after one day. The Mita says that this should be discarded as it is in conflict with many other smortis and is disapproved of by people, 610 Some of the rules mentioned by Vijñanesvara (about 1100 AD) themselves underwent changes in 500 years as noted by the Nirdayasindhu (composed in 1612 A. D. 611). 

The Mit. on Yāj III, 18 declares that when a child that has not conipleted two years dies, it is the parents that have to observe aśauca for ten days and not all sapipdas and that their aśauca entails untouchability for them. The Nirdayasindhu (p. 517) remarks that what Vijñāneśyara said is not nov (in its time) the usage and that the Surtyarthasāra also did not accept Vijñānośyara's view. 

In view of the above-mentioned circumstances no useful purpose would be served by setting out in detail the varying diota of the smrtis, Puranas 612 and the digests upon the several matters that fall to be treated under ašauca, Digests on this subject are too numerous to mention. The following printed ones and a few miss have been made use of in preparing the following account. In the first place, there are several works that deal with this subject in verse. The Asaucāstaka aftri buted to Vararuci (published in the Trivandrum series) with &

commentary by an anonymous writer that names the bhāsya of Maskarin on Gautama-dharmasūtra (on p. 35) deals with the subject in eight sragdharā verses. The Aśaucadaśaka or Dašašlokī attributed to Vijñānešvara seems to have been a very popular work. There are several commentaries on it. The ons by Harihara is the earliest of them. In the Deccan College collection of Mss (now at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona) there are several Mss of it, two of which were copied in sainvat 1539 (D. C. No. 216 of 1879-80) and sarvat 1579 (D.O.No 196 of 1884-87) and which expressly state that the work was composed by Vijñāneśvara-yogIndra, The ton Śārdüla vikridita verses of the Asaucadaśaka are set out in the appendix. The Kalpataru of Laksmidhara has a section on śuddhi which has been recently published in the G.O.S. The Hāralatā of Aniruddha is very useful (B. I Series). The Āśaucakānda of the Smrticandrikā has been edited by the lata Dr. Shamsastry and published as No. 56 of the Mysore University Sanskrit publica tions, The Trimsacchloki with the commentary of Raghunatha composed in sake 1645 has been published at the Poona Ananda śrama press and contains 30 Sragdharā verses on āśauca. The Şadasiti (86 verses in the Apustubh metre ) of Kausikāditya with the commentary Suddhicandrikā by Vināyaka alias Nanda pandita (composed about 1600 A. D.) has been published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The Suddhikaumudi of Govinda nanda (B. L Series ); the Suddhitattva of Raghunandana (ed. by Jivananda pp. 233-412), the Suddhiprakasa (part of the Viramitrodaya of Mitramiśra ) published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series, the Suddhimayūkha of Nilakantha ( edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) and the Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanatha (edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) are compilations that are useful in their own way. These exhaustive treatises on āšauca show one thing unmistakably that brāhmanas of the medieval ages attached an extremely exaggerated importance to ceremonial purity of tbe body on birth and death. 

The periods of impurity depended on many circumstances, There was a difference between impurity on birth and that on death; so also the duration depended upon whether the deceased was an infant or a male or a female or one whose upanayang had been performed or not performed; it depended on oaste and also on the question whether the deceased died near the relative or far away; also upon the degree of relationship; and on the time that elapsed from the birth or death till it reached the ears'

of the relative. The intensity of impurity was different in each of the following: a sütikā (a freshly delivered woman), rajasvalā (woman in montbly illness ), impurity od death, impurity on birth (the last being the least ). 

Daksa (VI 2-3) states that there are ten varieties in impurity, viz. immediate purity (after taking a bath ), one day, three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fort. night, a month and till the end of one's life 613 Daksa then explains in what cases these different periods apply. As to what is meant by impurity till life's end (lit till he is reduced to ashes), Daksa ( VI 8–10 ) says. 'those who take their meala without bathing or offering to gods or without making gifts all such persons are in impurity till life ends. One who is permanently aftlicted with a disease, who is close-fisted (1.0, stints himself, wife and son and religious acts through greed), who is always in debt (1, e. who has not paid off his debts to gods, sages and manes), who is bereft of religious acts (nitya or namitzka ), who is a fool and is under the thumb of his wife, whose mind is bent on vices (gambling, prostitution &c ), who is always dependent (a king's servant or the like ), who is devoid of faith and benevolence (charitable gifts )--he incurs impurity which ends only with his ashes (i e, only when he is cremated). 614 These words are not to be taken literally; What is meant is that such a man is to be shunned by others (i s it is an arthavāda correying merely censure) 

We shall now turn to the impurity on birth. 

That the impurity on birth lasted for ten days even in Vedic times can be inferred from the story of Sunah-sep8 narrated in the Ait Br (chapter 33 %), where occurs the passage when the animal is more than ten days from birth he becomes pure (and fit to be offered in sacrifice)* The same

Impurity on birth 

inference can probably be drawn from Tai. Br. I, 1 1.3, where it is said 'therefore people do not take the milk of a cow for ten nights when a calf is born.' 635 

Abortion in the first four months 616 of pregnancy is called srāva, abortion in the 5th or 6th month is called pata and from the 7th month of pregnancy onwards it is called prasütz or prasaia (according to Parāśara IL 16, Sadašiti verse 9). When there is srāva the mother incurs impurity for three days, in the case of pāta the mother has to observe impurity for as many days as correspond to the months of pregnancy (i, e, 5 days or 6 days). The impurity consists in the mother being untouchable. The father alone has to bathe when there is stāva, but when there is pāla the father and sapindas have to observe impurity for three days ( according to Madana-pārijāta p. 380-381 and others) but they don't incur impurity as on death. These rules hold good for all castes. But when the foetus comes out dead in any month from the 7th or the child is still-born, then the impurity is for tan days for both parents and the sapindas for all varnas or for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varpas as laid down in Yāj. (III. 22 ) and the samānodakas have to obserye aśauca for three days and sagotras for one day (Dharmasindhu p. 427). The above rules are more or less laid down by Gautama 14. 15–16, Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 136, Parāśara II, 24, Manu V. 66, Yāj. II. 20 (latter half) and the first verse of Aśaucadaśaka. The mother is untouchable for ten days on .birth, still-birth or abortion in 7th, 8th or 9th month but the father and sapindas 617 when they take a bath after the prasava are not untouchable ( Yaj. III, 19 ). In ancient times there were several differing vievs about jananāsauca for the father as vouched for by Baud,618 Dh. S. I 5 125–128. Although a woman

Even when sagotras have to observe aśauca on birth they are not untouchable (Şadasiti Verse 6 ). 

It would be better to state here certain general rules once for all. When any text employs the word day (ahah) or night (ratra) in prescribing the duration of āśauca what is meant is ahorūtia (both day 622 and night). When counting the days of aśauca one has to begin from the day of the cremation, if the deceased was an āhetāgnz, but from the day of death in the case of one not an āhtāgnz 623 (Āśauca-dasaka verse 4, Kūrma, Uttarardha 23.52). Birth and death are causes of asauca only when they are known to the person who is to be affected by it and dot by the mere fact of the birth or death. This follows from certain

General rules about asauca

passages of Pāraskara gr. III. 10 and Manu V. 75-76 and the Brahmapurāna, Pāraskara (III. 10) provides : 624 'if one who had gone abroad dies, (his relatives) should on hearing (of his death) sit down and offer him water and should remain untouchable for the days that remain out of the proper period (viz. 10, 1%, 15, 30 days); if the prescribed period (of āśauca ) has expired they should observe asauca for one night or three nights,' Manu (V. 75-76) is to the same effect, The Brahmapurana states : 'if a donor makes & gift and the acceptor accepts it when both are pot aware of there being a birth or death in their family, no blame attaches.' 

We should now turn to āšauca on death. Here again there is no unanimity and therefore the views perferably of the latest works (such as the Dharmasindhu) will be set out after referring to a few smrti passages, Āsauca on death randers those who jncur it untouchable and unable to perform religious rites. Pār. gr. III. 10. 29-30 (S. B. E. YO), 29 p. 357) statad gene rally that the impurity caused by death lasts through thres nights and that according to some teachers through ten nights, If a child dies within ten days of birth, the father and mother have to obserye Jananāsauca and become purified by the end of the āśauca on birth and the father remains untouchable for those days (Kūrma-purāna q. by S. K. p 21). If a child died before it struck teath the sapndas had only to undergo a bath, while the parents had to observe aśauca for three days if the child was a son and for one day if a daughter (vide Yāj. II. 23, Sankha 15, 4, Atri 95, Ašaucadaśaka verse 2). If the child died after striking teeth but before Cūda (or the end of the third year) the sapindas had to observe āśauca for one day and night (Yāj, IL 23, Sankha 15, 5), but the parents had āsauca (of death) for three days. If the child was & girl the sapindas became pure by & bath up to the girl's third year. If death occurs between Cūdā (or three years ) and ilpanayana or marriage (in the case of girls) the sapipdas including the father have to observe āśauca for three days and samāpodakas become purified by a bath alone After upa nayapa all sapindas have to observe āśauca (on death) for ten days (Gaut. 14 1, Manu V. 59, Asaucadašaka 2) and all samānodakas for three days. In the case of a šūdra dying

(Voi. 

after three and before marriage or 16 years the ašauca is three days for all sapindas. After sixteen years or marriage (in the case of a sudra) it is the āśauca prescribed for his caste, In the case of a girl dying after three years and before vāgdāna (betrothal) the parents have asauca for three days and the sapindas ( up to three generations) one day. If a girl dies after vāgdāna and before marriage the sapindas of her father as well as of the proposed bridegroom had to obserye āšauta for three days. In the case of women and gūdras if death takes place after marriage or after 16 years (if the Sūdra was unmarried) the period of āśauca for all sapindas is ten days. If a woman dies at her father's house after marriage, her parents, step-mother, full brothers and step-brothers liave to observe āśauca for three days and her paternal unole and the like that stay in the same house with her father for one day. Some say that if the married daughter dies in a village other than that of the father, the parents have to observe āśauca for a paksini 625 (1. e, two nights with a day between or two days with a night between). There are other views on this point which are passed over. For example, Visdu-dharmagūtra (22. 32-34) says that in the case of a married woman there is no āśauca on the parents' side; but when she is delivered of a child or dies in the father's house then the impurity is for one day or three days respectively. 626 A married woman has to observe asauca for three days for the death of her parents or step-mother if ten days have not elapsed from the day of death or for the remaining days out of the period of ten (Yā). III. 21 latter half). If the married daughter hears of the death of the parents or step-mother at a time more than ten days after the death or within one year she has to observe āśauca for a paksid), If a brother whose upadsyana has been performed dies at his married sister's house or vice versa, aśauca has to Le observed for three days by them, but it they do not die at each other's house but in a different one

Rules about asauca on death 

then the ašauca is for & paksins and if the death occurs in another village then there is aśauca only for one day. The same rules apply to step-brothers and step-sisters and also among sisters. A married woman on the death of her paternal grand-father or paternal uncle kas to undergo only a bath. If a maternal uncle dies, the nephew and the piece have to observe aśauca for a paksini. If the maternal uncle dies in the house of the nephev then there is āśauca for three days and for only one day if the maternal uncle had not his upanayana performed or died in another village; the same rules apply to one's mother's step-brother. If the wife of a maternal uncle dies, the nephew of the niece of the maternal uncle have to undergo āśauca for a paksini If a nephew whose thread ceremony bas been performed dies, his maternal uncle and maternal aunt have āšauca for three days The same rules apply if the deceased be the son of a step-sister of the maternal uncle. If the niece (sister's daughter) dies there is only a bath for the maternal uncle. If a maternal grandfather dies, the grandchild (the son or daughter of a daughter) has to observe asauca for three days, but only for a paksini if the maternal grandfather dies in a different village. On the death of the maternal grand mother the grandchildren have to observe āśauca for a paksini, Some works do not prescribe āśauca for a female descendant such as a niece or grand-daughter. If a daughter's son, whose upanayana had been performed, died, the maternal grandfather and grandmother had to observe āśauca for three days and for paksipi if the daughter's son had not upanayana performed for him. On the death of a daughter's daughter the maternal grandfather and mother incur no āśauca In all these matters tha general rule is that a male whose upanayana had been performed and a married woman alone are liable to undergo āśauca for any relative other than the parents (i e, on the death of a parent a 'male though without upanayana and a roman though unmarried are liable to undergo āśauca). 

If a man's father-in-law or mother-in-law die near (in the house of) the man, he has to undergo āśavca for three days, but op]y for paksind if the death is elsewhere than with the son-in lar. On the death of & son-in-law, the father-in-law and the mother-in-law have to observe āšauca for one day or they have only to take a bath, but if the son-in-law dies in the house of the father-in-law then the āśauca is for three days. On the death of one's wife's brother, the asauca is for one day i

upanayana had been performed; but if no upanayana was performed or if he died in another village a mere bath is enough, 

On the death of one's mother's sisters (full or half ) the person (whether man or woman) has to undergo aśauca for a paksini; the same rule applies on the death of the father's sister. If it is a step-sister of the father then a mere bath 19 enough. The father's sister has to undergo a bath if the nephew dies If one's father's sister or mother's sister dies in one's house then the aśauca is for three days. 

In the case of "bandhus (described by the Mit. on Yaj. II. 135 as bhinnagotra sapindas) of 627 the three kinds, the ašauca is for a paksidl, provided the bandhu is upanita but if he died before upanayana then āšauca is for one day and if the bandbu died in one's house then for three days If the daughter of the father's sister (and of the other bandhus enu merated in the three verses) dies married, the asauca is one day, but if they die unmarried only a bath is necessary. Among the three kinds of babdhus, a man himself and his three atmabandhus have to observe āśauca for each other's death; but the case is different as to potrbandhus and mātou bandhus. If any one of these latter dies, there is āśauca for the man whose bandhus they are, but if a man dies, h78 pitr bandhus and nātrbandhus have to observe no āšauca. 

If an adopted son dies, his natural father and adoptive father have to observe āśauca for three days (the Vyavahāra mayúkha differs from this ) and the sapindas for one day. 

If the adoptive or natural father dies, the adopted son has to observe āśauca for three days and for one day for the sapindas of any one of them. On the death of the son and the grandson of an adopted son, the sapindas of the natural father and the adoptive father bave to observe āśauca for one day and

vice versa. These rules apply if the son adopted is not a sapinda or samanodaka of the adopter, when he was in his family of birth. But if a Bagotra sapinda or a samanodaka be adopted, then the āśauca is for ten or three days respectively.

If one's ācārya 628 dies, the pupil has to observe āśauca for three days, but only one day if he dies in another village (Gautama 14. 26, 5%, Manu V. 80). On the death of the acārya's Wife or son the asauca is for one day. 629 On the death of a guru (who instructs in Vedic mantras) the āśauca is three days and paksini if he dies in another village. On the death of a teacher who imparted instruction in grammar, astronomy and other angas (subsidiary lores) of the Veda, the asauca is one day. Similar rules are laid down about the death of a pupil, riurk (sacrificial priest), a sacrificer, a dependent šrotriya, a fellow-student, a friend, which are all passed over as not now useful Vide Gaut, 14, 19-20 (which prescribe one day's āśauca on the death of a fellow-student or a dependent grotriya). 

These provisions about aśauca on the death of the acārya and rtvik who were not sapindas show how closely the bond between teacher and pupil was thought to be in ancient times, almost equalling the tie of blood. When a yati (ascetic) dios, 630 all his sapindas have simply to undergo a bath (and nothing more). Conversely, a yati and brahmacārin have to observe no āšauca Manu V. 8%, Yāj III. 25, Visnu 22.45, Sankha 15. 15 provide that on the death of the ruler of the country in which one resides one has to observe āšauca up till 

628. An acārya is defined by Manu II. 140 as one who performs the upadayada of his pupil and teaches him the Veda together with the Kalpasūtra and Vpadisads, Rtvik is defined by Manu II. 143 as one who is chosen for the performance of Agayādbeya, the pākayajñas and the soleme sacrifices like Agaistoma.

As long as a corpse is not removed from the village in which a man dies, the wbole village is in āśauca Āp Dh, S. 1 3 9 14 declares that there is no Veda study till a corpse lies in the village The Sinrti-muktāphala (p 541 ) quotes 632 several smrtis to the effect that in a village in which & corpse lies unremoved, there is to be no eating, no Vedic study and no sacrifice, but that this does not apply where in a village there are more than four hundred brābmanas, The Dharma sindhu (p 433) also says the same about a village, but adds that this rule does not apply to a town 

The ideas of ritualistic purity went so far as to provido (as stated in the Suddhitattva quoted by the Nirnayasındhu) that if a dog died in a brāhmana's house the house became impure for ten days, that, if a šūdra, 633 a patita or a mloccha died in a brālimana's house, the house became impure for a month, two months or four months respectively and the houso had to be abandoned if a svapāka died therein

that, if a person stays in a different country and hears of a birth or death among his sapindas, he has to observe āšauca not for ten days after hearing but for that number of days that ara short of the ten days (counting from birth or death) pre scribed for sapindas. Vide Manu V. 75, Yāj II. 21 (latter half), Sankha 15.11, Pār. gr III. 10 Ašauca interferes very much with one's activities and it is hence that often-tinies people send a closed letter to their relatives living in a different place stating thereon that it be opened on a partioular day (which is the 10th day from the death of a sapinda). Every one knows the meaning of such a direction and by such a subterfuge inconvenience is avoided and the dictates of the šāstra are deemed to be satisfied. If a son hears of the death of a parent be bas to observe āśauoa for ten days from the day of hearing, but if he hears of the death of a parent before the collection of bones then he has to observe aśauca only for the days that remain (Smrti-muktāphala p. 534). There is great divergence about the period of aśauca if the death of a sapinda comes to one's ears more than ten days after the day of death. Manu V. 77 provides that on hearing of the death of a sapinda or the birth of a son after ten days (from the event) a man be comes pure after plunging into water with the clothes on and Yaj II 21 (last pāda, 'pūrne dattyodakam suciḥ') states that he becomes pure after (a bath and) offering water when the period fixed has passed off. From the words of Manu that only the father, even if he hears of the birth of a son more than ten days after the event, has to take a bath the Mit infers that there is no atikrāntāsauca for sapindas on birth 635. The Mit. quotes Devala in support (vide note 621 above). The Dharma sindhu follows the Mit. Manu V. 76, Sankha 15.12, Kūrma purāna (Uttarārdha) 23,21 state that when ten days have passed after the event of death, the man who hears of the death is impure for three days and if he hears of the death more than a year after death, he becomes pure after a bath. In order to remove the conflict among smrtis Yrdaha-Vasistha lays doira 'āśauca is for three days if the news of death is heard within three months (but later than ten days after death), for & paksipi if it is heard within six months (but later than

[Vol. three months), for one day if heard before nine months (but later than 6 months ) and thereafter (i. e. up to one year but later than nine months) one becomes pure by a bath. But the Mit, says 636 that this holds good as to all except one's parents and quotes Paithinasi and another smrti for the proposition that whenever a son staying in a distant country hears of the death of & parent whether within a year or after a year he has to observe aśauca for ten days from the day he becomes aware of it. Laghu-Āśvalayada (20.88) lays down the same exception in the case of a son. The Mit. (on Yāj, I, 21 last half) further says that the rules about atıkrāntašauca apply only to a deceased person whose upanayana had been performed. The Dharmasindhu ( 433 ) remarks that there is no atikrāntāśauca as regards the periods of one day and three days prescribed on the death of one whose upanayana bad not been performed or as regards the periods of paksini and "hres days on the death of the maternal uncle and others of a different gotra. Similarly, there is no atikrāntāšaucs with reference to the asauca for three days prescribed in the case of samanodakas; but in these cases even after the lapse of the fixed time a bath is necessary. The rules about atkı āntasauca apply only to aśauoa on death for ten days. As in the case of the son, so in the cases of husband and wife and of co-wives among themselves even after the lapse of more than a year and even if the death is in a different country the husband or wifo or co-wife has to observe āśauca for ten days Tho paronts, avea when they hear of the death of an aurasa son after a year, bevo to observa aśauca for three days. On the news of the death of a sapinda living in the same country coming to a sapinda's ears after ten days but up to three months, the period of āšauos is three days, paksins up to 6 months, up to nino months one day and up to one year a bath. Rere also there are various views such as those of Madhava and others. Vide Suddhiprakasa pp. 49-51 for various views.

It quotes 637 a sharti verse 'on hearing that a person (sapipda) died in another country and in the case of the death of an impotent person or a forest hermit or an ascetic purification follows after a bath and the same applies to sagotra sapindas in the case of abortion, The Sadasiti (35) has a similar yerse 638 The Mit. quotes two verses of Brhaspati which define what deśāntara ( a different country ) means 639 'Where there is a large river or there is a mountain which separatas (one territory from another ) or where the languages differ then there is deśāntara. Some say that a different country means the distance of sixty yoganas, while others put it down at forty yojanas and still others at thirty Yojanas. There is a difference of opinion as to whether in order to constitute a different country all three must co-exist (viz. a large river, a mountain and difference of speech) or any one of the three will suffice or whether 60, 40 or 30 yojanas yould constitute a different country or whether the require ment of ten days for news to be carried to a place would constitute deśāntara The Sm.O and Şadašīti 37 hold the view that any one of the above three is suficient while others hold other views. The Suddhiviveka 640 holds that a distance of 60 yojanas constituted deśāntara by itself, but even within sixty

yojanas if a large river, a mountain and difference of speech occurred together, that could give rise to dešāptara. The Smartyarthasāra 617 avers that deśāntara is differently described in the Smrtis, Purānas and the works on tirthas For yojana, vide H of Dh, vol. III n 185 pp. 145-146 

The Dharmasindhu (p. 435) provides that if the bones of an āhitāgne were not found and only an effigy of palāśa Jeaves were burnt, still the āśauca is for ten days even if he died in a different country and a long time had elapsed. Similarly, in the case of the effigy of one who is not an abitāgni, the aśauca is for ten days for his son and wife if they have not already obsorted any aśauca for him but if they had observed it (on hearing of his death ) then for three days (on the burning of the effigy ). For other sapindas ( than the son and wife) in the same circumstances three days and bath are respectively prescribed. 

It is provided in the Grhya kārikas, the Smrtyarthasāra (p 94), Dharmasindhu (p. 435) and other works that if & man 612 went to a distant country and no news of his being alive was heard, then his son or other relative), after the lapse of 20 years from the time when no news was heard if the man went away when he was young or 15 years if he left when he was of middle age or 12 years if he left later in life, should perforni three cāndrāyanas or thirty krcchras, prepare an effigy of the inan with kušas (or with palāsa leaves ), should burn it and then observe āśauca and perform śrāddhas &c. 

To summarize the above discussion it is clear that as indicated by Medhātithi on Manu V. 58 there is a distinction as regards the periods of āšauca and the persons affected by it in several ways (1) There is a distinction between āśauca on birth and āšauca on death; (2) As to aśauca on death numerous distinctions arise viz (a) when there is abortion (garbhasrāva or garbhapāta, as in Sankha 15 4, Brhat-Parāśara VI p 186); (b) when the foetus comes out from the 7th to the 9th month of

III, 23, Manu V, 59, Gaut. 14, 1); (f) as to āśauca on death after upadayana the duration at one time depended in the case of brahmanas on Vedic study, the perforaiance of srauta rites and whether the brahmana subsisted on ears of corn left in the field after the crops were harvested 643 (Parāśara III 5, Sankha 15 1, Atri 83, Agnipurāna 158. 10-11), (g) the duration of aśauca depended on caste (Gaut, 14. 1-4, Yāj III 22 &c ); (h) the duration of asauca depended on nearness of blood i, e. whether the person affected was a sapinda or a samānodaka (Gaut 14 1 and 18, Manu V, 59, 64); (i) the duration depended also on the nearness or distance from the place of death (Laghu-Ašvalāyana 20. 85, 89), (i) it also depended on whether the deceased died in a different country separated by a large river, a mountain or thirty yojanas (Laghu-Āśvalāyana 20.87); (k) duration depended on the time that elapsed before it came to the knowledge of the relative; (1) the duration depended upon whether another āśauca supervened when the period of the first was not over, 

If a person is born or died at night or news thereof is received at night, a question arises as to from what day the periods of āśauca are to be calculated For example, if a man died at 1 A M. on Monday, was Monday to be included in counting ton days of āšauca or was it to be excluded? There are two views on this point. 643« One view is that any time before midnight is to be counted as belonging to the previous day, while any time after midnight is to be taken as belonging to the next day. On this view in the above illustration Monday Tould be oncluded in the calculation of ten days, The other view is that the night is to be divided into three

parts and if death occurs in the first two of the three parts then the day is to be included in the calculation; if the time of death falls in the 3rd part, the ten days are to be calculated from the next day. On this view Monday would be included in the ton days. The Dharmasindhu (p. 435 ) remarks that in this matter the usage of the country is to be followed. Vide Madanapārijāta pp. 394-395 also. 

Several rules are mentioned in the smrtis about the periods of aśauca for the relatives of higher castes when they marry women of lower varnas (ie when there are anuloma marri ages). For example, Daks& VI. 12 says that if a brahmana has married wives of the four varnas, then the impurity on the delivery or death of these women respectively lasts for 10, 6, 3 or 1 day Vispu Dh. S (22, 22-24) provides that when a ksatriya has sapindas of the vaisya or šūdra varna the asauca on the birth and death of these lasts for six or three days, if a Taisya has a sūdra as sapinda then impurity is removed after six days, But when people of lover varnas have sapindas of higher varnas then jinpurity on birth and death ceases when the impurity of the higher varpa sapindas ceases, Laghu-Hārsta 84 (= Āpastambasmanti LX verse 13) bas similar provisions, Other smrtis and purānas like the Karna (Uttar ārdha 23. 30-36) mention differing views quoted in Hāralata pp 54-60, Smc M. pp. 495-496 The Madanapārijāta remarks (PP 425-426) that some say that these varging provisions may ba discarded or that they may be assigned their proper place according to the usages of the several countries or they should somehow be explained as based upon the parson affected being possessed of virtues or not or they may be held to be appli oable to seasons of distress or otherwise, 

According to the Mit on Yāj, 644 III, 22 persons belonging to the pratiloma castes have no periods of aśauca, but they have to observe rules of purification similar to those relating' to answering the call of nature Others like the Smrti-mukla phala 645 P. 495 aver, relying on Manu (X 41), that the pratiloma castas are like sūdras and have to observe the asauca prescribed for sūdras The Hāralatā ( 12 ) quotos Adipurāna to the effect that varnasankaras (i.e pratilomas)

Ašauca and pratiloma unions should follow the sūdras in the matter of aśauca and puri fication. The Smrtyartha-sāra (p. 92) states that those born of pratiloma upions should obserye aśauca if they perform prāyaścıtta, but if they do not perform prāyascitta then there is no āśauca for them. 

It has already been stated (P 215) how it was the duty of sapindas to take out the corpse and to cremate it and how carry ing the dead body of a poor brāhmada was highly eulogised (Parāśara III, 39-40). But, as Manu V 101–102 provide, if a brahmana carried through affection the dead body of one 646 who was not his sapinda, as if he were a bandhu or carried (the dead body) of his mother's bandhus (such as mother's brother or sister) he became pure after three days; but if he partook of the food of those who were bereaved by death he became pure after ten days and if he does not stay in the house of those bereaved zor partakes of their food he becomes pure in a day (but if he stays in their house though not partaking of their food he has to observe asauca for three days). Vide Kūrmapurāba (Uttarārdha 23. 37) and Visdu 22, 7-9 also. Gautama (14. 21-25) has rules on the same subject but they somewhat differ and Haradatta remarks that this āśauca is somewhat different from the aśauca observed by sapindas, viz, he becomes untouchable but he need not follow the other rules such as sleeping on the ground &c. If a person carried a dead body through greed (for money ), a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra bad to observe āśauca respectively for 10, 12, or 15 days or a month. This was called pirhārāśeuca, the word 'nirhāra 647 including the covering of the dead body with a garment, decking it with garlands, perfumes and ornaments, carrying it and cremating it. Sapindas who are observiog āśauca for the death of the same person may dine in the same house and partake of the food cooked, but not others who are not undergoing the same asauca.648

If a brāhmana who is not a sapinda of the deceased trent to the bereaved family and wept along with the relatires before the collection of bones he had to obserre aśauca for a day and then a bath if the deceased was a ksatriya or Taisya, but āśauca for three days if the deceased vas a sūdra; but he had to undergo oply a bath if he went after the collection of the bones, then the deceased as a sūdra and the treering took place after the collection of bones he had to obserye āsauca for a rhole day and night.

While a marriage 6si rite (as also caula and upa nayana), festival in honour of a deity and a sacrifice (like Jyotistoma ) are in progress, if impurity due to birth or death overtakes the performer, the materials (money and other things ) already set apart for them may be dedicated or donated to the deity or brāhmadas and no fault is incurred. Ag regards food, a smrti text 65. quoted by the Mit, says 'if in marriage, in a festival in honour of a deity or in a sacrifice āśauca on birth or death intervenes, the cooked food should be served through others (not affected by the āśauca) and the donor and the partaker of the food inour no blame Acc. to Angiras, 653 Paithinasi (q by Sm, C.) and Visnu Dh. S., when once a sacrifice (like a Somayaga), a marriage, a sacrifice or festival in honour of the mother Goddesses or a deity or the dedication or foundation of an idol or temple has been begun a supervening aśauca does not matter, Even in modern times this is followed as regards upanayana and marriage. When exactly a sacrifice or marriage ceremony may be said to bave begun is laid down by Laghu-Visnu as follows 654 in the case of a sacrifice it may be said to begin when the priests are chosen, in the case of vratas and japa when the sankalpa (declaration) is made, in the case of marriage when the Nāndiśrāddha is performed, and in the case of a śrāddha when the food meant for the brāhmanas has been cooked completely. Certain things could be taken from the house of one who was undergoing āśauca 655 on birth or death and who was the owner thereof ( though not actually

(yol, from his hand, but with his permission). The Kūrmapurīda enumerates such articles They are 'fruits, flowers, raw vegetables, salt, firewood, butter-milk, curds, ghee, oil, drugs, milk and dry food' (like laddus, lājas ). Merici (q. by Mit on Yāj IIL. 17 ) and Trimsac-chloki verse 20 prosent even longer Lists of such things. 

Some smrtis and commentators lay down rules about the asauca to be observed by slaves when their masters are in āśauca. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 22.19, Devalasqırtı verse 6, Brhaspati quoted by Haradatta on Gaut, 14,4. But ag slavery has long been abolished this topic is passed over here, 

Aśaucasannipāta or āšaucasampāta (the knowledge of another aśauca coming to a person already observing one āśauca) 656 The rules about this matter were promulgated early enough and they are based on convenience and common sense. The rules try to give relief to persons who may be sorely tried if it were held that, when another āśauca superyenes while a person is already in the midst of one, he has to finish all the days of the first āśauca and then begin the period of the second āśauca. The Gaut. Dh. S. 14,5 starts by saying that if another āśauca superyenes on one already being undergone, purification results after the remaining days of the first āšauca are over. Then sūtras 6 and 7 provide that if the second āšauca supervenes in the last night of the first āśauca then purification results in two days after the first āśauca ends and if the second aśauca comes to be known in the last watch of the night of the last day of the first asauca, the second ends in three days after the first onds. Baud Dh. S. I, 5, 123 appears to be similar to Gout, 14 5-6 Manu V. 79, Yaj. III. 20, Visdu Dh, S. 22. 35-38, Sankha 15. 10, Parāśara III, 28 lay down the general rule promulgated by Gautama 14.5. 

Some general rules concerning this topic may first be stated The first rule is that in a conflict between aśauca on death and āśauca on birth, that on death is stronger 67 The

2nd rule is that if both asaucas are of the same kind and the second is of the same duration or of lesser duration than the first then a man gets rid of both at the end of the first, but if the second, though of the same kind, has a longer duration than the first, then purification follows at the end of the one that is of longer duration. It has to be remembered that birth and death give rise to asauca658 only when they are known by a person. 

On this topic there is a good deal of divergence between the views of the followers of the Mitaksarā, of the Gaudas and Maithilas (vide Suddhiprakasa pp 74-82, Nirpayasindhu 536–540). Following the Nirpayasindhu it may be said that twelve alternatives are possible, when another ašauca superyenes on an already existing one. They are set out here. (1 & 2) If both aśaucas are due to birth and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the first āśauca there is purification from both (Visou 22,35, Sankha 15 70); (3) If both āśaucas are due to birth and the second one is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Sankha 15.10, Sadasīti 19 ); (4 and 5) If both asaucas arise on death and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the period of the first asauoa there is purification from both; (6) If both āšaucas arise on death and the second that intervenes is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Sadašīti 21); (7, 8 and 9) When the firt āšauca is one arising from birth and an āśauca due to deaths intervenes, the asauca on death must run its full course (i. e. there is no purification by the lapse of the first āśauca due to birth), whether the aśauca for death is of lesser duration than the asauca on birth, or whether it is of the same or of longer

duration (Şadasīti 18); (10, 11) If the 659 first āsauca arises on death and the superrening one is due to birth and is of lesser duration than the one on death or of the same duration then both end at the expiration of the first āśauca on death (Saiasiti 21); (12) If the first āsauca arises on death and the super vening one arises on birth and is of longer duration, then both run their proper courses (Şadasiti 21 ) 

The Dharmasindhu (P 436 ) generally follows the Niraiya sindhu but remarks: 'Asauca on death cannot be done away with by āśauca on birth which is of the same or greater dura tion; āśauca on death of the extent of paksini cannot get rid of āśauca on birth which is three or ten days in duration and āśaucs on birth extending to ten days cannot be got rid of br āsauca on death which is of three days' duration' These are the views of many triters À certain yriter says that assuc3 on birth though longer in duration can be got rid of bs asauca on death which is of lesser extent 

The Mit on Yā). II, 20 (irst half) states an exception to the above rules about asalica-sannipata Then a person's mother dies and then, while the period of āšauca for the mother's death is not over, the father dies, it does not follow that the āsauca for the father comes to an end th the end of the asauca for the mother, but the son has to observe the full period of aso the asauca for father's death Similaris, if the father died first and then, while the period of asauca for the father Tas not urer, the mother died. it does not follow that the assuca for the mother's death comes to an end rith the end of the first perida of aśauca for the father, but the son after ohserting the period of the father's āśauca has to observe āsauca for the mother ICT one paksini in addition It may be remarked that Aparāts: construes this Ferse differently by stating that if the father DJES during the period of asauca for the death of the mother, FLOP the general rule applies, viz tbat pirrification folloits at the evil of the āšauca for the mother

Special rules about ašauca 

If, while an āśauca on death is being undergone, an asauca on birth arises, the father of the child born is able to perform the rites of Jatakarma and the like, because he is to be deemed to be purified for the Donce, according to Prajāpati.661 

The Sadašiti (verse 22) provides 662 that the rule about purification on the expiry of the first āśauca in the case of succeeding asaucas on birth or death has three exceptions, viz. a woman who is delivered of a child, the person who actually cremates the body (of the deceased) and the sons of the deceased; that is, a sütika has to observe the proper period of untouch ability and one who cremates a dead body has to observe asauca. for ten days, though the delivery or cremation takes place in the midst of an āśauca on death. 

SADYAH-SAUCA (purification on the same day). It has already been seen (p 274) that Daksa (VI %) speaks of ten kinds of impurity on birth or death, the first two of which are sadyah śüuca and ekāha Ekaha means day and night togetber (vide note 622 above) The ordinary meaning of 'sadyah' is 'at once, immediately.' But when Yaj III. 29, Parāśara ITI 10, Atri 97 and other smrtis employ the word 'sadyak-šauca' what a is meant is that there is no āśauca for a whole day or three days or ten days, but only up to the taking of a bath or up to the end of the day or the end of the night on which the event occurs Panini 663 mentions'sadyah' and thirteen other words in one sūtra' as mpātas (irregularly formed). From Yāž. II. 23 (ādantajanmanah sadya acūdānnaisiki smrtā) it impliedly follows that sadyah has the meaning of '2 part of a day or a part of the night' (as the case may be) and 'naisiki' means & whole day and night (as note 622 shows).

(pp. 340-341 ) explains 654 sadyaḥ' as meaning "a portion of the day or of the night' and cites several authorities in support The Suddhiprakasa (p 92 ) esplains that sadyahšauca 'in some contexts means 'absence of āsauca,' while in others it means *bath' and with reference to those killed in battle and the like (to whom pindas have to be offered) it means 'a part of the day or of the night.' The Sartimuktāphala 665 (asaucalanda) p 481 says that 'sadyaḥsauca' means 'impurity that comes to an end by a bath' That pipdas have to be offered to those about whom there is 'sadyahšauca' is stated by the Adipurīna 665 According to the Suddhikaumudi (p 73) sadyahsauca' has to meanings, viz. (1) the entire absence of āšauca as in the cases of sacrificial priests &c (Yāj III, 28), (2) āšauca that is removed by a mere bath (as in Madu V. 76 ) 

The rules about āśauca for sereral days do not operate in fire classes of cases, riz certain persons are exempted altogether, certain activities of certain persons who would ordinarily be untouchable owing to aśauca are allowed without causing pollu tion, certain artıces can be taken by anybody without fear of pollution from those who are affected by aśauca, no assuca is to be observed for certain deceased persons owing to their faults, in the case of certain persons express terts say that no āsauca peed be observed for them These five classes will briefly be dealt with in order In the principal texts these five classes of cases are rather mixed up. In the Vjspupurāna II 137 it is provided that there is sadyaḥśauca on the death of a child, or of a person dying in another country, of a patita, or of aB ascetic or on the death of a person cominitting suicide by water, fire or hanging Vide also Gaut 14 11 and 42 and Vāmanapurada 1299.

Cases of sadyah-sauca 

297 

Yāj. (III. 28–29) prescribes that there is sadyaḥsauca (purification after a bath) in case of birth or death (of a sepinda) for priests chosen for a sacrifice (after they are offered Madhuparka ), for those who have undergone diksā for a vedio sacrifice (like Somayāga ) and those who are engaged in performing the constituent parts of a Vedic sacrifice, those who continuously distribute food at a charity house, those who are engaged in prāyaścittas like candrāyana or the vows of sālalas, for brahmacārins (when performing the duties of their ūśrona), for persons who everyday make gifts of a cow, gold etc (at the time of making the gift), for those who have realized Brahman (ascetios); there is sadyahšauca at gifts (when once begun), at marriage, in a Vedic sacrifice, in battle (for those who are about to be engaged in it), when there is commotion in a country (through invasion ), and in a severe calamity (like famine when one can accept food from any body). Gaut. (14. 43-44) says that there is sadyahśauca in the case of kings as otherwise there will be obstacles in their duties and also in the casa of brāhmadas in order to prevent the cassation of their duties of teaching. Sankhalikhita say the same 'Rija dharmāyatanam sarvesām tasmādaDayaruddhah pretaprasa radosaih' (Suddhikalpataru p. 62). It is stated in Manu V, 93 that kings, 657 those engaged in vratas and satiras (like Gavān.dyana) are not liable to undergo the blemish of ašauca, because they (kings ) occupy the position of Indra (ruler) and are like Brahma (which is free from all talnt) and Manu V, 94 clinches the matter further by observing * sadyahšauca is ordained for the position of a king which can be obtained only by great merit (in past lives ) for the sake of the protection of the subjects and the reason of this (rule) is the position that he occupies.' Similarly, Gobhilasmrti 668

The first verse is the same as Vasistha 19.48 (Furber's text is corrupt, which must be corrected into morirea) wbich cites it as Yama's. It is toe position that he holds that readers tbc king (whether a ksatriya, brālmana or sūdra) (ree from a sauca The Fouge (22, 47-52) restricts the absence of ašzuca by saying 'Llags are frec (rom Zéanca when they are per forming the dolies of a king (such as administration of justice)': TIET राजकमणि नवतिनांबते न सत्रिणांसन कारूणां स्वकर्माण न राजाज्ञाकारिणां तदिया।'

[Vol. (III, 64-65, often quoted as Chandogaparisista of Katyāyana ) states'in & gūtaka, a brahmacārin should not give up his peouliar duties (Veda study and yratas), a sacrificer his various actions (required) in a sacrifice after he has undergone diksa, one who is practising penance should not give up krcohra and the like; these do not incur impurity aven on the death of their father (or mother) The Kūrmapurāua 669 provides no impurity is declared on death in the case of perpetual or temporary brabmacārins, forest hermits or ascetics'. Similar rules are given by Atri 97-98, Lioga-purāna, pūryabhāga, chap. 89.77, The Mit. on Yāj IIL, 28 remarks that in the case of the three aśramas of brahmacārın, vānaprastha and yat, there is freedom from impurity in all cases and at all times; ascetics and brahmacārips have to undergo a bath with clothes on the death of their father or mother (Dharmasindhu p. 442 ); in the case of several others such as those who are continually making gifts or are observing vratas there is freedom from impurity only when they are engaged in those particular actions and not when they are engaged in any action whatever or when they mix up among others for everyday work, 670 Similar rules occur in Parāśara IL21-22. It has already been stated follow ing Manu V. 91 ( Visdu 22,86 ) thet a brahmacarin was not to perform the last rites (of carrying the corpse, crenation) for anybody except for five persons (viz. his parents, upadhyāya, ācārya and guru ) He did not incur āśauca by performing the funeral rites of his parents and offering water and pinda to them, But if he did so for any one other than the five mentioned by Manu he had to observe āśauca for ten days, and to undergo prāyasoitta and had his woanavanu performed again. A brahma Carin had to observe after samūrartana (returning from the Vedio teacher) asauca for three days for all relatives that died during the period of his studenthood ( Manu V. 88. Vispu Dh, S. 27,87). Gautama (14. 42-44) says generally671 that on the death of child

Enceptions to āśauca 

sho are sapindas, thou ea for kinetotecting the no 

ran (before the appearance of teeth or before Cūda), of those who are separated by a country, of ascetics and of those who are not sapindas, the relatives are purified by only a bath; so also there is sadyahśauca for kings, for otherwise there would be conflict with their duty (of protecting the subjeots) and for a brāhmana also in order that there may be no cessation of Vedic study.672 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 93) remarks that though there is no āśauca (as stated by Yāj III. 28 ) yet & sacrificia) priest and & diksita had to bathe on the death of a sapinda, a brahmacarin also would have to take a bath if he followed the funeral procession of his father of mother &c, but an ascetic would not have even to bathe and that usage was the same in its day. 

The second class of exceptions refers to cases where certain persons, though they have incurred āšauca, are allowed to do certain acts or carry on their activities without bringing pollu tion to those with whom they deal or come in contact. For example, Parāśara (III. 20-21) says; 'craftsman (such as those who drary pictures or washermen), workers (cooks and the like), physicians, male and female slaves, barbers, kings and śrotriyas are declared to be sadyahśauca, as also one observing & vrata (cāndrāyana &c.), one purified by baing engaged in a sattra (such as Gavām-ayana), a brāhmana who has established śrauta fires; the king has not to observe āśauca and also any one (such as his purohita) whom the king for his own purpose desires pot to observe it. The Adipurada673 gives the reason why craftsmen, physicians and others were allowed not to observe āśauca when engaged in their peculiar tasks, viz, what these people do cannot be done by any one else at all or at least so well or go easily.

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. It has 674 to be noted that the absence of āšausa in the case of oraftsmen, physicians and the like has to be restricted to the peculiar activities of these and does not extend to all actions such as religious rites, érāddhas and gifts This is clear from the words of the Visoudharmasūtra 675 22. 48-52. The Trimsacchloki (verse 18 ) 676 gives a long list of such peculiar activities The Kūrmapurāpa (Uttarardha 23 57-64) has nine Verses on this topic which are quoted by the Hāralatā (p. 114), 

It has already been seen (pp 238–240) that Pār gr. II, 10 (nityāni vinivartante paitānavarjam), Manu V. 84, Yaj II 17 (latter half) provide that even those who have to undergo ašauca on death should not stop rites to be performed with srauta fires, but should perform then themselves or get them performed through others. Thus certain religious rites were allowed to be done øven by those who were aśaucın. 

The Dharmasindhu (p 552) emphasizes that this exception to āśauca should be availed of only when there is no other alternative or in a season of distress, 

It has already been stated hovy certain materials and things can be received without any pollution from thoge who are undergoing āśauca. That is the third class of cages which are exceptions to the rules of āśauca. 

The fourth class of cases where rules of aģauca do not apply relate to persons deceased to whom some fault or taint attaches. Gaut. (14. 11) 677 and Sankha-Likhita provide that there is sadyahsauca for those who kill themselves (1. e. commit suicide) by starting on the great journey (to the Himalaya), by fasting, by a weapon (like a dagger), by fire or poison or water or by hanging or by falling down from a precipice.

Yaj. III, 6 provides 678 that women that have gone over to heterodox viets and practices, that do not belong to any particular āśrama, that are thieves (of gold and the like), that (attempt to) kill their husbands, that are unchaste and the-like, that drink liquor and that attempt suicide, do not deserve to have water offered to them (on death) and no āśauca should be observed for them. This verse applies to men also as far as possible. Manu V. 89-90 are to the game effect, The Kūrmapurana alao prescribes 67) that for him who kills himself by means of fire, poison and the like, no āśauca, no cremation and no offering of water is prescribed, there is no cremation for patrias, nor antyesti nor collection of bones, no shedding of tears and no pinda and no sraddha should be per formed for them. It is provided by Angiras quoted by Mit. on Yāj III, 6 that death results to evil-minded men from capdalas (with whom a quarrel is purposely got up), from Tater, from a snake, from & brāhmana, from lightning and from animals that have sharp fangs (like tigers). If water and pinda are offered to such people (who die wilfully in these cases) they (water and pinda) do not reach them and perish in mid air.' These verses refer to death in a wrathful fight with tigers, snakes and the like or guicide in water through wrath or sorrow, But, if one died in vater or by fire through inadvertence or negligence, then Angiras 650 himself provides that water should be offered and ašauca should be observed. Long pagsages are quoted from the Brahmapurāna by Haradatta on Gaut. 14. 11, Suddhiprakāśa pp. 56-57, Nirnayasindhu p. 550, which elabo. rate the same ideas as those of Yaj. II. 6, Angiras and others and wind up by stating that if any one offers water or śrāddha to patzłas through affection or cremates then, he has to undergo prāyaścitta (viz. tyo Taptakrcobras).

II pp 926-928 for detailed treatment of this topic If a man killed himself in the way allowed by the śāstra then there was no blemish and āsauca had to be observed and water and śrāddha had to be offered.

The passage quoted by the Mit, makes it clear that Narā yapabali is meant only for those who commit suicide and is to be offered one year after the death of the person guilty of suicide. The Hāralata 683 (p. 212) also says the same and explains a verse of Vispu extending the performance of Nārā yanabali to those killed by coys and brāhmabas and those who become patata as a usage restricted to a certain country only, 664 

The Antyestipaddhati of Nārāyanabbatta describes (on fojio 187) Nārāyanabali rite at greater length than in the Mitaksarā. One or two details may be pointed out. Five kalašas (jars) are to be placed over a quantity of rice or yavas, then filled with water, then have the three mantras 'Apo bi sthā

X 9,1-3) repeated over them, then copper platos are to be placed ovor them on which five images of Brahmā, Visou," Siva, Yama and the deceased are to be drawn and the worship of these five is to be performed respectively with the Purusa sūkta (Rg. X. 90), Rg. X. 121 1-10, Rg. I 43.1 (=Tai, A, X, 17), Rg X, 14, 13 and the naine and gotra of the deceased, sixteen oblations of cooked rice are to be offered to Nārāyana with the sixtoen verses of the Purusasūkta (R: X. 90). Ten pindas 685 are to be offered on darbhas to the deceased after repeating his name and gotra (as stated in the note below). After the ton pindas are cast in a river, there is tai pana of the deceased sisteon times with the sixtaon stanzas of the Purusa sūkta. Then bali is offered separately to Visnu, Brahmā, Siva and Yama with his servants. 

In the Mitālsarā, there is no homa nor bali, both of which are described in the Antyestzpaddhati and the Smrtyartbasāra (pp. 85-86) copies verbatim the procedure given in the Mit, Brhatparākara (V. pp. 175-176) contains the same procedure that is set out by the Mit. from the Vispupurāna. The Nirnaya sindhu first describes Nārāyapabali as gathered from Hemadri and the Garudapurada (III, 4. 113-119) It then describes Nārāyanabali to be performed for a deceased ascetic on the 18th day (along with Pārvanaśrāddha), following the procedure lajd down by Baudhāyana. It then describas another form of Nārāyanabali based on Saunaka which is meant for all those who commit suicide or who are killed by oāndālas, 6% snakes, lightning, animals with fangs or who die in a distant land of for ascetios and yogins. The Vrddha-Haritasmrti (IX. 123–145) describes another method of Nārāyapabalı for devotees of Vispu. 

The Vaikhānasa-smartasūtra (X. 9) sets out a rather brief procedure of Nārāyanabali which was intended for the boven of men who committed suicide or were slain and for ascetius and provides that the same may be performed for those guilty

Baudhāyana-grhya-segasūtra II. 20 and 21 contain two different sets of the procedure of Nārāyaṇabali, the latter of which appears to be the later one. The latter contains the well-known Verse about death at the hands of candālas, from a snake &c. 

The 5th class of exceptions to aśauca rules comprises those that are declared by express texts as not liable to observe an asauca, Gautama (14. 8–10) provides 687 that (the sapindas) of those that met death for the sake of cows and brābmanas, of those that met death through the wrath of the king and those that were killed in battle bave to observe no āšauca but only 'sadyahšauca'. Manu T. 95 and 98 state 688 that(the sapindas) of those that are killed in a sudden affray or by lightning or by the king (for an offonce ) or of those that not death in protectia ing cows and brābmanas and of one who was killed in the fashion of ksatriyas in a battle by the sword have to observe no ašauca, as also he whom the king deaires (for his purpose) to observe no āšauos. It is provided by Sātātapa 689 that as regards a yatı dying, bis sons and other sapindas are not to offer vater or pinda to him or to observe aśauca for him. The Dharmasindhu (p. 449) says that this applies to all ascetics, whether they be tridandın or ekadandın, hamsas or parama hanisas. So also on the death of a vānaprastha there is no āśauca. In the case of one who has performed his own sraddha while alive his sapindas have an option either to observe asanca or not. On the death of a brahmacārin āšauca is to be observed, The Dharmasindhu further notes that in all yorks it is stated that there is no āśauca 690 for one killed in battle, but at least

(Vol. 

among brahmanas (i. e. as to brāhmanas killed in battle) th usage of the sustas is different (i. 0. Agauca is observed). 

Parāsara (II. 12-13) provides that, if a man has gone for many years to a distant land and it is ascertained that he died there but the exact date of his death is not known, then either of three tethis viz, the 8th or 11th day of the dark half or the amāvāsya should be accepted as the day of his death and water, pinda and śrāddha should be offered on that date and the Par. M. I. 2 p. 237 adds that āśauca also inust be calculated from that date. On the other hand Laghu-Harita says that if there Is some obstacle at the time of a grāddha or when the date of death is not known, then the funera) rites should be performed on the 11th tithi of the following dark half (Suddhikaumudi p. 17) 

The digests lay particular emphasis on the fact that in matters of aśauca the usages of a country must be observed. The Hāralatā (pp. 55, 205 ) quotes passages from the Adipurada where special reference is made to the authority of the usages of & country (desa-dharmapramāpatvāt). The Suddhitattva p. 276 quotes692 & verse of Marici 'one should not disregard the manner of observing sauca and religious usages that are current in particular localities; the dharma is of that sort slone in those localities'. On p. 276 it quotes & passage of the Vāmanapurana to the same effect. 

It deserves to be noted that Daksa 692 (VI 15) states that all rules about asauca apply when the times are easy and peacefu) but when a man is overwhelmed by distress there is no (enforcement or application) of the (rules of) āšauod 

Visnu (19. 18-19) provides 693 that at the end of the period of āśauca one should go out of the village, get himself shaved and take & bath after applying a thick paste of sesamo or white mustard to the body, change garments and then re-enter the house. Then he should perform & tāntı (propitiatory rite!

and honour brahmanas. Many medieval digests provide for & more elaborate procedure. For example, the Suddhikaumudi (pp. 155-164) sets out the procedure of the 11th day separately for the followers of the three Vedas. A few salient points may be mentioned. After & bath for the whole body, the sapindas should touch a cow, gold, fire, dūrvā, clarified butter and repeat the name of Gorinda, then engage brāhmavas to sprinkle śānti water over them and say 'spasti'. If a brāb mana cannot be had one should himself perform śānti. The Hāralatā and others say that without sānti wator āśauca is not completely removed. The followers of Sāmaveda should sing the Vāmadevagāna for sānti or should repeat the four Vāmadevya versos viz. 'kaya naścitra,' 'kastvā satyo,' abhi sū nab' (No. 682-684 of the Sāmayeda) together with the last Verse of the Sāmaveda 'syasti na Indro') preceded and followed by the sacred Gayatrt; these form the śānti mantras for Sāpiaredins. For followers of Yajurveda seventeen mantras beginning with 'rcam Tācan prapadye' and ending with 'dyauh śāntih', preceded and followed by the Gayatri form the santi mantras; the ægvedins should employ for śānti Rg. X. 9, 4, VII, 35.1, V. 47, 7 &c. preceded and followed by the Gayatri. Then some gold with silver as daksidā should be donated to a brāhmana, then the Vaitaradi cow should be donated, if one was not given at the approach of death, then a gift of the bedstead &c. should be made. 

We have seen (p, 270) that originally the sūtras (like San Sr.) and smrtis (like Manu) emphasized that one should not inorease the number of the days of asauca and that men learned in the Veda and consecrating srauta fires bad to undergo only one day's asauca (Parāśara IIL 5, Daksa VI. 6). But ultimately a flat period of ten days of asauca (Manu V, 59) for all sapindas oame to be prescribed. In the old days the means of communi cation were very limited, and hence the news of a birth or death must have taken considerable time to reach relatives staying eron at a short distance and hence the restrictions imposed by the rules of ābauoa were not felt to be very irksome It is on account of this reason and also the great penchant of dharma Šāstra writers for all sorts of divisions, sub-divisions and classifications that we find medieval writers bestowing an enor mously exaggerated attention in very exuberant and enthusias.. tic style on such a subject as ašauca Most nations have their OF_usages to ipdicate that a person (male or female) oz. family is jn mourning.

can equal (much less surpass) the Dharmaśāatra writers in the elaborate rules evolved in books about ašauca on birth and death. In these days when there is a State postal system and the njeans of communication abound owing to railways, air. mail, telegraph and wireless, the ancient and medieval rules of āģauca are felt by all people to be most galling and tronblo some Mischievous people sometimes create trouble ju the cele bration of marriages by sending information about a death or a birth to persons against whom they have a grudge, Devices have to be employed for dodging the inconvenience due to rules of āśauca. It is therefore necessary to introduce substantial changes in the rules about āśauca that will prevent trouble, Joss of time and work and would at the same time be mord or less in agreement with the spirit of the dicta of the smrtig and the gentiments of most common people. At the end in the appendix note 693a is added which gives the text of the Āśauca-dašaka with Sanskrit explanation. 

As regards āšauca on birth I would recommend that here after in the changed set-up of society in these days one simple rule should bo observed, viz. it is only the mother that has to observe impurity for ten days and no one else has to observe impurity on birth. This is in general accordance with the ancient smrtis set out above, 

As regards impurity on death four rules should ordinarily suffice.6920 

(1) Asauca for ten days on death should be observed by the father and the mother for the son and by the son for the parents, by the wife for the husband and vice versa and by oile who performs the rites of cremation and the rites after death. 

(2) For others (than the above) staying near the deceased as members of a joint family āśauoa for only threo days should suffice, 

(3) For all other relatives of the deceased whenever the nows of death may reach them within a year after death, only a bath should be enough. 

(4) When the death Jocurred more than a year bofors the news reached the relatives not even a bath should be required in the case of any relative except those mentioned in the first rule, who should be held olean after a bath.

Most important tabus Practices observed among ancient and modern primitive tribes show that the most important fabus were those on the dead, on women in child-birth and women in their monthly illness Among the ancient Israelites all that were unclean through the dead were put outside the cainp and they were not allowed to offer an offering at the Passover (Numbers V.1-4 and IX 6). Among the Syrians those who belonged to the family of the dead man vere tabu for 30 days and could then enter only with shaven heads Child-birth made a woman unclean and the number of days that she vas to be unclean depended on whether the child was a male or a female (Leritious '1% 2-5). In India also the ancient Aryans probably inherited their ideas about unoleanness on death and child-birth from their remote ancestors If one may surmise one can say this it must have been found out by the remote ancestors of the Vedic Aryans that if a person touched a dead body or used the clothes worn by the dead man when living, he also suffered from the same disease (particularly in the case of contagious diseases like plague, cholera, typhoid &c.) and that segregating such a person for ten days from other members of the tribe' or community made the latter immune from the attack of such diseases. Therefore, those who touched the dead or carried the corpse for cremation or burial abd the members of the family were thought to be unclean and were segregated for ten days. Gradually the ideas about the uncleanness on death and the necessity of segregation were made applicable to death due to all diseases or causes whatever. The uncleapness on child birth might have been a case of extension by analogy derived from the tabi on death At all events smrti writers put botlı on the same level (a, g, Manu V 61 "Just as impurity on death is ordained for ten days in the case of sapindas the same holds good in the case of birth"). Rules about women in their monthly illness were prescribed as early as the Tai. S. and have been already dealt with in of Dh, vol. IL pp. 80%-805, 

We have now to turn to the subject of suddhi apart from ūšauca. Suddhi of a diavya means the 694 removal of a taiat attaching to a thing and it is of two kinds, purification of the body and the purification of an external Object (Manu V. 110 and Aparārka 253). It has already been seen (zote 555

History of Dharmalāstra above) how even thc Rg. Jays great emphasis on śuddhi and being pure (suci). There are Vedic 695 passages laying down that the cups (grahas) used in Jyotistoma and other sacrifices were to be cleansed with a strainer of wool, but not the camasas. In the Ait. Br. 32.4 it is provided that if the milk of an agnihotrını that was heated by him for the homa became impurs (amedhya, by an ant or vorm falling therein ), the milk is to be taken up in an agnihotrabavads and was to be poured upon the ashes near the Ahavaniya fire. This shows that great care was taken about the purity of vessels to be used in sacrifices and about the offerings to be made Šauca is one of the eight qualities of the soul (almagungs) mentioned by Gaut 824, Atri (verses 33, 35), Matsyapurāna 52. 8-10, Brhaspati (q. by Aparārka p 164 ). Haradatta on Gautama quotes a verse that sauca is of four kinds viz. monetary purity, mental purity, bodily purity and purity in speech ; while Atri and Brhaspat75% (q. by Aparūrka p. 164), aver that sauca is constituted log avoiding what ought not to be eaten, by associating (on)) with those who 3re not censured (i. 8. are not reprehensible) and by firmly abiding by one's own prescribed duties. Many works divide squca into two varieties viz bahya (external) and antara or ābhyantara (internal). Vide H, of Dh vol. I. pp 651-5% for passages from Baudhāyana Dh, S. (I 5, 3-4), Harita, Daksa and others defining and subdividing these. Agni 37%. (17-18) is the same as Daksa V.3. The Vanaparva 200,52 speaks of purity in speech, in actions and that brought about by water The Padma (II, 66, 86-87) emphasizes that it is the mental attitude that is the highest thing and illustrates it by saying that a woman embraces her son and her busband with different mental states. There is an interesting passage in the Lingapurāna 8. 34-36 (not quoted there) which after stating that ābhyantara sauca is superior to bāhya sauca (verse 31) reniarks 69 that one void of inper purity is dirty even after a

Importance of mental purity

bath, that gloss, fish and animals subsisting on fish are always immersed in water, that in spite of that no one would call them pure, that therefore one must always endeavour to secure inner purity and that one should bathe in the water of correct know ledge of the Self, apply Once the sandal paste of faith and purify oneself by the clay in the form of desirelessness and that this is declared to be the real) sauca. Manu V. 106 provides that of all kinds of purity mental purity is the highest. He who is pure as to wealth (i. e. who does not deprive another of wealth by unjust means) is the (only) pure man and not he who is purified by water and earth. Vispu 22. 89 is the same except that for wealth (artha) it substitutes food (anna ). The Trikāndamandana (prakirpaka 21) has the same verse as Madu V. 106. Vide also Anusagana 108. 12 (for purity of conduct, of mind, of a holy place, purity due to correct philosophical knowledge); Brahmānda II, 14, 60 (sucikāmā bi devā vai), and Yogasutra II. 32 (for sauca as one of the five niyawas). 

External purity of the body by various means (ringing the mouth, bath & c.) has already been described in detail in . of Dh. vol. II pp. 648-668. The ancient and medieval Indians insisted on a daily bath for all, recommended two baths w day in certain cases and three baths to a hermit and did not subs cribe to the view of some of the early Christians, St. Agnes was canonized primarily for her refusal to bathe and St. Francis of Assisi considered dirt as one of the proper insignia of holy poverty. 698 

In šrauta rites (such as Agnistoma) the sacrificer had to undergo & sovere discipline of consecration (or dikgā ), one item of which was the purification of the intending sacrificer's body by the adhvaryu priest by rubbing the former's body twice with three bunches of seven darbhas each (vide E, of Dh. vol. II, p. 1136) Śātātapa q by Sm, O. I p. 120, Suddhiprakaśa p. 147 provide bath for one who has sexual intercourse with his wife during the period from the 5th to the 16th day after monthly illness begins, but for intercourse after these days the purifica tion is the same as for urination and voiding ordure ; bath is also prescribed for vomiting after sunrise, after shaving, after a bad dream, on the touch of foul men (such as candālas ).

I Vol. The Ap śr. II. 12 provideg 699 that Pavitresti should be performed by him who is desirous of suddha and that if one performs in each season the three stis, viz Vaišvānart (to Agni Yaiśyādara), Vrātapati (to Agni Vratapati) and the Pavitresti one purifies ten generations (of his family ). 

The following pages will deal with the purification of things (dravyasuddhı ). But & few general observations must first be made. The Ap Dh, S (II 6.15 17-20) states that infants do not become polluted or impure (by the touch of a woman in ber monthly course) up to the time the samskūra of annaprū sana (taking cooked food for the first time), that, according to some, up to one year or as long as they cannot distinguish betspeen the different directions or up to the time of Upanayana according to others. Manu V. 127-133, Yā, I, 186, 191-193, Vispu Dh. S 23. 47-52, Baud, Dh I 5 56-57, 64, 65, Sankha 16 12-16, Mārkandeya-purāna 35 19-21 state that the following are always pure.what is not seen to be polluted; what is cleansed with water; what is commended expressly (by a brahmana as pure, when there is a doubt), water collected on (pure) ground that is not visibly polluted by an impure thing and that in quantity is so much that a cot can slake its thirst therein and that bas the smeli, colour and taste of pura water ); the hand of a craftsman ( such as a washerman or a cook while engaged in his peculiar work); articles exposed for sale in a market such as rice and barley (though touched by many intending buyers); alms (collected by a brahmicūrini though walking from house to house on the road), the mouth of a woman (at the time of dalliance), meat of animals soizod or killed even by dogs, cāndālas, and carnivorous birds, rays (of the sur), fre, dust, the shadow of a tree or tho like), a cow, a horse, land, vind, der drops, flies, a calf at the time of making the cow flow with milk from the udder-these lattor 

Then it are pure when they come in contact with a person was said that certaid birds and animals were cither alkoys pure or as to certain parts of the body e... I. 194 say that the mouths of goats and horses are pure but not of the cow. Baudhāyana 700 quoted by Aparārka p. 276 provides that

Bṛhaspati 701 and Yama (q. by Apararka p. 276) state: 'the feet of brāhmanas, and the mouth of goats and horses, the backs of cows and all limbs of women are pare; the cow as to its back, the elephant as to its shoulder, the horse as to all its limbs and the dung and urine of cows, sll these are pure'. Atri (240, 241) contains several verses 702 on this point, 'Things taken out from a ming or from kit chens (or places where grain is pounded &c.) are never impure, singe all such places (where anything is prepared in the mass) except a place for the manufacture of liquor are pure. All fried (or roasted) things, fried barley and grain, dates, camphor, whaterer else is well fried is pure'. In Atri V. 13 we read 703 'flies, a continuous stream (of any liquid), the earth, water, fire, a cat, & vooded ladle and a mongoose are always pure, Parāśara (X. 41) states:774 'spacs (ākāśaḥ, vind, fire, water fallen on the earth, darbhas are not to be deemad polluted just 3s camasas in sacrifices are held to be not polluted.'

Sankha 16.15 is to the same effeot 

Sankha 708 states that whatever removes the dirt (or polla tion) that is natural to a substance or arises from contact with another polluting substance must be declared to be its purifier. Sankha-Likhita 709 declare that the substances that bring about purification of all (polluted things) are trater, clay, the powder (or paste) of soap berries, bilya fruit, rica and mustard cake, salts (ashes), cow's urins and dung and that according to some when a substance is heaped up in a big mass, sprinkling with water, Manu V. 118, Yaj. I 184, Visou Dh. S 23.13 also provide that sprinkling with water is the mode of purification when large quantities of corn or clothes are pollu ted, but when the quantity is small they must be washed with water. The quantity is said to be large when it is more than what one man can carry as a load (according to Kullüka on Manu V. 118). 

The general rule laid down by Gaut. I. 45–46, Manu V 126 ( Vispu 23. 39), Yaj. I 191 about the purification of things or bodies that are smeared with foul matter is that water and earth are to be employed for purification till the foul odour and the contact of the foul thing is entirely removed 719 Dorala (q. by Aparārka p. 270) defines sauca as the removal by means of clay, water, cowdung and the like of the besmearing, the oiliness and odour of a thing that cause impurity.

316 Purification of things 

Gaut. Dh. S. (I. 28-33 ) briefly deals 710a with the purification of things as follows: Purification of metallic substances (like bell-metal), earthenware, substances manufactured from wood, cloth made of threads or yarn is brought about respectively by rubbing (or scouring) them, by baking in fire, by chiselling or planing, by washing in water; objects made of stones, jewels, shells and pearls are purified by the sama means as metallio substances; bones (ivory and the like) and mud ( floor of houses) are purified in the same way as wooden substances; and earth (when polluted) is also purified by adding to it earth (brought from another pure spot); ropes, chips of bamboos and reeds, leather are purified by the same means as cloth or they may be abandoned when they are extremely polluted (as by the spilling of wine or urine or ordure). Vas (II. 49–53) has almost the game words, employing the word 'bhasmaparimārjana' (scour ing with ashes and washing) for 'parimārjana'. The Āp. Dh. S, (I. 5, 17. 10–13) 711 provides: 'If one gets a used vesse) only, he shall eat from it after having heated it thoroughly; a vessel made of metal is purified by being scoured with ashes and the like; & wooden passel becomes pure by being scraped; at a sacrifice, Vessels must be cleaned according to the precepts of the Veda.' Yaj. (IIT, 31-34) states; time (lapse of ten days of a year as to ašausa), fire, religious rites (like Aśramedha or performing of sandhyā), clay, wind, mind, spiritual knowledge, austerities (such as krochra), water, repentance (in the case of sins), fastingmall these are the causes of purification. Gifts are the (main) cause of purification for those who do what is forbidden, flow of water in the case of a river, clay and water are means of suddl in the case of substances that are not clean, sannyāsa (order of asceticism) in the case of the twice-born, austerities in the case of those that bave studied the Veda when they commit a sin (through ignorance), forbearance in the case of those who know the Self, water in the case of dirty limbs, silent recital of Vedic mantras ( Japa) is the means of purifica

Mama V. 107-109 (= Vispo 22,90_92) contain almost the ssme idea ia almost the same vords. 

la prescribing the methods of cleaning polluted objects certain matters have to be considered according to a rerse ascribed to Baudhāyana 112 by the Afit, (on Yāj I 190) Thich states: 'One should prescribe means of purification after con sidering the time, the place, the body (or himself), the thing (to be purified), the purpose for which the thing is to be used, origin (of defilement), the condition (of the thing or person defiled). 

There is some divergence of riers about the means of puri fying or cleansing certain objects. Tt is unnecessary to get ont in detail these differences. It is proposed to take certain objects one after another and to specify how they rere rendered purs according to several of the smrtis and digests, 

Certain foul things Trere said by the Surtyarthasars p 70 to be the causes of extreme pollution and certain others as causes of lesser or insignificant pollution. For example, escreti, ujno, semen, blood, fat, marron, liquor and intoxicants Tere the causes of great pollution; Thile dogs, village sine, cats, their urine, the tas from the ear, nails, phlegm, discharge froʻzz the eyes, perspiration are the causes of insignificant pollution.

I. 5 66 provides 713 that the purification of the ground is brought about by means of sweeping with a (fault less) broom, by sprinkling (cos's milk, urine or water), bs smearing with coxdung, bg scattering (pure clay on it) and by Bcrubbing away (or scraping) some of the soil, when these ara employed according to the situation of the ground and the particular impurity (of which it is to be purified) Baud Di.

Vispu Dh S. 23 57 adds daha (burning) to the five of Manu Yāj. I. 188 mentions seven means of the purification of the ground by adding dūha (burn ing) and kala (lapse of time) to the fire mentioned by Manu, According to 715 the Vāmanapurāpa the ground is purified by diggiog, burning, sweeping, treading by cows, smearing of cowdung, scrubbing and by sprinkling water, Davala quoted by the Mit and Aparārka on Yaj. I 188 gives a more elaborate treatment According to him polluted ground (bhiimi) is of three kinds, viz amedhyā (impure), dustā (soiled), and malınā (dirty). Where a woman is delivered of a child or dies or is cremated or where a spot has been inhabited by cāndālas or where there are beaps of ordure and the like, ground that is full of foul things in this way is declared to ba amedhijā, 716 That ground which is polluted by the contact of dogs, pigs, asses, camels and the like becomes dustā (soiled) and it becomes malınā (dirty) by charcoal, husk, hair, bones or ashes.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. Davāla 717 prescribes the purification of the three kinds of ground: 'Purity is of five kinds, viz. digging up, burning (with wood or grass), smearing (with cowdung), washing (with water) or the fall of rain Even amedhyā ground may be purified by these five means employed together (whero a corpse is creniated or candālas dwell) or by four (i . omitting rainfall or burning in other cases of amedhyā); ground that is dustā is purified by three (digging up, burning and smearing with cowdung) or two (viz digging up and burning) and malınā ground is purified by one (i. e. by digging up). 

The Smrtyarthasara (pp. 73-74) provides that if an idol made of iron or other metal is slightly polluted (as defined above) then it can be purified by means of pancagavya after rubbing it with ashes; similarly a stone idol, when slightly polluted, should be washed with water mixed with the clay from an ant-hill and becomes pure after being treated with pafcagavya. Any idol, if polluted with ordure, urine or village mud would become pure after first being flooded for five days with pancs gavya, after being well washed with cow's urine, cowdung and clay from an ant-hill and by being again installed (with all installation rites). Questions about the pollution of temples by the entry of the so-called untouchables or by the entrance of persons other than brāhmadas in the inmost shrine (garbhagrha) have come before the courts 8. g. in Gopala Muppanar v. Dharmakarta Subramania 27 Madras Law Journal p. 253 at p. 258, where reference is made to the ceremonies for the removal of pollution according to the Agamas and Tantras. In S. K. Wodeyar V. Ganapati (37 Bom, L R 584) the point arose whether, when a custom was alleged that in a temple at Badavasi in the Canara district none could enter the inner sanctum except persons belonging to the ten sub-divisions of brābmanas and a Lingayat entered it in spite of the protests of the worshippers in charge of the temple, his entry polluted the temple and whether he was liable to pay for the sum spent over the puri fication of the temple, the High Court of Bombay held that the custom alleged viz of excluding from the inner sanctum all that were not brābranas was proved and that the Lingayat gentle man who entered it in spite of protests was liable to pay dam ages for the wrongful entry.

Pollution of temples or idols 

319 

purrardha pp. 351-52), the Dharmasindhu (III p. 324) and other medieval digests provision is made for the re-consecration (purah-pratistha) of an idol in a temple when the idol is polluted by the touch of cāndālas or vine or is burnt by fire or is defiled by the touch of sinners or the blood of a brāhmada 718 If the idol be broken in two or more pieces or if it becomes broken (irregularly), if it be burnt or falls from its pedestal or be insulted, is without worship or is touched by an ass or the like animal, or falls on foul ground or is worshipped with the mantras of other gods,-in these ten circutostances Godhood ceases to indvell in the idol. If an idol be touched by robbers, capdālas, patita people, by a dog or a woman in her courses or if it be polluted by the touch of a corpse re-consecration is necessary. 

The Visnu dharmasutra (23.34) provides that idols when polluted should be purified in the same way in which the sub stanca of which they are made (such as stone or copper &c.) is purified and then they should be re-consecrated. If the worship of an idol already consecrated is stopped for a day, two days, a month, or two months or it is touched by sūdras or a woman in her monthly course, then at a proper time punyahavācana should be performed, an even number of brāhmapas should be fed, the idol should be submerged in water for a night and next day bathed with pañca-gavya from a jar full of it to the accompaniment of the respective mantras, then another jar should be filled with pure water and therein the nine kinds of precious stones should be cast, the jar should then have the

Recentis after the attainment of Independence some of the Provincial Legislatures in India have passed lars (eg Bomb35 Act 35 of 1947, C. P. and Berat Act 41 of 1927) throring open all Hinda poblictemples to peopie who Tere once called untouchable This is not the place to discuss in detail the arguments for and against these meastres. Many orthodox Hindus hold that their inmost feelings are hurt by this tyranny of the majority in ibe Legislatures. They feel that these meastes are contrary to the four freedoms that are promised in many constitutions Ti. freedom of speech, freedom of Torship, freedom fro'd want and freedom from fear. These measures are likely to be follored by serious consequences. It is felt that the younger generation LOS being educated has hardly any iaith in religion or in anythips being sacred, that the so-called untouchables themselves when once they have asserted their right of entering Hindu temples scarcels erer care to frequent them and the orthodox Hindus also oñen cease to worship therein. There is the further fe3r that, if majjgions feelings eren stei umasonable according to prozras sire Tiers could be tranpled upon by the Tiera oi the majority, there is no proving there the process rould stop.

From very ancient times water has been regarded as & great purifier. Rg. VII. 47 and 49 are hymns addressed to vaters as divinities and they are there described as themselves pure and as purifying others (as in Rg. VII. 49. % and 3 * šucayah pāyakah). Similarly Rg. X. 9 and 30 are hymns addressed to waters, in the former of which the waters are invoked to remove whatever sin or wrong one may have commit ted (Rg. X 9.8 'idam-āpaḥ pra vahata yat kinca duritam mayi') Atharya-veda I. 33 is a hymn addressed to waters, wherein also they are described as 'śrcayah pūvakah' (in A, V, I 33.1 and 4). The Vaj S. VI, 17 ( closely following Rg. X. 9. 8) invokes waters to remove whatever is censurable and dirty.729 In Vāj S. IV. 2 the sage prays 'May the Waters, our mothers, purify us !' 720 The Sat. Br. 1. 7. 4, 17 (S. B, E, vol. 12 p. 213) states' water is a means of purification. Visvarūpa on Yaj. I 191 quotes a long Vedic passage 121 wherein it is said "what ever creates doubt (whether it is pure or impure) should be touched with waters; then it becomes pure." It is therefore that water (hot or cold) is said to be the purifier of various kinds of vessels and of the ground in Yāj. I. 182-183, 188. Manu V, 109, 112, 126. Gobhila (1. 31-32 ) 722 lays down that when & man engaged in any religious rite hears & mantra addressed to the pitrs, scratches his body, looks at a man of the lowest caste, or allows the wind to escape from his intestines, laughs loudly or speaks an untruth, touches a cat or a mouse, or uses harsh language, has a fit of anger, he should perform ācamana (or touch water). 

According to Yāj I 187 and Visnu Dh, S. 23.56 a polluted louse is purified by being swept and cowdunged. But more stringent rules were laid down if a dog, a šūdra, a patita, a mleccha or a candāla died in a brāhmana's house (vide note 633 abore). After keeping the house vacant for the periods

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. stated in note 633, it is provided by Samvarta 22 that a house that is polluted by the existence of a corpse inside it should be dealt with as follows: earthen pots and cooked food should be cast away and thrown out of the house which sbould then be ameared with cowdung and then a goat should be made to go about in it smelling it and then the whole house should be sprinkled over with water in which gold and kisas are put in by brāhmadas rendered holy by the repetition of the Gayatri mantra; then the house becomes pure. Marici prescribes 224 that if a candāla (merely) entered a house, it can be purified by plastering it with oowdung, but if he were to stay in it Jong, purification can be had only by heating it and making flames of fire lick its walls. 

The ground in a brahmana's house, in a temple, in & 009 per should, says Yama, always be regarded as pure (unless it has been polluted). 

A great deal is said in the smrtis and digasts about the purifioation of yoter. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15, % says 725 in a general way that a person after sipping water from what is collected on the ground becomes pure But the Baud. Dh. s I 5. 65, Manu V, 128, Yaj. I. 192, Sankha 16. 12–13, Mārkandeya purāna 35.19 and others add that water collected on the ground that is of such yolume that & Cow can slake its thirst therein, that is in its natural state and is not polluted by any thing impure and that has natural colour (is transparent) and taste and odour (either no odour or a fragrant odour) is pure. Sankha says 726 the same about water collected on a stony surface and adds that the water of a flowing river is always pure. Deyala states 127 that water brought in Clean vessels is

pure but when it is (stale owing to its being stored) for one night (or more ) it should be thrown though it was pure (when originally brought). There 728 is no taint in water that cannot be agitated by any beings and in the water of springs (that flow from hills). Tanks (that are so deep) that they cannot be agitated, rivers, wells and lakes (that are similar) should not be used by the usual way of descent (the ghat) if they come in contact with capdalas and other impure persons or things, In Narhari v. Bhimrao, the Bombay High Court had to deal with the question whether a certain tank at Mahad in the Kolaba District could not be resorted to by untouchables for taking water and held that the untouchables were not prevented from using it (vide 39 Bombay L. R. R. 1295). 

Brhaspati provides that if in a well the dead body of an animal with five nails (man or beast) is found or if the well is otherwise extremely polluted all the water of the well should be taken out and the rest should be dried up by means of olothes, then if the well be built with burnt bricks flames of fire should be made (to liok the surface of the walls ), and then pancagavia should be poured over when fresh water begins to flow in (from the springs) 729, Āpastamba (g. by Suddhikaumudi p. 299 ) states the circumstances when a well may be said to be extre mely polluted: 'bair, exorements and urine, menstrual dis charge, a dead body-when a well is defiled by these one should take a hundred jars of water from it' (and further purification by putting pañcagavya in it should be resorted to if there is more water). Parāgara VII. 3 says the same about wells (with steps), wells without steps and tanks. 

Yāj. I 197 ( =Vispu Dh, S. 23. 41) provides that mud and rater on roads which come in contact with lowest castes ( like candalas), dogs and crows and buildings (like mathas) con structed with burnt bricks are purified by the wind alone

History of Dharmasastra (blowing on them ). Parāśara VII. 34 states 730 that mud and water on roads, boats, paths, grass and whatever is constructed with burnt bricks are rendered pure by the wind and the sun, 

Rain water after it fell on the ground was supposed to be impure 731 for ton days. Similarly Yogiyājāavalkya (q. by 8. K. p. 291) remarks that water of a river (dried up in summer) coming down in a flood for the first time ( after rains) should not be taken ( as pure) and also water that is agitated by some one (with the feat &c.) and waters that start in & separate stream by themselves from a holy river (like the Ganges ). Even when a well (without steps ) or a well (with & flight of steps) or a reservoir with a dam is constructed by men of the lowest castes, no prāyascitta is prescribed for bathing therein or for drinking water therefrom. 132 

Visnu Dh S 23, 46 provides 733 that the purification of small reservoirs of water that are static (i. e, froin which no stroams flow down ) is made in the game way as that of sells (without steps ), while in the case of large reservoirs no po]}u tion is recogaised. It is declared that waters are purified by the rays of the sun and the moon and the contact of the wind and by cowdung and the urine of cows; some of these ideas are supported by modern scientific discoveries,

thirsty travellers ) in a forest or from a jar placed near a well (for drawing water by any body ) or the water in (a stone or wooden ) trough (meant for all and sundry) and water from a leather bag even though these may not belong to a śūdra are unfit for drinking, but one may drink even such water as much as he desires when in distress. This shows that even in ancient times water was carried in leather bags or drums where there was scarcity of water and was allowed to be used even by twice-born people. 

We may now turn to the purification of metals and vessels. Baud, Dh. S. I. 5. 34-35 and I 6. 37-41, Vasistha III, 58 and 61-63, Manu V. 111-114, Yāj. I 182 and 190, Visnu 23.,2, 7, 23-24, Sankha 16. 3-4, Smrtyarthasāra p. 70 and others lay down rules about the purification of metals which do not agree in details. Therefore it is proposed to set out only what is said by Manu and one or tryo others. Manu (V. 113 ff.) says "The vise declare that the purification of metals (like gold ), of precious stones (like emerald), of all articles of stone is brought about by ashes, water and clay. Articles of gold that are not smeared (with dirty things like leavings of food &o.) become pure by means of water alone; the same holds good of articles that are found in water (ooral and shells ), that are made of stone and are made of silver on which no craftsmanship (such as drawing lines or figures ) has been expended, Gold and silver sprang forth through the union of water and fire; therefore their purification is brought about best by their causes, viz, water (in case of slight pollution) and fire (in case of extreme pollution). The purification of copper, iron, bell metal, brass, tin and lead should be brought about by salts (ashes ), acids and water according to circumstances (i. e. pollution caused). Vasistha (III, 58, 61-63) says: 'bell-metal is purified with ashes, gold and silver with water alone and copper with acids. Yāj. I. 190 says 'the purification of tin, lead and copper is brought about by salt water, acids and ordinary water, of bell-metal and iron by ashes and water,' The Lingapurāna (pūrvārdha, 189. 58) says: bell-metal is purified by ashes, iron articles by salt; copper, tin and lead by aoids; golden and silver vessels are purified by water and jewels, stones, conches and pearls are purified in the same way as metallic vessels. Vide Vāmanapurāna (14.70) which states that copper pots are purified by acids, tin and lead ones by salts, bell-metal by ashes and water. Medhātithi on Manu V, 114

quotos a verge 735 which says 'vessels of bell-metal (or brass) wlen licked (or breathed over) by cows, in which sūdras have taken their food and which have been defiled by dogs and crows aro purified by being sooured ten times with ashes (salts).' Sātātapa has a similar verse (vide Par. M. vol II part 1p 172). 

Claborate rules are laid down about the purification of polluted pots and vessels used in ordinary life, in Baud. Dh, S. I. 5. 34-50, I 6. 33-42, Yaj. I 182-183, Visnu 23, 2-5, Santha 16. 1-5 and others. There is some variation in all these, but, as the Mit. on Yāj. I 190 remarks, it is not an absolute rule that coppor must be purified by acids alone but if purification is possible by other means, they may be resorted to It is not necessary to get out the different modes of purifying vessels, A passage from the Suddhi-prakāśa pp. 117–118 would be sufficient to indicate how this matter of põtrasuddhi (cleansing of polluted vessels) was dealt with in medieva) India. "vessels made of gold, silver, conches, shells, stones, precious stones, bell motal, brass, tin, lead are purified by mere water, provided they have no dirt or pollution sticking to thom, if these vessels are polluted by the contact of leavings of food &c. they are purified by ashes and water or acids and water according as anyone of these is appropriate; the vessels made of the above substances that are polluted for a long time owing to being used by śūdras or owing to contact with leavings of food should first be scoured with salts (ashes) and water three times and should be then cast into fire so long as it can be borne (without the vessels being broken, melted or burnt up) and then they become pure, Vessels of bell metal when polluted by only dogs, CrOWS, šūdras and leavings of food only once or licked by cows become pure by being scoured ten times with salts and water; but if they are polluted by the above several times then they have to be scoured 21 times for becoming pure, If in a vessel belonging to the three higher varnas a sūdra takes hia meal, it becomes pure after being washed four times with salts and being cast in fire and then taken up with hands that are washed clean with water. A Yessel of bell-metal that is polluted once by the leavings of a

A vessel of ball-metal that is polluted by being frequently used for holding the water expelled from the mouth after rinsing it or the water in which the feet are washed should be buried in the ground for six months, then heated in fire and then it becomes pure (compare Parāśara VII. 24-25); but if it is polluted thus only once it becomes pure after (being buried in the ground) for ten days All metal vessels polluted for a short time by the bodily dirts such as urine, excrement, semen become pure after being placed for seven nights in cow's urine or in a great river; but if they are polluted as above many times or are polluted by the contact of a corpse, a freshly dalivered woman or a woman in her monthly course they become pure after being thrice washed with salts, acids and water and after being heated in fire till they can bear it, but if these are polluted by urine and for a long time and frequently they become pure by being beaten into shape (manufactured) again, 

Visnu ( 23.2 and 5 ) provides that all metal vessels when extremely polluted ( as stated in note 710) are purified by being cast into fire and that vessels of wood or clay when extremely polluted should be given up, but Dovala 736 and others provide that wooden vessels when slightly polluted become pure by being planed or chiselled or by means of clay, cowdung or water and that earthon vessels if not extremely polluted become pure by being baked in fire 737 (also Yaj. I, 187). But Vas. II. 59 provides that an earthon vessel if polluted by the contact of wines, urino, excrement, phlegm, tears, pus and blood is not purified even by being burnt in fire. 738 

Special rules are provided for the purification of vessels and implements used in Vedic sacrifices. Baud. Dh, S. (I, 5, 51-52 ) 739 remarks that the camasa vessels used in sacrifices

Manu V, 116-117, Yā). I 183-185, Visnu Dh S. 23.8-11, Sankha 16.6. Parāśara VII, 2-3 and others lay down rules about the purifioation of sacrificial implements. For example, Manu (V. 116-117 ) provides 'sacrificial vessels should be first rubbed with the right hand (or with darbhas or straider) and then camasas and cups are to be washed with water before using them in the sacrifice; the carusthali (the vessel in which the oblation of boiled rice is prepared), sruc (a wooden vessel used for pouring olarified butter on sacrificial fire), and gruva (wooden ladle of a semiciroular shape) ara purified by being washed with hot water; the sphya (wooden sword), the win noving basket, the cart (for bringing the goma plant), wooden mortar and pestle, are purified with water (or sprinkling water acoording to Yaj. I. 184). 

Several rules were laid down about the purification of palluted corn and polluted cooked food. A referenco has already been made to the purification of heaps of corn Common 28780, convenience and the loss that may be caused by very stringent provisions are the considerations which prompt the rules on this subject. Visau 23.25 provides 740 that whora & heap of rice (or other grain) is polluted, one should throw away only that portion of it which is actually defiled and should submit the rest to pounding and washing with water; cooked food that exceeds in vodume one drona and that bas been defiled does not all become tainted, but that throwing away the defiled portion alone, one should sprinkle over the rest water mixed with gold on which the saored Gayatri verse has been repeated and should hold it before a goat to see it and should also bring fire near it. Vide Baud. Dh, S, I G. 44-48. "If grains of rico are polluted they slould ba washed and dried. But if it is a large quantity then sprinkling with water is enough; husked rice (if polluted) should be cast away. The same rule applios to cooked offerings. But in the case of large heaps of cooked food that portion which is polluted by dogs or crows should be cast away and the rest should be sprinkled with the Antral ?

But where food is already cooked and then it is smelt by a cow or it is polluted by the falling into it of hair, insects, flies, then Yāj. I. 189 and Parāśara VI.64-65 provide that in order to purify it water, ashes (with water) or loose earth ( with water) should be cast over it. Āp. Dh. S. I. 516. 24-29 provide that one should not partake of food in which hair exists (i, e it was there from the beginning) or anything else (like nails) that is impure or of food that is touched with an unclean substance or in which an insect that subsists on impure things exists or food which is struck by the feet of any person or in which the excrement or the tail (or Jimb) of a rat is found 

The general rule is stated by Manu V. 118 which applies not only to corn and clothes but to many other articles viz. if there is a heap or a large quantity then sprinkling with water (prokşana ) sufices for purification but if the quantity is small then Tashing with water is necessary. Manu V. 125 ( = Vişnu Dh. S. 23.38) provides that (a small quantity of) cooked food part of which is pecked by birds (whose flesh is eaten by men), which is smelt by a cow, which is struck with the foot (by a man) and over which some one has speezed or which is polluted by the falling in of hair and insects becomes pure by casting into it loose earth (and water). Parāśara (VI. 71-74) puts the matter 72 thus: "food licked by dogs and crows of smelt by a cor or ass, if littje in quantity, should be thrown &tray by a brahmana, but purification should be resorted to if it is a drona or adhaka in quantity. That portion which is defiled by the saliva of a dog or crow should be thrown away and water in which gold is put should be sprinkled over the remainjng portion, then flames of fire should lick the remaining

History of Dharmaśāstra food and brahmadas should loudly recite Vedic hymns (like the Payamābasūkta) over it and then the food becomes fit for eating". The Suddhiprakasa explains that the wealthy should not throw away food if it is more than a drona in quantity and & poor man if it is more than an adhaba 743. 

Manu V. 115 744 says that in the case of all liquids (such as oils, ghee &o.) purification (when they are little in quantity) is brought about by means of two kušas dipped into them (or by straining them through a piece of cloth into another pot) and if the quantity is large then by sprinkling (water). Sankha provides 745 that purification is brought about by mere proksana in the case of all exudations (Asafoetida &c.), jaggery, salts, gafflower, saffron and in the case of wool and cotton, Vide note 705 above about certain articles baing pure the moment they are transferred from the pots of even mlecchas &c. 

A few words may be said about the purification of different kinds of cloth and garments and the materials of which they are made. Laghu-Asyalāyana (I. 28-30) provides that a white garment is always commended for wearing (as a dhol), but they bre commended for wearing as upper garments and both are not defiled by the touch of anybody. Men may take their food or answer calls of nature while covered with both; trasara is purified by being washed while a sijken garment is always pure. Manu V. 120-121, Yay I 186-187 and Visnu (23. 19-22) provide almost in the same words that silken and woollen cloth is cleansed by saline earth (and with water and cow's urine ), Nepalese blankets by the powder of soap berry, clothes made of tree bark with Bilva fruit and linen cloth by (paste of) white mustard, Vispu 23. 6 says 746 that when a garment is extremely polluted that portion thereof which when washed with water loses its colour should be cut off. Sankha 747 quoted by Vista

Purification of garments 

rüpa on Yāj. 1.182 prescribes that garments are purified by being submitted to hot steam, by washing with water or by cutting off only that portion that is defiled. Parāśara VIL. 28 provides that garments made from banuboos and barks of trees, linen and cotton garments, garments of wool and birch bark are purified by mere proksana. 

The smrtis speak of purification of many other things, which is of little importance and is passed over here. Only a few illustrations are given here. Manu, V, 119 provides that skins and things made of split bamboos (or canes) are cleaned in the same way as Clothes, while vegetables, roots and fruits are purified on the analogy of grain. Manu V. 120-121 state that the purification of conches, horns (of buffaloes and rams) and bones and tusks (of the elephant or boar) is to be caused in the same way as that of linen or with cow's urine or water and that grass, wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled with water. Visou Dh. S. 23, 15, 16, 23 and Yaj. I. 185 are very similar. 

From the above it will be clear that purification of subst ances depends on many circumstances, viz. whether they are metalic or are earthen, whether they are solid or liquid, whether a polluted substance is small in quantity or is a big heap, whether the pollution is extremne or insignificant and 80 on, 

In Manu the purification of substances follows (V. 110) the means of purifying one's own body, Purification of the body by means of acamana and snana (bath) has already been described in H. of Dk, vol II. pp. 315-316 and 652-653 (about aoamana), 656-668 (about snāna). Purification by bath on asauca has already been dealt with before. Special rules were prescribed for vomen guilty of adultery (vide H, of Dh. Yol. II. p. 594, vol. II, pp. 647-649), as also for women raped (vide Vol. II p. 575). Snāna (bath) with the clothes on was prescribed for purification of the body when & person touches one who is patita (murderer of a brābmapa &c.), & capdala, a woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, & corpse or one who has touched a corpse; also when a man follows a funeral procession or touches a dog (vide Gaut. 14. 28-30, Mann V. 85 and 103, Angiras verse 152, Ap. Dh. S. L. 5. 15. 15–16, Yāj III, 30). Baud. Dh S I. 5. 140 provides that on touching one who sells the Veda (teaches it for money), & vūpa, & funeral pyre, a patita, a dog and a Cāndāla one should

undergo a bath 748 Parāśara also has a similar Terse,719 It has already been stated elsewrhere (in H. of Dh rol. II. pp 175-176) how the rules about touching untouchables were related then people congregated in a temple or in a religious procession, ale marriages and festivals and at holy places. It is said by some that this refers not to the so-called untouchables, but to men who are untouchable owing to āśauc. But this is not correct The explanation of the Suddhi-kaunudi and Suddhiprakasa given below makes it clear that the untouchables are meant In the first place, the words are quite general and not restricted. In the second place, there is no untouchability (except for the mother) on the ground of Jaranāšauca and it is most unlikels that a person who has incurred mourning on death should risit a temple or go to a marriage or enter & religious procession, or festival. In the third place, looking to the sereral occasions mentioned together (particularly pilgrimages, battles, firo in a town or village and commotion or invasion of a country) it appears most unlikely that the rerse refers only to ašauca on birth and death, 750 

The ancient and medieval Indians put Tery great enphasis on purity of mind, of body, of the place there they resided or performed religious rites, of the resse)s used by them and of the ingredients of thoir food and Torship. Many of the rules about purification of substances may appear to modern minds as very stringont; but it should 110$ be forgotten that the ancient Indians fere imbued with the thought that purity of the mind followed from purity of food

Reason of emphasis on purification 

333 

(as stated in the Chandogyopanisad VII, 26,2 fahārasuddhau sattvasuddbih' and by Harita). It would be conceded that some of their rules about purification (such as about large quantities of corn or heaps of cooked food) are based on common sense and convenience. We are probably going to the other extreme in taking our food anywhere and in any surroundings. 

SECTION III 

CHAPTER IX 

ŚRĀDDIA 

This subject is of groat practical importance from several points of viow. 

The Brahmapurāpa definos śrāddha as follows. whatever is giron with faith to brālmanag intending it to be for the (banofit of) trs at a proper time, in a proper place, to desery ing porsong and in accordance with the prescribed procedure is called sraddha 7st, The Mit on Yāj I 217 defines sraddha As 'abandonment with faith of an article of food or some sub stituto thoroof, intending it for (the benefit of) the departed'. Tho Kalpataru on srāddha defined it as 'the giving up of sacri ficial material intending it for pitrs and its acceptance by brāhmanas'. The Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara and the Srad dhaprakāģa dofine śrāddba in the same way as the Mit, but in a more inrolved manner, Yaj. I. 268 (= Agnipurana 163. 40-41) states that the pntrs via. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas that are the deities of śrāddha, being gratified by grāddha, give gratification to tlio ancestors of human beings. This verse and Manu II. 284 make it clear that the three ancestors of a man,

IV . 10-13) and not अर्धकर्म: similarly, the cremation of an hitagns with his sacrificial vessels is a प्रतिपत्तिकर्म so far as the यज्ञपात्रs are concerned.

Definition of frāddha 

335 

viz, the father, paternal grand-father and the paternal great. grand-father are respectively to be identified with the three orders of superintending pitr deities, vix. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, when performing śrāddha. A.ccording to some,752 sraddha denotes three things, viz, hama, the offering of pinda (ball of cooked food) and gratification of brābmapas invited to a dinner; the application of this word to any one of these three can only be in a secondary sense. 

A firm believer in the doctrine of kar ma, punarjanma (re incarnation) and karma-upāka (explained above) may find it difficult to reconcile that doctrine with the belief that by offer ing balls of rice to his three deceased paternal ancestors a man brings gratification to the souls of the latter. According to the doctring of punarganma (as Fery clearly and succinctly put in Br. Up IV. 4.4 and Bhagavad-gitā 2 22 ) 753 the spirit leaving one body enters into another and a new one. But the doctrine of offering balls of rice to three ancestors requires that the spirits of the three ancestors even after the lapse of 50 or 100 years are still capable of enjoying in an ethereal body the flavour or essence of the rios balls wafted by the wind. Further, Yaj. I 269 (which is the same as Mārk, 29, 38, Matsya-purana 19.11-12, Agnipurāna 163, 41-42) provides that the grand fathers (i. e, pitrs) being themselves gratified (by the offerings of food in śrāddha) bestow on men (their descendants) Jong life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, molşa (final beatitude), all happiness and kingdom. In the Matsya-purana (chap. 19, Verse 2) a question is asked by the sages how food which a brāhmana (invited at a śrāddha) eats or which is offered into fire is enjoyed by departed spirits that might have assumed (after death) good or evil forras of bodies. The answer given (verses 3-9) is that fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand fathers are identified with Vagus, Rudras and Adityas regpectively according to Vedic passages, that the name and gotra (mentioned at the time of śrāddha), the mantras uttered and faith carry to the patts the offerings made, that if one's

History of Dharmadastra 

[Vol. father has become a god (by his good deeds) the food offered in śrāddha becomes nectar and follows him in his state of godhood, if he has become a dastya (an asura) then (the food) reaches him in the form of various enjoyments, if he has become a beast then it becomes grass for him and if he has become a snake the śrāddha food waits on him as wind (serpents are supposed to subsist on wind) and so on. Verses 5-9 of the Matsya, chap, 19 are quoted as from Mārkandeyapurana by the Srāddha kalpalatā p. 5. Višvarūpa 754 on Yā). I, 265 (p. 171 of Tri. ed.) also raises the same objection and gives several replies. One is that this is a matter entirely based on śāstra and so when sāstra says that pitrs are gratified and the performer gets desired objects no objection should be raised. Another reply is that the gods Vasus and others that have access everywhere have the power to gratify pitrs wherever they may be situated. He does not call the questioners (nāstıla) as some other and later 

writers do. 

The Sraddhakalpalata of Nandapandita 755 (about 1600 A. D.) entors upon an elaborate reply to these persons (whom he dubs atheists) that aver that the performance of śrāddhas for departed fathers and the rest, who according to the particular actions of each go to haaven or hell or to other forms of exist once serves no purpose, He asks: why is śrāddha useless? Is it because there is no prescriptive text laying down an obligation

Does sraddha serve no purpose 

337 

to perform it or is it because śrāddha produces no consequences or is it that it is not proved that putrs and the rest are gratified by śrāddha? To the first he replies that there are such passages as 'therefore & wise mad must perform srāddha with all his efforts that lay down the obligation; nor is the 2nd objection proper, since Yāj. I. 269 does declare the rewards ( of grāddha ) viz, long life &o. Nor is the third alternative acceptable. In the śrāddha rites it is not that the mere ancestors named Deva datta and the like are the recipients and that they are denoted by the words pitr, pitānaha and prapitāmaha, but that those vords denote them as accompanied by the superintending deities FIZ. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas. Just as by the words Deva datta and the like what is denoted is not merely the bodies (so named) nor merely the souls, but what is denoted by the words is individual souls as particularised by the bodies; in the same way the words pitt and the like denote Devadatta and others together with the superintending deities (viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas). Therefore, the superintending deities viz, the Vasus and the rest, being gratified by the food and drink offered by the sons and the rest, gratify those also viz. Dersdatta and the rest and endow the performers (of śrāddha) with such towards as male progeny and the rest. Just as a woman expecting to be a mother becomes gratified by partaking of the food and drink for which she has a longing in pregnancy and which is given to her by another person for the sustenance of the child in the womb, she satiates also the child in her womb and endows those that offer her the food and drink for which she has longings by bestowing on them some reward in return. Thus the pitts denoted by the words father, granda father and great-grand-father are the deities Vagus, Rudras and Ādityas, and not merely (human beings called ) Devadatta and the rest. Hence these deities of śrāddba become the recipients (of gifts) in the śrāddha rite, are gratified by the śrāddha and gratify in their turn the ancestors of human beings. The Srāddha-kalpalatā then quotes 18 Tersee 756 from the

Theory of Śrāddha examined 

any thing on their progeny. It appears very probable that the Worship of ancestors by means of śrāddhas was a very ancient institution and that the doctrines of Punarjanma and Farmauipāka were comparatively later ones and that Hinduisme being all-embracing retained the institution of śrāddhas while adopting also the doctrine of metempsychosis. The institution ef sraddha is from one point of view an excellent one. It provides an occasion for remembrance of one's ancestors and relatives that were dear and near then living The Āryasamaja objects to the institution of śrāddha and interprets pitrs in the Rgreda as meaning living men in the Tānaprastha stage. It may be noted that the texts support both views. The Sat, Br, expressly says that food is offered to the father of the sacrificer in the words 'this is for thee,' Vispu Dh. S. 75, 4 'He whose father is dead may put down a pinda for his father &c,' On the other hand Manu I 284 states that fathers are spoken of as Yasus, grandfathers as Rudras &c and Yaj. I. 269 provides that Yasus, Rudras and Adityas are the pitts and the deratās of saddha. These latter are to be explained as con faining an injunction to contemplate upon the pitys as Vasus, Rudras &c. 

As stated below (p. 347) with regard to the Rgvedic passages, it Tas on account of the supposed poter of pitrs to benefit or harn the living that the cult of the dead became a prominent feature in primitive societies. Offerings and ceremonies which may hare in most ancient times been prompted in part at least by the desire to placate the ancestors are continued as tokens of pare affection and remembrance. Various beliefs about pitṛs are mentioned 75% in post-Vedic Literature, The Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 14 summarizes a brahmana text stating that pits move about in the form of birds, The Aušanasa-smrti and Devala quoted by the Kalpataru say the same thing. In the Vāyu parāns 759 it is stated that at the time of stāddha the ancestors

enter the brāhmanas (invited) after assuming an aerial form and that when the best of brāhmanas are honoured with clothes, foods, gifts, eatables, liquids, cows, horses and villages, pitrs become pleased. Manu II. 189 and the Aušanasa-smrti also support this notion that pitrs enter the invited brāhmadas, The Matsyapurana (18.5-7) enjoins: pipdag should be offered to the departed for twelve days after death, since they serve him as food on his journey and give him great satisfaction, Therefore, the soul leaving the dead body is not taken to the abode of the departed for twelve days (after death ), the departed spirit hovers near his house, his sons, his wife for twelve days. Therefore for ten days after death milk (and water) should be placed (hung up) in space for ten nights for reducing all torments ( or troubles of the departed) and for the removal of the fatigue of the journey (that the departed spirit has to make ). The Visnudharmasütra 760 (20. 34-36 ) provides *the departed spirit enjoys in the world of pitys the food offered in grāddha with the utterance of the word 'svadha'; whether the departed is in the state of a god or in the place of torments (Hell) or in the form of a lower animal or a human being, the grāddha food offered by his relatives reaches him; when grāddha is performed, the performer and the departed soul both certainly Becure vigour (or prosperity )," 

The Brahmapurāna 761 states that srāddha is to be treated of under five hoads, viz, how, where, when, by whom and with what materials, But before proceeding to deal with these five hoads, it is necessary to dilate upon the underlying ideas and significance of the word 'mtarah' from the most ancient times of which we have literary records, 

The word 'potr' means 'father', but the word 'pitarah' is used in two senses, viz. (1) a man's three immediate decessed ancestors, (2) the early or ancient ancestors of the human race that were supposed to inbabit a separate world (loka) by them

X,15,2 ( translated above pp. 191-92, 194 ) and Rg. IX.97.39.767a 'That Soma which becomes stronger and stronger and makes others strong, that is strained through a strainer, that flows in a stream, protected us by means of the luminary (the Sun)--that Soma with whose help our ancestors knowing the place (where the covs were kept concealed) and the higher regions, harassed the mountain for the sake of recovering) the cows,' In Rg. X. 15 1 the pitts are said to be of three grades, lower, middling or higher. They are also said to be earlier and later ones (Rg. X, 152 ). They are all known to Agni, though a]l putrs are not known to their descendants (Rg. X. 15 13). The patrs are divided into several groups such as Angirasas, Vairūpas, Atharvans, Bhrgus, Navagvas and Dasagvas (Rg. X. 14,5-6), the Angirasas being particularly associated with Yama who is invoked to come to the sacrifice along with the Angirasas (Rg. X, 14, 3-5). In Rg. I 763 62, 2 it is said: 

through whose (Indra's) help our ancient ancestors (pitarah), the Aogirasas, who sang his praises and who knew the place, found out the cows.' The ptys called Angiras were, it appears, again subdivided into two classes viz. Navagva and Dasagva764 both of which words occur in Rg. T. 62 4, V. 39. 12 and X. 62. 6. In several passages the ancient fathers are identified with the seven sages 765 as in Rg. IV. 42.8 and VI 22.2 and sometimes the Navagvas and Dasagvas also are said to be the seven sages (Rg I 62 4). Angirasas are said to be the song of Agni (Rg. X. 62,5) and also of Heaven (Rg. IV. 2. 15). The pitts are often said to regale themselves in the company of gods, 

762. This idea is at least Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-European, The Bacient Parsi scriptures speak of Fravashis that were originally the same as pitrs of ancient Hindu works or the Manes among the ancient Romano, They were the everlasting and deified souls of the dead Gradually the mean lag of Fravasitz was extended and even Gods and objects like the Earth and the sky were supposed to have each a Fravashi, Vide S. B E, vol 4 p. 262 for the Fravashis of the holy Yama and for the different classes of Fravashıs, also S. B. E. vol 23 pp. 180, 184, 230.

I Vol. particularly of Yaina (Rg VII. 76. 4, X. 14 10, X, 15. 8-10) 766 The pitts are said to be fond of Soma drink (Rg. X. 15.1 and 5, IX. 97 39), they lie down on kuģa grass (Rg X15,5), they come with Agni and Indra to partake of the offerings (Rg X, 15. 10 and X, 16.12 ) and Agni is also said to carry the offerings to the prirs (Rg X, 15. 12). Fire is supposed to take the spirit of a crematod person to the prirs (Rg. X 16, 1-2, 5=., V. 18. 2. 10, Rg X. 17, 3). In later works also (e. g. in Mārk, chap. 45), Brahmā is supposed to have created in the beginning four classes viz. gods, asuras, pitrs and human beings Vide also Brahmāndapurāna, Prakriyā, chap. 8, and upodghāta chap. 9. 35 (ityete pitaro deyā devāśca pitaraḥ punah anyonyapitaro hyete). 

It was supposed that the departed spirit, after the cremation of the body, was endowed with an ethereal body and became associated with Yama, the gatherer of departed men (Rg. X. 14. 1 and 8, X. 15, 14, X 16 5), and with pitrs, The departed spirit went to the world of the patrs and Agni was implored to take the spirit to the world of the departed whose deeds were good and to the stride of Vispu (Rg. X. 14. 9, X, 15. 3, X. 16.4). 

Although Yama is said to dwell in heaven (divi) in Rg. X. 64, 3, he is really a god of the middle region, as the Nirukta states. 767 The Atharvaveda states • 768 'let us worship with obejsance the fathers and grandfathers of our father, that enter the wide middle regions, that dwell on the earth and in heaven,' In Rg. I. 35. 6 769 it is said there are three worlds; two of them (Heaven and earth) are in the lap of Savitr; one (i. e. the middle region) is in the domain of Yama where departed spirits congregate, 'The graat Lummary (the Sun) has risen, a gift of the pitrs' (Rg X. 107. 1).

The World of Pitts it is said that the pitrs dwell in the third world from this. This means that after bhuloka and antariksa comes the pitriola. In the Br. Up. I 5.16 three wor]ds of men, pitrs and gods are separately mentioned. In Rg. X. 135, 1-7, Yama is spoken of in somewhat different language. He is in this bymn men tioned as a god by himself and not as the first mortal who made a path (Rg. X. 14. 2) or as the gatherer of men (X 14, 1) or as being in company of the pitrs In a few other places Yama is no doubt called rājan and praised in the same breath with Varuna (Rg, X. 14. 7). But such a position is very rarely mentioned, For the further development of Yama and his assistants as the punishers of men for evil deeds, vide pp. 159-160 above and notes 381-386. 

There is another division of pitrs viz. Piłarah somavantah,771 pitarah barhzşadah, pitarah agnisvāttāh The latter two are named in Rg X 15 4 and 11 (which occur also in Tai. S. IL 6. 12. 2). The Sat. Br. defines these as follows.-" those that performed a soma sacrifice are putarah somavantah; those that offered cooked oblations (like caru and purodāśa) and secured a world are pitarah barhişadah; those that did none of these (two actions) and whom fire consumes when burning them are 'pitarah agnisvāttāh;' these are the only ones that are putarah." 

The Tai.772 Br, has & somewhat similar passage and the Kathaka Sambita IX. 6. 17 also refers to these three kinds of pitrs, Later writers introduced certain changes in the mean ings of the words for the different classes of pit?s and also in creased the number of the classes of piirs. For example, the Nandipurāna g. by Hemādri states: the petrs of brābmapas are called 'agnisvātta', those of ksatriyas 'barhisadah', those of vaisyas 'kavyas', those of śūdras 'aukālin' and those of mle cobas and untouchables are called 'vyāma'. 773 Even Manu

I Vol. (IL, 193–198) mention several classes of pitrs called Somapās, Hayirbhujah Ajyapās and Sukālins with 

pilis, connects 

the four yarpas and in II, 199 states that the pitrs of brūh madas are designated as Anagnidagdha, Agnidagdha, Kārga, Barhisad, Agnisvābta and Saumya Those Ferses of Many appear to summarize different traditions about the several classes of pilys Vide Matsyapurāpa 141, 4 for the samo last four names and 141, 15-18 for their definitions. In Sātātapa. smrti (VL 5-6) twelve groups or divisions of pitrs are mentioned viz. pindabhājah (three), lepabhājah (threo), Nāndimukhas (three) and Aśrumukhas (bree). This is a classification of pitrs from two different standpoints. In Vāyu 72,1 and 73 60, Brahmānda (Upodghāta 953), Padma V, 92-3, Visnudharmo ttara I, 138 2-3 and other Purāpas the classes of pitrs are said to be seven, three of which are formless (antürlimal) and four have forms (mui tımal) and they and their offspring are des cribed in detail. All this is passed over here. The Skanda. purāna (VI. 216.9-10) speaks of nine groups of pitrs, being Agni svāttāk, Barbisadah, Ayyapāh, Somapāh, Rasmipāh, Upahütah, those called 'āgantunah', Srāddhabhujah, Nandimukhah. In this list old and new elements are mised up The Indian mind often repels in divisions, sub-divisions and classifications with out much basis therefor and this is probably an illustration of that tendency. Manu (ITI 201) states that from tho bagos tho pitrs sprang, from the pitrs sprang gods and human beings and from the gods arose the whole world whether moving or inmo. vable. It is remarkable that hore the gods are spoken of as springing from the pitrs This is really a moro oulogy of pitr: (i. e, it is an arthavada).

(pañcajadā mama hotram juşadhyam) and other passages, the Ait. Br. (13.7 or 3.31) explains that they are the five classes, viz. Gandharyas rith Apsarases, pitrs, deyas, sarpas and rākszsas, The Nirukta III. S partly follows this explanation and also gives another. In the Atharvayeda X 6. 32 the gods, pitts and men are mentioned in that order. The ancient Vedic tests and practice make a sharp distinction between the Gods and the Pitrs. The Tai.S. VI. 1. 1. 1 states: 'the gods and men divided the quarters, the gods took the east, pitys the south, men the west and Rudras the north. The general rule is that sacrifices for gods are begun in the forenoon, while the pitr-yajña is performed in the afternoon (San Br.).775 The Sat Br. II. 4.2.2 Darrates that the pitrs wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder (30d under the left arm) and bending their left knee approached Prajāpati, when Prajapati said to them you will hare food at the end of each month (on the Amāvāsyā), your stadhū (cordial) will be swiftness of thought and the moon will be your light,' while to the gods he had said that sacrifice will ba their food and the sun their light. The Tai. Br. 776 I. 3. 10.4 appears to make a distinction between pitrs who are of the nature and position of gods and pitȚs that are more or less like human beings. 

The Kaušika-sütra (1. 9-23) neatly collects in one place the difference in the procedure of the rites meant for gods and for pitṛs. The performer of rites for gods wears the sacred thread on the left shoulder and under the right armpit, while in the case of the rites for pitrs it is worn on the right shoulder and under the left arm; the rite for gods is either begun facing the east or north, while that for the pitṛs is begun facing the south; the rite for gods is finished in the north-east (or north or east), while that for the pitrs is completed in the south-west; an action is done only once for pitīs, while for gods at least thrice or as many times as the texts direct; in going round (parambulating) the right side is turned towards gods and the left one in the case of pişs; offerings are made to gods with the words 'svāha' and yaset', while they are made to pitfs with 'stadhā' and

It should not be, however, supposed that the element of fear of the pitss is altogether wanting, 7804 For example, Rg. X. 15. 6 prays 'whatever fault we may commit in reference to you through our being (erring) men do not injure us for that.' In Rg. III. 55. 2 we read 'May the gods and the ancient pitrs who know the place ( of the cows or the path ) not harm us here.' In Rg. x. G6. 14 it is said the Vasisthas praising the gods fashioned speech (hymns ) like pitts and like sages.' Here pitrs and rsis are separate groups and Vasisthas are compared to both.7806 

In many passages of the Vedic Literature the word vita ah is applied to the three immediate deceased male ancestors of a man. Therefore up to three generations they specify (the ancestors) by name; for so many are the ones to whom sacrifice is offered' (vide n. 772 above). The Sat. Br. II 4.2, 1978t mentions the presentation formulas of the cakes to the father, grand-father and great-grand-father and

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. then states that the performer mutters the words "hers, o fathers) regalo yourselves, like bulls come here each to his own share' (Vā), S II, 31 first half). Some (such as Tai, S. I. 8 5.1) repeated the fornuula "this here (ball of rice ) is for thee and (for those) that come after thee." But the Sat, Br, emphatically says that he should not offer with this formula, but rather with the formula 'this here is for thee,' In Sat. Br. XIL 8. 1. 7 the three immediate paternal ancestors are said to be svadha-loving. Relying on these Vedio passages and on the fact that Manu (III. 221 ) and Vispudharma sūtra (21, 3, 75, 4) prescribe the invocation of pitrs after men tioning their gotra and names that the Srāddhaprakāśa (p 13) concludes that it is really the father and the other ancestors that are the deities of śrāddba and not Vasu, Rudra and Aditya, since these latter have no gotra and that the description of the father and others as Vasu, Rudra and Aditya is meant only for contemplation (on them as identical with Vasus &c.). Ona passage of the Brahmapurāna 782 prescribing that the perfor mer should say to the invited brāhmanas that he would call the pitrs to the rites and that when the brāhmanas give per mission to call them he should do so, the Sr. P. (p. 204) remarks that the pitrs bere meant are the divine ones viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas and also the human ones vit, the performer's father and the rest. The Vāyupurāna (56 65-66) Brabmanda and Apu. distinguish between pitrs who are above and patrs vlio are laukika, viz father, grand-father and great-grand-father, Vide also Vayu 70. 34 for pitrs that are like gods. 

In the post-Vedic Literature, particularly in the Puranas, a great deal is said about the origin and classes of pitrs. For example, the Vāyupurāda 56. 18 speaks of three classes of pitrs Vız kāvyāh, barhisadah and agnisvāttāh', while the same Purana, chap. 73, Varāha 13. 16 ff, Padma (Srsti 9. 2-4) and Brabmanda IL, 101 speak of the origin of pitrs of seven classes that dwell in heaven, four of which have a forni (mūrizmat) and three of which are without form (amūrla). The Satātapa-smrti (6.5-6) speaks of 12 pitra viz. pjodabhājah, lepabhājah, nāndimukhāh and aśrumukhāh. All such descrip tions have to be passed over from considerations of space.

Promulgators of brāddha rites 

349 

From the sutra period (about 600 B. C) to the most modern among medieval Dharmaśāstra works the authors wax eloquent over the praiges or the importance or benefits of the institution of śrāddhas. One of the earliest works among these, viz. the Āp. Dh. S gives the following interesting information : 783 "Forinerly men and gods lived togetlier in this world. The gods went to heaven owing to sacrifices (i. e, as a reward of sacrifices that they performed), but men remained behind, Those among men who perform sacrifices in the same way as the gods did, dwell in the other world (i. e. heaven) with the gods and Brahman. Then (seeing that men lagged behind) Madu promulgated the rite which is designated by the word 'sraddha' and which tends to the salvation (or happiness) of mankind. In this rite the Manes (prtarah) are the deities but the brāhmadas (that are fed) are in the place of the āhavaniya fire (in which in sacrifices to gods oblations are offered)". On account of this last sūtra Haradatta (com, of Āp. Dh, S.) and others hold that feeding the brāhmadas is the princi pal act at a śrāddha. The Brahmāndapurāpa (Upodghātapāda 9, 15. and 10. 99) speaks of Manu as the promulgator of śrāddha rites and Visnupurāpa IIL 1 30, Vāyu 44, 38 and Bhagavata II, 1, 2% designate Manu as Sraddha-deva. Similarly, in the Santiparva 345.784 14-21 and the Visnu-dharmottara L139 14-16 it is stated that the institution of śrāddha was established in the Boar incarnation by Visnu and that Visnu should be regarded as dwelling in the three pindas offered to the father, grand-father and great-grandfather From this and from the passage of the Āp. Dh. S cited above we may infer that it was believed even several centuries before Christ that the institution of śrāddhas had a hoary antiquity behind it and that it was as old as Madu, the father of mankind according to the Rgveda (VIII, 63,1, VIII 30. 3.). It is, however, very remarkable that the word *śrāddha' itself does not occur in any undoubtedly authentic and ancient Vedic passage, though the rite called Pindapitr yajña 785 (performed on the amāvāsyā of each month by an

Alitagni), the Mabapitryajña (pozformed in the Caturmāsya called Sākamedha) and the rites called Astakās were known to the early Vedic literature. The word śrāddha occurs in the Kathopanisad (1.3.17) 'whoever proclaims this highly esoteric doctrine in an assembly of brāhmadas or at the time of śrāddha tends to secure immortality.'786 The other early occurrences of the word śrāddha known to me are confined to the sātra literature. The most reasonable and probable inference to be drawn from these facts is this that only a few rites (mentioned just above) were known as related to the pritrs and that there fore no need arose for a generic term in very ancient times to comprehend several rites for the pitrs. But when the number of rites in honour of pers increased, the generic term 'śrāddha' was hit upon, 

A few samples of the panegyrics on śrāddha may be set out here. The Baud. 787 Dh S. states that rites for the Fathers confer long life, heaven, fame and prosperity. The Harivamsa 788 says the world derives support from śrāddha and Yoga (i. e. Moksa) springs from it,' Sumantu 789 quoted in the Smrticandrikā (śrāddha p. 333 ) states nothing else is declared to be more beneficial than śrāddha,' The Visnupurāna (III. 14. 1-4) avers that if a man performs grāddha with faith he thereby propitiates Brahmā, Indra, Rudra and the other gods, sages, birds, men, beasts, creeping animals, hosts of pites and whatever else is styled a being and the whole world. Yāj. I 270 799 promising long life and severa) other benefits arising from gratifying pirs has already been quoted above (p. 337). Yama has a similar verse. It is said in a passage of the Visoudharmottara 791 quoted by the Sraddhasara (p.6) and Srāddhaprakāśa (pp 11-12) that the prinda offered to the

great-grandfather is declared to be god Vasudeva himself, the one to the grandfather is designated Sankarsana, that to the father is known as Pradyumna and the offerer of the pipdas is bim self in the position of Aniruddha, In Santiparva 345. 21 it is stated that Visnu should be looked upon as staying in the three pindas. In the Kūrmapurāna it is stated 'on the day of Amavasya tho pitrs assuming an aerial form como to the door of their former haunt and mark whether śrāddha is being per formed by men of their family. This they do till sunset. When the sun sets, being oppressed by hunger and thirst, they become full of despair and feel sorrow, breathe heavily for a long time and go away condemning their descendants. The pitrs of him who does not offer srāddha on amāvāsyā, even with water or vegetables, go away after cursing him'. 

It is necessary to say a few words about the derivation of the word 'śrāddha'. That the word is derived from 'śraddha' is quite clear. In the definition quoted above from the Brahma purada and the definition 792 given by Marici and Bșhaspati the connection of śrāddba with śraddbā is emphasized. In śrāddha one entertains the firm faith or conviction that what is given up to the brāhmanas for the benefit of the departed man or the Fathers will reach him or them in some way. The Skandapurāpa VI218.3 says that śrāddha is so called because sraddha is the root (or main spring) of that rite. This means that there is not only the conviction stated above but that there is a firm belief that a person is under an obligation to offer it. Sraddha is dejfied and addiessed as a deity in Rg. 793 X, 151, 1-5, the first verse of which is explained in the Nirukta (IX. 31). The word also occurs in Rg. I. 26. 3, VI, 32, 14, VII, 1, 31, IX. 113. 4. In some verses the two components of the word 

śraddhā' (viz. 'śrat' and 'dhā') are separated without any change in the meaning For example, in Rg. II. 12, 5 (= A. V, 20. 34.5) it is said 'Have faith in him; O people ! he is Indra'. In Rg. X 147. 1, addressed to Indra, ve have ‘I have faith in that high wrath of yours &c.' (śratte dadhāmi

S. 1977 we are told that Prajāpati put Sraddha in truth and aśraddhā in falsehood, while in Vaj. S. 19.30, it is said that truth is obtained by sraddha, 

In the post-vedic Literature, Panini explains the forms 'śrāddhin' and 'srāddhika' in V. % 85, in the sense of 'one who has eaten a sraddha dinner' The word 'śrāddha' may be derived from sraddhā according to Pān, V.1.109 795. Sraddha is variously defined in the blüsya on Yogasūtra I 20, 'śraddha' is defined as the composure of the mind 7% (oi men tal approval). Devala defines sraddha: 'confidence (in the efficacy) of religious acts is called sraddhā, one who has 20 faith has no reason (or inotive) for engaging in religious acts ' 797. The Srāddbusūtra 798 of Katyāyana prescribes 'one endowed with śraddhā should offer sraddha even with vege tables (if nothing else is available)'. Vide Manu II. 275 which emphasizes sraddhā for the gratification of pitrs The Mārkandeyapurāna (29, 27 } emphasizag 799 the relation of śraddha to śraddha and states that what is offered at sraddbas becomes transformed into that kind of food for the use of the piers who require food in the new bodies they might have assu med according to the doctrina of karma and punarjanmi and it also remarks that srāddba offered with wealth acquired in an iinproper or unjust way is a means of gratification to the pitrs that are born as capdālas, pakkasas and similar very low grades of people.

It has already been stated above (pp. 349-350) that in very ancient times there were only three rites for departed ancestors, viz. Pinda-pito-Fajās (offered by those who had consecrated the stauts fires) or monthly šraddha in the case of those who had not done so (vide e. g. Āśy. Gr. II 5.10, Hir. GF, II. 10. 1, Āp. Gr. VIII. 21. 1. Visņuparāna II. 14. 3 &c.), the Mahāpiti ysjõa and the Astaka śrāddhes. The first two have been already described in vol. II (as said above), but the Astaka śrāddhas have not been described at all so far. Therefore some remarks will be offered here about ther. They are of special importance, but the suthorities present great variations on clmost all points such as the number of days and the months in which they were to be performed, the deities to be worshipped, the olierings to be made and the procedure to be followed. 

Gaut. (VII 19) mentions Aştaka' rite as the first among the SETED kinds of pakayajfas and as one of the forty saṁskāras. Aştaki sppears to have meant the 8th tithi in any month after the Full Moon day (vide Sat. Br. VI. 4.2.10). The Sat. Br. states so 'On the 8th day (after full moon) he (the performer of agricrayana) collects the materials for the fire pan, for sacred to Prajāpati is the Stib day (after full moon) and sacred to Prajapati is this rite viz. the firepan." Sabara in his Bhāşya on Jsi.S03 I 3.% cites a verse occurring in the A V. . 10. 2 and in the Ap. M. P. I. 20.27 as a mantra indicative of Aştaka. The mantra is "May that (Astaka) night be Fery suspicious for us, whom people welcome like a cow coming towards a person and which is the wife of the Year. In the A. V. III. 10. 8 the Ekastaki is said to have the year (Samvatsara ) as husband. The Tui. S. IL 4. 8. 1. provides 802 'Men about to take dikşi (cousecration) for & Samaisarasattra should undergo dikşā on the Ekastakü; what is called Ekastakā is the wife of the year.' Jai. (VI 5.3.-37) explains that Ekastakā is the 8th tithr after the Full Moon of Māgha. The Ap Gg. (quoted by Haradatta

According to the Asy, Gr. I, 4, 1 the Astakā days (and rites) were four, viz the 8th' tithis of the dark halves of the four months of the two seasons of hemanta and sissia (i. o of Mārgaśirsa, Pausa, Māgha and Phalguna). Mošt of the Grhiya siữas via Mahava Gr. T 8, Sān. Ga 11. 12 1, Khadira Gr. II. 3 27, Kathaka Gr. 61.1, Kaušitaki Gr. III, 15. 1 and Pār, Gr. TII. 3 say that there are only three Astakā rites viz, on the 8th after the Full Moon day of Mārgasirsa (called agrahāyani) i e. in the dark halves of Margašīřsa, Pausa (or Taisa) and Magha, The Gobhila Gr.

The Baud. Gr II. 11. 1 provides that the three Astakā homas are performed in the months of Taisa, Magha and Phālguna, ĀŠv. Gr II. 4.2 refers to an option that 'Astakā rites were performed only on one Astami (aad not on three or four). The Baud.

describes only, one Astakā rite viz. the "Ekāstakā in the dark half of. Magha. The Bhāradvāja Grhya II. 15 also speaks of only. Ekāstaka but adds that the 8th of the dark half of Māgha on which the moon is in Jyestha is called Ekāstaka. According to Hir. Gr. I. 14 and 15 the one Astaka extended over three days viz. 8th, 9th (on which a cowy was sacrificed for the pitys) and 10th (which, was the Anvaştakā). The Vaikhānasa-smārta sūtra (ed. by Caland) IV. 8 says that Astakā is to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Māgha and Bhadrapada or on the 7th, 9th or 10th tithi. 

There is divergence in the offerings also. The Kathaka Gr (61.S), Jaimini Gr. 2, 3 and San, Gr. (II. 12. 2) provide that on the three different Astakās the offerings are of cooked vegetables, flesh and apūpas (cakes), while the Pār, Gr. IIL 3 and Khadira Gr IIL. 3. 29-30 put apūpas for the first Aştaka (and hence Gobbila Gr. IIL 10. 9 designates it apupāstakā) and boiled vegetables on the last. According to Khādira Gr. II: 4. 1 a cow is sacrificed. According to ĀŠv. Gr. II, 4,7-10, Gobhila GI. IV. 1.18-22, Kaušika 138.%, Baud, Gr. IL 11, 51-61, on the Sth day very many options are given, viz, either to sacrifice a cow or a ram or a goat; or to offer some jungle flosk that may be available or flesh mixed with sesame and honey, or flesh of the rhinoceros, deer, buffalo, ram, boar, spotted deer, hare, Robita deer, pigeons, śārnga and other birds, or an old red goat; fishes or rice cooked in milk so as to form thin gruel, or gifts only of uncooked corn or fruits and roots, or gold may be offered or only grass for cows or oxep or ons may burn some thickets in a forest or present jars for holding water to those deeply learned in the Veda or should recite the mantras relating to sraddhas, saying 'this is the Astakā. I offer,' but one should not remain without observing the Astakā day in some such manner as the above 807

History of Dharmaśāstia 

[Vol. applied to a rite in which the pitrs are the deities Forshipped, the greatest divergence prevails as to the devatā of the Astakās, The AST Gr. (IL, 4.3 and I. 5. 3-5) provides that on the 7th of the dark half the offerings are made to the pilys and on the 9th also, but ĀŠv. I, 4, 12 refers to the eight options as regards the deity of the 8th day, viz Višve-derāh (all the gods ), Agni, Sürya, Prajāpati, Rātrī (night), Naksatras (constellations), the seasons, the Patrs, Pašus (cattle). The Gobhila Gr III, 10 1 starts 808 by saying that Night is the devatā of Astakā, but adds that there are other views about the deratā being Agni, the Pitts, Prajāpati, Rtus (seasons) or ]] Gods, 

The procedure of Astakā comprises three parts, riz, homa, inviting brāhmadas for dinner (up to seeing them go array after dinner) and the rite called Alyastakya or Anpastakā When the Astakās were deemed to be three or four performed in the several months noted above, all these were gone through at each Åstaka When the Astakā rite vas performed only in one month i. e, after the Full moon in Māgha, the above parts were performed on three days, 7th, 8th and 9th of the dark balf. When compressed in one day only, they must have been per formed one after another on the same day. 

Many of the Grhyasūtras, such as those of Āstalāgana, Kaušika, Gobhila, Hirapyakešin and Baudhāyana describe a very elaborate procedure in the case of Astakās One of the shortest being that contained in Āp. Gr. (VII 21 and 22 ) is given here by way of sample 508x After defining Ekāstakā ( in VII 21 10) Āp. proceeds: 'He (the performer of the Astakā rite) should perform subsidiary (or preparatory) rites in the evening of the previous day (i e, on the 7th of the dark half). He cooks (or bakes) a cake from rice taken up (from a heap) in four cups; according to some teachers the cake is prepared on eight potsherds (like a purodāśa) After the actions up to the

On the following day he prepares the cow for immolation by touch ing her with a darbha with the words 'I make thee that are agreeable to the Fathers ready (for sacrifice)'. Having silently (i, e, without uttering the word svākā ) offered five 812 oblations of clarified butter, having cooked the omentum of that (cow) and having spread under (the cooked omentum) and sprinkled over it clarified butter he offers it with a palaba leaf from the middle or the end of the stalk with the next verge (i e.

He offers the food of flour cooked (in milk) with the next verse (Āp. M P.

The rites from Svistakrt 815 down to the placing of the pindas are the same as at the monthly śrāddha (described in Āp. Gr. VIII 21, 1-9). Some teachers prescribe that the pindas are to be offered the day after the Astakā (i. e, on the 9th of the dark half). Here follows another method (of celebrating the Astakā rite ). He sacrifices ourds with his joined hands in the same way as he offers the cake. Having left over from the meat (of the cow) as much as may be required, he performs on the day following

(the. Astakā day) the Anvastakā rite Ita procedure is explain ed by the description of the monthly śrāddha. 

Though Ap. Gr. (II. 5 3) and San. Gr. III, 13, ņ state that the Anvastakya rite follows the procedure of Pindapitryajāa, some Grhyasūtras (such as Khādira II, 5, Gobhila IV 2-3) give very elaborate descriptions of that rife. The Asy. Gr. and Vispudharmasūtra 74 follow a middle course. The description in Ašv. Gr, is comparatively brief and it is set out below. It may be noted that some Grhya-sütras state that the Anvastakya rite is performed on the 9th or 10th of the dark half (eg, Khadira Gr III, 5. 1 'navamim daśamim Vānvastakyam)". Further, it may be stated that though most Grhyasūtras call the rite Anyastakya still it is also called, Anvastaka by Pār, Gr. IIL 3, 10, Manu IV, 150, Visnudharmasūtra 74.1 and 76. 1. The most notable peculiarity of this rite is that therein female ancestors are iupoked and offerings are made to them of which Jiquor (sura), scum of boiled rice, collyrium, salves and garlands form part. Though some gūtras (like Āøv. Gr. II. 5) declare that the Astakā and Anvastakya are modelled on the monthly śrāddha or Pindapitryaiña, others (like the Baud, Gr. III. 12, 1, Gobhila Gą. IV. 4., Khadira ILL. 5, 35) say that the Astakā or Anvastakya is the norm which is followed in the Pindapitryajia and all the sraddhas. The Kathaka Gr. (66, 1, 67, 1, 68, 1. 69, 1) averg 816 that the first śraddha, the other śrāddhas (such as gapindikarana), Pašušrāddha (in wbich the flesh of an animal is offered) and the śrāddha performed every month follow the procedure of Astakā. The Pinda-pitryajña could be offered on anlāvāsyā only by one who was āhitāgni (i. e. had kept the sacred vedic fires). It is impossible to believe that everyone became āhitāgai. The case was probably the reverse i, e. only a few became āhitāgnis and the rest had only the grbya fira or many of the rest were without even the grhya fire. It appears possible that all were required to offer śrāddha on amātāsyā on the analogy of pindapitryajia. As the latter became rare, the requirement of offering srāddha on amāvagyā remained and in the gūtras and smrtis all the details were mentioned under māsiśrāddha and in the case of the other frāddhas the sūtras and smrtis pointed out only what was to bs omitted. It is owing to this that the māgißraddha came to be called the prakrti and the other śrāddhas were called vilries

The Ancaştakya śrāddha or variations of the māsisrāddha. Most of the details of the pindapitryajia were required in māsišrāddha and a few (such as giving arghya, gandha, dipa) were added and more elaborate rules evolved. 

The Anyastakya817 is described in the Asy, Gr. (II. 5. 2-15) as follows Having prepared a portion of the same meat,818 having established the fire on a surface sloping towards the south, havióg fenced it in and made a door on the north side of the enclosed shed, having strewn round the fire three times sacrificial grass with its roots without touching it, turning the left side (of one's body) towards the fire, he should place down the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice mixed with sesamum, rice cooked in milk, meal pap with curds and meal pap with honey. The ceremony should follow the ritual of the Pindapitryajia (vide Ašv. Śr. II. 6). Having sacrificed (part of the foods spacified except meal-pap) with honey let him offer portions of those substances to the pults and to their wives with the addition of liquor and the scum of boiled rice. Some place the portion to be offered into pits, which may be two or six. In those situated to the east he should present the offerings to the pitrs; in those to the west, to the wires. Thereby the cere mony celebrated in the rainy season on the Maghā day in the dark fortnight after the full moon of Prausthapada (i. e. Bhadrapada) has been declared. And thus he should offer (a festival like the Anvastakā ) to the pitts every month, obsery. ing uneven 819 numbers. · He should give food at least to nine (brahmanas) or to any un-aven number of brāhmanas. (Food should be given) to an even number on auspicious occasions 820

or on the performance of meritorious deeds; to an uneven number (on other occasions). The rite is performed from left to right. Barley grains are to be used instead of sesamum. 

The Anvastakya rite was performed after each of the three or four Astakās and if only one Astakā in Māgha were perform ed, then after the 8th of the dark half. 

Thiere are two views about the rite called Māghyāvarsa 821 in Asv. Gr. II, 5. 9. Aoc, to Nārāyada, the rite is performed in the dark half of Bhadrapada for three days on 7th, 8th and 9th.822 The other view is that it is a rite like the Astakās but performed on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapada, when generally the moon is in the Maglā naksıtra. There is doubt about the very name of the site, as the mss. present various forms (vide Oldenberg's note in S. B. E. vol. 29. p 103 on San, Gr. III, 13 1). The real name appears to be Maghyāvarsa, or Moghāvarsa (meaning 'a śrāddha in the rainy season when the moon is in the Maghā naksatı a)'. The Visdu Dh. S 76 1 823 mentions the following times for offering śrāddha viz, (twelve) Amāyāsyās (in a year), the three Astakās, the three Anvastakās, the 13th of the dark balf of Bhādrapada when the moon is in the Maghā asterism, the seasons of sarad and rasanta. In Visnu Dh. S. 178. 52-53) also a śrāddha on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada is highly eulogised Manu III, 273 also states that whatever food mixed with honey is offered on the 13th day in the rainy season when the moon is in Maghā procures endless qatisfaction, To the same effect are Vas XI 40 (in the rainy season and on Magha), Yāj I 26 and Varāhapurāda, 824 In the

Hir. Gr. . 13, 3. (edited by Kirste) the name appears to be Madhyāvarsa 825 and it is provided that meat is obligatory in it, but that if meat cannot be had then vegetables may be offered. In Pār. 826 Gr. (II. 3) the name (as printed) is madhyāvarsa which is said to be a 4th Astakā in wbich only vegetables are offered. Apararka (p. 422) also appears to call the rite 'madhya varsa. In the Bhavisyapurāna 877 (Brahma-parya), chap. 183, 4 also this rite is referred to but it is said that therein meat is to be offered. It appears probable that this ancient rite on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapads is a precursor of the Mahālayaśraddha of later times, 

If Asyalāyana's view, viz, that there are four Astakās in Hemanta and stśira, were followed and if the Maghyavarsa śrāddha were to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Bhadrapada as Nārāyana holds, then there would be five Astakās in all. Bhattoji in his Caturpimsatimatagangraha says so.823 

Considerations of space forbid the comparison of the above procedure from Ap. Gr. and ĀśY, Gr. with the procedure described in the other Grhyasūtras. It should be noted that several of the sūtras often employ the same mantras in the various stages of the rite (as pointed out above in notes 813-814). 

It must be said that the Astakā śrāddhas gradually fell into oblivion and are not performed now.

which the Astakās and other śrāddhas were copies (vikriis ) with suitable modifications, though a few dissident texts reverse the position, 

In the Gobhilagrhya (IV. 4, 3 ff) another sraddha called 'Anvāhārya' is prescribed after the Pindapitryajõa on the same day. The Sān, Gr. IV. 1. 13 appears also to describe the monthly stāddha as distinct from the Pindapitryajña. Manu (III.122-23) states: 'After performing the Patryajña (i, o, pindapitryajña) a brāhmana who keeps sacred fires shall offer every month on the amavāsyā day the funeral sacrifice Pindanvāhāryaka, 829 The wise call the monthly offering to the Manes Auvābārya and that must be carefully performed with the approved kinds öf flesh mentioned below.' From this it appears that one who has consecrated the frauta fires (i, e. an āhitāgni) was to perform the pindapiryajita in the srauta fires and also perform the same day another sraddha after the pindapitryajña, while those who had not consecrated srauta fires were to perform on amāvāsyā a śrāddha in the grhya 'fire, which was called pipdanyābār yaka or simply apvāhārya and also were to offer pipdapitre yajña in smārta fire (vide Sat. Srauta II, 7, 64 'grhyāgnau anāhitāgneh?). From inquiries made I learn that nowadays most Agnihotrins (at least in the Deccan) do not perform Pinda pitryajõa at all or perform it only once a year and that no one performs the Pindānvāhāryaka śrāddha. It is further to be noted that in smārta yajñas' no one now sacrifices an animal but employs instead māsa grain and there are ahstāgnis who do not offer meat in srauta sacrifices also, but only pista-pasu (an effigy of an animal made of flour). 

The literature on śrāddha is enormous in extent. From the Vedic Sambitās several thousand years ago up to medieval and modern commentaries and digests the various matters connect ed with śrāddha have been dealt with in more or less detail. The Purānas contain thousands of verses on śrāddha. An

adequate and thorough treatment of all this vast mass would fill a separate volume, but considerations of space forbid such an attempt here. All that can be attempted here at the most (and that too not in all cases) is to present matters chronologi cally i. e, describe how śrāddha was dealt with in the Saṁhitās and Brāhmana texts, then in the comparatively older Gshya and Dharma sūtras, then in such early startis as those of Manu and Yāj., then in some representative Puradas, then in the early commentaries of Medhātithi, Vijñāneśvara and Aparārka, and then in the medieval digests. Even in this way only a skeleton of the ceremonies described in some representative work of each class can be exhibited. Many differences of detail which arose owing to lapse of time, the locality, the sakha and usages of each writer, his individual inclination and his ability, will have to be passed over altogether. In the days of the Purāpas the differences in detail in the several sākhās have been adverted to.829a Apart from the smrtis and passages of the Mahābhārata (such as Anušāsana chap. 87-92) and com montaries on the Sūtras, on Manu, Yāj. and other smptis, the digests on śrāddha are legion, Only the following digests (arranged in chronological order) have been laid under contri bution in this volume: Kalpataru on śrāddha; the Hāralatā and Pitrdayitā of Aniruddha; the Smrtyarthasāra; the Smrticandrikā; the Caturvargacintāmani (section on śrāddha) of emādri (which in the B. I, edition covers 1716 pages); the Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara; the Madanapārijāta ; the Srāddhasāra (a part of Nrsimhaprasāda); Śrāddhakriya-kaumudi of Govindā.Danda; the Srāddhatattva of Raghunandana ; the Śrāddhagaukhya (part of Todarānanda); the Srāddhakalpalatā of Vinayaka alias Nandapandita; the Nirpayasindhu; the Śzāddhamayükha of Nilakantha; the Śrāddhaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); the Śrāddhacandrikā of Divākarabhatta ; the Smrtimuktāphala (on śrāddha); the Dharmasindhu; the Bālambhatti, a commentary on the Mitāksarā, While presenting this exhaustive and hetero. geneous material, some generalisations, when called for, will be made here and there. It will be seen later on how several minor matters such as whether food should be offered to gods before sraddha, definitions of words like pariritti, visalipati increased the extent of treatises on srāddha,

History of Dharmałāstra 

(Vol. 

We should now turn to the several matters relating to šrāddhas, 

First comes the question as to who are entitled to offer šrāddha (šrāddhādhikarin) This matter has been already dealt with in the E, of Dh, vol. IIL Y 739 ff., and on page 763 and od pp. 256-261 (notes 581-588) above. It would be noticed that some (like the Visņudharmasūtra ) prescribe that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased should ofīer prindas (i, e. per form sraddha for him), while others said that whoever was preferable as entitled to offer pindas to the deceased propositus was to take the wealth. A few matters not mentioned there may be added here. In the Santiparva 65, 13-21 it is narrated83a that emperor Māndhat was told by Indra bow Yaradas, Kiratas and similar non-Aryan peoples (that are styled Dasyus in the Epic) are to be made to conduct themselves and it is stated that all dasyus may perform Pitryajñas (in which they should feed men of their own kind and make monetary gifts to them) aod offer money to brāhmanas also, The Vāyuporāda (83. 112) also speaks of the Mlecchas as persons that offer oblations to Pitys. The general rule is stated by the Gobhila smrti 61 that the husband should not offer pipda to his wife even if she dies sonless, nor a father to his son por an elder brother to a younger brother. The moral of the story of Nini trho performed śrāddha for his predeceased son and repented for having done so as it was dharmasankara is the same, Vide Anušāsanaparra 91, Apararka (p. 538) quotes a verse from Şaţtrimóśan-mata that a father should not perform the śrāddha of his son Ror an elder brother of a younger one, But Brhat parāśara (p. 153) appears to state that even this general rule may have to be set aside sometimes. Baudhāyana and Viddhaśātātapa lg by Sm, C. op śrāddha p. 337) allow a śrāddha (except sapiņdikarada) to be performed by any one for any

relative through affection, particularly at Gayā. It is emphas ized 832 that he alone deserves to be called putra, who, while the father is alive, obeys his words, and gives plenty of food (to brāhmanas) every year (after his father's death) and who offers pindas (to his ancestors) at Gayā. The general rule laid down was that a child, whose upanayana has not been performed, is like a šūdra and lacks authority to utter Vedio passages (vide Ap. Dr. S. II, 6, 15. 19, Gaut. II, 4-5, Vas. II 6, Visou Dh. S. 28. 40, Manu II. 172),833 But an exception was recognized by almost all these authorities that a son, though his upanayana may not have been performed, can repeat the Vedic mantras required in funeral rites. Medhatithi on Manu L 172 explains that a minor son, even though not initiated into Vedic study by upanayana, can offer water to his father, perform the navašrāddhas (mentioned above in n. 593) and repeat such mantras as "Sundhantām pitaraḥ' required in these rites, but since he has no srauta or grluya fire of his own he can not per form such śrāddhas as the pārvana. The Smṛtyarthasāra (p. 56) provides that boys whose upanayana has not been per formed, women and sūdras should get śrāddhas performed through a priest or they may themselves perform them without mantras but only mention the name and gotra of the deceased Or with the two mantras 'devebhyo namah' and 'pitrbhyaḥ svadha mamah'. The above discussion shows that men and women, adults as well as children, those who are upanīta as well as those that are anupanīta are under an obligation to per form śrāddha.

Tai. S. 1. 8. 5. 1, Tai, Br, I. 6.9 (which will be quoted later on) show that śrāddha was offered to three immediate ancestors, father, grand-father, great-grand-father. The Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5. 113-115) states that there is a group of seven persons closely knit together that is called avibhaktadaya sapindas viz, great-grand-father, grand-father, father, the man himself (who

Therefore when Manu (IX. 106 ) says that by the birth of a son a man discharges his dobt to his progenitors the Diyabhāga (XI, 34) explains that the word putra stands for the three descendants up to the great grandson, since all the thrbe are entitled to perform the pār vapa-śrāddha and equally benefit the ancestors by the pindas they offer, and that the word putra is not to be taken literally but only as illustrative in order to include the great-grandson, since one may with difficulty find & text expressly mentioning tho adlıkūra of the grandson (as a performer of grāddha and taker of wealth) but there is no text expressly mentioning the great-grandson separately (as the taker of wealth and giver of pinda) 836 On Yāj. . 50 which lays down that when the father dies or has gone to a distant country or is overwhelmed by calamities (incurable diseases or the like) bis debts should be paid by the sons or grandsons, the Mit, adds that even when a son or grandson receives no ancestral property the father's debts must be paid, the only difference being that the son has to pay the principal as well as the interest, while the grandson

has to return only the principal and has to pay no interest and the Mit. quotes & Terge of Brhaspati 87 where all the three descendants are mentioned in one breath and the Mit, adds that the great-grandson has not to pay even the principal if he has received no ancestral property. This last remark implies that tho Mit. regarded that the great-grandson was also included in the extended sense of 'putra'. Yāj. I, 51 begins by saying that whoever takes the wealth of a deceased person has to pay the latter's debts, so the great-grandson would have to pay the great-grand-father's debts if he received the agsets of the grand-father. Therefore the Mit, on II, 50 expressly mentions that a great-grandson need not pay his great-grand-father's debts if he received no assets, because, otherwise being included in the extended meaning of putra, he would have had to pay. There was no necessity to bring in or mention the prapautra under II, 50 if the Mit, did not include the prapautra in the word putra. Again on Yāj. II, 51 ('putrahinasya rikthinah') the Mit. included even prapautra under the word pittra. This shows that the Mit. is quite conscious that the three descendants of a man form one group and succeed to his estate and liabilities and putra includes three descendants wherever the context so requires. If the word 'putra' is not to be taken as only illustrative and as including both grandson and great-grandson, sérious difficulties will arise even in the interpretation of Yaj. on which the Mit. comments. For example, in Yāj. II. 135-136 it is said that when a gonless man dies his wife, daughters and other heirs (named there ) succeed one after another. If 'putra' is taken to mean only 'son' and no one else, then on the death of a man without a son his wife or daughter (whoever is alive) will take the wealth oven if a son's son exists. But that would be absurd and is not stated by any one. Therefore the word putra has to be interpreted in a wider sense in a proper context. Many works such as the Vyavahāramayūkha, the Viramitrodaya, the Dattakamimānsā interpret the word 'putra' as including three generations. Therefore, though the Mit, in its remarks on inheritance and succession expressly names the son and grand

son only (lit, it should have mentioned only the gon) it must by takon as including tho great-grandson also, particularly iz view of tho fact that it rofors to the great-grandson in its commont on Yaj. I, 50 and 51 as taking the riktha which thi Mit. (on Yaj. II. 114) interprets as aptratibandha daya. Baud Manu, Yajneralkya spoak of the three descendants and Sankha likhita, Vas, XI. 39 and Yama employ 538 only the word putra or sula in rolation to the three ancestors. Therefore, the remark of Dr, Kapadin in Hindu Kinship' on p. 162 "Vijñāne. svara understands by the word putra song and grandsons only is unjustified. It is impossible to hold with Dr. Kapadia that the Mit, ran counter to the express dicta of renowned Spartis such as those of Manu, Sankha-Likhita and Purānas like the Visnu-purina III. 13,30 (quoted above in note 582) and that in its romarks on succession it forgot its own interpretation of putra on Yaj. II. 51. He has also not correctly understood the words of the Mit. introducing Yhj. IL 137: sons and grandsons take the wealth; in thoir absonce, the wife and others; thus it is soid (by mo). This is wrong for several reasons. "Wife and othors take the wealth' is said by YĀJ. (in II. 135-36). The following words aro 'now (the author) declares an exception to both.' This clearly refers to Yaj. (II. 137) and not to Vijñāne øvera and Bo Suktam' algo must refer to Yāj. and not to Vijñānospora. Therefore, according to the Mit, the great-grand son is included in the extended meaning of the word 'putra', is entitled just like a son or a grandson to offer sraddha (in default of a son or grandson ) and to take the wealth and pay the debts of the ancestor. In the matter of payment of debts there ia, on account of the difference in the period that slapses, & difference between all the three descendants if no ancestral wealth is left by the ancestor, viz. the son pays the debt with interest, the grandson only the principal lent but without interest and the great-grandson nothing at all. This shows that even between the son and the grandson that are expressly mentioned by Yā), II. 50 as to the payment of debts there is a difference and that as the great-grandson had to pay nothing when no ancestral property existed he was not mentioned at all in Yā).

Times for sraddhas 

Just as the king is an ultimate heir and also the guardian of all minors, 80 he is like the son of a person (who has no relatives left) for performing sraddhas 

The nest question is about the times when sraddha is to be performed. It has been seen above (vide H. of Dh. Yol, IT. P. 696 ff) that long before the time of the Sat. Br. five daily observances (called Mahāyajñas) were prescribed for each house-bolder, viz the sacrifice to beings, that to men, that to the Fathers, that to the gods and that to Veda 

The Sat. Br. and the Tai, ā, (I. 10) say further that this daily rite in which one offers suadhā (food) to the Fathers even up to water was called pitryaisia. Manu III. 70 defines Pitryajña as tarpana (satiating ancestors with the offerings of water). Manu II, 82 provides that an householder, should daily perform a śrāddha with food or with water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus please the Fathers. Sraddha originally meant & sacrifice performed for the Fathers on Amārāsyā (vide Gaut, 15. 1-2 ).838a By applying that word to the daily offering of water to the Manes what is intended to be conveyed is that the special characteristics of śrāddha in the strict sense are to be extended to this daily rite so far as possible. Amāvāsyā is of two kinds, Sinivāli and Kuhū, Those who keep śrauta fires should perform śrāddha on the former, while those who have not kept srauta fires and sūdras should offer śrāddha on the latter, 

Srāddhas are divided into three classes, nitya, naimitteka and kānya. An observance is called nitya when it is laid down that it must be performed on a certain or fixed occasion ( such as every day, on an amāvāsyā, or on Astakā day). What is laid down for being done on an occasion which is uncertain is celled naimiitika ( such as the birth of a son). What is ordained to be done in case one desires a certain reward or fruit is called hāmija (e. g. the performance of a sraddha on Krttikā or Rohini by one who desires heaven or progeny ). The five daily yaljas including pitr-yajña are nitya i, e, they must be per formed without any eye to any reward therefrom and the

non-performance thereof will lead to sinfulness. Passages mentioning the rewards that follow from the performance of obligatory (nitya) rites are only laudatory, they only convey that such performances make a man pure, but it is not meant that they are not obligatory and may be performed only if a person desires the rewards or results promised (i. 8. Such performances are not kūmya). Ap. Dh. S. (II. 7. 16. 4-7) provides certain times for the performance of śrāddha viz, that it must be performed in the latter half of every month, that the afternoon is preferable for it, that the last days of the latter half of each month are preferable to the first days of the latter half. Gaut. 15. 3 and Vas. XI, 16 say that śrāddha may be performed on any day of the dark half of a month after the 4th day and Gaut. 15. 5 adds that if particularly appro priate materials or particularly holy brahmanas are available or the performer is near a very sacred place (such as Gaya) a śrāddha may be performed on any day. Kūrma (II. 20 23) says the same thing. The Agnipurāna 115. 8 says that at Gayā a ārāddha may be performed on any day (na kālādi Gayātīrthe dadyāt pindāmsca nityaśaḥ). Manu (III. 276-278) provides that the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the 10th but excepting the 14th 8386 ara recommended for sraddha, that one performing a śrāddha on even lunar days (i. a, on the 10th, 12th) and on the even naksatras '(i. e. on Bharadi, Rohini &o.) gains the fulfilment of all his desires, that one who worships the Manes on uneven days (11th, 13th &c) and on uneven constellations (Krttikā, Mrgaśiras &c) obtains PIQ sperous offspring and that just as the latter half of a month is

This only means that śrāddha should not be performed for anyone on the 14th of the dark halt except for those who were killed by poison or by beasts, spakes, lower animals or brāhmanas or in battle Bata srāddba may be performed on aoy tiths of the dark balf for those killed in battle or by poisOD &c. It should be noted that Mand prescribes (III. 282) that ap āhitāgai should not perform a sraddha except on darśa, from which it follows that only others (who had no srauta fres) could offer sraddha on any day of the dark half. Vide FiraTE VI. 204, 24-27 And VI 219 19-21 for the proposition that saidba should be performed on the 14th tithi of the dark half of Bhadrapada for those who met a violent death by poisoning or fire or were killed by animals having fangs or horns or sho committed suicide.

(I. 217-218), the Kūrma (II 20.2-8), Mārkandeya (28. 20 ff) and Varāhapurana 13. 33-35 sum up in one place the times for performing śrāddhas as follows: Amāvāsyā, the Astakā days, lucky days (such as the birth of a son), dark half of a month, the two ajanas (the two days on which the sun appears to start towards the south or north i e. solstices), possession of sufficient materials (such as rice and pulse or meat), the arrival of a worthy brahmapa, the equinoctial points (visuvat, i, e. the sun's apparent en 'trance into Aries and Balance), the days on which the sun passes into one rāśt from another, the astrological conjunctions called Vyatipāta 838€, Gajacchāyā, eclipses of the sun and the *moon, when the performer has an intense desire to perform

[ Vol. deya 8384 (chap. 28. 22-23), adds that śrāddha should be perforni ed when a man dreams an evil dream and when evil planets affect the naksatra of his birth. In an eclipse the appropriate time for śrāddha is what is called Sparsa Kala 839 (i e, when the eclipse begins), as stated in a verse of Vrddha-Vasistha. The Brahmapurāpa (220. 51-54) contains all the times specified by Yāj, and a few more. Vide also Skandapurāna VII. 1. 30-3%, Visnupurāna TI, 14, 4-6, Padma (srsti 9. 128-129). Acc. to Visou Dh. 8.76.1-2, Amāvāsya, the three Astakās and the three Anvastakās, the 13th day of the dark half of Bhadrapada on which the moon is in Maghā, Sarad and Vasanta are obliga tory (mutya) times for sraddha and that if a person does not per form śrāddha on these days he goes to Hell. Visnu Dh. S.(77,1-7) states that the day of the sun's passage from one sign of the zo diac to another, the two equinoctial days, particularly the sols ticia) days, Vyatipāta, the constellation on which the performer is born, a time of rejoicing (son's birth or the like)--these are Icāmya times and a śrāddha performed on these occasions gives infinite pleasure (to the Manes). The Kūrmapurāna (Uttarārdla 16. 6-8) says that śrāddhas called kānya are commended on eclipses, solstice days, equinoctial days and on Vyatipate and they give infinite pleasure (to the Manes) and śrāddha per formed on-Sankranti (sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac to another) is inexhaustible and so also on days of birth and on the several naksatras śrāddhas should be performed. Āp. Dh, S. II. 7. 16. 8-22, Anusāgana 87, Vāyu 89. 10-19, Yāj I 262-263, Brahmapurāna 220.15-21, Visnu Dk. 8.78.36-50, Kūrmapurāna (IL 20.17-22), Brahmānda II. 17.10-22 state what rewards & man gats if he performs śrāddhas on each of the days from the first to the 15th of the dark half These lists do not completely agree with each other. That of Ap. being probably the most ancient, is set out hereSrāddha performed on each of the 15 days of the dark half respectively yields the following results in order, viz. progeny chiefly consisting of females (on 1st tithi

Amāvāsyā). Gārgya (a by Par. M, I. 2 p. 324) provides that one should not perform śrāddha on Nandā, on Friday, on 13th of the dark half and on the naksatte of birth and the preceding and the following naksatras for fear of losing one's sons and wealth. The Napdā tithis are 1st, 6th and 11th. The Anušāsana-parya (87.16) provides that he who performs brāddha on the 13th tithi attains pre-eminence among his agnates, but then the young men in his house die as a consequence. 

The sraddhas performed on the days mentioned in Visnu Dk. S. 77. 1-6 are naimittaka and those performed on certain tulhes and days of the week for securing certain rewards would be kāmija śrāddhas, According to Par M. I. 1 p. 63 the per formance of obligatory (nitya) actions is samskāraka (i a, offects a purifying change in the mind making it fit for higher things ), while in some cases it may also produce the desire to know the Reality bebind the appearances (i e, it is 'vividisā janaka' as indicated by the Gstā 9, 27). Jaimini (VI. 3. 1-7) establishes the proposition that the nitya acts (such as Agni hotra, Darśa-pürnamāsa-yāga) must be performed even though the performer is unable to perform a subsidiary part of the rite; while Jai, VI. 3. 8-10 provide that every part of Kamyu actions must be performed and if the performer thinks that he would be unable to perform all he should not undertake to perform a kāmya rite at all. 839a

The Visnu-Dharmasutra (78. 8-15 ) mentions what rewards follow from performance of śrāddhas on the 28 naksatras from Krttikā to Bharani (including Abhijit which is placed after Uttarāsādha and before Sravana). Yāj I 265–268, Vāyu chap. 82, Mārkaddeya-purada 30, 8-16, Kürma (II. 20 9-15), Brahmapurāda 220, 33-42, Brahmānda ( Upodghātapāda 18.1 ff) also deal with the same topic, but all these works do not present complete agreement For example, Visnu Dh S. and Yāj. agree that śrāddha performed on Krttikā, Rohini, Asyini and Bharapı yield as rewards heaven, offspring, horses and longe vity, but they disagree in several others e. g. while Vispu says that prosperity, beauty (or happiness ) and all desires are obtained by performing śrāddha on the Pusya, Aślesā, and Magbā naksatras respectively, Yā), provides that a śrāddha on these three yields strength, son and eminence. The Anu šāsanaparya 89 and Vayupurāda 82 set out the rewards of srāddhas on the several naksatras from Krttikā as declared by Yama to Sasabindu. 

It is stated in the Agnipurāna 840 that srāddbas performed at a holy place and on days that are called Yugādı and Man vādi yield inexhaustible gratification (to the pritrs) The Vispupurāna 641, Matsyapurāna (17. 4-5), Padma V, 9. 130-131, Varahapurāpa and Prajāpati-smrti verse 22 and Skanda VII 1. 205 33-34 state that the third tithi of Vaisakha (bright halt), the 9th of the bright half of Kārtika, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada and 15th tithi of the dark half of Māgha are called Yugādi tithes (ie the first days of the four Yugas from Krła).

Vispu Dh, S. declares that śrāddha performed during an eclipse satisfies the Manes as long as the moon and stars exist and brings to the performer all advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires, while the Kūrmapurāpa threatens that he who would not perform & śrāddba in an eclipse sinks (inours sins or becomes ruined) as a cow in mud, The Mit. on Yā). I, 217 is careful to point out that though there is a prohibition against eating during the progress of an eclipse of the sun or moon, that prohibition would only affect the eater (the brāhmapa who eats śrāddha repast in an eclipge) but not the giver who will secure happiness (or good results) thereby.843

History of Dharnatāstra 

[Vol. Very learned disquisitions are held in Aparārka p. 465 ff, Hemādri p. 313 ff and other writers and digests as to the mean ing of aparāhna which is the time for sraddha prescribed by Manu (III. 278). There are sevoral views. Some hold that the part of the day after noon is 'after-noon.' The word 'pūrvahna' occurs in Rg. X. 34. 11. Others relying on a śruti 84 text * The forenoon is for gods, mid-day for men and afternoon for pitrs' hold that the third part of the day divided into three parts is 'aparāhva. A third view is that aparāhga is the 4th part of the day divided into five parts and they rely 845 on Sat. Br. 11, 2.3 9. The five parts are called prātah, sangava, madhyandına (or madhyāhpa), aparāhna and sāyāhng (or sayam or astagamana). The first three are expressly mentioned even in the Rgveda V. 76.3 Prajāpati-smrti (verses 156-157) says that each of these five parts extends over three muhur tas (the day being divided into fifteen muhūrtas). It further states that hutapa is the 8th muhūrta from sunrise and that śrāddha should be begun in kutapa and should not last beyond Rauhida muhurta and that five muhurtas (from 8th to 12th) are the maximum time for śrāddha, 846 The word kutapa has eight meanings as noted by tle Sr. C. (śrāddha) p. 433 and Hemādri on śrāddha p. 320. The word is derived from 'ku' meaning "condemned' (i. e, sin) and 'tapa' means 'what burns. The eight 47 meanings of 'kutapa' are 'midday, a vessel of rhinoceros horn, woollen seat or blanket

The general rule is that śrāddhas are performed in the afternoon (but this applies to śrāddha on New mooni, Mahālaya, Astakā and Anyastakā śrāddhas ), while Vrddhisraddha and śrāddha in wliich only corn is offered (āmasraddha ) are performed in the inorning. Medhatithi on Manu III, 245 quotes a smrti text on this 848 The Trikāpdamandana (II. 150, 162) provides that when it is not possible to perform a religious rite at the time prescribed for it as appropriate, it should be performed at some other time thereafter and that, between the proper time of a rite and the means, the former is to be preferred and one should not wait for a time later than the proper one with the desire of being able to collect all the principal materials. 848a 

A few words must be said about the proper places for the performance of a śrāddba. Manu (III 206-207 ) lays down that the performer should make efforts to secure a spot sloping to the south and smear it with cowdung, a spot that is pare and unfrequented (by many persons) and that the Fathers are pleased by grāddha at naturally clean spots or the banks of rivers and spots that are unfrequented. Yāj. I. 227 very briefly puts the requirements by saying that the place of śrāddha should be covered on all sides, should be pure and sloping to the south. Sankha says : 849 'one should not perform śrāddha on the backs of bulls, elephants and horses, nor on raised earth platforms nor on land owned by others' The Kūrmapurāna states 850 'Forests, sacred mountains, holy places, temples—these have no (definite) owner and they cannot be private property (of any one ), Yama provides 851 'if one offers śrāddba to his petrs in spots

belonging to others, that śrāddha rite is destroyed by the pitrs of the owner of those spots. Therefore, & man should perform grāddha on holy spots, on river banks, in sacred places and particularly in land belonging to himself, in bowers near hills and on mountain tops' The Vishudharma-sūtra chap 85 mentions numerous holy places and then adds 'in these and other ti thas, big rivers, on all natural sandy banks, near streams, on mountains, in bowers, forests, groves and spots that look charming because of being smeared with covdung (śrāddha may be performed )' Sankha (14 27–29 ) states

The Brahmapurāna ( 220.5-7) also specifies river banks, lakes, mountain tops, sacred spots like Puskara as the proper places for śrāddha. The Vāyupurāna, chap 77 and Matsya 22 contain Jong lists of sacred places, countries, moun tains in relation to srāddhas. The Kalpataru (śrāddha p. 40) and Sr. P. p. 147 state that special characteristics of the tirthas in the several countries that are declared to be fit places for srāddha should be understood from the inhabitants of those various countries. 

Sacred places will be dealt with in a separate section (on tin thas). 

The Vispudharmasūtra 852 ( chap 84 ) prescribes that ślāddha should not be performed in Mleccha country, nor should one go to & Mleccha country and then defines a Mleccha country as one in which the system of the four varnas is not established and states that Āryāvarta is beyond that The Vāyupurāna provides 883 that the country of Trišanku sluch 18

Magadha ) is not fit for śrāddha, similarly the countries called Kāraskara, Kalinga, the country to the north of the river Sindhu and all countries where the system of varnas and āśramas is not in existence should be sedulously avoided for śrāddhas, The Brahmapurāpa (220.8-10) makes the somewhat startling remark that the following countries should be avoided for śrāddhas viz, the Kirāta country, Kalinga, Konkapa, Krimi (Krivi?), Dašarpa, Kumārya (Cape Comorin), Tangapa, Kratba, tlie northern banks of the Sindhu river and the south bank of Narmada and the east of the Karatogā, 

The Mārkandeyapurāna 854 prescribes that for a šrāddla a place (ground) that is full of insects, that is arid, or is burnt by fire, from which proceed sounds that are painful to the ear, that is terrific in its aspect, that omits fetid smell should be avoided, 

It was also provided from very early times that certain persons and animals are to be ejected from the place where srāddha is to be performed and are not to be allowed to polluto tlie śrāddha rite by looking at it or by disturbing it in various other ways. Gaut. (15. 25-28) provides that food seen by dogs, cāndalas and those guilty of mahāpātakas becomes unclean (and so unfit); therefore one should offer śrāddha in a covered (or screened) place; or he should strew round about the place sesame or a worthy brāhmana who purifies a row of diners by liis presence should perform a śānti for removing the taint caused by a dog or cāndāla seeing the food &c). Āp. Dh. S, prescribes that the learned condemn the seeing of a śrāddba by dogs and those who (being patta) are excommunicated and that a leper, a bald man, one having sexual intercourse with another's wife, the son of a brāhmapa who follows the profes sion of arms, the son of a brāhmana wonan from a sūdra man if these eat śrāddha food they pollute the diners sitting to eat in a row, Manu ( II. 239-242) states : 'a candāla, a village pig or cock, a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, an impotent person-these should not be allowed to see brāhmanas engaged in taking dinner, Whatever is seen by these at a homa

Having eleven or nine fingers &c.), be sliould be ejected from the place where šrāddha is to be per formod. It is provided by the Anušāsanaparva (127.13) that śrāddha food should not be seen by a woman in her monthly illness or by a sonless woman or by one suffering fron white leprosy. Vispu-dharnasūtra (82, 3 ff) contains a long list of about 30 persons who are not to be allowed near a śrāddlio, The Kūrmapurina (II. 22, 34-35) states that one devoid of a limb, & patila, a leper, one suffering from an open ulcer, an atleist, a cock, a pig, a dog, should be kept far away from a śraddha; one should also avoid one that has a disgusting appearance, an impure person, one who is naked, a mad man, a gambler, a woman in her nonthly course, those that wear indigo-coloured or yellow-red garments and those wbo follow heretical views. The Mārkandeya 32 20-24, Vayu 78. 26-40, Visnupurāpa III, 16. 12-14 and Adušāsanaparva 91 43-44 also contain long lists which are passed over here. The Skanda purāna VI 217, 43 also speaks about a dog, a woman in her inonthly illness, a patita and a hog not being allowed to see the grāddha rito. 

The classification of Sraddhas. Sraddhas have been variously classified. One classification, viz, into nutya, nazmıttrica and Lamya has already been desoribed above (p. 369) Another classification is that into Ekoddista and Pāryana 855. The first is offered to one deceased person alone, while the latter is performed on the amāvāsyā of a montlı or in the dark half of Bhadrapada or on sankrānti and in it the three paternal ancestors are principally invoked.

The Sraddhaviveka, remarks that the sixteen pretaśrāddhas (to be described later on) are included under naimittika and that such śrāddhas as Gosthi. śrāddha epumerated in other smrtis are included in Pārvana. The Kurmapurana (II. 20. 26) similarly speaks of the five sraddhas as enumerated by Manus57. The Mit. on Yay. I. 217 states that there are five śrāddhas, viz, "ahar-abah-śrāddla, pārvana, yrddhiśrāddha, skoddista and sapipdikarana. Tho daily sraddha is deseribed by Manu III. 82 (= Sankha 13 16 and Matsya 16,4) as one that is performed every day with food (cooked rice, yavas &c.) or with water or with milk, fruits and roots. Two verses of Višvāmitra858 quoted by several works speak of twelve kinds of Sraddhas, viz. nitya, naimittika, kānıya, yrddhi-śrāddha (performed on the birth of a son, marriage or similar incident of good luck ), sapindana (sapiddi karana), pārvana, gosthisraddha, suddhisraddha, karmānga, daivika, yātrāśrāddha, pustišrāddha.

That is called daivika śrāddha which is intended to propitiate gods (it is like nityašrāddha and is performed on the oth or 12th tothor or the like vitu sacrificial food ) When a man going to a distant country on a pilgrimage or the like performs a śraddha in which clarified butter is served (to brāhmadas) in abundance or when he comes back to his house, that is yātra śrāddha, That is called pustišraddha which is performed for the liealth (or fattening) of the body (when taking some medicine for the purpose ) or for the increase of one's wealth. Out of thega 868 telve the principal ones are pārvana, ehoddista, zrdilhe and saprudana. There are works called Şab-Dayatı-sraddha such as those of Sivabhatta, son of Govinda, and of Raghunātha.

the 12 amāvāsyās in the year, the four sraddhas on the Yugādi days (note 841 above), the fourteen śrāddhas on the Manvantarādi days (p. 375 above), the śrāddhas on 12 sankrantis (i. e. the sun's apparent motion from one sign of the Zodiac to another), the 13 śrāddhas on the Yoga called Dhrti (i. e. Vaidhrti) and the 13 śrāddhas on the .Vyatīpāta yoga, the 16 Mahālaya śrāddhas, the four Anvastakā days (according to Ašv. as noted on pp 359-360), the four Astakā days and the four days (i e, 7th of dark half of the months of Hemanta and Sisira) of the day previous ( to the Astaka). These classifications and enumerations of śrāddhas will afford an idea how the doctrine of śrāddhas was carried to an exaggerated extent in the course of centuries. It goes without saying that only a few people could have indulged in the luxury of so many śrāddhas a year and most people were content with the performance of only one Mahālayaśrāddka and one or two more. It may be noted that Manu (II. 122) first prescribed that on the amāvāsyā of each month an elaborate śrāddha should be performed, but knowing that this was almost impossible Manu recommends to all (IIL. 281 ) that an elaborate śrāddha should be performed on three amāvāsyās in one year 862 (viz. in Hemanta, Grisma and Varsa) and one should perform every day the śrāddha which is one of the five daily sacrifices (III. 82-83). Devala went further and recommended that an elaborate śrāddha may be performed only once a year, 

The next important question is about the qualifications of the brāhmanas that were invited to dinner oz & śrāddha day. Only brāhmadas were and are entitled to be invited for śrāddha

who has studied the Veda and is able to teach the whole Veda with its angas, a Srotriya-mthese persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral repast. Gaut. 15. 28, Baud. Dh. S. II. 8.2, Manu II 185–186, Yāj I, 219, Varahapurāna 14,2 contain almost the same words about those who sanctify the company of diners (ie who are panktipõrana). The Anušāsanaparya (90.25-31), Kūrmapurāpa II. 21.1-14, Matsya 16 7-13, Brahmapurāna 220. 101-104, Vāyu 79. 56-59 and 83, 52-55, Skanda VI. 217, 21-25 give long lists of panktipāvana brahmanas. The Hir. Gr. I. 10.2, Baud, Dh. S. II.2.7, Kārma (IT, 21. 14) and others say that & performer of sriddha should invite one who is not a relative connected by marriage (such as & maternal uncle) nor one who is of the same gotra, nor one who is connected with the performer by Veda study (i. e. is his teacher or pupil), nor a friend nor one Tho expects monetary help from the performer. Manu (III. 138-139 ) provides that one should not invite at & śrāddha dinner & personal friend, that one may gain a friend by making Taluable gifts to him (on other occasions), that one should feed at a brāddha & brahmaba whom he does not deem either his friend or foe and that he who performs grāddhas and offer ings to gods chiefly to gain friends reaps no reward after death by those sraddhas or offerings, But Manu IIL 144 (= Kūrma II 21-22) provides that one may invite even a friend but not a foe though the latter may be learned. Manu (II. 135–137 and 145–147 ) lays down that the main or best rule to be followed is to present śrāddha food to those who are devoted to spiritual knowledge, that between a man who has studied one whole recension of the Veda but whose father was not a śrotriya and one who is himself not a śrotriya but whose father had studied a whole recension of the Veda (i.e.whose father was a śrotriya) the latter is the more worthy of the two, that one should strive to feed at a sraddha an adherent of the Rgveds who has studied one entire recension of that Veda or a follower of the Yajurveda who has studied ons Sakha thereof or a singer of samans who has finished one recension of the Samaveda and that if one of these preceding three is honoured and dines at a sraddha, the ancestors of the performer will be gratified up to the seventh generation for a very long time. Harita (q. by Hemādri on śrāddba p. 392 and Kalpataru on śr. pp. 66-67) describes the qualifications of those who are pankteya brāhmanas viz, they must be born in a high family (possessing four characteri stics), must be endowed with learning (of six kinds) and sila

(character of 13 kinds) and good conduct (of 16 kinds). Sabkha Likuita 863 give a long list of pānkteya (fit to be associated with in a parhti i. e. Tow of diners) brāhmaapas, viz he who knows the Voda and the Vedāngas (viz. phonetics, kalpa oi śrauta ritual, grammar, Nirukta, metrics and astronomy); one who keeps the five fires; one who has studied the Veda with its angas; one who koos Sankhya, Yoga, Upanişads and Dharma śāstra; a śrotriya, & trināciketa, trimadhu, trisuparpaka and one that has studied Jyesthasāman; one who has studied Sāókhya, Yoga, Upanisads and Dharmaśāstra; who is devoted to Yeda; who always keeps sacred fires; who is obedient to his parents and devoted to Dharmasastra. Similar rules are laid down by Visnu Dh. S 83, Bțhat-Parašata p. 150, Vļddha-Gau tana p. 581, Prajāpati verses 70-72, Laghu-Satātapa yerses 99 100, Aušanasasmrti (Jiv, vol. I. pp. 523-524). As Medhatithi ! on Manu III, 147 says the gist of all these passages is that a learned brāhmana who has studied the Veda, whose conduct is good, whose family is famous, who is the son of a śrotriya father and who is not related to the performer must be invited and all the rest is mere arthavada (by way of eulogy). Madu (II. 128) laid down two propositions yiz. all food offered as sacrifice to the gods and modes must be given only to a brāh mapa who studies the Veda and that whatever is presented to the most worthy brāhmana (among brāhmanas studying the Veda) brings in the greatest reyards. Then Madu (IL 183) declares that parkirpāvana brahmanas are those that sanctify a row of diners among whom sit some who ars tainted by (latent) blemishes that make them unfit to be among the diners. Then Manu (IIL 184-186) gives examples of panktipāvana brāh manas viz. those who are the foremost among students of all the Vedas or their expository works and who are born in a family of unbroken descent of Vedic students, who are Trina ciketa &o. Hemādri (on śr. pp. 391–395) and Kalpataru (śr. pp. 64-65) quote numerous verses from Yama on panktspāvana. 

Manu III, 147 asserts that the best course is to invita & brāhmana who fulfils the conditions laid down in Madu III.

132-146, but adds that if it is not possible to secure such a brāhmada then the next best course 865 ('anukalpa') may be followed, viz. the performer may invite his own maternal grand father, his maternal uncle, sister's son, father-in-law, bis teacher of the Veda, daughter's son, son-in-law, a bandhu (such as mother's sister's son), wife's brother or a sagotra, or his family priest, or his pupil. Similar provisions oocur in Yāj I. 220, Kūrma (Uttarārdha 21, 20), Varāhapurāna 14, 3, Matsya 16. 10–11, Visnupurāna II, 15. 2-4 (anukalpesyanantarān). But Manu is careful 866 to point out in a later chapter that one who is able to observe the best course, but observes the second best does not reap other-worldly Jewards by his actions. Even Āp. Dh, S. 867 expressly says that if strangers do not possess the requisite qualifications, then even one's full brother possessed of all the qualifications (as to Vedic learning, good conduct &c.) and pupils may be fed at a śrāddha. Baud. Dh. S. also allows even a sapiņda to be fed.s68 Gaut 15. 20 appears to be of the view that even pupils and sagotras may be invited when they are possessed of excellent qualities and strangers with good qualifications are not available. Even in these times yery learned brāhmaṇas are un willing to be fed at a śrāddha, particularly within a few years (three or five) from the death of the person for whose benefit the grāddha is to be performed. Smštis attach a certain stigma to the fact of being the recipient of a śrāddha dinner and prāyasoittas are prescribed. For example, the Mit, on Yāj, IL 289 quotes several verses of Bhāradyāja, one of which says 'If a brāhmana dines at a pārvana śrāddha he has to perform six prādāyāmas (as expiation), if he dines at a śrāddha from the third month after a person's death to one year, he has to undergo a fast; if he dines at & viddhišrāddha, he has to per form three prādāyāmas, and a fast for a day and night if he dines at a sapindana śrāddha,' The Mit, further quotes a

According to Gaut, 15. 10 young persons with the requisite qualifications are to be preferred to older ones, while, according to some, young men were to be invited at a śrāddha for one's deceased father and old men for a śrāddha for one's grand father. On the other hand, Āp. Dh, S. says among brāhmadas possessing the same qualifications, the older ones are to be preferred and among those that are old are to be preferred the poor that are anxious to earn money. 8682 

Some of the works lay special emphasis on inviting ascetics or yogins at a śrāddha dinner. The Visnu Dh. S states that yogins 869 are particularly paiktupāvana and quotes a stanza as recited by the pitrs "May (a, descendant) be born in our family who feeds a brābmana yogin at a śrāddha by which ye are ourselves satisfied,' The Varāhapurāna 14. 50 says that a yogin is superior to 100 brahmanas. The Mārkandeya-purāns provides a wise man should always feed yogins at a śrāddha since the pitrs rely for support on Yoga; if & yogin is fed by being seated as the first among thousands of brāhmanas he saves the performer and the other diners as a boat saves men in water.' Then it quotes stanzas sung by the pitrs (29. 32-34) to king Aila. The Saurapurāna, after mentioning the qualifioa tions (in 19.2-3),870 winds up by stating that even one may suffice provided he be a single-minded devotes of Sivā (verse 6)

The Matsyapurāpa (16. 11-12) recommends 'He who expounds (the meaning of) texts; he who enters upod the discussion of srauta sacrifices and he who knows the rules about the accents of sāmans is a purifier of panktipāvanas; one proficient in the Sāmaveda, a Vedic student, one endowed with knowledge of the Veda or of Brahma 

where these are fed in a frāddha it yields the highest benefit.' 871 Though in the above passages the greatest emphasis was laid on the possession of Vedic learning by the brāhmanas to be fed, one had also to see whether they were men of good character and observers of the rules of proper conduot, as provided by Aśv, Gr. IV. 7, 2 (note 862), Gaut. 15.9 and Manu L. 118 who says 'a brāhmana 872 knowing only the sacred Gayatri but living a well-regulated life is to be preferred and not one who knows the three Vedas but who is not well-regulated in conduct and who eats anything (even forbidden food ) and who is a vendor of everything.' The Skandapurana VI. 217. 27 recommends that one should make every effort to know the family of the brāhmanas, then their character (šila), then their age and then the facts about whom they marry or to whom they give their daughters in marriage. The Brahmānda (Upodghāta, chap 15) says that there should be no scrutiny of a brāhmapa about whom nothing is known because sıddhas (yogins) roam about on the earth in the form of brāhmanas. But if faults in a brāhmana are easily seen or if one knows his disqualifica tions on account of one's dwelling near him, he should not be invited (versos 5-6). The same Purāpa (Upodgbāta 15. 24-26) arranges the orders of preference as follows: first yati (ascetic), then a brāhmana who knows the four Vedas and itibāsa, then one who knows three Vedas, then one who knows two, then one who knows one Veda, then one who is an upadhyāya. Hemādri (on srāddha p. 443) quotes the Agni purāpa 873 as follows: 'what is the use of birth in a) famous

Jatukarnya says 'one should not honour even with a word (much less with food &c.} in rites for gods and Manos bad brābmanas void of good eonduct, even though they be endowed with learning and be born in a good family. This insistence on worth was due to the conception that pitrs assuming an aerial form enter brahmanas at the time of śrāddha. Vide Brahmāndapurane (Upodghatapāda 11. 49). 

These requirements of learning, character and good conduct would naturally make it incumbent on the performer of a grāddha to inquire into the antecedents, qualities and defects of the brāhmanas to be invited, Manu and others lay down Beveral rules about the testing of the brahmapas to be invited. Manu III 149, Visnu Dh.874 S. 82.1-%. provide at an offering to the gods let a man not enquire into (the qualities of a brahmana (when he wants to invite), but at a grāddha offering to the Manes Olose inquiry (into qualities) is declared to bB proper and just.' Madu III, 130 says that even if a brahmana be master of the Veda, one should enquire far (into his ancestry). The Vayupurāna 675 appears to provide that inquiry into ( the qualifications of) brāhmands should not be always undertaken when gifts are to be made, but enquiry is declared (necessary) in the case of rites for gods and Manes. The Anusa sanaparya provides 876 that in rites meant for gods & ksatriya knowing the rules about gifts should not (closely) inquire into the qualifications of brāhmanas, but in rites for the gods and Manes such inquiry is quite proper. Vrddha-Madu and the Matsya-purāna877 lay down that a brāhmana's character is to be inquired into at the place where he resides for a long time, his purity by his acts and transactions with other people, his iptelli gonce by discussion with him; with these three one should inquire whether the brābmapa (to be invited) is a worthy person,

Inquiring into qualifications 

391 

IV 

The Nrsimhapurāna. 878 forbids close inquiry into the character and learning of one who comes by chance as a guest at the time of grāddba. That inquiry was allowed as to brāhmadas who were invited and not as to those who came by chance uninvited as anthis. There are no doubt certain passages particularly in the Puranas where scrutiny into & brāhmana's qualifications is condemned. For example, the Skandapurāna quoted by Apa rārka (p. 455) and Kalpataru ( on śr. p. 102) states The Vedic revelation is that śrāddha is to be offered (to & brāhman&) after inquiry (into his learning and character), but straightforward action is better than scrutiny. When one offers srāddha straightforwardly without inquiry his pitrs are gratified and also gods'. The Bhavisyapurāpa (q.. by Balanbbatti) states 'it is my view also that one should not test (the qualifications of) brāhmanas; one should only consider their caste and not their virtues'. Such passages are explained away as referring to a śrāddha at sacred places or as applicable to gifts or to atthis (vide Hemadri op sraddha p. 513, and Balambhatti on ācāra p. 494) 8784, 

Brahmanas vere declared to be apankteya 879 (not fit to sit in the row of brahmana diners or as defiling & row of diners at śrāddha) on various grounds, such as bodily and mental defects and diseases, purauit of certain avocations, moral lapseg, being guilty of crimas, being followers of unorthodox systems, being inhabitants of certain countries. A distinction has to be made batween brāhmanas who should not be invited and brahmapas that are apānkteya or panktidūsaka. For example, one should not ordinarily javite a friend or a sagotra brāhmana even

mapas at a śrāddha repast, Manu III. 170-182 indulge in pointing out how feeding such unworthy brāhmanas results in the logs of the gratification of pitrs and state that the food eaten by such unworthy persons becomes or is to be deemed as equal to foul things. The Kûrmapurāna 882 forbids inviting at śrāddhas Bauddha ascetics, Nirgranthas (devotees who have withdrawn from the world and wander about naked or as beggars), those that follow the Pancarātra and Pāśupata doctrines, those that are kāpālikas (devotees of Siya of the left hand order) and other similar heretical people. The Visnupurana (III. 18, 70 ff) narrates how a king after a bath in a holy place talked with a heretic and had to pass in consequence through the bodies of a dog, a jackal, wolf, vulture, a crow, a crane and peacock and ultimately became freed from the taint by a bath at the ava bhṛtha in an Aśvamedha sacrifice. The same Purana provides (ILL. 18 97 ) that one should avoid talking with or touching heretics, particularly at the time of a religious rite or when one has consecrated for a solemn sacrifice. The Vayupurāna 883 provides that people who are 'nagna' should not be allowed to see a śrāddha and then defines "nagna' people as follows: 'the three Vedas are declared to be a protective covering for all beings and therefore those who foolishly abandon the Vedas are called 'nagoa'; those who yainly keep matted hair, those who share their heads for no purpose, those who are nagna (naked) without any cause, those who engage in certain obser yances and mutter certain words aimlessly are called nag nādi'. Just as certain countries were declared unfit for the performance of śrāddhas (vide pote 853 above), so certain brāhmaṇas hailing from certain countries were declared in some

Hemādri(on érāāābs p. 505) quotes from the Saurapurāna the following: 'Brāhmanss hailing from the countries of Inga, Tanga, Kaliiga, Saurispring (Fathiapar), Gurjara, Abhira, Konkana, Dravida, Dašşidāpatia, Aranti and Magadha should be groided at śrāddhas. It will be noticed that putting the above to passages together, brāhmapas from half of modern India mondd hare been ideligi ble for being invited at śrāddhas if these passages rare literalls followed. This pas probably a counsel of perfection prompted by the false pride and prejudices of the authors of those Torks. The Sraddharireka of Rudradhara (pp. 391) contains one of the longest lists of persons unfit to be joribed at a šrāddha 

The following reason is advanced by the Tarākapuring ** and others for honouring a guest Tho comes by chance at the time when a stāddha rite is in progress: "Iogins ander Ora the earth assuming different forms that present recognition, bat doing good to people; therefore a rise man should honour S guest who artires at the time of the performance of a šāddha". The Bharissa-pwāp3 similarly says that an asti (guest) at a šrāddha is one tho comes when least thought of and got one who had arrired before the śrādõha rife started. The Mārkanders ( 26, 30) provides that one should not ask such an alkthi about his gatra or carana or his Vedic stuar por should one consider whether he has a fine appearance.

Hemādri (Srāddhakānda, pp, 380-385 ) holds an intereste ing disoussion as to whether a performer of śrāddha belonging to one recension of a Veda must restrict himself to inviting brāhmanas that are students of the same recension of the Veda or whether he can invite any brāhmana that may bave studied any of the three Vedas. Some people relying on a maxim ('as in the case of a bride so in the case of an offering') invite only brahmanas of their own sākhā possessed of the qualifications above set forth. Hemādri replies tbat this is a wrong notion, relies on Ap. Dh, S. II. 6. 15. 9 'one should feed 887 in all (religious) acts brāhmapas that are pure (in their conduct) and that have studied the Veda' and asserts that no smrti, Itihasa, Purāda, Grhyasūtra nor Kalpasūtra contains the restriction of inviting only brāhmadas of the performer's own sākhā, He further says that in such texts as 'tripāciketas trimadhuh' (quoted in note 862a above) the rule laid down is to inpite brāhmavas that have studied different sakhās and Vedas. He rejects the idea about any restriction as to selecting a bridegroom of the same sākhā as the bride's father and remarks that if some people are not prepared to give their daughters in marriage to young men belonging to other sākhās, that is due to ignorance about the families and is also due to pride 'and vanity. He winds up by saying that in Aryāyarta countries it is found on all sides that marriage connections are entered into with persons studying different sākhās but living in the same district, (such connections) not being con demned, while persons who study the same sākhā of the Veda but do not know each other do not enter into marital connec tions.888 As a contrast to this commonsepse view it should be

ing (of food) is eaten by a zati that knows the truth about - pralcrti (primordial matter) and the gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) reaps the reward (merit) of feeding a thousand (other brābmapas), Therefore one should feed in offerings to gods and manes an excellent yogin who is intent on true knowledge of God and others only if such a one is not available. Similar Verses about ascetics and yogins occur in Varāhapurāna 14, 50, Skanda (VI.217.7ff) and Vayupuranasi chap. 71.65-13, chap. 76.28 &c. Brhaspati provides 892 a special rule that, if a person cannot afford to feed at a śrāddba more than one brahmana, then he should feed one who has studied the Sāmaveda, since in him all the three viz. Rks, the Yajus and Samans co-exist, that the father is pljased by Rks (i. e, by the feeding of a brahmana who has studied the Rgveda), the grand-father by Yajus, the great-grand-father by a Sāman and a chandoga (a chanter of the whole of Samaveda) is superior. A Verse of Satatapa is 893 quoted to the effeot that if a student of the Atharyayeda is fed in a rite for the gods or manes, that yields endless and inex haustible rewards, 

Some of the smrtis were very strict in laying down the qualifications of brābmanas to be invited at a śrāddha, Ausa nasa (chap.4) asserts: 'that brahmana 894 is called durbrali mana and should never be invited at a śrāddha in whose family Veda study and Vedi (i. e. the performance of Srauta sacri fices) have been stopped for three generations'.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. author 895 further says that six persons are merely brahma bandhus (i, e. brāhmanas by birth or caste alone) viz, one who is hired by a šūdra or a king as a servant, who has a šūdra woman as his wife, who is a village priest and he who subsists by killing (animals) or by oatching them. So early as the Mahābhāsya 89 it was stated that austerities (leading a life of restraint and strict observances), Vedic learning and birth (from brābmapa parents) are the causes of (a man being called) a brāhmada and that he who is devoid of the first two is a mere brahmana by caste (but not a real brāhmapa). It is curious to note that Yama stated that, if brahmanas that do not declare (or point out) the auspicious naksatra or tathi or day or mu. harta and other auspicious matters, eat (sraddha) food it be comes inexhaustible. 

But the requisite qualifications were so exacting that it must have been found almost impossible to secure for a śrāddha brāhmabas altogether free from any of the blemishes set out above from Manu. Gautama (15 15-18) contains long lists 897 of over 50 kinds of brāhmadas that were not to be invited at a śrāddha dinner or at a sacrifice for gods, but Gaut, adds that according to some only those beginning with "durvāla' (Gaut, in 15.18) were to be shunned at a śrāddha (but could be invited at a sacrifioe for the gods). The persons so to be shunned, according to some who flourished before Gautama (i. e at least before 600 B O) are. a bald man, a man who has deformed nails or has black teeth (naturally), one suffering from white

Vas. quotes a verse 998 as follows: If a brāhmana knowing the Vedas is afflicted with physical defects which (ordinarily) exclude a person from a row of diners, Yama declares that he is irrepro achable and that he does sanctify the row of diners. But it must be said that even in modern times emphasis is laid on 

inviting learned and well-conducted brahmanas for śrāddha, The idea (expressed by Manu I, 189 and the Padmapurana) parsists that the prits enter into and hover round the invited brahmanas and that the latter are to be looked upon as represen ting the pitīs.899 The Garudapurāna states that Yama allows the departed souls and the pitrs to visit the world of men at the time of śrāddha from the nether regions. 

The Visnu Dh, S. (79. 19-21) prescribes that the perforiner should avoid wrath, should not shed tears and should not do things in a hurry.

Kūrma (uttarārdha 22. 8) states that if a person first invites a brahmana and then foolishly invites another (passing over the first) then he becomes a greater sinner (than the brāhmana who after accepting one invitation promises to dino at another śrāddha) and is born as a worm in human faeces. The Bhavisyapurāņa 902 provides that honouring gods, pitrs and men and feeding (brāhmanas) should not be done without wearing an upper garment; otherwise the rite will bear no fruit. 

About the number of brāhmadas to bo invited at a śrāddha there were several options and several views. The Asy.Gr. S. states 903 that at the Pārvana--śrāddha (performed on a par van day i. e. on Amavasya), the Abhyudayika sraddha, the Ekod dista or Kümya, the larger the number of brābmanas the greater is the reward, that in no case should & person invite only one brahmana at a śrāddha meant for all pitts or he may optionally invite only one brāhmana except at the first śrāddha, that he may invite one, two or three brāhmanas for each of the turee paternal ancestors, The San, Gr. (IV. 1,2)and Kausitaki Gr II, 14.1-% prescribe that one should 904 invite an uneven number of brālmapas, at least three, to sit down as (representing the) fathers. Gaut, requires 905 'He shall feed an uneven number

of brāhmanas, at least nine or as many as ho is able (to feed) and that they should be learned in the Veda and endowed with polished speech, good appearance, mature age and good character', If five were invited two would b3 for gods and three for pitrs; if seven, then four for gods and three for pitra and so on. Vas. XI, 27(= Manu II, 125 = Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 29), Yāj. 1. 228, Matsya 17. 13-14, Vispupurāda II 15.14 provide that one must feed two brahmanas at the rite for the gods and three for the manes or one only for each of the two purposes and even a rich man should not go in for a large company. The Padma purana (Srsti 9.98 and 141 ) says the same thing. So the number of brālımanas to be invited did not depand so much upon the means of the inviter, but upon the point whether the iugiter would be able to honour them all properly and with ease. The idea was that at the same time when śrāddha was to be performed two brābmanas should be fed for gods and three for the pitrs. When only one brāhmana could be invited or was available, Vas. (XI. 30-31) provides that portions of the several foods cooked should be put in a vessel and should ba placed at the place where Vaišvadevika brāhmana would have been seated, then served in a plate and the viste devāh be invoked and should be contemplated as present and then the food should be thrown into the fire or offered to a Vedic student (as almas) and then šraddha rite should be continued, Sankha 906 14.10 provides a similar rule. The result is that if a man can afford to invite only one brāhmapa Or can secure one only, then that brāhmapa is meant for the rite in honour of pitrs and the offering for the gods is to be cast into fire. Baud. DI, S. II, 8.30, Manu III, 126, Vas. XI. 28, Kurma (uttarārdha 22 28) contain the same verse which emphatically states 'A. large company destroys these five desiderata, viz the respectful treatment (of those invited), the securing of a proper place (such as ona sloping to the south) and time, purity and (the

[Vol. choice of) ineritorioua brālmanas; thereforo one should not desire a large company 907 The Kūrorapurāpa (uttarardha 22.32 ) insists that an atithe must be fed at a śrāddha or other, wise the śrāddha is not praiseworthy. Though these ancient works insisted upon the avoidance of large preparations and expenses for śrāddhas in honour of a deceased person, there were other smrtis that favoured lavish distribution of wealth in śrāddhas. For exanıple, Brhaspati lays down: '( An heir ) should lay aside half of the wealth that comes to him (by inheritance ) for the benefit of the deceased owner and should expend it in the monthly, six-monthly and yearly śrāddhas'. The Dāyabhāga XI. 12 approves 908 of this and also quotes Ap, Dh. S. II. G. 13.3 'On the failure of a sapinda the teacher of the Veda takes the wealth of the deceased, on failure of the teacher, the pupil takes it and having inheri ted it he should employ it in the performance of works of charity for the benefit of the deceased' (or he himself may enjoy it). These passages show to what lengths the cult of benefit to the soul of the deceased was carried in India by certain writers. More practical authors such as Haradatts did not relish these extreme views. In severa) purādas such as the Vayu 9084 and Visou there are express directions that when a śrāddba is performed at Gayā, it should be on a profuse scale and no stinginess 909 (lit. cheating in money matters ) in spending wealth should be shown there; otherwise the performer would not reap the benefit of the performance of śrāddha at that holy place. The Padmapurāna appears to inculcate profuse

expenditure of wealth in all śrāddhas, The Vāyupurāna 910 (82, 26-28 ) further says that the brāhmapas of Gayā are super men, that when they are gratified (at a śrāddha) the gods together with pitrs become gratified, that no question should be raised about the family, the character, the learning and the austerities (of the Gayā brāhmadas), that by honouring them a man attains liberation, that a man after honouring the brābmanas should proceed according to his resources and strength to the performance of śrāddha, thereby he secures all heavenly desires and obtains the means of Moksa. The Skanda purāpa goes so far as to say that Gayā brābmanas even if they are depraved in their conduct and are backward deserve to be invited at sraddha and are superior to brāhmadas who have mastered the Veda and Vedāngas. The Nirnayasindhu (IIT. P. 401 ) notes that, according to the Tristhalisetu of his grandfather, this provision holds good only in the case of the śrāddha at the Aksayya Vata in Gayā and nowhere else. In modern times the brāhmanas at Gayā. used to require the performer of śrāddha while he was in the sacred Phalgu river to make a declaration about his wealth and demanded fees accordingly, thereby carrying to the letter the words of the Vāyupurāna, Many people returned from Gaya thoroughly dis illusioned and disgusted with the conduct of the brāhmanas at Gayā. In the Varāhapurāna 911 it is said that two yerses were sung by the pitrs viz Would such a blessed and intelli gant man be born in our family who will offer piodas (i. e. srāddha) to us without being stingy about wealth and who would bestow on brāhmanas with reference to us (i. e. for our benefit) jewels, clothes, land, costly vehicles and all other kinds of wealth including water, when he has riches enough? Here lavish expenditure on all śrāddhas (not only at Gayā. śrāddha) appears to be strongly recommended. Davala prc

itself. The Matsyapurāna 913 and Padma (Srsti-khanda 9.85-88) provide that the person intending to perform a śrāddha should in an humble manner invite the brābmanas on the previous day or (in the morning of) the day of śrāddha, that he should touch the right knee (of the brālmana to be invited) with the words 'you are given this invitation by me' and repeat in their hearing the following observance' you should be free from anger, should be intent on purity (of body and mind) and should abstain froni sexual intercourse and I, the performer of śrāddha, shall also act in the same way and that the pitrs in an aerial form wait upon the invited brāhmanas.' The Brhan-nāradiya-purapa states that the invitation should be in the words 'O best men You should do me a favour and accept the invitation for śrāddha. It is noteworthy that the Prajāpati-smrti (63) prescribes that one sliould invite brāhmanas for a śrāddha or sacrifice for gods in the evening of the previous day after uttering the verse 'akrodhanaiḥ &c.'914 The Skandapurāda VI. 217. 37 says that the performer should address the brāhmana as follows: 'my father (is or will enter) into this your body and so will my grand-father; let him (the grand-father) come with his father and you should strictly observe the vrata' (the rules ). The invitation to the brābmapas representing pitrs is to be given with the sacred thread in the prācīnāvīta form and to those for Vaišvadevika in the yajiopavīta form, On the question whether the Vaišvadeyika brāhmanas were to be invited first or the brāhmanas for pitig were to be invited first

there is a conflict among smrtis and the medieval digests propose an option (vide Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1154-1157). Manu III. 205 appears to lay down that the daiva brāhmana should te invited first (daivādyantam tad-ıheta). Yama quoted by several digests 915 says that the performer should request in the evening of the previous day brāhmanas with the words 'You should all be free from exertions and should avoid passion and anger for the srāddha in my house which is to be performed tomorrow,' that the brābmadas should reply 'let it be so if the night passes happily and without any mishap to us.' The digests (e. g. Sraddhakriyakaumudi p. 81, Srāddhatattva p 194 and Nirdayasindhu III, p. 804) say that the verse 'saryāyāsa &c'may be repeated when the invitation is given on the day previous to the day of sraddha and the verse 'akrodhanaih' when the invitation is given on the morning of the grāddha day. The words of invitation differ according to different authorities, For example, according to the Mit. on Yāj I. 225 the words are "śrāddhe ksanah kriyatām.' Vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 algo. Manu TIT, 187 and 191 show that the words 'nimantrana' and 'amantrana' are used as synonyms. In the Sraddhasūtra 916 of Kātyāyana the word 'āmantrada'is used. But Pāpini 917 (NI, 3 161) apparently makes a difference between the meanings of the two words and the Mahābhāsya explains that invitation is called 'nimantrada' which if rejected (without proper cause) involves a fault or sin, while that invitation which one is free to reject (without incurring blame) is called 'āmantrana.' There fore, it must be held that the few writers such as Kātyāyana 

The who employ amantrana use it in a secondary sense. invitation should be given by a performer himself or by his son,

brother or a pupil or a brāhmaṇa, but it should not be given through a person of another varna 916 or a woman or a child or person belonging to another gotra por from a distance (Prajapati 64). Pracetas provides that a brāhmaṇa performer of śrāddha when giving an invitation should touch the right knee, a ksatriya inviter the left knee of the invitee, a Vaiśya inviter should hold both feet of the invitee and a sādra should prostrate himself at the feet of the invitee (vide Sx. Pr. p. 106 and S. K. L. p. 47). The Markandeya (28. 35) states an exception that if, when a sraddha rite is going on, brāhmagas or Vedic students or ascetics come by chance begging for food, the performer should make them pleased by falling at their feet and feed them (i, e, no formal invitation is necessary in these cases). Vide Visnupurana III. 15, 12 for feeding uninvited ascetics. It is provided by Bhrgu quoted by Henādri that the brāhmanas on accepting the invitation should pronounce the finely-worded and comprehensive Vedic benediction quoted below.19 

Ušanas 919a provides that the performer should wash the floor of his house with water, covdung it and cleange the vessels on the day previous to the sraddha and then give an invitation to the brāhmaṇas with the words 'tomorrow I am going to perform srāddha'. The Varahapurana and the Karma algo provide for this and for the washing of the clothes, Manu II. 206 also requires that the spot where śrāddha is to be performed should be clean, secluded, cowdunged and should clope to the south.

mana who bas been invited (to a śrāddha dinner) by a faultless performer should not refuse the invitation nor should lie, aftor being invited (and having acoepted the invitation), accept a gift of even (uncooked) food from another person. Manu III 190 and Kūrmapurāna provide that if a brahmada after recairing on invitation for a sacrifice to gods or manes according to sāgtra directions and after having accepted at violates the appoint ment, he incurs sin and becomes a hog 921 (in his next birth). This does not apply where he is unable to go on account of illness or other valid reason. 

The smrtis laid down some strict and elaborate rules which were to be observed by the brābmapas invited for śrāddha and by the performer himself. Many of the rules are applicable to both, Gaut prescribes 922 that the brahmana who has partaken of śrāddha dinner should remain chaste (1, e. shun sexual inter course) that whole day, and if he was intercourso with a wifo of the gūdra caste be thereby makes his own pilrs stay in tho ordure of that wife. Vas XI, 37 makes this rule applicablo both to the performer and the invited brāhmada and as regards wives of all varnas. Manu III. 188 prorides that the brālimana invited to dine at a sacrifice in honour of patrs and tho por former of the sraddha should remain controlled (1 o. chasto and free from anger and passion) and should not study the Veda (except jana). Yāj. I. 225 (latter lialt) briefly puts the matter by saying 'they should be controlled as to their bodios, speech and thoughts'. The Matssapurina prescribes thint both the performer of sriddha and the brahmana invited to dino at it should avoid dining again (after the śrūddha dinner), journey, going in a conveyanco, ovortions, scrual întorcourse, study of the Voda, quarrch and sleoping by day.

śrāddha and also on the provious day if invitation be given on the day previous to the śrāddha day. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 69, 2-4, The Mit, on Yāj. I79 appears to strike a dissenting note about sexual intercourse with one's wife during the days from the 5th to the 16th; while most other medieval writers such as Hemadri (śr. pp. 1036-7) and Sr. P. p. 111 are opposed to this view, The Sraddhasūtra 924 of Kātyāyana provides that the performer should, from the time of giving invitation to the time when the brālmapas sip water (i. e, perform acamana after srāddba dinner), remain pure, free from anger, hurry, negligence, should speak the truth and should shun a journey, sexual intercourse, hard work and study of the Veda and control speech (should remain mostly silent) and the brābmapas invited should observe the same rules Aušanasa (Jiv, vol I pp. 526-527) contains verses very similar in import to Kātyāyana. The Brahmapurāpa (220. 106-108), Mārkandeya (28. 31-33) and Anušāsana 125.24 have identical verses 925 and Vāyu 79. 60-61 are very similar in import, Laghu-Sankha 29, Laghu-Hārīta 75 and Likhita 60 have the same verse requiring the invited brāhmanas to avoid eight matters, viz. dining'again, journey, carrying loads, Vedic study, sexual intercourse, making gifts, accepting gifts, performing homa, while Prajāpati 92 substi tutes the brushing of the teeth (with a twig), tāmbüla, bath after applying oil to the body, and fast for the first four of the above eight The Anušāsanaparva (90. 12-13) and Padma (Pātālakhanda 101, 94-95) also contain a list of actions that should be avoided Briefly put, the following were the obser vances for both inviter and invitee, vix avoidance of sexual intercourse, dining again, falsehood, hurry, vedic study, heavy work, gambling, carrying burdens, giving gifts and acceptance of gifts, theft, journey, sleep by day, quarrels; the performer alone was to abstain from eating tāmbūla, shaving, applying oil to the body, brushing the teeth with a twig; while the brāh

Elaborato provisions nro made from anoient times about the substances and utonsila propor for boing usod at śrāddha and about tlioso that should not bo usod therein. Ap.

Manu III. 267 ( = Vāyu 83.3) is to the same effect as An. Dh, S. Yaj. 1. 258 is content to say that food which is fit to bo offorod in sacrifices (havidya) should be served, Manu III. 257 oxplains that food eaten by lormits in the forost, ( cow's ) Inills, soma juico, moat that is not prepared with spicos (or that is froo from a bad smell), rock salt aro by thoir vory naturo lavis (sacrificial food). According to Gaut. 27. 11 the sacrificial food (havis) comprises boiled rico, food obtainod by bogging, ground barley (after being bakod or fried), grain separated from husk, barley gruel, vege tablos, milk, curds, clarifiod butter, roots, fruits and water. 928 Other smrtis and digasts very much elaborated these brief indications in the early works. The three kinds of wealth (viz, suhla, tavala and krona ) and the several lawful or uncondemned moane of acquiring wealth have been described already in H, of Dhi. volIL PP 130 ff. The Mārkandeya (29. 14-15) copdemns the use in śrāddhas of wealth that is obtained by taking bribes or from a patita (one guilty of & grave sin), that springs from bride-price or that is declared to be unlawful or is obtained by saying to another 'give me for the sake of a sraddha to be offered to my father' (q. by Sin, O. on

sraddha p. 412). The Skandapurāpa emphasizes that at a Sraddha purity (suddhi) must be specially secured in seven matters viz. the body (of the performer), the materials, the wife, the place (where śrāddha is to be performed), the mind, the mantras and brāhnanas, 929 Manu IL 235 (Vas. 11,35) states: three are the sanctifying things in a $rāddha, viz, a daughter's son, a Nepal blanket and gesamum greins and three are commended in šrāddha viz, cleanliness, freedom from anger and absence of burry.929 Pracetas mentions several kinds of porn that are commended as food in srāddha. Manu III, 255 summarises that in šrāddha the riches (i. e. the most im portant matters) are afternoon, darbhas, proper cleansing of the place (or house) for grāddha, sesame, generous expense (on food &c.), solsoning food, eminent brāhmanas. 

The Mārkandeya-purāda says that several kinds of corn yielding plants (some due to tillage in villages and some growing wild) wore produced by Brahmā when he milked the earth for famished people, while Brahmavaivarta (q. by Hemādri on grāddha p. 537 ) affirms that when a few particles fell down on the earth while Indra drank Soma, from them aroge such corn as śyāmāka, wheat, yava, mudga and red paddy and as they were produced from soma they were like nectar to the pitrs and food prepared from these should be offered to pitrs. The Mārkandeya speaks of seven kinds of grāmya corn and seven kinds of wild (aranya) corn. Prajāpati 119 recommends the use of eight kinds of corn, viz. nīvāra, māsa, mudga, wheat, paddy, yava, grain and sesamum. The Matsya (g by Hemādri op śrāddha p. 538) narrates that when the Sun drank nectar some drops fell down from which arose the several kinds of

paddy, mudga, sugarcane and that therefore sugar is sacred and may be omployed in sacrificos to gods and manes, The Mārkandoya 930 montions soveral kinds of corn that may be omployod for śrāddha food. The Brabnia-purāna 220, 154– 155, Vayı 82, 3, Visnupurāna III. 16. 5-6, Visnu, Dh.

The Vayupurana (80.42-18) mentions various desirable eatables proparod from corn of various kinds, sugar and clarified buttor and millr.32 

Certain kinds of corn and cereals woro forbidden. Tor example, the Matsya-purana and Padma (Srstikhanda, chap. 962-66)933 declare that masira, linseed, nispava, rājamasa, kusumbhilka, kodrava, udara, gram, kapittha, madhaka and linseed are forbidden Visnu Dh S. 79. 18 provides that the performer should avoid tho bean called rājamāsa, masūra, stalo food and salt manufactured from seawater. The Sat-tramsa mnata 931 forbids the use in šrāddha of all kinds of cereals covered with dark busk except sesamum, mudga and māsa.

What milk and water to be used 

415 

From considerations of space this matter cannot be pursued further. The Mit, on Yaj. I 240 puts together a long list of allowed and of condemned kinds of grains and other articles, 

What milk should be ordinarily partaken of and what sliould be avoided has been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II pp. 782-783. A few words are added here. Manu III, 271 and Yāj.I. 258 provide that if cow's milk or rice cooked therein (called payasa) is offered in śrāddha the pitrs are satisfied for one year. Vāyu 78.17, Brahma 935 220 169, Mārkandeya 32 17-19, Vispupurāna III.16.11 forbid the use in a śrāddha of the milk of a she-buffalo, of a camari or female deer, of sheep or eves, of she camels, of human females and of all animals with one hoof and the use of the curds and clarified butter prepared from such milk. But ghee prepared from buffalo milk was allowed by Subantu and Devala (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 572 ). 

The Mārkandeyapurana 936 (29.15-17), Vayu (78.16) and Visoupurana (I 16 10) lay down that the water to be employed in sraddha must not have a bad smell, must not be foamy, or taken from a puddle or a small reservoir which cannot slake the thirst of a cow, must not have been brought oveinight, must not be taken from a reservoir not dedicated to all or from a trough or the like meant for beasts. 

Several rules are laid down about the fruits, roots and vegetables recommended or condemned for use in sraddha, For example, the Brahma-purāpa (220.156-158 ) enumerates several kinds of fruits such as mangoes, bilza, pomegranate, cocoanut, dates, grapes, as fit to be given in śrāddba. Vide Sankha 14 22-23 also. Tayu (78 11-15 ) states 936r that garlic, leeks and onions, other things that are of bad odour or taste

and all erudation from trees not permitted by the Veda and sa gathered from saltish earth, should be avoided jo śrāddha. Th Vispudharmasūtra 93 (79.17) contains a long list of fruits bulbs and vegetables that were not to be employed in šrāddha. The Rāmāyāda states 938 that Rāma when an exile in the Dandake forest gratified his pitrs by offering the fruits of inguda, badara, and bilva trees and generalises that deities are offered that food which is partaken of by a person (who is a devotes of That deity). From considerations of space detailed references to the smrtis and purānas are passed over. The Smrtyarthasara pp. 52-53, Srāddhavireka (pp. 43–47) of Rudradhara and other digests collect in one place the foods, vegetables, fruits and roots that are allowed to be offered in śrāddha and that are condemned in graddba. Manufactured salt was forbidden, but natural salt from a lake (called saindhava) was allowed, Salt was not to be served directly (as Visnudharmasūtra 79. 12 says) but when put in while cooking Fegetables it was not prohibited. There was a difference of opinion about the employment of asafoetida (vide Hemādri on Srāddha p. 565). The Vişpadharmasātra (79.5-6) provides that flowera baving a strong (or nasty) odour or no odour at all, the blossoms of thordy plants and red flowers should not be given, but one may give white and sweet-smell ing flowers even though they are taken from thorny plants and flowers though red in colour may be taken from aquatic plants, Sankha (14, 15-16) is to the same effect (q. by Hem dri p 684). Vāyu (75. 33-35) is to the same effect and adds that the flowers called Japā, Bhandi, Rūpikā (of arka plant), Kurantaka should be avoided in śrāddha. The Brahmapurāda (220, 162 165 ) specifies the several kinds of flowers that may be offered in śrāddha such as jāti, campaka, mallika, mango blossom, tulasi, tagara, ketaki and various kinds of lotuses (white, blue and red &c.). The Smrtyarthasāra includes tulasī among things to be avoided in śrāddha. The Sm. C. notes this and remarks

Kušas are required in srāddha, Vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 657 for general remarks on kušas. A few words may be added here. The Sat. Br. VII. 2. 3.

III. 2.2 Bummarizes a Brah mapa text stating that darbhas are the essence of waters and herbs (apām pā ega ogadhinim raso yad-darbhāh), Prajapati (verse 98) 939m provides that darbhas should be gathered iron a pura spot in the morning by a brahmana, should have mantrag rapeated over them, should be greenish in colour, should be as long as a coy's ear and then they are loly. The Gobhila gr. (1.5.16-17) states 'the barhis consists of kusa grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main strik and that the blades should be cut off near the roots at the ritos meant for the Fathers'. Daksa (IL. 33 and 35) provides that the second part of the day (divided into eight parts) is the proper time for collecting fuelsticks, flowers and kušas. The Gobhilasınrti 1120-21) says that the darbhas used in sacrifices are green nish, those to be used in Pakayajñas should be yellowish, thoso jo rites for the pitis must be taken out from the roots and thoso that are to be used in Vaišvadeva should be dark-pale, and that

greenish darbhas together with ends uncut, that are smooth and well nourished, one aratni in length and touched with that part of the hand called pitrtirtha are pure. The Padmapurana (Srstikhanda 11.92 ) and Skanda VII.1. 205.16 state that kušas and black sesamum spring from the body of Visnu and the Vispudharmottara I, 139.12 says that tılas and darbhas sprang from the perspiration and hair of Visou in the Boar incarna tion, The Matsya (22.89 ) says the same. 

The Garuda 941 (Pretakhanda 2,21-22) states that all the three gods dwell in kuša grags viz, Brahmā at its root, Visnu in the middle and Sankara at the end and that brāhmadas, mantras, kušas, fire, tnlasf leaf--these do not become nirmālya (stale and so unfit to be used again ) even when the same are employed again and again. But an exception is made by Gobhila 912 that those darbhaš which are spread on the ground for placing pindas on them or that are used in tarpana and those that are held in the hand while a man is answering the calls of nature should be given up (and not used again). The Visnu Dh. S. 79.2 and Vāyu 75,41 provide that if kuģas are not avail able, kāśa grass or Dryā may be substituted. The Skanda: purāpa VII (Prabhasakhanda ) part 1.206.17 says that straight darbhas are used in giving gifts, at baths, in japa, homa, dinner and worship of gods, but they are double-folded when used in rites for pitṛs. The Skanda VIT, 1 205.16 provides that the top of darbhas is for divine rites, while darbha with the root and tip 13 meant for partrla rites. This is based on the Sat. Br II 4. 2.17 which states that the top of the darbha belongs to gods, the middle to men and the root part to the fathers, 

Great importance was attached to the use of trla (sesamum) in śrāddha. The Jaiminigrhya II,1 states that the whole house should have sesamum grains scattered about in it. Baud Dk. S II. 88 provides that when the invited brāhmadas come they should be given water mixed with sesame, The Baud, gr. I. 11.64 provides that sesamum grains are holy in šrāddha for making gifts of them or as part of food or for being mixed in

water. The Prajapatismrti speaks 943 of four kinds of tilas viz. white, black, very black and jartilas and states that each succeeding one gives greater gratification to the pitrs than each preceding one. The Tai, S. V. 4.3.2 refers to jartilas and Jai. X. 8.7 holds a discussion thereon. The Nāradapurāna (pārvārdha 28 36) 944 provides that the performer of śrāddha should scatter tılas in the midst of the brāhmanas invited and at the doors with the mantra 'apahatā' (may tho asuras and evil spirits that sit on the altar be struok and run away). Yaj. I. 234 also recommends this mantra (which is Vāj. S. II. 29). The Kūrma purāna (II. 22. 18 ) states that sesame should be scattered all round and a goat should be tied near the spot, since śrāddha polluted by asuras becomes purified by sesame and a goat. The Vispupurāpa (III. 16.14 ) prescribes that by tilas scattered on the ground one should ward off evil spirits (Yātudhāna ). The Garudapurāna 945 (Pretakbapda 2. 16 ) makes Srikrsna say 'tilas have sprung from the 'perspiration on my body and are holy; asuras, dūnavas and daityas run away on account of tilas.' The Anušāsana-parva (90.22 ) says that yātudhānas and goblins snatch away the laurs when the śrāddha is offered without tilas. The Krtyaratnākara (p. 540 ) quotes a verse as follows: 'he who applies as unguent tilas, who bathes with water in which tilas are mixed, offers trlas into fire, makes gifts of trlas, oats tilas and who grows tilas-these six never sink (i, e, are not unlucky nor in trouble ). 

A great deal is said about the vessels to be used in offering aighya (water for honouring the invited brāhmanas and pipdas), for cooking śrāddha food, for dining and for serving. The Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana 946 provides that the arghya water

(79. 14-15) provides that the performer should employ metallic vessels, particulariy vessels made of silver, The Mārkandeya (31.65) and Vāyu (74.3) state that in & vessel of silver the (ancient) pitrs milked sudha and hence & silver vessel is highly desired by pitrs and brings de light to them. Yaj. I 237 also specially recommends silver Vessels. The Vayu (74. 1-2), Matsya (17. 19-22), Brahmanda (Upodghāta 11. 1-2) and Padma (Srstikhanda 9. 147-150) state that vessels of gold, silver or copper are the (propor) 0293 for pitrs; that even the talk about silver or the sight or gift of silver gives inexhaustible results to pitrs in heaven, that vessels to be used for arghya, for pioda and for the food to be offered should be preferably of silver and that in rites for gods a silver Vesso) is not auspicious. Atri (g by Sm. C. II, p. 464) says that in rites for the gods and pitrs, vessels of gold and silver should be respectively employed and in default of those vessels of other metals (such as copper, bell-metal) should be used (as stated by Visou Dh, S. 79,22 and 24). The Padma provides 957 that the vessels may be of sacrificial wood or of palasa or of silver or made from a sea product (such as conch shell) and that since silver was produced from the eye of Siva, it is a great favourite with pitrs. Prajāpati (111) provides that the three pindas should be cast in a vessel of gold or silver or copper or bell matal or of rhinoceros horn but not in earthenware or a wooden Vessel, that (verse 112) the cooking vessels should be of copper or of any metal, but an earthen vessel baked in fire and immersed in water is the best (for cooking), that food cooked in an iron vessel is like crow's flesh, that (115) the vessels to be used for taking food by the brāhmanas should be made of gold, silver or of an alloy of five metale or they may take their food in patrāvalı (i. e, leaves stitched together); vide also Matsya

Vessels to be used at śrāddha

17. 19-20. The use of plantain leaves for bhojana is forbidden9470 by some. Brāhmanas should not take acamana from a vessel made of bell-metal, kharpara, śukra, stone, clay, wood, fruit or iron. Acamana should be performed with water from a copper vessel. Atri (153) proscribes that no food should be served from an iron vessel; if so served the food is like ordure to the diner and the server goes to hell. The vessels for cook iog śrāddha food are to be made of gold, silver, copper or bell metal or even of clay provided the last are new ones and strong (well baked) but never of iron. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 155 for details. The Vigpu Dh S. (79, 24) quotes a verse which says that food offered in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or of phalgu wood becomes inexhaustible. 

Vispu Dh. S 79. 11 provides that for unguents ( anulepana) to be applied to the bodies of the invited brāhmanas, sandal vood, saffron, camphor, aguru, padmala may be used. The Brahmapurāna (220. 165–166) mentions kustha, jaţā-mansi, nutmeg, ušira, mustā and some others as proper perfumed articles to be used at śrāddhas, 

It has already been seen at pp.413-14 what kinds of food were recommended or condemned for śrāddha. The Matsyapurāpa 948 states that food containing milk and curds and clarified butter from cow's milk mixed with sugar gives satisfaction to all pitrs for one month and that whatever food, whether cow's milk or ghee or rice cooked in milk, is mixed with honey, yields jnexbaustible results. The Brahmapurāpa also (220. 182-184) provides that such eatables as are sweet and oily and are slightly sour and pungent should be served in śrāddha and one should slun eatables that are very sour or very saltish or very puogent, since they are usu'a (fit for asuras). Great emphasis was laid on serving preparations of food made from māsa

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. beans. The Aušanasa 749--smrti pronounces the threat that the brāhmana, who, when dining at śrāddha, does not sat māsa food, becomes a boast for twenty-one births after death. The Sm. O. quotes a smrti text saying that a śrāddha in which no māsa preparation is offered is as good as not performed. 

The greatest divergence has prevailed about the employ ment of Desh at śrāddbas among writers from the earliest times. The subject of flesh-eating in general has been discussed at great length in the History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. II pp 772-782. A few remarks about flesh in relation to śrāddla will not be out of place here. The Āp. Dh. S. prescribes 950 that the obli gatory śrāddha (to be performed every month) must contain food mixed with fat, the best course (for supplying fat) is to employ clarified butter and flesh; on failure of these two, sesa muin oil and vegetables may be employed. The same sutra a]so provides 951 that the pitrs are gratified for a year by the offering of cow's flesh in a śrāddha, that by the flesh of a buffalo the gratification of pitrs extends to more than a year, that this rule extends to the flesh of wild animals (like hares) and village (or domesticated) animals (like goats) that are declared to be fit for being sacrificed, that the gratification of pitrs extends to endless time of the flesh of a rhinoceros is offered to brahmanas seated on rhinoceros skin, so also by the flesh of the

fish called 'satabali' and the flesh of a Varddha inasa. Vas. XI. 34 contains the following remarkable verse: 'an ascetic, when invited in a rite for the gods or pitrs, who avoids (does not partake of) flesh, dwells in Hell for as many years as the number of hair (on the body of the animal whose flesh he avoids).' Even the Vishudharmottarapurāpa (1. 140. 49-50) emphatically asserts that he who does not partake of flesh-food in a row of diners at a frāddha which has been properly em ployed goes to hell Manu V, 35 and Kūrma I. 17.40 contain a similar verse applicable to all those who are invited as brāh manas at a śrāddha The Kürınapurāna II, 22.75 provides that the brāhmana who is employed for the performance of a sraddha and does not eat flesh offered therein becomes a beast for 21 births, Manu III 257 states that the following are said to be proper offerings in a śrāddha by their very nature yiz. food (prepared from nīvāra grain and the like) fit for a forest hermit, milk, soma juice, flesh that does not emit foul smell and unmanufactured salt. An ascetic was ordinarly required not to partake of flesh; but Vasistha insisted on his partaking of it when invited at a śrāddha.

honey, of food fit for hermits (wild corn such as nivūra), the flesh of a red goat, of Mahāšāka (i e. Kālašāka), and the flesh of Vārdhrinasa--these secure inexhaustible fruit There is some divergence of views among the several works. For example, Madu II. 267 and 271, Katyāyana (in śrāddhasūtra 7 ) appear to hold that by offering food prepared from village corn (such as rice, māsa &a) or wild eatables (such as nitūra or fruits and roots) the gratification is only for one month and the flesh of Vārdhripasa produces gratification for twelve years only (and not for all time ). - Visdu Dh, S. 80.10 and Manu III. 270 bring in buffalo flesh and tortoise flesh as giving gratification for ten and eleven month respec tively. Hemādri (on srāddha p 590 ) 953 is careful to point out that these words about the duration of time are not to be taken literally but what is really intended is to convey greater and greater gratification of the pitrs according to the kind of flesh offered. Pulastya quoted by the Mit and Apararka p. 555 provides that a brāhmana should generally or mainly offer at a šrāddha hermit's food, a ksatriya or a vasya should offer flesh, a śüdra should offer honey and all vardas may offer anything else (except these three) which is not forbidden. 954 Whoever may be the offerer, the eater at a śrāddha dinner was to be a brāhmada alone and so it follows that brāhmadas invited to a sraddha by a ksatriya or vaišya had to eat flesh. Yet it is remarkable that even the Mitaksara and the Kalpataru written about 1100-1120 A. D. do not expressly say that in the Kali age flesh-eating at śrāddha is totally prohibited at least for brahmapas. It bas been shown already (H, of Dh. yol II pp. 775-776) that even when animal sacrifices were the order of the day in the Rgveda and the Brāhmadas there was an undercurrent of thought that the offerings of fuel-sticks or of boiled rice when made with heart felt devotion to the gods were as good as flesh offerings for

securing their favour. In course of time that conception grew str. onger and stronger, so much so that Manu (V.27-44 and V.46-47) and Vasistha appear to be in two minds (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 778-780). Gradually the offering of flesh in Madhuparka and in śrāddhas came to be totally condemned in works of the 12th and 13th centuries and onwards as a matter prohibited in the Kali age (Varātithipitrbhyaśca pasūpākaranakriya ). (Vide H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 945-946 and p. 964). Now except among the brāhmanas (in Northern India ) who have no objection to include fish in diet as permissible to them no brāhmana offers flesh in sraddha, The usage of Northern India would be in accordance with the view set out in Brhannāradīya purāna that one should offer honey, flesh and other things according to the usage of the country, as explained by the Prthyicandrodaya. 

Manu (V.11-18) contains long lists of animals, birds and fishes whose flesh was not to be eaten oven by those who were flesh-eaters, 

If a person is destitute, some of the Purāpas such as the Vispu (III. 4.24-30) and the Varaha (19,53-58) mercifully provide in identical 955 verses that instead of entertaining brābmanas with a sumptuous dinner or flesh the poor man may offer only un cooked corn, or some vegetables growing wildly or some slight daksinā if he cannot offer even uncooked food or vegetables, or he may offer a few grains of sesamum (7 or 8) to a brāhmana with water in his folded hands, or grass to a cow enough for one day and if he cannot afford even any one of these, tben he may repair to a thicket of trees, raise his arms so that bis armpits are exposed and loudly address the guardians of the worlds such as the Sun in the following words: 'I have neither wealth zor money nor anything else it to be offered by way of śrāddha; I bow to my pitrs; may the pitrs be satisfied by my devotion; I have stretched these arms in spacel' (lit, the path of the wind).

[Vol. He says 'to Soma drunk by the pitrs, sradhal Adoration!' He says 'to Agni, the carrier of kavja, svadhāl Adoration ! (Thereby) he pleases the fire that pertains to the pitrs. He offers (into fire) three oblations; he puts down (on the darbhas spread on the ground) three pindas. (These) thus come to six in number. Six indeed are the seasons. He (thereby) pleaseg the seasons The seasons are indeed the shining (or divide) pitrs......The darbha grass is cut with one stroke; the pitrs have as it were (passed away) once for ever. He puts down thrice (the pindas) The pitřs are indeed in the third world from here. He (thereby) pleases them. He (the performer) turns his face away (to the north from the south), for the Fathers are shy, He remains with his face turned away till the steam (of the boiled rice of the pindas) ceases to rise, for the Fathers have the steam of rice as their share; he should simply emell (the pipdas). That as if does not amount to eating of non-eating. The pitřs when departing (from the śrāddha rite) take away or grant a valiant son. He cuts off the fringe (of a garment to place it on the pindas), for the share of Fathers is taking away (what is offered). He (thereby) allots their proper share to the pitrs (and dismisses them). When the performer) is in the latter part of life (i e, over 50 years of age) he cuts off hair (from his chest instead of presenting a dasa) At that time he is nearer to the pitrs (when above 50 years of age). He offers adoration, because adoration (namaskāra) is dear to the pitrs, Adoration to you, O Fathers, for vigour; adoration to you, o fathers, for life, adoration to you, O fathers, for sadha, adoration to you, O fathers, for ardour; adoration, O fathers, for the terri ble! O fathers' here is adoration to you. This (pindapitryazña) is indeed a sacrifice of men (i e. sacrifice to departed men) and other sacrifices belong to the gods" In the Tai Br. 1 4 10 the Pitryajña performed in sākame tha is praised (in 2) and further on it is said that Rtus (seasons) are pitrs and they offered pitryajia to Prajāpati, their father. This passage supports the provision made in Manu and some of the digests that the Rtus are to be identified with pitrs and obeisance is to be made to them.%0

Pindapit ryajsia in sat. Br.

The Sat. Br. (II. 4. 2) contains the following somewhat fuller account of the Pjoda-pitryajña, omitting legendary or other irrelevant matters -When the moon is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (the performer of the Darsa sacrifice presents food to the Fathers in each month ...... He Presents it in the afternoon, The forenoon indeed belongs to the gods; the midday to mon; and the afternoon to the Fathers; therefore le presents (food to the Fathers ) in the afternoon, While seated behind the Gārhapatya fire with his face turned towards the south and the sacred thread on his right shoulder be takes that material (for the offering from the cart). There upon he rises from thence and threshes the rice while standing north of the Daksina fire and facing the south. Only once does he clean the rice, for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away. He then boils it. While it stands on (the Daksina fire) he pours some clarified butter on it. After remov ing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two oblations in the fire ...... Here he is engaged in a sacrifice to the Fathers; hence he thereby propitiatos the gods and being permitted by the gods, he presents that food to the Fathers. He offers to both Agni and Soma ,, He offers with the formula "To Agni, the carrier of kavija (what is offered to the Manes), svāhal', 'To Soma accompanied by the Fathers, svāhal' (Vā; S. 29). He then puts the pot-ladle (meksapa) on the fire, that being in lieu of the Svistakrt. Thereafter he draws (with the spliya, the wooden sword) one line south of the Daksina fire, that being in lieu of the altar. He then lays down a firebrand at the further (south) end of the line. For, were he to present that food to the Fathers without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Raksasas vould certainly tamper with it. ... He lays it down with the text whatsoever Asuras roam about being attracted by the svadha (offering to Fathers), assuming various shapes, be they large-bodied or small-bodied, may Agni expel them from this world (Vaj s. II 30)... He then takes the water jar and makes the Fathers wash (their hands) merely saying 'N, N., wash thyself' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N. N. wash thy self (naming the sacrificer's) grandfather; 'N.N., wash thyself

(naming) the sacrificer's great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case, Now those (stalls of sacrificial grass) are sovered with one stroke and cut off near the root; the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men and the root part (of darbhas) to the fathers. Therefore they are cut off near the roots ...... Ho spreads them along with the line with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents (to tlo fathers the three round cakes of rice). He presents thus for the gods they offer thus for men they ladja out; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way; therefore he presents the cakes to the fathers) thus With 'N. N., this for theel' he presents one cake to the sacrificer's father. Some add 'for those that come after thee', but let him not say this, since he himself is'one of those to whom it would be offered in comcuon. Let him therefore merely say 'N, N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's father; "N. N., this for thes' as to his grandfather; 'N N., this for thee' as to his great grandfather He then mutters 'Here, O fathers, rogale your selves; like bu]ls come hither each to his own share!' (Vaj. S. II, 31). Whereby he says 'Eat each his own share'. He then tuins round to the left so as to face the opposite (north) side; for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers), 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail' say some; 'for thus far extends the vital energy'. However, having remained so far a moment-he again turns round (to the right) and mutters "the Fathers have regaled themselves; like bulls they have come each to his own share' (Vāj. S. II. 31); whereby what he says is 'they have eaten each his own share. Thereupon he takes the water jar and makes them wash themselves by pouring water on the pindas), merely saying 'N. N., wash thyself (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N. N. wash thyself' (naming) his grandfather; 'N, N., wash thyself' (naming) his paterna) great-grandfather. Even as one would pour out (water for a guest). When he has taken his meal, so it is here. He then pulls down the tuck (of the sacrificer's garment) and performs obeisance. The tuok is sacred to the Fathers; therefore he performs obeisance to them after pulling down the tuck. ... Six times he performs obeisance, for there are six seasons and the fathers are the seasons, He mutters 'Give us houses, O fathers, for the fathers are the rulers of houses; and this is the prayer for blessing at this saorifioial performance, After the

monthly šrāddha (masi-šrāddba) is the prakrti of Astakā and other grāddbas in which three ancestors are to be invoked. It is as follows. Now then at a Pārvana-śrāddha, or at a śrāddha celebrated for securing some desired object, or at an Abhyu dayika-śrāddha or at an Ekoddistašrāddha, the performer causes to sit down brahmanas who are endowed with learning, nioral character and proper conduct or who are endowed with (at least) one (of these three characteristics), who have been invited already in proper time, who have taken a bath, whose feet are washed (by the performer) and who have sipped water (taken ācamana), as representatives of (or equal to) the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each of the Fathers, or two for each or three for each. The larger the number of brāhmanas invited the greater is the fruit or reward. But in no case (should he invite ) only one for all (the Fathars), or he may invite only one brahmana except at the first śrāddha 967. By the exposition of the Pindapitryajāa the rules for the pārvapa-śrāddha have been declared. Having given water (into the hands of the invited brāhmana or brāhmanas after they sit down) and double-folded darbha blades as a seat (on which the darbhas are to be kept), having again given water to them and having poured water into three vessels of metal (silver &c.), of stone and of earthenware or into three Vessels made of the same substance (out of these three) which are covered over with darbha blades and having recited (over the water in the vessels) the verse 'šanno &c.'

970. The rules about Pindapitryañja bave been set forth in Asv. Sr. S. II. 6 Nārāyana notes (OD Āśy gr. IV 72) that Asyalāyana treats of only the procedure relating to the rite for pitrs and that he does sot at all refer to the digger given to darda or Vaišvadeva brāhmanas at the time of srāddba It is therefore possible that feeding daiva brāhmanas was added to the anciegt ritual, though it must be said that Madu III. 125, Yaj. I. 224-28 and Vas XI, 27 prescribe such feeding. Dr. Caland (10' Abaeocult' p 161 ) asserts that he can prove that the detail of feeding daiva brāhmanes spread from the Sradd basūtra of Kātyāyana to the other sutras and he relies on the fact that Kātyāyana (18 Kandikā 2) prescribes that the yıśve devāb sbould be lovoked with the verse Viśve devāsa āgata' and the performer should mutter the verse viśve devāh śrontemam' which are respectively Vāj S. VII, 34 and XXXIII 53. But Dr. Caland tries to prove too much. The first verse occurs twice in the Rg. (II 41, 13 and VI 52 7) and the second occors 10 Rg. VI, 52 13, Tai S II 4 14 5, They are not found only in the Vaj. S as Dr. Caland seems to bave thougbt It is possible that other works took over those waatras from the Rgveda or the Tai S It may also be Boted that Yaj, I, 229 mentioøs only 'Viśve devāsa' and specifies that it is a rk (and not a mantra or yayas).

When he sees that the brāhmapas are satiated (with the food served at the dinner) he (the performer) should recite to the brahmanas the verses containing the word 'madhu' (Rg. I 90.971 6-8) and also the verse 'they have eaten, they have enjoyed them se)ves' (Rg. I 82.2). Having asked the brāhmapas 'was the dipner perfect?' (they should reply that it was) and then having taken (portions of) the different foods that were enjoyed by the brāhmanas together with the sthālīpāka food in order 978 to make lumps (pindas) thereof he should present all (the rest of the food) to the brāhmanas.

From considerations of space it is impossible to set out all the differences among the several grhyasūtras of the Rgveda, of the Taittiriya Sakhā (viz. Bauāhāyana, Āp, Hir., Bharadvāja and Vaikhānasa), of the Vajasaneya sakha (such as Sraddhasūtra of Katyāyana), of the Samaveda (such as Gobhila and Khādira) and of the Atharyaveda (being Kaušika sūtra) A few matters may be set out by way of illustration. The Ap. gr. (21. 3-4)981 states that (after the brābmapas are invited for śrāddha dinner) from the food prepared for the dinner a portion is taken out in a vessel and therefrom seven alutis are cast into the fire with the goven mantras beginping with 'yan me mātā' (in Āp. M. P. II. 19, 1-7), the first two for the father, the next two for the grand-father, next two for the great-grand-father and the 7th to pitrs in genera] with svāhā (but without naming any one) and then six oblations of clarified butter are offered with the six formulas beginning with 'svāhā pitre' (Ap. M. P. I. 19 8-13). Thus the agnaukaraba in Āp consists of two parts viz, āhutis of food and of clarified butter, while in Ašv it is made only with food. Then the performer should touch all food (cooked food and the remainder of what is employed for offering into fire ) with the three mantras esa te tata madhumān' (Ap M. P. II. 19.14-16), he should make the brāhmadas touch the food served to each with the Yagus formula 'the earth is thy vessel' (Ap. M.P. 2. 20.1) quoted in n. 992 below, 

Ap. gr. prescribes the mantra, 'putran pautrān' (Ap. M, P, IL 20, 24) for moistening the pindas, while Baud. gr. and Vaikhānasa gr. (IV.6) employ the mantra 'ürjam yahantir' (Vāj. S. II. 34) for the same purpose. It may be noted that 

980 a. It will be noticed that Ašv. omits several details viz. (1) he does pot say that the brāhmaṇas for all the gods are to be seated, faciag the east, (2) he mentions no mantra such as 'ye agardadghā &c ,' (3) nothing is said about dakpanza or about the performer following the brāhmagas a føve paces and then returning with their permission, 

981. The 374. I 20.9 sets down the whole procedure very succinctly after the brahmanas have taken the dinner as follows: भुक्तवतोनवज्य प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य द्वैध दक्षिणामान दर्भान संस्तीर्य पूत्तरैरपो वचोत्तरैर्दक्षिणापवर्गात पिण्ठान दत्त्वा पूर्ववधुतल्यो इत्वोत्तरैरुपस्थायोत्तरयोदपात्रेण त्रिः प्रसष्पं परिविच्य न्युज्य पानाण्युत्तरं यजरनवान पवारा. र्थमावयित्वा मोक्षप पात्राणि इन्द्रमायुदाहत्य सर्वतः समनदायोत्तरेण यजुषा शेषस्य प्रासा.

Pārvana-sraddha in others sūtras 

439 

these gūtras which belong to the Taittirlya sakha employ a verse from another recension vit, the Sukla Yajurveda 

The Hir. Gr. (II. 10-13) is more elaborate than the Ap. Gṛ. and not only sets out at length many of the mantras in Āp. M. P. II. 19-20, but adds some more. The Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyada (1-3) sets out the procedure of the monthly sraddha almost in the same way as the Yājñavalkyasmrti (which is set out below). It states that in the monthly śrāddha first come the daiva rites and then the various items ocour as in the Pinda-pitryajña 'pindapitryajña-vad-upacārah' (first sūtra of the 2nd kandikā) some details which it contains (and Yāj. does not expressly mention) may be set out here. It gives in full the mantras 'tilosi', 'yā divya' (both of which occur in Asy, gr.), 'prthivi to patram' (which is Āp. M. P. II. 20.1). It prescribes that in addition to the Gayatri and the Madhumati Verses the word 'madhu' should be repeated thrice. The holy texts to be repeated while the brāhmanas are engaged in eating according to Kātyāyana are the Gāyatrī (once or thrice), the five Rāksoghni verses (Rg. IV. 4. 1-5, Vāj. S. XIII, 9-13, Tai, S. I 2. 14, 1-2), Purusasūkta, the Apratiratha hymn (Rg. X. 103, 1-13 = Vā), S. 17. 33-34, 46 = Tai, S. IV. 6.4 1--4) and others, Tt expressly states that the svadhāvācana (Yāj. I 244) relates to both paternal and maternal ancestors. Besides the blessing contained in Yāj I 246, Kātyāyana provides that the performer is to pray for and the brabmanas are to pronounce two more viz, 'May the pitȚs be kind (lit not dreadful) to us' and 'May our family prosper'. Dr Caland in his learned work 'Altindi scher Ahnencult' (pp. 150-152) appears inclined to hold that when a sūtrakāra has not actually said anything on certain iteins in the śrāddha ritual, one has no right to anticipate, on the authority of later authors, that those items existed in the times of that sūtrakāra, I demur to this conclusion, Dr. Caland has attached no weight to the fact that Jaimini (as stated in H. of Dh, vol III p 870) laid down the principle that one may include certain items from another sākhā. Jaimini's sūtras cannot be supposed to have laid down those propositions for the first time. Jaimini's sūtras are at least as old as some of the extant srauta sūtras such as that of Kātyāyana Therefore hardly any chrono logical conclusions can be drawn with certainty from the silence of a sūtrakāra as to a certain item in the śrāddha ritual. 

We shall now turn to the metrical smrtis. Manu treats of the procedure of śrāddha at some length in III. 208–265, But

(Vol. as the procedure prescribed by the Yājñavalkyasmrti (L, 226–249) is more compact and at the same time more lucid it is set out here. "When the invited brābmanas come in the afternoon the performer having a partra 982 in his hand should seat them on seats and make them sip water. The brahmanas invited should be even in number (2, 4 &c.) according to the performer's re sources at the darva rite (i. e, the Vaišvadavika brāhmadas should be two, four &c.) and uneven (three or five &c.) at & (pārvapa) śrāddha for the pitts; the brālmanas should be seated in a pure (covdunged) plot screened on all sides and sloping towards the south. At the darva (part of pārvad& śrāddha yhen Viśpe-devāh are to be invoked) two brāhmanas facing the east should sit down and three brāhmaṇas facing the north should be seated in the rite for the pitrs or only one may be seated for each (i, e. in darva and in patrya), The same rule applies to a śrāddha for waternal ancestors. In both (pitrśrāddha and mātāmahaśrāddha) the worship of Viśve devas may be performed separately or simultaneously 983.

After serving the food in the plates, he should invoke over the plates the mantra 'the earth is thy992 support', he should take hold of the thumb of the brāhmanas and put it on the food (served in the plates) with the mantra 993 'idam Visnur' ("Visnu strode over this' Rg, I. 22. 17, Vāj. S. V. 15, Tai 8. I, 2, 13, 1). The performer should then mutter the Gāyatrī verse (Rg. III 62. 10, Vā). $. ILI, 35, Tai, S. 1. 5. 6. 4) together with 'Om' and the 

Vyübrtis' and the three yerses begianing with 'Madhu pāta' (Rg. I, 90, 6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27-29, Tai. S IV.2 9.3), he should say 'partake (of the food) as you please' and the brahmanas also should eat the food silently, He should serve without anger or bustle food fit for being offered as havis (in a śrāddha) and liked by the brāhmanas till they are satiated (so that some food is left in their plates) and should repeat (while the brāh mapas are engaged in eating) sacred texts and the texts for Japa (Gayatri &c. already referred to in Ya] I. 239 above). The sacred texts to be repeated according to the Mit on Yāj. I. 240 are the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90.* 1-16), the Pāvamani verses (i. a. Terses like 'syādisthayā madisthaya' from the 9th mandala of the Rgveda as stated by Medhātithi on Manu III 86 and Haradatta on Gautama (19. 12). Mapu II. 232 mentions other works for recitation such as the dharmaśāstras, ākhyānas, itibāsa (Mahābhārata), puradas and khilas (like Srisūkta and Vidyāsükta).

It may be that the japa of sacred texts is to be done by the performer wearing the sacred thread in the upavita way as stated by Hemādri p. 1070 and the Madana-pārijāta p. 599, but the Śrāddhatattva (p. 231) is opposed to this and relies on Manu II, 279. Certain Verses from the Purāpas also are to be recited such as the verses from the Varābapurāna (14. 26-31) and Vispupurāna (II, 15. 31-36, which are identical with the preceding) quoted by the Kalpataru on śrāddha (p. 197), Aparārka (p. 502) and Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 109), the first and last of which are quoted in the note belos 994. The Garudapurāda (Ācārakhanda 218.20 ff.)prescribes that while the brāhmanas are eating one may recite a eulogy of prips such as the 'saptavyādha' verses 994a. Then, after holding the food in his hands, the performer should ask the brāhmadas "are you satisfied' (and after they reply that they are satisfied) he should tell them that there is food still left (and ask them what to do with it) and after taking their per

On these the T (p. 231) says "GETTATATHMATE HEATSTOOTER सप्तन्याधा इतिच पठ्यते". These very verses occur in the अग्निपुराण chap. 117. 56–57. The story is very clearly set out in art 1, Chapters 21-24 and the Matsyapurana chap 20-21. Seved pupils of Garga guarding their guro's cow thought of eating that cow as they were famisbed, But the youngest said 'let us make use of the cow's flesh in sraddha, so that we may be saved from sin', Two of the brothers became daiva brābmanas, three became pitr-brābbanas, one became the giver and the 7th became a guest, They told the guru that the cow was eaten by a tiger They passed through several births first as seven hunters, then deer in Kalajara bill and so on 

Sraddha ultimately saved them. The same story is DarTated in Padma V. 10.49-125, and V, 47.282-304 (in which last the disciples are said to have been those of E) After becoming hamsas three of them became Lings (a king and two ministers, acc. to fit) and cared not for the other world. The four others knew the path to moksa, sent word to the three with these verses saying that they four had started on the long road to the other world (PEAT , ) and asking the other three not to be immersed in the mire of wordliness (74... ). The story also occurs in the fragreret (SATHICAT Chap. 41.24 ff). It is interesting to aote that in the faina Uttaradhyayana-sūtra (S. B. E vol. 45 p 56 ) the echoes of this story of the brothers are beard for illustrating the influence of karman,

Many of the Puradas contain detailed descriptions of the śrāddba to be performed on every amāvāsyā; for example, Matsya 17. 12-60 (closely resembling Yāj. 225-259), Vispu purāna II. 15. 13-49, Mārkandeya 28 37-60, Kūrma (IL %%. 20-62), Padma (srstikhanda) 9. 140-186), Brahmānda (Upod ghatapada, cbap, 12), Skanda VI. 224. 3-51, Vishudharmottara I 140, 6-44. The Agpipurāna chap. 163 verses 2-42 are the same (vith very slight variations and the omission of 23 verses) as Yāj. I. 227-270; while Agni cbap. 117 contains many yerses that closely follow the Asy. Gr and Yāj, Similarly the Garuda purāpa contains numerous verses that are identical with Yajnavalkya's. For example, compare Yaj. I, 229-239 with Garuda T. 99. 11-19. The Purāpas closely follow the Grbya sütras, Manu and Yājñavalkya and often employ the same mantras and formulas, though here and there they introduce some details. As remarked by the Varāhapurāna 1451, the procedure for śrāddha is the same in all Paradas ( iyam sarva purānesu sāmānyā paitriki kriya). For sample, a summary of the procedure in the Padma (ersti 9. 140-186) is set out here, The performer having honoured the Viśve-devah (i e, the brāb mana or bralmanas invited to represent them) with a seat and with yava grains and flowers should fill two yessels vith water and should place them on a pavitra of darbhas The water should be offered with the verse "šam no depir' (Rg. X, 9.4) and the yava grains with 'Yaposi'. Theyo should be invoked with the verse 'Vißve devāsah' (Rg. IL 41 13) and yayas should be scat tered about with the two verses "Viśve devāsah' (Rg. II. 41. 13-14) and be should scatter about yara grains with the verse 'thou art gaya, the king of grains &c.' ( quoted 1003 below). After decking the brāhmanas with sandalwood paste and flowers

After taking leave of the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas that have been honoured with arghya he should begin the pitr yazña, He should prepare seats with darbhas on them, worship three vessels, place pavitras on them and pour water in them with 'śam no devir' (Rg. X. 9 4), should oast gesamum grains in them with 'tilosi' and then put in them sandalwood and flowers, (Then verses 147-152 speak about the vessels to be employed). He then should announce the names and gotra of his ancestors and give darbhas in the hands of the brāhmanas. He should then request brāhmapas vith the words 'I shall invite the pitrs' and when they reply 'let it be so' he should invoke the pitrs with the two verses 'usantas tvā' (Rg. X. 16.12) and 'ā yantu' (Vaj. S. 19.58). Then, having offered ar ghya to the brāhmadas (representing the pitrs) with.'yā divya' (vide 2. 985), having given them sandalwood pasto and the other things including garment as the last, he should collect the remainder of the water (in the argiya vessels) into the vessel neant for the father and should keep aside the latter to the north with its top turned downwards with the words 'thou art a seat of the pitrs'. Then he should begin to serve various kinds of food after bringing the utensils in which the food was cooked and holding them with both hands. (Verses 157-165 speak of the various foods to be offered and the periods of gratification caused thereby to the pitrs).

It should be noticed how closely the Padmapurana follows the procedura (including the mantras ) contained in Yajna. Yalkya. What procedure the author of a Purana follors depends upon his learning and the sūtra that he studied. For example, the Visgudbarmottara 1140 appears to rely on the Āp gr. and the Ap. M. P. (IL 19-20), since I 140.12 refers to Āp M.P. I. 19.1 , 1. 140, 29-30 to Ap. M. P. I. 19. 14-16, I, 140.35 to Āp M P. I 20.1. Similarly, Skapda (VI 224 3-51) closely follows Āśv. go and Yāj. 

Oring to the difference in details of śrāddha in the several gshyagübras, the smrtis and the purānas, an important question arises whether a person should perform a śrāddha rite only in Bocordance with the grhyasūtra of his own Veda or Sabhā or whether he may perform it after the inclusion (upasainhāra) of

the several items found in other sūtras and smrtis though not included in the kalpa or grhya sūtra of his own Sākhā, This topic is discussed at great length by Hemādri (on śrāddha ) pp. 748–759 and briefly by Medhatithi on Manu II, 29 and XI. 216, by the Mit on Yāj. IIL 325, Aparārka p. 1053 and others. Those who are for strictly following the details in one's own sutra alone argue as follows: If one were at liberty to include details other than those contained in one's own sūtra, the order of the details (lama) given in one's sūtra and the time specified for each detail would be interfered with Besides, if the addition of details were permissible, one would be liable to the charge of giving up the usages of one's own family handed down for generations. These objectors rely upon such passages as that of the Visnudharmottara which states 'He who violating ( the dictates of) his own sūtra acts according to & sūtra meant for others, treats thereby his own sage ( the author of his sütra) as unauthoritative and incurs ( the blame of doing what is in proper,'1010 The smrtis that contain additional details may be meant for those men who have no kalpa or grlıya sūtra of their own or they may be useful for sūdras. 

Those who espouse the view that as far as possible all details found in several grhyasūtras and smrtis on one rite should be included by every one rely mainly on Jaimini II. 4.8-33 which is called 'sākhantarādhikarapanyaya' or 'saryaśākhāpratyaya nyaya'. The principal sutra is Jai. II, 4. 9.1011 It is established in this sūtra that the prayorana (purpose ) or phala (reward to be secured) of the rite is the same in different sūtras and smrtis. For example, the rewards of śrāddha are stated to be the same in all sūtras and smrtis (vide notes 787–790 above); then the dravia (materials) and the deity are the same (in Pārvana śrāddha the deities are the paternal ancestors and the materials,

vir, kursas, tilas, wator, vog50]s, foods &o, are the same in all works). Tho effort that is enjoined (the vidhz) is the same and the noino (Pūı vanasruddha, Ekoddista śrāddha &c.) is the same. Thorofore, on account of those various signs one easily recog nixos that the samo rito is being dealt with by all sütras, even if many of them differ in dotajls. It cannot be said that surtis vill ho usoful for those who havo no sutras of their own. Each man of the first three varnas is attached to some sülra or other by tho trodition of his family or caste. Similarly, the sportis cannot bo bold to be meant for śüdras alone, since the smrtis miainly doal with ipanayana, the study of the Vedas, agnihotra and other matters with which a šūdra has no concern. Similara ly, the ohjoction that if dotails were allowed to be inserted from othor sûtras and smrtis tho krama and küla prescribed in one's sūtra might have to be set aside, the reply is contained in Jai. I 3.5-7 (explained at groat length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 841-848) 1012 The fruli says 'after getting ready a bundle of kuśa grass he prepares the zedi (altar)'. Here a certain order of acts is laid down, If after a bundle of kušas is got roady, the man has a sneezo, he has to sip water (perform ūciniana ) immodiately as laid down by Manu V. 145 and Vas. UI 38 before he prepares the vedi. So the objector says the krana will be intorfored with. The reply is that the sequence (krama) is only a characteristic of the items in the śruti passage, that all that is meant is that the making of the altar follows the getting ready of a buśa bundle, but that it is not meant that the making of tho vedi should follow immediately after the bundle is got ready. Therefore, the conclusion is that whatever detail is not in conflict with one's own sakhā or sütre may be in oluded in the rite one is about to perform, but if there is a direct conflict, then one should stick to one's own sütza. Ar observed by Katyayana whatever is declared, whether in great detail or in brief, in one's own grhyasūtra about a rite, if he performs that much, it may be taken that he has done all that is required of bim; but what is not handed down in one's sakhā (or sūtra) but 18 contained in another sākha and is not in conflict with one's Dgn sākha, should be performed by the learned, as in the case of

Egnihotra and the like'. 1913 The first verse of Kātyāyana may be explained as applying where one's sākhā or sūtra deals with a matter without requiring any addition or as the next best course where one is not able to supplement one's sūtra owing 

The to some unseen cause or owing to human difficulties. Sangraha says that where different items of the śrāddha rite are declared to be performed at different times and there is no agreement among the sages, one should follow one's grhya sūtra, but where one's grhyasūtra is silent as to a certain item or as to the stage when it is to be performed, there is an option and one may follow the opinion of some sage as to that item. 1014 It appears that even the ancient grhya sūtras exhibit tendencies that led to the sarvasakha-pratyaya-nyaya e. g. Asv. gr. (g. in n 966) employs several passages (such as Tilosi', 'Ya. divya,' which do not occur in the Rgveda.) 

It is owing to this maxim of 'sarvasākhā-pratyayanyāya' that medieval digests go on heaping up details from all smrtis and purānas in their descriptions of the several grāddbas, the procedures of which were not originally very extensive. 

The Kūrmapurāna 2015 provides that the performer should before noontime is past bring to his house the invited brāhmanas

(VOL who have shaved themselves and pared their nails, should offer them materials for brushing the teeth and request them to sit down on separate seats, then give them oil and water for bathing. It will be seen that hero the purāpa has added several details that were not provided for by the Aśv. gr. (1, 966), Manu (III. 208 ), Yaj. (1 226) and even by some of the puranas such as the Varaha 14, 8, which begin the procedure with seat ing the brāhmanas in the afternoon on seats after welcoming them. Many more examples could be given, but that attempt is not made owing to considerations of space. 

Before proceeding to give some idea as to how the pārvana śrāddha was dealt with in medieval and modern times, observa tions must be made on several relevant matters, on which there is a difference of views or which are important in a general way. 

When the invited brābmapas come after noon, it is pro vided in some of the purānas that two mandalas should be made in front of the performer's residence for receiving the brāh madas. For example, the Nāradapurāna states 1016 the mandala for a brāhmana performer should be square (four cornered) in size, for a ksatriya triangular, circular for ā vaisya and for a śüdra mere sprinkling of the ground with water is enough.' The mandalas should be made on ground smeared with cowdung and with water mixed with cow's urine. Of the two mapdalas one should be on the northern side sloping towards the north and the other on the southern side sloping towards the south. On the northern mandala kušas with points towards the east should be placed along with aksata (unbroken or whole) grains and on southern one double-folded kušas should be placed along with sesamum grains. The northern mandala should generally be two cubits on each side while the southern one should be four cubits on each side. The brahmana or brābmanas that repre sent the Visiedevāh should be honoured in the northern mandala first by the performer himself with water for washing their feet after bending his right knee and the brābmapas representing the pitrs should be then honoured in the southern mandala with water for washing the feet (hence called padya) after bending his left knee. The mantra at the time of offering põdya is 'san

The anoient sūtras and smrtis liko those of Manu and Yaj. (T. 229) say generally that the Viśvedevāh are to be invoked, but some of the later smigis (such as Prajāpati, versos 179-190) and puradas contain verses onumorating ten names of Viśve devās and assiga two bach (out of the ton) to five olassos of śraddhas They say: 1019 "in śrāddha performed in an eşti tho V2svedevas kre Kratu and Dakşa, in & Nāndimukha sraddha they are Vasu and Satya, in Kainyaśrāddha Dhuri and Locana, in naimittika sraddha Kala and Kāma and in Parvana-śraddha Purüravas and Ardrava'.

The general rule is that the Vaidyadeva brāhmanas are to be seated facing the east and the patrya brāhmanas facing the north (Yāy I. 228, Varāha 14. 11), but there were at least five differing views about the directions which the brābmanas were to face as Hemādri (on sraddha p. 1200) points out. It is fur ther pointed out by Kemādri and others (like Yāj I. 247) that in a]] items in the procedure of grāddha the Vaišvadevika brāhmanas have precedence except in the matter of washing the hand smeared with the remains of food and the final dismissal of the brāhmanas at the end of the śrāddha,1019 It may be noted that in southern and western India brāhmanas invited at śrāddha are worshipped, while in Bengal it is the effigy made with darbhas (darbhabatu) that is worshipped as shown by the late M. M. Haraprasad Shastri (Catalogue of Mss. vol. III p. 406). The Srāddha-tattya (folio 2b) of Raghunandana provides for the game; 'purītavā-mādravason vśvesām devānām pārvana-śrāddham Icusamayabrāhmane karsye ite prochet.' 

In the Vāyupurāba2020 it is stated that the following mantra should be repeated thrice at the beginning and end of a śrāddha and at the time of offering pindas ; on repeating it the pitrs come quickly to the sraddha and rāksasas run away and that the mantra saves the pitrs in all the three worlds. The mantra is 'Perpetual adoration to the gods, to pitrs and to the great Yogins, to svadbā, to svāha'. The Sra C (on śrāddha

A certain order of words about referring to the ancestors in offering a seat, offering kušas on seat, and arghya is laid down by Brhaspati, 101 some of the purāpas and the digests. As altnost in every case there are different views here also. Bṛhaspati says: "when giving a seat, when offering argiya, or pindas, in offering ablutions of water on pindas, the performer has to declare his relation to each of the ancestors, the names and gofras of the ancestors and also the form if which each of the ancestors is to be contemplated (viz as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya respectively). It is further laid down that the genitive is to be employed for the ancestor's name in offering a seat (to the pitrya brāhmaṇa) and aksayyodala, the objective in invoking the pitrs, the dative in offering food, the vocative in other cases. 

It is laid down that the performer has to take ācarana (sip water) in śrāddha rite sic times viz., at the commencement of śrāddha, when washing the feet of invited brahmanas, in wor shipping them, in making the urkera, in offering pindas and at the end of the sraddha 1022

(śrāddha pp. 447 449), Sr. Pr. pp. 30-31 for a discussion of these two yiov points. It should, however, be noted that the water giren to the brahmanas and the dal sınā given to them were only meant for the brāhmanas, the former for purification and the latter for the inexhaustible merit that daksidā to brahmapas conferred. 

It is to be noted that in the invocation (aralana) of the pitis there is a divergence of views as to the mantras to be employed and also as to the stage when it is to be made, Henādri (śrāddha, pp. 1254-56) states that there were five different views on the latter point, the three most important of which were that āvāhana should come before giving darbhas as āsana on the left side of the seats of the patria brāhmanas or after giving such darbhas or after agnaukarana. As regards the former (viz, the mantras), Yā). (1 232-233), the Brahmanda purana and several others say that the invocation mantra is "ušantas-tya' (Rg. X 16. 12, Val. S 19 70, Tai S 1. 6.12.1) and after the āvāhana the performer should perform japa of the verse'a yantu nah' (Vāj. S. 19, 58 ). The Vispudharma sūtra 102!

The Mit points out that if a man has kept srauta fires by the sarvadhāna method then in the pārvana-śrāddha that he offers after pipdapitryajāa he offers homa in the Daksināgai, as he has no aupāsana (i, e. grhya) fire and supports this by quoting a passage which occurs in the Visnudharmottara-purāna, 1025 But if a man consecrates the śrauta fires by the ardhādhāna 1026 method, then he has to offer pārvana homa in the aupāsana fire and one who is without śrauta fires and has kept up only aupāsana fire has to offer homa in that fire, One who has neither the śrauta fires por the grhya fire offers it in the brāhmana's hand only. The Mit. relies on Manu IIL. 212 and on two verses from a grhya and comes to the conclusion that one who has consecrated srauta fires performs homa in daksina fire in the case of Anyastakya śrāddha, the śrāddha on the day previous to Astakā, the grāddha

performed in the dark half of each month on some day from the 5th and in the case of pārvana-śrāddba, but he performs, in the case of kümya, ābbyudayika, Ekoddista and Astakā grāddhas, homa only on the pitrya brāhmana's hand; while for one who has kept no sacred fire the lama is to be made only in the pittya brāhmana's band. Vide Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1328-1344), Balambhatti (on ācāra p. 518). The Todarādanda (śrāddba saukuya ) following Manu TII, 282 states that one who is an Agnihotrin cannot perform a pāryana-śrāddha on any day except on darsa (i. e, on amāvāsyā). 

Another important question on which thero is great diver gence concerns the number of abutis to be offered in agnau harana, the deities to whom the loma was to be offered, the order in which the deities were to be named and the form of words to be used. On those matters there appears to have been divergent views from very ancient times. According to the Sat, Br. II. 4. 2. 12-13 the āhutis were only 1027 two, they were offered to Agni and Soma in that order and the word svāhā was used at the end. According to the Tai. Br I 3. 10.2-3 2028 the khutis were three, they were to be offered to Soma, Agni and to Yamna in that order and the formula ended with 'syadha namah (and not with 'svāhā '). It is therefore that a verse of Katyā yana 1029 says " whether to employ the yord 'spāhā' or the words * svadhā namad', whether and when to wear the sacred chord in the yajñopavita form or prācināvita form and what was to be the number of ahutis-all these have to be understood from one's own sūtra," The difference of views which is noticed as far back as the Brāhmanas persists in the sūtras, smartis, purānas and is briefly indicated here. The Āp. Gr S. (quoted above in 17. 981 ) speaks of thirteen āhutis, seven with food and

It is here that various combinations of the order of the deities and of the words 'svaha' and 'svadha' occur. The texts of a few works are cited below for illustration. Some give the order as 'Soma accom panied by the pitrs, Agni the carrier of havya, Yama Angiras;' while others give it as 'Agni the carrier of kavya, Sona accompanied by the pitrs, Yama Vaivasvata &c,' It is further provided that the āhuiz to Agni is made to the southern side of the fire, to Soma on the northern part of it and in the middle of the two sides to Vaivasvata (Yama ).1033 

Various rules of etiquette about serving food, about the way brahmapas are to eat and related matters have been laid down from ancient times and are observed even now. The Sm, C (p.465-470), Hemadri (raddha pp. 1367-1384), the Sr. Pr. pp. 116-123 and other digests contain elaborate rules on these 

matters. Yaj.I. 237 prescribes that what remains after offering homa should be served in the plates meant for the brahmanas representing the Fathers and the plates should preferably be

of silver, Katyāyana says that the performer who has no fire (either srauta or smārta ) should offer the homa on the hand of the most eminent among the pitrya brahmanas to the accom paniment of a mantra and should offer the remainder in the plates of the other pitrya brāhmadas.103: The Sm. O. notes that Yama and the Vayupurāpa say that the homa should be in the hand of the daiva brābmana and that on account of this conflict there is an option. It is further provided that a portion of the food from which agnaukarana was effected should be kept aside for making pindas (Mārkandeya and Garuda). The food should be served by the performer himself wearing the sacred thread in the vajšopavita form or by his wife of the same oaste or by some attendant who is purified, Manu (IIL 224-229, 231-233, 236-238) contains several rules 1032 "Himself holding the vessels full of food with both hands the performer should slowly place them near the brābmapas seated for dinner while think ing of his ancestors. That food, which is brought near the brāhmades without (the containing vessel being held in) both lands, is snatched away by wioked asuras. The per former being himself pure and concentrating his mind (only on the serving of food ) should place the vessels containing the

Rules about serving food. side dishes viz. brotlıs, vegetables, milk, curds, gheo and honey on the ground (and not on a wooden stool or the like ). The vessels placed on the ground should contain various kinds of food (such as sweetmeats, pāyasa), fruits and roots, delicious flesh, spiced or perfumed drinks. Having brought near the brahmanas all the vessels containing food, he should serve it in the plates declaring the characteristic of each kind of food (saying this is sweet, this is sour' &c.). The performer wliile serying should not shed tears (remembering his ancestors ), be should not become angry, should not utter falsehood, he should not touch the (vessel containing) food with his foot and should not serve food with a violent jerk, Whatever is liked by the brāhmanas should be served to them without any grumbling and he should talk about Brahma ( or about Vedic riddles ), because that is agreeable to the pitrs. The perfornier himself, being pleased, should ( by his sweet speech ) gladden the brāhmadas, should make them partake of food without Jiurty, and should urge them on frequently (to take more food) by declaring the good points of the various items of food. All food should be steaming hot and the brāhmanas should partake of it silently and should not themselves speak of the good points of the food even when questioned by the performer. When the food is hot, when the brāhmanas eat in silence and when the good qualities of the food are not declared by the brāhmanas, the Fathers partake of it. When a brāhmana (at a śrāddha dinner) partakes of food, having his head covered with a garment (& turban &c)or facing the south or having his sandals on, evil spirits partake of the food (and not the Fathers).' As early as Gaut., it is provided that the food for the braumapas should be of the highest sort and should be enriched by condiments and flavoured, 

Some of the other rules are : The Prajāpati-smrti (verses 57-62) states who should cook the food for the śrāddha dinner. The wife, any fortunate (or handsome) woman of the performer's gotra whose husband is living and who has a son or brother and is devoted to waiting upon her elders, the performer's teacher's wife, his maternal uncle's wife, paternal or maternal aunt, bis sister, his daughter or daughter-in-law, all of them having their husbands alive, should engage in the cooking of the food for śrāddha. Women of good family, who have a large progeny, whose husbands are alive and who are about 50 years old or these women if they have become widows, and the wife of one's paternal uncle or brother, one's mothers (natural or

In the Anušāsana parva (92.15) it is stated that a womau bolonging to a gotra other than that of the deceased should not lo employed for cooking srāddha food. One's brother, patornal uncle, brother's son, sister's son, one's son, pupil, one's daughtor's son or daugliter's husband may also engage in cook ing tho srāddha food, but not a woman who wears a white and wet garmont, wlio lias let her hair Joose, who does not wear it biodico, who is ill or who has bathed her head. Before the brahmanas begin to eat, the food should be first served in tlo platos for the Vaisvadeva brāhumanas and then in those of tho po yu hrālmanns (Visau Dh S. 73 13-14), but once the brālimanas havo begun to ent there is no such precedenoe, what cvor ench brāhmana may be noted as requiring should be served to him (as indicated by Manu III. 231 ). The performer of the śrāddho whon sorving food to the brahmanas (including pitrya) wears luis sacred thread in the upavita form Though it is said that tho food should be lot, tliat does not apply to such eatables 25 curds, fruits and roots and flavoured 1035 drinks (as Sankha XIV.13 and Skandapurana say) As Hemādri (śrāddha p. 1371) points out, the sorring of food in a sraddha rite should be done with the rigut hand supported by the left; besides, nothing should be sorved with the bare hand or with a single hand, but with a wooden ladle or otller utensil (but not an iron one). All cooked food, all side dishes and ghee should be served with a ladle (and not with the bare hand ) but not water or eatables like laddus No salt was to be directly served ( Vispu Dh S. 79.12). In Katyāyana's Śrāddha-sūtra it is provided 1036 "The food that remains after agnauharana should be served in the plates of the pitrya brāhmabas and the performer should touch

each plate for those brāhmanas after repeating the mantra 'the earth is thy vessel, the sky is the cover, I offer nectar in the brahmana's nectar-like mouth; svāha'. Then the performer plunges the (right) thumb of the pitrya brāhmana in the food ( the remains of the homa in fire) with the rk or yajus addressed to Visnu; and after scattering sesamum grains all round the place where the dinner is to go on with the mantra * the asuras and rākgasas) are struck and driven away he (the performer ) should serve hot food very much liked (by the departed or by the brahmanas )". Yaj. I. 238 briefly refers (as translated above) to the mantras and the item of plunging the thumb of the brahmanas in the food; and so does the Baud. Dh. S. also (II. 8. 15-16). The Kalika-purana. prescribes1037 that the thumb of the brāhmana should be moved about in the food covered with ghee and honey with the mantra "the earth is thy vessel &c.' because Visnu in the form of the thumb protects food meant for sacrifices to gods and nanes. The Baud. Pitrmedhasūtra provides that while plunging the thumb of the brāhmana in the food served it should be so arranged that the nail of the thumb is not sineared with food. 1038 Vasistha provides that the brahmanas eating śrāddha food should always hold the plate from which they are eating with (the left ) hand till the end of the dinner. Sankha-Likhita provide 1039 that brāhmanas (eating śrāddba food ) should not declare the good or bad points of the food served, should not say what is untrue, should not praise each other, nor should they say there is plenty of food and drink (and so do not serve more food),

History of Dharmadāsira 

(Vol. except by signs made with the hand.' Whatever is offered in a brahmana's hand (by way of agnaukarana) and whatever food is placed in tho plales should be mixed up and eaten. Hemādri quotos passages from the Maitrāyaniya-sūtra and from the Skandapurano setting out the mantras wherewith certain articles were to bo sorved; e. g, the Skandapurāna says that piyasa should be served with tho Verse 'naino vah pitaro' (Vaj. S. II. 32. Tai, S. III, 2.5, 5), clarified butter with the mantra 'Tojosi sukram', curds with the mantra "dadhikrāvno' (Rg. IV. 39. 6, Vaj. S. 23. 32, Tai. S. 1.5. 11. 4). Ap Dh, S. (II. 8. 18. 11) provides that the loavings of a sraddha dinner should not be given to ono who is inferior to the invited brāhmadas in qualition and Manu II. 249 states that the man who after oating srāddha dinnor gives the leavings to a südra falls in the 

Kalasātra Hell. 

The Matsyapurīna and some other works provide that the brālmanas should pronounce blessings on the performer (who faces the east) after they have sipped water and have been given water, flowers and akşata grains. The performer prays 'May our Tatliers be not terrible (i, o, be kind) to us.' The brābmapas reply "lot it be so'. The performer prays "May our family grow', 'May donors increase in our family and also food', 'May these blessings turn out to be true'. To all these the brāhmanas reply after each one of the prayers 1010 May it be so'. There aro rules about the time when the leavings or particles of food in the plates of the brālmadas that ate the dinner should be removed or swept away Vas. (XI. 21–22) and the Kūrma piirāna provide that the leavings of food should not be removed till the Sun sets, since streams of declar flow from them, which are drunk by the (spirits of) those departed persons for whom no vater was offered. Manu III, 265 (which is the same as Matsya 17 56 and Padma, Srstikhanda 9.185) provides another rule that the leavings of the food in the plates may remain where they are till the brāhmanas are dismissed and depart,

Rules about removal of leavings

Hemādri (śrāddha, p. 1512 )1041 therefore provides that if the per former has another house the leavings may not be removed till sunset, but if he has only one house, they may be removed after the brāhmadas have gone away (vide Yaz I. 257, Matsya 17.56 ). It is further provided by Brhaspati 1042 that the plates should not be removed before the brāhmanas Pronounce the word 'svasti', and Jātūkarnya 1043 and the Skandapurāna say that the plates and the leavings should be removed by the performer himself or by his pupil or son, but not by women nor by a child nor by one who is not of the same caste Manu III 258 provides that, after the brāhmanas have left, the performer should look at the south and pray to the pitrs for certain blessings contained in Manu II 259 which are the same as Yāj I 246 translated above (vide p. 447), Vispu Dh, S 73. 28, Matsya 16. 49-50, The Ap. gr. 209 (q. in note 981), Āp Dh. S II 7. 17. 16, Manu II, 264, Yāj. I, 249 provide that the performer should partake of the remainder of the food cooked for the śrāddha along with his wife, paternal and maternal relatives after recit ing (according to Haradatta) the Yājusa mantra (Ap. M, P, IT. 20.26 ) which means 'entering the life breath I offer nectar; my soul is centred in Brahman for the sake of immortality. The Āp. gr and Āp. Dh. 8. provide 1044 that the performer must eat at least a morsel of the food left after serving to the brāhmanas. Vyāsa and Devala prescribe that on the day of śrāddha the per former must not observe a fast (even if he usually does so as on Ekādašī or Sivarātra). A way out was provided by the Bra hmavaivarta-purāna by recommending that the performer should merely smell the remnants of the śrāddha food. Vide

Homidri (Grāddha, pp. 1519-1521 ) for the discussion, Hemādri (p. 1485) refers to the practice (observed even now) that after the porformer receives the blessings referred to above, his son, grandson and the like should offer adoration to the devatās in tho form of pindas. Tho brālımadas should praise the good characteristics of the food servod at the end of the graddha coremony, 5035 The brālmanas should not get up from the dinner, carclosely leaving remnants of food in their plates, but they pay loave in the plates a little food except milk, curds, honoy or barloy flour. 1016 

There were soveral views as to the exact stage at which the offerings of pindas wero to be made, According to Sān. Gr. IV. 1.9., Asy, gr. IV. 8. 12, 2017 Sapkha 14. 11, Manu II. 260-261, Yay, I 242 and several other works, the performer offers the Jumps of boiled rice after the brāhmapas have finished eating their dinner, The pindas aro made with boiled rice mixed with sesame and aro placed on darbhas on a clean spot and at a distance of about one fratni from 1018 the plates in which the brahmadas ato and the performer faces the south. Here again there are two opinions, ono being that pindas were to be offered before the brahmanas sip water (perform ūcamana) after dinner (e. g. Āśv, gr. IV. 8. 12-13, Srāddha-sitra of Kātyāyana, kandika 3), while othors hold that thioy were to be offered after the brāhmapes have rinsed their mouth and taken ūcamana. Another view referred to as the view of some by Sān, gr. IV. 1. 10 and Manu II 261 was that pindas were to be offered to the ancestors first after honouring the invited brāhmanas or after agnaukarana and thon the brābmanas were to partake of the dinner The

Brahmāndapurāna 1019 emphatically asserts that this is the correct position as stated by Brhaspati. The Visnu Dh. S. (73 15-24) provides that the pindas are to be offered to the ancestors while the brāhmanas are actually eating. A fourth view is that of the Ap. gr.24.9, Hir gr. (II. 12.2-3) which state that the per former1050 should, after the brahmanas have eaten and gone away and he has followed and circumambulated them, offer pindas, Owing to this conflict of views Hemādri (quoting smrti) and the Madanapārijāta (p 600) say that each one should follow the procedure laid down in his own sākhā 1051 Hemādri adds that those in whose grhyasūtra no special time is mentioned for pindadāna should follow the view that pindas are to be offered after the brāhmanas have partaken of the dinner and sipped water. The Sr. P. (p. 247) endorses this view.1052 The pindas were to be deposited on bunches of (25) darbhas for each pinda, Aparārka on Yāj. I24 states that in all cases without exception pindas were to be offered near the plates from which the brābmapas took their meals, while Hemādri vho relies on Katyāyana's word 'ucchistasannidhau' says that where the performer is an altāgni the pindas were to be offered near his sacred fire, but when a perfornier had not kept the sacred fires pindas were to be offered near the plates from which brāhmanas. ate the traddha food. The Sraddhasara (p 163) quotes Atri to the effect that pindas should be offered at a distance of three arabnis from where the brāhmapas ate the śrāddha dinner and that in such śrāddhas as Navašrāddhas Vaišvadeva is to be performed before pindadāna and that it is to be performed after

There is another conflict of views as regards the ancestors to whom pindas are to be offered at the śrāddha on amāvāsya. - Most of the ancient Vedic works refer only to the three paternal ancestors as the devatās of the Pārvada-śrāddha and not to any other relatives. The three paternal ancestors are separately the devatās of śrāddha and 20cumulatively, as indicated by the Ašv, Srauta I, 6.15 and Visu Dh S, 73 13-14, The important questions are whether the vives of the paternal ancestors, viz, the mother, the grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother were associated with their husbands in ancient times and secondly, whether the three paternal ancestors of one's mother viz. the maternal grandfather, the maternal great-grandfather and the maternal great-great-grandfather were invoked together with their wives in the Pārvada The answer to both these questions so far as the Vedas and Brāhmanas are concerned is in the negative, Vide Tai, S.1.8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I 3. 10, 11. 6. 16, Vāj. Ś, 19 36-37, Sat. Br, I. 4.2. 16, in all of which the only persons expressly named are the pitis and three paternal ancestors It may be noted, however,

of Srāddhasūtra 3 as the mantra to be recited when following the brahmanas that are dismissed) there is a clear reference to paterna) ancestors and also to mothers Almost a)] sūtras also are silent as regards the invocation of the maternal ancestors in Paryana-śrāddha along with paternal ones. Vide 1053 Aśv, Śr.; Sudarsang on Āp. gr. VII, 21, 2 states that the Sūtrakara and Bhāsgakāra did not speak of Mātāmabaśraddha as it is not obligatory for a daughter's son to offer it, The Sraddhasūtra of Kātyāyana 1054 speaks of three pindas being made for the paternal anoestors and three for the mother's paterna)

ancestors, The Gobhilasmrti provides 1055 that six pindas should be offered except in the Anvastakāśrāddha, the first śrāddha (on the 11th day), the sixteen śrāddhas and the yearly śrāddha for a deceased person. Dhaumya 1056 prescribes that where the paternal ancestors are honoured ( or fed) the mater nal ancestors also should be certainly honoured without making any difference (between the two classes); if he makes a dis tinction the performer will go to Hell. The Visnupurāda, 1057 the Brahwāndapurada and the Varāhapurāpa say that some hold that a śrāddha for maternal ancestors is to be performed separately while other sages hold that one śrāddha is to be offered at the same time to the paternal and maternal ancestors. Brhaspati (q. by Kalpataru on śrāddha p. 204) prescribes 1058 that one should offer pindas made from all food cooked for the 'srāddha and mixed with honey and sesamum grains for both paternal and maternal ancestors according to the rules of one's gruyasutra, The Varāhapurāna (14 40-41) says that pitrya brahmapas should be dismissed first and then the daiva brāh manas together with those for the mother's ancestors and that separate pindas were to be offered to the mother's paternal ancestors (14 37). Some held the view that the offering of pindas to maternal ancestors was obligatory for the putrikā putra 1059 (son of the appointed daughter) or for a daughter's son that inherited the wealth of his material grandfather. Bṛhat-Parāśara (chap. V. p. 153) mentions several views on this point. It seerns probable that when the appointment of a

daughter as a son became rate or went out of yogue the maternal ancestors came to be associated with the paternal ancestors in pārvada-śrāddha. 

The question when the wives of ancestors became associa ted with the male ancestors cannot be solved satisfactorily. The pitamahi is not mentioned in the extant Vedio Literature, But it is certain that the wives of male ancestors had come to be associated with their husbands in the sūtra period. Tor example, the Hir. Gr. I. 10 associates the mother, the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother with their respective husbands in the monthly šrāddha performed in the dark half. Similarly, the Baud. gr. II 11,34 not only associates in the Astaka sraddha the male maternal ancestors with the male paternal ancestors, but also their respective vives. The Ap, M. P. 1060 has mantras referring to the three male paterna) ancestors as well as their wives. The Sān. gr. (IV. 1,11) pro vides that behind the lumps for the paternal ancestors the per former places the lumps for their wives, putting something between the two sets of pindas and the commantator explains that darbhas are placed between the two sets. The Kaušika sūtra (88 12) also provides for the offering of pindas to the wives of male ancestors to the south of the pindas for male ancestors, The Aśv. gr. (II 5.4-5), while speaking of the Anvas. takya rite, refers to pindas to be offered to the wives of ances tors with the addition of rum and the scum of boiled rice. The Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra IV. 7 (after describing the Pinda pitryajña ip IV,5-6) notes that the difference between it and the ordinary monthly šrāddha is that in the latter pindas sro offered to the wives of the pitra 1061 Dr, Caland (in 'Ahnencult' p. 164) thinks that this inclusion of the women ancestors among those to whom pindas were to be offered was made by taking over from Anvastakya ceremonial described above. This con jacture does not look very probable. The Astakā rites existod from remote antiquity as shown above. If the offering of pindas to women ancestors were borrowed from the Anvastakys

ĪV) Participation of females in pindas offered 475 this item would have figured in all sātras just as Astali sra ddha does. It is rather more probable that the extension to women was a natural growth in course of time. Some of the smrtis emphasize the participation of the wives of paternal ancestors in the parmanasraddha offerings. Satatepe states 1062 : 'In what is offered to the pitīs after Sapiod ikaraga, the mother is a participant everywhere. A śraddha may be separately offered to the mother in the Anvastakā rites, in Viddhi-sraddha, at Gaya and on the anniversary of the day of her death; but in other cases it is performed along with the husband'. It is atated by Bfhaspati that the mother partakes of the sizddha food along with her husband (i. e. the father of the performer); that the same rule applies to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother 1005. The Kalpararu 1054 and others held that the wives of the paternal ancestors were not deratas in the pārvana-śrāddha, but they only enjoyed the ethereal food which came to the pitrs, while Hemādri and other sou thera writers held that the mother and other female ancestors were among the devatās of pārvada-śrāddha, but not the steg mother. There was a divergence of views whether the words 'mother', 'paternal grandmother' and 'paternal great-grand mother' included the co-wives (sapatnts) of these. Henadri (on sraddha pp.97-104) has a long disquisition on this question, According to one view the step-mother, the co-wife of the pita mahi and the co-wife of the prapitā mahi would be included in

Mantras at offering pindas - the usage of the Tai. s. in this matter, the reason being 100 that when the son offers a piņda to his father and employs the formula 'this is thine and of those that follow thee', he would be included among those that follow the father and be thus offering a pioda to himself, which is inauspicious. It is provided by Gobbila-grhya 1071 that if he does not know the names of his ancestors he should put down the first pinda with the Formula *svadbā to the Fathers dwelling on the earth', (ho should put down) the 2nd pinda with the formula 'svadbā to the fathers dwelling in the air, the third with the formula 'svadbā to the Fathers dwelling in heaven' and should recite in a low voice the words 'Here, O Fathery, gladden yourselves, show your vigour each according to his own part,' Yama quoted by Kalpataru (on Sr. p 203), following Gobhila provides generally (whether the ancestors be known or not) that the first pinda should be offered to the father with the expression 'prthivi', the second to the grandfather in the aerial regions and the third to the paternal great-grandfather with the mantra 'dyaur darvi, The Visnu Dh.S (73 17-19) has similar provisions, the mantras respectively being 'prthivi darviraksita', 'antariksam darvi raksita,' dyaur-darviraksita... Medhatithi on Manu III. 194 says (following Asv. Sr and others) that if the names of the ancestors are not known he should simply say 'O Father, Grandfather' &c. If the gotra be not known then he should employ the gotra name Kasyapa. 1072

(Vol. size of the pipdas. Marici (quoted by Aparārka p. 507) provides that in pārvana-śrāddha the pinda should be of the size of undried āmalaka fruit, of the size of a bilva fruit in Ekoddista, in navašrāddhas the pinda should be bigger than in any one of the preceding when offered every day during the days of impu rity on death, The Skandapurāda says that pindas should be of such a size as would enable a calf two years old to put it easily into its mouth. 1073 Angiras (q. by Sm. O p. 475 and Hemadri, srāddha p. 1429) prescribes that the pipdas may be of the size of kapittha or bilra fruit or of the size of a hen's egg or of an analala or badara fruit. In the Maitrāyaniya-sūtra 1074 it is said that the pinda for the paternal grandfather shonld be bigger than that for the father and should be in the middle (of the three pindas), that the pinda for the great-grandfather should be the largest of all. The next point is from what materials the pipdas were to be made. If pindas yere offered before agnaularan, they were to be made from the boiled rica (oaru) prepared for agnaukarana. If made after agnankarana, the pindas were to be made from the cooked food (reinaining after agnaukarapa) mixed with sesamum (vide Yaj I 242). If pindas were to be offered after the brahmanas took their dinnor, the pindas were to be made from the remainder of the food cooked for the brāhmanas which was to be mixed with tho boiled rice for agnaukarana as stated in Katyayana's Śruddha sutra. 1975 The pindas vere to be placed according to the Matsya 1076 on darbhas spread on the ground cleaned with water mixed with cow's dung and urine.

The Vayupurāna provides that a line should be drawn on the altar or the ground with the root of a darbha to the accompaniment of the following mantras viz, 1077 'I destroy whatever is impure; I have killed all asuras, danavas, raksasas, yaksas, pisacas (goblins), guhyakas and yātudhānas' and the mantra 'struck down ( are the asuras and raksasas sitting on the Vedi)'. In Ap. Sr. I. 10.2, Manu III 217, Visnu Dh.

In the Saunakatharyanaśrāddha-kalpa, the pindas are offered in the reverse order i. e. first to the great-grand father, then to the grandfather and then to the father (Hemādri on srāddha p. 1442). Āp. Sr. I. 9.4 refers to this method in 'pitamahaprabhrtin Va'.

History of Dharmasastra 

(Vol. 

About the final disposal (pratipatti) of the pindas several views wore entertained. We have already seen (note 780) that the Vāj. S, and several sūtras provided that the middle one of tho threo pindas for paternal ancestors was to be eaten by tho wife of the performer of the śrāddha if she was desirous of a son. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that the dharmapatnī (i. e, a wife of the same varpa and married before any other wife ) should eat the middle pipda with the mantra "adhatta pitaro garbham' (9. in n. 780 ) and then she gives birth to a son who lives long, secures fame, is intelligent and obtains woalth and progony and who is of a good and righteous turn of mind. The same rule is provided for by the Laghu-Āśvaliyana 23,83, the Kūrma II. %. 71, 76, Matsya 16,52, Vāyu 76,31, Vispudharmottara I. 171 8, 220. 149, Padma (srstikhanda 9.121) and other purānas. As regards pindas in general, the Asy. Sr. (11. 7. 14-17) says that the other two pindas (except the middle ono ) should be cast into water or in fire or they may be eaten by a brābmana who lias suddenly developed a distaste for food or they may be partaken by one who has been suffering from & serious disease (such as tuberculosis or leprosy) and that in the latter case the man either recovers or dies. The Gobhila-gr. (IV, 3.31-34) provides that the pindas should be thrown into water or in fire or should be given to a brāhmana or a cow to eat, Manu (HII. 260-261 ) says the same and adds that they may be given to a goat for eating and that some allow them to be devoured by birds Yaj. L 257, Matsya 16,52-53, and Padma 1079 mention the same five ways of disposal but the last adds one more viz, placing them near a mound of earth. The Varalla purāpa 1080 ( 190 121 ) says that the performer may eat the first pinda himself, he should give the middle to his wife and the third he should cast into water. The Anušāsanaparva (125.25.26) provides that the first and the third should be thrown into water or fire and the middle pinda should be eaton by the wife. It is provided by Brhaspati tbat if the wife is suffering from a disease or is already pregnant or is staying in some other

place, then an old bull or a goat may eat the middle pinda (quoted by Sm, C. on Sr. p. 486, Kalpataru on Śr p 224). The Visnudharmottara (L 141, 8) prescribes that when a śrāddha is performed at a tīrtha, the pindas should be cast into the sacred water. The Anušāsapaparva 125. 38-40 and some of the purāpas such as Vāyu (76 32-34 ) and Brahma (220 150-152) provide that certain consequences follow from the disposal of pindas in one way or another viz. the best worlds by giving piodas to cows, intellect and fame from casting into water, long life from offering them to birds &c. Vide also Brahmanda (upodghāta, chap. 12. 31-35) which provides that if given to cows the result is best complexion, if to cocks then delicacy, Jong life if given crows In this connection it should be noted that pindas of rice or of flour were not to be offered in all śrāddhas. The Sraddha-kalpalatā (pp. 86-89 ) has a long discussion about tho śrāddhas in which the offering of pindas of food is forbidden, For example, it quotes Pulastya to the effect that in śrāddhas parformed on the two ayana days, on the two equinoctial days, on any sankrānti, no pindas are to be offered, so also in sraddhas on Ekādasi, Trayodasi, on Maghā and Krttikā naksatras, if a man desires to have sons and wealth, 

On the question as to what is the principal item in the śrāddha there are three views. Some, like Govindarāja, 1981 hold that feeding of brāhmapas is the principal thing and they rely on Manu III. 129 which says 'One may feed even a single learned brāhmana in a rite for gods and manes and not miany who do not know Yedic mantras; by doing so he reaps abundant reward'. Here the reward or fruit is associated with feeding a learned brāhmapa There is a maxim 1082 of the Pūrvamīmāmsā that whatever is mentioned in proximity with an action that has a reward or fruit but has no special revard of its own, is subsidiary (anga) to what is declared to have a reward.' Besides, there is no pipdadāna in certain śrāddhas such as āmaśrāddha, śrāddha on the Yugādi days 1083

[ Vol. Others like Karka hold the view that piodadana is the principal item in śrāddba. They rely upon the fact that in the śrāddha at Gayā it is the offering of pindas that is the most important matter and upon the fact that in the Visnudharmasūtra (78. 52-53, and 85. 65-66) and in several Puranas such as the Varāha (13.50), Visnu (III. 14,22-23), Brahma (220.31-32), Visnu dharmottara (I 145.3-4) the pitrs are stated to have expressed a deep yearning for a son who would offer them piodas at Gaya and water on sacred rivers &c (vide note 911). Further support is sought for this view in the faot that in the śrāddha on the birth of a son and in srāddha offered even by a good būdra the feeding of brālmanas is forbidden. A third view is that both the feeding of brāhmapas and the offering of pindas are the principal matters in a sraddha, The Gobhila-smrti, after stating 1081 the other two views and some of the reasons therefor, tells us that the author of it is himself in favour of this third view. In cases where the word śrāddba is employed and there 18 neither brāhmana feeding nor pipdadāna as in Daiva śrāddha, the word śrāddha is applied in a secondary sense (gauna). Vide Henādri sraddha) pp. 157-160. In the Dharmapradīpa it is said that among the followers of the Yajurveda (i e. Vājasaneyins) the offering of pindas is principal, among the followers of the Rgveda the feeding of brāhmapas is principal, while among the followers of the Sāmaveda both are principal, In this way śraddha partakes of two characters viz it is a vāga (sacrifice) and also 1085 a gift (dāna) Haradatta, Hemādri, Kapardi and others appear to hold that all three (bhojana pindadāna and agnaukarana) are principal. Vide Samskāra ratnamālā p. 1003. 

The Matsyapurāna says in a famous passaga "ancestors from the fourth (i, e, the father, grand-father and great-grand father of the great-grandfather of performer ) are entitled only to the wipings of the articles of food (sticking to

the hand of the performer of śrāddha); the father, (the grand-father and great-grandfather) are entitled to the pinda; the offerer of the pinda is the 7th; thus sapinda relationship extends to seven generations 1086. The Mārkandeya-purapa states that three ancestors beginning from the paternal grand father of the paternal grandfather epioy the wipings (of the hand of the performer when he offers pindas). 1087 The Brahma purāda (220, 84-86) has similar Verses. Manu provided 1088 that the performer should place three pindas on darbhas and then wipe off from his hand the particles of food and water sticking to it with the roots of the darbhas (on which the pipdas were placed) and that such wipings are meant for those who are called 'lepabhāgin' (the three paternal ancestors after the paternal great-grand-father). Similar provisions are made by the Visnu Dh, S. 73.2%, Varāhapurāna 14,36, Garudapurāna (Ācārakānda 21824), Kürma II. 22.52. Medhātithi on Manu IIL 216 says that even if no food or water sticks to the hand still the performer rubs ths hand against the roots of the dar bhas on which the first pinda was placed. A. special rule was, provided by Davala quoted in Srāddhakalpalata (p. 14) that if the father or mother became a mleccha (by forcible or yolun tary conversion &c.) one should not observe any impurity for him or her and no śrāddha should be offered and when offering the three pindas in place of the father the name of Vispu should be uttered. 

One question that exercised the minds of well-known writers was whether the daily Varévaceva should be performed before starting the śrāddha ceremonies or after the latter were finished. We have to remember first that several works state that rites for pitrs deserve pre-eminence over those for the

[Vol. gods 1089, Mañu (IL 265 ) states 1090 that after the brāhmavas have been dismissed the performer of sraddha shall offer the (daily) domestic vali offering and that this is the settled rule of dharma, Medhātithi explains that the word "bali' is meroly illustrative. The Matsyapurāna 1091 17 61, the Varāha purāpa (14.43), Skanda VI. 1. 266. 101-102, Devala, Kārsnājini and others provide that after the rites for the fathers are finished Vaišvadeva should be performed. When Vaišvadeva is performed after the completion of śrāddha rites, it is to be offered from the food that remains after being utilized for the śrāddha dinner. But Hemādri (pp. 1058-1065) holds a long discussion and arrives at the following conclusions In the case of an āhitāgnz (p. 1064), Vaišvadora is to be performed before śrāddha except in the case of the śrāddha on the 11th day after death. In the case of one who has not kept the sacred fires there are three optional times for Vaišvadeva, viz, after agnaukarana or after the vikira (scattering of food on darbhas for those dying without the samskāras being performed for them), or after the brāhmanas are dismissed on the completion of the śrāddha (P 1064), If Vaišvadeya is to be performed before śrāddha or in the midst of it, then the cooking of food must be done separately for Vaišvadeva and for śrāddha. In the case of all, whether sāgnika or anagnika, Vaišvadeva must be performed with the remainder of the food left after use in śrāddha, if the former is performed after the latter, There were sages like Parthinasi1092 that held that Varsvadeva should not be performed with the food cooked for sraddha without first offering the food to the brābmapas invited for śrādda dinner i e, Vaišvadeva must be performed after śrāddha of the same food is to be used

Modern Pārvanaśrāddha 

for the former. The Nirnayasindhu (II. p. 459) states that as most smrtis place the performance of Vaišvadeya after śrāddha and as many writers of commentaries and digests such as Medhātithi and Smartiratnāvali do the same all should perform Vaišvadeva after finishing śrāddha, 

It is now necessary to illustrate how pārvana śrāddha is performed in modern times. Here the greatest variety prevails, The details of the rite vary in the different parts of India. They vary also according as the performer belongs to a particular Veda or a particular recension of the Veda, they vary according to the particular eminent writor that is followed and further additions are made according as the performer is a Vaisnaya or a Saiva. Such differences have to be passed over here, particularly because they are not material. We saw above that the Pārvada-śrāddha was very simple in the days of the Brābmanas and most of the sūtras. There was then do express mention of the worship of Viśvedevāh in Paryana śrāddha, or of the maternal ancestors or of the wives of any ancestors. Gradually these came to be added and by the time of the Yāmava]kyasmrti there was special invocation of the Viśvedevāh But these latter were probably not expressly divided into groups at the time of that work, During the smrti parjod groups of Viśvedevāḥ came to be assigned to different kinds of śrāddhas (vide p 457 note 1018). The Puranas pres cribed several Pauranic mantras for being recited during the śrāddha rite, such as the verse "āgacchantu' (note 984) and the verso 'devatābhyah pitrbhyasca' (p. 458 note 1020). Then there arose the principle of the Pūrvamımāmsā that all rites described in the different sākās and sūtras constitute but one rite, and that one may take over from another śākkā or sūtra details described therein, which are not opposed to one's own sākha or sūtra (vide pp 453-55 notes 1011-1013). This principle tended to make the śrāddha rites all inclusive and the whole procedure became swollen to an enormous extent. How even the slightest variation causes difference in the details may be allustrated by an example, In Mitbilā villages even among poor men eleven brāhmadas are invited for pārvada-śrāddha, but it is often difficult to secure a very learned man (who is called pātra or mahāpārra) to officiate, In such a case where a mahāpātra or & pātra brahmapa is not available the śrāddha is called apātraka-pārvadašrāddha (for which really there is no sastric authority) and is distinguished from the sapātraka pārvana grāddha in several matters, two of which in the case of the

Vājasaneyins may be stated here. Though the Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana, which is of special authority among Vājagansyias, declares (at the end of kandika III) that the brāhmanas are to be dismissed at the end of the śrāddha with the verse 'Vajo vāje' (Vaj. S 9.18) and the performer should circumambulato the brābmanas with the mantra 'ā mā vājasya' (Vaj S. 9. 19), it is not the practice among the sistas in Mithilā according to the editor of the Srāddharatna to observe these directions in what is called 'apātraka-pārvana-śrāddha' in these days. In Rudradhara's Śrāddhaviveka (pp. 138-146) the "apātraka pārvana-śrāddha-prayoga' is set out at length. 

In medieval and modern times in the different provinces of India different manuals are followed by the followers of the several Vedas. For example, in Bengal the Sāmavedins, Yajurvedins and Rgvedins follow the procedure of pārvada śrāddha laid down in the manuals (or paddhatıs) of Bhavadeya, Pasupati and Kalesi respectively and there are many persons who follow the rules laid down by Raghunandana in his Śrāddhatattva and Yajurvediśrāddha-tattya. In Mithilā, Śridatta wrote his Pitrbhakti for Yazuryedins and the Sraddha kalpa for Sāmayedins and the Srāddha-ratna of Mahānabo pādhyāya Laksmīpati (between 1500 to 1640 A, D ) which is printed at Darbhanga and claims to be the traditional manna) for Maithilas (Maithila-sāmpradāyika-śrāddhapaddhati) in several places says that it follows the Sugatisopāpa of Prati hastaka for Chandogas and also for Vājasaneyins. In tho Madras State Vaisnava brāhmanas follow special troatises on Pūrva and Apara kriyās of Vaidika-Sārvablauma or Harila Venkatācārya or Tolappar and Smārta brābmanas follow tho Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha, which does not much diffor in major matters from the works of Vaidikasāryabhauma, Often the only differences are in the sapkalpa and at the ond It is impossible to exbibit in this work the contents of all those mazuals and to compare and contrast them.

The performer wears white garments (lower and upper) and sits on a seat of kušas or of wool or deer skin and then sips water twice and wears a paurti a on the finger next to the small finger with Rg, IX, 831. He ties his top knot on the head and sacred thread with kusas, and ties three kuša blades with tilas on the left of the dhotz worn by him.

Then after repeating the rell-known verse ‘apavitrah pavitzo vā: 1097 (whoever, whether pure or impure or being in any state whatever, remembers the pame of Visnu becomes purs externally as well as internally ), he requests 'May everything such as the place and the materials be rendered pure'. The brāhmadas reply 'let it be 80.' Then placing some coin on the ground, the performer having in his hand sesamum grains, water and kūšas goes round (pradaksinā) the brāhmaṇas thrice, and repeats three verses (in classical sanskrit) in praise of the dust of the feet of brāhmapas and a Vedic passage from Tai Ă. II, 15 1098 All the devatās reside in a brāhmada who knows the Veda; therefore every day one should perform obeisance to brāhmapas knowing the Yeda. He should not utter anything derogatory or evil (either true or false) about them. (By doing so) he pleases all these devatās. After making obeisance (to the brāhmanas) twice he should be prācīnāviti, repeat the verse 'akrodhanaih' (note 913 p. 407 above) and request the brāhmadas 'way you be pleased to say that I have complete adhihira to perform the sāmvatsarikaśraddha of my pitrs this day.' The brālmanas shou}d reply 'let there be this adlıkāra for the performance of sraddha.' Then being upavitzn the performer requests 'may you declare that this time is the proper time and that the food cooked is fit for being offered' The brāhmanas reply 'let it be go.' Then he asks the permission to give invitation to the brāhmapas. They give it. Then he touches the right kneo of one brāhmana and says "you should find time to accept the invitation to act as representing the Viśve-deyas named Purűraya and Ardrava in this pratisāmvatsarika sraddha of my pitrs'. The brahmana replies 'yes, be it so.' Then tha performer addresses the second Vaišvadevika brābmapa in the

The brāhmada should reply 'so be it,' He should request 'you should repair to my house.' The brāhmana replies 'I shall do so' Then he should make mandalas 1099 for the daiva and pitrya brāhmapas. Then savyam. The performer should offer seat, sandalwood paste, flowers and say 'may all the items (upacāras) of showing honour be complete by means of yava grains.' Then apasavyam.

He should 'wash the feet of (the darva ) brāhmana 'or brāhmanas with the mantra 'san no deyir' (Rg & 9.4, vide n. 968 ). Then he wears the thread in the apasavya way and offers welcome to the pitrya brāhmana or brahmanas representing the three male ancestors 1100 and offers to give pādya to them and they respond witk the words 'susvāgatam' and 'supādyam'. He also employs the verse ' gan no devir' as in the case of daiva brābmanas, 

Then the performer casts away the pavitra worn so far, washes his hands and feet, performs ācamana and wears two pavitras. Then savýam. ' He says 'welcome to all.' They respond with 'susvāgatam'. Then holding the right hand (except the thumb) of the daiva brāhmanas he says "Ye gods, occupy seats '; they respond by saying 'susamāsmahe' (we hayo well occupied them). Then apasavyam. He addresses similar words to pitrya brāhmanas who respond in a similar way. Then savyam. He seeks permission in the words 'I

History of Dharmatāstra ! [Val. shall perform the Pratisāmvatsarika sraddha of my pitrs that has been begun. The brāhmadas say 'do so. Then the perso *gam no devir' (Rg. X, 9.4) is repeated and also the words *thou art yava, separate from us those who hato us and who are our enemies'. Then apasavyam. The following texts are repeated viz. Rg. X. 9.4. Rg. X. 15.1 and with the maptra The aguras, raksasas, the pišācas, that dwell along the earth are struck down; may they go from this place elsewhere whorever their mind may be fixed', he scatters sesamum grains everywhere and repeats the mantra, Rg. .. 87.1 There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras and twelve Adityas. Let there be protection given by Viapu at the door where sraddha is being performed and may this spot be Gay. The brahmadas reply "Let it be a good spot,' Then savyam. He sprinkles drops of water with darbhas over the food that is cooked for the sraddha dinner with the maptras viz. Rg. IX, 58, 1, IX, 67, 26-28 and with the three Vyahrtis and the Gayatri. Then he requests 'May there be purity of the cooking' and 'miay the sprinkling of the cooked food be accord ing to the rules prescribed,' to which the response is so be it.' Then the verse fagacobantu mahābhāgāh' (vide note 984) is recited and the brābmanas reply "we are carefu) (or atten tive).' Then apasavyam. He announces 'contemplating upon this spot whero sraddha is being performed as Gayā and con centrating the mind on Gadādhara (Vispu) and the pitrs in the form of Vasus and the like, the grāddha (rite) proceeds'. The brāhmabas say 'do proceed.' Then savjam. He gives water on the hand of the darva brahmanas, places on the right side of the seat occupied by them two darbhas together with yavas with his upturned right hand held by the left hand and says with the Vyābrtis (Bhūr, bhuyah, syah) 'this is the seat for the brāhmada representing the Viśys devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava', The brahmapa replies 'byāganam'. This is done also for the second daiva brāhmasa, He then says 'Please sit down here, though art Dharma' and seizing the brāhmeda's hand (ex cept the thumb) he says 'accept the invitation for being daiva brālmana in the Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha.' The rosponse is *so be it.' Then reaching the arghya water, he sprinkles the ground in front of the (daiva) brābmanas with water, spreads two darbhas (in front of each darva brahmana) with their tips towards the east, placas down two vessels with their tops turned downwards, sprinkles water over them with the Gāyatri mantra, raises the vessels up (i. e, turns their tops upwards), again sprinkles water over them and places over them (the two

vessels) two kūrcas 1101 with the tips turned to the east, pours into them water and invokes the water once with the mantra, *san no deyir '(Rg. X. 9. 4). Then he puts yava grains into the two arghya yessels for daiva brābmanas with the mantra 'Yavosi dhānyarāja vā' (note 985 ) and also sandalwood paste, florüers, basil leaf and performs obeisance. He says 'May all the upacaras be completed by means of yavas; the two arghya Tessels for daiva brābmanas are fully ready'. The response is * sogampanne'. He says 'syābā, these are arghya wators'. The response is 'let there be arguya waters'. Placing his left hand in which he holds kušas and yaya grains on the right knee of the daiva brāhmana and holding in his (right) band yava grains he says 'I shall inpoke the Viśye deyes called Purúrara and Ardraya to be present in you' They respond 'do invoke', He invokes the Visse-devas with the mantra viśve devāsa' (Rg II. 47. 13) separately repeated as regards each daiva brāhmana. He says, 'I invoke the Višye devas with the mantra 

višye devāh śroutemām' (Rg. VI. 52. 13 ). Having invoked Vibye devas he casts the remaining yaya grains on the ground near the feet of the daiya brāhmadas. Then he gives water to then (daiva brāhmanas) and he puts in their bands the darbhag placed over the ar ghya vessels; he says 'O Vißve devas called -Purūrava and Ārdrava! this is arghya water for you; svābā, adoration'. They respond 'let there be arghya', Repeating the mantra 'yā divyā āpah' (vide Āśy. Gr. IV.7.13 above in n. 966) he says 'this arghya has been offered, it is no longer mine.' They respond let it be so offered'. The same process is followed as to the second daiva brāhmana. Then he offers fragrant 1102 -substances (sandalwood paste etc.), flowers, basil leaves, incense, lamp, and cash according to his ability as substitute for garment, gopicandang for unguent, sacred chord and two kusa blades for pavitra with the words 'O Viśye deyāh, called Pururaya and Ārdrava! these are fragrant substances for you according

1102. Each of the thiogs is offered with the same formula and as to each there is a response from the brāhmanas with 'su' prefixed to each article affered. It would be like this 'पुलवाद्भवसंज्ञका विश्वेदेवाः यथा भागश: अमी यो गन्धा स्वाहा नमः। सुगन्धाः। पुरू..विश्वेदेवा यधा भागश एष वो दीपः स्वाहा नमः tatge i god so on.

to your portions ; svāhā, adoration'. When offering a garment or cash therefor he recites 'yuyā suyāsaḥ' (Rg. III. 8.4). Then he says " these items viz, gandha, leaves, flowers, incense, lamp ending with covering (garmont) be all of them completa, Let there be good worship in the rite of worship; May that which is wanting or is excessive be according to prescribed rules'. The brāhmanas respond 'astu vidhivat' and the per former recites the verge "I do obeisance to Acyuta by romem bering whom or by uttering whose name whatever is wanting in tapas (observances) or sacrifices becomes at once perfeot', 

Then he says to the pitrya brāhmapas 'with your permis sion I shall offer worship to the pitrs'. They reply 'do offer,' Then apasavyam. After bending his right knee, the performer says 'Bhūr bhuyah syah to Brahman, this is the seat for my father, grandfather and great-grandfather, named N, N., whose gotra is so and so and who are identical with Vasu, Rudra and Aditya'. So saying he offers double-folded darbhas with sesamum grains to the pitrya brāhmadas who reply 'syāsanam'. Then follows the same procedure as regards pitrya brāhmanas which has been already set out as to daiva brāhmanas. The only difference is that instead of two darbhas three darbhas are spread on the ground with their tips towards the south, three vessels are placed towards south-east with faces down wards and three double-folded darbhas are placed on each of the three vessels, instead of "yarosi' the mantra is 'tilogi somadevatyah' (vide note 966) and instead of 'svāhā namaha' the words 'gvadhā namah' are employed, and instead of tulasi leaf bhragarāja leaf is employed. In āvahana the per former places his left hand holding kuģag and sesame on the left knee of the pitrya brahmana and the verge repeated is fusantas tva' (Rg. X. 16. 12) as to each pitrya brahmada and he should hopour the pitrs by repeating one mantra 'a yantu nah' (Vaj. S. 19. 58). He offers arghiya 1103 water with the right hand supported by the left to the father and the other two paternal ancestors. He brings together the sandgravas 1104 in the first pitrya Tessel and anoints his face with that water.if he desires a son. The brāhmanas respond 'may you have a son'.

He places the vessel containing saisravas with the top upside down on darbhas to the north of the daiva vessel, with the mantra 'thou art a place for the pitrs.' Then gandha, flowers with tulasi and bhrngarāja leaves, incense, lamp, garment or cash therefor, gopicandana, sacred chord, betelnut, kusas for pavitra are offered to the pitrs and ho repeats the verse 'idam pitrbhyah' (Rg. X. 15. 2). After repeating the verse "yat smrtya' (vide above) there is 'savyam'. The performer says 'with your permission I shall prepare mandalas and place the plates'. The response is 'do so'. On the spot where the plates for daiva brāhmanas are to be placed a four-cornered mandala beginning from the south-west to north-east and made with the right hand towards it and on the spot for the plates for pitrya brālmadas the mandala is circular beginning from north-east to south-west made with the left hand towards it. Then the plates for the diners are to be placed inside those mandalas, Then taking holy asbes (apasavyam) he draws a line round the plates for pitrya brāhmanas with the mantra 'piśanga-bhristin' (Rg. I. 133, 5). Then savyam. Then round the platos of the darva brahmanas he draws lines with the mantras "raksā no' (Rg. IV. 3. 14). and 'brahma ca' (Rg, X. 4. 7) and two more verses (probably Paurānic) which pray that the mark made with ashes may guard all, just as Visou protects the worlds. Just as Vispu renders ineffective the eyes of all men of evil sight, so one should make a mandala with ashes and when this is done there is no blemish in sitting in the same row for dining. Then the purification of the hand (right) of the brāhmanas is done, beginning with the pitrya brāhmana first, Then tbe performer requests 'let me perform agnaukarana with your permission in the hand 1135 of the (pitrya) brāhmana.' The reply is 'do so'. Then apasavyam. Taking some cooked food and anointing it with clarified butter and dividing it into parts, having touched the two parts placed towards the south he says this for Soma accompanied by the Pitrs, this for Agni, the carrier of kavya ' and having spread the left hand under neath the right hand, having cut off portions from the middle and the part to the east according to the rules for avadanas 1196 

1105 If there are three brāhmanas to represent the three pateraal ancestors, then he should say "in the hands of the brābmanas'. The Nirnayasindhu (III. Uttarardha p. 440) says that a widower performs agnaukarana in the hand of the daiva brābmana.

You should take from the foods and vegetables that are cooked and are ready whatever pleases you and should discard what you do not like You should eat at ease'. They respond 'wo partake (of the food)'. He says "I shall recite the hymns called Rāksoghna 1111 as far as I can.' They respond 'repeat'. Then towards the end of the dinner a little boiled rice with ourds (should be served) and nectar-like Ganges water. He says 'overything is perfect Ask for what over you like out of the sacrificial food that is cooked'. They respond te have had enough'. He says "I shall recite the Madhumatı verses (Rg.

He asks what is to be done with the food that remains ?', They reply 'it may be eaten in the company of your friends (and relatives)'. Then savijam. 

Then the performer declares that he would perform in the Prati-samvatsarika-śrāddha pindapradana (the offering of Jumps of rice ) together with water and sesamum grains. They reply do so', 'Let food be given to those who take as their share what remains outside the plates of the brāhmana diners'. The performer says 1112 'May all the (deceased) men and women slaves that were born in the performer's household obtain satis faction by the food given by me on the ground'.

and having held his breath according to his ability he should return to the original position and utter the words 'the Fathers regaled themselves and came like bulls, each to his share and having smelt the remains of the boiled rice from which pindas are made from the left side (to the right) he should cast the pipdas (on the darbhas) and should partake of the boiled rice by taking in as much steam and flavour out of it as he can by smelling it. He should say 'my father! N. N. by name, so and so by gotra, apply unctuous substance'; with these words he should anoint the pindas by means of darbhas with ghee or sesamum oil. And he should apply collyrium to the pindas with the words 'O father! N. N. by name and so and so by gotra apply collyrium'. He should put on the pindas unctuous subst ance, collyrium and garment, 1118 the last being the fringe of & garment or a tuft of wool with the words 'O fathers ! this is the garment for you, do not take up any other ( garment) than this'. Then savyam. He then says 'I shall offer worship to the pindas for the prosperity of my family'. He then offers to the pitrs present in the pindas pūdya, arghya, water for ācamana, bath, gandha, flowers, bhrngarāja leaf, incense, lamp and naivedya of apūpa (cakes) and pāyasa (rice cooked in milk), tāmbūla and daksinā, using the word 'syadhā' after each of them. Then he should worship 1119 them with the mantra *Fathers! obeisance to you for the sake of food, for strength, for susma, for the non-terrible (aghora), for jiva, for rasa; svadha to you, O pitrs, obeisance to you; these are yours, Opitis! these are ours; we are your living (descendants), may ve be alive here'l He then recites the verses 1120 Rg.

Then apasaryan He Bays "I shall offer food scattered near ortaya brāhmadas on the ground covered with darbhas to those who died without the samskar as being performed for them and to those womon of my family who left the family (for bad deeds); this scattered food is presented to those boys and girls that oame out of the womb; it is not mine'. So saying he streys food with water and sesamum seeds and then says after reciting Rs.

So saying he offers near the pitry& brālmapas a ball of rice and water mixed with sesamum grains. 

Then he Tashes his hands and foot, sips water twice and puts on his finger a partra with the mantra 'payıtravantah' (Rg IX. 73.3). He then requests that the wator in the hands of the daiva brāhnianas be auspicious (or beneficial). The brahmanas reply 'may the waters be auspicious.

Then raising the pranīta 1122vessel the performer requests 'May you say that the water and food and the like offer ed in the Pratisāmvatsarikaśrāddha to pitr, pitāmaha and pra pitamaha, so and so by name and gotra, be inexhaustible.' The pitrya brāhmadas reply 'so be it.' Then savyam. The same request is made to the darva brāhmadas and the reply is the same. Then gold is given to the daiva brāhmaṇas and silver to pitrya brahmanas and the performer says 'may the daksinās (fees) given to the brāhmanas that ate the śrāddha dinner protect (me).' They reply 'may they do so." Then he says "I shall request you to utter the word svadhal' -They reply do so.' Then apasavjam. Then he says "May (the brābmapas representing) father, grand father and great-grandfather utter the word syadhā,' They. reply 'let there be svadba.' Then he should place over the pindas sesamum grains and water. Then he says 'May you declare that svadhā be accomplished.' They reply 'may svadhā be accomplished.' Then savyam. Then he says 'may you say that the gods led by Agni be pleased. They reply 'may the Viśvedevāḥ be pleased.' Then apasavyam. Then he Fequests 'May you declare that the pitrs led by the Vasus be pleased'. They reply 'may the pitrs be pleased.' Savyjum. He says 'May you declare that there is accomplishment of the Bankalpa' (made at the beginning of the rite ). They reply * May there be accomplishment of the sankalpa'. He asks * were the vegetables and cooked food liked by the pitrs'. They reply they were most excellent'. Then the performer deck's himself by applying sandal paste to his forehead. After doing obeisance to the pindas he requests for blessings for his family (which are the same as those set out above from the Padma purāna on p 45% above) and one more blessing 'May persons beg of us but may we not beg of any one' (vide n. 998). The brahnanas reply in the same words only employing the words 'you'or your' for 'us' or our'. 

He says 'I shall remove the pindas'. They reply 'do remove'. Then he repeats the verses Tad Vispoh' (Rg. I. 22,20 ), Tad viprāso' (Rg. I 22.21 ) and two more verses and then a Paurabic verse enumerating the seven holy cities of Ayodhyā, Mathurā, Māyā, Kāšī, Kāñci, Avantika and Dvārakā.

[Vol. remove the plates in which the brāhmanas had their dinner.' Then he lays aside the kurca. He then recites the perse "Vāze vāje' (Rg. VII, 38,8). Then savyam. Then he says 

O pitrs, get up together with the devas' and repeats the verses'ā mā vājasya '(Vaj. 8. 9. 19), svādusamsadah' (Rg. VI. 75 9 ), 'brāhmavāsah pitarah' (Rg. VI 75. 10), ihaiva stam' (Rg. X. 85. 42). Then he recites 'may the grand fathers being pleased grant to men ( their descendants) Jong life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, moksa, happiness and kingdom' (Yā). 1. 270, but reads 'Frayaochantu' for 'prayac olianti'). Then he prays "May these blessings turn out to be true, may my family prosper, may this Pratisā.nyatsarika śrāddha have the same fruits as that of a srāddha performed at Gayāl May the pitra secure inexhaustible gratification,' Then he proceeds Today my birth has had its reward by bowing to your feet &c.' (vide n. 999 for the two verses repeated here). The brāhmanas reply we forget the trouble and excuse you.' Then be says 'Today this tithe is like a day sacred to the sun, the brālmanas invited are like Vyāsa, Vasistha and Vāmadova; may you declare that whatever is lacking as regards seats, dinner, mantras, procedure, materials and fees in this prati samvatsarika sraddha of my pitrs performed by me today bem come all perfect at the words of brāhmanas'. They reply "May all be perfect'. Then he recites the two verses "Vasist hāsah pitryad' and 'devān vasistho' (Rg X 66. 14-15) and then at the end he repeats the verse containing a salutation (the word 'namah') viz "zdam pitrbhyo namo astvadya' (Rg. X. 15. 2). Therefore at the end (of a śrāddha rite) one does obeisance to the pitrs (in the words 'namo val pitaro &c '). Therefore they say "should one repeat the pitryā verses with ahāya mantra specially recited with each verse or without ropeating the āhāva mantra separately with each verso, for it is better not to finish Pitryajña quiokly. He who separately recites the ahāva with each verse makes the pittyajsia that 19 imperfect, complete and therefore one must recite specially employing the āhāva with each verse, "1123 The conclusion is

one should repeat each verse with āhāva separately uttered. The performer should follow the brahmanas up to the boundary of the village). He says 'whatever blemish there may be in japa, tapas or śrāddha ritem may all that become free from blemish by the favour of brāhmanas. I do adora tion to that Acyuta (Visnu) by remembering whom &c. 0 best of brāhmadasl may this śrāddha, even if devoid of mantras, or of some rite or of faith, become perfect by your favour. Then he concludes May Janārdana Vasudeva who assumes the forms of father, grand-father and great-grand father be pleased by this sacrifice, viz. the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of the pitrs This is a sacrifice to the manes. Tat sat. May it be dedicated to Brahma,' Then he repeats the verse * Vasat te (Rg. VII, 99 7) and then says 'adoration to Visnu (Visdave namaḥ) thrice and sips water twice. The fruit of offering pizdas is stated by Brhaspati and Vrddha-Parāgara as follows: If the pitrs are in the wor]d of gods they are grati fied by the food offered in fire, if they are in the world of pitrs they are gratified by the dinner to brāhmanas and if in hell they are gratified by the balls offered on the ground.1123a

(Continued froin tite last page) verse' devānim patnīt' (Rg V. 46 6 ) or the rk verse referring to Rākā should be recited first in the आनिमारुतशस्त्र in तृतीयसवन. The conclusion reached is that the verse referring to ye its should be recited first by the 

. In the same context a question is raised whether the Yami verse (Rg X 14 4 'Imam yama prastaram') or the Pitryā verses (Rg. X 15 1-3) should be recited first. The conclusion is that the verse should be first recited, then the Kavya verse (Rg X. 14, 3 "Mātali kavyair') and then the pitrya verses, out of which Rg X. 15, 2 ( TUTXUT FTAT FU) is recited last in which the word नम. occurs, आहाव means the mantra शॉरसावोरम्. The figure 3 is a sign of the Et accept. The sign of a shows deliberation NIE We have to understand awach as the subject Then comes the question whether the 31TETT should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitrgā verses or not The conclusion is that the ITETE should be recited at the begigning of each of the three pitryā verses Apparently it is rather difficolt to say why this passage of the datateor should occur in tbis sreta The only reason appears to be that the dot. passage has something to say about fogs and hence as this is a spalat for rugs it ts introduced here

A, passage occur therein, but the verses in praise of the dust of brābmana's feet do occur. Most of the mantras both Vedic and Paurānio are the same. The blessings (ašir Yādas) in the Madras manual are more elaborate and include even the performer's cattle in the blessing of health and long life. In the Madras manual several mantras are set out as

The procedure for Yajurveding of the Madhyandina Sākba in Bengal as set out by Raghunandana in his Yajurvedi-sti ddhatattva is entirely based on the 2nd and 3rd kapdikās of the Sraddha-sutra of Katyayana. The Pārpanašraddhā-prayoga in Halāyudha's Brāhmanasaryasya closely follors Kātyāyana and I am assured by a careful student of Dharmasastra that the pro cedure of pārvanašrāddha followed by Madhyardinas at Bhat para in Western Bengal is in strict conformity with the proce dure laid down by Raglunandana, The Sraddhasütra of Kātyāyana is translated here with some explanations and additions made by Halāyudha and Raghunandana and the whole text, being not very extensive, is giren in the note below 1124

"The parvana-sraddha is preceded by the rite for Visve devas. The procedure follows that of Pindapitryajña 1124a. In the rites for the pitrs double-folded darbhas are to be used (while in Vaišvadevika rite straight darbbas are used). Whenever any thing is to be gifted, the performer (in all daiva as well as pitrya rites ) wears a pavitra and makes the gift sitting. (When questions are to be asked) the performer puts the question to the most eminent in the row of diners (to the best daiva brāhmana in daive rites and to the best pitrya brāhmana in pitrya rites) or he may put the question to all (and the reply is given by one or by all) Spreading darbhas on the seats (he makes the brāhmapas occupy them), he puts the question 'shall I invoke the Visvedevas (to the daiva brahmana)'. Being permitted (by the daiva brahmanas) in the words 'do invoke', he javokes the Vośredevas with the mantra 1125 'Viśre devāsa agata' (Vaj. S. 7.34 'Ye All Gods, come, listen to this my call and sit down on this darbha grass '). Then he scatters yavas (in front of the brahmanas), mutters a mantra 'Visvedevah srunutemam' (Vaj. S. 33. 53, 'Ye All Gods, hear this call of mine'). After this gapa he asks (the pitrya brāhmanas) 'I shall invoke the pitrs'. When permitted (by the pitrya brāh manas) in the words 'do invoke', he invokes them with the mantra 'usantas tva.' (Vaj. S. 19. 70, 'O Agni! we longing for our fathers place you down' &c.). Then he scatters (sesamum

He offers on the hands of each of the brāhmanas (first daiva and then pitrya) that wear a payitra water in a vessel made of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or precious stone or in whatever vessels may be available or in vessels made of bunches of leaves with the mantra 'yā divyā 1127 āpah &c.'. The water is offered in the words 'O father' N, N. by name, this is arghya for you' (and then to other ancestors ). Having mixed together in the first vessel (meant for the father) the drops of water remaining in the other vessels 1128 for other ancestors, he puts down on the ground the first vesse) face downwards with the words thou art a place for the pitrs', Then (at this stage) gandha 1129 (sandalwood paste ), flowers, incense, lamp and garment are offered ( to the brābmanas repre senting the ancestors). 

Having taken out in another vessel some food from out of the food already cooked for srāddha and having anointed it with ghee he (the performer) asks "I shall perform agnan Tarana'. Being permitted by the brāhmapas in the words do so', he offers into (grhya) fire oblations 1130 as in Ploda

The Sraddhastra of Katyāyana pitryajña, having served (into all the plates for all the brāh manas invited) the food that remains after being offered in fire, he touches with his hands (above and below each plate) and repeats the mantra "The earth is thy yessel &c.' (notes 99%, 1108a). (He keeps some food aside for making pindas later on), Then (having served the food in the plates) he plunges the thumb of the brahmanas in the food with a rk (Rg. I. 22, 17, 'idam Vignur vicakrame') addressed to Vispu or with a Yajus so addressed ("Visno kavyamidam raksasya'). Then he scat tors about (yavas before daiva brābmabas silently and) sesa mum grains with the mantra 'apahatā asurā raksansi vedi sadah' (Vāj. S. 2. 29). Then he should serve hot food very much liked (by diners or by the departed) or he may serve such food as he can afford. While the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating (the dinner) he should perform japa of the follow ing 1131, viz, the sacred Gayatri once or thrice preceded by om and the vyāhrtis, the verses called Rāksoghni (note 1111 ), mantras addressed to the pitrs (Rg. X. 15, 1-23 beginning with Sudiratām-avara ut parāsah)', Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90. 1-16), Apratiratha hymn (Rg. X. 103. 1–13 ) beginning with 'aśuh śiśānah') and other holy texts. Then finding that the brāh mapas are satiated with food, he should scatter some food in front of the dining brahmanas, he sbould give to each brāb mana water once (for apošana at the end of dinner). Then he should mutter as before the Gāyatri, the (three) Madhumati verses (Rg. I. 90 6-8) and the word 'madhu' (thrice). Then he asks are you satiated'. Being permitted by them in the words 'we are satiated', he makes them give their consent as to the rest of the food, collects together all food in one vessel (in order to make pindas from it); he offers (two sets of three pindas, three for paternal ancestors and three for maternal ancestors) on darbhas near the spot where 1132 the brāhmanas dined and left uneaten food in plates and pours water over the pindas for ablution 1133 Some authors say that pindas are to

Then he prays for the following blessings. He prays 'may the pitrs be not terrible (i. e, be kind) to us'. The brāhinanas reply 'may they be so'He prays 'May our family prosper'. They reply 

may it be so'. He prays ‘May donors increase in our family'. They reply 'let it ba so'. He prays "May Vedas and our pro geny prosper'. The reply is 'May they do 80°, He says "May faith not depart from me'; they say "May it not depart'. He says 'May we possess many things that we can donate'. They reply .so be it'. After receiving these blessings he spreads kusas called svadhāvācaniya 1134a together with pavitras (on the ground near the pipdas or, on the pindas themselves according to Devayājõika and others); he asks (all the brāli manas or the most eminent one) 'shall I request you to utter the word svadha'. Being permitted by them in the words 'May svadbā be recited' he prays "May there be svadhū to the pitrs, to the grandfathers, to the great-grand-fathers, to the maternal grandfather, maternal great-grandfather and maternal great great-grandfather'. When the brāhmadas reply "May there be svadha' he sprinkles water over the svadhāyācaniya darbhas with the mantra 'ārjam Vahaptir' (Vā; S. II. 34). Then he turns the vessel top upwards (which had been placed with top downwards) and he should give to the brāhmanas daksina according to his ability. He should make the daiva brābmanas repeat May all the gods be pleased'. He should then dismiss the brābnanas with the mantra 'Vaje vāje' (Vaj.

Pārvanaši āddha in Bengal 

500 

It is to be noted that in the Bengal Manual of Pārvana śrāddha based on the Brahmanasarvasva of Halāyudha and also on Raghunandana's Yajurvedi-śrāddhatattva the following details are added after the pindas are placed on the darbhas and before the dismissal of the brāhmadas, He turns towards the north and says 'O pitrs, regale yourselves here and come like bulls each to his portion,' Then he turns round to his former position and says *the pitrs regaled themselves and came like bulls each to his own share.' Then he loosens 1135 the side of his dhoti which has been tucked up and then folds up his hands (i.e, offers six namaskāras) with the mantra 1136 'Namo vah pitaro rasāya' (Vāj. S. II, 32). He smells 1137 the pipdas and gives the middle one to his wife, if she desires a son, with the mantra 'ādhatta' 

(Vāj. S II. 33), 

From considerations of space the procedure of pārvana śrāddha among Hiranyakešins in modern times is passed over here. Moreover, it closely resembles the procedure in Āśv, Gr. get out above, the principal difference being that some of the mantras are different. The 'Samskāraratnamālā of Gopinātha deals with this from p. 985 onwards But one noticeable feature of this last york is that of making hajr-splitting distinctions, On p. 985 it refers to two śrāddhas (other than pinda-pitr yajña) to be performed on amārāsyā, viz, mās-šrāddha and mastha-śrāddha, the first being described by the Dharmasūtra of Hirapyakešin and the second by the Grhyasūtra. Gopinatha further says that māsikaśraddha is the model of the other śrāddhas described in the Gilyasutra and māsjśrāddha is the model of śrāddhas described in the Dharmaśāstras, such as Mahālayaśrāddha or Samvatsarika-śrāddha, that Darśaśraddha itself is māsi-śrāddha (p. 988) and that māsika-śraddha may be performed on each dar sa or on any one darša day in a year and that māsi-śrāddha follows immediately after Pindapitryajña as

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. laid down by Manu (III. 122) and māsikaśrāddha may be per formed after masi-śrāddha. In modern times no one performs māsitrāddha or māsika-śrāddha strictly in accordance with the ancient rules. Srāddha is supposed to be performed by feeding a brāhmana and giving him a daksidā of a fov annas. The Sraddhatatty& (Jiv., part 1 p. 254) provides, after quoting Matsya and Bhavisya, that, if a person is unable to perform a pāryanaśrāddha every month, he should perform one at least thrice a year when the sun is in the zodiacal signs of Kanya, Kumbha and Vrsabha and that if he is unable to perform even thrice then he should perform at least once when the sun is in the sign of Kanyā. 

The two meanings of sapinda given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga have already been explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and pp. 472–477. The Dāyabhāga pro pounded the theory that whoever conferred greater spiritual benefit on the deceased by the performance of śrāddhas and the offering of pindas was entitled to be preferred as an heir to the deceased's wealth. The Mit. said that heirship depended on blood relationship and the nearest in blood to the deceased vas the preferential heir, But even under the Mit, whoever took. the wealth of the deceased was bound to pay his debts (Ya). II. 51) and to offer śrāddha and pipda to him. This subject and the goveral propositions deduced from the texts have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 734-745. 

One thing to be remembered is that in determining the preferential right regard is to be had to the capacity of a per son and the efficacy of the pindas when offered. Aftor a person takes the vealth of the deceased, there is no legal machinery to enforce his duty to offer pindas 1139 It was argued in Nalinaksha v. Rajanı Kanto 350. W, N. 726 that, if an beir does not offer pindas or refuses to offer them to his ancestor, he was not entitled under Hindu Law to succeed to him. This argument was repelled by the judges with the remark that there was no authority for such a proposition and that the right to inheritance is based under the Dayabbāga not on offoring pinda but on the capacity to offer it (p. 729). Vide Gooroo Gobinda Saha v. Anand Lal 5 Beng. I. R. 15 (F. B.) and Digamber r; Olotilal 9 Cal. 563 (F. B.) for the statement that the principle of spiritual benefit is the sole foundation of the theory of in 

1138, Vide H. of Dh. Yol. II. p. 740 and gote 1431, 

IV) The Dayabhāga theory of spirituat benefit 511 heritance propounded in the Dāyabhāga. But in certain later cases such as Akshayachandra v. Hari Das 35 Cal, 721 it was rightly pointed out that spiritual benefit is not always the guiding principle under the Bengal school of law, that the principle of spiritual efficacy as the guiding principJe fails in all classes of female relations such as the wife, the daughter and the mother whose rights are really based on special texts and that the reason for inheritance by a re-united coparcener was not spiritual benefit but was based on a quasi contract and affection. 

The question about how śrāddha was to be performed if one or more of the three paternal ancestors were alive engaged the thoughts of writers from very ancient times. The Āśy, 1139 Śr. S (IL 6. 16-23) first sets out the views of Gāpagāri, Taulvali and Gautama and then refutes them, Gā pagāri held that out of the three paternal ancestors pindas should be offered to those that were dead and those that were alive should be honoured ja person, since the śrāddha rite is meant for pleasing the ancestors; Taulvali opined that pindas should be offered to all the three ancestors, whether living or dead, since in the rite of śrāddha they are only a secondary matter (a detail). Gautama thought that pindas should be offered to dead ancestors, upto three from the father if the latter was living, from the grand father if he was alive and from the great-grandfather if all the three be living. Āśv, replies; one cannot offer pindas to three ancestors 1140 beyond the father, grand-father or great grandfather, since one has no adhikara to do so; one cannot offer pipdas to an ancestor after whom there is an ancestor (within three degrees) living. One may offer homa into fire to those that are alive, (If all three ancestors are alive) all the three pindas must be cast into fire or he may not begin the rite at all. The Katyāyana śr. 1142 sūtra provides

1140 One can offer pindas only to three ancestors beginning with the father according to Vedic passages quoted in notes 958, 9602 above and Manu IX 186. So there is no ancient authority to offer pinda to 4th or 5th or 6tb ascendant.

History of Dharmatāstra . (Vol, that pindas are offered only to deceased ancestors; therefore if a person's father be alive or if there is a deceased ancestor bettroen whom and the performer there is an ancestor that is alive, then one whose father is alive can only perform homa (into fira, but no pindadana ) or he should not undertake at all (tho rite of pinda-pitryajāa or pirvanaśrāddha); that Jātākaroys prescribes that Lo pindadana is possible wlion a living ancestor (father) intervenes between the performier and & deceased abcestor, since a sruti text says 'one does not offer pindas to ancestors that are beyond a living ancestor.' Madu (II. 220-222 ) deals with this question as follotys: If the performer's father be alire he should offer pindas to three ancestors begio ning from the paternal grand-father or he may request the father to dinner as he would do to a stranger brābmana and offer pindas to the deceased grand-father and great-grand-father, I the father be dead and the grandfather be alive, he may offer a pinda only to the father and the great-grandfather (i.e only two pindas) or the grand father who is alire may be izrited to dinner as if he rere the stranger brāhmada invited to represent & deceased grand-father or if permitted by the grandfather who is alire he may offer pindas to father, great-grandfather and great great-grandfather. The Vişoudharnasūtra (chap. 75) has several rules of & similar character. Some of the Puranas such as Skanda VT 225,21-25, Agni 117.58-59 deal with this matter, Gobhilasmrti (IT. 93 f) has a long passage on this question, one Terse of which is quoted belos, 1142 Many of the commentaries and digests hold dirergent Tiets on this subject, riz, the Mit. on Yaj. I. 254, Kalpataru (šr, pp 210 ff), ST, K. K. pp. 552-556 and Nirpayasindhu (III, pp. 499-503 ). It is impossible to reconcile all the views, The Kalpataru (on śr. p. 240) states that there are thras a}ternative courses for him whose father is alivo, (1) he should pass over the father that is alive and offer pindas $0 those tree ancostors to whom his father offers pindas; (Manu. LIT, 220, Visņu Dh, S 75,1); (2) he should simply offer hona into fira as stated in Āśr. Šr, S. quoted above, (3) he shonld not engage in the rite of pindapitryajia or pārvapašrāddha at all (Gobhila-sarti IL 93). The Nirnaya sindhu says that there are numerous alternatires mentioned by different writers, that they are forbidden in the Kali age and 1142. . Ragarig F rade it operarii parang ganana

that one viow is that a man whose father is alive cannot engage in a pārvapaśraddha and that the real conclusion is that śrāddha may be offered to those to whom the father (of the performer ) who is living offers pivdas. It is clear that one whose father is living should have nothing to do with pindadāna for deceased ancestors. Manu (in latter half of III. 220) allowed an alternative viz. one should feed one's father at a dinner (and honour him with the details of worship such as gandha, dhūpa, dipa) and offer pindas to the deceased grandfather and great-grandfather. When any one or two out of the three paternal ancestors are alive and śrāddha is permitted to a descendant several alternatives become possible by parnu tation and combination, which are passed over here from considerations of space and utility. But the various views held by different writers as described above show clearly what a firm grip the theory of the supreme benefits to be derived from śrāddhas bad on the minds not only of common people but of learned men, who, in spite of the fact that the father was alive and was there to offer pindas to his three ancestors, allowed even the son (whose father was living) to offer pindas to the same three ancestors, The Visnu Dh. S, extends the procedure about 'Jfyatpitrka' to one's mother's paternal ancestors (changing the mantra where necessary ). 1142. Similar rules apply where the performer's mother is alive (Agnipurāna 117.60 ‘evam mātrādikasyāpı tathā mātāmahādike'). 

It is provided by Gobhilasmrti (IL 157 ) that a śruti injunc tion should be made effective by means of anukalpa (of some substituted procedure) if the primary procedure cannot be carried out 1143 If a person cannot secure several brāhmanas but can secure only one, he should perform Pārvapa-stāddha in which six pindas are to be offered with a single brāhmana, pro vided he is pankti-pāvana 1144 (sanctifier of a row of diners) and in such a case, nariedya should be offered in place of the dinner

History of Dharmasastra to the daiva brāhmanas and the food should be thrown into fire; So says Sankha 14.10. If even a single brahmana cannot be had for a pārvapaśrāddha, then one should prepare with kušas the effigy of brābmapa students (batu) and the performer should himself ask the questions and give the answers required in parvanasraddha.1145 

When one cannot secure a brāhmana nor materials, or when one is on a journey, or on the birth of a son, or when one's wife is in her monthly illness, one may perform āmaśrāddha (śrāddha with uncooked grains). 1146 This is stated by the Skandapurāna VII. 1. 206, 52. Kātyāyana and Sauraparāda 19.32 have similar verses 'a twice-born person should perform āmašrāddha when he is on a journey or is in distress, or if he has no fire for cooking and those who are weak may always perform it.' The Madanaparijata (p. 483) states that one who has the adhıkāra for pārvanaśrāddha can alone offer āmašrāddha. Harita says that when there is an obstacle in performing a śrāddha, āmaśrāddha is prescribed except in the case of māsika and samvatsarika śrāddhas, 2147 Amaśrāddha is always pres cribed for sūdras. It was further provided that the grains offered 

in srāddba should be utilized by the brahmanas for eating the s cooked food for themselves and were to be applied for no other 

purpose (Hemadri, Sr. p. 1527). Vyasa provides 1148 that the quantity of grains should be at least two or three or four tinies as much as the grains required for offering cooked food. Some words employed in the various items such as āvāhana 1149

CHAPTER X 

EKODDISTA AND OTHER SRADDHAS 

Having dealt at great length with Parvanaśrāddba which is the inodel of all śrāddhas it is now time to speak of Ekoddista śrāddha that is a modification of Parvanaśraddha 1150 The word Ekoddista means that in which only one deceased person 1152 ja intended (to be invoked or benefited)'. The Pārvana śrāddha is intended for three paternal ancestors and is thus distinguished from Ekoddista. In San gr. IV. 2Baud. gr. III, 12.6, the Sraddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kandika 4), and Yā). I. 251-252, the points of difference between the two are Clearly set out,1152 In this sraddha only one arghya is offered, there is only one pavitra and only one pinda 18 offered, there is no āvāhana (as there is in Pārvana), no agnau luvana, there are no brālmanas invited to represent the Vißve-devas; the question about being satiated by the dinner is to be asked in the word 'svaditam (did it taste well) and the brāhmanas reply with 'susyaditam') (it had excellent taste) instead of saying 'may it be in exhaustible,' the formula here used 18 'May it approach' (or wait upon the deceased person), when the brāhmapes are sent away at the end of the dinner the word used is 'be satisfied (or delighted) and they reply 'we are delighted.' The Visnu. purāna (UT 13, 23-26) and Mārkandeya (28 8-11) closely follow the Sraddhasūtra and Yāj. According to San gr. (IV. 2. 7), 1153

Manu TIL, 257, Mārkandeya (28. 11), Yāj. I. 256 and others, for one year after the death of a twice-born person till the sapindīkarada śrāddha is performed this is the way in which grāddha is to be performed for the preta every month. The Visnudharmasūtra 21.2 provides that suitable changes (üha) should be made in the mantras employed (e.g instead of 'atra pitaro madayadhyam' the mantra should be 'atra pitarmādayas va' (O father | 1154 regale thyself here ). In Ekoddista such a formula as 'ye ca tvām-anu' (those that come after thee) can not be employed and the word 'pitr' is not to be employed (till gapindikarana is performed), but the word 'preta' (Aparārka P. 525 quoting Saunaka-grhyaparisista) 1155 

As seen above (p 262, note 591a) Ekoddista śrāddhas are of three kinds, nava, navamiśra and purāpa Navašrāddhas are those that are performed till the 10th orlith day after death, navamisras (or miśras) are those that are performed after the 11th day till one year (or six months, according to some) after death. Aparārka quotes a verse from Vyāghra 1156 that Ekoddista-śrāddha is performed on the 11th day, on the 4th day, at the end of each month for a year after death and every year on the day of death and a verse of Kātyāyana that (ekoddista) śrāddha should be performed for one who had kept sacred fires on the 11th day after the day of cremation and that the Dhruva śrāddhas should always be performed on the day of death. Aparārka explains 'Dhruvāni' as meaning those that are performed after three fortnights from death. About the navaśraddha there is again a diveigence of views. One meaning has already been given above on p 262 note 593. The Skandapurāpa VI (Nāgarakhanda) 205. 1-4 and Garudapurāna (pretakhanda 5. 67-69 ) state that navaśrāddhas are nine viz. the three performed where a man died, where the funeral pro cession rested on the way and where the burnt bones were collected and six more performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th days after death.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. Numerous works lay down that there are sixteen śrāddhas which must be performed for a deceased person and that if these are not performed then his spirit is not freed from the condition of being a preta and a pošāca 1157 There is a great deal of diver gence of views about what these sixteep śrāddhas are, some works including sapindįkarapa among the 16, others excluding it therefrom, Gobhilasmrti III 67 enumeratesi15s the 16 as follows: The twelve monthly śrāddhas (performed every month on the ththi of death), the first (i. e. the sraddha on the 11th day), two śrāddhas on (a day prior to the expiry of) every six months from the tithi of death and sapindikarada are the sixteen śrāddhas, The Garudapurāna 1159 refers to three groups of sixteen, one of which enumerates the 16 śrāddbas as those performed on the 12th day (after death), after three fort nights, after six months, after every month and at the end of the year, thile the Padmapurāna 1160 enumerates them as follows: the sixteen sraddhas are those performed on the 4th day after death, at the end of three fortnights, after six months, after a year and twelve śrāddhas performed each month (on the tith of death) The Kalpataru p.25 and Brahmapurana g. by Apararka (p. 523) state that the 16 sraddhas are those performed on 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th days after death and the twelve monthly śrāddhas (on the tithi of death 1161 ).

others say that after performing the 16 śrāddhas according to the procedure for Ekoddista śrāddhas sapindana should be performed. 1162 The Madanapārijāta (p. 615 ), the Nirnaya sindhu (III. p. 599) and others say that in this conflict of views one should follow the usage of one's country, Vedic Sakhā or family. There were two views about the śrāddha on the 11th day. It should be remembered that Yaj. III. 22 jaid down impurity on death for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varpas, One view espoused by Sankha and Paithi. pasi was that in spite of the days of impurity not being over śrāddha must be performed on the 11th day (and for the moment the performer becomes pure for that purpose ). The other view was that of the Matsyapurana and Visnudbarmasūtra 21.1 that the first śrāddha (okoddista ) was to be performed on the expiry of āśauca, 

In the case of ascetics dying it is provided by Ušanas 1163 that by the fact of their taking to the order of sannyāsa (of the ekadandi kind in the Kaliyuga) they have not to undergo the condition of being preta, no Ekoādısta nor Sapindikarana should be performed for them by their son or other rolative but only pārvanaśraddha on the 11th day and every year thereafter, Sātātapa provides 1164 that no Ekoddista, no water, no pinda and no cremation rites should be offered to an ascetia nor mourning should be observed, but pārvada-śrāddha should be performed. Pracetas quoted by Mit, on Yāj 1. 256 states that no ekoddista is to be performed for an ascetic nor sapindi karapa, but only pārvana on the day of death every year in Bhadrapada dark half. The Sivapurada (Kailasa-samhita) chapters 22 and 23 deal with the rites to be performed on an ascetic's death on the 11th and 12th days,

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. omitted and so is tho word 'anu' omitted and there is no jam and no recital of mantras in the hearing of the brābmanos, As stated in the Brahmapurana, the śrāddhas performed in the house at the ond of impurity on the 12th day, at the end of a month etc. are called ekoddista. It follows that the rites cailed navagrāddhas offered during the days of impurity are per formed at the place of death or in the cemetery or at a place whoro wntor and pinda are offered (and not in the house ), vido Sm, C. (aśauca p. 176 ). In the navamióra śraddha mantrag aro employed according to some. In former times and now also all tho 16 śróddhas aro performed on the 11th day. Hardly any one waits for ono year to perform Sapipdikarada. In former times it was laid down (e. g. by the Mit ) that in times of difficulty, Sapindikarana should be performed even before a yoar elapses after performing the sixteen śrāddhas. But now this cxcoption has become the rule. 

Sapindīkarana or Sapindana is the reception of a deceased person into the community of pitrs to wbom pindas are offered. Soreral times were prescribed by apoient works for this. A.co to tho Kausitaki gr. IV. 2 this śrāddha could be performed after tlo doath of the deceased at the end of a year or at the opd of throo fortnights or on the happening of a lucky opent (like the birth of a son or a marriage), The Bhāradvāja1165 gr (III 17) allowed it at the end of a year (after death) or in the 11th or 6th or 4th month or on the 12th day. The Baud. Pitroedhasūtra II 1%.1 mentions five times for sapibdikarapa viz one year, 11th, 6th or 4th month or 12th day. The Garudapurāna (Pretakhanda 6 53-54) states the time of Sapindīkarana to be one year, six months, three fortnights, the 12th day or on a lucky occasion, The Vispupurada (DL, 13. 26£) makes similar provisions about sapindikarana (which is an ekoddista śrāddha). Apararka (p. 540) after a long discussion holds that there are three times for a performer who is an āhtāgni viz 12th day, some day between the end of aśauca' and the first amāvāsyā (after death) or the first apāvāsyā after asauca ends and prescribes four times for one who has not kept sacred fires, viz & year, six months, three fortnights or when a lucky event occurs.

commended (for the sapindana śrāddha) because family usages are innumerable, because man's life is short and because the body is evanescent. The Visou Dh S. (21.20) provides that for sūdras 12th day after death is the only day for Sapindī. karada (but without Vedio mantras). Gobhila laid down that after Sapindīkarapa was performed, there was to be no per formance of śrāddhas every month, but Gautama (or Saunaka, according to Aparārke p 543) held the view that they may be performed according to the procedure of ekoddista śrāddbas, Bhattoji says 1166 that when sapipdikarana is performed before the end of the year, then all the sixteen śrāddhas must be per formed before Sapiodikarana, yet the monthly śrāddhas should again be performed at their proper times for one year. Yaj. I. 255 and Vispu Dh. S. 21. 23 prescribe that even if Sapibdi. karana is performed for a deceased person within less than a year from death still for one year food and a jar of water should be given to a brābmapa for the whole year (for the benefit of the deceased). Ušanas provides that even if the heirs of a deceased person are divided in wealth, still the naraśrāddhas, the sixteen śrāddhas, and sapindīkarapa must be performed by one alone 1167 (e. g. the eldest son), but Pracetas provides that when a year has (elapsed ) śrāddha may be performed separately by each heir 1168, 

The procedure of Sapindana or Sapipdikarana is des cribed in numerous works such as the San, gr. V. 9, Kausi taki gr.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. Pitrmedhasūtra II, 12.12, in this sraddha there is invitation to the brāhmanas the previous day, there is agnaukarana, there is the recital of Vedic texts when the brāhmanas are engaged in eating, Vaidvadeva brāhmanas are honoured, the Višvedayas are Kama and Kāla (vide n. 1018), there is the presentation of incense and lamp, there ja svadla and also namaslāra. Four vessels for arghya should be got ready and filled with sandal wood paste, water and sesamum grains, one being for the deceased (the meta) and three for his paterna) ancestors, two daiva brāhmanas should be invited, one to represent the preta and three to represent the three paternal ancestors of the prela; if a man is unable to invite so many brahmanas, be should invite three, one for Viśvedevas, one for the pieta and one for the three paternal ancestors. He should request 'I shall unite the vessel for the preta with the vessels for his thres paternal ancestors' When permitted in the words do unite', he should cast the kušas in the vessel for the preta into the vessels for his three paternal ancestors, should keep a little water mixed with kuśas in the vessel for the preta and distribute the rest of the water froin the preta vessel into the three vessels for his ancestors with the two mantras 11*** 'ye samāna' (Vā), S. 19, 45-46) Arglya is offered to the brahmana representing the preta with the water that remains in the preta vesse), arghya is offered to the three patria brahmanas from the three pitrya Vessels. Four pindas should be prepared, one for the prela and three for his ancestors and then the performer requests *I shall unite the protapinda with the pindas for the three ancestor's of his'; when permitted in the words 'do unite ', tha performer divides the pretapinda into three parts and puts each third into each of the three pindas with the same tio mantras (Vāy. S 19. 45-46). The Garudapurana (1, 220,6 ) strikes a discordant note in that it states that the pretapında is to be divided in two parts, each of which is to be placed inside tho pindas for pitamala and prapitāpaha only.

Šapindikarana 

523 

Sapiodikarana partakes of the character of both ekoddista and pārvana, the first applying to the preta and the 2nd to the threa ancestors of the preta, so that in it two kinds of śrāddhas are combined. When the sapindikarana rite is completed by the giving of daksinā to the brahmanas, then the preta ceases to be so and himself becomes a pitr. The status of being a preta involves the experiencing of great torments due to hunger and thirst and becoming a pity means being brought in contact with the traddha devatas called Vasu, Rudra and Aditya.1170 The word preta has two meanings, (1) a person who is dead and (2) one who being dead has not the sapindikarana performed for him The result of sapindana is that the 1171 great-grandfather of the deceased whose sapindana is performed drops out from the list of pitrs, entitled to pipda and becomes one called "lepablāk' (entitled to only wipings of the hand) and the former preta becomes one of the pitrs and entitled to participate in the pindag offered at a pārvavaśraddha thereafter. As stated in the Garudapurāna I 220, 2 the sapindikarana-śrāddha is to be perforined like the pāryana in the afternoon. 

It may be noted that in some works the mantras recited at the time of pouring the water from the preta vessel into the pitr Vessels are different For example, the Visnu Dh. S. 21. 14 sayg1172 the mantras are 'Samsrjatu tvā prthivi' (May, the earth unite thee) and 'samāni va ākutiḥ' (Rg. X. 191. 4), while the

Grhya-parisista 1173 of Ašv, employs the three Madhumati yergas (Rg. I 90,6-8) and the three fine verses at the end of the Rigveda beginning with 'sangacchadhvam' (Rg. X 191. 2-4, 'May you unita' &o.). . 

Yaj. (1 254) and Markandeya (28. 17-18) provide that Ekoddista and Sapindīkatana Graddhas are performed for women also (but, not pārvana nor abhyudayika), About the Sapindikarana of the mother there are somewhat conflicting dicta. If a woman dies sonless and her husband is alive, her sapindana is effected with her mother-in-law (Gobhilasmrti II, 102). If a woman dies leaving no son and the husband also 18 dead, then no sapindana can be performed for her. If she died either on the funeral pyre of her husband 1194 or afterwards (as a Satz ) then her son should perform her sapindana with her husband (1, e. the son's father) and there is no separate sapin dana for her. If she was married in the asura form or she was made a putrikā, then the son should perform his mother's sapin dana with his maternal grandfather; while & son born of a woman married in the Brahma and three other proper forms may perform her sapindana with her husband or the paternal grandmother or the maternal grandfather. In the case of these three alternatives if there is a certain family usage that should be followed; otherwise there is an option. If a woman has a step-son, the latter should perform her sapindana with his father, as Manu IX. 183 ( Vas, 17. 11) indicates. Vide the Mit on Yāj I. 253-254 and Sra. C. (on zsauca p 169) for discus sion of these points and for various alternatives 1175 

The Nirnayasindhu (III, p. 388) says that there is no sapindana for one whose upanayana was not performed when

he died, but if he was more than five years old then the 16 śrāddhas are performed for him (though not sapindana) and pinda is offered on bare ground. It may be noted that no auspicious rite like marriage in which abhyudayika śrāddha is necessary can be performed until the sapindana of a deceased person of the family has been effected (except in the case of such absolutely necessary ceremonies as simantonnayana). 

Manu (V. 89-90) prescribes that no water and other rites like sapindīkarapa are offered and performed for those who had left off their faith, who were born of condemned mixed marriages, who entered ascetic orders, who had committed suicide (by hanging, poison &c.), who had embraced heretical doctrines, for women that wilfully seek illicit connection with men, that did harm to their foetus or husband (were guilty of abortion and murder of husband) and that were addicted to drinking sura. Yāj. II. 6 contains similar provisions. It has to be noted that every kind of suicide is not condemned by the ancient smrtis. Vide H, of Dh. vol. III, pp. 939, 958–9 for cases where suicide was not condemned. Except in those cases Yama (g by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 6) provides that in the case of the persons mentioned in Manu and Yāj, there is to be no āśauca observed, no water oftered, no tears shed, no cremation and no last rites. The Mit. (on Yāj, NI, 6) quotes Vrddha Yājāavalkya and Chāgaleya that in the case of those who are guilty of condemned suicide the procedure of Nārā yapabali should be resorted to after a year and then sraddha may be offered to them. Then the Mit. describes at length the pro cedure of Nārāyanabali. Vide note 838 b p. 370 above for the Skandapurāpa, Nagarakhanda 219, 19-21 on the view that šrāddha may be performed on the 14th of the dark half for per sons who committed suicide or who met a violent death. 

The Abhyudayıka-śrāddha is to be now described. Asv. gr. IV. 7 mentions in one place only four sraddhas viz. Pārvana, Kāmya, Abhyudayika and Ekoddista (note 966 above). Many of tle sutras such as Āsv. gr. I. 5. 13-15, Sat, gr. IV. 4, Gobhija gr. IV, 3. 35-37, Kausitaki gļ, IV, 4, Baud. gr. III. 12. 2-5, the Srāddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kandikā 6 ) briefly describe this srāddha. According to most of these sutras this šrāddha is performed when there is a lucky event such as the birth of a son, or his caula, upanayana or marriage or there is the commencement of a charitable (purta) act (such as the dedication of a well or a tank or a park to the public), Āýv.

{ Vol. gr, and Gobhila gr. are very brief. They say that in this sraddha performed on auspicious ocoasions or on the under taking of meritorious acts an even number of brālimapas is to be fod, that the rite is to be performed from left to right and that yavas barley) are to be used instead of gesamum grains, As this Srāddha is only a modification (Vikrti) of pārvana ( as said by Aparārka . 514) all rules of the latter will be applicable to the former except where special directions are given. The Ašv. gr. parišista II. 19, Smrtyarthasāra (1. 56), Pitrdayita pp. 62-71 give a compact but tolerably full description of this sraddha. 

In this sraddha which is to be performed in the morning (oxcept on the birth of a son when it is to be done at once ) the Vißve-devas are called Satya and Vasu, it is porformed in tho 

• forenoon, the brālimanas to be invited must be oven in number, the darülias are to be straight (and not doublefolded) and are not to bo with their roots; the performer wears his sacred thread in the usual form (and not in the pracinūvita form), all actions are to be done from Loft to right (pradaksinan and not prusavyam); the word svadha is not to be used; yava grains are to bo omployed instead of sesamum grains, he invites then with tho words "find time to attend Nandišrāddha'. The brālimanas say be it so. To says 'May you two come to my houso ); they reply 'wo two shall come'. The performer faces the east or north (but never the south); the mantra about yavas is 'yavosi' (vide note 966 ) 1976 he requests 'I shall invoke the pitrs called Nāndimukha : 1197 When pormitted by the Brāhmapas in the words 'do invoke' le says 'may tho Nandīmukha pitra be ploased'; he offers arghya only once with the words 'O Nāndipukla pitrsthis is the arguya for you'. Sandalwood paste, incense, lamp are to be given twice; the lonia is made on the hand of the brahmana, the two mantras being 'to Agni, the bearor of havijal svālā' and to Soma accompanied by the pitrs) syāhā' While tho

brābmanas are eating the dinner, the Rāksoghna mantras and mantras addressed to Indra and propitiatory mantras may be recited but not the mantras addressed to pitrs (viz. Rg. X, 15. 1-13); when he sees that the brāhmanas aro satiated, he recites the five verses (Rg. IX. 11.1-5) beginning with 'upāsniai gayatā narah' (O men) sing for this soma) instead of the Madhumati verses (viz, Rg. I. 90. 6-8) and at the end he makes the brālmapas hear the mantra 'the pitrs have partaken ( of the food), they have regaled themselves'. The performer should ask 'I shall request the nāndimukha pitrs to utter benedictions' at the stage where (in Pārvapa) aksayyodaka' is asked for, to which the brāhmabas respond with the words 'do request.' The performer employs the word 'sampannam' (was it perfect) in asking about the gratification of the brāhmapas, who reply with the word 'susampangam' (it was quite perfect). On the brālimadas sipping water after their dinner, he covdungs the places where the dinner was taken, strews darbha grass thereon with their tips turned towards the east and offers thereon two pindas for (each of the ancestors) made with the food that remains after the brāhmanas have eaten mixed with curds, jujube fruit and prsadajya 1178 (mixture of curds and clarified. butter). The pindas are offered to the mātrs, to the three paterna) ancestors and the three maternal ancestors (viz. mother's father, mother's paternal grandfather and her paternal great-grandfather). Some do not offer pindas in this šrāddha (as stated by Āśy. gr, parisista II, 19). The Pitrdayitā and Srāddha-tattva (Jiv. p. 297) say that no mātršrāddha is to be performed in Abhyudayıkaśrāddha by the followers of the Sāmaveda. It is possible that the sraddha for the mother, paternal grandażother and paternal great-grandmother was inspired by the Anvastakya śrāddha, as the sātras from ĀŠv. gr. quoted below will indicate 11784 

The words Nandißrāddha and Viddhisraddha are synony mous When Yāj I. 250 says117) that the Nāndimukha pitrs should be worshipped with pindas when there is vrddhi (a lucky or auspicious event), he indicates that Nāndiśrāddba and Vrddhi

[ Vo śrāddha mean the same thing. As noted by the Mit, on Yāj. 1. 250 quoting Sātātapa tbis sraddha is made of three parts, viz. mātr-śrāddha, pitršrāddha and mātāmahašrāddha, "80 On the other hand the Bhavisya-purada I 185. 15 states that there are two šrāddhas in this viz Mātr-śrāddha and Nandimnkha-piti śrāddha. Abhyudayika-šrāddha and Vrddhjšrāddha are treated as synonyms in some works such as the Padmapurāna, 1191 though it may be said that Abhyudayika śrāddha is wider in import than Vrddhiśraddha, since it is also applicable to sraddha performed on the commencement of a purta act. 

The Vispupurāņa III, 13, 2-7, Markandega 28, 4–), Padmaa purana (srsti 9. 194–199), Bhavisyapurāba I 185. 5-13, the Vispudharmottara I 142. 13-18 describe briefly the procedure of Nāndiśrāddha and also the occasions on which it is to be per formed. The occasions specified are 1182: on the marriages of song and daughters, on entering a new house, on naming & child, at the time of Cüdākarma, at Simantonnayana, on the birth of & son, & householder should honour the group of pitrs called Nandi mukha. The Mārkandeya-purāna 28. 6 notes that some desire that this śrāddha should not have Vaišvadeva brāhmanas, but the Padmapurāna srstikhanda 9.195 ) says that in this viddhi śraddha the mothers are to be first honoured, then the fathers, then the mātāmabas and then the Vitre-devas Hemādri (śr. P. 107) quotes two yerses from the Brahmapurāpa to the effect that the father, paternal grandfather and paternal great-grand father are called aérumukha pitrs, while the three paternal ancestors beyond the great-grandfather are called Nāndīmukha pitrs.8183 The Kalpataru (on śrāddha p 270) explains these verses as meaning no more than this that in case the three paternal ancestors of a man are living and there is a lucky orent, then the devatās for Nāndiśrāddha in his case would be the three

(Vol. laid down that in the case of one's parents this šrāddha par takes of the character of pārvana. 11861 The Bhavisya-purada and Skanda state that the Samvatsarika sraddha is the most eminent among srāddhas and that if a son does not perform the yearly graddha of his parents on the day of death he goes to the horrible Hell called Tamisra and then is born as a pig in a town, 1187 In connection with this, if the tithi or month of death or both are not known then Brhaspati, the Skandapurāda, Padma and Bhavisyapurāna lay down certain rules, viz 1188 (1) if the tithz is known but the month is not known, then the šrāddba should be performed on that tithi in the month of Mārgasirsa or Magha; (2) if the month is known but the tithi is not known, then the śrāddha should be performed on the amāvāsyā of the month; (3) if both the tithi and the month are not known, then one should take the tithi and the month when the deceased started from home; (4) if even the day and mouth of starting be not known, then the tithi and month in which a person bears of the death of a relative should be taken, It is to be noted that the month in pitrya rites is lunar and the words 'dina, ahah, võsara' in connection with pitrya rites mean ' tithi' (Aparārka p. 545). There is to pratyabdzka śrāddha in an intercalary month (Skanda VII. 1. 206, 59). 

A few words may now be said about some other śrāddhas. 

A well-known śrāddha is the Mahālayaśrāddha Some of the Purānas deal with this, The Padmapuržoa (Srsti-kbanda) says "In the fifth fortnight (paksa) beginning from the Full Moon day of Āsādha, one should perform a srāddha, whether the Sun is by that time in the zodiacal sign of Kanya (Virgo) or not. The sixteen days when the Sun is in Kanya are equal to the solemn sacrifices which are completed with the gift of the

The Mahālayasrāddha best of daksipās. If it is not possible to perform the śrāddba in the dark half (when the Sun is in Kanyā), one may perform it when the Sun is in Tulā (Balance). When the Sun enters the sign of Scorpion (without a śrāddha being performed), the Fathers go away losing all hope and after pronouncing a terri ble curse (on their descendants) they return to their abode.' 1189 The fifth fortnight from the Full Moon day of Āsādha is the dark half of Bhadrapada. The dark half is the preserve of pitrs. In Bhādrapada the Sun is in the middle of its apparent motion in daksināyana. Therefore the dark half of Bhadrapada is specially chosen as the best period for śrāddha to the pitrs i, e. for the Mahalaya The śrāddha performed in Bhadrapada dark half is called Mahālaya-śrāddha, since that fortnight is the abode (alaya) as it were of the maha ( i. e. festival day ) for 'pitrs, The real idea is that the dark half of Bhādrapada is specially to be welcomed for a śrāddha when the Sun is in Kanya during that fortnight and that even if the Sun is not in Kanya the dark half of Bhadrapada is still a good time for a srāddha to the pitrs. The Skandapurana 1190 also says 'In the fifth fort night from the Full Moon of Āsādha, when the Sun Occupies the sign of Kangā, the pitrs of him who offers a śrāddha on the tithi of the death (of one's father) certainly derive gratification for one year thereafter.' The Kalpataru quotes the Bhavisya purāpa to the effect that if a man has not performed śrāddha in

Mahalaya (i. e, in the dark fortnight of Bhadrapada when the Sun is in the sign of Kapyā) he should offer it on the 15th day (of the dark half of Asvina) on which, it is well-known, lamps are lighted, 1191 The Sraddha-sāra (p. 113) and the Smartimukta phala (on grāddha p. 745) quote Vrddha-manu to the effect that the latter half of Bhadrapada when the Sun is in Kanyā is called Mahālaya and alao Gajacchāyā. Various views are held on the question of the exact day on which the Mahālayasraddha is to be performed, viz, it may be performed on any day from the first tathi of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the amāvāsyā or from the fifth of the dark half to the amavasyā of Bhadrapada or from the 8th or 10th of the dark half to amāvāsya or from the 5th of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the 5th of the next fort night or on any day on which the Sun is in Kadyā or on any day till the Sun enters Scorpion. 119 Prajāpati states that there' are numerous srāddhas described by the Puranas, a]] of them yield rewards but the Mahalaya (śrāddha) is the most eminent among thein, 1193 

The Mahālayaśraddha is to be performed, as stated by the Markandeyapurāpa, in accordance with the procedure of Pārya paśrāddha. 1194 The Smrtyarthasāra states that if it is no$ pos sible to perform all śrāddhas (except sapindīkarapa) according to the detailed procedure of Pārvadašrāddha they should be performed by the procedure called 'Sankalpavidbi', which con sists in performing the details laid down for Pāryada as far as possible except the details of āvahana, arghya, homa and pindadūna. 1195 The Madanepārijāta (pp 609-610) also states that when a man has to perform a 'sankalpa-Sraddha' he deed not go through the details of arghyadūna, vkıra and there is no āyāhana, no agnaukarana and no piudadana even, but he has simply to feed a brāhmada or brāhmadas

In the Mahalayaśrāddha the Viśvedevas are Dhuri and Locana, This śrāddha is performed for the benefit not only of the paternal and maternal ancestors with their wives, but also for other relatives and persons that are dead (together with their wives, sons and husbands if these be dead) viz one's step mother, one's wife, gon, daughter, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, brother, paternal aunt and maternal aunt, sister, paternal uncle's son, son-in-law, sister's son, father-in-law, mother-in law, ācārya, upādhyāya, guru, friend, pupil and any other relative. 1196 Some perform only for the paternal ancestors with their wives and the maternal ancestors with their wives. The day on which the moon is in Bharani naksatra in the dark half of Bhādrapada is called Mahābharani and śrāddha performed on that day is said to be equal to Gayāśrāddha (Matsyapurāna g. by Sr, K, L P 99) The Mahālaya-śrāddha is to be performed on the 12th tithi of Bhadrapada dark half in the case of a sannyāsin and on no other tithi and his yearly śrāddha is to be performed by his son according to pāryapa method as in the case of householders. The dvadasi is sacred to Visou and yatis always repeat the words 'namo Nārāyanaya' and therefore the 12th is the special tithi for the mahālaya śrāddha of yatis, The Mahālayaśrāddha is not to be performed in an intercalary month (malamāsa). 

Two more śrāddhas that are performed even to this day may be mentioned here. One is called “Mātāmabaārāddha' or 'Dauhitra-pratipad-śrāddha'. A daughter's son whose parents are alive can alone perform a sraddha for his maternal grand-father (together with the maternal grand-mother if she also be dead) on the first tithi of the bright half of Asyina 1197, Å daughter's son can perform it even if his maternal grand father has a son or sons living It may be perforined with or without pindadāna (generally without it) and it may be per formed even if the daughter's son has not been invested with the sacred thread, The Srāddhasāra notes that the mātāmaba. śrāddha is based only on the usage of ģistas (p. 24),

the dark half of Bhadrapada. It ceases to be performed when the busband dies after the woman's death, The Nirdayasindbu notices several views about this and says that one should follow the usage of one's country 1198. According to the Mar kandeyapurāna in this śrāddha not only a brāhmana but also a woman whose husband is alive is to be fed and presents of & girdle, & garland and bangles are to be made to her. 

It will have been seen from the translation of Abv. gr., Yaj and the Padmapurana that daksinā, according to one's ability, has to be given in each sraddha towards the end of the rite. The Skandapurana (VI. 218. 13-14) provides that what ever is wanting in mantras or the proper time or in procedure becomes perfect by daksina. Srāddha without daksidā is like rain on an arid place or like dancing in the dark or like singing before a deaf person, that he who desires the permanent gratification of himself and his Manes should not offer & śrāddha without daksidā. The Ramayana shows how on the 12th day after the death of king Dasaratha gifts of jewels, of hundreds of cows, wealth, food in abundance and vehicles, of male and female slaves, of spacious houses were made to the brahmavas, 1199 The Asramayāsikaparva (14 3-4) recounts the valuable gifts to brābmanas in honour of Bhisma, Dropa, Duryodhana and other fallen warriors, adding that persons of all vardas were treated to profuse food and drink The Vayupurana (chapter 80 ) propounds in great detail the rowards of various kinds of gifts made in śrāddhas From considerations of space those descriptions are passed over here and only a brief eulogy of the gift of cooked food is given in the note below. 1200 The Santiparva (chap 42.7)

535 TV1 states that while Yudhisthira performed the after-death cere monies of the fallen heroes he erected sabhās, prapās, water reservoirs and the like intending them for each separately. Devala states. 'when the brāhmanas have sipped water after dinner, daksinā is to be given' and Brhaspati prescribes * Daksipā should be given to all the brābmapas according to the learning of them by means of (gifts of) cows, land, gold, clothes. He should do this in such a way that they feel satisfied, one who is well-off should do this specially. '1201 The Ābvamedhika-parya (6. 2-5) states that Vasudeva offered śrāddha to his sister's son Abhimanyu and donated to sixty thousand brāhmanas, gold, cows, bed-steads, clothes and fed them. A special rule was provided by Brhaspati that the clothes, ornaments, bed-stead and the like, the horse and the like that were used by the father during his lifetime should be presented to the brāhmana invited for śrāddha after honouring him with sandalwood paste and flowers, 1201a The Anušāsana parya (chapt. 96 ) states the origin of the practice of giving an umbrella and sandals on the completion of a grāddha, 

Something must be said about the gift of the bed-stead (sayyā) used by the deceased on the 11th or 12th day after death. The Garudapurāda (Pretakhanda 34, 69–89), Padma (srstikhanda 10. 12), the Matsyapurāna highly eulogise the gift of sayyā to a brāhmapa and his wife. Tho Matsyapurāpa states that on the 2nd day after the end of impurity on death the performer (of śrāddha ) should donate a bed-stead possessing special characteristics; on it the golden image of the deceased should be placed and also fruits and clothes. After honouring a brāhmada couple with many ornaments this should be done; then a bull should be let loose (for the benefit of the deceased) and the gift of a dark brown con should also be made.1202 The Garudapurana (Pretakhanda 34, 73–8%) gives a more elaborate description which appears to be almost identical with the

verges of the Bhavisya quoted by Hemādri. The Bhavisya purāna quoted by Hemādri (and from Hemādri by the Nirnaya sindhu p. 596 ) states the mantra to be recited viz "just as the bed-stead of Krşpa is never devoid of Laksmi, the daughter of the ocean, similarly my bed may not be empty in each birth that I may have to undergo,"1203 Acceptance of the gift of a sayyā was looked down upon in former times and even now it is only the poor brāhmanas ( that are not generally learned) that accept this gift The Padmapurāpa condemns the accept ance of the gift of sayyā in no measured terms. It says 'when a brāhmade accepts the gift of a bed-stead, he should have to undergo the ceremony of upanayana again. In the Veda as well as in the Purāja (the gift of ) a bed-stead is everywhere condemned and all those who accept the gift go to hell.' 1204 

Certain other matters connected with śrāddhas may be briefly touched upon. In very ancient times twelve kinds of sons were recognized out of whom the ksetraja, 1205 the putrika putra and dattaka were most important All these were the Bons of two fathers. The question mooted was: to whom were they to offer pindas? The Madanapārijāta (pp 607-608) quotes a passage from the Hārīta-dharmasūtra 1206 and explains it. Harita says, 'seed does not grow without a field Since it is seen that both are necessary the child born is the child of both. Out of the two (fathers) tha procreator is to be first invoked

A dattala is a soo whom his father or mother gives to another as a son conārming the gift with water (Madu IX, 168). Vide H. of Dh vol. III. pp. 647-650 for detailed explanations about these and other secondary sons.

(and then the kgetrin). He (the son) way offer two pindas to each grade of the ancestors or he may offer a siogle pinda (to the father and ) may repeat the names of both (fathers) as to that single pinda. The son of the son of two fathers ) may repeat two names as to the 2nd pinda (i. e. the pinda for paterpal grand-father); the grand-son (of the son of two fathers ) may do the same as to the third pinda (viz, the pioda for paternal great-grandfather ),' Manu IV, 140 and Gobhila-smrti II. 105 say about the putrikāputra 1207 that he presents the first pioda to his mother (as she was appointed as a son), the 2nd to her father and the third to his father's father. This appears to be one order in which pindas are to be offered by the putrikāputra, while Manu IX, 132 sets out another method since it says that a putrikāputra inherits the entire wealth of his own father if he is sonless and he gives two pindas (i. e. performs two śrāddhas) for his own father and for his maternal grandfather. The Sān, Śr. S. provides 1208 that if there be two fathers, the son should recite the names of both (bījin and ksefrin) with reference to the same pinda. Even Yāj. says "The son procreated according to the rules of niyoga by & sonless man on the wife of another inherits the wealth of both and offers pinda to both. 7209 The Mit, adds that if a person appointed to procreate a son on another's wife has a son, then the son so begotten becomes the son of the ksetrin alone and not of the bijin. As the kshtraja and putrikā putra have beconie obsolete for several centuries the subject has only an academic interest now, But the daltaka is still in · vogue and a few words must be said here about the persons to whom the dattaka offers pindas. The Kalpataru quotes from the Pravarādhyāya a passage on this point which is as

(Vol. follows: 1110 "If these (i.e. those who are bijin ) bave no issue born of their own wives, (the sons begotten by niyoga or given in adoption) should inherit their wealth and offer pindas to them up to three ancestors; if both (the bijin and ksetrig or the giver and taker in adoption) have no other son, then they (sons begotten or adopted ) should offer pinda to both, in one and the same śrāddha they should repeat (the names of) the two ancestors respectively (of the acceptor and that of the bogetter) after having separately intended the same pinda for both up to the third ancestor.' The Baud, Dk. S. 1211 quotes a verse as follows "The son of two fathers shall give the pinda (to his two fathers and pronounce) two names with each pinda; three pindas will thus serve for six persons (apcestors).' It would be seen from the passage quoted above from Hārīta that some authorities allowed two separate pindas for each degree of ancestors when there were two in the same degree. Manu IX. 142 lays down the son given should not take the golra and wealth of bis natural father, the pinda follows the gotra and Wealth; the suadhā (obsequies) of hia who gives his son in adoption) cease of fail (so far as that son is concerned).' This Verse has been so interpreted by some decisions of the High Courts and of the Privy Council as to mean that the son adopted becomes totally severed from the family of bis birth, This subject has been discussed at great length in H. of Dh. vol III pp 690-697 and it 18 established there that the severance of the son given in adoption is only partial, that the gotra of the patitra) family persists even after adoption into another family for purposes of marriage and āśauca and that the Nirnayasindhu, 1212 the Dharma-sindbu and the Dattaka. candrikā declare that the son given away in adoption into another family can perform the śrāddha of his natural father,

He must drive away the bull together with the young cows in the north-eastern direction and give & pair of garments, gold and a vessel of bell metal to the hotr (officiating priest).

That 1219 pool at which a bull let loose (in honour of a deceased person by his son or the like) drinks water serves (reaches) the manes, Wherever a bull (let loose) exulting in his strength scratches (cr digs up) the earth, that earth becoming abundant food and water waits upon the manes." 1220 In the Anušāsanaparva the pitrs are represented as saying that by letting loose a dark coloured bull, by offering water mixed with sesame and by lighting lamps in the rains a man becomes free from the debt he oves to the pitrs (chap. 125. 73–74). 

In the Garudapurāpa it is stated that the deceased person for whom a bull is not let loose on the 11th day after death permanently remains a preta, even if hundreds of śrāddhas are offered for him, The same Purāda further provides that if a bull be not available on the 11th day, then the effigy of a bull made of darbhas and flour or clay should be symbolically let loose,1221 In the Bhavisyapurāna the 12th day after death is prescribed for the letting loose of a bull (N.S. III. p. 505), The Nirnayasindhu says that the making of an effigy of a bull with clay, darbhas and flour is without authority. Even at present people let loose a bull but owing to the rise in the prices of bulls this is becoming less frequent, Several medieval digests such as the Pitrdayitā (pů, 84, 94), Sraddhaviveka of Rudradhara (pp. 69-77), Nirnayasindhu (IIL pp. 595-596 ), Suddhiprakasa

pp. 225-230, Antyegtipaddbati of Nārāyapabhatta present a far more elaborate description, but from considerations of space thoy are passed over here. It is provided in these and other digosts that such a bull should not be seized by anyone nor made to draw a vehicle and the cow Or Cows let loose along with him should not be milked nor confined in a cow-pen. A bull is not lot loose for a deceased woman, but a cow may be donated together with its calf without being branded and after being decked with sandal-wood paste,1nzia 

What is the idea underlying the letting loose of a bull after the death of a person? If a conjecture may be hazarded, it appears to have been thought that if a bull were freed from toil ( that is the lot of most bulls) and placed in the midst of pleasant surroundings, that act of the relatives of the deceased may in a vicarious manner conduce to the bappiness of the departed spirit in the other world,

Pr. pp 363-364), the Kalpataru (on śrāddha pp. 277-279), Hemādri (Sr. pp.1704-1717), the Srāddhaprakasa (pp. 361-371) and a few other digests describe the procedure of Jivat-frāddha or Jiva-śrāddba, which a man was allowed to perform for the benefit of his own soul, while he was himself alive. Baudhāyana's being probably the most ancient extant description it is briefly set out bore "A man who desires his own highest happiness should fast on the 13th tithi of the dark half and bring together materials on the same day, which are required in the funeral rites of deceased persons, vix six garments, a golden needle, a goad, a moose made of (cotton ) threads, a ragged garment, a stalk of palasa leaves, a chair of udumbara wood, jars and other materials also On the next day he bathes; after standing in the midst of water he comes out and makes (the brāhmanas) pronounce this is an auspicious day, may there be happiness and prosperity (for you)'; he makes a gift of garments, & ring and daksinā and facing the south eats rice boiled in milk and mixed with ghee. 1221 a.

He kindles the fire according to the general 1222 procedure laid down for homa, spreads round it darbhas, cooks food on the fire and offers from the cooked food four oblations of food into the fire; the first is made after first reciting the Puronuvākyā 12220 (invitatory prayer) 'catvāri śrogā' ('Agni has four horns,' Rg. IV. 58. 3, Tai, Ā X, 10.2) and offers the oblation with the Yājyā (offering prayer) 'tridhā hitam' (placed in three plates, Rg. IV, 58, 4) The Puronuvākya and Yājyā of the 2nd oblation of rice are 'tatsayitur parenyam' (Rg, III, 62, 10, Tai, S, I, 564) and 'yojayitri sünrtānām'. Of the third oblation the Puronuvākyā and Yājyā are respectively 'ye catvārah' (Tai. S V.7, 2. 3) and 'Dve sruti'(Rg, X. 88. 15, Tai Br. I. 4. 2. 3 ); the Puronuvākya and Yājyā of the 4th oblation are respectively 'agne naya' (Rg I. 189 1, Tai, S. 1 114. 3) and 'yā tiraścī' (Br, Up. VI. 3 1). 1223. Then he offers oblations of clarified butter with the Purusasūkta of 18 verses (Vaj. S. 31. 1-18, Tai, À, III, 12) and 1008, 108 or 28 oblations of clarified butter with the Gayatri verse. Then he goes to a spot where four roads meet, makes a gift of the needle, goad, ragged garment, the rope to a short-statured brāhmana who has a dark skin and having made him repeat the words 'May the servants of Yama be gratified' he places the jars on grains of rice. Having wound round the jars that are full of water threads he prepares an effigy of a human being, three threads for the head, three for the mouth, 21 for the neck, 4 for the body, two on each arm, one for the male organ, five for each of the feet with the words "May the revered Yama be pleased.' Then making ready the chair, washing it with pancagavya, he makes the effigy of a human being on black antelope skin with palaša stalks, he establishes the prānas in the effigy made on the jar and placing his body on the body made with stalks he should sleep. When he rises,

He should give dinner to brābmanas for the gratification of the servants of Yama. On the 4th day ha burns (the effigy) with mantras. He should offer water and pinda with the words 'pinda to me of such and such a gotra for benefit in the next world, svadhā namah.' With these words ho should bring to a close the ride. He should observe impurity for ten days for himself, but his agnates have not to observe impurity for him. On the 11th day he porforms ekoddista, They also cite the following verse 'one who is in distress, a woman and a śūdra having burnt one's body (ie effigy) with mantras should perform all rites on that very day. This is the revela tion. In the oase of women the rite is performed silently or with (?) Vedic mantras. In this way he should perform his own śrāddha every month for a year and at the end of each year up to twelve years. And then he should stop. When he is not able to do all these (himself) his son and the like may perform them. They also reoite the following verae; Although heirs may be alive one may perform one's śraddha while alive, having quickly set about doing everything according to the rules, except Sapindana. One should not make dolay as to the timo specified above, since life is evanescent," 

It may be noted that the Baud. grhyaģesasūtra III, 22 contains a very brief procedure of the same rite, but therein two verses of Kanya and one of Visnu are quoted. It appoars that this is a later addition. The text of Baud. grhyasosasūtra MI, 19 is quoted by Sr. Pr, pp. 361-363. But the Sraddha prakāśa also quotes a long passage from the Lingaporāda and explains it (pp. 363-368). The procedure in the Lingapurina, however, materially differs from that of Baudhāyana. It is passed over here from considerations of space. Tho Sriddha mayükha also gives an elaborate description. Somo of its provisions are stated here. In Jiyat-śrāddha tho word prola should nowhere be used. An effigy of the person is made with fifty kušas and is to be burnt by another with the mantra *kravyādam-agnim (Rg. X. 16, 9). The person has to kindla fire on the banks of a river with his face to the south with his grhya fire or ordinary fire and has to dig up & pit and mako & prayer to the earth as in the case of an actual death.

The provision of a śrāddha for a living person offered by himself is a perversion of the ancient idea of śrāddha. The basic and fundamental conception of a śrāddha was to gratify the spirits of deceased ancestors. People had gone crazy with the idea of srāddhas and invented this new mode to satisfy. that craze. I have known persons that performed Jiyat-śrāddha, though they had sons, younger brothers and nephews who would have certainly performed śrāddhas for them on their death, 

It is customary to make a gift of a cow with a calf to a brāhmada, praferably & kapilā cow, on the 2nd day after the period of āšauca Often times this is the only cow given, and the Cow called Vaitatani referred to above (p. 183, note 427) is rarely donated in the midst of the sorrow and turmoil immediately on the death of a dear and near relative. A declaration is first made that a gift of a cow will be made and then water is poured on the hand of a brābmana. Then holding kušas in his hand the donor makes a gift of the cow with a formula noted below 1224, The dones replies with the words 'om svasti' (Yes, inay it be well!). Then daksinā (in gold or silver coins ) is given and the brahmada says 'om svasti', holds the tail of the cow and repeats a Kāmastuti (eulogy of Kāma) 1225 according to the recension of the Veda he has studied. The Anušāsana. parva (57. 28–29 ) eulogises the gift of a kapilā cow with the calf, given with a milking pail of bell-metal, whose horn tips are decked with gold, by stating that such a gift not only saves the donor in the other world but also bis sons, grandsons and family for seven generations. The Anušāsanaparya (77.10 ff) sets out a legend why the kapilā сow is the best of all cows.

History of Dharmalāstra 

[Vol. Much is said on the question whether sraddhas should be performed in the intercalary month. The intercalary month is called by various names, vir, Malimluca (Kathaka Sam. 38. 14),1226 Samsarpa or Amhasaspati (Vajs.1.30 and 22.31), Mals māsa, Adhimāsa. An intercalary month is known even to the Rg veda (Rs. I.25.8). The vendor of soma and the thirteenth month are condemned as papa (sinful) in the Aitareya Brahmanasam. The Puranas tried to bolster up the intercalary month by calling it Parusottama-masa (1. e. the month of Visnu) but the origina] stigma attaching to the 13th month seczas to have persisted. The general rule about an intercalary month is stated by the Grhyaparisista.1228 "the month called Malimluca is pottuted and springs from sin; it is condemned for all acts; it should be discarded in all rites in honour of gods and pitrs. But exceptions to this sweeping prohibition have been recognized. Harita provides 1229 that all sraddhas that come after Sapindada are not to be performed in an intercalary month, Vydsa laid down 1230 that such ceremonies as jātakarma, apaaprāšana, the navašraddhas, sraddha on Maghā and the thirteenth tithi, the sixteen śrāddhas, bath, gifts, jape and śrāddha at the time of the eclipse of the sun or moon these should be performed byen in an intercalary month. The Smrtimuktāpbala concludes (p. 728) that there is no blemish in performing a sraddha in an intercalary month provided it is to be performed before the end of one year from death. It is provided by Burgu 1231 that tha sārnyatsarika sraddha of those who die in an intercalary month

may be performed in the intercalary month, but if there be none such then in the ordinary month of the same name, When the tithi for performing & śrāddha comes and there is then an intercalary month, Vrddha-Vasistha says that śrāddha should be performed in both months, 1232 

Further discussion about what may be done in Malamāsa and what is prohibited therein will be taken up in the section on Kala. The question as to the day on which a śrāddha is to be performed if the tuthi is spread over two days or if there is a hşaya of the tithi will also be discussed in that section, 

Some of the works on srāddha such as the Pfthyl-candro daya deal with what is called 'saoghāta-śrāddha.' 1232 When on the same day several persons die, but not at the same time, then the śrāddhas for them should be performed, as said by Rsyaśrnga, in the order in which they died. But if five or six persons die at the same time on the same day (as when a vessel sinks in the sea or a market is burnt down all at once ), then the order in which śrāddhas are to be performed is determined by the nearness of relationship to the perforiner of śrāddha in the case of each. For example, if a person's wife, son, brother and paternal uncle meet death at the same time, then the order should be this that the śrāddha of the wife is performed first, then of the son, then of the brother and then of the upole. If the parents die at the same time by accident, then the father's cremation or other rites should be first performed and then of the mother. 

Provision is made if the performance of a śrāddha is rendered impossible by some obstacle, Rsyasrnga provides 1233

If an obstacle arises at the time when an ekoddista is to be performed, the šrāddha should be performed in another month on the sane tithi. This last refers to a monthly śrāddha. If any of the sixteen śrāddhas fails owing to an obstacle it should be performed on the amārasyā or better still on the 11th day of the dark half. If there is an obstacle oning to impurity on death in the performance of a montbiş śrāddha or searis śrāddha it should be performed at the end of the impurity or on amārāstā. 134 The Padmapurāda (Palalakbanda 101, 68-70) Provides similar rules. obstacle is the performer's illness or his inability to collect

It may be - noted that while great emphasis Tas laid on inriting a very learned brābmapa at a śrāddha, that object was often frustrated in practice by the provisions made in certain smrtis that one izs should not partake of śrāddha food for three years after sapindana (which is often one year after death) and that by dining at a šrāddba in the first year one eats the bones and narror of the deceased, in the second year his flesh, in the third Fear his blood and stāddha in the 4th year is (somerhat) pare.

Kordic study since the should not is that this hest was 

placed before brāhmanas was that one, though entitled to accept gifts on account of his vedic learning and tapas, should not accept gifts, if he desires to secure the highest worla (Yā). I. 213), while Manu IV. 186 affirms 1236 that though entitled to accept gifts a brāhmana should not again and again resort to that method, since the spiritual power that he acquires- by Vedic study is lost by accepting gifts. Manu IV. 85-86 (= Padma V.19. 236-237) say that acceptance of a gift from the king is terrible (in its consequences) and Padma wards that gift appears sweet like honey but is like poison (i e, deadly in its effects). This reasoning applied with greater force to officiating and dining at a śrāddha, where not only gifts are to be received, but also sumptuous food that will please the palate 

is served in abundance, 

• It has been seen above how the most anciant' literary monument, viz the Rgveda, shows that the funeral rites per formed immediately after death were prompted by affectionate concern for the departed spirit mingled with some element of fear, that the object of those rites was to provide sustenance to the departed spirit and to endow it with an intermediate body before it became one of the pitrs. It has also been found that in the most ancient times of which we have literary evidence, there were rites for the worship of ancestors, being the Pinda pitryajña performed every month on amāvāsyā, the Mahāpitr yajña performed in the Sākamedha and the Astakā śrāddhas, Gradually the rites for deceased ancestors became more and more frequent, all-inclusive and elaborate, so that ultimately an exaggerated importance came to be attached to the cult of śrāddhas over which there was an enormous expenditure of time, effort and wealth. The question now arises what Indians of the 20th century should do about śrāddhas. One finds that in these days when many brāhmapas even do not engage in any of the five daily obligatory yajñas (the pañca-yajñas), they are so licitous to offer śrāddha at least once a year to their ancestors. The following may be therefore suggested as a via media for all kinds of people. Those who have faith in the daty of performing śrāddhas and their efficacy for the benefit of

the dead may perform them on a small scale, bearing in mind the emphatic admonition of Manu (NI, 125-126 ), the Kūrmapurāna II. 22, 27, Padmapurāna V, 9. 98 1237 that one should desist from extravagance in the matter of śrāddhas, particularly in the number of brāhmanas to be invited. Those whose faith is shaken or shattered by the onrush of modern ideas and English education or firm belief in the doctrines of Jourma and punarjanna should also remember one thing. The main underlying conception of śrāddha is certainly admirable, viz, a tender and affectionate regard for one's near and dear relatives. It is a good practice to set apart at least one day in a year for the remembrance of one's near and dear relatives that are no more, to invite relatives, friends, and learned people to a dinner in memory of the dead and to bestow monetary gifts on poor but learned persons of oharacter and devoted to the practice of plain living and high thinking, This will be in keeping with our past traditions and will also give a new orientation to and infuse new life into practices and usages that have become lifeless and meaningless to many people. From very ancient times one of the fundamental con ceptions of our faith has been the idea of three debts owed to sages, gods and pitrs. The debt owed to the ancestors is paid off by the procreation of a son who would offer pindas to his (and therefore also to his father's) ancestors, This is a grand conception, Nothing can be more sublime than the formula which one has to repeat at the time of offering pindas and water (with sesame) at Gayā 'may those of my ancestors that are in the form of pretas be all satiated by means of the (balls made) of barley flour mixed with sesame and may everything, whether moving or immoveable from Brahmā up to blades of

SECTION IV CHAPTER XI 

TIRTHAYĀTRĀ (pilgrimages to holy places) 

All religions have laid great emphasis on the sacredness of certain localities and have either ønjoined or recommended with great insistence pilgrimages to them. Among the five incumbent practical religious duties1237 of a Moslem, pilgrimage at least once in kis life to Mecoa and Medina, the birth place and burial place of the prophet Mohammad, is one. The four places of pilgrimage for Buddhists have been the place of the birth of Buddha ( Lumbini or Rumpindei), the place where he attained perfect enlightenment (Bodh Gayā), the place where he set in motion the wheel of dharma by delivering his first sermon (at Sārnāth near Benares ) and the place where he passed away into the state of nirvana (Kusinārā). Vide Mahāparinibbanasutta (S B. E vol. XL. P 90). For Christians Jerusalem has been the holiest place and no religious com munity except the Christians undertook in historic times several great military pilgrimages, The crusades were launched to free the Holy Land of Christians from the domination of Moslems. In spite of what Gibbon says 1238 gomewhat oynically about those who joined the crusades, it must be admitted that there were thousands among the crusaders who risked their lives and fortunes in the pursuit of an ideal In India holy places have played a very important part. Large rivers, mountains and forests have always been venerated as sacred1239 

1237. Vide S B E vol. VI, Introduction LXXI, for the five duties The pilgrimage 13 called Hāy and the Moslem who performs it is entitled to be called Haji 

1238 Gibbon remarks 'At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the sacendiary, the homicide arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they bad exercised against their christian brethren and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every raok and denomination.

and as the abodes of gods. In ancient and medieval India pilgrimages brought many advantages to the community as well as to the pilgrims themselves. Though India was divided into many kingdoms and the people of India followed several cults and sub-cults, pilgrimages tended to foster the idea of the essential and fundamental unity of Indian culture and of India also. Benares and Rāmeśvata were held sacred by all Hindus, whether they hailed from the north of India or from the peninsula. Though the Hindu community was broken up into numerous castes and suffered from caste exclusiveness, pilgrim ages tended to level up all men by bringing them together to the same holy rivers or shrines. The traditions associated with holy places, the discipline through which the pilgrims passed, association with holy and philosophic men and the whole atmos phere and environment at tij thas made it easy for pilgrims to remain at a high spiritual level and inculcated in them a mood of reverence that lasted long even after they returned from the pilgrimage, Pilgrimages supplied the much needed stimulus to draw ordinary men away from selfish pursuits and to make them think of the higher and more enduring moral and spiritual values These obvious benefits and the belief that a holy place was the abode of some divinity led ancient dharmaśāstra writers to lay emphasis on visits to tirthas The Visnu Dh. S, provides 1240 that the dlarma common to all men comprises the following: forbearance, truthfulness, restraint of the mind, cleanliness, charity, control of the senses, ahamsā, obedience to elders, visiting holy places, compassion, straightforwardness,

freedom from a varice, honouring gods and brābmanas and freedom from jealousy. Modern men whose faith in some of the aspects of the religious beliefs of our forefathers has beon weakened or altogether sapped by the sight of the profesional ministrants at the tirthas and their rapacity and ignoranco should not judge the ancient attitude towards tirthas harshly. 

The word tirtha ocours frequently in the Rgveda and other Vedic sambitās. In several passages of the Rgyeda tirtha appears to mean a road or & vay (0.g. in Rg. I 169 6 'tirtha Dāryah paumsyāni tasthuh', Rg I 173 11 tirthe Dācchi tālrsādam-oko', Rg IV, 29, 3 'karan-na Indrak sutirthabhayam ca.' In some places tirtha may be taken to meau a ford in & river, as in Rg VIII. 47. 11' "sutirtham-arvato yathānu no nøsathā sugam &c.', Rg. I. 46. 8 *aritram vam divas.prthu tirthe sindhūnām rathah'. In Rg. X 31 3 *trthe na dasmam upa yantyümāk', tirtha probably means 'a holy place'. On Rg VII. 19. 37 "Suyāstya adhi tugvanı' the Nirukta IV. 15 explains that Supāstu is a Tiger and tuguan means 'tirtha' (either a ford or a holy spot) In the Tai. S. VI 1. 2. 1-2 1245 it is said that the sacrificer is to bathe at a tirtha (probably a holy river ). The Rudras are said to prow} about tirthas (yo tirthāni pracaranto srkāvanto nisanginah) zo Tai S IV.5.11,1-2 and Vāj S. 16. 61 (reads 'srkāhastā). In the sankhāyana Br.iz!? it is said that Day and Night are the sea that absorbs overy thing and the twilights are the unfatbomable liitlas (of tho sea). Tirtha also means the way between the 'utkara' and "cātvāla' pit for going to or coming from the sacrificial ground (the whāra ).1242& Vide H of Dh vol II. p. 984, 

It is said that, just as some parts of the human body (e. g. the right hand or ear) are held to be puror (than others), 80 some localities on the earth ara held to be very loly. Ifrtlas are held to be holy (on three grounds, viz.) on account of somo wonderful natural characteristic of the locality or on account of the peculiar strikingness (or grondcur) of somo satory placo or on account of the fact that somo (holy ) sages resorted to

them (for bathing, austerities &c.). Tirtha, therefore, means a locality or spot or expanse of water which gives rise to the accumulation of righteousness (merit) owing to its own peculiar nature without any adventitious circumstance (such as the presence of Sālagrāma near it).1243 Or it is better to say that those localities that have been technically spoken of by vise and great sages as tirthas are tirthas, just as Pāvini employs such technical terms as Nadi and Vṛddhi in his grammar, The Skandapurāna 1214 says that a spot of the earth resorted to by ancient good men for the collection of merit is called tirtha and that the main thing is to go to (i, o associate with holy ) men and pilgrimage is only a secondary object, 

In the Rgveda waters, rivers in general and certain named rivers 1245 are referred to with great reverence as holy and are deified. In Rg VII. 49 the refrain of all four verses is 'may the divine waters protect me' (taapo devir-iha mamavantu). In Rg. VII. 49. 1 waters are spoken of as purifying (punanah ). RE. VII. 47,x.9,x. 30 1346 are hymns addressed to waters as divinities. They are said to purify a man not only physically but are also invoked to rid a man of all sins and lapses from the right path. The Tai S. II. 6.8.3 asserts that all deities are centred in waters (āpo vai sarvā devatah). In the Atharvaveda 1247 (I 33.1) waters are described as holy and purifying and are invoked to confer happiness. About twenty rivers in all

Sarasvati in the Rgveda 

557 

flood of the Sarasvati impinging by its powerful waves against the tops of hills is referred to in Rg. VI. 61. 2 and 8 1250. In VII, 96. 1, Sarasvati is spoken of as asuryā (of divine origin) among rivers. Sacrifices are said to have been performed on the Disadvati, the Āpayā and Sarasvati (Rg. II. 23. 4). In Rg. II, 41, 16 Sarasvati is called the best of rivers and goddesses (ambitame naditame devitame Sarasvati). Rg. I 3. 11-12 praise 1251 Sarasvati as a river and a deity, as a purifier (pāvaka), as the impeller of sweet but truthful words and the inspirer of good thoughts and as bringing to notice its great flood of waters. From Rg. VII, 95. 2, VIL 49.2 and I 71, 7 it is obvious that the Rgvedic sages know that the seven rivers fell into the sea. It would be proper to hold that the seven rivers are Sindhu (Indus), the five rivers of the Panjab and the Sarasvati. Though from the Rgpeda passages cited above it appears that in the times of the hymns of the Rgveda Sara Svati was a big river with abundant waters, that it flosed between the Yamunā and Sutudri (X. 75. 5), in the times of the Brahmanas it disappeared in the sands It is now gene rally identified with the modern Sarsuti which is lost in the desert at Bhatnair. The Vāj. S. 34. 11 says that five rivers together with their tributary streams fall into Sarasvati, 1252 There were three sattras called Sarasvata, viz the first in hon our of Mitra and Varuna, the 2nd for Indra and Agni and the third for Aryaman The diksā (consecration ceremony) was to be performed on the south bank of the dry bad of the Saras Vati where it disappeared underground 1253.

The land between Vinasana and Plaksa Prāsra vana (which was the sourca of the Sarasvati) was the proper locality for Sarasvata sattra, At the confluence of Sarasvati and Drsadvati an eşti to Apam Napāt was performed wherein boiled rice (caru) was the offering. From the place where the Sarasvati disappeared up to Plaksa-Prāsravada the distance was a journey on horsa-back for forty days and nights When the sacrificers (in the sattra) reach Plaksa Prāgravana thoy sliould stop the parformance of the items of the sattra and undergo the Avabhrtha bath near the river Yamunā (modern Jumna) which flows through the country called Karapacava (and not in the Sarasvati even if it had water) For details, vide Katyāyana Srautasūtra (10. 15-19) which mentions (in 10. 19.1) a spot called Parinah in Kuruksetra where the Vedic fires were to be kindled, the Āśv, S. 8 12 6 1-28 which adds that at the distance of each throw of the Samyā from the Vinaśana one day is to be spent by the sacrificers, the Katyayana Srauta-sūtra (24.5-6) which states that the isti of the confluence of tbe Disadvati and Sarasvati is to bo offered to Agai Kāma, Ap.

Devala 1255 mentions several places as Sarasvata tirthas. The Rgveda 1256 VIII. 6.28 appears to hold that the valleys of mountains and the confluences of rivers are sacred Mountains have been held by most ancient peoples to be the abodes of gods. Mount Parnassus north of Delphi was one of the most holy mountains in classical Greece and Olyaipus was supposed to be the home of the gods. In the Rgveda Parvata is a dual deity with Indra 'O, Indra and Parvata! may you two sharpen (or purify) us (our intellects) Rg I 122 3 1257; 0, Indra and Parvatal May you tvo, being in the forefront of battle, kill with the thunderbolt every one who desires to attack us with an army' Rs. I 132.6. In Rg. VI. 49. 14 a prayer is addressed to Parvata separately 'May the god Abibudhnya, may Parvata and may Sayitr bestow on us food together with the waters on account of our prayers'. In Rg II, 331 the two great rivers Vipas (modern Beas) and Sutudri are described as issuing from the lap of mountains. Here the word 'Parvata' is used in its ordinary sense. The Atharvaveda 1253 speaks of a salve (āñjana) from Traikakuda peaks of the Himālaya mountain 'May that salve which comes off the Himalaya from Traiçakuda (peaks) destroy all wizards and all witches'.

[Vol. refers to this salve. Gaut., Baud Dh S.and Vas. Dh. S. have the same sūtra 1259 stating that the 'deśas (localities) that are holy and hence destroyers of sin are all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (rsis), cowpens and temples of the gods' The Vayupurāna 1260 and Kūrma state that all parts of the Himalaya are holy, the Ganges is holy everywhere, all rivers falling into the sea and all seas are holy. The Padmapurāna (Bhūmikhanda 39. 46-47) says that all rivers, whether flowing through a village or a forest, are holy and that where no name of a tirtha on rivers is known it should be called Visputirtha. Kālıdāsa speaks of the Himālaya as devatātmā (as vivified by the presence of gods) in the Kumārasambhava (I1). The Bhagavata V. 19.16 names 27 holy mountains while the Brahmānda (II. 16. 20-23) names thirty. The grandeur and sublimity of snow-capped mountains, of large life-sustaining rivers and of great forests easily in press the minds of almost all people and induce them to think that there is something divine about them, that the Supreme

Effect of holy places on the mind 

561 

Being is partially revealed in such surroundings. In Protestant Europe and the U.S.A. hardly anyone performs a pilgrimage to a holy place in these days. Instead, they tour different countries for rest, health and in search of natural beauty and a respite from humdrum existence But pilgrimage to a place supposed to be holy for the curing of disease is not rare even now. When one reads a work like that of Louis Carell, a great surgeon and a winner of the Nobel prize, on the miracles worked at Lourdes in France (in a journey to Lourdes') one sees that pilgrimage has taken on a new motive in the West. Similarly, pilgrimage to the tombs of unknown warriors las become common owing to the two world wars. 

In Rg x. 146 a large forest 1261 (Aranyani) is invoked as a deity. The Vamanapurana mentions 1252 seven forests in Kuruksetra as holy and as removers of sin, viz. Kamyaka, Aditirana, Vyasavana, Phalakivana, Suryavana, Madhuvana and Punyasitarana, 

In the Sūtras and ancient smrtis like those of Man and Yajñaralkya tirthas do not occupy a very prominent position. But in the Mahabharata and the Purāpas they are highly lauded and placed eren above sacrifices, In the Vanaparva 1263 a com parison is made between sacrifices to gods and pilgrimages, Sacrifices require numerous implements, collection of materials, the co-operation of priests and the presence of a wife and 'so

[Vol. they can be performed only by princes or rich men, They can not be performed by poor men, who are devoid of wealth, who are without a wife and without friends, who are helpless. The reward that a wan gets by visiting holy places cannot be secured by performing such sacrifices as Agnistoma in which large fees are paid (to priests); therefore visiting holy places is superior to sacrifices. But the Mahābhārata (Vadaparya 82, 9-12 and Anušāsana 108. 3-4) Jays the greatest emphasis on the cultivation of high moral and spiritual qualities if the full reward of pilgrimages is to be reaped. It says 1264 'He whose hands, feet and mind are well controlled and who possesses know ledge, austerities and a good reputation derives the (full) reward of pilgrimages. He who turns his face away from receiving gifts and is content with what little he gets and is free from vanity obtains the towards of pilgrimages, He, who is free from hypoc risy (or deceit), is not engaged in various undertakings (for earning money), is not a heavy eater, has subdued his senses and is (therefore) free from all sios; 80 also he who does not fly into a rage, who always speaks the truth, who is firm in his observances, and acts towards all beings by treating them like himself, obtains the full reward of pilgrimages. The idea seems to be that pilgrimages may help to remove the sins of men who are not possessed of the above characteristics, while those who possess these acquire a great store of merit in addition, The Skanda (Kāśikhanda 6.3) asserts "snāng cannot bo predioated of a man whose body alone is flooded with water; that man who is plunged in restraint of senses, who is pure, relieved of all taint and is stainless, is alone to be called anāta' (as having had a bath). The Anusāsana has almost the same

One who has no faith, who is full of sins, whose mind is not free from doubts ( about the rewards of pilgrimages and the rites there), who is an atheist and who is bent on bad reasoning these five do not reap the rewards of pilgrimages'. The Skandapurāna (I. 1. 31, 37 ) remarks that all holy places, sacrifices and various gifts are meant for cleansing the mind (of its sins and sinful proclivities, manah-suddhi). The Padmapurana (IV. 80.9) remarks: sacrifices, vratas, tapas and dāna cannot be carried out fully in the Kali age; but bathing in the Ganges and taking the name of Hari are free from all defects, The Visbudharmottarapurāpa 1266 puts the matter very clearly when it says 'When resort is made to a tirtha, it removes the sins of the sinful and tends to the increase of merit in the case of the good and that a boly place yields fruit to men of all varnas and aśramas,' Some of the Purāpas (such as Skandapurana, Kāśikhanda 6, Padma, Uttarakhanda, 237) say that in addition to the holy places on land (bhauma) there are certain virtues that may be called mental tirthas (in a figurative sense ). According to them "truthfulness, forbear ance, restraint of the senses, compassion for all beings, straight-forwardness, charity, self-control, contentment, celibacy (brahmacarya), sweet speech, knowledge, patience, austerity, are tirthas and the highest tirtha is purity of mind.' They further state that a man who is avaricious, wicked, cruel, hypocritical and immersed in pleasures of senses is still sinful and impure even if he bathes in all tirthas and that fish are born and die in holy waters but they do not go to heaven because their minds are not purified and that even charity, sacrifices, austerity,

Wherever a man who has his senses under control may dwell, there are present Kuruksetra, Prayaga and Puskara', The Vamanapurana has a finet267a Rupala about the soul being a river full of the water of control, flowing with truth and having character as the bank and the vapes of compassion (for all beings) and states that the soul cannot be purified by water. The Padmapurana (II. 39. 56-61) extends the meaning and scope of tirthas by remarking that places where Agnihotra and śrāddha are performed, a temple, a house sphere Veda is being studied, a cowpen, the place where a soma drinker dwells, parks, a place where the Aśvattha .exists, a place where Purāna is being recited or where one's teacher stands or where a obaste housewife dwells, or where a father and & worthy son dwell are all holy. 

Numberless tirthas and holy shrines have been mentioned from ancient times. The Matsyapurada states 1268 that Vayu declared that there are 35 millions of tirthas in the sky, in the ærial regions and on the earth and all of them are centred in the Ganges; while the Vamanapurana 46. 58 states that there are 35 millions of Lingas. The Brahmapurana says that the number of tirthas and shrines is so large that they cannot be ____1267, सत्य तीर्थ क्षमा तीर्थ .तीर्धानामुत्तम तीर्थ विशुद्धिर्मनस' पुन जायन्ते च नियन्तेच जलेष्वेव जलौकस । न च गच्छन्ति ते स्वर्गमविशुद्धमनोमलाः॥ दानभिज्या तप शौचं तीर्थसेवा शुतं तथा! सर्वाण्येतान्यतीर्थानि यदि भावो न निर्मल । स्कन्द, काशी- b. 28-45, पा, उतरखण्ड 237. 11-28, compare मल्य 22 80 (सत्य ती दया तीर्थः).

enumerated in detail even in hundreds of years. The Vanaparva 1269 remarks that Naimisa is the (best) tirtha on the earth and Puskara in the ærial region, while Kuruksetra is the most distinguished in all the three worlds and that all the ten thousand crores of tirthas are present in Puskara (chap 82.21 ) New tirthas were added from time to time and the monetary benefits derived by the permanent residents and particularly by the tirtha priests led them to prepare numerous mabātmyas of an apocryphal character and father them on Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahabharata and the Purānas. Most of the writers of digests on tirthas follow a process of selection. The Tirthakalpataru of Laksmidhara, one of the earliest digesta (about 1110-1120 AD), depotes more than half the work to Varāpasi and Prayāga alone, assigns only two or three pages to such famous tirthas as Puskara, Pţthûdaka, Kokamukha, Badarikaśrama, Kedāra. The Nisimhaprasāda (Tirthasara) mostly deals with tirthas in the Deccan and southern India such as Setubandha, Pundarika (modern Pandharpur), Godavari, Krsna-venyā, Narmadā. The Tri. sthalīgetu of Narayanabhatta devotes two-thirds of it to Benares and its sub-tirthas and the rest to Prayaga and Gaya. This unequal treatment arose from various causes, such as the locali ties where the authors lived, their familiarity with the holy places and their predilections. There was also another tendency among the authors of Purānas, Mābātnyas and digests viz, that of great exaggeration and over-statement which is often repellent. If a man reads the description of one tirtha and does not discount much as sheer hollow laudation, he is likely to feel that a pilgrimage to a certain tīrtha will yield all the desires in this life as well in the next and that after visiting a holy tirtha like Kāśi or Prayāga he need not go to any other tīrtha, nor need he perform any yastia or act of charity and the like. A fesy striking passages may be cited here. The Vanaparva remarks that 1770 even gods and sages secured

perfection at Puskara and that whoever takes a' bath there and devoutly worships gods and his pitrs secures towards ten times of what the performance of Ašvamedha might give. About this very tirtha viz. Puskara, the Padmapurāna says that there is no holier tirtha in this world. The Vanaparva (83. 145) in its eulogy of Prthūdaka asserts that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is' holier than Kuruksetra and that Prthūdaka is holier than all other tirthas The Matsyapurāna puts the 1271 comparative holiness of several tirthas thus the waters of the Sarasvati purify after (one bathes for) three days, those of Yamunā in seven days, those of the Ganges at once, while the water of the Narmadā purifies a man at sight of it." In 'ita eulogy of Vārānasi the Kūrma-purapa states there is no place higher than Vārāpasi nor will there be one' (I. 31 64). The inveterate habit of exaggeration goes so far that it is said that by merely residing in Kāšī till one's death not only does a man become free from the great sin of brāhmada murder but from the never-ending cycle of births and deaths and 18 not born again.1272 The Lingapurada says the same thing. The Vāmana. purāpa remarks 1273 that muhtı (release from samsāra) can be secured in four ways, viz, by knowledge of Brahman, by śrāddha at Gaya, by loss of life in repelling the carrying away of cows and by residence in Kuruksetra and that those who die in Kuruksetra never come down (to the earth) Mere residence in Kāśi was so much lauded that the Matsya (181 23), the Agni (112, 3) and other Purānas say that after repairing to Kāsī one should smash one's feet with a stone (in order that

one may not be induced to visit another tirtha) 1274 and stay in Kāšī forever, 

The Brahmapurana classifies tirthas into four divisions 1775 yiz, daiva (created by gods ), āsura (those associated with such asuras as Gaya), ārsa (those established by sages ) such as Prabhāsa, Naranārāyaba and mānusa (created by kings like Ambarisa, Manu, Kuru) and provides that each preceding one is superior to each succeeding one. It enumerates six rivers to the south of the Vindhya and six rivers having their sources in the Himālayas as most holy and as devatirthas, viz. Godavari, Bhimarathi, Tungabhadrā, Venikā, Tāpi, Payasnı, Bhāgirathi, Narmada, Yamunā, Sarasvati, Visokā, and Vitastā. Similarly, Kāśi, Puskara and Prabhāsa are devatirthas (Tirthapr. r 18). The Brahmapurāpa (175. 31-32) assigns daiva, āsura, ārsa and manusa tirthas respectively to the Krta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali yugas, 

There is a good deal of discussion in the Purānas and digests about those who are entitled or have the eligibility or capacity (adhikara) for tirtbayātra. The Vanaparva 1276 provides that brālmapas, ksatriyas, yaiśyas and sūdras, when they have bathed in holy places, are not born again. The same work further states that whatever sin a man or a woman may have committed from birth, the inoment a person takes a bath in the holy Puskara all that sin vanishes 1277 Therefore not only men but women also had the right to undertake tirthayātrā. The Matsyapurāna 1278 goes further and asserts that. Avimukta

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. (Vārānasl) is the highest cure for men of numerous castes, for men not (recognized as ) belonging to any particular warna, for candālas who are abhorred (by people ) and for persons whose bodies are full of diseases and of aggravated sins' It is stated in the Vamanapurāda: 1279 persons of all the four ātramas (i, e. brahmacārins, householders, forest hermits and sannyü sins ) by bathing in the tirtha (mentioned by it) sare seven generations in their families and that persons belonging to the four vardas and women, when they bathe in tirthas with devotion, see the highest goal. It was provided by the Brahmapurāpa that a brahmacāriu can undertake a pilgrimage only if ordered or directed by his guru, and that a booseholder whose wife is alive and is chaste must go on a pilgrimage with her; otherwise he would not reap the fruit of pilgrimage The Padmapurāna (Bhumikhanda chap. 59-60 ) narrates the story of a vaiśya called Krkala who went on a pilgrimage with out his virtuous wife and did not reap the fruits of a long pilgrimage (bhāryām vinā yo dharmaḥ sa eva piphalo bharebe 59, 33). The Tīrtbacintamani and Tirthaprakāśa quote 8 passage (from the Kūrmapurāna) which glorifies Vārānast (called Avimukta there ) as follows 1280 'brahmanas, ksatriyas, Vaisyas, šūdras, persons of mixed oastes (vardasankara), women, mlecchas and others who are born in avıl forms and are of mixed blood, worms, ants, birds and beasts when they die in Avimukts are born as human beings in Benares and no one guilty of sins dying in Ayjmukta goes to Hell' As regards 1331 women and śūdras, a smrti verse provided 'Japa, tapas, pilgrim age to holy places, becoming an ascetic (sannyāsin), efforts to attain mastery over mantras and worshipping deities (as a priest)--these six. lead to sinfulness in the case of women and

sūdras.' This was explained away by stating that this text refers to undertaking pilgrimage without the husband's pormis sion (in the case of a woman) and as to a sūdra in such a way as to be opposed to the primary duty of a śūdra to wait upon learned brāhmapas (as laid down in Madu X. 123). Kātya yana1282 as quoted in the Vyavahāramayūkha provides 'whatever a woman does that relates to (benefit in) a future state (i.e. state after death) without the permission of her husband's) father, husband or son, would become fruitless' It is clear therefore that it was recognized early that tirthayātrā was a popular way for redemption of sins in the case of all classes of men and women. Though a Hindu woman succeeding as heir to her husband's estate has only a limited and qualified ownership over it, judioial decisions have recognized that she can alienate a small portion of her husband's estate for the expenses of a pilgrimage to Gayā for performing her husband's śrāddha for the latter's spiritual benefit or of a pilgrimage to Pandharpur. Vide Muteeram v. Gopal 11 Beng. L. R. 416; Darbari Lal v. Gobind 46 All. 822; Ganpat v.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. There is a verse of Brlaspati: 'At holy places, in marriages, in a religious festival (or procession), in a battle, when there is en invasion of the country and when a town or village is on firo, no blaze attaches on the ground of incurring contact with untouchable persons or things,' 

In order to guard against the facile assumption that without a change of heart or change in one's sinful mode of life a more physical act of pilgrimage and bath in holy waters would be enough, some of the texts in the Mahablārata and Puranas adopted two propositions; viz the one noted above that it is the pure mind that is a real tirtha and further emphasized that it is better to stay at homo and perform all the duties of a householder including the perform ance of vedio sacrifices than to go on a pilgrimage. The Škods parva 1785 in the dialogue between Tuladhāra and Jõjali (3 brābmana proud of his tapas) asserts that purodāsa is tho holiest of offerings, that all rivers are (holy lika) Sarasvati and all hillocks (and not merely Himalaya and the like ) are holy, that one's soul is a tirtha and advises Jajali not to be a gost (i. e. to be wandering in quest of tirthas ) to several countries, The Tirthagintāmaņi and Tirthaprakaś& quote passages from the Brahmapurāpa that a brāhmaps should yander about tirthas after his capacity to perform sacrifices has come to an end, that it is better for a man to stay at home and porform the duties of an householder when he has the capacity and authority to perform rstis and arnas, and that all the tirthas: do not come up in their rovards) to the performance of agnihotra. 1226 The Kūrmapurāna 1287 has the following remark able verses on this point. That person who abandoning huis proper duties 1287 resorts to tirthas does not reap the fruits of

pilgrimage in this world as well as in the next. A person who has to undergo an expiation (for a sin), or who is a widower or who is a householder of the yāyāvara 1288 type or similar persons may resort to pilgrimages. One may go to holy places with his vedic fires or with his wife; he becomes free from all sins and secures the best goal as stated above. One who wants to go on pilgrimages should pay off the three debts, should provide means of maintenance for his sons and should consign his wife to their care.' 

Ancient writers on Dharmasastra favoured pilgrimages by prescribing, as stated in the Visau Dh. S, that 1289 no money was to be demanded from a Vedic student, a forest hermit, an ascetic, a pregnant woman and a pilgrim by a forryman or by & toll officer and that if he took money from such persons he was to be made to return it. But this prescription was not invariably followed even by Hindu Kings The Rājatarangin (VI 254-255 and VII, 1008) notices that a tax was levied on Kashmirians performing sraddhas at Gayā.1296 It appears that Siddharāja king of Anahilavād (1095–1143 A. D.) levied a tax on pilgrims going to Somanatha at the frontier town Bābuloda, that he remitted the tax at the intercession of his mother and that the tax thus remitted amounted to 72 lakhs of rupees every year (this last may be an exaggeration to glorify Siddharāja),1290 a Moslem kings levied this tax. It appears that a great writer called Kavindrācārya took up the cause of Hindu pilgrims visiting Prayāga and Kāšī and so eloquently pleaded it before Emperor Shah Jehan that the latter remitted the tax altogether 

1288. A householder is said to be of two sorts, salīna and yāyāvara. The latter is one who subsists by picking up grains that fall down when the cord that is reaped is taken from the fields to the house or thresbing floor or who does not accumulate wealth or who does not earn bis livelihood by oficiating as a priest or by teaching or by accepting gifts.

and conferred upon the great scholar 1291 the title of 'Sarya vidyā-nidhāna'. People throughout India felt such relief at the remission of the tax that congratulatory letters and addresses (several of them couched in very poetic language) poured upon Kavindrācārya. These have been published in & work styled 'Kavindra-candrodaya' by Dr. Har Dutta Sharma and Mr. M. M, Patkar in the Poona Oriental series), a characteristic Verse from which 18 quoted below.1292 In a remarkable copper plate Inscription in Sanskrit 1293 and Kannada issued by the Hoysala king Narasimha III in Magba šalce 1200 (1279 1. D) it is said that the king granted the revenues (amounting to 645 niskas & year) of a village called Hebbāle to the pilgrims of Kasi and to god Srivišrašyara for the purpose of enabling the pilgrims to Benares (including those from the whole of Karnataka, from the countries of Telingapa, Tulu, Tirhut, Ganda and others) to pay off the tax levied by the Turuskos (Moslom kings ).1293 

The digests quote certain verses of the Brahmapurana about the rites to be performed when a person decides to start on a pilgrimage. The Brahmapurāna provides that the intend. ing pilgrim should restrain his senses the previous day, should observe & fast and on the next day he should offer for ship to Ganeša, the gods, the pitrs and honour good brābmanas according to his ability and when he returns from the pilgrimage he should offer similar worship and honour. 1994 The digests

He should perform sraddha in which there is plenty of ghee, honour three brāhmadas (at least) with the offer of sandalwood paste &c. and then make a resolve (sankalpa) to go on pilgrim age The Vayupurāna 1295 and the digests lay down that (after the worship of Ganesa, the planets and the deities) he should put on the dress of a kārpatī viz. wear a copper-ring, a copper bracelet and reddish garments. Bhattoji (p 5) states that according to some the apparel of kārpatika is to be put on by a pilgrim going to Gayā. The Padma (IV. 19. 22) prescribes the pilgrim's dress for other tirthas also. The Tīr, O. adds that this dress is to be worn only on the journey to a tīrtha, when the pilgrim is in a tirtha, but not at the time of performing his daily duties such as taking meals (p. 9). 

There is a difference of opinion among the digests as to whether tonsure of the head is obligatory when starting on a pilgrimage. The Padmapurāna 1296 and Skandapurana appear to make it obligatory. The Tirtha-Kalpataru does not 1297 refer to tonsure at all, while a fast at a tīrtha is declared by it to be optional. The tendency of later digest-writers is generally to make every religious act more elaborate and harder. The tonsure of the head and beard was prescribed for a sacrificer

Both Tir C. and Tir. Pr. quote a verse 1301 which says that tonsure and fast are acts that must be done at all tirthas except at Kuruksetra, Višālā (Ujjayini or Badarikā), Virajā (river in Orisse) and Gaya.'

Tonsure for women at tīrthias

in the case of women whose husbands are living only two finger breadths of hair are cut. Vžddha-Hārita (IX. 386-387) lays down that in the case of women whose husbands are living tonsure of the head should not be carried out, but that holding up all their hair only three finger-breadths should be cut off. Other smrtis like Āpastamba in verse (I. 33-34), Angiras Verse 163, Yama 54-55, Parāšara q. by the Mitāksarā on Yāj. III, 263-264 lay down that tonsure is limited to the cutting of two finger-breadths of hair in the case of woman (nārī). Par, M. 1302 I. 1. p. 291 reads 'evam nārīkumārinām' and holds that nāri means here 'a woman whose busband is alive'. Although tlę smrti passages occur in the section on prāyaścitta still by analogy they are to be applied to the tonsure in holy places. As regards widovs, ascetics 1303 and šūdras all hair are to be cut. The Tirthaprakāśa finds fault with Vācaspatimiśra for saying that there is no tonsure on the Ganges. When there is such a conflict of views, the final decision rests with the usage of each country or the individual's choice. The Tir. K. (p 10) appears to hold that honouring the pitrs at the time of starting on a pilgrimage is specially obligatory on a man with means. The texts make a difference between ksaura and mundana. The latter means 'shaving the hair on the head as well as the mousta ache and beard,' while ksaura means only shaving the head, Therefore the Nāradiya says that all sages did not prohibit ksaura even at Gayā but only mundana is forbidden there 13034 and there is no mundana on the Ganges anywhere except at Prayāga The Tirthendusekhara (p 7) gives it as its opinion that tonsure and fast are not obligatory but are only kāmya (1, e. to be done if certain rewards are desired) and points out that śistas do not resort to these two at many tirthas.

The Purānas and digests devote some attention to the inode of travel, The Matsya (106. 4-6) states that 1304 if a pilgrim goes to Prayāga in a conveyance drawn by bulls he falls into hell and his pitrs do not accept the water offered by him at the holy place and if a pilgrim because of riches or avarice or foolishness goes in a conveyance (not drawn by bulls) all his effort (as a pilgrim) becomes fruitless and therefore a pilgrim should avoid Journey in a conveyance. According to the Kalpataru (on Tirtha p. 11) using a conveyance is forbidden only in the case of pilgrimage to Prayāga (and pot in the case of other tirthas), while the Tir, C. (p. 8) and Tir, Pr. (p. 45) quote a verse 1305 which provides that if a pilgrim uses a cart drawn by bulls he is guilty of govadha (kıllıng a cow), if he travels on horse-back (or in a horse-drawn carriage) his pilgrimage yields no fruit, if he is carried by men (in a palan quin or the like) he secures only half the merit but if he travels bare-footed then he wins the full merit. The Padma-purana (IV. 19. 27) has a similar verse. The Tīr. Pr. p. 34 quotes a yerse from the Kūrmapurāna that those who are unable to perform a pilgrimage otherwise do not incur blame (or Joss) by making use of a conveyance drawn by mon or a chariot which is drawn by mules or horses. Similarly, a verse of the Vişnupurāna 1306 quoted by both Tir O and Tir. Pr. (pp. 34-35) provides that one should always go on a journey wearing shoes and holding an umbrella in the rains or in summer and armed with a staff at night or 10 & forest. The Visnudharmottara takes a more practical view when it says that to make a pil

Declaration before starting

grimage on foot is the highest tapas (austerity) and that if a pilgrimage be made in a conveyance the pilgrim will reap only the Teard of the bath. The Tir. Pr. (p. 35) allows the use of a Tessel to reach holy places like Gangāsāgara which cannot be reached otherwise. 

The Tristhali-setu (pp. 1-3) has a long discussion about the sajhalpa 1507 (declaration) to be made at the time of start ing on a pilgrimage. The conclusions reached are that the declaration should not include the dames of all the holy places intended to be visited, but should expressly state the last one up to which one desires to go, that persons from southern or Western India should make a sankalpa about Gaya (and pilgri mage to Prayāga and Kāši vill be implied) and that a person from East India should make a sankalpa about Prayaga (and pilgrimage to Gaya and Kašī will be included as a matter of course) and that (as an alternative method) a man from south or vest India should at first make a sankalpa about pilgrimage to Prayāga, then while in Prayāga he should make a sankalpa about visiting Kāśi and then in Kāśī he should make a sankalpa about visiting Gayā, A pilgrim from Eastern India should first make a sankalpa about Gayā, then, while in Gaya, he should make one about Kāśī and so on. The Tīrthaprakāśa (p. 326) appears to criticize the first method proposed by the Tristhslisetu and states its own view to be that those who intend to visit many sacred places should make a sankalpa in the form 'I shall perform pilgrimage' (Tirtha-gātrāmalam karisye). The Tirthaprakāśa, however, approves of the second method proposed as an alternative. 

That the merit of a pilgrimage could be collected in a vicarious manner is laid down by the Smrtis and Puranas. Atri (50-51) provides 1305 'He for whom an effigy nade with kuša grass intending it as a representative is dipped in the waters of a holy place secures one-eighth part of the merit (that he rould have secured by himself bathing in the waters).

History of Dharmasastra of his mother, father, brother, friend or guru, these latter receive one-twelfth of the fruit (of the pilgrimage). Another verse of Paithinasi says that he who yisits a holy place for money (wages) from another gets only a 16th part of the merit, but he who goes to a tirtha while bent on another purpose or errand (such as study, business, waiting on a guru) 1309 reaps only half the merit. The Virpudharmottara has a similar verse. It was owing to this idea of collecting morit and God's Grace that wealthy men built Dharmaśālās, tants, and annasattras and wells for the conveniences of pilgrims and the planting of trees by the sides of roads had in view the comfort of pilgrims as yell as of the general public The Prabhasa khanda remarks 'A wealthy man who enables another to perform pilgrimage by providing his own money or conveyances gets one-fourth of the merit of the pilgrimage.' 1310 

The Prayascittatattva of Raghunandana quotes from the Brahmāndapurāna some verses which enumerate fourteen acts that a pilgrim has to give up after reaching the Ganges viz, sauca (punctulious performance of bodily purification), acanana (sipping water on various occasions in the day), hai (dress ing), wearing nirmalya (flowers taken away after being offered in worship), repeating the Aghamarsana hynn (Rg. 190, 1-3), shampooing the body, sports, acceptance of gifts, sexual dalliance, devotion to another tirtha, prazsing another tirtha, the gift to others of clothes (worn by oneself), striking any one and swimming across the water of the tirtha, 

One noticeable rule is that, though Manu II. 149 requires strict examination of the ancestry and learning of brāhmadas to be invited at a śrāddha, some of the Puranas provide 1911 that

Tirtha brāhmanas to be preferred 

579 

one should not enter upon an examination of the worth of brahmanas at holy places and this view is endorsed by seve ral digests such as the Kalpataru on tīrtha (p. 10), the Tir. C. (p. 10) and the Tir. Pr. ( 73). The last work remarks that brāhmanas who are known for certain to possess defects deser ving condemnation should be avoided. The Varābapurāna goes1312 so far as to say that at Mathurā a pilgrim should prefer to honour a brāhmana born and bred up in Mathurā rather than a brahmana who has studied the four Vedas (but is a stranger to Mathurā). Similar passages from the Vayu and Skanda purāna have been quoted above in note 910 and there is another similar passage in Skanda, It is provided by the Vayupurana1313 that when a son goes to Gayā, he should invite only those brāhmanas that have been settled in Gaya by Brahmā and that such brāhmanas are above ordinary mortals, that when they are gratified the gods together with one's pitts become pleased, that one should not enter upon a consideration of their family, their character, their learning or their custorities and that when the Gayā brābmanas are honoured the man doing so secu res release (from samsāra). In Vāyu 106 73-84 and Agni 114, 33-39 and Garuda it is narrated that, after Gayāsura fell down and asked for boons which were granted by Vispu, Brahma bestowed upon the Gayā brāhmanas 55 villages and Gayātirtha extending over five krošas, gave them well-appointed houses, desire-yielding cows and trees, but he enjoined on them not to beg or aocept a gift from others. The brāhmanas, however, greedy as they were, officiated at a sacrifice performed by Dharna (Yama) and begged him for fees and accepted them, Then Brahmā cursed them that they would always be in debt and took away the Kamadhenu and Kalpavrksa and other gifts, The Agnipurāpa 1314 (114. 37) adds that Brahmā cursed them to be bereft of all learning and to be full of greed. The brāhmanas then begged Brahmā to favour them with some means of liveli. hood (as they had been deprived by the curse of Brahmā of all that had been bestowed on them), Brabnā pitied them and told them that they would maintain themselves at Gaya-tīrtha

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. till the end of the world and that those who would perform śrāddha at Gayā and worship them (by engaging them as officiating priests and pay them) would secure tho morit of having worshipped Brahmā From this it is clear that the Gayā brahmanas at the time of the composition of the section on Gaya at the end of the Vayupurāna possessed the same characteristics as the modern Gaya brāhmanas (Gayāls or Gayāwals as they are called) and made the Gayā pilgrimago their business even then (as now). One of the early historic references to Gayāl brāhmanas occurs in the Saktipur copper plate of king Laksmadasena of Bengal in his 6th year (i, e. about 1183 A D.) 1315, 

The result of this teaching of the Puranas was that thio brahmanas at Gayā became a guild or a close corporation and the Gayāwals resent the intrusion of an outsider. Disputes between Gayāwals and outside priests and cases of Gayānals have come before the courts and have gone up even to the Privy Council in England. It has been & usage for Orthodox Hindu pilgrims going to Gayā to share themse)ves at the river called Punpun, 1315a then on arrival at Gayā to worship the feet of one of the Gayāwal brahmanas. The Gayāval himself or his agent takes the pilgrim to the sacred spots (Vedis) in and around Gayā. The priest is paid a fat fee 110ar the Aksaya-vata and the Gayāwal puts a garland of flowers on the folded hands of the pilgrim and pronounces the word 'suphala' and utters a blessing that the pilgrim's ancostors would go to heaven on account of the pilgrim's visit to Gayā. In order to keep this business in their own families tho Gayāwals have adopted loose and peculiar customs. If a Gayāwal is sopless be makes a gift of his offico (called gūdı or gaddı) to another Gayāwal, who describes himself as the adontod son of the Gayāwa) making the gift. There is no real adoption in the strict sense. Therefore, the so called adopted son retaina his rights in the family of birth, he is not severed from his natural family and it is not rare to find that one Gayüwal claims to have succeeded to four gūdis (i. 8. claims to bo the son adopted by several persons simultaneously). The Gayasals have got books in which they enter the names and addresses of

their clients, who sign such entries and enjoin upon their des cendants to make members of that particular Gayāval family their gurus whenever they might visit Gaya. Thus large incomes and properties come to the hands of the Gavāwals. They send their agents throughout India, who bring as many pilgrims as possible. In Lachman Lal v. Kanhaya Lal the Privy 1316 Council had to deal with the case of a Gayāwal who claimed to be an adopted son without loss of his interest in the property of the natural family on the ground of these peculiar practices of the Gayāwals and that claim was upheld. In Lachman Lal v. Baldeo Lal 1317 the Patna High Court gives a brief summary of the origin, history and customs of the Gayāwals, remarks that though in former times there were several hundred families of Gayāwals their number is now reduced to about 150, that the Gayawals so-called gaddı is not a hereditary office, but only a business to which a good will is attached. The Calcutta High Court decided in Dwarka nath Misser 1318 v. Rampertab Misser that persons wbo require religious ceremonies to be performed for their benefit are at liberty to choose the priest by whom they shall be performed, that plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration that they along with defendants are exclusively entitled to officiate as priests when pilgrims, on their way to the holy city of Gaya, perform the śrāddha ceremony of their ancestors on the bank of the sacred river Punpun, and that the plaintiffs could be given a declaration that they are entitled to officiate as priests for such pilgrims as may choose to employ them for the pur pose of religious ceremonies and that the defendants are not entitled to prevent the plaintiffs from the exercise of their calling. In Narayan Lal 1319 v. Chulhan Lat the Calcutta High Court decided how the books containing the names and addresses of pilgrims kept by a joint family of Gayāwals were to be divided at the time of the partition of all the properties of the family.

In the Vanaparva (chap. 82–156) and Salyaparya (chap. 35-54) alone there are about 3900 verses on tirthayātrā. To mention only a few of the Purānas, the Brahinapurāna devotes about 6700 verses (i. e, nearly half of its total extent of 13783 verses) to tirthas, the Padma about 4000 verses out of the 31000 verses of the first five khandas, the Varāhapurāna deyotes about 3182 verses to tirthas (out of which about 1400 refer to Mathura) out of about 9614 verses, the Matsya about 1200 verses out of 14002. Besides these, the following well-known digests and works on tirthas deserve mention. The Tirthayiyecana-kāpda of the Kalpataru of Laksmidhara (G,0.8. series); the Caturvarga-1320 cintamani of Homādri (1260-1270 A D) contained a section on tirthas (20 Ms. has yet been discovered), the Tirthacintamani of Vācaspati (1450-1480 A. D.) published in B. I series, the Tirtha sāra, part of Nrsimhaprasāda about 1500 A. D. (published in the Sarasvatī-bhavana geries); the Tristhalīsetu of Nārāyanabhatta (about 1550-1580 A. D.) printed by the Anandāśrama Press, Poona; Tirthasaukhya, a part of Todarānanda (1565-1589 A.D.), Tirthatattva'or Tirthayātrāvidhitattva of Raghunandana whose Jiterary activity lies between 1520-1570 A D. (printed in Bengali characters and over and above the 28 tattvas of his Smrtitattva), Tirthaprakasa by Mitramiśra about 1610-1640 (published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series), the Tristha līsetusāra-sangraha of Bhattoji (about 1625); Tristhalisetusāra sangraha of Nāgesa, the Tirthendusekhara of Nageša or Nāgoji (published in the Sarasvatibhavana series, Benares, 1936 ). There are several works on tirthas (not yet printed) mentioned in H, of Dh, vol 1, p. 554, of which the Tirtharatnakara of Anantabhatta composed at the order of Anūpasimha is probably the largest work on tirthas (ms 10. 1822 in the Anup Library at Bikaner).

Then he should put on a pilgrim's dress as described above (p. 573), go round the village in which his house is located (or at least round his own house), reach another village not more distant than one Krosa (two or two and half miles) and break his fast by eating the remainder of the food cooked and ghee used for the Šraddha (this applies to pilgrimage to Gaya).

Then the next day he should bathe with pure clothes on and then put on his pilgrim dress and start on his pilgrim age in the forenoon with his face to the east, preferably bare-footed. There are two views here. Some say that on the day on which a man reaches a tirtha he should observe a fast, while the other view is that the pilgrim should fast on the day previous to his reaching the tirtha. In the first case he will have to perform a šrāddha on the day of the fast and in that case he cannot actually taste the remnants of śrāddha food but should only smell the cooked food The Kalpataru (on tirtha p 11) and the Tīrtha-cintāmani (p 14) quote Davala for the proposition that a fast on reaching a tirtha is not obligatory, but if observed yields special merit,

CHAPTER XII 

THE GANGES 

Since the Ganges is the holiest of rivers and since such highly esteemed tirthas as Kanakhala, Haridvāra, Prayāga and Kāśi are situated on it, it would be most proper to begin the treatment of individual tirthas with the Ganges, 

It has been already seen (p. 556) how the Ganges is the first among the many rivers invoked in the famous Nadistutz hymn (Rg X.75 5-6). In Rg 1323 VI 45 31 we have the word 'Gangyah' which most probably means 'growing on the Ganges'. In the Satapatha Brāhmana XIII, 5 4 11 and 13 and Ait Br. 39. 9 the victories and sacrifices of Bharata Daussanti on the Ganga and Yamunā are mentioned. In Sat. Br XIII.5 411 and 13 an ancient gūtha is quoted 'At Nādapit the Apsaras Sakuntala conceived Bharata who after conquering the whole earth brought to Indra more than 1000 horses meet for sacrifice.' The Mahābharata (Anušāsana 26. 26-103) and the Purāpas (such as Nāradīya. Uttarardha, chap 38-45 and 51. 1-18, Padma V. 60. 1-127, Agni chap 110, Matsya chap. 180-185, Padma, Adikhavda. chap 33-37) contain hundreds of verses eulogising the greatness and the sanctifying activity of the Ganges. The Skandapurāna, Kāsikhanda, chap 29 (verses 17-168) contains one thousand nimes of the Ganges. It is not possible to reproduce here even a small fraction of what is said in these works about the Ganges To most men in India great rivers like the Ganges great mountains like the Himalaya present & double aspect, viz the physical aspect and the spiritual aspect A great river apart from its volume of water is deemed to have a spiri tual or divine life which animates it. Tylor (in 'Primitive Culture, 2nd ed. p 477) observes 'What we call inanimate objects rivers, stones, trees, weapons and so forth-are treated as living intelligent beings, talked to, propitiated, punished for the harm they do,' There are separate treatises devoted to the glorifica tion of the Ganges and the pilgrimage to it such as the

The Vanaparra, chap 85, has a grand eulogy of Ganga in verses 88-97, some of which may be translated here 1324 "The Ganges is equal to Kuruksetra wherever one may take a bath in it, but there is a speciality about Kanakhala and in Prayāga there is the greatest and highest (holiness). If a person, after committing a hundred bad deeds, sprinkles him self with Gauges (water), the waters of the Ganges burn all of them as fire burns fuel. In the Krta age all (places ) were boly, in Tretā age Puşkara was the holiest place), in Drāpara Kuruksetta and in the Kali age the Ganges. The Ganges, when its name is uttered, purifies a sinner, when seen it yields good fortune, when a bath is taken in it or its water is drunk, it sanctifies the family up to the seventh ancestor, As long as (a particle of) the bones of a man touches Ganges Water (i, s lies inside it), so long does the man remain happy (or honoured) in heaven, There is no holy place equal to the Ganges, there is no god higher than Keśaya That country and that penance-grote where the Ganges flows should be known as the sacred spot of success (or perfection) since it attaches itself to the Ganges." The Anušāsana (26.26, 30-31) asserts 'those dis tricts and countries, those hermitages and mountains, in the midst of which the Ganges flows are pre-eminent in punya (religious merit) Even those men who, after committing sinful acts in the first part of their lives, resort afterwards to the Ganges reach the highest world (or goal). That increase (in merit) which comes to men that bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges and that then become pure in spirit, cannot be secured

In the Bhagavadgita (X.31) Lord Krsna says that among streams he is the Ganges (srotasāmasmi Jābnavi). The Manusmrti setting out an exordium to a witness to tell the truth indicates that the Ganges and Kuruksetra were the most sacred spots in the age of the Manusmrti.1326 Some of the Purānas describe the Ganges as flowing in Heaven (as Mandakini), on the earth (as Ganga.) and in the nether regions or Pātāla (as Bhogavati). Vide Padma VI. 267. 47. The Visnupurāna 1327 and other Parādas state that the Ganges springs from the toe-nail of the left foot of Visou. In some Purāpas it is said that Siva let off from his matted hair the Ganges in seven streams, three flowing towards the east (Nalini, Hladini, Pāvani), three to the west (Sita, Caksus and Sindhu) and Bhagirathi (vide Matsya 121. 38-41, Brahmanda IL 18 39-41, Padma I 3. 65-66). The Kurmapurana (1 46.30-31) and Varāba (chap. 82 in prose) state that the Ganges flows first in four different streams, Sita, Alakananda, Sucaksu and Bhadra and that the Alakagandā flows towards the south, comes to Bhāratavarsa and falls into the sea with seven mouths 1328 In the Brahmapurana (73. 68-69) the Ganges is described as sprung from the foot of Vispu and as established in the matted hair of Maheśvara (Śiva). 

The Vispupurāna eulogiseg 1329 the Ganges as follows: The Ganges purifies all beings from day to day when its name is

'1331 The Matsya, Kūrma, Garuda and Padna remark that the Ganges is easy of access everywhere but is difficult to reach at three places viz at Gangādvāra (Haridvāra), at Prayāga and where it joins the sea and that those who batho therein reach heaven and that those who die there are not born again The Nāradīyapurāna, on the other hand, says that tho Ganges is difficult of access everywhere, but much more so at three places The man, whether desiring it or not, who draus near the Ganges and dies (near it) secures heaven and does not see hell (Matsya 107.4),1332 The Kūrmapurāda represents that the Ganges 1333 is equal to all the 35 millions of holy places declared by Vayu in the heaven, in mid region and on the earth and that all of them are represented by the Ganges The Padmapurana asks 'what is the use of sacrifices rick in large wealth, what is the use of very difficult austerities when there is the Ganges honoured easily and gracefully that yields Heaven and moksa'?

Two verses of the Matsya-purana 1335 deserve mention here 'even a man of sinful deeds, on remembering the Ganges even , at a dis tance of thousands of yojanas, attains the highest goal. A person is delivered from sin by uttering the name (of the Ganges), on seeing it a person sees happiness; by bathing in the Ganges and drinking its water he purifies his family up to the seventh ancestor'. Tt is stated in the Kāśikhanda that on the banks of the glorious Ganges all times are auspicious as well as all countries, and all den are fit for receiving gifts 

___In the Varahapurana (chap. 82) the name 'Ganga.' is deri ved as 'gam gata.' (that has gone to the earth). The Padma purana (Srstikhanda 60.64-65) specifies the malamantra.about the Ganges as follows. 'Om namo Gangayai, visvarupinyai narayanyai namo namah'. 

The Padmapurana. (srsti 6035) holds that Visnu repre sents all the gods and the Ganges represents Vispu. It eulo gises the Ganges as follows: Sons abandon their fathers, wives their husbands, friends and relatives abandon a friend or a rela tive if any one of these is adulterous, or patita, or wicked or becomes a cāndāla or kills his guru, or is full of all kinds of sins and hatreds, but the Ganges does not forsake such persons 1336,

The limits of the ksetra are of the extent of one yojana between both the banks' i. e. the ksetra extends for two krosas from each bank. The general rule is stated by Yama that forests, mountains, holy rivers and tirthas are without an owner, these cannot be possessed (by a person as owner). The Brahmapurāna 1338 says that measur ing from the flowing waters for a distance of four hastas, God Nārāyana is the Lord (or owner) and no one should aocept a gift in that strip even if he be on the point of death. A differ ence is made between the garbha (the inner circle) of the Gangāksetra, the tira and the ksetra. 'Garbha' extends up to 1 that portion of the river stream which is reached on the 14th of the dark half of Bhadrapada; beyond that is the tira (bank), which extends upto 150 llastas from garbha and ksetra extends up to two krosas from each bank. 

Let us suppose that the pilgrim has come to the Ganges, Then the question is, how is he to proceed about a bath in the Ganges. Many of the digests contain several alternate forms of the sankalpa to be made at the time of Ganga-gnāna, For example, the Prāyaścittatattva (pp. 497-498) contains a very elaborate sankalpa A simple one is quoted below from the Gangāvākyāvali.1339 The mode of bathing prescribed in the

Procedure of bath in the Ganges 

591 

Matsyapurāna 102 is common to people of all varnas and students of all the different recensions of the Veda. The Matsyapurāna, chap. 10%, which contains one of the earliest procedure of a reli gious bath, and which has been taken over by several digests such as the Gangāvākyāvali (pp. 148–152) is summarised here, Cleanliness (of the body) and clean thoughts do not exist without a bath; therefore bathing is first prescribed for making the mind pure. One may bathe with water drawn (in a vessel from a well or stream) or with water not so drawn. A wise man should fix upon a holy spot after repeating the funda mental mantra 'namo Nārāyanāya' (reverent bow to Nārāyana). Aman holding darbha grass in his hand and being clean and pure should perform ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water). He should select a spot four hastas square on all sides and inpoko the Ganges (to come or be present there) with the following mantras 'you are sprung from the foot of Vigou, you are a devotee of Visnu, you worship Vispu; therefore save us from sins committed from birth to death. Vāgu declared that there are three and a half crores (35 millions) of holy places in heaven, on the earth and in mid air; all these, O Ganges (daughter of Jahou), belong to you. Your name among the gods is Nandini ( the joy-giving) and also Nalini and there are other names of yours viz. Daksā, Prthvi, Vibagā, Visva kāyā, Amartā, Sivā, Vidyādhari, Supraśāntā, Visva-prasādini, Ksemā, Jābnavī, Santa, Santipradayini, 13398 One should utter these holy names at the time of bathing; then the Ganges flowing in the three worlds would be near (even if a man bath ed at home). He should, after folding his hands, cast on his head thrice, four times, five times or seven times water on which he has muttered the mantras seven times. After having invoked the clay (in the river bed ) with the mantras 'O earth I Oh clay! you are crossed over by horses and chariots, by Visou, remove my sin which I may have committed by my evil deeds; you were brought up (from the depths of the sea ) by the Boar incarnation of Krsna with his hundred hands, O clayl you are given (to the Vorld) by Brahmā and you had mantras repeated over you by Kāśyapa, Occupying my Jimbs may you drive away all my sin!

Having thus bathed and having sipped water (acamana) according to the procedure prescribed, he should get out of the Ganges and should put on two white and pure garments. Then he should perform tarpana 1340 for the satisfaction of the three worlds. (He should say) 'This water is being offered by me for satiating gods, yaksas, nāgas, gandharyas, apsarases, asuras, cruel snakes, eagles, trees,' jackals, birds, creatures that sustain themselves on air and water or that move in the sky, all beings that are without support and those that are devoted to the dictates of dhar ma'.

He should devotedly satiate mon, the sages who were sons of Brahimā; he should say "May Sanaka, Sananda and Sanatana, Kapila, Āguri, Vodhu, Panoaśikha-may all these teach satiety by the water offered by me." Then he should satiate with water and akşata grains (the sages) Marici, Atri, Angiras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Pracetas, Vasistha, Bhrgu, Nārada; he should satiate all these devarsis, and brahmarsis, 1342 and rşıs with water and akşatas. Then wearing the sacred thread in the apasavya mode, bending his left knee on the ground, he satiates with water mixed with sesame and sandal-wood paste pitrs called Agnişvātta 1343, Saumya, Hayismat, Ūsmapa, Sukalin, Barhisad and others called Ājyapa.

Having thus bowed to the Sun and having circumambulated thrice { the lotus drawn for representing the sun) and touching a brāhmana, gold and a cow, the person (bather) should go to a temple of Visnu (or to his own house, according to another reading). 1344 

It may be noted that the verses of the Matsyapurana (102.2-31) summarised above occur (with slight variations of a word bere and there) in Padma (Pātāla-khanda 89. 12-42) and Sesti-khanda, chap. 20. 145-176. 

The Sm. O. and Raghunandana in his Prayaścittatattva (p. 502) lay down two mantras to be recited at the time of taking a bath in the Ganges 1345 'O Ganges, daughter of Jalinu! That flowest in three worlds, that art sprung from the lotus-like feet of Vispu, that are far-famed as devoted to (the spread of ) dharma, romove my sid; O divine mother, O Bhagirathi! purify with your immortal waters me who am full of faith and devotion. The mantra to be repeated at the time of the bath at the place where the Ganges falls into the ocean according to the same two works is "O god that art the lord of rivers: O goddess that art the best among rivers ! Having bathed at the confluence of both I shall cast off my ging" 

On pp. 243-244 above it has been stated that the Visnu Dh, S. and other works recommend the casting of the ashes or charred bones of a cremated body in the Ganges at Prayāga, Kasi or other holy place and the rites accompanying the cast ing of ashes have been there set out.

Casting ashes in the Ganges 

595 

ashes in the Ganges occurs in several works. The-Agaipurāņa observes the deceased man benefits if his bones are thrown into the Ganges; a man stays in heaven as long as (even a particle of) his bone remains in the waters of the Ganges. No rites for the dead are performed for those who commit suicide or who are patita; but even in their case the fall of their bones in Ganges water is beneficial to them.' The Tir, 

and Tir. Pr. quote two verses and a half from the Brahma purāpa 1347 which set out a briefer rite of throwing ashes than the one in the Nirnayasindhu. The verses mean: "The man carrying the ashes should take a bath, sprinkle pañcagavya over the ashes, should place on them a piece of gold, honey, ghee and sesame; then he sbould deposit them in an earthen Yessel; he should then look in the southern direction, say 'salutation to Dharma,' enter the waters (of the Ganges), utter, *may he (Dharma or Vispu?) be pleased with me and then cast the ashes in the water; then he should batke in the river, come out of it, cast a look at the Sun and then give a present (daksina) to a brāhmana; if he does so, then the state of the deceased person will be like Indra.' Vide Skanda, Kaši-khanda 30, 42-46 where a little more elaborate procedure is prescribed, The importance of casting ashes in the Ganges probably owes its origin to the story of king Sagara's sons who were reduced to ashes by the wrath of the sage Kapila and who were saved by the ashes being washed in the waters of the Ganges brought down from heaven by Bhagiratha. Vide Vanaparya chap. 107 109, Vispupurāna II. 8–10 for the story. The Nāradiya makes pot only the throwing of calcined bones a source of benefit to the departed but even his nails and hair when cast in the Ganges confer the same benefit. It is stated in the Kaśikhanda that those who, while standing on the banks of the Ganges, praise another tirtha or do not think very highly of the Ganges go to hell.1347a The Kasīkhanda further provides that there is special and

TRISTHALI 

The three great tirthas of Prayāga, Kasi and Gayā are referred to as Tristbali and the great scholar, Nārāyapabhatts (born in 1513 A D.), wrote (about 1580 4 D.) in Benares a famous work called Tristhalısetu (a bridge to the Tristhall) wherein he gives a thorough and exhaustive treatment of the pilgrimage to these three holy places 134&alone, Prayaga is assigned pp. 1–72, Kaśl pp. 72-316 and Gayā pp. 316-379 (of the Anandāśrama edition). Following with all humilits the footsteps of such an illustrious and venerable scholar I shall deal with the three tirthas in the same order. 

PRAYAGA One of the most ancient reference to the greatness of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā occurs in a khila 1393 Verse which is usually placed in Rg. 1 75 and may be rendered as follows: "Those who take a bath at the place there the

two rivers, white and dark, moet together, rise up (fly up) to Heaven; those determined men who abandon their body there (i. e. commit suicide by drowning themselves) secure immor tality (or molşa)". This must have been a comparatively early verse. The Skandapurāna referes to it as śruti. The greatness of Prayaga is dwelt upon in the Mahabharata (Vana parya 85. 69.97, 87. 18-20, Anušāsana 25. 36-38 ) 1350 and in many purānas such as the Matsya (chapters 103-112, in all 260 Verses), Kūrma I. 36-39 (verses 121), Padma (L. chap. 40-49), Skanda, Kāśi-Khanda, chap. 7. 45–65). Only a few out of the hundreds of verses on Prayaga can be cited here by way of sample. One remarkable fact is that the Rāmāyana does not say much about Prayaga. The confluence of the two rivers is no doubt referred to (Rām. II. 54.6) but from the des cription it appears that there was a forest at what is now Prayāga, Prayaga is called Tirtharāja (the prince among tirthas) in the Matsya 109. 15, Skanda (Kaśī 7,45), Padma VI. 23. 27-35 (where the refrain at the end of each verse is 'sa tirtharajo jayati prayāgah) and elsewhere. The legend runs that Prajapati or Pitamaha (Brahma) performed a sacrifice here and Prayaga is the middle one of the vedis of Brahmā, the others being Kuruksetra in the north (uttarayedi) and Gaya in the east. It is believed that three rivers meet at Prayāga viz, Gangā, Yamuna and Sarasvati (underground between the two). It is said in the Matsya 1351, Kūrma and other Purānas that at the very sight of Prayāga, even by taking its name or by applying its clay to one's body a man becomes free from sin. The Kürmapurāna 1352 proclaims “it is the sacred spot of Prajāpati; those who bathe here go to heaven and those who die here are not born again." That sacred spot is known as tirtharāja ; it is dear to Keśava The same is known as Triyon,

History of Dharmaśāsta 

(Vol. The word Prayāga is employed in the Deuter when connect ed with such words as tīrtha or ksetra, as in Matsya (111 14 prajāpater-idam ksetram prayāgam-iti višrutam), but when employed along with words (in the masculine gender) such as tirtharāja, it takes the masculina gender.. - 

The word Prayāga is derived in various ways. The Vana parva 1353 appears to suggest that the word'Prayage is derived from the root 'yay' when it says 'Brahmā who is the soul of all beings performed formerly a sacrifice hers; therefore it became known as Prayāga'. In the Skanda 1354 purāna also it appears to be explained by taking the two parts pra and vāga separate ly. "It is mentioned as Prayāga because it is superior to all sacrifices; Prayāga was the name given to it by the gods Hari, Hara and others seeing that it is superior to all sacrifices though the latter be enriched with fees and the like." The Matsyapurāpa 1355 appears to lay emphasis on the part 'pra' when it says 'on account of its efficacy (or power) as compared with all other tirthas it prevails (or is useful) far more'. The Brahmapurāna 1356 affirms "It is called prayāga on account of its eminence and it has the word 'rāja' (in Tirtharāja) applied to it on account of its being the chief". 

We must distinguish between Prayāga-mandala, Prayāga and Veui or Trivani, each subsequent ons being smaller and holier than eaoli preceding one. The Matsya 1357 states that the sphere of Prayāga is five yojanas in circumference and that the moment a man enters inside this strip of land, there is an Asya medha at every step. This has been explained by the Tristhalf setu (p. 15) as follows. Regarding Brahmayūpa (the sacrificial post of Bralmā) as the spike or peg, if one measures with a rope one and one half yojana long all round, that would be the

Boundaries and entent of Prayāga 

599 

Prayagamandala of five yojanas in circumference. The bound aries of Prayaga itself are defined by Vanaparva,1358 the Matsya purāna (104 5 and 106. 30) and others. 'Prayāga extends from Pratisthāna up to the pool of Vasuki and upto the two nagas Kambala and Asvatara and the nāga Bahumülaka; this is known in the three vorlds as the sacred spot of Prajāpati' (Matsya 104.5), while Matsya 106. 30 provides that to the east of the Ganges is the Samudrakūpa, which is the same as Prati sthāna. This is explained by the Tristhalisetu as follows. the eastern boundary is the küpa called Pratisthāna 1359, the nor thern one is the Vāsuki pool, the western limit is formed by Kambala and Aśvatara, the southern boundary is Bahumülaka. This would be a four-cornered space which is included within Prayaga-mandala. According to the Matsyapurāna as quoted by the Kalpataru on tirtha p. 143 the two Nāgas are on the south bank of Yamunā vhile the printed text has 'vipuje Yamunātate' (106 27 ) 1350 The printed text of Padma I 43. 27 supports the Kalpataru reading ('Yamunā-daksine tate) Vepi-ksetra is within the limits of Prayāga itself and is twenty bow ledgths in extent, as stated in the Padma, There are three kupas viz. Prajāga, Pratisthāna and Alarkapura. The Matsya and Agni say "there are three fire kundas and the Ganges flaws in their midst' It should be noted that except where special reference is made in the Purānas to the sub tirtlas, the reference to a bath at Prayāga in general means bath in the Veni i. e the confluence of the two rivers, as e. g in Vanaparva 85 81 and 85 and Matsya 104 16-17, 1361

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Yol. The Vanaparva 1362 and some of the Purados represent that the country between the Ganges and the Yamuna is (liko) the hips and loins of the earth (i e, it is the most prosperous and plentiful part of the earth) and that Prayaga is liko the inmost part of the hips. 

The Narasimha-purāpa says that Visou is in the form of Yogamūrti in Prayāga (65 17). It is said in the Matsya purana 1363 (111. 4-10) that when Rudra dissolves the world at the end of the Kaipa, the holy place of Prayaga is not destroyed, that Brahmā, Visnu and Maheśvara (Šiva) stay in Prayāga, that to the north of Pratisthāna Brahmā stays in it under guiso, that Visnu stays there as Vepi-Madhava, that Sira stays thero as the Vata (banyan tree) and that therefore the gods with the Gan dharvas, the Siddhas and great pages always protect the spherc (mandala) of Prayāga by guarding it against evil actions. The Matsyapurada, therefore, recommends that a pilgrim should go to Prayaga which is protected by all the gods, stay there for a month, avoid sexual intercourse, worship gods and pitrs and thereby secure his desired objects (104. 18). The same Purana highly eulogises the gift at Prayaga of a kapılū cow proporly decked (105. 16-22) with clothes, ornaments and powols. The Padmapurada (Adi 42 17-24) has the same verses as the Matera on this subject Similarly, the marriage of a daughtor in the @rosa form at Prayaga is highly spoken of in Matsya (106, 8-9). The Matsya (105. 13-14 and 106. 10) says generally that if a man makes a gift of a cow, of gold, of precious stonos, of poar): and of other things that he owns his pilgrimage becomes fruita ful (saphala) and lie collects religious merit (punya) and that when & man makes gifts accordiog to his ability ond wealth, the fruit of his pilgrimage increases and he remains in honvon till the end of the world. The Brahmanda 1364 assures pilgrims that whatever gifts are made according to one's ability at

Rewards of gifts at Prayāga Kuruksetra, Prayāga, at the mouth of the Ganges where it falls into the sea, on the Ganges, at Puskara, at Setubandha, at Gangadvāra and in Naimisa tends to confer inexhaustible rewards. In the Vanaparya 1365 it is stated that this sacrificial ground (of Brahma) is honoured even by the gods, that even a small thing donated here assumes greatness (i, e. produces the rewards of large gifts). 

The confluence of the three rivers came to be associated with omkāra, 1366 the mystic syllable that stands for Brahma. It is said in a purana passage (probably Brahmapurāna) that the three parts of om (a um) respectively are Sarasvati, Yamunā and Ganga and that the waters of three rivers represent Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarsana Hari. 

It may be noted that, in spite of the fact that the Matsya, Kūrma (I. 36-39), Padma (Ādi chapters 41-49), Agni 111 and other Puradas contain several hundred verses on Prayāga, the Kalpataru (on tīrtha), the earliest extant digest on tīrthas, quotes only the Matsya (104, 1-13 and 16-20, 105. 1-22, 106. 1-48, 107.2-21, 108. 3-5, 8-17 and 23-34, 109, 10-12, 110. 1-11, 111. 8-11, in all about 151 Verses) and Vanaparya chap. 85. 979-87 and 97 and does not add & single word of explanation or discussion, But the other digests profusely quoting mostly froin Purānas discuss at some length several topics and a few words must be devoted to some of those topics. 

One such topic is tonsure at Prayāga It is stated by the Gangāvākyāvali (p. 298) and the Tir Pr. (p. 335) that, though the author of the Kalpataru says nothing about tonsure at Prayāga, yet as ģistas (respectable and learned people) and the writers of digests accept it as necessary, certain autho rities would be set out. The two verses quoted by most 13664 writers are one should tonsure the head at Prayaga, offer pindas at Gayā, make gifts in Kuruksetra and should commit

Elaborate discussions are held by all these works about the exact inten tion of the verses, about the application of the maxim of rātrisattra 1367 to them and about the results derived from ton. sure. They have to be passed over here from considerations of space. The Tristhali-setu (p. 17) holds that the verse only prai ses the rite of tonsure at Prayaga and the fruit thereof is simply the removal of sin, The Tri. S. refutes (p. 17) the application of rāta 29atiramnyāya to these verses, while Tir. 0 (p. 32) applies it. Some of the conolusions drawn by the Tri S. are that in one and the same yātrā at Prayaga (even if a man stays there for some days) ceremonial tonsure takes place only once, that widows have to tonsure their heads, that in the case of women whose husbands are living only two or three finger-breadths of tresses are to be cut and offered at the Triveni, that even 13678 boys whose upanayana has not been performed have to undergo tonsure provided the cüdā rite has already been performed, The Tristhaligetu (p. 22) notes that certain traditionalista, 1365

Tonsure of women af Prayāga

relying on passages that arer that all sins oling to the roots of a person's hair, say that cutting two or three tresses would be merely hartanz and not zapana (tonsure), that even women whose husbands are alive must share themselves at Prayāga, that such women should make a braid of all their hair, should deck the braid with saffron and other auspicious materials, bow to their husbands and with the husband's permission have the head tonsured, that then they should place the cut hair in their joined hands, place thereon & golden or silver veni and pearls and coral and should cast all these into the confluence (Veni) of the Ganges and Jumnā after repeating the mantra 'May all my sins be destroyed by this offering of my braided hair into the Venii may my blessedness (the auspicious state of wifehood) 3] Ways increase in the lives to come' The Tri. S. states that romen do not tonsure their head at any tirtha except at Prayāga and the only reason for this is that it is the practice of śistas, Vide above pp 122-124 for tonsure as expiation for sins. The Nāradiya (Uttara) 63. 106 provides the same rule as Parāśara (in note 278 above) for women, The Prayascittatattva of Raghubandana prescribes the complete tonsure of the head for women at Prayāga. 

It appears probable that the provision for the casting of zenī (braided hair) on the part of women whose husbands were alive vas suggested by the word Teni applied to the confluence of the two rivers, where the river Ganges appears to make a bend or curre for some distance 1369 

One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieral Indian writers was whether and Then suicide, particularly at sacred spots like the confluence of the Ganges and Jumnā or at the foot of the Aksaya Vata at Prayaga, rould involve no sin.1379 This matter has already been

dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II pp 924-928 and vol. I, pp. 939, 948-949. Only a brief treatment by way of a summary of the pages and a few notes will be added here. The general sentiment of Dharmaśāstra works is to condemn suicide ar an attempt to commit suicide as a great sin (vide H of Dh vol I paga 924 for texts). The Āp. Dh. S. (1 10 28 15-17) mentions the view of Harita which condemns suicide even as prāya scitta for committing a mahāpātaka (like incest) and puts kill ing another or killing onoself on the same footing Manu V. 89 and Yaj. II. 154 condemn suicide by denying after-death rites to those who commit it, but Manu allowed suicide in various ways as prāyasoitta for mahāpatakas (vide Manu XI. 73, 90-91, 103-104). But exceptions to the condemnation of suicide are found in the startis, epics and purānas, They way he grouped under several heads. (1) Suicide as an exception in various ways by those guilty of mahāpātakas (viz. brahmana murder, drinking of suā, theft of brāhmana's gold and incest), vide H. of Dh. VOL II. pp. 924-925 for smrti and other texts, (2) Starting on the Great Journey (makāprasthana-ganana or maliāpathayātrā) by a forest hiermit (Manu VI, 31, Yaj. II, 55) suffering from incurable diseases and unable to perform tha duties of his order (3) An old nan or one who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or who is so ill as to be beyond medical skill may kill himself by throwing himself from a precipios or by fire or by drowning or fasting or start on the Great Journey into the Himalaya or by jumping from the bran ches of the Vata tree at Prayāga (Aparārka p 877 quoting Adi-purāna and Atri-smrti verses 218-219 q, by Medhātıthi on Manu V, 88 and Mit. on Yāj II. 6) (4) Even a house holder, otherwise all right, may resort to suicide by the means stated (in No. 3) if his life's work is dono, if he has no desire for the pleasures of the world and does not desire to live, or if he is & Vedāntin371 and coavinced of the ephemeral nature of life and may kill himself by fast in Himalaya. (5) Religious suicide was allowed at the confluence of the two great rivers Gangā and Yamunā, at the Vata there and at some other tirthas (6) A wife dying by sahagamana or anumarana. As to Sati, the Nāradiya (pürvārdha 7. 52-53) provides that a woman should not burn herself on the funeral pyre of her husband if she has a

young child or young children, if she is pregnant or if she has not attained puberty, or if she is in her monthly illness, at the time. Not only did common men believe in the pro mise of the Purānas that those who killed themselves at Prayaga (at the sangama or near Vata) secured moksa (freedom from the everlasting cycle of births and deaths) which was the highest of the four purusārathas (goals of human existence ), but even great poets like Kalidasa held the view that, though noksa or Tarralya or apavarga requires correct knowledge and realisation of the Supreme Spirit according to the Vedānta, Sānkhya and Nyāya systems, death at the sacred sangama led to moksa even without 'tattvajñāna.' In H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 925-927, historical ex amples of kings such as Yasah-karnadeva, Candella Dhangadev and Calukya Somešvara committing suicide at Prayāga or the Tungabhadrā have been given. The king Kumāragupta of Magadha is said to have entered the fire of dry cow-dung cakes. This is in accordance with the prescriptions in the Matsya purāpa 107. 9–10 (=Padma, Adi-khanda 44 3) which states 1372 'the man who, suffering from no diseases, having no deficiency as to his limbs and being in full possession of his five senges, encompasses (his death) in cowdung fire remains honoured in heaven for as many years as there are pores on the whole of his body.* 1373 The Rājatarangini VI. 14 refers to officers entrusted with the duty of supervising suicide by fast (prāyopaveśa).

[ Vol. The important verse on which reliance is placed for sanctioning religious suicide at Prayāga may be translated-1374 as follows. You shoujd not set aside (pass Over) your wish about dying at Prayāga on account of the words of the Veda or the words of the people.' The words of the Veda 375 are Vaj. 8,40 3(=Išāvāsyopanisad 3) which literally translated means "there are worlds of Asuras enveloped in blinding darkness, those who have killed themselves repair after deatlı to those worlds' This verse does not in the context appear to refer to 3 person committing suicide, but rather to a person who kills his soul by remaining in ignorance of the true Self. But even learned writers and posts took it to refer to suicide (vide Uttara rāmacarita, Act IV after verse 3). Another passage of the Veda on which reliance may be placed is the one in the Satapatha Brābmana X. 2. 6. 7 'one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass avay before the full extent of life, for at (such shortening of full life) does not make for the (heavenly) world' By the words of the people are meant smrti passages con demping suicide such as Gaut. 14, 12, Vag 13752 23. 14–15, Manu

IV) 

There is no doubt that some of the swirlis, the Maha bharata 1376 itself and somo purāpas do recommend (or at least do not condemn) suicide in certain circumstances. A few purāda passages may be quoted here. Two verses of the Kūrma state 'That goal (or state), which a wise man that is devoted to Yoga and that has become an, ascetic (or has forsaken all actions) reaches, is secured by him who gives up life at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā. Whoever dies in the Gangā whether wilfully or unintentionally is born after death in heaven and does not see hell', 1377 The Kürma is quite clear *Moksa may be secured or not after a thousand births else where but in Benares moksa can be secured in a zingle birth' (1. 32. 22) The Padma 1378 is quite emphatic a man who, knowingly or unknowingly, wilfully or unintentionally, dies in the Ganges secures on death heaven and molsa'. A verse of the Skanda asserts 'He who abandons his life in this sacred place in some way or other does not incur the sin af suicide but secures his desired objects.' The Kūrma (T. 38 3-12) refers to four modes of suicide and promises residence in heaven and Tarious other rewards for thousands of years, viz, by (1) burn ing oneself in the slow fire of dry cowdung cakes, (2) by enter ing the water at the confluence of Ganga and Yamuna, (3) by hanging with head down in the stream and feet up and drinking 

2376. Vide the references given under No. 2 and 3 of the five classes of cscusable or permitted suicides on p. 604 above. The Mahābbarata has a parva called Mahāprāsthānika in which it is garrated (cbap 1, 24) that Yudhisthira with his four brothers, qaeen Draupadi and a faithful dog started on the Great Journey towards the Himalaya and that they fell down dead one after another, Draupadi being the first and Bhima the last.

Hilory of Dharmasastra 

[ Vol. the wators of the Ganges, (4) by cutting off his own flesh and giving it ag food to birds. The famous Chinese traveller Hiquen Thgang (about 629-645 A. D.) clearly refers to this practica of religious suicide (vide Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Wes torn world,' vol. I. pp. 232–234). The Kalpataru on Tirtha (cotaposed about 1110-1120 An D.) devotes a special section to Mshapathayatra (pp. 258-265). Gradually, the idea of secur ing hoaven and moksa by committing suicide at Prayaga or Bonares appears to have spread to other tirthas. Vanapārya 1379 speaks of suicide at Prtbūdaka (Pebore in the Karna) district of Punjah, 14 miles from Thanesar) The Brahmapurāda 1380 calls upon dvijas who are intent on securing moksa to commit suicide at Purusottama-kšetra, The Lingapurada 1381 Bays 'lf a brahmapa kills himself on Srisaila be destroys his sins and attains moksa es at Avimusta (Benares); there is no doubt about this'. The Padma promises 1382 a similar reward for suicide by fire or by fast at the confluence of Narmadā and Kāferi (a small river, not the great South Indian river). 

Gradually there was a ropulsion of feeling against suicide at Prayāga or Kāšī or starting on the Great Journey. Among the actions forbidden in the Kali age are included 'starting on the Great Journey' and 'suicide of old people jumping from a precipice or by fire' (vide H, of Dh, vol. II, pp. 939, 958-59).

Both the Gangavakyavali (pp. 304-310) and the Tir.c (pp. 47-52) hold that all varnas have the authority to resort to suicide at Prayaga, The Tir. Pr holds a long, learned and highly polemic discussion on the subject of religious suicide at Prayaga (pp. 346-355), Its own view appears to be that a brāhmada should not commit this suicide at Prayāga on account of the prohibition contained in Kalivarjya verses and that members of the other varnas may do so. The Tristbalisetu also enters upon a long discussion (pp. 47-55) and its conclu sions are that in suicide at Prayāga for the attainment of moksa or other rewards (such as heaven) there is no sin, that this suicide at Prayaga is not forbidden 1384a to brahmanas as some think (since Agni 111 8 reads 'na vedavacanad vupma'), that persons whether seriously ill or in good health 1385 may resort to suicide at Prayāga, that no one has authority to commit suicide at Prayaga after abandoning to their fate one's old parents, young wife and children that require support, nor should a woman who is pregnant or who has young children or who has no permission from her husband, commit suicide at Prayaga.1386 It is refreshing to find Nārāyanabhatta, perhaps

[Vol. the most learned and renowned Pandit of his age steeped in all the lore of ancient India, make, in spite of the overwhelming weight of gastric authority in favour of suicide at Prayāga, exceptions that surely appeal to reason, gentiment and common sense, 1387 Nārāyapabhatta probably followed traditions several hundred years older than his times. Alberuni in his work on India composed about 1030 A D. says about religious suicide that "it was resorted to by those who are tired of life, who are distressed over some incurable disease, some irremovable bodily defect or old age or infirmity. This however no man of distinction does, but only vaiśyas and gūdras. Burning oneself is forbidden to brahmanas and ksatriyas by a special law, Therefore these if they want to kill themselves do so at the time of an eclipse in some other manner or they hīre somebody to drown them in the Ganges,' (tr. by Sachau, vol. I p 170). The Tri. S. S. provides that a man desirous of committing religious suicide at Prayaga should first perform a prāyaścitta,

should perform his own śrāddha upto the offering of pinda if he has no relative entitled to perform it, should fast that day, should make a sankalpa next day preceded by a writing (to inform people of his desire to die in that way) and enter the holy waters contemplating on Visou. On his death, his relatives have to observe āśauca only for three days (and not for ten) and on the 4th day the śrāddhas of the 11th day are to be performed for him.2388 

The psychological background behind the religious suicide at Prayaga and other places is not difficult to realise. Canturies of philosophical thought had made a very deep impression on the minds of all people that the soul has to subdiit to a never-ending cycle of births and deaths, Ancient scriptures had offered & release in two ways viz. by tattvagfiana and by suicide at a tirtha. Death had no great terror for the pilgrim who submitted to various inconveniences and priya tions ungrudgingly. If one is determined to put an end to sansüra by taking one's life, what nobler environment could have been imagined or indicated than at Prayaga, where two mighty rivers flowing from the sacred Himalaya unite and carry on unceasingly their work of fertilizing the land and bringing prosperity and solace to millions of needy and anxious people ? 

While on this topic of religious suicide, it would not be out of place to briefly refer to the discussion in the digests about the meaning of the statement in the puranas that those who die at Prayāgā are not born again (e.g. Matsya 180, 71 and 74). The answer is foreshadowed in the Matsyapurāna itself (18%, 22-25) which 2009 says: At the time of death, when the vital

[Vol. parts of the human body are being shattered, wemory must fail a human being that is about to be pushed on (to another body) by the vital breath (when it leaves the mortal coil). But at the time of death in Aviraukta (Vārānasi) Lord (Siva) himself Whispers (higher knowledge) in the ears of his devotees that are about to be pushed into new bodies) by (accumulations of their actions). À man dying Dear Mapikarnikā pool teaches the desired goal; he being guided by the Lord reaches the goal which is difficult of attainment by those whose minds are not pure.' In the Kāśikhanda it is expressly stated that moksa does not directly result in these cities (viz. Kāśī &c). But in spite of these warnings the popular belief fostered by the literal mean ing of hundreds of Purāpa passages is that moks& results from dying at Prayāga or in Kāśiksetra, 

The practice of religious suicide has a very respectable antiquity. In the 4th century B. C. Kalanos, the Indian Gymnosophist from Taxila who had accompanied Alexander from India, burnt himself alive on a fuperal pyre at Sousa, when being over 70 years old, he was aflicted with a malady that made life more and more burdensome. Vide J W McCrindle's 'Invasion of India by Alexander the Great' (Nov Edition 1896) pp. 46, 301, 386-392, Strabo inforps us of & gymnosophist from India named Zarmanochegas of Broach who accompanied an embassy to Augustus Caesar at Athens and consigned himself to flames (vide 'Invasion of India by Alexander' p. 389). Hiouen Thsang (Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Western World' vol. I, pp. 232-234) refers to suicide at Prayaga. The Jains, while on the one hand they laid the greatest emphasis on 'abimsa' (non-injury), encouraged reli gious suicide (called 'Sallekhana') in certain cases 1390. 

Some of the works, vix, tha Kaśkorti-moksa-vicāra of Sureśvara (pp. 2-9), tha Tristhalisetu (pp. 50-55) and the Tirthaprakāsa (pp. 313-318) discuss at some length how mere death (either involuntary or voluntary) in Vārānasi or Prayāga would lead to moksa Considerations of space prevent & complete stateinent of their views Their arguments are briefly as follows:--Karma is of three kinds, viz sancita (col

operate by giving the soul the present body) and hriyamūna (to be done in this body and in future). The Upanişads and the Gita 1391 declare that, just as waters do not stiok to a lotus leaf, so evil deeds do not cling to a man who knows this knowledge of brahma), that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all harma and that mioksa results from the realization of the Supreme Spirit (Vedanta-sutira IV. 1. 13). From this it follows that a man who has realized the Highest Reality will not be affected by the acts done by him after realiza tion and his accumulated actions (sancita) will be des. troyed by that realization. The present body in which the soul realizes brahina was due to that part of his karma which had begun to operate. When the present body perishes in the case of a man who has realized bralma he attains final release, since no actions remain for producing effects. To the man who dies a natural death in Benares is given at the time of death the Taraka (saving) mantra The Matsyapurana says:1392 those who enter fire according to the rules in Avimukta (i. 8. Benares) enter the mouth of Siva and so also those determined devotees of Siva who die by fast in Benares do not return (to this world) even after millions of halpas. Therefore all those who die in any way at 1393 Benares receive Grace from Siva after their death That leads to tattuajñāna (correct spiritual knowledge) which leads to moksa In rare passages it is espressly stated that mokşa cannot 1394 be immediately secured

(by dying) in these cities. The Tāraka-mantra is variously explained. According to Surešvara, Tāraka-mantra is the mystio syllable on which is a symbol of brahma as stated in the Tai. Up. (I. 1.8 Om-ti brahma) and the Gita (8. 13 Om ityekāksaram brahma). The Tri. S. gives another explanation besides this. According to Rāmatapaniya Upanisad and 1395 the Padmapurāpa the mantra is 'sri-Rama-Rama-Rāmeti.' 

There aro several sub-tirthas that fall under Prayāga The inost important of them is the famous Vata (banyan tree) called Aksaya-Vata (the imperishable Vata). The Agoi (111. 13) states 'if & man dies at the foot of the Vata and in the Sangama he goes to the city of Visnu'. Special reference is made to abandoning ono's lifo at the foot of the Vata. The Kürma1396 says 'He, who abandons life at the foot of the Vati, passes beyond heavenly worlds and goes to the world of Rudra'. The following are the sub tirthas of Prayaga and only references are given to the works in which they are described : (1) the two Nagas called Kambala and Aśvatara which according to some are on the spacious (vipula) bank of tlie Jumnā and according to others on the southern bank of the Jumna (Vanaparva 85 77, Matsya 106. 27, Padma, Adi 39 69, Agni 111. 5, Kūrma I. 37, 19), (2) Pratisthāna on the eastern side of tho Ganges, being the same as the Samudra-kūpa (Vana parva 85. 77, Matsya 106, 30, Kūrma I 37.22, Padma, Ādı. 43,30; Vanaparva 85. 114 appears to suggest that Pratisthana is another name of Prayāga; (3) Sapdhyāvata (Matsya 106. 43, Kūrma I. 37.28, Agni 111. 13); (4) Hamsaprapatana to the porth of Pratisthāna and to the east of the Ganges (Matsya 106. 32, Kūrma I. 37, 24, Agni 111. 10, Padma, Adi 39.80 and 43.32, (5) Kotitirtha (Matsya 106, 44, Kūrma I 37.29, Agni 111, 14, Padma, Adi 43, 44; (6) Bhogayati, the Vedi of Prajāpati to the north of Vasuki (Vanaparpa 85.77, Matsya 106.46, Agni 111. 5, Padma, Adi 39. 79 and 43,46; (7) Daśāśvamedhaka (Matsya 106.46, Padma, Adi 39.80); (8) Urvasipulina, suicide at which

The Purādas lay down that if a man starts on a pilgrim age, but dies on the way to Prayaga he reaps great benefits even without reaching it, provided he dies remembering Prayāga, The Matsyapurāna (105, 8-12) asserts : 1400 A. man whether in his own country or house or after leaving his country dies in a forest, while remembering Prayaga, he still secures the world of Brahma; he reaches a world where the

At most famous tīrthas the pilgrim has to perform śrāddha. The Visnu Dh, S.

Some of the works such as the Tristhalisetusārasangrala of Bhattoji provide that after performing a pārranaśrāddba at a tirtha and after making offerings of pindas to one's ancestors one should offer a single pinda to one's other relatives with the following mantra Here I offer pinda to deceased persons of my father's family, and of my mother's family and to the deceased relatives of my guru and of aiy father-in-law, to those men of my family

(Vāyu 110. 51-52). After this he should offer another pinda for his servants, slaves, friends, dependents, pupils, persons who conferred obligations on him, cattle, trees and those with whom he came in contact in other lives (Vāyu 110.54-55). If a person is ill or has not the time to go through this elaborate pro cedure, then he should make a sankalpa that he would perform śrāddha and should offer a single pinda with the mantra (in Vāyu 110 23–24) "I offer this pinda to my father, grand-father, great-grand-father, to my mother, father's mother, grandfather's mother, to my maternal grandfather and to the latter's father and grandfather.

The various views are the three days are the passage of the sun into Capricornus, Rathasaptami and the full moon day of Magba; the three consecutive days including the 10th of the bright half of Māgha, the first three days of Magha, the three consecutive days from the 13th day of the bright half of Māgba; any three days in Māgha,

CHAPTER XIII 

KAŠĪ 

There is hardly any city in the world that oan olain greater antiquity, greater continuity and greater popular Veneration than Banaras. Baparas has been a holy city for at least thirty centuries. No city in India arouses the religious emotions of Hindus as much as Kāśi does. To the Hindu mind it represents great and unbroken traditions of religious sanctity and learning. It is a miniature of Hindu life through the ages in all its great complexities and contradictions. Not only Hinduism with its numerous sects has flourished here for numberless centuries, but the principles of Buddhism, one of the great religions of the world, were first proclaimed here by Sākyanuni after he received Enlightenment at Bodh-Gayā under the Bodhi tree. Thousands of verses are found in the epios and purāpas about Banaras. Severa) volumes have been written about Banares during the last hundred years, 1465 It would be impossible to do justice here to this vast mass of literature on Banaras I shall briefly deal with the important topics relating to Banaras. In olden times the name was spelt as Benares, but recently as Banaras, which will be retained here (except in quotations). 

Before proceeding further, it is necessary to dwell, however briefly, on the ancient history of Banaras The Satapatha Br. quotes 1406 a Gathā which states that Satanika, son of Satrājit, carried away the sacred sacrificial horse of the Kāsis, as Bharata did in the case of the Satvats. In Sat. Br. XIV.3. 1. 22 king Dhrtarāstra Vicitravirya is called Kašye. In the Gopatha Br, we have 1407 the combination Kāši-Košalāh. The

Ancient 112story of Kūši 

Cambridge History of India (vol. I. p. 117 ) remarks that in the Brāhmana period Kāśi, the capital of the Kaśis, was situated on the Varadāvati. In the Br. Up. (II. 1. 1) and the Kausitaki 1408 Up. (IV. 1) there is the story of the proud Balaki Gārgya going to Ajātaśatru, king of Kāśi, with the assurance that the former would expound brahma to the latter. In Papini IV. 2. 116 Kāśi heads a gana (Kaśyādıbhyas-than-ithau'). Under Panini IV.2. 113 ve get the form 'Kāśiyah.' It is remarkable that in the Saryānukrama the rsi of Rg. X, 179.2 is stated to be Pratardana Kaširāja. In tarpana, the Hir. Gr. (II, 8, 19.6) mentions Kāśi śvara along with Visou and Rudraskanda (S. B. E, vol 30 p. 244). Divodāsa figures frequently in the Rgveda. In Rg I 130 7 Indra is said to have conquered ninety cities for Divadāsa, while in Rg. IV. 30.20 it is stated that Indra gave 100 cities of stone to Divoāāsa. From these Vedic references it may be surmised that in later works like the Epics and the Purāpas Diyodāsa vas naturally credited with the founding of the most sacred city in India. In the Mahābhāsya on Vartika 4 on Pan. IV.1.54 (vol II. p 223) we find the illustration 'Kasi-Kosalīyāh,' The Mahābhāsya (vo). IL P 413) furnishes the interesting information that there is a difference in the price of cloth manufactured at Kasi and that manufactured at Matburā, though the length and breadth of the piece of cloth be the same. This shows that even so early as the 2nd century B. C. Kāśi was famous for the fine qualities of its cloth, as now. 1409 From the above passages it is clear that Kaśī was the name of a country long before the Satapatha Br, was composed and it remained so till the 2nd century B.C. (the date of Patañjali). We have a parallel example. Avanti is the name of a country as shown by Pap IV.1.176 (striyām-avanti-kunti-kurubhyas-ca) and by the Meghadūta (Prāpyāvantin-udayane), but Avanti or Ayaptikā is also the name of Ujjayini (as in the well-known verse 'Ayodhyā... Avantika'). Fa Hien (399 to 413 A. D.) is said to have arrived at the city of Vārānasi in the kingdom of Kāģi (Legge's tr. p 94). This shows that about 400 A, D. Kāšī was still the name of the district and Vārānasi was its capital. But from the reference in the Mahābhāsya it appears that Kāsi had then become the name of the city (and was also

i voi, the name of the country) In the Agusāšana-parya (chap 30) it is said that Haryaśya, the grand-father of Dirodāsa, vas king of the Kāsis 1409a and was harassed and killed by the Vitabavyas in the Deab between the Ganges and Jumna. Haryaśva's son was Sudeva who was crowned king of Kası (verse 13, Kāśirajos bhyasinyata) and he also met the same fate as his father did. Then Dirodāsa, son of Sudeya, became king of the Kāśis and founded Vārāpasi thickly populated with men of all varnas on the northern bank of the Gomati. This legend shows that Kāšī was the ancient name of a kingdom and the ancient belief was that Vārāpagi was founded as the capital of the Kāśis by Divodāsa. In the Udyogaparta also Diyodāsa is said to be the ruler of Kāsis.1410 

The Harivamsa (I. chap. 29) has a long but rather confused story about Divodāsa and Vārāpasi 1411 It deals with the dynasty of Ayus, one of the sons of Aila. One of the descen dants of Āyus was Sunahotra who had three song, Kāša, Sala and Grtsamada From Kāģa arose a branch called Kāsayah. Dhanvantari, a descendant of Kāsa, was king of the Kašis (verse 22). Divodāsa was great-grandson of Dhanvantari. He killed 100 sons of Bhadraśranya, who first was Lord of Vārānasi, Then Siva sent his gana Nikumbha to destroy Vāradasi which had been occupied by Diyodāsa, Nykumbha cursed it to be devastated for a thousand years When it became devastated it came to be called Avimukta and Siva resided there it was again re-established (verse 68) by Dardama, a son of Bladrasredya, whom, because he was a child, Divodāsa had not killed Then Pratardana, son of Diyo dāsa, took it from Durdama Alarka, grandson of Divodāsa and king of Kāģis, again established Vārānasi This legend may contain some germs of truth, viz. that Vārānasi had become devastated several times and bad often changed hands. The Vayupurāna (chap. 92) and the Brahmapurana (chap. 11) also contain the same legends of Dhanvantari, Divodāsa, and Alarka and the vicissitudes of Vārānasi

In the Mahābhāsya Patanjali states (vol. I. p. 380,) that Vārānasi is alongside of Gangā and on Pan. IV, 3. 84 (vol. II. P. 313) he informs us that traders call Vārānasi Jitvari. 

Ancient Buddhist works show that Banaras was, in the times of Buddha (5th Century B O. at the latest), a great and famous city like Campā, Rājagrha, Srāvasti, Sāketa and Kaušāmabi (vide Mahāparinibbānasutta, S. B. E. vol. XI 2 99 and Mahāsudassanasutta, ibid. p. 247). The very fact that Buddha attained Enlightenment at Gayā (which was an out of the way place and on the borders, if at all, of Āryāvarta), thought it necessary to travel hundreds of miles from Gayā and preach his doctrines at Banaras in the Deer-park and set roll. ing the wheel of the kingdom of Dharma at that place, clearly indicates that Banaras had then become a very holy place and was in the centre of all Aryan activities and culture (vide S. B. E, vol. XI. p. 153 and vol. XIII p 90, Mahāvagga, S. B. E. vol. 17 p. 21). King Brahmadatta of Banaras figures in many Jātaka stories. Hardly any part of the jātaka tales can be placed earlier than the 3rd century B. O. But it may be admitted that Banaras was well-known as the capital of Brahmadatta kings several centuries before Christ. The Matsyapurāna 273, while enumerating hundreds of kings bearing the same surnames. states that there were 100 Brahmadattas and 100 Kāsis and Kušas 1412 But the very fact that Brahmadattas are separately mentioned from the Kāšis largely reduces the value of this piece of information. The ancient Jain works also speak of Banaras and Kāśi, In the Kalpasūtra it is said that Arhat Parsya was born in Banaras in the month of Caitra on the 4th day of the dark fortnight (S B. E. vol. XXII p. 271) and that when Mahavira died the 18 confederate kings of Kasi and Kosala along with other kings of the Licchavis and Mallakis instituted an illumination on the day of the New Moon (ibid, p. 266). Ašvaghoga appears to identify Vārānasi with Kaši when he says in his Buddhacarita 'Having entered Vārānasi. the Jina (Buddha) illumining the city with his light filled the minds of all the inhabitants of Kāšī with excessive interest."1413 The Buddhacarita further speaks of Buddha as having gone under the shadow of a tree near Vadārā (S, B, E, vol. 49 part 1 P.

In the Visnupurīna we have the story of Paupdraka Vasudeva who challenged Krsna and asked the latter to surren der his Calora and other symbols He was helped by the king of Kāśi, The combined armies of Paupdraka and Kāsirāja attacked Krspa who killed Paundraka and cut off Kāsiraja's head (with his discus) which fell in the city of Kašī. His son performed austerities, propitiated Sankara and secured from him a Krtyā (ogress) which entered Vārādasī. Krspa's discus in pursuit of her burnt the whole of Vārānasi together with its king, his servants and citizens In this account from the Vispupurāpa (V 34) the names Kāšī, Vārānasi and Ayimukta are employed as synonyms (verses 14, 21, 25, 30, 39). The same legend occurs in the same words in Brahmapurāna, chap 207 and is briefly referred to in Sabhāparva, chap. 14 18-20 and chap. 34. 11. 

From the above-mentioned accounts in the Epic and Purānas about Kāśi and Mahādeya, various conclusions 1414 have been drawn by writers, viz, that Mahadeva was a god of the pon Aryans, that Banaras was a centre of non-Aryan worship for a long time after the advent of the Aryans and that the people of Banaras, though they ultimately turned to the Aryan religion, were more interested in the philosophic speculations of the Upanisadic age. I dissent from most of these conclusions. We are on most unsafe ground as regards these conclusions. None of the extant Purānas can claim to be older than the 3rd or 4th century AD Most people in India lived and even now live a humdrum, placid and unattractive life in which there is nothing to satisfy the ordinary man's appetite for the mysteri oug, the unusual and the horrible. The purāpas contain stories that may be divided into several classes and that satisfied the above-mentioned cravings of the common man. Many of the 

1414. Vide, for example, Prof, AS Altekar's 'History of Bedares, pp 2-7. The Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 29''states that BaQBtat was at first the city of Madbava, but later on became a Saiva-ksetra, is there any real historical basis here? If any bistorical conclasion is to be drawn from this statement of the Nāradiyapurada it would be exactly, the opposite of what Prof. Altekar has drawn, V12, that the non-Aryans scored a cultural victory pyer the Aryaas at Badaras.623 

IT) Conclusions from legends about Banaras 

legends contained in the purānas were meant for the entertain ment of common people, just as even in these days millions in 

Western countries read with relish detective stories and crime club fiction, Some paurāņıc legends had a serious purpose in view viz emphasizing religious or philosophical dogma or moral values and standards and were clothed in a supernatural garb to make them striking and effective. Only a few legends have some historical basis, but the latter is evidently smothered in a mass of exaggerations and prejudices for or against a hero, or a caste, class, tribe or family. It is hardly fair to draw far reaching historical conclusions from heterogeneous materials in tihe purāpas about the conditions of things that prevailed several hundreds or thousands of years before they were compiled. The purānas often speak of the quarrels and bickerings abuong high gods and sages For example, the Vispupurāna V. 30.65 speaks of a fight between Indra and Krsna. Was Kropa a non Aryan god originally) Gapeša's left tooth was shattered by the missile of Parašurāma who comes to fight with Rāma, both being supposed to be avatāras of Visnu. The sage Burgu curses Visnu, Gautama curses Indra, Māndavya curses Dharma (vide for all these, Brahmānda II, 27. 21-25). 

In several purānas Kāšī or Vārānasi has been lauded and described at great lengtli. Vide Matsya 180-185 ( 411 verses), Kūrma 1.31-35 (verses 226 ), Lingapurāna (pūrvabhāga, chap. 92, verses 190 ), Padma (Adikhanda 33-37, verses 170), Agni 112, Skanda, Kāśikhanda, chap 6 ff, Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 48-51). The Kašīkbanda alone has about 15000 verses1415 on Banaras and its sub-tīrthas. In the Padmapurāna the sages are said to have asked Bhrgu five questions, viz what is the greatness of Kāsi, how it is to be understood, who should resort to it, what is its extent (or boundaries) and by what means it (Kāģi) can be secured. In the Skandapurada, 

1415. Dr. Fitz-Edward Hall (Introduction to Sberring's work P. XXXII a. 3) criticizes Dr Wilson for holdiog that the greater part of the kasih banda is anterior to the first attack on Banaras by Mahmud of Gazoi and holds that it is later than the Gazdivide invader Dr. Hall advances Hardly any convenciog reasons The work of Alberuni is definite that Sultan Niahnud of Gazni had not spread his depredatiods as far as Badaras (vide Sachau, vol. 1 p. 22) “This is the reason why Hindu Sciences have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Bedares and other places 'The Kalpatatu on Tirtaa quotes about one hundred verses og Varanasi

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. Kāśikhanda 1416 (chap. 26.2-5) the following questions are asked, viz. from what time this holy place Avimukta became highly famous, how it received the nams Avimukta, how it became the way to moksa, how the pool of Manikarnikā became an object of worship to the three worlds, what was there formerly (when) the Ganges was not there, how it came to be called Vārānasi, Kašī, Rudrāvāsa, how it came to be Ananda kānana (the forest of bliss ) and then Avimukta and Mahāśmaśāna ( the great cemetery ). 

Banaras has been known for centurios under five different names viz. Vārānası, Kāsi, Avimukta, Āvandakānana and Śnasana or Mahasmaśāna. The Kāśikhanda states that Sankara first called it Anandakınana and then Avimukta, 1417 

(Continned from the last page) from the Skandapurana and holds the latter work to be as authoritative as the Matsyapurana, Lingapurana and other Puranas The Kalpataru of Lakshmi dhara was composed about 1110 A D. (vide Prol Aiyangar's Introduction to Tirthakānda pp XVIII-XIX). Therefore a century or two at least before 1100 A D. there existed a Skandapurana, part of which contained a culogium of Banaras. Unfortunately the present priated Kāsil banda of the Shanda does not agree with the quotations from the Skanda given by the Kalpataru. A curious state of tbings is divulged as regards the quotations from Skanda in the Kalpataru. For example, on pp 36–37 of the Kalpataru on Tirtha, about 19 verses are quoted from Skanda which occur verbatim ip the Lingapurana, chap. 92. 120-142 (with the addition of some half verses) Similarly, od 

44 of tbe Kalpataru three verses are quoted from Skanda, wbich are the same as Linga. 92 87-89 On p 42 Kalpataru quotes one verse about Goprekseśvara from Shanda wbicb is quoted from the Lingapurana by Tr S. 

171. Some of the Puranas say that the Skanda has 81101 verses (Matsya 53, 42-43) But the Skanda printed at the Venkateśvara press contains several thousand verses more It appears that there were different recens ions of the Skanda. The Trı S. quotes verses from speciāc cbapters of the Kāsik banda which are generally found in the printed work. Vide p 193 (for chap. 30), 190 (for chap. 32), p. 144 (for chap, 34). p 160 for chap 45, p. 154 for chap. 49, pp 157 and 200 for chap 61 etc

The derivation of the word Kāść The derivation 

625 

A few words must be said about the derivation and significanos of these words as gathered from the Puranas and other works. And first comes Kāśi. It is derived from the root kas to shina.' The Skandapurāpa 1418 says that the city of Kāšī became famous by that name because it sheds light on the way to) niryāna (final release) or because that indescribable refulgence, viz. God Siva shines forth there. The name Vārānasi is derived in several Purānas from the names of two streams Varanā 1419 (modern Bārnā) and Asi, which are respectively the northern and southern boundaries of the modern city. From the passages quoted below from the Skandapurana (Kasi-khanda) it appears that Asi 18 the correct form of the name of the river, The names most frequently used in the Puranas are Varānasī and AvImukta. In the Jabalopanisad 1420 the words Avimukta, Varada and Nāsi are brought together in an esoteric sense. "Atri asked Yājñavalkya: how is one to know the unmanifested Self? Yajāavalkya explained that he was to be worshipped in Avimukta, since the self is centered in Avimukta. Then & question was asked: in what is Avimukta centered or established? The reply is that Avimukta is established in the midst of Varadā and Nāsi. Varanā is so called because it

wards off all faults due to the senses and Nāsi destross all sins due to the senses. Then a question is asked. that is its loca tion (sthāna )? The reply is that it is the conjunction of the eyebrows and the nose i. e, the upāsanā (contemplation) of Avimukta is to be made as located in the span betsoon the eyebrows and the root of the nose," Here it will be seen that Varapā and Nāsi are the names and not Varana and Asi). The Vamanapurāna employs the form Asi (15.50-53). Tho same is the case with the Padma. 

The name Avimukta has generally been explained as derived from the negative particle 'na' (for which 'a'is substi tuted) and vimukta (forsaken). Many Purānas say that tho holy place is so called because it was never forsaken by Siya (some times both Siva and his consort) 1421 In the Lingapurāna another derivation is suggested 1422 "avi means 'sin'; that holy place is devoid of sin". The Kāśikhanda (39.74 ) states that originally the ksetra was called Anandakānann and then Avimukta because though Siva went to stay on Mandara mountain he did not leave it entirely but left his lingu thore 

Vārānagl is very dear to Siva, it gives him joy and there fore it is called Anandavana or Anandakānana, 1423 It is also styled Smaśāna or Mahāśmaśāna for various reasons As a belief was entertained by all people that death in Banaras frood a man from samsāra, and as the thoughts and aspirations of pious Hindus ran in the direction of dying on the sacrod soil of Banaras, the old and decrepit crowded theroin and persong seriously ill got themselves removed or wors removed to tho banks of the Ganges when about to die and pero cremated thera Cremation of corpses is always seen on tho Manikarniki ghūt near the Ganges.

The Skanda says. 1424 * sma.' means a corpse and 'sana ' means 'lying down '; when the end of the world comes, the great elements lie here as corpses and therefore this place is called Mahasmasana." The Padmapurana 1425 makes Siva say. Avi mukta is a famous cemetery becoming the Destroyer (or the Time Spirit) I being here destroy the vorld'. Matsya very frequently speaks of Vārānasi as Smaśāna, The Kāsīkbanda states: if a man after reaching the great cemetery dies there by fate he has never again to lie in the cemetery (i. e. he is not born again). 

Although generally Kāśi, Vārānasi and Avimukta are used as synonyms in the Purānas, in some passages a distinction is made between these as to extent. The passages quoted above (in note 1419) show that Varanasi is bounded by the Varana and Asi on the north and south,1426 the Ganges on the east and the shrine of Vinayaka in the west, Ain. A. (vol II p. 158) remarks that Benares is a large city situated between the rivers Barnā and Asi and that it is built in the form of a bow of which the Ganges forms the string. The Matsyapurāna 1427 states : 'that ksetra is two yoganas and a half east and west and half a yojana broad north and south; out of this Vārānasi extends up to the dry river (viz. Asi)'. The first part appears to deal with the entire Kāšīksetra which according to the Padmapurāna 1428 comprised the tract covered by a circle the radius of which was the line joining Madhyameśvara-linga

The Matsyapurana (in chap. 183.61-62 ) makes it two yojanas in extent Agui 112 6 also does the same But that is only approximate The actual distance covered by a yojana varied Vide H. of Dh Fol III pp. 145-146 n. 185 Rhys Davids in 'Numismata Orientalia' (London, 1877) after examining 30 passages from Pālı texts comes to the conclusion that a yojana was equal to about 7 or 8 miles Avinukta is said to be that part of the boly place which is represented by a radīus of 200 dhanus (1 e. 800 hastas or about 1200 feet) in all four directions from the sbrine of Visvešvara, 1429 There was no unanimity on the extent of Avimukta. In Kāśikhanda Avimukta 1429a is said to be fire kosas in extent But there Avimukta appears to stand for 

Kaii. The Innermost 1430 circle in the holy Kasiksetra is defined as that between Gokarpesvara to the west, the mid stream of the Ganges to the east, Bhārabbūta to the north and Brahmeśvara to the south. A few more passages on the extent of the sacred place of Banaras may be cited here in one place. The Lingapurāna1431 says 'this ksetra is declared to be four Irosas (in extent ) in the four directions and also one yojana', The Naradiyapurana 1432 puts the extent thus (The ksetra) extends over two yojanas and a half from east to west and 19 half a yojana wide from north to south, god Sambhu declared the extent of the ksetra between the rivers Varunā and Asi (which latter is) a dried-up stream ' In the Padmapurana 1033

Ertent of Kasi in medieval works 

Brahmā is supposed to have said to Rudra 'I have given you a ksetra of the extent of five krošas; when the best of rivers. Gangā, will flow through this ksetra, the city will be great and holy, the Ganges, as it flows northwards (in Banaras) for two yojanas, will be holy'. If in any texts there be any differences between the extents of Arimukta, it must be supposed that there is an option,1434 (or, as the Tir. C. suggests, the differences refer to different talpas i, e, ages). It is clear that Vārānasi was that strip of land, the four boundaries of which were the Ganges to the east, Asi to the south, the shrine of Dehali Vinayaka to the west and the river Varanā to the north. In the 7th century Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese pilgiim, notes that Banaras was 18las (about 33 miles) in length and about 5 or 6 lis ( a little more than a mile) in breadth. This makes it clear that the city was then bounded as now by the Varapa and Asi. 

Vide Beal's B R. W. W (vol II p. 44). 

Verses laudatory of the greatness and uniqueness of Vārānasi literally run into thousands. All that can be done here is to set out a few characteristic verses. The Vanaparva observes, 1435 a person coming to Apimukta and resorting to the sacred place becomes free from the sin of brāhmana-murder by 

merely seeing the (image of the) Lord of gods (i e. Visvesyara) and if he dies there he secures moksa. The Matsyapurana 1436 contains many striking passages about the unique greatness of Banaras "Vārānasi is always my most secret place; it is always the cause of moksa for all beings. Moksa may be effected in Prayāga or in this city because I have taken it under my protection, this place is greater than even Prayaga, the forea most among tirthas. All the sins 1437 that a man may have

A person, 1438 even though his mind may be addicted to pleasures of sense and though he may have given up devotion to dharma, if he dies in this place (Banaras) he does not again enter upon the path of samsara (the cycle of births and deaths); a man concentrating his mind for thousands of past lives may secure Yoga; but by dying (in Banaras) he secures the highest moksa in this very life. Even if a man be a sinner 1439 or a rogue or irreligious he becomes free from all sins if he goes to Avimukta Other women,1440 that act as they like and are intently devoted to enjoyments, when they die here by lapse of time secure the highest worlds.

ingly all those are reduced to ashes when he enters Avimukta. Even a mleccha resident in Kāšī is better, since his future will be blissful, but not one residing elsewhere, though he may be a dikşita, because he will not be a recipient of mukti." 

Iu sone passages a mystic flayour is imparted to Vārāpasi and the rivers. For example, the Kāśīkhanda says that Asi is the Ida Dādi, Varaṇā is the Pingalā nādi, Avimukta is susumnā and Vārānasî is all the three.144 The Lingapurāna, however, puts the matter somewhat differently. It holds that Asi (the dried-up river), Varana and Matsyodarī (i.e. Ganges) are respectively the Pingalā, idā and Susumnā, 

It is time now to turn to the individual sacred spots in Banaras. It is stated in some of the Purānas 1445 that at every step in the Kāśīksetra there is a holy place and that there is not eren as much space as a sesamum seed in Kaśī which has not a linga (emblem of Sira). As a matter of fact the Kāśikhanda names 64 lingas in chap. 10 alone. But one must look to the tirthas that are specifically named. Hiouen Thsang says that there were one hundred temples at Banaras in his day and he speaks of a temple where the copper image of Dera Mabesvara was a little less than 100 feet high (vide Beal's B R. W. W. rol. Il. pp. 44-45). Unfortunately, the fanatical zeal and ruth. lessness of Moslem rulers demolished almost all Hindu temples at different times from 1194 to about 1670 A, D, Mosques and mausoleums were erected on their sites, and the materials of the temples thus razed vera used in constructing mosques and for serving as breaksvaters &c, Kutubdin Aibak destroyed about 1000 temples in 1194 A, D (vide Elliot and Dowson's 

History of India', vol. II p. 222) Alauddin Khilzi boasted that he had destroyed one thousand temples in Banaras alone (vide Sherring p. 31, Havell p. 76). About 1585 A, D, Nārāyada. bhatta re-established the temple of Visvanatha vith the help

[Vol. of Raja Todarmal 1446. Even this temple was desecrated. The following passage from the Ma-A'sit-i-A'lamgiri quoted by Elliot and Dowson ("History of India,' vol. VII, P 184) is in structive: "It reached the ears of his Majesty, the protector of the faith, that in the provinces of Thatta, Multan and Benares, but especially in the latter foolislı brahmanas were in the habit of expounding frivolous books in their schools and that students and learners, Musalmans as well as Hindus, went there even from long distances, led by a desire to become acquainted with the wicked sciences they taught. "The Direc tor of the Faith' consequently issued orders to all the gover nors of provinces to destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels, and they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practising of idolatrous forms of vorship On the 15th Rabiu-akhir (i, e. December 1669) it was reported to his religious Majesty, leader of the Unitarians, that in obedience to order, the Government officers had destroyed the temple of Bishnath at Benares," 

A mosque, which still existe, was built on the site of tha Višveśvara temple by Aurangzeb, who even changed the name of Banaras to Muhammadabad. The result is that, as stated by Sherring (p. 32), it would be difficult to find twenty temples in the whole of Banaras of the age of Aurangzeb (1658-1707 A. D.). Many of the tomples were built by the Maratha Chiefs and Sarxlars and during the British ocoupation many more were built. Prinsep calculated in about 1828 that there were in the Banaras city proper 1000 Hindu temples and 333 mog ques; a more recent estimate puts the figures at 1454 temples and 27% mosques (Sherring 1447 pp 41-42). 

Visyesvara or Visvanātha is the tutelary deity of Banaras and the principal and most holy temple in it (vide n 1429 a) It is prescribed that every resident of Kāśi nust every day bathe in the Ganges and visit the temple of Visveśvara (vide Tri S p. 214). After Aurangzeb pulled down the temple of VIŠva. nātha, there was no shrine of Visvanātha in Benares for over a hundred years The lenga was probably removed from place

to place as the vicissitudes of the times required and the pil grims performed parts of the worship (such as nantaskara and circumambulation) at the site of the image, but they could not perform other portions of the worship such as bathing the image with Gadges water 1448 The present temple of Viśvanātha was built in the last quarter of the 18th century by Devī Akalyābar Holkar (Altekar, p. 57). The Tri. S. p. 183, while on the question of the appearance (prādurbhāva) of Viśveśvara, observes that there is no blemish in the case of the Visvešvara lipga due to the touch of the untouchable, that every day Višreśvara removes it by a bath in Manikarnikā at dawn and the worship offered by Himself and quotes a verse of the Sanat kumāra-sainbita in support 1449 What the Tri. S. means is : Generally great care is taken about lingas. All and sundry are not allowed to touch them but in the case of the Vište śvara-linga any one, even a great sinner, may worship it and pour Ganges water over it. Whether Nārāyanabbatta neant that even the so-called untouchables might touch it is not clear. 

It appears that Vācaspati 1449a holds that Avimukteśvara lipga is the same as Visvanatha, but both the Tristhalı-setu (296) and Tīr. Pr. (p. 187) reject this idea.

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. Kesava, Bindumadhava and Manikarnika,151 In modern Times the five essential tirthas called Panoatirthi are the confluence of the Asi with the Ganges, the Dašāśyamedha ghat, Madi. karnikā, the Pañcagangā glāt and the confluence of the river Varana (valled Barna by the common people) with the Ganges. This is based on the Kašīkhanda,1452 The shrine of Lojārka is situated at the confluence of the Asi (the southern boundary of Banaras) with the Ganges. The Kašikhanda 1453 furnishes a popular etymology for the name Lolārka, viz. that the mind of the Sun on seeing Kasi became agitated. The Asi is a tolerably wide stream (about 40 feet) in the rainy season, but is dry at other times. The several gigantic ghats with their flights of stone steps are a grand sight at Banaras. The Ganges while passing by Banaras takes a great sweep so that its mighty current flows in a northerly direction that is towards the Himalaya) and is therefore held to be peculiarly holy hera, The Daśāśvamedha-ghāt has been famed for centuries, Jayaswal's interpretation of the epithets applied to the Bhara śivas in Vākātaka grants should be accepted viz, the Bhārasivas were an imperial dynasty, were crowned with the holy waters of the Ganges and took their ceremonial baths on the Ganges at the end of ten Ašvamedha sacrifices, on account of which the Dasasvamedha-ghat 1454 at Banaras was so named (Jayaswal's 'History of India' 150 A.D.-350A.D p. 5). In order to realize the grandeur of Banaras on the side of the river one must be at

the Daśāśvamedhaghāt at dawn. For the eulogy of Daśāśva medha, vide Kāśikhanda 52. 83 ff and Tri. S, p. 159. The Kāśikhanda says that formerly the tirtha was called Rudrasaras, but as Brahmā performed ten Aśramedhas there it came to be called Daśāśvamedha (chap 52. 66-68). The Manikarpikā (also called Mukti-ksetra) pool is the very centre of the religious life of Banaras and 1455 is the most holy among all the Banaras tīrthas. The Kāšīkhanda gives a phantastic story of its origin (in chapter 26 verses 51-63 quoted in Tri. S. pp. 145-146): Visou dug with his discus a puskarini, filled it with the perspiration from his own body and performed severe austerities on its bank for 1050 (or 50000) years, Siva came there and being pleased shook his head and an ear-ornament studded with jewels fejl into the pool, which thenceforward came to be called Mani. karnikā, The word is 1456 derived in two ways in the Kāśī. khanda. Siva who is like the wish-yielding jewel whispers in the ear (karpikā) of good men the Tāraka mantra at the time of death. The extent of Manikarnikā north to south is said to be 105 hastas i e, about 160 feet (Kāśikhanda 99.54). In modern times the waters of the Manikarnikā pool become foul and fetid because it is shallow (two or three feet deep), because hundreds of pilgrims cast into it flowers and money by way of worship and because the priests stir the vaters with tñeir hands and feet to find the coins dropped by pilgrims. Our methods of worship must be changed The flowers and gifts should be placed on the banks of the pool and then taken away by the priests. The Tri S. p. 147 mentions several mantras (two of which are set out below) to be recited when contemplating on Madikardikā, 1957. Near the Mani. kard Ikā pool is the temple of Tārakešvara so named from the belief that Siva will whisper the mantra called taraka in the ear of

Voi. the dying man brought to the sacred pool1457a (vide Kašikhanda 7.78, 25, 72-73 and 32. 115–116). The Pañcagangā ghāt 18 so called because it is supposed that five rivers, viz the Kıranā,1458 Dhūtapāpā, Gangā, Yamunā and Sarasvati, meet here (though four of them are invisible) This is very highly eulogised and it is said in the Nāradīyapurāna and the Kāšīkkapda (59, 118-133) that when a man takes a bath in the Pañcanada he is not born again in a body made up of the five elements. It is said that this confluence of five rivers had different names viz. Dhariyanada, Dhūtapataka, Bindutirtha and Pañcanada in Krta and the following Yugas respectively The Kāśikhanda in chap. 59 deals with the confluence of five rivers and gives phantastic legends as to why the rivers were called Kiropā (59. 108–113) and Dhūtapāpā (59 101-106). The river Varanā is the northern boundary of Vārānasi and the end of the ghāts on tlio northern side is reached at the confluence of the Varana with the Ganges. That the ghāts have been there for at least a thousand years can be proved from copperplates and inscrip tions. The Gāladvāla rulers of Kanoj (of whose times at least 55 copperplates and 3 inscriptions on stone were issued during the period 1097 to 1187 A. D), being devotees of Vispu, several times made grants at the Adi-Kaśava ghāt.

and Varanā bestowed on 500 brāhmanas 30 villages on the Aksayya-trtiyā of samvat 1156). Those rulers made grants at other ghāts and sacred spots also For example, E. I vol.

The Kāśi-khanda promises Varupa-loka to those charitable people that build stone ghāts on the sacred rivers 1460 · 

One of the most meritorious of all pilgrimages is the Pañcakroši by road. Laksmīdhara in his section on Tirthas in the Krtyakalpataru apparently takes no notice of it. The length of the Pancakrosi road is about 50 miles and there are hundreds of shrines on the road Taking Mapikarpıkā as the centre the whole road describes an irregular semicircle round the city of Banaras with a radius of five krošas (about ten miles) and hence it is called pancakrosi. The word 'pañcakrosi' ocorre very often in the Kašikhanda (as in chap 26, verses 80 and 114 chap 55 44). This pilgrimage may be very briefly described as follows:-The pilgrim starts from the Manikarnikā-ghāt and going along the bank of the Ganges arrives at the confluence of the river Asi with the Ganges and balts for the day at a village called Khāndava about six miles from Madikarpikā. The 2nd day's march (for eight or ten miles) ends at the village called Dhūpacapdi where he offers worship to the goddess of that name. On the 3rd day the pilgrim walks 14 miles to the village Ramešvara. On the 4th day he walks eight miles and reaches the village Sivapura. On the 5th day he walks 6 miles and reaches the village Kapiladhārā, where the pilgrim offers oblations to his pitrs On the 6th day he walks from Kapila. dhārā to Varanāsangama and thence to Manikarnikā, a diga tance of six miles It is the practice for pilgrims to scatter grains of barley from Kapiladbārā to Manikarnikā, The pil. grim batbes, pays dakşınā to the priest and then goes to the temple of Sāksi-Vināyaka who is supposed to bear witness to the pilgrim's having performed the Pancakrosi-yātrā,

There are numerous other sub-tirthas in Banaras, some of which may be briefly noticed here. The Jñānavāpi may be mentioned first. The story of its origin is narrated in the Kāśikhanda, chap. 33. The Tri. S (pp. 148–150) refers to it, It is said that when Siva (Isana) saw the Viśyeśvara-linga a desire arose in him to bathe with its cool water. He dug & kunda with his trident to the south of the temple of VišvešYAT& and with the water therefrom he bathed Viśyeśvara-linga and Visvešvara granted the boon that the tirtha would be superior to all tirtbas and that, as Siva is knowledge (verge 32), the tirtha would be called Jñanoda or Jūānavāpi. One of the most popular and the most frequented temple is that of Durga. In chap. 72 (verses 37-65) of the Kāśikhanda there is a Durgāstotra called Vara-panjara which is referred to in Tri. S. p. 161. There is a temple of Bhairayanātha about a mile to the north of the temple of Visvešvara. He is the Kotwal or police Magistrate of Kāģi and wields a stone cudgel (of enormous thickness). His vāhana is a dog. Vide Kaśikhanda, chap. 30, for Bhairava, There are many temples of Ganeša The Tri, S. (pp. 198–199) Dames 56 Ganesas and indicates their locations, following Kāśikhanda, chap 57 59-115 (sat-pancāsad-Gaja mukhan-etan-yah samamarisyati). In Kaśikhanda (57. 33) the name Dhundhi applied to Ganośa is derived from the root'dhudhi' in tbe sense of 'searching' (anvegane dhudhir-ayam prathitosti dhātuh). Compare the Marathi verb dhuddane, 

The Tri S. discusses at some length (pp. 98-100) the question whether sids committed in all past lives are destroyed by entering Kasi or whether it is only the sins committed during the present life that are destroyed. Some hold the view that sins committed in this life only are destroyed by visiting Kasi and by bath in the various sacred spots the sins of previous lives are destroyed, Others hold that by entering Kāšī the sins of all past lives are destroyed, but bath at various sacred spots brings about only the cessation of the tendency to sin in different lives, Nārāyapabbatta puts forward several other views and says that wise men should hold the view that appears proper. 

Many of the purānas lay down rules about how one dwell. ing in Kāśi should act. The injunction is that in Kāsi ono should not commit the slightest sin, since the punishment 28 far more heavy. The Matsya (chap, 185, 17-45) and Kuśl khanda, chap. 96, narrate the story of Vyāsa, who whilo vandering about for alms in Kasi, did not secure alms and

being hungry and angry was on the point of cursing Kāśi in the words quoted below 1461 when Siva coming to know his mind assumed the form of a householder, gave hita the best of food and ordered Vyāsa not to enter Kaśīksetra as he was an irri table man, but allowed hina to do so on the 8th and 14th tithis only. The Kašikhanda 96. 12-80 and 119-180 speak at great length about how one residing in Kāsi should conduct himself. 

Some miscellaneous matters in connection with Banaras may be set out here. Vārānası being a great tirtha, srāddha for the benefit of ancestors should be performed there and if it is not possible to perform a śrāddha with all details, at least offerings of pindas should be made.1452 The constiuction of mathas for those who practise penance there and endowing them with means for their maintenance are highly eulogized. 1463 

In the 12th century AD, there was a Kapālamocanaghāt 1464 situated on the Ganges. In a grant published in E. I. vol. IV p. 110 dated samvat 1178 (112% A D.) the Emperor Govindacandra bestowed a village on a brāhmapa pamed Vyāsa after bathing at the Kapāla-mocapaghatta in Banaras where the Ganges flows to the north. The story of Kapalamocana-tirtha is Darrated in the Matsya-purana, chap. 183, 84-103 and a reference is made to it in Kāśikhanda 33. 116. 

It may be noted that in the Lingapurāna, pūrvārdha, chap. 92 verses 67-100, in Padma,14646 Ādikhanda, chap. 34-37,

The Kāśikhanda, chap 73, 32-36 (quoted by Tri. S. pp. 264–265) mentions 14 of these as Mahālipgas, viz. Omkāra, Trilocana, Mabādava, Krttīvāsas, Ratneša, Candreśvara, Kedara, Dharmesa, Vireśvara, Kamesa, Višvakarmeśvara, Manikarniša, Avimubta, Vigveśvara. It is provided in Kasi kbanda 73 39 that yātrūs of these main lingas should be cele brated every month from the 1st tithi onwards In Kāśikhanda 73. 45-48 there is another series of fourtean great lingas diffe rent from those in chap 73, 32-36. Fourteen āyatanas are named in Kāśikhanda 73. 60-62.14646 Twelve out of these are specified as liogas in Lingapurāna I. 92,67-107, In Kāśikhanda chapters 83 and 84 are enumerated about 125 tirthas of Banaras In chap. 94, 36 of the Kašikhanda 36 principal lingas are re ferred to (14 Omkarādi, 8 Dakşeśvaradi and 14 Sailešādı). From considerations of space the other lingas and tirthas are not mentioned here. But out of all these Visvešvara is said to give quick results. 

It is laid down that every one residing in Kāsi must repair every day to the Ganges, take a bath in the Madikardikā and visit Visvešvara,1465 

What happens if a person commits sims outside Kāšs, comes to Kāśi and then dies, or if a resident of Kāśi comraits sins in Kāģi but dies either at Kāść or outside it? The Tri. S. after quoting several verses from the Kāśikhanda, Padma purāna and Brahmavaivarta states the following conclusions (p. 268). Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed by coming to Kāsi, 1466 He who residing in Kāśi is always addicted to sins becomes a psūca (goblin) for thirty thousand years, again dwells in Kāsi, secures highest knowledge and then obtains

Kāśi and committing of sins

moksa, Those who being residents of Kaši commit sins have not to undergo the tortures of Yama whether they die in Kasi or elsewhere. Those who after committing sins in Kaśī die there will be punislied by Kalabhairava Those who die else where (after committing sins in Kāśi) first undergo torments inflicted by the gangs of Siva called Yāma, then undergo tor ments inflicted by Kalabhairava for thirty thousand years, are thon born as mortal men, then die in Kāśi and secure release (from samsāra) at the end. 

It is remarkable that the Kaşıkhanda 1467 states that a little to the north of Kāśi, Visnu assigned a place for his resid ence called Dharmaksetta and that there Visou assumed the form of Buddha. This is a clear reference to Sārnath about five miles by road to the north of Banaras, where Buddha delivered his first sermon The general rule for ascetics is that for eight months they must move from place to place and may spend the four months of the rainy season or two months in one place; but this rule is abrogated where ascetics enter Banaras and it is laid down that they should not leave Kaši at all. 14676 

The Kašīkhanda remarks 'For devotees of Siva who are full of faith there is, even in great calamities, no other remedy except the water of the feet of the image of God Incurable diseases even, whether affecting the body outside or inside, are got rid of by the touch with faith of the water of (washing the image of) the deity.

It is not possible to deal with this vast mass in this worko Bat it is impossible not to say a few words about the many conflicting views on certain important matters put forward by scholars for about three quarters of a century. Those who are deeply interested in the history and antiquities of Gaya should carefully read the following books and papers; Dr. Rajendralal Mitra's 'Buddha-Gaya' with 51 plates (1878); General Cunningham's 'Mahabodhi' with 31 plates at the end (1992); L.

History of Dharmasastra 

The most important work on Gayā relied upon in such works as the Tristhali-setu and in modern times is the Gaya mālātmya that occurs at the end of the Vayupurāna (ohapters 105–112 of the Anandāśrama ed.). Scholars differ about the antiquity of these chapters. Rajendralal Mitra assigned the Gaya-māhātmya to the 3rd or 4th century AD. O'Malley was inclined to hold that the legend of Gayāsura was invented in the 14th or 15th century, principally on the ground that the Gayāwals profess the Vaissava faith established by Madhva. cārya 1:68 and acknowledge as their spiritual head the mahant of Hari Narasimhapura; vide J. A. S. B. vol. LXXI (1903) P. 4. To my mind there is hardly anything in this. The Gayawals are notorious for their indolence, dissoluteness and ignorance and they are a dying race. O'Malley himself notes in the paper mentioned above at p. 8) that originally the families of Gayawals were 1484, that in Buchanan Hamilton's time they numbered about 1000, that in 1893 a Gayāwal counted 128 families, that in the census of 1901 there existed only 168 males (as pure Gayawals) and 153 females. Gaya is a place sacred to Yispu and if the Gayāwals had to turn in medieval times for support to some great acārya they would naturally choose to align themselves with the Vaisnava ācārya Madhye rather than with Sankara Dr. Barua, after an elaborate exami nation of the several iterns of evidence, holds 'that' the Gaya mahatmya is not earlier than the 13th or 14th century A. D. (vol. I. P. 64 of Gaya and Buddha Gaya'). From considerations of the space at my disposal I cannot examine in detail his argu ments His conclusion is vitiated mainly for two reasons. He relies too muoh on the dubious and unconvincing argument from silence. He examines the account of Gayā that appears in - the Vanaparya and compares it with the fuller account in the Gayāmābatmya and arrives at the rather startling conclusion "The Gayā proper as known to the Epic (the Mabābhārata) is essentially a place sacred to Yama Dharmarāja, Brahma and Sivasūlin, and Vispu and Vaisna. vism has no place in it either as a name or as an idea. Except 

1468 There is conduct abont the dates of Madhvācārya's birth and death. The-Uttaradı-matha records give sake 1040 (1118 A. D.) and saxe 1120 (1198 A. D.) as the dates of his birth and death respectively. Th19 15 said to conflict with the date given in Madhva's FEDETTrafora viz. that he was born 10 Trasto 4300. In a paper published in the Journal of the Annamalai University, vol III for 1934 pp. 245ff, the correct dates are said to be 1238 A.D.-1317 A, D.

Dr. Barua on Gayāmāhātmya

Brahmayūpa, Sivalinga and Vrsabha there is no refe rence to any structural erection nor any iconic suggestion'. In order to show how this conclusion is not at all justified the references to Gaya in the Epic and other Sanskrit works will hare to be set out and compared with each other and with the Gayāmāhātmya. The second reason that vitiates Dr. Barua's conclusion is the wrong interpretation that he puts on yerse 12 of the Inscription edited by Kielhorn in I A, yol 16, 

I shall now turn to the name Gayā and references to it or similar names from the Rgveda downwards. A Gaya, son of Plati, is the reputed author of two hymns of the Rgveda (X. 63 and X 64). In Rg X, 63. 17 and X. 64. 17 we have the words 'astāri jado divyo Gayena' (the divine host was praised by Gaya). So Gaya was a proper name applied to a composer of Rgvedic hymns. In the Rg, the word Gaya has several other senses, which are not material here. In the Atharvaveda (1. 14.4) Gaya appears to be a wonder-yorker or a sorcerer along with Asits and Kaśyapa. Even in the Vedic Samhitās Asuras, Dāsas and Raksasas are credited-with tricks and magic. Vide Rg VII 99.4, VII 104,24-25 and Atharva IV, 23.5. It is not difficult to imagine how a sorcerer Gaya could have been transformed into Gayāsura later on, Proceeding further, the Nirukta 1469 while explaining 'idam Vigdur-vi cakrane tredbā nidadhe padam' (Rg. I 22. 17) gives two very interesting interpretations, one explaining the verse as a natural phenomenon and the other explaining it from geographical or legendary points of view Ho (Visou) puts down his foot in three ways. According to Šakapūni, Vispu plants his foot on the earth, in mid air (sky) and heaven; according to Aurnavābha, on Samarohada, on Vişnu pada and on Gayaģiras.' Whatever the Vedic verse may mean, it is clear that two interpretations had arisen several centuries before Christ and if the usual dates about Buddha's nirvana are accepted surparābba and Yāska both flourished before Buddha. Vide S. B. E. vol. XII pp. XXII-XXII for Buddha's nirlūna being placed at 483 B, C. according to Ceylonese chronicle, while sonie western scholars would place it between 429-400 B. C 1470 Gayasiras is named in the Vanaparva (87. _____1469 वेधा निधत्ते पदम् । पृथिव्यामन्तरिक्ष दिवीति शाकपूणिः। समारोहणे विष्णुपदे TAFETTET STUET: 1 foi 12 19,

B. E. vol. XII p. 134) in which last it is said that after having dwelt at Uruvela, Buddha accom panied by a thousand bhikkhus went to Gayāsisa (which is the Pali equivalent of Gayasirga). Traditions of Gaya as a king of the territories round about Gsyā are mentioned in Jaina and Buddhist works. The Uttaradhyayapasūtra (S BE, vol. 45 p. 86 and note 3 there) states that he was son of king Samudravijaya of Rajagrha and became the 11th Cakravartin, The Buddbacarita of Aśyaghosa states that Buddha visited the hermitage called a city of the royal sage Gaya, that the saint (future Buddha) fixed his dwelling on the pure bank of the Nairanjanā river (S. B. E vol. 49 part 1 p. 132, Canto XII. 87-88) and p. 193 (chap XVII, 8 of the same work) and that Buddha went to the hermitage of Kāšyapa at Gayā called Uruyilvā, The same vork (S. BE , 49 part 1 192) speaks of Dharmātays where dwelt 700 ascetics whom Buddha helped to enter nirvana Visnupada occurs in the Vispudharmasūtra 85 40 as a holy place very fit for śrāddha. In my opinion at least Aurnayabha held that in & particular region there were three places on which according to the legends current in his day the foot-prints of Vispu's foot could be seen 1471.

Vişnupada and Gayaśıras

these, Visnupada and Gayaģiras ara well-known; hence it would not be unreasonable to hold that 'Samārohana' is a place and has to be located somewhere near the other two. Samārohana means 'mounting up' or 'ascending'. This word probably refers to the ascent of the hill that rises up from the river Phalgu, It is also possible that it is the same ag the Udyanta hill echoing with the varbling (of birds) 1472 I therefore hold that at least 600 years before Christ (and hence' even before Buddha) there was a tradition about Visno's footprints in at least two well-known places viz. Vispupada and Gaya-siras (both in Gayā). Even if some other work does not mention any one of these it does not follow from mere non-inention that that spot was not so named or did not exist. 

Let us now turn to the Vanaparvā. Dr. Barua mainly relies, on Vanaparva 84, 82-103 and 95, 9-29. But some preliminary remarks must be made before the two passages are examined. 

The Nāradiyapurāna (uttara, 46. 16) states that Gayasiras extends from Krauñcapada to Phalgutirtha, 

Vanaparva chapter 82 sets out Pulastya's replies to Bhisma's question about tirthas. First comes Puskara (verses 20-40), then Jambumārga, Tandujikāšrama, Agastyasasah, Mahākāa, Kotitirtha, Bhadravata (Sthānutirtha), Narmadā, Prabhāsa and several other tirthas (not in any particular order but selected at random). In chap 83 Kuruksetra is described at some length, 

Before discussing the most important passage of the Vana. parva (viz. 84. 82–103) we must see what precedes the descrip tion of Gayā. Dr. Barua and many of those that have written on this passage have not carefully considered the implications of verses 1-81 of chapter 84 and also of the following chapters. In Vanaparva 84. 1-81 the author makes Dhaumya name 

(Continued from last page) gupta. Therefore Visau's footpnat existed on a bill dear Delbı in the 4th Ceptory A D. There is no sound reaspo advanced why it could not have existed at Gayā about the same time or even earker, Besides in the Rām. 11 68 19 a Ftgtę south of the river at it is mentioned. 

1472. Dr Barna regards mac 1Vapaparva 84.93 as the name of a peat (vol I p. 246). But this appears to be wrong It is an adjective of an (T ) that immediately precedes, I have not come across any peak called TTGANICA 10 any other work and Dr. Barna does not cite any other text in support of his viele, gen mould mean 'the bill of sunrise,' n'ot aecessarily for the whole of Aryāvarta but in the place where both four and TATOTT Bere situated

Kanakhala, the confluence of Ganga and Yamunā, Kubjāmraka) and then comes to speak of the sacred spots in Gayā 1473 It is therefore clear that the intention of the author is not to speak exhaustively about any tirtha. For this reason some tirthas are described twice in the Vang parva. For example Naimisa is very highly praised 10 chap. 84. 59-64 and again in chap. 87. 6-7.

Sacred spots in Gaya and Panaparva 649 

from the manner in which tirthas in Gayā are pamed and des cribed that the writer of Vanaparva (chap. 84. 82–103) meant to be exhaustive as regards the holy spots in Gayā or the legends about Gaya, This conclusion is very much strengthened by the fact that in the Apušāsanaparva three seored spots in Gayā are mentioned which do not occur in Vanaparva 84. 82-103 viz. 'In Gayā a man becomes purified in Asmappstha (the same as Pretaśilā), on the bill Niravinda and of even a third brāhmana murder in Krauṛcapadi'. 1474 These three, A.śmaprstha, Nira vinda and Krauñoapadī, are in addition to those sacred spots that are mentioned in Vanaparya 84, In Vayu 109, 15 a hill Aravindaka is said to be a peak of the Silāparyata and Nāradīya (uttara 47, 83), Vāyu 108.75 and Nāradiya (uttara 46.16) men tion the hill Krauñcapada (Munda-prstha was so oalled) There fore it is clear that three important sites in the Gayāmahatmya are mentioned by the Anušāsanaparya. 

It was unfortunate that Dr. Barua confined his attention on the question of the antiquity of Gayā to merely three works yiz, the Vanaparva chapters 84 and 95, the Agnipurāna chap. 114-116 and the Vāyupurāna chapters 105-112. He did not care to investigate all the other Purānas nor did it strike him that the explanation of three padas of Vispu furnished by Aurnayābha probably referred to spots around Gayā alone, Other Puranas such as Padma (Adikhanda 38.2-21), Garuda I chapters 82-86, and the Nāradiya (uttara chap. 44-47) contain much that concerns Gayā and all of them have many verses in common. The critical edition of the Mahābhārata (published by the B O.R.I., Poona) reads 'sāvitram padam' (chap. 82.81) for 'savitryāstu padam of the Bombay edition. The reading of the critical edition is supported by numerous and ancient Mss, Further, the printed Padmapurāna (in Ādikhanda 38. 13) Teads 'Savitram padam' and thus lends support to the reading adopted in the critical edition. The words 'sūvitram padam' may be taken to mean the foot-print of Visou (Savitr). Dr. Barua goes very much further than the facts warrant when he says that there is no reference in the Vanaparva to any struc tural erection or iconic suggestion. It is clear that there must have been an image of Dharma, since the Vanaparva speaks of

All these Trould surely be things that have an 'iconic suggestion. NO POTCT, Dr. Barua forgets for the moment that, according to the Chinese trareller F& Hien who visited India between 399.13 'Å. D., the Gaya of the Hindu faith was all emptiness and desolation (ride Legge's translation p. 37) that Gayā might hare suffered from earthquakes befora 400A. 

It is possihie D. (as it is a region that is liable to severe carthquakes eren in modern times) and therefore no structural eraction of t'ia ancient city of Garā (to which ancient Pali works and tra Lalitaristara p 311 refer) might liare been left in Ha llion's day. Gayā appears to have passed through several vicissitudes. Some centuries before the Christian cra it was in cristence ari vas a flourishing torn, Bs 400 AD. it had been reduced to desolation. But in the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang notes that the Hindu Garā ras a torn with 1000 brāhmana families (ride Beal's B R. 11.W. rol.

Dr, Barua has also misunderstood rerse 12 of the inscrip tion at Gayā edited by Dr. Kielhorn in LA. 16 p. 63 ff. The verse1473 set out below may be translated as follons That vise (prince Yaksapala) caused to be constructed a temple for the images of Maunāditya and the other gods (mentioned in it), he dug up the famous Ullaramūnası loka and esta blished a sattra (charity house for food) near to Al ara (vata).

engraved about 1040 A.D. Dr. Barue thought that Uttaramānasa was dug up at that time and therefore Uttaramānasa tank is taken to be not older tban 1040 A D. and that it and many of the sacred spots must have been later and the Gayā. māhātmya which speaks of Uttarmānasa must be much later than the 11th century A. D. But Dr Barua is entirely mistaken in this. If a tank was dug up for the first time at the time of the inscription, it is impossible that it should have been called "kuyata' (famous). The tank can become famous some centuries after it was dug. Uttarmānasa tank is mentioned as a sacred spot in Vayupurāna 77. 108 (which verse is quoted about 1110 A.D. in the Kalpataru on tirtha at p. 168), Vāyu 82.21, Agni 115. 10. Therefore Uttaramānasa tank was well known at least in the 8th or 9th century AD. What the inscription means is either that the famous tank bad silted up and so it was dug up or that it was made longer, broader and deeper in about 1040. That is all. 

In my opinion the Gayāmābātmya (Vāyu, chap. 105-112), though possibly later than the main text of the Vayupurāna, cannot be placed so late as the 13th or 14th century A. D. It is really & patch-work from many sources of earlier times such as the Vanaparva, Anusāsanaparva, Padma I 38, the Naradiya (uttara) chap. 44-47 Several verses and half verses of it are repetitions (such as the half verse 'Gayāyām aksayam śrāddham japalomatapāmsi ca' Vāyu 108 35 and Vāyu 82,43 quoted as from Vāyu in Kalpataru on tirtha p. 167, and Vayu 110. 29-30 are the same as Vāyu 105,37-38. So also Vāyu 82, 31-33 are the same as Vāyu 110, 51-53. Dr. Barua does not notice that in chap. 82 of the Vayu (20-24) several sub-tirthas of Gayā are sa pressly mentioned viz. Brahmakunda, Prabhāsa, Pretaparvata, Uttaramāgasa, Udici, Kanakhala, Daksinamādaga, Dharn āranya, Gadādhara, Matanga; 80 also chap 77.97-108 mention Grdbrakūta, hermitage of Bharata, Matangapada, Munda prstha and Uttaramānasa.

one (of whom) goes to Gayā, or performs the Aśyamedha sacri fice or lets loose a nila bull' (the pitrs may be gratified ). Then Vanaparya chap. 87 goes on to refer to the holy river (maha nadi) Phalgu, the hill Gayaśiras, the Aksayya Vata, where food offered to pitrs becomes inexhaustible. In Vanaparva 95 men tion is made of Brabnasaras (where Agastya went to Dharma rāja i. e. Yama, verse 12), of Aksayavata (v. 14) which is an imperishable place of worship and where the fruit (of offerings made) is inexhaustible; it further states that king Gaya, son of Amūrtarayas, 1471a performed a sacrifice in which food and fees in plenty were distributed (verses 18-19). Vas. (XI. 42) states: when a man goes to Gayā and offers food his ancestors become delighted like agriculturists that rejoice when there is good rain and pitrs become (really) putrın (having a son) on account of such a son The Visnudharmasūtra, chapter 85, 1478 mentions by name about 55 holy places that are most proper for śrāddha among which those connected with Gayā are Gayāsirsa, Aksaya vata, Phalgu, Uttaramānasa, Matangavāpi, Visnupada, and winds up by quoting three verses as gātās sung by pitrs, - Yāj. I 261 states that whatever a man gives while in Gayā leads to inexhaustible rewards. Atri-smrti (55-58 ) refers to a son's going to Gayā for the benefit of the pītrs, to a bath in Phalgu and tarpana of pitrs in the river, to seeing Gadādhara (Visnu) at Gayā and to Gayāśīrsā. Sankha (14 27-28) refers 1479 to several tirthas (one being Gaya) the offerings made at which

The Likhita-Smrti speaks 1480 of the importance of Gayā as follows: In whosesoever name a pinda is offered at Gayāģiras, whether for oneslf or for another, that person, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven that man secures release (from samsāra). The Kūrmapurāna remarks that ono should desire to have many sons so that if one out of them goes to Gayā on some other business and offers sraddha, ho thereby saves his pitrs and himself reaches the highest goal. The Matsyapurana (22. 4-6) quoted by the Kalpataru (on tirtha p. 163) speaks of Gayā as pitrtirtha and as the best among tirthas where Bralmā himself dwells and also has the verse 'estavyā bahavah putrah'. 

In the Gayāmāhātmya (Vāyupurāda, chapters 105-112) thiero aro about 560 verses. An attempt will be made here to give a brief summary of it and some of the important verses will be quoted. Chapter 105 is general and briefly indicates some of the main topics dealt with in the following chapters. It states that in Syotavārāhakalpa Gaya performed a saorifice and Gayū was named after him 1481, that putrs hanker after gons because the son that goes to Gayā saves the pitrs from hell 1482, At Gayā a man should offer pindas to his father and others and even to himself but without sesame; all the five mortal sins lika brāhmapa-murder are removed by the perfor mance of śrāddba at Gayā. A. pinda offered after uttering the name and gotra of the recipient by the son or any other person in Gayā leads that person to the imperishable bralıma 1483, Moksa ia fourfold (i. e, results in four ways) viz. by knowledge of brahma, śrāddha at Gayā, death in (a fight for preventing) the seizure of cows and residence in Kuruksetra and śrāddha at

$rüddha at Gaya 

Gaya renders the others unnecessary 1484Srāddha may be performed at Gayā at all times, even in an intercalary month, on the anniversary of one's birthday, or even when Jupiter and Venus are invisible or when Jupiter is in Leo. One should honour the brāhmanas (of Gayā) that were established there by Brahmā; when they are gratified all deities together with the pitrs are gratified. Tonsure 1485 and fast are to be observed at all tirthas except in Kuruksetra, Viśālā, Virajā and Gayā. An ascetic 1485 (sannyasin) should not offer pindas (at Gaya) but should merely exhibit (hold up) bis staff and should put it down on Visnupada The (whole) Gayāksetra is five lerošas in extent and Gayāśiras is ono krośa and all the tirthas of the three worlds are centered in these two 1487, AC Gayā one may offer (to pitrs) pindas by means of payasa (rice cooked in milk), boiled rice, barley flour, fruits and roots, the cake of sesame (after oil is extraoted), sveetmeats or jag gery with ghee or with curds alone or with invigorating honey. In a śrāddha at Gayā, the procedure consists in pre paring 1488 a seat for the pindas, the offering of pindas, the sprinkling of water again (on the kusa grass), giving fees and declaration of dinner (to brāhmadas); but there is no invoca. tion of pitrs, no curtains for privacy and no blemish due to śrāddha being seen (by undesirable persons or animals) Those who desire to reap the full fruit of śrāddha performed at a tirtha (like Gayā) must give up passionate longings, anger and

The famous river Vaitarani. has come down to Gayā; one taking a bath in it and donating a cow saves 21 generations in his family, One should go to the Aksayapata and gratify the (Gaya) brāhmanas. There is no spot in Gayā which is not a sacred place, 1489 

Chap. 106 narrates the story of Gayasura. Gayāsura, a very powerful asura 125 yojanas in height and 60 yojanas in girth, performed severs austerities for thousands of years on the nountain called Kolābala. The gods, anxious and torment ed by his austerities, went to Brahmā for protection. Bralmā took them to Siva who proposed to go to Visnu. Brahmā, Sira and the gods praised Visnu, who appeared to them and said that they should, riding their respective conveyances, go to Gaya sura. Vispu asked him why he practised søvere austerities and said that the boon he would ask would be granted. He asked the boon that he should be purer than al the gods, sages, mantras, ascetics &c The gods said "let it be so' and left for heaven, All people who saw or touched Gayāsura's holy body went to heaven. The capital of Yama became deserted and so he went to Brahmā who took him to V790u who asked Brahma to request Gayāşura to give his pure body for the purpose of a 880 rifice. Gayāsura agreed and fell down on the earth towards the southwest with his head on the north on Kolāhala mountain and feet to the south. Brahma collected materials and mind-born Tiinks (about 40 are named) and performed a sacrifice on the body of Gayāsura, That body, however, was not stable but moved and hence Brahmā asked Yama to place on Gayasura's bead a šilā (stone slab) that was in Yama's house, Yama did so; pot Gayāsura's body together with the śılā still moved. Brahma asked Siya and other gods to stand immoveable on the sila. They did so and yet the body moved. Hence Brabma went to Vispu and requested him to make the body and slā stablo, Visnu gave his own muriand though it was placed on the sila it still moved. Then Visni sat on the sila in three forms piz Japārdana, Pundarika and Adi-Gadādhara, Brahmā in five forms (Prapitāmaba, Pitāmaha, Phalgyisa, Kedāra and Kanakeśvara), Vinayaka in the form of an elephant, the Sun in three forme, the Goddesses Laksimi (as Sita), Gauri (as Mangala), Gayatri

and Sarasvati. As Gayasura was made stable by the first Gadā 

(mace) wielded by Hari, therefore Hari was called Ādigada dhara.1490 Gayāsura complained 'why am I deceived? I have giver my pure body to Brabmā for the latter's sacrifice. Would I not have become stable at the mere word of Visou (why tor ment me with the mace ?).' Then the gods asked him to choose a boon. He chose 'As long as the earth, mountains, the Sun, Moon and stars last, may Brahmā, Visnu and Siva and the other gods remain on the silal Let this sacred spot be known by my name, Let all tirthas be centered in the midst of Gayā which is five krošas in extent and in Gayāśiras which is one brosa and do good to people. May all the gods remain here in manifest forms (images &c ) and unmanifest forms (such as footprints &c)! Those to whom śrāddha with pindas is offered may go to the world of Brahma and all grave sins like brāhmana-murder be destroyed at once. The gods said 'Let it be so.' Then Brahma gave to the brāhmadas Gayā (with its extent of five krošas ), 55 villages, well-furnished houses, desire-yielding cow and trees, & river flowing with milk, golden tells, heaps of food, but enjoined on them not to beg from any one else. But the brāhmapas, greedy as they were, performed a sacrifice for Dharma in Dharmāranya and begged him for fees, Then Brahmā came, cursed them and took away everything from them. When the brāhmanas bewailed that they had been deprived of everything and their livelihood should be provided for, Brahmā said that they would live on the charity of pilgrims to Gayā and those who would honour them would be honouring Brahmā. 

Chap. 107 deals with the story of the silā 1491 that was placed on the head of Gayāsura for making it stable. Dharma had a daughter called Dharmavrata Dharma could not find a bridegroom worthy of her virtues and accomplishments and asked her to perform tapas for the purpose. She performed severe austerities (subsisting only on air) for ten thousand years. Marici, one of the mind-born sons of Brahma, once saw her and asked her to become his vife. Dharmavrata asked him to request her father Dharma, Marici approached Dharma who

History of Dharmasastra gave her in marriage to Marlci, who took her to his hermitage and had one hundred sons from her. Once Marici being tired lay down for sleep and asked Dharmavrata to shampoo his feet, While she shampooed his feet Brahmā (her father-in-law) oame there. She left off shampooing her husband's foot and got up to receive with honour her husband's father. In the meanwhile Marici awoke and not seeing his wife oursed her to be a sila (atone slab) as she disobeyed his order by giving up the sham pooing of his feet. She being innocent of any fault got angry and was about to curse Marici but said 'Mahadeva will curse you'. She, standing in the midst of Gārhapatya fire, performed tapas and Marici also did the same. The gods led by Indra got anxious as usual and went to Visou who asked her to choose a boon. She prayed that the ourse pronounced by her husband be annulled. The gods said that Marici being a great sage the curse could not be annulled and asked her to choose some other boon, She said that she should be a šija more holy than all rivers, sages and gods and that all tirthas should stand in the slab of stone, that those who would bathe in the tirthas on the silā and offer pindas and grāddha should be able to go ta brahmaloka, that all holy rivers like the Ganges should alvays remain in her. The gods conceded what she prayed for and said that when she would become stable on the head of Gayasura, they would all stand on the gila. 

Chap. 108 presents numerous divergences in the Mas In the Anandāśrama edition its contents briefly are; The sila was placed on the head of Gayāsura and therefore there was union of two very, holy objects, on which Brahmā performed Aśramedha and when the gods came to receive their share of the sacrificial offerings the silā said to Visnu and others 'pro mise that you would remain on the silk and would bring about the release of pitrs'. The gods agreed and they stayed on the sila in the form of images and foot-prints. As the silk was placed on the back of the head of the Asura the hill was called Mundaprstha (lit, the back of the head) which gave Brahma. loka to pitrs. Then the chapter speaks of a hill called Pra bhāsa, of Rāmatirtha near the place where the great river -(Phalgu) and Prabhāsa hill meet, the hermitage of Bharata, of Matangapada, of the bal to be offered to Yamarāja and Dharma raja and to the dogs of Yama, viz. Śgāma and Sabala, of the Udyantaka bill near the left of sila, of Agastya-kunda, and nümṛrous other holy places such as Grdhrakūta hill, the her

mitage of Oyavana, the river Punahpunā, Krauñca-pada, Janārdana on Bhasmakūta. 

The story of Gayāsura has puzzled Mitra and subsequent writers. Mitra holds that nothing appears more absurd or stupid than the story of Gayāsura who, he emphasizes, is not a demon or & vicious monster, but a devout Vaisnava ('Bodh Gaya' pp. 15-16). The story of Gayāsura is not unique. The Puranas abound in stories that appear to modern minds absurd and puerile. Besides, there were several asuras like Prahlada, Bāna (devotee of Siva) and Bali (who was an exemplary and pious king and a worshipper of Visnu) that were not monsters but good and devout persons, and yet fought with gods. For ex ampie, Kürmapurāna (I. 16. 59-60 and 91-92) narrates that Prahlada fought with Nisimha; the Padma (Bhumikhanda 1.8) calls him a Mabābhāgavata but states that he first fought with Vishu and entered Vaisgavitanu; while Vāmanapurāna (ohap. 7-8) speaks of his fight with Naranārāyana In Pali works (e. g. Anguttara-nikāya, part IV pp. 197–204) he is called Pahārāda and asur inda (asurendra). Vide Anguttara-nikaya (text) vol. IV p. 197. For Bali who was grandson of Prahlada, a good king and a devotee of Visnu, vide Brahmapurāna, chap. 73, Kūrma I, 17, Vāmana (chapters 77 and 92). For Bāna, son of Bali and the fight of Bāna helped by Siya vith Krspa, vide Brahma chap. 205-206 and Vispupurāpa V. 33. 37-38. 

According to Dr, Rajendralal Mitra (in 'Bodh-Gaya' pp. 14. 18) the story of Gayasura is an allegory of the vanquishing of Buddhism by Brahmanism. O' Malley thought (J. A S. B. vol, LXXII part 3 p. î for 1904) that the Gayāgura legend represents an amalgamation or compromise of Brahmanism with the popular demonolatry which preceded Brahmanism, Dr, Barua critisizes both theories and appears to hold (rol, I. pp. 40-41) that the idea underlying the legend is to impress on people's minds the high sanctity of the Gayā tange of hills along the western bank of the river Phalgu, that Gayā figures nowhore in Buddhism, that Gaya 1492 or Namuci or Vrtra is represented as a demon of darkness and as an enemy of Indra and that the Vedio word Trivikraina and the interpretation of Aurparābha are the nucleus of the legend of Gayasura. From considerations of space it is not possible to discuss these 

• 1492 It is not cicar wbence' Dr Barua derived his information that in the Veda Gaya is represented as a demon like Vrtra. In tbe Rg. at least Gaza is not a demon like Vrtra,

theories here. To my mind it appears that Gaya bad become a famous pitrtirtha centuries before Christ and that the logond of Gayāsura is a post facto attempt to account for the sanctity" of the place and the numerous shrines and holy places that lod sprung up round Gaya, 

Chap. 109 deals with the questions how Adi-Gadadhara abided in manifest and unmanifest forms, how bis gadā (muce) was produced and how the tirtha called Gadalola becamo a destroyer of all sins: There was a poworfu) Agira called Gada, who, when Bralımā. requested, gave up lis bones to Brahmā. Viśvakarma, at the desire of Brahma, fasbioned a wonderful mace out of the bones. In the times of Srayanbhura Manu an Asur3 Damed Heti, son of Bralmā, porformed severe austerities for thousands of divine years. He secured from Brahina and other gods the boon that he could not be killed by gods, dartyas, men or with such weapons as the discus of Kısna and others. Heti conquered the gods and became Indra. The gods went to Hari and roquested him to kill Heti. He asked for a powerful veapon and the gods gave him the mace manufactured from the bones of Gada and Visnu killed Heti with the Gadā. This story about demon Hoti is mentioned in Agni 114 26-27 and Nāradiya (uttara) 47.9.-21. Hari is called Adi-Gadadhara because 1992 he was the first to wield that mace and stood on the silā on the head of Gavagura. supported by the Gadā, in order to make (the hoad of Gayayura) stable. Ha shows himself in the forın of hilla viz. tho Mundaprstba hill, the Prablāsa and other bills. Thoso and Aksayavata, Phaigu and other rivers are the non-nonifest forms of Adigadadbara, The Visnupada, Rudrapadı, Brahma. pada and other padas are the non-manifest and momfost forma of Gadādhara, 1493 The image of Gadadhara is purely a inani.

fest form. Asura Heti was killed by Vispu and went to Visbu loka. When the body of Gayāsura was made stable Brahma sang a hymn of praise to Visou who asked Brahmā to choose a boon Brahmā said 've (gods) shall not abide in the silā with out you, but shall remain therein together with you if you have a manifest forin." 1194 Visnu said 'be it so' and Visnu stood on Gayāsiras in the Adigadadhara form and as Janārdana and Pupdarīkāksa. Siva also praised Visou (Vāyu 109. 43-50). The Vāyu speaks at several places of 'vyaktāvyakta' symbols of the deity (chap. 109, 20 and 43-45) What is meant is Visnu is non-manifest in Phalgu, vyaktāvyakta in Vispupada and manifest in images and statues (vide Tristhalīsetu p. 365, prati masyarūpi vyaktah).

noon the pilgrim should go to the Pretaśılā, take a bath in the Bralmakunda, offer tarpada to the gods and perform sraddha of his sapindas on the Pretasila with the mantras set out in Vayu (110,10-12) and offer pipdas to bis ancestors, In Astakās, in Vrddbišraddha, at Gayā and on the anniversary of death, one mas offer a śrāddba separately to one's mother but on all other occasions with her husband. 1495 To the sapindas other than one's patorna) ancestors he should offer sraddha to the south (of the place whero he offers to his father &c.) viz, should spread kugas and once offer Fater mixed with sesame and should offer them & pinda made of barley flour and repeat the mantras (Vāyu 110. 21-22). The pindas to be offered at Gayaširas may be in size as 14% big as one's closed hand, or an undried amalaka (myrobalan) fruit or of the size of sami leaves. By means of these he saves seven gotras viz, that of his father, of his mother, of his wife, sister, daughter, paternal aunt and maternal auzit. Water mixed with sesame and pindas are offered to all persons on the maternal grandfather's side, to all bandhus, to all infants, to persons cremated or not cremated, to persons that were killed by lightning or robbers or that commit ted suicide in various says and to those who may be undergo ing torments of Hells of various kinds and those who have become beasts or birds or insects or trees owing to evil deeds (Vāyu 110, verses 30-55). The verses of most comprehensive character about offering water have been cited in n. 1237 p. 550 and on pp. 616-617 above.

In chap. 110 it has been stated as shown above that on entering Gayā, a pilgrim takes a bath in the Phaigu water, performs tarpana and śrāddha, then on the same day he goes to the Pretašilā (which is a part of the Sujā ag stated in Vāyu 108 15) and performs a śrāddha there and offers pindas with boiled rice and ghee (Vāyu 110.15).

this the persons for whom this is done become free from the position of pretu. It is stated (in Vayı 108, 17--22) that one ghould bathe in the Rāmatirtha which is near the place where Phalgu meets the Prabhāsa hill. By bath in Rāpatirtha and offering of śrāddha and pinda there the persons for whom this is done become pitrs ( being already free from pretatta by the śrāddha on pretašila). On a hill on the south of Pretašilā one should offer & bali (food offered with kuša, sesame and water) to Yamarāja and Dharmarāja and to the two dogs Syāma and Sabala. On the next day after entering Gayā (i. e. the 2nd day), the pilgrim should proceed to the Pretaparvata 1497 (Vāyu 110.8) and take a bath in the Brahmakunda and perform tar pana, sraddha and giving of pindas mixed with sesame, ghee, curds and honey to his ancestors (father, grandfather &c.) with the mantras "pitā pitāmabascaiva' (Vāyu 110. 23-24). Then the pilgrim should offer on kušas, water, sesame and pindas to persons related in various ways with the mantras * asmat-kule murtā ye ca &o., (Vayu 110. 34-55). He should then invoke the gods to be witnesses to the fact of his having come to Gayā and become free from the debt to the ancestors (Vayu 110. 59-60). It is stated in Vāyu 110,61 that at all eacred spots in Gayā the offering of pindas should be done in the same way as at Pretaparvata 1498. 

On the third day of entering Gaya one has to perform Pañcatīrthi rites 1499 (Vāyu 111, 1 ff.). The pilgrim first bathes in Uttaraniānasa, offers tarpana to gods, gives water and sraddha and pindas to his ancestors with the mantras (Vāyu 110. 21-24). The fruit of this rite is the inexhaustible grati fication of the pitts. Then the pilgrim goes to the three tirthas which constitute Daksinamānasa, viz. Udicītīrtha (on the north), Kanakhala (in the middle) and Daksipamānasa

The pilgrim performs tarpana and srāddha with pindas on Phalgu, This śrāddba at Phalgu results in nukta for the performer and also for those for whose benefit it is performed (muktir-bhavati kartfdām pitinām śraddhatah sadā, Vāyu 110. 13). It is stated that Phalgu is Adi-Gadadhara himself in a fluid form.1500 By bath in Phalgu and seeing Gadadhara a map saves himself, ten ancestors and ten descend ants. Then he worships Gadadhara by a bath with pañcamrla after bowing 1500x to Vasudeva, Sankarsada, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Vispu, Srīdhara. On the 2nd day of the Panca tirthi rites (i. e. 4th day from entering Gayā) the pilgrim should repair to Dharmārapya which is so-called because Dharma per formed a sacrifice there. Then the pilgrim should bathe in the Matapgavāpi (which is situated in Dharmāranya), then he should perform darpana, śrāddha and pindadana at the well called Brahmatirtha and also in the space between Brahma tirtha and Brabmayūpa; then bow to Brahma and Dharm eśvara 1501 He should bow to the Mahābodhi tree (1, e, the sacred pippala) and perform śrāddha also underneath it. Agni 115. 34-37 and Nāradiya (uttara) 45, 104 refer to these tirthas, On the third day of the Paicatirthi rites (i. e, on 5th day from entering Gayā) the pilgrima should bathe in Brahmasaras and perform sraddha with pindas between the Brabmakūpa and the Yüpe (sacrificial post) raised by Brahmā vben he performed a sacrifice, By this śrāddha the pilgrim saves his pitrs. 1502 He should go round the Brahma-yüpa and bor

Here follows the verse ('eko munih' &c.) quoted above (1 1493). Then a balt should be offered to Yama and Dharmaraja, then to the two dogs of Yama, then he should offer a bali to cross and then bathe (in Brahmasaras). This is briefly a summary of Vayu 111 30 40. Some of these details are mentioned by Agni 115.34-40 and Nāradiya (uttara) 46. Then on the 4th day of the Panca. tirthi rites (i, e. 6th day from entrance into Gaya) the pilgrim should take an ordinary bath in the Phalgu and should then perform śrāddhas at the several padas on Gayāśiras which is near Phalgutirtha, Gayāśiras extends from Krauñcapāda up to Phalgutirtha. Śrāddha offered here (on Gayāsiras) becomes inexhaustible,1503 Here Adi-Gadadhara abides in the form of Visnupada, By performing a sraddha with pindas on Visnu pada (which is a footprint on a slab deemed to be of Visņu ) the pilgrim saves one thousand families and takes them and himself to the blissful, inexhaustible and never-ending world of Visou. Then Vāyu 111. 47-56 deal with the towards of śrāddhas performed at Rudrapada, Brahmapada and 14 other padas expressly named by it, 1504 "For whomsoever by name a pilgrim offers a piņda on Gayāśiras, that man, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven he secures moksa.' 

On the 5th day of the Pañcatirthi rites (i. e, the 7th day from entering Gayā), the pilgrim should bathe in the sacred place called Gadālola, 1505 By performing śrāddha with pindas at Gadāloja he takes his pitrs and himself to the world of Brahmā. Then at the Aksayavata he should perform a grāddha

The Tristhalisetu (P 368) remarks that the above are the fixed rites for seven days in Gaya, that other tirthas may be visited according to one's convenience if one stays in Gaya for half a month or a month; that the grāddha at the Pretabilā is to be the first and that at the Aksayayata is to be performed at the ond, 1507 and that although there is variation between the order in which tirthas are to be visited on the several days according to the Vāyupurāna, the Agnipurava and other purāvās, yet as the Vāpupurāna is most detailed as regards Gayā rites, the order therein should be followed and that one not knowing the order may visit the tirthas in any order 1503 exoept Pretašilā and Aksagarata.

hermitage of Bharata, Mundaprstha, Akasagangā, Vaitarani and other rivers and sacred places. It winds up by saying that six Gayās confer muktı (by worship and pindadana at them). viz. Gayāgaja, Gayāditya, Gayatri (tirtha), Gadādhara, Gayā and Gayāśiras.150% 

The Agnipurapa (chap 116. 1-34) has a long list of tirthas at Gayā that is quoted by the Tristhallsetu pp. 376-378, which are passed over here. 

Though the number of tirthas at Gayā is very large, the majority of pilgrims do not visit them all. Visits to three places are absolutely necessary for every pilgrim to Gayā, viz. Phalgu river, Vispupada and Aksayavata, at all of which worship has to be done with milk, water, flowers, sandalwood paste, tambula, lighted lamp and pindas to ancestors have to be offered. The Visnupada temple is built over the footprint of Visou on the rock to the west of the river Phalgu The old town of Gayā was built round Visnupada and it is the largest and most important temple in Gayā. The footprint (about 16 inches in length) deemed to be God Visnu's is inside an octa gonal basin plated with silver. Pilgrims of all castes (except untouchables) surround the basin and cast their offerings in side the basin, though for a substantial payment the priests clear out all people, shut the door for a minute or two and allow a very orthodox or a rich person to make his offerings without being disturbed by anyone else There are 45 vedis (or sacred places) at which the leisured pilgrim may offer pindas in the Gayāksetra which extends from about five miles to the north-west of Old Gayā town to about 7 miles south of it. Though the ancient Buddhist works and Fa Hien and Hiouen Thsang make a distinction between Gaya and Uruvilyā or Uruvela where Buddha attained Enlightenment after six years of severe tapas, the Bodhi tree (Mahābodḥitaru) was recognized by the Gayāmābātmya as one of the sacred places which Hindu pilgring should visit and is so regarded eyen pow. When the Hindus appropriated Buddhist sacred places to themselves it is difficult to say. The Bodbi tree is the oldest historical tree in the world A branch of it is said to have been transplanted to Ceylon in the times of the great Emperor Asoka (about 250-B.C)

History of Dharmadastra and at Kandy in Ceylon a pippala tree is even now shown as that travsplanted tube or the suocessor of that branch. The Gayāģīrsa 1520 is a set of rocky hills such as Gayāšīrsa, Manda prgthā, Prabhāsa, Grdhrakūta, Nagakūta, ranging over one krosa (about two miles). 

It has been already stated abové (p 666) that the rites at the Aksayayata are the last in the pilgrimage to Gayā. The Gaya wal priest binds the thumbs or hands of the pilgrim with a garland of flowers and receives his fees He gives sweatmeats to the pilgrim as prasāda, applies talaka to the pilgrim's forehead, touchss the pilgrim on his back, pronounces the word 'suphala' (the pilgrimage has been fruitfu) or successful), declares that the pilgrim's ancestors have gone to heaven and blesses the pilgrim, It must be noted that there is a special class of priests called Dhaujo who alone (and not the ordinary Gajāwals) have the right of officiating at five vedis vis, at Pretasila, Rāmašili, Rāmakunda, Brahmakunda and Kakabali, that are situated on or about the two hills Rāmašilā and Pretaśılā (vide Bengal District Gazetteers, vol 12 for Gayā p. 66) They are regarded as inferior in status to the tegular Gayāwals. 

One important question on which there is great divergence of views among the medieval digests is about the ancestors to whom grāddha is to be offered at Gayā. In the Vayu and other Purāpas it is frequently said that he who performs srāddha at Gayā becomes free from the debt due to the pitrs 1551 or that what is offered to the pitrs at Gaya, Dharmaprstha, Brahma. Batas, or on the Gayasirsa and under the imperishable Vata tree becomes inexhaustible. In most of these passages the plural of the word 'pitr' is used. Therefore it follows that śrāddba is to be offered in Gaya to three paternal ancestors. And on account of & verse attributed to Gautania, 1512 the three male materna) an Gestors also are to be offered srāddha. The difference arises with 

1510. Gayāsıras and Gaya were according to Buddhist works well known places in Buddba's days. Vide the Mabavagga 1. 21. 1 (S. B. C. vol 13 p. 134 ) cited above (on p. 646) and Anguftara Nikaya (text) vol IV. p 302' HAY FT Tarat For T his

IV] Ancestors for whom Gaya-śrāddha is offered 669, reference to the wives of these six male paternal and maternal ancestors. The Agnipurāna proposes an option (115 10) that the decatās in Gayāsrāddha are nine or twelve. When they are to be nine, the srāddha is for three paternal ancestors, three male ancestors of the mother and the wives of the latter three male ancestors, while there is a separate śrāddha for the mother, paternal grand-mother and paternal great-grandmother. If there are to be twelve devatās in Gayāšrāddha, then all the vives of the paternal ancestors and of maternal ancestors would be included in one śraddha. Aparārka allowed an option (as in Agai) in Gayā-śrāddha. 1513 According to the Smrtyarthasāra 1911 and Hemādri the Anvastakā śrāddha and Gayāstāddha for the paternal ancestors and that for the vives of these (i. e, mother, paternal grandmother &c.) must always be separate, but the śrāddha for the mother's paternal ancestors and their wives should be one (and therefore the devatās will be nine). Yama (verse 80) appears to hold that the mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother are always to be associated with their respective husbands in śrāddha, Some held that the devatās of Gayāśrāddha were only six viz the three male paternal ancestors and three male maternal ancestors.1515 The Tri. s ultimately remarks that the usage of the country should be the deciding principle The Prajapati-smrti (183–184) has some rather contradictory views as to when there would be 12 or 9 or 6 devatās in a srāddha, When there are twelve devatās, the sanhalpa at the Pretašilā. śrāddha which is the model of all the śrāddhas at the other sacred spots in Gaya (with suitable modifications) will be as noted below. 1516 

It should be noted that there are certain special charac teristics of Gayāšrāddha. There is no tonsure (Vāyu 83. 18

One must bonour the Gayāpals alone, and not other brāhmanas, however learned they may be; one should not consider the family or character or learning of Gaya brāhmadas (vide p. 579 above and note 1313). But it has to be remembered that Nārāyapabhatta 1517 did not accept this for all śrāddhas t Gaya, but only as to the śrāddha under the Aksaya. vata, since the Vayu (111, 79-80) again refers under Aksaya vata to the worship of Gaya brāhmabas and sinca following the Daxim of 'caturdhākarana' laid down in Jai. III. 1 26–27 the later specific provision narrows down the wide vords used in the sarlier passage. At Gayā one could offer pioda to oneself but without sesame.1518 The Tri S. ( 

p350) observes (relying on Vāyu) that when a man offers a pinda to bimself, it should be in the hands of the image of Janārdana on Bhasmakūta 5519 and that the pilgrim to Gayā can offer a pinda to himself only when it is certain that he has no son or other adhıların for offering śrāddha. Further, any one related or udrelated, could offer a pinda 1520 to anybody, as laid down in Vayu 'Whether it is one's own son or the son of another (sylio offers), in whosesoever name a pinda is let fall at Gayā, that man attains everlasting Brahma It is desired that anyone may offer a pioda to anybody after uttering that person's Dame and gobra and the latter reaches the highest goa]'

Raghunandana on Gayā-śrāddha paddhati) published in Bengali characters. Then I consulted two mss. viz the Gaya-śrāddha-paddbati of Raghunatha son of Mādhara (D. C.mas. No. 93 of 1891-95) and the Gayāśrāddha-vidhi of Vācaspati (D. C No 245 of 1887-91). The procedure in the Tirthayātrā-tattya of Raghunandaza is set out here briefly with out actually citing in full the Vāyupurāņa passages which it quotes profusely. Raghunandana appears to follow the Tirtha cintamani closely as some of the notes will show. After the pilgrim enters Gayā he sliould first make an appropriate sankalpa1521 for a bath in Phalgu, take the olay from the river, apply it to his body and bathe Then he should perform tarpana2522 to the twelve male and female ancestors (specified in note 1516 abore) Then he should declare a sankalpa that he would per form Gayāšrāddha with the words 'Omladyetyādi Gayatirtha prapti-nimittaka-śrāddhamalam karisye'. Then he should per form & pūrvana-srāddha (described above pp. 485-505) excepting the āvāhana and arghya rites If the pilgrim be unable to per form all the details of śrāddha, he may offer only pindas. Then on the same day he should go to the Pretasila which adjoins the west bank of the river Phalgu and is to the north of Gaya and perform srāddha there as follows: he should perform the purification of the ground, sit down on it, perform ācamana, face the south, rear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, recite the verses (Vāyu 110 10-12 'Kavyavalo...šraddbenānena śāśvatīm), conternplate on his pitrs, perform prānāyāma, sprinkle water on the materials for stāddha after remembering Pundarīkāksa (Visnu), make the sankalpa (set out in note 1516). Ele should go through the whole procedure of srāddha up to the payment of daksipā to brāhmanas. After this he should sit to the south of the altar (where he performed the śrāddha), should wear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, face the south, place on the ground three kušas and after reciting the mantra ( Vāyu 110, 10-12 ) should make an invocation once in the form of offering an añjal of Vater mixed with sesame, then honour the father Frith padya (water for washing the feet), recite the two verses

In this way he should offer pinda to the remaining eleven devatās, viz. paternal grandfather and others (or eight or five according to usage). He should donate A fee according to his means. Then he should sit to the south of the place he so far occupied, spread on the ground kusag having roots but with tips turned to the south, should repeat the mantras (Vāyu 110 10-12), perform on those kušas once an invocation in the form of an anjalı of water mixed with sesame, repeat the two verses (Vayu 110. 22-23 'Pitā pitāmaha...mupatisthatām' with om prefixed 1522a) and shonld offer one pinda made of one handful of barley flour mixed with sesame, kušas, ghee, ourds, water and honey to all the twelve devatās ( ancestors) together. Then follows what is called Sodašīkarma, which is as follows, Nineteen spots for pindaş should be made (each to the south of the preceding) and should be smeared with pañcagavya one after another; then he should spread over each kušas with their tips to the south, should invoke on the kušas the persons intended with the mantras (Vāyu 110. 30-32 asmat-kule mrta... bijodakaih '). should worship them by offering sandalwood paste and the rest, (and if he is performing the rite of sodasi on a spot saored to a specific deity then worship that deity also with an appropriate mantra ), should then offer once as before an anjal of water mixed with sesame and offer pindas beginning from the first spot, each pinda being offered after reciting each of the 19 mantras (Vāyu 110. 34-55, omitting 110,44 'asipatra o', 110.46 

anekayātanā-samsthāh ye nitā o', and treating 52-53 as one meotra and 54-55 as one mantra)15226, He should offer 19 pindas 

1522 a It sbould be noted that om is to be recited before each verse intended as maofra here and below. 

2522 b. The Tir C, (pp 290-292) sisghtly differs. It does sociude Vayu 110. 46 and treats tbe three verses (Vāyu 110 51-53) as one mantra It is difficult to understand why the writers of digests did not say that the śrāddhasodasi should be performed witb only 18 mantras from out of the 21 or 22 yerses with option to the reciter, Where the maatras exceed the number required, Jaumini X. 5 14 states teria a re facing farfare amarelo: Raghupandana reads the five verses (51-55) somewhat differeatly from the printed Vāyupurana, thoagh the sense is not much affected ,IV) Raghunandana's procedure of Gaya-śraddha 673 

of the size already stated and made of the material already mentioned with the sacred thread in the apasavya form. Raghu nandana explains that although there are nineteen pindas still this is called śrāddhasodaśī as a technical term,1573 It would be noticed that all the mantras refer to males in the words 'ye', 'te', 'tebhyah. So this is 'Pum-sodasi,' There is a strī-sodasi' also which only involves changing the words of the mantras in the masculine to words in the feminine gender as indicated in the Vāyuputāna itself. 1524 Otherwise there is no difference between the two (pumsodaśī and strisodasi ). The note belosy states the mode in which both males and females are to be invoked and gratified. 

Water should be sprinkled over all pindas three times with & vessel full of water mixed with sesame. The mantras repeated at the time are quoted below in the note, 1525 Then he prostrates himself on the ground and should dismiss (send away) them (the persons invoked) with the words 'O father and others 1 forgive me.' Then wearing the sacred thread in the savya form, he should sip water (perform acamana) and recite with his face to the east the two mantras (Vāyu 110.59-60 'sāksipaḥ santu," and 'āgatosmı Gayām'). If a pilgrim is unable to carry out all this lengthy procedure, he should at least offer pindas on Pretašilā, by making a sankalpa (like the one in note 1516 saying 'pindadānam' for śrāddham'). He should wear the sacred thread in the apasavya mode and repeat the verses in Vayu (110. 10-12 and 110.59-60) and should perform according to his sūtra the various iteros such as drawing lines on the altar meant for placing pindas, spreading kušas, sprinkling down water on the pindas, the offering of pindas, re-sprinkling

Then the pilgrim should descend from the hill (Pretašila) to the ground below and should bathe in the deep pool well known as Ramatirtha 1525 (which is in the form of Prabhāsa. hrada) at the meeting place of the great river (Phalgu) with the Prabhāsa bill after making a sapkalpa (as given in the foot note ) and after repeating the mantra 'janmāntarasatam' (Vāyu 108 18). He should then perform tarpana and perform śrāddha or (if unable to offer sraddha) offer only pindas accord. ing to the procedure of his own grupasūtra. He should offor as done in the Pretaśilā śrāddha twelve pindas to the father and the others, the siogle inexhaustible pinda and the sodasi pindas If he cannot go through all these,' he may perform any one of them. Then he should make a sankalpa and should offer obeisance to Rawa with the mantra 'Rama Rāma'(Vayu 108,20). When a pilgrim performs this bath, śrāddha and pindadāna kis pitrs become free from the condition of being preta (Vāgu 108. 21). Then he should perform obejbance to the refulgong Prabhāsesa (Siva). He should offer obeisance to both Rārar and Prabhāsesa with the mantra 'āpastyamasi' (Vāyu 108. 22) Then he should offer a balt of boiled rice to Yama with the words "this is a bali, om) bow to Yama.' Then on a hill called Naga situated to the south of Prabhāsa hill and on the middle of Prataśılā he should recite the verse 'dvau švānau' (Vāgu 108.30) and offer a bali made up of some kind of cooked food with the words 'this is a bali to Yamarāja and Bhramarāja (Dharma rāja?); salutation. This offering of bali is obligatory on every pilgrim); the rest may be done according to one's ability. This finishes the rites on the first day (i, e, the day of entoring Gayā). 

On the 2nd day of entering Gayā the pilgrim should bathio in Phalgu, perform his daily duty of tarpana and sorship of gods and then in the afternoon bathe in Brahmakunda 151 situated in the north-east corner which touches the root of Pretaparvata, that is at the distance of a gavyūti from Gaga and that (Brabmalcupda) is situated to the nortli-west of Gasā,

Then he should with the face to the south throw on Pretapar vata barley grains mixed with sesame with the mantra 'ye kecit" (Vāyu 110 63 g both by Tīr, C. p. 297 and by Raghunandana) and offer an añjali of water mixed with sesame with the mantra tā-brahma' (Vāyu 110-64).1528 

On the third day after entering Gayā come the rites of Pañcatirthi described above,(pp. 663-666). The pilgrim bathes 1529 in the Uttaramānasa with the mantra uttare mānase snānam' (Vāyu 111. 2-3). He should offer one añjali with the Terses (Vayu 110. 20-21) and perform śrāddha, After this śrāddha be sits to the south of Uttara-mānasa, spreads Kusas with tips towards the south, offers water with sesame and offers to all together one pinda of one handful of barley flour mixed with sesamo, kušas, honey, curds and water Then he bows to and worships the Sun's image on Uttaramānasa with the mantra 'namostu bhānave' (Vāyu 111 5). Then he repairs to Daksinamānasa in silence and there takes a bath in Udici tirtha, in Kanakhala and then in Daksinamānasa with the mantra (Vāyu 111 9-10) and then performs salutation and vorship to Daksipārka, then makes a bow to Maunārka, then goes to Phalgu tirtha situated to the east of Gadadhara and takes a bath and performs tarpana and śrāddha there; then be Worships Pitāmaha (with Vāyu 111. 19), visits Gadādhara and worships (with Vāyu 111.21), then again goes to the five tirthas, at each of which he bathes and performs tarpana Then he bathes the image of Gadadhara with pancāmrta. Raghu nandang notes that the bathing of Gadadhara with pancāmrta is obligatory, while the rest may be done according to one's ability. This finishes the rites of pañcatirthi,

[ Voi. nandana will alone be specified here. After bath and šrāddha at Matangavāpi, the pilgrim should go to Matangeša to the north of Matangavāpi and recite Vāyu 111, 25 (pramānam devatāh santū &c). When pouring water at the root of the mango tree established by Brahma the pilgrim repeats Vāya 111, 36 (āmram brahma-sarodbhūtam &c.). When boving to Brahmā, the mantra is Vāyu 111. 34 (namo brahmane &c.). The bali to Yama is offered with Vāyu 111, 38 (Yamarāja dharmarājau &c.). The bali to the two dogs is to be given with the mantra (Vāyu 111, 39) and that to the crows with Vāyu 111. 40 (Aindra-vāruna-vāyavya &c). As regards the padas the pilgrim should begin with Rudrapada and perform śrāddha there and then proceed to Visnupada and worship Visnu with five upacaras1530 with the mantra 'Idam Visnur-vi cakrame' (Rg. I. 22. 17). To the south of the vedi of Vispupada he should perform the śrāddhasodasi (described above pp 672-673) up to Vāyu 110, 60 (anrnosham-rpatrayāt). About an ascetic, vide above p. 655 

Then Raghunandana briefly touches upon the sraddhas to be performed at the several padas and remarks that the last śrāddha at the padas is that at Kasyapapada. He prescribes Vayu 11). 76 as the mantra for bath in Gadalola-tirtha. Then he states that the srāddha at the Aksayavata is to be performed on the north side of the Vata near ats bottom. He prescribes Vāyu 111. 82-83 (ekārnave &c ) as the mantras for bowing to the Aksayavata Further, he speaks of śrāddhas to be performed at several sub-tirthas, such as Gayatri, Sarasvati, Vikāla, the hermitage of Bharata, Mundaprstha. Then he prescribes that the pilgrim should cross the Vartarani (situated to the east of the Devanadi which is near Bhasmakūta) with the mantra (Vāyu 105.44, yāgau Vaitaradi nāma &c). After referring to several other tirthas such as Gopracāra, Ghrtakulyā, Madhu. kulya, Raghunandana recommends that the pilgrim should visit Pānduśılā (which is in Campakavana near Pitamaha) and perform sraddha there He notes that the four rivers and streams called Ghrtakulya, Madhukulyā, Devika and Mahānadi 1931 (Phalgu) are called Madhusravā when they meet the Sulā (Vāyu

112.30) and a bath, tarpana and śrāddha thereon yield immense results, Then are mentioned several other tirthas such as Daśāśvanedba, Matangapada, Makha-kunda (near Udyanta parvata), Gayāküta, Raghunandana winds up by providing that on Bhasmakūta the pilgrim should place with his right hand in the hand of Janardana a pinda mixed with curds (but without sesame) and on doing so recite five verses (Vāyu 108, 86-90, 1532 'eşa pindo maya' &c.). Then Raghunandana quotes *sixteen verses about Mātrsodası (which do not ocour in Vāyu 

purāna and are passed over here). 

We have to distinguish between Gayākgetra, Gayā and Gayāśiras or Gayāšīrsa. The Vayu, Agni and Nāradiya all assert that Gayāksetra is five krošas 1533 (in extent) and Gayā. śiras is one kroša. It had become the fashion to speak of famous tirthas like Kāśi and Prayāga as pañcakrosa. But so far as the Vāyupurāna is concerned the Gayāksetra is about 13 miles in length from Pretašilā to Mahābodhi tree as shown above Gayā is said to be two krošas and a half in extent in all directions from Mundaprstha 1534, Gayāśiras is smaller than Gayā and is identified with Phalgutīrtha (vide note 1499). Gajā and Gayasiga (Pāli for Gayāśirsa) are well known to ancient Buddhist texts (Mahāvagga I 21. 1 in S. B. E. XIII p. 136, Anguttaranikāya, toxt vol IV. p. 302). Vide n. 1510 

Four of the most important and holy tirthas have been dealt with at some length so far. It is not possible in the space allotted to the section on tirthas to pursue the same procedure as regards other famous tirthas. It is proposed to devote a few pages to each of half a dozen or more tirthas and then to give a somewhat comprehensive list of tirthas with a few references in the case of each. But before proceeding further reference must be made to certain popular groupings of tirthas. There is a group of seven cities that are deemed to be very holy and

KURUKSETRA (25 miles east of Ambala) is a very sacred tract, the history of which is lost in the mists of anti quity. In the Rgveda X.33.4 there is a reference to a king Kuruśravada, son of Trasadasyu.1538 The Atharva-veda men. tions a Kauravya husband (probably a king) who had a talk with his wife 2539 In the times of the Brāhmadas Kuruksetra had become a very holy land. The Sat. Br. (IV. 1, 5.13) narrates the legend that the gods performed a sacrifice in Kuruksetta and at first excluded the two Ašvins from any share in it (S. B. E vol. 26 p. 275). The Maitrāyani Samhita (IL. 1. 4., dova yai sattramāsata Kuruksetre) and the Tai, Br. (V. 1. 1., devā vai sattram-asata tesām Kurukgetram vedir-āsīt) also say that the Gods performed a satira in Kuruksetra. The idea underlying these passages appears to be this. The Vedio people of the Brāhmana period held yajñas to be the dharma par ercellence, as stated in Rg. X. 90. 16 (yajñena yajñam-ayajanta devāstānı dharmāpi prathamanyāsan). Kuruksetre was the centre of Vedic culture in the Brahmana period and sacrifices must have been performed there un a large scale. Hence it was called dharmaksetra and as gods were supposed to have attained their position by what men believed to be dharma (vajña, tapas &c.) it is stated that gods performed sattras in Kuruksetra, The sams Brahmapa mentions & Kauravya king Bablika Pratipiya (XIL 9.3.3, S. B, E, vol. 44 p. 269). The Tsi. Br. (I 8.4.1) ipforms us that the Kuru-Pañcālas went towards the east in winter (Śzbira) and to the west in summer which was the worst season. The references in the Ait. Br. are far more instructive, The legend about Kavasa in which Sarasvati helps the sage has already been referred to above (p. 559 n. 1254). The Ait. Br. (8.1 or I 19) calls that place, where Sarasvati came rushing, 'Parisaraka'. In another place the Ait, Br, tells us that in its time Nyagrodba (Ficus India) was called Nyubza in Kuru

ksetra.1540 Elsewhere the sit. Br. speaks of the countries of the Kurus and Pañcālas together with the Vaša-Usinaras (38. 3-VII. 14). The Tai Ā, narrates 1541 that the gods performed 8 sattra and Kuruksetra was their altar (for the sattra). The southern side of that Vedi (1. e. Kuruksetra) was Khandava, the northern side was Tūrguna, the hinder part was Paridab, and the country of Maru (desert) was the rubbisa pit. This shows that Khāndaya, Türghna and Paridab were border parts of Kuruksetra and the Maru district was somewhat away from Kuruksetra. The Srautasütras of Ašy. XI 6, Latyāyana X. 15 ft and Katyāyana 1542 24 6 5 ff closely follow Tāndya and other Brāhmanas and mention several holy places at which parts of the Sārasvata sattras were performed such as Plaksa Prasravana where Sarasvati starts, the Vaitandhaya-hrada of Sarasvati, the tract called Parinah in Kuruksetra, Yamunā flowing through the country of Kārapacaya and the country of Triplaksāyaharana, 

In the, Chandogya Upanisad (I. 10.1 ff) occurs the story of Usasti Cākrāyana who, when the Kuru country was struck by hailstorms, lived with his very young wife in Ibhyagrāma and went begging for food, 

The Nirukta (IL. 10) explains that 1543 Devāpi and Santanu mentioned in Rgveda X, 98.5 and 7 were historical persons and were brothers, sons of Rstisena, a king of Kuru. Panini (IV. 1. 151 and IV.1 172) explains the formation of the word Kaurarya from Kuru', the first in the sense of 'apatya', the second in the sense of 'king, '1544

History of Dharmasastra 

[Vol. The Mahabhārata frequently speaks of the high sanctify ing virtues of Kuruksetra. It appears that the territory to the south of Sarasvati and to the north of Disadvati was included in Kuruksetra and 1545 that those who resided thorein were as if residents of paradise. Kuruksetra appears to be called Brabmīverta in Vanaparva 86.6. According to the Vāmanapurāpa, Kurujāngala is 1546 the country bettyeen the Sarasvati and Drsadyati, wbile Manu (IL 17, 18) defines Brahmāvarta as the country created by God between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drsadvati, states that Brahmarsi, deśa which is slightly less (in koliness) than Brabmāvarta comprises Kuruksetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcala and Sūrasena. From these passages it is clear that Brahmavarta is the holiest country in Aryavarta and that Kuruksetra was almost like it; we have seen that in the times of the Brab manas the most sacred Sarasvati flowed through Kuruksetra and that the place wbere Sarasvati disappeared in the desert was called Vinaśana and was itself a very holy place, Origi mally the land called Kuruksetra is said to have been the Vedi (sacrificial altar ) 1547 of Brahmā, then it came to be called Samantapañcaka (or syamanta-in some passages) when Parašn rāma made five pools of the blood of ksatriyas in royenge for his father's murder, which were subsequently turned into holy pools of water by the blessings of his pitrs and lastly it came to be called Kuruksetra whea king Kuru, son of Samyarada! ploughed the land with a golden plough for seven krošas all round. Kuruksetra is so called after king Kuru. Kuru is said

to have asked of Indra the boon that the territory he ploughed might be 'Dharmaksetra' (domain of righteousness) and that those who may bathe or die there may reap a rich harvest of merit 1549 The war between Kurus and Pāndavas vas fought there. It is spoken of as 'Dharmaksetra' in the opening verse of the Bhagavad-gīta. Kurujāngala is said to be a very fit country for śrāddha in Vayu (77, 93) and Kūrma II 20. 33 and 37. 36-37. In the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang speaks of the country, the capital of which was Sthān visvara (modern Thanesat which is the heart of Kuruksetra) as the 'land of religious merit' (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I p. 184). 

The extent of Kuruksetra is said to be five yojanas in radius (in Vanaparva, and the Vamana Parāda) 1550. A some what corrupt verse occurs in the Mahabhārata and some purānas 1551 about the limits of Kuruksetra viz. the territory between Tarantu and Karantuka and between Macakruka (image of a yaksa) and the Rama-hradas (pools made by Para surāma)- this is Kuruksetra, Samantapancaka and the nor thern vedi of Brahmā. The result is that Kuruksetra is referr. ed to under various names viz. Brahmasaras, Rāmahrada, Samantapancaka, Vinasana, Sannihati (vide T. Pr. p. 463). For the boundaries of Kuruksetra, vide Cunningham's A S. R. of India, vol. XIV pp 86-106 where he notes that Kuruksetra was 30 miles to the south of Ambala and 40 miles to the north of Panipat. In the remote past Kuruksetra was the centre of

History of Dhar maśāstra 

[Vol. all the activities and the culture of the Vedic people. Gradually the Vedic people spread towards the east and south and the country between the Ganges and Jumgā and later on Videha (or Mithila) became the centres of Indian culture. 

For reasons of space it is not possible to dwell at length on the greatness and sanctity of Kuruksetra as described in the Mahābhārata and the Purānas Vanaparva 83 starts by say ing that all beings that are in Kuruksetra are freed from all sins and that he also who always says 'I shall go to Kuru ksetra, and I shall reside in Kuruksetra' is freed from sins 1552 *In this world there is no place holier than this. Even the particles of dust driven from Kuraksetra by the yind take a great sinner to the highest goal' 1553 Even the Ganges is com pared to Kuruksetra (vide note 1324 'Kuruksetrasama Gapgā"). The Naradiya avers 1534 that planets, constellations and stars are subject to the danger of falling down (from the sky) in course of time, but in the case of those that die in Kuruksetra there is no falling on the earth again (i e, they would not be born again). 

It is a remarkable fact that though the Vapaparya 10 chap. 83 enumerates several tirthas on the Sarasvati and 10 Kuruksetra, they do not at all tally with the tirthas mentioned in the Brāhmabas and the Srautasütras (except Vinasana which is mentioned in Vanaparra 83.11 and probably Saraka which may be identified with Parisaraka of the Ait, Br.). This means that the Panaparva account of Sarasvati and Kuruksetra is later by some centuries than that in the Srautasūtras, The Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 65 ) names about one hundred tirthas in Kurukse tra. It is - not possible to get out all of them, But a few words may be said about some of them. First comes the lake called Brahmasaras or Pavana-hrada (Vanaparya 83. 85, Vāmana 49. 38-41, Nāradiya, uttara 65 95) on

The Vamanapurāpa (2%. 50-55) describes it at soine length and says that it was half & yojana in extent. Cakratirtha (mentioned by Vāmajapurana 42.5, 57. 89 and 81. 3) is popularly supposed to be the place where Krsna took up the discus for attacking Bhisma, Vyāsas. thali 1555 (named in Vanaparva 84 96, Nāradiya, uttarardha 65. 83 and Padma I 26. 90-91) is the same as modero Basthali, 17 miles to the south-west of Thanesar where Vyāsa resolved to'die on the loss of his son. Asthipura (Padma, Adi 27, 62) is on the west of Thanesar and south of Aujasa ghāt where the bodies of the warriors killed in the Great Bhārata var vere cremated. Cunningham in Archaeological Survey Reports of India vol. II. p. 219 states that Cakratirtha is the same as Asthipura and that in Alberuni's time it was the most famous shrine in Kuruksetra. Prthūdaka on the Saras. vati is very highly spoken of in Vanaparva 83, 142-149. "They say 1556 that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is holier than Kuruksetra, that the sacred spots (on Sarasvati) are holier than the river Sarasvati and that Prthüdaka is bolier than all the other tirthas on Sarasvati. There is no tīrtha that is better than Prthūdaka'. The Salyaparya1557 remarks that whoever, while intently engaged in repeating holy texts, abandons his life at Prthüdaka on the northern bank of the Sarasvati vould not be troubled by death next day (i, o, he would be free from birth and death) The Vamanapurana (39.20 and 23) calls it Brahma yopitirtha. Pithūdaka is modern Pehova in the Karnal Dist. rict in Panjab, 14 miles to the west of Thanesar. Vide E.I. vol.

In the Salyaparva (chap. 38) it is said that the world is encom passed by seven Sarasvatis, then they are enumerated and their locations are specified viz. Suprabhā (in Puskara, where Brahmā engaged in a great sacrifice remembered her, verse 13), Kāñcanāksi (in the Naimisa forest, v. 19), Vibāja (jnvoked by Gaya in the Gayā country, verses 20-21), Manoramā (in Auddalaka's yajña in Uttarakosala, verses 22-25), Surenu (in Rsabhadvipa in Kuru's yajña, verses 26-27), Oghayati (called by Vasistha in Kuruksetra, verses 27-28), Vimalodā (when Brahmā again performed a yajña in the Himalaya). In the Vāmanapurāra 34, 6-8 geven rivers in connection with Sarag. yati are said to be very holy (but nine are actually enumerated) viz, Sarasvati, Vaitarani, Apagā, Ganga-Mandakini, Madhu Brava, Ambunadi, Kausiki, Drsadyati and Hiranvati, 

Kuruksetra was also called Sannihati or Sannihalyā. Vide those words in the list of tirthas. The Vāmanapurāna (32, 3-4) says that Sarasvati springs from a plaksa tree, that after pier cing many hills it enters Dvaitavana. Vāmana (32. 6-22) "contains a eulogy of Sarasvati by Mārkandeya. Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I. p. 261) states that the river Sarasvati falls into the sea at the distance of a bowshot east of Sompāth. There is a small but holy stream called Sarasvati, that rises in the - Mahilanthe hills and after crossing the south-east corner of Palanpur Agency passes by Siddhapura and Patan, flows under. ground for some miles and then enters the Runn of Cuick (Bom, G, vol.

Antiquity of Mathurā to rest on firm ground. It is stated in the Anguttaranikāya 

(I. 167, skam samayam ayasmā Mahākaccano Madhurāyam' viharati Gundāvane) and Majjhima (IT. 84 same words) that Mahakaccāyana, a famous disciple of Buddha, assiduously preached in Mathurā the principles of his Master. Megas thenes appears to have known Mathurā and its connection with Heracles 1558 (Elari-Krsna?). The word "Māthura' (meaning a resident of Mathurā, or born in or coming from Mathura) occurs in Jaimini's Pūrva-nimānsā-sūtra 1559 Though Panini's sūtras do not expressly mention Mathurā, the latter is included in the Varanādi-gana (Pān. IV. 2. 82), Pānini is, however, aware of Vasudeva and Arjuna (IV. 3, 98), the Andhaka and Vrsni clans of Yadavas to which Krsna belonged (IV.1. 114) and probably knew the name Govinda (IIL1. 138 and vārtika 'gavi ca vindeh sanjñāyām"). Mathurā is several times mention ed by the Mahābhāsya of Patañjali who 1560 in a famous passage refers to dramatic representations, paintings and stories which depict the destruction of Kamsa by Vasudeva, He also cites a quarter of a verse about the killing of Kamsa by Vasudeva as a well-known past event. Whether the town Saurya mentioned in the Mahabhāsya on Vārtika 2 on Padini L. 4,7 (Sauryam ca Ketayatā ca Saurya-Ketavate) is the same as Mathurā is doubtful, even though the Uttaradhyayanasūtra speaks of Mathurā as Sauryapura (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 112). The Adiparva (221. 46) indicates that Mathura was famed for excellent cows 

1558. Vide McCradle's 'Megasthenes and Arrian' p. 201 where it 18 said that Heracles was held in special honour by the Saurasepoi tribe (Sūrasena) which possessed two large cities, Mathura and Kleisobora (Krsnapura?), wbile Ptolemy calls at Nodoura of the gods' (vide Mc Criadle's 'Ancient India as described by Ptolemy', ed, of 1927, p. 124).

When Hamsa and Dimbhaka, brave command ers of Jarāsandha, drowned themselves in the Jumnā and when Jarasandha sorrowfully went to Magadha Krspa gays 've shall again joyfully reside in Mathurā* (Sabhāparva 14. 41-45), Ultimately Krsna is said to have left Mathura owing to the constant attacks of Jarasandha and established the Yādavas in Dvāraka 1561 (Sabhāparva, 14. 49-50 and 67). The Brabma purāna, on the other hand, states that the Vrspis and Andha kas on the advice of Krsna loft Mathurā through the fear of KalayavanaVide also Vi. V. 23. 8-15. The Vayu (88.185) states that Satrughna, the brother of Rāma, killed the demon Layana, son of Madhu and established Mathura in Madhuyana while the Rāmāyaba (Uttara-kānda 70. 6-9) informs us that Satrughna took twelve years to make Mathura a fine and pros perous city, , In the Ghata-Jātaka (Fausböll, vol. IV. pp. 79-89 No, 454) Mathurā is called Uttara Madhurā (to distinguish it from Madhurā of the Pārdyas in the south) and the story of Kamsa and Vasudeva is narrated, which differs in some material points from the Mahābhārata and the Purānas. In the Raghuvamsa XV.28 it is mentioned as Madhurā and as founded by Satrughna. Hiouen Thsang states that in Mathura there'existed in his day three stūpas built by Asokarāja, that there were in Mathurā five Deva temples, 20 sanghūrāmas (Buddhist contents) with 2000 Buddhist priests (Beal's B. R. W, W. vol. I p 179 ). James Allan (in Catalogue of the coins of Ancient India' 1936, p. CXVI) states that the coins of the Hindu kings of Mathurā cover the period from the begin ning of the 2nd century B. C to the middle of the first century B. O, For some ancient coins from Mathurā, the Cambridge History of India, vol. I, p. 538 and plate V (No. 5-10) may be referred to, 'An interesting and informative work is 'Mathura' by FS.

Inscriptions on Mathurā 

689 

Inscriptions of suoh Kuşāna rulers as Kaniska, Huviska and others relating to Mathurā have been published of which the following may be mentioned: Inscription on a Naga image at Mathurā of 'Mahārāja-rājātirāja Kanikkha' in samvat 8 (E 1. vol. 17. p. 10) 1563; the Mathurā pedestal Inscription of Kaniska in the 14th year (E. I, VOL. 19 p. 96); inscription on the pedestal of the image of a seated Bodhisattva at Mathura in the reign of Huviska in sainvat 33 (E I vol. 8 pp. 181–182); Inscription of & king Vāsu (rest of the name lost) of the year 74 (E. I. vol. 9 p. 241) and of the time of Sondāsa (E. I vol. 9 p. 246); seven Brahmi inscriptions from Mathura and its vicinity (E. I. vol. 24 pp. 194-210) There is further an interesting inscription recording the dedication of a stone slab in the temple of Nagendra Dadhikarna by Nandibala and other sons of some actor (Šailālaka) brothers of Mathurā (E. I. vol. I, at p. 390). From the Visnu-purāna VI. 8. 31 it follows that an image of Hari had been installed in Mathura before that purāna was composed, The Vayupuçāpa 1564 informs us in a prophetic vein that seven Naga kings will rule over Mathurā, Prayāga, Sāketa and Magadha before the Guptas. Alberuni's India (vol. I, p. 147) states that Maharā (Mathurā) is crowded with brāhmanas, 

From the above brief historical sketch it would appear that Mathurā was, five or six centuries before Christ, a flourish ing city where the epic Hinduism prevailed, that later on Buddhism and Jainism dominated it, that there must have been a revival of Hinduism under the Nāga and Gupta emperors, that in the 7th century A. D., when Hiouen Thsang wrote, Hinduism and Buddhism were equally prominent and that in the 11th century A. D. it was completely dominated by the Brahmanic faith. 

The Agnipurāna furnishes the strange information that Bharata at the command of Rama killed three crores of the sons of Sailūsa in the city of Mathurā 1565. Mathurā has been

History of Dharmaśāstra the centre of Krsna worship and of Bhagavatism for over two thousand years. The Vazāha-purāpa devotes about ong thou Band verses to the greatness of Mathura and its sub-tirthas (chap. 152–178). The Brhan-nāradiya, chapters 79-80, Bhāga vata X and Visnu-purāna V-VI devote much space to Krsna, Radhā, Mathurā, Vrndāvana, Govardhana and Krsna's exa ploits there. 

Hor want of space only a few verses about Mathurā will be set out here. The Padma (Ādikhanda 29. 46-47) says "Yamunā gives mokse when united with Mathurā; Yamunā gives rise to great merit in Mathurā and when united to Mathurā it bestows devotion to Visnu'. In the Varahapurāna (152, 8, 11) Visnu gays "There is no place either in the nether regions or on the earth or in mid air as daar to me as Mathura, Mathura is a famous ksetra of mine that confors muldi; no place is to me higher than it. It is my birth-place and it is lovely, oom mendable and dear to me'. The Padma says 'Mathuraka is a name extremely dear to Vispu'. The Harivemša contains a fine description of Mathurā, one verse from which may be quoted hore 'Mathuri is the hump (1 a. the most eminent spot) of Madhyadeśa, it is simply the abode of the goddess of wealth, it is the horn (1. e. the most prominent part) of the earth, thera is nothing like it and it is endowed with abundant wealth and agricultural produce : 1566 

The tract round about Mathurā is said to be 20 yojanas in extent and the city of Mathura was in its midst 1567. The Varahapurāna and the Nāradiya (uttarārdha) chapters 79-80 mention numerous tirthas in and about Mathura. It is not possible to enumerate them here. A few important ones will be noticed briefly. Both Varāba (chap. 153 and 161 6-10) and Nāradiya (uttarārdha 79. 10-18) mention twelve forests near Mathurā viz. Madhu, Tāla, Kumuda, Kāmaya, Bahula, Bhadra, 

(Continued from the last page) actor Has this anything to do with a dispute between the followers of Bharata, the reputed author of the Natyasastra, and other actors? The Natyasastra chap. 17. 47 (G.0.5) prefers the dialect of Sūraseda for dramas, Vide my 'History of of Sanskrit Poetics' P 40 (1951).

Khadira, Mahāvana, Lohajangha, Bilya, Bhāndita and Vrndāvana. There are also 24 upavanas enumerated by Growse on 'Mathura' (p. 76) which are not mentioned by the Purānas but only by later works. Yrndāvana 1568 was to the north-west . of Mathurā on the Yamunā and was five yojanas in extent (Vispupurāpa V. 6. 28-40, Nāradiya, uttarardha 80. 6,8 and 77). It was the scene of Krsna's adventures and love-making The Padma IV. 69 9 speaks of it as a portion of Vaikuntha on the earth. The Matsya (13.38) identifies Radha in Vrndāvana as Depi Dāksāyan),1569 In Kālidāsa's day it had great fame. In Raghuvamsa VI, wbile describing Susena of the Nipa family, king of Sūrasena, Vrndāvana is said to be no less charming than Caitraratha, the park of Kubera (verse 50). Then there is the Govardhana 1570 hill, which Krona lifted up on his little finger to afford shelter for seven days to the cowherds and their cattle against the heavy rains sent down by Indra (Vispupurāna V.11. 15-25). It is stated in the Varābapurana (164 1) that Govardhana is about two yojanas from Mathura to its west. This appears to be tolerably correct as at present it is 18 miles from Vrndāvana. The Kūrma (I. 14 18) says that the very ancient king Prthu performed austerities here. The details given in the Hari-yamsa and the Purānas are sometimes confused and misleading. For example, in the Harivamsa (Vispuparya 13.3) it is stated that Tālavana is to the north of Govardhana on the Yamunā, while it is south-east of Govar dhana Kālidasa refers to the caverns of Govardhana (Raghu. vamga 6. 51). Gokula is the same as Vraja or Mahāvana, where

1569. Dey (p. 42) regards the identity of the modern Vrodzvada which is only 6 miles from Mathorā (10 the opposite direction to Gokula) with the ancient Vrndiyana described in the Parānas as extremely doubtful on several grounds, the most cogeat being that cocient Vrndāvana and Mathurā appear to bave been situated on opposite sides of the Yamuna, while modern Vrodāvans and Mathura are on the same side of the river But the references be gives for this last statement viz Vissuporāna 5 18 33 and Bhagavatapurāna X. 39. 34 do not in my opinion bear out what he says, The Nāradiya (II, 80 6-7) appears to say that Vrodzvana is near Govardhana and along the Yamunā and Naddigrāma

History of Dharmaśāstra 

I Vol. Krsna was brought up in his early childhood by Nand-gopa who removed his habitation from Gokula to Vrndāvana out of fear of what Kamsa might do. The great Vaisnavite saint Caitanya visited Vrndāvana (Caitanya-caritāmrta canto 19 and 9th Act of the drama Caitanyačandrodaya, both by Kapikarna pūra or Paramānandadāsa). In the 16th century Vrndāvana became a centre of Caitanya's bhakti movement owing to the strenuous efforts and learned writings of the Gosvamins of Vrndāvana, particularly Sanatana, Rūpa and Jiya. Vide Prof. S, K, De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' (1942) pp. 83–122. Vallabhācārya, who was a contemporary of Caitanya founded new Gokula, one mile to the south of Mahapana in imitation of the ancient Gokula. Caitanya and Vallabhācārya met at Vrndāvana (vide Manilal O. Parekh's work on Vallabhācārya p. 161). The old temples of Mathura met the game fate at the orders of Aurangzeb as the temples of Banaras, 1572 

The Sabhāparva (319. 23-25) narrates that Jarasandha threv his mace from Girivraja (Rajgir in Bihar, the ancient capital of Magadha) and it fell in Mathurā at the diatance of 99 yojanas before Krspa and the place where it fell vag thence called Gadāvasāna, I have not come across this name anywhero else. 

Growse describes in chap. IX pp. 222 ff. the templos of Vindāyana and in chap. XI Govardhana, Barsān, the birth place of Radha, and Nandgaon. Vide also 'Picturesque India' by W, S Caine pp. 253 ff. for Mathurā and neighbouring holy places, 

PURUŞOTTAMATIRTHA (JAGANNATHA) 

Much has been written about Purusottamatirtha or Jagan. nātha, both in Sanskrit and in English. The following works in English may be consulted by those who desire to make a thorough study of the sacred place; W, W. Hunter's 'Orissa' 

1571, Vide Elliott and Dowson's 'History of India as told by its own historians' vol. VII D. 184, where a passage from the "Ma-Asr i-Alamgirl' is trapslated to the effect that "Aurangzeb commanded the destruction of the Hindu temple at Mathurā known by the name of 'Debra Kesa Rais (which according to that work had been built at a cost of 33 lakhs of rupeesj sad soon that strodghold of falsehood was levelled with the ground and on Be same spot was laid the foundation of a vast mosque."69$

Purusottamatirtha 

Vol. I pp. 81–167, Rajendralal Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa' Tol I pp. 99–144, R. D Banerji's 'History of Orissa' (in two volumes, 1930), Gazetteer on Puri, vol. XX pp. 409-412, 

There are four most important tirthas in Orissa, viz. Bhuvaneśvara (or Cakratītha), Jagannātha (or Sankha-ksetra), Konarka (or Padma-ksetra), Yajpura or Jajpur (Gadaksetra). The first two are still held in high esteem, while the last two are altogether neglected. 

Among the Puranas, Purushottania-tirtha is extensively dealt with in the Brahma (chap. 41-70, about 1600 verses), in the Brhannāradiya (uttarardha chap. 52–61, 825 Terses). Among digests, the Tirtha-cintamani of Vācaspati that devotes nearly one-third of the work to Purusottama-tirtha (pp. 53– 175) and that quotes about 800 Verses from the Brahmapurāna on Purusottama, Raghunandana's Purusottama-tattya (which is brief and mostly based on the Brahmapurāna) and the Tirthaprakāśa (pp. 561-594) may be mentioned. It is worthy of note that the Kalpataru (composed about 1110-1120 A, D.) does not describe Purusottama-tīrtha in its Tirthakanda. though it speaks of a few little known tirthas like Lohārgala. Stutasyāmin and Kokāmukha. 

Raghunandana in his Purusottama-tattva quotes a verse1572 (which as printed is corrupt) from the Rgveda that from the context appears to be addressed to some evil spirit (alaltsmi) and means 'O evil spirit with a vioked looking chin (or that art difficult to be killed)! Have recourse to that far-off wood in the sea, that has no connection with human beings and go to distant lands with it'. Then he states that the Atharva Veda has a similar verse. Probably following Sāyapa's inter

This interpretation is natural and suits the context very well I could not trace the verse in the Atharvaveda

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. pretation, Raghunandana conneots this Rgveda verse with Purusottama, the image of which is made of wood, 

It would be proper to set out as briefly as possible the story of Jagannatha contained in the Brahmapurana. In Bharatavarsa there is a country called Ondra situated on the shores of the southern ocean, which extends northwards from the sea up to Viraja-mandala 1873 (chap. 28. 1-2). In that country there is a holy place, destroyer of sins and bestower of mukti, surrounded on all sides by sand and ten yojanas in extent (chap. 42. 13-14). There is the famous shrine of Puruso ttama in the country of Utkala the whole of which is very holy owing to the favour of the all-pervading Jagannātha (chap. 42. 35-37). Men who reside in Utkala are blessed like gods since Purusottama resides there. Chapters 43 and 44 narrate the story of Indradyumna who ruled at Avanti (Ujjayini) in Malaya (modern Mālvā). He was a very pious, lebrned and good king who after reading all Vedas, šāstras, epics, puranas and Dharmaśāstras came to the conclusion that Vasudeva was the highest Deity, started from his capital Ujjayini with a vast army, servants, priests and artisans and came to the shores of the southern 80a, saw the ksetra of Vasudeva, ten yojanas in breadth and five yojanas in length and encamped there, Formerly there was a Vata tree on the shores of the southern sea near which there was an image of Purusottama or 1974 Jagan. matha made of sapphire, which became embedded in sand and was concealed by creepers and plants. King Indradyumna per formed Aśyamedha there, erected a great temple (prāsāda) and was anxious to establish a suitable image of Vāgudeva in the temple. In a dream the king saw Vasudeva who told him to go alone to the shore in the morning and cut the Vata tree grow ing just on the water line with an axe, The king did go in the morning and then two brahmadab (who were really Visnu and Visyakarmā) appeared, Vignu told the kaing that his associate (Viśyakarma) will manufacture the image. Three images of Kropa, Balarama and Subhadrā were made and given to the king and Vispu further conferred the boon that the pool called

Story of Indradyzimna 

695 

Indradyumna (where the king bathed at the end of his Aśra medha) will be known by the king's name, that whoever took a bath once in it would go to Indraloka, and that whoever offered pindas on the bank of the pool would save 21 ancestors of his family. Then the king established the three images in the temple built by him. 1575 The Skandapurana contains a Puruşottamamāhātmya in a sub-section called Utkala-khanda in its section Vaisnava-khanda, where the story of Indra dyumna is given with some variations. 

Stripping this story of the supernatural, it appears probable that the holy place Purusottama was called Nilācala in very ancient times, that Krsna worship was introduced from Northern India at that place, and that three images of wood were established in comparatively early times. It may be stated here that in the Maitrāyani Upanisad 1576 an Indradyumna is named among a host of cakravartins. The Kūrmapurāna (II. 35, 27) makes a brief and colourless reference to Purusottama (tīrtbam Nārāyanasyāngat-Dāmanā tu Purusottamam). Rajendralal Mitra ('Antiquities of Orissa') surmises that there were three periods in the history of the Purusottama-ksetra, viz. early Hindu period, the Buddhist period and the Vaisdava period (after the 5th century A. D. when Buddhism began to wade). He notices that from about the 7th century A. D. consi derable temple records on palm leaves exist, but that the temple records for the Buddhist period are untrustworthy (p. 104) and that there are indications that Puri was probably a place of Buddhist sanctuary (p. 107). The indications of the existence 

1575. Vide Hooter's Onssa vol. I, pp. 89-94 for a somewhat differ. ent account based on Kapılasambitā, the most important poiats of which are that Visgu shows to Iodradyomna as His image a log of wood thrown up by the ocean, that the images were being fashioned by the divine carpenter, that it was ordered that no one was to see them till they were ready and that in spite of this, the queen insisted on seeing them when they had been' chiselled only up to the waist and when only stems stood in the place of the arms for the images of Krsna and Balarama, while the image of Subbadrā had no arms at all. The present images are to this day in the same condi tion. The images are described by Rajendralal Mitra 1a 'Antiquities of Orissa' II. pp 122–123. The story of the occurs in CT4911°, 3A 52 41-93, 53-57, 58, 1-21, 60-61, et agrees very closely with the.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. of Buddhism in Oriasa are the existence of Asoka's rock ediots on the Dhauli Hill (O.I.I. vol. I pp. 84–100), the existence of many caves of the Buddhist period on the Ihandagiri range about five miles to the west of Bhuvanesyara, the procession of the car of Jagannatha which resembles the procession of Buddha's Tooth relic as described by Fa Hien (Hunter's Orissa, Vol. I. p. 131-132) and the three cruda wooden images of Krspa, Subhadra and Balarama which are hardly found anywhere else and which correspond to the tāres peculiarities of Buddhism viz, Buddha, Dharma and Sapgha. Vide Mitra'a 'Antiquities of Orissa, vol. II. pp. 122-126 (where he gives wood-cuts showing the figures of the images and comparing them with Buddhist symbols and Cunningham's 'Ancient Goography of India' pp. 510-511 (the remarks in which appear to me far-fetched). In J. R. A, S. vol. 18 at p. 402 (new series) Sewell things that the celebrated image of Jagannatha was originally one of the Trišülas or developed Taurus symbols. 

At present the sacred enclogure of Jagannātha is a square surrounded by a massive stone wall 20 feet high, 652 foot long and 630 feet broad with 120 temples containing various forms of God, 13 being temples of Siva, some more of Parvati and a temple of the Sun, This clearly shows the catholi city of Jagannatha, Almost every form of Hindu faith is represented here. Even the Brahmapurāna gives expression to this tolerant view when it says that the holy Purusottama ksetra forbids all the wranglings between Saives and the devotees of Visnu, 1976a The great Pagoda of Jagannātha bas four chambers, the first being the Hall of Offerings (bhoga mandira ), the 2nd the pillared hall for music and dance (the nata mandira), the third the audience hall where pilgrims, asserable (the Jaganmohana mandıra) and the 4th the inner sanctuary.

Temple of Jagannatha 

697 

temple is situated at the distance of about seven furlongs from the sea shore and stands on a mound about 20 feet above the level of the surrounding ground, the mound being dignified by being called Nīlagiri (the blue hill ). There is a large gate-way on each side of the enclosure, that on the east being the most magnificent On each side of the entrance there is a colossal crouching lion and hence the door-way is called simha-dvāra (lion gate ). 

There are certain peculiar features of the great shrine of Jagannātha In the first place, in the court of Jagannātha and outside the Lion Gate no distinction of caste 1578 is observed Jagannatha is the god of all people. The second special feature is that the holy rice cooked as offering to Jagannātha is regard ed as so sanctified that all barriers of caste are transcended, so much so that a Parī priest will receive the holy food even from 

a low caste Hindu. The feeling is that cooked rice when once placed before Jagannātha never ceases to be pure. Hence the Wahāprasāda is dried, is taken to all parts of India and at the periodical śrāddhas among Vaisnavas a grain of this holy rice is invariably put on the cake as the most sacred article that can be offered to the Manes (vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. I 199). The third special feature of Jagannatha is the car festival (rathayātrā) which is the most important of the 24 high 1578festivals at Puri. The festival is described at length by Hunter in his 'Orissa', vol I pp. 131-134. The car festival starts on the 2nd day of the bright half of Āsādha. The car of Jagannatha is about 45 feet in height, 35 feet square and is supported on 16 wheels of 7 feet diameter with 16 spokes and has Garuda as a crest; the 2nd car is that of Subhadrā, which is a little smaller than Jagannātha's car, resting on 12 wheels with 12 spokes in each and having a padma (lotus) as a crest, the 3rd car is that of Balarama resting on 14 wheels with 14 spokes in each wheel and has Hanūmān for crest. The cars are drawn by pilgrims and hired labourers from the temple to 

1578 Hunter 18 Orissa' (vol. I. pp 135-136) notes that only 21 classes and castes (including Christians and Mabomedans) are excluded, they being mostly flesb-eating and animal-life destroying castes Even the washerman and the potter whom Hunter includes in the list are allowed to enter the outer court.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. the country-house of Jagannātha (which is about two miles Away) amidst the shouts and emotional songs of thousands of pilgrims, Owing to the references in English literature to the cor of Jagannatha it is supposed by many that pilgrims used to throw themsolves before the car in a religious frenzy and were killed. But there is hardly any truth in these suppositions. Thoro might have been a fer accidental deaths. Hunter in Orissa' (vo). I pp. 133-34) scouts this idea of suicide under the car and Rajendralal observes (in 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. p99) No Indian divinity bas & mors unenviable notorioty in English Literature than Jagannatha. It is certaio, neverthe loss, that human conception has never realized a more innocent and gentle divinity than Jagannatha and the tenets of his votaries are the very reverse of sanguinary or revolting. Never was opprobrino more unjustly cast on an inoffensive object than in this instanoe and none merited it less'. On the 10th day of the bright helf begins the return of the car from the country house, 

According to Rajendralel Mitra the oldest temple in Puri is that of Ajabukeśvara built by Lalatondu Kesari (629-677 A. D.), the builder of the tower of Bhuvanesvara; the next oldest is Mārkandeśvara and next comes the great temple of Jagannatha (vol. II. p. 112). Manmohan Chakravarti in his paper on the date of Jaganpāthe temple in Puri' (J. A. S B., Vol. 67 for 1898, part 1 pp. 328-331) quotes two verses from the Gangavainsa copper platss of Orissa which state that Gange śvara alias Codaganga built the great temple of Purusottama 1579. As Codaganga's coronation took place in sake 999 (i 6. 1078 A, D.) according to M. M. Chakravarti, he put forward the view that the prāsāda of Jagannātha was built about 1085-1090 A. D. Dr. D. C, Sirkar (in "God Purusottama at Puri' J. O, R., Madras vol. 17 pp.: 209-215) points out that the celebrated Oriya Chronicle Mādalā-pāñjā attributes the construction of Purusottama Jagannātha not to Codaganga but to his great grandson -Ananga-bhima III, who also installed an image of Purusottama in a temple at Vārāpasi-Kataka (modern Cuttack)

which was desecrated by Sultan Firuz Shah ( vide Elliot and Dowson's 'History of India', vol II. pp 312-315). These Ganga kings built magnificent temples at Bhuvaneśvara (ancient Ekāmra), Konārka and Purī, which are the finest surviving speci mens of North Indian Hindu Architecture. Mitra ('Antiquities of Orissa 'yol I. pp. 109-110 ) and Hunter (Orissa' vol. I pp. 100-102 ) note that Ananga-bhīma wanted to eclipse the grand tower of Bhuvanesvara and renovated the temple of Jagannatha in šake 1119 (i. e. 1198 A D ). 1580 

The temple of Jagannātha has an arnıy of attendants They are divided into 36 orders and 97 classes. At the head was the Raja of Khurdha who called himself the 'sweeper of Jagannatha'(vide Hunter's 'Orissa', vol I p 128 ). 

As in Banaras, so here also there are five important tirthas, 1531 viz. the pool of Mārkandeya, the Vata tree (identi fied with Krsoa), Balarama, the sea and Indradyumna pool A few words may be said here about each. The story of Mārkandeya is narrated in Brahmapurāda, chapters 52-56 and in Nrsimha-purāna 10.21 ff (briefly ). In chap. 56. 72-73 Vişnu asks Mārkandeya to build a temple of Siva to the north of Jagannātha and to construct a sacred pool which thence forward was to become known as “Mārkandeya's pool'. The Brahmapurāna provides that the pilgrim should bathe in Mārkandega's pool, dip his head thrice, utter a mantra (chap, 57. 3-4), then he should perform tarpana, go to the temple of Siva (called Mārkandeyeśvara ) and worship him with the Mülamantra 1582 viz. 'Om namah Sivāya', then with another mantra called Aghora and a Paurāpic mantra, The pilgrim should, after a bath in Mārkandeya's pool and visit to the temple of Siva, repair to the sacred Vata, circum-ambulate it

It may be noted that the Brahmapurāna 157 17 expressly states that the Vata is Vispu Himself in that form (Dygrodhakrtikam Vispum pradipatya ). The Vata is also styled Kalpayrksa (Brahma 57. 12, 60,18). The pilgrim should boy to Garuda standing in front of Krspa and then worship Krsda, Sankarsada and Subhadrā with mantras. The mantras for Sankarsada are verses 22-23 of Brahmapurāna chap. 57 and that for Subhadrā is chap. 57. 58 1584 The mantra to be used in the worship of Krsna is either of 12 syllables (om namo bhagavate Vāgudevāya) or of eight syllables (om namo Nārāyapāya). Brahmapurāna chap. 577 verses 42-51 specify the various rewards of seeing Krsna with devotion and wind up by promising moksa 1585 A bath in the sea at Pari is always commendable, but particularly on the Hull Moon day (Brahma 60. 10). Brahma chap. 6% deals at length with the bath in the sea (the whole of it except one verse being quoted by Tir. C. pp. 126-128). The Indra dyumna pool has been mentioned above (pp. 694-95). The pilgrim has to bathe in the Indradyumna pool, perform tarpana for gods, sages and piirs and offer pindas to his ancestors (chap 63. 2-5). 

In the Govindapur stone Inscription of the poet Gangadhara (E. I Vol. II. p. 330 ) of sahe 1059 1 e. (1137-38 A. D.) there is a clear reference to Purusottama 158 

The Brahmapurana chap 6G speaks of the Gundicāyātra for seven days on the bank of the Indradyumna pool in a mandapa where reside (temporarily ) Krsna, Sankarsana and Subhadra. The Tir. O. which quotes the whole of that chaptor (pp. 157-159 ), calls it Gundikā, while in the drama Caitanya

candrodaya 1587 it is styled Gundicā at the very beginning. It appears that Gundicā is the summer house of Jagannātha about two miles from the great Temple, The word is probably derived from gunds, which means a thick log of wood in Bengali and Uriya {vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. pp. 138-139) and has reference to the legend of a log of wood that Indradyumna found floating in the sea. 

It may be noted that religious suicide at Purusottama is referred to in Brahmapurāda: 1588 those who give up their body (life) in Purusottama-ksetra after mounting up the Vata tree or do so between the Vata and the ocean reach without doubt moksa. A man abandoning life, either intentionally or unintentionally, either on his way to Purusottama or in the cemetery or in the country house (of Jagannātha ) or in the streets (of Jagannātha ) or even anywhere else there secures moksa. Therefore men desiring moksa should by all means give up life at that holy place'. 

The Brahmapurāna winds up by saying it is thrice 1569 true that that ksetra (Purusottama) is the greatest and highest

The great Vaisnaya saint, Caitabya, settled permanently at Puri in 1515 A, D. at the age of thirty and spent eighteen years there till 1533 (when he died). He appears to have made a great impression on the Gajapati kipg Prataparudra deva, ruler of Orissa (1497-1540 A, D.). In the drama Caitanya candrodaya of Kavikarnapüra the king is shown to be so anxious for meeting the saint that he declares that he would die if the gracious glance of the saint did not fall on him.1990 This should be attributed to the inveterate habit of gross exaggera tion rampant in most Sanskrit writers, particularly ainongst devotees and followers of great saints, Caitanya came to be worshipped along with Visou as a deity in Pari and Orissa (vido Hunter's 'Orissa' vol. I. p. 109). Kavikarpapūra in his drams (8th Act) makes Sārvabhauma say that there is no distinction between God Jagannātha and Caitanya, the only difference being that Jagannatha is 'dārubrahma' (Godhead manifested in a wooden image) and Caitanya is 'narabrahma' (Godhead in human form ). 1591 The Caitanyacaritāmrta (a poem) of Kavikarpapūra in cantos 14-18 deals with the devotional and ecstatic life of Caitanya at Puri and presents & vivid picture of Ratha and other festivals of Jagannatha in which Caitanya took a prominent part, I agree with Dr. S. K. De that there is no satisfactory evidence to show that Pratānarudra was actually converted into the new faith (Vaisnava faith and movemont in Bengal' p. 67). 

One regrettable feature of the great temple of Jagannatha is the existence of some obscene and lascivious sculptures that disfigure the walls of the temple and the presence of dancing girls with rolling ayos, to which pointed reference is made by all writers, particularly European ones (vide, for example, Indian Antiquary vol. I. p. 32%, Hunter's 'Orissa', vol. I pp. 111, 135). The presence of dancing girls is a legacy from tho past.

NARMADA 

Next to the Ganges the most sacred rivers of India are the Narmada and the Godāvarī. A few words about each of these may be said here, 

An express reference to the Narmadā has not so far been traced in the Vedic Literature. The Satapatha Br. (XII 9 3.1) refers to one Revottaras who was a Dātava Cakra and sthapati (a chief) and whom the Srõjayas expelled (SBE TO). 44 p. 269) 1893, Ravā is apother name for Narmadā 1594 and it is possible to say that Revottaras was named after Revā A. vārtika on Dān. IV. 2. 87 derives the word Mahismat (as the name of a country) from "Mahisa'. This is generally identified with Māhismati (on the Narmada). So the name Narmada was probably known to the author of the Vārtikas (about the middle of the 4th century B. C) The Raghuvamsa VI. 43 speaks of Māhismati as the capital of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i e. Narmadā). 

The Narmadā is frequently mentioned in the Mahābhārata and some of the Purāņas. The Matsya (chapters 186–194, 554 Verses), Kūrma (Uttarārdha, chapters 40-42 verses 189), Padma Ādıkhanda (chap 13-23,739 verses, most of which are the same as in the Matsya) deal with greatness of Narmadā and the tirthas thereon 1594. The Matsya (194, 45) and Padma (Adi khaoda 21. 44) state that from the place where the Narmada falls into the sea up to the Amara-kantaka mountain (where it rises) there are ten crores of sacred places, while the Agni purāpa (113. 2) and Kūrma II, 40. 13 raise the number to 60 crores and 60 thousand The Nāradiya ( uttarardha chap 77)

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. says (verse 1) that there are 400 principal tirthas on both banks of the Narmada, but from Amara-kantaka three crores and a half (verses 4 and 27-28). 1595 The Vanaparva (in chap 188 103 and chap. 222.24) mentions the Narmadā along with the Goda vari and other rivers of the south. In the same parra (chap. 89. 1-3) it is stated that the holy Narmada is in the Ānarta country 15%, that it is endowed with priyangu creepers and mango groves, that it has strings of Vānira fruit, that it flows to the west and that all the holy places in the three worlds come for a bath to the Narmadā. The Matsya and Padma declare 1597 that the Ganges is holy in Kanakhala, the Saras vati jn Kuruksetra, but the Narmadā is holy everywhere whether in a village or in a forest and that the Narmadā purifies the sinner by its very sight while the waters of the Sarasvati do so by three baths (on three days), of the Yamunā (by baths) in seven days and of the Ganges by a single bath. The Vianu dharmasūtra (85.8) in enumerating a list of tirthas that are eminently fit for śrāddha includes the banks of the Narmadā throughout the whole length among them. The Narmada is said 1598 to have started from the body of Rudra which is a poe tic way of saying that it rises from Amarakantaka that is said to be the abode of God Maheśvara and his spouse (Matsya 188 91). The Vāyupurāna declares that the holy Narmadā, the best of rivers, is the daughter of the pitis and the śrāddhas offered on it become inexhaustible 1599. The Matsya and Kūrma both say 

1595. Though ter and THET are generally used as synonyms it is found that the w ayrut 1a V 19 18 coumcrates them separately (anyt tar INI THET) and the guv (13,25 and 29-30) states that thc Hava springs from Frey and ET from 197€ HTUT una terre ATYTI FER Eurat TETET ata Fiat Freio (5) 77,27-28, vido Dote 1268 above for similar eulogy of the Ganges. 

1596 Ābarta appears to be the ancient name of Gujarat and Kathawar together. In the Udyogaparva Dvārakā is called Agarta-nagari (7.6) As Narmada is said to lay through Ānarta it must be supposed that in the times of the Great Epic Quarta iacloded both sonthera Gujarat and Kathiawar,

that the river Narmadā has a course of complete 100 yojanas and its breadth is two yojanas 1660. Prof. K, V. Rangaswami Aiyangar seizes upon the length of 100 yojanas and says (on p. 199 note 4 of his edition of Kalpataru on Tirtha in G. O, S.) that the Matsya is very accurate, since the length of the Narmada is now found to be about 800 miles. But he forgets that the breadth is said to be two yojanas (i.e. 16 miles on the scale for a yojana adopted by him). It is not shown how and where (except at the mouth if at all) the Narmadā is 16 miles in breadth in its long course. Both Matsya and Kūrma state that the Narmada is (rises) from Amarakantaka which is to the western side of the country of Kalinga 1601 

The Visnupurāna provides that if a man repeats day and night and whenever he has to go inside a dark place the mantra 'Salutation to Narmada in the morning I salutation to Narmadā at night! O Narmadā) salutation to you; save me from poisonous serpents' 1602 he has no danger from serpents. 

It is stated in the Kūrma and the Matsya that a man who commits suicide by entering fire or water or by fasting (on some of the tīrthas on the Narmadā or on Amarakantaka) does not return (to this samsāra).1603 

The Narmada is mentioned as Namados by Ptolemy (p. 102). One of the earliest inscriptional references to it occurs in the Eran stone pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in 165 of Gupta era i. e. 484-85 A, D, Vide C. I. I. yo). I, at p. 89. 

Several rivers are mentioned as falling into the Narmada such as Kapila (on the south bank, Matsya 186. 40, Padma I, 13. 35), Vīšalyā (Matsya 186. 46 = Padma 1, 13, 35-39), Erandi (Matsya 191, 42-43, Padma I. 18. 44), Iksu-nādi (Matsya 191. 49, Padma I. 18.47), Kaveri (Matsya 189. 12-13,1604 Padma I 16.6).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Voli Many sub-tirthas are enumerated, out of which two or three may bo nientioned here. One is Maheśvara-tirtha (1. e. Omkāra) from where Rudra is said to have burnt down with an arrow the three cities of Bānāsura (Matsya 188,2 ft, Padina I 15 2 ff), Sukla-tirtha (highly praised in Matsya 192.3 ff about which it is said that the rājars Cāpakya 1605 attained perfection there), Bhrgutirtha (at the very 1608 sight of which a man becomes free from six, a bath in which leads to heaven and death at which ensures non-return to sainsara ), the Jamadagnya-tirtha (where the Narmada 1607 falls into the sea and where Lord Japārdana secured perfection). The mountain Amarakantaka is a tīrtha that dispels all sins including brahmana-murder and it is one yojana all round in extent (Matsya 189. 89, 98). The most important place on the Narmadā is, however, Māhismati, about the exact location of which scholars have differed. The general consensus of opinion is that Mābismati is to be identified with Omkāra Mandhata, an island in the Narmadā about 40 miles south of Indore. It has a long history. Moggaliputta Tissa is said in Buddhist works to have sent missionaries to several countries in the reign of Asoka (about 247 B O.), one of which was sent to Mahigamandala. Dr. Fleet in his paper · Mabisa. mandala and Māhismati' (in J, R. A. S. for 1910 pp. 425-417) assigns cogent reasons for identifying Mahigamapdala and Māhismati. Māhismati was well-known to the Mahābhasya, 188 from a passage in which it follows that by a forced march & person starting from Ujjayini could reach Māhismati the next morning. Kādidāsa describes it as surrounded by Revā (Raghuvamśa VI 43). Mākiemati is mentioned as being on

GODĀVARĪ 

No mention of Godāvari has so far been found in the Vedic Literature. In Buddhist works there are traditions about Bavari, who was & purohita of Mahākosala and then of Pasenadi, who resided in Assaka's territory in the vicinity of Alaka on the Godavari and who is said to have sent several disciples to Buddha at Srāvasti (vide Suttanipāta, S. B, E, vol. X part 2 pp. 184 and 187). The Vārtika 'Sankhyāyā nadī-godāyari bhyām ca' on Pān. V, 475, expressly mentions Godavari and has in view 'Saptagodāvara'. The two Epics and Purānas contain numerous references to it. The Vanaparya 1609 mentions it as a holy river in the south, abounding in gardens and full of water and resorted to by hermits performing austerities. The Aradyakanda of the Rāmāyana (13.13 and 21) speaks of the country well-known as 'Pancavati' frequented by herds of deer which is near the Godavari and about two yojanas from Agas tya's hermitage. It is in the Brahmapurāna that the Godāvarī and the subsidiary tirthas on it have been lauded at great length in chapters 70–175, The Tirthasāra (a part of Nrsimha prasāda ) quotes about 60 verses from chapters 89, 91, 106, 107, 116-118, 121, 122, 128, 131, 144, 154, 159, 172 of the Brahma pusāda, which fact shows that the chapters on Gautami in the present Brahmapurāna, were part of the Brahmapurāna at least some centuries before 1500 AD.

[Vol, tirthas on it, 1611 Dandakāranya is said to be the seed (source or cause) of dharma and multi and the country embraced by the Gautami is specially the holiest 1612 A verse ocourring in several purānas states "These countries (of Madhyadeśa) are immediately next to the mountain Sahya: thereon is Godavarī and that country is the most charming in the whole world, There is Govardhana there which is (like) Mandara and Gandhamadana'. 1613 Brahmapurana (chapters 74-76) narrates how Gautama brought the Ganges from the matted hair of Siva to Brahmagiri where he had his hermitage and how Ganesa helped in the task by means of a ruise. The Nāradapurana (uttarārdha 72) narrates that no rain fell for 12 years while Gautama practised tapas, that owing to famine all sages came to Gautama's hermitage, that he brought Gangā to his hermi. tage, that he sowed śāli grains in the morning and reaped the crop by midday, that this went on till there was plenty of rain and crops, that Siva appeared to him, that Gautama prayed that Siva should stay near his hermitage and that hence the hill on which Gautama had bis hermitage came to be called Tryambaka (verge 24). Varāha (71. 37-44) also says that Gautama brought Jābpayi to Dandaka and the river became Godāvari, The Kūrma (II. 20. 29-35) mentions a long list of rivers and other sacred places and winds up by saying that the Godāvari is pre-eminently & place for performing śrāddha. It is stated in the Brahmapurāna that for the removal of all kinds of distress two alone are declared (as the means) viz. the holy river Gautami or Siva who is full of compassion, 1614 The Brabmapurana describes about a hundred tirthas on the Godavari, such as Tryambaka (79.6), Kušāvarta (80, 1-3), Janasthāna ( 88. 1), Govardhana (chap. 91), Pravarāsangama

Nasik must have existed at least 200 years before Christ. An Inscription on one pillar of the railing at Bharbut stupa (about 200 B.C.) records the gift of Goraksitā of Nasik, the wife of Vasuka, 1616 This is the earliest certain historical reference to Nasik discovered so far. The Mahābhāsya 1617 speaks of Nasikya as a city. The Vāyu purāna (45.130) mentions Nāsikya as a country. The Nasik Inscriptions in the Papąulenā capes (Bombay Gazetteer Vol. 16 pp. 544-639 and E. I vol. VII pp. 59-96 edited by Senart) establish that Nasik was a prosperous place in the centuries before and after Christ. Ptolemy (about 150 A, D.) mentions Nasika (Ptolemy p. 156). It is not possible for rea sons of space to go into the detailed history of Nasik, its bath ing places and pools, its temples, pilgrimages and rites of vorship. For these one may consult the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. 16 (for Nasik District). That volume states that there are about 60 temples in Nasik (pp. 503-512) and 16 in Pancavati and one the left bank of the Godāvarī (pp. 512 ff). But hardly any really old temple has survived. In 1680 A. D. twenty-five temples at Nasik vere destroyed by the Decoan Viceroy of Aurangzeb Almost all the large temples that adorn Nasik were built during the tinies of the Peshwas of Poona (1750 1818). Three temples are specially vorthy of mention, viz, the the Rāmji temple in Pancavati and Nāro Shankar's temple (or Bell temple) on the left bank of the Godavari near the first crossing and that of Sundar&-Dārāyana in Aditwar Petk at Nasik (p. 503).

Jupiter is in Leo for one year once in twelve years. Crowds of pilgrims throng at Nasık in their thousands from all parts of India in the simhastha year, 

KANCI (modern Conjeeveram). Kāñci is one of the seven holy cities of India (vide p. 678 n. 1535 above) and one of the most ancient towns in southern India If we rely on the tradition recorded by Hiouen Thsang who stayed in Kāñci about 640 A. D. it would follow that Buddha frequented the region around Kañcīpura and that Kāñcī had a stripa about 100 feet high built by Aśokarāja (Beal's B. R. W, W. vol. I. p. 230 ). Hiouen Thsang informs us that Kāñci was 30 lt (or about 53 miles) in circuit, that in his day there vere eighty Deva temples and that there were many heretics called Nirgranthas (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II. pp. 228-229 ). The next important daturn is the mention of Kāāci-puraka (resident of Kancīpura) in the Mahābhāsya on Vārtika 26 to Pan, IV. % 104 (Kielhorn, vol II. p. 298 ). Several early records relating to the ancient history of the Pallavas of Kāñci (of about 250 to 350 A. D.) have been published, such as the Mayidayolu plates of Yuyamahārāja Siya-skandavarman (E. I. vol. VI p. 84), the Hirahadagalli Inscription of the 8th year (E. I vol. 1. p. 2), and the Talgunda Pillar Inscription of Kadamba Kākusthavarman (E. I vol. VIII p. 24). The

Allahabad Prasasti of Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions ed, by Tleet p.7) states that Samudragupta vanquished Visnugopa, king of Kanoi (Kāüceyaka), in the first half of the 4th century AD. In the 'Manimekhalai' there is an elaborate description of the town of Kāñci where Manimekhalai ultimately attained to enlightenment (vide S, Krishnaswani Aiyangar's "Mani mekhalai in its historical setting' p. 20). It is not necessary for the present purpose to refer to the numerous inscriptions about the Pallavas and Kāñci and the large number of papers contributed to learned Journals. Reference may, however, be made to the careful and scholarly work 'History of the Pallavas of Kāñci' by R. Gopalan (1928), which brings together all rolevant data published up to the date of its composition, 

Let us now turn to some passages from the Purānas about Kāñci. The Brahmānda agsertg. 1623 The two cities of Kāśı aod Kāñct are the two eyes of Lord Siva; Kanel is a famous Vaisnava hsetra but it also brings about the presence of Siva'. It is stated in the Bārhagpatya-sūtra (III. 124) that Kāñoi 18 a Sākta-ksetra and in the Devibhagayata (VIL 38, 8) it is said to be a Devisthana called Annapurna. The Vamana-purāna 1614 observes: the Jāti is the best among flowers, Kāñcf the best among towns, Rambha among women, the householder among persons of (the four) aśramas, Kuśasthali is the best among cities and Madhyadeśa among all countries, 

Kāñcī is full of temples and shrines. The most famous are the Vaikuntha Perumal temple of Visnu and the Saiya temple of Kailāganātha built by Pallava Rājasimba. This latter has a large hal supposed to contain 1000 coluinps,2625 There is an old Jaina temple also.

On the materials so far available it is difficult to decide when the shrine of Vithoba was established, but there is sufficient evidence to enable one to say that it was certainly in existence in the middle of the thirteenth century A. D.1626 The Padmapurāna (Uttara-khanda 176, 56-58) mentions the image of Vitthala Vispu on the bank of the Bhimarathi which has only two arms and is called Bindu-madhara. The difficulty is about the date of this part of the Padmapurāna. In my opinion it is a late addition and cannot be placed earlier than about 1000 A. D. The modern town of Pandharpur lies along the right bank of the Bhimā river. The chief temple in Pandharpur is that of Vithobā in the centre of that part of the town which is considered holy. The Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20 describes at some length (pp. 417-424) the main temple of Vithoba and its adjoining parts. Behind the temple of Vithobā is the temple of Rakhumal, the consort of Vithobā. There is a large staff of priests and attendants in the temple of Vithobā, the chief of whom are those called Badges (who are the most numerous body of the staff and who once claimed to be owners of the temple, but who are now held to be the trustees and guardians of the temple pro perty and of the god's jewels under a scheme of management framed by the High Court of Bombay),1627 Except the Badyes all

other attendants are called sevādhāris and they are of various grades, vix, the pujāris ( who take the principal part in the worship of the God), Benarıs 1628 (who repeat mantras and hymns at different services), paricāralas (who bring in a large silver disl the water with which the pujāri washes the image of the God and brings the lamp for waving it before the image at the evening and night services), haridus (who sings generally five Verses in honour of the god at the morning, evening and night services), the dingres (who hold a mirror before the God at the early morning service after the god has been dressed and before the lights are waved), the diutés (the torch-bearers) who hold a lighted torch when the last night ceremonies are over and carry the slippers of the god in torch-light processions three times a year on the Full Moon days of Asādha and Kārtika and on the Drsū night), the dange (who stands with a silver or gold plated mace outside the ants-chamber at the morning, evening and night services). The goddess Rakhumāi has only one set of priests known as Utpāls, of whom there are over a hundred families, 

The Bombay Gazetteer describes at length (pp. 427-430) the ordinary and special services in the temple of Vithoba which are passed over here. Their essence is that the god is treated as if he were some high human person requiring bath, dress, songs, sleep against fatigue and so on. One thing, hov ever, may be noticed that no women singers or dancers are connected with this temple of Vithobā in contradistinction to many temples in the Decoan and South India, 

The image of Vitthal or Vithoba in the temple is about three feet and nine inches high and together with its base seems to be cut out of one block of trap. Its rough appearance is probably due to the effect of time. The image is standing with its arms alambo and hands resting on the hips; the left hand holds a conch and the right a cakra (discus). On the image are carved but 80 slightly as to be hardly noticeable except on close examination a waist cloth and round the waist a waist-band the end of which hangs on the right thigh. The ornaments con sist of a necklace and in the long ears are ear-rings which touch the shoulders. On the head is a long round-topped cap. Mr.

Vithobā Image at Pandharpur 

715 

Kantak, the rriter of the pote on Pandharpur in the Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20, remarks (p. 424): “The dress and ornament of the image belong to a (time) little later than the Guptas, probably not later than the 5th or 6th century after Christ. As far as is known no other existing Vaisnava temple in India has an image of Vispu like the Pandharpur image, but there are two similar images of the third century after Christ in the Udayagiri brahmanical caves Dear Bhisā. .... . Like the Pan- . dharpur image these are both standing figures with arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips and a conch and discus in the hands". Formerly pilgrims used to embrace the image and also touched the feet of the image. But since about 1873 the feet alone are allowed to be touched. 

The Bombay Gazetteer (vol. 20 r. 431, note 2) states that the image of Vithoba was removed to various places at diffe rent times to save it from sacrilege by fanatic Moslem invaders and rulers. About 500 yards east of Fitkoba's temple in the bed of the Bhimā river is the temple of Pundlik, one of the most favourite places of worship in Pandharpur, This last temple is not that of a god. It only marks the spot where Pundlik, a great devotee of Vitthal, spent his last days and died. Pundlik was probably a brāhmada fronu Pandharpur, originally an undutiful son who ill-treated his parents, but who later repented on seeing the dutifu] cobbler Rohidās, changed his ways and became a very dutiful son, so much so that tradition says that god Vithobā came to visit him. Vithobā apd Pundlik have become so much coupled together that all pilgrims before beginning to dine and on other occasions shout the cry *Pundalika parade Hari Vitthal' 1629, The Bom. G. rol 20 (pp. 432-134) describes the temple of Pundlik and narrates the traditional story about him 

1629. The uniter ia Bom G. vol 20 translates the words yes t e e Form as 'O' Pundalika, grant os e boon, Hari Vitbal”. This trapslation does sot appear to me to be correct. The cry is also in the form 'goditi PIETER SE {sbich is the correct one) In my opinion Fam is only a vocative and the correct form is qui tet (for est) and the whole cry means 'O Hari Vitlial? that didst grant a boon to Pondalla'.

The river Bhīmā is styled Candrabhāgā within Pandharpur limits and its water is believed to possess sin-purifying power. 

Several important and controversial questions arise in relation to Vithobā's temple at Pandharpur; vix, the date whon the image of Vithobā was installed in the temple at Pandharpur, whether the present image is an old one or & substitute, what the ancient name of Pandharpur was, the derivation of tho word 'Vitthal'As regards the first question it may be stated that there is not enough evidence to establish with certainty the time when the image was established 1630 But some of the items of evidence may be briefly set out here. In I A. vol, 14 Pp. 68-75 Prof. K. B. Pathak published an inscription on a coppor plate found at Bendigere (about eleven miles south-east from Belgaum), the inscription being dated in šale 1171 (1249 A.D), in which Pandharpur is called Paundarikaksetra on the Blinna rathi (at p. 74) and Vithoba is called Vigpu and which records the grant of a village in Venugrāna district (Belgaum) to number of brāhmadas by a minister of Yadava king Krsno (or Kaphara in the inscription) in the presence of god Visnu (n. 74) i. e. before the image of Vispu or Vitthala. Dr. R, G Bhandarkar in. 'Vaisnavism, Saivism &c, (p. 88) and in 'History of the Deccan' (2nd ed. p. 115-6) refers to an inscription on stone dated sake 119% (1270 A, D.) in Pandharpur itself, in which Bhanu, son of Kosava, is represented as having performed the Aptoryāma sacrifice in Pandurangapura 'on account of which crowds and Vitthala were greatly pleased. There is another earlier inscription in the temple of Vithobā on three sides of a stone beam in a sopā beyond the mandapa (porch) of 16 millars, - the script being Devanagari and the language being partis Sanskrit and partly Canarese. It was issued in sale 1159 (1237 S.

made the heart of sage (muna) Pundarika expand (with devotion). Vide Bom. G. vol.' 20 pp. 419-420 and pp. 4-6 of Mr Khare's monograph' (on medieval references). The Mysore Archaeo logical Survey Report for 1929 (pp. 197--210) publishes a copper plate inscription issued by the Rāstrakūta king Avidheya which records a grant of Pāndaranga-palli and four other villages situated to the east of Mabādeva hill to a brābmada named Jayad-vittha. This grant was confirmed about 820 A. D. by Rastrakuta king Sarvarasa (i. e. Amoghavarsa. I). The editor Dr. Krishna is of opinion that the date of the inscription must be 516 A D. (and. p 203). Therefore the important con clusion follows that Pandharpur was known to Canarese people as Pandarage and was also called Pandarangapalli. This in scription does not expressly refer to god Vitthala, but the donee's name Jayad-vittha contains the part Vittha which is most probably an early form of Vitthala.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

tVol ists on the southern bank of the river Bhaimi and there is also a rare but fine image there; it is called Paundarika ksetra and the greatest of gods viz. Panduranga worshipped by the whole ksetra resides there. It is three times holier than Puskara, six and ton times holier than Kedāra and Vārānasi respectively. Pundarīka practised severe austerities at the end of Drāparayuga in the 28th Kalpa and always devotedly attended upon his parents. God Krsna who was making a herd of cows graze on Govardhana hill became pleased with him for his devotion to his parents, Krsna who wields & stick for driving cows, who has bracelets rendered bright by (the colour) of the umbrella 1633 (shade), who is adorned with a head-gear (mukuta) and a skya ( a loop ) scintilating with the lustre of many jewels, who was very charming and had armlets studded with jewels, who does not appear to ) wear any dhots, but has his loins covered with nickers, who is set off by a girdle of three strings tied on his waist and who stands with arms akimbo and appears possessed of three lines on his belly. Though a ms. of the Tirtha portion of Hemādri's work has not yet been recovered, there is no reason to doubt that the verses were taken by Gopālācārya from Hemādri's work, particularly when almost all those verses are quoted by the T. S. (about 1500 A. D.) from the Skandapurāna and Kūrmapurāna. As Hemādri composed his work about 1260 to 1270 A. D. and as the verses quoted by him are cited from the Skandapurada, it follows that several centuries before 1260 A. D. Pandharpur was known as a tirtha, that the devotee and saint Pupdarika (Marathi 'Pupdlik') also was so known then and that the image of Vithoha was essentially the same in appearance as it is now. That Pandharpur had risen in sanctity and importance in the 15th century follows from the fact that both the great Vaispava saints, Caitanya and Vallabha, visited it Vide Prof. S. K. De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' p.71 for

Caitanya's visit and 'Sri Vallabhacharya' by Manilal C. Parekh (pp. 56-59 ) for Vallabhācārya's visit, 

It has been already shown from the Bombay Gazetteer that there is a tradition about the image having bgen removed several times and brought back. On pp. 16-25 of his work. Mr. Khare cites various passages from medieval writers in Sanskrit, Marathi and Canarese and comes to the conclusion that the present image is not only not the ancient one but that it was not there in the 17th century, since the characteristics of the present image do not tally with the description contained in the poems of saint Tukārām. I do not agree with his conclusions, He has overlooked several weighty considerations. He has relied upon inferences drawn from the presence of Afzulkhan and the bigoted emperor Aurangzeb in the Deccan. I have cited above (pp. 63%, 692) references to the demolition of North Indian temples and images on the orders of Aurangzeb, but Mr. Khare has been unable to show any direct reference to the demolition of the temple or the image of Vithoba on the orders of any Moslema king or officer,1634 We cannot rely on mere inferences or not properly authenticated letters or verses. Besides, the present image is so much worn that unless one yery carefully 

1634. It may, however, be stated that there is some evidence that efforts were made to demolish the temple of Vitboba by some Moslem Ling of Bidar and that the Badves ( the guardians of the Panchari temple ) fearing destruction of the image removed it and concealed it somewhere else. In a Narātbi work called HECTERETETTET EE, by Mr. Narayan Krishna Gadre (1905) p 168 verses are cited from a life (completed in sabe 1667 I e 1745 A D ) of one Chāngā Madhesa ( who died 12 šake 1427 i e 1505 A.D.) written by his descendant Shamji Gosāvi Vaõjarkhede (wbo was 11th in descent from Changa Mudhesa) The Marathi verses are; पदरीचा राजा वामणी पातशहा। ब्राह्मणासी यह छळियलें। हिंदधर्म जितुके तितके वर्जियेले। राज विध्वसिलें पढरीचे केलीसे मशीद महाद्वार मोडुन ! सातमास पूर्ण झाले यासी।

Therefore, there is great scope for diferences of opinion on the characteristic features of the present image. Conceding for argument that the tradition about the removal of the idol is we, that does not establish that the present image is djšerent from the one that existed in the 13th century or before. The present image has an elongat ed Lead dress Thica some may construe as a simple mukuta (Crowa) with a rim: but the pajāris and com.non people regard it as a Sirajižga and the rim as the rope of the ši? 10 that is carried on the back ( by conherds ) The present image has ear-rings (as Mr. Khare admits) but they are so long that the rest on the sooulders The prezent image has angadas (armlets) on the upper arms (and that is the description in the Skanda-purāna quoted by Herradri) The presens image has ornaments on the wrists (Thich the passage irom the Skandapurana also mentions). There is a girdle vrith three strings on the waist of the present image (in Se also se bate * trittenāpukālena kapibaddhena or bagibandheng rajitaḥ'). The present imaga 55 does not clearly show that a dhoti was torn (and therefors one reading of the Standa says that it is 'digtāsā) ') bar the Skazda adds that the image has arms akimbo. In my opinion the description in the Skanda parāba (which must be held to be at least zot later than about 1000 A.D.) tallies in essential particulars with the present image: tberefore it 201oys that suficient eridence has not been adduced to show that it is comparatives a bev image and the proposition of Mr. Share that it is a different one from the original should be held not proced.

But Tukarām į does mention the facts that the arms are akimbo, that there is no dhoti (digambara), and mentions the existence of a skya, a stick, also a girdle and ornaments. Lastly,, Mr. Khare does not attach sufficient importance to two facts, one being that about 1873 two Gosavis damaged the image which was later re-installed and pilgrims were forbidden from embracing it. It is quite possible that some of the features already indistinct were lost in these happenings (vide Bom, G. vol. 20 p.430). Besides, for hundreds of years the image has been washed with pazīcāmsta (will, curds, ghee, honey and sugar) and water at least once every day and sometimes several times a day. It is not difficult to imagine that the characteristic marks became blurred by these continual baths. 

Some other matters require to be dealt with. The image is variously called viz. Panduranga, Pandhari, Vitthal, Vitthalanātha and Vithobā. 

Vispu assumes in Prakrit the forms Vinhu, Vinnu, Venhu, Vetha and others. In Canarese Visnu becomes Bitti, Bittiga, Vitta &c. The changes in names do not necessarily follow the rules laid down in Prakrit or Canarese grannars, which rules themselves are often based on meagre data and Mr. A K, Priyolkar in his learned paper on 'Bhagat Namdeo of the Sikhs' in the Journal of the University of Bombay vol. VI part 2 (1938) points out (p. 24) that in the Ādi Granth of the Sikhs, in the hymns of Namdeo, God is addressed as 'Bithal' or 'Bitbalu' (p. 24), that, in the Gujarati poems of Narsinh Mehta and Mirabai, God is addressed as Vitthala (p 35) and Vitthala is employed by these saints meaning only Visnu and not the deity at Pandharpur. The learned Kāśinātha Upadhyaya, author of Vitthala-rn-mantrasāra-bhāsya, derives the word Vitthala as (Vit+thatla) 1636, 

As regards the name of the ksetra it appears that origi nally it was called in Canarese Pandarage, of which Pāndu ranga is & sanskritized form. When Pundlik, the devotee of Vitthal, became famous the sacred place came to be called Pundarikapura (as in Kūrma) and Paundarikapura (as in Skanda). Vide note 1632 above

** History of Dharmaśāstra - 

[Vol. The pilgrims to Pandharpur may be divided into two classes, regular visitors and occasional visitors. The first clasa comprise those called Vārkaris (lit those who keep the fixed times). The Varkaris ars of two sorts viz those who attend overy month and those who attend twide a year (on the 11th of Asadha-sukla and Kārtika-sukla), This cult of vārkaris has been a greater leveller. In theory and to a large extent in practice it ignores caste exclusiveness A brāhmans vārkari falls at the feet of a südra vārkarī. There are certain obser vazces binding on' all vārkaris (for which, vide Bom, G, vol. 20 p. 471). The vārkari carries ā rosary of Tulasi (basil) beads, foregoes' flesh-eating, observes a fast on ekādaśī, carries an ochre-coloured patākā (swallow-tailed banner) and is to speak the truth (and not to cheat) when engaged in his daily occupations. 

Some people think that the image of Vithobā is really Buddhist or Jain. There is hardly any evidence for this. When such Marathi poets and saints as Ekanatba, and Tukarām speak of Vithobā as Bauddhāvatāra they have Visnu in mind, 1637 whose 9th avatāra was Buddha according to the Puranas and medieval writers. . 

The question of the attitude that modern Hindus should adopt towards holy places and pilgrimages will be briefly dealt with at the end of the next chapter on the list of tirthas.

CHAPTER XVI - - LIST OF TĪRTHÁS 

This is merely a list of tirthas from the point of view of Dharmaśāstra and not a treatise on the Ancient Geography of India. The result is that many countries and towns that have no importance or claims as tirthas have been altogether omitted. Bauddha and Jain works on tirthas have only rarely been referred to Many of the Puranas enumerate the moun tains and rivers of drīpas and ursas other than those of Jambudvīpa and Bhārata-yarsa such as Harivarsa, Ramyaka. varsa, Krauñcadvipa, Salmalidvips, but they have been exclud ed from this list. The Brahmapurana (chap. 26 verses 8-83) contains a string of over 520 tirthas without hardly any certain indication of their location and the Bhismaparka in chap. 9 mentions about 160 rivers with practically no indication about their location in most cases Similarly, the Garuda (L. 81, 1-31 ) enumerates about 200 and Padma (VI. 129) contains 108 tirtha names. In Banaras alone I have, listed about 350 sub tirthas. But there are about -1500 shrines and temples in Banaras alone. These have not been included. Each great tirtha has numerous sub-tirthas as in the Varāba-purāna under Mathurā, in Brahma-purāpa under Gautami, in Vāyu-purāna under Gayā. Through sheer weariness or inadvertence some of these must have been left out by me and some vere left out purposely on account of the absence of any importance Besides, several tirthas that are regarded as sacred by modern people are not so treated in the Epics or purānas' and are not even mentioned in them; many of these have been omitted in this list Our authorities are often very vague about the location or extent of tirthas Moreover, a number of tirthas scattered in different parts of India bear the same name (e. g. vide under Agnitirtha, Kotitirtha, Cakratīrtha, Varahatīrtha, Somatirtha) I am under great obligations to Cunningham's 'Ancient Geography of India' (ed. of 1872) and to Nundo Lal Dog's 'The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval India' (1927). I have had occasions to differ from both, particularly from the latter. But, the space at my disposal baing very limited, I could not enter into even brief discussions 

[Vol.

History of Dharmasastra in support of my views. It would look ungrateful to find fault with the work of Dey; but it must be said that he relies too much on rathor old and antiquated authorities and has not cast his net over a wide area. Often times he mentions no original authoritios (vide, for example, Cakratirtha on p. 43). II. is very vaguo in his references, He hardly ever cites the number of the verso on which he relies and often omits to specify ovon the part or section of the work relied upon. For oramplo, at p. 13 as regards Avanti he mentions Pānini IV. 176, which should bo IV. 1. 176. Turther, he has omitted several well-known tirthas (c. g. Daśāśvamedhika). He is sometimes wrong in what he says. On p. 54 he states that Kiskindhā. kānda 43 refers to Dovadarurana as a proper name, but there the contoxt ('lodbrapadoaka-sandesu dovadāruvanesu oa''in vorso 15) shows that what is meant is 'forests of Deodar trees'). On p. 13 he says Bharatayarsa was' first'called Haimarata varsa, but the passage of the Lingapurana (I. 49.7) on which ho relios (idam haimaratam varsam Bhāratam nāma viśrutam) does not hear that out. There is no reference to a prior account hero and all that is meant is that Bharata varsa is connected trith Himavat, as a previous passage (I. 47, 23 Himadrer daksidom varsam Bharataya nyayedayat) expressly states that Bharatiyarse is to the south of Himalaya, In Salya 44.52 Sarasvati is called Haimapati, but that does not mean that Haimarati was the name of Sarasvati in far-off ages It simply means that it rises in Himayat range.' Only a comparison of the list propared by me with Day's work will show the differ once in details between the two. I should not undertake that task and leave it to scholarly readers, 

I have corefully read the two Epics and most of the Purūnas. But I do not cite exhaustive references to all the texts there a particular tirtha is mentioned. I feel satisfied with mentioning two or three. Owing to the several restric tions imposed upon myself this list cannot claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But I hope that it is comprehensive enough'and far larger and more informative than any list of tirthas presented by any scholar so far, There is ample scope for industrious scholars to improve upon and to add to this list. I have included important tirthas from Kashmir and given copious references to the Nilamata-purāpa, the Rāja-tarangini and the Hara-carita-cintamani. I am highly obliged to the Kashmir Report of Dr. Buhler (published as a special number for 1877 

"

Isist of tirthas

by the B BRAS), to Stein's notes in his translation of the Raja-tarangini and his memoir on the Ancient Geography of Kashmir published separately (and also embodied in the 2nd volume of the translation of Kalhana's work). All the names of tirthas are transliterated into the English alphabet and arranged according to the English mode of spelling. For the Mahābhārata references are given to the oblong Bombay edition and by citing names of parvans, but in the case of the Rāmāyana Roman figures I to VI are employed for the Bala, Ayodhyā, Aranya, Kiskindhā, Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara kāndas respectively. For the Rāmāyana I have used the edition brought out by the Madras Law Journal Press in 1933. Among Purānas the Anandāśrama editions of the Agni, Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Matsya, Vāyu and Padma have been relied upon and as to the rest of the Mahapurānas the Venkate śvara Press editions have been used (except in the case of the Nrasimhapurāpa of which the ṛdition of Messrs. Gopal Narayan & Co. and the Bhāgayatapurāns, of which the Nirnayasāgara edition of the bare text have been referred to). The Skandapurāna has been a source of great trouble and labour, Owing to the limited time at my disposal I have not been able to digest thoroughly the ninety thousand; and odd verses of that purāna, though I have very carefully gone into the Kāśikhanda and some other khandas. Besides, there are two separate recensions of the Skanda and large portions of it appear to be apocrypbal and later additions. The seven big sections of the Skanda viz Mabesvarakhanda, Vaisnava, Brāhma, Kāśi, Ārantya, Nāgara, Prabhāsa are indicated by Roman figures from I to VI and the sub-sections by Arabic figures. Some of these sub-sections have further sub-divisions into Pūrvārdha and Uttarārdba, , , 

I have made endeavours to locate the tirthas as far as possible. Inscriptions have been drawn upon in several cases for locating the tirthas and for their antiquities and history. The principal Sanskrit authorities (except Kalbana) are often very Fague as compared with even foreign writers like Hiouen Thsang, Alberuni and Abul Fazal. Where I was not myself sure I have given references to the texts alone, and in some cases to the views of Cunningham, Dey, Pargiter and others If the same name happens to be given to different tirtbas located at different places, I have 'indicated the several different places bearing the same name by employing the capital letters 

726 

History of Dharmātāstra 

I Vol. A, B, C and so on. I may state that I have hardly ever remained content by borrowing references to Sanskrit authorities given by my predecessors, but have seen personally each reference to Sanskrit works except where I expressly state from whom I borrow a particular reference Sorensen's Index of the Mahābhārata and the Vedic Index of Macdonell and Keith have been used in several places I have also derived material help from the volumes of the Imperial Gazetteer and from the several volunies of the Bombay Gazetteer. The same may be said about Wilson's translation of Visnupurāna (ed. by Hall, 1864-1877), Pargiter's notes to his translation of the Mārkan doyapurāva, Dr. B. C. Law's paper on the mountains and rivers of India' in the Journal of the Department of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. 28 and Dr. Hemchandra Raychaud buri's “Studies in Indian Antiquities' (1932), and the paper on 'Ancient towns and cities in Gujarat and Kathiawad' in I.A. TO). 54. I have consulted only a few Mābātuyas of tirthas, Recently, Prof. V. R. Ramchandra Dikshitar of Madras has published a useful work "The Purāna Index' (volumes I and II covering over 1400 pages) which collects material from five Purānas only viz. the Bhagavata, Brahmānda, Matsya, Vāyu and Vispu . The two volumes reach up to the Sanskrit letter 'ma' only. 1, 'for my part, do not agree with much that he says about the age of the Porānas in general and of the five Puranas (which he has digested) in particular, but this is not the place to go into that question Besides, his work has to be used with some caution, In several places the work is misleading. To take only a few examples. On p. 547 he lists 'Godhūma', makes the remark 

fit for sraddha' and cites four references from the Visnuputada alone. One may prima face think that Godhūma is here some place fit for srāddha. As a matter of fact in all the references from the Vispupurāna "Godhūma' means 'wheat' and nothing more, which no doubt is fit food for śrāddha But other fit things such as 'iksu' (declared to be fit for sraddha by' Vāya 78. 7-8) are not inoluded at all. On p 123 Aśokavana is not a proper name, but only a forest of Asoka trees, as the preceding 

So also Karaala word 'drāksavana' (in Vāyu 38 68) indicates prabhava (not "prabhava' as printed on'p. 316 of vol. I) is not a river (in Matsya 163. 62, Ānandāśrama ed) but is only an adjective of the word Sopa that follows. On p. 316 of vol. II be states that the river Parā rises from Rsyayan, but the Matsya 114.24 on which he relies says it springs from Pariyabra, Oa 

the same page he gives the entry "Pārāvāratata sacred to

Mata'. This makes no sense. Pārāvāratata would mean 'the shore of the sea'. What is really meant is that Devi is styled or worshipped as Pārā on the bank of the Pārā river (Pārā Pārātate matā). He does not compare the readings of the several printed editions of the five purānas. Besides, the 

information furnished is very meagre. If the whole'had been * printed in a compact form far more information could have 

been given in the same number of pages. 

In some places I have indicated the rewards promised for bathing in the tirthas; but I have not done so in every case. The purānas promise one or Inore of the following rewards viz the same merit as the performance of Ašvamedha or Vājapeya or other solemn Vedic sacrifices or teaching the highest worlds such as those of Brahma, Visnu or Siva, the destruction of the gravest sins such as brāhmana murder, the same merit as arises frono gifts of a thousand cows &c. 

Many of the doubts and difficulties about the identification of several tirthas can, if at all, be solved only by means of actual journeys to various places and investigations on the spot. That is a task which would require for its proper accom 

plishment a team of workers. A single individual can hardly ' attempt such a task with his own resources. 

This list will, it is hoped, be of some use in elucidating. several problems such as the questions about the relative anti quity of the purānas, the dates of several Sanskrit works which mention'the tirthas and the questions about borrowing on the part of puradas among themselves and from the Mahābhārata.

three miles from Kodidar is sor Tounded by the ruins of a temple which popular Hindu belief declares to be tbe origraal Dvārabā, where Krmaresided and whence transferred bimself to Dvaraka ia Olhamandala. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. VIII. (on Katbiawas) pp. 518-520 for Kodipar and p 552 for Müla Dvāraka. It was founded by Krsna (with Rai. vataka as a park aod Gomanta as a bill) owing to constant invasions and harassmeat by Jarāsandba; it tras two yojanas long and one yojapa broad. Vide Sabhāparva 14. 49-55. The Vat. (149, 7-8) makes at 10 yoja pas long and 5 broad Vide p 688 above ander Matburā. B (14.54-56) says that the Vrsgis and Andbakas left Mathura through fear of Kalay avana, took counsel with Krşna, ran to Kasasthali and built up Dvaraka: Vi v. 23. 13-15, B 196 13-15 say that Krsga begged 'of the ocean a strip of tsvelve yojanas, built Dvāraka with large parks, maasions aod strong walls and established the people of Mathura tbere. When Krsna passed away, the city was flooded by the sea and swept away, as stated in a prophetic veio by Mausala-parva 6.23-24 and 7. 41-42. B 210, 55 and 212.9. Vide also Vi. V.33 9 (the whole of Dvarakā except Krsna's palace was swept by the sca) and BV IV, 129,44 (except Rokoz ai's palace). It is called the capital of Aparta (Udyoga 7. 6) and was first called Kušasthali (Sabhā 14. 50) Vide M 69,9=P. V. 23, 20, B, 7,29 32 and Ag 273, 12 (Kusastbalī being the earlier name of the capital). The present Dvārakż is near Olha 10 Kathiawar. The Harivansa II (Visu parva) chapters 58 and 98 deal with the founding of Dvāralā Some an. cient Jaia works like the Uttarādby. ayanasutra (SBE, vol. 45 p.115) men lion Dvārakā and Rairataka park 

(Girnat). -The Jātakas also refer to Dyāraka. Vide Dr. B C. Law's work on 'Iadia as described in early texts of Buddhism and Jainism' pp. 102,239. The Prabbasakbanda of the SK has A sab-section on Dvāraka in 44 chap. ters and over 2000 verses for the glorification of Dvārakā. It says the reward that is secured by (prigri mage to) Vārānasi, Kurolsetra and Narmadā can be secured at Dvārakā ja balf a triokle (4. 52)"; "Pilgri mage to Dvarala is the 4th means of mukti. Man secures mukti by acquiring correct knowledge about Brahman or by dying at Prayaga or by mere bath in Gomati near Krsna" (SK. VII, 4. 4. 97-98). The BV. (Krsnajanmalbanda, Uttarardha chap. 103) has a hyperbolical descrip tion of the creation of Dvārala, wbich is said to have been one hundred yojanas in extent. There is a work called Dvārakā-pattalaka compiled by Binabžyi (the only Ms, of which is the one at BOR I. in Poopa) wbich bas been published by Dr. J B. Chaudhurı (1940). The Ms is dated sandet 1574 (1518 A. D). It sommarises the Dvāraha mahatmya in SK. A pilgrim on reach iog Dvāralā first worships Gagesa, then Balarama and then Krsoa; ho visits Rukzgini's tercple on the 8th, 9th or 14th trthi, then visits Cabra tirtba, then Dvārabz Ganga, then Saglboddbāra, tben tathes in the Gomati. The temple of Dvāraka nātha is on the north bank of the Gomati creek. The main temple has five stories, is about 100 feet high from the ground and is sur mounted by a conical spire risiog to about 150 feet. Vide Dr. A. D.

CONCLUDING REMARKS ON TĪRTHAS 

At the end of this long list of tirthas a few words, as promised on p. 722 above, must be said about the attitude that we Indians of the 20th century should adopt towards the moun tains, rivers and other holy places in Bhārata. Modera secular education and the prevailing economic conditions, stresses and trends leave hardly any room for moral and spiritual uplift, We are surrounded on all sides by anxiety, want, misery, hardness of heart and crime. Therefore, the endeavour of all those who have the good of our country at heart must be to cherish all such institutions as tend to lift the mind out of Darrowness and to make it concentrate for some time at least on noble thoughts and aspirations and on detachment from tho all-engrossing pursuit of money, Pilgrimage is one of such institutions. Those who have faith in pilgrimages as enabling a pilgrim to attain heaven, to collect merit and reach release from samsāra should give pilgrimages a new orientation, should see that their charity is not wasted on indolent, ignor ant and vicious priests, should improve the methods of worship at holy places in such a way as will satisfy all hygienic requirements. The priestly class at holy places should romein ber that in the coming generations they are likely to find their occupation gone, unless they improve themselves, unless they try to be less ignorant and indolent than they aro at present and really serve as honest business agents or Travol lers' Guides The number of people visiting holy places in the belief of accumulating merit is sure to becomo less and loss, as modern secular education spreads. But it would be a calamity for the moral and spiritual greatness of India if pilgrimages to holy mountains and rivers came to be stopped altogether. I would very strongly recommend to all men, however highly educated, the undertaking of pilgrimages to certain hallowed spots. Our country has recently secured independence and it now rests entirely with us to make or mar the charnctor of the teeming millions of this our land. All things that tend to create in Indians the deep feeling that amidst diversitics of physical features, food, dress and habits, all of them are ono people, that there is no part or district of this past land which cannot claim to have made some substantial contribution in religious and philosophical thought, in abiding literature, in works of art and in holy places that the destinies of the Indians

Concluding remarks on tirthas

of one part of Bhārata are bound up with the destinies of all others. Frequent visits to distant places in Bhārata, mixing up among people of other parts and understanding their peculiar good points, needs and failings is absolutely necessary if we are to keep our freedom. India is thrice bjest in the mountain ranges of the Himalaya,which contains the highest peaks in the world and is full of large and life-giving rivers and of numerous shrines associated with the names of the greatest sages and heroes of antiquity. Every Indian who is proud of the great religious and spiritual heritage of our country must make it a point to devote some part of his time to frequenting holy mountains, rivers and other places of pilgrimage, When we see even from a distance the purity, the whiteness and the serenity of the snow-capped peaks of the Himalaya, the play of delicate and exquisite hues and tints of blue, mauve, and pink when the sun begins to shine on them, a sense of wonder, joy and elevation comes upon us, The glorious view of a peak like Kinchinjunga, which is an unforgettable experience, lifts up the whole life of the onlooker to a higher plane for long. Similarly, the sight of the holy Ganges at night or at sunrise in Haridvāra or on the majestic Ghats in Banaras surely empties our minds of meanness and for the moment at least fills our hearts with a sense of nature's beauty and with purity, and brings us in tune with the Infi nite, I may state here that the talk of the conquest of Everest in which some members of European expeditions indulge jars on my ears. This great peak has so far vanquished (physically) all those who attempted the conquest & But in a figurative sense Everest and other high peaks have been for ages conquer ing the hoarts of men. Even the members of these expeditions will admit that Everest and its brethren have drawn men to themselves from all parts of the world, made them give up their usual uneventful and placid activities, have evoked in tliose who attempt the climbing of these giants unbelievable courago, ondurance, resourcefulness and self-abnegation and have been instrumental in exhibiting to the world what un known powers the human spirit possesses. Therefore, these silent but awe-inspiring peaks should be looked upon as teachers of mankind and not as material things to be conquered and dealt with by human beings as they please

Page 118 Note 267. On pp. 117-118 above reference has boon niade to the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those that had been converted to Christianity or Islam by force or fraud or even voluntarily. Not only was there re-admission of those that were converted, but non-Hindus, such as Yavanas, Kiratas, Śakas, were absorbed into the Hindu fold and vere induced to adopt the practices of Hindus (such as śrāddhas and gifts to brahmanas) Vide Santiparva chap. 65. 13-21 quoted above in note 830 (p. 364). A Greek ambassador of king Antalikita (Antialkidas) named Heliodora, son of Diya (Dion), was aocre dited to the court of king Bhāgabhadra, called himself Bhāga vata and raised a column in honour of Vāsudova in the end century B. C. (JRAS 1909, pp. 1053 and 1087 and JBBRAS vol. 23 p 104). Usavadāta, son of Dipika and son-in-law of Ksatrapa Nahapāna, is described in one of the Nasik inscrip tions (No. 14a in E. I Vol. VIII at p. 85) as a saka, but made very extensive donations to brāhmanas at Broach, Prabhāsa and other places. Part of one of his inscriptions is cited on p. 110 note 1618 above. Though the name Usavadāta (Rsabha datta) is a Sanskritized one the two names Dinīka and Naba pāna of the Ksaharāta race appear to be non-Indian, Abhiras, Hüpas and Gurjaras became absorbed into the Hindu commu nity. People, after being made Moslems, returned to their ori ginal communities and gods. Moslem writers make this clear, Vide Elliot and Dowsons''History of India' vol. I. p. 126 (“the people of India had returned to idolatry, excepting those of Kasa') and Alberuni's India (tr. by Sachau) vol. II. pp. 162-163 where he refers to the return of Hindu slaves in Moslem coun tries to their country and religion. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar in Some aspects of Anciont Indian Culture' (1940) pp. 59-65 presents a very lucid and informing summary of the evidence on this point of the re-admission of those that were converted and of the absorption of non-Hindus. But it 18 not known what procedure was followed for this purpose. Therefore, a model rite for the return of a convert is set out here,

No. 216 of 1879-80 copied in samvat 1539 (1482A D.), No. 196 of 1884-1887 copied in samvat 1578 (1521 A D.) and No 85 of 1895–1902 copied in savivat 1780. All these mass, contain the blijsya af Hanhara, which ascribes the work to Fastraat in the first as the commentary on the first three verses is wanting. I intended at first to give explanations in Sanskrit of these verses (as p 308 will indicate) but owing to considerations of space I omitted the Sanskrit explanations.
