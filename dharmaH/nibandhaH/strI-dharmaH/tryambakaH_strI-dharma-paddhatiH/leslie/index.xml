      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Madhya Pradesh, a high-caste brahmin woman named Bhuribai prostrates herself before a new sati shrine. It is 1974. For her, and for countless other traditional Hindu women in India today, the perfect woman is the pativrata, the devoted wife whose entire existence is dedicated to her husband. Ideally, such a woman dies before her husband; if by some mischance she does not, the wrong may be put right by taking her own life on her husband&amp;rsquo;s pyre. She is then worshipped as a goddess, the perfect example of the self-sacrificing wife. Bhuribai&amp;rsquo;s fervent prayer before that shrine is that she may never suffer the misfortune and disgrace of becoming a widow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One might reasonably expect that a text, or indeed a book, on the religious role of women would give considerable space to a discussion of the various aspects of the ascetic or monastic life: what sects were considered acceptable for women; the reason for opting for a life of renunciation; when and how a woman might do this; ceremonies of initiation; the signs and symbols of a woman&amp;rsquo;s new status; the expectations, duties and privileges that go with it; and so on. This is perhaps the most glaring omission in Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s treatise, and therefore also in this book. For Tryambaka does not allow women the option of renunciation at all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
