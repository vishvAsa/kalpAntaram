Tryambaka opens his treatise with a typical invocation: ‘Hail to Gaṇādhipati! Hail to Sarasvati! Hail to (the line) of teachers!’1 Gaṇādhipati, more commonly called Ganapati or Gaṇeśa (‘Lord of troops’), is traditionally worshipped as the remover of obstacles. As ‘one who causes an auspicious beginning’ (mangalārambhaḥ), he is invoked at the start of rituals or other projects. This is however a late development: Gaṇeśa is not invoked in the gṛhyaor dharmasutras. Sarasvati is the goddess of eloquence and learning.">

  <p>I. Tryambaka&rsquo;s Introduction</p>
<p>(Sdhp. 1v. 1-2v. 5)</p>
<p>Tryambaka opens his treatise with a typical invocation: &lsquo;Hail to Gaṇādhipati! Hail to Sarasvati! Hail to (the line) of teachers!&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Gaṇādhipati, more commonly called Ganapati or Gaṇeśa (&lsquo;Lord of troops&rsquo;), is traditionally worshipped as the remover of obstacles. As &lsquo;one who causes an auspicious beginning&rsquo; (mangalārambhaḥ), he is invoked at the start of rituals or other projects. This is however a late development: Gaṇeśa is not invoked in the gṛhyaor dharmasutras. Sarasvati is the goddess of eloquence and learning.</p>
<p>The text continues with four introductory verses.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref1:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> &lsquo;Obedient service to one&rsquo;s husband (bhartṛśuśruṣaṇam) is the primary religious duty enjoined by sacred tradition for women. When the daughter of the Himalayas (Pārvatī) realized that this duty was endorsed by her father, she put it into practice and so assumed the form (abhajata) of half the body of her husband. May she always show me how to follow the path of sacred law!&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Śuśrūsanam and śuśrūṣā (lit. ‘desire to hear&rsquo;) cover a range of meanings and associations from the reverential (such as the Vedic student&rsquo;s ministrations to his teacher and the devotee&rsquo;s homage to his god) to the subservient (such as the obsequious services of the slave). With regard to women, it manages to combine all three and describes the proper attitude of the wife to her lord: obedience in matters of principle; diligent and attentive service in the practical matters of every day. It also bridges without difficulty the apparent gap between religious duties and daily chores: the wife&rsquo;s service to her husband in the home is her worship of her god. Tryambaka returns to this topic in his concluding section where he defines patiśuśruṣaṇam in three different ways (see section V, p. 305). In particular, he argues that the term &lsquo;service&rsquo; (suśrūṣā) covers every</p>
<p>[[30]]</p>
<p>thing that gives a husband pleasure; that there are clear parallels both with the son&rsquo;s relationship with his mother, and with the &lsquo;service&rsquo; offered by the student to his teacher; and thus that ‘obedience&rsquo; (ājñakaraṇa) is included in the more general term &lsquo;service&rsquo; (suśrūṣā; see section V, pp. 312-13). Abhajata is probably intended here as a pun, for √√bhaj may have a variety of meanings: &rsquo;to obtain as one&rsquo;s share&rsquo;; &rsquo;to serve, honour or devote oneself to&rsquo;; and &rsquo;to take on the shape or form of.</p>
<p>The reference to Pārvatī, one of the most popular examples of the devoted wife, recalls the story told to explain the haritālikāvrata. This &lsquo;vow&rsquo; or religious observance, performed by women alone and especially popular in Maharashtra even today, involves the worship of coloured clay images of Parvati, her (female) friend, and the symbol of the god Śiva (the sivalinga). It is described only in the later medieval digests such as the Vratarāja of Viśvanatha, the Nirnayasindhu of Kamalākarabhatta, and the Vratārka of Sankarabhatta Ghare (PVK V.i.p.144-5). The story, said to have been narrated to Parvati by Śiva himself, recounts how by her own devotions Pārvatī both acquired Siva as her husband (cf. Nagaswamy 1983:46-51) and attained the honour of becoming half of his body. This half-male, half-female form of Śiva (ardhanārīśvara) is graphically depicted in temple sculptures such as those in the Elephanta caves off Bombay (cf. Zimmer 1983:vol.II, plates 256,258;139). Similarly, in the umāmaheśvarasamvāda section of the Mahābhārata, Śiva reminds his wife that she is half of him, sprung from half his body.3</p>
<p>The image also reinforces the ideal oneness of the married human couple: husband and wife as complementary halves of one whole. This is a popular image. In the famous passage from the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad (1.4.1-2), the primeval Self in the shape of a man (puruṣavidhah) longs for a second: he falls (√pat) into two parts from which arise husband (pati) and wife (patni). Hence their subsequent union is the reuniting of two halves. Similarly, in Sat.Br.V.2.1.10, the sacrificer includes his wife in the vājapeya ritual on the grounds that she is half of himself and he wishes to go to the &lsquo;supreme goal&rsquo; complete. This much-extolled oneness does not, however, bear close examination. The Upanisadic Self, like Śiva, continues to identify</p>
<p>[[31]]</p>
<p>with his male half, pursuing the female in her various forms for the purpose of sexual intercourse. On the human level, the oneness of the married couple means not the merging of two individuals but the self-effacement of one of them. In the Mahabharata, for example, Gāndhārī adopts not only her husband&rsquo;s lifestyle and interests, but his physical characteristics as well: she binds her eyes so as not to excel the blind Dhṛtarastra in any way (Mbh.I.110.14). As Tryambaka&rsquo;s treatise on women unfolds, it becomes increasingly clear that the ideal wife is one whose duties, purpose and identity derive entirely from her husband. In practical terms, as we shall see, this is what is meant by the oneness of marriage. For the goddess Parvati or the ideal woman such as Sakuntala, the whole woman—as wife becomes absorbed into half the man (ardham bhāryā manuṣyasya; Mbh.I.68.40a).</p>
<p>Sati is the daughter of Dakṣa; that is, Pārvatī in a previous birth. When Daksa insulted Siva by refusing to invite him to his great sacrifice, Sati immolated herself in the fire (Bhag.P.IV.2. 1-IV.4.34; Śiv. P., satīkhanda). Later, when the world was threatened by the demon Taraka, it was prophesied that only the child of Śiva and Parvati could destroy him. So, in order to show favour to the world&rsquo;, Parvati set out to win Śiva: first by her beauty, and, when that failed, by her religious devotion. Eventually, Skanda was born and both gods and universe were saved (Śiv.P., pārvatīkhanda; Sk. P., kāsīkhanda; Rām.I; Kumarasambhava).</p>
<p>The importance of the son at this mythological level reinforces the orthodox view that the wife&rsquo;s main purpose is to be the bearer of a son for her husband&rsquo;s family. As Sakuntala declares, a wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;wifehood&rsquo; lies in the fact that a husband enters her and is reborn</p>
<p>[[32]]</p>
<p>from her. Satī reincarnates as Pārvatī to give birth to Skanda. Whether for goddess or mortal, Manu&rsquo;s dictum holds: women were created to give birth (Manu IX.96). In so doing, they fit into the ordained scheme of things and thus &lsquo;show favour to the world&rsquo;. In the Satapathabrahmana example quoted earlier, the sacrificer finds in this the logic behind the ‘oneness&rsquo; of the married couple: without a wife, a man cannot be reborn (naiva. . . prajāyate; meaning both &rsquo;to beget&rsquo; and &rsquo;to become an embryo&rsquo;) and so remains incomplete (asarva); by taking a wife, he is reborn and so becomes complete (Śat.Br.V.2.1.10).</p>
<p>After mātṛ, jananī is perhaps the commonest word for &lsquo;mother&rsquo;. The invocations and references to Parvati may also suggest that Tryambaka is here (and in the final colophon; section V, p. 317, note 8) identifying his own mother with the mother of the universe. A third possibility is that the queen-mother (rājajananī) is meant. This meaning of jananī is attested by H.H. Wilson, presumably drawn from the examples provided to him by the pandits of Calcutta (MW 1976:411; xi). Certainly, Dīpāmba, the mother of both Śāhaji and Serfoji (both of whom Tryambaka served as minister), was a powerful figure whose patronage of scholars is often cited. In particular, she is known to have commissioned Raghunatha Pandita to write two Marathi works on strīdharma at about this time: Narakavarṇana and Pativratādharma (see my introduction, pp. 20–2).</p>
<p>[[33]]</p>
<p>best and which are for the most part well known throughout sacred tradition. If virtuous women put them into practice, they will attain a good reputation, unequalled religious merit, immediate happiness in this world and heaven after death.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>Tryambaka begins his introduction proper by explaining why the rules for purification (saucācāra) are examined first. &lsquo;For it is said that “if a man does not perform the rituals of purification, his actions will bear no fruit.”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> In order to achieve results in other spheres, therefore, one must perform these rituals. This is why the rules for purification are investigated first.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
<p>It is not entirely clear which sense of sauca is intended here. In its wider sense, as defined by Hārīta, sauca is both external (bāhya) and internal (āntara or ābhyantara). External purification includes that of family (kula; due to a birth or death in the family), of objects (artha; such as the vessels and implements in use every day), and of the body (śarīra; in particular the cleansing of the body after urinating, etc.; see section IIA, pp. 71-4. Internal purification includes that of the mind (mānasa), of the eye (cākṣuṣa; i.e. not looking at what should not be looked at), of the nose (ghranya), of speech (vācya), and of the tongue (svādya). In this allembracing sense, therefore, sauca is the first path to dharma, the basis of brahman, the abode of prosperity, a soothing balm to the mind and so on.10</p>
<p>But this can hardly be what Tryambaka means. For the quotation he gives here reappears in his section on sauca in its narrower sense of the cleansing of the body after urinating and so on. Certainly, failure to follow the requirements laid down was deemed to</p>
<p>[[34]]</p>
<p>have dire consequences. In Mbh.III.56.3, for example, evil and difficulty (in the form of kali) take possession of Nala precisely because he has failed to wash his feet after urinating. But if, as seems likely, this narrow meaning is intended, then Tryambaka is speaking somewhat loosely here: he does not in fact examine sauca before he has dealt with several other topics first. The principle, however, is clear.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s second point is that the rulings he is about to expound apply only to married women. He argues by analogy with the case for men. Three separate and unattributed quotations are produced to support his statement that &lsquo;religious law prescribes no rules for men until they have been invested with the sacred thread (lit. “until the binding on of the muñja grass”).’<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>First, &rsquo;they (the lawbooks or lawgivers) place no restrictions on one&rsquo;s actions until the investiture of the sacred thread (has taken place).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> In Baudh.I.2.3.6, the quotation is completed with the explanation that, until one is born again through the Veda (i.e. Vedic education), one is on the same level as the sudra. Vas.II.6 quotes Hārīta to the same effect. Secondly, &lsquo;before initiation, they (i.e. children; in this context, boys) may do, say and eat what they please.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> This quotation from Gautama implies that uninitiated children are not expected to obey the rules of social behaviour or grammar, or the prohibitions on food and drink applicable to their elders (cf. Bal. on Yajñ.I.15). According to the Balambhaṭṭī, even if such a child touches a candāla or outcast, he need not take the ritual bath with his clothes on that is normally prescribed. However, Haradatta adds that such licence in fact applies only to very young children, those under five years of age, and not to the uninitiated in general who might (according to some authorities, including Gautama himself, e.g. II.1.6-15) remain so until the age of twenty-two. For the Balambhaṭṭī, the crucial age is six.</p>
<p>sāstrena).</p>

<p>[[35]]</p>
<p>Thirdly, &lsquo;once the teacher has performed the initiation ceremony, he should first instruct his pupil in the rituals of purification, good conduct, the worship of the sacrificial fire, and the twilight rituals.&rsquo; 14</p>
<p>&lsquo;In the case of women, however,&rsquo; Tryambaka continues, &lsquo;marriage has taken the place of initiation.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> Or, as the quotation from Manu puts it, &lsquo;for women, the marriage ritual is held to be the equivalent of initiation, serving one&rsquo;s husband that of residing in the teacher&rsquo;s. house, and household duties that of the worship of the sacrificial fire.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> It thus follows that, &lsquo;before marriage, women too are free to do, say and eat what they please; for the rules apply only after marriage.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> We may safely assume here that Haradatta&rsquo;s restriction of the rule to the very young would apply to women too. For, although Gautama advises men to marry their daughters off before puberty, he also rules that an unmarried girl who has had three menstrual periods may find her own husband. Thus, in Gautama&rsquo;s time at least, a girl might still be unmarried in her early teens (Gaut. II.9.20-1). The Balambhaṭṭī merely adds that the licence given to the uninitiated boy is applied also to a girl, as long as she remains unmarried (with the implication that she would be married by the age of six). Since Tryambaka is concerned only with married women, he does not himself examine the question of exactly when a girl should marry. However, judging by the sternness of his remarks concerning the sanctity of a woman&rsquo;s ṛtu or &lsquo;season&rsquo; (see section IV, pp. 287-8), we may assume that he favours pre-pubertal marriage for girls. Here, he concludes simply that &rsquo;the sacred duties he is about to expound are therefore to be performed by women only after they are married.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>メ</p>
<p>[[36]]</p>
<p>There is a curious contradiction here. Before initiation, a child is considered-for ritual if not social purposes-to be equivalent to a sūdra (see Baudh.I.2.3.6; Vas.II.6): Since, as Manu and Tryambaka explain, the marriage ceremony is to be taken as the girl&rsquo;s initiation, she too is ritually equivalent to a sūdra before her marriage. The implication is obvious: a boy after his initiation and a girl after marriage are no longer held to be at the level of the sudra. Tryambaka then explains that all the sacred duties he is about to describe apply to married women. But the next two quotations he cites (one on sauca, the other on acamana) explicitly equate the (married) woman and the sudra. This means that women are ritual sūdras both before and after marriage; the only difference is that they may follow their own whims before they marry, their husbands&rsquo; afterwards.</p>
<p>But this is in origin a historical rather than a philosophical problem (see Leslie 1980:15 ff.; 1983(1):99–100). In the Vedic era, the period of study and brahmacarya discipline was deemed essential for girls as well as boys. 19 The reason is important: the upanayana of women was vital to the continuation of the varna system. Without it, all women would be reduced to the level of the śūdra and, as Hārīta explains, sūdras cannot give birth to brahmins, kṣatriyas or vaisyas.20 Although the actual practice of female students probably came to differ from that of males, the fact of initiation remained. Yama, for example, while agreeing that upanayana, Vedic education and the recitation of mantras should be open to girls, advocates that they should be taught only by their fathers, uncles and brothers; that they should not beg from door to door but only from their own homes; that they should not wear deerskins or grow matted hair.21</p>
<p>As language and culture developed away from those of Vedic texts, more extensive commentaries became necessary, and increasingly long periods of study were required to understand the</p>
<p>[[37]]</p>
<p>accumulating literature. But whereas it was acceptable for boys to postpone marriage until their twenties or thirties, it was still thought essential for girls to marry in their teens. The effect was to divide women into two kinds: the &lsquo;brahmavādinī (lit. ‘one who discusses brahman&rsquo;), who was initiated in the lighting of the sacred fire, the reading of Vedic texts, and begging in her own home; and the sadyovadhu (lit. &lsquo;one who becomes a bride on the same day, i.e. as her initiation&rsquo;) for whom the ceremony was a mere formality just before her marriage.22 By the time of Hārīta (approximately 500 B.C.), the majority of girls fell into the latter category. The lack of Vedic training for girls made nonsense of their use of mantras, so it is no surprise that by the time of Manu (i.e. at the turn of the era), the initiation of girls was performed without them (cf. Manu II.66, IX.18). By the time of Yajnavalkya (i.e. the first or second century of the Christian era), the upanayana of girls was prohibited altogether (cf. Yājñ.I.13). At some point during this transition-in order to justify the marriage of uninitiated girls to twice-born men and thus to rescue the entire varna systemthere arose the compensatory theory that the marriage ritual took the place of initiation for girls. This in turn lent weight to the idea that girls should be married at a very early age. For it was felt that the girl&rsquo;s &lsquo;initiation&rsquo; (i.e. marriage) should take place at the same age as that appropriate for the boy&rsquo;s upanayana.</p>
<p>It is often argued that this trend was based on the belief that the increasingly long period of study was vital because even the smallest mistake in ritual or recitation could have disastrous results (e.g. Pāninisikṣā 52, cited Altekar 1978:201–2). Although there is undoubtedly some truth in this, the argument is not wholly convincing. First, women are not the only ones liable to make mistakes. Now as always, men make mistakes all the time. In fact, after each undertaking, a final ritual is performed that is specifically designed to remove the sin of any mistakes made in the process. There are also special prāyaścitta rituals to cope with the problem. Secondly, according to mīmāmsā philosophy, an injunction or prohibition is weakened if it is thought necessary to shore it up with experiental</p>
<p>[[38]]</p>
<p>reasons. Adrsta rulings are always more cogent than drṣta ones (see my discussion of these terms in section IIA, p. 58 below). Thus to say that Vedic initiation and education are barred to women because they are more liable to make mistakes is to weaken the validity of the prohibition; no reason need or indeed should be given.</p>
<p>In time, the argument turned full circle. Instead of the absence of upanayana having as its consequence the status of sudra, the a priori sūdra status of women came to be seen as the reason for their ineligibility in the first place. Now commentators had to work hard to explain away the all too obvious references to the upanayana of girls in earlier texts. On Gobh.gr.II.1.19, for example, the commentator explains that the term yajñopavītini cannot mean literally &lsquo;she who wears the sacred thread&rsquo; since women may not do so; it must therefore refer to a bride who wears her sari draped over her left shoulder &rsquo;like&rsquo; a sacred thread. On the same grounds, Sankara interprets the reference to a &rsquo;learned (pandita) daughter&rsquo; in Br.Up.VI.4.17 as a reference to domestic learning and expertise (gṛhatantraviṣayam). When Manu declares that no sacred rite may be performed with mantras for women, his first reason is that they are &lsquo;weak&rsquo; and &lsquo;impure&rsquo;; his second that they are ignorant of . Vedic literature (Manu IX.18; Baudh.I.11.7; Mbh.XIII.40.11–12). Śūdra status is now associated directly with the female state and only indirectly with the lack of upanayana and Vedic education.</p>
<p>Tryambaka evidently has a problem. In order to persuade women of the religious significance of their role, he expounds the view that the marriage ritual is their initiation onto the religious path. But as his treatise continues, we meet again and again the conviction that even married (i.e. ‘initiated&rsquo;) women are ritually equivalent to the uninitiated sudra. Tryambaka uses the first view to inspire women to take their domestic existence seriously, to elevate it to the level of religious ritual, and to discourage them from wasting their devotional energy on other (i.e. non-domestic) forms of worship. He uses the second view to remind women that being female is an awesome hurdle they must strive to overcome. The rulings on daily duties (strīṇām āhnikam; see section II, pp. 44-245) follow from the first; the digression on the inherent nature of women (strīsvabhavaḥ; see section III) from the second.</p>
<p>The problem of how ritual sūdras can give birth to brahmins, kṣatriyas and vaiśyas — voiced above by Hārīta―remains. The</p>
<p>[[39]]</p>
<p>solution is presumably to be found in the discussions concerning the various ways in which varna may fluctuate. A child&rsquo;s varna is defined by the ‘seeď&rsquo; (bīja) from which it sprang; and not from the &lsquo;field&rsquo; (kṣetra) in which that seed was planted (Manu X.70-2; cf. section V.9.c). Thus a sudra womb that receives brahmin &lsquo;seed&rsquo; produces a brahmin child. A man&rsquo;s varṇa may be changed by his own conduct. Thus Viśvāmitra, who was born a kṣatriya, becomes a brahmin through tapas (austerities; cf. Manu X.42, Kull.). A woman&rsquo;s varṇa, on the other hand, is defined by that of her husband: whatever her father&rsquo;s birth or her own behaviour, she assumes in the &lsquo;oneness&rsquo; of marriage both the qualities and the status of her husband, merging with him as a river merges with the sea (cf. Manu IX.22-4; X.67).</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s third introductory point is that &rsquo;the general rules (sāmānyadharmāḥ) prescribed for men are equally applicable to women.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> By this, Tryambaka does not mean sanātanadharmāḥ, the code of universal values such as non-injury, purity, truth and good will (cf.Kaut.1.3.13; Vām.P.14.1; Āp.I.8.23.6; etc.). The reference here is to non-specific rules of conduct.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s argument runs as follows. &lsquo;Injunctions relating specifically to women presuppose the widespread acceptance of general rulings (of which these specific ones are the modifications).&rsquo; 24 He gives two examples. First, &rsquo;the wise declare that the purification ritual required of a woman and a sudra is half (that prescribed for a twice-born man).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup> This statement clearly presupposes some general ruling (such as Manu V. 136) to the effect that (i.e. after urinating and defecating) one should purify the sexual organ, the anus, the left hand, and then both hands, by applying earth and water one, three, ten and seven times respectively. Manu V.137 gives the modifying rule for Vedic students, forest hermits and ascetics. Tryambaka&rsquo;s example gives that for women and sudras. Secondly, &lsquo;both a woman and a sudra are purified by touching</p>
<p>[[40]]</p>
<p>(water) once on (or in) the mouth.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> This ruling on acamana, the ritual of sipping water, again presupposes some general statement (such as Manu V.139a) to the effect that he who desires to be pure should sip water three times. Yājñ.I.21a gives the modifying rule for twice-born men; Yajñ.1.21b (Tryambaka&rsquo;s example) gives that for women and sūdras.</p>
<p>Tryambaka concludes from this that &lsquo;rulings such as &ldquo;he who, rising early, sees. .&rdquo;,<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> which prescribe duties for men (in the technical sense that they are couched in the masculine form without any additional modifying rules) are in fact equally applicable to women.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> This is an important point for Tryambaka&rsquo;s treatise, especially in his long section on daily rites or duties (strīṇām āhnikam, section II, pp. 44-245). For, in the absence of rulings specific to women on subjects such as what should or should not be seen in the early morning (darśaniyāny adarśaniyāni ca; section IIA, (pp. 54-7), urinating and defecating (mutrapurīṣotsargah; pp. 69 – 71), or cleaning one&rsquo;s teeth (dantadhāvanam, pp. 78-82). Tryambaka is obliged to quote passages couched in the masculine and assume that they apply to women too.</p>
<p>But what appears, in this context, to be no more than a straightforward grammatical point is in fact an extremely significant issue in the history of the religious status of women in India. First, let us look at the question from the grammarian&rsquo;s point of view. Patanjali&rsquo;s Mahābhāṣya (one of the most important works on Sanskrit grammar, dating from c.140 B.C.) declares that there are five reasons to study the science of grammar: for the preservation of the Veda; for the understanding of the rules of modification or uha; for the</p>
<p>[[41]]</p>
<p>sake of scripture or tradition; to make one&rsquo;s studies easier; and to remove doubt (rakṣohāgamalaghvasamdehāḥ; Pat.1.8). On the subject of ūha, Pat.I.9 explains that mantras are not stated in the Veda in all genders, cases and so on. For the preservation of the true meaning of the Veda, therefore, the study of the rules of ūha is essential if one is to make the required modifications to the sacrifice. By the seventeenth century, however, Nageśa&rsquo;s commentary interprets linga to mean not &lsquo;gender&rsquo; as it clearly does in the original passage but &rsquo;the stem (of a noun)&rsquo; which is only a very late sense of the term. This is evidence of a marked change of opinion between earlier writers on grammar who accepted the ūha of gender and later ones who redefined the term to exclude gender altogether. The effect of this denial of the ūha of gender on the woman&rsquo;s role in religious ritual is obvious: the majority of injunctions are in the masculine; the modification is not invoked; women are excluded.</p>
<p>Now let us look at this question in the specific context of a woman&rsquo;s right to sacrifice as discussed in the literature of the pūrvamīmāmsā school. The earliest work of the school is the Jaiminīyasūtra, written perhaps in the second century B.C.. The earliest commentary on Jaimini available to us is the Sabarabhāṣya, written in the fifth or sixth century A.D. Śabara himself is commented on by three different schools-founded by Kumārilabhaṭṭa, (Guru) Prabhakara, and Murārimiśra respectively—all of whom probably wrote in the seventh century. The overall aim of the purvamīmāmsā school was to protect the Veda from the onslaught of Buddhism and other heterodox systems by means of a detailed investigation of dharma as enjoined in Vedic texts. Jai.VI deals specifically with the qualifications necessary for a performer of the sacrifice. In doing so, it considers in particular the two classes of people that came to be excluded from such performance: sūdras and women. On the former issue, Jai.VI.1.25-38 declares that since the agnihotra and other such sacrifices are mentioned in the Veda only with reference to the three higher castes, the sudra is not entitled to perform sacrifices at all. Similarly, the Vedic texts regarding initiation do not include the sudra, and anyone not initiated into Vedic study is a priori unfit to perform sacrifices. Furthermore, these conclusions are endorsed by Sabara and his commentators.</p>
<p>The case for women is somewhat different. There is no suggestion that women are to be excluded from initiation or Vedic study:</p>
<p>[[42]]</p>
<p>unlike the sudra, therefore, they are not a priori unfit to perform sacrifices. However, ritual injunctions are invariably made in the masculine form. One question remains. Is this masculine form to be taken as a superordinate (meaning &lsquo;person&rsquo;, &lsquo;human&rsquo; etc.) or as a hyponym (meaning ‘male&rsquo; as opposed to &lsquo;female&rsquo;)? Jai.VI.1. 6–20 deals with this very point. The question is raised in connection with the classic injunction svargakāmo yajeta (&lsquo;he who desires heaven should perform sacrifices&rsquo;). The purvapakṣa or prima facie view states that since svargakāmo is in the masculine, the injunction applies only to men (lingaviseṣanirdeśāt pumyuktam; Jai.VI.1.6). Jaimini, however, insists that the masculine is intended here in its superordinate sense, applying to the class or genus (jāti) without distinction (aviseṣāt), always of course excepting the sudra. Thus women are also entitled to perform sacrifices (Jai.VI.1.8).</p>
<p>Let us take a closer look at the views of Jaimini&rsquo;s opponents. They base their exclusion of women from sacrifice on two grounds: first, on the denial of the ūha of gender; secondly, on the assertion that the performer of sacrifice must possess property which, according to them, a woman is unable to do. The latter point is supported by statements (e.g. Manu VIII. 416; see p. 277, note 10) that a woman cannot possess anything because what is hers belongs to her husband or father (cf. Tryambaka&rsquo;s comments on this topic in section IV, pp. 277-80 below). Moreover, she herself belongs to husband or father and is thus &lsquo;on the same level as property&rsquo; (strīnām dravyaiḥ samanayogitvāt; Jai.VI.1.10). Here Vedic texts are quoted describing the &lsquo;selling&rsquo; of a woman by her father to her husband (presumably in the arṣa form of marriage according to which the groom presents the bride&rsquo;s father with a cow and a bull; cf. PVK II.i.516-26; Menski 1984: 2.5.5.). For the exponents of this view, therefore, religious capacity depends on social position, specifically on the possession of wealth which is denied to women (Jai.VI.1.1012).</p>
<p>For Jaimini, however, social position is subordinated to religious aspiration which, he claims, is as strong in a woman as in a man (phalotsāhāviseṣāt; Jai.VI.1.13). His argument runs as follows. First, the crucial text must be interpreted according to the ūha of gender to read: &lsquo;If a woman truly desires heaven then she too should sacrifice.&rsquo; She should therefore proceed to acquire the necessary wealth (e.g. by spinning, cooking, etc., or by means of property received at marriage; cf. pp.277-80) in order to perform the sacrifice</p>
<p>[[43]]</p>
<p>(Śab.VI.1.13). Secondly, since this injunction is from the Veda (which for the purvamīmāmsaka is śruti; i.e. uncreated and eternally valid), it automatically overrules any smrti statement to the contrary (such as Manu VIII.416 cited above). Thirdly, statements to the effect that a woman owns no property, being non-injunctive, are mere arthavāda (i.e. exaggerated descriptions): they should therefore be interpreted in the more liberal, non-literal sense that a woman should not behave as if she were independent of her husband. If they were meant to be taken literally, then they would contradict the equally valid Vedic text declaring that the wife is mistress of the household property (Jai.VI.1.16; Śab.). Finally, Jaimini argues that marriage is a purely religious function and so cannot be considered a sale in the ordinary sense of the word. This, he claims, is shown by the fact that normally the price of an object fluctuates according to the value of that object, whereas the formal gift from husband to father (i.e. in the ārṣa form of marriage) remains the same regardless of the &lsquo;quality&rsquo; of the bride (Jai.VI.1.15-19).</p>
<p>In the pūrvamīmāmsā texts, such arguments win the day. For our purposes, however, the arguments of the purvapakṣin are of greater interest. For they provide the basis for the swing away from the religious freedom of women. In particular, the uha of gender is increasingly ignored and ritual texts are more often taken to apply only to men. In all kinds of ritual contexts, the male is invariably taken as the paradigm. When meditations are given on the body or when directions are given for ritual ablutions (e.g. in the Jayākhyasamhitā), it is always the male body that is described. In theory, a woman can invoke the ūha of gender; in practice, it is assumed that ritual information is really intended for the male.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising, therefore, that by the eighteenth century, orthodox religion excludes women from virtually all ritual activities. What is interesting is that Tryambaka feels free to invoke the uha of gender when it suits him to do so without any fear of the logical consequences. Presumably by the time he was writing, the issue debated with such feeling by Jaimini and Sabara had been forgotten. The question of whether the ūha of gender might be invoked in ritual contexts is now too ludicrous to be considered. In his detailed analysis of the daily duties implied by a woman&rsquo;s religious role (strīṇām āhnikam; see, pp. 44-245), and in the brief section on things to be avoided (varjanīyaḥ; see section IV, pp. 274–6), Tryambaka leaves no room for doubt.</p>

Following Yājà. and PT, I have restored suddhyeran (for suddheran; plural to include dvijātayah) and sprṣṭābhir (for sprṣṭvābhir; agreeing with adbhir, Yājñ.1.20b). Sakṛt, &lsquo;once&rsquo;, as opposed to three times as is the case for twice-born men.
