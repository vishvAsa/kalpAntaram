  <p>IV. The Duties Common to (all) Women (strīṇām sādhāraṇā dharmāḥ; Sdhp.22r.8-48v.6)</p>
<p>I shall present the remainder of Tryambaka&rsquo;s lengthy treatise in the form of a summary. This fourth section is divided into nine major topics, following Tryambaka&rsquo;s own rather loose subdivisions.</p>
<p>General rulings on behaviour (Sdhp.22r.9-25r.10)</p>
<p>Many of the quotations in this section have been quoted verbatim in earlier ones. For example, a woman should not expose her navel, ankles or breasts (Sdhp.22r.10-23v.1</p>
<p>=</p>
<p>Sdhp.7r.5-6, section IIA, p.90, note 69). She should wear haridrā, collyrium, kunkuma, sindūra, a short-sleeved bodice and so on (Sdhp.22v.5-7= Sdhp.7r.9-7v.1; section IIA, p.96, note 73). Without being told to do so, she should make ready all the items for worship (Sdhp.23r. 7-9 = Sdhp.12v.6-8, 4r.3-4; section IIC, p.179, note 35). She should eat her husband&rsquo;s left-overs, saying &lsquo;This is a great prasāda!&rsquo; (Sdhp.23r.9-10 = Sdhp.18r.6-7; section IIC, p.222, note 108). She should never be alone, nor bathe naked (Sdhp.23v.7 = Sdhp.6v.8; section IIA, p.84, note 63); and so on.</p>
<p>Others reinforce rulings already given and are discussed in the relevant sections. For example, she should never answer back even when scolded, nor show her anger or resentment even when beaten (Sdhp.23r.4-5; see section IID, pp.242-3). She should not go to festivals or public gatherings, on pilgrimages, or to such things as weddings or public shows (Sdhp.23v.2; see section IIB, p.137, note 38). If she wants to bathe in a sacred place, she should drink the water used to bathe her husband&rsquo;s feet, for her own husband is superior to even Śankara or Visnu (Sdhp.23v.10-24r.1; see section IIB, p. 137, note 39). The good wife never loves another man whether he bribes her with fine things, begs her humbly, or seizes her by force; if he looks at her, she does not meet his eyes; if he smiles at her, she does not smile back; if he speaks to her, she does not answer (Sdhp.24.1-5; see section IIC, p.175); and so on.</p>
<p>In addition, we may note the following rulings that are representative of this section. According to a quotation attributed to Āśvala</p>
<p>[[274]]</p>
<p>yana, the qualities of the ideal wife include &lsquo;devoted service to her parents-in-law and, especially, to her husband; co-operation with her husband in religious matters (dharmakarye &rsquo;nukulatvam); restraint in economic matters (arthakarye &lsquo;pi samyamam); bold confidence in sexual matters (prāgalhhyam kamakāryeṣu; cf. section IID, pp.237-8); cleanliness of body, an auspicious presence, and a gentle tongue&rsquo;.1 With regard to her husband, according to a quotation from the Rāmāyaṇa, ‘even if he is wicked, licentious or poverty-stricken, he is-for inherently noble womenthe supreme deity (paramam daivatam),&quot;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and her guru.3 &lsquo;When she sees him returning home from outside, therefore&rsquo;, according to a quotation attributed to the [Smṛti-]samgraha, ‘she should lovingly hurry to bring him water, food, betel, and a fan to cool him; then she should do such things as massage his feet and speak in an engaging or amorous way (cāṭuvacanaiḥ) so as to drive away his cares.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> The section ends with a well-known subhāṣita (attributed here to the [Smrti-]samgraha). &lsquo;A father gives within limits, a brother and son as well; but a husband&rsquo;s giving is unlimited-what wife will not worship him?&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Things to be avoided (varjanīyāḥ; Sdhp.25r.10-25v.6)</p>
<p>This is in fact an artificial subdivision. For although the quotations do indeed spell out the activities a good wife should avoid, the</p>
<p>[[275]]</p>
<p>section remains in effect a continuation of the earlier one on general behaviour. Three slokas in particular are worth recounting here, all of them unattributed by Tryambaka.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are the six things that corrupt women (nārīṇām dūṣaṇāni sat): drinking; keeping bad company; deserting one&rsquo;s husband (glossed by Tryambaka as &ldquo;sleeping in the house of someone other than one&rsquo;s husband&rdquo;); roaming around (on one&rsquo;s own); sleeping (glossed by Tryambaka as “sleeping in the daytime&quot;); and staying (i.e. spending time) in other people&rsquo;s homes.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Some of the aspects involved in &lsquo;keeping bad company&rsquo;—that is, the men and women with whom the good Hindu wife may not properly associate-are discussed in section IIC, pp.170-6). Since it is deemed necessary to begin each day by meditating with one&rsquo;s husband (see section IIA, pp.52-4), it makes sense that the conscientious wife never spends the night away from him. The question of whether or not she may sleep in the hottest part of the day after the midday meal is discussed briefly on page 49.</p>
<p>&lsquo;These are the six things that cause women and sūdras to fall (strīśūdrapatanāni ṣat): recitation (or repetition, i.e. of sacred texts; japa [h]); austerities (tapas); going on pilgrimages; renunciation (pravrajyā); the chanting of mantras (mantrasādhanam); and the worship of deities (devatārādhanam).”<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup> To this sloka we may add a similar one taken from section V, and attributed there to Aśvalāyana. ‘Śūdras are enjoined by Brahmā to serve the twice-born always, and likewise women to serve their own husbands. Women who are devoted to their husbands should never engage in japa recitation, austerities (tapas), offerings into fire (homa), religious donations (dāna), or any other religious observance (or vow; vrata) or ritual (makha), as long as their husbands are alive.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> The important implications of these slokas have been discussed in the</p>

<p>relevant sections. For example, the recitation of mantras (japa, mantrasādhana) is dealt with in the sections on devatadhyānam (IIA, pp.52–4), gomatimantra (pp.67–9), snānam (pp.82-8), samdhyā (IIB, pp.105-7), arghyadānam (pp.149-55), devapuja (IIC, pp.178-80), vaiśvadeva (pp.180–3), and strīsvabhāva (III, pp.246– 72). Going on pilgrimages (tīrthayatra) is discussed in section IIB (pp. 132-41); renunciation (pravrajya) in the section on parapurusa (pp. 170-6); the worship of deities (devatārādhanam) in the sections on devatādhyānam (pp.52-4), the goddess Śrī (pp.60-3), devapujā (pp.178-80), vaiśvadeva (180-3) and the goddess Jyesṭhā (pp.2279). Offerings into the fire (homa) are described in section IIB (pp. 1027, homa; and pp. 107-15, the role of the wife); religious donations (dāna) in the sections on managing the household accounts (pp.168– 70) and strīdhanam (IV, pp.277-80); religious vows or observances (vrata) in the sections on the role of the wife (IIB, pp.107–15) and strīsvabhāva (III, pp.246–72). The exclusion of women from Vedic education and ritual sacrifice in general is discussed in sections I (pp.34-9) and IIB (pp. 107-15). The assertion that, for women, household duties are the equivalent of performing the sacrifice is considered in the sections on daily duties (strīṇām āhnikam, pp.44– 50) and household tasks (IIC, pp.168–76); and the idea that serving one&rsquo;s husband is the equivalent of the Vedic student serving his guru in the section on paying obeisance to the husband (IIC, pp.162– 3). The question of what religious practices are open to a woman after her husband has died is discussed in the sections on sahagamanavidhi (IV, pp.291-8) and vidhavādharmaḥ (IV, pp.298–304).</p>
<p>Lastly, &rsquo;nothing should be done independently (svātantryena) by a woman, either as a child, a young girl or an old woman, even in her (own) home.&quot;<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> For, as Manu himself explains in the crucial following verses (omitted here by Tryambaka), she should be subject to her father in childhood, to her husband in her married life, and to her sons in widowhood (Manu V.148; see section IV, pp.299– 300). The rest of this brief section is predictable.</p>
<p>Women&rsquo;s property (strīdhanam; Sdhp.25v.6-27r.4)</p>
<p>Some aspects of this topic are discussed briefly in the approp</p>
<p>[[277]]</p>
<p>riate sections. Most important, perhaps, is the notion that the possession of property is a necessary prerequisite for the performance of sacrifice; and thus that the ineligibility of women to own anything (since they themselves are &lsquo;owned; see note 10) means that they have no right to perform sacrifice (see section I). In addition to this, the question of whether or not a wife may earn money is raised in section IIB (pp.132-41); the wife&rsquo;s responsibility to manage the household accounts in section IIC (pp.168-70); her right to make religious donations (dāna) in sections IIC (pp.168–70) and IV (pp.274-6). But such passages merely touch on what is an extremely complex topic pursued in great detail in numerous commentaries and digests. The problem here is how one may reconcile apparently conflicting rulings. Briefly, Tryambaka proceeds as follows.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there are a number of rulings that deny women the rights of ownership, inheritance and the independent disposal of property. According to an unattributed quotation (in fact taken from Manu), for example, &rsquo;these three-a wife, a son and a slave -are held to be without property ([a]dhanaḥ): whatever they acquire (or earn) is the property of him to whom they belong.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> According to śruti, women are powerless (nirindriyā) and without inheritance (adāyādiḥ; Sdhp.25v.7-8). According to another quotation from Manu (attributed here to Kātyāyana), ‘women should not set aside anything (for their own use) from the property of the joint family or even from their own property (svakād api ca vittād) without the permission of their husbands.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> Regarding a woman&rsquo;s lack of independence in such matters (tatra svātantryābhāve), Tryambaka quotes Hārīta. &lsquo;A woman is not entitled to independence (na strī svātantryam arhati) with regard to giving (dāne) or throwing (dhamane; lit. ‘blowing&rsquo; things) away, or with regard to any particular religious matter, or with regard to taking (ādāne; i.e.</p>
<p>(Manu); Sm.C.III.ii.p.584 (Manu); Subh.366/<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> (kimcid kāryam for kāryam kimcid).</p>
<p>[[278]]</p>
<p>something for her own use) or disposing (visarge; i.e. of things in general).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>
<p>On the other hand, according to another quotation attributed to Manu, there are six kinds of &lsquo;women&rsquo;s property&rsquo;. &lsquo;That which is given (to her) in the vicinity of the fire (at the marriage ceremony); that which is (given to her) when (she is) taken to her new husband&rsquo;s home; that which (is given to her by her husband) in the act of love; and that which (is given to her) by her mother, brother and father these are known as the sixfold property of women (sadvidham strīdhanam).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup> (For the application of the term strīdhanam to property acquired by the husband from the wife&rsquo;s family at the time of marriage, i.e. dowry, see Derrett 1984:185.) Tryambaka also points out that, according to Apastamba, &lsquo;If the wife makes an occasional religious donation (naimittike dāne) when her husband is away, this is not called &ldquo;theft&rdquo;.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup> Similarly, the epics frequently show women (such as Kausalya) who are described elsewhere as virtuous and yet who make donations apparently in their own right.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s conclusion follows Raghavananda&rsquo;s comment on Manu VIII.416 (quoted above, see note 10). The so-called &lsquo;independence&rsquo; of the wife, like that of the slave, is no independence at all. For the wife&rsquo;s right to her property implies the ownership of her husband too ((bhāryādhane bhartur api svāmitvāvagamāt; Sdhp.26 [1]v.2-3). What then is the difference between a wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;own property&rsquo; and that which is common to both wife and husband? With regard to the distribution of property owned jointly by the two of them, the wife needs her husband&rsquo;s permission but he does not need hers. With regard to the sixfold strīdhana, however, the right of ownership is all hers; but she still needs her husband&rsquo;s permission to exercise it.</p>
<p>[[1]]</p>
<p>[[279]]</p>
<p>For his part, he may use her property only if he has her permission. Indeed, as Tryambaka explains, ‘a husband should never seize (control of) his wife&rsquo;s property as long as she is alive; if he does so by force (balāt), he should be punished by the king.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref1:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> The quotation that follows-attributed to Madhava-extends the ruling to a woman&rsquo;s other male relatives. &lsquo;Neither husband, son, father nor brother has the power to take or dispose of a woman&rsquo;s property (strīdhana); if any one of them makes use of (lit. “enjoys&quot;) a woman&rsquo;s property without her permission (lit. &ldquo;by force&rdquo;), he should be made to give it back with interest (savṛddhikam) and he should incur punishment (dandam; e.g. a fine).&lsquo;16,<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>[[280]]</p>
<p>Tryambaka explains that when the epics describe virtuous women such as Kausalya or Sītā giving things away, the permission of their husbands is assumed. For without the husband&rsquo;s permission (bhartur ājñām vina), the wife should not give anything away, even to her own relatives (naiva svabandhubhyo diśed dhanam; Sdhp.27r. 2-3).</p>
<p>In praise of the pativratā (Sdhp.27r.4–33v.8)</p>
<p>This section consists almost entirely of quotations, including lengthy passages quoted verbatim from the Mahabharata and the Agnipurāna. Many of the individual rulings are also given earlier in the relevant contexts. In this section, apart from the theme of the proper behaviour of wives, there is virtually no thread of argument.</p>
<p>The first series of ŝlokas are attributed to ‘other smrti texts&rsquo; (Sdhp.27r.5-27v.4; smṛtyantaram), the second to the Agnipurāṇa (Sdhp.27v.4-10). Both merely reinforce points that Tryambaka has made elsewhere.</p>
<p>The third series consists of two entire chapters quoted verbatim from Draupadi&rsquo;s conversation with Satyabhama in the Vanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp.27v.10-31v.7&lt; Mbh.III.222–3). Satyabhāmā asks Draupadi how she has managed to gain such control over her husbands (the five Pandavas) that they are never angry with her. 18 What is her secret? Is it the result of &lsquo;a religious observance (or vow; vrata); (the practice of) austerities (tapas); bathing (in sacred waters; snānam); (reciting) a mantra (or spell); (using) herbs (with magical properties); the (magic) power of knowledge (vidyāvīryam); the (magic) power attained by (using special) roots (mūlavīryam); japa recitation; offerings into the fire (homa); or the (tantric rituals described in) āgama texts (āgamā[h])&rsquo;?[^19] Draupadī rejects all such methods as appropriate only to wicked women (cf. pp.274-6 above); for drinking the water used to bathe one&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s feet as the proper alternative to bathing in a sacred place, see section IIB, pp.134-8. &lsquo;My husbands have come under my</p>
<p>[[281]]</p>
<p>control,&rsquo; she explains, &lsquo;as a result of my attentiveness, my eternal readiness to serve, and my devoted services to my elders.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup> Draupadi then proceeds to enumerate all the familiar qualities of the pativratā. They may be summed up in one sloka. &lsquo;There is no deity like himthat is, like one&rsquo;s husband-in all the god-filled worlds; when he is pleased, through his grace (prasādāt) all desires are fulfilled; when angered, he kills.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></p>
<p>The fourth set of rulings, attributed to the Agnipurāṇa, is taken from Krsna&rsquo;s advice to his younger sister, Subhadra, on the eve of her marriage (Sdhp.31v.7-32r.2). His main point is that she should &lsquo;forget all about us (i.e. her own family), even her mother and father. For the husband alone is a woman&rsquo;s family; the husband alone is a woman&rsquo;s wealth; the husband alone is a woman&rsquo;s religious duty, and her chief austerity.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup> The importance of forgetting one&rsquo;s own family and never returning to one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s house is taken up again at some length later in this section (p.288)</p>
<p>The fifth passage is taken, with some omissions, from the conversation between Umã and Mahesvara in the Anusāsanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp.32r.2-33r.2 Mbh.XIII.134.32-3,34b</p>
<p>5, 36b, 38–41, 43, 45–52a, 53-5). It opens with Uma&rsquo;s statement that &rsquo;the religious duty of a woman (strīdharmah) is created at the outset, that is, at the time of marriage, by her relatives: in the presence of the (marriage) fire, she becomes her husband&rsquo;s partner in the religious sphere (sahadharmacarī).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup> Umā then enumerates the qualities of the ideal wife who &lsquo;participates in the religious duty of her husband&rsquo; (dharmacāriṇī, dharmabhāginī), who &rsquo;takes his vow</p>
<p>[[282]]</p>
<p>as her own&rsquo; (pativratā, pativratabhāginī; see pp.50, 107-15 etc.). Above all, &rsquo;the good woman always regards her husband as a god&hellip;. For the husband is god for women; the husband is family; the husband is the goal. There is no goal, no deity like the husband.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Umā also touches on what is a new theme for Tryambaka. ‘If for some reason a husband tells (his wife to do) something that is (normally) not to be done (akāryam), something that is against dharma (adharmam), or something that causes death (prānanāśanam), then—even if he is poor or sick or in trouble or in the midst of enemies, even if he is suffering from a brahmin&rsquo;s curse (e.g. Pāṇḍu; see section V, pp.309–10)—she should do it without hesitation, bearing in mind the (special) duties (enjoined) for difficult times (āpaddharman).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> Tryambaka returns to this important issue in his conclusion.</p>
<p>The final extended quotation is taken, with few omissions, from Bhisma&rsquo;s conversation with Yudhisthira on the behaviour of good women in the Anusasanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp. 33r.2-33v.8 &lt; Mbh.XIII.12.1-3a, 6b-21; see also section III, pp. 247-8, 268). Bhisma in turn recalls another conversation: that between Sumanā and Sandilī, the renowned pativratā, when the two women meet in heaven (devaloka). Asked what meritorious behaviour has brought her there, Sandili stresses that ‘it was not by wearing the ochre robe (kaṣāya; i.e. of the renunciate), the bark garments (valkala; i.e. of the hermit), the shaven head (mundā; i.e. of certain types of religious mendicants, or the widow), or the matted locks (jaṭilā; i.e. of the ascetic) that [she] became a deity (i.e. entitled to be in devaloka).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup> She simply followed the dictates of her religious duty to her husband (patidharma; Sdhp.33v.7 Mbh.XIII. 124.21). Tryambaka&rsquo;s repeated insistence that the good wife should</p>
<p>[[283]]</p>
<p>have nothing to do with female renouncers, mendicants or ascetics is discussed in more detail in section IIC (pp. 170-6). The question of whether or not the widow should shave her head is dealt with below (pp.303-4).</p>
<p>The religious duties of the menstruating woman (rajasvalādharmah; Sdhp. 33v.8-40r.3)</p>
<p>This is a somewhat loosely structured section that touches on most of the points normally made concerning the menstruating woman. She herself is referred to in a variety of ways that reflect the range of implications usually associated with her condition. For example, she is described as &lsquo;full of impurity&rsquo; (rajasvalā); &lsquo;one whose clothes are stained&rsquo; (malavadvāsas); ‘overflowing with menstrual blood&rsquo; (ārtavābhiplutā); &lsquo;bearing flowers&rsquo; or &lsquo;in bloom&rsquo; (puspini, puspavati); &lsquo;one who has the duty or condition of women&rsquo; (strīdharminî); and so on.</p>
<p>The first and most important point that Tryambaka makes is that &rsquo;the menstruating woman is impure for three (days and) nights.”<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup> In a later passage, he produces a famous quotation, attributed to the [Smṛti-]samgraha. &lsquo;On the first day, she is declared to be (as polluting as) an untouchable; on the second, (as polluting as) a brahmin-killer; on the third, (as polluting as) a washerwoman; on the fourth day, she is purified.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> The significance of this impurity, and the traditional tracing of its origins to the story of Indra&rsquo;s brahminicide, are discussed in section III. For the symbolic &lsquo;menstrual pollution&rsquo; of rivers and the earth, see Salomon 1984:157-8, 173-5.</p>
<p>In this section, Tryambaka uses a quotation attributed to the Smṛticandrikā to explain that the menstruating woman loses two kinds of blood, one far more polluting than the other. &ldquo;That which occurs to women at the wrong time (i.e. outside the crucial three days described above) men call &ldquo;blood&rsquo; (raktam); that which occurs at the</p>
<p>[[284]]</p>
<p>right time (i.e. within those three days) is called &ldquo;menstrual blood” (rajas); as a result of the latter alone, she becomes impure. For women (who continue to bleed from the fourth) until the twelfth day, the purification (appropriate) for urine is required; a ritual bath is (prescribed for those who bleed from the twelfth) until the eighteenth day; after that, she is (again) impure for three days (i.e. it is assumed that another cycle has begun). &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> Another quotation, attributed to Angiras, provides a more detailed definition. &lsquo;The best of wise men know that the menstruation (rajas) of women is of four kinds: that which is due to illness (rogajam); that which is due to (a disturbance of) the emotions (rāgajam); that which is due to (an imbalance of) the humours (dhātujam); and that which occurs at the right time (of the monthly cycle; i.e. during the crucial three days). &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup> Both Angiras and Tryambaka conclude that only the fourth type of bleeding makes a woman ritually impure (aśuddha; Sdhp.35v.5). One can only speculate on the reasons behind this careful categorization of the polluting powers of menstrual fluid: the importance of establishing a pregnancy certainly (see below, pp.287-8); a desire to take the initiative out of the hands of woman perhaps; or merely an obsession with classification.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are innumerable prohibitions relating to the menstruating woman (Sdhp.33v.9-34r.4). For example, she should not use collyrium for her eyes (cf. section IIA, pp.96-101), comb her hair (cf. section IIA, pp.96-7), massage her body with oil or ointments (cf. sections IIA, pp.96-7, and IID, pp.236-45, or take a bath (cf. section IIA, pp.82-8). She should not clean her teeth (cf. section IIA, pp.78-82), ot cut her nails. She should not ‘touch fire&rsquo; (nāgnim spṛśet, i.e. cook; cf. sections IIA, pp.100–1, and IIC, pp.198-205). She should eat only those foods which are fit for sacrifice (havisyam; cf. Dh.kośa III.ii.1180, 1216, 1265, 1270-3, 1287-8 etc.; PVK II.i. p.681) and she should use either her own cupped hands (añjalinā vā pibet; i.e. like a renouncer, cf. pāṇipātrin, kārapātrin, Yatidh.32.85; Olivelle 1977:37, 164-8) or a</p>
<p>parato &lsquo;suciḥ // Sdhp.35v.6-9 (Sm.C) &lt; ?</p>
<p>[[285]]</p>
<p>copper or iron vessel (or, according to some authorities, an unbaked earthenware vessel or one made of leaves; see section IIC, pp.217-21). She should certainly not eat food from her husband&rsquo;s plate (patipātre &rsquo;nnam; cf. ucchista, section IIC, pp.221-7). She should not even look at her husband (pasyed api patim na ca). She should not sleep on a high bed (cf. section IID, pp.239-40). She should not spin thread, plait or cut rope, or dig in the earth. She should not cry, laugh, talk a great deal, hear loud noises, run, roam about, exert herself, sleep in the daytime, sit in a draught; and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>These prohibitions are frequently coupled with the defects accruing to her child if she disobeys. In most instances, the link between action and defect is clear. For example, if she uses collyrium, her child will be blind in one or both eyes; if she combs her hair, he will be bald. If she massages her body with oil, he will have a skin disease (duścarmā); if she takes a bath, he will die by drowning (apsu mārukaḥ). If she cleans her teeth, his teeth will be discoloured; if she cuts her nails, his nails will be diseased. Similarly, if she plaits rope, her child will hang himself (udbandhanamṛtah). If she laughs, his palate, teeth, lips and tongue will be discoloured. If she talks a great deal, he will be a chatterbox (pralāpī); if she hears a loud noise, he will be deaf. If she runs, he will be unstable (cañcalaḥ); if she roams about, he will be insane (unmattah). If she sleeps in the daytime, he will be sleepy by nature.</p>
<p>However, some of the links are less obvious. For example, if she drinks out of an earthenware vessel (kharva, śarāva), her child will be a dwarf (kharva, vāmana; a pun). If she eats food from her husband&rsquo;s plate, her child will be insane (unmādī). If she spins (krnatti), or cuts rope, he will be impotent (klībaḥ; or perhaps of indeterminate sex); a possible allusion to spinning or cutting the &rsquo;thread&rsquo; of progeny that a man is duty bound to continue (kulatantu; samtanārtham, Manu IX.96; etc.). If she digs in the earth, he will be bald or his life will be short. If she sits in a draught, he will be insane (unmattaḥ). Most important of all, if a menstruating woman makes love during the crucial three days, her child will be an untouchable (candalaḥ) or cursed (abhiśastaḥ; i.e. condemned for committing a mahāpātaka). Hence the detailed prohibitions to ensure that the menstruating woman is neither available nor attractive to her husband at this time (cf. section IIA, pp.88-96 and 96-101).</p>
<p>Thirdly, there are a number of special rulings to deal with different</p>
<p>[[286]]</p>
<p>kinds of coincidences. For example, while there is a prohibition on bathing in general (snānamātraniṣedhe &lsquo;pi) during menstruation, the ritual bath prescribed for a specific occasion (naimittikam snānam; see section IIA, pp.82-3) must still be performed, but in some other way. (The menstruating woman should somehow sprinkle her body with water without getting her clothes wet; Sdhp.35r.4-7.) Similarly, what additional rite of expiation (prayascitta) should be performed by a menstruating woman who is further polluted by contact with an untouchable (caṇḍāla, śvapāka), an inferior sūdra (antya, antyaja; i.e. the lower-caste or untouchable śūdra), an outcaste (patita, i.e. one guilty of a mahāpātaka), a dog or a crow (the candālas of the animal and bird kingdoms) (The answer depends both on which day the contact occurred and on whether she was eating at the time; Sdhp.36v.2-7.) What should a woman do if she begins to menstruate when she is already in a state of impurity due to a birth or a death in the family? (She should have water poured on her head by a brahmin; Sdhp.36v.7–9.) What should she do if, while menstruating herself, she touches or is touched by another menstruating woman? (The answer depends on the varṇa of the two women involved, who is responsible for making contact, and whether that contact was intentional or prolonged; Sdhp.36v.9-37r.10.)</p>
<p>Fourthly, there are the rulings for the ritual bath of purification on the fourth day (Sdhp.36r.1-36v.1, 37r.10-37v.7). Towards the end of the morning (samgave; see p.45) on the fourth day, she should cleanse herself with sixty lumps of earth; if she is a widow, with twice that number (cf. section IIA, pp.71-4). Then she should clean her teeth (cf. section IIA, pp.78-82), and take a ritual bath with her clothes on (sacelam; cf. section IIA, pp.82-8). Pure once more, she should gaze at the sun (bhāskaram dṛṣṭvā), pray for a son (putram prarthya), and attend to her woman&rsquo;s duties (strī dharmam &hellip; samācaret). According to a quotation attributed to Atri, &lsquo;when she has bathed properly, she should look at her husband&rsquo;s face and no one else&rsquo;s, or (if he is away) she should look at the sun while meditating on her husband in her mind.&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> That evening, she should make sexual advances to her husband (upasarpati; Sdhp.40r.1). A quotation attributed to the Agni</p>
<p>[[287]]</p>
<p>purāna is more explict. ‘Anointed with unguents of ground turmeric (haridra) and saffron (kunkuma; cf. section IIA, pp.96-101), wearing bright garments, thinking of her husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;lotus foot&rdquo; (patipādābjam; i.e. with the reverence due to one&rsquo;s guru or god; cf. sections IIC, pp.156–68, 221–7, and IID,pp.236–45), gazing at her own toes (i.e. keeping her eyes down), not looking at other men, thinking only of her husband, thinking of him as light itself (bhargam eva), always (keeping herself) pure (i.e. by taking care not to touch anything polluting), beautifully dressed and ornamented (bhūṣitā) and anointed with perfume (cf. section IIA, pp.88–101), and in good spirits (sumanāḥ), she should go to bed (see section IID, pp.236–45).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> If bleeding continues after the fourth day, she is considered &lsquo;fit to be touched&rsquo; (sparśayogya; Sdhp.36r.8) and therefore pure with regard to her husband (suddha bhartu[h]; Sdhp.36г. 5); that is, she should still make love to him. Until her menstrual flow has ceased altogether, however, she is not held to be &lsquo;of pure conduct&rsquo; (sādhvācārā; Sdhp.36r.6) and therefore she is not &lsquo;fit to perform the ritual worship of the gods and so on&rsquo; (daivādikarmayogy[ā]; Sdhp.36r.7-8).</p>
<p>Finally, there are the rulings concerning the importance of making love at the proper time (ṛtukāladharma) and the penalties or atonements (prāyaścitta) enjoined for both husband and wife if they fail to take advantage of this opportunity to conceive (Sdhp.37v. 7-38r.5, 39v.10-40r.3; cf. nagnikā, section IIA, pp.86-8). The penalties described are in fact those normally advocated for adultery. Apastamba provides an example. ‘A man who fails in his duty to his wife should put on the skin of a donkey with the hair turned outwards and go to seven houses calling (out to each in turn): “(Give) alms to a man who has failed in his duty to his wife!.&rdquo; And this should be his livelihood for six months.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup> A variety of penalties may be imposed on the wife who refuses to make love; and again these are penalties mainly associated with adultery (cf. section III).</p>
<p>[[288]]</p>
<p>According to Āpastamba, she should perform the severe twelve-day kṛcchra penance (see Manu XI.211; Vas.23.43; PVK IV.p.132,145) for six months (Sdhp.37v.9–10 &lt; Āp.I.10.28.20). According to the Brahmandapurāna, she should be abandoned (parityājyā; Sdhp. 38r.3-4). According to Manu, &rsquo;the king should have her devoured by dogs in a (public) place where many people have gathered (to watch).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup> In her next life, according to an unattributed quotation, she will be reborn as a bitch, a she-wolf, a female jackal or a female hog (Sdhp.39v.10-40r.1; for the retention of gender in transmigration, see sections IIC, p.226, and III, pp.246-7). According to Baudhāyana, her husband should proclaim her publicly to be a foetus-killer (bhrūnaghnīm; cf. section IIC, pp.217-21) and drive her out of his house (Sdhp.38r.4-5 &lt; Baudh.IV.1.22; Dh.kosa I.ii. 1019).</p>
<p>Tryambaka interprets this last ruling to mean that she should be sent back to her father. He then devotes considerable space to proving that the good wife never returns to her father&rsquo;s house (Sdhp.38r.5-39v.10). His evidence includes lengthy quotations taken from the Rgvedic marriage hymn (R.V.X.85 and commentary), the Yajurveda (and commentary), the Drāhyāyaṇaśrautasūtra (and commentary), and the Sakuntala story from both the Mahābhārata and Kālidāsa. The conclusion is clear. &lsquo;People suspect a married woman who spends time with her own relations and, even if she is chaste, (they assume) otherwise; that is why (even) her own relatives insist that she remain near her husband, even if he does not like her. &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> As Kanva explains to Sakuntala, &rsquo;even slavery (dāsyam api) in your husband&rsquo;s house is right (kṣamam)&rsquo; (Sdhp.39v.8</p>
<p>Abhijñānasakuntalam V.27).</p>
<p>The religious duties of the pregnant woman (garbhiṇīdharmāḥ; Sdhp.40r.3-42r.1)</p>
<p>First, Tryambaka gives a number of rulings, largely prohibitions,</p>
<p>[[289]]</p>
<p>relating to the proper behaviour of the pregnant woman. Many of them are given elsewhere in the more general context of the good wife. For example, even if the pregnant woman-who is naturally tired at this time as a result of the weight of the unborn child (garbhabharālasāyāḥ svabhāvataḥ) — abandons all other ornamentation, she should not abandon those things which are associated with the woman whose husband is still alive: that is, haridrā, collyrium and so on (Sdhp.41r.4-7; cf. section IIA, p.96, note 73). Similarly, she should perform the popular naktavrata that involves a morning bath, a pūjā to Pārvatī (the model of the devoted wife; see section I), and eating only at night (Sdhp.40v.2).</p>
<p>Some rulings are more specific to pregnancy. For example, the pregnant woman should avoid such things as riding elephants and horses, climbing hills or onto housetops (kuñjarāśvādiśailaharmyādirohanam), strenuous physical exertion (vyāyāmam), walking fast (sighragamanam), riding in a cart (sakaṭārohanam), bloodletting (raktavimokṣam), and so on (Sdhp.40v.3-5). If she obeys these rules, she will have a son who lives for a long time and is very wealthy (putraḥ sthirāyur vṛddhisamyutah); if she does not, she will cause a miscarriage (garbhapatanam avapnoti; Sdhp.40v.6-7). The ruling that a pregnant woman should avoid sexual intercourse (&hellip; vyavāyam ca garbhiṇī varjayet sadā; Sdhp.41r.3-4) is somewhat at odds with the widespread idea that-due to the boon granted to women by Indra when they agreed to take on part of the guilt of his brahminicide (see section III, pp.250-1)—if a woman wants to make love, her husband should not refuse, right up to the delivery of her child (Yājñ.I.81, Mit.; Tait.Sam.II.5.1.4-5; etc.).</p>
<p>Secondly, Tryambaka deals with the importance of indulging a pregnant woman&rsquo;s cravings (dohadapradānam; Sdhp.41r.9). He quotes Yajnavalkya. ‘As a (direct) result of not indulging the craving of a pregnant woman, the foetus acquires some defect (doṣam); that is, some deformity (vairūpyam) or even death. That is why what women desire (when they are pregnant) should be done. &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Even if she wants something that is bad (ahitam) for her, she should</p>
<p>[[290]]</p>
<p>be given it: a little is in this case good or at least somewhat good (hitopahitam alpakam, Sdhp.41v.3&lt; Astāngahṛdayam, śarīrasthānam 1.53b; cf. Obeyesekere 1963:340-1). The reasoning behind this derived here from the medical authority, Vāgbhata—is that the heart is one of the &lsquo;soft&rsquo; organs bequeathed by the mother (for the others, see Jolly 1901:81). &lsquo;For (the child&rsquo;s) heart is born of its mother (mātrjam) and is (thus closely) linked with its mother&rsquo;s heart; it is therefore not right to deny the cravings (śraddhāvimānanam) of the pregnant woman.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup> For in indulging the mother, one is in fact indulging the child. The cravings felt by the mother are thus in reality those of the foetus for all that it experienced in its former life (Jolly 1901:77). Medical texts derive dohada from dvaihṛdaya, ‘twohearted&rsquo;, on the grounds that the hearts of mother and foetus are linked in this way.</p>
<p>Two points may be made here. First, this close relationship between the hearts of mother and child supports the idea that the half-breed demon priest inherits his mother&rsquo;s demonic heart (or svabhāva; see section III, p.266). Secondly, the dohada or craving of the pregnant woman is a recurrent motif in South Asian culture and folklore. More important, it can provide a graphic (but culturally acceptable) expression of a woman&rsquo;s hostility towards her husband, her ambivalence towards her child, and her resentment regarding the traditional role of women in society (cf. Bloomfield 1920; Tawney 1924:1, appendix III; Obeyesekere 1963).</p>
<p>Finally, Tryambaka describes the entry of the pregnant woman into the lying-in chamber (sūtikāgāra veśanam; Sdhp.41v.4-42r.1). She should be led into this special room where all that is necessary has been gathered together (sambhāraiḥ sambhṛtam; Sdhp.41v.9; cf. Jolly 1901:82-3) in or before the ninth month, or even at the moment of giving birth (prasūtisambhave kale sadyo vāpi; Sdhp. 41v.5), at a suitably auspicious time, and with a ceremony to bring good luck (kṛtakautukamangalām; Sdhp.41v.10). Moreover, she should hold in her hand a fruit that has a masculine name (hastastha</p>
<p>[[291]]</p>
<p>punnāmaphalām; Sdhp.41v.10) in order to encourage the birth of a</p>
<p>son.</p>
<p>The religious duties of the woman whose husband is away (proṣitabhartṛkādharmāḥ; Sdhp.42r.1–3).</p>
<p>This brief section quotes two well-known but here unascribed rulings, without comment. &lsquo;When her husband has gone to another country, the chaste woman (sati) should forego perfumes, garlands, collyrium, (using) the teeth-cleaning stick and (chewing) betel.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup> &lsquo;The woman whose husband is away should abandon playing, adorning her body, attending gatherings and festivals, laughing, and going to other people&rsquo;s houses.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup> Mit. on Yājñ.I.84 glosses ‘playing&rsquo; (krīdām) as ‘with a ball and so on&rsquo; (kandukādibhiḥ), ‘attending festivals&rsquo; ([u]tsavo) as &lsquo;marriages and so on&rsquo; (vivāhādiḥ), and &rsquo;laughing&rsquo; (hāsyam) as &lsquo;with the mouth open&rsquo; (vijṛmbhaṇam). Such are the self-imposed deprivations implied by Draupadi when she tells Satyabhāmā that she always observes a &lsquo;vow&rsquo; (bhavāmi vratacāriṇi) when her husband(s) is (are) away (Sdhp.29r.9&lt; Mbh. III.222.29; see section IV, pp.280-1). The implications of the individual items of beautification and personal hygiene have been discussed earlier in the appropriate sections.40</p>
<p>The injunction relating to dying (literally &lsquo;going&rsquo;) with (one&rsquo;s husband) (sahagamanavidhih; Sdhp.42r.3-45r.5)</p>
<p>Of the nine topics discussed in this section on the duties common to all women, this is perhaps the most interesting. For in 1789,</p>
<p>[[292]]</p>
<p>&lsquo;suttee&rsquo; was officially noted by the government of Bengal. The campaign against the custom, led by Rammohan Roy (1772-1833), met with considerable hostility from the orthodox community (see Anantarāma&rsquo;s Sahānumaranaviveka).41 In 1829, Suttee Regulation XVII made the practice illegal. In 1830, eight hundred Hindu conservatives appealed to the Privy Council on the grounds that the Act interfered with Indian culture and religion. In 1832, the prosuttee appeal was rejected. In the Maratha court of Thanjavur in the mid-eighteenth century, however, the orthodox position was still maintained. Tryambaka presents it as follows.</p>
<p>He begins with two resounding quotations that advocate the practice of sahagamana. First, &lsquo;at the time of a girl&rsquo;s wedding, the brahmins should recite (these words): &ldquo;May you be one who accompanies her husband (always,) when he is alive and even when he is dead!&rdquo;&rsquo;&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> Secondly, according to Sankha, ‘if, when her husband has died, a woman ascends with (him; samarohe[t]) into the fire, she is glorified in heaven as one whose conduct is equal to that of Arundhati.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<p>Tryambaka next considers the objection (nanu&hellip;) that sahagamana is in fact a form of suicide, and therefore prohibited (ātmahatyārūpatvena niṣiddhatvāt; Sdhp.42r.6-7). Of the two quotations given to support this objection, the first is the standard pūrvapakṣa against suicide. ‘And therefore one should certainly not depart (this life) before its full length (has been lived out).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> The second is Iś. Up.3, together with the common misinterpretation of the phrase ātmahano janaḥ to mean &lsquo;people who kill themselves&rsquo; instead of</p>
<p>[[293]]</p>
<p>&lsquo;people who kill (i.e. are ignorant of) the (true) Self&rsquo; (cf. Radhakrishnan 1974:570; Hume 1971:361, note 4; PVK II.ii.p.927, Vāj.S.40.3). Tryambaka argues that this objection is invalid because the prohibition on suicide is a general rule (sāmānyavacana) and is therefore open to modification by supplementary rules giving the exceptions to it (viseṣa). Just as the general rule that ‘one should not desire to kill any living being&rsquo; is modified by supplementary rules-for example, that in certain rituals an animal should be sacrificed-so the general prohibition on suicide is also modified by supplementary rules. These include rulings related to the religious suicide of the ascetic who kills himself at a sacred place in order to go directly to heaven (cf. Yatidh.17.1–32; Olivelle 1977:42-3, 96-8); the deliberate courting of death in battle by the heroic warrior (cf. Yatidh.17.8; Olivelle 1977:97); and—according to Tryambaka—the self-immolation of the widow on her husband&rsquo;s funeral pyre (Sdhp.42r.8-42v.8).</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s second argument in favour of the practice is that &lsquo;dying with one&rsquo;s husband (bhartranumaranam) is recommended for women because it brings great rewards.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> Although not spelled out, the crucial issue here is whether the ritual act of sahagamana is naimittika (i.e. required by the particular &lsquo;occasion&rsquo;; in this case, by the husband&rsquo;s death) or kamya (i.e. to be performed only if one desires the rewards accruing to the action; cf. nitya, naimittika and kāmya in the context of ritual baths, section IIA, p.82). If it is naimittika, the widow must join her husband on his pyre; if it is kāmya, she only needs to do so if she wants to enjoy the &lsquo;great rewards&rsquo; promised by the scriptures. Tryambaka evidently admits that sahagamana is a kāmya act and therefore entirely a matter for the individual widow to decide. However, his repeated assertion that it is to be recommended (ślaghyam, prasastah), together with his daunting descriptions of the only alternative open to the widow who remains alive (see below, pp.298-304), makes his own opinion on the question abundantly clear.</p>
<p>He proceeds to quote numerous slokas describing the &lsquo;great rewards&rsquo; in store for the pious widow who chooses to die. I have selected some of the more memorable examples. &lsquo;The husband is to be followed always (sahānuyātavy[aḥ]): like the body by its shadow, like the moon by moonlight, like a thundercloud by</p>
<p>[[294]]</p>
<p>lightning.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup> &ldquo;There is no doubt that the woman who follows (anuvrajanti) her husband gladly from his house to the cremation ground attains with every step the reward(s) of the horse-sacrifice.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> &lsquo;Just as the snake-catcher drags the snake from its hole by force, even so the virtuous wife (sati) snatches her husband from the demons of hell and takes him up to heaven.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> &lsquo;Yama&rsquo;s messengers recognize a virtuous wife (satīm) from afar and take to flight. Even if her husband has been an evil man, they let go of him at once, exclaiming, &ldquo;When we see a devoted wife (pativratām) hurtling towards us (to rescue her husband), we messengers (of Death) are less afraid of fire and lightning than we are of her!&rdquo;&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup> &lsquo;There are 34 crores of hairs on a person&rsquo;s body: she who dies with (anugacchati) her husband will dwell in heaven for the same length of time.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> &lsquo;(Even in the case of) a husband who has entered into hell (itself) and who-seized by the servants of Death and bound with terrible bonds—has arrived at the very place of torment (vātanāsthānam); (even if he is already) standing there, helpless and</p>
<p>[[295]]</p>
<p>wretched, quivering (with fear) because of his evil deeds;<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup> even if he is a brahmin-killer or the murderer of a friend, or if he is ungrateful for some service done for him — (even then) a woman who refuses to become a widow (avidhavā nāri) can purify him: in dying, she takes him with her.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> Tryambaka concludes that &lsquo;according to established custom as shown in the eloquent statements (given above), this (act of) dying with (one&rsquo;s husband; anumaraṇam) when put into practice by a devoted wife (pativrataya)-confers great blessings on both (wife and husband).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup></p>
<p>Tryambaka now considers the rewards accruing to the bad wife. &lsquo;If (this act of dying with one&rsquo;s husband is) put into practice by a sinful woman, it brings about the destruction of that sin.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> The quotation that follows is quite clear. &lsquo;Women who, due to their wicked minds, have previously (i.e. until then) despised their husbands, and who have always behaved disagreeably towards those husbands, who (though) being of that kind (yet) at the (appropriate) time perform the (ritual act of) dying with their husbands (bhartrānumaraṇam) — whether (they do this) of their own free will, or out of anger, or even out of fear-all of them are purified (of sin).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> This is the scriptural justification for forcing women to burn themselves. Whatever their reason for doing so, whatever the past</p>
<p>[[296]]</p>
<p>deeds of either husband or wife; the sacrifice purifies both of them. &lsquo;As a result of this (ruling),&rsquo; Tryambaka concludes, &lsquo;when sahagamana is performed by a woman who has done wrong—that is, what her husband did not like (cf. section V)-throughout her lifetime, (then) it is said to have the quality of a prayaścitta.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> In this sense, it is the ultimate, and only effective, prāyaścitta for the bad wife.</p>
<p>As Tryambaka admits, however, this conclusion conflicts with the special rulings relating to the kali age (Sdhp.43v.1-3; cf. kalivarjya, PVK III. p.926-68). One of these is that the rite of atonement that culminates in death (maraṇāntikaprāyaścitta) is prohibited in the kali age. The quotation is unambiguous. These duties (i.e. those listed in the previous unquoted passages) are to be avoided in the kali age, say learned men; as is the prescribing to brahmins of any rite of atonement (prāyaścitta) that culminates in death.&rsquo;[^57] Tryambaka merely sidesteps the problem, remarking that whether or not the bad wife should perform sahagamana to wipe out her sins is best left to great men to decide (kartavyam na kartavyam iti mahadbhir vivecanīyam; Sdhp.43v.3).</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s weakness as a mīmāmsaka is evident. For there are two crucial issues here: whether or not sahagamana is really a prāyaścitta for the bad wife; and, if so, whether this particular maraṇāntikaprāyaścitta is in fact prohibited in the kali age. Tryambaka argues neither well. Instead, he embarks on a lengthy (and poorly structured) explanation of why it is important for a wife to behave properly during her and her husband&rsquo;s lifetime (Sdhp.43v. 3-44v.3). If there is no maranantikaprāyaścitta for the errant wife, then she cannot escape the torments awaiting her in the next world. For-according to a variety of quotations-even if she has bathed in all the sacred places, the bad wife will go to the hell of dung and</p>
<p>vāpi sarvāḥ pūtā bhavanty uta // Sdhp.43r.7-9 (Mbh.)&lt;Sm.M.I.p.163 (pratikūlatāh for  ̊gāh; bhayān mohāt for bhayad vāpi; Vyāsasātātapaḥ); Par.M.II. i.p.58 (as Sm.M. except tu for ca; bhavanti tāḥ for bhavanty uta; Mbh.); Mbh.XIII appendix 1 no.15, 4660-3, 4665-6. Cf. Saha.1.2 (as Par.M. except ca for tu).</p>
<p>[[297]]</p>
<p>urine (viṇmūtre narake), or burning oil (taptatailanarakam); she will be a widow, or a bitch, or a sow in her next life; she will be infested with worms in this one; and so on. Since statements such as these make no reference to any other prayaścitta that can wipe out the effects of a wife&rsquo;s bad behaviour (prāyaścittāntarābhāvāc ca sarvathā; Sdhp.44r. 10-44v.1), Tryambaka suggests that there is none (that is, he implies, none other than sahagamana). The wife&rsquo;s only hope is to worship and placate her husband at every turn. The inadequacy of Tryambaka&rsquo;s reasoning on this point becomes clear when one compares it with, for example, that in the Mitākṣarā on Yajñ.III.226. Tryambaka&rsquo;s intention, however, is transparent. He is evidently suggesting that, despite the rulings regarding the kali age, sahagamana is in fact the safest course of action for the not-soperfect wife.</p>
<p>[[959]]</p>
<p>Tryambaka raises one final question. &lsquo;Now the objection may be made (nanu) that this (practice of) dying with one&rsquo;s husband (anugamanam) is applicable to kṣatriya women and so on (i.e. to the lower varṇas), but prohibited to brahmin women.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> Several quotations are produced in favour of this view. For example, ‘as a result of Brahma&rsquo;s instruction, following one&rsquo;s husband when he has died (mṛtānugamanam) is not appropriate) for brahmin women; but, for the other varnas, this is held to be the supreme duty for women. Or, &rsquo;the brahmin woman who does not die with her husband, (even though she is) distracted by grief, obtains the goal of renunciation (pravrajyā; glossed by Tryambaka as brahmacaryam; i.e. vidhavādharma, see below); (whereas) by dying, she becomes one who has committed suicide (ātmaghātinī; i.e. she incurs the sin thereof).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> According to Tryambaka, however, such statements in fact prohibit brahmin women from ascending</p>
<p>[[298]]</p>
<p>a separate pyre (pṛthakcityārohaṇaparatvāt; Sdhp.45r.2-3). The implication here is that the chief or brahmin wife, the patnī, should join her husband on his pyre (anvārohana) while the junior wives of lower varna should burn on separate ones (anumaraṇa). As the quotation from Usanas explains, a brahmin woman should not go (i.e. die) by ascending (samāruhya) a separate pyre, but for other women this is the ancient duty for wives.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup></p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s conclusion is obvious. The religious duty (or practice) of dying with one&rsquo;s husband is commended (prasastaḥ) for women,&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup> whether brahmins or not, whether good or bad.</p>
<p>The religious duties of the widow (vidhavādharmāḥ; Sdhp.45r. 5-48v.6)</p>
<p>Judging by his previous section, Tryambaka believes that the best course of action open to the widow is that of dying with her husband. The way in which he opens this section reinforces that view.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If for some reason, by some stroke of fate (daivayogāt), she does not follow her husband (anuyāti), then her virtue (śīlam) must be protected; for if her virtue is lost, she falls down (to hell).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup> More important perhaps, her loss of virtue (silam) causes her husband to fall from heaven (svargāt patiḥ patati; i.e. into hell), and her parents and brothers too (Sdhp.45r.7-8; Aśv. in the Pārijāta). The &lsquo;stroke of fate&rsquo; implies that the wife in question is pregnant, menstruating or caring for a small infant when her husband dies (see Par.M.II.i.p.58-9; Sm.M.I.p.162; Sahā.I.8,etc.; cf.PVK II.i.p.633). Of these, the menstruating woman may burn herself after her ritual bath on the fourth day (cf. pp.286-7).</p>
<p>Tryambaka then describes the conduct that will ensure that the</p>
<p>[[299]]</p>
<p>widow&rsquo;s virtue is safe. For the rest of her days, she should live the subdued and restricted life of the celibate student (kṣāntā niyatā brahmacārinī; Sdhp.45r.9, Manu ‹ Manu V.158) as opposed to the life of the married woman with all its outward signs of happiness and ornamentation (cf. section IIA, pp.88-101). She should willingly mortify her body (kamam tu kṣaped deham), living on flowers, roots and fruits (Sdhp.45v.10, Manu Manu V.157); or, alternatively, on fruits, vegetables and barley (Sdhp.45v.3, Asv.). She should eat only once a day, and in addition she should perform regular severe fasts (Sdhp.45r.1-3, Āśv. ‹ Sm.M.I.p.160, etc.). She should wear undyed (vṛktam) garments, no bodice (kañcukam), no perfumes (gandhadravya) or unguents (udvartanam; Sdhp.46r. 6-8, Aśv.; cf. section IIA, pp.88-101). If she binds her hair on top of her head (kabarībandha), she causes her husband to be bound in the other world (bhartṛbandhāya jāyate, Sdhp.46r.5, Aśv.; cf. section IIA, pp.96-101). She should sleep on the ground (bhūśayanam kāryam), never on a &lsquo;high bed&rsquo; (paryanka; Sdhp.45v.4-5, Āśv. &lt; Sm.M.I.p.160, etc.; cf. section IID, pp.236-45). She should not even mention the name of another man (Sdhp.45v.10–11, Manu (Manu V.157), nor have any sort of contact with him (Tryambaka&rsquo;s gloss; Sdhp.45v.11-46r.1).</p>
<p>In fact, her lifestyle is repeatedly compared with that of the ascetic or Vedic student (for similar associations in south India today, see Fuller and Logan 1985:89ff.). For example, &rsquo;the ascetic (or renouncer; yati), the celibate student (brahmacāri) and the widow should avoid (chewing) betel (cf. sections IIA, pp.96-101, and IIC, pp.229-33, anointing (their bodies with oils or unguents; cf. section IIA, pp.96-101), and eating off copper or brass vessels (cf. section IIC, pp.217-21; Yatidh.57.79-92; Olivelle 1977:37, 168).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:55"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup> In other examples, the parallel is made by specifically calling the widow&rsquo;s way of life (vidhavāvrata) &lsquo;renunciation&rsquo; (e.g. pravrajyā; see above, note 60) or, in the widest sense, &rsquo;the celibate life&rsquo; (e.g. brahmacāriṇī, Sdhp.45r.9, Manu ‹ Manu V.158; brahmacaryam, Sdhp.46r.4, Āp.; etc.). But the widow may never leave</p>
<p>[[300]]</p>
<p>home as a true renunciate. Tryambaka explains. &lsquo;Forsaking sons, brothers and other (male relatives) after her husband (dies), and living independently, incurs condemnation.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:56"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup> For a woman may never act independently (see above, p.276, note 9); as a widow, her dependence is simply transferred from husband to sons. Indeed, &rsquo;the woman (i.e. widow) who is (truly) devoted to her husband should not do anything without (first) asking her sons.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:57"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup></p>
<p>Devotion to one&rsquo;s husband, even after his death, thus remains the key point of the widow&rsquo;s life. If she has no son (putrābhāve; Tryambaka&rsquo;s gloss), she should make funeral offerings (tarpanam kāryam) to her husband daily, and to his father and grandfather (Sdhp. 45v.5-6, Āśv.). &lsquo;She may worship Visnu (but only) if she thinks (all the time) of her husband, not otherwise. She should meditate on her husband alone, always; that is, (on her husband) in the auspicious guise of (the god) Visnu. &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:58"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup> &lsquo;For she (i.e. the widow) who takes refuge in the religious duty of the virtuous wife (satidharmam) should always worship her husband, bringing him to mind by means of a portrait or a clay model. &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:59"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Tryambaka makes no mention of or allowance for the remarriage of widows. However, he does raise the question of niyoga, a practice much discussed in commentarial and digest writing. The point at issue is whether or not the widow of a man who dies without a son may, after her husband&rsquo;s death, have sexual intercourse with another man appointed&rsquo; (niyukta) to produce that son for him. The problem is caused once again by a conflict of rulings. On the one hand, a widow should not even mention the name of another man (see above), let alone have intercourse with</p>
<p>[[301]]</p>
<p>him. On the other hand, a woman is at fault if she does not bear a</p>
<p>son;</p>
<p>and a man without a son is barred from heaven. Tryambaka presents the purvapakṣa argument in favour of niyoga first. A blanket prohibition on sexual intercourse with a man other than one&rsquo;s husband is inappropriate (anupapannam) ‘because even though blame is attached to sexual intercourse with another man for the sake of pleasure, it is necessary for the purpose of (producing) a son. &lsquo;<sup id="fnref:60"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup> The evidence for this is derived from the story of Jaratkaru in the Mahābhārata. Threatened with the extinction of their line (samtanaprakṣayāt), and the dire consequence that they will all fall into hell, Jaratkaru&rsquo;s ancestors entreat him to produce a son (Sdhp.47[1]r.2-3; cf. Mbh.I.13.9-34). For &rsquo;there is no heaven for one who has no son.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:61"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup></p>
<p>The next step in the argument in favour of niyoga is the ruling that &lsquo;in the absence of a natural (aurasa) son, it is necessary that a kṣetraja son should be acquired.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:62"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">62</a></sup> In this context, the &lsquo;field&rsquo; (kṣetra) is the wife and the &lsquo;owner of the field&rsquo; (kṣetrin) is her husband. The son &lsquo;born of his field&rsquo; (kṣetraja) is the son born to a man&rsquo;s wife by another man on his behalf; whether the husband in question is dead or incapacitated (e.g. by impotence, disease or a curse). The sower or &lsquo;owner of the seed&rsquo; (bījin) is the man &lsquo;appointed&rsquo; (niyogin) for this task. For the traditional list of the kinds of sons deemed acceptable for the two crucial purposes of making śrāddha offerings to the ancestors (pindadāne) and dividing the inheritance (amsagrahane), Tryambaka quotes at length from Yajnavalkya (Sdhp.47[1]r.5.5–9‹ Yājñ.II.128-32). According to this quotation, the kṣetraja comes third in order of importance; that is, after the son born to a man by his own wife (i.e. married according to the proper religious ritual; auraso dharmapatnījaḥ), and the son of a putrikā daughter (putrikāsutaḥ, Sdhp.47[1]r.5-6; for a discussion of the putrikā, see section IIB, pp.146-7). Tryambaka draws further evidence from the story of Parasurama in the Mahābhārata. When Parasurama killed all the male kṣatriyas, their widows asked brahmins to produce sons with them on behalf of their dead hus-</p>
<p>[[302]]</p>
<p>bands (Sdhp.47[1]r.9-13 Mbh.1.98.3b-5). Finally, Tryambaka cites the well-known examples of Kuntī, Ambikā, Ambālikā and so on, all of whom had sons by the practice of niyoga (Sdhp.47[1]r. 13-14; cf. section V, pp.309-10).</p>
<p>According to Tryambaka, however, the purvapakṣa position is untenable. Only two kinds of son are acceptable in the kali age: the aurasa and the adopted son (dattaka, datta; Sdhp.47[1]r.14-47[1] v.2). This in turn raises the question of whether, if a man dies without a son, his widow may adopt on his behalf. According to Tryambaka, she may, but only if her husband gives his consent to adoption before he dies (Sdhp.47[1]v.2-5).,For, according to Baudhāyana, ‘a woman may not give or take a son except with the consent of her husband.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:63"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">63</a></sup> If he dies without giving his consent, she may not adopt; but neither may she resort to the practice of niyoga. Instead, she must devote herself totally to the celibate life already described (brahmacaryavrata, vidhavāvrata). Tryambaka quotes Manu. &lsquo;Many thous ands of men who have remained celibate (brahmacārīṇām) from their boyhood, and who are (therefore) without sons, have (nonetheless) gone to heaven without (first) continuing their family line. (Similarly,) when her husband dies, the virtuous woman (sādhvī stri) who has taken up the celibate life (brahmacaryavrate) goes to heaven even if she has no son, just like those male celibates (brahmacāriṇaḥ).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:64"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">64</a></sup></p>
<p>In section V, however, the question of niyoga is approached from another angle altogether, and with the opposite conclusion: if a man wants his wife to practise niyoga then what is strictly speaking wrong becomes right (see section V, pp.309-10).</p>
<p>Tryambaka also discusses the interesting question of the im-</p>
<p>[[303]]</p>
<p>purity and inauspiciousness traditionally ascribed to widows. The examples he quotes are typical. &lsquo;Just as the body, bereft of life, in that moment becomes impure, so the woman bereft of her husband is always impure, even if she has bathed properly. Of all inauspicious things, the widow is the most inauspicious; there can never be any success after seeing a widow (cf. section IIA, pp.54-7). The wise man should avoid even her blessing (tadāsiṣam api)—excepting only that of his mother-for it is devoid of all auspiciousness, like the poison of a snake (āsīviṣopamām).&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:65"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">65</a></sup></p>
<p>According to Tryambaka, however, such remarks apply only to the widow who does not behave as she ought (ācārahīnāviṣayam; Sdhp.47[2]r.4-5). For even if she becomes a widow, the pativratā &lsquo;who is devoted to (good) conduct&rsquo; (caryāparā), ‘fully committed to her religious duty&rsquo; (dharmasamayukta), and &lsquo;who follows (the proper path of) widowhood (vaidhavyam palayet) — earns a threefold reward: she is both happy and auspicious (subha) in this life; she obtains the pleasures of heaven (svargabhogan), or indeed the same heaven as her husband (patilokam); and she marries that same husband again in her next life (Sdhp.47[2]r.5-7). Theoretically at least, if she behaves as she should (see above), the dread inauspiciousness with which the scriptures threaten her are cancelled out. But if she cannot do this, she would presumably be well-advised to die with her husband.</p>
<p>Tryambaka finally raises the question of whether or not the widow should shave her head. In south India today, widows are in fact traditionally tonsured after the funeral (cf. Fuller and Logan 1985:95) but this is a late development calculated to bring the widow in line with other &lsquo;renouncers&rsquo; (cf. Yatidh.21.39,104-5; Olivelle 1977:38,104-6). Tryambaka argues that &lsquo;(rulings that prescribe) shaving the head (śiraso vapanam) apply to brahmin women; (those prescribing) keeping the hair (long apply) to women of other castes.&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:66"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">66</a></sup> The quotation is taken from the Mahābhārata where</p>
<p>[[304]]</p>
<p>Dhṛtarastra&rsquo;s widowed daughters-in-law (i.e. kṣatriya women) are described as having dishevelled hair (asimantasiroruhā[h], lit. &lsquo;without a parting&rsquo;; Sdhp.47[2]r.8-10 &lt; Mbh.XV.32.15).</p>
<p>In contexts other than widowhood (e.g. for certain prāyaścitta rituals when performed by unmarried girls or women whose husbands are alive), the phrase &lsquo;shaving the head&rsquo; (siraso mundanam) is taken to mean simply cutting two fingers&rsquo; breadth (angulidvayam) off the ends of the hair (Sdhp.47[2]v. 1-3; cf. Bhardwaj 1983:154). In fact, as Tryambaka explains, the four main prohibitions relating to the performance by women of certain aspects (or component elements; anga) of vratas include a prohibition on shaving the head (kesavapanam). The other three concern sleeping or staying far from home (dūre śayanāsanam); staying in the cow-pen at night, or following cows about in dangerous places during the day; and wearing deerskins (ajinam vās[ah]; Sdhp.47[2]v.6–8).</p>
<p>Tryambaka concludes that three kinds of women merit the name of pativratā: the wife who dies before her husband (bhartuḥ pūrvam mṛtā) and patiently waits for him to join her; the wife who follows her husband onto the funeral pyre (bhartrā sahānugatā), exemplified by Madri; and the wife who after her husband&rsquo;s death lives an ascetic and celibate life for the rest of her days (vāvajjīvam brahmacaryādinā yuktā), exemplified by Kunti. The first kind of wife is the auspicious ideal. But if the husband dies first, inauspiciousness and misfortune may be offset by either of the two options open to his widow. While the second alternative is deemed safer than the third -given the nature of women and the difficulties of leading a truly ascetic life—all three earn the ultimate reward of reaching the same heaven as their husbands (patisālokyam; Sdhp.48r.9-48v.6).</p>

<p>This important ruling was quoted in a recent judgement of the Indian Supreme Court hailed by the media as &lsquo;an unequivocal victory&rsquo; for women&rsquo;s rights and a major break-through in dowry disputes&rsquo;. Sunil Sethi&rsquo;s article, published in India Today in April 1985, opens with the following. ‘For some time now the Supreme Court has acquired a healthy reputation for passing judgements heavily weighted in favour of women&rsquo;s rights. Last fortnight that reputation was amply reinforced when the court passed a landmark judgement declaring that all gifts made over to a woman at the time of her marriage remained her absolute private property till the end; and that her husband, or any other, had no right to them without her sanction&hellip;. But the Supreme Court, in fact, was upholding the right of a woman to retain nuptial gifts as enshrined in the ancient concept of stridhan (woman&rsquo;s wealth) first mooted by the Vedic sage Manu. Quoting from classical treatises on Hindu law, the 25-page judgement&hellip; noted that &ldquo;neither the husband, nor the son, nor the father, nor the brother, has power to use or to aliene the legal property of a woman. And if any of them shall consume such property against her own consent he shall be compelled to pay its value with interest to her&hellip;&rdquo;. &hellip; In other words, gifts of cash, ornaments, silver, clothing or anything that constitutes dowry-may be entrusted by the wife to the husband to keep but he would be deemed &ldquo;guilty of criminal breach of trust&rdquo; if he either misappropriates or refuses to return what the court regards “as the absolute and personal property of his wife&quot;.
