(Sdhp. 7v.9-10v.1)
Serving the sacred fire (agniśuśrūṣā; Sdhp. 7v.9-10r.6)
The word suśruṣā is well chosen. In this context, it is a general term denoting the practical aspects of the fire sacrifice. It thus covers both the śrauta and grhya rituals detailed below. Secondly, it carries with it all the associations of religious service and devotion. For example, the brahmin who chooses to be a perpetual student is instructed to ‘serve’ his teacher diligently all his life (paricaret, Manu II.243; glossed by Sarv. as suśruṣet). If his teacher dies, then he should ‘serve’ his teacher’s son, his widow or sapinda relation (Manu II.247; guruvac chuśrūṣām anutiṣṭhet, Kull.). If none of these are alive, he should spend the rest of his life ‘serving’ the sacred fire (agniśuśruṣā; Manu II.248). Thirdly, the term reinforces the associations of obedience, subservience and attentiveness suggested by bhartṛ- śuśrūṣā (‘serving one’s husband’), already established as the single most important goal for women (see Tryambaka’s introduction, section I, pp. 29–43). These ideas are further explained in Tryambaka’s detailed definition of the term in his conclusion (section V, especially pp. 312–13).">

  <p>IIB At Dawn</p>
<p>(Sdhp. 7v.9-10v.1)</p>
<p>Serving the sacred fire (agniśuśrūṣā; Sdhp. 7v.9-10r.6)</p>
<p>The word suśruṣā is well chosen. In this context, it is a general term denoting the practical aspects of the fire sacrifice. It thus covers both the śrauta and grhya rituals detailed below. Secondly, it carries with it all the associations of religious service and devotion. For example, the brahmin who chooses to be a perpetual student is instructed to &lsquo;serve&rsquo; his teacher diligently all his life (paricaret, Manu II.243; glossed by Sarv. as suśruṣet). If his teacher dies, then he should &lsquo;serve&rsquo; his teacher&rsquo;s son, his widow or sapinda relation (Manu II.247; guruvac chuśrūṣām anutiṣṭhet, Kull.). If none of these are alive, he should spend the rest of his life &lsquo;serving&rsquo; the sacred fire (agniśuśruṣā; Manu II.248). Thirdly, the term reinforces the associations of obedience, subservience and attentiveness suggested by bhartṛ- śuśrūṣā (&lsquo;serving one&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;), already established as the single most important goal for women (see Tryambaka&rsquo;s introduction, section I, pp. 29–43). These ideas are further explained in Tryambaka&rsquo;s detailed definition of the term in his conclusion (section V, especially pp. 312–13).</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the term agnihotra denotes the Vedic ritual of fire sacrifice described in detail in the śrautasūtras (see Dumont 1939). It involves three fires (treta; i.e. the āhavanīya, gārhapatya and dakṣināgni), takes place in a special enclosure, and consists primarily of an oblation (homa) of cow&rsquo;s milk into the āhavanīya fire twice daily, at sunset and at dawn. Only those who have reached a certain age (&lsquo;when he has a son and his hair is still black&rsquo;,</p>
<p>Sab. on Jai.1.3.3; but cf. Trik. 1.78c-9b) and who are rich enough to pay for the priests, may set up the three srauta fires. Once a man has done so, he is required to perform the twice-daily sacrifice for the rest of his life as a householder. The morning and evening oblations are in fact two halves of one ritual. In essence, this is a magical rite to ensure the continued passage of the sun through the heavens (&lsquo;un charme solaire&rsquo;, Dumont 1939:viii). The evening performance is thus of particular importance since it marks the sun&rsquo;s disappearance and determines its return the following day. The apparent emphasis on the morning oblation is probably due to the fact that the discussion of the proper time for the ritual traditionally revolves around</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[103]]</p>
<p>that morning performance (Bodewitz 1976:3). In fact, the correct time of the oblation varies (depending on the text) from just before to just after sandhyā (‘juncture&rsquo;, i.e. sunset or sunrise; e.g. Āp.śr. VI.4. 7-9; Katy.śr.IV.14.6, IV.15.1,12-15). The first oblation in the morning is offered to Surya; the first in the evening to Agni; the second in both cases to Prajā pati.</p>
<p>The term sayamprātarhoma denotes the simpler grhya counterpart of the śrauta ritual, as described in the grhyasutras and later smṛtis. It involves the single domestic fire (gṛhyāgni; also called aupāsana, vaivāhika, smārta, etc.); and consists of an oblation (homa) of cooked food such as boiled rice or barley (Aśv.gr.1.2.1; Āp.gr.III. 7.19; Gobh.Sm.I.131, III.114). Like its srauta equivalent, it is offered in two parts, evening and morning (hence sayampratarhoma), with similar differences of opinion as to the precise time. The single or aupāsana fire is established by every ritually independent male, whether this independence is marked by the end of his studentship (for one who does not return to the joint family), his marriage (if that does not immediately follow the former), the death of his father (in the case of the eldest son) or the partition of the joint family (for younger sons; Sankh.gr.I.1.2-5; Gobh.gr.I.1.7.12; Mān.gr.II.1.1). A particular age or degree of wealth is not stipulated. Thus if a man is unable for reasons of time or money to perform the more complex and costly śrauta ritual of agnihotra, he should perform the simpler aupāsana ritual. If he has the choice, he should choose the former (Sm.C.II.p.412-13). According to some texts, he might even do both, in which case there arises the problem of which should be performed first (e.g. Katy.śr.IV.13.12 and comm.). According to the Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana, there are two views on the kindling of the śrauta fires: that it is obligatory (nitya), and that it need only be done in order to obtain certain desires (kāmya, Trik.1.6); the latter view is ascribed to Baudhāyana (Trik.I.7). Failure to perform either ritual, out of unbelief or idleness, takes one to a variety of hells (Sm.C.II.p.417). The deities to whom the oblations are offered in the sayamprātarhoma are the same as those in the śrauta agnihotra: Surya, Agni and Prajapati.</p>
<p>Is Tryambaka concerned with the srauta or the gṛhya ritual, or with both? To answer this question, I shall consider one of his rulings out of sequence. Sdhp.8r.5-6 informs us that, according to Manu, &rsquo;the (householder&rsquo;s) wife should perform (these) three rituals daily: service (suśrūṣā) relating to the agnihotra ritual; samdhyā or twilight</p>
<p>[[104]]</p>
<p>worship; and the obligatory bali offerings.&lsquo;1 Does this reference to the agnihotra indicate an exclusive interest in srauta ritual, or is it being used more loosely here to cover both forms of the fire sacrifice?</p>
<p>Tryambaka certainly begins with rulings that only make sense in the context of the śrauta ritual. In Sdhp.8r.1-4, for example, he describes the layout of the traditional agnihotra enclosure (see below, p. 120, notes 11, 12). In Sdhp.8v.9, he explains that the wife should take her place after the uddharaṇam; that is, after coals have been taken from the garhapatya fire to light the other srauta fires (see p.130, note 25 below). In Sdhp. 9v.3-5, however, he informs us that the ruling just given on the close link between the wife and the sacred fires of the agnihotra ritual is equally applicable to the aupāsana ritual (see p. 140, note 40). He thus seems to differentiate between the śrauta and smārta fire sacrifice, and to cover both.</p>
<p>In fact, the obvious parallels between śrauta and smārta fire rituals have created a confusing overlap in terms and concepts (cf. Bodewitz 1976:191 ff.). Ap.1.4.14.1, for example, gives agnihotra first in the list of ritual obligations to be fulfilled by the newlymarried man (cf. also Āp.I.4.13.22). In this context, the term must mean the morning and evening offerings into the grhya fire (sāyamprātarhoma). For, as indicated above, the śrauta ritual is open only to those who have reached a certain age and position; it is certainly not an automatic requirement of the householder (but cf. Trik.I.78c9b). The establishment of the grhya fire, on the other hand, often coincides with the marriage ceremony. The aupāsana fire ritual is presumably called agnihotra merely to give it the higher ritual status. For the same reason, Hir.gr.I.26.3 declares that the man who makes offerings in the grhya fire is held to be an āhitāgni (i.e. one who has set up the three srauta fires). (Mātṛdatta omits this chapter in his commentary, which suggests that it is in fact a later addition.)</p>
<p>It is therefore unwise to assume that Tryambaka&rsquo;s references to the agnihotra always indicate the śrauta ritual. As we shall see, some of them most certainly do. But his stress on the importance of fire worship, without any provisos regarding the age, wealth and</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[105]]</p>
<p>so on of the householder concerned, suggests that Tryambaka&rsquo;s main interest is in the ritual responsibilities of the wife of the independent householder and not merely with those of the wife of the āhitāgni. Tryambaka professes to have written a treatise on the religious duties of Hindu women. The text itself reveals that his interest is limited to orthodox women of the three higher varnas, in particular to those at court. A further restriction to the wives of āhitāgnis is unlikely.</p>
<p>The term samdhya means literally the &lsquo;juncture&rsquo; between night and day, thus the twilight periods of dawn and dusk; a third ‘juncture&rsquo; is that between morning and afternoon, hence midday. In the context of ritual, the term denotes the religious acts performed by twice-born men at these two (e.g. Gaut.I.2.16–17; Manu II.101; Yājñ.I.24-5) or three (e.g. Apar.p.49; Sm. C.II.p.354; Vidyārṇava 1979:32) junctures of the day, hence the &rsquo;twilight ritual&rsquo; or &lsquo;prayer&rsquo; (samdhyopāsanam, samdhyāvandanam). As already shown, samdhyopāsanam is one of the three ritual responsibilities Tryambaka stipulates for the orthodox Hindu wife (see note 1). But precisely what does he mean by this?</p>
<p>First, what is normally meant by samdhyopāsanam? The principal component is the repeated recitation (japa) of mantras, primarily the gayatri preceded by om and the three vyāhṛtis. Subsidiary components include sipping (acamana); ritual breathing (prānā- yāma; lit. ‘restraint of the breath&rsquo;); sprinkling with water (mārjana); a ritual to drive out sin (aghamarṣaṇa; i.e. removing the sin of the preceding night or day; cf. Manu II. 102); offering water to the sun (arghyadāna); and the worship of Surya in the morning or Varuna in the evening (upasthāna). Each of these also involves the recitation of Vedic mantras (PVK II.i.p.314-19; Vidyarṇava 1979:32-41). The proper setting for the ritual is outside the village (Āp.I.11.30.8; Gaut.II.16; aranye, Śankh.gṛ.II.9.1); in particular, by a river, in the shade of an aśvattha tree, or in a similar sacred place (Baudh.gr.II.4.2). Only the agnihotrin who must perform the śrauta ritual at sunrise in his house may perform the samdhyā at home (Ujj. on Ap.I.11.30.9). The morning ritual is performed standing, the evening one sitting (Gaut.II.17; Sm.C.II.p.352-3).</p>
<p>The parallels with both the śrauta ritual of agnihotra and the smārta ritual of sāyamprātarhoma are obvious. All three rituals are performed morning and evening (the midday samdhyā is often omitted); all three involve an offering to Surya and invocations to</p>
<p>[[106]]</p>
<p>both fire and the sun; all three are in origin magical rites to ensure the continued rising and setting of the sun. The aghamarṣaṇa ritual to remove sin recalls a similar interpretation of the agnihotra (see Bodewitz 1976: 153 ff.). So close are these parallels, and so prevalent the current custom of twilight worship, that Gonda maintains that the modern ritual of samdhyopāsanam has not only borrowed from the Vedic ritual of agnihotra but has replaced it (1970:74). Certainly, the adoration of the sun is an important part of the śrauta ritual. Gonda&rsquo;s remark is even more persuasive if the term samdhyā is taken to denote not merely the twilight prayers but the full morning or evening ritual (agnihotrahoma or sāyamprātarhoma) that normally follows them (see below). In this context, it is interesting to note that when the Smṛtimuktāphala quotes the sloka given above concerning the three ritual responsibilities of the orthodox wife (see note 1), the term samdhyopāsanam is glossed as sāyamprātarhoma, the grhya counterpart of the agnihotra (Sm.M.II. p. 355). We may conclude that there is a further confusing overlap of terms.</p>
<p>Secondly, what is the proper time for the performance of the ritual? This question is approached in two ways: in relation to the actual time of sunset or sunrise (thus creating a further parallel to the discussions of agnihotra and sayamprātarhoma); and in relation to the morning fire sacrifice (thus clearly differentiating between homa and samdhyā). For example, the morning samdhyā ideally begins before sunrise and continues until the sun appears; the evening samdhya begins as the sun sets and continues until the stars appear (Aśv.gr.III.7.3-6; Har. on Gaut.I.2.17; Sm.C.II. p. 352-3). While Vidyarṇava specifies an exact time of forty-eight minutes for each ritual (1979:32), according to Manu the longer the time spent the better since it brings long life, fame and so forth (Manu IV.93-4). Alternatively, it should be performed after one&rsquo;s morning ablutions (Yajñ.I.98) and before the homa offering (Dakṣa II.28.2; Sm.C.II.p.422).2 In the case of the man who performs both the śrauta and the smārta ritual of homa, the samdhyā ritual should be performed before either of them (Kāty.śr.IV.13.12 and comm.).</p>
<p>Now it is obvious that a lengthy samdhyā would make it difficult</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[107]]</p>
<p>for the householder to perform the homa ritual at the right time, that is, at dawn. In fact, according to Manu II.15 (cf. also Sm.C.II. p.426), the morning sacrifice (yajñaḥ; glossed as agnihotrahomaḥ) may take place either before or after sunrise (udite &rsquo;nudite caiva) or somewhere in between the two (samayadhyuṣite; glossed by Medhātithi as &lsquo;at dawn&rsquo;; by Kulluka as &lsquo;when neither sun nor stars can be seen&rsquo;). Some authorities insist that the ceremony must be completed before the sun has risen &lsquo;by one hand&rsquo;s length&rsquo; (hastād urdhvam) above the horizon (Gobh.Sm.I.122–3; Sm.C.II.p.426); others allow that it may be performed until the end of the morning period (samgava, see p. 45; cf. Āśv.gr.1.9.5 and comm.; Sm.C.II.p. 426). Either way, the difficulty of trying to perform two rituals at roughly the same time remains. Usually, as reported above, the samdhyā is performed first; sometimes it is performed after the homa ritual.</p>
<p>Tryambaka evidently prefers the latter. After his comments on the morning ablutions (see section IIA, pp.69-88, and the clothes and ornaments a woman should wear (see pp.88-101), he moves straight on to deal with the morning fire ritual (agniśuśruṣā). Only when he has done that, does he give a series of rulings on arghyadānam, one of the subsidiary components of the samdhyā ritual (see below, pp. 149–55).</p>
<p>The role of the wife</p>
<p>Before continuing with Tryambaka&rsquo;s discussion of the fire sacrifice, I shall take another of his rulings out of sequence. It concerns his definition of agniśuśrūṣā in relation to women. What exactly is the wife permitted or expected to do? &lsquo;At the time of the oblation,&rsquo; Tryambaka explains, &rsquo;the wife should serve the sacred fire in the sense that she should do such things as adorning (the hearth).&lsquo;3 By this, he presumably means such things as cleaning the area and decorating it with powder designs, flowers and so forth. It is remarkable that this is virtually all Tryambaka tells us about what the wife is actually required to do.</p>
<p>In my comment on Tryambaka&rsquo;s introduction (see section I), I touched briefly on the issue of a woman&rsquo;s right to offer sacrifice. The exclusion of women from Vedic education and upanayana,</p>
<p>[[108]]</p>
<p>combined with the growing tendency to deny the modification (ūha) of gender, led to an almost unanimous rejection of that right. According to Manu, for example, the sacrifice performed by a woman is displeasing to the gods and inauspicious for men; a brahmin may not eat the food offered there (Manu IV. 205–6). It is argued (e.g. in Manu XI.37) that the person who performs the sacrifice must be skilled in srauta ritual (vaitānakuśalaḥ; glossed by Rāgh. as srautakarmakusalah) and thoroughly versed in the Veda (vedapāragah). It follows that if a girl (kanyā) or a young woman whether married or not (yuvatih; glossed by Kull. as anūḍhā ūḍhāpi taruṇī) performs the agnihotra sacrifice, she will go to hell; as indeed will an insufficiently educated or uninitiated or foolish man (Manu XI.36-7; cf. Sm.C.II.p.424; yet cf. pp.141-9 below). In V.155, Manu goes further still: no sacrifice (yajña), no ritual observance (vrata), and no fast (upoṣaṇa) may be performed by a woman separately (prthak; glossed by Sarv. as bhartrā vinā; i.e. independently of her husband). Vis.Sm.XXV.15-16 adds that a woman who observes such a fast or vrata during her husband&rsquo;s lifetime will deprive him of long life and will herself go to hell.</p>
<p>It is evident from such examples that the main thrust of orthodox opposition is ranged against the independent religieuse (see Leslie 1980:27 ff.; 1983(1): 100). It is not necessarily intended to prevent the orthodox high-caste wife from taking her legitimate part in religious ritual jointly with her husband. In fact, as Jaimini declares, husband and wife are jointly entitled to perform the sacrifice and so should do it together (ekakarmyam; Jai.VI.1.17). But what exactly is the wife&rsquo;s role in such ritual acts? If we examine the rulings on precisely this issue of the joint ritual duties of husband and wife, we find that here too the role of the wife is gradually whittled away.</p>
<p>R.V.VIII.31.5, for example, is quite explicit. Husband and wife are joint sacrificers. Together they press out the soma juice (sunutaḥ; glossed as somābhiṣavam kurutaḥ, v.5); together they approach the sacrificial grass (barhih; glossed as yajñam, v.6); together they invite the gods to the sacrificial feast in order to attain immortality (amṛ- tāya; glossed as amaraṇāya samtānābhivṛddhaye, v.9). Sāyaṇa comments that this is a hymn of praise to the married couple performing a sacrifice (vajane dampatyoḥ; or, in the phrase of some MSS, yajamānadampatyoh). He glosses dampatī as &rsquo;the two performers of sacrifice, that is, husband and wife&rsquo; (yajñakāriṇau jāyāpatī). The Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa intones: may husband and wife become one through their joint good deeds (sam patnī patyā sukṛtena</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[109]]</p>
<p>gacchatām); may they, yoked like oxen, bear together the burden of the sacrifice (yajñasya dhuryāyuktāvibhūtām); may they jointly destroy their enemies; and share the rewards in heaven (Tait.Br. III.7.5.11; Śab. on Jai.VI.1.2.).</p>
<p>According to Ap.II.5.11.17, a man needs a wife for two reasons: to bear him children and to perform the religious rituals that must be performed jointly with a wife (prajāsahatvakarmabhyah). A wife who takes part in the kindling of the agnihotra fire with her husband becomes permanently associated with the rituals connected with it (karmabhiḥ sambadhyate; v.14). It is for this reason that, as long as she performs her part in the joint sacrifice and bears children (dharmaprajāsampanne dāre), her husband may not take a second wife (v.12; according to the Ujjvalā, this means she must bear sons). Moreover, a wife who fulfils her religious obligations (dharmasampattih) is one who is both conscientious about and capable of (śraddha saktiś ca) the required śrauta and smārta rituals (śrauteṣu gārhyeṣu smārtesu ca karmasu; Ujj. on v.12).</p>
<p>By playing her part, the wife obtains an equal share in the rewards of the sacrifice. Thus, in the Buddhacarita, when the Buddhato-be abandons his orthodox Hindu wife, she laments that he is depriving her of her legitimate share in the merit obtained by joint sacrifice. She maintains that he has no right to pursue a religious path, either in the home or in the forest, without her (VIII.61–2). For the married couple (dampatī) is initiated together (dīkṣitāv ubhau; i.e. in the kindling of the sacred fire); purified together by the performance of Vedic rituals (vedavidhānasamskṛtau); and therefore destined to enjoy the same rewards after death (samam bubhukṣū parato &lsquo;pi tatphalam; VIII.63).</p>
<p>Even Manu, whose extremist pronouncements on women are well known, insists that the wife is ordained to take part in joint religious rituals. According to Manu IX.28, for example, a man relies on his wife for five essential things: children, religious rituals (dharmakāryāṇi; glossed by Ragh. as balyagnihotrādīni, ‘the bali offering, the fire sacrifice, and so on&rsquo;), obedient service (śuśrūṣā), sexual pleasure, and (the reward of) heaven for both himself and his ancestors. Manu IX. 96 explains that, since women were created to have children (prajanārtham; glossed alternatively as &lsquo;conception&rsquo;, &lsquo;pregnancy&rsquo; or ‘childbirth&rsquo;) and men to continue their line (samtānārtham; glossed as &lsquo;impregnating&rsquo; and &lsquo;implanting the seed&rsquo;), the religious duties applicable to all (sādhārano dharmaḥ) should be performed jointly by husband and wife. Medhātithi comments that</p>
<p>[[110]]</p>
<p>a man has no authority to act alone (ataḥ kevalasyādhikārābhāvāt); hence even wives who deserve to be hated (dveṣyah) should not be abandoned (i.e. superseded).</p>
<p>Similar sentiments abound in the epics and purāṇas. The wife is frequently referred to as &lsquo;one who shares in her husband&rsquo;s religious duties&rsquo; (sahadharmacarī; e.g. Mbh. XIII.134.7a; Ram.II.117.30b; etc.). Sītā is portrayed performing a number of rituals jointly with Rāma before his installation as heir presumptive (Ram.II.5-6). She even takes part in Dasaratha&rsquo;s śraddha ceremony together with Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa (Rām.II.103). The Mārkandeyapurāna concludes that a man cannot fulfil his religious duties to gods, ancestors and guests without a wife: for the wife shares the sacrifice, bears the children and prepares the food (21.70–2).</p>
<p>According to Pāṇini, this participation in the sacrifice is indicated in the word patnī. For the feminine form of pati (‘owner&rsquo;, ‘lord&rsquo;, &lsquo;husband&rsquo;) is simply patī. When the final i of patī is replaced by n before the feminine suffix ī, it denotes a wife &lsquo;related through sacrifice&rsquo; (vajñasamyoge), thus one who takes part in the sacrifices of her husband (Pāṇ.IV.1.33). Since the sudra is not entitled to perform sacrifices, his wife may not be called patnī, or is called so only by analogy (upamānāt siddham; Pat. on Pan.IV.1.33). When Jaimini declares that the patni is entitled to perform sacrifices because she is &lsquo;closely connected with wealth&rsquo; (arthena ca samavetatvat; Jai. VI.1.14), he is taking the term in this most literal sense of &lsquo;female owner&rsquo;. As the chief wife of equal caste, the patnī is the joint owner of wealth and thus meets the stipulations required of the performer of sacrifice (cf. Jai.VI.1.10; see section I). Since the wealth required for the sacrifice is in fact common to both husband and wife, they should perform the sacrifice together (Jai.VI.1.17).</p>
<p>The purvamīmāmsā material is illuminating in many respects. For example, in his commentary on Jai.VI.1.17, Śabara explains that certain important rituals such as the darśapūrṇamāsa (new and full moon ceremonies) and the jyotistoma (a class of soma ritual) would be ineffective if either the wife or the husband did not participate. In the cases he cites, both sacrificer and patnī must gaze at the ghee.4 But how active, and how important, is the latter&rsquo;s participation in other rituals?</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[111]]</p>
<p>Certainly, in several Vedic rites, the wife plays both an active and an essential role. In the horse-sacrifice (aśvamedha), for example, four (or three) of the king&rsquo;s wives (mahiṣi, the consecrated queen; vāvātā, the favourite; parivṛktī, the neglected one who has borne no son; and pālāgalī, the low-born wife) anoint the horse and weave pearls into its mane and tail (Śat.Br.XIII.2.6.4-8; Katy.śr.XX. 5.15-17; Dumont 1948:480). When it has been killed (samjñapanam; Katy.śr.XX.6.10), they circumambulate the horse nine times, fanning it as they walk (Katy.śr.XX.6.12-13; Sat.Br.XIII. 2.8.2-4; Dumont 1948:482). In the Rāmāyaṇa, the queen decapitates the animal herself (Rām.I.14.33-5). She then lies beside the horse under the cover of a garment and simulates sexual intercourse with it (āśvasisnam upasthe kurute, Katy.śr.XX.6.16; yonipradese, comm.; Baudh.śr.15.29). After a ritual exchange of abuse, the queens dissect the animal with special needles (Kāty. śr.XX.7.1-2). Similarly, in the ceremony of the king&rsquo;s consecration (rājasūya), three of his wives (mahiṣī, vāvātā and parivṛktī) are among the people of importance to the king to whom the &lsquo;jewelofferings&rsquo; (ratnahavis) are given (Sat.Br.V.3.4,13; Tait.Sam.I.8.9; Heesterman 1957:49–57). In the vājapeya (lit. &lsquo;drink of strength&rsquo;) ritual, the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife (wearing a skirt of kusa grass to counter the effects of her impure lower half) accompanies her husband in a symbolic joint ascent to heaven (Sat.Br.V.2.1.8-11). In the soma sacrifice, she ritually cleanses the animal about to be sacrificed (Śat.Br.III.8.2.1-6); makes the foundation brick for the fire-altar (Sat.Br.VI.5.3.1); and at one time she may even have chanted the sāman verses now sung by the udgātṛ (Sat.Br.XIV.1.35). For the wife is the &lsquo;bottom half&rsquo; (jaghanārdhā, Sat.Br.III.8.2.2; V.2.1.8) of the sacrifice, half the sacrificer&rsquo;s own self (Sat.Br.V.2.1.10). As Sabara comments on Jai.VI.1.18, statements such as &lsquo;he binds the wife with a rope and the sacrificer with a girdle in order to make them a couple&rsquo; (mithunatvāya; Tait.Sam. VI.1.3.5) only make sense if the sacrifice is performed jointly by husband and wife.</p>
<p>In theory then, the patnī is as much a sacrificer as her husband. But, as Śabara also explains, the ritual function of the wife is totally different from that of the male sacrificer: hers is a necessarily supportive role. Her participation therefore does not in any way disturb the &lsquo;singleness&rsquo; (ekatvam) of the sacrificer (Śab. on Jai.VI.1.17). This point is picked up in Jai.VI.1.22 and 23. It seems that some theorists argued that the dual number in the joint sacrifice refers not</p>
<p>[[112]]</p>
<p>to the husband and his wife but to two men (dvayoh pumsor adhikāraḥ, Śab. on Jai.VI.1.22; e.g. the sacrificer and the priest). Jaimini disagrees. The sacrifice is performed by one man not two (ekaḥ pumān ādadhīta na dvau; Śab. on Jai.VI.1.23); the dual number indicates the &lsquo;quality&rsquo; of the single man (guṇasya tu vidhā- natvāt; Jai.VI.1.23); the word &lsquo;second&rsquo; thus denotes the wife (patnya dvitiyaśabdaḥ syat; Jai.VI.1.23). The Vedic &lsquo;sacrificing couple&rsquo; is reduced to a male sacrificer with his female &lsquo;second&rsquo;. It is clear which way the trend is going.5</p>
<p>Having established the essential &lsquo;singleness&rsquo; of the male sacrificer in the joint sacrifice, the next question concerns which acts should be performed by the man alone, and which by his assistant wife. Jai.VI.1.24 explains. Since the wife is not equal (atulyatvāt; i.e. to the husband), she should perform only those acts which are specifically laid down in the Veda for her to do (tasyā yāvad uktam; cf. Śab., vacanaprāmānyāt), such as the invocation of blessings and celibacy (āśīr brahmacaryam). I have already noted that Jaimini does not in fact maintain that women are not entitled to study the Veda (see section I). He merely insists that in the joint sacrifice the wife is &rsquo;not equal&rsquo;. But all later commentators, from Sabara onwards, gloss this vague &lsquo;inequality&rsquo; in terms of Vedic education, or rather the lack of it. The sacrificer is a man and therefore learned in the Veda (yajamānaḥ pumān vidvāmś ca); whereas the wife is a woman and therefore not learned (patnī strī ca avidyā ca;</p>
<p>Sab. on Jai.IV.I.24).</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Sabara does not take exception to the term āsīḥ, &rsquo;the invocation of blessings&rsquo;, that is, Vedic mantras. Kumārila, in his commentary, the Tupṭīkā, does. According to him, the wife, being without Vedic education, would be unable to pronounce the mantras correctly (but cf. section I above). The term āsīḥ must therefore be reinterpreted to mean &rsquo;embellishments&rsquo; (samskārāḥ) such as bathing, anointing, applying collyrium and so on. Even the term brahmacarya (celibacy) must be reinterpreted to mean &lsquo;freedom from all passions&rsquo; (Kum.Ṭu.VI.1.24; Jha 1934:993). Lesser things</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[113]]</p>
<p>laid down for the wife to do, such as gazing at the ghee (e.g. Śab. on Jai.VI.1.17, see above; Ap.śr.II.6.6), may be interpreted literally. Sandal is so influenced by later views on the matter that he translates even Jaimini&rsquo;s reference to āsīḥ as &lsquo;paring of the nails&rsquo;, commenting that the term covers the shaving of the head and face as well. He does add, however, that other commentators have taken āśīh to mean Vedic benedictions (Sandal 1974 on Jai.VI.1.24). Tryambaka, on the other hand, follows Kumārila. But, for him, the transition from Vedic mantras (āsīḥ) to &rsquo;embellishments&rsquo; (samskārāḥ) no longer requires explanation. He merely states that the wife&rsquo;s service to the fire implies ‘adorning and so on&rsquo; (alankārādi).</p>
<p>[[6]]</p>
<p>This issue of the right (adhikara) of the wife to perform sacrifice is discussed at some length in the first kānda or &lsquo;section&rsquo; of the Trikāṇḍamandana, Bhaskara Miśra&rsquo;s exposition of the somayaga aphorisms of Apastamba, also known as the Āpastambasūtradhvanitārthakārikā. Bhaskara Miśra wrote at a time when it was evidently still possible to assert that, according to some, the wife was equally and jointly responsible for the sacrifice (before A.D. 1100 according to PVK.I.i.p.551; in the eleventh or twelfth century A.D. according to Smith, 1984:75-80). Judging by the repeated juxtaposition of unreconciled opposing views, however, this produced an uncomfortable ambivalence.</p>
<p>The section on the adhikara of the wife opens by presenting three distinct views. According to the first, all the specifications (lakṣaṇaḥ) enjoined for the sacrificer, except the traditional learning of the Veda (svādhyāyamātram tyaktva), are applicable to all the sacrificer&rsquo;s wives (Trik.I.43). According to the second, the sacrificer shares these rights regarding the sacrifice only with his chief wife (savarnaya jyeṣṭhabharyayaiva). According to the third, the sacrificer may not share these rights with a wife married solely for pleasure (kāmapatni) after the śrauta fires have been lit (Trik.I.44). Trik.I.45 then declares that the adhikāra of the married couple acting together in the sacrifice (dampatyor ubhayor mithah) is indeed equal (tulya eva). In accordance with this view, even the ability (kartṛtvam) to make sacrificial offerings (dravyatyāge) is equal (Trik.I.46a). (The term tyaga denotes the ritual renunciation of the fruit of the offering by the sacrificer and the assigning of that fruit</p>
<p>[[114]]</p>
<p>to the relevent deity.) In the context of an optional rite (kāmyatve), the ritual should be performed if either husband or wife have a particular desire (Trik.I.53a). According to an alternative view ascribed to Rudradatta (comm. on Trik.I.46b), however, the husband actually makes the offering (tyagam patiḥ kuryāt) while his wife merely ‘approves&rsquo; it (patnī tam anumanyate; glossed as anujānā- ti, &lsquo;she gives her consent&rsquo;); hence their inequality in the sacrifice (adhikāre &lsquo;pi vaiṣamyam; Trik.I.47a). What is meant by the wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;approval&rsquo; or &lsquo;consent&rsquo; is unclear. Following this line of thought, the sacrificer has the entitlement (adhikāravān) with regard to the major offerings (prādhānyena) which are independent (svaniṣṭha; glossed as svatantra); while the wife, being dependent upon her husband (patni tatparatantrā satî) has the entitlement regarding subsidiary offerings (angabhūtādhikāriṇi); hence the religious res ponsibilities of the husband are heavier (patidharmā balādhikāḥ; Trik.I.48). In the context of a kāmya rite, the ritual should be performed only if the husband is the one with the desire (Trik.I.53b). Bhaskara Miśra is evidently unwilling to endorse either of the two prevailing views.</p>
<p>By the time of later commentators, however, all injunctions for the joint sacrifice that are not specifically given in the feminine form are taken to refer only to the male sacrificer, the husband. Even those expressed in the feminine are reinterpreted according to current notions of the religious inequality of women. This inequality is in turn justified by the insistence that women are not allowed to study the Veda.</p>
<p>Against such a background, it is no surprise to read in the Mahā- bhārata that it is the wife&rsquo;s job to look after all the items her husband will need for the sacrifice (Mbh.XIII.47.32–4). According to Trik.III.100, some authorities disregard the patni altogether; the commentary explains that she is not so much a part (anga) of the sacrifice as a part of the sacrificer, for her position is akin to that of a sacrificial utensil (vajñāpātrāṇīva patnī; Smith 1984:128). So passive is her role that the question of whether she need participate at all is raised. In Sita&rsquo;s absence, Rāma has a golden image of her made to symbolise their religious partnership in the horse-sacrifice (Rām.VII.91.25). The Aitareyabrāhmana goes even further, asking if a man without a wife may offer the agnihotra. The conclusion is not only that he may, but that he should; for a man who fails to do so is a &lsquo;mock man&rsquo; (anaddhāpuruṣa), that is, one who offers oblations</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[115]]</p>
<p>to neither gods, ancestors or men (Ait.Br.32.8.p.824-5). Bodewitz (1976:119) translates the term anaddhāpuruṣa as &lsquo;barbarian&rsquo;, taking it merely as a derogatory term. Sāyaṇa explains that such a man is &lsquo;false&rsquo; (anṛtaḥ) by virtue of his failure to perform his sacrificial duty. In another context, he glosses the term as alīkapuruṣa, &lsquo;a false or counterfeit man&rsquo; (on Sat.Br.VI.3.1.24; cf. S.B.E.XLI. p.197). Since the essential sacrificer even in the joint sacrifice is the male, failure to perform that sacrifice in the absence of a female &lsquo;second&rsquo; merely shows that he is not a &lsquo;real&rsquo; man. As Bodewitz points out (1976:119–21), a man without a wife (apatnīka) may be either a once-married man whose wife has died or disappeared, or a man who has never married. The latter alternative opens the way for the internalization of the sacrifice. The wife is substituted by faith (śraddhā; Ait.Br.32.8) or intellect (buddhi; Bodewitz 1976:121, note 10). The sacrificer now offers in and to the self. In the realm of dharmasastra, however, the substitute is a wife made of kuśa grass (upādhiś cātra kuśamayī patni) with whom a man may offer sacrifice for the rest of his life (Sm.C.II.p.442; Ait.Br.32.8.p.826; contrast Apar. on Yajñ.I.89.p.114-15). According to Trik.II.8, if the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife is absent, a wife of gold or kuśa grass (sauvarṇī kuśapatnī vā) may be substituted (cf. Trik.III.96); but the wife may never use such an image of her husband to perform the sacrifice in his absence (patyuḥ pratinidhim kṛtvā patnī naivam samācaret). Tryambaka also deals with this question of whether the wife&rsquo;s presence and &lsquo;participation&rsquo; is strictly necessary, and comes to the opposite conclusion (see below, pp. 132-41). For the moment, however, let us note simply that his ruling on the wife&rsquo;s duties in the joint sacrifice follows the trend of thought indicated by Śabara and Kumārila. In general terms, as Tryambaka explains in section IV, the good wife should be like Lopamudra, who takes her husband&rsquo;s religious duties as her own (pativratā, sadharmini) to the extent that she seems to be no more than her husband&rsquo;s shadow (tavāngacchāyayā tulyā; Sdhp.22v. 10ff.; cf. pp. 273-4, 281–2). In the context of the fire sacrifice, the patni&rsquo;s task is the supportive and peripheral one of decorating the hearth.</p>
<p>Where the patni may walk</p>
<p>Tryambaka opens his section on agniśuśrūṣā by giving two practical details: first, how the wife should enter the agnihotra hall or enclosure; secondly, where she is permitted to walk.</p>
<p>[[116]]</p>
<p>The first of these is a ruling specific to the patni. ‘For the purpose of the fire ritual, the wife should enter the agnihotra hall by its southern door.&quot; Tryambaka quotes from the Katyāyanaśrautasūtra. &lsquo;There are two doors, one to the east, another to the south; the husband enters by the eastern door, the wife by the southern one.&lsquo;8</p>
<p>These rulings indicate that Tryambaka is thinking primarily of the śrauta ritual involving three fires and taking place in a special enclosure (agnyagāra; Āp.śr.I.2.10). The ritual for setting up the sacred fires (agnyādheya, ādhana) gives details regarding the construction of this enclosure (cf. Śr.kosa I.i). Strictly speaking, two enclosures should be made (agnyagare kurvanti; Kāty.śr.IV. 7.8). First, a raised place is prepared, sloping towards the east (prācīnapravaṇam devayajanam; Ap.sr.V.4.1). Next, an east-west line is drawn. On this are marked the centres of the āhavanīya and gārhapatya fireplaces, the former to the east, the latter to the west. The āhavaniya or ‘oblatory&rsquo; fire is kindled by fire brought from the gārhapatya, and the homa offering is performed in it (Katy.śr.IV. 8.24; 1.8.44). The garhapatya or &lsquo;domestic&rsquo; fire (lit. &lsquo;belonging to the gṛhapati or master of the house&rsquo;) is kept permanently alight (Āp. śr.VI.2.13). The two fireplaces are built eight paces apart (aṣṭāsu prakrameṣu) if the sacrificer is a brahmin, eleven if he is a kṣatriya, twelve if he is a vaiśya (Āp.śr.V.4.3). Around each fire an enclosure is built. The āhavanīya enclosure, with its rafters or roof poles (vamsa) pointing east, encloses only the āhavaniya fire. The gārhapatya enclosure, with its rafters pointing north, encloses both the gārhapatya fire and, south-east of that, the dakṣina or &lsquo;southern&rsquo; fire (Katy.śr.IV.7.9; Āp.śr.V.4.2,5). These two enclosures are open to each other on the inside to form one larger unit. There are two entrances into this double fire-hall. The entrance into the ahavanīya enclosure is to the east; that into the garhapatya enclosure is to the south (Katy.śr.IV.7.10 and comm.) More specifically, the sacrificer (vajamānaḥ, Kāty.śr.comm; patiḥ, Tryambaka) should enter the āhavanīya fire-hall by the eastern door; the patnī should enter the gārhapatya fire-hall by the southern one (Katy.śr.IV.7.10 and</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[117]]</p>
<p>comm.) Additional information not supplied by Tryambaka includes the shapes of the three fireplaces (the ahavaniya is square, the garhapatya circular, the dakṣina the shape of a halfmoon; see figure 7); and where the sacrificer and his wife should sit (the former to the south-west of the āhavanīya fire; the latter to the south-west of the garhapatya fire, facing north; Ap.śr.VI.5.1.2, II.5.2,8). 9</p>

<p>There are two main points of interest here. First, the ruling that the sacrificer and his wife should enter by different doors (Sdhp.7v.10– 8r.1 &lt; Katy.śr.IV.7.10,19-20) seems to be contradicted by another ruling in Tryambaka&rsquo;s source that for the agnihotra ritual one should enter by the southern door (dakṣinena praveśanam agnihotreṣṭiṣu; Kāty.śr.IV.15.29). According to the commentary, this applies to the priest, the sacrificer and the patni. The Satapathabrāhmaṇa, however, agrees with the first ruling: the sacrificer should enter from the east (pūrveṇāhavanīyam parītya; Śat. Br.II.3.3.13); if he were to take his place after entering from the south, he would fail to reach heaven (Sat.Br.II.3.3.16). Neither Dumont nor Bodewitz draws attention to this apparent contradiction. Dumont gives only the second ruling (1939:2). Bodewitz assumes the first without</p>
<p>[[118]]</p>
<p>comment (1976:58-60 and note 5). The issue evidently needs further clarification.</p>
<p>Secondly, Tryambaka&rsquo;s brief quotation reinforces a very common but significant set of identifications and associations: the sacrificer with the ahavaniya fire and the eastern direction; the patnī with the garhapatya fire and the south. Traditionally, heaven is identified with both the ahavaniya and the east. For example, Ait.Br.25.1 (p.648) declares that the āhavaniya is sacrifice (yajña), the āhavaniya is heaven (svarga). According to Sat.Br.XII.4.1.3, the āhavaniya is the other world (antarikṣaloka; i.e. the intermediate region between earth and sky). Elsewhere, the ahavaniya is the world of the gods (devaloka; Śat.Br.VII.3.1.10, XII.9.3.10). Similarly, Śat.Br.II.3.3.16 explains that when the sacrificer walks towards the east, he is moving towards the heavenly world and will thereby gain heaven. For the eastern direction is towards the gods (Śat.Br.VII.3.2.1; XIV.2.2.28), the region of the gods (Śat.Br.III. 1.1.2,6; cf. Gonda 1980:52-7). Correspondingly, the garhapatya is identified with the terrestrial world (ayam eva lokaḥ, Śat.Br.XII. 4.1.3; manuṣyalokaḥ, VII.3.1.10). Śat.Br.VII.1.1.3 and 7 explain that the garhapatya is the size of a man and the circular shape of the womb and the earth, for it is this terrestrial world (cf. Śat.Br.IX. 2.3.14). Unlike the &lsquo;divine&rsquo; ahavaniya, the garhapatya fire is &lsquo;human&rsquo; for it is the world of men (Sat.Br.VII.3.1.10). The roof poles of the gārhapatya enclosure point north for that is the region of men and the appropriate direction for an unconsecrated person (adīkṣitasya). Only for a consecrated person (dīkṣitasya) may the poles point east as in the ahavaniya enclosure (Sat.Br.III.1.1.7; III.6.4.12). The south, however, is the direction or world of the ancestors (Śat.Br. III.1.1.2; III.6.4.12; IX.3.4.11) and, by extension, of death itself (cf. Gonda 1980:52-7). Thus the sacrificer is associated with the gods and heaven; the patnī with men and the world of the ancestors. More dramatically, if the sacrificer entered from the south as the patnī does, he would fail to reach heaven (see above, Śat.Br.II. 3.3.16). Consequently, if she does reach heaven, it will not be on her own account but by virtue of her association with her husband.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s second point concerns where the patnī is permitted to walk. ‘(Any) walking about in the agnihotra enclosure should be done along the sacred path (or place; tīrtha).&lsquo;10 The quotation that</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[119]]</p>
<p>follows is not a ruling exclusive to women but a general one concer, ning any movement within the sacrificial area. First, however, it is necessary to give some explanation of the terms used.</p>
<p>Tīrtha and samcara denote the special path (mārga; comm. on Katy.śr.I.3.42) along which one may walk within the sacrificial area. For rituals involving an uttaravedi or northern altar-such as the varuṇapraghāsa, animal and soma sacrifices-it lies between the catvāla and the utkara (Katy.śr.1.3.42 and comm.; Ap.śr.XII. 5.4, Rudradatta comm.; Aśv.śr.I.1.6 and comm.). In all istis such as the new and full moon rituals, it lies between the pranītā and the utkara (Katy.śr.I.3.43; Aśv.śr.I.1.4,7 and frontispiece, Ān.).</p>
<p>The catvāla is the trench or pit from which earth is taken to construct the mahāvedi or great altar (avaṭaḥ, comm. on Aśv.śr.I.1.6; cātvālāt purīṣam, comm. on Katy.śr.I.8.39). It is situated to the north-east of the altar (Sen 1982; plans 3,5,6). It is not included in Dumont&rsquo;s &lsquo;plan de la hutte et de l&rsquo;emplacement du sacrifice&rsquo; (1939:xv) nor in Sen&rsquo;s plan for the agnihotra, darsapurṇamāsa and iṣṭis (1982: plan 4), presumably because it is not relevant in the agnihotra. In Staal&rsquo;s diagram of the elaborate agnicayana ritual, the catvāla is positioned on the northern boundary of the mahāvedi, to the north of the bird-altar and east of the utkara. It is not included in the smaller sacrificial hall appropriate for the simple agnihotra ritual (1983:1, endpapers, 262-3, 394; 398, plate 65).</p>
<p>The utkara (‘rubbish heap&rsquo;) is a mound to the north of the altar (vedi or mahāvedi; Sen 1982: plans 3,4; Staal 1983:1, endpapers) where the earth required for constructing the altar is put (comm. on Aśv.śr.I.1.4, p.5). According to Staal, it is made in the shape of a turtle (1983:1, 258-9, plate 36B). Other discarded items such as darbha grass, and flowers and so on may also be placed there (comm. on Āp. śr.II.1.6-7). In the building of the fire-altar, for example, instructions are given that any imperfect or discoloured brick should be broken up and thrown on the utkara, the proper place for what is not needed (Sat.Br.VIII.7.2.16).</p>
<p>The praṇītā is where specially purified water is kept in a water pot, to the north-east of the altar (comm. on Asv.śr.I.1.4, p.6; Sen 1982: plan 4; Dumont 1939:xv). It is called praṇītā because the water is &lsquo;brought forward&rsquo; by the adhvaryu from the garhapatya fire to its</p>
<p>place by the ahavanīya fire (Śat.Br.I.1.1.12-21).</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s version of all this is taken from the Baudhayanadharmasutra and runs as follows. &lsquo;The sacred area (tīrtha) of (or</p>
<p>[[120]]</p>
<p>path to) the sacrifice is between the catvāla and the utkara. (When coming) from the catvāla, (it lies) between the ahavaniya fire and the utkara. Until the ritual is over, the performers of the sacrifice (i.e. the priests), the sacrificer and his wife should walk there (i.e. only along that path). When the ritual is over, they may walk around in the area where there is no utkara (i.e. on the other side of the enclosure).&lsquo;11 Tryambaka supplies his own glosses. &lsquo;Visamsthite means “as long as the ritual is not completed&quot;. Samcaraḥ means “entering and leaving&quot;. Samsthite means &ldquo;once the ritual is completed, that is, afterwards.&rsquo; &ldquo;&ldquo;12</p>
<p>The quotation is obviously a general one to be taken in so far as it is appropriate. Since the catvāla is not required for the agnihotra ritual, we may perhaps assume that the praṇītā is meant. Sen, in his diagram of the vedi for the agnihotra, darsapūrṇamāsa and istis, marks the samcaras of the sacrificer and the priests (Sen 1982: plan 4). That of the patni is missing. Tryambaka, however, includes it (cf. Katy.śr.IV.13.13 and comm.).</p>
<p>When dealing with the various instructions concerning the right way to approach the sacrifice, it is important to distinguish between three kinds of entrance or approach. First, there are the two physical entrances into the sacrificial enclosure: the eastern and the southern doors (see above). Within the enclosure lies the vihāra (lit. ‘separation&rsquo;, i.e. of the fires), the sacrificial area containing the three fires (comm. on Asv.śr.I.1.4, p.5). Before going to his place, the sacrificer should sip water from the place prescribed for sipping (acamana) inside the enclosure but outside the vihara (Aśv.śr., An., frontispiece; Sen 1982: plan 4). The vihāra itself must be approached from the north (Baudh.1.7.15.1). Sat.Br.II.3.3.14 even declares that there is a door on the northern side. But this is misleading: there is no northern entrance to the enclosure; the door is a metaphorical one within it (Bodewitz 1976: 60, note 5). Once inside the enclosure, one should walk between the garhapatya and āhavanīya fires, thus ap-</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[121]]</p>
<p>proaching the vihāra from the north. In this context, the statement that one who enters from the south will miss the sacrificial &lsquo;boat&rsquo; (literally, see Sat.Br.II.3.3.15-16) means not that the patni is barred from heaven (because she enters the enclosure from the south) but that once inside the enclosure everyone should approach the vihāra from the north. The third type of &rsquo;entrance&rsquo; is that mentioned here by Tryambaka: the sacred path to the sacrifice from the north-east by which one may come and go during the ritual, the tīrtha or samcara. Following Katyāyana (patni ca pūrvavat; Katy.śr.IV.13. 13), we may assume that this last rule of entry applies to the patnī as it does to her husband (patny api yajamānavad eva samcarena pravisya; comm.).</p>
<p>Which wife is the patni?</p>
<p>Tryambaka evidently assumes that the patni should be present at the sacrifice, both for the morning and the evening rituals (cf. Ap.śr.VI.5.1; contrast Baudh.sr.III.4.8-9; Man.śr.1.6.2.16). After the two rulings already dealt with above (see notes 1,3), his next concern is the question of which wife should be accorded this privilege. Such a problem only arises in a polygamous household.</p>
<p>In fact, although monogamy is usually presented as the ideal, polygamy seems always to have been practised, especially among royal or noble (i.e. wealthy) families. There are many references to it in the Rgveda. R.V.X.145, for example, is intended as a charm to wean the husband&rsquo;s affections away from a co-wife (cf. also R.V.X. 159; A.V.III.18). Śat.Br.XIII.4.1.9 refers to the four wives of the king, all of whom (including the pālāgalī, the low-born wife) have a part to play at the sacrifice (see above). Baudh.I.8.16.1-5 declares that a brahmin may marry four wives (i.e. one of each vama), a kṣatriya three, a vaisya two, and a sudra one; and then proceeds to discuss the mixture of caste that would result (cf. Manu III.13, v.14 refutes this; Vas.I.24-5).</p>
<p>Yet Ap.II.5.11.12 forbids a man to take a second wife as long as the first is able to produce children and perform her part in the religious sacrifice. Verse 13 adds that if the first wife is deficient in these two important respects, then he may take another wife, as long as he does so before the sacrificial fires are kindled (prāg agnyādheyāt). For Manu IX.81, the major point at issue is the wife&rsquo;s ability to bear sons: if she is barren (vandhyā), she may be superseded in the eighth year; if her children all die (mṛtaprajā), in</p>
<p>[[122]]</p>
<p>the tenth; if she bears only daughters (strijananī), in the eleventh (cf. the tenth, twelfth or fifteenth years respectively, Trik.III. 84a-5). He adds, however, that a disagreeable wife (apriyavādinī) should be superseded at once (cf. Trik.III.85b). The Smṛticandrikā puts the question in its religious perspective. Rejecting the views of Āp.II.5.11.12–13, Devannabhatta quotes another smṛti&rsquo;. If a wife is barren or produces only daughters, if she is past menstruation (vigatārtavā), diseased (vyādhitā) or insane (unmattā), then she may be abandoned. But if she is innocent of any serious crime (adustā; glossed by Kull. on Manu VIII.388 as atipātakādidoṣarahita), then she should be abandoned only in sexual terms (tīrthatah; glossed by Dev. as yonitaḥ) and not in matters of religion (na tu dharmatah; Sm.C.II. p.439-40). The institution of polygamy may therefore continue without endangering the apparently monogamous requirements of religious ritual.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s assumption here that polygamy is the norm reinforces my earlier suggestion that his treatise was intended primarily for a prosperous kṣatriya court (see pp.19-20). Certainly, the custom is unknown among the brahmin ritualists of the Apastamba tradition in Tamil Nadu both today and in the recent past (Smith 1984:133-4). It is interesting, therefore, that Tryambaka does not discuss the important question of whether the kṣatriya may sacrifice at all. For it is by no means obvious that he may.</p>
<p>Ap.śr.VI.15.10, for example, declares that a priest may not perform the agnihotra sacrifice for a kṣatriya (na rājanyasya juhuyāt). Instead, the latter should send food to a brahmin at the time of the sacrifice (or before he himself has eaten; mukhataḥ, Hir.śr.III.7.19, p.357; cf. Dumont 1939:88) to symbolise the ritual (Āp.śr.VI.15. 11). However, if a kṣatriya performs the soma sacrifice and speaks the truth (yo va somayājī satyavādî), then the priest may perform the agnihotra for him (Ap.śr. VI. 15.13; Hir.śr.III.7.19,p.357). Man.śr.I.6.1.54 explains that the agnihotra sacrifice may be performed for a kṣatriya if he observes religious law (dhārmukasya); if not, it should be performed only on newand full-moon days (parvasv itarasya); either way, the kṣatriya should send food to a brahmin daily to represent the sacrifice.</p>
<p>This exclusion of the kṣatriya is predictable. According to the Kāthakasamhita, there is no agnihotra for the kṣatriya because he ignores religious observances and takes life (avratyo hi sa hanti; Kath.Sam. VI.6,p.56). The reasons given by the Maitrāyaṇīsamhitā</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[123]]</p>
<p>are that the kṣatriya is engaged in impure actions (ayajñiyam amedhyam carati), eats food which should not be eaten (atyanannam), and defeats the brahmin (jināti brāhmaṇam; Mait.I.8.7. p. 126). On newand full-moon days, however, he keeps his observances and thus may perform the agnihotra. On the other days, he should give food to a brahmin. For the brahmin is Agni: what is eaten by the brahmin is sacrificed to Agni (Kath.Sam. VI.6.p.56). Bodewitz discusses this idea of the brahmin as the recipient of the sacrificial offering (1973:223, note 14). I shall consider the importance of the atitihipūjā for the kṣatriya householder in section IIC, pp. 183-210. For the moment, we need only note two apparently contradictory points. First, Tryambaka assumes the practice of polygamy, a custom normally associated with kṣatriyas, thereby implying a predominantly kṣatriya court. Secondly, he advocates the twice-daily agnihotra sacrifice without qualification or proviso regarding the kṣatriya lifestyle.</p>
<p>Problems relating to polygamy and sacrificial ritual date back a long way. The pūrvamīmāmsakas, for example, discuss whether or not the term patnî should be given in the dual or plural to coincide with the actual number of the sacrificer&rsquo;s wives. As Sabara explains on Jai.IX.3.20, a text used in newand full-moon sacrifices instructs one to ‘attire the wife&rsquo; (patnīm sannahya). If the sacrificer has more than one wife, should he employ the modification (ūha) of number in order to make the singular reference dual or plural? Jaimini rules that there should be no modification (avikāraḥ; Jai.IX.3.20). Śabara explains that the term patnī is used merely to indicate the sacrificer&rsquo;s assistant and is not intended as a reference to the number of his wives (na cātra dvitvam bahutvam vā vivakṣyate). Even in the case of a modified sacrifice in which more than one wife participates, there should be no modification of the text (Jai.IX.3.21 and Sab.). Thus, however many wives an individual man may have, for the purpose of religious ritual the sacrificer has only one patnī.</p>
<p>I have already discussed the views of Jaimini and Panini regarding the definition of patnī (section IIB, pp.107–15). Only the wife who shares in the sacrifice and its rewards with her husband may be called patni. All other wives are merely jāyā (&lsquo;one who gives birth&rsquo;) or bhāryā (‘one who is to be supported or maintained&rsquo;, presumably because she bears children). In fact, throughout his treatise on the religious duties of women, Tryambaka adheres to Panini&rsquo;s rule, using the word patnī only in connection with the sacrifice. For, in</p>
<p>[[124]]</p>
<p>the context of a largely polygamous court society, it is too limiting a term. He usually prefers the most general terms such as strī, nārī and yoṣit, words which do not distinguish between &lsquo;woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;wife&rsquo; (but which in the context of Tryambaka&rsquo;s approach can only mean the latter; see section III). Words denoting an unmarried woman (e.g. kanya, &lsquo;daughter&rsquo;, &lsquo;unmarried girl&rsquo;) appear rarely, as in the description of Parvati as &lsquo;daughter of the Himalayas&rsquo; (section I, p. 30, note 2). Words carrying associations of chastity (e.g. satī), devotion (e.g. pativrata) and the &lsquo;good fortune&rsquo; associated with marriage (e.g. sumangalī, saubhāgyavatī) are more common; as are those denoting the negative aspects of the &lsquo;unwifely&rsquo; woman (e.g. pumścalī, ‘one who runs after men&rsquo;, a loose woman; cf. section III, p. 248, note 9). In the context of the fire ritual, however, Tryambaka is concerned not so much with definition as with the practical problems of a polygamous household. For detailed rules are laid down regarding precedence among wives.</p>
<p>Tryambaka explains. &lsquo;If a man has many wives, the worship of fire should be performed only by the senior wife.&lsquo;13</p>
<p>Jyestha (lit. &lsquo;first, &lsquo;best&rsquo;, &rsquo;eldest&rsquo;) means the wife that a man marries first (jyestha prathamoḍha; Medh. on Manu IX.122). In discussions concerning the precedence of either the wives themselves or of their sons (e.g. in matters of inheritance), the first or senior wife is usually contrasted with any subsequent or junior wife (paścād uḍhā kaniṣṭhā; Medh. on Manu IX.122). The reason is clear. The wife who is married first participates in the kindling of the sacred fires. She thus becomes associated with the religious rites celebrated in them (Ap.II.11.14; Sm.C.II.p.438). A wife who is married subsequently, once the sacred fires are already established, is therefore deemed a &lsquo;second (dvitīyā; Sm.C.II.p. 439, Viṣṇu) or &lsquo;junior&rsquo; (kaniṣṭhā) wife. The first wife is thus the legitimate one, married with full ceremony, and both intended and required to participate in her husband&rsquo;s religious obligations (prathamā dharmapatnī syād; Sm.C.II.p.439, Katy.; cf. Trik. III.93). She is usually of the same varna as her husband (cf. Manu III.12). His religious duty fulfilled, a man may then remarry for more personal reasons such as sexual pleasure (dvitīyā rativardhinī; Sm.C.II.p.439, Kāty.). Katyāyana adds that the rewards of any subsequent union</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[125]]</p>
<p>are &lsquo;seen&rsquo; or obvious (drstam eva phalam); but, unlike the first marriage, such a union produces no &lsquo;unseen&rsquo; or otherworldly effect (nādṛṣṭam upapadyate; Sm.C.II.p.439, Kāty.). According to one of the three views put forward by the Trikāṇḍamandana, a wife married for pleasure has no entitlement (adhikāra) to the sacrifice (Trik.I.44b, see above). It follows that junior wives need not be of the same varna as their husband.</p>
<p>It is evidently assumed that the first wife will be of the same varṇa as her husband. If this is not the case, however, the term jyestha cannot be applied to the wife married first. For varna is more important than timing (cf. section IIC, pp. 165–6, note 12.) As Manu IX.85 explains, if twice-born men marry women of different varṇas, then seniority (jyaisthyam), honour (pūjā) and living quarters (vesman) should be allocated according to varna (tāsām varṇakramena). The jyeṣṭhā is thus the first wife of the same varna as her husband. For only that wife is entitled to attend to her husband&rsquo;s personal needs (sarīrasuśruṣām) and to participate in the daily religious rituals (dharmakaryam va naityakam; Manu IX.86). If a man has several wives of the same varna, then he should offer sacrifice with the &rsquo;eldest&rsquo; among them, that is, with the one he married first (jyeṣthayā saha; Vis. Sm.26.1). However, if he has several wives of different varnas, he should offer sacrifice with one of the same varna as himself, even if she is the &lsquo;youngest&rsquo; or most recently married wife of all (kaniṣṭhayāpi; Viṣ.Sm.26.2).</p>
<p>Tryambaka continues. According to Yajnavalkya, &lsquo;if a man has a wife of the same varna (as himself), then he should not ask any other (wife not of the same varna) to perform this religious duty. If he has several wives of the same varna (as himself), then no-one except the senior wife (should be appointed) in religious rites.&lsquo;14</p>
<p>Several possibilities are hinted at here. Ideally, the patni is of the same varna as the sacrificer. Thus anyone who foolishly (mohāt) appoints a wife of a lower varṇa to perform the joint sacrifice when the wife of equal varna is alive is held in the same contempt as a cāndāla (Manu IX.87 and Ragh.); or as a brahmin-killer (Sm.C.II. p.438, Katy.); and his acts will bear no fruit (Sm.C.II.p.439, Visnu). If he has more than one wife of the same varṇa, then he should appoint the most senior among them (jyesthaiva sahadharma-</p>
<p>[[126]]</p>
<p>cārinī; Apar. on Yajñ.I.88). The implication-spelled out by Viṣ.Sm.26.3-is that if there is no wife of the same varṇa (samānavarṇāyā abhāve), then he should appoint as patnī a wife from the next varna (anantarayaiwa). Nandapandita explains that a brahmin may appoint a kṣatriya wife, a kṣatriya may appoint a vaisya wife. This ruling also holds in times of difficulty (apadi ca; glossed by Nand. to mean &lsquo;if the wife of the same varna has not returned in time or if a serious accident has befallen her&rsquo;).</p>
<p>But on no account may a sūdra wife play the part of patnī (Viṣ.Sm. 26.4; Manu III.14). For a woman of ‘the black varna&rsquo; (kṛṣṇavarṇā yā rāmā)—that is, a sudra woman-is intended for sexual pleasure (ramaṇāyaiva) and not for religious ritual (Vas.XVIII,18; Apar. on Yājā.1.88; Sm.C.II.p.437; Par.M.I.ii.p.116). I have already noted that the wife of a sūdra has no right to the title or office of patni because her husband is not entitled to offer sacrifice (see section II B, p. 110). In the case cited here, however, the right of the twice-born husband is not at issue. Yet the sudra wife still may not act as patnī. Indeed, the gods and ancestors will not accept any offering in which she has taken part (Manu III.18). For the dharmapatnī must be without fault (nirdoṣā; Sm.C.II.p.438, Dakṣa); and the sūdra woman is demonstrably (i.e by virtue of her birth) at fault. So degraded is she, that she will demote the brahmin who marries her to her own level of sūdra (Manu III.15–19). We must conclude, therefore, that—at least in the context of religious ritual, and with reference to the sudra woman alone—the widespread idea (noted in section I) that the varṇa of a wife is defined by that of her husband &lsquo;just as a river merges with the sea&rsquo; no longer applies.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the jyestha is at fault (doṣe satī; Sm.C.II.p.438, Daksa), she can no longer be the dharmapatni: she must be replaced. Tryambaka explains. ‘If the jyeṣṭhā is at fault, then (the ritual duty) must be performed by a junior wife.&lsquo;15 He quotes Katyāyana to the same effect. &lsquo;If a man has many wives, then such rituals as the agnihotra should be performed with a wife of the same varna as himself; if there are many of the same varna, then with the senior wife as long as she is not at fault.&lsquo;16</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>[[127]]</p>
<p>Two points may be made here. First, it is unclear when a wife is sufficiently &lsquo;at fault&rsquo; to be disqualified from taking part in the joint sacrifice. We have already established that she may be rejected sexually for any number of reasons ranging from barrenness and disease to insanity, but none of these bar her from the joint sacrifice (Sm.C.II.p.440). The implication is that only a serious crime (atipātakādidoṣa; Kull. on Manu VIII.388) can do that. The Trikāndamandana suggests infidelity and hostility to one&rsquo;s husband (vyabhicāravatī . dveṣini drohiṇi; Trik.I.79c); alternatively, sexual intercourse with his student or teacher, or (deliberately) aborting a foetus (śisyagām gurugām garbhahantrim; Trik.III.89). Secondly, the replacement should ideally be of the same varṇa as the husband. Neither Tryambaka nor Katyāyana suggests that even an unsuitable jyesthā may be replaced by a wife of a lower varna. However, an atipātaka crime must constitute a time of distress or difficulty (apadi; cf. Viṣ.Sm.26.3). Under these circumstances, the replacement may be of the next varna down.</p>
<p>If there are several junior wives of the same varna, however, how should the choice be made? According to Tryambaka, &lsquo;when there are several junior wives, (the religious ritual) should be performed by one who is the mother of sons (lit. &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;). If several junior wives have borne sons, then it should be performed by one who is obedient to (her husband&rsquo;s) command, full of good qualities, and solicitous (dakṣa; lit. &ldquo;skilful&rdquo;, &ldquo;clever&rdquo;, &ldquo;industrious&rdquo;).&lsquo;17 In support of the latter ruling, Tryambaka quotes Kātyāyana. ‘From among those of his wives who have given birth to sons, he should appoint one who is obedient to (his) command, solicitous, gentleūvoiced and pure (in character).&lsquo;18</p>
<p>siṣṭādi for agnihotrādi&rdquo;, bahutvam cej for bahutve ca, Kāty.); Apar. on Yājā.1.88 (agnisiṣṭādi for agnihotrādi, tu jyeṣṭhā yā for ca jyeṣṭhayā, Kāty.); Par.M.I.ii.p.117, Kāty..</p>
<p>[[128]]</p>
<p>However, Tryambaka continues: &lsquo;if that (wife who has been appointed) is unable to perform the various services (suśrūṣādi) (required of her) every day, then each (wife) should do them in turn day by day in order of seniority. (Alternatively,) if the one (who has been appointed for that day) is unable (to take care of everything required of her) within the one day, then all the wives should take part: they should divide the work (between them), each according to her (particular) knowledge (or expertise).&lsquo;19 As evidence for these rulings, Tryambaka quotes Kātyāyana&rsquo;s considerably abbreviated version of the same ideas. ‘If (one wife) is unable (to do everything every day), then (they should all take it) in turn; according to the (nature of the) work and in order of seniority. If (one wife) is unūable (to do everything within one day), then they should (all) do (it) at once, dividing (the work between them) according to their expertise. &lsquo;20</p>
<p>It seems that Tryambaka is now suggesting that all the wives of the sacrificer may assist their husband in the joint ritual. This is certainly one of the three views mentioned in Trik.I.43-4. Given Tryambaka&rsquo;s previous rulings, however, it seems an unlikely conclusion for him to reach. I suggest that he is no longer discussing which wife should assist her husband in the joint sacrifice. Instead, the general term suśruṣādi probably covers all the duties that might come under the heading of stridharma, whether religious or domestic (see section V, pp. 312-13). In this more general sense, then, the wives in a polygamous household should share the availūable work between them in accordance with both their individual talents and the accepted rules of precedence. In fact, the rule is vague enough to allow for almost any eventuality. (For a vivid autobiographical account by a co-wife of life in a joint family today, see Bennett 1983:187-200.)</p>
<p>At Dawn</p>
<p>At which point should the wife participate?</p>
<p>[[129]]</p>
<p>According to Tryambaka, the ritual ‘adorning of the fire&rsquo; (agnyaūlankaraṇam)—which he has already established as the wife&rsquo;s part in the ceremony (section IIB, pp. 107–15)—should be perūformed immediately after such activities as sweeping round (the fires; parisamūhanādy).”21 His evidence for this is a quotation attributed to Baudhāyana. &ldquo;The (learned) teachers declare that one should always (i.e. when oblations are offered) sweep around (the fires), sprinkle water around (them), strew darbha grass around (them), pour water around (them), put fuel on (them), and (then) adorn (the hearth).&lsquo;22</p>
<p>These are all preliminary rituals to be performed after the fires have been lit (uddharanam; see below) and before the central ritual of offering cow&rsquo;s milk into the fire. Parisamūhana is the ritual of wiping with a wet hand three times around each of the three fires in turn, moving from the north-east to the north and keeping one&rsquo;s right side towards the fire, while reciting mantras (Śānkh.gṛ.I.7.11; Aśv.gr.1.3.1. and comm.). According to some, it is performed either before or after the agnihotra offering; according to others, it is performed both before and after it (Āp.śr.VI.3.1-3; Hir.śr.III.7. 16, p.341). Tryambaka evidently assumes it should be done beforeūhand. Paryukṣaṇa is the ritual sprinkling of water with mantras around each of the fires, again going from north-east to north (Āśv.śr.II.2.11–13 and comm.; Man.śr.I.6.1.10). Paristarana is the ritual scattering of darbha grass round the fires as in the darsaūpūrṇamāsa sacrifice; that is, so that the grasses to the east and west point north, and those to the north and south point east (Katy.śr.IV. 13.15 and comm.; Āp.śr.VI.3.5; Hir.śr.III.7.16, p.341; Mān.śr.I. 6.1.11). Pariṣecana is the ritual pouring of water around the fires (Ap.śr. VI.5.4, Rudradatta comm.). Upasamādhāna is the act of placing fuel on the fires to ensure that they are burning properly. In Baudhāyana&rsquo;s list of preliminary ritual acts, that of adorning the hearth comes after these.</p>
<p>It is clear, even from this brief quotation,, that Tryambaka&rsquo;s</p>
<? 

 

[[130]]

emphasis is quite different from that of Baudhāyana. The latter merely lists the various actions leading up to the offering of milk, without indicating which should be performed by whom. Tryūambaka, having defined the wife's participation in the ritual as alankara, uses Baudhāyana's quotation to demonstrate when she should play her part. 

According to some, however, all that is required of the patnī is her presence. Katy.śr.IV.13.13, quoted above (section IIB, p. 121), explains that the patni enters the sacrificial enclosure and takes her place in the vihara in the same way as her husband does. But the paddhati on the commentary remarks that, according to oral tradition (sampradaya), the patnī does nothing else beyond taking her seat (upavesanavyatiriktam patnī kim api na karoti; Weber edn., p. 404). Now even the act of decorating the hearth is denied her. Moreover, as Tryambaka turns his attention to the issue of when the patni should take her seat, he too seems to have accepted this even more restrictive definition of her role. For there is in fact no further reference to her participation in the ritual. 

Tryambaka continues. 'Apastamba declares that the patnī should take her seat in her own place immediately after the ritual of milking.'23 The quotation reads as follows. "The agnihotra should be performed by a man together with his wife; the wife should take her seat in her own place. 24 'However, Baudhāyana maintains that the wife should take her seat immediately after the fire has been taken (from the gārhapatya fire to light the other two fires).'25 The quotaūtion for this statement reads: 'the patni should be present at the evening and the morning (sacrifice).”26 

The patni's 'own place' (svāyatana) is the seat assigned to her for the duration of the ritual, to the south-west of the garhapatya fire (Āp.śr.II.5.2; Baudh.I.7.15.26; Sen 1982: plan 4). 

The ritual of milking (dohana) is described in some detail in the srautasūtras. According to some, the agnihotra cow may not be

milked by a sudra (Kāty.śr.IV.14.1); according to others, it may (Āp.śr.VI.3.11–14). According to some, the cow should be acūcompanied by a male calf (pumvatsa; Kāty.śr.IV.14.1); according to others, the calf may be female (strīvatsa; Śāṁkh.śr.II.8.6–7). The cow is placed to the south of the āhavaniya enclosure with its head facing north, north-east or east. The calf is brought to it, then taken away. Finally, the cow is milked. A special earthenware vessel (agnihotrasthālī; defined Āp.śr.VI.3.7 and comm.) is used to collect the milk (Kāty.śr.IV.14.1 and comm.; Ap.śr.VI.3.15). 

Uddharanam is the ritual lighting of the ahavaniya fire with a brand or coals taken from the garhapatya (gārhapatyād āhavanī- yasyoddharaṇam; Kāty.śr.IV.13.2). It is performed by the priest and is the first of the series of rituals that form the agnihotra sacrifice. Soon afterwards, the sacrificer takes his place (Kāty.śr.IV.13.12). The patni enters the vihara at the same juncture and along the same path (Kāty.śr.IV.13.13). According to the Baudhāyanaśrautasūtra, before the cow is milked, the priest should enflame the garhapatya fire, transport the flame to the āhavanīya, and arrange the sacriūficial utensils (Baudh.śr.III.4.1-6). In this text, however, there is no clear instruction concerning when the patni should take her place. The sutra quoted by Tryambaka (Baudh.śr.III.4.8; see note 26) merely makes the general statement that her presence is required at the sacrifice. Moreover, Tryambaka fails to mention the following sūtra which seriously undermines this ruling: that is, according to some, she need only attend the evening sacrifice (sāyamsāyam ity eke; Baudh.śr.III.4.9), and not the morning one at all. However, he does quote it in his section on evening rituals (see section IID, note 2). Mān.śr.I.6.2.16 agrees (sāyam patny anvāste na prātaḥ). In the Apastambasrautasutra, on the other hand, the instructions referring to the patnī are given after both the uddharana and dohana rituals have been described (Ap.śr. VI.5.1-2) Sdhp.8v.8-9, note 24). But this is not exclusive to the patnī. For in Āp.śr.V1.5.3, we read that the sacrificer too must make his way to his seat in the prescribed way. Thus both sacrificer and wife are present for the crucial homa ritual. 

Tryambaka concludes. 'The important thing is that both (husūband and wife) should be present for the homa offering.'27 

[^27]: home tūbhayoh sannidhanam mukham // Sdhp.8v.10. 

[[132]]

How important is the presence of either husband or wife? 

Tryambaka begins with the question of the husband's absence. 'If the sacrificer is not present then his wife certainly should be.'28 He quotes Katyāyana. 'If both husband and wife are absent, the sacrifice may not be performed by a priest. For when both (husband and wife) are absent, the offering is worthless. '29 'But if a brahmin has business to take care of, he may assign (the responsibility of) the fire to his wife, appoint a priest (to conduct the ritual), and then leave home. But he should not stay away for long unnecessarily.'30 

The first point to notice here is that the religious obligation to perform the daily agnihotra ritual does not require a man to stay at home all the time. Indeed, the absence of the householder was a common enough occurrence for rulings to be made about it. This becomes particularly obvious when we realize what is meant by 'leaving home'. Trik.III.62-4 and 66 define it variously as going to the outskirts of the village (gramāntam), going beyond the village boundary (sīmāntam), crossing a river that flows directly into the sea (nadim ambudhigāminīm), and so on. Such constricting definiūtions make it necessary for the husband to be allowed to 'leave home'. The resulting rulings lay down what constitutes a good reason for going; and what precautions he should take. Manu IX. 74, for example, declares that a man who has business to attend to (kāryavān) away from home should see to the maintenance of his wife while he is away; for even a virtuous woman is corrupted when distressed for the lack of it (avṛttikarṣitā). A man might journey abroad for any number of reasons related to his individual fulfilment (puruṣārtha, Medh.; as opposed to reasons relating to the sacrifice, kratvartha). Manu IX.76 mentions several: religious reasons

(dharmakaryārtham); to acquire learning (vidyartham); to gain fame or ensure a good reputation (yaso 'rtham); and for the sake of pleasure (kāmārtham; glossed by Kull. as bhāryantaropabhogartham, 'to enjoy the favours of another woman', or perhaps ‘another wife'). Manu's concern is to lay down rules for how long a woman should wait for her husband to return. Tryambaka, in his section on the duties of the wife whose husband is away, explains how such a woman should dress and behave (see p. 291). Here, however, he is concerned with the arrangements that a man must make regarding the daily fire ritual if he has to go away. 

Tryambaka's emphasis is quite different from Manu's. While the latter decrees that a deserted wife should wait for her husband for three, six or eight years (Manu IX.76), Tryambaka insists that he should not stay away long without good reason. While Manu and his commentators list the reasons a man might have to go away, Tryambaka rules that the only acceptable reason for such a journey is to earn money in order to pay the costs of the daily fire sacrifice. Moreover, the freedom to leave home to earn this money applies only to the man, never to his wife. 

Tryambaka explains. "This injunction regarding leaving home is acceptable (only) for the purpose of earning money and only in relation to a man. In the case of the wife (patnī), since she does not (or is not expected to) earn money, she need not leave home.'31 Tryambaka uses the word patni here to suit the context of the wife who participates in the joint sacrifice. The ruling itself, however, would clearly apply to any wife. Tryambaka does not consider the question of the unsupported wife; Manu does. If a man goes away without providing for his wife in his absence, she may earn her own living by 'blameless handicrafts' (śilpair agarhitair; Manu IX.75). Tryambaka, writing from within the sheltered confines of a court, evidently does not envisage the possibility of a wife needing to earn money for herself. But if such a thing were necessary, like Manu, Tryambaka would undoubtedly expect her to earn her living within the home. According to the Trikāndamandana, however, a wife may travel abroad as long as either her husband or one of her co-wives is tending the sacred fires (Trik.III.67; cf. III.58,61). 

[^31]: ayam ca pravāsavidhiḥ / arthārthatayā puruṣasyaivānumataḥ // patnyās tuПarthārjanābhāvān na pravāsaḥ // Sdhp.9r.3-4. 

 

[[134]]

Tryambaka continues with an unattributed quotation taken from the Trikāndamandana. 'But (it is otherwise) for a man. It is reasonūable for a man who performs the (daily) agnihotra ritual to leave home in order to earn money, because the sacrifice can only take place if there is money (to pay for it). But he should not go away for (other reasons) such as going on a pilgrimage (tīrthādyartham).'32, In fact, 'leaving home for the purpose of going on a pilgrimage is forbidden on account of this ruling that (staying at) home and (attending to) all the duties of the household(er) is the best thing for the man who is entitled to perform sacrificial rituals. Thus the ancient sages forbid the man who is established in the householder stage of life to go (on any pilgrimage) to a sacred place. '33 

Tryambaka's description of the sacrifice that can only take place if there is sufficient money is obviously a reference to the śrauta fires (see pp.103-5). These are established, not at marriage like the aupaūsana fire, but when a man already has a son and is wealthy enough to be able to afford to pay the priests. Vas. VIII.9 explains that a man who has ‘enough (wealth) to set up the (three) fires' (alam agnyadheyāya) should become an agnihotrin. And if he has 'enough' to cover the expenses of a soma sacrifice (alam ca somāya), then he should perform that too (Vas.VIII.10). Alam is glossed by Devannabhatta as samartha: if, that is, he has the 'capacity' or 'means' (Sm.C.II.p.417). With regard to the soma sacrifice, this 'capacity' or 'means' is defined by Manu XI.7 as having enough food to support one's dependants (bhrtyavṛttaye) for three years or more (traivārṣikam bhaktam... adhikam vāpi; cf. Yājñ.I.124; Sm.C.II.p.417-18). With regard to setting up the srauta fires, Devannabhatta explains that a man must be wealthy (dhane sati), not poor (nirdhanaḥ, Prajapati; alpadhanaḥ, Dev.; Sm.C.II. p.420). This is undoubtedly what Tryambaka means when he rules that a man may leave home in order to earn money for the sacrifice. Only if the sacrifice itself is endangered by the lack of money to pay

expenses may the householder (i.e. agnihotrin) relinquish his personal responsibility for it, and that only briefly. 

Unlike Manu IX.76, Tryambaka does not allow the householder to leave home for the sake of glory or amorous adventures. Even the desire to visit sacred places, such as the Ganges or the Himalayas, is unacceptable. Given the history of the Thanjavur Marathas (see Leslie 1983(2):appendix B), this is curious. For every one of their grandfathers, householders by definition, must have left their homes in Maharashtra to seek their fortunes in the south. Some of them may have taken their wives with them at the outset, but most must have travelled alone, perhaps sending for their wives and families later. This is an important point. For these rules apply only to the householder who leaves home alone. If he takes his wife with him, then he should also take the sacred fires. Husband and wife would thus continue to perform the agnihotra together. But if he travels alone, the fires must remain at home under the guardianship of his wife; and in that case, he should only leave home in order to earn money to pay for the sacrifice. Clearly, those engaged in or acūcompanying military expeditions a generation or two earlier took little notice of such requirements. They were similarly untroubled by rulings that one's right to sacrifice is destroyed by living in another country, for example, in such barbarous places as Bengal and Kalinga (e.g. Trik.I.164). 

The Smṛticandrikā makes some allowance in this direction. Acūcording to Paithīnasī, if one's sacrificial duties are interrupted as a result of being harassed by enemies (pīdyamānasya satrubhiḥ), then one is allowed two months' grace (Sm.C.II.p.436). Perhaps by Tryambaka's time, in the uneasy peace of Mughal supervision, such a proviso was no longer necessary. Perhaps by then the rulings of pious brahmins were more firmly reinstated. Or perhaps Tryamūbaka merely believed they should be. Alternatively, the ruling that a kṣatriya (and a vaiśya; comm. on Aśv.śr.II.1.3-5) might send food to a brahmin in lieu of the ritual may have been made precisely to allow him more time to attend to his main occupation (see pp. 122–3). 

Tryambaka returns to an earlier statement and quotation conūcerning the patnī (see note 24 above). 'With reference to the wife, however, Āpastamba's ruling that "the agnihotra should be (perūformed) by a man together with his wife" defines the close connection tion (sambandha) of the wife to the sacrifice. She should therefore 

 

[[136]]

never abandon the agnihotra, nor stay elsewhere. '34 

The plural term, āpastambācāryaiḥ (see notes 34, 44) requires some clarification. Its use here, as in most late texts, indicates not several 'teachers' but a single authority deserving of special respect. Initially a custom in modern Indian languages (e.g. Marathi, Gujaūrati), especially with named teachers, this honorific plural percolated back into Sanskrit at a fairly late date (LSJ). Since Tryambaka reserves such respect solely for Apastamba, this almost certainly means that he belonged to the Apastambaśākhā of the Kṛṣṇaūyajurveda tradition (cf. p.25; Leslie 1983 (2), appendix C). 

'Staying elsewhere' means away from home and thus away from the agnihotra enclosure and the sacrifice. Tryambaka's point is that there is an essential link between the patnī and the sacrifice; more specifically, between the patni and the sacred fires. I shall return to this point below. For the moment, we need only note that the sacrifice may proceed in the absence of the husband but never in the absence of the wife (cf. Trik.III.57–60; but also Trik.III.61). 

Tryambaka anticipates the objection that the wife should be allowed to go on pilgrimages. It is certainly true that all over India today large numbers of women embark on long pilgrimages, both for their own and for their families' sakes (cf. Morinis 1984:302); and it seems likely that it was always so. (For a statistical analysis of the purposes of pilgrimage in West Bengal today, see Morinis 1984:312–16; for a more general account of pilgrim motivation throughout India, see Bhardwaj 1983:148-62.) But the practice is condemned most emphatically by Tryambaka. 

'According to the scriptures, all the rewards obtained by visiting sacred places are (to be found) in the agnihotra itself. '35 Tryambaka quotes from the Trikāndamandana. 'Brahmā, Visṇu, Siva, Surya, cows and brahmins, ancestors and gods, ritual observances, places of pilgrimage and austerities; all these are (to be found) in the agnihotra hall.'36 The quotation continues with three lines of 

[^34]: patnyās tu [/] patnīvad asyāgnihotram bhavati (< Āp.sr.VI.5.1) // iti āpastambācāryaiḥagnihotre patnisambandhaniyamanāt // agnihotram vihāya kutrāpi na stheyam // Sdhp.9r.7-9 (niyamāt, ‘ruling' is corrected in the margin to niyamanāt, ‘definition'). Cf. 24.

commentary that qualify the claim. 'But we say that not even all the places of pilgrimage (together) can equal the agnihotra. Or, alterūnatively, only when a (learned) brahmin has relinquished his right to perform the sacrifice (yajñādhikāre... nivṛtte) may he wander about visiting sacred places. For the great sages who are by nature without sin have declared that the merit (to be found) in (visiting) a sacred place is the reward of the sacrifice.'37 For, as the Trikāndaūmandana explains elsewhere, all sacred places reside in the altar itself (sarvāni tīrthāni vasanti vedyām), and all deities may be worshipped in the agnihotra ritual; it is therefore pointless (vyartham) to journey abroad in order to worship any one of these (Trik., prakīrṇakānda 27). Interestingly, Morinis' comments on 'the anti-pilgrimage tradition in Hinduism' do not even touch on this orthodox, speciūfically dharmasastric theme of the rejection of pilgrimage on the grounds of the superiority of the agnihotra ritual; presumably because it has little relevance today (1984:74-6). 

The question of going on pilgrimages is raised in two other sections of Tryambaka's treatise. In his rulings on things to be avoided, the practice of going on pilgrimages (tīrthayātra) is inūcluded among the six things that cause women and sudras to fall (strīsūdrapatanāni ṣat; see section IV, note 7). In the section on general behaviour (see p. 273-4), a lengthy passage attributed to Bṛhaspati's praise of Lopamudra in the Skandapurāṇa includes the following. '(The good wife) should stay well away from festivals and public gatherings. She should not go on pilgrimages and so on, or to such things as weddings or public shows.'38 'If a woman wants to bathe in a sacred place (tīrthasnānārthinī), then she should drink the water used to bathe her husband's feet (patipādodakam). For, in the case of a woman, her own husband is superior to even Sankara (Siva) or Visṇu.'39

The latter ruling seems to presuppose a brahmin husband, for the water used to give a ritual (as opposed to a ‘dirt-removing') bath to the feet of brahmins is traditionally considered purifying, on a par with the waters of the Ganges. Similarly, at a traditional initiation ceremony (when it genuinely indicates the beginning of Vedic education), men and (especially) women come to receive the tīrtha or purifying water used to bathe the initiate's feet. Water is cereūmonially dropped onto the child's big toe, collected and given as angusthajala. Nowadays, since most brahmin boys go through the ritual before going to ordinary schools, the water has no such purifying properties. Even fifty years ago, however, orthodox women in Maharashtra still drank the angusthajala of their brahmin husbands (LSJ). According to Lynn Bennett, village women in Nepal still do this before every rice meal (1938:174-5; and a striking photograph of a wife washing her husband's feet before drinking the gora pani or 'foot water', p. 175 and cover; see also section IIC, pp. 221–7). 

To return to the Strī-dharma-paddhati, the parallel rulings for the husband (in this section) and for the wife (section IV, pp. 273-4), are startlingly different. Both are forbidden to go on pilgrimages but, while the man is directed to find the fruits of pilgrimage in the fire sacrifice, his wife should seek them in the water used to bathe her husband's feet. The difference in the religious spheres of husband and wife could not be more graphically stressed. 

Regarding Tryambaka's assertion that a brahmin may indulge in pilgrimages only when he has relinquished his right to perform the sacrifice, this only occurs when he renounces the life of the houseūholder to become a forest hermit or an ascetic. As long as he is a householder, therefore, he will gain greater merit by performing the sacrifice than by any other form of worship. This ruling-given in the masculine, and applied by Tryambaka to the patni and thus, by extension, to all women-presupposes the aśrama system. Acūcording to the ideal classification presented by Manu (i.e. the later samuccaya version), a man should progress from childhood through four temporary stages: Vedic student, householder, forest hermit, and renouncer or ascetic. The artificiality of the system is clear, evidence of the orthodox delight in classification. In fact, as indiūcated above, early formulations of the theory give the four āśramas as alternatives (Gaut.I.3.1-3,35; Baudh.II.6.11.12-16,27). As the ascetic movement grew, however, it became important to 

 

At Dawn 

[[139]]

assimilate the new ideas into the orthodox system. The theory of the four successive stages emerged with renunciation as an integral part at the end of the line (Manu IV.1, VI.33; Olivelle 1974, 1978,1984; cf. section I, pp. 44-5. 

But none of this applies to women (cf. Leslie 1980:46ff.; 1983(1): 99 ff.). In all dharmasastra texts, women are dealt with outside the framework of asrama. We have already seen how they were gradualūly excluded from Vedic studentship (see section I). For men, the third āśrama soon became obsolete (cf. Olivelle 1978:32). For women, it had only ever been a continuation of married life. For, as Manu explains, a man embarking on this stage may either commit his wife to his sons' keeping (putreṣu... nikṣipya) or take her with him (VI.3). For her, it is simply another form of wifely obedience, not a voluntary renunciation on her own behalf. The fourth asrama was theoretically barred to women as it was to sūdras (cf. Olivelle 1984:113-15). For, according to the rules of dharmaśāstra, only those who had embarked on the first stage of Vedic education could graduate to the fourth. Women were excluded on social grounds too. For renunciation implies independence from family and social control whereas women were seen to be always dependent (Manu V.147-9; Vas. V.1-2; cf. section IV, p. 276, note 9). Apart from women's lack of freedom, the concept of 'female ascetic' is itself an anomaly. For women are so identified with both family life and sexual pleasure that the idea of a woman renouncing these things is (from the orthodox male point of view) a contradiction in terms. Nonetheless, the renunciation of women was a common enough occurrence for there to be frequent rulings against it (e.g. Manu VIII. 363; Yājñ.II.293; Vis.Sm.XXV.12). Tryambaka even includes the female ascetic (pravrajitā, śramaṇā) among the types of women the virtuous wife should strive to avoid (see pp. 170-2). 

In the realm of dharmasastra, however, a woman may never renounce the household life of her own volition, either to go into the forest as a hermit or to pursue the ascetic life. From the man's point of view, she is the household. Separation from it comes only with death-her own or her husband's-or with disgrace. Only as a widow (cf. Vas. 19.29,33-4) or an abandoned woman may she wander from place to place. As a respectable wife, certainly as the privileged patnī, she should remain with the sacred fires at home. 

Tryambaka returns to the quotation already given above (see note 29) and attributed there to Katyayana. 'When both (husband 

 

[[140]]

and wife) are absent, the offering is worthless.' According to Tryamūbaka, 'the ruling concerning the close connection between the patnī (and the sacred fires of the agnihotra) is equally applicable to the aupāsana ritual since Katyāyana's statement given above is common (to both).'40 

The question of Tryambaka's relative interest in and distinction between the śrauta and grhya rituals is discussed above (see pp. 103- 5). More important, what is the special relationship between the patni and the sacred fire or fires? According to Apastamba, the wife who is present at the kindling of the fires (ādhāne hi satī) becomes linked with the sacrificial rituals performed with them (karmabhiḥ sambadhyate; Ap.II.5.11.14; cf. Sm.C.II.p.438). But what effect does this special link have? 

The Smrticandrika discusses the issue at length. According to śruti, those who kindle the sacred fires are cremated with them (āhitāgnibhir dahanti; Sm.C.II.p.441). In theory, this applies to both sacrificer and wife. As Apastamba explains, whoever dies first is cremated with the three srauta fires of the agnihotra; whoever dies second is cremated with the single aupāsana fire (Sm.C.II.p.443). In fact, however, if the patnī dies first, the sacrificer may either promote an existing second wife or remarry, rekindling the fires for his second patnī (punah parinīya tayā sahādhānam; Sm.C.II.p.441). According to Yajñ.I.89, he should do so without delay (avilamūbayan; sighrain eva, Mit.). For a man should not remain for even a day without an āśrama (anāśrami ... kṣaṇam ekam api, Dakṣa I.10; dinam ekam api, Mit. on Yajñ.I.89). A widower can, of course, become a renouncer (Baudh.II.10.17.4) but the houseūholder's life is always preferred. In dharmasastra, there is the constant suggestion that only those unable to be householders (such as the crippled or impotent) should 'renounce' the houseūholder way (cf. Olivelle 1984:34). But before the widower may resume the householder's sacrificial duties, his patnī and the sacred fires associated with her must be burned up together, and replaced. It follows that a junior wife may never be cremated with the sacred fires while the patnī is still alive (Sm.C.II.p.440, Visnu; Mit. on Yājñ.1.89).

[[141]]

This link between the sacred fires and the patnī is not indissoluble. Yājñ.1.89 specifies that the wife cremated in this way should be wellūbehaved (vṛttavatī; glossed by Dev. and Mit. as ācāravati). Kātyā- yana spells out the proviso. The patni may only be cremated with the sacred fires if she has fulfilled her religious obligations and beūhaved virtuously (dharmacārini sadhvi). If she has been difficult (viparītā), then she should not be cremated in this way; and the husband should remarry anyway (Sm.C.II.p.441, Katy.). In fact, as the Trikāndamandana demonstrates, there were several views on this issue of when to reset the fires. According to Trik.III. 92, for example, a junior wife may not be cremated with the śrauta fires. According to Trik.III.94, any wife 'without distinction' (strīmātram aviseṣena) may be cremated with the śrauta fires. According to Trik.III.100-1, because of the primary importance (pradhānatvāt) of the husband and the obvious secondary imporūtance (sākṣād angatvāt; comm.) of the wife, her death has no effect at all (cf. comm. on Trik.II.8). 

According to the general consensus of opinion, however, if the patni is virtuous, she becomes identified with the sacred fires for the rest of her married life. So great is the identification that her presence at the sacrifice is more important than her husband's. Moreover, the fires and the ritual die with her, albeit temporarily. The widower is faced with three options. He may renounce the householder life. He may (as discussed briefly above, see pp.114- 15) rekindle the fires for himself alone (e.g. Trik.III.128), or with a 'substitute wife' made of kusa grass. Or, as most writers on dharmasastra prefer, he should rekindle the fires with a new patnī, thus symbolising the ritual beginning of a new life. The alternatives open to the widow on her husband's death are strikingly different. She may not rekindle the fires for herself alone, nor make a 'substitute husband' for ritual purposes; nor may she rekindle the fires with a new husband and embark upon a new ritual life. Instead, she should either die with her husband (sahagamana; see section IV, pp. 291–8), or live out her days in ascetic and celibate widowhood (vidhavādharma; see section IV, pp. 298-304). For only in her husūband's lifetime is her ritual (and social) status assured. 

Is the patni the ritual agent of the sacrifice? 

Given the identification of the patni with the sacred fires, and the 

[[142]]

importance of her presence at the sacrifice, should she be conūsidered the performer of the sacrifice? May she officiate in her husband's absence? According to Tryambaka, she may not. 

He discusses the śrauta ritual (agnihotrahome) first, beginning with two quotations attributed respectively to śruti and sūtra literaūture. They read as follows. First, 'therefore the sacrificial ritual of agnihotra involves one priest.'41 Secondly, 'he (the sacrificer) should perform the sacrifice himself on parvan days, and at other times one of the priests should do it.'42 As a result of these two rulings, as Tryambaka points out, 'in the case of the agnihotra oblation, there can be no assumption that the patnī is the agent (of the sacrifice) since the priest and the sacrificer are so defined.'43 

The parvan days are the 'junctures' of the month, the especially sacred times of the new and full moon (amāvāsyā and pūrṇimā; cf. comm. on Aśv.śr.II.4.2). The phrase 'one of the priests' (rtvijām eka[ḥ]) is a reference to the general rule that sacrificial rituals (yajñakratu) normally require four priests. Even soma sacrifices involving sixteen priests have four main ones with three assistants each (Āśv.śr.IV.1.6; Āp.śr.X.1.8-9). In the agnyādheya, darśaūpūrṇamāsa and other istis, only four are necessary: adhvaryu, āgnīdhra, hotṛ, and brahman; and all are given the general name of rtvij. Of these, only the adhvaryu is required for the agnihotra ritual. 

The word yajamāna is assumed without comment to denote the male sacrificer alone. Both the early acceptance of a 'sacrificing married couple' (vajamānadampatyoḥ; Say. on R.V.VIII.31.5) and the much-debated question of the modification (ūha) of gender (see section I, pp. 39-43) are long forgotten. 

Tryambaka next considers the aupāsana ritual. His evidence is a quotation from Āpastamba, again accorded the plural of respect (see pp. 135-6, note 34). ‘An offering is scorned (by the gods) if it is performed by a woman or an uninitiated person (anupetena), or if it is mixed with alkaline (kṣāra) or saline (lavaṇa) substances or with inferior food (avarānna).' Tryambaka concludes that, ac-

[[143]]

cording to this statement, ‘in the aupāsana oblation too, the agency of the patni is prohibited.'44 

The term upeta means literally 'one who has entered into or approached'; as in (a)vyañjanopeta, ‘a girl who has (or has not yet) reached puberty'. On its own, and in the context of dharmaśāstra, it invariably means 'one who has approached a teacher for initiation'. Strictly speaking, the term denotes a boy who has begun his studies but not yet completed them. For example, the rulings on food in the Apastambadharmasutra include the statement that an upeta should not eat the leftovers (ucchista; see section IIC, pp. 221-7) of women or an anupeta (Āp.II.4.9.7). The Ujjvalā glosses the former term as 'one who has undergone the initiation ceremony but who has not yet (completed his studies and) returned home' (kṛtopanayano 'samā- vṛttaḥ; Ujj. on Āp.II.4.9.7); that is, the brahmacarin. Since this is so (evam sati), the commentary continues, then one who has completed his studies and returned home (the snataka) incurs no such sin (samāvṛttasyocchiṣṭam bhuñjānasya na doṣaḥ syat; Ujj. on Āp.II. 4.9.7, Benares edn.). The distinction is an interesting one, as we shall see in Tryambaka's section on food (section IIC, pp. 210-33), and in particular, in the subsection concerning the wife's own meal (pp. 221-7). A similar distinction is implied in the Aśvalayanagṛhyaūsūtra. After a series of rulings relating to the Vedic student, Áśv. gr. 1.23.21 explains that they apply to a boy who has not been initiated before (ity anupetapūrvasya). The subsequent rules apply to one who has been initiated before (athopetapurvasya; Aśv.gr.1.23.22). Nārāyaṇa does not comment on either term, but it is clear that a person who has completed his Vedic studentship would not return to the teacher a second time: the term must thereūfore denote a drop-out from traditional Vedic education; that is, one who has been initiated but has failed to complete his studies as required. 

More frequently, however, the term is used as a synonym for upanīta (‘an initiated person'; cf. upetaḥ, Yājñ.III.2, upanītaḥ, Mit.; Karkopādhyāya, Jayarama, Harihara etc. on Par.gr.III.10.10) or upavīta (‘one invested with the sacred thread'); and the comple-

tion of Vedic studies is assumed. In its more common negative form (anupeta; glossed by Sudarsana on Ap.gr.III.8.3 as anupanīta, Benares edn.), it denotes either an adult male who is theoretically of the first three varnas but has never in fact been initiated; or a male child, born to parents of the first three varnas, who has not yet been initiated but will be. The first meaning is exemplified by Ap.I.1.1.32 which rules that if a man's father and grandfather were never initiated (yasya pitā pitāmaha ity anupetau), then both he and they are deemed to be 'brahmin-killers' (syātām te brahmahasamstutāḥ). Consequently, before such a person may be taught the Veda (Āp.I.1.2.4), he must recite certain mantras daily for a whole year for each uninitiated ancestor (pratipūruṣam samkhyāya samvatūsaran yāvanto 'nupetah syuh; Ap.I.1.2.1). In its original context, Tryambaka's quotation (Āp.gr.III.8.10.3; cf. the parallel rulings in Ap.II.6.15.14-15, 17-18) may be interpreted in either way. The issue is what renders a sacrifice invalid and, in particular, whether a woman or an uninitiated man (or boy) may officiate. The answer, for Apastamba as for Tryambaka, is that they may not (striyānuūpetena ... homam paricakṣate, Āp.gr. III.8.10.3; na strī juhuyāt| nānupetaḥ, Āp.II.6.15.17-18; cf. Manu II.171). It is clear from the context of Tryambaka's treatise that the ruling is given to counterūact the suggestion that, if a man is unable to perform the ritual, his wife or young son may do it for him (see below for a further disūcussion of temporary substitutes). 

Dharmasastra literature defines kṣāralavaṇa in a number of ways. The issue is usually raised either (as here) in relation to which foods may not be offered in a sacrifice (e.g. Ap.gr.III.8.3; Āp.II. 6.15.14); or in relation to which foods may not be eaten by indiūviduals in special categories, such as the (celibate) Vedic student (e.g. Āśv.gr.1.22.17; Āp.I.1.2.23; Hir.gr.1.8.2, but cf. v.9), the newly married (and therefore celibate) couple (e.g. Āśv.gṛ.1.8.10), or those engaged in the ritual period of mourning (and celibacy; e.g. Manu V.73). Kṣāra means literally 'sharp' or 'pungent'. It is defined by Haradatta as that which makes one's saliva flow (lālotpadyate; Ujj. on Ap.II.6.15.14). According to Nārāyaṇa's ⚫commentary on Aśv.gr.1.8.10, however, the term denotes certain types of pulse. For Mātṛdatta on Hir.gr.I.8.2 (p.108), it is molasses (guḍādir ikṣuvikāraḥ). For Sarvajñanārāyaṇa on Manu V.73, it is an alkaline substance (sarjikādi; carbonate of soda, Dutt 1922:

[[145]]

88). For Medhātithi on Manu V.73 and the Mitākṣarā on Yājñ. III.36, it is made from barley (yavakṣārādi; carbonate of potash, Dutt 1922:87). Kullūka on Manu V.73 takes kṣāralavana together as a karmadhāraya compound meaning ‘manufactured (as opposed to natural) salt' (kṛtrimalavana). In the context of ayurveda, Suśruta distinguishes five categories of kṣāra including yavakṣāra and sarjikākṣāra mentioned above (Meulenbeld 1974:459; Dutt 1922: 21-2, 81-2, 87-8). Ayurveda also distinguishes several kinds of lavana including rock salt (saindhava; Medh. on Manu V.73) and sun-dried sea salt (sāmudra; Meulenbeld 1974:495–6). 

The term avarānna (‘inferior food') denotes food made from pulses or split peas (kośīdhānyāni māṣādīni kṛṣṇadhānyāni... etc.; Har. on Ap.gr., Benares edn.). It may be contrasted with 'superior food' made from rice boiled in milk and sugar (paramānna; Meulenūbeld 1974:471-2). For a discussion of the occurrence of the term avarānna in dharmasastra and ayurveda, see Gode 1956:153-60. 

The same issue concerning the ritual agency of the patni reaches a different conclusion in the Smrticandrikā. The ruling under disūcussion there is Manu's statement that only one who is skilled in vaitāna (śrauta) rites and who has mastered the Veda may offer oblation. Those who do not qualify include the uninitiated, the fool, the man of little learning, and women (Manu XI.36–7). Manu's reference to a girl or young woman (naiva kanyā na yuvatir) is taken by Devannabhatta to include the patni (kanyāgrahaṇam patnya api pradarśanārtham; Sm.C.II.p.424). More important, Devannabhatta insists that the word agnihotra indicates that only the śrauta ritual is meant (tac chrautāgniviṣayam agnihotragrahaṇāt). He concludes with Gobhila (see note 48 below) that the patnī may if she likes (kāmam) make the morning and evening offerings (sāyamprātarhomau) into the aupāsana fire (gṛhyāgnau; Sm.C.II. 

p.424). 

In fact, Tryambaka too admits that 'the agency of the patni is accepted by some.'45 He quotes from six different authorities. According to Aśvalayana, 'one should perform the household ritual (grhyam for gṛhyāgnim) oneself from the time of marriage onwards (pāṇigrahaṇādi; glossed by Nār. as pāṇigrahaṇaprabhṛti); or one's patni, son, unmarried daughter (kumāri) or 'live-in pupil' 

[^45]: anyais tu patnyāḥ kartrtvam angīkṛtam // Sdhp.9v.8-9. 

 

[[146]]

(antevāsī; glossed as sisyaḥ, Nār., Dev.) (should do it).’46 

The reference to the son implies a temporary substitute, for the man who hands over his ritual responsibilities to his son on a perūmanent basis is held to have left the householder stage for the life of the hermit or renunciate. Kumārī denotes an unmarried daughter. In the context of the four ages of a woman, the term denotes a girl past puberty, who has left childhood (bālya) behind and is in the three-year (or three-month) period of adolescence during which a husband must be found (kaumāra, hence kaumārī). She has not yet reached the third stage (yauvana); for by then she should be married, and a married woman owes allegiance only to her husband and to the sacrifices pertaining to his household (see above, pp. 86-8). Two points should be noted here. First, the general tone of Tryambaka's treatise, combined with his insistence that a girl's fertile periods (ṛtu) should not be neglected (see section IV, pp. 287– 8) suggests that Tryambaka, like most later nibandhakāras, advoūcates prepubertal marriages for girls (cf. the discussion of nagnikā above, pp. 86-8). Such a view would not permit an adolescent girl to be still unmarried and in her father's house, and so able to take over his sacrificial duties. It is surprising that Tryambaka has not followed the example of the Smṛtimuktaphala and changed kumary to kuryād (Sm.M.II.p.355). As it stands, Āśvalāyana's ruling does not accord with the rest of Tryambaka's views. 

Secondly, the reference to kumārī in this context carries with it the assumption that the man in question has no son to act as temūporary substitute. This in turn recalls the concept of the putrikā. If a man has no sons then, for religious purposes, he may 'reclassify' his daughter as a son. Both she and later her son will then perform the necessary funeral rites for her father. She may also inherit her father's property in the place of a real son (Manu IX.130). In Vasistha's list of the twelve kinds of sons deemed acceptable by the ancient seers, the 'appointed daughter' or putrikā is listed third (Vas.XVII.15). A parallel list in the Visnusmrti puts the son of such a daughter third (putrikāputra; Viṣ.Sm.XV.4). The rite of 'reclassūification' takes place during the marriage ceremony when the bride's

father lays formal claim to his daughter's son (Vis.Sm.XV.5). By extension, any girl who has no brother, and who thus might be called upon to perform this duty, is called a putrikā (Viṣ.Sm.XV.6). Hence Manu's warning that a wise man should not marry a girl who has no brother (Manu III.11; Yājñ.I.53), for then his own funeral rites and those of his ancestors will be neglected. While Būhler produces both historical and contemporary evidence for the practice (1965:85–6, note 15), according to Kane it has been out of vogue for centuries (PVK II.1.p.435). We may assume that it is very rarely, if ever, encountered nowadays. In Tryambaka's case, it is a further deūmonstration of the problem of quoting ancient texts to support an eighteenth-century point. 

Tryambaka continues. According to Vyasa, ‘a priest, (the householder's) son, patnī, pupil or, if he first obtains special permisūsion, his brother (sahodaraḥ) may offer sacrifice (in place of the householder) according to the usual rules.’47 

Sahodara means literally 'co-uterine', thus a brother born of the same mother. In the polygamous household envisaged by Tryamūbaka, a man might have several half-brothers born of his father's different wives; these are excluded by Vyasa's ruling. We may also note that, unlike Aśvalāyana, Vyasa excludes the unmarried daughter too. 

According to Gobhila, ‘the patni should offer the two oblations of morning and evening into the domestic fire. '48 The reference to a single fire indicates that the aupāsana ritual is under discussion here, not the śrauta. Alternatively, according to Bhāradvāja, 'the wife may offer sacrifice, but without reciting the mantras.'49

[[148]]

According to Gautama, 'some people (eke) maintain that the patnī may offer sacrifice.'50 

Tryambaka concludes his case for the agency of the patni with two slokas from the Smṛtyarthasara. 'With regard to oblations, the sacrificer is the most important (i.e. the first choice); (failing him) his patni, son, unmarried daughter (kanyakā), priest (i.e. one employed by him), pupil, teacher, brother (bhrātṛ), sister's son or daughter's husband (may take his place). An oblation offered by any of these (people, i.e. on his behalf) is (held to have been) made by him alone. The patni and the unmarried daughter should perform the sacrifice without the act of sprinkling (water round the hearth).'51 

This is the most extensive of all the lists of substitute officiants. It includes the unmarried daughter, extends the notion of brother to include half-brother, and adds two more: sister's son and daughter's husband. We may assume that the wife and daughter are advised to omit the act of sprinkling water round the hearth on the grounds that it involves the recitation of Vedic mantras. In that case, however, it is not clear why the prohibition on reciting manūtras is not made explicit and extended to cover the entire ritual (as in the Bhāradvāja ruling). 

But perhaps the most important statement is that the sacrifice is always deemed to have been offered by the householder regardless of who actually officiates. The term yajamāna (‘sacrificer') exclusively denotes the male head of the household, on whom all ritual resūponsibility rests whether he is physically present or not. Even when the wife is permitted to officiate, she never earns the title of 'sacriūficer', not even temporarily. When her husband is present, she is his assistant; when he is absent, she may-according to some authoūrities - be his representative. But she may never perform a sacrifice herself.

Cf. Par.M.I.i.p.311 (Dakṣa).

[[149]]

Tryambaka's own views are clear. The male head of the houseūhold should always perform the śrauta sacrifice himself. If possible, he should perform the aupasana ritual himself too; if not, there is scriptural justification for the practice of using permitted substiūtutes, including the patni. Tryambaka's reluctance to allow this even in the case of the smārta ritual may be explained by the belief that a sacrifice performed by a substitute officiant produces a substandard result. According to Dakṣa, for example, the reward obtained by an oblation offered oneself (svayamhomaphalam) cannot be obtained by. proxy (Sm.C.II.p.422). For when a ritual is performed by someone else, the 'unseen result' (phalam adṛṣṭam) is halved (phalam ardham, Sm.C.II.p.422-3; cf. Sm.M.II.p.354-5; Par.M.I.i.p.311). But if the absence of the true sacrificer is unavoidable, a substitute or reūpresentative may be assigned as detailed above. As Devannaūbhatta explains, these qualifications only apply when the sacrificer cannot perform the ritual himself (svayamhomālābhaviṣayam), because that alone is praised (tasyaiva prasastatvāt; Sm.C.II.p.423). These rulings concerning substitute officiants must presumably be taken in conjunction with Tryambaka's earlier statement that a 'priest and so on' (rtvigādinā) should not perform the sacrifice in the absence of both husband and wife (see p. 132, note 29). Since only the husband may journey away from home, the implication is that, whoever is appointed to officiate in his absence, the patnī must still be there. 

The offering of respect to the sun (arghyadānam) 

The wife's final dawn duty, as described by Tryambaka, is that of offering worship to the rising sun. He explains. 'As soon as the oblation (homa) has been offered, the wife (striyā) should perform the (ritual of) presenting an offering of respect (arghyadānam) to the sun.'52 

The first point to note here is that, since Tryambaka seems to be concerned primarily with wives who assist at the śrauta ritual of agnihotra and only secondarily with those whose husbands perform the aupāsanahoma, the samdhyā ritual may be performed in the home rather than in a solitary or sacred place outside the village (see above pp. 105-6). It thus makes sense that the rulings on arghyadānam 

[^52]: homānantaram striyā sūryāyārghyadānam kartavyam // Sdhp.10r.6. 

 

[[150]]

are simply added on to those concerning the fire ritual, without any reference to the proper setting for their performance. 

Secondly, why does Tryambaka fail to give any rulings concerning the other actions normally associated with the samdhyā ritual: that is, the recitation of mantras (japa), sipping (ācamana), ritual breathūing (prāṇāyāma), sprinkling with water (mārjana), the ritual for driving out sin (aghamarṣana), the worship of the appropriate deity (upasthāna) and so on (e.g. PVK.II.i.p.315–19; Vidyāmṇava 1979; 32 ff.? Perhaps the answer is to be found in the earliest references to samdhyā. It seems that the oldest forms of the ritual involve only or principally two actions: offering water to the sun (arghya) and the recitation (japa) of the gãyatrī or sāvitrī mantra (PVK II.i.p.314). According to Tait.Ar.II.2, for example, brahmavādins face east and throw upwards water that has been consecrated by the gāyatrī (samdhyāyām gāyatriyābhimantritā apa urdhvam vikṣipanti; p.121). Both the Asvalayanaūand the Śānkhāyanagṛhyasūtra mention only the japa recitation (sāvitrīm japet, Aśv.gr.III.7.4; Śānkh.gr.II.9.2). Mān.gr.I.2.2 mentions only the offering of water to the sun (añjalīm pūrayitva) and the gayatri. Not until the Baudhāyanadharmasūtra do we find any reference to the other elements associated with the ritual: bathing, sipping, sprinkling water (mantravat prokṣaṇam), japa recitation (sāvitrīm āvartayet), ritual breathing with mantras, and devotion to Varuna or Mitra (Baudh.II.4.7.1-11). Tryambaka is thus an exponent both of the more complex srauta ritual of agniūhotra and the more rudimentary form of samdhyā. There are two possible reasons for this. The more rudimentary ritual in accordance with earlier rather than later texts may be a mark of his extreme orthodoxy. Alternatively, and to my mind more probably, he gives us a truncated form of the ritual precisely because it is intended for women. As described, the ritual is in fact more like the various kinds of devotional worship performed by women all over India today. 

Tryambaka's omission of the japa recitation is predictable. For only twice-born males may recite Vedic mantras. As Baudhāyana explains in relation to another aspect of the samdhyā ritual, bathing is open to all varṇas but sprinkling water over oneself while reciting mantras (mantravat prokṣaṇam) is restricted to the twice-born (Baudh.II.4.7.3); that is, according to the later understanding of the term, to the initiated male. In fact, in section IV of Tryambaka's treatise, japa meditation is included among the six things that cause

[[151]]

a woman to 'fall' and which must therefore be avoided at all costs. (see pp. 274-6). Yet, according to Vidyarnava, this is the 'absolutely necessary' part of Hindu prayer: 'everyone, who calls himself a Hindu' should recite it (1979:33). Unfortunately, Vidyārṇava gives little thought to the part played by women in his scheme of Hindu devotional prayer. As his detailed account demonstrates, each part of the samdhyā ritual must be accompanied by a number of mantras. If women are unable to pronounce these mantras, then as Tryamūbaka implies, much of the ritual is barred to them. 

Tryambaka's first point is to stress the importance of the ritual in terms of the future fortunes of the wife. According to Vyasa, 'the woman who presents an offering of respect to the sun in the early morning will not experience widowhood in her next seven lives. '53 The description of how she should perform the ritual (tat prakāram) is also attributed to Vyasa. 'The gods are pleased with the woman who constantly makes a circle (maṇḍalakam; i.e. of powder) outside (the house) and offers silent worship with unbroken rice and so on.'54 

The 'circle (of powder)' recalls the rangavalya patterns described in the section on threshold worship (pp. 63-4). 'Silent worship' (tūṣ- nīm pūjayet) indicates that the wife should perform the ritual without the recitation of (Vedic) mantras. ‘Unbroken rice and so on' implies an offering of such things as unbroken rice, sacred grass, flowers, sandalwood paste and, presumably, water. 

There is an explicit if confusing analogy here between the ritual of showing respect to the sun and that of showing respect to an imūportant human guest such as an officiating priest, a learned teacher, a bridegroom or a king (ṣadarghyārhā[h], Mãn.gr.I.9.1; Aśv.gr.I.24. 1–4; Yājñ.I.111; cf. Gonda 1980:385-6). Indeed, as Kaus. Br.II.8.4 explains, he who offers sacrifice at sunrise is in fact offering hospitaūlity (ātithyam karoti) to a great god starting on a journey. The ritual of respectfully offering water (arghya) is one of the principal comūponents of the proper welcome of the guest in the madhuparka 

[^53]: tatha ca vyāsaḥ // prātaḥkāle tu yā nārī dadyād arghyam vivasvate / saptajanmasu vaidhavyam sā nārī naiva paśyati // Sdhp.10r.6-7 (Vyāsa) < Sm.M.I.p.158 (saptajanmani for saptajanmasu; Vyāsa).

[[152]]

ceremony described at some length in the gṛhyasūtras. The term madhuparka denotes an offering of honey or clarified butter and curds (Āśv.gr.1.24.5-6; Ap.gr.V.13.10; Hir.gr.I.12.11-12; PVK II.i.p.542ff.). The other items offered to the special guest include a seat of grass, a cow, and water intended for three distinct purposes: for washing the feet, as an offering of respect, and for sipping (pādyārtham arghyārtham ācamanārtham codakam; Nār. on Aśv. gr.I.24.7). When the guest has washed his feet, he receives the arghya water in cupped hands (arghyam añjalinā pratigṛhya ; Āsv.gr.I.24.11). Nārāyaṇa's comment provides the traditional definition of the term: water mixed with such things as perfume (e.g. sandalwood paste) and flowers (gandhamālyādisamyuktam udakam). 

If we turn to arghyadāna as a subsidiary component of the samdhyā ritual, we find that the offering of respect to the sun also consists of water. Par.M.I.i.p.295, for example, explains that after the ritual of sprinkling (mārjana) one should offer arghya to the sun. According to Vyasa, this consists of taking in one's two hands (karābhyām) water that has been consecrated by mantras (toyam 

gāyatryā cābhimantritam) and throwing it up three times in the direction of the sun (Par.M.I.i.p.296; Sm.C.II.p.362). The disūcussion continues with a number of similar quotations also enūjoining an offering to the sun consecrated by mantras (e.g. sāvitryābhimantritam udakam, Hārīta; Par.M.I.i.p.296; Sm.C.II. p.362). In view of the references to the gayatri mantra, it is hardly surprising that Tryambaka does not produce any of these quotaūtions to describe the arghyadāna ritual as performed by women. 

What is surprising, however, is that the offering of water has been replaced by a powder design and an offering of 'unbroken rice and so on'. In fact, the ritual hinted at by Tryambaka seems closer to the contemporary worship of images (devapijā) than to the traditūional ritual of samdhya. The offering of arghya water is certainly mentioned in one of the earliest descriptions of the devapūjā (Vis.Sm.65.3). In later accounts, however, arghyadāna consists of offering water mixed with all kinds of things such as rice, curds, kusa grass, milk, dūrvā grass, honey, grains of barley and so on (e.g. Matsy. P.267.2) The samdhyā ritual described in the Agnipurāna differentiates between the arghya offering made to the sun and that made to Śiva: the former consists of water accompanied by mantras (Ag.P.73.15); the latter is mixed with kusa grass, flowers and un-

[[153]]

broken rice (kusapuṣpākṣatānvitam) accompanied by the gayatri (Ag.P.72.38). Since the Agnipurāṇa also stipulates that women may not recite Vedic mantras (153.12), the latter ritual, if not both, would seem to be barred to women. In the 'special arghya' ritual described by Vidyārṇava in his section on pūjā, the water is mixed with unbroken rice, sandalwood paste and flowers (1979:149-50). 

Tryambaka's next quotation, attributed to Madhava's comūmentary on the Parāśarasmṛti, is predictably not taken from the latter's section on arghyadāna (Par.M.I.i.p.295-6). For, as noted above, arghya is there defined as water consecrated with Vedic mantras. The quotation comes instead from the end of Madhava's section on tarpaṇa (the ritual of offering water to gods, sages and ancestors; Par.M.I.i.p.364). As Mādhava explains, after performing the various kinds of tarpana, one should sip water and then make an offering of water in cupped hands to the sun (dadyāt sūryāya saliūlāñjalim, Par.M.I.i.p.364; Vis.P.III.11.39a). Then follows the invocation to the sun selected by Tryambaka for the wife to declaim as she makes her arghya offering. It is taken from Aurva's discourse to Sagara on the 'fixed observances' (sadācāra) of the householder in the Visnupurāṇa and reads as follows. ‘Hail to the sun god, Brahman, radiant one, who has the fiery energy of Visnu, purifier of the world, the pure, the enlivener, who prods (us) to ritual action.'55 Śrīdharasvāmin glosses jagatsavitre as 'generating all' (viśvajanaūkāya), karmadayine as 'precipitating ritual action' (karmapraūvarttakāya). Unlike Tryambaka, neither Madhava nor Śrīdharaūsvāmin (nor indeed Aurva) links this invocation with women. In fact, there are only two references to the special obligations of women in Aurva's entire discourse: according to the first, the wife should perform the vaiśvadeva ritual; according to the second, the householder should approach his wife for sexual intercourse in the evening as long as she is not sick, pregnant or menstruating. 

The invocation to the sun evidently constitutes an exception to or modification of the rule already given that women should perform the arghya ritual without reciting mantras (tūṣṇīm eva; see note 54).

[[154]]

Presumably, this is because the strict prohibition applies only to Vedic mantras, whereas this one comes from a purāna. It is certainly not to be found in Bloomfield's concordance of Vedic mantras (1964(2)). Yet this mantra is included by Vidyārṇava in the samdhyā rituals of orthodox males of two of the main Vedic schools (śākhā). Of the eighteen subdivisions of the Vedic samdhyā ritual outlined by Vidyāmava, six are devoted to the sun: an offering of water to greet the sun (sūryārgha); the worship of the sun (sūryopasthāna); a fareūwell offering of water (suryārghya); obeisance to the sun (suryaūnamaskāra); a third offering of water (sūryārghya); and a final salutation (suryapraṇāma). Each of these, accompanied by mantras, is repeated three times a day. According to Vidyārṇava, the mantra specified by Tryambaka for women is recited by brahmins of the Rgvedic school during the third offering of water to the sun (1979:66). In the slightly different order of the Samavedic school, the same mantra is recited during the arghya offering to the sun at the end of the worship of Rudra (1979:89). It is curious that Vidyar- ṇava makes so much of the difficulties of pronouncing the Vedic language and thus of the need to bar the uneducated masses from performing these rituals (e.g. 1979:113) if some of the mantras cited are in fact purāṇic. Yet this particular mantra figures neither in the tantric version of the ritual developed precisely for the exūexcluded majority nor in the 'universal' ritual intended for ‘all mankind, irrespective of colour, caste, creed, race, sex, or nationaliūty' (Vidyarṇava 1979:113-19, 119-28). 

Tryambaka's final quotation in this section is attributed to the Agnipurāna. 'The chaste wife (sati) pays homage to the radiant one to ensure the long life and good health of her husband; she who desires the bliss of married life (saumangalyam) should bow down before brahmins. '56 Thus, while a man might be encouraged to worship the sun in order to ensure the dawning of a new day, or to gain 'unseen' merit, his wife's reward is seen in terms of the surūvival and vigour of her husband. While he might be more impressed by talk of heaven or the rewards of the next life, she is coaxed into correct behaviour by the promise of saumangalya, the 'bliss of married life'. This contrast in the parallel rulings for husband and wife is typical.

This quotation brings to a close Tryambaka's comments on the dawn duties of the wife. I have dealt with this section in some detail for two reasons. First, it presents the wife's religious role in the narūrower sense of her ritual obligations. Secondly, it demonstrates most clearly the odd mixture so typical of medieval texts: the signiūficance of the wife in symbolic terms coupled with her unimportance in ritual actions.
