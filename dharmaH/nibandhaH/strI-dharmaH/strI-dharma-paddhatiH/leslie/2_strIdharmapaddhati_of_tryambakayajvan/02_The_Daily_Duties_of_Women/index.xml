      <description>&lt;p&gt;IIA Before Dawn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Sdhp. 2v.5-7v.9)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I shall begin by taking, out of sequence, the rulings relating to the time of waking (prabodhanam; Sdhp.2v.5-3r.3). As Tryambaka explains, &amp;lsquo;both householder and wife should already be awake (i.e. have risen) in the final or sixth division of the night (4.00-6.00 a.m.).&amp;lsquo;1 ‘According to the Smṛtiratnāvalī, it is wrong to be asleep (or in bed) after the brahmamuhūrta: if a married couple stays in bed in the brahmamuhurta, their house is like a cremation ground, shunned by the (spirits of) the ancestors.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IIB At Dawn&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Sdhp. 7v.9-10v.1)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Serving the sacred fire (agniśuśrūṣā; Sdhp. 7v.9-10r.6)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The word suśruṣā is well chosen. In this context, it is a general term denoting the practical aspects of the fire sacrifice. It thus covers both the śrauta and grhya rituals detailed below. Secondly, it carries with it all the associations of religious service and devotion. For example, the brahmin who chooses to be a perpetual student is instructed to &amp;lsquo;serve&amp;rsquo; his teacher diligently all his life (paricaret, Manu II.243; glossed by Sarv. as suśruṣet). If his teacher dies, then he should &amp;lsquo;serve&amp;rsquo; his teacher&amp;rsquo;s son, his widow or sapinda relation (Manu II.247; guruvac chuśrūṣām anutiṣṭhet, Kull.). If none of these are alive, he should spend the rest of his life &amp;lsquo;serving&amp;rsquo; the sacred fire (agniśuśruṣā; Manu II.248). Thirdly, the term reinforces the associations of obedience, subservience and attentiveness suggested by bhartṛ- śuśrūṣā (&amp;lsquo;serving one&amp;rsquo;s husband&amp;rsquo;), already established as the single most important goal for women (see Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s introduction, section I, pp. 29–43). These ideas are further explained in Tryambaka&amp;rsquo;s detailed definition of the term in his conclusion (section V, especially pp. 312–13).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>03 Day</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IIC Day&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Sdhp. 10v.1-19v.4)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saluting one&amp;rsquo;s elders (gurūṇām abhivādanam; Sdhp.10v.111r. 10).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wife&amp;rsquo;s first duty after she has made her dawn offering to the sun (tadanantaram) is ‘to salute those to whom she owes respect (gurūṇām), using her ordinary name (abhivādanam).&amp;quot; Three points may be noted here. First, the formal salutation described is always made by an inferior to his or her superior. In the case of the wife, then, the action reinforces the family hierarchy each day. Secondly, the recipient&amp;rsquo;s equally formal response is to bestow a blessing. This constitutes a validation in religious terms of the wife&amp;rsquo;s homage. Thirdly, this is another case of a ruling usually made for men being applied to women (cf. Yājñ.I.26).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;IID Evening (Sdhp. 19v.4-21r.3)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The considerably shorter section relating to the wife&amp;rsquo;s duties in the evening may be divided into two main groups. First, Tryambaka deals briefly with the evening equivalents of morning rituals and tasks: the evening agnihotra, paying respect to one&amp;rsquo;s elders, the vaiśvadeva ritual and bali offerings, paying homage to guests, and the evening meal (Sdhp.19v.4-20r.4). Secondly, he gives several rulings regarding sexual intercourse at night (sayanam; Sdhp. 20r.4-21r.2).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
