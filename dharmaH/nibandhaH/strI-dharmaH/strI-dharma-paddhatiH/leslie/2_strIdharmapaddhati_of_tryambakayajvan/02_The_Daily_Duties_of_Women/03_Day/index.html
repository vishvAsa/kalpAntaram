  <p>IIC Day</p>
<p>(Sdhp. 10v.1-19v.4)</p>
<p>Saluting one&rsquo;s elders (gurūṇām abhivādanam; Sdhp.10v.111r. 10).</p>
<p>The wife&rsquo;s first duty after she has made her dawn offering to the sun (tadanantaram) is ‘to salute those to whom she owes respect (gurūṇām), using her ordinary name (abhivādanam).&quot; Three points may be noted here. First, the formal salutation described is always made by an inferior to his or her superior. In the case of the wife, then, the action reinforces the family hierarchy each day. Secondly, the recipient&rsquo;s equally formal response is to bestow a blessing. This constitutes a validation in religious terms of the wife&rsquo;s homage. Thirdly, this is another case of a ruling usually made for men being applied to women (cf. Yājñ.I.26).</p>
<p>The word guru in such contexts is usually a general term denoting anyone to whom an individual should show respect. For a man, the most important (atiguru) are father, mother and religious teacher (ācārya). These three are said to be equal to the three Vedas, the three great gods, the three worlds, and the three srauta fires (Vis. Sm.31.1-2,7; cf. Ap.I.4.14.6; Mbh.III.204.17-26). After these, respect is accorded to a man&rsquo;s senior relatives (e.g. uncles, grandfathers, fathers-in-law, eldest brother, and their wives, Vis.Sm.32. 1-2; and older female relatives, Sm.C.I.89-90); to those of his teacher (Vis.Sm.32.5,14-15; Manu II.207); and to his &rsquo;elders&rsquo; in general (vṛddha, Manu II.120) and presumably their wives too.</p>
<p>Thus men are treated with the respect due to their own age and status; women according to that due to their husbands (pativayasaḥ striyah, Āp.I.4.14.21 and Har.; Vas.XIII.42). Although Vis.Sm.32.2 specifies here the wife of the same varṇa (see above; cf. Manu II.210), for most authorities the identification of wife with husband supersedes any theoretical difference of varna. For, as Manu explains, even a woman of low birth merges with the man she marries as a river merges with the ocean (samudreṇaiva nimnagā), thus developing the same qualities and becoming worthy of the same</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[157]]</p>
<p>honour (jagāmābhyarhaṇīyatām; Manu IX.22-4; cf. sections I, pp.34-9, and IIC, pp.221–7).</p>
<p>Although the point is never stressed in dharmasastra, the word guru denotes a completely different set of relationships for women. &lsquo;Father&rsquo; is replaced by &lsquo;husband&rsquo;s father&rsquo;, &lsquo;mother&rsquo; by &lsquo;husband&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;, and &rsquo;teacher&rsquo; by &lsquo;husband&rsquo;. The difference demonstrates both the complete identification of the wife with her husband and her spiritual tutelage by him on her ordained religious path. The subsidiary groups of people to whom respect should be shown are correspondingly different: the husband&rsquo;s senior relatives rather than her own, and those of her husband&rsquo;s teacher. In this section, however, Tryambaka is concerned primarily with the first triad, consisting of parents-in-law and husband.</p>
<p>The term abhivādana must be distinguished from several other kinds of greetings and salutations: namaskāra, pratyutthāna, upasamgrahana and pratyabhivāda.</p>
<p>Namaskāra denotes the action of bowing with one&rsquo;s hands together in a gesture of respect (añjali). According to the Smrtyarthasāra, this is normally done towards images of deities (devatāpratimā), or illustrious individuals such as ascetics (yati) or renouncers (e.g. tridandin;Sm.A.p.8). Namaskāra may also be &lsquo;five-&rsquo; or &rsquo;eight-limbed&rsquo; (pañcānga or astanga) depending on the degree of prostration (Vir.P.p.88; Sm.M.II.p.389; cf. also suryanamaskāra, prostration to the sun). According to the Smṛticandrika, one should only perform namaskāra in public assemblies, in sacrifices, or in palaces and royal courts (Sm.C.I.p.102; Visnu). Tryambaka, however, uses the term to describe the proper mode of respect owed by the wife to her husband in the home (see below, pp.162-3).</p>
<p>Pratyutthāna denotes the action of rising respectfully from one&rsquo;s seat in order to receive someone. Certain individuals who do not merit the degree of respect implied by abhivadana or upasamgrahaṇa may be accorded this simpler gesture. For example, Baudhāyana rules that if an officiating priest (ṛtvik), father-in-law or uncle is younger than oneself, then one need only rise from one&rsquo;s seat and address him (pratyutthāyābhāṣaṇam, Baudh.I.2.3.45; pratyutthānamātreṇa pūjā, Har. on Gaut.VI.9). Gautama includes any aged person in this category, even a sudra (Gaut.VI.10). Pratyutthāna also precedes both upasamgrahana and abhivādana.</p>
<p>Upasamgrahana is the salutation implying the greatest respect.</p>
<p>[[158]]</p>
<p>For example, it is the appropriate greeting for one&rsquo;s own teacher when one goes to him for instruction (Āp.I.2.5.18) and, according to some authorities, for one&rsquo;s parents and senior relatives (e.g. Gaut.1.6.1-3). The Smṛtyarthasara (p. 7) defines upasamgrahana as announcing one&rsquo;s gotra and name (amukagotro devadattaśarmā) and making a formal salutation (aham bho abhivadaye) while touching one&rsquo;s ears (karnau spṛṣṭvā), bending one&rsquo;s head (sirovanamanam) and clasping the person&rsquo;s feet, the right hand holding the right foot, the left hand the left foot (cf. Vis.Sm.28.15–16).</p>
<p>Abhivādana consists of the same formal salutation and bending the head in respect, but omits the clasping of the person&rsquo;s feet with one&rsquo;s hands (abhivādane pādasamgrahaṇam nāsti; Sm.A.p.7). But it may include touching the person&rsquo;s feet (pādasparśanam kāryam na vā; Sm.A.p.7). In this way, for example, the student should greet his teacher early each morning (Āp.I.2.5.12). Abhivādana is also the usual form of salutation offered by an inferior to his superior. To ensure the correct degree of inclination, Āp.I.2.5.16 rules that the brahmin should make his salute while holding his right arm level with his ear (śrotrasamam); the kṣatriya with his chest (uraḥsamam); the vaisya with his waist (madhyasamam; glossed by Har. as udarasamam or alternatively ūrusamam, that is, level with his stomach or thighs); and the sudra by holding his arm out low (nīcaiḥ; glossed by Har. as pādasamam, level with his feet; cf. Sm.C.I.p.96). There is no ruling for women but perhaps we may assume that they would again be grouped with the sūdra. Manu II.120 explains the need to perform this ritual greeting. When an elder (sthavira) approaches a younger person (yuna), the latter&rsquo;s vital breaths (prānā[h]) rise upwards (utkrāmanti), desiring to leave the body (dehad bahir nirgantum icchanti; Medh.); but by rising from one&rsquo;s seat and making a formal salutation (pratyutthānābhivādābhyām) one can reclaim them once more. If we relate the ruling to women, however, we should substitute &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; for &lsquo;younger&rsquo; and &lsquo;superior&rsquo; for &lsquo;older&rsquo; for, as noted above, the age of the woman herself is immaterial.</p>
<p>This formal greeting may be performed as a daily (nitya) ritual (e.g. Āp.1.2.5.12-13), or as an occasional (naimittika) ritual (e.g. when returning from a journey, Āp.I.2.5.14), or in order to attain certain results (kāmya) such as heaven and long life (Āp.I.2.5.15; Manu II.121). Tryambaka&rsquo;s primary concern here is with the obligatory daily ritual to be performed by the wife after the dawn</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>observances and before the practical tasks of the morning.</p>
<p>[[159]]</p>
<p>When a brahmin greets his elder or superior, the traditional salutation is in three parts: the formal &lsquo;I salute&rsquo; (abhivādaye); the declaration of one&rsquo;s name; and the respectful vocative bhoḥ (Manu II. 122-4; Viṣ.Sm.28.17; Gaut.I.6.5). However, if the recipient is an ignorant man, that is, one who does not understand the salutation (Manu II.123), then it is abbreviated. In that case, the speaker should omit both the respectful bhoḥ and his name, saying only &lsquo;It is I&rsquo; (aham iti brūyāt; Manu II. 123). We have already noted that women are to be accorded the status and respect due to their husbands. In this context, however, Manu groups all women together with ignorant men (Manu II.123). Āpastamba even rules that a brahmin greeting either a kṣatriya, vaiśya or a woman should use the pronoun instead of his own name (sarvanāmnā&hellip; na nāmnā; Ap. 1.4.14.23). The Smṛticandrikā lists the purificatory rituals appropriate for a brahmin who gives a ritual greeting to a kṣatriya, vaisya or sudra (Sm.C.I.p.101-2); a woman is presumably an unworthy recipient too.</p>
<p>A similar distinction occurs in the rulings concerning the equally formal reply to such a salutation (pratyabhivāda). The rules governing this reply may be found in Panini&rsquo;s section on vowels lengthened to three moras (pluta). When the salutation made by a non-sudra is returned, the final vowel in the name given at the end of that reply is pluta (pratyabhivāde &lsquo;sūdre, Pan. VIII.2.83; cf. Manu II.125-6; Har. on Gaut.1.6.5). It follows by Paninian convention that if a sudra makes the salutation, the name given in the formal reply is not lengthened in this way. Patañjali interprets the reference to the śūdra to include women and those who behave in a disrespectful way (aśūdrastryasuyakeṣv iti vaktavyam) and applies it optionally to kṣatriyas and vaiśyas (Pat. on Pan.VIII.2.83, p.416). Thus the reply to a formal salutation from Gārgi is: ayuṣmati bhava gārgi (without the pluta lengthening).</p>
<p>Patanjali provides an interesting footnote. One of his arguments for the importance of the study of vyākaraṇa includes a sloka to the following effect: if one does not know the proper response to a salutation (the rules of pluta), then one is in danger of being saluted with the form used for women (cf. Manu II.123 above); to avoid this, one should learn one&rsquo;s grammar (abhivāde strīvan mā bhūmety adhyeyam vyākaraṇam; Pat. on Pan.I.1.1., p. 3). The same śloka is quoted by, among others, Medhātithi (on Manu II.123) and</p>
<p>[[160]]</p>
<p>Haradatta (on Gaut.I.6.5), thus demonstrating that this point was taken seriously in dharmasastra too. Manu II.126 adds that a brahmin who does not know the rules of pratyabhivāda is to be treated as a sudra and not saluted at all.</p>
<p>From the earliest times, an individual was given three or even four names. Sāyaṇa&rsquo;s classification (on R.V.VIII.80.9), for example, consists of a name derived from the nakṣatra on which one was born (nakṣatranāma), a secret name (guhyam nāma), a name known and used publicly (prakāśam nāma), and a fourth name derived from the performance of a sacrifice (turīyam nāma yajñiyam, R.V.VIII.80. 9; somayājīti, Say.). The appellation yajvan of &lsquo;Tryambakayajvan&rsquo; belongs to this fourth category.</p>
<p>The two names that concern us here are the ordinary name, usually termed vyāvahārika (or vyavahāropayuktanāma, as here), and the secret name (guhyam; e.g. Gobh.gr.II.7.15-16; Hir.gr.II.4.13), termed abhivādanīya (e.g. Āśv.gṛ.I.15.10). The former is self-explanatory: it is the name by which a person is generally known. According to the elaborate rules set out in Aśv.gr.I.15.4-9, the ordinary name for a boy should have two or four syllables, and should begin with a sonant and end with a visarga; while that for a girl should have an uneven number of syllables (three according to Mān.gr.I.18.1; see Manu II.33 for further rules regarding girls&rsquo; names). This is the name bestowed on a child in the naming ceremony (nāmakaraṇa) that takes place on the tenth or twelfth day after birth (Ap.gr.VI.15.8-11; Baudh.gr.II.1.23ff.; Manu II.30). The issue is seriously confused, however, by the fact that similar elaborate rules set out in Sankh.gr.I.24.4-5 apply to the (secret) name given at birth. Verse 6 explains that the ordinary name is given later, on the tenth day.</p>
<p>But both texts agree that the secret name (abhivādanīya; Āśv.gṛ. 1.15.10) is known only to the child&rsquo;s parents until the initiation ceremony. It is the name with which the initiated child or person makes his formal salutations (yena nāmnopanīto &lsquo;bhivādayate; Nār.on Asv.gr.I.15.10). But even this is disputed by some authorities. The Gobhilagṛhyasūtra, for example, distinguishes between the secret name given at birth (Gobh.gr.II.7.15-16); the ordinary name, derived according to elaborate directions and given at the name-giving ceremony (Gobh.gr.II.8.8,14-16); and the abhivādanī- ya name received at the initiation ceremony (Gobh.gr.II.10.21-5).</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[161]]</p>
<p>There is even the suggestion that the last of these is received from the teacher himself.</p>
<p>For our purposes, however, we need only distinguish between the ordinary name used every day (vyāvahārikanāma) and the one used by the initiated person for formal salutations to this teacher and more learned elders (abhivādanīyanāma). Haradatta&rsquo;s comment on Gaut.I.6.5 explains when each should be used. The sūtra itself rules that &lsquo;on meeting those who know&rsquo; (jñasamavāye), the salutation should be made &lsquo;using one&rsquo;s own name&rsquo; (svanāma procya). Haradatta&rsquo;s comment falls into two parts. When meeting someone who knows how to make the proper response (yaḥ pratyabhivadanā- bhijñas tena samgame), one should use one&rsquo;s ordinary public name (vyāvahārikam prasiddham nāma). But with regard to those who actually understand the meaning of the salutation (arthajñānām), when meeting such excellent acquaintances (jñātavarasamavāye), one should use one&rsquo;s secret name (svanāma guhyam).</p>
<p>The implication of Tryambaka&rsquo;s ruling is now clear. For one of the major assumptions on which Tryambaka&rsquo;s treatise is based is that women are not entitled to initiation (see section I, pp.34–9). If this is so, then there can be no secret or abhivādanīya name for women. Thus any formal salutation made by a woman necessarily entails her ordinary or vyavahāropayukta name. Tryambaka returns to this topic in his comments on offering obeisance to one&rsquo;s husband (see below, pp. 162–3).</p>
<p>In the context of names, we may also note that a number of individuals are traditionally not to be addressed by name, as a mark of respect. These include one&rsquo;s husband and one&rsquo;s wife as well as one&rsquo;s father, mother, uncle, father-in-law and mother&rsquo;s sister, one&rsquo;s teacher (ācārya), his wife and son, one&rsquo;s guru or benefactor (hitaiṣin), an initiated person (dīkṣita) and a learned one (vidvāms; Har. on Gaut.I.2.29). In his section on general behaviour, Tryambaka stresses the point that the good wife never utters her husband&rsquo;s name (Sdhp.23r.3-4; section IV, pp. 273-4). Even today in Maharashtra, the traditional wife will say &lsquo;My husband is out&rsquo;, without mentioning his name. A generation ago, that too would have been contrary to strict tradition: she would have said, &ldquo;The coat is not here&rsquo; or &lsquo;I see no turban&rsquo;, thereby implying her husband&rsquo;s absence (LSJ).</p>
<p>Tryambaka begins with the homage (pādavandanam) a woman owes her parents-in-law. According to a half-sloka from Yajnavalkya</p>
<p>[[162]]</p>
<p>(attributed by Tryambaka to Vijñānesvara), &rsquo;the woman who is devoted to her husband (bhartṛtatparā) should pay homage to the feet of her parents-in-law.&ldquo;2 It is not clear (either from Tryambaka or from Yājñavalkya) whether this involves clasping both feet as in upasamgrahana or merely touching the feet (pādaspassana; see above, pp. 157-60). According to Gautama, upasamgrahaṇa is appropriate (Gaut.I.6.1-3). In traditional areas of India today, however, when the gesture is performed by a man, the joined hands touch the recipient&rsquo;s feet or the ground once. But when performed by a woman, they touch the ground alone and then are shaken briefly up and down. Judging by the customs still in force today, therefore, upasamgrahana is not appropriate for women. Either way, the ruling presupposes the custom of living in a joint family.</p>
<p>Vijñāneśvara glosses bhartṛtatparā as &lsquo;a virtuous wife, obedient to the will of her husband&rsquo; (bhartrvaśavartinī satī). ‘Parents-in-law&rsquo; (śvaśurayoḥ) is extended to include other people worthy of this honour (mānyāntaropalakṣaṇārtham; cf. Pāṇ.1.2.71). For example, when Rāma determines to go into exile without Sītā, he reminds her of the proper way to start her day: rise at dawn, worship the gods, pay homage to his father (vanditavyo daśarathaḥ pitā mama), his mother Kausalyā, and all his step-mothers, offering her services to each in turn (Ram.II.26.30–2).</p>
<p>For the obeisance of the wife to her husband, Tryambaka uses the term namaskāra. As noted above, this term-usually reserved for the worship of images or for paying homage to august individuals -covers respectful gestures ranging from the bowing of the head with hands together to the full prostration of the body. It is clear that Tryambaka considers full obeisance appropriate here. In his section on women&rsquo;s property, for example, Kausalyā is described paying homage to her husband, saying &lsquo;I bow my head to you (prasādaye tvām śirasā); I am prostrate on the ground before you (bhūmau nipatitasmi te).&rsquo; For Tryambaka, this is the mark of the true pativratā (kausalyāyāḥ pativratādharmānuṣṭhānāvagamāt; Sdhp.26[2]v.2–4, from the section on strīdhanam, pp.277–80).</p>
<p>In this section, however, &lsquo;further details regarding the obeisance due to the husband (bhartṛnamaskāre) are provided by Gautama.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[163]]</p>
<p>The quotation concerns the name the wife should use in the salutation, and reads as follows. &lsquo;Some authorities maintain that there is no rule regarding salutations between a man and a woman (strīpumyoge; glossed by Haradatta as jāyāpatisamavāye, &ldquo;when wife and husband meet&rdquo;).&ldquo;3 Since a superior never salutes an inferior, what is at issue here is how a wife should salute her husband and not vice versa (jāyaya bhartur abhivādane; Mask. on Gaut. VI.6). According to Tryambaka&rsquo;s explanation, &rsquo;this means that there is no rule to the effect that when such a salutation is being made (by the wife to the husband), an abhivādanīya name must be used; she should use instead whatever ordinary name (vyavahāropayukta) is current at that time.&rsquo; The implications of this statement are discussed above. Haradatta and Maskarin say much the same thing, adding only one proviso. If the husband knows the rules of formal responses (yady api bhartā pratyabhivādanajñaḥ; Har., Mask.) then there is no need for any modifying rule (aham ayam ity evamādi niyamo nāsti; Mask.); she may use any form of address (yena kenacit prakāreṇa kartavyam, Mask.).</p>
<p>As noted briefly above, the morning salutation is closely associated with, and usually followed by, a variety of personal services. According to Tryambaka, &rsquo;the wife should perform such services (śuśruṣaṇam) herself, whether for parents-in-law or husband, even if other attendants (servants) are available.&rsquo; In support of this statement, Tryambaka quotes from several different episodes in the Mahabharata. To avoid repetition, I have taken these quotations out of sequence: the first group applies to the parents-in-law, the second to the husband (see notes 6–12).</p>
<p>The behaviour appropriate to one&rsquo;s in-laws is described in a śloka taken from Draupadi&rsquo;s advice to Satyabhama on the proper conduct of the wife as given in the Vanaparvan (draupadisatyabhāmāsamvādaparvan, Mbh.III.222-4; cf. section IV, pp. 280-1).</p>
<p>[[164]]</p>
<p>Siridharmapaddhati</p>
<p>She describes her own behaviour towards her senior mother-in-law. &lsquo;With regard to liquid refreshment, clothes and food, I always attend upon the noble Kunti, mother of heroes, speaker of truth, myself.&lsquo;6</p>
<p>Another sloka to the same effect is taken from Draupadi&rsquo;s long complaint to Bhima in the Virāṭaparvan concerning the miseries of her life disguised as a maid-servant at the court of Viraṭa (Mbh.IV. 16.5–IV.20.35). Showing Bhīma her calloused hands, Draupadi exclaims: &lsquo;I who have never ground sandalwood paste myself even to apply it to my own body-only to Kunti&rsquo;s-see, if you please, how I am grinding it today!&ldquo;7 The implication is clear: sandalwood for her own use would be ground by a servant; that for Kunti she would, as a mark of special respect, always grind herself.</p>
<p>A third quotation on this subject is taken from the last part of Uma&rsquo;s discourse to Maheśvara on the duties of women in the Anuśānaparvan (umāmaheśvarasamvadaḥ; Mbh.XIII.126–134; cf. pp. 161-2). “That which is to be done for one&rsquo;s parents-in-law (should be performed) with the same respect as is due to one&rsquo;s husband. That woman, endowed with virtues, who pays homage to (toṣayanti; lit. ‘gratifying&rsquo; or &lsquo;appeasing&rsquo;) the feet of her parents-inlaw and is always devoted to her mother and father, is rich in religious austerity.&lsquo;8</p>
<p>The behaviour appropriate to one&rsquo;s husband is described in a second sloka from Draupadi&rsquo;s advice to Satyabhāmā in the Vanaparvan (cf. note 6). &lsquo;And when the maid-servant has been sent away, rise up (yourself): one should do everything oneself. Let Krsna know your feelings (bhāva), Satya, let him think &ldquo;She (loves and)</p>
<p>and tapodhana). See also Sdhp.32v.4-5, section IV.4.d.</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[165]]</p>
<p>serves (bhajat [i]) me with all her being.&rdquo; For the range of meanings associated with the verb bhaj, see Tryambaka&rsquo;s introductory verses (pp. 29-30).</p>
<p>Further evidence to the same effect comes from Bhīṣma&rsquo;s discourse to Yudhisthira on the division of inheritance in the Anusā- sanaparvan (rikthavibhāga; Mbh.XIII.47). ‘If the wife is there, no one else should ever attend to (make the preparations for) her husband&rsquo;s bath, toilette, teeth-cleaning, collyrium, oblations to the gods, offerings to the ancestors, or anything else relating to his religious duty (dharmayuktam) in the home.&lsquo;10 In the context of Tryambaka&rsquo;s treatise, the phrase &rsquo;no one else&rsquo; excludes servants and the &lsquo;other attendants&rsquo; (paricāraka) referred to earlier. In the context of the Mahābhārata, it is intended to exclude all junior wives. Tryambaka takes this point next.</p>
<p>Like Bhisma in his discourse to Yudhisthira (and with similar incongruence), Tryambaka takes the brahmin and not the kṣatriya as his case in point. &lsquo;Although-in all ages except the kali age&ndash; marrying (women of) other varṇas is (permitted) for a brahmin man, (those tasks listed above) should be performed only by his brahmin wife.&lsquo;11 Continuing to quote from Bhisma&rsquo;s lecture to Yudhisthira, but out of sequence, Tryambaka explains. &lsquo;(Even if) he marries a brahmin woman after he has (already) taken three wives (of other varnas), she should be his senior wife (jyeṣṭhā), the one worthy of honour, the superior one. This brahmin wife alone should perform (those services) for that brahmin man, O Yudhisthira. Food, liquid refreshment, garlands, clothes and ornaments should be given to the husband by his brahmin wife, for she is the superior one. And if he does otherwise due to infatuation (kāmāt, i.e. for another wife; mohat, Manu IX.87), O Yudhisthira, then, as</p>
<p>[[166]]</p>
<p>was foreseen by the ancients, he will become a candāla among brahmins.&lsquo;12</p>
<p>Several points may be made here. First, the classification of daily duties such as bathing, teeth-cleaning and so on as &lsquo;relating to religious duty&rsquo; (dharmayuktam) means that the wife&rsquo;s services in these matters are classed as services in the religious sphere. A similar verse in Manu (IX.86) groups the wife&rsquo;s personal services to her husband (bhartuḥ śarīrasuśruṣām) and her religious obligations towards him (dharmakaryam) together as complementary parts of her religious path. The rules in operation here are thus much the same as those described earlier for selecting a dharmapatni for religious rituals proper (section IIB, pp. 121-8).</p>
<p>Secondly, it is curious that Tryambaka quotes in full a sloka that in fact prohibits the marrying of women from other varnas in the kali age. For there is no doubt, either historically or within the context of this treatise, that polygamy of this kind figured prominently in Tryambaka&rsquo;s world. Perhaps we should assume that the general rule concerning the pre-eminence of the senior wife of the same caste applies to all three varnas (cf. Manu IX.86), whereas the sub-rule prohibiting marriages with wives of other varṇas applies only to the more elevated brahmin (such as Tryambaka himself). Certainly, polygamy is the mark of the prosperous and military kṣatriya class (cf. section IIB, pp. 121–8).</p>
<p>Finally, the epithet brāhmaṇacanḍāla in a similar verse in Manu is defined by Raghavananda as &lsquo;one who is regarded as a candāla because of his despicable behaviour&rsquo; (kutsitācāratvāc caṇḍālavad upekṣyaḥ; Ragh. on Manu IX.87). The different spellings of candala (cāndāla) are correct.</p>
<p>These rulings regarding the proper behaviour of the wife (and in particular, the senior wife or jyestha) towards her husband are</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[167]]</p>
<p>strongly reminiscent of those describing the proper behaviour of the student towards his teacher. According to Baudhayana, for example, the duties of the student include attending to his teacher&rsquo;s morning toilet (prasādhana), rubbing his body with oil (ucchādana; alternatively utsādana, shampooing&rsquo;), helping him bath (snapanam), eating the remains of his meal (ucchiṣṭa; cf. pp. 221–7), and so on (Baudh. 1.2.3.35). By the process of identification mentioned above, he should perform the same services for his teacher&rsquo;s wife (Baudh. I.2.3.37), although Manu&rsquo;s condemnation of this practice (II.211) seems more in keeping with orthodox views on the natural promiscuity of women (see section III). In his eagerness to be of service, the student should run after his teacher if he runs (dhā- vantam anudhāvet), walk with him when he walks (gacchantam anugacchet), stand beside him when he stands (tiṣṭhantam anutiṣṭhet; Baudh.I.2.3.38; Ap.1.2.6.7-9; Vas. VII.12; Manu II.196). Manu II.202 adds that the student should not employ anyone else to honour his teacher while he himself stands apart (durasth[ah]; parahastapreṣitapraṇāma, Sarv.; anyam niyujya malyavastrādinā gurum nārcayet, Kull.). In the same way, while she may delegate her more mundane household tasks (see section IIA, pp. 64–5), the ideal wife should not delegate any service to her husband to another, whether servant or co-wife.</p>
<p>Perhaps the supreme reinforcement of this parallel, combined with the adulation of in-laws, is to be found in the story of the mongoose (nakulopākḥyāna; Mbh.XIV.91-6, esp.93.50-1), surprisingly not cited by Tryambaka. The story relates how a poor brahmin lived with his wife, son and daughter-in-law in abject poverty during a famine. When the god Dharma appears in the guise of a guest, the brahmin gives him his last measure of ground barley. Begging to be allowed to follow his example, the daughter-in-law delivers an impassioned speech on the homage due to the father-in-law. &lsquo;You are the guru of my guru (guror mama gurus tvam) since you are the god of my god (yato daivatadaivatam). Thus you are the supreme god of gods (devātidevaḥ). Everything-my body, my life (prāṇaḥ), my religious duty (dharma) is intended solely to serve my guru (suśrūṣārtham idam guroh). Through your grace (tava prasādena), I shall attain the desired heavenly worlds.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The three atigurus of a woman&rsquo;s religious life are her husband and her parents-in-law. By serving them devotedly all her life, as a</p>
<p>[[168]]</p>
<p>perpetual student serves his teacher (cf. Manu II.243-4, 249), she will achieve the highest reward.</p>
<p>Household tasks (2) (grhakṛtyam ;Sdhp.11r.10-12v.5)</p>
<p>According to the traditional eightfold division of the day, a man should devote the second part to Vedic study, and the third to the maintenance of his family (Dakṣa II.33-5; Yājñ.1.99–100; Vidyā- mṇava 1979:1; see pp.45-9). According to Tryambaka, however, women are excluded from Vedic study; and any work they do should be within the home. The good wife should therefore devote the equivalent period of the day (i.e. from dawn to shortly before midday) to household tasks. As Tryambaka explains, ‘after that (i.e. after making the appropriate salutations to husband and in-laws), she should attend to (lit. “consider”) her household duties. &lsquo;13</p>
<p>Tryambaka opens this section with a śloka (attributed to Vyāsa) describing the general qualities appropriate to the ideal wife. &lsquo;She should be one who brings good luck, one for whom it is natural to perform auspicious acts, one who loves making (the home) beautiful and contributing (in other ways) to the household.&lsquo;14 The first of these is a practical requirement. For a woman&rsquo;s power to bring good luck may be manifested in two ways: she is the mother of healthy sons, and her husband is alive and prosperous.</p>
<p>Tryambaka proceeds to describe in more detail one very important contribution (upakāra) the wife may be required to make. &lsquo;When commissioned to do so by her husband, she should perform such tasks as managing the (household) income.&lsquo;15 Tryambaka&rsquo;s evidence is drawn from Manu. &lsquo;He (the husband) should put her in charge of saving and spending money, keeping things (clean and) pure (sauce), religious matters (dharme), the preparation of food, and looking after the household utensils.&lsquo;16</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[169]]</p>
<p>The comment that follows is Tryambaka&rsquo;s. &ldquo;&ldquo;Saving money&rdquo; means &ldquo;keeping it safe&rdquo;. &ldquo;Spending&rdquo; means &ldquo;in ways not prohibited by the rulings of dharmaśāstra”. “Keeping things pure” covers &ldquo;objects, the body and so forth&rdquo;. &ldquo;Religious matters&rdquo; means &ldquo;such things as offering hospitality to guests&rdquo;. &ldquo;The preparation of food&rdquo; means &ldquo;cooking it&rdquo;. &ldquo;(Looking after) the household utensils&rdquo; means &ldquo;seeing to such household paraphernalia as beds, seats, water-pots and frying-pans&rdquo;. (This is how) he should employ his wife.&lsquo;17</p>
<p>Several points may be noted here. First, the reference to &lsquo;religious matters&rsquo; (dharma) is predictably interpreted to emphasize the more obviously domestic aspects of the wife&rsquo;s religious role: feeding her husband&rsquo;s guests rather than participating in the fire sacrifice or paying homage to the gods.</p>
<p>Secondly, while Tryambaka quotes Manu&rsquo;s ruling merely to support his statement that the wife should be called upon to act as household treasurer, the original context of that ruling is far less complimentary. For Manu IX.9 cautions men that if they wish to keep their offspring pure (prajāviśuddhyartham), they should guard their wives closely. Verse 10 adds that while no one can guard women by force (prasahya), they may be guarded by the following means (etair upayayogais tu). These &lsquo;means&rsquo; are spelled out in the verse Tryambaka has quoted: that is, women should be kept busy with household responsibilities. Verse 12 concludes that women confined under guard are not in fact guarded at all (arakṣitā[h]); those who in this way keep guard over themselves (ātmānam ātmanā yās tu rakṣeyuh) are (surakṣitāḥ). For a woman who is not kept busy might hang around the doorway looking out into the street, something Tryambaka expressly forbids (Sdhp.23r.6-7, from section IV, pp. 273-4), probably because that is believed to be one of the marks of a woman who is easily seduced (dvāradeśāvasthāyinī; Kām. V.1.52).</p>
<p>After a digression on whether or not the wife may speak to other men (pp. 170-6), Tryambaka returns to the subject of managing money. To avoid repetition, I include the relevant comment and quotation here.</p>
<p>[[170]]</p>
<p>Tryambaka explains. &lsquo;With the money given (to her by her husband) to cover her household tasks, the chief wife (patnī) should carry out those tasks in whatever way she can and (still) keep something back. But she should not keep anything back out of greed from the money given (to her) for religious purposes (dharm- ārtham).&lsquo;18 As evidence for this, Tryambaka quotes one and a half slokas attributed to Manu that say much the same thing. &lsquo;The husband should place in his wife&rsquo;s charge (lit. &ldquo;hand&rdquo;) the money which is to be spent on the home. She should carry out her household tasks and (yet in doing so) deliberately keep something back. But if she is given money for the purpose of religious donation (dān- ārtham), she should not keep any of that back out of greed.&lsquo;19</p>
<p>Two points should be made here. First, both Tryambaka&rsquo;s statement and the quotation that follows use the word patnī, indicating that the role of household treasurer is to be taken by the senior wife of the same caste as her husband. Presumably the same rules of selection discussed above (see pp. 121-8) would operate in this sphere too.</p>
<p>Secondly, Tryambaka&rsquo;s phrase &lsquo;for religious purposes&rsquo; (dharm- ārtham) is replaced in the quotation by &lsquo;for religious donation&rsquo; (dānārtham). The latter more specific term excludes such possibilities as the wife buying the items required for a sacrifice or paying the priests. It also raises the much-debated question of whether or not the wife owns any money or property herself, and thus whether she may give or withhold religious donations in her own right. Tryambaka returns to this question in his section IV on women&rsquo;s property (see pp. 277-80).</p>
<p>The rest of this section on household tasks is taken up with a lengthy discussion of whether or not the ideal wife may talk to other men (a topic also raised in Sdhp.24r.1-24v.7, see section IV, pp. 273– 4); cf. Dharmāk.III.p.175ff.). Strictly speaking, the term parapuruṣa denotes any man other than her husband; by extension, as Tryam-</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[171]]</p>
<p>baka eventually explains, it denotes any man who is not related to her.</p>
<p>Tryambaka presents the problem. &ldquo;The objection may be made (nanu) that a woman cannot attend to her household tasks without speaking to other men and yet, because of the prohibition &ldquo;she should not speak to any other man”, this is not allowed. But this objection is not valid (iti cen na).&lsquo;20 For that same prohibition (attributed here to Sankha), when given in full, in fact runs as follows. &lsquo;She should not talk to any other man apart from traders, renouncers (pravrajita°), doctors and old men.&rsquo; It thus allows women to &lsquo;converse with those men who are instrumental in her affairs&rsquo;,21</p>
<p>We may note here that while a woman may converse with a male renouncer she may have nothing to do with his female counterpart. For in section IV, there is an even fuller version of this quotation. It culminates in a list of women with whom the good wife should not associate: courtesans (gaṇikā), women who gamble (dhūrtā), women who meet lovers in secret (abhisārini), female renouncers (pravrajitā), and so on (Sdhp.22v.1-3, see pp. 273-4). The term pravrajitā includes both traditional female ascetics and the heretical orders of nuns. A similar passage attributed to Markandeya rules that the good wife should never be friendly with a female sceptic (haitukī) or a female religious mendicant (śramanā, Sdhp.23v.5-6; see also section IV, note 26). The former term condemns women who question the traditional values preached by Hindu orthodoxy; the latter condemns those who have already rejected them. The orthodox viewpoint is clear. Men may choose to renounce family life and devote themselves to their religion; women may not. For a woman&rsquo;s religion is her family life. Hence the ruling in Tryambaka&rsquo;s section on things to be avoided: renunciation (pravrajya) is one of the six things that cause women and sūdras to fall (see section IV, note 7). We should add here that female mendicants are also under suspicion</p>
<p>[[172]]</p>
<p>for another reason altogether: they (together with widows) are included in the list of &lsquo;go-betweens&rsquo; (dūtī) considered suitable for conducting illicit affairs (bhikṣukī; Kām.V.4.62).</p>
<p>But what should the good wife do if neither husband nor male relative is there to speak on her behalf? Tryambaka tackles this question next. &lsquo;In times of difficulty-that is, when there is no other speaker except a man unrelated to her (i.e. no one else who might speak for her)—then she will not be at fault if she speaks to him either after placing a blade of grass between the two of them (tṛṇam antarataḥ kṛtva) or directly (sākṣād).&ldquo;22 For each of these possibilities, Tryambaka produces an epic example.</p>
<p>First, the custom of placing a blade of grass between the chaste wife and an unrelated man as a symbolic barrier is traced to an incident described in the Rāmāyaṇa (Rām.V.21). Sītā has been carried off to Lankā by the demon Rāvaṇa who proceeds to declare his love. Tryambaka&rsquo;s quotation-in fact taken from the version of the Rāmāyana embedded in his Dharmākūta-details Sītā&rsquo;s response. &lsquo;Addressed in this way (by Ravana), Sītā, tormented by grief, was without fear. Placing a blade of grass between them (trnam antarataḥ kṛtva), she answered Rāvana. &lsquo;23</p>
<p>The crucial phrase, tṛṇam antarataḥ kṛtvā, appears both in the Rāmāyaṇa episode (Rām. V.21.1-3) and in the Mahabharata&rsquo;s version of the story (rāmopākhyānam, Mbh.III.265.17; see note 23). Van Buitenen (1978:III, p.741) translates the latter as &lsquo;counting him no more than a straw in her heart&rsquo;. However, there is a confusion here between the literal meaning of the phrase and the metaphorical meaning expressed by the cvi formation trnikṛ (cf.Pan.V.4.50 ff.). It seems evident, both from the Sanskrit itself and from Tryambaka&rsquo;s interpretation of it, that the literal meaning is intended here: Sītā actually places the grass between them, thereby establishing a</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[173]]</p>
<p>symbolic &lsquo;barrier&rsquo; between herself and the parapuruṣa with whom she should not converse. It is quite likely, of course, that the phrase is also a kind of pun, evoking the contempt of the cvi formation. Certainly, in the Madras edition I have used, the chapter describing the incident is entitled rāvanatṛnikaranam (Rām.V.21, subheading). But a translation that completely omits the literal meaning misses the point.24</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s example of a good woman speaking directly to an unrelated man (without a symbolic grass &lsquo;barrier&rsquo;) is taken from the &lsquo;abduction of Draupadi&rsquo; episode in the Vanaparvan of the Mahābhārata (draupadipramathe, Sdhp.11v.11; draupadiharaṇaparvan, Mbh.III.248-53). The five Pandavas have gone hunting, leaving Draupadi alone in the forest. King Jayadratha, who is looking for a wife (vivāhakāmaḥ; Mbh.III.248.6), sees Draupadi and sends his friend, King Koṭikāśya, to find out who she is. Mbh. III.250 presents Draupadi&rsquo;s response to Kotikāsya&rsquo;s questions; Tryambaka quotes most of it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Questioned in this way by the chief of the Sibis, Princess Draupadi looked at him slowly (mandam). (Van Buitenen&rsquo;s &ldquo;with a languid glance&rdquo; does not, I think, convey the implied reluctance of a high-born woman confronted with someone to whom she should not normally speak.)-Letting go the branch (she had been holding), she gathered together her silken upper garment (samgṛhnati kausikam uttarīyam; that is, she drew the garment demurely across her face and upper body; cf. van Buitenen&rsquo;s &ldquo;kuśa grass skirt&rdquo;) and spoke.25 &ldquo;O son of Narendra, I know in my heart (buddhyā) that a woman like me is not permitted to converse with you. But you have spoken and there is no one else here to answer you, neither man nor woman; for I am on my own at present. I shall answer you for this reason (i.e. and this reason alone)—be sure, sir, that you understand this. (Van Buitenen&rsquo;s &rsquo;listen well&rsquo; conveys neither her anxiety nor her reasoning.) For I am alone in the forest, ruled by my own religious law (niyatā svadharme; i.e. as an orthodox wife), so how may I con-</p>
<p>[[174]]</p>
<p>verse with you when you are also here alone ?26 I (already) know that you are Suratha&rsquo;s son, whom men call Kotikāśya. I shall therefore do the same for you, O Śaibya, and tell you about my relations and my celebrated family.27 (Tryambaka in fact omits verse 5 which explains that she is Drupada&rsquo;s daughter and the wife of the five Pandavas.) The sons of Pṛthả (Kuntī as chief wife)- Yudhisthira, Bhimasena and Arjuna, and the two most heroic sons of Mādrī— have left me here and gone out hunting in each of the four directions.28 (Tryambaka omits the half-verse that describes which husband went where.) But I think it is almost time for these supreme charioteers to return here. When you have received (due) honour from them, you may go as you wish; (until then) unharness your horses and dismount. (Yudhisthira,) the great-souled son of Dharma loves to receive guests and so he will be pleased to see you.29 Saying so much (i.e. and no more) to the son of the Saibya king, Drupada&rsquo;s moon-faced daughter departed. Thinking (only) of her duty to offer hospitality to them (as her husbands&rsquo; guests), she entered that excellent hut made of leaves. &lsquo;30</p>
<p>Tryambaka concludes that &rsquo;this is how women should talk to</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[175]]</p>
<p>men to whom they are not related&rsquo;. He adds that &rsquo;there is no blame attached to conversing with those to whom they are related (svīyaiḥ saha).&lsquo;31 We need only note here that Tryambaka&rsquo;s extremely orthodox advice is of no practical value to either Sītā or Draupadi. Each in turn follows the rules of stridharma to the letter; both are abducted anyway. Tryambaka&rsquo;s satisfaction with their behaviour stems not from the success of either strategem but from the fact that, in orthodox eyes, neither Sitā nor Draupadi is to blame. For a woman that is small consolation.</p>
<p>This topic is evidently dear to Tryambaka&rsquo;s heart for it reappears at some length in his section on general behaviour (section IV, pp.273- 4). The picture he paints there of the perfect wife still holds good for traditional India today. Even if another man entices her with good things (lobhitapi pareṇārthaih), begs her humbly (dainyena prarthitā vāpi), seizes her by force (balena vidhṛtāpi vā), or clothes her in fine garments (vastrādyair vāsitā vāpi), the good wife never loves another man (the term bhajate implying here love, homage, domestic service and sexual favours; cf. section I, introductory verse 1). If another man looks at her, she does not meet his eyes (vīkṣitā vīkṣate nānyam); if he smiles at her, she does not smile back (hasita na hasaty api); if he speaks to her, she does not answer (bhāṣitā bhāṣate nānyam). By implication (according to the pramana of arthapatti accepted by mīmāmsā), touching another man is also prohibited (sparso &lsquo;pi arthāt pratiṣidhyate; Sdhp.24r.1-24v.7). This is still the description of the virtuous Hindu wife today, especially in the north, even in the comparatively modern middle class.32 In the south, however, the women seem noticeably more relaxed. If this was also the case in Tryambaka&rsquo;s time, it would</p>
<p>[[176]]</p>
<p>explain why he felt it so necessary to stress the point for the Maratha women at the court of Thanjavur.</p>
<p>Tryambaka pursues the question of physical contact further in section IV. When Rāvana carries Sītā off by force, and therefore touches her, being unprotected (anīśā) she is not to blame. But when Hanuman offers to carry her to safety, she cannot bring herself to touch the body (gatram) of a man who is not her husband (Sdhp. 24r.5-7). Tryambaka then argues that when a priest at a śrauta ritual binds the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife with a girdle of kusa grass, his touch is that of a father (duhitrvat gurutvāt) and so does not pollute (Sdhp.24r.8-10). Similarly, although Sītā rejects the touch of Hanuman as that of another man, she assents to that of Agni (when she enters the fire to prove her innocence to Rama) because he is her father (the husband of Pṛthivi, the earth from which Sītā emerged; Sdhp.24r.10-24 v.6). However, since Ghatotkaca (Bhima&rsquo;s son by the rakṣasi, Hidimba) carried Draupadi (Ghatotkaca&rsquo;s stepmother), a woman may touch her (step-)son (Sdhp.24v.6-7). This concern to avoid physical contact with those outside one&rsquo;s immediate family is still in evidence today.33</p>
<p>Midday rituals (Sdhp. 12v. 5–16v.7)</p>
<p>In the fourth division of the traditional eightfold day, a man should take his midday bath; make a tarpana offering of water to gods, sages and ancestors; perform the midday samdhyā ritual; and worship the gods (Dakṣa II.43; Yajñ.I.100; Vidyarṇava 1979:1; PVK II.i.p.689; see above, pp. 44-9). With reference to women, Tryambaka mentions only the last of these (devapūjā; see below, pp. 178-80) and states that it is to be performed by the husband (bhartrā kriyamanadevapujāyām; Sdhp.12v.5-6) not the wife.</p>
<p>In the fifth division of an eightfold day, before his midday meal, a man should perform the &lsquo;five great sacrifices&rsquo; (pañcamahāyajñāḥ)</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[177]]</p>
<p>comprising offerings to Brahman (brahmayajña; the study and teaching of the Veda; cf. Manu III. 70ff.; japa, Kull.), the gods (devayajña; homa, Kull.), the ancestors (pitṛyajña; tarpaṇa, Kull.), men (manuṣyayajña; atithipūjā, Kull.) and all beings (bhūtayajña; bali, Kull.). With reference to women, Tryambaka mentions only four rituals; and these do not correspond exactly with the previously mentioned five. The vaiśvadeva ritual (see pp. 180-3) comprises offerings of cooked food to all gods and is said by some authorities to correspond to the devayajña, pitṛyajña and bhūtayajña (Sm.A.p.47; Par.M.I.i.p.389; Dakṣa II.56; cf. Gonda 1980:414–15). According to others, the requirements of these three are met by the vaiśvadeva and baliharana rituals together (e.g. Gov. on Baudh. II.6.11.4). Hospitality to guests (atithipūjā, see pp. 183-210), corresponds to manuṣyavajña. Balidāna, an offering to the goddess Jyesṭhā (see pp. 277-9), seems to be the wife&rsquo;s version of baliharana (bhūtayajña; cf. Gonda 1980:417ff.). Brahmayajña (consisting of Vedic study) is predictably not mentioned.</p>
<p>Before describing the wife&rsquo;s role in these midday rituals, something must be said about the obvious parallels and duplications evident in the various forms of worship. For, as Vedic sacrifice became rarer, alternative rituals developed alongside it, each carrying with it confusing echoes of the fire ritual. I have already discussed in some detail the śrauta fire sacrifice (agnihotra), its gṛhya counterpart (aupāsanahoma), and the twiceor thrice-daily samdhyā ritual (see pp. 102-7). The parallels and overlaps there are obvious. The substitution of the breaths for the sacred fires in prāṇāgnihotra is yet another echo of Vedic sacrifice, as is the further development into the ritual offering of food (bhojanavidhi).</p>
<p>Several of the rituals are performed twice a day: the homa offerings and twilight worship take place at sunrise and sunset; the ‘five great sacrifices&rsquo;, the vaiśvadeva ritual and bali offerings shortly before the midday and evening meals. If all or even some of these are observed, then there are inevitable duplications. To avoid this, Manu, for example, identifies homa with devayajña (Manu III.70, and Kull., Sarv.; Mit. on Yajñ.I.102). While admitting that others disagree, Haradatta identifies the vaisvadeva ritual with both devayajña and the domestic homa ritual (Har. on Ap.I.4.13.1; cf. Bodewitz 1976:191). Vidyarṇava, in his modern account of the midday duties required of the orthodox male, writes of the ‘Deva-</p>
<p>[[178]]</p>
<p>yajña or the offering to fire, called also Homa, or Viśva offering&rsquo; (1979:154).</p>
<p>Image worship (devapūjā) seems at first to be subsumed in devayajña. For, although the term itself is of long standing (see Pāṇ.I.3.25), the earlier dharmasastra texts do not list it separately among the daily duties of the orthodox. Gaut.I.2.12.17, for example, mentions only the homa offering and samdhyā (cf. Āp.1.1.4.16–17; Baudh.I.2.3.19). Later smrtis, however, distinguish clearly between the two. Manu, for example, advocates image worship (devatā- bhyarcanam; hariharādidevapūjanam, Kull.) alongside offerings to gods, sages and ancestors (devarṣipitṛtarpanam) and the fire ritual (samidādhānam; samiddhomam, Kull.). According to some authorities, it should be performed after the morning homa (Sm.M.II. p.383, Marici) or after the midday observation of brahmayajña and tarpaṇa (Sm.M.II.p.383, Hārīta). According to Daksa II.30-1, all rituals for the gods (devakarya) should be performed in the first half of the day. By late medieval and modern times, however, devapūjā had almost totally replaced the earlier rituals from which it had evolved (cf. PVK II.ii.p. 705 ff.).</p>
<p>Image worship (devapūjā; Sdhp.12v.5-8)</p>
<p>Despite the vast medieval literature on the subject, Tryambaka tells us very little about the procedure of worship. Of the long list of actions advocated (upacāra; cf. Sm.C.II.p.532ff.; PVK II.ii. pp. 729 ff.), he names only naivedya, and that in his section on the preparation of food for the vaiśvadeva ritual (pp. 180-3). For Tryambaka is concerned solely with the wife&rsquo;s role and it is a subsidiary one.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When the devapuja is being performed by the husband, she (presumably the patni), without being told (to do so), should herself make ready all the items necessary for it.&lsquo;34 Tryambaka&rsquo;s evidence for this statement is drawn from two slokas attributed here to Vyasa. The first of these (with the lines reversed and attributed to &lsquo;Skanda&rsquo;) has already been mentioned in section IIA (Sdhp. 4r.3-4; p.65). Both slokas reappear as part of a longer quotation (also attributed to &lsquo;Skanda&rsquo;) in the section on general behaviour (Sdhp.23r.7-9; p.273). They read as follows. &lsquo;She herself, with-</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[179]]</p>
<p>out being told (to do so), should make ready all the items for worship such as the water for the observances and the sacred grass, together with leaves, flowers, unbroken rice and so on. Without anxiety and with great joy, anticipating (each) moment, she should place everything near (her husband), (each item) at the appropriate time, &lsquo;35</p>
<p>The items specified may be related to the various stages of worship (upacāra). For example, fresh water (cf. Vis.Sm.66.1) is required for several procedures: for washing the feet of the image (pādya), for bathing it (snāna), for sipping (ācamana), and for the arghya offering. The sacred grass (barhis) forms a seat for the worshipper (see Vir.P.p.95 on āsanam). Various kinds of leaves are recommended for the worship of Siva, including those of the woodapple (bilva), apāmārga and acacia (sami) trees, and the blue lotus (Vir.P.p.210). Basil (tulasi) leaves are offered to Visnu, either separately or when flowers are unavailable. They may also be mixed in the water used for bathing the images (Vir.P.p.42-9). Flowers of various kinds are offered in a separate upacara (puspa). The Visnusmrti prohibits the use of flowers that smell unpleasant or have no smell at all; white ones are allowed, if they smell nice; red ones, especially those that grow in water (jalajam; raktotpalam, Nand.) are best (Vis.Sm.66.5-9). For the worship of Śiva, arka, oleander (karavīra), drona, kuśa, datura (dhattūra) and acacia (samī) flowers are recommended, but the blue lotus is best (Vir.P. p. 210). Different flowers are listed for the worship of Visnu: various kinds of jasmine (vanamallikā, vāsantī, mālatī, kunda), magnolia (campaka) and aśoka flowers, and best of all the jātī jasmine (Vir. P.p.51). If the worshipper cannot afford the more expensive items required for certain upacaras (clothes, ornaments, unguents, etc.), he may use flowers instead. Flowers and unbroken rice are also added to the arghya offering of water, along with other items such as particular grasses, milk, curd, honey and so on (section IIB, p.151).</p>
<p>[[180]]</p>
<p>As described by Tryambaka, this is a classic example of the wife&rsquo;s role of assistant to her husband in religious rituals (dharmapatni). Strictly speaking, this is the case even in domestic image worship today. For while the wife or mother of an orthodox household may spend a large amount of time in the pūjā roomperhaps offering various upacāras without mantras, or following the śūdra example of using puranic mantras instead-in orthodox terms, her worship is strictly devotional. For unless a woman has been initiated, has undergone the required Vedic education, has been taught the mantras and precisely what to say and do, she may not offer the full devapujā with Vedic mantras herself. Her husband or a priest must do it for her. In fact, in today&rsquo;s pūjā, the woman usually does everything except the crucial part of the ritual reserved for her husband; he does that, and then goes to the office. She may also touch her husband&rsquo;s arm during the ceremony in order to earn her share of his merit. For in effect, now as in Tryambaka&rsquo;s day, she can only assist.</p>
<p>(The worship of) all gods (vaisvadeva; Sdhp.12v.8–13r.6).</p>
<p>As explained briefly above (pp. 177-8), this offering of cooked food to all the gods before a meal is one of several modern rituals that contain echoes of early Vedic sacrifice. According to Sm.C.II.p.570, for example, it may be offered into either the ordinary or the srauta fire (laukike vaidike vā, although vaidike is immediately glossed as vaivāhike; cf. also Medh. on Manu V.7). Several authors maintain that the vaisvadeva ritual is identical with devayajña; others that it corresponds to pitṛyajña and bhūtayajña as well. In the Dharmākūta, Tryambaka agrees with this last view, quoting Vyasa and the Smṛtyarthasara (Dharmāk.III.p.78). In the Stridharmapaddhati, however, he does not add to this discussion. Once again, he is concerned only with the part the wife must play: she should prepare the food to be offered; she should be present at the ritual; and she should decorate the place of worship.</p>
<p>‘After that (i.e. after the worship of the household images), she should do the cooking for the (offerings of food to) guests, all the gods, and so on. &lsquo;36 The first quotation produced deals with the preparation of food for guests; I shall return to it in the section concerning the role of the wife in the atithipūjā (p, 198, note 64). The</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[181]]</p>
<p>second quotation, attributed to Vyasa, applies to the vaiśvadeva ritual. &lsquo;After taking her (ritual) bath, the senior wife (patni) should cook (food) in the home: (that) for the naivedya ritual (should be prepared) in a separate pot, and the delicacies (vyañjanāni) for the vaiśvadeva ritual separately in another.&lsquo;37</p>
<p>The distinction here is between one of the upacāras of devapūjā (see pp. 178-80), and the independent vaisvadeva ritual. Various rulings are given about naivedya offerings. According to Vis. Sm.66.12-14, one may not offer any food that is normally forbidden, nor the milk of goats or buffaloes, nor the meat of five-toed animals, fish or wild boar. In general, however, the rule is the same for naivedya as it is for the vaiśvadeva ritual: one should offer to one&rsquo;s gods whatever food one eats oneself (Rām.II.102.30; 103.15; Medh. on Manu V.7). The Smrtyarthasara specifies that kṣāra, lavana and certain kinds of pulse should not be offered in the vaiśvadeva ritual (cf. Sm.C.II.p.574), thus recalling similar rulings relating to the fire ritual (see pp. 142-5). Tryambaka, however, tells us only that different pots should be used to cook the food intended for each ritual.</p>
<p>The term vyanjanāni, used in the narrow sense, denotes any form of spice or seasoning. In its wider sense, as used here, it covers any good food cooked with appetising seasoning and condiments. This presumably indicates that food for the gods should be prepared with as much care as that for the family.</p>
<p>Two more points should be made here. First, if naivedya is part of image worship (devapujā), then Tryambaka&rsquo;s sequence of events is wrong. The wife would have to prepare the naivedya offering before the ritual, not after it.</p>
<p>Secondly, unlike the sweeping and cleaning of the home, the cooking of food is not an independent household task for which the wife is solely responsible. It is a subsidiary part of the midday rituals performed by her husband. The offering of food to the gods is the principal part (pradhāna); both the preparation beforehand and the eating afterwards are subsidiary (anga) to it. Thus, even in the realm of food, the wife may be seen to be acting as her husband&rsquo;s assistant in religion and not independently.</p>
<p>[[182]]</p>
<p>Continuing this theme of the wife as religious assistant, Tryambaka explains that &rsquo;the patnī too should be present at the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual.&lsquo;38 He quotes Nārāyaṇa. &lsquo;Bathed, ritually pure, accompanied by his wife, and without speaking, (a man) should sip (water) according to the injunction, sit down and, when the fire is lit, he should perform the vaiśvadeva ritual.&lsquo;39 The quotation demonstrates that the male householder performs the ritual; all that is required of the wife at this stage is her presence. The question of the patni&rsquo;s presence at rituals is discussed in more detail with regard to the homa offerings (see above, pp.132-41). The overlap between homa, devayajña and vaiśvadeva suggests that the implications here are the same.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s final point in this subsection concerns the wife&rsquo;s role in decorating the place of worship. &lsquo;At the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual, the patnī should decorate with sandalwood paste and so on the places where food offerings (bali) are made.&lsquo;40 He quotes Baudhāyana. &lsquo;Silently (tūṣṇīm; i.e. without the recitation of mantras), the patni decorates all the places of worship (āyatanāni) with sandalwood paste, flowers, incense and lights.&lsquo;41</p>
<p>Several points may be noted here. The term tūṣṇīm recalls Baudhā- yana&rsquo;s orthodox views on women. For example, he admits that some people make funeral offerings when their married daughters die but argues that this is only done to placate the world (lokasamgrahaṇārtham), for women are held to be (without Vedic education and therefore) without mantras (tad amantrāḥ striyo matāḥ, Baudh.I.5.11.7; Manu IX.18).</p>
<p>Secondly, both the term ayatanāni (cf. agnyāyatanam) and the wife&rsquo;s task of decorating the hearth recall the very similar rulings described in the section on agniśuśrūṣā (pp. 107-15). According to Tryambaka, decorating the hearth is the wife&rsquo;s sole responsi-</p>

<p>bility in the fire sacrifice; in the vaiśvadeva ritual, she does the cooking too.</p>
<p>Finally, the references to sandalwood paste, flowers, incense and lights recall both the procedures of image worship (devapūjā), and the fact that it is the wife&rsquo;s job to gather together all the items required for religious worship (see above, pp.178-80).</p>
<p>Paying homage to guests (atithipūjā; Sdhp. 13r.6-16v.7) As mentioned above (pp.176-8), paying homage to guests by offering hospitality corresponds to manusyayajña, one of the &lsquo;five great sacrificés&rsquo; of the householder&rsquo;s day. Since the wife is instruūmental in the observation of this ritual-both preparing the food and serving it on her husband&rsquo;s behalfūthis section is a lengthy one. Tryambaka begins with some general rules concerning the timing of the ritual and the form it should take.</p>
<p>&lsquo;At the end of the vaiśvadeva ritual, if a guest has come, homage should be paid to him.&lsquo;42 Tryambaka quotes Āpastamba. &lsquo;The two owners (of the house, svāmin[au]; i.e. pati and patni) should not refuse anyone who asks for food at the (appropriate) time (kāle). If there is no (food), then (one should offer him) a place to sit (bhumi[h]; lit. &lsquo;ground&rsquo;), water, grass (or straw, tṛṇāni; i.e. to sit on) and a kind word (kalyāṇī vāg); these things never disappear in the house of a good man. Those two (i.e. the husband and wife) who beūhave in this way go to the eternal world.&lsquo;43</p>
<p>Kāle is glossed by Haradatta as &lsquo;after the vaiśvadeva ritual&rsquo; (Ujj.; cf. Mit. on Yājñ.I.107). In a similar śloka from Manu, bhūmi means &lsquo;a pleasant place to sit or sleep&rsquo; (āsanaśayanaviharasthānam; Medh. on Manu III.101); ‘grass&rsquo; means a couch or bed (śrastara, Medh.; sayaniya, Kull.). According to Nandana, grass should be offered if no (proper, i.e. wooden) seat is available (āsanābhāve); an area of ground if there is no bed (bhūmiḥ śayanābhāve). The</p>
<p>[[184]]</p>
<p>water is for such things as washing the guest&rsquo;s feet (pādaprakṣā- lanādyarthajala°; Kull.); according to Nandana, if there are no unguents with which to massage them (pādābhyañjanābhāve). Manu&rsquo;s &lsquo;friendly speech&rsquo; (sūnṛtā) is explained by Medhātithi as that which is both pleasant and salutary (priyahitavacanam). Nandana&rsquo;s gloss quotes Apastamba (kalyāṇī vāg) and adds that this is apūpropriate if there is no food (annābhāve).</p>
<p>To avoid repetition, I include at this point a similar general statement regarding timing and format, taken from Manu, but given by Tryambaka somewhat later in this section. &lsquo;After perūforming the bali offering in this way, one should first (pūrvam) feed the guest. According to the injunction (vidhipurvakam), one should offer any guest who has come (to one&rsquo;s house) a seat (āsano°) and water, and food too, according to one&rsquo;s resources, and making it as wholesome (satkṛtya) as one can.&lsquo;44</p>
<p>&lsquo;First&rsquo; here means before one takes one&rsquo;s own meal (purvam ātmanah, Sarv. on Manu III.94; pūrvam svabhojanāt, Rāgh.). &lsquo;According to the injunction&rsquo; is glossed by Sarvajñanārāyaṇa as &lsquo;according to the religious law pertaining to guests declared by Apastamba&rsquo; (Sarv. on Manu III.99). ‘Seat&rsquo; (āsana) means not just any place to sit but the low wooden seat, a few inches off the ground (so that one may comfortably sit cross-legged), that is traditionally offered to important people or guests (cf. pitha, Sdhp.40v.10; pīṭhanam āsanam, Amar.II.6.3.40). Satkṛtya may be taken in two ways. In Manu III.96, for example, Medhātithi and Govindarāja take it to mean &lsquo;paying homage&rsquo; (pūjayitvā, Medh.; phalapuspādinā, Gov.). However, Kulluka and Raghavananda on Manų III.99 take it with annam to indicate the appropriate attention given to preūparing the guest&rsquo;s food (vyañjanādibhiḥ satkṛtam cānnam, Kull.; vyañjanaiḥ samskṛtya, Rāgh.; cf. Kull. on Manu III.96). Because of the associations with the food offered in the vaiśvadeva ritual (cf. vyañjanāni, note 37). I have preferred the latter interpretation.</p>
<p>On these general points of timing and importance, a few obserūvations may be made. For example, Tryambaka makes no mention of the bali offering (balikarman) that according to Manu should precede the ritual of feeding the guest. I shall return to this point</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[185]]</p>
<p>when I deal with the wife&rsquo;s bali offering to the goddess Jyesthā (balidānam; see below, pp. 227–9).</p>
<p>The role of the wife is not at this point spelled out. Apastamba uses the dual form &rsquo;the two owners&rsquo; (svāminau), indicating that the responsibility for the ritual is shared jointly by husband and wife. This is a faint echo of the &rsquo;two sacrificers&rsquo; of Vedic times, the ideal of the married couple participating jointly in their religious obliūgations. If they behave as they should, both are rewarded in heaven. In contrast, Manu&rsquo;s rulings are couched in the masculine, without reference to the wife even in the dual form. Although it is clearly assumed that the wife must take care of the practical aspects of feeding the guest (see Manu III.103, and below, pp. 198-9), the responsibility for the ritual rests on the husband. The good wife who plays her part is thus participating in her husband&rsquo;s religious duty (prativratabhāgini) rather than her own.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s second point is to stress &rsquo;the necessity (āvaśyakatvam) of offering homage to the guest&rsquo;. The same point is made, in other contexts, elsewhere in the treatise. In Tryambaka&rsquo;s conclusion, for example, offering hospitality to the guest is the underlying theme in several of the lengthy stories told: in the story of the pigeons and the bird-catcher, the male pigeon offers his own body as food (section V, pp. 306- 7; in the story of Kausika, the ascetic&rsquo;s anger is caused by the lack of hospitality shown to him (section V, pp.308- 9); in the story of Sudarsana—according to whom, offering hospitality to the guest is the householder&rsquo;s supreme religious duty - his wife, Oghavati, is required to offer her body to the brahmin guest, and Death is conquered thereby (section V, pp. 310-12). In this section, however, Tryambaka draws upon the story of Naciketas in the Kathopaniṣad.45 This Upanisad is generally assigned to the Kathaka school of the Black Yajurveda. The same story appears in Tait.Br.III.11.8.1 ff. and, in a variety of forms, in both epic and purāna literature (e.g. Mbh.XIII.70; Var.P.p.194ff., 1103 ff.).</p>
<p>Tryambaka begins with a prose recapitulation of the story to proūvide the framework for the important quotations from the Kathopaūniṣad. This prose version, together with the three verses and the final prose comment enclosing them, reads as if it has all been taken from</p>
<p>[[186]]</p>
<p>some work such as Tryambaka&rsquo;s own Dharmākūta. Alternatively, the prose passages may be original to this treatise. The recapitula-</p>
<p>tion runs as follows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;(Naciketas&rsquo; father gave) as the fee (to the priests) for a sacriūfice he had begun, cows that had (already) drunk their (share of) water, eaten their (share of) grass and given their (share of) milk, and which no longer had any strength (i.e. to reproduce; apraūjananasamarthāḥ, Sankara, Dh.kosa II.iii.p.1389). Because of this fault in the sacrificial fee, i.e. in his (father&rsquo;s) gift of cows, Naciketas believed that his father would go to a world without joy (when he died). So, in order to remove that (fault), he asked his father again and again: &ldquo;To which particular priest will you give me?&rdquo; In anger, his father replied: &ldquo;I shall give you to Death!&rdquo; Because of the authority of his (father&rsquo;s) words, and because he believed that obeying the command of one&rsquo;s father is the most important religious law, he (Naciketas) went to the house of Yama. Since Yama was away, he stayed there for three days (lit. “nights”) without receiving the honour (due to a guest). Then, when Yama had completed his journey and returned, his ministers said to him&hellip;</p>
<p>&lsquo;46</p>
<p>Tryambaka then quotes the first of the three verses from the Kathopaniṣad. (Like) fire (vaiśvānaraḥ), the brahmin guest enters homes; they (i.e. good householders) pacify him (sāntim kurvanti) with this (hospitality): &ldquo;Fetch water, O Vaivasvata (Yama)!”’&lsquo;47 Sankara glosses vaiśvānarah as &rsquo;like a burning fire&rsquo; (agnir eva &hellip; dahann iva; Dh.kosa II.iii.p.1390; cf. Āp.II.3.6.3). The idea of ‘pacifying&rsquo; him (śāntim kurvantí) relates both to the proper treatūment of the guest and to the image of fire. Just as one needs to</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[187]]</p>
<p>‘quench&rsquo; a fire (dāham śamayanta iva; Śankara), so one must ‘apūpease&rsquo; the guest by offering water to wash his feet, a seat and so on (etām pādyāsanādidānalakṣaṇām&hellip; santo &rsquo;tithir; Sankara, Dh.kosa II.iii.p.1390). Hence the summons to bring water to wash Naciketas&rsquo; feet. The implication is clear: a guest not honoured in this way will destroy that household like a raging fire.</p>
<p>The second verse quoted continues this theme. ‘If a brahmin (guest) stays without eating in the house of (such) a foolish man, then hope and expectation, friendship and good fellowship, sacriūfice and charitable works, sons and cattle-all these he snatches away (from the negligent host). &lsquo;48</p>
<p>Although some dharmaśāstra texts enjoin that anyone who asks for food at the right time should be treated with the honour due to the guest (including kṣatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras, according to Baudh.II.3.5.11), it is often assumed-as it is hereūthat the proper recipient of such homage is the brahmin. According to Manu III. 110, for example, neither a kṣatriya, a vaiśya nor a sūdra should be welcomed in this way in a brahmin house. Gautama is equally specific: only a brahmin may be a ‘guest&rsquo; to a brahmin (brāhmaṇasyā- nathithir abrāhmaṇaḥ; Gaut.I.5.39). Visitors of lower varṇa should be given food (Baudh.II.3.5.14 suggests that the sudra should work for his) and treated kindly, but they do not merit the homage due to the brahmin guest (e.g. Manu III.111-12). It is thus because Naciketas is a brahmin that Yama is so anxious to make amends. Equally, it is because Rāvana is disguised as a brahmin that Sītā is right to do him honour. The story of Draupadi and King Jayaūdratha, on the other hand, demonstrates that kṣatriyas are entitled to such homage when they come to a kṣatriya household (see above, pp.170-6, and below, pp.199–203).</p>
<p>The third verse presents Yama&rsquo;s reply. He begins by admitting that Naciketas is indeed the kind of visitor who is entitled to be called a ‘guest&rsquo;, and honoured accordingly. &lsquo;O brahmin, since you —a guest worthy of honour (namasyaḥ; namaskārārhaḥ, Sankara, Dh.kośa II.iii.p.1391)—have stayed in my house for three days (lit. &ldquo;nights”) without eating, choose in return therefore three wishes.</p>
<p>[[188]]</p>
<p>I bow to you, O brahmin. May all go well with me!&lsquo;49 Sankara explains that each (day and) night that Naciketas has been neglected merits a wish in return (rātrim prati trīn varān; Śankara, Dh.kośa II.iii.p.1391). Tryambaka&rsquo;s closing comment agrees. &lsquo;Appeasing (Naciketas) in this way, he (Yama) presented him with three wishes to remove the sin of having had him stay in his house without eating for three days.&lsquo;50</p>
<p>This leads Tryambaka to his third point: the severe punishment in store for those who neglect the laws of hospitality. He begins with a quotation attributed to the Vedic school of Pārakṣudra (pāraūkṣudraśākhāyām). The text of this name, cited in the Apastamba- śrautasūtra (MW:620), seems to be no longer extant. It was proūbably part of the tradition of the Apastamba school of the Black Yajurveda, to which Tryambaka himself almost certainly belonged (see p.25). The sutras themselves, however, are found elsewhere: in the Taittiriyabrāhmaṇa and the Taittiriyopaniṣad. The quotation runs as follows. &lsquo;He who gives me, that man surely encloses (āvāḥ) me. I, who am food, eat the eater of food. Even before the fire, food burns.&lsquo;51</p>
<p>In the context of the Upanisad, this is the ecstatic chant of the enlightened man for whom the dualities of the phenomenal world are all at once transcended (cf. Śankara on Tait.Up.III.10; Dh. kośa II.ii.pp.740-2). In the context of the Brahmana (according to Sāyaṇa), and very probably in that of the Pārakṣudra too, the lord of food (annasvāmin; Sāy.) himself is talking, the god of the eternal law, that is, of sacrifice (rtasya yajñasya; Say.). According to Sāyaṇa&rsquo;s interpretation, if a man who has faith (yaḥ śraddhaluḥ pumān) gives away to brahmins and so on (brāhmaṇādibhyah prayacchati) me in the form of food (mām annarūpam), then he (sa dātā) encloses (āvāḥ āvṛṇoti) me the god of food (mām anna-</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[189]]</p>
<p>devam), thus making me his own (svikaroti). But if a man, without giving me away (mām adattvā), himself eats (svayam eva atti)- then I, the god of food, eat him (tam&hellip; annadevo &lsquo;ham admi); that is, I cause him to be utterly destroyed (tam vināśayāmi; Sāy. on Tait.Br., Dh.kośa II.i.p.477-8). Sankara, commenting on the Upaniṣad, glosses āvāḥ as &lsquo;he protects&rsquo; (avati). According to Sāyaṇa, the fire of the stomach (udarāgniḥ) &lsquo;burns&rsquo; or digests (dahati pācayati) the food that is eaten for only a day. But the man who eats without giving (adātā tu bhoktā) burns then and there (tadānīm eva dahyate) from the food he is eating (bhujyamānenānnena). &lsquo;Before the fire&rsquo; means &lsquo;before the cremation fire&rsquo;, that is, in this world. For the sin of not feeding others, which is enough to send a man to hell, arises at that very moment (narakahetoḥ pratyavāyasya tadaivotpannatvāt). The image of the cremation fire serves both as an analogy for the sinner&rsquo;s internal burning in this life and as a reminder of the hellūfires to come.</p>
<p>This theme of the punishment threatened by the god of food is continued in Tryambaka&rsquo;s next quotation, taken this time from dharmasastra. Baudh.II.3.5.17 rules that one should never eat without first giving away some food. Verse 18 quotes two ślokas voiced by the god of food (annagītau ślokau). These two slokas, attributed to Baudhāyana, are now presented by Tryambaka.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whoever eats meūthat is, food that has been prepared-withūout giving any to his ancestors, gods, servants, guests and friends, out of delusion, he eats poison: I shall eat him; and I shall be his death. But whoever (first) offers the agnihotra sacrifice, performs the vaiśvadeva ritual, pays homage to his guests, and (only) then contented, pure and having faith-eats me, i.e. what is left after feeding the servants, then for him I become nectar and he enjoys me.52</p>
<p>The earlier threat of internal fires has been replaced by that of death by poison. Both reinforce the rules of hospitality to the guest with powerful magical implications. If the householder behaves as</p>
<p>[[190]]</p>
<p>he ought, the food is transformed into nectar and digests easily. If he does not, it changes within his body and&ndash;as either fire or poison-destroys him. For, as Baudhāyana quotes elsewhere, food is life (annam prāṇam iti; cf. Tait.Br.II.8.8.3) and therefore must be given; it is the highest offering (paramam haviḥ) one can make (Baudh.II.3.6.41).</p>
<p>Before considering the next quotation given by Tryambaka (Sdhp.14r.4-14v.1; see below, note 63), I shall take out of sequence a number of quotations relating to the threats of punishment in store for those who neglect the laws of hospitality. The first two slokas belong to the same passage attributed to Manu (Sdhp. 14v.1-6) from which an earlier out-of-sequence quotation was taken (Sdhp.14v.1-3; note 44). The remaining quotations on this topic are drawn from a passage attributed to the Asvamedhikaparvan of the Mahābhārata (Sdhp. 14v.6-15r.1).</p>
<p>According to the Manu quotations, the danger stems not from the magical properties of food, nor from the vengeful nature of the god of food, but from the supernatural powers of the guest himself. Thus, ‘if a guest leaves one&rsquo;s house with his hopes (for food) dashed, he bequeathes his sins (to his host) and takes away his (host&rsquo;s) merit.&lsquo;53 Or again, ‘if a brahmin stays without being (duly) honūoured, he deprives (his host) of all his good deeds, even if he (i.e. his host, is the kind of brahmin who) gathers (food) by gleaning and who always offers oblations in five fires.&lsquo;54</p>
<p>The assumption here, as earlier, is that the guest in question is a brahmin. Although ‘guests&rsquo; or visitors of other varṇas may be given</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[191]]</p>
<p>food and so on, it seems that the curse of the brahmin guest is what is really feared. It is this fear that constrains Sītā when she is conūfronted by Ravana disguised as a brahmin renouncer. Since he is a guest and a brahmin (brāhmaṇas cātithiś cāyam), Sītā reasons, he has the power to curse her if ignored (anukto hi sapeta mām; Rām. III.47.2). So she offers him homage and hospitality as she ought. Tryambaka returns to this episode below (pp.200–1).</p>
<p>But the power of the guest is not merely that of the brahmin. For even the most superior brahmin will lose all his accumulated merit to a slighted guest. Manu IV.4-5 defines the five means of subsistence open to brahmins in an ideal world. The highest, termed &rsquo;truth&rsquo; (ṛtam), is gleaning corn (unchaśilam); the next, termed &rsquo;nectar&rsquo; (amṛtam), is receiving what is given unasked (ayācitam); the third, termed &lsquo;death&rsquo; (mṛtam), is obtaining food by begging (vācitam); the fourth, termed &lsquo;death-causing&rsquo; (pramṛtam; cf. Manu X.83), is agriculture (karṣaṇam); and the fifth and lowest, termed &rsquo;truth mixed with untruth&rsquo; (satyānṛtam), is trade (vāṇijyam). In Manu&rsquo;s utopian world, even the first three methods of subsistence may be pursued by brahmins in the householder stage, men who have spent a quarter of their lives at the feet of a teacher (cf. Manu IV.1) and who have then deliberately sought out a way of life that will cause as little pain as possible to other beings (adrohenaiva bhūtā- nām alpadroheṇa vā; Manu IV.2). At the top of the hierarchy is the man who stores no food at all but gathers each day what he needs from &lsquo;permitted places&rsquo; (avāritasthāneṣu; Baudh.III.2.14).</p>
<p>But the householder brahmin described here (by both Manu and Tryambaka) is not only one of these. He also offers his morning oblations in five fires: that is, in the aupasana or gṛhya fire used for domestic rituals; in the three srauta fires; and in the sabhya fire kept for general warmth (Mit. on Yajñ.I.221; Har. on Gaut.II. 6.29; Medh. on Manu III.185). Such exemplary brahmins are inūcluded among those whose presence at a meal is held to bless the household (panktipāvana; cf. Gaut.II.6.29; Āp.II.7.17.22; Manu III.185; Yājñ.1.221). Manu&rsquo;s point (and Tryambaka&rsquo;s) is that even so austere a brahmin householder, who has accumulated vast reserves of merit and ascetic power, loses all that merit if he fails to welcome a brahmin guest as he should.</p>
<p>Tryambaka pursues this theme still further in several slokas attributed to the Asvamedhikaparvan. They describe two kinds of</p>
<p>[[192]]</p>
<p>eminent householders who, by virtue of their highly meritorious practices, might be considered immune to the dangers of not welūcoming a guest. In each case, neglect of the guest renders all their previous activities useless.</p>
<p>&lsquo;If a twice-born recites the vedas, the vedāngas and the upāngas each day, but does not pay homage to the guest, he recites in vain. Those who perform the (domestic) sacrifices with cooked food offerings (pākayajña), the (five) great sacrifices, and the (seven) basic forms (samstha) of the soma sacrifice, and (yet) do not honour the guest who has come to their home, then, though they desire fame and wealth, all that they have given away or offered in the sacrifice is rendered vain, killed by (their guest&rsquo;s) killed hope. &lsquo;55 For &lsquo;he who does not pay homage at the end of the vaisvadeva ritual to any guest who has come, at once becomes an outcaste (candāla); there is no doubt about that.&lsquo;56</p>
<p>Pākayajña is defined in the gṛhyasūtras as a domestic sacrifice with cooked offerings (grhyasthālīpāka; Pār.gṛ.I.1.1.). The term is used to distinguish domestic rituals from both srauta and soma sacrifices (e.g. Śānkh.gr.I.1.15; Manu II.143; Gaut.I.8.19–21). According to some authorities, they are of three kinds (e.g. Nār. on Aśv.gr.1.1.2); according to others, four (e.g. Śānkh.gṛ.I.5.1; Pār.gr.I.4.1; Manu II.8.6; Vas.26.10; cf. Gonda 1980:186); acūcording to others again, in line with śrauta and soma rituals, seven (e.g. Gaut.I.8.19-21). The term used for these seven &lsquo;basic forms&rsquo; of the pākayajña, haviryajña and soma rituals is samsthaḥ (see above).</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[193]]</p>
<p>The threat in the last sloka that the householder neglectful of his guest will &lsquo;at once&rsquo; (sadya eva) become a caṇḍāla refers to a &lsquo;visible&rsquo; (drsta) not an otherwordly (adrṣṭa) result (see p.58). That man need not wait to be reborn as a candāla in his next life; he will at once be judged by others to be one. This recalls the point made by Sāyaṇa in his comment on the Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa quotation above (note 51). The &lsquo;visible&rsquo; result of the man who eats without feeding others is that the food burns him then and there (tadānīm eva); he need not wait for the burning of the cremation fire or the flames of hell (Say. on Tait. Br., Dh.kośa II.1.p.477-8).</p>
<p>A final observation should be made concerning these punishūments. Every ruling given by Tryambaka so far has been couched in the masculine, many of them involving terms that cannot be applied (by the modification of gender) to women. I have already discussed the implications of the term dvija (initiation, Vedic education, etc.): by the definition of Tryambaka&rsquo;s day, these canūnot apply to women (see pp.34-9). The same can be said of all the other specific terms describing the householder host: &rsquo;the performer of the agnihotra ritual&rsquo; (hutāgnihotraḥ); &rsquo;the performer of the vaiśvadeva ritual&rsquo; (kṛtavaiśvadevah); &rsquo;the man who offers oblations in five fires&rsquo; (pañcāgnin &hellip; juhvataḥ); the reciter of the vedas, angas and upāngas; the performer of domestic rituals, the five &lsquo;great sacrifices&rsquo; and soma rituals; and so on. Judging from these rulings, we may conclude that the responsibility for the honouring of guests remains that of the male householder, and that the punishūments described will be inflicted on him. We may also assume, however, that the householder&rsquo;s wife, being his assistant in ritual matters, would be considered an accessory to her husband&rsquo;s crime, and punished accordingly.</p>
<p>The last sloka in the group attributed to the Aśvamedhikaparvan turns from the penalties incurred by inhospitality to the rewards in store for the householder who duly honours his guests. In this section, therefore, I have gathered together the quotations relating to this topic. Apart from the sloka attributed to Manu-which belongs to the same passage referred to earlier (Sdhp.14v.1-6; note 44)&ndash;all the quotations are taken in sequence, beginning with the final sloka in the Asvamedhaparvan group.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Whatever one does not offer (lit. &ldquo;feed&rdquo;) to the guest, one should</p>
<p>[[194]]</p>
<p>not eat oneself: paying homage to the guest (in this way) brings one wealth, fame, long life and heaven.&lsquo;57 This ruling recalls Kullūka&rsquo;s interpretation of satkṛtya in Manu III.99: one should take the same care with seasoning, sauces, condiments and so on in relation to the guest&rsquo;s food as one does to one&rsquo;s own (vyañjanādibhiḥ satūkṛtam cānnam, Kull.; see pp. 183-4). Since the wife is responsible for the cooking, this is in effect a ruling for her.</p>
<p>According to a sloka attributed to Sātātapa, the highest heaven is reserved for the householder who honours guests. &lsquo;For the houseūholder cannot by means of either (Vedic) study, (performing) the agnikotra oblation, (offering) sacrifice, or (performing) austerities attain those (heavenly) worlds that are (his simply) as a result of honouring the guest.&lsquo;58 A similar comparison is made in the sloka attributed earlier to Manu. &ldquo;That meritorious reward which one obtains by offering oblations in the fire according to the injunction —just like that, or even better, is the reward (obtained) when the brahmin (guest) is given satisfaction.&lsquo;59 A śloka taken from Bhisma&rsquo;s eulogy of guest-worship in the Anusasanaparvan of the Mahabharata agrees. &lsquo;When a guest is honoured, whatever good he conceives in his mind (concerning his host) cannot be equalled by a hundred sacriūfices, so men say.&lsquo;60 We may again note that the references to Vedic study, sacrifices and so on indicate that the recipient of the reward is assumed to be the male householder. Presumably the devoted wife would be allowed to join her husband in the highest heaven. For she is said to be &lsquo;half her husband&rsquo;s body&rsquo; (sarīrārdham smṛtā) and thus participates equally in both his merit and his</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>sin (punyāpunyaphale samā; Apar.p.111, Bṛhaspati).</p>
<p>[[195]]</p>
<p>There follows a series of slokas on the same subject, all attributed to the conversation between Tārkṣya and Sarasvati in the Āranyakaūparvan of the Mahābhārata (Mbh.III.184.1-25). In the critical edition of the Mahabharata, however, all the slokas are in fact to be found in the appendix to Mbh.III. &lsquo;The superior brahmin (lit. &ldquo;best of twice-born&rdquo;) gives (food) to guests, beings and ancestors and (then) eats the dishes that remain (śiṣṭāny annāni) — what could be better than that? O Indra, there is nothing in the world more wholesome than this: that a man always gives food to guests and then eats of that (which is left). However many morsels of food a twice-born (guest) eats each day, the giver (host) receives the reward of (giving) that many thousands of cows (as sacrificial fee to the priests).&lsquo;61 &lsquo;O excellent Bharata, the reward (obtained) by washing the feet of a learned brahmin (guest) is (equal to) that obtained by giving a reddish-brown cow (cf. Yājñ.I.205) at Jyeṣṭhā lake (a sacred tīrtha; cf. PVK IV.p.759). As long as the ground remains wet from the water (used) for (washing) the feet of the twice-born, the ancestors will drink water from a lotus petal (cup). Welcoming (a guest) pleases the (three śrauta) fires; (offering) a seat (pleases) Indra; washing the feet (pleases) the ancestors; (offering) food (pleases) Prajapati.&lsquo;62</p>
<p>The emphasis on the idea that one should offer food to the guest and then eat what he leaves is a deliberate analogy with the sacrifice. As Tryambaka explains earlier, with regard to his quotation from the Kathopaniṣad (Sdhp.13v.5&lt;Kath. Up.I.7; see above, pp.185-8),</p>
<p>[[196]]</p>
<p>the guest is like fire. Like the sacrificial fire, he consumes the offering. What is left, like prasada, is blessed. According to Manu III.285, one should eat both the residue of the offering to guests (vighasobhuktaśeṣam) and that of the sacrifice (vajñaśeṣam&hellip; amṛtam) every day. For in both &lsquo;sacrifices&rsquo;, food is magically transformed into nectar. A similar idea is to be found in the ruling that a pupil should first offer his alms-food to his teacher and then eat what is left: in this case, the teacher is the deity, the alms-food the sacrificial offering (bhaikṣam haviṣā) and the teacher&rsquo;s stomach the ahavaniya fire (Ap.I.1.3.43-1.1.4.2). Similarly, at meal-times, the wife should offer cooked food to her husband and then eat what he leaves. I shall return to this point below (see ucchista, pp. 221-7).</p>
<p>Tryambaka himself develops this parallel between the fire sacrifice and the homage one should pay to guests. I return here to the original sequence of the treatise followed until half-way through section IIC (see p. 190). Tryambaka quotes at length from &rsquo;the Brahmana quoted by Apastamba&rsquo; (āpastambodāhrtabrāhmaṇam api; that is, Ap.II.3.7.1–11).</p>
<p>Apastamba frequently cites the Brāhmaṇas; more often than not with the phrase iti hi brāhmaṇam (e.g. Āp.I.1.1.10,11; I.1.3.9; I.1.3.26, see below; I.2.7.7,11; athāpi brāhmaṇam, I.3.10.8). In this particular case, the phrase is given in a separate sutra and interpreted by Haradatta as referring to each of the preceding sutras 1-10 (iti brāhmaṇam ity asya sarvena sambandhaḥ; Ujj. on Ap. II.3.7.11). Since sutra 5 is also a quotation (&hellip; iti vijñāyate), Haradatta may have thought it necessary to stipulate that the Brahmana quotation includes sūtras 1 to 5 as well as 6 to 10. Unfortunately, Būhler has been seriously misled by the comment. In his translation of sūtra 11, he takes brahmanam to mean &lsquo;brahmin&rsquo; (masc. acc.) instead of &lsquo;Brāhmana text&rsquo; (neut. nom.). He notes that nine of the thirteen manuscripts used for his edition read iti brāhmaṇam instead of iti hi brāhmaṇam (Āp., Būhler edn., p.64, footnote); and that Haradatta has also dropped the hi. (In the Benares edition, the hi is dropped from both the sutra and the commentary.) The resulting loss of the usual formula for citing the Brāhmaṇa seems to have encouraged Būhler to interpret the phrase otherwise. He translates. &ldquo;Thus (a Brāhmaṇa shall treat) a Brahmana (and a Kshatriya and a Vaisya their caste-fellows).&rsquo; He has evidently taken Haradatta&rsquo;s sarvena</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[197]]</p>
<p>sambandhaḥ to mean &lsquo;referring to each person&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;referring to each sūtra&rsquo;. To make sense of this translation, we must assume the verb and general construction of sūtras 12 (rājānam ced atithir abhyagacchet&hellip;) and 13 (āhitāgnim ced atithir abhyagacchet&hellip;). According to Būhler&rsquo;s interpretation, therefore, we have a threefold distinction: the behaviour of a brahmin (sūtras 1-11); that of a king (sūtra 12); and that of an agnihotrin (sūtra 13).</p>
<p>But this is both unnecessary and wrong. For one thing, the agniūhotrin is a brahmin. For another, unlike sūtras 12 and 13, the precedūing group does not in fact describe the behaviour of the host at all. As Tryambaka&rsquo;s extract demonstrates, sutras 1-11 spell out the symbolic correspondences in operation during the ritual of atithiūpūjā, whoever is acting as host. Sūtras 12 and 13 distinguish between the two most likely categories of host: the kṣatriya, exemplified here by the king (rājābhiṣiktah kṣatriyo &lsquo;sav ..; Ujj.); and the brahmin, exemplified here by the agnihotrin. A further problem with Būhler&rsquo;s interpretation is his translation of brāhmanam to include not only the brahmin guest but the kṣatriya and vaisya as well. For while the term dvija (&rsquo;twice-born&rsquo;) often denotes the brahmin alone (e.g. Rām.III.46.32b-35 &lt; Sdhp.15v.3-8; see note 69 below), the term brāhmaṇa never denotes all the twice-born</p>
<p>varnas.</p>
<p>The passage reads as follows. &lsquo;That same (homage to guests; or &ldquo;sacrifice to men”, manuṣyayajñaḥ, Ujj.) is a (śrauta) sacrifice eternally performed by the householder to Prajapati. The fire of the guest (his digestive fire; jatharo &lsquo;gnih, Ujj.) is the āhavanīya fire. The fire in the household (the domestic fire; grhe &lsquo;gnir aupāsanaḥ, Ujj.) is the garhapatya fire. The fire in which the cooking is done (the ordinary fire; laukikāgniḥ, Ujj.) is the fire for cooking the sacriūficial offering (the dakṣinagni, Ujj.). If a man eats before his guest (has eaten), then he devours (destroys) the nourishment, prosūperity, offspring, cattle, sacrifices and good works of the household. Food that is mixed with milk (paya upasecanam yasya tad annam; Ujj.) (and offered to the guest) corresponds to the agnistoma sacriūfice; that mixed with ghee to the ukthya sacrifice; that mixed with honey to the atirātra sacrifice; that mixed with meat to the dvadasa sacrifice; that mixed with water brings fame and an increase in progeny. It is recognized (by the authorities) that both the guests one likes and those one dislikes enable one to go to the heavenly world. When one gives (food to guests) in the morning, at midday,</p>
<p>[[198]]</p>
<p>and in the evening, these (three rituals) become the (three) pressings of soma. When one rises after (the guest himself has risen to go; yad gantum uttiṣṭham anutisthati, Ujj.), that is the ritual of leaving the place of sacrifice. When one addresses (the guest) kindly, (i.e. when one performs the ritual of) praise, that is the sacrificial fee. When one takes one&rsquo;s leave (of a guest; i.e. follows him out as a mark of respect; anuvrajanam, Ujj.), his steps are the visnukramāḥ (the steps taken by the sacrificer between the altar and the ahavanīya fire). When one comes back (into the house afterwards), that is the purificatory bath (marking the end of the sacrifice). Thus declares the Brāhmaṇa text.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the rituals named are types of soma sacrifice. I have discussed above how frequently echoes of Vedic sacrifice reappear in later rituals (see pp.102-7, pp.176-8). In this example, as in that of the internalization of the sacrifice (prānāgnihotra), those echoes are deliberately sought and stressed. The purpose, and the result, is to bestow on the ritual homage to the guest the grandeur, sanctity and authority of Vedic sacrifice. By extension, therefore, the role of the wife in this apparently domestic ritual is raised to the level of the dharmapatni in the śrauta sacrifice. As we have seen, no higher religious office is open to her.</p>
<p>This brings us to the central issue under discussion: the role of the wife in the ritual homage to the guest.</p>
<p>I shall begin with a point raised by Tryambaka considerably earlier, in the context of the vais vadeva ritual (see pp.180-3). For it is the wife&rsquo;s duty &rsquo;to prepare the food for the vaisvadeva ritual, for the homage to guests and so on.&lsquo;64 Tryambaka&rsquo;s evidence</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[199]]</p>
<p>for this ruling-given in his section on the vaiśvadeva ritual but, for reasons of consistency, dealt with here-is taken from the chapter in the Visnupurana describing the conversation between the seer, Ṛbhu, and his pupil, Nidāgha (ṛbhunidāghasamvāda). When Rbhu comes to Nidāgha&rsquo;s house as a guest, Nidāgha instructs his wife, Śālinī, as follows. ““O Śālinī, using all the most exquisite delicacies to be found in my house, prepare food for him.&rdquo; Instructed in this way by him (Nidāgha), his wife prepared that food which is (considered) wholesome (i.e. acceptable) for a brahmin (lit. “twiceūborn&rdquo;); (and she did this) because of the authority of a husband&rsquo;s command.&lsquo;65</p>
<p>Several points already raised may be reaffirmed here. The term patnī reinforces the parallel with the Vedic sacrifice and the imūportance of the wife&rsquo;s role as sacrificer&rsquo;s assistant (section IIB, pp. 107-15). The instruction detailing the culinary preparations recalls Kulluka&rsquo;s ruling concerning the care that should be taken with the guest&rsquo;s food (see pp.183–5), and the fact that one should not eat oneself what one does not offer the guest (see pp.193–6). Finally, although the wife is responsible for the actual preparation of the food, the reference to her husband&rsquo;s &lsquo;command&rsquo; indicates under whose authority she functions. This in turn recalls earlier pronouncements concerning punishments and rewards consequent upon this ritual: the ultimate responsibility rests with him (see pp.185-8, 193-6).</p>
<p>Returning to Tryambaka&rsquo;s section on atithipūjā, and back in sequence once more, the next point concerns the presence of the wife. When the husband is present, it is his responsibility; when he is absent, his wife should act on his behalf. As Tryambaka explains, &lsquo;if the husband has gone away, any guest who comes (to the house) should be honoured by his wife (patnī) instead. &lsquo;66 &lsquo;(This is so) because it has been established that the presence of a wife in the house is necessary for the (offering of) food to a guest, as is indicated in Manu&rsquo;s statement that &ldquo;one should recognize (as a guest) one</p>
<p>10-15v.1.</p>
<p>[[200]]</p>
<p>who has come to a house where there is both a wife and the (three) fires.&quot;&lsquo;67</p>
<p>In fact, the half-sloka quoted here by Tryambaka (Manu III.103b) must be taken together with Manu III.102 and 103a to make comūplete sense. Verse 102 defines the term &lsquo;guest&rsquo; (atithi): a brahmin who stays for one night (ekarātram tu nivasan &hellip; brāhmaṇaḥ). Verse 103 expands upon this. One should not recognize (na, III.103a; vidyāt, III.103b) the following people as guests: a brahmin who lives in the same village, or one who is making a social or business call (naikagrāmīnam atithim vipram sāmgatikam tathā; III. 103a), even if he has come to a house where there is a wife and the sacred fires (III.103b). The implication of the half-sloka is now clear: the house in which the guest may be properly honoured is that of the agnihotrin in which the three śrauta fires are worshipped; and in which the (chief) wife is present. This recalls the very similar rulings concerning the importance of the patnī at the fire ritual. There as here, the husband may be absent but not the wife (see section IIB, pp. 132-41).</p>
<p>Tryambaka draws his evidence for this ruling from the two episodes cited earlier in relation to whether or not the good wife should talk to a man who is not related to her (see pp.170–6): Sita&rsquo;s meeting with Rāvaṇa, and Draupadi&rsquo;s with Jayadratha. He begins with the first incident. As he explains, &lsquo;it is because of this (ruling; ata eva) that it is said in the Ramayana that Sītā paid homage to Rāvana when he came to her in the guise of a brahmin, even though Rāma was away (at the time). &lsquo;68 The quotation reads as follows.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now when she saw Rāvana, who had come in the guise of a brahmin, Maithili (Sītā) honoured him with all the attentions (traditionally enjoined) for a guest. First, she brought him a seat (āsana; usually a low wooden seat, see pp.183-4; but see also bṛsī below) and invited him (to sit) with (the offer of) water to wash his feet. Then she said to that seemingly gentle man, &ldquo;It is ready.&rdquo; Seeing that he had come in the guise of a twice-born, that he 67. upasthitam grhe vidyad bhārya yatrāgnayo &lsquo;pi va (Sdhp.15v.1, Manu &lt; Manu III.103b) iti manuvacanenātithibhojanasya gṛhe bhāryasatve niyatatvaūpratipādanād iti // Sdhp.15v.1-2.</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[201]]</p>
<p>was carrying an alms-bowl and water-pot, and that it was imposūsible to find a way of avoiding him, the woman Maithili invited him as (one usually invites) a brahmin. &ldquo;Here is a cushion (bṛsi), O brahmin: sit if you will. And here is water for washing your feet: please accept it. And here, prepared (especially) for you, is the best forest produce: may you eat here undisturbed.&rdquo; &lsquo;67</p>
<p>Two things persuade Sītā to treat Rāvana as she would an honoured guest. First, he looks like a brahmin. The term &rsquo;twiceūborn&rsquo; (dvija, dvijāti) is repeatedly assumed here to be synonymous with ‘brahmin&rsquo; (brāhmaṇavat, brāhmaṇa). Secondly, he looks like an ascetic (parivrājakarupeṇa, Ram.III.46.4; parivrājakalingena, Rām.III.47.1); that is, he carries the alms-bowl and the water-pot that are the outward signs of the ascetic (cf. Manu VI.52; Baudh.II. 10.17.11; Yajñ.III.58,60). The &lsquo;attentions&rsquo; (satkāraiḥ; cf. satkṛtya, p.184), that Sītā offers him are thus appropriate both to her own forest existence and to the apparent asceticism of the recipient. Manu, for example, rules that forest hermits should live off the produce of the forest (vanyam; Manu VI.12), vegetables, flowers, roots and fruits (śākāni puṣpamūlaphalāni ca; Manu VI.13). Indeed, a brahmin ascetic should ideally receive alms from twiceūborn householders who also live in the forest (gṛhamedhiṣu canyeṣu dvijeṣu vanavāsiṣu; Manu VI.27). Moreover, the &lsquo;cushion&rsquo; (bṛsi) that Sita offers Ravana is the special bundle of cloth or grass conūsidered appropriate to the ascetic (&lsquo;Wulst, Bausch von gewundenem Gras u.s.w.&rsquo;, Böhtlingk and Roth).</p>
<p>The earlier lengthy quotation concerning Draupadi and Jayaūdratha&rsquo;s messenger, Kotikāśya, was taken from Mbh.III.250 (see pp.173-5). In this section, the extract is from the following chapter.</p>
<p>[[202]]</p>
<p>After receiving Kotikasya&rsquo;s report, Jayadratha decides to pay Draupadi a visit. Draupadi&rsquo;s response is to show him the respect due to the guest. Her formal invitation forms Tryambaka&rsquo;s next quotation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O son of a king, accept this water for washing your feet and this (wooden) seat. Let me give you your morning meal - fifty deer (if you like)! Kunti&rsquo;s son, Yudhisthira, will himself (i.e on his return) present you with black antelopes, spotted deer, nyaňku deer, tawny deer, sarabha deer, sasa deer, nilgai, ruru deer, sambara deer, gayal, and many (other) kinds of deer (mṛga), (as well as) wild boar, wild buffalo and whatever other wild animals (mṛgajātī) there are.&lsquo;70</p>
<p>I have taken the term mṛga on its own to denote the various species of deer-at least fifty, according to Draupadi-and mṛgajāti (fem. pl.) to indicate the other kinds of wild animals. For this reason, although sasa can mean either a rabbit or a species of deer (and although van Buitenen prefers the former), I have assumed the latter. For the same reason, and also because bears are not normally considered appropriate food, I have amended the reading in T, (rkṣān) to that in the critical edition of the Mahaūbhārata (ṛśyān). The latter term denotes the painted or white-footed antelope, commonly called &rsquo;nilgai&rsquo;. The term gavayān denotes the species of wild cattle called &lsquo;gayal&rsquo; which is traditionally classed as a kind of deer. It is also often confused with the &lsquo;cow-deer&rsquo; (gomrga; translated as &lsquo;gayal&rsquo; by Keith 1914:144; see also Colebrooke 1805), which is included among the sacrificial victims of the aśvamedha (Śat.Br.XIII.2.2.2) and equated elsewhere with cattle (Śat.Br.XIII. 3.4.3). According to Sayana, the gomṛga is a cross between a deer and a bull (Sāy. on Tait.Sam.II.1.10.2). There seems to be good reason, however, to suggest that the nilgai, gayal and gomrga are in fact three quite different animals (see Colebrooke 1805; Eggeling 1978:V,338-9, note 1).</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[203]]</p>
<p>While Sita&rsquo;s offering of fruit and vegetables is appropriate for the brahmin ascetic, Draupadi&rsquo;s offering of a splendid selection of meat dishes is equally appropriate for a kṣatriya king. (Before their exile, Draupadi supervised the daily feeding of eight thousand brahmins off golden plates; see Sdhp.29v.10–30r.3&lt;Mbh.III.222. 40-3; from section IV, pp.280-1). The other formalities are the same, as is the requirement that the ideal wife obeys the rules of hospitality even when she suspects that her &lsquo;guest&rsquo; is a rogue. In both cases, obedience far outweighs commonsense.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s final point regarding the role of the wife in offering hospitality concerns her treatment of the Vedic student. &lsquo;Because of the smrti statement that it is a sin not to give, women must give alms to Vedic students (brahmacāribhyoh) who come (to the house to beg) for alms.&lsquo;71 Tryambaka&rsquo;s evidence for this is taken from Apastamba&rsquo;s section on Vedic studentship. The concluding phrase iti hi brāhmaṇam, not given here by Tryambaka, again indicates a quotation from a Brāhmaṇa text (cf. above, pp. 196-7).</p>
<p>According to Apastamba, ‘if women refuse to give alms to a Vedic student whose mind is concentrated (samāhit[ah]), then he will snatch away the (religious merit they have obtained by) srauta sacrifice (vāgair arjitam dharmam; Ujj.), religious donation (dānūenārjitam; Ujj.), oblation (into the domestic fire; darvihomair gārhyair arjitam, Ujj.), (as well as their) offspring, cattle, the glory of sacred learning (brahmavarcasam), and food. That is why the wandering order of Vedic students should never be refused (alms).&lsquo;72 The last clause, omitted here by Tryambaka, explains that, amongst those students who come to beg at the house, there may well be one who would put that threat into practice (evamvidhi evamvrataḥ).</p>
<p>Two points may be made here. First, this is the only occasion in Tryambaka&rsquo;s treatment of atithipūjā — apart from the ruling that the wife should act on her husband&rsquo;s behalf when he is away (see notes 66 and 67)—when the injunction is applied specifically to women (strīṇām). Usually, the ruling is either given in the masculine</p>
<p>[[204]]</p>
<p>(e.g. yo mā dadāti; yo datvā; etc.) or applied directly to the male householder (e.g. dvijaḥ, gṛhī, etc.). Despite the fact that the wife&rsquo;s presence is more important than that of her husband, and that she will actually prepare and serve the food, the ruling is invariably aimed at the husband. Moreover, the reward for obedience and the punishment for disobedience are, as we.have seen, both explained in terms of the husband&rsquo;s gain or loss (see pp.188-93, 193–6). The wife&rsquo;s part in all this must be read between the lines. In dharma- śāstra literature in general, however, the rulings relating to giving alms to the Vedic student are consistently couched in the feminine.</p>
<p>For example, when the student goes on his begging round in the village, he is almost always advised to apply first to one or more women (those who will not refuse, Par.gr.II.5.5-6, Śānkh.gr.II. 6.6; to his mother, Par.gr.II.5.6, Śārikh.gr.II.6.5; or to any female relative who will not refuse, Manu II.50; cf. Aśv.gr.I.22.7). The formula he should use when he begs almost always assumes that he is talking to a woman, the position of the honorific vocative bhavati depending on the varna of the woman addressed (Par.gr.II.5.2-4; Ap.I.1.3.28-30; Manu II.49; see also Wujastyk 1981:34; but cf. Aśv.gr.I.22.8). The distinction between the man&rsquo;s responsibility for the ritual homage of the guest and the woman&rsquo;s responsibility to give alms to the student demonstrates that while the former is a &lsquo;great sacrifice&rsquo; (mahāyajña; see pp.176-8), the latter is not. It seems fitting too that the real Vedic student should beg from the householder&rsquo;s wife, who is traditionally described as a quasiūstudent in her husband-guru&rsquo;s home (Manu II.67&lt;Sdhp.2r.8-9; see section I, p.35, note 16).</p>
<p>The second point concerns the things that the student may &lsquo;snatch away&rsquo; from the ungenerous wife. This is not the usual formula of &lsquo;reputation, prosperity and long life&rsquo; but a specific list of religious practices or goals. What is interesting is that Tryambaka himself takes the orthodox line that a woman cannot offer either śrauta or gṛhya sacrifices (section IIB, pp.107-15) or make religiūous donations in her own right (see section IV, pp.277–80). He does not discuss the question of children, but the orthodox view is that they belong to the husband for he owns both &lsquo;seed&rsquo; and &lsquo;field&rsquo; (e.g. Manu IX.32-3, 35–7; cf. section IV, pp. 300-2). The threat to cattle is to property that Tryambaka maintains is owned by the wife jointly with the rest of the household, although she has no</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>right to dispose of it (see section IV, pp.277-80).</p>
<p>[[205]]</p>
<p>The threat to the wife&rsquo;s &lsquo;sacred learning&rsquo; is the most curious of all. For while the wife may be said to act ‘jointly&rsquo; with her husband in matters relating to religious rituals, donations, property and children—and thus that the rewards accrue to both of them— this cannot be said of Vedic learning. In the Taittiriyopaniṣad, &rsquo;the glory of sacred learning&rsquo; (brahmavarcasam) — together with offūspring, cattle and fame—is the goal and reward of the enlightened man (Tait.Up.III.6,7,8,9,10). In dharmaśāstra, the same phrase is used specifically in contexts relating to Vedic studentship. Manu II.37, for example, rules that if a brahmin boy desires this goal (brahmavarcasakāmasya), he should be initiated in his fifth year. Kullūka glosses the term as &rsquo;the ascetic power made brilliant by such things as knowing how to recite the Veda and knowing what it means&rsquo; (vedadhyayanatadarthajñānādiprakarṣakrtam tejas). Acūcording to the orthodox view, this may apply to a woman&rsquo;s husband or to her son, but never to herself. We seem to have three options here. We could assume that the ruling dates from an earlier age when women did have access to Vedic study. Or we could reinterpret the phrase in terms of &lsquo;domestic glory&rsquo; (cf. Sankara&rsquo;s gloss on panditā, discussed in section I, p. 38). Or we could take more literally the maxim that &lsquo;husband and wife are one&rsquo; (yo bharta sa smṛtānganā; Manu IX.45), assume their complete identification in matters of religious achievement and merit (yataś ca dampatyor aikyamataḥ; Kull.), and interpret all the threats accordingly.</p>
<p>Tryambaka concludes his treatment of atithipūjā by distinguishing between the &lsquo;guest&rsquo; (atithi) proper and other casual visitors. For, as he explains, ‘after the vaiśvadeva ritual, homage should be paid by offering such things as food, as one would to a guest, to other visitors and so on.&lsquo;73 Any visitor to an Indian home today will find that this is still the case.</p>
<p>Tryambaka quotes Vyasa. &lsquo;At the appropriate time, the wifeūthat is, the female head of the household (gṛhamukhi)—should always be attentive in (offering) seats, food and gifts, in paying</p>
<p>[[206]]</p>
<p>respect and speaking pleasantly, as is fitting and in accordance with their merits, to (each of the following people): one&rsquo;s elders (or those who are worthy of respect; cf. pp.156-7), the friends of one&rsquo;s son(s), one&rsquo;s relations, the labourers one supports, those one has invited, any male or female slaves (dāsīdāsajanasya), both guests (proper) and (ordinary) visitors, and those religious mendicants who wear a sectarian mark (bhikṣukānām ca linginām).’74</p>
<p>We may note several things here. First, the ruling is aimed at the &lsquo;female head of the household&rsquo; (grhamukhi), that is, to the senior wife of the male head of the household (whether or not the customs of polygamy and the joint family are in operation). Secondly, the wife&rsquo;s responsibility covers not only the offering of food and so on but also the observation of the correct order of rank or merit (cf. Vas.XI.6). The distinction between ordinary dependent labourers and slaves (or perhaps sudra servants) is interesting. The reference to religious mendicants as a separate category from &lsquo;guests&rsquo; reinūforces my remarks above concerning the Vedic student who comes to beg for alms (pp.203–5). Manu III.94 also distinguishes between the &lsquo;guest&rsquo; (atithi) on the one hand and the ascetic (bhikṣave; parivrāje, Kull.) and the student (brahmacārine; prathamāśramiṇe, Kull.) on the other. Both the ascetic and the student are entitled to receive food and so on, but neither should be termed &lsquo;guests&rsquo;.</p>
<p>This is not for lack of respect. The renouncer in particular is accorded enormous respect by householders. For example, Haraūdatta on Āp.II.2.4.10, indicates that some food should be set aside as alms before one even attends to one&rsquo;s guests. According to Par. Sm.I.51, one must perform the candrayana penance if one fails to give alms to the student and the ascetic before one eats oneself. Even in the twentieth century, a pious woman on a student&rsquo;s regular begging round will not eat until the student has come for his share (Wujastyk 1981:34). But it is customary for a genuine religious mendicant to disturb a household as little as possible; to come when the cooking is done, when the meal is finished, and even the remains have been cleared away (Manu VI.56; Vas.X.8); certainly never to</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[207]]</p>
<p>sit down to a formal meal (cf. Olivelle 1977:47-8). Food is no longer of great importance to him. Nonetheless, as Tryambaka explains in his section on general behaviour, the ideal wife never eats before she has distributed food to gods, ancestors, guests, servants, cows and the company of religious mendicants (bhikṣukuleṣu, Sdhp. 23r.10-23v.1; from section IV, pp.273-4). The reference to a secūtarian mark (cf. section IIA, pp.99-100), deliberately excludes mendicants belonging to non-Hindu sects. Buddhist and Jain monks, for example, and others like them, should not be fed at all by the orthodox Hindu.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Tryambaka does not in fact define the term &lsquo;guest&rsquo; (atithi). The definitions in other texts are various. According to the Aitareyaranyaka, for example, if one attains excellence&rsquo; (śrestatām aśnute) one is a guest; if not, then one is not worthy of hospitality (Ait. Ār.I.1.1). The Rāmāyana episode regarding Sītā and Rāvana assumes a definition that does not exclude the religious mendicant. In the Kathopanisad, the term seems to cover any brahmin who has arrived unexpectedly. Later authorities rule that a brahmin should not treat a man of lower caste as a &lsquo;guest&rsquo; (Gaut.I. 1.39; Manu III.110–12; Āp.II.2.4.18-20). According to Parāśara, the term denotes someone, not from one&rsquo;s own village, who does not stay long (anityam āgataḥ, Par.Sm.1.42; cf. Gaut.I.5.36). Mādhava comments that all those who move on before the day is over (tithipurvotsavāḥ sarve) may be called &lsquo;guests&rsquo;; the rest are merely &lsquo;visitors&rsquo; (seṣān abhyāgatān; Par.M.I.i.p.p.398, Yama). As noted above, Manu excludes anyone who is from the same village or on a social or business call (Manu III.103; Par.M.I.i.p.398-9). The previous verse defines the guest as a brahmin who stays for only one night, and derives the term accordingly (anityam hi sthito yasmāt tasmād atithir ucyate; Manu III.102). In the Visnupurana, the term denotes one whose family is not known (ajñātakulanāmānam), who is destitute (akiñcanam), unrelated to oneself (asambandham), or from another country (anyadesāt samāgatam; Vis.P.III.11. 59-60; cf. Par.M.I.p.398). The Mārkandeyapurāna excludes friends (mitram; cf. Manu III.110,113), defining the guest as a brahmin who arrives hungry (bubhukṣum), tired (śrāntam) or begging (vācamānam; Mārk.P.29.26-8; Par.M.I.i.p.399). The last of these conflicts with the rulings given earlier classing mendicants and Vedic students as &rsquo;non-guests&rsquo;, but agrees with the Rāmāyaṇa episode.</p>
<p>[[208]]</p>
<p>Tryambaka next considers the order in which &lsquo;guests&rsquo; and &lsquo;visitors&rsquo; should be made welcome. According to Apastamba, &rsquo;the feeding of guests comes first.&ldquo;75 The quotation runs as follows. ‘One should feed guests first of all; then children, the old, the sick and any pregnant woman ([a]ntarvatniḥ; but see Ujj. below). The two owners (of the house) should not refuse anyone who asks for food at the (appropriate) time.&lsquo;76 The last sutra is also quoted at the beginning of this section on atithipūjā (see above, note 43).</p>
<p>To explain these rulings further, Tryambaka quotes at length from the Ujjvalā, Haradatta&rsquo;s commentary on the Apastambadharmaūsūtra. &ldquo;The term &ldquo;guests&rdquo; he (Apastamba) will explain (later). One should feed them first of all. One should not eat either with them or before them. And those children who are living in one&rsquo;s house one should also feed first (i.e. before oneself). Since the term antarvatnī (&ldquo;pregnant woman&rdquo;) is complete in itself (siddha), the word strī (“woman”) is meant to indicate sisters and so on as well. The use of the term antarvatni means that she (the pregnant woman) should always be honoured (in this way). &ldquo;At the (appropriate) time” means at the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual; that is, at the end of it. The two owners (svāminau), that is, the master and mistress of the house (gṛhapatī), should not refuse anyone who has come there hoping for food. Something should definitely be given to him.&lsquo;77</p>
<p>Tryambaka concludes the commentary himself. ‘(This is so) because it says in the Mahābhārata, “she who gives food at the (appropriate) time&rdquo;. &ldquo;Children, the old and the sick&rdquo; means</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[209]]</p>
<p>&ldquo;everyone&rdquo;. Therefore what is needed (food, etc.) should be given to whoever (comes) at whatever time (he comes).&lsquo;78</p>
<p>Several points are worth noting here. First, it is interesting that not only important guests and casual visitors but also dependants such as children, the old and the sick should be fed before the master of the house. Even more remarkable is Haradatta&rsquo;s suggestion that women such as &lsquo;sisters and so on&rsquo; should be fed before him. Howūever, if we compare similar rulings in Manu III.114, Vas.XI.7 and Baudh.II.7.13.5, we find some agreement with Haradatta&rsquo;s interūpretation. Manu, for example, suggests that, even before one&rsquo;s guests, one should feed suvasinih, as well as children, the sick, and pregnant women (garbhinih). In this context, the term suvāsinī means &lsquo;a woman who lives in a good or comfortable house&rsquo;, and usually denotes the daughter, whether married or not, who lives in her father&rsquo;s house (cf. Medh. on Manu III.114). Both Sarvaūjñanārāyaṇa and Nandana read svavasiniḥ and take it to mean &lsquo;sisters&rsquo;. Vas.XI.7 rules that, after feeding one&rsquo;s guests, one should feed the following members of one&rsquo;s own family (svagṛhyāṇām): the unmarried girls (kumāri), the children (bāla), the old, the adolescent boys (taruna&rsquo;) and the pradātāḥ. Unable to translate the last term, Būhler retains it while suggesting that it denotes ‘a class of female relatives&rsquo;. The Calcutta edition amends it to praūbhṛtin (&lsquo;dependants&rsquo;), while Fūhrer&rsquo;s edition reads prajātāḥ (&lsquo;women who have given birth&rsquo;; Būhler 1965:50, note 7). Baudhāyana&rsquo;s ruling simply lists &lsquo;guests, pregnant women, children, the old, the wretched and the sick&rsquo;, and makes no mention of other women at all.</p>
<p>Certainly, the custom in the more traditional homes today is for the women to eat only after their menfolk, guests and children have been served. However, it is also a widespread custom for the pregnant woman to return to her parents&rsquo; home to deliver her child. In this case, the pregnant woman would also be the daughter or sister of the household. Haradatta&rsquo;s &lsquo;sisters and so on&rsquo; would therefore include the unmarried and therefore very young girls, the married daughters on a visit home, pregnant women and those who have recently delivered a child. It would not include the wives of the</p>
<p>[[210]]</p>
<p>male members of the household. In view of the importance of children and other rulings on pregnancy, the special treatment of the pregnant woman is not surprising (cf. section IV, pp.289-90). Finally, Tryambaka&rsquo;s last rather sweeping comment seems to render unnecessary most of the careful rulings he has made so far.</p>
<p>The final (unattributed) quotation in this section is attributed to the Anusāsanaparvan of the Mahabharata in section IV. &lsquo;The woman who provides food for weak, helpless, wretched, blind and poverty-stricken brahmins is (rightly called) &ldquo;one who participates in the religious observances of her husband (pativratabhāginī).”78</p>
<p>This quotation reinforces two major points concerning atithiūpūjā. First, it emphasizes the importance of the brahmin recipient of food and homage. As we have seen, the brahmin is the ideal guest for kṣatriya households (such as those in court circles) and, acūcording to some, the only guest acceptable to the brahmin host. Secondly, the wife&rsquo;s tasks of preparing food, welcoming the guest, speaking pleasantly and serving him are all seen as her duty towards her husband&rsquo;s religious commitments rather than her own. In her role of ritual assistant, the wife&rsquo;s religious duty is to assist her husband in his (pativratabhāginī; cf. pp.50, 107–15, 281–2).</p>
<p>At meals (bhojanam; Sdhp.16v.8-19r.9)</p>
<p>Tryambaka next describes the duties of the wife that relate to eating (plates 6-9). This is an important topic in dharmasastra for, acūcording to Manu V.4, mistakes in this sphere (annadoṣāt) are among the four main causes of death to brahmins. (The others are lack of Vedic study, failure to perform the appropriate actions, and laziūness.) In fact, Tryambaka&rsquo;s presentation is by no means as elaborate as one might expect. His rulings may be divided into six categories: the wife&rsquo;s duty to serve at meals; the requirement that she should not be present when her husband eats; how she should serve the food; her own meal; her offering to the goddess Jyesthā; and, lastly, her post-prandial obligations such as clearing up and offering betel.</p>
<p>Tryambaka begins with the statement that the religious duty of</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[211]]</p>
<p>women also includes serving at meals (pariveṣaṇam).80 Four quotations follow: the first indicates the duty of the wife to serve food to brahmins; the remaining three describe her duty to serve at her husband&rsquo;s meal (see plate 7).</p>
<p>The story of Uttaṅka,81 from the Adiparvan of the Mahābhārata, is a curious one and Tryambaka quotes only what he needs. Uttaňka is a student living in the house of his brahmin teacher, Veda. When Veda has to go away for a time, he asks his pupil to take his place (yat kimcid asmadgṛhe parihiyate tad icchamy aham aparihiṇam bhavatā kriyamānam iti; Mbh.I.3.86). During Veda&rsquo;s absence, however, his senior wife (upadhyāyini; see below) comes into her &lsquo;season&rsquo; (ṛtumatī; that is, she enters the period after menstruation when husband and wife should make love). The other women (strībhih) instruct Uttaṅka to substitute for Veda in this matter also (Mbh.I.3.89). Uttaṅka refuses on the grounds that intercourse with one&rsquo;s teacher&rsquo;s wife is forbidden (akāryam); and Veda&rsquo;s orders do not include wrong-doing (Mbh.1.3.90). When Veda returns, he rewards Uttanka by granting him leave to go (i.e. his period of studentship is deemed to have been successfully completed). But when Uttanka asks to give the traditional thanks-offering (gurvūartham; Mbh.I.3.95), Veda cannot decide what he wants. He sends Uttanka to his wife instead; and his pupil repeats the question to her (Mbh.I.3.98-9). Tryambaka&rsquo;s quotation contains her response.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Addressed in this way, the teacher&rsquo;s wife answered Uttanka. &ldquo;Go to Pausya. Beg from him the earrings worn by his kṣatriyā wife, and bring them (to me). In four days, there will be a religious ceremony, and I wish to serve food to the brahmins wearing those earrings. On that day, I shall make myself beautiful with those earrings. May good fortune be yours-(go and) beg!&quot;&lsquo;82</p>
<p>[[212]]</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s point is that if brahmins are to be fed, then the host&rsquo;s chief wife should serve them. We may note two further points. First, the story is an interesting demonstration of a conflict of duties: the student&rsquo;s duty to obey his teacher to the letter; the prohibition on intercourse with one&rsquo;s teacher&rsquo;s wife (one of the five mahāpātakas or &lsquo;great sins&rsquo;; cf. pp.219-20); and the duty not to let a woman&rsquo;s &lsquo;season&rsquo; (rtu) pass neglected (ṛtukāladharmaḥ; section IV, pp.287-8). Uttanka solves his problem by weighing the opinions of the women (strīṇām vacanam) against the unspoken intentions of his teacher; not surprisingly, the latter prevails. In the final section of his treatise, Tryambaka discusses the question of women caught in similar conflicts. His advice is predictable: the wife&rsquo;s first duty is to obey her husband even when this conflicts with other duties (itaradharmopamardenāpi; see section V, pp.308-9), even when it involves uoing something that is normally considered wrong (akaryakarane &lsquo;pi; section V, pp.309-12). In Tryambaka&rsquo;s view, therefore, Veda&rsquo;s wife is in the wrong: her duty to obey her husūband&rsquo;s wishes should outweigh the urgency of the ṛtu. All the more surprising perhaps that Tryambaka refers to the episode at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, the terms kṣatriya and upādhyāyinī (or, more commonūly, upadhyāyānī; see Mbh.1.3.100, variant reading) are of more than grammatical interest. Pāṇ.IV.1.4 (ajādy ataṣ tāp) rules that nominal stems in a form feminines in -a. Thus sudra (&lsquo;a sudra man&rsquo;) beūcomes sūdrā (&lsquo;a sudra woman&rsquo;; Kāś.); kṣatriya (&lsquo;a kṣatriya man&rsquo;) becomes kṣatriyā (a kṣatriya woman&rsquo;); upādhyāya (‘a male teacher&rsquo;) becomes upadhyāyā (&lsquo;a female teacher&rsquo;; Katy. on Pan.III.3.21); ācārya (‘a male teacher&rsquo;) becomes ācāryā (&lsquo;a female teacher&rsquo;). Pāṇ.IV.1.48 (pumyogad akhyāyām) rules that the suffix -7 indicates the wife in relation to her husband. Thus sūdra (a śūdra man&rsquo;) becomes sūdrī (&rsquo;the wife of a sūdra man&rsquo;; Kāś. on Pān.IV.1.4). Similarly, gaṇaka (‘a male astrologer&rsquo;) becomes either gaṇakā (‘a female astrologer&rsquo;) or gaṇaki (&lsquo;an astrologer&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;; ganakasya strī gaṇakī, Kāś. on Pan.IV.1.48), depending on who has the knowledge of astrology. Other examples cited by the Kāsikā include mahā- mātrī (&rsquo;the wife of a chief minister&rsquo;) and praṣthī (&rsquo;the wife of a chief”).</p>
<p>bhikṣaṇam kurvata iti // Sdhp.16v.8–17r.2 (Mbh.)&lt;Mbh.I.3.100 (pratyuvāca for uvāca; pausyam rājānam for pausyam; ye and staḥ omitted; anayas va for anayasveti; sobhamānā for sobhayamānā; mām omitted; sampadayasva for sampādayāmi; kṣaṇam for bhikṣaṇam). N.B. variant readings give both upādhyāyānī and upādhyāyi..</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[213]]</p>
<p>Such words apply to the woman because of her relationship with her husband (pumyogād ete sabdaḥ striyām vartante), and not because she possesses that same quality herself (na tu pumāmsamācakṣate; Kāś. on Pāṇ.IV.1.48). Pāṇ.IV.1.49 (°ācāryāṇam ānuk) rules that certain words such as ācārya add the augment an before the suffix -ī to indicate this relationship of wife to husband. Thus Indra beūcomes Indrāni (&lsquo;Indra&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;); Varuna becomes Varuṇānī (&lsquo;Varuna&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;); and ācārya (&lsquo;male teacher&rsquo;) becomes ācāryāṇī (‘a teacher&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;). According to the Kāsikā, several words take this augument optionally. Thus upādhyāya (&lsquo;male teacher&rsquo;) becomes either upā- dhyādhyānī or upādhyāyī (both denoting &rsquo;the wife of the teacher&rsquo;; see Mbh.I.3.100, variant readings; cf. Katy. on Pan.III.3.21); kṣatriya becomes kṣatriyāṇī or kṣatriyā (both denoting the wife of a kṣatriya). It is not clear, therefore, whether the use of the term ksatriyā in the Mahābhārata quotation is meant to indicate a kṣatriya woman or the wife of a kṣatriya man; in fact epic Sanskrit is often not precise. The use of the term upādhyāyiṇī (and variant readings upādhyāyānī and upādhāyī) is clear: the knowledge belongs to the husband not the wife. It should be understood, however, that the distinction between women teachers and the wives of teachers admits of the possibility—in Panini&rsquo;s time if not in Tryambaka&rsquo;s-of women of both categories.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s next three quotations demonstrate that the wife should serve her husband at meals. In the Vanaparvan of the Mahā- bhārata, we are told that &rsquo;the glorious Draupadi, like a mother, first gave food to all her (five) husbands and to the brahmins and (only) then took what was left (sistam; i.e. for herself).&lsquo;83 According to the Agnipurāṇa, the wife &lsquo;should provide for her husband whatūever he likes in a meal, and bring it to him herself. &lsquo;84 According to Vyāsa, &lsquo;one should always eat food that is mixed with ghee, is hot, beneficial, wholesome and of a moderate amount; and which is given (served) by one&rsquo;s wife after she has herself washed the dishes. &lsquo;85 These quotations all stress the attentive service required of the</p>
<p>[[214]]</p>
<p>wife. The reference to Draupadi feeding her husbands ‘like a mother&rsquo; (māteva) recalls the popular subhāṣita that describes the ideal wife as one who is like a slave in her work (kārye dāsī), like a courtesan in bed (ratau veśyā), a mother with regard to food (bhojane jananī- samā), and a counsellor in adversity (vipatsu māntriṇī, vipattau buddhidātrī; Pad.P. srstikhanda 47.56; Subh.p.366, satīvarṇanam 9, 27). The Buddhist equivalent, the patibbatā, is similarly defined as a woman who cares for her husband as devotedly as a mother does for her child (Vim.I.11). Even the Buddha, lecturing the unruly Sujātā on strīdharma, lists the motherly type (mātā) among the four desirable kinds of wife; the others are the sisterly type (bhagini), the companion (sakhi) and the slave (dāsī; Ang. Nik.IV.p.91-4). Unlike Draupadi, however, Sujātā opts to be her husband&rsquo;s slave. Tryambaka alludes to these types himself in his section on women&rsquo;s property: Kausalya&rsquo;s virtue is demonstrated by the fact that she relates to her husband as slave (dāsīvat), friend (sakhīvat), wife (bhāryāvat), sister (bhaginīvat) and mother (mātṛvat), even when her husband ill-treats her (Sdhp.26[2]r.6-26[2]v.2; from section IV, pp.277-80).</p>
<p>The reference to a &lsquo;measured&rsquo; (mitam) amount of food indicates that the good wife should not overfeed her husband. For excessive eating (atibhojanam) does one harm both in this world (anarogyam anāyuṣyam) and in the next (asvargyam; Manu II.57).</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s second major point is that &rsquo;the wife should not be in the presence of her husband when he is eating. &lsquo;86 The ruling for this is taken from Yājñavalkya. &lsquo;One should not eat in the sight of one&rsquo;s wife (bhāryādarśane); nor when wearing (only) one (the lower) garment; nor when standing up.&lsquo;87 Vijñāneśvara glosses bhāryaūdarśane as &lsquo;in front of her when she is nearby&rsquo; (tasyām purato &lsquo;vasthitāyām; Mit. on Yajñ.I.131). Apararka understands both &lsquo;while he is looking at her&rsquo; (bhāryām paśyams) and &lsquo;while she is looking at him&rsquo; (taya ca drṣyamānas tathā; Apar.p.173). To explain &rsquo;the sin (involved) in the presence of the wife&rsquo; (patnyaḥ sanniūdhāne doṣam (i.e. when her husband is eating), both Tryambaka and Vijñānesvara quote the same śruti statement. &lsquo;A man should not</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[215]]</p>
<p>eat in the vicinity of his wife or his offspring will be without strength. &lsquo;88</p>
<p>This idea is evidently one of long standing. For the dizzying array of mystical correspondences set out in the Satapathabrāhmaṇa includes that between the sun, the altar and the eye and, further, that between &rsquo;the man in the sun&rsquo; (mandale puruṣaḥ), &rsquo;the gold man&rsquo; (hiranmayaḥ puruṣaḥ) in the altar, and &rsquo;the man in the right eye&rsquo; (daksine &lsquo;ksan purusaḥ; Sat.Br.X.5.2.6-7). The last of these images is expanded in the verses that follow. Since a man is not complete without his mate, his other half, there is a second &lsquo;person&rsquo; in the left eye (savye &lsquo;kṣan purusah), thus making a pair or couple (mithu nam; Śat.Br.X.5.2.8). The &lsquo;person&rsquo; in the right eye is Indra; that in the left is Indrānī and the god created the nose to keep them apart (vidhṛtim akurvan nāsikām; cf. section IIA, p.78). For this reason the husband should not eat food in the presence of his wife; and if they eat apart, a strong son (viryavan) will be born (Sat.Br.X.5.2.9). Since among men, kings keep apart the most, they are the ones who have strong sons (Śat.Br.X.5.2.10). The last remark presumably refers to the predominantly kṣatriya customs of polygamy and separate women&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>The significance of Tryambaka&rsquo;s prohibition, however, is by no means obvious. In the Smṛticandrika&rsquo;s treatment of the subject, for example, the emphasis is on privacy in general. A man should eat in private (etac ca bhojanam rahasi kāryam; Sm.C.II.p.599). For if he eats in private (guptaḥ), he becomes rich; if he eats in public (praūkāśe), his wealth is lost (Sm.C.II.p.599, Devala). According to some, one should eat entirely alone, that is, even apart from one&rsquo;s own relatives and other brahmins. For if several people sit down to eat in the same row, then each is liable to take on the effects of the others&rsquo; sins (Sm.C.II.p.619, Brhaspati; cf. ekapankti, below, p.221; and one never knows the secret sins of another man (Sm. C.II.p.618, Ād.P.). This idea explains why even today an orthodox brahmin would not dream of eating in a public restaurant. Elseūwhere, the question of being looked at by someone who is not eating arises. According to Uśanas, for example, a man should not eat when many people who are not eating are watching (bahūnām</p>
<p>[[216]]</p>
<p>ca paśyatām); nor should many eat when one such person is watchūing (ekasya pasyataḥ; Sm.C.II.p.615). However, Vis.Sm.68.46 differentiates between this ruling (bahūnām prekṣamāṇānām naiūkasmin bahavas tatha) and the requirement not to eat &rsquo;together with&rsquo; one&rsquo;s wife (nāśnīyād bhāryayā sārdham), thus implying that the reasons behind them are different.</p>
<p>In fact, this very common ruling not to eat &lsquo;with&rsquo; one&rsquo;s wife is usually interpreted to mean not simply that he should eat apart from her but that he should not eat from the same dish. For example, Gautama&rsquo;s prohibition on ‘eating with one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo; (bhāryayā saha bhojana) is glossed by Haradatta as ‘eating from one dish together with one&rsquo;s wife&rsquo; (bhāryayā sahaikasmin bhājane bhojanam; Har. on Gaut.1.9.32). Kullūka interprets a similar ruling in Manu IV.43 (nāśniyād bhāryayā sārdham) in much the same way (bharyayā sahaikapātre nāśnīyāt, Kull.; sārdham ekapātre, Sarv.). For Medhātithi, the prohibition also applies to eating at the same time and place as one&rsquo;s wife (ekādhikaranam ekakāladeśam).</p>
<p>It is clear, however, that such views were not universally accepted. Nandapandita, for example, applies the prohibition only to the lower-caste wife (bhāryā asavarnā; Nand. on Vis.Sm.68.46, Adyar edn.). Several commentators and digest writers allow a brahmin to eat with his brahmin wife (e.g. Sm.C.II.p.617; Mit. on Yājñ.III.200; Par.M.I.i.p.425). According to the Smṛtyarthasara, a man may only eat from the same dish as his wife at the time of their marriage (na bhāryaya sahāsnīyād vivāhavarjyam; Sm.A.p.69). In Baudh.I.1.2.3, however, there is an interesting distinction between the customs of north and south, one that often proves useful to commentators faced with conflicting rules (e.g. Ujj. on Āp.II.4.9.7). Eating with an uninitiated person (anupetena saha bhojanam) and eating with one&rsquo;s wife (striya saha bhojanam) are listed among the five practices peculiar to the south. (The other three are eating stale food and marrying the daughter of either one&rsquo;s maternal uncle or one&rsquo;s paternal aunt.) According to some authorities, the customs of a particular region do not incur sin when practised in that region (Baudh.I.1.2.6); according to others, the traditions of the learned and the conduct of those who live in Aryavarta are always authoriūtative (Baudh.I.1.2.7-9; Gaut.XI.20). The north-south boundary is the river Narmada, running north of Maharashtra. Tryambaka seems to side with the latter view. Thus, although it may be the</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[217]]</p>
<p>custom for southerners to eat with their wives, in his opinion this is</p>
<p>wrong.</p>
<p>There follows a discussion of how the wife should serve the meal. Tryambaka&rsquo;s first point is that &lsquo;when she is serving, she should not serve the food and so on by hand.&lsquo;89 He quotes two ślokas attributed to Śātātapa. &lsquo;(Eating) dishes which are served by hand, and salt served separately (as opposed to salt used in the cooking), is held to be like eating earth or the consumption of cow&rsquo;s meat.&lsquo;90 &lsquo;One should not eat salt, condiments, ghee, oil, or any of the variety of foods that are licked (from the tips of one&rsquo;s fingers, e.g. pickles) or drunk (e.g. soups, sauces, buttermilk, etc.) if they are served by hand.&lsquo;91 Two further slokas attributed to Yama follow. &lsquo;When almsūfood, salt and condiments are served by hand, whoever eats them becomes impure and whoever serves them will not go to heaven.&lsquo;92 &lsquo;When served by hand, delicacies (snehā[h]), salt and condiments do the giver no good, while whoever eats them eats sin.&lsquo;93 For, acūcording to Atri, &lsquo;when ghee or oil falls from the nails of a brahmin woman (when she is serving food by hand), that (food) is deemed inedible; whoever eats it must perform the candrayana fast.&lsquo;94 According to Apastamba, ‘if ghee, oil, salt, liquids, anything made with milk (e.g. rice cooked in milk and sugar), or alms-food is 89. pariveṣaṇasamaye annādikam hastena na pariveṣaṇīyam // Sdhp.17r.7. 90. tatha ca śātātapaḥ // hastadattāni cānnāni pratyakṣalavanam taṭhā / mṛttikābhakṣaṇam caiva gomāmsābhyasanam smṛtam // Sdhp.17r.7-8 (Sat.)&lt; Sm.M.II.p.430 (gaumāmsabhyasanam for go; Sat.); Par.M.I.i.p.428 (goūmāmsāśanavat for gomāmsābhyasanam; Sat.); Sm.C.II.p.604 (as Par.M.).</p>
<p>dātāram nopatisthante</p>
<p>[[218]]</p>
<p>served by hand, it is not to be accepted anywhere; and therefore one should serve (such) food (only if it is) contained in a leaf or grass (bowl or cup) and not by hand. &lsquo;95</p>
<p>Bowls, plates or cups are still woven from certain large leaves (e.g. drona, Marathi; katori, Hindi) and broad-leaved grasses (topli, Marathi) for the use of traditional families, even educated urbanites, especially at times of large gatherings such as weddings and festivals. The Smrticandrikā quotes Paithīnasi&rsquo;s rulings conūcerning the types of leaves that may be used in this way (Sm.C.II. p.602). The custom is even more prevalent in southern India where banana leaves are much in evidence as plates not only in rural homes but also in some city restaurants.</p>
<p>More important, all these rulings, like the previous ones proūhibiting a man from sharing a dish with his wife, relate to the prohibitions on eating the so-called &rsquo;left-overs&rsquo; (ucchistam). If the person serving touches the food, then it is classed with the &rsquo;leftūovers&rsquo; of that person&rsquo;s meal, and as such impure and (therefore) prohibited to anyone else (see pp.221-7).</p>
<p>Tryambaka continues. &ldquo;This is why food should be served with a ladle or something similar (darvyādinā).&rsquo;% In order to make sense of the collection of rulings that follow, several emendations to the text have been necessary. These rest upon the assumption that the items that should not be served by hand (i.e. food in general, condiments, salt, alms-food, ghee, oil, anything cooked in milk, all liquids and &rsquo;lickable&rsquo; substances, etc.; see above) are precisely those that should be served with some instrument such as a ladle (i.e. cooked food or food cooked in milk or ghee, condiments, water, food cooked in oil, and even uncooked food; see below). As we shall see, neither Kane&rsquo;s distinction between cooked and uncooked foods (PVK II.ii.p.762) nor Vidyarṇava&rsquo;s distinction between &rsquo;liquid and semi-liquid articles&rsquo; and non-liquid ones (1979:165) is borne out by these rulings.</p>
<p>The first quotation is attributed to Āpastamba, &lsquo;Cooked food (kṛtānnam; alternatively, &lsquo;food cooked in milk&rsquo;, śṛtānnam; or &lsquo;food cooked in ghee&rsquo;, ghṛtānnam; see note 97) and all condiments</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[219]]</p>
<p>should be served with a ladle.&lsquo;97 Āpastamba is also credited with the pronouncement regarding &rsquo;the sin (involved) in serving water and so on without a ladle ([ā]darvyā; i.e. by hand).&lsquo;98 &lsquo;Whoever wishes to serve water or cooked food without a ladle ([&rsquo;]darvyā) is (on the same level as) a brahmin-killer (bhrūnahā), a drinker of alcohol, a thief and one who sleeps with his teacher&rsquo;s wife. Neither food cooked with oil nor uncooked food should ever be (served) without a ladle (t[va]darvyā).&lsquo;99</p>
<p>We may note first that here, as so often before, Tryambaka depends heavily on the Smṛtimuktāphala. The similarity of both quotations and attributions suggest that they have been drawn directly from it. Secondly, the term bhrūna in bhrūṇahā may mean either &lsquo;brahmin&rsquo; (e.g. Gaut.II.8.11, Har.; Vas.II.42, XX.23) or &lsquo;foetus&rsquo; (e.g. Gaut.III.3.9, Har.; Vas.XX.23; cf. bhrūṇaghnim, Sdhp.38r.4-5, section IV, p.288). Since the purpose of this ruling is to convey absolute condemnation, I have preferred the former interpretation. For brahmin-murder is held to be the greatest crime of all (Manu VIII.381). It is invariably classed as one of the five &lsquo;great sins&rsquo; for which no expiation is possible (mahāpātaka; the fifth, not mentioned here, is consorting with the perpetrators of the other four; cf. Manu XI.54, Yājñ.III.227, Vas.I.20). The classifiūcation of apparently mundane wrong actions (such as serving water without a ladle) as on a par with brahmin-murder is a standard — if extravagant-means of outright condemnation in dharma- śāstra. Tryambaka quotes a similar parallel in relation to the</p>
<p>[[220]]</p>
<p>bad practice of serving unequal portions to diners sitting in the same row (see below).</p>
<p>Tryambaka turns to Parāśara for &rsquo;the sin (involved in) serving food in a vessel made of iron&rsquo; (āyasa; &rsquo;le fer&rsquo;, Finot 1896:34), 100 &lsquo;If food is brought in an iron vessel, he (i.e. whoever eats it) eats the left-overs (ucchiṣṭa) of a dog, and whoever gives it goes to hell. Whether one is bathing, sipping or doing anything else, an iron vessel is inappropriate. &lsquo;101</p>
<p>In view of the variety of rulings available, Tryambaka&rsquo;s insisūtence on this point alone is curious. Certainly, Hārīta prohibits iron and earthenware vessels (Sm.C.II.p.602). But Ap.I.5.17.9-12 declares that one may eat out of an earthenware vessel that has either not been used (anāprīte mrnmaye bhoktavyam) or, if used, has been baked in fire (aprītam ced abhidagdhe); out of a metal one (lohāni; ‘métaux&rsquo;, Finot 1896:12,90) that has been well scoured (parimṛstam lauham prayatam; bhasmabhiḥ parimṛṣṭam; Ujj.); or out of a wooden one that has been well scraped (nirlikhitam dārumaūyam). Moreover, Manu&rsquo;s rules of purification give precise details on how to clean vessels of gold, stone, silver, copper, iron, brass and so on (Manu V.111ff.). Certain materials are prohibited to certain individuals. An ascetic for example, is not to use a metal vessel (ataijasāni pātrāṇi, Manu VI.53; glossed by Kull. as &lsquo;gold, copper, brass or iron&rsquo;; cf. Mit. on Yājñ.III.60; Yatidh.57.79-92; Olivelle 1977:37,168). Similarly, bronze vessels (kāmsyapātra) are prohiūbited to ascetics, Vedic students and widows (Sdhp.46v.1-2, Samvarta, Sm.C.II.p.602, Pracetas; see section IV, p.299). While Manu IV.65 prohibits the use of broken vessels, the Smrtiūcandrika allows broken ones made of copper, silver, gold, conch or stone (Sm.C.II.p.601, Paithīnasi). The menstruating woman, howūever, should ideally use only her own cupped hands (section IV, pp.284-5). The number of different and often conflicting rulings on this subject makes Tryambaka&rsquo;s single prescription all the more surprising.</p>
<p>Still on the subject of how the wife should serve the food, Tryamūbaka rules that she should show no favouritism. &lsquo;When she is</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[221]]</p>
<p>serving, she should not, on account of (her feelings of) affection and so forth, give unequal servings to those seated in the same row (ekapanktyupaviṣṭānām).&lsquo;102 His evidence for this is attributed to Vasistha. &lsquo;When one gives (food) unequally to a row of diners (ekaūpanktau)—whether out of love or fear or the desire for gain-this action, seen in the Vedas and described in verse by the sages, the seers call &ldquo;brahmin-murder&rdquo; (brahmahatyām; cf. above).&lsquo;103</p>
<p>A &lsquo;row of diners&rsquo; (ekapankti) is a continuous line not broken by such formal barriers as a pillar, a door, a passage, changes of ground level, or even by lines drawn on the ground with powder or ashes (as is the custom even today in large gatherings such as weddings). Those sitting together in this continuous row must be of the same caste and social rank. Āp.I.5.17.2, for example, rules that one should not sit in the same row with unworthy people (anarhadbhir vā samānapanktau); glossed by Haradatta as those who lack good family, learning and moral conduct (abhijanavidyāvṛttarahitā; Ujj. on Āp.I.5.17.2). For, as I have already remarked, those who sit together in this way partake of each other&rsquo;s sins (see above, p.215). It follows, therefore, that those who sit in the same row are necesūsarily of the same rank, and so they should be treated equally.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s next subsection concerns the wife&rsquo;s own meal. His first point is that &lsquo;she should pay homage to her husband&rsquo;s feet (bhartuḥ pādavandanam) before she eats.&lsquo;104 His evidence is attriūbuted to &lsquo;Skanda.&rsquo; &lsquo;One supreme rule is pronounced for women: she should (first) pay homage to her husband&rsquo;s feet and then eat; this is the firm opinion (of the authorities). &lsquo;105</p>
<p>Unlike the custom of paying homage to the feet of one&rsquo;s parentsūin-law (see pp.161-2), that of touching the husband&rsquo;s feet is no</p>
<p>[[222]]</p>
<p>longer in evidence in Maharashtra today, nor was it even eighty years ago except perhaps as a preliminary to the wedding night (LSJ). Nonetheless, this gesture-reflecting as it does the many smrti statements to the effect that the husband is the &lsquo;god and master&rsquo; of the wife (e.g. Manu V.154; Rām.II.24.21; Mbh.XIII. 134.51)—clearly was practised in orthodox households at least until the middle of the eighteenth century. Indeed, as already noted above (p.138), the high-caste village women of Nepal still &lsquo;pay homage&rsquo; to their husbands&rsquo; feet before every rice meal by drinking their &lsquo;foot water&rsquo; (Bennett 1983: 174–5). Another possible interūpretation of the ruling is that the wife should massage her husband&rsquo;s feet to relax him after the meal (see plate 8).</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s second point is that &rsquo;the wife (patnī) should eat what is left (ucchistam) after her husband has eaten (plate 9).106 This ruling is supported by three quotations. The first is attributed to Manu. &lsquo;After drinking the apośanam, a man should eat what has been given (to him) on his plate if there is nothing wrong with it and then he should leave some remainder (ucchistam) for his wife, his servants and his slaves.&lsquo;107 According to Vyasa, &lsquo;she (i.e. the good wife) desires what is given by her husband: she should eat what is left of her husband&rsquo;s food, water, fruit and so on, saying &ldquo;This is a great prasada!&quot;&lsquo;108 Tryambaka&rsquo;s statement that &rsquo;the wife should eat only after her husband has eaten&rsquo; is also supported with a quotation attributed to Vyasa. &lsquo;If she (first) serves the gods, guests and servants, and her husband too, and then-according to the rules (of tradition) and the (Vedic) injunction-eats the food that is left over (seṣānūnam), her household will always be well fed and contented, and she will be firmly grounded in her religious duty.&lsquo;109</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[223]]</p>
<p>Apośana is the technical term for the water sipped from the cupped hand (from the brahmatīrtha; see acamana, section IIA, pp.75-7), in the ritual performed before eating (bhojanavidhí). After the vaisvadeva ritual, when the food is served, the man about to eat sprinkles water around the plate (paryuṣitam), announcing to the god of food: &lsquo;You are truth and I sprinkle you with truth&rsquo; (satyam tva rtena pariṣiñcāmi, in the evening; ṛtam tvā satyena pariṣincāmi, at midday; Sm.A.69-70). Next, he makes offerings of rice on the ground beside his plate (baliharanam) to the lord of the earth (bhupataye svāhā/bhuvanapataye svāhā/bhūtānām pataye svāhā//). Then he sips a little water (apośanam; cf. Yājñ.I.106) from the base of his thumb, while announcing that it is nectar and will act as a &lsquo;cushion&rsquo; for the god of food (amṛtopastaranam asi). Then he makes five offerings of rice to the five &lsquo;breaths&rsquo; (prānāya svāhā| apānāya svāhā| udānāya svāhā| vyānāya svāhā| sāmānāya svāhā //). After these five prāṇāhutis, the late digests (and modern practice) add a sixth offering to Brahman: he touches water, then his eyelids and forehead (saying, brahmane namah), and only then begins to eat (LSJ;PVK II.i.p.764). At the end of the meal, he again sips a little water, announcing this time that it will act as the &lsquo;cover&rsquo; for the god of food (amṛtāpidhānam asi). This ritual of bhojanavidhi is performed only by men. With some variations, it is still practised in the more orthodox households today (cf. Vidyārṇava 1979:163– 5).</p>
<p>Ucchista is what is left on a person&rsquo;s plate after he has eaten, with some exceptions (ucchistaseṣaṇam tu ghṛtādivyatiriktaviṣayam; Par.M.I.i.p.422). In fact, it was important not to eat everything on one&rsquo;s plate. As both the Parāśaramādhavīya and the Smṛtimuktā- phala explain, a man should always leave some food on his plate after a meal, except for certain specific substances (e.g. curd, honey, ghee, milk; Par.M.I.i.p.422; Sm.M.II.p.431). These &lsquo;permitted leftūovers&rsquo; are to be given to his dependants: to his wife, servants or slaves, as Tryambaka&rsquo;s quotation explains. No one else should eat them. Even a sudra may not do so unless he is a dependant (Manu IV.80; but cf. Vas.XI.10). A similar prohibition from Apastamba adds that if one does give these remnants to a non-brahmin, one should clean one&rsquo;s teeth and put the food particles thus acquired back on the plate before offering it (dantān skuptvā vilikhya tanūmalam tasminn ucchisteva dhāya dadyāt; Ujj. on Ap.I.11.31.22), thus making its impurity graphically clear. The ruling that one</p>
<p>[[224]]</p>
<p>should not eat the remains of anyone else&rsquo;s meal is relaxed only for the child (who may eat his parents&rsquo; left-overs; cf. Sm.M.II.p.431); for the student (who should eat those of his teacher, at least in a formal sense; cf. Mit. on Yājñ.1.33; Baudh.1.2.3.35,etc.); for serūvants (who should eat those of their master); and, in particular, for the wife (who should eat those of her husband, from his plate). Thus when Draupadi, disguised as a servant, agrees to work for Virāta&rsquo;s queen Sudeṣṇā, she insists that she will only work for one who does not give her &rsquo;left-overs&rsquo; to eat or make her wash his feet (yo me na dadyād ucchiṣṭam na ca pādau pradhāvayet; Mbh.IV.8.29). The agreement between the two women that such things will not be required of her amounts to a promise that Virāta will make no sexual demands of Draupadi; that is, he will not treat her like a wife. Hence too the ruling that the menstruating woman should not eat from her husband&rsquo;s plate until she has been purified on the fourth day: marital intimacy is excluded at this time (see p.285).</p>
<p>It must be remembered, however, that for food to be acceptable in the first place, it must already be the sanctified &rsquo;left-overs&rsquo; of the gods, ancestors, guests and anyone else on the list of priority given above. As Manu explains in several slokas, the householder should eat what remains (sesa) after he has offered food to the gods, sages, guests, ancestors and household deities (Manu III.117); he and his wife should eat what is left (avasistam) after the brahmins, relatives and servants have eaten (Manu III.116). A man who eats without first providing for guests and dependants is doomed (Manu III.115, 118); whereas the food that is left after the performance of a sacrifice (vajñaśista) is the food of virtuous men (Manu III.118). Thus, just as a man looks forward to eating the prasāda of a sacrifice or pūjā, believing it to be blessed by the ritual offering (cf. Gonda 1980: 187ff.; Vidyārṇava 1979:163; Morinis 1984:73), so the wife should look forward to eating the prasada left on her husband&rsquo;s plate after the ritual of eating, believing it to be doubly blessed. In this context, Tryambaka&rsquo;s use of the term patni seems apt: we may conclude both that the practice is a religious duty rather than merely a domestic matter, and that it is the privilege of the chief wife. The explicit reference to the husband&rsquo;s &rsquo;left-overs&rsquo; as prasāda is a further reflection of the traditional belief that a woman&rsquo;s husband is her primary god. In more general terms, as Parry explains, what pollutes the pure purifies the impure (1979: 97-100). Thus the &rsquo;leftūovers&rsquo; of the higher castes purify the lower castes; the prasada con-</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[225]]</p>
<p>secrated to the gods purifies all worshippers who receive it; and the remains of the husband&rsquo;s meal purify the wife.110</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s next statement, together with its supporting quotaūtion from Manu, concerns the wife&rsquo;s offering to the goddess Jyesthā. I shall deal with this later (see below, pp.227-9). Here, I shall proceed with the other rulings relating to the wife&rsquo;s own meal.</p>
<p>A third point concerning this topic is that &rsquo;the patni should avoid all food, drink and so on that her husband does not eat.&lsquo;111 According to Vyasa, &rsquo;the chaste wife (sati) should avoid everything that her husband does not drink, eat or (in any way) consume (e.g. betel, etc.).&lsquo;112 Like Gāndhārī who, by blindfolding herself, chose not to see what her blind husband could not see (Mbh.I.110.14), the ideal wife should not even taste what her husband cannot or will not eat. Even at the beginning of the twentieth century, this was both the ideal and the practice of the more orthodox households (LSJ). For, as previously noted, it was believed that the perfect wife grew to be more and more like her husband until eventually she merged with him as the river merges with the sea (Manu IX.22; cf. above, pp.34-9, 156–7).</p>
<p>•</p>
<p>[[226]]</p>
<p>A fortiori, &rsquo;the (good) wife should not eat (tasty or especially) wholesome food while neglecting (to serve them to) her husband.&lsquo;113 A quotation attributed to ‘Skanda&rsquo; explains. &lsquo;If a woman neglects her husband while she alone eats wholesome food, then she will be (reborn as) a village sow or a female bat that eats its own excreūment.&lsquo;114 Clearly, if a woman eats only what is left on her husūband&rsquo;s plate, there is little danger that this might happen. Since the hog eats all the village refuse and excrement and is commonly known by names deriving from this fact (e.g vitcara, vidvaraha), the last epithet may refer to it as well as to the bat. We may also note that threats of this kind always specify a female animal for a female offender: not only is it normal for a woman to retain her gender in transmigration (cf. Manu XII.72; Sdhp.39v.10-40r.1, from section IV, p.188), but a female is always a step below the male in the scale of births. This point is discussed in more detail in section III on the inherent nature of women.</p>
<p>Tryambaka&rsquo;s final point regarding the wife&rsquo;s meal is that &lsquo;she should not eat while her husband is watching.&lsquo;115 According to a śloka attributed to Vyasa, &lsquo;she should not do any of the following things when her husband is watching: eating, vomiting, sleeping, getting dressed or making herself beautiful.&lsquo;116 This is the second of two slokas, both attributed to Vyasa, that are dealt with earlier in Tryambaka&rsquo;s subsection on getting dressed in the morning (section IIA, pp.95-6, note 72). Similar rulings may be found elseūwhere. Manu IV.43, for example, rules that a man should not look at his wife when she is eating, sneezing, yawning or sitting at ease (āsīnām yathāsukham). Gaut.IX.9.32 specifies not looking at a woman who is anointing her body with oil (cf. Har.).</p>
<p>The Satapathabrāhmaṇa gives one reason why the husband should</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[227]]</p>
<p>eat apart from his wife (Śat.Br.X.5.2.9; see above, pp.214-17), and quite another for why the wife should eat apart from her husband. As is explained in the section on offerings made to the wives of the gods (patnīsamyāga), one should conceal such offerings and the fire from the sight of the male gods. If one does not do this, the gods will expect to receive those offerings themselves and so will be disappointed. The verse concludes: and this is why Yajñaūvalkya says that on earth too women should eat apart from men (Śat.Br.I.9.2.12).</p>
<p>I now return to the rulings omitted earlier concerning the wife&rsquo;s equivalent to her husband&rsquo;s pre-dinner ritual (bhojanavidhí). &lsquo;Women should make an offering of food (balidānam) to the goddess Jyestha at the time of their own meal.&lsquo;117 The following two slokas are attributed to Manu. &lsquo;The woman who does not make a daily food-offering (bali) to Jyestha, according to her resources, from the food she is about to eat, will go to hell when she dies. Women who want sons, grandsons and wealth should propitiate Jyestha with a food-offering (balikarman) every day without fail.&lsquo;118</p>
<p>It is important to distinguish between three separate rituals here. First, the &lsquo;great sacrifice&rsquo; (mahāyajña) in which morsels of food are offered to all beings (balikarman, bhūtayajña; e.g. Āp.II.2.3.18ff.; PVK II.ii.pp.745ff.; cf. above, pp.176-8), is performed by men at the same time as the vaisvadeva ritual. Secondly, the simple offering of morsels of food beside one&rsquo;s plate as a formality before eating (baliharana) is performed by men as part of the bhojanavidhi. Thirdly, women are required to make their own formal offering of morsels of food to the goddess Jyeṣṭhā (balidānam) before they too may eat. By using the term balikarman for the women&rsquo;s ritual, it is being deliberately raised to the level of the rituals performed by men. This is in keeping with the high moral tone with which the duties of women are described in this treatise.</p>
<p>Jyestha, literally &rsquo;eldest&rsquo;, is the goddess of misfortune, personi-</p>
<p>[[228]]</p>
<p>fied as the elder sister of Laksmi or Śrī, the goddess of beauty and prosperity. According to some accounts of the myth of the great churning of the ocean by the gods and demons, Jyestha was born from the poison swallowed by Siva (e.g. Pad.P.VI.260.22-3). Acūcording to the Lingapurāna (II.6.2ff.), she emerged from the ocean when it was churned for the second time (v.4). Jyestha (also called Alakṣmi, &lsquo;misfortune&rsquo;) represents the darker side of creation. As the Lingapurāna explains, in order to delude mankind (mohanāya), Visnu made the universe twofold (jagaddvaidham idam cakre). The good half (dharma) comprised the brahmins, the Vedas, and the goddess Śrī (v.3); the bad half (adharma) comprised wicked or inferior men (aśubhān), those outside the Vedas (veda[b]āhyān) and the goddess Jyesṭhā (v.4). The latter dwells far from the path of the Vedas (v.17,27) and is always present wherever husband and wife quarrel (yatra bhartā ca bhārya ca parasparavirodhinau; v.31) and wherever false mendicants (bhikṣu[b]imba; i.e. heretics), naked Jains (kṣapanaka) or Buddhists (bauddha) are found (v.54). Acūcording to the myth, Jyestha married a sage who found her so irreliūgious and antisocial that he abandoned her in such a place where local divinities were worshipped and heretical (i.e. non-Vedic) rituals were performed. Instructing her to support herself on the offerings made by women devotees (v.79), the sage left her there. Eventually, Jyesthā repented of her ways and turned to Visnu for help.</p>
<p>Throughout his treatise, Tryambaka insists that the orthodox wife should worship no deity other than her husband. It is interestūing, therefore, that the only exceptions he allows are the two sister goddesses, Śrī (Lakṣmi) and Jyesthā (Alakṣmī). I have discussed briefly the ambivalent attitudes evident in stories about Śrī and the negative associations carefully glossed over by Tryambaka (see section IIA, pp.60-3). Jyeṣṭhā presents an even more ambivalent image of and for the Hindu wife. Indeed, the resonances between the goddess and her namesake in orthodox society-the jyestha or senior wife in the polygamous household-are particularly striking. As the older wife-perhaps superseded by a younger one chosen for her beauty rather than according to ritual requirements— the goddess is usually portrayed as a woman of unappealing face and solid proportions. An ornate hair-style, costly ornaments, and the tilaka on her forehead indicate her good fortune in that her husband is still alive (cf. section IIA, pp.96-101). She is flanked</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[229]]</p>
<p>by two attendants, described in the texts as her son and daughter, and so has evidently earned the respect due to the mother of her husband&rsquo;s ritual heir. While the crow on her banner and the donkey ascribed to her in some texts are clearly inauspicious, the broomūstick is both a tool and a weapon.119 In fact, this highly ambivalent image combines many of the major themes relating to the highūcaste senior wife: domestic concerns; ritual inferiority; and yet the acknowledged power in the home. As the goddess of &lsquo;inferior&rsquo; people who lack Vedic initiation and ritual, Jyestha is the obvious recipient of the worship of women. But the offering of food by orthodox (yet uninitiated) women to such a goddess presents a marked contrast with the equivalent offerings made by their initiated husbands (cf. Leslie 1984).</p>
<p>Tryambaka finally considers what the good wife should do after her meal (bhojanānantarakrtyam). A general rule, presumably applicable to both men and women, is attributed to Sandilya. &lsquo;After washing both hands with either earth or something like ground māṣa beans, and after washing one&rsquo;s knees and feet, one should clean one&rsquo;s teeth with twigs.&lsquo;120 Māṣa beans are a common food today (considered heavy and hard to digest; Meulen beld 1974:194), but in earlier times they were also used as a cleansing agent (cf. Gode 1969:163, Apar.). (The question of the twigs to be used for cleaning one&rsquo;s teeth is discussed in section IIA, pp.78-82).</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; according to the Smṛtyarthasara, ‘after washing one&rsquo;s hands, one should drop (water) into one&rsquo;s eyes by letting it trickle from (the ends of) one&rsquo;s fingers. Then one should touch one&rsquo;s eyes (i.e. wipe them), sip water, and contemplate one&rsquo;s personal deity</p>
<p>[[230]]</p>
<p>(istadevatā).&lsquo;121 The act of dropping water into the eyes after a meal is both a ritual and a medical requirement. For the fingers used are those one has been eating with and the traces of food left on them (after washing) are believed to have healing qualities. The term upasparśana can mean touching something with water as a form of ablution but it is used in this context to denote the acamana ritual described earlier (pp.75-7). For even today it is the custom of orthodox men or initiated boys (e.g. in a traditional pāṭhaśālā) to eat, wash hands, drop water into the eyes, and then sit with their hands &lsquo;between their knees&rsquo; (antarjānu; cf. section IIC, p.75) to do the sipping ritual (LSJ). The implication here is that women should do this too.</p>
<p>The next set of rulings describes the process of clearing away and washing up; these are also couched in the masculine. Attributed to Āpastamba, they are taken from the Apastambadharmasūtra section on the duties of the householder. (Any particles left) where it (the meal) has been eaten should be swept up and taken away, and the area should be sprinkled with water. Then one should scrape the traces of food from the vessels, wash (the vessels) with water, and take them to a clean (or pure) place to the north for Rudra. In this way, the home becomes auspicious (subham) (again), &lsquo;122</p>
<p>To clarify this, Tryambaka gives Haradatta&rsquo;s commentary on the sutra, interspersed with what seem to be comments of his own. The explanation runs as follows. &lsquo;Yatra (implies sthāne and thus) means &ldquo;in the place where food is eaten”. “One should sweep it up&rdquo; means one should gather the left-overs in that place into a pile with a broom and take them elsewhere. When one has taken them out, one should sprinkle the area with water. After sprinkling it with water, then from those vessels, that is, those in which the cooking was done</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[231]]</p>
<p>at the time123—and on this subject (Tryambaka interjects), Amara declares that bhānda, pātra, amatra and bhājana all mean &ldquo;conūtainer&rdquo; 124 — from them one should scrape the &ldquo;traces&rdquo;, that is, the traces of food and condiments. Then one should wash (the vessels) with water. Then one should take (the vessels) to a clean place to the north, that is, of the house, saying &ldquo;Let this be for Rudra; &ldquo;125 or (Tryambaka interjects), according to another work, saying “May homage be to Rudra.&ldquo;126 In this way, the home becomes auspicious (śivam), that is, it becomes prosperous. This is the meaning (of the sūtrā), &lsquo;127</p>
<p>Although neither Apastamba nor Tryambaka specify that this process of cleaning up should be done by the wife or the women of the household, in the context of Tryambaka&rsquo;s treatise this is the obvious interpretation. As Tryambaka explains below, washing up after the midday meal is one of the major domestic duties the wife must complete before sunset. The sprinkling of water in the place where food has been eaten indicates both a physical cleansing of the area and a ritual purification. Indeed, Vidyārṇava warns that this cleansing of both the vessels used and the place of eating is essential for the ritual purity of all concerned: &lsquo;for a man is not really puriūfied so long as these are not cleansed&rsquo; (1979:165).</p>
<p>The wife&rsquo;s final post-prandial duty is to prepare betel. Two unattributed slokas explain. &lsquo;After eating, while sitting at one&rsquo;s</p>
<p>[[232]]</p>
<p>ease, (one should prepare) something cleansing for the mouth using betel, and something cleansing (for the system) using one of the essential ingredients such as the sunthi root or the amalaka fruit. Then one should offer a good areca nut and a good leaf with powderūed lime on it to the brahmins (i.e. guests) and to the gods; and after that one may chew betel (oneself).&lsquo;128 In a medical context, sodhana (translated here as &lsquo;something cleansing&rsquo;) denotes medicine that removes bad humours (Meulenbeld 1974:511). In particular, śunthi (usually translated as &lsquo;dried ginger'129) and betel are taken to stimulate the digestion (Meulenbeld 1974:462-3; 474–5). Since it is the wife&rsquo;s duty to prepare all the items necessary for the gods in the devapujā ritual (including food and betel), and to prepare food for and serve her husband, his guests and family, we may assume that it is also her job to prepare and serve the items for refreshment and digestion after the meal (cf. Sinha 1980:126–7). We should also note, however, that since the use of betel is also deemed to make a woman attractive (see section IIA, pp. 96–7), it is forbidden to the menstruating woman, the woman whose husūband is away, and the widow (see section IV, pp.284–5, 291, 299– 300).</p>
<p>According to Daksa, one should spend the rest of the afternoon (i.e. the sixth and seventh parts of an eightfold day) allowing one&rsquo;s meal to digest while listening to recitals of the epics and purānas (Dakṣa II.61-9; cf. pp.45-9). According to Yajñ.1.113, the rest of the day (ahaḥśeṣam; i.e. until sunset) should be spent in the company of learned men (siṣṭaiḥ; glossed by Mit. as itihāsapurānā- divedibiḥ), those one likes (istaih; glossed by Mit. as kavyakathā- prapancacaturaiḥ, &rsquo;those skilled in acting out scenes from drama and narrative&rsquo;), and one&rsquo;s own relatives. It seems clear from Bāṇa&rsquo;s account in the Kadambarī, for example, that these pleasures were also available to royal or court women such as queen Vilāsavatī (anavaratavācyamānāḥ punyakathāḥ śuśrāva; Kād.p.135). As I have suggested in my introduction, perhaps Tryambaka&rsquo;s</p>
<p>Day</p>
<p>[[233]]</p>
<p>own treatise was intended to be read aloud to the court women and expounded upon during this afternoon siesta (see pp.22-3, 49). Tryambaka, however, mentions no such activity. Instead, he lists all the household tasks that the wife should dispatch before sunset.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cleaning the house (a second time), washing the pots (after the midday meal), and gathering together all the paraphernalia (reūquired for the evening rituals)-these tasks should definitely be done before sunset because they are necessary for the vaisvadeva, atithi and other rituals which should be performed in the evening. But the pounding of rice should not be done at sunset (a second time).&lsquo;130 Tryambaka quotes a sloka attributed to the Mārkandeyaūpurāna. &lsquo;If a woman in her ignorance cleans rice and so on when the sun has set, she will be barren in life after life.&lsquo;131 On the other hand, also according to the Mārkandeyapurana, &lsquo;it is wrong not to clean the house in the evening: if a woman fails to do the cleaning at sunset, she will be without husband and property in life after life.&lsquo;132</p>
<p>Despite the apparent confusion about the timing of these tasks, there seem to be two points. First, the preparation of rice (cleaning, pounding, etc.) should be done only once a day, before dawn. Secondly, other household tasks such as sweeping and cleaning the house, should be done both morning (i.e. before dawn) and evening (i.e. before sunset). Similarly, the washing of pots and pans after the midday meal and the preparations for the evening ritual should all be completed before sunset. In this way, both home and wife will be in a fit state for the evening ritual and the evening meal. As we shall see, the preparations for the evening rituals presuppose the preparation of food as well.</p>
