IID Evening (Sdhp. 19v.4-21r.3) 

The considerably shorter section relating to the wife's duties in the evening may be divided into two main groups. First, Tryambaka deals briefly with the evening equivalents of morning rituals and tasks: the evening agnihotra, paying respect to one's elders, the vaiśvadeva ritual and bali offerings, paying homage to guests, and the evening meal (Sdhp.19v.4-20r.4). Secondly, he gives several rulings regarding sexual intercourse at night (sayanam; Sdhp. 20r.4-21r.2). 

On the question of whether the wife need be present at the evening agnihotra ritual as well as at the morning one, opinions differ. Tryambaka explains that, according to Baudhāyana, 'the wife's presence at the evening ritual is necessary." The first part of the sūtra quoted is also given in Tryambaka's section on the morning fire ritual (section IIB, p.130, note 26). "The chief wife (patnī) should be present at the evening and the morning (sacrifice).' The rest of the sutra adds that ‘some say (she should be present) every evening.' Tryambaka concludes that ‘in that case, there would be no rule (requiring the patni's presence) for the morning (ritual).'[^2] 

The second ritual duty to be performed by the wife each evening is that of paying respect to her elders (cf. section IIC, pp.156–68). According to the Smṛtiratna, 'such things as paying respect to one's elders and homage to guests should be done (in the evening) as (they are) in the morning.'[^3] The quotation is given in the masculine. '(In the evening) as in the morning (lit. daytime), one who has performed the fire ritual, paid homage to his elders and, according to his resources, offered hospitality to guests may perform the vaisvadeva and bali rituals and then eat.'[^4]

[[235]]

Tryambaka continues. 'The cooking for the vaiśvadeva ritual should also be done in the evening (a second time).' The quotation that follows is attributed to Visnu. ‘O king, in the evening as well (as in the morning), one should take freshly cooked food and, together with one's wife, make bali offerings at the time of the vaiśvadeva ritual.'[^5] The quotation is precisely as given in both the Parāśaramādhavīya and the Smṛticandrika. In the Visnupurāṇa, however, which all three claim to quote, it is the patni who should take the freshly cooked food and make the bali offerings, but without mantras (patny amantram). Tryambaka makes this point next, with an important proviso. 'In the evening (lit. “at night"), if the husband is not there, the vaisvadeva and bali offerings may also be performed by the patni, but without mantras.'[^6] He quotes Manu. "The patni should make the bali offering using food prepared in the evening, without mantras.'[^7] But neither Manu nor his commentators stipulate that the husband should be away before this ruling comes into effect. The second half of Manu's sloka merely explains that the vaisvadeva ritual, and therefore the bali offerings too, are prescribed for both morning and evening. According to Tryambaka, however, the patni may only substitute for her husband when the latter is away; otherwise she should assist as usual. Either way, she should prepare fresh food for the evening ritual. 

Tryambaka next deals with the ritual hospitality to guests which, according to the Visnupurana, should be observed before the evening meal as well as before the midday one (cf. section IIC, pp. 183-210). In fact, the ritual is of even greater importance in the

than at midday. The quotation reads as follows. "The wise man should honour any guest who comes (to his house) according to his own resources. He should bid him welcome, O Pārthiva, and honour him, bowing down as he offers him water to wash his feet and a seat, and then (he should honour him) by offering food and a bed. O king, whatever sin accrues to men when a daytime guest turns his back and leaves (unfed), that same (sin) increases eightfold when he turns his back and leaves (unfed) once the sun has set.'[^8] The idea that the evening meal is of greater ritual importance than the midday meal no doubt follows from the fact that the evening agnihotra is the primary part of the twofold fire ritual, cf, agnisuśruṣa; section IIB, pp.102-7). On the practical level, of course, it is also harsher to turn a stranger away at night. 

Finally, Tryambaka considers the evening meal itself. According to Sandilya, 'the householder should eat at night that which is beneficial, wholesome and very satisfying." Clearly, Tryambaka's treatment of evening rituals and duties tells us little more than that these activities should be performed in the evening much as they are in the morning or at midday. 

Tryambaka begins his subsection on going to bed (śayanam) with a quotation from the Smṛtyarthasara. 'After performing the vaiśvadeva oblation (homa) and offering hospitality to guests, after eating a light meal surrounded by one's dependants, then, making (full) use of sweet-smelling unguents, garlands, betel and so on, one

should sleep with one's wife.'[^10] The Pune edition of the Smṛtyarthasara emphasizes that a man should sleep with his own wife (svastriyā saha). The statement that a man should eat 'surrounded by his dependants' seems somewhat at odds with the rulings mentioned earlier concerning the ritual importance of privacy at meals or at least of eating only with those of similar rank (section IIC, pp.214-17). We must therefore assume the formal separation of diners by, for example, powder designs on the ground between them (cf. ekapankti; p.221). 

Tryambaka gives the ruling for the wife. 'Only after she has paid homage (namaskṛtya) to her husband's feet may she go to bed.'[^11] This statement is supported by a sloka attributed to Vyāsa. ‘After paying homage to her husband's feet, she should go to bed. Treating her beloved in a way that gives him pleasure (ahladasamyuktam kṛtvā), she should engage in sexual intercourse (samyogam acaret; i.e. she should make love to him).’[^12] 

This ruling, with its emphasis on the initiative of the wife, recalls the view mentioned earlier that the ideal woman is all things to her husband: mother, sister, friend, slave and lover (pp.213–14). In fact, according to the writers of manuals on sexual love, the women of Maharashtra were considered especially proficient in the erotic arts and prepared to take the initiative themselves (sakalacatuḥṣaṣṭiprayogarāginyaḥ; Kām.II.5.29). There is, of course, the common (male) belief that the sexuality of women is greater than that of men and their need for intercourse consequently more imperative (e.g. Carstairs 1971:73). The negative consequences of this are discussed at some length in section III (pp.246-72) on the inherent nature of women. According to the theorists, wives are of three basic kinds: very young and therefore extremely shy in sexual matters (mugdha, ‘artless'; navoḍhā, 'newly married'; Randhawa 1962: plate II); somewhat more advanced and less inhibited (madhyama or madhya); and, best of all, the mature wife who is confident of her own sexuality (praudhā;

[[238]]

Randhawa 1962: plate III; Bahadur 1972: 26ff.). In his section on general behaviour, Tryambaka himself advocates a bold confidence in sexual matters (prāgalbhyam kāmakaryeṣu, Sdhp. 22v.4; section IV, pp.273-4; cf. plates 12, 13). 

Following the scribal notations on MS T1, I shall take the Baudhayana quotation next. It describes the scene from the husband's point of view. 'Then he should take her into a beautiful room that has been well washed and smeared with cow-dung; (a room that is) perfumed, decked with flowers, incense, lights and a bed; a place where they will not be disturbed; (one that is) illuminated in the (four) directions by means of wicks placed in ghee; (one that has) above (the head of the bed) a jar of water and a mirror. In such a place, he should make love to her.'[^13] 

Paintings depicting the scene show most of the items listed here. For example, one of the many classifications of women includes the wife who expects her husband or lover to return at any moment and who waits at the door with the bed prepared (vāsakasajjā; Bahadur 1972:114). The paintings show a private room carefully arranged with a bed and cushions (Randhawa 1962; figs.36,37,39), garlands of flowers (figs.37,39), lighted candles in each of the four directions (fig.39, plate XIII), containers for such things as sandalwood paste, perfumed unguents and betel (figs.36,39), and a water-pot at the head of the bed (figs.36,39; cf. Sm.M.II.p.457; Sm.C.II.p.629). In particular, sandalwood paste is used to cool and perfume the body, betel to sweeten the breath (cf. section IIA, pp.96-7). Scenes showing the delights of love-making (samyoga) also record many of the items prescribed by Baudhayana (e.g. Randhawa 1962: fig.76; plates III,IV,XIX). In the Kamasutra too, such a 'pleasure room' (ratyāvāsa) is described as decked with flowers and fragrant with perfumes (Kām.II.10.1). The mirror is a frequent addition to such scenes, either as an essential part of the toilet of either husband or wife (Randhawa 1962:45, figs. 14,28,49, plate X; Sinha 1980:123) or as a means of intensifying the experience of sexual union (Randhawa 1962:29, fig.6). Although Baudhāyana does not say so, it would presumably be the wife's job to prepare

the room and to gather the items required for love-making (as she does those for image worship; see section IIC, pp.178–80, notes 34-5). 

To avoid repetition, I have extended the passage transposed by the scribe of MS T, to include the following two sutras, also attributed to Baudhāyana. The first, attributed to the Baudhāyanagṛhyaparibhāṣāsūtra, describes the preliminaries to love-making. "Then, when the sun has set, they adorn each other and lie down on the bed. Then he decks her with a garland (full) of all kinds of sweet fragrances.'[^14] According to the second sutra, attributed to the Baudhāyanagṛhyaseṣasutra, the husband should make love to (his wife) in the first half of the night; and from midnight to the brāhmamuhūrta (see section IIA, pp.51-2), sleeping on a low bed (or on the ground; adhaḥsayanam) (is enjoined).'[^15] 

It is not clear whether the last of these rulings applies to both husband and wife or only to the wife. Judging by the many paintings depicting the place of love-making, a raised bed was common among the wealthier classes (Randhawa 1962: plates XIX,III; figs.21,37, 39). Tryambaka himself alludes to such a bed in his section on women's property. For the items that Sītā gives away before her departure into the forest include ‘a raised bed studded with jewels and covered with luxurious cushions' (paryankam agryāstaranam nānāratnavibhāṣitam, Sdhp.26[3]v.4-5; from section IV, pp.277-80). The term pāryanka denotes a particularly fine wooden four-poster (e.g. Sinha 1980:43,61,151,159). Such a bed is typical of wealthy or princely families, and examples may still be found in Indian palaces today. According to Tryambaka, neither the menstruating woman nor the widow is permitted to sleep on such a bed (see section IV, pp.284-5, 299-300). 

It seems unlikely that, after making love, both husband and wife would descend to the floor to sleep (cf. Randhawa 1962: plate III, depicting the entwined couple in what appears to be post-coital sleep, still on their raised bed). Perhaps Tryambaka's intention is 

[^14]: bodhāyanaparibhāṣāyām || athāstam ita āditye 'nyonyam alaṅkṛtyopari sayyāyām sayāte / athainām sarvasurabhigandhamālyā yunakti ¡¡ iti¡¡ Sdhp. 20v.1-3 (bodhāyanaparibhāṣāyām < ?

[[240]]

that the wife should leave her husband to sleep on the bed while she resorts to a mat on the floor. It is certainly customary in some rural areas today (e.g. in western Rajasthan) for the husband to sleep on a raised bed while his wife and family sleep on the floor (or on a low bed; cf. Chaki-Sircar 1984:98). In fact, the practice was fairly common among traditional families in Maharashtra earlier this century (LSJ). Moreover, dharmasastra rulings specify that the couple should only lie together during sexual intercourse (yavat samnipātam caiva sahaśayyā; Āp.II.1.1.21); once that is over, they should sleep separately (tato nānā, Āp.II.1.1.22; tataḥ prthak śayīyātām, Ujj., Benares edn.) and bathe (Ap.II.1.1.23;II.1.2. 1; Gaut.I.9.25; Manu V.144). 

Back in sequence once more, Tryambaka's next point is that 'she (the wife) should not sleep naked.'[^16] The subsequent quotation is attributed to Manu. 'They should make love, the man having removed his clothes, the woman without removing hers; if both remove their clothes, discord will enter (into them).'[^17] 

This seems a surprising ruling, especially in view of the obvious nakedness of the woman in some of the paintings extolling sexual love (e.g. Plates 12, 13; cf. Randhawa 1962: plate III; Sinha 1980: 43, 45, 49, 51, etc.). It is also at odds with the ruling below that she should not keep her blouse on. Perhaps what is meant here is that, if she removes her clothes to make love, she should dress again to sleep. Āśv.gr.III.9.6, for example, rules that a man should not look at a naked woman except during sexual intercourse (na nagnām striyam īkṣetānyatra maithunāt). Certainly, it is customary for women even today to sleep in their saris. It was also the custom, especially in middle-class homes a generation or two ago, for the wife to wash and put on a clean sari after making love. (As a result, children amused themselves by noting whether the sari worn on emerging from the bedroom in the morning was the same as that worn on disappearing into it at night; LSJ.) However, although Tryambaka's own words may be interpreted in this way, the śloka he quotes may not. With regard to men, although (according to Tryambaka) they may remove their clothes for love-making, they too should not sleep naked 

[^16]: śayanam ca nagnayā na kartavyam ¡¡ Sdhp.20r. 7-8.

[[241]]

(Āśv.gr.III.9.6; Gaut.I.9.60; Manu IV.75; Viṣ.Sm.70.3; Sm.A. p. 70). 

A series of slokas attributed to Vyasa follow. Tryambaka introduces them by emphasizing the first ruling given. 'Sexual intercourse with one's husband should not be performed with wet feet.'[^18] The relevant śloka reads as follows. 'If a woman makes love with her husband when her feet are wet, she deprives her husband of long life and goes to hell herself.'[^19] This ruling is applied elsewhere to men as well as women. Manu VI.76, for example, rules that one should eat with one's feet still wet (i.e. from the purificatory sprinkling; ārdrapādas tu bhunjīta; cf. Vis.Sm.68.34) but one should not make love with wet feet (nārdrapādas tu samviset). ‘Make love' (samviśet) is glossed by the commentators as 'sleep' (sayīta, Sarv.; supyāt, Kull.; cf. nārdrapadaḥ supyāt, Vis. Sm.70.1; Sm.A.p.70, etc.). However, paintings of Rādhā having her wet feet dried by a maidservant (e.g.Randhawa 1962: plate X) are obviously more piquant if the first meaning is assumed. On these grounds, I suspect that the young bride described by Sinha (1980:123) as having her feet massaged is in fact having her wet feet properly dried. 

The next two ślokas (also attributed to Vyāsa) return to the subject of the wife's attire. ‘If a woman makes love with her husband while wearing a bodice, she will certainly be a widow in three years or even sooner. If a woman (dayitā; lit. "beloved") makes love with the "palm-leaf" type of earrings (talapattra) dangling from her ears, she will be a widow in this life within five or seven years, '[^20] 

The reasons for both rulings seem self-evident. Regarding the first, we may recall the earlier requirement that a woman should always cover her breasts (section IIA, p.90, note 69). The rule that she should remove her bodice for love-making reinforces the idea that women of this class usually wore bodices in public. In Tryambaka's circles at least, it seems that a woman's naked breasts were more likely to be associated with sexual intimacy than with fashion or custom.

[[242]]



A glance through paintings depicting high-class men and women will demonstrate their fondness for ornaments. Women in particular wore elaborate earrings, nose-rings and hair ornaments (e.g. Randhawa 1962: plates VII, XI, figs. 11,68; cf. Śahendravilāsa V. 33-42,VI.216). Even the naked woman pictured in her husband's embrace wears a mass of jewellery at her wrists, ankle and throat, in her nose and ears, and on her forehead (e.g. plates 12, 13; cf. Randhawa 1962: plate III). The 'palm-leaf" earring-also mentioned in the Kādambarī (Kād. II.28; MW 1976:445)—is evidently a particularly large, pendent ornament that might impede the intimacy of lovers. 

The next sloka (also attributed to Vyasa) deals with the lifting of certain important prohibitions for the duration of love-making. 'Allowing one's body to touch (lit. "cling to") the (other's) feet, (eating the other's) left-overs (ucchiṣṭam), blows, anger, rage and reproaches-in love-making, none of these is wrong.'[^21] 

As explained earlier, touching someone's feet is a formal gesture made by an inferior to his or her superior (gurūṇām abhivādanam; section IIC, pp.157-60). While it is proper for a wife to touch her husband's feet, therefore, the reverse is unthinkable except in the special context of love-making. Lifting this prohibition makes all kinds of intimacies possible: from the man throwing himself at the woman's feet in an extravagant gesture of adulation (pādapatanam, Kām.III.2.11; cf. Upadhyaya 1981: plate XXVIII) to a variety of otherwise impossible positions for sexual intercourse (Kām.II.6.1 ff.). Paintings even show the woman touching the man's head with her foot as a form of rebuke if, for example, he mentions another woman's name (Upadhyaya 1961: plate XLIIa; Sinha 1980:91). 

Similarly, eating the left-overs of someone else's meal (ucchistam) is a sign of one's own humility in relation to that other person. Again, while it is proper for the wife to eat her husband's left-overs, the reverse is normally condemned (cf. pp.221-7). Lifting this prohibition allows not only eating from the same dish (as at the time of marriage) but also the intimacies of drinking wine or taking food directly from the lover's mouth (e.g. vadanena tāmbuladānam; Kam.III.2.12). 

[^21]: pādalagnatanus caiva hy ucchiṣṭam tādanam tatha / kopaḥ krodhas ca nirbhartsā samyogeṣu na doṣakṛt / Sdhp.20v.8-9 (Vyāsa) < ? 

 

[[243]]

With regard to physical blows, it is generally agreed that a husband may beat his wife if she has done something wrong (e.g. Manu VIII.299-300; but not on the head or chest, Medh. and Kull. on Manu VIII.300). The reverse is inconceivable. In contrast, a woman must control her thoughts, words and actions (manovāgdehasamyatā, Manu V.165,166; cf. Gaut.I.9.3; Yajñ.I.87). She should never answer back even when she is scolded (ākruṣṭāpi na cākrośet) nor show her anger or resentment even when she is beaten (tāditāpi prasīdati, Sdhp.23r.4-5, from section IV, pp.273-4; cf.Sk.P.III. 2.7.18) or if her husband takes another wife (Manu IX.83). In lovemaking, such prohibitions are swept aside. As a result, the manuals on the art of love have produced detailed classifications of the permitted types of scratching (Kām.II.4), biting (Kām.II.5) and striking (Kām.II.7). Sexual intercourse becomes an erotic 'quarrel'; striking one's partner a sign of passion. Vātsyāyana's description of 'love quarrels' (pranayakalaha) is to the point: when a woman is (or pretends to be) jealous, a great quarrel arises; she cries, becomes angry, strikes her lover, pulls his hair, kicks him repeatedly on his arms, head, chest and back, and rebukes him with harsh and reproachful words (Kām.II.10.40-6). Indeed, it is said that lovers in the throes of passion are impervious to pain (Kām.II.7.1ff.). These elements are frequently recorded in poetry and art. For example, the eight types of lady-love (nāyikā) include the woman who, having quarrelled with her lover, sends him away (abhisandhitā or kalahāntaritā; cf. Randhawa 1962: fig.40); and the one who reproaches her lover bitterly for sleeping with another woman (khaṇḍitā; cf. Randhawa 1962: fig.42). Tryambaka's point is that such behaviour, normally forbidden to the good and submissive wife, is acceptable in the privacy of making love. 

The next sloka, also attributed to Vyasa, reads as follows. 'Kunkuma, collyrium, haldi power (haridrā) and sandalwood paste, clean clothes and betel-each brings happiness (and is therefore auspicious) in love-making. '[^22] The ointments, powders and pastes— all mentioned in Tryambaka's section on getting dressed in the morning (IIA, pp.96-7), constitute the signs of the happily married woman. Clearly, the ideal wife will be as carefully dressed and perfumed for the evening as she is at the beginning of the day (see plates 2-5). 

[^22]: kunkumam cañjanam caiva tatha haridracandane dhautavastram ca tambulam samyogeṣu subhavaham ji iti / Sdhp.20v.9-10 (Vyasa) <? 

 

[[244]]

According to Vātsyāyana, she will come to the 'pleasure room' freshly bathed and dressed (Kām.II.10.1). After they have made love, they will each go separately to wash, returning to chew betel together and to apply ointments to each other's bodies (Kām.II. 10.13-14). 

Tryambaka's last point, both in this section and in his treatment of daily duties as a whole, is to lift one more prohibition for the purpose of love-making. 'There is nothing wrong in wearing dark blue (nila) clothes when making love.'[^23] 

This relates to a prohibition that is normally couched in the masculine and therefore apparently applies to men. As I have already shown in the section on getting dressed, the male snātaka is repeatedly enjoined to wear white garments and not dyed ones (raktam, Gaut.I.9.5; sarvān rāgān vāsasi, Āp.I.11.30.10). Āp.I.11. 30.11 also prohibits cloth that is naturally black (krṣnam ca svā- bhāvikam; such as kambala, a kind of woollen cloth, Ujj.). Dark blue cloth, that is, cloth dyed with indigo (nīlam, nīlīraktam) is both specified for sūdras and forbidden to higher varnas (see section IIA, p.89). 

Tryambaka's quotation is attributed to Apastamba. ‘If a brahmin puts on his body a garment that has been dyed dark blue, he must sit day and night (without eating) and then purify himself by (drinking) pañcagavya.'[^24] The purifying properties of pañcagavya are discussed in section IIA (pp.59-60). A later sloka from the Āpastambasmṛti, not given by Tryambaka, adds that if one sits down to eat while wearing blue garments, one must undergo the cāndrā- yaṇa fast (Āp.Sm.VI.8). Tryambaka merely gives the exception. "There is no sin attached to women (wearing dark blue garments) in bed during love-making just for fun. '[^25] 

This suggests that the prohibition regarding dark blue clothes normally applies to both men and women but, for women, it no longer applies during love-making. Certainly, women are portrayed in both poetry and art wearing dark blue as they emerge from the

bedroom in the morning (e.g. Randhawa 1962:186, plate XX, cf. plate III). The associations attached to the colour presumably reinforce the intimacy of the scene. The idea that this same sari should not be worn during the day recalls a similar rule for men in the Apastambadharmasutra: one should come together (for sexual intercourse) when wearing a garment (reserved) for (making love to) women (strīvāsasaiva samnipātaḥ syāt, Ap.II.1.1.20; glossed by Ujj. as stryupabhogartham vasaḥ; by Sm.M.I.p.77 as strīsamyogārthavāsasā). As the Ujjvalā explains, the issue here is that one should wear the right thing at the right time (evakaro bhinnakramah). Thus one should not wear the garment one makes love in when performing sacrificial ritual and so on during the day (na tena ... brahmayajñādi kṛtyam). In principle, this ruling would seem to apply to women as well as men. 

Having produced rulings for almost every activity in a woman's day, from the moment she wakes in the morning to the garments she should wear at night, Tryambaka finally brings this lengthy and detailed section to a close. 'These are the daily duties (of women).'[^26]
