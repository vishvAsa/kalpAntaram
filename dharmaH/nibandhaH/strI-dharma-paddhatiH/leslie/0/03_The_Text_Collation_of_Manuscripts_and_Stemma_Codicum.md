The Text; Collation of Manuscripts and Stemma Codicum

The following MSS were available for comparison:

T1 The Tanjore Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library, Thanjavur

TD Vol. XVIII (1934), p.8708-9, cat. no. 18966; Burnell (1880) p.139a, no. 315; Oppert Vol. II (1885), p.471, no.8107; CC Vol.I (1891), p.241; NCC Vol. VIII (1974), p. 284.

Paper MS; devanāgarī script; 94 folios numbered 1-88; 9 inches by 5 inches; 10 lines to a page; 28–32 akṣaras to a line; complete.

This MS is in good condition although folios 2 and 88 are torn at the edges. It is clearly written with bold strokes forming square upright characters. Two hand-drawn lines on each side of each page form margins; except in folios 1 and 2 where each margin consists of two pairs of lines, and in the inserted folios 26(1) and 26(2) which have no margins. The word strī is written in devanagari in the top left-hand margin of the verso of most folios; the word dharma in the top right-hand margin of the verso of some of the earlier folios; and the pious ejaculation rāma in the bottom right-hand margin of some folios (e.g. 2v,3r,4r). There are frequent corrections: the smaller ones, in the margin, of a syllable, word or phrase, are usually in the first hand (e.g. 2r,3r,4r,30r); the longer ones written at the top or bottom of a folio and marked at the beginning and end with a number, are often in a more spidery second hand (e.g. 6v,15v,17r,25v); while some other longer ones are probably in a third hand (e.g. 39r,39v,48v,67r).

In addition, there are three lengthy insertions into the original text. Between folios 26 and 27, three extra folios are to be found: 26(1), 26(2), and 26(3); all three to be inserted at 26v.9. Folio 26(1)r is totally illegible, but has evidently been rewritten in the same hand on one side of a displaced and unnumbered folio. This replacement folio and 26(1)v are written in the spidery second hand: 26(1)r (replacement) has 13 lines to the page, 32-8 akṣaras to a line; 26(1)v has 94 lines to the page, 30-40 akṣaras to a line. Folios 26(2) and 26(3) seem to be in the first hand but are neater and more evenly spaced: 9, 9, 8 and 6 lines to a page; 26-34 aksaras to a line. The other two major insertions involve one folio each. Between folios 46 and 47, there is an extra folio 47(1) written in the second hand: 14 and 11 lines to the page; 25-38 akṣaras to a line; to be inserted at folio 46v.3, before the bracketed deletion. Finally, between folios 66 and 67 (the latter has the number 68 added in the second

[[332]]

hand), there is an extra folio 67(1) written in the same second hand:10 (+ 1} insertion) and 94 lines to the page; 28-32 aksaras to a line; to be inserted at 66v.10, before the bracketed deletion. These extra folios account for the inconsistency of 94 folios numbering 1-88 as described. (For an additional folio insert outside the passages chosen for comparison, see section V, note 3).

T2The Tanjore Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library, Thanjavur

TD Vol.XVIII, pp.8708-9, cat.no.18967; Burnell p.139a, no.316; NCC unpublished files.

Paper MS; devanāgarī script; 65 folios numbered consecutively; 15 inches by 7 inches; 12-13 lines to a page; 38-42 akṣaras to a line; complete.

This MS is in good condition and in one hand throughout. The script is small, even and compact; and there are few corrections, either in the margin (e.g. 19v) or otherwise (e.g. the bracketed deletions on folio 20r.8-10). The top left-hand corner of the verso of each folio contains either the word strīdharma (e.g. 5v,6v,8v), or the word stri (with or without dharma in the right-hand corner; e.g. 2v,3v,4v,7v), or nothing (e.g. 13v,26v,27v); the verso of folio lv has strīdha in the top left-hand corner, rma in the top righthand one. There are no margins.

Incipit, folio 1v.1-2: śrīgaṇādhipataye namaḥ śrīsarasvatyai namaḥ śrīguru bhyo namaḥ mukhyo dharmasmṛtiṣu vihito bhartṛśiśruṣaṇam hi...

Collation of Manuscripts

[[333]]

Paper MS; devanāgarī script; 60 folios numbered consecutively; 15 inches by 7 inches; 12 lines to a page; 40-6 akṣaras to a line; complete.

This MS is in good condition and in one hand throughout, possibly the same as in T2. The script is small, even and compact, with few corrections (e.g. 2v,18r, 18v). The word stridharma is written in devanagari in the top left-hand corner of the verso of each folio; the word strī in the top left-hand corner of 60r; and the ejaculation rāma in the bottom right-hand margin of (usually the verso of) some folios (e.g. 4v,8v,9v). There are no margins.

M— The Mysore Government Oriental Library, Mysore

MSC Vol.III (1955), p.704, serial no.9474, MS no.A 163; listed in the NCC files incorrectly as Strīdharmasangraha.

Paper MS; devanāgarī script; 38 folios numbered consecutively; 33 inches by 19 inches; 33 lines to a page; 22-4 akṣaras to a line; complete.

This MS is in excellent condition and in one hand throughout. The script is extremely neat and small, with very few corrections (e.g. 1r.3, 1v.24). It is presented on vertical pages in book format, suggesting a more recent origin than those in Thanjavur, but the pages are numbered as folios (i.e. lr,lv,2r, 2v etc.). Each recto has a devanāgarī numeral written in the top centre, and the equivalent roman numeral stamped in the top right-hand corner. On some folios, strīdharma is written beneath the devanagari numeral in the top centre (e.g. 13r,17r etc.). There are no margins.

Incipit, folio 1r.1: (Top centre, in place of the devanagari numeral:) //śrī// strīdharma// (line 1:) śrīgaṇeśaya namaḥ|| mukhyo dharmasmṛtiṣu vihito bhartṛśiśruṣaṇam hi...

initial stages of my research. It was copied by Srimati P.S. Lalitha, Sanskrit copyist, and checked by Srimati S. Rājalakṣmī Sanskrit paṇḍitā, both of the Tanjore Maharaja Serfoji's Sarasvati Mahal Library, Thanjavur. (For a description of this copy, together with incipit and explicit, see Leslie 1983(2): appendix A.)

I was unable to locate the MS entitled Stridharmasangraha that is listed in the NCC files as part of a collection to be found in the Fort, Vizianagaram Estate, Andhra Pradesh. It is described as a paper MS, damaged, and in Telugu script. The NCC entry is based on a typed list available to the compilers.

A printed text (PT) entitled Tryambakarāyamakhinibaddhā strīnām āvaśyikā dharmapaddhatiḥ, complete with Tamil translation, was also available. 275 pages; 8 inches by 44 inches; 12-14 lines of Sanskrit and, below these, 12-18 lines of Tamil translation; modern typesetting with indentations for verse, quotation and paragraphs; opening invocation omitted, otherwise complete.

I found two copies: one in the Kuppuswami Sastri Research Institute, Madras (accession no. 5881; undated but received between 1949 and 1956; part of the collection donated by M. Subramaniam Iyer of ‘Amrtavilas'; front and back covers missing); the other in the Vedadharmaparipālanasabhā, Kumbakonam (no accession number or date; complete). Neither copy bore any information regarding editor, translator, publisher, printer, place or date. However, His Holiness Candrasekharendrasarasvati informed me in December 1981 that it was edited and translated into Tamil in approximately 1917-20 by Pañcapageśasastri of the Kañci Kamakoṭi Math, the younger brother of Ganapatiśāstrī, the well-known editor of the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. Unfortunately, Pañcapageśaśāstrī's son, N. Ramani Sastri, has been unable to substantiate this. At all events, the edition is a useful one, well printed, and with comparatively few errors. It has formed the basis of my collation of the above MSS.

Before embarking on an analysis of the text, it was necessary to establish a stemma codicum setting out the relationship between the four extant MSS available to me: T1, T2, T, and M. Selecting the same three passages from each MS, I compared each in turn with PT; that is, the opening section (PT 1–10), the closing section (PT 271-5), and a central portion chosen because in T1 (25v-27v) it involves two hands, a lengthy insertion into the text, and an unnumbered misplaced folio (PT 73.3-84.10). The precise details of the collation process, including examples of the errors and variants noted are to be found in appendix A of my doctoral thesis (see Leslie 1983(2):352–67). A much abbreviated version is presented here.

Collation of Manuscripts

[[2]]

[[335]]

A comparison of the collations of PT with T, and T2 respectively reveal that T2 is an apograph of T1. Apart from a large number of shared errors and variants, several errors are both unique to T, and explicable only by reference to T1. Conclusive proof is provided by T2 20r.8, where the scribe-after copying an entire inserted folio-reverts to the place of the original insert (T, 26v.9) and copies the remaining two lines. Realizing his mistake, he then cancels those lines by bracketing them, copies the other two folios yet to be inserted, and then returns to those two lines once more.

A similar examination of the errors and variants of T, and T, reveal that the latter is also an apograph of the former. Again, apart from numerous shared errors and variants, several are both unique to T, and explicable only in terms of T1. In addition, few errors or variants shared by T2 and T2 are not also shared by one of the other MSS. Contamination is therefore slight.

[[2]]

The relationship between T, and M is only marginally less obvious. Once again, there are numerous shared errors and variants, some of which are also shared by T2 or T3 or both. However, some are exclusive to M and can be seen to originate in T1. M is thus also an apograph of T1. In addition, several errors and variants are shared by T2 and M but not by any of the other MSS. Somewhat fewer errors and variants are shared by T, and M but not by the other MSS. The stemma is therefore as follows:

[[3]]

い

T2

T.

[[3]]

M

TO and PT remain.

An examination of TO confirms that T, was the only extant manuscript consulted.

[[2]]

PT is evidently the work of an editor rather than the usual copyist for the majority of obvious errors present in T, have been corrected. Of the variants and remaining errors, none are shared with M alone, none with T, alone, none with T2 alone, some with T, in common with other MSS, and a few with T1 alone. There are, however, a large number of variants not shared by any of the extant MSS. Since these seem to be largely intentional rather than due to scribal error, there is no need to posit a lost exemplar between T, and PT. I have therefore assumed a simple stemma as follows:

[[1]]



[[336]]

I'

T2

T3

M

PT

TO

Since this is a closed recension consisting entirely of apographa, I have dispensed with T2, T3, M and TO except in cases where T1 is illegible or unintelligible. I have therefore used T, as my basic text, while noting the variant readings of PT.

Orthographic peculiarities (e.g. md, mt etc. for nd, nt etc.; ch for cch, vanhir for vahnir) and unimportant slips (e.g. śiśrūṣaṇam, gomasya, viśepi) have been silently corrected. Conventional sandhi (e.g. kīrtir, kartavya etc. for kirttir, karttavya etc.; ah + s for as; as+c for aḥ + c; ih + sa for is + sa; ñ + c for m + c), and punctuation (e.g. yatnato 'piha for yatnatopiha) have been restored. Angle brackets excise; square brackets supplete.

There remains only the question of whether T, is itself a copy or the author's autograph. Since too many of the errors noted in T, can only be explained as the results of misreading by a copyist (see Leslie 1983 (2): appendix A), we must posit at least one, if not more, previous exemplars.

To clarify this supposition, a close examination was made of the three major insertions in T1. They are as follows:

[[1]]

A: T1 26v.9 (three folios) >PT 77.7-84.5;

B: T, 46v.3 / 48r. 1 (one folio) > PT 143.4–147.4;

C: T, 66v.10/67 (1)r.9 (one folio) >PT 208.6-210.3.

The second and third folios of A are probably in the first hand (see above). The writing styles of B, C, and the first folio of A, although not identical, are sufficiently similar to suggest the same second hand, but perhaps on different occasions or with a different instrument.

We already know that T, is a copy. Were the insertions also copied from an exemplar? Were they perhaps the result of a second (e.g. comparer's) reading, specifically intended to correct mistakes and reinstate lost passages? Or were they original interpolations added to T1?

Collation of Manuscripts

[[337]]

There are several reasons to assume that the insertions too were copied, not composed. First, given the scribal traditions of India, it is highly unlikely that any scribe would presume to make such radical alterations to a religious, and therefore sacred, text. Secondly, insert A is begun by the second scribe and completed by the first; hardly likely if original work were involved. Thirdly, several errors in these interpolated passages are clearly the result of misreading rather than slips of writing.

Assuming then that both T, and the insertions were copied, were they copied from the same exemplar? If they were, then the disruption of the numbering sequence suggests that these passages were somehow lost in the initial transcription and reinstated later. But an examination of the insertions themselves shows that this is unlikely. First, the passages are improbably long. Secondly, none of the 'omissions' are the result of saut du même au même as is the case in many smaller insertions (e.g. T, 25v.8).

I suggest therefore that we are dealing with one of two things. Either this transcription is the result of copying from an exemplar that kept its interpolated folios at the end where they would not have been seen until later. Or, as seems more likely, it is the result of copying from (a copy of?) the author's first draft and, on discovering (a copy of?) a second draft, of making the appropriate alterations later. If the latter is the case, then the alterations constitute original emendations to the text, not merely the scribe's usual correction of mistakes. Equally, if this is the case, then T1 should make sense without the emendations. A brief examination of the interpolated passages demonstrates that this is in fact so.

In the case of A, three entire folios are inserted into the middle of one line. Without the insert, the argument on stridhana makes sense. The insertion merely develops the argument further, in some instances using material already quoted to make another point. None of the first version is deleted.

In the case of B, the insertion of one folio coincides with an extensive deletion in the first version. If we ignore the former and restore the latter, the argument still makes sense. In fact, much of the deleted passage is reinserted (i.e. T, 46v.5-10 >PT 146.6-147.4); of the rest, some phrases are dropped altogether, while some are reproduced but in a different order and considerably enlarged (i.e. T, 46v.3-47(1)v.7>PT 143.3-146.6). This new portion is a complete rewriting of the old. It covers the same ground (prohibitions relating to the widow, specifically sexual intercourse with another man according to the practice of niyoga), but includes two new purvapakṣa objections and refutations (T1 47r.1ff, 47v.5ff.; PT 143.3ff., 146.5ff.).

In the case of C, the insertion again coincides with an extensive deletion in the first version. If we ignore the former and restore the latter, the argument concerning a wife's obedience to her husband (specifically when she is required to do something that in normal circumstances she would not be allowed to do) continues to make sense. The deletion (i.e. T1 66v-67/68)



[[338]]

begins with a small example of saut du même au même : from ata eva sarvam api (PT 208.6) to ata eva sudarsanopākhyāne (PT 209.3). Of the rest, some is dropped altogether, and some is reinserted but in a different form. An added complication is that a large portion of insert C is itself deleted (i.e. T, 67v.2– 10) and very little of this is to be found in either the first (i.e. pre-insert) version or in the refurbished insert C.

(The same is true of the additional insert described in section V, p.307, note 3. Without it, the treatise moves coherently from the story of the pigeons and the bird-catcher to that of Kausika and the brahmin woman. The insertion – now in fact missing from T1-provides the entire story of Hariścandra.) I conclude that the stemma codicum is in fact something more like this:
