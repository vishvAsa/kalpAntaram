26. Brhaspati 

That Bphaspati was an ancient teacher of Arthaśāstra follows from the Kauṭiliya, wherein the Bārhasratyas are cited six times. In the Mahabharata (Sinti. chap. 59. 80-85) Brhaspati is said to have compressed into 3000 chapters the work on dharma, artha and kāma composed by Brahma. The Vanaparva ( 32. 61) speaks of Brhaspati-niti. The Maha bhārata several times cites verses (yrithas or slokas ) said to have been sung by Brhaspatia80 ( vide Sinti. 23. 15, 56. 38-39, 

79 The Budha sitra opens as follows :- अथातो बुधधर्मशास्त्रं व्याख्या 

स्यामः । श्रेयोभ्युदयसाधनो धर्मः । गर्भाष्टमे ब्राह्मणो वसन्त आत्मानमुपनयेत् । एकादशे क्षत्रियो प्रीष्मे । द्वादशे वैदयो वर्षासु । मेखलाजिनदण्डकमण्डलूपवी तानि धारयेत् &c. हेमाद्रि ( परिशेष, काल, p. 309) quotes this as 

Budha's from स्मृतिमहार्णव. 280 भूमिरेतौ निगिरति सर्पो बिलशयानिव । राजानं चाविरोद्धारं ब्राह्मणं चाप्रवा

57. 6-7). Vide also santi. 58. 13-16, 69. 23-24. The Anu sāsana ( 39. 10-11) speaks of the Arthaśāstra composed by Brbaspati and others. In some of these places there are dist inct references to a śāstra or mata of Bșhaspati and sections of his work are referred to (as e. g. rājādhikāra ). The Sānti parva (170. 12) describes how a king could, according to Bphaspati's views, secure his goal in four ways.281 In the Vanaparva ( 150. 29 ) men are said to be upheld by the nayas proclaimed by Bșhaspati and Usanas. Vide also Sabhā 50. 9, 55. 6, 73. 7-8, Udyogu 33. 71-72, 55. 66. The Kamasutra repeats the tradition that Brahmā composed a work in one bundred thousand chapters on dharma, artha and kama and that Bphaspati dealt with a portion of that work, viz. on artha.383 Vide note 238 above. Aśvaghofa (Buddhacarita I. 46 ) speaks of the rājaśāstra of Sukra and Bṛhaspati. Accor ding to the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya some of the special views of Bșhaspati's school were that there were only two vidyās for kings viz. vārtā and dandaniti and that the council of ministers should comprise 16 members. According to Kāman. daka and the Pancatantra ( II. 41 ).aviśvāsa ' was the sheet anchor of royal policy according to Bșhaspati. The Yasasti laka ( p. 13 ) says that the niti of Bphaspati had no place for Gods.283 The commentary on the Nitivākyāmrta gives the first verse of Bṛhaspati.384 Viśvarūpa contains several prose quotations (which from their context must have been taken from Brhaspati ) about the qualifications of a senāpati, prati hāra, duta &c. It is somewhat strange that in this quotation the mantrin is required to be deeply conversaut with the bāstras of Manu, Bșhaspati and Ufanas. For similar prose quotations, vide Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 323, II. 154. That Bșhaspati also wrote a sūtra work on Vyavahāra and other topics of dharma follows from the quotations contained in

Viśvarupa and Haradatta. For example, Viśvarupa cites a prose passage from Brhaspati (on Yaj. II. 38 ) about the duty. of the king to restore property stolen from his subjects if he could not recover it from the thief, about the rising scale of the rates of interest according to the castes; about the debts of a deceased man being payable by those who took his wealth, by his wife or by his son ; about a surety being made to pay when the principal died; about the illegitimate son of a sūdra getting a share on his father's death and about his taking the whole estate with the king's permission if there were no legitimate issue of the sūdra.285 Haradatta on Gau tama. 22. 18 quotes a prose passage from Brhaspati on the prāyaścitta for killing a cow. These quotations establish that Bphaspati wrote a sūtra work on dharma also (i. e, at least on vyavahira and prayascitta). Viśvarupa also quotes a few verses from Brhaspati on vyavahāra and prāyaścitta and in one place at least indicates that the verse he attributes to Bșhaspati occurred in the same work in which a prose passage quoted by him occurred. 288 From this it follows that the sūtra work of Rphagpati on dharma contained verses also in Viśvarāpa's time. Whether the two works on arthasāstra and dharma were composed by the same Brhaspati cannot be determined. It looks probable that they were composed by different authors. Yaj. (I. 4-5) mentions Brhaspati among the expounders of dharma. He is probably referring to the sūtra work an dharma disclosed by quotations from Viśvarupa. 285 तथा च बृहस्पतिः 'चोरापहृतं तु सर्वेभ्योन्विष्यार्पणीयम् । अलाभे स्वकोशाद्वा। 

अददच्चोरकिल्बिषी स्यात् ।' on याज्ञ. 11. 38; तथा च बृहस्पतिः-पादो पचयात् क्रमेणेतरेषाम् इति on याज्ञ II. 39 ; बृहस्पतिश्च धनस्त्रीहारिपुत्राणां पूर्वाभावे यथोत्तरमाधमयं तदभावे क्रमशोन्यपां रिक्थभाजाम् । on याज्ञ. 11 47; तथा च बृहस्पतिः-उपस्थाप्यविपत्तावुपस्याप्यस्य पुनः प्रतिभूर्दाप्यः-इति । on याज्ञ. II. 55 ; तथा च बृहस्पतिः-' कामतश्च शूद्रावरोधजस्य भ्रातुरंशं संमान 

मात्रं प्रेते पितरि दद्युः शुश्रूषुश्चेत् ' इति । on याज्ञ. II. 138. 288 On याज्ञ. III. 282 विश्वरूप says 'बृहस्पतिना तु द्वादशाहेन गोघाती तस्मा 

त्या गत्प्रमुच्यते। क्षीराहारो भवेत्तत्र क्ष रदध्यशनोपि वा ॥' ; तथेदमन्यत् 'गायत्र्या दशसाहस्र &0. ( two verses)' । तथेदं तत्रैवान्यत् 'द्वादशरात्रं पश्चगव्याहार षडरात्रं वा यावकाहारो गोष्ठे वसेत् । ... ब्राह्मणान् भोजयित्वा शुध्येदिया बृहस्पतिः' इति । The words द्वादशरात्रं पश्चगव्याहारः are attributed sty बृहस्पति by हरदत्त also.

In the Mit. and other commentaries and nibandhas over seven hundred verses on vyavahāra and a few hundred more on ācāra und prayascitta are cited from Bṛlaspati. That seems to have been an independent work composed between 300 and 500 A. D., which will be discussed later on (vide sec. 37). 

In Jivananda's collection (part I. pp. 644-651 ) and in the Anandāśrama collection there is a Bșhaspatismṛti in 80 verses in which Brhagpati is represented as instructing Indra about gifts. Several mss. in the Deccan College Collection contain this smrti, but in an abridged form in 70 and 49 verses (No. 130 of 1884-86 and No. 147 of 1895-1902). Vide also I. O. cat. p. 386 No. 1324, 1325-1328. Apararka quotes (p. 1225 ) verse 7 of this smrti (in verse ) and the Dānaratna kara quotes verses 6 and 7 as from Dana-Brhaspati. 

The Barhaspatya Arthaśāstra edited by Dr. F. W. Thomas (Lahore, 1921 ) is a later work and does not deserve more than a passing notice. In six chapters it deals with the con duct, duties, studies of kings, omens, rules of policy &c. 

27 Bharadvāja and Bhāradvaja Dr. S. C. Banerjee in his work ( Dharmasītras, a study in their origin and development) published in 1962 at Calcutta quotes only three prose passage of Bharadvāja. Although he publishes his work thirty years after the first vol. of the H. of Dh. he does not mention two prose passages which had been cited on pp. 126, 127, of that volume. 

There is a Srauta sūtra and a Grhya sūtra attributed to Bhāradvāja. The Ms. of the sranta in Bombay University Library contains nine praśnas and a portion of the 10th and begins' darśapaurṇamāsau vyakhyāxyāmah.' It quotes Ale khana and Āśmarathya frequently. The Gyhya has been edited by J. W. Salomons. It appears from quotations iu Viśvarūpa and other early commentators that a sūtra work on dharma attributed to Bharadvāja or Bharadvāja was in existence. The forms Bharadvāja and Bhāradvāja probably refer to the same work. On Yaj. ( 1. 15 ) Viśvarūpa quotes a prose passage from Bhāradvāja prohibiting the learning of mlecchu tongues and calling upon the preceptor to teach his pupil pure words
