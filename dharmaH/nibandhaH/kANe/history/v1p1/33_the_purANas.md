are the sources ( means) of Vidyo and of Dharma. It would be noticed that the 14 sources are arranged by Yājñavalkya in a rising scale of importance and authoritativene88.460 The word Purāṇa ( a class of works ) occurs in the Atharvaveda (XI. 7. 24, XV. 6. 10-11). The Sat. Br. (XI. 5.6-8 ) includes 

Itihasa puranam' among 'Svādhyāya' and furtber states ( XIII. 4. 3. 13 ) that on the 9th day of the Pāriplava ( an item in the Rājasūya sacrifice) the hotr priest narrates some Purāṇa. The Tai. Ār. II. 10 mentions Brāhmaṇas, Itihāsas, Purāṇas, Kalpas etc. ( Brūhmannitihāsān Purānāni Kalpan, Gāthā Nārāśamsih). In the Chandogya Upanisad ( VII. 2 and 4 ) Itihāsa--Purāṇa is spoken of as the fifth Veda and the Brbadāranyaka Up. (IV. 1. 2 ) separately mentions Iti hāna and Purāṇa. The Āśv. Gr. includes Purāṇāni under 'svādhyāya !.461 

It is not unlikely that originally there was only a single work called Purana. The Mahābhāṣya ( Kielhorn, vol. I p. 9) uses the word Puranam and the Matsya (chap. 53) states that ori. ginally the Purīna was only one. But since the Tai. Ar. emp. loys the word 'Purīnāni' in the plural it appears likely that there were in the times of the Aranyaka at least three (if not more) works called Purana. A verse quoted below-Purāṇam Mānavo dharmah etc.-'462 occurs in many copies of the Manus mrti after XII. 110 and is mentioned by the Tantravārtika on Mimāṁsāsūtra 1.3.27 p. 286 ( Anan. ed., first half). 

From early times the Puranas have been enumerated as eighteen ; vide H. of Dh. Vol. V pp. 831-836. The number of upa purāṇas varies from a few to several dozens.

The Purāṇas, as a class of works, were looked upon us encyclopaedias for all men and women as to ancient and medi val Hindu religious practices, mythology, geography, his tory of persons, families, royal dynasties and literature. 

The chronology of Purāṇas is, like that of the Epics, . subject full of perplexing problems and is not dealt with in this revised edition of the first volume of the H. of Dh, as it has been discussed at length in the H. of Dh. Vol. V. pp. 815 1002 and the views of Pargiter, Kirfel, Dikshitar and Hazra have been set out, discussed and criticized at length in pp. 831-853. Vide also the present author's paper Paurāṇa dharma'in Gode commemoration volume pp. 70-82 for the changes in religious ideas and practices brought about by the Purāṇas or reflected in them. 

It has to be mentioned here that in the first few centuries of the Christian era the idea prevailed that those rules or ordinances ( Dharmas ) that were understood from the Veda are the highest (in authority ), but the rules ( Dharmas ) stated in the Purāṇas ( and similar works ) were inferior.468 This posi tion assigned to the Puranas was changed a few centuries before 1000 A. D. and Purāṇas came to be far more relied upon by works on Dharmaśāstra. For example, the Kr̥tyakalpa taru (about 1125-1160 A. D.) quotes the Purālas even on such a topic as Mokoa much more than the Upaniṣads or the Vedāntasūtra. Aparārka quotes a half verse*** as from Menu ( not found in extant Manusmrti), saying that one should strengthen the Veda by Itibāsa ( i. e. Mahābhārata ) and Pura uas. It is significant that the extensive commentary of Vigvarūpa on Yāj. hardly ever mentions a Purāļa by name, though he twice refers to Purāṇas in a general way on Yaj. III. 170 and 175. He flourished about 800-860 Ą. D. Simi. 453 अतः स परमो धर्मो यो वेदादधिगम्यते । अवरः स तु विज्ञेयो यः पुराणादिषु

larly, Medhātithi on Manu very rarely refers to Purāṇas and mentions none by name. Vide notes below.486 

The main characteristics of the teachings of the extant Purāllas, some of which at least were composed in the first few centuries of the Christian era would be merely indicated here briefly. Those who want to go into greater details are requested to refer to Vol. V of the H. of Dh. pp. 928-980. North and Central India had been harassed by the invasions of foreign hordes such as the Sakas and Hūnas. Besides, the performance of Vedic sacrifices had become rare; Buddhism, Jainism and other schisms had greatly affected the minds of all persons including religious and thoughtful men. The leaders of Hindu Society had to wean away common men from the new and attractive teachings of Buddhism and hence the writers of Purāṇas struck upon finding out new dogma. The first doctrine that was recommended was that great rewards ( spiritual and other-worldly ) would follow on a little

trouble and effort.466 

Dāna (charity and gifts) came to be regarded as conferring the highest rewards in the Mapusmrti ( 1.86 'tapah param... dānamekam kalau yuge'), in Santiparva, Vāyupurāṇa (6.65 66), Parāśarasmști (1. 23). The gifts of food ( and particu larly to brāhmaṇas ) were regarded as highest. When the invasions by foreigo hordes were frequent and when rulers of different kingdoms in India itself engaged in constant warfare this idea was good enough 

Even the Rgveda (X. 117. 6 ) condemns one, wbo offers no food to Aryarnan (and other gods ) nor to a friend (guest etc.) and feeds himself alone, eating only sin. The same idea (almost in the same words ) occurs in Manu III. 18, Viṣṇusmrti 67. 43 (aguam sa kevalam-bhunkte yah pacutyatmakārunāt) and the Bhagavad-gitā (III. 13 ). But the Purūnas carried this idea to extreme limits. Manu prescribed that in rites in honour of gods and pitrs, even a single learned brāhmana may be fed to secure the full reward of the rite, but not many brāhinnnas who do not know the mantri18. Again, in 111. 149 Manu says that in rites for gods no close examination about a brāhmana should be indulged in, but that in rites for ances tors effort should be made to ascertain that the family and character of the brahmanas are both good. But gradually this idea was given up, particularly at Sraddhas in Gayā. For example, the Vāyupurāṇa states that the brāhmaṇas of Gaya are supermen, that when they are gratitied (at a Srāddba) the gods together with the pitṛs become gratified, that no question should be raised about their fainily, their character, learning or tupas and that by honouring them a man attaine liberation. 

It may be pointed out that the Vanaparva (chap. 84. 82-104 ) speaks at length about Gaya and its holy places, most of which are quoted in the Padmapurāya, Adik bauda, chap. 38 ( verses 2-19). Those interested may consult H. of Dh. Vol. 1 V for detailed statements about Gaya. 

Auother important change in beliefs and practices mirror ed in the Purāṇas is that of pilgrimages to holy places and baths in holy rivers us destroying the effects of even the most 468 349aa aa at ptecnica e gate faruqaro VI. 2. 24

heinous sing.467 For example, the Anusāsana parva ( 25. 42) says-' In Gayā a man is purified even of the sin of three murders of brahmanan, if he visits Asmaprstha (Pretasilā in Gayā ), the hill called Niruvinda and the Kruuñcapadi. We find even the Vannparva stating that one does not secure those rewards even by performing solemn sacrifices in which fees paid to the priests are large, as one secures by pilgrima ges to holy places. 

Another development for which Purāṇas are largely responsible is that of numerous observances called Vratas (described in vol. V part 1 pp. 81-462). It makes one sad to find that a great minister of State in the latter half of 13th century A. D., Heinsidri, deals with nearly 1000 vratas in about 2500 printed pages, instead of pondering over the great menace of invasions against India by foreigners from the 11th century onwards and does not take or even suggest methods or means to counteract that evil. 

Another important aspect dealt with by soine Purāṇas is that of bhakti' (devotion to God ) and Ninasmarana (repea ting inaudibly the names of God). The word Bhakti in its technical sense of loving faith in and surrender to God does not occur in the early Upanisaids, but only in the Svetāsvata ropanigad VI. 23 (yasya deve parī bhaktir-yathā deve tathā gurau ). It is developed in the Bhagavadgitā (as in IX. 27 aud 34, XI. 55 ), and in the Bhagavata, Visųu and other Purā ŅAs. The subject of bhakti has been treated at some length in H. of Db. vol. V pp. 950-980. 

Prof. Hazra in ludiau Culture' vol. I. pp. 587-614 con tributes a learned paper on · Purāṇas in the History of Smrti' and at the end of the paper sets out several nibandhu works on Dharmaśāstra in which Purana passages are quoted and relied upon. 

His treatment of the subject is, however, not exbaustive. To take only one instance. As regards quotations from

Purāuas in the Mit. he cites only one quotation from the Matsyapurana (chap. 94 ). But the Mit. quotes several Purāṇas on Yāj. For example, on Yāj. III. 30 it quotes a verse from Brahmāuda purāṇa which is also quoted by the Smrticandrikā. On Yāj. I. 297-98 the Mit. quotes two verses from Matsya purāṇa ( 93.11-12) on the position of the planets on a diagram or painting of planets in Grahapūjā. Matsya ( 93.33-37) prescribes the same four Vedic mantras that Yaj. prescribes (in I. 300-301 ) for the worship of the Sun, Mars, Saturn and Ketu. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 6 prescribes the offering of Nārā yanabali for those that commit suicide and states that the procedure is described in Vaiṣnava (purāṇa ?). On Yāj. III. 6 the Mit. quotes from the Bhaviṣyat-purāṇa providing, for death on serpent bite, to a brahmana reciter of Purāṇas the gift of a golden serpent made from one bhara of gold. The Mit. on Yāj. II. 290 refers to the view of the Skandapurana that there were veryūs that belonged to a distinct caste. It appears to quote the Mārkandeya purāṇa several times on Yaj. 1.238, 254, III. 19, 287. Thus the Mit. mentions by name only six Purāṇas, while Aparārka naines twenty Purāṇas and Smrti-candrikā 22. 

In all about 40 Puranas and Upa purāṇas are quoted in Nibandhas. 

Purāṇas have been published by different individuals, presses and societies. A critical edition of at least the eighteen Purāṇas based on Mss. collected from all parts of our country had long been a desideratum. But only recently the work of re-editing Purāṇas in a critical manner by collecting and consulting Msg. from the whole of India has been under taken by the Purana Prakāśana Samiti of the All-India Kashiraj Trust, Benares. The work which is under the general guidance of Dr. V. Raghavan, Dr. V. S. Agrawala and Panditarāja Sri Rajesvara Sastri has been going on for some time. With the help of the new Catalogus Catalogorum of Dr. V. Raghavan, a complete list of the Mss. of the Purāṇas and the Upapurāṇas has been prepared. The work of bring ing out a critical edition of the Matsyapurāṇa has been going on in Madras under the guidance of Dr. Raghavan and the work of the critical edition of the Vāmana purana has been undertaken by Dr. V. S. Agrawala at Benares. The semiti mentioned above has been also bringing out a Bulletin Calle Purāṇa, which publishes only Purāṇic studies by different 

35. The Purāṇas 

416 

scholars aiming at the elucidation of the textual and other problems relating to the subject-matter embodied in the Purāṇas. 

The preparation of a subjectwise encyclopaedia of Purāṇic material, publication of popular expositions of Puranas in English or Hindi are among the lines of work that are includ ed among the objectives of the Purāṇa Prakāśana Samiti. The subject-concordance of six Puranas viz. Kūrma, Linga, Matsya, Mārkandeya, Viṣṇu and Vūmuna is also ready (at the end of 1964). 

For the critical edition of the Matsyapurāṇa, Dr. Raghavan is relying on more than thirty mss., all printed edi tions and an old Tamil translation. Besides, as each indivi. dual Purāṇa is closely connected with many other Purāṇas and is almost all Purāṇas have numerous common topics, Dr. Raghavan is using the other Puranas for parallel portions contained in them. As Purāṇas have been quoted in numerous Dharmagāstra works, Dr. Raghavan has collected all quote tions from the Matsya-purāṇa in nibandha works on Dharmasastra. His plau of work on the Matsya has been set forth in his Presidential Address at the 21st session of the All India Oriental Conference held at Srinagar in 1961. 

As the project of the critical editions of the Purāṇas is a long-term one, Vyāga Institute on a permanent basis at Benares is going to be established in the near future. 

The constitution of the original text of the purāṇas is a Herculean task which has not yet been attempted. Not only is there difference of opinion among the purāṇas about the Dames of the 18 Maha-Purāṇas, but there is divergence as regards the extent of the several purāvas. For example, the commentator Viṣṇucitta of the Viṣṇupurāṇa says (on III. 6. 20-22 ) that the extent of the Viṣṇupurāṇa is variously given at 8000, 9000, 10000, 22000, 24000, but that he comments on a text of 6000 slokas only. The Agnipurāṇa ( 272.10-11 ) says that it contains 12000 slokas, while the Bhāgavata (XII. 13 ), the Brabmavaivarta, the Padma (ādi. 62 ) say that it contains 15400 slokas and the Skanda (V. 3) and the Matsya 53 giver the extent of the Agni as 16000. The Kūrma, according tortice the Bhagavata, contains 17000, according to the Matsya 18700 and only 8000 according to the Agni ( 272. 19). Though there is a remarkuble continuity in India as to religious thought

and practices, yet the popular religion of modern Hindus is pre-eminently paurīnic. The Purīvas contain thousands of slokas on dharinaśāstra matters, they are a rich mine awaiting exploration by careful students of social and religious questions and shed a flood of light on the deve 

f light on the development of reli gious beliefs and practices in meilieval and modern India. Therefore, the re-constitution of the text of the purāṇas is a problem that will have to be tackled in the near future. Be sides the several Mahāpurīnas, eighteen Upapurāṇas also are enumerated in some of the Puranas. Vide Garuḍa (223.17 ff),488 Skanda (V. 3. chap. 1. 45-62 and VII. I. char. 2), Padma (Pātāla-khanda chap. 111. 95-98 and Matsya ( 53. 59 ff) for Upapurāṇas. The Matsya-purana (chap. 53, verse 58 ) states that the 18 purāṇas reached in extent four lakho of verses and also states that there were upabhodus (i.e. Upapurāvas ) and names some of them viz. Nārasimha, Nānda, (Nandam), Samba and Aditya. Besides the Malõpurāṇas and Upapurāṇas, there are other works of the purīna class such as Ganesa, Maudgala, Devi, Kalki &c. The Padmapurana (Uttarakhanda chap. 263 ) divides the 18 Purāṇas into three groups, sāttvika, rājusa and tāmesa and says that the Visuu, Nāradiya, Bhā gavata, Garuḍa, Padma aud Varāha are sāttvika. The Matsya ( 53 ) also speaks of this division. The Lingapurīna (39. 63 66 ) speaks of the twenty expounders of dharma just as Yājñavalkya does and quotes the two verses in the form in which the Mit. presents them (and not Viśvarūpa ), while the Padma (Uttarakhanda 263. 86-89 ) divides the eighteen gmṛtis into three groups of sāttvika, rājasa and tāmasa. 480 It would be quite clear to any reader of the purāṇas and the smrtis that most of the former in their extant form are later than the smrtis of Manu, Yājṅavalkya, Parāśara, Nārada &c. 458 3fotografa A: afirana OI 377F ARTTTH ARTHEAUT

33. The Purāṇas 

417 

The following table will give some idea as to how the eighteen principal purāṇas are rich in dharmaśāstra material. Besides the eighteen principal purāṇas, the Kālikā-purāṇa (Venkateśvara press ed.) and the Saura-pura (Ananda srama ed.) have been drawn upon. The Anandāsrama editions of the Agni, Pauma, Matsya and Vāyu and the Niruayasagara edition of the Bhagavata and the Venkatesvara Press editions of the other Purīnas have generally been relied upon in the present edition of the 1st volume. 

It may be stated here that the Smrti chapters in the Puranas are very much influenced by Manu, Yāj., Nārada and mostly by the first.
