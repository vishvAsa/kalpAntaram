12 The Dharmasūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita


12. The Dharmasutra of Saṅkha-Likhita From the Tantravārtika we learn (note 55 above ) that the Dharmasūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita was specially studied by the Vājasaneyins ( the followers of the white Yajurveda ). The Tantravārtika also quotes a few words from thnt Dhar. masūtra which constitute an Anustubh pada.138 The Mahā bhārata ( in Sāntiparvan, chap. 23. 18-43 ) narrates the story of the two brothers, Saṅkha and Likhita, who resided in sepa rate dwellings surrounded by trees. Once Likhita came to the ābrama ( hermitage ) of Saṅkha in his absence. He took some ripe fruits from some of the trees of Sarkba's aśrama and ate them. While he was eating, Saikha came and asked him where he got the fruits. Likhita smiled and told his brother that he took them from his trees. Then Sarkha got angry and told his brother that he was guilty of theft and asked

him to go to the king Sudyumna for punishment. Likhits went to the king who would not punish him as he was a man of pure character and learned ; wheu he persisted the king ordered his hands to be cut off. His arms were restored when he plunged into the river Bāhudā. In Santi ( 130.29 ) 132a it is said It is not possible to live if one adopts Saṅkhalikhita mode of life, particularly when one intends to secure the pro tection of the subjects.' In another place (Santiparvan 132. 15-16 ) it is said 'Some hold that conduct or practice is the best characteristic of dharma, others to whom Saṅkha-Likbita are dear do not like them.' Vide Sabhāparva 7. 11 where among the holy sages who graced Iudra's sabhii are included Saijkha and Likhita. 

In the Pāli Dighanikāya II. 40-41 we have the words "Sakhalikhita - brahmacariyam caritum'. Prof. Bapat in the Silver Jubilee Vol. of BORI. ( 1942 pp. 61-66 ) tries hard to prove that the words Nayidam sukaram agāramajjhi vasatā ekāntaparipumpam ekāntaparisuddham Saṅkha likhitam-brahmacariyam caritum' occurring in the Dighani. kāya (2nd sutta, 40-41 ) have nothing to do with the Dharmasūtrakāras. The word 'brahmacariyam' does not mean in Pali books the life of a Vedic student, but only a pure moral life here (that was to be led by a student in brahmanical society ). But the words quoted from the Digha are just like the words quoted by me above from the Mahābharata (Santi 130. 29 ). My own idea is ( whatever the date of Sakha-likhita as writers may be ) that the Pali story is based on the story in the Mahābhārata. It is not unlikely that the two had led or emphasized an excellent moral life. Thereafter, the redactors of the Mahābhārata included them in a story in the Santiparva and the Pali

writers included the gist of that story in their works. Just as it is difficult to assign a definite date to the Mahābhārata, so also it is impossible or at least as difficult to say (there being no reliable evidence) that all the Nikāyas existed in writing before Asoka. Yājṅavalkya ( I. 5) mentions Saṅkha Likhita among the writers on dharmaśāstra. The Parāsara smrti says (I. 24 ) that in the four ages of Kṛta, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali, the ordinances of Manu, Gautama, Sarkha-Likhita and Parāśara are respectively of paramount authurity in matters of dharma. Viśvarūpa (on Yāj. III. 248 ) quotes a verse from an ancient author which says that Saṅkha and Likhita pondered deeply over the dharma promulgated to the sages by Manu and drew upon the Veda188 also. From the gist of the passages of Sarkha Likbita quoted by Viśvarūpa and the words ‘Pratijñātārtha virodhah syāt' it appears to have been the view of Viśvarūpa that the verse quoted was the first verse (or one of several verses at the beginning) of the sūtra of Sarkha-Likhita. The word Manu-bhāsitam'in note 133 was either introduced by some redactor at a later date or the word does not refer to the extant Mapu, but to some earlier version of it. Commenta tors and nibandhakaras from Viśvarūpa downwards profusely quote Sarkha-Likhita. A considerable portion of these quota tions is in prose. Hence it is quite clear that the dharma sūtra of Saṅkha--Likhita is an ancient one, that it was largely if not entirely in prose and that it was once easily accessible though it has not yet been discovered. In the Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (vol. VII-VIII) I made an attempt at a reconstruction of Saṅka-Likhita. 

Jivananda (collection of smrtis, part II, pp. 343-374 ) prints in 18 chapters and about 330 verses a smrti of Saṅkha and a smrti of Likhita in about 93 verses ( part II., pp. 375– 382 ). The Anandāśrama collection also prints the same text of the two smrtis. The latter also contains a Laghu-Sarkha smrti in 71 verses and a Sarkha-Likhita-smrti in 32 verses. All these, except perhaps the Saṅkha-smrti in 18 chapters, are late compilations. The smrti in 18 chapters seems to have been compiled very early. About fifty verses from it are quo

ted by the Mitāksarī. In the 11th and 12th chapters occur a few prose passages, one of which is quoted even by Medha tithi. The numerous prose quotations ascribed to Saṅkha Likhita do not however occur in these smṛtis. One point deserves special notice. Comparatively early writers some times ascribe the same text to Saṅkha-Likhita or to Saṅkha simply. The well-known sūtra about succession to a son less man ( athāputrasya svaryātasya bhrātrgāmi dravyam &c. ) is ascribed to Saṅkha by Viśvarūpa and the Mṛtākṣarā, but to Saṅkha-Likhita by Aparārka (on YĀj. II. 135-136 ). Similarly, the sūtra 'pitaryasakte kutumbavyavahārān jyes thaḥ '&c. is ascribed to Saikha by Aparārka and to Saṅkha Likhita by the Vivāda-ratnākara, Dāyatattva and Madana parijata. Quotations ascribed to Likhita are few and far bet ween. Some passages are ascribed by some writers to Saṅkha and by others to Likhita. For example, a prose passage 

Uddhrtya pariksitābhiḥ' &c. is ascribed to Likhita by Apa rārka ( on Yāj. I. 18 ) and to Saṅkha by Viśvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 20 . and by the Viramitrodaya ( Āhnika prakāśa p. 68). Similarly, the sutra 'ubhābhyamapi hastābhyām prānmukho devatirthena kuryāt' is ascribed to Saṅkha--Likhita- by the Pārāśaramadhaviya : I. 1. p. 352 ) and to Likhita by A parārka (on Yāj. I. 101). The relation of the Saṅkha-smrti in verse to the dharmasūtra of Saṅkha seems to be this. The former is based upon the latter and is a versified paraphrase or adaptation of portions of the dharmasūtra. 134 

The versified Sarkha shows a tendency towards greater strictness. The dhormusūtra allows a Brāhmana to marry a woman of any of the four castes, while the verse Saṅkha resti icts him to the first three custes. 136 It is not unlikely that the dharmasūtra contained a few verses as is the case with Baudhāyana, Apastamba and Vasiṣtha. Even so early a

writer as Viśvarūpa looked upon the prose and verse portions as the composition of the same author (vide his comment on Yāj. III 237, and Aparārka pp. 1149, 1154, 1161 ). 

The dharmasutra of Saṅkha-Likbita was commented upon early. Laksmidhara in his Kalpataru (Ghose's Hindu Law vol. II. p. 504 ) draws attention to the fact that the bhāsya kāra of Sarkha read a well-known sūtra as 'sa yadyekaḥ syat' instead of 'sa yadyekaputraḥ syāt. ' Vide Kalpataru ( vyavahārakānda ) p. 654 (sa yadyekaputraḥ syāt ) and f. n. 6. Lakṣmidhara flourished between 1100-1160 A. D. as he was a minister of Govindacandra of Kanauj. The Vivāda ratnākara ( 1314 A. D.) also cites the bhāsyakāra of Saṅkha... Likbita. The Vivādacintīmaṇi (p. 67 ) quotes from the bbaṣyakāra of Sarkha-Likhita. 

The dharnasūtra of Saṅkha-Likhita would appear, from the quotations in the nibundhus, to have closely resembled the other extant sūtras on dharma in style and contents. It embraced almost all the topics treated of in Gautama or Apastamba. It agrees very closely with the words of Gau tama and Baudbāyana in several places.138 It is curious to note that a quotation from Saṅkha containing the names of writers of smrtis cites Sarkha-Likhita as authority. 137 

The dharmasūtra seems to have permitted niyoga, speaks of twelve secondary sons, and did not favour (like Apastamba ) the claims of females to succeed to males. On certain points the dharmasūtra of Sarkha marks a more advanced state of opinion than is the case with Gautama or Apastamba. Sarkha speaks of several kinds of ordeals and appears to have contained elaborate prose rules about thern (vide Aparārka on Yāj. II, 95; Smṛticandrikā II, p. 112, Viramitrodaya, p. 270).

12. The Dharnasūtra of Sarkha-Likhita 141 Sakha-Likhita gives more detailed information than Apastamba or Baudhāyana. The limits of Aryāvarta188 stretched over wide areas according to Saṅkha (i. e. to the east of Sindhu-Sauvīra and to the west of Kāmpilya ) than is the case with Baudhāyana ( I. 1. 25 ) or Vasistha ( I. 8-9). The style of Sarkha reminds one of Kautilya rather than of Gautama. The quotations hardly exhibit any upgrammatical forms. It is noteworthy that Yājñavalkya is included among the authors of smitis by Sarkha ( vide note 137 ). If it is the extant Yajnavalkya-smrti that is meant to be referred to, then the dharmasutra of Saṅkha will have to be assigned to u late date. But this does not seem to be likely. From the fact that the Yājõuvalkya-smrti itself enumerates Saṅkha Likhita anong ancient authors on dharna, from the general style of the work, from the development of the legal concep tions it presents and from its doctrines about the rights of women, it appears almost certain that the extant Yājña vulkya-smrti is much later than the dharmasūtra of Saṅkhu. There are close correspondences between Sarkha and Yājfia valkyu.138 Saikha is quoted 99 times and Sajjkha-Likhita 63 times by Apararka. Ou Yūj. 111. 289-90 (p. 1154 ) Apa rārka first quotes Sarkha as 'Agnyutgādi samvatsarum Cāndrāyaṇam cared-gam ca dadyat' and five lines after wards quotes Saikha-likhita with the words 'Agnyutsādi mithyādhiti ca sarivatsarain brābmanagrhesu bhaiksyam caretām'. Kalpataru (Brahmacāri) quotes Saṅkha-Likhita 36 times, and Sarkha 19 times. From the fact that Saṅkha Likhita is quoted as including Saṅkha-Likhita among writers on Dbarmaśāstras it may be inferred that the original text was tampered with by some redactor. Kalpataru on Vyavahāra (pp. 830-31 ) cites a long prose passage of Saṅkha-Likhita on the proper avocations of the men of eleven mixed castes viz.

The prose quotations from Saṅkha-Likhita refer to the Vedāngas, Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Dharmaśāstra. Saṅkha recogni sed eight forms of marriage. The views of Saṅkha about the status of the offspring of mixed marriages differed from those of Baudhāyana (1. 8. 6 ) and Manu (X. 6) and were inter mediate between the latter two.140 The tarparu141 ( which resembles the one in Baudhayana, though it is more elaborate) refers to the six Vedāngas, Bhārata ( but not Mahā-bhārata ), to twenty writers on dharma and contains numerous details about geography, mythology, and cosmogony which are gene rally found in the Purāṇas. The dharmasutra frequently cites the opinions of others. It mentious by name the views of Prajāpati, Angirasa and Usanas ( Vivādaratnākara p. 537 ), Prācetasa (Vivādarat. p. 557-560 ), Vṛddha-Gautama ( Mada na-pārijāta pp. 701-2). The verse quotations ascribed to Saṅkha further mention Yama, Kātyāyava and Saṅkha him self. But in drawing chronological conclusions it is better to leave the verse quotations out of account. The saine verses are ascribed to Manu and Saṅkha242 and a few sūtras closely resemble the Manusinfti.143 Six identical verses occur in the Vasistha-dharmasūtra (21. 10-15) and in the Saṅkha smrti ( 10th chap. ). 

All these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the dharmasūtra of Saṅkha is probably later than Gautama and Apastamba but earlier than the Yājṅavalkya-smrti and 80 must be assigned to some date between 300 B.C. to 100 A. D.
