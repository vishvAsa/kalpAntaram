61. Viśvarupa The commentary of Viśvarūpia called Bālakrīdā on the Yājsavalkya-smrti has been recently published in two parts by M. M. T. Ganapati Sāstri in the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series. The Mit. states in the introductory verses that the dicta of Yij. were expanded by the voluminous or ample (vikata ) explanations of Viśvarūsra. In commenting on Yāj. 1. 81 the Mit. tells us that Viśvarūjia looked upon the words of Yāj. I. 79 ( tasmin yugmāsu saṁviset ) as a niyama. In Viśvarūpa's commentary on Yāj. I. 80 (evam gacchan &c. ) we do find that the verse of Yāj. and similar passages of Manu (3. 45 ), Vasistha and Gautama ( 5. 1 ) are understood to contain a niyam and not a prescinkhyu.?!! On Yāj. III. 24 the Mit, inforins us that Viśvarūpa, Medhātithi and Dhāre svara looked upon certain texts of Rsyasriiga on āściucu as in conflict with well-known sinitis and discarded them. Mr. S. Sitaram Sūstri published (in 1900 at Madras ) the text and translation of Viśvarūpia's comment ou inheritance and Mr. Setlur also published the wavahūrco section. In the following pages the Trivandrum edition is relied on. 

The printed com. of Viśvarūpa on the vyavaharu section is extreinely meagre and scarcely merits the epithet vikata applied to it by the Mit. But the commentary of Viśvarūpa on the ācāra and grīyascitta sections is truly voluminous and coinpares favourably with the Mit. The style of Viśvarūpa is simple and forcible and resembles that of the great Saṅkarā. cārya. He quotes profusely from Vedic works, mentions the Carakas and Vājasaneyins (on Yaj 1. 32 ), the Kathaka (on Yaj. III. 237 and 243 ) and very often supports his position by quotatious from the Rgveda (e.g. on Yāj. 11. 121 and 206 ), the Brāhmanas (e. g. the Sata patha on Yāj. 1. 53 and III. 257 ) and from the Upanisads (e. g. on Yāj. 11. 117, the well-known

Chandogya passage about the ordeal for theft and on Yāj. I. 50 Chandogya II. 23. 10 about the three branches of dharma). He speaks of the pada-rātha and the kramapātha as due to human agency (on Yāj. III. 242). He frequently quotes the Grhya sūtrus of Pāraskara and less frequently those of Bhāradvāja and Asvalāyana. lle cites a host of smrtikāras.712 Most of the quotations attributed to Svayambhū are found in the extant Manusmrti, but this is not the case with the quotations ascribed to Bhrgu (vide pp. 309, 310 above). Most of the quota tions from Brhaspati (even on such topics as repayment of debts, sureties, the rights of sūdrāputra ) are in prose, only a few being in verse ( e. g. & verse about ordeals on Yāj. II. 117, a verse about the method of partition on Yāj. II. 153 ). Ou Yāj. I. 307 Viśvarūpa quotes a long prose passage from Brbaspati in which the qualities required in a Senāpati, Pratihāra, Hastyadhyaksti, Asvādhyalist, Dūta, Mantrin and Uparika are set out at length. It appears, therefore, that Viśvarūpa either knew a work of Brhaspati in prose on arthaśāstra in which occurred a few verses or he had before him a prose work of Bṛhaspati and a versified smrti of Bṛhaspati, both of which he regarded as the compositions of the same author. He quotes a verse (on Yāj. I. 328 ) from Visā lāksa, a well-known writer on politics quoted even by Kautilya. He refers to the arthaśāstra of Uśanas along with that of Bșhaspati. Kautilya is nowhere quoted by name. The learned editor of Viśvarūpa thinks (Intro. p. V) that Vißve rūpa took Bṛhaspati and Viśālākṣa as ārsa writers long anterior to Yāj. and therefore used their dictu to elucidate and support Yāj., while he omits Kautilya because he thought Kautilya to be posterior to Yāj. This argument contains several fallacies. In the first place it is wrong because Viśva rūpa quotes verses from Nārada and Kātyāyana to supple ment Yāj. There is nothing to show that Viśvarūpa regarded Nārada and Kātyāyana also as anterior to Yāj. and we have

seen above that they are several centuries later than the smrti of Yāj. Moreover Kautilya himself looked upon both Bphaspati and Viśālāksa as high authorities and so Viśvarūpa might have quoted them rather than Kautilya. Even taking the latest date assigned to Kautilya (about 3rd century A.D.) he flourished several centuries before Viśvarūpa. It is im possible to believe that Viśvarūpa was in possession of the exact chronological relation of Yāj. and Kautilya. Many scholars, besides, place Kautilya's work centuries before Yāj. It appears, however, that Viśvarūpa had the work of Kautilya before him. On Yāj. I. 307 he speaks of ministers tested by the four allurements (upachii) of dharma, artha, kūma and bhaya. This is an echo of Kautilya ( I. 10). On Yāj I. 343 Viś. refers to the view of some that a march should be made when neighbouring chiefs are overwhelmed in calamities.713 This is the view of Kautilya almost in the same words. On Yāj. I. 341 Vis. speaks of the inanifold aspects of the work of a minister, some words of his comment being almost identical with Kautilya's. 

Some of the verses on pp. 25-27, for example, the first verse ( govadham &c.) relers to Yaj. III. 234 ( where (govadha' is mentioned as the first among Upapātikas (51 in number ). On p. 26 he has a larika 'Smārtopi govadhostyarghyamarhayet prathamam gavi', which includes Mauusmrti III. 3 (last quarter ); on same page the words 

vedam-eva tvad:starthe...pramānam paramam dharme Srutir' embodies a part of Manu III. 13. The Karikū at the top of p. 27 quotes some words of Manu II. 10. 

Viśvarūpa's work is thoroughly saturated with the lore of the Pūrvamimiṁsā. He quotes Jaimini by name (on Yāj. I. 225 where Jaimini VI. 8. 15 is quoted ). Curiously enough

he applies the term nyāya to Mimāṁsā. He takes 'nyāya mimāṁsā' in Yīj. I. 3 as one vidyā, while he notes that others explain nyayu as the system of logic propounded by Aksa pāda. He quotes the sūtras of Jaimini as those of Yājñikas who know nynya (e. g. on Yāj. I. 53 be quotes Jaimini I. 3. 16 and on Yāj. I. 87 he quotes Jaimini VI. 8. 17). He applies the epithet Naiyāyikı, to a mīmāṁsaka like Sabara and speaks of the mimārsakas as nyāyavidaḥ.714 He mentions the Sūbarabhāsya by name (on Yīj. III. 243) and in in several places quotes the very words of Sabara (e. g. on Yāj. III. 181 ).716 He quotes the Slokavārtika of Kumārila (1. 12 the verse 'survasyaiva hi &c) in his introductory remarks. in his comment on Yaj. 1. 7 he cites over fifty verses in the nature of kārikis dealing with the relation of śruti and smrti and kindred topics. These verses are his own composition, as in one of them he assures us that a certain poiut will be dealt with by him in detail in the section on srāddha.710 Iu interspersing his coin mentary with kārikūs of his own and in their style and pithiness he greatly resembles Kumārila. Throughout his work he relies upon mimūinsā maxims and methods of discussion. For example, on Yāj. I. 4-5 he discusses the rule of Jaimini II. 4. 8 ft ( about 

sarvasākhūpratyayam ekam karmu') in its application to smrtis ; on Yāj. 1. 225 be relies upon the position that words like yuva and varalice are to be taken as employed in the Vedas in the same sense in which sistus use them (vide Jaimini I. 3.9); on Yīj. II. 144 be speaks of wealth ( dravya ) being puruṣūrthre, where he alludes to the well-known distinction between krutvartha and puruṣūrthu, the subject of Jaimini's 4th chap. His cominentary on Yāj.

'Though Viśvarūpa was a past master in Pūrvamīmāṁsā lore, his philosophical views seem to have been identical with those of the great Sajikara. According to him moksu results from correct knowledge alone and the whole samsāra is due to avidyu il? He quotes anonymously one of Gaudlapāda's kārikāsiis (III. 5 ) on Yāj. III, 134. 

He speaks on Yāj. III. 103 of Narada who knew the Veda of music ( gitivedavid ), of purāṇa ( on III. 175 ), and quotes verses (on Yñj. III. 85 ) from an abhidhūnukośu ( lexicon ) and from a Nāmaratnamila (on III. 266). He speaks of the sloka of Bhiksātana (on III. 60.). He is in this probably referring to the Bhikrītanakivya,719 which is mentioned by the Sahityavarpani. Amony commentators he mentions Asahaya's bhāsya on Gautama by name ( on Yāj. III. 263 ). On Yāj. III. 256 he explains Mleccha as pulindas and 

Tājikus ( i. e. Arabs ). 

It has been shown above ( $34 pp. 423-425 ) how Viśva rūpa's text of Yāj. varied in some respects from that of the Mit.; how he frequently refers to the views of commentators of Yāj. earlier than himself (in the words 'apare,''anye'), how he proposes several explanations of the same words in several cases. 

Dr. Jolly (Journal of Iulian History, 1924, pp. 7-8) says that the citations of Vis in the Smṛticandrikā about his having refuted the views of Dhireśvara cannot be traced in the printed Balakrida, as also the reference to Vis, in the Mit.

II. 135 it has to be noted that the Mit. - does not mention Vis. by name there, but only speaks of bhagavān ācārya, '720 which words are interpreted by the Subodhinī and the Būlambhatti as referring to Viśvarūpa. It is true that the printed Viś. does not contain in so many words the explana tion attributed by the Mit. to 'bhagavān ācārya.' But it is worth considering that in the printed Vis. the two quotations from Manu and Saṅkha do occur and are put in the mouth of an objector and are explained away in a way somewhat similar to that put forth in the Mit.721 As regards the passages of the Smrticandrikā, the matter requires careful examination. The Smrticandrika, (II. p. 294 Gharpure's ed.) says that according to the Samgrahakāra a widow was allowed to succeed to her souless husband's wealth if she submitted to niyoga, that the same was the view of Dhāreśvara and that Viśvarūpa refuted the view of Dhāreśvara. In no place does the printed Vis. name Dharesvara. The words of the Smrti candrika are uot to be taken literally. It will be shown below that the author, Devanmabhatta, flourished about 1200 A. D. while Dhāreśvara flourished between 1000-1050 A. D. Devanna had no correct idea of their relative chronological position. It has been shown above (p. 249 ) how though

Asahāya is named by the Mit., the Sarasvativilāsa very often says that Asahāya does not like ( or tolerate ) the views of Vijnanesvara. Similarly, the same work ( para 392 ) says that Dhāreśvara and Devasvāmiu do not tolerate the view of Vijñānesvara, but Dhireśvara is one of the predecessors of Vij. actually named by him. So all that the Smṛticandrikā means is that Dhāreśvara and Viśvarūpa differed in their views on the particular points mentioned by it. The word patni is taken by Viś. to mean a widow who is pregnant at the time of her husband's death and quotes the sutras of Vasistha and Gautama in support of his view as jñāpokas. So this view entirely differs from the view of Dhāreśvara that the widow of a sonless person succeeds if she submits to niyoga. The Smṛticandrikā (II. p. 300 ) says that the Samgrahakāra placed the father's mother immediately after the mother and before the father, that the Samgrahakāra relied on the same arguments that were employed by Dhāreśvara and that Viśvarūpa and others refuted those arguments. The passage in the printed Viś. is somewhat corrupt in this place. Vis. does place the mother before the father on the ground of the word nātā occurring first when the word 'pitarau' or the compound mātāpitruritu' is expanded. The comment does mention the verse of Man (9. 217 ) about the grandmother, but it makes no clear sense, as it stands.722 For the reason given above Rai Bahadur M. M. Chakravarti ( JASB for 1922, p. 345 and for 1915, p. 322 ) is not right when he places Vißvarūpa later than Bhojadeva because of the remarks of the Smṛticandrikā. 

In the works of Jimūtavāhana ( viz. the Dāyabhāga and the Y yavahāramñtrkā ), in the Smrticandrikā, the Hāralatā, and other later works like the Sarasvativilāsa, the views of Viśvarīpa are frequently cited and discussed. Several such citations have been already examined by me (JBBRAS for 1926, pp. 200-204 ). From considerations of space I do not repeat here the discussion of those passages.

Mss. Lib at the B. 0. R. Institute Poona, folio 133a ) the explanation of Viśvarūpācārya on Yāj. 1. 135 is cited, which does not exactly tally with the printed Vis. Hemādri724 refers to Viśvarūpa's: explanation given in his section on partition which does not occur in the printed text. The result of the examination of these citations is that the printed text of Vis. is in the main genuine, but that in a few cases (parti cularly in the vyavahāra section ) it is corrupt or deficient. 

Though Vis. holds the same view as the Mit. that owner ship does not for the first time arise on partition but that partition takes place of what is already (jointly ) owned, yet on numerous points the two disagree. A few of them may be set out here. 

(1) Vis allows ( on Yāj. II. 118 ) the father unrest rictd freedom of distribution of property among his sons during his lifetime, while the Mit. expressly says that this power of unequal distribution is restricted to self acquired property. 

( 2 ) Vis. ( on Yāj. II. 119 ) allows a share of property to the widows of predeceased sons and grandsons of a man when a partition takes place during his lifetime. The Mit. restricts the word 'patnyab' to the father's own wives when he effects a partition during his lifetime. 

(3) Viś. connects the words without detriment to the paternal estate'( in Yāj. II. 122 ) with the words 'whatever else is acquired by himself' and not with 'maitra' (gifts from a friend ) und udvihika' (gifts on inarriage ), while the Mit. connects the half verse whatever else is acquired by the man himself without detriment to the paternal estate as a

(5) Viś, appears to allow one share out of ten to the son of a sūlra wife from a brālmana without restriction of any kind, while Mit. restricts the share to estates other than land acquired by vist. 

(6) Viś. interprets the expression 'half share' (in Yāj. II. 138 ) with reference to the illegitimate son of a sūdra as meaning some portion, not necessarily exactly half.' while Mit. interprets it literally. 

( 7 ) Viś. allows a widow to succeed to her husband if she is pregnant at his death, while Mit. allows a widow to succeed without any restriction except that of chastity. 

(8) Vis restricts the word 'duhitarah’in 'patni duhitarascaiva' ( Yaj. II, 138 ) to putrilā only and so does not allow all daughters whatever to succeed, while Mit. does not introduce any such qualification 

(9) Vis. reads "anyodaryasya saṁsisti' for anyo daryastu &c. ' and 'sodaro' for samsrsto’in Yāj. 11. 143 and his interpretation of the verse is entirely different from that of the Mit. 

(10) Vis. reads "Ādhivedanikam caiva 'for "ādhiveda nikadyam ca' of Mit, and holds that bandhudatta, sulku and anvāllheyaku strīlhana of a childless woman goes on her death to her full brother; while Mit. connects these three with the preceding verse and takes the half verse 'atītāyam &c.' 88 laying down a general rule of succession to strīdhand of all kinds and interprets biudhavāh' us meaning 'husband and the rest'.

As Viśvarūpa quotes Kumārila's Slokavārtika and is mentioned by the Mit. as an authoritative commentator it follows that he flourished between 750 A. D. and 1000 A. D. A greater approximation as to the date of Viśvarūpa can be made, if the identity of Viśvarūpa with Sureśvara be held established. Sureśvara, as he himself tells us in the Naiskarmyasiddhi, the Taittiriyopaniṣad bhāsya vārtika and other works, was ā pupil of the great Saṅkarācārya whose generally accepted period is 788-820 A. D. Mādhavācārya in several works of his quotes as Viśvarūpa's passages from the the well-known works of Sureśvara. For example, the Parāśara-Mādhaviya ( vol. I, part I, p. 57 ) quotes a karikā of Sureśvara as that of Viśvarūpācārya.726 In the Vivarana prameyasaṁgraba ( Vizianagaram series p. 92 ) also Madhava quotes & verse from the Bșhadāranyakopanisad bhāsya vārtika as Viśvarūpa's.726 In the Purusārthaprabodha7a7 of Brahmānanda-bhārati (ms. in Bhau Daji collection, Bombay) composed in 1476 (probably of the Saka era ) the author speaks of the Naiskarmyasiddhi as a work of Viśvarūpa. In the Saṁksepa-Sarkara-jaya, Viśvarūpa is said to be the author of the two vārtikas on Sarkara’s bhāsya.738 According to tradition embodied in the various lives of Sarkara, the latter had four pupils, Sureśvara, Padmapāda, Totaka and Hastāmalaka. Several works mention Viśvarūpa as one of the four pupils and omit the name Sureśvara. For example, in the Dvādaśa-vākya-vivarana of Gopāla (Aufrecht's Oxf. Cat. No. 557, p. 227 b) the four pupils of Śhaṅkara are named as Viśvarūpa, Padmanābha, Totaka and Hastāmalaka. In the Mānasollāsa-vșttānta-vilāsa of Rāmatīrtba we are expressly

told that Sureśvara is another name of Viśvarūpa, a pupil of Śhaṅkara (vide Mitra's Notices vol. V, No. 1763,p. 82). In the Saptasūtra-sanıyāsa paddhati (Mitra's Notices, vol. VI, p. 296 ) the four pupils are said to be Svarūpācārya, Padmā cārya, Totaka and Prthvidhara. The Guruvaṁsakāvya (Vanivilas ed. ) identifies Suresvara and Viśvarāpa ( II.59) and makes him a pupil of Kumārila and Śhaṅkara. It may therefore be held as fairly established that Viśvarūpa and Sureśvara are identical. Some corroboration is afforded by the fact that Viśvarūpa quotes Gauda pāda the 'paramaguru' of Śhaṅkara and holds the same philosophical views as those of Sarkara. Just as Viśvarūpa quotes Kumārila's Sloka vārtika, Suresvara also in his Taittiriyopanisadbhāsya-vārtika quotes a kārikā of Kumirila and styles the latter Mimāṁ sakam-manya.729 This shows that Suresvara treated Kumarila with scant respect, which seems unlikely if he was at any time Kumarila's pupil. Viśvarūpa, in his introduction,730 performs an obeisance to the Sun, the great serpent (Sesa ), Tilakasvamin and Vinayaka. The Bhamati of Vācaspati--misra has a similar salutation. Vācaspati--misra wrote his Nyāyasūci-nibandha in 841-42 A. D. i. e. he was almost a contemporary of Śhaṅkara and his pupils. The learn ed editor of Viś. tells us that in a commentary on Viß. called Vacanamālā Sureśvara is bracketed with Maru and Yogisvara (Yajnavalkya ) as an expounder of Sastra (i. e. dharma sastra ).8l Therefore that commentator looked upon Vis. aud 729 मोक्षार्थी न प्रवर्तेत तत्र काम्यनिषिद्धयोः । नित्यनैमित्तिके कुर्यात्प्रत्यवाय.

Sureśvara as identical. From all these several considerations it follows that Viśvarūpa flourished about 800-825 A. D. But this problem presents further difficulties. The mutual rela tions of Sureśvara, Bhavabhūti, Umbeka and Mandana are a great puzzle. I have dealt with this question in JBBRAS for 1928, pp. 289-293. The conclusions arrived at there are that Mandana's literary activity lies between 690-710, that of Umbeka between 700-730 and Sureśvara's between 810-840 

A. D. and that Umbeka and Bhavabhuti are identical, but that Mandana and Sureśvara are separated by about 100 years, 

In the H. of Dh. Vol. V pp. 1188-1198 the present author has discussed at some length the relative chronological posi tion of Kumārila, Prabhākara, Sālikanātha, Mandanamiśra, Umbeka, Bhavabhūti, Viśvarūpa and Sureśvara and the conclusions relevant to Viśvarūpa are that Mandanamisra is not identical with Viśvarūpa, that Viśvarapa and Sureśvara are identical and that Sureśvara is the name of Viśvarūpa after the latter became a sunnyāsin. The grounds in favour of the identity of Viśvarūpa and Sureśvara are overwhelming as evidenced by the writings of great scholars like Mādhavācārya. 

An interesting matter about Viśvarūpa may be mentioned here. On Yāj. I. 162 / which is one of tbe verses that state the persons whose food should not be partaken of ), 'grāmayājin' is one ( who is abhojyūnnu ) and Viś. remarks that among the Mālavas a grāmayājaki is known as Vaiśva devika'. It is possible that Viśvarūpa was an inhabitant of Mālava ( roughly present Malwa ) or that he had stayed there for some years. 

Dr. Jolly has brought together in the Journal of Indian History ( vol. III. pp. 1-27 ) some valuable information about Viśvarūpa. 

In several later works a digest called Viśvarūpa-uibandha is frequently cited. That appears to be the composition of another Viśvarūpa altogether. For example, the ṣan-ụavant srāddhanirṇaya of Śivablatta (which is later than 160 A, D.) tells us that Viśvarūpācirya composed a vivurder

(commentary) on the Sraddhakalikā.732 The Kr̥tyacintāinani of Śivarima ( No. 221 of 1879-80 in the Govt. Mss. Lib. at the B. O. R. Institute, Poona 4 ) quotes several 33 verses from Viśvara panibandha on supinda relationship in marriage, which are not found in the Balakridā. but which agree 

remarkably with the words of the Mit. on Yāj. I. 53. The Varsakriyakaumudi (pp. 378, 380) mentions Viśvarupa nibandha and quotes two verses cited therein. The Tithi nirṇaya-sarvasamuccaya ( later than 1450 A. D.) quotes certain lcarileti.s of Viśvarupa on the 18 varieties of Ekadasi.734 The Kalanirṇayasiddhantavyakhya ( composed in 1653 A. D.) quotes certain verses of Viśvarūpa on the question of the disposal of food prepared for a marriage when a period of impurity on death supervenes.135 The Nirnayasindhu also quotes verses of Viśvarūjia. From these data it follows that a Viśvarūpa composed a commentary on Srāddhakalikā and also wrote a digest on matters of acara and other topics of dharma in prose and verse. Raghunandana in his Udvāha-. tattva (ed. by Jivananda, p. 116) names a Viśvarupa samuccaya. It is likely that it is the same as Viśvarapa nibundlhn.
