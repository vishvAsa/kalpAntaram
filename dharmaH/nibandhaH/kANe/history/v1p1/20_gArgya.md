20. Gārgya Viśvarūpa (on Yaj. I. 4-5) quotes a verse of Vṛddha Yājñavalkya in which Gārgya is enumerated among the expo unders of Dharma ( dharmavaktūraḥ). He quotes two sūtras, one from Gārgya ( on Yāj. I. 72260 ) and the other from Vṭddha Gārgya361 (on Yāj. I. 195). Therefore it seems that a sutra work of Gārgya on dharma did exist. The Mit. (e. g. on Yāj. III. 326 ), Aparārka and the Sinșticandrika quote several verses of Gārgya on õhnika, śrāddha and prāyascitta. Parā sara (I. 13) mentious Gārgya among writers on dharma. Apa rārka contains (pp. 124, 190, 368, 544 ) verses from Gārgya on topics of dharina. It seeins that the two writers are identical. Aparārka also quotes several verses from Gārgya of astrono mical import (e. g. p. 5:17 on the nomenclature of the months as Caitiu in connection with the signs of the zodiac). This was probably an independent work. Fragments of a Gārgi samhiti on astronomy and astrology have been recovered and it contains valuable historical information ( vide Kern's pre face. to Br̥hat-samhitā pp. 33-40 and Mr. Jayasval in JBORS. vol. 14, p. 397 (F). A Jyotir-Gārgya and a Brhad-Gārgya are quoted in the Smṛticandrikā. The Nityācārapradipa (p. 20, B.I.S.) mentions Garga and Gārgya separately as smștikāras.
