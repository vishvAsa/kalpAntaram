CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE

OF some important Sanskrit works and authors referred

to in volume IV

N. B.-Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are conjectural and disputed by several scholars. Most of the dates about authors from the 8th or 9th century refer to the probable periods of their literary activity except in the case of a few authors such as Sankarācārya and Vidyāpati. 4000 B. C.-1000 B, C.-The period of the Vedic Samhitas,

Brāhmanas and Upanisads. Some hymns of the Rgveda, of the Atharvaveda, and in the Taittiriya Samhita and Brāhmana may possibly go back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some of the Upanisads (even from among those that are regarded by most scholars as the earliest ones) may be later than 1000 B. C. Some scholars have criticized me for ascribing the ve sambitās to such an early date as 4000 B.C. Time and health permitting, I may have to deal with this question in a separate work after I finish the 5th and last volume on which I am now

engaged. 800 B. C.-500 B. C.-The Nirukta of Yaska 800 B. C.-400 B. C.-The principal srautasutras (of Āpastamba,

Asvalāyana, Baudhāyana, Katyāyana, Satyāsādha and others ) and some of the gặhyasutras (such as those of Apastamba and

Asvalāyana ) 600-300 B. C.--The Dharmasūtras of Gautama, Āpastamba,

Baudhāyana, Vasistha and the Gịhyasūtras of Pāraskara and a

few others. 600 B. C.-300 B. C.-Panini 500 B. C.-200 B. C.-Jaimini's Pūrva-mimamsa-sútra 500 B. C.-200 B. C --The Bhagavadgita 300 B. C.--Vararuci Katyāyana, author of Vārtikas on Pāṇini's
