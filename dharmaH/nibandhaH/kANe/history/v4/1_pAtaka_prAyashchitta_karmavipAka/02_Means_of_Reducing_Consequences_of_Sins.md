MEANS OF REDUCING CONSEQUENCES OF SINS

CHAPTER II

MEANS OF REDUCING CONSEQUENCES OF SINS

Confession-In Ap. Dh, S. I. 9. 24. 15, 1. 10. 28, 19, 1. 10.29.1 it is prescribed that the person undergoing a penance for being an abhiśasta or for unjustly forsaking his wife or for the murder of a learned brāhmaṇa has to declare his misdeed while begging for alms to support himself. The Vedic student who was guilty of sexual intercourse had also to proclaim his lapse while begging at seven houses (Gaut, 23.18, Manu XI. 122 ).98

Repentance (anutūpa)-Manu99 XI. 229-230 (=Vispudharm oftara II. 73.231-32 ) provide: "The more a man's mind loathes his own evil deed the more does his body become freed from the unrighteousness (committed by him). If after committing a sin a man feels repentance for having done it he becomes free from that sin. He becomes purified only by the resolution of ceasing to sin and thinking 'I shall not do so again". 100 The Visnupurāṇa II. 6.40 lays emphasis on repentance and humble devotion to Krspa. Pr. V. (p. 30 ) quotes a verse of Angiras "A man after committing sins, if he is consumed by repentance and is sorry day and night (for his misdeed), is purified by prānāyāma'. The view of digests like the Pr. Prakasa is that

98. Confession of sins has played a prominent part in early and medie val Christianity. For example, (First epistle of) John I. 9 says 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'.

99. Manu XI. 229 also occurs in tro 218. 5.

100. Compare Christ's call to repentance in Matthew 4. 17 and Mark I. 15 and his last words (in Luke 24. 47) that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations'. Ira FTET नित्यं दुष्कृतान्यनुचिन्तयन् । तपस्वी चाप्रमत्तश्च पापेभ्यः स प्रमुच्यते ॥ इति कल्पतरूदाहृत

repentance by itself is not enough to destroy sins, but that repentance renders the sinners fit to receive penance, just as paring the nails and the like make the person intending to perform a Vedic sacrifice fit to be a dikṣita. Yama quoted by Aparārka (p. 1231) states that repentance and stopping from repeating the sin are merely the angas ( subsidiary elements) of prāyaścittas and cannot independently take the place of penances,

Prāṇāyāma (restraint of the breath). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 317 for a description of this. Manu XI. 248 (which is the same as Baud. Dh. S. IV, 1.31, Vas, 26.4, Atri II. 5, Sankhasmrti XII.18-19 ) lays down: sixteen prāṇāyāmas attended by the Vyāhrtis and the Pranava (omkāra), if per formed every day, would purify after a month even the murderer of a bhrūna (a learned brāhmana). Visnu Dh. S. 55.2 (in prose) is to the same effect. Vas. 26.1-3 provide that on the proper performance of three prānāyāmas all the sins committed by day or in the night are at once destroyed. Yāj. III. 305 statas that for the removal of all sins, of upapātakas and of sins for which no special expiation is provided by the texts one hundred prānāyāmas should be performed. This refers to sins not known to others for which expiation is to be performed secretly. Baud. Dh. S. (IV.1,5-11) provides for varying numbers (3, 7, 12 ) of prāṇāyāmas to be spread over one day to a year for different kinds of sins ranging from the eating of the food of a sūdra to brāhmana murder. This whole passage is. quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III,305 which points out the kinds of sins it deals with. The Agnipurāṇa 173.21 has the same half verse as Yaj. III.305 (first half ).

Tapas (austerity). Even Rg. X. 154. 2 speaks of tapas as leading to heaven and as unassailable. The Chān. Up. V. 10. 1-2, Mundaka Up. I. 2. 10-11 place tapas over yajña. Gaut. 19.15 says that celibacy, 101 truthfulness, bathing thrice daily in the morning, at noon and in the evening), wearing wet clothes (till they are dried on the body), sleeping on the ground (on a raised part or altar) and fasting constitute austerities. Baud. Dh, S. III. 10.13 adds to these 'ahimsā' (non-injury to any being), astainya (not depriving any one of his property) and puru. sugrūṣa (attendance upon a teacher). Gaut. 19. 17 sates that

Tapas (austerities )

the periods for which tapas is to be observed are a year, six months, four months, three months, two months, one (month), 24 days, 12 days, 6 days, 3 days, a day and a night (according to the nature of the sin). Manu XI. 239-241 declare that those guilty of mahāpatakas and others guilty of evil deeds are freed from sins by well-practised tapas and that whatever sins are committed by people in thought, word and bodily actions are all quickly burnt by tapas. This doctrine is shared by th Jainas as stated in the Uttaradhyayana XXIX. 27 by austerities he cuts off karman' (S B. E, vol. 45 p. 166).

Homa (sacrifice into fire). The Tai. A. (II, 7-8) describes 102 the kūsmānda homa and diksa and II. 8 prescribes that the man who regards himself as impure should offer a sacrifice with the kūsmanda mantras (mentioned in Tai. A. II. 3-6, viz 'yaddevā deva-hedanam' (Vaj. S. 20.14-16=Tai. A. II. 3.1). The Mahārnava karmavipaka (folio 8 a) prescribes the procedure of Kūsmānda homa taken from Jamadagni which is brief. It is as follows: After shaving the hair on the head and the moustache and taking a bath in holy water one should offer the ajyabhāgas and then offer oblations of clarified butter with the three Anuvākas beginning with 'yad devā devahedanam,' and then he worships fire with the verses beginning with 'Vaisvānarāya pratipā. dayāni.' He then offers samidh with the mantra 'yadadiya. yam' and then he repeats the Jayā mantras. He has to observe the rules for a dikṣita viz. not eating flesh, avoiding sexual intercourse, not telling a falsehood and not sleeping on a cot. He has to subsist on milk (if he is a brāhmana), on barley gruel if a ksatriya and on āmiksā if he is a vaisya. The Kuṣmāṇda-homa as prescribed by Baudhāyana is a longer one. The Baud, Dh. S. III. 7,1 prescribes that he who considers himself impure should offer burnt oblations reciting the kūṣmānda mantras, that he who has had forbidden intercourse becomes even like a thief or evən like a slayer of a learned brāhmaṇa

and that (by performing homa with kūsmāndas) he becomes free from any sin that is less than the murder of a learned brāhmaṇa. Yāj. III. 309 provides that whenever a twice-born man feels himself mixed up in heavy sins he should perform a homa with sesame with the sacred Gāyatri mantra. The Mit. following a verse of Yama says that one lakh of offerings of sesame must be made. Both Manu. XI. 34 and Vas. 26. 16 say that a brāhmana becomes free from all distrasses by Vedic recitations (japa) and sacrifices (homa). When the wife con fessed to the existence of a paramour, the Sat. Br. II. 5. 2. 20 states that she made an offering into the Dakṣiṇāgni with the mantra (Vaj. S. IIT. 45) 'whatever103 sin we have committed, whether in the village, in the forest, in society or by the organs of sense, we cast that away by this sacrifice, svāhā.' Both Manu (VIII. 105) and Yāj. (II, 83) prescribe that when a witness tells a falsehood in order to prevent an accused person from be ing sentenced to death, he should offer for expiating his perjury an oblation of boiled rice to Sarasvati. There are other homas also prescribed such as the Ganahoma, in which such verses as 'agne naya supathā' from the Taittiriya sākhā are recited (Mahārnava).

The old idea of sacrifice seems to have been that it was propitiatory in character. Sacrifice was not demanded or required by God. Sacrifice was probably regarded as a gift which pleased God, induced Him to forgive a man for his transgressions and enabled erring man to regain God's favour which had been lost by some shortcoming or some sinful act. Sacrifices therefore had an expiatory or cleansing function or character. Sacrifices may be performd by offerings either an animal (meant as substitute for the sinner himself who had forfeited his life for his sins and transgressions) or a burnt offering or any other thing offered to God and then distri buted to others.

Japa (muttering of Vedic passages as prayers). Japa is of three kinds, vācika (audibly uttered), upārsu (inaudibly uttered) and mānasa (mentally revolved), each succeeding one being ten times superior, acc. to Laghu Hārīta IV, 186,

Japa (repeating Vedic prayers) (Jivananda I.).104 Śabara (on Jai. XII, 4.1) distinguishes japa from stuti, the former being simply an utterance or recitation of a mantra or mantras105. Inaudible japa is praised106 in Sānkhāyana Br. 14. 1. The Āśv. Śr I. 1. 20 provides that japa, anumantrana, āpyāyana and upasthāna are uttered upāṁsu. The Āp. Śr. (24. 1. 8-10 ) provides that mantras from the Rgveda and the Samaveda are uttered in sacrifices loudly and that passages of the Yajurveda are muttered upamśu and the Tai. Pratisakhya23.6 states that upāmsu recitation is made by means of the effort of speech organs but without sound (i.e. in a very low voice) and without the mind being directed (to utterance with udātta and other accents) i. e. 'Karanavad asabdam-amanah-prayogam-upamsu'. Gaut. 19.12(= Baud. Dh. S. III. 10. 10 =Vas.22.9) prescribes the following Vedic texts as purifiers: Upanisads, Vedanta texts, the Samhita texts of all the Vedas (and not the padapātha or kramapātha), the Yajus texts in which the word 'madhu' occurs, the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg.

X, 190. 1-3), the Atharvasiras, (the anuvakas called) Rudras, the Purusa hymn (Rg.x.90), the two samans called Rajata. and Rauhineya, the Br̥hat-sāma and the Rathantara, the Puruṣagati saman, the Mahānāmni verses, the Mahāvairāja (sāman), the Mahādivākirtya (sāman), any of the Jyestha sāmans, the Bahispavamāna (sāman), the Kuṣmāndas, the Pāvamānis (Rg. IX) and the Sāvitri (Rg. III. 62.10). 107 The

original idea of japa was highly spiritual. Deep knowledge of the Upaniṣads and other texts would have made the soul pure and enabled it to realize the supreme reality and induced in the mind love of all human beings as sparks of the one Divine Essence. Japa at the highest level was contemplation of God and endeavour to attain unity with God. The habit of repeat ing the sacred texts should lead to maintaining the soul in the presence and thought of God. Japa demands three things, purity of heart, detachment and placing oneself in the hands of God.

Manu XI. 46 provides that a sin unintentionally committed jsexpiated by the recitation of Vedic texts as prayers, but that which men in their folly commit intentionally is expiated by prayascitta.

Manu II. 85-87 (which are the same as Vas, 26. 9-11 and Visnu Dh. S. 55. 10-21) lay108 down: 'the performance of japa is ten times more efficacious than the sacrifices (like Darsapūrna māsa) prescribed by the rules (of the Veda), japa when carried on inaudibly is a hundred times superior (to sacrifices) and mental revolution of mantras is a thousand times superior. The four pākayajñas 109 (Vaiśvadeva, bali, daily Śrūddha, and hono uring gueste) together with the Vedic sacrifices do not come up to even the 16th part of japa. A brāhmana attains perfection (the highest goal) by japa; he may or may not engage in other duties (such as Vedic sacrifices); a brāhmaṇa befriends all creatures'. Great eulogy is bestowed on the inaudible japa of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III, 62,10) for which pp. 303-305 of H. of Dh, vol. II may be consulted. Where no particular number is specially mentioned the recitation of a mantra is to be per formed a hundred times. 110

Manu1104 XI. 261-262, Vas. 27.1-3, Angiras 101 and other works go so far as to assert that the fire of Veda study con sumes guilt caused by evil deeds just as a fire burning strongly eonsumes even green trees or that a brahmana who remembers Rgveda (studied by him) is not tainted by any guilt, though he may have destroyed the three worlds and have eaten the food of any person whatever. But these are simply laudatory(arthavadas) and are not to be taken literally, as Vas, 27, 4 111 (=Angiras 102) gives the warning 'one should not become addicted to (or take pleasure in committing) evil deeds relying on the power of the Veda (stated in some smrti passages). The effects of) actions done through ignorance and negligence are alone consumed (by Veda study) and not those of other actions (intentionally done).'

Dh. S.56. 3-27, Atri VI.1-5 (which are almost the same as Vas 112 28. 10-15), Sankha, chap. 11 (=Vas. 28. 10-15), Samvarta 227 228, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 2. 4-5, IV. 3. 8, IV. 4. 2-5, Yāj. IJI. 302-305, prescribe several Vedic hymns or single Vedic verses or prose passages as specially efficacious for removing all sins. It is not possible nor necessary to set down all of them, but by way of sample the verses of Manu (XI. 249-257) are translated here. *Even a drinker of surā becomes pure if he mutters the hymn (seen) by Kutsa 113, the three verses beginning with 'prati" (Rg. VII 80. 1-3) seen by Vasistha, the Māhitra hymn (Rg. X. 185), the verses called Suddhavatis (Rg. VIII, 95.7-9 where the word

suddha' occurs 13 times in different connections). Even he who has stolen gold (of a brāhmana) instantly tecomes free from guilt if he once mutters (the hymn) beginning with 'asya vāmasya' i. e. Rg. I. 164. 1-52), and the Sivasankalpa (Vāj. S. XXXIV. 1-6). The violater of a guru's bed is freed from sin if he repeatedly recites the hymn beginning with 'havispāntam' (Rg. X. 88. 1-19 ) and the hymn beginning with 'na tam-amho (i. e. Rg. X. 126.1-8), the hymn beginning with 'iti' (i. e. Rg. X. 119) and the hymn addressed to Puruṣa (Rg. X. 90). He who desires to do away with sins, great and small, should mutter during a year the verse beginning with 'ava' (i. e. 'ava te helo varuna namobhih' Rg. I. 24. 14, Tai. S. I. 5. 11. 3), or the vərse ‘yat kim ca' (Rg. VII, 89. 5) or the verse 'iti vā' (Rg. X 119. 1). That man who, having accepted a gift that ought not to. be accepted, or having eatən forbidden food, mutters the hymn beginning with 'tarat sa mandi' (Rg. IX. 58.1-4)114 becomes pure after three days. He who has committed many sins becomes pure if he recites for a month the hymn beginning with 'Somā rudra' (Rg. VI. 74. 1-4) and the three verses beginning with

Aryamanam' (Rg. IV.2.4-6) while he bathes in a river (and not in a pond or other reservoir of water). One guilty of a grioyous offence should mutter the seven verses beginning with 'Indram' (Rg. I. 106. 1-7). A twice-born man removes even very great guilt by offering clarified butter for a year (in fire) with the mantras for the Sakalahomas (Vāj.S. VIII. 13) or by muttering the

mantra 'nama id-ugram' (Rg. VI. 51. 8). One who is stained by mortal sin becomes pure if with a concentrated mind he attends cows for a year, reciting the Pāvanāni hymns (the whole of Rg. IX) and subsisting on alms. 114a

So much importance and such occult powers came to be attached to the words of the Rgveda that the Rgvidhāna of Saunaka (which is later than Manu) concerns itself with prescribing numerous hymns of the Rgveda for the removal of various diseases, of sins, for the conquest of enemies.

The Sāma. Br. I. 5. 2 says 115 generally that when no parti cular hymns are prescribed for the removal of sins Vedic mantras are powerful and become purifiers if accompanied by tapas and the Sāmans may be repeated for the same purpose from ten times as the minimum to 100 times as prāyagcitta, Gautama 19. 13 prescribes the kind of food on which one should subsist when one is engaged in japa viz, one was to live on milk alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only, to live on barley gruel prepared from a handful of grain, to eat gold116, to eat clarified butter, and to drink soma and so forth. Gautama 19. 14 further lays down that all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (reis). cowpans and temples of the gods are places (which help to destroy sin).

As the Veda could be studied in and after the sutra period only by the male members of the first three classes, the japa of Vedic texts for the removal of sins was not possible for sūdras; therefore, the Mit. (on Yāj. III. 262) says that although the sūdra (and women and those born of pratiloma marriages also) has no adhikāra (power or capacity or authority) for the recitation of Gāyatri and other Vedic mantras, still the sūdra and women after revolving in the mind the name of the deity put in the dative case can engage in japa with the word namah (i. e. he can only utter the words 'namo namah' and not om &c)

When Manu IV. 80 says 'let him not explain to a sūdra the sacred law (dharma) nor imposé upon him a vrata' all that is meant is, according to the Mit. on Yāj.

IV. 20 says that those born in the inverse order are outside the pale of the sacred law, the meaning is that samskāras like upanayana are not to be performed on them. The mystic syllable 'om' is said by Ap. Dh. S. (I. 4. 13. 6) to be the door to heaven and was to be employed before the recitation of any Vedic passage. The Yogasūtra (I. 27) avers that om (called pranava) is expressive of the idea of God and that the repetition of om and revolving the meaning of it in the mind lead to concentration.118

Not only were certain Vedic hymns and passages recom mended for recitation with the object of removing sins some works, particularly the Purānas, proposed an easy way for all viz. that the remembrance of God Nārāyana (or Hari or Krsna) removed all sins. The Brahmapurāṇa (chap. 176) contains a stotra (hymn of praise) of Visnu, which when recited is said to free a man from all sins (mental, vocal or bodily). The Pr. V. p. 31 quotes a verse from the Bhavisyapuranal18a and three verses from the Viṣnupurāṇa as follows:even a great sin is removed by the resolve of) not doing it again, by gifts, by confessing it to others, and by meditation (on Visnu) and not only by prāyaścittas' (Bhavisya); 'of all the expiations (for sins declared by the sages) such as tapas (Candrāyana and others ) and other actions (japa, homa, gifts ) the meditation on

Taking the name of Hari Krsna is the highest. If a man remembers Nārāyana in the morning, at night, at twilight, at midday and the like, he at once secures the removal of sin' (Visnupurāṇa). The Brahma purāṇa119 (216. 87-88) gives expression to a popular belief as follows:"Men, even after committing sins many times through folly, do not go to Hell if they prostrate themselves before Hari who destroys all sins. Those men also who always remember Janārdana eyen by roguery go to the world of Visnu after death." The Visnupurāṇa affirms that those who contemplate upon the mantra of twelve letters (viz. 'om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya') do not return to the cycle of births and deaths. The great power of mantras is mentioned in the Adiparva (161. 14) by Kunti. The Nrsimha-purāṇa in chap.18 eulogises the mantra of eight letters (om namo Nārāyanāya) and chap. 63.6. states "what is the use of many mantras and the performance of many vratas, when the mantra 'om namo Nārāyanāya' is capable of securing all desired objects". The mantra of five letters 'namah Sivaya' is dealt with in Lingapurana (pūrvārdha, chap. 85) and Saura purāṇa 65. Brahma-purāṇa speaks of vaidika mantras and āgamolta mantras (41. 63). The Nityācāra-paddhati (p. 67) says that it is necessary to understand the meaning of Vedic mantras in srauta rites but in smārta rites it is not so.

Dāna (gifts). Gaut. XIX. 16 provides120 that gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter and food are the gifts (that destroy sin) and may be optionally undergone as penance if no express mention is made thereof. Vas, quotes several verses on gifts one of which (29. 16) states: "whatever sin a man distressed for livelihood commits he is purified from that by giving land even if it be as small in extent as 'gocarma' "121Visnu Dh. S. 92.4 is to the same effect. Sam varta122 (204) prescribes that the gifts of gold, cow and land

quickly destroy sins even if committed in former lives. Medha tithi (on Manu XI. 139) remarks that the verse implies that as to sins arising from injury to living beings gifts are the princi pal expiations. The subject of dāna has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 837-888. A few further remarks may be made here. In many inscriptions and copperplate grants of lands or villages the donor usually states that the grant is made for the increase of the merit of himself and of his parents (e. g. E. I. vol. XI, p. 219 at p. 221). Bphaspati123 as quoted in the Madanaratna (vyavahāra p. 66) expressly provides that in land-grants the king should state that he made the gift for securing merit to his parents and to himself124. The Rājatarangiṇi (I. 143 ) 125 refers to the founding of vihāras (monasteries).

Upavāsa (fasting ). Fasting strictly means total abstin ence from food and drink, but generally it means light diet restricted in quantity and also as regards the nature of the articles taken. Even the Tai. S. (I. 6. 7. 3-4) refers126 to three ways of observing vrata on the days of the Darsapūrnamāsa-iṣti either by subsisting only on food available in the village or on forest food or partaking of no food at all. Gaut. 19.11 includes upavāsa among the several means of removing sins. Tapas is also one of such means acc. to him. But in Gaut, 19.15 as stat ed above, Gaut, includes fasting (anāśaka) among 'tapāmsi'.

124. In Europe the same practice prevailed in the middle ages, "The founder of monasteries) constantly tells us that this sacrifice is made for the atonement of his own sins and those of his progenitors and kinsfolk" G. G. Coulton in 'Five centuries of Religion (1936) vol. III. p. 27. Redemption of sin by monetary payments or by leaving property to the churches and monasteries was a very firm belief in the Middle Ages in Christian countries, so much so that men who had earned properties made large gifts to the church when the prospect of death was near and vast estates accumulated in the hands of churchmen, which led to the passing of the Statute of Mortmain in England,

Upavāsa ( fasting)

Haradatta explains upavāsa187 as giving up the eating of boiled rice (bhaktatyāga) and adds that upavāsa is again included under tapāmsi to show the great importance attached to it. Haradatta notes that a predecessor of his relying on a Purāna passage explained u pavāsa in Gaut. 19.11 as 'restraint of senses'. In many of the Grhya sūtras upavāsa means only eating light food prepared from corn usable in sacrifices (such as rice) once in the day excluding vegetables, māṣa (pulse), salt and flesh (compare Gobhila gr. I. 5.26, Khādira gr. II. 1.4 and 6, Kausika sūtra I. 31-32, Kathakagrhya 46.2128). The Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 closely associates 'anāśaka' (fasting) with tapas as a means to the mystic realisation of the Supreme Soul129 Jaimini (III. 8. 9 11) appears to regard fasting as tapas130. Manu XI, 203 (=Visnu Dh. S. 54.29) provides that fasting (for a day) is the penance for omitting the rites ordained by the Veda (such as the Darśapūrṇamāsa sacrifice and the performance of sandhya adoration) and for neglecting the special duties of a snātaka (laid down in Manu IV. 34 ff). When a person was observing a fast he had to avoid doing certain other actions. Acc. to Devala a fast becomes bereft of its good results by drinking water often, by chewing tâmbulat'by sleep in the day-time and by sexual intercourse131 ; but the Garudapurāṇa I. 128.6 and Bhavisya purana (I. 184.27) allow even when one is fasting the use of flowers, ornaments, rich clothes, garlands, unguents, applying collyrium to the eye and the cleansing of teeth. Daksa quoted by the Par. M. states that if a man observes a fast for the day and night on the day on which the sun first turns towards the

north or south, or on the Vișuva day (day of equinox), and on an eclipse of the sun or the moon and bathes he is freed from all sins132. Manu XI. 166 (=Agnipurāṇa 169.31) prescribes a fast for three days as a penance for theft of grass, firewood, tree, dry food (i. e. grains of rice), jaggery, clothes, hide and flesh, The Anuśāsanaparva (106.1) remarks133 that men of all varnas and even Mlecchas thought highly of fasts and that chapter contains an exaggerated eulogy of fasting. Almost all religions (except Zoroastrianism) such as the Hebrew, Christian (in Lent) and Moslem (in Ramjan) emphasize the necessity of fasting as a discipline or as a preparation for penitence. The Bhavisya purāṇa (I., chap. 16. 12-14) states that those who have not kind led sacred fires can please the gods by vratas, restraints, gifts and particularly by upavāsas and points out (verses 18-22) what substances (eatables) should be given up from the first to the 15th tithi in each fortnight. In the Satapatha Brāhmana and the srauta and grhya sūtras the word upavasatha is used in the sense of 'upavasa' and is derived from 'vas' (to dwell) with 'upa'. Vide. H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1010 and n. 2276 for the Sat. Br. The Khadira gr II. 1.4, Gobhila, gr. I. 6.2, Kausika-sutra I. 31 employ the word upavasatha. Āp. Dh. S. II.1.1.4-5. prescribe an upavāsa for husband and wife on parvan days and if they cannot totally abstain from food they should eat only once by day food proper for upavāsa. Aparārka p. 199, Smr. C. (srāddha p.355) and Krtya ratnākara quote a verse from Vyāsa deriving the word upavāsa13a The Ap. Dh. S. II, 5. 9-13, Baud. Dh. II, 7.32, Vas. 6.21 and San. gr. II. 16.5 have the same verse viz. 'an āhitāgni, a draught ox and brahmacãrin, these three fulfill (their work) by eating; they cannot fulfill their duties by non-eating'. This is explained as not applying to prāyaścittas (Baud. Dh. S II, 7.34) and to fasts on Ekādaśī, The Santiparva 323.17 states "Just as a dirty garment is afterwards cleansed by water, so to those who are heated in the fire of) fasting inexhaustible happiness for a long time comes.' Santi 79.18, however, says 'merely emaciat ing the body by fasting is not tapas, but ahimsā, truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, restraint and compassion are tapas'.

Tirthayatra (Pilgrimages)

55

Tirthayātrā: Pilgrimage will be dealt with exhaus tively in a later section. It was believed that going on a pilgrimage and bathing in such holy rivers as the Ganges freed a man from sins. Viṣnu Dh. S. (35.6) lays down that those guilty of mahāpātakas may become pure by Aśvamedha sacrifice or by visiting all the sacred places on the earth. Devala says that a man removes the consequences of such grave sing as the murder of a brāhmana that he may have committed uninten tionally by the performance of great sacrifices or by going on a pilgrimage. Parāśara (XII, 58 ff) prescribes 134 pilgrimage to see Rāma's bridge to Lankā for a murderer of a brāhmana who has studied the four Vedas. Devala states: 'a man becomes freed from sin by approaching holy places and shrines, brāhma nas that practise austerities, that all rivers that fall into the ocean, all great mountains, all shrines and all forests are holy.' The Matsyapurāṇa (184.18) says that a heap of sins as big as the mountain Meru or Mandara becomes destroyed when man reaches Avimukta (Benares). The Kurmapurana135 (pūrvārdha 29.3) says: 'I do not see any other expiation for destroying all sins in the Kaliyuga for all beings except Benares'. Even in the times of the Peshwas of Poona pilgrimage was prescribed for brāhmaṇa murder (vide 'Selections from Peshwa Records, vol. 43 p. 107) and the brāhmapas were ordered that after the sinner performed the penance they were to dine with him and recognize that he had been purified. In an order dated sake 1659 (1737 AD) the Peshwa Bajirao the first informs the Deshmukhas, Deshpandes and Mukadams that four brothers named Zende approached him with the story that their father was born when their paternal grandmother lived with one Pilaji Zende after she became a widow and that she intended to remarry that man but that had to be postponed owing to famine, that the caste meeting were prepared to take them into the

Then the Peshwa issued an order that they should go to Tulapur on the banks of the Bhimā river and that they and their male progeny together with their wives should be restored back to the caste and complete association with them as to taking food and marriage be carried on with them from generation to genera tion,136 The Pr. Prakāśa quotes a verse from the Bhavisya purāṇa about the penance for brāhmana murder to the effect that for him who dwells to the north of the Vindhya mountain Parāśara prescribes the sight of Setubandha as a penance and then remarks that a man from the north of Vindhya has to travel 360 yojanas to reach Setubandha and that since 360 Prājāpatya penances are declared to be enough to remove the sin of brahmahatyā, it impliedly follows that each yojana towards a tirtha is equal to one Prājāpatya, The Smrtyar thasāra (pp. 149-150 ) quotes several verses from the Puranas stating that gods like Brahmā, Visnu and Siva, great sages like Bhrgu, Vasistha and Viśvāmitra, great kings like Hariscandra, Nala, Sagara obtained greatness by means of tirthas and that Pāndavas, Sri Krsna, Nārada, Vyāsa and other sages engaged in pilgrimages for securing kingdoms and for removal of evil fortune. This subject of tirthas will be dealt with at length in a separate section.
