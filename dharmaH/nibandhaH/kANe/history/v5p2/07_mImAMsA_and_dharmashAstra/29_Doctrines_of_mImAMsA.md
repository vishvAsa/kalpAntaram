CHAPTER XXIX 

Some Fundamental Doctrines of Purvamimāmsā 

Some of the characteristic fundamental doctrines of the Pūrvamimāṁsā will now be set out with some references and a few renarks as to some of them, the views of Prabhakara and his followers being also rarely referred to 

(1) Veda is eternal, self-existent, not composed by any author, human or divine, and is infallible. This is the core of the P, M, system. Vide P. M. S. 1. 1. 27-32 and Sabara on 1, 1. 5 (p. 53) and ślokavārtika (Vākyādhikarana, verges 1953 366 368). The argument briefly is; Veda is learnt at present and . was studied in tbe past also by students from teachers, that there is no evidence about the person who first composed it or who first studied it. If it be argued that such a reasoning may be put forward as regards the Mahabharata, the reply is that people know that Vyāsa is the author of it. Similarly, the passages in Smrtis and Purāṇas that Prajapati created the Veda are merely artharadas (laudatory ) not based on any evidence or perception and are meant only to convey the absolute autho ritativeness of the Veda. If the connection between word and . songe is eternal and not brought about by any person, the same reasoning holds good as to the Veda. This view is opposed to the view of the Naiyāyikas who hold that God is the author of the Voda or the interpretation of V. S. I. 1. 3 (Sastrayonitvāt) by Saṅkarācārya based on Br. Up. II, 4. 10. Manu I, 21 ( stating that Brahmā created from the words of the Voda the names and appropriate duties of all) seems to suggest that (according to

Manu) the Veda was self-existent. Similarly, the Mahābhāṣya on Vārtika 3 on Pāṇini IV. 3. 101 ("tena proktam') remarks 1954 that the Vedas were not composed by anyone, that they are eternal, that the meaning of the Veda is eternal, but the arrange ment of the letters is not eternal and therefore we have different vedic texts like Kāthaka, Kālāpaka, Paippalādaka &c. The Smṛtis also sometimes state that there is no author of the Veda, that Brahmā remembers it and that Manu also has remembrance of Dharma in different Kalpas (Parāśarasmrti I, 21). 

In P. M. S. I. 1. 28 (‘Anityadarsanāc-ca') the opponent of the eternality of the Veda puts forward such passages as 'Babara Prāvāhaṇi (son of Pravāhapa) desired' (Tai. 8. VII. 1. 10. 2) and 'Kusuruvinda Auddalaki desired' (Tai. S. VII. 2. %. 1), which mention men named Prāvāhani and Auddalaki (son of Uddālaka) that are mortals and argues that Veda did not exist before those mortals and is, therefore, not eternal. To this the Siddhānta replies in P. M. S. I. 1. 31 ('param tu śrutisāmānyam') that such examples are to be explained differently viz, 'Babara' is a onomatopoetic word meaning 'rustling' and Prāvāhaṛi (from 'pra' and 'vāhay' causal of lah) means the wind 

It may be noted that centuries before Jaimini and Yaska there was a school of Vedic interpreters called 'Aitibāsikas'. For example, Rg. X. 98.5 and 7 refer to Devāpi, son of Rṣtiṣena, and to Santanu. Yāska ( in Nirukta II. 10), starting with the words "tatra-itihāsamācakṣate' states that Devāpi and Santanu were brothers of the Kuru family and the younger brother Santanu wa8.crowned king ignoring the rights of the elder and that these verses refer to them. In Rg. X. 10 there is a dialogue between Yama and Yami and Nir. V. 2 refers to the 8th verse of it. Those who hold that Veda is eternal would explain Yama as Aditya and Yami as 'Night'. Rg. III. 33 is a dialogue between the sage Visvimitra and the rivers. The Nir. (II. 25–27) explains verses 5-6 and 10 of that hymn from the Aitihānika point of view and states that Viśvāmitra was son of king Kusika and does not mention the Nairukta interpretation of these verses.

The FTATATEE I. 3,30 Ton Ta ' also emphasizes the difference between 0 and irri.

(Seo. VII, Ch. XXIX 

About the Asvins the Nirukta (XII. 1) states several views viz. they are Heaven and Earth, or Day and Night, or the Sun and the Moon and remarks that according to the Aitihasikas they were kings who had accumulated great morit. Probably the Nairuktas were divided among themselves and explained that the Asvins represented different natural phenomena. About Vrtra ( occurring in such verses as Rg. I. 32. 11 ) the Nairuktas (Etymologists) said in Nirukta II. 16 that the word means 'cloud', while the Aitihasikas say that he (Vitra) was an Agura, son of Tyastr. As to the hymn Rg. 1, 105 of 19 verses (in the first 18 of which the refrain is vittam me asya rodasi') the Nirukta IV. 6 states that the hymn was seen by Trita who was thrown into a well In Rg. VII. 33. 11 there is mention of . Urvasi and Vasiṣtha (Maitrā.Varupa) as born of Urvasi and Nirukta (V.13-14) explains that verse and remarks that Urvasi was an apsaras and Rg. X. 95 is a dialogue between Aila Purū ravas and Urvash. But the interpretation of the Nairuktas and Aitihasikas on this story are not expressly set out. Probably the Nairuktas would explain Urvasi as lightning and Pururavas as the roaring wind. The hymn Rg. X. 108 is a dialogue between Sarama (Indra's bitch) and the Panis and the Nirukta XI, 25 explains the first verse and remarks that there is a story (Akhyāna) therein viz. that there was & dialogue between Saramā sent by Indra and the Paṇis who were Asuras. In all such legends the Nairuktas would insist that they are to be taken allegorically as referring to natural phenomena, while the Aitihāsikas would insist that there is historical basis in all these. Though it is not stated by the Ninukta expressly that the Aitibāsikas do not hold the doctrine of the eternality of the Veda it implicitly follows from their explanations that they did not subscribe to that doctrine. 

2. The connection between word and sense is eternal. 1955 This is explained by the words of Sabara (in n. 1953 ) that there is no person who could be put forward as baving brought about 

1955. The sūtra (P. M. S, I. 1. 5) contains several conclusions. The first is Si : (fara:) space sa fapt, the 2nd is a THEY (exbortation is the means of knowing it i, e, dbarma); bere ira means yua ita ( pronat. ilgrei verse 9); the next part is related set (it is dafailing or infallible as to all that is not perceptible); ATATTATHATT i e Vedic injunction is a valid means of knowledge since it is independent; T&TT40774 (this is the view of Badarāyaga also). The question what is a

the connection of word and sense. Vide P. M. 8. I. 1.6-23, Sabara's bhāṣya thereon, the elaborate treatment in 444 yerses in Ślokavārtika (pp. 728-8'5) and Prakarana-pañoikā pp. 133-140 (seventh Prakarana). On the question "what does a word like "Gauh' denote," the P. M. 8. replies that a word denotes 'aksti' (or jāti) i. e, the universal, the class. Briefly, the Mimārgakas hold that the word, the denotation and the relation of these two are eternal. Vide P. M, S, I. 3. 30-35. 

3. The individual soul. The P. M. 8. does not expressly affirm the existence of the soul in any sutra. Saṅkarācārya on V. S. III. 3. 53 refers to this fact, states that Sabara, the Bhāṣya kāra, propounded the existence of the soul and that the venerable Upavarga refrained from going into that question in his exposi tion of the Pārvamimamga with the remark that he would expound it when dealing with Sāriraka (i. e, the Vedanta-sūtra ). It was probably due to this fact of the absence of a statement about the soul that the Pūrvamimāṁsā was interpreted by some as favouring atheism, Kumārila complains that the Minārsā, though not really atheistic, was put forward as Lokāyata (atheistic) 1956 by some and that therefore he endeavours ( in the 

(Continued from last page) word' is answered differently by differeot writers. The revered Upavarsa said that in a word like 'gauh' it is the letters that constitute the word (vide Sabara quoting Upavarsa p. 45 on I. 1.5 and Śhaṅkara on V.S, 1. 3. 28). The other view is that the letters manifest the sphoṭa and it is the sphota that conveys the sense. This subject cannot be dealt with in this work. 

1956. Are ore pe fHRT la genteari ariantù a rengat मया॥ श्लोकवा. verse 10. The न्या. र. notes that भर्पमित्र put forward several wrong doctrines about the Mimāmsā such as the one that the performance of obligatory acts or of prohibited acts leads to do desirable or undesirable results. Vide H. of Dh, vol. III. pp. 46-47 note 57 and vol, II. pp. 358-359 on लोकायतिक and नास्तिक. The meaning of लोकायत bad changed from time to time. कौटिल्य (I.2) included लोकायत under आन्वीक्षिकी along with सांख्ययोग. aurora appears to have knows the word gefirga, his sūtra (IV. 2. CD) is 'क्रतुक्थादिसूत्रान्ताडक' and लोकायत is the 2nd word in the उक्थादिगण, the Kafka on this sūtra mentions are cre: ; at least before the 6th century A. D. orarefas had come to be identified with one who did not believe in the existence of a soul independent of the body. The area (paragraph 153) basterrafataqdardare:r. Farar on harm III. 3.54 says that the Lokāyatikas do not admit any principle other than the four elements ( earth, water, heat and wind) and do not believe in the existence of a soal apart from the body. Vide Prof. Das-gupta's 'Indian Philosophy' vol. III, P. 512-533 and 'Lokayata' by Dr. W. Ruben (Berlin 1954). From the Chān, Up. VIII, 8 it appears that Asura Virocana held that there was no soul

(Seo. VII, Ch. XXIX 

Ślokavārtika) to show that it treads the path of belief (in soul and another world). The souls are many, eternal, all-pervading (omnipresent) and different from the body, the senses and the mind. The soul resides in the body, is the agent ( karl) as well as blɔkir (enjoyer), is of the nature of puro consciousness, and is cognised by itself (svasamvedya). Though the P.M.S. does not expressly deal with the existence of the soul, there are indications that the P. M. S. itself must have impliedly accepted the existence of the soul. The reward of many religious rites is Svarga and the P. M. S. refers to numerous Vedic paysages where svarga is the reward of rites and assumes that the reward goes to the performer (e. g. in the adhiburana III, 7. 18-20 begin. ning with 'Sastraphalam prayoktari' that expounds the meaning of such vedic passages as 'agnihotram juhuyāt svargakāmak'). Sabara on I. 1. 5 expounds at great length the existence of the soul as different from the body, sepse3 &c. (vide particularly pp. - 60–72 of Ānan. ed.). The Slokavārtika devotos 148 verses to this subject and the Tantravārtika also briefly deals with it on P.M. S. II. 1.5 (pp. 402-403). The Slokavāritka (Atmavāda, Verse 148 ) has this interesting verse 1957 'the Bhāṣyakāra (Sabara) desirous of refuting atheism has established here (i. e, in bbāṣya passages) by reasoning the existence of the soul; the 

(Continued from last page) apart from the body and that the body alone was the soul. There is a recent book published (while these pages were being sent to the press) viz, 'Lokāyata' (study of ancient Indian materialism) written by Shri. Deva. prasad Chattopadhyaya (New Delbi, 1959), which deals with the subject of Indian materialism in detail,

As the words आत्मास्तिता and नास्तिक्य are put in juxtaposition in श्लोकवार्तिक it follows that, acc. to कुमारिल, नास्तिक is primarily one who does not believe in the existence of the soul. momia has the sūtra 'st नारित विष्टं मति:। IV. 4.60 0n which the महाभाग्य explains 'अस्तीस्यस्य मतिरास्तिकः। 

TENTAFE Argaltiin:', the Finant explains 'Trostatstila 4 HARPET \# i : aggirait aurtean', so armani primarily means 'one who does not believe in the existence of the soul (and as a consequence in a world other than the physical). The 77971. (pp. 402-404 on II. 1, 5 establishes the following propositions about the soul: तत्र निरयः सखात्मा शरीराभ्यन्तरवती (नाणुमात्रः, न शरीरपरिमितः), सर्वगतः, आत्मनानाले स्वदोषः, सर्वगतस्वास्सिनमारमनी FOI. 

Existence of the soul. 

1207 

knowledge on this subject (viz. existence of the soul) becomes sound and enduring by the study of Vedānta passages'. The Padma-purāṇa states that Jaimini composed a vast, but useless Śāstra by expounding the view of there being no god. 1957a 

4. God and the devatās in sacrifices. Sabara's position is that the Vedas were not created by God, nor was the connection between word and sense created by Him. The Prakararapancikā also (pp. 137 ff) denies & creator for the whole universe. Kumārila's position 1958 also is peculiar and startling. He says in the Slokavārtika that it is difficult to prove that God first created the world together with Dharma and Adharma and the means of attaining these, words, sepses, and their relations and the Veda. Thus it appears that he does not expressly deny the existence of a supreme power or God but simpily ignores such power or God. In spite of this he begins his Slokavārtika with an obeisance to Śiva. 1959 The Nyāyaratnākara says that the verse can also be an apotheosis of Yajña. But in that case Kumārila would have to be charged with duplicity. It is better to say that the tradition of beginning a work with a mangala verso could not be discarded even by Kumārila, 

The consideration of the question of what is meant by the deratā with reference to which an offering is cast into the sacred fire leads to startling results. Jaimini (in VII. 1. 32-34) takes the position that in a sacrifice the havis (offering) is the principal matter while the devatā is a subordinate ono (guna) and that if there be a conflict between the havis and the devatā, the final conclusion is to be arrived at by relying on the havis. The reasoning is that the Veda connects the deity with the sacrificial act, as in 'one desirous of progeny should offer an havis for Indra and Agni cooked on eleven potsherds and then Indra confers on him progeny' (Tai. S. II, 2. 1. 1.). Even though

(Soo, VII, Oh. XXIX 

it is so, the phala (the reward) is conferred by the sacrifice and not by the deities (Indra and Agni in this case) and the words 

Indra 190 and Agni confer progeny on the sacrificer' are purely laudatory. P. M. S. IX. 1. 6-10 are very important in this connection. Sabara quotes Vedic passages like Rg. X. 47.1, III. 30.5, VIII, 17. 8 (where Indra's right hand, fist, neck, stomach and arms are mentioned), Rg. I. 95 10, VIIL, 77, 4 (where Indra is said to have put in his stomach all foods and to have drunk thirty yessels full of soma), Rg. VIII. 32. 22 and X 89.10 where Indra is said to be lord of the world, of heaven and earth, waters and nountains and then remarks that these are all artharūdas, though at first sight they appear to postulate that Vedic deities have bodies, eat and drink. The Sastradipika advances the argument that if the devatā had a body, ate, drank and was pleased, devata will be anitya (ephemeral) and could not in that case be treated of in the Veda that is eternal. He further asserts that men of limited intelligence not knowing the real import of the Vedic passages may hold wrong opinions. Sabara notes (on X. 4. 23 ) that there are various opinions as to who the Dovatās are to whom either a hymn (sūkta) is addressed (as Rg. I. 94) or to whom 'havis' is directed by the Veda to be offered as in' one should offer to Agni an offering cooked on eight potsherds'; that the devatā becomes connected with the sacrifice not in its own nature but by the word used with reference to an offering and that where the Veda directs an offering to be made to Agni, one cannot use a synonym for Agni such as 'Suci, Pāvaka, Dhumaketu, Krśanu, Vaisvānara or Sāpdilya. Thus Devatā is a matter of words, as admitted by 141

Śabara. The Prakaranapancikā also states that there is no proof that a sacrifice (vāga) is a means of pleasing the deity and that to say that there is worship of a deity in a yāga is really metaphorical. From this and the proceding doctrine (No. 1) it follows that P. M. 8., Sabara, and Kumārila discard the idea that the Veda is the word of God or that rewards of religious acts are due to the favour or grace of God. It is therefore that the Padmapurāṇa quoted (in note 1957a) above dubs Jaimini's doctrine 'girīśvaravāda' (Godless). 

When the Veda says one desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice', three ākāṇkṣās (expectancies) arise. The first is 

what is to be brought about'; this is satisfied by the word svarga, stating the reward or the purpose. The 2nd is 'by what means' is the first to be brought about. That is satisfied by the meaning of the root 'yaj' (i, e. by yāga); the third is 'what is the procedure or in what manner'; that is satisfied by the eata blishment of the sacred firus and other rites that are described in the context of the passage 'svargakāmo yajeta'. It is learnt from this passage that the reward or purpose (svarga) springs from ( is brought about by) yāga and not by the dovatā. 192 

Later writers could not digest all these ideas about the deities in sacrifices. Venkatanātha (or Venkatadeśika, 1269– 1369 A. D.) composed a work called 'Seśvaramimārsa', in which he oriticizes both Bhatta and Prābhākara schools and being an ardent Vaiṣṇava of the Ramānuja school attempts & synthesis of the two mimāmgās and brings in the idea of God as the dispenser of the reward of sacrifices against the combined testimony of Sabara, Kumārila, Salikanātha and others. Vide Dr. Radha krisnan in Indian Philosophy,' vol. II pp. 424-429 for 'God and world according to Pūryanimāṁsā', 

5. There is no real creation nor dissolution of the whole universe. The constituent parts may come and go but the universe as a whole has no beginning and no end. The descrip tions of creation and dissolution are only meant to illustrate the power of daita (fate, destiny) and the vanity of human effort and urge men to perform duties enjoined by the Veda. Without any human effort the world may come into being and in spite of

all effort it may come to an end. The world is real and has always been there and will go on for all time. 1963 Vide Slokavārtika (V. 112-117), Prakaranapancikā pp. 137-140 and Nyayaratna kara on the former. The Slokavāratika goes so far as to say it must be admitted that all these ( worlds &c.) existed before the creator, and again such a creator may be proved (by anumāna) to have been preceded by the Voda on account of his being an intelligent being, just as ourselves are praceded by the Veda.' 

It would be noticed that the Mimāınsa idea of creation and dissolution is opposed to the Mahabharata and Gita (X. 8 

aham sarvasya prabbaro mattaḥ sarvam pravartate). 

6. The doctrine of upūria (invisible mysterious or subtle potency). The Veda lays down that one desirous of heaven should perform a sacrifice. But the reward heaven comes off only after a long time, while the sacrifice lasts only for a short time. There would thus be no direct connection between the sacrifice (the cause ) and heaven ( the reward) or purpose. It must be presumed from the Vedic injunction that there is some connecting link between the activity of man to perform a yāga and the reward. Before the principal and subordinate acta in a sacrifice are performed men have no capacity for svarga and sacrifices (described in the texta) are also incapable of producing the effect 'svarga'. The principal and subsidiary sots in a sacri. fice when carried out remove the incapacity and produce & certain capacity or potency for svarga. This must be admitted by all. Unless such a capacity exists there would be the unac ceptable conclusion that not doing the acts and doing them are on the same level. This capacity or potency either rosiding in the man (agent) or arising from the sacrifice that is performed is called apūrvu in this sāstra. It is true that this capacity cannot be proved by direct perception or other means of know ledge except by śrutārthāpatis. When we are told that a man

Similarly, the Veda brings sacrifice and svarga together; we have to presume that sacrifice gives rise to a subtle potency, though the sacrifice itself comes to an end in a short time, and that this potency is the cause of bringing about the reward svarga and that we may look upon it as abiding in the soul of the sacrificer or as an : invisible effect (a reaching forth of the yāga itself that has vanished ). 1961 Mimāmsakas do not admit that the results of religious acts are given by God. The V. S. III 2. 40 states that this is the view of Jaimini (dharmam Jaiminir-ata eva) and is opposed to the view of Bādarayana, Śhaṅkara and the Bbāmati that it is God who confers the reward. According to the Prakaranapanoikā (p. 186 ) the invisible force or potency is not in the agent but arises as a subtle form from the action itself. Four kinds of Apūrvalos (with further sub-divisions) as regards Darśapūrṇamāsa sacrifice are stated by Madhavācārya. 

The idea is that every rite as a whole produces an apūrva, and that each subordinate part (anga) of the rite has also an (apūrva) which is subordinate to the apūrva of the whole rite. 

The Tantravārtika explains why it is called apūrva. The invisible potency was not in existence before the performance of

the sacrifice and arises 8s something new after its performance and hence apūrva has a purely etymological sepgo. 1966 

If one holds the view that apūrva is some potency coming to reside in the performer of a sacrifice one's views would be like those of some modern writers who hold that real prayer is not mere repetition of certain words deemed to be sacred, but it is an upward movement or a real increase in the intensity of spiritual power in the man who prays, it being immaterial to ask to whom he prays (vide W. James' Varieties of religious experience' p. 467 ). 

7. Svatah-prūmānya (self-Falidity of cognition). It has already been stated that the pramūnas are six (five according to Prabhākara). The P. M. system postulates that all cognitions as cognitions are intrinsically valid in themselves, do not require any extraneous help to establish their validity but in validity of cognitions is (parath) established extraneously by showing that there was defect in the organ that produced the cognition or it is established later on that a particular cognition was wrong. 1967 Prabhākara goes much further and holds that every experience as such is valid and no experience can be said to be wrong or illusory.

165-167 and 168-171 for descriptions of the joys of heaven in the Vedic literature, the Epic and the Purāṇas. From considera tions of space the remarks will have to be brief. In Rg. IX, 113, 7-11 the sage prays to Soma to place him in that immortal world where there is continuous light, where all desires are fulfilled, where there are joys of various grades. Heaven was deemed to be the place where the souls of valiant men that fought battles and sacrificed their lives wont (Rg. VI. 46. 12) and in Rg. X 154. 2-4 the soul of the dead is asked to join those departed men that had become invincible by great tapas, that had died in battle, that had made gifts of a thousand cows, that had led a life of right and virtue and that were wise sages. 

The Atharvaveda IV. 34.2 and 5-6 say that in heaven there are many women, they got edible plants and flowers of various kinds, there are streams of ghee, honey and wine ( sura), milk, curds and there are lotus ponds all round. The Satapatha Br. (XIV. 7. 1. 32–33) states that the joys of heaven are 100 times greater than those on earth. Vide Macdonnell's 'Vedic Mythology' pp. 167-168 and A. B. Keith's 'Religion and philo sophy of the Veda'sto. pp. 403-406 (1924). Even the Upaniṣads refer to the joys of heaven e. g. Chan. VIII. 5. 3. speaks of two lakes in the world of Brahmā, aśvattha tree showering down Soma and the city of Bṛahmā calld Aparājitā; the Kausitaki Up. (I. 3 and 4) elaborates this and adds that five hundred Apsarases go out to meet him (who reaches heaven), one hundred with garlands in their hands, one hundred with ointments, one hundred with perfumes, one hundred with garments and one hundred with fruits. Poets like Kālidāsa love to dwell upon the instantaneous arrival of the soul of the warrior whose head was cut off in battle and who was at once joined by an apsaras in heaven (vide Raghuvamsa VII. 51 'Vāmāógasamsaktasuran gunaḥ svam prtyat-kabandham samare dadarś&'). The Purāṇas furnish graphic descriptions of the joys of heaven. Vide Brahma purāṇa 225. 6, Padma II. 95. 2-5, Mārkandeya 10. 93-95, which enumerate Nandana garden, aerial cars with bevies of Apsarases, golden beds and seats, absence of sorrows, all pleasure &c. Sabara on P. M. S. VI. 1. 1 refers to two popular views about svarga; one is, whatever gives pleasure to a person such as silken garments of fine texture, sandalwood, damsels sixteen years old is designated starga. Another popular view is that svarga is a certain place where there is no heat nor cold, no hunger nor thirst, no dissatisfaction, no tiredness.

1 Sec. VII, Oh. XXIX 

Sabara and Kumārila say that popular 1968 ideas about svarga are invalid, that the Mahabharata and Purīgas, being composed by men, need not be considered and that the Vedic descriptions of svarga are more arthavādas for praise, 

___P. M. S. IV. 3. 15. provides that svarga 199 is the reward of all religious acts (such as Viśvajit) for which no express reward is provided by the texts. Sabara states 'happiness is svarga and all seek that'; an old verze says 'that state of happiness in which there is no mixing of pain, which is not immediately overwhelmed by pain, that comes to one when one desires it, is called by the word srar (svarga)'. 

Medhātithi remarks that smitis sometimes state 1970 that the gift of a single cow yields all rewards and relieves from sins with the result that fruits of great religious acts and of slight ones would be deemed to be the same but it should be under stood that the rewards diffor in their duration; otherwise, no one would engage in great or difficult rites. 

Some Vedic rites expressly declare fruits of sacrifices that are other than svarga. For example, the Tai, 8. provides one desirous of (plenty of) cattle should offer the catrd sacrifice' (II. 4.6. 1.) or one desirous of (leadership or control over ) a village should offer the Isti called Sangrahant' (Tal. S. II. 3. 9.2.).

Idea of svarga 

1215 

Sabara says the Veda does not say that the result of such sacrifices cannot be had in this very life. This the Tupṭikā. 19 expands in an interesting note. The remedy declared by the Veda for securing desired objects (son's birth and the like) is bound to yield the result in this life or in the next. If a man has committed evil deeds in a previous life he has to undergo the effects of those sing and while he is undergoing the effects of sins the fruits of sacrifices are postponed. But if the effects of sins have been extremely reduced be secures the fruits of kāmya rites in this very life. The words of the Veda laying down an injunction state only so much that the fruit of the rite performed does come about but they do not say that the fruit follows immediately ( after the rite is performed). Therefore, there is no definiteness (about the time when the fruit will follow). But svarga is to be enjoyed only in another life (as a fruit of rites performed in this life). It (avarga) means unequalled happin488 and is achieved in a degree proportionate to the actions; but it cannot be enjoyed in this life, since men experience in this world every moment both happiness and misery. Every happiness is not the fruit of Jyotiṣtoma and every being does not perform Jyotistoma. But some happiness does come to a man. Therefore, it (happiness ) is natural. The existence, however, of another body has to be imagined for the experience of unequalled happi ness, there being no other reasonable explanation. That unequalled happiness does not come to a man unless he dies; therefore svarga is to be enjoyed in another life. 

9. Mokṣa (liberation): Neither the P. M. S. nor Sabara nor Prabhākara deals with the topic of Mokṣa. Kumārila and

It should be noticed that a distintion is drawn here between priti ( a momont of happiness) and niratiśaya-priti, The EcoT on VI, 1, 1 says that the siddbānta view is that svarga means 'priti (happiness), while the pūrva pakpa holds that svarga signifies the means for things that cause happiness, but both do not hold that svarga is some place 'एकस्य भीतिः स्वर्गशब्दवाच्या, अपरस्य भीतिमद् अयम् । विशिष्टो देश उभयोरण्यवाग्य:' हुपीका on पू. मी. ए. VI. 1. 1 p. 1348.

Prakaranapancikā deal with it. They both say that liberation consists in not having to assume a body again. 1972 The śloka vārtika states 'one desiring Mokṣa should not do any aot that is forbidden or is Kumya (proscribed for those who desire an object like riches, son &c); he should perform obligatory rites (euch as agnihotra) and naimittika (like bath, japa and gifts on eclipse &c.) in order to avoid the sin that would accrue owing to non performance of those two; if he does not desire the rewards of doing pitya and naimittika acts they will not come to him, as such a reward comes to him who seeks it. The results of aots in a former life would be eliminated by undergoing them in the life in which he seeks liberation. This differs from Saṅkarācārya's position who holds on V. S. IV. 3. 14 that, as declared in the Svet. Up. III. 8, there is no other way to Moksa except knowledge and realization of the Ātman. In bis bhāsys on the same sūtra he seems to attack 1973 Kumarila's position. According to Kumārila Upaniṣad passages about the knowledge of the Atman are only arthavādas as thoy convey to the performer the knowledge that he has a soul and that the soul has certain characteristics, while Śhaṅkara maintains (on V. S. I. 1. 1) that the phala, the subject of investigation and the Vedic exhortation (codanā) are different in Pūrvamināmsā and in Brahamaml māmsā. There exist smrtis that ridiculed the idea that the mere

Doctrines of early R. M, writers are startling 

1217 

knowledge of the Self would lead to Mokṣa. For example, 1974 the Br. Y. Y. affirms that both knowledge and actions lead to Liberation, that to say that knowledge alone leads to liberation is a sign of indolence, that out of the fear of bodily labour ignorant men do not want to engage in actions. 

The doctrines of the early and principal writers on Pūrya mimāṁsā are rather quaint and startling. Their arguments about the eternality and self-existence of the Veda are fallacious and were not accepted even by other ancient Indian systems. Both Prabhākara and Kumārila have in their scheme no place for God as the dispenser of rewards or as the ruler of man's destiny, as being pleased with men's prayers. They do not expressly deny the existence of God, but they assign to God or the deities mentioned in the Vedic texts a secondary role or rather practi cally no role at all. They raise yajia to the position of God and their dogmas about yajña seem to be based upon a sort of commercial or business-like system, 1975 viz, one should do so many acts, dispense gifts to priests, offer certain offerings, observe certain ethical rules and other rules of conduct (such as not eating flesh, su bsisting on milk ) 1976 and then the reward would follow without the intervention of God. There is hardly any appeal to religious emotions, there is no omniscient Boing, no Creator and no creation of the world. The Pūrvam māmsā no doubt lays emphasis on the rights and) duties of man in life. The other darśanas are far more concerned with the ques tion of escaping permanently from the world and with man's destiny after death. The P.M.S, Sabara and Kumārila, how ever, make substantial contributions to the exegesis of Vedic

texts. There are about three thousand quotations in Sabara's bhāsya, out of which several hundred have not been yet identified. At least one thousand of these are taken from the Tai. S. and Br. About twelve adhikarapas are concerned with the Adhri. gupraiṣa (a long formula) wbich is quoted in H. of Dh, vol. II. p. 1121 note 2504. Some adhikarapas are devoted to the explana tion of certain words in that praisa e. g. PMS IX, 4. 22 explains urūka as 'vapā', IX. 4. 23-24 explain 'praśasā', IX. 4, 25-27 explain five words (syena, śalā, kaśyapa, kavaṣa, srekaparna). Similarly, X. 1.32 explains the word bṛsuya as meaning 'bphat.' Sabara's and Kumārila's stands on the individual soul and moksa confer on the P. M. system soine status as & philoso phical one. For a systematic and exhaustive study of Sabara's contribution to Vedic and post-vedic exegesis, vide Dr. S. V. Garge's citations in Sābara-bhāsya' pp. 140-213 (Poona, 1952). 

The doctrine that the Veda is eternal and of absolute and unquestioned authority has led to certain undesirable tendencies. Propounders of new doctrines make great efforts to show that there is Vedic authority for what they hold. For example, the gutras in V. S. I. 1. 5-18 are concerned to show that the Upaniṣads do not postulate Pradhana as the cause of the world, as the Sāṅkhyas imagine. Saṅkarācārya expressly states that the Saṅkhyas explain Vedānta passages as favourable to their theories and therefore a refutation of their arguments was 1977 provided in V, 8. I. 1. 5-18. It has been shown above how followers of Sākta worship try to interpret a verse like Rgveda V, 47. 4 (catvāra Im bibhrati &c) as referring to the Sakta doctrines and how treatisos dignified with the title of Upaniṣads were produced by sākta writers such as the Bhāvanopaniṣad. Sabara in his bhāṣya on PMS. 1. 1. 5 states that the Vijñānavādi Bauddhas put forward Bṭ. Up. IV. 5. 13 (Vijñānaghana evaitebhyo bhūtebbyaḥ samutthāya tānyevānuvinaśyati na pretya sanjñāsti) as supporting their position. One of the most glaring examples of this tendency is the explanation of Rg. L. 141. 1-3 by Anandatirtha, also called Madhyācārya, who in 'Mahābhārata-tātparya-nirṇaya' claims to be the third incarna tion of Vayu, the other two being Hanūmat and Bhimasena, one

I do not know how Madhvācārya would have met the charge of Veda not being eternal if it referred to Bhimasena (who oven' according to the traditional account in the Mahābhārata lived at the end of Dvāpara age i. e. about 5000 years ago) and to Madhva himself who lived barely seven centuries ago. The Veda would be later than those dates. The argument that this refers to a previous Kalpa would not be available to rebut the charge, as the Kalpa, Manvantara and Mahāyuga when Bhima and Madhvācārya flourished and in the present day are the same. There was no pralaya (dissolution of the world) at the end of Dvāpara and Kaliyuga immediately set in. The Bhārata war was fought between Dvāpara and Kali (Ādiparva 2. 13) and Kaliyuga was about to start at the time of that war (vide Vanaparva 'etat kaliyugam nāmācirād-yad pravartate' and Salya 60. 25 (prāptam Kaliyugam viddhi)'. It is on account of this pretention that he was very roughly handled by eminent writers like Appayya-dikṣita who charges Madhya with citing fabrioated Vedic and other texts in support of his doctrines. Vide I.. A. vol. 62 at p. 189 where the writer, Shri Venkatasubbiah, sets out over thirty works mentioned by Madhya which he states occur nowhere else. M. M. Chinna swami, who has edited (Benares, 1941) Appayya's work in 60 Verses with the commentary of Appayya called Madhyamata vidhyamsana and notes of his own, sets out on p. 4 thirty-six unknown works and the sūtras where they are cited by Appayya.

(Soo, VII, Ch. XXIX 

It is remarkable that great acaryas like Śhaṅkara and Ramanuja never claimed in their own works that they wore the avatāras of some deity. It was left to their disciples to say so, if at all. 

Having established that Voda is eternal and self existent the Mimāınsakas give free rein to their ingenuity, powers of reason ing and logic. They have a logic of their own which governed not only the interpretation of Vedic passages but also of the Smartis and the medieval works on Dharmaśāstra (including law and procedure). As Colebrooke, one of the most accurate and level-headed of Western scholars of Sanskrit, said more than 130 years ago 'the disquisitions on the inimāinsā bear therefore a certain resemblance to juridical questions; and in fact, the Hindu law being blended with the religion of the people, the same modes of reasoning are applicable and are applied to the ono as to the other. The logic of the Mimansa is the logic of the law; the rule of interpretation of civil and religious ordinances, Each case is examined and determined upon and from the cases decided the principles may be collected. A well-ordered arrange ment of them would constitute the philosophy of law and this is in truth what has been attempted in the Mimadga' (Miscella. neous Essays, Vol. I. pp. 316-317, Madras ed, of 1837). 

The first division of Vedic material is into Mantra and Brāhmana. It has been already stated above (p. 1096 note 1776) that those are mantras that are recognized as such by the learned. P. M. 8. (II. 1. 31-32) provides 1979 that mantra is that which simply asserts (and is not hortatory ) or (to say the same thing in another way) 'those are mantras that are so called on account of their asserting something's On P. M. S. I 4. 1 Sabara describes mantra as one that at the time when the procedure of & sacrifice is being followed, recalls or reminds or makes clear to the performer the matter that is prescribed 0.g. 'I cut (the blades of) kusa grass that is an abode for the deity'. This is only a general description of mantra and not an accurate defini tion. Mantras are not supposed to be useful in sacrifices by

their more utterance (uccārana) but are really abhidhayaka' (reminders of what is to be done or is being done). Sabara remarks that laksana is the only way for the recognition of mantras and not an enumeration of some characteristics of mantras as done by the Vittikāra such as these viz. 1980 some end in 'asi' (thou art) ortvā' as in Tai, S. 1. 1.1 'ise tvā', prayer or wish (as in 'āyurdhā asi' in Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 1), praise ('agnir mūrdha divaḥ' in Tai. 8. 1V.4.4). Sabara points out that 'asi' and 'tva' occur even in the middle of mantras, the other characteristics such as blessing and praise are found in Brāhma ṇas also. The M. B. P. remarks that there are (p. 66) ono hundred kinds of mantras aod that if we take into account the fourteen Vedic metres and their sub-varieties there would be 273 different varieties of ?k mantras alone (p. 67). There are cor tain texts regarded as mantras (e. g. Vasantāya kapiñjalan alabhate' Vāj. 8. 24. 20) which are not merely assertive but rather relate to the procedure of a yaga ( in the case of Vaj, 8.24, 20, of Aśvamedha). 

Mantras are classified under three heads viz. Rk, Saman and Yajus. These are defined in P. M. S. II, 1, 35-37; the name șk is applied to those 1981 mantras that are divided into feat, metrical pādas (often) based on the meaning. Sāman is the name applied to Vedic mantras that are sung. It has been established in P. M. S: VII. 2. 1-21 and IX. 2. 1-2 that the mantra 1982 texts are not called Saman but only the musio, that

giti is an action which manifests various tunes owing to the internal effort made by the singer and in order to bring about the musical effect the singer has to resort to modifications of the letters of the rk, to disjunction (of parts of it), to omission (of & letter), to repetition, to pauses, to 1983 stobha. In VII.2. 1-21 the PMS establishes that the words 'Rathantara-sāman', 'Bphat sāman' refer only to the music and not to the rk or basic text set to music. Yajus means those Vedic mantras that are neither 

k nor sūman. There is another word 'nigada' applied to certain mantras that are addressed to others as directions to do certain acts and are uttered loudly such as 'agaidagain vihara', 

proksapīrāsādaya, 'idhmābarhirupasādaya'. They are Yajus (i. e, in prose), the only difference being that they are loudly uttered (in order that the persons to whom they are addressed may bear them), while ordinary Yajus is uttered inaudibly. Vide P. M. S. II 1. 38-45 for discussion on Nigadas and Mai. 8. HII, 6.5 for 'uccair-pcā kriyata uccaiḥ sāmopāmśu yajuṣā'. 

Mantra and Brābmapa constitute the Veda, The P.M. S. 1984 states that all those parts of the Veda that are not or cannot be called Mantra constitute Brāhmaṇa. Sabara notes that the Vettikāra, in order to enable students to decide what texts are Brāhmaṇa texts, pointed out certain characteristics found in Brāhmaṇa texts such as abounding in the word 'iti' or 'ityāba (so it is said), anegdote, stating the reason for an injunction, etymology, condemnation, praise, doubt, injunction, instance where another did something of the game kind, what happened in

past ages, changing the meaning after considering the context.1985 Sabara also quotes two verses summarising under ten heads the characteristics of Brahmana texts, points out that all this is only illustrative and that the characteristics mentioned by the Vșttikāra sometimes occur in mantras also, such as 'iti' in Rg, X. 119. 1, "ityāha' in Rg. VII, 41, 2, 'akhyāyika' as in Rg. I. 116. 3, reason (hetu) in Rg. I. 2. 4. The Rgveda alone contains over ten thousand mantras. Hardly one-third of them are employed in all the Vedic rites. The rest are employed in japa. Besides, the other Vedas also have thousands of mantras, Therefore, no formal definition of mantra is attempted and all that is stated is that mantras are those which have been recognised as such by the 1986 learned. 

Brāhmaṇas are attached to each Veda, such as the Aitareya and Kausitaki Brāhmaṇas to the Rgveda, the Taittiriya to the Krsna Yajurveda, the Satapatha to the Sukla Yajurveda, the Tāṇdya to the Samaveda and Gopatha to the Yajurveda. The Brāhmaṇas contain the oldest known specimens of probe in Indo-European languages, though prose formulas (probably earlier in date than those in the Brāhmaṇas) are found in the Kṭsṇa and Sukla Yajurveda Samhitās. They are the primary source of information about sacrifices, ritual and priests. They contain numerous myths and legends put forward for illustrating ritual and sacrifices. They often mention contests between gods and asuras (titans) and abound in etymologies. Their contents can be divided into two broad classes, viz. injunctive (hortatory ) passages (vidhis) and explanatory (or laudatory) passages ( arthavādas). The scope and purpose of arthavadas will be explained later on. But one important point to be noted is that the Mimāṁsakas are strongly opposed to holding that any part of the Voda, even the smallest, is useless or meaningless. 

It is now time to see how the Mimāmsakas deal with the contents of the Voda. The extant Vedic literature is of

enormous extent and of greatly varied content, Once it is admitted that the Veda is self-existent and not the work of any author, bugan or divine, every sentence in it apparently becomes of infallible authority. The Veda being the only means of knowing Dharma, the Mimimsakas had to accept that whatever the Veda says was authoritative and binding on them, as Sabara 1987 admits. But many Vedic texts are apparently in conflict with each other and often are in conflict with ordinary experience. A fow striking instances may be given to show how difficulties arose. The Tai. S. V. 2.7 and Mai. S. state one ghould not pile the fire altar on (bare) earth, nor in the sky, nor in heaven'. 1988 No one can build a fire altar in the sky, nor in heaven, The Veda apparently prohibits something which is quite impossible and therefore this prohibition seems at first sight senseless. The Tai. Br. (III. 8. 10.5) states that by offering the Pūrṇāhuti the performer secures all desired objecte. If Pārṇāhuti yields all objects, then one need not perform any further rites of Agnihotra &c. Does the Veda mean this? The Veda contains stories and legends about individuals e. g. Tai, S. mentions Babara Prāvāhasi who desired to be an eloquent speaker and therefore performed & sacrifice called Pancarātra and secured his object. The Veda would then be later in time than this Babara and this would forfeit the claim of being eternal &o. Therefore, Sabara states that a story that never happened is described for the sake of praise. This may be an escape from a tight corner but the explanation does not redound

to the credit of the Veda which is here admitted to have manufactured a non-existent story for pushing up one of its injunctions; besides, if people come to know from what Sabara says that the story is false, people would not be induced to go in for performing that rite. A true story might encourage persons to follow the prescription of the Veda in this case. The Tantravartika (p. 125) on this explanation of Sabara tries to meet the objection raised here. Sometimes Veda is divided into three portions viz. Vidhi, Arthavada and Mantra, names of yāgas like udblid and visvajit being placed under vidhi. The Ślokavārtika refers to this threefold division in its last verse. 1989 Though the whole Veda is the only means of right knowledge about what Dharma is i. e. what should be done and what should not be done, the different parts of the Veda are not all directly related to right knowledge about Dharma. Large portions of the Veda are related only mediately to the principal part. 1990 In one place Sabara very succintly but clearly defines the three classes of Vedic texts and illustrates them. The Veda is also divided into five parts viz. vidhi, arthavada, mantra, namadheya and prati ṣedha. These five have already been mentioned above. Here some details will have to be added on each of these. Vidhi is an injunction (or exhortation) that is meaningful on account of enjoining a matter that has & (useful) purpose and it prescribes

On the पूर्वपक्षमत्र 'उक्त समाम्नायैदमध्य तस्मात् सर्व तदर्थ स्थात्' (पू. मी. छ. I. 4.1.) शबर states 'कश्चिदस्य (वेदस्य) भागो विधियोऽविदितमर्थ वेदयति यथा सोमेन बजेतेति । कश्चिदर्थवादो यः परोचयन विधि स्तोति यथा धायुर्व क्षेपिष्टा देवता इति। कश्चिन्मन्त्री यो विहितमथै प्रयोगकाले प्रकाशयति यथा बहिर्देवसदनं दामि-इत्येवमादिः। अयं अर्थ: यस्य सः इवमर्थः तस्य भावः ऐदमर्यम् । समाग्नाय means वेद, उक्कं refers to पू.मी. ए. 1.2.1 (आम्नायस्य क्रियार्थत्वात् &c).

That विधि means something not knowa before or from another source follows from the पूर्वपक्षच 1.2.19 विधियों स्थावर्षलात् &c. OnI. 4.4 (p. 333) शवर says 'अविदितवेदन च विधिरियुज्यते।, अज्ञातस्य हि ज्ञापन विधिः। शपर on x. 3. 20%; On I. 4.8 p. 339 'यज्ञातस्ततो विधिः, पदि ज्ञातस्ततोमुवाद:। ... नयाख्यातमन्तरेण कस्य पा नामशब्दार्थण्यापारो विधीयते, this last states that ordinarily a vidbi is laid down by a vorbal form or by a potontial passive participle (ending in य, तम्य, or अनीप).

something that does not follow (or is not established by) from any other authority. Sabara himself describes in many places what vidhi means. For example, the injunction 'one desirous of (attaining) Heaven should offer Agnihotra' prescribes (the per- . formance of) boma that does not follow from any other authority and that has a beneficial purpose, its meaning being 'by the Agni. hotra offering one should effect (the attainment of)svarga', Where. however, a rite is otherwise established, all that can be done is only to enjoin an accessory with regard to it. Thus in the sentonce 'one should offer an oblation with curds' the homa being already established by the words 'one should offer Agnihotra (if one desires heaven)' all that is enjoined is the offering of curds with regard to it, the meaning being 'by curds one should effect the oblation'. Vide Tup-tikā on P. M. S. VI. 3. 17 and M. N. P. p. 17 ( B.O. R. I ed.). 1991 

The collection of vidbis in the Vedic texts forms the core of the Veda and refers to many specific rites. The central olemont in a vidhi is the verb or verbal form, which will be analysed later on. The question is: how is one to recognize a vidhi, Sabara quotes a verse which those who know the propositions about the meanings of words and sentences declare traditionally, viz. in all the Vedas the fixed (or defipite ) sign of a vidhi is the words 'one shall do', 'it should be done', 'it ought to be done', 'it should be so', it ought to be so!. 192From this it follows that a vidhi is ordinarily couched in the optative form (called vidhi ling in Sanskrit), and that a verb in the present tense cannot ordinarily be taken 48 laying down a vidhi, 1993 But sometimes a vidhi may be inferred even from a text in which the verb is in the present tense. For example, there is a vedic text occurring in the Mahāpitryajña which states he should follow holding the

fuelstick below the handle of the ladle in the pitryajña, since the performer of rites for the gods holds the fuel-stick above the handle. 1991 This has been construed as a vidbi (exhortation) and not as & more arthayāda. Another example is that of Rātrisattras (Soma sacrifices occupying more than twelve days ). A passage in the context of Rātrisattras states those who perform rātrisattra attain stability (or fame), are endowed with brahma lustro and eat or possess food'. This looks like a mere praise (arthavāda) of the performance of rātrisattras, but really it is a vidhi about the reward of rātrisattra mentioned in the above passage and states an exception to the rule that svarga is the reward of a rite in which no reward is specified by the Vedic. texts. This is employed in the Mit. on Yaj. III, 226 which states that the sin committed through ignorance is removed by the performance of penances. Ordinarily, a sinful act is deemed to be destroyed by undergoing the penalty that God may inflict, but Yaj. states a special rule. Medhātithi on Manu V. 40 (stating that animals, birds and herbs dying by being offered in yajñas reach higher levels) says that this is merely an arthavada and no vidhi can be imagined from this by the maxim of Rātrisattra. 1995 Vide Par, M.

adhikūravidhi about one desirous of stability has been assumed from the passage about rātrisaftra. Raghupandana in Ekādi.. śitattva (p. 28) explains the sūtras (P. M. S. IV. 5. 17-19 ) and illustrates this nyaya. 

Following the Vedas, tbe Smṛtis also lay down numerous vidbis by means of verbal optative forms or participleg ending in ya, tavya &c.'. For example, vide Manu IV.25 'agnihotram ca jubuyat' and XI. 53 ('caritavyam-ato &c.') as instances of the two ways. From different points of view vidhi is classified in various ways. One classification is into four, Utpattividhi (originative injunction), Viniyogaridhit (applicatory), prayoga vidhi (performance), aithikūra-ridhi (oligibility ). Utpattividhi is one which shows in a general way the nature of the rite, as in agnihotram juhoti' (he offers the agnihotra oblation); an applicatory injunction is one which conveys the conpexion of a subsidiary matter with the main rite as in 'dadhnā juboti' (ne offers oblation with curds) and this is dealt with in the 3rd chapter of the P. M. S.; a prayogavidhi is an injunction that governs the order of parts in a rite and suggests non-delay or promptness in the performance, though often times it is implied rather than expressly stated. This is considered in the chapters IV and V of the P. M. S. An Adhikāravidhi (injunction of qualification or eligibility ) is one that points to the ownership of the fruit of an action as in 'svargakāmo yajeta' (he who desires to secure heaven should perform a yāga). 19% This is the subject of the 6th chapter of P.

Another and an important classification is apūrva-vidhi (injunction of something quite now and not otherwise establish ed as in 'gvargakāmo gajeta'), niyamavidbi (& restrictive injunction) as in 'he pounds the rice and parisankhyāvidhi (an injunction in form where two alternatives being simul taneously possible one is precluded). The Tantravārtika defines these three in a well-known verse. 1997 For & sacrifice a plot of land is required which may be quite flat or may have ups and downs. Here there are two alternatives only and both cannot be availed of at the same time (i. e, a man cannot perform a sacrifice at the same time on even as well as on uneven ground). Therefore, same dese yajeta' (one should offer a sacrifice on an even spot) is a niyama (it restricts the performance to flat land only) and excludes the use of uneven land for & sacrifice. 'Five five-nailed animals are to be eaten'. This is & parisankhyā. This sentence is not a vidhi, as eating flesh is already established by men's appetites. Nor is it a niyama, sinco one can eat the flesh of five-nailed animals as well as of other animals at the same time. It is a parisankhyā. I, e, it prohibits the eating of the flesh of animals other than of five five-nailed animals. In form the sentence is a vidhi (as it employs the word 'bhaksyāḥ' (which is optative or potential passive participle), but in substance it is a prohibition of eating the flesh of animals other than the five five-nailed ones.

Rice can be unhusked with the nails or by being pounded by the use of a mortar and pestle. Therefore 'vrihin avabanti' is a niyama, since it does not allow the use of Dails and puts the restriction of pounding. 

1230 History of Dharmatāstra (Soo, VII, Ch. XXIË word parisankhyā occurs in P. M. 8 X. 7. 4 and 7 and Sabara notes that it is liable to three faults. 1998 

Dharmasastra writers make frequent use of the doctrine of niyama and parisankhyā. Medhātithi on Manu III, 45 (tuka. lābhigāmi syat) has a long note on niyama and parisankhya, quotes the verse of Tantravārtika and explains the passage about five five-nailed animals. The Mit. also on Yaj. on I. 79 (tasmin yugmāsu sainviset 'the husband should approach the wife on every even night next to the 4th night up to the ¡16th after her monthly illness starts) and on I. 81 holds a lengthy discussion whether there is a vidbi or niyama or parisankhya. The Mit. defines the three in prose, cites examples and tells us that some thought that there was only a parisankhyā, while Bbāruci, Viśvarūpa, and others (including the Mit.) hold that there is a niyamavidhi only in I. 79 and 81. Ap. Dh. S. II, 1. 17 deals with the same subject as Yāj. I, 79 and 81 and Haradatta says it is a niyama, while others thought it was a parisankhyā: and that in any case it is not a pure vidhi. On Gautama V.2 Haradatta comments that the ācārya (i.e. Gautama) holds that there is a parisankhyā only (the sūtra is 'garvatra vā pratisiddhavarjam '). Compare Yaj. I. 81 (yathākāmi bhaved-vāpi &c.), on which the Mit. emphatically says that in both Gautama and Yāj. there is a restriotive rule (niyama). Gautama prescribes that a brāhmaṇa should eat at the houses of persons of the three higher classes that are commended for the performance of their duties and should receive gifts also from such persons. Haradatta treats these two rules as 1999 parisankhyāvidhis, Ap. Dh. 8. II. provides the rules of conduct for husband and wife after their marriage, the first being 'taking food two times (morning and evening). Haradatta takes it as a parisankhya, meaning that eating & third time is prohibited (but they may or may not eat twice in the day), while others take it as a niyama meaning they must eat twice in the day'.

Niyamavidhis are of three classes, viz. those concerned with pratinidhis ( substitutes), those about pratipatti (concluding aot or final disposal of certain materials employed in a sacrifice), and those that are concerned with matters other than the preceding two. The Tāpdya-brāhmaṇa says 2000 if one is not able to obtain the soma plant, one may extract juice from putikas'. Jai, III, 6. 40 and VI. 3. 13-17 deal with this matter and Jai. and Sabara prescribe that if no soma plant is available in a soma sacrifice, the sacrificer should substitute pūtikas for Soma and no other substance, even if the latter bo more similar to Soma, can be used. 2001 The word pratipatti is used in several sūtras by Jai; vide IV. %. 11, 15, 19, 22). The casting into water of all utensils and things smeared with some ( such as the drogs left after Soma is extracted, the stones, two wooden boards and the post of adumbara in the midst of the sadas) at the time of the final purificatory bath (avabhrtha) in Jyotiṣtoma is said to be pratipattikarma (P. M S. IV. 2. 22). This terminology is employed in Dharmaśāstra works. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that out of the three pindas (balls of boiled rice) that are offered to the three male ancestors of the performer of $rāddha the wife desirous of a son should eat the middle pinda (meant for the paternal grandfather) and Devala provides that the piṇdas may be given to a brāhmaṇa or may be eaten by & goat or a cow or cast into fire or water. 2003 (This is the pratipatti of the piṇdas according to Aparārka (on Yāj. I. 256 ) and the Sm. C. II p. 486. Vide H. of Dh, vol. IV pp. 480-481. The word pratipatti is opposed to arthakarma. For example, in Tai. 8. we read after the soma plant is bought, he gives the staff to the Maitrāvaruṇa priest'. Here the staff had been first given to the performer (Yajamāna) at the time of Dikṣa and then transferred to the Maitrāvarupa who has several uges for it, viz. he can walk with its help in darkness, may enter water, can prevent cows and snakes from coming near him and he can

support himself on it. So this is difforent from pratipatti, where the substance is finally disposed of and no further use is made of it. This is dealt with in P. M. S. IV, 2. 16-18. This (giving of the staff) is arthakarma as opposed to pratipatti-karma. This is mentioned in Tai, S. VI. I. 4.2 (krite some maitrāvaruṇāya dandam prayacchati &c.). Another example of pratipatti is the casting of the horn of the black antelope on the cūtvāla ( Tai. S. VI, I. 3.8 and PMS IV. 2. 19). PMS XI. 2. 66-68 deal with an example of arthakarma. Cremating a sacrificer when dead with his implements of sacrifice (mentioned in Tai. S. I. 6. 8. 2-3) is pratipattikarma of the implements (P. M. S. XI. 3. 34). Manu V. 167 provides that if the wife of an āhitāgni dies before him she is to be cremated with the sacred fires set up by him and with the sacrificial implements. An example of the third kind of niyama ( which is not concerned with pratinidhi or pratipatti) is 'one should take big meal, 2003 facing the east'. A man can take food facing any direction but this restricts him to the east alone. Here no question of a pratinidhi or of pratipatti arisons. 

Vidhis are also divided into Kratrartha (for the rite) and Puruṣārtha ( for the man) They are concerned with 'Prayukti'. (motivating force) which is the subject of chapter IV of the PM. S. P. M. S. IV. 1. 2 defines 2001 puruṣārtha and Sabara advances three interpretations of that sūtra, one of which is '(Puruṣartha) is that matter on doing which follows the happiness of man, as its understanding is due to man's desire for obtaining it (happiness) and puruṣartha (man's purpose) is not different (from happiness)', From this rather obscure and clumsy definition it appears to follow that puruṣārtha is what a man ordinarily undertakes for securing the reward of happiness, while kratvartha is that which helps in the accomplishment of purūṣārtha and does not itself directly yield any toward to the performer. All principal sacri fices like Darśa-pūrṇamāsa are included under puruṣārtha, while under kratvartha are put all those auxiliary acts that have the

purpose of accomplishing the principal rite itself e. g. the five 2005 prayājas that are auxiliary to the Darsapūrpamāsa are Kratvar tha, while Darbapūrṇamāsa itself is puruṣārtha. The importance of this distinction lies in this that if what is kratvartha is not followed the rite itself becomes defective, while if what is puruṣārtha is not followed, the result is that the man himself becomes blamable or sinful but the undertaking or rite does not become defective. One set of the three interpretations of P. M. 8. IV. 1. % given by Sabara is that it refers to the rules about the acquisition of wealth viz, that a brāhmaṇa should earn wealth by receiving gifts, a kṣatriya by conquest and a veibya by agriculture and the like (vide Gaut. X. 40-42, Manu X. 76-79). These are in the nature of niyamas. If the aoquisition of wealth is kratvartha and, if one acquires wealth by means other than those prescribed by the Śāstra and performs a sacrifice with such wealth, the sacrifice itself would be defective and would not yield the desired reward. But if the acquisition of wealth be puruṣārtha, then, by whatever means wealth with which & yāga is to be performed be obtained, the sacrifice would not be affected. The Mit. on 2006 Yaj. II. 114 quotes a passage from Guru Prabhākara (vide note 1947) which is quoted by the Dāyabhāga also (II. 67 ) but without name, while the Sm. C. II. pp. 257-58). Madanaratna (on Vyavahāra pp. 324-325) and Vyavabāraprakāśa (p. 420) quote a similar passage from the Nayaviveka. Viśvarūpa also on Yāj. II. 144 holds that rules about acquisition of wealth are puruṣārtha'. To acquire wealth is natural to man and acquisition of wealth does not depend upon Sastra. Besides, every one can directly perceive that wealth when earned confers pleasure on the acquirer. Therefore, wealth is puruṣārtha and sacrifices which are performed with wealth are also puruṣārtha. The general rule is that all angas ( auxiliary rites) are kratvartha and all principal rites (like 

2005. The Tai. S. III. 6. 1. 1 mentions five prayājas (oblations of clarified butter ) introductory to the principal offerings of Darsapūraamāsa viz. Samidbo yajatl, tanīgapātam yajati, iờo yajati, barbir-yajati, svābākāram yajati.' There is a difference of view as to whether these are dames of rites or of devatās. Vide H, of Dh. Pol.

Darbapūrpamisa, Somayaga) are puruṣartha; all texts presori bing the rewards of rites are puruṣārtha. Some individual examples may be given. 

In the Saṅkhāyana Br. (VI. 6) after saying that certain observances ( vrata) must be followed by the sacrificer, it is provided that he should not see the sun rising or setting. These observances are called 'Prajāpativratāni' by Sabara, and are declared by him to be puruṣartha, the meaning being that the sacrificer should make a resolve not to see the rising or setting sun. 

This distinction betwaon Kratvartha and Puruṣartha is often taken over into Dharmaśāstra matters. For example, Yaj. I. 53 provides that one should marry a girl who is free from diseases, has a brother and who does not belong to the same gotra or pravara as that of the bridegroom. The Mit 2007 explains that the status of being a wife does not at all arise it the girl is a sapinda or is of the same gotra or pravara as the bridegroom (i. e, marriage itself is null and void), but a girl who has some disease when married becomes a wife, the only result being that there is a visible defect (such as a diseased wife is a . constant source of anxiety and unbappiness). Kullūka on Manu IL, 7 (providing that one should not marry a girl from a family in which provail diseases like phthisis, epilepsy, white and black leprosy, refers to this doctrine of Sabara elaborated above. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 280 quotes a verse 'a wise man should not marry a girl who has no brother, por father, for fear that she may be a putrika (daughter appointed as a son).' Here the prohibition is like the prohibition of marrying a deformed girl i. e. it is a perceptible purpose. Therefore, the marriage would be valid i. e. the prohibition is puruṣārtha. Manu says (IX. 168) 'that is known to be an adopted son whom the mother or father might give ( to another) with water in a time of distress &o.'. The Mit, on Yaj. II. 130 quotes this verse and remarks that, as the word 'distress' is specifically mentioned, & son is not to be given in adoption to another when there is no distress and that this prohibition would affect only the giver (but not the act of adoption) i, e. this prohibition would be

Ṛratvartha and Purugārtha distinguished 1235 puruṣārtha and not kratvartha. 2008 It may be noted that the Vyavahāramayūkba disagrees and holds that the prohibition is kratyartha. It may be said in a general way that those prescrip tions that have an invisible, spiritual or othor-worldly result or reward are kratvartha, while those that have a visible result are puruṣārtha. 

Before proceeding further it is necessary to analyse the notions underlying the word 'yajeta' used in such Vedic sentences as 'one desiring heaven should offer & sacrifics' (svargakāmo yajeta). In the word 'yajeta ' 2009 there are two parts viz. the root yaj' (to sacrifice) and the termination (of injunctive third person singular). In the termination also there are two parts (elements ) viz, general verbal nature and injunctiveness (or injunctive force). General verbal nature is found in the ten lakūras (verbal formg in ton moods and tenses ), but injunctiveness is found only in the injunctive form. Both general verbal nature and injunctiveness express only bhāvanā (force that brings into being something, efficient force ). Bhāvanā (lit.) means a particular operation or activity of an agent which conduces to the coming into being of the result (Lit. which is to come into being). And this bhāvanā is of two kirds, sābdi ( word force) and arthi (result-producing force ). 

It has been already stated that vidhia are the very core of the Veda. The doctrine of bhāvana is the very heart of vidhis and is therefore one of the most important doctrines of the 

mimamsa. 

In ordinary life when a person says to another this should be done by you', the prompting to do something comes from a person. But Veda has according to the Mimarisi no author, human or divine. Therefore, in a Vedic vidhi the promp ting arises from the injunctive or the optative form of the word; there is no person, human of divine, behind the injunotion; hence the bhāvanā is said to be sābdi (i. e. based on the word itself and not on the will or direction of a person). There

1986 History of Dharmalāstra i Seo. VII, Oh. XXIX fore, sabdi-bhavanā is defined as a particular operation (or aotivity) of an agent (here the word of the Voda) that conduces to the activity of a man; and it is expressed by that part or element which is optative. It is called 'śābdi' because it is * sabdaniṣtha (centred in the word of the Veda) and not puruṣaniṣtha (centred in a person). In a śābdibhāvanā there are three elements viz. (1) there is prompting of the agent to activity. (2) the injunction is the instrument and (3) the manner is furnished by the desirableness proclaimed by artha vāda passages. The sābdi-bhāvanā gives rise to arthi-bhiyanā. In an arthi-bhāvanā ( that aims at or seeks the artha, the phala) also there are three elements viz. (1) svarga is the phala that is to be brought about, (2) the means or instrument is yaga, (3) there is also the procedure or method (itikartavyatā) of the yāga. All this is based on the P. M. S. sūtra II. 1. 1, on Sabara's bhāsya and certain important verses of the Tantravārtika quoted below. This whole discussion leads on to the idea of apūrra. Yāga lasts for a short time, while avarga comes to a man after death, which may be years after the performance of the sacrifice. What is the connecting link between yāga and svarga (the cause and the result)? It is the force or potency generated by yāgs that brings about svarga. 

Briefly, the idea is; both the root and the affix together express the sense of the affix and as the bhāvanā is the prinopal element in this, it is held to be the sense of the affix. There are numerous 2010 'bhāvaśabdas' such as yajati, juhoti, dadati,

dogdhi, pinasti. These are of two sorts, viz. pradhana (principal) and gunabhūta, 2012 Those by which a substance is not intended to be produced or embellished (or made fit) for a religious rite, are expressive of principal karma (such as prayājas ), while those which are meant to produce a substance or to make a substance fit are gunabhuła (such as pounding rice grains or chiselling a piece of wood for making a sacrificial post, wiping stuc ladle). Therefore the latter kind of actions are called gunakarma. There are two kinds of verbal forms (1) those in which the form only conveys that the kartā ( doer of the action) exists such as the forms 'asti, bhavati, vidyate'; (2) there are others where not only there is the existence of the kartā but there is also the understanding of some activity that produces a result such as 'yajati' (meaning 'yagam karoti'), ' dadati' (i. e. dānam karoti), 'pacati' (pakam karoti), 'gacchati' i. e. gamanam karoti). That is, in such cases the sense of karoti is also understood. Jaimini (in P. M. S. II. 1. 4) divides words into two classes viz. Namāni (nouns) and Karmasabdoh (verbs). Under the firat Sabara would include pronouns and adjectives. The 2nd is called "ākhyāta'. Sabara (on II. 1. 3.) paraphrases (namani as dravya-gunasabdah' and remarks that in the sutra (II. 1. 3) the word 'nāmāni' is employed in the sense of dravyagunasabdah ' 2012.

We must now turn to the 2nd great division of Vedic texto, viz. Arthavādas. They are dealt with in P. M. S. first adhyāya, ind pāda. There are numerous Vodic passages such as 'he roared; because he roared he came to be called Rudra' (Tai. $. I. 5. 1. 1.), 'Prajāpati cut out his own fat' (Tai. S. II, 1. 1.4), the gods, having reached the sacrificial ground, did not know the directions' (Tai. S. VI, 1. 5. 1.); who knows whether one lives in the other world or not '(Tai. S. VI. I. 1. 1.); 'thore should be no piling of fire altar on the earth nor in the sky nor in heaven' (Tai. S. V, 2.7.1). The objector says 'you have yourself declared that enjoining religious rites is the purpose of the Veda' (P. M. S. I. 1.2). The above and similar passages do not serve any purpose in the matter of religious acts, they are therefore uselegg and are non-eternal (or do not refer to any permanent matter). The reply is that these passages form one syntactical or connected whole with hortatory passages of the Veda and they serye the purpose of commending (or glorifying) the hortatory passages. Sabara cites on I. 2. 7 the passage 'one desiring prosperity gbould sacrifice a white animal in honour of Vāyu; Vāyu indeed is the swiftest deity; he runs near Vāyu with the share proper (to Vāyu); he (Vāyu) leads the sacrificer to prosperity'. 2011 These words form one whole passage; the first

part vāyavyam,.,bhūtikāmaḥ is clearly a vidhi, as the word alabheta (in the optative form) shows. The latter portion is an arthavāda for the purpose of commendation. People are familiar with the fact that Vāyu is swift. Therefore, the latter portion (Vāyurvai &c.) merely repeats what is already well known that is, it is an anuvāda). In sātras 19–25 of I. 2 the P. M. 8. considers certain passages that look like vidhis but are declared to be arthavādas. For example, (Tai 8. I. 1. 1.6) the sacrificial post is to be of udumbara wood; the udumbara wood is indeed vigour (or food or sap); cattle aro vigour; by this strong (or juicy) post, he ( sacrificer) secures cattle, for the securing of strength'. The objector says that this is a phalavidhi (an injunctive text about a result) as the words 'ūrjosvara ddhyai' contain the purpose and there is no word of commenda tion. The reply is that there is only commendation. 

There are some passages in the Veda in which occur words like 'hi' (because) such as in 'one should offer into fire the oblation with the winnowing basket, because food is prepared by means of it' (Tai. Br. I. 6.5). 2015 The question that arises is

The word airy in the sūtra is purposely used. Veda is pitya and therefore pramāṇa. Hence the passages not referring to any religious rite are different from the portion dealing with rites and aditya i. e. apramāṇa (not authoritative).

The position of the P. M. S. is that what Veda declares is authoritative; there is no need to cite reasons for the statements of the Veda. It may cite a reason for its declaration, even though no necessity exists.

whether this and other passages containing words denoting reason should be construed as arthavadas commending what is onjoined in the preceding sentence or whether as stating & reason for the injunction. The established conclusion is that they are commendatory. If the other view were adopted ( viz. that śruti gives a reason for the vidhi) then it may be argued that the ladle, pan and other utensils also may be used for making an offering (not merely the sūrpa), as they also are required in preparing food. Ragbunandana in Malamāsatattva p. 760 relies upon and explains this maxim with reference to Laghu-Harita's words 'cak ravat parivarteta sūryab kālavasād yatah'. It should not be supposed that commendation (stuti) is the purpose of all arthavādag. In 'he lays down anointed pebbles, ghee is indeed brilliance' (Tai. Br. III. 2. 5. 12) a doubt arises about the material with which pebbles are to be anointed. That doubt is removed by the remainder of the passage that it is ghee with which they are to be anointed ( P. M. S. I. 4. 24 ) 

Arthavādas are of three kinds viz. gupavāda, anuvada and bhūtārthavāda; 'when an artbavāda text is in conflict with ordinary experience it is metaphorical; when something is definitely ascertained by other means of knowledge and becomes the subject of a text it is called anuvāda and when a text is not opposed to other pramānas or is not definitely ascertained otherwise, it is called 'bhūtārthavada' (statement of an accompli. shed fact, or of a past event); in this way arthavāda is of three kinds'. 2016 An example of the first kind is' during day-time

only the smoke of fire is geen and not its flame'(this is Tai. Br. II. 1. 2. 10). One sees both smoke and fire during the day and night. What this text desires to emphasize is that by day the light of fire is not so well soon as at night (or not well seen from a distance by day as at night ). 

'Fire is the medicine (antidote ) for cold' (Vaj. S. 23. 10 and Tai. S. VII. 4. 18. 2) is cited by some as an example of anuvāda. The M. B. P. finds fault with this on the ground that it is well-known as a mantra and does not form part of a vidhi by syntactical relation, and that it is cited by Nṭeimhāśrama as an example owing to neglect of the study of the Veda or absent mindedness. A proper example would be 'Vayu indeed is the swiftest deity' cited above. 'Prajāpati cut off his own fat' is cited by some as an example of bhūtārthavada, but the M. B.P. does not approve of it and cites the perse 'yan-na duhkhena sambhinnam'(cited above in note 1969) as an example.

Wbere a statement ( not being a vidbi) is neither an aoavada nor a gunavāda it is called vidyamāsavāda or bhūtārthavāda. This is lucidly explained by Sabara in P.M. S.

happened in bygone ages). 2016 Devala states that sages have laid down expiation for the first wrong, for committing a second double of that, for committing a third time thrice as much but there is no expiation for committing it a fourth time. The Prāyaścitta-prakaraṇa of Bhavadova says that this is not to be taken literally, but it is only nindārthavāda. The P. M. S. itself (VI. 7. 26 and 30 ) states that paraksti and purakalpa are arthavādas. 

The Vyavahāra-mayūkha quotes & verge of Devala 2017 on the father's death the sons should divide the paternal wealth, for they have no ownership as long as the father who suffers from no blemish (that deprive him of ownership) is alive'. Here the first half lays down a time for partition (it is a vidhi), the latter half is only an arthavāda praising the vidbi and means that, as long as the father is alive, the sons are not independent and not that they have no ownership in ancestral property. 

Smptis also abound in arthavādas. For example, Medhātithi on Manu V. 56 (na māmsabhakṣane doṣaḥ) says that from V. 28 up to V. 56 all verses except two or three are arthavādas. Medhātithi points out in several other places in the Manusmrti a few vidhis and numerous arthavādas. For example, Manu II, 117 contains a vidhi about abhitādana, while verses II.

118-121 are arthavādas in relation to it. In Manu II, 165 a vidhi is laid down for the study of the whole Veda by persons of the three upper classes; when Mano (X. I) again lays down that the three classes should study the Veda, this is merely an anuvāda. Medhātithi on Mapu. IX. 135 remarks that many verses in Manu contain arthavād as. 

The Vasiṣtha-dharmasūtra and Viṣṇudharmottara W18 provide that cow's urine, excreta, milk, ourds, clarified butter, water in which kuśas have been dipped and a fast for a day and night will purify even a svapāka. A Syapāka was the lowest amongst untouchables and followed the same avocations as a cāṇdāla and was governed by the same rules (vide Manu X. 51-56 ). This Verge is not to be taken literally, as nothing could make a . cāṇdāla touchable, Therefore, this is a more arthayāda meant to praise the purifying effects of pañcagavya and a fast. 

It would have been noticed that every Vedic passage is not of the nature of & vidhi (of an injunctive or exhortatory character). There are numerous Vedic passages that are commendatory of a vidhi, condemn an act that is prohibited, give an illustration of some one baving performed the vidhi in the past or pat forward an easily understood reason for the specifio act which is enjoined. These commendatory, condemna tory and illustrative passages are not to be treated as unnecessary or purposeless, but are to be taken along with the vidhi passages to complete their full import.. This doctrine of arthayādas savas a huge portion of Vedic texts from being neglected or treated as - unnecessary. 

The Garuḍapurāṇa states 'Gāndhāri, who observed a fast on Ekadasi mixed with daśamī, lost her hundred sons; therefore Ekādaśī mixed with dasami should be given up'. Here the first part is only s nindānuvada (i. e. it indirectly supports the positive rule tām parivarjayot'), as the maxim is that'ninda in & text is not meant for the mere sake of condemnation but for prescribing the opposite of what is condemned.' Vide.Kștyarat nākara p. 635 for this interpretation. The M. B. P. (pp. 50-58) gives another classification of arthayādas into 38 varieties. They are passed over here from considerations of space. 

The arthavādas constitute the largest part of the Veda, particulary in the Brāhmaṇa texts. About ārthavāda the

1844 





Tantravārtika makes 2019 a general statement that arthavada passages coming after vidhi passages are weak, while those that come before vidhis are stronger. 

The 3rd class of Vedic texts are mantras. They have already been treated above (vide p. 1220, notes 1979 ff.). Some mantras also lay down an injunction as in Rg. X. 117.5 'poplyad-in nadhamānāya-tavyān' (the strong must bestow wealth on one who begs), also the mantra "vasantāga kapiñjalanalabhate' (Vaj. S. 24. 20 ) cited above on p. 1221. But generally mantras are only expressive or assertive and call to mind things that are connected with the acts enjoined by vidhi-vakyas (injunotive passages ). The Tantravārtika 2020 notes that it is definitely understood that religious acts that are performed with mantras that recall to the mind the things enjoined lead to prosperity (or to srarga). The reader would notice how the Pūrvamimātisa system came to relegate mantras to a secondary place and made thom play a passive role in the sacrificial system. The Rgveda contained sublime prayers, but in the mimāṁsā system the most prominent place was given to Brāhmaṇa texts, that contained almost all the ridhis. It has been seen above pp. 950-952 how Rgveda mantras are full of faith (bhakti) in God and forvent appeals to God after confession of sin and repentance; vide Rg. VIL. 86. 4-6 ( kim-aga āga varuṇa jyestham &c.); Rg. III. 39 in a hymn full of beatitude, verge 2 of which saya 'this prayer (dhih) born of yore in heaven, sung in the holy assembly with earnestDess, dressed in pure (lit-white) and auspicious garb is ours, ancient and inherited from our forefathers' . 

The 4th part of Vedic texts bearing on Dharma is 'Nama dheya' (proper names of sacrifices). There are such texts as 

• one should sacrifice with the udbhid' (Tāpdya Br. 19. 7. 2-3), *one desirous of possessing cattle should sacrifice with citrā' u1 (Tai. 8. IL. 4.6.1). The question is whether in these passages what is laid down is some substance to be offered in some rite ( as in

dadhna juhoti) or whether they are names of sacrificos. No substance is well-known as "udbhid' (as dadhi is a well-known substance). Citrā means a female animal of variegated colour. If it is gunavidhi (in the case of citrayā yajeta'), there would be the fault of Vākyabheda (one sentence broken up as laying down two vidhis) i.e. the injunction would be that a female paśu was to be sacrificed (not a male) and further injunotion that its colour should be variegated. Therefore, Udbhid, Citra, Balabhid, Abhijit, Viśvajit ( Kausitaki Br. 25. 14) and Agnihot ra (P. M. 8. 1. 4. 4), Vājapoya (P. M. 8. I. 4. 6-8). Vaiśvadeva (P. M. 8. I. 4. 13-16) are names of rites and are not substances: Similarly, in 'Syonenabhicaran yajeta' (one practising black magic for bringing about the death of an enemy may perform & yāga called syona). Here 'syena' is the name of a yāga, because the yāga swoops down upon the enemy and seizes him just as a falcon swoops down upon its victim and catches it (Ṣadvimga Br. III. 8. 1.3). The point to be noted is that these names gerve the purpose of 2022 particularising the meaning of what is enjoined. The Vedic text 'svādhyāyosdhyetavyaḥ' enjoins the study of the Veda consisting of all parts including nāmadheyas of sacrifices and we directly see that in such Vedic vidhis as 'Citrayā yajeta pasukamah' the name cifra is a part of the vidhi. Therefore, nāmadheya also is a puruṣārtha and is authoritative like other parts of the Voda (vide Sastradipika on Jai, I. 4,1). In the sentences mentioned above yāga is enjoined with the fruit as the object, since it is not otherwise established. Since it is not intended to lay down & general injunction to sacrifice, a specific variety of sacrifice has to be enjoined. When one wants to know the specific variety enjoined, from the word 'udbhid' it is known that it is the sacrifice called udbhid. Dharmaśāstra writers apply this maxim called 'Udbhid-nyāya' to 'Upanayang' which literally means 'taking (a boy ) near &o ācārya' (teacher of the Veda)'.

History of Dharmaśāstra (Sco. VII, Ch. XXIX The fifth (and last) part of Vedic texts consists of pratiṣedha'(niṣedha, prohibition). Prohibitions 2024 serve the enda of man by causing mon to desist from actions which would produce undesirable results. To explain, just as vidhis, which express an urge or prompting (to do something), suggest, in order to effectuate their prompting quality, that the matter to be enjoined such as a sacrifice is the means to attain a desirable result and so urge a man to do it, so also prohibitions such as 

one should not eat Kalanja (red garlic)' or 'one should not utter what is false' (Tai. S. II. 5. 5.6) denote a turning away and in order to effectuate their own deterring quality, suggest that the thing to be prohibited viz. eating kalañja or speaking untruth will be the cause of bringing about an undesirable result and so make a man desist from it. The particle 'na' may come before a verbal form, a noun or an adjective and 'na' becomes in certain casos 'a' (as in 'abrāhmaṇa,' 'adharma') and 'an' in certain others whon it is prefixed to a word begind ing with a vowel (as in 'anaśva', 'anuṣna'). Pāṇini devotes several sūtras to 'na' and expressly refers to 'pratiṣedha' as one of the meanings conveyed by 'na' (vide Pān. II. 2. 6, VI. 2. 155 &c.) 2075 ; 'na' is said to convey six senses as noted in the verge quoted below. 2026 

The first meaning of 'na' is 'abhāva' (non-existence ). But that meaning would not suit all cases. When one says 'bring abrābmana' the meaning conveyed is not non-existence' since, if that were the meaning, one could not bring non-exist ing brāhmaṇa and so might not bring any one at all, or might

Meanings of 'na'

bring a clod of earth which would not fulfil any purpose of the person addressing these words and therefore, on hearing this, a person not & brāhmaṇa but resembling a brahmana (such as a ksatriya) is brought. So in this case 'abrāhmaṇa' means & person other than a brāhmaṇa; 'na' also conveys the opposite (virodha) of that to which it is prefixed. It has been seen above that the verb is the main part in a sentence and in the verbal form it is the tormination that is the principal part. 80, in one must not eat kalaija' the negative particle 'na' must be held to be connected with the optative termination in 'bhak sayet'. In a vidhi 20n (or on hearing a vidhi) one perceives that the sentence urges the listener to be active. When 'na'is prefixed to an optative from it conveys the opposite of trging viz. ' nivartana' (desisting from something). The phala that one understands from & vidhi is as in 'yajeta svargakamah' starga, while in a prohibition the phala is cessation of harm (anartha-nivrtti). The adhikari in a vidhi is one who desires gvarga; in a niṣedha the adhikari is one who is afraid of harm and desires to avoid what is undesirable. Therefore, these considerations establish that exhortation and probibition are entirely different in their import. 

But when there is an obstacle or difficulty in construing 'na' with the verbal termination, then it is construed with the meaning of the root. These obstacles are of two sorts; one is where the whole passage is introduced by the words his yows are * or where an option will emerge if the meaning of prohibition is stuck to. In the case of these two obstacles in sentences where

'na' occurs, we would have to resort to paryudāsa (exclusion or exception). In the case of the Prajāpativratas 2078 (which are purusārtha as decided in P. M. S. IV. 1. 3) the passage starts with the words his vows aro' and then comes the sentence 'he must not see the sun irising or setting' (Kausitaki Br. VI. 6). Vrata means a mental act, a resolve not to do a certain thing, the meaning being 'he should make a resolve to act in such a way as not to see the rising or setting sun and stick to it', This really is niyama (restriction). This passage does not mean that he should never look at the sun (there is no probibi. tion of seving the sun) but it only excludes the sight of the rising or setting sun; therefore, this is only exclusion and he who observes this niyama (restriction) secures the reward while in the case of eating kalanja there is a total prohibition. 'Paryudāsa (exclusion) is to be understood where the negative particle is taken with another word (i e. with the verbal root or a different word such as a noun); probibition is to be understood where the negative particle is taken with the verbal form', 

In Dharmaśāstra works, 'na' is frequently explained as laying down a paryudāsa (proviso or exception). In the section on the duties of a smūtulu in Yāj. I. 129-166 'na' occurs very often. The Mit. explains (on Yaj. I. 129) that in this section wherever na' occurs it is meant to denoto a paryudāga (sarva trāpi asmin snatakaprakarane nan-sabdaḥ pratyekam paryudi sārtha eva), To take only one example, Yaj. in I. 132 provides that one should not speak (to a man or woman) what would be painful without any necessity or cause. This does not altogether prohibit speaking what is painful; what it means is that a snūtaka may say to another what is painful except when there is no proper reason nor proper oocasion to do so. One may have to speak what is painful to an erring son or friend or near relative. Aparārka (pp. 206-207) quotes two well-known

verses on the distinction between paryudāsa and pratizedha (the two balvos of whioh are quoted and underlined in nota 2027) on the interpretation of a verse requiring a man having a son not to observe a fast on certain days &c. The first halves of those verses aro; 'Pradhanatvam vidbauyatra pratigedhespradhā Datā (paryudāsaḥ...nan) || aprādhānyam vidhau yatra pratizedbe pradhānatā prasajyaprati...mañ'.ll 

When the particle 'da' is employed in a sentence, it is either & prohibition or a paryudāsa or an arthavada, These three have to be clearly distinguished.) In Darsapūrpamāsa the two ajyabhāgas are an anga (P. M. S. IV. 4. 30) and & passage states that the two ajyabhāgas are the eyes of the Darsapūrpamāsa saorifice. 1029 In connection with this the Veda says these two are not performed in an animal sacrifice nor in a Soma sacrifice'. The question is; is this a prohibition a & paryudāsa or an arthavāda. A pratiṣedha occurs only when there is the possibility of what is prohibited following as a matter of course. As the ājyabhāgas are prescribed in Darśapā roaṁāga there is no possibility of these two being required in a Somayāga and there is no real prohibition. Nor is there paryudāsu, for if it be a paryudāda there would be no proper connection, since in paryudāsa one would have to say there are ājyabhāgas in darśapūrṇamāsa except in somayāgs', which would be absurd. Therefore, these words 'na tan paśau karoti na some' contain an arthavāda. A true 180 prohibition would occur only when something is first prescribed and then prohibited. The stock example is of the Sodasin cup; there are two Vedic sentences of equal authority he takes the sodasin oup in Atiratra' and he does not take the ṣodasin cup in atirātra'; owing to this conflict an option is allowed. Similarly, there is a Vedic passage Vrihibhir yajeta yayairyā' (one shall offer a. sacrifice with grains of rice or with yavas). Therefore, in the above two cases where the two texts are irreconcilable, there is

no way except that of allowing an option (vikalpa). But 

vikalpa' is liable to eight faults. 2031 Therefore, an effort has to be made to avoid option and accept as far as possible a paryu dasa or arthavāda, since by accepting an option, the authorita tive statement in one case or the other has to be regarded as unauthoritative and not binding. Sabara and Tantravārtika provide that vikalpa should be resorted to only in case there is no other way. The P. M. S. lays down that vikalpa may be accepted when several things having the same object (or sense) are stated by several authoritative texts. 

There is one more word that must be explained, viz. mityānuvāda. 2032 This word occurs in Āpastambadharmasūtra II, 6. 14. 13 (vide n. 1877 above). It occurs frequently in Jaimini ( vide II. 4. 26, IV. I. 5, VI. 7. 30, VII, 4.5, VIII. 1. 6, IX. 4, 36, X. 2.38 ) and Sabara uses it oftener still. He explains that where the Vedic text apparently prohibits something when there is no possibility of what is prohibited as happening, there is nityānu vāda ( as in the fire altar should not be piled on bare earth nor in the sky nor in heaven'). The Tupṭikā states the same thing in & different form when it says that where a prohibition amounts to an arthavada, that is nityanuvāda. 

Vikalpas (options) are grouped under three headṣ viz. those indicated by logio or reasoning, (2) those due to express words and (3) those dependent on the will of the performer. Au example of the first kind is the option about rice grains and barley grains (yavair yrihibhir-vā yajeta). The 2nd may be exemplified from Manu III. 267, which says that the Manos derive satisfaction for a month whon offerings are made of sesame or of rice or of barley or of māsa pulse or of water or of fruits and roots.

Option depending on a man's will exemplified 1351 "An option depending on the will of a person osoars in the Jābālopaniṣad 2033 (4) after finishing the period of studenthood one should become a householder, after becoming a householder, one should become a forest hermit and after becoming a forest hermit one may become & wandering ascetic (sannyāsin or parivrād ); or following another method one may become & wandering ascetic after finishing studenthood or after becoming an householder or after becoming a forest hermit.' The latter part of this passage gives an option as to āśramas.' This option is referred to by Gautama in the words some sages allow an option as to asramas to him (to brahmacārin).' When Yāj. I. 14 provides that the Upanayana of a brāhmaṇa boy may be performed in the eighth year from conception or from birth there is an option depending on the will of the father. 

Manu IV.7 provides that a dvija should amass as much corn as would fill a granary (i. e. as would last for a year) or a Kumbhi (for six months) or as much as would suffice for three days or may not care to amass oven for to-morrow. These are four options and then Manu IV. 8 provides that a dvija who is an householder may choose one of these four, but each sucoeed ing one is superior in point of merit and otherworldly rewards. 

A vikalpa may also be vyavasthita (restrioted or limited to a certain set of circumstances) or avyavasthita (not restricted). The Āp. Dh. S. provides 2034 that one should offer bali with his hand in the aupāsana fire or in the kitchen fire with the first six mantras. Haradatta remarks that "This is a limited option viz. in the aupāsana fire bali should be cast every day by those who have kept up that fire and in the ordinary kitchen fire by

When Manu IV.95 prescribes “Having performed the Upakarma rite according to proper procedure on the Full Moon of Srāvaṇa or of Bhadrapada a brāhmana should diligently study the Vedas for four months and a half." Medhātithi says that this is a * vyavasthita-rikalpa' viz. the Sāmavedins should perform upākarma on Bhadrapada Full Moon, while Rgvedins and Yajurveding on Srāvana Full Moon. Vide thy Mit. on Yaj. I. 254 about the supiṇlanı of a mother, where the Mit. introdu ces order among conflicting toxts. When Gaut. prescribes (III. 21) that & sannyūsin should completoly shave the head or keep only a top-knot, there is an option depending on the will of the person. Gaut. II, 51-53, Ap. Dh. S. I. 2. 11, Manu III. 1 proscribe brahmacarya for Veda study for 18, 36, 24, 12, 3 years. Here there is an option depending on the capacity and wish of the student. It should be noted that the eight faults about accepting an option do not occur in a vyavasthita 2035 vikalpa nor do they apply where the option is dependent on the volition of the performer nor where option is given by express texts. Those eight faults apply only to an option indicated by reasoning 

The Mimāmgābālāprakāsa (pp. 153-165 ) provides a long list of the divisions and subdivisions of Vikalpa. 

Sastra is meant to give definite rules as stated by Patañjali 2036 and therefore all Sastrik works try to reduce options to the minimum and assign to apparently conflicting passages separate and definite provinces of application (Visayjavyavas thā). Sometimes, the options are so many that commentators give up the task of assigning thein different scopes e. g, the Mit. on Yaj. III. 22, after quoting the conficting passages on impurity on birth and death, for ksatriyas, vaisyas and sūdras

Two other words require some explanation. They are arādupakiraka' and 'sannipatyopakāraka'. In the 3rd chapter of the PMS the author deals 2037 with seṣa, its definition and explains how to determine what things are called śeṣa and what are seṣin Kumārila sets out five definitions of the word sesa, discards four and accepts one, viz. 'ßoṣa' is that which serves the purpose of another, Sabara comments that what serves to help another is called śeṣa and the other is called seṣin Sabar& adds & qualification viz. that is seṣa which is of very much help to another. Bādari holds that there are three groups of sesa viz. dravya (materials for sacrifice such as rico-grains), guna (such as the reddish colour of the cow that is · the price of the soma to be purchased), sainskāras (purificatory acts such as the pounding of the grains in mortar and pestle which make the grains fit for turning them into purodāśa ). Jaimidi adds that ritos (karmāpi) like yāga, fruit or regult (of gāga) are sesa as regards the performer and the performor is śesa with reference to the yāga. According to Bādari, drapya, guna, sanskāra are always seṣa, while according to the establi shed conclusion, yāga, reward and performer (Vāga, phala and puruṣa) may be according to circumstances either sosa or sesin, After a long discussion the Tantravārtika sumg up the discussion that dravya, guṇa, and samskāra are with reference to yāga invariably sasa, though they may be seṣin with reference to their own constituent elements, while 88 regards phala, vāga and the performør they can be both śoṣa and beṣin with reference to each other. For example, in the Darga-Pūrṇamāga sacrifice there are various items, such as taking out handfuls of rice grains (for sacrifice), sprinkling water on them, pounding then; then cortain acts are to be performed with reference to ajya (clarified butter) viz. purifying it with two blades of kuta grase, melting it, also bringing a branch, starting the cows towards the meadows &c. Those auxillarles are of two kind, viz (i) that are already sccomplished, (ii) that are of the nature

of actions. The first comprehend substances, number &0.; those that are of the nature of acts are two-fold viz. sannipatyopakūraka and ārād-upakāraka. In the Paurpatāsi rite there are such auxiliaries as Prayājas, the Aghāras, the Ajyabhāgas. These are ārādupakāraka. Sannipatyopakārakag are also called sama Vāyika, or aśrayikarmāpi; they are such as the pounding of grains, prokṣına etc. The Arādupakāraka &re 2038 rites presori. bed without being meant to do something about substances and are directly the angas of the principal rite. These do not give rise to any samnskāra (embellishment or making fit) in the substance meant to be offered in sacrifice, are helpful in producing the paramāpūrva that yields the fruit of the whole rite. They produce a subordinate apūrva of their own. They are directly angas of the principal rite and are distinguished from sannipatyopakārakas, which are samskāraka (bring about some embellishment or fitness). The Sannipatyopakārakas are more powerful than Ārādupakārakas and therefore the Tantra Vārtika states the proposition that where it is possible to hold an act 2039 in a rite to be sandipatyopakāraka or sāmayayika, it is not proper to regard it as ārādupakāraka. It is somewhat remarkable that Prof. Keith in his 'Karmamimāṁsā' (p. 88) inverts the meaning of these two words. The explanation of sanni patyopakāruka in ‘Prābhākara School' (by M. M. Jha) p. 181 also is rather obscure. The Ekādasitattva (p. 97), while discussing the substitutes (pratinidhis) to be employed on Ekādaśī for ghee, for milk and honey ( being milk-powder, curds and jaggery) quotes P. M. S.

Aradupakāraka rites for brahma-nõna 

1255 

V. S, IV. I. 16 states that the performanoe of obligatory vedic rites (liks Agnihotra) by a man who has to acquire knowledge of brahma is helpful for attaining it as an ārādupakāraka. 

Apart from the Veda and smrtis the Pūrvamīmāmsā relics upon or refers to loka or lokavat (usage of the ordinary people) fa elucidation. For example, I. 2. 20, L. 2. 29, II. 1. 12 (Lokarat), IV. 1.6 'tathā ca lokabhūteṣu' meaning 'lokepi'), VI, 2.16 (loke karmāni vedavat-tatosdhipuruṣajñānam), VI, 5. 34 (na bhaldi trād-esa hi loke), VI. 8. 26. (yāñca-krayanam-avidyamine lokavat), VII. 4. 11 (Lingahetutvād-alinge laukikam syāt), VI 2.22 (payo vā tat-pradhānatvāl-lokavad-dadhnas-tadarthatvat) gives the illustration that in order to solidify mik a little of curds is enough; VIII. 4.6, (da laukikādām &c. where 'laukikānām' means 'lokānām');X. 3,44 (sabdārthascapi lokavat), 

X. 3. 51, X. 6. 8, X. 7. 66 (Lokavat, Sabara saying *Yatha matsyāo na payasā samaśniyāt), XI. 1. 23, 26, 62. Sabara himself uses the word 'Laukikanyaya' in bhāsya on PMS I. 4. 13 (evam varṇyamāne laukikayāyānugataḥ sūtrartho varni to bbavisyati' p. 926 ). 2011 

Jaimini dealt with the eternal, self-existent and absolutely authoritative character of the Veda as regards Dharma in the first pāda of the first chapter and also dealt with the means of koowledge, the eternal character of the relation of words and senses. In the second pada of the first adhyāya he pronounced that arthavādas whioh form & very large portion of the Veda were meant to laud the Vidhis with which they were connected and were not to be treated as useless. He also provided that mantrag (that formed part of the voda) had & purpose to serve viz. that of recalling to the mind the meaning of the rites performed, that some mantras like 'oatvāri srñga'20410 (Rg.

58.3) are laudatory of yāga, by means of a metaphor, that the genge of some words in the mantras like Jarbhari turpharita (Rg. X, 106. 6) or 'Indraḥ somasya kāṇuka' (Rg. VIII. 77. 4) about which it is argued that no sense can be made out of them are really explicable with the help of Nirukta (etymology) and grammar, that some words like 'Kikata', 'Naicātākha', and 'Pramaganda', that are claimed to refer to a country, & city, a king and therefore are claimed to make the mantra (Rg. III, 53. 14) non-eternal, can be explained in a different way. In this way, no part of the Veda is anarthaka (without sense or useless ) or non eternal. The Mimārsakas are very keen on avoiding ānarthakya of any Vedic words or sentences. 

In the third pāde of the first chapter Jaimini deals with the authoritativeness of smrtis, the usages of respectable and learned people ( sadācāra), the Vedāngas &c. 

It appears that before Jaimini composed his sūtra, amitis had come into prominence and the usages of the śiṣṭas had been recognised as one of the sources of Dharma. The Dharma sutras of Gautama, Apastamba, and 2042 others had declared that the Vedas, the Smrtis and the usages of those who know the Vodas are the sources of Dharma.

Therefore, Jaimini had to consider whatbor smrtis and usages wore authoritative in the matter of Dharma and, if so, to what extent. Even if smrtis wore held to be unauthoritative, the authoritativeness of the Veda would not be affected; but the very first sūtra ( of P. M. S.) postulated that the work would consider the question about the characteristios of Dharma and, therefore, startis that were called Dharmaśāstra (Manu II. 10) were connected with the discussion about Dharma. Besides, from VI. 7.6 it follows that2013 Jaimini know Dharmaśāstras as he provide es that in & Viśvajit the performer cannot make a sūdra & subject of gift simply because he serves a man of higher caste on account of the ordinances of Dharmaśāstra. Even in the Upani ṣads (as in Tai. Up. 1.11) the teacher after the pupil had completed Veda study impresses upon the latter that whenever he would have a doubt about the rites enjoined or about propor conduct he should follow the conduct of brahmanas in his country that act after proper consideration, that are devoted to their duties and are not driven to do anything by another, are not harsh of character, that are intent on doing their duties. This amounts to following

montions three smrti rules, two of which oan be said to corres. pond with ortant srostis; on PMS VI, L 5, while dealing with the question whether lower animals (dogs &o.) have alhikāna for Vedic rites, Sabara denies their adhikara, since they do not study the Veda nor the smrtiśāstras (as mon do); on PMS VI. 2. 21-22 ( when the question is whether the smārta rules that a teacher should be followed or obeyed and obeisance be made to him and whether one should get up and honour an old man apply to even children whose upanayapa is not performed) Śabara states that smṛti is equal to Veda (Vedatulya hi amritih, vaidikā eva padirtha smaryanta ityuktam). On VI.8.23 he quotes one quarter of a sloka as smrti (smaranti-taṣu kaleṣu daivāni-iti). On VI. 7. 31 he says that smrti speaks of gandharvas living for a thousand years. On VI. I, 20 Sabara says a woman owns no wealth, if one followe smrti, but is owner of property if śruti be followed. On IX. 2. 2 Sabara says 'naisa smptib pramāṇam, dçstamālā hyeṣa '; on X. 1.36 Sabara says that from the usage of respectable people smrti is inferred and from smrti Sruti text is inferred; on X. I. 42 Sabara says 'Smrti is stronger than usage'. On X. 3. 47 Śabara saya 'there is a smrti that one should not sell a horse'. In one place Sabara employs the words pramāpāyām emptau' instead of 'pramāpe smftau' as one would expect and the Tantravārtika is at great pains to show that this lapse on the part of Sabara may be somebox justified (pp. 183-184) on 1. 3. 3. The Baudhayana Dh. 8. (1.1, 19–26 ) sets out five practicas peculiar to the countries of the South (Southern India) and five others peculiar to the North and says that if one belonging to the South follows any of the usages peculiar to the North and vice versa he would be guilty of sin, Vide H. of Db.

discarded, since smrtis were composed by men (i. e. they are pauruçeya and not apaurugeya, as the Veda is) and men are often deluded and forgetful. This is the main basis of the objector. To this the reply is that for prescriptions of the smtpis, there are passages in the Veda that suggest some of the smrti rules 8. g, that the Astakā srāddha was provalont long before the smrtis is indicated by the Vedic mantra 'yām janaḥ pratinan danti'. 2046 The Usages about obeying the teacher, about provid ing cisterns for travellers have a seon purpose, viz. the benefit of others. Even the Veda mentions prapā (Rg. IX. 4.1 'dhanya nniva prapā asi meaning' O Agnil thou art like a prapā in a desert'. The Tantravārtika is most exhaustive on this and the following sūtras, differs from the Bhāṣyakāra in many places, finds fault with him and gives alternative matters as the subjects for discussion. He puta forward two theories about smrti provisions for which it is impossible to suggest Vedic indications. He says (firstly) that Smrti 2017 prescriptions may be based on lost Vedic sākhas, or(2) they may be based on texts contained in the very parts of the Voda that are available at present. If any one asks 'bow is it that they are not found', Kumārila gives the reply: the several branches of the Veda are soattered about (in many distant territories ), mon are negligent, and the texts are contained in different sections of the Voda; on account of these one cannot point out the texts that are the basis of the emptis, 

That many Vedic texts were lost or are unavailable now was the view even before the days of the Ap. Dh. 8. (I, 4. 12. 10), which states ‘rites were promulgated in the Brāhmaṇa texts, but the exact words of the Brābmana texts) are lost and have to be inferred from the performance of the rites (or from procedure presoribed in Smrtis). 2048 There was danger in relying on the

s that PMS 1.303 be mentioned fore, only a 

theory that Smrtis were based on Vedic texts that are lost (or disappeared ), because that very argument might be urged by heterodox sects like the Bauddhas. 2049 Therefore, Kumārila put forward the other theory viz. the basis of smṛtis are texts that are not found in the existing vedic texts because the Vedic sūkhās are scattered about (as said in the verse quoted above). 

This whole subject about Smrtis according to the views of the Mimamsakas has been dealt with at great length by the author in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 827-841. Therefore, only a few examples and conclusions may be mentioned here. Sabara himself proposes that PMS I. 3. 4 2050 should form a separate Adhikarana by itself and puts forward an important maxim viz. where one can find out or ascribe a visible motive for an act one should not postulate an unseen Vedic text or a transcendental motive. 2051 The result of Sabara's dealing with PMS I. 3. 3-4 is neatly put by the Sāstradipikā as follow; Smṛti rules that are opposed to Śruti rules and such smrti provisions as can be shown to bave a clear worldly motive are not authoritative or binding, while the rest of smrti texts are authoritative. This doctrine is older than the Ap. Dh S. (1. 4. 10. 12) which provides 'where men act because they find pleasure in doing that act there Śāstra has no scope'. Kunıārila does not agree with Sabara. He says that visible and invisible or spiritual motives are often inextricably mixed up. "Unbusking rice grains' has a visible purpose in order that they may be well boiled and the boiled rice may be offered in a sacrifice. In this act then there is a visible purpose and get this act is prescribed by the Veda. In a trenchant, finely worded and very accommodating passage redolent of a cosmopolitan outlook and the desire to give avon the devil his due, Kumārila examines (in pp. 166-168) all the known classes of Sanskrit works with regard to their usefulness

and relation to Veda and ordinary worldly experience. Only a few sentences will be set out here and in the notes. Therefore, he provides that all Smrtis are authoritative according to the pur pose they servex Those parts of Smrtis that are concerned with Dharma and Moksa have the Veda as their source, while what over parts of Smstis are concerned with wealth (artha) and worldly pleasures ( kūma) are based on worldly practices. The same rule applies to the hortatory passages of Itihāsa (the Mahābhārata) and Purāṇas, both of which are often spoken of as Smṛti. The episodes and tales in these two should be taken ag arthavādas. Then he refers to the descriptions of the divisions of the earth and the vamsas (dynastio lists) (both of which are among the subjects treated of in the Puranas) and sets out the purposes they might serve. The six Vedāngas (grammar, metrios, etymology, astronomy &c.) are useful as kratvartha and puruṣārtha, and Mimārgā and Nyāya (logic) have been establi- - shed (worked up) from worldly experience by means of pratyaksa (direct perception) and inference based upon the technique evolved by a continuous and unbroken line of learned mon; that no single person would have been able to put together for the first time such a large collection of arguments 2052 (as in the Mimāṁsāśāstra ). For the necessity of Nyaya ( in the interpreta tion of the Veda) he relies upon Manu XII. 105–106. Kumārila ig prepared to concede that philosophical systems in which aro postulated pradhāna and puruṣa (Saṅkhya) or the supremo Lord or atonas (Vaiseṣika) should be deemed to explain the creation and dissolution of the world, should be looked upon as exhibiting perceived, minute and gross substances divided into causes and effects due to the knowledge derived from mantras and arthavādas. The purpose of these is to make known the distinction of svarga and yāga as result and cause. The purpose of the description of creation and dissolution is to show the

distinction between the power of luok and human effort. He goos even a step further and is prepared to admit that even heterodox hypotheses of Bauddhas such as the theory that only Vijñana (cognition) exists, that everything is in an eternal flux and that there is no (permanent) soul, whicb (theories) sprang from the arthavada passages in the Upaniṣads, 'serve the purpose of inducing people to give up extreme attachment to sensual pleasures and are useful and authoritative in their own ways. 

He sums up the distinction by stating that as regards those smrtis (or portions of them) in which the fruit or result promised cannot possibly be experienced in this life, but where the result is promised as fructifying in the remote future (i. o. after death), an inferenco as to their being based on Veda may be drawn, but, as in the case of scorpion lore 2013 (i. e. incantations for curing the sting of a scorpion), works dealing with matters that can be seen are authoritative only because the result can be perceived in other men similarly stung. 

The medieval Dharmaśāstra works take up this discussion about the distinction between smṛtis based upon the Veda and those on perceptible motives or purposes. For example, the Kalpa taru (Brahma-cari-kāṇda p. 30) and Aparārka (pp. 626-627) quote verses from Bhaviṣyapurāṇa (Brāhmaparva chap. 181, 22-31) that divide the contents of smrtis in five categories and exemplify that division. The Sm. C. II. p. 24 quotes two of those and the Paribhāṣāprakāśa of Mitramiśra (p. 19) quotes all of them, Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III, p. 840 note 1634 for all the verses. 

Kumārila (pp. 194–196 of Tantravārtika) holds that the passages quoted by Sabara on 1. 3. 3 are not really opposed to Veda at all and that the proper subject for discussion under I. 3. 3–4 is the authoritativeness in matters of Dharma of the schools 2054 of Saṅkhya, Yoga, Pasupata, Pāñcarātra and Sakyas

and he holds that all these are outside the pale of the three Vedas and are to be disoarded as unauthoritative, although they contain a few mattors such as ahimsa, truthfulness, self-control, charity and compassion, that agree with śrubi and smrti. It will have been seen from the above that Kumārila was aware of the emphasis placed by Buddhists on some moral values but he differed from them in many other matters, that he was ready to admit that Buddhist works had some value and he did not preach that they should be burnt or destroyed. Therefore, it appears that his attitude was far from being one of total hatred and persecution of the Buddhists, as alleged by Taranatha cited above on p. 1010 n. 1645. 

Sabara explains that sutras 5-7 of P. M, S, I. 3 are 2055 concerned with certain religious acts such as ācamana (sipping water) when one Breezes in the midst of 8 rito, the wearing of . Yajõopayita (the sacred thread), the use of the right hand alone in all acts. These interfere with the sequence and quick performance of the subordinate items in a religious rite, says the objector. Sabara establishes that there is no substance in the objection Kumārila feels that Sabara is not right as regards the three instances cited by him. He splits the three sūtras into two adhikaranas (topics for consideration); sūtras 5 and 6 deal (aco, to Kumārila) with the contention that those precepts of Buddha and other founders of unorthodox sects, such as the construction of monasteries and parks, the insistence on desirelessness ( vairāgya), the continuous practice of meditation, ahimsa, truthfulness, restraint of senses, charity and kindness are such as are laid down also by the Veda, are not opposed to the ideas of sistas and cannot rouse the antipathy of those who know the Vedas and that therefore those parts of the unorthodox systems should be deemed to be authoritative. This contention is ropelled by Kumarlla with the remark that only 14 (four Vedas, 6 Vedāógas, Purāṇas, Nyāya, Mimārsā and Dharmaśāstra ) or 18 (adding four Upavedas) have been accepted by the Vedic śiṣṭas as authoritative in matters of Dharma and the works of Bauddhas, and other sects are not included therein. 2056 Kumārila gives & telling example viz. milk, though by itself pure and useful,

becomes useless and unacceptable, when poured into a bag of dog-skin. 

Kumārila holds that sutra 7 of PMS I. 3 is an adhikarana by itself and is concerned with the authoritativeness of sadācāra ( the customs and usages of sistas). His position as elaborated in the Tantravārtika is that those usages alone are authoritative that are not opposed to express Vedic texts, that are practised by śistas under the belief that they are right conduct (dharma) and for which no visible motive ( such as pleasure or the satisfaction of desiros or the acquisition of wealth) can be predicated. Sistas are only those that perform the religious ritos and duties expressly enjoined by the Veda. The practices traditionally handed down from generation to generation that are observed by "sistas (as defined above) with the conviction that they form 

part of Dharma must be regarded as Dharma and as leading to heaven. The Tantravārtika remarks that practices do not become authoritative merely by the fact that no visible motive or purpose can be postulated for them; but they become so only when they are observed by śistas as part of Dharma. 2057 Many activities such as agriculture, service or trade, that are the means of securing wealth and pleasures and such actions 28 eating sumptuous food, drinking, sleeping on soft beds, possoso ing a charming house or garden, all of which are common to Āryas and Mlecchag are not deemed by any one to be part of Dharma and it does not follow that because a few actions of śistas are accepted as Dharma, all their actions are to be looked upon as Dharma. Kumārila quotes the advice that a man should follow the path by which his father, grand-father and other ancestors went, provided it is the path of the good, follow ing which he will not come to harm. 2058 

Very intricate questions arise with regard to the relative force of śruti (Veda), smrti and sadācāra (usages observed by śigtas as defined above and in Manu XII, 109). The Mit. on Yāj. 17 (laying down five sources of Dharma viz. śruti, smrti,

Conflict among source of Dharma 1265 sadācāra, and two more ) states the general rule that in case of conflict each preceding one is more powerful than each suoceed ing one. Manu (I. 12 ) states that, for those who desire to know Dharma, Sruti (Veda) is the highest authority. Therefore, in case of conflict between śruti and smrti the former prevaila There are a fow exceptions oven to this olear rule which may be illustrated later on. But where two smptis are in conflict, the ordinary rule, following the Sodasi-nyāya and the words of Gautama I 5 (Tulyabalavirodhe vikalpah), should be an option. Many works on Dharmaśāstra must have been composed long before 500 B. C., since Gautama mentions Manu (in 21.7) and 'acāryāḥ' (in 3. 35, 4. 18) and Ap. Dh. 8. (I. 6. 19. 2-12) mentions no less than nine individual authors' cpinions on the single question as to whose food may be eaten. Manu ( in IL 16) montions three views held by four sages on the position of a brāhmaṇa who marries a śūdra wife or has a son or child from her. A striking example of a conflict between smrtis is the rule of Manu (III. 13), Baud. Dh. 8. I. 8. %, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 24. 1-4, Vas. I. 25, Pār. Gļ. L. 4 allowing anuloma marriages and permit ting a brāhmaṇa to have a gūdra woman as & wife and the emphatio statement of Yāj. I, 56-57 that it does not agree with those that declare that persons of the three higher classes oan take a śūdra woman as wife. Later writers of smrtis and nibandhas should have said that on account of this conflict there is an option. But they do not say so. They struck upon vari ous devices to wriggle out of such apparent contradictions. The first device was declared by Bphaspati (about 500 A. D.) that the Manusmrti oocupies a pro-eminent position as it correct ly represents the songo (the real view) of the Vedas and that a smrti which is opposed to the teaching of Manu is not held in esteem. 2039 But this was not satisfactory and some other devices wore resorted to. One was to insert passages in Manusmrti itself and in other works opposing what had already been declared as the law. Two examples may be oited. As against Manu III, 13 (referred to immediately above ) we find in the extant text (III. 14–19 ) verses very strongly condemping persons of the three

higher wrnais taking a sūdra woman as wife. Manu allowed the practice of niyoga (in IX. 59-62), but the extant Manusmrti (IX. 64-68) condemns it in no measured terms. These contra.. dictory statements were known to Bṛhaspati who expressly says that Manu permits niyoga and himself forbids 2060 it and assigns & reason viz. that in former ages (Kșta and Tretë) people practised tagay and were endowed with knowledge while in the Dvāpara and Kali ages men have lost the powers possessed by men of the past ages and therefore niyoga is forbidden. Yājñar valkya himself proposes (11. 21) that when two smrtis are in conflict 'Teasoning baged on the practices of elders was of greater force'. Nārada has a similar rule. 2061 Another device was to declare that the nature of Dharma differed in each of the four yugas and that in the krta, tretā, dvāpara and kali ages the Dharmas respectively promulgated by Manu, Gautama, Saṅkha-Likbita and Parāśara were to provail. 2062 įThis also could not solve all difficulties, since medieval commentators and digests found that even what was allowed by Parāśara (such as permitting a brāhmaṇa to eat food at the 2463 house of such sūdras as his dada, cowherd, barber, family friend and & cultiva: tor of his land for a half share of the crops, permission for a married woman to re-marry in certain circumstances), came to be disapproved of or condemned by people. | Another expedient in cases of conflict among smrtis was provided by Gobhila viz. where there is a conflict of ( smrti) passages, the opinion of the majority should prevail. 2067

Long period of ihe composition of smrtis 

1267 

As shown above smrtis had been composed before 500 B. C. and they continued to be compiled till about 900 or 1000 A. D. 1. e. for over 1500 yeara. Yāj. (I. 4-5) mentions 19 smrtia including his own. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. I. pp. 132-135 for the enumeration of different numbers of smṛtis in different works. At least a hundred smrtis if not more can be named. During the long period of over 1500 years vast changes in the religious and social ideas of the Indian people, in their customs and usages had occurred. Buddhism arose, flourished and disappea red from India, the caste system became rigid in the matter of food, marriage and social behaviour; Vedic ritos, divinities worshipped and languagó underwent great transformations, animal sacrifices, though occasionally performed, had ceased to be looked upon as meritorious. The religious literature had therefore to be recast to suit new ideals, new worship and new patrons (viz. the common people who had coased to follow ancient ritual and worship). Smptis reflected the changes in ideas, beliefs, worship and usages that occurred from time to time and naturally gave rise to great conflicts among them selves. At last it appears that the learned men of the 10th and following conturies of the Christian era hit upon the plan of providing that certain customs and practices, though formerly allowed and practised, were harmful in the Kali age. A theory was put forward that great sages came together at the beginning of the Kali age and declared that certain ribes, customs and usagos, though allowed in past ages, should be prohibited in the Kali age. 2065 The actions prohibited or to be avoided in the Kali age (about 55 in number and therefore called Kalivariya) have been set out and discussed at length in H. of Dh: VOL II. pp. 926-967. It is clear from Medhātithi's bhāṣya on Manu (IX. 112) that long before his time (9th century A. D.) there were writers who had condemned govadha (in Madhuparka &o.). niyoga and the giving of a larger share to the eldest son and expressed the view that those practices were only allowed in bygone ages. 

This subject of Kalivarjya requires some serious considera tion. Three of the Kalivarjyas are the prohibition of niyoga, of

the offering of the anubandhya cow (after avabhrtha) in Jyoti stoma and of the allotment of the largest share (of ancestral wealth) to the eldest son. All these three were either enjoined or permitted by the Veda. From Rg. X. 40.2 it follows that & sonless widow raised a son for the sake of the spiritual benefit of her husband's soul by sexual intercourse with the husband's brother. 2066 The Tai. 8. (III. 1. 9. 4) has two contradictory passages viz. 'Manu divided his wealth among his sons' (with out making any distinction among them) and therefore they endow the oldest son with (the paternal) wealth' (Tai. S. II, 5. 2. 7). In this last case it may be argued that as two Vedic passages are in conflict there is an option. But from very early times there is a prohibition against allowing the whole ances tral wealth or a major portion of it to the oldest son. Apastamba quotes both 2057 Vedic passages, holds that equal division among sons is the proper rule and remarks that allowing the eldest son to take the whole or a major portion of ancestral estate is pro hibited by the Sastras. Among actions forbidden in the Kali age but practised in Vedic times some striking ones (apart from the three already cited above) may be mentioned here: (1) being initiated for Sattras (which were sacrifices extending from 1% days to 12 years or even more and which could be performed by brāhmapas alone ); Jaimini 2068 deals with them at some length in 

VI. 6. 16–32 and other places. It is remarkable that neither Sabara nor Kumarila says anything against Sattredikṣā as prohibited in Kali. So it was not among generally recognized Kalivarjyas till at least the 8th century A. D. (2) killing of a cow or bull. There were several occasions on which this was

Some regard this verse as indicating re-marriage and got niyoga. But that does not appear to be correct. Maou (IX. 65) states that niyoga la nowhere mentioned among the mantras relating to marriage nor is the remarriage of a widow referred to in the procedure of marriage. But Gautama and some other sūtrakāras aod even Yaj. (1. 68-69 ) prescribe in detail the procedure and conditions governing oiyoga ; all writers are entirely silent about the procedure of the re-marriage of widows. Therefore, it has to be said that Rg. X. 40. 2 was rightly held by ancient sortis es referriog to the practice of niyoga.

As flesh-eating came to be looked down upon, cow-sacrifices became most abhorrent and medieval Kallvarjya texts only register a prohibition which had been acted upon for centuries before them. (3) The employment of cups of wine in the Sautrāmaṇl sacrifice. 2069 Jaimini, Sabara and the sup-tikā of Kumārila describe it and both Sabara and Kumārila refer to the offering of cups of wine in it. Therefore this rite must have become Kalivarjya after Kumārila's day. (4) Offering an animal with the recital of Vedic mantras to the bridegroom, to a guest and in honour of pitys. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II, pp. 542-546 for Madhuparka in which a bull or a cow was offered according to the Ait. Br. and Vol. II, pp. 945-46 for this Kalivarjya. Manu (V. 41-44) allows the killing of animals in Madhuparka, in sacrifices and in rites for the pitrs (Manes) and gods and emphasizes that sacrificing an animal as laid down by the Veda is no hiñsā but is ahiinsa. Yāj. (1. 258-260) prescribes the periods of time for which pitrs are gratified by the offering of sacrificial food (such as rice or sesame), various kinds of fish and the flesh of several animals. The Mit. Wag 2070 

constrained to observe that, although Yāj. shows that sacrificial food (rice &c), flesh and honey are offerings in Sraddha for all varṇas, yet (in its day) the rule established by Pulastya should be followed viz. food fit for muni (i. e. rice) should be offered by brāhmaṇas, flesh by kṣatriyas and vaisyas and honey by śūdras. 

According to the Pūrvamimāmsā Veda is eternal, self-existent and of absolute authority; one fails to understand how sages could have authority at the beginning of the Kali-yuga to prohibit what the Veda enjoined or permitted. This-geerns to be a fiction invented to accommodate as Dharma the changes in people's ideas and practices that had occurred. It would have been honest and straightforward if the writers on Dharmaśāstra had

said that changed ciroumstances required that the words of the Veda or of the old smṛtis should not be followed. And there is nothing novel or revolutionary in saying this. Both Manu 2071 and Yājāavalkya prescribe that one should not observe but give up, what was (once) deemed to be dharma, if it had become hateful to the people and if it would end in unhappiness and not lead to the attainment of heaven. Even the Mitākṣarā follows this precept of the two smrtis and expressly says that unequal distribution (at partition) of ancestral wealth, though found in the Śāstras, should not be followed because people had come to hate it. It may be noted that the word used by Yāj. and others is 'lokavidvista' or 'lokavikrusta' (hated or reviled by the people) and not sista-ridvista', the idea being that even if orthodox learned pandits insist that people must follow what the Veda and smrtis declare to be Dharma, common people way give up practices condemned by them or hateful to them. This attitude recognizes the historical facts that practices change in the course of centuries and common people are entitled to ignore the diota even of the Veda (much more of the smrtis).

other's sister's daughter if a maternal uncle's daughter can be married, the Smśticandrikā replies' we do not say that she could not be married according to Sāstra, but she should not be married as people abhor such a marriage and it quotes Yāj. I. 156 (by oversight it ascribes the verse to Manu). In modern times when any change or reform in religious or social practices is suggested, Pandits calling themselves Sanātanis put forward the pleas that the proposed change or reform is opposed to the sāstras, that the controversy should be carried on according to the Mimāmsā rules, that all Smṛti and other diota should be so construed as to lead to samanvaya (consistent arrangement of apparently discordant texts), that the historical approach leads nowhere and should not be resorted to. All these objections are hero briefly dealt with. It has been shown how from Vedic times to the present day great changes have taken place in religious ideas, worship and practices, how emptis from Gau tama, Apastamba, Manu downwards espouse conflicting views Bo much so that as early as the Mahabharata Vyāsa 2077 had to protest that 'rationalisation is unstable, Vedas are in con flict with each other, there is no single sage whose opinion is held to be authoritative (by all), the truth about Dharma is enveloped in a cave (i. e. it cannot be clearly discerned) and that therefore the path (to be followed) is the one followed by the great mass of people.' The Mimāmsā does not often lead to certain conclusions and it has already been seen how great Mimāṁsā writers like Sabara, Kumārila, Prabhākara differ among themselves on numerous topics and it would be further illustrated later on how even great Mimāṁsakas evolve highly conflicting conclusions in the interpretation of simple smrti passages. Change is the one absolute in the long history of our religious and social ideas and what those who appeal to the historioal approach mean is that the smftis were composed by human authors during a period of 1500 or 2000 years and were greatly influenced by the then prevailing religious and social atmosphere, that many of their diota cannot be fully reconciled 80 as to form a consistent code of conduct, that they cannot be

It is of course clear that changes in practices and principles should not be made merely for the sake of change or for the whims of some leader, but the gover ning principle of conscious change should be the feelings and needs of common people, while retaining the foundations on which society has been based for thousands of years. 

It has further to be noted that the Mimāmsā rules were concerned only with the interpretation of the Vedic passages on sacrificial rites and matters relating thereto and had very little to do with the practices of people unconnected with sacrifices or religious rites, 2013 The Mimāmsāsūtra nowhere says that the same rules should be applied to the interpretation of smptis. On the contrary, the P. M. 8. is very critical about smṛtis and usages (vide P.M. 8. I. 3. 3-4 and 7). There are fundamental differences between the Veda and the smrtis. The. Voda was deemed to be self-existent, eternal and of absolute authority, while smrtis are pauruṣeya (works of human authors), bave only a derived authority (as being presumed to be based on Vedic passages most of which are not now available), their number is

very large, they often differ so much from each other that even eminent authors and works like the Mitākṣarā had sometimes to give up in despair the idea of bringing order out of the welter of smrti pasaages and in their efforts at samanvaya had to say that certain smrtis refer to a former Kalpa or Yuga (i, e. to & society of several thousands or millions of years ago ). One of the well-known maxims of the P. M. 8. is the one called 'Sarvaśa khāpratyayanyāya '2074 or Sākhāntarādhikarananyaya' (II. 4. 8-33). In the several recensions of the Veda and the Brāhma pas attached to the Vedic recensions the game rite is mentioned and is dilated upon with details some of which occur in one or more recensions but are absent from othera. Jaimini and Sabara establish that all the Sākhās of the Veda and the Brahma nas form one corpus, that such rites as Agnihotra and Jyotiṣ toma are one and the same in all recensions of the Veda. though the details may vary here and there, and this is the proper conclusion because the name (Jyotiṣtoma and the like) is the same in all recensions, the promised roward of the rite is the same, the materials of the sacrifice and the devatā are the same and the codanās (the exhortatory sentences) are the same. This very maxim was extended to smftis from very early times, Vigya rūpa, Medhātithi, the Mitakṣarā, 3075 Apararka and other commentators extend this to smrtis and provide that where smrtis are in conflict there is to be an option but that in other CABOS all the details are to be added up. But as an option was liable to eight faults the tendency developed that all smsti passages on a topic were to be so interpreted as to give no rise to conflict or to allow no option by means of various devices

such as. Visaya-vyavasthā', reference to another Kalpa or Yuga and so on. For example, even as regards the stock example of mkalpa (viz. taking or not taking the Sodasin cup in Attrātra) the Mit. says that it is proper to assume that it should be taken if it is possible to do so, or it may be assumed that by taking the Ṣodasin cup in Atirātra the attainment of scarga is hastened &c. 2076 The result of regarding all smrtis as constituting one Śāstra was that many simple rites became in course of time Overloaded with details, complicated and taxing to the perfor. mer. But sometimes it is necessary to apply this doctrine. For example, Yāj. I. 135 requires the snūtaka not to look at the sun (nekṣetārkam ); this would mean that to look at the sun is prohibited at all times, but the dictum of Yāj. should be read along with Manu IV.37 which forbids a person to look at the rising or setting sun or at the sun when eclipsed or as reflected in water or when it is at the meridian. So the rule will be as stated by Manu. 

While on this subject of the authoritativeness of Smrtis it would be useful to glance at what Jaimini and particularly Kumārila say about the Vedāngas. As regards Siksā (Phone tics ) Kumārila says that the account given in that work about the organs employed in pronunciation and the rules about Vedic accents have their use in the correct recitation of mantras. On the Kalpa-sūtras Jaimini 2077 has a separate adhikarang (I. 3. 11-14). Sabara mentions by name the Māsaka, Hastika and Kaundinyaka Kalpasūtras and the Tantravārtika draws & distinction between kalpa (ritual of Srauta sacrifices ) and Kalpa. sūtras, and refers by name to eight. 

These sūtras (PMS 1. 3. 11-14) have been interpreted by Kumārila in several different ways, firstly as referring to the authoritativeness of Kalpasūtras ( as done by Sabara ), Becondly

The principal distinction is that Kalpas about each vedic sacrifice lay down simply the procedure that is ready made as handed down by oral tradition, while Kalpasūtras like those of Aivalāyana, Baljavāpi, Drāhyāyaṇa, Lāyāyana and Kātyāyana contain sanfras, B guns bhāsās, general rules, exceptions and definitions etc. 

Buddhist works claimed to be smydis

As referring to all the siz Vadangas and thirdly as referring to the 80-oalled smrtia of Buddha and others. That the Buddhist works claimed to be smrtis is clear from the Manusmrti 2078 the smrtis that are beyond the palo of the Veda and whatever other false systems may exist, they are all fruitless as to the (soul's ) Hereafter (destiny after bodily death), since they are all based on tamas (ignorance). Here some words will be said about the Vedāngas according to Kumārila. According to both Sabara and Kumārila, vyakarana is dealt with in Jaimini I. 3.24-29. In the Tantravārtika Kumārila launches an elaborate and telling (pūrvapakṣa) onslaught against Pāṇini himself, aganiet Kātyāyana (the author of the Vārtikas) and Patañjali (author of the Mahābhāṣya) in which some very interesting points are made but they have to be pagsed over for reasons of space. Kumārila says that the proper subject of grammar is to detera mine what words are correct or incorrect. It is intersting to note that in the prima facie attack against grammar two Pūrvamlmāṁsā sūtras are said to offend against grammar. 2079 

The Nirukta of Yaska, which is one of the six angas of the Veda, is an extensive work and deals with the derivation of words, semantics, explanations of several hundred Vedic verses in whole or in part. Jaimini agrees with several conclusions of the Nirakta, which claims that without its help one cannot under stand the meaning of the Veda, that it has a purpose of its own and is a complement of grammar, and it controverts at great length the view of Kautsa 2010 that Vedic mantras have no meaning

Jaimini further 2082 agrees with the Nirukta about the denotation of verbs and noung. Sabara frequently quotes either the very words of the Nirukta or pointedly refers to them. 2053 Jaimini agrees with the Nirukta in the matter of the nature and functions of the Devatās in sacrifices. 2084

tedāngas are comprehended under smrti 1217 Kumarile makes a general remark that all the six angas and the Dharmasastres are comprehended under Smrti, 2005 

It appears that Jaimini did not attach much importance to Smśtis, since out of 915 (or 1000) Adhikarapas barely about a dozen are concerned in any way with smrtis alone, viz. I. 3, 1-2, I. 3,3-4, I. 3. 11-14, I. 3. 24-29, VI. 2. 21-22, VI. 2. 30, VI, 8. 23-24, VII, 1. 10, IX. %. 1-2, XII. 4. 43. Sabara, however, refers to emptis in many more places such as on VI. I. 5 and 13, IX, 1.6-9. 

We are here concerned with the attitude of Jaimini and his early commentators like Sabara and Kumārila towards Smrtis. The established conclusion arrived at by Jaimini (in 1. 3.2) is that in case of conflict with the Veda Smrti is to be discarded, but if there be no confliot (of Smrti with Veda), it may be inferred (that Smrti is based on some Vedic text). 

This amounts to saying that there is always & presumption that smrtis are based on Veda, if their prescriptions are not directly in conflict with the Veda, Sportis proscribe the obser vance of Aṣtakā śrāddhas, the digging of tanke, following and obeying a teacher. These are authoritative because they do not conflict with any Vedic text of opposite import. The Smrtis do claim that they are based on the Veda. Gautama says so (in XI. 19 in note 2042) and Manu states (II. 7) whatever Dharma is proclaimed by Manu for anybody has all been ( already) declared in the Veda, since Veda possesses all knowledge'. 

In connection with smrtis and usages an important question ariges viz, if there is conflict between smrtis and usages of śiṣṭas, which is to be regarded as more authoritative. Kumārila holds that if the practice of good men is not opposed to what is taught in the Veda and Smrti, such practices can be undorstood to be authoritative but if there is contradiction between what is taught by Veda and by Smrti and by usages, then their authori tativeness would be opposed (i. e. would be lost) and further that 1086 smrti is more authoritative because it is based directly

on the Veda, while in the case of usages, one has to infer that śiṣṭas must have based their conduct on some smrti, whioh in its turn has to be deemed to be based on some Vedic text 1. e. usage is removed from the Veda by one step further than Smrtis and besides it is well-known that smstis are compositions by porsons who were deeply versed in the Veda, while the origins of usages are vague and unascertainable.

Though this is the theoretioal rule, supported by Dharma Śāstra works guch as Vas. I. 5, Mit. on Yāj. I. 7 and II. 117, Kullūka on Manu II. 10, one finds that usages opposed to smśtis have been in vogue from ancient times (such as the usage of marrying one's maternal uncle's daughter that is condemned by Manu and authoritative smrtis). The Vyavahāramayūkla (p. 98 of the text in B. G. S.) was constrained to observe that in the Purāṇas one often finds usages opposed to smṛtis. The courts have held that 'immemorial usage is transcendental law' and that this is the translation by Sir William Jones of 'Scāraḥ paramo dharmaḥ' in Madu I. 108. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III. pp 874-876 for two interpretations of this verse of Manu I. 108 in modern times. Manu in (II. 10 ) asserts that Veda and smrti are in all matters not to be subjected to (hostile ) reaso ning, since Dharma shone forth from these two. Manu further provided that as rogards matters not specifically provided for, whatever brāhmaṇas that have studied the Veda together with the supporting lores (viz. the six aigas, mimārsā, Purāṇas &c.) and that make others realize what Sruti gays are sistas and whatever they declare to be the Dharma in such unprovided cases is undoubtedly the Dharma. 

It was declared by the Privy Council that under the Hindu system of law clear proof of usage will outweigh the written text of the law. 2087 From very ancient times customs and usages have been held to be authoritative. For examplo, Gautama XI. 20 says 'the usages of countries, castes and families are authoritative, provided they are not (directly ) opposed to Vedic texts.' Manu I. 118 states that he has embodied in his Śāstra the long-standing customs and usages of coun tries, castos, families, heretical sects and guilds. In some matters

In the examination of certain Kalivarjyas mentioned above, (p. 1268-1270) it has been shown how several actions prohibited in the Kalivarjya texts were practised in Vedic times or were onjoined by Vedic texts. 

Kumārila points out that even brāhmapa women of Ahi. cohatrā and Mathurā drank 2089 liquor in his day, that northern brābmaṇas engage in such transactions as the gift and sale of horses that have a mano, of mules, camels and animals that have two rows of teeth and eat from the same plate with their wives, children and friends, that brāhmaṇas of the South enter into matrimony with the maternal uncle's daughter and take their meals while seated on a couch of wiokorwork, that both (brāhmaṇas of the North and South ) take cooked food (kept in pots) that remains after their friends or relatives have partakon of it or that has been touched by them at the time of eating), that they chew tāmbula of botol leaves, betelnut, catechu and lime made into a roll that has been touched (in a botel-seller's shop) and do not sip water at the end of the chewing, wear clothes cleaned by washermen and brought on the back of asses, that they do not avoid the contact of persons guilty of grave sins except of the murder of a brāhmaṇa; there are also an infinite number of obvious violations of the subtle dictates of Dharma laid down for each man, caste or family, that these transgressions) are contrary to Sruti and Smrti and have a visible purpose and that it is not possible to regard such adulterated practices as Dharma inculcated by sadācāra. The requisites of valid usages according to the Pūrvamlmārsā sohool are that they must be ancient, not opposed to the express texts of the Veda or of Smrti, must be such as are deemed by śistas to be obligatory and must 

2088. For examplo, the Hindu Marriage Act (25 of 1955 ) by section 5 provides that the parties to a marriage must not be within the degrees of prohibited relationship and most not be sapindas of each other and yet adds 'unless the custom or usage governing each of them peraits of a marriage between the two'.

be observed by them with the consciousness that they are sq. they must not havo & visible purpone and must not be immoral, Vide H. of Dh. Vol. III, p. 853-855 for discussion on valid ous toms and usages. 

The general rules laid down by Dharmaśāstra works about the binding character of customs and usages are in line with the rules of the Pūrvamimāmgā. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. IIL pp. 871 884. But deviation from Vedic texts and smṛtis gradually arose 88 noted above. 

Even all actions done by great men cannot be called sadācūru, according to Kumārija, if they can be attributed to greed or some such base motive and should not be looked upon as Dharma. Gautama, 2090 Āp. Dh. S. and the Bhagavata-pura ṇa remark that even great men were guilty of violations of Dharma and defiant excesses, that those great men incurred no sin (got over the effects of such violations) on account of their being endowed with eminent tapas ( spiritual merit due to auster itios) but that others of later ages following their examples and treading the same path would sink (into hell). Kumarila cites twelve such instances of lapses, explains them away or says they were due to wrath of other passions and were not intended by the authors (of those acts) as dharma and are not looked upon as śiṣṭācāra by modern men. The twelve instances are: Praja pati who became enamoured of his own daughter (Uṣas, explains Kumārila), Indra is described as the jāra (paramour) of Abalya (night, according to Kumārila's explanation); Vasiṣtha through grief for the slaughter of his hundred song by a demon contemp lated suicide ; Viśvāmitra who became officiating priest to Trisanku that had become a capdāla through a ourse; Nabusa who, when he occupied the position of Indra, made approaches to Saci, wife of Indra and was transformed into an ajagara (huge reptile); Purūravas, when separated from Urvasi, thought of dying (by hanging &c.); Krṣpa-dvaipāyana who was naiṣthika (perpe tual) brahmacārin raised sons on the widows of his uterine brother, Vicitravlrya; Bhiṣma, though unmarried, performed Asyamedha sacrifices; Dhṛtarāṣtra, though congenitally blind, performed

sacrifices which blind men are not authorised to do (compare Jai. VI. I. 42); five Pāṇdavas marrying one Draupadi; Yudhi. ṣthira who prevaricated and thereby caused the death of Droṇa, his brāhmaṇa guru; Krona and Arjuna are described in the Mahābhārata as drunk with wine ('ubhau madhyāsavakṣibau dṛstau me Keśayārjunau' in Udyogaparva 59. 5) and married their maternal uncle's daughters; Rāma performed Asyamedha by associating a golden image of Bitā with him. 

Kumārila displays great ingenuity in explaining away most of thege transgressions by plausible and specious argu ments, by relying on the great tapas in some cases (such as about Viṣvāmitra) and in some cases by downright denial (as in the case of Subhadrā being the sister of Krona ). 2091 Those interès ted may refer for all these instances and their explanations by Kumārila to H. of Dh. Vol. III, pp. 845-848. 

One interesting adhikarana is the Holākādhikarana (Jai. I. 3. 15-23). It is said that Holākā should be observed by the easterners, Anninaibuka by Southernors, Udyrsabhayajña by northerners. The established conclusion is that such observancos are meant for all (and not merely for persons of the East or South &c.), if they are fit to be done by 2092 easternors or souther ners (there is no reason why these should not be observances fit for all). The general rule about Vedic vidhis is that they are applicable to all Aryas; no cogent reason exists why a restrioted Vedic text should be inferred in the case of the above observa. ncas. Vide H. of Dh. VOL III. pp. 851-853 for detailed explana tion of this maxim and above pp. 237 ff. The Dāyabhāga ( II. 40 and VI, 22-23) refers to this maxim in connection with a double share to be allotted to the acquirer and with reference to a person acquiring property without detriment to the ancestral estate and explains the purpose of the Holākādhikaraṇa. 

The Holākādhikarspanyāya is frequently mentioned by writers on Dharmaśāstra. Viśvarūpa on Yaj. I. 53 quotes the

This is a sample of what to expect from some orthodox Sangkrit writers, when bard pressed by facts contrary to their pat theories or vlews,

siddhāntasutra 'api va sarvadharmaḥ gyāt tannyayatvid vidhānagya' (Jai. I. 3. 16 ) and adds that it must be regarded as 'Sarvadbarma'(as applicable to all) if it is recommended as som thing to be observed by some people. There is a difference of opinion between medieval writers on Dharmaśāstra as to the exact import of this adhikarana. The Dayabhāga says 2093 that tho Sruti to be inferred from the practice of Holākā by easterners is simply the general one (sāmābya-śruti) that Holaka rites should be observed. On the other hand Govindananda in his Com. on the Prayascitta-viveks of Sūlapāṇi says that the Holakādhikarana leads to this only that the Sruti to be inferred from this practice is not in the form the easterners should por form Holāki' but it is in a general form viz. 'the usage of a country should be observed by those in the country'.
