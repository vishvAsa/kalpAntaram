CHAPTER XXVII Nyāsas, Mudrās, Yantra, Cakra, Mandala, etc. 

One of the important items in the Tantrik ritual and worship is nyūza, which means mentally invoking a god or gods, mantras and holy texts to come to occupy certain parts of the body in order to render the body a pure and fit receptacle for worship and meditation'. Soveral works such as the Jayākhya-samhitā (Patala XI), Prapancasāra (VI), Kulārṇava (IV. 18 ff) refer to several kinds of nyāga; the Saradātilaka (IV. 29-41, V. 5-7), Mahānirvāpatantra (III, 41-43, V. 113-118) describe several varieties of ayāsa. Rāghavabhatta on Śārada tilaka (IV. 29-41) cites numerous quotations on nyāsa from an extensive literature. There are several kinds of pyāsa such 1828 as Hamsanyāsa, Prapavanyāsa, Mātṛkanyisa, Mantranyāsa, Karagyāsa, Anganyāsa, Pithanyāsa. Pranavanyaga is illustrated as 'om ām Brahmane namah', 'om ām Viṣnavo namaḥ' and 80 on for all the names set out by Raghavabhatta on sāradātilaka 25. 58, The Adganyasa (nyāsa on parts of the body) is illustrated as follows: om bṭdayāya namaḥ, om sirase svābi, sikhāyai vaṣat, om kavacıya hum, om netratrayāya (or netradvayāya) vaṣat, om astrāya phat'. Several Purāṇas contain provisions about nyasa. The Garuḍapurāṇa (I. chapters 26, 31, 32) describes anganyāsa as part of worship, japa and homa The Nāradiyapurāṇa (II. 57. 13-14), the Bhāgavata (VI. 8, about 40 verses ), Brahma (60. 35-40 ) provide for nyāsa of the mantras 'om naino Nārāyaṇāya', and 'om Viṣnaye namaḥ' The Kalikāpurāpa (chap. 77) deals with Mātýkānyāsa. The Smrtimuktāphala (Ahnika pp. 329-331) quotes several passages dealing with nyāsa of the 24 letters of the Gāyatri (Rg. III, 62.10 ) on several parts of the body, meditation on each of the 24 letters as having certain colours of flowers and as identical with certain gods and avatāras and nyāsa of the Gāyatripādas on limbs. The Brahmapurāṇa

Padus to ( VI. 79, 17-30) describes the nyāsa of the names of Vishu on the limbs of the body from the head to the foot and Padma VI. 83. 26 speaks of Anganyāds and Karanyasa with the mantra 'om namo bhagavate Vasudevaya'. [The Mateyapranam provides for the employment in pyāsā of mantras withom prefixed to them. Karanganyāss and Anganyāsa of Gayatet are dealt with in Devibhagavata xI. 16. 76-91 and it ar pressly names nyāsa as part of sandhyā worship. 1831 Vide also Devibhagavata XI.7.26-38 for nyasa and Kalikapurapa 53.36. The Devibhagavata (VII, 40. 6-8) mentions the nyāga of oartain letters on such parts of the body as the chost, the space between the eyebrows, the head. The Brhad-yogiyajnavalkyasn contained

The latter work (Sm. O, L p. 145) also contains Anganyāsa of several portions of Gayatri, the nyāse of the single letters of the Gayatri on the limbe and Aparārka (p. 140 ) quotes & passage for the employ mant of the sixteen verses of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90) for Ayasa on the several limbs in the worship of Viṣṇu. For the pyare of the letters of the alphabet from 'a' to'kṣa', vide sazadetilaka V. 5-8 and Raghavabhatta on V. 4 who quotes verses getting out how each letter is to be meditated upon. The Mahanirvana ( V. 176-178 ) also specifies the limbs on which there is to be ayaga of the letters of the alphabet from the forehead downwards. 

The above passages show that the item of nyasa was taken over from Tantrika works in the Parāgas for the rites of the orthodox people several conturies before Yogayājöavalkya, Apariska (first half of 12th century A. D.) and the Smrti candrika. The Varsakriyakaumudi 1823 ( about first half of 16th century) shows that long before it the Garuḍa and the Kālika puranas contained provisions on nyaste The Dovapratisthā tattya of Raghunandana (p. 505) speaks of Matrkānyāsa and Tattvanyaan The Pūjāprakasa section of the Viramitrodaya dwells upon Matṛkānyāsa, Anganyāsa, Gayatrinyāsa on pp. 130, 131, 132 rospectively. The Bhaktiprakasa (pp. 88-89) of the same work deals with Mātrkānyāsa. In modern times some orthodox people still perform two kinds of nyl8as as follows: The Antarmātrks which consists in the mystia assignment (mentally ) of the letters of the alphabet (fron 'a' to kṣa') on the fingers of the hands and on the palm and back of the bands and on several parts of the body viz. the throat, orgads of geno ration, the adhāra place and the middle of the eyebrow (as the Bests of the six psychic cakras mentioned in note 1715 above ). The Bahirmātśkānyiga consists in assigning the individual alphabet letters with anusvāra on each on the limbs from head to feet in such forms as 'ām damaḥ mūrdhni' and so on.

Mudri is another characteristic item in Tantrik ritual The word mudrā kas several meanings, four of whioh have . bearing on Pantrik practices. It means & posture in yogio practices in which the whole body plays a part It also meana that symbolic or mystic intertwining of the fingers and handa as part of religious worship. Mudra is also the 4th of the five makes and means various kinds of grains mired with ghee or other Ingredient (vide note 1752 above) or parched grains. A fourth meaning of modrā is the woman with whom & Tantrik yogi apo ciates himself (as in Prajpopaya o V. 24 and Sakoddadatik p. 56) The Kularnava derives the word from mand' meaning' dalight or 'pleassure' and drāvay' (causal of dru') and says 'mudras (ritual finger and hand poses) should be shown ( in worship) and are so known because they give delight to the gods and make thefr minds melt (with compassion for the worshipper).

give ) and according to it mudra means 'what affords pleasure to the Goda'. Other derivations are also proposed (vide J. O. R. Baroda, vol. VI. p. 13). Raghavabhatta states that the fingers from the thumb to the small ingor are identified with the five alements vis. Skasa ( aky or other), wind, fire, water and earth and that their contact with each other tends to make the deity favourable and delighted and induces the deity to be present at the worship, and that various appropriate mudrās are to be employed in worship, at the time of japa, in meditation and in all rites performed for securing some desired object or benefit, since they induos the deity to be prosent (near the worslip per 1837). It was supposed that mudras helped in enhancing concentration on the part of the worshippor. Even as early as the 7th century it was believed that the making of mudrās may bring to life one who, being poisoned had fallen into coma, as the Kādambari quoted below shows. The Varsakriya kanmudi quotes & verbe saying that japa, prānāyāma, worship of gode, yoga, meditation and asanas are fruitless unless accompanied by appropriate mudrās. 

The word mudrā ocours in the name of Lopamudra, 1838 wife of Agastya, who figures in a hymn of the Rg. (I. 179.4). The word 'mndra' is not mentioned in the Amarakosa.

The H. of Dh. Yol. II. (pp. 320-321 ) makes a brief mention of mandras in worship and refers to the work of Mlae Tyra de Kleen on the mudris practised by Bauddha and Śaiva priests called pedandus in the island of Bali. Here the same subject will be dealt with in a little more detail and from different 

points of view. 

There is a great divergence among the Tantra, Purana and Yoga works on the number, names and definitions of mudrās. This may be briefly illustrated. 

In the Tantrik texts (Vol. I. pp. 46-47) there is a nighanta (a glossary or enumeration) of mudrās with names and defini. tions, where it is stated that nine mudrās (āvāhani and others) are common (1. a. capable of being employed in any worship): and then are enumerated mudrās specially appropriate to Viṣṇu worship (19 in all viz. Saṅkha, Cakra, Gadā, Padma, Vemo, Śrlvataa, Kaustubha, Vanamālā, Jñana, Vidya, Garuḍa, Nara simhi, Varāhi, Hayagrivi, Dhanus, Bāṇa, Paraśu, Jagan-mohini, Vāma; ten of Śiva (Linga, Yoni, Trisala, Aksamala, Abhiti i.o. abhaya, Mrga, Asikā, Khatvānga (& olub with & skull at the top), Kapala, Damaru; one of the Sun (viz. Padma); seven of Ganesa (Danta, Paśa, Ankusa, Avighna, Paśu, Ladduka, Bijapūra ( i. e. a oitron ) 189 

The Sārādatilaka (23. 106-114) names only nine nudras and defines them, while the Viṣpusambitā (VII) says that mudrās are innumerable (verso 45), names about thirty and defines them and Jõānārṇava (IV ), mentions at least nineteen, The Jayakhyagamhita ( 8th Patala ) has about 58 mudrās. The Tantrik 1840 works provide that mudrās should be praotised 

1839. These Modrās are also mentioned in a work called Mudra laksana (D.C. M8. 291 of 1887-91). Some of these mudrās in connection, with the worship of individual goda ocenr in Vippusambitā VII and in Jõānārpava IV. The Madrānighanta games and defines mudrās of Sakti, Agai, Triporā and other deities. The madras specially appropriate in the worship of Viṣgu, such as Saakba, Cakra, Gadā, Padma, Kaustubha, Srivatsa, Vanamalā, Vena are described in & work called Naradatantra quoted by Varrakriyakaumudi pp. 154-156.

The Kāmakalāvilaga of Pupyānanda expre saly mentions ( in Forde 46) Trikhanda-mudra and refers to the fact that there are nine mudria, tai The Nityagodasikārnava (3rdvisrāms) first defines Trikhanda, then names and defines nine mudrās most of which bear names difforent from those in the Sāradatllaka. The Mudras mentioned by Nity &ṣodasika apart from Trikhanda, are: Sarvasaiksobhakarial, Sarvaridravint, Akarṣini, Sarvivegakarl, Unmadini, Mahaakuba, Khecari, Bijamudra, Yonimudra. 

The Jhanarnava Tantra (IV. 31-47 and 51-56 and xv.47 68) names over thirty mudras, several of which bear the sanno name as those in Nityaṣodaśikārṅava, are defined in a similar way and are quoted by Bhāskararaya in his commentary on the latter work. In these circumstances the author proposes to name and describe first of all the nine mudrās of the Saradatilake. 1842 (1) Avahani mudra consists in folding both hands in a hollow and filling the hollow completely with flowers; (2) sthapanl is the same as āvāhanl but the folded bands are held upride down; (3) the sannidhāpana-mudra' occurs when the two hands are formed into a closed fist, are joined together with only the

It may be noted that the marine (IV, 32-37) Dames and describes eight of these nide madras almost in the same words, omitting en voft and calling the महासमा शारदा by the name परमीकरण. The कुलार्णव (17.90-93) has eight out of these nive, omitting संमुखीकरणी and employing the words परमीकरण for महाहवा. Both कुलार्णव and शारदा connect अस्तीकरण with बेहसमा.

Some of the works on Yoga describe various mudras. For example, the Hathayogapradipikā (III. 6-23) describes at length ten mudrās and the Gherandagamhitā (III, 1-3) speaks of 25 mudrās and describes them in one hundred verses. The Śivasanahita (IV. 15–31 ) mentions ten mudrās as the best. An Important mudrā in Hathayoga practices is the Kheoarlmudra described in Dovibhagavata XI.86.62-65, sivasamhita IV. 31-33, Gherandasambita III. 25-27, Hathayogapradipikā II. 32-53, This description differs from the definition of Khecari in Jñānārnava (15. 61-63) and Nityaṣodaśikārṇava II. 15-83. The Vajrolimudri ( in Hathayogapradipikā. III. 82-96) cannot be set out here for reasons of decency and it was supposed to pro long the life of a yogin even after indulgence in sexual orgies. 

Some of the Puranas contain an extensive treatment of mudrās. The Kallkāpurāṇa mentions anganyāsa, karanyāsa in obap. 66 and mudrās like Dhenumudra, Yonimudra, Mahamudrā, Khesarimudra in 70. 36-56, 78. 3-6; Devibhagavata (XI. 16. 98-102 ) speaks of 24 mudrās at the time of Gayatri-japa; the Brahmapurāpa1858 and Naradiyapurāṇa set out eight mudrās

of Viṣpu worahip. Vide Agaipurāṇa, ahap. 26, for a brief reference in 7 verses to some mudris. The Kalikapurapa (70.32) atates that there are 108 mudrās, 55 for general worship and 53 on speoial occasions, such as oollooting materiala, drama, soting (natana) 

Most verses of the Brahmaṇḍaparana (in the Lalitopa. khyāns, chap. 42) are the same as in the Mudrānighandu pp. 55-57 versas 110-118; but the largest number of pudrās in dancing is contained in the Viṣğudhartottara (UI). In chap. 32 it speaks of numerous rabasya (secret) mudrās in prose called mudrahastas and in chap. 33 (1-124) it desoribes over ons hundred sāmānyamudrās and the colophon at the end of the Chapter calls them 'nśttasāatramudrās' (mudrās in the science of dramaturgy ) 184! This opens up & subject which cannot be gone into here, viz. whether the mystic hand poses (mudrāo) in worship were derived from the postures (karanas), recakas (gestures) and 32 angahāras (movements of limbs ) described in the Natyaśāstra 145 of Bharata (chapters 4, 8 and 9). It may be noted that the Nātyaśāstra (in IV. 171 and 173 ) speaks of \#nrtta hastas'. Pāpiui know natasūtras of Silalin and Kpgāsva 1846 Bharata speaks of four kinds of acting (abhinaya 8. 9-10) viz. añgika, vācika, āhārya, sad sāttviks. In the 9th chapter the movements of the hands and fingers intertwined or joined are set out. Muṣti is defined by Bharata in 9. 55. Mudrās would fall under högika abhinaya; angahāras depended upon karanas

and the latter consisted of different arrangements of hands and fast. It is likely that the mudras in the Hindu and Buddhist Tantrik works are based on the poses that were evolved in anotent Indian dance and drama and that find their earliest extant description in Bharata-bātyaśāstra and that are also to be found in later medieval works on dramaturgy such as the Abbinayadarpaṇa.1847 

The Aryamañjusrimūlakalpa names and defines 108 mudrās (p. 380). On p. 376 it states that the combination of mudras and mantrag would bring success in all actions and neithor tithi, nor nakṣatra nor fasting would be required. In the Viṣṇu dharmottarapurāṇa 1848 there is a fine eulogy of the mudrās made in dancing viz. they are the graces of the rich, the removers of the sorrow of the distressed, the instruction of the ignorant, the increase of the blessedness (or charm ) of women; they were created by Vāsudeva for the removal of portonts, as the means of prosperity and of the attainment of desired objects. 

The Buddhists also had mudrās. One of the early works of the Mahāyāna school viz. Aryamañjustimūlakalpa is full of mudrās in the 35th patala (pp. 355-381) and states (on p. 380) that there are 108 mudrās. 1849 L. H. Waddell in the Buddhism of Tibet or Lamaism' (London, 1895) describes nine mudrās practised in Tibet by the Lamas (pp. 336-337). 

In the Indian Antiquery, yol 26 (1897), pp. 24-25, Burgess mentions nine Buddhist mudrās (slightly differing from Waddell's descriptions) as follows:-(1) Bhūmisprs or Bhūmi sparsa mudrā, an attitude of Sākya Buddha ('making the earth as witness ); (2) Dharmaoakra mudrā (teaching attitude); (3) Abhaya mudrā (of blessing), in which the left hand is open

on the lap, the right hand is raised in front of the chest with the fingers and thumb half extended and with the palm faoing forwards; (4) Jõānamudrā (Dhyāna mudra ?) or Padmāsana mudrā (posture of contemplation); (5) the Vara or Varadamudra, in which the right hand hanga down over the knee, the palm of the hand turned outwards symbolising charity; (6) Lalita. mudrā (enchanting or bewitching ); (7) Tarkamudrā (right hand raised to the chest and slightly constricted; (8) Sarapa mudrā (of refuge or protection); (9) Uttarabodhimudrā (pose of highest perfection, which is apt to be confounded with Dharmacakramudrā). 

The Jainas also had mudrās. In J. O. I. (Baroda), vol. VI. No. 1 pp, 1-35 Dr. Priyabala Shah contributes an interesting paper on two Jaina works, one of which called Mudrāvicāra describes 73 mudrās and the other called Mudrāvidhi lists 114 mudrās. 

In a recent work 'Royal conquests and cultural migrations' Mr. C. Śivaramamurti (Calcutta, 1955) remarks (on p. 43) that the 'hastas' and 'karanas' on the Gopura at Chidambaram are found also in the Śiva temple at Prambanan in Jaya, where one can observe many of the huranas like Patākā, Tripatāka, Ardhacandra, Sikhara, Kartarlmukha, Sūci and hastas like Añjali, Puspaputa. In another recent work 'Contributions to the History of the Indian Drama' by Dr. Manomohan Ghosh (Calcutta, 1958) it is stated that in the bas-reliefs of Bayon (Angkor Thom ) certain aspects of the Cambodian dance and drama, particularly certain gestures depicted and actually observed in practice now in the dances in the royal palace, are similar to those described in the Nātyaśāstra of Bharata such as Añjali, Patākā, Ardhacandra, Musti, Candrakalā and Kapota (p. 63). 

Some Sanskrit medieval Dharmaśāstra works from the 13th century A. D. dilate at some length on mudrās. Homādri on Vrata (vol. I. pp. 246-247) speaks of mudrās called Mukula, Pankaja, Niṣthura and Vyoma. The Smṛticandrikā (1st half of 13th century A.D.) names and defines 24.mudrās (I. pp. 146–147). The names are the same as in Devibhāgavata XI. 16. 98-10%. The Pūjāprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaja) defines in all 32 mudrās of which eight, viz. Ārāhani, Sthāpani, Sannidhāpani, Sarnrodhini, Prasāda, Avagunthana, Sammukha, Prarthana are common to the worship of all gods, some are specially appropriate

in Viṣṇu worship, come in worship of the Sun, Lakṣmi and Durgā and the Aõjali and Sambāra mudrās ( the last two) used in the worship of all goda. The Āhnikaprakasa (part of Viramitrodaya) names 24 mudrās to be shown at the time of the japa of Gayatri (pp. 298–299 ) which are the same as in Davi bhāgayata XI. 16. 98-102, but it quotes them as from Brahmā. 1850 It is diffioult to say what work is meant by Brahmā. Mudrās were not universally praotised. It is clear from the Dharmasindhu and Samskāra-ratnamālā quoted in note 1831 that Nyāsa and Mudrā were held to be non-vedic in Mahārāṣtra at least. 

Another item in the Tantrik worship is that of Mandala which has been algo a prominent feature of orthodox Hindu practices in medieval and modern times. But it cannot be said that the concept of mandalas was borrowed by Sanskrit writers from the Tantrikas. The word was used in the sense of orb or circle. In the Tai. S. V. 3.9. 2 reference is made to circular bricks (mandalestakā); vide also Sat. Br. IV. I. 1. 25. The orb of the Sun is also called the wheel (cakra) in Rg. IV, 28.% and V. 29. 10. The Br. Up. says this Āditya is what is (called) truth 1851 (satya)' and refers to the Person in the orb (mandala) of the sun. Then it came to mean any figure or diagram (generally

circular) drawn on an altar and the like. In the Sulbasūtras of Åpastamba and Katyayana reference is made to the squaring of a circle (mandala).1952 The Matsyapurāṇa refers in several passages to mandalas drawn with powders of five colours (as in 58. 22). It also refers to the figure of a lotus of twelve or eight patals drawn with saffron or red sandalwood paste or with various colours (72. 30; 62. 15; 64. 12–13; 74. 6-9 a lotus figure with eight patals and pericarp for sun worship). Varābamihira in Bṛ. 8. (chap. 47) describes 1853 a very auspicious ceremony called Pusy aspāna in which a mandala was to be drawn on holy ground with powders of different colours in which positions were to be assigned to gods, planets, stars etc. The Brahmapurāṇa ( 28, 28 ) mentions the invocation of the Sun on the figure of a lotus and Brahmapurāpa ( 61. 1-3) about the worship of Nārāyana on a mandala in the form of a lotus is quoted by Raghunadana in Puruṣottama-tattva (p. 569). The Harṣacarita 1854 (first half of 7th century A. D.) refers to a large mandala being drawn in several colours. The Varāhapurāṇa refers to the images or paintings of Lakṣmi and Nārāyana in a mandala for worship (chap. 99. 9-11). The Agnipurāṇa (chapter 320 ) refers to eight mandalas, Sarvatobhadra and others. Several mandalas are described in Sāradātilaka III. 113–118, 131-134, 135-139 (davanabhamandala ), in Jñānārṇava 26. 15-17 and other works. According to the Amarakośa 1855 Sarvatobhadra is a variety of

residence for kings or rich people. The Sāradatilaka (III. 106 130 ) deals at length with the construction of a Sarvatobhadra mapdala and remarks that it is common to all worship 1856 and provides (III. 122–124) that the mandala should be drawn with five coloured powders viz. yellow with turmeric powder, white produced from husked grains of rice, red with Kusumbha powder, black with the fine powder of half burnt inferior cereals sprinkled with milk and greenish with powder of the leaves of bilva. The Prapancasāra (V. 64-65) and Agni (30. 19-20) provide for similar coloured powders. The Vāstuyāgatattva of Raghunandana (p. 416 ) quotes the Sāradātilaka (III. 123-124) about the five powders. The Jõānārnavatantra ( 24. 8-10 and 26. 15-17 ) appears to hold that mandala and cakra are synonyms and states that a mandala with nine angles may be drawn on an altar in a pavilion (mapdapa ) with saffron or vermilion powder, 1857 The Mahānirvāṇatantra also refers to mandalas drawn with coloured powders (X. 137–138). Four characteristics of mandala ceremonies are mandala, mantra, pūjā and mudrā. 

The Buddhist tantras also make much of mandalas. In the Manjusrimūlakalpa mandalas are described with special direc tions for painting them. The Guhyasamājatantra speaks of a mandala of 16 cubits with a cakra inside. Vide Prof. G. Tucci's 'Indo-Tibetica' vol. IV part I (Rome, 1941) which gives tables containing mandalas and A. Getty's 'The Gods of Northern Buddhism' (1908) Plate XVI for a mandala of nine elements, and Contributions to the study of mandala and mudra' by Erik Haarh pp. 57-91 of vol XXIII, Nos. 1 and 2 (1958) of Acta Orientalia of the Oriental Societies of Denmark, Norway &c. in which at the end there are photographs of about 100 hand poses (mudrās). The Niṣpannayogāvali (G, O.S.) of Abhayākara gupta, & contemporary of Rāmapāla, king of Bengal ( 1084-1130 A. D.), describes 26 mandalas in 26 chapters, each mandala having a central deity and other minor Buddhist divinities, sometimes more than one hundred in number, 1858

Another characteristio item in Tantrik worship is 'yantra' (geometrical diagram ), sometimes called cakra also, which one finds to some extent also in the Puranas and slightly in modern orthodox practices. A yantra is a diagram (or figure ) engraved, drawn or painted on metal, stone, paper or other material. It resembles a mandala but differs from it in this that & mandala may be employed in the worship of any demtā, while a yantra is specially appropriated to the worship of a particular deity or employed for a particular purpose. The Kulārnava-tantra 1860 states; 'Yantra is a development (or product) of mantra and a deity apprehended in the form of a mantra ; the deity worshipped on the yantra immediately becomes favourable; yantra is so called because it removes all pains (or perturbations) arising from such faults as love and anger; if God is worshipped in yantras, he is pleased'. The same Tantra further says if worship is done without a yantra the devata is not pleased', Here the word 'yantra' is derived from the root 'yantr'. In another place the same tantra states 'Yantra is so deolarad because it always saves (the worshipper) from Yama (god of death) and goblins and other dangers'. The Rāmapūrvatāpaniya Upanisad 1861 observes the arrangement (or preparation) of a yantra is the body of the deity which confers safety'. The Kaulivalinirṇaya observes 'worship (of a deity) without employ ing & yantra, satiating the goddess) without offering flesh, drinking wine without being accompanied by a Sakti (the wife or other woman associated with a Sakta worabipper )-all these yield no fruit.' Some works evolved a 'yantra-gāyatri' also. 1867

These passages make it clear that a yantra was deemed to be a factor belping in restraining the restless movements of the mind due to anger, love and the like and in making the mind concentrate on a diagram or model deemed to represent the deity worshipped. It induced concentration and encouraged the mental realization of the deity. The distinction between the dercyū and yantra is similar to that between the soul and the body. Most Hindus look upon such forms of worship without antipathy because it is felt that they serve as a way of approach to divinity for ordinary unsophisticated people and that it is better to have one's foot on the lowest rung of the ladder to higher life than to bave it on no rung at all. 

Yantras are described in such Tantrik and other works as Tripurātāpani Upariṣad (II. 3), Prapancasāratantra (patalas 21 and 34), Sāradātilaka (VII. 53-63, XXIV), Kamakalāvilāsa (verses 22, 26, 29, 30, 33), Nityāsodaśikārnava (I. 31-43) Nityotsava (pp. 6,64-5), Tantra-rājatantra (II. 44-51, VIII, 30 ff. XXXIII), Ahirbudhnyasamhita (chap. 23-26), Mantramaho dadhi (20th Taranga), Kaulajñānanirṇaya (X, which speaks of them as cakras), Kaulāvalīnirṇaya (III. 105–135), Merutantra (33rd prakāśa, 562 vorses), Mantramahārnava-tantra (Uttard khanda, 11th taranga). It is not possible to deal with all this large material here. The Padma (Pātālakhanda, 79. 1) provides that the worship of Hari (Vispu) may be performed on the Salagrāma stone or on a jewel or a yantra, a mandala, or images, and not merely in a temple. The Ahirbudhnya-sambitā (chap. 36, verses 5-66) describes the procedure of the worship of a Sudarsana-yantra by a king or other personage desiring wealth or prosperity. One yantra or cakra may be explained and illustrated here. The most noted is óricakra described in two verses quoted 1853 below and explained in some detail in the

Setubandha commentary on Nityāṣodaśikārṅava (I. 31-46), The latter verses explain how the Cakra is to be drawn with the bindu in a small triangle. The bindu represents Sakti or Mūla praksti solidified. In published works on Tantra the śricakra is represented in colours ( as in Saundaryalahari published by Ganesh & Co. Madras, 1957, facing the title page ), while others represent it only by means of plain uncoloured lines (as on the outer cover of the above edition of Saundaryalahari or on the cover of the Kāmakalāvilāsa od. by A. Avalon and published by Ganesh and Co. 1953). In some works the figure of Srioakra shows no gates as on the cover in 'Principles of Tantra' by A. Avalop or on the cover of Kāmakalāvilāsa, while gates are shown in other works ( as in the above edition of Saundaryala hari before the Sanskrit text). There are nine triangles, five of whioh have their apex pointing downwards and those represent Śakti and four (representing Śiva) have an apex pointing up wards. The bindu is situated in the smallest triangle pointing downwards. Then there are two pairs of ten triangles ( shown in some books as blue and red respectively), then fourteen triangles (coloured blue in some works), then eight-petalled lotus (sometimes coloured red), 16 petalled lotus ( coloured blue), then three circles, then three boundary lines with four gates, these two latter being the outer sections of the yantra and the lotuses of 8 and 16 petals being the inner section of the yantra. There are in all 43 angles (some works make 44). The part of the Cakra within the boundary lines is called bhūpura. The worship of yantra is bahiryāga (outer or external worship of Śakti). The internal worship (antaryāga) consists in taking the awakened Kundalini through the cakras from Mūlādhāra to Ajmkoakra and then uniting it with the Lord Śiva in the Saham Srāra-oakra, the six cakras from Mūlādhāra being identified with

For example, in D. C. me. No. 962 of 1884–1887 called Fires, five cakras employed in the worship of Durgā according to Kaulāgama are raras, HETE, 9 , am and T (Cat. vol. XVI. on Tantra p. 163 ), while in another ms. D, C. No 964 of 1887-91, several other cakras are described such as STATT, orange, trann, 7 (Cat. vol. XVI. OR Tantra p. 251).

the five elements and mind. This la described in Saundaryala. hari (verse 9). To what lengths 'Sakti' worshippers had gone in the worship of Devi by the bahiryāga method would be clear from a passage quoted from the commentary of Lakṣmidbara, almost the latest among the numerous commentators of the Saundaryalahari, who was horrified by the methoda of Kaulikas. 1864 

The Setubandha on Nityāṣodaśikārnava is at great pains to emphasize that the worship of Tripurasundari is of the nature of upāsanā and not of the nature of bhakti and that this upāsanā is of two sorts, one consisting of the recitation of the mantra of the Devi and the other consisting of the worship of the yantra1865 (or cakra). Verses 126-204 of the Nityasodasi kārṇava detail the different items in the worship of the Sricakran The Nityaṣodaśikā and other Tantrik works say that the great Tripurasundari is seated in the Sricakra,1866 The great aim of the Sākta sādhaka is apparently to realize his identity with the yantra, the mantra, the guru and Tripurādevi. The Varṣakriya kaumudi quotes a verse stating that worship of yantra performed with all mantras is commended and by 80 doing a worshipper 

may secure whatever he desires.1867 

Even a comparatively sober work like the Sāradātilaka provides for the drawing up of yantras for wicked purposes. For example, in VII. 58-59 it describes an Agneya-yantra to be drawn on a garment secured from a pile in a cemetery and buried near the house of one's enemy for the latter's destruction.

In XXIV. 17–18 and 19-21 two yantras for the destruction of an enemy are described. Vide above p. 1105 for Prapancasāra (34. 33 ) providing a yantra for creating passion in a woman and making her run to the person practising magic. 

The Tantrarajatantra provides ( 8th Patala, verses 30-32 ) that yantras that yield all desired objects should be engraved, painted or drawn on pieces of gold, silver or copper or on cloth or birch leaf with paste of sandalwood, agalochum, camphor, musk or saffron and should be worn on the head or the arms or neck, waist or wrist or one shoull worship them after placing them somewhere on the ground &c.); vide also Prapancasāra tantra XI. 46 for similar provisions. 

At the end of this chapter on Tāntrik doctrines and practices reference must be made to a remarkable circumstance. The Sarvadarsanasamgraha of Sāyana-Mādhava (14th century A.D.), that deals with 15 Darsanas (points of view or philosophical views), has not a word to say about Tantras, though it devotes considerable space to the atheistic Cārvāka-darsana and the unorthodox Bauddha and Jaina systems. It is impossible to believe that the most learned brothers Sayapa and Madhava wore unaware of the works on Tantra. The silence must be due to some special reason. If one may make a conjectura, it appears that Tantrik doctrines were discarded for the same reasons that induced the Bengal king Balialasena in his Dānasāgara to exclude the Devīpurāṇa from the authorities on which he meant to rely. At the time when Sayapa and Madhava flourished (about middle of 14th century A. D.) Tantrik doctrines and practices had come into great disrepute. Therefore, Tantrik doctrines were probably passed over in silence by Siyapa Madba ya..

D. and that Advayavara sangraha and Sekoddeśatika borrow from Hevajra-tantra, Sadhanamālā No. 229 (two opening verses) are the same as Havajra II. 8. 6–7. Hovajra is an invocation of vajra. On p. 11 part I the editor questions how the yoging could call themselves Buddhists when they experienced enlightenment in the embrace of a yogini. Part I p. 70 mentions Jālandbara, Oddiyana, Paurṇagiri as pithas and several upapīthas, upa kṣetras. The term Sakti does not ocour in Hevajra but its place is taken by Prajñā. Part II verses 11-15 p. 98 express how the followers of this tantra had sexual experi enoos with women called mudrās and how thereby they secured siddhi. Part I p. 54 contains ritual for gaining mastery over a young woman. Part II p. 2 states 'Heka roṇa mahākarupā vajram Prajñā ca bhanyate; Prajñopāyat makam tantram tan-me nigaditam srupu'. This is a very valuable addition to the literature on Tantra and has been very well edited.

* Lights on the Tantra' by M. P. Pandit (published by Ganesh 

& Co., Madras, 1957) This is a booklet of 54 pages of text and pp. 55-71 of notes containing hardly anything valuable of the author's own; over three-fourths of it consists of long quotations from the works of Woodroffe (particularly from Shakti and Sbākta '), Sri Aurobindo and Shri Kapali Sastry and is here and there marked by bold and unwar Tanted assertions such as 'It is the central truths of the Tantra thought and ritual that form the backbone of the Hindu religion today' (p. 36). The present author repudiates totally this assertion. The author of this booklet has to admit that in the case of the Tantrik cult that abuse of the body of occult knowledge for malevolent purposes instead of for the material and spiritual advancement of man and the vulgarization of the profound rationale of the mystic ritual are deplorable deformations (p. 36), that there has doubtless been a grobs misuse of the knowledge developed by this science and that sparious texts have sprung up (p. 21).
