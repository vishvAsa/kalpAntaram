118. Jagannātha 

Tarkapancānana 

After the British took over the administration of Bengal from the Nabobs, attempts were made to compile easily acce ssible digests of the personal law of the Hindus. It appears that Warren Hastings conceived the idea that a compilation of laws applicable to Hindus should be prepared and called together

several Pandits (whose names are given in the note below ) 1633 to compile a digest in Sanskrit; this was translated into Persian and the Persian version was rendered into English by Nathaniel Brassey Halhed with a long Preface in English in which on P. XLIV he quotes the Gitā verse ( II. 22) - Vāsāmsi Jirṇāni' in original Sanskrit. Vide for this I. O. Cat. p. 458. This was a very unsatisfactory work. Another attempt was made by Trivedi Sarvoruśarman who compiled in 1789 for Sir William Jones another Digest of law called Vivādasārārṇava1534 in nine tarangas. This digest was suggested by Sir William Jones and two parts of it on contracts and succession were translated by Colebrooke in 1796. The translation was first published in 1797 A. D. and is known to the legal profession as Colebrooke's Digest. This work exercised great influence over the courts in their administration of Hindu Law in the early days. The work is divided into dvipas, each dvipa being subdivided in to ratnas. The principal topics dealt with are : recovery of debts, deposits, sale without ownership, partnership, rescission of gifts, non payment of wages, rescission of sale and purchase, emancipa tion from slavery, disputes between master and servant, duties of man and wife, inheritance and partition. Jagannatha is said to have died at the venerable age of 111 in 1806.1535 Vide ‘ Dictionary of Indian Biography' by C. E. Buckland published in 1906, where on p.415 the dates of his birth and death are put as 1695–1806 A. D. with question marks against both dates. It is said the date of his birth is based on tradition.' He had a wonderful memory, became a remarkable logician and unrivalled his knowledge of Hindu Law; he was consulted by Sir William Jones and Harr ington, he was held in great respect by the highest Hindu nobles

and the Hindu community. He had a free college for students; he left a great reputation as a scholar and died at a great age in 1806. 

Though Jagannātha exercised great influence in moulding Hindu Law in Bengal, his work has been held from very early times not to have any binding authority in Western India.1836
