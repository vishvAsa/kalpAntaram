85. Harihara 

From quotations in the Vivādaratnākara it appears that Hari hara wrote on vyavahāra. For example, the Vivādaratnākara first quotes (on p. 220) the definition of samsarapa' given by Bṛhaspati and then cites three verses of Kātyāyana defining a catusaptha and a rājamārga and prescribing punishments for causing obstruction and committing nuisance thereon. Then it notices that the verse 

yas-tatra' cited by it from Kātyāyana is cited by Harihara as from Prajāpati when the topic immediately preceding is 

saṁsarana '.1058 The Vivādaratnākara quotes a sūtra of Sarkha Likhita prescribing the punishment for sexual intercourse with a virgin against her will and Harihara's explanation of the word 

(Continued from the previous page) Brāhmaṇa, in all 52 works. At the and of the work (on p. 72), he names 46 works the opinions of which he considered and composed the Dāpasāgasa. The learned editor points this discrepancy in the Intro. (p. xxii ). 

The learned editor has spared no pains to make up the edition useful to scholars. I entirely agree with what he says about the late Professor Rangaswami Aiyangar's entirely redi culous remark about the Dānasāgara containing a reference to Kalpataru ( the work of Lakṣınidhara) in verse 3 of the introductory verses and his remarks about what the great historian Dr. R. C. Majumdar's reading 'sārasvata-brāhma ṇāḥ' in verse 6 of the Introductory verses of the Dāna sāgara (English Intro. p. xx foot-note 2). He has identi fied most of the quotations, but some have eluded him. For example on p. 17 the text quotes Vasiṣtha's verse 'ye kṣānta dāntāḥ ...', but the editor does not note that it is Vasistha Dharmasūtra VI, 25.

dvyangulaccheda ’1059 From these it is clear that Harihara wrote some work on vyavahara, which has not yet been recovered. He must have flourished earlier than 1300 A. D. 

There is a commentary on the Paraskaragļhyasūtra composed by Harihara who is styled agnihotrin in the colophons. In one ms. copied in sake 1707 (1785-86 A. D.) he is described as the pupil of Vijñānesvara. In the introductory second verse he says he relies on Vasudera. In the body of the work he refers (Gujarati Press edition) to Karkopādhyāya (p. 200 ), Kalpatarukāra, Repudikșita, and Vijñanesvarācārya (p. 370). Therefore he is later than 1150 A. D. Harihara's views are mentioned by Hemādri,1060 the Samaya pradipa1061 and Acārādarśa of Sridatta and in the Smṛtisāra of Harinātha. Therefore this Harihara must be earlier than 1250 A. D. Whether he was really the pupil of Vijñāneśvara is doubtful. In his bhāsya Harihara refers to words current in Kanoj. 1082 Hemādri mentions Harihara's explanation of nepalakambala wherein the latter says that it is well known among the northerners. 1063 Hariharapaddhati is frequently mentioned in the Smṛtitattva of Raghunandana ; vide (vol. I.) Srāddha p. 261, Ahnika p. 424, Malamāsa p. 745 ( a verse is quoted); (vol. II. ) Divya p. 593, Udvaha p. 132, Vrata p. 158 (name Harihara only). We have seen above that Harihara commented upon the Aśaucadaśaka of Vijñāneśvara. This fact together with his being not far from Vijñānesvara's time may have led to the belief that he was a pupil of Vijñanesvara. It appears probable that the jurist Harihara who flourished before 1300 and Harihara the bhāsyakāra of Paraskara

who flourished between 1150 and 1250 A. D. are identical. The views ascribed to Harihara by Hemādri in his section on śrāddha are not found in the bhāṣya on Pāraskara. Therefore Hemādri is referring to some other work of Harihara. From a passage of Hemādri it appears that Harihara wrote after the Mahārnava1064 ( Prakāśa ). Hemadri also tells us that Haribara refuted the views of Jayantasvāmi on a certain verse. 1065 The same Harihara who commented on Paraskara also wrote a commentary on Kātyāyana's Snānavidhisūtra wherein he mentions the Kalpatarukāra (vide D. C. ms, No. 101 of 1891-95). Several Hariharas are known. There is Hariharabhattācārya, the father of the great Bengal writer Raghunandana. A Hariharācārya composed an astrological work Samayapradipa in śake 1481 ( 1559–1560 A, D.).
