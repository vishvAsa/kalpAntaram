CHAPTER IX

Navarātra or Durgotsava

From the 1st of Āśvina bright half to the 9th is celebrated the Durgāpūjā festival, otherwise called Navarātra, observed all over India in some form or other. Some of the works[^390] provide that Durgotsava must be celebrated in both Śarad (Āśvina-śukla) and Vasanta (in Caitra-śukla). But it is the Durgotsava[^391] of Āśvina that is celebrated in a grand style, particularly in Bengal, Bihar and Kāmarūpa.

If a person is unable to celebrate the festival[^392] for nine days, he should do so for three days beginning from the 7th tithi of Āśvina-śukla. In fact, the Tithitattva [^393] puts forward several alternative periods for Durgāpuja as follows: (1) from the 9th tithi of the preceding dark half of Pūrṇimānta Āśvina to the 9th tithi of Āśvina-śukla; (2) from the first tithi of Āśvina śukla to 9th; (3) from the 6th to the 9th; (4) from the 7th to the 9th; (5) from the Mahāṣṭami to the 9th, (6) only on the Mahāṣṭami; (7) only on the Mahānavami. Most of these alternatives find support in the Kālikā and other Purāṇas.

In the तिथितत्त्व (pp. 64-65) रघुनन्दन interprets वार्षिकी as an adjective of महापूजा meaning yearly: but नागोजिभट्ट in his com. on सप्तशती (मार्कण्डेय 89.11) explains वर्षशब्दो वर्षादो लाक्षणिकः, तेन चैत्रशुक्लप्रतिपदमारम्य क्रियमाणा इत्यर्थः (folio 50 a of the ms. in the Bombay University Library described in Prof. Devasthali's Cat No. 1358).

As to महाष्टमी and महानवमी, the कालिका पुराण says 'आश्विनस्य तु शुक्लस्य भवेद्या अष्टमी तिथिः। महाष्टमीति सा प्रोक्ता देव्याः प्रीतिकरी परा॥ ततो तु नवमी या स्यात्सा महानवमी स्मृता ॥ chap. 62. 2-3; vide also देवीपुराण q. by हे.

## Durgotsava

There is a voluminous literature on Durgotsava. Every digest on vratas, tithis and pūjā devotes considerable space to this subject. Moreover, there are special treatises on Durgotsava or Navarātra, such as the Durgotsavaviveka of Sūlapāṇi, the Durgāpūjā-prayogatattva (published by the Sanskrit Sāhity Parishad, 1924) of which the Durgārcanapaddhati of Raghunandana (published by Jivananda, vol. II) is a part, Durgābhakti tarangiṇi of Vidyāpati,[^394] the Navarātra-pradipa of Vināyaka alias Nanda-paṇḍita, the Durgotsavapaddhati by Udayasimha (2nd half of 15th century A. D. ).[^395] Besides these, the Mārkandeyapurāṇa (chapters 78-90 in Venk. Press ed. and 81-93 in Banerji's) contains what is called Devīmāhātmya[^396] (or Saptaśati or Caṇḍi) in which are described the appearance of Devi from the accumulated _tejas_ of Viṣṇu, Śhaṅkara, Agni and other gods, her getting different weapons from the several gods such as the trident from Śiva, discus from Viṣṇu, Vajra from Indra, her victory over and slaughter of the great demon Mahisāsura, and of the demons Caṇḍa and Muṇḍa, Śumbha and Niśumbha. The Kālikāpurāṇa, the Br̥han-nandikeśvara-purāṇa[^397] and the Devipurāṇa also devote considerable space to Durgā and her pūjā. I have used, though not much, the English work on Durgā-pūjā by Pratapachandra Ghosh published so far back as 1871. My endeavour will be to give as briefly as possible an account of all the salient features of this great religious worship and festival from the Sanskrit texts themselves.

This pūjā is nitya as well as kāmya ;[^398] it is the first because the Kālikāpurāṇa (63. 12–13) prescribes that whoever, through laziness, hypocrisy, hatred or stupidity, does not celebrate the great festival of Durgā has all his desires frustrated by the angry Devi; it is also kāmya because rewards are promised when one celebrates Durgotsava 'all should always perform the worship of Devi in order to secure incomparable eminence which confers the puruṣārthas, viz. Dharma, Artha, Kāma and Mokṣa' and 'one should worship Bhavāni for pleasing her, for happiness in that year, for the destruction of evil spirits and goblins and for delight' (Tithitattva p. 65). The original purposes and objects of this festival were high and noble as stated in the Devipurāṇa [^399] "This is a great and holy vrata conferring great _siddhis_, vanquishing all enemies, conferring benefits on all people, especially in great floods; this should be performed by brāhmaṇas for solemn sacrifices and by kṣatriyas for the protection of the people, by vaiśyas for cattle wealth, by śūdras desirous of sons and happiness, by women for blessed wifehood and by rich men who hanker for more wealth; this was performed by Śhaṅkara and others". But in course of time, the objects were brought down to the ordinary level as stated in the Devimāhātmya [^400] 'by listening with devotion to my greatness in the great annual pūjā performed in autumn, a man becomes free from all troubles and becomes endowed with wealth and agricultural produce by my favour'. The exaggerated importance of this Durgā-pūjā will be clear from one verse of the Bhaviṣya 'rites like Agnihotra, solemn sacrifices described in the Vedas and completed with dakṣiṇā are not equal even to one hundred-thousandth part of the worship of Caṇḍika.'[^401]

This Durgāpūjā is very cosmopolitan in character. It could be performed not only by persons belonging to the four varṇas, but even by those who were outside the pale of the caste system, Durgā-pūjā has a congregational character and is not purely religious, but has also a social element in it (such as inviting friends and treating them &c.). The Bhaviṣyapurana[^402] says 'Devi should be worshipped (in her shrine) on Vindhya mountain, in all places, cities, houses, villages and forests by brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, kings, vaiśyas, śūdras, who are full of devotion, who have taken a bath and who are cheerful and jolly, by _mlecchas_ and other men (such as pratilomas) and by women'. In another place the Bhaviṣya states[^403] 'Durgā is worshipped by various groups of mlecchas, by all _dasyus_ (thievish tribes or outcaste Hindus), by people from Aṅga, Vaṅga and Kaliṅga, by kinnaras, Barbaras (non-Aryans) and Śakas'. Later medieval writers were careful to point out that mlecchas had no _adhikāra_ to perform _japa_ or _homa_ or _pūjā_ with mantras through a brāhmaṇa as śūdras had, but they could only mentally resolve to offer in honour of Devi animals as offerings and wine[^404] also and do so.   

[^394]: For the opening lines of this work, vide I, A, vol. 14 p. 192; it was published at Darbhanga in 1900 A.D. in Devanagari script. Reference is made to the pages of this edition in the following.

[^396]: Modern scholars generally hold that the Devimāhātmya, of which the oldest known ms. is dated in 998 A.D. (as stated in Winternitz's 'History of Indian Literature, English Translation, 1927, p. 565 note 2) was later inserted in the Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa. Though the Devimāhātmya is called Saptaśati (collection of 700 verses), the total number of verses there. in is only about 573 to 590 in different mss, and editions The Venk. press edition in chap, 78-90 has 589 and K. M. Banerjea's in chap. 81-93 has 573, Nāgojibhatta in his com. on सप्तशती  remarks (folio 55b) 'अष्टसप्तत्युत्तराणां श्लोकानां शतपञ्चकम्। प्रोक्तं सप्तशतीस्तोत्रं तत्सप्तशतसंरव्यया'.The number 700 is made up by looking upon words like उवाच as मन्त्रs and half verses as full verses and so on. The 13 chapters are divided into three parts, chap. I being प्रथमचरित, chap. 2-4 being मध्यमचरित and 5-13 being उत्तमचरित. The 77 or 78 verses of the 1st chapter (प्रथमचरित) are made into 104 mantras vis. उवाचमन्त्राः 14, अर्धमन्त्राः 24, श्लोकमन्त्राः 66. The सप्तशती is treated as if it were a Vedic hymn or verse with ऋषि, metres, प्रधानदेवता, and विनियोग (for जप) 'अस्य श्रीसप्तशतीमन्त्रस्य मार्कण्डेय-ब्रह्मेन्द्र-वासुदेव-रुद्रा ऋषयः। गायञ्युष्णिगनुष्टप् छन्दांसि। मधुकैटभमर्दिनी-महिषासुरसेनामहिषासुरमर्दिनी-धूम्रलोचनचण्डमुण्डरक्तबीजशुम्भनिशुम्भमर्दिन्यः प्रधानदेवताः।. Besides, some verses are described as कवच (armour), otbers as अर्गल ( bolt for fastening) and still others as कीलक (pin, the inner syllables of a mantra); पठित्वा कवचं चादौ अर्गलं कीलकं तथा । जपेत्सप्तशतीं चण्डीं क्रम एष शिवोदितः॥. These three (कवच, अर्गल and कीलक) are outside the देवीमाहात्म्य. The महिषासुरवध in वराहपुराण chap. 95 is to some extent different from the description in the other purāṇas. It appears to be the earliest Paurāṇika version of the slaughter of Mahiṣāsura.

It is stated in the Skanda and Bhaviṣya [^405] purāṇas that the worship of Caṇḍikā in autumn (Aśvina) is of a threefold character; viz. sāttviki, rājasi and tāması; the sāttviki worship is effected by _japa_, by offering _naivedya_ in which there is no meat; and japa consists in reciting the texts of the purāṇas in which the greatness of Devi is described; rājasi worship is effected by offering a _bali_ and with naivedya which contains flesh; that is tāmasi worship which is effected by the offerings of wine and meat and from which _japa_ is absent and which is without mantras; this last is approved among Kirātas (i.e. forest tribes and the like). Raghunandana adds [^406] in his Prāyascittatattva that the offering of wine in Durgāpūjā relates to ages other than the Kali age (i.e. other than the present age).

It has been stated above (pp.110-111, n. 280) that the principal gods are deemed to go to sleep for four months on different tithis from the _pratipad_ (1st) of Āṣāḍha-śukla to the 15th. Therein Durgā is said to go to sleep on the 8th of the bright half of Āṣāḍha. Therefore, in Āśvina she would be asleep. Hence the texts provide for the rousing (_bodhana_) of Devi from sleep. As usual there are conflicting views. The Tithitattva [^407] notices the views of some that if the Devi is to be worshipped as having 18 arms she was to be roused on the 9th of the dark half preceding Aśvina bright half, but that if she was to be worshipped as possessing ten arms then the bodhana was to be on the 6th (of the bright half of Aśvina). Raghunandana does not accept this and holds that the _bodhana_ of Devī with ten arms was to be either on the 9th (of the preceding dark half) or on the 6th (of the bright half of Āśvina). If the performer begins on the 9th of the dark half the saṅkalpa will be as noted below.[^408] He may, however, begin on the first tithi of Aśvina bright half and then the bodhana will be on the 6th of the bright half. If he begins on the pratipad the saṅkalpa will be as noted below.[^409] Then he should recite Ṛg. VII. 16. 11 'God [^410] Draviṇodas specially desires your ladle filled (with offering); may you pour out (Soma) or fill (the vessel with Soma); the god then immediately comes down’. Then he should establish a ghaṭa* (a jar with a peculiar shape, the central portion bulging out, the neck narrow and the brim being broad and open), fill it with water, place twigs of mango and other sacred trees thereon and worship Durgā with the 16 or 5 upacāras. Then he should offer materials such as sandal-wood paste, myrobalan for purifying the hair and also a comb.[^411] On the 2nd tithi he should offer a silken ribbon for keeping the hair in position, on the third alaktaka (red lac) dye for reddening the feet, vermilion for putting it on the head, a mirror for observing the face; on the 4th tithi he should offer _madhuparka_ (to the goddess), a silver piece having the shape of a tilaka (for the forehead) and collyrium as decoration for the eyes; on the 5th tithi he should offer sandalwood paste, unguents and ornaments according to his means.

If he starts Durgāpūjā-utsava from the 6th tithi either conjoint with Jyeṣṭhā-nakṣatra or without it he should go in the morning near a _bilva_ tree, should utter the saṅkalpa noted below,[^412] repeat Ṛg. VII. 16. 11, establish a _ghaṭa_, should worship the _bilva_ tree as Durgā. If he has already started the utsava on _pratipad_, then he should go near a bilva tree in the evening conjoint with Jyeṣṭhā or without it (and even if ṣaṣṭhi has expired before evening, then in the evening without ṣaṣṭhi) and rouse Devī with the mantra [^413] ‘for the destruction of Rāvaṇa and in order to favour Rāma, Brahmā, O goddess, in former times roused you at an unusual time; therefore, I also awaken you in the evening of the 6th tithi of Aśvina.' After thus awakening Devi he should invite the bilva tree with the words "O bilva tree! born on the top of Śriśaila and the abode of Lakṣmi, I have to take you; come, you are to be worshipped as Durgā.' Then he should, after taking each of the substances mentioned below and accompanying each with a mantra, place them on the bilva tree and make it an auspicious dwelling place for Durgā. The substances for making a holy [^414] residence for Devi are; earth or clay, sandalwood paste, pebbles, coriander, dūrvā grass, flowers, fruits, curds, ghee, _svastika_, vermilion, conch-shell, collyrium, rocanā (yellow pigment), mustard seeds, gold, silver, copper, whisk, mirror, lamp, _praśastipātra (a broad plate). Then he should repair to the _pandal_ erected for Durgāpūjā, perform _ācamana_, should bind together with Aparājita creeper twigs or leaves of nine plants [^415] so as to form one bundle or sheaf, viz. plantain, pomegranate, coriander, turmeric, Arum Indicum, Arum colocacia, bilva, aśoka and jayanti. Each of these substances is accompanied by an appropriate separate mantra.

He should offer worship to the bundle of nine plants and to the image (of Durgā) and make the Devi abide in the bilva tree with sandalwood (and other substances mentioned above). The rousing (bodhana) of the Devi and the invitation to the bilva tree are separate and are done with separate mantras (Tithitattva pp. 75-76). The two may be done at the same time if 6th tithi exists in the evening; but if it does not exist in the evening then _bodhana_ may be done on the 6th and invitation on the 7th or bodhana may be done in the morning and invitation in the evening. The clay image of Durgā together with the twig of bilva is to be entered in the house and worshipped. The details of the complicated discussion are not set out here.

Then follow acts to be done on the 7th tithi, On the 7th tithi conjoint with mūla-nakṣatra or without it the performer after taking a bath approaches a bilva tree, worships it, folds his hands and says 'O blessed bilva tree! you are always dear to Śaṅkara; after taking from you a branch I shall perform Durgā worship; O Lord! you should not feel pain due to the cutting of a branch; O bilva! prince among trees, salutation to you!' After saying this he should cut off from the bilva tree a branch other than one in the south-west or north-west and endowed with a couple of fruits (or without fruit) with the mantra noted below.[^416] Then he should take the branch, come to the place of worship (the maṇḍapa or the like ) and place it on a piṭha (a seat). Then taking white mustard grains he throws them with two mantras and effects the driving away of goblins, evil spirits, rakśasas, Vināyakas that cause obstacles, takes up an offering of boiled rice and _māṣa_ pulse and requests Kāli who is surrounded by goblins to accept that _bali_ for protection against the evil spirits and prays her to confer upon himself all his objects in return for the offering of the _bali_. He then establishes the bundle of (the leaves and twigs) of nine plants tied together with Aparājitā creeper and the bilva branch. He worships the latter with 'salutation to the bilva branch' and honours Cāmuṇḍā on the bilva branch and the clay image with the words 'this is pādya (water for washing the feet), salutation to Cāmuṇḍā' and addresses the bilva branch with the mantra quoted in n. 413 above. Then he utters the mantra 'O Cāmuṇḍā'! move, move, make others move, enter my house quickly and go to the place of worship, _svāhā_'. Then he establishes the _ghaṭa_, worships the nine plants and five devatās, establishes the image on a seat and the bundle of nine plants to its right to the accompaniment of songs and instrumental music and places the bilva branch in a copper vessel near the (image of) Devi and performs the praṇapratiṣṭhā [^417] (vivifying or endowing with life) of the image of the Devi and of Gaṇeśa and other deities in the manner provided in the Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 666) and Tithitattva (pp. 77-78). Then he should, after taking in his hand husked rice-grains and flowers, contemplate upon the form of Devi. Then the Durgārcanapaddhati (pp. 666-667) quotes a long but finely worded passage from the Matsya; the corresponding passage from the Kālikāpurāṇa may be briefly rendered as follows: [^418] Devi possesses a mass of hair, her head ornament is the crescent of the moon, she has three eyes, her face resembles a lotus and (full) moon, her complexion is like molten gold, she is well formed and has charming eyes, she is endowed with blooming youth, decked with all kinds of ornaments, has charming teeth, looks keen and has full and upraised breasts, her posture is such that she is bent at three places, she has crushed the demon Mahiṣa, she has ten arms long and soft like lotus stalks, she holds a trident in the right hand and a sword and discus below that (trident) in order, a sharp arrow and śakti (missile) in the group of her arms, a shield, a fully bent bow, a noose, a goad (held in order) from above and a bell and axe should be held in the left hand from below; under her one should show a headless buffalo from which rises a demon with a sword in his hand, who is pierced in the region of the heart by the trident (of Devi), who (demon) possesses teeth set awry, whose body is dyed red with blood, whose eyes are bloodshot and distended, who is encircled by a noose of snakes, whose face is rendered fearful by his curved eyebrows, whose hair is seized by Durgā with the left hand holding a noose, whose mouth emits blood; one should exhibit Devi's lion; the right foot of Devi (should be shown) as resting evenly on the lion's back and her left foot toe (resting) a little higher on the demon.

Then the performer should put a flower on his head, take flowers and rice grains in his hand and make an invocation (āvāhana) with two mantras to Durgā to be present in the bilva branch and establish her with the prayer to bestow long life, health and prosperity. He offers to the Devi the several upacāras of asana, pādya, arghya &c. Then he should go near the sheaf of nine plants and repeat the mantra "O blessed Durgā! come, enter into the (sheaf of) plants; this is your place in the mortal world; I throw myself on your mercy"! So saying he should worship Devi in the _ghaṭa_ (jar) with ten or five upacāras or with flowers and sandalwood paste with separate mantras for each of the nine plants (mentioned in note 415) in the form 'Hrim, om, kadalisthāyai brahmāṇyai namaḥ' and so on (Durgārcanapaddhati [^419] p. 669). Then he should worship Durgā with pādya and other upacāras[^420] and offer a kid or the like as an offering. The kid or he-buffalo should be dark and should be at least five years old[^421].

Much has been written about the sacrifice of animals in Durgāpūjā. Only a few points can be dealt with here. The Kālikā-purāṇa enumerates the following animals as fit for sacrifice in honour of Durgā and Bhairava[^422] "birds, tortoises, crocodiles, fish, deer of nine kinds, buffalo, _gavaya_(Gayal), bull, goat, _mongoose_, boar, rhinoceros, black antelope, śarabha (a fabulous animal), lion, tiger, a human being and blood from one's own (i.e. the performer's) body"; but the females of the species specified above were not to be offered as _bali_ and the person who did so would go to hell. This was probably a concession to placate Devi who might have a soft corner for a _bali_ of her own sex. The bali should have no defect and should not be one whose tail or ears were cut off. Though the above list of victims that may be offered is long, usually only goats and he-buffaloes were sacrificed. It is said[^423] 'the Devi that resides on Vindhya is not so well pleased with the offerings of flowers, incense, and unguents and of other animals as she is pleased with offerings of rams and he-buffaloes'. The Varsa-kriya-kaumudi[^424] quotes "one should never offer to the great Devi a horse or elephant; if a brāhmaṇa offers a lion, a tiger or a human being (as _bali_) he would go to hell and even in this world he would have a short life and would be devoid of happiness and prosperity; if (a brāhmaṇa) offers his own blood, he would be guilty of suicide. If a brāhmaṇa offered wine he would lose his status as a brāhmaṇa. When wine is laid down as a necessary offering he should offer cocoanut water in a vessel of bell-metal or honey in a copper vessel." But there were texts that contradict this. For example, it is said in the Kalikapuraṇa 'goat, he-buffalo, human being are declared to be bali, mahābali and atibali, respectively.'[^425] It has to be remembered that though an animal is killed still what is offered to the Devi is generally blood and the head of the victim. The Kālikāpurāṇa[^426] says 'blood purified by the recitation of mantras over it and the head (of a victim) are said to be nectar; in the worship (of Devi) the adept worshipper should offer flesh rarely (if at all) except blood and the head, which (two) become nectar." The Kālikāpurāṇa further states that Śiva (Durgā) partakes of the head as well as the flesh of the victim, that one should offer in pūjā the blood and head of the victim, but the wise ( devotee ) should employ flesh in edibles and in _homa_. The Durgārcanapaddhati (pp. 669-671) prescribes an elaborate ritual about killing the _bali_ and offering its blood and head and the rites and mantras slightly differ according as the bali is a goat, a buffalo or the performer's own blood. The[^427] _bali_ is made to face the east, the sādhaka (devotee) faces the north and repeats certain mantras one of which is Vāj. S. 23. 17 'Agni was the animal to be sacrificed. They sacrificed with him, he conquered this world (the earth) on which Agni exists; that will be your world, you will conquer that world, drink this water. Vāyu (wind God) was the animal &c.; the Sun was the animal &c.' Another mantra is Manu V.39 (=Viṣṇudharmasūtra 51.61=Kālikā 71.39) viz. 'animals were created by Brahmā himself for serving the purpose of sacrifice, for the well-being of sacrifice and of all; therefore killing (an animal) in a sacrifice is no killing (does not cause the sin or blame of ordinary killing)'. He should place on the head of the bali a flower with a mantra; then he sprinkles water with kuśas over the bali and then worships the sword with the mantra "you are the tongue of Caṇḍikā and you accomplish heaven (for the worshipper); Hrīm, Srim, O sword!'. The performer contemplates on the sword as described in Tithitattva (p. 81) and Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 670), honours it with sandalwood paste and the rest and repeats eight names of the gword, bows to it, takes it up with the words 'Ām, Hrīm, Phaṭ' and with one stroke cuts off the victim facing the east ( while the performer faces the north ) or facing the north (while the performer faces the east). Then he collects blood in a vessel of clay or other material, places it before the Devi and offers it with the words 'this is the blood of the goat; Om, O Jayanti!' and says 'Aim, Hrim, Śrim, O Kausiki! May she be pleased by the blood.' Then he offers the head of the bali (goat or the like) placing on the head a lamp with a flaming wick. He then takes blood from the sword (with which the animal's neck was cut) and makes a _tilaka_ mark with it on his forehead with two mantras. It was supposed that the tilaka of blood would make all persons amenable to the person who had that blood mark on the forehead as the mantra quoted below expresses. When the _bali_ is a buffalo, the mantras repeated over a goat are omitted and two others are substituted viz. 'as you hate a horse and as you carry Caṇḍikā, so kill my enemies and bring happiness, O buffalo; you are the vehicle of Yama, you possess excellent form, you who are deathless; bestow on me long life, wealth, fame, a bow to you who are a buffalo'. The fruit of offering buffalo's blood to Devi was deemed to be her gratification and favour for a hundred years. Then he performs japa of a mantra (quoted in note )[^428] and also certain verses of laudation and asks for certain benefits (Durgārcana. p. 672)[^429].

The Kālikāpurāṇa in a long passage[^430] provides gradually rising periods of times for which Durgā becomes gratified by the offering of the blood of various animals. A few might be cited here: "Durgā secures satisfaction for one month by the (offering of the) blood of fishes and tortoises, and for two months by (the blood of) crocodiles; by the blood of the black antelope and of the boar Devi is pleased for twelve years and by the blood of buffalo and rhinoceros for a hundred years; by the blood of the lion, the śarabha and from the performer's body Devi is gratified for a thousand years and by a human being as a bali for a thousand years." There was a revulsion of feeling against blood sacrifices in some hearts and so even the Kālikā provides[^431] that the offerings of kūṣmāṇḍa (pumpkin-gourd) and sugarcane stalks, intoxicants and _āsavas_ (spirits distilled from molasses, flowers or herbs) are like (animal) victims and gratification (to the Devi) is the same as by the offering of a goat. But even in these days castes deemed higher, even including brāhmaṇas, offer goats and rarely buffaloes to Durgā, if that is the custom of the caste or family. I understand that many families of learned brāhmaṇas such as the Bhattācāryas of Bhatpara in West Bengal sacrifice fruits and vegetables in lieu of animals. The Ahalyākāma-dhenu[^432] says that some Vaiṣṇavas regard the night when victims are killed as horrible and do not eat food or even drink water on that night and that among brāhmaṇa castes the offering (bali) should be in the form of kūṣmāṇḍa and the like or flour images of animals or simple ghee should be offered. As to other castes also it has been declared that kūṣmāṇḍa, bilva fruit, sugarcane stalks may be cut into pieces.

The convenient belief from very ancient times has been that a victim offered in sacrifice to gods and pitṛs went to heaven. Ṛg. I. 162.21[^433] = Vāj. S. 23. 16 ) and Manu V. 42 say so. Hemādri quotes verses saying that all the animals such as the buffalo that are employed for (gratifying) Devi go to heaven and those that kill them incur no sin[^434].

The foregoing is somewhat of a digression, as the _bali_ is generally to be sacrificed on the 9th and as the rites of even of the 8th have not yet been described. On the Mahāṣṭami conjoined to Pūrvāṣāḍhā-nakṣatra or without it, the devotee after taking a bath and sipping water, should face the east or north, sit on a seat of _darbhas_, perform purification of himself and the body which is made up of five elements by repeating separately the mystic letters 'yam, ram, lam, vam' in the manner set out on p. 673 of Durgārcanapaddhati; then he performs _prāṇāyāma_, and then _nyāsa_ on the several parts of the body from the heart and head to the feet. He sprinkles over himself and the materials of worship water contained in a vessel of conch-shell and the like and over which he mutters eight times the mantra 'Hrim, Om Durgāyai namaḥ', he contemplates on Durgā as described on p. 163 and note 418 above, places a flower on his head, mentally offers _upacāras_ (to Devi), again contemplates on Devi's form and then offers the upacāras from _āsana_ (seat) to praṇāma (as indicated in note 420 above) with appropriate brief mantras. Then he offers worship to several goddesses to the right side, front side and left side of Devi with brief mantras and to the Mātr̥s[^435] (64 are enumerated in Durgārcanao. pp. 676 677, or 32, or 16 or 8) according to one's ability with five upacāras or with sandalwood paste and flowers and to the eight mātr̥s Brahmāni &c. Then there is _aṅgapūjā_ (worship of Devi's limbs) from heart and head to the feet. Then worship is offered to her weapons such as trident, sword, discus, sharp arrow, shield, fully strung bow, the noose, goad, bell; and then her lion-seat is honoured and also armour, whisk, umbrella, flag and flag-staff, drum, conch. Separate mantras are recited in connection with the pūjā of each of these, as laid down in Durgārcanapaddhati pp. 678-681, in the Nirṇayasindhu pp. 179-181 (which quotes them from Viṣṇudharmottara) and other works. They are all passed over here for saving space. Then he goes near the sheaf of nine plants and worships it with five upacāras or with sandalwood paste and flowers offered to each separately. Then he makes an offering of _māṣa_ pulse and boiled rice.

On the day on which there is Mahāṣṭamipūjā the performer observes a fast. But a householder [^436] who has a son should not observe a fast on the Mahāṣṭami. He should follow one of the alternatives specified above in note 252 (naktam haviṣyānnam &c). Whatever procedure about food he may follow, he, keeping himself pure and observing the rules of conduct for vrata, should worship Devi; he should offer worship on the Mahāṣṭami and on the 9th with _balis_; he should take leave (of Devi) on the 10th with Śravaṇa-nakṣatra after performing the Śābara festival. When the last quarter of Śravaṇa (nakṣatra) is running then he should give a send-off to Devi on the 10th tithi. The Tithitattva [^437] positively asserts that a fast is to be observed on the same day on which Mahāṣṭami-pūjā is performed.


[^435]: The मातृs are eight, ब्रह्माणी, माहेश्वरी, कौमारी, वैष्णवी, वाराही, इन्द्राणी, चामुण्डा, महालक्ष्मी. Vide दुर्गार्चन p. 677.दु. भ. त. p 46 gives the names some what differently. This whole procedure of the 8th tithi is very lengthy and tiresome to read It bas been very much shortened in the above.

On this 8th tithi the performer has to honour maidens, feed them and brāhmaṇas also. He may honour a maiden or maidens from the first to the 9th tithi, but he must do so at least on 8th. The Devipurāṇa [^438] says "Durgā is not so much gratified by _homa_, gifts and _japa_ as she is gratified (becomes favourable) by honouring maidens." And he has to give them dakṣiṇā also. Hemādri (on vrata vol. I. 903-906) quotes a long passage from the Skanda-purāṇa on this subject. Skanda provides that the performer should feed maidens from the first tithi of Navarātra on a rising scale, viz. one maiden on the first tithi, two on the 2nd and so on up to nine on the 9th. If he feeds nine virgins every day (of the Navarātra) he secures land; if he feeds double the number on each succeeding day he gets prosperity. He should not honour a maiden who is one year old (or less), for, such a girl has not developed at that age liking for fruits, flowers and sandalwood paste. Therefore, he should honour maidens who are from two to ten years old, and not those that are beyond ten years. The Devipurāṇa provides that if no virgin is available, one may honour even a married girl who has had no menstruation.[^439] The Skanda provides that maidens from two years to ten should be honoured under the following names respectively, viz. Kumārika (two years old), Trimūrti (three years old), Kalyāṇi, Rohiṇī, Kāli, Caṇḍikā, Śāmbhavi, Durgā, Subhadra. The Skanda provides special pūjā mantras for each of the nine kinds of maidens and different rewards are provided for honouring each of the nine classes. These are passed over here.

The general _āvāhanamantra_ for all in the morning after the performer has taken a ceremonial bath with oil is noted below.[^440] In this way he is to honour virgins with bodice, clothes, sandalwood paste, flowers and _akṣatas_, with different kinds of edibles and dishes and feed them with _pāyasa_ (rice boiled in milk and sugar). One should not honour a maiden that has a limb more or less, that suffers from leprosy, or that has varicose veins or has a broken head or has limbs from which blood or pus oozes or has ulcers, that is blind from birth, is squint-eyed or blind of one eye or is ugly or has little hair or much hair or is diseased or is born of a slave woman. A man should honour a brāhmaṇa maiden in all acts, a kṣatriya maiden for victory, one belonging to untouchable castes in acts of terrible nature. After the maidens are fed, brāhmaṇas also should be fed (Durgārcana. pp. 681).

The Tithitattva (pp. 69-72), Nirṇayasindhu and other works provide that in the Navarātra the performer should hear the recitation of the Vedas (Vedapārāyaṇa) and that beginning with the first tithi up to the 9th he should himself mutter Caṇḍipāṭha (recitation of Devimāhātmya) or engage a person to do so, reciting it once on the first, twice on 2nd tithi and so on up to nine times on 9th tithi. The Devipurāṇa provides for pūjā, japa and homa and the mantras therefore by saying that the worship of Devi is to be performed by casting into the fire sesame and with curds, milk and ghee. The Devi mantra is either what is called the Jayantimantra[^441] (quoted in note ) or the mantra of nine syllables ( quoted in the note). The Dvaitanirṇaya-siddhāntasangraha states that the mantra is either one that a man's _guru_ has taught him, or the Vedic verse 'Jātavedase sunavāma'(Ṛg. I. 99.1) or one with nine letters or the one 'namo dovyai mahādevyai' or the ślokas in the Saptaśatī[^442].

The Tithitattva quotes (pp. 69–71) a long passage from the Vārāhi-tantra about the result of reciting Devimāhātmya several times. A few verses are cited for sample. “When some great danger threatens, one should recite (Devimāhātmya) seven times; if repeated twelve times one secures fulfilment of one's desires and the destruction of enmity; if repeated 14 times, an enemy would be subdued and a woman would be brought under one's control; repeating a hundred times results in increase of one's kingdom; if repeated a thousand times Lakṣmi comes to a man of her own accord. As Aśvamedha is the prince among sacrifices, as Hari (is superior) among gods, so the laud called Saptaśati is the highest among all lauds.[^443]" The Tithitattva further provides that one should recite[^444] before the reading of the 'prathamacarita' the ṛṣi (sage), the metre &c. of it and also when repeating the _Madhyamacarita_ and the _Uttaracarita_. Very great importance was attached in ancient and medieval times to the recitation of mantras and even modern men brought up in English schools, colleges and Universities often implicitly believe in their efficacy, even if one may not understand their meaning. The qualities of the sounds of mantras or of parts of mantras ( such as ‘hrim') and their potentialities, the various devices employed when using them are deemed of far greater importance than the meaning. The Gītā (X. 25) itself puts Japa-yajña as the highest among yajñas such as those of _dravya_ (materials or money), tapoyajña (Gītā IV. 28). Mantras are supposed to have a tremendous effect on the sub-conscious mind and it may perhaps be so if one concentrates one's mind thereon to the exclusion of all else. A person could himself recite the Saptaśatī or engage a person to read it to him who was called _pāṭhaka_ or _vācaka_ as in T. T. p. 72, Durgārcana. p. 661. Some very orthodox writers went so far as to lay down that a śūdra could only listen to the Mahābhārata or Saptaśati but could not read it himself. Raghunandana [^445] like Kamalakara appears to have held this view.

One should stop reading at the end of a chapter and not in its middle; but if for some reason one had to stop in the middle of a chapter, when one again commenced reading or reciting Saptaśati, one should not proceed from where one left off in the middle of a chapter, but begin with the first verse of the chapter half read or recited. Provision was made that the reader engaged for reading Saptaśati should be handsomely requited for his labour by gifts of gold, silver, cows with bell-metal pails for milking. Mr Ghosh notes (p. 39) that besides the reader of Devimāhātmya a separate priest is selected to repeat the mūlamantra a hundred thousand times and is called _Jāpaka_. The Nirṇayasindhu (pp. 185–186) gives elaborate descriptions of Satacaṇḍi-pāṭha and Sahasracaṇḍi. In the first, ten well-conducted brāhmaṇas including the _ācārya_ are chosen. They are to recite together Saptaśati once on the 1st day, twice on the 2nd, thrice on the 3rd and four times on the 4th; in this way Saptaśati would be repeated one hundred times. In Sahasracaṇdi one hundred brāhmaṇas are to be chosen and they are to repeat Saptaśati for four days as in Satacaṇḍi-pāṭha. A thousand brāhmaṇas are to be fed and one hundred cows are to be donated. The Nirṇayasindhu notes that these two are not included in the great digests but there is popular usage to this effect.

After each pūjā prescribed for the day, the family members, their friends and guests sit together and partake of the _prasāda_ (which in the houses of the well-to-do comprises select delicacies). Formerly, the persons sitting together would have sometimes - numbered hundreds, but in the days of rationing and control, this would not happen. Mukerji (p. 124) notes that guests made offerings to the goddess (usually cash which belongs to the owner and not to the priest.)

After the pūjā, homa is performed as indicated above; offerings are to be made in fire called 'Balada '[^446] with the word 'svāhā' at the end to the accompaniment of a mantra preceded by 'om'. The Durgārcana-paddhati notes (p. 681 ) that after the special rites on the Mahāṣṭami described above (viz. pūjā, honouring maidens, homa &c.) are finished the rest of the tithi should be spent by the devotee in dance, songs[^447] and music(jāgara ).

[^446]: Vide ति.त. p. 99 for the names of the fires employed in religious rites; 'एवं च दुर्गापूजनस्य पौष्टिककर्मत्वात् तदङ्गहोमे बलदनामाग्निरिति।। ति. त. p. 99.

[^447]: नटनर्तकसङ्घैश्च वेश्याभिश्चैव भैरव। नृत्यगीतैः समुदितो जागरं कारयेष्यिसि। कालिका 61. 88.

It appears that in the Devi and Kālikā purāṇas it is provided that even on the 8th at midnight an animal such as a goat or he-buffalo should be sacrificed and that on the 9th tithi many _balis_ were to be sacrificed. When the Sun is in the sign of Kanya (Virgin or Virgo) and in the month of Isa (Āśvina ) one should offer pūjā on the 9th tithi of the bright half; one should observe a fast (on that tithi) and at midnight should begin pūjā of Devi with great expenditure and paraphernalia when the nakṣatra is Mūla or Purvāṣāḍhā; an animal should be killed and a he-buffalo and a goat should be sacrificed'.[^448]

A short period of time, viz. the last _ghaṭikā_ [^449] of Mahāṣṭami and the first ghaṭika of navami, was called 'sandhi'. During that period of two ghaṭikās a pūjā of Devi together with Yoginis is to be performed which is deemed to be the holiest pūjā (Ghosh p. 120). This puja is to be performed like the puja on Mahāṣṭami, but the bali is to be offered at and after the Mahānavami begins [^450] and not during the last ghaṭikā of Mahāṣṭami.

Now the rites of the Mahānavami have to be described. On the 9th tithi conjoined to Uttarāṣādhā nakṣatra or without it, pūjā is to be performed on the lines of the one of Mahāṣṭami. This day's puja is [^451] only a repetition of that on the 8th, the only difference being that a larger number of balis (goats etc.) may be sacrificed on it than on the 8th tithi. A bali is to be offered as it is obligatory to do so on the 9th[^452]. Then the worshipper should perform homa, if able to do so. If he be unable to perform homa on both days, he should perform it on Mahāṣṭami. The offerings in the fire are to be 108. If a person cannot perform a homa in person he should choose a brāhmaṇa to do it, while a śūdra must always get the homa performed through a brāhmaṇa. Lamps should be waved before the Devi (nirājana)[^452a] from her head down to her feet. Dakṣiṇā (fee) to the priest for the whole of the autumnal pūjā is to be given on the 9th tithi and Raghunandana expressly [^453] says that the Durgā-bhakti taraṅgini is wrong in saying that dakṣiṇā is to be paid after taking leave (_visarjana_) of Devi. The saṅkalpa at the time of giving dakṣiṇa is given in the note[^454]. If no dakṣiṇa be paid, the whole rite becomes fruitless. Then he should pray that 'all defects in the pūjā may be remedied, that whatever he has offered with a devout heart, whether leaves or flowers, fruits or water, whatever naivedya he has offered, may be graciously accepted by Devi and that if any mistake has occurred by his missing some letter or _mantra_ Devī should forgive all that.' He should wash the feet of a brāhmaṇa maiden and give her sumptuous dinner and ask her to place with her hand on his head _akṣatas_ and devoutly follow her a few steps. He should feed brāhmaṇas. It is the practice in many families to embrace each other and sing the praise of Durgā while drums are beaten. Then in a large procession they visit the houses of such relatives and neighbours as have performed the pūjā. Then the united procession visits other houses and the parties return the visits to each other by turns and wish happiness and good luck to each other and offer sweets. Rājanītiprakāśa (pp. 439–444) quotes a long passage from the Devi-purāṇa about the worship of Devi on 9th of Āsv. śu.

[^451]: पुनः पूजां तथाष्ठम्यां विशेषेण समाचरेत् । जागरं च स्वयं कुर्याद् बलिदानं महानिशि। प्रभूतबलिदानं तु नवम्यां विधिवञ्चरेत् । ध्यायेद्दशभुजां देवी दुर्गामन्त्रेण पूजयेत् । विसर्जनं दशम्यां तु कुर्याद्वै साधकोत्तमः । कालिका 62. 8-10; vide also कालिका 61. 26 28 'नवम्यां बलिदानानि प्रभूतानि समाचरेत् । सन्ध्यायां च बलिं कुर्यान्निजगात्रासुगुक्षितम् एवं कृते तु कल्याणेर्युक्तो नित्यं प्रमोदते। पुत्रपौत्रसमृद्धस्तु धनधान्यसमृद्धिभिः'।.

On the 10th tithi after bathing and sipping water he should offer worship with sixteen upacāras or with as many as possible, should praise Devi with these words 'Om Durgām Śivām' &c. (on p. 672 of Durgārcanapaddhati), should prostrate himself before her and make request to Devi with the mantra 'Mahiṣaghni mahāmāye &c.' (ibid. p. 672) and with the verse quoted [^454a] below take a flower and cast it on the image with the words 'forgive'. Then after repeating two verses he should raise the image (of Devi), the bilva twig and the sheaf of nine plants from their places and keep them in another place and wave lamps made of [^454b] flour before them. He should go near the water of a river with dance, song, music, Vedic recitations and auspicious sports and pastimes and immerse the image in a tank or in a river after the prayer [^454c] 'O Durgā, mother of the world, go to your place in order to come back after the lapse of a year.' Then he should perform the _śābarotsava_. This last means that actions usually associated with the śabaras (i.e. aboriginal tribes like the Bhils &c.) should be indulged in (to express ecstacy of the Durgāpūjā) on the 10th tithi after the immersion of the image of Devi.[^455] The Kālaviveka quotes Satya to the effect that leave is taken of Devi on the last _pāda_ of Śravaṇa nakṣatra in the day and śābarotsava is celebrated on the 10th, and explains that what is meant is that like men of the Śabara tribe, people wear leaves of trees, their bodies are besmeared with mire, they make incoherent prancing movements and are engaged in dances, songs and music. The Kālikāpurāṇa dwells on this at great length. It says: " the _visarjana_ ( sending away) of Devī should be made with festivals in the manner of śabaras, viz. people may make merry to their heart's content by throwing dust and mud, with auspicious sports and revelry, with indulgence in words and songs referring to male and female organs and with words expressive of the sexual act. The Devi becomes angry with him who does not abuse another and whom others do not abuse and pronounces on him a terrible curse." This provision that every one, how highsoever, was to join in the śabarotsava was probably made for emphasizing that before the Devi the highest and the lowest were of equal status and every one must join in the frolics on the 10th tithi to show that all men were equal at least one day in the year. After the immersion friends visit friends and partake of sweets. It appears that this last practice is now not in vogue.

A few words must be said with reference to certain relevant matters. How Devi was to be contemplated upon can be seen from p. 163, note 418 above. That shows that only the image of Devi with the lion and the demon Mahiṣāsura was to be constructed. In the Mārk. puraṇa[^456] it is stated that Devī strode over the great demon's throat, struck him with her trident and with her heavy sword cut off his head and made him fall down on the ground. But in modern times the image of Devi is placed in a structure of wickerwork and there are images of Lakṣmi and Gaṇeśa on the right side and of Sarasvati and Kartikeya on the left[^457]. Raghunandana does not make much of these additional deities, though he speaks of the prāṇapratisthā of Gaṇeśa and others. On p. 146 of 'Cave temples of India' by Fergusson and Burgess reference is made to a tableau at Mahavalli-puram of the strife between Mahisāsura and Devi ( with eight arms), which the learned authors assign to the period 650-700 A. D. The image may be made of gold or silver, clay, metal, stone or there may only be a picture of Devī. For Durgāpūjā it is not absolutely necessary that there should be an image. Davi may be worshipped[^458] in a _liṅga_, on an altar or in a book, in her pādukās ( wooden or stone feet), in image, in a picture or a trident or sword or in water. Some of the purāṇas like Garuḍa and Bhaviṣya[^459] state that on the '7th or 8th tithi nine wooden houses or only one with four corners may be constructed, that in the midst of it a platform or altar of four cubits in length and breadth should be made on which a throne of silk, woollen cloth and deer-skin should be prepared, whereon Durgā ( image ) made of gold, silver, clay or wood was to be established having four or ten arms, possessing a complexion like heated gold, three eyes and the moon as a head ornament.

There is no unanimity about the arms of Devi, The Varāhapuraṇa (95.41) speaks of 20 arms of Devi and mentions the twenty weapons she carries (95.42-43). In the Devibhāgavata V.8.44 she is said to have 18 arms. Hemadri (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 923-924) quotes verses in which Devi is said to have eight arms and ten arms respectively. Vidyāpati[^460] quotes passages for both ten arms and eight arms. It appears that different numbers of arms were associated with different forms and names of Devi. For example, Vidyāpati in describing the form of Kāli or Cāmuṇḍa speaks of her as having four arms. In the Virāṭaparva (chap. 6) where Yudhiṣṭhira praises Durgā, she is described (in verse 8) as having four arms.

There are varying views about the word 'navarātra'. Some hold that navarātra means 'nine days and nights'; it signifies only the time for a vrata (i.e. it is a guṇavidhi), not the name of a rite (_karma_), while others contend that navarātra is the name of a rite or vrata, which may last for eight days ( if there is _tithikṣaya_) or ten days (if there is vṛddhi of a tithi from the first tithi to the 9th). The first view is held by works like the Kālatattvavivecana (pp. 270-272), while the 2nd is held by the Nirṇayasindhu[^461] (p. 165), the Puruṣārthacintāmaṇi (p. 61) and others. As the discussion is scholastic and hardly of any practical importance it is passed over here.

The principal matters in Navarātra or Durgāpūja, though it may be spread over three days ( from 7th tithi) or nine days (from 1st to 9th), are four as laid down by the Liṅgapuraṇa viz. _snāpana_ [^462] (bathing the image), puja, the offering of a victim (bali) and homa. For want of space snāpana has not been dwelt upon in the above. The Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 674). the Vrataraja (p. 340) and other digests state at length how the image of Durgā may be bathed with scented water, with milk, curds, ghee, _pañcagavya_ of a _kapilā_ cow, sugarcane juice and what rewards are reaped by particular kinds of baths. One example is given here for a sample.[^463] The man who even for a day bathes Caṇḍikā with pañcagavya to the accompaniment of Caṇḍigāyatri goes near Viṣṇu. If the image is made of some material (like clay) that cannot bear a water bath, the bright sword placed near Devi's image may be bathed or a mirror, as stated by the Kālikāpurāṇa. The other three out of the four principal items in Durgāpūjā have been dealt with above. Out of the four, pūjā is the most important and a fast is only an aṅga (ancillary matter).

This चण्डीगायत्री imitates the famous गायत्रीमन्त्र 'तत्सवितुः , &c. Ṛg. III.62.10.

Then the question arises as to when pūjā is to be performed. Here there are varying views. The Samaya-mayūkha [^464] (p. 14) quoting Devi-purāṇa appears to hold that the pūjā should be in the morning, while the Nirṇayasindhu (p. 165) holds that it should be at night. It appears from the Devi-purāṇa and Kālikāpurāṇa that pūjā in the morning, mid-day and at night is intended [^465] When the sun is in sign Virgo, the devotee should follow the method of _ayācita_ or _nakta_ or take food only once or subsist only on water beginning from the _nandikā_ tithi of the bright half, should bathe in the morning, should rise superior to the opposites (of heat and cold, happiness and pain &c.) and should worship (Śiva and) Śivā three times a day.' The Kālatattvavivecana [^466] resolves this conflict by saying that morning and midday _pūjās_ are brief, the principal and elaborate pūjā is at night only. There is some confusion caused by the texts laying down the nakṣatras, tithis or both on which the different items in the Durgāpūjā were to be performed.

The Kālaviveka quotes Vyāsa as follows: 'one should awaken Devī on Ārdrā nakṣatra, make her enter (the devotee's house) on Mūla, and having worshipped her on Uttarāsāḍhā should take leave of her on Śravaṇa'. [^467] Most digests refer only to the tithis. For example, we saw above (p. 159 note 411) that on the 7th tithi the bilva branch is to be brought to the house, on the 8th fast, pūjā and _jāgara_ are to be observed, the _bali_ is offered on 9th, and on the 10th _nirājana_ and discharging the Devi take place. Some texts combine the tithi and nakṣatra for the several parts of Durgāpūjā. For example, the Rājamārtaṇḍa verse (q. in n. 426 above) says 'one should, after propitiating with faith (Devi) by the head, flesh and blood of several kinds of animals, take leave of her on Śravaṇa-nakṣatra and 10th tithi'. The Devipurāṇa provides [^468] 'The bilva tree should be addressed with a mantra on 6th tithi joined to Jyesthā, (the sheaf of), plants should be brought into the house on the 7th joined to Mūla, fast, pūjā and homa take place on the 8th joined to Pūrvāsāḍhā, on the 9th joined to Uttarāṣāḍhā one should worship Durgā with animal sacrifices and after prostrating oneself before her leave should be taken of her on 10th tithi joined to Śravaṇa'. It often happened that the tithi and nakṣatra provided for an item did not tally and some rules were evolved. The first rule is: if both tithi and nakṣatra as provided tallied then that led to very good results, as said in the Lingapurāṇa 'even if there be no Mūlanakṣatra, one should enter the bilva branch in the house on the seventh; the same rule applies to other tithis, but if the nakṣatras exist on the tithis specified there is increase of the results or rewards.' The second rule was that _tithi_ was superior[^469] and therefore even if the nakṣatra did not exist on the tithi specified, one should follow the tithi laid down for the several items in Durgāpūjā. Devala and Lalla[^470] laid this down.

[^467]: आह व्यासः। आर्द्रायां बोधयेद्देवीं मूलेन तु प्रवेशयेत् । उत्तरेणार्चनं कृत्वा श्रवणेन विसर्जयेत् । का. वि. p. 511, व.क्रि. कौ. p. 375 (ascribes to नन्दिकेश्वरपुराण and reads पूर्वोत्तराम्यां संपूज्य ). The कालीविलासतन्त्र (30.6) has 'आर्द्रायां बोधयेद्देवीं मूलेनेव प्रवेशयेत् । पूर्वोत्तराम्यां सम्पूज्य श्रवणेन विसर्जयेत् ॥'. The बोधन on आर्दा refers to the 9th tithi of the dark half preceding the navarātra, Mūla refers to the 7th tithi when the bilva twig was to be brought to the house; Uttarāṣāḍhā and Śravaṇa would correspond to the 9th and 10 tithis respectively.

One question on which there is difference of view is about the tithi on which Navarātra is to be begun when pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā or dvitiya. There are very lengthy discussions in the Nirṇayasindhu, Kālatattvavivecana, Puruṣārtha-cintāmaṇi and other works. Some quote passages from the Devi and other purāṇas condemning the beginning of navarātra on pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā. Devi is made[^471] to say 'in my worship _pratipad_ which is joined to amāvāsyā should not be accepted; pratipad existing only for a muhūrta (two ghaṭikās) at sunrise and then joined to the 2nd tithi should be accepted ( for commencing Navarātra festival)'. On the other hand there[^471a] are texts like the following: if one were to accept for the (beginning of the ) worship of Caṇdikā pratipad joined to part of 2nd _tithi_ through ignorance or through another's advice, that leads to the death of that person's son. The Samayamayūkha says that both classes of texts are baseless or if they are authoritative they leave the matter undecided as they are opposed to each other. The decision has to be arrived at in a different manner. 'If pratipad is mixed with amāvāsyā but does not exist the next day, then it must be accepted for starting Navarātra as there is no other alternative. Therefore, even a pratipad mixed with amāvāsyā has to be accepted in such a case in spite of texts to the contrary'.

[^469]: दु. भ. त. p. 23 says 'तत्र क्वचित्तिथिकल्पः क्वचिनक्षत्रकल्पः, सति सम्भवे योग एवादरणीयः फलाधिक्यार्थः। केवलतिथिनक्षत्रयोस्तु तिथिरादरणीया न नक्षत्रं तिथेः प्राधान्यात्। यदाह ज्योतिःशास्र गर्गः । तिथिः शरीरं... विनेन्दुना नैव च कर्मसिद्धिः। ... देवलोप्याह । तिथिनक्षत्रयोर्योगेद्वयोरेवानुपालनम्। योगाभावे तिथिर्ग्राह्या देव्याः पूजनकर्मणि।। एवं प्रतिवर्षकर्तव्यत्वादार्द्रादिनक्षत्रालाभेपि पूजा कार्या नक्षत्रयोगस्तु फलातिशयाय। तथा च लिङ्गपुराणम् । मूलाभावेपि सप्तम्यां केवलायां प्रवेशयेत् । तथा तिथ्यन्तरेवेवमृक्षेषु तु फलोञ्जयः। ति. त. p. 74, व.क्रि. कौ. p. 368, का.त. वि. p. 374.

[^471a]: द्वितीया शेषसंयुक्ता प्रतिपञ्चण्डिकार्चने। मोहादथोपदेशद्वा कृतं पुत्रविनाशकम् । q. by स.म. p. 15.

If pratipad starts with sunrise and spreads over the next day for less than three muhurtas, then the full pratipad has to be accepted for beginning navarātra. If at first there is amāvāsyā for one muhūrta, then pratipad follows and then spreads over the next day up to less than three muhurtas, then this latter, that is, pratipad mixed with dvitīyā has to be accepted as the beginning. For want of space all possible alternatives are not dealt with here.

One important matter was not stressed above. On the first day of Navarātra one has to establish a _kalaśa_ or _ghaṭa_. A full kalaśa has been a symbol of holiness and prosperity from early Vedic times (compare Ṛg. III. 32.15 'āpūrṇo asya kalaśaḥ'). This is a rite which is performed in the Deccan, Gujarat and Saurāṣtra even though the elaborate Durgāpūjā of Bengal finds no place there. The procedure given in Durgābhaktitarangiṇi p. 3. Nirṇayasindhu (p. 767), Vratarāja (pp. 62–66), Puruṣārthacintīmaṇi (pp. 66-67) and other works is elaborate. Ghaṭasthāpana is spoken of in Durgārcanapaddhati (p. 663) and has to be performed by day and not at night. One should make [^472] an altar with holy clay and sow _yava_ and wheat grains thereon with Ṛg. X. 97. 22, and establish a jar there of gold, silver, copper or clay with Ṛg. IX. 17. 4, fill the jar with water with Ṛg. X. 75.5 (imam me Gaṅge &c.), and cast in the jar sandalwood paste, _sarvauṣadhi_[^473], dūrvā grass, leaves of five trees (mango &c.), clay from seven places, fruit, five jewels and gold with appropriate mantras, surround it with a piece of cloth with Ṛg. III. 8. 4, place a pūrṇa-pātra (a cup filled with rice grains) on the jar and worship Varuṇa thereon, contemplate on Durgā (as described in note 418) and invoke Durgā to come and be present in the jar along with all groups of gods and offer the upacāras from _pādya_ onwards, fold his hands, offer a prayer and boiled rice with _māṣa_ pulse or a kūṣmāṇda &c.

I p. 49 gives a somewhat different list 'कुष्ठं मांसी हरिद्रे द्वे मुरा शैलेयचन्दनम् । वचा चम्पकमुस्ते च सर्वोषध्यो दश स्मृताः॥

In the Deccan the main items in the Navarātra are the establishment of ghaṭa, offering a garland of flowers on every tithi up to the 9th, a strict code of conduct (such as not shaving oneself) to be observed by the performer. If on the pratipad day on which the jar is to be established there is citrā-nakṣatra [^474] and the astrological conjunction called Vaidhṛti, it is to be done at the end of these, but if these two exist the whole of the day, then the rite should be performed in the latter part of these two. The S. M. held that these texts were baseless. According to Ghosh (p. 76), in Bengal nine jars are established in a figure (_sarvatobhadra_) filled with coloured powders at prescribed places and these are decorated with nine differently coloured flags. But in some parts of India only one ghaṭa is established.

Hemādri (on Vrata, vol. I. p. 906 ) quotes Devipurāṇa for honouring horses[^475]. The Durgāpūjā was meant for all. Kings and such men as kept horses were advised to honour horses in Navarātra from the 2nd tithi in conjunction with Svāti-nakṣatra up to 9th tithi. The Durgābhaktitarangiṇi devotes several pages to this nirājana of horses from Śālihotra, Bhoja, Varāhamihira and other authorities (pp. 56-63 and 67-69). Kings were advised to perform Lohabhisārika rite about horses from Āśvinśukla first to Mahānavamı (H. V. I. 910-916, N. S. 178, R. N.P. 414-416). For Lohābhihārika or Nirājana rite, vide H. of Dh. Vol III. p. 230 notes 309-311 and p. 910 note 1773. Although the Kṛtyakalpataru (on vrata) does not speak of Durgotsava on the lines stated above, the Naiyatakālika section of that work (pp. 408-410) quotes a long passage from the Bhaviṣyapurāṇa[^476] which states that Mahiṣa was killed by Caṇḍikā and therefore she should be worshipped on _navami_, all varṇas should worship her, kings should fast on it and gifts should be made; the Devi is pleased by the offering of the devotee's own blood and flesh and of he-buffaloes, goats and rams. It specifies the periods for which gratification is felt by the Devi by the offering of various _balis_ and avers that all _dasyus_ and various mleccha tribes, the Aṅgas, Vaṅgas, Kaliṅgas, Kinnaras, Barbaras and Śakas worship her.

The Kr̥tyakalpataru on Vrata does contain a vrata called Durgāṣṭamivrata derived from the Devipurāṇa (pp. 225-233), but it has nothing to do with the exploits of Durgā.

Hemādri also (on vrata, vol. I. pp. 856-862) contains the same vrata with a few variations. That vrata is entirely different from the Durgotsava described in the Kālikāpurāṇa. In the first place there is no reference in it to the killing of Mahiṣāsura. In the next place, that vrata is described as beginning from the 8th of Śrāvaṇa-śukla and going on for one year in each succeeding month on the 8th of the bright half. Feeding virgins and brāhmaṇas is mentioned in it also, but in each month the food offered to Devi and to the virgins is generally different.

About the antiquity of the worship of Durgā, vide H. of Dh. Vol. II pp. 738–739. A few matters that were not and that could not be mentioned there are noted here. Ambikā is said to be the sister of Śiva in Tai.[^477] S., but in the times of the Tai. Ār. X 18 Śiva is said to be the husband of Ambikā or Uma. In the Vanaparva chap. 6 (where there is a long laud of Durgā [^478] by Yudhiṣṭhira), she is described as the daughter of Yaśodā and Nanda and as the sister of Vāsudeva, is addressed as Kāli, Mahākāli and Durgā, in verses 10-11 the weapons carried by her in her hands are mentioned and in verse 15 she is said to have destroyed Mahiṣāsura. When Arjuna (in Bhisma 23) offers a Durgāstotra at the bidding of Kṛṣṇa, he gives her several names, among which are Kumāri, Kāli, Kapāli, Kapilā, Bhadrakāli, Mahākāli, Caṇḍi, Kātyāyani, Kauśiki, Umā. But as the dates of these passages in the Mahābhārata are far from certain no chronological conclusion can be stated.

[^477]: आखुस्ते रुद्र पशुस्तं जुषस्वैष ते रुद्र भागः सह स्वस्नाम्बिकया तं जुषस्व । ते. सं. I. 8, 6. 1, (सायण explains भगिनीवद्धित्तकारिण्या); vide तै. बा. I. 6. 10.4 शरद्वा अस्याम्बिका स्वसा तया वा एष हिनास्ति. ते. आ. x. 18 is 'नमो हिरण्यवाहवे हिरण्यपतयेऽम्बिकापतय उमापतये नमो नमः'॥

[^478]: दुर्गात्तारयसे दुर्गे तत् त्वं दुर्गा स्मृता जनैः । विराट 6, 20. Panini ( IV. 1. 49) mentions Bhavani the wife of Bhava (i.e, Rudra). Why अम्बिका is called कौशिकी is stated in मार्कण्डेय chap. 82. 43 'शरीरकोशाद्यत्तस्याः पार्वत्या निःसुताम्बिका कौशिकीति समस्तेषु ततो लोकेषु गीयते'॥

Literary works and coins supply some firm data about the antiquity of the Durgā cult. In the Raghuvaṁśa chap. II a lion is said to have been appointed a guard to protect a _devadārū_ (pine) tree planted by Pārvati. Pārvati is called Gauri in Raghu. II. 26 and in Kumārasambhava. VII. 95 and Bhavāni in Kumārao (VII. 84), Caṇḍi in Meghadūta (I. 33). Similarly, in the Kumārasambhava the Ardhanārīśvara form of Śiva is mentioned.[^479] The mātr̥s are referred to in the same work (VII. 30, 38) and also Kāli with skulls as ornaments (ibid. VII. 39). In the Mālati-mādhava (Act V) the offering of human victims to Cāmuṇḍā in the city of Padmavati is mentioned. In the Mr̥cchakaṭika VI. 27 the legend of the killing of Śumbha and Niśumbha by Durgā occurs. If we hold that Kālidāsa flourished between 350-450 A. D., the above evidence makes it quite probable that the worship of Durgā may go back some centuries before 300 A. D. The evidence of coins lends support to this conclusion. A _siṁhavāhini_ goddess is seen on the reverse of the coins of Candragupta I of the Gupta [^480] dynasty (about 305-325 A. D.). "On a coin of the late Kuṣāṇa king Kaneshko the reverse shows the figure of a goddess with a lunar crescent seated full face on a lion crouching left and the godddess appears to have a noose and sceptre.[^481] The lion as vehicle and the noose indicate that the goddess should be Durgā and not Lakṣmi. This would take us to the first or 2nd century A. D.

Why two Navarātras were recognized (in Caitra and Āśvina) is a matter of conjecture. It is possible that these two pūjās arose from the fact that spring crops and autumn crops became ready at these two times. The worship of Durgā was very much influenced by Śākta doctrines and practices. Ghosh in his work on 'Durgāpūjā' (p. XVI ff.) tries to establish that the Vedic idea of Dawn (Uṣas) spreading over the sky was changed by the Puraṇas and Tantras into the terrific goddess Durgā. I am not prepared to accept this explanation at all, as the links between the Vedic goddess Dawn and the terrible goddess of the Kālikā-purāṇa are altogether wanting and as there is a gap of many centuries between the disappearance of Uṣas from the ancient pantheon and popular worship and the emergence of Durgā. There may be some astrological connection between Durgā ( Virgo ) riding a lion (Leo). But this also cannot be clearly made out.

In the Indian Historical Quarterly vol. 21 (pp. 227–231 ) Mr. N. G. Banerjee refers to the Durgotsava-paddhati of Udaya simha which begins with the Mahānavami and a saṅkalpa for victory and ends with the description of horses marching on _daśami_ to victory and avers that this work indicates that Durgāpūjā was originally a military rite and was later on transformed into a religious festival. He relies upon the description in the Raghuvaṁśa (IV. 24-25) how the advent of Sarad (autumn) season impelled Raghu to march on an invasion and to perform the _śānti_ rite for horses called Aśvanīrājana and also on the Br̥hatsamhitā. chap. 44 (Kern's ed.) where occurs an elaborate description of the nirājana of horses, elephants and fighters on the 8th, 12th, or 15th of the bright half of Āśvina or Kārtika. There are serious objections against accepting this theory. It is not unknown that unconnected celebrations may be joined together on the same tithi or tithis. For example, in many parts of North India the Rāmalīlā festival for ten days is associated with Navarātra days. But Navarātra and Rāmalila are independent of each other and in some parts even of North India, only one or the other is popular and celebrated and not both. There is nothing improbable in there being two occasions for nirājana, one in Durgotsava and another on the occasion of a king's march on an invasion. Besides, a work of the 15th century can hardly be relied upon as evidence for explaining the origin of a festival that was in vogue for about a thousand years at least before that work. Moreover, if it was the usage to celebrate the marching on an invasion in Āśvina with nirājana (lustration), that rite might have been borrowed from that in Durgotsava by analogy instead of the utsava having adopted the military usage. The Kālikā-purāṇa which describes at length Durgotsava also speaks of the nirājana in Āśvinaśukla on the 8th and the worship of a noble handsome horse for seven days with sandalwood paste, flowers &c. and requires the observation of the horse's movements for drawing prognostications (chap. 88.15–75). There is nothing to show that the details of Durgotsava described in the Kālikā and other purāṇas did not exist in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries A. D. when Kālidāsa and Varāhamihira flourished and mentioned the lustration of horses. The theory of Mr. N. G. Banerjee appears to be unwarranted by the evidence so far available and cannot be accepted.
