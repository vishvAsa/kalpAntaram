Until quite recently, it was Vamana-centric.

The association of Oṇam with Bali is a recent (post 17th-century) phenomenon.
The celebration on Oṇam that is mentioned in the Maturaikkāñci, the poems of the Tamil Āḻvārs, etc. was  in honor of Māyōṉ/Viṣṇu (i.e. Vāmana) and, more specifically, Vāmana's birth on Śrāvaṇa Dvādaśī  under the asterism Śroṇā. 

As per the Purāṇas, it is actually Bali/Dyūta/Govardhana Pratipadā (Kārttika Śukla Pratipadā) which commemorates the return of Bali.

The original celebration of Oṇam as the birth/incarnation of Vāmana is still followed in the Tṛkkākkara Vāmana temple.
