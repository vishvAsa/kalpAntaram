KĀLA, MUHŪRTA, the influence of Astrology on DHARMASĀSTRA and CALENDAR

CHAPTER XIV

Conception of Kāla

Among the first of the great problems of philosophy is that of the nature of Space (_dik_) and Time (_kāla_).

The questions that arise are: Are Space and Time ultimately real? Is the world we apprehend spaceless and timeless or has the universe a beginning in time; are Space and Time themselves things or real attributes or relations of things. Great divergence of views has prevailed on these problems from ancient times to this day. It is therefore advisable to indicate briefly the speculations on Time contained principally in Sanskrit works.

The word Kāla occurs only once in the Ṛgveda [^651] as a gambler collects the _kṛta_ (highest stake ) at the (proper) time' (Ṛg. X. 42. 9, Kṛtam yac śvaghni vicinoti kāle'). The Atharvaveda contains two hymns (XIX. 53. 1-10 and XIX. 54, 1-5) embodying a most sublime conception of Kāla. A few striking verses[^652] are translated here: Kāla (Time) carries (as) a horse with seven reins, thousand-eyed, ageless, endowed with plentiful seed (power); the wise poets mount him (as one mounts a chariot); all worlds are his wheels (53.1); he ( Kāla) himself brought together the worlds and he himself went round (all) worlds together; being the father, he became the son of them (worlds ); there is indeed no other brilliance that is higher (or beyond) him (53.4); in Time is mind, in Time is breath; in Time is placed name; all these beings are glad by time when it arrives (53.7); Time created beings; in the beginning Kāla (created) Prajāpati; the self-existent Kaśyapa sprang from Kāla and (so did) _tapas_ spring from Kāla (53. 10); Kāla, the son, created past and the future, from Time arose the ṛk (verses) and the _yajus_ ( sacrificial formulas) were born from time (54, 3); this world and the highest world, holy worlds and holy _vidhṛtis_ having completely conquered these worlds by the _brahman_; Time goes on (abides) as the highest god' (54. 5).

[^651]: Compare कृतं न श्वघ्नी विचिनोति देवने। ऋ. x. 43 5 ( = अथर्व. xx. 17.5) with ऋ. x. 42.9 ( = अथर्व. VII. 50.6 and xx. 89.9 कृतमिव श्वघ्नी विचिनोति काले); vide also ' श्वघ्नीव यो जिगीवाल्ँलक्षमादत् । ऋ II. 12.4; Ṛg. x. 43.5 is explained by Chan. Up IV. 1.4 'यथा कृताय विजितायाधरेयाः संयन्ति.' ('as the lower throws of dice all go to the highest throw, to the winner'.

[^652]: कालो अश्वो वहति सप्तरश्मिः सहस्राक्षो अजरो भूरिरेताः। तमा रोहन्ति कवयो विपश्चितस्तस्य चक्रा भुवनानि विश्वा ॥ स एव सं भुवनान्याभरत् स एव सं भुवनानि पर्येत् । पिता सन्नभवत्पुत्र एषां तस्माद्वै नान्यत्परमस्ति तेजः॥ काले मनः काले प्राणः काले नाम समाहितम् । कालेन सर्वा नन्दन्त्यागतेन प्रजा इमाः॥ कालः प्रजा असृजत कालो अग्रे प्रजापतिम् । स्वयम्भूः कश्यपः कालात्तपः कालादजायत । अथर्व. XIX. 53.1, 4, 7, 10; कालो ह भूतं भव्यं च पुत्रो अजनयत्पुरा। कालादृचः समभवन्यजुः कालादजायत ॥ इमं च लोकं परमं च लोकं पुण्यांश्च लोकान् विधृतीश्च पुण्याः। सर्वाल्लोकानभिजित्य ब्रह्मणा कालः स ईयते परमो नु देवः ॥ अथर्व. XIX. 54. 5. कश्यप is styled a ऋषि in ऋ. IX. 114.2 and is in later mythology the husband of अदिति who is called mother, father and son in ऋ. I. 89.10; so probably कश्यप here is the same as प्रजापति. In अथर्व. VIII. 5.14 कश्यप is said to have created the amulet jewel 'कश्यपस्त्वामसृजत कश्यपस्त्वा समैरयत्'. विधृति probably means here 'boundaries separating the worlds'.

From these passages it appears that the word Kāla was used even in very early Vedic times in two senses, viz. time in general ( as in modern Sanskrit and modern Indian languages ) and Time as identical with the Supreme Being or the source of Creation. This latter sense, it will be shown a little later on, is also emphasized in many Sanskrit works (including the Purāṇas ).

In the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa the word Kāla is often used in the sense of time' or 'proper time '[^653] e.g. ‘he (Rudra angry because he was excluded from a share in offerings ) flew up towards the north at the time when _sviṣṭakṛt_ offering was to be made' (1. 7. 3. 3 ); Prajāpati ( when cattle approached him) said 'whenever you may get anything at the (proper) time or at an improper time you may eat it'( II. 4. 2. 4).

A few passages from some of the Upaniṣads regarded as ancient by most scholars may be cited here; the Chān. Up. II. [^654] 31. 1 (while speaking of Vāmadevya Sāman and its parts ) uses the word Kāla as equal to 'end' or 'finish'. The Br. [^655] Up. I. 2.4 says "He desired 'would that a second self of me were produced' ... He bore him for a time as long as a year; after that long time he brought him forth". In the dialogue between Gārgya and king Ajātaśatru in the same Upaniṣad Gārgya put forward several objects which he reverenced (_upāsana_) as _brahma_ when the king replied as to those cases in these words. '_prāṇa_ ( breath ) does not leave him before the time' and 'death does not come to him before time'. Here the word 'Kāla' is used in the sense of proper or appointed time'.

[^653]: स आयततयोत्तरत उपोत्पेदे य एष स्विष्टकृतः कालः। शत. बा. I. 7 3 3; यदैव यूयं कदा च लभाध्यै यदि काले यद्यनाकालेऽथैवाश्नाथेति ॥ II. 4. 2.4.

[^654]: कालं गच्छति तन्निधनं पारं गच्छति तन्निधनमेतद्वामदेव्यं मिथुने प्रोतम्। छा. उप. II. 13 1.

[^655]: सोऽकामयत द्वितीयो म आत्मा जायेतेति ... न पुरा ततः संवत्सर आस तमेतावन्तं कालमबिभः । यावान्संवसरः। तमेतावतः कालस्य परस्तादसृजत । बृह. उप. I. 2.4, नैनं पुरा कालात् प्राणो जहाति। ...नैनं पुरा कालान्मृत्युरागच्छति । बृह. II. 1. 20 and 21; नो एवं स्वयं नास्य प्रजा पुरा कालात्संमोहमेति । ...नो एव स्वयं नास्य प्रजा पुरा कालात्प्रमीयते । कोषी. उप. IV. 12 and 13.

## Kāla in the Upaniṣads

In the passage of the Kauṣitaki Br. that corresponds to Br. Up. II. 1.10 and 12 the words are 'neither he himself nor his progeny pass into unconsciousness before the time' and 'neither he nor his progeny dies before the time'. In some passages of the Śvetāśvatara Up. some thinkers are stated to have put forward Kāla as the cause or source of creation e. g.'what is the cause ? [^656] Is it Brahma? Whence are we born? Whereby do we live? On what are we established (or where are we going?)... Time or inherent nature or necessity or chance or elements or _yoni_ (prakṛti) or the person, it is to be considered ( whether one of these is cause )'; 'Some sages discourse upon inherent nature ( as the cause ) while other deluded persons speak of Time ( as the cause ).' Here Kāla is represented as the cause of creation, which is the 2nd meaning of the word Kāla set out from the Atharvaveda. In another passage [^657] of the same Up. Kāla is said to have been generated by Him who is intelligent and omniscient. The first meaning of Kāla ( time in general) is also found in Śvetāśvatara Up. 'He (God) is the beginning, the efficient cause of (all) combinations, He is beyond the three times and is also without parts'. The Mānḍūkyopaniṣad avers that Omkāra is beyond the threefold time viz. past, present and future.

[^656]:  किं कारणं ब्रह्म कुतः स्म जाता जीवाम केन क्व च संप्रतिष्ठाः । ...कालः स्वभावो नियतिर्यदृच्छा भूतानि योनिः पुरुष इति चिन्त्यम् । श्वे. उप. I. 1-2; स्वभावमेके कवयो वदन्ति कालं तथान्ये परिमुह्यमानाः। श्वे. उप. VI. 1. The बृहत्संहिता of वराह appears to refer to this last when it says (in I. 7) 'कालं कारणमेके स्वभावमपरे परे जगुः कर्म'.

[^657]:  येनावृतं नित्यमिदं हि सर्वज्ञः कालकारो गुणी सर्वविद्यः । श्वे. उप. VI. 2; आदिः स संयोगनिमित्तहेतुः परस्त्रिकालादकालोपि दृष्टः । श्वे. उप. VI. 5; compare माण्डक्याप. 'भूतं भवद्भविष्यमिति सर्वमोङ्कार एव । यच्चान्यत्त्रिकालातीतं तदप्योङ्कार एव'।.

The Maitri Upaniṣad [^658] has a long but somewhat rambling disquisition on time ( VI. 14-16 ). It first says "Then it has been said elsewhere 'Food is indeed the source of this whole world, and time of food; the Sun is the source of time'. Then a little later on it proceeds "Thus one has said 'From Time flow beings, from Time they reach growth, and in Time they come to disappear; Time is a form (i.e. has definite shape or limits ) and is (also ) formless". Then it propounds "There are indeed two forms of _brahma_, Time and Timeless. That which is prior to the Sun is Timeless ( form of Brahma) and it is without parts, But that which begins with the Sun is Time that has parts; year is the form of the Time that has parts. All these beings are produced from the year, through the year these beings when born grow, and they disappear in the year. Therefore the year is Prajāpati, is time, is food, is Brahma nest (or abode ) and is Ātman. And it has been said "Time cooks ( ripens or digests ) all beings in the Great Self; that man knows the ( real import of) Veda who knows that in which Time is cooked". Here the Maitri Up. speaks of Time in its two senses, contains the germ of the later conception of the experience of Time as due to the actions or movements of the Sun, and refers to Time in the same terms in which the Tai. Up. (III. 1) speaks of _brahma_. It is unnecessary to set out passages from other Upaniṣads such as the Mahānārāyaṇa (XI, 14 aham-eva kālo nāham kālasya ) where Kāla is identified with God ( Nārāyaṇa ).[^659]


[^658]: अथान्यत्राप्युक्तं अन्नं वा अस्य सर्वस्य योनिः कालश्चान्नस्य सूर्यो योनिः कालस्य । ... एवं ह्याह । कालात्स्रवन्ति भूतानि कालद् वृद्धिं प्रयान्ति च । काले चास्तं नियच्छन्ति कालो मूतिरमूर्तिमान् ॥ द्वे वाव ब्रह्मणो रूपे कालश्वाकालश्चाथ यः प्रागादित्यासोऽकालोऽकलोऽथ य आदित्याद्यः स कालः सकलः सकलस्य वा एतद्रूपं यत्संवत्सरः संवत्सरात्खल्विमाः प्रजाः प्रजायन्ते संवत्सरेणेह वै जाता विवर्धन्ते संवत्सरे प्रत्यस्तं यन्ति तस्मात्संवत्सरो वै प्रजापतिः कालोऽन्नं ब्रह्मनीड मात्मा चेत्येवं ह्याह । कालः पचति भूतानि सर्वाण्येव महात्मनि । यस्मिंस्तु पच्यते कालो यस्तं वेद स वेदवित् ॥ मैत्री. VI, 14-15. With कालात्स्रवन्ति etc. and संवत्सरात्खल्विमाः etc. compare 'यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते येन जातानि जीवन्ति यत्प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति ॥ तद्वि जिज्ञासस्व तद् ब्रह्मेति।। तै. उप. III. 1.

[^659]: कालः सृजति भूतानि कालः संहरते प्रजाः। संहरन्तं प्रजाः कालं कालः शमयते पुनः॥ कालो हि कुरुते भावान् सर्वलोके शुभाशुभान् । कालः संक्षिपते सर्वाः प्रजा विसृजते पुनः॥ कालः सुप्तेषु जागर्ति कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः । आदिपर्व 1. 248-250; कालः पचति भूतानि कालः संहरते प्रजाः । कालः सुप्तेषु जागर्ति कालो हि दुरतिक्रमः ॥ स्त्रीपर्व 2.24. The words कालो... क्रमः occur in शान्ति. 221. 41 and गरुड I. 108.7.

##Kāla in Mahābhārata

The Mahābhārata recurs to the theme of Kāla time and again. In the Ādiparva it is said "Kāla creates beings and Kāla destroys people; Kāla extinguishes Kāla that is engaged in destroying people; Kāla brings about good or evil states (or things); Kāla reduces all people and again sends them forth; Kāla is (the only one) awake when all are asleep (i.e. dead or liberated); for Kāla is invincible". The Strīparva has the following ‘Kāla cooks all beings and Kāla destroys people; Kāla is invincible'. The Śāntiparva [^660] in chapters 221 and 227 contains a long disquisition on the formidable influence of Kāla on all including gods like Indra. In the śāntiparva it is asserted 'beyond the mind is the Great Intelligence and beyond the latter, is the Great Time; beyond Time is the adorable Viṣṇu to whom belongs the whole world'. In another place the Śāntiparva, after detailing nineteen _guṇas_ the last being _dvandvayoga_ (pairs of opposites such as pleasure and pain), remarks that the 20th guṇa beyond the nineteenth is Kāla and that one should know these twenty to be the source and end of all beings, The Āśvamedhika-parva describes (chap. 45) the wheel of Time in an elaborate metaphorical way (verses 1-9) and remarks that the man who well knows the action of Kāla and its sublation is never deluded and reaches the highest goal. In Vanaparva Kṛṣṇa is identified with Brahma, Rudra, the Sun, the Moon, Dharma, Yama, Kāla &c. Vide for further references Śāntiparva 25. 5 ff, 224-225.

In the Bhagavadgītā the word kāla is used in the sense of 'time in general or proper time' in several passages (such as IV.2, VIII. 7 and 27, VIII. 23, XVII. 20 ) and Kāla is identified with Kṛṣṇa as Supreme Lord in one of his super-eminent manifestations in X. 30 and 33 (I am Kāla among those that seize and I am Kāla that is imperishable) and XI. 32 (I am Kāla, that has increased (in strength) and that brings about the destruction of the worlds ).

Pāṇini employs the word kāla in his sūtras many times, but in the sense of time in general or the divisions of time or proper time. Patañjali on Pāṇini III. 3. 167 ( Kālasamayavelāsu tumun) quotes a half verse about Kāla, which is the same as the one quoted above from the Mahābhārata (in note [^659] ) and which appears to have been cited by Patañjali as a well-known verse. In another place Patañjali while explaining Vārtika 2 on Pāṇini (II, 2.5) states a very important theory about Kāla.

[^660]: मनसो महती बुद्धिर्बुद्धेः कालो महान् स्मृतः। कालात् स भगवान् विष्णुर्यस्य सर्वमिदं जगत् ॥ शान्तिपर्व 206.13. ( = cr. ed. 199. 11); ऊर्घ्व चैकोनविंशत्या कालो नामापरोगुणः । इतीमं विद्धि विंशत्या भूतानां प्रभवाप्ययम् । शान्ति 320.108-109; सर्वं नारायणो भूत्वा हरिरासीः परन्तप । ब्रह्मा सोमश्च सूर्यश्च धर्मो धाता यमोऽनलः। वायुर्वेश्रवणो रुद्रः कालः खंपृथिवी दिशः । वनपर्व 12. 21-22; कालः कलयतामहम् । गीता x. 30 (here the word काल is derived from the root कल् 10th conj. to compute, to grasp).

He says [^661] "People speak of that as Kāla whereby the increases (or growths) and decreases in solid bodies are observed and the same (time) is called day and night when conjoined with some activity. What is that activity? (the reply is): the motion of the Sun. When that (motion of the Sun) is repeated again and again there is a month and a year". This means that Kāla does not exist except as a convenient name or word for the manner of measuring change or becoming in what we observe by comparing one series of changes with another.

In the Manusmr̥ti the Supreme [^662] Lord is said to have created time and its divisions (I. 24 Kālam Kālavibhaktiśca) and to have, after He produced the universe, disappeared in himself again and again, squeezing one period of time by means of another period (I. 51).

Coming to the philosophical systems, it may be noted that the Sāṅkhya system does not include Kāla as a separate _tattva_ in its twenty-five tattvas. But Kāla was not altogether forgotten in that system. The Sāṅkhyakārika [^663] states that the _karaṇas_ are thirteen, three being _ābhyantara_ (internal i.e. inside the body ) and ten being _bāhya_; the latter are concerned with the present, while the former are concerned with the three times (past, present and future).

[^661]: येन मूर्तीनामुपचयाश्चापचयाश्च लक्ष्यन्ते तं कालमाहुः । तस्यैव हि कयाचिक्रियया युक्तस्याहरिति च भवति रात्रिरिति च । कया क्रियया। आदित्यगत्या । तयैवासकृदावृत्तया मास इति भवति संवत्सर इति च । महाभाष्य on वार्तिक 2 on पाणिनि II. 2 5 'कालाः परिमाणिना' (Kielhorn's ed. vol. I. p. 409.).

[^662]: आत्मन्यन्तर्दधे भूयः कालं कालेन पीडयन् ॥ मनु. I. 51, The idea is that creation is destroyed by the time of pralaya, as Kullika says 'सृष्टिकालं प्रलयकालेन नाशयन्.'

[^663]: अन्तःकरणं त्रिविधं दशधा बाह्यं त्रयस्य विषयारव्यम्। साम्प्रतकालं बाह्यं त्रिकालमाम्यन्तरं करणम् ॥ सांख्यकारिका 133. The सांख्यतत्त्वकोमुदीof वाचस्पति explains 'अन्तः करणं त्रिविधं बुद्धिरहङ्कारो मन इति । शरीराभ्यन्तरवर्तित्वादन्तःकरणम्। ... तत्र बुद्धीन्द्रि याण्यालोचनेन कर्मेन्द्रियाणि तु यथास्वं व्यापारेण ।' (Nirn, ed. 1940) p. 372.

## Kāla in Vaiśeșika system

The Vaiśeṣika-sūtra treats [^664] Kāla as included in the nine dravyas ( substances, I. 5) and states that the indications of the existence of Kāla are the apprehensions of a thing as posterior or prior, the apprehension of simultaneity of certain things, the apprehension of a thing as lasting long or as being momentary, that it is _nitya_, one and the (efficient) cause of all things that are created. Praśastapāda gives the instance of an old man and a young man being seen by a person in one place and direction or in different directions, who apprehends after looking at a young man that another man called old differs from a young man as regards a grown-up moustache or beard, wrinkles on the body and baldness and so apprehends that the old man is remote from the young man and therefore apprehends him as beyond (_para_) while he thinks of the young man as near, posterior and so _apara_.

There were certain philosophers who held that Time is either past or future and denied that there is present time (vartamāna). The Nyāyasūtra refutes this view and holds that time is either past, present or future (II. 1. 39-43). From Patañjali's [^665] Mahābhāṣya it appears that even in his day there were philosophers that held that there was no time called present and that those people quoted certain verses in support.

The Nyāyamañjari [^666] of Jayantabhatta (K. S. S. 1936 ) has a long discussion on Kāla. It first sets out the views of those who deny the very existence of Kāla as a separate entity. These latter say that Kāla is not perceptible like a jar &c. and that the ideas of quickness or slowness depend merely on the observed effects.

[^664]: द्रव्य is one of the seven (in ancient times six ) पदार्थs. पदार्थ means any object that can be named and is known and not merely things that are physically apprehended. अपरस्मिन्नपरं युगपच्चिरं क्षिप्रमिति कालाङ्गानि । द्रव्यत्व नित्यत्वे वायुना व्याख्याते तत्त्वंभावेन । नित्येष्वभावादनित्येषु भावात्कारणे कालाख्येति। वैशेषिकसूत्र II. 2 6-9. प्रशस्तपाद comments in his भाष्य as follows : 'कालः परापरव्यतिकरयौगपद्यायौगपद्यचिरक्षिप्रप्रत्ययलिङ्गम् ।। p. 26 and 'कालकृतयोः (परत्वापरत्वयोः) कथम् । वर्तमानकालयोरनियतदिग्देशसंयुक्तयोर्युवस्थविरयो रूढश्मश्रुकार्कश्यवलिपलितादिसान्निध्ये सत्येकस्य द्रष्टुर्युवानमवधिं कृत्वा स्थविरे विप्रकृष्टा बुद्धिरुत्पद्यते । ततस्तामपेक्ष्य परेण कालप्रदेशेन संयोगात् परत्वस्योत्पत्तिः । pp. 77-78. The न्यायवार्तिक on न्यायसूत्र II. 1. 36 (p. 255 ) remarks 'यथैकस्मिन् पुरुषे अनेकसम्बन्धभेदानुविधायिन्यभिन्ने पिता पुत्रो भ्रातेति प्रत्यया भवन्ति तद्वदेकः कालः कार्यकारणविशेषापेक्षः परापरादिप्रत्ययहेतुरिति । एवमुप पादितः कालः'।

[^665]: अपर आह नास्ति वर्तमानः काल इति । अपि चात्र श्लोकानुदाहरन्ति । ...अपर आह । अस्ति वर्तमानः काल इति। आदित्यगतिवन्नोपलभ्यते। महाभाष्य on वार्तिक 4 (सन्ति च कालविभागाः । on पा. III. 2 123 वर्तमाने लट् ).

[^666]: अत्र चोदयन्ति । काले सति त्रैकाल्यं चिन्त्यम् । स एव तु दुरुपपादः, तदभावे कस्य वर्तमानादिविभागो निरूप्यते । न तावद् गृह्यते कालः प्रत्यक्षेण घटादिवत् । चिरक्षिप्रादिबोधोपि कार्यमात्रावलम्बनः ॥ ...यदि त्वेको विभुर्नित्यः कालो द्रव्यात्मनो मतः । अतीतवर्तमानादि भेदव्यवहृतिः कुतः । एवमाक्षिप्ते सति, प्रत्यक्षगम्यतामेव केचित्कालस्य मन्यते । विशेषणतया कार्य प्रत्यये प्रतिभासनात् ॥ क्रमेण युगपत्क्षिप्रचिरात्कृतमितीदृशः। प्रत्यया नावकल्पन्ते कार्वमात्राव लम्बनाः॥ अनुमेय एव कालः । अप्रत्यक्षत्वमात्रेण न च कालस्य नास्तिता। युक्ता पृथिव्यधोभाग चन्द्रमापरभागवत् ॥ तस्मादस्ति युगपदादिव्यवहारहेतुः कालः। तस्मादेकोप्ययं काल क्रियाभेदाद विभिद्यते ॥ न्यायमञ्जरी (K. S S., 1936) pp. 123-127.

The same theorists raise the further objection that if Kāla is a _dravya_ (substance) that is all-pervading and permanent, as the Vaiśeṣikas assert, then how is it that Kāla is spoken of as past, present and future. To these objections some reply: Kāla is directly perceived, since it appears to the mind as distinguishing the various perceptions of effects, that the several experiences such as 'these matters happened simultaneously, this happened after long, this happened quickly' cannot be perfectly explained if one denies the existence of Kāla and holds that these experiences depend solely on the perceived objects or actions. Others hold that Kāla is really inferred and not directly perceived. They argue: merely because Kāla is not directly perceived it does not follow that it does not exist; to infer that Kāla exists is proper as it is proper to infer that the other side of the moon exists though we see only that face of the moon that is below the earth; therefore Kāla exists as a separate entity to which is due the common experience of simultaneity, quickness or slowness &c. The differing observations about persons being young or old cannot be well explained without admitting the existence of Kāla, which like _ākāśa_ is one, all-pervading and permanent. To the objection how, if Kāla is one, all-pervading and _nitya_, it is spoken of as having three divisions, the reply is: in reality there are no divisions in Kāla, but divisions are imagined in Kāla on account of the _upādhi_ (a limiting or restrictive adjunct ) viz. _kriyā_ (activity ). When we speak of a man as cooking rice in the present (_odanam pacati_), that is due to the distinguishing nature of the result (boiled rice) which is brought about by several activities (_kriyās_) beginning with the placing of the cooking pot on the fire up to its being taken down on the ground. Then we use the word 'present'. But when we bear in mind the series of activities that produced the boiled rice we use the expression 'he cooked' ( in the past tense ) for the activities that have ended. In this way we speak of time also as past on account of the distinguishing characteristic of the activities that have ended.

It may be noted that Raghunātha on 'Padārtha-nirūpaṇa' (a work of Navyanyāya school) held the view that Space, Time and God are all one and the same thing and not separate substances. [^667]

[^667]: Vide Prof. Ingall's 'Materials for the study of Navyanyāya' (Harvard) p. 38 n. 36.

## Kāla in Yogasūtrabhāeya

In the Yogasūtrabhāṣya on III. 51 there is a brief but very interesting and abstruse disquisition on Kāla. The sūtra runs [^667a] 'by constraint (_saṁyama_) upon moments (kṣaṇa) and their sequence ( or succession) (arises) knowledge due to discrimination'. The bhāṣya explains : just as an atom is substance or matter (_dravya_) reaching the limit of minuteness, so a _kṣaṇa_ (moment) is time that reaches the highest limit of minuteness, or a kṣaṇa (moment) is time taken by an atom in leaving the position in space it occupies or the time taken in reaching the next point in space; _krama_ ( sequence) is the non-cessation of the flow of moments; moments and their succession do not form a collection ( or combination) of actual (or perceptible) things. Muhūrta ( 30th part of day and night ), day and night and others are combinations made by the mind (or by mental conceptions). This time, though devoid of being a real thing by itself, is indeed only a creation of mental conceptions and results from knowledge derived from words ( alone ) and appears as if it were an actual object to ordinary people whose doctrines are divergent (or confused ). But kṣaṇa (moment) falling among (i.e. being mixed up with ) real perceptible things appears ( to the human mind) as dependent on or constituting sequence (or succession ). _Krama_ (sequence) is of the nature of uninterrupted succession. This sequence is called Kāla by Yogins who know (the real nature of ) time. For, two kṣaṇas cannot exist together (simultaneouly). It is impossible that there should be a sequence of two moments that exist simultaneously. When a later moment comes after an earlier one without interruption, that is called _krama_. In the present there is only one moment and there are no earlier and later moments in the present. Therefore there can be no combination of two moments (in reality ). But those moments that have passed away and those that are yet to come are to be interpreted or described as connected with the ( constant) flux of changes (in the world). Therefore the whole world experiences change in each single moment. So all these ( external) aspects of the world are dependent on one moment ( in the present).

This disquisition shows that the Yogasutra and its bhāṣya held that time was not a _dravya_ and not a tangible reality, but that it was merely a word, a mental concept inseparable from the perception or experience of physical objects as a characteristic (viśesaṇa or upādhi), that it attaches itself to the changing realities, that we measure it according to the movements of or changes in things and that it was not merely like a hare's horn.

I have confined myself to Sanskrit works and particularly to works of the Vedic school type[^668]. Buddhist and Jaina thinkers had to say a good deal on Kāla. For example, the Pramāṇa[^669]-vārtika-bhāṣya or Vārtikālaṅkāra of Prajñākaragupta (about 700 A. D.) combats the view of the Vaiśesikasūtra and Praśastapāda ( quoted above) and holds that there is no separate entity like Kāla, that it is not possible to have the ideas of distant time and near time if Kāla be without beginning and be endless, that the ideas of being distant or near or quick are not distinct from the activities about which they are predicated. This Buddhist view practically amounts to saying that time is not a thing, but only an idea, only a subjective condition of human sensorial experiences and intuitions and is non-existent in itself, apart from the subject. On the other hand Jaina[^670] writers hold that there are six _padārthas_ viz. jiva, dharma, adharma, ākāśa, _pudgala_ and kāla i.e, Time has separate existence.

[^668]: It is surprising that in the two volumes of the 'History of philosophy, Eastern and Western,' published under the auspices of the Govt. of India (London, 1952), and compiled by an Editorial Board presided over by such a world-famous philosopher as Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, not a word is said about the conception of Time in the Vedic Literature and in the Vaiśeșika and other systems and only a meagre account is given of the Buddhist and Jain ideas on the subject (vol I. pp. 159, 175–76 and p. 144).

## Kāla in the Purāṇas

Some of the Purāṇas contain disquisitions on Kāla. The nature of Time is described in the Kūrmapurāṇa as follows: This adorable [^671] Kāla is without beginning and without end, it is ageless and immortal; it is a great Lord because it is all-embracing, it is independent and is the self of all; there may be many Brahmās, Rudras and Nārāyaṇas and other gods. It is declared that the divine Lord is one and is omniscient and is Kāla; they ( the gods) are created by Kāla, which again swallows (or makes them disappear); the gods Brahmā, Narayaṇa and Īśa (Śiva ) are said to undergo _prākr̥ta_ disappearance by the power of Kāla and also spring again therefrom as highest Brahma, the elements, Vāsudeva and Śhaṅkara. Therefore the whole world has its soul in Kāla. 'He alone is the highest Lord.' The Viṣṇudharmottara [^672] has a similar long disquisition on Kāla the gist of a few verses of which may be set out here 'Kāla is without beginning and without end, it is Rudra that seizes all (or it is Saṅkarṣana); it is called Kāla because it carries off or drives all beings. Kāla is great and the highest Lord, because it is beginningless and endless; it is more subtile than the winking of one's eye, very much more subtile than the subtilest. Its subtileness cannot be understood even by Yogins. When a thousand lotus leaves are pierced by a needle ignorant people think that the piercing of all leaves is at the same time, but really the leaves are pierced at separate units of time. This is the subtileness of Kāla. But though Kāla is very very subtile, it is also great and measurement of it can be computed because of the motions of planets.' The Vāyu and Kūrma both say 'Time creates beings and again destroys them; all are under the rule of Time, while Time is not under the dominance of any one.'

The ViṣṇuPuraṇa [^673] holds that Brahma which is one, unborn, permanent, ageless appears in the form of Kāla, which is without beginning or end. The Bhāgavatapurāṇa [^674] also regards Kāla as inferred in regard to its minuteness and its grossness is all-pervading, and holds that it is supposed to have units from the subtlest (atom) to the highest...

Among astronomical works the Sūryasiddhānta states [^675] 'Kāla is the destroyer of worlds; another (kind of time) is of the nature of calculation; Kāla is of two kinds, gross and subtile, which are also called _mūrta_ (physically apprehensible ) and _amūrta_ ( not so apprehended); (the divisions of ) time called prāṇa ( respiration) and the like are mūrta, while _truṭi_ and the like are _amūrta_.' The Caraka-saṁhitā[^676] includes Kāla among nine dravyas and holds that it is _acetana_ (non-sentient). Thus it agrees with the Vaiśeṣika view. In the Suśrutasaṁhitā it is declared 'Kāla is indeed self-existent, without beginning, middle or end; the poverty or richness of substances that have ( one or more of the six ) flavours (rasas) and the life and death of human beings are dependent on Kāla. It is called Kāla because it does not remain sticking to even the smallest division or because it heaps together (beings by leading beings to death ) or drives them together. Of that adorable Kāla which assumes the character of year, the divine Sun produces by his special movements the divisions called twinkling of the eye, kāṣṭhā &c.

## Kāla in grammatical works

Similarly, philosophical grammarians like Bhartṛhari [^677] ( author of the Vākyapadiya) holds that Kāla is a substance (dravya), all-pervading and permanent apart from activities, that it is the efficient cause of all created things, that it is divided into years, seasons &c. on account of the different activities, just as the same man may be called a carpenter or a blacksmith &c. (on account of his different activities ). For reasons of space it is not advisable to pursue the subject of the nature of time from other Sanskrit works of medieval and modern times. For those who desire to make a further study of this subject I would recommend the 'Kālasiddhānta-darśini' composed and published by Shri Haranchandra Bhattācārya of Calcutta in 1941, which exhaustively deals with the philosophical conceptions about Kāla held by different sects, schools and Sanskrit writers.

There is a great temptation to compare Indian ancient and medieval conceptions about Time arrived at more than a thousand years ago with similar or corresponding conceptions on the same subject in modern Western philosophical works such as Kant's 'Critique of pure reason', Prof. S. Alexander's 'Space, Time and Deity '(1927, London, two volumes ), 'Time and Western Man' by Wyndham Lewis (London, 1927), Pierre Burgelin's 'L' Homme et Le Temps' (1945), Bergson's Time and Freewill', S. G. F. Brandon's 'Time and Mankind' (1953). But as this volume has already grown to large proportions, comparisons with Western philosophical views have to be given up.

From very ancient times minute divisions of time have been mentioned. The Vāj. S. states [^678] 'that all winkings of the eye (and similar units of time) were produced from the (supreme). Person that is brilliant (like lightning). This half verse occurs in the Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad also. It is stated in the Bṛ. Up.[^679] that under the dominion of this imperishable _brahma_ the Sun and the Moon are held apart, as also _nimeṣas_, _muhūrtas_, days, and nights, half months, months, seasons, and years stand apart.

[^678]: सर्वे निमेषा जज्ञिरे विद्युतः पुरुषादधि । वाज. सं. 32. 2, महानारायण-उप. I. 8.

[^679]: एतस्य वा अक्षरस्य प्रशासने गार्गि सूर्याचन्दमसौ विधृतौ तिष्ठतः । ...एतस्य वा अक्षरस्य प्रशासने गार्गिनिमेषा मुहूर्ता अहोरात्रार्धमासा मासा ऋतवः संवत्सरा इति विधृतास्तिष्ठन्ति । बृह.उप. III. 8. 9.

The Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad' (I. 8-9) mentions as units of time ‘Nimeṣas, Kalā, muhūrta, kāṣṭhā, ahorātra, half months, months, ṛtus, year. Manu I. 64 provides that 18 Nimeṣas are equal to kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhās to kalā, 30 kalās to muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas are equal to one day and night. Early and very exhaustive enumeration of the several units of time from subtlest to the highest are contained in Bṛhat-saṁhitā of Varāha and in the bhāṣya of Praśastapāda on Vaiśesikasūtra [^680] viz. 'Kāla is the cause of the popular usage about the units being _kṣaṇa, lava, nimeṣas, kāṣṭhā, kalā_, muhūrta, yāma ( prahara or 1/8th of a day), ahorātra (day and night), ardhamāsa (half month), māsa ( month), ṛtu ( season), ayana, saṁvatsara (year), yuga, manvantara, kalpa, pralaya and mahāpralaya. The Puraṇas also dilate upon the units of time from nimeṣa to pralaya or kalpa. Vide Brahma 231, 6-12, Kūrma I. 5. 6-14, Padma V.3.4-20, Vāyu 57.6-35. Nimeṣa (lit. winking of the eye) is defined by the Vāyu and Viṣṇudharmottara as the time required for pronouncing a short letter and the latter adds that a smaller unit than it cannot be (physically ) apprehended. There is great divergence of views about the number and names of the minute units of time and their mutual relations. A few examples alone can be cited. Manu (I.64) furnishes the following table : 18 Nimeṣas=kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhās = Kāla, 30 Kālas = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas=ahorātra ( day and night). The Arthaśāstra. [^681] of Kautilya provides : 2 truṭas (i?)= lava, 2 lavas = Nimeṣa, five Nimeṣas == kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhās = kalā, 40 kalās = nāḍikā, 2 nāḍikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahorātra. Some of the Puraṇas contain the same [^682] verge on the names and relations of small units of time viz.15 Nimeṣas = kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhās = kalā, 40 kalās = nāḍikā, 2 nāḍikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = day and night together.

## Units of Kāla

It should be noticed that here the relation of Nimeṣas to kāṣṭhā is different from that in Manu and Kautilya. The Arthaśāstra [^683] of Kauṭilya does not stand alone in speaking of _truṭa_ ( ? i) as the smallest unit of time. The Sūryasinddhānta ( quoted above) provides that truṭi is the smallest unit of time, that it is _amūrta_ (not apprehended physically ), that the prāṇa is the first _mūrta_ (physically apprehended) unit of time, that 6 prāṇas are equal to a vināḍi, that 60 vināḍis are equal to a nāḍikā, 60 nāḍis are equal to an ahorātra. Utpala[^681] on Br. S. quotes verses from Pauliśa-siddhānta and Brāhmasphuṭa-siddhānta to the effect that six prāṇas are equal to a vināḍikā, 60 vināḍikās are equal to a nāḍikā or ghaṭikā and 60 ghaṭikās are equal to a day (i.e. ahorātra ). A smr̥ti quoted in the Tithitattva states that two truṭis make a lava, 2 lavas make a Nimeṣa, so that truṭi is equal to 1/4th of nimeṣa. Hemādri on Kāla (p.7) quotes a verse that truṭi is equal to two Nimeṣas and 10 truṭis are equal to prāṇa. The Amarakośa follows Manu as to eighteen Nimeṣas being equal to kāṣṭhā, but it introduces a unit called _kṣaṇa_ between kalā and muhūrta, so that its scheme is : 18 Nimeṣas - kāṣṭhā, 30 kāṣṭhās = kalā, 30 kalās = kṣaṇa, 12 kṣaṇas = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahorātra. The Bhāgavata-purāṇa (III. 11. 3-10) puts forward a far more elaborate scheme : two atoms (of Time ) = aṇu, 3 aṇus = trasareṇu, 3 trasareṇus = truṭi, 100 truṭis = vedha, 3 vedhas = lava, 3 lavas = nimeṣa, 3 Nimeṣas = kṣaṇa, 5 kṣaṇas = kāṣṭhā, 15 kāṣṭhās = laghu, 15 laghus = nāḍikā, 2 nāḍikās = muhūrta, 30 muhūrtas = ahorātra. In the Ātharvaṇa-jyotiṣa the table is: 12 nimeṣas=lava, 30 lavas=kalā, 30 kalās = truṭi, 30 truṭis = muhūrta. This agrees with none. Further units of time from ahorātra to _pralaya_ will be dwelt upon a little later.

Before proceeding further clarification is required on certain points. At least several centuries before Christ Jyotiṣa had attained the position of being one of the six _aṅgas_ ( auxiliary studies ) of the Veda.

[^683]: द्वौ निमेषौ त्रुटिर्ज्ञेया प्राणो दशत्रुटिः स्मृतः॥ विनाडिका तु षट् प्राणास्ताः षष्टिर्नाडिका मता॥ विष्णुधर्मोत्तर I. 73. 2-3 q. by हे. (on काल) p. 7.

[^684]: तथा च पौलिशे। षट्प्राणास्तु विनाडी तत्षष्टया नाडिका दिनं षष्टया । एतासां तत्त्रिंशन्मासस्तैर्द्वादशभिरब्दः ॥ उत्पल on बृह. सं. II. p. 24. भागवत (III. 11. 5) remarks that त्रसरेणु is visible (while परमाणु and अणु are not) and is the speck that is seen floating in the air when a pencil of the sun's rays comes through a window (जालार्करश्म्यवगत; खमेवानुपतन्नगात्)

The Muṇḍakopaniṣad [^685] states that the _aparā vidyā_ ( inferior exoteric knowledge ) comprises Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda, Atharvaveda, Śikṣā ( Phoneties), Kalpa (ritual texts ), Vyakaraṇa (grammar), Nirukta (Etymology ), Chandas ( metrics ) and Jyotiṣa ( astronomy and mathematics ). The Āpastamba-dharmasūtra enumerates the same six aṅgas of the Veda. In the Pāṇiniya Śikṣā [^686] the science of the movements of heavenly bodies is said to be the eye of the Veda. The Jyotiṣa which is Vedāṅga (of the Ṛgveda and Yajurveda ) was concerned with purely astronomical matters. In the Vedāṅga Jyotiṣa [^687] it is remarked : 'the Vedas arose for the purpose of (use in ) sacrifices; sacrifices are enjoined according to the order of times; therefore he who knows Jyotiṣa which is the science laying down the (proper ) times knows sacrifices. Just as a tuft of hair stands on the head of peacocks or a jewel (in the heads ) of cobras, so _gaṇita_ ( astronomical calculations) stand at the head of all the sciences that are (spoken of as) Vedāṅgas'. This shows that the words Jyotiṣa and _gaṇita_ are used as synonyms in the Vedāṅga-Jyotiṣa. The Vṛddha-vāsiṣṭhasiddhānta ( Benares S. Series ) says 'this śāstra is indeed the eye of the Veda; therefore, among the _aṅgas_ (limbs, subsidiary lores of Veda) it has got pre-eminence; a man endowed with all other limbs and therefore appearing to be perfect is worth nothing, if he is devoid of eyes.' Gradually, however, Jyotiṣa came to include three distinct branches (skandhas) viz. the determination of the motions of planets by means of calculations which was called Tantra, the second called _horā_ that deals with horoscopes and (was also called _jātaka_) and the third called Śākhā which was an extensive branch and included many topics of divination which are summarised in Br. S. chap. II.

## Branches of Jyotiṣa

A work embodying complete presentation of the three branches was called _saṁhitā_ [^688] and he who well knew the three branches, viz. gaṇita, Hora and Śakhā was called, as Garga says, 'saṁhitāpāraga' (master of saṁhitā ). Varāhamihira[^689] himself tells us in the Br̥haj-jataka, that, for the benefit of astrologers, he compiled a comprehensive work on Jyotiṣa in its three branches. The word saṁhitā appears to have been used in two senses, the first[^690] (a wider sense) referring to a complete presentation of Gaṇita, Horā and Śākhā, while the second (a narrower sense) refers only to the Śakhā. part. Why the third branch was called śākhā is not satisfactorily explained anywhere. It was so called probably because it had to deal with numerous circumstances, such as the fruits of the simple and retrograde movements of planets; the movements of Agastya ( Canopus) and _saptarṣis_ (Ursa Major), the conjunctions and oppositions of planets, haloes, meteors, earthquakes, lore about the movements and cries of birds, _nirājana_, removal of the evil effects of _utpātas_. In this sense saṁhitā was what is called _natural_ astrology. Horā again had three sub-sections, viz. _jātaka or janma_ ( judicial astrology, predictions from the situations of the zodiacal signs and planets at a person's birth ), Yātrā or Yātrika ( Br̥haj-jātaka 28.4-5) that dealt with prognostications on starting on a journey or on a king's marching against an enemy derived from the tithi, nakṣatra, the week-day, the muhūrta, the moon's position, dreams, throbbing of limbs, the cries of birds, and _vivāha_ i.e. examining the horoscopes of the parties to a marriage ( called Vivāhakāla or Vivāhapaṭala ).

The usual practice of the Gr̥hyasūtras and Dharmaśāstra works was to take their astronomical requirements and knowledge from astronomers. The Gobhila-Gr̥hyasūtra[^691] provides: 'the work on this point is separate; one should study it or should obtain information about ( the exact time of) the _parvan_ (New moon and Full moon) from those who know it.' The astronomical knowledge of ancient and medieval India has been a subject riddled with acute controversies. Somewhat reluctantly I have come to the conclusion that discussions about the theories and practice of astronomy in ancient and medieval India should be omitted from the History of Dharmaśāstra. An adequate treatment of ancient and medieval Indian astronomy and discussion of the theories advanced by Western scholars (some of them quite unwarranted) would require a large volume by itself. Here and there I may have to refer to pure astronomical matters for certain purposes. But the two other branches of Jyotiṣa, viz. Horā (astrology ) and Śākhā have exerted a vast influence on Dharmaśāstra and will have to be discussed within limits. Though Dharmaśāstra writers took their astronomy from astronomers, they did not hold that astronomers had the last word, but they rather hold that if there was some conflict or contradiction between strict astronomical theory and Dharmaśāstra, the latter was to prevail. An example may be cited for illustrating this: Suppose that a man has resolved to undertake 'ekabhakta-vrata' on 7th tithi. The saṅkalpa for a vrata is as a general rule to be made in the morning. Suppose that 7th is mixed with 6th and 8th tithis and that 7th commences about 10 A. M. on a certain week-day; then according to Yugmavākya (vide p. 75 note 191 above) 7th mixed with 6th is to be preferred for the vrata and the saṅkalpa would have to be repeated in the morning when according to correct astronomical calculation the tithi might be only the 6th at that time.

## Western Scholars on Indian Astronomy

Devala declares that a tithi is, for the purposes of religious bath, gifts and vratas, to be regarded as covering the whole day if the Sun sets during the period [^692] of that tithi. Vide Kr̥tyaratnākara p. 299 and Smṛtikaustubha ( on tithi p. 12 ) for other examples.

About Astronomy and Astrology as developed in India Western scholars such as Weber, Whitney, Thibaut have propounded many sweeping and unwarranted theories based on flimsy data. Here and there I may have to refer to them. But I must say in one place how and why their conclusions are often unacceptable. In the first place, they do not attach due importance to the fact that a vast literature in Sanskrit has perished beyond recovery (as it is admitted was the case in Greece after Ptolemy composed his Almagest )[^693] and what we now have is a mere fraction of what once existed. In the second place, they forget or ignore that much of the literature that survives is religious and not intended to be a historical and full treatment of any topic i.e. most of the references to astronomical matters found in the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas are not made of set purpose but are incidental or casual. They hardly seem to be aware of the rule of caution and common sense that in ancient literature what is expressly stated may be used for drawing inferences, but the non-mention of certain matters cannot necessarily be a valid reason for arriving at the conclusion of non-existence, unless the subject matter was such that if something connected with it existed it should ordinarily have been mentioned. Further, and most important of all, mere similarities in institutions, usages and other matters should not be regarded as evidence of borrowing by one people from another people. Human mind is the same everywhere, its environment and the needs of human beings are often the same and no people, ancient or modern, can be regarded as having had the monopoly of great intellectual powers. Most of those who wrote on Indian literature and subjects in the 19th century were nurtured on the literature of the Greeks and Romans and on the vaunted superiority of the ancient Greeks in Philosophy, Mathematics, arts and other matters and of Egypt. But as ancient cuneiform tablets in Babylonia and the Middle East countries came to be deciphered, things began to be seen in proper perspective.

Modern scholars have, it is refreshing to note, outgrown the stage when all arts were traced to Greek (see 'Sumerians' by Sir Leonard Woolley, 1928 p. 193, Glanville in 'Legacy of Egypt' p. 160 for the debt the Greeks owed to Egypt). Sir Thomas Heath was obliged to admit that the debt of the Greeks to the Babylonians was much greater than had been imagined.[^694] Sarton in a 'History of Science' (London, 1953) has to say that it is childish to assume that science began in Greek (Preface p. IX). It has been found that the Greeks were inferior to the Babylonians in several respects, that their vaunted geometric lore was not as great intellectually as supposed, that out of 200 propositions in Euclid's twelve books only about a dozen are necessary as a preparation for modern mathematics and that the Greeks much developed geometry because they could not easily employ ordinary arithmetical methods owing to their dependence on the abacus. [^695] It was further found that the sexagesimal system of degrees, minutes and seconds used by Ptolemy was of Babylonian origin and according to Herodotus (II. 109) the Greeks derived two kinds of Sun-dials and the division of the day into 12 parts from the Babylonians.[^696] At present such nations as England, France, Germany, U. S. S. R. and U. S. A. are the foremost nations in Science, Technology and Industry but they clung for about 1400 years to the Almagest of Ptolemy as their astronomical Bible, were ignorant of the decimal place value system and the use of a sign for zero till the so-called 'Arabic numerals' (borrowed from India ) were introduced into Europe[^697].

[^694]: Vide 'Greek Astronomy' (1932) by Sir Thomas L. Heath Intro. p. LIV, In 'Children of the Sun' by W. J. Perry ( first published in 1923 ) on p. 428 (chap. 26) the author, after discussing the possible origin of the archaic civilization of North America, China and India, had the hardihood to say that no good reason could be found for believing that it developed in any of those areas ... and that it is in Egypt that the archaic civilization came into being, though he generously concedes that every element was not necessarily invented by the Egyptians, but he bolds tbat it took shape in Egypt and was propagated thence.

Vide Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. IX p. 119 for the statement that '_Sindhind_' (i.e. Siddhanta) was translated into Arabic in the reign of Mansur (754-775 A. D.).

## Galileo and European priestshood

The intolerance of ignorant and bigoted priests in Europe went so far as to condemn Galileo, one of the greatest intellects in mechanics and astronomy, to perpetual imprisonment at the age of 70 for no greater offence than holding fast to the Copernican theory. Hardly any parallel to such an attempt to suppress honest difference of opinion as regards heavenly bodies can be found in any non-European country claiming to have a civilization.

There are controversies about the relation of astronomy and astrology. The marvellous spectacle of the sky at night containing thousands of stars of different brightness all apparently in motion round the earth, the Sun's annual northward and southward passage in the sky, Full Moon and its disappearance for one day and its phases, eclipses of the Sun and the Moon, comets and falling stars--all these must have struck even the most primitive men with wonder and also with fear and forebodings. In course of time arose astronomy and astrology. In ancient times both words had the same meaning. The Cambridge Ancient History (1925, vol. III. pp. 238-239) holds that the whole science of astronomy is due to astrology. On the other hand Prof. Neugebauer and Mr. Peter Doig see no evidence for this theory.[^698] In my humble opinion if we restrict ourselves to existing literatures of different peoples and eschew more conjectures and speculation, both astronomy and astrology are equally ancient and must have acted and reacted on one another in very ancient times. In the following pages some evidence will be given from Vedic literature of the simultaneous cultivation in India of both astronomy and astrology (particularly natural). To a modern scientist, the lucubrations of astrologers in their available works appear to be sheer nonsense. But the fundamental principle assumed by astrology that heavenly bodies exert predictable influence on terrestrial things and persons is not different from the principles of astronomy or meteorology whereby one can predict tides, eclipses, storms, torrential rains, and the like which affect the world and human beings.

[^698]. Vide 'Exact Sciences in Antiquity' (1951) p. 161 by Prof. Neugebauer and 'Concise history of Astronomy' by Mr. Peter Doig (London, 1950) p. 2.

Whether the stars and planets exert some influence on earthly things is not the real question. Probably they do, but the really important question is whether astrological works and astrologers have discovered correct methods and reached correct knowledge about the influence of planets on the human mind and on the day-today activities of human beings.

The astronomical and astrological literature in Sanskrit falls into three slightly overlapping periods. The first period is that of the Vedic Saṁhitās and the Brāhmaṇas from the mists of antiquity to about 800 B.C. The second is represented by the VedāṅgaJyotiṣa, the Śrauta, Gr̥hya and Dharma sūtras, Manu and Yājñavalkya, Garga and Jain works like the Sūryaprajñapti and ended about the 3rd century A, D. The third period begins at the commencement of the Christian era and is represented by the works called Siddhānta and gave rise to the works of Aryabhata (born 476 A. D.), of Varāhamihira (about 475 to 550 A. D.), Brahmagupta (born in 598 A. D.) and so on. Those who want to make a deep study of the History of Hindu Astronomy should carefully read the work in Marathi written by Shankar Balkrishna Dixit in 1896 (2nd edition in 1931 by his son). Even Thibaut who is generally chary of praising any Indian achievement in astronomy was constrained to observe that Dikshit's work is the richest source of Indian astronomical material and that his treatment from Brahmagupta onwards is particularly detailed (Grundriss, p. 3). Dikshit held that the scientific system of Indian astronomy is essentially independent and rests on Indian observations. In my humble opinion this view is far sounder than the view that the scientific astronomy of India was derived from or was greatly influenced by Greek astronomy. I have decided (as stated above p. 480) not to enter into detailed discussions about astronomical matters.
