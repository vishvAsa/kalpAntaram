<h2 id="list-of-vratas-and-utsavas">LIST OF VRATAS AND UTSAVAS</h2>
<p>The following list of vratas and <em>utsavas</em> does not claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But it is far more exhaustive and informative than any similar list so far prepared in English by any one or contained in any work in English. The line of demarcation between vratas and utsavas is very thin. Many vratas contain an element of festivities and many utsavas have more or less a religious element also and were religious in the beginning though later on they became secular, like the Olympic games of Greece. It may be pointed out that in the Asiatic Researches, vol. III, Sir William Jones published a list of Hindu festival days based on the Tithitattva (pp. 257-293 ) and Prof. Kielhorn also inserted a list of festival days based mainly on the Dharmasindhu in I. A. vol. 26 pp. 177-187. Both these are meagre. The Indian Ephemeris ( vol. I part 1 pp. 55-69 ) has a long descriptive list and a brief but accurate account of Indian festivals in relation to tithis and vice versa. Yet it is not as exhaustive as this list will be and it refers hardly to any authoritative texts. Very recently in the Report (1953) of the Calendar Reform Committee presided over by the late Dr. M. N. Saha there is a list of lunar festivals ( from Caitra onward) and solar festivals and of some important tithis (pp. 101–108) and an alphabeticed list of festivals ( pp. 111-115), which is exhaustive but its great defect is that no texts are cited or referred to and hardly any details are given except month, pakṣa and tithi. There are a few works on vratas written in Bengali and other regional languages of India, but I could not include most of them in this volume as I do not know most of those languages, though I have referred to some of them. Apart from vratas and utsavas certain matters and technical terms that occur frequently in works on vratas have been included. The list is arranged in the Sanskrit alphabetical order, though everything is transliterated into the English alphabet for the convenience of printing. For saving space abbreviations have been very largely employed and a list of the most important abbreviations is given in the preceding pages. As regards each vrata the time when it begins, whether it is a tithivrata or pāravrata, saṁvatsara-vrata or &amp; nakṣatravrata or a prakirṇaka vrata is generally indicated ( except where from its very title or description its nature is clear), the deity to be worshipped is pointed out where possible or necessary, some details are added in certain cases, and some of the works in which it is described are mentioned. The rewards promised are not generally set out, as most of them are included in the rewards mentioned on p. 55–56 above, and as they are often too numerous to specify and also for reasons of space. Similarly, tithis that are Yugādi or Yugāntya or Manvādi or Kalpādi have not all been noted as they are too many but they are enumerated in one place under the words Yugādi &amp;c. I have made great efforts to trace the Paurāṇic quotations to their sources, but I regret that I have not been quite successful owing to several causes such as the vast extent of Purāṇas, owing to several recensions of the same purāṇa and owing to my inadvertence or sheer weariness. One feels that tracing a verse to its origin is often as difficult as finding a pin in a haystack. The author or authors of Purāṇas often wrote like modern advertisers of medicines, toilet articles &amp;c. Most of the vratas are said to have been declared by divinities like Śiva to Pārvati, by Kr̥ṣṇa to Yudhiṣṭhira, by great sages like Mārkaṇḍeya, Nārada, Dhaumya, Yājñavalkya, Vasiṣṭha and it is often added that the Vrata is a great secret not narrated or known even to gods and goddesses e.g. Śivarātrivrata (in HV II. 88).</p>
<p>It may not be out of place to point out here what should be done about the numerous vratas and utsavas, described so far and to be mentioned in the long list that follows. Many of the vratas and utsavas once observed have already gone out of vogue owing to various causes. But it would not do to recommend the abolition of all vratas and utsavas even in the latter half of the 20th century. Some seasonal vratas and festivals should be kept up as in the case of Divāli and Holikā, but they should be shorn of extravagances like gambling on Balipratipadā or the obscenities and dirt-throwing indulged in by some people in Holika. Other vratas and utsavas like the Rāmanavami, Vijaya daśamī, Kr̥ṣṇa-janmāṣṭami should also be celebrated in order to remind the present generation of the great heroes and <em>avatāras</em> of the past and the supreme values they exemplified in their lives and a few new ones such as the Jayantis of Shivaji, Guru Govindsingh, Tagore, Tilak and Gandhi may be added. Besides, such vratas as Vaṭa-sāvitri and Haritālikā may still be emphasized for observance by women and lastly such nice observances redolent of disinterested regard and affection as Rakṣābandhana and Bhrātr̥dvitīyā deserve to be preserved.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that several vratas depend conjointly upon month, tithi and nakṣatra together. It is difficult to classify such vratas and my classification may in some cases appear to be arbitrary. For saving space the details mentioned above will not generally be conveyed in regular sentences, but in catch-words only. The figures after the abbreviated name of a work represent pages and Roman figures refer to volumes or parts; and double Arabic figures with a dot between represent chapter and verses respectively. As most vratas are tithivratas, the word tithi is not mentioned where the vrata has reference to a tithi alone and to no other particular (such as month or week-day &amp;c.). The word vrata has been generally omitted after the names, except where I felt that doubt or confusion is likely to be caused. The word &lsquo;purāṇa&rsquo; is not added to the names of purāṇas such as Agni, Vāmana &amp;c. Except in the case of purāṇas references to medieval digests and commentaries are generally arranged in chronological order. The following abbreviations are used for months and half months: Cai. = Caitra, Vai. = Vaiśākha, Jy. = Jyeṣṭha, Ās. = Āṣāḍha, Śr. = Śrāvana, Bh. =Bhādrapada, Āśv.=Āśvina, K.=Kārtika, Mārg. = Mārgaśirsa, P. = Pauṣa, M, = Māgha, Phā. = Phālguna; Śu.or śu.= Śukla, Kr̥. or kr̥.= Kr̥ṣṇa (pakṣa).</p>

VKK 142 says &lsquo;arghya for all deities consists of sandalwood paste, flowers, whole grains of <em>yava</em>, tips of kuśa grass, sesame, mustard and dūrvā.&rsquo; Vide HV I. 48, KR 296, VR 16 (for eight ingredients of).</p>
<p><em>Ardhaśrāvaṇika-vrata</em>-begin on 1st of Śr. śu.; one month; worship of Pārvati called Ardhaśrāvaṇī; worshipper to observe <em>ekabhakta</em> or <em>nakta</em> for one month; at end to offer dinner to maidens and brāhmaṇas; HV II. 753–754 (from Br.), VP (folios 106-107).</p>
<p><em>Ardhodaya-vrata</em>-This is a vrata of rare occurrence and is said to be equal in holiness to a crore of Sun eclipses. Later medieval digests (e. g. TT 187, KSS 30, NS 211, SmK. 442-445, P. C. 316 ) quote a verse from Mahābhārata &lsquo;when in the month of Pauṣa or Māgha there is amāvāsyā with Śravaṇa-nakṣatra and Vyatipāta-yoga, that is called Ardhodaya and Vratārka (folios 348a-350b) states that according to Prayāga-setu of Bhatta Nārāyaṇa it takes place in Pauṣa when amānta reckoning is used and in Māgha when Pūrṇimānta reckoning is used. HV (II. pp. 246–252) quotes from Skanda and adds Sunday to the above requirements and BB (pp. 364-365) adds that the Sun must be in Makara (Capricorn). The TT 187, Vratārka folio 348a and PC 316 read a half verse &rsquo;this yoga is commended only if it occurs by day and not so if at night.&rsquo; KSS 30 provides that if one out of the several requirements (Pauṣa or Māgha Amāvāsyā, Vyatīpāta, Śravaṇa-nakṣatra, Sunday ) is absent, it becomes Mahodaya-parva. In Ardhodaya a bath at Prayāga in the morning is most meritorious, but it is provided that all rivers become like the Ganges at Ardhodaya. The devatās of the vrata are three viz. Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara and they are worshipped in the same order; offerings (of ghee) are made in fire with Paurāṇika mantras, and also with three Vedic mantras viz. &lsquo;Prajāpate&rsquo; (R̥g. X. 121. 10) for Brahmā, &lsquo;Idam Viṣṇur&rsquo; (R̥g. I 22, 17 ) for Viṣṇu, &ldquo;Tryambakam yajāmahe&rsquo; (R̥g. VII. 59. 12) for Maheśvara. At the end gifts of cow or money are made. In I. A. vol. 25 p. 345 there is mention of Ardhodaya in śake 1352, Pauṣa, which corresponds to 14th January (Sunday) 1431 A. D. The reference to the distribution of all his wealth by Emperor Harṣavardhana at Prayāga once in five years made by the Chinese traveller Yuan Chwang (vide 7 I. A. 196 at p. 198) is not to Ardhodaya at all, as some suppose. If Beal&rsquo;s B. R. W. W. vol. I. pp. 214 and 233 be carefully read this will be clear.</p>
<p><em>Alakṣmināśaka-snāna</em>-On full moon of P. when there is Puṣya nakṣatra, persons should bathe after anointing their bodies with white mustard and drive off <em>alakṣmi</em> (misfortune or poverty) and worship images of Nārāyaṇa, Indra, Moon, Bṛhaspati and Puṣya by bathing them with water in which sarvauṣadhis are put and with homa. Vide SMK 344-345, PC 307, GK 178.</p>
<p><em>Alavaṇatr̥tiyā</em>-On śu. 3 of any month, specially of Vai., Bh. or M.; women alone to perform; fast on 2nd and food on 3rd without salt; Gauri worshipped; it may be for life; KKV 48–51, HV I. 474-477, S. Pr. folio 32a. Vide Bhav., Brāhmaparva 21. 1-22 for this.</p>
<p><em>Avatāras</em>-Tithis of the appearance of (they are called Jayantis), cited in NS 81-82 and KSS 13 as follows: Matsya-Cai. śu. 3; Kūrma-Vai. pūrṇimā; Varāha-Bh. śu. 3; Narasiṁha-Vai. śu. 14; Vāmana-Bh. śu. 12, Paraśurāma-Vai. śu. 3; Rāma Cai. su. 9; Balarāma-Bh. śu. 2; Kr̥ṣṇa-Śr. kr. 8; Buddha-Jy. śu. 2. Some works say Kalkin is yet to appear while others give Śr. śu 6 as Kalkijayanti. Some works differ as to the tithis e. g. some say Matsya appeared on Cai. śu. 5 (and not 3). Vide Sri B. Bhattacharya&rsquo;s paper on the ten avatāras and their birth dates&rsquo; in volume of studies presented to Dr. F. W. Thomas pp. 31-33 quoted from Śakti-saṅgamatantra I. See under Vaiśākha. The Eran Inscription of Toramāna refers to Varāhāvatāra (Gupta Inscriptions p. 159). Var. 48. 20–22 (q. by both KKV 333 and HV. I 1039 ) state which avatāra out of the well-known ten (including Buddha and Kalkin as separate) is worshipped for what object.</p>
<p><em>Avamadina</em>—a week day on which two tithis end is so called. NS 153 quoting Ratnamālā (&ldquo;Yatraikaḥ spr̥śate tithidvayā. vasānam vāras-ced-avamadinam taduktam-āryaiḥ&rdquo;). This is to be avoided when beginning a vrata for the first time, as there is kṣaya of a tithi here.</p>
<p><em>Avighnavināyaka or Avighnavrata</em>-(1) begin on Phā. 4th; tithi; four months; Gaṇeśa worshipped. HV I 524-525, KKV 82-83, both quoting from Varāha 59. 1-10; (2) 4th tithi on both fortnights; three years; Gaṇeśa deity; NA 43 ( from Bhav U).</p>
<p><em>Aviyogadvādaśi</em>-Bh. śu. 12; tithi; worship of Śiva and Gauri, Brahmā and Sāvitri, Viṣṇu and Lakṣmi, the sun and his consort Nikṣubhā. HV I. 1177-1180.</p>
<p><em>Aviyogavrata or Aviyogatr̥tīyā</em>&ndash;For women; begin on Mārg. śu. 2 with partaking rice boiled in milk and sugar on 3rd; worship of Gāuri and Śambhu; for a year; worship of images of both made from rice flour under different names in each of twelve months with different flowers; KKV 70-75, HV I 439-444, KR 452-455. Vide Bhav U. 22 for this.</p>
<p><em>Avaidhavyaśuklaikādaśī</em>-Cai. śu. 11; HVI. 1151 (only one verse from Vi. Dh.).</p>
<p><em>Avyaṅgasaptami</em>-Śr. śu. 7; tithi; to be performed every year: &lsquo;AVYAṄGA&rsquo; to be offered to the sun; &lsquo;Avyaṅga&rsquo; is explained in KKV 150 as a hollow strip made of fine white cotton thread, resembling a serpent&rsquo;s slough, 122 fingerbreadths long (the best ), or 120 (middling ) or 108 (the shortest). It seems to have been like the <em>Kusti</em> worn by modern Parsis. Vide Bhav. (Brahma-parva ) 111. 1-8 q. by KKV 149–151 and HV I. 741-743, also V. P (folio 116, which mentions the story of Sāmba in Bhav.). The printed Bhav. uses the word &lsquo;abhyaṅga&rsquo;: In Bhav. (Brāhma ) 142. 1-29 we have the legend of Avyaṅgotpatti. In verse 18 occurs the word &lsquo;sārasanaḥ&rsquo; which reminds one of &lsquo;Saracen&rsquo;. Vide Nār. I. 116. 29–31 for AVYAṄGĀKHYA VRATA, the 7th tithi being destroyer of sins if it is conjoined to Hasta-nakṣatra. Avyaṅga appars to be a Sanskrit adaptation of the Avestan &lsquo;Aivyaṅghana&rsquo; (meaning &lsquo;girdle&rsquo;). In the 16 ślokas addressed to the prince Jadi Rāṇā by the Parsis emigrating to India occurs this &lsquo;who put on the waist a woollen <em>kushti</em> which is fastened on the <em>sadra</em> (garment), each end of which is like the mouth of a serpent, which is tied into knots at equal distances&rsquo; ( vide M. M. Murzban&rsquo;s &lsquo;Parsis in India &lsquo;vol. I at p. 93). It seems probable that this particular form of Sun-worship was imported from Iran or was borrowed from Parsi practices. The Br. S. (59.19 ) states that the priests of Savitr̥̥ should be Magas i.e. Maga or Śākadvipiya brāhmaṇas for whom vide I. A. vol. VIII. 328 and Weber&rsquo;s edition of Magavyakti of Krishnadas Mishra.</p>
<p><em>Aśūnyaśayanavrata or Aśūnyaśayanadvitiyā</em>-on dark 2nd tithi of four months from Śr.; tithi; Lakṣmi and Hari worshipped; occurs in Vi. Dh I. 145. 6-20 and III. 132. 1-12, Vā. 16. 16–29, Āgni 177. 3-12, Bhav. I. 20. 4-28, KKV 41-44 (q. from Bhav U) and 44-46 (from Mat. 71. 2–20=Pād, V. 24, 1-19). The Matsya contains a somewhat different mode; HVI. 366-371 (from Bhav.) and 371-377 (from Bhav U); KR 225-228 ( quotes Bhav I. 20.4-28). This vrata secured <em>avaidhavya</em> to women and <em>aviyoga</em> ( absence of the loss of wife ) to men. Vide S. Pr. (folio 22b ) and SmK 146-148. One of the mantras that occur in both KKV 43 and HV I. 373 is &lsquo;Lakṣmyā na śūnyaṁ varada yathā te śayanaṁ sadā । śayyā mamāpyaśūnyāstu tathātra Madhusūdana&rsquo;॥. KR (p. 228 ) remarks that when it is said that the vrata begins in Śr. Kr̥., the month is <em>pūrṇimānta</em> according to the usage. Mentioned in &lsquo;Corpus of Inscriptions in the Teliṅgana Districts of Nizam&rsquo;s Dominions&rsquo; by Dr. Srinivasachar No. 50 pp. 140-142 of śake 1198 Māgha śu. 10 (1276 A. D.) where Kuppāmbikā wife of a Kākatīya General is said to have performed it.</p>
<p><em>Aśūnyavrata</em>-on dark 2nd tithi of four months from Śr., in which <em>arghya</em> with curds, whole grains of rice and fruits are offered to the moon; if the second tithi is mixed with (viddhā) the third tithi on a certain day the vrata should be performed on that day;P C83.</p>
<p><em>Aśokakalikābhakṣaṇa</em>-Vide Aśokāṣṭami.</p>

<p><em>Aśokadvādaśī</em>-same as Viśokadvādaśī. Begin in Āśv.; for a year; on 10th take light meal, on 11th fast and on 12th pāraṇā; worship of Keśava; results are health, beauty and freedom from sorrow; Mat. 81. 1-28, 82. 26-30 quoted in KKV 360-363; HV I. 1075-1078 ( quotes almost same verses from Pad).</p>

KV 422 ( quotes mantra from Liṅga ), HK 626 (from Viṣṇu), HV I 862-63 (from Liṅga ) and 875–76 (from Ādityapurāṇa but no mantra ); KR 126-127; R. M (1379-80 ) has the mantra &rsquo;tvām-aśoka harābhiṣṭa&rsquo; and the verse &lsquo;Aśoka-kalikāś-cāṣtau &lsquo;and BB 1734-35, both of which verses are Gar. I 133. 1-2; PC 109; SMK 94. Vide JRAS for 1900 pp. 545. 791 and for 1901 p. 127 for some remarks. (2) KV 422, KR. 126, KT 463 and other digests state that all tirthas and rivers come to the Brahmaputrā on Cai. śu. 8 and a bath in it on that day yields the same rewards as Vājapeya, when it falls on Wednesday and on Punarvasu.</p>
<p><em>Aśokikāṣṭami</em>-Worship of Umā. NM p. 74 (verses 905-907) states that Aśoka plant is Devi herself.</p>
<p><em>Aśvatthavrata</em>-Vratārka ( folio 406b-408a ) from Adbhutasāgara following Ātharvaṇaśākhā; worship of Aśvattha in case of evil portents, invasions, epidemics, diseases like leprosy.</p>

<p><em>Aśvapūjā</em>-On Āśv. śu. 1 to 9; see below under Āśvina.</p>
<p><em>Aśvavrata</em>- a Saṁvatsaravrata; Indra is the deity; Mat. 101.71 q. by KKV 449, HV II. 911 (quotes same 1 1/2 verses from Pad).</p>
<p><em>Aṣṭamivratas</em>-There are about 30 Aṣṭami-vratas, which will be entered at the proper places. General rule is that in the bright half Aṣṭami mixed with Navami is to be preferred and in dark half aṣṭami mixed with saptami is preferred. Vide TT 40, DS 15. For Aṣṭamivratas vide HV I. 811-886, KN 194–228, KKV 225-272, VR 256-319, VKK 38-40, PC. 109-139. There are a few exceptions to above two rules, some of which may be noted at the proper places.</p>
<p><em>Asidhārāvrata</em>-begin on Ās, śu. 15; five days or ten days after As.15, K.15 or for 4 months from Āṣ., or one year or 12 years; one has to sleep on bare ground, to bathe outside house, eat food only in the night, to remain celibate even though sleeping in wife&rsquo;s embrace, curb anger and be devoted to <em>japa</em> and <em>homa</em> to Hari. Different rewards acc. to length of time, the greatest being that after twelve years of this vrata the observer may secure the rulership of the world and on death become one with Janārdana. Vi. Dh. III. 218. 1-25 q. by HV II. 825-827. The word means the vrata is as sharp or difficult as treading on the edge of a sword. The Raghuvaṁśa 13. 67 in referring to Bharata&rsquo;s abstention from enjoying regal splendour out of regard for the exiled Rāma calls it <em>ugra</em> &lsquo;iyanti varṣāṇi tayā sahogram-abhyasyatīva vratam āsidhāram&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Ahan</em>-a day. There are several views about the divisions of the day, viz. into two, three, four, five, eight, or fifteen parts. The two are pūrvāhṇa and aparāhṇa ( as in Manu III. 278 ); for three vide notes 257–258 above. Four parts described by Gobhila (q. by KN p. 110 ) are pūrvāhṇa ( for 1 1/2 <em>prahara</em>), madhyāhṇa for one prahara, aparāhṇa up to the end of the 3rd prahara and thereafter sāyāhṇa till end of day. For names of five divisions vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 376. In R̥g. V. 76. 3 (utāyātam saṅgave prātarahno) three of the five parts of a day viz. <em>prātaḥ</em>, <em>saṅgava</em> and <em>madhyandina</em> are expressly mentioned. Eight divisions of the day are mentioned by Kautilya (I. 19), Dakṣa ( chap. 2) and Katyāyana. Kālidāsa in Vikramorvāśiya II. 1 (sasṭhe bhāge) appears to know this. There are fifteen muhūrtas of the day and fifteen of the night. Vide Br̥hadyogayātrā VI. 2-4 for 15 muhūrtas. As the day and night become long or short at different places (except on the equator) each of the muhūrtas will vary in length to some extent even in the same place in different seasons of the year. Similarly, pūrvāhṇa or prātaḥkāla will be of 7 1/2 muhūrtas if day is divided only in two parts, if into five parts pūrvāhṇa or prātaḥ will comprise only three muhūrtas. The KN (p. 112) remarks that the division into five parts being observed in many Vedic and Smr̥ti texts as the principal division, that division, is the one resorted to in the śāstric passages about positive and negative injunctions. Vide HK 325-329, VKK 18–19, KTV 6, 367.</p>
<p><em>Ahiṁsāvrata</em>—not to eat flesh for a year and then donate a cow and a golden deer; saṁvatsara vrata ; KKV 444, HV II. 865 ( quoting Pad. = Mat. 101. 35).</p>
<p><em>Ahirbradhnasnāna</em>-HV II. pp. 654-655 (from Vi. Dh. ). On a day on which there is Pūrvābhādrapadā-nakṣatra performer to bathe in water from two jars in which are put udumbara leaves, pañcagavya, water with kuśas, sandalwood paste &amp;c; worship of Ahirbradhna, the Sun, Varuṇa, the moon, Rudra, and Viṣṇu. Ahirbudhnya was the presiding deity of Uttarābhādrapadā acc. to Br. S. 97.5, Bhav U. q. by HV II p. 596, KR 560. Vide H. of Dh. II. p. 247, note 563 for the devatās of all nakṣatras. This secured thousands of cows and highest prosperity. Ahirbudhnya is the correct and ancient form. In about ten passages of the R̥gveda &lsquo;Ahirbudhnyaḥ&rsquo; appears to be some deity (probably Agni), vide.R̥g I. 186. 5, II. 31. 6, V. 41, 16, VI. 49. 14, VI, 50. 14; VII. 34. 17, VII. 35. 13, VII. 38. 5, &amp;c. and Nir.

<p><em>Ādityavāravratāni</em>-HV II. 520-577, KKV 8 ff, Vratārka folios 3754b–3794b.</p>
<p><em>Ādityavrata</em>-(1) for men and specially for women; begin on Aśv.

<p><em>Utsarjana</em>-Vide H. of Dh. vol. II 815-818, NS 120-121, SmK 164-167.</p>
<p><em>Utsavas</em>-Numerous utsavas are mentioned in the Purāṇas and works on vrata. Some of these such as Holikā, Durgotsava have already been described at some length above. A few more will be briefly dealt with at appropriate places in the list. The word &rsquo; utsava&rsquo; occurs in R̥g. I. 100. 8 and I. 102. 1 and is derived from the root <em>śu</em> in the sense of &lsquo;urging or inspiring&rsquo; by Sāyaṇa. Vide &lsquo;India Antiqua&rsquo; (a volume presented to Dr. J. Ph. Vogel) pp 146-153 where Prof. Gonda derives it from root &lsquo;su&rsquo; (rather unconvincingly).</p>
<p><em>Udakasaptami</em>-drinking only a handful of water on 7th tithi gives happiness ; KKV 184, HV I. 726 ( from Bhav).</p>
<p><em>Udasevikā</em>-same as Bhūtamātr̥-utsava. This utsava followed immediately after the Indradhvaja was taken down ( i.e. it took place on Bh. śu. 13 ). It somewhat resembled the wild and mystic Roman Bacchanalia. In HV II 359-365, KKN 413-421 and KR 387-395 this festival is described at length from the Skanda. The origin is traced to Bhairava and a girl called Udasevikā ( whose body was smeared with mud) sprung from the mind of Śiva and Parvati respectively. They became husband and wife. All people become on this day vociferous about sexual matters. Men and women go out like crazy persons, ride asses, bulls and dogs, smear themselves with ashes and mud, even men 100 years old act like boys, become void of shame, utter obscene songs, dress like cowherds, <em>dombas</em>, barbers and also went about naked. It is remarkable that Skanda averred that gods and <em>pitṛ̥s</em> did not accept the offerings of a man who did not take part in this festival and remained aloof. There was difference of views about the time when the utsava was to be celebrated. Vide HV II p. 368, and VP ( folios 91-92), which place it in Jy. kr. 1 to 15 ( by pūrṇimānta reckoning).</p>
<p><em>Uddālakavrata</em>-Vide Vas. Dh. S. XI. 76-77; it was prescribed for one who was patitasāvitrīka. See H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 376-377. In HV II p. 932 ( from Brah.), it is described as subsisting on āmiksā and boiled milk for two months each, eight days on curds, three days on ghee and total fast for one day.</p>
<p><em>Udyāpana</em>-Vide pp. 120–21 above. It is said in KTV 95 that in some vratas like Kr̥ṣṇajanmāṣṭami to be observed throughout one&rsquo;s life there is no udyāpana.</p>

Bath at Prayāga and the large concourse of <em>sādhus</em> are the two predominant objects of those who gather there in thousands and sometimes millions.

For the meaning of <em>nakta</em> vide pp. 101-102 above. It consists in eating nothing by day and taking food only at night. Naktavrata may extend over a month, or four months or a year.

<p><em>Nakṣatratithi-vāra-graha-yoga-vratānı</em>-HV II. 588-590 (from Kālottara) deals summarily with certain (about 16) special pūjās to be performed on the conjunction of certain nakṣatras with certain tithis and week-days. A few examples are given here: when on a Sunday there is 14th tithi and Revati nakṣatra or when Aṣṭami and Maghā-nakṣatra are joined, one should worship Śiva and partake of sesame food and this is Ādityavrata that yields health to the performer and his sons and relatives. When there is conjunction of Rohiṇī and the Moon on 14th tithi, or of Aṣṭami and the Moon, that is Candravrata in which Śiva may be worshipped and <em>naivedya</em> of milk and curds be offered and one may subsist on milk and secure fame, health and prosperity. When Revati, Thursday and 14th tithi or Aṣṭami and Puṣya are joined, that is Guruvrata, on which one should subsist on the milk of a <em>kapilā</em> cow mixed with the fluid extracted from Brāhmi plants ; the person becomes master of speech. The Viṣṇudharmasūtra (chap. 90.1-15) deals with what is to be done when the Full Moon days of Mārg. to K. are in conjunction with the nakṣatra which gives the name to the month and the rewards of the observances thereon; vide Dānasāgara pp. 622-626, where V. Dh. is quoted and explained.</p>

<p><em>Nakṣatravratāni</em>-Agni 196, KKV 399-417, HV II. 593-706. KKV deals with only ten, while HV speaks of 33. Vratas connected with the nakṣatras from Aśvinī onwards are set out in HV. HK 126-128 and KN 327-328, NA 18 deal with question as to what should be done when a fast is to be observed in a vrata which is concerned with both tithi and nakṣatra. The rule is that the nakṣatra for fast must be existing at the time of sunset or at the time when there is a conjunction of the Moon with midnight (i.e. there is the required nakṣatra at midnight). The first of these two is the principal matter, the 2nd is only next best (anukalpa ). Vide Vi. Dh. I. 60. 26–27 for this rule q. by KN 327, HK 126, VKK 8.</p>

<p><em>Paurṇamāsı</em>&ndash;Many grants on the Full Moon days of M., K., Jy., and Ās ; vide E. I. vol. VII, Appendix Nos. 26-28, 30, 32, 33, 36 from śake 608 to 635 (686 to 723 A. D.). The word &lsquo;paurṇamāsi&rsquo; is derived as &lsquo;pūrṇo māḥ (&lsquo;mās&rsquo; means &lsquo;moon&rsquo;) pūrṇamāḥ, tatra bhavā paurṇamāsī (tithiḥ)&rsquo; or &lsquo;pūrṇo māso vartate asyām-iti paurṇamāsi&rsquo;; HV II. 160 says &lsquo;pūrṇamāso bhaved yasyām pūrṇamāsī tataḥ smṛtā&rsquo; (quoting Bhav. U.). Vide above p. 66 (pūrṇamāṣad-aṇ &amp;c.). When the Moon and Jupiter are seen together (in the same nakṣatra) on a Full Moon day, that Paurṇamāsi is called great (Mahā), gifts and fasts on such a paurṇamāsi yield inexhaustible merit (V. Dh. 49. 9–10 q. by KR pp. 430-431 and KKN 373); vide KV 346-347, HK 640, VKK 77 and Vi. Dh. I. 60.21 for a similar verse. Such a paurṇamāsi is called mahā-caitrī, mahā-kārtiki, mahā-pauṣi &amp;c. Vide Cintra praśasti of Sāraṅgadeva (of 20–1-1287 A. D.) for provision made for festival of Caitra full Moon and Bhādrapada Full Moon, in E. I. vol. I. p. 271 at p. 279. When Paurṇamāsi or Amāvāsyā is <em>viddhā</em> the tithi mixed with 1st tithi is to be accepted except in case of Vaṭasāvitri; KN 300-301, KTV 59-61, PC 281.</p>
<p><em>Paurṇamāsi-kr̥tya</em>&ndash;Vide KN 300-307, VKK 77-81, TT 133, SM 104-116, SmK 270–71.</p>
<p><em>Paurṇamāsi-vratas</em>-Vide Agni 194, KKV 374-385 (only five ), HV II. 160-245 ( about 38 ), SmK 432-439, PC 211-314, VR 587-645. Some unimportant matters about Full Moon tithi are mentioned here. On Āṣ. pūrṇimā, ascetics (<em>yatis</em>) are to shave their heads and not to shave during <em>cāturmāsya</em>, they are to stay in one place for four or two months from Āṣāḍhi and perform Vyāsapūjā (PC 284); on Śr. pūrṇimā <em>Upākarma</em>; on Bh. Full Moon śrāddha to be performed for <em>Nāndimukha</em> pitṛs; on M. pūrṇimā donate sesame; in Phā. theft of firewood allowed to boys from śu. 5th to 15th and fire is to be set to such wood on 15th (PC 309); V. Dh. (90.3-5) provides that if on Full Moon of P. there is Puṣya nakṣatra and a man bathes Vāsudeva image in ghee and himself applies white mustard paste to his body and bathes with water mixed with <em>sarvauṣadhi</em> and fragrant things and worships the image with mantras of Viṣṇu, Indra and Bṛhaspati he prospers (q. by KR 484).</p>
<p><em>Pauṣavratas</em>-KR 474-486, VKK 487-490, NS 211-12, SmK 432-439; some matters are briefly mentioned here. Stream of clarified butter in P. on Śiva (liṅga) from a vessel with song, dance and instrumental music and with illuminations makes the performer free from all sins and takes him to Śivaloka (KR 478); on P. śu. 8th with Wednesday, bath, japa, homa, feeding brāhmaṇas in worship of Śiva yields merit thousands of times (NS 211); fast on P. 9th of both <em>pakṣas</em> and worship of Durgā thrice in the day, nakta for whole month and bathing Durgā image in ghee, feeding eight maidens and worship of Durgā image made of flour, lead a man to Durgā-loka (KR 477 from Bhav.).</p>
<p><em>Pauṣṭika</em>-Br̥. S. 2 enumerates among the qualifications of the sāṁvatsara ( astrologer) that he should be well-versed in the śāntika and pauṣṭike rites. The difference between the two is: Pauṣṭika rites are homa and the like performed for longevity, while Śāntika rites are homa and the like performed for averting threatened evil influence of planets and danger foreboded by unusual occurrences like comets, meteor showers &amp;c.; NA 48. KKN 254 states that Śanti means the removal of worldly calamities by means of acts in accordance with Dharma (or Dharmaśāstra ).</p>

Dh. III. 129. 1-6).</p>
<p><em>Prajāpativrata</em>-in the Saṅkhāyana Br. VI, 6 it is said &lsquo;he should not see the Sun rising or setting&rsquo;. These rules are called Prajāpativrata by Śabara on Jai. IV. I 3 and he declares that they are &lsquo;puruṣārtha&rsquo; and not &lsquo;kratvartha&rsquo;; (2) In the Praśṇopaniṣad I. 13 and 15 it is said &lsquo;day is the prāṇa and the night the food of Prajāpati and those who have sexual intercourse by day attack prāṇa while those that have it by night are observing brahmacarya; that those who observe the Prajāpati-vrata produce children (a son and a daughter).&rsquo; In Praśṇa I. 15 Prajāpativrata means indulging in sexual intercourse only at night; this meaning is different from that given by Śabara.</p>
<p><em>Pratipad-vratas</em>&ndash;Agni 176 (only two vratas), KKV 35-40, HV I. 335-365; KN 140–149, PC 56-81, VR 49-78, HK 614 (quoting Bhav.) say the 1st tithis of Cai., K. and Āśv. are the holiest (also HV II. 350).

<p><em>Prātaḥ-snāna</em>-(bath in early morning ) BB (p. 350 verse 1530 ) and RM (verse 1361, ABORI vol. 36 p, 33 ) state that one should always bathe early morning when the Sun is in Tulā ( Balance ), Makara ( Capricorn) and Meṣa (Ram). This is quoted by KR 149 from RM and by VKK 240 (from Bhav.); V. Dh. 64. 8 directs that one who undertakes prātaḥsnāna must bathe when he sees eastern quarter suffused with the rays of Aruṇa.</p>

<p><em>Pritivrata</em>-one who omits taking oil bath for four months from Āṣāḍha and then donates food with condiments goes to Viṣṇuloka; Mat. 101. 6 q. by KKV 40.</p>
<p><em>Pretacaturdaśī</em>—on 14 of K. kr̥., the vrata is begun to be performed at night; if in addition there is Tuesday and Citrā nakṣatra, the merit is far greater; Śiva is deity; if 14th is viddhā, the day on which 14th exists at night is to be preferred; fast on 14th and worship of Śiva and dinner to devotees of Śiva and gifts; by bath in Ganges on this tithi, one becomes free from all sins; one should whirl over one&rsquo;s head a twig of apāmārga plant and engage in tarpaṇa of Yama uttering his names (14 in all ); one should light rows of lamps on a river, in temples of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva, houses where four roads meet; the performer reaches Śivaloka together with 21 generations of his family; on this tithi firebrands are lighted for persons of the family that died by wounds from arms and for others on amāvāsyā; the performer listens to the story called Pretopākhyāna ( of five <em>pretas</em> which a brāhmaṇa met in a desert ) set out from Saṁvatsarapradipa (in VKK 461-467 ) which was narrated by Bhiṣma to Yudhiṣṭhira about the actions by which a man is reduced to the condition of a <em>preta</em> (a disembodied spirit, a ghost), and the actions which relieve him from that condition; the performer should also partake of 14 vegetables that are enumerated in Kṛtyacintāmani set out in Introduction (p.

This was probably named Pretacaturdaśī because Pretopākhyāna was to be recited on it.</p>

<p><em>Bhimadvādaśi</em>-(1) It was first imparted to Bhima, one of the Pāndavas, by Vāsudeva and came to be known by his name; this was formerly called Kalyāṇini. It is elaborately described in Mat. 69. 19-65 (which also occur in Pad. V. 23), most of which are q. by KKV 354-359 (from Mat.) and HV I. 1044-1049 (from Pad.); on 10th of M. śu. bath with ghee applied to the body and worship of Viṣṇu with the words (namo Nārāyaṇāya), the various limbs of Viṣṇu being honoured with different names (Kr̥ṣṇa, Dāmodara &amp;c.), worship of Garuḍa, of Śiva, Gaṇeśa; total fast on 11th; on 12th bathe in a river and raise maṇḍapa in front of house; hang a jar full of water from a <em>toraṇa</em> with a small hole at the bottom and take the drops on one&rsquo;s hand the whole night; <em>homa</em> through four priests learned in Ṛgveda, Rudra-japa by four Yajurvedins and <em>sāmans</em> to be sung by Sāmavedins; these twelve priests to be honoured with rings, garments &amp;c.; on next tithi donate 13 cows; after priests go he should say &lsquo;May Keśava be pleased, and Viṣṇu is the heart of Śiva and Śiva is the heart of Viṣṇu&rsquo;; should listen to <em>itihāsa</em> and <em>purāṇa</em>; vide Gar. I. 127 for this; (2) on M. śu. 12; this was imparted by Pulastya to Bhima, king of Vidarbha and father of Damayanti wife of Nala: arrangements as in the preceding; performer freed from all sins; this vrata is superior to Vājapeya and Atirātra &amp;c. HV. 1049–1056 ( from Bhav. U.).</p>
<p><em>Bhimavrata</em>-one who having fasted for a month donates at end a fine cow reaches the world of Viṣṇu; Mat. 101. 51 q. by KKV 446, HV II. 884 (from Pad. ).</p>
<p><em>Bhimaikādaśī</em>&ndash;M. śu. 11th joined with Puṣya or without it is very sacred and dear to Viṣṇu. Dhaumya describes to Bhima in Pad. VI. 239. 28 ff.</p>
<p><em>Bhiṣmapañcaka</em>&ndash;For five days from 11th tithi of K. śu.; performer bathes three times applying pañcāmṛta, pañcagavya and water mixed with sandalwood paste; tarpaṇa of pitṛs with yava, rice and sesame; 108 times repeat the mantra &lsquo;om namo Vāsudevāyā&rsquo; at worship and when performing homa offer sesame, yava and rice mixed with ghee with mantra of six letters &lsquo;om namo Viṣṇave&rsquo;; this procedure to be followed for five days; on the 1st to 5th day the feet, knees, navel, shoulders and head of Hari should respectively be worshipped with lotuses, bilva leaves, bhṛṅgāraka, (on 4th day ) <em>bāṇa</em>, <em>bilva</em> and Jayā, Mālati; on 11th to 14th he should respectively partake of cow-dung, cow urine, milk and curds for purifying the body; then on 5th day performer to feast brāhmaṇas and give gifts; the performer&rsquo;s sins are all wiped out; HV II, 336-341 (from Nār. and Bhav. U., the first saying that Bhiṣma learnt it from Kr̥ṣṇa, while the latter makes Kr̥ṣṇa declare that he learnt it from Bhiṣma when the veteran hero was lying on his bed of arrows); Bhav. U. allows the performer to eat vegetables and the food of ascetics. KV 324 cites the last verse occurring in HV II. 34 from Bhav. U. Later medieval works like NS 204, SM 158-159, SmK 386 add (from Pad.) that <em>arghya</em> and water should be offered to Bhiṣma by men of all varṇas and the tarpaṇa mantra is note-worthy &lsquo;Vaiyāghra-padya gotrāya Sāṅkṛtyapravarāya ca। Gaṅgā-putrāya Bhīṣmāya pradāsyeham tilodakam ॥ aputrāya dadāmyetat salilam Bhiṣmavarmaṇe।&rsquo;. These occur in BB p. 364 verses 1714-15 and the verse &lsquo;Vaiyāghra&rsquo; occurs in RM (vide ABORI vol. 36 p. 332 ) and in HK 628. By doing this a man becomes free from sins. Vide Agni 205. 1-9, Gar. I. 123. 3-11, Pad. VI. 125. 29–82 that contain a very elaborate description of this vrata.</p>
<p><em>Bhiṣmāṣṭamī</em>-on M. śu. 8; offer water and śrāddha every year to Bhīṣma who died a bachelor; he who does so becomes free from sins committed in one year and secures progeny; HK 628-29, VKK 503, TT 58, NS 221, SM 61. One whose father is alive also can offer water to Bhīṣma (SM 61 ). This tithi is probably based on Anuśāsanaparva 167, 28 ( Māghoyaṁ samanuprāpto &hellip; tribhāgaśeṣah pakṣoyam śuklo bhavitumarhati). With great respect to Prof. P. C. SenGupta I must say that his interpretation of &lsquo;samanuprāpta&rsquo; as &lsquo;samanupraviṣta&rsquo; is quite wrong and unwarranted and it is not possible to accept his conclusion that Bhisma died on 8th of dark half of Māgha and not on 8th of bright half. Vide his paper in JASB vol. XX No. 1 ( Letters ) pp. 39-41 (1954). The Bhujabalanibandha p. 364 has two verses, which are quoted in TT, NS and other works &rsquo; शुक्लाष्टम्यां तु माघस्य दद्याद् भीष्माय यो जलम् । संवत्सरकृतं पापं तत्क्षणादेव नश्यति ॥ वैयाघ्रपद्य गोत्राय सांकृतिप्रवराय च । अपुत्राय ददाम्येतत्सलिलं भीष्मवर्मणे ॥&rsquo;. Even brāhmaṇas were called upon to offer water to the noble kṣatriya warrior Bhīṣma.</p>

<p><em>Bhūtamātryutsava</em>–From 1st to pūrṇimā of Jy.; HV II. 365–370. same as Udasevikā. The Sarasvatikaṇṭhābharaṇa of Bhoja (V.94) on Poetics mentions it among <em>krīḍās</em>. Bhrātṛbhāṇḍā, Bhūtamātā and Udasevikā are three names of one utsava (HV II. 367 ).</p>

There is a pun on Kujanmā that has two senses (1) &lsquo;born on an inauspicious day&rsquo;, (2) &lsquo;born of the earth&rsquo;. As Mars is red in appearance, copper, red cloth and saffron are used to match his colour; HV II. 567 (from Bhav. U.); (2) worship Mars on Tuesday; repeat in the morning the several names of Mars ( 21 in all, such as Maṅgala, Kuja, Lohita, favouring Sāmavedins, Yama); draw a triangular figure with a hole in the middle and draw three names ( Āra, Vakra, Kuja ) with saffron and red sandalwood paste on each angle; Mars was born in Ujjayini in a Bhāradvāja family and rides a ram; if a man performs this vrata throughout life he becomes prosperous, has sons and grandsons and reaches the world of the planets; HV II. 568-574 (from Pad.); VKD 443-451 has a far more elaborate procedure of Bhaumavāra-vratapūjā.</p>
<p><em>Bhrātr̥dvitiya</em>&ndash;on K. śu. 2; it is also called Yamadvitiyā because in ancient times Yamunā treated her brother Yama to a dinner on this day; some works like KT 453, Vratārka, VR 98-101 combine the two viz. worship of Yama and dining at one&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s house. Vide pp. 209-210 above for the latter.</p>
<p><em>Maṅgala</em>&ndash;Acc. to Atharvaṇapariśiṣṭa q. by HV II, 626 brāhmaṇa, cow, fire, land, mustard, clarified butter, śami, grains of rice and barley are eight auspicious things. Droṇaparva 127. 14 speaks of eight maṅgalas; Droṇa 82, 20-22 contains a much longer list. Vā 14. 36-37 enumerate several things as auspicious which should be touched when going out of one&rsquo;s house viz. dūrvā, clarified butter, curds, jar full of water, cow with calf, bull, gold, clay, cow dung, svastika, akṣata grains, oil, honey, brāhmaṇa maidens, white flowers, śami, fire, Sun&rsquo;s disc, sandalwood and aśvattha tree (q. by Sm.

I. chap. 133. 3-18 and chap. 134; Kālikāpurāṇa (chap. 62 ) speaks of Mahānavami and pūjā thereof; and also Gar. I. 133, 3–18 and chap. 134;. E.

<p><em>Mahāmāghi</em>-When the Sun is in Śravaṇa nakṣatra and the Moon in Maghā it is called Mahāmāghi, acc. to R. M. 1366 ( vide ABORI. vol. 36 p. 331 for three verses on Māghisnāna) and it adds that in Māgha waters exclaim when the Sun is just risen &lsquo;what great sinner, whether a drinker of <em>surā</em> or murderer of a brāhmaṇa, shall we purify&rsquo;, This verse is q. by VKK 490 from Bhav. and by Smk 439 (from Pad.); PC ( 313-314) says that when Saturn is in Meṣa (Ram), the Moon and Jupiter in Siṁha (Lion) and the Sun is in Śravaṇa-nakṣatra then it is Mahāmāghi. Vide NS 221 for other views. This verse emphasizes the importance of Māghasnāna at Prayāga and other holy rivers and in holy tanks in early morning for the removal of sins, Vide H. of Dh. vol. IV p. 617 for Māghasnāna. In Tamil country &lsquo;Makha&rsquo; is an annual temple festival and Mahāmakha occurs once in twelve years, when a great meļā is held at Kumbhakoṇam for a bath in a tank there called mahāmagha tank, the meļā being comparable to the Kumbhamelā at Prayāga. This festival is popularly known as &lsquo;Mamaṅgam&rsquo; and takes place when the Full Moon is in Maghānakṣatra and Jupiter is in Maghā or in the sign of Lion. It fell on 23th February in 1955 according to south Indian Almanacs. It is reported that about a million people took a bath this year in eight to ten hours from 2 A. M. in the Mahāmakham tank at Kumbhakoṇam from which muddy water was pumped out and in which fresh water from the Kāverī river was made to flow.</p>
<p>It is surprising that hardly any medieval digest refers either to the Mahāmakham festival or the Kumbhameļā. The great emperor Harṣa used to hold once every five years a great meļā at Prayāga on the great sandy plain to the west of the <em>saṅgam</em> on the site where the Kumbhameļā is held in modern times and distributed the accumulations in his treasury.</p>
<p><em>Mahāmārgaśirṣi</em>-Vide above under Kārtika for prefixing &lsquo;Mahā&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Mahārājavrata</em>-When 14th tithi ( of śu. or kṛ. ) falls on Ārdrā nakṣatra or when it is joined to Pūrvābhādrapadā and Uttarābhādrapadā or both, that tithi gives pleasure to Śiva; saṅkalpa on preceding 13th, on 14th bath one after another with sesame, cow&rsquo;s urine and dung, clay, pañcagavya and then with pure water; then <em>japa</em> 1000 times of Śivasaṅkalpa mantra (&lsquo;Yaj-jāgrato dūram&rsquo;, Śivasankalpopaniṣad, 8) for three varṇas and om namaḥ Śivāya&rsquo; for śūdras; bath of images of Śiva and Umā with pañcāmṛta, pañcagavya, sugarcane juice and applying to the images unguents like musk, saffron &amp;c.; rows of lamps; <em>homa</em> with thousands of bilva leaves while repeating Śivasaṅkalpa or the mantra &lsquo;Tryambakam yajāmahe&rsquo; (R̥g.

I. 8.6 2 ); arghya to Śiva with mantras (set out); jāgara whole night; gift of five or two cows or one; after partaking of pañcagavya the performer should dine in silence; all obstacles are removed and he reaches highest goal; HV II. 1039–1047 (from Skanda).</p>
<p><em>Mahālakṣmīpūjā</em>—There are varying views about this vrata. KSS p. 19 and A. K (folio 535b-539b ) say-begin on Bh. śu. 8 and finish on Āś, kṛ. 8 (by Pūrṇimānta reckoning) and that it is to last for 16 days, on each of which Mahālakṣmi was to be worshipped and stories about her were to be listened to. Vide N. S. pp. 153–154, where a similar period is prescribed but it is said that one should, if beginning this vrata for the first time, avoid four <em>doṣas</em>, viz. there should not be avamadina, the tithi should not be tryahaspṛk, should not be mixed with 9th tithi, nor should the Sun be in the half of Hasta nakṣatra. In Mahārāṣṭra the pūjā of Mahālakṣmi is performed on Āś. śu. 8th by young married women at noon and at night all married women join in worship and hold big empty jars in their hands, breathe into them and bend their bodies in various ways; P.C.

<p><em>Māgha-kṛtya</em>-KR 487-514, VKK 490-514, NS 213-221, SmK 439-513, GK 37-41. There are several important vratas in Māgha such as Tilacaturthi, Rathasaptamī, Bhiṣmāṣṭami which would be separately mentioned in this list. A few small matters may be briefly disposed off here. M. śu. 4 is called Umācaturthī because Gauri is to be worshipped by men and specially by women with Kunda and other flowers, with offerings of jaggery, salt, <em>yāvaka</em> and one should honour women who are not widows, brāhmaṇas and cows (KKN 437-38, KR 503 ); on M. kṛ. 12th Yama produced sesame and Daśaratha brought them to the earth and sowed them and Viṣṇu was made lord of sesame by the gods, hence one should fast on that day and worship Hari with sesame, offer homa with sesame, donate them and eat them (V. Dh. 90. 19, KKN 435-6, KR 495-96); on M. amāvāsyā, if it is present on Monday morning, men and particularly women in Tamil country circumbulate the <em>aśvattha</em> tree and make gifts.</p>
<p><em>Māghasaptami</em>-on M. śu. 7; one should bathe at <em>aruṇodaya</em> in a river or other running water after placing on his head seven leaves of the <em>badara</em> tree and seven of the <em>arka</em> plant; then offer arghya to the Sun with water mixed with seven <em>badara</em> fruit, <em>arka</em> leaves, rice, sesame, dūrvā, <em>akṣatas</em> and sandalwood, bow to Saptami as Devi, then to the Sun. Some held that this snāna and Māghasnāna were not separate, while others held that the two were quite separate; KR 509, VKK 499-502, KT 459, RM (ABORI vol. 36 p. 332, three verses ).</p>
<p><em>Māghasnāna</em>—bath in Māgha in the Ganges or in any other fine stream in the early morning is highly eulogised from early times. The best time is dawn when the nakṣatras are still visible, next best is the time when stars are visible but the Sun is not actually risen and the inferior time is after the Sun rises. The beginning for the month&rsquo;s bathing should be made on the 11th of P. śu. or on P. pūrṇimā (according to the pūrṇimānta reckoning) and the vrata (for one month ) is to be finished on the 12th of M. śu. or pūrṇimā; some bring it in line with the <em>Saura</em> reckoning by providing that bath when the Sun is in Makara ( Capricorn) in Māgha in the morning leads sinners to heaven (VKK 491 quoting Pad.); all men and women are entitled to engage in it. The most meritorious Māghasnāna is at the confluence of the Gangā and Yamunā. Vide for details, Pad. VI (in which about 2800 verses are devoted from chap. 219 to 250 to the māhātmya of Māghasnāna ), HV II. 789-794, VKK 490-91, RM 1368 ( ABORI vol. 36 p. 332 ), NS 213-216, Smk 439-441 and H. of Dh. vol. IV. 617; Pad. VI. 237. 49-59 and KT 455-57 describe the procedure of the gifts and <em>niyamas</em>. V. Dh. 90 last verse eulogises morning bath in M. and Phā. Vide 1. A. vol. XI p. 88 on &lsquo;Māghameļā&rsquo;.</p>
<p><em>Mātṛvrata</em>-(1) on 8th; tithi; Mātṛs ( mother goddesses ) are the deity; one should fast on this day and ask their pardon with devotion; they bestow welfare and health ; HV I. 876 (from Vai.); (2) on Āśv. 9th a king and members of all castes should worship the Mātṛs (many enumerated) and attain success; a woman whose children don&rsquo;t live or who has a single child is blessed with progeny; HV I. 951-52.</p>
<p><em>Mārgapāli-bandhana</em>-on K. śu. 1; vide p. 205 above.</p>
<p><em>Mārgaśirṣakṛtya</em>-Vide KR 442-474, VKK 482-487, NS 209-211, SmK 427-432. The whole of the month is held sacred in the Tamil country and <em>bhajan</em> parties go round the whole morning; the Gitā (X. 35 ) avers that Mārg. is the best among months and identifies it with Lord Kr̥ṣṇa. Some of the less important matters may be noted here. In Kṛtayuga the gods began the year on the first tithi of Mārg, and the sage Kāśyapa created the beautiful Kāśmira country; therefore celebration should be held on it (KR 452 ); Mārg. śu. 12 a person should fast on the 12th tithi on each dvādaśī for a year from Mārg. to K. and should on each dvādaśī dwell on one of the twelve names of Viṣṇu from Keśava to Dāmodara and offer worship; he becomes <em>jātismara</em> (one who recollects actions of previous lives) and reaches that place from which there is no return to this mortal world (Anuśāsana, chap. 109, Bṛ. S. 104.14-16); on Mārg. pūrṇimā the Moon should be specially worshipped as the Moon was sprinkled with nectar on that day, cows should be given salt, one&rsquo;s mother, sister, daughter and female relatives in one&rsquo;s family should be honoured with a pair of new garments, a festival with dance and songs should be held, those who drink wine should taste fresh wine that day; KKN 432–33, KR 471-72. For Dattātreyajayanti on Mārg. Full Moon, vide above p. 310.</p>
<p><em>Mārtaṇḍasaptami</em>&ndash;begin on P. śu. 7; fast on that day, worship of the Sun and muttering the word &lsquo;Mārtaṇḍa&rsquo;; performer to partake for purifying himself of cow&rsquo;s urine or dung or curds or milk; on next day worship of the Sun under the name &lsquo;Ravi&rsquo;; in this way for a year he should proceed for two days each month and give grass and the like for feeding a cow one day; he reaches the world of the Sun; Bhav.I. 109. 1-13 q. by HV I. 754–55, KKN 147–148.</p>
<p><em>Māsavrata</em>-during the 12 months from Mārg. to K. the performer should respectively donate the following; salt, ghee, sesame, seven dhānyas, coloured or charming garments, wheat, jar full of water, sandalwood paste with camphor, butter, umbrella, <em>laḍḍukas</em> enriched with sugar or jaggery, lamps; at end of year donate a cow and worship Durgā, Brahmā, the Sun, or Viṣṇu; HV II. 853-54 (from Devipurāṇa), KR 442-443.</p>

<p><em>Viṣṭivrata or Viṣṭibhadrā</em>—The <em>karaṇas</em> will be described in the section on Kāla. They are of two classes, <em>cara</em> ( moveable ) and <em>sthira</em> (fixed). The first are seven of which Viṣṭi is one. Vide Bṛ. S. 99. 1. Visṭi is half of a tithi. The works on astrology raised it to the status of an ill-formed malignant demoness. Viṣṭi comprised 30 ghaṭikās which were distributed unevenly in her mouth, throat, heart, navel, waist and tail (respectively 5, 1, 11, 4, 6, 3 ghaṭikās ); HV II. 719-724 (from Bhav. U.), KN 330, SmK 565-566 describe her as the daughter of the Sun and sister of Saturn, she has the mouth of an ass, three feet &amp;c. Viṣṭi was generally destructive and was to be avoided for any auspicious undertaking, but it was a favourable time for destroying enemies or poisoning them (Bṛ. S. 99. 4); fast on the day that has Viṣṭi; but if Viṣṭi occurs at night then ekabhakta may be resorted to on two days; worship gods and pitṛs and then image of Viṣṭi made of <em>darbhas</em> with flowers &amp;c.; naivedya is of <em>kṛśara</em>( dish of rice and peas and spices, <em>Marathi khicaḍi</em> ); gift of dark garment, dark cow and dark blanket. Viṣṭi and Bhadrā mean the same thing. Vide HV II. 719-724, KN 330, Sm K 565-566.</p>
<p><em>Viṣṇu</em>-Vi. Dh. III. 123 lays down what names of Viṣṇu should be taken on certain occasions, such as crossing a river (when one is to remember Matsya, Kūrma and Varāha), or when the planets or nakṣatras are unfavourable or when one is in danger from robbers and tigers &amp;c. ( remember name Nṛsiṁha ); Vi. Dh.

<p><em>Viṣṇuśayanotsava</em>&ndash;The festival on the sleeping of Viṣṇu either on the 11th or 12th of Āṣ. śu.; NS 102; vide above pp. 109 110 for Viṣṇuśayana. This is not to be performed in intercalary month.</p>

<p><em>Vr̥kṣotsavavidhi</em>-Great importance was attached to the planting of trees. Mat. 59 ( verses 1-20 same as Pad. V. 24. 192–211 ) contains the procedure of tree festival. It is briefly as follows:-trees in a garden should be sprinkled with <em>sarvaușadhi</em> water, decked with fragrant powder and flowers and cloth should be wound round them; the trees should be pierced with a golden needle (imitating karṇavedha) and collyrium applied to them with a golden pencil; on the platforms of trees seven or eight golden fruits should be placed, jars containing pieces of gold should be established under the trees: homa to be offered to Indra, Lokapālas and Vanaspati; a milch cow covered with white cloth decked with gold ornaments and having horns tipped with gold should be let loose from the midst of trees; the performer (owner of the trees) should honour all priests with gifts of cows, golden chains, rings, clothes &amp;c. and feed brāhmaṇas with a dinner full of milk for four days; <em>homa</em> with yavas, black sesame and mustard and <em>palāśa</em> fuel sticks and festival on 4th day; performer reaps all desires. Mat. 154. 512 states that a son is equal to ten deep reservoirs of water and a tree planted is equal to ten sons. It is said by Var. (172. 36-37 ) that just as a good son saves his family, so a tree laden with flowers and fruits saves its owner from falling into hell, and that one who plants five mango trees does not go to Hell; Vi. Dh. (III. 297. 13) remarks about trees &lsquo;a single tree nurtured by a man performs what a son would do in that it gratifies gods with its flowers, travellers with its shade, men with its fruits; there is no fall in hell for the planter of a tree.&rsquo;</p>
<p><em>Vr̥ntāka-tyāga-vidhi</em>-it involves the abstention from eating vr̥ntāka (fruit of egg-plant) for a life-time or a year or six or three months; fast on Bharaṇi or Maghā nakṣatra for one night; invoke the presence of Yama, Kāla, Citragupta, Mr̥tyu and Prajāpati on an altar and worship with <em>gandha</em> &amp;c.; homa with sesame and ghee with svāhā to Yama, Nila, Nilakaṇṭha, Yamarāja, Citragupta, Vaivasvata ; 108 <em>āhutis</em>; gift of a vṛntāka made of gold, dark cow and bull, finger rings, ear-rings, umbrella, sandals, a pair of dark garments and dark blanket; dinner to brāhmaṇas who pronounce blessings; he who gives up vṛntāka for life goes to Viṣṇuloka; one who performs this for a year or a month even does not see the city of Yama; it is a <em>prakirṇaka</em> vrata; HV II. 909–910 ( from Bhav. U.).</p>
<p><em>Vr̥ndāvanadvādaśi</em>-on K. śu. 12 observed in Tamil lands.</p>
<p><em>Vr̥ṣabhavrata</em>-(1) fast on 7th śu.; on 8th gift of a bull covered with two white garments and decked with ornaments (bell &amp;c.); tithivrata; Śiva deity; the performer reaches Śivaloka and thereafter becomes king; HV I. 882 (from Bhav. U.); (2) worship of bulls on Jy. Amāvāsyā; manufacture wooden bulls the previous day and establish them in one&rsquo;s own house and worship with <em>gandha</em> &amp;c.; prayer to bulls calling them Dharma. Dharma is often spoken of as vr̥ṣa as in Manu VIII, 16 ( = Sāntiparva 90.15.</p>
<p><em>Vr̥ṣavrata</em>-(1) the same as Viṣṇuvrata (2) above; KKV 448 quoting Mat. 101. 64; (3) on K. pūrṇimā let loose a bull and obserye nakta; tithi; Śiva deity; performer reaches Śivaloka; HV II. 242 (from Pad. one verse ).</p>

The most frequent letting loose of a bull takes place on the 11th day after the death of a person. For treatment thereof, vide H. of Db. IV. pp. 539– 542. The same subject is treated at length in HV II. 983-997, SmK 390-405.</p>
<p><em>Vedavrata</em>-This is a Caturmūrtivrata; from Cai. one should worship R̥gveda and should subsist by nakta way and listen to its recitation and on last day of Jy. donate two garments, gold, cow, bell-metal vessel full of ghee; in Āṣ, Śr, Bh. he should observe Yajurveda vrata, in Āśv, K. and Mārg. Sāmaveda vrata and in P., M, Phā. for all vedas; this is really worship of Vāsudeva who is the soul of the Vedas; perform for twelve years; becomes free from all trouble and goes to Viṣṇuloka; HV II, 827-28 (from Vi. Dh. III, 141.1-7).</p>
<p><em>Veśyāvrata</em>-HV II. pp. 541-548 (quoting Bhav. U.) deals with this vrata and contains the startling story narrated by Kr̥ṣṇa to Yudhiṣṭhira that the former cursed his 16000 wives, when he noticed their erotic emotion roused by the charms of his son Sāmba, that after his death <em>dasyus</em> would kidnap them and the story of a prior curse pronounced by sage Nārada on Apsarases who proudly did not bow to him that they would have Nārāyaṇa as their husband but that ultimately they would be kidnapped by robbers and become Veśyās ( prostitutes ). The long and short of this story is that they were advised to follow the profession in palaces and temples, that they should not love any male who has no wealth, but that they should have as their sole object wealth, whether the man who approached them was handsome or ugly. It is further stated that they should make gifts of cows, fields, gold to brāhmaṇas, should bathe with <em>sarvauṣadhi</em> water when on a Sunday there is Hasta, Puṣya or Punarvasu nakṣatra and offer worship to Kāmadeva from the feet to the head, that they should worship Cupid as Viṣṇu, honour a brāhmaṇa learned in the Veda with gift of a <em>prastha</em> of husked rice grains and render their person to him on Sunday as above for a year and in the 13th month make a gift of bedstead, gold chain and an image of Kāmadeva; this is the vrata for all Veśyās; this is vāravrata; Anaṅga (god of love) is devatā; KKV (27-31) has this vrata and calls it Veśyādityavārānaṅgadāna-vrata.</p>
<p>_Vaikuṇṭhacaturdaśi-1) K. Śu. 14 is called Vaikuṇṭha; if worship of Viṣṇu is to be done it should take place at night; NS 206; (2) on K, śu. 14 in the cyclic year Hemalamba at the time of Aruṇodaya and on Brāhma <em>muhūrta</em> Lord Viśveśvara himself is said to have bathed in Maṇikarṇikā at Banaras, performed Pāśupatavrata and together with Umā worshipped Viśveśvara and established Viśveśvara; NS 206, SmK 388-389, PC 246-247.</p>
<p><em>Vaitaraṇīvrata</em>&ndash;Marg. kr̥. 11th tithi is called Vaitaraṇi; one should undertake <em>niyamas</em>( restrictions) for this vrata on that tithi; at night he should worship a dark cow from its front foot to its tail; apply sandalwood paste to its body, wash its feet and horns with water scented with sandalwood paste and worship its limbs with Paurānika mantras; since one crosses the Vaitaraṇi river of the nether world by means of a cow, so this ekādaśī on which cow is honoured is so called; this vrata is for one year in three periods of four months, in which naivedya of boiled rice, of cooked barley and of pāyasa is offered respectively in 4 months from Mārg., in four months from Cai. and in 4 months from Śr.; one third of each naivedya is to be given to the cow, to the priest and to the performer; at end of one year gift of bedstead and a golden cow to the priest and one <em>droṇa</em> of iron; HV I. 1110-1112 (from Bhav. U.), Vratārka 230a-231b ( notes that it is well-known in Gurjara-deśa). Pad. (VI. 68. 28 ff) describes this but says that Mārg. kr̥. 12th is Vaitaraṇi.</p>
<p><em>Vaināyaka-vrata</em>-on every 4th tithi practise nakta for a year; at end of year donate an elephant; tithivrata; Gaṇeśa deity; leads to Śivaloka; Mat. 101. 61 quoted (with variations ) by KKV 448 and HV I. 532 ( from Pad.).</p>
<p><em>Vaiśākha-kr̥tya</em>—Vide HV II, 748-750, KR 145-179, VKK 240-259, KT 423-430, NS 90-97, SmK 108-117, GK 15-23. Some of the vratas in Vaiśākha, such as Akṣayyatr̥tīyā have been separately mentioned. Other small matters are briefly dealt with here. In this month morning bath, particularly in holy rivers, is specially commended along with baths when the Sun is in Tula ( Balance ) or Makara (Capricorn). Vide RM (ABORI vol. 36 R. 331 &lsquo;Tulā makara&rsquo;&amp;c.), KR 149 (quoting &lsquo;Tulāmakarameṣeṣu prātaḥ snānam vidhiyate ), KV 423-424, SmK 106, 108. The <em>prātaḥsnāna</em> may be begun on Caitra Full Moon or on the ekādaśī or Full Moon of Vaiśākha ( NS 90 ); for māhātmya of Vaiśākha-snāna, vide Pad. IV. 85. 41-70 saying that early morning bath in Vai, is equal to Aśvamedha; on śu. 7 the worship of the Ganges, as it was let off on this tithi from his right ear by Jahnu who drank it up in anger (KKN 387, Pad. IV. 85. 41-42, NS 95, SmK 112 ); on Vai. śu. 7 Buddha was born and his image should be worshipped for three days from that tithi, especially when it has Puṣya nakṣatra ( KKN 388, KR 160 ). On śu. 8 worship of Durgā called Aparājitā after bathing image with water containing camphor and Jaṭāmāmsi and the performer himself should bathe with the juice of mangoes (NA 56, SmK 113); on Vai. pūrṇimā, white and dark sesame were produced by Brahmā, therefore one should bathe with water mixed with them, offer in fire sesame, donate sesame and <em>madhu</em> ( honey) and Vessels full of sesame (KKN 388, HV II, 167–171, KR 163-164, SmK 115–116, NS 97); vide V. Dh. 90. 10 for a similar provision. The Vaiśākha-pūjā of Buddha was started in Ceylon under Duttha-gāmaṇi (about 100–77 B. C.); vide &rsquo; Buddhism in Ceylon&rsquo; by Walpola Rāhula (Colombo, 1956 ) p. 80.</p>

<p><em>Śrāvaṇa-kr̥tya</em>-KKN 395-397, KR 218–254, VKK 292, KT 437-438; NS 109-122, Sm K 148-200, PC 215–22.</p>
<p>There are several important vratas in Śrāvaṇa such as Nāgapancami, Aśūnyaśayanavrata, Kr̥ṣṇajanmāṣṭami, which have already been described or have been included separately in this list. A few small matters are briefly mentioned here. A notion prevailed that all rivers except those that fall directly into the sea are <em>rajasvalā</em> (&lsquo;muddy&rsquo; or with a pun &lsquo;in monthly course&rsquo;) when the Sun is in the middle of the signs of Cancer and Lion and therefore one was not to bathe in them for holiness and that streams that are not 1008 <em>dhanus</em> in length are not to be called &rsquo;nadīs&rsquo; (rivers) but they are merely holes or canals ( gartā). Vide Gobhilasmr̥ti I. 141-142 (Māsadvayaṁ Śrāvaṇādi &amp;c.), NS 109-110; vide H. of Dh. vol. IV. 590 note 1337 for the length of <em>dhanus</em> (as 4 hastas). In Śr, the several deities had on different tithis the <em>pavitrāropaṇarrata</em> (for which vide pp. 339-340 above); on Mondays in Śr. one should either fast or take only one meal at night (SmK 139); on 9th of both fortnights worship Durgā under the name of Kaumārī (KR 244, SmK 200); on Śr. kr̥. 1 all Vaidika brāhmaṇas have to engage in japa of Gāyatri for 1008 times in Tamil lands as their almanac shows. Śrāvaṇa amāvāsyā is called <em>kuśoṭpāṭini</em> as kuśas are gathered then (KR 316, SmK 252). On this amāvāsyā childless women or women whose children die in infancy perform a vrata for getting a child viz. they observe fast, establish eight <em>kalaśas</em> (jars) for images of Brahmāṇī and other Mother Goddesses.</p>
<p><em>Śrāvaṇikāvrata</em>-on 8th and 14th of Mārg. śu.; after bath at mid-day performer should invite several maidens or one maiden ( if he be poor) or chaste brāhmaṇa sagotra women and one learned and well-conducted brāhmaṇa, wash the latter&rsquo;s feet and give <em>arghya</em> and honour with gandha &amp;c. and a sumptuous dinner; he should place twelve water Vessels covered with threads and garlands before the maidens and should place one vessel on his own head and contemplate on Keśava and pray that he may be freed from all his debts to <em>pitr̥s</em>, gods and men; the women should reply &lsquo;so be it&rsquo;; tithivrata ; deities are goddesses called Śrāvaṇyaḥ who report to Brahmā whatever good or evil a man utters; HV II. 134-139 ( from Bhav.

<p><em>Ṣaṣṭivratas</em>-Sixty vratas occur in Mat. 101.1-83 (q. by KKV 439-451 ). All these are said to have been narrated by Rudra to his spouse.</p>
<p><em>Ṣaṣṭhidevi</em>-BRV II (chap. 43.3-72) says that Ṣaṣṭhi, Maṅgalacaṇḍi and Manasā are portions of Prakr̥ti, that Ṣaṣṭhi is the presiding goddess over children, that she is called Devasenā among Mātr̥s, she is wife of Skanda, protects children and gives them long life and narrates a story about worship of that goddess on the 6th day after birth in the lying-In chamber.

When the sixth is mixed up with 5th or 7th the general rule is that in the case of vratas and fasts sixth mixed with the 7th is to be chosen except in the case of Skandaṣaṣṭhi where sixth mixed with 5th is to be preferred (KN 190, NA 48, SM 42, PC 100-101 ); the sixth tithi is dear to Kārtikeya (or Skanda ) who was born on it and became the commander-in-chief of the gods on it; Bhav. I. 39. 1-13, HK 622 ( quoting Brah.), KKN 382-383.</p>
<p>One or two special matters may be noted. Skanda is the lord of 6th tithi and is to be worshipped on every 6th tithi with fragrant flowers, lamps, garments, crows as toys, bell, <em>chowries</em> and mirror; Kārtikeya is specially to be always worshipped by kings with campaka flowers and no other god ( KR 276 ); 6th of Mārg. śu. is called Mahāṣaṣṭhi (HK 623-624). Vide Nār. I. 45. 1-51 for Ṣaṣṭhivrata in the twelve months of the year.</p>
<p><em>Saṁvatsaravrata</em>&ndash;begin on 5th of Cai. śu. in the year called Saṁvatsara and go on for five days. Agni, the Sun, Soma, Prajāpati and Maheśvara are identified with the five years of a Yuga viz.

X. 90), Nār. and numerous Paurāṇika mantras are relied upon and 16 upacāras offered; Gaṇeśa is worshipped with 21 names and the same number of <em>dūrvā</em> tendrils, leaves of plants (such as <em>Bhr̥ṅgarāja,bilva</em>, badarī, dhattūra, sami and flowers (red); there is also worship with 108 names of gaṇapati; at end five <em>modakas</em> to be offered to the priest and dakṣiṇā; it is said that Vyāsa narrated this vrata to Yudhiṣṭhira. Saṅkaṣṭa appears to mean distress or calamity. &ldquo;Kaṣṭa&rsquo; means &lsquo;kleśa&rsquo; and the prefixing of &lsquo;sam&rsquo; makes it a little more emphatic.</p>
<p><em>Saṅkrāntivratas</em>-Vide HV 727-743 ( 16 in all ), HK 407-438, KR 613-621, KN 331-346, VKK 204-231, SmK 531-545, VR 729-738, PC 357-366.</p>

<p><em>Satya-nārāyaṇavrata</em>-very popular in Bengal and Mahārāṣṭra: described in Bhaviṣya (Pratisargaparva) chap. 24–29; M. M. Hara Prasad Shastri in cat. of mss in the Asiatic Society&rsquo;s Library, Calcutta, vol. V. preface p. LXV says that the worship of Satyanārāyaṇa (ms. No. 3370 ) has a Mahomedan origin. It was originally (and even now in many places) called &lsquo;Satyapirer pūjā&rsquo;. It occurs in the Revākhaṇḍa of the Skandapurāṇa (Vangavāsi ed.) but does not occur in the Venk. Press edition. Vide also JBORS vol. XVI at p. 328 where the same scholar says that the Mahomedan custom of offering &lsquo;Sirṇi&rsquo; to Satyapir was adopted by Bengal Hindus as worship of Satyanārāyaṇa. This is a vrata very popular among lower middle-class people and women. Vide 1. A. vol. 3 pp. 83-85 for stories current in Bengal about this vrata. It is said that Nārada was told about this vrata by Viṣṇu himself. On any day a man worships Satyanārāyaṇa and offers naivedya of 1 1/4 quantity (such as 1 1/4 <em>śer or maund</em>) of plantains, ghee, milk and wheat flour (or rice flour), jaggery or sugar; all these to be mixed up for naivedya ; performer should listen to the stories and partake of the <em>prasāda</em>; jāgara with songs, music, dance; then people go to their houses; this yields all desired objects; stories about a brāhmaṇa who performed this vrata every month, of a vendor of wood, of a trader named Sādhu with a ship full of merchandise and costly things and his daughter Kalāvati. In these stories Satyanārāyaṇa is represented as very jealous and vindictive. The stories are said to have been taken from Skandapurāṇa, Revā-khaṇḍa.</p>
<p><em>Sadāvrata</em>-otherwise called &lsquo;annadānamāhātmya&rsquo;. HV II.469-475 quoting Bhav. U. wherein Kr̥ṣṇa narrates to Yudhiṣṭhira the importance of giving food to others and refers to the words of Rāma to Lakṣmana that they suffered exile in a forest because of not feeding brāhmaṇas, that king Śveta suffered pangs of hunger even when in heaven and was told by Brahmā that his plight was due to his not having fed hungry persons. The word literally means &lsquo;vrata (i.e. giving food ) always&rsquo;. In modern times it is often pronounced and written as &lsquo;Sadāvarta&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sadābarta&rsquo; or &lsquo;Sadāvarat&rsquo;; vide <em>Murarji v. Nenbai</em> I. L. R. 17. Bom. 351 for ā bequest of rents for establishing a &lsquo;sadāvarat&rsquo;. HV II.471 quotes a verse saying that &lsquo;food is the very life of beings, it is their vigour, strength and happiness and therefore the donor of food is declared to be the giver of every thing&rsquo;. The importance of giving food is stressed in the exordium &lsquo;atithidevo bhava&rsquo; in Tai. Up. I. 11. 2; vide also Atharva IX 6 ff and Kaṭhopaniṣad I, 1. 7.</p>

<p><em>Sandhyā</em> (twilight)-is the period of three <em>ghaṭikās</em> ( 72 minutes) before sunrise and after sunset and it was provided that one should not engage in four actions in that period, viz. eating, sexual intercourse, sleep, Vedic study; HK 694-97, PC 46; Utpala on Br̥haj-jātaka VII. 1 quotes Varāha that it is the time after half the sun&rsquo;s disc has gone down till appearance of stars and morning twilight is from the east having light till half the sun&rsquo;s disc appears.</p>
<p><em>Saptadvipavrata</em>-begin on Cai. śu. 1st and worship for seven days in order the seven <em>dvipas</em> (continents ), viz.

<p><em>Saptamīsnapana</em>-Mat. (68.1-42 ) describes this at length; HV (I. 763–768 ) quotes from Bhav. U. almost the same verses as those in Mat. It is said to be an antidote against disease, ill-luck or distress or the death of infants. It should be performed in the 7th month after a child is born to a woman who lost an infant child or on a 7th tithi in śu., but tithi of the birth should be avoided; offer to the Sun and Rudra and the Mātr̥s specially oblations of rice with milk, repeat hymn to the Sun (R̥g.

<p><em>Hayapañcami or Hayapūjāvrata</em>-on Cai. 5th Uccaiḥśravas ( Indra&rsquo;s horse ) rose from the ocean and so he should be worshipped along with gandharvas (such as Citraratha, Citrasena) who are its bandhus with songs, sweetmeats, <em>polikas</em> (Marathi, <em>poli</em>), curds, jaggery, milk, rice flour; reward-strength, long life, health non-defeat in battle; HV I. 573 ( quoting Śālihotra), SmK. 92.

U. 20. 1-28). The story is that Kāli was daughter of Dakṣa, was given in marriage to Mahādeva and was dark in complexion. Once in an assembly of gods Mahādeva called her as dark as collyrium. She was angered, left her complexion on a grassy plot and threw herself into fire. She was born again as Gauri and became Mahādeva&rsquo;s wife. The dark complexion laid aside by Kāli became Kātyāyani, who helped gods in their undertakings. The gods bestowed on her the boon that those men or women who would worship Kāli existing in green grass would have happiness, long life and <em>saubhāgya</em>. The printed HV labels it Harikāli, but no question about Hari (meaning Viṣṇu) arises here. Hari here probably simply means &rsquo;tawny&rsquo; (i.e. Kāli who was once brown or tawny and not fair ).</p>

<p><em>Harivāsara</em>-The day of Hari. There is a divergence of views on this point; VKK 14 holds that Ekādaśī is really the day of Hari and not dvādaśī. Gar. I. 127. 12 and Nāradapurāṇa II. 24. 6 and 9 call Ekādaśī Harivāsara; KSS 43 quotes Mat. to the effect that if Āṣ. śu. 12th falls on Wednesday and has Anurādhā nakṣatra and if Bh, śu. 12 falls on Wednesday and has Śravaṇa nakṣatra and if K. śu. 12 falls on Wednesday and has Revati nakṣatra, these are called Harivāsara. Smk 29 holds that Dvādaśī is Haritithi.</p>
