      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER VII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;ESCHATOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What happens after death to a human being (which is the subject matter of Eschatology) has been a great mystery that has intrigued and baffled mankind in all ages and was a question of vital importance among almost all ancient peoples such as the Indians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians. The word Eschatology is derived from a Greek term meaning &amp;rsquo;last things and is applied to the study of opinions that men have held from time to time concerning the future, including such matters as the state of man after life on this earth and the end of the world. It exercises a great fascination over most people and speculation on it can be carried on endlessly. Every religion has its own eschatology. There are two aspects of Eschatology; one is concerned with the destiny of the individual after death, immortality of the soul, sin and punishment, the meaning and content of &amp;lsquo;Heaven&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Hell&amp;rsquo;; the other aspect of eschatology has relation to the whole universe, its creation, destination and renovation, and the ultimate end of all things. The first aspect and matters relevant to it from the ancient Indian point of view will be dealt with in this section and the second aspect of Eschatology is reserved for treatment in a later section. In ancient works far more emphasis was laid on the first than on the second, while modern men with a more or less scientific outlook and attitude are inclined to think more of the second aspect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER VIII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;SUDDHI&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Śuddhi (purification ) is a very comprehensive topic including within it purification after āśauca (impurity on birth and death), purification of a person after contact with an impure object or on account of certain occurrences. purification of pots, wells, food &amp;amp;c., after they are polluted. Aśauca, however, is the most important subject under śuddhi and therefore the Śuddhi.kaumudi &amp;lsquo;defines &amp;lsquo;śuddhi&amp;rsquo; as &amp;rsquo;the state of being fit for or capable of performing the rites that are understood from the Veda&amp;rsquo;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The Smṛtis employ the word śuddhi in relation to purification after āśauca. For example, Manu V.57 starts by saying that he will expound purification after a man is dead ( pretaśuddhi) and purification of things (dravyaśuddhi). Manu V. 83 ( = Dakṣa VI. 7) avers that a brāhmaṇa becomes pure after ten days (on the death or birth of a relative), a kṣatriya after twelve &amp;amp;c. The Parāśara-smṛti starts chapter three by declaring &amp;lsquo;I shall expound śuddhi on birth and death.&amp;rsquo; Yaj. III. 14, 25 also employ the word śuddhi. Therefore aśauca on birth and death will be first dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
