SECTION IV CHAPTER XI

TIRTHAYĀTRĀ (pilgrimages to holy places )

All religions have laid great emphasis on the sacredness of certain localities and have either enjoined or recommended with great insistence pilgrimages to them. Among the five incumbent practical religious duties1237 of a Moslem, pilgrimage at least once in his life to Mecca and Medina, the birth place and burial place of the prophet Mohammad, is one. The four places of pilgrimage for Buddhists have been the place of the birth of Buddha (Lumbini or Rummindei), the place where he attained perfect enlightenment (Bodh Gayā), the place where he set in motion the wheel of dharma by delivering his first sermon (at Sārnāth near Benares ) and the place where he passed away into the state of nirvana (Kusinārā). Vide Mahāparinibbānasutta (S. B. E. vol. XI. p. 90). For Christians Jerusalem has been the holiest place and no religious com munity except the Christians undertook in historic times several great military pilgrimages. The crusades were launched to free the Holy Land of Christians from the domination of Moslems. In spite of what Gibbon says 1238 somewhat cynically about those who joined the crusades, it must be admitted that there were thousands among the crusaders who risked their lives and fortunes in the pursuit of an ideal. In India holy places have played a very important part. Large rivers, mountains and forests have always been venerated as sacred1239

1237. Vide S. B. E. vol. VI. Introduction LXXI, for the five duties. The pilgrimage is called Haj and the Moslem who performs it is entitled to be called Hāji.

1238. Gibbon remarks 'At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised against their christian brethren and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. VII (ed. of 1862 ) p. 188.

Advantages of pilgrimages

553 and as the abodes of gods. In ancient and medieval India pilgrimages brought many advantages to the community as well as to the pilgrims themselves. Though India was divided into many kingdoms and the people of India followed several cults and sub-cults, pilgrimages tended to foster the idea of the essential and fundamental unity of Indian culture and of India also, Benares and Rāmeśvara were held sacred by all Hindus, whether they hailed from the north of India or from the peninsula. Though the Hindu community was broken up into numerous castes and suffered from caste exclusiveness, pilgrim ages tended to level up all men by bringing them together to the same holy rivers or shrines. The traditions associated with holy places, the discipline through which the pilgrims passed, association with holy and philosophic men and the whole atmos phere and environment at tirthas made it easy for pilgrims to remain at a high spiritual level and inculcated in them a mood of reverence that lasted long even after they returned from the pilgrimage, Pilgrimages supplied the much needed stimulus to draw ordinary men away from selfish pursuits and to make them think of the higher and more enduring moral and spiritual values. These obvious benefits and the belief that a holy place was the abode of some divinity led ancient dharmaśāstra writers to lay emphasis on visits to tirthas. The Visṇu Dh. S. provides 1240 that the dharma common to all men comprises the following: forbearance, truthfulness, restraint of the mind, cleanliness, charity, control of the senses, ahimsā, obedience to elders, visiting holy places, compassion, straightforwardness,

(Continued from the last page) beauty so that her mind could come out of its world of narrow necessities and realize its place in the Infinite. This was the reason why in India a whole people who once were meat-eaters gave up taking animal food to cultivate the sentiment of universal sympathy for life, an event unique in the history of mankind.' There is a fundamental difference in the outlook of modern Westerners and that of ancient and medieval Indians (which persists to a large extent even now). If there is a beauty spot anywhere most men in the West would think of building a hotel there for tourists, while ancient and medieval Indians would have thought of erecting a shrine there.

freedom from avarice, honouring gods and brāhmanas and freedom from jealousy. Modern men whose faith in some of the aspects of the religious beliefs of our forefathers has been weakened or altogether sapped by the sight of the professional ministrants at the tirthas and their rapacity and ignorance

should not judge the ancient attitude towards tirthas harshly.

The word tirtha occurs frequently in the Rgveda and other Vedic samhitās. In several passages of the Rgveda tirtha appears to mean a road or a way (e. g. in Rg. I. 169.6 'tirthe nāryaḥ paumsyāni tasthuḥ', Rg. I. 173. 11 tirthe nācchā tātrsānam-oko', Rg. IV. 29. 3 'karan-na Indrah sutirthābhayam ca.' In gome places tirtha may be taken to mean a ford in a river, as in Rg. VIII. 47. 11' sutirtham-arvato yathānu no neṣathā sugam &c.', Rg. I. 46. 8 'aritram vām divas-prthu tirthe sindhūnām rathah'. In Rg. X. 31. 3 tirthe na dasmam upa yantyūmāḥ', tirtha probably means 'a holy place'. On Rg. VIII. 19. 37 'Suvāstvā adhi tugvani' the Nirukta IV. 15 explains that Suvāstu is a river and tugvan means 'tirtha' (either a ford or a holy spot). In the Tai. S. VI. 1. 1.1-2 1241 it is said that the sacrificer is to bathe at a tirtha (probably a holy river). The Rudras are said to prowl about tirthas (ye tirthāni pracaranto sľkāvanto niṣangiṇaḥ) in Tai. S. IV.5.11.1-2 and Vāj. S. 16. 61 (reads 'sýkāhasta'). In the Sānkhāyana Br. 1242 it is said that Day and Night are the sea that absorbs every thing and the twilights are the unfathomable tirthas (of the sea)'. Tirtha also means the way between the 'utkara' and 'cātvāla'pit for going to or coming from the sacrificial ground (the vihāra ).124?a Vide H. of Dh vol. II. p. 984.

It is said that, just as some parts of the human body (e. g. the right hand or ear) are held to be purer (than others), so some localities on the earth are held to be very holy. Tirthas are held to be holy (on three grounds, viz.) on account of some wonderful natural characteristic of the locality or on account of the peculiar strikingness (or grandeur) of some watery place or on account of the fact that some (holy ) sages resorted to

them (for bathing, austerities &c.). Tirtha, therefore, means a locality or spot or expanse of water which gives rise to the accumulation of righteousness (merit) owing to its own peculiar nature without any adventitious circumstance (such as the presence of Sālagrāma near it ).1243 Or it is better to say that those localities that have been technically spoken of by wise and great sages as tirthas are tirthas, just as Papini employs such technical terms as Nadi and Vrddhi in his grammar. The Skandapurana.1214 says that a spot of the earth resorted to by ancient good men for the collection of merit is called tirtha and that the main thing is to go to (i. e, associate with holy ) men and pilgrimage is only a secondary object.

In the Rgveda waters, rivers in general and certain named rivers 1245 are referred to with great reverence as holy and are deified. In Rg. VII. 49 the refrain of all four verses is 'may the divine waters protect me' (ta apo devir-iha mamavantu). In Rg. VII. 49.1 waters are spoken of as purifying ( punānāḥ). Rg. VII, 47, X. 9, X, 30 1246 are hymns addressed to waters as divinities. They are said to purify a man not only physically but are also invoked to rid a man of all sins and lapses from the right path. The Tai. S. II. 6.8.3 asserts that all deities are centred in waters (āpo vai sarvā devatah). In the Atharvaveda 1247 (I. 33.1) waters are described as holy and purifying and are invoked to confer happiness. About twenty rivers in all

X. 64. 8 speaks of rivers that are thrice seven and the next verse mentions the three great rivers, viz. Sarasvati, Sarayu and Sindhu, as divine and as mothers. Sāyana remarks that these three are the principal rivers of three groups of seven rivers each. Seven Sindhus are mentioned in many verses of the Rgveda (e. g. I. 32. 12, I. 34. 8, I. 35. 8, II. 12. 12, IV. 28. 1, VIII. 24. 27, X. 43. 3) and the Atharvaveda (VI. 2. 1 'apām napāt sindhavaḥ sapta pātana). The river Sarasvati has three hymns devoted to it as a deity in the Rg. (viz. VI, 61, VII, 95 and 96) and it is addressed in many detached verses also. Rg. VII. 95. 2 says that the pure Sarasvati, flowing from the mountains up to the sea, alone among rivers, knew the prayer of Nāhusa and granted it. A king and smaller people are said to dwell on the banks of the Sarasvati (Rg. VIII. 21. 18 ) 1249. The impetuous and roaring

1249. Vide Journal of the Department of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. XV. pp. 1-63, where an attempt is made to show that Sarasvati was really the Indus. But this is far from acceptable. Sarasvati, Sarayu and Sindhu are mentioned in Rg. X. 64. 9 as the chief rivers of three groups. Prof. Ksetreschandra Chattopadhyaya refers to the conflict of views among scho lars, admits (on p. 22) that, in the 10th Mandala of the Rgveda, Sarasvati - cannot be identified with the Indus, that in Rg. III. 23. 4 Sarasvati cannot be held to be the Indus and asserts that in Mandalas VI and VII of the Rg. Sarasvati is really the Indus, while in Mandala X it is not so. The whole argument is vitiated by several unwarranted assumptions. He takes the modern conditions of Sarsuti as existing in the early Vedic period. What reasons are there against holding that the Sarasvati was in very ancient times a mighty river like the modern Indus and that owing to volcanic eruptions or earthquake upheavals and convulsions in the dim past the Sarasvati lost its mighty character? Further how many centuries does he postulate as having intervened between the composition of the 6th and 7th Mandalas and Rg. III. 23. 4 and Rg X. 75.5? [1 for my part find no diffia culty in holding that in Rgvedic times there were two mighty rivers, the Sindhu (Indus) and the Sarasvati. I cannot enter into this question in greater detail here. Even in the Puranas the Sarasvati is described springing from a Plaksa tree, as flowing through Kuruksetra, as rendingas under thousands of hillocks and as entering the Dvaita forest.

flood of the Sarasvati impinging by its powerful waves against the tops of hills is referred to in Rg. VI. 61. 2 and 8 1250. In VII. 96. 1, Sarasvati is spoken of as asuryā (of divine origin) among rivers. Sacrifices are said to have been performed on the Drsadvati, the Apayā and Sarasvati (Rg. III. 23. 4). In Rg. II. 41, 16 Sarasvati is called the best of rivers and goddesses (ambitame naditame devitame Sarasvati). Rg. I. 3. 11-12 praise 1251 Sarasvati as a river and a deity, as a purifier (pāvaka), as the impeller of sweet but truthful words and the inspirer of good thoughts and as bringing to notice its great flood of waters. From Rg. VII. 95. 2, VII. 49.2 and I. 71. 7 it is obvious that the Rgvedic sages knew that the seven rivers fell into the sea. It would be proper to hold that the seven rivers are Sindhu (Indus), the five rivers of the Panjab and the Sarasvati. Though from the Rgveda passages cited above it appears that in the times of the hymns of the Rgveda Sara svati was a big river with abundant waters, that it flowed between the Yamunā and Sutudri (X, 75. 5), in the times of the Brāhmaṇas it disappeared in the sands. It is now gene rally identified with the modern Sarsuti which is lost in the desert at Bhatnair. 7 The Vāj. S. 34. 11 says that five rivers together with their tributary streams fall into Sarasvati, 1252 There were three sattras called Sārasvata, viz. the first in hon our of Mitra and Varuna, the 2nd for Indra and Agni and the third for Aryaman. The dikṣā (consecration ceremony) was to be performed on the south bank of the dry bed of the Saras vati where it disappeared underground 1253. Vide Tāṇdya Br.

25.10 for the first Sārasvata-sattra, 25. 11 for the 2nd and 25.12 for the third. The land between Vinasana and Plaksa Prāsra vana (which was the source of the Sarasvati) was the proper locality for Sārasvata sattra. At the confluence of Sarasvati and Drsadvati an isti to Apām Napāt was performed wherein boiled rice (caru) was the offering.) From the place where the Sarasvati disappeared up to Plaksa-Prāsravana the distance was a journey on horse-back for forty days and nights. When the sacrificers (in the sattra) reach Plaksa Prāsravana they should stop the performance of the items of the sattra and undergo the Avabhrtha bath near the river Yamunā (modern Jumna) which flows through the country called Kārapacava (and not in the Sarasvati even if it had water). For details, vide Kātyāyana Srautasūtra (10. 15-19) which mentions (in 10. 19.1) a spot called Parīṇaḥ in Kuruksetra where the Vedic fires were to be kindled, the Āśv. S. S. 12. 6. 1-28 which adds that at the distance of each throw of the Samyā from

the Vinaśana one day is to be spent by the sacrificers, 6, the Kātyāyana Srauta-sūtra (24. 5-6) which states that the

isti at the confluence of the Drṣadvati and Sarasvati is to be offered to Agni Kāma, Ap. S. S. 23. 12-13 (which gives more details than any one of the other three sutras ). In the Ait. Br, a story is narrated that the sages performed a sattra on the Sarasvati and Kavaṣa who was sitting amongst them was driven out by them as not a brāhmana but the son of a female slave and left in a sandy desert with the idea that he

would die of thirst; but he praised the waters or Apām napāt ✓ with the hymn, Rg. X. 30 ('pra devatrā brahmane') called

Vāvupurāṇa' (p. 334) remarks that the institution of pilgrimage was first ✓ started by Buddhists and Jains and that later on it became common to all

faiths in India. This is quite wrong. The Brāhmana and Srautasūtra pass ages clearly show that there were holy places in the comparatively small part of India up to the Yamuna where the Sarasvata sattras had to be carried on STATUS The importance of holy places, visiting them and performing religious til there were known in the Brahmana period at least a thousand years before Buddhism and Jainism began to spread.

forward came to be called 1254 'Parisaraka'. This shows that ( in the times of the Ait. Br. and long before it the bed of the

Sarasvati was dry. Devala 1255 mentions several places as Sarasvata tirthas. The Rgveda 1256 VIII, 6.28 appears to hold that the valleys of mountains and the confluences of rivers are sacred. Mountains have been held by most ancient peoples to be the abodes of gods. Mount Parnassus north of Delphi was one of the most holy mountains in classical Greece and Olympus was supposed to be the home of the gods. In the Rgveda Parvata is a dual deity with Indra. 'O, Indra and Parvata! may you two sharpen (or purify) us (our intellects)' Rg. I. 122.3 1257; 0, Indra and Parvata! May you two, being in the forefront of battle, kill with the thunderbolt every one who desires to attack us with an army' Rg. I. 132.6. In Rg. VI. 49. 14 a prayer is addressed to Parvata separately 'May the god Ahirbudhnya, may Parvata and may Savitr bestow on us food together with the waters on account of our prayers'. In Rg. III. 33.1 the two great rivers Vipās (modern Beas) and Sutudri are described as issuing from the lap of mountains. Here the word 'Parvata' is used in its ordinary sense. The Atharvaveda 1258 speaks of a salve (āñjana) from Traikakuda peaks of the Himālaya mountain "May that salve which comes off the Himalaya from Traikakuda (peaks) destroy all wizards and all witches'. The Hir. Gr. I. 3.11.5 (S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 168) also

It may be noted that the Vanaparva chap 83 when enumerating the numerous tirthas on the Sarasvati and in 5 mentions a famous tirtha called Saraka which is said to contain in it the sanctity of three crores of tirthas (verses 75-76).

refers to this salve. Gaut., Baud. Dh. S. and Vas. Dh. S. have the same sutra 1259 stating that the detas (localities) that are holy and hence destroyers of sin are all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (rsis), cowpens and temples of the gods. The Vayupurana 1260 and Kūrma state that all parts of the Himālaya are holy, the Ganges is holy everywhere, all rivers falling into the sea and all seas are holy. The Padmapurāṇa (Bhūmikhanda 39. 46-47) says that all rivers, whether flowing through a village or a forest, are holy and that where no name of a tirtha on rivers is known it should be called Visputīrtha. Kālidāsa speaks of the Himālaya as devatātmā (as vivified by the presence of gods) in the Kumārasambhava (I. 1). The Bhagavata V. 19.16 names 27 holy mountains while the Brahmānda (II. 16. 20-23) names thirty. The grandeur and sublimity of snow-capped mountains, of large life-sustaining rivers and of great forests easily in press the minds of almost all people and induce them to think that there is something divine about them, that the Supreme

Effect of holy places on the mind

561

Being is partially revealed in such surroundings. In Protestant Europe and the U, S. A. hardly anyone performs a pilgrimage to a holy place in these days. Instead, they tour different countries for rest, health and in search of natural beauty and a respite from humdrum existence. But pilgrimage to a place supposed to be holy for the curing of disease is not rare even now. When one reads a work like that of Louis Carell, a great surgeon and a winner of the Nobel prize, on the miracles worked at Lourdes in France (in 'a Journey to Lourdes') one sees that pilgrimage has taken on a new motive in the West. Similarly, pilgrimage to the tombs of unknown warriors has become common owing to the two world wars.

In Rg. X. 146 a large forest 1261 (Aranyāni) is invoked as a deity. The Vāmanapurāṇa mentions 1252 seven forests in Kuruksetra as holy and as removers of sin, viz. Kāmyaka, Aditivana, Vyāsavana, Phalakivana, Sūryavana, Madhuvana and Punyasitavana...

In the Sūtras and ancient smrtis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya tirthas do not occupy a very prominent positions But in the Mahābhārata and the Puranas they are highly lauded and placed even above sacrifices. In the Vanaparva 1263 a com parison is made between sacrifices to gods and pilgrimages, Sacrifices require numerous implements, collection of materials, the co-operation of priests and the presence of a wife and so

they can be performed only by princes or rich men. They can not be performed by poor men, who are devoid of wealth, who are without a wife and without friends, who are helpless. The reward that a man gets by visiting holy places cannot be secured by performing such sacrifices as Agnistoma in which large fees are paid (to priests); therefore visiting holy places is superior to sacrifices. But the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 82. 9-12 and Anusāsana 108. 3-4) lays the greatest emphasis on the cultivation of high moral and spiritual qualities if the full reward of pilgrimages is to be reaped. It says 1264 'He whose hands, feet and mind are well controlled and who possesses know ledge, austerities and a good reputation derives the (full) reward

of pilgrimages. He who turns his face away from receiving gifts vand is content with what little he gets and is free from vanity

obtains the rewards of pilgrimages. He, who is free from hypoco risy (or deceit), is not engaged in various undertakings (for earning money), is not a heavy eater, has subdued his senses and is (therefore) free from all sins; so also he who does not fly into a rage, who always speaks the truth, who is firm in his observances, and acts towards all beings by treating them like himself, obtains the full reward of pilgrimages'. The idea seems to be that pilgrimages may help to remove the sins of men who are not possessed of the above characteristics, while those who possess these acquire a great store of merit in addition. The Skanda (Kāśikhanda 6.3) asserts 'snāna cannot be predicated of a man whose body alone is flooded with water; that man who is plunged in restraint of senses, who is pure, relieved of all taint and is stainless, is alone to be called snāta' (as having had a bath). The Anuśāsana has almost the same

words (108.9). 1261a The Vāyupurāṇa states 1265 "A steadfast (or wise ) man visiting tirthas with faith and controlling his senses would be purified even if he has been guilty of sins; what need is there to say about him whose actions have been pure? One who has no faith, who is full of sins, whose mind is not free from doubts (about the rewards of pilgrimages and the rites there ), who is an atheist and who is bent on bad reasoning-these five do not reap the rewards of pilgrimages '. The Skandapurāṇa (I. 1. 31. 37) remarks that all holy places, sacrifices and various gifts are meant for cleansing the mind (of its sins and sinful proclivities, manaḥ-śuddhi). The Padmapurāṇa (IV. 80.9) remarks: sacrifices, vratas, tapas and dāna cannot be carried out fully in the Kali age; but bathing in the Ganges and taking the name of Hari are free from all defects. The Vispudharmottarapurāṇa1266 puts the matter very clearly when it says 'When resort is made to a tirtha, it removes the sins of the sinful and tends to the increase of merit in the case of the good and that a holy place yields fruit to men of all varnas and aśramas.' Some of the Purānas (such as Skandapurāṇa, Kāśikhanda 6, Padma, Uttarakhanda, 237) say that in addition to the holy places on land (bhauma ) there are certain virtues that may be called mental tirthas (in a figurative sense ). According to them "truthfulness, forbear ance, restraint of the senses, compassion for all beings, straight-forwardness, charity, self-control, contentment, celibacy (brahmacarya), sweet speech, knowledge, patience, austerity, are tirthas and the highest tirtha is purity of mind.' They further state that a man who is avaricious, wicked, cruel, hypocritical and immersed in pleasures of senses is still sinful and impure even if he bathes in all tirthas and that fish are born and die in holy waters but they do not go to heaven because their minds are not purified and that even charity, sacrifices, austerity,

cleanliness, frequenting sacred places, learning-all these are not tirthas, if the mind is not pure. 1267 The Brahmapurāṇa ( 25.4-6 ) states 'a heart that is wicked is not purified by baths at holy places, just as a vessel in which surā (liquor ) was carried remains impure even after being washed with water hundreds of times, that tirthas, gifts, vratas, or (residence in ) hermitages do not purify a man whose heart is wicked, who resorts to hypocrisy and whose senses run away (are uncontrolled). Wherever a man who has his senses under control may dwell, there are present Kuruksetra, Prayaga and Puskara'. The Vāmanapurāṇa has a fine1267a Rūpaka about the soul being a river full of the water of control, flowing with truth and having character as the bank and the waves of compassion (for all beings) and states that the soul cannot be purified by water. The Padmapurana (II,39.56-61) extends the meaning and scope of tirthas by remarking that places where Agnihotra and sraddha are performed, a temple, a house where Veda is being studied, a cowpen, the place where a soma drinker dwells, parks, a place where the Asvattha exists, a. place where Purāna is being recited or where one's teacher

stands or where a chaste housewife dwells, or where a father v and a worthy son dwell are all holy.

Numberless tirthas and holy shrines have been mentioned from ancient times. The Matsyapurana states 1268 that Vayu declared that there are 35 millions of tirthas in the sky, in the ærial regions and on the earth and all of them are centred in the Ganges; while the Vamanapurana 46.53 states that there are 35_millions of Lingas. The Brahmapurana says that the number of tirthas and shrines is so large that they cannot be

enumerated in detail even in hundreds of years. The Vanaparva 1269 remarks that Naimisa is the best ) tirtha on the earth and Puṣkara in the ærial region, while Kuruksetra is the most distinguished in all the three worlds and that all the ten thousand crores of tirthas are present in Puskara (chap. 82.21). New tirthas were added from time to time and the monetary benefits derived by the permanent residents and particularly by the tirtha priests led them to prepare numerous māhātmyas of an apocryphal character and father them on Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata and the Purāpas. Most of the writers of digests on tirthas follow a process of selection. The Tirthakalpataru of Laksmīdhara, one of the earliest digests (about 1110-1120 AD), devotes more than half the work to Vārāṇasi and Prayāga alone, assigns only two or three pages to such famous tirthas as Puskara, Prthūdaka, Kokāmukha, Badarikāśrama, Kedāra. The Nrsimhaprasāda (Tirthasāra) mostly deals with tirthas in the Deccan and southern India such as Setubandha, Pundarika (modern Pandharpur), Godavari, Krsnā-venyā, Narmadā. The Tri sthalisetu of Nārāyaṇabhatta devotes two-thirds of it to Benares and its sub-tirthas and the rest to Prayāga and Gayā. This unequal treatment arose from various causes, such as the locali ties where the authors lived, their familiarity with the holy places and their predilections. There was also another tendency among the authors of Purānas, Māhātmyas and digests viz. that of great exaggeration and over-statement which is often repellent. If a man reads the description of one tirtha and does not discount much as sheer hollow laudation, he is likely to feel that a pilgrimage to a certain tirtha will yield all the desires in this life as well in the next and that after Visiting a holy tirtha like Kāśi or Prayāga he need not go to any other tirtha, nor need he perform any yajña or act of charity and the like. A few striking passages may be cited here. The Vanaparva remarks that 1270 even gods and sages secured

perfection at Puskara and that whoever takes a bath there and devoutly worships gods and his pitrs secures rewards ten times of what the performance of Aśvamedha might give. About this very tirtha viz. Puskara, the Padmapurāṇa says that there is no holier tīrtha in this world. The Vanaparva (83. 145) in its eulogy of Prthūdaka asserts that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is holier than Kuruksetra and that Pșthūdaka is holier than all other tirthas. The Matsyapurāṇa puts the 1271 comparative holiness of several tirthas thus 'the waters of the Sarasvati purify after (one bathes for) three days, those of Yamunā in seven days, those of the Ganges at once, while the water of the Narmadā purifies a man at sight of it.' In its eulogy of Vārāṇasī the Kūrm a-purana states 'there is no place higher than Vārānasi nor will there be one' (I. 31. 64). The 'inveterate habit of exaggeration goes so far that it is said that by merely residing in Kāśi till one's death not only does a man become free from the great sin of brāhmana murder but from the never-ending cycle of births and deaths and is not born again.1272 The Lingapurāṇa says the same thing. The Vāmana purāṇa remarks 1273 that mukti (release from samsāra) can be secured in four ways, viz. by knowledge of Brahman, by śrāddha at Gayā, by loss of life in repelling the carrying away of cows and by residence in Kuruksetra and that those who die in Kuruksetra never come down (to the earth). Mere residence in Kāśi was so much lauded that the Matsya (181. 23), the Agni (112. 3) and other Purāṇas say that after repairing to Kāśi one should smash one's feet with a stone (in order that

one may not be induced to visit another tirtha) 1274 and stay in Kasi forever.

The Brahmapurana classifies tirthas into four divisions 1275 viz.daiva (created by gods), asura (those associated with such asuras as Gaya), arsa (those established by sages ) such as Prabhāsa, Naranārāyaṇa and mānusa (created by kings like Ambarisa, Manu, Kuru) and provides that each preceding one is superior to each succeeding one. It enumerates six rivers to the south of the Vindhya and six rivers having their sources in the Himālayas as most holy and as devatirthas, viz. Godavari, Bhimarathi, Tungabhadra, Venika, Tapi, PayosnI, BhagTrathi, Narmada, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Visoka, and Vitasta.. Similarly, Kāsi, Puskara and Prabhāsa are devatirthas (Tirthapr. p. 18). The Brahmapurāṇa (175. 31-32) assigns daiva, asura, arsa and manusa tirthas respectively to the Krta, Treta, Dvāpara and Kali yugas.'

4 There is a good deal of discussion in the Purāṇas and digests about those who are entitled or have the eligibility or capacity (adhikara) for tirthayātrā. The Vanaparva 1276 provides that brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, when they have bathed in holy places, are not born again. The same work further states that whatever sin a man or a woman may have committed from birth, the moment a person takes a bath in the holy Puskara all that sin vanishes. 1277 Therefore not only men but women also had the right to undertake tirthayātrā. The Matsyapurana 1278 goes further and asserts that 'Avimukta

(Vārāṇasi ) is the highest cure for men of numerous castes, for men not (recognized as ) belonging to any particular varna, for cāndālas who are abhorred (by people ) and for persons whose bodies are full of diseases and of aggravated sins.' It is stated in the Vāmanapurāṇa: 1279 persons of all the four āśramas, (i. e. brahmacārins, householders, forest hermits and sannya sins ) by bathing in the tirtha (mentioned by it ) save seven generations in their families and that persons belonging to the four varnas and women, when they bathe in tirthas with devotion, see the highest goal. It was provided by the Brahmapurāṇa that a brahmacārin can undertake a pilgrimage only if ordered or directed by his guru, and that a householder whose wife is alive and is chaste must go on a pilgrimage with her; otherwise he would not reap the fruit of pilgrimage. The Padmapurāṇa (Bhumikhanda chap. 59-60 ) narrates the story of a vaiśya called Kļkala who went on a pilgrimage with out his virtuous wife and did not reap the fruits of a long pilgrimage (bhāryām vinã yo dharmah sa eva viphalo bhavet, 59. 33).

śūdras.' This was explained away by stating that this text refers to undertaking pilgrimage without the husband's permis sion (in the case of a woman) and as to a sūdra in such a way as to be opposed to the primary duty of a śūdra to wait upon learned brāhmaṇas (as laid down in Manu X. 123). Kātyā yana1282 as quoted in the Vyavahāramayukha provides 'whatever a woman does that relates to (benefit in) a future state (i.e. state after death) without the permission of her (husband's) father, husband or son, would become fruitless.' It is clear therefore that it was recognized early that tirthayātrā was a popular way - for redemption of sins in the case of all classes of men and women. Though a Hindu woman succeeding as heir to her husband's estate has only a limited and qualified ownership over it, judicial decisions have recognized that she can alienate a small portion of her husband's estate for the expenses of a pilgrimage to Gayā for performing her husband's śrāddha for the latter's spiritual benefit or of a pilgrimage to Pandharpur. Vide Muteeram v. Gopal 11 Beng. L. R. 416; Darbari Lal v. Gobind 46 All. 822; Ganpat v. Tulsiram 36 Bom, 88 (pilgrimage to Pandharpur).1283 It was also provided that there was no question of untouchability 1284 when bathing in holy waters.

1283. Strangely enough, the Calcutta High court has held that a widow cannot validly alienate a part of her husband's property inberited by her as heir for a pilgrimage to Benares; vide Hari v.

But a gift to the temple of Jagannātha at Puri for bhog (offerings of cooked food) to the deity and for the maintenance of the priests there for the salvation of the husband and the members of his family and for the widow's own salvation was upheld by the Privy Council in Sardar Singh v. Kunj Behari 49 I. A. 383. As seen in note 1294 below, a person on returning from a pilgrimage had to honour and feed brāhmanas. In Dinanath v. Hrishikesh 18 C. W. N. 1303, 1306, where a widow on returning from a pilgrimage to Gayā for the benefit of her husband's soul incurred a debt for feeding brāhmanas and her husband's relatives and alienated a portion of her husband's property, it was held that the debt was one for a spiritual purpose and was binding on the reversioners after the death of the widow.

There is a verse of Bphaspati: 'At holy places, in marriages, in a religious festival (or procession), in a battle, when there is an invasion of the country and when a town or village is on fire, no blame attaches on the ground of incurring contact with untouchable persons or things.'s birt

In order to guard against the facile assumption that without a change of heart or change in one's sinful mode of life a mere physical act of pilgrimage and bath in holy waters would be enough, some of the texts in the Mahābhārata and Purānas adopted two propositions: viz. the one noted above that it is the pure mind that is a real tirtha and further emphasized that it is better to stay at home and perform all the duties of a householder including the perform ance of vedic sacrifices than to go on a pilgrimage. The Sānti parva 1285 in the dialogue between Tuladhāra and Jājali (a brahmana proud of his tapas) asserts that purodāsa is the holiest of offerings, that all rivers are (holy like ) Sarasvati and all hillocks (and not merely Himālaya and the like ) are holy, that one's soul is a tīrtha and advises Jājali not to be a guest (i. e, to be wandering in quest of tirthas ) to several countries. The Tirthacintāmaṇi and Tirthaprakāśa quote passages from the Brahmapurāṇa that a brāhmaṇa should wander about tirthas after his capacity to perform sacrifices has come to an end, that it is better for a man to stay at home and perform the duties of an householder when he has the capacity and authority to perform iṣtis and yajñas, and that all the tirthas do not come up (in their rewards ) to the performance of agnihotra. 1286 The Kurmapurana 1287 has the following remark able verses on this point. That person who abandoning his proper duties1287 resorts to tirthas does not reap the fruits of

pilgrimage in this world as well as in the next. A person who has to undergo an expiation (for a sin), or who is a widower or who is a householder of the yāyāvara 1288 type or similar persons may resort to pilgrimages. One may go to holy places with his vedic fires or with his wife; he becomes free from all sins and secures the best goal as stated above. One who wants to go on pilgrimages should pay off the three debts, should provide means of maintenance for his sons and should consign his wife to their care.'

Ancient writers on Dharmaśāstra favoured pilgrimages by prescribing, as stated in the Visnu Dh, S., that 1289 no money was to be demanded from a Vedic student, a forest hermit, an ascetic, a pregnant woman and a pilgrim by a ferryman or by a toll officer and that if he took money from such persons he was to be made to return it. But this prescription was not invariably followed even by Hindu Kings. The Rājatarangiṇi (VI. 254-255 and VII. 1008) notices that a tax was levied on Kashmirians performing śrāddhas at Gayā.1296 It appears that Siddharāja king of Anahilavād (1095-1143 A. D.) levied a tax on

Igrims going to Somanātha at the frontier town Bahuloda. that he remitted the tax at the intercession of his mother and that the tax thus remitted amounted to 72 lakhs of rupees every year (this last may be an exaggeration to glorify Siddharāja).1290 a Moslem kings levied this tax. It appears that a great writer called Kavindrācārya took up the cause of Hindu pilgrims visiting Prayāga and Kāśi and so eloquently pleaded it before Emperor Shah Jehan that the latter remitted the tax altogether

and conferred upon the great scholar 1291 the title of 'Sarva vidyā-nidhāna'. People throughout India felt such relief at the remission of the tax that congratulatory letters and addresses (several of them couched in very poetic language) poured upon Kavindrācārya. These have been published in a work styled ‘Kavindra-candrodaya' by Dr. Har Dutta Sharma and Mr. M. M. Patkar (in the Poona Oriental series), a characteristic verse from which is quoted below.1292 In a remarkable copper plate Inscription in Sanskrit 1293 and Kannada issued by the Hoysala king Narasimha III in Māgha sake 1200 (1279 A, D.) it is said that the king granted the revenues (amounting to 645 niṣkas a year) of a village called Hebbāle to the pilgrims of Kāśī and to god Sriviśveśvara for the purpose of enabling the pilgrims to Benares (including those from the whole of Karṇāțaka, from the countries of Telingaṇa, Tulu, Tirhut, Gauda and others) to pay off the tax levied by the Turuṣkas (Moslem kings ).1293

The digests quote certain verses of the Brahmapurāṇa about the rites to be performed when a person decides to start on a pilgrimage. The Brahmapurāṇa provides that the intend ing pilgrim should restrain his senses the previous day, should observe a fast and on the next day he should offer wor ship to Ganesa, the gods, the pitřs and honour good brāhmaṇas according to his ability and when he returns from the pilgrimage he should offer similar worship and honour.1294 The digests

explain that on return there is no fast and no worship of Ganesa. He should perform śrāddha in which there is plenty of ghee, honour three brāhmaṇas (at least) with the offer of sandalwood paste &c. and then make a resolve (sankalpa) to go on pilgrim age. The Vayupurana 1295 and the digests lay down that (after the worship of Ganesa, the planets and the deities) he should put on the dress of a kārpati viz, wear a copper-ring, a copper bracelet and reddish garments. Bhattoji (p.5) states that according to some the apparel of kārpaţika is to be put on by a pilgrim going to Gayā. The Padma (IV. 19. 22) prescribes the pilgrim's dress for other tirthas also. The Tir. C. adds that this dress is to be worn only on the journey to a tirtha, when the pilgrim is in a tirtha, but not at the time of performing his daily duties such as taking meals (p. 9).

There is a difference of opinion among the digests as to whether tonsure of the head is obligatory when starting on a pilgrimage. The Padmapurana 1296 and Skandapurana appear to make it obligatory. The Tirtha-Kalpataru does not 1297 refer to tonsure at all, while a fast at a tirtha is declared by it to be optional. The tendency of later digest-writers is generally to make every religious act more elaborate and harder. The tonsure of the head and beard was prescribed for a sacrificer

when undertaking such solemn Vedic sacrifices as Catur māsyas and Agnistoma 1298 The termination of the stage of Vedic studenthood (samavartana) was also marked by tonsure.1299 Further, tonsure was prescribed when undergoing prāyaścitta for sins (vide p. 122 above). The Tir. C. and Tir. Pr. both quote a verse of Visnu 1300 from the Smrtisamuccaya, viz, 'at Prayaga, on a pilgrimage, on the death of one's father or mother one should cut one's hair; but one should not cut one's hair without cause.'

Some read 'satsu' and therefore they take the first two words as

meaning on the Ganges only at Prayaga.' Both Tir. C.and Tir. Pr. quote a verse 1301 which says that tonsure and fast are acts that must be done at all tirthas except at Kuruksetra, Viśālā (Ujjayini or Badarikā), Virajā (river in Orissa) and Gayā.'

Tonsure for women at tirthas

575

in the case of women whose husbands are living only two finger breadths of hair are cut. Vrddha-Hārīta (IX. 386–387) lays down that in the case of women whose husbands are living tonsure of the head should not be carried out, but that holding up all their hair only three finger-breadths should be cut off, Other smrtis like Āpastamba in verse (I. 33-34), Angiras verse 163, Yama 54-55, Parāśara q. by the Mitāksarā on Yāj. III. 263-264. lay down that tonsure is limited to the cutting of two finger-breadths of hair in the case of woman (nārī). Par. M. 1302 II. 1. p. 291 reads 'evam nārīkumārīnām' and holds that nāri means here a woman whose husband is alive'. Although the smrti passages occur in the section on prāyaścitta still by analogy they are to be applied to the tonsure in holy places. As regards widows, ascetics 1303 and sūdras all hair are to be cut. The Tirthaprakāśa finds fault with Vācaspatimiśra for saying that there is no tonsure on the Ganges. When there is such a conflict of views, the final decision rests with the usage of each country or the individual's choice. The Tir. K. (p. 10) appears to hold that honouring the pitrs at the time of starting on a pilgrimage is specially obligatory on a man with means. The texts make a difference between kṣaura and mundana. The latter means 'shaving the hair on the head as well as the moust ache and beard,' while ksaura means only shaving the head. Therefore the Nāradiya says that all sages did not prohibit kṣaura even at Gayā but only mundana is forbidden there 1303c and there is no mundana on the Ganges anywhere except at Prayāga. The Tirthendusekhara (p. 7) gives it as its opinion that tonsure and fast are not obligatory but are only kāmya (i. e. to be done if certain rewards are desired) and points out that śistas do not resort to these two at many tirthas.

[Vol.

The Purāṇas and digests devote some attention to the mode of travel. The Matsya (106. 4-6) states that 1304 if a pilgrim goes to Prayāga in a conveyance drawn by bulls he falls into hell and his pitrs do not accept the water offered by him at the holy place and if a pilgrim because of riches or avarice or foolishness goes in a conveyance (not drawn by bulls) all his effort (as a pilgrim) becomes fruitless and therefore a pilgrim should avoid journey in a conveyance. According to the Kalpataru (on Tirtha p. 11) using a conveyance is forbidden only in the case of pilgrimage to Prayāga (and not in the case of other tirthas), while the Tir. C. (p. 8) and Tir. Pr. (p. 45) quote a verse 1305 which provides that if a pilgrim uses a cart drawn by bulls he is guilty of govadha (killing a cow), if he travels on horse-back (or in a horse-drawn carriage) his pilgrimage yields no fruit, if he is carried by men (in a palan quin or the like) he secures only half the merit but if he travels bare-footed then he wins the full merit. The Padma-purana. (IV. 19. 27) has a similar verse. The Tir. Pr. p. 34 quotes a verse from the Kūrmapurāṇa that those who are unable to perform a pilgrimage otherwise do not incur blame (or loss) by making use of a conveyance drawn by men or a chariot which is drawn by mules or horses. Similarly, a verse of the Visnupurana 1306 quoted by both Tir. C. and Tir. Pr. (pp. 34-35) provides that one should always go on a journey wearing shoes and holding an umbrella in the rains or in summer and armed with a staff at night or in a forest. The Viṣnudharmottara takes a more practical view when it says that to make a pil

grimage on foot is the highest tapas (austerity) and that if a pilgrimage be made in a conveyance the pilgrim will reap only the reward of the bath. The Tir. Pr. (p. 35) allows the use of a vessel to reach holy places like Gangāsāgara which cannot be reached otherwise.no

The Tristhali-setu (pp. 1-3) has a long discussion about the sankai pa 1307 (declaration) to be made at the time of start ing on a pilgrimage. The conclusions reached are that the declaration should not include the names of all the holy places intended to be visited, but should expressly state the last one up to which one desires to go, that persons from southern or western India should make a sankalpa about Gayā (and pilgri mage to Prayāga and Kasi will be implied) and that a person from East India should make a sankalpa about Prayaga (and pilgrimage to Gayā and Kāśi will be included as a matter of course) and that (as an alternative method) a man from south or west India should at first make a sankalpa about pilgrimage to Prayāga, then while in Prayāga he should make a sankalpa about visiting Kasi and then in Kāśi he should make a sankalpa about visiting Gayā. A pilgrim from Eastern India should first make a sankalpa about Gayā, then, while in Gayā, he should make one about Kāśi and so on. The Tirthaprakāśa (p. 326) appears to criticize the first method proposed by the Tristhalisetu and states its own view to be that those who intend to visit many sacred places should make a sankalpa in the form 'I shall perform pilgrimage' (Tirtha-yātrāmaham karisye). The Tirthaprakāśa, however, approves of the second method proposed as an alternative,

That the merit of a pilgrimage could be collected in a vicarious manner is laid down by the Smrtis and Purānas. Atri (50-51) provides 1308 'He for whom an effigy made with kusa grass intending it as a representative is dipped in the waters of a holy place secures one-eighth part of the merit' (that he would have secured by himself bathing in the waters).

of his mother, father, brother, friend or guru, these latter receive one-twelfth of the fruit of the pilgrimage). Another verse of Paithinasi says that he who visits a holy place for money (wages) from another gets only a 16th part of the merit, but he who goes to a tīrtha while bent on another purpose or errand (such as study, business, waiting on a guru) 1309 reaps only half the merit. The Visnudharmottara has a similar verse. It was owing to this idea of collecting merit and God's Grace that wealthy men built Dharmaśālās, tanks, and annasattras and wells for the conveniences of pilgrims and the planting of trees by the sides of roads had in view the comfort of pilgrims as well as of the general public. The Prabhāsa-khanda remarks 'A wealthy man who enables another to perform pilgrimage by providing his own money or conveyances gets one-fourth of the merit of the pilgrimage.' 1310

The Prāyaścittatattva of Raghunandana quotes from the Brahmāndapurāṇa some verses which enumerate fourteen acts that a pilgrim has to give up after reaching the Ganges viz. sauca (punctilious performance of bodily purification), ācamana (sipping water on various occasions in the day), hair (dress ing), wearing nirmālya (flowers taken away after being offered in worship), repeating the Aghamarṣaṇa hymn (Rg. 190. 1-3), shampooing the body, sports, acceptance of gifts, sexual dalliance, devotion to another tirtha, praising another tirtha, the gift to others of clothes (worn by oneself), striking any one and swimming across the water of the tirtha.

One noticeable rule is that, though Manu III, 149 requires strict examination of the ancestry and learning of brāhmanas to be invited at a śrāddha, some of the Puranas provide 1311 that

Tirtha brāhmaṇas to be preferred

one should not enter upon an examination of the worth of brāhmaṇas at holy places and this view is endorsed by seve ral digests such as the Kalpataru on tirtha (p. 10), the Tir. C. (p. 10) and the Tir. Pr. (p. 73). The last work remarks that brāhmanas who are known for certain to possess defects deser ving condemnation should be avoided. The Varāhapurāṇa goes1312 so far as to say that at Mathurā a pilgrim should prefer to honour a brāhmana born and bred up in Mathurā rather than a brāhmana who has studied the four Vedas (but is a stranger to Mathurā). Similar passages from the Vāyu and Skanda purāṇa have been quoted above in note 910 and there is another similar passage in Skanda, It is provided by the Vāyupurāṇa1313 that when a son goes to Gayā, he should invite only those brāhmanas that have been settled in Gayā by Brahmā and that such brāhmanas are above ordinary mortals, that when they are gratified the gods together with one's pitrs become pleased, that one should not enter upon a consideration of their family, their character, their learning or their austerities and that when the Gayā brāhmanas are honoured the man doing so secu res release (from samsāra). In Vāyu 106. 73-84 and Agni 114. 33-39 and Garuda it is narrated that, after Gayasura fell down and asked for boons which were granted by Visnu, Brahmā bestowed upon the Gayā brāhmaṇas 55 villages and Gayātirtha extending over five krośas, gave them well-appointed houses, desire-yielding cows and trees, but he enjoined on them not to beg or accept a gift from others. The brāhmaṇas, however, greedy as they were, officiated at a sacrifice performed by Dharma (Yama) and begged him for fees and accepted them. Then Brahmā cursed them that they would always be in debt and took away the Kāmadhenu and Kalpavrksa and other gifts. The Agnipurāṇa 1314 (114. 37) adds that Brahmā cursed them to be bereft of all learning and to be full of greed. The brāhmanas then begged Brahmā to favour them with some means of liveli hood (as they had been deprived by the curse of Brahmā of all that had been bestowed on them). Brahmā pitied them and told them that they would maintain themselves at Gayā-tirtha

till the end of the world and that those who would perform Śrāddha at Gayā and worship them (by engaging them as officiating priests and pay them) would secure the merit of having worshipped Brahmā. From this it is clear that the Gayā brāhmaṇas at the time of the composition of the section on Gayā at the end of the Vayupurāṇa possessed the same characteristics as the modern Gayā brāhmaṇas (Gayāls or Gayāwals as they are called) and made the Gayā pilgrimage their business even then (as now). One of the early historic references to Gayāl brāhmaṇas occurs in the Saktipur copper plate of king Laksmanasena of Bengal in his 6th year (i. e. about 1183 A. D.)1315.

The result of this teaching of the Purāṇas was that the brāhmaṇas at Gayā became a guild or a close corporation and the Gayāwals resent the intrusion of an outsider. Disputes between Gayāwals and outside priests and cases of Gayāwals have come before the courts and have gone up even to the Privy Council in England. It has been a usage for orthodox Hindu pilgrims going to Gayā to shave themselves at the river called Punpun, 1315a then on arrival at Gayā to worship the feet of one of the Gayāwal brālmaṇas. The Gayāwal himself or his agent takes the pilgrim to the sacred spots (Vedīs) in and around Gayā. The priest is paid a fat fee near the Akṣaya-vata and the Gayāwal puts a garland of flowers on the folded hands of the pilgrim and pronounces the word 'suphala' and utters a blessing that the pilgrim's ancestors would go to heaven on account of the pilgrim's visit to Gayā. In order to keep this business in their own families the Gayāwals have adopted loose and peculiar customs. If a Gayāwal is sonless he makes a gift of his office (called gadi or gaddi) to another Gayāwal, who describes himself as the adopted son of the Gayāwal making the gift. There is no real adoption in the strict sense. Therefore, the so called adopted son retains his rights in the family of birth, he is not severed from his natural family and it is not rare to find that one Gavāwal claims to have succeeded to four gādis (i. e. claims to be the son adopted by several persons simultaneously). The Gayāwals have got books in which they enter the names and addresses of

their clients, who sign such entries and enjoin upon their des cendants to make members of that particular Gayawal family their gurus whenever they might visit Gayā. Thus large incomes and properties come to the hands of the Gayāwals. They send their agents throughout India, who bring as many pilgrims as possible. In Lachman Lal v. Kanhaya Lal the Privy 1316 Council had to deal with the case of a Gayāwal who claimed to be an adopted son without loss of his interest in the property of the natural family on the ground of these peculiar practices of the Gayāwals and that claim was upheld. In Lachman Lal V. Baldeo Lal 1317 the Patna High Court gives a brief summary of the origin, history and customs of the Gayāwals, remarks that though in former times there were several hundred families of Gayāwals their number is now reduced to about 150, that the Gayāwals so-called gaddi is not a hereditary office, but only a business to which a good will is attached. The Calcutta High Court decided in Dwarka nath Misser 1318 v. Rampertab Misser that persons who require religious ceremonies to be performed for their benefit are at liberty to choose the priest by whom they shall be performed, that plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration that they along with defendants are exclusively entitled to officiate as priests when pilgrims, on their way to the holy city of Gaya, perform the sraddha ceremony of their ancestors on the bank of the sacred river Punpun, and that the plaintiffs could be given a declaration that they are entitled to officiate as priests for such pilgrims as may choose to employ them for the pur pose of religious ceremonies and that the defendants are not entitled to prevent the plaintiffs from the exercise of their calling. In Narayan Lal 1319 v. Chulhan Lal the Calcutta High Court decided how the books containing the names and addresses of pilgrims kept by a joint family of Gayāwals were to be divided at the time of the partition of all the properties of the family.

contain on a very modest calculation at least 40000 verses on tirthas, sub-tirthas and legends connected with them. In the Vanaparva (chap. 82-156) and Salyaparva (chap. 35-54) alone there are about 3900 verses on tirthayātrā. To mention only a few of the Purānas, the Brahmapurāṇa devotes about 6700 verses (i. e, nearly half of its total extent of 13783 verses) to tirthas, the Padma about 4000 verses out of the 31000 verses of the first five khandas, the Varāhapurāṇa devotes about 3182 verses to tirthas (out of which about 1400 refer to Mathura) out of about 9614 verses, the Matsya about 1200 verses out of 14002. Besides these, the following well-known digests and works on tirthas deserve mention, The Tirthavivecana-kānda of the Kalpataru of Laksmidhara (G.O.S. series); the Caturvarga-1320 cintāmani of Hemādri (1260-1270 A. D.) contained a section on tirthas (no Ms, has yet been discovered); the Tirthacintamani of Vācaspati (1450-1480 A. D.) published in B. I. series; the Tirtha sāra, part of Nrsimhaprasāda about 1500 A, D. (published in the Sarasvati-bhavana series); the Tristhalisetu of Nārāyanabhatta (about 1550-1580 A, D.) printed by the Anandāsrama Press, Poona; Tirthasaukhya, a part of Todarānanda (1565-1589 A. D.); Tirthatattva or Tirthayātrāvidhitattva of Raghunandana whose literary activity lies between 1520-1570 A. D. (printed in Bengali characters and over and above the 28 tattvas of his Smrtitattva); Tirthaprakāśa by Mitramiśra about 1610-1640 (published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series); the Tristha lisetusāra-sangraha of Bhattoji (about 1625); Tristhalisetusāra sangraha of Nāgesa; the Tirthendusekhara of Nāgesa or Nāgoji (published in the Sarasvatībhavana series, Benares, 1936). There are several works on tirthas (not yet printed) mentioned in H. of Dh. vol. 1. p. 554, of which the Tirtharatnākara of Anantabhatta composed at the order of Anūpasimha is probably the largest work on tirthas (ms, no. 1822 in the Anup Library at Bikaner).

Only printed works have been drawn upon in this work (except where expressly stated otherwise).

The preliminaries before starting on a pilgrimage to any tirtha prescribed by the purāṇas and digests may be brought together. On a certain day (when a person has decided on tirtha-yātrā) he should take only one meal, then the next day he should shave himself (according to most digests) and observe a fast; then on the day after the fast he should perform his daily duties, should make a sankalpa (declaration of intention) in the form 'I shall perform a pilgrimage to such and such a place and I shall worship Ganeśa and my favourite deities for the accomplishment of the pilgrimage without obstacles'; offer worship to Ganesa, to the planets (nine) and his favourite deities with five or sixteen upacāras,1322 then perform a pārvana-śrāddha with plenty of ghee according to his own gļhyasūtra, honour three brāhmanas at least and donate some money to them. Then he should put on a pilgrim's dress as described above (p.573), go round the village in which his house is located (or at least round his own house), reach another village not more distant than one krośa (two or two and half miles) and break his fast by eating the remainder of the food cooked and ghee used for the śrāddha (this applies to pilgrimage to Gayā).

in his own house in the case of other tirthas) and then start. Then the next day he should bathe with pure clothes on and then put on his pilgrim dress and start on his pilgrim age in the forenoon with his face to the east, preferably bare-footed. There are two views here. Some say that on the day on which a man reaches a tirtha he should observe a fast, while the other view is that the pilgrim should fast on the day previous to his reaching the tirtha. In the first case he will have to perform a grāddha on the day of the fast and in that case he cannot actually taste the remnants of śrāddha food but should only smell the cooked food. The Kalpataru (on tīrtha p. 11) and the Tirtha-cintāmaṇi (p. 14) quote Davala for the proposition that a fast on reaching a tirtha is not obligatory, but if observed yields special merit.VE
