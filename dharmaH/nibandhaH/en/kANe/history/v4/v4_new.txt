The fourth Volume of Professor KANE's History of Dharmaśāstra had been out of print for the last many months; but, owing to the tight publication programme of the Institute, we were constrained to hold in abeyance, very reluctantly, the re-issue of that Volume. It is, therefore, indeed gratifying that it has now become possible for us to publish a photostat reprint of that Volume and thereby to meet, albeit partially, the pressing demands for the Volumes of that magnum opus. 

Shri S. P. Barve of the Parashuram Process of Poona has taken personal interest in the reproduction of the Volume by photo offset process and has accomplished his job with great care and expeditiousness. Our best thanks are due to him. 

It may be added that the printing of the second part of the first Volume (revised and enlarged edition ) and the reprinting of the second Volume of the History of Dharma śāstra are now in progress. It is thus hoped that the reprint of the various Volumes of this work will soon become available to the public. Till then, we crave its indulgence.

Bhandarkar Oriental Research InstitutePREFACE TO FIRST EDITION 

The third volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra was published in October 1946. In the brief preface to that volume I intiniated that the remaining topics of Dharmaśāstra would be dealt with in one volume. But as I proceeded with the task I found that that was a miscalculation. To present in one volume all the topics that remained in the manner and on the scale that I had adopted in the first three volumes was found to be impossible. Besides, as my age advanced, I could not maintain the same speed and finish the whole history in a few years as I intimated I would do in the preface to the third volume. Therefore, I had to decide, however reluctantly, to spread the remaining work over two volumes. Owing to the scarcity of paper and paucity of skilled workers, this volume has been in the press for more than three years. This volume deals with eight topics, viz. Pātaka, Prāyaścitta, Karmavipāka, Antyesti, Āsauca, Suddhi, Srāddha and Tirthayātrā. These subjects are of great interest to anthropologists. There was great temptation for me, when dealing with these topics, to indulge in dwelling upon similar beliefs, usages and rites des cribed in such works as Frazer's "Golden Bough.' For two reasons, however, I have rarely succumbed to this temptation. In the first place, there was the fear of increasing the bulk of the work which has already assumed enormous proportions. In the second place, dwelling on comparisons of ancient and medieval Indian usages and rites with similar usages and rites found elsewhere is liable to serious misunderstanding. Frazer's volumes are largely made up of materials concerning the beliefs, usages and rites of very primitive people. It appeared to me that readers of such comparisons might be led to think that people in ancient and medieval India were at a primitive stage of culture, while as a matter of fact they had a very high culture in most matters, although they retained certain beliefs and usages derived from remote antiquity. Many cultured societies retain some usages that belong to periods of antiquity. The queen in France was not to leave for a whole year the room in which the death of her consort was announced to her. Wretched old women deemed to be witches were pred secuted and sentenced to death in England up to the beginning center

History of Dharmaśāstra 

of the eighteenth century, while Manu (IX. 290) more than two thousand years ago prescribed the mild punishment of a fine of two hundred panas for all incantations intended to destroy life, for magic rites and for raising ghosts and goblins. My main aim has throughout been to discover, collect, classify and interpret the facts of the various departments of Dharmaśāstra and my endeavour has been, as far as in me lies, to present the truth with detachment and intellectual integrity and without bias (except what might have been unconsciously engendered in my mind owing to my being born and brought up in & brāhmana family ) to show the continuity, the developments and transformations in Indian beliefs, rites and usages throughout the ages and, while bringing the past in its causal relations with the present, to indicate and suggest future trends and changes in these matters. 

The fifth and last volume will mainly deal with the following subjects: vratas and utsavas; śānti rites; kāla and muhürta; paurāņa-dharma; the influence of the Pūrvamimāmsā and other śāstras on dharmaśāstra; the cosmological, religious and philosophical background of dharmaśāstra; the fundamental aspects of our culture through the ages; the impact of modern social and other ideas and trends on the dogmas and ideals of dharmaśāstra and the future of the latter. This by itself is rather an ambitious programme. Now that I am over seventy-three years of age and suffering from several ailments I have mis givings whether I would be able to write this last volume and publish it while all mental and physical faculties are sound. I am myself extremely anxious to write this last volume as early as possible and bring to a conclusion an undertaking to which I have devoted all my leisure for over thirty years regardless of monetary losses and bodily ailments. With that object in view I have given up either entirely or very largely most of my other activities and engagements and have thereby offended many of my friends. 

This volume also is full of quotations, references to inscriptions and judicial decisions. The reasons for this have 

† Prof. J. B. Bury, a distinguished Professor of History in the Cambridge University, thought that freedom from bias was not possible and was not also desirable, since a man writing history completely ree from bias would produce a colourless and dull work.

Preface 

been stated at length in the preface to the second volume and therefore they need not be repeated here. The list of additions to this volume is much larger than in the preceding volumes. I may be pardoned for frankly stating the reason. The first and second volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra were published so far back as 1930 and 1941 respectively. No second edition of these has yet been called. It seems to me quite possible that during my life-time no second edition of the volumes of the History, or at least of this volume, might appear. Therefore, I tried to incorporate by way of additions such in. formation as had escaped me while the work was being written in order to make it as complete as possible. 

I now discharge the pleasant duty of acknowledging my obligations to others. Bloomfield's Vedic Concordance, the Vedic Index of Professors Macdonell and Keith, and the volumes of the Sacred Books of the East have been very useful in pre paring this volume as in the case of its predecessors. Parama haṁsa Swāmi Kevalānanda Sarasvati of Wai has been a tower of strength in all matters of doubt and difficulty and has helped me by offering prompt guidance in solving some intricate problems. I am highly obliged to Mr. S. N. Savadi of the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona, for help in the correction of proofs and to Mr. P. M. Purandare, Advocate (O.S.). Bombay High Court, and Tarkatirtha Raghunath Shāstri Kokie of Lonavla for reading the printed sheets as they came and making valuable suggestions, 

It is difficult to name all those who in various ways, during the progress of this volume for over six years, kindly rendered assistance, but I should like to make special mention of Prof. K, V. Rangaswami Aiyangar, Mr. A. N. Krishna Aivangar Dr. A. S. Altekar, Dr. S. K. Belvalkar, Prof. G, H, Bhatt. Mr. Bhabatosh Bhattacharya, Mr. N. G. Chapekar, Dr. R. N. Dandekar. Mr. D. B. Diskalkar, Dr. G.S. Gai, Prof. P. K. Gode. Tarka-tirtha Laksmanashāstri Joshi, Mr. G. H. Khare, Pandit Balacharya Khuperkar, Dr. Umesha Mishra, Dr. V. Raghavan. Prof. L. Renou, Prof. H. D. Velankar. Thanks are due to these scholars and many others for help and interest in this volume. I am conscious that in spite of so much help and generous encouragement from friends there are in this volume several D mistakes, the sole responsibility for which rests on my shoulders In a work replete with thousands of quotations and references

it is quite likely that many slips have escaped my attention.g For these and for the elision of a few diacritical marks and the displacement of parts of Sanskrit letters in the process of printing the indulgence and forgiveness of all readers are sought. I sincerely thank the Manager of the Aryabhushan Press Poona, for carrying out the work of printing this volume with care in spite of difficulties caused by paper and labour shortage. 

BOMBAY 10-10-1953 S 

P. V. KANE 

$ I take this opportunity of correcting two mistakes that I regret I committed in the third volume of the History of Dharmasastra. In note 1886 on p. 968 (of vol. III) I refer to a work of Mr. Batuknath Bhattacharya that contains a full treatment of Kalivariya. I suggested in that note that Mr. Bhattacharya probably retouched his thesis after 1937 though it was written in 1933, in view of the fact that he referred to the Smrtimuktāphala (which was published in 1937 by Mr. Gharpure). Through oversight I forgot that Mr. Bhattacharya had expressly stated that he used the transcript of a ms. of the Smrtimuktāphala specially made for him. Therefore, I was wrong in my surmise that he probably retouched his thesis and I must say that the thesis as published in 1943 is the same as that written in 1933 for the Jogendrachandra Ghose Research Prize. The second mistake refers to Dr. U. N. Ghosal on p. 32 (of vol. III). I stated it is not possible to hold as Jayaswal, U. Ghosal and others do that the theory of social contract was the earlier one and the theory of divine right of kings was later on propound ed by the Manusmrti to support the brābmana empire of Pusya mitra'. In writing this sentence my memory was at fault. I find that Dr. Ghosal does not hold the view that I attributed to him. In the Indian Historical Quarterly' (vol. 23, pp. 68-70) Dr. Ghosal justly protests against my bracketing him with Jayaswal, but I cannot help observing that the last sentence in the paper shows unexpected acerbity. In his whole career as a che writer Dr. Ghosal was not probably guilty of a single slip and could not therefore bring himself to believe that my mistake might have been bona Valede

CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE 

OF some important Sanskrit works and authors referred 

to in volume IV 

N. B.-Some dates, particularly of ancient works, are conjectural and disputed by several scholars. Most of the dates about authors from the 8th or 9th century refer to the probable periods of their literary activity except in the case of a few authors such as Sankarācārya and Vidyāpati. 4000 B. C.-1000 B, C.-The period of the Vedic Samhitas, 

Brāhmanas and Upanisads. Some hymns of the Rgveda, of the Atharvaveda, and in the Taittiriya Samhita and Brāhmana may possibly go back to a period earlier than 4000 B. C. and some of the Upanisads (even from among those that are regarded by most scholars as the earliest ones) may be later than 1000 B. C. Some scholars have criticized me for ascribing the ve sambitās to such an early date as 4000 B.C. Time and health permitting, I may have to deal with this question in a separate work after I finish the 5th and last volume on which I am now

20 The Article on sin in Hasting's Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics (vol. 11) will clearly show how the idea of sin varies from religion to religion, from age to age and from coun try to country. We are concerned here with the growth and developinent of the doctrine of sin in India from Vedic times to the medieval digests and commentaries on Dharmaśāstra, do 

1o Sin (pātaka) is a word that belongs to the terminology of religion rather than to that of Ethics. 1 It is very difficult to define sin. In a general way it may be said that it is an act which is regarded as a wilful rebellion against or disobedience of some law supposed to be laid down by God or Revelation; it is opposition to the will of God manifested in an authoritative work or at least failure to abide by the regulations contained therein.

1. In these days many people, both in the East and the West, ques tion the very existence of sin. As Barbour puts it in his 'Sin and the new Psychology' (p. 19) "The feeling is gaining wide acceptance that there is no such thing as sin in the Christian sense, Evil may encompass a man's life and bring disaster to his personality, but it is not sin. It is psychic evil that can be explained by psychic causes and perhaps cured by psycho logical therapy. ... Many say nothing is right and nothing is wrong. Every thing is the result of complexes'. It has resulted in an easy tolerance of sin". Sir Oliver Lodge in his article on Christian Doctrine in the Hibbert Journal for 1903-4 at p. 466 says 'The higher man of to-day is not worrying about his sins at all, still less about their punishments. His mission, if he is good for anything, is to be up and doing and in so far as he acts wrongly or unwisely he expects to suffer'. The followers of Car vāka who was the prince of Atheists in ancient India used to say 'man should live among pleasures as long as life lasts; he should feed himself sumptures ously (lit, should drink ghee) even by borrowing money from others Thero is no coming again into the world after the body is reduced to asbes by cremation'.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

The Rgveda is full of fervent and heart-felt expressions of the sense of sin and betrays intense desire on the part of the sages of old to be free from it. The idea of sin in the Rgveda is bound up with the conception of ta. The conception of rta cannot be disoussed here in detail. But a brief statement is absolutely necessary in order to be able to convey what the Vedic doctrine of sin was.2 

Rta had a threefold aspect. It means 'the course of nature' or 'the regular and general order in the cosmos '; with reference to sacrifice it means the correct and ordered way of the cult of the Gods'; and thirdly, it also means the moral conduct of man'. A few passages to illustrate these three aspects of rta may be cited here. Rg. IV. 23. 8-10 are 3 three verses in which the word rta occurs no less than twelve times and which breathe the all-pervading influence of rta throughout the universe. 

Plentiful waters (or riches or gifts) belong to rta; the thought (or laudation) of șta destroys crooked acts (sins), the brilliant and rousing hymn of praise to sta pierces the benumbed ears of man. The props of sta are firm, its (physical) manifestations are many and lovely for the sake of the body (i. e, man). Through ta they (people) desire food. The cows (sun's rays) entered rta by fta.. He who wins over {ta acquires it. For the sake of rta (heaven) and earth are wide and deep; the two high est cows (i. e. Heaven and Earth) yield milk (desires or rewards) for the sake of sta.' Some other passages are: "The Sindhus (rivers ) follow the șta of Varuņa' (ștam sindhavo Varuṇasya yanti, Rg. II. 28. 4); similarly Rg. I. 105. 12 (ftamarṣanti sin dhavaḥ); The wheel of șta (i, e. the year) revolves round the 

2. For the conception of rta and the idea of sin in the Rgveda the following works may be consulted: "The religion of the Veda' by M. Bloomfield (pp. 12, 125 ff); Religion and philosophy of the Veda and Upa nishads' by Prof. A, B, Keith (pp. 35, 83-85 &c.): "The Vedic idea of sin by Dr. Henry Lefever (1935). One regrets to observe that Bloomfield's work is marred here and there by a certain levity of thought and expression out of keeping with the seriousness of the subject. 

3. ऋतस्य हि शुरुधः सन्ति पूर्वीक्रतस्य धीतिवृजिनानि हन्ति । ऋतस्य श्लोको पधिरा ततर्द कर्णा बुधानः सुचमान आयोः॥ऋतस्य हळूहा धरुणानि सन्ति पुरूण चन्दा वपुषे षषि। ऋतेन दीर्घमषणन्त पृक्ष ऋतेन गाव ऋतमाविवेशः॥ तं येमान ऋतमिद्वनोवृतस्य शुष्मस्तुरया 3 rey:1 ara geeft ng pag ug GETTI . IV. 23. 8-10. These are rather obscure verses. The Nirukta X. 41 understands sta to mean water and explains X. 23.8 as 'Party ya sofrera era pregrante muf आतृणत्ति । बधिरः बद्धोत्रः। कर्णो बोधयन दीप्यमानश्च आयोः अयनस्य मनुत्यका ज्योतिषो बा उदकस्य था।

Meaning of rta 

sky with twelve spokes (dvādaśāram .. ........ varvarti cakram pari dyām-stasya, Rg. I. 164. 11); 'the dawn, the daughter of heaven, correctly follows the path of rta .........' ('rtasya pan thānam-anyeti sādhu', Rg. I. 124. 3); the young woman (Usas) doǝs not destroy (or come in the way of the light of sta (Rg. I. 123.9.); the sun is the bright and lovely face of ita (Rg. VI. 51. 1. 'rtasya suci dargatam-anikam); 'the path of sta became united with the rays' (Rg. I. 136.2); 'when exhilarated by drink - ing this (Soma) Indra released for the sake of rta the concealed host of cows' (Rg. I. 121. 4, probably a reference to drought and subsequent rainfall). 

Many of the principal gods of the Vedic pantheon are described as the guardians, promoters or charioteers of sta. Mitra and Varuņa rule over all the world by rta (Rg V. 63.7, rtena vigvam bhuvanam vi rājathah); Mitra and Varuņa, the protectors of rta, occupy a chariot (Rg. V. 63.1); Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman are said to be charioteers of rta (yüyamrtasya rathyah, VII. 66.12); they and Aditi and Bhaga are protectors of sta (Rg. VI. 51.3). Agni is called 'the charioteer of rta' (rathi ftasya, Rg. III. 2.8), the protector of sta, in Rg. I. 1.8, 111, 10.2, X. 8.5, X.118.7 and ștāvān (in Rg IV.2.1). Soma is styled the protector of rta (in Rg. IX. 48.4, IX, 73.8) and is said to support rta (IX. 97.24 ptam bharat subhrtam cārvindub). In Rg. VII. 66.13 the Adityas are said to be stāvan (acting according to the fixed order of nature), rtajāta (sprung from sta) and stāvědh (augmenting or rejoicing in fta) and further they are said to be fierce haters of anyta (what is opposed to sta). 

Rta is distinguished from sacrifice (yajña). It is not any particular sacrificial rite itself nor the institution of sacrifice. It stands for the ordered course of sacrifice in general. In Rg. IV.3.4. Agni is styled stacit (conversant with or observing fta) and is inyoked to know the rta (of the sacrifice); in several verses we meet with the words 'stena ṣtam' (e. g. in Rg. IV. 3.9 stena stam niyatam-iļa ā goħ', V. 15.2 értena stam dharuņam dhārayanta yajñasya sāke, V. 68.4 ștam-stena sapantā .conform ing to or joining yta with yta', where 'ftena' appears to mean the correct course of sacrificial rites and 'rtam' the settled order in the universe. Soma is said to be the thread of rta spread on dasāpavitra (Rg. IX, 73.9 'ptasya tantur-vitataḥ pavitra ā). In

Rg. I. 84.4 it is said 'O Indra, drink this (soma) that is extracted ...the streams of the bright (soma) flow towards thee in the seat of ștal (i. e. in the soma sacrifice). Vide also Rg. IV. 1.13-- (asmākam-atra pitaro manusyā abhi pra sedur-rtam-ā suņānāḥ) 'in this world former men, our ancestors, approached rta etc.'; Rg. I. 71.3 (dadhannstam dhanayannasya dhitim-ādidaryo)' Rg. X 67.2 (ftam śamsanta rju didhyānā...yajñasya dhāma prathamam mananta) 'the Angirasas,, declaring the sta and reflecting straightforwardly first thought of the abode of Yajña'; Rg. X. 37.1 (maho devāya tad-itam saparyata, 'offer this rta to the great God). 

The conception of rta as a moral imperative occurs in several passages. Rg. I. 90.6 (madhu vātā rtāyate madhu kṣaranti sindhavah) 'the winds carry sweets, the rivers do the same to him who keeps rta'; Rg. V. 12.2 'O Agni, that knowest rta, know ita alone (in me)......I shall not resort to magic either by force or by duplicity, I shall conform to sta of the reddish bull (i. e. of Agni)s; Rg. X. 87.11 'O Agoil may the evil spirit who injures șta by anṣta be thrice bound in thy fetters'. Yama in rejecting Yami's advances says (Rg. X. 10.4) "What indeed we never did before (shall we do it now?); shall we who have spoken rta (so far) now speak anrta ?' (rtā vadanto anţtam rapema). 

In two or three instances ita appears to be almost personifi ed and invoked as a divinity. 'O Agnil for us offer sacrifice to Mitra and Varuna, to the gods and to the great (brhat) ta' (Rg I. 75. 5). Similarly, in Rg. X. 66,4 the great (mahat) pta is mentioned alongside of Aditi, Heaven and Earth, Indra, Viṣnu, the Maruts &c. 

Rta and satya were distinguished in several passages of the Rgveda. For exansple, Rg. V. 51.2 speaks of the Viśve Devas as ‘rtadhītayaḥ' (whose thoughts were fixed on fta) and 'satyadharmāṇaḥ' (whose characteristic is truth or whose dharmas are true). In Rg. IX. 113,4 rta and satya both occur and appear to mean almost the same thing. In Rg. X. 190.1 sta and saty a are distinguished as having sprung from 'tapas'. Rta involves a wider conception and satya had originally a restricted mean ing (viz. truth or static order). The word anţta, however, is the

Meaning of yta 

opposite of both rta and satya as may be seen from Rg. X. 10.4, Rg. VII. 49.3 (Varuna who marks the satya and anyta of people), Rg. X. 124,5 (Varuna who separates anrta by means of rta). Gradually, however, the word yta receded into the back-ground and satya took its place even in Vedic literature, though here and there (as in Tai. Up. II. 1 and 1.9.3) both Țta and satya are found in juxtaposition. 

The sages of the Rgveda were acutely conscious of sin or guilt and pray to the gods, particularly to Varuna and the Adityas, for forgiveness and for being freed from the consequ ences of sin. In this connection they employ numerous words such as āgas, enas, agha, durita, duṣkrta, drugdha, ainhas. A few examples of the employment of these words may be cited here. The most frequent words are ūgas and enas, both of which appear to import sin in its deepest and most ethical sense. Rg. VII, 86 is a hymn to Varuna in which there are several verses that breathe a deep and heart-felt consciousness of guilt. The sage begins in verse 3 by saying that all wise men of whom he inquired told him the same thing viz. 'Varuna is angry with you'. Then the sage proceeds 'O Varuņal what is that great guilt (āgas) (of mine) whereby you desire to injure your worship per and a friend ? Declare that to me, then I shall quickly approach thee with an obeisance and be free from sin (enas). Cast away from us the transgressions (drugdha) of our father and those that we committed in our own person ;...free Vasistha (from guilt) like a calf from the rope (that binds it)'. In Rg. VII, 89.5 (almost equal to Atharva-veda VI. 51.3) the sage says 'whatever transgressions (abhidroha) we who are mere men have practised as against the divine hosts and whatever dharmas laid down by you we may have confounded through our ignorance (or heedlessness) do not destroy us on account of that guilt (enas).' It will be noticed that in these verses the words āgas, abhidroha and enus are employed in the same verses and therefore practi cally mean the same thing. In Rg. II. 27.14 the sage prays 'O Aditi! O Mitra10 Varunal take pity on us though we may have committed some sin against you'. In Rg. II. 28.5 Varuņa is implored to loosen sin (āgas) from the devotee just like a girdle. Rg. VIII, 45.34 states: 'O Indral do not kill us for one sin, for two sins or three sins or for many (āgas).' In Rg. II. 29.1 the Adityas are imploredo 'cast away from me sin (āgas) as a woman who gives birth to a child in secret'. For some other passagen

Agas and enas are employed in the same verse, Rg. 1V.12.4 'O Agni! Whatever sin (āgas) we may have committed through heedlessness make us free from it before Aditi and loosen from us our sins (enas) from all sides'. 

Some more passages about enas are: Rg. VI, 51.7 'May we not have to enjoy (i. o. suffer for ) the enas committed by another and Rg. VI. 51.8 'Whatever sin be committed by me I shall remove it by obeisance'; Rg. VI. 74.3 'O Soma and Rudral Loosen from us and cast away from us whatever sin attaches to our person'; Rg. VII, 20.1 'Indra is our saviour even from a great sin'; vide also Rg. I. 189. 1, II, 28, 7, VII. 52. 2. The word 'agha', also seems to mean sin. 'Apa naḥ śogucad-agham' (may our sins perish) is the refrain of Rg. 1.97.1-8. "O gods! May your fetters and may sins (aghāni) be far away from us' (II. 29. 5, in which verse in the first half 'āgah' occurs); X. 117. 6 (kevalāgho bhavati kevaladi) 'one who simply eats food alone (without offering to others) reaps only sin'. 

Another word is ainhas. The following passages may be cited. In Rg. II. 28. 6 Varuna is implored 'remove amhas (sin ) as one removes the rope from the (neck) of the calf; one has not the power even to wink without you ( your favour )'? It should be noted that in the preceding verse (II. 28.5) already quoted the simile of the girdle is employed with regard to āgas. 'May Indra take us away from amhas as persons on both sides ( of a river) call one who is going in a boat' (Rg. III. 32. 14.); ‘No evil caused by the gods or by men reaches him from any side who worships Agni with fuel, oblation or sacrifices 'Rg. VIII. 19. 6; "May Aditi, the mother of the affluent Mitra and Varuna, save us from all sin' (Rg. X, 36, 3).' Rg. X. 36, 2 also prays Heaven and Earth, the upholders of sta, to protect the sage from 'amhas'. Vide also Rg. X, 126, %. 

Another important word is vrjina which is often placed in opposition to sādhu or Țju. The Adityas are said to see inside

Rgvedic words for 'sin' 

(the hearts of men) sins as well as good (thoughts and actions) '10 and it is added that everything though far-off is near to them who are kings. In Rg. II. 27. 2 the Adityas are called 'avrjināh' (free from vrjina). The Sun is said to mark among men their right and sinful deeds (Rg. IV. 1. 17). The same words (rju marteņu vrjinā ca paśyan) occur in Rg. VI. 51. 2 and VII, 60.2 about the Sun. 

The word 'antta' is often used in the Rgveda. It has already been shown how Varuna is said to mark the satya and anrta of men. In Rg. VII. 60.5 it is said 'these gods, Mitra, Aryaman and Varuņa mark (or know) many sins; they flourish in the abode of rta'. Rg. VII. 66. 13 calling Mitra, Varuna and Aryaman haters of ansta has already been quoted (in n. 4). 

The word 'durita' is sometimes used in the sense of sin. In Rg. I. 23. 22 the waters are invoked as follows: 11 "O waters! carry away from me whatever sin may exist in me, whatever transgressions I may have been guilty of as regards my sensual appetite or whatever falsehood I may have uttered'. Here all three words “durita, droha and ansta' are brought together and convey almost the same idea, viz. sin or guilt against the law of the Gods. In Rg. I. 185. 10 Heaven and Earth are called father and mother and are invoked to save the worshipper from durita (sin) which involves blame (pātām-avadyād-duritad). 'Avadya' means 'garhya' acc. to Pāṇ. III, 1. 101. Rg. VII. 82. ny states 'Him neither amhas (sin) nor durita nor worry reaches from anywhere to whose sacrifice you go, O Mitra and Varuna!'. In Rg. X. 126. 1 'amhas' and 'durita' are brought together (na tam-amho na duritam devāso asta martyam). In Rg. VIII. 67. 21 the words amhati and rapas 12 seem to be employed in the sense of sin. 'Duskrta' (evil deed) is used in the sense of sin in Rg. VIII. 47. 13 and in Rg. X. 164, 3 Agni is implored to keep far away from the worshipper all sins 13. The word 'pāpa' generally14

occurs in the Rg. in the sense of 'sinner' (Rg. VIII, 61. 11, X. 10.12, IV. 5.5) or 'sinful' or 'evil' (Rg. X. 108. 6, X. 164.5, I. 129. 11). In Rg. VII. 32. 18, VII. 94. 3, VIII. 19. 26 'pāpatva' occurs and appears to mean 'sinfulness'. In the Brāhmaṇas 'pāpam' (neuter) occurs in the sense of 'sin' as in Sat. Br. XI. 2. 7. 19; vide also 15 Ait. Br. 33. 5. In the Upaniṣads ‘pāpam' means 'sin' (e. g. in Tai. Up. II. 9, Chāndogya IV. 14. 3). Certain important modifications of the doctrine about sin and Karma were introduced in the Upaniṣads and the Bhagavadgitā, which will be discussed later on. 

In spite of the voluminous references to the consciousness of guilt and sin in the Rgveda and to the transgression of divine laws briefly indicated above, European scholars were not want ing who boldly affirmed that the idea of sin was altogether unknown to the Rgvedic sages. Vide S. B. E. vol. I. p. XXII where Max-Muller replies 'the gradual growth of the concept of guilt is one of the most interesting lessons which certain passages of these ancient hymns can teach us.' 

How sin arises in the individual mind has been a difficult problem at all times16 Men are conscious of the sins they commit, though they may have no definite conclu sions or theories about the origin of sin. In the Rg. VII. 86. 6 a sage' pleads with Varuņa that sin is not due to a man's own power, but it is rather due to fate, to surā (intoxicants), to anger, dice or heedlessness and even dream state leads one to commit what is not right. In the Kausitaki-brāhmaṇopanigad (III. 9) it is stated : 'the Lord of all makes that man perform good works whom He desires to raise to higher worlds 

15. सहोवाचाजीगतः सौयवसिस्तद्वै मा तात तपति पापं कर्म मया कृतम् । ऐ. बा. 33.5 ( = VII.17.) 

16. Christianity seems to have solved it by stating that the source of actual sin is the Devil (Matthew 13.39) and by the legend of Adam's Fall (vide Romans 5. 12 'as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin') it affirmed that there was a dose of original sin in all men. In modern times many people don't accept the idea of 'original sin'; for example, Sir Oliver Lodge says (in his article on Christian Doctrine') in Hibbert Journal for 1903-4 at p. 466 "As for original sin' or 'birth sin' or other notion of that kind ... that sits absolutely lightly on him (the man of to-day). As a matter of fact it is non-existent, and none but a monk could have Invented it.

How sin arises in men's minds 

than these and He makes that man commit bad deeds whom He wishes to drag down'.18 Here it appears to be suggested that some men are chosen by God for being saved and some are chosen for being damned. This sounds like the Calvinistic doctrine of pre-destination. In the Bhagavadgita (III. 36) Arjuna questions Srikrsna as follows: 'impelled by whom does a man commit sin as if constrained thereto by force, even though he does not desire to do so'? The answer given is (III. 37) 'it is Just and anger springing from the element (guna) of rajas (passion) that are the enemies of man in this world. In another place the Bhagavadgitā (XVI. 21) says 'this19 is the three-fold door or entrance to Hell that is ruinous to the self viz. lust, anger and greed; therefore a man must shun these three.' But it must be said that this does not go to the real root of the matter. The question is why should carnal lust, anger or greed themselves arise in the mind of man. The only answer that is indicated is in accordance with the tenets of the Samkhya philosophy viz. that there are three gupas, sattva, rajas and tamas which combine in various proportions in different men and that it is rajo guna that is the cause of man's sinfulness. In the Santi parva, chap. 163, it is stated that there are thirteen very powerful enemies of men beginning with anger (krodha) and kāma (lust) and it is said that krodha springs from lobha (covet ousness), which latter arises from ignorance (verses 7 and 11). But there is no satisfactory discussion of the origin of ignorance in that chapter. Gautama 19.2 observes20 that 'man in this world is polluted by a vile action such as sacrificing for a man unworthy to offer a sacrifice, eating forbidden food, speaking what ought not to be spoken, neglecting what is prescribed and practising what is forbidden'. Yajñavalkya III, 219 prescribes : 'by

omitting to do what is ordained, by resorting to what is con demned (prohibited) and by not controlling the senses, man incurs fall (i. e. sin). Manu XI, 44 and sāntiparva 34.2 are similar verses. The Mitākṣarā explains that matters ordained are such as performing Sandhya (morning and evening adorations) and Agnihotra and what are condemned are such actions as drinking liquor. Visvarūpa explains that patana (fall or sinful ness) in Yāj. III. 219 is not used in the technical sense attached to that word by Gautama 21.4 viz. 'to be a patita means to be deprived of the right to follow the lawful occupations of twice born men,' but it is used only in the sense that the man so acting (as mentioned in Yāj. III. 219) becomes liable to undergo prāyaścitta and that the words of Gautama (21.4) are restricted only to what are called mahāpātakas. The word pātaka is derived from the causal of the root "pat.' Vide Medhatithi on Manu XI,54 'pātakaśabdah patayatiti vyutpattyā sarva-vyatikra mesu vartate' and Madanapārijāta p. 786. In ancient works the word pataniya (meaning the cause of patana) has been employed as in Āp. Dh, S.I.7.21.7. The Pr. V. (p. 35) paraphrases patanīyāni by 'patakāni' and derives it from the root 'pat' (patatyanena iti pataniyam) with the addition of the termination ‘aniya' according to Pāṇ. III, 3.113. The word occurs also in Yāj. II. 210, III, 297, Sankha quoted by Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 237 (in prose) and other smộtis. 

The enumeration of sinful acts and the classifications of sins into several degrees or grades has gone on from very anci ent times. In the Rg. X. 5. 6 it is said21 the wise made (lit. chiselled ) seven limits; the man who goes against even one of them becomes sinful'. The Nirukta (VI. 27 ) explains that the seven sins indicated in this verse are theft, violating the bed (of the guru ), murder of a brāhmaṇa, murder of a bhrūņa, drinking of liquor, continual performance of the same sinful act, telling a lie as to a sinful matter'. Rg. VII. 86. 6 quoted above (in n. 17) makes it clear that drinking surā and playing with dice were regarded as sinful. From the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 2, V. 3. 12. 1-2, Sat. Br. XIII, 3. 1. 1. and other Brāhmana texts it appears that the murder of a brāhmaṇa was generally regarded in early vedic times as the gravest of all sins, though in the Kathaka samhita (31. 7) it is stated that there is no sin as

heinous as killing a bhrūna which is even worse than brāhmana murder )22. The Tai. Br. in detailing the story of Ekata, Dvita and Trita who was made a scapegoat for keeping off sins, enumerates the following sinners, viz, sūryābhyudita (one who sleeps on when the sun rises ), süryābhinimrukta (one who slept when the sun set ), one who has black nails or teeth, agradidhuṣu (one who married a younger sister while the elder sister was yet unmarried ), the elder brother remaining unmarried even though a younger brother has married, one who allows his sacred sacrificial fires to be extinguished, the killer of a brāhmana 23. It may be noticed that most of these occur almost in the same order in Āp. Dh, S. II. 5. 12. 22 where it is24 said that though 

22. Bhrūnahan is either a killer of a learned brahmana or the killer of a foetus when its sex is not known. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II, p. 148n and vol. III. p. 6120 for quotations and explanations. It may be noted that the four main prohibitions contained in the Decalogue (Exodus, chap. 20. 13-16 and Deut. 5. 17-20 ) against killing human beings, theft, adultery and bearing false witness are to be found in all well-known religious or moral codes.

It may be noted that both brothers (elder and younger) and sisters (elder and younger) were held guilty of sin in case of supercession in mar riage. Ora and uita often mean the same thing (viz, an elder brother before whom a younger brother marries or consecrates sacrificial fires). Vide Manu III. 171-172. Acc, to Manu III. 173 a didhiṣüpati is one who feels love for his brother's widow and has intercourse with her under the system of niyoga. परिविविदान is the same as परिवत्ता. अग्रेदिधिषु or-y is explained by Devala and by Apararka p. 451, by Haradatta on Gaut. 15.15 and Mit, on Yāj. III. 26 as 'a younger sister who marries before her elder sister' and FETETT दिधिषू is the elder sister who is thus superceded by a younger one. In Ap. the word पंति is to be connected with both अयोदिधिषू and दिधिवू. The Amarakosa explains Perug differently. gra (17. 43-44) makes even the father or other guardian for marriage getting a younger son or daughter married before an elder one) and the priest officiating at such a marriage equally guilty.

these actions are not to be styled pataniyas according to Ap. yet they cause impurity which being greater and greater in each succeeding one requires higher and higher penances. Ap. adds a few more sinners to those in the Tai. Br. viz. didhiṣu pati (husband of an elder sister whose younger sister was married before her), paryāhita (an elder brother before whom a younger brother kindled fires ), parivividāna la younger brother who takes bis share of the ancestral property before his elder brother), parivinna (an elder brother before whom a younger brother takes away his share of the ancestral property). The Chăndogya Upaniṣad25 (V. 10. 9.) quotes a verse that declares that the five great sinners are the thief of gold, the drinker of surā, the violator of the guru's bed, the murderer of a brāhmana, and one who associates with any of the preceding four. The Br. Up. (IV. 3. 22 ) mentions as great sinners the thief and the murderer of a bhrūņa. 

Boldog Coming to the sūtras there is great divergence as to the classification of sins and the enumeration of sins in each class. The Āp. Dh. S, divides sins into two classes viz. pataniya (those that cause loss of caste), aśucikara (those that cause impurity. though no loss of caste is caused). Āp. Dh, S. (1.7.21.7–11) states that pataniya sins are theft (of gold), crimes whereby one becomes an abhigasta, complete loss (by neglect) of the Vedic learning that one secured by study, destruction of a foetus, incestuous connection with relations born of the same womb as one's father or mother and with the children of such persons, drinking of surā, intercourse with persons with whom intercourse is for bidden, intercourse with the female friend of one's female guru (mother &c.) or with the female friend of one's guru (father &c.) and with the wife of any stranger, constant commission of immoral acts (adharma) other than those already mentioned. Āp. Dh, S. I. 7.21.10 notes that, according to some, intercourse with a woman who is not the wife of a guru is not a pataniya sin. Among acts which render a man impure are (Ap. Dh, S, I. 7. 21. 12-18) the cohabitation of an Ārya woman with sūdras, eating the flesh of forbidden animals such as that of a dog or a human being or village cock or pig or other carnivorous animals, eating the excrement of human beings, partaking of food left by a sūdra, and cohabitation by Arya men with apapātra

women.26 According to some, those acts that are declared to be asuciliaura are also pataniyas.sAp. Dh. S. (I. 7.21.19) states that acts other than those enumerated are also asucikara. Ap. Dh, S. (L9.24.6-9) enumerates those who are abhisasta, viz. one who slays a person belonging to the first two varņas (viz. brāhmana and ksatriya) who had studied the Veda or who had been initiated for the performance of a soma sacrifice, one who kills a more brāhmaṇa (though he may not have studied the Veda or be not initiated for a soma sacrifice), also one who destroys the embryo of a brāhmaṇa even though its sex be undisting uishable, or slays a woman who is an ātreyi (in her monthly course). The Vasisthadharmasūtra divides 27 sinners into three classes, viz.- those who are enasvins, those guilty of mahāpātakas and those guilty of upapātakas (I. 19-23). Among those who are styled enasvinah are those mentioned in Ap. Dh. S. II 5.12.22, with this difference that the 'brahmojjha', who is included among 'pataniyas' by Ap. Dh, S. I. 7. 21. 9 is put among 'enasvins' by Vasistha. In Vas. 20.4-12 special prayascittas for each of these enasvinah' (ordinary sinners) are prescribed. The Mahāpātakas (mortal sins) according to Vasistha are five, viz (violating) a guru's bod, drinking of spirituous liquor, murder of a bhrūņa (a learned brāhınana), stealing gold from a brāhmapa and associating with a patita. Those guilty of upapātakas (minor sins) are: He who forsakes sacred Vedio fires, he who offends a guru, an atheist, he who earns his livelihood from atheists, and he who sells the soma plant. The Baudhāyana Dharmasūtra28 (II. 1) divides sins into pataniya, upapātaka and asucikara. Among the first it cites making voyages by sea, stealing the property of a brāhmana or misappropriating a deposit, giving false evidence

The upapatakas, acc. to Bāud. Dh. S. (II. 1. 60-61), are: intercourse with females who must not be approached, cohabita tion with the female friend of a female guru or with the female friend of a male guru or with an apapātra woman or with a female outcast, following the profession of medicine, officiating as a priest for a village, living by dramatic performances, following the profession of a teacher of dancing or singing or acting, tending cows and buffaloes 30 and similar (low occupa tions) and fornication.

Gautama (21.1-3) appears to include among patanjyas the usual five mortal sins and also some of those that are mentioned by Ap. Dh, S. (I.7. 21. 9-11) and Vasiṣtha I. 23 (such as nāstika) and adds a few more (such as not casting off persons guilty of pataniyas, for saking blameless relatives and instigating others to commit acts causing loss31 of caste. 

be 29. That this is the correct translation of Baud. and not the one in S. B. E. vol. XIV p. 218 'becoming thereby her son' is clear from Manu III. 16 311074 Haren eta 71'. Saunaka condemned the begetting of a son from a sūdra female (and not the begetting of a daughter), while Bhrgu condemned the begetting of a child (whether male or female did not matter).

Classification of sins 

The above statement about the classification of sins and their inclusion among the several classes or grades of sins will show that among the early sutra works there was no general agreement about the nature and number of mahāpātakas, upapātakas and other classes of sins, even though as early as the Chāndogya Upanisad the mortal sins had been declared to be five. It must be supposed that that Upanisad represented only one school of thought in the times of Āp., Baud, and Gaut., who did not entirely accept the tradition of that Upanisad, but followed other divergent ideas. It is impossible to suppose that the verse quoted in that Upaniṣad is later than the Dharma sūtras of Āp., Gaut., Baud., and Vas. 

It appears that Katyāyana 32 divided sinful acts into five classes viz. mahāpāpa (mortal sins), atipāpa (the highest sins than which there is nothing worse), pātaka (sins similar to mahā pātakas), prāsangika (due to association or contact) and upapātaka (minor sins). The Bhavisya-purana also says that those sins that are declared to be equal to mahāpātakas (by Manu and others) are called pātakas. Vțddha-Hārīta also (IX. 215-216) speaks of five kinds viz. mahāpāpa, pātaka, anupātaka, upapāpa and prakirnaka (miscellaneous) and states (IX. 216-218) that those sins which are said to be like mahāpātaka are pātakas. that anupatakas are sins lesser than pātakas, that upapatakas are lesser than pātakas and prakırnaka sins are the least sinful of all. The Viṣnudharmasutra (33,3-5) speaks of nine kinds of lapses viz. atipātaka, mahāpātaka, anupātaka, upapātaka, jātibhramsakara (effecting loss of caste), sankarikarana, (rendering one as degraded as a man of a mixed caste), apātri karana (rendering the perpetrator unworthy of receiving a gift), malāvaha (causing defilement) and prakırnaka (miscellaneous). Atipātakas, acc. to Visnu Dh. S. 34.1, are sexual intercourse with one's mother, daughter or daughter-in-law and the only expiation for them is entering fire. Manu omits the separate mention of atipātaka and anupātaka and includes most of them under those that he designates as equal to one of the four well known mahāpātakas. Katyāyana quoted in the Prāyaścitta muktavali of Divākara (folio 3 a) adds sexual intercourse with one's sister as atipātaka to the three mentioned by Visnu

[Vol. Harita Dh. S. (it appears) quoted by the Mit. knew33 of a variety of pātakas called anupātaka, but from the way in which the several pātakas are arranged it looks as if atipātaka in Harita was a lesser sin than mahāpātaka. Manu (in chap. XI) refers to all the kinds of patakas found in the Visnu-dharmasūtra except atipātakas. Usually five mahāpātakas have been enumerated from the days of the Chāndogya Up. (quoted on p. 12) viz, brāhmaṇa murder, drinking spirituous liquor, theft (generally understood as theft of brāhmaṇa's gold), sexual intercourse with the wife of a guru and association with the perpetrators of any of these four (for a year34). Vide Vas. I. 19-20, Manu XI, 55, 180, Yāj. III. 227, 261), Visnudharmsūtra 35.1-5, Viddha-Hārita IX. 174. Manu mentions certain sins as equal to Mahāpātakas which are styled anupatakas by the Visnudharmasūtra chap. 36. The most elaborate treatment of all kinds of sins in the smrtis is found in Manu, Yāj and Viṣnu. There is difference of opinion even among these three on certain points. For example, Manu35 XI, 56 says that forgetting the Veda, reviling the Vedas, giving false evidence, slaying a friend, eating forbidden food and food that is unfit for eating or should not be eaten, are lapses similar to drinking surā; while Yăj. III. 228 states that three out of these (viz, reviling the Vedas, slaying a friend and forgetting the Veda studied by a person) along with the reviling of a guru by attri buting false faults are similar to the murder of a brāhmana. The result is that there is an option as to the expiation to be prescribed for these sins.

Details of Mahūpātakas 

It would be desirable to give some details as regards each of the mahāpatakas and then to describe the other varieties of sins and then to set out the expiations prescribed for all of them. It should be noted that both the secular law of penalties and the ecclesiastical rules about expiations made a difference between a sinful act intentionally committed (kāmatah) and one com mitted through ignorance or heedlessness and between an act done only once ( sakrt ) or done repeatedly (asakrt) 

Brahmahatyā. Hatyā or vadha (killing ) is applied to an act which immediately or after some time results in causing loss of life directly without the intervention of any other cause.36. The Agnipurāṇa (173, 1), the Mit., the Prāyascittaviveka (p. 47) and other works define what is meant by vadha. A man may be the cause of the death of a brāhmaṇa in five ways, viz. he may himself kill (i. e. he becomes the kartā), he may incite another to kill (prayojaka) by ordering that other to do so (as a king or noble by ordering his servant) or by imploring another to kill and giving advice about the killing, he may encourage another to kill by his own approval (anumanta ), or by helping the killer when he wavers or by offering protection to the killer against others ( anugrāhaka ) and by becoming a nimitta.37 

The Mit. on Yāj. III. 227 and 243 (quoting verses from Paithinasi) explains all these at length. For the definition of anugrāhaka it relies on a verse of Manu Where many persons are armed and have a common purpose in view, if even one of them kills a person, all of them are guilty of murder', which is very much like sec. 34 of the Indian Penal Code. This distinc tion into several degrees of killers is an ancient one and is based on Āp. Dh. S. II. 11. 29. 1-2 "He who?8 instigates, he who approves, and he who commits an act--these share its results in heaven and hell; but he amongst these who contributes most to

the accomplishment of the act obtains a greater share of the results'. A nimittin39 is defined by Mit. as one that angers ano ther (who is a brāhmaṇa) by rebuking or beating or depriving him of wealth and the like and in whose presence and on account of whom the brahmana that is angered kills himself. The Mit. quotes a verse of Viṣnu and also another verse (without name ) on this point. If a person kills a brāhmana boy whose upanayana had not been performed he was yet regarded as guilty of brāhmana murder.40 The Samavidhāna Br. I. 7.5, Āp. Dh. S. (I.9.24.6-9), Vas.20.34, Manu XI. 87, Yaj. III. 251 held that killing even a kṣatriya or vaisya who had studied the Veda or had been initiated for a soma sacrifice rendered the killer guilty of brahmahatyā, as also the killing of the foetus (of brāhmana parents ) whose sex was unknown and of a woman who was an ātrey1.41 Killing a brāhmaṇa woman other than an ātreyi or other than the wife of a sacrificer engaged in a soma sacrifice was only an upapātaka, as Manu (XI. 66) and Yaj. (III. 236) lay down. Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 264 says that no prāyaścitta can expiate the sin of killing a woman intentionally. In the case of the three varnas other than that of brāhmana some smộtis like that of Oyavana42 laid down other mahāpātakas in addition to the five, viz. punishing one who should not be punished and fleeing from the battle-field are additional mahāpātakas for ksatriyas, employing false balances and weights for vaisyas, the selling ol flesh, injuring a brahinana, sexual intercourse with a brāhmaṇa woman, the drinking of the ____39. तथा योपि भर्सनतानपनापहारादिना परान्कोपयति सोऽपि मरणहेतुभूतमन्यू त्पावनद्वारेण हिंसाहेतुर्भवत्येव । अत एव विष्णुनोत्रम्। आक्रष्टस्ताडितो वापि धनेो विप्रयोजितः । यमुद्दिश्य त्यजेत् प्राणांस्लमाहुब्रह्मघातकम् ॥ तथा । ज्ञातिमित्रकलत्रार्थ सुहृत्क्षेत्रार्थमेव च ।

If a brāhmaṇa or any other human being or a cow died while a competent doctor was administering treatment to them by means of drugs, oils or food, or cauterization by cutting or by opening a vein the medical man incurred no sin.43 But if a quack pre tending to know medicine administered such treatment and death followed, Yāj. II. 242 prescribed various punishments. If a brāhmaṇa administers moderate corporal punishnient to his son, pupi) or wife for some fault and the son or pupil or wife suddenly dies he incurs no sin, according to the Bhavisyapurāṇa and the Agnipurāņa.44 Gautama (II. 48-50), Āp. Dh. S. I. 2. 8. 29-30, Manu VIII, 299-300 (Matsyapurāṇa 227, 152-154), Visnu Dh. 8. 71. 81-82, Nārada (abhyupetyāgusrüṣā 13-14) lay down that the punishment should be administered with a rope or bamboo slip on the back (but never on the head or chest) and Manu (VIII, 300) provides that if these restrictions were violated the punisher would incur the same guilt or punishment as a thief. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 362-363 for this topic. 

One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieval Dharmaśāstra writers is whether a man can kill a brāhmaṇa ātatāyin in self-defence without incurring any sin or punishment by the king. There is great divergence of views on this point, which has been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 148–151 and vol. III pp. 517-518. The conclusion of the Mitākṣarā appears to voice the views of most writers that, if a brāhmaṇa comes as an atatāyin (as an incendi ary, as a poisoner, as a kidnapper of women or with the inten tion of killing or wresting a field), then in self-defence one may oppose him without incurring any sin, but that if the brāhmana offender meets death though the defender did not desire to kill him (but only to stop him by causing injury short of death), the

Surāpāna (drinking of surā) has been held to be a mahā pātaka. The word surā occurs several times in the Rgveda (e. g. Rg. I. 116.7, 1. 191.10, VII. 86.6, VIII, 2.12, X. 107.9). Rg. VII. 86,6 quoted above (in note 17) clearly indicates that surā was looked upon by the Rgvedic singers as a cause of sin just as much as gambling. Rg. I. 116.7 (satam kumbhān asiñcatam surāyāḥ) read with Rg. I. 117.6 (satam...madhūnām) implies that madhu (honey or some sweet substance) might have been used in preparing surā. Soma was a beverage to be offered to the gods and to be drunk by the brāhmaṇa priests and was sharply distinguished from sură (e. g. in Tai, S. II.5. 1.1, Vāj. S. 19.7, Sat. Br. V.1.5.28). The last furnishes the striking antithesis 'soma is truth, prosperity, light; and surā is untruth, misery, darkness'. It appears that long before the Kathaka Samhitā brahmanas had come to regard the drinking of surā as very sinful [XII, 12 'therefore the brāhmana does not drink surā (with the idea) that (by drinking it) he may become affected by sin'].46 The Chāndogya Up. (V. 10.9) speaks of the drinker of surā as a patita, while in V. 11.5 king47 Ašvapati Kaikeya makes the boast before the five learned brāhmaṇas that had come to him for the knowledge of Atman Vaišvānara that in his kingdom there was no thief and no drinker of madya. Though Manu XI. 54 enumerates the drinking of surā among the five mahāpātakas, Yāj. III. 227 speaks of the madyapa (drinker of madya) as one of the five great sinners. Therefore we must explain what is meant by surā and when surāpāna becomes a mahāpātaka. By Manu XI, 93 surā is said to be the refuse of food and Manu XI. 94 states that surā is of three kinds, viz. that prepared from molasses, that from flour and that from madhūka flowers (or from honey). There is a great deal of discussion about surā in many of the digests and the propositions

Drinking of sura established by most of them are48: (1) that all the three higher varņas are forbidden to drink the sură prepared from flour and drinking it is a grave sin (mahāpātaka) in the case of anyone belonging to the three first varnas; (2) All intoxicants (madya) are forbidden to brāhmaṇas at all stages of life (Gaut. II. 25 ‘madyam nityam brāhmaṇaḥ' and Āp. Dh. 8. 1. 5. 17-21); but a brāhmaṇa drinking surā of the gaudi or mādhvi kind would not be guilty of mahāpātaka but of anupātaka (acc. to Visnu); (3) that intoxicants other than surā prepared from flour are not con demned for ksatriyas and vaisyas; (4) the sūdra was not for bidden to drink any kind of intoxicant (including sură made from flour); (5) brahmacarins of all varnas studying the Veda had to abstain from intoxicants of all kinds. The Vignu Dh. S. (22. 83-84) specifies ten kinds of madya (intoxicants) prepared from dates, jack fruit, cocoanuts, sugarcane &c. and Pulastya quoted by the Mit on Yāj. III. 253, by the Prayascittaprakarana of Bhavadeva (p. 40), the Prayascittaviveka of Śūlapāņi (p. 90), Pr. Prakāśa (folio 69 b) refers to eleven kinds of madyas apart from sura (dvādaśam to suramadyam sarveṣām adhamam smộtam). Vide H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 964-966 for further discus sion on intoxicating drinks,

The Mit, points out (on Yāj. III. 253) that the prohibition against drinking surā applies to boys who have not yet been in vested with the sacred thread and also to unmarried girls, since Manu XI. 93 makes no distinction of sex but only forbids to the three first castes the drinking of surā and since the Bhavisyapurāņa49 expressly forbids to a brāhmaṇa female the drinking of surā. The Kalpataru appears to have held otherwise. But a woman and a minor had to undergo lesser prāyaścitta as will be shown below. Vas. 21. 11 and Yāj. III, 256 state that the wife of a brāhmana, ksatriya or vaisya who drinks surā (made from flour )would not reach the worlds of her husband and she

would become in this world a bitch or a sow50. The Mit, remarkgst on this verse that though a sūdra is not forbidden to drink surā, even the sūdra wife of a brāhmaṇa should not drink sura. 

Drinking surā means taking it down the throat. Thero fore if a man's lips only touch surā or if surā enters his mouth but he spits it out, then there is no drinking of surā (i, e. no mahāpātaka) and he would have had to undergo in such a case a light expiation for the touch of surā52. 

Steya (theft). In order to constitute theft as a grave sin according to the commentaries the theft must be of a brāhmaṇa's gold of a certain quantity. Steya is defined by Ap. Dh, S. I. 10. 28. 1 as 'a man becomes a thief by coveting another's property (and taking it) in whatever situation he may be (without the owner's consent)'. Kātyāyana (810) defines54 it as 'depriving a man of his property, whether clandestinely or openly and, whether by night or by day, is known to be theft'. Vyāsa defines it similarly. Vacaspati in his bhāsya on Yogasūtra II. 30 defines steya as taking property from another in a manner that is not allowed by the śāstras (steyam aśāstra-pūrvakam dravyāņām paratah svikaranam). Though Manu (XI. 54) and Yāj. (III. 227) simply employ the word 'steya' ( theft) or 'stena' ( thief) yet in speaking of the prayascitta

Steya as Mahāpātaka

for steya Manu (XI. 99suvarnasteyakrt') and Yāj. III. 257 (brāhmanasvarnahāri) add the qualification that he should be a thief guilty of stealing gold (from a brāhmana, acc. to Yāj.). Vas, 20. 41 and Cyavana (q. by Pr. V. p. 117) mention 'brāhmana suvarna-haraṇa' as a mahāpåtaka and the Sāmavidhāna Br. (I. 6.1) also employs the words 'brāhmapasvam hrtvā'. Vide Samvarta 122 and Viśvāmitra (q. by Pr. V. p. 108). A further qualification was added by Visvarūpa (on Yāj. III. 252 'anākhyāya &c.), the Mit. (on Yāj. III. 257), the Madana pārijāta (pp. 827-28 ), Prāyaścittaprakaraṇa (p. 72), the Prayascittaviveka (p. 111) and other commentators that the gold stolen must be at least sixteen māṣas in weight, otherwise there is no mahāpātakass. So, if a man steals gold belonging to a brāhmaṇa which is less than 16 māsas or steals gold of any weight (even more than 16 māsas) from a non-brāhmana (i. e. from a kṣatriya or the like) he would be guilty only of a minor sin (upapūtaka). The Mit, relies on the verses of Yāj. I. 362-363 for the technical meaning of suvarņa (as 16 māṣas). There was no guilt of theft acc. to Vārsyāyaṇi if (Āp. Dh. S. 1. 10. 28.2) a person took only a small quantity of cereals ripening in pods (such as mudga, māṣa and gram) or took grass for his oxen while he was going (in a cart.56) According to Gautama 12.25 a man may take (without permission and without incurring the guilt of theft) for the sake of cows and for the sake of frauta or smārta fires grass, fuel and flowers of trees and plants as if they were his own property and the fruits (of trees and plants) that are not fenced around. Manu VIII, 339 (=Matsya 227. 112-113) is almost Jike Gaut. 12.25 and Manu VIII. 341 adds that a traveller of the three higher castes may, if his provisions have run short, take (without fear of punishment) from another's field two sugarcane stalks and two mülakas (esculent roots). 

Guruanganāgamaḥ (sexual intercourse with the wife of the guru). Manu (X1,54) employs this word, while Yāj. III, 227 and Vas. 20.13 speak of the offender as gurutalpaga (who violates the bed of the guru) and Vas. I. 20 mentions the sin as 'gurutal pam'

(the bed i. e. wife of the guru). Guru primarily means acc. to Manu II.142 and Yāj. I 34 (=Sankha III.2) the father. Acc. to Gautama II.56 'the teacher (of the Veda) is the foremost amongst grurus while some say that the mother is so'. Samvarta 57 160 and Parāśara X. 13 ( employing the words 'pitrdārān samāruhya') convey that the primary meaning of guru here is 'father' as stated by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 259. Acc. to many digests such as the Mit. and the Madanapārijāta p. 835 guruarigand means one's own mother. Bhavadeva in his Pr. Prakarana (p. 80) takes gurvanganā58 as a karmadhāraya compound, following what is called the niṣādasthapati-nyāya (Jai. VI. 1. 51). After quoting Devala's dictum 59 that there are eleven persons among males who are to be looked upon as gurus, and adverting to the way in which the word 'gurvangana' is explained by the Pr. Prakarana, the Prāyagcitta-viveka expresses its dissent from the views of the Pr. Prakarana and holds that 'gurvangana' or 'gurupatni' means not only one's mother but also one's step-mother of the same varna as the father. The Madanapārijāta (p. 835) holds the same view as the Pr. V. The Pr. M.p. 73 finds fault with Bhavadeva (author of Prayascitta prakarana) and also with the Pr. V. that held the view that sexual intercourse with one's Vedic teacher's wife was also a

Incest (Guru-talpagamana) mahāpātaka. The Pr. M. relies on Yāj. (III. 233) where there is an express extension of the sin of gurutalpaga mana to intercourse with one's teacher's wife, or one's daughter and other nearly related women. This would have been unnecessary if gurutal pa was primarily meant to include the teacher's wife; while the Pr. V. relies upon Gaut. II, 56 ('the ācārya is the most eminent among gurus, some say that the mother is so'), Visnu Dh. S. 31.1-2 'three persons are atigurus (exceed even guru in their greatness) viz. the mother, the father and the ācārya and Devala who mentions eleven persons as gurus. The Pr. M, does not seem to be quite correct since the Pr. V. ultimately (pp. 134-135) states its final view that guru here means only the father and not the ācārya and others and that Visnu Dh. S. 36. 4-8 holds that sexual intercourse with the wife of the teacher and several other women relatives is an anupātaka.vome 

Mahāpātaki samsarga-Association with those who are guilty of the four mahāpātakas has already been described in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 614, 944. Gaut. 21.3, Vas. I. 21-22, Manu XI. 180 ( =śāntiparva 165. 37), Yāj. III. 261, Viṣņu Dh. S. 35.3, Agnipurāņa 170. 1-2 prescribe briefly that one who closely associates or dwells with any one of the four grave sinners for one year himself incurs mahāpataka 60 and they add that this applies when a man occupies the same conveyance or same seat (as the sinner) or dines in the same row (with the sinner), but that if a person enters into spiritual relationship (such as that of teaching the Veda to the sinner or learning it from him or of officiating as a priest for him or allowing him to officiate as a priest for himself) or into a sexual or matrimonial alliance with him (i. e, a man who cohabits with a woman that is a grave sinner or if a woman cohabits with a male that is a great sinner or if a man marries the daughter of a patita or if a woman marries a bridegroom that is palita) that person becomes guilty of mahāpātaka at once.

of nine kinds of saṁsarga (contact or association) out of which the first five were treated as light sins, but the other four were serious viz. occupying the same bed or seat, taking food in the same row with the sinner, cooking food in the sinner's cooking pots or partaking of food prepared by him, being his sacrificial priest or employing him as one's sacrificial priest, being the sinner's teacher of the Veda or employing him as one's teacher of the Veda, sexual intercourse, taking food with him in the same pot. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 74a) holds that samsarga is of three kinds, the highest, middling and lowest. The first includes four viz. yonisambandha (marriage), srauva (i. e. that due to sacrificing for a sinner or making him a priest), maukcha (about learning or teaching Veda) and eating of food from the same vessel (ekāmatrabhojana); the middling is of five kinds viz, using the same vehicle, seat, bed or coverlet; eating in the same row and learning the Veda together ( sahādhyayana). The lowest is of various other kinds such as intimate talks, touching, cook ing food in the same vessel, eating food at his house, receiving a gift from him &c. Adhyāpana in order to be a great sin must relate to the Veda, and so also yājana must relate to such Vedic sacrifices as Darsapürnamāsa, Cāturmāsya, Agnistoma. Helping a mahāpātakin to perform the five daily yajñas or teaching him the angas (metrics, grammar etc.) and the śāstras is only a minor sin. Parāśara62 (XII. 79) states that sins are transferred (or spread) from man to man like a drop of oil on water by sitting or sleeping together or by using the same conveyance or by speaking with or dining in the same row. Devala and Chāgaleya q. by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 261, the Pr. Prakarana (p. 101), the Pr, V. (p. 145), the Par. M. (II. part 1. p. 28) and others contain similar verses. Acc. to Pr. Prakasa (folio 75a), in order to become patita one must simultaneously practise these four together; if practised separately, there is no pātitya but only doṣa. Parāśara (I. 25-26) states that in the Křta age a man became patita by speaking with a patita, in Tretā by touching him, in Dvāpara by partaking of food prepared in his house and in Kali by actually committing a sinful act and that in the Kịta age a district was abandoned (if any one therein became patita), in Tretā the village, in Dvāpara the family (of the patita was abandoned) and in Kali only the actual perpetrator himself (is

Samsarga (Contact) abandoned as palita). It is clear from this that such contacts with a patita as speaking with him,63 touching him or eating food (in the house of a patita) were not regarded as involving a man in the same sin as that of the actual perpetrator. Speak ing, touching and eating are also actions ( karman ) and Parāśara did not include them in the word 'karmanā' which refers only to the actual perpetration of a murder, surāpāna etc. Therefore when some writers include such contacts as eating or touching under 'karmaṇāl they put two meanings on the word karman in Parāśara viz. perpetration of a murder or the like and also doing some of the acts (touching, eating) which are forbidden to be done in reference to a perpetrator by some smrtis. This is a procedure which is against the maxim of the Mimāṁsā that the same word conveys only 64 one sense in the same context. The reasonable inference from the words of Parāśara is that merely touching a mahāpātakin or eating food in his house did not involve the toucher and eater in pātitya. In spite of this medieval writers gradually extended the scope of samsarga in a spirit of exclusiveness and of over-emphasis on ideas of ceremonial purity. For example, the Smartyarthasāra (p. 112) remarks that he who associates with the person that associates with a mahāpātakin has to undergo half the expiation that the first associator has to undergo. But that work does not go beyond this. The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 261) appears to hold that the associator even though he does not bo come patita is liable to undergo expiation and that even the 4th and 5th associators in a series are liable to undergo expiation

though it is Jesser and lesser66. The Pr. Prakarana (p. 109), Pr. V. (pp. 169-170) and the Pr. T. (p. 547) quote certain verses of Āpastamba and Vyāsa which very much widen the circle of samsarga. Apastamba-smrtion (III. 1-3) states : if a cāndāla stays in the house of any one of the four castes without being known, the latter on conting to know of the fact should undergo expiation, which is Candrāyana or Parāka for a member of the first three varnas and Prājāpatya for a südra. Those who partook of cooked food in that man's house should undergo Kịcchra; one should prescribe one half of Kịcchra for those who took cooked food in the house of the 2nd associator and for those who partook of cooked food in the house of these last one fourth of Krochra is prescribed'. So besides the original associator three more in succession were held to be liable for prayas citta. Mercifully they stopped at the 4th from the original associator. A few writers took a more reasonable view. The Par. M. (II. part 2, p. 90) remarks68 that Parāśara did not prescribe any expiation for saisarga (with those guilty of grave sins) with the idea that in the Kali age

Samsarga in Kali age

there is no blen ish of saṁsarga and that it is on account of this that in the enumeration of things to be avoided or not allowed in the Kali age (Kali-varjya) another smrti includes 'pollution through contact with a sinner' (as a Kalivarjya). The Smrtimuktāphala (Prāyaścitta pp. 897-98) echoes the very words of Madhava and quotes further authorities on the point69. The Nirdayasindhu7 holds that though there is blame in association with a patita the associator does not himself become patita. As Yāj III, 261 employs the word 'vatsaram' and as the accusative of time is, acc. to Pāṇini, to be used only when there is 'atyantasamyoga' of time and space ( distance ) it follows that the associator who is to undergo penance for contact must have been day and night in contact for a year. Devala employs the word 'sārvakālikam' in this connection, 

Though many crimes do not in so many words come within the words of the definitions of the mahāpātakas the smrtis extend by analogy the same condemnation as the mahāpātakas in three ways. For example, Yāj. III. 251 expressly states that one who kills a ksatriya or vaigya engaged in (soma) sacrifice or a foetus or an ātreyi woman has to undergo the same expiation as for brāhmana murder (therefore this is vācanikātideśa). Yāj. IIL 232-233 extends the sin of gurutalpa-gamana to intercourse with several near female relatives (such as mother's or father's sister). This is extension by tādrūpya. The smrtis declare many actions as equal to ( sama) mahāpātakas in general or as equal to one of the mahāpātakas. This is atideśa by sāmya. A few words must be said on this topic. The general rule is that the expia tion for those lapses that are declared to be equal to a mahāpātaka is less than (i. e. half of) what would be prescribed

(Vol. for the mahāpātaka itself?!. And the penance for those that come under atideśa of the vācanika or tādrūpya kind is three fourths of that for the mahāpātaka itself. But it has to be noted that there is divergence of views about these in the sūtras and the smrtis. Acc. to Gaut. 21.10 giving72 false evidence, backbiting about another's guilt that will reach the king, falsely accusing one's guru with a grave sin or crime are equal to mahāpātaka. In Manu XI.55 (= Agnipurāņa 168. 25) the last two of these three and false statement about one's caste or learning or family (i. e. saying that one is a brāhmana when one is not) for securing pro sperity or eminence are stated to be equal to brāhmaṇa's murder. Acc. to Yāj. III. 228 falsely charging one's guru is equal to brahmahatyā and false statement about one's caste or learning is equal to drinking surā (Yāj. III. 229), while acc. to Visnu Dh. S. 37.1-3 the three sins mentioned in Manu XI. 55 are to be in cluded among minor sins (upapātakas), while giving false evid ence is declared by Visnu to be equal to drinking surā ( 36.2). No useful purpose would be served by dilating at great length on the divergences of smrtis on what lapses are equal to one of the Mahāpātakas. The digests explain that where the same lapse is described as equal to surāpāna by one smrti and as equal to brāhmana-murder by another the idea is that there is an option as to the penance prescribed for that lapse. There fore only the remarks of Manu and Yaj. will be set out here. Manu XI. 56 ( = Agnipurāṇa 168, 26 ) prescribes that forgetting the Veda (already studied ), reviling the Vedas, giving false evidence, killing a friend, eating forbidden food or food that should not be eaten, these six are equal to surāpāna. Vide Yāj. III. 228 already referred to above. Manu XI. 57 holds that stealing a deposit or a man or horse or silver or land or diamonds and other gems is equal to the theft of brāhmana's gold. Yāj. III. 230, Visnu Dh. S. 5. 383, Agni purāṇa 168.27 are to the same effect. Acc. to Manu XI. 58 (= Agnipurāṇa 168. 28) carnal intercourse with a sister by the same mother, with maidens, with females of the lowest castes (like Candālas), with the wife of a friend or son is declared to

Extension to sins by analogy be equal to the violation of a guru's bed. Yāj. III, 231 is practically the same (but he adds intercourse with a sagotra woman to the list). Gaut. 23. 12 and Manu XI. 170 are very similar. Yāj. III, 232-233 declare that a man who has sexual intercourse with a sister of his father or mother, with his maternal uncle's wife, with his daughter-in-law, with a co-wife of his mother, with his sister, with the daughter or wife of his Vedic teacher or his own daughter, is guilty of being a violator of the guru's bed and should have his penis cut off and be killed (by the king) and the woman concerned, if she was a willing party, should also be killed. Nārada (stripumsayoga, verses 73-75)73 states: "If a man has sexual intercourse with any of these women viz. mother, mother's sister, mother-in-law, maternal uncle's wife, father's sister, a wife of the paternal uncle or of a friend or of a pupil, a sister, sister's friend, daughter-in-law, daughter, the wife of one's Vedic teacher, a woman of the same gotra, one who has come for protection, a queen, an ascetic woman, one's wet-nurse, a woman performing a vrata and a brāhmaṇa woman, he becomes guilty of the sin of the violator of the guru's bed (i. e. incest). For that crime no other punishment is laid down except that of the cutting of the penis." These two, Yaj. and Nārada, show that excision of the organ and death are both the expiation and the punishment for this crime. The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 233) adds that this punish ment applies only to the offenders other than a brāhmana, since Manu (VIII, 380) prescribes that a brāhmana offender should not be punished with death whatever sin or crime he may have committed and that he is to be banished from the country unhurt and is to retain all his wealth. The Viṣnudharma-sūtra (36 4-7) adds a few more women to the list of Yaj. and Nārada (such as a woman in her monthly illness, the wife of a learned brāhmaṇa or of one's sacrificial priest or of one's Upādhyāya). 

These lapses described above from false accusation against the guru74 (Yaj. III, 228 or Manu XI. 55 to Yaj. III. 233 or Manu

XI. 58) and said to be equal to some mahāpātaka or other are designated as pātakas by Vrddha-Hārīta (IX. 216-17) and by the Mit. (on Yāj. III 233) and as anupūtakas by the Visņudharma sūtra (36.8). Gautama75 (21.1-2) adds a few more to the list of pātakas or patitas viz. he who has connection with the female relatives of his mother or father or with sisters and their offspring, a thief of gold, an atheist, one who constantly rapeats censured acts, one who does not cast away a patita or who abandons blameless relatives or those who instigate others to commit pātakas. These pātakas are less than mahāpātakas in their culpability and greater than upapātakas. 

Upapātakas (minor sins). The number of these has greatly varied from time to time and from smrti to smrti. Vas. I. 23 speaks76 of only five upapātakas viz. forsaking the sacred fires (after beginning Agnihotra), offending the guru, being an atheist, taking one's livelihood from an atheist, selling the soma plant. Šātātapa as quoted by Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 229-236 mentions only eight. Baud. Dh, S. (II. 1.60-61) mentions a small number as upapātakas. Gaut. 21.11 states that the guilt of upapātaka attaches to those who have been declared to defile the company at a Srāddha dinner and have been named above before the bald man (in Gaut. XV. 18), killers of kine, those who forget the Veda, those who pronounce Vedic texts for these last, Vedic students who break the vow of chastity and those who allow the time for upanayana to pass without performing it. Sankha quoted by Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 229-236 mentions only 18 upapātakas and styles them upapataniyas. The longest lists are contained in Manu XI. 59-66, Yāj. III. 234-242, Vrddha-Hārīta IX. 208-210, Visnudharmasūtra 37 and Agnipurāṇa (168. 29-37). A.c cording to the Pr. V. (p.195)78 the upapātakas mentioned by Manu

X. 117.6 and Manu III. 118); sexual intercourse with a woman (even one's own wife) who is given to drinking wine; giving up the Veda already learnt so as to forget it by the study of other subjects ); not tending one's srauta or smārta fire; abandoning one's son82; not maintaining one's relatives (such as the maternal or pater nal uncle, when one has the means) ; cutting down a big tree for fuel (to be used only in cooking one's food 83): maintaining one's self on one's wife (i. e, on her immoral earnings or by means of her strīdhana) or by killing animals or by herbs (used as charms); setting up of machines that cause death or injury to beings (such as for pressing oil from sesame or for crushing sugarcane stalks); addiction to the vices (declared to be eighteen by Manu VII. 45-48); selling one's self (as a slave for money); being the servant of a sūdra; friendship with low persons; intercourse with a woman of a lower caste (either as a wife or as a concubine); living outside of the four āśramas 81; fattening oneself on food charitably supplied by others; studying the works of false sāstras (such as those of atheists like Cārvāka); holding the office of the superintendent of mines (of gold and the like); sale of one's wife.

List of upapātakas 

35 

The above list, though long, is not thoroughly exhaustive Vas. I. 18 quoted above mentions several persons as enasvinah ( who acc. to Visvarūpa on Yāj. III. 229-236 are upapātakinah), some of whom (such as one who is asleep when the sun rises or sets) are not included by Yāj. in his list of upapātakas. Though almost all of the upapātakas listed by Yāj. occur in Manu (XI, 59-66 ), yet some of them such as abhicāra' (per forming a sacrifice like Syenayāga for the destruction of an enemy), mūJakarma' (employment of herbs for bringing under one's control a person) are not noted by Yāj. The Mit. on Yāj. III, 242 observes that some upapatakas if repeatedly indulged in make a man patita (as provided by Gaut. 21.1). Visvarūpa, there fore, derives upapātaka as one that may become a pātaka by constant addition (upacaya) or by constant practice' (upetya85). 

Manu XI. 67 (=Agnipurāņa 16886, 37-38) and Vispu Dh. S. 38. 1-6 mention certain lapses as 'jātibhramgakara' ( that cause the loss of caste ) viz. giving pain to a brāhmana (by means of a stick or by the hand ), smelling things which ought not to be smelt at (such as garlic, ordure &c.) and smelling spirituous liquor, cheating (saying one thing and doing another), an unnatural offence with a man or beast also, acc. to Visnu). According to Manu XI. 68 (= Agnipurāņa 168. 38-39), killing a donkey, a horse, a camel, a deer, an elephant, a goat, sheep, fish, a snake or a buffalo must be known to be sankarikarana (reducing one to a mixed caste). Visnu 29. 1 says that sankarikarana is the killing of village or forest animals. Manu XI. 69 holds that accepting presents from condemned men (such as those mentioned in Manu IV. 84), trading, serving sūdras and speaking a falsehood make a man unworthy to receive gifts (apatrikarana). The Viṣnu. Dh. S. 40. 1. adds 'maintaining one's self by usury' to these. Manu XI. 70 prescribes that killing insects, small or large, or birds, eating any thing kept close to spirituous liquors, stealing fruits, fuel and flowers and unsteadiness of mind are malāvaha (which make a man impure). Visnu Dh. S. 41.1-4 are similar. Visnu Dh. S. 42. 1 says all other lapses not specifically mentioned in

the several kinds are styled miscellaneous (prakirņaka). Vrddha Hārīta (IX, 210-215) specifies several lapses as prakirnaka viz. cutting big trees for fuel (used for cooking one's food); killing insects, big and small; eating of food that has become uneatable owing to bhāva 87 (i. e. its resemblance in colour or flavour to some forbidden food or because it is offered with disrespect) or kāla (food on ekādaśī or in an eclipse, or in a mourner's house &c. or that is stale) or kriya (action, such as food served with the bare hand or seen by a patita, cāndala or a dog &c.); theft of clay, skin, grass, wood; over-eating; falsehood; Testlessness about pleasures; sleep by day; spreading false rumours; making others hear false rumours; eating at another's house; sexual intercourse by day; seeing women in their monthly illness or just after delivery; looking at others' wives; sexual intercourse on a fast. on a śrāddha day, on a parvan day; service of a sūdra; friend ship with the low; touching the leavings of food; broad laughs with women; talking at random (or Jove prattle); looking at women that have untied their hair. It will be noticed that some of these like the cutting of big trees for fuel, service of a sūdra, friendship with low persons have been already in cluded by Yāj. under upapātakas. 

Having dealt at length with several classes or grades of sins, we have now to address ourselves to the question of the consequences of sins and the means recommended or adopted for removing sin and its consequences. 

It has already been shown above how the sages of the Rgveda prayed to the gods, particularly to Aditi, Mitra, Varuna, the Adityas and Agni to free them from ūgas or enas etc. They often say that they violated the dharmas or the vratas (ordinances) of the gods and implore forgiveness. They were afraid of the consequences of their guilt, viz. the god's anger. They thought that when God was angered by their transgres sions he smote them with adversity, destruction, disease and death. For example, they prey: 'whatever ordinance (vrata) of yours we may violate every day like subjects (in the case of a king's ordinances) do not subject us to your death-dealing blow' (Rg. I. 25.2); 'O Varuna! whatever transgression we men have committed towards the divine host and whatever rules of yours we may have confounded through heedlessness, do not, on

Fear of conséquences of sin account of that sin (enas), strike us down' (Rg. VII, 89.5)88. In Rg. X. 89.8-9 it is said that Indra hurls his sharp and deadly weapon at those who break the settled order (dharman) of Mitra, Varuna and Aryaman. The gods are implored to save the worshipper from the deadly attacks of the wolf and from sinking into a pit (in adversity) in Rg. II. 29.6. In Rg. IX. 73,8 it is said that the wise God has his eye on all worlds and he pierces in pits those who do not observe his ordinances and who are therefore not liked by him89. On the other hand, when God is pleased with the worshipper, he is implored to lead the latter by the path of virtue (Rg. I. 189.1), to confer happiness on the wor shipper's offspring (Rg. I. 189,2,IV.12,5) and to bestow wealth on him (Rg. VIII, 45.40). 

In the Rgveda the first means of removing the consequences of sin appear to be prayers for mercy and for the remission of sin as in Rg. VII. 86. 4-5, VII. 88, 6-7, VII, 89.1-4 (where ‘mrlā suksatra mrlaya' is the refrain of all four verses). Even in the Rgveda water was supposed to remove sin, e. g. I. 23. 22 says 'O water! carry away whatever sin (durita)may exist in me'. This shows that sin was supposed to have physical effects like a disease, which were removed by water, Sacrifices were offered to the gods in order to win their favour and in order that the sacrificer may be freedoo from the consequences of even grave sins. The Tai. S. V. 3.12 1-2 and the Sat. Br. XIII, 3.1.1 (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 328) state that the gods redeemed themselves from all sin by means of this ( Aśvamedha sacrifice), they even redeemed themselves from the sin of brāhmaṇa murder. That a confession of sin was deemed to remove sin is illustrated in a striking way by what happened in the Varuņapraghāsa (one of the cãturmāsya sacrifices). In that'l sacrifice the wife of the sacrificer had to confess whether she had any lovers and if she felt ashamed to

reply in so many words she had only to raise up in her hand small pieces of grass blades to indicate the number of lovers, if any. If she confessed she had to recite the verse, Vaj. S. III. 44 and was allowed to take further part in the sacrifice. If she con cealed the truth, it was stated in the Tai. Br. that evil would be fall her near and dear relatives (her son or husband). It is said by many European scholars who have written on the religion of the Veda that sacrifice became a sort of magic rite to wrest from gods or independently of them what the worshipper desired (e.g. see Keith's Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads pp. 260-268).92 But this is an over-statement. When initiated for a sacrifice the sacrificer and his wife had to observe a fast or live on a low diet, both were called upon to observe many strict rules such as telling the truth, they had to make large preparations and spend wealth on the materials and the fees to the priests. These things were deemed to cleanse the mind and soul of the taint of sin. There is no reason to suppose that it was only the ritual that was thought to bring about the desired result (and not all the other matters referred to above). 

We shall now discuss the prescriptions of the sutras and smrtis about the consequences of sins. 

In this connection the doctrines of Karma and Punarjanma must be well remembered. The details of the origin and develop ment of those doctrines will be discussed in a later section, Here it is enough to state the few main propositions of the doctrine of Karma. The fundamental proposition is that cause and effect areas inseparably linked in the moral sphere as assumed in the physical sphere by science. A good action has its reward and a bad act leads to retribution. If the bad actions do not yield their consequences at once or in this life, the soul begins another existence and in the new environment undergoes suffering for its past bad deeds. The theory of karma and 

92. Christ gave a model prayer to his disciples in Luke 11. 2-4 and Matthew 6. 9-13, where after invoking the heavenly Father the first thing asked for is the daily bread, then the forgiveness of sin and deliverance from evil. Pious Christians have an easy and complacent self-assurance of getting the things prayed for, since Cbrist himself has said that they have only to ask and it shall be given to them (Luke 11.9). This also is a sort of magic but it is simple as compared with elaborate Indian sacrifices. It seems rather perverse for a Christian who believes in Luke 11.9 to Day Thai if an Indian believes that a sacrifice will yield some reward it is all magic and nothing more,

the theory of transmigration of souls (of pre-existence and post-existence) are inextricably mixed up in Indian thought from at least the ancient times of the Upanisads. The general rule is that Karma, whether good or evil, cannot be got rid of, except by enjoying or undergoing its consequences. This is said by Gaut. 19. 5, Mārkandeya-purāņa and many other works. 'Because the deed does not perish' Gaut. 93, 'whatever human action it may be, whether good or evil, it cannot be got rid of except by enjoying its consequences; know from me that a man gets rid of good and evil deeds by enjoying (their con sequences)'. This doctrine is based on the Sat. Br. 7.2.2.27, Br. Up. IV. 4 and VI. 2, Chān. Up. III. 14, and V. 3-10, Katha 5, 6-7 and other Upaniṣad texts. 

Therefore they say, 'a man is born again in that world for which he has worked.' 'According as a man acts and accord ing as he believes so will he be; a man of meritorious acts will be meritorious, a man of evil deeds sinful. He becomes pure by pure deeds and evil by evil deeds. And here they say that a person consists of desires. And as is his desire, so is his will ; and as is his will, so is his deed; and whatever deeds he does that he will reap' (Br. Up. IV. 4. 5); 'a man is made up of will; whatever he wills in this world the same he becomes after departing from this world' (Chān. Up. III. 14. 1); 'some human beings enter the womb in order to have an embodied existence: others go into inorganic matter (the stump of a tree and the like) according to their deeds and according to their knowledge' (Katha Up. 5. 7). 94 

Actions done by a man do not perish unless they (i. e, their consequences) are enjoyed even after crores of years; (the fruits of) actions whether good or evil must of necessity be enjoyed95,

just as a calf finds out its own mother from among thousands of cows, so actions done in a former life unerringly reach the perpetrator thereof. 

But this general principle was modified in various ways by the smrtis and later writings. Gautama 19.1196 (=Vasistha 22.8) states: 'Reciting the Veda inaudibly (japa), austerities, a sacrifice, fasting and giving gifts are the means of expiating that (i.e. a blamable act).' Vas. 20. 47 and 25.3 lay down ‘A. sinner is freed from sin by tormenting his body, by austerities, by reciting the Veda and also by making gifts' and 'those who are constant ly engaged in prānāyāmas (suppression and regulation of breath), reciting purificatory texts, giving gifts, offering sacrifices, muttering sacred texts will undoubtedly be freed from sins'. Manu III. 227 observes: 'by confession, by repentance, by austerity, by reciting Vedic texts (sacred Gāyatri or other texts), a sinner is freed from guilt and in case of difficulty (i. e. if he is unable to perform austerities or to recite Vedic texts) by liberality'. Similar provisions occur in Parāsara X. 40, Śatātapa T. 4, Saṁvarta 203, Harita (q, in Pr. T. p. 467), Yama, (q, in Pr. V. pp. 30, 31 ), Bhavisyapurāņa (q. by Pr. V. p. 31.) 

Before proceeding with the subject of prāyaścittas we shall speak briefly about the other means of reducing the con sequences of sin. And first comes confession. With reference to the confession of paramours by the wife in the Varunapraghāsa, the Tai. Br. (I. 6.5. 2 )97 says 'He makes the wife confess, there by he renders her pure and then he leads her to penance'. The Sat. Br. (II. 5. 2. 20) puts it in this form for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes truth'. This was a confession before God (Fire) and men (the priests ) to restore one to divine forgiveness and favour. As regards several lapses, confession was part of the procedure prescribed for atoning for the sin.

CHAPTER II 

MEANS OF REDUCING CONSEQUENCES OF SINS 

Confession-In Ap. Dh, S. I. 9. 24. 15, 1. 10. 28, 19, 1. 10.29.1 it is prescribed that the person undergoing a penance for being an abhišasta or for unjustly forsaking his wife or for the murder of a learned brāhmaṇa has to declare his misdeed while begging for alms to support himself. The Vedic student who was guilty of sexual intercourse had also to proclaim his lapse while begging at seven houses (Gaut, 23.18, Manu XI. 122 ).98 

Repentance (anutūpa)-Manu99 XI. 229-230 (=Vispudharm oftara II. 73.231-32 ) provide: "The more a man's mind loathes his own evil deed the more does his body become freed from the unrighteousness (committed by him). If after committing a sin a man feels repentance for having done it he becomes free from that sin. He becomes purified only by the resolution of ceasing to sin and thinking 'I shall not do so again". 100 The Visnupurāṇa II. 6.40 lays emphasis on repentance and humble devotion to Krspa. Pr. V. (p. 30 ) quotes a verse of Angiras "A man after committing sins, if he is consumed by repentance and is sorry day and night (for his misdeed), is purified by prānāyāma'. The view of digests like the Pr. Prakasa is that 

98. Confession of sins has played a prominent part in early and medie val Christianity. For example, (First epistle of) John I. 9 says 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'. 

99. Manu XI. 229 also occurs in tro 218. 5. 

100. Compare Christ's call to repentance in Matthew 4. 17 and Mark I. 15 and his last words (in Luke 24. 47) that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations'.

repentance by itself is not enough to destroy sins, but that repentance renders the sinners fit to receive penance, just as paring the nails and the like make the person intending to perform a Vedic sacrifice fit to be a dikṣita. Yama quoted by Aparārka (p. 1231) states that repentance and stopping from repeating the sin are merely the angas ( subsidiary elements) of prāyaścittas and cannot independently take the place of penances, 

Prāņāyāma (restraint of the breath). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 317 for a description of this. Manu XI. 248 (which is the same as Baud. Dh. S. IV, 1.31, Vas, 26.4, Atri II. 5, Sankhasmrti XII.18-19 ) lays down: sixteen prāņāyāmas attended by the Vyāhrtis and the Pranava (omkāra), if per formed every day, would purify after a month even the murderer of a bhrūna (a learned brāhmana). Visnu Dh. S. 55.2 (in prose) is to the same effect. Vas. 26.1-3 provide that on the proper performance of three prānāyāmas all the sins committed by day or in the night are at once destroyed. Yāj. III. 305 statas that for the removal of all sins, of upapātakas and of sins for which no special expiation is provided by the texts one hundred prānāyāmas should be performed. This refers to sins not known to others for which expiation is to be performed secretly. Baud. Dh. S. (IV.1,5-11) provides for varying numbers (3, 7, 12 ) of prāņāyāmas to be spread over one day to a year for different kinds of sins ranging from the eating of the food of a südra to brāhmana murder. This whole passage is. quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III,305 which points out the kinds of sins it deals with. The Agnipurāṇa 173.21 has the same half verse as Yaj. III.305 (first half ). 

Tapas (austerity). Even Rg. X. 154. 2 speaks of tapas as leading to heaven and as unassailable. The Chăn. Up. V. 10. 1-2, Mundaka Up. I. 2. 10-11 place tapas over yajña. Gaut. 19.15 says that celibacy, 101 truthfulness, bathing thrice daily in the morning, at noon and in the evening), wearing wet clothes (till they are dried on the body), sleeping on the ground (on a raised part or altar) and fasting constitute austerities. Baud. Dh, S. III. 10.13 adds to these 'ahimsā' (non-injury to any being), astainya (not depriving any one of his property) and puru. sugrūṣa (attendance upon a teacher). Gaut. 19. 17 sates that

Tapas (austerities ) 

the periods for which tapas is to be observed are a year, six months, four months, three months, two months, one (month), 24 days, 12 days, 6 days, 3 days, a day and a night (according to the nature of the sin). Manu XI. 239-241 declare that those guilty of mahāpatakas and others guilty of evil deeds are freed from sins by well-practised tapas and that whatever sins are committed by people in thought, word and bodily actions are all quickly burnt by tapas. This doctrine is shared by th Jainas as stated in the Uttaradhyayana XXIX. 27 by austerities he cuts off karman' (S B. E, vol. 45 p. 166). 

Homa (sacrifice into fire). The Tai. A. (II, 7-8) describes 102 the küsmānda homa and diksa and II. 8 prescribes that the man who regards himself as impure should offer a sacrifice with the kūsmanda mantras (mentioned in Tai. A. II. 3-6, viz 'yaddevā deva-hedanam' (Vaj. S. 20.14-16=Tai. A. II. 3.1). The Mahārnava karmavipaka (folio 8 a) prescribes the procedure of Kūsmānda homa taken from Jamadagni which is brief. It is as follows: After shaving the hair on the head and the moustache and taking a bath in holy water one should offer the ajyabhāgas and then offer oblations of clarified butter with the three Anuvākas beginning with 'yad devā devahedanam,' and then he worships fire with the verses beginning with 'Vaisvānarāya pratipā. dayāni.' He then offers samidh with the mantra 'yadadiya. yam' and then he repeats the Jayā mantras. He has to observe the rules for a dikṣita viz. not eating flesh, avoiding sexual intercourse, not telling a falsehood and not sleeping on a cot. He has to subsist on milk (if he is a brāhmana), on barley gruel if a ksatriya and on āmiksā if he is a vaisya. The Kuṣmāņda-homa as prescribed by Baudhāyana is a longer one. The Baud, Dh. S. III. 7,1 prescribes that he who considers himself impure should offer burnt oblations reciting the kūṣmānda mantras, that he who has had forbidden intercourse becomes even like a thief or evən like a slayer of a learned brāhmaṇa

and that (by performing homa with kūsmāndas) he becomes free from any sin that is less than the murder of a learned brāhmaṇa. Yāj. III. 309 provides that whenever a twice-born man feels himself mixed up in heavy sins he should perform a homa with sesame with the sacred Gāyatri mantra. The Mit. following a verse of Yama says that one lakh of offerings of sesame must be made. Both Manu. XI. 34 and Vas. 26. 16 say that a brāhmana becomes free from all distrasses by Vedic recitations (japa) and sacrifices (homa). When the wife con fessed to the existence of a paramour, the Sat. Br. II. 5. 2. 20 states that she made an offering into the Dakṣiņāgni with the mantra (Vaj. S. IIT. 45) 'whatever103 sin we have committed, whether in the village, in the forest, in society or by the organs of sense, we cast that away by this sacrifice, svāhā.' Both Manu (VIII. 105) and Yāj. (II, 83) prescribe that when a witness tells a falsehood in order to prevent an accused person from be ing sentenced to death, he should offer for expiating his perjury an oblation of boiled rice to Sarasvati. There are other homas also prescribed such as the Ganahoma, in which such verses as 'agne naya supathā' from the Taittiriya sākhā are recited (Mahārnava). 

The old idea of sacrifice seems to have been that it was propitiatory in character. Sacrifice was not demanded or required by God. Sacrifice was probably regarded as a gift which pleased God, induced Him to forgive a man for his transgressions and enabled erring man to regain God's favour which had been lost by some shortcoming or some sinful act. Sacrifices therefore had an expiatory or cleansing function or character. Sacrifices may be performd by offerings either an animal (meant as substitute for the sinner himself who had forfeited his life for his sins and transgressions) or a burnt offering or any other thing offered to God and then distri buted to others. 

Japa (muttering of Vedic passages as prayers). Japa is of three kinds, vācika (audibly uttered), upārsu (inaudibly uttered) and mānasa (mentally revolved), each succeeding one being ten times superior, acc. to Laghu Hārīta IV, 186,

Japa (repeating Vedic prayers) (Jivananda I.).104 Śabara (on Jai. XII, 4.1) distinguishes japa from stuti, the former being simply an utterance or recitation of a mantra or mantras105. Inaudible japa is praised106 in Sānkhāyana Br. 14. 1. The Āśv. Śr I. 1. 20 provides that japa, anumantrana, āpyāyana and upasthāna are uttered upāṁsu. The Āp. Śr. (24. 1. 8-10 ) provides that mantras from the Rgveda and the Samaveda are uttered in sacrifices loudly and that passages of the Yajurveda are muttered upamśu and the Tai. Pratisakhya23.6 states that upāmsu recitation is made by means of the effort of speech organs but without sound (i.e. in a very low voice) and without the mind being directed (to utterance with udātta and other accents) i. e. 'Karanavad asabdam-amanah-prayogam-upamsu'. Gaut. 19.12(= Baud. Dh. S. III. 10. 10 =Vas.22.9) prescribes the following Vedic texts as purifiers: Upanisads, Vedanta texts, the Samhita texts of all the Vedas (and not the padapātha or kramapātha), the Yajus texts in which the word 'madhu' occurs, the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg.

original idea of japa was highly spiritual. Deep knowledge of the Upaniṣads and other texts would have made the soul pure and enabled it to realize the supreme reality and induced in the mind love of all human beings as sparks of the one Divine Essence. Japa at the highest level was contemplation of God and endeavour to attain unity with God. The habit of repeat ing the sacred texts should lead to maintaining the soul in the presence and thought of God. Japa demands three things, purity of heart, detachment and placing oneself in the hands of God.

Manu II. 85-87 (which are the same as Vas, 26. 9-11 and Visnu Dh. S. 55. 10-21) lay108 down: 'the performance of japa is ten times more efficacious than the sacrifices (like Darsapürna māsa) prescribed by the rules (of the Veda), japa when carried on inaudibly is a hundred times superior (to sacrifices) and mental revolution of mantras is a thousand times superior. The four pākayajñas 109 (Vaišvadeva, bali, daily Śrūddha, and hono uring gueste) together with the Vedic sacrifices do not come up to even the 16th part of japa. A brāhmana attains perfection (the highest goal) by japa; he may or may not engage in other duties (such as Vedic sacrifices); a brāhmaṇa befriends all creatures'. Great eulogy is bestowed on the inaudible japa of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III, 62,10) for which pp. 303-305 of H. of Dh, vol. II may be consulted. Where no particular number is specially mentioned the recitation of a mantra is to be per formed a hundred times. 110 

Manu1104 XI. 261-262, Vas. 27.1-3, Angiras 101 and other works go so far as to assert that the fire of Veda study con sumes guilt caused by evil deeds just as a fire burning strongly eonsumes even green trees or that a brahmana who remembers Rgveda (studied by him) is not tainted by any guilt, though he may have destroyed the three worlds and have eaten the food of any person whatever. But these are simply laudatory(arthavadas) and are not to be taken literally, as Vas, 27, 4 111 (=Angiras 102) gives the warning 'one should not become addicted to (or take pleasure in committing) evil deeds relying on the power of the Veda (stated in some smrti passages). The effects of) actions done through ignorance and negligence are alone consumed (by Veda study) and not those of other actions (intentionally done).'

IJI. 302-305, prescribe several Vedic hymns or single Vedic verses or prose passages as specially efficacious for removing all sins. It is not possible nor necessary to set down all of them, but by way of sample the verses of Manu (XI. 249-257) are translated here. *Even a drinker of surā becomes pure if he mutters the hymn (seen) by Kutsa 113, the three verses beginning with 'prati" (Rg. VII 80. 1-3) seen by Vasistha, the Māhitra hymn (Rg. X. 185), the verses called Suddhavatis (Rg. VIII, 95.7-9 where the word 

suddha' occurs 13 times in different connections). Even he who has stolen gold (of a brāhmana) instantly tecomes free from guilt if he once mutters (the hymn) beginning with 'asya vāmasya' i. e. Rg. I. 164. 1-52), and the Sivasankalpa (Vāj. S. XXXIV. 1-6). The violater of a guru's bed is freed from sin if he repeatedly recites the hymn beginning with 'havispāntam' (Rg. X. 88. 1-19 ) and the hymn beginning with 'na tam-amho (i. e. Rg. X. 126.1-8), the hymn beginning with 'iti' (i. e. Rg. X. 119) and the hymn addressed to Puruṣa (Rg. X. 90). He who desires to do away with sins, great and small, should mutter during a year the verse beginning with 'ava' (i. e. 'ava te helo varuna namobhih' Rg. I. 24. 14, Tai. S. I. 5. 11. 3), or the vərse ‘yat kim ca' (Rg. VII, 89. 5) or the verse 'iti vā' (Rg. X 119. 1). That man who, having accepted a gift that ought not to. be accepted, or having eatən forbidden food, mutters the hymn beginning with 'tarat sa mandi' (Rg. IX. 58.1-4)114 becomes pure after three days. He who has committed many sins becomes pure if he recites for a month the hymn beginning with 'Somā rudra' (Rg. VI. 74. 1-4) and the three verses beginning with 

Aryamanam' (Rg. IV.2.4-6) while he bathes in a river (and not in a pond or other reservoir of water). One guilty of a grioyous offence should mutter the seven verses beginning with 'Indram' (Rg. I. 106. 1-7). A twice-born man removes even very great guilt by offering clarified butter for a year (in fire) with the mantras for the Sakalahomas (Vāj.S. VIII. 13) or by muttering the

mantra 'nama id-ugram' (Rg. VI. 51. 8). One who is stained by mortal sin becomes pure if with a concentrated mind he attends cows for a year, reciting the Pāvanāni hymns (the whole of Rg. IX) and subsisting on alms. 114a 

So much importance and such occult powers came to be attached to the words of the Rgveda that the Rgvidhāna of Saunaka (which is later than Manu) concerns itself with prescribing numerous hymns of the Rgveda for the removal of various diseases, of sins, for the conquest of enemies. 

The Sāma. Br. I. 5. 2 says 115 generally that when no parti cular hymns are prescribed for the removal of sins Vedic mantras are powerful and become purifiers if accompanied by tapas and the Sāmans may be repeated for the same purpose from ten times as the minimum to 100 times as prāyagcitta, Gautama 19. 13 prescribes the kind of food on which one should subsist when one is engaged in japa viz, one was to live on milk alone, to eat vegetables only, to eat fruits only, to live on barley gruel prepared from a handful of grain, to eat gold116, to eat clarified butter, and to drink soma and so forth. Gautama 19. 14 further lays down that all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (reis). cowpans and temples of the gods are places (which help to destroy sin). 

As the Veda could be studied in and after the sutra period only by the male members of the first three classes, the japa of Vedic texts for the removal of sins was not possible for südras; therefore, the Mit. (on Yāj. III. 262) says that although the südra (and women and those born of pratiloma marriages also) has no adhikāra (power or capacity or authority) for the recitation of Gāyatri and other Vedic mantras, still the sūdra and women after revolving in the mind the name of the deity put in the dative case can engage in japa with the word namah (i. e. he can only utter the words 'namo namah' and not om &c)

as stated by Gaut. Dh. S. X. 66-67 and Yāj. I. 121117. When Manu IV. 80 says 'let him not explain to a südra the sacred law (dharma) nor imposé upon him a vrata' all that is meant is, according to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 262, that it applies only to a sūdra who does not wait upon or serve higher varpas. Similarly, when Gaut. IV. 20 says that those born in the inverse order are outside the pale of the sacred law, the meaning is that samskāras like upanayana are not to be performed on them. The mystic syllable 'om' is said by Ap. Dh. S. (I. 4. 13. 6) to be the door to heaven and was to be employed before the recitation of any Vedic passage. The Yogasūtra (I. 27) avers that om (called pranava) is expressive of the idea of God and that the repetition of om and revolving the meaning of it in the mind lead to concentration.118 

Not only were certain Vedic hymns and passages recom mended for recitation with the object of removing sins some works, particularly the Purānas, proposed an easy way for all viz. that the remembrance of God Nārāyana (or Hari or Krsna) removed all sins. The Brahmapurāņa (chap. 176) contains a stotra (hymn of praise) of Visnu, which when recited is said to free a man from all sins (mental, vocal or bodily). The Pr. V. p. 31 quotes a verse from the Bhavisyapuranal18a and three verses from the Viṣnupurāṇa as follows:even a great sin is removed by the resolve of) not doing it again, by gifts, by confessing it to others, and by meditation (on Visnu) and not only by prāyaścittas' (Bhavisya); 'of all the expiations (for sins declared by the sages) such as tapas (Candrāyana and others ) and other actions (japa, homa, gifts ) the meditation on

Taking the name of Hari Krsna is the highest. If a man remembers Nārāyana in the morning, at night, at twilight, at midday and the like, he at once secures the removal of sin' (Visnupurāṇa). The Brahma purāṇa119 (216. 87-88) gives expression to a popular belief as follows:"Men, even after committing sins many times through folly, do not go to Hell if they prostrate themselves before Hari who destroys all sins. Those men also who always remember Janārdana eyen by roguery go to the world of Visnu after death." The Visnupurāṇa affirms that those who contemplate upon the mantra of twelve letters (viz. 'om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya') do not return to the cycle of births and deaths. The great power of mantras is mentioned in the Adiparva (161. 14) by Kunti. The Nrsimha-purāṇa in chap.18 eulogises the mantra of eight letters (om namo Nārāyanāya) and chap. 63.6. states "what is the use of many mantras and the performance of many vratas, when the mantra 'om namo Nārāyanāya' is capable of securing all desired objects". The mantra of five letters 'namah Sivaya' is dealt with in Lingapurana (pürvārdha, chap. 85) and Saura purāṇa 65. Brahma-purāṇa speaks of vaidika mantras and āgamolta mantras (41. 63). The Nityācāra-paddhati (p. 67) says that it is necessary to understand the meaning of Vedic mantras in srauta rites but in smārta rites it is not so. 

Dāna (gifts). Gaut. XIX. 16 provides120 that gold, a cow, a dress, a horse, land, sesamum, clarified butter and food are the gifts (that destroy sin) and may be optionally undergone as penance if no express mention is made thereof. Vas, quotes several verses on gifts one of which (29. 16) states: "whatever sin a man distressed for livelihood commits he is purified from that by giving land even if it be as small in extent as 'gocarma' "121Visnu Dh. S. 92.4 is to the same effect. Sam varta122 (204) prescribes that the gifts of gold, cow and land

quickly destroy sins even if committed in former lives. Medha tithi (on Manu XI. 139) remarks that the verse implies that as to sins arising from injury to living beings gifts are the princi pal expiations. The subject of dāna has been dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 837-888. A few further remarks may be made here. In many inscriptions and copperplate grants of lands or villages the donor usually states that the grant is made for the increase of the merit of himself and of his parents (e. g. E. I. vol. XI, p. 219 at p. 221). Bphaspati123 as quoted in the Madanaratna (vyavahāra p. 66) expressly provides that in land-grants the king should state that he made the gift for securing merit to his parents and to himself124. The Rājatarangiņi (I. 143 ) 125 refers to the founding of vihāras (monasteries). 

Upavāsa (fasting ). Fasting strictly means total abstin ence from food and drink, but generally it means light diet restricted in quantity and also as regards the nature of the articles taken. Even the Tai. S. (I. 6. 7. 3-4) refers126 to three ways of observing vrata on the days of the Darsapūrnamāsa-iṣti either by subsisting only on food available in the village or on forest food or partaking of no food at all. Gaut. 19.11 includes upavāsa among the several means of removing sins. Tapas is also one of such means acc. to him. But in Gaut, 19.15 as stat ed above, Gaut, includes fasting (anāšaka) among 'tapāmsi'.

G. Coulton in 'Five centuries of Religion (1936) vol. III. p. 27. Redemption of sin by monetary payments or by leaving property to the churches and monasteries was a very firm belief in the Middle Ages in Christian countries, so much so that men who had earned properties made large gifts to the church when the prospect of death was near and vast estates accumulated in the hands of churchmen, which led to the passing of the Statute of Mortmain in England,

Upavāsa ( fasting) 

Haradatta explains upavāsa187 as giving up the eating of boiled rice (bhaktatyāga) and adds that upavāsa is again included under tapāmsi to show the great importance attached to it. Haradatta notes that a predecessor of his relying on a Purāna passage explained u pavāsa in Gaut. 19.11 as 'restraint of senses'. In many of the Grhya sūtras upavāsa means only eating light food prepared from corn usable in sacrifices (such as rice) once in the day excluding vegetables, māṣa (pulse), salt and flesh (compare Gobhila gr. I. 5.26, Khădira gr. II. 1.4 and 6, Kausika sūtra I. 31-32, Kathakagrhya 46.2128). The Br. Up. IV. 4. 22 closely associates 'anāśaka' (fasting) with tapas as a means to the mystic realisation of the Supreme Soul129 Jaimini (III. 8. 9 11) appears to regard fasting as tapas130. Manu XI, 203 (=Visnu Dh. S. 54.29) provides that fasting (for a day) is the penance for omitting the rites ordained by the Veda (such as the Darśapūrņamāsa sacrifice and the performance of sandhya adoration) and for neglecting the special duties of a snātaka (laid down in Manu IV. 34 ff). When a person was observing a fast he had to avoid doing certain other actions. Acc. to Devala a fast becomes bereft of its good results by drinking water often, by chewing tâmbulat'by sleep in the day-time and by sexual intercourse131 ; but the Garudapurāṇa I. 128.6 and Bhavisya purana (I. 184.27) allow even when one is fasting the use of flowers, ornaments, rich clothes, garlands, unguents, applying collyrium to the eye and the cleansing of teeth. Daksa quoted by the Par. M. states that if a man observes a fast for the day and night on the day on which the sun first turns towards the

north or south, or on the Vișuva day (day of equinox), and on an eclipse of the sun or the moon and bathes he is freed from all sins132. Manu XI. 166 (=Agnipurāņa 169.31) prescribes a fast for three days as a penance for theft of grass, firewood, tree, dry food (i. e. grains of rice), jaggery, clothes, hide and flesh, The Anušāsanaparva (106.1) remarks133 that men of all varnas and even Mlecchas thought highly of fasts and that chapter contains an exaggerated eulogy of fasting. Almost all religions (except Zoroastrianism) such as the Hebrew, Christian (in Lent) and Moslem (in Ramjan) emphasize the necessity of fasting as a discipline or as a preparation for penitence. The Bhavisya purāņa (I., chap. 16. 12-14) states that those who have not kind led sacred fires can please the gods by vratas, restraints, gifts and particularly by upavāsas and points out (verses 18-22) what substances (eatables) should be given up from the first to the 15th tithi in each fortnight. In the Satapatha Brāhmana and the srauta and grhya sūtras the word upavasatha is used in the sense of 'upavasa' and is derived from 'vas' (to dwell) with 'upa'. Vide. H. of Dh. vol. II, p. 1010 and n. 2276 for the Sat. Br. The Khadira gr II. 1.4, Gobhila, gr. I. 6.2, Kausika-sutra I. 31 employ the word upavasatha. Āp. Dh. S. II.1.1.4-5. prescribe an upavāsa for husband and wife on parvan days and if they cannot totally abstain from food they should eat only once by day food proper for upavāsa. Aparārka p. 199, Smr. C. (srāddha p.355) and Krtya ratnākara quote a verse from Vyāsa deriving the word upavāsa13a The Ap. Dh. S. II, 5. 9-13, Baud. Dh. II, 7.32, Vas. 6.21 and San. gr. II. 16.5 have the same verse viz. 'an āhitāgni, a draught ox and brahmacãrin, these three fulfill (their work) by eating; they cannot fulfill their duties by non-eating'. This is explained as not applying to prāyaścittas (Baud. Dh. S II, 7.34) and to fasts on Ekādaśī, The Santiparva 323.17 states "Just as a dirty garment is afterwards cleansed by water, so to those who are heated in the fire of) fasting inexhaustible happiness for a long time comes.' Santi 79.18, however, says 'merely emaciat ing the body by fasting is not tapas, but ahimsā, truthfulness, freedom from cruelty, restraint and compassion are tapas'.

Tirthayatra (Pilgrimages) 

55 

Tirthayātrā: Pilgrimage will be dealt with exhaus tively in a later section. It was believed that going on a pilgrimage and bathing in such holy rivers as the Ganges freed a man from sins. Viṣnu Dh. S. (35.6) lays down that those guilty of mahāpātakas may become pure by Aśvamedha sacrifice or by visiting all the sacred places on the earth. Devala says that a man removes the consequences of such grave sing as the murder of a brāhmana that he may have committed uninten tionally by the performance of great sacrifices or by going on a pilgrimage. Parāśara (XII, 58 ff) prescribes 134 pilgrimage to see Rāma's bridge to Lankā for a murderer of a brāhmana who has studied the four Vedas. Devala states: 'a man becomes freed from sin by approaching holy places and shrines, brāhma nas that practise austerities, that all rivers that fall into the ocean, all great mountains, all shrines and all forests are holy.' The Matsyapurāņa (184.18) says that a heap of sins as big as the mountain Meru or Mandara becomes destroyed when man reaches Avimukta (Benares). The Kurmapurana135 (pürvārdha 29.3) says: 'I do not see any other expiation for destroying all sins in the Kaliyuga for all beings except Benares'. Even in the times of the Peshwas of Poona pilgrimage was prescribed for brāhmaṇa murder (vide 'Selections from Peshwa Records, vol. 43 p. 107) and the brāhmapas were ordered that after the sinner performed the penance they were to dine with him and recognize that he had been purified. In an order dated sake 1659 (1737 AD) the Peshwa Bajirao the first informs the Deshmukhas, Deshpandes and Mukadams that four brothers named Zende approached him with the story that their father was born when their paternal grandmother lived with one Pilaji Zende after she became a widow and that she intended to remarry that man but that had to be postponed owing to famine, that the caste meeting were prepared to take them into the

Then the Peshwa issued an order that they should go to Tulapur on the banks of the Bhimā river and that they and their male progeny together with their wives should be restored back to the caste and complete association with them as to taking food and marriage be carried on with them from generation to genera tion,136 The Pr. Prakāśa quotes a verse from the Bhavisya purāṇa about the penance for brāhmana murder to the effect that for him who dwells to the north of the Vindhya mountain Parāśara prescribes the sight of Setubandha as a penance and then remarks that a man from the north of Vindhya has to travel 360 yojanas to reach Setubandha and that since 360 Prājāpatya penances are declared to be enough to remove the sin of brahmahatyā, it impliedly follows that each yojana towards a tirtha is equal to one Prājāpatya, The Smrtyar thasāra (pp. 149-150 ) quotes several verses from the Puranas stating that gods like Brahmā, Visnu and Siva, great sages like Bhrgu, Vasistha and Viśvāmitra, great kings like Hariscandra, Nala, Sagara obtained greatness by means of tirthas and that Pāndavas, Sri Krsna, Nārada, Vyāsa and other sages engaged in pilgrimages for securing kingdoms and for removal of evil fortune.

CHAPTER III PRĀYAŚCITTA; ITS ORIGIN, DERIVATION 

AND MEANING 

It is now necessary to turn to prāyaścittas as removers of sin. A number of subjects will fall to be treated here, 

First, an attempt must be made to understand the etymo logy and meaning of the word 'prāyascitta' in ancient times. There are two forms of the word, prāyaścitti and prāyaścitta, which occur in Vedic works without distinction of meaning and both forms are fairly old, though prāyaścitti appears to be the older of the two. The form prāyascitti frequently occurs in the Tai, S. (as in II, 1.2,4, II. 1 4.1, III. 1,3,2-3, V. 1.9.3, V. 3.12.1) 136a. In some of these passages no question of sin arises. The word means 'doing some thing which would get rid of some accidental happening or mishap such as the breaking of an ukha (a pot or saucepan for boiling or cooking) or the sun's losing its brilliance,' In Tai. S. V. 3.12.1 the word is used in the sense of an expiation for a sin. So even in very old books the word had two shades of meaning. The Kausitaki137 Br. (vi, 12) states : ""they say 'whatever mistake or excess occurs in the sacrifice that affects the priest brahmā, that he treats with the three fold learning (i. e. the three Vedas)". The word also occurs in the Atharvaveda XIV. 1.30, Vāj. S. 39.12 (in close proximity to niskrti), in the Ait. Br. V. 27, in the Sat. Br. IV.5.7.1, VII. 1.4.9, XI. 5.3.8, XII. 4.1.6 and in other works also. The form prāyaścitta occurs in Kausitaki Br. V. 9, VI 12 and elsewhere. The Āśv. Śr. III. 10.38 and śānkhāyana Śr. III. 19.1 respectively employ the words prāyascitti and prāyaścitta138 In Pār. gr. I.

10 the form 'prāyaścitti' is employed. Jai. in several places * employs the word prāyaścitta (as in VI. 3.7, VI. 4.10, VI 5.45 and 49, XII. 3.16). Sabara 139 on the last sūtra (XII, 3.16) ex plains that the prāyaścittas (in the Sruti texts) are of two kinds, viz. some are meant to make good the defect in the procedure and materials of sacrifice which arises or befalls through some neglect or heedlessness, while others are subsidiary parts of a rite when an occasion arises i. e. they are undertaken to atone for not doing what is ordained or doing something which is forbidden (e. g. non-performance of daily Agnihotra even though the sun rises). The Sat. Br.140 XII. 4 and Ait. Br. 32.2-11 pro vide some interesting and amusing examples of the mishaps for which prāyascittas are provided e. g. when a vicious boar, ram or dog runs between the sacrifical fires, or if Agnihotra milk gets spilled while the cow is being milked or if the milk pot is turned upside down or if it were to break, or if the cow were to lie down while being milked, or if the fire were to go out after the first libation is offered etc. Vide also Mānava-gphya I. 3, Hir. gr. I.-5.1-16, Bhāradvāja gr. II. 32, Kausika-sūtra 46. 14-55, Aģv. Sr. III. 10 and Asv. gr. III. 6-7 for similar occurrences and prāyaścittas. The Mahābhāsya on Pāņ. VI. 1.157 explains111 both prāyascitti and prāyaścitta on the analogy of the word Pāraskara. Prāyascittas may be said to be, in the language of the Mimāmsā, either kratvartha or puruṣārtha. The former are prescribed in the Srautasütras. It is the latter kind of prāya scittas that are generally dealt with in Smrti works on prāya Ścitta. In this work the prāyaścittas mentioned in Srauta

Derivation of Prāyaścitta 

59 

works are passed over, as they have either been mentioned in vol. II. or were of rare occurrence even in olden days. 

Most digests and commentaries derive the word prāyascitta relying: on a verse (attributed to Angiras142 by some) from prāya (meaning 'tapas') and citta (meaning resolve or firm belief), the idea being that prayascittas are so called because of their association with or emergence from a resolve to under go tapas or because of the firm belief that it will be a means of the removal of sin. Various other derivations are suggested by some writers. The Balambhatti143 on Yaj. TIL 206 quotes a half verse to the effect that 'prāya' means 'sin' and 'citta' means 'purification', which had been quoted by Paksadharamisra144, Bhaktūpādhyāya and the Todarānanda, but the Pr. M. (p. 2) says that the source or authenticity of that verse is doubtful. Hemādri refers to an unnamed bhāsyakāra's explanation viz. 'prāya' means 'destruction' and 'citta' imeans joining together' and prayascitta means the making good what is lost and that the word denotes a naimittika action on sin. 

The Par. M. quotes a smrti text145 and says that that is prāyaścitta whereby the 'citta' (the mind) of a repentant sinner is made generally (prayasah) free (from emotion i, e. brought to a normal state) by the parṣad (assembly of learned brāhmaṇas). 

Here 'prāyah seems to be taken as equal to 'prayasan' and 'citta' has its usual sense, In Sayapa's146 comment on the

prāyah' is composed of two parts 'pra' and 'ayah' and means “happening or finding' (of the non-performance of what is ordained) and citta' means 'knowledge'; and so religious obser vances after knowing a certain happening are called praya ścittas. The Pr. Vi. p. 3 and Pr. Tattva p. 467 quote Hārīta and give147 yet another derivation (from 'prayata' pure and 'cita' collected), in accordance with which 'prāyascitta' means such actions as tapas, gifts and sacrifices whereby a man becomes purified (prayata) and destroys his accumulated sins ('cita' being equal to ‘upacita'), just as clothes are made clean by the employ ment of salts, moist heat, putting in boiling water on a fire, and washing in water. Hence, as the Mit, says, the word prāya scitta conventionally148 denotes a certain act or rite of the naimittika type (since it takes place only when an occasion arises) intended for the destruction of sin (and therefore being desired for removal of sin it may also be called kāmya). The Par. M. quotes verses from Bphaspati's149 work of which the section on prāyascitta holds at the beginning and at the conclusion thereof that prāyaścitta is naimittika150 (to be performed when a cause

150, Actions are divided into three kinds, nitya, naimittika and kanya. Nitya acts are those like sandhya-vandana (which are obligatory and performed daily as a duty and which if not performed lead to sinful ness); naimittika are those acts which have to be done only on some occasion (as a bath on an eclipse) and kāmya rites are those which are performed out of a desire to secure some object (as the sacrifice called putreṣti for a som).

or occasion arises). Jābāla q. in the Pr. Prakāśa holds that prāyaścitta partakes of the nature of both naimittika and kāmya actions. The Pr. Prakasa finds fault with the definitions of prāyaścitta proposed by the Kalpataru, Sūlapāni and others and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that those alone are prāyascittas which are so spoken of by the learned, just as on Jaimini II, 1.32 (tac-codakesu mantrākhyā) Bhattācārya explains that mantras are those which the respectable yājnikas and those who studied the Vedas so designate1504 

Sins as stated by Bphaspati151 and others are of two kinds, viz, intentionally committed and unintentionally committed. 

Great divergence of views has prevailed from very ancient times as to whether prāyaścittas can destroy sins intentionally committed. Manu XI. 45 and Yaj. III. 226 are positive that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by prāyaścittas or by the study of the Veda. The difficulty arises about sins com mitted intentionally or with full knowledge. Gaut. (19. 3-6 * Vas. 22. 2-5) states two views, 1514 one holding that praya scitta should not be performed since deeds (here sinful deeds) are not destroyed (except by experiencing the consequences thereof), the other view holding that prayascitta should be per 

(Continued from the last page) crimes in former lives men are born blind or idiots &c.) penances must always be performed for the sake of purification, because those whose sins have not been expiated are born with disgraceful marks.' Though Manu employs the word ' nityam' here, what is meant is that when a sin is com mitted, a prayascitta must necessarily be performed and it is not left to the volition of the sinner whether to perform it or not. Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 220. But it does not follow from this that if prayascitta for removing a sin is not performed, another sin is thereby committed, for in that case there would be anavastha (regressus ad infinitum ).

formed (for the removal of the effects of sin). The latter relies upon certain indications in Vedic passages. Gaut. relies upon four such passages. The first says "152 'after performing the punaḥstoma 153 one can come back to (become fit for) soma sacri fice (i, e. for Vedic rites in general). Another indication is : "after performing Vrātyastoma (one becomes fit for Vedic sacri fices).' A third is: 'He, who offers the Aśvamedha sacrifice, crosses beyond all sin, beyond brāhmaṇa murder'. The fourth is: one should make a person charged with grave sins per form the Agnistut. Vasistha also (20. 1-2) gives expression to the two views about the efficacy of penances. 154 Manu XI. 45 (latter half) states, that according to some, prāya cittas may be prescribed for the removal of intentionally committed sins from indications contained in the Vedas. It cannot be said that these Sruti passages are mere arthavādas (i. e. laudatory texts). They must really be taken, though expressed in the form of ordinary arthavādas, as laying down (a vidhi) that one desirous of destroying his sins should perform Aśvamedha and the other sacrifices mentioned. In this case the maxim of rātrisattra 155 applies (vide Jai. IV. 3. 17–19). There are certain sattras (sacrifices extending over more than twelve days) called Trayo

The Vratyastoma is also an ekaha, which was prescribed for those whose upanayana was not performed at the proper time (and who had therefore become patita-sāvitrika). Yaj. I, 38 provides vratyastoma for patita savitrika. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 377 and p. 385 (for its description from the Tāndya Brāhmaṇa). The Agnistut is an ekāha (vide Tai. Br. II. 7. 12 and Asv. Sr. IX. 7 22-25). Manu XI. 74 prescribes Ašvamedha, Gosava or Agnistut and several other sacrifices for the removal of the grave sin of brahmana murder.

Maxim of Rātrisattra

dasarātra, Caturdasarātra and so on. All these are called rātri sattras. With reference to these a Vedic passage says 'those who approach i. e. perform) these rātrisattras attain stability (long life or super-eminence)'. In the text prescribing the rātri sattras there is no mention of any special reward for perfor mance. Therefore stability' (pratiṣtha) contained in the passage must be held to be the reward of the performance of rātrisattras and not mere heaven (which is the reward of all sacrifices for which no special reward is mentioned, according to Jai. IV. 3. 15-16). The same maxim applies to passages like Yāj. III. 226 which say that sin is removed by penances 156. Medhātithi draws attention to the story in the Tai. S. VI. 2.7.5, Kathaka S. VIII, 5, Ait. Br. 35.2 that Indra consigned yatis to Sālāvskas (dogs or wolves) and had to perform the rites called Upahavya to get rid of the sin. Manu states his own opinion in the next verse (XI. 46) that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by the recitation of Vedic texts and sins committed intentionally through folly are destroyed by various prāyascittas. Yāj. III. 226 (latter half) appears to hold that prāyaścittas do not destroy sins intentionally committed, but the sinner undergoing the prescribed penance becomes fit to be associated with other people on account of the texts (laying down the prāyaścittas); but Yaj. implies, it seems, that the results of sin intentionally committed (such as Hell and the like) are not got rid of. Manu XI. 189 prohibiting social in tercourse with sinners who have not performed penance practi cally conveys the same idea as that of Yāj. in III. 226 (latter half). Yāj. III, 220 observes that a man guilty of pātakas should perform prāyaścitta for his own purification (here and in the next world); in this way (i. e. if he performs penance) his inner soul recovers its composure and the people also become satisfied. This verse puts in a nutshell the purposes of prayascittas as conceived by the smộtis, viz. purging of sin (or purification), the satisfaction of the sinner's mind, admission to intercourse with

all people, Chagaleya157 holds that prayascittas free the sinner from the consequences of sins committed unintentionally, but no penance exists which frees a man from the consequences of sins knowingly committed except in the case of upapātakas and in suicides or attempts at suicide. The Par. M. (II. 1. pp. 200-201) cites a verse of Jābāli and verses of Davala setting forth the two views about the efficacy of prāyascittas, while it also cites the view of Baudhāyana-smrti that there is no prāyaścitta for sins committed knowingly and the view of Angiras that the penance is double in the latter casa'58, Angiras further says that prāyascittas do destroy the sin arising from committing acts that are forbidden and the like, just as the rising sun removes dark ness. Manu XI. 47 provides: 'A twice-born man having become liable to perform a ponance (for a sin), whether he committed it through fate or by some act committed in a former existence, must not have intercourse with virtuous men until he performs the proper penance.' Ap. Dh. S. (I.9.24.24-25) provides Ifa man slays a guru (father, Vedic teacher &c.) or a brāhmana who has studied the Veda and finished the ceremonies of a soma sacrifice he shall live according to these very rules (contained in Ap.

But his sin is removed (at his death)'.159 It appears to follow from Apastamba's words that penance ending in death destroys the sin. The same was the view of Angiras, Yama and others.

Twofold Consequences of sin 

65 

In this conflict among the authors of smrtis the solution proposed by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 226 has been accepted by most medieval writers and is as follows160. The potentialities and consequences of sins are twofold, viz those leading to Hell and the others preventing intercourse with members of the society to which the sinner belongs. Therefore, even though a prāya scitta may not be efficacious to prevent the first mentioned consequence (viz fall into Hell), there is nothing improper in prāyaścitta being effective in removing the obstacle to associa tion with other people. As to sinful acts that are not pataniya (do not cause loss of caste) prāyaścitta does destroy such sin fulness as expressly stated by Manu. XI. 46. Even as to sins that are pataniya and are committed intentionally, if a penance ending in death is undergone as laid down by Manu XI. 73, Yai. III. 247-248 and Gaut. 22.2-3 for brahmana murder; Manu XI. 90-91, Yāj. III, 253, Gaut. 23.1 for drinking surā; Gaut, 23.8 11, Manu XI. 103-104 and Yāj. III. 259 for sexual intercourse with the guru's wife; Manu XI. 99-100 and Yāj. III. 257 for theft of brahmana's gold; then the sin is destroyed as stated by Ap. Dh. S. I.9.24.25and I. 10.28.18 quoted above. When Manu says (in XI. 89 latter half) that there is no penance for the sin of slaying a brāhmaṇa intentionally, the proper interpretation of this read along with Manu XI. 46 quoted above is not that there is total absence of prāyaścitta in such a case, but that ordinary prāya soittas (such as those in Manu XI. 72) would not do in such a Case, but only very heavy ones that would end in death. Medi eval digests like the Prayascitta-muktavali (folio 32a) hold that according to the Kalivarjya section penance ending in death is forbidden in the case of brāhmaṇa sinners and therefore a

brāhmaṇa murderer can only be made to undergo the twelve years' penance. 

The Par. M. (II. part 1 pp. 201-203) sets out this view of the Mit, and appears to hold it itself. It sets out another view also. Those who hold this latter view read Yaj. III. 226 as 'kāmatosvyavahāryastu' with an avagraha. The meaning then is that one who has performed the penance prescribed for a sin does not fall into Hell, but he cannot be allowed to associate with good men (śistas ) if he is guilty of a wilful sin. There is a verse of Manu (XI. 190 = Vispu Dh. S. 54.32 ) that one should not associate with those who slay children, who return evi) for the good done to them, who slay those that come for protection and who kill women, even though they might have become purified by undergoing the appropriate penance. There is a similar verse of Yāj. III. 298 on which the comment of Vijñāneśvara is most interesting as indicative of the spirit of our medieval writers who were always oppressed by the might of words (Vedic or smrti) deemed as authoritative. The Mit. remarks:161 'the prohibition (contained in Yāj. III, 298) is based on the text alone (and not on logic or reasoning). What cannot a text do? There is nothing too heavy for a text. Therefore, even though a light penance is prescribed for slaying an adulterous woman, still there is a prohibition against associating with such slayers based on the words of the text'.

Even Sankaracarya relies on these words of Sabara in his bhāsya on Vedāntasūtra III. 4.32. When Yāj. I. 58 says that a son born of a brāhma form of marriage renders 21 generations holy (10 paternal ancestors, ten descendants and himself) Visvarūpa says that this is all laudatory of the brāhma form and not to be taken seriously as it would be contrary to the doctrine of Karma; but then he turns round and says that it may be taken literally as stated by those who know Mimamsa 'स्तुतिमात्रमेतद्भूतानां भाविनां पावनानुपपत्तेः। उपपत्ता वा कृतनाशाकृताभ्यागमप्रसङ्गात् । यद्वास्तु फलविधिः । विवाहविशेषस्य फलविशेषापेक्षत्वात्। न चागमानुसारिण्यर्थेऽनुपपत्तिरिति शक्यं वक्तुम् । तथा च नैयायिकाः-न हि वचनस्यातिभारोऽस्तीत्याहुः। विश्वरूप गया.

IV1 The Power of Authoritative Texts This maxim is taken from the bhāsya of Sabara and is a favourite device with all Dharmaśāstra writers from Visvarüpa downwards to justify any statement of the smrtis however illogical or exaggerated it might appear to be. The Pr. T. (pp. 544-545) quotes 162 the Mit, about the two saletis of sin and its remarks on Yāj. III. 298 and does not approve of them, relying on the words of Bphaspati that no decision should be arrived at on the bare words of the sāstra, but it should also be supported by reasoning and that the words 'slayers of women' do not refer to adulterous women but to innocent women (such as the wives of one's enemies ). Nārada (sāhasa, verse 11) holds that those who are punished by the king with a fine of the first or second (madhyama) kind can be allowed to associate with other members of society but those who are awarded the highest fine should not be spoken to by others 162a. Those who take the view of the sinner's inability to associate with other men even after undergoing penance rely also upon Vedanta-sūtra III, 4. 43 (bahis-tübhayathāpi smrterācārācca). The Par, M. very rightly points 163 out that the sutra refers to those who after going in for life-long celibacy abandon the duties of that stage of life (āśrama) and that it does not refer to householders and quotes a verse of 

Kausika in support. The Smrti-muktaphala (Pr., pp. 867-868) refers to this discussion contained in the Par. M. The Pr. M. (p. 7) appears 104 to hold that the great Sankarācārya explained

Vedāntasutra III. 4. 43 after reading Yāj. III, 226 as 'kāmatos vyavahāryastu' and that those who fell from the vow of life-long celibacy (either as naisthika brahmacārins or as sannyāsins ) were to be excommunicated (and not to be associated with ). The printed editions of the bhāsya contain no express quotation of Yājñavalkya's verse, but from the fact of his quoting Atri's verse it is possible to hold that Sankarācārya understood Yajñavalkya as the Pr. M. says he did. 

A question may naturally be asked: why should it be accepted that penances destroy sin (as stated in Yāj. III. 226). The answer is: what 165 actions are grave sins or minor sins or not sins at all is laid down by the śāstra (śruti and smrtis). For example, it is not clear to ordinary people why being an officer over mines or making friends of low people or being a servant of a sūdra should be a sin at all. But the smrtis say so. If the smrtis are to be relied upon for determining what acts are sinful, then it follows as a matter of course that the same smrtis which speak of penances as removers of sins must also be accepted and that no other means for determining the efficacy of penances can be appealed to. So also the Bhagavad gitā (IV. 37) states that the fire of spiritual knowledge consumes all (accumulated, sancita) actions (and their consequences). 

Many of the sins (though not all) for which penances are provided in the smrtis are also offences punishable by the king or State. For example, murder, theft, incest, perjury are acts punishable by the State in almost all countries even now and were so in ancient and medieval India. Persons guilty of these were also liable to undergo prāyascittas. It is probably due to this double liability that punishments for crimes in ancient and medieval India were light as compared with the heavy punish ments for even trifling crimes inflicted in western countries only a century or two ago. But there are other acts which are not punishable by the State now and were not probably punished even in ancient or medieval India by the king. For example, forgetting Veda studied by a person, not tending Vedic fires consecrated by a person himself, sleeping till after sun-rise and sleeping at sunset are pātakas, acc. to Vas. I. 19 and some of those are upapātakas acc. to Yāj. III. 239. It does not seem

likely that an Indian king ever punished any person for these. On the other hand, obstructing the road, prying when the king is taking his meals, sitting before the king on one's haunches, speaking loudly before the king are among the fifty chalas of which the king could take cognisance suo motu and award suitable punishment (vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 266). But there is nothing to show that such actions ever fell within the purview of the rules about prāyascittas. The important questions are: What was the relation of the rules about prāyaścittas which were to be prescribed by a pariṣad (a meeting of learned brāhmanas) to punishments by the king as regards actions which were both pūtakas inviting penances and crimes entailing punishments by the King? Which of these two sets of rules was earlier? Were penance and punishment cumulative or alternative? It is difficult to give definite opinions on these questions. We know that prāyascittas like Aśvamedha are spoken of even in the Tai. S. We also know that the praśnavivāka (which is quite close to prādvivāka in derivation and meaning ) occurs in the Vāj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai. Br. III. 5. 6. Therefore it follows that judicial functions were very early separated from the executive functions of the king. The reference to the ordeal of fire in the Tandya Br. 14. 6. 6 (vide H. of Dh. vol. III p. 361) and the grasping of a red-hot hatchet in the hand by a person accused of theft and his being killed show that ordeals were administered and the punishment for theft was death. Brhaspati, quoted in the Vivādaratnākara, says 'When a man of good character and a diligent reader of the Veda has com mitted theft he shall be kept in prison for a long time and shall be caused to perform penance after having been compelled to restore the goods' (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 362 166). 

The pariṣad made its own rules about prāyaścittas and the king awarded punishments. Which set of rules was earlier it is difficult to say. The king did not very probably interfere with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the pariṣad and the brāhmaṇas helped the king in the administration of justice by being judges and by advising him as to the punishments to be imposed (vide

Visnu Dh. S. V. 194). Gautama VIII,1, echoing the words of the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 5, observes: 167 'the king and the brāhmana with profound learning uphold the moral order in the world (or are upholders of the sacred law). The Āp. Dh, S. (II. 5. 10.12-16) contains very important information: The 'ācārya shall order those who, while participating according to the śāstras (in the privileges and responsibilities of their castes), have gone astray through the weakness of their senses to perform penances accord ing to the dictates (of the smộtis) commensurate with their (sinful) acts. If they transgress their ācārya's order he shall take them to the king. The king shall send them to his purohita proficient in dharmaśāstra and the science of government. He (purohita) shall order them to perform (proper penances) if they are brāhmaṇas. He shall reduce them by forcible means except corporal punishment and slavery.' So this passage shows that the king helped in carrying out prayas cittas. Nārada includes 'neglect of penances' among matters solely dependent on the king (prakirņaka, verse 3) and not on complaints by private individuals. Devala 168 probably conveys the real position when he says: The king is the giver of krcchras (i. e. his consent is required for actually undergoing the prescribed penances), the learned man who has studied Dharmaśāstras prescribes the prāyaścitta, the sinner carries out the penance and the king's officer sees to the safe performance of the prescribed penance.' Parāsara VIII. 28 says 'an assembly should point out the proper penance after getting the permission of the king, it should not be done without reference to him, but slight penance may be done with out informing him'. The Par. M. II. part 1. p. 232 explains that this applies to prāyaścittas for sins like govadha or those that are greater than it. Devala 169 also has similar verses.

IV) Relation of the Pariṣad and the King Parāśara VIII, 29 states that the king also should not ignore the pariṣad and should not by himself prescribe penance. Paithinasi quoted by the Dandaviveka (p. 76) provides 170 for both prāya citta and punishment and from the tenor of the verse it appears that both were to be enforced by the king. The posi tion is tolerably clear as to medievel times. One feels great hesitation in stating definitely the relation of punishment to penances and the king's position as to both in ancient times. Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 1-4 provide 171 that one who kills a ksatriya or a vaisya or a sūdra shall respectively give one thousand cows, a hundred cows and ten cows for the purpose of removing the enmity and that in each of these cases one bull was to be given in addition for the purpose of expiation. Apastamba does not expressly state to whom the cows were to be given. The commentator Haradatta explains that they were to be given to brāhmanas. Manu XI, 127, 129, 130, and Yāj. III. 266-267 have similar provisions but in the chapter on penances. On the other hand, Baud. Dh, S. I. 10. 23. expressly states that the Cows are to be given to the king. As both the words 'vaira niryātanārtham' and 'prāyaścittarthah' are employed by Ap. it may be said that the cows were to be made over to the king even according to Apastamba. The cows were to be made over to the king for bestowal on the family of the murdered person to mollify them and if they refused to receive them the king was 

ot to retain them for himself but was to distribute them among brāhmaṇas. We know that Manu (IX. 243-245) provides that the fine recovered from a man guilty of mortal sins was not to be taken for himself by the king but was to be offered to Varuna and thrown into water or was to be distributed among learned brāhmaṇas. Manu IX. 236 provides that for those who were guilty of the four grave sins ( brāhmaṇa murder &c.) and did not undergo penance for the same the king should inflict corporal punishment (branding on the forehead) toget her with fine in accordance with the śāstra. Manu IX. 237

( Matsya 227. 164) and Vispu V. 4-7 say that on the forehead a mark of female private parts with red-hot iron should be branded in the case of incest, the mark of a tavern flag in the case of drinking surā, the mark of dog's foot in the case of theft (of brāhmana's gold) and the mark of a headless trunk in the case of a brāhmaṇa-murder. Manu IX. 240 further prescri bes that men of all castes guilty of the four mahāpātakas com mitted unintentionally that perform the proper penance should not be branded on the forehead by the king but should be awarded the highest fine. Manu IX. 241 and 242 provide that a brāhmaṇa guilty of these grave sins unintentionally may be punished with the middle amercement (if he himself be possessed of good qualities) but if he was guilty of the grave sins committed intentionally he should be banished from the kingdom being allowed to take with him his wealth and paraphernalia; while persons other than brāhmanas when guilty of grave sins unintentionally committed were to be deprived of all their wealth and if guilty intentionally they were to be sentenced to death. These verses show that though prāyascitta be per formed persons guilty of grave sins were liable to undergo punishment and if no penance was performed then they were liable to branding and also fines etc. Manu XI. 56 provides that bearing false witness is similar to the drinking of surā and Manu XI. 57 and Yāj. III. 230 hold that misappropria tion of a deposit is like the theft of gold. Visnu Dh. S. (V. 169 ) provides that the misappropriator of a deposit was to be made to return the deposit or its price with interest and was to be punished like a thief by the king and V. 179 that a false witness had all his property confiscated. These instances establish that both fines by the king (i. e. rāja-danda) and penances prescribed by the assembly of learned men (i. e. parisaddanda or daiva danda) had to be undergone by those guilty of some grave sins that were also looked upon as crimes. In some cases the penance and the punishment were the same. For example, Gaut. 23. 10-11, Vas, 20. 13, Manu XI. 104, Yāj. III. 259 and several other smrtikāras prescribe for incest the penance of the excision of the testicles and penis and proceeding toward the south or south-west till the body falls. Nārada as quoted above prescribes for incest the punishment (danda) of the excision of the testicles. The Mit on Yaj. III. 233 quotas Nārada and remarks that the punishment of excision and deatk prescribed by Yāj. III. 233 applies only to non-brāhmaṇag ald that in such cases the punishment of death itself is the

prāyaścitta. There were works like the Madanapārijāta172 (p. 827) and the Mitākṣarā that held that the prohibition against corporal harm to brāhmaṇas (Manu VIII. 380) applies only to matters other than prayascittas and that since the Manusmrti itself (XI, 100) states that a brāhmana guilty of theft of brāhmana's gold may go to the king with an iron club and have his head smashed by the king, the death of a brāhmana as a penance for theft by being struck with a club presented by himself was not ruled out. In some cases punishment by the king was deemed to have purged a man of sin and no penance seems to have been thought necessary, as Manu VIII, 318 (=Vas. 19.45 ) says 'men that commit sins and are punished by the king become purified and reach heaven like good men who perform meritorious deeds.' The Mit on Yāj. III. 259 explains that this holds good only where the punishment is death, as in the case of incest noted above. Ap. Dh, S. II, 10.27. 15-16 provide 173 that a person guilty of slaying a man, of theft and of forcible seizure of land was to be deprived of his wealth by the king and was to be sentenced to death and that if the offender was a brāhmaṇa he was to have a piece of cloth tied over his eyes for the whole of his life (i. e, he was not to be sentenced to death). It appears that in very ancient times as provided by Āp. Dh, S. I. 9.25.4 the thief approached the king 174 with a club (of iron or khadira wood) on his shoulder and announced his guilt, when the king struck him with the club; on his being killed he became free from guilt. This was a penance as well as a legal punishment. Manu has a similar rule in his chapter on punishments (VIII, 314-316) providing that the thief should carry a weapon (called musala) or a club of khadira wood or a double-edged sakti or an iron staff and that if the king strikes him once with the club and he is killed

or if he is not killed but is allowed to go half dead and lives, the thief is freed from the guilt. The Mit, on Yāj. III. 257 quotes a prose passage from Sankha and a verse from Samvarta (122) to the same effect. Manu in the chapter on penances (XI. 100-101 = Agnipurāṇa 169. 20-21) provides the same procedure for theft as a penance. Vas. 20. 41, Yāj. III. 259, Visnu 52. 1-2 and Parasara XII, 69-70 provide a somewhat similar penance for the thief of brāhmana's gold. Vasistha introduces an important change viz., that the king hands over to the thief a weapon made of udumbara wood (or probably of copper) with which the thief is to kill himself. It appears that gradually the king gave up this unpleasant method of award ing punishment personally. Nārada 175 (parisista, verses 46-47) provides that after the thief comes running to the king and announces his guilt, the king was to touch him (with the club, as a symbolic gesture) and then let him off and the thief be came freed from sin by his confession of guilt. It has to be remembered, however, that the thief had to restore, even when he underwent penance, stolen property, as stated by Manu VIII, 40, Yāj. II, 36 and 270, Bșhaspati and by digests 176 like the Pr. Prakarana. If it were impossible to make the thief restore the stolen property the king had to make it good from his own treasury 197 (Gaut. X. 47, Sāntiparva 75. 10, Kautilya III, 16 ) or he had to make his officers 178 entrusted with the duty of preventing thefts pay the price of the stolen property (Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 26. 8). Vide for further details H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 166-168. It appears that the actual carrying out of the sentence of death was later on assigned to Candālas as stated by Manu X. 56 and Visnu Dh. S. 16. 11 (vadhya-ghātitvam cândālānām).

Circumstances to be considered 

15 

Another point to be noted is that as regards the awarding of punishments and prescribing of penances, the matters to be considered were the same viz. whether the lapse was inten tiona] 179 (kāmatah) or unintentional (akāmatah) or whether it was the first offence or whether it was repeated and what the circumstances as to the time, the place, the caste, the age, the capacity, learning, wealth were. Compare Kautilya IV. 10. Gaut. XII. 48, Manu VII. 16 and VIII, 126, Yaj.I. 368. Visnu v. 194, Vas. 19. 9 about punishments with Baud. 180 Dh. S. I. 1.16, Yāj. III, 293 ( = Atri verse 248 and Agnipurāṇa 173. 6), Angiras 143, Viśvāmitra, Vrddha-Harita IX, 297, and Vyāghra as regards penances. It is on account of this close connection between punishments and penances that the Prayascittatattva, after quoting Devala to the effect that if a man makes no move for taking prāyaścitta for one year, he has to undergo double penance thereafter and to pay a double fine to the king, re marks that the maxim is that prāyaścittas are to be moulded on the lines of punisbments 181. The Pr. M. (pp. 124-125) quotes Kāśyapa who provides a penance for one that causes mischief to a well, public park, bridge, rampart wall or a temple or idol, then quotes Visnu V. 169 which prescribes the highest fine for a breaker of idols, Manu IX. 285 which provides a fine of 500

panas for a breaker of idols and re-instatement of the idol by him and then remarks "dandavat prāyaścittāni bhavanti'. Nārada divided sāhasa into three kinds viz, prathama, madhyama and uttama, the last of which consisted in killing a person with poison or weapon, adultery and rape and injury to life. He then provides that when offenders guilty of the first two kinds were punished by the king, they became fit for association with the people, but that one guilty of the uttama-sāhasa, though punished by the king, was not fit even to be talked to (Nārada, sāhasa, verse 11). 

The king had jurisdiction 182 to punish sinners if they did not agree to undergo the prāyaścitta prescribed by the parisad but it is extremely doubtful whether he exercised that jurisdic tion in all cases. Society or the caste also had a weapon in its hand viz. that of excommunication by ghatasphota if one guilty of a grave sin refused to perform the prāyascitta prescribed (i, e. it was jātidanda). Vide Gaut. 20.2-9, Manu XI. 182-185 and Yāj. III, 294 and H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 388 and vol. III. p. 1009 1010 for the rite of ghatasphota and re-admission to caste after ghatasphota. Many of the prāyaścittas prescribed for the grave sins were terrible (such as throwing oneself into fire, drinking boiling surā or water or cow's urine or milk or ghee for drinking sura, Manu XI. 73, 90-91, 103 &c.) and were to be self-inflicted and were not to be prescribed by the parisad as the words of Manu in XI. 73 'icchayātmanah' and 'prāsyed-ātmānam-agnau vā' clearly convey and as some of the digests expressly provide 183. In order to enable a man to be come fit for intercourse with his caste men he had to give a dinner to them or distribute sweetmeats even after undergoing prāyaścitta. So it follows that a man guilty of a crime was liable to three burdens, punishment by the king, penance prescribed by learned brāhmaṇas and giving dinner or sweetmeats to castemen.

Vast Literature on prāyaścittas 

The literature on prāyaścittas is vast in extent, since in ancient times they loomed very large in the popular mind. Out of tho 28 chapters of the Gautamadharma-sūtra, ten (i. e. more than one-third of the whole) are devoted to penances. Out of the 30 chapters of the printed Vasiṣtha-dharmasutra, prāyascittas cover nine (20-28). Manu devotes verses 44 to 265 (in all 222) of chapter eleven to penances and the Yajñavalky asmrti con taining 1009 verses deals with prāyaścittas in 122 verses (III. 205-327). Several printed smrtis such as those of Angiras (168 verses), Atri (chapters 1-8), Devala ( 90 verses), Brhad-Yama (182 verses), Śatātapasmrti (in 274 verses) from the Anandaśrama collection of smrtis alone deal only with prāya scittas. Many other smrtis and several purāņas, such as the Agni (chap. 168-174), Garuda 52, Kūrma (Uttarardha 30-34), Varāha 131-136, Brahmānda (Upasamhārapāda chap. 9), Viṣnudharm ottara (II. 73, III, 234-237) contain hundreds of verses on prayaścittas. Besides commentaries like the Mitaksarā, Apararka, Par, M. and others and digests like Madanapārijāta (pp. 691-994), there are special digests dealing with prāyaścittas alone such as Hemādri on Prayascitta (which is of doubtful authenticity), the Prayascittaprakarana of Bhavadeva, Praya scittaviveka, Prāyaścittatattva, Sniftimuktāphala (prayascitta section), Prayaścittasāra (part of Nrsimhaprasada), Praya scittamayükha, Prāyaścittaprakāśa (ms. in the Anüp Sanskrit library, Bikaner, No. 2610), Prāyaścittendusekhara of Nāgojibhatta, which have been utilised in this work. The most elaborate treatment is found in Prāyascittaviveka, Par, M. II parts 1 and 2, and Prāyaścittaprakāśa. 

The commentatore discuss the question about the persons who have adhikara (capacity) for having penances prescribed for them. Since Manu XI, 44 (prāyascittiyate narah) and Yāj. III. 219 (narah patanam-rcchati) both employ the word 'man' without 184 any qualification, the commentators and digests say that penances are meant for men of all varņas, for all persons born of unions in the reverse order (pratilomajas) and for even candālas. Yāj. III. 262 states that a südra sinner

though he has no adhikāra (for recitation of Vedic mantras and homa), yet becomes purified by undergoing the observances (except japa and homa) for the periods prescribed. Angiras 185 provides that penance may be administered to a ģūdra devoid of japa and homa. Even as to japa and homa there were works like the Madanapārijāta p. 749 and Vy. M (p. 112) that relying on a verse of Parāśara VI. 63-64 held that a homa could be performed for women and südras in the ordinary fire through a brāhmana186. The Pr. V. relies on Manu X. 62 and a prose passage of Devala for the proposition that even Cāņdālas have to perform penances, if they act contrary to the rules and pro hibitions laid down for them. Since the non-performance of what is prescribed and doing what is forbidden lead to si the person guilty of these or the person who has a desire to destroy his sins is a person entitled to perform prāyaścitta, as also one who repents of his guilt. 

Before going into the subject of the several prāyascittas prescribed for each grave or minor sin, some questions of a general character have to be disposed of. 

Some smrtis like Brhad-yama III. 1-2 and Sankha state that a boy over five years of age and less than eleven years old, if guilty of some pātakas such as drinking surā, has not to undergo penance personally, but his brother, father or other

Did the author change his views or is the text of one of the two Mayūkhas tampered with by his successors? The pr. 673T (folio 30 b) explains Parāsara VI. 63-64 in a different way. It says that the verse does not lay down generally that a woman or any one else can in every case have a homa performed for her through a brahmana, but that where in a rite japa and homa are obligatory and the person concerned is unable to perform japa and homa in person there alone he can appoint a brābmana as pratinidhi. 37** w UETATEN 313771 farura यममात्रार्थत्वात् । प्रायश्चित्तागजपहोमयोस्तु निषेधादेवाप्रवृत्तेस्तत्र तस्यामवृत्तिः गतेजा। यन्महार्णवमदनरत्नयोः स्त्रीशूदादेविपद्वारा समन्त्रको जपहोमों भवत इति तत्परास्त

Prāyascittas and children 

relative or friend has to undergo it for him and that if a child is less than five then whatever act it may do it is not deemed a crime, nor is it a sin and it is not liable to any legal penalty nor to any 187 prayascitta. The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 243) comments that these verses are not meant to prescribe a total absence of prayascitta in the case of children of five or less but are meant to convey that they are not liable for the full prāyaścitta prescribed for a sin. Its argument is that the texts lay down generally without any reference to the stage of life that a brāhmana should not be killed or that a person belonging to the three higher castes should not drink surā.188 Hence any one of whatever age who is guilty of having done such prohibited acts is liable and the words of Gaut. II. 1 and of Kumāra are to be interpreted as not excusing altogether the drinking of surā by a child but as referring to minor lapses. Bșhaspati expressly states that the dictum about a child being allowed to eat what it likes is confined to such matters as will not fall under grave sins. 

It has already been stated above (n. 180) that the prāya scitta to be undergone depended upon many circumstances such as the time, the place, the age &c. And first as to age, several smrtig189 provide that a man 80 years old or a boy less than _187 ऊनैकादशवर्षस्य पञ्चवर्षात्परस्य च । प्रायश्चित्तं चरेद् भ्राता पिता चान्यः सुहृज्जनः॥ अतो बालतरस्यास्य नापराधो न पातकम् । राजदण्डो न तस्यास्ति प्रायश्चित्तं न विद्यते ॥ शङ्का, quoted by the मिता. on या.

16 years of age, women and diseased persons should be liable only to half the prāyascitta (prescribed for able-bodied men). The Mit, on Yāj. III. 243 quotes a verse of Sumantu that for a male below twelve and above eighty years of age the penance is half (of that for ordinary men) and one fourth for women within the same limits and a verse of Visnu that for women, old men and diseased persons half the penance should be prescribed and for boys ( before upanayana) only one-fourth. Some say that for boys less than five the penance is one-fourth. Cyavana ( prose) prescribes halí prāyascitta for boys, old men and women and declares that a person is a bāla up to 16 years and a man is to be regarded as similar to a bāla after 70. Katyāyana provided generally that the fines to be levied from females were to be half of those leviable from male offenders as regards all offences and when the punishment for a male would be death, a woman criminal was to be punished with the cutting of a limb (nose, éars &c. ) 190 

The difference between a sin committed unintentionally (akāmatah) and the same sin committed with full knowledge (kāmatah) is this that for the latter the prayascitta is double of what is prescribed for the former as provided by Angiras, 191 Vyāsa and the Agnipurana. As Yaj. III. 226 employs the word ‘ajñāna' in the first half and the word 'kāmatah' as its opposite in the second half instead of the word 'jñānatah' it follows that Yāj. makes no difference between the consequences of jñāna (knowledge ) and kāmanā (desire). 

The caste of the offender as well as of the victim made a difference in the prayascitta as well as in the legal punishment. Vide H. of Dh.vol. III. pp. 395-399 as to punishments for crimes dependent on caste. Visņu 192 provides that the prāyaścitta for

a ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra sinner should be respectively, 1 and 4 of what is prescribed for a brāhmana sinner. The Agni purāṇa says 193 the same thing. The Par. M. II. 1. p. 231 quotes the Caturvimsatimata 194 to the same effect. The Mit on Yāj. III, 250 explains that the verse of Caturvimsatimata applies to all cases except where any one of the four sāhasas is committed by a man of a lower caste as against one of a higher caste, Brhad-Yama (IV. 13-14) in prescribing penance for the kill ing of a cow provides the same scale of 4, 3, 2, 1 for the four varnas. Angiras (verse 3) prescribes the penances of Krochra and Cāndrāyana for a brāhmana partaking of the food of an antyaja, half of these for a ksatriya or vaisya guilty of the same. Yaj. II. 206-207 provide that the punishments for defamation depend upon the higher or lower varna or caste of the offender as well as of the person defamed and that if a ksatriya or vaiśya defames a brāhmana the fines are respectively twice or thrice as high as the fine for a brāhmana defaming a brāhmana and conversely if a brāhmana defames a ksatriya 'or a vaisya the fine is reduced by half in each successive caste. The Mit. quoting Angiras says that the rules about punishments apply to prāyaścittas for slaying a person i. e. if a brahmana slays anybody and a certain penance is prescribed for him, then a ksatriya killing the person would have to perform double the penance prescribed for the brāhmana and a vaiśya offender three times as much.195 It may be pointed out here that though the smrtis provided for . different punishments according to the castes of the offender and of the person wronged and though some commentaries and digests went into all those details for the sake of presenting a

complete statement or digest of the smrti material, such discriminatory punishments had mostly ceased to be enforced by the rulers from about the 12th century A.D. at least, as stated by the Smrticandrikā, the Madanaratna (vyavahāra) and the Sarasvatīvilāsa. Vide H. of Dh, vol. III p. 512 note 924 for the relevant quotations from the three works. Since, as stated above (n. 181), prāyaścittas were to be moulded on the lines of legal penalties, it appears that the discriminatory treatment about prāyaścittas depending upon the varņa of the sinner must also have gradually fallen into disuetude with the disappear ance of the more severe prāyaścittas and the substitution of cows and monetary equivalents in later digests. And some digests expressly state this to have been the case in relation to prāyaścittas. For example, the Pr. Prakarana, after quoting Gaut. 22. 14-16 about the prāyaścitta for killing a ksatriya or vaisya or sūdra under certain circumstances, remarks that in its day those prāyaścittas were no longer part of the practices of the people.196 

Whether an act made a man liable to undergo prayas citta depended in some cases on the country also. For example, marrying a maternal uncle's daughter was and is allowed in certain countries and among certain castes in the Deccan and Southern India on the ground of custom, but such a practice was severely condemned by Manu XI, 171-172 and Baud. Dh, S.I.1. 17–24 and other smrtis. Bệhaspati refers to this custom as prevalent among southerners and states that in these countries persons following it are not liable to undergo prāyaścitta or penalty (at the hand of the king). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 462 for Bphaspati's verses. 

Severity and extent of prāyaścitta depended also on the question whether a sinner had repeated the lapse or was a first offender. The Āp. Dh. S. (II. 10. 27. 11-13) prescribes that a brāhmaṇa who has once committed adultery with a married woman of equal class shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for a sūdra having intercourse with a woman of the three upper castes, that for every repetition of the crime) one

fourth of the penance must be added and if (he commits adultery) for the fourth time, the whole penance (of 12 years must be performed 197). The Mit, on Yāj. III, 293 remarks that for a sin that is committed knowingly the prāyaścitta is double of what is prescribed for the same sin if committed unintention ally and that if a sin is committed intentionally and is repeated then for the repeated lapse prayascitta is four times as much as that for the same deed done unintentionally. Similarly, the āśrama to which the sinner belonged made a difference in the prāyaścitta as stated by Angiras 'when persons in other āśramas are guilty of sins for which penance is prescribed if committed by householders, then the prayascitta is increased in the same proportion that is laid down for śauca (bodily purity 198). Manu V.137, Vas. VI. 19, Visnu Dh. S. 60. 26, Sankha 16.23-24 pro vide that Vedic students, forest hermits and sannyāsins have respectively to perform twice, thrice and four times as much sauca as is prescribed for householders (e. g. by Manu V. 136 

=Visnu 60.25). 

One convenient and merciful rule laid down by the smrtis was that if a man died in the midst of the period for which penance had to be performed (sometimes it extended to twelve years or more) he became free from the sin here and in the next world as stated by Harita, Vyasa and Yama199. 

Though the smrtis have entered into very great details about the prāyaścittas for different individual lapses, still they cannot be supposed to have dealt with every lapse. Therefore,

Gaut. (19. 18-20) provides that these acts (viz. Vedic recitation, tapas, fasting, gifts &c.) may be optionally performed, when no (particular penance) has been prescribed, that for grave sins difficult penances and for trivial faults easy ones may be pres cribed and that Krcchra, Atikrochra and Cāndrāyaṇa are pen ances for all sins.200-Manu XI. 209 (= Visnu 54,34) provides that for the expiation of offences for which no particular atonement has been prescribed, let (the parisad) prescribe a penance after considering the (offender's) strength and the nature of the offence. Parasara (XI.55-56) provides that the recitation of the Gayatri ten thousand times is the best penance for all sins and that Candrayana, Yavaka, Tulapurusa and serving cows destroy all sins. Yāj. III. 265 provides that a man is purified from all sins by undergoing the penance for cow-killing or by Cāndrāyana, observance for a month of the milk vrata or by Parāka. Manu XI. 117 provides for all upapātakas except the sin of sexual intercourse by one who is in the stage of Vedic student the penance prescribed for govadha or cândrāyana, 

One guilty of a sin, even though he may himself be a learned man, should approach an assembly of learned brāhmanas and after making some present (a cow or the like ) announcing the nature of his lapse seek their decision about the proper penance for his lapse (Yaj.201 III. 300 and Parasara VIII. 2). The Mit., Par. M., Pr. S. and other digests quote long passages in verse from Angiras 202 who provides that the sinner should

not conceal his lapse and lose time; he should bathe with his garment on, and with the garment still wet approach the asserbly and should prostrate himself on the ground. Thus the elders of the assembly ask the man prostrating himself before them 'what is your business, what is the trouble and what do. you seek from us'. The assembly then asks him to go aside a little and debate among themselves what the penance should be, considering all the circumstances of time, place, nature of the lapse, age &c. Then one of them at the desire of the assembly should declare the assembly's decision as to the proper penance after citing the smrti passages and reducing the penance in view of the weakness and other circumstances of the offender. It has already been stated that the pariṣad acted under the direction of the king in matters of prāyaścitta and that the king was not to interfere with the decision of the assembly. The principal stages in a penance were four viz. approaching the pariṣad, the declaration of the appropriate penance by the pariṣad, the actual performance of the penance declared and the announcing of the sinner's freedom from taint (Angiras q. by Pr. Prakāśa folio 27a 'upasthānam vratādeśascaryā suddhi prakāśanam prāyascittam catuspādam vihitam dharmakartr bhiḥ#"). 

It is not necessary here to set out the details of the consti tution of the pariṣad, of the qualifications of the sistas who were to be the members of the pariṣad and their privileges and duties. These points have already been discussed at length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 966-974. A few matters not stated there are mentioned here. Caste exclusiveness and pride had gone so far that Parāśara (VIII, 25) and the Caturvimšatimata quoted by Par. M. state that a dvija though he may be of bad character is to be honoured and not a südra who may have controlled his senses, that the advice of a südra even though learned and devoted to the knowledge of the śāstras should not be accepted like sacrificial food when licked by a dog 203.

The decision of the assembly should be unanimous 205 as far as possible. 

If the learned brāhmaṇas of the assembly knowing the proper prāyaścitta do not declare it in the case of those who are distressed by their own sin and seek direction, they incur sin similar to that of the seeker after proper penance 206

CHAPTER IV 

PENANCES FOR PARTICULAR SINS 

It is now proper to turn to the penances prescribed for individual sins of different types (grave sins, minor sins and the like). It may be noted that the smrtis contain numerous prāyaścittas for the same sin and that it is often difficult to reconcile all the dicta. The commentaries and digests such as the Mit, and the Prāyaścitta-viveka therefore try to assign to each penance an appropriate provision, looking to all the circum stances noted above (i.e. they are bent on 'visayavyavasthā').206a In this work, it is not necessary to set out in detail the numerous penances for numberless lapses that are prescribed in the several smrtis and digests. In the Sabdakalpadruma (part III) there is an analysis from the Prāyaścitta-viveka alone of the several lapses, the penances for them, the number of cows to be donated as substitutes, the monetary equivalents when even cows cannot be donated and the daksinā in each case, which occupy pages 321 to 364. Setting out all these lapses together with the penances for them would only be a matter of academic interest and of no practical value, as almost all the prāyaścittag have become antiquated and are hardly ever performed now except in the form of gifts of cows or money to brāhmanas, pilgrimages and recitation of Vedic mantras or japa of the names of some favourite deity such as Visnu or Siva. Therefore only a few typical sins alone will be taken for treatment here and later on a list of all penances with brief descriptions will be furnished 

First come the Mahāpātakas. Sankha 207 (17. 1-3) prescribes the following penance for the four mahāpātakas: the sinner should bathe thrice every day, should erect in a forest a cottage thatched with leaves, should sleep on the ground, should subsist

on leaves, roots and fruits, should enter a village for alms all the time declaring his misdeed, should eat only once a day, When the 12th year passes in this way, the thief of gold, the drinker of surā, the murderer of a brāhmana and one who is guilty of incest become free from sin. Visnu Dh. S. 34.1 speaks of sexual intercourse with one's mother, daughter or daughter in-law as ati pātaka and (34.2) provides that there is no penance except entering fire for this grave sin. The Bhavisyapurāṇa, Harita and Samvarta (q. by the Pr. V. p. 43) say the same. But other smộtis like Manu XI. 54 and Yāj. III, 227 treat mātr gamana as a mahāpātaka (gurutalpa-gamana) and intercourse with the daughter or daughter-in-law as equal to violating guru's bed (Manu XI, 58, Yāj. III. 233-234). Therefore we begin with the mahāpātakas the first of which is the murder of a brāhmana. Gaut. 22. 2-10, Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 10-25 and I. 9. 25. 12-13, Vas. 20. 25-28, Viṣnu Dharmasūtra 35.6 and 50. 1-6 and 15, Manu, XI. 72-82, Yāj. III. 243-250, Agnipurāṇa 169. 1-4 and 173. 7-8, Samyarta 110-115 and many others prescribe various penances for brāhmana-murder. As the treat ment of Manu is tolerably long, an analysis of it alone will be given here. Manu as stated by the Bhavisyapurāṇa (quoted by Kullūka on Manu XI. 72-82, Aparārka p. 1055 and Pr. V. p. 63) speaks of 13 separate penances for brahmahatyā.208. The general rule was that for a man of any class who is directly guilty of intentional murder of a brāhmaṇa the penance was to end in death209 The thirteen penances as set out by Govindānanda in his commentary (called Tattvārthakaumudi) on Prayascittaviveka (p. 63) are as follows: 

(1) The murderer of a brāhmaṇa should construct a hut in a forest and dwell therein for twelve years, should subsist on alms and should carry a piece of the head-bones of the murdered man on a staff. This is a very ancient penance and other smrtis add some details. For example, Gaut. 22. 4 provides that the sinner should submit to observances meant for a Vedic student (such as not partaking of flesh, honey etc. stated in

Gaut. 2, 19), should announce his sin and enter a village only for begging a]ms. Yāj. III. 243 prescribes that the sinner should have a piece of the head-bone in the hand (left) and another placed on a staff (in the right hand) and that he should eat a moderate quantity (i. e. only once a day). The carrying of the piece of the head-bone in one hand is not meant for begging alms therein but only as a symbol. There was some divergence of views on this point209. Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 14 further provides that he should beg for alms at seven houses in only a broken reddish vessel (of clay or copper) and wear a piece of hempen cloth round his waist that will reach a little above his knees and that if he got no food at the seven houses he had to go with out food that day and that he should protect cows and may for that purpose (for taking them out for grazing or bringing them back) enter the village again. The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 243) adds that the staff with head-bone on and the head-bone carried in the left hand are merely symbolic (in order to remind hin others of his being guilty of brāhmana murder), that he should on seeing an arya avoid his path (Gaut.22.5), that he. should keep standing by day and only sit down at night (Gaut. 22.6) and bathe thrice in the day (Gaut. 22.6). It is added by the Mit. that, if the murdered brahmana's head-bone cannot be had, that of any other brahmana would do.

tliat there would be an option where the details of several arrtis are in conflict. It was Visvarūpa 212 on Yāj. III, 237 who held that the procedure prescribed by each smrti was separate and that all details taken from different smrtis were not to be mixed up. According to the Mit. and Kullūka (on Manu XI. 72 ) this vrata for 12 years is appropriate in the case where a brāhmana is murdered unintentionally and Kullūka quoting Angiras provides that for intentional brāhmana murder the penance will be double (i. e. 24 years). The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 243) states that this observance for twelve years applies only to one who was himself directly the murderer of a brāhmaṇa and that the anugrāhaka has to undergo only 9 years' vrata, the prayojaka only six years, the anumantā only 41 years and the nimittin only three years. It is further provided by the Mit. (on Yaj. III, 243) following a verse ascribed to Manu (not found in the printed text) and Devala 213 that if a man commits several murders of brāhmaṇas one after another, and performs penance at one time for them, for two murders he has to undergo the penance for 24 years and for three murders 36 years and when he commits the 4th murder there is no penance (but only death is the penance). The Pr: T. (p. 468) on the other hand, 214 following the Bhavisya-purāņa holds that one per formance of the 12 years' penance is enough penance for the murder of several brāhmanas, on the analogy of the Kṣāmavati iṣti (Jai. VI. 4. 17-20 ) which is performed when both the purodāsas and the house are totally burnt up by accident before the oblations are offered. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 19 a) also says the same and adds that Devala's verse is to be interpreted as laying down that repetition of the same sinful act is more blamable. If the murderer of a brāhmana

was a ksatriya or a vaisya or a śüdra he had to perform the penance above described respectively for 24, 36 or 48 years (Smrtyarthasāra p. 105). Instead of staying in a hut for twelve years he may stay at the end of a village or a cowpen and should tonsure his head and the hair on the lips or he may stay in an hermitage or at the foot of a tree and should devote himself to doing good to brāhmanas and cows and should observe celibacy (Manu XI. 78 and 81). At the end of 12 years he destroys the sin of brāhmana-murder. 

(2) According to Ap. Dh, S.I. 9.25.12, Gaut 22. 3, Manu XI. 72, Yāj. III, 248, if a ksatriya intentionally killed a brāhmaṇa he may at his will enter a fight and if he were killed by his opponents who knew that he was a brāhmaṇa murderer or even if he was wounded and left unconscious on the field but subsequently recovered he should be free from the sin of brāhmana-murder. 

(3) According to Āp. Dh. S. I. 9.25.13, Vas. 20. 25-26, Gaut. 22.2, Manu XI. 74, Yaj. IHI. 247, he may cut off with an axe his hair, skin, blood, flesh, muscles, fat, bones and marrow and offer them into an ordinary fire kindled by him for the purpose and offer these eight offerings into it for Death 215 (Mrtyu) as the deity and then throw himself into fire (thrice with head downwards, according to Manu XI. 73). This pen ance is for intentional murder of a brāhmana by a ksatriya acc. to the Madanapārijāta and Bhavisyapurāņa q. by Pr. Prakāśa folio 95 a. to 

(4)-(8) The murderer of a brāhmana may perform the Aśvamedha sacrifice or Gosava or Abhijit or Visvajit or the threefold Agnistut (Manu XI. 74). The Aśvamedha could be performed only by a king or an emperor (samrāj). The others could be performed by any one belonging to the three higher classes. This applies only where the murder was unintentional as stated by Kullūka following the Bhavisyapurāṇa.216 Visņu

(9). Manu XI. 75 provides that for the removal of the sin of brahmahatyā, the sinner may walk one hundred yojanas, sub sisting on limited food, controlling his senses and reciting one of the four Vedas. Kullūka says that this applies only where the killing is unintentional and the victim is a mere brāhmaṇa by caste (i. e. has not studied the Veda &c.). For yojana, vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 145 note 185.217. 

(10) Manu XI, 76 provides that the murderer of a brāh mapa may make a gift of all his wealth to a brāhmana who has studied the Veda. 

(11) Manu XI. 76 and Yaj. III, 250 provide that the mur derer may donate to a worthy brāhmaṇa (who has studied the Veda and whose character is good) as much wealth as would suffice to maintain the latter throughout his life and a house with all paraphernalia. This is the view of Govindānanda. But the Mit, on Yāj. III, 250 appears to hold that Nos, 10 and 11 are not separate penances. It combines the two into one. viz, that if the murderer has no offspring then he was to donate all his wealth or if he had offspring he was to donate a house with paraphernalia. This explanation is certainly preferable. The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 105 ) states that if the murderer is devoid of qualities but is well-off he may give a house and lands sufficient for the maintenance of a worthy brāhmana or he may donate a house with appurtenances or if he be childless all his wealth.

ghee ) should follow the course of the (holy ) river Sarasvati in all its branches. This, acc. to the Bhavisyapurāṇa and Kullūka, applies where a mere brāhmana by caste (without Vedic learning) is killed intentionally by a man who is himself rich but has no vedic learning. The words 'pratisrotah sarasvatim' have been variously explained. Medhātithi explains as above. Aparārka, Sarvajñanārāyana and Rāghavānanda explain that the murderer should follow the course of the Sarasvati in the opposite direc tion from the sea to its origin. This appears to be a better explanation, since it brings out the force of 'pratisrotah' more clearly. 

(13) It is provided by Manu XI. 77 and Yāj. III. 249 that the murderer should recite in a forest thrice the samhitū text of the Veda, while gubsisting on limited food. The express mention of samhitā text precludes the pada text or krama. The Bhavisyapurāpa and Kullūka hold that this penance is proper where a mere brāhmaṇa by birth (without Vedic learning ) is killed unintentionally, 

Manu XI. 79, Yāj. III. 244 and 246, Vas. 20.27-28 and Gaut. 22. 7-8 and 11 mention three more penances, but they are not independent ones ( as is made clear by Sankha). If a murderer, while undergoing the 12 years' penance, fights hin who attacks a brāhmana and saves him (or fights for the king, acc. to Vas.) or dies in the attempt, he becomes at once free from the sin and if he lives after the fight he had not to continue the penance for the whole period. The same applies to the saving of 12 cows by the murderer by putting his own life in danger219. Similarly, if a murderer fights a marauder depriving & brāhmaṇa of all his wealth and restores the wealth to a brāhmana or dies in the attempt or is severely wounded (thrice ace, to Yaj, Vas, and Gaut.) and is unable to restore the wealth to the brāhmaṇa he becomes free from the grave sin of brāhmaṇa murder,

Manu XI. 82, Yāj. III. 244, Sankha and Gaut, 22.9 lay down that if the murderer of a brāhmaṇa announces his sin when the king and priests have met together for the ceremonial bath after the Asvamedha sacrifice and being permitted by them bathes along with them, he becomes free from the sin.220 According to Haradatta this is an independent penance, while according to the Mit, on Yāj. III. 244, Aparārka p. 1057 and others it is not so but is to be performed while undergoing the 12 years' penance. 

Yāj. III. 245 provides that if the murderer treats and cures a brāhmaṇa or a cow (or cows ) lying helpless on the public road suffering from a long-standing and serious ailment he becomes free from the sin. 

Parāśara (XII. 65-67) prescribes for brahmahatyā the penance of going to the sea and Rāma's bridge, begging and declaring on the way one's sin, walking without an umbrella or shoes and residing in cowpens, forests, tirthas and river streams; on seeing the setu he was to bathe in the ocean and on return to feed brāhmaṇas at a dinner and to donate 100 cows to learned brāhmanas. 

There are other penances for brahmahatyā mentioned by Jamadagni, Atri, Kaśyapa and others quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1064-1065 ) and others which are passed over here for want of space. 

If a brāhmana killed his own father, mother, full brother, his teacher of the Veda, a brāhmana who has studied the Veda or has consecrated sacred Vedic fires, he had to undergo penance till his last breath (acc. to Pr. Prakarana p. 13 quoting Bhavisya purāṇa, Pr. V. pp. 70-71, Smrtimuktāphala Pr. p. 873 quoting Daksa III, 27-28 and Āp. Dh. S. 1.9.24). If a man killed a priest that was engaged at a soma sacrifice the penance was double (Yāj. III. 252 ). The Pr. Prakarana (p.13) says that this means that the murderer should perform 12 years' penance and then donate cows 221 in proportion to the difference between his

age at the time of finishing twelve years and 120 years ( which is regarded as the highest limit of life ). If a person strikes a brāhmaṇa intending to kill him but only injures him he should perform the vrata for brahmahatyā (acc. to Yāj. III, 252, Gaut. 22.11). The Mit, explains that this is an extension (atideśa ) of the rules about brahmahatyā and so the penance is a little less than the full one (i. e. 9 years ). Where certain sins are said to be equal ( sama ) to brahmahatyā or surāpāna, the penance for them is half of what is prescribed for the latter. If a person intending to commit suicide by entering water or fire or by hanging himself or by taking poison or by falling from a precipice or the dome of a temple or by cutting his belly with a weapon or by fasting, does not die, but luckily lives, he has to undergo a prāya citta for three years (acc. to Pr. Prakarana p. 15). Vas. 23. 18-19 and Parāśara XII,5–8 prescribe other prāyaścittas for such persons (who are styled pratyavasita'). Pr. Prakaraņa (p. 15) and Pr. V. (p. 75 ) quote two verses of Yama 221a for nine kinds of pratyavasita and prescribe Cāndrāyaṇa or two Taptakịcchras for them. " If a ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra intentionally and directly killed a brāhmana, the expiation was death, but otherwise each had respectively to undergo twice, thrice or four times as much prāyaścitta as a brāhmaṇa sinner would have had to undergo for killing a brāhmaṇa,222 Conversely, if a brāhmaṇa killed a ksatriya or vaisya or a südra the sin was only an upapātaka (acc. to Yāj. III. 236 and Manu XI. 66), unless the ksatriya or vaisya victim was engaged in performing a soma sacrifice (Šāmavidhāna Br. I. 7.5, Yāj. III 251, Vas. 20. 34) when the penance was heavy. Yaj. III. 266-267, Manu XI, 126-130 and Āp. Dh. S. 1.9.24. 1-4 prescribe other penances for killing a kṣatriya, a vaiấya or a südra. The penance for a ksatriya

killing a ksatriya is a little less (i. e. by :) than the penance for a brāhmaṇa killing a ksatriya. Vide the verse 'vipre tu sakalam deyam' quoted above (note 192). 

Women victims were placed on the same footing as ksatriya, vaisya and śüdra males (Yāj. III, 236 and Manu XI. 66), except the cases where the woman was an Atreyi or pregnant or in her monthly illness (Gaut. 22.17, Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24,5 and 9, Baud. Dh. S. II. 1.10, 12-13, Vas. 20.34, Viṣņu Dh. S. 50. 7–9) or the wife of a twice-born performing a soma sacrifice, when the penance was heavy (like the one for brahmahatyā). The period of soma-yāga was reckoned from the Dikșanīyā isti to the Udavasānīyā (acc. to the Mit.) or up to the end of avabhịtha bath (acc. to Aparārka). For killing women guilty of adultery the penances were higher and varied according to the caste of the paramour and of the woman (vide Gaut. 22,26-27, Manu XI, 138, Yaj. III. 268-269). 

Manu (XI. 208 =Viṣņu Dh, S. 54,30) and Yaj. III. 293 prescribe that for threatening to beat or strike a brāhmaṇa the penance is kịcchra, for striking him it is Ati-krochra, for shedd ing his blood a Krcchra and Atikrochra. The Sāmavidhāna Br. 1.7. 4 prescribes other penances (i. e, recitation of certain sāman texts ) for these. 

Gaut. 23,1, 22 Āp. Dh. S. 1. 9. 25,3, Baud. Dh, S. II. 1. 21., Vas. 20.22, Manu XI. 90-91, Yāj. III, 253 and Bphaspati prescribe that if a brahmana drinks intentionally spirituous liquor prepared from flour even once he has to undergo a pen ance that ends in death, viz, he has to drink that liquor boiling hot or to drink boiling hot cow's urine, milk, ghee, water or liquid cow-dung, and when his body has been completely scalded thereby and he dies he becomes free from that sin. Some like Haradatta on Gaut. 23. 1 hold that this horrible penance is meant for one who knowingly and repeatedly drinks surā (man ufactured from rice flour). Manu XI, 92 and Yaj. III. 254 prescribe another penance in place of the one ending in death viz. that the sinner should eat during one year (during three

The same rules apply to a ksatriya or vaisy a drinking surā (manufactured from rice flour). Only they have as stated above (in note 192) to undergo three-fourths and one-half respectively of the penance for a brāhmana sinner. This penance was to be undertaken after vomiting the contents of the stomach. According to the Madanapārijāta (p. 818), Pr. V. p. 104, Pr. Prakarana p. 43, Mit. (on Yāj. III. 24) and other works the twelve years' penance is meant for one who drinks surā (made from flour) through ignorance or force. According to Gaut. 23. 2-3, Yāj. III, 255, Manu. XI. 146, Atri 75, for drink ing intoxicants or human semen, ordure or urine through ignorance a person of the three first classes had first to undergo the penance called Taptakrcchra and then his upanayana was again performed. Vasistha 20.19 prescribes for drinking any intoxicant unintentionally the penances of Krcchra and Atikrochra, the drinking of ghee and the performing of upanayana again. There is great divergence of views about Manu XI. 146 and Yāj. III. 255 which is passed over here. Brhaspati 224 quoted by the Mit., Aparārka and others prescribes that a brāhmana who drinks surā prepared from raw sugar, flour and honey (or madhüka flowers ) should respectively undergo Taptakrcchra, Parāka and Candrāyana. This light penance is restricted acc. to the Mit, and others to cases where surā is drunk for curing a malady which no other medicine could cure. If a brāhmaṇa drank surā (not manufactured from flour ) or any other intoxicant, various easy penances were prescribed for him (such as undergoing Cāndrāyana on a river falling into the sea, feeding brāhmaṇas and donating a cow and a bull to the brāhmaṇas, Parāśara XII. 75-76). Vide Yāj. III. 255 and the Mit, thereon. Ksatriyas and vaisyas incurred no sin by drinking intoxicants other than surā (made from flour) and the sūdra incurred no sin even by drinking surā of the

paisti variety. The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 243 ) holds that since Manu XI. 93 generally forbids the drinking of surā on the part of brāhmanas, ksatriyas and vaiśyas the prohibi tion applies even to boys who have not undergone the rite of upanayana and girls who are not yet married and adds that for drinking surā the child has to undergo only one fourth penance (for 3 years ) if the offence was uninten tional and double of that (6 years) if it was intentional (vide also Pr. prakarana p. 48). The Kalpataru, it appears, held, relying on Gaut. II. 1 ('before upanayana a child may do as it pleases as regards behaviour, speech and eating '), that no sin (doṣa) was incurred by a child before upanayana and by a girl before marriage for drinking surā. The Pr. V. (p. 104 ) and Pr. Prakāśa criticize the Kalpataru for this view.225 As Brhaspati states (vide n. 188 above ) the license allowed by Gautama is limited by the Mit. and other digests to the par taking of sour or stale drinks and the like and is not extended to drinking surā which is a mahāpātaka. Jātākarṇya 226 ( q. by the Par. M.) provides that if a boy whose upanayana has not been performed drinks an intoxicant (madya) through foolish ness, his father, mother or brother should perform three krcchras as an expiation for him. Angiras (Jiv. p. 557), Apastamba smrti III, 9, Laghu-Harita 34-35, Brhad-yama III. 1-2 also provide that a pratinidhi ( brother, father, friend ) may undergo an expiation for a boy who is himself unable to do so or is less than eleven and above five years of age. 

The Asv. gr. (I. 22.22-26 )227 prescribes what is to be done and what is to be omitted in punar-upanayana. It provides that the rites of the cutting of the hair and the production of intellig ence are optional, there are no express rules about giving the person in charge (of the deities) and as to the time, and the verse to be recited as the Sāvitrī is Rgveda V. 82.1 instead of the usual Gāyatri (tatsavitur-varenyam, Rg.

Rules about punar-upanayana 

Vasistha 20.18 quotes Manu XI, 151 on this point 228 and Visnu (Dh, S. 51.4-5) in prose is to the same effect. Visnu (Dh. S' 51. 2-3 ) provides Cāndrāyana for drinking any of the twelve ) unclean excretions of the body (Manu V. 134 ) or any of the several kinds of intoxicating drinks and for eating garlic or onion or red garlic or any plant having a similar flavour or the flesh of village pigs, of tame cocks, of apes and of cows and then adds (in sütra 4) that they (the sinners ) must undergo fregh upanayana also. The smrtis provide different prāyaścittas for various lapses about drinking and eating such as drinking water from a pot which had already been used for holding surā, for drinking water from the water vessel of a candāla or of a washerman or from a südra's house or for drinking milk which should not be drunk (Gaut. 17.22-26, Yaj. I. 170, Manu V. 8-10), for eating forbidden food, which must be passed over here, because 229 they are too many and too various and depend on circumstances for their application as observed by the Pr. V. and because they are now of academic interest alone. Some reference, however, may be made to show how some of these lapses were treated. Sankha states that there are many articles that are allowed or forbidden to men, particularly to brahmanas and in cases of transgressions the decision rests with the sistas (the parisad of respectable people ). Brhaspati 230 (quoted by Aparārka) prescribes that in the case of the partaking of things that should not be licked or drunk or eaten or in case of taking in human semen, urine or ordure, the penance of a cāndrāyana is the purification. Some of the sages such as Samyarta, Sankha-likhita took a lenient view, prescribed Cândrāyana even for eating cow's flesh and human flesh. 231

(Vo. 

The general rule stated by the Sāma. Br. 1. 5.13, Manu XI. 160 and others is that one desirous of inner purity should not eat forbidden food, that if he eats it through ignorance he should make efforts to vomit it and if that is impossible he should quickly take some prayascitta (which is slight in the case of ignorance ). It may be mentioned that even from very ancient times exceptions were recognised to the prohibitions against the partaking of forbidden food. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad (I. 10 )282 narrates the story of Usasti Cākrāyana, who when the country of the Kurus had been devastated by hailstones (or by locusts ), begged (along with his very young wife ) of a chief eating beans and took from the latter the beans that had been put away for the chief (and so were ucchista), but when asked to take water for drinking meant for the chief replied that if he drank of it he would be drinking what was unclean, since he could get water whenever he liked. This Vedic passage indicates that even unclean things may be eaten when there is distress (ūpad) or danger to life, but that when there is no distress or danger even one who has knowledge of brahmavidyā should not violate the injunctions of śāstra about eating. The Vedāntasūtra (III.4.28) has an aphorism on this incident. Manu X.104 provides that he who, when in danger of losing his life, accepts food from any person whatsoever is not tainted by sin as the sky is not tainted by mud. Manu then refers (X.105-108) to the stories of Ajigarta who, when famished, approached for slaying his own son, of the sage Vāmadeva who when tormented by hunger desired to eat the flesh of a dog in order to save his life and did not sully himself, of Bharadvāja who when distressed by hunger along with his son in a lonely forest accepted many cows from the carpenter Vrdhu (Brbu ? ) or of Viśvāmitra who, well knowing what was right or wrong, proceeded, when tormented by hunger, to eat the haunch of a dog, receiving it from the hands of a Candāla 232a

Prāyaścittas for other Mahāpātakas 

101 

For eating the flesh of various birds Visnu Dh. S. 51. 29 and 31 and others prescribe fasting for three days or one day and also for eating several varieties of fish (Visnu 51,21). 

We may now revert to the penances for the other Mahā pātakas. It has already been seen how the thief that had stolen a brāhmana's gold of a certain weight was to approach the king with a club (p. 73 above). Even Ap. Dh, S. 19.25.4 refers to this and prescribes as an option (Ap. Dh. S. 1.9.25,6-7) entaring into fire as an expiation for theft or starving oneself by reducing the intake of food. Therefore, the penance for the theft of brāhmana's gold of the weight of 80 raktikūs or more (Manu VIII, 134 and Yāj. 1.363) was death for the offenders of all varnas, except a brāhmaṇa offender, who clad in rags (or bark. garment) was to undergo a penance in a forest for twelve years of the same kind as for brāhmana murder (Manu XI. 101 ) or for the drinking of surā prepared from flour (Yāj. TIL. 258 ). The offender may also give as much gold (if he is rich) as his own weight or as much wealth as would be required for the maintenance of a brahmana's family for the latter's lifetime (Yāj. III. 258 and Mit. thereon). The Āp. Dh. S. I. 9.25.8 provides the observance of the penance of Krechra for one year (as defined in Ap. Dh. S. I. 9.27.7-8) and quotes a verse "those who have committed a theft (of gold), drunk spirituous liquor, or had connection with a guru's wife, but not those who have slain a brāhmana, shall eat every fourth meal-time a little food, bathe thrice a day, pass the day standing and the night sitting; after the lapse of three years they cast off their sins."2328 The digests contain numerous and varying expiations for theft depending upon the weight of gold stolen, upon the qualities of the man robbed and of the thief, upon the caste of both upon whether it is a first offence or a repeated one, on the price and nature of the thing stolen and on the time and place and so on. Vide Pr. V. pp. 117-127, Pr. Sāra p. 49. Madanapārijāta pp. 828-834, Smrtyarthasāra pp. 108-109, Smrtimuktāphala pp. 883-885. These have to be passed over here for reasons of space. 

If the gold stolen (even from a brāhmana) was less than 80 raktikās or if gold of any weight was stolen from a ksatriya

or any other non-brāhmaṇa, the expiation would be as one for an upapātaka. Manu (XI. 162-168 =Matsyapurāṇa 227. 41-47) and Visnu 52. 5-13 prescribe various penances such as krochra for a year for the theft of corn or cooked food or wealth; cāndrāyaṇa for abducting men and women (slaves ) or for appropriating a field or house and the water of wells and cisterns; sāntapana for thefts of objects of small value; pañcâgavya for stealing eatables of various kinds or a vehicle or a bed or a seat or flowers or roots and fruits; fasting for three days and nights in the case of theft of grass, wood, trees, dry food, molasses, clothes, leather (or armour) and flesh; subsisting for twelve days on small grains of rice for stealing gems, pearls, coral, copper, silver, iron, bell-metal or stones; subsisting on milk alone for the theft of cotton, silk, wool, animals with cloven hoofs (cows &c.) or uncloven hoofs (horses &c.), birds, perfumes, medicinal herbs or a rope (used for drawing water). It must be remembered as stated above (p. 74) that the thief had to restore to the owner the thing stolen and then undergo a penance (Manu XI.164 and Visnu Dh. S. 52.14) and Medhātithi (on Manu XI. 164) adds that if he is unable to restore the thing (or its price) the penance is to be double. Besides, in certain cases of theft if corporal punishment or death was not inflicted by the king, the thief was fined eleven times the price of the thing stolen (Manu VIII, 321, 323, Viṣnu Dh. S. 5.82 ).233 

Steya (theft) is of two kinds, by force (such as robbery and dacoity and called sāhasa ) and by clandestine means. In the former case the penance goes on increasing (twice, thrice) according as the offender is a ksatriya or vaisya ( parṣadyā brāhmanānām, quoted above, Par. M. II part 1 p.231). In the case of theft by clandestine means if the owner whose gold or wealth is stolen is a brāhmana and the thief a ksatriya or vaisya, then also the penance must be higher than for a brāhmana thief (since, as, Nārada says in his chapter on sāhasa verse 16, the wealth belonging to idols, brāhmanas and kings is the best). But conversely, if the owner of stolen property is of lower class than the thief then the verse of Brhad-Viṣnu ( 'vipre tu sakalam deyam,' quoted above in note 192) will apply.

Penance for incest 

103 

The penance for incest with the guru's wife was prescribed from very ancient times as follows: Gaut. 234 23, 8-11, Ap. Dh. S. 1. 9.25. 1-2, Baud. Dh. S. II. 1. 14-16 (almost in the same words as in Gaut), Vas, 20, 13-14, Manu XI. 103-104 prescribe that the offender shall confess his guilt and then extend himself on a red-hot iron bed or embrace the red-hot iron image of a woman or having himself cut off his organ and testicles and having taken them in his joined hands may walk straight towards the south or south-west until he falls down dead and that he becomes purified by death. According to the Mit on Yāj. III. 259 the three are not distinct penances, but that two of them. viz, embracing the red-hot iron image of a woman and sleeping on a bed of red hot iron form one penance. The words of Yāj. no doubt convey that the two together are one penance ( viz. sleeping on red hot bed and clinging to a red hot image ). Others like the Madanapārijāta (p. 837), Medhātithi 235 on Manu XI. 103 do not accept this interpretation. The latter moreover relies on Gautama who employs the word 'vā' (or) in the two latter of his three sütras on this point. The Pr. V. (p. 138) points out this difference between Gaut. and Yāj. Manu XI. 58 and 170-71, Yāj. III. 231, Samyarta 159 regard sexual intercourse with a friend's wife or a maiden of a higher caste and the wives of one's son or of sagotras and women born of the same womb (sister &c.) or with an antyaja woman as equal to gurutal pagamana and the penance is only a little less than for the latter. Manu XI. 105 and Yāj. III. 260 prescribe a penance (other than one ending in death), viz. that the sinner should dwell in a tenantless forest, allow his beard to grow, should wear tattered garments and practise Prājāpatya Křochra for one year (three years acc. to Yāj.). The commentators say that this was meant where the sin was committed by mistake, Manu XI. 106 and Yāj. III. 260 provide another penance viz. Cândrāyana for three months, Manu prescribing that the sinner should subsist on sacrificial food (fruits, roots or nīvāra grain) or on barley gruel and Yăj, adding that he should recite for the three months the Vedasamhita. The commentators say that this applies in cases where the guru's wife is of a lower varna or of the sūdra class,

Parāśara (X. 10-11) provides three different prāyaścittas, viz. excision of the organ, three krcchras or three cândrāyanas if a man commits incest with his mother, sister, or daughter and in 

X. 12-14 prescribes other penances for adultery with other near female relatives. The Mit, on Yāj. III, 259 quotes Sankha for twelve years' penance for all four kinds of Mahāpātakas, which applies acc. to it to intercourse with guru's wife of the same class. It is not necessary to quote further smrti passages which vary greatly as to the extent of the penance. Manu XI. 178 ( = Visyu Dh. S. 53. 9 = Agnipurāṇa 169.41), Santi 165. 29 state that the sin which a twice-born man com mits by sexual intercourse for one night with a vrṣali 236 (a cāņdāla woman) is removed by him by the penance of subsist ing on alms for three years and reciting mantras (like the Gayatri). Ap. Dh. S, I. 9. 27. 11 has a somewhat similar verse about a brāhmana's intercourse with a sūdra woman237 Yāj. III. 233 prescribes for women death as a legal penalty and the same prāyascitta as for a male if a man has sexual intercourse with his paternal or maternal aunt, or daughter-in-law, maternal uncle's wife and others (enumerated above) with their consent. Manu XI, 175 ( = Laghu - Śatātapa 155 = Agnipurāṇa 169. 38) holds that a brāhmana, who has sexual intercourse with a candāla woman or mleccha woman or dines with cāņdālas or mlecchas or accepts gifts from them, has to perform penance as if he were patita if he unknowingly did these things, and be comes like them by committing these sins knowingly.

If a woman be guilty of a Mahāpātaka the general rule stated by Manu XI, 176 (latter half), Kātyāyana and Brhaspati238 was that whatever penance was prescribed for a male in cases of adultery with other's wives the same was to be adminis tered to women in case of adultery with males.

Prāyaścitta for adultereds 

105 

cular case the rule about half penance being prescribed for women did not hold good when a woman with full knowledge committed adultery and half penance was to be prescribed only where the adultery was through mistake. A similar rule was laid down by Angiras 238a If a woman became patita and did not undergo prayascitta she could be excommunicated by the process called ghatasphota (described in H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 615-616 and 1009). But there was a difference between a male and a woman in this respect. A woman, however, was not to be altogether abandoned on the street and left to fare for herself, though she be patita, but she was to be lodged in a cottage thatched with grass near the house and was to be guarded against further lapses and given bare maintenance ( enough to keep body and soul together) and (dirty ) clothes (Yāj. III. 296, Manu XI. 176). There were certain acts, however, which were specially condemned in women (Yāj. III. 297) viz. sexual intercourse with a man of a lower class, causing abortion and killing the husband. Vas, 21. 10 provides 239 that four classes of women may be altogether abandoned (and not given even starving maintenance &c.) viz, a woman who has sexual intercourse with (her husband's) pupil or with his guru or one who kills her husband or one who sexually approaches a man of a lower degraded class. Women, however patita they may be, were to be dealt with as stated in Yāj. III. 296 even if they did not perform any penance. Vas. 21.12 states that women of the brāhmana, ksatriya and vajśya classes, if guilty of sexual intercourse with a südra, can be purified by penanoe if they do not give birth to a child, but not those others (who give birth to a child born of the condemned connection). Vide H. of Dh VO). III. pp. 946-949 for penance and other matters in relation to adultery by men and women, 

It is now necessary to turn to the penance for association with those that are guilty of grave sins (mahāpātakas). Manu XI, 181, Viṣnu Dh. S. 54.1, Yāj. III. 261 provide that whoever associates with (for a year, acc. to Yāj.) a person guilty of one

of the four mahāpātakas has to undergo the vrata (the observ ances) prescribed for that grave sinner in order to free himself from the sin of association. Kullūka, the Pr. sāra (p. 61) and others state that the penance here referred to is the one for twelve years and not death since it is the word vrata that is employed by Manu and vrata does not ordinarily convey the idea of death,240 If the association was due to ignorance the penance was half. Vyāsa prescribed 211 for the knowing associator ths of the penance provided for the sinner himself. According to the Pr. V. (p. 171 ) there was no difference in the extent of the penance for association with a sinner in the case of a brāhmana 242 and a sūdra, though in other cases penance was reduced by one quarter for each varpa. If the association was for less than one year, then the penance was proportionately reduced. Not only was the patita condemned but even his son born after he became patita and he was excluded from inheritance. But the daughter of a patita was treated differently and she could be married without any stigma being attached to the husband. Vide Vas. 13.51-53, Yāj. III, 261, Baud, Dh. S. II. 1. 73–74, Hārita q. by Pr. V. p. 174 and Pr. prakarana p. 110 and H, of Dh, vol. III. pp. 614-616. 

Viṣnu Dh. S. (chap. 36) speaks of certain sins as anupātakas which are declared by Manu ( XI. 55-58) and Yāj. (III. 228-233) to be equal to or like one or other of the mahāpātakas and provides that those guilty of them become pure by Aśvamedha sacrifice or by resorting to pilgrimages. It has also been seen that such sins are removed by the penances that are slightly less (i, e. by 4th ) than those for the mahāpātakas themselves. 

The penances for upapātakas must now be briefly dealt with. The number of upapātakas is very large and it is of no practical importance to deal with each of them separately. First of all, some general rules about them will be stated and

a few of them that are of some importance will be dealt with individually. The Sāmavidhāna 243 Br. (I, 5.14) states that on committing several upapātakas a man becomes pure by reciting thrice the whole of the veda while fasting. Manu XI, 117, Yāj. III, 265, Visnu Dh. S. 37,35 prescribe that purification from all classes of upapātakas (except the sin of the avakirnin) is effected by the same penances that are prescribed for govadha or by cāndrāyana or by subsisting on milk alone for a month or by Parāka or Gosava. The digests prescribe that Parāka is meant for him who is strong enough to undertake it, Cāndrāyaṇa for him who is weak, Gosava for him who repeatedly commits the same upapātaka or is guilty of several at the same time ( vide Pr.

Govadha stands at the head of upapātakas in Manu, Yāj., the Agnipurāņa (168. 29-37). Several smrtis provide different penances for the sin of killing a cow. Gaut. 22. 18 prescribes 244 the same penance for govadha as for killing a vaisya (Gaut. 22. 15) viz. staying for three years in a forest, subsisting on alms, observing celibacy and donating, one hundred cows toge ther with a bull. In Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 26. 1 for killing a milch cow or a full grown ox the penance is said to be the same as for killing a sūdra. Vas. 21. 18 provides that if a man kills a cow he should cover himself with the raw hide of the cow (that is killed) and should observe Kịcchra or Atikrochra for six months, Manu 245 XI, 108-116, Visnu Dh. S. 50. 16-24, Sam varta 130-135, Parāśara VIII. 31-41 (q. in Smrtimuktāphala p. 875, prāyaścitta section) prescribə elaborate observances as penances for govadha. Yāj. (III. 263-264) provides four sepa rate prāvascittas, viz (1) the killer of a cow should control his senses for a month, should subsist on pañcagavya (cow's urine, Cow-dung, milk, curds and ghee), should sleep in a cowpen, should follow the cows so penned (by day) and at the end of a month donate a cow; (2) or he should perform Krochra penance while sleeping in a cow-pen and following cows by day; (3) or should perform an atikṛcchra in the same way; (4) or should fast for three days and donate ten cows together with

one bull. Sankha provides 216 that the killer of a cow should fast for 25 days and nights subsisting on pañcagavya, should tonsure his head together with the top-knot, should wear as an upper garment cow-hide and should follow cows, lie down in a cow-pen and donate a cow. Some of the smrtis and digests declare that the penance differed according as the cow that was killed belonged to a learned brāhmana or to a mere brāhmana by caste, to a ksatriya or vaisya or Sudra. For example, Devala (q. by Pr. V. p. 202) states that if a cow belonging to a brāh mana were killed, then the sinner should wear as upper garment that cow's hide for six months, should bring fodder for cows, should imitate cows, should subsist on barley gruel, should move among cows and then he becomes free from the sin. Šātātapa (q. by Pr. V. p. 203) states that one killing the cow of a vaisya 

uld subsist on pañcagavya for a month, should recito the Tomati-vidya247 and stay in a cowpen for a month,Visva mitra (Pr. V. p. 203) says about the killer of a cow belonging to a śūdra that he should undergo four kịcchras if he kills intentionally and two if unintentionally. The Gomati-vidyā as quoted by Aparārka (p. 1102), the Madana-pārijāta (p. 862) and Pr. T. p. 522 (which takes it from the Prāyaścitta section of the Kalpataru that takes it from Yama) is a laudation of cows: 'cows always emit fragrance, they have the smell of guggulu (bdellium), they are the support of beings, they are a great blessing; cows are (yield in their milk) the best food and the best offerings for gods; they are purifiers of all beings and offerings ooze from them; they please the gods in heaven by the offerings (of milk and ghee) that are rendered pure by the mantras recited over them ; in the agnihotra (keeping up the sacred fire) of sages cows help

to bring about homa; cows are the holy and eminent protection for all beings; cows are extremely holy and most auspicious; cows are blessed; salutation to cows that abound in wealth and are called saurabheyil salutation to the cows that are holy and the daughters of Brahmā. Brāhmaṇas and cows are really ) one family divided into two parts, in one (brāhmaṇas) reside the (vedic) mantras and in the other reside offerings (to Gods of ghee &c.:)." The Pr. prakarana 218 (p. 33) says that Katyāyana, Gautama, Samyarta, Parāśara and other sages prescribə differing penances for govadha, which are to be explained away by reference to the killing being intentional or unintentional or to the fact of the cow being owned by a brāhmapa engaged in a soma sacrifice or by a brāhmaṇa who has studied the Veda with the six auxiliary śāstras, or by the fact that the cow was useful for the homa of a brāhmana possessed of good qualities or was a pregnant cow or of the kapilā (brown or tawny) variety. It adds the important statement that in its days such cows being not found in ordinary life it is not necessary to expressly assign to each of those texts its appropriate subject matter, 

Yāj. III. 284, 249 Samvarta 137, Agnipurāņa 169,14 provide that if a cow or bull dies while being treated with medicine or while an attempt is being made to help the cow in delivery, or being branded (as a treatment) there is no sin. This applies as an exception in all cases of injury or death of brāhmaṇas, cows or other animals. Parāśara (IX, 4 ff.) and Angiras (q. by Pr. T. pp. 526-527) prescribe , and of the prāyaścitta for killing out-right a cow, if the death is due to putting an obstacle in the cow's or bull's free movement or to tying it up or to yoking it with thongs. Before undergoing a penance for govadha, the sinner had to make good the price of the animal to the owner, according to the Brahmapurana and Parāśara. 250

The Sāmavidhāna Br. (I. 7.8.) prescribes that on killing any animal (except a cow or bull) the guilty person should fast for one night and recite the sāmave da verse 'Agnis-tigmena' (1. 1. 3. 2). Āp. Dh. S. (1. 9.25.14) provides for killing a crow, a chameleon, a peacock, a chakravāka, hamsa, bhāsa, a frog, ichneumon, musk-rat, a dog the same penance as for killing a südra. Gaut. 22. 19-22, 24-25, Manu XI. 133-137, Yāj. III. 269-274, Visnu Dh. S. 50.25–32, Parāśara VI. 1-15 prescribe several penances for killing an elephant, a horse, a tiger, a monkey, a cat, a serpent and numerous other animals, which are passed over here. Some smrtis such as Samvarta 10 and Paithīnasi make a difference between grāmya and āranya (forest) animals, in each class seven being specificed by Paithinasi.251 The great concern of the sages for anything possessed of the principle of life or growth went so far as to prescribe the penance of reciting one hundred yk verses if a man cut off big trees (like mango or jack-fruit tree) or shrubs and creepers, except for purposes of sacrifices or agriculture 252 (Manu XI. 142, Yāj. III, 276, Vas. 19. 11-12). These provisions tended against wanton destruction of trees, shrubs and forests that are so beneficent to humanity and lend a charm to the landscape, 

It is remarkable that in case a man was bitten by a harlot or a monkey or an ass or by a dog or jackal or a camel or a crow he had to perform in addition to the pain of the bite) prānāyāma while standing in water and to drink ghee for purification (Manu XI. 199, Yāj. III. 277, Vas. 23. 31). Parāśara V. 1-9 prescribe elaborate rules of purification for bites by wolves, dogs and jackals (such as a bath and japa of Gāyatri &c.). 

PARADARYA (adultery with another's wife)-is a minor sin (acc. to Yāj. III, 235, Manu XI, 59). This excludes inter course with guru's wife and other intercourse declared to be like gurutal pagamana or with candāla women (Manu XI, 170-172, 175, 178, Yaj. III, 231-233, Vas. XX, 15-17 and XXIII, 41). Ap. Dh. S. I. 10.28.19 is very severe on a male adulterer who trans gresses his vow of loyalty to his wife; one who proves false to his wife shall put on the skin of an ass with the hair turned

outside and beg at seven houses saying 'give alms to him who played false to his wife'. This should be his livelihood for six months”. Conversely, Āp. (I. 10.28.20) provides that if a wife plays false to her husband she should perform for as many months (i. e, six months) the twelve night krochra penance, In another place Āp. Dh. S. (IL. 10. 27. 11) states that if a brāhmana commits adultery once with a married woman of equal class he shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for an outcast. Gaut. (22. 29-30, 34) provides penances for two years generally and three years if the woman be the wife of a learned brāhmana. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 265 quotes numerous texts dealing with the penance for adultery that does not amount to a mahāpātaka and tries to evolve order by assigning to each its proper province. This is passed over here. A woman guilty of adultery with a male of the same or higher caste than herself had to undergo the same penance as a male adulterer (Manu XI. 176 and Brhaspati), but if she committed adultery with a male of lower caste, then the penances differed as stated above (vide Vas. 21, 1-5 and Samvarta 167–172 ). Brhadyama IV. 48 states that adultery in the inverse order of classes is a grave sin, but adultery in the anuloma order of classes entails different penances for purification from it.253

The penances also such as the performance of Vrātyastoma and Uddalakavrata (Vas XI. 76-79, Gaut. 19.8) are prescribed by some of these works, while Manu XI. 191 (=Visņu Dh, S. 54, 26-27 = Agni purāṇa 170.8-9) prescribes a milder penance of three krcchras and then Upanayana is to be performed again. Vas, XI. 77 describes Uddalakavrata as follows: 'for two months he should subsist on barley gruel, for a month on milk, for half a month on āmiksā, for eight days on ghee, for six days on food obtained without begging or asking for it, for three days on water and he should observe a complete fast for one day.'

quoted in H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 379 appears to hold that even if generations before the great-grand-father of a man had been without upanayana, still proper penance should be prescribed and the man taken in the fold of Hinduism.

who follows his lust, svāhā; to Nirsti svāhā; to the deities called Rakṣis, svāha'. Gaut. 23. 17-19, Manu XI. 118-123, Baud, Dh, S. II. 1. 35-43; Yāj. III, 280, Agnipurāṇa 169. 15-18, Pār, gr. III. 12 contain similar provisions, Gautama adding that he shall beg for a year at seven houses with a red vessel (earthen) in his hand and proclaim his misdeed. The Baud, Dh. S. and Pār. gr. furnish elaborate details. The former states that the Pasupurodāsa may be offered to Rakṣas or to Yama or he may offer on the Amāvāsyā at night two offerings of clarified butter in fire after performing the preparatory ritəs of a darvi homa and that he may then invoke fire with the verse (Tai. Ā. II. 18) Sam mā ciñcantu marutaḥ &c.' (may the Maruts grant me long life and strength). 

If an ascetic reverted to the life of a householder, Samyarta (171-172) prescribes the penance of krochra for six months 257, Such a man is called pratyavasita. The pratyavasitas are said to be of nine kinds 258 by Yama (22-23), Bșhad-Yama (3-4) and others viz. those who turn back from water, fire, halter by means of which they wanted to kill themselves), those who revert back from the stage of sannyāsa or from a fast (unto death), or from poison, precipice or sitting dharnā and those who (desiring to commit suicide) strike themselves with a weapon (but are not killed); these nine are called pratyavasita and are beyond commerce with people, become pure by the penance of Cândrāyana or two Taptakrcchras. Vrddha-Parāśara quoted by Par. M. and Prāyaścitta-inuktāvali provides that sannyasins, who revert to the life of the householder, are to be treated as cā ndālas even after undergoing penance and their children born after they fall from the ascetic stage are to be made to dwell among cāndālas. This explains the harsh treatment alleged to have been meted to the great saint Jñānośvara and his brothers at Paithan in the 13th century. A person who after becoming a sannyāsin reverts to another āśrama or acts contrary to the

rules of his āśrama is called ārūąhapatita also (vide Par. M. II. part. I. p. 373 quoting Hārīta). 

Elaborate purifications are prescribed for removing the taint of touching certain men, unclean objects like bones (Manu V. 87), women in their monthly illness or within certain days after delivery and animals (like dogs, village pigs, cocks, crows ). They have to be passed over here for reasons of space. But a few passages may be cited by way of sample. Gautama 259 (14.28) provides that on touching patita, cāndala, a woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpse, or on touch ing any one who has touched any one of these or any one who is the third in contact, the purification is brought about by a bath with the clothes on. Manu V. 84 and Yāj. III. 30 contain similar provisions. The Pr. V. (pp. 495-499) discusses the question whether sparsa 260 (touch) means direct touch or includes even indirect touch and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that indirect touch also is included and cites āpastamba-smrti in support that if a brāhmana and a cândāla or the like are both seated on the same branch (without actually touching each other) the brāhmana can become purified only by a bath. A verse quoted as Yājñavalkya's by Pr. Prakaraņa 261 p. 110 (not found in the printed text) states: ‘on touching a cāņdāla, pukkaga, mleccha, bhilla, a pārasika (one coming from Persia) and the like and persons guilty of grave sins one should bathe with the clothes on.'

On touching a caitya tree (such as a fig tree round which a platform is built), a funeral pile (or brick altar prepared in the frauta rite called Agnicayana), a sacrificial post, a cândāla, one who sells the soma plant, a brāhmapa should enter water with the clothes on.' Samvarta 263 requires a dvija to sip water on touching a shoemaker, a washerman, a veņa (Manu X. 19, 49, one who beats drum &c.), a fisherman, a dancer (nata) and Śatātapa 264 provides that if any limb of a dvija (except the head) is touched by one who colours clothes, a shoemaker, a hunter, a fisherman, a washerman, a butcher, a thaka (Thug), an actor, one who allows sexual intercourse in the mouth, a dog, a prostitute allowing men of all varnas to visit her, an oil-grinder, the keeper of a tavern, an executioner, a village pig or cock, he should wash the limb with water and perform ācamana. If the head is touched by any one of these, then he should bathe. In this connection it may be noted that Hemādri quotes (on p. 38) the Garudapurāṇa and (on p. 316) Parāśara for the 16 castes in a village that were treated as cāndālas in the matter of touch, speech or sight. Devala (q. by Hemādri on prāyaścitta p. 312) says that Cāndāla and Turuska (Turk) are equally low. The chapter on untouchables in the 2nd vol. of the H. of Dh. pp. 165-179 may be consulted in this connection. On pp. 175-176 of the same work references are given to verses of Atri, śātātapa, Bphaspati and others stating that no purification is required on the ground of untouchability in the case of religious festivals and marriage processions, in battle, in the case of fire or invasion and similar calamities. By no stretch of imagination can these verses be restricted to the untouchability arising from death or birth as some propose

to do. The words are too sweeping for this explanation and there being no untouchability on birth for any one except the mother and persons in mourning not being likely to join religious festivals and marriage processions those verses cannot be so construed. 

The smrtis were very keen on keeping a high ideal before brāhmaṇas as regards receiving gifts. The Sāma. Br. (1.7.1-2) prescribes that if a brāhmana receives a gift from a ksatriya when not in distress (or difficulty) he should eat only one ineal by day for a month and recite the Sama verse 'mahat tat somo mahisascakāra' (Sāmaveda I. 6.1.5, 10, No. 542) for one month, while standing in water and if he accepts a gift from any one else from whom he should not accept it, he should undergo krochra penance and recite the sāma verse "trikadrukesu' (Samaveda 1.5.2.3.1, No. 457). Yāj. I. 140 provides that a brahmana should not accept a gift from a king who is parsimon ious (or greedy) and acts against the dictates of śāstra and Manu XI. 194 (=Vispu Dh. S. 54.24) provides that a brāhmana becomes free from the sin of the acceptance of a thing which should not be accepted or of the acceptance of a gift from a condemned donor by reciting the Gāyatri three thousand times (in a month) or subsisting on milk alone or staying in a cowpen for a month. It may be noted that Manu X. 102-103 and Yāj. III, 41 allow a brāhmaṇa when in distress to accept a gift from anybody or to take food from anyone whatever or to maintain himself by teaching any one whatever and state that he is not tainted by sin in so doing, since he is like fire and water (like that of the Ganges) and since it is unreasonable ( or impossible ) to assert that what is pure can be sullied. Manu X. 109, however, regards acceptance of a gift from an unworthy (or low) person as worse than teaching an improper person or officiating for him. A brāhmaṇa was not to sell things declared to be unfit to be sold by him such 264 a as sesame, oil of sesame, curds, bees' wax (ksaudra), salt, grapes, wine, cooked food, female or

male slaves, elephants, horses, bulls, fragrant substances, liquids, silken cloth (ksauma), black antelope hide, soma plant, water, in digo; by selling these he at once incurs sin. As penance he should practise Tapta-lercchra for a year after tonsuring his head, he should enter water thrice, wear only one wet piece of cloth, should observe silence, should practise the Virāsana, should sit up at night and stand by day, should recite the Gāyatri. 

One important matter dealt with by a few of the smrtis and some of the digests is the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those who were converted by force by the invading mlecchas. About the meaning of the word mleccha, there is some diver gence of views. From the Sat. Br. (III. 2.1. 23-24) it appears that the mlecchas spoke a degraded and corrupt speech (such as saying 'helavah' for 'hesrayaḥ'). Parāśara (IX. 36) refers to the mlecchas as the eaters of cow's flesh. The Pr. T. (p. 549) quotes a smrti 265 text to the effect that a mleccha is an eater of cow's flesh and talks much that is contradictory, and cites a passage from the Harivamśa for the manner of the dress and of the trimming of hair in the case of Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas. Pāradas, Pahlavas &c. Vide for mleccha and for the return to the Hindu fold of those that were forcibly carried away as slaves by mlecchas and robberg or made to kill cows or to eat the flesh of asses, camels, village pigs, H. of Dh. vol.

The Vispudharmottara 266 purana (II. 73.203-206) provides that when persons are kid. napped by mlecchas or raiders or persons passing through forests are so treated and return to their own country, the penances for purifying them from the sin of eating forbidden food are to be prescribed after considering their class (varna), viz. that a

brahmana should undergo half krcchra penance and should have the Upanayana performed again, a ksatriya should undergo three-fourths of Krechra (and also upanayana), a vaisya one fourth Krechra and a śūdra becomes pure by undergoing only 1 of a kịcchra and by making a gift. In view of the fact that Manu VIU, 169, Vispu Dh. S. VII. 6-7, Yāj. II. 89 declare that what is given by force, what is enjoyed by force and what is caused to be written by force and all transactions whatever that are brought about by force are void, and the burning desire of many people forcibly converted in times of disturbances to return to the Hindu fold and to the religion of their forefathers, the movement now called suddhi should be encouraged by all interested in the well-being and stability of Hindu society. It is better to call this return by the name of 'parāvartana'. A model but brief rite for the parāvartana of those who were forcibly converted or for those who voluntarily left the Hindu fold but want to return to it is given in the Appendix. The same prayoga with suitable changes may be employed for taking into the Hindu fold any one who was not born a Hindu. In ancient times such people appear to have been taken into the Hindu fold by the perfor mance of Vrūtyastoma. For this latter, vide H, of Dh, vol. II pp. 385-387 and for the spread of Hinduism in Java, Bali, Sumatra, Siam and other countries of South-East Asia, vide H, of Dh, vol. III, pp. 934-935. Recently, through the kindness of Dr. J. M. Unvala, I had an opportunity of reading several inscriptions of the 18th and 19th centuries at the fire temple called Jvālāji at Suruhani near Baku, the capital of Russian Azerbaijan, situated on the northern shore of the Caspian sea, which were inscribed by Hindu pilgrims or visitors, that begin with obeisance to Ganeśa and in one of which occurs the verse quoted below. 267 

Manu XI. 124 (= Viṣnu Dh. S. 38.7) prescribes the pon ance of Sāntapana for committing with full knowledge any of the deeds described above as jūtibhramsakara and the penance of Prājāpatya for doing it unintentionally. For doing any of the deeds called sankarikarana or apātrikarana described above, Manu XI. 125 prescribes the penance of candrāyana for a month and for doing any of the deeds called malāvaha prescribes that the perpetrator should scald himself with barley gruel for three

days. Those two verses of Manu occur in Agnipurāṇa (170. 23–25). Visnu Dh. S. (39.2, 40.2, 41.5) prescribes somewhat different penances for sankarikarana, apātrikarana or malini karaniya deeds. Vide also the Mit, on Yāj. III. 290 for the penances prescribed for these deeds by Yama and Brhaspati. About miscellaneous pūtakas the rule laid down by Manu XI. 209. Visnu Dh. S. 42.2, Yāj. III. 294 and others is that the penance should be prescribed by the brāhmaṇas after taking into account the nature of the deed, the ability of the perpetrator and other circumstances of time and place &c. 

Some of the digests prescribe certain times for the perform ance of periance. The first rule is laid down by Hārīta that having done something sinful or improper through trustfulness, affection, greed, fear or heedlessness one should resort to puri-- fication at once. Daksa 268 II. 73 also states that all nai mitlika and kāmya matters must be performed as they fall due and no delay should be caused. If more than a year is allowed to pass after the sin is incurred the penance would have to be double of what it otherwise would have been, according to Devala and Manu.268a The Pr. T. (pp. 474, 512) quotes a verse from the Vyavahāra cintāmani 269 and an astrological work to the effect that a penance or ordeal should not be administered on the 8th or 14th tithi of a month, nor should an ordeal or marriage take place on a Saturday or Tuesday. The Prayascittendusekhara (p. 15) says that according to respectable people (sistas) the sankal pa (declaration of undergoing a penance) should be made on the 14th tithi and the actual rite should be performed on the amīvāsyā. If the guilty person is in mourning he may perform penance after the period of mourning is over. 

The procedure for undergoing penances for sins and lapses prescribed by the assembly of learned men has varied in details from time to time. The Gaut. Dh, S. 26.6-17 prescribes

the method of performing Krochra penance. It is briefly as follows: The sinner desiring to be free of sin quickly should stand by day and sit up by night (i. e. should take sleep in a sitting position and not lie down), he should speak the truth and should not hold conversation with anāryas (südras &c.), should bathe thrice in the day, should perform mārjana (splash ing or sprinkling water on the head and other limbs by means of kuśas dipped in water after repeating sacred mantras) with the three verses 'apo hi sthā' (Rg. X.9.1-3), with the verses called Pavitravati and with the eight verses beginning with ‘hiranyayarņāh śucayah pāvakāh'(TaiS. V. 6.1.1-8). Then he should perform the tar pana 270 (satiating with water) with thirteen mantras beginning with namaḥ and ending with namah (each respectively containing 6, 4, 4, 13, 2, 2, 2, 6, 5, 2, 2, 6, 2 names of deities). This constitutes for him the worship of Aditya (the Sun) and he offers oblations of clarified butter with these thirteen mantras and, after he passes twelve days in this way, on the 13th he offers nine oblations of boiled rice to Agni, Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, the Visce Devas, Brahman, Prajāpati, Agni Svistakrt. Then he serves dinner to brāhmanas. The Āp. Dh. S. II, 6.15.9 states 271 the general rule that in all religious observances one should give dinner to brāhmanas that are pure (in conduct) and that have studied the Veda. The Baud. Dh. S. (II. I. 95-99) prescribes that in a kṛcchra penance one has to bathe thrice in the day, to lie down on the ground (not on a cot &c.), to wear only one piece of cloth, to shave one's hair on the head, the moustache and the body and to pare one's nails, and that the same mode is prescribed also for women (sinners) except the tonsure of the head. Manu (XI. 222-225 ) prescribes that in all penances there is homa with the mahāvyāhrtis every day, the sinner has to practise ahimsā (non-injury to all sentient beings), truthfulness, absence of anger and straight forwardness, has to bathe thrice by day and thrice by night together with the clothes on, he should not talk with women, südras and patitas, he should stand by day and sit down at night or if unable to do so he should sleep on the ground (raised platform called sthandila), should observe celibacy and the rules of a student, such as wearing girdle of muñja grass and carrying a staff (of palāśa &c.), should honour gods, brāhmanas and his status elders, should always recite the Gayatri and sacred texus

Procedure of penances. 

121 

Vas. 24,5 (a long prose passage) contains similar provisions. Yaj. III, 312-13 are very important. They prescribe the practice of certain virtues and rules of conduct called yamas (such as brahmacarya, kindliness, forbearance, truthfulness, ahiṁsā &c.) and niyamas (such as bath, silenca, fasting, purity of body &c.) as necessary adjuncts in all penances. The Laugaksigrhya (V. 3-11) prescribes the procedure for all penances. Yāj. III. 325 holds that one should, while performing the penance of krochra or cândrāyana, bathe thrice daily, recite holy mantras (as stated in Vas, 28.11-15) and should eat balls of rice over which the Gāyatri has been recited. Sankha272 (18,12-14) also summarises the different items that have to be gone through in undergoing a penance. The Madanapārijāta (pp. 781-784), Pr. V. (pp. 503 506), Pr, Sāra (pp 21,22 and 200-203), Pr. T. pp. 497-510, 523-524, Pr. Mayūkha pp. 18-21, Pr. Prakāśa (folios 38b to 43b), Prāyascittendusekhara (pp. 15 and 88) and other works provide elaborate rules about the procedure of undergoing prāyaścittas. It is not possible nor necessary to set out these in detail here. Briefly put, on the day previous to the actual day of commencing penance the sinner should pare his nails, shave his head, bathe with clay, cow-dung, holy water &c., drink clarified butter, make a declaration of performing the penance indicated by the assembly of learned men. On the next day he should bathe, perform śrāddha, drink pañcagavja, should perform homa, give dakṣiņā (gold, cows &c.) to the brāhmaṇas and feed them. Parāśara (XI. 3) says that at the end of the rite of penance pañca gavya should be taken and one, two, three or four cows should be donated respectively by a brahmana, a ksatriya, a vaisya and a südra. Yama (verse 63) says that brāhmanas should be fed on the performance of a penance and a daksiņā of one golden māsa should be given to each brāhmana. Jābāli says that at the beginning and close of all penances the sinner should offer in the smārta fire oblations of clarified butter to the accompani ment of the Vyāhrtis, perform srāddha and offer daksinā con gisting of a cow or gold. Vide Aparārka (p. 1230) and Par. M IT part 2 p. 195 for Jābāli's verses. The Pr. Prakasa (folio 30a) adds that according to the Mahārnava the number of vyāhrti-homas should be 28 or 108,

A few words may be said about the tonsure of the head (vapana or mundana). The Tai. Br. (I.5.6.1-2) states273 : . The Asuras first shaved the hair on the head, then the moustache and then the armpits; therefore they went down (or with face down wards) and were defeated, while the gods first shaved the armpits, then the moustache and then the hair on the head.' The Pr. Prakāśa quotes this passage in a mutilated form and then states that vapana is of three kinds, daiva (of the gods ), āsura (of the asuras) and manusa (of men), that the lasura method is condemned, that in consecrating the Vedic fires, in the ištis and soma sacrifices the daiva method is ordained, while in prāyaścittas, there being no special vidhi, there is an option. Tonsure of the head is enjoined on several occasions e. g. the Viṣnupurāṇa provides : 274 "Tonsure should be carried out at Prayāga when on a pilgrimage, and on the death of one's father or 

mother; one should not in vain (lightly ) tonsure the head'. To these occasions may be added penances. The idea seems to have been entertained that whatever sin a man commits it becomes centered in the hair, as a verse quoted by the Madanapārijata and 

Pr. M. states. 275 Gaut.(277.3), Vas. 276 (24.5), Baud, Dh. S. (IL1.98-99) and others provide for the tonsure of the hair on the head and lips (except those on the eye-brows, the hair on the trunk and the top knot). Exceptions were introduced to the rule about tonsure. Daksa 277 forbade tonsure, the offering of pindas and the carrying of a corpse and all funeral rites to

Tonsure in penances

one whose father was alive and to a man whose wife was pregnant. But this prohibition did not apply to penances. The Baud. Dh. S. already referred to prohibits the tonsure of women in penances. Angiras 163, Āpastamba-smrti I. 33-34, Brhad-Yama IV.16, Vrddha-Hārita IX. 386, Parāśara IX. 54-55. Yama 54-55 provide 278 that in the case of married women whose husbands are alive and in the case of maidens all their hair should be held together and only two finger-breadths of hair should be cut off, In the case of widows and ascetics the entire head was to be shaved. It was further provided by Parāśara (IX 52-54), Sankha (q. by Par. M. II. part I, pp. 290-291) that in the case of a king or prince or a learned brāhmana tonsure of the head should not be insisted upon, but that they should have to undergo double the usual penance and the daksinā would have to be double, 279 The Mit on Yāj. III. 325 quotes a verse of Manu 280 (not found in the printed text) 'tonsure of the head is not desired in the case of learned brāhmanas and kings except in the case of those guilty of mahāpātakas, of cow-killing or of being an avakirnin'. The Mit. (on Yāj. III.264) further quotes Samvarta 281 to the effect that when the penance prescribed is only a quarter then only the hair on the body below the throat is to be shaved, when half is prescribed then in addition the hair on the lips is to be cut, when three-fourths then all the hair on the body except the knot is to be cut and in the case of the full penance all hair including the sikhā (the top-knot) also are to be cut off. The Par. M. (II part 1. p. 300) while describing cāndrāyana penance requires the cutting of the hair on all parts

of the body (including private parts), 282 The tonsure is to be performed by a barber and yet the sankalpa is 'vapanam kariṣye' and not 'vapanam kārayiṣye': From Gaut. 27,3 (vapanam vratam caret) prescribing tonsure in cāndrāyana Haradatta and others infer that vapana is unnecessary in krcchra penance. 

Baths that are subsidiary to prāyascitta are performed with ashes, cow dung, clay, water, pañcagavya and water in which kusa grass has been dipped. Mantras that are to be recited at the time of bath are laid down in the Linga-purapa, the Bhavisyapurāṇa and elsewhere. 

There are certain virtues to be cultivated as being common to all prāyaścittas whether secretly or openly undergone. They are called yamas and niyamas and have been set out above (p.121) from Yāj. III. 312-313. Atri (verses 48-49) sets them out somewhat differently. Manu IV, 204 (= Atri verse 47 ) refers to yamas and niyamas which Medhātithi explains as follows: viz. yamas are in the nature of prohibitions (e. g. a bıāhmana should not be killed), while niyamas consist of what is to be done (such as one should always recite the Veda, as in Manu IV. 147). 

While undergoing prāyaścittas certain rules about food and other matters were to be observed. For example, Hārita 283 prescribes that the person undergoing penance should omit on all days māṣa and masüra pulse, honey, taking food at the house of or belonging to others and sexual intercourse, should not speak at an improper time, should perform ācamana if he speaks with women or sūdras or those who are ucchiṣta. Yama ordains that one who is undergoing a penance should omit massaging the body or head with oil, the chewing of tāmbūla, applying unguents and every thing else that causes one to feel strength or sexual passion, 

According to the Pr. 281 Prakāśa when undertaking a penance one should begin with the mantra 'Agne vratapate

vratam cariṣyāmi' (On Fire, lord of vratas! I shall perform a vrata) and when finishing a penance one should repeat the mantra 'agne vratapate vratam-acārisam tad-asakam tan-me rādhi' (01 Fira, lord of vratas; I have performed the vrata, I had the strength to do it, may it be propitious for me &c.'). 

Prāyascittas are of two kinds, prakāśa (undergone openly ) and rahasya (undergone secretly). A few words must be said about the latter. Gaut. ( 24.1-11), Vas. ( 25.1-3), Manu XI, 248-265, Yaj. III. 301-305, Visnu Da. S. 55 and other smrtis lay down rules about secret prāyaścittas. Where a man's 285 sin is not known to anyone except himself he may perform secret expia tion. In the case of adultery and in the case of association with one guilty of a grave sin, one may still perform a secret penance, even though the adultery is known to the adulteress and even though the man guilty of a mahāpātaka is aware of the association. Vas. 286 25.2 states the general rule that secret penances are meant for those who have consecrated the Vedic fires, who are disciplined, old or learned and that the openly undergone penances are meant for others. If such a man is himself aware of the proper penance, he should perform it with out going to an assembly (parsad ), but if he is not so aware he may consult some knowing parson privately, asking him in a general way what the penance for a particular sin may be. Vas, 25.3 provides that those who are always intent on prānāyāmas, holy texts, gifts, homas and japa are released from sin. Manu XI.226 states that those whose sins have not become public may be purified by homas and mantras. Even women and südras can perform penance in secret, since, though they cannot perform homa and repeat Vedic mantras, they can, as the Mit, on Yāj. III.300 says, perform expiation by means of gifts and prānāyāmas. Gaut. 26.2 and Manu XI. 253 prescribe that one who desires to receive a gift which he should not accept or who receives such a gift should recite in water (navel-deep according to some) the hymn of four verses beginning with 'tarat

(Vol. 

sa mandı ' (Rg. X.58.1-4). For ons who is guilty of brāhmana murder Gaut. ( 24.6) prescribes that for the first ten days he should subsist on milk alone, on clarified butter for a further ten days, on water for another period of ten days, that he should partake of the articles specified only once in the morning, should wear wet clothes and should offer every day eight symbolic homas with clarified butter, of his hair on the body, nails, skin, flesh, blood, muscles, bones and marrow with the words 'I offer in the mouth of Death' added at the end. 287 Yāj. IIL 301 prescribes that the murderer of a brāhmana should fast for ten days, should recite the Aghamarsana hymn (Rg. X 190 ) while submerged in water, donate a cow yielding milk, while Vispu prescribes that he should bathe for a month in a flowing stream or river, should perform every day 16 prāṇāyāmas, should eat only once a day sacrificial food and may then become purified. Viṣnu provides that the drinker of surā becomes pure by observing the vrata ( as stated ) for brāhmana murder and reciting Aghamarṣaņa; while the thief of brāhmana's gold becomes pure by fasting for three days and reciting the sacred Gāyatri ten thousand times and one guilty of incest by the repeated recital of the hymn beginning with 'sahasrasirṣā' (Rg. X. 90). 

The sages observed that some of the penances mentioned in old smrtis were terrible and involved loss of life. Therefore, gradually more humane and easier penances came to be prescribed. For example, Harita 288 states "brāhmaṇas who have studied dharmaśāstra should prescribe a penance appro priate to the age, the time and the strength of the brāhmaṇa (sinner), the penance being such that he may not lose his life and yet may be purified; one should not prescribe an observance that will cause great distress ( to the sinner). Angiras also says that the parṣad should indicate the penance resolved upon by all the members which would not cause loss of life. Sankha

declares : 289 a brāhmana should never practise the performance of a penance in a forest full of thieves, ferocious beasts, elephants and other animals through fear of injury to life. The body that is the all in all (i. e. the only source ) of (the obsery ance of) dharma must be protected with efforts; just as water oozes down from the mountain, so dharma springs from the body'. 

to OFTE As times changed easier substitutes (called pratyāmnāyas) were found and prescribed. The word pratyāmnāya was used in this sense in the Ap. Sr. S. V. 20.18 (yadyanādhyo-gnin adadhita kāmam-evaikām gām dadyāt sā gavām pratyāmnāyo bhavatiti vijñāyate), 6. 30.9 and Sān. Sr. S. 14.51.6 and other sūtras. Saṁvarta 290 states that if a sinner is unable to undergo the Prājāpatya penance, he may donate instead a cow yielding milk and if he cannot donate such a cow he may donate the full price of such a cow. Parāśara 291 (XII. 63-64) provides four substitutes for a Prājāpatya penance viz. the recital of the famous Gāyatri mantra (Rg. III, 62.10) ten thousand times or 200 prāņāyāmas, or bathing twelve times in a sacred watery place after drying the head on each bath, or taking to a journey of two yojanas towards a holy place. From the words of Gaut. 19.16 and 18 (quoted above in note 120) it follows that gold is a substitute for a cow by way of penance. The Brahmapurāņa 292 provides that in the absence of a cow a niska or half niska

or a quarter niska may be given. The Caturviinsatimata 293 provides several pratyāmnāyas for Prājāpatya viz. recital of Gayatri ten thousand times, standing in water, gift of a cow to a brāhmaṇa-these four (including Prājāpatya) are equal, as also a thousand homas with sesame, recitation of the whole samhita of the veda, feeding twelve brahmanas, Pavakesti are equal. The Caturvimśatimata 294 stated that one should substitute the gift of one cow for Prājāpatya penance, of two cows for Sānta pana, of three cows for Parāka, Tapta-krcchra and Ati krcchra and eight for Cāndrāyana. The result was that from medieval times at least even in the case of mahāpātakas there was a sliding scale of penances ultimately ending in feeding brāhmaṇas or making monetary or other presents to them. For example, the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 326) says that in the case 295 of the twelve years' penance, optionally 360 prājā patyas could be performed, each prājāpatya extending over twelve days, that if a man was unable to undergo this he should donate as many (i.e. 360) milch cows, if that was impossible he may donate their price or 360 niskas or even half or quarter thereof &c. Yaj. III.309 provides (a lakh of) homas with sesame to the accompaniment of the Gayatri or making brahmanas recite the Veda by the gift of sesame. Vas.28.18-19 (=Atri VI. 7-8) and Visnu Dh. S.90.10 state that by feeding seven or five brāhmaṇas on the Full moon of Vaišākha with sesame and honey a man becomes free of all sins. These provi

Method of pratyāmnāya 

129 

sions are maintained in almost all medieval works such as the Smrtyarthasāra pp. 149, 155, Prayascittasāra p. 203, Pr. T. pp. 517, 541, Pr. Mayükha p. 18 &c. The same method is followed in penances for lesser periods. It is due to this provi sion in the smrtis that in modern times men, when on death-bed, perform prāyaścittas for all their sins by donating a cow or more or by monetary presents to priests.295a 

Some interesting sidelights are thrown on the prices of milch cows, cows and bulls by the medieval writers. The Pr. V. (p. 199 ) states that the price of a milch cow (payasvini) was 3 purāṇas, that of an ordinary cow (go) one purāṇa and that of a bull was five purāṇas. The Pr, T. (pp. 517-18 ) quotes Kātyāyana to the effect that the price of a cow (go) is 32 paņas and that of a male calf one purāņa, that a paņa is copper weighing 80 raktikās or equal to 80 varātakas ( cowries ), that 16 paņas were equal to one purāṇa (following Bhavisya and Matsya purāṇas), that by niṣka is not meant the one indicated by Manu (VIII, 137) but a dināraniska i. e. gold weighing 32 raktikās. The Prāyascittendusekhara p. 7 follows Yāj. 1.365 and holds that niska is silver equal (in weight) to four surarnas or a pala. A raktikā weighs on an average 1.8 grains; so a copper pana of 80 raktikās would weigh about 144 grains. Therefore a dhenu was equal to 32 panas (or two purāṇas) i. e. about 26 tolas of copper (one tola being taken as equal to 180 grains). Vide H. of Dh. vol. III pp.120-121 notes 161 and 162 for information about ancient coins and their weights. There appears to be owing to lapse of centuries some difference in the views of several writers. According to Vijñāneśvara four suvarnas are equal to a silver niska. According to the Lilāvati 20 varātakas are equal to a kākini, 4 kākinis are equal to a pana and a niska is equal to 256 panas. 

295a. There was a parallel to this method of pratyāmnāya in Europe as remarked by Gibbon A year of penance was appreciated at 26 solid of silver, about four pounds sterling, for the rich, at 3 solidi or nine shitki nga PD for the indigent; and these alms were soon appropriated to the Churer which derived from the redemption of sins an inexhaustible source o nome opulence and dominion' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. pertrah Institute p. 187 (Smith's ed, of 1862).

CHAPTER V NAMES OF ALL PRĀYAŚCITTAS 

Now all the prāyascittas mentioned in the smrtis and digests will be arranged in alphabetical order (Sanskrit, transliterated into English), excepting mere hymns, fasts, &c. and brief explanations and references will be added to each. 

AGHAMARSANA-( The hymn Rg. X.190.1-3). 

This is prescribed as a penance for all sins by even the most ancient Dharmaśāstra works such as Gaut. 24.11, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 2.19-20, Vas. 26.8, Manu XI.259–260, Yāj. III.301, Vispu Dh, S. 55.7, Sankha 18.1-2 and others. They prescribe that if a man recites (for three days, according to Haradatta ) the Agharmarsana hymn thrice in the day while immersed in water for a bath, he is freed from all sins and that this penance is equal in sanctification to the bath at the end of the Asvamedha sacrifice. The Pr. Sāra p. 199 speaks of the Aghamarṣana vrata. He has to fast for three days and stand up by day and sit up by night and donate a milch cow at the end, Sankha 18.1-2 and Visņu Dh. S.46.1-9 prescribe the details. 

ATIKRCCHRA-Vide under Krcchra. Manu XI. 213 prescribes that this penance is constituted by eating only one morsel of food for three days in the morning only, for three days in the evening only, for three days eating one morsel got without asking for it and observing a complete fast for the next three days. Yāj. III.319, on the other hand, prescribes the eating of just as much food as would fill the hand (and not merely one morsel). The Mit., Pr. Sāra (p. 176 ) and others state that the rule of Manu applies to those who are able to undergo it, while that of Yāj. is meant for those who are unable (asakta). The Sāmavidhāna Br. 1.2.6-7, Gaut. 26.18-19, Visnu Dh, S.54.30, Laugāksigțhya V.12-13, Parāśara XI.54-55, Vas. 24.1-2, Baud. Dh, S. IV.5.8 also speak of this. Manu XI, 208 ( = Visnu 54,30 ) prescribes this penance for striking a brahmana with a weapon or a cudgel. Gaut. 26,22 states that this penanca purifies a man of all sins except the mahāpūtakas, 

ATISANTAPANA-See under Mahā-sāntapana. This is variously defined. According to the Agnipurāņa 171.10 and Usnu ji Dh. S. 46.21 it lasts for 18 days (3 times of the Maha-sāntapaita in which for six days one has to subsist on cow's urine and five

131 other things). The Mit on Yāj. III. 315 quotes a verse of Yama according to which this penance lasts for 12 days. 296 The Pr. M. (p. 23 ) speaks of it as lasting for 15 days. 

ARDHAKROCHRA-See under Krcchra. According to the Āpastamba-smrti 9.43-44. this is constituted by taking food only once in the day for one day, only once in the evening for one day, taking food for two days without asking for it and completely fasting for two days 297 (in all six days). The Mit. quotes another variety of it, viz. subsisting for three days on food obtained without asking for it and thereafter observing a complete fast for three days. 

AŚVAMEDHAVABHRTHASNANA- the ceremonial bath in the sea or a holy river at the end of an Aśvarnedha sacrifice. Visnu Dh. S. 36 (last verse) prescribes for those guilty of mahāpātakas and anupātakas the Asyamedha sacrifice. It is only an emperor or a crowned king who is entitled to perform an Aśvamedha, at the end of which comes a ceremonial bath. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II, pp. 1228-1236 for a description of the Aśvamedha. According to Pr. V. p. 65 only a ksatriya could perform Aśvamedha and so this bath was a penance for him alone. But according to Kullūka (on Manu XI. 92) and Pr. T. (both quoting a verse from Bhavisya-purāṇa) even a brāhmana could participate in the bath at the end of the Aśvamedha and become free from the sin of brālimana murder if committed unintentionally. 298 

AGNEYA KRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāṇa and Vispudharmottara if a man subsists for twelve days on sesame alone that is āgneya Krcchra. 299 Vide also Pr. Pr. (folio 48 b.) 

296. यदा तु षण्णां सान्तपनद्रव्याणामकैकस्य द्वन्यहमुपयोगस्तदाऽतिसान्तपनम् । यथाह यमः। एतान्येव तथा पेयान्यकैकं तु द्वन्यहं द्वन्यहम् । अतिसान्तपनं नाम श्वपाकमपि Tra il gê I ANT. ON T. III. 315, 17. FT. p. 191, sur p. 1234 (reads NË STET).

[Vol. 

RSICANDRAYANA-According to Brhad-Visnu quoted by Pr. Prakarana p. 132 this penance requires that one should take only three mouthfuls of sacrificial food every day for a month. 300 

EKABHAKTA-According to Pr. Pr. (folio 48a) if one takes for a month only one meal a day it is ekabhaktaka. 301 

KRCCHRA-This is the general word for several penances. The Sāma. Br. (I.2 1) starts 302 by saying 'we shall now expound three krcchras' and adds that one should eat sacrificial food for three days only by day and eat nothing at night, then for three days more one should eat at night only, then for three more days one should not beg or ask for food from others and should then observe a complete fast for three days. If he is in a hurry to purify himself he should pass the day standing and the night in a sitting posture. Gaut. (26.2-16) describes the procedure of the first Krochra (called Prājāpatya by later writers ), then Atikrcchra (26.18-19), and then Krcchrātikrcchra (26,20). Baud. Dh. S. (II.1.91 ) speaks of Parāka as Kịcchra. Āp. Dh. S. (1.9.27.7) describes the Krcchra penance of twelve days. The Kịcchra penance described by Gaut. 26.2-16 is one for twelve days and is called Prājāpatya by Manu (XI 211), Sankha (18.3), Yaj. III 319 and others. Laugāksi Gr. (5.3-11) describes Krcchra. According to the Par. 303 M. (II. part 1 p. 30) and Pr. Pr, (folio 64a ) the word Krochra without any qualifying epithet (upapada) means Prājāpatya. The Pr. T. (p. 481 ) states that the Krcchra described by Gaut. (26.1-5) is given the name of Prājāpatya by Manu (XI. 211). Besides the rules about the intake of food, Gaut. prescribes certain other observ ances viz. speaking the truth, not holding conversation with

Yaudhājapa', bathing thrice in the day in the morning, the noon and the night, then performing mārjana 304 ( sprinkling of of water) with the three verses beginning with 'Apo hi stha' (Rg. X.9,1-3), with the mantras called 'pavitravati' viz. those beginning with 'pavamānaḥ suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. I 4.8.1) and the eight verses beginning with 'Hiranyavarnāh' (in Tai. S. V. 6.1), he should perform tarpıņa with water with 13 mantras (Gaut 26.12 ); he performs the worship of Aditya (the sun) with the same mantra (i.e. after tar pana with the 13 mantras, he is to perform the worship of the sun with the same thirteen mantras ) and offers oblations of clarified butter with the same 13 mantras and then on the 13th day he cooks boiled rice and offers oblations into ordinary Agni (svāhā' added at the end of each, such as ' agnaye svāha), Soma, Agni and Soma, Indra and Agni, Indra, Viśve devāḥ, Brahman, Prajāpati and Agni Sviṣtakrt and then feeds the brāhmaṇas. 

Krechra-samvatsara-Ap. Dh. S. I. 9.27.8 speaks of this as a penance in which Krechras are undergone continuously in a cycle for one year. 

Krcchrātikscchra-Gaut. 26.20 and Sāma. Br. I. 2.8, Vas. 24,3 define it as a krochra where only water is drunk on those days on which food is allowed and Gaut. 26.23 and Sāma. Br. I. 2. 9 state that this penance frees a man from all sins, 305 Yāi. III, 320 ( = Devala 86, first half ) and Brahmapurana q. by Pr. Pr. (folio 40 a) prescribe that in this one has to subsist on water alone for 21 days. This difference between the views of Yāj, on the one hand and of Gaut. on the other is reconciled by the digests by saying that the period depends on the capacity of the sinner. According to Pr. Pr. (folio 46b) and Aparārka p. 1238, Yama prescribed a krcchrātikrochra for 24 days.306 Vide Par.

M. II part 1 p.179 and Madanapārijāta p.716. According to Manu XI. 208 (= Visņu Dh. S. 54.30 ) when a person strikes a brāhmana with a weapon and draws blood, he has to undergo this penance. The Pr. Prakarana (p. 15 ) states that for those unable to undergo Krcchra, one milch cow is a substitute, for Atikịcchra two milch cows and for Kệcchrātikrcchra four. 

GOMūTRA-KROCHRA–The Pr. Sāra p. 187 quotes a verse about this: one should make a cow eat to satiety grains of wheat mixed with barley and then may collect the yava grains that are to be found in her dung and then drink the gruel of those yavas cooked in cow's urine. 307 

GOVRATA- Pr. Prakarapa (p. 132) quoting the Mārkandeya describes this as follows: One should bathe with cow's urine, should subsist on cow-dung, should always stand among cows, should sit down on cow dung, should drink water only when cows have drunk water; one should not eat when they have not eaten, should stand up when they stand, should sit down when they sit down. This should be continued for a month. 

CANDRAYAN A-The word is derived in this way. That rite, where there is action by means of increase and decrease (in the intake of food) in imitation of the course of the phases of the moon, is cāndrāyana. 308 The word occurs in Păn. V.1. 172 (pārāyana-turāyaṇa-cāndrāyanam vartayati). From very ancient times Cāndrāyana has been divided into two varieties, called Yavamadhya 309 (lit. being large in the middle like a grain of yava, and therefore tapering or thin at the ends) and Pipilikāmadhya (lit, having a middle like that of an ant, that is, slender in the middle and large at the ends). Baud. Dh.S. III. 8. 33 names these two varieties. According to Jābāli 310 there are five

varieties of Cândrāyana viz. Yavamadhya, Pipilikāmadhya, Yaticāndrāyana, Sarvatomukha and Siśucāndrāyana. These will be described later on. Yājñavalkya says (III, 326) that where no specific penance is prescribed in the smrti texts, cândrāyaṇa effects purification and cândrāyana may be undergone not as a penance but for the purpose of accumu lating merit and that in the latter case (when performed for a year) the performer enjoys the happiness of going to the world of the moon after death. 311 Manu XI. 221 and Gaut. 27.18 state the same view about cāndrāyana for accumulating merit. When the vrata of cāndrāyana is performed for the sake of merit, there is no tonsure (vide Gaut. 27.3 'vapanam vratam caret' and Haradatta thereon). Gaut. 19.20 (= Vas. 22. 20) prescribes that Kịcchra, Atikrochra and Cāndrāyana are the same penance for all sins (collectively for grave sins, for lesser ones separately, according to Haradatta and others ). Compare Manu V. 21 and XI. 215 (=Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5. 16). Manu XI. 27, Yāj. IUI, 323, Vas, 27.21, Baud, Dh, S. IV.5.18 and others define Cândrāyana (of the Yavamadhya type ) as follows: On the first day of the bright half of a month only one morsel of food ( grāsa or pinda) is taken, on the second tithi two and so on; on the full moon (Paurnamāsi) 15 morsels are taken; then on the first of the dark half 14 morsels, one being reduced on each succeeding day. So on the 14th of the dark half only one morsel is eaten and on the Amāvāsyā there is a complete fast. Here in the middle of the month of thirty days the largest number of morsels is taken (and so this is Yavamadhya) just as on the Paurnamāsi day the moon becomes full and begins to wane from the next day. Here Paurnamāsī is in the middle of the period of the observance as Visnu Dh. S. 47.6 says. If one begins the vrata on the first tithi of the dark half, he reduces one morsel on the 1st i. e. takes 14 morsels on that day, 13 on the 2nd tithi of the dark half and so on. On the 14th of the dark half he eats one morsel and on the amāvāsyā he eats nothing. Then on the 1st of the bright half he takes one morsel and goes on increasing the intake till on the Paurnamāsi he takes 15 morsels. The month is taken in this latter case to be Pūrnimānta. Here in the middle of the observance there is no food taken and a large number of morsels is taken at the beginning and at the end. So this is called Pipilikamadhya. This latter is described by Vau3745

and Manu XI, 216. Vispu Dh. S. 47.5-6 say: Yasyāmamāvāsyā madhye bhavati sa pipilikā-madhyah yasya paurnamāsi sa yavamadhyah. If there are 14 or 16 tithis in any particular paksa (half of a month ) then the number of grāsas must be regulated accordingly. There are other descriptions of cândrāyaṇa. Vide Haradatta on Gaut. 27.12-15. The Kalpataru appears to have held ( explaining two verses of Jābāla) that on the first of the dark half of a month 15 morsels were taken, then one morsel less was taken on each succeeding tithi; so that on amāvāsyā one morsel was eaten, then on the first of the bright half two morsels were eaten and one morsel was added every day so that on the 14th of the bright half fifteen morsels were taken and there was a complete fast on Paurnamāsī. But this seems to be opposed to the very idea of increase and decrease of the intake of food on the analogy of the waxing and waning of the Moon and to several smrti texts such as Vas, 23.45 and Parāśara X. 2. Therefore the Pr. Prakāśa (folio 58b ) finds fault with it. 311a. Cândrāyana may be divided from another point of view into two varieties : (1) MUKHYA (in the primary sense, viz. following exactly the waxing and waning of the moon) and GAUNA (having a secondary or metaphorical sense ). The former is either yavamadhya or pipilikā-tanu madhya ), while the latter is of four kinds, viz, sāmānya, rsi cāndrāyana, śiśucāndrāyana and yaticandrayana. The last two will be described later. The Sāmānya (or sarvatomukha) consists in eating only 240 morsels of sacrificial food in a month of 30 days, distributing them according to one's choice (not necessarily in imitation of the phases of the moon) as stated by Manu XL220, Baud. IV.5.21, Yāj. III, 324 and the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 324), the Madana-pārijāta and other works. Here the penance, though it is not regulated by the phases of the moon, is called Candrāyana for the purpose of prescribing the same procedure and observances in it as in the Cândrāyana which follows the phases of the moon. Here the Mimānsā rule of Kupdapāyinām-ayana applies, 312 From th words of Gautama

27.12-15 it appears that he envisaged a cāndrāyaṇa of 32 days (pipilikāmadhya) or 31 days, when he says that the performer should fast on the 14th of the bright half, eat fifteen morsels on the Full Moon day, then reduce it by one morsel, so that there is a total fast on the amāvāsyā and then on the first of the bright half one morsel is taken until on the full moon 15 morsels are taken. Thus from the 14th of the bright half ( when there is a complete fast ) to the full moon of the succeeding month there are in all 32 days and the penance is of the pipilikā-madhya type. 

As regards the size of the morsels, different views are expressed. Gaut. 27.10 and Visnu Dh, S. 47.2 prescribe that the size of a morsel shall be such as not to cause a distortion of the mouth (while swallowing it). Yāj. TII, 323 allows that the morsels may be as large as the egg of a peahen, and Parāśara X.3 313 prescribes the size of a hen's egg and Sankha that of an undried āmalaka fruit ( myrobalan). The Mit. explains that Gautama's words apply to boys and young people and that the other sizes confer an option according to the capacity (sakti) of the man undergoing penance. The procedure of cāndrāyana is described in Gaut, 27.2-11, Baud. III.8, Manu XI. 221–225, Věddha-gautama chap. 16 and other works. The one given by Gautama, being pro bably the oldest among Dharmaśāstra works, is here set out. 

The general rules prescribed for the Krechra penance in Gaut. 26.6-11 are applicable to Cāndrāyana also. If it is performed as a penance the performer must tonsure his hair and observe a fast on the day preceding the Full Moon. He offers libations of water, oblations of clarified butter, consecrates the sacrificial food and worships the moon, reciting apyāyasva' (Rg. I. 91, 17), ‘san te payāmsi' (Rg. I. 91.18). He shall offer clarified butter, reciting the four (ks) beginning with 'yad devā devahedanam' (Vāj. S. 20,14 or Tai. Br. II. 6. 6.1). These

four together with the preceding are seven oblations of clarified butter that have to be offered. At the end of the offering of clarified butter he shall offer pieces of sacred fuel while reciting the (eight) texts beginning with devakrtasya' (Vāj. S. VIII. 13). Each mouthful must be consecrated by (mentally ) reciting one of the 314 following words 'om bhūḥ, bhuvah, syah, tapaḥ truth, fame, prosperity, vigour, refreshment, strength, lustre, brightness, soul, dharma and siva' 315; or he may consecrate all of them at once saying 'adoration! svāhā'. The sacrificial food must be one of the following: boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley, grain separated from the husk, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, sour milk, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. Among these each succeeding one is preferable to that enumerated earlier. 

JALA KRCCHRA-See under Toyakrochra, 

TAPTAKRCCHRA-There is great divergence of views about this penance. Manu XI. 214, Vas. 21.21, Viṣnu Dh. S. 46. 11, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5.10, Sankha-smrti 18,4, Agnipurāṇa 171. 6-7, Atri verses 122-123, Parāśara IV.7 speak of it as of 12 days' duration comprising four periods of three days each. In this one drinks hot water, hot milk, hot ghee for three days each and then for three days there is a complete fast when he inhales hot vapour or atmosphere (acc. to Manu XI. 214). Manu adds that the performer has to bathe only once (and not thrice as in some other penances) and that he should practise self-control. Yāj. IIT, 317 (= Devala 84) speaks of this as of four days' duration, viz. he takes hot milk, hot ghee and hot water for one day each and observes a total fast on the 4th day. The Mit. on Yāj. ITI, 317 calls this mahātapta-Korcchra and also mentions a taptakrochra of two days, viz, on the first day the sipner takes all the three, viz, hot water, hot milk and hot ghee and observes a total fast on the 2nd day. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 50a) remarks that the authority for the two days' taptakịcchra spoken 

314. Haradatta says that on the days when the performer eats less than fifteen morsels, the counting is to be from the beginning and the later mentioned texts must be left out and that, while eating, the performer must employ the Prāņāhuti mantras, viz. 'prāņāya svāhā, apānāya svābā' etc

The penance Taptakrcchra 

139 

of by the Mit, has to be found out. The Pr. Prakāśa refers to a tapta-krcchra for 21 days. It may be said, as done by the Pr. Prakāśa, that the penance of tapta-krcchra for twelve days is meant for great sins and that the one for four days is meant for lesser sins. The quantity of water, milk and ghee, that was to be taken is laid down by Parāśara 316 IV. 8, Atri 123-124 and Brahmapurāṇa (q. by Pr. V. p. 511) viz. that hot water, hot milk and hot ghee should be six palas, three palas and one pala respectively. The Brahmapurāṇa adds that water, milk and ghee are to be taken respectively in the evening, morning and noon. 

TULĀPURUSA KRCCHRA-Jābāli speaks 317 of the duration of this penance as eight days; Sankha (18.9-10) and Visnu Dh. S. 46.22 describe one of ten days where oil-cake, the foamy scum of cooked rice, butter-milk, water and barley meal are to be eaten, each respectively on one day, followed by a fast on the next day. Yāj. III. 322 (= Atri verses 129-130) describes one of 15 days where the above five ingredients are eaten for three days each. Yama on the other hand speaks of Tulāpurusa for 21 days, when the five things are separately eaten for three days (vide Mit on Yāj. III, 322). Aparārka pp. 1239-1241, Par. M. II. part 2 pp. 184-189, Madanapārijāta pp. 718-727, Pr. Sāra pp. 179-181 set out at length the mode of the performance of Tulāpurusa as a penance. In this penance two images of the performer made of fragrant uśīra grass were to be prepared and placed in the pan of a balance a span high made either of gold or silver or sandalwood and were to be weighed against pebbles and placed in another pan and worship was to be offered to Mahādeva and Umā and many other subordinate deities such as Agni, Vāyu, the sun.

TOYA-KRCCHRA-This is also called Varuna-krochra by Yama (q. in Pr. Prakāśa, folio 48 a) and by Sankha (q. in Pr. Sara p. 182). Visnu Dh. S. (46.14) states 318 that subsisting on nothing but ground barley mixed with water for one month is called Udakakrcchra. Since Varuņa was regarded as the lord of waters even from the times of the Rgveda (e.g. in Rg. VII. 49. 3) and to mark the truth and falsehood among men, this Toya krochra was called Vāruņa. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 47 b)319 quotes Jābāla to the effect 'If a sinner remains immersed in water for a whole day and night without taking food and recites mantras (addressed to Varuna) he removes by the jalakrcchra the sins which he may have committed for a year. According to Yājña valkya (q. in Pr. Sāra p. 187) this penance consists in observing a fast for a day and night standing up the whole day and passing the night without sleep in water and reciting the next day the sacred Gāyatri mantra 1008 times. According to Sankha (q. by Madana-pārijāta p. 737) this penance is constituted either by subsisting on lotus stalks grown in water or on saktus boiled in water.

of only rice gruel, barley gruel, vegetables, milk, curds, ghee each for a period of three days in succession and then should observe a complete fast for three days; this is called Devakrta (performed by the gods ) penance and destroys all sins. It was practised by the Maruts, the Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas. By the power of this penance they became free from rajas (impurity). Thus this penance lasts for 21 days. The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 48 b) refers to another variety of it and quotes a long prose passage on it, which is passed over here for want of space. 

DHANADAKRCCHRA-See under Vāyavya-krochra. According to the Viṣnudharmottara 322 (q. by Pr. Prakāśa) this penance consists in subsisting for a month on food just sufficient to fill the extended but hollowed palm, mixed with gold (i. e. in which gold is rubbed or boiled). 

NITYOPAVĀSA KROCHRA-The Pr. Prakāśa (p. 48 a) states that this is constituted by a man eating only twice in the day (in the morning and evening ) for six years and not drink ing even water between the two meals. 323 

PANCAGAVYA-For the various details connected with pañcagavya prepared from cow's urine, dung, milk, curds and ghee, vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 773-774. Pañcagavya is to be offered into fire with the mantras 'Trāvati' (Rg. VII. 99.3), fidanı Visnur' (Rg. I. 22, 17), 'mā nastoke' (Rg. I. 114, 8), 'Sam no devir' (Rg. X. 9. 4) and then the remainder is to be drunk. It is to be drunk with the middle of a sprig of three Palāśa leaves or with a lotus leaf. Manu. XI. 165 ( = Agnipurāņa 169. 30) prescribes this drinking of pañcagavya as the penance for petty thefts. Similarly, Yāj. III. 263 prescribes that one guilty of killing a cow should drink pañcagavya for a month. The Mit on Yāj. III. 263 quotes Viṣņu to the effect that one who kills a cow should perform one of three penances, viz. drinking three palas of pañcagavya every day for one month or undergoing the penance of Parāka or Candrāyana, 324 Though Viṣnu 54. 7 and Atri (verse 300 ) state that a brāhmana

drinking surā and a südra drinking pañcagavya both went to hell (Mahāraurava, according to Visnu), yet Devala (verse 61) and Parāśara XI. 3 and 27 and medieval works like the Pr. M. (p. 13) and Sūdrakamalakara (p. 42 ) allowed śūdras to take pañcagavya without Vedic mantras. And women of all varpas, being treated like śūdras for certain purposes, were also allowed optionally to do the same. 

PATRAKRCCHRA-Vide Parna-kūrca below. 

PARAKA-Manu XI. 215 (= Baud. Dh. S. IV.5.16), Yāj. III. 320 (= Sankha 18.5 = Atri 128), Agnipurāņa 171, 10, Viṣnu Dh, S. 46. 18 and Br. 325 prescribe that this penance is constituted by not taking any food for twelve days, while the performer controls his senses and remains vigilant, and that this penance removes all sins. 

( PARNAKURCA-This is a more severe type of patra krochra. Yāj. III. 316 (= Devala 83) and Sankha-Likhita 326 define Parnakịcchra as one where the leaves of palāśa, udumbara, lotus, and bilva are boiled separately on each day in succession and the decoction of each is drunk on each day separately and then water in which kuśas have been dipped is drunk. Thus parnakrcchra is a penance of five days. The Mit. on Yaj. III. 316 quotes a verse of Yama to the effect that when a sinner fasts for three days and nights and thereafter he drinks together the decoctions of all the four and kusa water on the same day then the penance is called parmakūrca. The Par. M. (II, part 2 p. 181)327 regards Parnakūrca as a variety of Parna krochra. Vasistha, Jābāli and Atri (116-117) make Parņa krcchra a penance of six days by adding the leaves of Aśvattha to the five mentioned above. Viṣnu Dh. S. 46.23 mentions another variety of Parpakrcchra for seven days. 328

PARNAKROCHRA-Vide Parpakūrca above. 

PADAKRCCHRA-According to Yāj. III. 318 (=Devala 85) this is defined as a penance where a sinner takes food one day only once by day, only once by night, then once only (by day or night) but without asking for it from any one (a stranger, a servant or even his own wife) and observes a total fast for one day. Thus this penance lasts for four days. There was differ ence of view as to the number of mouthfuls to be eaten, Āpastamba (q. by Mit. on Yāj. III. 318) saying that the mouth fuls are respectively 22, 26 and 24 when food is taken only once in the evening or morning or without asking for it, while Parāśara states the number of mouthfuls to be 12, 15 or 24 respectively when food is taken only at night or in the morning or without asking for it. The Caturvimsatimata (q. by Par. M. TI part 2 p. 172) puts them as 12, 15 and 10 respectively. 

PĀDONAKROCHRA--This lasts for nine days 329 only instead of the 12 days of the Prājāpatya and in it one eats by day only for three days, eats food once only for three days with out asking for it from any one and observes a complete fast for three days (i. e, three days when food is eaten by night only are omitted here). 

PUSPAKRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāņa 171. 12 and the Mit, on Yāj. III. 316 (quoting Markandeyapurāṇa) this penance is constituted by drinking for a month the decoction of flowers boiled in water, 330 

PRASRTA-YĀVAKA or PRASRTIYAVAKA-- Visnu Dh. S. chap. 48 and Baud. Dh, S. III, 6 contain elaborate descrip tions (which agree with each other in many respects almost verbatim) and so does Hārīta (q. by Par. M. II. part 2 pp. 192 194) who has many sūtras and verses in common with Visnu and Baud. Prasrti means the hand with all fingers stretched out, the palm being hollowed. The yavas taken out were as many as could be placed on the palm of the hand thus stretched

out and hollowed. Some passages from Baud, who is probably the oldest of the three authors may be set out here. 331 "Now if a man feels his conscience heavy with bad actions committed by himself, let him boil for himself, when the stars have risen, a handful of barley and prepare gruel with that. Let him not perform (the Vaišvadeva) offering with (a part of) that nor a 

Bali. 332 offering. Let him consecrate the barley before it has been placed on fire, when it is being boiled and after it has been boiled with the following mantras thou art barley, the king of grains, thou art sacred to Varuna and mixed with honey, the sages have declared thee to be an expeller of all sins and a means of purification. Then there are five verses more invoking the barley grains to purify the performer from all sins whether due to deeds, words, or thoughts, to destroy distress and evil fortune, to free him from the food of ganas (guilds or multitudes of men), harlots, Sudras, or food offered at sraddhas by persons in impurity due to birth or death, food of a thief, food at navasrāddha (i. e. on 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th days after death) or from dreadful mortal sins or from guilt against children and guilt due to serving in a royal court, from sin of stealing gold, sin of the violation of a vrata or sacrificing for an unworthy person and sin of speaking ill of brāhmaṇas. Then Baud. proceeds “while the barley is being boiled he should guard it and recite Adoration to Rudra, lord of created beings; pacified

is the sky'. He should recite the text beginning with 'Krpusva pājah' (Tai. S. I. 2. 14. 1), the five sentences beginning with 'Ye devā' (Tai. S. I. 8.7. 1), the two texts 'mā nastoke' (Rg. I. 114, 8 and Tai. S. III, 4, 11, 2) and 'Brahmā devānām (Rg. IX. 96.6, Tai. S. III, 4. 11.2). “Then having sipped water he should eat a little of the boiled food after pouring it into another vessel. Let him offer it as a sacrifice to the soul reciting 'ye devā' (Tai. S. 1. 2. 3.1).” 

Then Baud, prescribes: "one desirous of wisdom must perform this rite for three days and nights. A sinner who drinks it during six days becomes pure, he who drinks this during seven days becomes purified from the mahāpātakas, he who drinks during eleven days removes even the sins conmitted by his ancestors. But he who during 21 days drinks gruel of barley grains which have passed through a cow (i. e. cowdung) sees the Gañas, the lord of the Ganas, the goddess of learning and the lord of learning." 

PRAJAPATYA-Vide under Krcchra above where it is shown that the word Krochra without any qualifying epithet means Prājāpatya. Manu XI. 211, Yāj. III. 319, Visnu Dh. S. 46. 10, Atri 119-120, Sankha 18. 3, Baud. Dh. S. IV.5.6 mention the word Prājāpatya and define it. This Prājāpatya has several varieties. The first is that described by Manu XI. 211 and Vas. 21. 20 viz. four periods of three days each following one another in which there is respectively eating once only by day, once only by night, eating once only without asking for it and complete fast. The second is that described by Vas. 23. 43. where on the first day food is taken only by day, on the 2nd only at night, on the 3rd day food got without asking for it is taken and on the 4th a complete fast is observed and where the same process is repeated for two periods of four days each. The first 333 is called Prājāpatya by 'sthānavivrddhi' and the 2nd is called 'Dandakalita'. Further, both these are said to be made kānulomyena' (by the proper and straightforward order). If the sequence described above is reversed i. e. if for three days there is first a total fast, then subsisting for 3 days on food got without asking for it, then for three days eating at night only

and for three days eating by day only, it is Prājāpatya by ‘prātilomya'. Further it may be performed with recitation of Vedic texts or without (for women and śūdras).334 

PHALAKRCCHRA-Subsisting on fruits alone for a month. Vide the passage from Markandeya quoted above (n. 330). Srikịcchra mentioned below will be also phalakrcchra. The fruits of Bilva and of Amalaka and lotus seeds were the only fruits to be employed and they were to be eaten only for bare subsistence. 

BALAKRCCHRA-See Siśukrcchra. 

BĶHAD-YĀVAKA-The Pr. Pr. (folio 49 a) quoting Brahmapurāṇa describes it as follows:-One should feed cows on plenty of yavas anointed with clarified butter. Then he should mix water with the dung of those cows and take out the grains of barley which are voided by them after eating them. He should then dry them in the sun, should grind them on a clean stone and cook them mixed with sesame and anointed with ghee in cow's urine on a fire brought on an altar. He should place the boiled holy grains in a vessel of gold or in a cup made of palāśa leaves and present them to the gods and manes and he may eat them. He should carry this on for twelve, twenty-four or thirty-six years for the removal of all sins. This is prescribed as a penance for killing one's guru, brother, friend or a near relative &c. 

BRAHMAKŪRCA-The Mit. 335 on Yājñavalkya III, 314 states that when a man fasts on one day and on the next day mixes up the ingredients of pañcagavya with Vedic mantras and drinks it with mantras it is called Brahmakurca. According to Sankha cow's urine is taken with the Gāyatri (Rg. III. 62. 10), cowdung with the mantra 'Gandhadvārām' (Tai. A. X. 1), milk with 'ā pyāyasva' (Rg. I. 91.16), curds with dadhikrāvno' (R.IV. 39. 6), ghee with Tejosi' (Vāj. S. 22. 1) and Kuģa water with devasya tvā! (Vāj. S. 22. 1, Ait. Br. 37. 3 &c.). Jābāla 336

prescribes that when a man observes a fast for the whole day and night on a day and particularly on a Full Moon day and then drinks pañcagavya the next morning this is called the rite of Brahmakūrca. Parāśara (XI. 27-28) appears to hold that Pañcagavya and Brahmakurca are synonyms. The Madana pārijāta p. 729 and Pr. Sāra. p. 189 state that the Sāntapana described by Yāj. (III. 314) is styled Brahmakūrca.337 

BRAHMAKROCHRA- Vide Hemādri's work on Prayascitta p. 964 quoting Devala and Markandeya. It is a penance for 12 days on each of which one has to drink in the noon Pañcagavya in a temple or cowpen after offering it with mantras in fire; one has to contemplate on Viṣnu till the evening and should sleep near an idol and give up tāmbūla and unguents.

MAHASANTAPANA-Sāntapana, according to Yāj. III. 314, Manu XI, 212 (=Baud. Dh. SIV.5.11 =Sankha 18.8=Bshad Yama I. 13), Atri 117-118, Visnu Dh. S. 46.20, lasts for two days; on the first the sinner drinks together cow's urine, dung, milk, curds, ghee and kuśa water and on the second day he fasts altogether, Mahāsāntapana penance consists, according to Lau gāksigrhya VII. 3, Yaj. III. 315 (=Devala 82 = Atri. 118-119), in drinking separately for six days in succession the six ingredients mentioned above and fasting on the next day (i. e. it lasts for 7 days). According to Sankha 18.9, Baud, Dh. S.IV.5.17 and Jābāla338 the Mahāsāntapana lasts for 21 days, each of the six ingredients referred to above being taken for three days and a fast being observed for three days. Yama speaks 339 of a mahāsāntapana for 15 days viz. when each of cow's urine, dung, milk, curds and ghee is taken as subsistence for three days consecutively.

MAHEŚVARA KRCCHRA - Vide Hemādri (on Prāyaścitta ) p. 961, which sets out a passage from Devala, that states that Brahmā prescribed it for Maheśvara on the burning of Madana, In this penance in the after-noon one should carry a broken jar (kapāla) and beg at three houses of learned brāhmanas for vegetables, offer them to God and eat them and should sleep in the evening near an idol. After getting up the next day he should donate a cow and drink pañcagavya. 

MULAKRCCHRA-Visņu Dh. S. 46. 15 340 states that it is so called when one subsists on lotus stalks alone and the Mit. on Yāj. III, 316 quotes Mārkandeya to the effect that one must subsist on mulas (edible roots) alone. 

MAITRAKĶCCHRA-The Pr. Prakāśa (folio 341 53 a) mentions it. Its peculiarity is that in the Sāntapana on the third day milk of a kapilā (tawny) cow is to be partaken of. The same work notes that the Kalpataru states that this is a sāntapana in which on the first day all the six ingredients (cow's urine &c.) are taken followed by two days of fasting. 

YAJŇAKRCCHRA-This is a penance for one day laid down by Angiras (q. by Pr, Sāra p. 183, Smrti-muktāphala p. 939) as follows: The sinner should bathe thrice, should be self controlled and silent; and after the morning bath he should recite the sacred Gāyatri 1008 times together with om and the Vyāhrtis at the beginning. When reciting he should be in the Virāsana 342 posture. He should drink cow's milk only once either sitting down or standing or curds of cow's milk (if he cannot secure cow's milk) or butter-milk or barley gruel mixed with cow's urine (in the absence of milk, curds or butter milk). This one-day penance called Yajña-krechra removes all sins.

YATICĀNDRAYANA-Manu XI. 218 (= Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5.20), Agnipurāṇa 171.4, Visnu Dh, S. 47. 7 define 343 it as a penance where the sinner eats only eight inouthfuls of sacri ficial food only once in the noon for a month and exercises control over himself. 

YATISANTAPANA-When the ingredients 344 of Pañca gavya are mixed together (with kusa water) and drunk for three consecutive days it is Yati-santapana according to the Mit. on Yāj. III. 314. The Pr. Prakarana p. 128 adds that the three days must be followed by a fast for one day. 

YAMYA.-According to Visnudharmottara-purana quoted by Pr. Prakāśa (folio 48 b) this consists in subsisting for a month on saktu grains found in cowdung. 

YAVAKA-Sankha 345 (18.10-11) states that partaking of boiled yavas obtained from cowdung for a month is the Yāvaka penance for destroying all sins. The Par. M. and Pr. Prakasa quote a prose passage from Devala, 346 according to which the penance may last for seven days, a fortnight or a month and which states that the procedure of Prājāpatya will apply to this penance. 

VAJRA-Atri 164 defines 347 it as a penance, where barley grains fried in clarified butter and mixed with cow's urine are partaken of.

VAYAVYA-KRCCHRA-According to the Agnipurāṇa 318 and Visnudharmottara this penance consists in subsisting for a month every day on food that will just fill the extended palm. 

VRDDHAKROCHRA-VRDDHI-KROCHRA-This is a penance for eight days, according to Sankha-Likhita 319 and Yama, in which one takes food only by day for two days, only by night for two days, without asking for food for two days and fasts for two days. 

VYASAKROCHRA-This is the same as Maitra krochra, 350 for which see above p. 148. 

SISUK RCC HRA-also called Bālakrochra by Sankha Likhita and Pādakrochra by Devala and Prāyascittamuktavali (folio 10 a) and is the same as Laghu-krcchra,351 It lasts for four days, eating once only in the day, eating once only by night, eating food got without asking for it only once on one day and fast on one day. Vide Vas. 23,43 (q. by Haradatta on Gaut. 26.5), Baud. Dh, S. II. 1. 92. Yāj. III. 318. 

ŠIŚU-CĀNDRĀYAN A-Manu XI, 219, Baud. Dh. S. IV. 5.19, Agnipurāṇa 171.5 state that when a brāhmana eats (for a month) four mouthfuls in the morning and four after sun-set, that is Sisu-cāndrāyana (cāndrāyaṇa for boys, old men &c.). 

STTAKROCHRA-This is the reverse of Taptakrochra, as here all the articles are to be taken when they are cold 351a and not hot (as in Tapta-krcchra ). Vide Visnu Dh, S. 46.12, Agni purāṇa 171. 7 and Mit. on Yāj. III. 317. According to Visnu quoted by Pr. Sāra (p. 185) and Madana-pārijāta (p. 736) this is a penance for 10 days (and not for twelve days as the Mit. states), viz. cold water, cold milk and cold ghee are drunk three days each and there is a total fast for one day.

ŚRĪKRCCHRA-According to Visnu Dh. S. 46.16, Agni purāņa 352 171.12 and Mit, on Yāj. III. 316 (quoting Mārkandeya) this is constituted by subsisting on Bilva fruit or lotus seeds or āmalaka fruit for a month. The Madanapārijāta (p. 737) quotes a verse of Sankha to the same effect. 

SANTAPANA-Vide Mahāsāntapana and Atisāntapana above. It is of five kinds, viz, the first for two days, the 2nd for seven days, the third for twelve (Atisāntapana), the 4th for 15 days and the fifth for 21 days. 

SURACANDRAYAN A--The Agnipurāņa defines it as one where somehow or other (and not in a rising or falling scale) a man partakes of 240 morsels of food in a month. Yāj. III. 324 speaks of it as a variety of Cāndrāyana. Viṣnu. Dh. S. (47, 9) calls it'sāmānyacāndrāyana'.353 

SUVARN A-KRCCHRA-Vide Hemādri on Prāyaścitta pp. 969-972 quoting Devala and Mārkandeyapurāṇa, in which a varāha or a half of it or quarter of it had to be donated. A Varāha was equal to nine rūpakas and a rūpaka was one māṣa of five guñjas (of silver it seems). For killing a brahmana secretly or for the guilt of incest one had to perform ten thousand or 40 thousand suvarna-krcchras and a lesser number for various other lapses. 

SOMAYANA-According to the Madanapārijāta pp. 744 746 (quoting Hārītadharmasūtra and Mārkandeya) and Pr. Prakāśa (folio 60b) the penance lasts for thirty days divided into five periods of 7,7,7,6, 3 days, in which the milk, of all the four udders of a cow, of three udders, of two udders and of one udder is respectively drunk and for the last three days there is a complete fast. There is another variety which lasts for 24 days from the 4th tithi of the dark half of a month to the 12th of the bright half of the next fort-night; the 24 days are divided into eight periods of three days each; in the first four

SAUMYAK RCCRA-According to Yāj. III. 321 this penance lasts for six days, in the first five of which one sub sists in succession upon oilcake alone, foamy scum of boiled rice alone, butter-milk alone, water alone and saktus (barley ) alone and on the last day a total fast is observed. The Mit., Madanapārijāta p. 717, Pr. Sāra p. 178 and other digests state that one has to partake of the five ingredients in quantities just sufficient to keep body and soul together. Jābāla (quoted by the Mit., Par. M. II part 2 p. 183 and others) makes it a penance of four days' duration, in the first three of which one partakes successively of oilcake, saktus and butter-milk and observes a fast on the 4th day. Atri (128-129) also mentions it. The Pr. Prakāśa (quoting Brahmapurāṇa) speaks 354 of another variety of six days' duration, on the first of which there is a complete fast and on the last of which the sinner subsists on saktus alone and in the intervening four days he subsists on the thick gruel of barley cooked in cow's urine,

CHAPTER VI 

CONSEQUENCES OF NOT UNDERGOING PENANCES 

If a sinner did not undergo a prāyaścitta, the Smộtis, Purānas, medieval digests declared that he had to suffer dire and far-reaching consequences. Yāj. III. 221 declares that men addicted to sins, who feel no repentance and who (therefore ) do not undergo the proper penances, fall into painful and horri ble hells. Manu XIT. 54 ff and Yaj. III, 206 ff provide that those guilty of grave (and other) sins after having passed numbers of years in hells and suffered the tortures of horrible hells are born again in this world because of (the remnants of their) evil actions in different forms such as lower animals, insects, trees and shrubs &c. Manu XI. 53 ordains that one should always perform penance in order to free oneself from sins, since those who have not destroyed their sins (by means of prāyaścittas) are born again endowed with disgraceful marks (such as having bad nails, black teeth &c.). Manu XI. 48 also emphasizes that wicked men suffer mal-formations owing to their wicked deeds committed in this very life or in a former life. The Vispu purāṇa 355 echoes the words of Yāj. III. 221. The Visnudharmo ttara declares 356 that those (sinners ) who do not undergo penances nor are punished by the king fall into hell and are born also as lower animals and even after attaining human bodies they become marked (with bodily defects). Viṣnu Dh. S. (44, 1-10) prescribes 357 that evil-doers, having experienced the horrors of hell pass into animal bodies and that those guilty of atipātakas, mahāpātakas, anupātakas, upapātakas, jāti

bhramsa-kara actions, sankarikaraņa, apatrikarana, nialini karana and miscellaneous sins, respectively enter the bodies of all plants, of worms (or insects), of birds, of aquatic animals, of animals roving in waters, of deer, of cattle, of untouchables among men, of miscellaneous and cruel carnivorous animals (like tigers). Viṣnu Dh, S. 45.1 provides 358 that sinners, after having undergone the horrors of hells and after having passed through the bodies of lower animals, are born as human beings with certain marks (indicative of their sins). So the teaching of these and other authorities comes to this that sins when not expiated by penances or by State punishment, lead to hell, that then, owing to some remnants of the evil deeds, to birth as lower animals and then as decrepit or diseased human beings. 

It is now necessary at this stage to enter upon a historical though brief account of the idea of Hell and of its opposite Heaven 359 There are in the Rgveda hardly any clear or express references to Hell. In Rg. II. 29,6 the sage prays to the Visve Devas 'save me from the pit, from falling down into it' (trādhyam kartād-avapado yajatrāḥ). In Rg. IV. 5. 5 it is said 360 that those men who are bereft of Țta and satya, being sinful, create a deep place for themselves. In Rg. VII, 104.3 the poet calls upon Indra and Soma to strike down 361 into bottomless darkness evil-doers; and in VII. 104.11 the poet prays that whatever enemy desires to harm the poet by day or night may be deprived of his body and progeny and may be hurled below the three earths. Indra is implored in Rg. X. 152.4 by the sage to send down into darkness whoever attacks him and his people. In Rg. IX, 73,8 Soma is said to throw down in a pit those who do not observe Soma's ordinances and who are disliked by him. From these passages what emerges is that the sages of the Rgveda had some faint glimmerings of (or belief in) the idea of a dark

deep pit below the earth to which wicked persons were relegated by the gods. But there is no mention in the Rgveda of the tortures of Hell. It is in the Atharvaveda that we find the clearest references to Hell (Naraka). Sorcerers and demons dwell in a house below (the earth), according to A. V. II. 14. 3. Atharva veda V. 30. 11 asks a man to come out from death, from the deep and black darkness. In Atharvaveda 262 V. 19. 3 it is asserted that those who spat in the face of a brāhmaṇa or who imposed a levy of money on him remain biting hair in the midst of a river of blood. Atharvaveda XII. 4, 36 mentions "Nāraka-loka'. In the Vaj. S. XXX. 5 the Virahan 363 (i. e. one who gives up or extinguishes the consecrated Vedic fires) is relegated to nāraka (nārakāya virahanam). A virahan may also mean 'one who kills a valiant man' but that does not seem to be a proper sense in this passage of the Vaj. S. In the Sat. Br. XI. 6. 1. 4 we find a reference to torments of Hell, viz. men cutting up the limbs of others one by one for crimes committed. The Tai. Ā. I. 19 speaks of four narakas called Visarpin, Avisarpin, Visādin and Avisādin in the south-east, south-west, north west and north-east. From the Kathopanisad it appears that at that time there was a belief that those foolish men who do not know the Reality and who only believe in the existence of the mundane world alone have to be born again and again and fall into the hands of Yama 364 (II. 5-6). The same Upanisad (V. 7) states that after the death (of the body) some enter the womb in accordance with their actions and knowledge to have an embodied existence, while others go into fixed matter (the form of trees and the like). But that Upaniṣad says nothing about the torments of Hell. They were therefore probably not believed to exist in those days, at least, to the same degree as in the days of the Epics and Purānas. The very words at the beginning of the Katha Up. (I. 21 devair-atrāpi vicikitsitam') indicate that there were even then various views about the fate of the departed. The Kausitaki Br. (XI. 3) propounds the remarkable proposition that

just as men in this world eat the (flesh of) beasts, so in the next world the beasts eat men.365 

As regards the opposite idea of svarga (Heaven) the matter is much clearer. In certain Rk verses there are said to be three heavens (e. g. Rg. I.35. 6, VIII. 5.8, VIII. 41.9, IX. 113.9). The generous donor or worshipper is said to occupy heaven and to mix among gods; and gods like Mitra and Varuņa are implored to give the worshipper immortality 366 (Rg. I. 125, 5, V. 63.2, X. 107. 2.). Life in heaven is full of joys and de lights and the denizen of heaven has all his desires fulfilled (Rg. IX. 113. 10-11). 367 In Rg. IX. 113.8 the poet prays 'make me immortal (in heaven) where dwells king Vaivasvata, where the sun is confined (i. e. where it never sets) and where the divine waters flow'. A person who neither offers sacrifices to gods, nor worships, and observes ordinances other than those of Indra is thrown down from Heaven 368. A sage exultingly addresses Soma 'we have drunk soma, we have become immor tal, we have reached Light (Heaven) and we have known the gods; what will an enemy or harmful person do to us who have been mortals so far?' 369 The pious dead become united in Heaven with their Istāpūrta (merit due to sacrifices and chari table acts) and with their fore-fathers and become endowed with a refulgent body (Rg. X. 14.8). Those who practise tapas or those who perform sacrifices in which the fees run to thousands (of cows) reach Heaven (Rg. X. 154. 1-3)370, and Soma, ghee and honey flow for them there. Heaven is said to be the abode of Yama and there resounds the sound of flutes and of songs. 371 The Atharvaveda, being more popular in

character, contains much more information about Heaven. In Atharvaveda IIT. 29.3 it is said that a donor goes to Heaven where a weak man has not to render to the strong any contri bution 372 In Atharvaveda IV. 34.2, 5-6 it is stated that in the heavenly world there are bevies of women (for the denizens ), that there the dwellers get many edible plants and flowers and that there are ponds of ghee, streams of milk and honay, wine flows like water and lotus lakes surround the denizens. In Heaven the meritorious enjoy delight, their bodies being free from disease 373. Atharvaveda VI. 120.3 and other verses ex press a yearning to meet one's parents, wife and sons (vide Atharva XII. 3.17). 374 The Tai. S. is full of references to Heaven and so no quotation is cited here except one where it is said that he who offers the Adabhya cup in Jyotistoma goes to heaven while still living in this world.375 The Tai. Br. appears to hold that those who offer sacrifices become shining stars in the firmament (1. 5. 2. 5-6) 375a. The Sat. Br. (XI. 1. 8. 6) states 'that sacrificer who offers a sacrifice as this redemption is born in the next world (Heaven) with his body entire '. 376 Survival of the soul after death is emphatically asserted in the Tai. Br. III. 10. 11. These passages are enough to establish that the state of the pious after death and of heroes killed in battle was one of happiness in heaven, that there the food and material things (such as honey, ghee) that a person required in this world were also available in greater perfection and abun dance. The remark of Macdonell 'Heaven is a glorified world of material joys as pictured by the imagination not of warriors but of priests' (Vedic Mythology p. 168) is not (in view of Rg. X. 154.3) quite accurate or justified. There is nothing to show

In later times (as in the Bhagavadgitā II, 37 'hato vā prāpsy asi svargam' or in the Raghuvamśa VII, 51) warriors killed in battle were supposed to go to heaven and were privi leged to have the company of beautiful damsels. Heaven as a place or state of eternal bliss to which the spirits of the reli gious or meritorious people or warriors go, is an idea common to most ancient peoples and was probably based on the idea that the Earth was flat and the sky was a dome carrying various celestial objects. In the Brhadāranyaka Up. (IV. 3, 33) and Tai. Up. (II. 8) it is 377 stated that the joys of the world of gods are hundreds of times more delightful than those of the mortal world 378. In the Kathopanisad (I. 12 ) it is stated by Yama him self that in Heaven there is no fear and no old age, that the denizen of Heaven is beyond hunger, thirst and sorrow and is in the midst of all delights. The Kausitaki Br. Up, as quoted by Sankarācārya on Vedāntasūtra I. 1.28 contains the statement that the abode of sinners is below this world or 379 the earth. The Chāndogya Up. in one place remarks380 'those whose con duct has been good will quickly attain some good birth, the birth of a brāhmana or a ksatriya or vaisya. But those whose conduct has been evil will quickly attain an evil birth, the birth of a dog or a hog or a cāņdāla'. 

We have here a complicated blending of two theories. The original theory of early Vedic times was that of Heaven and Hell which is also that of most religions. Later on when the doctri nes of karma and punarjanma came to be universally believed in India the theory of Heaven and Hell came to be modified by holding that the pleasures of heaven and the torments of Hell both came to an end some time or other and the author of sins was born again as an animal or a tree or a human being suffer ing from diseases and defects.

Yama in the Veda 

159 

The fate of the departed soul after the death of the body will be touched upon in the section on Antyesti and Srāddha, but in connection with the doctrine of Hell it is necessary to say something about Yama. In Rg. X. 58, 1 Yama is called Vaivasvata (son of Vivasvat, the Sun). Yama is at least an Indo-Iranian deity. Yama is eulogised in Rg. X. 14. He is called a king and is credited with the task of gathering together people (X. 14. 1); he is said to have been the first to make a way (to Heaven) which was followed by former ancestors of mankind (X. 14.2 Yamo no gátum prathamo viveda...yatrā naḥ pūrve pitarah pareyuh). The soul when departing from this world is told that when he follows the paths of the ancient ancestors he would see the two kings Yama and Varuna. In Rg. X. 14. 13-15 the priests are asked to press Soma for Yama, to offer oblations to him and it is said that yajña reaches Yama, Agni being the messenger. In Rg. X. 135. 1 Yama is stated to drink in the company of gods, he is the lord of men. Yama owns two dogs each having four eyes who guard the way, who are the spies of Yama and who move among men and mark their doings. In Rg. X. 97. 16 the sage prays 'May the plants release me from the (effects of the) violation of oaths, from the violation of the ordinances of Varuna, from the fetters which Yama claps on the feet of sinners and from all sins against the gods."381 In Rg. X. 165. 4 Yama is identified with Mrtyu (death) and the owl (an evil omen) or a kapota is said to be the data (harbinger) of Yama, Rg. I. 38.5 (addressed to the Maruts) appears to crave for something which is opposed to what other references to Yama state 'May not the singer of your praises go by the path of Yama' 382 Thus, though in the Rgveda, Yama is a god and mostly a beneficent ruler of men, there is an element of fear associated with him as the two prying dogs that guard the way to heaven and his being called Mrtyu would suggest. The Atharvaveda refers to Yama in several places in the same strain as in the Rg. In A, V. 18. 3. 13 it is said 383 ‘serve the king Yama with offering, who was the first to die among men, who was the first to depart from this world and who, the son of Vivasvat, is the gatherer of men'. In Tai. S. V. I. 8.2 and V 2.3.1 it is stated that Yama is the lord of all mortals and of

the whole extent of the earth. In Tai. S. III. 3. 8. 3-4 it is declared 384 Yama is indeed Agni and this (earth and altar) is Yami. When a sacrificer strews Oṣadhis on the Vedi it is indeed tantamount to taking up a debt from Yama. If he (the sacrificer) were to go from this world without burning them they (Yama's men) might take him to the next world with fetters round his neck.' In Rg. X. 14. 10385 the pitrs are said to enjoy delights in the company of Yama. In the Ait. Br. 385a (XII. 3) Mștyu is credited with having fetters (pāšas) and wooden maces (sthānu) for catching erring men. It has already been seen how Yama is said to have within his powers again and again foolish men who believe in the existence of this world alone and deny the existence of the next. Thus, from being a beneficent ruler of the departed souls in the very early Vedic times, Yama came gradually to be looked upon as a dreadful punisher of men.386 The Purānas contain graphic descriptions of Yama's abode and of his assistants, chief among whom is Citragupta. For example, the Varāhapurāṇa 386a chap. 205 con tains a dialogue between Yama and Citragupta, in which the latter recommends the fate that a dead person deserves for his actions. The Agnipurāņa chap. 371. 12 states that a sinner falls into horrible hells that are declared by Citragupta at the order of Yama.

Heaven and Hell in post-Vedic Literature 

161 

We must now turn to the ideas of Heaven and Hell contained in the post-Vedic Literature, sūtras, smrtis, purāņas and digests. The Nir. (1. 11 ) quotes387 a quarter of a Vedic verse which means 'for fear that if we (women) acted crookedly (towards our husbands ) we might fall into Hell.' The word Naraka is derived by it in two ways (ni + araka), viz. as meaning 'going below' (the earth) or (na + ra +ka) 'where there is not the slightest place for joy'. In another place, while deriving the word 'putra' (son) the Nir. (II. 11) declares that the son is called putra because he saves (the father) from the hell called put. The same derivation of the word putra is offered by Manu IX. 138 (=Adiparva 229.14 Visnudharmasūtra 15,44). Gautama (13,7) promises 388 heaven to the witnesses in a cause if they speak the truth, but Hell (naraka) if they tell the opposite (of truth). After defining patana as loss of the capacity to perform the privileged acts of twica-born classes (such as Veda study &c.) and stating that by being guilty of sins a man does not in the next world reap the fruits of his good actions, Gautama states the striking view of other sages that naraka is nothing more than this loss of capacity and of the fruits of good acts, his own view how ever being that naraka is a particular place where a man has to dwell solely in distress and sorrow. It was the emphatic view of Gautama that men of the several varnas and asramas that are devoted to the actions prescribed as peculiar to each, enjoy after departing from this body, the fruits of their actions and then owing to some remainder of their total actions are born in bodies in appropriate circumstances as to the country, caste, family, appearance, length of life, learning, conduct, wealth, happiness and intelligence, while those who act contrariwise

History of Dharmaśāstra pass into all sorts of births and are ruined 389. Ap. Dh. S, holds that a man becomes fit for Naraka if he follows activities solely dictated by sensual pleasures. 390 In another place Ap. Dh, S, affirms that Naraka is indeed one's lot when one trans gresses one's dharma. It also states that rewards without end are denominated svargya. The Vedāntasūtra III. 1.13 makes it 391 clear that after enjoying the fruits of one's actions in the abode of Yama (Samyamana) evil-doers ascend to this mortal world. In Vedāntasūtra III. 1.15 the narakas 392 are said to be seven. Pānini VI. 2.38 teaches the accent of mahāraurava. In the Kāśikā com. on Pāṇini III 2.88 a vedic verse is cited accor ding to which one who kills his mother enters the 7th naraka. The Visnupurāṇa I. 6.41 names seven hells, Tāmisra, Andhatā misra, Mahāraurava, Raurava, Asipatravana, Kālasūtra and Avici and (in II. 6. 2-5) names 26 narakas. Sankha-Likhita as quoted by the Madanapārijāta pp. 694-695 mentions in detail the torments that evil-doers undergo in the hells called Kum bhīpāka, Raurava, Mahāraurava &c. Manu IV. 88-90, Yāj. III. 222-224, Visnu Dh. S. 43. 2-22, Agnipurāṇa 371. 20-22, Nārada (prakirnaka 44) enumerate 21 narakas. The names are almost the same in all these works, the variations being due mostly to the scribes having read certain letters differently. The 21 names are generally significant and may be set out from Manu as follows: Tāmisra (darkness), Andhatāmisra (blinding darkness), Mahāraurava, Raurava (abounding in paths with heated surfaces, according to Pr. V. p. 15), Kālasūtra (like the thread on the wheel with which the potter cuts off a raw earthen pot in two), Mahānaraka, Sanjivana (where one is made to revive and is again killed), Mahāvici (where one is submerged in surging waves), Tapana (as burning hot as fire), Sampratāpana (same as Kumbhīpāka, according to Pr. V. p. 15), Sanghāta (making many stay in a small place like the legendary Black

Manu (XII. 75-76) again mentions the Tāmisra, Asipatravana and Kumbhipāka narakas and Manu III. 249 Kālasutra. Kullūka (on Manu. IV. 88-90), Pr. V. (p. 16), the Dipakalikā (on Yāj. III. 222-224) and other commentaries say that the conditions in the hells may be read in the Mārkandeya-purāṇa and other works. Vide Agnipurāņa 203 and 371 (where Hells are said to be 144), Brahmapurāṇa, chap. 22 (which names 25 narakas and states what sinners fall into which of them), chap. 214 (verses 14-17 of which speak of 22 narakas and verses 51-103 contain harrowing descriptions of the horrible torments of hell), chap. 215. 83. ff.

The Bhāgavat apurāņa V.26.6 states that there are 28 narakas, though according to some there are 21. Vide also Viṣnupurāņa 

393. Yaj. and Visnu read 'avici' 'for mahāvici. Yāj. reads Sampra pātana (throwing down in a pit) for Sampratāpana and adds Kumbhīpaka separately, which latter means 'heating after placing inside a jar. The printed Manusmrti reads "Pratimārtikam', which is a misreading of some mss. Some Mss read 'Lobacaraka' which may mean being made to walk over red hot iron' or 'being fettered with irons' (Pr. V. p. 16). All the names are explained by Pr. V. (pp. 15-16) and by some of the commentators of Manu. According to Jamadagni quoted in Pr. V p. 16 Vaitarani is a river in the nether regions which is full of foul smell and blood, which has hot water, is very rapid and has on the crest of its waves bones and hair. Sankha-Likhita (q. by Madanapārijāta p. 695) describes Malta tani as ' taptodaka' (having hot water).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. W.6.2-5, Skandapurāņa I, chap. 39 and VI, 226-227. In the Mārkandeyapurāņa (chap. 12 ) we have a description of several narakas like the Raurava, Mahāraurava, Asipatravana &c. and chap. 14 (verses 39-94) mentions the punishments meted out to perpetrators of various sins. In the Mahābhārata also narakas and the torments thereof are frequently referred to. For example, śāntiparva 321.32 speaks of Vaitaraņi and A.sipatravana, Anušāsana ( 23.60-82) speaks of the actions that lead to hell (each verse having the refrain te vai niraya-gāminah) Anušāsana 145.10-13. Svargārohanika-parva (2.16-26) describes the several horrible sights and torments of such hells as 

Asipatravana' (named in verse 23 ) and Kūțaśālmali (named in Svargārohanika 3.4). The Vrddha-Hārita-smrti (IX. 167-171) mentions almost the same 21 narakas as the Manusmrti does. The craze for multiplying narakas went so far that the Brahmapurā pa, the Visnudharmottara 395, the Garuda-purana and others declared that there were thousands, lakhs and crores of narakas. 

The Visnu Dh, S. (46. 23-29) provides that those guilty of atipātakas, anupātakas, sankarikarana, who have not under gone prāyaścittas suffer respectively for one Kalpa,395a for one Manyantara, for four Yugas, for a thousand years in the 21 narakas in rotation and the other sinners for many years. Yama quoted by the Madanapārijāta p. 696 says that those guilty of Mahāpātakas stay in Hell with face downwards for a yuga and Yama has numerous other verses stating what sinners undergo which horrors of Hell. 

Buddhists appear to have borrowed the doctrine about hells from Brahmanical writers. Vide Dr, B, C. Law's mono graph on 'Heaven and Hell in Buddhist perspective' (1925), pages 111-113, which refer to eight Mahānirayas and there are other Jesser Hells. The eight Mahānirayas are Sañjiva, Kālasutta, Sanghāta, Roruva, Mahāroruva, Tapa, Mahātapa and Avici. It will be noticed how those names agree closely with Manu's list

of hells. For the gruesome details of Hell and torments therein in ancient Jain works, vide Uttarādhyayana-sūtra (S.B.E. vol. 45 pp. 93-97 ) and Sūtrakrtānga I. 5 (S. B. E. vol. 45 pp. 279-286 ). Similarly, for the ideas of Heaven and Hell in Zoroastrianism, vide Mr. S. N. Kanga's 'Heaven and Hell and their location in Zoroastrianism and in the Vedas' (1933). 

The Buddhists held their penitential meetings (Pātimokkha), for which see S. B. E, vol. XIII, pp. 1-69 and for the 92 pācittiya (Prāyaścittiya) rules, vide pp. 32-55 of the same volume. 

There are very glowing descriptions of Heaven ( svarga ) in the Mahābhārata, the Puranas and other works. We have already seen how Heaven was supposed to be a place of delights in the Rgveda and even in the Upanisads like Katha (I. 12-13 and 18 

sokātigo modate svargaloke'). Rg. X. 107.2 affirms that those who give (large) dakṣiņā stand high in the Heavens ( as stars), those that donate horses go in the company of the Sun and those that donate gold become immortal. An3% echo of this is found in Vanaparva 186.9. The Kauṣ. Up. 1.3 speaks of several worlds (lokas) of the gods such as those of Agni, Vāyu, Varuna, Aditya, Indra, Prajāpati, Brahmā and a similar gradation of higher worlds is described in Br. Up. III 6 (such as Devaloka, Indraloka, Prajāpatiloka, Brahmaloka). The Br. Up. 1.5. 16 speaks of manusyaloka, pitrloka and devaloka and holds that devaloka is the best of all worlds.397 Kaus. Up. 1. 4 implies that in the heavenly world divine nymphs, garlands, collyrium, fragrant powder, garments wait upon the fortunate denizens. Sankara on Vedānta-sūtra (IV. 3.4) says that the word 'loka' means 'a place for enjoying the fruits of one's actions (bhogāyatana) and that Hiranyagarbha is the adhyaksa of Brahmaloka (on Vedānta-sūtra IV. 3.10). In the Vanaparya (54. 17-19 ) it is stated that svarga is the place for those who die in battle. How svarga is like and what the pleasures of heaven are is described in Vanaparva, chap. 186.6-7, viz. that there are extensive lakes full of golden lotus flowers and fish and devoid of mud, that on the banks of those lakes dwell the meritorious honoured by Apsarases who apply fragrant cosmetics to their

bodies, wear ornaments and have brilliant golden complexions. Similar pleasures enjoyed in the Nandana park are promised in Brahmapurāṇa, 225.5-6. Vanaparva (chap. 261 verses 28-29) says that there is one great draw-back in going to heaven,viz, that there one simply enjoys the rewards of one's good actions, no new merit is accumulated there, one simply subsists on the accumu lated principal or store of merit and that when that store is exhausted one has to fall down, the only good point about this being that one is born a man and that too in such a way that he enjoys398 happiness. Anušāsana (23. 84-102 ) sets out numerous actions whereby a man attains heaven (each verse having the refrain 'te narāḥ svarga-gāminah'). Similarly, in Brahmapurana 224. 9-14, 18-25 and 30–37 we have the same refrain. . Vide also Anušāsana chapters 144 (verses 5-15, 19-26, 31-39 ) and 145. śānti (99. 4-5) states that svarga is full of those fallen in battle, there are Gandharva damsels there for the brave (and there is hell for the coward) and that svarga yields all desires that one may entertain. The Sāntiparva (192.8 and 21 ) states that svarga was in the North, that (Sānti 191. 13, 193. 27) there was neither hunger nor thirst nor weariness nor old age nor sin (in Heaven), that good men (śānti 271. 24) are seen as stars (or become stars ). In the Matsyapurāṇa ( 276. 17) it is399 stated that he who performs Brahmāndadāna (one of the 16 mahādānas ) reaches the world of Viṣnu and delights in the company of Apsarases. The Brahmapurāṇa (225. 6-7) assures us that a generous donor goes to heaven where he enjoys the best pleasures in the company of Apsarases and in the heavenly garden called Nandana and when he falls down from heaven he is born as a mortal in a rich and noble family.

One is the calculating or bargaining spirit which the smộtis and purāṇas display viz. make this or that gift and then there is so much delight to be enjoyed in heaven, a sort of profit and loss account; and the second is that the highest

Limitations on pleasures of Heaven 167 pleasures of Heaven have a time limit, i. e. they are to come to an end one day and the meritorious have to be born again in mortal bodies. The doctrine was gradually evolved that there is no final release from the cycle of births and deaths by the performance of meritorious deeds alone. 

It is not necessary to set out at length the gruesome torments of Hell described in great detail in several smrtis and purāņas. By way of a sample, the following description taken from a Dharmaśāstra work (viz. Visnu Dh. S. 43.32-45) will be quite enough. "Sinners guilty of having committed (one or more of the nine kinds of) sins have to endure terrible sufferings when they have left this life and reached the path of Yama. Being dragged hither and thither by the fierce servants of Yama they are led (to hell) by them with frightening gestures. (In Hell) they are devoured by dogs, jackals, crows, herons, cranes and other birds eating raw flesh, by snakes and scorpions that have fire in their mouths (i. e. that emit stinging poison). They are scorched by fire, pierced by thorns, divided into parts by saws and oppressed by thirst. They are afflicted with hunger and by terrible hordes of tigers and they faint away at every step on account of the stinking smell of pus and blood. Desiring to secure the food and drink of others they are beaten by the servants (of Yama) whose faces are similar to those of such horrible animals as crows, berons and cranes. In some places they are boiled in oil, in others they are pounded with pestles or ground down in iron or stone vessels. In some places they (have to ) eat what is vomitted or pus or blood or excrements, and hideous meat smelling like pus. In one place they have stay in terrible darkness, and are devoured by horrible worms having flames in their mouths. In some places they are over whelmed by cold or have to pass through the midst of unclean things and in other places the departed devour each other, thus becoming most horrible. In some places they are beaten on account of their former deeds and are suspended in other places (from trees &c.) or are struck with heaps of arrows or are cut into pieces. In other places they have to tread upon thorns and they are encircled by the hoods of serpents, they arner mented with machines and are dragged by their knees Theit backs, heads and necks are fractured, they become terrible (to look at ), their throats being reduced to the size fit for a cave shelter and they become unable to bear torments. Sinners are being tormented in this way and having suffered rinterige

That naraka is a place below the earth is frequently stated in the Purānas. For example, in the Garuda and Brahmānda purāṇas all Hells such as Raurava are stated to be situated below the earth. Vide Vispupurāṇa II. 6.1 also. The Bhāga vatapurāņa states that Hells are below the earth and above water to the south of the three worlds and hang without support, in which dwell the troups of pitrs called Agniśvātta and others. 400 The Agnipurāņa (371. 13-14) avers that the 28 groups of narakas are below the earth and even below the 7th Pātāla. 

We come across Vedic passages such as these This sacri ficer who is possessed of the utensils of Yajna directly reaches Heaven' (Sat. Br. XII, 5. 2. 8. ) 401, one who desires Heaven should offer the Darśapūrņamāsa sacrifice', one desirous of attaining heaven should perform the Jyotistoma sacrifice'. What is meant by svarga or naraka has given rise to hot discus sions from very ancient times. The popular view as reflected even in the Vedas, the smrtis and purāņas was that svarga was a place above the earth and naraka was a place of actual torments below the earth. Even ancient astronomical works located svarga thousands of yojanas above the earth. Parāśara,402 an astronomer and a predecessor of Varāha-mihira quoted by Utpala on Br. Sam. I. 11, stated 'Bhū (the earth) is 67080 crores of yojanas and it is the expanse of the earth; beyond it there is impenetrable darkness, in the midst of which there is the golden

mountain Meru, 84000 yojanas high and sixteen below and thrice as much in length and width, which is called svarga. But it would be far from the truth to say that all eminent writers were agreed on the actual existence of svarga and naraka as places. It has already been shown how several centuries before Christ Gautama refers to the view of some predecessors of his that naraka is not a place, but simply means the loss of the capacity to perform the peculiar actions of one's varņa. There were others who argued in the same strain. Sabara (on Jai. IV. 3.27-28) quotes a Vedic passage where the view of the sage appears to be that sacrifices yield the reward promised by śruti in the next life and where Kumārila 403 in his brief comment propounds the view that the injunctive passage (vidhi) of the Veda only promises a reward but does not state that it follows immediately in this life, that svarga which means unsurpassed joy, can happen only in another life. On Jaimini VI. 1.1. Sabara first puts forward the prima facie view that svarga 404 imports in popular language such things (dravya) as fine silken clothes, sandalwood paste, young damsels only 16 years old and that the word svarga is also popularly applied to a particular place where there is neither heat nor cold, neither hunger nor thirst, neither distress nor fatigue and where only those that have done meritorious deeds can reach and not others. Sabara refutes this view and holds that the primary meaning of the word svarga is joy 405 or delight and not a thing (dravya) 

which brings joy. 

There is a well-known and oft quoted verse which defines svarga as follows: 406 that happiness which is not mixed up with

pain, which is not immediately afterwards overwhelmed (by pain) and which is present whenever desired, is denoted by the word svaḥ (or svarga). The Prakarana-pañcikā of Šalika nātha,406a one of the early works of the Prabhākara Mimānsā school, affirms that in such sentences as 'one desirous of heaven should perform the Jyotistoma' the rite is simply commended by Vedic passages, which are no more than arthavādas, as a means of securing long-enduring happiness which is free from the taint of all kinds of sorrow and which is present at the mere desire of the enjoyer. The Sāntiparva expressly states The wise do not regard the other world as directly seen by anyone; one has to entertain faith (in the existence of the other world) because otherwise one may run counter to the Vedas.' 407 The Brahmapurāṇa and the Visnupurāņa speak in the same strain as Sabara that svarga is what causes happiness to the mind, that naraka is the opposite of it and that meritorious deeds and wicked deeds are designated as svarga and naraka respectively and that svarga and naraka are really states of the mind characterised by happiness and pain respectively.408 

One need not wonder at the crude ideas of naraka and svarga entertained by most ancient Indian writers and works. The same ideas were prevalent among peoples of all religions all the world over. For example, The Egyptians whose dynastic history covers a period of about 5000 years had very remarkable beliefs about Heaven and Hell which were illustrated with pictorical representations copiously (as no other nation had ever done), although the oldest Books of the Dead are without illustrations of any sort (vide E. A. W. Budge's 'Egyptian Heaven and Hell', 1905 p. XI and 2). Sheol was the name the Hebrews gave to the gloony abode of the dead in the lowest parts of the earth and it was a land of darkness, which was appointed as the house for all living (Job 10. 21-22 and 30. 23). The Greek Hades closely resembles the Hebrew Sheol in its chief characteristics. In the New Testament also Hell is a land of everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels and it is a place where the wicked go into everlasting torment

and punishment, while the righteous attain life eternal (Matthew 25. 41 and 46, Luke 16.23). The words of the New Testament are plain enough that Heaven was supposed to be a place above the earth and the clouds and that Hell was a place below the earth full of darkness and torments. Vide Luke 23. 43, Ephesians I. 3 and 20, II. Cor. 12. 4, Rev. 2.7; and Luke 12.5 and 16.23; II. Peter 2.4 and Rev. 6.8, 20. 13-14. Bloomfield in his 'Religion of the Veda' p. 252 remarks 'In later Hindu times Hell is filled out with the usual gruesome stage-setting in the style of Dante's Inferno or the wall paint ing in the campo santo at Pisa'. Even men of genius like Shakespeare and most Christian theologians 409 down even to modern times believed in a literal interpretation of passages from the Bible which speak of Heaven and Hell as places. It is only recently that many Christians have begun to hold that the language of the Bible about Heaven and Hell is purely symbolical in character 410. 

409. Vide William James in 'Varieties of religious experience' p. 264, where he says that the fear of the old-fashioned Hell fire was employed by Christianity to extract from it fruits for repentance and conversion value and Pringle-Pattison in 'Idea of Immortality' pp. 15-19. Vide for the Quranic ideas of Hell, SBE, vol IX p. 317 'Hell is a reward for the out rageous to tarry therein for ages. They shall not taste therein cool nor drink but only boiling water and pus'. Vide also SBE. vol. VI p. 247 (Hell contains seven divisions), vol. VI p. 165 (for the misbeliever is the torment of hell fire), vol. XIV p. 317 and p. 340 (for boiling water, pus and fire). In the Quran Heaven was supposed to consist of seven divisions viz Garden of Eternity, Abode of peace, Abode of rest, Garden of Eden, Garden of Resort, Garden of pleasure, the Garden of the most High, the Garden of Paradise. 

410. The Report on the 'Doctrine of the Church of England' published in 1938 by a Commission consisting of some of the highest dignitaries of the English Church makes interesting reading, though to a non-christian the language appears rather full of circumlocution and far from clear and definite. On p. 206 the Report states "The drama of the Last Things as set forth in the medieval 'Doom' pictures rests on a tradition which makes use of a more or less literal conception of heaven and hell as specific "places', of which a picture was formed by drawing upon traditional material, more especially the imagery of the Book of Revelation, which is itself largely drawn from Jewish and other pre-christian sources. .. . A quasi-literal interpretation of the imagery has in fact generally prevailed among Christians and has been wide-spread even in educated circles almost down to the present day.' On p. 219 the above Report remarks As the essence of Hell is exclusion from the fellowship of God, so the essence of Heaven is that followship. It is not a selfish happiness offered in reward for

The Smrtis had evolved the doctrine, as stated above, that if a sinner did not undergo prāyaścitta, he had to suffer tor ments in hell, thereafter he became born as some insect or lower animal or a tree on account of some remnants of his sins and that he was born as a human being afflicted with certain diseases or with defects. 411 These last two consequences are described under the title karmavi pāka (the fruition of evil deeds).

Heaven is also a fellowship of finite spirits." It will be patent how modern European minds have begun to think of Heaven and Hell in terms analogous to those in which some of the best minds of India thought of them centuries before and after the Christian era. In spite of the glowing pictures of the pleasures of Heaven and terrifying descriptions of the torments of Hell detailed in many of the sacred and popular works in Sanskrit and other Indian languages people have gone on committing all sorts of sins. The ancient machinery of Heavens and Hells must be deemed to have largely failed of its purpose in these days. Large masses of men appear to be slipping into an abyss of despair, misery, hardness of heart, wanton brutality and lawlessness. The lurid accounts of bombings and night raids on big cities, the reports of the bloody battles for six years in the World War No. 2, the harrowing tales of tortures in such prisoners' camps as at Belsen, the phenomenal rise in the prices of all necessities of life (food, clothing and shelter), frequent strikes and struggles between the employed and the industrialists, growing indiscipline, arson, plunder and bestial treatment of human beings on the ground of race or religion have produced hardness of heart and debased large masses of Indian people. It is a very difficult question for our leaders how to revive among the common people of India, (whom Westerners dubbed mild Hindus) the old characteristics of tolerance, peacefulness, goodwill and respect for human life and property, how to build up a new fabric of society, a new civilization and culture on the ancient Upanisadic foundations of the pursuit of Reality, brotherhood of man, the unity of all life, and love of mankind even without pressing into service the ancient and medieval literal conceptions of Heaven and Hell,

The doctrine of Karmavipāka 

173 

sins that have not undergone prāyaścitta are, after undergoing the torments of Hell, born with bodies marked with certain condemned signs. One guilty of grave sins bears such signs for seven births, one guilty of upapātaka for five births and one guilty of pāpa for three births. These marks indicative of their having committed a particular sin are observed in each life and only disappear after they repent and perform prāya ścitta. Similarly, the diseases arising from sinful deeds sub side by adopting the remedies of the recitation of Vedic texts, worship of gods, homas and gifts.' Verses 6-10 specify the diseases that arise in consequence of sins such as leprosy, tuberculosis, gonorrhoea, dysentery, kidney trouble, stone in the bladder, cough, fistula &c. A man may commit sins of three kinds viz. by the body, in words and mentally (Manu XII. 3). Really speaking, it is the mind that is the spring of all actions (Manu XII. 4), but for the sake of convenience, this threefold division is made. Coveting another's wealth by unfair means, desiring that evil should befall another and persistence in false ideas (such as the one that there is no soul, but that the body is the soul)-these three are mental sins (Manu XII, 5). Harshness of speech, falsehood, backbiting and irrelevant prattling-these four are vocal sins (ibid XII. 6). Appropriating to oneself another's wealth without his consent, injury to sentient beings against the injunctions of śāstra, sexual intercourse with another's wife-these three are bodily sins (ibid XII. 7). Manu provides that bodily sins reduce a man to the state of a fixed object (tree & c.), vocal sins reduce him to the state of birds and beasts and mental sins to the lowest castes (Cândāla and the like). Hārita (q. by Par. M.)112 speaks of 18 evil actions that lead to hell, of which six are mental, four vocal and the rest are bodily sins. Manu XII. 54-59 and 62-68, Yaj. III. 131, 135 136, 207–208 and 213-215, Vispu Dh. S. Chap. 44, Atri. Chap. 4.5-14, 17-44 (in prose) state into what animals, trees and creep ers sinners are born after undergoing hell torments. The state ments of Yaj, being concise are set out here. This soul enters into hundreds of bodies in this samsāra, viz, as one of the lowest castes, bird or fixed object (tree &c.) on account of his lapses spring ing from the mind, speech and body (Yāj. III. 131); a man who

III. 207-208). On stealing leafy vegetables one is born as a peacock, on stealing perfumes one is born a chuchundari (musk-rat); the thief of corn, of a vehicle, fruits, water, milk, domestic utensils (like pestle), honey, flesh, a cow, fire, cloth, juice (of sugarcane or the like) and salt is born respectively as a mouse, a camel, a monkey, a plava (duck), a crow, a sparrow, bee, vulture, godhā (iguana), crane, a man suffering from white leprosy, a dog, ciri (cricket bird). The Brahmapurāṇa (chap. 217 verses 37-110) contains a long dis quisition on the different kinds of animal births that sinners of various kinds have to undergo. Vide also Garudapurāṇa (Pretakhanda) 2.60-88, Agni 371.30-32 (which latter states that the murderer of a brāhmaṇa is born as a beast or deer or a dog, hog, or camel, the drinker of wine as an ass or pukkasa or mleccha, the thief of gold as a worm or pest or moth, one guilty of incest as grass or a bush). 

It was believed in very ancient times that diseases were the consequences of sins413. In the Atharvaveda VIII, 7.3 plants are said to have destroyed from each limb the disease due to sin414 Manu XI, 49-52, Vas. 20.44, Yāj. III. 209-211, Visnu Dh. S. Chap. 45, Śatātapa I. 3-11 and II, 1, 30, 32, 47, Gautama smrti in verse chap. 20 and Gautama (in prose q. by the Mit. on Yaj. III, 216) or Věddha-Gautama (according to Smrtimuktāphala 

413. This belief is not confined to India. In the Gospel of St. John (9.1-3 ) when a man blind from birth came before Jesus the disciples asked him who did sin, this man or his parents that he was born blind'. Jesus is said to have rejected that idea and performed a miracle by restoring to him his sight after applying to the man's eyes clay mixed with the spittle of Jesus and washing his eyes in a pool.

p. 861), Yama (q. by Pr. M. p.9), Sankha (q. by the Mitākṣarā on Yāj. III. 216 ), Smrtyarthasāra pp. 99-100 state the diseases and bodily defects from which sinners suffer after they are born as men. As a sample Yāj. III, 209-211 may be cited here; the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from Tuberculosis, a drinker of surā has black teeth, the thief of brāhmaṇa's gold has diseased nails, one guilty of incest suffers from leprosy; the thief of food suffers from dyspepsia, one who stealthily learns without permission (or one guilty of plagiarism ) is born dumb, one who mixes up inferior corn with superior corn is born with excessive limbs (with six fingers &c.), a backbiter is born with pus in the nose; a thief of oil is born as tilapāyi and one who falsely reports faults in others has a foetid breath. Yāj. ITI, 217 states that after reaping the consequences of their ( evil) deeds (by falling into Hell and) by reaching the state of lower animals, sinners are born as human beings of a low order, poor and with con denned marks on the body; even medical works like the Carakasamhitā held the belief that diseases were the con sequences of actions done in past lives (vide Sūtrasthāna, Chap. I. 116 ), 

The smrtis are not in complete agreement about the diseases or bodily defects that sinners of various grades suffer. For example, though Vas. 20.44 and Sankha (q. by Mit. on Yāj. ITI. 216 ) state that the murderer of a brāhmana suffers from leprosy, Manu XI, 49, Yāj. III. 209, Visnu Dh. S. 45. 3, Agni. 371. 32 aver that he suffers from phthisis. For want of space the long lists of the births as lower animals and the diseases and deformities from which sinners suffer contained in Sankha, Hārīta, Gautama, Yama and the Purānas quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 216, the Par. M. II. part 2 pp. 230-240, 242-272, Madanapārijāta pp. 701-702, the Mahārņava-karmavipāka are passed over here. 

Ap. Dh. S. (II. 1. 2. 6-7) states that a brāhmaṇa, ksatriya or vaiśya sinner guilty of brāhmaṇa murder, after undergoing the torments of Hell is born again respectively as a Candāla, Paulkasa and Vaiņa and that other sinners who have become outcasts by their sins are born on account of these as certain animals (like pigs). Similarly, Manu XII, 61 provides than one who from greed steals precious stones, pearls, corals and jewels of various kinds is born as a goldsmith.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

Although the word Karman is ordinarily employed to denote good as well as evil actions still in the section on pen ances the word 'Karman' prominently presents to the mind the idea of evil deeds. Hence Karmavipāka means the ripening (or fruition) of evil actions or sins. This fruition takes three forms, as stated in the Yogasūtrā415 II. 13, viz. jāti (birth as a worm or animal &c.), āyuh (life i. e. living for a short period such. as five or ten years) and bhoga (experiencing the torments of Hell &c.). The word Karmavipāka appears to have been known to Yāj. III, 131 (vipākah karmaņām pretya kesām cid-iha jāyate) and it occurs frequently in the Purāņas (e. g. in Brahma-purana 224. 41, 225. 43 and 59, Matsya 115. 14 &c.). The Pr. Sāra pp. 219-231 contains probably the longest treatment of Karma vipāka. The doctrine of Karmavipāka was well known to the Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna, who in his Ratnāvali refers to it416. The Buddhist Avadānasatakas also refer to the doctrine of Karmavipāka. Vide also Suttanipāta (S. B. E. vol 10 part 2) p. 38 and S. B. E, vol. 21 p. 130 (Saddharma-pundarika ). In some medical works also such as the Hāritasamhitā it is said that the murderer of a brāhmaṇa suffers from white leprosy and the killer of a cow from black leprosy; a regicide suffers from phthisis, and the destroyer of a park from dysentery &c.417. In the Vivāgasuyam (Vipākaśrutam), which is the 11th anga of the Jaina-āgama and an edition of which was brought out by Dr. P. L. Vaidya (in 1933) we have stories of persons who suffered from evil diseases owing to their committing evil deeds in former lives and other stories of the fruits of good deeds. 

The doctrine based upon the implications of Manu XII418. 3,9 and 54 and Yaj. III. 206 was that it is human beings alone (and not lower animals like tigers &c.) that have to experi

ence in Heaven and Hell the consequences of their deeds. The Viṣnudharmottara explicitly states s0419 

The Mit on Yāj. III, 216), the Smrtyarthasāra, Par, M., Pr, Sāra and other works state that the disquisition on Karmavipāka420 is merely an arthavāda, that it is not to be taken literally, but is meant to induce sinners to undergo such prāyaścittas as Prājāpatya which entail great worry and trouble and which no one might willingly undertake. The Mit. points out that the description of the diseases (like pthisis) is not intended for requiring those who suffer from them to undergo the penances for twelve years or the like nor for indue ing people to avoid contact with such persons, that sistas do not avoid contact with those who have bad nails, that in the case of such persons the disease or defect is the last result of what little sin remained attached to them and that by the very fact of their 'having the disease or defect mentioned in the texts they become free from the last remnants of their sins and therefore they do not stand in need of any further panance and as their sin is finally removed by suffering the disease or defect their fitness for being allowed to mix among people is established, 

The teaching of the works on Karmavipāka, though dismal and terrifying, comes to this that no soul need be without hope provided it is prepared to wait and undergo torments for its mis. deeds, that it need not be appalled by the numerous existences foreshadowed in those works and that the soul may in its long passage and evolution be ultimately able to discover its true greatness and realize eternal peace and perfection. . * Manu XII, 69 (almost the same as Vispu Dh, S. 44.45 and Garudapurāṇa II, 2. 89) states that women guilty of the sin of theft become the wives of men who are guilty of the same 'offences.

Varāhapurāṇa (chap. 203. 21 ff.) expatiates at length upon the topic how sinners endure torments in Hell for innumerable years, how after their evil deeds have been almost wiped out they become human beings suffering from various diseases or deformities. 

In the Mahārņava-karmavipāka of Māndhātr it is stated that there are two means of destroying the consequences of (evil) actions, viz. krochra (penances) and the reversal (or remedies) against diseases421. The latter consists in making golden images of the sun (as the superintending deity of good health ) and of the deity of a disease and offering worship to both these in a mandapa on a raised vedikā (plat form). The work expatiates at length on the Vedic verses employed according to Āśvalāyana and the Taittiriya Sakha for ghosa-sānti (propitiatory ceremonies with loud recitation of Vedic mantras); the worship of the sun with Vedic mantras and of the planets, the offerings of āhutis, the Rudraikādasini, Mahārudra (11 times as many as the preceding ) and Ati rudra, repeating the thousand names of Visnu, Vinayaka santi (as laid down by Yāj. I. 271-294), Navagraha-yajña in which it assigns each planet to some country and some gotra *22. It also prescribes how for the removal of particular diseases particular dānas may be given (such as Kadalidāna i. e. manufacturing a kadali plant from one pala of gold and donat ing it). It deals with the gifts of the images of all diseases supposed to be incurable and quotes Śatātapa II, 47-48 in con nection with the removal of rājayakṣmā (phthisis). It deals at length with fevers and other diseases and bodily defects such as greenish or cat-like eyes, deafness &c. But the detai led treatment of all these matters is passed over here from considerations of space, and also for the reason that these prescriptions are now either hardly believed in by people or hardly ever performed.

CHAPTER VII 

ESCHATOLOGY 

What happens after death to a human being (which is the subject matter of Eschatology) has been a great mystery that has intrigued and baffled mankind in all ages and was a question of vital importance among almost all ancient peoples such as the Indians, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Greeks and Persians. The word Eschatology is derived from a Greek term meaning 'last things and is applied to the study of opinions that men have held from time to time concerning the future. including such matters as the state of man after life on this earth and the end of the world. It exercises a great fascination over most people and speculation on it can be carried on endlessly. Every religion has its own eschatology. There are two aspects of Escha tology; one is concerned with the destiny of the individual after death, immortality of the soul, sin and punishment, the meaning and content of 'Heaven' and 'Hell'; the other aspect of eschatology has relation to the whole universe, its creation, destination and renovation, and the ultimate end of all things. The first aspect and matters relevant to it from the ancient Indian point of view will be dealt with in this section and the second aspect of Eschatology is reserved for treatment in a later section. In ancient works far more emphasis was laid on the first than on the second, while modern men with a more or less scientific outlook and attitude are inclined to think more of the second aspect. 

Death has been generally looked upon with feelings of awe and terror, though there were men (often philosophically minded) who looked upon it as a blessing and as a release of the spirit from the shackles imposed upon the latter by the body Do The terror of death was in many cases due not so much to the pain

[Vol. 

caused at the time of death but rather to the mystery that sur rounds what happens after death and to the thoughts about what the survivors would have to undergo. It is said by C. E. Vulliamy in his work 'Immortal man' (p. 2): 'although the idea of that life (ghostly life) ranges from the most dismal and horri ble fantasies to the most sublime imaginations, the fundamental thought is always the same, the body dies but not the spirit'. There were several attitudes adopted by primitive as well as civilized people towards death. In the Kathopaniṣad we read (I. 1.20 ) When a man dies there is a doubt, some saying that there is survival after the death of the body and some denying any survival' and Naciketas requests the dreaded God Yama to solve this doubt. There are several beliefs422a even among those who hold that there is survival after death. Some say that there is a world of the dead to which whatever survives. goes after death. Others believe that the surviving part goes to Heaven or Hell according as the man has been virtuous or sinful in his life on earth. Others believe in transmigration and re-incarnation. Several of the great writers in ancient Greece believed in this last doctrine, as Pindar (in second Olympian Ode), Plato (in Phaedrus and Timaeus) and Herodotus (II. 123) indicate. 

The Brahmapurāņa (chap. 214 verses 34-39) sets out the persons to whom death is happy and easy and not a source of misery and sorrow. A few may be mentioned hera.-'He who did not tell lies, he who did not prove false to affection or friendship, who is an āstika (a believer in God and the life to come), who is devoted to the worship of gods and the honouring of brāhmaṇas, he who does not bear malice to anyone-these have a happy death, Similarly, the Anusāsanaparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 104. 11-12, chap. 144. 49-60) states at length the causes of prema fure death and of long life. Some of them may be translated here. Those who are atheists, do not perform the acts (or sacrifices ) propar for them, violate the (dictates of) elders and of śāstras, who do not know what dharma is and are evil-doers are short-lived. Those who have no character, who always break all rules of conduct, who have promiscuous sexual inter: course become short-lived and go to Hell. One who is not irritable by temper, speaks the truth, doas not cause injury to beings, who bears no malice to any one and who is not crooked--these live for a hundred years' (104. 11-12 and 14). B

Signs of Approaching Death 

181 Several works specify the signs indicative of the approach of death. The Sāntiparva of the Mahābhārata (chap. 318.: 9-17), Davala quoted in the Moksakānda of the Kalpataru.. (pp. 248-250, about 20 verses), the Vāyupurāņa (chap. 19 verges 1-32), the Mārkandeyapurāņa 43. 1-33 (chap. 40 verses: 1-33, Venkatesvara Press ed.), Lingapurāṇa (pārvārdha chap. 91 ) and other Purānas contain long lists of the signs of approa ching death. It is impossible for want of space to set out in detail these signs. But the gist of a few verses is mentioned by way of sample. The Santiparva (chap. 318) states that a man who is not able to see the star of Arundhati which he could for.. merly see, nor the pole-star nor the full moon, nor his own reflec-.. tion in another man's eye has only one year to live; he has only a span of six months of life left to him who sees the orb of the moon with a hole in it; a man has only seven days left, of life who sees a hole pierced in the orb of the Sun, who smells the odour of a corpse when fragrant substances are near; when the nose and ears bend down, when his teeth and eyes become discoloured, when there is loss of consciousness, and loss of bodily heat, when smoke emerges from the crown of the head, when the left eye begins to ooze moisture all of a sudden these are indications of the immediate approach of death, Davala states indications that prognosticate life for only one year, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 months, one month, half a month, 12 days, 4 days, 3 days, 2 days and winds up by saying that one who cannot hear the humming sound in his ear (when closed with fingers) or cannot see the light in the eye is going, to die immediately. The Vāyupurāņa (19.28) and Lingapurāņa 91.30 regard the last two as the worst indications of approaching death 433. The Lingapurāņa (pūrvabhāga chap. 91.24) states that he who cannot see his own reflection in another's eye will not live. There is an interesting paper by Dr. R.G. Harshe in the Munshi Diamond Jubilee volume (pp. 246-268) where the learned writer. gives the text of two mss. on the prognostications derived from dreams e. g. if a man sees an ass in a dream he is sure to die or if he sees an old maid then it is an indication of danger; disease and death (p. 251) or if he sees a trident death is indicated (p. 254).

History of Dharmaśāstra 

(Vol. When a man is sinking and is almost on the point of death it was and even now is the practice in many parts of India to take the dying man down from the bedstead and place him on a bed spread on the earth424 For example, the Kausika-sūtra (80.3) prescribes 428 : When the man is losing all strength, he (the son or other attending relative) spreads kušas on the grass growing in the shed and takes him down (from the bed-stead) with the mantra 'syonāsmai bhava' (mayst thou be good to this man, Oh Earth). The Baud. P. S. III. 1.18 says that sand should be spread on the ground in the sacrificial shed when it is feared that the sacrificer is dying and darbha grass should be strewn on the sand with the sharp ends turned to the south and the dying man should be placed thereon and one (son or the like) should repeat in his right ear the anuvāka beginning with 'yusah prānam santanu'. The Gobhilasmrti III. 22 and later works like the Pitrdayita provide the same procedure. 

Medieval digests like the Suddhiprakāśa (pp. 151-152) state that when a parson is moribund, has half closed his eyes and is taken down on the ground (from a bed-stead), his son or other relative should make him give one or more of ten gifts viz, of cows, 426 land, sesame, gold, clarified butter, clothes, grain, jaggery, silver, salt. These gifts are superior even to a śrāddha performed at Gayā or to even hundreds of Aśvamedhas. The

Gifts when death approaches 

183 

sankalpa (verbal declaration of the gift) is made in the words 'I shall make ten gifts for the attainment of heaven (abhyudaya), or for the removal of all sins'. After the ten dānas, a cow with a calf should be donated if possible 427 (this cow being called utkrānti-dhenu'a cow donated in view of death') and then another cow called Vaitaraps with gold (or two pieces of cloth &c) should be donated. The Antyestipaddhati and the Suddhi prakāśa (pp. 152-153) set out all the mantras (not vedic) that are to be recited at the tinie of making the several gifts, which (mantras) are passed over here for want of space. The Antyegti paddhati, the Antyakarmadipaka and other works prescribe that when a person is near death, his son or other relative should make him perform Vratodyāpana, sarvaprayascitta and the gift of ten dānas or if the dying man is unable to do these himself, the son or the other relative should perform these and give the merit thereof to the dying man. A person often resolves upon observing certain vratas, but fails to carry out all the details of those yratas to the end. The Vratodyāpana for the dying man is meant to cure all such unfinished vratas. The A.K.D. (pp. 3-4) has a long note about the performance of vratodyāpana. Briefly it comes to this. The son or other relative having brought about the purity of the dying man's body by a bath or by sprinkling it with holy water (mārjana) or by making him drink Ganges water, having himself taken a bath and perform ed his daily duties (of sandhya), having lighted a lamp, having bowed to Ganesa and prayed to god Vispu, having placed before him the materials of worship and having repeated the usual sankalpa ( see note 428 ), he should honour a brāhmana

already invited and should give to him the gold (or silver ) set apart for the purpose and the brāhmaṇa should pronounce the words."May all vratas be fulfilled! May there be the attain iment of the fruits of udyapana (accomplishment of vrata)": In the sarvaprāyascitta the son approaches 4 or 3 learned men or one man knowing adhyātma (metaphysics ) and offers the substitutes (of gold &c.) for sins that involve penances for 6, 3 or 13 years or makes a declaration and performs the prāyas. citta, after the days of impurity. 

The sarvaprāyaścitta was to be performed by the dying man or by his son or other relative who was to shave himself, take a bath, drink pañcagavya, honour a brāhmaṇa with sandal paste and other things; after having honoured the cow or the money to be paid in lieu of it, and after referring to the several kinds of sins that one may be guilty of (vide note 429) he is to make a gift of a cow (with a calf) to the brāhmana or in lieu of it, of some money. After sarvaprāyaścitta come the ton dānas stated above. In the dānas the Kāmastuti 430 as studied by the followers of each veda was to be recited. The Garudapurana (II. 4. 7-9 ) further prescribes other dānas called mahā-danas viz., of sesame, iron, gold, cotton, salt, seven kinds of corn, land and cows, when a man is dying and also other gifts called padadānas such as of umbrella, sandals, ring, water-jar, seat, food. The Garudapurana (II. 4.37) further provides that if a man about to die takes sannyāsa according to the rules laid

Thoughts of a dying man 

185 

down for what is called āturasannyāsa he never returns to the cycle of births and deaths. IO 

From ancient times it was a firmly held belief that the thoughts that a dying man entertains at the time of death determine what will happen to his spirit after physical death (this is expressed in the well-known words 'ante matiḥ sā gatih'), that therefore a man should, when death approaches, give up all thoughts of mundane affairs and all earthly attachments, should think of his favourite deity (Hari or Siva), should inaudibly recite such mantras as 'om namo Vāgudevāya'. Several texts insist on making the dying man listen to holy Vedic texts. The Gautamapitr-rnedhasūtra (I.1-8) prescribes that one should at the time when one's father, mother, brother, teacher or a brāhmana friend is on his death-bed make the dying man hear the first and last verses of the Veda and certain sūmans and should mutter in the dying man's right ear (one sāman). The Rgvidhāna provides that one should repeat at the time of death the sūkta beginning with 'trātāram.' 431 (?) 

The Hir. P. S. I. 1 provides that when it is thought that the āhitāgni is going to die, he (the son or the like) should mutter in the dying man's ear (if he is a knower of Brahma) the two anuvākas of the Tai. Up. II. 1 (beginning with 'brahmavidāpnoti param') and III. 1 (beginning with 'Bhrgurvai vārunih'). The A. K. D. (p 18) says 432 that if the dying man is unable to engage in japa he should revolve in his mind the benign form of Visnu or Siva and should listen to the thousand names (of Viṣnu or Siva), the Bhagavadgitā, the Bhāgavata, Bhārata, Rāmāyana, the Upaniṣads like Išāvāsya and hymns to Soma.

The germs of this idea are found even in the Upaniṣads. The Chandogya Up. (in the famous Sāņdilya-vidyā, III. 14. 1) remarks ‘All this is Brahman. A man should meditate on that (all this) as beginning, ending and subsisting in it (Brahman). Now man is a creature of his will. According to whatever is his will (or thought) in this world, so will he become after departing from this world.' 433 The Praśna Up. III. 10 contains a similar idea. It is here asserted that it is thought power or the will that raises the soul higher and higher, and that the human mind should try to realize the idea that behind all physical transformations the Universe is one and is informed by one all-pervading Essence. Similarly, the Bhagavadgitā puts this idea in a much more clear way. The man, who remembering me alone in his last moments, departs from this life, comes to me; there is no doubt about this' (8.5). But in order to guard against the possible inference that it is only the thoughts at the approach of death that matter whatever the past life led by a dying man may have been, the next verse emphasizes that a man's spirit is engrossed by the thoughts that he has entertained throughout life and that a man can think of spiritual matters or about God at the time of death only if he has been thinking about such matters or about God throughout his life. That verse (8.6) is 'whichever form (or thing) a man remembers when he leaves the body at death, to that alone he goes, having been always (throughout his life) engrossed in meditating over it." 

Some of the digests, on the authority of several Purāņas, prescribe that the dying man should be taken, if possible, near a holy place (tirtha) such as the Ganges. For example, the Suddhitattva434 (p. 299) quotes a passage from the Kūrmapurāṇa to this effect : 'a man attains moksa (final release from samsāra) by dying in the waters of the Ganges, on land or in water at

Vārāṇasi (Benares) and at the confluence of the Ganges with the sea either on land, in water or in the air.' Another passage to the same effect is quoted from the Skanda-purāṇa and it is further said in the same Purāna that for one gavyúti from the banks of the Ganges is a kṣetra (holy place): 'gifts, japa (mut tering of sacred texts), homa performed within this extent is equal to doing the same on the Ganges itself; those who die within this lsetra go to heaven and are not born again. In tl Pujāratnākara 435 it is said: 'Hari is present wherever there is the Sālagrāma stone; one dying near a Sālagrāma stone reaches the highest abode of Visnu'. It was said that a person (even a non-Aryan) dying within one krośa of a Salagrāma reaches Vaikuntha (world of Visnu). Similarly, one dying in a garden of tulasi (Basil) plants or with Tulasi leaf placed in his mouth at the time of death attains mokṣa even if guilty of crores of sins. These are popular notions held even up to this day among common people, not thoroughly affected by modern ideas. 

There are also dicta about the time when it is best to die. The Santiparva of the Mahābhārata states : 'he who dies after the sun has gone to the northern direction (i. e. when the apparent motion of the sun towards the north begins ) and on any auspicious nakṣatra and muhurta is really one who has a store of merit (with him ) ' 436. This is based on the ideas of death in Uttarāyana and Dakṣiņāyana found in the Upanisads. For example, the Chāndogya Up. (IV. 15. 5-6 ) states "Now (if one who knows this dies ) whe ther people perform obsequies for him or not he goes to light (arcis), from light to day, from day to the bright half of the moon, from thence to the six months during which the sun goes to the north, from the months to the year, from the year to the sun, from the sun to the moon, from the moon to

lightning. There is a person who is not human that leads them to Brahman. This is the path of the Devas, the path that leads to Brahman. Those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man, yes, they do not return'. There is a similar passage in Chāndogya Up. V. 10.1-2 where it is said that even householders who know the doctrine of the five fires ( Pañcāgni-vidya) and those who in the forest follow the path of faith and austerities (i. e. vānaprasthas and parivrājakas who do not yet know Highest Brahman) go by the path called Devayāna, while (V. 10. 3-7) those, who, living in a village, practise sacrifices, works of public utility and alms, go to smoke, from smoke to night, from night to the dark half of the moon, from thence to the six months when the sun goes to the south, from thence to the worlds of the fathers, from thence to ether (ākāśa) and to the moon, where they consume their works and return again the way they came. The Chăn. Up. (V. 10. 8) refers to a third place where small creatures (like flies, worms &c.) are continually going and returning. The Br. Up. (VI. 2. 15-16 ) contains similar passages about Devaloka, Pitrloka and the third world of worms, birds and creeping beings. The Bhagavadgitā, basing itself on these Upaniṣad passages, puts the matter succinctly (in 8. 23-25) as follows: I shall state the times at which devotees departing from this world go, never to return or to return. The fire, the flame, the day, the bright fortnight, the six months of the northern (apparent) motion of the sun; departing from the world in these those who know the Brahman go to Brahman. Smoke, night, the dark fortnight, the six months of the southern (apparent) motion of the sun; dying in these the devotee goes to the lunar light and returns. These two paths, bright and dark, are deemed to be eternal in this world. By the one a man goes never to return, by the other he comes back'. The Vedānta sūtra (IV. 3. 4-6) explains that the words 'light' day and others are not to be taken in their literal sense (i, e. as signposts or stages on the paths) but they are to be understood as referr. ing to superintending deities that help the spirits and lead them on the path to the worlds of the Devas or of Pitrs (i. e. they are ātivāhikas and abhimāni devatās). Sankara on Vedāntasütra IV. 2. 20 (ataścāyanepi dakṣine) explains that the waiting for the day of Uttarāyana on the part of Bhiṣma (narrated in the Mahābhārata) is only meant as a eulogy of the path called 

arcirādi', that one who has realized Brahma, even if he dies in dakṣiņāyana, does secure the fruits of his knowledge (viz.

reaching Brahma), that Bhisma waited for the beginning of uttarāyana to abide by popular ideas and practices and to show that he possessed the power to depart from the world at his will owing to the boon conferred on him by his father. The Yajñavalkya-smrti refers to the path (devayāna) 437 that leads to Devaloka (in III, 193-194, where it reads 'mānasah' for 'amānavah' of the Ch. Up.) and the Pitryāna (in III. 195–196 ). In spite of the interpretations of the Vedāntasutra (and of Sankara) the popular belief that death in Uttarayana is best persisted and still persists. For example, the Baud. P.S.(II.7. 21 ) remarks (the sages) provide that death during the northern path of the sun, in the bright half of a month, during the day and at the end of a Srauta sacrifice is best438.' The G. P. S. (IT. 7.1-2) remarks: 'It is desirable to avoid dying in the dark half of a month or at night and the following sūtras provide for the offering of certain oblations if the death occurs in the dark half or at night. 

FUNERAL RITES (antyesti) are a samskāra. Antyesti is one of the 16 (or more) saṁskāras of a twice-born person 

437. The words 'devayāna' and 'pitryana' are a legacy from the hoary past. Even in the Rg, there are frequent references to them. In Rg. III. 58.5 the Asvins are addressed a prayer may you come here to this sacrifice) by the paths leading to the abode of the gods' (eha yātam pathibhirdeva yanaih). Rg. VII. 38.8 also has a similar idea 'may you, being gratified, go by the devayāna paths' (trptā yātam pathibbir-devayānaih). In Rg. VII. 76.2 (addressed to Usas) the sage Vasistha exclaims that he has seen the Devayāna paths when the dawn shone in the East (pra me pantha devayana adrsran). Agni is asked to make the devayāna paths easily accessible and to carry the offerings in a pleased mood (Rg. X.51.5, sugan pathah krnuhi devayānān vaha havyāni sumanasyamanah). Rg. X.98.11 describes Ayni as knowing the devayāna paths according to the seasons and a prayer is offered to him to place Aulāna (son of Santanu) in heaven among the gods (vidvān patha rtuso devayanān-apyaulānam divi deveșu dhehi). In Rg. X.18.1 it is stated that the path of Death is different from devayana (param mrtyo anu parebi pantham yaste sva itaro devayanat). In Rg. X. 2.7 Agni is said to know the pitryāna path (panthamanu pra vidvān pitryanam). In the Tai. Br. II.6.3.5 it is said 'I have heard of two paths of the Fathers ; I have heard about the paths of the gods and mortals' (dve sruti asrnavam pitrnam aham devānām-uta martyanām). The Sat. Br. 1.9.3.2 remarks this is the path called Devayana or Pitryāna.' In the Br. Up. 1.5.16 it is said "there are indeed three worlds, viz. the world of men, the world of bitrs and the world of gods'.

performed with Vedic mantras according to Manu II. 16, Yāj. I. 10, Jātākarnya439. These samskāras were formerly performed for women also (Ašv. gộ. I. 15.12, I. 16.6, I. 17-11, Manu II. 66) but without Vedic mantras (except in marriage) and for sūdras also (Manu X, 127, Yāj. I. 10) but without Vedic mantras. The Baud. P. S. III, 1.4 states that there are two saṁskāras of every human being and they are like a debt i. e, they must be per formed, just as a debt must be discharged viz. the saṁskāra on birth and the one on death (mrtasamskāra). Funeral rites and rites after death varied according as the deceased was an āhitāgni (one who had consecrated the srauta fires) or one who had only kindled the smārta fire, or one who had neither the srauta fires nor the smārta fire, or a woman, a child, an ascetic (parivrājaka), or one dying in a distant land or one dying by accident or committing suicide &c. The srauta and gļhya sūtras differ anyong theinselves in many details even on the same topic and the procedure becomes more elaborate in medieval and later times. It would be impossible to state all the differences on each topic in this section. A separate volume would have to be written for the purpose of setting out all the variations and additions from ancient times to modern times, to discuss why and how they arose or were made, to compare the various sütras and to compare these again with the purāṇas and medieval digests, and to appraise their worth or usefulness. All that can be attempted here is to give the bare outlines of the procedure in different sūtras, smrtis and digests by way of sample in a chronological order. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 569) expressly says that the last rites differ in each Sākhā, though certain things are common to all. 439a Chronological conclusions have been drawn about the relative ages of the sütras (as Dr, Caland does ), of the smrtis, purāṇas and nibandhas from the presence or absence of this or that detail or the elaboration of this or that ritual. But with all respect to the industrious scholars of the West such conclu sions are often tentative or misleading and are purely subjec tive in many cases and are often due to ignorance or loss of ancient works.

Before setting out the rites of crenation contained in the Srauta sūtras, Grhya sutras and later works, it would be best to give here a translation of the five hymns from the Rg. (X. 14-18 ) 440. The verses in these hymns are employed by most of the sütras and are used even now in the cremation rites and most of them occur in the other Vedic Samhitas. Varying interpretations have been given of some of these stanzas by Indian and Western commentators and critics. Only a few of these have been mentioned in the notes. Besides some stanzas are employed for different details of the cremation rites by the different sūtras. All such differences cannot be set out for want of space. The five hymns are so placed that they follow the order of the stages in which the funeral ritual proceeded in fact and is performed even now to a great extent. Vide Appendix for the text of the Rgveda hymns without accents.441

It describes at great length funeral customs in various parts of England, France and other countries in Europe and among Jews and also in other parts of the world. Many of the customs and beliefs that he records bear a close resemblance to customs and beliefs in ancient and modern India, such, as, for example, the alighting of a raven or other black feathered bird on a cottage where a man is very ill as a death warning (p 17), washing and anointing of dead bodies before burial (pp. 34, 36), the hiring of professional women for wailing and shriek 

•ing for the dead (p. 67), condemning burial at night (p. 77), the cutting of 

the hair as a sign of mourning (p. 91), placing meat and drink on the grave for the spirit of the departed (pp. 99-100), refusal of burial in the church yard by the Church for unbaptised children, suicides, lunatics, and those excommunicated (p. 143).

In other places they are associated with Visnu, Aja-Ekapāt and Soma also. The exclamation svāhā is uttered when making an offering to Gods and svad hā when making an offering to pitrs. 

445. 'Nisadya' is really a gerund and not a finite verb. We have to supply some verb like 'madyatām' understood from the preceding half. Vairūpas are a subdivision of the Angiras group.

453. This is rather a very obscure stanza, The A. V. reads "pavate' for 'patati'. 'Trikadruka' occurs frequently in connection with Soma (as ia Rg. II.22.1; VIII.92,21). Sāyana explains that for the performance of Trikadruka sacrifices Yama gives protection and that he comes to the six wide ones for supervising over what was done or not done. The six are mentioned in Sat. Br. 1.5.1.22 as fire, earth, water, wind, day and night. The six wide ones are referred to in Rg. VI.473. The conception is rather vague. The meaning probably is that in the Trikadruka sacrifices the Br̥hatsāma is sung and it reverberates throughout the universe (symbolized as the six wide ones) and that all the verses recited in the several metres do the same.

7. (O deceased) put on (yourself) with cows an armour (i. e. against fire flames) of Agni (i. e, with the skin of the cow) and surround yourself with the thick fat (of the cow), so that (Agni) that overwhelms with his lustre, that takes delight (in: destroying things), that is bold and seeks to burn completely may not scatter (all your parts). 8. O Agnil do not destroy this cup that is dear to the gods and the Soma-loving (pitrs ). In this cup from which the gods drink, the immortal gods take delight464. 9. I send far away the fire that eats raw flesh: may Agni that carries evil (or sins) go (to regions) where Yama reigns! The other Agni (Jātavedas), knowing everything, may take even here the offering to the gods. 10. I, observing the other Agni (Jātavedas) for the purpose of offering a sacrifice to the pitrs, leave aside the fire that devours raw flesh and that entered your house; may he (the other fire) urge on to the highest world the gharma (heated milk or sacrifice465). 11. May that fire which carries the kravyq466 offerings offer them to the pitrs that prosper according to rta! May he offer the oblations to the gods and pitrs! 12. (O Agni!) we who love you have establish ed you and have kindled you. May you loving (the pitrs) bring here the pitrs that love us in order that they may partake of the offering! 13, O Agnil May you extinguish (with water) that spot which you burnt (at the time of cremation! May Kiyambu (plant) arise here and may dūrvă creeper spreading its tendrils grow here! 14. o sítikā (cool plant), O herb full of cooling effect, O Hladikā (freshening herb) causing delight, may you be well associated with a she frog! May you gladden this fire! 

464. X. 16. 8. This mantra is repeated as invocation when the pranita water is carried forward in the cup. As stated below all sacrificial implements are placed on the body of the deceased abitāgni and burnt. But the sage prays that the cup may not be completely destroyed, since it may have to be used in the other world by the departed spirit, 

* 465. X. 16. 10. This verse is rather involved. If the words of this verse and the next are literally construed it would seem that the kravyad fire was employed for pitryajña. It is possible to hold that kravyād fire was considered as something evil and to be kept distinct from the ordinary or sacrificial fire. 

466. X. 16.11 Sāyana explains on the assumption that the custoord is kavyavābana in this, while the Samhita and the padapātha have bhavyavabana. The Vaj. S. 19.65 and Tai. S. II. 6.12.5 read 'kavyavāhanat M Here apparently at least the flesh-eating fire is admitted not only in the les for the pitrs but also in the rites for gods.

The first two verses refer to the marriage of Vivasvat with the daughter of Tvastr and to the legend of the birth of Yama and Yami from Vivasvat. Both are explained at length in Nir. XII. 10-11. Verses467 7-9 which contain prayers to Sarasvati are almost the same as A. V. 18. 1. 41-43 and are employed by the Kausika-sutra (81.39) in the cremation rite along with A. V.7.68. 1-2 and 18.3.25.

May he who is ahead of you guard you on the way (to heaven)! May god Savitr place you in that place where the doors of good deeds went and dwell. 5. Pūṣan knows all these quarters in order ; may he take us by (a path) most free from danger! He is the bestower of happiness, full of refulgence, he has all heroes with him; may he (Pūsan ) the wise one go in front of us without committing a mistake! 6. Pūṣan exists (stands ) in the fore front of the paths (leading to the world of pitrs ), of the paths leading to heaven and of the paths on the earth. He stands facing both the worlds that are very dear ( to all) and he, the knowing one, travels towards and away from both.

It should be noted that the word 'pitr-yajña' actually occurs in Rg. X. 16. 10. What does it mean? It has to be remembered that the hymns Rg. X. 15-18 refer to rites immediately on the death of a single person. They are not concerned with rites performed for deceased male ancestors long after their deaths. The anxiety (in X. 15-18) seems to be to make the ancient pitrs (styled Barhiṣadah and Agnisvāttāḥ in Rg. X. 15. 3-4, 11) favourably disposed to the recently departed spirit. Havis (sacrifical food such as boiled rice) was offered to the ancient pitrs (Rg. X. 15. 11) who were supposed to have partaken of the food offered (X. 15. 12). The purpose of these Rgvedic hymns is entirely different from the purpose of the mantras in Tai. S. I. 8.5 (which refer to the pitry ajña performed in Sākamedha). As a matter of fact three of the mantras in Tai. S. I. 8. 5 do occur in Rg. X. 57. 3-5 and are employed in the pinda-pitryajña. There is hardly any reason to suppose that the pitryajña in Rg. X, 15. 10 is more ancient than the piņdapitryajña. It is quite possible that both referring as they do to different matters were coeval. 

477. X. 18. 12. This is recited after the bones are covered with particles of dust. It is probable that the particles were poetically described as posts. 

478. X. 18. 13. It looks very likely that a wooden post was employed as a support for the urn that was deposited under ground. 

479. X. 18. 14. This verse is rather obscure and various interpreta tions have been proposed by German scholars (Roth, Grassmann, Ludwig. Geldner and Oldenberg) and others like Whitney and Hopkins. The trans lation is only tentative, but it probably brings out the sense in the context much better than many other interpretations. The idea probably is that the speaker wants to disconnect himself from the dead just as a feathermak become loosened from an arrow that is shot and therefore he states handele wants to stop addressing the dead and close up all connection with the dead The Bșhaddevatā (VII. 18-19) remarks on this verse 'garaia अपहत्येतराणि तु । अहःसु पितरो वधुरित्याशास्तेऽन्त्ययाशिषः ॥

It would be interesting to see how the ceremonies on the death of an āhitāgni are described in the srauta and grhya sūtras. The Āýv. Sr. S. VI, 10 describes what is to be done in case one that has undergone a dikṣā (initiation) for a Soma sacrifice or a sattra dies before the sacrifice is finished. It states "When the diksita is dead, they take out the body by the tirtha, 480 place it on the spot where it was intended that avabhrtha (bath at the end of a soma or sattra sacrifice) was to be taken and deck the body with the decorations that ordinarily are placed on a dead body. They cut the hair (on the head of the corpse, the hair on the lips, the hair on the body and also pare the nails. They apply paste of Nalada (Indian spikenard) to the corpse and throw on it a garland of naladas. Some (having cut open the entrails) take out the fecal matter from them and fill them with prṣadājya ( when clarified butter is mixed with curds it is so called ). They cut off a portion as wide as the foot of the corpse from a new (unworn) garment and cover the dead body with it in such a way that the fringe is towards the west (the head being placed towards the east) and the feet of the corpse are exposed to view. The portion cut off from the piece of cloth is taken by the sons and the like. The deceased man's śrauta fires are placed on the churning sticks (the two aranis). the dead body is taken outside the vedi (fire altar) towards its south, fire is produced by attrition and then the body is burnt therewith. After returning from the cremation, they should finish the work of the day. On the next morning, the recitation of the śāstras, the singing of the stotras and the samstavas (reciting hymns in chorus) should be without repetition and the uttering of the him sound. On the same day before taking up the grahas (cups), the priests come out by the tirtha, go round the place of cremation with the right hand turned away ( from the place ) and sit round it in the following manner viz. the hotr priest sits to the west ( of the place of cremation), the adhvaryu to the north, and the sama priests to the west of the adhvaryu (and the brahmā priest to the south). Then the sāma priests sing in a low voice the verse beginning with "ayam gauh prśnirakramīt.' When the singing is finished the hotr walks round the place of cremation thrice with his left

The Sat. Br. (XII, 5.2.5) refers to the practice of cleansing the deceased of all foul matter, but does not approve of it. It recommends 'having washed him out inside he anoints with ghee and thus makes the body sacrificially pure.' आयं गौः पृश्निरक्रमीत--is the first verse of the hymn Rg.X. 189. 1-3 which are alsos.V.

S. 25.7 does the same but more briefly. Kāt. (25.7.18 ) refers to the cutting of hair and nails and taking out fecal matter and Kauś. ( 80. 13-16), Śān. Śr. 4. 14. 4–5 also speak of the cutting of hair, of bathing the dead body, applying paste and putting garlands. The Baud. P. S. (1.2) refers to these and adds that if they cut open his entrails from the right side they again sew it with darbha grass or they may simply wash the body (without taking out the fecal matter ), cover the body with a piece of cloth, deck it, remove the body by the way between the vedi and utkara, place it on a couch (āsandi) over which a black antelope skin was spread with the head to the south, put Nalada garland on it and cover it with an unworn piece of cloth (as in Āśv. Śr, above ). Sat. Śr. 28. 1. 22 and G. P. S. I. 10-14 contain similar provisions adding that the toes of the feet and thumbs of the corpse are tied with a white thread or the fringe of a garment (baddhvā daśenāngusthau-pādayoḥ pānyosca, G, P.S. I, 12 ) and that the āsandi (a small couch or chair on which the corpse was carried ) was to be of udumbara wood. The Kausikasūtra (80, 3.3-45) refers to numerous stanzas from A. V. that are to be recited in kindling the funeral fire and offering oblations, viz. 18. 2. 4 and 36; 18. 3. 4; 18. 1. 49-50, 58; 18. 1. 41-43; 7. 68. 1-2; 18. 3. 25; 18.2. 4-18 (omitting 18.2.10); 18.4.1-15 &c. Compare SBE. vol. XI p. XLI for Budhist practics. 

The Asv. gr. 482 (IV. 1 and 2) prescribes in general the cere monies on the death of an āhitāgni, while the Āśv. Sr. S. quoted 

482, It deserves to be noted that the numbering of the sūtras in Asv. gr. IV. 1-2 differs in different editions considerably. The rules about the selection of the site for cremation are ancient. The Sat. Br. XIJI. 8.1 and Kāt. Sr. XXI. 3,15-26 also lay down elaborate rules. The latter may be set out here: 'the site for cremation should be one surrounded by a thicket of trees, but it should be so open that the sun shines directly on it at mid-day. It should be saltish land or land sloping to the north or it may be all level land. Some say that it should slope towards the south. The spot should be such that the houses in the village cannot be seen from it and should be at a distance from the road and from the vata, pippala, tilvaka, haridru, sphūrjaka, bibhidaka and other trees that have an evil name (such as śleṣmātaka and kovidāra). The Sat. Br. XIII. 8.1.16 names all these trees that are to be avoided. The spot should be such that 4 pile of wood (as directed in Kāt. Sr. 25. 7. 16-17) can be constructed thereon. It should be a pleasing one and should have a thicket of various trees to its west or in default, water, which may be to its west or north. Thespot should have streams or holes and grass growing thereon. The Kāt., Sr. S.

above deals with what should be done in case the ahitāgni dies while engaged in a Soma or other sacrifice. The Aśv. gr. re marks 'when an āhitāgni dies, one (a son or other relative) should arrange to have a piece of land dug up to the south-east or south-west at a place sloping towards the south or south-east, or according to some towards the south-west. The piece of land dug up should be of the length of a man with upraised arms, of the breadth of one vyāma483 and one vitasti (twelve finger breadths) in depth. The cemetery (smaśāna) should484 be free (open) on all sides. It should abound in herbs, but plants with thorns and with milky juice (should be dug out) as stated before (in Aśv. gr. II. 7.5 about văstu-pariksā). From which the waters flow on all sides (that is the spot should be a little higher than the surrounding ground); this should be a characteristic required for that (kind of) cemetery where (the body) is to be burnt. They should cut off the hair on the head, the lips and the body and pare the nails (of the deceased); this has been declared already (in Asv. Sr. VI. 10.2). They should make provision for plenty of sacrificial grass and clarified butter. In this (funeral rite) they pour clarified butter into curds. This is the prṣadājya used 

(Continued from the last page ) 21. 3. 27 adds that a bamboo staff with a bundle of grass at its top is carried to the cremation ground and held by a person to the north of the ground while the rites go on and that it is brought back to the house and kept raised at the house. The ground is measured and pegs of palāša, sami, varana and a stone are driven into the ground from the east, north, west and south in order. The Sat. Br. XIII. 8. 4.1 mentions pegs (sanku). San. Sr. (IV. 14, 6-9) states that the ground of cremation slopes to the south or south-east, that the ground is swept with a palasa branch with the verse 'apeta' (Rg. X. 14. 9), then it is cleared with the sphya and sprinkled with water and the pile of wood is made to face south-east.

After these aged persons, in odd numbers, men and women not going together, carry the dead body. Some say that the dead body) should be carried in a cart with a seat drawn485 by oxen. Some prescribe that a she-animal, either a cow486 or a she-goat, of one colour or of a dark colour (should be taken to the cemetery).

Then follow the relations (of the deceased) with their yajñopavitas brought low (round their body) and with the top knot untied dishevelled ), the older ones going first, the younger ones last. Having thus arrived at the spot (of cremation), the performer (of cremation rites ) while walking three times round the spot (for cremation) with his left side turned towards it, sprinkles water on it with a śami twig with the verse 'apeta vita vi ca sarpatātah' (Rg.

To the south-east on a slightly raised corner (of the spot for cremation ), he ( son or the like ) places the Āhavaniya fire, to the north-west the Gārhapatya fire and to the south-west the Daksina fire. Then a person that knows (how to prepare a funeral pile) collects a pile of fuel between the fires (on the dug-up spot). Then the performer of the rites spreads barhis (kušas) and a black antelope skin with the hairy part outside on the pile, ( the relatives ) place the dead body thereon carry ing it by way of the north side of the Gārhapatya fire and turn ing its head towards the Ahavaniya fire.

The wife's brother-in-law 487 (husband's brother) or a representative of the husband or a pupil (of the deceased) or an old servant (slave) should make her rise (from the pile) with the mantra 'udirṣva nāryabhi jivalokam' (Rg. X. 18. 8); the performer (of the rites) should mutter this verse if a sudra (servant) makes her rise and he takes away the bow with the verse dhanur-hastādādadā no' (Rg. X. 18. 9). It has been stated (above what is to be done in case a śūdra (should per form this act). Having strung the bow he should before the piling up of the things (mentioned below on the dead body) is done, break the bow to pieces and throw it on the pile. 488 He then should put the following sacrificial implements (on the dead body) viz. into the right hand the spoon called Juhū, in the left hand the spoon Upabhrt, on his right side the Sphya (wooden sword), on his left side the Agnihotrahavaņi (the ladle with which the Agnihotra offerings were offered into fire), on his chest, head and teeth respectively the dhruvā (the big sacrificial ladle), the dishes (or the ka pālas ), the pressing stones (used for pressing out Soma juice in a soma sacrifice), on the two nostrils the two small ladles (sruva), on the ears the two Prāśitra-haranas, 489 if there be only one then breaking

The same sūtra (28. 2. 22) says that the wife may be made to lie down near the corpse after the latter is placed on the pyre or before (as it appears to prefer).

Those of the sacrificial implements which have a hollow (into which a fluid can be poured) are filled with Prṣadājya. The son (of the deceased) should take the upper and the lower mill-stones for himself and the implements made of copper, iron and earthenware 490. 

The Sat. Br. XII, 5. 2, 14 first states that sacrificial imple ments made of stone or earthenware should be donated to a brāhmana but people regard the latter as a corpse-bearer (and so) they should be thrown into water.491 Taking out the omentum (vapā) of the Anustarani she-animal he should cover therewith the head and the mouth (of the deceased) with the verse 'Agner varma' (Rg. X. 16. 7). Taking out the two kidneys (vrkkau) of the animal he should deposit them into the 

490. It should be noted that there are some variations in the state ments about the sacrificial implements made here and in the Sat Br. XII, 5. 2, Sat. Sr. 28. 2. 23-50, Kāt. Sr. 25. 7. 21-33, Kaus. 81. 1-19, Baud. P.S. I. 8. 11-1. 9. 7. San. Sr. IV. 14. 18–36. For example, the Sān. Sr. (IV. 16. 21-31) prescribes that the Agnihotrahavani is placed on the throat and the two aranis on the private parts, while Āsv. gr. places the agnihotra havani on the left side and the samyā on private parts. Sabara quotes several times a passage which says 'They burn the abitāgni with his (vedic) fires and sacrificial implements' (ahitāgnim-agoibhir dahanti yajñapātraisca) on Jai. IV. 1.9. VI. 6. 34, XI. 3.34. Those words occur also in Baud. P. S. III. 1.9. Jai. XI. 3. 34 states the proposition that the cremation of the sacri ficer with the sacrificial implements is what is called pratipattikarman (the final disposal) of the yajñapātras.

He puts the heart of the animal) on his heart and according to some also two lumps of flour (of rice or barley ); according to others only if there are no kidneys.492 Having deposited the whole animal limb by limb (on corres ponding limbs of the dead body ) and having covered it with its own hide he recites when the Pranītā water is being carried forward, by way of invocation the mantra 'imam agne' (Rg. X. 16. 8). Bending his left knee he should offer into the Dakṣiņa fire oblations of clarified butter with the formula 'to Agni svāhā! To Soma svāhāl To the world svāhā! To Anumati svāhā!' A fifth oblation (is to be offered) on the chest of the deceased with the formula ‘from this one, indeed thou hast been born! May he now be born out of thee, N. N.! To the heavenly world, svāhā' (Vāj. S. 35.22). He gives the order 

Light the fire together.' Then the Āśv. gr. (IV. 4. 2-5 ) states what one has to understand if the Ahavaniya or Gārhapatya or Dakṣiņa fire reaches the dead body first or if all the fires reach the body at the same moment; while the body is burning he recites over it the same texts (Rg. X. 14.7 and others quoted above in n. 481 from Asv. Sr. sutra). Being cremated by a person who knows this he goes to the heavenly world together with the smoke (of the funeral pile)-thus it is known (in the Sruti). After he has recited the verse ime jivāh' (Rg. X, 18. 3) they (all relatives) turn round from right to left and go away without looking back. When they have come to a place where there is standing water, having once plunged into it and raised their heads out of it they pour one handful of water, pro nounce the gotra name and the proper name (of the deceased), 

492. According to Kat. Sr. quoted above in n. 486 the Anustarani animal was to be struck behind the ear and killed. According to Jātükarnya the several limbs of the animal were to be placed on the corresponding limbs of the dead body. But Kat. disapproves of this since when burnt there may be a doubt (in collecting bones) whether they are of the deceased or of the animal (and so only the flesh of the animal was to be placed on the limbs according to Kāt.). Compare Sat. Br. XII. 5. 9-12 for similar remarks. Ašv. 81. IV. 2.4 (as interpreted by Nārāyana) itself shows that there was an option) viz, that the animal may be killed or let off and donated to a brasaana 

o Baud. P. S. I. 10. 2). The San. Sr. (IV. 14. 14-15) stated that the kidneys were to be taken from the killed or livi 

to be taken from the killed or living animal from behind and/ 

tly heated on the Daksina fire were to be placed in the two handed of the deceased with the two mantras 'ati drava' (Rg. X. 14. 10-11)

When they have come to the houses they touch a stone, the fire, cow-dung, fried barley, sesame seeds and water. Compare Sat. Br.

Devala provides that when using ordinary fire, one should avoid taking the fire from a cāņdāla or any unclean fire or the fire in the room of a freshly delivered woman or the fire of a patita or fire from a funeral pyre. 496 The Pitrdayitā states that the mantra 'asmāt tvam &c.' was not to be recited when the deceased was a person

S. 35. 6 and facing the south plunge into water and pour out one libation of water with joined hands. The Āp. Dh, S.

In the case of a child's death before one year, the parents and those who carry the child's body have to bathe. All the above should have dishevelled hair, should throw dust in the hair, wear only one garment, turn their faces to the south, plunge into water, offer water to the dead thrice and then sit down on the bank (of the river or pond), then come to the village and do what the women tell them to do (such as touching fire and bull &c.).

VI, 10.1). The G. P. S.

The performer while standing should drop behind him the jar of water.

The Varāha purāņa prescribes that a Paurānic mantra should be recited, that the performer should go round the pyre and apply the kindled fire towards the part of the pyre where the head is placed. 499 

In modern times the procedure of cremation is generally on the lines of that described in the Asv. gr. cited above and the procedure described in the Garudapurāṇa II, 4. 41 ff. The following is a summary of the procedure set out in the Antyesti paddhati of Nārāyanabhatta which is generally followed by Rgveding in Western India. The dead body is washed with water, is decked with a tilaka on the forehead, is clothed in a garment, is covered with a paste of Jatāmāmsi and a garland of naladas is placed round its neck. Then the performer washes his own feet, sips water, performs prāņāyāma without Vedic mantra, then makes a Sankalpa ( as in note 500 ),500 he wears his sacred thread under the left shoulder (and on the right shoulder) and prays to the earth with the mantra 'upasarpa' (Rg. X. 18.10); he then thrice goes round the place dug up (for cremation) and sprinkles water with a sami branch at the end of the mantra 

apeta' (Rg. X. 14. 9). This mantra is repeated thrice. Then he draws three lines on the ground with an iron piece or kuģa roots saying 'I draw a line for Yama, the lord of cremation,' 'I draw a line for Kala, lord of &c' 'I draw a line for Mrtyu, lord of &c.' Then he throws into the dug-up ground pieces of gold and sesame and water mixed with sesame in the middle of the dug up spot for Yama, to the north for Kāla and to the south for

Mrtyu (each being associated with pitrs, the formula being 

Yamāya dahanapataye pitpbhyah svadhā namah'). He puts sesame in the mouth of the corpse and prepares a funeral pile sufficient for burning the body by means of sacrificial wood brought by the castemen of the deceased. On that pile he spreads kusa grass and over the latter black antelope skin with the hair outside. Then the corpse is carried to the north of the fire and is placed on the funeral pile with the head to the south. To the north of the dead body, he makes the wife of the deceased sit down. Then the husband's brother, pupil or an old servant makes her get up with the mantra "udirṣva' (Rg. X. 18. 8). Then the performer puts pieces of gold in the seven holes of the body (vide above note 491) or drops of clarified butter. He then throws on the body of the departed sesame anointed with ghee, he performs parisamuhana (wiping with the wet hand) of the fire, then paristaraņa (strewing darbha grass) round the fire together with the funeral pile) and paryuksaņa (sprinkling water) and brings to the south of the fire the vessels viz. prokṣaņi, sruva, camasa and the vessel containing clarified butter. Then he puts water in the camasa (cup), covers it with darbha grass and carries it forward and invokes the camasa with Rg. X. 16.8 (imam-agne &c.). He makes a sankalpa that he would wait upon (or worship) the dead, takes two fuel sticks and offers them 

into fire and performs the worship of Agni, Kāma, Loka and Anumati by offering clarified butter in fire with the appropriate formula (viz. agnaye svāhā, agnaya idam na mama). Then offers on the chest of the deceased clarified butter (or prsadājya) (according to some) with the mantra 'asmādvai &c. (vide above note 498). Then he prepares apūpas (balls) with barley flour and mixes them with prsadājya and places portions of the balls on the five parts viz. forehead, mouth, the two arms and chest with the following mantras viz, Rg. X. 16. 7 (for the ball on forehead and mouth), Rg. X. 14, 10 (for the two arms) and Rg. X. 14. 11 (for the chest). Then he makes the fire flame up with the mantra Rg. X. 16. 9 (kravyādam-agnim) towards the head of a male (and the feet of a woman). Then he should repeat certain mantras while the body is being burnt viz. Rg. X. 14.7-8, Rg. X. 14. 10-11, Rg. X, 16.1-6, X. 17.3-6. X. 18.10-13, X. 154. 1-5, X, 14. 12. While muttering these mantras he should throw sesame on the body that is being burnt. Then the pxrformer should take a jar (full of water) on his left shoulder, should make a hole in it on the back of the jar with a broken buf grooth stone. He should go round thrice with the left towards the

burning body from the spot where the feet of the corpse lie and mutter certain mantras. The jar is struck thrice. All the sagotra relatives go round the burning corpse. Then the jar is completely broken near that part of the funeral pyre where the head rests. The relatives without looking back turn to the left and come out of the cemetery with the young est members first. The performer recites Rg. X. 18. 3 (ime jīvā &c.). The relatives repair to a spot where water is flow ing, wearing only one garment and with faces to the south and hair dishevelled, plunge into the water once, sip water, place on the bank that stone (aśman) with which holes were made in the jar, offer water mixed with sesame on that stone with folded hands with the words 'O departed, of such a gotra and of such a name! May this water mixed with sesame reach you'. The performer offers water with the uttariya for allay ing the thirst (of the departed) due to the burning. 

Many rules were prescribed as regards the carrying of the dead body. It has been seen above that the corpse was carried in a cart or on a couch by the relatives or by the ser yants (dāsas). Some sūtras, smrtis, commentaries and other works lay down many other rules here. The Rāmāyana (Ayodhyā 76.13 ff) states that on the death of Dasaratha his Vedic fires were carried by his priests before the corpse, that the dead body was placed in a palanquin (sibikā), that his servants carried it and that coins of gold and clothes were thrown about on the road in front of the bier (for the poor). The general rule was that members of the three higher varnas alone should carry to the cemetery a dead body belonging to any one of those varnas and a sūdra should not carry the dead body of a man of a higher caste (when there were men of the caste of the dead available) nor should a man of one of the three higher varnas carry the dead body of a sūdra, and that the impurity in the case of a südra carrying a dead dvijāti or a dvijāti carrying a sūdra's body is determined by the caste of the dead man. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 19. 1-4, Gaut. Dh. S. 14. 29, Manu 5. 104, Yāj. III. 26, Parāśara III. 43-45. A brahmacārin was not permitted to be a carrier of the dead body of a person or relative even of his own caste, except his parents, guru, ācārya and upādhyāya and he was not guilty of breaking his vows of student-hood if he carried the bodies of any one of the five mentioned above. Vide Vas. 23, 7, Manu 01 5. 91, Yāj. III. 15, Laghu-Hārīta 92-93, Brahmapurāņa (q. by Par. M. I. 2 p. 278). Guru, ācārya and Upādhyāya are defined

Rules about carrying a corpse 

215 

by Yāj. I. 34–35. If a brahmacārin carried the corpse of any one except the above five he was held to have swerved from his vrata and he had to undergo the expiation for vratalopa. Manu 5.103 and Yāj. III. 13-14 state that those who merely carry a dead body of their own caste should bathe with the clothes on, then bite off nimba leaves, should perform ācamana, touch fire, water, cow dung, white mustard, place slowly a foot on a stone and then enter their house. It being the duty of sapindas 501 to carry the dead body of their relative they, after doing so, had simply to bathe, to touch fire and drink clarified butter for being pure (Gaut. 14. 29, Yāj. III. 26, Manu IV. 103, Parāśara III. 42, Devala q. by Par. M. 1.2, p. 277, Hārīta q. by Aparārka p. 871). Carrying the dead body of a brāhmana who has no relatives is highly extolled by Parāsara (III. 39-41) who says that a person, that thus carries the dead body of a brāh mana, secures at each footstep the reward of the performance of a sacrifice and he becomes pure at once simply by plunging into water and performing prānāyāma, while Manu (5. 101-102) prescribes that if one carries the dead body of a person who is not a sapinda through affection he becomes pure after three days. The Hāralatā p. 121 quotes the Adipurāṇa that if a ksatriya or vaiśya cremates the dead body of a poor brāhmaṇa or of a ksatriya who has lost everything or of a poor vaisya, he secures great merit and becomes pure at once after a bath. Even now generally (particularly in villages) men of the same caste carry or follow a dead body and are held to be purified by a bath with clothes on. The medieval commentaries like the Mitākṣarā stuck strictly to the extreme exclusiveness of caste by prescribing 'if a man 502 carries a dead body through affection, eats food in that family and dwells in their house he is under impurity for ten days; if he simply stays with the dead man's family but does not eat their food he is impure for three days; these rules apply when the carrier is of

The Kūrmapurāṇa prescribes that if a brāhmana carries the dead body of a brāhmana for a fee or from other interested motive he becomes impure for ten days, a ksatriya, vaisya and Śūdra doing the same becomes impure for 12, 15 or 30 days and the Viṣnupurāņa says that the person carrying a dead body for a fee has to become impure for the period of impurity prescribed for a man of that caste. It may be stated that these rules about impurity on the ground of carrying or following the carrying of a dead body of another caste are no longer enforced and it is extremely doubtful whether they were ever strictly enforced or followed. Harita 503 prescribes that a dead body should not be carried through the midst of a village if while going to the cemetery a village comes in the way, but it should be carried away from it. Manu, 5.92 and Viddha-Hārīta IX. 100-101 prescribed that the dead body of a śūdra, vaisya, ksatriya and a brāhmana was to be taken out respectively by the southern, western, northern and eastern gates of the town or village. It was provided by Yama and the Garudapurāṇa II. 4.56-57 504 that the fuel for the funeral pyre should not be carried (for higher varnas ) to the cemetery by a sūdra and if a śūdra did go the deceased would always remain in the state of preta. The Hāralatā (p. 121) says that if firewood is carried by śūdras still the pyre should be made by brāhmaṇas only (for a brāhmana's body). The smrtis and purāṇas provide that the corpse 505 should be first bathed with water and then cremated, that the corpse should never be burned naked, but that it should be covered with cloth. decked with flowers and have fragrant unguents (sandalwood

The Brahmapurana (q. by Suddhiprakāśa p. 159) states that when carrying a dead body to the cemetery, a great deal of noise should be created by means of the four kinds of instru ments, 506 

There were differing rules laid down about vapana (shaving) for the performer as an auxiliary (anga) of the rite of cremation, after the cremation and bath thereafter. A smrti text provideg 507 'shaving of the head and moustaches is declared in seven cases. viz, on the Ganges, at the Bhāskarakṣetra, on the death of the mother or father or guru, on consecrating the srauta fires and in a Soma sacrifice'. The A. K, D. (p. 19) prescribes that the son or other performer of the rites of cremation should first perform vapana and then bathe, then carry the dead body to a sacred spot, bathe it there, or if such a spot is not at hand should invoke the presence of the Ganges, Gayā and other tirthas in the water to be used for washing the dead body, then anoint it with ghee or sesame oil, again bathe it and put on it a fresh garment. should deck it with ya'nopavīta, gopicandana, garland of basil leaves and then should apply to the wbole body fragrant subst ances like sandalwood paste, camphor, saffron, musk &c. But if the cremation took place at night, there was to be no vapana at night, but on the next day.508 Other smrtis allowed vapana on the 2nd, 3rd, 5th or 7th or any following day up to the offering of śrāddha on the 11th day.509 Ap.

provides 510 vapana for all sapiņdas that are younger than the deceased. The Madanapārijāta holds that the performer of crema tion rites had to undergo vapana on the first day and also on the expiry of the period of impurity, while the Suddhiprakāśa (p. 162) following the Mit on Yāj. III 17 states that the day on which vapana is to be undergone is determined by the usage of each country. This difference in usages has been even judicially noticed. In Chandra choora Deo v. Bibhuti Bhushan Deva A.T.R. 1945 Patna p. 211 at p. 219 it has been stated that according to the Benares School the person who performs the cremation shaves his head at the time of cremation, whereas under the Mithilā school there is no such shaving at that time. 

The Garudapurāṇa (II. 4. 67-69) provides that loud weeping may be indulged in when the body is burning but there should be no weeping after cremation and the offering of water to the departed 

There was some difference of opinion as to the offering of water (udakakriyā or udakadāna) to the deceased by his sapindas and samānodakas. Āśv. gr.quoted above (p. 209) speaks of offering water once, but the Sat. Sr. 28. 2. 72 and others prescribe that water mixed with sesame is offered thrice with joined hands on the day of death to the deceased after reciting his gotra and name and every day thereafter up to the 11th.511 Gaut. Dh, S. 14. 38, Vas. 4. 12 prescribe that water should be offered by sapindas to the deceased with their faces to the south on the first, third, seventh and ninth days of death and Haradatta says that in all 75 añjalis of water were to be offered (three on 1st day, 9 on 3rd, 30 on 7th and 33 on 9th ), but that the usage in his country was that on the first day water was offered three times with joined hands and then one more añjali on each succeeding day from the 2nd.

prescribe that water and pinda were to be offered to the deceased for ten days.512 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 202 ) quotes verses from Grhya-parisista, one of which says that some declare that only ten añjalis were to be offered, some say 100 were to be offered and others that 55 were to be offered and that one should follow the usage settled in one's vedic Sākhā. The Asv. gr. parisista 3. 4 has a similar rule in proge. The Garudapurāṇa ( Pretakhanda chap. 5 verses 22-23 ) also refers to the offering of 10, 55, or 100 añjalis. Some smrtis prescribed that the number of añjalis of water were dependent on the caste of the deceased. Pracetas (q. by Mit. on Yāj. ITI, 4 ) provides that 10, 12, 15, 30 añjalis should be respectively offered to a deceased person of the brāhmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra varna. Yama (verses 92-94 ) states how water is to be offered to the deceased standing in navel-deep water and (98) pre scribes that water is to be offered in water to gods and pitrs but on the ground to those that died without upanayana being performed. In a smrti quoted by Devayājñika 513 it is stated that six pindas were to be offered from the day of death as follows: at the place where the death occurred, at the door of the house, where four roads meet, where the funeral procession on the way to the cemetery rested, on the pile of wood arranged for burning (cita), and at the time of the collection of the burnt bones. It was further provided that for the benefit of the departed a lamp fed by sesame oil was to be kept burning continuously for ten days after death and an earthenware vessel was to be kept filled with water and a handful of cooked rice was to be offered on the ground at the time of the mid-day meal after uttering the name and gotra of the departed. This was called pātheya śrāddha because it helped the departed to go on his way from the earth to the world of the departed (vide Dharmasindhu p. 463). According to some of the digests

a sraddha called Nagna-pracchādana was to be performed on the day of the death of a person after his sapindas undergo shaving and bath, enter the village and the house. It consists in filling a jar with grains of rice wound round with a piece of cloth and putting clarified butter in a vessel of bell-metal and some gold (or coins) thereon according to one's ability. The whole was to be given to a poor brāhmaṇa of good family after remembering Visņu for the benefit of the departed. Vide Smrti muktāphala (on śr.) pp. 595-596, Sn. C. (on Aśauca p. 176 ). 

The smrtis and purāṇas (like Kūrma, uttarardha 23.70) prescribe that after offering with joined hands water to the deceased a ball of rice or barley flour with sesame was to be presented on darbha grass. There are two views on this point, According to Yāj. III. 16 a pinda was to be offered for three days after death according to the procedure prescribed for Pinda-pitr-yajña (such as wearing of the sacred thread on the right shoulder and under the left shoulder ), while according to Viṣnu 19. 13 one pinda was to be offered every day as long as impurity on death lasted. The pinda was to be offered on darbhas spread on the ground if the deceased had his upanayana performed, but without mantras or may be offered on a stone.514 While water could be offered by any and every sapinda, pinda was to be offered only by the son (and when there were many sons, by the eldest if free from defect); in default of a son the nearest sapinda like a brother or brother's son was to offer it and in default of such then the sapindas of the mother (maternal uncle, his son or the like ) could 515 offer it. Even when pindas were to be offered for three days or āśauca lasted only for 3 days the pindas were prescribed to be ten by Śatātapa and Paraskara distributed them as follows: three on the first day, four on the 2nå and 3 on the third and Daksa 516 distri buted them as follows: one on the first day, four on the 2nd and five on the 3rd. Pāraskara prescribed that 10, 12, 15, 30 pindas were to be offered according to the varna of the deceased. In the case cited above from A. I. R. 1945 Patna p. 211 at p. 219 it has been stated that according to the Benares school 4, 5 or 6

Views on pindas at cremation 

piņdas are offered at the time of cremation, while according to the Mithilā school only one pinda is offered. Everybody, whether a person of the same gotra as the deceased or of another gotra, had to carry out all the rites up to the tenth day when he once began them on the day of death, as stated by the Grhya-parisista 517 and Garudapurāṇa. It is further prescribed that when the funeral rites are begun by a person and then a nearer relative such as a son comes, even then the former is to carry on all the rites up to the 10th day, but the rites of the 11th and later days are to be performed by the son and in default of him by a near sapinda. The Matsyapurāņa states 518 that piņdas should be offered to the deceased for twelve days; they become his food on his journey (to the other world) and they give him satisfaction; since the deceased is taken to the abode of departed spirits after twelve days, he (his spirit) sees his house, sons and wife for twelve days. Rsyasrnga quoted by Aparārka (p. 889 ) specifies the limbs of an ethereal body with which the deceased is endowed on each day of the ten days after death when a pinda is offered. The Garudapurāṇa (pretakhanda chap. 5. 33-36) says the same. 

Just as sapindas of the same gotra and samānodakas were bound to offer water to the deceased, a person was bound to offer water to his maternal grandfather and to the two further ancestors and to his ācārya on their death. Every man, if he 90 desired (i. e. he was under no religious duty), could offer water to his friend, to his married sister or daughter, to his sister's son, father-in-law and his sacrificial priest on their death (Pār, gr. III, 10, Sankha-Likhita, Yāj. 519 ILI. 4). Pāraskara (III. 10) refers to a peculiar practice. When the sapindas are about to enter water for bathing and thereafter offering water to the deceaged they pray to their relatives or brother-in-law for water with the words 'we shall perform udakakriyā', where-upon

the other replies 'do so but don't come again (with a similar request), if the deceased was less than one hundred years of age, but the reply would be simply do so if the deceased was hundred years of age or more.520 The G. P. S. (1, 4.4-6) has a somewhat similar symbolic dialogue. A king's officer, a sagotra or a brother-in-law takes a branch having thorns and prevents them from entering water with the words 'don't enter'; then the sapindas should reply 'we shall not again enter water'. The probable significance of this was that they thereby would be able to escape from another death in the family soon after. 

There were rules prohibiting certain persons from offering water to the deceased and also directing that water should not be offered to certain deceased persons. Impotent 521 persons and the like, thieves of gold, vrātyas, those who follow forbidden conduct and women that kill their own foetus or husband and that drink the kind of liquor (forbidden to them) should not offer water to a deceased person. Yāj. (III. 6) provides that water should not be offered to and no āśauca observed for heretics, for those who do not belong to one of the four āśramas, to thieves, to women who kill their husbands or who are guilty of prostitu tion or who drink surā, or who commit suicide. Manu (V. 89-- 90) is to the same effect. Gaut. Dh, S. 522 14, 11 provides that in the case of those who start (through anger) on the Great

To whom no water is to be offered 

223 

Journey, who commit suicide by fasting or by means of a weapon or by fire, by poison, in water, by hanging or falling from a precipice or tree, there is no cremation, no āśauca, no offering of water or pinda. Haradatta on Gaut, 14. 11 quotes three verses froni Brahmapurāṇa that those who die of a brāhmana's curse or black magic and those who are patitas are dealt with in the same way. But Angiras (q. by Mit, on Yāj. III. 6) says that if one dies by water or fire or the like through inadvertence, there was āśauca for him and udakakriya was performed. Vide Vaik. Sm. S. V. 11 for a long list of persons who must not be cremated. In the Mahābharata the rites of cremation have been described frequently e. g: the cremation of Pāndu in Adiparva, chap. 127 (the body was carried in a sibikā covered on all sides, there were musical instruments, the royal parasol and chowries were carried in the procession, distribution of wealth to mendicants, carrying the dead body to the bank of the Ganges on a charming sylvan spot, bathing the body, applying sandalwood paste to it); of Drona in Strīparva, chap. 23.38-42 (three Sāmans were sung, his pupils with Drona's wife in front went round the funeral pyre, going to the Ganges); of Bhisma in Anušāsana 169.10-19 (fragrant resins were used on the pyre, his body was covered with fine clothes and flowers, an umbrella and chowries were held over the body, Kaurava women fanned the body with fans, sāmans were sung ); of Vasudeva in Mausalaparva 7. 19-25; of killed warriers in general in Strīparva, chap. 26. 28-43 and of Kunti, Dhrtarāstra and Gāndhāri in Aśramavāsikaparva, chap. 39. In the Rāmāyana ( Ayodhyā, chap. 76 verses 16-20 ), it is said that the funeral pyre for Daśaratha was made with sandalwood, aguru and fragrant resins, with Sarala, Padmaka and Devadāru (pine) wood and various fragrant substances were heaped thereon, then Daśaratha's body was placed on the pyre and that Kausalya and other women followed the corpse in śibikās and conveyances according to their status. 

If an āhitāgni died away from home, the Sat. Br. (XII. 5.1.13-14) provides that, having brought his bones home they were to be spread on a black antelope skin and arranged sin imitation of the human frame, were to be covered with wool and ghee and burnt with his srauta fires and sacrificial Imple ments. Similar rules are laid down in Kāt. Sr. 25.8-9, Band. P, S, III.8, Gobhilasmrti III, 47, Vas. Dh, S. IV, 37,

If even the bones could not be found, then the sūtras follow ing the Ait. Br. (chap. 32.1) and similar ancient works523 provide that on a skin of black antelope one should make the effigy of a human frame with palāśa stalks (leaves ) 360 in 524 number, the effigy should be bound round with woollen thread, should be covered with yava flour mixed with water and anointed with clarified butter and cremated with his fires and sacrificial implements. The Brahmapurāņa (q. by Suddhi prakāśa p. 187) contains similar rules about burning an effigy and ordains three days' impurity thereafter. Acc. to a smrti (q. by Aparārka p. 545 ), the palāśa leaves were to be 362. They were to be distributed according to Baud. P.S. and Gaut. P.S. as follows: 40 represent the head, 10 the neck, 20 the chest, 30 the abdomen ( udara), 50 each of the arms, 10 the fingers of the two hands, 170 each of the two legs, 10 the toes of the feet, 8 the male organ, 12 the testicles. This is also the enumeration in

It may be stated here that all the sūtras and smrtis do not entirely agree as to the number of palāśa leaves taken as representing the several parts of the body, as may be seen from a comparison of the Sān. Sr. quoted in the note with Baud. P. S. set out here. A. smrti quoted by Aparārka (p. 545 ) gives the numbers as follows: 32 for the head, 60 for the neck, 80 for the chest, 20 for the hip and loins, 20 each for the two arms, 10 for fingers, 6 for testicles, 4 for the penis, 60 for the two thighs, 20 for the knees, 20 for the

Burning of Effigy with palāśa stalks 225 lower parts of the legs, 10 for toes of the feet. Jātūkarnya (q. by Aparārka p. 545 ) and Bhavisyapurana (q. by Suddhi prakāśa p. 187) say that when a son does not hear for 15 years about his father who had gone to a distant land, he should perform the cremation of the effigy (called 'ākrtidahana'). Bịhaspati advises waiting for 12 years before resorting to ākṣtidahana (Suddhipr. p. 187). The Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra V. 12 regards the burning of the effigy as a meritorious act for every one and does not restrict it to the case where the body or bones are not found The Suddhiprakāśa p. 187 quotes several verses from the Brahmapurāṇa that the procedure of burning an effigy of palāśa stalks was to be followed even in the case of one who has not consecrated Srauta fires and āśauca for three days has to be observed, while the aśauca for burning the effigy of an āhitāgni was ten days. 

It is further provided in Sat. Śr. 29. 4. 41, Baud. P.S. (III. 7. 4) and Garudapurāṇa II, 4. 169-70 that, if after the effigy is cremated in the belief that a person died in a foreign land, he returns alive, then he is plunged in a pit containing clarified butter and then he comes out of it, takes a bath, then all the saņskāras from jātakarma are performed on him, then he marries the same wife again or if she be dead, he may marry another girl, then consecrate again srauta fires. Some sütras provide that if the wife of an āhitāgni dies before him, he may, if he so desires, cremate her with his srauta fires or he may cremate her with fire prepared from cowdung and some easily inflammable things (like straw) placed in three sthālis (cooking pots 526). Manu (V. 167-168) provides that if the savarna and virtuous wife of a twice-born person who had consecrated sacred srauta fires died before him she was to be cremated with his fires (srauta and smārta) and with the sacrificial implements. Then he may marry again and consecrate srauta or smārta fires again. To the same effect are Yaj. I. 89, Baud.

the effect that if a person keeps the same srauta fires after the death of his wife they are (impure like) the fires used for burning a corpse and adds that even if a brāhmana āhitāgni had a wife of the ksatriya class and she died before him, she was to be cremated with his srauta fires. This view is opposed to that of many other commentators and he explains Manu V. 167 (where 'savarnām' occurs ) as merely illustra tive and that if it were interpreted as restricted to a savarna wife alone, there would be the fault of vākyabheda. Some of the smrtis provide that he may remain a widower and perform his Agnihotra by having a golden effigy of the wife or one made of kuģa grass, as Rāma did. Vide Gobhilasmrti III, 528 9-10, Vrddha-Harita XI. 214. If the householder did not marry again (when his wife died before him and was cremated with his srauta fires) and did not consecrate fresh vedic fires he was to be cremated with ordinary fire. If the householder was un able to marry again, he may cremate his wife with fire kindled by means of the kindling sticks (aranis) and keep his srauta fires and carry on agnihotra with the image or effigy of the wife. If the āhitāgni died first and his wife then died as a widow she was to be cremated with fire (nirmanthya) kindled by attrition of the arañis. Vide Baud. P. S. II, 4, 6-8, Kāt. Śr. 29.4. 34-35, and Trikānda-mandana II, 121,528a When the wife was crema ted the mantra 'Asmāttvam-abhijātosi' quoted above was not to be recited (vide Gobhilasmrti III. 52). It was only a virtu ous wife and not an unchaste one that was cremated with srauta or smārta fire (Gobhilasmrti III. 53). Kratu (q. by

If an āhitāgni became patita or guilty of suicide in various ways or met death by challenging animals or snakes, his srauta fires were to be cast into water and smārta fire was to be cast on the place where four roads meet (or in water), his sacrificial implements were to be burnt (a smrti q. by Par.

Pāraskara-gr. 5280 III, 10, Yāj. III. 1, Manu V.68-69, Yama and some others provide that a child that had not completed two years at death was to be buried under ground in an unsullied spot outside the village (other than the usual cemetery), the dead body being anointed with ghee and decked with flowers and sandal paste and that no burning nor offering of water nor the collection of bones was to be perfor med in this case.

and Yama allows the recital of the Yamasūktā (Rg. X. 14) and the verses in honour of the god Yama. Manu V. 70, however, states other optional provisions viz, that the offering of water may be done (and therefore the cremation also of the dead body) in the case of infants that have struck teeth or after nāmakarana. Therefore there is an option as to cre mating an infant of less than two years, viz. it may be buried or cremated after nāmakarana or after the appearance of teeth. In this case it is not necessary that all the sapinda relatives should follow the dead body. If a child is two years old or more at death and upanayana has not been per formed it must be cremated with ordinary fire and water must be offered silently. The same rule applies to a child whoge cūdā (tonsure ) had been performed before death as stated by Laugākṣi. 528d The Vaik. Sm. S. V.11 lays down that there is no burning with fire until the 5th year for a boy and the 7th year for a girl. After Upanayana the child was to be cremated according to the rites prescribed for an āhitāgni so far as they could be applied (i. e. there would be cremation without sacrificial implements and the mantra "asmāt tvam abhijātosi' was not to be recited). The Baud. 529 P. S. (II. 3,10-11) provides that there is no cremation for children dying before the performance of caula (tonsure) and there is no pitrmedha for those whose upanayana had not been performed at death or for unmarried girls. It also provides that infants that have struck no teeth are to be buried with syllable 'om' and those that have had teeth with the Vyahrtis. The Mit, on Yāj. III.2 summarises the rules as follows: Before Namakarana there was to be only burial and no offering of water and the like; after Nāmakarana up to the third year cremation and offering of water are optional with burial; from the third year up to upanayana there is cremation and also offering of water but silently (without mantras); if Cūdā ceremony was performed before the 3rd year and the child died then also the same rule applied. After Upanayana the deceased was to be cremated with ordinary fire but the procedure was to be the same as for an āhitāgni.

Disposal of an ascetic's corpse 

229 

A. yati (sannyasin) was and is even now buried. In a previous note (n. 528b ) a verse of Kratu is quoted that a brahmacārin and yati are to be cremated with uttapana fire. The explanation of the Suddhiprakasa (p. 166 ) is that the word yati here means an ascetic of the Kuticaka kind and quotes a 530 verse as to how the dead bodies of the yatis of four grades are to be disposed of. The 531 Baud. P. S. III,11 gives a brief description which is adopted with some variations by the Smrtyarthasāra (p. 98 ) that contains a description of the death rites of a parivrājaka. 532 One should go to the east or north of the village, he should dig a pit (lit. a sacrificial place) as deep as the staff ( carried by the yati) under a palāśa tree or on a river bank or on some other pure spot to the accompaniment of the vyāhrtis; then he should sprinkle water thereon thrice repeating the seven vyāhrtis each time, should spread darbha grass on the bottom of the pit, should deck the dead body (with garlands, sandal paste ), deposit the body in the pit with the mantra (Tai. S.L1.3.1) 'OVisnu! guard this offering (the dead body ).' He should place in the right hand the staff of the parivrājaka ( breaking it into three parts ) with the mantra 

Visnu took strides over this' (Rg. I.22.17, Vāj. S. V. 15, Tai. S. I.2.13.1). He places the sikya (loop of strings ) in the left

Br. 1.4.8.6), the pot on his belly with the Gāyatri stanza (Rg. III.62.10, Vāj. S. III. 35, Tai. S. 1.5.6.4), his water pot near his private parts with the mantra earth went to earth'. He then invokes with the mantras beginning with 'cittih sruk' (ten sentences in Tai. Ā., Maitrāyaṇi S. I 9. 1 which are called 'caturhotāraḥ”).533 The other rites are not performed here as they were performed before. No cremation should be done, no āśauca should be observed nor should water be offered to (an ascetic who is dead) who was free from all attachments and who had given himself up to meditation. The Smrtyarthasāra adds that no ekoddista śrāddha nor sapindikarana is performed for an ascetic, but only pārvana on the 11th day, that a kutīcaka should be cremated, the bahüdaka should be buried, haisa should be thrown into water and paramahamsa should be thoroughly buried. The Nirnayasindhu (pp. 634-635) quotes the Smrtyartha sāra and then adds a few details from Br̥hat-Saunaka, viz, that the dead body of a yati should be bathed with the Purusasūkta (Rg, X, 90), then the pit (dug for burial) should be sprinkled eight times with the syllable 'Om'on all sides; having deposited the body in the pit with the Yajus formula 'O Visnu! guard this offering' (Tai, S.1.1.3.1) and with 'Om', he should place in the right hand the staff with the mantra “Viṣnu took strides over this' (Rg. I. 22.17), then pierce the crown of the head with a conch by repeating the mantra 'bhūr-bhuvah-syah', he should fill up the pit with salt to the recitation of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90). He should fill up the pit thoroughly (with sand) in order to guard against jackals and dogs and the like (exhuming the body with their paws). The Dharmasindhu (p. 497) adds some details particularly as to the number of hymns and mantras to be repeated. It states that the crown of the head should be pierced with a conch or an axe, that one who is unable to do this should smash a ball of jaggery placed on the head. It adds that no yati except kuțicaka should be cremated. In modern times a sannyāsin is always buried and not cremated, since kuțicaka and bahūdaka kinds of yati are no longer in vogue and it is only the paramahamsa that is prevalent in the whole of India.

Why ascetics were not cremated 

appears to me to be as follows; part of the procedure of becoming an ascetic consisted in giving up his srauta fires and throwing in fire his sacrificial wooden implements (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 954). One of the rules for ascetics is that he should not kindle śrauta or smārta fires nor kindle ordinary fire for cooking his food but was to subsist on cooked food obtained by begging (H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 933-934). The householder was cremated with his srauta or smārta fire but the ascetic, having abjured these, was without any fire and was therefore buried. The Vaikhānasasmārtasutra X. 8 (ed. by Caland ) contains a brief description of the burial of an ascetic who was not an āhitāgni and the cremation of an ascetic who was āhitāgni.) 

Special rules were laid down about the cremation of women dying in or immediately after child-birth and women dying while still in their monthly illness. A smrti quoted by the Mit. and the Smrti-candrikā (I. p. 121) provides that in the case of a sütikā, one should take water and pañcagavya in a jar, should repeat holy texts (such as 'āpo hi sthā' Rg. X. 9. 1-9, verses addressed to Varuna) over them, should then bathe the sütikā with water and pañcagavya and then cremate the body. A woman in her monthly illness was to be similarly bathed and she was to be covered with another garment and then cremated. Vide Garudapurāņa II, 4. 171 ff and Nirnayasindhu p. 621. Similarly, elaborate rules are pres cribed about the rites of cremation in relation to the death of a pregnant woman (vide Baud. P. S. III, 9, Nirnayasindhu p. 622) which are passed over here. 

Dead bodies were disposed off in different ways at different times and in different countries. The various methods of dis posal were cremation, burial underground, water burial, expo sure of the body for being destroyed 534 by vultures and other birds (as among Zoroastrians) or beasts, being preserved in 

534. According to the Parsi scriptures burying a human corpse in the earth was a grave sin and if the body was not disinterred there was no atonement in the case of a professor of the law of Mazd or one who had studied it and if he did not disinter it within six months or within a year, he was liable to receive five hundred or a thousand stripes respectively. Vide Vendidad, Fargard III (S.B.E. Vol. 4 pp. 31-32). Carpses were to Be laid down on the summits of mountains to be devoured by birds and dogs and the exposure of corpses was the most striking practice of the Mazdean profession (S, B. E. Vol. IV part 1 Intro. p. XLV),

caves, 535 or being mummified (as in Egypt). The general rule in India from times of which we have literary evidence was cremation; though burial took place in certain exceptional cases such as in the case of infants, ascetics &c. How the ancient Indians hit upon this scientific though rather heart rending method of the disposal of dead bodies it is difficult to say 536 Burials were not unknown in India even in very early times, as Atharvaveda 5. 30. 14 (mā nu bhumigrho bhuvat) and 18. 2. 34 show. The last may be rendered as follows: O Agnil bring all those pitrs here in order that they may par take of the offering, those (pitrs whose bodies) were buried or cast aside (exposed) or burnt or deposited above (on trees or in caves ? )536a. In the word 'anagnidagdhāh' occurring in Rg. X. 15. 14, scholars see a reference to burial. But it is quite possible that no burial is referred to. If some ancestors were killed far from home in a fight or if they were kidnapped and killed by enemies, their bodies might have been left uncared for in a distant land and not cremated nor buried. A. passage in the Chāndogy a 537 Up. (VIII, 8. 5) is construed by some scholars as referring to burials. It may be rendered as follows: Therefore they designate even now a man, an asura who does not make gifts, who has no faith and who offers no sacrifices ; for this is the esoteric doctrine of Asuras. They deck out the body of the dead with bhikṣā (perfumes and flowers ?), with a Taiment by way of decoration, and think that they will thus conquer the next world. Though the passage is not quite clear, the reference to Asuras, their usage of decorating the dead body and thereby being able to gain the next world render it probable that the usage of the burial of the body among Asuras is referred to. In Rg. VII. 89.1 the sage prays O Varuna! 

535. In Rome the bones of over 4000 monks are preserved in the walls of the subterranean burial chapels in the Capuchin Church near the Piazza Barberini. For a description of the catacombs in Rome, vide Puckle's 

Funeral customs' p. 136 ( quoting from Frothingham). 

536. Vulliamy in 'Immortal man' (p. 34) throws out the suggestion that one of the purposes of cremation may have been the complete destruc tion of the human aspect of the ghost or its transference to a region from which contact with mankind in any material sense was impossible.

may I not go to the earthen house'. This is probably a re ference to burial. Besides, after the charred bones were collec ted, they were placed in an urn or pot, which was buried in the ground and after a good deal of time a mound (smaśāna) was built upon the bones as will be seen immediately from a passage in the Sat. Br, and other sources. In A, V. XVIII. 2. 25 it is said, 'may the tree not oppress them, nor the great goddess Earth'. This is probably a reference to a coffin and burial. 

It is somewhat curious that the progressive nations of the West, believing in a literal interpretation of the Biblical words (such as Matthew 22.23-33, Mark 12. 18-27 and Luke 20. 37-38, John 5. 19-31 and 6. 32-56) about physical resurrection of the dead, held fast by burial alone and up to the end of the 19th century people in Christendom would not allow the cremation of a dead body. The case of Reg. v. Price illustrates how deep the sentiment against cremation was and how popular fury prevented Price from disposing of the body of his dead child of five months by petroleum fire in a field, how he was prosecuted for two offences viz, misdemeanor at Common Law for burning a dead body instead of burying it and misdemeanor on the ground that he attempted to burn the body with intent to prevent an inquest being held on it by the coroner.538 It was only in 1902 that the Cremation Act (2 Edw.7 Ch. 8) was passed empowering burial authorities to establish crematoria on plans approved by the Minister of Health. The Catholic Church does not even now allow cremation. The ancient Romans on the other hand held cremation as the honourable means of the disposal of the dead body but reserved burial for the suicide and the murderer. 

Embalming the dead for some time at least was not quite unknown in India. The Sat. Sr. 29. 4. 29 and Vaik. Sr. 31.23 539 prescribe that if an āhitāgni died away from his people his corpse should be laid down in a tub or trough filled with sesame oil and brought home in a cart. In the Rāmāyana it is several times said that the body of Dasaratha was placed for several

What the state of things was before the composition of the Rgveda cannot be said with certainty. There is no general agreement as to the age of the Rgveda and of the ruins found at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. Sir John Marshall (in Mohenjo daro vol. I. p. 86) refers to complete burials, partial burials and post cremation burials. The excavations at Lauriya 541 Nandan garh have brought to light supposed Vedic burial mounds in which has been found a small repousse golden plaque bearing the figure of a nude female, the Earth Goddess. These and the disposal of corpses in paleolithic ages are matters for archaeo logists and are outside the proper scope of the present work. 

The Hâralata (p. 126 ) quotes a passage from the Adipurana to the effect that Magas (Magians ) are buried underground and that Daradas and Luptrakas (?) go away after placing their dead relatives on trees. 541c 

It appears that among early Buddhists in India hardly any religious ceremony was performed, whether the person deceased was a layman or even a member of the Order. In the Mahaparinibbāna Suttanta the death and the funeral ceremonies of the great founder of Buddhism are described in chapter VI (Section 14 ff). All that is gathered from that chapter is that the favourite disciple of the Buddha, Ananda, uttered a stanza, some of the disciples that were not free from passion wept and fell headlong on the ground, while others (who were Arabats ) bore the grief with composure, that next morning Ananda went to the Mallas of Kusinārā, that the Mallas took perfumes,

garlands, all musical instruments and five hundred suits of apparel, the Mallas passed seven days in paying homage to the body of the Buddha that lay in the śāla grove with dancing, hymns, music, garlands and perfumes, in making canopies of their garments, that on the 7th day they carried the body of the Blessed One to the south but owing to a miracle (described in sections 29-32) they carried it through the city by the north gate and laid the body to the east (the general rule was that a dead body was not to be carried through the middle of a village, and was to be carried to the south but as Buddha was so extraordinary and holy the above was allowed to be done). The body of the Buddha was then wrapped in a new cloth, then with cotton wool, then in a new cloth and so on till 500 layers of cloth and cotton wool covered the body. The body was then placed in an oil vessel of iron which was covered with another oil vessel of iron. Then a funeral pile of all kinds of perfumes was built upon which the body was placed. Then Mahākassapa and five hundred brethren accompanying him arranged their robes on one shoulder (representing the way in which the sacred thread is arranged among the brahmanas), bowed down with clasped hands, went round the body reverently thrice. The body was then burnt and only bones remained. Then the narrative states that Ajātasatru, king of Magadha, the Licchavis of Vesāli and several others claimed portions of the relics of the Buddha. Then the relics were divided into eight parts. Those who received them built mounds (Thüpas) over the relics and the Moriyas who got only embers also built a Thūpa over them and a brāhmaṇa Dona (Droņa) built a mound over the jar (kumbha) in which the bones were collected. Mr. Rhys Davids remarks (S. B. E. vol. XI Introduction p. XLV) 'though funerals are naturally not infrequently mentioned in the historical books and in the Birth stories there is nowhere any reference to a recognised mode of performing any religious worship'. It will be noticed that the Buddhist ritual 542, though simple, agrees closely with some of the rules of Āśv. gr.

After the relatives (sons and the like) of a deceased person have offered water, have taken a bath and after they emerge from the water (of a river or the like) and are sitting on a plot of soft green grass, elderly persons should talk to them (in order to lessen their grief) about ancient narratives (Yāj. III, 7 and G. P. S. I. 4.2 543). Visnu Dh, S. 20. 22-53 contain a long disquisition on the grip that Kāla (Time, Death) has on every body including even Indra, gods, daityas, great kings and sages, how everyone that is born is sure to die (i. e. Death is inevi table), and how no one (except the wife) can follow the depar ted on his journey to the other world, how the good actions and bad actions will accompany the spirit of the dead, how śrāddha confers great benefit on the departed; it winds up that therefore the surviving relatives should offer śrāddha and give up lamen tations that help no one, that it is dharma that alone follows the soul through his wanderings 544. Yāj. III. 8-11 (=Garudapurāṇa II. 4. 81-84) are verses in a similar strain and are intended to serve the same purpose. They are: 'He, who seeks everlasting ness in this human life that is as devoid of strength as the stock of a plantain plant, and that is as inconstant as a bubble of water, is a deluded person. What is the use of lamentation if the body, created out of the five elements by reason of actions performed in a former life, returns to those five elements? The earth, the ocean and the gods

Fleet further refers to the tradition that the great emperor Asoka dug up seven out of the eight mounds of the relics of Buddha and transferred almost all their contents to 84000 boxes of gold and silver and distributed them throughout India and built monuments (stūpas) over them. Rhys Davids in 'Buddhist India' (pp. 78-80). after stating that deceased per sons of distinction either by birth or wealth or official status or as public teachers were cremated and the ashes were buried under a tope (Pali thūpa'). remarks The dead bodies of ordinary people were disposed of in a unique way. They were put away in a public place. There as a rule the bodies or the remains of the pyre were not buried but left to be destroyed by birds or beasts or dissipated by the process of natural decay'.

are destined to go to destruction (at some future date when pralaya takes place). How is it possible that the world of mortals which is (evanescent) like foam will not meet with destruction? As the departed spirit, being helpless, has to swallow the tears and phlegm cast by kinsmen, they should not weep but should perform (obsequial) rites according to their ability.' Gobhilasmrti III. 39 urges 'do not lament for what is perishable and what is the characteristic (destiny) of all beings. Exert yourselves in the performance of meritorious acts wbich will accompany you.' Gobhila then quotes Yaj. III. 8-10 and ono verse from the Mahābhārata 54la viz. 'All collections are to end in dissipation, all rise is to end in fall, all unions in separa tion and life in death'. Aparārka quotes the Rāmāyana and Vāsudeva's words from the Salyaparva to Dhrtarāstra on the death of Duryodhana. The Par. M. I. 2 pp. 292-93, the Suddhi prakāśa pp. 205-206 and several other works quote the verses of Viṣnu, Yāj, and Gobhila. 

The Garudapurāṇa here (II. 4.91-100) waxes eloquent over the immolation of a wife on her husband's funeral pyre, over the miraculous power of a pativrată, and states that a brāhmana woman should not burn herself apart from her husband's body (or after he is cremated), but that ksatriya and other women may do so, that the practice of sati is common to all women even including chāndala women, but pregnant women or those that have young children should not do so and that a woman does not become free from the liability to be born again and again as a woman until she becomes a Sati. 

After listening to the philosophical discourse of elders the relatives return to their house, placing children in front and standing at the door of the house, they with minds under control bite the leaves of the nimba tree, perform ācamana, touch fire, water, cowdung, white mustard; then they should enter their house after slowly (firmly) planting their foot on a stone.

( 4.14-15 ) lays down that the relatives who returned from the cemetery should sit down for three days on mats and fast, that if they are unable ( to fast for three days ) they should subsist on food bought in the market or obtained unasked. Yāj. III. 17 and Pār. III, 10 549 provide that for the night they should put milk and water in an earthen vessel in the open space (on a 

ilya) with the words 'O departed one! bathe hero ( in the water) and drink this milk'. Yāj. III. 17, Paighinasi, Manu V. 84, Par. gr. III. 10, and others state that the relatives of the departed should perform their own daily rites to be performed in the frauta fires (such as Agnihotra and Darsapürnamāsa ) and in the smārta fire (such as morning and evening homa) on account of the peremptory dictates of the Veda (such as one should perform Agnihotra as long as one lives'). The commentators have added several limitations and restri otions. The Mit.550 on Yāj. III, 17 states that, as Manu V. 84 only prohibits the stopping of the rites in (Vedic and Smārta) fires, such religious duties as the five daily Mahāyaiñas are excluded, that Vaišvadeva, though perforined in fire, is excluded because there is an express text of Samvarta a brahmana should be without Vaišvadava for ten days ( after the death of a sapinda), that the Srauta and Smārta rites should be got per formed by another, as Paraskara (III. 10'anya etāni kuryuh) expressly lays down. Only nitya and naimitti ka acts to be performed in Vedic and Smārta fires are allowed and so kāmya rites cannot be performed. Even at present Agnihotring

perform their srauta nitya homa during days of impurity them selves, though some get it performed by another. (Vide Yāj. III. 17, Manu V. 84). Although there is a text of Gobhilasmrti (III, 60 ) prohibiting the performance of sandhyā, yet relying on a sütra of Paithinasi the Mit. says that a man can offer water to the Sun in worship; others like the Smrtimuktāphala (p. 478) say that sandhyā mantras may be revolved in the mind, except the prānāyāma mantras. This is followed in modern times in many parts of India. Visnu Dh. S. 22,6 prescribes that in impurity due to birth or death homa (Vaišvadeva ), giving and accepting gifts and the study of Veda cease. The Vaik. Sm. S. VI.4 states that the perform ance of sandhyā adoration, all rites for the gods and manes, gift and acceptance and Veda study should be given up during impurity on death. Gautama 14.44 appears to hold that a brāhmana is not affected by impurity on birth and death for the purposes of Veda study. On the other hand Samvarta 551 (43) affirms that on the days of impurity on birth and death there is no performance of the five Mahāyajñas nor of Veda study The Nityācāra-paddhati p. 544 states that even in aśauca the thousand names of Visnu may be recited. 

Asthisañcayana or Sancayana means that rite in which the (charred) bones (of the cremated person) are collected. This rite is dealt with in many sutra and smrti works, such as Sān. Sr. IV. 15. 12-18, Sat. Śr. 28. 3, Āśv.gr. 1V. 5.1-18, Gaut. P. S. I. 5, Visnu Dh. S. 19. 10-12, Baud. P. S. I. 14, Kausika-sutra 82. 29-32, Vaik. Smārta Sūtra V. 7, Yama 87-88, Samvarta 38, Gobhila-smrti III, 54-59 (q. by Haralata p. 183). There is great divergence of viows about the day on which this was to be done. For example, Sat. Sr. 28. 3.1 provides: 552 'bones are collected. on the next day (after cremation) or on the 3rd, 5th or 7th.' Samvarta (verse 38) and Garudapurāņa (Pretakhanda 5. 15) prescribe that collection of bones should be made on the 1st, 3rd. 7th or 9th and (particularly) on the 4th by twice-born persons. The Vámanapurāņa (14. 97-98) allows it on the 1st, 4th or 7th day. Yama (87) requires the relatives to collect bones from the 1st to the 4th day after cremation and also provides (verse 88)

that the four varnas should respectively perform sancayuna on the 4th, 5th, 7th and 9th day. The Āśv. gr. S. IV. 5. 1 states that sancajana should be performed after the 10th day from cremation in the dark half, but on uneven tithis (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 11th. 13th, 15th) and on a nakṣafra which bears a name not applicable to two or more nakṣatras (i. e, except on the two Asadhas, two Phalgunis and two Bhadrapadās). Visnu Dh, S. 19 10. Vaik. Smārta-sūtra V. 7, Kaus. 82. 29, Visnupurāṇa TIL 13 14. Kūrmapurana (uttara) 23 and a few other works lay down that sañicayana must be done on the 4th day after cremation. The various texts differ a good deal in details. The following is the procedure in the Ašv. gr. IV.5:--The bones of a male should be collected into an urn that has no special marks (protuberances), those of a woman in an urn that has protuberances but no other special marks. Aged persons, odd in number 553 not being together with women, (i.e. not as a mixed assemblage ) collect the bones. The per foriner walks thrice round the spot (where the body was burnt) with his left side turned towards the spot, sprinkles on it with a sami branch milk mixed with water with a verse *sitike' ( Rg. X. 16. 14). With the thumb and the 4th finger they (gatherers ) should put each single bone into the urn without making a rattling noise (of the bones in the urn), the bones of the féet being taken first, those of the head last. Having well gathered the bones and having purified them with a win nowing basket (i. e, removing the dust attaching to them) they should put the urn in a pit at a place where the waters from different sides do not flow together except rain water with the verse 'upasarpa' (Rg. X. 18. 10) and he should throw earth (into the pit) with the following verse (Rg. X. 18. 11). After having thrown (earth) he should repeat the next verse (Rg. X. 18. 12). Then covering (the mouth of the urn) with a lid with the mantra ut te stabh nami' (Rg. X. 18. 13) (he fills up the pit). Then without looking back they return (towards the house), bathe in water and then offer sraddha to him alone (the departed). Dr. B. N.

pp. 223-307 regards (p. 285) Rg. X. 18 as a hymn dealing with burial of the whole body (and not of ashes), while he admits (p. 287) that Rg. X. 16 is a cremation hymn. I dissent from him for various reasons; the most important is that if his theory be correct a period of several centuries must be postulated between the two hymns. This is inadmissible. 

The Kausikasutra (82. 29-32) prescribes certain details differently. It says that the bones are collected with A. V. 18. 2. 24, 26, then they are consigned to a jar over which all frag Tant powders are scattered, then the jar is raised with the Utthāpanī verses and carried with the verses called Harinis (i. e. A. V. 18. 2. 11-18). He (the performer) deposits in the earth the urn) at the root of a tree with the verse 'mā tvā' (A. V. 18. 2. 25 May the tree not injure thee all round, may not the wide goddess Earth also injure thee'). 554 

The other sūtras present several variations which are passed over here, excepting one or two matters. The Sat. Sr. provides that the twig should be of the Udumbara tree, that the bones are collected by women of the family of the deceased (his wife and others) odd in number (five or more), or other women (in the absence of women of the family). A woman who is not likely to have a child should tie in her left hand a Br̥hati fruit with two threads, blue and red in colour, should step on a stone with her left foot, collect the bones first from the teeth or head with the mantra "uttiṣthata' (Tai. Ā. VI. 4. 2) and she should deposit those bones in a jar or garment, then a second woman of the same type collects bones from the shoulders or arms, a third woman from the sides or hips, a fourth from the thighs or legs, and a fifth from the feet. They or more women collect the bones completely. The urn is deposited at the root of a sami or palāśa tree. 

In modern times, particularly in towns and cities, the collection of bones has to be done immediately after cremation. The Antyesti-paddhati closely follows the procedure prescribed in the Āśv. gr. quoted above. It says: the performer goes to the place of cremation, sips water, mentions the time and place, makes a sankalpa (declaration) that he will perform the collec

tion of the bones of the departed naming him and his gotra, Ho walks thrice round the place of cremation with his left towards it and sweeps it with a sami branch and sprinkles it with milk mixed with water with the mantra 'śītike' (Rg. X. 16. 14). Then old men odd in number with the performer collect the bones (as stated by Asv. gr. above) and place them in a new jar and if they are of a woman in a jar with protu berances. They also winnow the ashes with a sūrpa and place in the jar even small bones and throw the ashes into the Ganges. Then at some time other than the rainy season a pit should be dug in a pure spot whereon water would not flow and the performer deposits the jar in the pit with the mantra approach this mother, Earth' (Rg. X. 18. 10). With Rg. X. 18. 11. he throws earth in the pit all round the jar and murmurs with folded hands the mantra (Rg. X. 18. 12) and he closes the jar with a new earthen disk with the verse Rg. X. 18. 13. Then he should put earth on the jar in such a way that it may not be geen by anybody and without looking back should go else where and bathe. The Nirnayasindhu (p. 586) expressly states that the procedure for the collection of bones may be gathered from one's sütra or from the work of Bhatta (i. e. Nārāyana, Kamalakara's grandfather). 

The Visnudharmasutra (19.11-12) and Anu. 26.32 state that the collected bones should be cast in Ganges water, since as many particles of the bones of a man remain in Ganges water for go many thousands of years he dwells in heaven. It was provided in the Puranas that a virtuous son, brother or daughter's son or a 

lative on the father's or mother's side should cast the bones in the Cangas, that one not so related should not do it and that if he does it he has to perform cândrāyaṇa prāyaścitta. Even in modern times many Hindus take the charred bones of their parents or other dear relatives to the Ganges at Prayāga Allahabad) or some other holy river 34a or cast them into the 

The Nirnayasindhu (p. 587 ) quotes an elaborate rite of casting the ashes in the Ganges from Saunaka. It is briefly as follows: The performer should go out of the village, bathe with

pañcagavya. With the four mantras ‘upasarpa' (Rg. X. 18.10-13) he should respectively pray to the earth, then dig it, take out the earth, and then the bones. Then he should bathe and purify the bones by touching the bones again and again and repeating the mantras 'eto nvindram stavāma suddham &c.' (Rg. VIII. 95. 7-9). Then he should bathe with pañca gavya and become pure. Then he should bathe ten times with cow's urine, cow's dung, cow's milk, curds, clarified butter, water in which kusas have been dipped, ashes (of sacred fires ), earth, honey and water. Then he should sprinkle (with kusas) water on the bones with the mantras, viz. Rg. 1.22.16. Rg. VIII. 95,7-9,555 Rg. VII, 56,12-14, Rg. X. 126,1-8, Rg. X. 119.1-13, Rg. IX. 11-10 (called Pāvamāni Verses ), Rg. X. 128.1-9, Rg. I. 43.1-9 (a hymn to Rudra ); then he should offer a hiranya érāddha for the deceased, offer pinda to him and perform tar pa na with sesame. Then he should cover the bones in seven ways viz. by deer-skin, woollen blanket, darbhas, cow's hair, hempen cloth, birch leaf and palm leaf. He should cast among the bones pieces of gold and silver, pearls, coral and sapphire for the purification of the bones, then he should offer into fire 108 oblations of clarified butter and sesalne with the hymn beginn ing with 'udiratām' (Rg. X. 15). Then he should cast the bones in holy water; thereby he does not incur the fault of touching an unclean object. While answering the calls of nature or performing ācamana one should not hold the bones, 

The Nirnayasindhu adds (p. 588) that there is no asthi. sañcayana for one whose upanayana had not been performed. 

The Aśv. gr. 1V.6, the Sat. Sr. 28.4, Sān. Sr. 4.6 (called paridhikarma) and some others prescribe a śānti rite after collection of the charred bones of a deceased person. The Baud. P. S. (II. 3.3) and Vispu Dh, S. 19.19 appear to prescribe the Santi rite after the ten days of impurity have expired ('dasarātre saucam krtvā sāntih'). It is described by Aśy, gr, as follows: They who have lost a guru (father or mother) by death should perform on the new moon day an expiatory ceremony. Before sunrise they should carry fire together with its ashes and with its receptacle to the south with the half verse 'I send away the flesh-devouring Agni' (Rg. X. 16. 9). Having cast that fire down at a place where four roads meet or somewhere else, they

They should then re turn home without looking back, bathe in water, have their hair, beards and hair on the body and nails cut, furnish themselves. with new jars, pots, vessels for rinsing the mouth, with garlands of sami flowers, with fuel of sami wood, with two pieces of sami wood for kindling fire 556 and with branches for encircling the fire, with bull's dung and hide, fresh butter, a stone and as many bunches of kusa grass as there are young women in the house). At the time of the Agnihotra (in the afternoon) he should kindle fire (by means of the aranis) with the half verse 'Here may this other Jātavedas' (Rg. X. 16.9 latter half)'. Keeping the fire burn ing they sit till night silence falls, repeating tales of old men (of the family) and stories of auspicious contents, Itihūsas and Purūnas. When all sounds have ceased or when the others (members of the deceased's family) have gone to their houses or resting place, the performer) should pour out a continuous stream of water beginning at the south side of the door with the verse (Rg. X, 53.6) 'spreading the thread follow the light of the world' and go round the house ending at the north side of the door, Then having placed the fire and spread to the west of it a bull's hide with neck to the east, with the hair outside, he should cause the people of the house (including women) to step on that hide with the verse' Arise to long life' 557 (Rg. X, 18.6). He should place twigs round the fire with Here do I deposit an encircling thing' (Rg. X. 18.4). Having placed a stone to the north of the fire with the words 'May they place a mountain between themselves and death' (Rg. X. 18.4 last pāda) and having sacrificed with four verses 'Go hence, O Death' (Rg. X. 18.1-4), he should look at his people with the verse 'as days follow each other' (Rg. X. 18.5).

away the blades turning their faces away. The performer should look at them while they are salving their eyes, with the verse these women, being no widows and having good husbands' (Rg. X. 18.7). The former should first touch the stone with 'the stream containing stones flows' ( Rg. X. 53.8). After that, stationing himself to the north-east, while others go round with the fire, bull-dung and a continuous stream of water he should, after repeating the three verses (āpo hi sthā, Rg. X. 9.1-3), murmur the verse these have led round the cows' (Rg. X. 155,5). A tawny-coloured bull should be led round. They then sit down at a place where they like to stop, having put on fresh unwashed garments and they sit there till sunrise avoid ing sleep. After sunrise, having murmurred the hymns sacred to the sun and auspicious hymns, having prepared food and made oblations with the hymn beginning ‘May he burn away evil from us' (Rg. I. 97.1-8), verse by verse, having given to the brāhmanas to eat, he should cause them to pronounce auspicious words. A cow, a cup of metal and a fresh unworn garment are the sacrificial fee for each of the brāhmanas.. . 

A few details may be added from other sutras. The Sat. Śr. (28.4.1) provides that the Sānti is performed on the 10th day after cremation by a priest, that in the folded hands of the wives of the members of the family ) he puts the remains of the material used for oblations with the verse 'these women, not being widows' (Rg. X. 18.7=Tai. A. VI. 10.2), that the priest plants in the earth the stalk of a plant with the verse 'yathā tvam' (Tai, Ā. VI. 10.2 ) 558, that after they return home, they cook goat flesh and boil yava grains and eat them and then may occupy couches and cots (i. e, give up the observances of mourning).

the grave 560 or monument should not be built too soon after death, lest he (the performer) freshen up the sin of the deceased ; that he should make it a long time after and when people do not even remember the years (that have elapsed since the decease).

He should make it just a man's size, broader behind (to the west) and broader on the north side. He encloses it with cords twisted in the non-sunwise way. He then bids them to cut out the earth which would be just sufficient for making the mound of a man's size. 

The Kāt. Sr. (21.3.1 and 6) closely follows the above direc tions contained in the Sat. 561 Br. The Sat. Sr. 29. 1.2 provides that when the day of cremation is not known or remembered one may erect a mound over the bones ( with clods of earth or bricks) on the New Moon day that comes immediately after the Full Moon day of Māgha, Phālguna, Caitra, Vaisakha or of the summer months (Jyestha and Āsādha), 

The Sat. Br. (XIII. 8.2-4) pursues the subject of sepulchral monuments as follows: Godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate from the earth; while those who are of the Asura stamp, the Easterns and others, make the sepulchral mounds so as to be separate from the earth, either on a stone basin or a similar thing. He then encloses it with an undefined number of stones silently. He then sweeps the sepul chral site with a palāśa branch with (Vāj. S. 35.1 'May the niggardly god-haters go away') and prays that Yama may grant him (the deceased) an abode. He throws out the branch to the south side. He then yokes the team of six oxen to the plough on the south side or on the north side, as he chooses, Having given the order 'Yoke 'he (the performer ) utters the stru,

mantra (Vaj. S. 35, 2 ) 562 Having turned round the plough from right ( south side ) to the north, he ploughs the first furrow with Vāj. S. 35.3 ' May Vāyu purify' along the north side towards the west; with 'May Savitr purify' along the west side towards the south ; with 'Agni's lustre' along the south side towards the east: with Sürya's brilliance' along the front side towards the north. Four furrows he ploughs with a Yajus formula. He then ploughs across the body (of the sepulchral site ) silently with an undefined number of furrows. He then unfastens the team of oxen, To the right side (south-west ) he removes this (the plough and the team). 

He then sows seeds of all kinds of herbs with a single verse (Vāj. S. 35.4); for long life he thereby prays for these (the performer's family ) and accordingly each subsequent one of them dies of old age. He then pours out that (jar of bones ). He does so before sunrise so that the sun should rise over him while he is doing it. He does so with Vāj. S. 35, 5-6. He then says to some one 'Proceed in that ( southern ) direction without drawing breath and having thrown down the jar, return hither without looking behind.' He then mutters Vāj. S. 35.7. He then arranges the dead man ( the bones ) limb by limb with Vāj. S. 35.8-9. Now thirteen unmarked 563 bricks each measuring a (human) foot (pada) have been made and are laid down 

562. It is not possible, owing to considerations of space, to set out all the verses of the Vaj. S. chap. 35 mentioned as mantras by the Sat. Br. Only a few are set out here in order to show how appropriate they are as referring to the actions prescribed by the Sat. Br.

563. The bricks of the fire altar are marked with lines (vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. p. 1248). The bricks in Agnicayana are as long as the foot of the sacrificer. Thereon gods have to be worshipped. Here it is the fathers to be honoured. Throughout Sat. Br. XIII. 8.2-3 a distinction is drawn between what is done for the gods and what is to be done for pitrs in order to keep the divine distinct from what belongs to the fathers. In Agnicayana a bird-like pattern is the most frequent (vide H. of Dh vol. II. p. 1249 1 is hence that the Sat. Br. speaks of wings and tails. The heights preseti bodoh for men of the several varnas and for women are symbolic. Kṣaltyas brahmanas and vaisyas represent the arms, the mouth and thighs of the Purusa (as stated in Rg. X. 90.12). The Kat, Sr. (21.4 13-14) gives an option in the case of a ksatriya viz. the mound may be as high as theher Hoekar Oriental or as high as a man with upstretched arms.

silently (and not with mantras as in the case of the Agnicayana ). One of the thirteen he places in the middle, with the front towards the east (this represents the trunk); three are placed in front (representing the head); three on the right (that is the right wing ); three on the left (that represents the left wing); three behind (representing the tail). He then directs them to bring some soil from a cleft in the ground. Some dig in the intermediate (south-eastern ) quarter and fetch it from there; others dig in the south-west and fetch it north wards; he may do as he likes (there is an option). Let him not make the sepulchral mound too large. For a kṣatriya he may make it as high as a man with upstretched arms, for a brāhmana reaching up to the mouth, for a woman up to the hipg, for a vaiśya up to the thighs, for a sūdra up to the knee; or let him rather make it so high (for all ) as to reach below the knee. While the mound is being made, they hold a bundle of reed grass to the north of it. Let him not throw it down after hold ing it up or after bringing it, but let him set it up in the house (as it represents offspring). Having prepared it he sows barley grain, thinking 'May they ward off (yavaya ) sin from me!' He covers it over with Avakā plants in order that there may be moisture ( ka or joy ) for him and with darbha grass for goftness. 

They fix pegs round it, a palāśa one in front, a sami one on the north corner, a varana one behind and a vộtra 564 peg on the right (south corner). On the south side they dig two some. what curved furrows and fill them with milk and water and they dig seven on the left (north) side and fill them with water for sin not to pass beyond. They throw three stones each into the northern furrows and pass over them with Vaj. S. 35. 10 ( = Rg. X. 53. 8). They cleanse themselves with Apāmārga 565 plants with Vāj. S. 35.11; they thereby wipe away sin. They bathe at any place where there is water. With Vāj.

home. They proceed towards the village muttering Vaj. S. 35.14 (ud vayam). When they have arrived, ointments for their eyes and feet are given to them; such indeed are human means of embellishment and therewith they keep off death from them selves. Then in the house having kindled (domestic) fire and laid enclosing sticks of rarana wood round it he offers by means of a sruva (spoon) an oblation to Agni Ayuṣmat. Vāj. S. 35. 16 serves 567 as a puronuvākyā (invitatory formula). He then offers with Vāj. S. 35.17. He says this so that Agni may guard and protect these men. The sacrificial fee is an old ox, old barley, old chair with a head cushion. He may give more if he desires. This is the procedure in the case of one who has performed Agnicayana. 568 In the case of him who has not performed Agni cayana, there is the same procedure for selecting a site and the same performance save that of the fire-altar. Having fetched a clod from the boundary he deposits it midway between the sepulchral mound and the village with Vāj. S. 35. 15 (imam 569 jivebhyah). He then makes this a boundary between the Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle the two. 

The Sat. Sr. 29.1 3 ff. and Baud. P. S. I 17-20 provide a lengthy procedure for erecting a mound over the bones of one who has performed the special rite of agnicayana which is passed over here. In building a mound the urn deposited under a tree is taken out and after the bones are purified in various ways (such as the spilling on them of curds mixed with vājina from a jar, the digging up of the clods by means of a plough to which a certain number of oxen are yoked). The Sat. Śr. (29.1. 3-12) deals with one kind of procedure in which there is no dhowana, while 29.1. 13-32 deal with the procedure where dhavana is employed and sūtras from 33 deal with procedure common to both paksas (viz.one without dhavana and the other with dhavana) The building of a mound with clods (loṣtaciti) in which there is dhavana is rather an obscure matter in its nature and had some gymbolic significance which is now lost. It may be briefly described as follows:- The members of the deceased's house

build a shed or a seat for a bed. They drive in the eastern half or middle or western half of it a three-pronged palasa peg. In front of it one born of a südra woman or a brahmabandhu (a brāhmana only in name ) sits down for a dialogue. He asks the principal wife ( of the deceased) 'will you dwell with me. That woman replies to him 'I shall not give (what you ask).' The same dialogue takes place on the 2nd day. Then on the third day she replies 'I shall give for one night.' Or if this peculiar practice (of talking about dhavana, which literally means 'sexual intercourse') was intended to last for more days than three she was to give a suitable reply (viz, for three nights or for five nights &c). When the words of the reply are uttered by the wife, the performer deposits the bones ( of the deceased) at the root of the peg and places between the three prongs of the peg a jar having a hundred holes at the bottom. The mouth of the 

covered with a hide and kusa grass. On that jar he sprinkles curds mixed with vājina with the mantra Vaišvānare haviridam' (Tai. Ā. VI, 6.1). When the liquid oozes from the jar on the bones he invokes the two verses 'drapsas-caskanda' and 'imam samudram' (Tai. Ā. VI. 6). Then the Sat Śr. (29.1. 26-29) provides that four brahmacārins or other brāhmanas, that are pure, tie up their locks on their heads that are to the right and keep dishevelled those on the left side of the head, they strike their right thighs and also the hide that is wound round the jar of bones, fan it with the fringes of their garments, go round the peg thrice with their left side towards the jar and the people living in the same house (with the deceased) and women also do the same, 570 that lutes (vinā) are played upon and also conches are blown and other instruments like nālika, tūņa, panava are beaten and there is also dancing, singing and playing on musical instruments. This practice of dhavana (symbolic ) may go on for five, seven, nine, eleven days, half a month, a month or a year during which time one has to donate food and money (gold &c.) according to one's ability or on the last day according to some. 571 If one may offer a conjecture. this rite was intended to assure the deceased man (represented by the charred bones) that his wife had remained faithful and

unattached to any one else even long after his death. The Baud. P. S. (IL 17.8) also states that female dancers dance in this rite. Various measurements are given in the sūtras for the mounds that are constructed over the bones. Sat, Sr. (29.1,5-6) says 572 that the site of the mound / śmaśānāyatana ) is five prakramas on all four sides (or six on the east and five in the other directions, acc. to some ). The height of the mound is variously given even in the same sūtra. 573 Sat. Sr. states that the height may be two finger-breadths, or three or four or a prūdeśa (the distance between the thumb and index finger when both are stretched away) or a vitasti (twelve finger-breadths), or it may be up to the knee or thighs or buttocks. The Baud. P.S.T. 18 gives different 574 measurements. It states if the mound to be raised is as high as the neck towards the west, then it is up to the navel on the east; if it is as high as the navel on the west, then it is as high as the knee on the east; if up to the knee on the west then on the east it is level with the ankle'. The Kausikasütra 575 (85.4-10) gives certain options viz, the mandapa on which the mound is to be erected is either 7, 7,5, 3 prakramas on the south, north, east and west or 9, 9, 7,5 on the same sides in order or 11, 11, 9, 7; that in the case of those who worshipped the gods, the length was eleven on all sides; that in the case of the Saunakins the sides (of the mound) are to be measured in odd numbers (of prakramas ) and the mounds are either round or four-cornered; that such mounds are seen (in those days) and that the grave built for one who had set up vedic fires was to be of the height of a man with arms upraised, These passages show that the graves were generally

quadrangular but sometimes round also (acc. to certain schools). The mounds at Lauriya referred to above are round. 

Another feature to be noted is that clods were employed (and so the mound was called lostaciti) or baked bricks in building the mound or grave over the bones by piling up layers of clay or bricks. In laying down the bricks first on the east, then on the north, then on the west and then on the south, the gütras such as Sat, Sr. ( 29.1.53 ,576 Baud, P.S. (I 19.4-7) four verses were respectively employed that are (in order) Rg. X. 18.13, 10, 11, 12 (which are also A. V. XVIII. 3.52, 49 50, 51 and Tai. A. VL71). One of these (Rg. X. 18.12 ) speaks of pillars and the other (Rg. X. 18.13) of a post (sthüņā). Vide above p. 189. The discovery of two wooden posts in two mounds ( at Lauriya above) in which the bones were deposited indicates that the Lauriya mounds followed a vedic custom which is mentioned by the srautasütras. The main difference between the Vedio and sutra ritual on the one hand and the Lauriya mounds on the other is the height of the latter, which betokens a later age than that of the sütras, 

The Sat. Sr, describes in the 28th praśna what is called pitrmedha while in praśna 29 it describes the brahmamedha, The difference between the two is pointed out in Sat. Śr. 29.3.4-18 and it is stated 577 (in Sat. Sr. 29.3. 20, 22 ) that the mantras called 'catur-hotārāh' are spoken of as brahma (in Tai. Br. III. 12.5) and that the procedure of Brahmamedha is to be employed only for an ācārya or a srotriya and for no one else. The Vaijayanti by Mahādeva states (in the Introduc tory verses) that praśnas 28 and 29 of Sat. Sr. are taken from Bharadvāja. It may be stated here that the procedure of dhavana described above in Sat. Sr, is no longer followed in India in

Stages in the disposal of dead bodies

modern times. In the Baud. 578 P. S. I 17 there are passages that bear a close resemblance to some passages of the Sat. Sr. on dhavana. Similarly, Kāt. Sr. 579 21. 3.6 provides (immedi ately after the months in which mounds were to be constructed) that as many jars should be taken as there are persons perform ing dhavana (or dhuvana) and the commentator explains that word as meaning 'fanning! 

It will be soon that the disposal of the dead in ancient India was divided into four stages viz. cremation, collecting the charred bones and depositing them underground in an urn, expiatory rites (called Sāntikarma) and erection of a monument over the bones. The last was not necessarily done in every case. The Andhau Inscription of the time of Rudradaman in the year 52 (probably of the saka era ) refers to the erection of a staff (lasti i.e. yasti) as a funeral monument to the memory of a sister, brother and wife by Madana son of Sihila (vide E. I. Vol. 16 pp. 23-25). In a long passage of the Brahma purāņa quoted by Aparārka (pp. 885-886) it is stated that the charred bones of a cremated person should be collected in an urn and deposited at the root of a tree or cast in the Ganges, that the place of cremation should be purified with cowdung and water, that a puskaraka tree should be planted there or an eduka (a structure ) should be built over it. 580 

The Sat śr. 28.4. 28 and Baud. P.S. II. 3. 2 state as shown above that the rites immediately after death were performed only up to the depositing of the urn (containing the bones) underground in the case of those householders who had not set up the vedic fires and in the case of married women and that in the case of him who had performed the solemn rite of Agni cayana a mound with bricks or clods was built up on the bones.

It is remarkable that while slaves and even attendants were often buried with the master in Babylon and Celtic Britain, there is no similar reference to the burial or cremation of anybody with the deceased even in the ancient procedure found in the Sat. Br. It is ouly possible to say that in some cases in the pre-Vedic age the wife might have burnt herself along with the deceased husband on the funeral pyre. There is no doubt that later works like the Visnudharmasütra recommended to women the practice of Sati as an option to leading the life of perfect celibacy after the husband's death, 

The persons entitled to perform the funeral rites after death (antyakarmādhikūrin) are the same as those entitled to offer sraddha. There is a good deal of difference as to the order of the persons so entitled. For example, Gautama (Dh.S. 15. 13-14) states 'On failure of sons the sapindas (e. g. brother, brother's son), the sapindas of the mother (e. g maternal uncle or his son) and pupils may perform śrāddha for the deceased; in default of these the family priest and the ācārya (veda teacher).' Sankha says 581 The offering of pinda and water should be done by the son for the father; in default (i. e. absence or death) of the son, the wife of the deceased) should offer, but in default of her the full brother.' The Visnupurāṇa 582 provides : *the son, grand-son, great grandson (of the deceased), the offspring of the brother (of the deceased), the offspring of a sapinda become entitled to offer (pinda).' The Mārkandeya purāņa provides (30. 19-21, chap. 27. 19-23 of the Venk, ed.) 'On failure of the sons, sapindas, on failure of them the samānoda kas, then the sapindas of the mother, and samānodakas of her, should perform these rites; a daughter's son should perform them (if the man dies sonless), the putrikāputra should perform them for his maternal grand-father; in default of all these, women should perform these rites for their husbands but without Vedio mantras; in default of wife the king should get the rites per formed by some one belonging to the family (of the deceased)

or by persons of his caste, since the king is the relative of all varnas.' 583 There was a close connection between taking the estate of a man and performing the rites after death up to the 10th day. For the doctrines represented by the Mitaksarā and the Dayabhāga, vide H. of Dh. vo). III pp. 734-743. Even those that regarded that inheri tance was based on relationship by blood and not on the capacity to offer pindas held that it was obligatory on everyone who took the estate of another (including the king who took as the ultimate heir by escheat) to arrange for the rites after death and śrāddha. Vispu 584 Dh. S, XV. 40 declares 

whoever inherits the estate of a deceased person has to offer pinda to him.' Yāj. II. 127 says the same thing about the Kṣetraja son (ubhayorapyasau rikthi piņda-dātā ca dharmataḥ). 

The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 94) states the order of adhikārins as follows; a competent son is the first adhikarī for offering pinda; in default of a son, husband, wife and co-wives; in default of these, the brother's son, the brother, daughter-in-law, daughter, daughter's son, any other sagotra, a sa pinda, a fellow-student, a friend, a pupil, the teacher, any relative and anyone who takes the wealth of the deceased may offer pinda. The father is not competent to perform śrāddha rites for his (deceased) son, an elder brother for his younger brother; these may even do so through affection but they cannot perform the sapindikarana. Parents may offer pinda to unmarried daugh ters, and even to married daughters in the absence of another (proper) giver. The daughter's son and the maternal grand father may offer to each other; the daughter's son to maternal grand-mother; the son-in-law and father-in-law to each other, the daughter-in-law to her mother-in-law, brothers among them selves, teacher and pupil to each other.

vol. II p. 739. The Nirnayasindhu 585 says that in the Kali age only two kinds of sons viz. aurasa and dattaka are allowed (out of the twelve mentioned by Yāj. II. 128–132) and the order of śrāddhādhikarins is given by it as follows: aurasa son, then grandson, then great grandson, then adopted son. If there are many sons then the eldest alone is the adhikarin; if the eldest be not present or is patita, then the son next to the eldest is the adhikārin (and not the youngest). If the sons are divided from each other, then all the rites up to sapiņdikarana are to be performed by the eldest alone who may make the other sons contribute to the expenses, but the yearly śrāddha may be per formed by each son separately. If the sons of the deceased) are not divided, then all rites including the yearly śrāddha also are to be performed by the eldest alone. When the eldest son not being present, the younger one or the youngest per forms the cremation, he should perform all rites up to and inclu ding the sixteen śrāddhas, but not sapiņdikarana and he should wait for one year for the arrival of the eldest. If the eldest comes to know of the death within one year, he alone should perform the sapindíkarapa. If the eldest son does not come even at the end of one year, then even the youngest may per form sapipdikarana. If before the expiry of one year the youngest son or some one other than a son performs the monthly, anumāsika, sapiņdikarana śrāddhas, then the eldest son or a son should again perform these. If there is a grandson who has his upanayana performed and there be a son whose upanayana is not performed it is the latter who is a preferable adhikārin, provided he is either three years old or has the cüdā ceremony performed as stated by Sumantu 586. Manu II. 172 states that a boy should not repeat the Veda before the performance of Upanayana except the mantras that are re quired for the srāddha of his deceased father or mother. Such a son may perform with Vedic mantras the funeral rites on the death of his father or mother and their yearly and other śrāddhas. If he is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, he may simply perform the cremation with mantras and the rest may be got performed through another person. In the

same way he should make only the declaration (sankalpa) of darśaśrāddha and mahālaya and the rest may be performed by some one else. An adopted son becomes an adhikarin for fune ral rites and the like only if the upanayana has been perforined. If there be no lineal descendant up to a great-grandson and also no adopted son, then the wife should perform with mantras the funeral rites and yearly and other sraddhas but if she is unable to repeat the Vedic mantras, then the same rules apply as in the case of an anu panīta son. Even if the husband be not divided from his brother, or he be re-united with his brother, it is the wife and not the brother who is to be preferred as having adhi kāra for sraddha, though the brother gets all the property. Though some of the latest works on dharmaśāstra like the Nirnayasindhu 587 and Dharmasindhu (bhāryayāpi samantrakam-eva-aurdhvadehikādikam kāryam) allowed the wife to perform rites after death with vedic mantras, several works such as the Markandeya-purāņa and the Brahmapurāņa did not allow the wife to repeat Vedic mantras (vide note 583 above). In default of the wife, the daughter has the right to perform rites after death if the deceased was separated and not re-united. But if the deceased was joint then his full brother would be the proper adhikarin after the wife. Among daughters the married one is preferred, though an unmarried daughter is a preferable heir. In default of daughters, the daughter's son is an adhikārin; then a brother, then a brcther's son. Among brothers a full brother is preferred to a half brother and if there be both elder and younger brothers, then the younger is preferred for performing rites after death (in order to make as near an approach as possible to the relation of father and son). If there be no younger brother, then even an elder one could be adhikarin; in default of full brother, a half brother. Some held that even if the deceased was separate from his brother and had a daughter or daughter's son as heir the funeral rites were to be performed by the brother (and not by the daughter or her son), since a sagotra is to be preferred as an adhikārin to one of a different gotra. If there be no brother, then a full brother's son was to be preferred, then the half brother's son, then father, then mother, then daughter-in-law, then sister. In case of there being

If there be many sister's sons, the rules as to brothers would apply. Then come paternal uncle, his son, other sapiņdas; 588 then samānodakas, then other persons born in the same family. In default of these, the sapindas of the mother, such as the maternal grand-father, maternal uncle, maternal uncle's son in that order; in default of the sapiņdas of the mother, the sons of the deceased's paternal or maternal aunt; in default of these the pitr-bandhus such as the sons of the father's father's sister, of the father's mother's sister, of father's maternal uncle; then the mātr-bandhus such as mother's father's sisters's son; in default of these, a disciple (of the deceased); in default of disciple, son-in-law of the deceased (or the father in-law of the deceased); in default of these, a friend; in default, any one who takes the wealth of a brāhmana (deceased); if the deceased was other than a brāhmana the king (who took the wealth of everyone dying heirless, except the wealth of a brāhmana) who arranges for funeral rites through another. 

In the case of women the following order of those entitled to perform rites of a deceased woman is given in the Dharma sindhu (p. 370); If the female be unmarried then her father is the adhikūrin, then her brother and the like; if the woman was married, her son, then her co-wife's son, then co-wife's grandson and then great-grandson; in default of these, the husband; in default of husband, daughter, then daughter's son; then husband's brother; then husband's brother's son; then daughter-in-law; then (the deceased) woman's father; then her brother; then her brother's son and the rest. 

An adopted son should perform the śrāddha of his natural father if the latter left no son or other adhikārī. If a brahma carin dies, his monthly, yearly and other śrāddhas should be performed by his father and mother. A brahmacārin may carry the dead body of his parents, or of his maternal grand-father, upādhyāya and acārya and perform the cremation and other rites; but if another adhikārin is available, he should not do these even for the parents and the other three.

should not at all carry the dead body of any one except of the above five or perform the cremation and other rites for any one e]se. If a brahmacārin performed all the rites for ten days he had to observe āśauca for ten days, but if he performed only the cremation he had to observe asauca only for one day. Even while in mourning his obligatory acts do not stop; but he should not eat the food cooked for his relatives that are in mourning nor should he dwell among them; if he did (both these ) he had to undergo prayascitta and perform upanayana again. 

It is somewhat curious that Baudhāyana, the Lingapurāpa (quoted in Srāddhaprakāśa pp. 361-371), the Mārkandeya purāṇa, the Pitrdayita (p. 82) and several other works allow man himself while living to perform his own rites after death (antyesti).589 This will be dealt with briefly later on under śrāddha. Further, if a man became patita and refused to undergo prāyascitta, he was driven out of the Hindu fold by the pro cedure of ghatasphota (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 387-388), and Gaut. Dh, S. 20.2 and Manu XI. 182-183 provide that such a man was to be held to be dead and his relatives were to perform 

all rites for him such as offering water and śrāddha and were also to observe āśauca for him.590 

Many commentators and digests quote certain verses of the Vispupurāņa (III. 13. 34-39) wherein the rites (kriyāḥ) after death performed for a person are enumerated as falling into three classes, viz. pūrva, madhyama and uttara. The rites from cremation up to the end of the 12th day are called pūrva, the śrāddhas performed monthly and sapindikarana and ekoddista are called madhyama rites and those that are performed after sapindikarana, when the deceased has reached the position of pitr after being a preta, are designated uttara.591 The pūrva and

madhyama rites of the deceased may be performed by the father, the mother, sapiņdas, samānodakas and those belonging to the deceased's group (gotra) or by the king if he takes the wealth of the deceased. But the rites called uttara are to be performed only by the son, grandson, great-grandson, daughter's son or the latter's sons. Even in the case of women, on the day of the anniversary of death every year an ekoddista śrāddha may be performed for them. There is also another classification of śrāddhas viz, Navašrāddha (those rites up to ten days after death), Navamiśra (those performed after ten days up to six seasons ), Purāna (those performed after a year ).591 a 

As stated above, for ten days after death a handful of water mixed with sesame was to be offered to the deceased on a stone (asman) placed on kusa grass and one large pinda (called püraka-pinda) was to be offered on kuģa grass everyday with the face to the south and the sacred thread on the right shoulder (prācīnāvīti) for the purpose of freeing the departed from the state of being a preta. On the pinda, water mixed with sesame was to be offered and leaves of Bhrngarāja (called mākā in Marathi) and Tulasi also. The verge 'anādi nidhano' was to be repeated 592. The performer throws the pinda in water and then bathes. Vide A. K. D. pp. 43-50 and Antyesti-paddhati of Nārāyaṇa for detailed treatment of the procedure of these ten days.

graddhas' (or Viṣamağrāddhas) performed on the uneven days (i. e. 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th ) with uncooked food. According to the Garudapurāpa (Pretakhanda 34. 36 which speaks of six śrāddhas on uneven days from 1st day to 11th) and Āpastamba they are six (Dharmasindhu p. 464, Nirnayasindhu p. 588, Śuddhiprakāśa pp. 214-216, Sraddhatattva p. 619) and accord ing to others there is an option. Angiras and Vasistha speak of six Navasrāddhas on uneven days from the 1st to the 11th, while Baud. Pitrmedha S. II. 10. 6 speaks of five. Some prescribe the placing of some cooked food sprinkled with ghee on the hand of a brāhmana. Others do not approve of this 

They prescribe the placing of uncooked corn in front of a brāh mapa or in front of a figure of a brāhmana made with kušas (called cata in Marathi). The Garudapurana (II. 5, 67 ff) holds that the navasrāddhas are those performed at the place where a man died, where the funeral procession rested on the way, when the bones were collected and those performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th day. The Suddhiprakāśa p. 214 quotes similar views from Kātyāyana and the view of VỊddha-Vasistha that the deceased does not become free from the status of a preta, unless the navasrāddhas are performed. The Garudapurāṇa, Pretakhanda (chap. 34. 27-28, 44, 48) states that by the pindas offered for ten days the several limbs of a subtle body are provided for the departed spirit which at first wanders like thin air. There are several differing views on the navašrāddhas which are passed over here. On the uneven days if navašrāddha is performed two pindas will be offered (one the daily one and the other, of the navasraddha). The Padma (Srstikhanda 10. 19) prescribes that one should not par take of the food at navaśrāddha and on doing so should undergo the cāndrāyaṇa expiation. 

In modern times, after the rites of the first day of crema. tion and of the collection of the bones, the rites for the dead generally begin on the 10th day. The performer goes to the place where the rites of the first day were performed, makes a sankalpa and offers a pinda with the words "May this pinda wait upon the preta named N. N. and of the gotra (Kasy apa &c.) in order that hunger and thirst affecting the presa may be removed'. Then he offers water mixed with sesame, plages leaves of bhrāgarāja and tulasi, repeats the verse Vanadini dhano' (note 592), removes the piņda to another placa fram the place where it was offered. Then he prepares arved with

loose earth with a triangular shape, purifies it by means of cowdung, decks it with turmeric powder and places thereon five jars full of water and on each of them a ball of rice. Then he offers a request to the middle jar with the words. May this pinda together with the jar of water wait upon the preta by name N. N., of such and such a gotra in order that his hunger and thirst may be allayed'. There is a prayer before the jars to the east, south, west and north respectively to those whom the preta had befriended, to Yama, to crows, to Rudra respectively. There is a difference of view here, some pres cribing four jars, some three, while others offer a pinda with the jar of water only on the place meant for the preta and mere pinda to others. Then water is offered over the pinda and to each of the above he offers sandals, umbrella, banner, bread. Then the performer waits till a crow seizes or eats the pinda placed to the west 594. Then the aśman (stone) is anointed with oil and cast in water. Then the performer requests the relatives, who offer one handful or three handfuls of water to the preta on the bank of the reservoir of water. Then the sons and others accor ding to usage cut their hair and nails. Then all persons of the same gotra, according to the custom of the country, bathe with sesame and myrobalan, wear pure and dried garments, go 

home and take their meals there. 

594. In modern times great importance is attached by many people to a crow touching and pecking at the pinda food. There is a common belief that if a crow does not touch the pinda then the deceased had some intense wish at his death that was unfulfilled and it is certainly heart-rend ing and a source of poignant sorrow even for passers-by to see the relatives waiting for hours and tempting the crow or crows to come down from trees with dainty pieces of copra and other things and also loudly declaring that they would do this or that and fulfil the last desire of the deceased. Often it so happens that no crow touches the pinda food in honour of the deceased, a very old and venerable man, and relatives are very much distressed to find that their venerable ancestor who could have hardly any ambition or desire at the advanced age of 0 or 90 (except to die speedily). judging from the reluctance of the crow, had some unfulfilled desire. Often the crow immediately touches the pinda offered to one who died very young (say 25 or 30 years old) and who would naturally be presumed to have many unfulfilled desires. In such cases the relatives feel very much relieved at the thought that their young relative passed away without any unfulfilled the desires. The Suddhikaumudi refers to this offering to crows as a usage was ob तथाचारात् काकबलिदानम् । पिण्डशेषमन्नं पात्रे कृत्वा अमुकगोत्रस्य प्रेतस्यामुकशी विशेषतृप्तये यमद्वारावस्थितवायसाय एष बलिर्न म इत्युत्सृज्य कृताक्षलिःकाक त्वं यमदूतोसि

Ethereal body after death 

265 

Some of the Puranas and medieval digests assert that after a man dies, the soul or spirit assumes what is called an ativūhika 594 a body consisting of three of the five elements (viz. fire, wind and akasa) that rise up from the dead body (while two viz. earth and water remain below), that such a body is obtained only by men and not by other beings, that with the aid of the pindas that are offered to the departed at the time of cremation and during ten days thereafter, the soul secures another body called bhogadeha (a body for enjoying the pindas offered) and that at the end of a year when sa pindikarana is performed, the soul secures a third body wherewith the spirit reaches heaven or hell according to the nature of his actions. The word 'ativahika' is comparatively an ancient one. It occurs in Vedantasutra IV. 3.4 (ativahikās-tal-lingat). But there the meaning is somewhat different. The Upaniṣads speak of the soul as going by the path of arcis, day &c. The sūtra says that these (viz. arcis, ahah &c.) are superintending deities that take the soul gradually onward by the path that leads to Brahma. Govindananda in his commentary on the Prāyaścitta viveka (pp. 13-14) holds that there are only two bodies (and not three as appears at first sight), viz. the ātivāhika or pretadeha and the bhogadeha. The belief was that the man on whose death no pinda was offered or the sixteen śrāddhas to be described below) were not performed remained for all time in the condi

The गरुडपुराण (प्रेतखण्ड chap. 10. 79. ff) says the same : 'उत्क्रामन्तं... ज्ञानचक्षुषः ॥ आतिवाहिकमित्येवं वायवीयं वदन्ति हि। ... पुत्रादिभिः कृताश्चेत्स्युः पिण्डा दश दशाहिकाः । पिण्डजेन तु देहेन वायुजश्चैकतां व्रजेत् । पिण्डतो यदि नैव स्याहायुजोहति यातनाम् ॥. The first verse (उत्क्रामन्तं) is गीता 15.10, The ब्रह्मपुराण states: विहाय सुमहत्कृत्स्नं शरीरं पाञ्चभौतिकम् ॥ अन्यच्छरीरमादत्ते यातनीय स्वकर्मजम् ।...स्वशरीरं समुत्सृज्य वायुभूतस्तु गच्छति । chap. 214. 29-30 and 51 ; निमित्त किंचिदासाय देही प्राणैर्विमुच्यते॥ अन्यच्छरीरमादत्ते यातनीय स्वकर्मभिः । अग्निशाणा 230. 2-3 ; गृह्णाति तत्क्षणायोगे शरीरं चातिवाहिकम् । आकाशवायुतेजांसि विग्रहाङ्का गामिनः । नलं मही च पञ्चत्वमापन्नः पुरुषः स्मृतः । आतिवाहिकदेहं तु यमदूता नयन्ति तम् ।।आग्न. 371.9-10.

tion of a piśāca, from which he would not be freed even if numerous other śrāddhas were later on offered for him.595 The Brahmapurāņa calls the body 'yātaniya'(i.e. one that has to undergo trials and torments), while the Agnipurāṇa calls it 

yātāniya' or 'ātivāhika' and asserts that this body is made up of the elements of akāša, vāyu and tejas. The Padmapurāņa (II. 67. 98 ) states that persons who commit certain sins secure after death a body similar in shape to the physical body for undergoing torments. The underlying conception was that when the gross body was destroyed after death by cremation, burial or other methods an intermediate subtile body had to be built up before the departed soul was compelled to assume another body in a fresh incarnation, The subtile body was gradu ally built up, as stated by the Mārk, 10.73, by the rites performed on death and on several days after death. Though this con ception is very clearly set forth in the Purāṇas it should not be supposed that it was altogether a new one. It had its roots deep down in the earliest Vedic period and was implicit in some of the hymns as indicated by Rg. X. 15. 14, X. 16. 4-5 translated above. Though in the Tai. S. I. 8. 5. 1-2 and in passages of the Tai. Br, and Sat. Br. to be set out later on it is said that the offerings are made to the paternal ancestors, it does not follow that the brāhmaṇas were not fed at the same time on the food prepared for being offered to the ancestors, just as in the solemn Vedic sacrifices offerings were made to the gods, Agni, Indra, Prajāpati, Visņu and others and at the same time priests engaged in the sacrifices were fed and given presents ( daksiņā). Therefore, it need not be necessarily sup posed that feeding the brahmanas at grāddha was a later idea and offering food to the dead was the original idea.

CHAPTER VIII 

SUDDHI 

Suddhi (purification ) is a very comprehensive topic including within it purification after āśauca (impurity on birth and death), purification of a person after contact with an impure object or on account of certain occurrences. purification of pots, wells, food &c., after they are polluted. Ašauca. however, is the most important subject under suddhi and therefore the Suddhi.kaumudi 'defines 'suddhi' as 'the state of being fit for or capable of performing the rites that are understood from the Veda.' 596 The Surtis employ the word suddhi in relation to purification after āśauca. For example, Manu V.57 starts by saying that he will expound purification after a man is dead ( pretaśuddhi) and purification of things (dravyasuddhi). Manu V. 83 ( = Daksa VI. 7) avers that a brāhmaṇa becomes pure after ten days (on the death or birth of a relative), a ksatriya after twelve &c. The Parāśara-smrti starts chapter three by declaring 'I shall expound suddhi on birth and death.' Yaj. III. 14, 25 also employ the word suddhi. Therefore aśauca on birth and death will be first dealt with. 

The word āśauca is formed from suci (pure) according to Pan. V. 1.131 596 a and Pān. VII. 3, 30 (vide note below) with the negative particle na (a). In some smrtis such as that of Devala the formāśucya' also is found (see Hāralatā pp. 2, 9, 36 in quotations from Devala 596 6). Another word which is often used as a synonym for āśauca is 'agha'. It has been seen above (p. 6) that the word agha means 'sin' in the Vedic Literature (as in Rg. I. 97, 1-8, X. 117.6). But in the Sān, Śr. IV. 15. 11,

Manu V. 84 (na vardhayed-aghāhāni) the word 'agha' has come to mean the same thing as āśauca. 597 The Padmapurāṇa II. 66. 73-74 states that since the outlets of the body always enit mucus, urine &c. it is always impure. 

The Mit. on Yāj. III. 1 definos 598 āśauca as an emergent attribute attaching to a person, which is got rid of by lapse of time or a bath and the like and which is the cause of the positive direction to offer to a deceased person) pinda, water and the like and of the cessation of Vedic study and other actions. The Mit. adds that āśauca is not merely the absence of the privilege or power to do religious acts, since even those who have incurred impurity (on death &c.) are enjoined to do certain religious acts such as offering water (to the deceased). This definition of the Mit, appears to be an echo of the Garuda purana ( pretakhanda) 5. 9 and is probably based on a verse of the work called Sangraha. Haradatta 599 on Gautama 14. 1 states that asauca may be defined as the absence of the privilege to perform religious acts, unfitness for being one whose food may be partaken of, untouchability and the loss of the privilege to make religious gifts. A comparatively early writer Bhattācārya, 600 appears to have defined 'suddhi' as the 

removal of sin' or as being fit for performing religious acts This was accepted by the Smrti-candrikā, but rejected by Nandapandita, commentator of Şadaśīti (pp. 2-3). Even the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 18) emphasizes that asaucas has two characteristics, viz, it takes away the privilege of performing

religious acts and it renders a person untouchable. The Smrtimuktāphala follows this. Rudradhara in his Suddhiviveka (D. C. ms, No. 309 of 1887-91 folio 1) says that suddhi is a special attribute which brings about a capacity or privilege for the performance of all dharmas, while asuddhi is an attribute opposed to suddhi and arises on the occasion of the birth of a sapiņda or the like. 601 

Asauca is of two kinds, viz, that arising on birth 602 (and so called jananāśauca or sūtaka) and that arising on death (and therefore called śāvāśauca or mstakāśau ca or maranāśauca). šana is derived from śava (meaning a corpse). The word sütaka occurs in the 603 Ait. Br. (chap. 32.8) and is there probably used in the sense of impurity on both birth and death. There it is said that if an āhitāgni partook of food from the house of him who was affected by sūtaka, then the prāyaścitta was to offer a purodāśa cooked on eight potsherds to Agni Tantumat. Tantu means also 'son or progeny' and so it may bə argued that it is an indication that sūtaka is used in the Ait. Br. in the sense of impurity on birth. The word sütaka is used in the smrtis in three senses: (1) impurity on birth (vide Manu V. 58); (2) impurity both on birth and death, as in Gobhilasmrti III. 6) and 63; 604 (3) impurity on death alone (as in Daksa VI. 1 and Gobhilasmrti III. 48 ) 605. In some of the modern vernaculars (such as Marathi) the word "gūtaka' is used in the 3rd sense alone. In each of these two divisions there are two varieties viz. where the duration is brief or com paratively long (Sadašiti, verse 2). 

A question arises why birth and death should cause im purity to the members of the family or to relatives, Only a

few have to say anything on this question, Harita says: 'the family incurs death impurity because by death the family feels overwhelmed (or frustrated), while when a new life appears the family increases (and there is gratification or joy) 606 

The literature on Suddhi (including āšauca) is very exten sive. Apart from the sūtras, smrtis and Purānas there are numerous digests dealing with the subject at great length. Some of them have been printed. The smrtis contain a mass of contradictory dicta to such an extent and different from the usages of medieval times that the Mit. on Yaj. III. 22 after quoting the views of Parāśara, Śatātapa, Vasistha and Angiras on the periods for which impurity had to be observed by por sons belonging to the four varnas refuses to evolve order out of then and remarks that the usages in its day were diffe rent from the dicta of those sages 607. The Madana-pārijāta (p. 392) agrees with the Mit. and also suggests other modes of dealing with the conflict. Two examples may be cited of the way in which different smrtis approach the same problem, Atri 83, Parāśara III, 5 and Daksa VI, 6 provide that a brāhmana who has consecrated the three Vedic fires and has mastered the Veda becomes free from impurity (on birth and death ) in one day, one who has merely mastered the Veda ( but has not consecrated the grauta fires ) in three days and one who is devoid of both in ten days. Manu V.59 gives various options viz. 10 days, 4 days, 3 days, 1 day but does not state explicitly to whom his remarks apply. Brhaspati 607 a(q.

by Hāralatā p. 5 and Haradatta on Gautama 14. 1) states that a brāhmana who is endowed with Veda and srauta fires becomes pure after three days, one who is devoid of srauta fires (but is master of the Veda) in five days and one who is only a brahmana by caste (has not studied the Veda or does not teach it ) in ten days. The Sān, Sr. and Manu 608 (both quoted above) urge a man not to increase through laziness the number of days for which impurity is to be observed. It is possible that persons claiming to be learned observed impurity for a few days only, while neighbours disputed their claim to this special dispensation in favour of Vedic learning and keeping srauta fires. The result was that later on a flat number of ten days was prescribed for all brahmanas whether learned or not and the provision for lesser number of days of impurity was relegated to Kalivarjya usages. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 941-42. 

Another example of the dependence of the days of impurity on the caste of the deceased and of varying dicta thereon may be cited, Manu V. 83, Daksa VI. 7, Yāj. III. 22, Atri (verse 85), Sankha (15. 2-3), Matsyapurāṇa (18. 2-3), Brahmapurana 220.63, Visnu Dh. S. 22. 1-4, all lay down periods of 10 days, 12 days, 15 days and a month for impurity among brāhmanas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras respectively. Yaj. III.22 makes the virtuous sūdra observe impurity only for 15 days as a concession. Gaut. (15.1-4) prescribes 10, 11, 12 days (or half month) and a month respectively for the four varnas, while Vas. (4.27-30) gives the periods of 10, 15, 20 and one month for the four varnas. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar, in his article on Nagara brāhmanas and Kayasthas of Bengal, protests that the Kāyasthas of Bengal (owing to social tyranny) still obserye āśauca for one month as if they are ordinary śūdras (I. A. for 1932 at p. 71). On the other hand, Angiras ( quoted by the Mit, on Yaj. III, 22 ) states that Śatātapa declared that all varnas become purified after ten days whether the impurity is due to birth or death,609 Parāśara (III. 9) quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. III, 18

provides that a sapinda who is 4th in descent from the common ancestor of the deceased and himself becomes pure after ten days, one who is 5th after 6 days, one who is 6th in descent after four days and one who is 7th after one day. The Mit. says that this should be discarded as it is in conflict with many other smrtis and is disapproved of by people.610 Some of the rules mentioned by Vijñāneśvara (about 1100 A, D.) themselves underwent changes in 500 years as noted by the Nirnayasindhu (composed in 1612 A. D. 611). 

The Mit, on Yaj. III, 18 declares that when a child that has not completed two years dies, it is the parents that have to observe asauca for ten days and not all sapindas and that their āśauca entails untouchability for them. The Nirņayasindhu (p. 517) remarks that what Vijñānesvara said is not now (in its time) the usage and that the Smrtyarthasāra also did not accept Vijñāneśvara's view, 

In view of the above-mentioned circumstances no useful purpose would be served by setting out in detail the varying dicta of the smrtis, Purānas 612 and the digests upon the several matters that fall to be treated under āśauca. Digests on this subject are too numerous to mention. The following printed ones and a few mss, have been made use of in preparing the following account. In the first place, there are several works that deal with this subject in verse. The Asaucāstaka attri buted to Vararuci (published in the Trivandrum series) with a

Works on āśauca 

273 

commentary by an anonymous writer that names the bhāsya of Maskarin on Gautama-dharmasūtra (on p. 35) deals with the subject in eight sragdharā verses. The Aśaucadaśaka or Dašašloki attributed to Vijñāneśvara seems to have been a very popular work. There are several commentaries on it. The one by Harihara is the earliest of them. In the Deccan College collection of Mss (now at the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute, Poona) there are several Mss of it, two of which were copied in saivat 1539 (D. C. No. 216 of 1879-80) and samvat 1579 (D.C, No. 196 of 1884-87) and which expressly state that the work. was composed by Vijñāneśvara-yogindra. The ten śārdüla vikridita verses of the Aśaucadasaka are set out in the appendix, The Kalpataru of Laksmīdhara has a section on śuddhi which has been recently published in the G.O.S. The Hāralatā of Aniruddha is very useful (B. I. Series). The Aśaucakānda of the Smrticandrikā has been edited by the late Dr. Shamsastry and published as No. 56 of the Mysore University Sanskrit publica tions. The Trimsacchloki with the commentary of Raghunatha composed in sake 1645 has been published at the Poona Ananda śrama press and contains 30 Sragdharā verses on āśauca. The Sadašīti ( 86 verses in the Anustubh metre ) of Kausikāditya with the commentary Suddhicandrikā by Vināyaka alias Nanda pandita (composed about 1600 A. D.) has been published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series. The Suddhikaumudi of Govinda nanda (B. I. Series ); the Suddhitattva of Raghunandana (ed. by Jivananda pp. 233-412), the Suddhiprakāśa (part of the Viramitrodaya of Mitramiśra ) published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series, the Suddhimayükha of Nilakantha (edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) and the Smộtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha (edited by Mr. J. R. Gharpure) are compilations that are useful in their own way. These exhaustive treatises on asauca show one thing unmistakably that brāhmaṇas of the medieval ages attached an extremely exaggerated importance to ceremonial purity of the body on birth and death. 

The periods of impurity depended on many circumstanoes. There was a difference between impurity on birth and that on death; so also the duration depended upon whether the deceased was an infant or a male or a female or one whose uparayana had been performed or not performed; it depended on caste and also on the question whether the deceased died near the relative or far away; also upon the degree of relationship; and on the time that elapsed from the birth or death till it reached the bars

of the relative. The intensity of impurity was different in each of the following: a sütikā (a freshly delivered woman), rajasvalā (woman in monthly illness ), impurity on death, impurity on birth (the last being the least). 

Daksa (VI, 2-3) states that there are ten varieties in impurity, viz. immediate purity ( after taking a bath ), one day, three days, four days, six days, ten days, twelve days, a fort night, a month and till the end of one's life.613 Daksa then explains in what cases these different periods apply. As to what is meant by impurity till life's end (lit, till he is reduced to ashes), Daksa ( VI. 8-10 ) says: 'those who take their meals without bathing or offering to gods or without making gifts all such persons are in impurity till life ends. One who is permanently afflicted with a disease, who is close-fisted (i.e. stints himself, wife and son and religious acts through greed), who is always in debt (i. e. who has not paid off his debts to gods, sages and manes), who is bereft of religious acts ( nitya or naimittika), who is a fool and is under the thumb of his wife, whose mind is bent on vices (gambling, prostitution &c. ), who is always dependent (a king's servant or the like), who is devoid of faith and benevolence (charitable gifts -he incurs impurity which ends only with his ashes (i. e, only when he is cremated). 614 These words are not to be taken literally; what is meant is that such a man is to be shunned by others (i. e, it is an arthavāda conveying merely censure). 

We shall now turn to the impurity on birth. 

That the impurity on birth lasted for ten days even in Vedic times can be inferred from the story of Sunah-sepa narrated in the Ait. Br. (chapter 33, 2), where occurs the passage 'when the animal is more than ten days from birth he becomes pure (and fit to be offered in sacrifice).' The same

inference can probably be drawn from Tai. Br, II, 1. 1.3, where it is said therefore people do not take the milk of a cow for ten nights when a calf is born.' 615 

Abortion in the first four months 616 of pregnancy is called srāva, abortion in the 5th or 6th month is called pāta and from the 7th month of pregnancy onwards it is called prasūti or prasava ( according to Parāśara III, 16, Şadasiti verse 9). When there is srāva the mother incurs impurity for three days, in the case of pāta the mother has to observe impurity for as many days as correspond to the months of pregnancy (i. e. 5 days or 6 days). The impurity consists in the mother being untouchable. The father alone has to bathe when there is srāva, but when there is pāta the father and sapindas have to observe impurity for three days (according to Madana-pārijāta p. 380-381 and others) but they don't incur impurity as on death. These rules hold good for all castes. But when the foetus comes out dead in any month from the 7th or the child is still-born, then the impurity is for ten days for both parents and the sapiņdas for all varnas or for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varnas as laid down in Yāj.

Even when sagotras have to observe āśauca on birth they are not untouchable (Şadasīti verse6). 

It would be better to state here certain general rules once for all. When any text employs the word day (ahah) or night (rātri) in prescribing the duration of asauca what is meant is ahorātra (both day 622 and night). When counting the days of aśauca one has to begin from the day of the cremation, if the deceased was an āhitāgni, but from the day of death in the case of one not an āhitāgni 623 ( Āśauca-daśaka verse 4, Kūrma, Uttarārdha 23.52). Birth and death are causes of asauca only when they are known to the person who is to be affected by it and not by the mere fact of the birth or death. This follows from certain

General rules about āśauca 

passages of Pāraskara gr. III. 10 and Manu V. 75-76 and the Brahmapurāņa. Pāraskara (III. 10) provides : 624 'if one who had gone abroad dies, (his relatives) should on hearing (of his death) sit down and offer him water and should remain untouchable for the days that remain out of the proper period (viz. 10, 12, 15, 30 days); if the prescribed period of aśauca ) has expired they should observe āśauca for one night or three nights,' Manu (V.75-76) is to the same effect. The Brahmapurāņa states: 'if a donor makes a gift and the acceptor accepts it when both are not aware of there being a birth or death in their family, no blame attaches.' 

We should now turn to āśauca on death. Here again there is no unanimity and therefore the views perferably of the latest works (such as the Dharmasindhu) will be set out after referring to a few smrti passages. Āsauca on death renders those who incur it untouchable and unable to perform religious rites. Pār. gr. III, 10. 29-30 (S. B. E. vol. 29 p. 357) stated gene rally that the impurity caused by death lasts through three nights and that according to some teachers through ten nights. If a child dies within ten days of birth, the father and mother have to observe Jananāśauca and become purified by the end of the āśauca on birth and the father remains untouchable for those days (Kūrma-purāņa q. by S. K, p. 21). If a child died before it struck teeth the sapindas had only to undergo a bath, while the parents had to observe asauca for three days if the child was a son and for one day if a daughter (vide Yāj. III. 23, Sankha 15. 4, Atri 95, Āśaucadaśaka verse 2). If the child died after striking teeth but before Cūdā (or the end of the third year) the sapiņdas had to observe āśauca for one day and night (Yaj. III. 23, Sankha 15, 5), but the parents had āśauca (of death) for three days. If the child was a girl the sapindas became pure by a bath up to the girl's third year. If death occurs between Cūdā (or three years) and upanayana or marriage (in the case of girls) the sapindas including the father have to observe āśauca for three days and samānodakas become purified by a bath alone. After upa nayana all sapiņdas have to observe āśauca (on death ) for ten days (Gaut. 14, 1, Manu V. 59, Aśaucadašaka 2/and all samānodakas for three days. In the case of a sodra dying

after three and before marriage or 16 years the āśauca is three days for all sapindas. After sixteen years or marriage (in the case of a śūdra) it is the āśauca prescribed for his caste. In the case of a girl dying after three years and before vāgdāna (betrothal) the parents have āśauca for three days and the sapipdas (up to three generations ) one day. If a girl dies after vāgdāna and before marriage the sapindas of her father as well as of the proposed bridegroom had to observe āśauca for three days. In the case of women and šūdras if death takes place after marriage or after 16 years (if the Sūdra was unmarried) the period of āśauca for all sapindas is ten days. If a woman dies at her father's house after marriage, her parents, step-mother, full brothers and step-brothers have to obserye āśauca for three days and her paternal uncle and the like that stay in the same house with her father for one day. Some say that if the married daughter dies in a village other than that of the father, the parents have to observe āśauca for a pakṣiņā 625 (i. e. two nights with a day between or two days with a night between). There are other views on this point which are passed over. For example, Viṣnu-dharmasütra (22. 32-34) says that in the case of a married woman there is no āśauca on the parents' side; but when she is delivered of a child or dies in the father's house then the impurity is for one day or three days respectively. 626 A. married woman has to observe āśauca for three days for the death of her parents or step-mother if ten days have not elapsed from the day of death or for the remaining days out of the period of ten (Yaj. III, 21 latter half). If the married daughter hears of the death of the parents or step-mother at a time more than ten days after the death or within one year she has to observe āśauca for a paksipi. If a brother whose upanayana has been performed dies at his married sister's house or vice versa, āśauca has to be observed for three days by them, but if they do not die at each other's house but in a different one

Rules about āśauca on death 

279 

then the āśauca is for a paksini and if the death occurs in another village then there is āśauca only for one day. The same rules apply to step-brothers and step-sisters and also among sisters. A married woman on the death of her paternal grand-father or paternal uncle has to undergo only a bath. If a maternal uncle dies, the nephew and the niece have to observe aśauca for a paksiņi. If the maternal uncle dies in the house of the nephew then there is āśauca for three days and for only one day if the maternal uncle had not his upanayana performed or died in another village; the same rules apply to one's mother's step-brother. If the wife of a maternal uncle dies, the nephew or the niece of the maternal uncle have to undergo āśauca for a paksini. If a nephew whose thread ceremony has been performed dies, his maternal uncle and maternal aunt have āśauca for three days. The same rules apply if the deceased be the son of a step-sister of the maternal uncle. If the niece (sister's daughter) dies there is only a bath for the maternal uncle. If a maternal grandfather dies, the grandchild (the son or daughter of a daughter) has to observe āśauca for three days, but only for a pakṣini if the maternal grandfather dies in a different village. On the death of the matornal grand mother the grandchildren have to observe aśauca for a paksini, Some works do not prescribe āśauca for a female descendant such as a niece or grand-daughter. If a daughter's son, whose upanayana had been performed, died, the maternal grandfather and grandmother had to observe āśauca for three days and for paksipi if the daughter's son had not upanayana performed for him. On the death of a daughter's daughter the maternal grandfather and mother incur no āsauca. In all these matters the general rule is that a male whose upanayana had been performed and a married woman alone are liable to undergo aśauca for any relative other than the parents (i. e, on the death of a parent a male though without upanayana and a woman though unmarried are liable to undergo āśauca). 

If a man's father-in-law or mother-in-law die near (in the house of) the man, he has to undergo āśauca for three days, but only for paksini if the death is elsewhere than with the son-in law. On the death of a son-in-law, the father-in-law etrid the mother-in-law have to observe āśauca for one day or they have only to take a bath, but if the son-in-law dies in the house of the father-in-law then the āśauca is for three days. On the death of one's wife's brother, the āśauca is for ometarkaden en

upanayana had been performed; but if no upanayana was performed or if he died in another village a mere bath is enough. 

On the death of one's mother's sisters (full or half) the person (whether man or woman) has to undergo āśauca for a pakṣiņi; the same rule applies on the death of the father's sister. If it is a step-sister of the father then a mere bath is enough. The father's sister has to undergo a bath if the nephew dies. If one's father's sister or mother's sister dies in one's house then the āśauca is for three days. 

In the case of bandhus (described by the Mit. on Yāj. II. 135 as bhinnagotra sapindas) of 627 the three kinds, the āśauca is for a paksiņi, provided the bandhu is upanīta but if he died before upanayana then āśauca is for one day and if the bandhu died in one's house then for three days. If the daughter of the father's sister (and of the other bandhus enu merated in the three verses) dies married, the āsauca is one day, but if they die unmarried only a bath is necessary. Among the three kinds of bandhus, a man himself and his three ātmabandhus have to observe asauca for each other's death; but the case is different as to pit rbandhus and mātr bandhus. If any one of these latter dies, there is āśauca for the man whose bandhus they are, but if a man dies, his pits bandhus and mātrbandhus have to observe no āsauca. 

If an adopted son dies, his natural father and adoptive father have to observe āśauca for three days (the Vyavahāra mayükha differs from this ) and the sapiņdas for one day. 

If the adoptive or natural father dies, the adopted son has to observe asauca for three days and for one day for the sapindas of any one of them. On the death of the son and the grandson of an adopted son, the sapindas of the natural father and the adoptive father have to observe āśauca for one day and

vice versa. These rules apply if the son adopted is not a sapinda or samānodaka of the adopter, when he was in his family of birth. But if a sagotra sapinda or a samānodaka be adopted, then the āśauca is for ten or three days respectively. 

If one's ācārya 628 dies, the pupil has to observe āśauca for three days, but only one day if he dies in another village (Gautama 14, 26, 52, Manu V. 80). On the death of the ācārya's wife or son the āśauca is for one day. 629 On the death of a guru (who instructs in Vedic mantras) the āśauca is three days and paksini if he dies in another village. On the death of a teacher who imparted instruction in grammar, astronomy and other angas (subsidiary lores) of the Veda, the āśauca is one day. Similar rules are laid down about the death of a pupil, rtvik (sacrificial priest), a sacrificer, a dependent śrotriya, a fellow-student, a friend, which are all passed over as not now useful. Vide Gaut, 14. 19-20 (which prescribe one day's āśauca on the death of a fellow-student or a dependent śrotriya). 

These provisions about āśauca on the death of the ācārya and ștvik who were not sapindas show how closely the bond between teacher and pupil was thought to be in ancient times, almost equalling the tie of blood. When a yati (ascetic) dies, 630 all his sapindas have simply to undergo a bath (and nothing more). Conversely, a yati and brahmacārin have to observe no āśauca. Manu V. 82, Yāj. III. 25, Visnu 22.45. Sankha 15. 15 provide that on the death of the ruler of the country in which one resides one has to observe āśauca up till 

628. An ācārya is defined by Manu II. 140 as one who performs the upanayapa of his pupil and teaches him the Veda together with the Kalpasūtra and Upanisads. Rtvik is defined by Manu II. 143 as one who is chosen for the performance of Agnyadheya, the pakayajñas and the solemn sacrifices like Agnistoma.

As long as a corpse is not removed from the village in which a man dies, the whole village is in asauca. A.p. Dh. S. 1. 3. 9. 14 declares that there is no Veda study till a corpse lies in the village. The Smrti-muktāphala (p. 541) quotes 632 several smrtis to the effect that in a village in which a corpse lies unremoved, there is to be no eating, no Vedic study and no sacrifice, but that this does not apply where in a village there are more than four hundred brāhmaṇas. The Dharma sindhu (p. 433) also says the same about a village, but adds that this rule does not apply to a town. 

The ideas of ritualistic purity went so far as to provide (as stated in the Suddhitattva quoted by the Nirnayasindhu) that if a dog died in a brāhmaṇa's house the house became impure for ten days, that, if a sudra,633 apatita or amleccha died in a brāhmana's house, the house became impure for a month, two months or four months respectively and the house had to be abandoned if a svapāka died therein. 

Atikrāntāśauca (impurity on coming to know of birth or death after the several periods fixed). The general rule 634 is

III. 25 (निवासराजनि प्रेते तदहः शुद्धिकारणम्) is explained by the Mit. in the same sense as मनु V. 82, but the शुद्धिप. p. 36 holds that the asauca for king's death is for a whole day and night provided he is a good king protecting his subjects. _632. स्मृत्यन्तरे। ग्रामस्थे शवचण्डाले शूद्राद्यशुचिसंनिधौ ॥ नाध्येतव्यं न भोक्तव्यं न होतव्यं कदाचन॥ इति।...स्मृत्यन्तरे विशेषो दर्शितः । चतु:शताधिकैविप्रैः सम्पूर्णे ग्राममध्यके। विशेषं संप्रवक्ष्यामि जपहोमार्चनं प्रति। अन्तःशवस्य दोषस्तु नास्ति तत्र समाचरेत् । स्मृतिमु.

that, if a person stays in a different country and hears of a birth or death among his sapindas, he has to observe āśauca not for ten days after hearing but for that number of days that are short of the ten days (counting from birth or death) pre scribed for sapiņdas. Vide Manu V. 75, Yāj. III. 21 (latter half), Sankha 15.11, Pār. gr. III. 10. Āśauca interferes very much with one's activities and it is hence that often-tines people send a closed letter to their relatives living in a different place stating thereon that it be opened on a particular day (which is the 10th day from the death of a sapiņda). Every one knows the meaning of such a direction and by such a subterfuge inconvenience is avoided and the dictates of the śāstra are deemed to be satisfied. If a son hears of the death of a parent he has to observe āśauca for ten days from the day of hearing, but if he hears of the death of a parent before the collection of bones then he has to observe āśauca only for the days that remain (Smrti-muktāphala p. 534). There is great divergence about the period of āśauca if the death of a sapiņda comes to one's ears more than ten days after the day of death. Manu V.77 provides that on hearing of the death of a sapinda or the birth of a son after ten days from the event) a man be comes pure after plunging into water with the clothes on and Yāj. III. 21 (last pāda, 'pürne dattyodakam suciḥ') states that he becomes pure after a bath and) offering water when the period fixed has passed off. From the words of Manu that only the father, even if he hears of the birth of a son more than ten days after the event, has to take a bath the Mit. infers that there is no atikrāntāśauca for sapiņdas on birth 635. The Mit. quotes Devala in support (vide note 621 above). The Dharma sindhu follows the Mit. Manu V. 76, Sankha 15.12, Kūrma purāṇa (Uttarārdha) 23,21 state that when ten days have passed after the event of death, the man who hears of the death is impure for three days and if he hears of the death more than a year after death, he becomes pure after a bath. In order to remove the conflict among smrtis Vrddha-Vasistha lays down: 'āśauca is for three days if the news of death is heard within three months (but later than ten days after death), for a paksiņi if it is heard within six months (but later than

three months), for one day if heard before nine months (but later than 6 months ) and thereafter (i. e, up to one year but later than nine months ) one becomes pure by a bath. But the Mit, says 636 that this holds good as to all except one's parents and quotes Paithinasi and another smộti for the proposition that whenever a son staying in a distant country hears of the death of a parent whether within a year or after a year he has to observe āśauca for ten days from the day he becomes aware of it. Laghu-Āśvalāyana (20.88) lays down the same exception in the case of a son. The Mit. (on Yāi. III. 21 last half) further says that the rules about atikrāntāśauca apply only to a deceased person whose upanayana had been performed. The Dharmasindhu (p. 433 ) remarks that there is no atikrāntāśauca as regards the periods of one day and three days prescribed on the death of one whose upanayana had not been performed or as regards the periods of paksini and three days on the death of the maternal uncle and others of a different gotra. Similarly, there is no atikrāntāśauca with reference to the āśauca for three days prescribed in the case of samānodakas; but in these cases even after the lapse of the fixed time a bath is necessary. The rules about atikrāntāśauca apply only to āśauca on death for ten days. As in the case of the son, so in the cases of husband and wife and of co-wives among themselves even after the lapse of more than a year and even if the death is in a different country the husband or wife or co-wife has to observe asauca for ten days. The parents, even when they hear of the death of an aurasa son after a year, have to observe āśauca for three days. On the news of the death of a sapinda living in the same country coming to a sapinda's ears after ten days but up to three months, the period of aśauca is three days, pakṣipi up to 6 months, up to nine months one day and up to one year a bath. Here also there are various views such as those of Mādhava and others. Vide Suddhiprakāśa pp. 49-51 for various views.

In the latter case the sapindas coming to hear of the death after ten days but even before three months are purified by a mere bath. It quotes 637 a smrti verse on hearing that a person (sapinda) died in another country and in the case of the death of an impotent person or a forest hermit or an ascetic purification follows after a bath and the same applies to sagotra sapindas in the case of abortion,' The Sadaśīti (35) has a similar verse.638 The Mit. quotes two verses of Brhaspati which define what deśāntara (a different country ). means: 639 Where there is a large river or there is a mountain which separates (one territory from another ) or where the languages differ then there is deśāntara. Some say that a different country means the distance of sixty yojanas, while others put it down at forty yojanas and still others at thirty ?/ojanas.' There is a difference of opinion as to whether in order to constitute a different country all three must co-exist (viz, a large river, a mountain and difference of speech) or any one of the three will suffice or whether 60, 40 or 30 yojanas would constitute a different country or whether the require ment of ten days for news to be carried to a place would constitute desantara. The Sm. C. and Sadasiti 37 hold the view that any one of the above three is sufficient while others hold other views. The Suddhivivek a 640 holds that a distance of 60 yojanas constituted deśāntara by itself, but even within sixty

yojanas if a large river, a mountain and difference of speech occurred together, that could give rise to deśāntara. The Smrtyarthasāra 641 avers that deśāntara is differently described in the Smrtis, Purāṇas and the works on tirthas. For yojana, vide H. of Dh. vol. III n. 185 pp. 145-146. 

The Dharmasindhu (p. 435) provides that if the bones of an āhitāgni were not found and only an effigy of palāśa leaves were burnt, still the āśauca is for ten days even if he died in a different country and a long time had elapsed. Similarly, in the case of the effigy of one who is not an āhitāgni, the āśauca is for ten days for his son and wife if they have not already observed any āśauca for him but if they had observed it (on hearing of his death ) then for three days (on the burning of the effigy ). For other sapindas (than the son and wife ) in the same circumstances three days and bath are respectively prescribed. 

It is provided in the Grhya kārikas, the Smrtyarthasāra (p. 94), Dharmasindhu (p. 435) and other works that if a man 642 went to a distant country and no news of his being alive was heard, then his son or other relative), after the lapse of 20 years from the time when no news was heard if the man went away when he was young or 15 years if he left when he was of middle age or 12 years if he left later in life, should perform three cāndrāyaṇas or thirty kịcchras, prepare an effigy of the man with kusas (or with palāśa leaves ), should burn it and then observe āśauca and perform śrāddhas &c. 

To summarize the above discussion it is clear that as indicated by Medhātithi on Manu V. 58 there is a distinction as regards the periods of aśauca and the persons affected by it in several ways. (1) There is a distinction between āśauca on birth and āśauca on death; (2) As to aśauca on death numerous distinctions arise viz. (a) when there is abortion (garbhasrāva or garbhapāta, as in Sankha 15. 4, Br̥hat-Parāśara VI. p. 186 ); (b) when the foetus comes out from the 7th to the 9th month of

pregnancy or the child is still-born or dies after being born but before the appearance of teeth (Yāj. III. 23, Atri 95); (c) after the appearance of teeth but before cūdā or three years (Viṣnu 22. 29, Yāj. III. 23); (d) after cüdā or three years up to upanayana (Manu V. 67); (e) after upanayana (Yaj. III, 23, Manu V. 59, Gaut. 14. 1); (f) as to āśauca on death after upanayana the duration at one time depended in the case of brahmanas on Vedic study, the performance of srauta rites and whether the brāhmana subsisted on ears of corn left in the field after the crops were harvested 643 (Parāśara TII, 5, Sankha 15.1, Atri 83, Agnipurāņa 158. 10-11); (g) the duration of āśauca depended on caste (Gaut. 14. 1-4, Yāj. III. 22 &c. ); (h) the duration of āśauca depended on nearness of blood i, e. whether the person affected was a sapipda or a samānodaka (Gaut. 14. 1 and 18, Manu V. 59, 64); (i) the duration depended also on the nearness or distance from the place of death (Laghu-Āśvalāyana 20. 85, 89); (j) it also depended on whether the deceased died in a different country separated by a large river, a mountain or thirty yojanas (Laghu-Āśvalāyana 20.87); (k) duration depended on the time that elapsed before it came to the knowledge of the relative; (1) the duration depended upon whether another āśauca supervened when the period of the first was not over. 

If a person is born or died at night or news thereof is received at night, a question arises as to from what day the periods of āsauca are to be calculated. For example, if a man died at 1 A. M. on Monday, was Monday to be included in counting ten days of āśauca or was it to be excluded ? There are two views on this point. 643a One view is that any time before midnight is to be counted as belonging to the previous day, while any time after midnight is to be taken as belonging to the next day. On this view in the above illustration Monday would be excluded in the calculation of ten days. The other view is that the night is to be divided into three

parts and if death occurs in the first two of the three parts then the day is to be included in the calculation; if the time of death falls in the 3rd part, the ten days are to be calculated from the next day. On this view Monday would be included in the tən days. The Dharmasindhu (p. 435 ) remarks that in this matter the usage of the country is to be followed. Vide Madanapārijāta pp. 394-395 also. 

Several rules are mentioned in the smrtis about the periods of asauca for the relatives of higher castes when they marry women of lower varnas (i. e. when there are anuloma marri ages). For example, Daksa VI. 12 says that if a brāhmaņa has married wives of the four varnas, then the impurity on the delivery or death of these women respectively lasts for 10, 6, 3 or 1 day. Visnu Dh. S. (22. 22-24) provides that when a ksatriya has sapiņdas of the vaisya or sūdra varna the āśauca on the birth and death of these lasts for six or three days, if a vaiśya has a sūdra as sapinda then impurity is removed after six days. But when people of lower varpas have sapindas of higher varnas then impurity on birth and death ceases when the impurity of the higher varņa sapindas ceases. Laghu-Hārīta 84 (= Āpastambasmrti IX verse 13) has similar provisions. Other smrtis and purāṇas like the Kūrma (Uttar ārdha 23. 30-36) mention differing views quoted in Hāralata pp. 54-60, Smr. M. pp. 495-496. The Madanapārijāta remarks (pp. 425-426 ) that some say that these varying provisions may be discarded or that they may be assigned their proper place according to the usages of the several countries or they should somehow be explained as based upon the person affected being possessed of virtues or not or they may be held to be appli cable to seasons of distress or otherwise. 

According to the Mit. on Yáj. 644 III, 22 persons belonging to the pratiloma castes have no periods of aśauca, but they have to observe rules of purification similar to those relating to answering the call of nature. Others like the Smrti-mukta phala 645 p. 495 aver, relying on Manu (X. 41), that the pratiloma castes are like südras and have to observe the āśauca prescribed for sūdras. The Hāralatā (p. 12 ) quotes Adipurāņa to the effect that varṇasankaras (i. o. pratilomas)

should follow the südras in the matter of aśauca and puri fication. The Smrtyartha-sāra (p. 92) states that those born of pratiloma unions should observe āśauca if they perform prāyaścitta, but if they do not perform prāyaścitta then there is no āśauca for them. 

It has already been stated (p. 215) how it was the duty of sapipdas to take out the corpse and to cremate it and how carry ing the dead body of a poor brāhmana was highly eulogised (Parāśara III. 39-40). But, as Manu V. 101-102 provide, if a brāhmana carried through affection the dead body of one 646 who was not his sapinda, as if he were a bandhu or carried (the dead body) of his mother's bandhus (such as mother's brother or sister) he became pure after three days; but if he partook of the food of those who were bereaved by death he became pure after ten days and if he does not stay in the house of those bereaved nor partakes of their food he becomes pure in a day (but if he stays in their house though not partaking of their food he has to observe aśauca for three days). Vide Kurmapurāṇa (Uttarardha 23.37) and Visnu 22. 7-9 also. Gautama (14.21-25) has rules on the same subject but they somewhat differ and Haradatta remarks that this āśauca is somewhat different from the āśauca observed by sapindas, viz. he becomes untouchable but he need not follow the other rules such as sleeping on the ground &c. If a person carried a dead body through greed (for money ), a brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya or sūdra had to observe āśauca respectively for 10, 12, or 15 days or a month. This was called nirhārāśauca, the word ‘nirhāra' 647 including the covering of the dead body with a garment, decking it with garlands, perfumes and ornaments, carrying it and cremating it. Sapiņdas who are observing āśauca for the death of the same person may dine in the same house and partake of the food cooked, but not others who are not undergoing the same āśauca. 648

Gaut. 14. 29, Manu V. 103, Yāj. III. 26, Parāšara III. 42 prescribe that a brāhmana should not follow the funeral pro cession of a deceased brāhmana, but if he does so, he has to bathe, touch fire, take in ghee and then he becomes pure. Parāśara III, 43-46 and Kūrmapurāpa (Uttarārdha 23.45) provide a rising scale of the days of āśauca if a brāhmaṇa follows the corpse of a ksatriya (āśauca for one day and pañcagavya), a vaiśya (āśauca for two days and six prāņāyāmas), a sūdra (āsauca for three days, bath in a river going to the sea, 100 prāņāyāmas 649 and drinking of ghee). Vide Trimsac-chloki Verse 13. 

If a brāhmaṇa who is not a sapinda of the deceased went to the bereaved family and wept along with the relatives before the collection of bones he had to observe āśauca for a day and then a bath if the deceased was a ksatriya or vaisya, but aśauca for three days if the deceased was a südra; but he had to undergo only a bath if he went after the collection of the bones; when the deceased was a sūdra and the weeping took place after the collection of bones he had to observe āśauca for a whole day and night. Vide Kūrmapurāṇa (Uttarārdha 23.46-47). Agnipurāṇa 158.47-48, Par, M. 1.2. pp. 283-285, Smr. M. (āśauca) p. 543 and Aśāucadaśaka verse 9 (for nirhāra, following a funeral procession and weeping ). 

Persons 650 undergoing an āśauca on birth or death for one person were forbidden to touch other persons undergoing aśauca for the birth or death of another person altogether. If they did so they had to perform prāyaścitta (Prājāpatya or Sāntapana). 

Even if a person's wife left him and lived in illicit relation ship with a person of the same or higher caste he had to observe on her death āśauca for one day. But if she lived with one lower in varna than her husband, the latter had not, on her death, to observe any āśauca at all (Yāj. III,6 ). Similarly. one had to observe one day's āśauca on the death of sons that were not qurasa (such as kṣetraja). Vide Yāj. III.25 and Visnu 22.42-43. 

Certain exceptions were recognized to the above rules about partaking of food at the house of one who is afflicted with

āšauca. While a marriage 651 rite (as also caula and upa nayana ), festival in honour of a deity and a sacrifice (like Jyotistoma ) are in progress, if impurity due to birth or death overtakes the performer, the materials (money and other things ) already set apart for them may be dedicated or donated to the deity or brāhmaṇas and no fault is incurred. As regards food, a smrti text 652 quoted by the Mit. says if in marriage, in a festival in honour of a deity or in a sacrifice āśauca on birth or death intervenes, the cooked food should be served through others (not affected by the āśauca) and the donor and the partaker of the food incur no blame. Acc. to Angiras, 653 Paithinasi (q. by Sm. C.) and Visnu Dh. S., when once a sacrifice (like a Somayāga), a marriage, a sacrifice or festival in honour of the mother Goddesses or a deity or the dedication or foundation of an idol or temple has been begun a supervening āśauca does not matter. Even in modern times this is followed as regards upanayana and marriage. When exactly a sacrifice or marriage ceremony may be said to have begun is laid down by Laghu-Visnu as follows: 654 in the case of a sacrifice it may be said to begin when the priests are chosen, in the case of vratas and japa when the sankalpa (declaration) is made, in the case of marriage when the Nândiśrāddha is performed, and in the case of a śrāddha when the food meant for the brāhmanas has been cooked completely. Certain things could be taken from the house of one who was undergoing asauca 655 on birth or death and who was the owner thereof (though not actually

from his hand, but with his permission). The Kūrmapurāṇa enumerates such articles. They are "fruits, flowers, raw vegetables, salt, firewood, butter-milk, curds, ghee, oil, drugs, milk and dry food' (like laddus, lājas ). Marici (q. by Mit. on Yaj. III. 17) and Trimsac-chloki verse 20 present oven longer lists of such things. 

Some smitis and commentators lay down rules about the aśauca to be observed by slaves when their masters are in āśauca. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 22.19, Devalasmộti verse 6, Bịhaspati quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 14.4. But as slavery has long been abolished this topic is passed over here. 

Ašaucasanni pāta or āśaucasam pāta (the knowledge of another āśauca coming to a person already observing one āśauca).656 The rules about this matter were promulgated early enough and they are based on convenience and common sense. The rules try to give relief to persons who may be sorely tried if it were held that, when another āśauca supervenes while a person is already in the midst of one, he has to finish all the days of the first āśauca and then begin the period of the second āśauca. The Gaut. Dh..S. 14.5 starts by saying that if another āśauca supervenes on one already being undergone, purification results after the remaining days of the first āsauca are over. Then sütras 6 and 7 provide that if the second aśauca supervenes in the last night of the first āśauca then purification results in two days after the first āśauca ends and if the second āśauca comes to be known in the last watch of the night of the last day of the first āśauca, the second ends in three days after the first ends. Baud. Dh. S. I. 5, 123 appears to be similar to Gaut. 14.5-6 Manu V. 79, Yāj. III. 20, Visnu Dh. S. 22. 35-38, Sankha 15. 10, Parāśara III. 28 lay down the general rule promulgated by Gautama 14.5. 

Some general rules concerning this topic may first be stated. The first rule is that in a conflict between āśauca on death and āśauca on birth, that on death is stronger.657 The

2nd rule is that if both āśaucas are of the same kind and the second is of the same duration or of lesser duration than the first then a man gets rid of both at the end of the first, but if the second, though of the same kind, has a longer duration than the first, then purification follows at the end of the one that is of longer duration. It has to be remembered that birth and death give rise to āśauca658 only when they are known by a person. 

On this topic there is a good deal of divergence between the views of the followers of the Mitakṣarā, of the Gaudas and Maithilas (vide Suddhiprakāsa pp. 74-82, Nirnayasindhu 536-540). Following the Nirnayasindhu it may be said that twelve alternatives are possible, when another āśauca supervenes on an already existing one. They are set out here. (1 & 2) If both āśaucas are due to birth and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the first āśauca there is purification from both (Visņu 22.35, Sankha 15.70); (3) If both āśaucas are due to birth and the second one is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Sankha 15.10, Şadašiti 19 ); ( 4 and 5) If both āśaucas arise on death and the second is of the same duration as the first or of lesser duration, then at the end of the period of the first aśauca there is purification from both; (6) If both asaucas arise on death and the second that intervenes is of longer duration than the first then purification results at the end of the second (Sadaśīti 21); (7, 8 and 9) When the firt āsauca is one arising from birth and an āśauca due to deaths intervenes, the āśauca on death must run its full course (i. e. there is no purification by the lapse of the first āśauca due to birth), whether the āśauca for death is of lesser duration than the āśauca on birth, or whether it is of the same or of longer

duration (Şadašiti 18); (10, 11) If the 659 first āśauca arises on death and the supervening one is due to birth and is of lesser duration than the one on death or of the same duration then both end at the expiration of the first āśauca on death (Sadasīti 21); (12) If the first āśauca arises on death and the super vening one arises on birth and is of longer duration, then both run their proper courses (Sadaśīti 21). 

The Dharmasindhu (p. 436) generally follows the Nirnaya sindhu but remarks: 'Asauca on death cannot be done away with by āśauca on birth which is of the same or greater dura tion; āśauca on death of the extent of pakṣini cannot get rid of āśauca on birth which is three or ten days in duration and āśauca on birth extending to ten days cannot be got rid of by āśauca on death which is of three days' duration. These are the views of many writers. A certain writer says that āśauca on birth though longer in duration can be got rid of by asauca on death which is of lesser extent. 

The Mit. on Yāj. III, 20 (first half) states an exception to the above rules about āśauca-sannipāta. When a person's mother dies and then, while the period of āśauca for the mother's death is not over, the father dies, it does not follow that the āsauca for the father comes to an end with the end of the āśauca for the mother, but the son has to observe the full period of 660 the asauca for father's death. Similarly, if the father died first and then, while the period of āśauca for the father was not over, the mother died, it does not follow that the āśauca for the mother's death comes to an end with the end of the first period of āśauca for the father, but the son after observing th 

er, but the son after observing the period of the father's āśauca has to observe āśauca for the mother for one paksini in addition. It may be remarked that Aparārka construes this verse differently by stating that if the father dies during the period of āśauca for the death of the mother, then the general rule applies, viz, that purification follows at the end of the asauca for the mother.

Special rules about āšauca 

*295 

If, while an āśauca on death is being undergone, an āsauca on birth arises, the father of the child born is able to perform the rites of Jātakarma and the like, because he is to be deemed to be purified for the nonce, according to Prajāpati.661 

___The Sadasiti (verse 22) provides 662 that the rule about purification on the expiry of the first āśauca in the case of succeeding āśaucas on birth or death has three exceptions, viz, a woman who is delivered of a child, the person who actually cremates the body (of the deceased) and the sons of the deceased; that is, a sütikā has to observe the proper period of untouch ability and one who cremates a dead body has to observe āśauca for ten days, though the delivery or cremation takes place in the midst of an āśauca on death. 

SA.DYAH-SA UCA. (purification on the same day). It has already been seen (p. 274) that Daksa (VI. 2) speaks of ten kinds of impurity on birth or death, the first two of which are sadyah śāuca and ekūha. Ekāha means day and night together (vide note 622 above). The ordinary meaning of 'sadyah' is 'at once, immediately.' But when Yaj. III. 29, Parāśara III. 10, Atri 97 and other smrtis employ the word 'sadyah-sauca' what is meant is that there is no āśauca for a whole day or three days or ten days, but only up to the taking of a bath or up to the end of the day or the end of the night on which the event occurs. Panini 663 mentions 'sadyah' and thirteen other words in one sutra as nipātas (irregularly formed). From Yāj. III. 23 (ādantajanmanaḥ sadya ücüdānnaišjki smrtā) it impliedly follows that sadyah has the meaning of a part of a day or a part of the night' (as the case may be) and 'naisiki' means a whole day and night (as note 622 shows). The Suddhitattva

(pp. 340-341 ) explains 664 sadyaḥ' as meaning a portion of the day or of the night and cites several authorities in support. The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 92) explains that'sadyaḥsauca' in some contexts means 'absence of āśauca,' while in others it means 

bath' and with reference to those killed in battle and the like (to whom pindas have to be offered) it means a part of the day or of the night.' The Sortimuktāphala 665 (āśaucakanda ) p.481 says that'sadyahsauca' means 'impurity that comes to an end by a bath.' That pindas have to be offered to those about whom there is 'sadyahśauca' is stated by the Adipurāṇa.666 According to the Suddhikaumudi (p.73) *sadyaḥšauca' has two meanings, viz. (1) the entire absence of āśauca as in the cases of sacrificial priests &c. (Yāj. III. 28), (2) āśauca that is removed by a mere bath ( as in Manu V. 76). 

The rules about āśauca for several days do not operate in five classes of cases, viz. certain persons are exempted altogether, certain activities of certain persons who would ordinarily be untouchable owing to āśauca are allowed without causing pollu tion, certain articles can be taken by anybody without fear of pollution from those who are affected by āśauca, no asauca is to be observed for certain deceased persons owing to their faults, in the case of certain persons express texts say that no āśauca need be observed for them. These five classes will briefly be dealt with in order. In the principal texts these five classes of cases are rather mixed up. In the Viṣnupurāņa III, 13.7 it is provided that there is sadyaḥsauca on the death of a child, or of a person dying in another country, of a patita, or of an ascetic or on the death of a person committing suicide by water, fire or hanging. Vide also Gaut. 14.11 and 42 and Vāmanapurāṇa 14.99.

Cases of sadyah-śauca 

297 Yāj. (III. 28-29 ) prescribes that there is sadyahšauca (purification after a bath ) in case of birth or death of a sapiņda ) for priests chosen for a sacrifice (after they are offered Madhuparka ), for those who have undergone dikṣā for a vedic sacrifice (like Somayāga) and those who are engaged in performing the constituent parts of a Vedic sacrifice, those who continuously distribute food at a charity house, those who are engaged in prāyascittas like cāndrāyana or the vows of snātakas, for brahmacārins (when performing the duties of their āśrama ), for persons who everyday make gifts of a cow, gold etc. (at the time of making the gift), for those who have realized Brahman (ascetics); there is sadyahsauca at gifts ( when once begun), at marriage, in a Vedic sacrifice, in battle (for those who are about to be engaged in it), when there is commotion in a country (through invasion ), and in a severe calamity (like famine when one can accept food from any body). Gaut. (14, 43-44) says that there is sadyahsauca in the case of kings as otherwise there will be obstacles in their duties and also in the case of brāhmanas in order to prevent the cessation of their duties of teaching. Sankhalikhita say the same Raja dharmāyatanam sarveṣām tasmādanavaruddhaḥ pretaprasa vadoṣaih ' (Suddhikalpataru p. 62). It is stated in Manu V. 93 that kings, 667 those engaged in vratas and sattras (like Gavām-ayana ) are not liable to undergo the blemish of āśauca, because they (kings ) occupy the position of Indra (ruler) and are like Brahma (which is free from all taint) and Manu V. 94 clinches the matter further by observing 

sadyaḥśauca is ordained for the position of a king which can be obtained only by great merit (in past lives) for the sake of the protection of the subjects and the reason of this (rule) is the position that he occupies.' Similarly, Gobhilasmrti 668 

667. न राज्ञामघदोषोस्ति वतिनां न च सत्रिणाम् । ऐन्द्र स्थानमुपासीना ब्रह्मभूता हि ते सदा॥ राज्ञो माहात्मिके स्थाने सद्यःशौचं विधीयते । प्रजानां परिरक्षार्थमासनं चात्र कारणम्॥ HE V. 93-94. The first verse is the same as Vasistha 19.48 (Furher's text is corrupt, which must be corrected into arm a) which cites it as Yama's. It is the position that he holds that renders the king (whether a ksatriya brahmana or sudra) free from āsauca. The facuATT (22.47-52) restricts the absence of asauca by saying 'kings are free from āsauca when they are berek forming the duties of a king (such as administration of justice)': ' THEN राजकमाणन बातेनां व्रते न सत्रिणां सत्रे न कारूणां स्वकर्माण न राजाज्ञाकारिणां तदिच्यानल

(III. 64-65, often quoted as Chandogaparisista of Katyāyana ) states in a sūtaka, a brahmacārin should not give up his peculiar duties (Veda study and vratas), a sacrificer his various actions ( required ) in a sacrifice after he has undergone dikṣā, one who is practising penance should not give up krcchra and the like; these do not incur impurity even on the death of their father (or mother )'. The Kūrmapurāṇa 669 provides 'no impurity is declared on death in the case of perpetual or temporary brahmacārins, forest hermits or ascetics'. Similar rules are given by Atri 97-98, Linga-purāṇa, pūrvabhāga, chap. 89.77. The Mit. on Yāj. III, 28 remarks that in the case of the three asramas of brahmacārin, vānaprastha and yati there is freedom from impurity in all cases and at all times; ascetics and brahmacārins have to undergo a bath with clothes on the death of their father or mother (Dharmasindhu p. 442); in the case of several others such as those who are continually making gifts or are observing vratas there is freedom from impurity only when they are engaged in those particular actions and not when they are engaged in any action whatever or when they mix up among others for everyday work. 670 Similar rules occur in Parāśara III, 21-22. It has already been stated follow ing Manu V. 91 ( = Visnu 22.86 ) that a brahmacārin was not to perform the last rites (of carrying the corpse, crenation) for anybody except for five persons (viz. his parents, upadhyāya, ācārya and guru). He did not incur āśauca by performing the funeral rites of his parents and offering water and pinda to them. But if he did so for any one other than the five mentioned by Manu he had to observe āśauca for ten days, and to undergo prāyaścitta and had his upanayana performed again. A brahma cārin had to observe after samāvartana (returning from the Vedic teacher) āśauca for three days for all relatives that died during the period of his studenthood (Manu V. 88, Visnu Dh. S. 22.87). Gautama (14. 42-44) says generally671 that on the death of child

ren (before the appearance of teeth or before Cūda), of thoge who are separated by a country, of ascetics and of those who are not sapindas, the relatives are purified by only a bath; 80 also there is sadyahsauca for kings, for otherwise there would be conflict with their duty of protecting the subjects) and for a brāhmana also in order that there may be no cessation of Vedic study.672 The Suddhiprakāśa (p. 93) remarks that though there is no āśauca ( as stated by Yāj. III. 28 ) yet a sacrificial priest and a diksita had to bathe on the death of a sapiņda, a brahmacarin also would have to take a bath if he followed the funeral procession of his father or mother &c., but an ascetic would not have even to bathe and that usage was the same in 

its day. 

The second class of exceptions refers to cases where certain persons, though they have incurred āśauca, are allowed to do certain acts or carry on their activities without bringing pollu tion to those with whom they deal or come in contact. For example, Parāśara (III. 20-21) says; 'craftsmen (such as those who draw pictures or washermen), workers (cooks and the like), physicians, male and female slaves, barbers, kings and śrotriyas are declared to be sadyahsauca, as also one observing a vrata (cândrāyana &c.), one purified by being engaged in a sattra (such as Gavām-ayana), a brāhmaṇa who has established srauta fires; the king has not to observe āśauca and also any one (such as his purohita) whom the king for his own purpose desires not to observe it.' The Adipurāp a673 gives the reason why craftsmen, physicians and others were allowed not to observe āśauca when engaged in their paculiar tasks, viz. what these people do cannot be done by any one else at all or at least so well or so easily.

It has 674 to be noted that the absence of āśausa in the case of craftsmen, physicians and the like has to be restricted to the peculiar activities of these and does not extend to all actions such as religious rites, śrāddhas and gifts. This is clear from the words of the Vispudharmasutra 675 22. 48-52. The Trimsacchjoki (verse 18) 696 gives a long list of such peculiar activities. The Kūrmapurāņa (Uttarārdha 23. 57-64) has nine verses on this topic which are quoted by the Hāralatā (p. 114). 

It has already been seen (pp. 238–240) that Pār. gr. III. 10 (nityāni vinivartante vaitānavarjam), Manu. V. 84, Yaj. III. 17 (latter half) provide that even those who have to undergo āśauca on death should not stop rites to be performed with śrauta fires, but should perform them themselves or get them performed through others. Thus certain religious rites were allowed to be done even by those who were āśaucin. 

The Dharmasindhu (p. 552) emphasizes that this exception to aśauca should be availed of only when there is no other alternative or in a season of distress. 

It has already been stated how certain materials and things can be received without any pollution from those who are undergoing āśauca. That is the third class of cases which are exceptions to the rules of āśauca. 

The fourth class of cases where rules of asauca do not apply relate to persons deceased to whom some fault or taint attaches, Gaut. (14, 11) 677 and Sankha-Likhita provide that there is sadyahấauca for those who kill themselves (i. e. commit suicide) by starting on the great journey (to the Himālaya), by fasting, by a weapon (like a dagger), by fire or poison or water or by hanging or by falling down from a precipice.

GU? Yaj. III. 6 provides 678 that women that have gone over to heterodox views and practices, that do not belong to any particular āśrama, that are thieves (of gold and the like), that (attempt to kill their husbands, that are unchaste and the like, that drink liquor and that attempt suicide, do not deserve to have water offered to them (on death) and no āśauca should be observed for them. This verse applies to men also as far as possible. Manu V. 89-90 are to the same effect. The Kūrmapurāṇa algo prescribes 679 that for him who kills himself by means of fire, poison and the like, no asauca, no cremation and no offering of water is prescribed, there is no cremation for patitas, nor antyesti nor collection of bones, no shedding of tears and no pinda and no śrāddha should be per formed for them. It is provided by Angiras quoted by Mit. on Yāj. III. 6 that 'death results to evil-minded men from cāndalas (with whom a quarrel is purposely got up), from water, from a snake, from a brāhmana, from lightning and from animals that have sharp fangs (like tigers). If water and pinda are offered to such people (who die wilfully in these cases) they (water and pinda) do not reach them and perish in mid air.' These verses refer to death in a wrathful fight with tigers, snakes and the like or suicide in water through wrath or sorrow. But, if one died in water or by fire through inadvertence or negligence, then Angiras 680 himself provides that water should be offered and aśauca should be observed. Long passages are quoted from the Brahmapurāṇa by Haradatta on Gaut. 14. 11, Suddhiprakāśa pp. 56-57, Nirnayasindhu p. 550, which elabo rate the same ideas as those of Yaj.

· If an āhitāgni were killed by cāndālas in defiant fight with them or commits suicide, his corpse should be got cremated by sūdras without proper mantras and Gobhilasmrti (III. 49-51) provides for the disposal of his srauta fires and sacrificial implements. Though suicide was generally condemned, the smptis (such as Atri 218-219) and Purānas allowed certain exceptions, viz. very old men (above 70), very weak men who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or those who have no desire left for the pleasures of the senses or who have carried out all tasks and duties, may start on Mahāprasthāna or die at Prayāga. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 926-928 for detailed treatment of this topic. If a man killed himself in the way allowed by the śāstra then there was no blemish and asauca had to be observed and water and srāddha had to be offered. It may be noted that starting on Mahāprasthāna and suicide on the part of old men by falling down from a precipice or in fire are forbidden in the Kali age. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III p. 939 and pp. 958-959. 

The Mit, on Yāj. III. 6 quotes Vrddha-Yājñavalkya and Chāgaleya to the effect that in the case of those who commit suicide in any manner that is not sanctioned by the śāstras, Nārāyapabali should be performed one year after their death and then the rites of śrāddha inay be performed thereafter, The Mit, 681 on Yāj. 1II. 6) relying on Viṣnupurāṇa describes the Nārāyanabali as follows: On the 11th day of the bright half of a month, having worshipped Visņu and Yama, one should with the face to the south offer near them on darbhas with ends turned towards the south ten pindas laved with honey and ghee and mixed with sesame after bringing to mind the deceased 682 who should be looked upon as having the form of Visnu and having uttered the name and gotra of the deceased; he should honour the pindas with sandalwood paste and the rest and having performed all the rites up to the removal of pipdas, should cast them in a river and not give them to the

wife or to others. Then on the night of the same day he should invite an uneven number of brāhmanas, shou]d observe a fast, should worship Visnu the next day, in the noon he should per form all the rites from washing the feet of brāhmaṇas up to the query about the gratification of the brāhmanas (by the food served to them) according to the procedure of ekoddista śrāddha, then he should silently go through all the rites from ullekhana (drawing lines) up to avanejana (anointing) by the procedure of Pinda-pitryajña. He should offer four pindas to (images of) Visnu, Brahmā, Siva and Yama together with the attendants, should remember the deceased by name and gotra, should utter the name of Visnu and then offer the 5th pinda, Then having gratified the brāhmaṇas (after they have sipped water) with fee, he should bring to his mind one of the brāh manas) that is the most qualified of all as representing the deceased and having gratified him to the utmost with the gifts of cows, land and money, should then make the brāh maņas that have pavitras on their hands offer to the deceased water together with sesame and should then take his meal along with his relatives. 

The passage quoted by the Mit, makes it clear that Nārā yanabali is meant only for those who commit suicide and is to be offered one year after the death of the person guilty of suicide. The Hāralatā 683 (p. 212) also says the same and explains a verse of Vispu extending the performance of Nārā yanabali to those killed by cows and brāhmaṇas and those who become patita as a usage restricted to a certain country 

only. 684 

The Antyestipaddhati of Nārāyaṇabhatta describes (on folio 187) Nārāyanabali rite at greater length than in the Mitākṣarā. One or two details may be pointed out. Five kalaśas (jars) are to be placed over a quantity of rice or yavas, then filled with water, then have the three mantras "Apo hi ṣtha'

(Rg. X 9.1-3) repeated over them, then copper plates are to be placed over them on which five images of Brahmā, Viṣnu," Śiva, Yama and the deceased are to be drawn and the worship of these five is to be performed respectively with the Puruṣa sūkta (Rg. X. 90), Rg. X. 121. 1-10, Rg. I. 43. 1 (= Tai. A. X, 17), Rg X, 14.13 and the name and gotra of the deceased, sixteen oblations of cooked rice are to be offered to Nārāyana with the sixteen verses of the Purusasūkta (Rg. X. 90). Ten piņdas 685 are to be offered on darbhas to the deceased after repeating his name and gotra (as atated in the note below). After the ten pindas are cast in a river, there is tarpana of the deceased sixteen times with the sixteen stanzas of the Purusa sūkta. Then bali is offered separately to Viṣnu, Brahmā, Siva and Yama with his servants. 

In the Mitāksarā, there is no homa nor bali, both of which are described in the Antyestipaddhati and the Smrtyarthasara (pp. 85-86 ) copies verbatim the procedure given in the Mit. Bphatparāśara (V. pp. 175-176) contains the same procedure that is set out by the Mit. from the Visnupurāņa. The Nirnaya sindhu first describes Nārāyanabali as gathered from Hemādri and the Garudapurāņa (III. 4. 113–119). It then describes Nārāyaṇabali to be performed for a deceased ascetic on the 12th day (along with Pārvanaśrāddha), following the procedure laid down by Baudhāyana. It then describes another form of Nārāyaṇabali based on Saunaka which is meant for all those who commit suicide or who are killed by cāndālas, 686 snakes, lightning, animals with fangs or who die in a distant land or for ascetics and yogins. The Vrddha-Hāritasmrti (IX. 123-143) describes another method of Nārāyanabali for devotees of Viṣnu. 

The Vaikhānasa-smārtasūtra (X. 9) sets out a rather brief procedure of Nārāyanabali which was intended for the benefit of men who committed suicide or were slain and for ascetics and provides that the same may be performed for those guilty of mahāpātakas after twelve years from their death. The

Baudhāyana-grhya-śesasūtra III. 20 and 21 contain two different sets of the procedure of Nārāyanabali, the latter of which appears to be the later one. The latter contains the well-known Verse about death at the hands of candālas, from a snake &c. 

The 5th class of exceptions to aśauca rules comprises those that are declared by express texts as not liable to observe an aśauca. Gautama (14. 8-10) provideg 687 that the sapindas ) of those that met death for the sake of cows and brāhmanas, of those that met death through the wrath of the king and those that were killed in battle have to observe no āśauca but only *sadyahšauca'. Manu V. 95 and 98 state 688 that (the sapindas) of those that are killed in a sudden affray or by lightning or by the king (for an offence) or of those that met death in protect ing cows and brāhmaṇas and of one who was killed in the fashion of ksatriyas in a battle by the sword have to observe no ašauca, as also he whom the king desires (for his purpose) to observe no āśauca. It is provided by Śatātapa 689 that as regards a yati dying, his sons and other sapindas are not to offer water or pinda to him or to observe āśauca for him. The Dharmasindhu (p. 449) says that this applies to all ascetics, whether they be tridandin orekadandin, hařsas or parama hansas. So also on the death of a vānaprastha there is no āśauca. In the case of one who has performed his own sraddha while alive his gapindas have an option either to observe asauca or not. On the death of a brahmacārin āśauca is to be observed. The Dharmasindhu further notes that in all works it is stated that there is no āśauca 690 for one killed in battle, but at least

[Vol. 

among brāhmaṇas (i. e, as to brāhmanas killed in battle) the usage of the sistas is different (i. e, asauca is observed). 

Parāśara (III. 12-13) provides that, if a man has gone for many years to a distant land and it is ascertained that he died there but the exact date of his death is not known, then either of three tithis viz. the 8th or 11th day of the dark half or the amāvāsyā should be accepted as the day of his death and water, pipda and śrāddha should be offered on that date and the Par. M.I.2 p. 237 adds that āśauca also must be calculated from that date. On the other hand Laghu-Harita says that if there is some obstacle at the time of a grāddha or when the date of death is not known, then the funeral rites should be performed on the 11th tithi of the following dark half (Suddhikaumudi p. 17). 

The digests lay particular emphasis on the fact that in matters of aśauca the usages of a country must be observed. The Haralatā (pp. 55, 205) quotes passages from the Adipurāṇa where special reference is made to the authority of the usages of a country (dega-dharmapramānatvāt). The Suddhitattva p. 275 quotes691 a verse of Marici 'one should not disregard the manner of observing sauca and religious usages that are current in particular localities; the dharma is of that sort alone in those localities'. On p. 276 it quotes a passage of the Vāmanapurāṇa to the same effect. 

It deserves to be noted that Daksa 692 (VI. 15) states that all rules about āśauca apply when the times are easy and peaceful but when a man is overwhelmed by distress there is no (enforcement or application) of the (rules of) āśauca. 

Viṣnu (19. 18-19) provides 693 that at the end of the period of aśauca one should go out of the village, get himself shaved and take a bath after applying a thick paste of sesame or white mustard to the body, change garments and then re-enter the house. Then he should perform a sānti (propitiatory rite)

and honour brahmanas. Many medieval digests provide for a more elaborate procedure. For example, the Suddhikaumudi (pp. 155-164) sets out the procedure of the 11th day separately for the followers of the three Vedas. A few salient points may be mentioned. After a bath for the whole body, the sapiņdas should touch a cow, gold, fire, dūrvā, clarified butter and repeat the name of Govinda, then engage brāhmanas to sprinkle śānti water over them and say 'svasti'. If a brāh mana cannot be had one should himself perform santi. The Hāralatā and others say that without sānti water āśauca is not completely removed. The followers of Sāmaveda should sing the Vámadevagāna for sānti or should repeat the four Vāmadevya verses viz. 'kayā nascitra,' 'kastvā satyo,' "abhi ṣü nah' (No. 682-684 of the Samaveda) together with the last verse of the Sāmaveda 'svasti na Indro') preceded and followed by the sacred Gayatri; these form the śānti mantras for Samavedins. For followers of Yajurveda seventeen mantras beginning with ‘rcam vācam prapadye' and ending with 'dyauh śāntih', preceded and followed by the Gāyatri form the sānti mantras; the Rgveding should employ for santi Rg. X. 9. 4, VII, 35, 1, V. 47. 7 &c. preceded and followed by the Gāyatri. Then some gold with silver as daksinā should be donated to a brāhmana, then the Vaitarani cow should be donated, if one was not given at the approach of death, then a gift of the bedstead &c. should be made. 

We have seen (p. 270) that originally the sūtras (like Sān. Sr.) and smrtis (like Manu) emphasized that one should not increase the number of the days of āśauca and that men learned in the Veda and consecrating srauta fires had to undergo only one day's āśauca (Parāśara III. 5, Daksa VI. 6). But ultimately a filat period of ten days of aģauca (Manu V.59) for all sapindas came to be prescribed. In the old days the means of communi cation were very limited, and hence the news of a birth or death must have taken considerable time to reach relatives staying even at a short distance and hence the restrictions imposed by the rules of āśauca were not felt to be very irksome. It is on account of this reason and also the great penchant of dharma śāstra writers for all sorts of divisions, sub-divisions and Classifications that we find medieval writers bestowinglan enbr mously exaggerated attention in very exuberant and enthusias. tio style on such a subject as āśauca. Most nations have their own usages to indicate that a person (male or female) orca family is in mourning. But probably no country in threshworld

can equal (much less surpass) the Dharmaśāstra writers in the elaborate rules evolved in books about āśauca on birth and death. In these days when there is a State postal system and the means of communication abound owing to railways, air mail, telegraph and wireless, the ancient and medieval rules of āśauca are felt by all people to be most galling and trouble some, Mischievous people sometimes create trouble in the cele bration of marriages by sending information about a death or a birth to persons against whom they have a grudge, Devices have to be employed for dodging the inconvenience due to rules of āśauca. It is therefore necessary to introduce substantial changes in the rules about āśauca that will prevent trouble, loss of time and work and would at the same time be more or less in agreement with the spirit of the dicta of the smrtis and the sentiments of most common people. At the end in the appendix note 693a is added which gives the text of the Agauca-dasaka with Sanskrit explanation. 

As regards āśauca on birth I would recommend that here after in the changed set-up of society in these days one simple rule should be observed, viz. it is only the mother that has to observe impurity for ten days and no one else has to observe impurity on birth. This is in general accordance with the ancient smptis set out above, 

As regards impurity on death four rules should ordinarily suffice.6934 

(1) Asauca for ten days on death should be observed by the father and the mother for the son and by the son for the parents, by the wife for the husband and vice versa and by one who performs the rites of cremation and the rites after death. 

(2) For others (than the above) staying near the deceased as members of a joint family āśauca for only three days should suffice. 

(3) For all other relatives of the deceased whenever the news of death may reach them within a year after death, only a bath should be enough. 

(4) When the death occurred more than a year before the news reached the relatives not even a bath should be se required in the case of any relative except those mentioned in ob the first rule, who should be held clean after a bath,

Most important tabus 

309 

Practices observed among ancient and modern primitive tribes show that the most important tabus were those on the dead, on women in child-birth and women in their monthly illness. Among the ancient Israelites all that were unclean through the dead were put outside the camp and they were not allowed to offer an offering at the Passover (Numbers V.1-4 and IX, 6). Among the Syrians those who belonged to the family of the dead man were tabu for 30 days and could then enter only with shaven heads. Child-birth made a woman unclean and the number of days that she was to be unclean depended on whether the child was a male or a female (Leviticus 12. 2-5). In India also the ancient Aryans probably inherited their ideas about uncleanness on death and child-birth from their remote ancestors. If one may surmise one can say this: it must have been found out by the remote ancestors of the Vedic Aryans that if a person touched a dead body or used the clothes worn by the dead man when living, he also suffered from the same disease (particularly in the case of contagious diseases like plague, cholera, typhoid &c.) and that segregating such a person for ten days from other members of the tribe or community made the latter immune from the attack of such diseases. Therefore, those who touched the dead or carried the corpse for cremation or burial and the members of the family were thought to be unclean and were segregated for ten days. Gradually the ideas about the uncleanness on death and the necessity of segregation were made applicable to death due to all diseases or causes whatever. The uncleanness on child birth might have been a case of extension by analogy derived from the tabu on death. At all events smrti writers put both on the same level (e. g. Manu V. 61 "Just as impurity on death is ordained for ten days in the case of sapindas the same holds good in the case of birth"). Rules about women in their monthly illness were prescribed as early as the Tai.S. and have been already dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 802-805. 

We have now to turn to the subject of suddhi apart from asauca. Suddhi of a dravya means the 694 removal of a taint attaching to a thing and it is of two kinds, purification of the body and the purification of an external object (Manu 110 and Aparārka p. 253). It has already been seen (note 555

above) how even the Rg. lays great emphasis on suddhi and being pure (suci). There are Vedic 695 passages laying down that the cups (grahas ) used in Jyotiṣtoma and other sacrifices were to be cleansed with a strainer of wool, but not the camasas. In the Ait. Br. 32.4 it is provided that if the milk of an agnihotrin that was heated by him for the homa became impure (amedhya, by an ant or worm falling therein ), the milk is to be taken up in an agnihotrahavani and was to be poured upon the ashes near the Ahavaniya fire. This shows that great care was taken about the purity of vessels to be used in sacrifices and about the offerings to be made. sauca is one of the eight qualities of the soul (atmagunas) mentioned by Gaut. 8.24, Atri (verses 33, 35), Matsyapurāṇa 52. 8-10, Brhaspati (q. by Aparārka p. 164). Haradatta on Gautama quotes a verse that śauca is of four kinds viz. monetary purity, mental purity, bodily purity and purity in speech; while Atri and Brhaspati696 (q. by Aparārka p. 164), aver that sauca is constituted by avoiding what ought not to be eaten, by associating (only) with those who are not censured (i. e. are not reprehensible ) and by firmly abiding by one's own prescribed duties. Many works divide sauca into two varieties viz. bāhya (external) and antara or ābhyantara (internal). Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 651-52 for passages from Baudhāyana Dh. S. (I. 5. 3-4), Harita, Dakṣa and others defining and subdividing these. Agni 372. (17-18) is the same as Daksa V.3. The Vanaparva 200.52 speaks of purity in speech, in actions and that brought about by water, The Padma (II. 66. 86-87) emphasizes that it is the mental attitude that is the highest thing and illustrates it by saying that a woman embraces her son and her husband with different mental states. There is an interesting passage in the Lingapurāņa 8. 34-36 (not quoted there) which after stating that ābhyantara sauca is superior to bāhya sauca (verse 31) remarks 697 that one void of inner purity is dirty even after a

Importance of mental purity

Manu V. 106 provides that of all kinds of purity mental purity is the highest. He who is pure as to wealth (i. e. who does not deprive another of wealth by unjust means) is the (only) pure man and not he who is purified by water and earth. Visnu 22. 89 is the same except that for wealth (artha) it substitutes food (anna ). The Trikāndamandana (prakirpaka 21) has the same verse as Manu V. 106. Vide also Anušāsana 108, 12 (for purity of conduct, of mind, of a holy place, purity due to correct philosophical knowledge ); Brahmānda III. 14. 60 (sucikāmā hi devā vai), and Yogasūtra II, 32 (for sauca as one of the five niyamag). 

External purity of the body by various means (rinsing the mouth, bath & c.) has already been described in detail in H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 648-668. The ancient and medieval Indians insisted on a daily bath for all, recommended two baths day in certain cases and three baths to a hermit and did not subs cribe to the view of some of the early Christians. St. Agnes was canonized primarily for her refusal to bathe and St. Francis of Assisi considered dirt as one of the proper insignia of holy poverty. 698 

In srauta rites ( such as Agnistoma ) the sacrificer had to undergo a severe discipline of consecration (or dikṣā), one item of which was the purification of the intending sacrificer's body by the adhvaryu priest by rubbing the former's body twice with three bunches of seven darbhas each (vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 1136). Śatātapa q. by Sm. C. I. p. 120, Suddhiprakāśa p. 147 provide bath for one who has sexual intercourse with his wife during the period from the 5th to the 16th day after monthly illness begins, but for intercourse after these days the purifica tion is the same as for urination and voiding ordure ; bath is also prescribed for vomiting after sunrise, after shaving, after a bad dream, on the touch of foul men (such as cândālas.com

1 Vol. The Ap. Śr. II. 12 provides 699 that Pavitreṣti should be performed by him who is desirous of suddhi and that if one performs in each season the three iṣtis, viz. Vaisvānarī (to Agni Vaišvānara), Vrātapati (to Agni Vratapati) and the Pavitresti one purifies ten generations (of his family ). 

The following pages will deal with the purification of things (dravyasuddhi ). But a few general observations must first be made. The Āp. Dh, S. (II. 6. 15. 17-20) states that infants do not become polluted or impure (by the touch of a woman in her monthly course) up to the time the samskāra of annaprā sana (taking cooked food for the first time ), that, according to some, up to one year or as long as they cannot distinguish between the different directions or up to the time of Upanayana according to others. Manu V. 127-133, Yaj. I. 186, 191-193, Visnu Dh. S. 23. 47-52, Baud, Dh. I. 5. 56-57, 64, 65, Sankha 16. 12-16, Mārkandeya-purāṇa 35. 19-21 state that the following are always pure: --what is not seen to be polluted; what is cleansed with water; what is commended expressly (by a brāhmaṇa as pure, when there is a doubt), water collected on (pure) ground that is not visibly polluted by an impure thing and that in quantity is so much that a cow can slake its thirst therein and that has the smell, colour and taste of pure water ); the hand of a craftsman (such as a washerman or a cook while engaged in his peculiar work); articles exposed for sale in a market such as rice and barley (though touched by many intending buyers); alms (collected by a brahmacūrin though walking from house to house on the road); the mouth of a woman (at the time of dalliance); meat of animals seized or killed even by dogs, capdālas, and carnivorous birds; rays (of the sun), fire, dust, the shadow (of a tree or the like), a cow, a horse, land, wind, dew drops, flies, a calf at the time of making the cow flow with milk from the udder-these latter are pure when they come in contact with a person. Then it was said that certain birds and animals were either always pure or as to certain parts of the body e. g. Yāj. I. 194 says that the mouths of goats and horses are pure but not of the cow. Baudhāyana 700 quoted by Aparārka p. 276 provides that

the cow is pure except as to its mouth, and a cat when it is leaping or moving about. Brhaspati 701 and Yama (q. by Aparārka p. 276) state: 'the feet of brāhmanas, and the mouth of goats and horses, the backs of cows and all limbs of women are pure; the cow as to its back, the elephant as to its shoulder, the horse as to all its limbs and the dung and urine of cows, all these are pure'. Atri (240, 241) contains several verses 702 on this point. Things taken out from a mine or from kit chens (or places where grain is pounded &c.) are never impure, since all such places (where anything is prepared in the mass ) except a place for the manufacture of liquor are pure. All fried (or roasted) things, fried barley and grain, dates, camphor, whatever else is well fried is pure!. In Atri V. 13 we read 703 'flies, a continuous stream (of any liquid), the earth, water, fire, a cat, a wooden ladle and a mongoose are always pure'. Parāśara (X. 41) states: 794 "space (ākāsa), wind, fire, water fallen on the earth, darbhas are not to be deemed polluted just as camasas in sacrifices are held to be not polluted.' Par. M. quotes a verse of Caturvimsatimata 705 that raw meat, ghee, honey, oils extracted from fruits-these even when contained in vessels belonging to candālas become free from taint the moment they are taken out of these vessels.

out from crushing machines, actions (such as cooking) done by women and children when they are impure (by walking barefooted on the road) and are seen to be so, are still free from taint. One's 707 own bed, garment, wife, child, water pot these are free from taint for oneself, but these are impure to others. Sankha 16.15 is to the same effect. 

Sankha 708 states that whatever removes the dirt (or pollu tion) that is natural to a substance or arises from contact with another polluting substance must be declared to be its purifier. Sankha-Likhita 709 declare that the substances that bring about purification of all (polluted things) are water, clay, the powder (or paste) of soap berries, bilva fruit, rice and mustard cake, salts (ashes), cow's urine and dung and that according to some when a substance is heaped up in a big mass, sprinkling with water. Manu V. 118, Yāj. I. 184, Viṣnu Dh. S. 23.13 also provide that sprinkling with water is the mode of purification when large quantities of corn or clothes are pollu ted, but when the quantity is small they must be washed with water. The quantity is said to be large when it is more than what one man can carry as a load (according to Kullūka on Manu V. 118). 

The general rule laid down by Gaut. I. 45–46, Manu V. 126 ( Viṣnu 23, 39), Yāj. I. 191 about the purification of things or bodies that are smeared with foul matter is that water and earth are to be employed for purification till the foul odour and the contact of the foul thing is entirely removed 710. Devala (q. by Aparārka p. 270) defines sauca as the removal by means of clay, water, cowdung and the like of the besmearing, the oiliness and odour of a thing that cause impurity.

Purification of things 

315 

in Gaut. Dh. S. (I. 28-33 ) briefly deals 710a with the purification of things as follows: Purification of metallic substances (like bell-metal), earthenware, substances manufactured from wood, cloth made of threads or yarn is brought about respectively by rubbing (or scouring) them, by baking in fire, by chiselling or planing, by washing in water; objects made of stones, jewels, shells and pearls are purified by the same means as metallio substances; bones (ivory and the like) and mud (floor of houses) are purified in the same way as wooden substances; and earth (when polluted) is also purified by adding to it earth (brought from another pure spot); ropes, chips of bamboos and reeds, leather are purified by the same means as cloth or they may be abandoned when they are extremely polluted (as by the spilling of wine or urine or ordure). Vas. (III. 49–53) has almost the same words, employing the word 'bhasmaparimārjana' (scour ing with ashes and washing ) for 'parimārjana'. The Āp. Dh. S. (I. 5. 17. 10–13) 711 provides: 'If one gets a used vessel only, he shall eat from it after having heated it thoroughly; a vessel made of metal is purified by being scoured with ashes and the like; a wooden vessel becomes pure by being scraped; at a sacrifice, vessels must be cleaned according to the precepts of the Veda.' Yaj. (III. 31-34) states; time (lapse of ten days or a year as to āśauca), fire, religious rites (like Aśvamedha or performing of sandhyā), clay, wind, mind, spiritual knowledge, austerities (such as krochra), water, repentance (in the case of sins), fasting--all these are the causes of purification Gifts are the (main) cause of purification for those who do what is forbidden, flow of water in the case of a river, clay and water are means of suddhi in the case of substances that are not clean, sannyāsa (order of asceticism) in the case of the twice-born, austerities in the case of those that have studied the Veda when they commit a sin (through ignorance), forbearance in the case of those who know the Self, water in the case of dirty limbs, silent recital of Vedic mantras ( japa) is the means of purifica

tion for those guilty of secret sins, truth in the case of the mind (that is full of or is polluted by sinful thoughts), austerities and esoteric knowledge in the case of the man who identifies his soul with the body, correct knowledge in the case of intelligence, knowledge of God is the pre-eminent purifier of the soul. Manu V. 107-109 (= Vispu 22.90-92 ) contain almost the same idea in almost the same words. 

In prescribing the methods of cleaning polluted objects certain matters have to be considered according to a verse ascribed to Baudhāyana 712 by the Mit. (on Yāj. I. 190) which states: 'One should prescribe means of purification after con sidering the time, the place, the body (or himself), the thing (to be purified), the purpose for which the thing is to be used, origin (of defilement), the condition (of the thing or person defiled).' 

There is some divergence of views about the means of puri fying or cleansing certain objects. It is unnecessary to set out in detail these differences. It is proposed to take certain objects one after another and to specify how they were rendered pure according to several of the smrtis and digests. 

Certain foul things were said by the Smrtyarthasāra p. 70 to be the causes of extreme pollution and certain others as causes of lesser or insignificant pollution. For example, excreta, urine, semen, blood,: fat, marrow, liquor and intoxicants were the causes of great pollution; while dogs, village swine, cats, their urine, the wax from the ear, nails, phlegm, discharge from the eyes, perspiration are the causes of insignificant pollution. 

Baud. Dh. S, I. 5,66 provides 713 that the purification of the ground is brought about by means of sweeping with a (fault less) broom, by sprinkling (cow's milk, urine or water), by smearing with cowdung, by scattering (pure clay on it) and by scrubbing away (or scraping) some of the soil, when these are employed according to the situation of the ground and the particular impurity (of which it is to be purified).

Purification of the ground or soil 

317 

S. in anothər place states: 714 when firm soil is polluted it is purified by smearing it with cow dung, hollow ground (one having holes) is purified by ploughing, ground wet (with im purity ) by covering it (with pure clay brought from elsewhere ) after removing the impure thing. Land is purified by means of four viz., being trodden undər the foot of cows, by digging it up, by burning (firewood or grass thereon), by pouring over it (water, cow's urine or milk &c.) and fifthly, by smearing it (with cowdung) and sixthly, by the lapse of time. Vasistha III. 57 quotes a verse which mentions five means of purification almost in the same words as those of Baudhāyana (except the sixth viz. time). Manu V. 124 mentions five means of purification, viz, sweeping with a broom, smearing with cow dung, sprinkling, digging (and removing), the stay of cows thereon (for one day and night). Visnu Dh. S. 23.57 adds dāha (burning) to the five of Manu. Yāj. I. 188 mentions seven means of the purification of the ground by adding dāha (burn ing) and kāla (lapse of time) to the five mentioned by Manu. According to 715 the Vāmanapurāṇa the ground is purified by digging, burning, sweeping, treading by cows, smearing of cowdung, scrubbing and by sprinkling water. Devala quoted by the Mit. and Aparārka on Yāj. I. 188 gives a more elaborate treatment. According to him polluted ground (bhūmi) is of three kinds, viz. amedhyā (impure), duṣtā (soiled), and malinā (dirty). Where a woman is delivered of a child or dies or is cremated or where a spot has been inhabited by cândālas or where there are heaps of ordure and the like, ground that is full of foul things in this way is declared to be amedhyā. 716 That ground which is polluted by the contact of dogs, pigs, asses, camels and the like becomes duṣtā (soiled) and it becomes malinā (dirty) by charcoal, husk, hair, bones or ashes.

[Vol. 

Devala 717 prescribes the purification of the three kinds of ground: 'Purity is of five kinds, viz. digging up; burning (with wood or grass), smearing (with cowdung ), washing (with water) or the fall of rain. Even amedhyā ground may be purified by these five means employed together (where a corpse is cremated or candālas dwell) or by four (i. e. omitting rainfall or burning in other cases of amedhyā); ground that is dustā is purified by three (digging up, burning and smearing with cowdung) or two (viz. digging up and burning) and malina ground is purified by one (i. e. by digging up). 

The Smộtyarthasara (pp. 73–74) provides that if an idol made of iron or other metal is slightly polluted (as defined above) then it can be purified by means of pancagavya after rubbing it with ashes; similarly a stone idol, when slightly polluted, should be washed with water mixed with the clay from an ant-hill and becomes pure after being treated with pancagavya. Any idol, if polluted with ordure, urine or village mud would become pure after first being flooded for five days with pañca gavya, after being well washed with cow's urine, cowdung and clay from an ant-hill and by being again installed ( with all installation rites). Questions about the pollution of temples by the entry of the so-called untouchables or by the entrance of persons other than brāhmanas in the inmost shrine (garbhagrha) have come before the courts e. g. in Gopala Muppanar v. Dharmakarta Subramania 27 Madras Law Journal p. 253 at p. 258, where reference is made to the ceremonies for the removal of pollution according to the Agamas and Tantras. In S. K. Wodeyar V. Ganapati (37 Bom. L. R. 584) the point arose whether, when a custom was alleged that in a temple at Banavasi in the Canara district none could enter the inner sanctum except persons belonging to the ten sub-divisions of brāhmanas and a Lingayat entered it in spite of the protests of the worshippers in charge of the temple, his entry polluted the temple and whether he was liable to pay for the sum spent over the puri fication of the temple, the High Court of Bombay held that the custom alleged viz, of excluding from the inner sanctum all that were not brāhmanas was proved and that the Lingayat gentle man who entered it in spite of protests was liable to pay dam ages for the wrongful entry.

Pollution of temples or idols

pārvārdha pp. 351-52), the Dharmasindhu (III p. 324) and other medieval digests provision is made for the re-consecration (punaḥ-pratiṣtha) of an idol in a temple when the idol is polluted by the touch of cāndālas or wine or is burnt by fire or is defiled by the touch of sinners or the blood of a brāhmaṇa.718 If the idol be broken in two or more pieces or if it becomes broken (irregularly), if it be burnt or falls from its pedestal or be insulted, is without worship or is touched by an ass or the like animal, or falls on foul ground or is worshipped with the mantras of other gods,-in these ten circumstances Godhood ceases to indwell in the idol. If an idol be touched by robbers, cāņdālas, patita people, by a dog or a woman in her courses or if it be polluted by the touch of a corpse re-consecration is necessary. 

The Viṣnu-dharmasūtra ( 23. 34) provides that idols when polluted should be purified in the same way in which the sub stance of which they are made (such as stone or copper &c.) is purified and then they should be re-consecrated. If the worship of an idol already consecrated is stopped for a day, two days, a month, or two months or it is touched by śūdras or a woman in her monthly course, then at a proper time punyāhavācana should be performed, an even number of brāhmanas should be fed, the idol should be submerged in water for a night and next day bathed with pañca-gavya from a jar full of it to the accompaniment of the respective mantras, then another jar should be filled with pure water and therein the nine kinds of precious stones should be cast, the jar should then have the

This is not the place to discuss in detail the arguments for and against these measures. Many orthodox Hindus hold that their inmost feelings are hurt by this tyranny of the majority in the Legislatures. They feel that these measures are contrary to the four freedoms that are promised in many constitutions viz. freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. These measures are likely to be followed by serious consequences. It is felt that the younger generation now being educated has hardly any faith in religion or in anything being sacred, that the so-called untouchables themselves when once they have asserted their right of entering Hindu temples scarcely ever care to frequent them and the orthodox Hindus also often cease to worship therein. There is the further fear that, if religious feelings even when unreasonable according to progres sive views could be trampled upon by the views of the majority, there is no knowing where the process would stop. There would be temptation for the majority in a country to say that the sacred places of other religions should either not exist at all or be opened for any one not belonging to the faith of the minorities, It would have been far better that, while removing all the disabilities of the so-called untouchables as to employment, public places, courts and education, temples had been left alone for some years to come. The entrance of one set of people into the temples often entails the departure of another set, as said by P. C. in Saklat v. Bella 28 Bom. L. R. 161, which is not a very desirable thing. The equality of the former untouchables in all secular matters is sure to spread in a generation or so to other non-secular matters and so to entry into temples. Adjust ments on an unprecedented scale are taking place in moderno India with regard to usages cherished for ages and the entry OW into temples of the so-called untouchables would have been more effected in a few years without recourse to the threat of armed

Water as purifier

punishments and without bitterness and rancour in the hearts of many people, 

From very ancient times water has been regarded as a great purifier. Rg. VII, 47 and 49 are hymns addressed to waters as divinities and they are there described as themselves pure and as purifying others (as in Rg. VII. 49. 2 and 3 

sucayaḥ pāvakāh'). Similarly Rg. X. 9 and 30 are hymns addressed to waters, in the former of which the waters are invoked to remove whatever sin or wrong one may have commit ted (Rg. X. 9. 8 'idam-āpaḥ pra vahata yat kiñca duritam mayi'). Atharva-veda I. 33 is a hymn addressed to waters, wherein also they are described as 'śucayah pāvakāh' (in A. V. I. 33.1 and 4). The Vāj. S. VI. 17 ( closely following Rg. X. 9. 8) invokes waters to remove whatever is censurable and dirty.719 In Vāi S. IV. 2 the sage pravg May the Waters. Our mothers. purify us !' 720 The Śat. Br. 1. 7. 4.17 (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 213) states' water is a means of purification. Visvarūpa on Yaj. I. 191 quotes a long Vedic passage 721 wherein it is said "what ever creates doubt (whether it is pure or impure) should be touched with waters; then it becomes pure." It is therefore that water (hot or cold) is said to be the purifier of various kinds of vessels and of the ground in Yāj. I. 182-183, 188, Manu V. 109, 112, 126. Gobhila (I. 31-32 ) 722 lays down that when a man engaged in any religious rite hears a mantra addressed to the pitrs, scratches his body, looks at a man of the lowest caste, or allows the wind to escape from his intestines, laughs loudly or speaks an untruth, touches a cat or a mouse, or uses harsh language, has a fit of anger, he should perform ācamana (or touch water). 

According to Yaj. I. 187 and Viṣnu Dh, S. 23.56 a polluted house is purified by being swept and cowdunged. But more stringent rules were laid down if a dog, a sūdra, a patita, a mleccha or a candāla died in a brāhmana's house (vide note 633 above). After keeping the house vacant for the periods

stated in note 633, it is provided by Samvarta 723 that a house that is polluted by the existence of a corpse inside it should be dealt with as follows: earthen pots and cooked food should be Cast away and thrown out of the house which should then be smeared with cowdung and then a goat should be made to go about in it smelling it and then the whole house should be sprinkled over with water in which gold and kušas are put in by brāhmapas rendered holy by the repetition of the Gāyatri mantra; then the house becomes pure. Marici prescribes 724 that if a candāla (merely) entered a house, it can be purified by plastering it with cowdung, but if he were to stay in it long, purification can be had only by heating it and making flames of fire lick its walls. 

The ground in a brāhmaṇa's house, in a temple, in a cow pen should, says Yama, always be regarded as pure (unless it has been polluted). 

A great deal is said in the smrtis and digests about the purification of water. Ap. Dh. S. I. 5. 15. 2 says 725 in a general way that a person after sipping water from what is collected on the ground becomes pure. But the Baud. Dh. S. I. 5. 65. Manu V. 128, Yaj. I. 192, Sankha 16. 12-13, Mārkandeya purāṇa 35.19 and others add that water collected on the ground that is of such volume that a cow can slake its thirst therein, that is in its natural state and is not polluted by any thing impure and that has natural colour (is transparent) and taste and odour (either no odour or a fragrant odour) is pure. Sankha says 726 the same about water collected on a stony surface and adds that the water of a flowing river is always. pure. Devala states 727 that water brought in clean vessels is

pure but when it is (stale owing to its being stored) for one. night (or more ) it should be thrown though it was pure (when originally brought). There 728 is no taint in water that cannot be agitated by any beings and in the water of springs (that flow from hills). Tanks (that are so deep) that they cannot be agitated, rivers, wells and lakes (that are similar) should not be used by the usual way of descent (the ghat) if they come in contact with candālas and other impure persons or things. In Narhari v. Bhimrao, the Bombay High Court had to deal with the question whether a certain tank at Mahad in the Kolaba District could not be resorted to by untouchables for taking water and held that the untouchables were not prevented from using it (vide 39 Bombay L. R. p. 1295). 

Brhaspati provides that if in a well the dead body of an animal with five nails (man or beast) is found or if the well is otherwise extremely polluted all the water of the well should be taken out and the rest should be dried up by means of clothes, then if the well be built with burnt bricks flames of fire should be made to lick the surface of the walls), and then pañcagavya should be poured over when fresh water begins to flow in (from the springs ) 729. Apastamba (q. by Suddhikaumudi p. 299 ) states the circumstances when a well may be said to be extre mely polluted: 'hair, excrements and urine, menstrual dis charge, a dead body-when a well is defiled by these one should take a hundred jars of water from it' (and further purification by putting pañcagavya in it should be resorted to if there is more water). Parāśara VII. 3 says the same about wells (with steps ), wells without steps and tanks. 

Yāj. I. 197 ( =Viṣņu Dh, S. 23. 41) provides that mud and water on roads which come in contact with lowest castes (like candālas), dogs and crows and buildings (like mathas) con structed with burnt bricks are purified by the wind alone

( blowing on them ). Parāśara VII. 34 states 730 that mud and water on roads, boats, paths, grass and whatever is constructed with burnt bricks are rendered pure by the wind and the sun. 

Rain water after it fell on the ground was supposed to be impure 731 for ten days. Similarly Yogiyājñavalkya (q. by S. K. p. 291) remarks that water of a river (dried up in summer) coming down in a flood for the first time ( after rains ) should not be taken ( as pure ) and also water that is agitated by some one (with the feet &c.) and waters that start in a separate stream by themselves from a holy river (like the Ganges ). Even when a well (without steps ) or a well (with a flight of steps ) or a reservoir with a dam is constructed by men of the lowest castes, no prāyaścitta is prescribed for bathing therein or for drinking water therefrom, 732 

Visnu Dh. S. 23. 46 provides 733 that the purification of small reservoirs of water that are static (i, e. from which no streams flow down ) is made in the same way as that of wells ( without steps ), while in the case of large reservoirs no pollu tion is recognised. It is declared that waters are purified by the rays of the sun and the moon and the contact of the wind and by cowdung and the urine of cows; some of these ideas are supported by modern scientific discoveries.

thirsty travellers ) in a forest or from a jar placed near a well (for drawing water by any body) or the water in ( a stone or wooden) trough (meant for all and sundry ) and water from a leather bag even though these may not belong to a śūdra are unfit for drinking, but one may drink even such water as much as he desires when in distress. This shows that even in ancient times water was carried in leather bags or drums where there was scarcity of water and was allowed to be used even by twice-born people. 

We may now turn to the purification of metals and vessels. Baud, Dh, S, I. 5. 34-35 and I. 6. 37-41, Vasistha III, 58 and 61-63, Manu V. 111-114, Yāj. I. 182 and 190, Visņu 23, 2,7 23-24, Sankha 16. 3-4, Smrtyarthasāra p. 70 and others lay down rules about the purification of metals which do not agree in details. Therefore it is proposed to set out only what is said by Manu and one or two others. Manu (V. 113 ff.) says 'The wise declare that the purification of metals (like gold), of precious stones (like emerald), of all articles of stone is brought about by ashes, water and clay. Articles of gold that are not smeared with dirty things like leavings of food &c.) become pure by means of water alone; the same holds good of articles that are found in water (coral and shells), that are made of stone and are made of silver on which no craftsmanship (such as drawing lines or figures ) has been expended. Gold and silver sprang forth through the union of water and fire; therefore their purification is brought about best by their causes, viz. water (in case of slight pollution) and fire (in case of extreme pollution). The purification of copper, iron, bell metal, brass, tin and lead should be brought about by galts ( ashes ), acids and water according to circumstances (i. e. pollution caused). Vasiṣtha (III, 58, 61-63) says: "bell-metal is purified with ashes, gold and silver with water alone and copper with acids.' Yāj. I. 190 says 'the purification of tin. lead and copper is brought about by salt water, acids and ordinary water, of bell-metal and iron by ashes and water,' The Lingapurāṇa (pārvārdha, 189. 58) says: bell-metal is purified by ashes, iron articles by salt; copper, tin and lead by acids; golden and silver vessels are purified by water and jewels, stones, conches and pearls are purified in the same way as metallic vessels. Vide Vāmanapurāņa (14.70) which states that copper pots are purified by acids, tin and lead ones by coufuats. bell-metal by ashes and water. Medhātithi on Mam V. 114

quotes a verse 735 which says 'vessels of bell-metal (or brass) when licked (or breathed over) by cows, in which sūdras have taken their food and which have been defiled by dogs and crows are purified by being scoured ten times with ashes (salts).' Śātātapa has a similar verse (vide Par, M. vol. II part 1 p. 172). 

Elaborate rules are laid down about the purification of polluted pots and vessels used in ordinary life, in Baud. Dh. S. 1. 5. 34-50, 1. 6. 33-42, Yāj. I. 182-183, Viṣnu 23. 2-5, Sankha 16. 1-5 and others. There is some variation in all these, but, as the Mit, on Yāj. I. 190 remarks, it is not an absolute rule that copper must be purified by acids alone but if purification is possible by other means, they may be resorted to. It is not necessary to set out the different modes of purifying vessels. A passage from the Suddhi-prakāśa pp. 117-118 would be sufficient to indicate how this matter of pātraśuddhi (cleansing of polluted vessels) was dealt with in medieval India: "vessels made of gold, silver, conches, shells, stones, precious stones, bell metal, brass, tin, lead are purified by mere water, provided they have no dirt or pollution sticking to them; if these vessels are polluted by the contact of leavings of food &c. they are purified by ashes and water or acids and water according as anyone of these is appropriate; the vessels made of the above substances that are polluted for a long time owing to being used by sūdras or owing to contact with leavings of food should first be scoured with salts (ashes) and water three times and should be then cast into fire so long as it can be borne (without the vessels being broken, melted or burnt up) and then they become pure. Vessels of bell metal when polluted by only dogs, crows, sūdras and leavings of food only once or licked by cows become pure by being scoured ten times with salts and water; but if they are polluted by the above several times then they have to be scoured 21 times for becoming pure. If in a vessel belonging to the three higher warnas à sūdra takes his meal, it becomes pure after being washed four times with salts and being cast in fire and then taken up with hands that are washed clean with water.

woman freshly delivered or by intoxicants or liquors becomes pure after being heated in fire; but if it is polluted several times then it becomes pure by being again manufactured. A vessel of bell-metal that is polluted by being frequently used for holding the water expelled from the mouth after rinsing it or the water in which the feet are washed should be buried in the ground for six months, then heated in fire and then it becomes pure (compare Parāśara VII. 24-25); but if it is polluted thus only once it becomes pure after (being buried in the ground) for ten days. All metal vessels polluted for a short time by the bodily dirts such as urine, excrement, semen become pure after being placed for seven nights in cow's urine or in a great river; but if they are polluted as above many times or are polluted by the contact of a corpse, a freshly delivered woman or a woman in her monthly course they become pure after being thrice washed with salts, acids and water and after being heated in fire till they can bear it, but if these are polluted by urine and for a long time and frequently they become pure by being beaten into shape (manufactured) again. 

Visnu ( 23, 2 and 5 ) provides that all metal vessels when extremely polluted ( as stated in note 710 ) are purified by being cast into fire and that vessels of wood or clay when extremely polluted should be given up, but Devala 736 and others provide that wooden vessels when slightly polluted become pure by being planed or chiselled or by means of clay, cowdung or water and that earthen vessels if not extremely polluted become pure by baing baked in fire 737 ( also Yaj. I. 187). But Vas. III, 59 provides that an earthen vessel if polluted by the contact of wines, urine, excrement, phlegm, tears, pus and blood is not purified even by being burnt in fire. 738 

Special rules are provided for the purification of vessels and implements used in Vedic sacrifices. Baud. Dh, S. (I. 5. 51-52 ) 739 remarks that the camasa vessels used in sacrifices

are purified according to the special Vedic texts, since the Veda says that camasa vessels do not incur the fault of being ucchista when it is soma liquid that is drunk from them, Manu V. 116-117, Yāj. I. 183-185, Viṣnu Dh. S, 23. 8-11, Sankha 16.6, Parāśara VII. 2-3 and others lay down rules about the purification of sacrificial implements. For example, Manu (V. 116-117 ) provides sacrificial vessels should be first rubbed with the right hand (or with darbhas or strainer) and then camasas and cups are to be washed with water before using them in the sacrifice; the carusthāli (the vessel in which the oblation of boiled rice is prepared), sruc (a wooden vessel used for pouring clarified butter on sacrificial fire), and sruva (wooden ladle of a semicircular shape) are purified by being washed with hot water; the sphya (wooden sword), the win nowing basket, the cart (for bringing the soma plant), wooden mortar and pestle, are purified with water (or sprinkling water according to Yāj. I, 184). 

Several rules were laid down about the purification of polluted corn and polluted cooked food. A reference has already been made to the purification of heaps of corn. Common sense, convenience and the loss that may be caused by very stringent provisions are the considerations which prompt the rules on this subject. Visnu 23.25 provides 740 that where a heap of rice (or other grain) is polluted, one should throw away only that portion of it which is actually defiled and should submit the rest to pounding and washing with water; cooked food that exceeds in volume one drona and that has been defiled does not all become tainted, but that throwing away the defiled portion alone, one should sprinkle over the rest water mixed with gold on which the sacred Gāyatri verse has been repeated and should hold it before a goat to see it and should also bring fire near it. Vide Baud. Dh. S. I. 6. 44-48. "If grains of rice are polluted they should be washed and dried. But if it is a large quantity then sprinkling with water is enough; husked rice (if polluted) should be cast away. The same rule applies to cooked offerings. But in the case of large heaps of cooked food that portion which is polluted by dogs or crows should be cast away and the rest should be sprinkled with the Anuvāka

What is polluted food

pavamānaḥ suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. I. 4.8). Gaut. 17. 9-10 pro vide 741 that one should not partake of food that was cooked along with hair and insects (like ants), nor food that is polluted by the contact of a woman in her monthly illness, by a crow or by being struck with the foot (of some one ). But where food is already cooked and then it is smelt by a cow or it is polluted by the falling into it of hair, insects, flies, then Yāj. I. 189 and Parāśara VI. 64-65 provide that in order to purify it water, ashes (with water) or loose earth ( with water) should be cast over it. Ap. Dh. S, I. 5.16. 24-29 provide that one should not partake of food in which hair exists (i. e. it was there from the beginning) or anything else (like nails) that is impure or of food that is touched with an unclean substance or in which an insect that subsists on impure things exists or food which is struck by the feet of any person or in which the excrement or the tail (or limb) of a rat is found. 

The general rule is stated by Manu V. 118 which applies not only to corn and clothes but to many other articles viz. if there is a heap or a large quantity then sprinkling with water (proksana ) suffices for purification but if the quantity is small then washing with water is necessary. Manu V. 125 ( = Viṣnu Dh. S. 23.38) provides that (a small quantity of) cooked food part of which is pecked by birds (whoge flesh is eaten by men), which is smelt by a cow, which is struck with the foot (by a man) and over which some one has sneezed or which is polluted by the falling in of hair and insects becomes pure by casting into it loose earth (and water). Parāśara (VI. 71-74) puts the matter 742 thus: "food licked by dogs and crows or smelt by a cow or ass, if little in quantity, should be thrown away by a brāhmaṇa, but purification should be resorted to if it is a droņa or ādhaka in quantity. That portion which is defiled by the saliva of a dog or crow should be thrown away and water in which gold is put should be sprinkled over the remaining portion, then flames of fire should lick the remaining

food and brāhmaṇas should loudly recite Vedic hymns (like the Pavamānasūkta) over it and then the food becomes fit for eating". The Suddhiprakāśa explains that the wealthy should not throw away food if it is more than a droņa in quantity and a poor man if it is more than an ādhaka 743 

Manu V.115 744 gays that in the case of all liquids (such as oils, ghee &c.) purification (when they are little in quantity) is brought about by means of two kušas dipped into them (or by straining them through a piece of cloth into another pot) and if the quantity is large then by sprinkling (water). Sankha provides 745 that purification is brought about by mere proksana in the case of all exudations (Asafoetida &c.), jaggery, salts, gafflower, saffron and in the case of wool and cotton. Vide note 705 above about certain articles being pure the moment they are transferred from the pots of even mlecchas &c. 

A few words may be said about the purification of different kinds of cloth and garments and the materials of which they are made. Laghu-Asvalāyana (I. 28-30) provides that a white garment is always commended for wearing (as a dhoti), but they are commended for wearing as upper garments and both are not defiled by the touch of anybody. Men may take their food or answer calls of nature while covered with both; trasara is purified by being washed while a silken garment is always pure. Manu V. 120-121, Yāj. I. 186-187 and Visnu (23. 19-22) provide almost in the same words that silken and woollen cloth is cleansed by saline earth (and with water and cow's urine ), Nepalese blankets by the powder of soap berry, clothes made of tree bark with Bilva fruit and linen cloth by (paste of) white mustard. Visnu 23. 6 says 746 that when a garment is extremely polluted that portion thereof which when washed with water loses its colour should be cut off. Sankha 747 quoted by Visva 

743. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 124 for the measures of capacity called drona and adhaka. According to most writers four adhakas are equal to a drona.

Purification of garments 

331 

rüpa on Yāj. I. 182 prescribes that garments are purified by being submitted to hot steam, by washing with water or by cutting off only that portion that is defiled. Parāśara VII. 28 provides that garments made from bamboos and barks of trees, linen and cotton garments, garments of wool and birch bark are purified by mere prokṣaņa. 

The smrtis speak of purification of many other things, which is of little importance and is passed over here. Only a few illustrations are given here. Manu. V. 119 provides that skins and things made of split bamboos (or canes) are cleaned in the same way as clothes, while vegetables, roots and fruits are purified on the analogy of grain. Manu V. 120-121 state that the purification of conches, horns (of buffaloes and rams) and bones and tusks (of the elephant or boar) is to be caused in the same way as that of linen or with cow's urine or water and that grass, wood and straw become pure by being sprinkled with water. Viṣņu Dh. S. 23. 15, 16, 23 and Yāj. I. 185 are very similar. 

From the above it will be clear that purification of subst ances depends on many circumstances, viz. whether they are metallic or are earthen, whether they are solid or liquid, whether a polluted substance is small in quantity or is a big heap, whether the pollution is extremne or insignificant and so on. 

In Manu the purification of substances follows (V. 110) the means of purifying one's own body. Purification of the body by means of ācamana and snāna (bath) has already been described in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 315-316 and 652-653 (about 

camana). 656-668 (about snāna). Purification by bath on adauca has already been dealt with before. Special rules were prescribed for women guilty of adultery (vide H. of Dh, vol. II. 

. 594. vol. III, pp. 647-649), as also for women raped (vide vol. IT p. 575). Snāna (bath) with the clothes on was prescribed for purification of the body when a person touches one who is patita (murderer of a brāhmaṇa &c.), a candāla, a woman freshly delivered, a woman in her monthly illness, a corpge or one who has touched a corpse; also when a man follows a funeral procession or touches a dog (vide Gaut. 14. 28-30, Manu V. 85 and 103, Angiras verse 152, Āp Dh. s. I.. 5. 15. 15-16, Yāj. III. 30). Baud. Dh. S. I, 5. 140 provides that on touching one who sells the Veda (teaches it for money), a yūpa, a funeral pyre, a patita, a dog and a cāņdāla one should

undergo a bath.748 Parāśara also has a similar verse.749 It has already been stated elsewhere (in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 175-176) how the rules about touching untouchables were relaxed when people congregated in a temple or in a religious procession, at marriages and festivals and at holy places. It is said by some that this refers not to the so-called untouchables, but to men who are untouchable owing to āśauca. But this is not correct. The explanation of the Suddhi-kaumudi and Suddhiprakāśa given below makes it clear that the untouchables are meant, In the first place, the words are quite general and not restricted. In the second place, there is no untouchability (except for the mother) on the ground of Jananāsauca and it is most unlikely that a person who has incurred mourning on death should visit a temple or go to a marriage or enter a religious procession, or festival. In the third place, looking to the several occasions mentioned together (particularly pilgrimages, battles, fire in a town or village and commotion or invasion of a country) it appears most unlikely that the verse refers only to āsauca on birth and death, 750 

The ancient and medieval Indians put very great emphasis on purity of mind, of body, of the place where they resided or performed religious rites, of the vessels used by them and of the ingredients of their food and worship. Many of the rules about purification of substances may appear to modern minds as very stringent; but it should not be forgotten that the ancient Indians were imbued with the thought that purity of the mind followed from purity of food

Reason of emphasis on purification

(as stated in the Chandogyopaniṣad VII. 26.2 Sahārasuddhau sattvasuddhih' and by Harita). It would be conceded that some of their rules about purification (such as about large quantities of corn or heaps of cooked food) are based on common sense and convenience. We are probably going to the other extreme in taking our food anywhere and in any surroundings.

CHAPTER IX 

ŚRĀDDHA 

This subject is of great practical importance from several points of view. 

The Brahmapurâna defines śrāddha as follows: 'whatever is given with faith to brāhmaṇas intending it to be for the (benefit of) pitrs at a proper time, in a proper place, to deserv ing persons and in accordance with the prescribed procedure is called sraddha.751. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 217 definessraddha as 'abandonment with faith of an article of food or some sub stitute thereof, intending it for (the benefit of) the departed'. The Kalpataru on srāddha defined it as 'the giving up of sacri. ficial material intending it for pitys and its acceptance by brāhmanas'. The Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara and the Śrād dhaprakāśa define śrāddha in the same way as the Mit, but in a more involved manner. Yaj. I. 268 (= Agnipurana 163. 40-41) states that the pitrs viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas that are the deities of śrāddha, being gratified by śrāddha, give gratification to the ancestors of human beings. This verse and Manu III. 284 make it clear that the three ancestors of a man,

The दीपकलिका on या. I. 218 accepts कल्पतरु : श्राद्धं नाम वेदबोधितपात्रालम्भनपूर्वक प्रमीतपित्रादिदेवतोशको व्यत्यागविशेषः। श्राद्धविवेक p. 1; अत्रापस्तम्बादिसकलवचन पर्यालोचनया प्रमीतमात्रोद्देश्यकासत्यागविशेषस्य ब्राह्मणाधिकरणप्रतिपत्त्यङ्गकस्य श्राद्ध पदार्थत्वं प्रतीयते । श्रा.प्र.p. 4. The श्राद्धविवेक states that ष्यत्याग is enjoined by the words of the Veda (वेदबोधित) and the thing abandoned is handed over to a deserving brāhmana ( पात्रालम्भनपूर्वक ). प्रतिपत्ति in श्रा. प्र. means the 

final disposal of a thing used in a sacrifice e. g. in Darsa-pürnamāsa we have po the sentence सह शाखया प्रस्तरं प्रहरति. Here शाखामहरण is प्रतिपत्तिकर्म (Jai. IV. 10-13) and not अर्थकर्म : similarly, the cremation of an ahitagni with his Fou sacrificial vessels isa प्रतिपत्तिकर्म so far as the यज्ञपात्रs are concerned.

Definition of śrāddha 

viz, the father, paternal grand-father and the paternal great grand-father are respectively to be identified with the three orders of superintending pit; deities, viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, when performing śrāddha. According to some,752 śrāddha denotes three things, viz. homa, the offering of pinda (ball of cooked food) and gratification of brāhmaṇas invited to a dinner; the application of this word to any one of these three can only be in a secondary sense. 

A firm believer in the doctrine of karma, punarjanma (re incarnation) and karma-vipāka (explained above) may find it difficult to reconcile that doctrine with the belief that by offer ing balls of rice to his three deceased paternal ancestors a man brings gratification to the souls of the latter. According to the doctrine of punarjanma (as very clearly and succinctly put in Br. Up. IV. 4.4 and Bhagavad-gitā 2.22) 753 the spirit leaving one body enters into another and a new one. But the doctrine of offering balls of rice to three ancestors requires that the spirits of the three ancestors even after the lapse of 50 or 100 years are still capable of enjoying in an ethereal body the flavour or essence of the rice balls wafted by the wind. Further, Yāj. I. 269 (which is the same as Mārk. 29. 38, Matsya-purāņa 19. 11-12, Agnipurāṇa 163. 41-42) provides that the grand fathers (i. e. pitrs) being themselves gratified (by the offerings of food in srāddha) bestow on men (their descendants ) long life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, mokṣa (final beatitude), all happiness and kingdom. In the Matsya-purāņa (chap. 19, verse 2) a question is asked by the sages how food which a brāhmana (invited at a śrāddha) eats or which is offered into fire is enjoyed by departed spirits that might have assumed (after death) good or evil forms of bodies. The answer given ( verses 3-9) is that fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand fathers are identified with Vasus, Rudras and Adityas respectively according to Vedic passages, that the name and gotra (mentioned at the time of śrāddha), the mantras uttered and faith carry to the pitys the offerings made, that if one's

father has become a god (by his good deeds) the food offered in grăddha becomes nectar and follows him in his state of godhood, if he has become a daitya (an asura) then (the food) reaches him in the form of various enjoyments, if he has become a beast then it becomes grass for him and if he has become a snake the śrāddha food waits on him as wind (serpents are supposed to subsist on wind) and so on. Verses 5-9 of the Matsya, chap. 19 are quoted as from Mārkandeyapurāṇa by the Srāddha kalpalata p. 5. Visvarāpa 754 on Yaj. I. 265 (p. 171 of Tri, ed.) also raises the same objection and gives several replies. One is that this is a matter entirely based on śāstra and so when sāstra says that pitys are gratified and the performer gets desired objects no objection should be raised. Another reply is that the gods Vagus and others that have access everywhere have the power to gratify pitrs wherever they may be situated. He does not call the questioners (nāstika) as some other and later 

writers do. 

The Sraddhakalpalata of Nandapandita 755 (about 1600 A. D.) enters upon an elaborate reply to these persons (whom he dubs atheists) that aver that the performance of śrāddhas for departed fathers and the rest, who according to the particular actions of each go to heaven or hell or to other forms of exist ence serves no purpose. He asks: why is sraddha useless? Is it because there is no prescriptive text laying down an obligation

Does śrāddha serve no purpose

to perform it or is it because sraddha produces no consequences or is it that it is not proved that pitrs and the rest are gratified by śrāddha? To the first he replies that there are such passages as 'therefore a wise man must perform ṣrāddha with all his efforts that lay down the obligation; nor is the 2nd objection proper, since Yāj. I. 269 does declare the rewards (of śrāddha ) viz, long life &c. Nor is the third alternative acceptable. In the śrāddha rites it is not that the mere ancestors named Deva datta and the like are the recipients and that they are denoted by the words pitr, pitāmaha and prapitāmaha, but that those words denote them as accompanied by the superintending deities viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas. Just as by the words Deva datta and the like what is denoted is not merely the bodies ( so named) nor merely the souls, but what is denoted by the words is individual souls as particularised by the bodies; in the same way the words pit? and the like denote Devadatta and others together with the superintending deities (viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas). Therefore, the superintending deities viz, the Vasus and the rest, being gratified by the food and drink offered by the sons and the rest, gratify those also viz. Davadatta and the rest and endow the performers (of śrāddha ) with such rewards as male progeny and the rest. Just as a. woman expecting to be a mother becomes gratified by partaking of the food and drink for which she has a longing in pregnancy and which is given to her by another person for the sustenance of the child in the womb, she satiates also the child in her womb and endows those that offer her the food and drink for which she has longings by bestowing on them some reward in return. Thus the pitss denoted by the words father, grand father and great-grand-father are the deities Vasus, Rudras and Adityas, and not merely (human beings called ) Devadatta and the rest. Hence these deities of śrāddha become the recipients (of gifts) in the śrāddha rite, are gratified by the śrāddha and gratify in their turn the ancestors of human beings. The Srāddha-kalpalatā then quotes 18 verses 756 from the

Mārkandeyapurāpa many of which are found in chap. 28 ( verses 3 ff) of the printed text. It is said 757 that just as a calf finds its own mother from among many cows that are scattered about, so the mantras repeated in srāddha carry the food to the pitřs. 

The explanation offered by the Śrāddha-kalpalatā relying on passages of the Mārkandeyapurāṇa is not satisfactory and is rather far-fetched. The Mārkandeya and the Matsya appear to agree with the doctrine of Vedānta that immediately on leaving one body the soul has recourse to another body, either as a god or a man or a beast or a snake &c. The hypothesis pro pounded is that the food and drink offered in šrāddhas becomes transformed into various substances for the use of the ancestors (Matsya 141. 74–75). But the great difficulty in accepting this explanation is that the ancestors might die at different places, while śrāddha may very often be performed at one place far away from those places. It is difficult to believe that the grass growing in one place where the ancestor has been transformed into a beast as a result of his evil actions is the same that might have been produced from the substances offered in śrāddha at a place hundreds of miles away. Further, if one or all the three ancestors have been transformed into beasts or the like how can they recognize their offspring and bestow on them long life, wealth &c? If the Vasus, Rudras and Adityas bestow these, it is better to say so directly and affirm that pitrs cannot bestow

Theory of Śrāddha examined 

any thing on their progeny. It appears very probable that the worship of ancestors by means of śrāddhas was a very ancient institution and that the doctrines of punarjanma and karmavipāka were comparatively later ones and that Hinduism being all-embracing retained the institution of śrāddhas while adopting also the doctrine of metempsychosis. The institution of srāddha is from one point of view an excellent one. It provides an occasion for remembrance of one's ancestors and relatives that were dear and near when living. The Aryasamāja objects to the institution of sraddha and interprets pitrs in the Rgveda as meaning living men in the Vānapragtha stage. It may be noted that the texts support both views. The Šat. Br. expressly says that food is offered to the father of the sacrificer in the words 'this is for thee.' Viṣnu Dh. S. 75. 4 "He whose father is dead may put down a pinda for his father &c. On the other hand Manu III, 284 states that fathers are spoken of as Vasus, grandfathers as Rudras &c. and Yāj. I. 269 provides that Vasus, Rudras and Adityas are the pitrs and the devatās of śrāddha. These latter are to be explained as con taining an injunction to contemplate upon the pitrs as Vasus, Rudras &c. 

As stated below (p. 347) with regard to the Rgvedic passages, it was on account of the supposed power of pitrs to benefit or harm the living that the cult of the dead became a prominent feature in primitive societies. Offerings and ceremonies which may have in most ancient times been prompted in part at least by the desire to placate the ancestors are continued as tokens of pure affection and remembrance. Various beliefs about pitrs are mentioned 758 in post-Vedic Literature. The Baud. Dh, S. II. 8. 14 summarizes a brāhmana text stating that pitrs move about in the form of birds. The Aušanasa-smrti and Devala quoted by the Kalpataru say the same thing. In the Vāyu purāṇa 759 it is stated that at the time of śrāddha the ancestors

enter the brāhmanas (invited) after assuming an aerial form and that when the best of brāhmaṇas are honoured with clothes, foods, gifts, eatables, liquids, cows, horses and villages, pitrs become pleased. Manu III. 189 and the Aušanasa-smrti also support this notion that pitrs enter the invited brāhmaṇas. The Matsyapurana (18. 5-7 ) enjoins: pindas should be offered to the departed for twelve days after death, since they serve hin as food on his journey and give him great satisfaction. Therefore, the soul leaving the dead body is not taken to the abode of the departed for twelve days after death); the departed spirit hovers near his house, his sons, his wife for twelve days. Therefore for ten days after death milk (and water) should be placed (hung up) in space for ten nights for reducing all torments (or troubles of the departed) and for the removal of the fatigue of the journey (that the departed spirit has to make ). The Viṣnudharmasūtra 760 (20.34-36 ) provides “the departed spirit enjoys in the world of pitrs the food offered in srāddha with the utterance of the word 'svadhā'; whether the departed is in the state of a god or in the place of torments (Hell) or in the form of a lower animal or a human being, the śrāddha food offered by his relatives reaches him; when śrāddha is performed, the performer and the departed soul both certainly secure vigour (or prosperity ).” 

The Brahmapurāņa 761 states that śrāddha is to be treated of under five heads, viz. how, where, when, by whom and with what materials. But before proceeding to deal with these five heads, it is necessary to dilate upon the underlying ideas and significance of the word 'pitarah' from the most ancient times of which we have literary records. 

The word 'pitr' means 'father', but the word 'pitarah' is used in two senses, viz. (1) a man's three immediate deceased ancestors, (2) the early or ancient ancestors of the human race that were supposed to inhabit a separate world (loka) by them

selves. 762 For this second meaning, vide Rg. X. 14. 2 and 7, X 15.2 (translated above pp. 191-92, 194) and Rg. IX.97.39.762a "That Soma which becomes stronger and stronger and makes others strong, that is strained through a strainer, that flows in a stream, protected us by means of the luminary (the Sun)--that Soma with whose help our ancestors knowing the place where the cows were kept concealed) and the higher regions, harassed the mountain for the sake of recovering) the cows.' In Rg. X. 15.1 the pitrs are said to be of three grades, lower, middling or higher. They are also said to be earlier and later ones (Rg. X. 15.2). They are all known to Agni, though all pitrs are not known to their descendants (Rg. X. 15. 13). The pitrs are divided into several groups such as Angirasas, Vairūpas, Atharvans, Bhrgus, Navagvas and Daśagvas (Rg. X. 14,5-6), the Angirasas being particularly associated with Yama who is invoked to come to the sacrifice along with the Angirasas (Rg. X. 14. 3-5). In Rg. I. 763 62. 2 it is said: 

through whose (Indra's) help our ancient ancestors (pitarah), the Angirasas, who sang his praises and who knew the place, found out the cows.' The pitrs called Angiras were, it appears, again subdivided into two classes viz. Navagva and Daśagya 764 both of which words occur in Rg. 1. 62 4, V. 39. 12 and X. 62. 6. In several passages the ancient fathers are identified with the seven sages 765 as in Rg. IV. 42.8 and VI. 22.2 and sometimes the Navagvas and Daśagvas also are said to be the geven sages (Rg. I. 62.4). Angirasas are said to be the song of Agni (Rg. X. 62, 5) and also of Heaven (Rg. IV. 2. 15). The pitrs are often said to regale themselves in the company of gods, 

762. This idea is at least Indo-Iranian, if not Indo-European, The ancient Parsi scriptures speak of Fravashis that were originally the same as pitrs of ancient Hindu works or the Manes among the ancient Romans. They were the everlasting and deified souls of the dead. Gradually the mean ing of Fravashi was extended and even Gods and objects like the Earth and the sky were supposed to have each a Fravashi. Vide S. B. E. vol. 4 p. 262 for the Fravashis of the holy Yama and for the different classes of Fravashis; also S. B. E. vol. 23 pp. 180, 184, 230.

particularly of Yama (Rg. VII. 76, 4, X, 14, 10, X, 15, 8-10). 766 The mitrs are said to be fond of Soma drink (Rg. X. 15. 1 and 5, IX. 97. 39), they lie down on kusa grass (Rg. X. 15.5), they come with Agni and Indra to partake of the offerings (Rg. X. 15. 10 and X. 16.12) and Agni is also said to carry the offerings to the pitrs (Rg. X. 15.12). Fire is supposed to take the spirit of a cremated person to the pitys (Rg. X. 16. 1-2, 5=A, V. 18. 2. 10; Rg. X, 17, 3). In later works also (e. g. in Mārk, chap. 45), Brahmā is supposed to have created in the beginning four classes viz. gods, asuras, pitrs and human beings. Vide also Brahmāndapurāņa, Prakriyā, chap. 8, and upodghāta chap. 9. 35 (ityete pitaro devā devāśca pitaraḥ punaḥ anyonyapitaro hyete). 

It was supposed that the departed spirit, after the cremation of the body, was endowed with an ethereal body and became associated with Yama, the gatherer of departed men (Rg. X. 14.1 and 8, X. 15. 14, X. 16.5), and with pitrs. The departed spirit went to the world of the pitȚs and Agni was implored to take the spirit to the world of the departed whose deeds were good and to the stride of Visņu (Rg. X. 14. 9, X. 15.3, X. 16. 4). 

Although Yama is said to dwell in heaven (divi) in Rg. X. 64.3, he is really a god of the middle region, as the Nirukta states, 767 The Atharvaveda states: 768 let us worship with obeisance the fathers and grandfathers of our father, that enter the wide middle regions, that dwell on the earth and in heaven.' In Rg. I. 35.6 769 it is said : there are three worlds; two of them (Heaven and earth) are in the lap of Savitr; one (i. e. the middle region) is in the domain of Yama where departed spirits congregate, 'The great Luminary (the Sun) has risen, a gift of the pit;s' (Rg. X. 107. 1). In the Tai. Br. I. 3. 10. 5 770

The World of Pitrs 

it is said that the pitrs dwell in the third world from this. This means that after bhūloka and antariksa comes the pitsloka. In the Br. Up. I. 5.16 three worlds of men, pitrs and gods are separately mentioned. In Rg. X. 135. 1-7, Yama is spoken of in somewhat different language. He is in this hymn men tioned as a god by himself and not as the first mortal who made a path (Rg. X. 14. 2) or as the gatherer of men (X. 14.1) or as being in company of the pitrs. In a few other places Yama is no doubt called rājan and praised in the same breath with Varupa (Rg. X. 14,7). But such a position is very rarely mentioned, For the further development of Yama and his assistants as the punishers of men for evil deeds, vide pp. 159-160 above and notes 381-386. 

There is another division of pitrs viz. pitaraḥ somavantaḥ,771 pitaraḥ barhi ṣadah, pitarah agniṣvāttāḥ. The latter two are named in Rg. X. 15. 4 and 11 (which occur also in Tai. S. II, 6. 12. 2). The Sat. Br. defines these as follows:-"those that performed a soma sacrifice are pitaraḥ somavantah; those that offered cooked oblations (like caru and purodāsa) and secured a world are pitarah barhi sadah; those that did none of these (two actions) and whom fire consumes when burning them are ' pitarah agniṣvāttāḥ;' these are the only ones that are pitarah." The Tai.772 Br. has a somewhat similar passage and the Kāthaka Samhita IX. 6. 17 also refers to these three kinds of pitrs. Later writers introduced certain changes in the mean ings of the words for the different classes of pitys and also in creased the number of the classes of pitys. For example, the Nandipurāņa q. by Hemādri states: the pitrs of brāhmaṇas are called 'agniṣvātta', those of ksatriyas 'barhiṣadah', those of vaisyas 'kāvyas', those of südras aukālin' and those of mle cchas and untouchables are called 'vyāma'. 773 Even Manu

(III, 193-198) mentions several classes of pitys, connects pitrs called Somapās, Havirbhujaḥ Ājyapās and Sukālins with the four varnas and in III, 199 states that the pitrs of brāh manas are designated as Anagnidagdha, Agnidagdha, Kāvya, Barhiṣad, Agniṣvātta and Saumya. Those verses of Manu appear to summarize different traditions about the several classes of pitys. Vide Matsyapurāņa 141. 4 for the same last four names and 141. 15-18 for their definitions. In Sătātapa smrti (VI. 5–6) twelve groups or divisions of pilys are mentioned viz. pindabhājaḥ (three), lepabhājaḥ (three), Nāndimukhas (three) and Aśrumukhas (three). This is a classification of pitrs from two different standpoints. In Váyu 72,1 and 73.60, Brahmānda (Upodghāta 9.53), Padma V. 9. 2-3, Viṣnudharmo ttara I. 138. 2-3 and other Purāṇas the classes of pitrs are said to be seven, three of which are formless (amūrti mat) and four have forms (mūrtimat) and they and their offspring are des cribed in detail. All this is passed over here. The Skanda purāņa (VI. 216. 9-10) speaks of nine groups of pitrs, being Agni ṣvāttāḥ, Barhiṣadaḥ, Ājyapāḥ, Somapāḥ, Raṣmipāḥ, Upahūtāḥ, those called 'āyantunah', 'Srāddhabhujaḥ, Nāndimukhāh. In this list old and new elements are mixed up. The Indian mind often revels in divisions, sub-divisions and classifications with out much basis therefor and this is probably an illustration of that tendency. Manu (III. 201) states that from the sages the pitrs sprang, from the pitrs sprang gods and human beings and from the gods arose the whole world whether moving or immo vable. It is remarkable that here the gods are spoken of as springing from the pitrs. This is really a mere eulogy of pitrs (i. e. it is an arthavāda).

(pañcajanā mama hotram juṣadhyam) and other passages, the Ait. Br. (13.7 or 3.31) explains that they are the five classes, viz. Gandharvas with Apsarases, pitrs, devas, sarpas and rākṣasas. The Nirukta III. 8 partly follows this explanation and also gives another. In the Atharvaveda X, 6.32 the gods, pitrs and men are mentioned in that order. The ancient Vedic texts and practice make a sharp distinction between the Gods and the Pitrs. The Tai. S. VI. 1.1.1 states: 'the gods and men divided the quarters, the gods took the east, pitrs the south, men the west and Rudras the north.' The general rule is that sacrifices for gods are begun in the forenoon, while the pitr-yajña is performed in the afternoon (San. Br.).775 The Sat. Br. II, 4.2.2 narrates that the pitrs wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder (and under the left arm) and bending their left knee approached Prajāpati, when Prajāpati said to them 'you will have food at the end of) each month (on the Amāvāsyā), your svadhā (cordial) will be swiftness of thought and the moon will be your light,' while to the gods he had said that sacrifice will be their food and the sun their light. The Tai. Br. 776 I. 3. 10.4 appears to make a distinction between pitrs who are of the nature and position of gods and pitrs that are more or less like human beings. 

The Kausika-sūtra (1. 9-23) neatly collects in one place the difference in the procedure of the rites meant for gods and for pitrs. The performer of rites for gods wears the sacred thread on the left shoulder and under the right armpit, while in the case of the rites for pitrs it is worn on the right shoulder and under the left arm; the rite for gods is either begun facing the east or north, while that for the pitss is begun facing the south; the rite for gods is finished in the north-east (or north or east), while that for the pitys is completed in the south-west; an action is done only once for pitrs, while for gods at least thrice or as many times as the texts direct; in going round (perambulating) the right side is turned towards gods and the left one in the case of pitrs; offerings are made to gods with the words 'svāha' and 'vaṣat', while they are made to pitřs with 'svadhā' and

'namaskāra'; the darbhas employed in rites for Fathers are those that are taken out from the earth with their roots, while for gods darbhas used are cut a little above the roots. The Baud. Sr. II, 2. also mentions some of these in one place. 777 The Rgveda itself (in X. 14,3'svāhānye svadhayānye madanti') marks this distinction in the words employed at the offerings to Gods and Pitrs. The Sat. Br. (II. 1,3,4 and II. 1.4.9) speaks of the gods as immortal and of the Fathers as mortal. 

Though the gods and pitřs are placed in separate classes, still the pitss partake of some characteristics of the divine. As Rg. X. 15. 8 shows, the pitės drank Soma. In Rg. X.68.11 it is said that the pitȚs adorned the sky with nakṣatras (naksatrebhiḥ pitaro dyām-apimśan) and placed darkness in the night and light in the day. The pitrs are said to have found out the light that was secreted and to have produced the Dawn (Rg. VII. 76. 4). Here the pitys are credited with powers possessed by the highest gods. The pitrs are invoked with affection and regard for conferring various boons and their favour is sought in various ways. In Rg. X, 14. 6 the good will (sumati) and favour (saumanasa) of the pitrs are sought. In Rg. X. 15. 1. and 5 the protection of pitrs is sought. They are requested to grant happiness unmixed with trouble (Rg. X. 15. 4.), to bestow wealth on the sacrificer (Rg. X. 15.7 and 11) and on his son. Rg. X. 15.11 and A. V. 18. 3. 14778 seek the bestowal of wealth and heroic sons, A. V. 14. 2.73 says ‘May the pitrs who throng round the bride to see her grant her happiness endowed with progeny.' 779 In the Vāj. S.

It should not be, however, supposed that the element of fear of the pitrs is altogether wanting. 780a For example, Rg. X. 15.6 prays 'whatever fault we may commit in reference to you through our being (erring) men do not injure us for that.' In Rg. III. 55. 2 we read 'May the gods and the ancient pitrs who know the place (of the cows or the path ) not harm us here.' In Rg.X.66. 14 it is said the Vasisthas praising the gods fashioned speech (hymns ) like pitys and like sages.' Here pitrs and rșis are separate groups and Vasisthas are compared to both.7805 

In many passages of the Vedic Literature the word pitarah is applied to the three immediate deceased male ancestors of a man. "Therefore up to three generations they specify (the ancestors) by name; for so many are the ones to whom sacrifice is offered' (vide n. 772 above). The Sat. Br. II, 4. 2. 19 781 mentions the presentation formulas of the cakes to the father, grand-father and great-grand-father and

Compare Vulliamy's 'Immortal man' (pp. 24-25) for fear and affection as the elements of the attitude towards the dead among primitive as well as civilized men. 1780 b. देवाः सौम्याश्च काव्याश्च अयज्वानो ह्ययोनिजाः। देवास्ते पितरः सर्वे देवास्तान्वादयन्त्युत॥ मनुष्यपितरश्चैव तेभ्योऽन्ये लौकिकाः स्मृताः । पिता पितामहश्चैव तथा यः प्रपितामहः॥ ब्रह्माण्डपुराण II. 28.70-71; अङ्गिराश्च क्रतुश्चैव कश्यपश्च महाऋषिः। एते कुरुकुलश्रेष्ठ महायोगेश्वराः स्मृताः। एते च पितरो राजन्नेष श्राद्धविधिः परः । प्रेतास्तु पिण्ड सम्बन्धान्मुच्यन्ते तेन कर्मणा ॥ अनु. 92.21-22.

then states that the performer mutters the words "here, O fathers! regale yourselves, like bulls come here each to his own share' (Vāj. S. II. 31 first half). Some (such as Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1) repeated the formula "this here (ball of rice ) is for thee and (for those ) that come after thee." But the Śat. Br. emphatically says that he should not offer with this formula, but rather with the formula 'this here is for thee. In Sat. Br. XII. 8. 1. 17 the three immediate paternal ancestors are said to be svadhā-loving. Relying on these Vedic passages and on the fact that Manu (III. 221 ) and Visnudharma sūtra (21. 3,75. 4) prescribe the invocation of pitrs after men tioning their gotra and names that the Srāddhaprakāśa (p. 13) concludes that it is really the father and the other ancestors that are the deities of śrāddha and not Vasu, Rudra and Aditya, since these latter have no gotra and that the description of the father and others as Vasu, Rudra and Aditya is meant only for contemplation (on them as identical with Vasus &c.). On a passage of the Brahmapurāņa 782 prescribing that the perfor mer should say to the invited brāhmanas that he would call the pitrs to the rites and that when the brāhmaṇas give per mission to call them he should do so, the Śr. P. (p. 204) remarks that the pitrs here meant are the divine ones viz. Vasus, Rudras and Adityas and also the human ones viz. the performer's father and the rest. The Vāyupurāpa (56. 65-66) Brahmānda and Anu. distinguish between pitrs who are above and pitrs who are laukika, viz. father, grand-father and great-grand-father. Vide also Vāyu 70. 34 for pitrs that are like gods. 

In the post-Vedic Literature, particularly in the Purānas, a great deal is said about the origin and classes of pitrs. For example, the Vāyupurāṇa 56. 18 speaks of three classes of pitrs viz. 'kāvyāh, barhisadah and agnisvāttāḥ', while the same Purāna, chap. 73, Varāha 13. 16 ff, Padma (Srsti 9. 2-4) and Brahmānda III. 10.1 speak of the origin of pitrs of seven classes that dwell in heaven, four of which have a form ( mürlimat ) and three of which are without form (amūrta). The Śatātapa-smrti (6. 5-6 ) speaks of 12 pitrs viz. pindabhājah, lepabhājah, nāndimukhāḥ and aśrumukhāḥ. All such descrip tions have to be passed over from considerations of space.

Promulgators of śrāddha rites 

349 

From the sūtra period ( about 600 B.C.) to the most modern among medieval Dharmaśāstra works the authors wax eloquent over the praises or the importance or benefits of the institution of śrāddhas. One of the earliest works among these, viz. the Ap. Dh. S. gives the following interesting information : 783 “Formerly men and gods lived together in this world. The gods went to heaven owing to sacrifices (i. e, as a reward of sacrifices that they performed), but men remained behind. Those among men who perform sacrifices in the same way as the gods did, dwell in the other world (i. e. heaven) with the gods and Brahman. Then (seeing that men lagged behind) Manu promulgated the rite which is designated by the word 'śrāddha' and which tends to the salvation (or happiness) of mankind. In this rite the Manes (pitaraḥ) are the deities but the brāhmaṇas (that are fed) are in the place of the āhavaniya fire (in which in sacrifices to gods oblations are offered)". On account of this last sūtra Haradatta (com, of Āp. Dh, S.) and others hold that feeding the brāhmaṇas is the princi pal act at a śrāddha. The Brahmāndapurāņa (Upodghātapāda 9. 15. and 10. 99) speaks of Manu as the promulgator of śrāddha rites and Visņupurāņa III. 1. 30, Vāyu 44. 38 and Bhāgavata III. 1, 22 designate Manu as Srāddha-deva, Similarly, in the Sāntiparva 345.784 14-21 and the Visnu-dharmottara I.139.14-16 it is stated that the institution of śrāddha was established in the Boar incarnation by Visnu and that Vispu should be regarded as dwelling in the three pindas offered to the father, grand-father and great-grandfather. From this and from the passage of the Ap. Dh. S. cited above we may infer that it was believed even several centuries before Christ that the institution of śrāddhas had a hoary antiquity behind it and that it was as old as Manu, the father of mankind according to the Rgveda (VIII. 63.1, VIII. 30. 3.). It is, however, very remarkable that the word 'śrāddha' itself does not occur in any undoubtedly authentic and ancient Vedic passage, though the rite called Piņdapitr yajña 785 (performed on the amāvāsyā of each month by an

[Vol. Ahitāgni), the Mahāpitryajña (performed in the Cāturmāsya called Sākamedha) and the rites called Astakās were known to the early Vedic literature. The word śrāddha occurs in the Kathopaniṣad (1.3.17) 'whoever proclaims this highly esoteric doctrine in an assembly of brāhmaṇas or at the time of śrāddha tends to secure immortality.'786 The other early occurrences of the word śrāddha known to me are confined to the sutra literature. The most reasonable and probable inference to be drawn from these facts is this that only a few rites (mentioned just above) were known as related to the pitss and that there fore no need arose for a generic term in very ancient times to comprehend several rites for the pitrs. But when the number of rites in honour of pitss increased, the generic term 'śrāddha' was hit upon. 

A few samples of the panegyrics on śrāddha may be set out here. The Baud. 787 Dh. S. states that rites for the Fathers confer long life, heaven, fame and prosperity. The Harivamsa 788 says 'the would derives support from śrāddha and Yoga (i. e. Mokṣa) springs from it.' Sumantu 789 quoted in the Smộticandrikā (śrāddha p. 333 ) states nothing else is declared to be more beneficial than śrāddha.' The Visnupurāṇa (III. 14, 1-4) avers that if a man performs śrāddha with faith he thereby propitiates Brahmā, Indra, Rudra and the other gods, sages, birds, men, beasts, creeping animals, hosts of pitrs and whatever else is styled a being and the whole world. Yāj. I. 270 790 promising long life and several other benefits arising from gratifying pitys has already been quoted above (p. 337). Yama has a similar verse. It is said in a passage of the Visnudharmottara 791 quoted by the Srāddhasāra (p,6) and Srāddhaprakāśa (pp. 11-12) that the pinda offered to the

Panegyries of sraddha 

great-grandfather is declared to be god Vāsudeva himself, the one to the grandfather is designated Sankarsana, that to the father is known as Pradyumna and the offerer of the pindas is him self in the position of Aniruddha. In Sāntiparva 345. 21 it is stated that Visnu should be looked upon as staying in the three pindas. In the Kūrmapurāņa it is stated on the day of Amāvāsyā the pitrs assuming an aerial form come to the door of their former haunt and mark whether śrāddha is being per formed by men of their family. This they do till sunset. When the sun sets, being oppressed by hunger and thirst, they become full of despair and feel sorrow, breathe heavily for a long time and go away condemning their descendants. The pitrs of him who does not offer srāddha on amāvāsyā, even with water or vegetables, go away after cursing him'. 

It is necessary to say a few words about the derivation of the word 'srāddha'. That the word is derived from 'sraddhā' is quite clear. In the definition quoted above from the Brahma purāṇa and the definition 792 given by Marici and Brhaspati the connection of śrāddha with sraddha is emphasized. In śrāddha one entertains the firm faith or conviction that what is given up to the brāhmaṇas for the benefit of the departed man or the Fathers will reach him or them in some way. The Skandapurana VI. 218.3 says that śrāddha is so called because śraddhā is the root (or main spring) of that rite. This means that there is not only the conviction stated above but that there is a firm belief that a person is under an obligation to offer it. Sraddhā is deified and addressed as a deity in Rg. 793 X. 151. 1-5, the first verse of which is explained in the Nirukta (IX, 31). The word also occurs in Rg. II. 26.3, VII. 32. 14, VIII, 1.31, IX. 113. 4. In some verses the two components of the word 

sraddhā' (viz. srat' and 'dhā') are separated without any change in the meaning. For example, in Rg. II. 12. 5 (= A. V. 20. 34, 5) it is said 'Have faith in him; O people! he is Indra'. In Rg. X. 147. 1, addressed to Indra, we have I have faith in that high wrath of yours &c.' (śratte dadhāmi

prathamāya manyave). In the Tai, S. VII. 4. 1. 1. it is 794 said “Brhaspati desired 'may the gods put faith in me, may I reach the position of being their priest'". Vide also Rg. I. 103.5. Śrat and sraddhā are both mentioned in the Nighantu (III. 10) as meaning 'satya'. In the Vāj. S. 19.77 we are told that Prajāpati put Sraddhā in truth and aśraddha in falsehood, while in Vāj. S. 19.30, it is said that truth is obtained by sraddhā. 

In the post-vedic Literature, Pāṇini explains the forms śrāddhin' and 'śrāddhika' in y. 2. 85, in the sense of one who has eaten a śrāddha dinner.' The word 'śrāddha' may be derived from sraddhā according to Pān. V.1.109 795. Sraddha is variously defined. In the bhāsya on Yogasūtra I. 20, 'śraddha' is defined as the composure of the mind 796 (or men tal approval). Devala defines sraddhā: 'confidence (in the efficacy) of religious acts is called sraddhā; one who has no faith has no reason (or motive) for engaging in religious acts: 797. The Srāddhasūtra 798 of Katyāyana prescribes 'one endowed with śraddhā should offer śrāddha even with vege tables (if nothing else is available). Vide Manu III, 275 which emphasizes sraddhā for the gratification of pitrs. The Mārkandeyapurāņa (29. 27) emphasizes 799 the relation of śrāddha to sraddhā and states that what is offered at śrāddhas becomes transformed into that kind of food for the use of the pitrs who require food in the new bodies they might have assu med according to the doctrine of karma and punarjanma and it also remarks that arāddha offered with wealth acquired in an improper or unjust way is a means of gratification to the pitrs that are born as cāņdālas, pukkasas and similar very low grades of people.

It has already been stated above (pp. 349-350) that in very ancient times there were only three rites for departed ancestors, viz. Pinda-pitr-yajña (offered by those who had consecrated the srauta fires) or monthly Śrāddha in the case of those who had not done so (vide e. g. Ašv. Gr. II. 5. 10, Hir. Gr. II. 10. 1, Āp. Gr. VIII. 21. 1, Visnupurāņa III. 14. 3 &c.), the Mahāpitr yajña and the Astakā śrāddhas. The first two have been already described in vol. IL (as said above), but the Astakā śrāddhas have not been described at all so far. Therefore some remarks will be offered here about them. They are of special importance, but the authorities present great variations on almost all points such as the number of days and the months in which they were to be performed, the deities to be worshipped, the offerings to be made and the procedure to be followed. 

Gaut. (VIII, 19) mentions 'Astakā' rite as the first among the seven kinds of pākayajñas and as one of the forty samskāras. Astakā appears to have meant the 8th tithi in any month after the Full Moon day (vide Sat. Br. VI. 4. 2.10). The Sat. Br. states 800 'On the 8th day (after full moon) he (the performer of agnicayana ) collects the materials for the fire pan, for sacred to Prajāpati is the 8th day (after full moon) and sacred to Prajapati is this rite viz. the firepan.' Sabara in his Bhāsya on Jai.801 I.3.cites a verse occurring in the A, V. III, 10. 2 and in the Ap. M. P. II. 20. 27 as a mantra indicative of Astakā. The mantra is "May that (Astakā) night be very auspicious for us, whom people welcome like a cow coming towards a person and which is the wife of the Year.' In the A. V. IIL 10. 8 the Ekāstakā is said to have the year (Samvatsara ) as husband. The Tai. S. VII. 4. 8. 1. provides 802' Men about to take dikṣā (consecration) for a Samvatsarasattra should undergo dikṣā on the Ekāṣtakā; what is called Ekāstakā is the wife of the year.' Jai. (VI. 5. 32-37) explains that Ekāstakā is the 8th tithi after the Full Moon of Māgha. The Āp. Gr. (quoted by Haradatta

on Gaut. 8. 19) says 803 the same, but adds that on it (the 8th tithi) the moon is in Jyesthā constellation. This means that if the 8th tithi is spread over two days, then that day on which the moon is in Jyesthā would be called Ekāstakā,804 The Hir. Gr. (II, 15.9) also says that Ekāstakā is called the wife of the 

year. 805 

According to the Āśw. Gs. II, 4. 1 the Astakā days (and rites ) were four, viz. the 8th tithis of the dark halves of the four months of the two seasons of hemanta and śiśira (i. e. of Mārgaśirṣa, Pausa, Māgha and Phālguna). Most of the Grhya sütras viz. Mānava Gr. II. 8, Sān. Gr. III. 12.1, Khādira Gr. III. 3.27, Kathaka Gr. 61.1, Kausitaki Gr. III. 15. 1 and Pār, Gr. UIT. 3 say that there are only three Astakā rites viz. on the 8th after the Full Moon day of Mārgaśīrsa (called agrahāyani) i.e. in the dark halves of Mārgasirsa, Pausa (or Taisa) and Māgha. The Gobhila Gr. III, 10.48 mentions that the Astakās are four according to Kautsa and in all flesh is to be offered, but that Gautama, Audgāhamāni and Vārkakhandi prescribe only three and Gobhila follows these latter, The Baud. Gr. II. 11. 1 provides that the three Astakā homas are performed in the months of Taiņa, Māgha and Phālguna. Āśv. Gr. II. 4.2 refers to an option that Astakā rites were performed only on one Astami (and not on three or four). The Baud. Gr. provides that 806 the rite may be compressed into the three days (7th, 8th and 9th ) of the dark half of Māgha or even in one day (i.e. 8th of the dark half of Māgha). The Hir. Gr. (II. 14. 2)

804 According to a Vārtika on Pan, VII. 3. 45 the word Astakā is formed from 'astan.' aria 9 on mora VII. 3.45 teaches that from 3137 we get Astakā as meaning a rite in which the pitrs are the deities and Astika in any other sense (such as the ani). 

805 The Full Moon night of Māgha is said to be the mouth of the year i. e, the year began on that day in ancient times. The Astakā day after the Full Moon day was the first and most important festival after the Full Moon and it was younger than the beginning of the year. It is probable that because of this it was spoken of as the wife of the year.

describes only one Astakā rite viz. the Ekāstaka in the dark half of Māgha. The Bhāradvāja Gșhya II. 15 also speaks of only Ekāstakā but adds that the 8th of the dark half of Māgha on which the moon is in Jyesthā is called Ekāstakā. According to Hir. Gr. II. 14 and 15 the one Astakā extended over three days viz. 8th, 9th (on which a cow was sacrificed for the pitrs) and 10th (which was the Anvastakā). The Vaikhānasa-smārta sūtra (ed. by Caland) IV. 8 says that Astakā is to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Māgha and Bhādrapada or on the 7th, 9th or 10th tithi. 

There is divergence in the offerings also. The Kāthaka Gș (61.3), Jaimini Gr. 2.3 and Sān. Gr. (III, 12.2 ) provide that on the three different Astakās the offerings are of cooked vegetables, flesh and apūpas (cakes), while the Pār. Gr. III, 3 and Khădira Gr. III. 3. 29-30 put apūpas for the first Astakā (and hence Gobhila Gr. III, 10. 9 designates it apūpāṣtaka) and boiled vegetables on the last. According to Khādira Gr. III, 4. 1 a cow is sacrificed. According to Āśv. Gr. II. 4.7-10, Gobhila Gr. IV. 1. 18-22, Kausika 138.2, Baud. Gr. II, 11, 51-61, on the 8th day very many options are given, viz, either to sacrifice a cow or a ram or a goat; or to offer some jungle flesh that may be available or flesh mixed with sesame and honey, or flesh of the rhinoceros, deer, buffalo, ram, boar, spotted deer, hare, Rohita deer, pigeons, śārnga and other birds, or an old red goat; fishes or rice cooked in milk so as to form thin gruel, or gifts only of uncooked corn or fruits and roots, or gold may be offered or only grass for cows or oxen or one may burn some thickets in a forest or present jars for holding water to those deeply learned in the Veda or should recite the mantras relating to śrāddhas, saying 'this is the Astakā I offer,' but one should not remain without observing the Astakā day in some such manner as the above 807

applied to a rite in which the pitrs are the deities worshipped, the greatest divergence prevails as to the devatā of the Astakās. The Āśv. Gr. (II. 4.3 and II. 5. 3-5) provides that on the 7th of the dark half the offerings are made to the pitrs and on the 9th also, but Āśv. II, 4. 12 refers to the eight options as regards the deity of the 8th day, viz. Viśve-devāh (all the gods ), Agni, Sürya, Prajāpati, Rātri (night), Naksatras (constellations ), the seasons, the Pitrs, Pašus (cattle). The Gobhila Gr. III. 10.1 starts 808 by saying that Night is the devatā of Astakā, but adds that there are other views about the devatā being Agni, the Pitrs, Prajāpati, Řtus (seasons) or all Gods. 

The procedure of Astakā comprises three parts, viz. homa, inviting brāhmaṇas for dinner (up to seeing them go away after dinner) and the rite called Anvastakya or Anvastakā. When the Astakās were deemed to be three or four performed in the several months noted above, all these were gone through at each Aṣtakā. When the Astakā rite was performed only in one month i. e, after the Full moon in Māgha, the above parts were performed on three days, 7th, 8th and 9th of the dark half. When compressed in one day only, they must have been per formed one after another on the same day. 

Many of the Grhyasūtras, such as those of Āśvalāyana, Kausika, Gobhila, Hiranyakeśin and Baudhāyana describe a very elaborate procedure in the case of Astakās. One of the shortest being that contained in Ap. Gr. (VIII. 21 and 22 ) is given here by way of sample 808a. After defining Ekāstakā (in VIII, 21. 10) Āp. proceeds: 'He (the performer of the Astaka rite) should perform subsidiary (or preparatory) rites in the evening of the previous day (i.e, on the 7th of the dark half). He cooks (or bakes) a cake from rice taken up (from a heap) in four cups; according to some teachers the cake is prepared on eight potsherds (like a purodāsa). After the actions up to the

The rest of the cake that is already baked is divided by him into eight parts and offered to the brāhmaṇas 811. On the following day he prepares the cow for immolation by touch ing her with a darbha with the words 'I make thee that are agreeable to the Fathers ready (for sacrifice)'. Having silently (i, e, without uttering the word svāhā ) offered five 812 oblations of clarified butter, having cooked the omentum of that (cow) and having spread under the cooked omentum) and sprinkled over it clarified butter he offers it with a palāśa leaf from the middle or the end of the stalk with the next verse (i. e. Āp. M. P. II. 20. 28), 813 He offers boiled rice together with the flesh (of the cow) with the next verses (seven from Ap. M. P. II. 20. 29-35). He offers the food of flour cooked (in milk) with the next verse (Ap. M. P. II. 21.1 'Ukthyaścātirātrasca'). 814 Then (he offers) the oblations of clarified butter with the follow ing (eight) verses ( Āp. M. P. II. 21. 2–9). The rites from Svistakrt. 815 down to the placing of the pindas are the same as at the monthly śrāddha (described in Āp. Gr. VIII-21. 1-9). Some teachers prescribe that the pindas are to be offered the day after the Astakā (i. e, on the 9th of the dark half). Here follows another method (of celebrating the Astakā rite ). He sacrifices curds with his joined hands in the same way as he offers the cake. Having left over from the meat of the cow) as much as may be required, he performs on the day following

(the Astakā day) the Anvastakā rite. Its procedure is explain ed by the description of the monthly śrāddha. 

Though Āp. Gr. (II. 5.3) and San. Gr. III, 13. 7 state that the Anvastakya rite follows the procedure of Pipdapitryajña, some Grhyasūtras (such as Khădira III, 5, Gobhila IV. 2-3) give very elaborate descriptions of that rite. The Āśv. Gr. and Visnudharmasūtra 74 follow a middle course. The description in Āśv. Gr. is comparatively brief and it is set out below. It may be noted that some Grhya-sūtras state that the Anvastakya rite is performed on the 9th or 10th of the dark half (e. g. Khădira Gr. III. 5. 1 'navamim daśamim vānvastakyam )'. Further, it may be stated that though most Grhyasūtras call the rite Anvastakya still it is also called Anvastaka by Pār. Gr. III, 3. 10, Manu IV. 150, Visnudharmasūtra 74.1 and 76. 1. The most notable peculiarity of this rite is that therein female ancestors are invoked and offerings are made to them of which liquor (surā), scum of boiled rice, collyrium, salves and garlands form part. Though some sūtras (like Āớv. Gr. II. 5) declare that the Astakā and Anvaṣtakya are modelled on the monthly śrāddha or Pindapitṣyajña, others (like the Baud. Gr. III, 12. 1. Gobhila Gr. IV, 4., Khădira III, 5. 35) say that the Astakā or Anvastakya is the norm which is followed in the Pindapitryājña and all the śrāddhas. The Kāthaka Gr. (66. 1, 67. 1, 68. 1, 69. 1) avers 816 that the first śrāddha, the other srāddhas (such as sapiņdikarana), Pasuśrāddha (in which the flesh of an animal is offered) and the śrāddha performed every month follow the procedure of Astakā. The Pipda-pitryajña could be offered on amāvāsyā only by one who was āhitāgni (i.e. had kept the sacred vedic fires). It is impossible to believe that everyone became āhitāgni. The case was probably the reverse i. e. only a few became āhitāgnis and the rest had only the grhya fire or many of the rest were without even the grhya fire. It appears possible that all were required to offer śrāddha on amāvāsyā on the analogy of pindapitryajña. As the latter became rare, the requirement of offering śrāddha on amăvāsvā. remained and in the sütras and smrtis all the details were mentioned under māsiśrāddha and in the case of the other grāddhas the sutras and smrtis pointed out only what was to be omitted. It is owing to this that the māsiśrāddha came to be called the prakrti and the other śrāddhas were called mikro

or variations of the māsišrāddha. Most of the details of the pindapitļyajña were required in māsiśrāddha and a few (such as giving arghya, gandha, dipa ) were added and more elaborate rules evolved 

The Anvaṣtakya817 is described in the Āøv. Gr. (II. 5. 2-15) as follows:-Having prepared a portion of the same meat,818 having established the fire on a surface sloping towards the south, having fenced it in and made a door on the north side of the enclosed shed, having strewn round the fire three times sacrificial grass with its roots without touching it, turning the left side (of one's body) towards the fire, he should place down the things to be offered, boiled rice, boiled rice mixed with sesamum, rice cooked in milk, meal pap with curds and meal pap with honey. The ceremony should follow the ritual of the Pindapitryajña (vide Āśv. Śr. II. 6). Having sacrificed (part of the foods specified except meal-pap) with honey let him offer portions of those substances to the pitys and to their wives with the addition of liquor and the scum of boiled rice. Some place the portion to be offered into pits, which may be two or six. In those situated to the east he should present the offerings to the pitrs; in those to the west, to the wives. Thereby the cere mony celebrated in the rainy season on the Maghā day in the dark fortnight after the full moon of Prausthapada (i. e. Bhadrapada) has been declared. And thus he should offer (a festival like the Anvastakā ) to the pitrs every month, obsery ing uneven 819 numbers. He should give food at least to nine (brāhmanas) or to any un-even number of brahmanas. (Food should be given) to an even number on auspicious occasions 820 

817. अन्वष्टक्य is explained by रुद्रस्कन्द on खादिरगृह्य III. 5. as 'अष्टकामनु क्रियते इत्यन्वष्टक्यं कर्म एतच्च प्रत्यष्टकमनन्तरं कर्तव्यम्! and by देवपाल on काठकगृह्म

820. 'Výddhi' or "Ābhyudayika" (referring to prosperity or good luck) Srāddha is performed on such occasions as the birth of a cour, the marriage of a son or daughter, the pitrs in the Vrddhi-Sraddha being design ated Nandimukha. Purta means charitable works such as construction of wells and tanks, building of temples, dedication of parks. Vide Bibh. vol. II. p. 844 n. 1992 and Yāj. I. 250, San. Gr. IV. 4. 1 ff.

or on the performance of meritorious deeds; to an uneven number on other occasions). The rite is performed from left to right. Barley grains are to be used instead of sesamum. 

The Anvastakya rite was performed after each of the three or four Astakās and if only one Astaka in Māgha were perform ed, then after the 8th of the dark half. 

There are two views about the rite called Māghyāvarsa 821 in Āśv. Gr. II, 5.9. Acc. to Nārāyana, the rite is performed in the dark half of Bhādrapada for three days on 7th, 8th and 9th.822 The other view is that it is a rite like the Astakās but performed on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada, when generally the moon is in the Maghā naksutra. There is doubt about the very name of the rite, as the mss. present various forms (vide Oldenberg's note in S. B. E. vol. 29. p. 103 on Sān, Gr. III. 13. 1). The real name appears to be Māghyāvarsa or Maghāvarṣa (meaning 'a śrāddha in the rainy season when the moon is in the Maghā nakṣatra)'. The Viṣnu Dh, S. 76. 1 823 mentions the following times for offering śrāddha viz, (twelve) Amāvāsyās (in a year), the three Astakās, the three Anvastakās, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada when the moon is in the Maghā asterism, the seasons of śarad and vasanta. In Visnu Dh. S. (78.52-53) also a śrāddha on the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada is highly eulogised. Manu III. 273 also states that whatever food mixed with honey is offered on the 13th day in the rainy season when the moon is in Maghā procures endless satisfaction. To the same effect are Vas. XI, 40 (in the rainy season and on Maghā), Yaj. I. 26 and Varāhapurāṇa,824 In the

Hir. Gr. II, 13. 3-4 (edited by Kirste) the name appears to be Madhyāvarsa 825 and it is provided that meat is obligatory in it, but that if meat cannot be had then vegetables may be offered, In Pār, 826 Gr. (III. 3) the name (as printed) is madhyāvarsa which is said to be a 4th Astakā in which only vegetables are offered. Aparārka (p. 422) also appears to call the rite 'madhyā Varṣa.' In the Bhavisyapurāņa 827 (Brahma-parva), chap. 183. 4 also this rite is referred to but it is said that therein meat is to be offered. It appears probable that this ancient rite on the 13th of the dark half of Bhadrapads is a precursor of the Mahālayasrāddha of later times. 

If Āśvalāyana's view, viz. that there are four Astakās in Hemanta and Siśira, were followed and if the Māghyāvarsa śrāddha were to be performed on the 8th of the dark half of Bhādrapada as Nārāyana holds, then there would be five Astakās in all. Bhattoji in his Caturvimsatimatasangraha says 80.828 

Considerations of space forbid the comparison of the above procedure from Āp. Gr. and Āśv. Gļ. with the procedure described in the other Grhyasūtras. It should be noted that several of the sūtras often employ the same mantras in the various stages of the rite (ag pointed out above in notes 813-814). 

It must be said that the Astakā śrāddhas gradually fell into oblivion and are not performed now.

which the Astakās and other srāddhas were copies (vikrtis ) with suitable modifications, though a few dissident texts reverse the position, 

In the Gobhilagphya (IV. 4. 3 ff) another śrāddha called *Anvāhārya' is prescribed after the Pindapitryajña on the same day. The Sān. Gr. IV. 1. 13 appears also to describe the monthly śrāddha as distinct from the Pindapitryajña. Manu (III.122-23) states: 'After performing the Pitryajña (i. e, piņdapitryajña) a brāhmaṇa who keeps sacred fires shall offer every month on the amāvāsyā day the funeral sacrifice Piņdānvāhāryaka. 829 The wise call the monthly offering to the Manes Anvāhārya and that must be carefully performed with the approved kinds of flesh mentioned below.' From this it appears that one who has consecrated the frauta fires (i.e. an āhitāgni) was to perform the pindapitryajfa in the grauta fires and also perform the same day another sraddha after the pindapitryajña, while those who had not consecrated srauta fires were to perform on amāvāsyā a sraddha in the gphya fire, which was called piņdānvāhār yaka or simply anyāhārya and also were to offer pindapitr yajña in smārta fire (vide Sat. Srauta II. 7. 64 'grhyāgnau anāhitāgneh'). From inquiries made I learn that nowadays most Agnihotrins (at least in the Deccan) do not perform Pinda pitryajña at all or perform it only once a year and that no one performs the Pindānvāhāryaka śrāddha. It is further to be noted that in smārta yajñas no one now sacrifices an animal but employs instead māṣa grain and there are āhitāgnis who do not offer meat in srauta sacrifices also, but only piṣta-pasu (an effigy of an animal made of flour). 

The literature on śrāddha is enormous in extent. From the Vedic Samhitās several thousand years ago up to medieval and modern commentaries and digests the various matters connect ed with śrāddha have been dealt with in more or less detail. The Purāṇas contain thousands of verses on śrāddha, An

adequate and thorough treatment of all this vast mass would fill a separate volume, but considerations of space forbid such an attempt here. All that can be attempted here at the most (and that too not in all cases) is to present matters chronologi cally i. e. describe how śrāddha was dealt with in the Samhitās and Brāhmaṇa texts, then in the comparatively older Gphya and Dharma sūtras, then in such early smftis as those of Manu and Yāj., then in some representative Purāpas, then in the early commentaries of Medhātithi, Vijñānesvara and Aparārka, and then in the medieval digests. Even in this way only a skeleton of the ceremonies described in some representative work of each class can be exhibited. Many differences of detail which arose owing to lapse of time, the locality, the sākhā and usages of each writer, his individual inclination and his ability, will have to be passed over altogether. In the days of the Purānas the differences in detail in the several sākhās have been adverted to.829a Apart from the smrtis and passages of the Mahābhārata (such as Anusāsana chap. 87-92) and com mentaries on the Sūtras, on Manu, Yāj. and other smitis, the digests on śrāddha are legion. Only the following digests (arranged in chronological order) have been laid under contri bution in this volume: Kalpataru on śrāddha; the Hāralatā and Pitrday itā of Aniruddha; the Smrtyarthasāra; the Smrticandrikā; the Caturvargacintamani (section on śrāddha) of Hemādri (which in the B. I. edition covers 1716 pages); the Śrāddhaviveka of Rudradhara; the Madanapārijāta ; the Srāddhasāra (a part of Nrsimhaprasāda); Srāddhakriya-kaumudi of Govindānanda ; the Srāddhatattva of Raghunandana ; the Srāddhasaukhya (part of Todarānanda); the Śrāddhakalpalatā of Vinayaka alias Nandapandita; the Nirnayasindhu; the Sraddhamayükha of Nilakantha; the Srāddhaprakāśa (part of Viramitrodaya); the Śrāddhacandrika of Divākarabhatta ; the Smrtimuktāphala (on śrāddha); the Dharmasindhu; the Bālambhatti, a commentary on the Mitākṣarā. While presenting this exhaustive and hetero. geneous material, some generalisations, when called for, will be made here and there. It will be seen later on how several minor matters such as whether food should be offered to gods before śrāddha, definitions of words like parivitti, vrsalipati increased the extent of treatises on śrāddha.

[Vol. 

We should now turn to the several matters relating to šrāddhas. 

First comes the question as to who are entitled to offer srāddha (śrāddhādhikārin). This matter has been already dealt with in the H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 739 ff., and on page 763 and on pp. 256-261 (notes 581-588) above. It would be noticed that some (like the Visnudharmasūtra ) prescribe that whoever takes the wealth of the deceased should offer pindas (i, e. per form śrāddha for him), while others said that whoever was preferable as entitled to offer pindas to the deceased propositus was to take the wealth. A few matters not mentioned there may be added here. In the Santiparva 65, 13-21 it is narrated830 that emperor Māndhātr was told by Indra how Yavanas, Kirātas and similar non-Aryan peoples (that are styled Dasyus in the Epic) are to be made to conduct themselves and it is stated that all dasyus may perform Pitryajñas (in which they should feed men of their own kind and make monetary gifts to them) and offer money to brāhmaṇas also. The Vāyupurāṇa (83. 112) also speaks of the Mlecchas as persons that offer oblations to Pitrs. The general rule is stated by the Gobhila smrti 831 that the husband should not offer pipda to his wife even if she dies sonless, nor a father to his son nor an elder brother to a younger brother. The moral of the story of Ninii who performed śrāddha for his predeceased son and repented for having done so as it was dharmasankara is the same. Vide Anušāsanaparva 91. Aparārka (p. 538) quotes a verse from Saţtrimsan-mata that a father should not perform the śrāddha of his son nor an elder brother of a younger one. But Br̥hat parāśara (p. 153) appears to state that even this general rule may have to be set aside sometimes. Baudhāyana and VỊddhaśātātapa (q. by Sm. C, on śrāddha p. 337) allow a śrāddha (except sapiņdikarana) to be performed by any one for any

relative through affection, particularly at Gayā. It is emphas ized 832 that he alone deserves to be called putra, who, while the father is alive, obeys his words, and gives plenty of food (to brāhmanas) every year (after his father's death) and who offers pindas (to his ancestors) at Gayā. The general rule laid down was that a child, whose upanayana has not been performed, is like a südra and lacks authority to utter Vedic passages (vide Āp. Dh. S, II, 6. 15. 19, Gaut. II, 4-5, Vas. II. 6, Viṣnu Dh. S. 28. 40. Manu II, 172).833 But an exception was recognized by almost all these authorities that a son, though his upanayana may not have been performed, can repeat the Vedic mantras required in funeral rites. Medhatithi on Manu II, 172 explains that a minor son, even though not initiated into Vedic study by upanayana, can offer water to his father, perform the navaśrāddhas (mentioned above in n. 593) and repeat such mantras as sundhantām pitarah' required in these rites, but since he has no srauta or grhya fire of his own he can not per form such śrāddhas as the pārvana. The Smrtyarthasara (p. 56) provides that boys whose upanayana has not been per formed, women and südras should get śrāddhas performed through a priest or they may themselves perform them without mantras but only mention the name and gotra of the deceased or with the two mantras 'devebhyo namah' and 'pitrbhyah svadhā namah'. The above discussion shows that men and women, adults as well as children, those who are upanita as well as those that are anupanāta are under an obligation to per form śrāddha. 

Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I. 6.9 (which will be quoted later on) show that srāddha was offered to three immediate ancestors, father, grand-father, great-grand-father. The Baud. Dh. S. (I. 5. 113-115) states that there is a group of seven persons closely knit together that is called avibhaktadāya sapindas viz. great-grand-father, grand-fathsr, father, the man himself (who

Visņu Dh. S. 15. 46 ) solemnly 835 affirms: 'by (the birth of) a son a man wins the worlds (heaven &c.), he secures immor tality by a grandson and by the grandson of a son he reaches the abode of the Sun'. This verse shows that all the three descendants of a person confer equally great spiritual benefit on him. Yāj. also (in 1. 78) lumps the three together (without making any distinction between them) when he says since a man securos perpetuation of lineage and heaven by means of son, grand-son and great-grand-son'. Therefore when Manu (IX. 106 ) says that by the birth of a son a man discharges his debt to his progenitors the Dāyabhāga (XI. 34) explains that the word putra stands for the three descendants up to the great grandson, since all the three are entitled to perform the pār vana-śrāddha and equally benefit the ancestors by the pindas they offer, and that the word putra is not to be taken literally but only as illustrative in order to include the great-grandson since one may with difficulty find a text expressly mentioning the adhikāra of the grandson (as a performer of śrāddha and taker of wealth) but there is no text expressly mentioning the great-grandson separately (as the taker of wealth and giver of piņda ) 836. On Yāj. II. 50 which lays down that when the father dies or has gone to a distant country or is overwhelmed by calamities (incurable diseases or the like) his debts should be paid by the sons or grandsons, the Mit. adds that even when a son or grandson receives no ancestral property the father's debts must be paid, the only difference being that the son has to pay the principal as well as the interest, while the grandson

has to return only the principal and has to pay no interest and the Mit. quotes a verse of Brhaspati 837 where all the three descendants are mentioned in one breath and the Mit. adds that the great-grandson has not to pay even the principal if he has received no ancestral property. This last remark implies that the Mit, regarded that the great-grandson was also included in the extended sense of 'putra'. Yāj. II. 51 begins by saying that whoever takes the wealth of a deceased person has to pay the latter's debts, so the great-grandson would have to pay the great-grand-father's debts if he received the assets of the grand-father. Therefore the Mit. on II. 50 expressly mentions that a great-grandson need not pay his great-grand-father's debts if he received no assets, because, otherwise being included in the extended meaning of putra, he would have had to pay. There was no necessity to bring in or mention the prapautra under II. 50 if the Mit. did not include the prapautra in the word putra. Again on Yāj. II. 51 ('putrahinasya rikthinaḥ') the Mit. included even prapautra under the word putra. This shows that the Mit. is quite conscious that the three descendants of a man form one group and succeed to his estate and liabilities and putra includes three descendants wherever the context so requires. If the word 'putra' is not to be taken as only illustrative and as including both grandson and great-grandson, serious difficulties will arise even in the interpretation of Yaj. on which the Mit. comments. For example, in Yāj. II. 135-136 it is said that when a gonless man dies his wife, daughters and other heirs (named there ) succeed one after another. If ‘putra' is taken to mean only son' and no one else, then on the death of a man without a son his wife or daughter (whoever is alive ) will take the wealth even if a son's son exists. But that would be absurd and is not stated by any one. Therefore the word putra has to be interpreted in a wider sense in a proper context. Many works such as the Vyavahāramayukha, the Viramitrodaya, the Dattakamimāngā interpret the word 'putra' as including three generations. Therefore, though the Mit. in its remarks on inheritance and succession expressly names the son and grand

son only (lit. it should have mentioned only the son) it must be taken as including the great-grandson also, particularly in view of the fact that it refers to the great-grandson in its comment on Yāj. I, 50 and 51 as taking the riktha which the Mit. (on Yāj. II, 114) interprets as aptratibandha dāya. Baud., Manu, Yājñavalkya speak of the three descendants and Sankha likhita, Vas. XI. 39 and Yama employ 838 only the word putra or suta in relation to the three ancestors. Therefore, the remark of Dr. Kapadia in 'Hindu Kinship'on p. 162 Vijñāne śvara understands by the word putra sons and grandsong only! is unjustified. It is impossible to hold with Dr. Kapadia that the Mit. ran counter to the express dicta of renowned Smrtis such as those of Manu, Sankha-Likhita and Puranas like the Viṣnu-purāpa III. 13,30 (quoted above in note 582) and that in its remarks on succession it forgot its own interpretation of putra on Yaj. II. 51. He has also not correctly understood the words of the Mit, introducing Yāj. II. 137: 'sons and grandsons take the wealth; in their absence, the wife and others; thus it is said (by me). This is wrong for several reasons. "Wife and others take the wealth' is said by Yāj. (in II. 135-36). The following words are 'now (the author) declares an exception to both.' This clearly refers to Yāj. (II. 137) and not to Vijñāne śyara and so 'uktam' also must refer to Yāj. and not to Vijñāneśvara. Therefore, according to the Mit, the great-grand son is included in the extended meaning of the word 'putra', is entitled just like a son or a grandson to offer śrāddha (in default of a son or grandson) and to take the wealth and pay the debts of the ancestor. In the matter of payment of debts there is, on account of the difference in the period that elapses, a difference between all the three descendants if no ancestral wealth is left by the ancestor, viz. the son pays the debt with interest, the grandson only the principal lent but without interest and the great-grandson nothing at all. This shows that even between the son and the grandson that are expressly mentioned by Yaj. * II. 50 as to the payment of debts there is a difference and that as the great-grandson had to pay nothing when no ancestral property existed he was not mentioned at all in Yāj.

Times for grāddhas

Just as the king is an ultimate heir and also the guardian of all minors, so he is like the son of a person (who has no relatives left) for performing śrāddhas. 

The next question is about the times when śrāddha is to be performed. It has been seen above (vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p. 696 ff) that long before the time of the Sat. Br. five daily observances (called Mahāyajñas) were prescribed for each house-holder, viz. the sacrifice to beings, that to men, that to the Fathers, that to the gods and that to Veda. The Sat. Br. and the Tai. Ā. (II. 10) say further that this daily rite in which one offers svadhā (food) to the Fathers even up to water was called pitryajña, Manu III. 70 defines pitryajña as tarpana (satiating ancestors with the offerings of water). Manu III. 82 provides that an householder should daily perform a srāddha with food or with water or with milk, roots and fruits and thus please the Fathers. Srāddha originally meant a sacrifice performed for the Fathers on Amāvāsyā (vide Gaut. 15.1-2).838a By applying that word to the daily oftering of water to the Manes what is intended to be conveyed is that the special characteristics of śrāddha in the strict sense are to be extended to this daily rite so far as possible. Amāvāsyā is of two kinds, Sinivāli and Kuhū. Those who keep srauta fires should perform śrāddha on the former, while those who have not kept srauta fires and südras should offer sraddha on the latter. 

Srāddhas are divided into three classes, nitya, naimittika and kāmya. An observance is called nitya when it is laid down that it must be performed on a certain or fixed occasion (such as every day, on an amāvāsyā, or on Aṣtakā day). What is laid down for being done on an occasion which is uncertain is called naimittika (such as the birth of a son). What is ordained to be done in case one desires a certain reward or fruit is called kāmya (e.g. the performance of a śrāddha on Kr̥ttikā or Rohiņi by one who desires heaven or progeny ). The five daily yajñas including pitr-yajña are nitya i. e. they must be per formed without any eye to any reward therefrom and the

non-performance thereof will lead to sinfulness. Passages mentioning the rewards that follow from the performance of obligatory ( nitya ) rites are only laudatory, they only convey that such performances make a man pure, but it is not meant that they are not obligatory and may be performed only if a person desires the rewards or results promised (i, e. such performances are not kāmya). Āp. Dh, S. (II. 7. 16. 4-7) provides certain times for the performance of śrāddha viz, that it must be performed in the latter half of every month, that the afternoon is preferable for it, that the last days of the latter half of each month are preferable to the first days of the latter half. Gaut, 15. 3 and Vas. XI. 16 say that śrāddha may be performed on any day of the dark half of a month after the 4th day and Gaut. 15. 5 adds that if particularly appro priate materials or particularly holy brāhmaṇas are available or the performer is near a very sacred place (such as Gaya) a śrāddha may be performed on any day. Kurma (II. 20. 23) says the same thing. The Agnipurāṇa 115. 8 says that at Gayā a srāddha may be performed on any day (na kālādi Gayātirthe dadyāt pindāśca nityasah). Manu (III, 276-278) provides that the days of the dark half of the month beginning with the 10th but excepting the 14th 838b are recommended for śrāddha, that one performing a śrāddha on even lunar days (i. e, on the 10th, 12th) and on the even nakṣatras (i. e. on Bharaṇī, Rohiņi &c.) gains the fulfilment of all his desires, that one who worships the Manes on uneven days (11th, 13th &c.) and on uneven constellations (Kr̥ttikā, Mrgasiras &c.) obtains pro sperous offspring and that just as the latter half of a month is 

838 b. About the 14th of the dark half op. I. 264 says 'ar racaat af Parcar zadataitaa gara daruraavaan; compare AT III.276; and atira states faarura Tafatema Tesi TEC Ti s i a rarearu q. by turaa. (X.) p. 367, purgata p. 191. rrraraaj here means arreur 

grareatata. This only means that sraddha should not be performed for anyone on the 14th of the dark half except for those who were killed by poison or by beasts, snakes, lower animals or brahmanas or in battle. But a srāddha may be performed on any tithi of the dark half for those killed in battle or by poison &c. It should be noted that Manu prescribes (III. 282) that an āhitāgni should not perform a sraddha except on darsa, from which it follows that only others (who had no srauta fires) could offer srāddha on any day of the dark half. Vide F actor VI, 204, 24-27 and VI. 219.19-21 for the proposition that srāddha should be performed on the 14th tithi of the dark "half of Bhadrapada for those who met a violent death by poisoning or forle For

preferable to the first half so the afternoon is preferable to the forenoon for the performance of a śrāddha. Anušāsanaparva 87. 18 is the same as Manu III. 276. Yāj. (I. 217-218), the Kurma (II 20.2-8), Mārkandeya (28. 20 ff) and Varāhapurāņa 13. 33–35 sum up in one place the times for performing śrāddhas as follows: Amāvāsyā, the Astakā days, lucky days (such as the birth of a son), dark half of a month, the two ayanas (the two days on which the sun appears to start towards the south or north i. e. solstices), possession of sufficient materials (such as rice and pulse or meat), the arrival of a worthy brāhmana, the equinoctial points (viṣuvat, i. e. the sun's apparent en trance into Aries and Balance), the days on which the sun passes into one rāśi from another, the astrological conjunctions called Vyatīpāta 838c, Gajacchāyā, eclipses of the sun and the moon, when the performer has an intense desire to perform śrāddha-these are times for performing śrāddha The Mārkan

Bana mentions Vyatipata in his हर्षचरित. व्यतीपात is also defined in another way with reference to Rasis. पञ्चाननस्थौ गुरुभूमिपुत्री मेषे रविः स्याद्यदि शुक्लपक्षे । पाशाभिधाना करभेन युक्ता तिथिय॑तीपात इतीह योगः॥. by श्रा.

deya 838d (chap. 28. 22-23), adds that śrāddha should be perform ed when a man dreams an evil dream and when evil planets affect the nakṣatra of his birth. In an eclipse the appropriate time for śrāddha is what is called Sparsa Kāla 839 (i. e. when the eclipse begins), as stated in a verse of VỊddha-Vasistha. The Brahmapurāṇa (220. 51-54) contains all the times specified by Yāj. and a few more. Vide also Skandapurāņa VII, 1. 30-32, Visnupurāņa TII, 14. 4-6, Padma (srsti 9. 128-129). Acc. to Viṣņu Dh. S. 76. 1-2, Amāvāsyā, the three Astakās and the three Anvastakās, the 13th day of the dark half of Bhādrapada on which the moon is in Maghā, Sarad and Vasanta are obliga tory (nitya) times for śrāddha and that if a person does not per form śrāddha on these days he goes to Hell. Visnu Dh, S. (77.1-7) states that the day of the sun's passage from one sign of the zo diac to another, the two equinoctial days, particularly the sols ticial days, Vyatipāta, the constellation on which the performer is born, a time of rejoicing (son's birth or the like )--these are kāmya times and a srāddha performed on these occasions gives infinite pleasure (to the Manes). The Kūrmapurāņa (Uttarārdha 16. 6-8) says that śrāddhas called kāmya are commended on eclipses, solstice days, equinoctial days and on Vyatipāta and they give infinite pleasure (to the Manos) and srāddha per formed on Sankranti (sun's passage from one sign of the zodiac to another) is inexhaustible and so also on days of birth and on the several nakṣatras śrāddhas should be performed. Ap. Dh, S. II. 7. 16. 8-22, Anusāsana 87, Vāyu 89. 10-19, Yāj. I 262-263. Brahmapurāņa 220.15-21, Viṣnu Dh.

These lists do not completely agree with each other. That of Ap. being probably the most ancient, is set out here:-Śrāddha performed on each of the 15 days of the dark half respectively yields the following results in order, viz. progeny chiefly consisting of females (on 1st tithi

Amāyāsyā). Gārgya (q. by Par. M. I. 2 p. 324) provides that one should not perform śrāddha on Nandā, on Friday, on 13th of the dark half and on the nakṣatra of birth and the preceding and the following nakṣatras for fear of losing one's sons and wealth. The Nandā tithis are 1st, 6th and 11th. The Anušāsana-parva (87.16) provides that he who performs śrāddha on the 13th tithi attains pre-eminence among his agnates, but then the young men in his house die as a consequence. 

The śrāddhas performed on the days mentioned in Viṣnu Dh, S. 77.1-6 are naimittika and those performed on certain tithis and days of the week for securing certain rewards would be kūmya śrāddhas. According to Par. M. I. 1 p. 63 the per formance of obligatory (nitya) actions is samskāraka (i. e. effects a purifying change in the mind making it fit for higher things ), while in some cases it may also produce the desire to know the Reality behind the appearances (i. e. it is 'vividisa janaka' as indicated by the Gitā 9. 27). Jaimini (VI. 3.1-7) establishes the proposition that the nitya acts (such as Agni hotra, Darsa-pürņamāsa-yāga ) must be performed even though the performer is unable to perform a subsidiary part of the rite; while Jai. VI. 3. 8-10 provide that every part of kāmya actions must be performed and if the performer thinks that he would be unable to perform all he should not undertake to perform a kāmya rite at all. 839a 

The Visnudharmasūtra (78.1-7) states that one performing srāddha on Sunday secures everlasting freedom from dis ease and those who perform śrāddha on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday (Jaiva ), Friday and Saturday respec

tively secure happiness (or admiration by people ), victory in battle, all desires, such learning as he desires, wealth and long life. The Kūrma (II. 20, 16-17) also expatiates on the rewards for śrāddhas on the several days of the week. 

The Viṣnu-Dharmasūtra (78. 8-15 ) mentions what rewards follow from performance of srāddhas on the 28 nakṣatras from Kr̥ttikā to Bharaṇi (including Abhijit which is placed after Uttarāṣāḍhā and before Śravaṇa). Yāj. I. 265-268, Vāyu chap. 82, Mārkandeya-purāṇa 30, 8-16, Kūrma (II, 20. 9-15), Brahmapurāņa 220, 33-42, Brahmānda ( Upodghātapāda 18.1 ff) also deal with the same topic, but all these works do not present complete agreement. For example, Visnu Dh. S. and Yāj. agree that śrāddha performed on Křttikā, Rohiņi, Aśvinī and Bharaṇī yield as rewards heaven, offspring, horses and longe vity, but they disagree in several others e. g. while Vispu says that prosperity, beauty (or happiness ) and all desires are obtained by performing śrāddha on the Pusya, Aśleṣā and Maghā nakṣatras respectively, Yāj. provides that a śrāddha on these three yields strength, son and eminence. The Anu sāsanaparva 89 and Vayupurāņa 82 set out the rewards of śrāddhas on the several nakṣatras from Kr̥ttikā as declared by Yama to Sasabindu. 

It is stated in the Agnipurāņa 840 that śrāddhas performed at a holy place and on days that are called Yugādi and Man vādi yield inexhaustible gratification (to the pitys). The Vispupurāṇa 841, Matsyapurāṇa (17. 4-5), Padma V. 9. 130-131, Varāhapurāṇa and Prajāpati-smrti verse 22 and Skanda VII, 1. 205, 33-34 state that the third tithi of Vaisakha (bright half), the 9th of the bright half of Kārtika, the 13th of the dark half of Bhādrapada and 15th tithi of the dark half of Māgha are called Yugādi tithis (i. e. the first days of the four Yugas from Kịta).

Visņu Dh. S. declares that śrāddha performed during an eclipse satisfies the Manes as long as the moon and stars exist and brings to the performer all advantages and the satisfaction of all his desires, while the Kūrmapurāņa threatens that he who would not perform a sraddha in an eclipse sinks (incurs sins or becomes ruined) as a cow in mud. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 217 is careful to point ont that though there is a prohibition against eating during the progress of an eclipse of the sun or moon, that prohibition would only affect the eater (the brāhmaṇa who eats śrāddha repast in an eclipse) but not the giver who will secure happiness (or good results ) thereby.843

Very learned disquisitions are held in Aparārka p. 465 ff, Hemādri p. 313 ff and other writers and digests as to the mean ing of aparāhna which is the time for sraddha prescribed by Manu (III. 278). There are several views. Some hold that the part of the day after noon is 'after-noon.' The word 'purvāhna' occurs in Rg. X. 34. 11. Others relying on a śruti 844 text 

The forenoon is for gods, mid-day for men and afternoon for pitěs' hold that the third part of the day divided into three parts is 'aparāhọa.' A third view is that aparāhna is the 4th part of the day divided into five parts and they rely 845 on Sat. Br. II. 2.3.9. The five parts are called pratah, saigava, madhyandina (or madhyahna), aparahna and sayahna (or sayam or astagamana). The first three are expressly mentioned even in the Rgveda V. 76. 3. Prajāpati-snirti (verses 156-157) says that each of these five parts extends over three muhurtas (the day being divided into fifteen muhūrtas). It further states that kutapa is the 8th muhūrta from sunrise and that srāddha should be begun in kutapa and should not last beyond Rauhina muhūrta and that five muhurtas (from 8th to 12th) are the maximum time for śrāddha, 846 The word kutapa has eight meanings as noted by the Sm. c. (śrāddha) p. 433 and Hemādri on śrāddha p. 320. The word is derived from ku' meaning 'condemned' (i.e.sin) and 'tapa' means 'what burns.' The eight 847 meanings of 'kutapa' are 'midday, a vessel of rhinoceros horn, woollen seat or blanket

from Nepal, silver, darbhas, sesame, cows and daughter's son.' The general rule is that srāddhas are performed in the afternoon (but this applies to śrāddha on New moon, Mahālaya, Astakā and Anvastakā śrāddhas ), while Vrddhiếrāddha and śrāddha in which only corn is offered (āmaśrāddha) are performed in the morning. Medhātithi on Manu III. 245 quotes a smrti text on this. 848 The Trikāpdamandana (II. 150, 162) provides that when it is not possible to perform a religious rite at the time prescribed for it as appropriate, it should be performed at some other time thereafter and that, between the proper time of a rite and the means, the former is to be preferred and one should not wait for a time later than the proper one with the desire of being able to collect all the principal materials. 848a 

A few words must be said about the proper places for the performance of a śrāddha. Manu (III, 206-207 ) lays down that the performer should make efforts to secure a spot sloping to the south and smear it with cow dung, a spot that is pure and unfrequented by many persons) and that the Fathers are pleased by śrāddha at naturally clean spots or the banks of rivers and spots that are unfrequented. Yāj. I. 227 very briefly puts the requirements by saying that the place of śrāddha should be covered on all sides, should be pure and sloping to the south. Sankha says : 849 one should not perform śrāddha on the backs of bulls, elephants and horses, nor on raised earth platforms nor on land owned by others.' The Kūrmapurāņa states 850 'Forests. sacred mountains, holy places, temples-these have no (definite) owner and they cannot be private property (of any one )'. Yama provides 851 if one offers sraddha to his pitrs in spots

belonging to others, that śrāddha rite is destroyed by the pitrs of the owner of those spots. Therefore, a man should perform srāddha on holy spots, on river banks, in sacred places and particularly in land belonging to himself, in bowers near hills and on mountain tops.' The Viṣnudharma-sūtra chap. 85 mentions numerous holy places and then adds in these and other tirthas, big rivers, on all natural sandy banks, near streams, on mountains, in bowers, forests, groves and spots that look charming because of being smeared with cowdung ( sraddha may be performed ).' Sankha (14. 27–29 ) states 'whatever is given in holy Gayā, in Prabhāsa, Puṣkara, Prayāga, in the Naimisa forest (on the Sarasvati), on the banks of the Ganges, Yamunā, Payosni, on Amarakantaka, on Narmadā, in Benares, in Kuruksetra, Bhrgutunga, on the Himalaya, on Sapta-Veni, on Rṣikūpa--all that becomes inex haustible.' The Brahmapurāpa ( 220.5-7) also specifies river banks, lakes, mountain tops, sacred spots like Puskara as the proper places for sraddha. The Vāyupurāṇa, chap. 77 and Matsya 22 contain long lists of sacred places, countries, moun tains in relation to śrāddhas. The Kalpataru (srāddha p. 40) and Sr. P. p. 147 state that special characteristics of the tirthas in the several countries that are declared to be fit places for śrāddha should be understood from the inhabitants of those various countries. 

Sacred places will be dealt with in a separate section (on tirthas ). 

The Viṣnudharmasūtra 852 ( chap. 84 ) prescribes that srāddha should not be performed in Mleccha country, nor should one go to a Mleccha country and then defines a Mleccha country as one in which the system of the four varnas is not established and states that Aryāvarta is beyond that. The Vāyupurāṇa provides 853 that the country of Trisanku which is

twelve yojanas in extent and which is to the north of the river Mahanadi and to the south of Kikata (i. e. Magadha ) is not fit for sraddha; similarly the countries called Kāraskara, Kalinga, the country to the north of the river Sindhu and all countries where the system of varnas and āśramas is not in existence should be sedulously avoided for śrāddhas, The Brahmapurāṇa (220.8-10) makes the somewhat startling remark that the following countries should be avoided for śrāddhas viz, the Kirāta country, Kalinga, Konkapa, Krimi (Krivi?), Daśārņa, Kumārya (Cape Comorin), Tangapa, Kratha, the northern banks of the Sindhu river and the south bank of Narmadā and the east of the Karatoyā. 

The Markandeyapurāņa 854 prescribes that for a śrāddha a place (ground) that is full of insects, that is arid, or is burnt by fire, from which proceed sounds that are painful to the ear, that is terrific in its aspect, that emits fetid smell should be avoided. 

It was also provided from very early times that certain persons and animals are to be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be performed and are not to be allowed to pollute the śrāddha rite by looking at it or by disturbing it in various other ways. Gaut. (15. 25-28) provides that food seen by dogs, capdalas and those guilty of mahāpātakas becomes unclean (and so unfit); therefore one should offer śrāddha in a covered (or screened) place; or he should strew round about the place sesame or a worthy brāhmaṇa who purifies a row of diners by his presence should perform a sānti for removing the taint caused (by a dog or cāņdāla seeing the food &c). Ap. Dh. S, prescribes that the learned condemn the seeing of a śrāddha by dogs and those who (being palita) are excommunicated and that a leper, a bald man, one having sexual intercourse with another's wife, the son of a brālmaņa who follows the profes sion of arms, the son of a brāhmana woman from a südra man if these eat śrāddha food they pollute the diners sitting to eat in a row. Manu (III. 239-242) states: a candāla, a village pig or cock, a dog, a woman in her monthly illness, an impotent person-these should not be allowed to see brāhmapas engaged in taking dinner. Whatever is seen by these at a homa

A pig taints food ( offered to gods or Manes) by merely smelling it, a cock by setting in motion the air with its wings, a dog by casting a glance and a man of low caste by touch. If a servant of even the person who offers srāddha is lame or squint-eyed or has a limb loss or more (i. e. having eleven or nine fingers &c.), he should be ejected from the place where śrāddha is to be per formed.' It is provided by the Anušāsanaparva (127.13) that śrāddha food should not be seen by a woman in her monthly illness or by a sonless woman or by one suffering from white leprosy. Viṣnu-dharmasutra (82, 3 ff) contains a long list of about 30 persons who are not to be allowed near a śrāddha. The Kūrmapurāņa (II. 22. 34-35 ) states that one devoid of a limb, a patita, a leper, one suffering from an open ulcer, an atheist, a cock, a pig, a dog, should be kept far away from a śrāddha; one should also avoid one that has a disgusting appearance, an impure person, one who is naked, a mad man, a gambler, a woman in her monthly course, those that wear indigo-coloured or yellow-red garments and those who follow heretical views. The Mārkandeya 32. 20-24, Vāyu 78. 26-40, Visnupurāṇa III. 16. 12-14 and Anušāsanaparva 91. 43-44 also contain long lists which are passed over here.

Classification of śrāddhas 

381 

pati quoted in the Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara mentions five classes of Sraddhas as declared by Manu viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, Vrddhi and Pārvana 856. The Srāddhaviveka remarks that the sixteen pretašrāddhas (to be described later on) are included under naimittika and that such śrāddhas as Gosthi śrāddha enumerated in other smrtis are included in Pārvana. The Kurmapurana (II. 20.26) similarly speaks of the five śrāddhas as enumerated by Manu 857. The Mit on Yãi. I. 217 states that there are five srāddhas, viz. "ahar-ahah-śrāddha, parvana, vrddhisraddha, ekoddista and sapindikarana. The daily sraddha is described by Manu IIL.82 ( Sankha 13.16 and Matsya 16.4) as one that is performed every day with food (cooked rice, yavas &c.) or with water or with milk, fruits and roots. Two verses of Viśvāmitra858 quoted by several works speak of twelve kinds of śrāddhas, viz. nitya, naimittika, kāmya, věddhi-śrāddha (performed on the birth of a son, 

marriage or similar incident of good luck), sapindana (sapindi karana), parvana, gosthisraddha, suddhisraddha, karmānga, daivika, yātrāśrāddha, pustiśrāddha. Explanations of all these are quoted from the Bhavisyapurāņa by the same works. Sapindana and Pārvana will be described below. Some of the rest not already defined may be briefly explained as follows: The Gosthi-srāddha 859 is one which is performed when a man be

The कल्पतरु refers to two verses of the recrut for explaining E gg which are quoted at length in श्रा. क्रि. कौ. p. 267 and श्रा. प्र. p. 333.

comes enthusiastic owing to a talk about sraddha or when many learned men gather together at a sacred place and, finding it impossible to have separate cooking arrangements for each, pool their resources for collecting śrāddha materials and perform simultaneously śrāddha for the pleasure it affords to themselves and for the gratification of pitrs. The Suddhi śrāddha is one where brāhmanas are fed when a person under goes śuddhi ( purification) after being guilty of some sin or transgression (it is a subsidiary act in a prāyaścitta). That srāddha is called 'karmānga' which is performed at the time of the Garbhādhāna rite or at the performance of a soma sacrifice, or at simantonnayana, pumsavana (it is like Vrddhisrāddha ). That is called daivika śrāddha which is intended to propitiate gods ( it is like nityagrāddha and is performed on the 7th or 12th tithi or the like with sacrificial food). When a man going to a distant country on a pilgrimage or the like performs a srāddha in which clarified butter is served ( to brāhmapas ) in abundance or when he comes back to his house, that is yātra srāddha. That is called pustiśrāddha which is performed for the health (or fattening ) of the body (when taking some medicine for the purpose ) or for the increase of one's wealth. Out of these 860 twelve the principal ones are pārvana, ekoddi ṣta, vrddhi and sapindana. There are works called Şan-navati-śrāddha such as those of Sivabhatta, son of Govinda, and of Raghunātha. The 96 śrāddhas to be performed in a year are briefly enumerated in a verse 861 quoted in the note. They are: 12 srāddhas on

the 12 amāvāsyās in the year, the four srāddhas on the Yugādi days (note 841 above), the fourteen śrāddhas on the Manvantarādi days (p. 375 above), the śrāddhas on 12 sankrāntis (i. e. the sun's apparent motion from one sign of the Zodiac to another), the 13 grāddhas on the Yoga called Dhrti (i. e. Vaidhrti) and the 13 śrāddhas on the Vyatipāta yoga, the 16 Mahalaya śrāddhas, the four Anvaṣtakā days (according to Ašv. as noted on pp. 359-360), the four Astakā days and the four days (i.e. 7th of dark half of the months of Hemanta and Sisira) of the day previous (to the Astakā). These classifications and enumerations of śrāddhas will afford an idea how the doctrine of śrāddhas was carried to an exaggerated extent in the course of centuries. It goes without saying that only a few people could have indulged in the luxury of so many sraddhas a year and most people were content with the performance of only one Mahālayaśrāddha and one or two more. It may be noted that Manu (III. 122) first prescribed that on the amāvāsyā of each month an elaborate grāddha should be performed, but knowing that this was almost impossible Manu recommends to all (III. 281) that an elaborate sraddha should be performed on three amāvāsyās in one year 862 (viz. in Hemanta, Grisma and Varșa ) and one should perform every day the sraddha which is one of the five daily sacrifices (III. 82-83). Devala went further and recommended that an elaborate śrāddha may be performed only once a year. 

The next important question is about the qualifications of the brāhmaṇas that were invited to dinner on a śrāddha day. Only brāhmaṇas were and are entitled to be invited for śrāddha

dinner whoever may be the performer of the śrāddha. In this connection many works contain high eulogies of brāhmanas, but they are passed over here, as the eulogy of brāhmanas has been already dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 37-38, 135-138. It may be noted that the gļhyasūtras contain a few requirements, but as we proceed the smrtis and purāṇas go on adding qualifications and enlarging the lists of those that should not be invited. For example, the Āśv. Gr. 862a IV. 7.2, San, Gr. IV.1. 2, Ấp, G. VIII. 21. 2, Ấp. Dh, S, II, 7. 17. 4, Hir. Gr. II, 10.2, Baud. Gr. II. 10. 5-6 and II. 8. 2-3, Gaut. 15.9 provide that the brāhmaṇas to be invited should be possessed of Vedic learning, should be of excellent character (free from anger and passion and possessed of control of mind and senses) and of meritorious conduct, pure, not deficient in a limb or not having an excessive limb (e. g. having six fingers). The Ap. Dh. S. states that he who has studied the three Vedic verses in which the word 'madhu' occurs (Rg. I. 90.6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27-29. Tai, S. IV. 2.9.3), he who has studied the Trisuparna, one who is a Triņāciketa, one who has studied the mantras required for the four sacrifices (Aśvamedha, Puruṣamedha, Sarvamedha and Pitsmedha ) or who has performed these four sacrifices, one who keeps the five fires, he who knows the Sāman called Jyestha, he who carries out the duty of daily Vedic study, the son of one

who has studied the Veda and is able to teach the whole Veda with its angas, a śrotriya--these persons sanctify the company if they eat at a funeral repast. Gaut. 15. 28, Baud. Dh. S. II, 8.2, Manu III. 185-186, Yāj. I. 219, Varahapurāṇa 14.2 contain almost the same words about those who sanctify the company of diners (i. e. who are pankti pāvana). The Anusāsanaparva (90.25-31), Kūrmapurāṇa II. 21.1-14, Matsya 16. 7-13, Brahmapurāṇa 220. 101-104, Vāyu 79.56-59 and 83.5R-55, Skanda VI. 217. 21-25 give long lists of pankti pāvana brāhmaṇas. The Hir. Gr. II. 10.2, Baud, Dh. S. II. 2. 7, Kūrma (II. 21. 14) and others say that a performer of śrāddha should invite one who is not a relative connected by marriage (such as a maternal uncle) nor one who is of the same gotra, nor one who is connected with the performer by Veda study (i. e. is his teacher or pupil), nor a friend nor one who expects monetary help from the performer. Manu (IIT, 138-139) provides that one should not invite at a śrāddha dinner a personal friend, that one may gain a friend by making valuable gifts to him (on other occasions), that one should feed at a śrāddha a brāhmana whom he does not deem either his friend or foe and that he who performs srāddhas and offer ings to gods chiefly to gain friends reaps no reward after death by those grāddhas or offerings. But Manu III. 144 (= Kūrma II, 21-22) provides that one may invite even a friend but not a foe though the latter may be learned. Manu (III. 135-137 and 145-147 ) lays down that the main or best rule to be followed is to present śrāddha food to those who are devoted to spiritual knowledge, that between a man who has studied one whole recension of the Veda but whose father was not a śrotriya and one who is himself not a śrotriya but whose father had studied a whole recension of the Veda (i. e.whose father was a śrotriya) the latter is the more worthy of the two, that one should strive to feed at a śrāddha an adherent of the Rgveda who has studied one entire recension of that Veda or a follower of the Yajurveda who has studied one Sakhā thereof or a singer of sāmans who has finished one recension of the Sāmaveda and that if one of these preceding three is honoured and dines at a śrāddha, the ancestors of the performer will be gratified up to the seventh generation for a very long time. Harita (q. by Hemādri on grāddha p. 392 and Kalpataru on śr. pp. 66-67) describes the qualifications of those who are pānkteya brāhmaṇasyiz, they must be born in a high family (possessing four characteri stics), must be endowed with learning ( of six kinds ) and sila

(character of 13 kinds) and good conduct (of 16 kinds). Sankha Likhita 863 give a long list of pānkteya (fit to be associated with in a pankti i. e. row of diners) brāhmaṇas, viz, he who knows the Veda and the Vedāngas (viz. phonetics, kalpa or srauta ritual, grammar, Nirukta, metrics and astronomy); one who keeps the five fires; one who has studied the Veda with its angas; one who knows Sankhya, Yoga, Upaniṣads and Dharma śāstra; a śrotriya, a triņāciketa, trimadhu, trisuparņaka and one that has studied Jyesthasāman; one who has studied Sankhya, Yoga, Upaniṣads and Dharmaśāstra; who is devoted to Veda; who always keeps sacred fires; who is obedient to his parents and devoted to Dharmaśāstra. Similar rules are laid down by Visnu Db. S. 83, Br̥hat-Parāśara p. 150, Vrddha-Gau tama p. 581, Prajāpati verses 70-72, Laghu-Śatātapa verses 99 100, Aušanasasmrti (Jiv. vol. I. pp. 523-524). As Medhatithi 864 on Manu III 147 says the gist of all these passages is that a learned brāhmana who has studied the Veda, whose conduct is good, whose family is famous, who is the son of a śrotriya father and who is not related to the performer must be invited and all the rest is mere arthavāda (by way of eulogy). Manu (III. 128) laid down two propositions viz, all food offered as sacrifice to the gods and manes must be given only to a brāh mapa who studies the Veda and that whatever is presented to the most worthy brāhmaṇa (among brāhmaṇas studying the Veda) brings in the greatest rewards. Then Manu (III. 183) declares that panktipāvana brāhmaṇas are those that sanctify a row of diners among whom sit some who are tainted by (latent) blemishes that make them unfit to be among the diners. Then Manu (III. 184-186) gives examples of panktipāvana brāh manas viz, those who are the foremost among students of all the Vedas or their expository works and who are born in a family of unbroken descant of Vedic students, who are Trinā ciketa &c. Hemādri (on śr, pp. 391-395) and Kalpataru (śr. pp. 64-65) quote numerous verses from Yama on panktipāvana. 

Manu III, 147 asserts that the best course is to invite a brāhmana who fulfils the conditions laid down in Manu III.

132-146, but adds that if it is not possible to secure such a brāhmana then the next best course 865 (anukalpa') may be followed, viz. the performer may invite his own maternal grand father, his maternal uncle, sister's son, father-in-law, his teacher of the Veda, daughter's son, son-in-law, a bandhu (such as mother's sister's son), wife's brother or a sagotra, or his family priest, or his pupil. Similar provisions occur in Yāj. I. 220, Kūrma (Uttarārdha 21. 20), Varāhapurāņa 14. 3, Matsya 16. 10-11, Visnupurāņa III. 15. 2-4 (anukalpeṣvanantaran). But Manu is careful 866 to point out in a later chapter that one who is able to observe the best course, but observes the second best does not reap other-worldly rewards by his actions. Even Āp. Dh, S. 867 expressly says that if strangers do not possess the requisite qualifications, then even one's full brother possessed of all the qualifications (as to Vedic learning, good conduct &c.) and pupils may be fed at a śrāddha. Baud. Dh. S. also allows even a sapiņda to be fed. 868 Gaut. 15. 20 appears to be of the view that even pupils and sagotras may be invited when they are possessed of excellent qualities and strangers with good qualifications are not available. Even in these times very learned brāhmanas are un willing to be fed at a śrāddha, particularly within a few years (three or five ) from the death of the person for whose benefit the śrāddha is to be performed. Smrtis attach a certain stigma to the fact of being the recipient of a śrāddha dinner and prāyaścittas are prescribed. For example, the Mit, on Yāj. III. 289 quotes several verses of Bhāradvāja, one of which says "If a brāhmana dines at a pārvaņa śrāddha he has to perform six prāņāyāmas (as expiation), if he dines at a śrāddha from the third month after a person's death to one year, he has to undergo a fast; if he dines at a yrddhisrāddha, he has to per form three prāņāyāmas, and a fast for a day and night if he dines at a sapindana śrāddha.' The Mit. further quotes a

verse from Dhaumya which prescribes Cāndrāyana for dining at a śrāddha on the birth of a son or at simantonnayana, in a pavagrāddha eto. Vide also Nirnayasindhu III, pp. 467-468 for prāyascittas on eating srāddha dinners, The Varāhapurāṇa (189. 12-13) provides that if a brāhmana dies while the food offered to a preta is still in his stomach he dwells for a kalpa in a horrible hell, becomes a rākṣasa and then becomes free from the sin. 

According to Gaut. 15.10 young persons with the requisite qualifications are to be preferred to older ones, while, according to some, young men were to be invited at a śrāddha for one's deceased father and old men for a śrāddha for one's grand father. On the other hand, Āp. Dh. S. says among brāhmaṇas possessing the same qualifications, the older ones are to be preferred and among those that are old are to be preferred the poor that are anxious to earn money. 8686 

Some of the works lay special emphasis on inviting ascetics or yogins at a śrāddha dinner. The Viṣnu Dh. S. states that yogins 869 are particularly pańktipāvana and quotes a stanza as recited by the pitrs ‘May (a descendant) be born in our family who feeds a brāhmaṇa yogin at a śrāddha by which we are ourselves satisfied.' The Varāhapurāņa 14.50 says that a yogin is superior to 100 brāhmaṇas. The Mārkandeya-purāņa provides a wise man should always feed yogins at a śrāddha since the pitrs rely for support on Yoga; if a yogin is fed by being seated as the first among thousands of brāhmaṇas he saves the performer and the other diners as a boat saves men in water.' Then it quotes stanzas sung by the pitrs (29. 32-34) to king Aila. The Saurapurāņa, after mentioning the qualifica tions (in 19.2-3),870 winds up by stating that even one may suffice provided he be a single-minded devotee of Sivā (verse 6).

The Matsyapurāņa (16. 11-12) recommends 'He who expounds (the meaning of) texts; he who enters upon the discussion of þrauta sacrifices and he who knows the rules about the accents of sāmans is a purifier of panktipāvanas; one proficient in the Sāmaveda, a Vedic student, one endowed with knowledge of the Veda or of Brahma --where these are fed in a śrāddha it yields the highest benefit.' 871 Though in the above passages the greatest emphasis was laid on the possession of Vedic learning by the brahmanas to be fed, one had also to see whether they were men of good character and observers of the rules of proper conduct, as provided by Aśy, Gr. IV. 7. 2 (note 862), Gaut. 15.9 and Manu II, 118 who says 'a brālmana 872 knowing only the sacred Gāyatri but living a well-regulated life is to be preferred and not one who knows the three Vedas but who is not well-regulated in conduct and who eats anything (even forbidden food ) and who is a vendor of everything.' The Skandapurāṇa VI. 217. 27 recommends that one should make every effort to know the family of the brāhmaṇas, then their character (sila), then their age and then the facts about whom they marry or to whom they give their daughters in marriage. The Brahmāņda (Upodghāta, chap. 15) says that there should be no scrutiny of a brāhmana about whom nothing is known because siddhas (yogins) roam about on the earth in the form of brāhmaṇas. But if faults in a brāhmana are easily seen or if one knows his disqualifica tions on account of one's dwelling near him, he should not be invited (verses 5-6). The same Purāna (Upodghāta 15. 24-26) arranges the orders of preference as follows: first yati (ascetic), then a brāhmaṇa who knows the four Vedas and itihāsa, then one who knows three Vedas, then one who knows two, then one who knows one Veda, then one who is an upādhyāya. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 443) quotes the Agni purāņa 873 as follows: 'what is the use of (birth in a) famous

This insistence on worth was due to the conception that pitrs assuming an aerial form enter brāhmaṇas at the time of śrāddha. Vide Brahmāndapurana (Upodghātapāda 11. 49).solaaaaa 

These requirements of learning, character and good conduct would naturally make it incumbent on the performer of a śrāddha to inquire into the antecedents, qualities and defects of the brāhmanas to be invited. Manu and others lay down several rules about the testing of the brāhmaṇas to be invited. Manu III, 149, Visnu Dh.874 S. 82.1-2. provide at an offering to the gods let a man not enquire into (the qualities of a brāhmaṇa ( when he wants to invite ), but at a śrāddha offering to the Manes close inquiry (into qualities ) is declared to be proper and just.' Manu III. 130 says that even if a brāhmana be master of the Veda, one should enquire far (into his ancestry). The Vāyupurāpa 875 appears to provide that inquiry into the qualifications of ) brāhmaṇas should not be always undertaken when gifts are to be made, but enquiry is declared (necessary) in the case of rites for gods and Manes. The Anusā ganaparva provides 876 that in rites meant for gods a ksatriya knowing the rules about gifts should not (closely) inquire into the qualifications of brāhmaṇas, but in rites for the gods and Manes such inquiry is quite proper. Vrddha-Manu and the Matsya-purana877 lay down that a brāhmana's character is to be inquired into at the place where he resides for a long time, his purity by his acts and transactions with other people, his intelli gence by discussion with him: with these three one should inquire whether the brāhmaṇa (to be invited) is a worthy person,

Inquiring into qualifications 

391 

The Nrsimhapurāṇa 878 forbids close inquiry into the character and learning of one who comes by chance as a guest at the time of śrāddha. That inquiry was allowed as to brāhmaṇas who were invited and not as to those who came by chance uninvited as atithis. There are no doubt certain passages particularly in the Puranas where scrutiny into a brāhmana's qualifications is condemned. For example, the Skandapurāņa quoted by Apa rārka (p. 455) and Kalpataru (on śr. p. 102) states * The Vedic revelation is that śrāddha is to be offered to a brāhmana) after inquiry (into his learning and character), but straightforward action is better than scrutiny. When one offers sraddha straightforwardly without inquiry his pitrs are gratified and also gods'. The Bhavisyapurāpa (q. by Balambhatti ) states 'it is my view also that one should not test (the qualifications of) brāhmaṇas; one should only consider their caste and not their virtues'. Such passages are explained away as referring to a śrāddha at sacred places or as applicable to gifts or to atithis (vide Hemādri on śrāddha p. 513, and Bālambhatti on ācāra p. 494 ) 878a 

Brāhmaņas were declared to be apānkteya 879 (not fit to sit in the row of brāhmana diners or as defiling a row of diners at srāddha) on various grounds, such as bodily and mental defects and diseases, pursuit of certain avocations, moral lapses, being guilty of crimes, being followers of unorthodox systems, being inhabitants of certain countries. A distinction has to be made between brāhmanas who should not be invited and brāhmanas that are apānkteya or panktidūṣaka. For example, one should not ordinarily invite a friend or a sagotra brāhmaṇa even

though learned, but these are not apānkteya. The Ap. 880 Dh. S. states that one suffering from white leprosy, a bald man, the violator of another man's bed, the son of a brāhmana who was a soldier by profession, the son of (brāhmana who had become like) a sūdra from a brāhmana woman--these defile the company if they are invited at a śrāddha repast. Vas. Dh. S. XI. 19 also gives a brief list viz. one should avoid naked (asce ties), those suffering from white leprosy, impotent men, blind men, those who have black teeth, those afflicted with black leprosy and those who have deformed nails.

maņas at a śrāddha repast. Manu III. 170-182 indulge in pointing out how feeding such unworthy brāhmanas results in the loss of the gratification of pitrs and state that the food eaten by such unworthy persons becomes or is to be deemed as equal to foul things. The Kūrmapurāṇa 882 forbids inviting at śrāddhas Bauddha ascetics, Nirgranthas (devotees who have withdrawn from the world and wander about naked or as beggars), those that follow the Pañcarātra and Pasupata doctrines, those that are kāpālikas (devotees of Siva of the left hand order) and other similar heretical people. The Visņupurāņa (III. 18. 70 ff) narrates how a king after a bath in a holy place talked with a heretic and had to pass in consequence through the bodies of a dog, a jackal, wolf, vulture, a crow, a crane and peacock and ultimately became freed from the taint by a bath at the ava bhrtha in an Aśvamedha sacrifice. The same Purāna provides (III. 18. 97) that one should avoid talking with or touching heretics, particularly at the time of a religious rite or when one has consecrated for a solemn sacrifice. The Vāyupurāņa 883 provides that people who are 'nagna' should not be allowed to see a śrāddha and then defines "nagna' people as follows: 'the three Vedas are declared to be a protective covering for all beings and therefore those who foolishly abandon the Vedas are called 'nagna'; those who vainly keep matted hair, those who shave their heads for no purpose, those who are nagna (naked) without any cause, those who engage in certain obser vances and mutter certain words aimlessly are called nag nādi'. Just as certain countries were declared unfit for the performance of śrāddhas (vide note 853 above), so certain brāhmaṇas hailing from certain countries were declared in some

works as not fit to be invited at a śrāddha, 894 For example, the Matsyapurāņa states that brāhmaṇas that are ungrateful, that are atheists, that stay in Mleccha countries or the countries of Trisanku, Karavira, Andhra, Cina, Dravida and Konkana should be carefully avoided at the time of śrāddha. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 505) quotes from the Saurapurāṇa the following: 'Brāhmaṇas hailing from the countries of Anga, Vanga, Kalinga, Saurāṣtra, (Kathiawar), Gurjara, Ābhira, Konkana, Dravida, Daksimāpatha, Avanti and Magadha should be avoided at śrāddhas. It will be noticed that putting the above two passages together, brāhmaṇas from half of modern India would have been ineligi ble for being invited at śrāddhas if these passages were literally followed. This was probably a counsel of perfection prompted by the false pride and prejudices of the authors of those works. The Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara (pp. 39-41 ) contains one of the longest lists of persons unfit to be invited at a śrāddha. 

The following reason is advanced by the Varāhapurāṇa 885 and others for honouring a guest who comes by chance at the time when a śrāddha rite is in progress: "Yogins wander over the earth assuming different forms that prevent recognition, but doing good to people; therefore a wise man should honour a guest who arrives at the time of the performance of a śrāddha". The Bhavisya-purāņa 886 similarly says that an atithi ( guest ) at a śrāddha is one who comes when least thought of and not one who had arrived before the śrāddha rite started. The Mārkandeya ( 26, 30 ) provides that one should not ask such an atithi about his gotra or caraṇa or his Vedic study nor should one consider whether he has a fine appearance. Hemādri (on śrāddha pp. 430-433 ) quotes verses from the Sivadharmottara,

Honouring atithi at śrāddha

Visnudharmottara and Vāyu (71.74–75 ) Purānas that gods, siddhas and yogins wander over the earth in the form of brāhmaṇa alithis in order to favour people and to see how srāddhas are being performed. About the definition of an atithi and the necessity and mode of honouring a guest in 

general, vide H, of Dh. vol. II. pp. 749-756. 

Hemādri (Srāddhakāņda, pp. 380-385) holds an interest ing discussion as to whether a performer of śrāddha belonging to one recension of a Veda must restrict himself to inviting brāhmanas that are students of the same recension of the Veda or whether he can invite any brāhmana that may have studied any of the three Vedas. Some people relying on a maxim (as in the case of a bride so in the case of an offering') invite only brāhmaṇas of their own sākhā possessed of the qualifications above set forth. Hemādri replies that this is a wrong notion, relies on Āp. Dh. S. II. 6. 15.9 'one should feed 887 in all (religious) acts brāhmaṇas that are pure (in their conduct) and that have studied the Veda' and asserts that no smrti, Itihāsa, Purāņa, Gphyasūtra nor Kalpasūtra contains the restriction of inviting only brāhmanas of the performer's own sākhā. He further says that in such texts as 'trināciketas trimadhuh' (quoted in note 862a above) the rule laid down is to invite brāhmaṇas that have studied different sakhās and Vedas. He rejects the idea about any restriction as to selecting a bridegroom of the same sākhā as the bride's father and remarks that if some people are not prepared to give their daughters in marriage to young men belonging to other śākhās, that is due to ignorance about the families and is also due to pride and vanity. He winds up by saying that in Aryavarta countries it is found on all sides that marriage connections are entered into with persons studying different sākhās but living in the same district, (such connections) not being con demned, while persons who study the same sākhā of the Veda but do not know each other do not enter into marital connec tions.888 As a contrast to this commonsense view it should be

noted that the author of the Balambhatti recommends that Mahārāstra brāhmaṇas should not invite brāhmanas of other castes (of brāhmaṇas ) and particularly the Konkanastha brāhmaṇas should be avoided and it goes so far as to say that a pergon belonging to one's own caste not possessed of good qualities and of a blemished character (provided he is not guilty of mahāpātakas or the like) should be preferred to one belonging to another sub-caste even if endowed with good qualities.

ing (of food ) is eaten by a yati that knows the truth about pralcrti (primordial matter) and the gunas (sattva, rajas and tamas) reaps the reward (merit) of feeding a thousand (other brahmanas). Therefore one should feed in offerings to gods and manes an excellent yogin who is intent on true knowledge of God and others only if such a one is not available.' Similar verses about ascetics and yogins occur in Varahapurana 14.50, Skanda (VI.217.7 ff) and Vayupuranas91 chap.71.65-73, chap.76.28 &c. Brhaspati provides 892 a special rule that, if a person cannot afford to feed at a śrāddha more than one brāhmaṇa, then he should feed one who has studied the Sāmaveda, since in him all the three viz. Rks, the Yajus and Samans co-exist, that the father is pleased by Rks (i. e. by the feeding of a brahmana who has studied the Rgveda), the grand-father by Yajus, the great-grand-father by a Sāman and a chandoga (a chanter of the whole of Samaveda) is superior. A verse of Satatapa is 893 quoted to the effect that if a student of the Atharvaveda is fed in a rite for the gods or manes, that yields endless and inex haustible rewards. 

Some of the smộtis were very strict in laying down the qualifications of brāhmaṇas to be invited at a śrāddha. Ausa nasa (chap. 4) asserts: 'that brāhmaṇa 891 is called durbrāh mana and should never be invited at a śrāddha in whose family Veda study and Vedi (i. e, the performance of Srauta sacri fices) have been stopped for three generations'.

author 895 further says that six persons are merely brahma bamdhus (i. e. brahmanas by birth or caste alone) viz. one who is hired by a sūdra or a king as a servant, who has a sūdra woman as his wife, who is a village priest and he who subsists by killing (animals) or by catching them. So early as the Mahābhāsya 896 it was stated that austerities (leading a life of restraint and strict observances), Vedic learning and birth (from brahmana parents) are the causes of (a man being called) a brāhmaṇa and that he who is devoid of the first two is a mere brāhmaṇa by caste (but not a real brāhmana). It is curious to note that Yama stated that, if brāhmaṇas that do not declare (or point out) the auspicious nakṣatra or tithi or day or mu hūrta and other auspicious matters, eat (śrāddha) food it be comes inexhaustible. 

But the requisite qualifications were so exacting that it must have been found almost impossible to secure for a śrāddha brāhmaṇas altogether free from any of the blemishes set out above from Manu. Gautama (15. 15-18) contains long lists 897 of over 50 kinds of brāhmanas that were not to be invited at a śrāddha dinner or at a sacrifice for gods, but Gaut, adds that according to some only those beginning with 'durvāla' (Gaut. in 15.18) were to be shunned at a śrāddha (but could be invited at a sacrifice for the gods). The persons so to be shunned, according to some who flourished before Gautama (i. e. at least before 600 B. C.) are: a bald man, a man who has deformed nails or has black teeth (naturally), one suffering from white

Vas. quotes a verse 898 as follows: If a brāhmaṇa knowing the Vedas is afflicted with physical defects which (ordinarily ) exclude a person from a row of diners, Yama declares that he is irrepro achable and that he does sanctify the row of diners. But it must be said that even in modern times emphasis is laid on 

inviting learned and well-conducted brāhmaṇas for śrāddha. The idea (expressed by Manu III. 189 and the Padmapurāņa) persists that the pitrs enter into and hover round the invited brāhmanas and that the latter are to be looked upon as represen ting the pitrs.899 The Garudapurāṇa states that Yama allows the departed souls and the pitrs to visit the world of men at the time of sraddha from the nether regions. 

The Visnu Dh. S. (79.19-21) prescribes that the performer should avoid wrath, should not shed tears and should not do things in a hurry. The Varāhapurāņa 900 provides that the per former should not employ twigs for brushing the teeth (but should rinse his mouth twelve times with water), should remain chaste and pure. Āp. Dh. S. prescribes 901 that the performer should not eat food from the commencement (from the time he goes out to invite) up to the end of the śrāddha rite. The

Kūrma (uttarārdha 22.8) states that if a person first invites a brāhmana and then foolishly invites another (passing over the first) then he becomes a greater sinner (than the brāhmana who after accepting one invitation promises to dine at another śrāddha) and is born as a worm in human faeces. The Bhavisyapurana. 902 provides that honouring gods, pitrs and men and feeding (brāhmaṇas) should not be done without wearing an upper garment; otherwise the rite will bear no fruit. 

About the number of brāhmaṇas to be invited at a śrāddha there were several options and several views. The Āsv. Gr. S. states 903 that at the Pārvana-śrāddha (performed on a parvan day i. e. on Amavasya), the Abhyudayika sraddha, the Ekod dista or Kāmya, the larger the number of brāhmaṇas the greater is the reward, that in no case should a person invite only one brāhmaņa at a śrāddha meant for all pitrs or he may optionally invite only one brāhmaṇa except at the first śrāddha, that he may invite one, two or three brāhmaṇas for each of the three paternal ancestors. The Sān. Gr. (IV. 1,2) and Kausitaki Gr. III. 14.1-2prescribe that one should 904 invite an uneven number of brāhmanas, at least three, to sit down as (representing the ) fathers. Gaut, requires 905 'He shall feed an uneven number

of brahmanas, at least nine or as many as he is able (to food) and that they should be learned in the Veda and endowed with polished speech, good appearance, mature age and good character'. If five were invited two would be for gods and three for pitrs; if soven, then four for gods and three for pitrs and so on. Vas. XI. 27 ( = Manu III, 125 = Baud. Dh. S. II. 8. 29), Yāj. I. 228, Matsya 17. 13-14, Visnupurāṇa III. 15.14 provide that one must feed two brāhmanas at the rite for the gods and three for the manes or one only for each of the two purposes and even a rich man should not go in for a large company. The Padma purāņa (Srsti 9.98 and 141) says the same thing. So the number of brāhmanas to be invited did not depend so much upon the means of the inviter, but upon the point whether the inviter would be able to honour them all properly and with ease. The idea was that at the same time when śrāddha was to be performed two brāhmanas should be fed for gods and three for the pitrs. When only one brāhmana could be invited or was available, Vas. (XI. 30-31) provides that portions of the several foods cooked should be put in a vessel and should be placed at the place where Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇa would have been seated, then served in a plate and the visve devāh be invoked and should be contemplated as present and then the food should be thrown into the fire or offered to a Vedic student (as alms) and then śrāddha rite should be continued Sankha 906 14.10 provides a similar rule. The result is that if a man can afford to invite only one brāhmana or can secure one only, then that brāhmaṇa is meant for the rite in honour of pitrs and the offering for the gods is to be cast into fire. Baud, Dh, S. II, 8.30, Manu TIL. 126, Vas. XI. 28, Kūrma (uttarārdha 22.28 ) contain the same verse which emphatically states 'A large company destroys these five desiderata, viz. the respectful treatment (of those invited), the securing of a proper place (such as one sloping to the south) and time, purity and (the

choice of) meritorious brāhmaṇas; therefore one should not desire a large company'907. The Kūrmapurāṇa (uttarārdha 92.32) insists that an atithi must be fed at a sraddha or other-. wise the śrāddha is not praiseworthy. Though these ancient works insisted upon the avoidance of large preparations and expenses for śrāddhas in honour of a deceased person, there were other smrtis that favoured lavish distribution of wealth in srāddhas. For exanıple, Brhaspati lays down: 

( An heir ) should lay aside half of the wealth that comes to him (by inheritance ) for the benefit of the deceased owner and should expend it in the monthly, six-monthly and yearly śrāddhas'. The Dāyabhāga XI. 12 approves 908 of this and also guotes Ap. Dh. S. II. 6.13.3 "On the failure of a sapinda the teacher of the Veda takes the wealth of the deceased, on failure of the teacher, the pupil takes it and having inleri ted it he should employ it in the performance of works of charity for the benefit of the deceased' (or he himself may enjoy it). These passages show to what lengths the cult of benefit to the soul of the deceased was carried in India by certain writers. More practical authors such as Haradatta did not relish these extreme views. In several purāṇas such as the Vāvu 908a and Visnu there are express directions that when a śrāddha is performed at Gayā, it should be on a profuse scale and no stinginess 909 (lit. cheating in money matters ) in spending wealth should be shown there; otherwise the performer would not reap the benefit of the performance of śrāddha at that holy place. The Padmapurāņa appears to inculcate profuse

expenditure of wealth in all śrāddhas. The Vāyupurāņa 910 (82. 26-28 ) further says that the brāhmanas of Gayā are super men, that when they are gratified (at a śrāddha) the gods together with pitrs become gratified, that no question should be raised about the family, the character, the learning and the austerities (of the Gayā brāhmaṇas), that by honouring them a man attains liberation, that a man after honouring the brāhmaṇas should proceed according to his resources and strength to the performance of śrāddha; thereby he secures all heavenly desires and obtains the means of Moksa. The Skanda purāṇa goes so far as to say that Gayā brāhmaṇas even if they are depraved in their conduct and are backward deserve to be invited at śrāddha and are superior to brāhmanas who have mastered the Veda and Vedāngas. The Nirnayasindhu (III. p. 401 ) notes that, according to the Tristhalisetu of his grandfather, this provision holds good only in the case of the śrāddha at the Aksayya Vata in Gaya and nowhere else. In modern times the brāhmanas at Gayā used to require the performer of śrāddha while he was in the sacred Phalgu river to make a declaration about his wealth and demanded fees accordingly, thereby carrying to the letter the words of the Vāyupurāṇa. Many people returned from Gayā thoroughly dis illusioned and disgusted with the conduct of the brāhmanas at Gayā. In the Varāhapurāṇa 911 it is said that two verses were sung by the pitrs viz.Would such a blessed and intelli. gent man be born in our family who will offer pindas (i. e. śrāddha) to us without being stingy about wealth and who would bestow on brāhmaṇas with reference to us (i. e. for our bənefit) jewels, clothes, land, costly vehicles and all other kinds of wealth including water, when he has riches enough? Here lavish expenditure on all śrāddhas (not only at Gayā. śrāddha) appears to be strongly recommended. Devala prc

vides that on the days of srauta sacrifices, of the celebration of charitable acts, of śrāddhas on the anniversary of death or on amāvāsyā, on lucky occasions (urddhi), on Astakā days, one should never give a frugal or poor dinner to 911a the worthy brāhmaņas invited for dinner. 

If no brāhmaṇa is available, then the Srāddhaviveka, Śrāddhatattva and other digests say that effigies of brāhmaṇas made with seven or nine darbhas (except in the case of a per former following the Sāmaveda who is not restricted as to the number of darbhas) should be got ready and śrāddha should be performed and afterwards the fee and other materials may be given later on to other brahmanas 912. 

Rules were laid from very ancient times about the method of inviting brahma.nas. The A.p. Dh. S. states 912 that the performer should make a request to the brāhmaṇas on the previous day, that on the day of the śrāddha he should request a second time (saying 'today is the śrāddha day') and then he should address them a third time (with the words food is ready, come').

itself. The Matsyapurāņa 913 and Padma (Sșsti-khanda 9.85-88) provide that the person intending to perform a śrāddha should in an humble manner invite the brāhmanas on the previous day or (in the morning of the day of śrāddha, that he should touch the right knee (of the brāhmana to be invited) with the words 'you are given this invitation by me' and repeat in their hearing the following observance you should be free from anger, should be intent on purity of body and mind) and should abstain from sexual intercourse and I, the performer of śrāddha, shall also act in the same way and that the pitrs in an aerial form wait upon the invited brāhmanas,' The Brhan-nāradīya-purāṇa states that the invitation should be in the words 'O best men! You should do me a favour and accept the invitation for śrāddha.' It is noteworthy that the Prajāpati-smrti (63) prescribes that one should invite brāhmaṇas for a śrāddha or sacrifice for gods in the evening of the previous day after uttering the verse 'akrodhanaiḥ &c.'914 The Skandapurāņa VI. 217. 37 says that the performer should address the brāhmana as follows: 'my father (is or will enter) into this your body and so will my grand-father; let him (the grand-father) come with his father and you should strictly observe the vrata' (the rules). The invitation to the brāhmanas representing pitės is to be given with the sacred thread in the prācīnāvīta form and to those for Vaišvadevika in the yajñopavīta form. On the question whether the Vaišvadevika brāhmanas were to be invited first or the brāhmaṇas for pitrs were to be invited first

there is a conflict among smrtis and the medieval digests propose an option (vide Hemādri on śrāddha pp. 1154-1157). Manu III. 205 appears to lay down that the daiva brāhmana should be invited first (daivādyantam tad-iheta). Yama quoted by several digests 915 says that the performer should request in the evening of the previous day brāhmaṇas with the words You should all be free from exertions and should avoid passion and anger for the śrāddha in my house which is to be performed tomorrow,' that the brāhmaṇas should reply 'let it be so if the night passes happily and without any mishap to us! digests (e. g. Śrāddhakriyākaumudi p. 81, Śrāddhatattva p. 194 and Nirnayasindhu III, p. 804) say that the verse 'saryāyāsa &c,' may be repeated when the invitation is given on the day previous to the day of śrāddha and the verse 'akrodhanaih' when the invitation is given on the morning of the śrāddha day. The words of invitation differ according to different authorities, For example, according to the Mit. on Yāj. I. 225 the words are śrāddhe ksanah kriyatām.'. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 also, Manu III. 187 and 191 show that the words 'nimantrana' and 'amantrana' are used as synonyms. In the Srāddhasūtra 916 of Kātyāyana the word 'āmantrana' is used. But Pānini 917 (III. 3. 161) apparently makes a difference between the meanings of the two words and the Mahābhāsya explains that invitation is called 'nimantrana' which if rejected (without proper cause) involves a fault or sin, while that invitation which one is free to reject (without incurring blame) is called 'āmantrana.' There fore, it must be held that the few writers such as Kātyāyana who employ amantrana use it in a secondary sense. The invitation should be given by a performer himself or by his son,

brother or a pupil or a brāhmaṇa, but it should not be given through a person of another varna 918 or a woman or a child or person belonging to another gotra nor from a distance (Prajāpati 64). Pracetas provides that a brāhmana performer of grāddha when giving an invitation should touch the right knee, a ksatriya inviter the left knee of the invitee, a Vaisya inviter should hold both feet of the invitee and a sūdra should prostrate himself at the feet of the invitee (vide Sr. Pr. p. 106 and S. K. L. p. 47 ). The Markandeya (28. 35) states an exception that if, when a śrāddha rite is going on, brāhmaṇas or Vedic students or ascetics come by chance begging for food, the performer should make them pleased by falling at their feet and feed them (i.e. no formal invitation is necessary in these cases). Vide Visnupurāṇa III. 15. 12 for feeding uninvited ascetics. It is provided by Bhrgu quoted by Hemādri that the brāhmaṇas on accepting the invitation should pronounce the finely-worded and comprehensive Vedic benediction quoted below.919 

Ušanas 919a provides that the performer should wash the floor of his house with water, cowdung it and cleanse the vessels on the day previous to the śrāddha and then give an invitation to the brāhmanas with the words tomorrow I am going to perform śrāddha'. The Varāhapurama and the Kurma also provide for this and for the washing of the clothes. Manu III. 206 also requires that the spot where śrāddha is to be performed should be clean, secluded, cowdunged and should slope to the south. 

The Srāddhasūtra of Katyāyana 920 prescribes that a brāh

mana who has been invited (to a śrāddha dinner) by a faultless performer should not refuse the invitation nor should he, after being invited (and having accepted the invitation), accept a gift of even (uncooked) food from another person. Manu III. 190 and Kūrmapurāṇa provide that if a brāhmana after receiving an invitation for a sacrifice to gods or manes according to śāstra directions and after having accepted it violates the appoint ment, he incurs sin and becomes a hog 921 (in his next birth). This does not apply where he is unable to go on account of illness or other valid reason, 

The smrtis laid down some strict and elaborate rules which were to be observed by the brāhmaṇas invited for śrāddha and by the performer himself. Many of the rules are applicable to both. Gaut. prescribes 922 that the brāhmana who has partaken of śrāddha dinner should remain chaste (i. e. shun sexual inter course) that whole day, and if he has intercourse with a wife of the sūdra caste he thereby makes his own pitrs stay in the ordure of that wife. Vas. XI, 37 makes this rule applicable both to the performer and the invited brāhmaṇa and as regards wives of all varņas. Manu III. 188 provides that the brāhmana invited to dine at a sacrifice in honour of pitrs and the per former of the śrāddha should remain controlled (i. e. chaste and free from anger and passion) and should not study the Veda (except japa). Yāj. I. 225 (latter half) briefly puts the matter by saying 'they should be controlled as to their bodies, speech and thoughts'. The Matsyapurana 923 prescribes that both the performer of śrāddha and the brāhmana invited to dine at it should avoid dining again (after the śrāddha dinner), journey, going in a conveyance, exertions, sexual intercourse, study of the Veda, quarrel and sleeping by day. Similar rules to observe continence are laid down for both on the day of śrāddha if invitation be given on the morning of the day of

śrāddha and also on the previous day if invitation be given on the day previous to the grāddha day. Vide Visnu Dh. S. 69. 2-4, The Mit, on Yāj. I. 79 appears to strike a dissenting note about sexual intercourse with one's wife during the days from the 5th to the 16th; while most other medieval writers such as Hemādri (śr. pp. 1006-7) and Śr. P. p. 111 are opposed to this view. The Srāddhasūtra 924 of Kātyāyana provides that the performer should, from the time of giving invitation to the time when the brāhmaṇas sip water (i. e. performācamana after śrāddha dinner), remain pure, free from anger, hurry, negligence, should speak the truth and should shun a journey, sexual intercourse, hard work and study of the Veda and control speech (should remain mostly silent) and the brāhmanas invited should observe the same rules. Aušanasa (Jiv. vol. I. pp. 526-527) contains verses very similar in import to Kātyāyana. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 106-108), Mārkandeya (28. 31-33) and Anušāsana 125.24 have identical verses 925 and Vāyu 79.60-61 are very similar in import. Laghu-Sankha 29, Laghu-Hārīta 75 and Likhita 60 have the same verse requiring the invited brahmanas to avoid eight matters, viz. dining again, journey, carrying loads, Vedic study, sexual intercourse, making gifts, accepting gifts, performing homa, while Prajāpati 92 substi tutes the brushing of the teeth (with a twig), tāmbula, bath after applying oil to the body, and fast for the first four of the above eight. The Anušāsanaparva (90. 12-13) and Padma (Pātālakhanda 101. 94-95) also contain a list of actions that should be avoided. Briefly put, the following were the obser vances for both inviter and invitee, viz. avoidance of sexual intercourse, dining again, falsehood, hurry, vedic study, heavy work, gambling, carrying burdens, giving gifts and acceptance of gifts, theft, journey, sleep by day, quarrels; the performer alone was to abstain from eating tambūla, shaving, applying oil to the body, brushing the teeth with a twig; while the brāh.

mana invited was (alone) to observe the following, viz. not absenting oneself after accepting an invitation, making no delay when called for dinner (vide Srāddhakalikā folio 4b and 5a and Pitr-bhakti on śrāddha 926 ). 

Elaborate provisions are made from ancient times about the substances and utensils proper for being used at srāddha and about those that should not be used therein. Ap. Dh. 927 S. remarks: the materials in śrāddha are sesamum, māsas, rice, yavas (barley ), water, roots and fruits; but the pitrs are extremely gratified by food that is mixed with clarified butter and for a very long time; so also they are gratified by wealth that is obtained lawfully and is bestowed on worthy persons'. Manu III. 267 ( Vāyu 83.3) is to the same effect as Ap. Dh. S. Yāj. I. 258 is content to say that food which is fit to be offered in sacrifices (havisya) should be served. Manu III, 257 explains that food eaten by hermits in the forest, (cow's) milk, soma juice, meat that is not prepared with spices (or that is free from a bad smell), rock salt are by their very nature havis (sacrificial food). According to Gaut. 27. 11 the sacrificial food (havis) comprises boiled rice, food obtained by begging, ground barley (after being baked or fried), grain separated from husk, barley gruel, vege tables, milk, curds, clarified butter, roots, fruits and water. 928 Other smrtis and digests very much elaborated these brief indications in the early works. The three kinds of wealth (viz. śukla, sabala and krsna ) and the several lawful or uncondemned means of acquiring wealth have been described already in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 130 ff. The Mārkandeya (29. 14-15) condemns the use in śrāddhas of wealth that is obtained by taking bribes or from a patita (one guilty of a grave sin), that springs from bride-price or that is declared to be unlawful or is obtained by saying to another 'give me for the sake of a śrāddha to be offered to my father' (q. by Sm.C. on

srāddha p. 412). The Skandapurāṇa emphasizes that at a śrāddha purity (suddhi) must be specially secured in seven matters viz. the body of the performer), the materials, the wife, the place (where śrāddha is to be performed), the mind, the mantras and brāhmanas.929 Manu III. 235 (= Vas, 11.35) states: three are the sanctifying things in a śrāddha, viz. a daughter's son, a Nepal blanket and sesamum grains and three are commended in śrāddha viz, cleanliness, freedom from anger and absence of hurry.929a Pracetas mentions several kinds of oorn that are commended as food in grāddha. Manu III, 255 summarises that in śrāddha the riches (i. e. the most im portant matters) are afternoon, darbhas, proper cleansing of the place (or house) for śrāddha, sesame, generous expense (on food &c.), seasoning food, eminent brāhmanas, 

The Mārkandeya-purāņa says that several kinds of corn yielding plants (some due to tillage in villages and some growing wild) were produced by Brahmā when he milked the earth for famished people, while Brahmavaivarta (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 537) affirms that when a few particles fell down on the earth while Indra drank. Soma, from them arose such corn as śyāmāka, wheat, yava, mudga and red paddy and as they were produced from soma they were like nectar to the pitřs and food prepared from these should be offered to pitrs. The Mārkandeya speaks of seven kinds of grāmya corn and seven kinds of wild (āranya) corn. Prajāpati 119 recommends the use of eight kinds of corn, viz. nivāra, māṣa, mudga, wheat, paddy, yava, grain and sesamum, The Matsya (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 538) narrates that when the Sun drank nectar some drops fell down from which arose the several kinds of

paddy, midga, sugarcane and that therefore sugar is sacred and may be employed in sacrifices to gods and manes. The Mārkandeya 930 mentions several kinds of corn that may be employed for śrāddha food. The Brahma-purāṇa 220. 154 155, Vayu 82. 3, Visnupurana III. 16. 5-6, Vispu, Dh. S., 931 Brahmānda II, 7. 143-152 and III. 14. contain similar lists of different kinds of corn that may be used in śrāddhas. The Vāyupurāņa (80. 42-48) mentions various desirable eatables prepared from corn of various kinds, sugar and clarified butter and milk..932 

Certain kinds of corn and cereals were forbidden. For example, the Matsya-purana and Padma (Srstikhanda, chap. 9. 62-66 )933 declare that masüra, linseed, nispāva, rājamāsa, kusumbhika, kodrava, udāra, gram, kapittha, madhūka and linseed are forbidden. Visnu Dh. S. 79.18 provides that the performer should avoid the bean called rājamāsa, masüra, stale food and salt manufactured from seawater. The Sat-trimsa nmata 934 forbids the use in śrāddha of all kinds of cereals covered with dark. husk except sesamum, mudga and māṣa.

What milk and water to be used 

415 

From considerations of space this matter cannot be pursued further. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 240 puts together a long list of allowed and of condemned kinds of grains and other articles. 

What milk should be ordinarily partaken of and what should be avoided has been dealt with in H. of Dh, vol. II, pp. 782-783. A few words are added here. Manu III, 271 and Yāj. I. 258 provide that if cow's milk or rice cooked therein (called pāyasa) is offered in srāddha the pitrs are satisfied for one year. Vāyu 78. 17, Brahma 935 220.169, Mārkandeya 32,17-19, Viṣnupurāṇa III.16.11 forbid the use in a śrāddha of the milk of a she-buffalo, of a camari or female deer, of sheep or ewes, of she camels, of human females and of all animals with one hoof and the use of the curds and clarified butter prepared from such milk. But ghee prepared from buftalo milk was allowed by Sumantu and Devala (q. by Hemādri on śrāddha p. 572). 

The Mārkandeyapurāṇa 936 (29.15-17), Vāyu (78.16) and Viṣnupurāpa (III, 16.10) lay down that the water to be employed in sraddha must not have a bad smell, must not be foamy, or taken from a puddle or a small reservoir which cannot slake the thirst of a cow, must not have been brought overnight, must not be taken from a reservoir not dedicated to all or from a trough or the like meant for beasts. 

Several rules are laid down about the fruits, roots and vegetables recommended or condemned for use in srāddha. For example, the Brahma-purāņa (220.156-158 ) enumerates several kinds of fruits such as mangoes, bilva, pomegranate, cocoanut, dates, grapes, as fit to be given in śrāddha. Vide Sankha 14.22-23 also. Vāyu (78.11-15 ) states936c that garlic, leeks and onions, other things that are of bad odour or taste

and all exudation from trees not permitted by the Veda and salt gathered from saltish earth, should be avoided in śrāddha. The Viṣnudharmasūtra 937 (79.17) contains a long list of fruits, bulbs and vegetables that were not to be employed in sraddha. The Rāmāyāna states 938 that Rāma when an exile in the Dandaka forest gratified his pitys by offering the fruits of inguda, badara, and bilva trees and generalises that deities are offered that food which is partaken of by a person (who is a devotee of That deity). From considerations of space detailed references to the smộtis and purāņas are passed over. The Smộtyarthasāra pp. 52-53, Srāddhaviveka (pp. 43-47 ) of Rudradhara and other digests collect in one place the foods, vegetables, fruits and roots that are allowed to be offered in śrāddha and that are condemned in sraddha. Manufactured salt was forbidden, but natural salt from a lake (called saindhava) was allowed. Salt was not to be served directly (as Visnudharmasūtra 79.12 says) but when put in while cooking vegetables it was not prohibited. There was a difference of opinion about the employment of asafoetida (vide Hemādri on Srāddha p. 565). The Visnudharmasutra (79.5-6) provides that flowers having a strong (or nasty) odour or no odour at all, the blossoms of thorny plants and red flowers should not be given, but one may give white and sweet-smell ing flowers even though they are taken from thorny plants and flowers though red in colour may be taken from aquatic plants. Sankha (14. 15-16) is to the same effect (q. by Hemādri p. 684). Vāyu (75. 33-35) is to the same effect and adds that the flowers called Japā, Bhandi, Rūpikā (of arka plant), Kurantaka should be avoided in sraddha. The Brahmapurana (220.162 165 ) specifies the several kinds of flowers that may be offered in śrāddha such as jāti, campaka, mallikā, mango blossom, tulasi, tagara, ketaki and various kinds of lotuses ( white, blue and red &c.). The Smộtyarthasāra includes tulasi among things to be avoided in śrāddha. The Sm. O. notes this and remarks

that it is not clear on what this dictum prohibiting tulasi is 

based 938a. 

Kušas are required in srāddha. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II. p.657 for general remarks on kusas. A few words may be added here. The Sat. Br. VII, 2.3.2 states that the waters that loathed Vrtra went out to waterless deserts and became bushes of darbhas 939. Similarly, Ašv. Gr. III. 2.2 summarizes a Brāh mana text stating that darbhas are the essence of waters and herbs (apam va esa osadhinām raso yad-darbhah). Prajapati (verse 98 ) 9394 provides that darbhas should be gathered from a pure spot in the morning by a brāhmaṇa, should have mantras repeated over them, should be greenish in colour, should be as long as a cow's ear and then they are holy. The Gobhila gr. (1. 5. 16-17) states the barhis consists of kuģa grass cut off at the points at which the blades diverge from the main stalk and that the blades should be cut off near the roots at the rites meant for the Fathers'. Daksa (II, 33 and 35) provides that the second part of the day (divided into eight parts) is the proper time for collecting fuelsticks, flowers and kusas. The Gobhilasmrti (I. 20-21) says 940 that the darbhas used in sacrifices are gree nish, those to be used in Pākayajñas should be yellowish, those in rites for the pitrs must be taken out from the roots and those that are to be used in Vaišvadeva should be dark-pale, and that

greenish darbhas together with ends uncut, that are smooth and well nourished, one aratni in length and touched with that part of the hand called pitrtirtha are pure, The Padmapurāņa (Srstikhanda 11.92 ) and Skanda VII1. 205.16 state that kuģas and black sesamum spring from the body of Visnu and the Vispudharmottara I. 139.12 says that tilas and darbhas sprang from the perspiration and hair of Visnu in the Boar incarna tion. The Matsya ( 22.89 ) says the same. 

The Garuda 941 (Pretakhanda 2.21-22) states that all the three gods dwell in kusa grass viz. Brahmā at its root, Visnu in the middle and Sankara at the end and that brāhmaṇas, mantras, kuśas, fire, tulası leaf--these do not become nirmālya (stale and so unfit to be used again ) even when the same are employed again and again. But an exception is made by Gobhila 942 that those darbhas which are spread on the ground for placing pindas on them or that are used in tarpana and those that are held in the hand while a man is answering the calls of nature should be given up (and not used again). The Visņu Dh, S. 79.2 and Vāyu 75.41 provide that if kušas are not avail able, kāśa grass or Dūrvā may be substituted. The Skanda purāṇa VII (Prabhāsakhanda ) part 1.206.17 says that straight darbhas are used in giving gifts, at baths, in japa, homa, dinner and worship of gods, but they are double-folded when used in rites for pitrs. The Skanda VII. 1. 205,16 provides that the top of darbhas is for divine rites, while darbha with the root and tip is meant for paityka rites. This is based on the Sat. Br. II. 4. 2.17 which states that the top of the darbha belongs to gods, the middle to men and the root part to the fathers, 

Great importance was attached to the use of tila (sesamum) in śrāddha. The Jaiminigshya II.1 states that the whole house should have sesamum grains scattered about in it. Baud. Dh. S. II. 8,8 provides that when the invited brahmanas come they should be given water mixed with sesame. The Baud. gr. II. 11.64 provides that sesamum grains are holy in sraddha for making gifts of them or as part of food or for being mixed in

water. The Prajapatismrti speaks 943 of four kinds of tilas viz. white, black, very black and jartilas and states that each succeeding one gives greater gratification to the pitrs than each preceding one. The Tai.s.V. 4.3.2 refers tojartilas and Jai. X.8.7 holds a discussion thereon. The Naradapurana (purvardha 28.36) 944 provides that the performer of śrāddha should scatter tilas in the midst of the brāhmaṇas invited and at the doors with the mantra 'apahatā' (may the asuras and evil spirits that sit on the altar be struck and run away). Yaj. I. 234 also recommends this mantra ( which is Vāj. S. II. 29). The Kūrma purana (II. 22.18) states that sesame should be scattered all round and a goat should be tied near the spot, since srāddha polluted by asuras becomes purified by sesame and a goat. The Visnupurāṇa (III. 16.14) prescribes that by tilas scattered on the ground one should ward off evil spirits (Yātudhāna ). The Garudapurana 945 ( Pretakhanda 2. 16 ) makes Srikrsna say "tilas have sprung from the perspiration on my body and are holy; asuras, dānavas and daityas run away on account of tilas.' The Anusāsana-parva (90.22 ) says that yātudhānas and goblins snatch away the havis when the srāddha is offered without tilas. The Krtyaratnākara (p. 540 ) quotes a verse as follows: 'he who applies as unguent tilas, who bathes with water in which tilas are mixed, offers tilas into fire, makes gifts of tilas, eats tilas and who grows tilas-these six never sink (i. e. are not unlucky nor in trouble ). 

A great deal is said about the vessels to be used in offering arghya (water for honouring the invited brāhmaṇas and pipdas), for cooking śrāddha food, for dining and for serving. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana 946 provides that the arghya water

The तै. सं.V.4.3.2 has this passage 'जतिलयवाग्वा वा जुहयाद्वीधुकयवाग्वा न ग्राम्यान् पशून् हिनस्ति नारण्यानथो खल्वाहुर नाहुति जतिलाश्च गवीधुकाश्चेत्यजक्षीरेण जुहोति. शबर appears to quote काठकसंहिता 

The conclusion arrived at by Jai. X. 8.7 is that the passage about जतिलs is an अर्थवाद for praising पयोहोम. The स्मृतिच. (श्राद्ध) p. 433 says जतिलास्तु तिलाः प्रोक्ताः कृष्णवर्णा वने भवा इति सत्यवतेनाभिधानात्.

should be taken in camasas (cups ) made of sacrificial trees (such as palāśa, aśvattha, udumbara ) or in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn, precious stones whichever may be available, or in a vessel made of leaves. The Vispu Dh. S. (179. 14-15) provides that the performer should employ metallic vessels, particularly vessels made of silver. The Mārkandeya (31.65) and Vāyu (74.3) state that in a vessel of silver the (ancient) pitrs milked svadhā and hence a silver vessel is highly desired by pitrs and brings de light to them. Yăj. I. 237 also specially recommends silver vessels. The Vayu (74. 1-2), Matsya (17. 19-22), Brahmānda (Upodghāta 11. 1-2) and Padma (Srstikhanda 9. 147-150) state that vessels of gold, silver or copper are the (proper) ones for pitrs; that even the talk about silver or the sight or gift of silver gives inexhaustible results to pitrs in heaven, that vessels to be used for arghya, for pipda and for the food to be offered should be preferably of silver and that in rites for gods a silver vessel is not auspicious. Atri (q. by Sm. C. II, p. 464) says that in rites for the gods and pitrs, vessels of gold and silver should be respectively employed and in default of these vessels of other metals (such as copper, bell-metal) should be used (as stated by Visnu Dh. S. 79.22 and 24). The Padma provides 947 that the vessels may be of sacrificial wood or of palāśa or of silver or made from a sea product (such as conch shell) and that since silver was produced from the eye of Siva, it is a great favourite with pitrs. Prajāpati (111) provides that the three piņdas should be cast in a vessel of gold or silver or copper or bell metal or of rhinoceros horn but not in earthenware or a wooden vessel, that (verse 112) the cooking vessels should be of copper or of any metal, but an earthen vessel baked in fire and immersed in water is the best (for cooking), that food cooked in an iron vessel is like crow's flesh, that (115) the vessels to be used for taking food by the brāhmaṇas should be made of gold, silver or of an alloy of five metals or they may take their food in patrāvali (i. o. leaves stitched together); vide also Matsya

Vessels to be used at śrāddha

17. 19-20. The use of plantain leaves for bhojana is forbidden"47a by some. Brāhmanas should not take ācamana from a vessel made of bell-metal, kharpara, śukra, stone, clay, wood, fruit or iron. Acamana should be performed with water from a copper vessel. Atri (153) prescribes that no food should be served from an iron vessel, if so served the food is like ordure to the diner and the server goes to hell. The vessels for cook ing śrāddha food are to be made of gold, silver, copper or bell metal or even of clay provided the last are new ones and strong 

(well baked) but never of iron. Vide Sr. Pr. p. 155 for details. The Viṣnu Dh. S. (79. 24) quotes a verse which says that food offered in vessels of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or of phalgu wood becomes inexhaustible. 

Visnu Dh, S. 79. 11 provides that for unguents (anulepana) to be applied to the bodies of the invited brāhmaṇas, sandal wood, saffron, camphor, aguru, padmaka may be used. The Brahmapurāņa (220. 165-166) mentions kustha, jatā-mānsi, nutmeg, uśīra, mustā and some others as proper perfumed articles to be used at śrāddhas. 

It has already been seen at pp. 413-14 what kinds of food were recommended or condemned for śrāddha. The Matsyapurāņa 948 states that food containing milk and curds and clarified butter from cow's milk mixed with sugar gives satisfaction to all pitrs for one month and that whatever food, whether cow's milk or ghee or rice cooked in milk, is mixed with honey, yields inexhaustible results. The Brahmapurāpa also ( 220. 182-184) provides that such eatables as are sweet and oily and are slightly sour and pungent should be served in śrāddha and one should shun eatables that are very sour or very saltish or very pungent, since they are ūsura (fit for asuras). Great emphasis was laid on serving preparations of food made from māṣa

beans. The Aušanasa 949smrti pronounces the threat that the brāhmana, who, when dining at śrāddha, does not eat māsa food, becomes a beast for twenty-one births after death. The Sm. C. quotes a smrti text saying that a śrāddha in which no māsa preparation is offered is as good as not performed. 

The greatest divergence has prevailed about the employ ment of flesh at śrāddhas among writers from the earliest times. The subject of flesh-eating in general has been discussed at great length in the History of Dharmaśāstra, vol. II, pp. 772-782. A few remarks about flesh in relation to śrāddha will not be out of place here. The Ap. Dh. S. prescribes 950 that the obli gatory śrāddha (to be performed every month) must contain food mixed with fat, the best course (for supplying fat) is to employ clarified butter and flesh; on failure of these two, sesa mum oil and vegetables may be employed. The same sūtra also provides 951 that the pitrs are gratified for a year by the offering of cow's flesh in a śrāddha, that by the flesh of a buffalo the gratification of pitrs extends to more than a year, that this rule extends to the flesh of wild animals (like hares) and village (or domesticated) animals (like goats) that are declared to be fit for being sacrificed, that the gratification of pitrs extends to endless time if the flesh of a rhinoceros is offered to brāhmaṇas seated on rhinoceros skin, so also by the flesh of the

Several forms are met with in printed works viz. वाणस or वार्धाणस or वाध्रीणस.

fish called 'satabali' and the flesh of a Vārddhrīnasa. Vas. XI. 34 contains the following remarkable Verse: 'an ascetic, when invited in a rite for the gods or pitrs, who avoids (does not partake of) flesh, dwells in Hell for as many years as the number of hair (on the body of the animal whose flesh he avoids).' Even the Visnudharmottarapurāṇa (T. 140. 49–50) emphatically asserts that he who does not partake of flesh-food in a row of diners at a grāddha which has been properly em ployed goes to hell Manu V. 35 and Kūrma II. 17.40 contain a similar verse applicable to all those who are invited as brāh maņas at a śrāddha. The Kūrmapurāņa II. 22.75 provides that the brahmana who is employed for the performance of a śrāddha and does not eat flesh offered therein becomes a beast for 21 births. Manu III. 257 states that the following are said to be proper offerings in a śrāddha by their very nature viz. food (prepared from nīvāra grain and the like) fit for a forest hermit, milk, soma juice, flesh that does not emit foul smell and unmanufactured salt. An ascetic was ordinarly required not to partake of flesh; but Vasistha insisted on his partaking of it when invited at a śrāddha.

honey, of food fit for hermits (wild corn such as nīvāra), the flesh of a red goat, of Mahāśāka (i. e. Kālašāka), and the flesh of Vārdhrīnasa--these secure inexhaustible fruit. There is some divergence of views among the several works. For example, Manu III. 267 and 271, Katyāyana (in srāddhasūtra 7 ) appear to hold that by offering food prepared from village corn (such as rice, māsa & c.) or wild eatables (such as nīvāra or fruits and roots) the gratification is only for one month and the flesh of Vārdhrinasa produces gratification for twelve years only (and not for all time ). Visnu Dh, S. 80.10 and Manu III. 270 bring in buffalo flesh and tortoise flesh as giving gratification for ten and eleven month respec tively. Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 590 ) 953 is careful to point out that these words about the duration of time are not to be taken literally but what is really intended is to convey greater and greater gratification of the pitrs according to the kind of flesh offered. Pulastya quoted by the Mit. and Aparārka p. 555 provides that a brāhmaṇa should generally or mainly offer at a śrāddha hermit's food, a ksatriya or a vaisya should offer flesh, a śūdra should offer honey and all varnas may offer anything else (except these three) which is not forbidden. 954 Whoever may be the offerer, the eater at a śrāddha dinner was to be a brāhmaṇa alone and so it follows that brāhmaṇas invited to a śrāddha by a kṣatriya or vaisya had to eat flesh. Yet it is remarkable that even the Mitākṣarā and the Kalpataru written about 1100-1120 A. D. do not expressly say that in the Kali age flesh-eating at śrāddha is totally prohibited at least for brāhmaṇas. It has been shown already (H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 775-776) that even when animal sacrifices were the order of the day in the Rgveda and the Brāhmaṇas there was an undercurrent of thought that the offerings of fuel-sticks or of boiled rice when made with heart felt devotion to the gods were as good as flesh offerings for

securing their favour. In course of time that conception grew 361 onger and stronger, so much so that Manu (V. 27-44 and V.46-47) and Vasistha appear to be in two minds (vide H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 778–780). Gradually the offering of flesh in Madhuparka and in śrāddhas came to be totally condemned in works of the 12th and 13th centuries and onwards as a matter prohibited in the Kali age (Varātithipitrbhyasca pašūpākaranakriya). (Vide H. of Dh, vol. III pp. 945-946 and p. 964). Now except among the brāhmanas (in Northern India ) who have no objection to include fish in diet as permissible to them no brāhmana offers flesh in śrāddha, The usage of Northern India would be in accordance with the view set out in Brhannāradiya-purāṇa that one should offer honey, flesh and other things according to the usage of the country, as explained by the Přthvicandrodaya. 

Manu ( V.11-18) contains long lists of animals, birds and fishes whose flesh was not to be eaten even by those who were flesh-eaters. 

If a person is destitute, some of the Purāṇas such as the Visnu (III. 4.24-30) and the Varāha (13,53-58) mercifully provide in identical 955 verses that instead of entertaining brāhmanas with a sumptuous dinner or flesh the poor man may offer only un cooked corn, or some vegetables growing wildly or some slight daksinā if he cannot offer even uncooked food or vegetables, or he may offer a few grains of sesamum (7 or 8 ) to a brāhmana with water in his folded hands, or grass to a cow enough for one day and if he cannot afford even any one of these, then he may repair to a thicket of trees, raise his arms so that his armpits are exposed and loudly address the guardians of the worlds such as the Sun in the following words: 'I have neither wealth nor money nor anything else fit to be offered by way of śrāddha; I bow to my pitrs; may the pitřs be satisfied by my devotion; I have stretched these arms in space!' (lit, the path of the wind).

It is now time to describe the procedure of the Pārvaņa Sraddha. 955a which is the pattern or norm (prakrti) of the other śrāddhas 956 (even including the Aṣtakās). Here one meets with great divergences of views even from the times of the sūtras up to modern times. Though the main items and stages in the rite of śrāddha are generally the same, there is variation in the mantras, the details and sometimes in the order of the several items. Kātyāyana lays down that every man has to follow his own sūtra as to the use of the word 'svāhā' or the words 'svadhā namah', as to wearing the sacred thread in the yajñopavita or prācīnāvita way and as to the number of āhutis 957 

It would be very interesting first to find out the vestiges of the sacrifice to the fathers in the most ancient Vedic texts. The Tai, S. (I. 8. 5. 1-2) deals 958 with the Mahāpitryajña per 

955 a. Terms already explained such as Pārvana' and 'Ekoddista! are not explained again, Vide n. 855above for those two words. Sraddha on amavasya, is obligatory (nitya) as laid down by Gaut. 15.1q. in note 935 above, while the srāddhas performed on the other tithis of the dark half of a month are kāmya.

He says 'to Soma drunk by the pitrs, svadhāl Adoration!' He says to Agni, the carrier of kavya, svadhā! Adoration ! (Thereby ) he pleases the fire that pertains to the pitrs. He offers (into fire ) three oblations; he puts down (on the darbhas spread on the ground) three pindas. (These) thus come to six in number. Six indeed are the seasons. He (thereby) pleases the seasons. The seasons are indeed the shining (or divine) pitrs......The darbha grass is cut with one stroke; the pitrs have as it were (passed away) once for ever. He puts down thrice (the pindas). The pitrs are indeed in the third world from here. He (thereby) pleases them. He (the performer) turns his face away to the north from the south), for the Fathers are shy. He remains with his face turned away till the steam (of the boiled rice of the pindas) ceases to rise, for the Fathers have the steam of rice as their share; he should simply gmell (the pindas). That as if does not amount to eating or non-eating. The pitřs when departing (from the śrāddha rite) take away or grant a valiant son. He cuts off the fringe (of a garment to place it on the pindas), for the share of Fathers is taking away (what is offered). He (thereby) allots their proper share to the pitrs (and dismisses them). When the performer) is in the latter part of life (i. e, over 50 years of age) he cuts off hair (from his chest instead of presenting a daśa). At that time he is nearer to the pitrs (when above 50 years of age). He offers adoration, because adoration (namaskāra) is dear to the pitrs. Adoration to you, O Fathers, for vigour; adoration to you, O fathers, for life; adoration to you, O fathers, for svadhū; adoration to you, O fathers, for ardour; adoration, O fathers, for the terri ble! O fathers! here is adoration to you. This (pindapitryajña) is indeed a sacrifice of men (i. e. sacrifice to departed men) and other sacrifices belong to the gods.” In the Tai. Br. I. 4. 10 the Pitryajña performed in sākamelha is praised (in 2) and further on it is said that Rtus (seasons) are pitrs and they offered pitryajña to Prajāpati, their father. This passage gupports the provision made in Manu and some of the digests that the Rtus are to be identified with pitrs and obeisance is to be made to them. %0

Pindapitryajña in sat. Br.

The Sat. Br. (II. 4. 2) contains the following somewhat fuller account of the Pinda-pitry ajña, omitting legendary or other irrelevant matters :-When the moon is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (the performer of the Darsa sacrifice) presents food to the Fathers in each month ...... He presents it in the afternoon. The forenoon indeed belongs to the gods; the midday to men; and the afternoon to the Fathers; therefore he presents (food to the Fathers) in the afternoon. While seated behind the Gārhapatya fire with his face turned towards the south and the sacred thread on his right shoulder he takes that material (for the offering from the cart). There upon he rises from thence and threshes the rice while standing north of the Dakṣiņa fire and facing the south. Only once does he clean the rice, for it is once for all that the fathers have passed away. He then boils it. While it stands on the Dakṣiņa fire) he pours some clarified butter on it. After remov ing it (from the fire) he offers to the gods two oblations in the fire ...... Here he is engaged in a sacrifice to the Fathers; hence he thereby propitiates the gods and being permitted by the gods, he presents that food to the Fathers. He offers to both Agni and Soma ... He offers with the formula To Agni, the carrier of kavya (what is offered to the Manes), svāhā!', 'To Soma accompanied by the Fathers, svāhā!' (Vāj. S. II 29). He then puts the pot-ladle (mekṣana) on the fire, that being in lieu of the Svistakřt. Thereafter he draws (with the sphya, the wooden sword) one line south of the Dakṣiņa fire, that being in lieu of the altar. He then lays down a firebrand at the further (south) end of the line, For, were he to present that food to the Fathers without having laid down a firebrand, the Asuras and Rākṣasas would certainly tamper with it. ... He lays it down with the text 'whatsoever Asuras roam about being attracted by the svadhā (offering to Fathers), assuming various shapes, be they large-bodied or small-bodied, may Agni expel them from this world (Vāj. S. II, 30)... He then takes the water jar and makes the Fathers wash (their hands) merely saying 'N. N., wash thyself' (naming) the sacrificer's father; 'N.

(naming) the sacrificer's great-grandfather. As one would pour out water (for a guest) when he is about to take food, so in this case. Now those (stalks of sacrificial grass) are severed with one stroke and cut off near the root; the top belongs to the gods, the middle part to men and the root part (of darbhas) to the fathers. Therefore they are cut off near the roots ...... He spreads them along with the line with their tops towards the south. Thereon he presents (to the fathers the three round cakes of rice). He presents thus :- for the gods they offer thus: for men they ladle out; and in the case of the fathers they do in this very way; therefore he presents (the cakes to the fathers) thus. With 'N. N., this for thee!' he presents one cake to the sacrificer's father. Some add 'for those that come after thee', but let him not say this, since he himself is one of those to whom it would be offered in common. Let him therefore merely say 'N, N., this for thee!' as to the sacrificer's father; 'N. N., this for thee' as to his grandfather; 'N. N., this for thee' as to his great grandfather...He then mutters 'Here, O fathers, regale your selves; like bulls come hither each to his own share!' (Vāj. S. II, 31). Whereby he says 'Eat each his own share'. He then turns round to the left so as to face the opposite (north) side ; for the fathers are far away from men; and thereby he also is far away (from the fathers). 'Let him remain (standing with bated breath) until his breath fail' say some; 'for thus far extends the vital energy'. However, having remained so far a moment-he again turns round (to the right) and mutters 'the Fathers have regaled themselves; like bulls they have come each to his own share' (Vāj. S.

The Katyāyana Sr. IV. 1. closely follows the Sat. Br., but adds certain details viz. he folds his hands and repeats the six mantras (Vāj. S. II, 32 'namo vah pitaro rasāya' &c.) throwing three threads on each pinda with the mantra 'etadvaḥ' (Vāj. S. II, 32) or the woollen fringe of a garment or hair from the chest of the sacrificer when he is beyond fifty years of age, sprinkling water on the pindas or on the ground near them with (Vāj. S.

This is indicated by the teacher by means of a gesture. 'He then pulls down the tuck-' The sacrificer (or adhvaryu) puts on an upper garment when the rite commences, the dasa or unwoven edge of which he tucks under the waistband, This he loosens or pulls out at this stage. It will have been noticed that the Sat, Br. in deal ing with Pindapitryajña employs Vāj. S. II, 29 (except 'apahatā asura raksāmsi vediṣadah'), 30, 31.

monthly śrāddha (māsi-śrāddha) is the prakrti of Astakā and other srāddhas in which three ancestors are to be invoked. It is as follows: Now then at a Pārvana-śrāddha, or at a śrāddha celebrated for securing some desired object, or at an Abhyu dayika-śrāddha or at an Ekoddistaśrāddha, the performer causes to sit down brāhmaṇas who are endowed with learning, moral character and proper conduct or who are endowed with ( at least) one of these three characteristics ), who have been invited already in proper time, who have taken a bath, whose feet are washed (by the performer) and who have sipped water (taken ācamana), as representatives of (or equal to) the Fathers, with their faces turned to the north, one for each of the Fathers, or two for each or three for each. The larger the number of brāhmaṇas invited the greater is the fruit or reward. But in no case (should he invite ) only one for all (the Fathers ); or he may invite only one brāhmaṇa except at the first śrāddha 967. By the exposition of the Pindapitryajña the rules for the pārvana-śrāddha have been declared. Having given water (into the hands of the invited brāhmaṇa or brāhmaṇas after they sit down) and double-folded darbha blades as a seat (on which the darbhas are to be kept), having again given water to them and having poured water into three vessels of metal (silver &c.), of stone and of earthenware or into three vessels made of the same substance (out of these three) which are covered over with darbha blades and having recited (over the water in the vessels ) the verse 'sanno &c.'

970. The rules about Pindapitryañja have been set forth in Āsv. Sr. S. II. 6. Nārāyana notes (on Āśv. gr. IV. 7.2) that Āśvalāyana treats of only the procedure relating to the rite for pitrs and that he does not at all refer to the dinner given to daiva or Vaišvadeva brāhmanas at the time of sraddha. It is therefore possible that feeding daiva brahmanas was added to the ancient ritual, though it must be said that Manu III. 125, Yaj. I. 224-28 and Vas. XI. 27 prescribe such feeding. Dr. Caland (in 'Ahnencult p. 161 ) asserts that he can prove that the detail of feeding daiva brahmanas spread from the Srāddhasūtra of Katyāyana to the other sutras and he relies on the fact that Kātyāyana (in Kandikā 2) prescribes that the viśve devāh should be invoked with the verse . Visve devāsa āgata' and the performer should mutter the verse visve devāh srnutemam' which are respectively Vaj. S. VII. 34 and XXXIII. 53. But Dr. Caland tries to prove too much. The first verse occurs twice in the Rg. (II. 41. 13 and VI 52.7) and the second occurs in Rg. VI. 52. 13, Tai. S. II. 4. 14. 5. They are not found only in the Vaj. S. as Dr. Caland seems to have thought. It is possible that other works took over those mantras from the Rgveda or the Tai. S. It may also be noted that Yāj. I. 229 mentions only 'Visve devāsa' and specifies that it is a rk (and not a mantra or yajus). So Yaj. at least does not appear to have borrowed the prescriptions of Katyayana. It is not necessary to examine the other arguments.

From considerations of space it is impossible to set out all the differences among the several grhyasūtras of the Rgveda, of the Taittiriya sākhā (viz. Baudhāyana, Āp., Hir., Bharadvāja and Vaikhānasa), of the Vājasaneya sākhā (such as Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana), of the Sāmaveda (such as Gobhila and Khādira) and of the Atharvaveda (being Kausika sūtra). A few matters may be set out by way of illustration. The Āp. gr. (21. 3-4)981 states that after the brāhmaṇas are invited for śrāddha dinner) from the food prepared for the dinner a portion is taken out in a vessel and therefrom seven āhutis are cast into the fire with the seven mantras beginning with 'yan me mātā' (in Āp. M. P. II. 19, 1-7), the first two for the father, the next two for the grand-father, next two for the great-grand-father and the 7th to pitrs in general with svāhā (but without naming any one) and then six oblations of clarified butter are offered with the six formulas beginning with 'svāhā pitre' (Ap. M. P. II. 19, 8-13). Thus the agnaukarana in Ap. consists of two parts viz, āhutis of food and of clarified butter, while in Asv. it is made only with food. Then the performer should touch all food (cooked food and the remainder of what is employed for offering into fire ) with the three mantras "esa te tata madhumān' (Ap. M. P. II. 19. 14-16), he should make the brāhmaṇas touch the food served to each with the Yajus formula 'the earth is thy vessel' (Ap. M. P. 2. 20. 1) quoted in n. 992 below. 

Ap. gr. prescribes the mantra, 'putrān pautrān' (Ap. M. P. II. 20. 24) for moistening the pindas, while Baud. gr. and Vaikhānasa gr. (IV. 6) employ the mantra "ürjam vahantir' (Vāj. S. II, 34) for the same purpose. It may be noted that 

980 a. It will be noticed that Āsv. omits several details viz. (1) he does not say that the brāhmaṇas for all the gods are to be seated, facing the east; (2) he mentions no mantra such as 'ye agnidadghã &c.;' (3) nothing is said about dakṣinā or about the performer following the brahmanas a few paces and then returning with their permission. 

981. The air. T. 20. 9 sets down the whole procedure very succinctly after the brahmanas have taken the dinner as follows: भुक्तवतोनुव्रज्य प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य वैधं दक्षिणाग्रान् वर्भान संस्तीर्य तेषूत्तरैरपो दत्त्वोत्तरदक्षिणापवर्गान पिण्डान् दत्वा पूर्ववदुत्तरैरपो तत्वोत्तरैरुपस्थायोत्तरयोदपात्रेण त्रिः प्रसव्यं परिषिच्य न्युज्य पात्राण्युत्तरं यजुरनवान वरा

these sūtras which belong to the Taittiriya sakhā employ a Verse from another recension viz. the Sukla Yajurveda. 

The Hir. Gr. (II. 10-13) is more elaborate than the Ap. Gr. and not only sets out at length many of the mantras in Āp. M. P. II. 19-20, but adds some more. The Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana (1-3) sets out the procedure of the monthly sraddha almost in the same way as the Yājñavalkyasmrti (which is set out below). It states that in the monthly śrāddha first come the daiva rites and then the various items occur as in the Pinda-pitryajña pindapitryajña-vad-upacāraḥ' (first sūtra of the 2nd kandikā). Some details which it contains (and Yāj. does not expressly mention) may be set out here. It gives in full the mantras "tilosi', 'yā divya' (both of which occur in Ašv. gr.), 'prthivi to pātram' (which is Āp. M. P. II, 20.1). It prescribes that in addition to the Gāyatri and the Madhumati verses the word 'madhu' should be repeated thrice. The holy texts to be repeated while the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating according to Kātyāyana are the Gāyatri (once or thrice), the five Rākṣoghni verses (Rg. IV. 4.1-5, Vaj. S. XIII. 9-13, Tai. S. T. 2. 14. 1-2). Purusasūkta, the Apratiratha hymn (Rg X. 103. 1-13 = Vaj. S. 17. 33-34, 46 = Tai. S. IV. 6. 4. 1-4) and others. It expressly states that the svadhāvācana (Yāj. I. 244) relates to both paternal and maternal ancestors. Besides the blessing contained in Yāj. I. 246, Katyāyana provides that the performer is to pray for and the brāhmaṇas are to pronounce two more viz. May the pitrs be kind (lit. not dreadful) to us' and 'May our family prosper'. Dr. Caland in his learned work 'Altindi scher Ahnencult' (pp. 150–152) appears inclined to hold that when a sūtrakāra has not actually said anything on certain items in the śrāddha ritual, one has no right to anticipate, on the authority of later authors, that those items existed in the times of that sūtrakāra. I demur to this conclusion. Dr. Caland has attached no weight to the fact that Jaimini (as stated in H. of Dh, vol. III p. 870) laid down the principle that one may include certain items from another sākhā. Jaimini's sūtras cannot be supposed to have laid down those propositions for the first time. Jaimini's sūtras are at least as old as some of the extant srauta sütras such as that of Katyāyana. Therefore hardly any chrono logical conclusions can be drawn with certainty from the silence of a sūtrakāra as to a certain item in the śrāddha ritual. 

We shall now turn to the metrical smrtis. Manu Treats of the procedure of $rāddha at some length in III. 208–265. But

History of Dharmaśāstra · [Vol. as the procedure prescribed by the Yājñavalkyasmrti (I. 226–249) is more compact and at the same time more lucid it is set out here. "When the invited brāhmaṇas come in the afternoon the performer having a pavitra 982 in his hand should seat them on seats and make them sip water. The brāhmaṇas invited should be even in number (2, 4 &c.) according to the performer's re sources at the daiva rite (i. e. the Vaišvadevika brāhmanas should be two, four &c.) and uneven (three or five &c.) at a (pārvana) śrāddha for the pitrs; the brāhmaṇas should be seated in a pure (cow dunged) plot screened on all sides and sloping towards the south. At the daiva (part of pārvana śrāddha when Viśve-devāḥ are to be invoked) two brāhmaṇas facing the east should sit down and three brāhmaṇas facing the north should be seated in the rite for the pitrs or only one may be seated for each (i, e, in daiva and in pitrya). The same rule applies to a śrāddha for maternal ancestors. In both (pitrśrāddha and mātāmahasraddha) the worship of Viśve devas may be performed separately or simultaneously 983.

'usantas-tvā' (Rg. X. 16. 12, Vāj. S. 19.70, Tai. S. II. 6. 12. 1), and should then recite in a low voice the mantra (āyantu nah pitarah) 'may the pitrs come to us' (Vāj. S. 19. 58). The performer, having scattered sesamum seeds all round (the brāhmanas) with the mantra 'Apahatā' (Vāj. S. II. 29), should employ sesamum for all purposes where yavas were employed in the daiva part of the ceremony) and should perform all the items such as giving arghya (water for worship) for the pitrs as before (for the daiva rite). After offering arghya water, he should collect the drops of the arghya water fallen from the hands (or fingers ) of the brāhmaṇas in one vessel (the pitr vessel), them turn it upside

In offering each of the things in daiva or pitrya rite in sraddha water must be given before and after. The मिता. says that here the method called काण्डानुसमय (and not पदार्थानुसमय) has to be followed. These two are dealt with in Jai. V. 2.1-15. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 739-740. In this case if there are three brahmanas, water, kusas and water are all to be given to one, then the same three to the second and the same three to the third This is a TVEIDHAT. If water is given one after another to the three, then kusas one after another to them, then water one after another to three, that would be पदार्थानुसमय. काण्ड means पदार्थवर्ग. EATIE (on tr. pp. 759-766) has an exhaustive and lucid discussion on these two. He states that पदार्थानुसमय is the rule but काण्डानुसमय also has to be followed in certain cases. For example, on p. 764 he says ' TOT 13ar चमनप्रदानासनोपवेशनानि पदार्थानुसमयेन । आसनक्षणावाहनार्धगन्धपुष्पधूपदीपाच्छादनानां Tariat great anugaraaraang rescatau aquateur and relies on y.

Vide आश्व. गृ. in note 966 above for शं नो देवीः, तिलोसि, या दिव्याः . The मन्त्र is 'अपहता असुरा रक्षांसि वेदिषदः (वाज. सं. II. 29). The बहचगृह्यपरिशिष्ट, अपरार्क (p.484) and others say that the name and gotra of the ancestors should be mentioned in offering पाद्य, अर्घ्य, गन्ध etc. Therefore the अय॑ will be offered in the form 'अमकगोत्र पितरमकामतत्य मा, हलायुध (folio 18a on श्राद्धसूत्र) notes that in the case of वाजसनेयs the last words are एष तेऽर्घः.

Two offerings are made with the words अझये कव्यवाहनाय स्वधा नमः, सोमाय पित मते स्वधा नमः (वाज. सं II. 29 where the same formula occurs with स्वाहा for स्वधा नमः). Acc. to Baud, Dh. SII. 8.8-11 the offerings are three viz. toसोमाय पितृपीताय, यमायाङ्गिरस्वते पितृमते, अग्नये कन्यवाहनाय स्विष्टकृते. Acc.to मद.पा. p. 590 this is peculiar to Baudhayaniyas. The ब्रह्मपुराण q. by मद. पा. (p.591) speaks of आहुतित्रय and so does Brahmānda (upodghata, 11.93-94). If the performer is आहिताग्नि and has observed सर्वाधान method he offeres into दक्षिणाग्नि: if he is not आहितानि or has followed अर्धाधान method he offers into grhya or āvasathya fire and if he has neither the srauta or gryba fire he offers into the hand of the brahmana. For the procedure of पिण्डपितृयज्ञ (which varies from one sakha and sutra to another ) vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1085-1090 and मनु III. 212 for पाणिहोम. The food offered on the hand has to be mixed with the food served in tbe plate and then eaten. When there are several pitrya brahmanas invited the TOETA is to be made on the hand of the best of the brahmanas acc, to the मद. पा.585 and स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p.462), both of which quote गोभिल II. 120 'पित्र्ये यः पडिमूर्धन्यस्तस्य पाणावनग्निमान् । हुत्वा मन्त्रवदन्येषां तूष्णीं पात्रेषु निक्षिपेत् ॥१. हलायुध holds that, since या. (10237 हुतशेषं प्रदद्यात्तु भाजनेषु समाहितः) employs the word भाजनेषु without aky quali fication, the remnants of the food for a should be put in all places including those for दैवब्राह्मणs.

After serving the food in the plates, he should invoke over the plates the mantra 'the earth is thy 992 support', he should take hold of the thumb of the brāhmanas and put it on the food (served in the plates) with the mantra 993 idam Visnur' ('Visnu strode over this' Rg. I. 22. 17, Vāj, S. V. 15, Tai S. I. 2. 13. 1). The performer should then mutter the Gāyatri verse (Rg. III. 62. 10, Vāj. S. III. 35, Tai. S. I. 5. 6. 4) together with 'Om' and the 

Vyāhrtis' and the three verses beginning with 'Madhu vāta' (Rg. I. 90. 6-8, Vāj. S. 13. 27–29, Tai. S.

It may be that the japa of sacred texts is to be done by the performer wearing the sacred thread in the upavita way as stated by Hemādri p. 1070 and the Madana-pārijāta p. 599, but the Sraddhatattva (p. 231) is opposed to this and relies on Manu III. 279.

TOTTA सप्तव्याधा इति च पठ्यते". These very verses occur in the आग्निपुराण chap. 117. -56-57. The story is very clearly set out in errat 1, Chapters 21-24 and the Matsyapurana chap. 20-21. Sever pupils of Garga guarding their guru's cow thought of eating that cow as they were famished. But the youngest said 'let us make use of the cow's flesh in sraddha, so that we may be saved from sin'. Two of the brothers became daiva brahmanas, three became pitr-brāhmanas, one became the giver and the 7th became a guest, They told the guru that the cow was eaten by a tiger. They passed through several births first as seven hunters, then deer in Kalañjara bill and so on. Sraddha ultimately saved them. The same story is narrated in Padma V. 10.49-125, and v. 47.282-304 (in which last the disciples are said to have been those of any). After becoming hamsas three of them became kings (a king and two ministers, acc. to FET) and cared not for the other world. The four others knew the path to moksa, sent word to the three with these verses saying that they four had started on the long road to the other world (Frat...arci) and asking the other three not to be immersed in the mire of wordliness (77... ). The story also occurs in the BERTIOT (SATIEAT chap. 41.24 ff). It is interesting to note that in the Jaina Uttaradhyayana-sūtra (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 56) the echoes of this story of the brothers are heard for illustrating the influence of karman,

Collecting all the cooked food (i, e. portions from each food) with sesamum mixed with it, the performer facing the south should offer the pindas near the remains of the food (eaten by the brāhmanas) according to the procedure of the pindapitryajña, For maternal ancestors also the same procedure is to be followed (from invoking the Visve devāḥ to offering pindas). Then he should give water to the brāhmaṇas for sipping. Then (he should say to the brāhmaṇas pronounce benediction'); after making the brāhmanas say svasti', he should offer water into their hands for saying 'let it be inexhaustible (after he requests them 'let it be inexhaustible'). Then after giving to the brāhmaṇas dakṣiņā (fee or presents)996 according to the ability of the performer, he should say to the brāhmanas "may I request you to repeat the word 'svadhā'” and when they permit him in the words 'do request us', he should say 'let svadhā be pronounced for the persons concerned' (ie. the pitrs and maternal ancestors). Then the brāhmanas should say 'let there be svadhā'. On the brāhmanas saying so, he should sprinkle water on the ground and say 'let the Visve devāḥ be pleased' and when the brāhmaṇas have responded with ‘let the Viśve--devāḥ be pleased' he should mutter the follow

Many of the Puranas contain detailed descriptions of the śrāddha to be performed on every amāvāsyā; for example, Matsya 17. 12-60 (closely resembling Yāj. 225-259), Vispu purāņa III. 15. 13-49, Mārkandeya 28. 37-60, Kūrma (II. 22. 20-62), Padma (srstikhanda) 9. 140-186), Brahmānda (Upod ghātapāda, chap. 12), Skanda VI. 224. 3-51, Viṣnudharmottara I. 140.6-44. The Agnipurāņa chap. 163 verses 2-42 are the same (with very slight variations and the omission of 23 verses) as Yāj. I. 227-270; while Agni chap. 117 contains many verses that closely follow the Āśv. Gr. and Yāj. Similarly the Garuda purāṇa contains numerous verses that are identical with Yājñavalkya's. For example, compare Yāj. I. 229-239 with Garuda I. 99. 11-19. The Purānas closely follow the Grhya gütras, Manu and Yājñavalkya and often employ the same mantras and formulas, though here and there they introduce some details. As remarked by the Varāhapurāṇa 14.51, the procedure for śrāddha is the same in all Purānas (iyam sarva purānesu sāmányā paitriki kriyā). For sample, a summary of the procedure in the Padma (srsti 9. 140-186) is set out here, The performer having honoured the Viśve-devāḥ (i. e. the brāh mana or brāhmaṇas invited to represent them) with a seat and with yava grains and flowers should fill two vessels with water and should place them on a pavitra of darbhas. The water should be offered with the verse 'sam no devir' (Rg. X. 9.4) and the yava grains with 'Yavogi'. They should be invoked with the verse 'Vißve devāsah' (Rg. II, 41.13) and yavas should be scat tered about with the two verses Viśve devāsah' (Rg. II. 41. 13-14) and he should scatter about yava grains with the verse thou art yava, the king of grains &c.'

He then should announce the names and gotra of his ancestors and give darbhas in the hands of the brāhmanas. He should then request brāhmanas with the words 'I shall invite the pitrs' and when they reply 'let it be so' he should invoke the pitrs with the two verses 'usantas tvā' (Rg. X. 16.12) and 'ā yantu' (Vaj. S. 19.58). Then, having offered arghya to the brāhmanas (representing the pitrs) with 'yā divyā(vide n. 985), having given them sandalwood paste and the other things including garment as the last, he should collect the remainder of the water (in the arghya vessels) into the vessel meant for the father and should keep aside the latter to the north with its top turned downwards with the words thou art a seat of the pitrs'. Then he should begin to serve various kinds of food after bringing the utensils in which the food was cooked and holding them with both hands. (Verses 157-165 speak of the various foods to be offered and the periods of gratification caused thereby to the pitrs).

May this food offered on the ground for the gratification of those that have neither father nor mother nor relative nor any other friend and have no food (offered by any one else in sraddha) proceed for union with them wherever it may have to go'! The remainder of the food cooked for sraddha and food spread on the ground are the lot (or share) of those that died without the samskāras (caula, upanayana and the like) being performed on them, that abandoned their gurus and of (unmarried) women of the family. Finding that the brāhmaṇas are satisfied (by the dinner) he should give water once in the hand of each brāhmana, should place on the ground smeared with cow's dung and urine darbhas with their ends turned to the south and place on them pindas made from all kinds of foods (cooked for the śrāddha dinner) following the method employed in Pindapitryajña after washing them with water. He should then utter the names and gotra (of the ancestors to whom the pindas are to be offered) and should offer flowers and the rest and should again wash them (pindas).

Vide I. A. vol. 16 pp. 204-207 for the grant of a village by the Chandella king Devavarmadeva in samvat 1107 (1050-51 A.D.) on the anni. versary of his mother's death and a grant in 1790 A.

"svadhā' and they should do so. Then he should request the brāhmaṇas to pronounce the following benedictions and should receive them from them while he faces the east. They are ‘May the pitrs be kind (not dreadful) to us'; the brāhmapas should say 'let it be so'; 'May our family increase!'; they should say 'so be it'; 'May donors in my family prosper and also (the study of) the Vedas and progeny and may these benedictions come out true!'; they should respond let it be so'. He should then remove the pipdas and request the brāhmaṇas to utter the word 'svasti' and they should do so. The remains of the food eaten by the brāhmanas remain (unremoved or unwiped) till the brāhmanas are dismissed; then he should perform the (usual) daily rites Vaišvadeva, balihoma1009 &c. The remnants of food that lie on the ground are the share of the group of slaves that were straight-forward and not roguish (dishonest or shirkers ). The performer holding a vessel full of water and muttering the verse 'vāje vāje' (Rg. VII. 38. 8, Vāj. S. IX. 18, Tai. S. I. 7. 8. 2) should touch the brāhmaṇas with the tip of kušas and dismiss them. He should follow them out of his house for eight paces, should circumambulate them, should then return with his rela tives, sons and wife, should then perform the daily Vaišvadeva and balihoma. Then after Vaišvadeva he should together with his relatives, sons, guests and servants partake of the food that remains in the cooking pots after what was eaten by the brāhmaṇas. 

It should be noticed how closely the Padmapurana follows the procedure (including the mantras ) contained in Yājña valkya. What procedure the author of a Purāņa follows depends upon his learning and the sūtra that he studied. For example, the Visnudharmottara 1.140 appears to rely on the Ap.gr. and the Ap. M. P. (II. 19-20), since I. 140, 12 refers to Āp. M. P. II, 19.1., 1. 140.29-30 to Ap. M. P. II. 19. 14-16, I. 140. 35 to Āp. M. P. II, 20.1. Similarly, Skanda (VI. 224. 3-51) closely follows Āśv. gr and Yāj. 

Owing to the difference in details of śrāddha in the several grhyasūtras, the smrtis and the purāņas, an important question arises whether a person should perform a śrāddha rite only in accordance with the gặhyasūtra of his own Veda or Sākhā or whether he may perform it after the inclusion (upasamhāra ) of

IV] The maxim of 'sarvasakhāpratyaya' 453 the several items found in other sütras and smrtis though not included in the kalpa or grhya sūtra of his own Sākhā. This topic is discussed at great length by Hemādri (on srāddha ) pp. 748-759 and briefly by Medhātithi on Manu II, 29 and XI.216, by the Mit, on Yāj. III. 325, Aparārka p. 1053 and others. Those who are for strictly following the details in one's own sūtra alone argue as follows: If one were at liberty to include details other than those contained in one's own sūtra, the order of the details ( krama) given in one's sutra and the time specified for each detail would be interfered with. Besides, if the addition of details were permissible, one would be liable to the charge of giving up the usages of one's own family handed down for generations. These objectors rely upon such passages as that of the Visnudharmottara which states 'He who violating (the dictates of ) his own sūtra acts according to a sutra meant for others, treats thereby his own sage ( the author of his sūtra ) as unauthoritative and incurs (the blame of) doing what is im proper.' 1010 The smrtis that contain additional details may be meant for those men who have no kalpa or grhya sütra of their own or they may be useful for Śūdras. 

Those who espouse the view that as far as possible all details found in several grhyasūtras and smrtis on one rite should be included by every one rely mainly on Jaimini II. 4. 8-33 which is called 'sakhāntarādhikarananyāya' or 'sarvasākhāpratyaya nyāya'. The principal sutra is Jai. II. 4. 9.1011 It is established in this sūtra that the prayoiana (purpose ) or phala (reward to be secured) of the rite is the same in different sūtras and smrtis. For example, the rewards of śrāddha are stated to be the same in all sūtras and smộtis (vide notes 787-790 above); then the dravya (materials) and the deity are the same (in Parvana śrāddha the deities are the paternal ancestors and the materials,

viz. kuśas, tilas, water, vessels, foods &c. are the same in all works). The effort that is enjoined the vidhi) is the same and the name (Pārvanaśrāddha, Ekoddista sraddha &c.) is the same. Therefore, on account of these various signs one easily recog nizes that the same rite is being dealt with by all sūtras, even if many of them differ in details. It cannot be said that smrtis will be useful for those who have no sutras of their own. Each man of the first three varņas is attached to some sūtra or other by the tradition of his family or caste. Similarly, the smrtis cannot be held to be meant for sūdras alone, since the smrtis mainly deal with upanayana, the study of the Vedas, agnihotra and other matters with which a sūdra has no concern. Similar ly, the objection that if details were allowed to be inserted from other sūtras and smrtis the krama and kāla prescribed in one's Sūtra might have to be set aside, the reply is contained in Jai. I. 3. 5-7 (explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 841-848 ).1012 The fruti says after getting ready a bundle of kusa grass he prepares the vedi (altar)'. Here a certain order of acts is laid down. If after a bundle of kušas is got ready, the man has a sneeze, he has to sip water (perform ūcamana ) immediately as laid down by Manu V. 145 and Vas. III. 38 before he prepares the vedi. So the objector says the krama will be interfered with. The reply is that the sequence (krama) is only a characteristic of the items in the śruti passage, that all that is meant is that the making of the altar follows the getting ready of a kusa bundle, but that it is not meant that the making of the vedi should follow immediately after the bundle is got ready. Therefore, the conclusion is that whatever detail is not in conflict with one's own sākhā or sutra may be in cluded in the rite one is about to perform, but if there is a direct conflict, then one should stick to one's own sūtra. As observed by Kātyāyana 'whatever is declared, whether in great detail or in brief, in one's own grhyasūtra about a rite, if he performs that much, it may be taken that he has done all that is required of him; but what is not handed down in one's sākhā (or sūtra) but is contained in another sākhā and is not in conflict with one's ovn sākhā, should be performed by the learned, as in the case of

agnihotra and the like'. 1013 The first verse of Katyayana may be explained as applying where one's sākhā or sūtra deals with a matter without requiring any addition or as the next best course where one is not able to supplement one's sūtra owing to some unseen cause or owing to human difficulties. The Sangraha says that where different items of the śrāddha rite are declared to be performed at different times and there is no agreement among the sages, one should follow one's grhya sutra, but where one's grhyasūtra is silent as to a certain item or as to the stage when it is to be performed, there is an option and one may follow the opinion of some gage as to that item. 1014 It appears that even the ancient grhya sūtras exhibit tendencies that led to the sarvasākhā-pratyaya-nyāya e. g. Ašv. gr. (q. in n. 966) employs several passages (such as 'Tilosi', 'Ya. divyā,' which do not occur in the Rgveda.) 

It is owing to this maxim of 'sarvasākhā-pratyayanyāya' that medieval digests go on heaping up details from all smrtis and purāṇas in their descriptions of the several šrāddhas, the procedures of which were not originally very extensive. 

The Kūrmapurāṇa 1015 provides that the performer should before noontime is past bring to his house the invited brāhmanas

This verse is गोभिलस्मृति 1.35 (reads परोक्तमविरोधि and o होत्रादिकर्मवत्), अपरार्क p.8 and स्मृतिच. I. p.5 quote this verse as कात्यायन's and also another of his 'बह्वल्पं वा स्वगृह्योक्तं यस्य कर्म प्रकीर्ति तम् । तस्य तावति शास्त्रार्थे कृते सर्वः कृतो भवेत् ॥१. हेमाद्रि (on श्रा.) p. 756 quotes this last verse as जपायन'. Both verses (बह्वल्पं० and यसाम्रातं०) are quoted as from the परिशिष्ट by हलायुध in his com. on the श्राद्धसूत्र of कात्यायन (folio 30 a). The स्मृतिच. (Ip. 5) adds another half verse of कात्यायन viz. 

आत्मतन्त्रे तु यनोक्तं तत्कृर्यापारतन्त्रिकम् ।. In आत्मतन्त्र, तन्त्र means सिद्धान्त (i.e. one's सूत्र). अग्निहोत्रादिकं यथा-This is explained by श्राद्धसौख्य (टोडरानन्द folio 64a) as follows: 'यथा छन्दोगानामनुक्तोपि यजुर्वेदविहितोग्रिहोत्राविधिः क्रियते'.. 21014. यान्यत्र कालभेदेन कर्माणि मुनयो जगुः । स्वगृह्योक्तानुसारेण विकल्पस्तेषु युज्यते॥ न गृह्यादिस्मृतिर्येषां श्राद्धादावुपलभ्यते । कर्तुमर्हन्ति ते कृत्स्नं यस्य कस्य मुनेर्मतम् ।। संग्रह q. by हेमादि (श्रा. p. 1484). The श्रा. कि. को. p. 125 briefly puts the position as follows 'आकांक्षितं परशाखोक्तमपि कर्तव्यमनाकांक्षितं तु न कर्तव्यमेव । पुराणोक्तं तु आकांक्षितमनाकांक्षितं वा सामान्यधर्मत्वात्सवेरेवानुष्ठेयम् । तत्रापि स्वशाखोक्ता विरोधिना कार्यमिति ।. The following verse quoted from Gobhila by the com, on San. Sr. S. IV. 4. 10-15 takes a very strict view 'ऊनो वाप्यधिको वापि यः स्वशाखोस्थितो विधिः । तेन सन्तनुयाद्यज्ञं न कुर्यात्पारतन्त्रिकम् ॥'.

who have shaved themselves and pared their nails, should offer them materials for brushing the teeth and request them to sit down on separate seats, then give them oil and water for bathing. It will be seen that here the purāpa has added several details that were not provided for by the Āśv. gs. (n. 966), Manu (III. 208 ), Yāj. (I. 226) and even by some of the purāņas such as the Varaha 14, 8, which begin the procedure with seat ing the brāhmanas in the afternoon on seats after welcoming them. Many more examples could be given, but that attempt is not made owing to considerations of space. 

Before proceeding to give some idea as to how the pārvana śrāddha was dealt with in medieval and modern times, observa tions must be made on several relevant matters, on which there is a difference of views or which are important in a general way. 

When the invited brāhmanas come after noon, it is pro vided in some of the purāņas that two mandalas should be made in front of the performer's residence for receiving the brāh maņas. For example, the Nāradapurāņa states1016 the mandala for a brāhmaṇa performer should be square (four cornered) in size, for a kṣatriya triangular, circular for a vaišyà and for a sūdra mere sprinkling of the ground with water is enough.' The mandalas should be made on ground smeared with cowdung and with water mixed with cow's urine. Of the two mandalas one should be on the northern side sloping towards the north and the other on the southern side sloping towards the south. On the northern mandala kuģas with points towards the east should be placed along with akṣata (unbroken or whole) grains and on southern one double-folded kusas should be placed along with sesamum grains. The northern mandala should generally be two cubits on each side while the southern one should be four cubits on each side. The brāhmana or brāhmaṇas that repre sent the Viśvedevāh should be honoured in the northern mandala first by the performer himself with water for washing their feet after bending his right knee and the brāhmaṇas representing the pitrs should be then honoured in the southern mandala with water for washing the feet (hence called padya) after bending his left knee. The mantra at the time of offering pūdya is “san

The ancient sūtras and smộtis like those of Manu and Yāj. (T. 229) say generally that the Viśvedevāḥ are to be invoked, but some of the later smrtis (such as Prajapati, verses 179-190) and purāṇas contain verses enumerating ten names of Viśve devās and assign two each (out of the ten) to five classes of śrāddhas. They say: 1018 "in śrāddha performed in an iṣti the Visvedevas are Kratu and Daksa, in a Nándimukha śrāddha they are Vasu and Satya, in Kamyaśraddha Dhuri and Locana, in naimittika śrāddha Kāla and Kāma and in Pārvana-śrāddha Purūravas and Ardrava'. According to the Sm. C. and Hemādri a seat (āsana) is to be given to the Vaišvadeva brāhmanas and invocations are to be made in the several śrāddhas after taking the names enumerated above. The Mit. on Yaj. I. 229, Hemadri (on śrāddha p. 1225) and other digests state that the mantras

The आ. प्र. p. 23 notes the different readings of some of the names such as पुरूरवस् and आर्द्रव, some saying the first is पुरूरव and the second is मादव. The printed श्राद्धतच p. 199 has माद्रव and so has टोडरानन्द (श्राद्धसौख्य folio 57 a). श्राद्धतत्व explains इष्टिश्राद्ध as इच्छाश्राद्ध and नैमित्तिक as एकोद्दिष्ट. The श्रा. क्रि. कौ. (p.56) reads पुरोरवाः and मादवाः. कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 142) reads मावश्च दशैते तु. The ब्रह्माण्डपुराण (III. 3.30-31) enumerates the ten विश्वेदेवाः somewhat differently. It reads'पुरूरवो माद्रवसो रोचमानश्च'. The ब्रह्माण्ड (III. 12.3ff.) states that ten sons were born to asar, one of the daughters of ear. When they performed severe tapas on a Himalaya peak Brahma gave them the boon they wanted (श्राद्धेश्माकं भवेदंशो ह्येष नः कांक्षितो वरः) and the pitrs agreed. The pitrs said (verse ra) 'अग्रे दत्त्वा तु युष्माकमस्माकं दास्यते ततः । विसर्जनमथास्माकं पूर्व पश्चानु दैवतम् THIS legend is obviously an attempt to explain the usage about vaisvadova brahmanas at a श्राद्ध.

for invoking the Viśvedevas in Pārvana-śrāddha are two viz. "Viśvedevāsa āgata' (Rg. II, 41.13) and 'āgacchantu mahābhāgā' (q. above in note 984), while the Sm. C. (p. 444) prescribes an additional mantra 'viśve devāḥ śruņuta' (Rg. VI. 52. 13). 

The general rule is that the Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas are to be seated facing the east and the pitrya brāhmaṇas facing the north (Yāj. I. 228, Varāha 14. 11), but there were at least five differing views about the directions which the brāhmanas were to face as Hemādri (on śrāddha p. 1200) points out. It is fur ther pointed out by Hemādri and others (like Yāj. I. 247) that in all items in the procedure of śrāddha the Vaišvadevika brāhmaṇas have precedence except in the matter of washing the hand smeared with the remains of food and the final dismissal of the brahmanas at the end of the śrāddha.1019 It may be noted that in southern and western India brāhmaṇas invited at śrāddha are worshipped, while in Bengal it is the effigy made with darbhas (darbhabatu) that is worshipped as shown by the late M. M. Haraprasad Shastri (Catalogue of Mss, vol. III p. 406). The Srāddha-tattva (folio 2b) of Raghunandana provides for the same: 'purūravā-mādravasor viśveṣām devānām pārvana-śrāddham kusamayabrāhmane karisye iti prcchet.' 

In the Vāyupurāpa 1020 it is stated that the following mantra should be repeated thrice at the beginning and end of a śrāddha and at the time of offering pindas; on repeating it the pitrs come quickly to the śrāddha and rāksasas run away and that the mantra saves the pitrs in all the three worlds. The mantra is 'Perpetual adoration to the gods, to pitrs and to the great Yogins, to svadhā, to svāhā'. The Sm. C. (on śrāddha

p. 441) states that the mantra should be repeated after the brāhmaṇas come and sit down and before kušas are placed on the seats of the brāhmanas. This mantra occurs also in Brahmapurana 220.143, Brahmānda (Upodghātapāda 11. 22), Viṣnudharmottara I. 140, 68-70 and is styled 'saptārcis' by the last two and is said to be equal to Aśvamedha. 

A certain order of words about referring to the ancestors in offering a seat, offering kuśas on seat, and arghya is laid down by Brhaspati, 1021 some of the purāṇas and the digests. As almost in every case there are different views here also. Brhaspati says: 'when giving a seat, when offering arghya, or pindas, in offering ablutions of water on pindas, the performer has to declare his relation to each of the ancestors, the names and gotras of the ancestors and also the form in which each of the ancestors is to be contemplated (viz, as Vasu, Rudra, Aditya respectively). It is further laid down that the genitive is to be employed for the ancestor's name in offering a seat ( to the pitrya brāhmaṇa) and aksayyodaka, the objective in invoking the pitrs, the dative in offering food, the vocative in other cases. 

It is laid down that the perfornier has to take ācamana (sip water) in śrāddha rite six times viz., at the commencement of śrāddha, when washing the feet of invited brāhmanas, in wor shipping them, in making the vikira, in offering pindas and at the end of the srāddha, 1022

An important question which exercised the minds of many medieval writers was 'who was the real recipient (sampradāna)1023 of the offerings made in śrāddha, whether the brāhmaṇas or the pitrs'. Relying on the words of the Āśv. gr. IV.8.1 (quoted above in n. 966 etasmin kāle ... dānam) and passages of the purāņas such as the Varāha (13. 51) 'vibhave sati viprebhyo asmān uddiśya dāsyati', the Mahārnavaprakāśa, Harihara and some others held that brāhmaṇas were the recipients, while others like Sridatta, relying on indications furnished by śruti passages like Vāj. S. 19. 36 (akṣan pitarah amimadanta pitarah) and such formulas as 'pitar-etat te arghyam' or 'etadvah pitaro vāsaḥ,' held that the real recipients intended were the pitrs, but, as the pitrs had gone to another world and could not be bodily present to receive the gifts of such things as sandlewood paste, flowers and clothes, the latter were only handed over or assigned to the brāhmaṇas who were for the moment contemplated as not different from the pitrs.1023a Vide Sm. C. (śrāddha pp. 447 449 ), Śr. Pr. pp. 30-31 for a discussion of these two view points. It should, however, be noted that the water given to the brāhmaṇas and the dakṣiņā given to them were only meant for the brāhmanas, the former for purification and the latter for the inexhaustible merit that dakṣiņā to brāhmanas conferred. 

It is to be noted that in the invocation (āvāhana) of the pitrs there is a divergence of views as to the mantras to be employed and also as to the stage when it is to be made. Hemādri (śrāddha, pp. 1254-56) states that there were five different views on the latter point, the three most important of which were that āvāhana should come before giving darbhas as āsana on the left side of the seats of the pitrya brāhmanas or after giving such darbhas or after agnaukaraña. As regards the former (viz. the mantras), Yāj. (I. 232-233), the Brahmānda purāṇa and several others say that the invocation mantra is * uśantas-tvā' (Rg. X. 16. 12, Vāj. S. 19. 70, Tai. S. II. 6.12.1) and after the āvāhana the performer should perform japa of the verse 'a yantu nah' (Vāj. S. 19.58). The Viṣnudharma sutra1024 (73. 10-12) states the performer after having received

permission from the brāhmanas should invite the Manes. Having driven away the Yatudhānas (demons) by strewing grains of sesamum and by reciting the two mantras (the first of which begins with 'may the Asuras go away) he should invite the Manes with the four mantras 'come near, ye Manes!', 'conduct them here, O Agnil', 'May my (ancestors ) come near', 'this is your (share), O Manes'. Hemādri (śrāddha pp. 1260-1267) points out how the mantras differ according to different writers. 

There is a great deal of discussion about agnaukarana men tioned in Yaj. I. 236-237. The Mit. points out that if a man has kept srauta fires by the sarvādhāna method then in the pārvaņa-śrāddha that he offers after pindapitryajña he offers homa in the Dakṣiņāgni, as he has no aupāsana (i. e. grhya) fire and supports this by quoting a passage which occurs in the Viṣnudharmottara-purāṇa,1025 But if a man consecrates the śrauta fires by the ardhādhāna 1026 method, then he has to offer pārvana homa in the aupāsana fire and one who is without srauta fires and has kept up only aupāsana fire has to offer homa in that fire. One who has neither the srauta fires nor the gļhya fire offers it in the brāhmana's hand only. The Mit. relies on Manu III. 212 and on two verses from a grhya and comes to the conclusion that one who has consecrated śrauta fires performs homa in daksina fire in the case of Anvastakya śrāddha, the grāddha on the day previous to Astakā, the sraddha

performed in the dark half of each month on some day from the 5th and in the case of pārvana-śrāddha, but he performs, in the case of kāmya, ābhyudayika, Ekoddista and Astakā śrāddhas, homa only on the pitrya brāhmana's hand; while for one who has kept no sacred fire the homa is to be made only in the pitrya brāhmana's hand. Vide Hemādri (srāddha pp. 1328-1344), Bālambhatti (on ācāra p. 518). The Todarānanda (śrāddha saukhya ) following Manu III. 282 states that one who is an Agnihotrin cannot perform a pārvana-śrāddha on any day except on darśa (i. e, on amāvāsyā). 

Another important question on which there is great diver gence concerns the number of āhutis to be offered in agnau karana, the deities to whom the homa was to be offered, the order in which the deities were to be named and the form of words to be used. On these matters there appears to have been divergent views from very ancient times. According to the Śat. Br. II, 4. 2. 12-13 the āhutis were only 1027 two, they were offered to Agni and Soma in that order and the word svāhā was used at the end. According to the Tai. Br. I, 3.10.2–3 1028 the āhutis were three, they were to be offered to Soma, Agni and to Yama in that order and the formula ended with 'svadhā namah' (and not with 'svāhā'). It is therefore that a verse of Kātyā yana 1029 says " whether to employ the word 'svāhā' or the words 

svadhā namah', whether and when to wear the sacred chord in the yajñopavīta form or prācināvita form and what was to be the number of āhutis-all these have to be understood from one's own sūtra." The difference of views which is noticed as far back as the Brāhmanas persists in the sütras, smrtis, purāṇas and is briefly indicated here. The Ap. Gr. S. (quoted above in n. 981 ) speaks of thirteen āhutis, seven with food and

IV. 7.20, Sankha Likhita 1030 Kathaka-grhya, Nārada-purāṇa (pārvārdha 28. 48 ) and Mārkandeya-purana. Three āhutis are mentioned by most of the smrtis and puranas, such as Baud. Dh. S. II. 14.7, 1031 San. Srauta IV. 3 and grhya IV. 1. 13, Visnu Dh, S. 73. 12, Manu III. 211,Varahapurana1032 (14.21-22), Brahmānda-purana (Upod ghatapāda 11.93-94), Visnudharmottara I. 140.19. It is here that various combinations of the order of the deities and of the words 'svāhā' and 'svadhā' occur. The texts of a few works are cited below for illustration. Some give the order as 'Soma accom panied by the pitrs, Agni the carrier of kavya, Yama Angiras;' while others give it as 'Agni the carrier of kavya, Soma accompanied by the pitrs, Yama Vaivasvata &c.' It is further provided that the āhuti to Agni is made to the southern side of the fire, to Soma on the northern part of it and in the middle of the two sides to Vaivasvata (Yama ).1033 

Various rules of etiquette about serving food, about the way brāhmaṇas are to eat and related matters have been laid down from ancient times and are observed even now. The Sm. C. (p. 465-470 ), Hemadri (Sraddha pp. 1367-1384), the Sr. Pr. pp. 116-123 and other digests contain elaborate rules on these matters. Yāj. I. 237 prescribes that what remains after offering homa should be served in the plates meant for the brāhmanas representing the Fathers and the plates should preferably be

of silver. Kātyāyana says that the performer who has no fire (either srauta or smārta ) should offer the homa on the hand of the most eminent among the pitrya brāhmaṇas to the accom paniment of a mantra and should offer the remainder in the plates of the other pitrya brāhmanas.1034 The Sm. C. notes that Yama and the Vāyupurāṇa say that the homa should be in the hand of the daiva brāhmana and that on account of this conflict there is an option. It is further provided that a portion of the food from which agnaukarana was effected should be kept aside for making pindas (Mārkandeya and Garuda). The food should be served by the performer himself wearing the sacred thread in the yajñopavīta form or by his wife of the same caste or by some attendant who is purified. Manu (III. 224-229, 231-233, 236-238) contains several rules 1034a 'Himself holding the vessels full of food with both hands the performer should slowly place them near the brāhmanas seated for dinner while think ing of his ancestors. That food, which is brought near the brāhmaṇas without (the containing vessel being held in ) both hands, is snatched away by wicked asuras. The per former being himself pure and concentrating his mind (only on the serving of food ) should place the vessels containing the

side dishes viz. broths, vegetables, milk, curds, gheo and honey on the ground and not on a wooden stool or the like). The vessels placed on the ground should contain various kinds of food (such as sweetmeats, pāyasa ), fruits and roots, delicious flesh, spiced or perfumed drinks. Having brought near the brāhmanas all the vessels containing food, he should serve it in the plates declaring the characteristic of each kind of food (saying this is sweet, this is sour' &c.). The performer while serving should not shed tears (remembering his ancestors ), he should not become angry, should not utter falsehood, he should not touch the vessel containing ) food with his foot and should not serve food with a violent jerk. Whatever is liked by the brahmanas should be served to them without any grumbling and he should talk about Brahma (or about Vedic riddles ), because that is agreeable to the pitrs. The performer himself, being pleased, should ( by his sweet speech ) gladden the brāhmaṇas, should make them partake of food without hurry, and should urge them on frequently (to take more food) by declaring the good points of the various items of food. All food should be steaming hot and the brāhmaṇas should partake of it silently and should not themselves speak of the good points of the food even when questioned by the performer. When the food is hot, when the brāhmaṇas eat in silence and when the good qualities of the food are not declared by the brāhmapas, the Fathers partake of it. When a brāhmana (at a śrāddha dinner) partakes of food, having his head covered with a garment (a turban &c )or facing the south or having his sandals on, evil spirits partake of the food (and not the Fathers).' As early as Gaut., it is provided that the food for the brāhmanas should be of the highest sort and should be enriched by condiments and flavoured. 

Some of the other rules are : The Prajāpati-smrti (verses 57-62 ) states who should cook the food for the śrāddha dinner. The wife, any fortunate (or handsome) woman of the performer's gotra whose husband is living and who has a son or brother and is devoted to waiting upon her elders, the performer's teacher's wife, his maternal uncle's wife, paternal or maternal aunt, his sister, his daughter or daughter-in-law, all of them having their husbands alive, should engage in the cooking, of the food for śrāddha. Women of good family, who hayo a large progeny, whose husbands are alive and who are about 50.yoats old or these women if they have become widows, and the wife of one's paternal uncle or brother, one's mothers (natupator

step-mothers ) and the mothers of one's father may cook the śrāddha food and also a woman of the same gotra who is mild by temper. In the Anušāsana parva (92.15) it is stated that a woman belonging to a gotra other than that of the deceased should not be employed for cooking śrāddha food. One's brother, paternal uncle, brother's son, sister's son, one's son, pupil, one's daughter's son or daughter's husband may also engage in cook ing the śrāddha food, but not a woman who wears a white and wet garment, who has let her hair loose, who does not wear a bodice, who is ill or who has bathed her head. Before the brāhmanas begin to eat, the food should be first served in the plates for the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas and then in those of the pitrya brāhmaṇas (Viṣnu Dh. S. 173. 13-14), but once the brāhmaṇas have begun to eat there is no such precedence; what ever each brāhmaṇa may be noted as requiring should be served to him (as indicated by Manu III, 231). The performer of the śrāddha when serving food to the brāhmanas (including pitrya) wears his sacred thread in the upavita form. Though it is said that the food should be hot, that does not apply to such eatables as curds, fruits and roots and flavoured 1035 drinks (as Sankha XIV.13 and Skandapurāṇa say ). As Hemādri (śrāddha p. 1371) points out, the serving of food in a śrāddha rite should be done with the right hand supported by the left; besides, nothing should be served with the bare hand or with a single hand, but with a wooden ladle or other utensil (but not an iron one). All cooked food, all side dishes and ghee should be served with a ladle (and not with the bare hand) but not water or eatables like laddus. No salt was to be directly served (Vispu Dh. S, 79.12). In Kātyāyana's Srāddha-sūtra it is provided 1036 "The food that remains after agnaukarana should be served in the plates of the pitrya brāhmaṇas and the performer should touch

each plate for those brāhmanas after repeating the mantra 'the earth is thy vessel, the sky is the cover, I offer nectar in the brāhmana's nectar-like mouth; svāhā'. Then the performer plunges the right) thumb of the pitrya brāhmana in the food (the remains of the homa in fire) with the rk or yajus addressed to Viṣnu; and after scattering sesamum grains all round the place where the dinner is to go on with the mantra 

the asuras and rāksasas) are struck and driven away' he (the performer ) should serve hot food very much liked (by the departed or by the brāhmaṇas)". Yāj. I. 238 briefly refers (as translated above ) to the mantras and the item of plunging the thumb of the brahmanas in the food; and so does the Baud. Dh. S. also (II.8.15-16). The Kalika-purana prescribes1037 that the thumb of the brāhmaṇa should be moved about in the food covered with ghee and honey with the mantra “the earth is thy vessel &c.' because Viṣnu in the form of the thumb protects food meant for sacrifices to gods and manes. The Baud. Pitsmedhasūtra provides that while plunging the thumb of the brāhmaṇa in the food served it should be so arranged that the nail of the thumb is not smeared with food. 1038 Vasistha provides that the brāhmanas eating grāddha food should always hold the plate from which they are eating with (the left ) hand till the end of the dinner. Sankha-Likhita provide 1039 that brāhmaṇas (eating sraddha food ) should not declare the good or bad points of the food served, should not say what is untrue, should not praise each other, nor should they say there is plenty of food and drink (and so do not serve more food ),

except by signs made with the hand.' Whatever is offered in a brahmana's hand (by way of agnaukarana) and whatever food is placed in the plates should be mixed up and eaten Hemādri quotes passages from the Maitrāyaniya-sūtra and from the Skandapurāņa setting out the mantras wherewith certain articles were to be served; e. g. the Skandapurāṇa says that pāyasa should be served with the verse 'namo vah pitaro' (Vāj. S. II. 32. Tai. S. III, 2.5.5), clarified butter with the mantra Tejosi sukram', curds with the mantra "dadhikrāvno' (Rg. IV. 39.6, Vāj. S. 23. 32, Tai. S. 1. 5. 11. 4). Ap. Dh, S. (II. 8. 18. 11) provides that the leavings of a śrāddha dinner should not be given to one who is inferior to the invited brāhmanas in qualities and Manu III, 249 states that the man who after eating śrāddha dinner gives the leavings to a śüdra falls in the Kālasūtra Hell. 

The Matsyapurāṇa and some other works provide that the brāhmaṇas should pronounce blessings on the performer (who faces the east) after they have sipped water and have been given water, flowers and akṣata grains. The performer prays 'May our Fathers be not terrible (i, e, be kind) to us. The brāhmanas reply "let it be so'. The performer prays 'May our family grow', 'May donors increase in our family and also food', ‘May these blessings turn out to be true'. To all these the brāhmanas reply after each one of the prayers 1040 "May it be so'. There are rules about the time when the leavings or particles of food in the plates of the brāhmanas that ate the dinner should be removed or swept away. Vas. (XI. 21-22) and the Kūrma purāņa provide that the leavings of food should not be removed till the Sun sets, since streams of nectar flow from them, which are drunk by the spirits of) those departed persons for whom no water was offered. Manu III. 265 (which is the same as Matsya 17.56 and Padma, Srstikhanda 9.185) provides another rule that the leavings of the food in the plates may remain where they are till the brāhmapas are dismissed and depart.

Hemadri (Sraddha, p. 1512 )1041 therefore provides that if the per former has another house the leavings may not be removed till sunset, but if he has only one house, they may be removed after the brāhmanas have gone away (vide Yāj. I. 257, Matsya 17.56 ). It is further provided by Brhaspati 1042 that the plates should not be removed before the brāhmanas pronounce the word 'svasti', and Jatākarnya 1043 and the Skandapurana say that the plates and the leavings should be removed by the performer himself or by his pupil or son, but not by women nor by a child nor by one who is not of the same caste. Manu III. 258 provides that, after the brāhmanas have left, the performer should look at the south and pray to the pitrs for certain blessings contained in Manu III, 259 which are the same as Yāj. I 246 translated above (vide p. 447), Visnu Dh. S. 73.28, Matsya 16.49-50. The Ap. gr. 20.9 (q. in note 981), Ap. Dh. S. II. 7. 17.16, Manu III, 264, Yāj. I. 249 provide that the performer should partake of the remainder of the food cooked for the śrāddha along with his wife, paternal and maternal relatives after recit ing (according to Haradatta) the Yājusa mantra (Ap. M. P. II. 20.26) which means 'entering the life breath I offer nectar; my soul is centred in Brahman for the sake of immortality. The Ap. gr. and Ap. Dh. S. provide 1044 that the performer must eat at least a morsel of the food left after serving to the brāhmanas. Vyāsa and Devala prescribe that on the day of śrāddha the per former must not observe a fast (even if he usually does so as on Ekādaśī or Sivarātra). A way out was provided by the Bra hmavaivarta-purana by recommending that the performer should merely smell the remnants of the śrāddha food. Vide

Hemādri (p. 1485) refers to the practice (observed even now) that after the performer receives the blessings referred to above, his son, grandson and the like should offer adoration to the devatās in the form of pindas. The brāhmaṇas should praise the good characteristics of the food served at the end of the grāddha ceremony. 1045 The brāhmaṇas should not get up from the dinner, carelessly leaving remnants of food in their plates, but they may leave in the plates a little food except milk, curds, honey or barley flour. 1046 

There were several views as to the exact stage at which the offerings of pindas were to be made. According to Sān. Gr. IV. 1.9., Āśv. gr. IV. 8. 12, 1047 Sankha 14.11, Manu III. 260-261, Yāj. I. 242 and several other works, the performer offers the lumps of boiled rice after the brāhmaṇas have finished eating their dinner. The pindas are made with boiled rice mixed with sesame and are placed on darbhas on a clean spot and at a distance of about one aratni from 1048 the plates in which the brāhmanas ate and the performer faces the south. Here again there are two opinions, one being that pindas were to be offered before the brāhmaṇas sip water (perform ācamana) after dinner (e. g. āśv. gr. IV. 8. 12–13, Srāddha-sūtra of Kātyāyana, kaņdikā 3), while others hold that they were to be offered after the brāhmaṇas have rinsed their mouth and taken āca mana. Another view referred to as the view of some by Sān. gr. IV. 1.10 and Manu III, 261 was that pindas were to be offered to the ancestors first after honouring the invited brāhmaņas or after agnaukarana and then the brāhmaṇas were to partake of the dinner.

Time of offering pindas

Brahmāndapurāṇa 109 emphatically asserts that this is the correct position as stated by Brhaspati. The Visnu Dh. S. (73 15-24) provides that the pindas are to be offered to the ancestors while the brāhmaṇas are actually eating. A fourth view is that of the Ap. gr. 24.9, Hir. gr. (II. 12.2-3) which state that the per former1050 should, after the brahmanas have eaten and gone away and he has followed and circumambulated them, offer pindas. Owing to this conflict of views Hemādri (quoting smrti) and the Madanapārijāta (p. 600) say that each one should follow the procedure laid down in his own sākhā.1051 Hemādri adds that those in whose grhyasūtra no special time is mentioned for pindadāna should follow the view that pindas are to be offered after the brāhmanas have partaken of the dinner and sipped water. The Sr. P. (p.247) endorses this view.1052 The pindas were to be deposited on bunches of (25) darbhas for each pinda. Aparārka on Yāj. I. 24 states that in all cases without exception piņdas were to be offered near the plates from which the brāhmanas took their meals, while Hemādri who relies on Katyayana's word 'ucchistasannidhau' says that where the performer is an āhitāgni the pindas were to be offered near his sacred fire, but when a performer had not kept the sacred fires pindas were to be offered near the plates from which brāhmaṇas ate the śrāddha food. The Śrāddhasāra (p. 163) quotes Atri to the effect that pindas should be offered at a distance of three aratnis from where the brāhmaṇas ate the śrāddha dinner and that in such śrāddhas as Navaśrāddhas Vaišvadeva is to be performed before piņdadana and that it is to be performed after

There is another conflict of views as regards the ancestors to whom pindas are to be offered at the śrāddha on amāvāsya. Most of the ancient Vedic works refer only to the three paternal ancestors as the devatās of the Pārvana-śrāddha and not to any other relatives. The three paternal ancestors are separately the devatās of śrāddha and not cumulatively, as indicated by the Āśv. Srauta II. 6.15 and Viṣnu Dh. S. 73.13-14. The important questions are whether the wives of the paternal ancestors, viz, the mother, the grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother were associated with their husbands in ancient times and secondly, whether the three paternal ancestors of one's mother viz. the maternal grandfather, the maternal great-grandfather and the maternal great-great-grandfather were invoked together with their wives in the Pārvana. The answer to both these questions so far as the Vedas and Brāhmanas are concerned is in the negative, Vide Tai. S. I. 8. 5.1, Tai. Br. I. 3. 10, II, 6. 16, Vāj. S. 19. 36-37, Sat. Br. II, 4.2. 16, in all of which the only persons expressly named are the pitrs and three paternal ancestors. It may be noted, however, that in Vāj. S. 9. 19 (which is cited by Kātyāyana at the end of Srāddhasūtra 3 as the mantra to be recited when following the brāhmaṇas that are dismissed) there is a clear reference to paternal ancestors and also to mothers. Almost all sūtras also are silent as regards the invocation of the maternal ancestors in Pārvaņa-śrāddha along with paternal ones. Vide 1053 Āśv. Śr.; Sudargana on Ap. gr. VIII. 21. 2 states that the Sūtrakāra and Bhāsyakāra did not speak of Mātāmahaśrāddha as it is not obligatory for a daughter's son to offer it. The Srāddhasutra of Katyāyana 1054 speaks of three pindas being made for the paternal ancestors and three for the mother's paternal

IV1 Ancestors to whom pindas were offered 473 ancestors. The Gobhilasmrti provides 1055 that six pindas should be offered except in the Anvastakāśrāddha, the first śrāddha (on the 11th day), the sixteen śrāddhas and the yearly śrāddha for a deceased person. Dhaumya 1056 prescribes that where the paternal ancestors are honoured (or fed) the mater nal ancestors also should be certainly honoured without making any difference (between the two classes ); if he makes a dis tinction the performer will go to Hell. The Viṣnupurāṇa, 1057 the Brahmāndapurana and the Varāhapurāṇa say that some hold that a śrāddha for maternal ancestors is to be performed separately while other sages hold that one śrāddha is to be offered at the same time to the paternal and maternal ancestors. Bphaspati (q. by Kalpataru on śrāddha p. 204) prescribes 1058 that one should offer pindas made from all food cooked for the śrāddha and mixed with honey and sesamum grains for both paternal and maternal ancestors according to the rules of one's grhyasūtra. The Varāhapurāṇa (14. 40-41) says that pitrya brahmanas should be dismissed first and then the daiva brāh manas together with those for the mother's ancestors and that separate pindas were to be offered to the mother's paternal ancestors (14.37). Some held the view that the offering of pindas to maternal ancestors was obligatory for the putrikā putra 1059 (son of the appointed daughter) or for a daughter's son that inherited the wealth of his maternal grandfather. Br̥hat-Parāśara (chap. V. p. 153) montions several views on this point. It seems probable that when the appointment of a

daughter as a son became rare or went out of vogue the maternal ancestors came to be associated with the paternal ancestors in pārvana-śrāddha. 

The question when the wives of ancestors became associa ted with the male ancestors cannot be solved satisfactorily. The pitāmahi is not mentioned in the extant. Vedic Literature. But it is certain that the wives of male ancestors had come to be associated with their husbands in the sutra period. For example, the Hir. Gr. II, 10 associates the mother, the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother with their respective husbands in the monthly śrāddha performed in the dark half. Similarly, the Baud. gr. II. 11.34 not only associates in the Astakā śrāddha the male maternal ancestors with the male paternal ancestors, but also their respective wives. The Āp, M. P. 1060 has mantras referring to the three male paternal ancestors as well as their wives. The Sān. gr. (IV. 1.11) pro vides that behind the lumps for the paternal ancestors the per former places the lumps for their wives, putting something between the two sets of pindas and the commentator explains that darbhas are placed between the two sets. The Kausika sūtra (88.12) also provides for the offering of piņdas to the wives of male ancestors to the south of the pindas for male ancestors. The Āśv. gr. (II. 5. 4-5), while speaking of the Anvas takya rite, refers to pindas to be offered to the wives of ances tors with the addition of rum and the scum of boiled rice. The Vaikhānasa-smārta-sūtra IV. 7 (after describing the Pinda pitryajña in IV.5-6) notes that the difference between it and the ordinary monthly sraddha is that in the latter pindas are offered to the wives of the pitrs 1061. Dr. Caland (in 'Ahnencult' p. 164) thinks that this inclusion of the women ancestors among those to whom pindas were to be offered was made by taking over from Anvastakya ceremonial described above. This con jecture does not look very probable. The Astakā rites existed from remote antiquity as shown above. If the offering of pindas to women ancestors were borrowed from the Anvastakya

Participation of females in pindas offered 

475 

this item would have figured in all sūtras just as Astakā śra ddha does. It is rather more probable that the extension to women was a natural growth in course of time. Some of the smrtis emphasize the participation of the wives of paternal ancestors in the pārvanasroddha offerings. Satatapa states 1062 : "In what is offered to the pitrs after Sapiņdikarana, the mother is a participant everywhere. A śrāddha may be separately offered to the mother in the Anvaṣtakā rites, in Vrddhi-śrāddha, at Gayā and on the anniversary of the day of her death; but in other cases it is performed along with the husband'. It is stated by Brhaspati that the mother partakes of the śrāddha food along with her husband (i. e. the father of the performer); that the same rule applies to the paternal grandmother and the paternal great-grandmother 1063. The Kalpataru 1064 and others held that the wives of the paternal ancestors were not devatās in the pārvaņa-śrāddha, but they only enjoyed the ethereal food which came to the pitřs, while Hemādri and other sou thern writers held that the mother and other female ancestors were among the devatās of pārvaņa-śrāddha, but not the step mother. There was a divergence of views whether the words 'mother', 'paternal grandmother' and 'paternal great-grand-- 

mother' included the co-wives(sapatnis) of these, Hemadri (on śrāddha pp. 97-104) has a long disquisition on this question. According to one view the step-mother, the co-wife of the pita mahi and the co-wife of the prapitāmahi would be included in

the presentation formula (as quoted below), while according to Hemādri only the real mother, the real paternal grand-mother and the real paternal great-grandmother would ordinarily be included except on rare occasions such as a Mahālayaśrāddha or a śrāddha at Gayā, 1065 

As regards the mantra to be recited when offering each of the pindas there is some divergence of views, which reaches far into antiquity. The pinda 1066 is offered to each ancestor after stating his gotra, his relationship to the performer and name (all in the vocative). According to several writers the form of the presentation of the pinda is 'this is for thee, O Father! N. 

N. (by name) and so and so by gotra.' In the Tai. S. I. 8.5 1, in the Ap. M. P. II. 20.13 and in some sutras, the following is added 

and for those who follow thee' (ye ca tvām-anu). 1067 In the Gobhila-grhya IV. 3.6 and Khādiragrhya the formula is still longer 'This pinda is thine, O fatherland of those who follow thee and of those whom thou followest. 1068 To thee, Svadha!'. The Bhāradvaja 1069 gr. II. 12 introduces slight changes. It has been already noted above (n. 781) how the Sat. Br. disapproves of

Mantras at offering pindas 

477 

- the usage of the Tai.s. in this matter, the reason being 10ro that when the son offers a pinda to his father and employs the formula 'this is thine and of those that follow thee, he would be included among those that follow the father and be thus offering a pinda to himself, which is inauspicious. It is provided by Gobhila-grhya 1071 that if he does not know the names of his ancestors he should put down the first pinda with the Formula 

svadhā to the Fathers dwelling on the earth', (he should put down) the 2nd pinda with the formula 'svadhā to the fathers dwelling in the air', the third with the formula ‘svadha to the Fathers dwelling in heaven' and should recite in a low voice the words 'Here, O Fathers, gladden yourselves, show your vigour each according to his own part.' Yama quoted by Kalpataru (on Sr. p. 203), following Gobhila provides generally (whether the ancestors be known or not) that the first pinda should be offered to the father with the expression prthivi', the second to the grandfather in the aerial regions and the third to the paternal great-grandfather with the mantra 'dyaur darvi'. The Visnu Dh.S. (73.17-19) has similar provisions, the mantras respectively being prthivi darviraksita', 'antariksam darvi raksita,' dyaur-darviraksita'. Medhatithi on Manu III. 194 says (following ASv. Sr. and others) that if the names of the ancestors are not known he should simply say “O Father, Grandfather' &c. If the gotra be not known then he should employ the gotra name Kaśyapa. 1072 

Certain matters pertaining to pindas must be stated in one place once for all. There is a good deal of discussion about the

undried āmalaka fruit, of the size of a bilva fruit in Ekoddista, - in navaśrāddhas the pinda should be bigger than in any one of 

the preceding when offered every day during the days of impu rity on death. The Skandapurāņa says that pindas should be of such a size as would enable a calf two years old to put it easily into its mouth. 1073 Angiras (q. by Sm. C. p. 475 and Hemādri, śrāddha p. 1429) prescribes that the pindas may be of the size of kapittha or bilva fruit or of the size of a hen's egg or of an āmalaka or badara fruit. In the Maitrāyaṇīya-sūtra 1094 it is said that the pinda for the paternal grandfather should be bigger than that for the father and should be in the middle (of the three pindas), that the pinda for the great-grandfather should be the largest of all. The next point is from what materials the pindas were to be made. If pindas were offered before agnau karana they were to be made from the boiled rice (caru) prepared for agnaukarana. If made after agnaukarana, the pindas were to be made from the cooked food (remaining after agnaukarana) mixed with sesamum (vide Yāj. I. 242). If pindas were to be offered after the brāhmanas took their dinner, the pindas were to be made from the remainder of the food cooked for the brāhmaṇas which was to be mixed with the boiled rice for agnaukaraña as stated in Kātyāyana's Srāddha sūtra 1075 The pindas were to be placed according to the Matsya 1076 on darbhas spread on the ground cleaned with water mixed with cow's dung and urine. There were others such as Devala, the Brahmapurāņa and Bhavisyapurāṇa that prescribed that an altar, either circular or square, of sand was to be raised on ground 4 fingers in height and one cubit in extent near the plates from which brāhmaṇas were to eat and thereon darbhas

were to be placed and then pindas. The Vāyupurāņa provides that a line should be drawn on the altar or the ground with the root of a darbha to the accompaniment of the following mantras viz, 1077 I destroy whatever is impure; I have killed all asuras, danavas, raksasas, yaksas, pisacas(goblins), guhyakas and yātudhānas' and the mantra 'struck down are the asuras and raksasas sitting on the Vedi)'.

S. II. 32) 1078 and the repetition of three mantras when each of the three pindas is offered, some holding that the seasons were to be deemed as identified with 'rasa', sosa' and four other words (in Vaj. S. II. 32), while others held that the adoration of the seasons is quite distinct from the namaskāras to the pitrs. In the Saunakātharvanaśrāddha-kalpa, the pindas are offered in the reverse order i. e. first to the great-grand father, then to the grandfather and then to the father (Hemādri on śrāddha p. 1442). Ap. Sr. I. 9. 4 refers to this method in 'pitamahaprabhrtin va'.

About the final disposal (pratipatti) of the pipdas several views were entertained. We have already seen (note 780 ) that the Vāj. S. and several sūtras provided that the middle one of the three pindas for paternal ancestors was to be eaten by the wife of the performer of the śrāddha if she was desirous of a son. Manu (III. 262-263) provides that the dharmapatni (i. e, a wife of the same varpa and married before any other wife ) should eat the middle pinda with the mantra 'ādhatta pitaro garbham' (q. in n. 780) and then she gives birth to a son who lives long, secures fame, is intelligent and obtains wealth and progeny and who is of a good and righteous turn of mind. The same rule is provided for by the Laghu-Ašvalāyana 23.83, the Kūrma II. 2. 71, 76, Matsya 16,52, Vāyu 76,31, Viṣnudharmottara I. 1718, 220, 149, Padma (srstikhanda 9.121) and other purāņas. As regards pindas in general, the Āśv. Sr. (11. 7. 14-17) says that the other two pindas (except the middle one ) should be cast into water or in fire or they may be eaten by a brāhmana who has suddenly developed a distaste for food or they may be partaken by one who has been suffering from a serious disease (such as tuberculosis or leprosy ) and that in the latter case the man either recovers or dies. The Gobhila-gr. (IV. 3, 31-34) provides that the pindas should be thrown into water or in fire or should be given to a brāhmaṇa or a cow to eat. Manu (III. 260-261 ) says the same and adds that they may be given to a goat for eating and that some allow them to be devoured by birds. Yāj. I. 257, Matsya 16.52-53, and Padma1079 mention the same five ways of disposal but the last adds one more viz. placing them near a mound of earth. The Varaha purāņa 1080 (190.121 ) says that the performer may eat the first pinda himself, he should give the middle to his wife and the third he should cast into water. The Anušāsanaparva (125.25.26) provides that the first and the third should be thrown into water or fire and the middle pinda should be eaten by the wife. It is provided by Bịhaspati that if the wife is suffering from a disease or is already pregnant or is staying in some other

place, then an old bull or a goat may eat the middle pinda (quoted by Sm. C. on Sr. p. 486, Kalpataru on Śr. p. 224). The Viṣnudharmottara (I. 141, 8) prescribes that when a śrāddha is performed at a tirtha, the pindas should be cast into the sacred water. The Anušāsanaparva 125. 38-40 and some of the purāṇas such as Vāyu (76.32-34 ) and Brahma (220.150–152) provide that certain consequences follow from the disposal of pindas in one way or another viz. the best worlds by giving pindas to cows, intellect and fame from casting into water, long life from offering them to birds &c. Vide also Brahmānda (upodghāta, chap. 12. 31-35) which provides that if given to cows the result is best complexion, if to cocks then delicacy. long life if given crows. In this connection it should be noted that pindas of rice or of flour were not to be offered in all śrāddhas. The Śrāddha-kalpalatā (pp. 86-89 ) has a long discussion about the śrāddhas in which the offering of pindas of food is forbidden. For example, it quotes Pulastya to the effect that in śrāddhas performed on the two ayana days, on the two equinoctial days, on any sankrānti, no pindas are to be offered, so also in śrāddhas on Ekādasi, Trayodasi, on Maghā and Kr̥ttikā nakṣatras, if a man desires to have sons and wealth. 

On the question as to what is the principal item in the śrāddha there are three views. Some, like Govindaraja, 1081 hold that feeding of brāhmaṇas is the principal thing and they rely on Manu III. 129 which says 'One may feed even a single learned brāhmaṇa in a rite for gods and manes and not many who do not know vedic mantras; by doing so he reaps abundant reward'. Here the reward or fruit is associated with feeding a learned brāhmaṇa. There is a maxim 1082 of the Pürvamimāṁsā that whatever is mentioned in proximity with an action that has a reward or fruit but has no special reward of its own, is subsidiary (anga) to what is declared to have a reward.' Besides, there is no pindadāna in certain śrāddhas such as āmasrāddha, śrāddha on the Yugādi days.1083

Others like Karka hold the view that pindadāna is the principal item in śrāddha. They rely upon the fact that in the śrāddha at Gayā it is the offering of pindas that is the most important matter and upon the fact that in the Visnudharmasūtra (78. 52-53, and 85. 65-66) and in several Purānas such as the Varāha (13.50), Visnu (III. 14.22-23), Brahma (220.31-32), Visnu dharmottara (I. 145.3-4) the pitrs are stated to have expressed a deep yearning for a son who would offer them pindas at Gayā and water on sacred rivers &c. (vide note 911). Further support is sought for this view in the fact that in the śrāddha on the birth of a son and in śrāddha offered even by a good Śūdra the feeding of brāhmanas is forbidden, A third view is that both the feeding of brāhmanas and the offering of pindas are the principal matters in a śrāddha. The Gobhila-smrti, after stating 1084 the other two views and some of the reasons therefor, tells us that the author of it is himself in favour of this third view. In cases where the word śrāddha is employed and there is neither brāhmana feeding nor pindadāna as in Daiva srāddha, the word śrāddha is applied in a secondary sense (gauna). Vide Hemādri (śraddha) pp. 157-160. In the Dharmapradipa it is said that among the followers of the Yajurveda (i. e. Vājasaneyins) the offering of pindas is principal, among the followers of the Rgveda the feeding of brāhmaṇas is principal, while among the followers of the Sāmaveda both are principal. In this way śrāddha partakes of two characters viz. it is a yāga (sacrifice) and also 1085 a gift (dāna). Haradatta, Hemādri, Kapardi and others appear to hold that all three (bhojana pindadāna and agnaukaraña) are principal. Vide Samskāra ratnamālā p. 1003.

the hand of the performer of śrāddha); the father, (the grand-father and great-grandfather) are entitled to the piņda; the offerer of the pinda is the 7th; thus sapinda relationship extends to seven generations 1086 The Mārkandeya-purāpa states that three ancestors beginning from the paternal grand father of the paternal grandfather enjoy the wipings (of the hand of the performer when he offers pindas). 1087 The Brahma purāņa (220. 84-86) has similar verses. Manu provided 1088 that the performer should place three pindas on darbhas and then wipe off from his hand the particles of food and water sticking to it with the roots of the darbhas (on which the pindas were placed) and that such wipings are meant for those who are called 'lepabhāgin' (the three paternal ancestors after the paternal great-grand-father). Similar provisions are made by the Visņu Dh. S. 73.22, Varāhapurāņa 14,36, Garudapurāņa (Acārakānda 218.24), Kūrma II. 22.52. Medhātithi on Manu III. 216 says that even if no food or water sticks to the hand still the performer rubs the hand against the roots of the dar bhas on which the first pinda was placed. A special rule was provided by Devala quoted in Srāddhakalpalatā (p. 14) that if the father or mother became a mleccha (by forcible or volun tary conversion &c.) one should not observe any impurity for him or her and no śrāddha should be offered and when offering the three pindas in place of the father the name of Visņu should be uttered. 

'One question that exercised the minds of well-known writers was whether the daily Vaišvadeva should be performed before starting the brāddha ceremonies or after the latter were finished. We have to remember first that several works state that rites for pitrs deserve pre-eminence over those for the

gods 1089. Manu (III. 265 ) states 1090 that after the brāhmanan have been dismissed the performer of śrāddha shall offer the (daily) domestic bali offering and that this is the settled rule of dharma. Medhātithi explains that the word 'bali' is merely illustrative. The Matsyapurāņa 1091 17.61, the Varāha purāṇa (14.43), Skanda VII. 1. 266. 101-102, Devala, Kārsnājini and others provide that after the rites for the fathers are finished Vaisvadeva should be performed. When Vaišvadeva is performed after the completion of śrāddha rites, it is to be offered from the food that remains after being utilized for the śrāddha dinner. But Hemādri (pp. 1058-1065) holds a long discussion and arrives at the following conclusions. In the case of an āhitāgni (p. 1064), Vaišvadeva is to be performed before śrāddha except in the case of the śrāddha on the 11th day after death. In the case of one who has not kept the sacred fires there are three optional times for Vaišvadeva, viz. after agnau karaṇa or after the vikira (scattering of food on darbhas for those dying without the sařskāras being performed for them), or after the brāhmanas are dismissed on the completion of the śrāddha (p. 1064). If Vaišvadeva is to be performed before śrāddha or in the midst of it, then the cooking of food must be done separately for Vaišvadeva and for śrāddha. In the case of all, whether sāgnika or anagnika, Vaišvadeva must be performed with the remainder of the food left after use in śrāddha, if the former is performed after the latter. There were sages like Paithīnasi1092 that held that Vaišvadeva should not be performed with the food cooked for sraddha without first offering the food to the brāhmanas invited for srādda dinner i. e. Vaišvadeva must be performed after śrāddha if the same food is to be used

for the former. The Nirpayasindhu (III. p. 459 ) states that as most smrtis place the performance of Vaišvadeva after śrāddha and as many writers of commentaries and digests such as Medhātithi and Smộtiratnāvali do the same all should perform Vaišvadeva after finishing śrāddha. 

It is now necessary to illustrate how pārvana srāddha is performed in modern times. Here the greatest variety prevails. The details of the rite vary in the different parts of India. They vary also according as the performer belongs to a particular Veda or a particular recension of the Veda, they vary according to the particular eminent writer that is followed and further additions are made according as the performer is a Vaispava or a Saiva. Such differences have to be passed over here, particularly because they are not material. We saw above that the Pārvana-śrāddha was very simple in the days of the Brāhmaṇas and most of the sūtras. There was then no express mention of the worship of Viśvedevāḥ in Pārvana śrāddha, or of the maternal ancestors or of the wives of any ancestors. Gradually these came to be added and by the time of the Yājñavalkyasmrti there was special invocation of the Viśvedevāḥ. But these latter were probably not expressly divided into groups at the time of that work. During the smrti period groups of Viśvedevāḥ came to be assigned to different kinds of śrāddhas (vide p. 457 note 1018). The Purāpas pres cribed several Paurānic mantras for being recited during the śrāddha rite, such as the verse Sāgacchantu' (note 984) and the verse 'devatābhyah pitrbhyasca' (p. 458 note 1020). Then there arose the principle of the Pūrvamiņāmsā that all rites described in the different sākhās and sūtras constitute but one rite, and that one may take over from another sākhā or sūtra details described therein, which are not opposed to one's own sākhā or sutra (vide pp. 453-55 notes 1011-1013). This principle tended to make the śrāddha rites all inclusive and the whole procedure became swollen to an enormous extent. How even the slightest variation causes difference in the details may be illustrated by an example. In Mithilā villages even among poor men eleven brāhmaṇas are invited for pārvapa-śrāddha, but it is often difficult to secure a very learned man (who is called pātra or mahāpātra) to officiate. In such a case where a mahapatra or a pātra brāhmana is not available the śrāddha be called apātraka-pārvanaśrāddha (for which really there is nouśastric authority) and is distinguished from the sapātraka pārvana śrāddha in several matters, two of which in the case of the

Vājasaneyins may be stated here. Though the Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana, which is of special authority among Vājasaneyins, declares (at the end of kandikā III) that the brāhmaṇas are to be dismissed at the end of the śrāddha with the verse 'Vāje vāje' (Vāj. S. 9.18) and the performer should circumambulate the brāhmanas with the mantra 'ā mā vājasya' (Vaj. S. 9. 19), it is not the practice among the sistas in Mithilā according to the editor of the Srāddharatna to observe these directions in what is called 'apătraka-pārvana-śrāddha' in these days. In Rudradhara's Srāddhaviveka (pp. 138-146) the apātraka pārvana-śrāddha-prayoga' is set out at length. 

In medieval and modern times in the different provinces of India different manuals are followed by the followers of the several Vedas. For example, in Bengal the Sāmavedins, Yajurvedins and Rgvedins follow the procedure of pārvana śrāddha laid down in the manuals (or paddhatis) of Bhavadeva, Pasupati and Kālesi respectively and there are many persons who follow the rules laid down by Raghunandana in his Śrāddhatattva and Yajurvediśrāddha-tattva In Mithilā, Śrīdatta wrote his Pitřbhakti for Yajurvedins and the Srāddha kalpa for Sāmavedins and the Srāddha-ratna of Mahāmaho pādhyāya Laksmīpati (between 1500 to 1640 A. D.) which is printed at Darbhanga and claims to be the traditional manual for Maithilas (Maithila-sāmpradāyika-śrāddhapaddhati) in several places says that it follows the Sugatisopāna of Prati hastaka for Chandogas and also for Vājasaneyins. In the Madras State Vaisnava brāhmaṇas follow special treatises on Pūrva and Apara kriyās of Vaidika-Sārvabhauma or Harita Venkatācārya or Tolappar and Smarta brāhmaņas follow the Smrtimuktāphala of Vaidyanātha, which does not much differ in major matters from the works of Vaidikasārvabhauma, Often the only differences are in the sankalpa and at the end. It is impossible to exhibit in this work the contents of all these manuals and to compare and contrast them. Therefore I shall set out here a model pārvanaśrāddha rite as performed by Revedios in Western India and then a Sukla Yajurveda rite, The Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha 93 rite for Rgvedins in

Śr. often taking passages verbatim from it, the smrtis and purāṇas). The performer wears white garments (lower and upper ) and sits on a seat of kuśas or of wool or deer skin and then sips water twice and wears a pavitra on the finger next to the small finger with Rg. IX. 83.1. He ties his top knot on the head and sacred thread with kušas, and ties three kuša blades with tilas on the left of the dhoti worn by him. Then he performs prāņāyāma and declares the resolve (sankalpa)1094 to perform (the Sāmvatsarika) śrāddha after referring to the time and place and together with agnaukarana, pindadāna &c. The invited brāhmanas reply 'do so'. Then the performer puts into a copper vessel water with the mantra imam me Gange' (Rg. X. 75.5), sandalwood paste with the mantra 'Gandhadvārām,' yava grains with the mantra 'thou art yava, king of cereals, Varuņa is thy patron, thou art endowed with sweetness, thou art the remover of all sing and art known by all sages as holy , betelnut (with Rg. X. 97,15), gold (or some coin) with the mantra 'Hiranya rūpah' (Rg. II. 35.10 ), flowers and basil leaves. (Then he becomes prācīnāvīti )1095 and puts sesamum grains in the water

Then after repeating the well-known verse 

apavitraḥ pavitro vā' 1097 (whoever, whether pure or impure or being in any state whatever, remembers the name of Viṣnu becomes pure externally as well as internally ), he requests 

May everything such as the place and the materials be rendered pure'. The brāhmaṇas reply 'let it be so.' Then placing some coin on the ground, the performer having in his hand sesamum grains, water and kūšas goes round (pradaksiņā) the brāhmaṇas thrice, and repeats three verses (in classical sanskrit) in praise of the dust of the feet of brāhmanas and a Vedic passage from Tai. Ā. II. 15 1098 "All the devatās reside in a brāhmaṇa who knows the Veda; therefore every day one should perform obeisance to brāhmanas knowing the Veda. He should not utter anything derogatory or evil (either true or false) about them. (By doing so) he pleases all these devatās. After making obeisance (to the brāhmaṇas) twice he should be prācīnāviti, repeat the verse ‘akrodhanaih' (note 013 p. 407 above) and request the brāhmaṇas 'may you be pleased to say that I have complete adhikūra to perform the sāmvatsarikaśrāddha of my pitrs this day. The brāhmaṇas should reply 'let there be this adhikāra for the performance of śrāddha.' Then being upavitin the performer requests ‘may you declare that this time is the proper time and that the food cooked is fit for being offered.' The brāhmaṇas reply 'let it be so.' Then he asks the permission to give invitation to the brahmanas. They give it. Then he touches the right knee of one brāhmana and says "you should find time to accept the invitation to act as representing the Viśve-devas named Purūrava and Ardrava in this pratisāmvatsarika šrāddha of my pitřs'. The brāhmaṇa replies 'yes, be it so.' Then the performer addresses the second Vaišvadevika brāhmana in the

He should request you should repair to my house. The brāhmaṇa replies 'I shall do so.' Then he should make mandalas 1099 for the daiva and pitrya brāhmaṇas. Then savyam. The performer should offer seat, sandalwood paste, flowers and say 'may all the items (upacāras) of showing honour be complete by means of yava grains.' Then apasavyam. He offers āsana (seat), sandalwood paste and flowers and declares 'may all the upacāras be completed by means of sesamum grains.' Then savyam. He offers welcome to the daiva brāhmaṇas, to which they respond by saying 

susvāgatam' (it is a good welcome). Then he should say * here is pādya for you, O Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ardrava! Bhūr-bhuvah-syah to the (daiva) brāhmana'; the response is 'supādyam'. He should wash the feet of (the daiva ) brāhmana or brāhmanas with the mantra 'san no devir' (Rg X. 9.4, vide n. 968). Then he wears the thread in the apasavya way and offers welcome to the pitrya brāhmaṇa or brāhmanas representing the three male ancestors 1100 and offers to give pādya to them and they respond with the words 'susvāgatam' and 'supādyam'. He also employs the verse 

san no devir' as in the case of daiva brāhmanas. 

Then the performer casts away the pavitra worn so far, washes his hands and feet, performs ācamana and wears two pavitras. Then savyam. He says welcome to all.' They respond with "susvāgatam'. Then holding the right hand (except the thumb) of the daiva brāhmaṇas he says "Ye gods, occupy seats '; they respond by saying 'susamāsmahe' (we have well occupied them). Then apasavyam.

shall perform the Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitrs that has been begun'. The brāhmaṇas say 'do so'. Then the verse 

sam no devir' (Rg. X. 9.4) is repeated and also the words thou art yava, separate from us those who hate us and who are our enemies'. Then apasavyam. The following texts are repeated viz. Rg. X. 9.4, Rg. X. 15.1 and with the mantra "The asuras, rākṣasas, the piśācas, that dwell along the earth are struck down; may they go from this place elsewhere wherever their mind may be fixed', he scatters sesamum grains everywhere and repeats the mantra, Rg. X, 87.1 There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras and twelve Adityas. Let there be protection given by Vispu at the door where śrāddha is being performed and may this spot be Gayā. The brāhmaṇas reply 'Let it be a good spot.' Then savyam. He sprinkles drops of water with darbhas over the food that is cooked for the śrāddha dinner with the mantras viz. Rg. IX. 58, 1, IX. 67.26-28 and with the three Vyāhrtis and the Gayatri. Then he requests 'May there be purity of the cooking' and 'nay the sprinkling of the cooked food be accord ing to the rules prescribed,' to which the response is ‘so be it.' Then the verse 'āgacchantu mahābhāgāḥ' (vide note 984) is recited and the brāhmaṇas reply 'we are careful (or atten tive).' Then apasavyam. He announces 'contemplating upon this spot where śrāddha is being performed as Gayā and con centrating the mind on Gadādhara (Vispu) and the pitrs in the form of Vasus and the like, the śrāddha (rite) proceeds'. The brāhmaṇas say 'do proceed.' Then savyam. He gives water on the hand of the daiva brāhmaṇas, places on the right side of the seat occupied by them two darbhas together with yavas with his upturned right hand held by the left hand and says with the Vyāhrtis (Bhür, bhuvah, svah) 'this is the seat for the brāhmaṇa representing the Viśve devas called Purürava and Ārdrava'. The brāhmana replies 'svāsanam'. This is done also for the second daiva brāhmaṇa. He then says 'Please sit down here, though art Dharma' and seizing the brāhmana's hand (ex cept the thumb) he says 'accept the invitation for being daiva brāhmana in the Pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha.' The response is 'so be it.' Then reaching the arghya water, he sprinkles the ground in front of the (daiva) brāhmaṇas with water, spreads two darbhas (in front of each daiva brāhmaṇa) with their tips towards the east, places down two vessels with theit tout turned downwards, sprinkles water over them with the dayatra mantra, raises the vessels up (i. e. turns their tops upwards), again sprinkles water over them and places over them (the two

Vessels) two kūrcas 1101 with the tips turned to the east, pours into them water and invokes the water once with the mantra, 'san no devir' ( Rg. X. 9. 4). Then he puts yava grains into the two arghya vessels for daiva brāhmanas with the mantra 'Yavosi dhānyarājo vā' (note 985 ) and also sandalwood paste, flowers, basil leaf and performs obeisance. He says "May all the upacaras be completed by means of yavas; the two arghya vessels for daiva brāhmanas are fully ready'. The response is 

susampanne'. He says 'svāhā, these are arghya waters'. The response is 'let there be arghya waters'. Placing his left hand in which he holds kuģas and yava grains on the right knee of the daiva brāhmana and holding in his (right) hand yava grains he says ‘Ishall invoke the Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ardrava to be present in you'. They respond' do invoke'. He invokes the Viśve-devas with the mantra viśve devāsa' (Rg. II. 47.13) separately repeated as regards each daiva brāhmaṇa. He says, 'I invoke the Viśve devas with the mantra 

visve devāh śrnutemām (Rg. VI. 52.13). Having invoked Vißve devas he casts the remaining yaya grains on the ground near the feet of the daiva brāhmaṇas. Then he gives water to them (daiva brāhmanas) and he puts in their hands the darbhas placed over the arghya vessels; he says 'O Viśve devas called Purūrava and Ārdrava! this is arghya water for you; svāhā, adoration. They respond let there be arghya'. Repeating the mantra 'yā divyā āpah' (vide āsv. Gr. IV.7.13 above in n. 966 ) he says 'this arghya has been offered, it is no longer mine.' They respond let it be so offered'. The same process is followed as to the second daiva brāhmana. Then he offers fragrant 1102 substances (sandalwood paste etc.), flowers, basil leaves, incense, lamp, and cash according to his ability as substitute for garment, gopicandana for unguent, sacred chord and two kuša blades for pavitra with the words 'O Viśve devāḥ, called Purūraya and Ardrava! these are fragrant substances for you according

to your portions; svāhā, adoration'. When offering a garment or cash therefor he recites 'yuvā suvāsāḥ' (Rg. III. 8.4). Then he says 'these items viz. gandha, leaves, flowers, incense, lamp ending with covering (garment) be all of them complete. Let there be good worship in the rite of worship; May that which is wanting or is excessive be according to prescribed rules'. The brāhmaṇas respond 'astu vidhivat' and the per former recites the verse 'I do obeisance to Acyuta by remem bering whom or by uttering whose name whatever is wanting in tapas (observances) or sacrifices becomes at once perfect'. 

Then he says to the pitrya brāhmaṇas with your permis sion I shall offer worship to the pitrs'. They reply 'do offer.' Then apasavyam. After bending his right knee, the performer says 'Bhūr bhuvah svah to Brahman, this is the seat for my father, grandfather and great-grandfather, named N, N., whose gotra is so and so and who are identical with Vasu, Rudra and Aditya'. So saying he offers double-folded darbhas with sesamum grains to the pitrya brāhmaṇas who reply 'svāsanam'. Then follows the same procedure as regards pitrya brāhmanas which has been already set out as to daiva brāhmaṇas. The only difference is that instead of two darbhas three darbhas are spread on the ground with their tips towards the south, three vessels are placed towards south-east with faces down wards and three double-folded darbhas are placed on each of the three vessels, instead of 'yavosi' the mantra is tilosi somadevatyaḥ' (vide note 966) and instead of 'svāhā namah the words "svadhā namaḥ' are employed, and instead of tulasi leaf bhrngarāja leaf is employed. In āvāhana the per former places his left hand holding kusas and sesame on the left knee of the pitrya brāhmana and the verse repeated is 'usantas tvā' (Rg. X. 16. 12) as to each pitrya brāhmaṇa and he should honour the pitrs by repeating one mantra 'ā yantu nah' (Vāj. S. 19. 58). He offers arghya 1103 water with the right hand supported by the left to the father and the other two paternal ancestors. Ho brings together the samsravas 1104 in the first pitrya vessel and anoints his face with that water if he desires a son. The brāhmaṇas respond 'may you have a son'.

He places the vessel containing samsravas with the top upside down on darbhas to the north of the daiva vessel, with the mantra thou art a place for the pitřs.' Then gandha, flowers with tulasi and bhrngarāja leaves, incense, lamp, garment or cash therefor, gopicandana, sacred chord, betelnut, kusas for pavitra are offered to the pitrs and he repeats the verse 'idam pit;bhyaḥ' (Rg. X. 15. 2). After repeating the verse ‘yat smrtyā' (vide above ) there is 'savyam'. The performer says 

with your permission I shall prepare mandalas and place the plates'. The response is 'do so'. On the spot where the plates for daiva brāhmaṇas are to be placed a four-cornered mandala beginning from the south-west to north-east and made with the right hand towards it and on the spot for the plates for pitrya brāhmaṇas the mandala is circular beginning from north-east to south-west made with the left hand towards it. Then the plates for the diners are to be placed inside those mandalas. Then taking holy ashes (apasavyam) he draws a line round the plates for pitrya brāhmaṇas with the mantra ‘piśanga-bhristim' (Rg. I. 133. 5). Then savyam. Then round the plates of the daiva brāhmaṇas he draws lines with the mantras 'raksā no' (Rg. IV. 3. 14 ) and 'brahma ca' (Rg. X. 4. 7) and two more verses ( probably Paurānic ) which pray that the mark made with ashes may guard all, just as Visnu protects the worlds. Just as Visnu renders ineffective the eyes of all men of evil sight, so one should make a mandala with ashes and when this is done there is no blemish in sitting in the same row for dining. Then the purification of the hand (right) of the brāhmaṇas is done, beginning with the pitrya brāhmaṇa first. Then the performer requests 'let me perform agnau karaṇa with your permission in the hand 1105 of the (pitrya ) brāhmaṇa.' The reply is 'do so'. Then apasavyam. Taking some cooked food and anointing it with clarified butter and dividing it into parts, having touched the two parts placed towards the south he says this for Soma accompanied by the Pitrs, this for Agni, the carrier of kavya' and having spread the left hand under neath the right hand, having cut off portions from the middle and the part to the east according to the rules for avadānas 1106

This is the mode every where. He touches water with the left hand and repeats the following (which is called 'samstha-japa' and occurs in ĀŠv. Śr. I. 11.15 ) 'Om ca me...te namaḥ'. Obeisance to Agni.

Then savyam.1109 Then naivedya is offered with the verse 'brahmārpanam' (Gitā 4. 24) and with three more verses in which Hari is said to be giver and the enjoyer and the food as having both natures viz, those of pitrs and devas and ultimately he winds up by saying 'tat sat brahmārpanamastu'. Then apasavyam. Then two verses are repeated in which adoration is offered to the feet of Siva, Visņu, Brahmā and other gods, in which even remembrance of Gayā-kṣetra is highly eulogised. Adoration to Kāśi Viśveśvara! adoration to Visņu and Gadādhara at Gayā! Then savyam. Then he says 'I shall repeat in your hearing the madhumati verses beginning with 'madhu vātā' (Rg. I. 90. 6-8). Then he repeats the word 'madhu' thrice. The brāhmanas respond sumadhu, all food is sweet.' Then apasavyam. Then a verse in praise of Viṣņu (eko Vispur &c.) 'there is one great Being viz. Visņu &c.' is recited and the performer says May Janārdana Visņu who has assumed the form of my father, grandfather and great-grandfather be pleased by this feeding of brāhmaṇas at the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitřs'. The response is ‘may he be so pleased'. Tat sat brahmārpanam-astu. Then having given water to the brāhmaṇas for apośana 1109a (then savyam) he says 'partake of (the food) at your pleasure' and 'though art the first layer of nectar'. Then he repeats the mantra 1110 fixing myself in faith and in Prāņa I offer nectar; being beneficent enter me without burning me. Svāhā to Prāna'. This is repeated as to Apāna, Vyāna, Udāna, Samāna with the substi tution of each of these four remaining life-breaths. Then he winds up my soul is in Brahma for the sake of immortality' and then 'svāhā to Brahma'. Then the hands are purified (by washing them with water). After muttering the Gāyatri verse ten times or three times, he repeats the hymn to Sraddhā (Rg.

You should take from the foods and vegetables that are cooked and are ready whatever pleases you and should discard what you do not like. You should eat at ease'. They respond 'we partake (of the food)'. He says 'I shall recite the hymns called Rāksoghna 1111 as far as I can.' They respond 'repeat'. Then towards the end of the dinner a little boiled rice with curds (should be served) and nectar-like Ganges water. He says 'everything is perfect. Ask for what ever you like out of the sacrificial food that is cooked'. They respond we have had enough'. He says "I shall recite the Madhumati verses (Rg. I. 90.6-8) in your hearing'. They respond 'recite them' Then apasavyam. He recites Rg. 1.82.2 1111a and should say 'The śrāddha called so and so is completed'. They "should respond 'susam pannam'. Then savyam. He asks 'Yo Viśvedevāḥl are you satisfied ?' They reply 'we are satisfied'. Then apasavyam. He asks 'Ye (brāhmaṇas) representing my father, grandfather and great-grandfather! are you satisfied ?'. They reply 'We are satisfied'. He asks 'what is to be done with the food that remains ?'. They reply 'it may be eaten in the company of your friends (and relatives)'. Then savyam. 

Then the performer declares that he would perform in the Prati-samvatsarika-śrāddha pinda pradāna (the offering of lumps of rice ) together with water and sesamum grains. They reply 'do so'. 'Let food be given to those who take as their share what remains outside the plates of the brahmana diners'.

Sprinkling the ground with water and strewing thereon darbhas cut with one stroke that have their tips turned to wards the south-east he says 1114 'May the Fathers wash them selves, may the grandfathers wash themselves, may the great grandfathers wash themselves'. In the same way he should sprinkle on the kusa grass water mixed with sesamum grains for the mothers and the rest. Then he says "This (food) is for thee, my father named so and so, of such and such gotra, who is (to be contemplated) as Vasu and for those who come here after thee; this is the pipda for thee 1115, svāhā! This pinda occupying the position of a pinda offered at Gayā is presented to my father named so and so and of such and such gotra and who is in the place of Vasu, it is (now ) not mine'. Similar formulas are repeated for the pinda offered to the grandfather (who is styled 'Rudrarūpa' instead of 'Vasurupa') and to the great-grandfather (who is styled 'Adityarūpa'). Then he utters 'Tat sat.' 'May whatever is offered in Gayā at the fourteen spots such as Visnupada be inexhaustible'. Then he wipes off on the roots of 1116 the darbhas on which the pindas are placed the particles (of rice, ghee and water ) sticking to his hand for the, gratification of those that are entitled to the wipings.

and having held his breathi according to his ability he should return to the original position and utter the words 'the Fathers regaled themselves and came like bulls, each to his share' and having smelt the remains of the boiled rice from which pindas are made from the left side (to the right ) he should cast the pindas (on the darbhas ) and should partake of the boiled rice by taking in as much steam and flavour out of it as he can by smelling it. He should say 'my father! N. N. by name, so and so by gotra, apply unctuous substance'; with these words he should anoint the pindas by means of darbhas with ghee or sesamum oil. And he should apply collyrium to the pindas with the words 'O father! N. N. by name and so and so by gotra apply collyrium'. He should put on the pindas unctuous subst ance, collyrium and garment, 1118 the last being the fringe of a garment or a tuft of wool with the words "O fathers ! this is the garment for you, do not take up any other (garment ) than this'. Then savyam. He then says "I shall offer worship to the pindas for the prosperity of my family'. He then offers to the pitrs present in the piņdas pādya, arghya, water for ācamana, bath, gandha, flowers, bhrngarāja leaf, incense, lamp and naivedya of apūpa (cakes) and pāyasa (rice cooked in milk), tāmbūla and dakṣiņā, using the word 'svadhā' after each of them.

Then savyam. On the ground near the plates of the Vaišva deva brāhmaṇas he scatters food together with yavas and water with the verse 'I shall offer food scattered (vikira) near the Vaiśvadeva brāhmaṇas to those gods to whom no soma drink is offered and who are bereft of a share in sacrifices; this scattered food is offered to Viśvedevas who do not partake of the soma drink; it is not (now) mine'. Then apasavyam. He says 'I shall offer food scattered near pitrya brāhmaṇas on the ground covered with darbhas to those who died without the saņskāras being performed for them and to those women of my family who left the family (for bad deeds); this scattered food is presented to those boys and girls that came out of the womb; it is not mine'. So saying he strews food with water and sesamum seeds and then says after reciting Rg. X. 15.14 'this pinda made from the remainder of the food and occupying the position that a pinda given at Gayā occupies, has been offered to those persons who were born in my family and died and who were cremated or were not cremated; this is not mine. So saying he offers near the pitrya brāhmaṇas a ball of rice and water mixed with sesamum grains, 

Then he washes his hands and feet, sips water twice and puts on his finger a pavitra with the mantra 'pavitravantah' (Rg. IX. 73. 3). He then requests that the water in the hands of the daiva brāhmaṇas be auspicious (or beneficial). The brāhmaṇas reply 'may the waters be auspicious.' In the same way there are requests for goodwill, for protection due to yavas, for long life, welfare, peace, prosperity, contentment and responses by the daiva brāhmaṇas giving blessings as to these. Then apasavyam. Then the same request for auspiciousness of waters, goodwill. protection by sesamum grains &c. and blessings about them by pitrya brāhmaṇas.

it be so.' Then raising the pranitā 1122a vessel the performer requests 'May you say that the water and food and the like offer ed in the Pratisāmvatsarikaśrāddha to pitr, pitāmaha and pra pitāmaha, so and so by name and gotra, be inexhaustible.' The pitrya brāhmanas reply 'so be it.' Then savyam. The same request is made to the daiva brāhmanas and the reply is the same. Then gold is given to the daiva brāhmaṇas and silver to pitrya brāhmaṇas and the performer says 'may the daksipās (fees) given to the brahmanas that ate the srāddha dinner protect (me).' They reply 'may they do so.' Then he says 'I shall request you to utter the word svadhā!' They reply 'do so.' Then apasavyam. Then he says "May (the brāhmaṇas representing) father, grand father and great-grandfather utter the word svadhā,' They reply let there be svadhā.' Then he should place over the pindas sesamum grains and water. Then he says ‘May you declare that svadhā be accomplished.' They reply 'may svadhā be accomplished.' Then savyam. Then he says 'may you say that the gods led by Agni be pleased.' They reply 'may the Viśvedevāḥ be pleased.' Then apasavyam. Then he requests ‘May you declare that the pitrs led by the Vasus be pleased'. They reply 'may the pitrs be pleased.' Savyam. He says 'May you declare that there is accomplishment of the sankalpa' (made at the beginning of the rite). They reply 

May there be accomplishment of the sankalpa'. He asks were the vegetables and cooked food liked by the pitrs'. They reply they were most excellent'. Then the performer decks himself by applying sandal paste to his forehead. After doing obeisance to the piņdas he requests for blessings for his family (which are the same as those set out above from the Padma purāṇa on p.452 above) and one more blessing 'May persons beg of us but may we not beg of any one' (vide n. 998). The brāhmaṇas reply in the same words only employing the words 'you' or 'your' for 'us' or 'our '. 

He says "I shall remove the pindas'. They reply do remove'. Then he repeats the verses Tad Vispoh' (Rg. I. 22.20 ), Tad viprāso' (Rg. I. 22.21 ) and two more verses and then a Paurānic verse enumerating the seven holy cities of Ayodhyā, Mathurā, Māyā, Kasi, Kāñci, Avantika and Dvārakā. He says "May there be peace, prosperity and contentment on the spot where the pindas are'. They reply these (peace &c.) dwell in their own places'. He says 'I shall

remove the plates in which the brāhmaṇas had their dinner.' Then he lays aside the kūrca. He then recites the verse 

Vāje vāje' (Rg. VII, 38,8). Then savyam. Then he says 'O pitrs, get up together with the devas' and repeats the verses 'ā mā vājasya' (Vāj. S. 9. 19), 'svādusansadah' (Rg. VI. 75. 9), "brāhmanāsah pitarah' (Rg. VI, 75. 10), 'ihaiva stam' (Rg. X. 85. 42). Then he recites 'may the grand fathers being pleased grant to men (their descendants ) long life, progeny, wealth, learning, heaven, mokṣa, happiness and kingdom' (Yāj. I. 270, but reads "prayacchantu' for 'prayac chanti'). Then he prays 'May these blessings turn out to be true, may my family prosper, may this Pratisāinvatsarika śrāddha have the same fruits as that of a śrāddha performed at Gayā! May the pitrs secure inexhaustible gratification.' Then he proceeds 'Today my birth has had its reward by bowing to your feet &c.' (vide n. 999 for the two verses repeated here ). The brāhmaṇas reply we forget the trouble and excuse you.' Then he says 'Today this tithi is like a day sacred to the sun; the brāhmanas invited are like Vyāsa, Vasistha and Vāmadeva; may you declare that whatever is lacking as regards seats, dinner, mantras, procedure, materials and fees in this prati sāmvatsarika śrāddha of my pitrs performed by me today be come all perfect at the words of brāhmaṇas'. They reply May all be perfect'. Then he recites the two verses "Vasist hāsaḥ pitřvad' and 'devān vasiṣtho' (Rg. X. 66. 14-15) and then at the end he repeats the verse containing a salutation (the word 'namah') viz. 'idam pitřbhyo namo astvadya' (Rg. X. 15. 2). Therefore at the end (of a śrāddha rite) one does obeisance to the pitrs (in the words 'namo vaḥ pitaro &c.'). Therefore they say “should one repeat the pitryā verses with āhāva mantra specially recited with each verse or without repeating the āhāva mantra separately with each verse; for it is better not to finish Pitryajña quickly. He who separately recites the āhāva with each verse makes the pitryajña that is imperfect, complete and therefore one must recite specially employing the āhāva with each verse."1123 The conclusion is 

1123. The words in the rim (p. 108a ) are 'e T TT FÅ staara नमस्कारवतीमन्ततः शंसति तस्मादन्ततः पितृभ्यो नमस्क्रियते । तदाहुाहावं पिया शंसेश्त् अव्याहावा ३ इति । व्याहावमेव शंसेदसंस्थितं वै पितृयज्ञस्य साध्वसंस्थितं वा एष पितृयज्ञ संस्था quia T ET Siha ata ZETTā ṣikay '. The passage m it नमो... up to शंस्तव्यम् is taken verbatim from the ऐतरेयब्राह्मण 13thushapter 13th khanda (end). The khanda (13) starts with the question whether the

one should repeat each verse with āhāva separately uttered. The performer should follow the brāhmanas up to the boundary of the village). He says 'whatever blemish there may be in japa, tapas or śrāddha rite--may all that become free from blemish by the favour of brāhmaṇas. I do adora tion to that Acyuta (Visnu) by remembering whom &c. O best of brāhmaṇas! may this śrāddha, even if devoid of mantras, or of some rite or of faith, become perfect by your favour'. Then he concludes "May Janārdana Vasudeva who assumes the forms of father, grand-father and great-grand father be pleased by this sacrifice, viz. the pratisāmvatsarika śrāddha of the pitrs. This is a sacrifice to the manes. Tat sat. May it be dedicated to Brahma.' Then he repeats the verse * Vaṣat te' (Rg. VII. 99.7) and then says 'adoration to Viṣnu (Viṣņave namah) thrice and sips water twice. The fruit of offering piņdas is stated by Bphaspati and Vrddha-Parāśara as follows: If the pitrs are in the world of gods they are grati fied by the food offered in fire, if they are in the world of pitrs they are gratified by the dinner to brāhmaṇas and if in hell they are gratified by the balls offered on the ground, 1123a 

Comparing the above rather elaborate and exhaustive procedure with the procedure of pratisāmvatsarikaśrāddha as 

(Continued from the last page) verse 'devānām patnir' (Rg. V. 46. 6) or the rk verse referring to Rākā should be recited first in the surfar asta in gai hia. The conclusion reached is that the verse referring to aagcars should be recited first by the EIA. In the same context a question is raised whether the Yāmī verse (Rg. X, 14,4 'Imam yama prastaram') or the Pitryā verses (Rg. X. 15.1-3) should be recited first. The conclusion is that the rat verse should be first recited, then the Kavya verse (Rg. X. 14. 3 'Matali kavyair') and then the pitrya verses, out of which Rg. X. 15.2 (Eg fûqxu 31a) is recited last in which the word नमः occurs. आहाव means the mantra शोसावोम, The figure 3 is a sign of the wa accent. The sign of wa shows deliberation, TE:-we have to understand garga: as the subject. Then comes the question whether the stera should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitryā verses or not. The conclusion is that the 3TER should be recited at the beginning of each of the three pitryā verses. Apparently it is rather difficult to say why this passage of the datater should occur in this TUTT. The only reason appears to be that the . a. passage has something to say about fags and hence as this is a ty for fuas it ts introduced here:

practised in Madras in these days only a few points of diffe rences in detail emerge. In the Madras procedure the numer ous mantras as set out above (p. 448) do not occur nor does the Tai. Ā, passage occur therein, but the verses in praise of the dust of brāhmana's feet do occur. Most of the mantras both Vedic and Pauranic are the same. The blessings (asir vādas) in the Madras manual are more elaborate and include even the performer's cattle in the blessing of health and long life. In the Madras manual several mantras are set out as 'annasākta' mantras in the procedure itself. The Madras paddhati adds at the end the well known verse 'kāyena vācā 

manasendriyairva'. 

The procedure for Yajurvedins of the Mādhyandina Sakha in Bengal as set out by Raghunandana in his Yajurvedi-śrā ddhatattva is entirely based on the 2nd and 3rd kandikās of the Srāddha-sūtra of Katyāyana. The Pāryanaśrāddha-prayoga in Halāyudha's Brāhmanasarvasva closely follows Kātyāyana and I am assured by a careful student of Dharmaśāstra that the pro cedure of pārvanaśrāddha followed by Madhyandinas at Bhat para in Western Bengal is in strict conformity with the proce dure laid down by Raghunandana. The Śrāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana is translated here with some explanations and additions made by Halāyudha and Raghunandana and the whole text, being not very extensive, is given in the note below1124.

"The pārvaņa-śrāddha is preceded by the rite for Višve devas. The procedure follows that of Pindapitryajña 1124a. In the rites for the pitrs double-folded darbhas are to be used (while in Vaišvadevika rite straight darbhas are used). Whenever any thing is to be gifted, the performer (in all daiva as well as pitrya rites ) wears a pavitra and makes the gift sitting. (When questions are to be asked the performer puts the question to the most eminent in the row of diners (to the best daiva brāhmana in daiva rites and to the best pitrya brāhmaṇa in pitrya rites) or he may put the question to all (and the reply is given by one or by all). Spreading darbhas on the seats (he makes the brahmanas occupy them), he puts the question 'shal] I invoke the Visvedevas (to the daiva brāhmana)'. Being permitted (by the daiva brahmanas) in the words 'do invoke', he invokes the Visvedevas with the mantra 1125 Visve devāsa āgata' (Vāj. S. 7. 34 'Ye All Gods, come, listen to this my call and sit down on this darbha grass '). Then he scatters yavas (in front of the brāhmaṇas), mutters a mantra Viśvedevāḥ srunutemam' (Vaj. S. 33. 53, 'Ye All Gods, hear this call of mine'). After this japa he asks (the pitrya brāhmaṇas) 'I shall invoke the pitrs'. When permitted (by the pitrya brah manas) in the words do invoke', he invokes them with the mantra 'usantas tva.' (Vaj. S. 19, 70, 'O Agni! we longing for our fathers place you down' &c.). Then he scatters (sesamum

Then he pours water in each of the cups made of a sacrificial tree (such as palāša, udumbara &c.), in which a pavitra is dipped with the mantra 'san no devir' (Vāj. S. 36. 12, 'May the divine waters be for our happi ness' &c.). (He puts yavas in the vessel for daiva rite). He puts in each of the cups sesamum grains with the mantra 'Thou art Tila 1126 &c.'. He offers on the hands of each of the brāhmaṇas (first daiva and then pitrya) that wear a pavitra water in a vessel made of gold, silver, copper, rhinoceros horn or precious stone or in whatever vessels may be available or in vessels made of bunches of leaves with the mantra 'yā divyā 1127 āpah &c.'. The water is offered in the words 'O father' N. N. by name, this is arghya for you' (and then to other ancestors ).

Then (at this stage) gandha 1129 (sandalwood paste), flowers, incense, lamp and garment are offered to the brāhmaṇas repre senting the ancestors).

(notes 992, 1108a). (He keeps some food aside for making piņdas later on). Then (having served the food in the plates ) he plunges the thumb of the brāhmapas in the food with a řk (Rg. I. 22. 17, ‘idam Visnur vicakrame') addressed to Viṣnu or with a Yajus so addressed (Visno kavyamidam raksasva'). Then he scat ters about (yavas before daiva brāhmaṇas silently and) sesa mum grains with the mantra 'apahatā asurā raksānsi vedi ṣadaḥ' (Vāj. S. 2. 29). Then he should serve hot food very much liked (by diners or by the departed) or he may serve such food as he can afford. While the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating (the dinner) he should perform japa of the follow ing 1131, viz, the sacred Gāyatri once or thrice preceded by om and the vyāhrtis, the verses called Rāksoghni (note 1111 ), mantras addressed to the pitřs (Rg.

Then finding that the brāh maņas are satiated with food, he should scatter some food in front of the dining brāhmanas, he should give to each brāh mana water once (for aposana at the end of dinner). Then he should mutter as before the Gāyatri, the (three) Madhumati verses (Rg. I. 90. 6-8) and the word 'madhu' (thrice). Then he asks are you satiated'. Being permitted by them in the words 'we are satiated', he makes them give their consent as to the rest of the food, collects together all food in one vessel (in order to make piņdas from it); he offers (two sets of three pindas, three for paternal ancestors and three for maternal ancestors) on darbhas near the spot where 1132 the brāhmaṇas dined and left uneaten food in plates and pours water over the pindas for ablution 1133.

Then he prays for the following blessings. He prays 'may the pitrs be not terrible (i. e. be kind) to us'. The brāhmaṇas reply ‘may they be so'. He prays 'May our family prosper'. They reply "may it be so'. He prays 'May donors increase in our family'. They reply 'let it be so'. He prays 'May Vedas and our pro geny prosper'. The reply is 'May they do so'. He says 'May faith not depart from me'; they say "May it not depart'. He says 'May we possess many things that we can donate'. They reply 'so be it'. After receiving these blessings he spreads kušas called svadhāvācaniya 1134a together with pavitras (on the ground near the piņdas or, on the piņdas themselves according to Devayājñika and others); he asks (all the brāh manas or the most eminent one) 'shall I request you to utter the word svadhā'. Being permitted by them in the words 'May svadhā be recited' he prays "May there be svadhū to the pitrs, to the grandfathers, to the great-grand-fathers, to the maternal grandfather, maternal great-grandfather and maternal great great-grandfather'. When the brāhmanas reply "May there be svadhā' he sprinkles water over the svadhāvācaniya darbhas with the mantra 'ūrjam vahantir' (Vāj. S. II. 34). Then he turns the vessel top upwards (which had been placed with top downwards) and he should give to the brāhmaṇas dakṣiņā according to his ability. He should make the daiva brāhmanas repeat 'May all the gods be pleased'. He should then dismiss the brāhmaṇas with the mantra "Vāja vāje' (Vāj. S. 9. 18), he should follow the brāhmanas (up to the village boundary ) with the mantra 'ā mā vājasya' (Vāj. S. 9. 19), circumambulate them and then enter his own house.

Pārvanaśrāddha in Bengal 

509 

It is to be noted that in the Bengal Manual of Pārvana śrāddha based on the Brāhmanasarvasva of Halāyudha and also on Raghunandana's Yajurvedi-śrāddhatattva the following details are added after the pindas are placed on the darbhas and before the dismissal of the brāhmaṇas. He turns towards the north and says 'O pitrs, regale yourselves here and come like bulls each to his portion.' Then he turns round to his former position and says 'the pitrs regaled themselves and came like bulls each to his own share.' Then he loosens 1135 the side of his dhoti which has been tucked up and then folds up his hands (i. e. offers six namaskāras) with the mantra 1136 'Namo vaḥ pitaro rasāya' (Vāj. S. I. 32). He smells 1137 the pindas and gives the middle one to his wife, if she desires a son, with the mantra ''ādhatta' (Vaj. S. II. 33). 

From considerations of space the procedure of pārvaņa śrāddha among Hiranyakeśins in modern times is passed over here. Moreover, it closely resembles the procedure in Āśv. Gr. set out above, the principal difference being that some of the mantras are different. The Samskāraratnamālā of Gopinātha deals with this from p. 985 onwards. But one noticeable feature of this last work is that of making hair-splitting distinctions. On p. 985 it refers to two śrāddhas (other than pinda-pitr yajña) to be performed on amāvāsyā, viz. māsi-śrūddha and māsika-śrāddha, the first being described by the Dharmasutra of Hiranyakesin and the second by the Gshyasūtra. Gopinātha further says that māsikaśraddha is the model of the other śrāddhas described in the Grhyasūtra and māsisraddha is the model of śrāddhas described in the Dharmaśāstras, such as Mahālayaśrāddha or Samvatsarika-śrāddha, that Darśaśrāddha itself is māsi-śrāddha (p. 988) and that māsika-śrāddha may be performed on each darśa or on any one darśa day in a year and that māsi-śrāddha follows immediately after Pindapitryajña as

laid down by Manu (III. 122) and māsikaśrāddha may be per formed after māsi-śrāddha. In modern times no one performs māsiśrāddha or māsika-śrāddha strictly in accordance with the ancient rules. Srāddha is supposed to be performed by feeding a brāhmaṇa and giving him a dakṣiņā of a few annas. The Srāddhatattva (Jiv., part 1 p. 254) provides, after quoting Matsya and Bhavisya, that, if a person is unable to perform a pārvanaśrāddha every month, he should perform one at least thrice a year when the sun is in the zodiacal signs of Kanyā, Kumbha and Vrsabha and that if he is unable to perform even thrice then he should perform at least once when the sun is in the sign of Kanyā. 

The two meanings of sapiņda given by the Mit, and the Dāyabhāga have already been explained at great length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and pp. 472-477. The Dāyabhāga pro pounded the theory that whoever conferred greater spiritual benefit on the deceased by the performance of śrāddhas and the offering of pindas was entitled to be preferred as an heir to the deceased's wealth. The Mit. said that heirship depended on blood relationship and the nearest in blood to the deceased was the preferential heir. But even under the Mit. whoever took the wealth of the deceased was bound to pay his debts (Yaj. II, 51 ) and to offer śrāddha and pinda to him. This subject and the several propositions deduced from the texts have been dealt with in H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 734-745. 

One thing to be remembered is that in determining the preferential right regard is to be had to the capacity of a per son and the efficacy of the pindas when offered. After a person takes the wealth of the deceased, there is no legal machinery to enforce his duty to offer pindas 1138 It was argued in Nalinaksha v. Rajani Kanto 35 C. W. N. 726 that, if an heir does not offer pindas or refuses to offer them to his ancestor. he was not entitled under Hindu Law to succeed to him. This argument was repelled by the judges with the remark that there was no authority for such a proposition and that the right to inheritance is based under the Dāyabhāga not on offering pinda but on the capacity to offer it (p. 729). Vide Gooroo Gobinda Saha v. Anand Lal 5 Beng. L. R. 15 (F. B.) and Digambers Motilal 9 Cal. 563 (F. B.) for the statement that the principle of spiritual benefit is the sole foundation of the theory of in.nl

heritance propounded in the Dāyabhāga. But in certain later cases such as Akshayachandra v. Hari Das 35 Cal, 721 it was rightly pointed out that spiritual benefit is not always the guiding principle under the Bengal school of law, that the principle of spiritual efficacy as the guiding principle fails in all classes of female relations such as the wife, the daughter and the mother whose rights are really based on special texts and that the reason for inheritance by a re-united coparcener was not spiritual benefit but was based on a quasi contract and affection 

The question about how śrāddha was to be performed if one or more of the three paternal ancestors were alive engaged the thoughts of writers from very ancient times. The Āśv. 1139 Śr. S. (II. 6. 16-23) first sets out the views of Gāņagāri, Taulvali and Gautama and then refutes them. Gā pagāri held that out of the three paternal ancestors pindas should be offered to those that were dead and those that were alive should be honoured in person, since the śrāddha rite is meant for pleasing the ancestors; Tau)vali opined that pindas should be offered to all the three ancestors, whether living or dead, since in the rite of śrāddha they are only a secondary matter (a detail). Gautama thought that pindas should be offered to dead ancestors, upto three from the father if the latter was living, from the grand father if he was alive and from the great-grandfather if all the three be living. Āśv. replies; one cannot offer pindas to three ancestors 1110 beyond the father, grand-father or great grandfather, since one has no adhikāra to do so; one cannot offer pindas to an ancestor after whom there is an ancestor (within three degrees) living. One may offer homa into fire to those that are alive. (If all three ancestors are alive ) all the three pindas must be cast into fire or he may not begin the rite at all. The Katyāyana śr. 1141 sūtra provides

1140. One can offer pindas only to three ancestors beginning with the father according to Vedic passages quoted in notes 958, 960a above, and Manu IX. 186. So there is no ancient authority to offer pinda to Ath or Sth or 6th ascendant.

that pindas are offered only to deceased ancestors; therefore if a person's father be alive or if there is a deceased ancestor between whom and the performer there is an ancestor that is alive, then one whose father is alive can only perform homa (into fire, but no pindadāna) or he should not undertake at all (the rite of pinda-pitryajña or pārvanaśrāddha); that Jātākarnya prescribes that no pindadāna is possible when a living ancestor (father) intervenes between the performer and a deceased ancestor, since a śruti text says 'one does not offer pindas to ancestors that are beyond a living ancestor.' Manu (III. 220-222 ) deals with this question as follows: If the performer's father be alive he should offer pindas to three ancestors begin ning from the paternal grand-father or he may request the father to dinner as he would do to a stranger brāhmaṇa and offer pindas to the deceased grand-father and great-grand-father, If the father be dead and the grandfather be alive, he may offer a pinda only to the father and the great-grandfather (i. e. only two pindas) or the grand-father who is alive may be invited to dinner as if he were the stranger brāhmana invited to represent a deceased grand-father or if permitted by the grandfather who is alive he may offer pindas to father, great-grandfather and great great-grandfather. The Visnudharmasūtra (chap. 75) has several rules of a similar character. Some of the Purānas such as Skanda VI 225.24-25, Agni 117,58-59 deal with this matter. Gobhilasmrti (II. 93 ff) has a long passage on this question, one verse of which is quoted below. 1142 Many of the commentaries and digests hold divergent views on this subject, viz. the Mit. on Yāj. I. 254, Kalpataru (śr. pp. 240 ff), Śr. K. K. pp. 552-556 and Nirnayasindhu (III, pp. 499-503 ). It is impossible to reconcile all the views. The Kalpataru (on śr. p. 240) states that there are three alternative courses for him whose father is alive; (1) he should pass over the father that is alive and offer pindas to those three ancestors to whom his father offers pindas: (Manu. III, 220, Visņu Dh. S. 75.1); (2) he should simply offer homa into fire as stated in Aśv. Sr. S. quoted above: (3) he should not engage in the rite of pindapitryajña or pārvanaśrāddha at all (Gobhila-smrti II. 93). The Nirnaya sindhu says that there are numerous alternatives mentioned by different writers, that they are forbidden in the Kali age and com

that one view is that a man whose father is alive cannot engage in a pārvanaśrāddha and that the real conclusion is that śrāddha may be offered to those to whom the father of the performer ) who is living offers pindas. It is clear that one whose father is living should have nothing to do with pindadāna for deceased ancestors. Manu (in latter half of III. 220) allowed an alternative viz. one should feed one's father at a dinner (and honour him with the details of worship such as gandha, dhūpa, dipa) and offer pindas to the deceased grandfather and great-grandfather. When any one or two out of the three paternal ancestors are alive and śrāddha is permitted to a descendant several alternatives become possible by permu tation and combination, which are passed over here from considerations of space and utility. But the various views held by different writers as described above show clearly what a firm grip the theory of the supreme benefits to be derived from śrāddhas had on the minds not only of common people but of learned men, who, in spite of the fact that the father was alive and was there to offer pindas to his three ancestors, allowed even the son (whose father was living) to offer pindas to the same three ancestors. The Viṣņu Dh. S. extends the procedure about 'jivatpitrka' to one's mother's paternal ancestors ( changing the mantra where necessary ). 1142a Similar rules apply where the performer's mother is alive (Agnipurāṇa 117.60'evam mātrādikasyāpi tathā mātāmahādike'). 

It is provided by Gobhilasmrti (III. 157) that a śruti injunc tion should be made effective by means of anukalpa (of some substituted procedure) if the primary procedure cannot be carried out.1143 If a person cannot secure several brāhmaṇas but can secure only one, he should perform Pārvana-śrāddha in which six pindas are to be offered with a single brāhmaṇa, pro vided he is pankti-pāvana 1144 (sanctifier of a row of diners) and in such a case, naivedya should be offered in place of the dinner

to the daiva brāhmaṇas and the food should be thrown into fire; so says Sankha 14.10. If even a single brāhmana cannot be had for a pārvanaśrāddha, then one should prepare with kušas the effigy of brahmana students (batu) and the performer should himself ask the questions and give the answers required in pārvanasraddha.1145 

When one cannot secure a brāhmana nor materials, or when one is on a journey, or on the birth of a son, or when one's wife is in her monthly illness, one may perform āmaśrāddha (Sraddha with uncooked grains). 1146 This is stated by the Skandapurana VII.1.206.52. Katyayana and Saurapurana. 19.32 have similar verses "a twice-born person should perform āmašrāddha when he is on a journey or is in distress, or if he has no fire for cooking and those who are weak may always perform it.' The Madanapārijāta (p. 483) states that one who has the adhikāra for pārvanaśrāddha can alone offer āmasrāddha. Hārīta says that when there is an obstacle in performing a śrāddha, āmasrāddha is prescribed except in the case of māsika and sāmvatsarika śrāddhas, 1147 Amaśrāddha is always pres cribed for sūdras. It was further provided that the grains offered in srāddha should be utilized by the brāhmaṇas for eating the cooked food for themselves and were to be applied for no other purpose (Hemādri, Śr. p. 1527). Vyāsa provides 1148 that the quantity of grains should be at least two or three or four times as much as the grains required for offering cooked food.

Amasraddha is to be performed in the first part of the day, ekoddista in the noon, the pārvanaśrāddha in the afternoon and yrddhišrāddha in the first part of the day (divided into five ). 1149a 

If even uncooked food grains cannot be offered the per formier should perform hemaśrāddha (śrāddha with money ). When the sun passes from one sign of the zodiac into another, in default of food and brāhmaṇas, on a journey, on the birth of a son, in an eclipse, in the case of women and südras hema śrāddha is allowed or when one's wife is in her monthly illness. In āmaśrāddha twice the quantity of grains required in offering cooked food and in hemaśrāddha four times (the price of the grains required for cooked food) has to be offered. If no money can be had the digests prescribe several modes which have already been set out above ( vide p. 425, n. 955).

CHAPTER X 

EKODDISTA AND OTHER SRĀDDHAS 

Having dealt at great length with Pārvanaśrāddha which is the model of all śrāddhas it is now time to speak of Ekoddista śrāddha that is a modification of Pārvanaśrāddha 1150 The word Ekoddista means 'that in which only one deceased person 1151 is intended (to be invoked or benefited)'. The Pārvana śrāddha is intended for three paternal ancestors and is thus distinguished from Ekoddista. In šān. gr. IV. 2, Baud. gr. III, 12.6, the Srāddhasūtra of Katyāyana (kandikā 4), and Yāj. I. 251-252, the points of difference between the two are clearly set out.1152 In this srāddha only one arghya is offered, there is only one pavitra and only one pinda is offered, there is no āvāhana (as there is in Pārvana), no agnau karana, there are no brāhmaṇas invited to represent the Visve-devas; the question about being satiated by the dinner is to be asked in the word 'svaditam (did it taste well) and the brāhmanas reply with 'susvaditam') (it had excellent taste ); instead of saying 'may it be in exhaustible,' the formula here used is ‘May it approach' (or wait upon the deceased person); when the brāhmanas are sent away at the end of the dinner the word used is 'be satisfied (or delighted)' and they reply we are delighted.' The Viṣnu purāņa (1II. 13. 23-26) and Mārkandeya (28. 8-11) closely follow the Śrāddhasūtra and Yāj. According to śān. gr. (IV. 2. 7),1153

Characteristics of Ekoddista 

517 

Manu III, 257, Mārkandeya (28. 11), Yāj. I. 256 and others, for one year after the death of a twice-born person till the sapiņdikarana śrāddha is performed this is the way in which śrāddha is to be performed for the preta every month. The Visnudharmasūtra 21.2 provides that suitable changes (üha) should be made in the mantras employed (e. g. instead of 'atra pitaro mādayadhvam' the mantra should be ‘atra pitarmādayas va' (O father! 1154 regale thyself here). In Ekoddista such a formula as 'ye ca tvām-anu' (those that come after thee) can not be employed and the word 'pitr' is not to be employed (till sapindikarana is performed), but the word 'preta' (Aparārka p. 525 quoting Saunaka-grhyaparisista).1155 

As seen above (p. 262, note 591a) Ekoddista śrāddhas are of three kinds, nava, navamiśra and purāņa. Navašrāddhas are those that are performed till the 10th or 11th day after death, navamiśras (or misras) are those that are performed after the 11th day till one year (or six months, according to some) after death. Aparārka quotes a verse from Vyāghra 1156 that Ekoddista-śrāddha is performed on the 11th day, on the 4th day, at the end of each month for a year after death and every year on the day of death and a verse of Katyāyana that (ekoddista) śrāddha should be performed for one who had kept sacred fires on the 11th day after the day of cremation and that the Dhruva śrāddhas should always be performed on the day of death. Aparārka explains 'Dhruvāni' as meaning those that are performed after three fortnights from death. About the navasrāddha there is again a divergence of views. One meaning has already been given above on p. 262 note 593. The Skandapurāņa VI (Nāgarakhanda ) 205. 1-4 and Garudapurāņa (pretakhanda 5. 67-69 ) state that navašrāddhas are nine viz. the three performed where a man died, where the funeral pro cession rested on the way and where the burnt bones were collected and six more performed on the 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, and 11th days after death.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

Numerous works lay down that there are sixteen śrāddhas which must be performed for a deceased person and that if these are not performed then his spirit is not freed from the condition of being a preta and a pisaca.1157 There is a great deal of diver gence of views about what these sixteen śrāddhas are, some works including sapindikarana among the 16, others excluding it therefrom. Gobhilasmrti III, 67 enumerates 1158 the 16 as follows: The twelve monthly śrāddhas (performed every month on the tithi of death), the first (i. e. the sraddha on the 11th day), two śrāddhas on (a day prior to the expiry of) every six months from the tithi of death and sapiņdikaranà are the sixteen Sraddhas. The Garudapurana 1159 refers to three groups of sixteen, one of which enumerates the 16 sraddhas as those performed on the 12th day (after death), after three fort nights, after six months, after every month and at the end of the year, while the Padmapurāņa 1160 enumerates them as follows: the sixteen śrāddhas are those performed on the 4th day after death, at the end of three fortnights, after six months, after a year and twelve srāddhas performed each month (on the tithi of death). The Kalpataru p. 25 and Brahmapurāṇa q. by Aparārka (p. 523) state that the 16 śrāddhas are those performed on 4th, 5th, 9th and 11th days after death and the twelve monthly śrāddhas (on the tithi of death 1161).

Views on sixteen śrāddhas 

519 

others say that after performing the 16 śrāddhas according to the procedure for Ekoddista śrāddhas sapindana should be performed. 1162 The Madanapārijāta (p. 615 ), the Nirnaya sindhu (III. p. 599) and others say that in this conflict of views one should follow the usage of one's country, Vedic Sākhā or family. There were two views about the śrāddha on the 11th day. It should be remembered that Yāj. III. 22 laid down impurity on death for 10, 12, 15 and 30 days respectively for the four varņas. One view espoused by Sankha and Paithi nasi was that in spite of the days of impurity not being over śrāddha must be performed on the 11th day (and for the moment the performer becomes pure for that purpose). The other view was that of the Matsyapurāṇa and Viṣnudharmasūtra 21.1 that the first śrāddha (ekoddista ) was to be performed on the expiry of āśauca. 

In the case of ascetics dying it is provided by Uśanas 1163 that by the fact of their taking to the order of sannyāsa (of the ekadandi kind in the Kaliyuga ) they have not to undergo the condition of being preta, no Ekoddista nor Sapiņdikarana should be performed for them by their son or other relative but only pārvanaśrāddha on the 11th day and every year thereafter. Śatātapa provides 1164 that no Ekoddista, no water, no pinda and no cremation rites should be offered to an ascetic nor mourning should be observed, but pārvana-śrāddha should be performed. Pracetas quoted by Mit on Yāj. I. 256 states that no ekoddista is to be performed for an ascetic nor sapiņdi karaṇa, but only pārvana on the day of death every year in Bhadrapada dark half. The Sivapurana (Kailāsa-samhitā) chapters 22 and 23 deal with the rites to be performed on an ascetic's death on the 11th and 12th days. 

In the Navaśrāddhas no incense, no lamps are employed. All mantras having the words 'pitr' and 'svadhā namah' are

omitted and so is the word 'anu' omitted and there is no japa and no recital of mantras in the hearing of the brāhmaṇas. As stated in the Brahmapurāņa, the śrāddhas performed in the house at the end of impurity on the 12th day, at the end of a month etc, are called ekoddista. It follows that the rites called navaśrāddhas offered during the days of impurity are per formed at the place of death or in the cemetery or at a place where water and piņda are offered (and not in the house ); vide Sm. C. (āśauca p. 176 ). In the navamióra śrāddha mantras are employed according to some. In former times and now also all the 16 śrāddhas are performed on the 11th day. Hardly any one waits for one year to perform Sapindikarana. In former times it was laid down (e. g. by the Mit. ) that in times of difficulty, Sapindikarana should be performed even before a year elapses after performing the sixteen śrāddhas. But now this exception has become the rule. 

Sapindikarana or Sapindana is the reception of a deceased person into the community of pitrs to whom pindas are offered. Several times were prescribed by ancient works for this. Acc. to the Kausītaki gr. IV. 2 this śrāddha could be performed after the death of the deceased at the end of a year or at the end of three fortnights or on the happening of a lucky event (like the birth of a son or a marriage). The Bhāradvāja1165 gr. (III. 17) allowed it at the end of a year (after death) or in the 11th or 6th or 4th month or on the 12th day. The Baud, Pitsmedhasūtra II. 12.1 mentions five times for sapindikarana viz, one year, 11th, 6th or 4th month or 12th day. The Garudapurāņa (Pretakhanda 6. 53-54) states the time of Sapiņdikarana to be one year, six months, three fortnights, the 12th day or on a lucky occasion. The Viṣnupurāņa (III. 13. 26ff) makes similar provisions about sapindikarana (which is an ekoddista śrāddha). Aparārka (p. 540) after a long discussion holds that there are three times for a performer who is an āhitāgni viz. 12th day, some day between the end of āśauca and the first amāvāsya (after death) or the first amāvāsyā after āśauca ends and prescribes four times for one who has not kept sacred fires, viz. a year, six months, three fortnights or when a lucky event occurs. The Madanapārijāta quotes a verse of Vyāsa that the 12th day is

commended (for the sapiņdana śrāddha) because family usages are innumerable, because man's life is short and because the body is evanescent. The Viṣņu Dh. S. (21.20) provides that for sūdras 12th day after death is the only day for Sapiņdi karana (but without Vedic mantras). Gobhila laid down that after Sapiņdikarana was performed, there was to be no per formance of śrāddhas every month, but Gautama (or Saunaka, according to Aparārka p. 543) held the view that they may be performed according to the procedure of ekoddista śrāddhas. Bhattoji says 1166 that when sapiņdikarana is performed before the end of the year, then all the sixteen śrāddhas must be per formed before Sapindikarana, yet the monthly śrāddhas should again be performed at their proper times for one year. Yāj. I. 255 and Viṣnu Dh. S. 21. 23 prescribe that even if Sapiņdi karana is performed for a deceased person within less than a year from death still for one year food and a jar of water should be given to a brāhmaṇa for the whole year (for the benefit of the deceased). Usanas provides that even if the heirs of a deceased person are divided in wealth, still the nava śrāddhas, the sixteen śrāddhas, and sapiņdikaraṇa must be performed by one alone 1167 (e. g. the eldest son), but Pracetas provides that when a year has ( elapsed ) śrāddha may be performed separately by each heir 1168 

The procedure of Sapindana or Sapiņdikarana is des cribed in numerous works such as the Sān. gr. V. 9, Kausi taki gr. IV. 2, Baud, Pitrmedhasūtra III, 12.12, Srāddha-sūtra of Kātyāyana (kandikā 5), Yāj. I. 253-254, Viṣņupurāņa III. 13.27 ff., Vispu Dh.

Pitrmedhasūtra III, 12.12, in this grāddha there is invitation to the brāhmaṇas the previous day, there is agnaukarana, there is the recital of Vedic texts when the brāhmaṇas are engaged in eating, Vaišvadeva brāhmaṇas are honoured, the Viśvedevas are Kāma and Kāla (vide n. 1018), there is the presentation of incense and lamp, there is svadhā and also namaskāra. Four vessels for arghya should be got ready and filled with sandal wood paste, water and sesamum grains, one being for the deceased (the preta) and three for his paternal ancestors; two daiva brāhmaṇas should be invited, one to represent the preta and three to represent the three paternal ancestors of the preta; if a man is unable to invite so many brāhmaṇas, he should invite three, one for Visvedevas, one for the preta and one for the three paternal ancestors. He should request 'I shall unite the vessel for the preta with the vessels for his three paternal ancestors.' When permitted in the words 'do unite', he should cast the kušas in the vessel for the preta into the vessels for his three paternal ancestors, should keep a little water mixed with kusas in the vessel for the preta and distribute the rest of the water from the preta vessel into the three vessels for his ancestors with the two mantras 11994 'ye samānā' (Vāj. S. 19. 45-46). Arghya is offered to the brāhmaṇa representing the preta with the water that remains in the preta vessel, arghya is offered to the three pitrya brāhmaṇas from the three pitrya vessels. Four pindas should be prepared, one for the preta and three for his ancestors and then the performer requests "I shall unite the pretapiņda with the pindas for the three ancestors of his'; when permitted in the words 'do unite', the performer divides the pretapinda into three parts and puts each third into each of the three pindas with the same two mantras (Vāj. S. 19. 45-46). The Garudapurāṇa (I. 220,6 ) strikes a discordant note in that it states that the pretapiņda is to be divided in two parts, each of which is to be placed inside the pindas for pitāmaha and prapitā maha only.

Sapiņạikarana 

523 

Sapiņdikarana partakes of the character of both ekoddista and pārvana, the first applying to the preta and the 2nd to the three ancestors of the preta, so that in it two kinds of śrāddhas are combined. When the sapiņdikarana rite is completed by the giving of dakṣiņā to the brāhmaṇas, then the preta ceases to be go and himself becomes a pits. The status of being a preta involves the experiencing of great torments due to hunger and thirst and becoming a pitr means being brought in contact with the sraddha devatās called Vasu, Rudra and Aditya.1170 The 

word preta has two meanings, (1) a person who is dead and (2) one who being dead has not the sapindikarana performed for him. The result of sapindana is that the 1171 great-grandfather of the deceased whose sapindana is performed drops out from the list of pitrs entitled to piņda and becomes one called 

lepabhāk' (entitled to only wipings of the hand) and the former "preta becomes one of the pitrs and entitled to participate in the pindas offered at a pārvanaśrāddha thereafter. As stated in the Garudapurāṇa I. 220. 2 the sapiņdikarana-śrāddha is to be performed like the pārvana in the afternoon, 

It may be noted that in some works the mantras recited at the time of pouring the water from the preta vessel into the pitr vessels are different. For example, the Visnu Dh.S. 21. 14 sayg1172 the mantras are 'Samsrjatu tvā prthivi' (May the earth unite thee) and 'samāni va akutih' (Rg. X. 191.4), while the

Grhya-parisista 1173 of Āśy, employs the three Madhumati verses (Rg. I. 90.6-8) and the three fine verses at the end of the Rgveda beginning with 'sangacchadhvam! (Rg. X. 191. 2-4, 'May you unite' &c.). 

Yāj. (I. 254) and Mārkandeya (28. 17-18) provide that Ekoddista and Sapindikarana srāddhas are performed for women also (but not pārvana nor ābhyudayika). About the Sapiņdikaraṇa of the mother there are somewhat conflicting dicta. If a woman dies sonless and her husband is alive, her sapindana is effected with her mother-in-law (Gobhilasmrti II. 102). If a woman dies leaving no son and the husband also is dead, then no sapindana can be performed for her. If she died either on the funeral pyre of her husband 1174 or afterwards (as a Sati) then her son should perform her sapindana with her husband (i, e, the son's father) and there is no separate sapin dana for her. If she was married in the āsura form or she was made a putrikā, then the son should perform his mother's sapin dana with his maternal grandfather; while a son born of a woman married in the Brāhma and three other proper forms may perform her sapiņdana with her husband or the paternal grandmother or the maternal grandfather. In the case of these three alternatives if there is a certain family usage that should be followed; otherwise there is an option. If a woman has a step-son, the latter should perform her sapiņdana with his father, as Manu IX. 183 ( = Vas. 17. 11) indicates. Vide the Mit. on Yāj. I. 253-254 and Sm. C. (on āśauca p. 169) for discus sion of these points and for various alternatives. 1175 

The Nirnayasindhu (III. p. 388) says that there is no sapiņdana for one whose upanayana was not performed when

he died, but if he was more than five years old then the 16 śrāddhas are performed for him (though not sapiņdana) and pinda is offered on bare ground. It may be noted that no auspicious rite like marriage in which abhyudayika śrāddha is necessary can be performed until the sapindana of a deceased person of the family has been effected (except in the case of such absolutely necessary ceremonies as simantonnayana). 

Manu (V. 89-90) prescribes that no water and other rites like sapiņdikarana are offered and performed for those who had left off their faith, who were born of condemned mixed marriages, who entered ascetic orders, who had committed suicide (by hanging, poison &c.), who had embraced heretical doctrines, for women that wilfully seek illicit connection with men, that did harm to their foetus or husband (were guilty of abortion and murder of husband) and that were addicted to drinking surā. Yāj. III, 6 contains similar provisions. It has to be noted that every kind of suicide is not condemned by the ancient smrtis. Vide H. of Dh. vol. III, pp. 939, 958–9 for cases where suicide was not condemned. Except in those cases Yama (q. by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 6) provides that in the case of the persons mentioned in Manu and Yāj. there is to be no āśauca observed, no water oftered, no tears shed, no cremation and no last rites. The Mit. (on Yāj. III, 6) quotes Vrddha Yājñavalkya and Chāgaleya that in the case of those who are guilty of condemned suicide the procedure of Nārā yaņabali should be resorted to after a year and then śrāddha may be offered to them. Then the Mit. describes at length the pro cedure of Nārāyanabali. Vide note 838 b p. 370 above for the Skandapurāņa, Nāgarakhanda 219. 19-21 on the view that śrāddha may be performed on the 14th of the dark half for per sons who committed suicide or who met a violent death. 

The Abhyudayika-śrāddha is to be now described. Āśv. gr. IV.7 mentions in one place only four srāddhas viz. Pārvana, Kāmya, Ābhyudayika and Ekoddista (note 966 above). Many of the sūtras such as Āśv. gr. II. 5. 13-15, Sān. gr. IV. 4, Gobhila gr. IV. 3. 35-37, Kauṣitaki gr. IV. 4, Baud. gr. III. 12. 2-5, the Srāddhasūtra of Kātyāyana (kandikā 6 ) briefly describe this śrāddha. According to most of these sutras this sraddha is performed when there is a lucky event such as the birth of a son, or his caula, upanayana or marriage or there 18the commencement of a charitable (pārta) act (such as the dedication of a well or a tank or a park to the public arch in ASV.

gr. and Gobhila gr. are very brief. They say that in this śrāddha performed on auspicious occasions or on the under taking of meritorious acts an even number of brāhmapas is to be fed, that the rite is to be performed from left to right and that yavas (barley ) are to be used instead of sesamum grains. As this śrāddha is only a modification (viksti) of pārvana ( as said by Aparārka p. 514) all rules of the latter will be applicable to the former except where special directions are given. The Āśv. gr. parisista II. 19, Smộtyarthasāra (p. 56), Pitrdayitā pp. 62-71 give a compact but tolerably full description of this śrāddha. 

In this śrāddha which is to be performed in the morning (except on the birth of a son when it is to be done at once ) the Višve-devas are called Satya and Vasu, it is performed in the forenoon, the brāhmanas to be invited must be even in number, the darbhas are to be straight (and not doublefolded) and are not to be with their roots; the performer wears his sacred thread in the usual form ( and not in the prācināvita form), all actions are to be done from left to right (pradakṣiņam and not prasavyam); the word svadhā is not to be used; yava grains are to be employed instead of sesamum grains; he invites them with the words 'find time to attend Nāndīšrāddha'. The brāhmaṇas say be it so!. He says 'May you two come ( to my house )'; they reply we two shall come'. The performer faces the east or north (but never the south); the mantra about yavas is 'yavosi' (vide note 966 ) 1176 he requests 'I shall invoke the pitrs called Nāndimukha'. 1177 When permitted by the brāhmapas in the words do invoke' he says 'may the Nāndimukha pitrs be pleased'; he offers arghya only once with the words 'O Nāndīmukha pitrs! this is the arghya for you'. Sandalwood paste, incense, lamp are to be given twice; the homa is made on the hand of the brāhmana. the two mantras being 'to Agni, the bearer of kavyal svāhā' and 'to Soma accompanied by the pitrs! svāhā.'

brahmanas are eating the dinner, the Rāksoghna mantras and mantras addressed to Indra and propitiatory mantras may be recited but not the mantras addressed to pitřs (viz, Rg. X. 15. 1-13); when he sees that the brāhmaṇas are satiated, he recites the five verses (Rg. IX. 11.1-5) beginning with 'upāsmai gāyatā narah' (O men! sing for this soma) instead of the Madhumati verses (viz, Rg. I. 90. 6-8) and at the end he makes the brāhmaṇas hear the mantra 'the pitrs have partaken ( of the food ), they have regaled themselves. The performer should ask I shall request the nāndimukha pitrs to utter benedictions' at the stage where (in Pārvana) 'aksayyodaka' is asked for, to which the brāhmaṇas respond with the words 'do request.' The performer employs the word 'sampannam' (was it perfect) in asking about the gratification of the brāhmaṇas, who reply with the word 'susampannam' (it was quite perfect). On the brāhmaṇas sipping water after their dinner, he cow dungs the places where the dinner was taken, strews darbha grass thereon with their tips turned towards the east and offers thereon two pindas for (each of the ancestors) made with the food that remains after the brāhmaṇas have eaten mixed with curds, jujube fruit and prṣadājya 1178 (mixture of curds and clarified butter). The pindas are offered to the mātņs, to the three paternal ancestors and the three maternal ancestors (viz. mother's father, mother's paternal grandfather and her paternal great-grandfather). Some do not offer pindas in this śrāddha (as stated by Aśv. gr. parisista II. 19). The Pitrdayitā and Srāddha-tattva (Jiv. p. 297) say that no mātņśrāddha is to be performed in Abhyudayikaśrāddha by the followers of the Sāmaveda. It is possible that the sraddha for the mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother was inspired by the Anvastakya śrāddha, as the sūtras from Āśv, gr. quoted below will indicate.1178a 

The words Nāndiśrāddha and Viddhiếrāddha are synony mous. When Yāj 1.250 says1179 that the Nāndimukha pitrs should be worshipped with pindas when there is vrddhi (a lucky or auspicious event), he indicates that Nāndīśrāddha and Vrddhi

śrāddha mean the same thing. As noted by the Mit. on Yāj. I. 250 quoting Śatātapa this śrāddha is made of three parts, viz. mātr-śrāddha, pitrśrāddha and mātāmahaśrāddha, 1180 On the other hand the Bhavisya-purāṇa I. 185. 15 states that there are two śrāddhas in this viz. Mātr-śrāddha and Nandimukha-pitr śrāddha. Abhyudayika-śrāddha and VỊddhiśrāddha are treated as synonyms in some works such as the Padmapurana, 1181 though it may be said that Ābhyudayika śrāddha is wider in import than VỊddhiśrāddha, since it is also applicable to srāddha performed on the commencement of a purta act. 

The Vispupurāņa III, 13. 2-7, Mārkandeya 28. 4-7, Padma purăņa (srsti 9. 194–199), Bhavisyapurāņa I. 185. 5-13, the Vispudharmottara I, 142. 13-18 describe briefly the procedure of Nāndiśrāddha and also the occasions on which it is to be per formed. The occasions specified are 1182: on the marriages of sons and daughters, on entering a new house, on naming a child, at the time of Cūdākarma, at Simantonnayana, on the birth of a son, a householder should honour the group of pitrs called Nandi mukha. The Mārkandeya-purāņa 28. 6 notes that some desire that this srāddha should not have Vaišvadeva brāhmanas, but the Padmapurāņa (srstikhanda 9.195) says that in this Vrddhi śrāddha the mothers are to be first honoured, then the fathers. then the mātāmahas and then the Viśve-devas. Hemādri (śr. p. 107) quotes two verses from the Brahmapurāņa to the effect that the father, paternal grandfather and paternal great-grand father are called aśrumukha pitrs, while the three paternal ancestors beyond the great-grandfather are called Nāndimukha pitrs. 1183 The Kalpataru (on śrāddha p. 270) explains these verses as meaning no more than this that in case the three paternal ancestors of a man are living and there is a lucky event, then the devatās for Nāndiśrāddha in his case would be the three

paternal ancestors beyond the great-grandfather. The Bhavisya purāņa notes that according to family usage some did not offer piņdas in Vrddhisrāddha 1183 a. 

The word 'mātarah' has two meanings. Gobhilasmrti 1184 prescribes that at the beginning of all rites the Mātrs together with Ganesa have to be worshipped and it names fourteen mātrs such as Gauri, Padmā, Saci (1, 11-12).1185 In the Mārkandeya-purāṇa ( 88,11-20 and 38 ) they are said to be seven viz. Brahmāni and others. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 217-218 for the Matrs and their worship. 1186 Aparārka (p. 517) quotes verses to the effect that in Vrddhisrāddha one must offer worship to the seven mātřs (Brahmāni and others ), then to one's mother, paternal grandmother, and paternal great grandmother, then to the Nāndimukha pitrs and then to the mātāmahas together with their wives. The Śrāddhaprakāśa (of Viramitrodaya ) quotes Vrddha-Vasistha to the effect that in the Mātrśrāddha (as part of Vrddhi-śrāddha) if a sufficient number of brāhmaṇas be not available then for the groups of mātrs and of mātāmahis four women (for each group) whose husbands are living and who have a son or sons should be invited to dinner 1186a and honoured. 

The Pratisāmvatsarika or Pratyabdika śrāddha has already been described above at great length. It is to be performed every year on the day of death (Gobhilasmrti III. 66 ). It is

laid down that in the case of one's parents this śrāddha par takes of the character of pārvana. 11366 The Bhavisya-purāņa and Skanda state that the Sāṁvatsarika śrăddha is the most eminent among śrāddhas and that if a son does not perform the yearly śrāddha of his parents on the day of death he goes to the horrible Hell called Tāmisra and then is born as a pig in a town. 1187 In connection with this, if the tithi or month of death or both are not known then Bphaspati, the Skandapurāņa, Padma and Bhavisyapurāṇa lay down certain rules, viz. 1188 (1) if the tithi is known but the month is not known, then the śrāddha should be performed on that tithi in the month of Mārgaśīrsa or Māgha; (2) if the month is known but the tithi is not known, then the śrāddha should be performed on the amāvāsyā of the month; (3) if both the tithi and the month are not known, then one should take the tithi and the month when the deceased started from home; (4) if even the day and month of starting be not known, then the tithi and month in which a person hears of the death of a relative should be taken. It is to be noted that the month in pitrya rites is lunar and the words 'dina, ahaḥ, vāsara' in connection with pitrya rites mean 

tithi' ( Aparārka p. 545). There is no pratyābdika śrāddha in an intercalary month (Skanda VII. 1. 206.59 ). 

A few words may now be said about some other śrāddhas. 

A well-known śrāddha is the Mahālayaśrāddha. Some of the Purānas deal with this. The Padmapurāṇa (Srsti-khanda) says 'In the fifth fortnight (pakṣa) beginning from the Full Moon day of Āsādha, one should perform a śrāddha, whether the Sun is by that time in the zodiacal sign of Kanyā (Virgo) or not. The sixteen days when the Sun is in Kanyā are equal to the solemn sacrifices which are completed with the gift of the

best of dakṣiņās. If it is not possible to perform the śrāddha in the dark half (when the Sun is in Kanyā), one may perform it when the Sun is in Tulā (Balance). When the Sun enters the sign of Scorpion (without a śrāddha being performed), the Fathers go away losing all hope and after pronouncing a terri ble curse (on their descendants) they return to their abode.' 1189 The fifth fortnight from the Full Moon day of Āsādha is the dark half of Bhadrapada. The dark half is the preserve of pitrs. In Bhadrapada the Sun is in the middle of its apparent motion in dakṣiņāyana. Therefore the dark half of Bhadrapada is specially chosen as the best period for śrāddha to the pitrs i. e. for the Mahālaya. The śrāddha performed in Bhādrapada dark half is called Mahālaya-śrāddha, since that fortnight is the abode (alaya) as it were of the maha (i. e. festival day ) for pitrs. The real idea is that the dark half of Bhādrapada is specially to be welcomed for a śrāddha when the Sun is in Kanyā during that fortnight and that even if the Sun is not in Kanya the dark half of Bhadrapada is still a good time for a śrāddha to the pitrs. The Skandapurāṇa 1190 also says 'In the fifth fort night from the Full Moon of Āsādha, when the Sun occupies the sign of Kanyā, the pitrs of him who offers a śrāddha on the tithi of the death (of one's father) certainly derive gratification for one year thereafter.' The Kalpataru quotes the Bhavisya purāņa to the effect that if a man has not performed śrāddha in

The first verse आषाढी-occurs in अग्निपुराण 175.33 and is ascribed to जातकर्ण्य by श्रा. कि को. p. 283 and अपरार्क p. 423, which reads the third पाद as श्राद्धकालः म विजेयः. The verse कन्यागते is ascribed to the ब्रह्मपुराण by श्रा.क्रि. को. p. 285 (which reads तुल्यानि देवो नारायणोऽब्रवीत्) and to ब्रह्माण्डपुराण by अपरार्क p. 424 (which reads last पाद as तत्र दत्तं महाफलम्) and to श्लोकगौतम by श्रा. क.ल. p.99. यान्यहानि तु षोडश-These words are explained in two ways : 'कदाचित् पक्ष विवृद्धौ षोडशदिनात्मकोऽपि नभस्यस्यापरः पक्षः श्राद्धकर्मणि कालो न तु पञ्चदशदिनात्मको वेति दर्शयितुमुक्तम् । यद्वा अमावास्याया अनन्तरभूतायाः प्रतिपत्तिथ्या अपि संग्रहणार्थ तिथि षोडशकः' इत्युक्तम् । प्रतिपदोपि क्षीणचन्द्रवे सापरपक्षतुल्यत्वात् । स्मृतिच. (श्रा. p. 365). There is also a third way viz., including the preceding full moon day along with the 15 days of the dark half. प्रजापतिस्मृति verse 161 is very similar to the verse कन्यागत and कल्पतरु (श्रा. p. 16) quotes it from ब्रह्माण्ड,

Mahālaya (i. e. in the dark fortnight of Bhādrapada when the Sun is in the sign of Kanyā) he should offer it on the 15th day (of the dark half of Āśvina) on which, it is well-known, lamps are lighted.1191 The Srāddha-sāra (p. 113) and the Smrtimuktā phala (on śrāddha p. 745) quote Vrddha-manu to the effect that the latter half of Bhadrapada when the Sun is in Kanyā is called Mahālaya and also Gajacchāyā. Various views are held on the question of the exact day on which the Mahālayaśrāddha is to be performed, viz. it may be performed on any day from the first tithi of the dark half of Bhādrapada to the amāvāsyā or from the fifth of the dark half to the amāvāsyā of Bhādrapada or from the 8th or 10th of the dark half to amāvāsyā or from the 5th of the dark half of Bhadrapada to the 5th of the next fort night or on any day on which the Sun is in Kanyā or on any -day till the Sun enters Scorpion. 1192 Prajāpati states that there are numerous śrāddhas described by the Purāṇas, all of them yield rewards but the Mahālaya (śrāddha) is the most eminent among them. 1193 

The Mahālayaśrāddha is to be performed, as stated by the Mārkandeyapurāņa, in accordance with the procedure of Pārva pašrāddha. 1194 The Smrtyarthasāra states that if it is not pos sible to perform all śrāddhas (except sapindikarana) according to the detailed procedure of Pārvanaśrāddha they should be performed by the procedure called 'Sankalpavidhi', which con sists in performing the details laid down for Pārvana as far as possible except the details of āvāhana, arghya, homa and pindadāna. 1195 The Madanapārijāta (pp. 609-610) also states that when a man has to perform a sankalpa-śrāddha' he need not go through the details of arghyadāna, vikira and there is no āvāhana, no agnaukaraṇa and no pindadāna even, but he has simply to feed a brāhmana or brāhmaṇas.

Mahālayasrāddha

In the Mahālayaśrāddha the Viśvedevas are Dhuri and Locana. This śrāddha is performed for the benefit not only of the paternal and maternal ancestors with their wives, but also for other relatives and persons that are dead (together with their wives, sons and husbands if these be dead) viz. one's step mother, one's wife, son, daughter, paternal uncle, maternal uncle, brother, paternal aunt and maternal aunt, sister, paternal uncle's son, son-in-law, sister's son, father-in-law, mother-in law, ācārya, upādhyāya, guru, friend, pupil and any other relative. 1196 Some perform only for the paternal ancestors with their wives and the maternal ancestors with their wives. The day on which the moon is in Bharaṇī nakṣatra in the dark half of Bhādrapada is called Mahābharani and śrāddha performed on that day is said to be equal to Gayāśrāddha (Matsyapurāņa q. by Śr. K. L. p. 99). The Mahālaya-śrāddha is to be performed on the 12th tithi of Bhadrapada dark half in the case of a sannyāsin and on no other tithi and his yearly śrāddha is to be performed by his son according to pārvana method as in the case of householders. The dvādaśi is sacred to Vispu and yatis always repeat the words 'namo Nārāyaṇāya' and therefore the 12th is the special tithi for the mahālaya śrāddha of yatis. The Mahālayaśrāddha is not to be performed in an intercalary month (malamāsa ). 

Two more śrāddhas that are performed even to this day may be mentioned here. One is called 'Mātāmahasraddha' or "Dauhitra-pratipad-śrāddha'. A daughter's son whose parents are alive can alone perform a śrāddha for his maternal grand-father (together with the maternal grand-mother if she also be dead) on the first tithi of the bright half of Āśvina 1197. A daughter's son can perform it even if his maternal grand father has a son or sons living. It may be performed with or without pindadāna (generally without it) and it may be per formed even if the daughter's son has not been invested with the sacred thread. The Srāddhasāra nutes that the mātāmaha śrāddha is based only on the usage of śistas (p. 24). 

Another is the 'Avidhayānavamiśrāddha', which is per formed for one's mother or other women of the family who died while the husbands were alive. It is performed on the 9thy of

the dark half of Bhādrapada. It ceases to be performed when the husband dies after the woman's death. The Nirnayasindhu notices several views about this and says that one should follow the usage of one's country 1198. According to the Mar kandeyapurāņa in this srāddha not only a brāhmana but also a woman whose husband is alive is to be fed and presents of a girdle, a garland and bangles are to be made to her. 

It will have been seen from the translation of Aøv. gr., Yaj. and the Padmapurana that daksina, according to one's ability, has to be given in each śrāddha towards the end of the rite. The Skandapurana (VI. 218. 12-14) provides that what ever is wanting in mantras or the proper time or in procedure becomes pərfect by dakṣiņā. Srāddha without daksinā is like rain on an arid place or like dancing in the dark or like singing before a deaf person, that he who desires the permanent gratification of himself and his Manes should not offer a śrāddha without dakšiņā. The Rāmāyana shows how on the 12th day after the death of king Dasaratha gifts of jewels, of hundreds of cows, wealth, food in abundance and vehicles, of male and female slaves, of spacious houses were made to the brahmanas. 1199 The Asramavāsikaparva (14. 3-4) recounts the valuable gifts to brahmanas in honour of Bhisma, Drona, Duryodhana and other fallen warriors, adding that persons of all varpas were treated to profuse food and drink. The Vāyupurāņa (chapter 80 ) propounds in great detail the rewards of various kinds of gifts made in śrāddhas. From considerations of space those descriptions are passed over here and only a brief eulogy of the gift of cooked food is given in the note below.1200 The Santiparva (chap. 42.7)

states that while Yudhisthira performed the after-death cere monies of the fallen heroes he erected sabhās, prapās, water reservoirs and the like intending them for each separately. Devala states: 'when the brāhmaṇas have sipped water after dinner, dakṣiņā is to be given' and Bphaspati prescribes 

Dakṣiņā should be given to all the brāhmaṇas according to the learning of them by means of (gifts of) cows, land, gold, clothes. He should do this in such a way that they feel satisfied; one who is well-off should do this specially. '1201 The Āývamedhika-parva (62. 2-5) states that Vasudeva offered śrāddha to his sister's son Abhimanyu and donated to sixty thousand brāhmaṇas, gold, cows, bed-steads, clothes and fed them. A special rule was provided by Brhaspati that the clothes, ornaments, bed-stead and the like, the horse and the like that were used by the father during his lifetime should be presented to the brāhmaṇa invited for śrāddha after honouring him with sandalwood paste and flowers.12014 The Anušāsana parva (chapt. 96 ) states the origin of the practice of giving an umbrella and sandals on the completion of a śrāddha. 

Something must be said about the gift of the bed-stead ( sayyā) used by the deceased on the 11th or 12th day after death. The Garudapurāņa (Pretakhanda 34. 69-89), Padma (srstikhanda 10.12), the Matsyapurāņa highly eulogise the gift of sayyā to a brāhmana and his wife. The Matsyapurāņa states that on the 2nd day after the end of impurity on death the performer (of śrāddha ) should donate a bed-stead possessing special characteristics; on it the golden image of the deceased should be placed and also fruits and clothes. After honouring a brāhmana couple with many ornaments this should be done; then a bull should be let loose (for the benefit of the deceased) and the gift of a dark brown cow should also be made 1202 The Garudapurāņa (Pretakhanda 34.73-82) gives a more elaborate description which appears to be almost identical with the

verses of the Bhavisya quoted by Hemādri. The Bhavisya purāṇa quoted by Hemādri (and from Hemādri by the Nirnaya sindhu p. 596 ) states the mantra to be recited viz. just as the bed-stead of Krsna is never devoid of Laksmi, the daughter of the ocean, similarly my bed may not be empty in each birth that I may have to undergo. '1203 Acceptance of the gift of a sayyā was looked down upon in former times and even now it is only the poor brāhmaṇas (that are not generally learned) that accept this gift. The Padmapurāņa condemns the accept ance of the gift of sayyā in no measured terms. It says 'when a brāhmaṇa accepts the gift of a bed-stead, he should have to undergo the ceremony of upanayana again. In the Veda as well as in the Purāna (the gift of ) a bed-stead is everywhere condemned and all those who accept the gift go to hell.' 1204 

Certain other matters connected with śrāddhas may be briefly touched upon. In very ancient times twelve kinds of sons were recognized out of whom the kṣetraja, 1205 the putrikā putra and dattaka were most important. All these were the sons of two fathers. The question mooted was: to whom were they to offer pindas? The Madanapārijāta (pp. 607-608) quotes a passage from the Hārīta-dharmasūtra 1206 and explains it. Hārīta says: 'seed does not grow without a field. Since it is seen that both are necessary the child born is the child of both. Out of the two (fathers ) the procreator is to be first invoked

1205. The ksetraja son was procreated on the wife or widow of a sonless man by a sagotra (a brother or other agnate) or even an asagotra accor ding to the rules of niyoga, the procreator being called bijin and the hus band on whose wife or widow the son was begotten was called ksetrin. The putrikāputra is of two kinds, (1) a sonless man gives his daughter in marriage to another with the stipulation that the son born of the marriage will be the son of the girl's father (Vas. 17. 17, Manu IX. 127); (2) A daughter herself may be made a son (Vas. 17. 16). A dattaka is a son whom his father or mother gives to another as a son confirming the gift with water (Manu IX, 168). Vide H. of Dh. vol.

(and then the kṣetrin). He (the son) may offer two piņdas to each grade of the ancestors or he may offer a single pinda (to the father and ) may repeat the names of both (fathers ) as to that single pinda. The son of the son of two fathers ) may repeat two names as to the 2nd pinda (i. e. the piņda for paternal grand-father ); the grand-son (of the son of two fathers ) may do the same as to the third pinda (viz. the pinda for paternal great-grandfather). Manu IV. 140 and Gobhila-smrti II. 105 say about the putrikāputra 1207 that he presents the first pinda to his mother (as she was appointed as a son), the 2nd to her father and the third to his father's father. This appears to be one order in which pindas are to be offered by the putrikāputra, while Manu IX. 132 sets out another method since it says that a putrikāputra inherits the entire wealth of his own father if he is sonless and he gives two pindas (i. e. performs two śrāddhas) for his own father and for his maternal grandfather. The Sān. Śr. S. provides 1208 that if there be two fathers, the son should recite the names of both (bijin and kṣetrin ) with reference to the same pinda. Even Yāj. says "The son procreated according to the rules of niyoga by a sonless man on the wife of another inherits the wealth of both and offers piņda to both.'1209 The Mit. adds that if a person appointed to procreate a son on another's wife has a son, then the son so begotten becomes the son of the kṣetrin alone and not of the bijin. As the kṣetraja and putrikā putra have beconie obsolete for several centuries the subject has only an academic interest now. But the dattaka is still in vogue and a few words must be said here about the persons to whom the dattaka offers pindas. The Kalpataru quotes from the Pravarādhyāya a passage on this point which is as

follows: 1210 'If these (i. e. those who are bijin ) have no issue born of their own wives, (the sons begotten by niyoga or given in adoption ) should inherit their wealth and offer pipdas to them up to three ancestors; if both (the bijin and kṣetrin or the giver and taker in adoption) have no other son, then they (sons begotten or adopted ) should offer pinda to both; in one and the same śrāddha they should repeat (the names of) the two ancestors respectively (of the acceptor and that of the begetter) after having separately intended the same pipda for both up to the third ancestor.' The Baud. Dh. S. 1211 quotes a verse as follows The son of two fathers shall give the pinda (to his two fathers and pronounce) two names with each pinda ; three pindas will thus serve for six persons (ancestors).' It would be seen from the passage quoted above from Hārīta that some authorities allowed two separate pindas for each degree of ancestors when there were two in the same degree. Manu IX. 142 lays down the son given should not take the golra and wealth of his natural father; the pinda follows the gotra and wealth; the svadhā (obsequies) of him who gives (his son in adoption) coase or fail (so far as that son is concerned).' This verse has been so interpreted by some decisions of the High Courts and of the Privy Council as to mean that the son adopted becomes totally severed from the family of his birth. This subject has been discussed at great length in H. of Dh. vol. III pp. 690-697 and it is established there that the severance of the son given in adoption is only partial, that the gotra of the natural family persists even after adoption into another family for purposes of marriage and āśauca and that the Nirņayasindhu, 1212 the Dharma-sindhu and the Dattaka candrikā declare that the son given away in adoption into another family can perform the śrāddha of his natural father,

He must drive away the bull together with the young cows in the north-eastern direction and give a pair of garments, gold and a vessel of bell metal to the hots (officiating priest). The blacksmith should be given wages as desired by him and food seasoned with a good deal of clarified butter should be served to (three) brāhmaṇas (at least). That 1219 pool at which a bull let loose (in honour of a deceased person by his son or the like) drinks water serves (reaches the manes. Wherever a bull (let loose) exulting in his strength scratches (or digs up) the earth, that earth becoming abundant food and water waits upon the manes." 1220 In the Anušāsanaparva the pitrs are represented as saying that by letting loose a dark coloured bull, by offering water mixed with sesame and by lighting lamps in the rains a man becomes free from the debt he owes to the pitrs (chap. 125. 73-74). 

In the Garudapurāņa it is stated that the deceased person for whom a bull is not let loose on the 11th day after death permanently remains a preta, even if hundreds of brāddhas are offered for him. The same Purāpa further provides that if a bull be not available on the 11th day, then the effigy of a bull made of darbhas and flour or clay should be symbolically let loose 1221 In the Bhavisy apurāṇa the 12th day after death is prescribed for the letting loose of a bull (N. S. III, p. 505 ). The Nirņayasindhu says that the making of an effigy of a bull with clay, darbhas and flour is without authority. Even at present people let loose a bull but owing to the rise in the prices of bulls this is becoming less frequent, Several medieval digests such as the Pitrdayitā (pp. 84, 94), Srāddhaviveka of Rudradhara ( pp. 69-77), Nirnayasindhu (III. pp. 595–596 ), Suddhiprakāśa

he should himself bathe his body with the water in) the jars with verses of Puruṣasūkta and with pañcagavya and pure water and eat in the evening food mixed with sesamum grains together with clarified butter. He should give dinner to brāhmanas for the gratification of the servants of Yama. On the 4th day he burns (the effigy) with mantras. He should offer water and pinda with the words 'pinda to me of such and such a gotra for benefit in the next world; svadhā namah.' With these words he should bring to a close the rite. He should observe impurity for ten days for himself, but his agnates have not to observe impurity for him. On the 11th day he performs ekoddista. They also cite the following verse 'one who is in distress, a woman and a südra having burnt one's body (i. e effigy) with mantras should perform all rites on that very day. This is the revela tion. In the case of women the rite is performed silently or with (?) Vedic mantras. In this way he should perform his own srāddha every month for a year and at the end of each year up to twelve years. And then he should stop. When he is not able to do all these ( himself) his son and the like may perform them. They also recite the following verse; Although heirs may be alive-one may perform one's śrāddha while alive, having quickly set about doing everything according to the rules. except Sapindana. One should not make delay as to the time specified above, since life is evanescent '.". 

It may be noted that the Baud. gļhyaśeṣasūtra III. 22 contains a very brief procedure of the same rite, but therein two verses of Kanva and one of Viṣņu are quoted. It appears that this is a later addition. The text of Baud. grhyaśeṣasūtra III. 19 is quoted by Śr. Pr. pp. 361-363. But the Srāddha prakāśa also quotes a long passage from the Lingapurāṇa and explains it (pp. 363-368). The procedure in the Lingapurāṇa. however, materially differs from that of Baudhāyana. It is passed over here from considerations of space. The Sraddha mayūkha also gives an elaborate description. Some of its provisions are stated here. In Jivat-śrāddha the word preta: should nowhere be used. An effigy of the person is made with fifty kusas and is to be burnt by another with the mantra ‘kravyādam-agnim' (Rg. X. 16. 9). The person has to kindle fire on the banks of a river with his face to the south with his mTUR grhya fire or ordinary fire and has to dig up a pit and make bob prayer to the earth as in the case of an actual death.

Śrāddha to himself by one living

It contains a far more elaborate procedure than that of Baudhāyana and is in prose. It contains many of the provisions of Baudhāyana. Further details are passed over here. 

The provision of a śrāddha for a living person offered by himself is a perversion of the ancient idea of śrāddha. The basic and fundamental conception of a śrāddha was to gratify the spirits of deceased ancestors. People had gone crazy with the idea of śrāddhas and invented this new mode to satisfy that craze. I have known persons that performed Jivat-śrāddha, though they had sons, younger brothers and nephews who would have certainly performed śrāddhas for them on their death. 

It is customary to make a gift of a cow with a calf to a brāhmaṇa, preferably a kapilā сow, on the 2nd day after the period of āśauca. Often times this is the only cow given, and the cow called Vaitarani referred to above (p.183, note 427) is rarely donated in the midst of the sorrow and turmoil immediately on the death of a dear and near relative. A declaration is first made that a gift of a cow will be made and then water is poured on the hand of a brāhmaṇa. Then holding kušas in his hand the donor makes a gift of the cow with a formula noted below 1224 The donee replies with the words 'om svasti' (Yes, may it be well!). Then daksinā (in gold or silver coins ) is given and the brāhmaṇa says 'om svasti', holds the tail of the cow and repeats a Kāmastuti (eulogy of Kāma) 1225 according to the recension of the Veda he has studied. The Anušāsana parva ( 57. 28-29 ) eulogises the gift of a kapilā cow with the calf, given with a milking pail of bell-metal, whose horn tips are decked with gold, by stating that such a gift not only saves the donor in the other world but also his sons, grandsons and family for seven generations. The Anušāsanaparva (77.10 ff) sets out a legend why the kapilā cow is the best of all cows. 

The Purāṇas and digests devote a good deal of space to śrāddhas at tirthas and at Gayā. Vide Atri 55-58, Vāyupurāņa 83. 16-42, Hemādri (on Śr.) pp. 1568 ff and 1575 ff. This sub ject will be briefly dealt with in the section on tirthas.

Much is said on the question whether śrāddhas should be performed in the intercalary month. The intercalary month is called by various names, viz. Malimluca (Kathaka Sam. 38. 14),1226 Samsarpa or Amhasaspati (Vaj.S:7.30 and 22.31), Mala māsa, Adhimāsa. An intercalary month is known even to the Rg veda (Rg. I. 25.8). The vendor of soma and the thirteenth month are condemned as pāpa (sinful) in the Aitareya Brāhmaņa 1227. The Parāṇas tried to bolster up the intercalary month by calling it Purusottama-masa (i. e. the month of Visnu) but the original stigma attaching to the 13th month seems to have persisted. The general rule about an intercalary month is stated by the Grhyaparisista : 1228 the month called Malimluca is polluted and springs from sin; it is condemned for all acts; it should be discarded in all rites in honour of gods and pitrs. But exceptions to this sweeping prohibition have been recognized. Hārīta provides 1229 that all śrāddhas that come after Sapindana are not to be performed in an intercalary month, Vyāsa laid down 1230 that such ceremonies asjatakarma, annaprasana, the navašrāddhas, sraddha on Maghā and the thirteenth tithi, the sixteen śrāddhas, bath, gifts, japa and śrāddha at the time of the eclipse of the sun or moon-these should be performed even in an intercalary month. The Smrtimuktāphala concludes (p. 728 ) that there is no blemish in performing a śrāddha in an intercalary month provided it is to be performed before the end of one year from death. It is provided by Bhrgu 1231 that the sāmvatsarika śrāddha of those who die in an intercalary month

may be performed in the intercalary month, but if there be none such then in the ordinary month of the same name. When the tithi for performing a śrāddha comes and there is then an intercalary month, Vĩddha-Vasistha says that śrāddha should be performed in both months, 1232 

Further discussion about what may be done in Malamāsa and what is prohibited therein will be taken up in the section on Kāla. The question as to the day on which a śrāddha is to be performed if the tithi is spread over two days or if there is a kṣaya of the tithi will also be discussed in that section. 

Some of the works on śrāddha such as the Pșthvi-candro daya deal with what is called 'sanghāta-śrāddha.' 1232a When on the same day several persons die, but not at the same time, then the śrāddhas for them should be performed, as said by Rsyasrnga, in the order in which they died. But if five or six persons die at the same time on the same day (as when a vessel sinks in the sea or a market is burnt down all at once ), then the order in which śrāddhas are to be performed is determined by the nearness of relationship to the performer of śrāddha in the case of each. For example, if a person's wife, son, brother and paternal uncle meet death at the same time, then the order should be this that the grāddha of the wife is performed first. then of the son, then of the brother and then of the uncle. If the parents die at the game time by accident, then the father's cremation or other rites should be first performed and then of the mother. 

Provision is made if the performance of a śrāddha is rendered impossible by some obstacle. Rṣyaśạnga provides 1233

if impurity (on death ) intervenes when a śrāddha is to be offered to the pitrs, śrāddha should be offered at the end of the period of impurity. If an obstacle arises at the time when an ekoddista is to be performed, the śrāddha should be performed in another month on the same tithi'. This last refers to a monthly śrāddha. If any of the sixteen śrāddhas fails owing to an obstacle it should be performed on the amāvāsyā or better still on the 11th day of the dark half. If there is an obstacle owing to impurity on death in the performance of a monthly śrāddha or yearly śrāddha it should be performed at the end of the impurity or on amāvāsyā. 1234 The Padmapurāņa (Pātālakhanda 101. 68-70) provides similar rules. If the obstacle is the performer's illness or his inability to collect materials or his wife being in her monthly illness, he may offer āmaśrāddha described above. 

It may be noted that while great emphasis was laid on inviting a very learned brāhmana at a śrāddha, that object was often frustrated in practice by the provisions made in certain smrtis that one 1235 should not partake of śrāddha food for three years after sapindana (which is often one year after death) and that by dining at a śrāddha in the first year one eats the bones and marrow of the deceased, in the second year his flesh. in the third year his blood and śrāddha in the 4th year is (somewhat ) pure.

This is on the same lines as acceptance of gifts. A donor collected merit by making gifts, but it was for the acceptor to decide whether he should accept gifts. The ideal

placed before brāhmaṇas was that one, though entitled to accept gifts on account of his vedic learning and tapas, should not accept gifts, if he desires to secure the highest world (Yāj. I. 213), while Manu IV. 186 affirms 1236 that though entitled to accept gifts a brāhmana should not again and again resort to that method, since the spiritual power that he acquires by Vedic study is lost by accepting gifts. Manu IV. 85-86 (= Padma V. 19. 236-237) say that acceptance of a gift from the king is terrible (in its consequences) and Padma warns that gift appears sweet like honey but is like poison (i.e. deadly in its effects). This reasoning applied with greater force to officiating and dining at a śrāddha, where not only gifts are to be received, but also sumptuous food that will please the palate is served in abundance. 

It has been seen above how the most ancient literary monument, viz. the Rgveda, shows that the funeral rites per formed immediately after death were prompted by affectionate concern for the departed spirit mingled with some element of fear, that the object of those rites was to provide sustenance to the departed spirit and to endow it with an intermediate body before it became one of the pitrs. It has also been found that in the most ancient times of which we have literary evidence, there were rites for the worship of ancestors, being the Pinda pitryajña performed every month on amāvāsyā, the Mahāpitr yajña performed in the Sākamedha and the Astakā śrāddhas. Gradually the rites for deceased ancestors became more and more frequent, all-inclusive and elaborate, so that ultimately an exaggerated importance came to be attached to the cult of śrāddhas over which there was an enormous expenditure of time, effort and wealth. The question now arises what Indians of the 20th century should do about śrāddhas. One finds that in these days when many brāhmaṇas even do not engage in any of the five daily obligatory yajñas (the pañca-yajñas), they are so licitous to offer śrāddha at least once a year to their ancestors. The following may be therefore suggested as a via media for all kinds of people. Those who have faith in the duty of performing śrāddhas and their efficacy for the benefit of

the dead may perform them on a small scale, bearing in mind the emphatic admonition of Manu (III. 125-126 ), the Kūrmapurana II. 22. 27, Padmapurāṇa V. 9. 98 1237 that one should desist from extravagance in the matter of śrāddhas, particularly in the number of brāhmaṇas to be invited. Those whose faith is shaken or shattered by the onrush of modern ideas and English education or firm belief in the doctrines of karma and punarjanma should also remember one thing. The main underlying conception of śrāddha is certainly admirable, viz, a tender and affectionate regard for one's near and dear relatives. It is a good practice to set apart at least one day in a year for the remembrance of one's near and dear relatives that are no more, to invite relatives, friends, and learned people to a dinner in memory of the dead and to bestow monetary gifts on poor but learned persons of character and devoted to the practice of plain living and high thinking. This will be in keeping with our past traditions and will also give a new orientation to and infuse new life into practices and usages that have become lifeless and meaningless to many people. From very ancient times one of the fundamental con ceptions of our faith has been the idea of three debts owed to sages, gods and pitrs. The debt owed to the ancestors is paid off by the procreation of a son who would offer pindas to his (and therefore also to his father's) ancestors. This is a grand conception, Nothing can be more sublime than the formula which one has to repeat at the time of offering pindas and water (with sesame) at Gayā 'may those of my ancestors that are in the form of pretas be all satiated by means of the (balls made) of barley flour mixed with sesame and may everything, whether moving or immoveable from Brahmā up to blades of grass derive satisfaction from the water offered by me.'

SECTION IV CHAPTER XI 

TIRTHAYĀTRĀ (pilgrimages to holy places ) 

All religions have laid great emphasis on the sacredness of certain localities and have either enjoined or recommended with great insistence pilgrimages to them. Among the five incumbent practical religious duties1237 of a Moslem, pilgrimage at least once in his life to Mecca and Medina, the birth place and burial place of the prophet Mohammad, is one. The four places of pilgrimage for Buddhists have been the place of the birth of Buddha (Lumbini or Rummindei), the place where he attained perfect enlightenment (Bodh Gayā), the place where he set in motion the wheel of dharma by delivering his first sermon (at Sārnāth near Benares ) and the place where he passed away into the state of nirvana (Kusinārā). Vide Mahāparinibbānasutta (S. B. E. vol. XI. p. 90). For Christians Jerusalem has been the holiest place and no religious com munity except the Christians undertook in historic times several great military pilgrimages. The crusades were launched to free the Holy Land of Christians from the domination of Moslems. In spite of what Gibbon says 1238 somewhat cynically about those who joined the crusades, it must be admitted that there were thousands among the crusaders who risked their lives and fortunes in the pursuit of an ideal. In India holy places have played a very important part. Large rivers, mountains and forests have always been venerated as sacred1239 

1237. Vide S. B. E. vol. VI. Introduction LXXI, for the five duties. The pilgrimage is called Haj and the Moslem who performs it is entitled to be called Hāji. 

1238. Gibbon remarks 'At the voice of their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide arose by thousands to redeem their souls by repeating on the infidels the same deeds which they had exercised against their christian brethren and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by offenders of every rank and denomination' Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, vol. VII (ed. of 1862 ) p. 188.

Advantages of pilgrimages 

553 and as the abodes of gods. In ancient and medieval India pilgrimages brought many advantages to the community as well as to the pilgrims themselves. Though India was divided into many kingdoms and the people of India followed several cults and sub-cults, pilgrimages tended to foster the idea of the essential and fundamental unity of Indian culture and of India also, Benares and Rāmeśvara were held sacred by all Hindus, whether they hailed from the north of India or from the peninsula. Though the Hindu community was broken up into numerous castes and suffered from caste exclusiveness, pilgrim ages tended to level up all men by bringing them together to the same holy rivers or shrines. The traditions associated with holy places, the discipline through which the pilgrims passed, association with holy and philosophic men and the whole atmos phere and environment at tirthas made it easy for pilgrims to remain at a high spiritual level and inculcated in them a mood of reverence that lasted long even after they returned from the pilgrimage, Pilgrimages supplied the much needed stimulus to draw ordinary men away from selfish pursuits and to make them think of the higher and more enduring moral and spiritual values. These obvious benefits and the belief that a holy place was the abode of some divinity led ancient dharmaśāstra writers to lay emphasis on visits to tirthas. The Visņu Dh. S. provides 1240 that the dharma common to all men comprises the following: forbearance, truthfulness, restraint of the mind, cleanliness, charity, control of the senses, ahimsā, obedience to elders, visiting holy places, compassion, straightforwardness, 

(Continued from the last page) beauty so that her mind could come out of its world of narrow necessities and realize its place in the Infinite. This was the reason why in India a whole people who once were meat-eaters gave up taking animal food to cultivate the sentiment of universal sympathy for life, an event unique in the history of mankind.' There is a fundamental difference in the outlook of modern Westerners and that of ancient and medieval Indians (which persists to a large extent even now). If there is a beauty spot anywhere most men in the West would think of building a hotel there for tourists, while ancient and medieval Indians would have thought of erecting a shrine there.

freedom from avarice, honouring gods and brāhmanas and freedom from jealousy. Modern men whose faith in some of the aspects of the religious beliefs of our forefathers has been weakened or altogether sapped by the sight of the professional ministrants at the tirthas and their rapacity and ignorance 

should not judge the ancient attitude towards tirthas harshly. 

The word tirtha occurs frequently in the Rgveda and other Vedic samhitās. In several passages of the Rgveda tirtha appears to mean a road or a way (e. g. in Rg. I. 169.6 'tirthe nāryaḥ paumsyāni tasthuḥ', Rg. I. 173. 11 tirthe nācchā tātrsānam-oko', Rg. IV. 29. 3 'karan-na Indrah sutirthābhayam ca.' In gome places tirtha may be taken to mean a ford in a river, as in Rg. VIII. 47. 11' sutirtham-arvato yathānu no neṣathā sugam &c.', Rg. I. 46. 8 'aritram vām divas-prthu tirthe sindhūnām rathah'. In Rg. X. 31. 3 tirthe na dasmam upa yantyūmāḥ', tirtha probably means 'a holy place'. On Rg. VIII. 19. 37 'Suvāstvā adhi tugvani' the Nirukta IV. 15 explains that Suvāstu is a river and tugvan means 'tirtha' (either a ford or a holy spot). In the Tai. S. VI. 1. 1.1-2 1241 it is said that the sacrificer is to bathe at a tirtha (probably a holy river). The Rudras are said to prowl about tirthas (ye tirthāni pracaranto sľkāvanto niṣangiņaḥ) in Tai. S. IV.5.11.1-2 and Vāj. S. 16. 61 (reads 'sýkāhasta'). In the Sānkhāyana Br. 1242 it is said that Day and Night are the sea that absorbs every thing and the twilights are the unfathomable tirthas (of the sea)'. Tirtha also means the way between the 'utkara' and 'cātvāla'pit for going to or coming from the sacrificial ground (the vihāra ).124?a Vide H. of Dh vol. II. p. 984. 

It is said that, just as some parts of the human body (e. g. the right hand or ear) are held to be purer (than others), so some localities on the earth are held to be very holy. Tirthas are held to be holy (on three grounds, viz.) on account of some wonderful natural characteristic of the locality or on account of the peculiar strikingness (or grandeur) of some watery place or on account of the fact that some (holy ) sages resorted to

them (for bathing, austerities &c.). Tirtha, therefore, means a locality or spot or expanse of water which gives rise to the accumulation of righteousness (merit) owing to its own peculiar nature without any adventitious circumstance (such as the presence of Sālagrāma near it ).1243 Or it is better to say that those localities that have been technically spoken of by wise and great sages as tirthas are tirthas, just as Papini employs such technical terms as Nadi and Vrddhi in his grammar. The Skandapurana.1214 says that a spot of the earth resorted to by ancient good men for the collection of merit is called tirtha and that the main thing is to go to (i. e, associate with holy ) men and pilgrimage is only a secondary object. 

In the Rgveda waters, rivers in general and certain named rivers 1245 are referred to with great reverence as holy and are deified. In Rg. VII. 49 the refrain of all four verses is 'may the divine waters protect me' (ta apo devir-iha mamavantu). In Rg. VII. 49.1 waters are spoken of as purifying ( punānāḥ). Rg. VII, 47, X. 9, X, 30 1246 are hymns addressed to waters as divinities. They are said to purify a man not only physically but are also invoked to rid a man of all sins and lapses from the right path. The Tai. S. II. 6.8.3 asserts that all deities are centred in waters (āpo vai sarvā devatah). In the Atharvaveda 1247 (I. 33.1) waters are described as holy and purifying and are invoked to confer happiness. About twenty rivers in all

X. 64. 8 speaks of rivers that are thrice seven and the next verse mentions the three great rivers, viz. Sarasvati, Sarayu and Sindhu, as divine and as mothers. Sāyana remarks that these three are the principal rivers of three groups of seven rivers each. Seven Sindhus are mentioned in many verses of the Rgveda (e. g. I. 32. 12, I. 34. 8, I. 35. 8, II. 12. 12, IV. 28. 1, VIII. 24. 27, X. 43. 3) and the Atharvaveda (VI. 2. 1 'apām napāt sindhavaḥ sapta pātana). The river Sarasvati has three hymns devoted to it as a deity in the Rg. (viz. VI, 61, VII, 95 and 96) and it is addressed in many detached verses also. Rg. VII. 95. 2 says that the pure Sarasvati, flowing from the mountains up to the sea, alone among rivers, knew the prayer of Nāhusa and granted it. A king and smaller people are said to dwell on the banks of the Sarasvati (Rg. VIII. 21. 18 ) 1249. The impetuous and roaring

1249. Vide Journal of the Department of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. XV. pp. 1-63, where an attempt is made to show that Sarasvati was really the Indus. But this is far from acceptable. Sarasvati, Sarayu and Sindhu are mentioned in Rg. X. 64. 9 as the chief rivers of three groups. Prof. Ksetreschandra Chattopadhyaya refers to the conflict of views among scho lars, admits (on p. 22) that, in the 10th Mandala of the Rgveda, Sarasvati - cannot be identified with the Indus, that in Rg. III. 23. 4 Sarasvati cannot be held to be the Indus and asserts that in Mandalas VI and VII of the Rg. Sarasvati is really the Indus, while in Mandala X it is not so. The whole argument is vitiated by several unwarranted assumptions. He takes the modern conditions of Sarsuti as existing in the early Vedic period. What reasons are there against holding that the Sarasvati was in very ancient times a mighty river like the modern Indus and that owing to volcanic eruptions or earthquake upheavals and convulsions in the dim past the Sarasvati lost its mighty character? Further how many centuries does he postulate as having intervened between the composition of the 6th and 7th Mandalas and Rg. III. 23. 4 and Rg X. 75.5? [1 for my part find no diffia culty in holding that in Rgvedic times there were two mighty rivers, the Sindhu (Indus) and the Sarasvati. I cannot enter into this question in greater detail here. Even in the Puranas the Sarasvati is described springing from a Plaksa tree, as flowing through Kuruksetra, as rendingas under thousands of hillocks and as entering the Dvaita forest.

flood of the Sarasvati impinging by its powerful waves against the tops of hills is referred to in Rg. VI. 61. 2 and 8 1250. In VII. 96. 1, Sarasvati is spoken of as asuryā (of divine origin) among rivers. Sacrifices are said to have been performed on the Drsadvati, the Apayā and Sarasvati (Rg. III. 23. 4). In Rg. II. 41, 16 Sarasvati is called the best of rivers and goddesses (ambitame naditame devitame Sarasvati). Rg. I. 3. 11-12 praise 1251 Sarasvati as a river and a deity, as a purifier (pāvaka), as the impeller of sweet but truthful words and the inspirer of good thoughts and as bringing to notice its great flood of waters. From Rg. VII. 95. 2, VII. 49.2 and I. 71. 7 it is obvious that the Rgvedic sages knew that the seven rivers fell into the sea. It would be proper to hold that the seven rivers are Sindhu (Indus), the five rivers of the Panjab and the Sarasvati. Though from the Rgveda passages cited above it appears that in the times of the hymns of the Rgveda Sara svati was a big river with abundant waters, that it flowed between the Yamunā and Sutudri (X, 75. 5), in the times of the Brāhmaṇas it disappeared in the sands. It is now gene rally identified with the modern Sarsuti which is lost in the desert at Bhatnair. 7 The Vāj. S. 34. 11 says that five rivers together with their tributary streams fall into Sarasvati, 1252 There were three sattras called Sārasvata, viz. the first in hon our of Mitra and Varuna, the 2nd for Indra and Agni and the third for Aryaman. The dikṣā (consecration ceremony) was to be performed on the south bank of the dry bed of the Saras vati where it disappeared underground 1253. Vide Tāņdya Br.

25.10 for the first Sārasvata-sattra, 25. 11 for the 2nd and 25.12 for the third. The land between Vinasana and Plaksa Prāsra vana (which was the source of the Sarasvati) was the proper locality for Sārasvata sattra. At the confluence of Sarasvati and Drsadvati an isti to Apām Napāt was performed wherein boiled rice (caru) was the offering.) From the place where the Sarasvati disappeared up to Plaksa-Prāsravana the distance was a journey on horse-back for forty days and nights. When the sacrificers (in the sattra) reach Plaksa Prāsravana they should stop the performance of the items of the sattra and undergo the Avabhrtha bath near the river Yamunā (modern Jumna) which flows through the country called Kārapacava (and not in the Sarasvati even if it had water). For details, vide Kātyāyana Srautasūtra (10. 15-19) which mentions (in 10. 19.1) a spot called Parīṇaḥ in Kuruksetra where the Vedic fires were to be kindled, the Āśv. S. S. 12. 6. 1-28 which adds that at the distance of each throw of the Samyā from 

the Vinaśana one day is to be spent by the sacrificers, 6, the Kātyāyana Srauta-sūtra (24. 5-6) which states that the 

isti at the confluence of the Drṣadvati and Sarasvati is to be offered to Agni Kāma, Ap. S. S. 23. 12-13 (which gives more details than any one of the other three sutras ). In the Ait. Br, a story is narrated that the sages performed a sattra on the Sarasvati and Kavaṣa who was sitting amongst them was driven out by them as not a brāhmana but the son of a female slave and left in a sandy desert with the idea that he

The Brāhmana and Srautasūtra pass ages clearly show that there were holy places in the comparatively small part of India up to the Yamuna where the Sarasvata sattras had to be carried on STATUS The importance of holy places, visiting them and performing religious til there were known in the Brahmana period at least a thousand years before Buddhism and Jainism began to spread.

forward came to be called 1254 'Parisaraka'. This shows that ( in the times of the Ait. Br. and long before it the bed of the 

Sarasvati was dry. Devala 1255 mentions several places as Sarasvata tirthas. The Rgveda 1256 VIII, 6.28 appears to hold that the valleys of mountains and the confluences of rivers are sacred. Mountains have been held by most ancient peoples to be the abodes of gods. Mount Parnassus north of Delphi was one of the most holy mountains in classical Greece and Olympus was supposed to be the home of the gods. In the Rgveda Parvata is a dual deity with Indra. 'O, Indra and Parvata! may you two sharpen (or purify) us (our intellects)' Rg. I. 122.3 1257; 0, Indra and Parvata! May you two, being in the forefront of battle, kill with the thunderbolt every one who desires to attack us with an army' Rg. I. 132.6. In Rg. VI. 49. 14 a prayer is addressed to Parvata separately 'May the god Ahirbudhnya, may Parvata and may Savitr bestow on us food together with the waters on account of our prayers'. In Rg. III. 33.1 the two great rivers Vipās (modern Beas) and Sutudri are described as issuing from the lap of mountains. Here the word 'Parvata' is used in its ordinary sense. The Atharvaveda 1258 speaks of a salve (āñjana) from Traikakuda peaks of the Himālaya mountain "May that salve which comes off the Himalaya from Traikakuda (peaks) destroy all wizards and all witches'.

refers to this salve. Gaut., Baud. Dh. S. and Vas. Dh. S. have the same sutra 1259 stating that the detas (localities) that are holy and hence destroyers of sin are all mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the dwellings of sages (rsis), cowpens and temples of the gods. The Vayupurana 1260 and Kūrma state that all parts of the Himālaya are holy, the Ganges is holy everywhere, all rivers falling into the sea and all seas are holy. The Padmapurāṇa (Bhūmikhanda 39. 46-47) says that all rivers, whether flowing through a village or a forest, are holy and that where no name of a tirtha on rivers is known it should be called Visputīrtha. Kālidāsa speaks of the Himālaya as devatātmā (as vivified by the presence of gods) in the Kumārasambhava (I. 1). The Bhagavata V. 19.16 names 27 holy mountains while the Brahmānda (II. 16. 20-23) names thirty. The grandeur and sublimity of snow-capped mountains, of large life-sustaining rivers and of great forests easily in press the minds of almost all people and induce them to think that there is something divine about them, that the Supreme

The बाहेस्पत्यसूत्र III. 81 says: 'तत्रापि रैवतकविन्ध्यसह्यकुमारमलयश्रीपर्वतपारियात्राः सप्त कुलाचला।7. The नील मतपुराण 57 reads 'महेन्द्रो।...ऋक्षवानपि। विन्ध्यश्च पारियात्रश्च न विनश्यन्ति पर्वताः॥." The ब्रह्माण्डपुराण (II. 16.39) and वायु (45.108) observe about rivers falling into the sea: तास्तु नद्यः सरस्वत्यः सर्वा गङ्गाः समुद्रगाः। विश्वस्य मातरः सर्वा जगत्पापहरा: Furat: 1. In some Puranas certain great rivers are said to be specially holy at certain times.

Effect of holy places on the mind 

561 

Being is partially revealed in such surroundings. In Protestant Europe and the U, S. A. hardly anyone performs a pilgrimage to a holy place in these days. Instead, they tour different countries for rest, health and in search of natural beauty and a respite from humdrum existence. But pilgrimage to a place supposed to be holy for the curing of disease is not rare even now. When one reads a work like that of Louis Carell, a great surgeon and a winner of the Nobel prize, on the miracles worked at Lourdes in France (in 'a Journey to Lourdes') one sees that pilgrimage has taken on a new motive in the West. Similarly, pilgrimage to the tombs of unknown warriors has become common owing to the two world wars. 

In Rg. X. 146 a large forest 1261 (Aranyāni) is invoked as a deity. The Vāmanapurāṇa mentions 1252 seven forests in Kuruksetra as holy and as removers of sin, viz. Kāmyaka, Aditivana, Vyāsavana, Phalakivana, Süryavana, Madhuvana and Punyasitavana... 

In the Sūtras and ancient smrtis like those of Manu and Yājñavalkya tirthas do not occupy a very prominent positions But in the Mahābhārata and the Puranas they are highly lauded and placed even above sacrifices. In the Vanaparva 1263 a com parison is made between sacrifices to gods and pilgrimages, Sacrifices require numerous implements, collection of materials, the co-operation of priests and the presence of a wife and so

they can be performed only by princes or rich men. They can not be performed by poor men, who are devoid of wealth, who are without a wife and without friends, who are helpless. The reward that a man gets by visiting holy places cannot be secured by performing such sacrifices as Agnistoma in which large fees are paid (to priests); therefore visiting holy places is superior to sacrifices. But the Mahābhārata (Vanaparva 82. 9-12 and Anusāsana 108. 3-4) lays the greatest emphasis on the cultivation of high moral and spiritual qualities if the full reward of pilgrimages is to be reaped. It says 1264 'He whose hands, feet and mind are well controlled and who possesses know ledge, austerities and a good reputation derives the (full) reward 

of pilgrimages. He who turns his face away from receiving gifts vand is content with what little he gets and is free from vanity 

obtains the rewards of pilgrimages. He, who is free from hypoco risy (or deceit), is not engaged in various undertakings (for earning money), is not a heavy eater, has subdued his senses and is (therefore) free from all sins; so also he who does not fly into a rage, who always speaks the truth, who is firm in his observances, and acts towards all beings by treating them like himself, obtains the full reward of pilgrimages'. The idea seems to be that pilgrimages may help to remove the sins of men who are not possessed of the above characteristics, while those who possess these acquire a great store of merit in addition. The Skanda (Kāśikhanda 6.3) asserts 'snāna cannot be predicated of a man whose body alone is flooded with water; that man who is plunged in restraint of senses, who is pure, relieved of all taint and is stainless, is alone to be called snāta' (as having had a bath). The Anušāsana has almost the same

words (108.9). 1261a The Vāyupurāņa states 1265 "A steadfast (or wise ) man visiting tirthas with faith and controlling his senses would be purified even if he has been guilty of sins; what need is there to say about him whose actions have been pure? One who has no faith, who is full of sins, whose mind is not free from doubts (about the rewards of pilgrimages and the rites there ), who is an atheist and who is bent on bad reasoning-these five do not reap the rewards of pilgrimages '. The Skandapurāṇa (I. 1. 31. 37) remarks that all holy places, sacrifices and various gifts are meant for cleansing the mind (of its sins and sinful proclivities, manaḥ-śuddhi). The Padmapurāņa (IV. 80.9) remarks: sacrifices, vratas, tapas and dāna cannot be carried out fully in the Kali age; but bathing in the Ganges and taking the name of Hari are free from all defects. The Vispudharmottarapurāṇa1266 puts the matter very clearly when it says 'When resort is made to a tirtha, it removes the sins of the sinful and tends to the increase of merit in the case of the good and that a holy place yields fruit to men of all varnas and aśramas.' Some of the Purānas (such as Skandapurāṇa, Kāśikhanda 6, Padma, Uttarakhanda, 237) say that in addition to the holy places on land (bhauma ) there are certain virtues that may be called mental tirthas (in a figurative sense ). According to them "truthfulness, forbear ance, restraint of the senses, compassion for all beings, straight-forwardness, charity, self-control, contentment, celibacy (brahmacarya), sweet speech, knowledge, patience, austerity, are tirthas and the highest tirtha is purity of mind.' They further state that a man who is avaricious, wicked, cruel, hypocritical and immersed in pleasures of senses is still sinful and impure even if he bathes in all tirthas and that fish are born and die in holy waters but they do not go to heaven because their minds are not purified and that even charity, sacrifices, austerity,

cleanliness, frequenting sacred places, learning-all these are not tirthas, if the mind is not pure. 1267 The Brahmapurāṇa ( 25.4-6 ) states 'a heart that is wicked is not purified by baths at holy places, just as a vessel in which surā (liquor ) was carried remains impure even after being washed with water hundreds of times, that tirthas, gifts, vratas, or (residence in ) hermitages do not purify a man whose heart is wicked, who resorts to hypocrisy and whose senses run away (are uncontrolled). Wherever a man who has his senses under control may dwell, there are present Kuruksetra, Prayaga and Puskara'. The Vāmanapurāṇa has a fine1267a Rūpaka about the soul being a river full of the water of control, flowing with truth and having character as the bank and the waves of compassion (for all beings) and states that the soul cannot be purified by water. The Padmapurana (II,39.56-61) extends the meaning and scope of tirthas by remarking that places where Agnihotra and sraddha are performed, a temple, a house where Veda is being studied, a cowpen, the place where a soma drinker dwells, parks, a place where the Asvattha exists, a. place where Purāna is being recited or where one's teacher 

stands or where a chaste housewife dwells, or where a father v and a worthy son dwell are all holy. 

Numberless tirthas and holy shrines have been mentioned from ancient times. The Matsyapurana states 1268 that Vayu declared that there are 35 millions of tirthas in the sky, in the ærial regions and on the earth and all of them are centred in the Ganges; while the Vamanapurana 46.53 states that there are 35_millions of Lingas.

enumerated in detail even in hundreds of years. The Vanaparva 1269 remarks that Naimisa is the best ) tirtha on the earth and Puṣkara in the ærial region, while Kuruksetra is the most distinguished in all the three worlds and that all the ten thousand crores of tirthas are present in Puskara (chap. 82.21). New tirthas were added from time to time and the monetary benefits derived by the permanent residents and particularly by the tirtha priests led them to prepare numerous māhātmyas of an apocryphal character and father them on Vyāsa, the reputed author of the Mahābhārata and the Purāpas. Most of the writers of digests on tirthas follow a process of selection. The Tirthakalpataru of Laksmīdhara, one of the earliest digests (about 1110-1120 AD), devotes more than half the work to Vārāṇasi and Prayāga alone, assigns only two or three pages to such famous tirthas as Puskara, Prthūdaka, Kokāmukha, Badarikāśrama, Kedāra. The Nrsimhaprasāda (Tirthasāra) mostly deals with tirthas in the Deccan and southern India such as Setubandha, Pundarika (modern Pandharpur), Godavari, Krsnā-venyā, Narmadā. The Tri sthalisetu of Nārāyaṇabhatta devotes two-thirds of it to Benares and its sub-tirthas and the rest to Prayāga and Gayā. This unequal treatment arose from various causes, such as the locali ties where the authors lived, their familiarity with the holy places and their predilections. There was also another tendency among the authors of Purānas, Māhātmyas and digests viz. that of great exaggeration and over-statement which is often repellent. If a man reads the description of one tirtha and does not discount much as sheer hollow laudation, he is likely to feel that a pilgrimage to a certain tirtha will yield all the desires in this life as well in the next and that after Visiting a holy tirtha like Kāśi or Prayāga he need not go to any other tirtha, nor need he perform any yajña or act of charity and the like. A few striking passages may be cited here. The Vanaparva remarks that 1270 even gods and sages secured

perfection at Puskara and that whoever takes a bath there and devoutly worships gods and his pitrs secures rewards ten times of what the performance of Aśvamedha might give. About this very tirtha viz. Puskara, the Padmapurāņa says that there is no holier tīrtha in this world. The Vanaparva (83. 145) in its eulogy of Prthūdaka asserts that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is holier than Kuruksetra and that Pșthūdaka is holier than all other tirthas. The Matsyapurāņa puts the 1271 comparative holiness of several tirthas thus 'the waters of the Sarasvati purify after (one bathes for) three days, those of Yamunā in seven days, those of the Ganges at once, while the water of the Narmadā purifies a man at sight of it.' In its eulogy of Vārāṇasī the Kūrm a-purana states 'there is no place higher than Vārānasi nor will there be one' (I. 31. 64). The 'inveterate habit of exaggeration goes so far that it is said that by merely residing in Kāśi till one's death not only does a man become free from the great sin of brāhmana murder but from the never-ending cycle of births and deaths and is not born again.1272 The Lingapurāņa says the same thing. The Vāmana purāņa remarks 1273 that mukti (release from samsāra) can be secured in four ways, viz. by knowledge of Brahman, by śrāddha at Gayā, by loss of life in repelling the carrying away of cows and by residence in Kuruksetra and that those who die in Kuruksetra never come down (to the earth).

The Brahmapurana classifies tirthas into four divisions 1275 viz.daiva (created by gods), asura (those associated with such asuras as Gaya), arsa (those established by sages ) such as Prabhāsa, Naranārāyaṇa and mānusa (created by kings like Ambarisa, Manu, Kuru) and provides that each preceding one is superior to each succeeding one. It enumerates six rivers to the south of the Vindhya and six rivers having their sources in the Himālayas as most holy and as devatirthas, viz. Godavari, Bhimarathi, Tungabhadra, Venika, Tapi, PayosnI, BhagTrathi, Narmada, Yamuna, Sarasvati, Visoka, and Vitasta.. Similarly, Kāsi, Puskara and Prabhāsa are devatirthas (Tirthapr. p. 18). The Brahmapurāņa (175. 31-32) assigns daiva, asura, arsa and manusa tirthas respectively to the Krta, Treta, Dvāpara and Kali yugas.' 

4 There is a good deal of discussion in the Purāṇas and digests about those who are entitled or have the eligibility or capacity (adhikara) for tirthayātrā. The Vanaparva 1276 provides that brahmanas, ksatriyas, vaisyas and sudras, when they have bathed in holy places, are not born again. The same work further states that whatever sin a man or a woman may have committed from birth, the moment a person takes a bath in the holy Puskara all that sin vanishes. 1277 Therefore not only men but women also had the right to undertake tirthayātrā. The Matsyapurana 1278 goes further and asserts that 'Avimukta

(Vārāṇasi ) is the highest cure for men of numerous castes, for men not (recognized as ) belonging to any particular varna, for cāndālas who are abhorred (by people ) and for persons whose bodies are full of diseases and of aggravated sins.' It is stated in the Vāmanapurāṇa: 1279 persons of all the four āśramas, (i. e. brahmacārins, householders, forest hermits and sannya sins ) by bathing in the tirtha (mentioned by it ) save seven generations in their families and that persons belonging to the four varnas and women, when they bathe in tirthas with devotion, see the highest goal. It was provided by the Brahmapurāṇa that a brahmacārin can undertake a pilgrimage only if ordered or directed by his guru, and that a householder whose wife is alive and is chaste must go on a pilgrimage with her; otherwise he would not reap the fruit of pilgrimage. The Padmapurāņa (Bhumikhanda chap. 59-60 ) narrates the story of a vaiśya called Kļkala who went on a pilgrimage with out his virtuous wife and did not reap the fruits of a long pilgrimage (bhāryām vinã yo dharmah sa eva viphalo bhavet, 59. 33). The Tirthacintāmaņi and Tirthaprakāśa quote a passage (from the Kūrmapurāņa) which glorifies Vārānasi ( called Avimukta there ) as follows 1280 'brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras, persons of mixed castes (varṇasankara), women, mlecchas and others who are born in evil forms and are of mixed blood, worms, ants, birds and beasts when they die in Avimukta are born as human beings in Benares and no one guilty of sins dying in Avimukta goes to Hell' As regards 1281 women and sūdras, a smrti verse provided 'Japa, tapas, pilgrim age to holy places, becoming an ascetic (sannyāsin), efforts to attain mastery over mantras and worshipping deities (as a priest)--these six lead to sinfulness in the case of women and

śūdras.' This was explained away by stating that this text refers to undertaking pilgrimage without the husband's permis sion (in the case of a woman) and as to a sūdra in such a way as to be opposed to the primary duty of a śūdra to wait upon learned brāhmaṇas (as laid down in Manu X. 123). Kātyā yana1282 as quoted in the Vyavahāramayukha provides 'whatever a woman does that relates to (benefit in) a future state (i.e. state after death) without the permission of her (husband's) father, husband or son, would become fruitless.' It is clear therefore that it was recognized early that tirthayātrā was a popular way - for redemption of sins in the case of all classes of men and women. Though a Hindu woman succeeding as heir to her husband's estate has only a limited and qualified ownership over it, judicial decisions have recognized that she can alienate a small portion of her husband's estate for the expenses of a pilgrimage to Gayā for performing her husband's śrāddha for the latter's spiritual benefit or of a pilgrimage to Pandharpur. Vide Muteeram v. Gopal 11 Beng. L. R. 416; Darbari Lal v. Gobind 46 All. 822; Ganpat v. Tulsiram 36 Bom, 88 (pilgrimage to Pandharpur).1283 It was also provided that there was no question of untouchability 1284 when bathing in holy waters.

But a gift to the temple of Jagannātha at Puri for bhog (offerings of cooked food) to the deity and for the maintenance of the priests there for the salvation of the husband and the members of his family and for the widow's own salvation was upheld by the Privy Council in Sardar Singh v. Kunj Behari 49 I. A. 383. As seen in note 1294 below, a person on returning from a pilgrimage had to honour and feed brāhmanas. In Dinanath v. Hrishikesh 18 C. W. N. 1303, 1306, where a widow on returning from a pilgrimage to Gayā for the benefit of her husband's soul incurred a debt for feeding brāhmanas and her husband's relatives and alienated a portion of her husband's property, it was held that the debt was one for a spiritual purpose and was binding on the reversioners after the death of the widow.

There is a verse of Bphaspati: 'At holy places, in marriages, in a religious festival (or procession), in a battle, when there is an invasion of the country and when a town or village is on fire, no blame attaches on the ground of incurring contact with untouchable persons or things.'s birt 

In order to guard against the facile assumption that without a change of heart or change in one's sinful mode of life a mere physical act of pilgrimage and bath in holy waters would be enough, some of the texts in the Mahābhārata and Purānas adopted two propositions: viz. the one noted above that it is the pure mind that is a real tirtha and further emphasized that it is better to stay at home and perform all the duties of a householder including the perform ance of vedic sacrifices than to go on a pilgrimage. The Sānti parva 1285 in the dialogue between Tuladhāra and Jājali (a brahmana proud of his tapas) asserts that purodāsa is the holiest of offerings, that all rivers are (holy like ) Sarasvati and all hillocks (and not merely Himālaya and the like ) are holy, that one's soul is a tīrtha and advises Jājali not to be a guest (i. e, to be wandering in quest of tirthas ) to several countries. The Tirthacintāmaņi and Tirthaprakāśa quote passages from the Brahmapurāṇa that a brāhmaṇa should wander about tirthas after his capacity to perform sacrifices has come to an end, that it is better for a man to stay at home and perform the duties of an householder when he has the capacity and authority to perform iṣtis and yajñas, and that all the tirthas do not come up (in their rewards ) to the performance of agnihotra. 1286 The Kurmapurana 1287 has the following remark able verses on this point. That person who abandoning his proper duties1287 resorts to tirthas does not reap the fruits of

pilgrimage in this world as well as in the next. A person who has to undergo an expiation (for a sin), or who is a widower or who is a householder of the yāyāvara 1288 type or similar persons may resort to pilgrimages. One may go to holy places with his vedic fires or with his wife; he becomes free from all sins and secures the best goal as stated above. One who wants to go on pilgrimages should pay off the three debts, should provide means of maintenance for his sons and should consign his wife to their care.' 

Ancient writers on Dharmaśāstra favoured pilgrimages by prescribing, as stated in the Visnu Dh, S., that 1289 no money was to be demanded from a Vedic student, a forest hermit, an ascetic, a pregnant woman and a pilgrim by a ferryman or by a toll officer and that if he took money from such persons he was to be made to return it. But this prescription was not invariably followed even by Hindu Kings. The Rājatarangiņi (VI. 254-255 and VII. 1008) notices that a tax was levied on Kashmirians performing śrāddhas at Gayā.1296 It appears that Siddharāja king of Anahilavād (1095-1143 A. D.) levied a tax on 

Igrims going to Somanātha at the frontier town Bahuloda. that he remitted the tax at the intercession of his mother and that the tax thus remitted amounted to 72 lakhs of rupees every year (this last may be an exaggeration to glorify Siddharāja).1290 a Moslem kings levied this tax. It appears that a great writer called Kavindrācārya took up the cause of Hindu pilgrims visiting Prayāga and Kāśi and so eloquently pleaded it before Emperor Shah Jehan that the latter remitted the tax altogether

and conferred upon the great scholar 1291 the title of 'Sarva vidyā-nidhāna'. People throughout India felt such relief at the remission of the tax that congratulatory letters and addresses (several of them couched in very poetic language) poured upon Kavindrācārya. These have been published in a work styled ‘Kavindra-candrodaya' by Dr. Har Dutta Sharma and Mr. M. M. Patkar (in the Poona Oriental series), a characteristic verse from which is quoted below.1292 In a remarkable copper plate Inscription in Sanskrit 1293 and Kannada issued by the Hoysala king Narasimha III in Māgha sake 1200 (1279 A, D.) it is said that the king granted the revenues (amounting to 645 niṣkas a year) of a village called Hebbāle to the pilgrims of Kāśī and to god Sriviśveśvara for the purpose of enabling the pilgrims to Benares (including those from the whole of Karņāțaka, from the countries of Telingaņa, Tulu, Tirhut, Gauda and others) to pay off the tax levied by the Turuṣkas (Moslem kings ).1293 

The digests quote certain verses of the Brahmapurāṇa about the rites to be performed when a person decides to start on a pilgrimage. The Brahmapurāņa provides that the intend ing pilgrim should restrain his senses the previous day, should observe a fast and on the next day he should offer wor ship to Ganesa, the gods, the pitřs and honour good brāhmaṇas according to his ability and when he returns from the pilgrimage he should offer similar worship and honour.1294 The digests

explain that on return there is no fast and no worship of Ganesa. He should perform śrāddha in which there is plenty of ghee, honour three brāhmaṇas (at least) with the offer of sandalwood paste &c. and then make a resolve (sankalpa) to go on pilgrim age. The Vayupurana 1295 and the digests lay down that (after the worship of Ganesa, the planets and the deities) he should put on the dress of a kārpati viz, wear a copper-ring, a copper bracelet and reddish garments. Bhattoji (p.5) states that according to some the apparel of kārpaţika is to be put on by a pilgrim going to Gayā. The Padma (IV. 19. 22) prescribes the pilgrim's dress for other tirthas also. The Tir. C. adds that this dress is to be worn only on the journey to a tirtha, when the pilgrim is in a tirtha, but not at the time of performing his daily duties such as taking meals (p. 9). 

There is a difference of opinion among the digests as to whether tonsure of the head is obligatory when starting on a pilgrimage. The Padmapurana 1296 and Skandapurana appear to make it obligatory. The Tirtha-Kalpataru does not 1297 refer to tonsure at all, while a fast at a tirtha is declared by it to be optional. The tendency of later digest-writers is generally to make every religious act more elaborate and harder. The tonsure of the head and beard was prescribed for a sacrificer

when undertaking such solemn Vedic sacrifices as Catur māsyas and Agnistoma 1298 The termination of the stage of Vedic studenthood (samavartana) was also marked by tonsure.1299 Further, tonsure was prescribed when undergoing prāyaścitta for sins (vide p. 122 above). The Tir. C. and Tir. Pr. both quote a verse of Visnu 1300 from the Smrtisamuccaya, viz, 'at Prayaga, on a pilgrimage, on the death of one's father or mother one should cut one's hair; but one should not cut one's hair without cause.'

meaning on the Ganges only at Prayaga.' Both Tir. C.and Tir.

It is not correct to translate tadhane' as ' in the Garbhadhana ceremony' (as Dr. Chaudhuri does on p. 55 of his English Intro. to गङ्गावाक्या०), आधान by itself in धर्मशास्त्र works generally means अग्न्याधान. गर्भाधान is referred to by the word निषेक or गर्भाधान itself. भास्करक्षेत्र is really कोणार्क and not प्रयाग, which latter is called प्रजापतिक्षेत्र in मत्स्य 104.5 and 111. 14.

Tonsure for women at tirthas

in the case of women whose husbands are living only two finger breadths of hair are cut. Vrddha-Hārīta (IX. 386–387) lays down that in the case of women whose husbands are living tonsure of the head should not be carried out, but that holding up all their hair only three finger-breadths should be cut off, Other smrtis like Āpastamba in verse (I. 33-34), Angiras verse 163, Yama 54-55, Parāśara q. by the Mitāksarā on Yāj. III. 263-264. lay down that tonsure is limited to the cutting of two finger-breadths of hair in the case of woman (nārī). Par. M. 1302 II. 1. p. 291 reads 'evam nārīkumārīnām' and holds that nāri means here a woman whose husband is alive'. Although the smrti passages occur in the section on prāyaścitta still by analogy they are to be applied to the tonsure in holy places. As regards widows, ascetics 1303 and sūdras all hair are to be cut. The Tirthaprakāśa finds fault with Vācaspatimiśra for saying that there is no tonsure on the Ganges. When there is such a conflict of views, the final decision rests with the usage of each country or the individual's choice. The Tir. K. (p. 10) appears to hold that honouring the pitrs at the time of starting on a pilgrimage is specially obligatory on a man with means. The texts make a difference between kṣaura and mundana. The latter means 'shaving the hair on the head as well as the moust ache and beard,' while ksaura means only shaving the head. Therefore the Nāradiya says that all sages did not prohibit kṣaura even at Gayā but only mundana is forbidden there 1303c and there is no mundana on the Ganges anywhere except at Prayāga. The Tirthendusekhara (p. 7) gives it as its opinion that tonsure and fast are not obligatory but are only kāmya (i. e. to be done if certain rewards are desired) and points out that śistas do not resort to these two at many tirthas.

The Purāṇas and digests devote some attention to the mode of travel. The Matsya (106. 4-6) states that 1304 if a pilgrim goes to Prayāga in a conveyance drawn by bulls he falls into hell and his pitrs do not accept the water offered by him at the holy place and if a pilgrim because of riches or avarice or foolishness goes in a conveyance (not drawn by bulls) all his effort (as a pilgrim) becomes fruitless and therefore a pilgrim should avoid journey in a conveyance. According to the Kalpataru (on Tirtha p. 11) using a conveyance is forbidden only in the case of pilgrimage to Prayāga (and not in the case of other tirthas), while the Tir. C. (p. 8) and Tir. Pr. (p. 45) quote a verse 1305 which provides that if a pilgrim uses a cart drawn by bulls he is guilty of govadha (killing a cow), if he travels on horse-back (or in a horse-drawn carriage) his pilgrimage yields no fruit, if he is carried by men (in a palan quin or the like) he secures only half the merit but if he travels bare-footed then he wins the full merit. The Padma-purana. (IV. 19. 27) has a similar verse. The Tir. Pr. p. 34 quotes a verse from the Kūrmapurāṇa that those who are unable to perform a pilgrimage otherwise do not incur blame (or loss) by making use of a conveyance drawn by men or a chariot which is drawn by mules or horses. Similarly, a verse of the Visnupurana 1306 quoted by both Tir. C. and Tir. Pr. (pp. 34-35) provides that one should always go on a journey wearing shoes and holding an umbrella in the rains or in summer and armed with a staff at night or in a forest. The Viṣnudharmottara takes a more practical view when it says that to make a pil

The कूर्म (I. 37. 4-5) has the verse ऐश्वर्याल्लोभमोहाद्वा।... वर्जयेत्.

grimage on foot is the highest tapas (austerity) and that if a pilgrimage be made in a conveyance the pilgrim will reap only the reward of the bath. The Tir. Pr. (p. 35) allows the use of a vessel to reach holy places like Gangāsāgara which cannot be reached otherwise.no 

The Tristhali-setu (pp. 1-3) has a long discussion about the sankai pa 1307 (declaration) to be made at the time of start ing on a pilgrimage. The conclusions reached are that the declaration should not include the names of all the holy places intended to be visited, but should expressly state the last one up to which one desires to go, that persons from southern or western India should make a sankalpa about Gayā (and pilgri mage to Prayāga and Kasi will be implied) and that a person from East India should make a sankalpa about Prayaga (and pilgrimage to Gayā and Kāśi will be included as a matter of course) and that (as an alternative method) a man from south or west India should at first make a sankalpa about pilgrimage to Prayāga, then while in Prayāga he should make a sankalpa about visiting Kasi and then in Kāśi he should make a sankalpa about visiting Gayā. A pilgrim from Eastern India should first make a sankalpa about Gayā, then, while in Gayā, he should make one about Kāśi and so on. The Tirthaprakāśa (p. 326) appears to criticize the first method proposed by the Tristhalisetu and states its own view to be that those who intend to visit many sacred places should make a sankalpa in the form 'I shall perform pilgrimage' (Tirtha-yātrāmaham karisye). The Tirthaprakāśa, however, approves of the second method proposed as an alternative, 

That the merit of a pilgrimage could be collected in a vicarious manner is laid down by the Smrtis and Purānas. Atri (50-51) provides 1308 'He for whom an effigy made with kusa grass intending it as a representative is dipped in the waters of a holy place secures one-eighth part of the merit' (that he would have secured by himself bathing in the waters).

of his mother, father, brother, friend or guru, these latter receive one-twelfth of the fruit of the pilgrimage). Another verse of Paithinasi says that he who visits a holy place for money (wages) from another gets only a 16th part of the merit, but he who goes to a tīrtha while bent on another purpose or errand (such as study, business, waiting on a guru) 1309 reaps only half the merit. The Visnudharmottara has a similar verse. It was owing to this idea of collecting merit and God's Grace that wealthy men built Dharmaśālās, tanks, and annasattras and wells for the conveniences of pilgrims and the planting of trees by the sides of roads had in view the comfort of pilgrims as well as of the general public. The Prabhāsa-khanda remarks 'A wealthy man who enables another to perform pilgrimage by providing his own money or conveyances gets one-fourth of the merit of the pilgrimage.' 1310 

The Prāyaścittatattva of Raghunandana quotes from the Brahmāndapurāņa some verses which enumerate fourteen acts that a pilgrim has to give up after reaching the Ganges viz. sauca (punctilious performance of bodily purification), ācamana (sipping water on various occasions in the day), hair (dress ing), wearing nirmālya (flowers taken away after being offered in worship), repeating the Aghamarṣaņa hymn (Rg. 190. 1-3), shampooing the body, sports, acceptance of gifts, sexual dalliance, devotion to another tirtha, praising another tirtha, the gift to others of clothes (worn by oneself), striking any one and swimming across the water of the tirtha. 

One noticeable rule is that, though Manu III, 149 requires strict examination of the ancestry and learning of brāhmanas to be invited at a śrāddha, some of the Puranas provide 1311 that

one should not enter upon an examination of the worth of brāhmaṇas at holy places and this view is endorsed by seve ral digests such as the Kalpataru on tirtha (p. 10), the Tir. C. (p. 10) and the Tir. Pr. (p. 73). The last work remarks that brāhmanas who are known for certain to possess defects deser ving condemnation should be avoided. The Varāhapurāņa goes1312 so far as to say that at Mathurā a pilgrim should prefer to honour a brāhmana born and bred up in Mathurā rather than a brāhmana who has studied the four Vedas (but is a stranger to Mathurā). Similar passages from the Vāyu and Skanda purāṇa have been quoted above in note 910 and there is another similar passage in Skanda, It is provided by the Vāyupurāṇa1313 that when a son goes to Gayā, he should invite only those brāhmanas that have been settled in Gayā by Brahmā and that such brāhmanas are above ordinary mortals, that when they are gratified the gods together with one's pitrs become pleased, that one should not enter upon a consideration of their family, their character, their learning or their austerities and that when the Gayā brāhmanas are honoured the man doing so secu res release (from samsāra). In Vāyu 106. 73-84 and Agni 114. 33-39 and Garuda it is narrated that, after Gayasura fell down and asked for boons which were granted by Visnu, Brahmā bestowed upon the Gayā brāhmaṇas 55 villages and Gayātirtha extending over five krošas, gave them well-appointed houses, desire-yielding cows and trees, but he enjoined on them not to beg or accept a gift from others. The brāhmaṇas, however, greedy as they were, officiated at a sacrifice performed by Dharma (Yama) and begged him for fees and accepted them. Then Brahmā cursed them that they would always be in debt and took away the Kāmadhenu and Kalpavrksa and other gifts. The Agnipurāṇa 1314 (114. 37) adds that Brahmā cursed them to be bereft of all learning and to be full of greed. The brāhmanas then begged Brahmā to favour them with some means of liveli hood (as they had been deprived by the curse of Brahmā of all that had been bestowed on them). Brahmā pitied them and told them that they would maintain themselves at Gayā-tirtha

till the end of the world and that those who would perform Śrāddha at Gayā and worship them (by engaging them as officiating priests and pay them) would secure the merit of having worshipped Brahmā. From this it is clear that the Gayā brāhmaṇas at the time of the composition of the section on Gayā at the end of the Vayupurāṇa possessed the same characteristics as the modern Gayā brāhmaṇas (Gayāls or Gayāwals as they are called) and made the Gayā pilgrimage their business even then (as now). One of the early historic references to Gayāl brāhmaṇas occurs in the Saktipur copper plate of king Laksmanasena of Bengal in his 6th year (i. e. about 1183 A. D.)1315. 

The result of this teaching of the Purāņas was that the brāhmaṇas at Gayā became a guild or a close corporation and the Gayāwals resent the intrusion of an outsider. Disputes between Gayāwals and outside priests and cases of Gayāwals have come before the courts and have gone up even to the Privy Council in England. It has been a usage for orthodox Hindu pilgrims going to Gayā to shave themselves at the river called Punpun, 1315a then on arrival at Gayā to worship the feet of one of the Gayāwal brālmaņas. The Gayāwal himself or his agent takes the pilgrim to the sacred spots (Vedīs) in and around Gayā. The priest is paid a fat fee near the Akṣaya-vata and the Gayāwal puts a garland of flowers on the folded hands of the pilgrim and pronounces the word 'suphala' and utters a blessing that the pilgrim's ancestors would go to heaven on account of the pilgrim's visit to Gayā. In order to keep this business in their own families the Gayāwals have adopted loose and peculiar customs. If a Gayāwal is sonless he makes a gift of his office (called gadi or gaddi) to another Gayāwal, who describes himself as the adopted son of the Gayāwal making the gift. There is no real adoption in the strict sense. Therefore, the so called adopted son retains his rights in the family of birth, he is not severed from his natural family and it is not rare to find that one Gavāwal claims to have succeeded to four gādis (i. e. claims to be the son adopted by several persons simultaneously). The Gayāwals have got books in which they enter the names and addresses of

their clients, who sign such entries and enjoin upon their des cendants to make members of that particular Gayawal family their gurus whenever they might visit Gayā. Thus large incomes and properties come to the hands of the Gayāwals. They send their agents throughout India, who bring as many pilgrims as possible. In Lachman Lal v. Kanhaya Lal the Privy 1316 Council had to deal with the case of a Gayāwal who claimed to be an adopted son without loss of his interest in the property of the natural family on the ground of these peculiar practices of the Gayāwals and that claim was upheld. In Lachman Lal V. Baldeo Lal 1317 the Patna High Court gives a brief summary of the origin, history and customs of the Gayāwals, remarks that though in former times there were several hundred families of Gayāwals their number is now reduced to about 150, that the Gayāwals so-called gaddi is not a hereditary office, but only a business to which a good will is attached. The Calcutta High Court decided in Dwarka nath Misser 1318 v. Rampertab Misser that persons who require religious ceremonies to be performed for their benefit are at liberty to choose the priest by whom they shall be performed, that plaintiffs are not entitled to a declaration that they along with defendants are exclusively entitled to officiate as priests when pilgrims, on their way to the holy city of Gaya, perform the sraddha ceremony of their ancestors on the bank of the sacred river Punpun, and that the plaintiffs could be given a declaration that they are entitled to officiate as priests for such pilgrims as may choose to employ them for the pur pose of religious ceremonies and that the defendants are not entitled to prevent the plaintiffs from the exercise of their calling. In Narayan Lal 1319 v. Chulhan Lal the Calcutta High Court decided how the books containing the names and addresses of pilgrims kept by a joint family of Gayāwals were to be divided at the time of the partition of all the properties of the family. 

The literature on tirthas is probably far more extensive than on any other single topic of Dharmaśāstra. Not to men tion the Vedic Literature, the Mahābhārata and the Puranas

In the Vanaparva (chap. 82-156) and Salyaparva (chap. 35-54) alone there are about 3900 verses on tirthayātrā. To mention only a few of the Purānas, the Brahmapurāṇa devotes about 6700 verses (i. e, nearly half of its total extent of 13783 verses) to tirthas, the Padma about 4000 verses out of the 31000 verses of the first five khandas, the Varāhapurāṇa devotes about 3182 verses to tirthas (out of which about 1400 refer to Mathura) out of about 9614 verses, the Matsya about 1200 verses out of 14002. Besides these, the following well-known digests and works on tirthas deserve mention, The Tirthavivecana-kānda of the Kalpataru of Laksmidhara (G.O.S. series); the Caturvarga-1320 cintāmani of Hemādri (1260-1270 A. D.) contained a section on tirthas (no Ms, has yet been discovered); the Tirthacintamani of Vācaspati (1450-1480 A. D.) published in B. I. series; the Tirtha sāra, part of Nrsimhaprasāda about 1500 A, D. (published in the Sarasvati-bhavana series); the Tristhalisetu of Nārāyanabhatta (about 1550-1580 A, D.) printed by the Anandāsrama Press, Poona; Tirthasaukhya, a part of Todarānanda (1565-1589 A. D.); Tirthatattva or Tirthayātrāvidhitattva of Raghunandana whose literary activity lies between 1520-1570 A. D. (printed in Bengali characters and over and above the 28 tattvas of his Smrtitattva); Tirthaprakāśa by Mitramiśra about 1610-1640 (published in the Chowkhamba Sanskrit series); the Tristha lisetusāra-sangraha of Bhattoji (about 1625); Tristhalisetusāra sangraha of Nāgesa; the Tirthendusekhara of Nāgesa or Nāgoji (published in the Sarasvatībhavana series, Benares, 1936). There are several works on tirthas (not yet printed) mentioned in H. of Dh. vol. 1. p. 554, of which the Tirtharatnākara of Anantabhatta composed at the order of Anūpasimha is probably the largest work on tirthas (ms, no. 1822 in the Anup Library at Bikaner).

dual tirthas such as the Gangā-vākyāvali 1321 (on the Ganges) of Vidyāpati (1400-1450 A. D.) published by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri; Kāsimţtimokṣa-vicāra of Suresvarācārya (published in the Sarasvatībhavana Texts series, Benares 1936); the Gayāśrāddha-paddhati of Raghunandana, the Purusottama ksetratattva of Raghunandana (published by Jivananda). Only printed works have been drawn upon in this work (except where expressly stated otherwise). 

The preliminaries before starting on a pilgrimage to any tirtha prescribed by the purāṇas and digests may be brought together. On a certain day (when a person has decided on tirtha-yātrā) he should take only one meal, then the next day he should shave himself (according to most digests) and observe a fast; then on the day after the fast he should perform his daily duties, should make a sankalpa (declaration of intention) in the form 'I shall perform a pilgrimage to such and such a place and I shall worship Ganeša and my favourite deities for the accomplishment of the pilgrimage without obstacles'; offer worship to Ganesa, to the planets (nine) and his favourite deities with five or sixteen upacāras,1322 then perform a pārvana-śrāddha with plenty of ghee according to his own gļhyasūtra, honour three brāhmanas at least and donate some money to them. Then he should put on a pilgrim's dress as described above (p.573), go round the village in which his house is located (or at least round his own house), reach another village not more distant than one krośa (two or two and half miles) and break his fast by eating the remainder of the food cooked and ghee used for the śrāddha (this applies to pilgrimage to Gayā). He may break his fast 

1321. The last verse of the Gangāvākyāvali is fourFTAST sfi ferragror! Tratat cu: FATOTT saril. This verse shows that the famous Maithila scholar Vidyāpati at least provides the authorities on which the work is based. Some scholars hold that it is really Vidyāpati who wrote the work for commemorating the queen who had honoured and patronized him, The 2nd Introductory verse claims the work as Visvāsa-devi's own. In the araar of Errafa the last verse is faruF HITTA...forri araa T aar:...atl (D. C. ms. No. 216 of 1881-82.

in his own house in the case of other tirthas) and then start. Then the next day he should bathe with pure clothes on and then put on his pilgrim dress and start on his pilgrim age in the forenoon with his face to the east, preferably bare-footed. There are two views here. Some say that on the day on which a man reaches a tirtha he should observe a fast, while the other view is that the pilgrim should fast on the day previous to his reaching the tirtha. In the first case he will have to perform a grāddha on the day of the fast and in that case he cannot actually taste the remnants of śrāddha food but should only smell the cooked food. The Kalpataru (on tīrtha p. 11) and the Tirtha-cintāmaņi (p. 14) quote Davala for the proposition that a fast on reaching a tirtha is not obligatory, but if observed yields special merit.VE

CHAPTER XII omodoro 

THE GANGES 

Since the Ganges is the holiest of rivers and since such highly esteemed tirthas as Kanakhala, Haridvāra, Prayāga and Kāśi are situated on it, it would be most proper to begin the treatment of individual tirthas with the Ganges. 

1. It has been already seen (p. 556) how the Ganges is the first among the many rivers invoked in the famous Nadāstuti hymn (Rg. X.75.5-6). In Rg.1323 VI. 45.31 we have the word 'Gāngyah' which most probably means 'growing on the Ganges'. In the Satapatha Brāhmana XIII. 5.4.11 and 13 and Ait. Br. 39. 9 the victories and sacrifices of Bharata Daussanti on the Ganga and Yamunā are mentioned. In Sat. Br. XIII. 5.4.11 and 13 an ancient gātha is quoted 'At Nadapit the Apsaras Sakuntala conceived Bharata who after conquering the whole earth brought to Indra more than 1000 horses meet for sacrifice.' The Mahābhārata (Anušāsana 26. 26-103) and the Purāṇas (such as Nāradiya, Uttarārdha, chap. 38-45 and 51. 1-48, Padma V. 60. 1-127, Agni chap. 110, Matsya chap. 180-185, Padma, Adikhanda. chap. 33-37) contain hundreds of verses eulogising the greatness and the sanctifying activity of the Ganges. The Skandapurāṇa, Kāśikhanda, chap. 29 (verses 17-168) contains one thousand names of the Ganges. It is not possible to reproduce here even a small fraction of what is said in these works about the Ganges. To most men in India great rivers like the Ganges great mountains like the Himālaya present a double aspect, viz, the physical aspect and the spiritual aspect. A great river apart from its volume of water is deemed to have a spiri tual or divine life which animates it. Tylor (in 'Primitive Culture', 2nd ed.p 477) observes 'What we call inanimate objects rivers, stones, trees, weapons and so forth-are treated as living intelligent beings, talked to, propitiated, punished for the harm they do.' There are separate treatises devoted to the glorifica tion of the Ganges and the pilgrimage to it such as the

The Vanaparva, chap. 85, has a grand eulogy of Gangā in verses 88-97, some of which may be translated here 1324. "The Ganges is equal to Kuruksetra wherever one may take a bath in it, but there is a speciality about Kanakhala and in Prayāga there is the greatest and highest (holiness). If a person, after committing a hundred bad deeds, sprinkles him self with Ganges (water), the waters of the Ganges burn all of them as fire burns fuel. In the Krta age all (places ) were holy, in Tretā age Puṣkara was (the holiest place), in Dvāpara Kuruksetra and in the Kali age the Ganges. The Ganges, when its name is uttered, purifies a sinner, when seen it yields good fortune, when a bath is taken in it or its water is drunk, it sanctifies the family up to the seventh ancestor. As long as (a particle of) the bones of a man touches Ganges water (i. e. lies inside it), so long does the man remain happy (or honoured) in heaven. There is no holy place equal to the Ganges, there is no god higher than Keśava. That country and that penance-grove where the Ganges flows should be known as the sacred spot of success (or perfection) since it attaches itself to the Ganges." The Anušāsana (26.26, 30-31) asserts 'those dis tricts and countries, those hermitages and mountains, in the midst of which the Ganges flows are pre-eminent in punya (religious merit). Even those men who, after committing sinful acts in the first part of their lives, resort afterwards to the Ganges reach the highest world (or goal). That increase in merit) which comes to men that bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges and that then become pure in spirit, cannot be secured

even by the performance of hundreds of solemn Vedic sacrifices.' 1325 

In the Bhagavadgitā (X, 31) Lord Krsna says that among streams he is the Ganges (srotasāmasmi Jāhnavi). The Manusmệti setting out an exordium to a witness to tell the truth indicates that the Ganges and Kuruksetra were the most sacred spots in the age of the Manusmrti.1326 Some of the Purāṇas describe the Ganges as flowing in Heaven (as Mandākini), on the earth (as Gangā) and in the nether regions or Pātāla (as Bhogavati). Vide Padma VI. 267. 47. The Viṣnupurāņa 1327 and other Purāṇas state that the Ganges springs from the toe-nail of the left foot of Visņu. In some Purānas it is said that Siva let off from his matted hair the Ganges in seven streams, three flowing towards the east (Nalini, Hlādini, Pāvanī), three to the west (Sitā, Cakṣus and Sindhu) and Bhāgirathi (vide Matsya 121. 38-41, Brahmānda IL 18. 39-41, Padma I. 3. 65-66). The Kurmapurana (L.46.30-31) and Varāha (chap. 82 in prose) state that the Ganges flows first in four different streams, Sita, Alakananda, Sucaksu and Bhadrā and that the Alakanandā flows towards the south, comes to Bhāratavarṣa and falls into the sea with seven 

mouths.1328 In the Brahmapurana (73. 68-69) the Ganges is described as sprung from the foot of Visņu and as established in the matted hair of Mahesvara (Siva). 

The Vispupurāņa eulogises 1329 the Ganges as follows: The Ganges purifies all beings from day to day when its name is

heard, when one desires to see (it), when it is seen or touched or when its waters are drunk or when one plunges into it or when one takes (or sings) its name; when people utter the name 'Ganges' even though living at a distance of hundreds of yojanas, their sins accumulated in three births are destroyed.' The Bhavisyapurāņa 1330 has a similar verse 'one becomes free from sins at once by seeing the Ganges or touching it or drink. ing its water and by uttering the name Gangā and also by remembering it.'1331 The Matsya, Kūrma, Garuda and Padma remark that the Ganges is easy of access everywhere but is difficult to reach at three places viz. at Gangādvāra (Haridvāra), at Prayāga and where it joins the sea and that those who bathe therein reach heaven and that those who die there are not born again. The Nāradiyapurāṇa, on the other hand, says that the Ganges is difficult of access everywhere, but much more so at three places. The man, whether desiring it or not, who draws near the Ganges and dies (near it) secures heaven and does not see hell (Matsya 107.4).1332 The Kürmapurāṇa represents that the Ganges 1333 is equal to all the 35 millions of holy places declared by Vāyu in the heaven, in mid region and on the earth and that all of them are represented by the Ganges. The Padmapurāṇa asks what is the use of sacrifices rich in large wealth, what is the use of very difficult austerities when there is the Ganges honoured easily and gracefully that yields Heaven and mokṣa'? A. similar verse occurs in the Nāradiya-purāṇa 'what is the use of Yoga with its eight angas, of austerities, of solemn (Vedic) sacrifices? Residence

on the Ganges alone is superior to all these' 1334. Two verses of the Matsya-purāņa 1335 deserve mention here even a man of sinful deeds, on remembering the Ganges even at a dis tance of thousands of yojanas, attains the highest goal. A person is delivered from sin by uttering the name (of the Ganges), on seeing it a person sees happiness; by bathing in the Ganges and drinking its water he purifies his family up to the seventh ancestor'. It is stated in the Kāśikhanda that on the banks of the glorious Ganges all times are auspicious as well as all countries, and all men are fit for receiving gifts. 

In the Varahapurana (chap. 82) the name 'Ganga' is deri ved as 'gām gatā' (that has gone to the earth). The Padma purāṇa (Srstikhanda 60. 64-65) specifies the mūlamantra about the Ganges as follows : 'Om namo Gangayai, visvarupinyai nārāyaṇyai namo namah'. Koth The Padmapurana (srsti 60.35) holds that Visnu repre sents all the gods and the Ganges represents Visnu. It eulo gises the Ganges as follows: Sons abandon their fathers, wives their husbands, friends and relatives abandon a friend or a rela tive if any one of these is adulterous, or patita, or wicked or becomes a cāndāla or kills his guru, or is full of all kinds of sins and hatreds; but the Ganges does not forsake such 

persons 1336 

The extent of the holy region of the Ganges is laid down in some purāņas. The Nāradiya 1337 states: the region

The limits of the kṣetra are of the extent of one yojana between both the banks' i. e. the kṣetra extends for two krosas from each bank. The general rule is stated by Yama that forests, mountains, holy rivers and tirthas are without an owner; these cannot be possessed (by a person as owner). The Brahmapurāṇa 1338 says that measur ing from the flowing waters for a distance of four hastas, God Nārāyaṇa is the Lord (or owner) and no one should accept a gift in that strip even if he be on the point of death. A differ ence is made between the garbha (the inner circle) of the Gangākṣetra, the tīra and the kṣetra. "Garbha' extends up to that portion of the river stream which is reached on the 14th of the dark half of Bhadrapada; beyond that is the tira (bank). which extends upto 150 hastas from garbha and kṣetra extends up to two krosas from each bank. 

Let us suppose that the pilgrim has come to the Ganges. Then the question is, how is he to proceed about a bath in the Ganges. Many of the digests contain several alternate forms of the sankalpa to be made at the time of Gangā-snāna. For example, the Prāyaścittatattva (pp. 497-498) contains a very elaborate sankalpa. A simple one is quoted below from the Gangāvākyāvali.1339 The mode of bathing prescribed in the

Procedure of bath in the Ganges Matsyapurāņa 102 is common to people of all varṇas and students of all the different recensions of the Veda. The Matsyapurāņa, chap. 102, which contains one of the earliest procedure of a reli gious bath, and which has been taken over by several digests such as the Gangāvākyāvali (pp. 148–152) is summarised here. Cleanliness (of the body) and clean thoughts do not exist without a bath; therefore bathing is first prescribed for making the mind pure. One may bathe with water drawn (in a vessel from a well or stream) or with water not so drawn. A wise man should fix upon a holy spot after repeating the funda mental mantra 'namo Nārāyaṇāya' (reverent bow to Nārāyaṇa). A man holding darbha grass in his hand and being clean and pure should perform ācamana (ceremonial sipping of water). He should select a spot four hastas square on all sides and invoke the Ganges (to come or be present there) with the following mantras 'you are sprung from the foot of Viṣņu, you are a devotee of Viṣņu, you worship Viṣnu; therefore save us from sins committed from birth to death. Vāyu declared that there are three and a half crores (35 millions) of holy places in heaven, on the earth and in mid air; all these, O Ganges (daughter of Jahnu), belong to you. Your name among the gods is Nandini (the joy-giving) and also Nalini and there are other names of yours viz. Dakṣā, Prthvi, Vihagā, Visva kāyā, Amộtā, Sivā, Vidyādhari, Supraśāntā, Viśva-prasādini, Kṣemā, Jāhnavi, śāntā, śāntipradāyinī. 1339a One should utter these holy names at the time of bathing; then the Ganges flowing in the three worlds would be near (even if a man bath ed at home). He should, after folding his hands, cast on his head thrice, four times, five times or seven times water on which he has muttered the mantras seven times. After having invoked the clay (in the river bed) with the mantras "O earth! Oh clay! you are crossed over by horses and chariots, by Viṣnu, remove my sin which I may have committed by my evil deeds; you were brought up (from the depths of the sea) by the Boar incarnation of Krona with his hundred hands. O clayl you are given (to the world) by Brahmā and you had mantras repeated over you by Kāśyapa. Occupying my limbs may you drive away all my sin! Oh clay! Give us

prosperity; everything is centered in you; a bow to you, that are virtuous and the source of all worlds'. Having thus bathed and having sipped water (ācamana) according to the procedure prescribed, he should get out of the Ganges and should put on two white and pure garments. Then he should perform tarpana 1340 for the satisfaction of the three worlds. (He should say) 'This water is being offered by me for satiating gods, yaksas, nāgas, gandharvas, apsarases, asuras, cruel snakes, eagles, trees, jackals, birds, creatures that sustain themselves on air and water or that move in the sky, all beings that are without support and those that are devoted to the dictates of dharma'.

The first has to be performed every day by a twice-born person (who has finished his studies) for the gods, sages and pitrs in that order. The 2nd is performed as an anga of snāna. Para a TATTCH Grau farnagai avui a liga Jaaaall g rup q. by THT p 162. agor is an anga of bath as well as of brahma-yajña. Tarpana has been described at great length in H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 668-669 and pp. 689-695. Therefore it is not necessary to make any lengthy remarks on tarpana here. A few matters that deserve attention are mentioned, One rule is that one has to perform tarpana according to the provisions of his own recension of the Veda. The persons to whom water is to be offered and the manner in which it is to be offered are set out on p. 692 of vol. II of H. of Dh. Another rule is that tarpana has to be done (even if the day is not auspicious) at a tirtha, in Gayā, in pitrpaksa (i. e. the dark half of Bhādrapada) with water mixed with sesame 'तीर्थे तिथिप्रवेशे (तिथिविशेषे?) च गयायां प्रेतपक्षके। निषिद्धपि दिने कुर्यात्तर्पणं Tadla n. A widow also has to perform tarpana for her husband and his relatives at a sacred place. An ascetic (sannyāsin) has not to do it. A person whose father is living has not to perform tarpana, but acc. to Viṣnupurana he offers three handfuls to gods, three to the sages and one to Prajāpati (in the form devās-trpyantām'). Another rule is the one makes an offering in sraddba or into fire with one hand only (the right hand) but in tarpana water is poured into the stream in which one is bathing or on land with both hands.

Having thus bowed to the Sun and having circumambulated thrice (the lotus drawn for representing the sun) and touching a brāhmana, gold and a cow, the person (bather) should go to a temple of Visnu (or to his own house, according to another reading). 1344 

It may be noted that the verses of the Matsyapurāņa (102.2-31) summarised above occur (with slight variations of a word here and there) in Padma (Pātāla-khanda 89. 12-42) and Srsti-khanda, chap. 20. 145-176. 

The Sm, C. and Raghunandana in his Prayascittatattva (p. 502 ) lay down two mantras to be recited at the time of taking a bath in the Ganges 1345 'O Ganges, daughter of Jahnu! That flowest in three worlds, that art sprung from the lotus-like feet of Visnu, that are far-famed as devoted to (the spread of) dharma, remove my sin; O divine mother, O Bhagirathi! purify with your immortal waters me who am full of faith and devotion'. The mantra to be repeated at the time of the bath at the place where the Ganges falls into the ocean according to the same two works is "O god that art the lord of rivers ! O goddess that art the best among rivers ! Having bathed at the confluence of both I shall cast off my sins". 

On pp. 243-244 above it has been stated that the Visnu Dh. S, and other works recommend the casting of the ashes or charred bones of a cremated body in the Ganges at Prayaga, Kāśi or other holy place and the rites accompanying the cast ing of ashes have been there set out.

Casting ashes in the Ganges 

595 

ashes in the Ganges occurs in several works. The Agnipurāṇa observes the deceased man benefits if his bones are thrown into the Ganges; a man stays in heaven as long as (even a particle of) his bone remains in the waters of the Ganges. No rites for the dead are performed for those who commit suicide or who are patita; but even in their case the fall of their bones in Ganges water is beneficial to them.' The Tir, C. and Tir. Pr. quote two verses and a half from the Brahma purāṇa 1347 which set out a briefer rite of throwing ashes than the one in the Nirnayasindhu. The verses mean:"The man carrying the ashes should take a bath, sprinkle pañcagavya over the ashes, should place on them a piece of gold, honey, ghee and sesame; then he should deposit them in an earthen vessel; he should then look in the southern direction, say "salutation to Dharma,' enter the waters (of the Ganges), utter, may he (Dharma or Viṣnu?) be pleased with me and then cast the ashes in the water; then he should bathe in the river, come out of it, cast a look at the Sun and then give a present (daksinā) to a brāhmaṇa; if he does so, then the state of the deceased person will be like Indra.' Vide Skanda, Kāšī-khanda 30. 42-46 where a little more elaborate procedure is prescribed. The importance of casting ashes in the Ganges probably owes its origin to the story of king Sagara's sons who were reduced to ashes by the wrath of the sage Kapila and who were saved by the ashes being washed in the waters of the Ganges brought down from heaven by Bhagiratha. Vide Vanaparya chap. 107 109, Visnupurāņa II. 8-10 for the story. The Nāradiya makes not only the throwing of calcined bones a source of benefit to the departed but even his nails and hair when cast in the Ganges confer the same benefit. It is stated in the Kāśikhanda that those who, while standing on the banks of the Ganges, praise another tirtha or do not think very highly of the Ganges go to hell.1347a The Kāśikhanda further provides that there is special and

The three great tirthas of Prayāga, Kāśi and Gayā are referred to as Tristhali and the great scholar, Nārāyaṇabhatta (born in 1513 A, D.), wrote (about 1580 A, D.) in Benares a famous work called Tristhalīsetu (a bridge to the Tristhali) wherein he gives a thorough and exhaustive treatment of the pilgrimage to these three holy places 1348a alone. Prayāga is assigned pp. 1-72, Kāsi pp. 72-316 and Gayā pp. 316-379 (of the Anandāśrama edition). Following with all humility the footsteps of such an illustrious and venerable scholar I shall deal with the three tirthas in the same order. 

PRAYAGA 

One of the most ancient reference to the greatness of the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamunā occurs in a khila 1349 verse which is usually placed in Rg. X. 75 and may be rendered as follows: "Those who take a bath at the place where the

The त्रिस्थली. p.3 says it is a supplementary sruti text of the Asvalayana school, while the Tir. C. p. 47 quotes it as a verse of the Rgveda. It is quite possible to hold that the verse does not encourage religious suicide but only makes this distinction that by a bath only once a man goes to heaven and that if he dies at Prayaga he attains moksa even without correct metaphysical knowledge.

two rivers, white and dark, meet together, rise up (fly up) to heaven; those determined men who abandon their body there (i. e, commit suicide by drowning themselves) secure immor tality (or moksa)". This must have been a comparatively early verse. The Skandapurāṇa referes to it as śruti. The greatness of Prayāga is dwelt upon in the Mahābhārata (Vana parva 85. 69-97, 87. 18-20, Anušāsana 25. 36-38) 1350 and in many purāṇas such as the Matsya (chapters 103-112, in all 260 verses), Kurma I. 36-39 (verses 121), Padma (I. chap. 40-49), Skanda, Kasi-Khanda, chap. 7. 45-65). Only a few out of the hundreds of verses on Prayāga can be cited here by way of sample. One remarkable fact is that the Rāmāyana does not say much about Prayāga. The confluence of the two rivers is no doubt referred to (Rām. II. 54.6) but from the des cription it appears that there was a forest at what is now Prayāga. Prayāga is called Tirtharaja (the prince among tirthas) in the Matsya 109. 15, Skanda (Kāśi 7. 45), Padma VI. 23. 27-35 (where the refrain at the end of each verse is 'sa tirtharājo jayati prayāgah) and elsewhere. The legend runs that Prajapati or Pitamaha (Brahma) performed a sacrifice here and Prayāga is the middle one of the vedis of Brahmā, the others being Kuruksetra in the north (uttaravedi) and Gaya in the east. It is believed that three rivers meet at Prayāga viz, Ganga, Yamunā and Sarasvati (underground between the two). It is said in the Matsya 1351, Kūrma and other Purānas that at the very sight of Prayāga, even by taking its name or by applying its clay to one's body a man becomes free from sin. The Kūrmapurāņa 1352 proclaims "it is the sacred spot of Prajāpati; those who bathe here go to heaven and those who die here are not born again.” That sacred spot is known as tirtharāja ; it is dear to Keśava. The same is known as Triveni.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

The word Prayāga is employed in the neuter when connect ed with such words as tirtha or kṣetra, as in Matsya (111. 14 prajāpater-idam kṣetram prayāgam-iti viśrutam), but when employed along with words (in the masculine gender) such as tirtharāja, it takes the masculine gender. 

The word Prayaga is derived in various ways. The Vana parva 1353 appears to suggest that the word Prayāga is derived from the root 'yaj when it says 'Brahmā who is the soul of all beings performed formerly a sacrifice here; therefore it became known as Prayāga'. In the Skanda 1354 purāṇa also it appears to be explained by taking the two parts pra and yāga separate ly. "It is mentioned as Prayāga because it is superior to all sacrifices: Prayāga was the name given to it by the gods Hari. Hara and others seeing that it is superior to all sacrifices though the latter be enriched with fees and the like." The Matsyapurāņa 1355 appears to lay emphasis on the part 'pra' when it says 'on account of its efficacy (or power) as compared with all other tirthas it prevails (or is useful) far more'. The Brahmapurāṇa 1356 affirms “It is called prayāga on account of its eminence and it has the word 'rāja' (in Tirtharāja) applied to it on account of its being the chief". 

We must distinguish between Prayāga-mandala, Prayāga and Venī or Triveni, each subsequent one being smaller and holier than each preceding one. The Matsya 1357 states that the sphere of Prayaga is five yojanas in circumference and that the moment a man enters inside this strip of land, there is an Aśva medha at every step. This has been explained by the Tristhali setu (p. 15) as follows: Regarding Brahmayūpa (the sacrificial post of Brahmā) as the spike or peg, if one measures with a rope one and one half yojana long all round, that would be the

Boundaries and extent of Prayaga 

599 

Prayagamandala of five yojanas in circumference. The bound aries of Prayāga itself are defined by Vanaparva,1358 the Matsya purāņa (104.5 and 106. 30) and others. 'Prayāga extends from Pratisthāna up to the pool of Vāsuki and upto the two nāgas Kambala and Aśvatara and the nāga Bahumülaka; this is known in the three worlds as the sacred spot of Prajāpati' (Matsya 104.5), while Matsya 106. 30 provides that to the east of the Ganges is the Samudraküpa, which is the same as Prati sthāna. This is explained by the Tristhalisetu as follows: the eastern boundary is the küpa called Pratisthāna 1359, the nor thern one is the Vasuki pool, the western limit is formed by Kambala and Aśvatara; the southern boundary is Bahumülaka. This would be a four-cornered space which is included within Prayāga-mandala. According to the Matsyapurāṇa as quoted by the Kalpataru on tirtha p. 143 the two Nāgas are on the south bank of Yamunā while the printed text has 'vipule Yamunātate' (106, 27) 1350. The printed text of Padma I. 43. 27 supports the Kalpataru reading ('Yamunā-daksine tate). Veni-kṣetra is within the limits of Prayāga itself and is twenty bow lengths in extent, as stated in the Padma. There are three kūpas viz. Prayāga, Pratisthāna and Alarkapura, The Matsya and Agni say 'there are three fire kundas and the Ganges flows in their midst'. It should be noted that except where special reference is made in the Purānas to the sub tirthas, the reference to a bath at Prayāga in general means bath in the Veni i. e, the confluence of the two rivers, as e g in Vanaparva 85.81 and 85 and Matsya 104.16-17, 1361

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. The Vanaparva 1362 and some of the Purānas represent that the country between the Ganges and the Yamunā is (like) the hips and loins of the earth (i. e. it is the most prosperous and plentiful part of the earth) and that Prayāga is like the inmost part of the hips. 

The Narasimha-purāṇa says that Visnu is in the form of Yogamūrti in Prayāga (65.17). It is said in the Matsya purana 1363 (111. 4-10 ) that when Rudra dissolves the world at the end of the Kalpa, the holy place of Prayāga is not destroyed, that Brahmā, Visnu and Maheśvara (Siva) stay in Prayāga, that to the north of Pratisthāna Brahmā stays in it under guise, that Visnu stays there as Veņi-Madhava, that Siva stays there as the Vata (banyan tree) and that therefore the gods with the Gan dharvas, the Siddhas and great sages always protect the sphere (mandala) of Prayāga by guarding it against evil actions. The Matsyapurāṇa, therefore, recommends that a pilgrim should go to Prayāga which is protected by all the gods, stay there for a month, avoid sexual intercourse, worship gods and pitrs and thereby secure his desired objects (104.18). The same Purāņa highly eulogises the gift at Prayāga of a kapilā cow properly decked (105, 16-22) with clothes, ornaments and jewels. The Padmapurana (Adi. 42.17-24) has the same verses as the Matsya on this subject. Similarly, the marriage of a daughter in the ārsa form at Prayaga is highly spoken of in Matsya (106. 8-9). The Matsya (105. 13-14 and 106. 10) says generally that if a man makes a gift of a cow, of gold, of precious stones, of pearls and of other things that he owns his pilgrimage becomes fruit ful (saphala) and he collects religious merit (punya) and that when a man makes gifts according to his ability and wealth, the fruit of his pilgrimage increases and he remains in heaven

Rewards of gifts at Prayāga 

601 

Kuruksetra, Prayaga, at the mouth of the Ganges where it falls into the sea, on the Ganges, at Puskara, at Setubandha, at Gangādvāra and in Naimisa tends to confer inexhaustible rewards. In the Vanaparva 1365 it is stated that this sacrificial ground (of Brahmā) is honoured even by the gods, that even a small thing donated here assumes greatness (i. e. produces the rewards of large gifts). 

The confluence of the three rivers came to be associated with omkāra, 1366 the mystic syllable that stands for Brahma. It is said in a purāṇa passage (probably Brahmapurāņa) that the three parts of om (a um) respectively are Sarasvati, Yamunā and Gangā and that the waters of three rivers represent Pradyumna, Aniruddha and Sankarṣaņa Hari. 18 It may be noted that, in spite of the fact that the Matsya, Kūrma (I. 36-39), Padma (Ādi. chapters 41-49), Agni 111 and other Purāṇas contain several hundred verses on Prayāga, the Kalpataru (on tirtha), the earliest extant digest on tirthas, quotes only the Matsya (104, 1-13 and 16-20, 105. 1-22, 106. 1-48, 107.2–21, 108. 3-5, 8-17 and 23-34, 109. 10-12, 110.1-11, 111. 8-11, in all about 151 Verses) and Vanaparva chap. 85. 79-87 and 97 and does not add a single word of explanation or discussion. But the other digests profusely quoting mostly from Purāņas discuss at some length several topics and a few words must be devoted to some of those topics. 

One such topic is tonsure at Prayāga. It is stated by the Gangāvākyāvali (p. 298) and the Tir. Pr. (p. 335) that, though the author of the Kalpataru says nothing about tonsure at Prayāga, yet as ģistas (respectable and learned people) and the writers of digests accept it as necessary, certain autho rities would be set out. The two verses quoted by most 13664 writers are one should tonsure the head at Prayāga, offer pindas at Gayā, make gifts in Kuruksetra and should commit

(religious) suicide at Benares. What is the use (or necessity) of pinda offerings at Gayā or death in Kāśi, 'or gifts at Kuruk setra, if one has tonsured one's head at Prayāga?". Elaborate discussions are held by all these works about the exact inten tion of the verses, about the application of the maxim of rātrisattra 1367 to them and about the results derived from ton sure. They have to be passed over here from considerations of space. The Tristhali-setu (p. 17) holds that the verse only prai ses the rite of tonsure at Prayāga and the fruit thereof is simply the removal of sin. The Tri. S. refutes (p. 17) the application of rātrisattra-nyāya to these verses, while Tir. C. (p. 32) applies it. Some of the conclusions drawn by the Tri. S. are that in one and the same yātrā at Prayāga (even if a man stays there for some days) .ceremonial tonsure takes place only once, that widows have to tonsure their heads, that in the case of women whose husbands are living only two or three finger-breadths of tresses are to be cut and offered at the Triveni, that even 1367a boys whose upanayana has not been performed have to undergo tonsure provided the cūņā rite has already been performed. The Tristhalisetu (p. 22) notes that certain traditionalists, 1368

The question arises whether in the absence of an express reward, heaven should be under stood as the reward (because as explained in Jai. IV. 3. 15-16 svarga is the 

ard of all sacrifices for which no express reward is mentioned) or whether gragt (stable position ) which occurs in the above arthavāda passage should be held to be the reward of : 11HET. The reply is that here the reward is grant and not f i, e, though there is no express mention of the reward in the passage about ratrisattra, the arthavada passage should be construed as laying down the reward. In the two verses, there is a vidhi in the words प्रयागे वपनं कुर्यात् and the second verse is an अर्थवाद. The question is what reward is promised in it.

Tonsure of women at Prayāga 

603 

relying on passages that aver that all sins cling to the roots of a person's hair, say that cutting two or three tresses would be merely kartana and not vapana (tonsure), that even women whose husbands are alive must shave themselves at Prayāga, that such women should make a braid of all their hair, should deck the braid with saffron and other auspicious materials, bow to their husbands and with the husband's permission have the head tonsured, that then they should place the cut hair in their joined hands, place thereon a golden or silver veni and pearls and coral and should cast all these into the confluence (Veni) of the Ganges and Jumnā after repeating the mantra ‘May all my sins be destroyed by this offering of my braided hair into the Veņi! may my blessedness (the auspicious state of wifehood) always increase in the lives to come.' The Tri. S. states that women do not tonsure their head at any tirtha except at Prayāga and the only reason for this is that it is the practice of sistas. Vide above pp. 122-124 for tonsure as expiation for sins. The Nāradiya (Uttara) 63. 106 provides the same rule as Parāśara (in note 278 above) for women. The Prāyascittatattva of Raghunandana prescribes the complete tonsure of the head for women at Prayāga. 

It appears probable that the provision for the casting of veņi (braided hair) on the part of women whose husbands were alive was suggested by the word Venī applied to the confluence of the two rivers, where the river Ganges appears to make a bend or curve for some distance 1369 

One important question that very much exercised the minds of ancient and medieval Indian writers was whether and when suicide, particularly at sacred spots like the confluence of the Ganges and Jumnā or at the foot of the Akṣaya Vata at Prayāga, would involve no sin 1370 This matter has already been

dealt with at length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 924-928 and vol. TII. pp. 939, 948-949. Only a brief treatment by way of a summary of the pages and a few notes will be added here. The general sentiment of Dharmaśāstra works is to condemn suicide or an attempt to commit suicide as a great sin (vide H. of Dh, vol. II. page 924 for texts). The Ap. Dh. S. (I. 10. 28. 15-17) mentions the view of Hārīta which condemns suicide even as prāya Ścitta for committing a mahāpātaka (like incest) and puts kill ing another or killing oneself on the same footing. Manu V. 89 and Yāj. III. 154 condemn suicide by denying after-death rites to those who commit it, but Manu allowed suicide in various ways as prāyaścitta for mahāpātakas (vide Manu XI. 73, 90-91, 103-104). But exceptions to the condemnation of suicide are found in the smrtis, epics and purāņas. They may be grouped under several heads. (1) Suicide as an exception in various ways by those guilty of mahāpātakas (viz, brāhmana murder, drinking of surā, theft of brāhmaṇa's gold and incest); vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 924–925 for smrti and other texts. (2) Starting on the Great Journey (mahāprasthāna-gamana or mahāpathayātrā) by a forest hermit (Manu VI, 31, Yāj. III. 55) suffering from incurable diseases and unable to perform the duties of his order. (3) An old man or one who cannot observe the rules of bodily purification or who is so ill as to be beyond medical skill may kill himself by throwing himself from a precipice or by fire or by drowning or fasting or start on the Great Journey into the Himālaya or by jumping from the bran ches of the Vata tree at Prayāga (Apararka p. 877 quoting Adi-purāņa and Atri-smrti verses 218-219 q. by Medhātithi on Manu V. 88 and Mit. on Yāj. III. 6). (4) Even a house holder, otherwise all right, may resort to suicide by the means stated (in No. 3) if his life's work is done, if he has no desire for the pleasures of the world and does not desire to live, or if he is a Vedāntin1371 and convinced of the ephemeral nature of life and may kill himself by fast in Himālaya. (5) Religious suicide 

· was allowed at the confluence of the two great rivers Gangā and Yamunā, at the Vata there and at some other tirthas. (6) A wife dying by sahagamana or anumarana. As to Sati, the Nāradiya (pārvārdha 7. 52-53) provides that a woman should not burn herself on the funeral pyre of her husband if she has alus

Not only did common men believe in the pro. mise of the Purāņas that those who killed themselves at Prayaga (at the sangama or near Vata) secured mokṣa ( freedom from the everlasting cycle of births and deaths ) which was the highest of the four puruṣārathas (goals of human existence ), but even great poets like Kālidāsa held the view that, though moksa or kaivalya or apavarga requires correct knowledge and realisation of the Supreme Spirit according to the Vedānta, Sānkhya and Nyāya systems, death at the sacred sangama led to mokṣa even without 

tattvajñāna.' In H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 925-927, historical ex amples of kings such as Yasah-karnadeva, Candella Dhangadev and Cālukya Somešvara committing suicide at Prayāga or the Tungabhadrā have been given. The king Kumāragupta of Magadha is said to have entered the fire of dry cow-dung cakes. This is in accordance with the prescriptions in the Matsya purāṇa 107. 9-10 (Padma, Adi-khanda 44.3) which states 1372 "the man who, suffering from no diseases, having no deficiency as to his limbs and being in full possession of his five senses, encompasses (his death) in cowdung fire remains honoured in heaven for as many years as there are pores on the whole of his body.' 1373 The Rājatarangiņi VI. 14 refers to officers entrusted with the duty of supervising suicide by fast (prāyopaveśa). . 1372.

(1) starving; (2) covering himself with cowdung and setting iton fire and consuming himself therein; (3) burying himself in snowu ti to plunge into water at the Gangasagara-sangama, enumerate one's sins and pray till alligators come and devour the man; (5) cut his throat Allahabad at the confluence of the Ganges and the Tumnā.

The important verse on which reliance is placed for sanctioning religious suicide at Prayāga may be translated 1374 as follows: 'You should not set aside (pass over) your wish about dying at Prayāga on account of the words of the Veda or the words of the people. The words of the Veda1375 are Vāj. S. 40. 3 (=Išāvāsyopaniṣad 3) which literally translated means 'there are worlds of Asuras enveloped in blinding darkness; those who have killed themselves repair after death to those worlds.' This verse does not in the context appear to refer to a person committing suicide, but rather to a person who kills his soul by remaining in ignorance of the true Self. But even learned writers and poets took it to refer to suicide ( vide Uttara rāmacarita, Act IV after verse 3). Another passage of the Veda on which reliance may be placed is the one in the Satapatha Brahmana X.2.6. 7 'one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass away before the full extent of life, for it (such. shortening of full life) does not make for the (heavenly) world'. By the words of the people' are meant smrti passages con demning suicide such as Gaut. 14. 12, Vas.1375a 23. 14-15, Manu V. 88 (which says that no water is to be offered to those who kill themselves), Visnu Dh. S. 2.2.56 (atmatyaginah patitas-ca. nasaucodakabhajah).oneimit

Suicide at Prayāga There is no doubt that some of the smrtis, the Maha bhārata 1376 itself and some puranas do recommend (or at least do not condemn) suicide in certain circumstances. A few purāṇa passages may be quoted here. Two verses of the Kūrma state 'That goal (or state), which a wise man that is devoted to Yoga and that has become an ascetic (or has forsaken "all actions) reaches, is secured by him who gives up life at the confluence of the Ganga and Yamunā. Whoever dies in the Gangā whether wilfully or unintentionally is born after death in heaven and does not see hell'.1377 The Kürma is quite clear 

Moksa may be secured or not after a thousand births else where but in Benarés moksa can be secured in a single birth' (1. 32. 22). The Padma 1378 is quite emphatic "a man who, knowingly or unknowingly, wilfully or unintentionally, dies in the Ganges secures on death heaven and mokṣa'. A verse of the Skanda asserts "He who abandons his life in this sacred place in some way or other does not incur the sin of suicide but secures his desired objects.' The Kūrma (1. 38. 3-12) refers to four modes of suicide and promises residence in heaven and various other rewards for thousands of years, viz. by (1) burn ing oneself in the slow fire of dry cowdung cakes, (2) by enter ing the water at the confluence of Gangā and Yamunā, (3) by hanging with head down in the stream and feet up and drinking

the waters of the Ganges, (4) by cutting off his own flesh and giving it as food to birds. The famous Chinese traveller Hiouen Thgang (about 629-645 A. D.) clearly refers to this practice of religious suicide (vide Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Wes tern world,' vol. I. pp. 232–234). The Kalpataru on Tirtha (composed about 1110-1120 A, D.) devotes a special section to Mahāpathayātrā (pp. 258–265). Gradually, the idea of secur ing heaven and moksa by committing suicide at Prayāga or Benares appears to have spread to other tirthas. Vanaparva 1379 speaks of suicide at Pșthūdaka (Pehova in the Karnal district of Punjab, 14 miles from Thanesar). The Brahmapurāņa 1380 calls upon dvijas who are intent on securing mokṣa to commit suicide at Purusottama-kṣetra. The Lingapurāṇa 1381 says 'if a brāhmaṇa kills himself on Śrīśaila he destroys his sins and attains mokṣa as at Avimukta (Benares); there is no doubt about this'. The Padma promises 1382 a similar reward for suicide by fire or by fast at the confluence of Narmada and Kāverī (a small river, not the great South Indian river). dod 

Gradually there was a revulsion of feeling against suicide at Prayāga or Kasi or starting on the Great Journey. Among the actions forbidden in the Kali age are included 'starting on the Great Journey' and 'suicide of old people jumping from a precipice or by fire' (vide H. of Dh, vol. III, pp. 939, 958-59). Some of the later medieval writers try very hard to combat the view that religious suicide is permitted 1383 Nilakantha, the commentator of the Mahābhārata, holds that Vanaparva 85. 83 (na vedavacanāt &c.) refers to natural death at Prayāga and not to wilful death and that the Khila verse ("Sitāsite' quoted above on p. 596) has the same meaning. Then he propounds two alternative interpretations of Vanaparva 85.

83, viz. that this passage allows those who are suffering from an incurable disease to commit suicide at Prayāga instead of dying by falling from a precipice and the like or that this verse does not apply to brāhmaṇas but only to the other three varņas. 1384 

Both the Gangāvākyāvali (pp. 304–310) and the Tīr, C. (pp. 47-52) hold that all varnas have the authority to resort to suicide at Prayaga. The Tir. Pr. holds a long, learned and highly polemic discussion on the subject of religious suicide at Prayaga (pp.346-355). Its own view appears to be that a brāhmana should not commit this suicide at Prayaga on account of the prohibition contained in Kalivarjya verses and that members of the other varnas may do so. The Tristhalisetu algo enters upon a long discussion (pp. 47-55) and its conclu sions are that in suicide at Prayāga for the attainment of moksa or other rewards (such as heaven) there is no sin, that this suicide at Prayāga is not forbidden 1384a to brāhmanas as some think (since Agni 111. 8 reads 'na vedavacanād vipra'), that persons whether seriously ill or in good health 1385 may resort to suicide at Prayāga, that no one has authority to commit suicide at Prayāga after abandoning to their fate one's old parents, young wife and children that require support, nor should a woman who is pregnant or who has young children or who has no permission from her husband, commit suicide at Prayaga.1386 It is refreshing to find Narayanabhatta, perhaps

the most learned and renowned Pandit of his age steeped in all the lore of ancient India, make, in spite of the overwhelming weight of śāstric authority in favour of suicide at Prayāga, exceptions that surely appeal to reason, sentiment and common. sense.1387 Nārāyanabhatta probably followed traditions several hundred years older than his times. Alberuni in his work on India composed about 1030 A. D. says about religious suicide that it was resorted to by those who are tired of life, who are distressed over some incurable disease, some irremovable bodily defect or old age or infirmity. This however no man of distinction does, but only vaiśyas and südras. Burning oneself is forbidden to brāhmaṇas and ksatriyas by a special law. Therefore these if they want to kill themselves do so at the time of an eclipse in some other manner or they hire somebody to drown them in the Ganges.' (tr. by Sachau, vol. II, p. 170). The Tri. S. S. provides that a man desirous of committing religious suicide at Prayāga should first perform a prāyaścitta,

should perform his own grāddha upto the offering of pinda if he has no relative entitled to perform it, should fast that day, should make a sankalpa next day preceded by a writing (to inform people of his desire to die in that way) and enter the holy waters contemplating on Viṣnu. On his death, his relatives have to observe āśauca only for three days and not for ten) and on the 4th day the śrāddhas of the 11th day are to be performed for him.1388 Jom The psychological background behind the religious suicide at Prayāga and other places is not difficult to realise. Centuries of philosophical thought had made a very deep impression on the minds of all people that the soul has to subniit to a never-ending cycle of births and deaths. Ancient scriptures had offered a release in two ways viz. by tattvajñāna and by suicide at a tirtha. Death had no great terror for the pilgrim who submitted to various inconveniences and priva tions ungrudgingly. If one is determined to put an end to samsāra by taking one's life, what nobler environment could have been imagined or indicated than at Prayāga, where two mighty rivers flowing from the sacred Himalaya unite and carry on unceasingly their work of fertilizing the land and bringing prosperity and solace to millions of needy and anxious people ? 

While on this topic of religious suicide, it would not be out of place to briefly refer to the discussion in the digests about the meaning of the statement in the purāṇas that those who die at Prayaga are not born again (e. g. Matsya 180.71 and 74). The answer is foreshadowed in the Matsyapurāņa itself (182. 22-25) which 1389 says: At the time of death, when the vital

parts of the human body are being shattered, memory must fail a human being that is about to be pushed on (to another body) by the vital breath (when it leaves the mortal coil). But at the time of death in Avimukta (Vārāṇasī) Lord (Śiva) himself whispers (higher knowledge in the ears of his devotees that are about to be pushed into new bodies) by (accumulations of their actions). A man dying near Manikarnikā pool reaches the desired goal; he being guided by the Lord reaches the goal which is difficult of attainment by those whose minds are not pure.' In the Kāśikhapda it is expressly stated that mokṣa does not directly result in these cities (viz. Kaśī &c.). But in spite of these warnings the popular belief fostered by the literal mean ing of hundreds of Purāņa passages is that moksa results from dying at Prayāga or in Kāśiksetra. 

The practice of religious suicide has a very respectable antiquity. In the 4th century B. C. Kalanos, the Indian Gymnosophist from Taxila who had accompanied Alexander from India, burnt himself alive on a funeral pyre at Sousa, when being over 70 years old, he was afflicted with a malady that made life more and more burdensome. Vide J. W. McCrindle's 'Invasion of India by Alexander the Great' (New Edition 1896) pp. 46, 301, 386-392. Strabo informs us of a gymnosophist from India named Zarmanochegas of Broach who accompanied an embassy to Augustus Caesar at Athens and consigned himself to flames (vide 'Invasion of India by Alexander' p. 389). Hiouen Thsang (Beal's 'Buddhist Records of the Western World' vol. I. pp. 232-234) refers to suicide at Prayāga. The Jains, while on the one hand they laid the greatest emphasis on 'ahimsā' (non-injury), encouraged reli gious suicide (called 'Sallekhana') in certain cases 1390. 

Some of the works, viz. the Kasimrti-mokṣa-vicāra of Sureśvara (pp. 2-9), the Tristhalisetu (pp. 50-55) and the Tirthaprakāśa (pp. 313-318) discuss at some length how mere death (either involuntary or voluntary) in Vārānasi or Prayaga would lead to mokṣa. Considerations of space prevent a complete statement of their views. Their arguments are briefly as follows:Karma is of three kinds, viz. sancita (col lected in former births), prārabdha (that has begun to

operate by giving the soul the present body) and kriyamana (to be done in this body and in future). The Upaniṣads and the Gita,1391 declare that, just as waters do not stick to a lotus leaf, so evil deeds do not cling to a man who knows this (knowledge of brahma), that the fire of knowledge reduces to ashes all karma and that mokṣa results from the realization of the Supreme Spirit (Vedānta-sūtra IV. 1. 13). From this it follows that a man who has realized the Highest Reality will not be affected by the acts done by him after realiza tion and his accumulated actions (sañcita) will be des troyed by that realization. The present body in which the soul realizes brahma was due to that part of his karma which had begun to operate. When the present body perishes in the case of a man who has realized brahma he attains final release, since no actions remain for producing effects. To the man who dies a natural death in Benares is given at the time of death the Taraka (saving) mantra.i-The Matsyapurana says:1392 those who enter fire according to the rules in Avimukta (i.e. Benares) enter the mouth of Siva and so also those determined devotees of Siva who die by fast in Benares do not return (to this world) even after millions of kalpas. Therefore all those who die in any way at 1393 Benares receive Grace from Siva after their death. That leads to tattvajñāna (correct spiritual knowledge) which leads to moksa. In rare passages it is expressly stated that mokṣa cannot 1394 be immediately secured

(by dying) in these cities. The Tāraka-mantra is variously explained. According to Sureśvara, Tāraka-mantra is the mystic syllable om which is a symbol of brahma as stated in the Tai. Up. (I. 1.8 Om-iti brahma) and the Gītā (8. 13 Om ityekākṣaram brahma). The Tri. S. gives another explanation besides this. According to Rāmatāpaniya Upaniṣad and 1395 the Padmapurāṇa the mantra is 'sri-Rama-Rāma-Rāmeti.' 

There are several sub-tirthas that fall under Prayaga. The most important of them is the famous Vata (banyan tree) called Akṣaya-Vata (the imperishable Vata). The Agni (111. 13) states 'if a man dies at the foot of the Vata and in the Sangama he goes to the city of Viṣnu'. Special reference is made to abandoning one's life at the foot of the Vața. The Kūrma1396 says 'He, who abandons life at the foot of the Vata, passes beyond heavenly worlds and goes to the world of Rudra'. The following are the sub tirthas of Prayāga and only references are given to the works in which they are described : (1) the two Nāgas called Kambala and Aśvatara which according to some are on the spacious (vipula) bank of the Jumnā and according to others on the southern bank of the Jumnā (Vanaparva 85.77, Matsya 106. 27, Padma, Adi 39. 69, Agni 111.5, Kūrma I. 37. 19), (2) Pratisthāna on the eastern side of the Ganges, being the same as the Sāmudra-küpa (Vana parva 85.77, Matsya 106. 30, Kūrma I. 37.22, Padma, Adi. 43, 30; Vanaparva 85.114 appears to suggest that Pratisthāna is another name of Prayāga; (3) Sandhyāvata (Matsya 106.43, Kūrma I. 37.28, Agni 111. 13); (4) Hamsaprapatana to the north of Pratisthāna and to the east of the Ganges (Matsya 106.32, Kūrma I. 37, 24, Agni 111.10, Padma, Ādi 39.80 and 43.32; (5) Koțitirtha (Matsya 106. 44, Kūrma I. 37.29, Agni 111. 14, Padma, Adi 43.44; (6) Bhogavati, the Vedi of Prajāpati to the north of Vāsuki (Vanaparva 85.77, Matsya 106.46, Agni 111. 5, Padma, Adi 39. 79 and 43,46; (7) Daśāśvamedhaka (Matsya 106.46, Padma, Adi 39.80); (8) Urvašīpulina, suicide at which

Padma, Adi 43. 34-43, Agni 111. 13, Kurma I. 37.: 26-27);: (9) Rņapramocana, on the northern bank of Yamunā and to the south of Prayaga (Kurma I. 38. 14, Padma, Adi 44.20); (10) Mānasa on the north bank of the Ganges (Matsya 107.9, Padma, Adi 44.2, Agni 111.14); (11) Agnitirtha on the southern bank of the Jumnā (Matsya 108. 27, Kūrma I. 39.4, Padma, Adi 45. 27); (12) Viraja on the north bank of Yamuna (Padma, Adi 45.29); (13) Anaraka 1399 to the west of Dharmarāja (Kūrma I. 39.5). 

The Puranas lay down that if a man starts on a pilgrim age, but dies on the way to Prayāga he reaps great benefits even without reaching it, provided he dies remembering 

Prayaga. The Matsyapurana (105.8-12) asserts : 1400 A man whether in his own country or house or after leaving his country dies in a forest, while remembering Prayāga, he still secures the world of Brahma; he reaches a world where the

trees yield all desires, where the earth is full of gold and where there are sages and munis and siddhas; he dwells on the bank of the Ganges full of thousands of women and enjoys the company of sages; when he comes down from heaven he becomes the lord of Jambūdvīpa. 

At most famous tirthas the pilgrim has to perform śrāddha, The Visnu Dh. S. (chap. 85) mentions about fifty-five sacred places which are fittest for śrāddha. The Kalpataru (on tirtha), the Gangāvākyāvali, Tir. C. and other digests quote several verses from the Devipurāņa, the gist of which is as follows : Srāddha should be performed at tirthas, but there is no offering of arghya and no āvāhana (since pitrs are deemed to be always present at tīrthas, as the Kāśikhanda says) nor is the entering of the thumb of the invited brāhmaṇa into the food served done, nor is there the question about the brāhmaṇas being satiated, nor vikira 1401 If one is unable to follow the complete procedure of śrāddha one should merely offer pindas made from barley meal or may offer samyāva (cake of wheat flour fried with ghee and milk), rice boiled in milk, the cake of sesame (after the oil is extracted) or jaggery.1402 It should not be allowed to be seen by dogs, crows and vultures, it may be offered at any time after the pilgrim reaches the holy place. A śrāddha performed at a holy place gives great satisfaction to pitrs. Some of the works such as the Tristhalīsetusārasangraha of Bhattoji provide that after performing a pārvanaśrāddha at a tirtha and after making offerings of pindas to one's ancestors one should offer a single piņda to one's other relatives with the following mantra : "Here I offer pinda to deceased persons of my father's family, and of my mother's family and to the deceased relatives of my guru and of my father-in-law, to those men of my family

who were devoid of sons or wives and so who would lose the benefit of the pinda (to be offered by the son or wife) and in the case of whom all rites after death have ceased, those who were blind from birth or were cripples, those who were mal formed or died in the womb; to all these, whether known or unknown to me, may this (pinda) reach inexhaustively'! (Vāyu 110. 51-52). After this he should offer another pinda for his servants, slaves, friends, dependents, pupils, persons who conferred obligations on him, cattle, trees and those with whom he came in contact in other lives (Vāyu 110. 54-55). If a person is ill or has not the time to go through this elaborate pro cedure, then he should make a sankalpa that he would perform śrāddha and should offer a single pinda with the mantra (in Vāyu 110. 23-24) 'I offer this pinda to my father, grand-father, great-grand-father, to my mother, father's mother, grandfather's mother, to my maternal grandfather and to the latter's father and grandfather. May it reach them inexhaustively'! 

The Anušāsana-parva, the Kūrmapurāṇa, Nāradiya (uttara) 63. 19-20 and 36-38 and others highly praise bathing at the sangama in the month of Māgha 1403 Men of all castes, women and those born of mixed unions can take this bath; südras, women and men of 'mixed castes should not repeat any mantra but should bathe silently or with the word 'namah' (Tri. S. p. 39). Similarly, the Padma, Kūrma, Agni and other Purānas wax eloquent over a bath for three days in Māgha saying that it is equal to the gift of three crores of cows. 1404 There is great divergence as to exactly what three days are meant, as pointed out by the Tri. S. p. 33. The various views are: the three days are the passage of the sun into Capricornus, Rathasaptami and the full moon day of Māgha; the three consecutive days including the 10th of the bright half of Māgha; the first three days of Māgha; the three consecutive days from the 13th day of the bright half of Māgha; any three days in Māgha.

CHAPTER XIII 

KAŠĪ 

There is hardly any city in the world that can claim greater antiquity, greater continuity and greater popular veneration than Banaras. Banaras has been a holy city for at least thirty centuries. No city in India arouses the religious emotions of Hindus as much as Kāśi does. To the Hindu mind it represents great and unbroken traditions of religious sanctity and learning. It is a miniature of Hindu life through the ages in all its great complexities and contradictions. Not only Hinduism with its numerous sects has flourished here for numberless centuries, but the principles of Buddhism, one of the great religions of the world, were first proclaimed here by Sākyamuni after he received Enlightenment at Bodh-Gayā under the Bodhi tree. Thousands of verses are found in the epics and purāṇas about Banaras. Several volumes have been written about Banares during the last hundred years.1405 It would be impossible to do justice here to this vast mass of literature on Banaras. I shall briefly deal with the important topics relating to Banaras. In olden times the name was spelt as Benares, but recently as Banaras, which will be retained here (except in quotations). 

Before proceeding further, it is necessary to dwell, however briefly, on the ancient history of Banaras, The Satapatha Br. quotes 1406 a Gathā which states that Satānika, son of Satrājit, carried away the sacred sacrificial horse of the Kāšīs, as Bharata did in the case of the Satvats. In Sat. Br. XIV. 3. 1. 22 king Dhrtarāstra Vicitravīrya is called Kasya. In the Gopatha Br, we have 1407 the combination Kāśi-Kośalāh. The

Eween (Calcutta, 1886), 'The sacred city of the Hindus' by M.A. Sherring with a learned Introduction by Dr. F. E. Hall (London, 1886) and 110 photographs; 'Benares, the sacred city' by E. B. Havell (1905) with many fine illustrations; History of Benares' by Prof. A. S. Altekar (1937) with a few diagrams and photographs.

Ancient history of Kāśi 

619 

Cambridge History of India (vol. I. p. 117) remarks that in the Brāhmana period Kāśi, the capital of the Kāśis, was situated on the Varanāvati. In the Br. Up. (II.1.1) and the Kausitaki 1408 Up. (IV. 1.) there is the story of the proud Bālāki Gārgya going to Ajātaśatru, king of Kāśī, with the assurance that the former would expound brahma to the latter. In Panini IV. 2.116 Kašī heads a gana (Kāśyādibhyas-than-ithau'). Under Pāṇini IV.2. 113 we get the form "Kāśiyah.' It is remarkable that in the Sarvānukrama the rsi of Rg. X. 179.2 is stated to be Pratardana Kāśirāja. In tarpana, the Hir. Gr. (II. 8. 19.6) mentions Kāśi śvara along with Visnu and Rudraskanda (S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 244). Divodāsa figures frequently in the Rgveda. In Rg. I. 130.7 Indra is said to have conquered ninety cities for Divodāsa, while in Rg. IV. 30.20 it is stated that Indra gave 100 cities of stone to Divodāsa. From these Vedic references it may be surmised that in later works like the Epics and the Purāṇas Divodāsa was naturally credited with the founding of the most sacred city in India. In the Mahābhāsya on Vārtika 4 on Dān. IV. 1.54 (vol. II. p.223) we find the illustration 'Kāśi-Kosaliyāh.' The Mahābhāsya (vol. II, p. 413) furnishes the interesting information that there is a difference in the price of cloth manufactured at Kaśī and that manufactured at Mathurā, though the length and breadth of the piece of cloth be the same. This shows that even so early as the 2nd century B. C. Kāśi was famous for the fine qualities of its cloth, as now.1409 From the above passages it is clear that Kāśi was the name of a country long before the Satapatha Br. was composed and it remained so till the 2nd century B. C. (the date of Patañjali). We have a parallel example. Avanti is the name of a country as shown by Pān. IV.1.176 (striyām-avanti-kunti-kurubhyas-ca) and by the Meghadūta (Prāpyāvantin-udayana-), but Avanti or Avantikā is also the name of Ujjayini (as in the well-known verse 'Ayodhyā... Avantikā). Fa Hien (399 to 413 A. D.) is said to have arrived at the city of Vārāṇasī in the kingdom of Kāśi (Legge's tr, p. 94). This shows that about 400 A, D. Kāśi was still the name of the district and Vārānasi was its capital. But from the reference in the Mahābhāṣya it appears that Kāģi had then become the name of the city (and was also

the name of the country). In the Anušāsana-parva (chap. 30) it is said that Haryaśva, the grand-father of Divodāsa, was king of the Kasis 1409a and was harassed and killed by the Vitahavyas in the Doab between the Ganges and Jumna. Haryaśva's son was Sudeva who was crowned king of Kāśi (verse 13, Kāśirājos bhyasicyata) and he also met the same fate as his father did. Then Divodāsa, son of Sudeva, became king of the Kāśis and founded Vārānasi thickly populated with men of all varnas on the northern bank of the Gomati. This legend shows that Kāśi was the ancient name of a kingdom and the ancient belief was that Vārānasi was founded as the capital of the Kāśis by Divodāsa. In the Udyogaparva also Divodāsa is said to be the ruler of Kāśis.1410 

The Harivamsa (I. chap. 29) has a long but rather confused story about Divodāsa and Vārāṇasī.1411 It deals with the dynasty of Āyus, one of the sons of Aila. One of the descen dants of Ayus was Sunahotra who had three sons, Kāša, Sala and Grtsamada. From Kāģa arose a branch called Kāśayah. Dhanvantari, a descendant of Kāśa, was king of the Kāśis (verse 22). Divodāsa was great-grandson of Dhanvantari. He killed 100 sons of Bhadraśrenya, who first was Lord of Vārāṇasī. Then Siva sent his gana Nikumbha to destroy Vārānasi which had been occupied by Divodāsa. Nikumbha cursed it to be devastated for a thousand years. When it became devastated it came to be called Avimukta and Siva resided there. It was again re-established (verse 68) by Durdama, a son of Bhadrasrenya, whom, because he was a child, Divodāsa had not killed. Then Pratardana, son of Divo dāsa, took it from Durdama. Alarka, grandson of Divodāsa and king of Kašis, again established Vārāṇasī. This legend may contain some germs of truth, viz. that Vārānasi had become devastated several times and had often changed hands. The Vāyupurāņa (chap. 92) and the Brahmapurana (chap. 11) also contain the same legends of Dhanvantari, Divodāsa, and Alarka and the vicissitudes of Vārānasi,

Ancient history of Vārāṇasi 

621 

In the Mahābhāsya Patañjali states (vol. I. p. 380,) that Vārāṇasi is alongside of Gangā and on Pāņ. IV. 3. 84 (vol. II. p. 313) he informs us that traders call Vārāṇasī Jitvari. 

Ancient Buddhist works show that Banaras was, in the times of Buddha (5th Century B. C. at the latest), a great and famous city like Campā, Rajagrha, Srāvasti, Sāketa and Kaušāmbi (vide Mahāparinibbānasutta, S. B. E. vol. XI p. 99 and Mahāsudassanasutta, ibid. p. 247). The very fact that Buddha attained Enlightenment at Gayā (which was an out of the way place and on the borders, if at all, of Aryāvarta), thought it necessary to travel hundreds of miles from Gayā and preach his doctrines at Banaras in the Deer-park and set roll ing the wheel of the kingdom of Dharma at that place, clearly indicates that Banaras had then become a very holy place and was in the centre of all Aryan activities and culture (vide S. B. E, vol. XI. p. 153 and vol. XIII p. 90, Mahāvagga, S. B. E. vol. 17 p. 21). King Brahmadatta of Banaras figures in many jātaka stories. Hardly any part of the jātaka tales can be placed earlier than the 3rd century B.C. But it may be admitted that Banaras was well-known as the capital of Brahmadatta kings several centuries before Christ. The Matsyapurāṇa 273, while enumerating hundreds of kings bearing the same surnames, states that there were 100 Brahmadattas and 100 Kāśis and Kušas 1412 But the very fact that Brahmadattas are separately mentioned from the Kāśis largely reduces the value of this piece of information. The ancient Jain works also speak of Banaras and Kasi. In the Kalpasūtra it is said that Arhat Pārsva was born in Banaras in the month of Caitra on the 4th day of the dark fortnight (S. B. E. vol. XXII p. 271) and that when Mahāvīra died the 18 confederate kings of Kasi and Kosala along with other kings of the Licchavis and Mallakis instituted an illumination on the day of the New Moon (ibid. p. 266). Ašvaghoṣa appears to identify Vārānasi with Kasi when he says in his Buddhacarita 'Having entered Vārānasi, the Jina (Buddha) illumining the city with his light filled the minds of all the inhabitants of Kāśi with excessive interest."1413 The Buddhacarita further speaks of Buddha as having gone under the shadow of a tree near Vaņārā (S. B. E. vol. 49 part Ipa

169), which is probably the Varaņā. It is thus clear that Vārānasi and Kāśī had become synonyms at least sometime about the first century A. D. In the Vāyupurāņa 45. 110 Kāśi-kośalāḥ figure among the countries of Madhyadeśa. 

In the Viṣnupurāṇa we have the story of Paundraka Vāsudeva who challenged Krsna and asked the latter to surren der his Cakra and other symbols. He was helped by the king of Kāśi. The combined armies of Paundraka and Kāśirāja attacked Krspa who killed Paundraka and cut off Kāśirāja's head (with his discus) which fell in the city of Kāśi. His son performed austerities, propitiated Sankara and secured from him a Krtyā (ogress) which entered Vārāṇasī. Krspa's discus in pursuit of her burnt the whole of Vārānasi together with its king, his servants and citizens. In this account from the Visnupurāṇa (V. 34) the names Kāśī, Vārānasi and Avimukta are employed as synonyms (verses 14, 21, 25, 30, 39). The same legend occurs in the same words in Brahmapurāṇa, chap. 207 and is briefly referred to in Sabhāparva, chap. 14. 18-20 and chap. 34. 11. 

From the above-mentioned accounts in the Epic and Purānas about Kāśi and Mahadeva, various conclusions 1414 have been drawn by writers, viz, that Mahādeva was a god of the non Aryans, that Banaras was a centre of non-Aryan worship for a long time after the advent of the Aryans and that the people of Banaras, though they ultimately turned to the Aryan religion, were more interested in the philosophic speculations of the Upanisadic age. I dissent from most of these conclusions. We are on most unsafe ground as regards these conclusions. None of the extant Puranas can claim to be older than the 3rd or 4th century A, D. Most people in India lived and even now live a humdrum, placid and unattractive life in which there is nothing to satisfy the ordinary man's appetite for the mysteri ous, the unusual and the horrible. The purāṇas contain stories that may be divided into several classes and that satisfied the above-mentioned cravings of the common man. Many of the

The Naradiya (uttara, chap. 29) states that Banaras was at first the city of Madhava, but later on became a Saiva-ksetra; is there are real historical basis here? If any historical conclusion is to be drawn from this statement of the Naradiyapurāņa it would be exactly the opposite ou what Prof. Altekar has drawn, viz, that the non-Aryans scored a cultural victory over the Aryans at Banaras.

Conclusions from legends about Banaras 

623 

legends contained in the purāṇas were meant for the entertain ment of common people, just as even in these days millions in 

Western countries read with relish detective stories and crime club fiction. Some paurānic legends had a serious purpose in view viz emphasizing religious or philosophical dogma or moral values and standards and were clothed in a supernatural garb to make them striking and effective. Only a few legends have some historical basis, but the latter is evidently smothered in a mass of exaggerations and prejudices for or against a hero, or a caste, class, tribe or family. It is hardly fair to draw far reaching historical conclusions from heterogeneous materials in the purāṇas about the conditions of things that prevailed several hundreds or thousands of years before they were compiled. The purāṇas often speak of the quarrels and bickerings among high gods and sages. For example, the Viṣnupurāņa V. 30.65 speaks of a fight between Indra and Krsna. Was Krsna a non Aryan god originally? Ganesa's left tooth was shattered by the missile of Parasurāma who comes to fight with Rāma, both being supposed to be avatāras of Visņu. The sage Bhrgu curses Viṣnu, Gautama curses Indra, Māndavya curses Dharma (vide for all these, Brahmānda II. 27. 21-25). 

In several purāṇas Kāsi or Vārāṇasi has been lauded and described at great length. Vide Matsya 180-185 ( 411 verses ), Kūrma 1.31-35 (verses 226 ), Lingapurāņa (pürvabhāga, chap. 92, verses 190 ), Padma (Adikhanda 33-37, verses 170), Agni 112, Skanda, Kāśikhanda, chap. 6 ff., Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 48-51). The Kāśikhanda alone has about 15000 verses1415 on Banaras and its sub-tirthas. In the Padmapurāṇa the sages are said to have asked Bhrgu five questions, viz. what is the greatness of Kāśi, how it is to be understood, who should resort to it, what is its extent (or boundaries ) and by what means it (Kāśi) can be secured. In the Skandapurāṇa, 

1415. Dr. Fitz-Edward Hall (Introduction to Sherring's work P. XXXII n. 3) criticizes Dr. Wilson for holding that the greater part of the Kasikhanda is anterior to the first attack on Banaras by Mahmud of Gazni and holds that it is later than the Gaznivide invader. Dr. Hall advances hardly any convincing reasons. The work of Alberuni is definite that sultan Mahmud of Gazni had not spread his depredations as far as Banaras (vide Sachau, vol. 1 p. 22): This is the reason why Hindu Sciences...hano Hedo, places which our hand cannot yet reach, to Kashmir, Benares and her places.' The Kalpataru on Tirtha quotes about one hundred verses on Varanasi

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. Kāśikhanda 1416 (chap. 26,2-5) the following questions are asked, viz. from what time this holy place Avimukta became highly famous, how it received the name Avimukta, how it became the way to mokṣa, how the pool of Manikarnikā became an object of worship to the three worlds, what was there formerly (when) the Ganges was not there, how it came to be called Vārānasi, Kasi, Rudrāvāsa, how it came to be Ananda kānana (the forest of bliss ) and then Avimukta and Mahāśmaśāna ( the great cemetery). 

Banaras has been known for centuries under five different names viz. Vārāṇasī, Kāśī, Avimukta, Ānandakānana and Śmaśāna or Mahāśmaśāna. The Kāśikhanda states that Śankara first called it Ānandakānana and then Avimukta, 1417 

(Continued from the last page) from the Skandapurāṇa and holds the latter work to be as authoritative as the Matsyapurāṇa, Lingapurāṇa and other Puranas. The Kalpataru of Lakshmi dhara was composed about 1110 A.D. (vide Prof. Aiyangar's Introduction to Tirthakānda pp. XVIII-XIX). Therefore a century or two at least before 1100 A.D. there existed a Skandapurana, part of which contained a eulogium of Banaras. Unfortunately the present printed Kasikhanda of the Skanda does not agree with the quotations from the Skanda given by the Kalpataru. A curious state of things is divulged as regards the quotations from Skanda in the Kalpataru. For example, on pp. 36-37 of the Kalpataru on Tirtha, about 19 verses are quoted from Skanda which occur verbatim in the Lingapurana, chap. 92. 120-142 (with the addition of some half verses). Similarly, on p. 44 of the Kalpataru three verses are quoted from Skanda, which are the same as Linga. 92. 87-89. On p. 42 Kalpataru quotes one verse about Gopreksesvara from Skanda which is quoted from the Lingapurāṇa by Tri. S. p. 171. Some of the Puranas say that the Skanda has 81101 verses (Matsya 53.42-43). But the Skanda printed at the Venkatesvara press contains several thousand verses more. It appears that there were different recens ions of the Skanda. The Tri. S. quotes verses from specific chapters of the Kasikhanda which are generally found in the printed work. Vide p. 193 (for chap. 30), 190 (for chap. 32), p. 144 (for chap. 34). p. 160 for chap. 45. p. 154 for chap. 49, pp. 157 and 200 for chap. 61 etc.

The derivation of the word Kāśi 

625 

A few words must be said about the derivation and significance of these words as gathered from the Purānas and other works. And first comes Kāśī. It is derived from the root kāś 'to shine.' The Skandapurāṇa 1418 says that the city of Kāśī became famous by that name because it sheds light on the way to) nirvāna (final release) or because that indescribable refulgence, viz. God Siva shines forth there. The name Vārāṇasī is derived in several Purānas from the names of two streams Varanā 1419 (modern Bārnā) and Asi, which are respectively the northern and southern boundaries of the modern city. From the passages quoted below from the Skandapurana (Kasi-khanda) it appears that Asi is the correct form of the name of the river. The names most frequently used in the Puranas are Vārānasi and Avimukta. In the Jābālopaniṣad 1420 the words Avimukta, Varanā and Nāsi are brought together in an esoteric sense. "Atri asked Yājñavalkya: how is one to know the unmanifested Self? Yajñavalkya explained that he was to be worshipped in Avimukta, since the self is centered in Avimukta. Then a question was asked: in what is Avimukta centered or established? The reply is that Avimukta is established in the midst of Varaņā and Nāsi. Varaṇā is so called because it

In काशीखण्ड 30.18 there is a pun on the word असि (a sword, the river) 'असिं महासिरूपां च प्राप्य सन्मतिखण्डनीम् । दक्षिणोत्तरदिग्भागे कृत्वाासें वरणां सुराः । क्षेत्रस्य मोक्ष निक्षेपरक्षानिवृतिमाययुः॥ क्षेत्रस्य पश्चादिग्भागे तं देहलिविनायकम्। काशीखण्ड 30. 20-21; वरुणा (वरणा?) च असी चापि द्वे नद्यौ सुरवल्लभे । अन्तरालं तयोः क्षेत्र मध्ये (वध्या?) न विशते वाचत् । पद्म V.14.191: वध्या means हत्या.

wards off all faults due to the senses and Nāsi destroys all sins due to the senses. Then a question is asked: what is its loca tion (sthāna)? The reply is that it is the conjunction of the eyebrows and the nose i. e. the upāsanā (contemplation) of Avimukta is to be made as located in the span between the eyebrows and the root of the nose." Here it will be seen that Varaņā and Nāsi are the names (and not Varana and Asi). The Vāmanapurāņa employs the form Asi (15.50-53). The same is the case with the Padma. 

The name Avimukta has generally been explained as derived from the negative particle 'na' (for which 'a' is substi tuted) and vimukta (forsaken). Many Purāņas say that the holy place is so called because it was never forsaken by Siva (some times both Siva and his consort). 1421 In the Lingapurāņa another derivation is suggested: 1422 "avi means 'sin'; that holy place is devoid of sin". The Kaśikhanda (39.74 ) states that originally the kṣetra was called Anandakānana and then Avimukta because though Siva went to stay on Mandara mountain he did not leave it entirely but left his linga there. 

Vārāṇasī is very dear to Siva, it gives him joy and there fore it is called Anandavana or Anandakanana, 1423 It is also styled Smaśāna or Mahāśmaśāna for various reasons. As a belief was entertained by all people that death in Banaras freed a man from samsāra, and as the thoughts and aspirations of pious Hindus ran in the direction of dying on the sacred soil of Banaras, the old and decrepit crowded therein and persons seriously ill got themselves removed or were removed to the banks of the Ganges when about to die and were cremated there. Cremation of corpses is always seen on the Manikarnikā ghūt near the Ganges. A śmaśāna (cemetery ) is considered impure but Banaras with the sacred Ganges was purest in spite of being always the cremation ground for thousands in a year. 11421. मुने प्रलयकालेपि न तत्क्षेत्रं कदाचन । विमुक्तं हि शिवाभ्यां यदविमुक्तं ततो fag:ll Fa , Fisflo 26.27 q. by ferreroro p. 89; for (yarul) 92.45-46 विमुक्तं न मया यस्मान्मोक्ष्यते वा कदाचन । मम क्षेत्रमिदं तस्मादविमुक्तमिति स्मृतम् ॥; almost (the same verse is prett (ar) 48.24 : vide art. 180,54 and 181.15, nr.

Why Kāśi is called Śmaśāna 

6277 

The Skanda says: 1424 ' sma' means a corpse and 'śāna ' means 'lying down'; when the end of the world comes, the great elements lie here as corpses and therefore this place is called Mahāšmasāna." The Padmapurāṇa 1425 makes Siva say: 'Avi mukta is a famous cemetery: becoming the Destroyer (or the Time Spirit ) I being here destroy the world'. Matsya very frequently speaks of Vārāṇasī as Smaśāna. The Kāsikhanda states: if a man after reaching the great cemetery dies there by fate he has never again to lie in the cemetery (i. e. he is not born again). 

Although generally Kāśi, Varanasi and Avimukta are used as synonyms in the Purānas, in some passages a distinction is made between these as to extent. The passages quoted above ( in note 1419) show that Varanasi is bounded by the Varana, and Asi on the north and south, 1426 the Ganges on the east and the shrine of Vināyaka in the west. Ain. A. (vol. II p. 158) remarks that Benares is a large city situated between the rivers Barnā and Asi and that it is built in the form of a bow of which the Ganges forms the string. The Matsyapurana 1427 states: 'that kṣetra is two yojanas and a half east and west and half a yojana broad north and south; out of this Vārānasi extends up to the dry river (viz. Asi)'. The first part appears to deal with the entire Kāśiksetra which according to the Padmapurāṇa 1428 comprised the tract covered by a circle the radius of which was the line joining Madhyameśvara-linga

with the shrine of Dehali-Ganesa. The Matsyapurana (in * chap. 183.61-62) makes it two yojanas in extent. Agni 112.6 also does the same. But that is only approximate. The actual distance covered by a yojana varied. Vide H, of Dh. vol. III. pp. 145-146 n. 185. Rhys Davids in Numismata Orientalia' (London, 1877) after examining 30 passages from Pāli texts comes to the conclusion that a yojana was equal to about 7 or 8 miles. Avimukta is said to be that part of the holy place which is represented by a radius of 200 dhanus (i, e. 800 hastas or about 1200 feet) in all four directions from the shrine of Visvešvara, 1429 There was no unanimity on the extent of Avimukta. In Kāśikhanda Avimukta 1429a is said to be five krošas in extent. But there Avimukta appears to stand for Kasi. The innermost 1430 circle in the holy Kasiksetra is defined as that between Gokarnesvara to the west, the mid stream of the Ganges to the east, Bhārabhūta to the north and Brahmeśvara to the south. A few more passages on the extent of the sacred place of Banaras may be cited here in one place. The Lingapurana1431says: 'thisksetra is declared to be four krošas (in extent) in the four directions and also one yojana'. The Naradiyapurana 1432 puts the extent thus (The ksetra) extends over two yojanas and a half from east to west and is half a yojana wide from north to south; god Sambhu declared the extent of the kṣetra between the rivers Varuņā and Asi ( which latter is ) a dried-up stream.' In the Padmapurāņa 1133

Extent of Kāśi in medieval works 

629 

Brahmā is supposed to have said to Rudra 'I have given you a kṣetra of the extent of five krošas; when the best of rivers, Ganga, will flow through this ksetra, the city will be great and holy; the Ganges, as it flows northwards (in Banaras) for two yojanas, will be holy'. If in any texts there be any differences between the extents of Avimukta, it must be supposed that there is an option; 1434 (or, as the Tir. C, suggests, the differences refer to different kalpas i, e. ages ). It is clear that Vārānasi was that strip of land, the four boundaries of which were the Ganges to the east, Asi to the south, the shrine of Dehali Vināyaka to the west and the river Varanā to the north. In the 7th century Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese pilgrim, notes that Banaras was 18 lis (about 31 miles ) in length and about 5 or 6 lis (a little more than a mile) in breadth, This makes it clear that the city was then bounded as now by the Varanā and Asi. Vide Beal's B. R. W. W. (vol. II p.44). 

Verses laudatory of the greatness and uniqueness of Vārāṇasī literally run into thousands. All that can be done here is to set out a few characteristic verses. The Vanaparva observes : 1435 a person coming to Avimukta and resorting to the sacred place becomes free from the sin of brāhmana-murder by 

merely seeing the (image of the) Lord of gods (i. e. Visvesvara) and if he dies there he secures mokṣa. The Matsyapurāṇa 1436 contains many striking passages about the unique greatness of Banaras: "Vārānasi is always my most secret place; it is always the cause of moksa for all beings. Moksa may be effected in Prayāga or in this city because I have taken it under my protection; this place is greater than even Prayāga, the fore most among tirthas. All the sins 1437 that a man may have

Even if a man be a sinner 1439 or a rogue or irreligious he becomes free from all sins if he goes to Avimukta. Other women,1440 that act as they like and are intently devoted to enjoyments, when they die here by lapse of time secure the highest worlds. In this world moksa 1441 cannot be secured by men without the (practice of) Yoga; but in the case of those who reside in A.vimukta Yoga and moksa are both secured. For planets,1442 lunar mansions and stars there is the danger of falling (from the sky) in course of time but there is no fall for those who die in Avimukta.

ingly-all those are reduced to ashes when he enters Avimukta. Even a mleccha resident in Kāśi is better, since his future will be blissful, but not one residing elsewhere, though he may be a diksita, because he will not be a recipient of mukti.” 

In some passages a mystic flavour is imparted to Vārānasi and the rivers. For example, the Kāśikhanda says that Asi is the Idā nādi, Varanā is the Pingalā nādi, Avimukta is susumņā and Vārānasi is all the three.1444 The Lingapurāṇa, however, puts the matter somewhat differently. It holds that Asi (the dried-up river), Varaņā and Matsyodari (i.e. Ganges) are respectively the Pingalā, Idā and Suṣumnā. 

It is time now to turn to the individual sacred spots in Banaras. It is stated in some of the Puranas 1145 that at every step in the Kāśiksetra there is a holy place and that there is not even as much space as a sesamum seed in Kāśi which has not a linga (emblem of Siva). As a matter of fact the Kāśikhanda names 64 lingas in chap. 10 alone. But one must look to the tirthas that are specifically named. Hiouen Thsang says that there were one hundred temples at Banaras in his day and he speaks of a temple where the copper image of Deva Maheśvara was a little less than 100 feet high (vide Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II. pp. 44-45). Unfortunately, the fanatical zeal and ruth lessness of Moslem rulers demolished almost all Hindu temples at different times from 1194 to about 1670 A. D. Mosques and mausoleums were erected on their sites, and the materials of the temples thus razed were used in constructing mosques and for serving as breakwaters &c. Kutubdin Aibak destroyed about 1000 temples in 1194 A. D. (vide Elliot and Dowson's History of India', vol. II. p. 222). Alauddin Khilzi boasted that he had destroyed one thousand temples in Banaras alone (vide Sherring p. 31, Havell p. 76). About 1585 A, D. Nārāyana bhatta re-established the temple of Viśvanātha with the help

of Rājā Todarmal 1446. Even this temple was desecrated. The following passage from the Ma-A'sir-i-A'lamgiri quoted by Elliot and Dowson ('History of India,' vol. VII. p. 184) is in structive: "It reached the ears of his Majesty, the protector of the faith, that in the provinces of Thatta, Multan and Benares, but especially in the latter foolish brāhmaṇas were in the habit of expounding frivolous books in their schools and that students and learners, Musalmans as well as Hindus, went there even from long distances, led by a desire to become acquainted with the wicked sciences they taught. The Direc tor of the Faith' consequently issued orders to all the gover nors of provinces to destroy with a willing hand the schools and temples of the infidels; and they were strictly enjoined to put an entire stop to the teaching and practising of idolatrous forms of worship. On the 15th Rabiu-lakhir (i, e. December 1669) it was reported to his religious Majesty, leader of the Unitarians, that in obedience to order, the Government officers had destroyed the temple of Bishnath at Benares." 

A mosque, which still exists, was built on the site of the Visvešvara temple by Aurangzeb, who even changed the name of Banaras to Muhammadabad. The result is that, as stated by Sherring (p. 32), it would be difficult to find twenty temples in the whole of Banaras of the age of Aurangzeb (1658-1707 A. D.). Many of the temples were built by the Maratha Chiefs and Sardars and during the British occupation many more were built. Prinsep calculated in about 1828 that there were in the Banaras city proper 1000 Hindu temples and 333 mos ques; a more recent estimate puts the figures at 1454 temples and 272 mosques (Sherring 1447 pp. 41-42). 

Visveśvara or Viśvanātha is the tutelary deity of Banaras and the principal and most holy temple in it (vide n. 1429 a). It is prescribed that every resident of Kasi must every day bathe in the Ganges and visit the temple of Visvesvara (vide Tri. S. p. 214). After Aurangzeb pulled down the temple of Višva nātha, there was no shrine of Viśvanātha in Benares for over a hundred years. The linga was probably removed from place 

1446. Vide Altekar pp. 47-48 and Introduction to my edition of the Vyavahāramayukha p. VIII (Poona, 1926), where I cite a verse from the Dānahirāvali-prakasa of Divakarabhatta, a daughter's son of Nilakarikas who was the grandson of Nārāyanabhatta, 

1447. Havell (p. 76) remarks that there are 1500 temples and may smaller shrines or images in niches of walls or the like are countless.

to place as the vicissitudes of the times required and the pil grims performed parts of the worship (such as namaskāra and circumambulation) at the site of the image, but they could not perform other portions of the worship such as bathing the image with Ganges water 1448. The present temple of Visvanātha was built in the last quarter of the 18th century by Devi Ahalyābāi Holkar (Altekar, p. 57). The Tri. S. p. 183, while on the question of the appearance (prādurbhāva) of Visvešvara, observes that there is no blemish in the case of the Visvešvara linga due to the touch of the untouchable, that every day Visveśvara removes it by a bath in Manikarnikā at dawn and the worship offered by Himself and quotes a verse of the Sanat kumāra-samhita in support 1449. What the Tri. S. means is: Generally great care is taken about lingas. All and sundry are not allowed to touch them but in the case of the Visve svara-linga any one, even a great sinner, may worship it and pour Ganges water over it. Whether Nārāyaṇabhatta meant that even the so-called untouchables might touch it is not clear. 

It appears that Vācaspati 1449a holds that Avimukteśvara linga is the same as Visvanātha, but both the Tristhali-setu (p. 296) and Tir. Pr. (p. 187) reject this idea. The Skanda purāṇa (Kāśi, 10.93) mentions Visveśvara and Avimukteśvara as separate lingas. Besides worshipping Visvanatha, every pilgrim to Benares has to visit the five tirthas 1450 (Pancatirthi). According to the Matsyapurāņa the five essential tirthas in the Anandakānana of Visveśvara are Daśāśvamedha, Lolarka 1450a

Keśava, Bindumādhava and Manikarnikā.1451 In modern times the five essential tirthas called Pañcatirthi are the confluence of the Asi with the Ganges, the Daśāśvamedha ghāt, Maņi karnikā, the Pañcagangā ghāt and the confluence of the river Varaņā (called Bārņā by the common people) with the Ganges. This is based on the Kāśikhanda.1452 The shrine of Lolārka is situated at the confluence of the Asi (the southern boundary of Banaras) with the Ganges. The Kāśikhanda 1453 furnishes a popular etymology for the name Lolārka, viz. that the mind of the Sun on seeing Kāśī became agitated. The Asi is a tolerably wide stream (about 40 feet) in the rainy season, but is dry at other times. The several gigantic ghats with their flights of stone steps are a grand sight at Banaras. The Ganges while passing by Banaras takes a great sweep so that its mighty current flows in a northerly direction (that is towards the Himālaya) and is therefore held to be peculiarly holy here. The Daśāśvamedha-ghat has been famed for centuries, Jayaswal's interpretation of the epithets applied to the Bhāra sivas in Vākātaka grants should be accepted viz, the Bhārasivas were an imperial dynasty, were crowned with the holy waters of the Ganges and took their ceremonial baths on the Ganges at the end of ten Ašvamedha sacrifices, on account of which the Daśāśvamedha-ghāt 1454 at Banaras was so named (Jayaswal's 

History of India' 150 A.D.-350 A, D. p. 5). In order to realize the grandeur of Banaras on the side of the river one must be at

the Daśāśvamedhaghāt at dawn. For the eulogy of Daśāśva medha, vide Kāśikhanda 52. 83 ff. and Tri. S. p. 159. The Kāśikhanda says that formerly the tirtha was called Rudrasaras, but as Brahmā performed ten Aśvamedhas there it came to be called Daśāśvamedha (chap. 52. 66-68). The Manikarnika (also called Mukti-ksetra) pool is the very centre of the religious life of Banaras and 1455 is the most holy among all the Banaras tīrthas. The Kāśikhanda gives a phantastic story of its origin (in chapter 26 verses 51-63 quoted in Tri. S. pp. 145-146): Viṣnu dug with his discus a puskarini, filled it with the perspiration from his own body and performed severe austerities on its bank for 1050 (or 50000) years. Siva came there and being pleased shook his head and an ear-ornament studded with jewels fell into the pool, which thenceforward came to be called Mani. karnikā. The word is 1456 derived in two ways in the Kāśi khanda. Siva who is like the wish-yielding jewel whispers in the ear (karņikā) of good men the Tāraka mantra at the time of death. The extent of Manikarnikā north to south is said to be 105 hastas i. e, about 160 feet (Kāśikhanda 99.54). In modern times the waters of the Manikarnikā pool become foul and fetid because it is shallow (two or three feet deep), because hundreds of pilgrims cast into it flowers and money by way of worship and because the priests stir the waters with their hands and feet to find the coins dropped by pilgrims. Our methods of worship must be changed. The flowers and gifts should be placed on the banks of the pool and then taken away by the priests. The Tri. S. p. 147 mentiong several mantras (two of which are set out below to be recited when contemplating on Manikarnikā 1457. Near the Mani karpikā pool is the temple of Tārakeśvara so named from the belief that Siva will whisper the mantra called tāraka in the ear of

the dying man brought to the sacred pool1457a (vide Kāśikhanda 7.78, 25. 72-73 and 32. 115-116). The Pañcagangā ghāt is so called because it is supposed that five rivers, viz. the Kiraņā,1458 Dhūtapāpā, Gangā, Yamunā and Sarasvati, meet here (though four of them are invisible). This is very highly eulogised and it is said in the Nāradiyapurāṇa and the Kāśikhanda (59. 118-133) that when a man takes a bath in the Pañcanada he is not born again in a body made up of the five elements. It is said that this confluence of five rivers had different names viz. Dharmanada, Dhūtapātaka, Bindutirtha and Pañcanada in Kệta and the following Yugas respectively. The Kāśikhanda in chap. 59 deals with the confluence of five rivers and gives phantastic legends as to why the rivers were called Kiraņā (59. 108–113) and Dhūtapāpā (59. 101-106). The river Varaņā is the northern boundary of Vārāṇasi and the end of the ghāts on the northern side is reached at the confluence of the Varanā with the Ganges. That the ghāts have been there for at least a thousand years can be proved from copperplates and inscrip tions. The Gāhadvāla rulers of Kanoj (of whose times at least 55 copperplates and 3 inscriptions on stone were issued during the period 1097 to 1187 A, D.), being devotees of Visnu, several times made grants at the Adi-Keśava ghāt.

Grants at ghāts by Gahadvāla kings 

637 

and Varaņā bestowed on 500 brāhmaṇas 30 villages on the Akṣayya-trtīyā of samvat 1156). Those rulers made grants at other ghāts and sacred spots also. For example, E. I. vol. IV. pp. 97 ff. (21 copperplates of Gahadvālas, of which H in samvat 1178 speaks of the grant of a village after a bath at the Kapāla. mocana-ghatta at Banaras where the Ganges flows towards the north; grant L. p. 114 of saṁvat 1197 made on a queen taking a bath at the ghatta of god Vedešvara in Avimuktaksetra; grant S. mentions god Krttivāsa; grant U. is made to the temple of Lolarka by Jayacandra in saivat 1233), E. I. vol. VIII p. 149 (five copperplate grants of Govindacandra in samvat 120% i e 1156 A, D, after a bath at Kotitirtha on Uttarāyana-sankrānti) The Kasi-khanda promises Varuna-loka to those charitable people that build stone ghāts on the sacred rivers 1460. 

One of the most meritorious of all pilgrimages is the Pañcakrośí by road. Lakṣmidhara in his section on Tirthas in the Krtyakalpataru apparently takes no notice of it. The length of the Pancakrośī road is about 50 miles and there are hundreds of shrines on the road. Taking Manikarnikā as the centre the whole road describes an irregular semicircle round the city of Banaras with a radius of five krošas (about ten miles) and hence it is called pancakrosi. The word 'pañcakroši' occurg very often in the Kāśikhanda (as in chap, 26, verses 80 and 114 chap. 55. 44). This pilgrimage may be very briefly described as follows:- The pilgrim starts from the Manikarnika-ghāt and going along the bank of the Ganges arrives at the confluence of the river Asi with the Ganges and halts for the day at a village called Khāndava about six miles from Manikarnikā. The 2nd day's march (for eight or ten miles) ends at the village called Dhūpacandi where he offers worship to the goddess of that name. On the 3rd day the pilgrim walks 14 miles to the village Rāmeśvara. On the 4th day he walks eight miles and reaches the village Sivapura. On the 5th day he walks 6 miles and reaches the village Kapiladhārā, where the pilgrim offers oblations to his pitrs. On the 6th day he walks from Kapila dhārā to Varanasangama and thence to Manikarnikā, a disa tance of six miles. It is the practice for pilgrims to scatter grains of barley from Kapiladhārā to Manikarnikā. The pil grim bathes, pays dakṣiņā to the priest and then goes to the temple of Sākṣi-Vināyaka who is supposed to bear witness ta the pilgrim's having performed the Pañcakrośi-yātrā. THE

I Vol. 

There are numerous other sub-tirthas in Banaras, some of which may be briefly noticed here. The Jñānavāpi may be mentioned first. The story of its origin is narrated in the Kāśikhanda, chap. 33. The Tri. S. (pp. 148-150) refers to it. It is said that when Siva (īsāna) saw the Visvesvara-linga a desire arose in him to bathe with its cool water. He dug a kunda with his trident to the south of the temple of Visvešvara and with the water therefrom he bathed Visvešvara-linga and Visvešvara granted the boon that the tirtha would be superior to all tīrthas and that, as Siva is knowledge (verse 32), the tirtha would be called Jñānoda or Jñānavāpi. One of the most popular and the most frequented temple is that of Durgā. In chap.72 (verses 37-65) of the Kāśikhanda there is a Durgāstotra called Vajra-pañjara which is referred to in Tri. S. p. 161. There is a temple of Bhairavanātha about a mile to the north of the temple of Visvešvara. He is the Kotwal or police Magistrate of Kāśī and wields a stone cudgel (of enormous thickness). His vāhana is a dog. Vide Kāśikhanda, chap. 30, for Bhairava. There are many temples of Gaņeśa. The Tri. S. (pp. 198-199) names 56 Ganeśas and indicates their locations, following Kāśikhanda, chap. 57.59-115 (ṣat-pañcāsad-Gaja mukhān-etān-yah samsmarisyati). In Kāśikhanda (57, 33) the name Dhundhi applied to Ganesa is derived from the root ahudhi' in the sense of 'searching' (anveṣaņe dhudhir-ayam prathitosti dhātuḥ). Compare the Marathi verb dhundaņe. 

The Tri. S. discusses at some length (pp. 98-100) the question whether sins committed in all past lives are destroyed by entering Kāśi or whether it is only the sins committed during the present life that are destroyed. Some hold the view that sins committed in this life only are destroyed by visiting Kāśi and by bath in the various sacred spots the sins of previous lives are destroyed. Others hold that by entering Kāšī the sins of all past lives are destroyed, but bath at various sacred spots brings about only the cessation of the tendency to sin in different lives. Nārāyaṇabhatta puts forward several other views and says that wise men should hold the view that appears proper. 

Many of the purāṇas lay down rules about how one dwell. ing in Kaśī should act. The injunction is that in Kāší onie should not commit the slightest sin, since the punishment is far more heavy. The Matsya (chap. 185. 17-45) and Kasia khanda, chap. 96, narrate the story of Vyasa, who while wandering about for alms in Kāsi, did not secure alminder hente

being hungry and angry was on the point of cursing Kasi in the words quoted below 1461 when Siva coming to know his mind assumed the form of a householder, gave him the best of food and ordered Vyāsa not to enter Kāśiksetra as he was an irr table man, but allowed him to do so on the 8th and 14th tithis only. The Kāśikhanda 96. 12-80 and 119-180 speak at great length about how one residing in Kasi should conduct himself. 

Some miscellaneous matters in connection with Banaras may be set out here. Vārāṇasī being a great tirtha, śrāddha for the benefit of ancestors should be performed there and if it is not possible to perform a śrāddha with all details, at least offerings of pindas should be made.1462 The construction of mathas for those who practise penance there and endowing them with means for their maintenance are highly eulogized.1463 

In the 12th century A. D. there was a Kapālamocanaghāt 1464 situated on the Ganges. In a grant published in E. I. vol. IV p. 110 dated samvat 1178 (1122 A. D.) the Emperor Govindacandra bestowed a village on a brāhmaṇa named Vyāsa after bathing at the Kapāla-mocanaghatta in Banaras where the Ganges flows to the north. The story of Kapālamocana-tirtha is narrated in the Matsya-purāņa, chap. 183. 84-103 and a reference is made to it in Kāśikhanda 33. 116. 

It may be noted that in the Lingapurāṇa, pūrvārdha, chap. 92 verses 67-100, in Padma,1464a Adikhanda, chap. 34-37, 

1461. तीर्थ चातीर्थतां यातु नगरं शापयाम्यहम् ॥ मा भूविपौरुषी विद्या मा भूस्त्रि पौरुषं धनम् । मा भूत्रिपौरुषं सख्यं व्यासो वाराणसी शपन् ॥ अविमुक्ते निवसतां जनानां yuzne fasa A

Dr. Altekar (pp. 28-29) notes that at present a ghāt and a tank near the Rajaghat station is known by the name Kapalamocanaghat, that there exists a temple near this tank dedicated to Kapalamocanesvara and that the god must have been removed from the original place to the present habitation at some time during the last 700 years.

The Kāśikhanda, chap. 73. 32–36 (quoted by Tri. S. pp. 264–265) mentions 14 of these as Mahālingas, viz, Omkāra, Trilocana, Mahādeva, Kittivāsas, Ratnesa, Candreśvara, Kedāra, Dharmesa, Vireśvara, Kāmesa, Viśvakarmeśvara, Manikarniša, Avimukta, Visvešvara. It is provided in Kāśi khanda 73. 39 that yātrās of these main lingas should be cele brated every month from the 1st tithi onwards. In Kāśikhanda 73. 45-48 there is another series of fourteen great lingas diffe rent from those in chap. 73. 32-36. Fourteen āyatanas are named in Kāśikhanda 73. 60-62.14646 Twelve out of these are specified as lingas in Lingapurāṇa I. 92.67-107. In Kāśikhanda chapters 83 and 84 are enumerated about 125 tirthas of Banaras. In chap. 94. 36 of the Kāśikhanda 36 principal lingas are re ferred to (14 Omkārādi, 8 Dakṣeśvarādi and 14 Saileśādi). From considerations of space the other lingas and tirthas are not mentioned here. But out of all these Visvešvara is said to give quick results. 

It is laid down that every one residing in Kāśi must repair every day to the Ganges, take a bath in the Manikarnikā and visit Visvešvara,1465 

What happens if a person commits sins outside Kāśi, comes to Kāśi and then dies, or if a resident of Kāśi commits sins in Kāśi but dies either at Kaśī or outside it? The Tri. S. after quoting several verses from the Kāśikhanda, Padma purāṇa and Brahmavaivarta states the following conclusions (p. 268). Sins committed elsewhere are destroyed by coming to Kāśi.1466 He who residing in Kāśi is always addicted to sins becomes a piśāca (goblin) for thirty thousand years, again dwells in Kāśi, secures highest knowledge and then obtains

Kāśi and committing of sins

mokṣa. Those who being residents of Kāśi commit sins have not to undergo the tortures of Yama whether they die in Kāśi or elsewhere. Those who after committing sins in Kāśi die there will be punished by Kalabhairava. Those who die else where (after committing sins in Kāśi) first undergo torments inflicted by the ganas of Siva called Yāma, then undergo tor ments inflicted by Kalabhairava for thirty thousand years, are then born as mortal men, then die in Kāśi and secure release (from samsāra) at the end. 

It is remarkable that the Kāśikhanda 1467 states that a little to the north of Kāśi, Visņu assigned a place for his resid ence called Dharmakṣetra and that there Visnu assumed the form of Buddha. This is a clear reference to Sārnath about five miles by road to the north of Banaras, where Buddha delivered his first sermon. The general rule for ascetics is that for eight months they must move from place to place and may spend the four months of the rainy season or two months in one place; but this rule is abrogated where ascetics enter Banaras and it is laid down that they should not leave Kāśi at all. 1467a 

The Kāśikhanda remarks For devotees of Siva who are full of faith there is, even in great calamities, no other remedy except the water of the feet of the image of God. Incurable diseases even, whether affecting the body outside or inside, are got rid of by the touch with faith of the water of (washing the image of) the deity.' This reminds one of the miraculous cures believed to have been effected by the water of a pool at Lourdes in the first years of this century 14676. 

It would be far beyond the scope of this section to dilate upon the great traditions of learning associated with the name of Banaras. It is sufficient to refer to Alberuni (vol. I. p. 173) who observed that Banaras and Kashmir were the

CHAPTER XIV 

GAYA 

Gayā occupies a unique place in the hearts of all pious Hindus even in these days. Hundreds of pages have been written about the history, the antiquities, the architectural remains of Gayā, the sacred places in and round about Gayā, the śrāddha rites performed in Gayā and about Gayāwals (the priests of Gayā). It is not possible to deal with this vast mass in this work. But it is impossible not to say a few words about the many conflicting views on certain important matters put forward by scholars for about three quarters of a century. Those who are deeply interested in the history and antiquities of Gaya should carefully read the following books and papers; Dr. Rajendralal Mitra's 'Buddha-Gaya' with 51 plates (1878); General Cunningham's ‘Mahābodhi' with 31 plates at the end (1892); L.S.S. O'Malley's District Gazetteer of Gayā, vol. XII and J.A.S.B. for 1903 LXXII, No. 3, pp. 1-11 on 'Gayāśrāddha and Gayāvals;' Indian Antiquary, vol. X pp. 339-340 for a Chinese Inscription at Buddha Gayā dated in a Chinese date corresponding to 1033 A, D, and pp. 341-347 for Inscriptions at Gayā, one of which is engraved in a temple of the Sun near a tank 'Daksinamānasa' near the Visnupada, dated 1813 years after Buddha's Parinirvāņa; Indian Antiquary, vol. 16 pp. 63 ff Inscription of Yakṣapāla, son of Viśvāditya, which records the building of a temple for certain images in the 15th regnal year of the Pāla king Nayapāladeva who died in 1045 A, D., edited by Kielhorn; Dr. Benimadhav Barua's 'Gayā and Buddha Gayā' in two volumes (1934) with plates; Journal of Bihar and Orissa R. Society, vol. 24 (for 1938) pp. 89-111 where Dr.J.C. Ghose deals with the antiquity of Gayā.' Some of the remarks of Dr. Ghose are most unwarranted and cannot be accepted, such as holding 'maganda' in 'Pramagandasya' in Rg. III. 53.14 as identical with Magadha and the explanation of 'udantyāh'in the Ait. Br. as 'people of sunrise.' Among medieval digests Gayā is dealt with in Kalpataru on Tirthas pp. 163-174, Tyrblade cintāmani of Vācaspati pp. 268-328, Tristhalīsetu of Narayana ) bhatta pp. 316-379, Tirthaprakāśa pp. 384-452, Tirthendi, sekhara pp. 54–59, Triṣthalisetu-sāra-sangraha of Bhattojin pp. 36-38.

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

The most important work on Gayā relied upon in such works as the Tristhali-setu and in modern times is the Gayā māhātmya that occurs at the end of the Vayupurāņa (chapters 105-112 of the Anandāśrama ed.). Scholars, differ about the antiquity of these chapters. Rajendralal Mitra assigned the Gayā-māhātmya to the 3rd or 4th century A, D. O'Malley was inclined to hold that the legend of Gayasura was invented in the 14th or 15th century, principally on the ground that the Gayāwals profess the Vaisnava faith established by Madhva cārya 1468 and acknowledge as their spiritual head the mahant of Hari Narasimhapura; vide J. A. S. B. vol. LXXII (1903) p. 4. To my mind there is hardly anything in this. The Gayāwals are notorious for their indolence, dissoluteness and ignorance and they are a dying race. O'Malley himself notes in the paper mentioned above (at p. 8) that originally the families of Gayāwals were 1484, that in Buchanan Hamilton's time they numbered about 1000, that in 1893 a Gayāwal counted 128 families, that in the census of 1901 there existed only 168 males (as pure Gayāwals) and 153 females. Gayā is a place sacred to Visnu and if the Gayāwals had to turn in medieval times for support to some great ācārya they would naturally choose to align themselves with the Vaisnava ācārya Madhya rather than with Sankara. Dr. Barua, after an elaborate exami nation of the several items of evidence, holds that the Gaya māhātmya is not earlier than the 13th or 14th century A. D. (vo]. I. p. 64 of 'Gayā and Buddha Gaya'). From considerations of the space at my disposal I cannot examine in detail his argu ments. His conclusion is vitiated mainly for two reasons. He relies too much on the dubious and unconvincing argument from silence. He examines the account of Gayā that appears in the Vanaparva and compares it with the fuller account in the Gayāmāhātmya and arrives at the rather startling conclusion "The Gayā proper as known to the Epic (the Mahābhārata) is essentially a place sacred to Yama Dharmarāja, Brahmā and Sivasūlin, and Visnu and Vaisna vism has no place in it either as a name or as an idea. Except 

1468. There is conflict about the dates of Madhvācārya's birth and death. The Uttaradi-matha records give sake 1040 (1118 A. D.) and sake 1120 (1198 A. D.) as the dates of his birth and death respectively. This is said to conflict with the date given in Madhva's महाभारततात्पर्यनिर्णय vi, that he was born in Tanio 4300. In a paper published in the Journal of the Annamalai University, vol. III for 1934 pp. 245 ff. the correct dates are said to be 1238 A.D.-1317 A, D.

Dr. Barua on Gayāmāhātmya 

645 

Brahmayüpa, Sivalinga and Vrsabha there is no refe rence to any structural erection nor any iconic suggestion'. In order to show how this conclusion is not at all justified the references to Gayā in the Epic and other Sanskrit works will have to be set out and compared with each other and with the Gayāmāhātmya. The second reason that vitiates Dr. Barua's conclusion is the wrong interpretation that he puts on verse 12 of the Inscription edited by Kielhorn in I. A. vol. 16. 

I shall now turn to the name Gayā and references to it or similar names from the Rgveda downwards. A Gaya, son of Plati, is the reputed author of two hymns of the Rgveda (X. 63 and X. 64). In Rg. X. 63. 17 and X. 64. 17 we have the words 'astāvi jano divyo Gayena' (the divine host was praised by Gaya). So Gaya was a proper name applied to a composer of Rgvedic hymns. In the Rg. the word Gaya has several other senses, which are not material here. In the Atharvaveda (I. 14.4) Gaya appears to be a wond 

appears to be a wonder-worker or a sorcerer along with Asita and Kaśyapa. Even in the Vedic Samhitās Asuras, Dāsas and Rākṣasas are credited with tricks and magic. Vide Rg. VII 99.4, VII, 104.24-25 and Atharva IV. 23.5. It is not difficult to imagine how a sorcerer Gaya could have been transformed into Gayāsura later on. Proceeding further, the Nirukta 1469 while explaining 'idam Visnur-vi cakrame tredhā nidadhe padam' (Rg. I. 22. 17) gives two very interesting interpretations, one explaining the verse as a natural phenomenon and the other explaining it from geographical or legendary points of view "He (Visņu) puts down his foot in three ways. According to Sākapūņi, Vispu plants his foot on the earth, in mid air (sky) and heaven; according to Aurņavābha, on Samārohana, on Viṣnu pada and on Gayasiras.' Whatever the Vedic verse may mean, it is clear that two interpretations had arisen several centuries before Christ and if the usual dates about Buddha's nirvāna are accepted Aurpavābha and Yāska both flourished before Buddha. Vide S. B. E. vol. XIII pp. XXII-XXIII for Buddha's nirvāņa being placed at 483 B. C. according to Ceylonese chronicle, while some western scholars would place it between 429-400 B. C. 1470 Gayasiras is named in the Vanaparva (87.

B. E. vol. XIII p. 134) in which last it is said that after having dwelt at Uruvela, Buddha accom - panied by a thousand bhikkhus went to Gayāsīsa (which is the Pali equivalent of Gayāśirsa). Traditions of Gaya as a king of the territories round about Gayā are mentioned in Jaina and Buddhist works. The Uttarādhyayanasūtra (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 86 and note 3 there) states that he was son of king Samudravijaya of Rājagrha and became the 11th Cakravartin. The Buddhacarita of Ašvaghosa states that Buddha visited the hermitage called a city of the royal sage Gaya, that the saint (future Buddha) fixed his dwelling on the pure bank of the Nairanjanā river (S. B. E. vol. 49 part 1 p. 132, Canto XIT. 87-88) and p. 193 (chap. XVII. 8 of the same work) and that Buddha went to the hermitage of Kāśyapa at Gayā called Uruvilvā. The same work (S. B. E. vol. 49 part 1 p. 192) speaks of Dharmātavi where dwelt 700 ascetics whom Buddha helped to enter nirvāna. Viṣnupada occurs in the Viṣnudharmasūtra 85.40 as a holy place very fit for śrāddha. In my opinion at least Aurnavābha held that in a particular region there were three places on which according to the legends current in his day the foot-prints of Visnu's foot could be seen 1971. Two of 

(Continued from last page) Sanskrit literature by Winternitz, vol. I p. 69(English tr.). Scholars are not agreed about the exact location and extent of Gayasiras. Rajendralal in 'Buddha-gayā' p. 19 says 'Gayasiras is not the Brahmayoni hill but a low spur of it to the north-east about a mile in area forming the site of the old town of Gayā. This Gayāsiras is the most sacred spot in Gayā.' Dr. Barua (vol. I. p. 246) 'Gayā proper is still sandwiched between the Phalgu and a small set of hills containing some 25 hill-tops with Gayasira or Gayasira (Brahma yoni) in the south-west &c.'. Both are, however, agreed that Gayasiras is part of the ancient Gayā region. Vide S. B. E vol. XIII. p. 134 n. 1 about Cunnigham's view that Tyr TH is the tra hill near Gayā. !. 

1471. I am not unmindful of the fact that in the Iron Pillar Inscrip tion of a king called Candra at Meherauli (nine miles south of Delhi) the last verse reads तेनायं प्रणिधाय भूमिपतिना ... मांशुर्विष्णुपदे गिरी भगवतो विष्णोर्ध्वज: Fatica:' (Gupta Inscriptions, No 32 at p. 141). This shows that near Delhi there was a hill called facute. But there is nothing to show that there was sie a place called TÍCH near it. Hence facute and T T being taken bob together point out to Gayā. The Inscription is undated but looking to be characters it would not be far wrong to assign it to a period near Samudra

Viṣnupada and Gayasiras

these, Visņupada and Gayasiras are well-known; hence it would not be unreasonable to hold that "Samārohana' is a place and has to be located somewhere near the other two. Samārohana means 'mounting up' or 'ascending'. This word probably refers to the ascent of the hill that rises up from the river Phalgu. It is also possible that it is the same as the Udyanta hill echoing with the warbling (of birds). 1472 I therefore hold that at least 600 years before Christ (and hence even before Buddha) there was a tradition about Visnu's footprints in at least two well-known places viz. Vispupada and Gaya-siras (both in Gayā). Even if some other work does not mention any one of these it does not follow from mere non-mention that that spot was not so named or did not exist. 

Let us now turn to the Vanaparva. Dr. Barua mainly relies on Vanaparva 84. 82-103 and 95. 9–29. But some preliminary remarks must be made before the two passages are examined. 

The Nāradiyapurāṇa (uttara, 46. 16) states that Gayasiras extends from Krauñcapada to Phalgutirtha. 

Vanaparva chapter 82 sets out Pulastya's replies to Bhīṣma's question about tirthas. First comes Puskara (verses 20-40), then Jambumārga, Tandulikāśrama, Agastyasaraḥ, Mahākāla, Kotitirtha, Bhadravata (Sthānutirtha), Narmadā, Prabhāsa and several other tirthas (not in any particular order but selected at random). In chap. 83 Kuruksetra is described at some length. 

Before discussing the most important passage of the Vana parva (viz. 84, 82-103) we must see what precedes the descrip tion of Gayā. Dr. Barua and many of those that have written on this passage have not carefully considered the implications of verses 1-81 of chapter 84 and also of the following chapters. In Vanaparva 84. 1-81 the author makes Dhaumya name 

(Continued from last page) gupta. Therefore Visnu's footprint existed on a hill near Delhi in the 4th century A. D. There is no sound reason advanced why it could not have existed at Gayā about the same time or even earlier, Besides in the Rām. 11.68.19 a विष्णुपद south of the river विपाशा is mentioned. 

1472. Dr. Barua regards ataarea in Vanaparva 84.93 as the name of a peak (vol. I. p. 246). But this appears to be wrong. It is an adjective 

POONA of gera (ud) that immediately precedes. I have not come across any pleak called aftaarea in any other work and Dr. Barua does not cite any other text in support of his view. ara would mean the hill of sunrise, lengt necessarily for the whole of Aryāvarta but in the place where both Tasuvad and Tota were situated.

about 57 holy places (including such famous ones as Naimisa, Sakambhari, Gangadvara, Kanakhala, the confluence of Ganga and Yamunā, Kubjāmraka) and then comes to speak of the sacred spots in Gayā.1473 It is therefore clear that the intention of the author is not to speak exhaustively about any tirtha, For this reason some tirthas are described twice in the Vana parva. For example Naimisa is very highly praised in chap.84. 59-64 and again in chap. 87. 6-7. The same happens with re gard to Gaya in 85.82-103 and 87.8-12.We cannot at all presume

There is hardly ar doubt that one borrows from the other. Good groun is have been advanced by Mr. M. V.

Sacred spots in Gayā and Vanaparva 

649 

from the manner in which tirthas in Gayā are named and des cribed that the writer of Vanaparva (chap. 84. 82-103) meant to be exhaustive as regards the holy spots in Gayā or the legends about Gayā. This conclusion is very much strengthened by the fact that in the Anušāsanaparva three sacred spots in Gayā are mentioned which do not occur in Vanaparva 84. 82-103 viz. 'In Gayā a man becomes purified in Asmaprstha (the same as Pretaśilā), on the hill Niravinda and of even a third brāhmana murder in Krauñcapadi',1474 These three, Aśmaprstha, Nira vinda and Krauñcapadi, are in addition to those sacred spots that are mentioned in Vanaparva 84. In Vāyu 109.15 a hill Aravindaka is said to be a peak of the Silāparvata and Nāradīya (uttara 47.83), Vāyu 108.75 and Nāradiya ('uttara 46.16) men tion the hill Krauñcapada (Munda-prstha was so called). There fore it is clear that three important sites in the Gayāmāhātmya are mentioned by the Anušāsanaparva. 

It was unfortunate that Dr. Barua confined his attention on the question of the antiquity of Gayā to merely three works viz. the Vanaparva chapters 84 and 95, the Agnipurāņa chap. 114-116 and the Vāyupurāņa chapters 105-112. He did not care to investigate all the other Purānas nor did it strike him that the explanation of three padas of Visnu furnished by Aurnavābha probably referred to spots around Gayā alone. Other Puranas such as Padma (Adikhanda 38.2-21), Garuda I chapters 82-86, and the Nāradiya (uttara chap. 44-47) contain much that concerns Gayā and all of them have many verses in common. The critical edition of the Mahābhārata (published by the B.O.R.I., Poona) reads 'sāvitram padam' (chap. 82.81) for *sávitryāstu padam' of the Bombay edition. The reading of the critical edition is supported by numerous and ancient Mss. Further, the printed Padmapurāṇa in Adikhanda 38. 13) reads 'Sāvitram padam' and thus lends support to the reading adopted in the critical edition. The words 'sāvitram padam' may be taken to mean the foot-print of Visņu (Savitr). Dr. Barua goes very much further than the facts warrant when he says that there is no reference in the Vanaparva to any struc tural erection or iconic suggestion. It is clear that there must have been an image of Dharma, since the Vanaparva speaks of

the pilgrim to Gayā having to touch Dharma (Dharmam tatrā - bhi-samsprśya). Besides, there is a reference to the footprints of a cow with a calf and to "Sāvitra pada'. All these would surely be things that have an 'iconic suggestion'. Moreover, Dr. Barua forgets for the moment that, according to the Chinese traveller Fa Hien who visited India between 399-413 A.D., the Gayā of the Hindu faith was 'all emptiness and desolation' (vide Legge's translation p. 87). It is possible that Gayā might have suffered from earthquakes before 400 A, D. (as it is a region that is liable to severe earthquakes even in modern times) and therefore no structural erection of the ancient city of Gaya (to which ancient Pali works and the Lalitavistara p. 311 refer) might have been left in Fa Hien's day. Gayā appears to have passed through several vicissitudes, Some centuries before the Christian era it was in existence and was a flourishing town. By 400 A, D. it had been reduced to desolation. But in the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang notes that the Hindu Gayā was a town with 1000 brāhmana families (vide Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II p. 113). Later on when Buddhism waned and vanished, Gayā came to comprehend even Buddhist remnants, since the Vāyupurāṇa speaks of Gayā as extending from Pretaśilā to Mahābodhi tree (a distance of about 13 miles, according to Mitra p. 19). 

Dr. Barua has also misunderstood verse 12 of the inscrip tion at Gayā edited by Dr. Kielhorn in I. A, vol. 16 p. 63 ff. The verse1475 set out below may be translated as follows: That wise (prince Yakṣapāla) caused to be constructed a temple for the images of Maunāditya and the other gods (mentioned in it), he dug up the famous Uttaramānasa lake and esta blished a sattra (charity house for food) near the Akṣaya (vata)'. This inscription of the reign of Nayapāla was

Kielhorn translated this wise (prince) caused to be built a temple of the inhabitants of heaven called Maunaditya...He likewise had the famous Uttaramānasa tank dug and established a sattra (hall of charity) to last forever', Dr. Kielhorn is wrong in his translation 'to last forever.' Dr. Barua read the as one word and connects that one word with ferarei (vol. I. p. 62n). OPED to understand how fauci (genitive plural) is to be construed with PARTE which according to Dr. Barua's construction is only part of a compound word.

engraved about 1040 A.D. Dr. Barua thought that Uttaramānas a was dug up at that time and therefore Uttaramānasa tank is taken to be not older than 1040 A. D. and that it and many of the sacred spots must have been later and the Gaya māhātmya which speaks of Uttarmānasa must be much later than the 11th century A. D. But Dr. Barua is entirely mistaken in this. If a tank was dug up for the first time at the time of the inscription, it is impossible that it should have been called 'khyāta' (famous). The tank can become famous some centuries after it was dug. Uttarmānasa tank is mentioned as a sacred spot in Vāyupurana 77. 108 (which verse is quoted about 1110 A.D. in the Kalpataru on tirtha at p. 168), Vāyu 82.21, Agni 115. 10. Therefore Uttaramānasa tank was well known at least in the 8th or 9th century A.D. What the inscription means is either that the famous tank had silted up and so it was dug up or that it was made longer, broader and deeper in about 1040. 

That is all. 

In my opinion the Gayāmāhātmya (Vāyu, chap. 105-112), though possibly later than the main text of the Vāyupurāṇa, cannot be placed so late as the 13th or 14th century A. D. It is really a patch-work from many sources of earlier times such as the Vanaparva, Anušāsanaparva, Padma I. 38, the Nāradiya (uttara) chap. 44-47. Several verses and half verses of it are repetitions (such as the half verse 'Gayāyām akṣayam śrāddham japahomatapāmsi ca' Vāyu 108. 35 and Vāyu 82.43 quoted as from Vāyu in Kalpataru on tīrtha p. 167, and Vāyu 110. 29-30 are the same as Vāyu 105.37-38. So also Vāyu 82, 31-33 are the same as Vāyu 110.51-53. Dr. Barua does not notice that in chap. 82 of the Vāyu (20-24) several sub-tirthas of Gayā are ex pressly mentioned viz. Brahmakunda, Prabhāsa, Pretaparvata, Uttaramānasa, Udīcī, Kanakhala, Dakṣiņamānasa, Dharm āraṇya, Gadādhara, Matanga; so also chap. 77.97–108 mention Gțdhrakūța, hermitage of Bharata, Matangapada, Munda prstha and Uttaramānasa.

(about 1150-1225 A. D.) on Srāddha and Asauca (without name) as briefly exemplified below. I think that the Gayamāhātmya is to be assigned to some date between the 7th and 10th centuries A.D. 

Having disposed of the question of the date of the Gayā. māhātmya and the references to the sacred spots in Gayā in Vanaparva chap. 84, it is necessary to see how Gayā is spoken of in the other parts of the Mahabhārata and the smrtis. In the Vanaparva itself references to Gayā occur in chap. 87 and chap. 95. Vanaparva, chap. 87, starts by saying that going towards the east (from Kāmyaka-vana where the Pandavas dwelt for some time) the pilgrim would come to the Naimiņa forest and the Gomati river. Thus it is said that in the east there is a holy hill called after Gaya and a holy pool called Brahmasaras; then comes a famous verse 1477 'one should desire to have many sons if even

The Face (University of Mysore edition) on 3113117 has towards the end a section on 9garu, several verses of which occur in arg. A few verses are cited by way of illustration. The first two verses (fraz. p. 194 ) though ascribed to 311gt are almost the same as aty 110.2-3; the verses गोप्रचार...बभूव (in स्मृतिच. on आशौच p.199) are almost the same as art. 111. 35 and 37; g. p. 197 the verse Ani qara is the same as वायु 105.48 and स्मृतिच. p. 199 the verse या सा वैतरणी नाम is वायु 10544. 

The Tirtha-cintamani of Vācaspati quotes many verses from the Gaya mahatmya of the Vayupurāṇa. Vācaspati's literary activity lies between 1450 to 1480 (or 1500 AD at the latest). He treats the Gayāmāhātmya as on the same level as the other purāṇas. This position could not have been attained by the Gayāmahatmya in a century or two. Therefore it must be much earlier than 1300 AD: A few examples of the citations of the Gayamahātmya by Vacaspati may be indicated here. On pp, 285-286 the तीर्थचि. expressly quotes from the वायव्य verses 18, 19,26of वायु. 105%; वायु. 110. 2-3 are quoted as from aro in a fa. p. 7; on pp. 280-283 numerous verses are quoted from argyros which are (with slight variations) the same as argrOT 108. 13-23, 28-30; on pp. 284-285 from argu are cited arzo 110. 9-15 and 19-20, 56-59; aler. pp. 288-293 quote from the aircror 110. 17, 21-24, 30-32, 34-55; atura, pp. 298-301 quote arg. 111. 1-22 (with additions and variant readings): similarly the yaanziqe on I and FUGIHT quote about 300 verses from 7TATERFT and the farmere (pp. 356-359 &c.), several times refers to the explanations of verses from 777FATETIT given by his predecessors.

one (of whom ) goes to Gayā, or performs the Aśvamedha sacri fice or lets loose a nila bull' (the pitrs may be gratified ). Then Vanaparva chap. 87 goes on to refer to the holy river (mahā nadi) Phalgu, the hill Gayaśiras, the Akṣayya Vata, where food offered to pitrs becomes inexhaustible. In Vanaparva 95 men tion is made of Brahmasaras (where Agastya went to Dharma rāja i. e. Yama, verse 12), of Akṣayavata (v. 14) which is an imperishable place of worship and where the fruit (of offerings made ) is inexhaustible; it further states that king Gaya, son of Amūrtarayas, 1477a performed a sacrifice in which food and fees in plenty were distributed (verses 18-19). Vas. (XI. 42) states: when a man goes to Gayā and offers food his ancestors become delighted like agriculturists that rejoice when there is good rain and pitrs become (really) putrin (having a son) on account of such a son. The Viṣnudharmasutra, chapter 85, 1478 mentions by name about 55 holy places that are most proper for sraddha among which those connected with Gayā are Gayāsirṣa, Akṣaya vata, Phalgu, Uttaramānasa, Matangavāpi, Visnupada, and winds up by quoting three verses as gāthās sung by pitrs. Yāj. I. 261 states that whatever a man gives while in Gayā leads to inexhaustible rewards. Atri-smrti (55-58) refers to a son's going to Gayā for the benefit of the pitrs, to a bath in Phalgu and tarpaņa of pitrs in the river, to seeing Gadādhara (Vispu) at Gayā and to Gayāsīrṣā. Sankha (14. 27-28) refers 1479 to several tirthas (one being Gayā) the offerings made at which

become inexhaustible. The Likhita-Smrti speaks 1480 of the importance of Gayā as follows: In whosesoever name a pinda is offered at Gayāśiras, whether for oneslf or for another, that person, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven that man secures release (from samsāra). The Kūrmapurāņa remarks that one should desire to have many sons so that if one out of them goes to Gayā on some other business and offers śrāddha, he thereby saves his pitrs and himself reaches the highest goal. The Matsyapurana (22. 4-6) quoted by the Kalpataru (on tirtha p. 163) speaks of Gayā as pitrtirtha and as the best among tīrthas where Brahmā himself dwells and also has the verse 'estavyā bahavaḥ putrāḥ'. 

In the Gayāmāhātmya (Vāyupurāṇa, chapters 105-112) there are about 560 verses. An attempt will be made here to give a brief summary of it and some of the important verses will be quoted. Chapter 105 is general and briefly indicates some of the main topics dealt with in the following chapters. It states that in Svetavārāhakalpa Gaya performed a sacrifice and Gayā was named after him 1481, that pitrs hanker after sons because the son that goes to Gayā saves the pitrs from hell 1482. At Gayā a man should offer pindas to his father and others and even to himself but without sesame; all the five mortal sins like brāhmaṇa-murder are removed by the perfor mance of śrāddha at Gayā. A pinda offered after uttering the name and gotra of the recipient by the son or any other person in Gayā leads that person to the imperishable brahma 1483, Moksa is fourfold (i. e. results in four ways) viz. by knowledge of brahma, śrāddha at Gayā, death in a fight for preventing) the seizure of cows and residence in Kuruksetra and śrāddha at

Śrāddha at Gayā 

655 

Gayā renders the others unnecessary 1484 Śrāddha may be performed at Gayā at all times, even in an intercalary month, on the anniversary of one's birthday, or even when Jupiter and Venus are invisible or when Jupiter is in Leo. One should honour the brāhmanas (of Gayā) that were established there by Brahmā; when they are gratified all deities together with the pitrs are gratified. Tonsure 1485 and fast are to be observed at all tirthas except in Kuruksetra, Viśālā, Virajā and Gayā. An ascetic 1486 (sannyāsin) should not offer pindas (at Gaya) but should merely exhibit (hold up) his staff and should put it down on Viṣnupada. The (whole) Gayāksetra is five krośas in extent and Gayāśiras is one krośa and all the tirthas of the three worlds are centered in these two 1487. At Gayā one may offer (to pitrs) pindas by means of pāyasa (rice cooked in milk), boiled rice, barley flour, fruits and roots, the cake of sesame (after oil is extracted), sweetmeats or jag gery with ghee or with curds alone or with invigorating honey. In a śrāddha at Gayā, the procedure consists in pre paring 1488 a seat for the pipdas, the offering of pindas, the sprinkling of water again (on the kusa grass), giving fees and declaration of dinner (to brāhmanas); but there is no invoca tion of pitrs, no curtains for privacy and no blemish due to śrāddha being seen (by undesirable persons or animals). Those who desire to reap the full fruit of śrāddha performed at a tirtha (like Gayā) must give up passionate longings, anger and

gave her in marriage to Marici, who took her to his hermitage and had one hundred sons from her. Once Marici being tired lay down for sleep and asked Dharmavratā to shampoo his feet, While she shampooed his feet Brahmā (her father-in-law) came there. She left off shampooing her husband's feet and got up to receive with honour her husband's father. In the meanwhile Marici awoke and not seeing his wife cursed her to be a sila (stone slab) as she disobeyed his order by giving up the sham pooing of his feet. She being innocent of any fault got angry and was about to curse Marici but said “Mahādeva will curse you'. She, standing in the midst of Gārhapatya fire, performed tapas and Marici also did the same. The gods led by Indra got anxious as usual and went to Visnu who asked her to choose a boon. She prayed that the curse pronounced by her husband be annulled. The gods said that Marici being a great sage the curse could not be annulled and asked her to choose some other boon. She said that she should be a sila more holy than all rivers, sages and gods and that all tirthas should stand in the slab of stone, that those who would bathe in the tirthas on the silā and offer pindas and grāddha should be able to go to brahmaloka, that all holy rivers like the Ganges should always remain in her. The gods conceded what she prayed for and said that when she would become stable on the head of Gayāsura, they would all stand on the silā. 

Chap. 108 presents numerous divergences in the Mss. In the Anandāśrama edition its contents briefly are: The sila was placed on the head of Gayāsura and therefore there was union of two very holy objects, on which Brahmā performed Ašvamedha and when the gods came to receive their share of the sacrificial offerings the silā said to Viṣnu and others 'pro mise that you would remain on the silā and would bring about the release of pitrs'. The gods agreed and they stayed on the silā in the form of images and foot-prints. As the silā was placed on the back of the head of the asura the hill was called Mundaprstha (lit. the back of the head) which gave Brahma loka to pitrs. Then the chapter speaks of a hill called Pra bhāsa, of Rāmatirtha near the place where the great river (Phalgu) and Prabhāsa hill meet, the hermitage of Bharata, of Matangapada, of the bali to be offered to Yamarāja and Dharmaste rāja and to the dogs of Yama, viz.

Story of Gayasura 

659 mitage of Cyavana, the river Punaḥpunā, Krauñca-pada, Janārdana on Bhasmakūta. 

The story of Gayāsura has puzzled Mitra and subsequent writers. Mitra holds that nothing appears more absurd or stupid than the story of Gayāsura who, he emphasizes, is not a demon or a vicious monster, but a devout Vaisnava ('Bodh Gaya' pp. 15-16). The story of Gayāsura is not unique. The Purānas abound in stories that appear to modern minds absurd and puerile. Besides, there were several asuras like Prahlāda, Bāņa (devotee of Siva) and Bali (who was an exemplary and pious king and a worshipper of Visnu ) that were not monsters but good and devout persons, and yet fought with gods. For ex ample, Kūrmapurāņa (I. 16. 59-60 and 91-92) narrates that Prahlāda fought with Nrsimha; the Padma (Bhumikhanda 1.8) calls him a Mahābhāgavata but states that he first fought with Visnu and entered Vaisnavītanu; while Vāmanapurana (chap. 7-8) speaks of his fight with Naranārāyana. In Pali works (e. g. Anguttara-nikāya, part IV pp. 197-204) he is called Pahārāda and asurinda (asurendra). Vide Anguttara-nikāya (text) vol. IV p. 197. For Bali who was grandson of Prahlāda, a good king and a devotee of Viṣnu, vide Brahmapurāņa, chap. 73, Kurma I. 17, Vāmana (chapters 77 and 92), For Bāna, son of Bali and the fight of Bāņa helped by Siva with Krsna, vide Brahma chap. 205-206 and Visnupurāņa V. 33. 37–38. 

According to Dr. Rajendralal Mitra (in 'Bodh-Gaya' pp. 14. 18) the story of Gayasura is an allegory of the vanquishing of Buddhism by Brahmanism. O'Malley thought (J. A. S. B. vol. LXXII part 3 p. 7 for 1904) that the Gayāsura legend represents an amalgamation or compromise of Brahmanism with the popular demonolatry which preceded Brahmanism, Dr. Barua critisizes both theories and appears to hold (vol. I. pp. 40-41) that the idea underlying the legend is to impress on people's minds the high sanctity of the Gayā range of hills along the western bank of the river Phalgu, that Gayā figures nowhere in Buddhism, that Gaya 1492 or Namuci or Vrtra is represented as a demon of darkness and as an enemy of Indra and that the Vedic word Trivikrarna and the interpretation of Aurnavābha are the nucleus of the legend of Gayasura. From considerations of space it is not possible to discuss these

1492. It is not clear whence Dr. Barua derived his information than in the Veda Gaya is represented as a demon like Vitra. In the R adiate Gaya is not a demon like Vytra.

theories here. To my mind it appears that Gayā had become a famous pitrtartha centuries before Christ and that the legend of Gayāsura is a post facto attempt to account for the sanctity of the place and the numerous shrines and holy places that had sprung up round Gayā. 

Chap. 109 deals with the questions how Adi-Gadādhara abided in manifest and unmanifest forms, how his gadā (mace) was produced and how the tirtha called Gadalola became a destroyer of all sins. There was a powerful Asura called Gada, who, when Brahmā. requested, gave up his bones to Brahmā. Višvakarmā, at the desire of Brahmā, fashioned a wonderful mace out of the bones. In the times of Svāyambhuva Manu an Asura named Heti, son of Brahmā, performed severe austerities for thousands of divine years. He secured from Brahma and other gods the boon that he could not be killed by gods, daityas, men or with such weapons as the discus of Krsna and others. Heti conquered the gods and became Indra. The gods went to Hari and requested him to kill Heti. He asked for a powerful weapon and the gods gave him the mace manufactured from the bones of Gada and Visnu killed Heti with the Gada. This story about demon Heti is mentioned in Agni 114. 26-27 and Nāradiya (uttara) 47. 9-11. Hari is called Adi-Gadadhara because 1492a he was the first to wield that mace and stood on the silā on the head of Gayāsura, supported by the Gadā, in order to make (the head of Gayāsura) stable. He shows himself in the form of hills viz. the Mundaprstha hill, the Prabhāsa and other hills. These and Aksayavata, Phalgu and other rivers are the non-manifest forms of Ādigadādhara. The Vispupada, Rudrapada, Brahma pada and other padas are the non-manifest and manifest forms of Gadādhara. 1493 The image of Gadā dhara is purely a mani

fest form. Asura Heti was killed by Visnu and went to Visnu loka. When the body of Gayāsura was made stable Brahmā sang a hymn of praise to Visnu who asked Brahma to choose a boon. Brahmā said 'we (gods) shall not abide in the silā with out you, but shall remain therein together with you if you have a manifest form.' 1494 Visnu said 'be it so' and Visnu stood on Gayāśiras in the Adigadādhara form and as Janārdana and Pupdarikākṣa. Siva also praised Viṣnu (Vāyu 109. 43-50). The Vāyu speaks at several places of 'vyaktāvyakta' symbols of the deity (chap. 109. 20 and 43-45). What is meant is Visnu is non-manifest in Phalgu, vyaktāvyakta in Visnupada and manifest in images and statues (vide Tristhalisetu p. 365, prati māsvarūpi vyaktaḥ). 

Chap. 110 deals with Gayāyātrā. To the east of Gaya is a great river (Phalgu).

In Astakās, in Vrddhisraddha, at Gayā and on the anniversary of death, one may offer a śrāddha separately to one's mother but on all other occasions with her husband.1495 To the sapindas other than one's paternal ancestors he should offer srāddha to the south (of the place where he offers to his father &c.) viz. should spread kusas and once offer water mixed with sesame and should offer them a pinda made of barley flour and repeat the mantras (Vāyu 110. 21-22). The pindas to be offered at Gayāśiras may be in size as 149 big as one's closed hand, or an undried amalaka (myrobalan) fruit or of the size of sami leaves. By means of these he saves seven gotras viz. that of his father, of his mother, of his wife, sister, daughter, paternal aunt and maternal aunt. Water mixed with sesame and pindas are offered to all persons on the maternal grandfather's side, to all bandhus, to all infants, to persons cremated or not cremated, to persons that were killed by lightning or robbers or that commit ted suicide in various ways and to those who may be undergo ing torments of Hells of various kinds and those who have become beasts or birds or insects or trees owing to evil deeds (Vāyu 110, verses 30-55). The verses of most comprehensive character about offering water have been cited in n. 1237 p. 550 and on pp. 616-617 above. 

Chap. 111 deals with the order in which the several tirthas are to be visited. The full pilgrimage lasts for geven days. In chap. 110 it has been stated as shown above that on entering Gayā, a pilgrim takes a bath in the Phalgu water, performs tarpana and sraddha, then on the same day he goes to the Pretašilā (which is a part of the Silā as stated in Vayu 108.15) and performs a śrāddha there and offers piņdas with boiled rice and ghee (Vāgu 110.15). - On doing

this the persons for whom this is done become free from the position of pretu. It is stated in Vāyu 108. 17–22) that one should bathe in the Rāmatirtha which is near the place where Phalgu meets the Prabhāsa hill. By bath in Rāmatirtha and offering of srāddha and pinda there the persons for whom this is done become pitrs (being already free from pretatva by the śrāddha on pretasila). On a hill on the south of Pretagilā one should offer a bali (food offered with kusa, sesame and water) to Yamarāja and Dharmaraja and to the two dogs Syāma and Sabala. On the next day after entering Gayā (i. e. the 2nd day), the pilgrim should proceed to the Pretaparvata 1497 (Vāyu 110,8) and take a bath in the Brahmakunda and perform tar pana, śrāddha and giving of pindas mixed with sesame, ghee, curds and honey to his ancestors (father, grandfather &c.) with the mantras "pitā pitāmahascaiva' (Vāyu 110. 23-24). Then the pilgrim should offer on kusas, water, sesame and pindas to persons related in various ways with the mantras 

asmat-kule mrtā ye ca &c., (Vāyu 110. 34-55). He should then invoke the gods to be witnesses to the fact of his having come to Gaya and become free from the debt to the ancestors (Vāyu 110. 59-60). It is stated in Vāyu 110,61 that at all sacred spots in Gayā the offering of pindas should be done in the same way as at Pretaparvata 1498. 

On the third day of entering Gaya one has to perform Pañcatirthi rites 1499 (Vāyu 111.1 ff.). The pilgrim first bathes in Uttaraniānasa, offers tarpaņa to gods, gives water and śrāddha and pindas to his ancestors with the mantras (Vāyu 110. 21-24). The fruit of this rite is the inexhaustible grati fication of the pit rs. Then the pilgrim goes to the three tirthas which constitute Dakṣinamānasa, viz.

(on the south). At each of these three there is a sraddha. Then the pilgrim goes to the Phalgutirtha, which is the best of all (Gayā) tirthas. The pilgrim performs tarpana and śrāddha with pindas on Phalgu. This śrāddha at Phalgu results in mukti for the performer and also for those for whose benefit it is performed (muktir-bhavati kartēnām pitrnām śrāddhataḥ sadā, Vāyu 110.13). It is stated that Phalgu is Ādi-Gadādhara himself in a fluid form.1500 By bath in Phalgu and seeing Gadādhara a man saves himself, ten ancestors and ten descend ants. Then he worships Gadādhara by a bath with pañcāmrla after bowing 1500a to Vasudeva, Sankarsana, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, Visņu, Sridhara. On the 2nd day of the Pañca tīrthi rites (i. e. 4th day from entering Gayā) the pilgrim should repair to Dharmāranya which is so-called because Dharma per formed a sacrifice there. Then the pilgrim should bathe in the Matangavāpi (which is situated in Dharmāranya), then he should perform tarpana, śrāddha and pindadāna at the well called Brahmatirtha and also in the space between Brahma tirtha and Brahmayūpa; then bow to Brahmā and Dharm eśvara. 1501 He should bow to the Mahābodhi tree (i. e. the sacred pippala) and perform srāddha also underneath it. Agni 115. 34-37 and Nāradīya (uttara) 45. 104 refer to these tirthas. On the third day of the Pañcatirthi rites (i. e. on 5th day from entering Gayā) the pilgrim should bathe in Brahmasaras and perform śrāddha with pindas between the Brahmaküpa and the Yüpa (sacrificial post ) raised by Brahmā when he performed a sacrifice. By this śrāddha the pilgrim saves his pitrs.1502 He should go round the Brahma-yüpa and bow

to Brahmā. There are mango trees near Gopracāra establish ed by Brahmā. By watering a mango with water from the Brahmasaras the pitrs attain moksa. Here follows the verse (“eko munih' &c.) quoted above (n. 1493). Then a bali should be offered to Yama and Dharmarāja, then to the two dogs of Yama, then he should offer a bali to crows and then bathe (in Brahmasaras). This is briefly a summary of Vāyu 111.30 40. Some of these details are mentioned by Agni 115, 34-40 and Nāradiya (uttara) 46. Then on the 4th day of the Pañca tirthi rites (i. e. 6th day from entrance into Gayā ) the pilgrim should take an ordinary bath in the Phalgu and should then perform śrāddhas at the several padas on Gayāśiras which is near Phalgutirtha, Gayāśiras extends from Krauñcapāda up to Phalgutirtha. Srāddha offered here (on Gayāśiras ) becomes inexhaustible.1503 Here Adi-Gadādhara abides in the form of Viṣnupada. By performing a śrāddha with pindas on Viṣnu pada (which is a footprint on a slab deemed to be of Viṣņu ) the pilgrim saves one thousand families and takes them and himself to the blissful, inexhaustible and never-ending world of Viṣnu. Then Vāyu 111. 47-56 deal with the rewards of śrāddhas performed at Rudrapada, Brahmapada and 14 other padas expressly named by it. 1504 ‘For whomsoever by name a pilgrim offers a pioda on Gayāśiras, that man, if in hell, goes to heaven and if in heaven he secures mokṣa.' 

On the 5th day of the Pañcatirthi rites (i. e. the 7th day from entering Gayā), the pilgrim should bathe in the sacred place called Gadālola, 1505 By performing srāddha with pindas at Gadālola he takes his pitrs and himself to the world of Brahmā. Then at the Akṣayavata he should perform a śrāddha

and honour the (Gayā) brāhmaṇas established by Brahmã with offerings and food. When they are gratified gods together with pitrs become gratified. 1506 Then the pilgrim should bow to the Akṣayavața and worship it with a mantra and also bow to worship Prapitāmaha. Agni 115. 69-73 and Nāradiya (uttara) chap. 47 also refer to these. 

The Tristhalisetu (p. 368) remarks that the above are the fixed rites for seven days in Gayā, that other tirthas may be visited according to one's convenience if one stays in Gayā for half a month or a month; that the śrāddha at the Pretašilā is to be the first and that at the Akṣayavața is to be performed at the end,1507 and that although there is variation between the order in which tīrthas are to be visited on the several days according to the Vāyupurāṇa, the Agnipurāṇa and other purāṇas, yet as the Vāyupurāṇa is most detailed as regards Gayā rites, the order therein should be followed and that one not knowing the order may visit the tirthas in any order 1508 except Pretasila and Aksayavata. Gayāyātrā, chapter 112 of the Vāyupurāṇa, refers to king Gaya who performed a yajña and who got two boons, one about the restoration of the Gayā brāhmaṇas to favour and the other that Gayāpuri be named after him and who then went to Visnuloka. Then it narrates the story of king Visāla (verses 7-15) who being sonless performed pindadāna on Gayāśīrsa and thereby saved his three ancestors, got a son and also himself went to heaven. Then another story is told (verses 16-20) of a deceased person, who was in the condition of a preta, offering one-sixth of his property to a trader and asking him to perform Gayāśrāddha with the rest of his wealth and who on account of śrāddha at Gayā became free from the condition of preta,1509 Then verses 20-60 mention several other tirthas of Gayā such as Gāyatritirtha, Prāci-sarasvatitirtha, Viśālā, Lelihāna, the

hermitage of Bharata, Mundaprstha, Akāśagangā, Vaitarani and other rivers and sacred places. It winds up by saying that six Gayās confer mukti (by worship and pindadāna at them) viz. Gayāgaja, Gayāditya, Gāyatri (tirtha), Gadādhara, Gayā and Gayāśiras.1509a 

The Agnipurāņa (chap. 116. 1-34) has a long list of tirthas at Gayā that is quoted by the Tristhaltsetu pp. 376-378, which are passed over here. 

Though the number of tirthas at Gaya is very large, the majority of pilgrims do not visit them all. Visits to three places are absolutely necessary for every pilgrim to Gayā, viz. Phalgu river, Visnupada and Akṣayavata, at all of which worship has to be done with milk, water, flowers, sandalwood paste, tāmbūla, lighted lamp and pindas to ancestors have to be offered. The Visnupada temple is built over the footprint of Vispu on the rock to the west of the river Phalgu. The old town of Gayā was built round Visnupada and it is the largest and most important temple in Gayā. The footprint (about 16 inches in length) deemed to be God Visnu's is inside an octa gonal basin plated with silver. Pilgrims of all castes (except untouchables) surround the basin and cast their offerings in side the basin, though for a substantial payment the priests clear out all people, shut the door for a minute or two and allow a very orthodox or a rich person to make his offerings without being disturbed by anyone else. There are 45 vedis (or sacred places) at which the leisured pilgrim may offer pindas in the Gayākṣetra which extends from about five miles to the north-west of Old Gayā town to about 7 miles south of it. Though the ancient Buddhist works and Fa Hien and Hiouen Thsang make a distinction between Gaya and Uruvilvā or Uruvelā where Buddha attained Enlightenment after six years of severe tapas, the Bodhi tree (Mahābodhitaru) was recognized by the Gayāmāhātmya as one of the sacred places which Hindu pilgrims should visit and is so regarded even now. When the Hindus appropriated Buddhist sacred places to themselves it is difficult to say. The Bodhi tree is the oldest historical tree in the world. A branch of it is said to have been transplanted to Ceylon in the times of the great Emperor Asoka (about 250 B.C.)

and at Kandy in Ceylon a pippala tree is even now shown as that transplanted tree or the successor of that branch. The Gayāśīrsa 1510 is a set of rocky hills such as Gayāšīrsa, Munda prstha, Prabhāsa, Grdhrakūta, Nāgaküța, ranging over one krośa (about two miles). 

It has been already stated above (p. 666) that the rites at the Akṣayavata are the last in the pilgrimage to Gayā. The Gayā wal priest binds the thumbs or hands of the pilgrim with a garland of flowers and receives his fees. He gives sweetmeats to the pilgrim as prasāda, applies tilaka to the pilgrim's forehead, . touches the pilgrim on his back, pronounces the word 'suphala' (the pilgrimage has been fruitful or successful), declares that the pilgrim's ancestors have gone to heaven and blesses the pilgrim. It must be noted that there is a special class of priests called Dhāmin, who alone (and not the ordinary Gayāwals) have the right of officiating at five vedis viz. at Pretasila, Rāmašilā, Rāmakunda, Brahmakunda and Kākabali, that are situated on or about the two hills Rāmašila and Pretašilā (vide Bengal District Gazetteers, vol. 12 for Gayā p. 66). They are regarded as inferior in status to the regular Gayāwals. 

One important question on which there is great divergence of views among the medieval digests is about the ancestors to whom śrāddha is to be offered at Gayā. In the Vayu and other Purāpas it is frequently said that he who performs srāddha at Gaya becomes free from the debt due to the pitrs 1511 or that what is offered to the pitrs at Gaya, Dharmaprstha, Brahma saras, or on the Gayasirsa and under the imperishable Vata tree becomes inexhaustible. In most of these passages the plural of the word 'pitr' is used. Therefore it follows that śrāddha is to be offered in Gayā to three paternal ancestors. And on account of a verse attributed to Gautama,1512 the three male maternal an cestors also are to be offered śrāddha. The difference arises with 

1510. Gayasiras and Gayā were according to Buddhist works well known places in Buddha's days. Vide the Mahavagga I. 21.1 (S. B. E. vol. 13 p. 134 ) cited above (on p. 646) and Anguttara Nikāya (text) vol. IV. p. 302 Fai war 141 Feria TITA.

Ancestors for whom Gaya-śrāddha is offered

reference to the wives of these six male paternal and maternal ancestors. The Agnipurāṇa proposes an option (115. 10) that the devatās in Gayasraddha are nine or twelve. When they are to be nine, the śrāddha is for three paternal ancestors, three male ancestors of the mother and the wives of the latter three male ancestors, while there is a separate śrāddha for the mother, paternal grand-mother and paternal great-grandmother. If there are to be twelve devatās in Gayāśrāddha, then all the wives of the paternal ancestors and of maternal ancestors would be included in one sraddha. Aparārka allowed an option (as in Agni) in Gayā-śrāddha. 1513. According to the Smrtyarthasāra 1514 and Hemādri the Anvastakā-śrāddha and Gayāśrāddha for the paternal ancestors and that for the wives of these (i. e, mother, paternal grandmother &c.) must always be separate, but the śrāddha for the mother's paternal ancestors and their wives should be one (and therefore the devatās will be nine). Yama (verse 80) appears to hold that the mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother are always to be associated with their respective husbands in śrāddha, Some held that the devatās of Gayāśrāddha were only six viz. the three male paternal ancestors and three male maternal ancestors.1515 The Tri. S. ultimately remarks that the usage of the country should be the deciding principle. The Prajāpati-smrti (183-184) has some rather contradictory views as to when there would be 12 or 9 or 6 devatās in a sraddha. When there are twelve devatās, the sankalpa at the Pretašila śrāddha which is the model of all the śrāddhas at the other sacred spots in Gayā (with suitable modifications) will be as noted below. 1516 

It should be noted that there are certain special charac teristics of Gayāśrāddha. There is no tonsure (Vāyu 83. 18

and note 1485 above). One must honour the Gayāwals alone, and not other brāhmaṇas, however learned they may be ; one should not consider the family or character or learning of Gayā brahmanas (vide p. 579 above and note 1313). But it has to be remembered that Narayanabhatta 1517 did not accept this for all śrāddhas t Gayā, but only as to the śrāddha under the Akṣaya vata, since the Vayu (111.79-80) again refers under Aksaya vața to the worship of Gayā brāhmaṇas and since following the maxim of 'caturdhakarana laid down in Jai. III. 1. 26-27 the later specific provision narrows down the wide words used in the earlier passage. At Gayā one could offer pinda to oneself but without sesame.1518 The Tri. S. (p. 350) observes (relying on Vāyu) that when a man offers a pinda to himself, it should be in the hands of the image of Janārdana on Bhasmakūta 1519 and that the pilgrim to Gayā can offer a pinda to himself only when it is certain that he has no son or other adhikārin for offering śrāddha. Further, any one related or unrelated, could offer a pinda 1520_to any body, as laid down in Vayu 'Whether it is one's own son or the son of another (who offers), in whosesoever name a pinda is let fall at Gayā, that man attains everlasting Brahma. It is desired that anyone may offer a piņda to anybody after uttering that person's name and gotra and the latter reaches the highest goal.' 

There are several works, printed and in mss., that deal with the procedure of Gayāśrāddha. There is the Gayāšrāddha-paddhati of Vācaspati printed at the Chandraprabha press, Benares city, the Tirtha-yatra-tattva of Raghunandana (which contains a Gaya

No. 93 of 1891-95) and the Gayāśrāddha-vidhi of Vācaspati (D. C. No, 245 of 1887-91). The procedure in the Tirthayātrā-tattva of Raghunandana is set out here briefly with out actually citing in full the Vāyupurāņa passages which it quotes profusely. Raghunandana appears to follow the Tirtha cintāmaņi closely as some of the notes will show. After the pilgrim enters Gayā he should first make an appropriate sankalpa1521 for a bath in Phalgu, take the clay from the river, apply it to his body and bathe. Then he should perform tarpana1522 to the twelve male and female ancestors (specified in note 1516 above). Then he should declare a sankalpa that he would per form Gayāśrāddha with the words 'Oml adyetyādi Gayātirtha prāpti-nimittaka-śrāddhamaham kariṣye'. Then he should per form a pārvana-śrāddha (described above pp. 485-505) excepting the āvāhana and arghya rites. If the pilgrim be unable to per form all the details of sraddha, he may offer only pindas. Then on the same day he should go to the Pretasilā which adjoins the west bank of the river Phalgu and is to the north of Gayā and perform śrāddha there as follows: he should perform the purification of the ground, sit down on it, perform ācamana, face the south, wear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, recite the verses (Vāyu 110. 10-12 'Kavyavālo...srāddhenānena śāśvatim), contemplate on his pitrs, perform prāņāyāma, sprinkle water on the materials for śrāddha after remembering Pundarikākṣa (Viṣnu), make the sankalpa (set out in note 1516). He should go through the whole procedure of śrāddha up to the payment of daksinā to brāhmaṇas. After this he should sit to the south of the altar (where he performed the śrāddha), should wear the sacred thread in the apasavya form, face the south, place on the ground three kuśas and after reciting the mantra (Vāyu 110. 10-12 ) should make an invocation once in the form of offering an anjali of water mixed with sesame, then honour the father with pūdya (water for washing the feet), recite the two verses

In this way he should offer pinda to the remaining eleven devatās, viz. paternal grandfather and others (or eight or five according to usage). He should donate a fee according to his means. Then he should sit to the south of the place he so far occupied, spread on the ground kusas having roots but with tips turned to the south, should repeat the mantras (Vāyu 110. 10-12), perform on those kušas once an invocation in the form of an añjali of water mixed with sesame, repeat the two verses (Vāyu 110. 22-23 Pitā pitāmaha...mupatisthatām' with om prefixed 1522a ) and should offer one pinda made of one handful of barley flour mixed with sesame, kušas, ghee, curds, water and honey to all the twelve devatās ( ancestors ) together. Then follows what is called Sodašīkarma, which is as follows: Nineteen spots for pindas should be made (each to the south of the preceding ) and should be smeared with pañcagavya one after another; then he should spread over each kušas with their tips to the south, shouid invoke on the kušas the persons intended with the mantras (Vāyu 110. 30-32 asmat-kule mrtā......tilodakaih '), should worship them by offering sandalwood paste and the rest, (and if he is performing the rite of sodaśī on a spot sacred to a specific deity then worship that deity also with an appropriate mantra), should then offer once as before an anjali of water mixed with sesame and offer pindas beginning from the first spot, each pinda being offered after reciting each of the 19 mantras (Vāyu 110, 34-55, omitting 110.44 'asipatra o’, 110.46 'anekayātanā-samsthāḥ ye nītā o', and treating 52-53 as one mantra and 54-55 as one mantra)15226. He should offer 19 pindas

It is difficult to understand why the writers of digests did not say that the srāddhasodasi should be performed with only 18 mantras from out of the 2 or 22 verses with option to the reciter.

of the size already stated and made of the material already mentioned with the sacred thread in the apasavya form. Raghu nandana explains that although there are nineteen pindas still this is called śrāddhasodasi as a technical term.1523 It would be noticed that all the mantras refer to males in the words 'ye', 'te', ‘tebhyah'. So this is 'Pum-sodasī.' There is a 'strī-sodasī' also which only involves changing the words of the mantras in the masculine to words in the feminine gender as indicated in the Vāyupurāṇa itself. 1524 Otherwise there is no difference between the two (pumsodaśī and strīgodaši). The note below states the mode in which both males and females are to be invoked and gratified. 

Water should be sprinkled over all pindas three times with a vessel full of water mixed with sesame. The mantras repeated at the time are quoted below in the note 1525 Then he prostrates himself on the ground and should dismiss (send away) them (the persons invoked) with the words 'O father and others! forgive me.' Then wearing the sacred thread in the savya form, he should sip water (perform ācamana) and recite with his face to the east the two mantras (Vāyu 110.59-60 ‘sākṣiṇaḥ santu," and 'āgatosmi Gayām'). If a pilgrim is unable to carry out all this lengthy procedure, he should at least offer pindas on Pretasila, by making a sankalpa (like the one in note 1516 saying "pindadānam' for śrāddham'). He should wear the sacred thread in the apasavya mode and repeat the verses in Vāyu (110. 10-12 and 110.59-60) and should perform according to his sūtra the various items such as drawing lines on the altar meant for placing pindas, spreading kusas, sprinkling down water on the pindas, the offering of pindas, re-sprinkling

Then the pilgrim should descend from the hill (Pretaśilā) to the ground below and should bathe in the deep pool well known as Rāmatirtha 1526 (which is in the form of Prabhāsa hrada) at the meeting place of the great river (Phalgu) with the Prabhāsa hill after making a sankalpa (as given in the foot note ) and after repeating the mantra 'janmāntarasatam' (Vāyu 108.18). He should then perform tarpaņa and perform śrāddha or (if unable to offer śrāddha) offer only pindas accord ing to the procedure of his own grhyasūtra. He should offer as done in the Pretasila śrāddha twelve pindas to the father and the others, the single inexhaustible pinda and the sodasi pindas. If he cannot go through all these, he may perform any one of them. Then he should make a sankalpa and should offer obeisance to Rāma with the mantra 'Rāma Rāma'(Vāyu 108,20). When a pilgrim performs this bath, śrāddha and pindadāna his pitrs become free from the condition of being preta (Vāgu 108. 21). Then he should perform obeisance to the refulgent Prabhāseśa (Śiva). He should offer obeisance to both Rāma and Prabhāsesa with the mantra 'āpastvamasi' (Vāyu 108. 22). Then he should offer a bali of boiled rice to Yama with the words this is a bali, om! bow to Yama.' Then on a hill called Naga situated to the south of Prabhāsa hill and on the middle of Pretaśilā he should recite the verse 'dvau švānau' (Vāyu 108.30) and offer a bali made up of some kind of cooked food with the words 'this is a bali to Yamarāja and Bhramarāja (Dharma rāja?); salutation. This offering of bali is obligatory (on every pilgrim); the rest may be done according to one's ability. This finishes the rites on the first day (i.e. the day of entering Gayā). 

On the 2nd day of entering Gayā the pilgrim should bathe in Phalgu, perform his daily duty of tarpana and worship of gods and then in the afternoon bathe in Brahmakunda 1527 situated in the north-east corner which touches the root of Pretaparvata, that is at the distance of a gavyūti from Gavā and that (Brahmakunda) is situated to the north-west of Gavā.

The śrāddha performed here is believed to be performed on the altar of Brahmā (i. e. where Brahmā performed his Aśvamedha). Then he should with the face to the south throw on Pretapar vata barley grains mixed with sesame with the mantra 'ye kecit' (Vāyu 110.63 q. both by Tir. C. p. 297 and by Raghunandana) and offer an añjali of water mixed with sesame with the mantra fa-brahma' (Vāyu 110. 64).1528 

On the third day after entering Gayā come the rites of Pañcatirthi described above (pp. 663-666). The pilgrim bathes 1529 in the Uttaramānasa with the mantra 'uttare mānase snānam' (Vāyu 111. 2-3). He should offer one añjali with the verses (Vāyu 110. 20-21) and perform śrāddha. After this śrāddha he sits to the south of Uttara-mānasa, spreads kušas with tips towards the south, offers water with sesame and offers to all together one pinda of one handful of barley flour mixed with sesame, kušas, honey, curds and water. Then he bows to and worships the Sun's image on Uttaramānasa with the mantra 'namostu bhānave' (Vayu 111. 5). Then he repairs to Daksinamānasa in silence and there takes a bath in Udici tirtha, in Kanakhala and then in Dakṣiņamānasa with the mantra (Vāyu 111. 9-10) and then performs salutation and worship to Daksiņārka, then makes a bow to Maunārka, then goes to Phalgu tirtha situated to the east of Gadādhara and takes a bath and performs tarpana and śrāddha there; then he worships Pitāmaha (with Vayu 111. 19), visits Gadādhara and worships (with Vāyu 111.21), then again goes to the five tirthas, at each of which he bathes and performs tarpaņa. Then he bathes the image of Gadādhara with pañcāmrta. Raghu nandana notes that the bathing of Gadādhara with pañcāmsta is obligatory, while the rest may be done according to one's ability. This finishes the rites of pañcatirthi.

nandana will alone be specified here. After bath and srāddha at Matangavāpi, the pilgrim should go to Matangeśa to the north of Matangavāpi and recite Vāyu 111. 25 (pramānam devatāh santu &c.). When pouring water at the root of the mango tree established by Brahma the pilgrim repeats Vāyu 111. 36 (āmram brahma-sarodbhūtam &c.). When bowing to Brahmā, the mantra is Vāyu 111. 34 (namo brahmane &c.). The bali to Yama is offered with Vāyu 111. 38 (Yamarāja. dharmarājau &c.). The bali to the two dogs is to be given with the mantra (Vāyu 111. 39) and that to the crows with Vāyu 111. 40 (Aindra-vāruņa-vāyavya &c.). As regards the padas the pilgrim should begin with Rudrapada and perform śrāddha there and then proceed to Visnupada and worship Visnu with five upacaras1530 with the mantra 'Idam Visnur-vi cakrame'(Rg. I. 22.17). To the south of the vedi of Visnupada he should perform the śrāddhaṣodasi (described above pp. 672-673) up to Vāyu 110. 60 (anặposham-rpatrayāt). About an ascetic, vide above p. 655. 

Then Raghunandana briefly touches upon the śrāddhas to be performed at the several padas and remarks that the last śrāddha at the padas is that at Kaśyapapada. He prescribes Vāyu 111.76 as the mantra for bath in Gadalola-tirtha. Then he states that the śrāddha at the 'Akṣayavata is to be performed on the north side of the Vata near its bottom. He prescribes Vāyu 111. 82-83 (ekārņave &c. ) as the mantras for bowing to the Akṣayavața. Further, he speaks of śrāddhas to be performed at several sub-tīrthas, such as Gāyatri, Sarasvati, Viśālā, the hermitage of Bharata, Mundappstha. Then he prescribes that the pilgrim should cross the Vaitarani (situated to the east of the Devanadi which is near Bhasmakūta) with the mantra (Vāyu 105.44, yāsau Vaitarani nāma &c.). After referring to several other tirthas such as Gopracāra, Ghrtakulya, Madhu kulyā, Raghunandana recommends that the pilgrim should visit Pandusila (which is in Campakavana near Pitamaha) and perfo 

form śrāddha there. He notes that the four rivers and streams called Ghộtakulya, Madhukulyā, Devika and Mahānadi 1531 (Phalgu) are called Madhusravā when they meet the Sila (Vāvu

112.30) and a bath, tarpaņa and śrāddha thereon yield immense results. Then are mentioned several other tirthas such as Daśāśvamedha, Matangapada, Makha-kunda (near Udyanta parvata), Gayāküta. Raghunandana winds up by providing that on Bhasmakuta the pilgrim should place with his right hand in the hand of Janārdana a pinda mixed with curds (but without sesame ) and on doing so recite five verses (Vāyu 108. 86--90. 1532 'esa pindo maya' &c.). Then Raghunandana qu sixteen verses about Mātrsodasi (which do not occur in Vayu purāṇa and are passed over here). 

We have to distinguish between Gayākgetra, Gaya and Gayāśiras or Gayāśirsa. The Vāyu, Agni and Nāradiya all assert that Gayāksetra is five krośas 1533 (in extent) and Gaya śiras is one kroša. It had become the fashion to speak of famous tirthas like Kāśi and Prayāga as pañcakrosa. But so far as the Vāyupurāṇa is concerned the Gayāksetra is about 13 miles in length from Pretašila to Mahābodhi tree as shown above. Gayā is said to be two krosas and a half in extent in all directions from Mund aprstha 1534, Gayasiras is sinaller than Gayā and is identified with Phalgutirtha (vide note 1499 ). Gaya and Gayasīsa (Pāli for Gayāśirsa) are well known to ancient Buddhist texts (Mahāvagga I. 21.1 in S. B. E. XIII p. 136, Anguttaranikāya, text vol. IV. p. 302). Vide n. 1510. 

Four of the most important and holy tirthas have been dealt with at some length so far. It is not possible in the space allotted to the section on tirthas to pursue the same procedure as regards other famous tirthas. It is proposed to devote a few pages to each of half a dozen or more tirthas and then to give a somewhat comprehensive list of tirthas with a few references in the case of each. But before proceeding further reference must be made to certain popular groupings of tirthas. There is a group of seven cities that are deemed to be very holy and

KURUKSETRA AND SOME OTHER FAMOUS 

TIRTHAS 

KURUKSETRA (25 miles east of Ambala) is a very sacred tract, the history of which is lost in the mists of anti quity. In the Rgveda X, 33.4 there is a reference to a king Kurusravana, son of Trasadasyu,1538 The Atharva-veda men tions a Kauravya husband (probably a king) who had a talk with his wife.1539 In the times of the Brāhmaṇas Kuruksetra had become a very holy land. The Sat. Br. (IV.1.5.13) narrates the legend that the gods performed a sacrifice in Kuruksetra and at first excluded the two Asvins from any share in it (S. B. E. vol. 26 p.275). The Maitrāyani Samhitā (II. 1. 4., devā vai sattramāsata Kuruksetre) and the Tai. Br. (V.1.1., devā vai sattram-āsata teṣām Kuruksetram vedir-āsit) also say that the Gods performed a satira in Kuruksetra. The idea underlying these passages appears to be this. The Vedic people of the Brāhmana period held yajñas to be the dharma par excellence, as stated in Rg. X. 90.16 (yajñena yajñam-ayajanta devāstāni dharmāni prathamānyāsan). Kuruksetra was the centre of ✓ Vedic culture in the Brāhmana period and sacrifices must have been performed there on a large scale. Hence it was called dharmaksetra and as gods were supposed to have attained their position by what men believed to be dharma (yajña, tapas &c.) it is stated that gods performed sattras in Kuruksetra. The same Brāhmaṇa mentions a Kauravya king Bahlika Prātipiya (XII. 9.3.3, S. B, E. vol. 44 p. 269). The Tai. Br. (1. 8.4.1) informs us that the Kuru-Pañcālas went towards the east in winter (śiśıra) and to the west in summer which was the worst season. The references in the Ait. Br. are far more instructive. The legend about Kavaṣa in which Sarasvati helps the sage has already been referred to above (p. 559 n. 1254). The Ait Br 

(8.1 or II 19) calls that place, where Sarasvati came rushing. Parisaraka'. In another place the Ait. Br. tells us that in its time Nyagrodha (Ficus India) was called Nyubja in Kuru A

ksetra.1540 Elsewhere the Ait. Br. speaks of the countries of the Kurus and Pancalas together with the Vasa-Usinaras (38. 3=VIII. 14). The Tai. Ā, narrates 1541 that the gods performed a sattra and Kuruksetra was their altar (for the sattra). The southern side of that Vedi (i. e. Kuruksetra) was Khāndava, the northern side was Türghna, the hinder part was Parīpah, and the country of Maru (desert) was the rubbisn pit. This shows that Khāndava, Türghna and Parinah were border parts of Kuruksetra and the Maru district was somewhat away from Kuruksetra. The Srautasütras of Āśv. XII, 6, Lātyāyana X. 15 ft. and Katyāyana 1542 24.6.5 ff closely follow Tāndya and other Brāhmaṇas and mention several holy places at which parts of the Sārasvata sattras were performed such as Plaksa Prasravana where Sarasvati starts, the Vaitandhava-hrada of Sarasvati, the tract called Parinah in Kuruksetra, Yamunā flowing through the country of Kārapacava and the country of Triplaksāvaharana, 

In the Chăndogya Upaniṣad (I. 10.1 ff) occurs the story of Uṣasti Cākrāyaṇa who, when the Kuru country was struck by hailstorms, lived with his very young wife in Ibhyagrāma and went begging for food, 

The Nirukta (II. 10) explains that 1543 Devāpi and Santanu mentioned in Rgveda X. 98.5 and 7 were historical persons and were brothers, sons of Rstisena, a king of Kuru. Panini (IV.1. 151 and IV.1.172) explains the formation of the word Kauravya from 'Kuru', the first in the sense of apatya', the second in the sense of 'king. '1544

History of Dharmaśāstra 

[Vol. 

The Mahābhārata frequently speaks of the high sanctify ing virtues of Kuruksetra. It appears that the territory to the south of Sarasvati and to the north of Drsadvati was included in Kuruksetra and 1545 that those who resided therein were as if residents of paradise. Kuruksetra appears to be called Brahmāvarta in Vanaparva 86.6. According to the Vamanapurana Kurujāngala is 1546 the country between the Sarasvati and Drsadvatī, while Manu (II. 17, 18) defines Brahmāvarta as the country created by God between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drsadvati, states that Brahmarsi deśa which is slightly less (in holiness) than Brahmāvarta comprises Kuruksetra, the countries of Matsya, Pañcāla and Sūrasena. From these passages it is clear that Brahmāvarta is the holiest country in Aryāvarta and that Kuruksetra was almost like it; we have seen that in the times of the Brāh manas the most sacred Sarasvati flowed through Kuruksetra and that the place where Sarasvati disappeared in the desert was called Vinaśana and was itself a very holy place. J Origi nally the land called Kuruksetra is said to have been the Vedi (sacrificial altar ) 1547 of Brahmā, then it came to be called Samantapancaka (or syamanta-in some passages) when Parasu rāma made five pools of the blood of ksatriyas in revenge for his father's murder, which were subsequently turned into holy pools of water by the blessings of his pitrs and lastly it came to be called Kurukṣetra when king Kuru, son of Samvaraṇa1548, ploughed the land with a golden plough for seven krosas all round. Kuruksetra is so called after king Kuru. Kuru is said

to have asked of Indra the boon that the territory he ploughed might be 'Dharmakṣetra' (domain of righteousness) and that those who may bathe or die there may reap a rich harvest of merit 1549. The war between Kurus and Pandavas was fought there. It is spoken of as 'Dharmaksetra' in the opening verse of the Bhagavad-gītā. Kurujāngala is said to be a very fit country for sraddha in Vāyu (177.93) and Kūrma II, 20. 33 and 37. 36-37. In the 7th century the Chinese traveller Hiouen Thsang speaks of the country, the capital of which was Sthān visvara (modern Thanesar which is the heart of Kuruksetra) as the 'land of religious merit' (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I p. 184). 

The extent of Kuruksetra is said to be five yojanas in radius (in Vanaparva and the Vamana Purana) 1550. A some what corrupt verse occurs in the Mahābhārata and some puranas 1551 about the limits of Kuruksetra viz. the territory between Tarantu and Kārantuka and between Macakruka (image of a yakṣa) and the Rama-hradas (pools made by Para surāma)-this is Kuruksetra, Samantapañcaka and the nor thern vedi of Brahmā. The result is that Kuruksetra is referr. ed to under various names viz. Brahmasaras, Rāmahrada, Samantapancaka, Vinaśana, Sannihati (vide T. Pr, p. 463). For the boundaries of Kuruksetra, vide Cunningham's A, S. R. of India, vol. XIV pp. 86-106 where he notes that Kuruksetra was 30 miles to the south of Ambala and 40 miles to the north of Panipat. In the remote past Kuruksetra was the centre of

all the activities and the culture of the Vedic people. Gradually the Vedic people spread towards the east and south and the country between the Ganges and Jumnā and later on Videha (or Mithilā) became the centres of Indian culture. 

For reasons of space it is not possible to dwell at length on the greatness and sanctity of Kuruksetra as described in the Mahābhārata and the Purānas. Vanaparva 83 starts by say ing that all beings that are in Kuruksetra are freed from all sins and that he also who always says 'I shall go to Kuru kṣetra, and I shall reside in Kuruksetra' is freed from sins 1552. 'In this world there is no place holier than this. Even the particles of dust driven from Kuruksetra by the wind take a great sinner to the highest goal' 1553. Even the Ganges is com pared to Kuruksetra (vide note 1324 'Kuruksetrasamā Gangā'). The Náradiya avers 1554 that planets, constellations and stars are subject to the danger of falling down (from the sky) in course of time, but in the case of those that die in Kuruksetra there is no falling on the earth again (i. e. they would not be born again). 

It is a remarkable fact that though the Vanaparva in chap. 83 enumerates several tirthas on the Sarasvati and in Kuruksetra, they do not at all tally with the tirthas mentioned in the Brāhmaṇas and the Srautasütras (except Vinaśana which is mentioned in Vanaparva 83.11 and probably Saraka which may be identified with Parisaraka of the Ait. Br.). This means that the Vanaparva account of Sarasvati and Kuruksetra is later by some centuries than that in the Srautasūtras. The Nāradiya (uttara, chap. 65 ) names about one hundred tirthas in Kurukse tra. It is not possible to set out all of them, But a few words may be said about some of them. First comes the lake called Brahmagaras or Pavana-hrada (Vanaparva 83. 85, Vāmana 49. 38-41, Nāradiya, uttara 65. 95) on

which Kuru stayed as an ascetic. A. G. (pp. 334-335 ) remarks that the lake is 3546 feet long east to west and 1900 feet wide north to south. The Vāmanapurana (22. 50-55) describes it at some length and says that it was half a yojana in extent. Cakratirtha (mentioned by Vāmanapurāṇa 42,5, 57. 89 and 81. 3) is popularly supposed to be the place where Krsna took up the discus for attacking Bhisma. Vyāsas thali 1555 (named in Vanaparva 84. 96, Nāradiya, uttarārdha 65. 83 and Padma I. 26. 90-91) is the same as modern Basthali, 17 miles to the south-west of Thanesar where Vyāsa resolved to die on the loss of his son. Asthipura (Padma, Adi. 27. 62) is on the west of Thanesar and south of Aujasa ghāt where the bodies of the warriors killed in the Great Bhārata war were cremated. Cunningham in Archaeological Survey Reports of India vol. II. p. 219 states that Cakratirtha is the same as Asthipura and that in Alberuni's time it was the most famous shrine in Kuruksetra. Prthüdaka on ths Saras vati is very highly spoken of in Vanaparva 83. 142-149. "They say 1556 that Kuruksetra is holy, that Sarasvati is holier than Kuruksetra, that the sacred spots (on Sarasvati) are holier than the river Sarasvati and that Pșthüdaka is holier than all the other tīrthas on Sarasvati. There is no tīrtha that is better than Prthūdaka'. The Salyaparva1557 remarks that whoever, while intently engaged in repeating holy texts, abandong his life at Prthūdaka on the northern bank of the Sarasvati would not be troubled by death next day (i. e. he would be free from birth and death). The Vamanapurana (39. 20 and 23) calls it Brahma yonitirtha. Prthüdaka is modern Pehova in the Karnal Dist. rict in Panjab, 14 miles to the west of Thanesar. Vide E.I. vol. I. p. 184 for the Pehova inscription from the temple of Garibnath dated in samvat 276 (of the Harsa Era) i. e. 882-883 A.

The Vāmanapurāṇa (34.3 ff) and Nāradīya (uttarārdha 65. 4-7) enumerate seven forests existing in Kuruksetra as very holy and as destroyers of all sins, viz. Kāmyaka, Aditivana, Vyāsavana, Phalakivana, Süryavana, Madhuvana and Sitā vana. Vide A. S. R. for India, vol. 14 pp. 90-91 for the vanas. In the Salyaparva (chap. 38) it is said that the world is encom passed by seven Sarasvatis, then they are enumerated and their locations are specified viz. Suprabhā (in Puṣkara, where Brahmā engaged in a great sacrifice remembered her, verse 13), Kāñcanāksi (in the Naimisa forest, v. 19), Viśālā (invoked by Gaya in the Gaya country, verses 20-21), Manoramā (in Auddālaka's yajña in Uttarakosala, verses 22-25), Sureņu (in Rṣabhadvipa in Kuru's yajña, verses 26-27), Oghavati (called by Vasistha in Kuruksetra, verses 27–28), Vimalodā (when Brahmā again performed a yajña in the Himālaya). In the Vāmanapurāṇa 34, 6-8 seven rivers in connection with Saras. vati are said to be very holy (but nine are actually enumerated) viz, Sarasvati, Vaitarani, Āpagā, Gangā-Mandākini, Madhu sravā, Ambunadi, Kauśiki, Drṣadvati and Hiraņvati. 

Kuruksetra was also called Sannihati or Sannihatyā. Vide those words in the list of tirthas. The Vāmanapurāṇa (32.3-4) says that Sarasvati springs from a plaksa tree, that after pier cing many hills it enters Dvaitavana. Vāmana (32. 6-22) contains a eulogy of Sarasvati by Markandeya. Alberuni (Sachau, vol. I. p. 261) states that the river Sarasvati falls into the sea at the distance of a bowshot east of Somnath. There is a small but holy stream called Sarasvati, that rises in the Mahikantha hills and after crossing the south-east corner of Palanpur Agency passes by Siddhapura and Patan, flows under ground for some miles and then enters the Runn of Cutch (Bom, G. vol. V. p. 283).1557a

to rest on firm ground. It is stated in the Anguttaranikāya (I. 167, ekam samayam āyasmā Mahākaccano Madhurāyam viharati Gundāvane) and Majjhima (II. 84 same words) that Mahākaccāyana, a famous disciple of Buddha, assiduously preached in Mathurā the principles of his Master, Megas thenes appears to have known Mathurā and its connection with Heracles 1558 (Hari-Krṣņa ?). The word 'Māthura' (meaning a resident of Mathurā, or born in or coming from Mathurā) occurs in Jaimini's Pūrva-mīmānsā-sūtra 1559 Though Panini's sūtras do not expressly mention Mathura, the latter is included in the Varaņādi-gana (Pān. IV. 2. 82). Pāņini is, however, aware of Vāsudeva and Arjuna (IV. 3. 98), the Andhaka and Vrsni clans of Yadavas to which Krsna belonged (IV.1. 114) and probably knew the name Govinda (III. 1. 138 and vārtika 'gavi ca vindeh sanjñāyām"). Mathurā is several times mention ed by the Mahābhāsya of Patañjali who 1560 in a famous passage refers to dramatic representations, paintings and stories which depict the destruction of Kamsa by Vāsudeva. He also cites a quarter of a verse about the killing of Kamsa by Vāsudeva as a well-known past event. Whether the town Saurya mentioned in the Mahābhāṣya on Vārtika 2 on Pāṇini II. 4.7 (sauryam ca Ketavatā ca Saurya-Ketavate) is the same as Mathurā is doubtful, even though the Uttarādhyayanasutra speaks of Mathurā as Sauryapura (S. B. E. vol. 45 p. 112). The Adiparva (221. 46) indicates that Mathurā was famed for excellent cows 

1558. Vide McCrindle's 'Megasthenes and Arrian' p. 201 where it is said that Heracles was held in special honour by the Saurasenoi tribe (Sürasena) which possessed two large cities, Mathura and Kleisobora (Krsnapura?); while Ptolemy calls it "Modoura of the gods' (vide Mc Crindle's 'Ancient India as described by Ptolemy'. ed. of 1927, p. 124).

in those days. When Hamsa and Dimbhaka, brave command ers of Jarāsandha, drowned themselves in the Jumnā and when Jarāsandha sorrowfully went to Magadha Krsna says 'we shall again joyfully reside in Mathura' (Sabhāparva 14. 41-45). Ultimately Krsna is said to have left Mathurā owing to the constant attacks of Jarāsandha and established the Yādavas in Dvārakā 1561 (Sabhāparva, 14. 49-50 and 67). The Brahma purāṇa, on the other hand, states that the Vrspis and Andha kas on the advice of Krsna left Mathurā through the fear of Kālayavana. Vide also Vi. V. 23. 8-15. The Vāyu (88. 185) states that Satrughna, the brother of Rāma, killed the demon Lavaņa, son of Madhu and established Mathurā in Madhuvana while the Rāmāyana (Uttara-kāņda 70. 6-9) informs us that Satrughna took twelve years to make Mathurā a fine and pros perous city.

IV. pp. 79-89 No. 454) Mathurā is called Uttara Madhurā (to distinguish it from Madhurā of the Pandyas in the south) and the story of Kamsa and Vasudeva is narrated, which differs in some material points from the Mahābhārata and the Purānas. In the Raghuvamsa XV.28 it is mentioned as Madhurā and as founded by Satrughna. Hiouen Thsang states that in Mathurā there existed in his day three stūpas built by Aśokarāja, that there were in Mathurā five Deva temples, 20 sanghārāmas (Buddhist convents ) with 2000 Buddhist priests (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. I. p. 179). James Allan (in 'Catalogue of the coins of Ancient India' 1936, p. CXVI) states that the coins of the Hindu kings of Mathurā cover the period from the begin ning of the 2nd century B. C. to the middle of the first century B. C. For some ancient coins from Mathurā, the Cambridge History of India, vol. I. p. 538 and plate V (No. 5-10) may be referred to. An interesting and informative work is 'Mathurā' by F.S. Growse (2nd ed. 1880). Inscriptions contribute important evidence about the history and antiquity of Mathurā. 1562 The famous inscription of Khāravela (E, I. vol. XX, at p. 179) includes among the exploits of that king of Kalinga the retreat of the Yavana king Dimita to Madhurā (i. e. Mathurā). Several

Inscriptions on Mathurā 

689 

Inscriptions of such Kuṣāņa rulers as Kaniska, Huviska and others relating to Mathurā have been published of which the following may be mentioned: Inscription on a Nāga image at Mathurā of 'Mahārāja-rājātirāja Kanikkha' in samvat 8 (E. I. vol. 17. p. 10) 1563; the Mathurā pedestal Inscription of Kaniska in the 14th year (E.I. vol. 19 p. 96); inscription on the pedestal of the image of a seated Bodhisattva at Mathurā in the reign of Huviska in saivat 33 (E. I. vol. 8 pp. 181-182); Inscription of a king Vāsu (rest of the name lost) of the year 74 (E. I. vol. 9 p. 241) and of the time of Sondāsa (E. I. vol. 9 p. 246); seven Brāhmi inscriptions from Mathurā and its vicinity (E. I. vol. 24 pp. 194-210). There is further an interesting inscription recording the dedication of a stone slab in the temple of Nāgendra Dadhikarņa by Nandibala and other sons of some actor (Sailālaka) brothers of Mathurā (E. I. vol. I. , at p. 390). From the Visnu-purāņa VI. 8. 31 it follows that an image of Hari had been installed in Mathurā before that purāṇa was composed. The Vāyupurāņa 1564 informs us in a prophetic vein that seven Nāga kings will rule over Mathurā, Prayāga, Sāketa and Magadha before the Guptas. Alberuni's India (vol. II, p. 147) states that Māhurā (Mathurā) is crowded with brāhmaṇas. 

From the above brief historical sketch it would appear that Mathurā was, five or six centuries before Christ, a flourish ing city where the epic Hinduism prevailed, that later on Buddhism and Jainism dominated it, that there must have been a revival of Hinduism under the Nāga and Gupta emperors, that in the 7th century A. D., when Hiouen Thsang wrote, Hinduism and Buddhism were equally prominent and that in the 11th century A. D. it was completely dominated by the Brahmanio faith. 

The Agnipurāņa furnishes the strange information that Bharata at the command of Rāma killed three crores of the sons of Sailūsa in the city of Mathurā 1565. Mathurā has been

the centre of Kșsna worship and of Bhāgavatism for over two thousand years. The Varāha-purāņa devotes about one thou sand verses to the greatness of Mathurā and its sub-tirthas (chap. 152-178). The BỊhan-nāradiya, chapters 79-80, Bhāga vata X and Viṣņu-purāņa V-VI devote much space to Krsna, Rādhā, Mathurā, Vịndāvana, Govardhana and Krsna's ex ploits there. 

For want of space only a few verses about Mathura will be set out here. The Padma (Ādikhanda 29. 46-47) says 'Yamunā gives moksa when united with Mathurā; Yamunā gives rise to great merit in Mathurā and when united to Mathurā it bestows devotion to Visnu'. In the Varāhapurana (152. 8, 11) Visņu says "There is no place either in the nether regions or on the earth or in mid air as dear to me as Mathurā. Mathurā is a famous ksetra of mine that confers mukti; no place is to me higher than it. It is my birth-place and it is lovely, com mendable and dear to me'. The Padma says "Māthuraka is a name extremely dear to Visņu'. The Harivamsa contains a fine description of Mathurā, one verse from which may be quoted here 'Mathurā is the hump (i. e. the most eminent spot) of Madhyadeśa, it is simply the abode of the goddess of wealth, it is the horn (i. e. the most prominent part) of the earth, there is nothing like it and it is endowed with abundant wealth and agricultural produce ? 1566 

The tract round about Mathurā is said to be 20 yojanas in extent and the city of Mathurā was in its midst 1567. The Varāhapurāṇa and the Nāradiya (uttarārdha) chapters 79-80 mention numerous tirthas in and about Mathurā. It is not possible to enumerate them here. A few important ones will be noticed briefly. Both Varāha (chap. 153 and 161 6-10) and Nāradiya (uttarardha 79. 10-18) mention twelve forests near Mathurā viz. Madhu, Tāla, Kumuda, Kāmya, Bahula, Bhadra,

Vanas and other holy places

Khādira, Mahāvana, Lohajangha, Bilva, Bhāndira and Vrndāvana. There are also 24 upavanas enumerated by Growse on 'Mathurā' (p. 76) which are not mentioned by the Purānas but only by later works. Vịndāvana 1568 was to the north-west of Mathurā on the Yamunā and was five yojanas in extent (Visnupurāņa V. 6. 28-40, Nāradiya, uttarārdha 80. 6,8 and 77). It was the scene of Krsna's adventures and love-making. The Padma IV. 69.9 speaks of it as a portion of Vaikuntha on the earth. The Matsya (13.38) identifies Rādha in Vrndāvana as Devi Dāksāyanj.1569. In Kālidāsa's day it had great fame. In Raghuvamsa VI, while describing Suṣena of the Nīpa family, king of Śūrasena, Vrndāvana is said to be no less charming than Caitraratha, the park of Kubera (verse 50). Then there is the Govardhana 1570 hill, which Krsna lifted up on his little finger to afford shelter for seven days to the cowherds and their cattle against the heavy rains sent down by Indra (Visnupurāṇa V. 11. 15–25). It is stated in the Varāhapurāṇa (164. 1) that Govardhana is about two yojanas from Mathurā to its west. This appears to be tolerably correct as at present it is 18 miles from Vrndāvana. The Kūrma (I. 14. 18) says that the very ancient king Pệthu performed austerities here. The details given in the Hari-vamsa and the Purāņas are sometimes confused and misleading. For example, in the Harivamsa (Vispuparva 13.3) it is stated that Talavana is to the north of Govardhana on the Yamunā, while it is south-east of Govar dhana. Kālidāsa refers to the caverns of Govardhana (Raghu vaṁsa 6.51). Gokula is the same as Vraja or Mahāvana, where

1569. Dey (p. 42) regards the identity of the modern Vrndāvana which is only 6 miles from Mathura (in the opposite direction to Gokula) with the ancient Vrndāvana described in the Puranas as extremely doubtful on several grounds, the most cogent being that ancient Vrndāvana and Mathurā appear to have been situated on opposite sides of the Yamunā, while modern Vrndavana and Mathura are on the same side of the river. But the references he gives for this last statement viz. Visnupurāṇa 5. 18. and Bhagavatapurāṇa X. 39.34 do not in my opinion bear out what he says. The Nāradiya (II. 80. 6-7) appears to say that Vpodāvanaisonen Govardhana and along the Yamunā and Nandigrāma.

Krsna was brought up in his early childhood by Nand-gopa who removed his habitation from Gokula to Vrndāvana out of fear of what Kamsa might do. The great Vaisnavite saint Caitanya visited Vrndāvana (Caitanya-caritāmrta canto 19 and 9th Act of the drama Caitanyacandrodaya, both by Kavikarņa pūra or Paramānandadāsa). In the 16th century Vịndāvana became a centre of Caitanya's bhakti movement owing to the strenuous efforts and learned writings of the Gosvamins of Vịndāvana, particularly Sanātana, Rūpa and Jiva. Vide Prof. S. K. De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' (1942) pp. 83-122, Vallabhācārya, who was a contemporary of Caitanya founded new Gokula, one mile to the south of Mahāvana in imitation of the ancient Gokula. Caitanya and Vallabhācārya met at Vịndāvana (vide Manilal C. Parekh's work on Vallabhācārya p. 161). The old temples of Mathurā met the same fate at the orders of Aurangzeb as the temples of Banaras 1571 

The Sabhāparva (319. 23–25) narrates that Jarasandha threw his mace from Girivraja (Rājgir in Bihar, the ancient capital of Magadha) and it fell in Mathurā at the distance of 99 yojanas before Krsna and the place where it fell was thence called Gadāvasāna. I have not come across this name anywhere else. 

Growse describes in chap. IX pp. 222 ff. the temples of Vrndāvana and in chap. XI Govardhana, Barsān, the birth place of Rādhā, and Nandgaon. Vide also 'Picturesque India' by W. S. Caine pp. 253 ff. for Mathurā and neighbouring holy places.

There are four most important tirthas in Orissa, viz. Bhuvaneśvara (or Cakratirtha), Jagannātha (or Sankha-ksetra), Kopārka (or Padma-kṣetra), Yajpura or Jajpur (Gadāksetra). The first two are still held in high esteem, while the last two are altogether neglected. 

Among the Puranas, Purushottama-tirtha is extensively dealt with in the Brahma (chap. 41-70, about 1600 verses), in the Brhannāradiya (uttarārdha chap. 52-61, 825 verses ). Among digests, the Tirtha-cintāmaņi of Vācaspati that devotes nearly one-third of the work to Purusottama-tīrtha (pp. 53 175) and that quotes about 800 verses from the Brahmapurāṇa on Purusottama, Raghunandana's Purusottama-tattva (which is brief and mostly based on the Brahmapurāņa) and the Tirthaprakāśa (pp. 561-594) may be mentioned. It is worthy of note that the Kalpataru (composed about 1110-1120 A, D.) does not describe Puruṣottama-tirtha in its Tirthakānda, though it speaks of a few little known tirthas like Lohārgala, Stutasvāmin and Kokāmukha, 

Raghunandana in his Puruṣottama-tattva quotes a verse1572 ( which as printed is corrupt ) from the Rgveda that from the context appears to be addressed to some evil spirit (alaksmi) and means 'O evil spirit with a wicked looking chin (or that art difficult to be killed)! Have recourse to that far-off wood in the sea, that has no connection with human beings and go. to distant lands with it'. Then he states that the Atharva veda has a similar verse. Probably following Sāyana's inter

Argo mentions a predecessoire inter pretation of this verse viz. that it is addressed to an evil spirit falakamah and asks it to resort to a boat or a log of wood (as a scapegoat) and to go to a fat

pretation, Raghunandana connects this Rgveda verse with Purusottama, the image of which is made of wood. 

It would be proper to set out as briefly as possible the story of Jagannātha contained in the Brahmapurāņa. In Bharatavarṣa there is a country called Ondra situated on the shores of the southern ocean, which extends northwards from the sea up to Viraja-mandala 1573 (chap. 28. 1-2). In that country there is a holy place, destroyer of sins and bestower of mukti, surrounded on all sides by sand and ten yojanas in extent (chap. 42. 13-14). There is the famous shrine of Puruso ttama in the country of Utkala the whole of which is very holy owing to the favour of the all-pervading Jagannatha (chap. 42. 35-37). Men who reside in Utkala are blessed like gods since Purusottama resides there. Chapters 43 and 44 narrate the story of Indradyumna who ruled at Avanti (Ujjayini) in Mālava (modern Mālvā). He was a very pious, learned and good king who after reading all Vedas, sāstras, epics, purāṇas and Dharmaśāstras came to the conclusion that Vāsudeva was the highest Deity, started from his capital Ujjayinī with a vast army, servants, priests and artisans and came to the shores of the southern sea, saw the kṣetra of Vasudeva, ten yojanas in breadth and five yojanas in length and encamped there. Formerly there was a Vața tree on the shores of the southern sea near which there was an image of Puruṣottama or 1574 Jagan nātha made of sapphire, which became embedded in sand and was concealed by creepers and plants. King Indradyumna per formed Aśvamedha there, erected a great temple (prāsāda) and was anxious to establish a suitable image of Vasudeva in the temple. In a dream the king saw Vāsudeva who told him to go alone to the shore in the morning and cut the Vața tree grow ing just on the water line with an axe. The king did so in the morning and then two brāhmanas (who were really Visnu and Višvakarma) appeared, Visnu told the king that his associate (Viśvakarmā) will manufacture the image. Three images of Krsna, Balarāma and Subhadrā were made and given to the king and Visnu further conferred the boon that the pool called

Story of Indradyumna 

695 

Indradyumna (where the king bathed at the end of his Aśva medha) will be known by the king's name, that whoever took a bath once in it would go to Indraloka, and that whoever offered piņdas on the bank of the pool would save 21 ancestors of his family. Then the king established the three images in the temple built by him. 1575 The Skandapurāņa contains a Puruṣottamamāhātmya in a sub-section called Utkala-khanda in its section Vaisnava-khanda, where the story of Indra dyumna is given with some variations. 

Stripping this story of the supernatural, it appears probable that the holy place Purusottama was called Nilācala in very ancient times, that Krsna worship was introduced from Northern India at that place, and that three images of wood were established in comparatively early times. It may be stated here that in the Maitrāyaṇi Upaniṣad 1576 an Indradyumna is named among a host of cakravartins. The Kūrmapurāņa (II. 35.27) makes a brief and colourless reference to Purusottama (tīrtham Nārāyaṇasyānyat-nāmnā tu Puruṣottamam). Rajendralal Mitra (Antiquities of Orissa') surmises that there were three periods in the history of the Purusottama-kṣetra, viz. early Hindu period, the Buddhist period and the Vaispava period (after the 5th century AD. when Buddhism began to wane). He notices that from about the 7th century A. D. consi derable temple records on palm leaves exist, but that the temple records for the Buddhist period are untrustworthy (p. 104) and that there are indications that Puri was probably a place of Buddhist sanctuary (p. 107). The indications of the existence 

1575. Vide Hunter's Orissa vol. I. pp. 89-94 for a somewhat differ ent account based on Kapilasamhita, the most important points of which are that Visnu shows to Indradyumna as His image a log of wood thrown up by the ocean, that the images were being fashioned by the divine carpenter, that it was ordered that no one was to see them till they were ready and that in spite of this, the queen insisted on seeing them when they had been chiselled only up to the waist and when only stems stood in the place of the arms for the images of Krsna and Balarama, while the image of Subhadra had no arms at all. The present images are to this day in the same condi tion. The images are described by Rajendralal Mitra in 'Antiquities of Orissa' II. pp. 122-123.

of Buddhism in Orissa are the existence of Asoka's rock edicts on the Dhauli Hill (C. I. I. vol. I. pp. 84-100), the existence of many caves of the Buddhist period on the Khaņdagiri range about five miles to the west of Bhuvaneśvara, the procession of the car of Jagannātha which resembles the procession of Buddha's Tooth relic as described by Fa Hien (Hunter's Orissa, vol. I. p. 131-132) and the three crude wooden images of Krsna, Subhadrā and Balarāma which are hardly found anywhere else and which correspond to the three peculiarities of Buddhism viz. Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. Vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa,' vol. II, pp. 122-126 (where he gives wood-cuts showing the figures of the images and comparing them with Buddhist symbols and Cunningham's 'Ancient Goegraphy of India' pp. 510-511 (the remarks in which appear to me far-fetched). In J.R. A. S. vol. 18 at p. 402 (new series) Sewell thinks that the celebrated image of Jagannātha was originally one of the Triśūlas or developed Taurus symbols. 

At present the sacred enclosure of Jagannātha is a square surrounded by a massive stone wall 20 feet high, 652 feet long and 630 feet broad with 120 temples containing various forms of God, 13 being temples of Siva, some more of Pārvati and a temple of the Sun. This clearly shows the catholi city of Jagannatha. Almost every form of Hindu faith is represented here. Even the Brahmapurāņa gives expression to this tolerant view when it says that the holy Purusottama kṣetra forbids all the wranglings between Saivas and the devotees of Visņu.1576a The great Pagoda of Jagannātha has four chambers, the first being the Hall of Offerings (bhogar mandira ), the 2nd the pillared hall for music and dance (the nața mandira), the third the audience hall where pilgrims assemble (the Jaganmohana mandira) and the 4th the inner sanctuary.

Temple of Jagannātha 

697 

temple is situated at the distance of about seven furlongs from the sea shore and stands on a mound about 20 feet above the level of the surrounding ground, the mound being dignified by being called Nilagiri (the blue hill). There is a large gate-way on each side of the enclosure, that on the east being the most magnificent. On each side of the entrance there is a colossal crouching lion and hence the door-way is called simha-dvāra (lion gate ). 

There are certain peculiar features of the great shrine of Jagannātha. In the first place, in the court of Jagannātha and outside the Lion Gate no distinction of caste 1578 is observed. Jagannātha is the god of all people. The second special feature is that the holy rice cooked as offering to Jagannātha is regard ed as so sanctified that all barriers of caste are transcended, so much so that a Parī priest will receive the holy food even from a low caste Hindu. The feeling is that cooked rice when once placed before Jagannātha never ceases to be pure. Hence the Mahāprasāda is dried, is taken to all parts of India and at the periodical srāddhas among Vaisnavas a grain of this holy rice is invariably put on the cake as the most sacred article that can be offered to the Manes (vide Mitra's 'Antiquities of Orissa'. vol. II p. 199). The third special feature of Jagannātha is the car festival (rathayātrā) which is the most important of the 24 high 1578a festivals at Puri. The festival is described at length by Hunter in his 'Orissa', vol. I. pp. 131-134. The car festival starts on the 2nd day of the bright half of Āsādha. The car of Jagannātha is about 45 feet in height, 35 feet square and is supported on 16 wheels of 7 feet diameter with 16 spokes and has Garuda as a crest; the 2nd car is that of Subhadrā, which is a little smaller than Jagannātha's car, resting on 12 wheels with 12 spokes in each and having a padma (lotus) as a crest; the 3rd car is that of Balarāma resting on 14 wheels with 14 spokes in each wheel and has Hanümān for crest. The cars are drawn by pilgrims and hired labourers from the temple to

the country-house of Jagannātha (which is about two miles away) amidst the shouts and emotional songs of thousands of pilgrims. Owing to the references in English literature to the car of Jagannātha it is supposed by many that pilgrims used to throw themselves before the car in a religious frenzy and were killed. But there is hardly any truth in these suppositions. There might have been a few accidental deaths. Hunter in ‘Orissa' (vol. I. pp. 133-34) scouts this idea of suicide under the car and Rajendralal observes (in 'Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. p. 99) 'No Indian divinity has a more unenviable notoriety in English Literature than Jagannātha. It is certain, neverthe less, that human conception has never realized a more innocent and gentle divinity than Jagannātha and the tenets of his votaries are the very reverse of sanguinary or revolting. Never was opprobrium more unjustly cast on an inoffensive object than in this instance and none merited it less'. On the 10th day of the bright half begins the return of the car from the country house. 

of According to Rajendralal Mitra the oldest temple in Puri is that of Alābukeśvara built by Lalātendu Kesari (623-677 A. D.), the builder of the tower of Bhuvanesvara; the next oldest is Mārkandeśvara and next comes the great temple of Jagannātha (vol. II. p. 112). Manmohan Chakravarti in his paper on the date of Jagannātha temple in Puri' (J. A. S. B., vol. 67 for 1898, part 1 pp. 328-331) quotes two verses from the Gangavamsa copper plates of Orissa which state that Gange śvara alias Codaganga built the great temple of Purusottama1579. As Codaganga's coronation took place in sake 999 (i. e. 1078 A. D.) according to M. M. Chakravarti, he put forward the view that the prāsāda of Jagannātha was built about 1085-1090 A. D. Dr. D. C. Sirkar (in 'God Purusottama at Puri' J. O. R., Madras vol. 17 pp. 209-215) points out that the celebrated Oriya Chronicle Madalā-pāñji attributes the construction of Purusottama Jagannātha not to Codaganga but to his great grandson Ananga-bhima III, who also installed an image of Purusottama in a temple at Vārāṇasi-Kataka (modern Cuttack)

These Ganga kings built magnificent temples at Bhuvaneśvara (ancient Ekāmra), Konārka and Puri, which are the finest surviving speci mens of North Indian Hindu Architecture. Mitra (‘Antiquities

In chap. 56. 72-73 Visnu asks Mārkandeya to build a temple of Siva to the north of Jagannātha and to construct a sacred pool which thence forward was to become known as “Mārkandeya's pool'. The Brahmapurāṇa provides that the pilgrim should bathe in Markandeya's pool, dip his head thrice, utter a mantra (chap. 57. 3-4), then he should perform tarpana, go to the temple of Siva (called Mārkandeyeśvara ) and worship him with the Mūlamantra 1582 viz. "Om namah Sivāya', then with another mantra called Aghora and a Paurānic mantra. The pilgrim should, after a bath in Mārkandeya's pool and visit to the temple of Siva, repair to the sacred Vața, circum-ambulate it

The Vata is also styled Kalpavrkṣa (Brahma 57. 12, 60.18). The pilgrim should bow to Garuda standing in front of Krspa and then worship Krsna, Sankarsapa and Subhadrā with mantras. The mantras for Sankarṣana are verses 22-23 of Brahmapurāṇa chap. 57 and that for Subhadrā is chap. 57. 58. 1584 The mantra to be used in the worship of Krsna is either of 12 syllables (om namo bhagavate Vasudevāya) or of eight syllables (om namo Nārāyaṇāya ). Brahmapurāṇa chap. 57 verses 42-51 specify the various rewards of seeing Krsna with devotion and wind up by promising moksa, 1585 A bath in the sea at Puri is always commendable, but particularly on the Full Moon day (Brahma 60.10). Brahma chap. 62 deals at length with the bath in the sea (the whole of it except one verse being quoted by Tir. C. pp. 126-128). The Indra dyumna pool has been mentioned above (pp. 694-95). The pilgrim has to bathe in the Indradyumna pool, perform tarpana for gods, sages and pitrs and offer pindas to his ancestors (chap. 63. 2-5). 

In the Govindapur stone Inscription of the poet Gangādhara (E. I. vol. II. p. 330 ) of śake 1059 i. e. (1137-38 A. D.) there is a clear reference to Purusottama, 1586 

The Brahmapurāņa chap. 66 speaks of the Gundicāyātrā for seven days on the bank of the Indradyumna pool in a mandapa where reside (temporarily ) Krsna, Sankarsana and Subhadrā. The Tir. C. which quotes the whole of that chapter (pp. 157-159), calls it Gundikā, while in the drama Caitanya

Gundicā-yātrā

candrodaya 1587 it is styled Gundica at the very beginning. It appears that Gundicā is the summer house of Jagannātha about two miles from the great Temple. The word is probably derived from gundi, which means a thick log of wood in Bengali and Uriya (vide Mitra's Antiquities of Orissa', vol. II. pp. 138-139 ) and has reference to the legend of a log of wood that Indradyumna found floating in the sea. 

It may be noted that religious suicide at Purusottama is referred to in Brahmapurana: 1588 'those who give up their body (life) in Purusottama-kṣetra after mounting up the Vața tree or do so between the Vata and the ocean reach without doubt mokṣa. A man abandoning life, either intentionally or unintentionally, either on his way to Purusottama or in the cemetery or in the country house (of Jagannātha ) or in the streets (of Jagannātha ) or even anywhere else there secures moksa. Therefore men desiring moksa should by all means give up life at that holy place'. 

The Brahmapurāṇa winds up by saying it is thrice 1589 true that that kṣetra (Puruṣottama) is the greatest and highest

The metre requires that the first two syllables in the name of the Yatrā should be us and ar and at may have been easily confused by the copyists of mss. The नारदीय (उ.) chap. 61.40 ff quotes the whole of ब्रह्म chap. 66 but reads गुण्डिचा.

Some writers such as Nilambaradasa in his 'Deul-tola' state that Gundicā was the name of Indradyumna's queen (Mahtab's 'History of Orissa' p. 161). I owe this last reference to the kind. ness of Dr. Raghavan of Madras University.

The great Vaisnava saint, Caitanya, settled permanently at Puri in 1515 A. D. at the age of thirty and spent eighteen years there till 1533 (when he died). He appears to have made a great impression on the Gajapati king Pratāparudra deva, ruler of Orissa (1497-1540 A, D.). In the drama Caitanya candrodaya of Kavikarnapūra the king is shown to be so anxious for meeting the saint that he declares that he would die if the gracious glance of the saint did not fall on him.1990 This should be attributed to the inveterate habit of gross exaggera tion rampant in most Sanskrit writers, particularly amongst devotees and followers of great saints. Caitanya came to be worshipped along with Visnu as a deity in Puri and Orissa (vide Hunter's 'Orissa' vol. I. p. 109). Kavikarnapüra in his drama (8th Act) makes Sārvabhauma say that there is no distinction between God Jagannātha and Caitanya, the only difference being that Jagannātha is dārubrahma' (Godhead manifested in a wooden image) and Caitanya is 'narabrahma' (Godhead in human form ).1591 The Caitanyacaritāmpta (a poem ) of Kavikarnapūra in cantos 14-18 deals with the devotional and ecstatic life of Caitanya at Puri and presents a vivid picture of Ratha and other festivals of Jagannātha in which Caitanya took a prominent part. I agree with Dr. S. K. De that there is no satisfactory evidence to show that Pratāparudra was actually converted into the new faith (Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal' p. 67). 

One regrettable feature of the great temple of Jagannātha is the existence of some obscene and lascivious sculptures that disfigure the walls of the temple and the presence of dancing girls with rolling eyes, to which pointed reference is made by all writers, particularly European ones ( vide, for example, Indian Antiquary vol. I. p. 322, Hunter's Orissa', vol. I pp. 111, 135). The presence of dancing girls is a legacy from the past.

NARMADA Next to the Ganges the most sacred rivers of India are the Narmadā and the Godāvarī. A few words about each of these may be said here. 

An express reference to the Narmadā has not so far been traced in the Vedic Literature. The Satapatha Br. (XII. 9.3.1) refers to one Revottaras who was a Pātava Cakra and sthapati (a chief) and whom the Srñjayas expelled (SBE. vol. 44 p. 269) 1593 Revā is another name for Narmadā 1594 and it is possible to say that Reyottaras was named after Revā. A vārtika on Pāṇ. IV. 2. 87 derives the word Mahismat (as the name of a country) from 'Mahisa'. This is generally identified with Māhismati (on the Narmada). So the name Narmadā was probably known to the author of the Vārtikas (about the middle of the 4th century B. C.). The Raghuvamsa VI. 43 speaks of Māhismati as the capital of Anūpa on the bank of the Revā (i. e. Narmadā). 

The Narmadā is frequently mentioned in the Mahābhārata and some of the Purāņas. The Matsya (chapters 186-194, 554 verses), Kūrma (Uttarārdha, chapters 40-42 verses 189), Padma Adikhanda (chap. 13-23,739 verses, most of which are the same as in the Matsya) deal with greatness of Narmadā and the tirthas thereon 1594. The Matsya (194.45) and Padma (Adi khapda 21. 44) state that from the place where the Narmadā falls into the sea up to the Amara-kantaka mountain (where it rises) there are ten crores of sacred places, while the Agni purāņa (113. 2) and Kūrma II. 40. 13 raise the number to 60 crores and 60 thousand.

says (verse 1) that there are 400 principal tirthas on both banks of the Narmadā, but from Amara-kantaka three crores and a half (verses 4 and 27-28). 1595 The Vanaparva (in chap. 188. 103 and chap. 222.24) mentions the Narmadā along with the Godā vari and other rivers of the south. In the same parva (chap. 89. 1-3) it is stated that the holy Narmadā is in the Ānarta country 1596, that it is endowed with priyangu creepers and mango groves, that it has strings of Vānīra fruit, that it flows to the west and that all the holy places in the three worlds come for a bath to the Narmadā. The Matsya and Padma declare 1597 that the Ganges is holy in Kanakhala, the Saras vati in Kuruksetra, but the Narmada is holy everywhere whether in a village or in a forest and that the Narmadā purifies the sinner by its very sight while the waters of the Sarasvati do so by three baths (on three days), of the Yamunā (by baths) in seven days and of the Ganges by a single bath. The Visnu dharmasūtra (85.8) in enumerating a list of tīrthas that are eminently fit for śrāddha includes the banks of the Narmadā throughout the whole length among them. The Narmadā is said 1598 to have started from the body of Rudra which is a poe tic way of saying that it rises from Amarakantaka that is said to be the abode of God Maheśvara and his spouse (Matsya 188.91). The Vāyupurāņa declares that the holy Narmadā, the best of rivers, is the daughter of the pitrs and the srāddhas offered on it become inexhaustible 1599. The Matsya and Kūrma both say 

1595. Though far and her are generally used as synonyms it is found that the traagrius in V. 19. 18 enumerates them separately (aritat

1596. Anarta appears to be the ancient name of Gujarat and Kathiawar together. In the Udyogaparva Dvāraka is called Anarta-nagari :(7.6). As Narmada is said to flow through Anarta it must be supposed that in the times of the Great Epic Anarta included both southern Gujarat and Kathiawar.

that the river Narmadā has a course of complete 100 yojanas and its breadth is two yojanas 1660. Prof. K. V. Rangaswami Aiyangar seizes upon the length of 100 yojanas and says (on p. 199 note 4 of his edition of Kalpataru on Tirtha in G.O.S.) that the Matsya is very accurate, since the length of the Narmada is now found to be about 800 miles. But he forgets that the breadth is said to be two yojanas (i. e. 16 miles on the scale for a yojana adopted by him). It is not shown how and where (except at the mouth if at all) the Narmada is 16 miles in breadth in its long course. Both Matsya and Kūrma state that the Narmadā is (rises) from Amarakantaka which is to the western side of the country of Kalinga 1601 

The Viṣnupurāņa provides that if a man repeats day and night and whenever he has to go inside a dark place the mantra 'Salutation to Narmadā in the morning! salutation to Narmadā at night! 0 Narmadā! salutation to you; save me from poisonous serpents' 1602 he has no danger from serpents, 

It is stated in the Kūrma and the Matsya that a man who commits suicide by entering fire or water or by fasting (on some of the tirthas on the Narmadā or on Amarakanțaka) does not return (to this samsāra).1603 

The Narmada is mentioned as Namados by Ptolemy (p. 102). One of the earliest inscriptional references to it occurs in the Eran stone pillar Inscription of Budhagupta in 165 of Gupta era i. e. 484-85 A. D. Vide C. I. I. vol. III, at p. 89. 

Several rivers are mentioned as falling into the Narmada such as Kapilā (on the south bank, Matsya 186. 40, Padma I. 13. 35), Visalya (Matsya 186.46 = Padma II. 13. 35-39), Erandi (Matsya 191.42-43, Padma I. 18. 44), Iksu-nādi (Matsya 191. 49, Padma I. 18. 47), Kaveri (Matsya 189. 12-13,1604 Padma I. 16. 6).

Omkara) from where Rudra is said to have burnt down with an arrow the three cities of Bāņāsura (Matsya 188.2 ft, Padma I. 15.2 ff), Sukla-tirtha (highly praised in Matsya 192.3 ff about which it is said that the rājar ṣi Canakya 1605 attained perfection there), Bhrgutirtha (at the very 1606 sight of which a man becomes free from sin, a bath in which leads to heaven and death at which ensures non-return to saṁsāra ), the Jāmadagnya-tirtha (where the Narmadā 1607 falls into the sea and where Lord Janārdana secured perfection). The mountain Amarakantaka is a tirtha that dispels all sins including brāhmana-murder and it is one yojana all round in extent (Matsya 189. 89, 98). The most important place on the Narmadā is, however, Māhismati, about the exact location of which scholars have differed. The general consensus of opinion is that Māhismati is to be identified with Omkāra Māndhātā, an island in the Narmadā about 40 miles south of Indore. It has a long history. Moggaliputta Tissa is said in Buddhist works to have sent missionaries to several countries in the reign of Asoka (about 247 B. C.), one of which was sent to Mahiṣamandala. Dr. Fleet in his paper Mahiga mandala and Māhismati' (in J.R. A, S, for 1910 pp. 425-447) assigns cogent reasons for identifying Mahigamandala and Māhismati. Māhismati was well-known to the Mahābhasya, 1608 from a passage in which it follows that by a forced march a person starting from Ujjayini could reach Māhismati the next morning. Kālidāsa describes it as surrounded by Revā (Raghuvamsa VI. 43). Māhismati is mentioned as being on

GODAVARĪ 

No mention of Godavari has so far been found in the Vedic Literature. In Buddhist works there are traditions about Bāvarī, who was a purohita of Mahākosala and then of Pasenadi, who resided in Assaka's territory in the vicinity of Alaka on the Godāvari and who is said to have sent several disciples to Buddha at Srāvasti (vide Suttanipāta, S. B. E. vol. X part 2 pp. 184 and 187). The Vārtika 'Sankhyāyā nadi-godāvari bhyām ca' on Pān. V. 4.75, expressly mentions Godāvari and has in view 'Saptagodāvara'. The two Epics and Purānas contain numerous references to it. The Vanaparva 1609 mentions it as a holy river in the south, abounding in gardens and full of water and resorted to by hermits performing austerities. The Aranyakānda of the Rāmāyana (13.13 and 21) speaks of the country well-known as 'Pañcavati' frequented by herds of deer which is near the Godavari and about two yojanas from Agas tya's hermitage. It is in the Brahmapurāņa that the Godāvari and the subsidiary tirthas on it have been lauded at great length in chapters 70-175. The Tirthasāra (a part of Nộsimha prasāda) quotes about 60 verses from chapters 89, 91, 106, 107, 116-118, 121, 122, 128, 131, 144, 154, 159, 172 of the Brahma purāṇa, which fact shows that the chapters on Gautamī in the present Brahmapurāṇa were part of the Brahmapurāṇa at least some centuries before 1500 A.D. Vide my paper in J.B.B.R.A.S. for 1917 p. 27-28. The Brahmapurāṇa generally refers to the Godāvarī as Gautami. 1610 It is stated by the Brahmapurāṇa that the Ganges to the south of the Vindhya mountain is called Gautami and to its north Bhāgirathi. The Godavari is said to be 200 yojanas long and there are three crores and a half of

tirthas on it. 1611 Dandakāranya is said to be the seed ( source or cause ) of dharma and mukti and the country embraced by the Gautami is specially the holiest. 1612 A verse occurring in several purāṇas states 'These countries (of Madhyadeśa) are immediately next to the mountain Sahya: thereon is Godāvari and that country is the most charming in the whole world. There is Govardhana there which is (like) Mandara and Gandhamādana’. 1613 Brahmapurāṇa (chapters 74-76) narrates how Gautama brought the Ganges from the matted hair of Siva to Brahmagiri where he had his hermitage and how Ganesa helped in the task by means of a ruse. The Nāradapurana (uttarārdha 72) narrates that no rain fell for 12 years while Gautama practised tapas, that owing to famine all sages came to Gautama's hermitage, that he brought Gangā to his hermi tage, that he sowed sāli grains in the morning and reaped the crop by midday, that this went on till there was plenty of rain and crops, that Siva appeared to him, that Gautama prayed that Siva should stay near his hermitage and that hence the hill on which Gautama had his hermitage came to be called Tryambaka (verse 24). Varāha (171. 37-44) also says that Gautama brought Jahnavi to Dandaka and the river became Godāvari. The Kūrma (II. 20. 29-35) mentions a long list of rivers and other sacred places and winds up by saying that the Godāvarī is pre-eminently a place for performing srāddha. It is stated in the Brahmapurāņa that for the removal of all kinds of distress two alone are declared (as the means) viz. the holy river Gautami or Siva who is full of compassion. 1614 The Brahmapurāṇa describes about a hundred tirthas on the Godāvari, such as Tryambaka (79.6), Kuśāvarta (80, 1-3), Janasthāna ( 88.1), Govardhana (chap. 91), Pravarāsangama

A few words must, however, be said about Nasik, Govardhana, Pañcavati and Janasthāna. Nasik must have existed at least 200 years before Christ. An Inscription on one pillar of the railing at Bharhut stūpa (about 200 B.C.) records the gift of Goraksitā of Nasik, the wife of Vasuka. 1616 This is the earliest certain historical reference to Nasik discovered so far. The Mahābhāsya 1617 speaks of Nasikya as a city. The Vāyu purāṇa (45.130) mentions Nāsikya as a country. The Nasik Inscriptions in the Pandulenā caves (Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 pp. 544-639 and E. I. vol. VIII pp. 59-96 edited by Senart) establish that Nasik was a prosperous place in the centuries before and after Christ. Ptolery (about 150 A. D.) mentions Nasika (Ptolemy p. 156). It is not possible for rea sons of space to go into the detailed history of Nasik, its bath ing places and pools, its temples, pilgrimages and rites of worship. For these one may consult the Bombay Gazetteer, vol. 

16 (for Nasik District). That volume states that there are about 60 temples in Nasik (pp. 503-512) and 16 in Pancavati and one the left bank of the Godāvari (pp. 512 ff.). But hardly any really old temple has survived. In 1680 A. D. twenty-five temples at Nasik were destroyed by the Deccan Viceroy of Aurangzeb. Almost all the large temples that adorn Nasik were built during the tinies of the Peshwas of Poona (1750 1818). Three temples are specially worthy of mention, viz. the the Rāmji temple in Pañcavati and Nāro Shankar's temple (or Bell temple) on the left bank of the Godāvarī near the first crossing and that of Sundara-nārāyana in Aditwar Peth at Nasik (p. 503).

place is a much frequented place. Not far from the Sitā-gumphā is the temple of Kālā Rāma, one of the finest modern temples in Western India. There are numerous bathing places and sacred pools (kundas) between Govardhana (6 miles to the west of Nasik) and Tapovana (11 miles to south-east of Nasik). Vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 pp. 522-526. The holiest spot in Nasik is the Rāmakunda near the left bank of the Godavari where it takes its first bend to the south. For the Kālārama daily services and the rites pilgrims have to perform at Nasik, vide Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 pp. 517-518 and 529-531 respectively. Rāmanavami is one of the great religious festivals at Nasik. 

Govardhana town occurs several times in the long and famous Nasik Inscription of Uṣavadāta (No. 10 in Bombay Gazetteer vol. 16 p. 569-70). 1618 As regards Pañcavați the place still goes by the same name. It is to be noted that in the Rāmāyana III. 13.13 Pañcavati is styled a desa (country). Janasthāna was in Dandakāraṇya according to the Salyaparva 39. 9-10, Rām. III. 21. 19-20, Nāradiya-purāṇa II. 75. 30 and Agni 7.2–3 1619 and Pañcavati was part of Janasthāna. Jana - sthāna is said to be four yojanas in extent, and it is further stated that it was so called because kings of the Janaka line secured mukti there through the favour of the Godavari, 1620

meritorious, 1621 The Brahmapurana says that three crores and a half of tirthas that exist in the three worlds come for a bath in the Gangā when Jupiter is in Leo and that bathing in the Bhāgirathi ( every day ) for sixty thousand years ( is equal) to bathing only once in the Godavari when Jupiter is in the Zodical sign Leo. 1622 It is stated in the Varāhapurāṇa that when a man repairs to the sacred Godāvari in simhastha year, takes a bath and offers tarpana (and śrāddha) to his pitrs the latter go to heaven if they are in hell and they attain final release if they are already denizens of heaven, Jupiter is in Leo for one year once in twelve years. Crowds of pilgrims throng at Nasik in their thousands from all parts of India in the simhastha year. 

KANCĪ (modern Conjeeveram ). Kāñci is one of the seven holy cities of India (vide p. 678 n. 1535 above ) and one of the most ancient towns in southern India. If we rely on the tradition recorded by Hiouen Thsang who stayed in Kāñci about 640 A. D. it would follow that Buddha frequented the region around Kāñcīpura and that Kañci had a stūpa about 100 feet high built by Asokaraja (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II, p. 230). Hiouen Thsang informs us that Kāñcī was 30 li (or about 5 miles ) in circuit, that in his day there were eighty Deva temples and that there were many heretics called Nirgranthas (Beal's B. R. W. W. vol. II, pp. 228-229 ). The next important daturn is the mention of Kāñci-puraka (resident of Kancipura) in the Mahābhāsya on Vārtika 26 to Pān. IV. 2. 104 (Kielhorn, vol. II. p. 298). Several early records relating to the ancient history of the Pallavas of Kāñci (of about 250 to 350 A. D.) have been published, such as the Mavidavolu plates of Yuvamahārāja Siva-skandavarman (E.I. yol. VI p. 84), the Hirahadagalli Inscription of the 8th year (E. I vol. 1. p.2), and the Talgunda Fillar Inscription of Kadamba Kākusthavarman (E. I. vol. VIII p. 24). The

Allahabad Prasasti of Samudragupta (Gupta Inscriptions ed. by Fleet p. 7) states that Samudragupta vanquished Viṣnugopa, king of Kāñci (Kāñceyaka), in the first half of the 4th century A. D. In the 'Manimekhalai' there is an elaborate description of the town of Kāñci where Manimekhalai ultimately attained to enlightenment (vide S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar's 'Mani mekhalai in its historical setting' p. 20). It is not necessary for the present purpose to refer to the numerous inscriptions about the Pallavas and Kāñci and the large number of papers contributed to learned Journals. Reference may, however, be made to the careful and scholarly work "History of the Pallavas of Kāñci' by R. Gopalan (1928), which brings together all relevant data published up to the date of its composition, 

Let us now turn to some passages from the Purāņas about Kāñcī. The Brahmānda asserts : 1623 The two cities of Kasi and Kāñci are the two eyes of Lord Siva; Kāñci is a famous Vaisnava kṣetra but it also brings about the presence of Siva'. It is stated in the Bārhaspatya-sutra (III. 124) that Kāñci is a Sākta-kṣetra and in the Devibhāgavata (VII. 38. 8) it is said to be a Devīsthāna called Annapurna. The Vāmana-purana 1624 observes: the Jāti is the best among flowers, Kāñcī the best among towns, Rambhā among women, the householder among persons of (the four) asramas, Kusasthali is the best among cities and Madhyadesa among all countries, 

Kāñci is full of temples and shrines. The most famous are the Vaikuntha Perumal temple of Visnu and the Saiva temple of Kailasanatha built by Pallava Rājasimha. This latter has a large hall supposed to contain 1000 columns 1625 There is an old Jaina temple also.

every year. The Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20 (for Sholapur District) devotes pp. 415-482 to Pandharpur. This sacred place cannot claim very great antiquity. On the materials so far available it is difficult to decide when the shrine of Vithobā was established, but there is sufficient evidence to enable one to say that it was certainly in existence in the middle of the thirteenth century A. D.1626 The Padmapurāņa (Uttara-khanda 176. 56-58 ) mentions the image of Vitthala Visnu on the bank of the Bhimarathi which has only two arms and is called Bindu-madhava. The difficulty is about the date of this part of the Padmapurana. In my opinion it is a late addition and cannot be placed earlier than about 1000 A.D. The modern town of Pandharpur lies along the right bank of the Bhima river. The chief temple in Pandharpur is that of Vithoba in the centre of that part of the town which is considered holy. The Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20 describes at some length (pp. 417-424) the main temple of Vithobā and its adjoining parts. Behind the temple of Vithobā is the temple of Rakhumai, the consort of Vithobā. There is a large staff of priests and attendants in the temple of Vithobā, the chief of whom are those called Badves (who are the most numerous body of the staff and who once claimed to be owners of the temple, but who are now held to be the trustees and guardians of the temple pro perty and of the god's jewels under a scheme of management framed by the High Court of Bombay).1627 Except the Badves all

In Sakharam Bhimaji Benare and others versus Gangaram Babaji Badve and others, Printed Judgments of the Bombay High Court for 1896 p. 644, the position set out above was accepted by both sides and a scheme of management was framed by the High Court (pp. 649-651) which provided for the creation of a Vithobā Fund, for the appointment of a committee of management con sisting of five Badves to be elected every year, for the keeping of accounts by the Badves, and for the auditing of these accounts by a Devasthan.com - mittee and declared that any cash offering exceeding Rs. 500 was not to be appropriated by the Badves for their own use, but was to expended for ornaments for the image and to be added to the Vithobe fand, if not so required.

other attendants are called sevādhāris and they are of various grades, viz. the pujāris (who take the principal part in the worship of the God), Benaris 1628 (who repeat mantras and hymns at different services), paricārakas (who bring in a large silver dish the water with which the pujāri washes the image of the God and brings the lamp for waving it before the image at the evening and night services), haridās (who sings generally five verses in honour of the god at the morning, evening and night services), the dingres (who hold a mirror before the God at the early morning service after the god has been dressed and before the lights are waved), the divtes (the torch-bearers) who hold a lighted torch when the last night ceremonies are over and carry the slippers of the god in torch-light processions three times a year on the Full Moon days of Āsādha and Kārtika and on the Dasrā night), the dange (who stands with a silver or gold plated mace outside the ante-chamber at the morning, evening and night services). The goddess Rakhumāi has only one set of priests known as Utpāts, of whom there are over a hundred families. 

The Bombay Gazetteer describes at length (pp. 427-430) the ordinary and special services in the temple of Vithobā which are passed over here. Their essence is that the god is treated as if he were some high human person requiring bath, dress, songs, sleep against fatigue and so on. One thing, how ever, may be noticed that no women singers or dancers are connected with this temple of Vithobā in contradistinction to many temples in the Deccan and South India. 

The image of Vitthal or Vithobā in the temple is about three feet and nine inches high and together with its base seems to be cut out of one block of trap. Its rough appearance is probably due to the effect of time. The image is standing with its arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips; the left

Vithoba Image at Pandharpur 

715 

Kantak, the writer of the note on Pandharpur in the Bombay Gazetteer vol. 20, remarks (p. 424): "The dress and ornament of the image belong to a (time) little later than the Guptas, probably not later than the 5th or 6th century after Christ. As far as is known no other existing Vaisnava temple in India has an image of Visnu like the Pandharpur image, but there are two similar images of the third century after Christ in the Udayagiri brahmanical caves near Bhilsā ...... Like the Pan dharpur image these are both standing figures with arms akimbo and hands resting on the hips and a conch and discus in the hands". Formerly pilgrims used to embrace the image and also touched the feet of the image. But since about 1873 the feet alone are allowed to be touched. 

The Bombay Gazetteer (vol. 20 p. 431, note 2) states that the image of Vithobā was removed to various places at diffe rent times to save it from sacrilege by fanatic Moslem invaderg and rulers. About 500 yards east of Vithobā's temple in the bed of the Bhīmā river is the temple of Pundlik, one of the most favourite places of Worship in Pandharpur. This last temple is not that of a god. It oply marks the spot where Pundlik, a great devotee of Vitthal, spent his last days and died. Pundlik was probably a brāhmaṇa from Pandharpur, originally an undutiful son who ill-treated his parents, but who later repented on seeing the dutiful cobbler Rohidās, changed his ways and became a very dutiful son, so much so that tradition says that god Vithobā came to visit him. Vithoba and Pundlik have become so much coupled together that all pilgrims before beginning to dine and on other occasions shout the cry 

Pundalika varade Hari Vitthal' 1629. The Bom. G. vol. 20 (pp. 432-434) describes the temple of Pundlik and narrates the traditional story about him. 

1629. The writer in Bom. G. vol. 20 translates the words tuertehara Eit fag as 'O! Pundalika, grant us a boon, Hari Vithal!'. This translation does not appear to me to be correct. The cry is also in the form 'guenta atet e raga: (which is the correct one). In my opinion art fagy is only a vocative and the correct form is qu a ter (for ware) and the whole cry means 'O Hari Vithall that didst grant a boon to Pundalika'. Mr. A.

Pages 434-468 of Bom. G. vol. 20 describe the several temples and shrines at Pandharpur such as those of Visnupada, Trimbakeśvara, Candrabhāgā, Janābai's cell, which are all passed over here. The river Bhimā is styled Candrabhāgā within Pandharpur limits and its water is believed to possess sin-purifying power. 

Several important and controversial questions arise in relation to Vithobā's temple at Pandharpur; viz, the date when the image of Vithobā was installed in the temple at Pandharpur, whether the present image is an old one or a substitute, what the ancient name of Pandharpur was, the derivation of the word 'Vitthal'. As regards the first question it may be stated that there is not enough evidence to establish with certainty the time when the image was established 1630 But some of the items of evidence may be briefly set out here. In I. A. vol. 14 pp. 68-75 Prof. K. B. Pathak published an inscription on a copper plate found at Bendigere (about eleven miles south-east from Belgaum), the inscription being dated in sake 1171 (1249 A. D.), in which Pandharpur is called Pauņdarikakṣetra on the Bhima rathi (at p. 74) and Vithobā is called Viṣņu and which records the grant of a village in Venugrāma district (Belgaum) to a number of brāhmanas by a minister of Yadava king Krsna (or Kanhara in the inscription) in the presence of god Visnu (p. 74) i.e. before the image of Visnu or Vitthala. Dr. R. G. Bhandarkar in Vaisnavism, Saivism &c.'. (p. 88) and in History of the Deccan' (2nd ed. p. 115-6) refers to an inscription on stone dated sake 1192 (1270 A. D.) in Pandharpur itself, in which Bhānu, son of Keśava, is represented as having performed the Aptoryāma sacrifice in Pandurangapura 'on account of which crowds and Vitthala were greatly pleased'. There is another earlier inscription in the temple of Vithobā on three sides of a stone beam in a sopā beyond the mandapa (porch) of 16 pillars, the script being Devanagari and the language being partly Sanskrit and partly Canarese. It was issued in sake 1159 (1237 A, D.) by Hoysala king Someśvara and records the grant of an agrahāra to God Vitthaladeva who resides in a great village called Pandarage situated on the Bhimarathi river and who

made the heart of sage (muni) Pundarika expand (with devotion). Vide Bom. G. vol. 20 pp. 419-420 and pp. 4-6 of Mr. Khare's monograph (on medieval references). The Mysore Archaeo logical Survey Report for 1929 (pp. 197-210) publishes a copper plate inscription issued by the Rāstrakūta king Avidheya which records a grant of Pandaranga-palli and four other villages situated to the east of Mahādeva hill to a brāhmana named Jayad-vittha. This grant was confirmed about 820 A. D. by Rāstrakūta king Sarvarasa (i. e. Amoghavarṣa I). The editor Dr. Krishna is of opinion that the date of the inscription must be 516 A. D. (ibid. p. 203). Therefore the important con clusion follows that Pandharpur was known to Canarese people as Pandarage and was also called Pandarangapalli. This in scription does not expressly refer to god Vitthala, but the donee's name Jayad-vittha contains the part Vittha which is most probably an early form of Vitthala. 

In a work called 'Vitthalabhusana' 1631 by one Gopalacārya about eleven verses are quoted from Hemādri on Tirtha which are quoted below 1632. Briefly they state : an excellent tirtha ex

ists on the southern bank of the river Bhaimi and there is also a rare but fine image there; it is called Paundarika kṣetra and the greatest of gods viz. Pānduranga worshipped by the whole kṣetra resides there. It is three times holier than Puskara, six and ten times holier than Kedara and Vārānasi respectively. Pundarika practised severe austerities at the end of Dvāparayuga in the 28th Kalpa and always devotedly attended upon his parents. God Krsna who was making a herd of cows graze on Govardhana hill became pleased with him for his devotion to his parents, Krsna who wields a stick for driving cows, who has bracelets rendered bright by (the colour) of the umbrella 1633 ( shade), who is adorned with a head-gear (mukuta) and a śikya ( a loop ) scintilating with the lustre of many jewels, who was very charming and had armlets studded with jewels, who does not (appear to ) wear any dhoti, but has his loins covered with nickers, who is set off by a girdle of three strings tied on his waist and who stands with arms akimbo and appears possessed of three lines on his belly. Though a ms. of the Tirtha portion of Hemadri's work has not yet been recovered, there is no reason to doubt that the verses were taken by Gopālācārya from Hemādri's work, particularly when almost all those verses are quoted by the T. S. (about 1500 A. D.) from the Skandapurana and Kurmapurana. As Hemādri composed his work about 1260 to 1270 A. D. and as the verses quoted by him are cited from the Skandapurāṇa, it follows that several centuries before 1260 A. D. Pandharpur was known as a tirtha, that the devotee and saint Pundarika. (Marāthi 'Pundlik') also was so known then and that the image of Vithobā was essentially the same in appearance as it is now. That Pandharpur had risen in sanctity and importance in the 15th century follows from the fact that both the great Vaignava saints, Caitanya and Vallabha, visited it. Vide Prof. S. K. De's 'Vaisnava faith and movement in Bengal'p. 71 for

It has to be noted that गुह्यसूत्रेण or अन्तःसूत्रेण is mentioned separately from कतिबन्धेन and there. fore गृह्यसूत्र or अन्तःसूत्र was something different from कटिबन्ध (waist-band), Probably the original reading was दिग्वासाश्वातिसूक्ष्मेण गुह्यसूत्रेण for दिवासा श्वातिसौम्येन, where सौम्य conveys very little sense.

Caitanya's visit and 'Sri Vallabhāchārya' by Manilal C. Parekh (pp. 56-59 ) for Vallabhācārya's visit. 

It has been already shown from the Bombay Gazetteer that there is a tradition about the image having been removed several times and brought back. On pp. 16-25 of his work. Mr. Khare cites various passages from medieval writers in Sanskrit, Marathi and Canarese and comes to the conclusion that the present image is not only not the ancient one but that it was not there in the 17th century, since the characteristics of the present image do not tally with the description contained in the poems of saint Tukārām. I do not agree with his conclusions. He has overlooked several weighty considerations. He has relied upon inferences drawn from the presence of Afzulkhan and the bigoted emperor Aurangzeb in the Deccan. I have cited above (pp. 632, 692) references to the demolition of North Indian temples and images on the orders of Aurangzeb, but Mr. Khare has been unable to show any direct reference to the demolition of the temple or the image of Vithobā on the orders of any Moslem king or officer 1634 We cannot rely on mere inferences or not properly authenticated letters or verses. Besides, the present image is so much worn that unless one very carefully 

was 

1634. It may, however, be stated that there is some evidence that efforts were made to demolish the temple of Vithoba by some Moslem king of Bidar and that the Badves (the guardians of the Pandhari temple ) fearing destruction of the image removed it and concealed it somewhere else. In a Marathi work called 'RETIEHETETrat yang by Mr. Narayan Krishna Gadre (1905) p. 168 verses are cited from a life (completed in sake 1667 i. e. 1745 A. D.) of one Changā Mudhesa ( who died in sake 1427 i. e. 1505 A.D.) written by his descendant Shamji Gosavi Vanjarkhede (who was 11th in descent from Changa Mudheśa). The Marathi verses are: बेटरीचा राजा बामणी पातशहा। ब्राह्मणासी बहु छळियेलें। हिंदुधर्म जितुके तितके वर्जियेले ॥ राऊळ विध्वंसिलें पंढरीचे॥ केलीसे मशीद महाद्वार मोडून । सातमास पूर्ण झाले यासी॥ EN HETHET 31 IT T Sadi wa miefill verses 52-55 of the 7th chapter of the life. This was written two hundred and forty years after the alleged vandalism. Besides the same work mentions in verse 94 (chap. 7) that Changadeva thought that the mosque should be demolished and a new temple (a complete replica of the old one) should be built. Similarly, in istaafa ECT part 1 p. 68 (published by the Bharata-itihāsa-samsodhaka mandala of Poona) there is a letter dated in 1581 sake (i. e. 1659-60 A.D.) in Marathi which states that Shivaji killed Afjalakhan who had rerhovedbe image of Vitthal at Pandharpur and that at Tuljāpur. The letter is dat properly authenticated and is not a reliable piece of evidence. I am obliged to Mr. G. H. Khare of Poona for drawing my attention to these two pieces of evidence,

scrutinizes, it would be difficult to pronounce what articles it holds or what dress it wears. Therefore, there is great scope for differences of opinion on the characteristic features of the present image. Conceding for argument that the tradition about the removal of the idol is true, that does not establish that the present image is different from the one that existed in the 13th century or before. The present image has an elongat ed head dress which some may construe as a simple mukuta (crown) with a rim: but the pujāris and common people regard it as a Sivalinga and the rim as the rope of the šikya that is carried on the back (by cowherds ). The present image has ear-rings (as Mr. Khare admits ) but they are so long that they rest on the shoulders. The present image has angadas (armlets) on the upper arms ( and that is the description in the Skanda-purāņa quoted by Hemādri). The present image has ornaments on the wrists (which the passage from the Skandapurāņa also mentions). There is a girdle with three strings on the waist of the present image (in Sk, also we have trivrtenānukālena katibaddhena or katibandhena rājitah'). The present image 1635 does not clearly show that a dhoti was worn (and therefore one reading of the Skanda says that it is 'digvāsāh') but the Skanda adds that the image has arms akimbo. In my opinion the description in the Skanda. purāṇa (which must be held to be at least not later than about 1000 A. D.) tallies in essential particulars with the present image; therefore it follows that sufficient evidence has not been adduced to show that it is comparatively a new image and the proposition of Mr. Khare that it is a different one from the original should be held not proved. In the descriptions given by Tukārām and others (p. 22 of Mr. Khare's book ) actual, legendary and ideal elements are mixed up. For example, Tukārām states that the god has 16000 wives (Mr. Khare's book 

1635. Persons not familiar with ancient images or statues in stone might think that an image or statue is naked (digvāsah) when as a matter of fact the sculpture itself shows that the image wears a dhoti and waistband and yet its private parts are shown as visible, probably because it was the intention of the sculptor to indicate that the garment was made of the finest texture and was transparent. For example, in 'History of Fine Art in India and Ceylon' by Vincent Smith, there is a figure of a Bodhisattva-tion p. 143 No. 94 ) which is clearly draped in a dhoti and waistband and then 

parts of which are yet visible. The Visnu image from M burji (Plate VI) in a paper on Gupta Art in Journal of U. P. Historical Society vol. 18 pp. 101-134 shows similar characteristics.

p. 22 Bailā sola hajāra' &c.). But Tukārām does mention the facts that the arms are akimbo, that there is no dhoti (digambara), and mentions the existence of a śikya, a stick, also a girdle and ornaments. Lastly, Mr. Khare does not attach sufficient importance to two facts, one being that about 1873 two Gosavis damaged the image which was later re-installed and pilgrims were forbidden from embracing it. It is quite possible that some of the features already indistinct were lost in these happenings (vide Bom. G. vol. 20 p. 430). Besides, for hundreds of years the image has been washed with pañcāmsta (milk, curds, ghee, honey and sugar) and water at least once every day and sometimes several times a day. It is not difficult to imagine that the characteristic marks became blurred by these continual baths. 

Some other matters require to be dealt with. The image is variously called viz. Pāņduranga, Pandhari, Vitthal, Vitthalanātha and Vithobā. 

- Visņu assumes in Prakrit the forms Viņhu, Viņņu, Venhu, Vetha and others. In Canarese Visnu becomes Bitti, Bittiga, Vitta &o. The changes in names do not necessarily follow the rules laid down in Prakrit or Canarese grammars, which rules themselves are often based on meagre data and Mr. A. K. Priyolkar in his learned paper on 'Bhagat Namdeo of the Sikhs' in the Journal of the University of Bombay vol. VII part 2 (1938) points out (p. 24) that in the Ādi Granth of the Sikhs, in the hymns of Namdeo, God is addressed as ‘Bithal' or 'Bithalu' (p. 24), that, in the Gujarati poems of Narsinh Mehta and Mirabai, God is addressed as Vitthala (p. 35) and Vitthala is employed by these saints meaning only Viṣnu and not the deity at Pandharpur. The learned Kāģinātha Upadhyāya, author of Vitthala-rn-mantrasāra-bhāṣya, derives the word Vitthala as (Vit+tha+la) 1636. 

As regards the name of the ksetra it appears that origi nally it was called in Canarese Pandarage, of which Pāņdu ranga is a sanskritized form. When Pundlik, the devotee of Vitthal, became famous the sacred place came to be called Pundarikapura (as in Kūrma) and Paundarikapura (as in Skanda). Vide note 1632 above.

Irof The pilgrims to Pandharpur may be divided into two classes, regular visitors and occasional visitors. The first class comprise those called Vārkaris (lit. those who keep the fixed times). The Vārkaris are of two sorts viz. those who attend every month and those who attend twice a year on the 11th of Asādha-sukla and Kārtika-sukla). This cult of vārkaris has been a great leveller. In theory and to a large extent in practice it ignores caste exclusiveness. A brāhmana vārkari falls at the feet of a sūdra vārkari. There are certain obser vances binding on all vārkarīs (for which, vide Bom, G. vol. 20 p. 471). The vārkari carries a rosary of Tulasi (basil) beads, foregoes flesh-eating, observes a fast on ekādasī, carries an ochre-coloured patākā (swallow-tailed banner) and is to speak the truth (and not to cheat) when engaged in his daily occupations. diw. Bodo 

Some people think that the image of Vithobā is really Buddhist or Jain. There is hardly any evidence for this. When such Marathi poets and saints as Ekanatha, and Tukārām speak. of Vithobā as Bauddhāvatāra they have Visnu in mind, 1637 whose 9th avatāra was Buddha according to the Purāņas and medieval writers.

This is merely a list of tirthas from the point of view of Dharmaśāstra and not a treatise on the Ancient Geography of India. The result is that many countries and towns that have no importance or claims as tirthas have been altogether omitted. Bauddha and Jain works on tirthas have only rarely been referred to. Many of the Purānas enumerate the moun tains and rivers of dvipas and var ṣas other than those of Jambudvipa and Bhārata-varsa such as Harivarṣa, Ramyaka varsa, Krauñcadvipa, Sālmalidvipa, but they have been exclud ed from this list. The Brahmapurāņa (chap. 26 verses 8-83) contains a string of over 520 tirthas without hardly any certain indication of their location and the Bhīṣmaparva in chap. 9 mentions about 160 rivers with practically no indication about their location in most cases. Similarly, the Garuda (I. 81. 1-31) enumerates about 200 and Padma (VI. 129) contains 108 tirtha names. In Banaras alone I have listed about 350 sub tirthas. But there are about 1500 shrines and temples in Banaras alone. These have not been included. Each great tirtha has numerous sub-tirthas as in the Varāha-purāṇa under Mathurā, in Brahma-purāṇa under Gautami, in Vāyu-purāṇa under Gayā. Through sheer weariness or inadvertence some of these must have been left out by me and some were left out purposely on account of the absence of any importance. Besides, several tirthas that are regarded as sacred by modern people are not so treated in the Epics or purāṇas and are not even mentioned in them; many of these have been omitted in this list. Our authorities are often very vague about the location or extent of tirthas. Moreover, a number of tirthas scattered in different parts of India bear the same name (e. g. vide under Agnitirtha, Koțitirtha, Cakratīrtha, Varāhatirtha, Somatirtha). I am under great obligations to Cunningham's *Ancient Geography of India' (ed, of 1872) and to Nundo Lal Dey's 'The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient and Medieval India' (1927). I have had occasions to differ from both, particularly from the latter. But, the space at my disposal being very limited, I could not enter into even brief discussions

in support of my views. It would look ungrateful to find fault with the work of Dey; but it must be said that he relies too much on rather old and antiquated authorities and has not cast his net over a wide area. Often times he mentions no original authorities (vide, for example, Cakratirtha on p. 43). He is very vague in his references. He hardly ever cites the number of the verse on which he relies and often omits to specify even the part or section of the work relied upon. For example, at p. 13 as regards Avanti he mentions Panini IV. 176, which should be IV. 1. 176. Further, he has omitted several well-known tirthas (e. g. Daśāśvamedhika). He is sometimes wrong in what he says. On p. 54 he states that Kiskindha kānda 43 refers to Devadāruvana as a proper name, but there the context ('lodhrapadmaka-sandesu devadāruvanesu ca' in verse 15) shows that what is meant is 'forests of Deodar trees'). On p. 73 he says Bharatavarṣa was first called Haimavata varsa, but the passage of the Lingapurāņa (I. 49.7) on which he relies (idam haimavatam varsam Bhāratam nāma visrutam) does not bear that out. There is no reference to a prior account here and all that is meant is that Bhāratavarsa is connected with Himavat, as a previous passage (I. 47. 23 Himādrer dakṣiņam varṣam Bharatāya nyavédayat) expressly states that Bhāratávarsa is to the south of Himālaya. In Salya 44.52 Sarasvati is called Haimavati, but that does not mean that Haimavati was the name of Sarasvati in far-off ages. It simply means that it rises in Himayat range.' Only a comparison of the list prepared by me with Dey's work will show the differ ence in details between the two. I should not undertake that task and leave it to scholarly readers. 

I have carefully read the two Epics and most of the Purānas. But I do not cite exhaustive references to all the texts where a particular tirtha is mentioned. I feel satisfied with mentioning two or three. Owing to the several restric tions imposed upon myself this list cannot claim to be thoroughly exhaustive. But I hope that it is comprehensive enough and far larger and more informative than any list of tirthas presented by any scholar so far. There is ample scope for industrious scholars to improve upon and to add to this lista have included important tirthas from Kashmir and given copious references to the Nilamata-purāņa, the Rāja-tarangiņi and the si Hara-carita-cintāmaņi. I am highly obliged to the Kashmir Report of Dr. Bühler (published as a special number for 187 Cient

by the B BRAS), to Stein's notes in his translation of the Rāja-tarangini and his memoir on the Ancient Geography of Kashmir published separately (and also embodied in the 2nd volume of the translation of Kalhana's work). All the names of tirthas are transliterated into the English alphabet and arranged according to the English mode of spelling. For the Mahābhārata references are given to the oblong Bombay edition and by citing names of parvans, but in the case of the Rāmāyana Roman figures I to VII are employed for the Bāla, Ayodhyā, Aranya, Kiskindhā, Sundara, Yuddha and Uttara kāndas respectively. For the Rāmāyaṇa I have used the edition brought out by the Madras Law Journal Press in 1933. Among Purānas the Anandāśrama editions of the Agni, Brahma, Brahmavaivarta, Matsya, Vāyu and Padma have been relied upon and as to the rest of the Mahāpurāņas the Venkate śvara Press editions have been used (except in the case of the Nrasimhapurāņa of which the edition of Messrs. Gopal Narayan & Co. and the Bhāgavatapurāṇa, of which the Nirnayasagara edition of the bare text have been referred to). The Skandapurāņa has been a source of great trouble and labour. Owing to the limited time at my disposal I have not been able to digest thoroughly the ninety thousand and odd verses of that purāņa, though I have very carefully gone into the Kāśikhanda and some other khandas. Besides, there are two separate recensions of the Skanda and large portions of it appear to be apocryphal and later additions. The seven big sections of the Skanda viz. Maheśvarakhanda, Vaiṣpava, Brāhma, Kāśi, Avantya, Nāgara, Prabhāsa are indicated by Roman figures from I to VII and the sub-sections by Arabic figures. Some of these sub-sections have further sub-divisions into Pūrvārdha and Uttarārdha. 

BUD 

on I have made endeavours to locate the tirthas as far as possible. Inscriptions have been drawn upon in several cases for locating the tirthas and for their antiquities and history. The principal Sanskrit authorities (except Kalhana) are often very vague as compared with even foreign writers like Hiouen Thsang, Alberuni and Abul Fazal. Where I was not myself sure I have given references to the texts alone, and in some cases to the views of Cunningham, Dey, Pargiterband others. If the same name happens to be given to different firth as located at different places, I have indicated the several different places bearing the same name by employing the capital letters

A, B, C and so on. I may state that I have hardly ever remained content by borrowing references to Sanskrit authorities given by my predecessors, but have seen personally each reference to Sanskrit works except where I expressly state from whom I borrow a particular reference. Sorensen's Index of the Mahābhārata and the Vedic Index of Macdonell and Keith have been used in several places. I have also derived material help from the volumes of the Imperial Gazetteer and from the several volunies of the Bombay Gazetteer. The same may be said about Wilson's translation of Visnupurāṇa (ed. by Hall, 1864-1877), Pargiter's notes to his translation of the Mārkan. deyapurāņa, Dr. B. C. Law's paper on the mountains and rivers of India' in the Journal of the Department of Letters, Calcutta University, vol. 28 and Dr. Hemchandra Raychaud huri's 'Studies in Indian Antiquities' (1932), and the paper on 'Ancient towns and cities in Gujarat and Kathiawad' in I. A. vol. 54. I have consulted only a few Māhātmyas of tirthas. Recently, Prof. V. R. Ramchandra Dikshitar of Madras has published a useful work "The Purāņa Index' (volumes I and II covering over 1400 pages) which collects material from five Purānas only viz. the Bhāgavata, Brahmānda, Matsya, Vāyu and Visnu. The two volumes reach up to the Sanskrit letter 'ma' only. I, for my part, do not agree with much that he says about the age of the Purānas in general and of the five Purānas (which he has digested) in particular, but this is not the place to go into that question. Besides, his work has to be used with some caution. In several places the work is misleading. To take only a fe examples. On p. 547 he lists "Godhūma', makes the remark ‘fit for śrāddha' and cites four references from the Viṣnupurāņa alone. One may prima facie think that Godhūma is here some place fit for śrāddha. As a matter of fact in all the references from the Viṣnupurāņa 'Godhūma' means 'wheat' and nothing more, which no doubt is fit food for śrāddha. But other fit things such as 'ikṣu' (declared to be fit for sraddha by Vāyu 78. -8) are not included at all. On p. 123 A.śokavana is not a proper name, but only a forest of Asoka trees, as the preceding word 'drāksāvana' (in Vāyu 38. 68) indicates. So also Kamala prabhava (not 'prabhavā' as printed on p. 316 of vol. I) is not a river (in Matsya 163. 62, Anandaśrama ed.) but is only a sus adjective of the word Sona that follows. On p. 316 of vol. II Hobb states that the river Pārā rises from Rsyavān, but the Matsya round 114, 24 on which he relies says it springs from Pāriyātra. On the same page he gives the entry "Pārāvāratata sacred to darkar Oriental

Mata'. This makes no sense. Pārāvāratata would mean 'the shore of the sea'. What is really meant is that Devi is styled or worshipped as Pārā on the bank of the Pārā river (Pārā Pārātate mata). He does not compare the readings of the several printed editions of the five pürānas. Besides, the information furnished is very meagre. If the whole had been printed in a compact form far more information could have been given in the same number of pages. 

In some places I have indicated the rewards promised for bathing in the tirthas; but I have not done so in every case. The purāṇas promise one or more of the following rewards viz. the same merit as the performance of Aśvamedha or Vājapeya or other solemn Vedic sacrifices or reaching the highest worlds such as those of Brahmā, Visnu or Siva, the destruction of the gravest sins such as brāhmaṇa murder, the same merit as arises from gifts of a thousand cows &c. 

Many of the doubts and difficulties about the identification of several tīrthas can, if at all, be solved only by means of actual journeys to various places and investigations on the spot. That is a task which would require for its proper accom plishment a team of workers. A single individual can hardly attempt such a task with his own resources. 

ul This list will, it is hoped, be of some use in elucidating several problems such as the questions about the relative anti quity of the purāṇas, the dates of several Sanskrit works which mention the tirthas and the questions about borrowing on the part of purāņas among themselves and from the Mahābhārata.

Panini probably mentions some river in the Panjab. Dey p. 55 says that the southern portion of Sarayü is called Devika or Devā. Vām. 84. 12 refers to Devikatirtha brāhmanas, SK. VII Prabhasa-mahatmya, chap. 278. 66 67 speak of Mülasthana (modern Multan) as situated on the Devika : P. I, 25. 9-14 (5 yojanas long and

three miles from Kodinar is sur rounded by the ruins of a temple which popular Hindu belief declares to be the original Dvārakā, where Krsna resided and whence transferred himself to Dvāraka in Okhamandala. Vide Bombay Gazetteer, vol. VIII. (on Kathiawar) pp. 518-520 for Kodinar and p.552 for Mula Dvārakā. It was founded by Krsna (with Rai vataka as a park and Gomanta as a hill) owing to constant invasions and harassment by Jarāsandba; it was two yojanas long and one yojana broad. Vide Sabhāparva 14.49-55. The Var. (149, 7-8) makes it 10 yoja nas long and 5 broad. Vide p. 688 above under Mathurā. B (14. 54-56) says that the Vrsnis and Andhakas left Mathurā through fear of Kālay avana, took counsel with Krsna, ran to Kusasthali and built up Dvārakā: Vi. V. 23. 13-15. B 196. 13-15 say that Krsna begged of the ocean a strip of twelve yojanas, built Dvāraka with large parks, mansions and strong walls and established the people of Mathura there. When Krsna passed away, the city was flooded by the sea and swept away. as stated in a prophetic vein by Mausala-parva 6.23-24 and 7. 41-42. B 210.55 and 212.9. Vide also Vi. V.38.9 (the whole of Dvārakā except Krsna's palace was swept by the sea) and BV IV. 129.44 (except Rukmi. ni's palace). It is called the capital of Anarta (Udyoga 7. 6) and was first called Kusasthali (Sabhā 14. 50). Vide M 69.9=P. V. 23.10, B. 7.29 32 and Ag. 273. 12 (Kusasthali being the earlier name of the capital). The present Dvāraka is near Okha in Kathiawar. The Harivamsa II (Visnu parva) chapters 58 and 98 deal with the founding of Dvārakā. Some an cient Jain works like the Uttaradhy ayanasutra (SBE. vol. 45 p.115) men tion Dvārakā and Raivataka park 

(Girnar). The Jatakas also refer to Dvārakā. Vide Dr. B. C. Law's work on 'India as described in early texts of Buddhism and Jainism' pp. 102,239. The Prabhāsakhanda of the SK has a sub-section on Dvāraka in 44 chap ters and over 2000 verses for the glorification of Dvārakā. It says "the reward that is secured by (pilgri mage to) Vārānasi, Kuruksetra and Narmada can be secured at Dvāraka in half a twinkle (4. 52)": "Pilgri mage to Dvarakā is the 4th means of mukti. Man secures mukti by acquiring correct knowledge about Brahman or by dying at Prayaga or by mere bath in Gomati near Krsna" (SK. VII. 4. 4. 97-98). The BV. (Krsnajanmakhanda, Uttarardha chap. 103) has a hyperbolical descrip tion of the creation of Dvaraka, which is said to have been one hundred yojanas in extent. There is a work called Dvāraka-pattalaka compiled by Binābāyi (the only Ms, of which is the one at B.O.R.I. in Poona) which has been published by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri (1940). The Ms. is dated samvat 1574 (1518 A. D). It summarises the Dvāraka māhātmya in SK, A pilgrim on reach ing Dvārakā first worships Ganesa, then Balarama and then Krsna; he visits Rukmini's temple on the 8th, 9th or 14th tithi, then visits Cakra tirtha, then Dvārakā Gangā, then Sankhoddbāra, then tathes in the Gomati. The temple of Dvāraka natha is on the north bank of the Gomati creek. The main temple has five stories, is about 100 feet high from the ground and is sur mounted by a conical spire rising to about 150 feet. Vide D . D. Pusalkar's paper in that DOP) C.

Barnett) in E, I, XIIL p. 150 it is stated that Candrika. daughter of the Ganga king Ananga Bhima and widow of Haihaya prince Paramardin, built a temple of Visnu at Ekamra. In that inscrip tion among other matters there is a laudation of Utkala, of the sanctu ary of Ekāmra and of the lake Bindusaras (mentioned in B. 41. 53-54). The date of the inscription is doubtful.

IV mention Haridvara and it cannot be said that they both are later than Alberuni (i. e. 1030 A. D.). Probably Gangadvāra was a more popular name in the 11th century than Haridvāra. Al. (vol.

seems to have been Kaśmira. The Mbh (vol. II. p. 119 ) on Pan. III. 2. 114 employs this form (abhijādasi Devadatta Kasmiran gamiyyamah ). Kašmira as the name of a country occurs in the Sindhvadigana. (Pan. IV. 3. 93). In NM the country is called Kasmira in many verses such as 5, 11, 43, 50, but sometimes Kasmira also. Later works also like H. C. 14.45 employ the form Kasmira; the Vik (18. 1 and 18 ) uses the form Kasmira. NM (292-93) derives the name from ka meaning water ( kam vāri Harina yasmād-desad-asmad-apākrtam | Kas mirākhyam tato hyasya nama loke bhavisyati). Ptolemy speaks of it as Kaspeiria and states that the country was situated below the sources of Bidaspes (Vitastā). Sandabal (Can drabhāga) and Adris (Iravati). Vide Ptolemy pp. 108-109 and NM 43. The Vanaparva speaks of the whole country of Kasmira as boly (130. 10). Ain. A. (vol. II p. 354 notes that the whole of Kašmira is regarded as holy ground. Vide also V 82. 90, S. 27. 17, Anu 25. 8.

by the head waters of the Vitastā and to the minor slopes of moun tains that surround it. Hiouen Thsang (Beal's B RW W vol. 1. p. 148) states that 'Kasmīra kingdom is about 7000 li (one li being equal to about 5 miles), that as the country is protected by a dragon it has always assumed superiority among neighbouring people, that they love learning and are well instructed and that (p. 149 ) the country was once a dragon lake and that afterwards it became dry'. The words of Hiouen Thsang refer to an ancient legend according to which Kashmir was originally a lake (called Satisaras) 6 yojanas long and 3 yojanas wide and later became Satidesa (NM 64-66). that Umā herself is the country of Kasmira (NM 31), that the divine Vitastā rising in the Himalayas is like the simanta (line parting the hair) of this holy land (NM 45). The legend runs that Visnu conferred a boon on Vasuki-nāga who prayed to Viṣnu when Garuda began to devour all nāgas that he should stay in the Satidesa along with the other nāgas, that no enemy would kill any nāga (NM 105-107) and that Nila was made king of nāgas in the Satidesa (NM 110). The residence of Nila is the famous fountain near the village of Verrāg in the Shababad pargana. A certain demon called Jalodbhava grew in the Sati lake and killed men (NM 111-123 and Vām. 81. 30-33). Nīla approached the sage Kasyapa the father of all Nāgas, at whose intercession Visnu asked Anantanāga to pierce the hills and make the lake dry and then killed the demon Jalodbhava (R. I. 25). Then Visnu asked the Nāgas to live in peace and harmony with men. Sati became the river Vitastā. Vide Kūrma II. 43. 4. Nāga in Kashmir means the tutelary 

d eity presiding over the several holy springs, pools and lakes in which Kasmira abounds. Both NM (1130 31) and R (I. 38 ) state that there is not a spot in Kasmira even as small as a grain of sesamum which is not a tirtha and has not a nāga as its presiding deity. In Ain. A (vol. II. p. 354 ) Abul Fazl notes that there were in his day 45 shrines of Mahadeva, 64 of Viṣnu, 3 of Brahma and 22 of Durgā and that in 700 places there were graven images of snakes which were worshipped and about which wonderful stories were told. R (1.72) and NM (313-314) say that the country of Kasmira is Parvati, that the king thereof should be deemed to be a part of Siva and that none who desires prosperity should disobey (or disre spect) the king. R (I. 42) summarises in one verse the peculiar features of Kašmira viz. 'learning, lofty dwellings, saffron, water containing ice and grapes; these are common here, although rare in 

the three worlds'. Kaśyapapada-(under Gaya) Vā. 109,

river starts from Brahmasaras, acc. to Salya 51. 19, from Badarikāśrama acc. to Vām. 2.42-43 and from Plaksa tree acc. to Vām. 32. 3-4, P. V. 18. 159-160 (say that Sarasvati was asked to cast the Vadava fire into the sea in the west). This is probably an allusion to volcanic action whereby Sarasvati disappeared. Vām. 3. 8 says that as Sankara guilty of 

Brahmabatyā plunged into it, it dis appeared, while elsewhere (e g. in V. 130. 3-4) it is said that it dis appeared through fear of the touch of sudras, Nisadas and Abhiras and Anu. (155, 25-27) states that Saras vati went to Marudesa owing to curse by Utathya and became dry and un holy. After disappearing it becomes visible at Camasodbheda, Sivodbheda and Nāgodbheda. The Sarasvati in Kuruksetra was called práci Sarasvati (P. V. 18. 181-182 ). See Dey pp. 180-181 for several Sarasvatis. V 130. 1-2 state that those who die on the Sarasvati go to heaven and this was the blessing conferred by Daksa when he per formed a sacrifice there. Vide Oldham's paper in JRAS for 1893 pp. 49-76; B-There is another holy river of the same name rising in the south-west end of Aravali hills and flowing south-west through the dis tricts of Palanpur, Mahikantha and Baroda and past the ancient cities of Anhilvād and Siddhapur and falling into the lesser Runn of Cutch.

this. It is possible that when the Sarasvati became dried and only a marshy bed was left it was called Saravati, but that in the times of the Amarakosa, Sarāvati is probably the river Saravati which falls into the sea near Honavar (North Kanara District) on which are the famous Gersappa falls. In the Raghuvamsa (XV.97) Sarāvati is said to have been 

the capital of Lava, son of Rāma. Sarayū-(1.) Rg. IV. 30. 18, V. 33. 9, 

X. 64. 9 (Sarasvati, Sarayu and Sindhu are mentioned together), In all these places the word is Sarayu, while in classical Sanskrit it is Sarayū or Sarayü (M. 22. 19, Va 45. 94, N II. 75. 71. Raghuvamsa 15.95 and 100). M. 121. 16-17 and Br. II. 18. 70 show that Sarayu springs from the Mānasa lake situ ated at the foot of the Vaidyutagiri. Ayodhyā was situated on the Sarayu (Ram. II. 49. 15). Sarayū rises from Himalaya (Va 45.94, M. 114. 21). According to Pan. VI. 4. 174 (Dandi nāyana-) the water of Sarayū was called Sarava (Kašika says 'Sarayvam bhavam sāravam udakam'). In the Cullavagga (SBE vol. XX p. 302) it is one of the five great rivers of India and in 'Questions of Milinda' (SBE vol. 35 p. 171 ) it is one of ten great rivers, but in both places it is written as Sarabhū. Vide T.P pp. 500, 501 where it is stated that it rises from the left toe of Visnu and is joined by Ghargara. It is the Sarabos of Ptolemy (p.99). It is also 

called the Ghogra or Gharghara. Sārdula-a Saivaksetra, according to

CONCLUDING REMARKS ON TĪRTHAS 

At the end of this long list of tirthas a few words, as promised on p. 722 above, must be said about the attitude that we Indians of the 20th century should adopt towards the moun tains, rivers and other holy places in Bhārata. Modern secular education and the prevailing economic conditions, stresses and trends leave hardly any room for moral and spiritual uplift. We are surrounded on all sides by anxiety, want, misery, hardness of heart and crime. Therefore, the endeavour of all those who have the good of our country at heart must be to cherish all such institutions as terd to lift the mind out of narrowness and to make it concentrate for some time at least on noble thoughts and aspirations and on detachment from the all-engrossing pursuit of money, Pilgrimage is one of such institutions. Those who have faith in pilgrimages as enabling a pilgrim to attain heaven, to collect merit and reach release from samsāra should give pilgrimages a new orientation, should see that their charity is not wasted on indolent, ignor ant and vicious priests, should improve the methods of worship at holy places in such a way as will satisfy all hygienic requirements. The priestly class at holy places should remem ber that in the coming generations they are likely to find their occupation gone, unless they improve themselves, unless they try to be less ignorant and indolent than they are at present and really serve as honest business agents or Travel lers' Guides. The number of people visiting holy places in the belief of accumulating merit is sure to become less and less, as modern secular education spreads. But it would be a calamity for the moral and spiritual greatness of India if pilgrimages to holy mountains and rivers came to be stopped altogether. I would very strongly recommend to all men, however highly educated, the undertaking of pilgrimages to certain hallowed spots. Our country has recently secured independence and it now rests entirely with us to make or mar the character of the teeming millions of this our land. All things that tend to create in Indians the deep feeling that amidst diversities of physical features, food, dress and habits, all of them are-one people, that there is no part or district of this vast land which cannot claim to have made some substantial contribution unity religious and philosophical thought, in abiding literature, in works of art and in holy places, that the destinies of the Indi aiutantal

Concluding remarks on tirthas 

827 

of one part of Bhārata are bound up with the destinies of all others. Frequent visits to distant places in Bhārata, mixing up among people of other parts and understanding their peculiar good points, needs and failings is absolutely necessary if we are to keep our freedom. India is thrice blest in the mountain ranges of the Himālaya,which contains the highest peaks in the world and is full of large and life-giving rivers and of numerous shrines associated with the names of the greatest sages and heroes of antiquity. Every Indian who is proud of the great religious and spiritual heritage of our country must make it a point to devote some part of his time to frequenting holy mountains, rivers and other places of pilgrimage. When we see even from a distance the purity, the whiteness and the serenity of the snow-capped peaks of the Himālaya, the play of delicate and exquisite hues and tints of blue, mauve, and pink when the sun begins to shine on them, a sense of wonder, joy and elevation comes upon us. The glorious view of a peak like Kinchinjunga, which is an unforgettable experience, lifts up the whole life of the onlooker to a higher plane for long. Similarly, the sight of the holy Ganges at night or at sunrise in Haridvāra or on the majestic Ghats in Banaras surely empties our minds of meanness and for the moment at least fills our hearts with a sense of nature's beauty and with purity, and brings us in tune with the Infi nite. I may state here that the talk of the conquest of Everest in which some members of European expeditions indulge jars on my ears. This great peak' has so far vanquished (physically) all those who attempted the conquest. But in a figurative sense Everest and other high peaks have been for ages conquer ing the hearts of men. Even the members of these expeditions will admit that Everest and its brethren have drawn men to themselves from all parts of the world, made them give up their usual uneventful and placid activities, have evoked in those who attempt the climbing of these giants unbelievable courage, endurance, resourcefulness and self-abnegation and have been instrumental in exhibiting to the world what un known powers the human spirit possesses. Therefore, these silent but awe-inspiring peaks should be looked upon as teachers of mankind and not as material things to be conquered and dealt with by human beings as they please.

Page 118 Note 267. On pp. 117–118 above reference has been made to the re-admission into the Hindu fold of those that had been converted to Christianity or Islam by force or fraud or even voluntarily. Not only was there re-admission of those that were converted, but non-Hindus, such as Yavanas, Kirātas, Sakas, were absorbed into the Hindu fold and were induced to adopt the practices of Hindus (such as śrāddhas and gifts to brāhmaṇas). Vide Sāntiparva chap. 65. 13-21 quoted above in note 830 (p. 364). A. Greek ambassador of king Antalikita (Antialkidas) named Heliodora, son of Diya (Dion), was accre dited to the court of king Bhāgabhadra, called himself Bhāga vata and raised a column in honour of Vasudeva in the 2nd century B. C. (JRAS 1909, pp. 1053 and 1087 and JBBRAS vol. 23 p. 104). Uṣavadāta, son of Dinika and son-in-law of Ksatrapa Nahapāna, is described in one of the Nasik inscrip tions (No. 14a in E. I. vol. VIII at p. 85) as a saka, but made very extensive donations to brāhmanas at Broach, Prabhāsa and other places. Part of one of his inscriptions is cited on p. 710 note 1618 above. Though the name Usavadāta (Rṣabha datta) is a Sanskritized one the two names Dinika and Naha pāna of the Kṣaharāta race appear to be non-Indian, Abhiras, Hüpas and Gurjaras became absorbed into the Hindu commu nity. People, after being made Moslems, returned to their ori ginal communities and gods. Moslem writers make this clear. Vide Elliot and Dowsons' History of India' vol. I. p. 126 ('the people of India had returned to idolatry, excepting those of Kasa') and Alberuni's India (tr. by Sachau) vol. II, pp. 162-163 where he refers to the return of Hindu slaves in Moslem coun tries to their country and religion. Prof. D. R. Bhandarkar in "Some aspects of Ancient Indian Culture' (1940) pp. 59-65 presents a very lucid and informing summary of the evidence on this point of the re-admission of those that were converted and of the absorption of non-Hindus. But it is not known what procedure was followed for this purpose. Therefore, a model rite for the return of a convert is set out here.
