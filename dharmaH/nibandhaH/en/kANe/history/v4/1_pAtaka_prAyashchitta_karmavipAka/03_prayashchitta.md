CHAPTER III PRĀYAŚCITTA; ITS ORIGIN, DERIVATION

AND MEANING

It is now necessary to turn to prāyaścittas as removers of sin. A number of subjects will fall to be treated here,

First, an attempt must be made to understand the etymo logy and meaning of the word 'prāyascitta' in ancient times. There are two forms of the word, prāyaścitti and prāyaścitta, which occur in Vedic works without distinction of meaning and both forms are fairly old, though prāyaścitti appears to be the older of the two. The form prāyascitti frequently occurs in the Tai, S. (as in II, 1.2,4, II. 1 4.1, III. 1,3,2-3, V. 1.9.3, V. 3.12.1) 136a. In some of these passages no question of sin arises. The word means 'doing some thing which would get rid of some accidental happening or mishap such as the breaking of an ukha (a pot or saucepan for boiling or cooking) or the sun's losing its brilliance,' In Tai. S. V. 3.12.1 the word is used in the sense of an expiation for a sin. So even in very old books the word had two shades of meaning. The Kausitaki137 Br. (vi, 12) states : ""they say 'whatever mistake or excess occurs in the sacrifice that affects the priest brahmā, that he treats with the three fold learning (i. e. the three Vedas)". The word also occurs in the Atharvaveda XIV. 1.30, Vāj. S. 39.12 (in close proximity to niskrti), in the Ait. Br. V. 27, in the Sat. Br. IV.5.7.1, VII. 1.4.9, XI. 5.3.8, XII. 4.1.6 and in other works also. The form prāyaścitta occurs in Kausitaki Br. V. 9, VI 12 and elsewhere. The Āśv. Śr. III. 10.38 and śānkhāyana Śr. III. 19.1 respectively employ the words prāyascitti and prāyaścitta138 In Pār. gr. I.

10 the form 'prāyaścitti' is employed. Jai. in several places * employs the word prāyaścitta (as in VI. 3.7, VI. 4.10, VI 5.45 and 49, XII. 3.16). Sabara 139 on the last sūtra (XII, 3.16) ex plains that the prāyaścittas (in the Sruti texts) are of two kinds, viz. some are meant to make good the defect in the procedure and materials of sacrifice which arises or befalls through some neglect or heedlessness, while others are subsidiary parts of a rite when an occasion arises i. e. they are undertaken to atone for not doing what is ordained or doing something which is forbidden (e. g. non-performance of daily Agnihotra even though the sun rises). The Sat. Br.140 XII. 4 and Ait. Br. 32.2-11 pro vide some interesting and amusing examples of the mishaps for which prāyascittas are provided e. g. when a vicious boar, ram or dog runs between the sacrifical fires, or if Agnihotra milk gets spilled while the cow is being milked or if the milk pot is turned upside down or if it were to break, or if the cow were to lie down while being milked, or if the fire were to go out after the first libation is offered etc. Vide also Mānava-gphya I. 3, Hir. gr. I.-5.1-16, Bhāradvāja gr. II. 32, Kausika-sūtra 46. 14-55, Aģv. Sr. III. 10 and Asv. gr. III. 6-7 for similar occurrences and prāyaścittas. The Mahābhāsya on Pāṇ. VI. 1.157 explains111 both prāyascitti and prāyaścitta on the analogy of the word Pāraskara. Prāyascittas may be said to be, in the language of the Mimāmsā, either kratvartha or puruṣārtha. The former are prescribed in the Srautasūtras. It is the latter kind of prāya scittas that are generally dealt with in Smrti works on prāya Ścitta. In this work the prāyaścittas mentioned in Srauta

Derivation of Prāyaścitta

59

works are passed over, as they have either been mentioned in vol. II. or were of rare occurrence even in olden days.

Most digests and commentaries derive the word prāyascitta relying: on a verse (attributed to Angiras142 by some) from prāya (meaning 'tapas') and citta (meaning resolve or firm belief), the idea being that prayascittas are so called because of their association with or emergence from a resolve to under go tapas or because of the firm belief that it will be a means of the removal of sin. Various other derivations are suggested by some writers. The Balambhatti143 on Yaj. TIL 206 quotes a half verse to the effect that 'prāya' means 'sin' and 'citta' means 'purification', which had been quoted by Paksadharamisra144, Bhaktūpādhyāya and the Todarānanda, but the Pr. M. (p. 2) says that the source or authenticity of that verse is doubtful. Hemādri refers to an unnamed bhāsyakāra's explanation viz. 'prāya' means 'destruction' and 'citta' imeans joining together' and prayascitta means the making good what is lost and that the word denotes a naimittika action on sin.

The Par. M. quotes a smrti text145 and says that that is prāyaścitta whereby the 'citta' (the mind) of a repentant sinner is made generally (prayasah) free (from emotion i, e. brought to a normal state) by the parṣad (assembly of learned brāhmaṇas).

Here 'prāyah seems to be taken as equal to 'prayasan' and 'citta' has its usual sense, In Sayapa's146 comment on the

Sāmavidhāna Br. T. 5.1 another derivation is suggested viz. that

prāyah' is composed of two parts 'pra' and 'ayah' and means “happening or finding' (of the non-performance of what is ordained) and citta' means 'knowledge'; and so religious obser vances after knowing a certain happening are called praya ścittas. The Pr. Vi. p. 3 and Pr. Tattva p. 467 quote Hārīta and give147 yet another derivation (from 'prayata' pure and 'cita' collected), in accordance with which 'prāyascitta' means such actions as tapas, gifts and sacrifices whereby a man becomes purified (prayata) and destroys his accumulated sins ('cita' being equal to ‘upacita'), just as clothes are made clean by the employ ment of salts, moist heat, putting in boiling water on a fire, and washing in water. Hence, as the Mit, says, the word prāya scitta conventionally148 denotes a certain act or rite of the naimittika type (since it takes place only when an occasion arises) intended for the destruction of sin (and therefore being desired for removal of sin it may also be called kāmya). The Par. M. quotes verses from Bphaspati's149 work of which the section on prāyascitta holds at the beginning and at the conclusion thereof that prāyaścitta is naimittika150 (to be performed when a cause

150, Actions are divided into three kinds, nitya, naimittika and kanya. Nitya acts are those like sandhya-vandana (which are obligatory and performed daily as a duty and which if not performed lead to sinful ness); naimittika are those acts which have to be done only on some occasion (as a bath on an eclipse) and kāmya rites are those which are performed out of a desire to secure some object (as the sacrifice called putreṣti for a som).

or occasion arises). Jābāla q. in the Pr. Prakāśa holds that prāyaścitta partakes of the nature of both naimittika and kāmya actions. The Pr. Prakasa finds fault with the definitions of prāyaścitta proposed by the Kalpataru, Sūlapāni and others and ultimately arrives at the conclusion that those alone are prāyascittas which are so spoken of by the learned, just as on Jaimini II, 1.32 (tac-codakesu mantrākhyā) Bhattācārya explains that mantras are those which the respectable yājnikas and those who studied the Vedas so designate1504

Sins as stated by Bphaspati151 and others are of two kinds, viz, intentionally committed and unintentionally committed.

Great divergence of views has prevailed from very ancient times as to whether prāyaścittas can destroy sins intentionally committed. Manu XI. 45 and Yaj. III. 226 are positive that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by prāyaścittas or by the study of the Veda. The difficulty arises about sins com mitted intentionally or with full knowledge. Gaut. (19. 3-6 * Vas. 22. 2-5) states two views, 1514 one holding that praya scitta should not be performed since deeds (here sinful deeds) are not destroyed (except by experiencing the consequences thereof), the other view holding that prayascitta should be per

(Continued from the last page) crimes in former lives men are born blind or idiots &c.) penances must always be performed for the sake of purification, because those whose sins have not been expiated are born with disgraceful marks.' Though Manu employs the word ' nityam' here, what is meant is that when a sin is com mitted, a prayascitta must necessarily be performed and it is not left to the volition of the sinner whether to perform it or not. Vide Mit. on Yaj. III. 220. But it does not follow from this that if prayascitta for removing a sin is not performed, another sin is thereby committed, for in that case there would be anavastha (regressus ad infinitum ).

formed (for the removal of the effects of sin). The latter relies upon certain indications in Vedic passages. Gaut. relies upon four such passages. The first says "152 'after performing the punaḥstoma 153 one can come back to (become fit for) soma sacri fice (i, e. for Vedic rites in general). Another indication is : "after performing Vrātyastoma (one becomes fit for Vedic sacri fices).' A third is: 'He, who offers the Aśvamedha sacrifice, crosses beyond all sin, beyond brāhmaṇa murder'. The fourth is: one should make a person charged with grave sins per form the Agnistut. Vasistha also (20. 1-2) gives expression to the two views about the efficacy of penances. 154 Manu XI. 45 (latter half) states, that according to some, prāya cittas may be prescribed for the removal of intentionally committed sins from indications contained in the Vedas. It cannot be said that these Sruti passages are mere arthavādas (i. e. laudatory texts). They must really be taken, though expressed in the form of ordinary arthavādas, as laying down (a vidhi) that one desirous of destroying his sins should perform Aśvamedha and the other sacrifices mentioned. In this case the maxim of rātrisattra 155 applies (vide Jai. IV. 3. 17–19). There are certain sattras (sacrifices extending over more than twelve days) called Trayo

The Vratyastoma is also an ekaha, which was prescribed for those whose upanayana was not performed at the proper time (and who had therefore become patita-sāvitrika). Yaj. I, 38 provides vratyastoma for patita savitrika. Vide H. of Dh. vol. II p. 377 and p. 385 (for its description from the Tāndya Brāhmaṇa). The Agnistut is an ekāha (vide Tai. Br. II. 7. 12 and Asv. Sr. IX. 7 22-25). Manu XI. 74 prescribes Aśvamedha, Gosava or Agnistut and several other sacrifices for the removal of the grave sin of brahmana murder.

Maxim of Rātrisattra

dasarātra, Caturdasarātra and so on. All these are called rātri sattras. With reference to these a Vedic passage says 'those who approach i. e. perform) these rātrisattras attain stability (long life or super-eminence)'. In the text prescribing the rātri sattras there is no mention of any special reward for perfor mance. Therefore stability' (pratiṣtha) contained in the passage must be held to be the reward of the performance of rātrisattras and not mere heaven (which is the reward of all sacrifices for which no special reward is mentioned, according to Jai. IV. 3. 15-16). The same maxim applies to passages like Yāj. III. 226 which say that sin is removed by penances 156. Medhātithi draws attention to the story in the Tai. S. VI. 2.7.5, Kathaka S. VIII, 5, Ait. Br. 35.2 that Indra consigned yatis to Sālāvskas (dogs or wolves) and had to perform the rites called Upahavya to get rid of the sin. Manu states his own opinion in the next verse (XI. 46) that sins committed unintentionally are destroyed by the recitation of Vedic texts and sins committed intentionally through folly are destroyed by various prāyascittas. Yāj. III. 226 (latter half) appears to hold that prāyaścittas do not destroy sins intentionally committed, but the sinner undergoing the prescribed penance becomes fit to be associated with other people on account of the texts (laying down the prāyaścittas); but Yaj. implies, it seems, that the results of sin intentionally committed (such as Hell and the like) are not got rid of. Manu XI. 189 prohibiting social in tercourse with sinners who have not performed penance practi cally conveys the same idea as that of Yāj. in III. 226 (latter half). Yāj. III, 220 observes that a man guilty of pātakas should perform prāyaścitta for his own purification (here and in the next world); in this way (i. e. if he performs penance) his inner soul recovers its composure and the people also become satisfied. This verse puts in a nutshell the purposes of prayascittas as conceived by the smộtis, viz. purging of sin (or purification), the satisfaction of the sinner's mind, admission to intercourse with

all people, Chagaleya157 holds that prayascittas free the sinner from the consequences of sins committed unintentionally, but no penance exists which frees a man from the consequences of sins knowingly committed except in the case of upapātakas and in suicides or attempts at suicide. The Par. M. (II. 1. pp. 200-201) cites a verse of Jābāli and verses of Davala setting forth the two views about the efficacy of prāyascittas, while it also cites the view of Baudhāyana-smrti that there is no prāyaścitta for sins committed knowingly and the view of Angiras that the penance is double in the latter casa'58, Angiras further says that prāyascittas do destroy the sin arising from committing acts that are forbidden and the like, just as the rising sun removes dark ness. Manu XI. 47 provides: 'A twice-born man having become liable to perform a ponance (for a sin), whether he committed it through fate or by some act committed in a former existence, must not have intercourse with virtuous men until he performs the proper penance.' Ap. Dh. S. (I.9.24.24-25) provides Ifa man slays a guru (father, Vedic teacher &c.) or a brāhmana who has studied the Veda and finished the ceremonies of a soma sacrifice he shall live according to these very rules (contained in Ap. Dh.S.I.9.24.10-32) until his last breath. He cannot be purified (of the sin of the murder of a guru or learned brāhmana) in this life. But his sin is removed (at his death)'.159 It appears to follow from Apastamba's words that penance ending in death destroys the sin. The same was the view of Angiras, Yama and others.

Twofold Consequences of sin

65

In this conflict among the authors of smrtis the solution proposed by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 226 has been accepted by most medieval writers and is as follows160. The potentialities and consequences of sins are twofold, viz those leading to Hell and the others preventing intercourse with members of the society to which the sinner belongs. Therefore, even though a prāya scitta may not be efficacious to prevent the first mentioned consequence (viz fall into Hell), there is nothing improper in prāyaścitta being effective in removing the obstacle to associa tion with other people. As to sinful acts that are not pataniya (do not cause loss of caste) prāyaścitta does destroy such sin fulness as expressly stated by Manu. XI. 46. Even as to sins that are pataniya and are committed intentionally, if a penance ending in death is undergone as laid down by Manu XI. 73, Yai. III. 247-248 and Gaut. 22.2-3 for brahmana murder; Manu XI. 90-91, Yāj. III, 253, Gaut. 23.1 for drinking surā; Gaut, 23.8 11, Manu XI. 103-104 and Yāj.

I.9.24.25and I. 10.28.18 quoted above. When Manu says (in XI. 89 latter half) that there is no penance for the sin of slaying a brāhmaṇa intentionally, the proper interpretation of this read along with Manu XI. 46 quoted above is not that there is total absence of prāyaścitta in such a case, but that ordinary prāya soittas (such as those in Manu XI. 72) would not do in such a Case, but only very heavy ones that would end in death. Medi eval digests like the Prayascitta-muktavali (folio 32a) hold that according to the Kalivarjya section penance ending in death is forbidden in the case of brāhmaṇa sinners and therefore a

brāhmaṇa murderer can only be made to undergo the twelve years' penance.

The Par. M. (II. part 1 pp. 201-203) sets out this view of the Mit, and appears to hold it itself. It sets out another view also. Those who hold this latter view read Yaj. III. 226 as 'kāmatosvyavahāryastu' with an avagraha. The meaning then is that one who has performed the penance prescribed for a sin does not fall into Hell, but he cannot be allowed to associate with good men (śistas ) if he is guilty of a wilful sin. There is a verse of Manu (XI. 190 = Vispu Dh. S. 54.32 ) that one should not associate with those who slay children, who return evi) for the good done to them, who slay those that come for protection and who kill women, even though they might have become purified by undergoing the appropriate penance. There is a similar verse of Yāj. III. 298 on which the comment of Vijñāneśvara is most interesting as indicative of the spirit of our medieval writers who were always oppressed by the might of words (Vedic or smrti) deemed as authoritative. The Mit. remarks:161 'the prohibition (contained in Yāj. III, 298) is based on the text alone (and not on logic or reasoning). What cannot a text do? There is nothing too heavy for a text. Therefore, even though a light penance is prescribed for slaying an adulterous woman, still there is a prohibition against associating with such slayers based on the words of the text'.

I. 58 says that a son born of a brāhma form of marriage renders 21 generations holy (10 paternal ancestors, ten descendants and himself) Visvarūpa says that this is all laudatory of the brāhma form and not to be taken seriously as it would be contrary to the doctrine of Karma; but then he turns round and says that it may be taken literally as stated by those who know Mimamsa 'स्तुतिमात्रमेतद्भूतानां भाविनां पावनानुपपत्तेः। उपपत्ता वा कृतनाशाकृताभ्यागमप्रसङ्गात् । यद्वास्तु फलविधिः । विवाहविशेषस्य फलविशेषापेक्षत्वात्। न चागमानुसारिण्यर्थेऽनुपपत्तिरिति शक्यं वक्तुम् । तथा च नैयायिकाः-न हि वचनस्यातिभारोऽस्तीत्याहुः। विश्वरूप गया.

IV1 The Power of Authoritative Texts This maxim is taken from the bhāsya of Sabara and is a favourite device with all Dharmaśāstra writers from Visvarūpa downwards to justify any statement of the smrtis however illogical or exaggerated it might appear to be. The Pr. T. (pp. 544-545) quotes 162 the Mit, about the two saletis of sin and its remarks on Yāj. III. 298 and does not approve of them, relying on the words of Bphaspati that no decision should be arrived at on the bare words of the sāstra, but it should also be supported by reasoning and that the words 'slayers of women' do not refer to adulterous women but to innocent women (such as the wives of one's enemies ). Nārada (sāhasa, verse 11) holds that those who are punished by the king with a fine of the first or second (madhyama) kind can be allowed to associate with other members of society but those who are awarded the highest fine should not be spoken to by others 162a. Those who take the view of the sinner's inability to associate with other men even after undergoing penance rely also upon Vedanta-sūtra III, 4. 43 (bahis-tūbhayathāpi smrterācārācca). The Par, M. very rightly points 163 out that the sutra refers to those who after going in for life-long celibacy abandon the duties of that stage of life (āśrama) and that it does not refer to householders and quotes a verse of

Kausika in support. The Smrti-muktaphala (Pr., pp. 867-868) refers to this discussion contained in the Par. M. The Pr. M. (p. 7) appears 104 to hold that the great Sankarācārya explained

Vedāntasutra III. 4. 43 after reading Yāj. III, 226 as 'kāmatos vyavahāryastu' and that those who fell from the vow of life-long celibacy (either as naisthika brahmacārins or as sannyāsins ) were to be excommunicated (and not to be associated with ). The printed editions of the bhāsya contain no express quotation of Yājñavalkya's verse, but from the fact of his quoting Atri's verse it is possible to hold that Sankarācārya understood Yajñavalkya as the Pr. M. says he did.

A question may naturally be asked: why should it be accepted that penances destroy sin (as stated in Yāj. III. 226). The answer is: what 165 actions are grave sins or minor sins or not sins at all is laid down by the śāstra (śruti and smrtis). For example, it is not clear to ordinary people why being an officer over mines or making friends of low people or being a servant of a sūdra should be a sin at all. But the smrtis say so. If the smrtis are to be relied upon for determining what acts are sinful, then it follows as a matter of course that the same smrtis which speak of penances as removers of sins must also be accepted and that no other means for determining the efficacy of penances can be appealed to. So also the Bhagavad gitā (IV. 37) states that the fire of spiritual knowledge consumes all (accumulated, sancita) actions (and their consequences).

Many of the sins (though not all) for which penances are provided in the smrtis are also offences punishable by the king or State. For example, murder, theft, incest, perjury are acts punishable by the State in almost all countries even now and were so in ancient and medieval India. Persons guilty of these were also liable to undergo prāyascittas. It is probably due to this double liability that punishments for crimes in ancient and medieval India were light as compared with the heavy punish ments for even trifling crimes inflicted in western countries only a century or two ago. But there are other acts which are not punishable by the State now and were not probably punished even in ancient or medieval India by the king. For example, forgetting Veda studied by a person, not tending Vedic fires consecrated by a person himself, sleeping till after sun-rise and sleeping at sunset are pātakas, acc. to Vas. I. 19 and some of those are upapātakas acc. to Yāj. III. 239. It does not seem

likely that an Indian king ever punished any person for these. On the other hand, obstructing the road, prying when the king is taking his meals, sitting before the king on one's haunches, speaking loudly before the king are among the fifty chalas of which the king could take cognisance suo motu and award suitable punishment (vide H. of Dh. vol. III. p. 266). But there is nothing to show that such actions ever fell within the purview of the rules about prāyascittas. The important questions are: What was the relation of the rules about prāyaścittas which were to be prescribed by a pariṣad (a meeting of learned brāhmanas) to punishments by the king as regards actions which were both pūtakas inviting penances and crimes entailing punishments by the King? Which of these two sets of rules was earlier? Were penance and punishment cumulative or alternative? It is difficult to give definite opinions on these questions. We know that prāyascittas like Aśvamedha are spoken of even in the Tai. S. We also know that the praśnavivāka (which is quite close to prādvivāka in derivation and meaning ) occurs in the Vāj. S. XXX. 10 and Tai. Br. III. 5. 6. Therefore it follows that judicial functions were very early separated from the executive functions of the king. The reference to the ordeal of fire in the Tandya Br. 14. 6. 6 (vide H. of Dh. vol. III p. 361) and the grasping of a red-hot hatchet in the hand by a person accused of theft and his being killed show that ordeals were administered and the punishment for theft was death. Brhaspati, quoted in the Vivādaratnākara, says 'When a man of good character and a diligent reader of the Veda has com mitted theft he shall be kept in prison for a long time and shall be caused to perform penance after having been compelled to restore the goods' (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 362 166).

The pariṣad made its own rules about prāyaścittas and the king awarded punishments. Which set of rules was earlier it is difficult to say. The king did not very probably interfere with the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the pariṣad and the brāhmaṇas helped the king in the administration of justice by being judges and by advising him as to the punishments to be imposed (vide

It is possible that this verse means that a learned brāhmana who has been well conducted but Dell a victim to the temptation of theft should not be jailed for a long time because jail life torments his mind and therefore he should be made mo restore stolen property and given penance,

Visnu Dh. S. V. 194). Gautama VIII,1, echoing the words of the Sat. Br. V. 4. 4. 5, observes: 167 'the king and the brāhmana with profound learning uphold the moral order in the world (or are upholders of the sacred law). The Āp. Dh, S. (II. 5. 10.12-16) contains very important information: The 'ācārya shall order those who, while participating according to the śāstras (in the privileges and responsibilities of their castes), have gone astray through the weakness of their senses to perform penances accord ing to the dictates (of the smộtis) commensurate with their (sinful) acts. If they transgress their ācārya's order he shall take them to the king. The king shall send them to his purohita proficient in dharmaśāstra and the science of government. He (purohita) shall order them to perform (proper penances) if they are brāhmaṇas. He shall reduce them by forcible means except corporal punishment and slavery.' So this passage shows that the king helped in carrying out prayas cittas. Nārada includes 'neglect of penances' among matters solely dependent on the king (prakirṇaka, verse 3) and not on complaints by private individuals. Devala 168 probably conveys the real position when he says: The king is the giver of krcchras (i. e. his consent is required for actually undergoing the prescribed penances), the learned man who has studied Dharmaśāstras prescribes the prāyaścitta, the sinner carries out the penance and the king's officer sees to the safe performance of the prescribed penance.' Parāsara VIII. 28 says 'an assembly should point out the proper penance after getting the permission of the king, it should not be done without reference to him, but slight penance may be done with out informing him'. The Par. M. II. part 1. p. 232 explains that this applies to prāyaścittas for sins like govadha or those that are greater than it. Devala 169 also has similar verses.

IV) Relation of the Pariṣad and the King Parāśara VIII, 29 states that the king also should not ignore the pariṣad and should not by himself prescribe penance. Paithinasi quoted by the Dandaviveka (p. 76) provides 170 for both prāya citta and punishment and from the tenor of the verse it appears that both were to be enforced by the king. The posi tion is tolerably clear as to medievel times. One feels great hesitation in stating definitely the relation of punishment to penances and the king's position as to both in ancient times. Ap. Dh. S. I. 9. 24. 1-4 provide 171 that one who kills a ksatriya or a vaisya or a sūdra shall respectively give one thousand cows, a hundred cows and ten cows for the purpose of removing the enmity and that in each of these cases one bull was to be given in addition for the purpose of expiation. Apastamba does not expressly state to whom the cows were to be given. The commentator Haradatta explains that they were to be given to brāhmanas. Manu XI, 127, 129, 130, and Yāj. III. 266-267 have similar provisions but in the chapter on penances. On the other hand, Baud. Dh, S. I. 10. 23. expressly states that the Cows are to be given to the king. As both the words 'vaira niryātanārtham' and 'prāyaścittarthah' are employed by Ap. it may be said that the cows were to be made over to the king even according to Apastamba. The cows were to be made over to the king for bestowal on the family of the murdered person to mollify them and if they refused to receive them the king was

ot to retain them for himself but was to distribute them among brāhmaṇas. We know that Manu (IX. 243-245) provides that the fine recovered from a man guilty of mortal sins was not to be taken for himself by the king but was to be offered to Varuna and thrown into water or was to be distributed among learned brāhmaṇas. Manu IX. 236 provides that for those who were guilty of the four grave sins ( brāhmaṇa murder &c.) and did not undergo penance for the same the king should inflict corporal punishment (branding on the forehead) toget her with fine in accordance with the śāstra. Manu IX. 237

( Matsya 227. 164) and Vispu V. 4-7 say that on the forehead a mark of female private parts with red-hot iron should be branded in the case of incest, the mark of a tavern flag in the case of drinking surā, the mark of dog's foot in the case of theft (of brāhmana's gold) and the mark of a headless trunk in the case of a brāhmaṇa-murder. Manu IX. 240 further prescri bes that men of all castes guilty of the four mahāpātakas com mitted unintentionally that perform the proper penance should not be branded on the forehead by the king but should be awarded the highest fine. Manu IX. 241 and 242 provide that a brāhmaṇa guilty of these grave sins unintentionally may be punished with the middle amercement (if he himself be possessed of good qualities) but if he was guilty of the grave sins committed intentionally he should be banished from the kingdom being allowed to take with him his wealth and paraphernalia; while persons other than brāhmanas when guilty of grave sins unintentionally committed were to be deprived of all their wealth and if guilty intentionally they were to be sentenced to death. These verses show that though prāyascitta be per formed persons guilty of grave sins were liable to undergo punishment and if no penance was performed then they were liable to branding and also fines etc. Manu XI. 56 provides that bearing false witness is similar to the drinking of surā and Manu XI. 57 and Yāj. III. 230 hold that misappropria tion of a deposit is like the theft of gold. Visnu Dh. S. (V. 169 ) provides that the misappropriator of a deposit was to be made to return the deposit or its price with interest and was to be punished like a thief by the king and V. 179 that a false witness had all his property confiscated. These instances establish that both fines by the king (i. e. rāja-danda) and penances prescribed by the assembly of learned men (i. e. parisaddanda or daiva danda) had to be undergone by those guilty of some grave sins that were also looked upon as crimes. In some cases the penance and the punishment were the same. For example, Gaut. 23. 10-11, Vas, 20. 13, Manu XI. 104, Yāj. III. 259 and several other smrtikāras prescribe for incest the penance of the excision of the testicles and penis and proceeding toward the south or south-west till the body falls. Nārada as quoted above prescribes for incest the punishment (danda) of the excision of the testicles. The Mit on Yaj. III. 233 quotas Nārada and remarks that the punishment of excision and deatk prescribed by Yāj. III. 233 applies only to non-brāhmaṇag ald that in such cases the punishment of death itself is the

prāyaścitta. There were works like the Madanapārijāta172 (p. 827) and the Mitākṣarā that held that the prohibition against corporal harm to brāhmaṇas (Manu VIII. 380) applies only to matters other than prayascittas and that since the Manusmrti itself (XI, 100) states that a brāhmana guilty of theft of brāhmana's gold may go to the king with an iron club and have his head smashed by the king, the death of a brāhmana as a penance for theft by being struck with a club presented by himself was not ruled out. In some cases punishment by the king was deemed to have purged a man of sin and no penance seems to have been thought necessary, as Manu VIII, 318 (=Vas. 19.45 ) says 'men that commit sins and are punished by the king become purified and reach heaven like good men who perform meritorious deeds.' The Mit on Yāj. III. 259 explains that this holds good only where the punishment is death, as in the case of incest noted above. Ap. Dh, S. II, 10.27. 15-16 provide 173 that a person guilty of slaying a man, of theft and of forcible seizure of land was to be deprived of his wealth by the king and was to be sentenced to death and that if the offender was a brāhmaṇa he was to have a piece of cloth tied over his eyes for the whole of his life (i. e, he was not to be sentenced to death). It appears that in very ancient times as provided by Āp. Dh, S. I. 9.25.4 the thief approached the king 174 with a club (of iron or khadira wood) on his shoulder and announced his guilt, when the king struck him with the club; on his being killed he became free from guilt. This was a penance as well as a legal punishment. Manu has a similar rule in his chapter on punishments (VIII, 314-316) providing that the thief should carry a weapon (called musala) or a club of khadira wood or a double-edged sakti or an iron staff and that if the king strikes him once with the club and he is killed

or if he is not killed but is allowed to go half dead and lives, the thief is freed from the guilt. The Mit, on Yāj. III. 257 quotes a prose passage from Sankha and a verse from Samvarta (122) to the same effect. Manu in the chapter on penances (XI. 100-101 = Agnipurāṇa 169. 20-21) provides the same procedure for theft as a penance. Vas. 20. 41, Yāj. III. 259, Visnu 52. 1-2 and Parasara XII, 69-70 provide a somewhat similar penance for the thief of brāhmana's gold. Vasistha introduces an important change viz., that the king hands over to the thief a weapon made of udumbara wood (or probably of copper) with which the thief is to kill himself. It appears that gradually the king gave up this unpleasant method of award ing punishment personally. Nārada 175 (parisista, verses 46-47) provides that after the thief comes running to the king and announces his guilt, the king was to touch him (with the club, as a symbolic gesture) and then let him off and the thief be came freed from sin by his confession of guilt. It has to be remembered, however, that the thief had to restore, even when he underwent penance, stolen property, as stated by Manu VIII, 40, Yāj. II, 36 and 270, Bșhaspati and by digests 176 like the Pr. Prakarana. If it were impossible to make the thief restore the stolen property the king had to make it good from his own treasury 197 (Gaut. X. 47, Sāntiparva 75. 10, Kautilya III, 16 ) or he had to make his officers 178 entrusted with the duty of preventing thefts pay the price of the stolen property (Ap. Dh. S. II. 10. 26. 8). Vide for further details H. of Dh. vol. III. pp. 166-168. It appears that the actual carrying out of the sentence of death was later on assigned to Candālas as stated by Manu X. 56 and Visnu Dh. S. 16. 11 (vadhya-ghātitvam cândālānām).

Circumstances to be considered

Another point to be noted is that as regards the awarding of punishments and prescribing of penances, the matters to be considered were the same viz. whether the lapse was inten tiona] 179 (kāmatah) or unintentional (akāmatah) or whether it was the first offence or whether it was repeated and what the circumstances as to the time, the place, the caste, the age, the capacity, learning, wealth were. Compare Kautilya IV. 10. Gaut. XII. 48, Manu VII. 16 and VIII, 126, Yaj.I. 368. Visnu v. 194, Vas. 19. 9 about punishments with Baud. 180 Dh. S. I. 1.16, Yāj. III, 293 ( = Atri verse 248 and Agnipurāṇa 173. 6), Angiras 143, Viśvāmitra, Vrddha-Harita IX, 297, and Vyāghra as regards penances. It is on account of this close connection between punishments and penances that the Prayascittatattva, after quoting Devala to the effect that if a man makes no move for taking prāyaścitta for one year, he has to undergo double penance thereafter and to pay a double fine to the king, re marks that the maxim is that prāyaścittas are to be moulded on the lines of punisbments 181. The Pr. M. (pp. 124-125) quotes Kāśyapa who provides a penance for one that causes mischief to a well, public park, bridge, rampart wall or a temple or idol, then quotes Visnu V. 169 which prescribes the highest fine for a breaker of idols, Manu IX. 285 which provides a fine of 500

panas for a breaker of idols and re-instatement of the idol by him and then remarks "dandavat prāyaścittāni bhavanti'. Nārada divided sāhasa into three kinds viz, prathama, madhyama and uttama, the last of which consisted in killing a person with poison or weapon, adultery and rape and injury to life. He then provides that when offenders guilty of the first two kinds were punished by the king, they became fit for association with the people, but that one guilty of the uttama-sāhasa, though punished by the king, was not fit even to be talked to (Nārada, sāhasa, verse 11).

The king had jurisdiction 182 to punish sinners if they did not agree to undergo the prāyaścitta prescribed by the parisad but it is extremely doubtful whether he exercised that jurisdic tion in all cases. Society or the caste also had a weapon in its hand viz. that of excommunication by ghatasphota if one guilty of a grave sin refused to perform the prāyascitta prescribed (i, e. it was jātidanda). Vide Gaut. 20.2-9, Manu XI. 182-185 and Yāj. III, 294 and H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 388 and vol. III. p. 1009 1010 for the rite of ghatasphota and re-admission to caste after ghatasphota. Many of the prāyaścittas prescribed for the grave sins were terrible (such as throwing oneself into fire, drinking boiling surā or water or cow's urine or milk or ghee for drinking sura, Manu XI. 73, 90-91, 103 &c.) and were to be self-inflicted and were not to be prescribed by the parisad as the words of Manu in XI. 73 'icchayātmanah' and 'prāsyed-ātmānam-agnau vā' clearly convey and as some of the digests expressly provide 183. In order to enable a man to be come fit for intercourse with his caste men he had to give a dinner to them or distribute sweetmeats even after undergoing prāyaścitta. So it follows that a man guilty of a crime was liable to three burdens, punishment by the king, penance prescribed by learned brāhmaṇas and giving dinner or sweetmeats to castemen.

Vast Literature on prāyaścittas

The literature on prāyaścittas is vast in extent, since in ancient times they loomed very large in the popular mind. Out of tho 28 chapters of the Gautamadharma-sūtra, ten (i. e. more than one-third of the whole) are devoted to penances. Out of the 30 chapters of the printed Vasiṣtha-dharmasutra, prāyascittas cover nine (20-28). Manu devotes verses 44 to 265 (in all 222) of chapter eleven to penances and the Yajñavalky asmrti con taining 1009 verses deals with prāyaścittas in 122 verses (III. 205-327). Several printed smrtis such as those of Angiras (168 verses), Atri (chapters 1-8), Devala ( 90 verses), Brhad-Yama (182 verses), Śatātapasmrti (in 274 verses) from the Anandaśrama collection of smrtis alone deal only with prāya scittas. Many other smrtis and several purāṇas, such as the Agni (chap. 168-174), Garuda 52, Kūrma (Uttarardha 30-34), Varāha 131-136, Brahmānda (Upasamhārapāda chap. 9), Viṣnudharm ottara (II. 73, III, 234-237) contain hundreds of verses on prayaścittas. Besides commentaries like the Mitaksarā, Apararka, Par, M. and others and digests like Madanapārijāta (pp. 691-994), there are special digests dealing with prāyaścittas alone such as Hemādri on Prayascitta (which is of doubtful authenticity), the Prayascittaprakarana of Bhavadeva, Praya scittaviveka, Prāyaścittatattva, Sniftimuktāphala (prayascitta section), Prayaścittasāra (part of Nrsimhaprasada), Praya scittamayūkha, Prāyaścittaprakāśa (ms. in the Anūp Sanskrit library, Bikaner, No. 2610), Prāyaścittendusekhara of Nāgojibhatta, which have been utilised in this work. The most elaborate treatment is found in Prāyascittaviveka, Par, M. II parts 1 and 2, and Prāyaścittaprakāśa.

The commentatore discuss the question about the persons who have adhikara (capacity) for having penances prescribed for them. Since Manu XI, 44 (prāyascittiyate narah) and Yāj. III. 219 (narah patanam-rcchati) both employ the word 'man' without 184 any qualification, the commentators and digests say that penances are meant for men of all varṇas, for all persons born of unions in the reverse order (pratilomajas) and for even candālas. Yāj. III. 262 states that a sūdra sinner

though he has no adhikāra (for recitation of Vedic mantras and homa), yet becomes purified by undergoing the observances (except japa and homa) for the periods prescribed. Angiras 185 provides that penance may be administered to a ģūdra devoid of japa and homa. Even as to japa and homa there were works like the Madanapārijāta p. 749 and Vy. M (p. 112) that relying on a verse of Parāśara VI. 63-64 held that a homa could be performed for women and sūdras in the ordinary fire through a brāhmana186. The Pr. V. relies on Manu X. 62 and a prose passage of Devala for the proposition that even Cāṇdālas have to perform penances, if they act contrary to the rules and pro hibitions laid down for them. Since the non-performance of what is prescribed and doing what is forbidden lead to si the person guilty of these or the person who has a desire to destroy his sins is a person entitled to perform prāyaścitta, as also one who repents of his guilt.

Before going into the subject of the several prāyascittas prescribed for each grave or minor sin, some questions of a general character have to be disposed of.

Some smrtis like Brhad-yama III. 1-2 and Sankha state that a boy over five years of age and less than eleven years old, if guilty of some pātakas such as drinking surā, has not to undergo penance personally, but his brother, father or other

P. 749. This is it VI. 63-64 (the printed edition in B. S. Series reads and a friare F ac:). It is rather inexplicable how while Nīlakantha in his Vyavahāramayūkha holds, relying on Parāśara, that the dattahoma may be performed by a sūdra or a woman through a brahmana. the Prayascittamayūkha of the same author propounds a different view in the words 'एतेन यन्महार्णवमदनरत्नयोः स्त्रीशूदादेविपद्वारा समन्त्रको जपहोमो भवत grâ creat' (p. 13 ). Did the author change his views or is the text of one of the two Mayūkhas tampered with by his successors? The pr. 673T (folio 30 b) explains Parāsara VI. 63-64 in a different way. It says that the verse does not lay down generally that a woman or any one else can in every case have a homa performed for her through a brahmana, but that where in a rite japa and homa are obligatory and the person concerned is unable to perform japa and homa in person there alone he can appoint a brābmana as pratinidhi. 37** w UETATEN 313771 farura यममात्रार्थत्वात् । प्रायश्चित्तागजपहोमयोस्तु निषेधादेवाप्रवृत्तेस्तत्र तस्यामवृत्तिः गतेजा। यन्महार्णवमदनरत्नयोः स्त्रीशूदादेविपद्वारा समन्त्रको जपहोमों भवत इति तत्परास्त

Prāyascittas and children

relative or friend has to undergo it for him and that if a child is less than five then whatever act it may do it is not deemed a crime, nor is it a sin and it is not liable to any legal penalty nor to any 187 prayascitta. The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 243) comments that these verses are not meant to prescribe a total absence of prayascitta in the case of children of five or less but are meant to convey that they are not liable for the full prāyaścitta prescribed for a sin. Its argument is that the texts lay down generally without any reference to the stage of life that a brāhmana should not be killed or that a person belonging to the three higher castes should not drink surā.188 Hence any one of whatever age who is guilty of having done such prohibited acts is liable and the words of Gaut. II. 1 and of Kumāra are to be interpreted as not excusing altogether the drinking of surā by a child but as referring to minor lapses. Bșhaspati expressly states that the dictum about a child being allowed to eat what it likes is confined to such matters as will not fall under grave sins.

It has already been stated above (n. 180) that the prāya scitta to be undergone depended upon many circumstances such as the time, the place, the age &c. And first as to age, several smrtig189 provide that a man 80 years old or a boy less than _187 ऊनैकादशवर्षस्य पञ्चवर्षात्परस्य च । प्रायश्चित्तं चरेद् भ्राता पिता चान्यः सुहृज्जनः॥ अतो बालतरस्यास्य नापराधो न पातकम् । राजदण्डो न तस्यास्ति प्रायश्चित्तं न विद्यते ॥ शङ्का, quoted by the मिता. on या.

16 years of age, women and diseased persons should be liable only to half the prāyascitta (prescribed for able-bodied men). The Mit, on Yāj. III. 243 quotes a verse of Sumantu that for a male below twelve and above eighty years of age the penance is half (of that for ordinary men) and one fourth for women within the same limits and a verse of Visnu that for women, old men and diseased persons half the penance should be prescribed and for boys ( before upanayana) only one-fourth. Some say that for boys less than five the penance is one-fourth. Cyavana ( prose) prescribes halí prāyascitta for boys, old men and women and declares that a person is a bāla up to 16 years and a man is to be regarded as similar to a bāla after 70. Katyāyana provided generally that the fines to be levied from females were to be half of those leviable from male offenders as regards all offences and when the punishment for a male would be death, a woman criminal was to be punished with the cutting of a limb (nose, éars &c. ) 190

The difference between a sin committed unintentionally (akāmatah) and the same sin committed with full knowledge (kāmatah) is this that for the latter the prayascitta is double of what is prescribed for the former as provided by Angiras, 191 Vyāsa and the Agnipurana. As Yaj. III. 226 employs the word ‘ajñāna' in the first half and the word 'kāmatah' as its opposite in the second half instead of the word 'jñānatah' it follows that Yāj. makes no difference between the consequences of jñāna (knowledge ) and kāmanā (desire).

The caste of the offender as well as of the victim made a difference in the prayascitta as well as in the legal punishment. Vide H. of Dh.vol. III. pp. 395-399 as to punishments for crimes dependent on caste. Visṇu 192 provides that the prāyaścitta for

Prāyaścitta depended on caste

a ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra sinner should be respectively, 1 and 4 of what is prescribed for a brāhmana sinner. The Agni purāṇa says 193 the same thing. The Par. M. II. 1. p. 231 quotes the Caturvimsatimata 194 to the same effect. The Mit on Yāj. III, 250 explains that the verse of Caturvimsatimata applies to all cases except where any one of the four sāhasas is committed by a man of a lower caste as against one of a higher caste, Brhad-Yama (IV. 13-14) in prescribing penance for the kill ing of a cow provides the same scale of 4, 3, 2, 1 for the four varnas. Angiras (verse 3) prescribes the penances of Krochra and Cāndrāyana for a brāhmana partaking of the food of an antyaja, half of these for a ksatriya or vaisya guilty of the same. Yaj. II. 206-207 provide that the punishments for defamation depend upon the higher or lower varna or caste of the offender as well as of the person defamed and that if a ksatriya or vaiśya defames a brāhmana the fines are respectively twice or thrice as high as the fine for a brāhmana defaming a brāhmana and conversely if a brāhmana defames a ksatriya 'or a vaisya the fine is reduced by half in each successive caste. The Mit. quoting Angiras says that the rules about punishments apply to prāyaścittas for slaying a person i. e. if a brahmana slays anybody and a certain penance is prescribed for him, then a ksatriya killing the person would have to perform double the penance prescribed for the brāhmana and a vaiśya offender three times as much.195 It may be pointed out here that though the smrtis provided for . different punishments according to the castes of the offender and of the person wronged and though some commentaries and digests went into all those details for the sake of presenting a

Since, as stated above (n. 181), prāyaścittas were to be moulded on the lines of legal penalties, it appears that the discriminatory treatment about prāyaścittas depending upon the varṇa of the sinner must also have gradually fallen into disuetude with the disappear ance of the more severe prāyaścittas and the substitution of cows and monetary equivalents in later digests. And some digests expressly state this to have been the case in relation to prāyaścittas. For example, the Pr. Prakarana, after quoting Gaut. 22. 14-16 about the prāyaścitta for killing a ksatriya or vaisya or sūdra under certain circumstances, remarks that in its day those prāyaścittas were no longer part of the practices of the people.196

Whether an act made a man liable to undergo prayas citta depended in some cases on the country also. For example, marrying a maternal uncle's daughter was and is allowed in certain countries and among certain castes in the Deccan and Southern India on the ground of custom, but such a practice was severely condemned by Manu XI, 171-172 and Baud. Dh, S.I.1. 17–24 and other smrtis. Bệhaspati refers to this custom as prevalent among southerners and states that in these countries persons following it are not liable to undergo prāyaścitta or penalty (at the hand of the king). Vide H. of Dh. vol. II. p. 462 for Bphaspati's verses.

Severity and extent of prāyaścitta depended also on the question whether a sinner had repeated the lapse or was a first offender. The Āp. Dh. S. (II. 10. 27. 11-13) prescribes that a brāhmaṇa who has once committed adultery with a married woman of equal class shall perform one-fourth of the penance prescribed for a sūdra having intercourse with a woman of the three upper castes, that for every repetition of the crime) one

fourth of the penance must be added and if (he commits adultery) for the fourth time, the whole penance (of 12 years must be performed 197). The Mit, on Yāj. III, 293 remarks that for a sin that is committed knowingly the prāyaścitta is double of what is prescribed for the same sin if committed unintention ally and that if a sin is committed intentionally and is repeated then for the repeated lapse prayascitta is four times as much as that for the same deed done unintentionally. Similarly, the āśrama to which the sinner belonged made a difference in the prāyaścitta as stated by Angiras 'when persons in other āśramas are guilty of sins for which penance is prescribed if committed by householders, then the prayascitta is increased in the same proportion that is laid down for śauca (bodily purity 198). Manu V.137, Vas. VI. 19, Visnu Dh. S. 60. 26, Sankha 16.23-24 pro vide that Vedic students, forest hermits and sannyāsins have respectively to perform twice, thrice and four times as much sauca as is prescribed for householders (e. g. by Manu V. 136

=Visnu 60.25).

One convenient and merciful rule laid down by the smrtis was that if a man died in the midst of the period for which penance had to be performed (sometimes it extended to twelve years or more) he became free from the sin here and in the next world as stated by Harita, Vyasa and Yama199.

Though the smrtis have entered into very great details about the prāyaścittas for different individual lapses, still they cannot be supposed to have dealt with every lapse. Therefore,

Gaut. (19. 18-20) provides that these acts (viz. Vedic recitation, tapas, fasting, gifts &c.) may be optionally performed, when no (particular penance) has been prescribed, that for grave sins difficult penances and for trivial faults easy ones may be pres cribed and that Krcchra, Atikrochra and Cāndrāyaṇa are pen ances for all sins.200-Manu XI. 209 (= Visnu 54,34) provides that for the expiation of offences for which no particular atonement has been prescribed, let (the parisad) prescribe a penance after considering the (offender's) strength and the nature of the offence. Parasara (XI.55-56) provides that the recitation of the Gayatri ten thousand times is the best penance for all sins and that Candrayana, Yavaka, Tulapurusa and serving cows destroy all sins. Yāj. III. 265 provides that a man is purified from all sins by undergoing the penance for cow-killing or by Cāndrāyana, observance for a month of the milk vrata or by Parāka. Manu XI. 117 provides for all upapātakas except the sin of sexual intercourse by one who is in the stage of Vedic student the penance prescribed for govadha or cândrāyana,

One guilty of a sin, even though he may himself be a learned man, should approach an assembly of learned brāhmanas and after making some present (a cow or the like ) announcing the nature of his lapse seek their decision about the proper penance for his lapse (Yaj.201 III. 300 and Parasara VIII. 2). The Mit., Par. M., Pr. S. and other digests quote long passages in verse from Angiras 202 who provides that the sinner should

Instead of विपेन्द्राः the विष्णुपुराण has मैत्रेय, This very verse is quoted as बृहस्पति's in प्राय, तत्व, p. 545 (with मैत्रेय for विप्रेन्द्राः ).

Approaching the pariṣad

not conceal his lapse and lose time; he should bathe with his garment on, and with the garment still wet approach the asserbly and should prostrate himself on the ground. Thus the elders of the assembly ask the man prostrating himself before them 'what is your business, what is the trouble and what do. you seek from us'. The assembly then asks him to go aside a little and debate among themselves what the penance should be, considering all the circumstances of time, place, nature of the lapse, age &c. Then one of them at the desire of the assembly should declare the assembly's decision as to the proper penance after citing the smrti passages and reducing the penance in view of the weakness and other circumstances of the offender. It has already been stated that the pariṣad acted under the direction of the king in matters of prāyaścitta and that the king was not to interfere with the decision of the assembly. The principal stages in a penance were four viz. approaching the pariṣad, the declaration of the appropriate penance by the pariṣad, the actual performance of the penance declared and the announcing of the sinner's freedom from taint (Angiras q. by Pr. Prakāśa folio 27a 'upasthānam vratādeśascaryā suddhi prakāśanam prāyascittam catuspādam vihitam dharmakartr bhiḥ#").

It is not necessary here to set out the details of the consti tution of the pariṣad, of the qualifications of the sistas who were to be the members of the pariṣad and their privileges and duties. These points have already been discussed at length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 966-974. A few matters not stated there are mentioned here. Caste exclusiveness and pride had gone so far that Parāśara (VIII, 25) and the Caturvimśatimata quoted by Par. M. state that a dvija though he may be of bad character is to be honoured and not a sūdra who may have controlled his senses, that the advice of a sūdra even though learned and devoted to the knowledge of the śāstras should not be accepted like sacrificial food when licked by a dog 203.

gular abbreviation) is employed in several smrti passages 203a, Parāśara (VI. 55-57) provides that the assembly should take compassion on the weak, on boys and old men and should reduce the penance, but not otherwise and that if learned men through affection, greed, fear or ignorance reduce the penance that should be prescribed they themselves incur the sin. 2036 Devala says the same and adds 204 that the reduction in the penance should not be directed by one man alone or by a person ignorant. of Dharmasastra and that it is only a number of brāhmanas who are proficient in Dharmaśāstra that are entitled to reduce the penance through compassion for the sinner. The decision of the assembly should be unanimous 205 as far as possible.

If the learned brāhmaṇas of the assembly knowing the proper prāyaścitta do not declare it in the case of those who are distressed by their own sin and seek direction, they incur sin similar to that of the seeker after proper penance 206
