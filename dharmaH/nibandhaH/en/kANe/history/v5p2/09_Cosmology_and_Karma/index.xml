      <description>&lt;p&gt;SECTION IX&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXXIV&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;COSMOLOGY&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All writers on Dharmaśāstra are agreed on the existence of God. They rarely enter upon the task of adducing arguments for the existence of God. Christian theologians for hundreds of years put forward various arguments pointing to the existence of God. They are briefly summarised in William James &amp;lsquo;Varieties of religious experience&amp;rsquo; p. 437 (ed. of 1920). The cosmological argument reasons from the ordered univers to a First Cause which must be conceived as God who must at least possess whatever perfection the universe itself contains. The argument from purpose or design (teleological argument) based itself on the evidence of purpose or design in Nature and concludes that the First Cause (God) must be a creative intellect or mind. Then there are other arguments also such as the &amp;lsquo;moral argument&amp;rsquo;(viz. the moral law presupposes a law-giver), the argument &lt;em&gt;ex consensu gentium&lt;/em&gt; (vir, there is widespread belief in God all over the world and it should carry weight).&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXXV The doctrine of Karma and Punarjanma&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(transmigration or metempsychosis )&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most fundamental doctrines of the Indian system of religion and philosophy, is an endeavour to answer the question that occurs to all thoughtful persona, viz. what happens to man after the death of the body and has influenced for thousands of years or at least from the times of the Upaniṣads all Indian thought and all Hindus, Jains and Buddhists. This is a vast subject and bas during the last few decades attracted the minds of numerours writers in the West. There is now a voluminous literature in the West on reincarnation, 2487a Several countries in historical times believed in transmigration. Herodotus 34876 states that some of the Greeks (whose names he know but did not disclose ) had used that doctrine as their own, but that the Egyptians were the first to teach that the human soul was immortal and that at the time of the death of the body it entered into some other living thing then coming to birth. Pythagoras appears to have believed in it and there are controversies whether he derived it from India. Prof. A. B. Keith (in J. R. A. S. for 1909 pp. 569 606) after a lengthy discussion holds that Pythagoras did not borrow it from India. The present writer does not express any opinion on that subject as it is irrelevant for the purpose of this volume. Hopkins and Macdonnell accept the theory of Indian Influence on Pythagoras, but Oldenberg and Keith do not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
