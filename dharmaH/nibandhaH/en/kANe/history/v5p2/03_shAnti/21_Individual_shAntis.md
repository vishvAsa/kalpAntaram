CHAPTER XXI 

Individual śāntis 

It is now time to turn to individual śāntis, mostly post-vedic. The first is Vināyaka-śānti or Ganapatipūjā. This is perfornied at the commencement of all samskāras such as u punajanı and marriage in order that the fruit thereof may be had without obsta cles or for averting the evil effects of portents or in order to mitigato the adverse effects of the death of a sapinda or the like. When it is performed for its own sake it should be performed on the 4th tithi of the bright halt, on Thursday ild the auspicious nakṣatras Pusya, Śravaṇa, Uttarī, Rohini, Lasti, Aśvinī, Mrga 

· śīrṣa, but when performed at the commencument of Upanayana or the like, one may perfurm it at time suited to the time of the principal rite. The sunluluu is given below. 11% In H. of Dh. vol. II pp. 213-216 it has been shown bow in the earliest stages represented by the Mānava-gruya and Baijavāpa-gshya which speak of four Vināyakas, all woru evil spirits, how in the next stage' represented by the Yājñavalkyasmrti (1. 271–294). Vinayaka is not only represented as causing obstacles ( Vighna krt) but also as bringing success in all actions and rites (Vighnahrt) and how later on it was prescribed that Gapapati pūjā must be done first in all rites (Gobhila I, 13). Yāj. I. 293 provides 1197 that by worshipping Vināyaka in the way pres cribed and also the planets, a person socures success in his undertakings and the highest prosperity. The Viṣṇudharmottara II. 105. 2-24 borrows the verses of Yuj. l. 71-292, though not in the same order and adds a fuw. 'l ho Brahmapda provides 1198

that Gajānana must be worshipped for success in all desires, in all samskūras such as Garbhādhāna and Jātakarma, when start ing on a journey or engaging in a commercial undertaking, at the time of battle, in the worship of gods, in troublous times. The Bhavisyottara chap. 144 has a śānti called Gananāthaśānti which resembles the Vināyakaśānti of Yāj. 

In the Yājñavalkya-smrti (I. 294-308), the Vaikhānasa smārta-sūtra (IV. 13-14), the Baudhāyana-gļhyaśoṣasūtra, the Matsya-purāpa (93. 1-105), the Viṣṇudharmottara I. 93–105 and other purāṇas, in the Bșhad-Yogayātrā (chap. 18. 1-24), and in the medioval digests provision is made for a śānti rite to the nine grahus, viz. the Sun, the Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn (mentioned in the order of the week-days), Rāhu and Ketu. This naruyrahasūnti is the model (prakļli) of all śānti homas in all medieval digests. The Vaikhānasa-smārtasūtra 1199 provides that all religious rites should be preceded by this naya graha-śānti. Yājižavalkya 1200 says one desirous of prosperity, of removing evil or calamities, of rainfall( for crops), long life, bodily health and one desirous of performing magic rites against enemies and others should perform a sacrifice to planets.'t The Matsya (93.5-8) states that the narugrahamukla is of three kinds, viz Ayutahoma (in which 10000 oblations are made ), Lakṣahoma and Kotihoma. The first is described at length in Matsya 93.; 7-84, Laksahoma in 93. 85-118, Kotihoma in 93. 119-139. The Matsya further provides 1201 that Ayutaloma should be per formed in marriages, festivals, sacrifices, establishment of images and other rites, in order that no obstacles should arise therein and on occasions when the mind is perturbed or when some evil omen or unusual event happens.

The notes will slow that several verses arc common to both Yāj: and Matsya and the latter is far more elaborate than 7p. or . I. . It is probable that Yāj. is the carliest of the three, that a. F. X. comes next and Haty is the latest of the three.

The procedure in Yāj. being concise and probably tho earliest among the extant works on grahayajṅu is set out hore, with a few additions from Matsya and Vaikhānasa. The images of the nine planets should respectively be made of copper, crystal, red sandalwood, gold ( for both Mercury and Jupiter), silver, iron, lead, bronze or (if all these be not avail able) they should be drawn on a piece of cloth with powders having colours appropriate to each planet or should be drawn on circles with fragrant substances (such as sandalwood paste ). The Matsya 1202 (93. 11-12) prescribes that in drawing the images the Sun should be in the middle, that Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, Moon, Saturn, Rāhu and Ketu should be established with grains of rice respectively in the south, north, north-east, east, south-east, west, south-west and north-west. Yāj. (I. 298) proceeds garments, flowers and fragrant substances

of the colour 2203 appropriate to each should be offered to the planets, also offerings should be made, guggulu is to be the incense for all planets and oblations of boiled rice accompanied with the mantras ( specified below) should be offered respectively to the nine planets. 

The Vispudharmottara (I. 102,7-10) gives the game mantras as Yāj. does, Bhaviṣya (IV. 141. 34-36) gives the same except for Rāhu, for which it gives 'Kayā naścitra,' as in Matsya. Padma (V. 82. 30–32) is same as Matsya. Yāj. then proceeds (I. 301-302) that in homa for each of the planets the fuel sticks (samidh )1204 were to be 108 or 28 anointed with honey or clarified butter or with curds or with milk and they were respec tively to be of the arka plant, palāśa, khadira, apāmārga, pippala, audumbara, śami, dūrvā and kuśas for the sun, the moon and so on in order. A man 1205 of the three varṇas should honour brāhmaṇas according to the prescribed procedure (wash ing their feet &c.) and should feed them respectively (Yāj. I. 304) with boiled rice mixed with jaggery, or cooked in milk and sugar, sacrificial food (havisya), boiled rice from paddy becoming ripe in 60 days from sowing mixed with milk, boiled rice with curde, boiled rice with ghee, boiled rice with pounded sesame, rice mixed with meat, rice of various colours, for the sun, the moon and so on in order or with food that is available and according to his ability. The dukṣiṇā (fee) to the brāhmaṇas should be a milch cow, conch, draught bull, gold, garment (vāsas), a horse (white ), dark cow, iron weapon, a lamb, in honour

The Hity slightly differs on both these; chap. 93, 16-17 provide that the colours are; red for the Sun and Mars, white for the Moon and Venus, yellowish for Mercury and Jupiter, dark for Saturn and Rāhu and smoky for Ketu. The presiding deities of nine planets according to Matsya (93. 13-14) are Śiva, Umā, Skanda, Hari, Brahma, Indra, Yama, Kāla and Citragupta for the planets, Sup, Moon and so on respectively. ___1204. कर्तव्या मन्त्रवन्तश्च चरवः प्रतिदैवतम्। अर्कः पलाशः खदिरस्त्वपामार्गोऽथ पिप्पलः । औदुम्बरः शमी दूर्वा कुशाश्च समिधः क्रमात् ॥ एकैकस्य त्वष्टशतमष्टाविंशतिरेव था। Evet Auhigi TeaTaTTor at yat: 11 7191.

respectively of the sun, moon and so on. The Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 103. 1-6 ) contains the same fees. 1206 He should offer special worship to that planot that may be unfavourably situated ( as regards his nakṣatra or horoscope) at a particular time. Yāj. winds up by saying that the rise and fall of kings depend on planets (vide note 800 for this verse). Viṣṇudharmottara (I. 106. 9–10) also has the same verse. Kr̥tyakalpataru (on śāntika, folio 5 b) quotes Bhaviṣya to the effect that planets are always favourable to him who abstains from injury to others, who is self-restrained, who acquires wealth by righteous means, and who always observes the niļamas (restrictive rules of conduct as in Yāj. III. 313). The śāntimayūkha (p. 21) also quotes this verso. 

The Vaikbānasasmārtasūtra (IV. 13) provides slightly different kinds of nairedya food for the nino planots (as in note 1205) and prescribes separate Vedic mantras for tho prosiding deities (of the planets) to whom oblations of ghee were to be offered. The Matsya remarks at the end of tho description of Ayutahoma: 'just as armour is a protection against the wounds by arrows, so śānti (graha-yajña) is protection against the strokes of Fate.'1207 

The Matsya (93.92) declares 1208 that Laksahoma is ten times of the Ayutahoma and Koṭihoma is one hundred times of Laksa homa in the matter of oblations, fees and rewards, that the pro cedure of invoking and bidding goodbye to the planets and presid ing deities, the mantras for homa, bath and gifts are the same in Lakṣahoma and Kotihoma. The Matsya gives 1209 the warning

that & sacrifice devoid of distribution of food burns (i. e. brings disasters on) the country, devoid of (proper) mantras burns the officiating priests, devoid of (proper) fees burns the sacrificer; there is no enemy as (disastrous as) a sacrifice and that a poor man should not start on a Laksahoma, since wrangling (about food or fees) in a sacrifice always causes trouble or misfortune (to the sacrificer). The Bṛhadyogayātrā of Varāha (chap. 18 verses 1-24) deals with grahayajsız and closely follows Yāj. though some details are added here and there. Verses about the sun are quoted below (n 1213). The Yogayātrā also (chap.6) deals with the same matter. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 164) is a wholesale copy of Yāj. (I. 295–308). The Matsya (in chapter 239. again deals with Koṭi-homa which continues for a yoar. The Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 94) contains nine verses on the manner in which the figures of the nine planets were to be drawn or painted and these are quoted by the Mitāksarā on Yāj. I. 297-298 and by Kr̥tyakalpataru (on śānti) folio 5a. Vide Kotihoma in list of vratas (p. 290 ). 

The Grahayajña in Yāj. is short and simple, but in some purāpas such as the Bhavisyottara (141.6-85) and medieval and modern works it has become an elaborate affair by the addition of numerous details. One or two details may be pointed out. Each planet was supposed to have a gotra and was 1910 deemed to have been born in a certain country (vide note 875 p. 588 for the countries of the birth of planets). Therefore, in invoking the presence of each planet these two details have to be added ( as specified below in the note for the sun by way of illustra tion). The gotras of the grahas from the Sun to Ketu are respectively Kāśyapa, Atreya, Bhāradvāja, Atreya, Āngirasa, Bhārgava, Kāśyapa, Paithinasa, Jaimini. The Sainskāra-tattya of Raghunandana (p. 946 ) sets out from Skanda the gotras and countries of birth of the nine grabas and provides that if worship is offered to them without mentioning the gotras and countries that would be disrespectful to them. The Grahayajña

may be simple (kerala) as in Yāj. or Ayutahoma or Lakṣahoma or Kotihoma. A few further remarks are added here from the Agnipuarāṇa (chap. 149 ), Narasimha-purīna (chap. 35), Matsya (chap. 93 and 239 ), Bhavisyottara (chap. 141 and 142), Atharva parisista XXXI (for Kotihoma) and other works. The Kr̥tyakalpataru 1211 (Rajdharma) quotes the Brahma-purāṇa as follows: The king should perform two Laksahomas every year and one Koṭihoma which confers freedom from the fear of all calamities and he should at once perform a Mahāśānti that removes all evil consequences when there are eclipses of the Sun and the Moon and an earthquake. The Agni ( 149.12) says 'Ayutahoma confors slight success, Laksahoma drives away all distress, while Kotihonia tends to destroy all kinds of trouble and confers all desirad objects. The Viṣṇudharmottara (II. 36. 3-4 ) states that Asyapati, father of the fanious polirratū Savitri performed a Laksahoma with the Savitri (Ctiyatri) mantras for securing a son. There is no atpūln in the world that is not conjured away by Lakṣahoma; there is no more auspicious thing that surpasses Lakṣahoma. In the case of the king who gets a Kotihoma performed by brāhinanas the enemies cannot stand up against him in battle: excessive rainfall, drought, mice, locusts, parrots, evil spirits and the like and all enemies on the battle-field ara conjured away from him. '1212 The Bhavi. syottara (142. 11-12) calls koṭihoma a sānti rite, which yields all desired objects, by which even grave sins like brahmana-murder are removed at once, all utpātas are conjured away and great happiness. follows. Bharisyottara (chap. 142. 7-54 ) contains an elaborate procedure of Koṭihoma and also a briefer one (in chap. 142. 56-80). Atharva-parisista (No. 31) describes the procedure of Koṭihoma; it was to be begun on an auspicious tithi in the bright half, on the mulūrla called Vijaya and on 'one of the nakṣatras viz. Rohiṇī, Pusya, Anuradhā, the three Uttarās, Abhijit, Mrgasiras, Śravaṇa, Citri, Revati. The firepit was to be of eight cubits (for Laksahoma half of this ), the brāhmaṇas may be 20, 100, 1000 or even one crore, who

should offer fuel sticks anointed with ghee. The Brhadyoga yātrā 1213 verses are quoted below. 

Some of the medieval works like the śāntimayūkha (p. 12) quote verses from the Skandapurāṇa that state how the unfavo urable aspect of Saturn led Saudāsa to eat human flesh, that of Rāhu made Nala wander over the earth, that of Mars led to Rāma's banishment to forest, that of the Moon led to the death of Hiranyakasipu, that of the Sun brought about the fall of Rāvana, that of Jupiter led to the death of Duryodhana, that of Mercury made the Pandavas do work not fit for them, that of Venus led to the death of Hiraṇyāksa in battle. 

Some of the medieval digests (ribandhus) such as the Dharmasindhu lay down that certain special gifts should be made when any one of the planets is unfavourable to a person, They are set out here from the Dharmasindhu (p. 135). For the Sun-Ruby, wheat, cow, red garment, jaggery, gold, copper, red sandalwood, lotuses; for the Moon-rice grains in veggel made from bamboo, camphor, pearl, white garment, jar full of ghee, a bull; for Mars-coral, wheat, masūra pulse, red bull, jaggery, gold, red garment, copper; for Mercury-blue garment, gold, bronze vessel, mulya pulse, emerald, slave girl, ivory, flowers; for Jupiter-topan, turmeric, sugar, horse, yellow corn and yellow garment, salt, gold; for Venus-garmont of various colours, white horse, cow, diamond, gold, silver, unguents, rice grains; for Saturn-sapphire, māsa beans, sesame and sesame oil, kulitthe (pulse ), she-buffalo, iron, dark cow; for Rāhu gomeda (a kind of gem of four varieties), horse, blue garment, blanket, sesame and sesame oil, iron; for Ketu-cat's eye gem, sesarne and sesame oil, blanket, musk, lamb, garnients. In the author's youth these directions about dānas (gifts ) were followed by many people and even now they are being followed to some extent. The Madanaratna (on Sāntika-paustika, folios 5 a to 7 a) gives separate śānti procedure for each of the grahas from the Sun to Ketu from the Bhavisyottara.

History of Dharmaśāstra (sec. III, Ch. XXI 

Anothor śīnti rolers to the placating of Saturn when that planet occupios the 12th, 1st and 2nd rūśis from the rāśi of a man's birth. This is rougbly a period of seven years and a half and is called 'sūrilha-apilar șiku-piya' in Sanskrit and'sīble sāli' in Marāṭhi. The śānti consists in worshipping an image of Saturn made of iron placed in a vessel of iron or clay, covered with two dark garments or a blanket and offering to it dark and fragrant flowers, food or rice mixed with sesame. That food and tho image are to be donated to a dark brāhmana or to some brāhmaṇa with the mantra 'san no devir (Rg. X. 9. *). If the worshipper be a sūdra be is to repeat it paurānika 1211 mantra (notod below) which refers to Nala getting back his kingdom by placating Saturn. This should be done every Saturday for a year or one should every day repeat the mantra containing ten names of Saturn (in note 1214) and should also repeat a Sanistotra (eulogy of Saturn) every morning. By doing so the trouble that Saturn causes for seven and half years is arerted. 

Some of the medieval digests try to furnish an accurato definition of Sānti. Only one inay be cited here. The Santi mayukha 1215 of Nilakantha (first half of 17th century A. D.) defines it as a rito prescribed by the sastra, which (rite ) has its motive or urge sinfulness that is not clear (i.e. that is only inferred or presumed), that removes evil etfects relating only to this world, and the performance of which does not lead on to sin 

The first clauses excludes gifts made to remove diseases like tuberculosis; 1216 the 2nd clause distinguishes śāntis from sacri.

Definition of śānti

fices (intended to socuro other worldly rowards) and prūyuscittas (that yield consoquences in this world as well as in the next) and the last clause distinguishes śāntis from rites of black magic (for destroying one's nemies or securing a married woman's love &c.) which is sinful. 

The number of śāntis is legion. They are prescribed for conjuring away the effects of rare natural phenomena such as eclipsos, earth-quakes, rainfall (of peculiar kinds, of blood &c. ) hurricanes, fall of meteors, comets, halos, Fata Morgana; for protection against the evil effects of the positions and movements of planets and stars for the world and for individuals; for strange births among human beings and animals; for the good of horses and elephants; for certain untoward happenings about Indra's banner and about images of gods falling of weeping, the cries of birds and boasts, the fall of lizards and the like on a person's limbs and on certain stated periods or on solemn occasions. 

All rites of Sānti, Paustika rites and the Mahādānas were to be performed in ordinary fire, since there is no authority to prove that they are to be performed in srauta fires or in smārta fire. Manu 3. 67 and Yāj. I. 97 refer only to ceremonies laid down in the Grhyasūtras. On Yāj. I, 285-86 the Mitaksarā prescribes ordinary fire for offerings in Vinayaka-śānti. Vide also Santi. mayūkha p. 4. 

Both Manu !213 and the Viṣṇudharmasūtra prescribe that homas in which the Sun is the deity worshipped and Sāntihomas should be perforined by i householder on the partans (i. e. on Paurpamāsi and Amīvāsyā). These were śāntis at fixed periods. Similarly, when a person, male or female, of any casto completed sixty years, there was the possibility that he may die soon, or that he may lose his mother or father or his wife or sons or that various diseases may affect him; for removing this danger a śānti is prescribed (and is often performed even now) in order that he may enjoy a long life, be free from all calamities and for his complete prosperity. This is called Ṣaṣtyabdapūrti (completion of sixty years) or Ugrarathaśānti.12174

History of Dharmaśāstra (Soc. III, Ch. XXI 

One of the oldest available descriptions of tho Ugraratha śānti is found in the Baudhāyanagrhyasosa-sūtra (V. 8.). It is brief and the main items in it are set out here. It should be performed in the month of one's birth and on the nakṣatra of birth. A l'elli as large as a bull's hide slould be made, & jar full of water should be placed thereon and on the jar an image of Mityu (Death) manufactured with two niskis (i. e. gold probably weighing as much) should be placed in the south-east corner; worship should be offered to tho image and a jup of euch of the niantras 'apaitu mṛtyuḥ' ('may Death go away', Tai. Br. lII, 7. 14. 4), 'param Mrtyo' (O Death! follow tho path beyond &c.', Tai. Br. II, 7. 14. 5 and Rg. X. 18. 1), 'mi nas-toko' (O Rudra! do not injure our progany' &c., Tai. S. VII. 1. 11. 2 and Rg. I, 114.8), and. Tryanıbakam' ('we offer sacrifice to Rudra', Tai. S. I. 8.6.2 and Rg. VII. 59. 12) be made 108 tirnes; he offers oblations of cooked food with the fillilllllllūlyū (invitatory prayer) 'mī no mahāntam'( Rudra! du not destroy our grown up ones &c.', Tai. S. IV.5. 10., and Rg. I. 114.7) and the lījyū (offering prayer) “Mā nas-toke' (Tai. S. III, 4. 11.? and Rg. I 114, 8). Then he makes subsidiary offerings of ghee with each verse of the Gortasūkta. 1218 Then be sprinkles himself with water from the jar to the accompaniinent of mantras from the Mrtyusūkta, from the Āyusyasūkta and with Paurānika mantras, honours the officiating priest, gives dakśiṇā to the brāhmanas and & dinner. 

There is a Ms. (of only three folios in D. C. No. 609 of the year 1882–83, now in the Bhandarkar Oriental Institute at Poona) which deals with this sānti attributed to Saunaka and is called Ugrarathaśānti at the end. The sānti is to be performed on the day or nakṣatra of one's birth. On that day the person of 60 years should take an auspicious bath, perform his daily religious duties, should invite brāhmaṇas and choose one to officiate who is learned in the Vedas and Vedāngas and is well conducted. First Ganesa worship should be performed, then 

 - 1218 It is difficult to say what hymn is intended here by the word 'gbrtasūkteoa'. It is probably Rg. VI. 70. 1-6 (ghstavati bhuvanisim &c.). The Mștyusūkta is probably the same as Rg. X. 18. The Āyusya hyma is a Khila hymo after Rg. X, 128 and begina 'āyusyam varcasyam rāyasposam agdbbidam,' The Karmapradipa of Gobbila (1, 17) prescribes that Āyusya hymos should be recited in sraddha for śānti, The Smṛticandrikā (sāddba p. 503 ) quotes Gobbila I. 17 and explains that they are bymas like the one beginning 'ā no bhadrah' Rg. I. 89, 1.

He should bring together sarvausalhis, 1219 twigs and leaves of five trees, five jewels, purīcgav!ja, and pañcāmṛta; then worship of nine planets should be performed; an image of Mārkandeya was to be made from one pala or pala or 1 pala and the image was placed in a jar full of water surrounded by two garments; be should offer the 16 u parūras and offer to Mārkapdeya 1008, or 108 or 28 or eight offerings of fuel sticks, boiled rice, ghee, durvā, superior dishes with the mantra ( quoted below 1220). Then he should make a hom in honour of Mrtyuñjaya (Śiva) with oblations of dūrvā grass and sesame 10000, or 5000, or 3000 or one thousand in number and then he should sacrifice separately to the secondary objects of worship, viz. Asvatthaman, Bali, Vyāsa, Hanumat, Bibhiṣana, Krpa and Paraśurāma. Then he should perform a homa with fried grams according to his ability and should recite Srīsūkta, 1221 Rudra, the Āyusya mantras, the Purusasūkta and specially the complete recitation of the Veda; he should finish the homa and offer pūrṇāhuti; then water from the jar should be sprinkled over the yajamāna (i. e. person who has completed 60 years ), his wife and his near relatives; then there should be a japa of śānti hymn, the Puruṣasūkta, the mantra Rg. X. 18. 1, the Āyusya hymn, Pāvamāna hymn (hymn to Soma from Rg. IX. ), the six verses of Śivasaṅkalpa ( Vāj. S. 32.1-6), and Mahāśānti. Then the jar should be donated and the garments rendered wet by the abhiṣeku and a decked cow with calf should be donated to the officiating priest; ten (dūnas 1.22 to brāhmaṇas and gold weighing one hundred mūnas; he should perforın ājyāvekṣana and offer bali' (to all beings, crows &c.); he should then receive the blessings of the brāhmavas and put on a new garment; then he should have nirūjuna performed and bow to deities and feed a thousand or a hundred brāhmanas and then himself partake of food along with his relatives.

live for a hundred years, all misfortunes will vanish and all prosperity will be his. The prayoga (procedure of this sānti) is given below 1223 since it is often performed even now. 

It is difficult to say why this śānti was called Ugraratha. Another śānti on the completion of 70 years or on the 7th night of the 7th month of the 77th year is called Bhaimarathi-santi, according to the Sabdakalpadruma, which quotes some verses from Punyaka without stating what work is moant.1223 Baud. grhyasosasūtra I. 24 prescribes a śānti for one who has lived up to 100 years or one who has seen 1000 amirāsyis. 

The general rule about the time for santis is that no definite time can be fixed for them, since sānti rites are performed with the object of remoring the evil consequences of men's lapses suggested by such indications (or cmens) as dreams, the evil aspects of planets and the like i. e. they are to be performed as and when omens or portents occur or are observed and one should not wait for such times as the northward passage of the Sun, bright fortnight and that one may perform sāntis even in the southward passage of the Sun or even in an intercalary

month.1224 If there is no hurry, then a śānti was to be per formed on an auspicious week-day, an auspicious tithi and on certain nakṣatras, viz. the three Uttaras, Rohini, Śravaṇa, Dhaniṣthā, Satatārakā, Punarvasu, Svāti, Maghā, Aśvinī, Hasta, Pusya, Apurādhā and Revati.1225 As regards the Lakṣahoma the Matsya (93. 86 ) prescribes that it should be performed after securing favourable planets and Tūrūs (stars). Vide also p. 290 above about Kotihona prescribed by the Atharva-parisista ( XXXI pp. 187-191). The Matsya prescribes that a Kotihoma should be begun in Caitra or Kārtika (239. 20-21); the invisi bility of Jupiter and Venus and similar matters need not be considered when a śānti has to be performed immediately on the occurrence of an omen (or portent) or when the śānti is meant for alleviating the disease from which a person may be suffering, 

As against several udthurus and trūtas, texts prescribe a rite called Mahāśānti. The Sāṅkhāyana Gr.(V. 11 ) speaks of a Mahāśānti, when an ant-bill grows in one's house, which has been referred to abuve on p. 730 note 1162. The details of a Mahāśānti differ in different texts and on different occasions. The Ad bhuta-sāgara provides that where no specific details about santis against cortain utpūtas like a fall of meteors are prescribed one should have recourse to a sānti consisting in homa offerings to the accompaniment of one million repetitions of the sacred Gāyatri verse ('tat-savitur' &c. Rg. III. 62. 10) or to the Mahāśānti called Abhayā according to the nature (grave or light) of the omen or portent.1226 In the Marāļhi commentary on the

Nirnayasindhu (p. 233 ) about the question of a rite on the first appearance of a woman's monthly illness a japa of Mahāśānti is prescribed after an elaborate hoina and worship and the Malā śānti is explained as consisting of the recitation of Rg. 1. 89. 1-10 (beginning with 'ā no bhadra'), Rg. V. 51. 11-15 (beginning with 'spasti no mimitām &c.') and Rg. VII. 33. 1-15 ( begin ning with 'san-na Indrāgni'). The Bhaviscottara (113. 2-46) describes a Mahāśānti to be performed at a king's coronation, on his marching out on an invasion, when one has bad dreams or inauspicious omens (rimillas ), when the planots are un favourable or when there is lightning and the fall of moteors, when a Ketu appears, in it liurricane, carthquake, birth on a Mūla nakṣatra or Gardinta, on birth of twins, when parasols and banners fall on the grulind, when a crow, owl or pigeon enters a house, when malefic planets are retrograde (cspecially in the nakṣatra or rūsi uf birth), when Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and the Sun aro in the 1st, 1th, 8th or 13th houses (in a person's horoscope), when there is 01.11! yulelor; when garments, weapons, horses and cows, or jewels and hair are lost, or when rainbow is seen at night in front, when the beam on a house pillar is smashed, whon a sho-mule conceives, on eclipses of the Sun and the Moon-on these a Malāśānti is commended. The procedure is briefly as follows: Five learned and well-conducted brahmanas should officiato in & iniumpre ton or twelve cubits on each side, in the midst of which there should be a raised platform four cubits on each side and in the south-east corner of that platform there should be a kunılı (receptacle for fire). Five jars should be placed, four in the four intermediate quarters (south-east &c.) and the fifth in the middle of the platform and numerous things such as twigs and leaves of some plants, jetrels, sandalwood, mustard grains, suni and dūrưā, kuśrs and grains of rico sl:ould be collectod thorcon; Vedic mantras such as 'āśuḥ śiśāno' (Rg. X. 103.1) on north west, ' iśā vāsya'( Vāj. S. 40,1) on north-east, were to be recited over the jars, worship is to be offered with qanılhi, flowers, lamps, fruits like cocoanut to the jars and fire should be placed in the kundu with 'agnim dūtam' (Rg. I. 12. 1), seat (ūsuina) should be offerred with the mantra 'kiranya-garbhaḥ' (Rg. X. 121.1), then pūyusa should be cooked to the accompaniment of Puruṣa sūkta ( Rg. X. 90), eighteen fuel sticks of sami and seven palāśa ones should be cast into Agni, seven Thuis of clarified ghee and Boven of rice boiled in milk should be offered to Agni with a mantra 'Jātavedase' (Rg. I. 99. 1), four more with the hymn

tarat sa mandi'( R:y. IX. 53), seven with 'yamāya'(Rg. X. 14 13) and again seven with idam Viṣṇur' (Rg. I, 22. 17 ) and 27 āhutis to the 27 nakṣatras, then performance of 'sviṣtakrt' homa, grahahoma with sosame covered with gbee, then praya. Ścitta; thus ends the homa; then the ynjamuna sitting on a throne of kāśmarya wood should have sprinkled over him to the accompaniment of drum-beating and conch-blowing water from the five jars with five different mantras, then an offering to all the directions (viijlui) with the mantra 'salutation to all bhūtas'. Aftor the bath, brālınaras recite a śānti over him after letting full a stroam of s:inti water all round; then puṇyaha rūcunu and then close of the śānti rite, then gifts of land, gold, beds, seats according to the person's ability to brāhmaṇas; he should treat to a sumptuous meal the poor and helpless and men learned in the Veda. On doing this he secures long life, quick victory over enemies, even difficult undertakings succeed. 

The huge work Adbhutasāgara is mostly concerned with rare natural phenomena such as halo, rainbows, hurricanes, glowing horizon (laguūru), meteors, comets, earthquakes, rain without clouds, red rain, shower of fish, Fata Morgama &c. 

A few words must be said about some striking ones out of these. First comes earthquake. The Bṛ. S. (32.1-2) puts forth four theories of his predecessors about the cause of an earthquake viz. it was caused by huge animals dwelling inside the seas (view of Kāśyapa) or according to others (Garga ) it was caused by the heavy breaths emitted by the elephants of the quarters when tired by carrying the reight of the earth; others (like Vasistha) said that earthquake noise is caused by the winds striking against each other (in the sky) and falling on the earth; other acāryas (like Vṛddhagarga) held that an earthquake was caused by adsta (i. e, by the sins of the people on the earth 1977). In verses 3-7 of Br. S. (chap. 3:2) Varāba narrates the myth that mountains had in the dim past wings and the earth being much shaken by their movements approached Pitāmaha (Brabmā) and Brahmā seeing her sad plight asked Indra to discharge bis thunderbolt for clipping the wings of mountains and for removing the anger (or sorrow) of the earth; Indra did so, but he told the earth that Vāyu, Agni, Indra (himself) and 

1224. The ब्रह्मपुराण sets out a novel cause of earthquake 'यदा विजृम्भते. et AGUSTA99: I hear a F ATTET ATT U 21. 23-24; H. Ft. p. 383 quotes this verse from frutto with slight variations.

Varuṇa would (each) at different parts of the day and night make the earth shake in ordor to indicate (to mortals) the fruits of their good and bad deeds. In Bș. S. 32, 8-: Varāha describes the spheres and premonitory signs of Vāyu, Agni, Indra and Varuna with the nakṣatras and the countries they affect. The Adbhuta sāgara (pp. 383-409) quotes most of the rerses of Varāba and prese cribes sāntis for each of the four deities that are deemed to be con nected with earthquakes. Thc Adbhutusigara refers to earthquakes that happened when angry Arjuna got no sleop after he made a vow that he would kill Jayadratha before the next day's sunset (Dropaparva 77. +) and when Duryodhana challenged Bhima for a mace fight (Salyaparya 56.10 and 58.19). 

It should not be a matter for surprise that ancient and medieral Indians regarded earthquakos as punishments sent by God for the sins of men. The English poet Cowper gives vent to this belief in his poem 'Timepeace', 1228 The most distinguished Indian of modern times viz. Mahatmi Gāndhi, regarded the earthquake in Bihar that ocurred on January 15, 1934, and affected an area of about 30000 square iniles and a population of about 15 millions and that killed thousands and made millions homeless, as God's punishment for the prevalence of the evil system of untouchability in Hindu 1.24 society. To the natural and usual query why God should punish a small country or a small community with frightful earthquakes and overwhelm. ing waves when other countries and millions of other people are guilty of the same misdeeds, Cowper endeavours to give a reply 



1225. 1228, Wbat tien: 'ere they the wicked above all, 

And we ihe righteous, wbose fast-anchored isle Moved not, while theirs was rocked like a light skilf,

Earthquakes and comets

in the lines quoted above. It appears that, in spite of the be. liefs now discredited, Vṛddha Garga and Varāha appear to have also believed that comets had orbits like planets and were visible in the firmament at certain long intervals of time, 

The rules to be observed about eclipses have already been stated above (pp. 243-250). Though the real causes of lunar and solar eclipses were known long before the time of Varāha inihira as shown above (p. 242, n 622) this knowledge was not accopted by the masses for centuries and even now many people in India still entertain the old beliefs about eclipses.1230 Varāha criticises ancient writers like Vṛddha Garga and Parāśara who prophesied an eclipse when five planets including Mercury came together or there were such niinillas as halo of the Sun, dim rays 1231 ( Br. S. V. 16-17). Here the Santi for it will be briefly described. One view was that an eclipse was auspicious 1232 to a person, if the eclipse occurs when the Sun or the Moon is in the 3rd, 6th, 10th or 11th rāśi (zodiacal sign) from the rāśi of the birth of a person, it is noither auspicious nor inauspicious when any one of the two is in 2nd, 5th, 7th or 9th rāśi from that of birth and it is inauspicious when the eclipsed sun or moon is in the 1st, 4th, 8th and 12th rāśi from the rāśi of birth. The view of Garga was that if an eclipse occurs when the sun or moon is in the rāśi of the birth of a person or if any of them is in the 1st, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th or 12th rāśi from that of birth or if any of them occupies the nakṣatra of the birth of a person or the 9th nakṣatra from that of birth, it leads to calamities for that person. If an eclipse occurred when the Sun or Moon occupied the bakṣatra of the day of the coronation of the king, that portends the ruin of the kingdom, the loss of friends and

the death of the king. 1233 Atri said that when the eclipse of the Sun or Moon occurs in the nakṣatra of a person's birth, disease, journeys and death are portended, and great danger for the king (whose nakṣatra is so affected). The averting of evil would follow if the man makes gifts and is engaged (that day) in worship of gods and japa.1231 Several modes of śānti are pre scribed, particularly for him whose rāśi or nakṣatra of birth or one of three nakṣatras (viz. that of birth, the one preceding and the one following the pakṣatra of birth) is occupied by the eclipsed Sun or Moon. One way is to make the figure of a serpent (that represents the demon Rāhu) with gold or flour and to donate it to a brāhmaṇa. Another was to make a serpent out of gold weighing a palu ( i. e. 320 gunjas) or one half, one fourth or one eighth pala and to fix a jewel on its hood and place the sorpont figure in a vessel of copper, bronze or cast iron full of ghee and donate it with a daksiṇā and also donate a silver diso of the moon and a golden serpent when it is a lunar eclipse and a golden disc of the Sun and a golden serpent when it is a solar eclipse. Further gifts of a horse, chariot, cows, land, sesame, ghee and gold also are recommended. The mantra accompanying the gifts addressed to Rābu is quoted below.1235 The Nirnayasindhu also sets out a far more elaborate santi from the Matsyapurāṇa, which is passed over for reasons of space. 

• The fall of meteors (ulka) required a śānti. There were several beliefs about them. Garga held that they were missiles discharged by the Lokapālas 1236 who send down flaming meteore as missiles for indicating (coming) auspicious or calamitous events. Another view was that they were really souls that fell

The Adbhutasāgara (pp. 342-344) quotes & long passage (of 231 verses) from Atharvaṇādbhuta about the fall of meteors 1239 by day. It is said therein that such a fall of meteors by day portends the destruction of the country and its king and therefore a Mahāśānti called Amrtā should be por formed. There is an Atharvaṇa-parisista LVIII b on ulkā, but the Adbhutasāgara versos do not appear to have been extracted from that. 

Certain natural phenomena, though they may be oalled utpātas if they occur at certain times, are not to be regarded 28 such at certain other times. In Bṛ. 8. 45. 82 Varāha says that certain occurrencos natural to certain seasons do not lead to any unfavourable consequences; one should know them from the verses composed by Rṣiputra that are concise. Then he pro ceeds: in Madhu and Mādhaya (Caitra and Vaisakha) the following occurrences lead to good viz. lightning, meteors, earth quake, glowing twilight, noisy whirl-winds, halo (of Sun and Moon), dust in the sky, vapour (in forest), red sunrise and sunset; possibility of getting from trees food, rasas ( sweet &c.), oily substances, numerous flowers and fruits; and amorous activities among cows and birds. The following are beneficial ( auspicious ) in summer (Jyestha and Aṣadha) viz. sky rendered dusky by the fall of stars and meteors, or in which the appear ance of the Sun and the Moon is dark-brown, which is full of fiery glow without a flaring fire, loud noises, vapour, dust and

winds, in which evenings are like red lotus and which look like & stormy sea, and when rivers are dried up. In the rains (Srāvana and Bhadrapada) the following portend no dangor vis. rainbow, halo (of Sun and Moon), lightning, dried trees giving out fresh sprouts, the earth quaking or rolling or showing other than its usual appearance, noises in the earth or gaps therein, or when lakes increase in expanse of water or rivers rise up (in floods), or when wells are full or when houses on bills roll down. In Sarad (Āśvina and Kārtika) the following are not of evil import viz. the sight of divine damsels, ghosts, gandharvas, air conveyances and other adbhutas; the planets, nakṣatras and other stars becoming visible by day in the sky; noises of song and music in forests and on mountain peaks; abundance of crops and reduction of waters. In Hemanta (Mārgasirsa and Pauṣa ) the following are auspicious viz. the progence of cool winds and frost, loud cries of birds and beasts, the sight of raksas (evil spirits), Yaksas and other (usually invisible) beings, non-buman voices, directions darkened by vapour together with the sky, forests and mountains, the appearance of the rise and setting of the Sun at a higher point than usual, The following appearances are auspicious in Siśira (Māgha and Phālguna) viz. the fall of snow, portentous winds, sight of terrible beings and adbhutas, sky resembling dark collyrium and rendered reddish-yellow by the fall of meteors and stars, the birth of various strange issue from women, Cows, sheep, mares, beasts, and birds, strange appearances of leaves, sprouts and croopers. Those when seen in the proper seasons are auspicious in those respective seasons, but when soon at other than the proper seasons they are very terrible portents. Two verses 1940

The occurrence of these twelve verses ( 45. 83–94 ) both in Bṛ. S. and Viṣṇudbarmottara raises the importaot question of the chronological relation of tbe two works. Varāhamihira expressly tells us tbat he took the twelve verses ( 45. 83-94 ) from Ropatra or shortened them. Therefore, be did not borrow from the Vigaud basmottara, Roipatra has been often quoted by Varžba in bis works (vide above p. 593 and my paper in JBBRAS for 1948-49, vol 24-25, p. 15).

about Madhu-Madhava and the last one (Bļ. 8. 45. 84-85 and 95) are quoted below. The Bṭ. S. further provides 124 that whatever Gāthas ( prakrit verses or simply verses) are recited by persons of distracted intellect, the utterances of children and what women speak out does not turn out to be wrong and that a person that understands utpātas, even though he may be devoid of mathema tics (about planets), becomes famous and a favourite of the kingi and by knowing the secret (or esoteric ) words of the sage ( Rsiputra ) which are stated (by me), a person sees the past, the present and the future,

ID my 'History of Sanskrit Poetics' (1951) pp. 64–70 I arrived for the Viṣṇudharmottara at a date between 500-600 A, D. on other evidence. In my opinion it is probable that the Viṣṇud harmottara borrows the verses from the Brbat-gambitā. If that he accepted, tbe Vigoudbarmottara (at least the 2nd section of it ) must be later than 600 A, D. It is possible to argue that the Purāṇa might have taken them from Rsipatra. But the Purāṇa does not say so and in keeping with the assumed character of the Purāgas as composed by the semi-divine Vyāsa at the beginning of Kali yoga, the Purāṇas generally take care pot to admit aby borrowing from a merely human author. It should be noted that three of the verses quoted only from Yogayātrā of Varāba by 37. \#l. p. 494 occur in payanter U. 176, 9-11.

Viṣṇu the Matsyapurāṇa 1244 states the images of all gods shut and open their eyes, laugh, weep, scream, emit smoke, blaze, and these signs indicate that great danger impends. In the Atharvana-parisiṣta 1245 LXXII this matter is treated (in prose). It says there are portents called dryja which occur in temples ; they (images) laugh, sing, weep, shriek, perspire, Cause smoke to issue out of them, they blaze, they tremble, open their eyes and shut them, blood oozes from them, they move to and fro' These strange phenomena are said to forebode drought, danger from weapons, famine, epidemic in the country and destruction of the king and his ministers (or relatives). The śānti pre scribed in the same Atharvaṇa-parisista (4.7) is as follows: one should boil pāyasa in the milk of 108 kapilā cows; if such cows are not available one should cook payasa with the milk of one hundred milch cows; he should put on the fire fuel sticks with ends towards the east, should spread round the fire darbha grass and should offer oblations (of rice) in fire to the accompaniment of the mantras addressed to Rudra 1245 and called Raudra-gana and also offer clarified butter (in fire). He should present white flowers, he should treat brāhmaṇas with boiled rice and should donate the same cows (the milk of which was used for cooking payaga ) or donate the kingdom for a limited period for the satisfaction of a brāhmaṇa; he should give to the officiating priest a thousand cows and donate a good village. * Now śāntis on the birth of human beings should be referred to. There are several śāntis concerning the birth of a human being, such as a child's birth on Mūla, Aśleṣā, Jyesthā nakṣatras, on gan lanta, on the 14th tithi of the dark fortnight or on

amāvāsyā, on Vyatipata-yoga or on Vaidhfti or in an eclipse, or on the birth of twins, or when a girl is born to a person after three successive births of sons or a son is born after three sucoes give births of girls. Some of those sāntis are performed even now. Therefore two of them which are still in vogue, though gradually becoming infraquent, are briefly described here. The consequences of birth on Mūla, Jyesthā and Asleṣā are more or legs similar. Here the śānti for birth on Āśleṣā is briefly set out. 

The Asleṣā nakṣatra has a mean measure of 60 ghaṭia. It is to be divided into ten parts in order 13466 viz. 5, 7, 2, 3, 4, 8, 11, 6, 9 and 5; birth of a son in these parts indicates in order the loss of kingdom, death of father, death of mother, addiction to lovemaking, he has devotion to father, has strength, loses pro perty, has proneness to charity, pleasures,'wealth. If the nakṣatra be divided into four parts, birth in the first part is auspicious but in the other three parts indicates loss of wealth, death of father, death of mother. If the child is a girl born on the last three quarters of Āśleṣā indicates the death of the future mother-in-law of the girl; if the child be a boy and is born in the last three quarters of Āśleṣā, that indicates death of his future mother-in-law. One should perform a sānti for birth on any quarter of Aśleṣā, either on the 12th day from birth, or if that be not possible, on the next Aśleṣā or on any auspicious day. On that day he (the father or other performer) should make a saṅkalpa 1247 as noted below

He should worship Rudra and Varuṇa on two jars, should invoke the serpents, the lords of Asleṣā, on an image placed on a jar established on the figure of a lotus with twentyfour petals and invoke Brhaspati, the lord of Pusya nakṣatra, to the south of the jar (for serpents ) and the pilys (the lords of Maghā) to the north of Āślostī jar and invoke on the twentyfour petals, beginning from the petal which is due east and proceeding to the right therefroni, twentyfour deitios beginning with Blaga, the lord of Purvi Phalguni up tu Aditi, lord of Punarva:u; then he should invoke the lulinpalas (eight); then worsbip all the deities invoked, establish firo (fur homa) and the planets and perform amihem ( putting fuel uil the sacred Agni). After the minihame of the Sun and other planets he should offer to the principal doities, viz. the serpents, 108 or 28 of each of the materials viz. pāyasi mixed with gheo, fuel sticks, clarified butter and boiled rice, to Brhaspati and pitis 25 or 8 offerings of the same materials and to tho ?+ deitios (uf nakṣatras ) riz Bhaga and the rest eight lies vf piyasu tu each with the rerse 'rak-chaium' (Rg.

A śānti for the birth of a child on the 14th tithi of the dark half is still in vogue and the author knows abuut it personally; it is described at length in the Madanaratna (fulio 24 from Gārgya) and in Sānti-kamalakara. The santi on the birth of a child on Mūla nakṣatra is described in Madanaratna from Garga (folio 27b to 286,)one peculiarity of which is that the father had to collect one hundred roots of trees and plants (mūla means 'root'). Vide also Sinti-kamalākara (folio 77a). 

( Continued from last page) hadd it over to the mother w bo should pass it on to the father who should then return it to the mother The child should be placed on a piece of cloth and the father should look at the face of the infant Then the priest should Bprinkle the infant with drops from the mixture of cow's urine, duog, milk, curds and gbee with the maotras begioning with 'Apo bi sthā' (Rg.

The birth of a girl after three successive births of boys or of a buy after three successive births of girls was supposed to indicate unfavourable consequences to the parents and the family and death of the eldest, loss of wealth and great sorrow. There fore a śānti was recommended on the 1lth or 12th day from the birth of a girl or buy (as the case inay be) or on an auspicious day, He (the father) should choose ācārys (chief officiating priest) and otlier priests, then perform a sacrifice to planets and offer worship to the golden image. vf Lralnā, Vionu, Śiva and Indra on a jar placed on a heap of grains. On a fifth jar he should worship Rudra and und lrūhrera should recite four hymns to Rudra oleven times and all -intisuktas when homa is being performed. Tlie acarya should cast into the fire fuel-sticks, ghee. sesamo and boiled rice 100, 105 or 360 times to four deities viz. Brahmā, Vislu, Mahosa and Indra respectively with the mantras 'Brahma jajñānam' (Tai. S. IV. 2. 8.2., Vāj. S. 13. 3), 'idam Viṣṇur' (Rer. I. .17), 'Tryanabakam yajāmahe' (Rg. VII, 59. 12, Vata Indra bhayāmahe' (Rg. VIII, 61. 13). Then he should perform "Sviṣirket' homa, 12's then offer bali and pārnūkus. The family members should be sprinkled with the sacred water. The performer should bonour the ācārya and donate sono gold and a col to himn and gire caliṣiṇā to the other priests, should louk into il vessel full of ghee and should make tho brūhmanas recito scinti versos. The images with the addi tions or decorations thereof should be donated to the guru, brahmanas, puor and helpless peuple should be fed according to his ability. By doing this sānti all misfortunes are destroyed. (Nirnayasindhu p. 218 and Sintiratnākaru, folio 109). 

The Kausikasutrit (kawikis 110 and 111), Br̥hatsamhita 12-19 (chap. 15.51--5+) and the Adihutasizara pp. 539-569 deal at length with the purtants of births tu women, cows, mares, she asses &c.

destruction of the country or family'. The Matsyapurāṇa 235. 1-3 and Viṣṇudharmottara II, 140. 1-3 have identical verses similar to the above. The Bhlsmaparva 1250 (chap. 3.2-7) refers to portentous births such as the following ; 'pregnant women and women who had never before given birth to sons produce mon strosities; so also even wives of men who are Vedic scholary are giving birth to eagles and peacocks, mares give birth to calves, dogs to jackals; some women have given birth to four or five girls (at the same time) &c.: The Bṛ. S. proceeds 1251 'If mares, camels, she-buffaloes and cow-elephants give birth to twins, that portends death to them. The effect of such births will come to pass about six months later; Garga has declared twu ślukas as to the śānti in such cases. The women that give birth (to twins or monstrosities ) should be removed to another place (ur country) by one that desires his own happiness, he should gratify brābmaṇas by gifts of things desired by them and should cause & śānti (propitiatory rite) to be performed; as to quadrupeds, they should be removed from their flocks or herds and be aband oned in other countries; otherwise there would be ruin of the town, the owner and the flock or herd.' 

Various modes were employed to divine the future, viz. (1) the position of planets and stars, (3) indiridual horoscopes, (3) flight and cries of birds like khasjana and crow, (+) natural phenomena (eclipses, meteors &c.), (5) dreams, (6) voices suddenly heard, (7) the physical and mental conditions of mon, animals &c. The first four hare already been briefly dealt with. Now dreams will be taken up for discussion. 

It has already been geen (p. 728, notes 1157 and 1158) how in the Vedic literature dreams had been associated with good luck or ill-luck. The two epics, the Svapnādhyāya (of Atharvana-pari. śista LXVIII pp. 438-449), the Brhad-yoga-yātrā of Vāraha (chap. 16.1-31 ), Purāṇas such as Vāyu (chap. 19.13–18), Matsya (chap.242), Vispudharmottara (II. 176), Bhaviṣya I. 194, Brahma vaivarta-purāṇa (Ganesa-khanda 34. 10-40 ), describe good or bad dreams; Agni (229, many verses of which are the same

Works on sāntis about dreams

as those of Matsya chap. 242), Bhujabala of Bhoja (pp. 298-304 verses 1347-1378 ), the Adbhutasāgara pp. 493-515 deal at length with the matters relating to dreams and śāntis therefor. Saṅkarā cārya in his commentary on Vodāntasūtra 1952 remarks that those who have studied the Svapnādhyaya declare that to see oneself riding on an elephant or the like is auspicious and to see oneself sitting in a conveyance drawn by asses is inauspicious (or unlucky). It appears that rarely an ancient writer like Angiras 1253 said 'the movements of planets, dreams, nimittas (like throbbing), utpātas ( portents) produce some consequences by chance; wise men are not afraid of them'. Numerous dreams are mentioned in the Rimāyapa on several occasions. Some examples may be given. In the Sundarakānda (chap. 27,3 ff) Trijatā (a rūkṣasi ) details several dreams that she saw and that indicated the destruction of rāksasas and that were favourable to Rāma. Among the evil omens that she saw in her dream about Rāvana were; he had his head shaved, he drank oil with which he was drenched, he was dressed in red garments, was intoxicated, wore wreaths of Karavira flowers, he fell on the earth from his puspaka balloon, he was carried in a chariot drawn by asses, he was wearing red 

flowers and was anointed with red unguents &c. (verses 19-27). Similar dreams occur as seen by Trijatā in the story of Rāma contained in the Vanaparra chap. 280. verses 64-66. In the Ayodhyākā»da (chap. 69. 8. ff) Bharata who was with his maternal uncle saw in a dream his father (Dasaratha) dirty and with disherelled hair, falling from a mountain peak in a turbid lake full of cowdung, drinking that dirty water and oil; he also saw the ocean dried up and the moon fallen on the earth, he saw his father seated on a dark seat of iron and wearing black gar ments and beaten by women dark and tawny in colour, he saw him going to the south in a chariot drawn by asses &c. Bharata says that these dreams indicated the death of the king (Daśaratha) or of Rāma or Lakṣmana. In the Mausalaparya of the Mahā bhārata (chap. 3. 1-4) the Yādavas saw in dreams a black woman with whitish teeth running to Dvārakā with a laugh and kidnapping their women and terrible vultures were seen to be devouring the Vrsnis and Andhakas in their own houses in which sacred fires had been establisbed &c.

quoting the Fun 

One passage froni 

5031 is cited here 

It is impossible to point out the unlucky and lucky dreams as their number mentioned in Adbhutasagara (pp. 502-513), quoting the Purāṇas, Parāśara, the works of Varāba and others is extremely large. One passage from the Matsyapurana ( 242 verses 2-14, quoted in Adbhutasāgara pp. 502-503) is cited here by way of illustration; 'the springing of grass and plants from one's body (except from the navel); bronze vessels dashed against one's head and pulverized; sharing of the head; nakedness; wearing dirty garments; bath with oil; being smeared with mud; fall from a bigh spot (hill &c.); sitting in a swing, collecting mud and iron; killing horses; ascond ing trees that have flowers and over circles and riding boars, bears, asses and camels; eating of (the flesh of) birds and fishes and oil and rice mixed with midga or maṣa; dancing, laughing, marriage and singing; playing on musical instru monts other than stringed ones; going for a dip in a river; bath with water mixed with cowdung or mud or with water fallen on bare earth; entering the womb of one's mother; ascending a funeral pyre; the fall of Indra's banner; the fall of the Sun and the Moon; seeing portents of the three kinds (heavenly, those in atmospheric regions and earthly); anger of gods, brāhmaṇas, kings and one's lux; embracing maidons; sodomy; loss of one's limbs; vomiting and purging; going to the southern direction; being overwhelmed by a disease; fall of fruits and of flowers; fall of houses; sweeping of houses with a broom; playing with goblias, birds or animals that subsist on putrid flesh, monkeys, bears and men; humilia tion by strangers (or enemies); arising of calamity brought on by another person (or enemy); wearing ochre-coloured garments; playing with women; plunging into oil or drinks; wearing red flowers and applying red unguents; these and others are inaus picious dreams. 

In the Brhadyogayātrā 1254 Varāba prescribes that the king wearing silken garments, pearls and jewels and accompanied by 

1254. यज्जाग्रतो दूरमुवैति देवमाश्य मन्त्रान प्रयतखिरेतान् । लकमुग्दक्षिणपार्श्वशायी खमं परीक्षेत यथोपदेशम् ॥ नमः शम्भो त्रिनेत्राय गन्द्राय वरदाय च । वामनाय विरूपाय समाधि पतये नमः । भगवन् देवदेवेश शुलभूषवाहन। इष्टानिष्टे समाचदा स्वमे सुतस्य शाश्वतम् ॥ वृहद्योगयात्राq. by अ.सा. p. 494; the two verses नमः शम्भो occuria विष्णुधर्मोत्तर. 176. 9-10 and also the reference to 'yajjāgrato' (occurs in verse 11). That first mantra is q uitarar i ag they auara I Fā sulfat Filet mig मनः शिवसङ्कल्पमस्तु । (पाज, सं. 34.1). This byma is called शिवसइल्प (vide मनु XI. 250). 

The manner of examining king's dream 

777 

astrologers and purohita should enter the temple of his favourite deity, should place the images of the dikpālas therein, worship them with mantras, place four jars full of water in the four directions, should thrice repeat the mantras beginning with *Yajjāgrato dūram' (Vaj. S. 34. 1), should eat only once that day, sleep on his right side and pray to Rudra (as noted in n 1254) and examine the dream, auspicious or inauspicious, seen towards the close of night. 

The Matsya (242.21-35) sets out1255 lucky dreams as follows: ascending (or riding on) mountains, palaces, elephants, horses and bulls; going among troos having white flowers; the shooting of trees and grass from the navel and seeing (the sleeper) endowed with many hands or heads; wearing garlands of very white flowers and very white garments; eclipse of the Sun, Moon and nakṣatras; sprinkling water (on one's body) all over; embracing or raising the banner of Indra; seizure of the earth and seas; slaughter of enemies; victory in disputes, in gambling and in battle; eating of wet (fresh) meat, of fish and of pāyasa (rice boiled in milk and sugar); seeing blood or being bathed with it; drinking liquor, blood, intoxicants and milk; being surrounded on the earth with intestines; sight of bright sky; sucking the udders (the milk) of cows and she-buffaloes and of lionesses, cow-elephants and maros; receiving favours from (images of) gods, gurus and brāhmaṇas; bath with water flowing from the horns of cows or falling from the Moon (this prognos ticates the acquisition of a kingdom); being crowned as a king: the cutting of one's head; one's death; being burnt by fire; one's house and the like being burnt down by fire; securing the insignia of royalty; playing on the lute; swimming beyond waters; crossing difficult places; the delivery in one's own house of cows, mares and cow-elephants; being mounted on horses; weeping; obtain ing of handsome women or embracing them; being bound with fetters; being smeared with excreta; seeing living kings and friends; seeing images of gods and pure (or pellucid) waters. On seeing such auspicious dreams a man easily secures per manent wealth and he who is suffering from a disease becomes 

free from it. 

In the Jain Kalpasūtra of Bhadrabāhu (8. B. E. vol. XXII, p. 129) fourteen very auspicious dreams seen by the brahmani Dovanandā are enumerated, viz: an elephant, a bull, a lion,

anointing of the goddess Sri, a garland, the Moon, the Sun, a flag, a vase, a lotus lake, the ocean, celestial abode, a heap of jowels, a flame and on pp. 231-238 elaborate details of these dreams are given. 

Matsya (chap. 243. 2-12) sets out the sights that are unlucky when they come before a king who is going on an invasion (such as improper drugs, corn with dark exterior, cotton, grass, dry cow dung and many others) and prescribes that on seeing these for the first time he should worship Kośava with a laud and that if he sees it a second time he should enter his palace. Yogayātrā (chap. 13. 4 ff) provides what the king starting on an expedition should hear viz. such recitations as that of the Veda, Vedangas, Dharmaśāstras, Arthaśāstra, Mahābhārata, Rāmāyana, Purāpa passages. Matsya (chap. 243.15-25) proscribes the sights that are auspicious (such as white flowers, jars full of water, aquatic birds, meat and fish, flaming fire, courtezans, Durva grass, fresh cowdung, gold, silver, copper and all jewels besides Beveral others and winds up with a fine sentiment, 1256 viz. the ease (or satisfaction ) of one's mind is the highest sign of success; on one side are all prognostications and on the other is the mind's ease. The Bșhad-yogayātra of Varāha has a similar verso. Vide H. of Dh. vol, II pp. 511, 876 and notes 1192 and 2048 therein for two sets of auspicious sights. The Jyotistattva (pp. 729 730) quotes several verses on the objects that are auspicious or inauspicious when seen by a person starting on a journey or expedition and remarks that the same objects when seen in a dream are of the same ( auspicious or inauspicious ) quality. The Vasantarāja-śākuna (V. 2-6) sets out fifty objects that are auspicious when starting on a journey or entering & homo such as curds, sandal wood, ghee, dūrvā, a jar full of water &c. and (V. 10-11) specifies the thirty objects that are inauspicious. 

The Matsya provides 1257 : “ dreams seen in the first watch of the night bear fruit in a year, those seen in the 2nd watch after

six months, those seen in the third watoh after three months and those seen in the last watch in a month. If on the same night one goes both auspicious and inauspicious dreams, one (the astrologer ) should declare that the last dream (alone) will yield consequences. Therefore, when a person sees an auspicious dream ho should not go to sleep thereafter. Declaring a bad dream to another is commended as also sleeping after seeing it; bath with water mixed with the viscous sediment of oily substances, homa of sesame, honouring brahmanas, hymn of praise to Vāsudova and worship of him and listening to the story of the liberation of Gajendra- those remove the evil effects of bad dreams." In connection with the vrata called "Siddhar thakadi-saptami' performed for gaining the favour of the Sun the Bhaviṣya (Brahma-parva, 194. 1-25) sets out the dreams which are auspicious or favourable to the person performing the vrata Those verses are similar to those in the Matsya and are quoted by Kr̥tyakalpataru (on vrata pp. 176-179). One verse says 'on seeing a favourable dream one should not sleep again, but declare in the morning the dream as seen to Bhojakas and brāhmaṇas (or to Bhojaka brāhmaṇas).' The Bșhadyoga yātrā contains similar verses as quoted by Adbhutasagara p. 501. 

The Jyotistativa quotes 1258 a verse 'I shall declare what matters seen in dreams tend to bring knowledge (of impending consequences) to men who do not understand the true nature

(significance) of objects seen in dreams that arise from their meritorious or sinful actions (in previous lives)' and remarks that from this verse it follows that dreams are purely indicative and do not produce consequences (by themselves). The higher thought in India held that dreams were only indicative or suggestive of future auspicious or inauspicious events, as affirmed by the Vedantasātra (III.2.4) and by Saṅkarācārya's comment ary thereon. On the other hand Bhujabala provides 1259 'to sleep again (after a dream), not to declare it to another, bath in the Ganges, japa ( of holy texts), santi, suastyayana (asking brahmanas to say it would be auspicious'), to resort in the morning to cows and an Asyattha tree, honouring brāhmaṇas with food mixed with sesame, with gold and flowers according to one's means, merit-giving recital of the Mahabharata-these tend to destroy (the effects of) bad dreams.' Bhujabala further says that all white objects except cotton, ashes, bones, butter milk are auspicious (in dreams) and all dark objects except Cows, images of gods, elephants, horses and brāhmaṇas are 

inauspicious. 

The Atharvana-parisista1260 LXVIII (pp. 438-449) states that persons have different dreams according as their constitu tions (prakrti) are choleric or windy or phlegmatic (pitta, rata and kapha) and long lists of dreams and their interpretations are given and it prescribes the same remedies against bad dreams as Varabia does.

IL 28.10, Tai. 8. IV. 14-123) 'O king Varuṇa ! protect us from the danger which may helper or friend declares to me (from what I saw) in a dream or from the thief or wolf who desires or is about to injure us'; or one may recito inaudibly the verse Adha svapnasya' (Rg.

All ancient countries and peoples believed in dreams and satisfied their curiosity to know the future by interpreting them. The Chaldean astrologers and dream-interpreters were in high favour at Babylonian and Assyrian courts. The Book of Daniel (chap. 2) tells us how Nebuchadnezzar, a great king of Babylon, asked the Chaldeans not only to interpret dreams but commanded them on threat of death to make known to him the dream which he had forgotten and then to interpret it. Plato, the greatest of the Greek philosophers, regards dreams as important physical and paychio symptoms while certain dreams are con coded as of supernatural origin and explains in his Timaeus (chap. 46 and 47) that dreams are prophetic visions received by the lower appetitive soul (through the liver). In JRAS (old series) vol, 16 pp. 118-171 N. Bland contributos a long and inter esting article on the Mahomedan science of. Tābir or inter pretation of dreams.' There are striking parallels between the rules to be observed by the dreamer and by the interpreter and the principles of interpretation (of dreams) by contrarios and by dependence upon the religion, country and bodily conditions (such as total fast or full stomach) of the dreamer. On p. 141 of JRAS there is an interesting account of a dream of Nushirwan, a Sassanian :king. (531-579 A. D.), who saw & dream that he drank from a golden goblet and that a black hog put its head in the goblet and drank from it. Then we are told 'Buzurmihr, his minister, whom he consulted, told him it signi fied that his favourite princess had a black slave who was her loyer and suggested that the women of his harem should be ordered to dance undressed in the presence of the king. One of them showing some hesitation in complying and being protected by the others was discovered to be a Hindu male slave and the

Vazir's interpretation was verified.' The name of the Vazir romarkably agrees in sound with the name Varāhamihira and it is not very fantastic to suppose that Varāhamihira, probably the most famous astrologer and astronomer of early times in India, had been patronized by Nushiryan and held a high position in his court. Chronology is quite in favour of this identification since Varāhamibira takos śaka 427 (505 A. D.) as the starting point for finding out the ahargana. 

In modern 1261 times many educated people think dreams as of no consequence whatever, while there are others who regard dreams as almost infallible indicators of coming events; there is also a third class of people who are willing to listen to the argu ments advanced on behalf of the interpretors of dreams and also of those who regard thoughts on the use and value of dreams as frivolous. To those who want to hear arguments on both sides and to form a judgment of their own about dreams, I would recommend the 'Fabric of Dreams' by Catherine Taylor Craig ( Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, London, 1918); Freud's 'Interpretation of dreams' is the most important of his works, in which he develops his psycho-analytic technique. Then there is the work Second sight in daily life' by W. H. W. Sabine who has a theory of his own. His work deals with precognition (or foreknowledge ) which according to him is a sub division of Extra-sensory perception. He propounds the theory that the mind comprises of not only normal memory appearing to derive from physical perception but also 'anticipatory memory' deriving from the Basic Experience which from time to time passes to some degree into conscious awareness. Time is one and does not exist except as a verbal convonience and that what we call 'future' has already happened but it is not indicated in what form it has happened. Considerations of space and rele vance preclude further discussion of this subject here. 

Certain other interesting śāntis will now be described. When a great-grandson (prapautra i. e, a son's son's son ) 1262

M, Muoghi Jubilee volume' (Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, Bombay 1948) an interesting paper (pp. 241-268) on 'two illustrated manuscripts on dreams', the contents of which do not attempt any elaborate theory about dreams but record empirical observations on dreams for the guidance of people in general.

is born to a person a santi has to be performed when he goes the face of the great-grandson. The saṅkalpa 1263 is given below. He should perform the rites beginning with the worship of Ganeśa and ending with Mātspūjā, then establish a jar full of water and worship (the image of) Varuṇa therein, perform the rite of nirājana 1264 to the accompaniment of the sound of drums, sit on a seat of udumbara tree covered with a blanket and should request brāhmaṇas to sprinklo sacred water on his person. The brāhmaṇas should sprinkle water on him to the accompaniment of a hymn to Varuna and a hymn to the Ganges. At the end of the abhiṣeka the performer should give up old garments and wear now ones and should worship the Ganges. Melted ghee should be put in a vessel of bronze and the performer should see the reflection of his face therein and then should see the face of his great-grandson in the light of a lamp placed in & golden vessel. Then he should sprinkle drops of water on the great-grandson with one hundred flowers of gold. Then he should sprinkle the great-grandson with water from the jar Used for abhiseka. For completing the ceremony of seeing the face of the grandson, he should donate a cow and feed brahmanas according to his means. Then he should worship an image of Viṣṇu, offer pāyasa to it and address the following prayer 1265 'O Viṣṇu ! by your favour I have seen the face of my great-grand son. Therefore, O Lord I in all ways and always do what I desire'. Then the image should be donated with the mantra 'by the dona tion of the image (of Vispu) may all evil influences of planets be always conjured away in the case of the child, o enemy of Kamsa and the Lord of the worlds,' and he should donate to the brāhmaṇas the ghee in which he saw his face.

such as good health, the removal of the diseases due to the three constituent elements of the human body, viz, hile, phlegm and rata (wind), that may have already arisen or are likely to arise, or for mitigating all the trouble that is causod by planets occupying unfavourable positions from the lima in a person's horoscope or from the rūśi of his birth, for removing the impurity on birth or death in one's bouse or family, for securing a happy life. Therefore, the saṅkalpa may assume various forms that are noted below. 1266 In modern times this is a very elaborats rite in which a very large number of Vedic verses are repeated and which takes up about three hours for its performance, Therefore, even a brief resume of the modern procedure is not attempted here. But one of the oldest available descriptions of this rite contained in the Baudhāyana-gļhya-seṣasūtra (I. 14) is set out here in order to convey an idea of this sānti. As the Baudhāyana-sūtras are closely connected with the Taittiriya samhitā and Brāhmaṇa the references to mantras and texts are cited as far as possible from that Samhitā and Brābmana. Many of the mantras occur also in the Rgreda and other samhitās. Here are the texts; waters indeed are faith; (when a priest takes water) he begins (the rite with) faith itself; waters are indeed the sacrifice, he begins sacrifice itself; water is indeed thunder bolt, he strikes the thunderbolt against enemies; waters are destroyers of malignant spirits (and it is taken) for destroying evil spirits; waters are the favourite abode (or seat) of the gods; waters are indeed nectar; therefore people sprinkle with water him who faints; waters are indeed all gods; he begins with gods. Waters indeed are well disposed; he (priest) removes with the kindly (waters) the pain of this person (the sacrificer); this is (what) the Brāhmaṇa (text) eays. . 

Therefore (the priest.) prepares propitiatory 1267 water with two kuśas dipped therein. One should commence a śānti on the nakṣatra of (a person's birth) or on an auspicious nakṣatra or when auspicious rites are to be performed, viz. marriage, a (child's) tonsure, upanayana, Vedic student's return home, hairparting (of a pregnant woman), establishment of the Vedic fires and other

S. IV. 2. 8. 2). Then he pours water across the two blades of darbha grass and mutters tat-savitur-varenyam' (Rg. III. 62. 10) and throws in the water) whole grains of rice and yavas with the formula 'bhūr-bhuvah-su yarom' (Tai. A. X. 2.1). Then he spreads around flowers, dūrvā grass and fruits, covers it (jar) with dūrvās and darbhas and touches with the verge "san-no devir' (Rg. X. 9. 4). When the brāhmaṇas have placed themselves besides the officiating priest, he mutters the verso tat-savitur varenyam'(Rg. X. 62. 10) separately by each foot and by half verse in one breath and mutters the first words of (all) the Vedas. Then he recites the following 1269 viz. the anurāka beginning with 'krṇuṣva pājaḥ' (Tai, S. I. 2. 14) but omit ting the hall vorge 'made cid-asya' (Tai, S. I. 2. 14. 7), the anuvāka beginning with 'indram vo' (Tai. S. I. 6. 12), with the two verses 'yata indra' (Rg. VIII. 61. 13, Tai. 5. X. 1. 9), and 'svastida' (Rg. X. 152. 2, Tai. A.

sprinkled with the mixture. Similarly, the Matsya 1275 proscribes for one in whose birth rāśi an eclipse takes place & gacred bath with water from four jars full of water in which earth from the stables of horses, elephants, from an ant-hill, from a confluence, a deep reservoir of water, from a cowpen and from entrance of a palace is cast, and also pancagavya, five jewels, rocanā, lotusos, sandalwood, saffron, usira, guggulu; mantras also are to ac company the bath; Indra, Varuṇa, Kubera and other gods are invoked for removing the evil results of eclipses. 

If a person suffers from fever the Madanaratna (folio 11) provides for sāntis for the tithis (from the first onwards) on which the fever started, derived from Baudhāyana in which the presiding deity of each tithi is to be offered worship (pūjā) and homa, for each of which the mantra (of which japa is to be made ) is different, and the incense, flowers, naivedya also are different. There are also śāntis, when a person suffers from fover, about the weekday on which the fever started and images of the presiding deity of the weekday made of different metals according to the name of the day are to be worshipped with different mantras (Madanaratna, folio 12a). For example, if føver started on a Sunday or on a Monday, then the images of Rudra (for Sunday) and Pārvati (for Monday ) were to be made of gold or silver and the mantras to be recited were respectively 'yā te Rudra' (Tai. S. IV. 5. 1. 1), 'gaurir-mimāya' (Rg. I. 164. 41). The gandha, flowers, incense, lamp and nairedya were different in each case. If the fever starts on any one of the 27 nakṣatras, the Madanaratna (folios 126-15b) prescribos śāntis for all the 27 nakṣatras, specifying the deity of each pakṣatra, the figure of the deity, its colour, mantra, the five upacāras from gandha, the kinds of fuel-sticks to be employed, the āhutis, the gifts &c. If the mantra 176 be not known, the

The mantras prescribed for religious worship and rites have a certain pattora, tbat is, they either refer to the rite to be performed and the deity or to the benefit prayed for or there is some word therein that indicates an application of it to the deity. For example, the mantra 'Grace a (Rp 1. 99. 1) is employed for lovokiog the presence of Durgā, because therein occars the word ' durgāni' (\# a:quafa goio pasar) or the verse 'Gaorir

Gayatri mantra (Rg. II. 6%. 10) was to be employed and the ābutis were to be 1008 or 108 according to the nature of the disease. The Madanratna (folios 15b-20b) quotes from Atreya further details about the 27 nakṣatras, via the number of stars in each nakṣatra, whether a nakṣatra is masculino, feminine or neuter, its figure, colour, deity, tree, its garza 177 (whether devagana or rāksasagana or manusyagana), what actions should be done on each, the Viṣanāds of each. 

The Dharmasindhu provides a sānti for the extremely rare occurrence of a person coming to life after people thinking him to be dead take his body for cremation to a cometery. The person in whose house such a person enters meets death There fore, & homa should be performed wherein eight thousand udumbara fuel-sticks anointed with milk and ghee are to be offered to the accompaniment of the Gāyatri mantra (Rg. II. 62. 10). At the end of the homa a kapila cow and a bronze vessel full of sesame should be donated to a brahmana; the bronze vessel should weigh 81 palas or 40% or 20+ or 9, 6 or at least three palas according 1277 to one's means. 

Some works prescribe & śānti on the delivery of a cow in the month of Bhadrapada, of a she-buffalo in Pausa and of a mare by day. The sānti is to be performed with 108 āhutis of ghee and sesame, the Asyavāmiya hymn (Rg. I 164) and the mantra 'tad-Viṣpoh' (Rg. I 22.20 ) are to be recited. It was supposed that if a sho-buffalo was delivered in Māgha and on a Wednesday, or a mare in Srāvana by day or a cow while the 

(Continued from last page) mimāya' ( Rg. 1. 164, 41 ) is said to be mantra for Parvati, the presiding deity of Monday, because the word 'Gaurir' suggests Gauri, which is a Dame of rent.

Sun is in the Lion sign, that portonds death of the 1778 owner in six months. It may be stated that in the author's boyhood such sāntis, particularly in the case of she-buffaloes, were performed. The Adbhutasāgara provides that the śānti should be performed on the 4th, 9th, 12th or 14th tithi, as these are declared to be auspicious tithis for adbhuta-śānti.1279 

In modern times the entrance into a newly built house is preceded on the same day or on a previous day by a śānti called Vastusanti 1280 or Vastu-samana (in Matsya 268. 3). It has been described at some length in H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 834-836. The description 1280a there is based on Matsya, chapters 256 and 268. Vāstusamana is also described in the Āśvalāyana gshya II.9.6-9, Par. gr. III. 4. 5-18, Baud gr. III. 5(which are cert ainly older than Matsya by several centuries), in Baudhāyana gxhyasesa-sutra I. 18, the Samavidhāna-brahmana III. 3.5 and several medieval works. The Baud. Gr. S. S. calls it Grhasanti and recommends that it be performed every month, every season or every year in the bright fortnight on an auspicious Dakṣatra by one who desires prosperity in his house. It is therefore passed over here. The Asv.gr is very brief. It says 1281 : Then

There is adeity in the Rgveda called 'Vistospati' (lord of the house). बास्तोष्पति is either (as in Rg. VIII. 17. 14) Indra or Rudra (as Durgā says). Thestinti is performed for averting all evil after entering a newly built house. 

12803.

he makes the house sānta (se follows). He deposits gold in water that has rice and barley thrown into it, he sprinkles the house three times going round it with his right side turned towards it with the santātiya hymn (Rg. VL. 35) and he does so again three times pouring out an unbroken stream of water with the three verses 'O waters! you are wholesome' (Rg. X. 9. 1-3). In the middle of the house he cooks boiled rice, offers from it four oblations with each of the four versos "Vastospate pratijānihyasmān' (Rg. VII. 54, 1-3 and VIL 55.1), should then prepare food, should feed the brāhmaṇas with it and make them say 'lucky is the house, lucky is the house.' Some details from Baud. Gr. (III. 5) may be mentioned here. It provides that oblations are offered from cooked food with the invitatory prayer (Puronuyakyā) Vāstospate pratijānihi' ('O Lord of houses ! accept us as your devotees,' (Rg. VII. 54. 1, Tai, S. II. 4. 10.1) and the offering prayer (Yājyā) with Vāstospate sagmaya' (O Lord of house9, may we be endowed with fellowship with thee &c. Rg. VII. 54. 3, Tai, S. III. 4. 10. 1). Then he offers āhutis of clarified butter with the mantras viz. Vāstospate dbruvā sthūṇā' (Rg. VIII, 17, 14), “gshyam bhayam yac-ced', 1282 'akṣispande-angacale,' 'duḥ-svapne pāpasvapne', 'Vastospate prataraṇo' (O Vāstospatil mayst thou be our saviour', Rg. VIL 54. 2),'amiyaha Vāstospate' (O VastospatiMayst thon be our friend destroying diseases' Rg. VII. 55.1). Then he places the remainder of the food from which offerings were made on bunches of darbhas in front of the Fire with the words 'salutation to Rudra Vāstospati! I offer (oblations to him) who protects when we approach, or run, walk out, depart, turn round or return.' Having brought together in a plate the water for cleansing the cooking vessel, the remainder of the clarified butter and the water (used in the rite) he sprinkles water therefrom on all sides with a twig of udumbara or palāśa or śami tree or with a handful of darbhas, be goes round the house thrice with his right side towards it with the verse 'tyam Vipraḥ' (Rg. IX. 18. 2). He preparos food, honours the brāhmaṇas (with food and fees), makes them recite blessings in the words 'lucky is the house, lusky is the house'. 

In the later digests the Vastuśānti is a very elaborate affair which is passed over here for reasons of space.

Various prognostications were based on the sounds produced by the house lizard (called palli, pallikā, kudyamatsyn or gphagodhika), by its movements and by its fall on the several limbs of a person by Vasantarāja sākuna, chap. 17 (32 yerses), the Adbhutasāgara pp. 666-568 (quoting 28 verses of Vasanta rāja), Jyotistattva pp. 706-707, śāntiratoa or Santi-kamalakara (folio 198), the Dharmasindhu (pp. 347–348). A few words based on the last two are set out here. A fall of the lizard on the right side of a male and on his head (except the chin), chest, navel and stomach is auspicious, while in the case of & woman such a fall would be auspicious on the left side. The bame applies to a chameleon. If a lizard or chameleon falls on a limb or creeps up a person's limb the person should take a bath with clothes on and perform a śānti for removal of the inauspi ciousness or for increase of auspiciousness. If a person has a mere contact with a house lizard or chameleon he should bathe, drink pañcagarya, look into clarified butter, should pay honour to (a golden image of the lizard or chameleon clothed in a red piece of cloth, offer to the image gandha and flowers, worship Rudra in a jar full of water, offer into fire 108 fuel sticks of khadira tree to the accompaniment of the Mștyunjaya 12824 mantra and offer 1008 or 108 āhutis of sesame into fire with the vyahrtis and perform the rites from scistaksi to sprinkling with drops of water and then donate gold, clothes and sesame. 12826 

The Yogayatrā chap. 7 (verses 1-12) and Hemadri on Vrata (vol. I pp. 894-897) mention ceremonial baths on and worship of nakṣatras from Asyin' to Revati and their presiding deities as yielding various benefits. The Atharvana-parisista I (called nakṣatrakalpa) sections 37-50 deal with nakṣatrasnāna from Kșttikā to Bharapi. Sections 37-41 contain the mantras employed in worshipping and placating the presiding deities of the nakṣatras beginning with Kșttikā. Section 42 describes the general procedure of nakṣatraspāna; sections 43-45 set out 

1282a. Mṛtyaõjaya maatra is the Tryamabaka mantra, according to Vidyākara quoted in Jyotistattva (p. 707). The Tryambaka mantra is 'Tryambakan yajāmabe' (Rg, VII. 59. 12, Tai. S. 1. 8. 6. 2, Vāj. S. III, 60). 

1282b. It is somewhat remarkable that Vasantarāja is entirely silent about the fall of the house lizard on a person's body and devotes thirty-two verses merely to the interpretation of the sounds of the lizard in different directions and at different times of the day and to the progaosticatlons deri ved from its movements on the walls. It is not unlikely that progaostication from the fall of the lizard on a man's limb was a later dovelopment.

the substances to be added to the water for each nakratrasnāna and the benefit to be derived from so doing. Sections 47-50 contain special roles in relation to each nakṣatra from Katika to Bharaṇī, about the distribution of food to brahmanag and gifts to be made on each nakṣatra together with the rewards to be expected therefrom. But the Bșhatsamhita chap. 47 (1-87), the Atharvapa-parisista V pp. 66-68, Viṣoudharmottara I, 103, Yogayātrā (VII. 13-21), the Kalikapurāpa chap. 89, end Hemādri (on Vrata vol. II, pp. 600-628) speak of a śānti called Puṣyagnana or Pusyābhiseka. It is said that Bphaspati par formed this śānti for Indra, then Vṛddha-Garga got it and he imparted it to Bhāguri. Most of the above works confine it to the king, since the king is the very root of the tree the subjects and since any harm to or welfare of that root (the king) results in misfortune or welfare of the people; therefore care must be taken for the increase of the king's Welfaro 17 As the treatment in the Bṭhatsamhita is the fullest and is among the most ancient descriptions, it is briefly set out here. The royal astrologer and family priest should perform the rite of Pasya spāna for the king, than which there is nothing more holy and nothing more destructive of all evil portents. This may be per formed on pusya-nakṣatra every time, but the Santi on this day when the Full Moon is in Pusya-pakṣatra is the highest and if such a sāna is performed without there being Pusya Daksatra on that day, then it yields only half the fruit. There is no utpūta which is not averted or mitigated by this śānti and there is no other auspicious rite which surpasses this. About Pasya the Ratnamālā 1284 states 'Just as the lion is the strongest among

Then Varāhamibira states in very poetio verses ( 47. 4–15) that the Puṣyasnāna of the king should be performed in a sylvan spot abounding in young and beautiful troes emitting fragrance and free from trees having thorns or troes like marking nut or from owls, vultures and the like or on rivers or on lakes or near lotus pools or near & cow-house or seashore or hermitages of sages, grand mangions resounding with the sweet cries of cuckoos and the like or near a holy shrine or tirtha or a spot beautified by parks. Then the astro loger, the councillors and officiating priests should go out from the capital at night and make an offering (bali) in the East, North or North-east and the royal family priest, being himself pure and bowing down, should invoke with fried grains, aksata, barley, curds and flowers and with a mantra 1285 the gods, the ( guardians of) quarters, the nūgas and brābmapas to be present at the spot and then say 'tomorrow you will receive worship and depart after conferring welfare on the king'. The family priest and the others should stay in order to find the auspicious nature or otherwise of the dreams (of the king). On the next day in the morning they should collect materials (for the Puṣyasnāna) on the spot chosen the previous day. He should draw a mandala (a diagram) there and should place thereon various jewels and should design places to nāgas, yaksas, gods, pitrs, gandharvas, apsarases, sages, siddhas, planets, nakṣatras, Rudras, the māts, Skanda, Viṣṇu, Visakha, Lokapālas, goddesses ( such as Lakṣmi, Gaurl, Indrāni), which sbould all be drawn with charming coloured powders or chalk &c, should offer them worship with sandal wood paste, flowers &c., with various edibles, fruits and meat, with drinks viz. wine, milk and decoctions; he should follow the procedure of Grahayajña and worship the various deities invited with appropriate foods, incense, clarified butter, flowers, with lauds and salutations &c. (verses 30–33). Then he should set up Agni on an altar to the west or south of the mandala drawn by him, should kindle it into flames and bring near it the materials and darbhas. He should offer worship on the altar to the west with fried grams, ghee, curds, honey, white mustard, fragrant substances, flowers, incenso, fruits, and should donate plates full of pāyasa and ghee. Then in the four inter

mediate quarters of the altar he should establish four jare the necks of which are surrounded with white thread and that are covered with leaves, twigs and fruits of trees having milky sap and filled with water mixed with herbs and materials for pusya gnāna and jewels. In versos 39-42 Varābamihira names about 15 plants the leaves 1286 of which are to be cast in the jan and also seeds and sarvanṣad his, sarvagandhas, bilva fruit &c. He ahould spread an old bull's hide with its zock to the east on the altar and thereon be should spread the reddish bide of a bull trained for fighting, the hides of a lion and a tiger ona over the other, when the Moon is in Puṣya-nakṣatra and there is an auspicious muharla Over the hides a throne raade of gold, silver, copper or of a tree with a milky sap should be placed. The king should occupy the throne after placing thereon a piece of gold, surrounded by his ministers, men of his confidence, the family priest, the astrologer, the citizens that have anspicious Damos (such or Jayarāja, Simharāja &c.). 

There should be loud noises (for drowning inauspicious Bounds) made by the bards and citizens and of the tabons and drums and of Vedic recitations. The king should wear linen and the purohita should cover the king with a blanket, drops should be sprinkled over the king from jars, 3, 28 or 108 in number, containing clarified butter, with two mantras 137 praising its power to remove evil and then the priest remove the blanket and sprinkles on the king drops of water from water containing the substances collected for puṣyasnāna with sixteen mantras 1200

Then, the king should take a bath and wear two cotton garments over which the three verses 'Apo hi ṣthā' (Rg. X 9. 1-3, Tai. S. IV. 1. 5. 1) and the four verses 'Hiranyavarṇāḥ'(Tai. S. V. 6.1.1-2, or Atharva I. 33. 1-4) have been inaudibly recited. He should sip water to the accompaniment of words like 'this is a lucky day and to the sound of conches, should worship gods, gurus, brāhmaṇas, his parasol, banner, and weapons and then worship his special (or favourite ) deity. Then he should put on new decorations that lead to victory, that confer long life and vigour and over which the Rāyaspoṣa 1290 (bestowing increase of wealth) ṣk verses have been recited. To the south of the mandala an altar should be prepared and hides of bull, cat, ruru deer, spotted antelope, lion and tiger should be arranged one over the other (tiger's being last) and the king should sit down on the hides. The purohita should offer in the fire in the principal place (to the south) offerings of fuel-sticks, sosame, ghee and the like to the accompaniment of șk verses addressed to Rudra, Indra, Bṛhaspati, Viṣṇu and Vāyu. The astrologer should observe and

declare the prognostioations derived 12004 from the flames of the sacred Agni as laid down in the chapter on the festival of Lodra's banner (Bṭ. S. 42. 31–36). Then the purohita with folded hands should pray 1991 "May all the groups of gods receive the worship from the king and depart after conferring (on him) abundant prosperity and returning ( when again in voked)'. Then the king should honour the astrologer and the purohita with plenty of wealth and (honour) according to their deserts also others, viz. men learned in the Veda and the like who are well worthy of receiving gifts. Then the king should assure safety to all subjects, ( order the) release of all animals taken to slaughter houses and release all persons put in jail except those guilty of offences against the king's person or his harem. Varāhamibira adds ( 47. 85) that this procedure of Puṣyasnāns is commended for a king who aspires after imperial dignity or who ardently desires a son or when he is first crowned king. He further states that this very procedure of ceremonial bath should be employed in the case of the king's elephants and horses that then become free from diseases (verse 87). 

A few remarks from other works may be added here. The Yoga-yatrā (chap. VII. 13-14) lays down 1292 that in the ceremonial bath clay should be collected from a mountain top, ant-hill, a river mouth, the two banks of a river, the foot of the Indra figure (in the Indradhyaja festival), (clay) dug up by the tusk of an elephant and by a bull's horn, (clay) from the royal palace-door and from the door of the house of a dancing girl (patronized by the king) and the king's head should be purified by rubbing on it the olay from a mountain top, his ears with

olay from an ant-hill, his sides with clay from the two banks of a river and from its confluonce with the sea, his neck with olay from the foot of the Indra figure, his arms with earth on the tip of the elephant's tusk and the bull's horns, his obest with earth from the door of the palace and his waist with clay from a royal courtezan's door. It will be noticed that there is a suggestive symbolism in all this. The king is to hold his head high and to atta in eminence; therefore his head is to be rubbed with clay from a mountain peak. 

It appears that nakṣatrasnāna was meant for all. For example, the Atharvana-parisista 1293 on nakṣatrakalpa (800. 43 p. 22) states that a Vaiśya should undergo coremonial bath on Robiṇi, being decked with all seeds, while verse 6 of the same section maintains that a brāhmaṇa who undergoes Pusyasnāna thrice with a thousand grains of red paddy and with a thousand mustard grains and with (twigs and leaves) of Sahasravirya, Ananti plants and with Madayanti and Priyangu plants acquires as much fame as a king. 

From the Matsya-purāṇa it is clear 1294 that Pusyasnāna was an item in Lakṣahoma, undertaken by the king to counter aot the evil effects of planets. That Purāṇa has a chapter ( 267, verses 3-4) on Dovatāsnāna 1295 where also provision is made for casting clay into the jar, clay being collected from the tusk of an elephant, from a horse (stable), public road, ant-hill, (clay ) dug up by a boar (with its tuak), from the shed where sacred fire is kept, from a tirtha (holy spot), cowpen and from the place where cows Crowd. 

The Viṣoudharmottara (II. 103. 1-10) provides that Bārhas patyasnāna (i. e. Puṣyasnāna, Brbaspati being the presiding deity of Pusya) should be performed in the bright half, in the

northern passage of the sun, on an auspicious day, pakṣatra and muhurta or when the moon is in Puṣya or Rohini nakṣatra or in Hasta or Śravaṇa; two square mandalas of eight cubits on each of four sides should be made, one for offering bali and the other for an altar on which a fire is to be established, both being decked with various things. Four jars with waters of springs should be placed in each of the two mandalas, and also seven jars filled with seeds, corn and precious stones, one for being decked with leaves of trees and the other with flowers and fruits. It appears (verses 12-13) that the Viṣṇudharmottara contemplates Pusyasnāna for the three higher varpas, 12% since it provides that a brāhmaṇa should sit on the hide of a bull as his seat, a kṣatriya may employ the hides of a lion and tiger and a vaisya on the hides of a tiger and leopard. It provides mantras other than those mentioned by Varāhamihira. It provides that this rite of Pusyasnāna should go on for seven days and that the person undergoing it should give up during those days wine, meat, honey and sexual intercourse (verse 29 ). This Puṣyasnāna drives away all ill-luck, destroys evil spirits, brightens the intellect, confers health, brilliance and fame, kills enemies, is auspicious, destroys sing and the evil effects of strife and bad dreams (versos 30-31). 

It should be borne in mind that a rite on Puṣya for pros perity called Pusya-vrata is mentioned by so early a work 88 the Apastambadharma-sūtra (for which p. 346 above may be referred to). 

In Bphadyogayātrā (chap. XIII. 1-10), Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 241. 1-14) and in Vasantarāja (chap. VI. 4. 1-14 pp. 87 92) a good deal is said about prognostications derived from the throbbing ( spandana or sphurana) of the several parts of a man's body. All the three often closely agree in words and ideas as the notes below will clearly show. There is hardly any doubt that Vasantarāja's treatment is based on the other two works. It is difficult to decide whether Varāhamihira borrows from the Matsya or vice versa or whether both borrow from a common source. It is not unlikely that Varāhamihira might

have followed the Mataya. They all agree that throbbing 1997 of the right side of the body is auspicious and of the left Induspl cious in the case of males, while the reverse is true in the case of women. They all set out the consequences indicated by the throbbing of the several parts and limbs of the body from the top of the head to the soles of the feet. To get out all these in detail would occupy much space. A few are mentioned by way of illustration. The fruit indicated by the throbbing of the top of the 129 head is the acquisition of land (or earth); of the forehead, the prosperity of the position already occupied; of the region between the eyebrows and nose, union with persons dear to one; of the region of the eye, death; of the portion near the eye the acquisition of wealth; of the upper arm, union with friends; of the hand, the acquisition of wealth; of the back, defeat; of the chest, success; of the upper part of the foot, the securing of a position; of the soles, journey with gain therein. The Matsya-purana 1299 prescribes that when inauspicious indica tions (by throbbing) occur, brahmanas should be placated with the gift of gold 

From ancient times the throbbing of the limbs, particularly of the arm and eye, have been regarded in India as the harbin gers of coming events, auspicious or inauspicious. Manu prohibits & sannyāsin ( parivrājake) from obtaining alms by means of declaring prognostications from utpātas or nimittas, from nakṣatras and from Angavidyā eto. In the Sākuntala

Throbbing of arms and eyes 

801 

Kalidasa twice mentions the throbbing of the arm of the hero ag indicative of good fortune and the throbbing of the right eye of Sakuntala as presaging 1300 misfortune. Shakespeare in “Othello" makes Desdemona speak about the itobing of her eyes as a bad omen. The Bṛhad-yogayātrā (XILL, 10), Bļ. 8. (51.10) and Vasantarāja declare that the throbbing of moles, boils, marks, eruptions (on limbs) are to be deemed to indicate consequences similar to the limbs on which they exist. 1301 

The Bșhatsamhita (chap 93 vorges 1-14), Bṛhadyogayātrā (chap. 21 verses 1303 1-21 ) and Yogayātrā (chap. 10 verses 1-15) dwell at length on the prognostications to be drawn from the arrangement of the tusks of elephants, from the marks geen when the tusks are cut, from the tired appearance and more ments of elephants, particularly when the king is to march on an invasion, since as the Yogayatrā says the king's victory depends on elephants.2303 These, however, do pot describe any śānti and are hence passed over hore as not relevant to the subject of sintis.

II. 62. 10), should cover two jars with a new piece of cloth with the Gāyatri, should close the mouths of the jars with some fruit (a cocoanut or the like) and keep the boiled food towards the west and place (the two jana) on a bunch of five dūryās. Then after the elephant stable la decked with wreaths of darbhas the elephant inhales the smell of the food offered in fire. He then makes ready a spoon of Asvattha wood and fuel and darbha grass. Then he goes through the items of ordinary homa 1304 from drawing lines onwards and offers oblations of the boiled food with ghee to the accompani mont of the Ghrtasūkta 1305 (Rg. VIII. 81. 1-9). Then the priest) offers 1008 additional āhutis with clarified butter with the five mantras beginning with 'namas-te Rudra manyaya (O Rudra I adoration to you that are fury incarnate' Tai. 8. IV, 5. 1. 1-5). Then the procedure from Sviṣtakrt offering to the gift of the cow (should be gone through). He puts down on bunches of dūrvā grass the remaining portion of the food from which offerings were made in front of the sacred Agni with the words 'svāhā to the bhūtas' (spirits). Then be (priest) makos (the elephant) eat what remains of the food cooked in the sthali (pan or cooking vessel) and the bunch of five dūryas ( on which the jars had been placed) to the accompaniment of the Ayusya sākta ; 1306 he sprinkles drops from the prapītā 1307 water with the

1305. It may be noted that the first verse of the Ghṭtasūkta is * T aifa ni T I FETET anatura is. Here the word a means 'great elephant' and also 'having long or big arms' (as applied to Indra ) and therefore is employed in the Gajasāati, following the principle mentioned in note 1276 above.

three verses beginning with 'apo hi sthi' (Rg. X 9.1-3, Tal. 8. IV.1.3.1-3) and the four verses beginning with 'Hiranyavarnih' (Tai, 8. V. 6.1.1-4), purifies (the elephant with water) to the accompaniment of the apuvāka beginning with 'payamanah suvarjanah' (Tai. Br. I. 4. 8. 1); he then leads the elephant to its place (stable); the elephant becomes long-lived; so says the adorable Baudhāyana." 

The Gajaśānti in Agnipurāṇa (chap. 291) is entirely differ ent from the above. One should worship on the 5th tithi of the bright half Viṣṇu, Lakṣmi, the Airāvata 1308 elephant and the other elephants (in all eight) and Brahmā, Śhaṅkara, Indra, Kubera, Yama, the Sun and the Moon, Varuna, Vāyu, Agni, the Karth and Akāśa. The elephants should be sprinkled with sāntyudaka (propitiatory water). The Agnipurāṇa proposes an elaborate worship, on a lotus-shaped diagram drawn on an altar, of several gods, several weapons, sages, rivers and mountains &c., elephants &o. and provides that an astrologer should ride the principal elephant of the king and say into its ear 'you are made the chief of elephants, the king will honour you with gandho, flowers, best food and people at the order of the king will honour you; you should protect the king in battle, in his journey and in his palace. You should forget that you are a more beast and revolve in your mind that you are divine !' &c. The king should then ride such an elephant and armed warriors should follow and various gifts should be made to the elephant keeper, the astrol oger, the scārya &o. 

The Viṣṇudharmottare (II. 50.1-93) is far more elaborate than even the Agnipurāṇa. Its verses about the words to be muttered in the ear of the elephant (II. 50. 59-64) are the same as those in the Agni (291, 15-20). The Viṣṇudharmottara adds (II. 50. 68-70) that this sānti should not be performed on the 4th 9th or 14th tithi nor on Tuesday nor on Saturday and the com mended nakṣatras are Jyeṣtha, Citra and Śravaṇa and that this bānti rite for elephants destroya all danger to elephants.

those verses occur in the Hastyāyurveda (Anandasrama ed.) chapters 35 and 36. Considerations of space and of importance prevent any desoription of that sānti derived from the Hasty ayurveda 

The Bṛhatsamhita (chap. 92. 1-14), the Bṛhadyogayātra ( 22. 1-21 ) and the Yogayātrā (XI, 1-14) deal with the movements, neighing, prancing, striking the ground with hoofs, postures of horses from which lucky or unlucky consequences are to be inferred. But they do not describe any śānti and therefore are passed over. The Agnipurāṇa (chap. 290, 1-8), the Viṣṇu dharmottara (II, 47. 1-42), Baud. gphysosasūtra 1 19 and Hemādri (on vrata, vol. II, pp. 1031-36 taken from Salihotra ) describe a śānti which aperts all dangers to horses and removes their diseases. 

The sānti from Baudhāyana is as follows:- "having carried out the usual details of an ordinary homa from drawing the lines onwards (the priest) offers into Agni oblations from the cooked food after reciting the puronuvākyā (invitatory prayer) 'tadaśvināśvayujopayātām' (May the Asyins that yoka horses come near, Tai. Br. III. 1. 2. 10) and the yājyā ( offering prayer) 'yau devānām bhisajau' ('that are physicians of the gods', Tai. Br. III. 1. 2. 11). Then he makes additional offerings with clarified butter szāhū to Aśvins, svāhā to the two that yoke horses, stāhā to the ear, svāhā to hearing' (Tai. Bṛ. III. 1. 6. 13). Then he performs all details from sviṣtakrt offering to the gift of a cow. Then he puts down on Aśvattha leaves in front of Agni the food remaining after the offering of cooked food with the mantra'yo aśvatthaḥ... ketubhiḥ saha'( Tai. Br. I. 2. 1. 8 9). He brings together in a plate the water with which the athalt is washed, the remainder of the clarified butter and of the water, sprinkles drops from it with an Aśvattha twig and goos round the horses thrice with his right towards the horses with the anuvāka beginning with 'yo yā aśv9sya medbyasya lomāni teda' (he who knows the hair of the holy horse). So said the adorable Baudhāyana." 

Sāntis are connected with sakunas also. The word sakuna means a bird' in the Roveda (IV. 26. 6, IX. 86. 13, IX. 96. 19 and 23, IX. 107. 20, IX. 11%. 2, X 68.7, X. 123. 6, X. 165. 2) and is & synonym of sakuni (Rg. II. 42. 1, II. 43, 2 and 3) and fakunti (Rg. II, 42, 3, II. 43. 1). In Rg. X. 16. 6 (yat te kropah sakuna ātutoda) the crow is referred to as the dark bird'. It has been seen above that birds like kapota were regarded even 

Sakunas 

805 

in the Rgveda as harbingers of impending evil and misfortune. Hence the word sakuna gradually came to mean premonition of evil Conveyed by cries, movements, positions of birds and then any prognosticatory siga (not necessarily connected with birds). There is an extensive literature on sakunas. Some of it is mentioned here, viz. the Matsyapurāṇa (chap. 237, 241, 243 ), Agnipurāṇa (chap. 230-232), Viṣṇudharmottarapurāṇa L 163 164, Padmapurāṇa (IV. 100.65–126), Bșhat-ramhita (chap. 85 95), Bṛhad-yogayātrā (chap. 23-27), Yogayātra (chap. 14), the Nimitta of Bhadrabāhu (ma. in Bhau Daji collection of BBRAS No. 385 in Prof. Volankar's Catalogue pp. 126-127), Vasantarāja sūkuna, 1309 Mānasollāsa of king Someśvara Cālukya ( 1126-1138 

1309. Vasantaraja's work on 'sakudas' was published by the Venkate. svara Press, Bombay (1906 A. D.), with the Sanskrit commentary of Bhānucandragani, who was patronized by Emperor Akbar (in the latter half of the 16th century A.D.) and a Hindi translation by Sridhar Jatasankara Bhatta. As Vasaataraja is quoted by Adbhuta-sāgara which was begun in saka 1089 (1167 A. D.), it follows that Vasantarāja would have to be placed before 1100 A. D. He is probably aot much earlier than 700 A. D. as he does not appear to have been mentioned by Utpala in his extensive commentaries on Varībamibira's works. Vasantarāja tells as (in the Introductory verses 3-5) that he was the son of Vijayarājabhatta and Sarasvati and the younger brother of Śivarāja, that he was honoured by king Candradeva (klag of Mithilā, acc. to the Com.) and composed the work on sakuda at the request of that king. He mentions (1. 10) Cūdāmaṇi, jyotina-Sastra, bora-astra and Svarodaya and (in I. 27) informs us that Atri, Garga, Goru, sutra, Vasiṣgha, Vyisa, Kautsa, Burgu and Gautama were the principal ancient sages that declared the knowledge of sakogas for the benefit (of human beings). Cūdāmagi is rather an early work quoted in the Sārāvali (5. 20 and 39, 8) of Kalyāṇavarman in the same breath with Varāhamibira, 

The Nimitta attributed to Bhadrababo is an extensive work contalaing 26 chapters and about 1460 verses. It is described in the colophon at the end as 'naigranthe (nairgranthe?) Bhadrabāhuke Nimitte svapoadbyāyah'. The first chapter states that in the time of king Senajit at Rajagrha in Magadba pupils asked Bhadrababu to expound to them the nimittas and ho did so, He is styled (in chap. II. 1) a digambara and the best of śramanas. The contents of chapters 2 to 26 are: Uikā (meteors), balo, lightning, avealng glow, clouds, winds and barricades, rain-fall, gandbarvanagara (Fata Morgana), narch of kings on invasion, portents affecting the king and the country due to the ripening of actions in former lives (chap. XIV bas 177 verses on this), grabacāra as declared by Jina (chap. XV, 227 verses), the prognosticatory movements of Venus, Saturn, Japiter, Mercary, Mars, Rabu, Ketu, the Sun and the Moon: grahayuddha; conjunctions of planets; dreams. It appears that the work is later thao Varāhamibita, As it is not within the pale of Dharmasastra Literature and hardly ever describes a saati in the way in which the Porānas and medieval dharmasastra works provide it has been referred to in this work only rarely,

A. D.) II, 13 pp. 102-112, Adbhutasagara (which profusely quotes Vasantarāja's work), Rājanitiprakasa (pp. 345-347). Among these Vasantarāja-śākuna is the most comprehensive work on the subject of sakunas and has been quoted by the Adbhutesāgara and other later works. A brief account of the work would not be out of place and is given here. It is divided into twenty vargas 1310 ( sections) and contains in different metres 1525 verses ( as stated in varga II. 12). It states; it would declare the sakunas 2311 indicated in this world by groups of beings viz. bipeds (mon and birds), quadrupeds (elephants, horses &c.), six-footed (bees), eight-footed (the mythical animal sarabba), beings having many foot (such as a scorpion) and having no feet ( such as snakes); that is called sakuna which is the means of arriving at definite knowledge about auspicious or inauspicious consequences viz. movement (to the left, to the right &c.), the sounds or cries (of birds and beasts), their glances and activities. A person who is an expert in sakuna bastra, knowing that a certain object of his would involve difficulties or would be without difficulties, abandons it or begins it respectively. The work boasts that if it be well studied it requires no expounder, no mathematics and that by merely studying it, the reader acquires pleasant knowledge that yields rewards. The work repeats the view of Varāhamihira (in Bșhat gamhitā 85.5 and on p.558 above in n. 827) that sakunas indicate to men, whether going on a journey or residing in their houses, how the consequences of actions done in past lives will certainly bear fruit. He answers the objection that, if no man can escape his fate and has to reap the rewards of his past actions, this bāstra is of no use, by saying that the actions of former lives bear fruit only at certain times and places and & man can avoid the rosults of past actions just as he avoids snakes, fire, poison,

The subjects in the 20 rargas and the verses allotted to each by Vasantarāja may be briefly set down at one place: 1. Sastrapratiṣtha (establishment of the sakupaśāstra by reasoning, verses 31); 2.

History of Dharmalastra [Sec. III, Oh.XXI 

A noticeable feature of Vasantarāja's work is that more than half of it (781 verses) is devoted to the sounds 1312 made by three birds viz Syama (400 Verses), crow (187) Pingalika (200) and that 312 verses are devoted to the barking, movements and howling of dogs (verses 222) and female jackals (verses 90 ). It is remarkable that among the Sāktas it is believed that a female jackal is a messenger of Kāli and is auspicious and on hearing its howl in the early morning a person should offer salutation and then success is in the hands of the sādhaka. The brief contents set out above will show that he extends the meaning of sakuna so as to include prognostications based on the sotions of men and beasts. He himself says at the end that 1313 is sakuna, which in this world is remembered, heard, touched or seen or which is declared in dreams, since they all yield resulta. He claims that the system of sakunag is as authoritative as the Vedas, smrtis and puranas, since it nover fails to convey correct knowledge. 1314 Some of his interesting statements may be briefly set out. If an owl hoot at night on the top of a house that portends 1315 sorrow and the death of the owner's son (VIII. 40). This is in line with modern popular belief in India. The cawing of crows is at the head of all prognosticatory sounds. The barking of dogs is the essence among all sakunas.' The Brhad-yogayatra. 1316 provides that certain animals and birds are useless for prognostications at certain seasons viz. the rohita (red) deer, horse, goat, ass, deer, oamel, hare, are useless in winter (siśira); Crow and cuckoo aro

How an ordinary man could distinguish between the sound 'cilicili ' (portending gains), cici (portending danger), ciriciri ( portending trouble ) and cikuciku (portending a wretched state) is difficult to say. Similarly, the Piśgalā bird is supposed to make five sounds viz. कि, किचि, किचिचि, किचिकिचि, किचिकिचिचि (वसन्तराज 13. 27-28) with different consequences.

Vasantarāja in IV. 47-48 pp. 56-57 has the same provisions almost word for word. Vasantaraja's work appears to have been based mainly on Varāhamihira's Bphat-samhitā section on sakuna, chapters 85 to 95 (321 versos ) in which Varābamihira devotes 47 verses in chap. 85 to the cries of birds in general, deals with the movements and barking of dogs (88. 1-20) and female jackals (89. 1-15), the cries of crows (62 verses in chap. 94), to horses (9%. 1-15), elephants (94. 1-14) and cows (90. 1-3). 

Vasantarāja states 1317 that there are five excellent ones in the matter of śakunas viz. the Podaki bird, dog, crow, pingalā. bird and the female jaokal. Sarasvati is the presiding deity of podaki, Yakṣa ( Kubera ) of dog, eagle of crow, Candi of pinga likā and the friend of Pārvati of the female jackal. He further says that all animals and birds are presided over by deitios; therefore a person who interprets sakunas should not kill them, as deities prosiding over them might become angry. His state ments about 'upaśruti' (oracular voices or words) are worth citing. 'At the time of pradosa or about the morning twilight when people are bardly speaking anything, a person that is ready to undertake any matter (business) should consider everywhere oracular voices. What a child says without being prompted to do so would not turn out to be untrue even at the end of a Yuga. No such easily understood and true sakuna exists for men other than upaśruti.' Both Mārasollasa (II 13, Versos 920-926 pp. 112-113) and Vasantarāja (VI pp. 78-80 Versos 5-12) describe a curious mode of divining the future called upaśruti: 1318 When all people are asleep and the publio ____1317. पोदकी भषणकाकपिङ्गला जमाकमियतमा च पशमी। एतदव सुनिसचमः सदा कोत्पते शकुनरत्नपञ्चकम् ॥ सरस्वती पाण्डषिकामधानां यक्षोपि यक्षं गश्च काकम्। चण्डी ga: font free farat forargrafierereito TST III. 3-4, pp. 22–23; Flat पुराणम्। याशिवाविवत शुत्वा शिवदूती शुभप्रदाम् । प्रणमेसाधको भूत्वा तस्य कामाः करे FUNT: \# *** (Jiv.

In front of that house they should cast white akṣata grains after (silently ) revolving in their mind their thoughts (the matter they are intent on). Then they should with concentrated mind listen. When they hear any words coming from inside of the house talked by a man, a woman or a child or any one else uttered at pleasure (or without restraint of any kind), auspicious, or inauspicious, they should consider the sense of the words heard and the conclusion drawn as to the future project from the words would not turn out to be untrue. The same method may be followed by approaching the house of a cāṇdāla.

Upstruki in Padmapurīna 

811 

A pocular mode akin to paśrati is described in the Padmapurana, Patalakhanda, chap 100 verses 65-166. It is narrated in that chapter that Bibhiṣans was put in chains by Dravidas when the fomer saw Śiva-liiga established by Rāma at Ramaśvara and when no one could explain how it happened, Rama questioned Sambhu himself who explained that the Puranas (mentioned in verses 51-53) may be employed as containing prognosticatory words. The procedure is that a maiden more than five years of age and less than ton years or any girl who has not attained puberty may be honoured with gandha, flowers, incense and other upacāras, she should be made to recite the words 'speak the troth, speak what is agrogable, O blessed Sarasvati! salutation to you, salutation to you!* Sha should be given three pairs of dūryā grass and she should be asked to cast them between two leaves of the book. The verse between two leaves would be indicative of sucoass in the under taking. The verse should be carefully considared and its meaning settled and applied to the matter in hand. This is like sortes sanctorum a sortes Vergilianae i d. divination by opening at random the Scriptures or a book of Virgil or by pricking the text with a pin. Then directions are given as to what should be done if the leaves are half burnt or indistinct &c. and it is said that one should look upon the verge as sent by fato like the words in the upaśruti method.1319 It is further stated that this method should not be resorted to every day, but rarely and that then one should worship the Purana the propious night and in the morning should consult the Purāṇa for sakuna (verses 114 116). The Skanda is the best among all Puranas for this purpose of śakuna; some hold that the Visgupurīga and the Ramayana also may be consulted, but the author of the Padma says that Viṣṇupurāṇa may not be used for this purpose, since if a man devoid of proper conduct honours it for consultation, then inauspicious indications come out (verses 122–125). Sambhu himself worshipped Skanda-puraṅa, asked the question why Bibhiṣana, devotee of Siya, had fetters put on him (verses 131 132). Then three verses were seen that gave indications (verses 133–135), two of which 1320 are cited below. At the end the

History of Dharmasāstra (sec. III, Ch. xxi 

Purāṇa says that the Adiparva of the Mahābhārata or all its partans may be employed for this purpose of sakung (Ver888 163–164). 

A similar method of finding out omens and of divination from the two works of the great Hindi poet and saint Tulasidas ( born in satinat 1589 i. e. 1532 A, D.) viz. Rāmājñā (or Rāma sakunāvali containing 343 doha verses ) and Rāmasalāka is described at some length by G. A. Grierson in I. A. VOL. XXII pp. 204 ff and in Festgabe E. Jacobi pp. 449-455. 

It is worthy of note that even scientific works like the Carakasamhitā ask the physician to notice the condition of the patient, of the messenger, and the actions of the physician and inauspicious omens. They are described in Indriyasthāna chap. 12. A fow notable verses may be cited here. That patient would only live for a month on whose head arises only powder ( dandruff or the like ) resembling the powder of dry cowdung and that slides down ( from the head); that patient will not live even for a fortnight whose chest dries up when he takes a bath and anoints his body with sandalwood paste while all other limbs are yet wet' (verse 12). "Those messengers from a patient who come to a physician when the latter is offering oblations into fire or is offering piṇdas to his pitrs, will kill the patient (i. e. indicate the approaching death of the patient, Verse 16 ); a woman who is in a pitiable state, terrified, hurried, troubled, dirty and unchaste, three persons ( coming together), deformed persons, impotent persons-these are messengers of those who are about to die' ( verses 21–22 ); a physioian should not go ( to see a patient) on being called by a messenger when the physician sees, while the messenger is describing the condi. tion of the patient, an inauspicious omon or a sorrowing man or a corpse or the decoration meant for the dead'; verses 67–70 dilate on the signs of an auspicious messenger and verses 71-79 set out auspicious omens such as the sight of curds, whole grains, brāhmaṇas, bulls, king, jewels, jar full of water, white borse &o. The physician is however advised not to declare an inauspicious omen even when he sees it that would give a shock or cause pain to the patient or even to anyone else ( verse 63 ).

Vedic santisīklas and maritras 

sts It would be of use to students of santis it the santi-sūktas of the Rsreds are mentioned in one place. They are: . 

(1) A do bhadrāḥ (Rg. L. 89. 1-10) (2) Svasti na Indro (Rg. 1. 89. 6-10) to) Sam na Indrāgni (Rg. VII. 35. 1-11 11321 (4) Yata Indra bhayāmahe (Rg. VIII, 61. 13-18) (5) Bhadram no api vātaya manaḥ (Rg. X. 20.1) (6) Āśuḥ śiśāno (Rg. X 103. 1-13) (7) Muācāmi tyā (Rg. X. 161. 1-5) (8) Tyam-ũ ṣu (Rg. X. 178. 1-3) (9) Mahi tiṇām ( Rg. X. 185. 1-3) 

(10) Rātri vyakhyat (Rg. X. 127.1-8) Most of the above hymns occur wholly or partly in the Atbarya veda, the Tai. 8. and other Vedic works. 

Then there are certain hymns that are called Raksoghna 322 (destroying evil spirits ) such as Kļṇusva pājah'(Rg. IV. 4 1-15), 'Raksobaṇam" (Rg. X. 87. 1-25), 'Indrasonā tapatam (Rg. VII, 104. 1-25), 'Agne hamsi nyatrinam' (Rg. X. 118. 1-9), 'Brahmaṇāgaih' (Rg. X. 162. 1-6). Some of these also occur wholly or partly in the Tai, S., Atharvaveda and other Vedic works. 

The eleven anuvākas of the Taittiriya Samhita IV, 5 beginning with the words 'namas-te Rudra manyava' are styled Rudradhyāya or simply Rudra. Reciting them once is styled 'āvartana', but the recitation of these eleven times is called 'Ekadasini'. Recitation of the Ekādasini eloven times is called in popular parlance Laghuradra, eleven repetitions tes of this

last are designated Mabārudra and eleven Mahārudras are called Atirudra The Rudra may take three forms viz. japa (muttering), homa (offering into Agni oblations to the accom paniment of the mantras), or abhiseka ( sprinkling a person with the holy water over which the mantras have been recited) For reciting Rudrādhyāya the yajamāna, if he cannot himself recite it, may employ one brāhmaṇa and also for Ekadasini; but for Laghurudra and Mahārudra elevon brahmapas are generally employed and for Atirudra eleven or 121. Ekadasini and Laghurudra are very much in vogue avon now in Maharāṣtra. Rudrābhiseka is described in Baud. gphyaśeṣasūtra IL 18. 11-16. 

The mantra Tryambakam yajāmabe'(Rg. VII. 59. 12, Tai. S. L 8. 6. 2, Vāj. S. III, 60) is called Mștyunjaya. Japa of it is prescribed for relief against premature death. The Baudhāyana gļhyaśeṣasūtra (III. 11) prescribes & somewhat more elaborate rite and provides that the mantras to be recited are apaitu mṛtyuh'(Tai. Br. III. 7. 14. 4), 'param mptyo' (Tai. Br. III. 7, 14.5), 'mā no mahāntam' (Rg. I. 114. 7), 'mā nas-toke' (Tai. 8. TIL. 4. 11. 2), 'Tryambakam yajāmahe' (Tai. S. I. 8.6.2), 'Yo te sahasram' (Tai. Br. III. 10. 8. 2). 

It is unnecessary for the author to say what should be done in these days as to śāntis. Most of the sāntis except a few, as pointed out above in various places, are no longer performed. Even the few that are yet performed may coase altogether in the near future, if one is to judge from modern trends.
