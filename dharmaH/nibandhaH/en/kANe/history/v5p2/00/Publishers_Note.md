PUBLISHER'S NOTE 

It is with a sense of profound gratification that the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute presents to the public the second part of the fifth and last volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra by MM. Professor Dr. P. V. Kane, National Professor of Indology. With this part, this monumental literary project, which was conceived by the author more than thirty years ago, has been brought to a successful completion. This must, indeed, be regarded as a memorable event in the history of Indological studies and research in this country. The five volumes of the History of Dharmaśāstra together extend over nearly 6,500 pages, and constitute an authoritative and encyclopa:dic treatment of the religious and civil law of ancient and medieval India. And what is particularly remarkable is that Professor Kane has accomplished this enormous work single-handed, and that too while being fully occupied with various other literary and public activities. 

For Professor Kane, the Ilistory of Dharmaśāstra is the crowning glory of a life of great fulfilment; and, for the Institute, it is a matter of pride and honour to be so closely associated with it. 

Professor Kane is now eighty-two years.of age, but his energy and enthusiasm by no means seem to be on the wane For, he has agreed ( health permitting ) to prepare for the Insti tute a revised and enlarged edition of the first volume of the History, which has now almost gone out of print.
