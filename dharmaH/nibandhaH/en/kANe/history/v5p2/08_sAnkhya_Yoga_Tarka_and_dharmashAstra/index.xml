      <description>&lt;p&gt;SECTION VIII Relation of Sāikhya, Yoga and Tarka to Dharmaśāstra&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXXI Dharmaśāstra and Saṅkhya.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sāokhya is one of the well-known six yarārenns (philoso phical points of view).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saṅkarācārya in his bhagya 2208 on V. S. II. 2. 17 says that Manu and others who were deeply versed in the Veda took up to some extent in their works the doctrine of pralhūna being the cause of the world with the idea of relying on that part of its doctrine viz. the effect is (already) existent in the cause. Similarly, on V, S. I. 4.38 he says that great effort was made by the Sūtrakāra and himself for refuting the doctrines of the Sāṅkhya system (and not for the refutation of the theory of atoms being the cause of the world), since the Sāṅkhya system is near to the Vedānta as it accepts the view of the non-diffor. ence of cause and effect and as some Dharmasūtra writers like Dovala have had resort to it in their works. On V. S. II. 1. 3 Saṅkarācārya remarks that, though there are many smrtis dealing with metaphysical topics, great effort was made for the refutation of Saṅkhya and Yoga only, since the two systems are well-known in the world as means of securing the highest goal of man, as they have been accepted by śistas (respectable and learned people) and are supported by Vedic indications in their favour (as in svetāśvatara Up. &amp;rsquo;tat-kāraṇam sānkhyayogabhi pannam&amp;rsquo; VI. 13). It would be shown later on that Manu and Devala rely on and propound ( somo) Sāṅkhya doctrines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXXII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yoga and Dharmaśāstra&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saṅkhya and Yoga often go together in the Upaniṣads 28 well as in the Mahābhārata, the Bhagavadgitā and the Purāṇas and their relationship to one another is the same in all these. In Sv. Up. VI. 13, Vanaparva 2.15, śāntiparva 2270 228, 28, 289.1, 306. 65, 308, 25, 326. 100, 336. 69, Anuśāsana 14, 323, Bhagavad gitā V. 4-5, Padma purāpa (Pātālakbanda, 85. 11 ff), the two are mentioned together,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;CHAPTER XXXIII&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tarka and Dharmaśāstra&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Yāñavalkyasmrti (I. 3) mentions Nyāya (logic )2409 ag one of the fourteen vidyās and as one of the means of knowing what Dharma is. Nyāya is rendered as &amp;rsquo;tarkavidyā&amp;rsquo; by the Mitākṣarā on Yāj. and the Mit. states that the fourteon vidyās are the hetu (moans) of ( knowing) dharma,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both the Nyāyasūtra and the Vaiśeṣikasūtra of Kanāda postulate that &amp;rsquo;nihśreyasa&amp;rsquo; follows from the correct knowledge of the categories of the two darśanas, 2410&lt;/p&gt;</description>
