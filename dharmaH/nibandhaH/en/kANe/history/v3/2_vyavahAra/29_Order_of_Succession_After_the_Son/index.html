ORDER OF SUCCESSION AFTER THE SON
It has been stated above that daya is either apratibandha or sapratibandha and that sons, grandsons and great-grandsons take the first kind of daya. If a man has no son either aurasa or secondary (viz. the dattaka, the other kinds of sons being now forbidden or obsolete), then his property devolvos in a certain order. When a man dies sonless and is a member of a joint Hindu family then on the surviving coparceners the whole estate devolves except that after 1937 (by Act XVIII of 1937) his widow takes his place as to the joint family property. But if he dies separated and has male issue (from whom also he is separate ) then his male issue will succeed to him in a body viz. his son, grandson (son of a predeceased son) and great grandson (son of a predeceased son’s predeceased son) will together take his separate property per stirpes. From Manu IX. 137 ( which is the same as Vas. 17.5 and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 15. 46 ) and 186 and Yaj. I 78 it follows that the son, grandson and great grandson equally confer great spiritual benefit and so are the principal group of heirs. According to the strict theory of the Mitakṣarā as stated above, son, grandson and great-grandson take by birth an interest even in property acquired by a man him self, but they have no power to prevent him from alienating it. If one or more out of a man’s sons, grand-sons or great-grandsons are separate from him then on his death his self-acquired property will first be taken by those sons, grandsons and great grandsons that are joint with him and if none of these is joint. with him, the separated son, grandson and great-grandson will Bucceed per stirpes to his estate, 1339">

  <p>CHAPTER XXIX</p>
<p>ORDER OF SUCCESSION AFTER THE SON</p>
<p>It has been stated above that daya is either apratibandha or sapratibandha and that sons, grandsons and great-grandsons take the first kind of daya. If a man has no son either aurasa or secondary (viz. the dattaka, the other kinds of sons being now forbidden or obsolete), then his property devolvos in a certain order. When a man dies sonless and is a member of a joint Hindu family then on the surviving coparceners the whole estate devolves except that after 1937 (by Act XVIII of 1937) his widow takes his place as to the joint family property. But if he dies separated and has male issue (from whom also he is separate ) then his male issue will succeed to him in a body viz. his son, grandson (son of a predeceased son) and great grandson (son of a predeceased son&rsquo;s predeceased son) will together take his separate property per stirpes. From Manu IX. 137 ( which is the same as Vas. 17.5 and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 15. 46 ) and 186 and Yaj. I 78 it follows that the son, grandson and great grandson equally confer great spiritual benefit and so are the principal group of heirs. According to the strict theory of the Mitakṣarā as stated above, son, grandson and great-grandson take by birth an interest even in property acquired by a man him self, but they have no power to prevent him from alienating it. If one or more out of a man&rsquo;s sons, grand-sons or great-grandsons are separate from him then on his death his self-acquired property will first be taken by those sons, grandsons and great grandsons that are joint with him and if none of these is joint. with him, the separated son, grandson and great-grandson will Bucceed per stirpes to his estate, 1339</p>
<p>This view is at least as old as the Baud. 1340 Dh. 8. 1. 5. 113 115 which speak of the three ascendants of a man, of himself,</p>

<p>Succession to male dying sonless</p>
<p>701</p>
<p>of his full brothers and of his son, grandson and great-grand son from a bavarṇa wife as one group called avibhakta-daya sapindas and that in the absence of these only, the wealth of a man goes to his sakulyas.</p>
<p>On the succession to the property of a man dying without male issue (i. 8. without son, grandson or great-grandson) the basic texts are two verses of Yājñavalkya 141 (II. 135-136 ): &lsquo;The lawfully wedded wife, the daughters and the daughter&rsquo;s son), the parents, the brothers, their sons, gotrajas (agnatic kingmen), bandhu (cognatic relation), a pupil, a fellow student-on failure of each preceding one out of these each succeeding one is entitled to take the wealth of a man who is dead ( lit. who has gone to heaven) and who leaves no male issue. This rule applies to all varṇas&rsquo;, The Viṣṇu Dh. . (17. 4-15) is almost to the same effect. The word &rsquo; aputrasya&rsquo; in Yāj. is taken to mean one having no son, grandson or great-grandson (at the time of death ) by V. C., Raghunandana and Mitramiśra 1343. The Mit. explains the words&rsquo; to all varpas&rsquo; as applying even to all that are the offspring of anuloma or pratiloma unions.</p>
<p>We have separate rules for inheritance to the property of males and to that of females. Then there is great difference as to the rights of women as heirs. First, inheritance to the property of males will be taken up. Here again the fundamental principles are different aco, to the Mit. and the Dayabhāga..</p>
<p>Among the heirs (apart from male issue) of a man as regards his separate property the first is the widow. The wife&rsquo;s right to succeed to her deceased husband&rsquo;s estate, when he died separated and un-reunited, was acknowledged only after a long struggle extending over centuries. The passage of the Tal. 8. VI. 5. 8. 2 speaking of women as &lsquo;adayādih&rsquo; has already</p>

<p>been quoted (on p.606). The meaning of that word is somewhat dubious, as will be shown later on. The Āp. Dh. 8. II. 6. 14. 2 states generally 1343 that in default of a son the nearest sapinda succeeds but does not expressly mention the wife as an heir, though it mentions ( in 11. 6. 14. 4) the daughter as a possible Hotr. Baud. also omits the wife as an heir. Vas. mentions no woman as heir. Gaut. 28. 19 appears to state that the wealth of one who dies without issue should be taken by his sapiṇdas, sagotras and sapravaras or his wife (i. e. according to Haradatta, the wife takes a share only along with the nearest sapinda or gagotra and not exclusively ). Haradatta himself was of this view. Manu does not declare that the wife is the heir of a sonless man and there are certain passages wbich impliedly exclude her, as 6. 8. Manu IX, 185 ( the father takes the wealth of a map dying sonlegs or his brothers take it ), IX, 217 (the mother should take the woalth of a sonless man). Saṅkha (q. by the Mit., Dayabhaga XI. 1. 15 ) prescribes that the wealth of a man dying without issue goes to his brothers, failing them the parents take it or the eldest wife. 1344 Devala (q. by the Dayabhaga XI. 1. 17-18 and V. R. p. 593 ) arranges the heirs in order as full brothers, daughters, father, half brothers, mother and wife. It may be noticed that in the days of Kalidasa the sonless widow did not succeed to the wealth of her deceased husband, but was only entitled to maintenance and that the estate escheated to the king. This is clear from the letter written by the minister to king Dugyanta about the wealth of a merchant who perished in a ship-wrook (.ACT VI). Yāj. and Vispu among empti writers were probably the first to clearly enunciate the rule that the wife was the foremost heir of a man dying without male issue. Br. makes the wife the first heir of a sonless man and supports his</p>

<p>opinion with reasons. He says : 1345 &lsquo;In the Voda and in the doctrines of the smrtis and in popular usage the wife is declared to be half the body of the husband, equally sharing the consegu ences of good and evil acts. Of him whose wife is not dead half the body survives. How can another obtain the property, while half the body (of the deceased ) lives? Although kinsmen, although his father, mother or his relatives may be alive, the wife of a man dying without issue succeeds to his share, A wife dying before her husband takes away his sacred fires (i. e. she is cremated with the sacred Vedic fires, if he be an Agnihotrin); but when the husband dies before the wife, she takes his property, if she be chaste&rsquo;. Even when Yaj. proclaim ed the paramount right of succession in the case of widows there were other smrtis and some early commentators who dia not subscribe to that view. Nār. ( dāyabhāga, 25-26 ) provides that if among several brothers one who is childless dies or becomes an ascetic the others should divide the property except ing stridhana, that they should make provision for his women till their death in case they remain faithful but if they are otherwise (i..e. unfaithful) they may cut off the allowance: Nār. (dāyabhāga, 50-51 ) provides that on failure of sons, the daughter, sakulyas, bandhus, a man of the same caste, the king succeed in order and thus omits the wife altogether. Vyāsa 1346 ( quoted by Haradatta on Gaut. 28.19 and by Sm. O. II. p. 281 ) holds that a wife may take the whole of the husband&rsquo;s property if it does not exceed 2000 paṇas in value. The Mit. tells us that Srikara espoused this position that the wife takes the</p>

<p>1347a. Jai. VII. 3. 19-25 as understood by the Mit, may be briefly explaised as follows: The Cāturmāsyas (seasonal sacrifices) are four, Vaiśvadeva, Varuṇapraghāsa, Sākamedba, Supāsiriya (vide H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 1091-1105 for description). In regard to these the following texts occur in tho Veda and are cited by Sabara and others : re: soranitesi</p>

An uttaravedi (vide H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 1096–1097 for description ) is not required in Darsapūrgamāsa, but it is required in a Soma sacrifice. The cāturmāsyas are modifications (vikrti) of the Darsapūrga māsa, so that whatever is prescribed in the latter follows in the absence of express directions as a matter of course in the formerIn the texts quoted above the words &lsquo;dvayoḥ pranayanti&rsquo; lay down a vidhi and the words</p>

The purvapakṣa argues ; As cāturmāsyas aro modifications of Darśapūrnamāsa, it is unnecessary to lay down axprosaly a simple pranayana io them; therefore, the prapayana prescribed in dvayoḥ pranayapti&rsquo; must be the pranayana as described in a Soms sacrifice. Further the prohibition of an uttaravedi in Vaisvaveda and Supisiriya indicates the same, since a prohibition implies tbat there was a faar that what is prohibited would bave otherwise followed and since an</p>

<p>Views about wife as heir</p>
<p>705</p>
<p>by the Smṛtigangraha and Dhāro vara, viz. that the wife would</p>
<p>(Continued from the last page) uttaravedi is required only in a Soma sacrifice. Therefore the pranayana prescribed in dvayoḥ pranayanti&rsquo; is of the Somapranayana type. To this a partisan of the siddhāntin (siddhaotaikadesin) replies as follows:&mdash;The real view is that in dvayoḥ pranayanti the prapayana is of the simple darśa pūraamāsa type and the prohibition about Vaiśvadeva and Sunāsiriya is not to be explained as you do; in the words &lsquo;upātra vapanti&rsquo; an uttaravedi is generally (without exception) prescribed for all cāturmāsyas, but in the following two sentences &rsquo;na vaiśvadeve &amp;c.&rsquo; the preparation of uttaravedi is forbidden in the case of Vaisvadeva and Sunāsiriya ; therefore the partisan says that the idea is that, though the pranayana is of the simple darśapūrna māsa type, yet an uttaravedi is prepared in the 2nd and 3rd but not in the first and fourth of the cāturmāsyas. The pūrvapaksin retorts that even on this construction vidhivaiṣamya would still be tliere as follows: as there is prescription of uttaravedi in all four and prohibition in two (viz, the first and fourth of the four cāturmāsyas), there is an option of uttaravedi in these latter two (as the rule is &rsquo;tulyabala-virodhe vikalpaḥ&rsquo;) and there is no option as to the other two and there will arise the fault of vidhivaiṣanya, the same sentence viz. &lsquo;upātra vapanti&rsquo; being taken as an unqualified and independent rule about the 2nd and 3rd of the cāturmāsyas and taken as an optional rule as to the Ist and 4th.</p>
<p>The proper siddhanta view is as follows: Though the words &lsquo;dvayol pranayanti&rsquo; are very general, they are to be narrowed down so as to refer to only two (viz. 2nd and 3rd of the cāturmāsyas) on account of the recom mendatory passage that follows ( speaking of Varunapragbasa and Sākamedha as the thighs of cāturmāsya yajña). The vidhi and the following arthavada form one syntactical whole (ekavākya), as laid down by Jai, 1. 2. 7. The arthavāda passage means that just as a man marches on in strength if his thighs are strong, so the cāturmāsya sacrifice reaches a successful close by means of Varunapragbāsa and Sākamedha in which an uttarvedi is specially prepared and fire is laid thereon (being taken from the āhavaniya fire by the adhvaryu and pratiprasthātr). Therefore the meaning is that there is prana yana in the 2nd and 3rd out of the four cāturmāsyas and uttaravedi is pres cribed in those two alone and the words &rsquo;there is no uttaravedi in Vaisva deva and Sunāsiriya&rsquo; are a mere anuvada (repetition of what is already known) and not a probibition, as in the words &lsquo;fire should be kindled on the carth and not in the sky nor in heaven&rsquo;. On this interpretation there is no vidhivaisamya. Sabara makes two adhikaranas of Jai, VII. 3. 19-25, while Kumārila makes one adhikarana of these seven sutras, He further differs as to the siddbāate, which, according to him, is that in dvayoh pranayanti&rsquo; there is a special (apūrva) kind of pranayana prescribed, prākrta (of darśapūrnamāsa type) and saumika pranayana being the two other views which he rejects. The Subodhini on the Mit. very lucidly explains this discussion and concludes: यथा सकदेशिमते विधिवैषम्य दोषस्तथा</p>

<p>take the estate of her sonless deceased husband if she submitted to niyoga and procured a son for the husband.

<p>The Mit. after an elaborate statement and refutation of the views of Srikara, Dhāreśvara and others due to the conflict among smrti texts on the question of the widow&rsquo;s right of succession, establishes the proposition that the widow, if chaste, is entitled to the whole of her deceased sonless husband&rsquo;s wealth, 1350 Almost all writers since the time of the Mit. accept the widow&rsquo;s right to succeed to her husband&rsquo;s wealth. Many writers note that the smrti texts on the heirship of the widow are in conflict. 1351 They explain verses like those of Nar. (dayabhaga 25-26) providing only maintenance for women either as</p>

<p>Widow as heir</p>

<p>referring to exolusively kept concubines of the deceased or to the wives of re-united coparceners.</p>
<p>Patni means a woman wbo is married to the deceased, the word being formed from. &lsquo;pati&rsquo; with an affix in the genge of &lsquo;being fit to join with the husband in the performance of sacri fice&rsquo; (Pāṇini IV. 1. 33). The Sm. C. II. p. 290 quotes a Verge that a woman who is procured for sexual intercourse in exchange for money is only a dāsi and is not a patni and therefore is not entitled to inherit to a sonless paramour. 1352 The Baud. Dh. S. 1. 11. 20 quotes a similar verse. Several texts require that the widow must be chaste before she can claim the inheritance of the deceased. A text attributed to Vṛddha Manu 1353 says, &lsquo;The wife alone, being sonless and keeping the bed of her lord unsullied and leading a life of religious obger vances, may offer pinda to her deceased husband and take his entire estate&rsquo;. Kāt. ( 926 ) also declares that &rsquo;the wife who is chaste takes the wealth of her husband&rsquo;. The widow must be chaste at the time the inheritance opens. The courts have held that once the husband&rsquo;s estate is Tested in the widow, it will not be divested or forfeited by reason of unchastity subsequent to the death of the husband. 1354 If the widow remarries after inheriting, then, though the remarriage of a widow is legalized by the Hindu Widows&rsquo; Remarriage Act.(XV of 1856 ), she forfeits the estate of the husband taken by her or the estate which she took as a widowed mother of her deceased son and it passes to the other heirs of the husband or son as if she were then dead and this applies to widows of all castes according to almost all High Courts ( even when remarriage</p>

<p>According to the Dayabhāga there being no apratibandha daya, the widow of a sonless member even in a joint family succeeds to his share in the family property and there is no difference between joint family property and separate property.</p>
<p>In the case of sūdras, if the owner dies leaving a widow or a daughter or a daughter&rsquo;s son and an illegitimate son, it has been held by the courts following Yaj.

<p>Characteristics of widow&rsquo;s estate</p>
<p>709</p>
<p>husband&rsquo;s estate (by gift, sale &amp;c.). Br. 1538 (S. B. E. vol. 33 pp. 377-78 verses 50-51 and 53 ) states : &lsquo;when the husband is separate his widow takes all his various kinds of property such as a pledge, except immovable property. After having received movable and immovable property, gold, inferior metals, grain, liquids and clothes the widow shall cause (her husband&rsquo;s) monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas to be performed. Let her honour with funeral offerings and pious charity her husband&rsquo;s paternal uncle, gurus ( elders ), daughter&rsquo;s son, sister&rsquo;s son and maternal uncle as also aged or helpless persons, guests and women&rsquo;. Mādhava (Par. M. III. p. 536 ) explains that &rsquo;except immovable property&rsquo; means that she is prohibited from making a sale of immovable property without the consent of the male kinsmen. The V. Mayūkha (p. 138 ) accepts this interpretation and modern courts have done the same. In Damodardas v. Purmanandas y Bom. 155 it was held that a widow to whom movable property was bequeathed by the will of her husband takes it absolutely. But here the movable property was not inherited by her and as it was a bequest by will it became her stridhana according to Nār. ( q. by V. M. on p. 155 ). Besides, this was a cage from Bombay Island and was governed by the law of V. Mayūkha. In some early cases in Bombay it had been held that a widow in Western India under the Mitākṣarā had absolute power over the movable property inherited by her from her husband. In Gadadhar 1. Chandrabhagabai 17 Bom. 690 (F. B.) it was held that under the law of the Mitākṣarā a widow has no power to bequeath move able property inherited by her from her husband and that to that extent the decision in Damodar v. Purmanandas must be treated as of no authority if it be interpreted to have decided the point in that way. In Sha Chamanlal v. Doshi Ganesh 28 Bom, 453 it was decided that even under the Mayūkha a widow inheriting movable property from her husband has no</p>

<p>power to dispose of it by will. Lastly in Pandharinath v. Govind 32 Bom. 59 it was held, after an elaborate examination of authorities, that a widow is not under the Mitakṣarā competent to make a gift of the movables inherited by her from her husband and it was said (on p.75 ) that possibly with the spread of education amongst, and the general emancipa. tion of, their women Hindus may be led to call in aid the relief of Legislature. In cases arising under the Mayūkha &amp; widow may dispose of movable property inherited by her from her husband by gift inter vivos but not by will. Kat. 1359 (921, 924-925) propounds the limitations of the widow&rsquo;s rights as follows: &rsquo; A sonless widow, preserving the bed of her husband (unsullied) and residing with her elders and being self-controlled, should enjoy (her husband&rsquo;s property ) till her death; after her the (other) heirs (of the husband) would get it. A wife who preserves ( the honour of) the family would get the share of her husband when he is dead till her death, but she has no power to make a gift, sale or mortgage. A widow engrossed in religious observances and fasts, fixed in the vow of celibacy, always intent on restraining her senses and making gifts goos to heaven oven though sonless&rsquo;, 1360 These verses show that the widow was to enjoy the income of her husband&rsquo;s property till her death; that she could not sell or mortgage or give away immovable property without the consent of the heirs that would come after her and that for religious and charitable purposes or those that conduce to the spiritual welfare of her husband a widow had large powers of disposition.

<p>Limitations on widow&rsquo;s estate</p>
<p>have been accepted by modern decisions; vide Collector of Masulipatam v. Cavaly Vencatu 8 Moo. I. A. 500 at p. 551 for an oftquoted pagsage about the widow&rsquo;s powers of disposal. There is a large volume of case law on the widow&rsquo;s powers of aliena tion, on what are religious and charitable purposes and about the consent of the kinsmen, which have to be passed over here. The heir or heirs expectant on the death of a widow are called reversioners or reversionary heirs in the decided cases. There is no exact Sanskrit word to convey the same idea except * dāyāda&rsquo; that occurs in Kāt. quoted above and in D. B., which makes it clear that the reversioners take the estate after the widow&rsquo;s estate ends ( by death, remarriage, surrender &amp;c.). The doctrine of the surrender by the widow of her estate in favour of the next heirs (the reversioners ) whose estate is said to be accelerated is based on meagre foundations viz. the words of Kat, and the D. B. quoted in n. 1359. Judicial decisions, how over, have raised a stupendous structure on these slight founda tions ; but they are passed over here.</p>
<p>If a man dies leaving several widows then they may partition the property equally among themselves, as stated by the Mit. 1361</p>
<p>If after partitioning among themselves, one of the widows dies, the portion given to her comes to the other widow or widows i, e, there is survivorship among them and no one else can succeed to the husband&rsquo;s property as long as there is any widow alive and not remarried. Hindu Law does not favour the distribution of a deceased man&rsquo;s estate among his several relatives, as some other systems (like that of the Moslems) do. It gives the whole estate to one heir or one class of heirs to the exclusion of all others. It is greatly to the credit of the ancient Hindu Law that it boldly gave all the separate property of a deceased male to women, viz. to the widow and after her to the daughter in preference to the man&rsquo;s own father or brother or nephew. Attempts are now being made through the Legislature that even when there are sons, the widow and daughters of the deceased should be given shares. Though these efforts spring from the laudable motive of en larging the rights of women, they do not deserve unqualified encouragement. They will produce friotion, cause fragmenta</p>

<p>The words of the Tai S. quoted above (p. 606 ) about women being without strength and not entitled to dāya (adāyādih) really occur in the ritual of Soma offerings and should mean that women are not allowed to share in the drinking of Soma. But the Baud, Dh. S. (8. B. E. vol. 14 p. 231 ) appears to have taken them as excluding women from inheritance. Manu IX. 18 also relies on it and declares that the samskūras on women (except marriage) are not to be performed with Vedic mantras, as the Veda declares them to be &rsquo;nirindriya&rsquo; and &lsquo;anta&rsquo;. Later writers like Haradatta (on Gaut. 28. 19, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 14. 1) and V. P. pp. 517 and 554 base the exclusion of women from inheritance on this passage of the Veda. They say that, though the Vedic text is very sweeping and general, it is meant to oxclude only women other than those expressly mentioned in the smrtis as entitled to inherit. For example, the Dāyabhāga XI. 6. 11 quotes Baud. and remarks that the wife is entitled to inherit because of special texts (like those of Yāj. and Vispu) in her favour, The Sm, C. II. p. 294 1363 says that the Vedic passage is only an arthavāda (meant for praise ) and not an absolute rule and it must be taken as not referring to those women that are expressly mentioned (lit. by being seized by the horn). The V. P. says the same. Aparārka (p. 743 ) holds that the Vedic passage is merely an anuvada and excludes women only when there is a son. It should be noted that the Par. M. (II. p. 536) holds that the Tai. S. passage merely means that the wife of the sacrificer is not entitled to partake of Soma</p>

VI. 5. 8. 2 and explains it somewhat differently 88 meaning that women being without strength do not take the heritage when there are children. It is very remarkable that both the Mit. and the V. Mayūkha do not at all refer to the Tai. 8. or Baud. Dh. 8. in speaking of the rights of women to inheritance. It cannot be said that they were unaware of them, but probably they took the Tai. S, text in the sense in which the Par. M. explains it. The result of the reliance on the Tai. S. and on Baud. by most medieval digests has been that in the whole of India except in the Madras and Bombay provinces only five females are recognized as heirs viz. the widow, the daughter, the mother, the father&rsquo;s mother and paternal grand-father&rsquo;s mother, because they were expressly mentioned as heirs in the smftis or early commentaries.

<dt>• The right of the wife to maintenance during her husband&rsquo;s life time has already been dealt with in H. of Dh. II. pp. 568-569. If the wife was guilty of unchastity but repented of her lapse, she was still entitled to be maintained by the husband ( vide H. of Dh. II. pp. 571-573 ). As regards the rights of mainten ance of the widows of deceased members of a joint Hindu family there is a good deal of case law which is passed over here. One or two points may be noted. The right of the widows in a joint Hindu family are conditional upon their leading a life of chastity. Male members are often unwilling to maintain widows who are often compelled to go to court. In the &lsquo;Selections from Peshwa Daftar&rsquo;, vol. 43, there is an order ( letter No. 14% ).of Rāmagāstri, the chief justice of the Peshwa&rsquo;s court, calling upon one Bapuji Tambavekar under threat of penalties to restore the ornaments of the widow of his elder brother (that had died only seven days after marriage ) and to give her yearly maintenance of Rs. 125.</dt>

<p>History of Dharmasastra - I Vol. struggle hard for recognition as hoir just as the widow had. Gaut., Baud. and Vas. omit the daughter as an heir. Āp. Dh. 8. II. 6. 143 recognizes the daughter as an optional hotr (probably with sapindas). When Manu IX, 130 declares, &lsquo;one&rsquo;s Bon is like one&rsquo;s self and one&rsquo;s daughter is equal to one&rsquo;s son ; how can another person take the wealth of the deceased) when she who is the very self (of the deceased) lives&rsquo;, it appears from the context (IX. 128-129) that it is the pritrika ( the daughter appointed as a son) that is intended to be referred to therein. Medhātithi, Narayapa and Kullūka interpret the word * duhita &rsquo; in Manu IX, 130 as applicable to the putrikā only. In the Nirukta,135 Yaska cites Rg. III. 31. 1 as relied upon by those who support the claims of the daughter to inheritance and also derives the word &lsquo;duhitā&rsquo; in various ways, but from his expla nation of Rg. III. 31. 1 it appears that he is referring to the putrika&rsquo;s right of inheritance. As the usage of appointing a daughter as a son became gradually obsolete, the ordinary daughter came to be recognized by analogy as the heir of a sonloss man after the widow. Yaj. and Viṣṇu both recognize the daughter as an heir after the widow. Nar. (dāyabhāga, 50 ) recognizes 1356 the daughter as an heir after the son on the ground that she continues the lineage ( of the deceased father) just like &amp; son. When Nar. (dāyabhaga, 27 ) speaks of the daughter being entitled to maintenance till marriage, the con text shows ( as remarked by the Sm. O. II. p. 296 ) that he is referring to the daughter of a person who was re-united at the time of his death. Br. declares 1367 ( 8. B. E. 33 p. 378 verkar 55-56 ), the wife is declared to be the inheritor of the husband&rsquo;s wealth and, in default of har, the daughter; the daughter, like a son, springs from the limbs of a man: how can another man inherit her father&rsquo;s property while she lives?&rsquo;, Though the words of Yaj., Viṣṇu and Bș. were clear enough ancient com.</p>

<p>mentators were not prepared to accept them in their literal Pense. . Viśvaripa holds that Yaj. means only the putrika and employs the plural in order to convey that several daughters may be appointed as sons. The Sm. O. II. p. 295 informs us that the same opinion was held by Dhāreśvara, Davasvamin and Devarāta. 1368 . The Mit. rightly refutes these views by saying that the word &rsquo; duhitarah in Yaj. cannot refer to &lsquo;putrika&rsquo;, since Yaj., has himself stated the putrikā as equal to the aurasa son (in II. 128), as the putrika is included among the sons by Vas, and as the widow and the daughters are declared by him as heirs in the absence of all the sons, principal and secon dary. Yaj., Viṣṇu, Bf. are silent as to whether any discrimina tion was made between daughters as heirs. Kat. (926) gives1369 a preference to the unmarried daughter and the Mit. and the subsequent digests follow Kate The Dayabhaga1370 (XI.2.4 p. 175) quotes a prose passage of Parasara preferring an un married daughter as an heir to a married daughter. Among married daughters the Mit., pressing into service a text of Gaut. on succession to stridhana, holds by analogy that among married daughters the indigent (or unprovided for) one is to be preferred to one who is well-placed. 1371 Heroin the Miti follows common sense and the natural inclination of a father to feel more concern for a poor daughter. The Dayabbage prefers the unmarried daughter to the married daughter as la done by the Mit., but among married daughters Jimātaythana, following an author oalled Dikṣita, prefers one who has had a</p>

<p>son or who is likely to have a son to a widowed or barren daughter or to one who has given birth only to daughters. This preference is due to the principle of the Dayabhāga 1373 that spiritual benefit is the governing factor in succession. The barren daughter or widowed daughter is unable to confor spiritual benefit on her father since she will have no son that will offer pindas to the deceased owner (who will be the mater nal grand-father). The Mit. on the other hand relies on near ness of blood (prattyāsatti) as the guiding principle. But, de pointed out by the V. P. p. 519, the Dayabhāga is inconsistent. There is no reason on its own principle why the unmarried daughter should be preferred to a married daughter who has a son. The latter is then and there capable of conferring spiri tual benefit while it is problematical whether the unmarried daughter will confer spiritual benefit (since she may after all be blessed with no son after marriage ). Aparārka (p.721 ) and V. R. (p. 517) give three meanings of the word &rsquo; apratisthita&rsquo; vis. &lsquo;childless, poor, widowed&rsquo;. In deciding whether a parti oular married daughter is indigent as compared with another, the Courts refuse 1373 to go into nice or minute questions of the respective monetary positions of their husbands and prefer one to the other only if there is great disparity or marked difference between their positions.</p>

<p>According to all High Courts in India except that of Bombay a daughter&rsquo;s estate is similar to that of the widow, She takes only a limited interest, can only enjoy the usufruot of the property and cannot alienate it.

<p>Succession of daughters</p>
<p>717</p>
<p>In her father&rsquo;s estate when she succeeds as heir and on her death the estate will go to her own heirs.</p>
<p>A daughter is entitled to succeed, according to the decided cases, to her father&rsquo;s estate even if she be unchaste at the time of his death (except in cases governed by the Dayabhāga ).1375 The reagon assigned is that Kāt, and other smrti writers do not expressly mention the requirement of chastity in the case of the daughter or mother as they do as regards the widow. According to the 1376 Dayabhaga (XI. 2. 8) Bp. declares : &lsquo;a daughter equal in caste to the father and married to a husband of the same caste as her own, who is virtuous and intent on serving her husband, inherits her father&rsquo;s property&rsquo;. Therefore #-daughter who is unchaste cannot inherit. Further a daughter Buoceeds not because she is the daughter, but because she satisfies all conditions laid down by Bș. The Dayabhāga ( XI. 2. 31 ) further says that the word &lsquo;wife&rsquo; (in XI. 1. 56) is merely Illustrative and whatever restrictions are imposed on the wife apply to all women as heirs. The illegitimate daughter, even of a sūdra, has no right of inheritance to her father. 1377</p>
<p>By virtue of local or family custom daughters have in some cases been held to be excluded from inheritance, 1378 . . It may be noted that in his Vaijayanti ( on Viṣṇu Dh. 8. XVII. 5-6) Nandapandita appears to have preferred a daughter in-law to a daughter; but he stands practically alone in this. Vide Jolly&rsquo;s T. L.

<p>otraja and not before a daughter. P&hellip; Raghunandana in his comment on the Dayabbāga makes the position about unchaste daughters quite clear 1379. The antis give preference among daughters to an unmarried daughter i. a. to a daughter who is a virgin ( kumāri). It has béon held by the Indian High Courts that though chastity is not required in the case of daughters to entitle them to inherit, yet in a competition between a married daughter and a daughter who was never married, but became a concubine or prostitute, the latter would be postponed to the former as the lātter is not a virgin though unmarried. Some emptis like Partsara 1300 employ the word kumāri in speaking of daughters&rsquo; Buodession, while others employ the word &lsquo;kanya&rsquo;, but both words are synonymous. In Govind v. Bhiku 46 Bom. L. R. 699, where &amp; man died leaving as heirs &amp; married daughter and another daughter who never married, but was living as the permanent concubine of another man, it was held that the latter &lsquo;cannot inherit the property of her sonless father to the exclusion of or along with his married daughter. The old texts speak of only unmarried daughters and married daughters and prefer the former to the latter. Medhātithi on Manu IX. 132 says that kanya means a girl who has had no sexual intercourse with any man. The Mit, makes three classes of daughters suoceed one after another viz. (1) unmarried daughter, (2) indigent married daughter, (3) well-to-do married daughter. Judicial decisions have added a fourth yariety viz. unmarried daughter who has become a prostitute. This fourth olags being a new one must be pleoed after the other three classes expressly mentioned by the texte and commentaries on the basis of the maxim (intrudere of uninvited persons must be seated at the end of or after those</p>

<p>• The daughter&rsquo;s son ( dauhitra). On failure of daughters the daughter&rsquo;s son inherits. Gaut., Ap., Vas., are all silent about the daughter&rsquo;s son and so are Yaj. and Viṣṇu. But it has been plausibly urged by Viśvarūpa that, since 1381 Yāj. himself has (in II. 134 ) stated that the illegitimate son of a sūdra takes the whole estate if there be no legitimate son provided there exista no heir up to the daughter&rsquo;s son, the latter must have been intended to be an heir by Yāj. taking after the daughters. The Madanapārijāta (p. 672) relies on the word &lsquo;oa&rsquo; in Yaj. to bring in the daughter&rsquo;s son. Though the printed text of Viṣṇu Dh. 8. is silent about the daughter&rsquo;s son, the Mit., the Daya. bbāga and others quote a verse of Viṣṇu, 1382 &rsquo; when there is no continuance of lineage through sons and son&rsquo;s son the daughter&rsquo;s Bons take the wealth (of the deceased owner); in offering srāddha to the ancestora, daughter&rsquo;s sons are regarded as son&rsquo;s song&rsquo;. The V. Mayūkha (p. 142 ) includes a sūtra about the dauhitra in Vinnu Dh. S. Govindaraja, a commentator of Manu, is said by the Dāyabhaga, to have held, relying on this verse of Viṣṇu, that the daughter&rsquo;s son inherited tille estate even before a married daughter of the deceased. But the Dayabhāga did not approve of this view. The Diyabhāga (XI. 2. 27 ) notes that Balaka held that as the daughter&rsquo;s son was not expressly named by Yaj. he came in as an heir after all those that were expressly mentioned as heirs. Baud. Dh. 8. IL. %. 17 distin guished 1383 between the putrikāputra and daughter but it is not clear whether Baud. intended to lay down that the dauhitra was en betr.

But Manu IX. 136 is somewhat clearer. It says, through a son born to a daughter from a husband of the same class, whether she be appointed ( as a son) or not, the maternal grand-father becomes one having a son&rsquo;s son; that son should offer pinda and take the wealth of the maternal grandfather&rsquo;. The Mit. takes the word &lsquo;akrta&rsquo; in this verse as referring to the ordi nary daughter, while Medhātithi and Kullūka hold that this Verse also only refers to the son of the putrika and that krt. means an appointed daughter with regard to whom an express agreement was made with her husband, while akstā means one (who is intended mentally to be appointed as a son) about whom there is no such express agreement. Bṛ. (8. B. E. 33 p. 379 verse 58 ) provides : &lsquo;just as (the daughter ) gets ownership in her father&rsquo;s property (as an heir ), though įthere may be other relatives, so her son also becomes the owner of his mother&rsquo;s and maternal grand-father&rsquo;s property : 1384</p>
<p>The daughter&rsquo;s sons inherit per capita and not per stirpes, Suppose that A has two daughters B and C, that B has three Bons and C has two sons, that then both B and C. die in A&rsquo;s Botime; on A&rsquo;s death his estate will be divided into five parts,</p>
<p>each daughter&rsquo;s son taking one fifth. .&rsquo;</p>
<p>A daughter&rsquo;s son is really a bandhu and a bhinnagotra sapinda, but owing to historical causes and the high religious efficacy of the srāddha offered by him he has been given a very high place among heirs by express texts.</p>

<p>Viṣṇu Dh. 1385 S. as read by most digests places the father before the mother. Manu IX. 217 states that when the son dies issueless the mother takes his wealth, while Manu IX. 185 provides that the father takes the wealth of a sonless man and the brothers also. So Manu is not definite about the preference among parents. Kat. (927) observes, 1356 &lsquo;of a sonless man (the heirs ) are declared to be the wife of good family, the daughters, the father on failure of them, the inother, the brother and the brother&rsquo;s) sons&rsquo;. Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 v. 63) says,1387 &lsquo;when a son dies without leaving his own wife or male issue, his mother is to be considered as her son&rsquo;s heir or a brother may succeed with the consent of the mother&rsquo;. In this conflict it may be stated that the Mit., the Madanapārijāta, S. V. (p. 416 ), the V.C., the V. P. prefer the mother to the father; while the Dayabhaga, the Sm. C., the Madanaratna, the V. Mayakha prefer the father to the mother. Srikara 1388 held that both parents, if alive, succeed together. But the Dayabhāga, Sm. C.</p>

<p>and others criticise this view. The reasons why the Mit. prefers the mother before the father are three, out of which two are based on grammar. The word &lsquo;pitarau &rsquo; in Yāj. is what is called an &rsquo;ekasesa&rsquo; dvandra compound and in dissolving it or in the full-fledged dvandva the mother comes first in order and hence she should be preferred. Another reason is : 1389 A father may have several wives and song from them all, so that a mother is directly related to her own son only and not to the other sons of her husband. So ( the Mit, says ) the mother has greater nearness (prattyāsatti) to her son than the father has. The Sm. C. (II. p. 297) refers to Jai. V. 1. 14 where the Vedic sentencesārasvatau bhavataḥ&rsquo; is interpreted and it is stated that the first oblation is offered to Sarasvati because the Yājyā and Anuvākyā verses as first set out are meant for Sarasvati (and not on the ground of the method in which the ekaśeṣa is dissolved); therefore as to pitarau also no reliance should be placed on the dissolution of the compound. Nilakantha in the V. Mayūkha denies the assumptions based upon grammar, says that Pāṇ. does not direct that in dissolving the compound the word mātā must be employed first and there is no authority for doing so, 1390 But the V. P. says that though Pāṇini may</p>

<p>The general rule is that several words that would be in the same case when separately used may be compounded together to form a dvandva, when they are employed to convey the sense of &lsquo;ca&rsquo;, as said in &lsquo;carthe dvandvah&rsquo; (Pān. II. 2. 297. Such a compound is called dvandva and mātā-pitarau is an example of it. Another sūtra (I. 2. 64) of Pāṇini states that when words denoting several individuals of the same kind are to be compounded together, only one of them may be retained and that is called an ekaśeṣa compound, which is of two kinds, sarīpa (e. g. hamsasca hamsasca bansau) and virupa ( when the two words are of different genders). The latter kind of ekaśesa is of restricted use. In such a compound when a male and female are asso ciated together only the word in the masculine gender remains or the word</p>

There fore we have two forms to denote the idea of parents viz. matapitarau or pitarau, Io dissolving this compound (pitarau ) we employ the phraseology mātā ca pitā ca and in the word &rsquo;nātāpitarau&rsquo; the word for mother comes first. Therefore among parents as beirs mother should come first. Vide pp. 242-244 of my notes to the V. Mayūkba (ed, of text) wbere both the Mit. passage and its criticism by the V. Mayūkha are explained at length. In Balkrishna v. Lakshman 14 Bom. 603 both the Mit. and Mayūkha&rsquo;s criticism thereof are set out (pp. 608-609).</p>
<p>III)</p>
<p>Preference among parents</p>
<p>723</p>
<p>contain no such direction, all grammatical works like the Kaśikā dissolve the compound as mātā ca pitā ca&rsquo; and gram matical usage for centuries supports the argument that the word mātā, comes first 1391. The argument about the mother being nearer is quite specious. Looked at from the son (whose inheritance is in question), the mother and father are both equally proximate. The V. P. holds that according to the maxim that even a slight ground of difference leads one to determine (priority) the mother should be preferred to the father ( since we dissolve the compound as mātā ca pitā ca). The V. P. (p. 525) further tries to get over the text of Viṣṇu (putting the father before the mother) by explaining that if the mother is most worthy as a pativratū and the father an ordinary man she should be preferred but if the father is more worthy than the mother he should be preferred. Hardly any one sup ports V. P, and the courts have not followed this. Owing to the difference of opinion among the digests on the question of the preference between parents as heirs, queer results follow. For example, in the province of Bombay itself the father is pre ferred as an heir to the mother in Gujerat, the island of Bombay and in Northern Konkan (because in these regions the V. Mayūkha has been held to be of paramount authority ), while in the rest of the Bombay Presidency the mother is preferred to the father as an heir. The inother takes a limited interest as an heir which is the same as the interest taken by a widow as heir to her husband. The father would take an absolute inte rest. The word mother includes an adoptive mother; that is, if an adopted son dies leaving no son, widow, daughter or daughter&rsquo;s son, the adoptive mother would succeed 1392 to him as an heir (and even in preference to the adoptive father in those provinces where the Mit. is the supreme authority). In the case of a dvyāmugyāyana adoption, if the son adopted in that form dies leaving only his adoptive mother and natural mother, it has been held that both the mothers take his estate</p>

<p>as co-heiresses. 1333 It has further been held that if, after suc ceeding as adoptive mother to a dvyāmuṣyāyana son, the adop tive mother again adopts a son, the latter does not deprive the natural mother of the half share taken by her as heir of the deceased dvyāmuṇyāyaṇa son.</p>
<p>The word &lsquo;mother&rsquo; in the Mit. does not include a step mother. The latter is not recognised as an heir of her step-son at all in the whole of India (except in Bombay) on account of the rule of the exclusion of women from inheritance 1394 except where texts expressly mention them as heirs and the property would go to the crown instead of to the step-mother, if the latter alone were left, but she would be entitled to maintenance. In Bombay the step-mother would inherit as the widow of a gotraja sapinda, but she is assigned a remote 1395 place among gotraja sapiṇdas. If a widow remarries and then her son by her first husband dies without leaving a child, a widow, a daughter or daughter&rsquo;s son his remarried mother is allowed to inherit to him by the 1396 Boinbay High Court, though if she inherited first as a mother and then remarried, she is held by the same court to forfeit the inheritance taken (on account of section 2 of the Hindu Widows&rsquo; Remarriage Act of 1856).</p>
<p>The mother succeeding to her son takes only a limited estate i. e. she cannot alienate it except for legal necessity. If Vijñāneśvara&rsquo;s definition of stridhana be literally interpreted even property inherited from a son would be stridhana. There is a striking example in E. I vol. XIV p. 83 ( the Srirangam plates of Mummadi Nayaka in sake 1280) where a mother in heriting a village granted to her son Parāśarabhatta made a gift of it to the god Ranganātha at Srirangam.</p>

<p>Brothers and their sons as heirs</p>
<p>725</p>
<p>Brothers (bhrataraḥ) and brother&rsquo;s sons. Acc. to both Yāj. and Viṣṇu, on failure of the parents the brothers succeed and on failure of brothers, brother&rsquo;s sons inherit. There were appa rently conflicting texts, Saṅkha, Manu (IX. 185) and others giving the inheritance to the brothers even before the parents. All these are somehow reconciled and almost all digests from the Mit. downwards are agreed that brothers inherit after the parents. But again a conflict of views ensues. The Mit. says that among brothers, those of full blood inherit in preference to half brothers ( i. e. sons of the same father but sprung from a different mother). It then says that on failure of both kinds of brothers, the inheritance goes to brother&rsquo;s sons; but even here the sons of full brothers are preferred to sons of half brothers. This view of the Mit. is shared by the Dāyabhaga and almost all eininent writers of digests except the author of the V. Mayūkha. The Mit. prefers the full brother to the half brother on the ground that the full brother has particles of the bodies of both the father and the mother of the deceased, while the half brother has only the particles of the father&rsquo;s body (the mother being different). Therefore the full brother is nearer than the half brother. The Dāyabhāga argues 139 that the full brother offers pindas to the same three paternal ancestors and the same three maternal ancestors to whom the deceased was bound to offer piṇdas and is to be preferred to the half brother who offers piṇdas to the three paternal ancestors of the deceased alone (but not to the maternal ancestors of the deceased). This view of spiritual benefit being the governing principle in pre ferring the full brother to the half brother is accepted by Aparārka (p. 745 ), 1398 The reasons of the V. Mayūkha for pre ferring even the full brother&rsquo;s son to the half brother are: the word &lsquo;brothers&rsquo; principally stands for &lsquo;brothers of the whole blood&rsquo; (sodara) and only secondarily for brothers of the half blood. The general rule of Mimārsā 1399 is that the game word is</p>

<p>not to be understood in the same sentence or rule as used in the primary and also in the secondary sense. Just as the word &lsquo;mother applies only to the natural mother (and not to the step-mother), so bhrātaraḥ should not include both full and half brothers. The V. Mayūkha is however wrong. As pointed out by the Dāyabhāga, when Yaj. wants to speak of the full brother he employs the words sodara&rsquo; (Yāj. II. 138) and when he wants to refer to the half brother he employs the word &lsquo;anyodarya&rsquo; or &lsquo;anyamūtrja&rsquo; (Yaj. II. 139). Therefore the word &lsquo;bbrātarah&rsquo; applies to both full and half brothers in the primary sense. There are other smsti texts such as that of the Smṛti-sangraha stating that brothers are of two kinds viz. those of full blood and those of half blood. 1400</p>
<p>The Sm, 1401 C. II. 300 refutes the view of some that the word &lsquo;bhrātaraḥ&rsquo; in Yāj. is an ekaśeṣa dvandva compound that it means &lsquo;brothers and sisters&rsquo; according to Pān. I. 2. 68&rsquo; ( bhrāts-putrau svass-duhitsbhyām) and that on failure of brothers sisters inherit. The V. Mayūkha 1402 also does not accept this interpretation of &lsquo;bhratarah&rsquo; advanced by some, since there is no reason why &lsquo;bhrātaraḥ&rsquo; should be taken as an ekaśeṣa of the virūpa kind ( which is restricted only to rare cases) and not of the sarūpa kind. The Balambhatti supports the wider interpretation of &quot; bhrātarah&rsquo; and at one time the Bombay High Court was inclined to accept this</p>

<p>727</p>
<p>interpretation. 1403 The above shows that some at least of the medieval and later Hindu jurists were more sympathetic and well disposed to the enlargement of the rights of women, though their views, failed to sooure general acceptance. It has been held that brothers by the same father (though by different mothers) are preferred to brothers by the same mother (though by different fathers ), it being pointed out that &ldquo;there is no provision in the Mitakṣarā or elsewhere for the sons born of the same mother after her remarriage being treated as brothers of the same womb for the purpose of inheritance so as to be included in the meaning of the word &lsquo;bhrātarah&rsquo; used in the texts.&ldquo;1404 But Nandapandita expressly provides in his Vaijayanti the following order of succession among brothers and sisters of the whole and of the half blood: (1) brothers of the whole blood, (2) sisters of the whole blood, (3) brothers who are sons of the same father, (4) brothers who are sons of the same motber (vide Jolly T. L. L. pp. 208 and 287). Because Manu IX. 217 says that the wealth of a childless man is taken by the mother and that if the mother be dead, the father&rsquo;s mother would take it, the Sm. C. II. p. 299 places the paternal grand mother before the brothers, but it stands almost alone in this and the Mit. observes 1405 that Manu does not lay down the order but only provides that the paternal grand-mother is an heir capable of inheriting. The V. P. (p. 527) expresses its dissatisfaction with this method of the Mit. whereby only Yāj. and Viṣṇu are deemed to lay down the order in which heirs</p>

<p>take, while Manu, Saṅkha and others are deemed to be only concerned with declaring the right of certain persons to inherit.</p>
<p>The V. Mayūkha proposes a special order of inheritance as follows :-(1) full brothers; (2) then full brother&rsquo;s sons ; (3) the gotraja sapiṇdas of whom the first is the paternal grand mother, (4) then the sister, (5) then the paternal grandfather and the half brother at the same time, (6) then the paternal great-grandfather, paternal uncle and the half brother&rsquo;s son together. It should be noted that this conjoint inheritance by heirs of different degrees of ascent and descent which is peculiar to the Mayukha has been regarded by the Bombay High Court as unknown in practice and obsolete. 1406 Therefore it is probable that even in districts governed by the Mayukha the order of heirs after the paternal grandmother and full sister would be half brother, then half sister and then half brother&rsquo;s son and then it will be the same both according to the Mit. and the Mayūkha,</p>
<p>The Mit, does not expressly mention the sister at all but the Bombay High Court has held her to be a very near heir even where the Mit. is paramount, placing her after the brothers (whether full or half ), brother&rsquo;s sons (whether of the whole blood or half blood ) and paternal grandmother, the difference from the Mayūkha being that under the latter the full sister comes only after the full brothers and full brother&rsquo;s sons and paternal grandmother and before half brothers and half brother&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<p>One passage of the Mayūkha, being wrongly translated by Borradaile, has led the courts (including the P. C.) to decide that full brothers succeed along with the sons of a deceased full brother wherever the Mayūkba is supreme. The passage of the Mayukha as translated by Borradaile (vide Stokes H. L. Books p. 88, IV. 8. 17) runs &ldquo;the sons of a brother also, if themselves fatherless, at the time of the paternal uncle&rsquo;s death, provided they are capable of understanding (the use of) property, will divide the father&rsquo;s share with their father&rsquo;s other brothers, after the example among grandsons by different fathers, the allotment of shares jg according to the fathers&rsquo;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Misunderstood Mayūkha passage</p>
<p>729</p>
<p>The text of the Mayūkha is given in the note below. It is 1407 almost the same as a passage of the Mitākṣarā, which has not been misunderstood. Both passages contemplate a case like this. A dies leaving B, C, D, his brothers, as his nearest heirs, 80 that A&rsquo;s estate vests in interest in B, C, D. Before the estate of A is actually divided by metes and bounds, B dies leaving three sons E, F, G. The last three had no right to the property of A at their uncle A&rsquo;s death because their father B was living at the time (i. e. pitvyamaranakāle jivatpitskataya asanjata-dlanasambandhāh). Yet when the property is later on actually to be divided they ( E, F, G) will take the share which their father B would have taken if the property of A had been divided at the moment of A&rsquo;s death. Here a distinction is drawn between vesting of property (dhanasambandha) and its actual partition. But, in order to entitle nephews to take by actual partition, their father should have survived the deceased.</p>
<p>This is the real meaning,</p>
<p>The Privy 1408 Council, following a wrong translation, held that, under the law of the V. Mayūkha, brothers and the sons</p>

Mayukha was composed, on the ground that the Mayukha only embodied and defined pre-existing customs. There was thus a double error. The Mayukha was misunderstood and fur ther the Mayukha had nothing to do with Gujerat usages as it was com. posed by a Mahārāsgrā brāhmaṇa wbose family had migrated to Benares. It may be true to some extent as a general proposition that commentators and digest writers embody pre-existing customs of the districts where they wrote. But often times this is not so and varying statements of the law are due to individual opinions. For example, the Mayūkha provides for the simultaneous succession of the paternal great-grandfather, the paternal uacle and the half brotber&rsquo;s son ; but the Bombay High Court has discarded this view of the Mayūkha. The Mayūkha places the father before the mother as an beir, but V. T. composed by Nilakantha&rsquo;s own first cousin</p>

<p>of a brother that died before the propositus ( the brother inherit ance to whom is in question) shared the estate of the latter. This erroneous decision has been persisted in to this day on the principle of stare decisis. The view of the Vaijayanti about the sons of the same woman from different husbands being sapindas of each other has already been noted (p. 727). Govindarāja on Manu DIL 11 says that it is wellknown that children of different fathers but of the same mother are spoken of as brother and sister. Kullūka on Manu III. 11 refers to this view of Govindarāja. 1409</p>
<p>A question arises whether the distinction between full blood and half blood made by the Mit, in the case of brothers and nephews was to be carried beyond them. Though a Full Bench 1410 of the Bombay High Court held that the dis tinction was not to be carried beyond brothers and nephews. and that paternal uncles of the half blood inherited along with paternal uncles of the full blood, the Privy Council over ruled this decision and held that the preference of the whole blood to the half blood extends to all sapiṇdas of the same degree from the common ancestor (and therefore a paternal uncle of the whole blood excludes one of the half blood ). The Madanapārijāta 1411 p. 674 expressly extends the preference of the whole blood to paternal wholes,</p>

R, 516 that the son of a predeceased brother inherited along with the brothers of the deceased. This rule is not to be carried beyond brothers and brothers&rsquo; sons. In Kesarial o. Jagubhai 49 Bom. 282 the differring translations of the Mayukha were referred to (at. p. 286), it was held that the principle of stare decisis required that the Privy Council decision should be followed and the estate of a deceased brother was allowed to devolve on the sons of a brother that had died before the deceased along with the surviviog brother.</p>

<p>Compact series of heirs</p>
<p>731</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the Viramitrodaya which generally follows the Mit. invokes the principle of spiritual benefit in preferring the full brother&rsquo;s son to the half brother&rsquo;s son. 1412</p>
<p>The heirs from the wife to the brother&rsquo;s Bons are spoken of as &lsquo;baddhakrama&rsquo; (lit. whose order is fixed) in the Mit., the V. Mayūkha (p. 143 ) and other works and as &rsquo;the compact series (of heirs )&rsquo; in the case law. For example, in rejecting the view of some that rely on Manu IX, 217 that the father&rsquo;s mother succeeds immediately after the mother, it is said that the heirs from the parents to the brother&rsquo;s son being mentioned in a fixed order (by Yāj.), no place can be found for the father&rsquo;s inother in the fixed series of heirs and that Manu IX. 187 indicates only this that the father&rsquo;s mother is an heir. 1413 The V. Mayūkha relies on the popular maxim that when certain persons are specially invited for a meeting or a dinner they are seated on seats definitely allotted to them but that those who come uninvited are assigned places at the end of the row of those who were specially invited. 1414</p>
<p>The question ariges whether the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son inherits immediately after the brother&rsquo;s son and before any other heir. There is a conflict among Sanskrit writers on this point. The Sm. C. II. p. 300, 1415 the Subodhins, the Madanapārijāta (p. 673) say that the compact series ends with the brother&rsquo;s son, while Aparārka, Varadarāja (V. Nir, p. 453 ) and the Vaijayanti of Nandapandita hold that the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son comes immediate</p>

<p>ly after the brother&rsquo;s son. A Full Bench of the 1416 Bombay High Court holds, basing its decision on the usage of the province, that the compact series ends with the brother&rsquo;s son, while the Privy Council would seem to lend colour to the view that in the Benares school it ends with the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son. The Dayabhāga (XI. 6.6 p. 208) places the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son immediately after the brother&rsquo;s son on the ground of the superior efficacy of the pipdas offered by him.</p>
<p>Gotrajas (lit. &rsquo;those born in the same gotra&rsquo; or agnates ). Yaj. says that on failure of the heirs up to brother&rsquo;s song the gotrajas succeed. Though one&rsquo;s father, brothers and brother&rsquo;s Bons also are really gotrajas, they are expressly assigned cer tain fixed places in the order of heirs and other persons born in the gotra are included in the term gotrajas on the analogy of such an example as &rsquo;let the cattle be brought and also the bulls&rsquo; where the bulls, though really included under &lsquo;cattle (gāvaḥ), are separately mentioned in order to emphasize that special attention must be paid to them on account of their in tractable nature. Vide p. 526 note 966 above, Acc. to the Mit. gotrajas are the father&rsquo;s mother ( as the first among them ), then other gapiṇdas and samānodakas. The V. Mayūkha (p. 143 ) also says the same thing and places the father&rsquo;s mother as the first among gotraja sapiṇdas. It may be remarked that Yāj. avoids the word sapiṇda and employs the word gotraja. The Mit. and Mayūkha state that sapiṇdas succeed as heirs and that sapiṇdas are of two kinds, viz. gotrajas ( born in or having the same gotra as the propositus ) and those that are born in (or are of) a different gotra. These latter (viz. bhinnagotra sapindas ) are designated as bandhus by Yaj. Therefore it comes to this that, though Yaj. does not employ the word sapinda, the inheri tance goes after the brother&rsquo;s son to the nearest sapinda. Yāj. knew the word &lsquo;sapiṇda&rsquo; (I 52) and defines the limits of sapiṇda relationship for marriage (in I. 53), from which it follows that he does not use the word sapiṇda in the senge given to the word by Jimõtavāhana. In I. 68 Yaj. mentions both sapiṇda and sagotra (in the matter of niyoga ) and thereby indi cates two things viz. that the words were not synonymous and that sagotra had the same sense as gotraja.</p>

<p>Meaning of sapinda in Mann</p>
<p>733</p>
<p>Ap. Dh. S. II. 6, 14, % provides 1417 that&rsquo;on failure of sons the nearest sapinda&rsquo;(inherits). Manu 1418 IX. 187 is the classi cal text on this point, which appears to mean literally, &lsquo;whoever is nearest from among the sapindas, to him the estate (of the deceased) shall belong&rsquo;. This verse has been variously ex plained by the commentators and digests and variously trans lated by eminent Judges and writers on Hindu Law. The chief difficulty lies in the expression sapiṇdādyah&rsquo; and the words tasya tasya&rsquo;. Some take the first as equal to two words</p>
<p>sapiṇdāt yah&rsquo; and others as one word &lsquo;gapiṇdadyaḥ&rsquo; (sapiṇda and the like). Some take one &rsquo; tasya&rsquo; (of him) as referring to the deceased and the other to the inheritor; while others take * tasya tasya&rsquo; as both referring to the inheritor alone, corres ponding to&rsquo;yaḥ&rsquo; (one more &lsquo;yaḥ&rsquo; being suppressed for the sake of metre). Though the printed text and most of the commen taries read the half verge of Manu as in the note below there are several digests that read it differently. For example, the Sm. O. II. p. 301 reads it as &lsquo;yo yo hyanantaraḥ piṇdāt&rsquo; and quotes Dhāreśyara&rsquo;s explanation that &lsquo;piṇdāt&rsquo; means &lsquo;sapiṇdāt&rsquo;. Kullūka and the Dāyatattva p. 195 explain &lsquo;sapiṇdāt&rsquo; as * sapindamadhyāt&rsquo; (from among sapiṇdas ) and this appears to be the best explanation. Br. 1419 (S. B. E. 33 p. 379 verge 62 )</p>

<p>n Manu IX. 187. Vide Būhler&rsquo;s note on this in S. B. E, vol. 25 pp. 366-368 for the varying inter pretations of commentators. Būhler is not right when he emphatically says: &ldquo;On philological grounds it seems to me improbable that &lsquo;anantaraḥ sapiṇdāt&rsquo; can mean anything else than &rsquo;nearest to the sapinda &lsquo;and that this sapiṇda can be anybody else than the deceased&rdquo;. In the first place the singular sapiṇdāt&rsquo; can be easily interpreted as used in a generic sense (jātāvekavacanam) i, e, as meaning &lsquo;sapiṇdebhyaḥ&rsquo; (from among sapiṇdas). In Ap., Br, and other works wherever inheritance is spoken of, it is the inheritor who is required to be the sapinda or bandhava or sakulya and the deceased is hardly anywhere spoken of as the sapinda of the in heritor but rather &ldquo;as &lsquo;mrta&rsquo;, &lsquo;svaryāta &lsquo;, dbanin&rsquo; &amp;c.

<p>says, &lsquo;when there are several agnates, sakulyas and bandhairs (cognates ), whosoever of them is the nearest shall take the wealth of him that dies without issue&rsquo;,</p>
<p>The important question is: what is the meaning of the word &lsquo;sapiṇda&rsquo;. The Mitākṣarā and the Dayabhāga propound two different meanings of the word that have been explained at length in H. of Dh. vol. II, pp. 452-458 and 472-477. Therefore it is not necessary to repeat those explanations. The word</p>
<p>sapinda &rsquo; is employed by Pāṇini (IV. 1. 165) in connection with the technical definition of gotra (Pān. IV. 1. 162 ) given by him. It appears to have been used in the sense of blood rela tionship as stated by the Kāsikā. According to the Mit, the right to inheritance depends upon blood relationship ( connec tion through particles of the same body, ekaśarīrūvayavānvaya) and the preference among those who are blood relations is deter muined by nearness or propinquity (pratyāsatti). According to the Dāyabhāga, sapinda relationships is based on religious efficacy i. e, on the capacity to offer the cake or ball of rice in grāddha and it has evolved a peculiar method of determining preference which will be explained immediately below. That there appears to have been a close connection between taking the woalth of the deceased and offering śrāddha to him may be admitted. But the question is whether a person was deemed to be an heir and entitled to take the estate of the decoased because he offered śrāddha to that person or whether the heirship was originally determined on other grounds and whoever took the estate was saddled with the responsibility of performing śrāddhas for the benefit of the soul of the deceased. It is difficult to give a convincing answer to this. It appears, however, that ancient sūtras do not emphasize the religious efficacy of pindas as the determining principle in heirship. Ap., Manu, Br. (particular ly the first and last ) speak only of nearness (which more naturally means &rsquo;nearness of blood &lsquo;). Yaj. omits the word sapiṇda altogether in mentioning heirs. Manu IX. 142 states that pipda follows the gotra and riktha (wealth). Vispu Dh. 8. XV.40 declares,&rsquo; whoever inherits the estate (of the deceased) has to offer piṇda to him&rsquo;. This rule is emphasized even by those works (like V. Mayūkha) 1420 that make blood relationship</p>

<p>the test of heirship by saying that whoever even including the king (who takes by escheat on failure of all heirs ) that takes the estate of the deceased must perform or arrange for the performance of the funeral ceremonies of the deceased up to 10 days after death and the śrāddhas, as said by the Braluna purāṇa 220. 79 (tadabhāve ca nrpatih kārayettvakutunbināmi tajjātiyair-naraiḥ samyak-dāhādyāḥ sakalāh kriyāḥ ). The Mit. view is upheld by V. R., V. C., Par. M., Madanapārijāta, Saras. vativilāga, V. Mayūkha, Bālambhaçṭi and many other works. The theory of the Dayabhāga is propounded by only a few medieval works and writers like Aparārka (quoted above on p. 725), Raghunandana, Nanda pandita. The Viramitrodaya generally follows the Mit, but in certain cases it relies on or refers to the principle of religious efficaoy in preferring one heir to another, as for example, in preferring the full brother to the step-brother (compare note 1397 and V. P. p. 528) or in preferring tlırce male descendants to the widow. It is therefore that the Privy Council remark, 1421 &rsquo;now it is absolutely clear that under the Mitā kṣarā while the right of inheritance arises from blood relationship or community of blood, in judging of the nearness of blood relation ship or propinquity among the gotrajas the test to be applied to discover the preferential heir is the capacity to offer &ldquo;oblations&rsquo;. Its position is peculiar. 1422 It says that the capacity to offer piṇdas is not the governing principle as to heirship, but it is only useful in finding out the preferential heir among gotrajax.</p>
<p>Viṣṇu quoted by the Mit. (not found in the printed Dharmasūtra) prescribes : &lsquo;If there be no son or grandson left for continuing the line, the daughter&rsquo;s sons shall take the wealth, for in regard to the obsequies of ancestors daughter&rsquo;s sons are regarded as son&rsquo;s sons&rsquo;. This is in line with Manu IX. 136 ( cited above on p. 720 ) which says that the daughter&rsquo;s son should offer the pinda and take the wealth. Therofore it appears that Manu, Viṣṇu and others relied upon the capacity for the offering of pinda as the reason for being entitled as heir, but that this idea was vague and not elaborated in any way. The idea that blood relationship settled the right to inheritance is implicit in the order of heirs in Yāj. Yaj. ( II. 127 ) in speaking of the kṣetraja son says that he inherite the wealth of both ( the</p>

So this verse also favours the view that offering of pinda was a duty laid up on him who took the wealth (except in the case of male issue ). Hence it appears that the theory of the Mit. also has a very respectable antiquity and further it has been followed by most medieval writers throughout India ( except in Bengal).</p>
<p>The argument of the Dayabhāga ( which was propounded before it by a writer probably named Udyota 1423) that the taking of a deceased person&rsquo;s estate depends upon the spiritual benefit conferred on him is briefly as follows. It relies princip ally on Baud. Dh, S. and Mapu. In the section on the partition of wealth ( which begins from IX. 103 ) Manu (IX. 137) declares the super-eminent spiritual benefits conferred by the son, grandson and great-grandson; further (in IX. 106 ) Manu states that the son gets all wealth from his father because he frees the latter from debt, that ( in IX. 139 ) the daughter&rsquo;s son also is spoken of as saying the grandfather in the next world and as therefore entitled to the grandfather&rsquo;s wealth, that the verse immediately preceding Manu IX. 187 ( declaring that the nearest amongst sapiṇdas inherits ) speaks of the offering of piṇda to three ancestors; and since it is reasonable to prosume that the blind and the like are excluded from inheritance (Manu IX. 201 ) because they are incapable of performing religious rites, it follows that Manu and others regarded the taking of wealth as dependent on the conferring of spiritual benefit. This point of view the Dayabhāga emphasizes at every step. It 1424 says: &ldquo;There are two purposes for which wealth is acquired, viz. for worldly enjoyment and for the unseen or spiritual benefit derived from making gifts and the like ; but when the acquirer is dead, he cannot have enjoyment of the wealth and the only purpose that remains is the unseen purpose or benefit. It is therefore that Br. says, &lsquo;from the wealth inherited, the inheritor should carefully set apart half for the benefit of the deceased for defraying the expenses of the</p>

<p>monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas&rdquo;. The subject of Grāddhas will be dealt with in another volume. But here it is necessary to say a few words for making the position of the Dayabhāga clear. Among the several kinds of sraddhas two deserve notice, viz. Ekoddiṣta and Pārvana. 1425 The first (ekoddi ṣta ) is performed for the benefit of a single deceased person. There are sixteen such śrāddhas performed for the benefit of the deceased during the course of one year after his death or on the 11th day of death. And every year on the anniversary of death an ekoddista śrāddha may be performed for a deceased person. The pārvaṇa śrāddha is performed on certain specified days, such as the amāvāsyā of a month, or particularly in the dark half or on the amāvāsyā of Bhadrapada or on a sankrānti. In this srāddha the three deceased paternal ancestors of the performer are principally invoked and the three deceased paternal ancestors of his mother are also invoked but their invocation is secondary and is dependent on the principal invocation. There is one more word that must be explained here viz. sapindana or sapindikarana. This is a grāddha rite performed one year after the death of a person or on the 12th day from his death. By this grāddha the person recently deceased ceases to be a preta ( a departed spirit) and is elevated to the rank of pitss (Manes). The widow and daughter can perform only the ekoddista śrāddha, while sons, grandsong and great-grandsons can perform the pārvaṇa śrāddha also. The Dayabhāga refers ( XI. 1. 34 p. 162 ) to the fact that the three male descendants, by performing the pārvana-sraddha, confer great spiritual benefit on the owner (compare note 1342 above ). Elsewhere ( XI. 7. 17 p. 211) it designates the paryaṇa as &rsquo;traipuruṣika&rsquo;(i. e. performed for the benefit of three ancestors).

<p>a widow by leading a chaste life, by offering water mixed with sesame every day to her deceased husband, by making gifts and observing fasts saves himself and her husband in the next world. It adds that if the widow misbehaves she makes her husband fall, as husband and wife share in the fruits of each other&rsquo;s good and evil deeds. Therefore the widow takes her husband&rsquo;s wealth for his benefit. Bphan-Manu (4. by the Dayabhaga XI. 1. 7 and by the Mit. ) declares that a sonless chaste widow should offer pinda to her husband and take his entire estate. Similarly Prajapati (cited above on p. 709 and quoted by even the V. Mayūkha and other works of the Mitakṣarā school) requires the widow who inherits all the movable and im. movable property of her deceased husband to perform the monthly, six-monthly and annual srāddhas of her husband. 1427 Similarly the Dayabhāga allows the unmarried daughter or a married daughter having a son (or who is likely to have a son) to inherit because her son will offer pinda to the owner who will be the maternal grand-father. It prefers the daughter&rsquo;s son 1428 as an heir even to the father because the former offers a pinda to the owner himself, while the father offers pindas to two of the three paternal ancestors to whom the owner would have been bound to offer piṇdas. The D. B. winds up by saying 1439 that the order of inheritors must be followed in such a way that the wealth of the deceased may be most beneficial to the soul of) the deceased. In certain respects the D. B. does not strictly and logically follow its own theory but is compelled to twist it by reason of the places assigned by special</p>

<p>The order of heirs and graddhadhikārins</p>
<p>739</p>
<p>texts to certain heirs. 1430 For example, the order of heirs according to the D. B. is ; son, grandson and great grandson ; widow ; daughter; daughter&rsquo;s son: father; mother; full brother ; half brother; full brother&rsquo;s son; half brother&rsquo;s son. But the persons entitled to perform the śrāddha of the deceased in order are somewhat different. In fact the order of sucoession does not strictly follow in any school the order of those that are called srāddhādhilārins. The order of those who are entitled to offer śrāddha to a deceased separated male ( śrāddhūdhikārin) given in most works is as followe; son ( aurasa or adopted ); grand son; great-grandson; widow; married daughter; unmarried daughter who has succeeded to the doceased&rsquo;s wealth; daughter&rsquo;s son who succeeds to the wealth; full brother; half brother (son of a different mother); full brother&rsquo;s son; half brother&rsquo;s son; father ; mother; daughter-in-law; full sister; half sister; full sister&rsquo;s son; half sister&rsquo;s son; paternal uncle; paternal uncle&rsquo;s son; other gotraja sapindas ; sodaka; any gotraja ; cognates such as maternal grandfather, maternal uncle, maternal uncle&rsquo;s son (i. e. the bandhus of the three kinds in order); pupil; son-in-law ; father-in-law; friend; any brāhmaṇa who takes a brahmana&rsquo;s wealth or king who takes by escheat. Vide Nirnayasindhu III uttarardha pp.382-386, Dharmasindhu III uttarardha pp. 368,369, Sraddhaviveka p. 48. If the principle of the capacity to offer or of the offering of pindas regulating the right to succeed is to be strictly and logically followed, there is no reason why the mother or the paternal grandmother should succeed immediate ly after the father or the paternal grandfather respectively. Her recognition in the D. B. school is due to the fact she is expressly mentioned in Manu as an heir. Similarly in the rules about the succession to re-united copardeners, the school of D. B. gives preference to re-united co-parcenors and does not apply the theory of spiritual benefit. Further the Dāyatattva says that all that is required is the capacity</p>

<p>to receive pinda or the capacity to participate in the pipdas offered by others and not the actual offering of pindas. For example, if a man performs śrāddha for his ancestors, then dies, but no one performs his sapipdana and therefore he does not participate in the pindas given to his ancestors, still his wealth will be inherited on the principle of religious efficacy. 1431 Owing to considerations of space it is not possible to go into great detail about the several proposi tions established in relation to the theory of religious benefit as the determining factor in matters of inheritance. But the following propositions may be set out in one place:</p>
<p>(1) Benefits are conferred on the deceased by means of the ekoddiṣta or the pārvanu śrāddha. The capacity to perform the pārvana śrāddha is not the sole ground on which rests the right to inheritance to a man. Therefore the widow, the daughter and the pupil were recognized as heirs though they perform only the ekoddista śrāddha. But those who are competent to perferm the pārvana śrāddha have a preferable claim to those who are entitled to perform only the ekoddiṣta śrāddha. There fore the male issue of a deceased person are preferred to a widow or daughter.</p>
<p>(2) Spiritual benefit is conferred on a man by presenting piṇda directly to him or by offering pinda to one or more of his paternal ancestors to whom he presents piṇdas during his own life time and with whom he participates in pindas offered after his death by others or by offering a pinda to one or more of his maternal ancestors ( mother&rsquo;s father, mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s father and the latter&rsquo;s father) to whom he was bound to offer pindas during his life (but with whom he does not participate in the piṇda offered to them 1432 ).</p>
<dl>
<dt>(3) The pinda offered to a man himself directly is of greater efficacy than the piṇda offered to a paternal ancestor in which he participates after his own death as one of the Manos. There fore the son, grandson or great-grandson is preferred to every one else. The brother offers a piṇda to the father and two more</dt>

<p>paternal ancestors of the deceased in which he (the deceased owner) only participates after his death. Therefore the brother is postponed to the son or daughter&rsquo;s son (who offers a pinda directly to the deceased himself as his maternal grandfather).</p>
<p>(4) The pindas offered to paternal anoestors have greater efficacy than those offered to maternal ancestors (hence a brother&rsquo;s son is preferred to a sister&rsquo;s son because the former offers pindas to his own and the owner&rsquo;s paternal anoestors, while the latter offers piṇdas to his maternal ancestors who are the paternal ancestors of the owner).</p>
<p>(5) The pinda offered to the owner&rsquo;s father is of greater efficacy than that offered to the paternal grandfather or great grandfather. Therefore a brother&rsquo;s son or grandson is preferred to a paternal uncle. 1433 Hence it should follow that all agnatic and cognatio descendants of the father of the deceased would be preferred to any descendant of the paternal grandfather or great. grandfather.</p>
<p>(6) Where the number of pindas offered by two claimants is the same, he who offers a pinda to the nearer ancestor is to be preferred.</p>
<p>The Dayabhāga, strarting with Baud, Dh. S. (I, 5. 113 ff), Manu (IX. 186-187) and the Matsyapurāpa elaborates its own definition in the following 1434 way. A man&rsquo;s son and a daughter are both born in the family. The daughter&rsquo;s son springs from the family of his maternal grandfather but he belongs to another gotra (viz, his own father&rsquo;s gotra); similarly, a man&rsquo;s sister (i. e. father&rsquo;s daughter) is born in his family but her son, though mediately sprung from the deceased owner&rsquo;s family, belongs to another gotra (viz. that of the sister&rsquo;s husband ): the same is true of a father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son and the paternal grand father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son. A sister&rsquo;s son offers a pinda to the father</p>

<p>of the deceased, as the owner&rsquo;s father is the former&rsquo;s maternal grandfather and therefore he is connected as sapiṇda with the owner. A father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son offers a piṇda to the paternal grand father of the owner, who ( paternal grandfather ) is the maternal grandfather of the father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son. A maternal uncle is not sprung even mediately from the family of the owner, but he offers a piṇda to his own father who is the maternal grandfather of the deceased owner. Therefore the maternal uncle or his son or son&rsquo;s son being connected with a pinda that is offered to the maternal grandfather or maternal great-grandfather respectively of the deceased owner is a sapiada of the deceased owner. A maternal aunt&rsquo;s son also offers a piṇda to his mother&rsquo;s father, who is also the owner&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s father and so the maternal aunt&rsquo;s son is a sapiṇda of the owner. The pindas offered to the maternal ancestors by him are inferior and secondary. Further, one&rsquo;s own mother, the father&rsquo;s mother, father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s inother were associated with their respective husbands as to the pindas offered to the male ancestors and the same holds good about the wives of the maternal ancestors also. 1435</p>
<p>The result of this way of defining a sapiṇda is to obliterate the distinction between a gotraja and a bundhu. Yāj. ( 11. 136 ) expressly says that a bandhu can suoceed only on failure of all gotrajas and so according to him a bandhu is one who is not a gotraja. The Dāyabhāga brings in the sister&rsquo;s son immediately after the the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son and before the paternal grand father (i, e. even before a near agnatio ancestor ) who is literally a gotraja, while the sister&rsquo;s son is literally not a gotraja. When the Dayabhaga designates one&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son as sprung from the kula of the owner though not of the same gotra, he does violence to popular usage prevalent throughout India. An ordinary person in India hardly ever says that his sister&rsquo;s son or father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son is born in his own kula. The Dayabhāga only quibbles over the word &lsquo;gotraja&rsquo; in Yaj. which it reads in the singular (gotrajab) and not in the plural (gotrajāḥ) as the Mit. does. Under the Mit. the sister&rsquo;s son is only a bandhu and cannot succeed before &amp; paternal uncle or his son or a paternal grand-uncle or any other gotraja. The Dayabhāga thus gives the go-by to the text of Yāj. and shuffles in several</p>

<p>cognates as very near heirs. The D. B. regards Manu IX. 186– 187 as the crucial text and Yāj. 11. 135-36 as only secondary.</p>
<p>The following diagrams will illustrate the working of the theory of religious efficacy. A person is a sapiṇda of those to whom he is bound to offer a pinda while he is alive, of those who on his death are bound to offer pinda to him (viz. his three male descendants, his daughter&rsquo;s son, his son&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son and his son&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son) and of those who are bound to offer a piṇda to the ancestors to whom he is bound to offer a pinda viz. to his three paternal ancestors and his three maternal ancestors and all of these are his sapiṇdas. The last of these three groups has four sub-groups :&ndash;sub-group No. 1 comprises those who offer piṇdas to their own paternal ancestors who are also the paternal ancestors of the owner: sub-group II contains those who offer pindas to their three maternal ancestors who are all or some of them the paternal ancestors of the owner, to whom he was bound to offer a pipda; sub-group II comprises those who offer piṇdas to their paternal ancestors all or some of whom are the maternal ancestors of the owner; sub-group IV exhibits those who offer pindas to their own maternal ancestors who are also the maternal ancestors of the owner. Each of these sub-groups contains 9 persons (as the minimum ) who are all shown in thick type. If the owner has several brothers, sisters, uncles and aunts &amp;c. the number of possible sapindas will be much larger. All heirs in the three sub-groups II-IV will be bandhus according to the Mitaksarā and will be post poned to gotrajas under the Mitakṣarā. It should be noticed that Jimūtavābana brought in the father&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son immediately after the father&rsquo;s great-grandson, the paternal grandfather&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son after the paternal grandfather&rsquo;s great-grandson and the paternal great-grandfather&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son immediately after that ancestor&rsquo;s great-grandson on the analogy of the rights of the owner&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son and on the basis of Manu IX. 139 that the dauhitra ( daughter&rsquo;s gon)-saves an ancestor in the next world just as a son&rsquo;s son does. 1436</p>

B. about the working of the theory of religious efficacy.</p>
<p>It will have been noticed that no female except the five expressly mentioned can inherit under the Dāyabhāga scheme and the result is that a man&rsquo;s own son&rsquo;s daughter or daughter&rsquo;s daughter does not take as heir, whereas a distant:relative like the father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son takes it. The same is also the case even under the Mitākṣarī in the whole of India (except in Bombay and to some extent in Madras for which see a little later on).</p>
<p>A man offers only the leayings or remnants of the piṇdas that stick to his hand ( when offering piṇdas to his three paternal ancestors) and that ( leavings) are cast on kusa grass to three paternal ancestors above the paternal great-grandfather (Manu III. 216). So also the three male descendants beyond the great-grandson offer the leavings (called pindalepa ) to the owner; these three remote paternal ancestors and the three remote malo descendants (spoken of as vibhaktadāyāda in Baud. Dh. $. I. 5. 114) are designated sakulya by Baud., and</p>

<p>Meaning of sakulya</p>
<p>747</p>
<p>the D. B.1439 (XI. 1. 38). According to D. B. sakulyas succeed after all sapipdas are exhausted. Just as a man participates after his death in the pindas offered to his paternal ancestors 80 he would participate in the leavings also offered to his paternal ancestors from the 4th to 6th by their descendants (from 4th to 6th). The D. B. remarks that this difference between sapiṇdas and sakulyas is made only in the matter of inheritance. But in the matter of the periods of mourning both the sapiṇdas ( strictly so called in the section on inherit ance ) and the sakulyas are designated sapipdas by Manu (V. 60) and by the Markandeya-purana ( 28. 4).1440 According to Manu IX. 187 salculyas succeed on failure of sapindas, while Viṣṇu Dh. 8. ( XVII. 9-11) prescribes 1441 that on failure of bandhus, sakulyas succeed. It appears that Viṣṇu employs the word bandhu in the sense of sapinda. Nar.(dayabhaga,51) states that on failure of daughters and sakulyas, bāndhavas and persons of the same caste succeed. Here it appears that sakulya and bandhava are employed in the sense of gotraja and bāndhava as done in Yaj. The Balambhatti says that gotraja and sakulya are synonymous. The Dāyabhāga appears to be some what inconsistent in its references to sakulyas. In XI. 6. 15 and 23 it includes samāpodakas among sakulyas, while in XI. 6. 21-22 it defines sakulya as stated above.

<p>The Mit. states that the gotrajns are the paternal grand mother, the sapiṇdas and samānodakas of the deceased. It then proceeds to say that the paternal grandmother is the first among gotrajas, then comes paternal grandfather. It para phrases the word gotraja ( born in the gotra ) as samānagotra (having the same gotra ) and then proceeds, &lsquo;on failure of the father&rsquo;s line ( santāna) the heirs are the paternal grandmother, the paternal grandfather, the paternal uncles and their sons in order; on failure of the paternal grandfather&rsquo;s line the paternal great-grandmother, the paternal great-grandfather, his sons and son&rsquo;s sons inherit. In this manner must be understood the succession of sapindas belonging to the same gotra ( as the deceased) up to the 7th degree&rsquo;. According to the Mit, sapiṇda relationship extends up to the 7th degree ( reckoned from and inolusive of the owner). Therefore the owner&rsquo;s sapiṇdas for purposes of inheritance according to the Mit. are the owner&rsquo;s (1) 6 male descendants in the male line, (2) 6 male ascendants in the male line and the wives of the first three of them (that are expressly so declared, viz. mother, paternal grandmother and paternal great-grandmother) and probably the wives of the next three also; (3) the six male descendants of each of his six male ascendants in the collateral male lines. Besides, a man&rsquo;s wife and daughter are treated as his sapiṇdas and the daughter&rsquo;s son, though a bhinnagotra sapinda, is placed high among the gotraja sapiṇda heirs.</p>
<p>Even under the Mitākṣard in the whole of India (except in the Bombay and Madras schools ), no wonien succeed as gotraja sapiṇdas (except five expressly named and cited above on p. 713 ). In Bombay the sister (full or half) is brought in as a gotraja by the V. Mayūkha ( though the Mitakṣarā is entirely silent) and placed by it immediately after the paternal grandmother. It relies on the general words of Manu IX. 187 and of Bf. ( quoted above on p.733 ) that to the nearest person in blood the inheritance goes and then proceeds: 1442 She is also a gotraja as being born in the gotra in which her brother (the deceased owner) was born. She is, however, not a sagotra (of the deceased brother), but being a sagotra is not mentioned here (in Yaj.) as the condition that leads on to the taking of the wealth of the deceased&rsquo;. Here the V. Mayūkha plays upon the word gotraja and takes its literal meaning. But that is a specious argument. The</p>

<p>Sister as a gotraja heir</p>
<p>749</p>
<p>widow and mother are not gotrajas (in this sense of being born in the gotra) but on marriage they enter the gotra of their husbands and become sagotra. Further, on the same reasoning, a son&rsquo;s daughter, brother&rsquo;s daughter, father&rsquo;s sister and other women born in the family of the deceased will become his gotrajas (though not sagotras because on marriage they pass into the gotra of their husbands). But these other women are not expressly recognised even by the V, Mayukha as gotrajas. Even though she was not mentioned in the Mit. the sister has been recognised as a gotraja sapiṇda by the Bombay High Court in parts of the Bombay Presidency where the Mit. is the paramount authority. The order of heirs under the Mit, would be as follows:-Full brother, half brother, full brother&rsquo;s son, half brother&rsquo;s son, paternal grandmother, sister (full being preferred to half), paternal grandfather. According to the V, Mayūkha the order is slightly different, viz. full brothers along with sons of full brothers that are dead, full brother&rsquo;s son, grandmother, full sister, halfbrother, halfsister, paternal grandfather. The unmarried sister had been recognized as entitled to a share when brotherg came to a partition and they had to provide for her marriage expenses. Vide above pp. 619-620 and Nār. 1443 ( dāyabhāga, 13), Viṣṇu Dh, S. 18, 35, Manu IX. 118, Yaj. II. 124. In Madras the sister had been recognized as a bandhu. The Legislature has intervened and laid down ( Hindu Law of Inheritance Amend mont Act II of 1929 ) that in territories governed by the law of the Mitakṣarā and in respect of the property of males not held in coparcenary and not disposed by will, a son&rsquo;s daughter, daughter&rsquo;s daughter, sister and sister&rsquo;s son shall be entitled to rank as heirs in the order specified in the Act next after a father&rsquo;s father and before a father&rsquo;s brother. The first three of these were before this Act not at all recognized as heirs in the whole of India except in Bombay (where the sister was recog nised as a gotraja sapiṇda and the first two as bandhus ) and except in Madras ( where the first three were recognized only as bandhus ). The sister&rsquo;s son was given a very high place as a sapiṇda under the Dayabhāga and was treated as a bandhu elsewhere in India. This enaótment does not affect the Daya bhaga scheme and so the three females mentioned in the Aot are not heirs even now under the Dayabhaga. The sister&rsquo;s place as settled by Bombay decisions is after the paternal</p>

<p>grandmother and before the paternal grandfather, while the above Act places her after the paternal grandfather. In Bai Mahalaxmi v. The Deputy Nazir 45 Bom. L. R. 434 it has for this reason been held that the Act does not apply to the Bombay Province. If it be held that the Act does apply to Bombay (except as to the sister), then the same Act will have to be deemed to be laying down two different orders of succession as to the same four heirs in different provinces, which, to say the least, is not a reasonable or desirable way of interpreting statutes (just as in the case of texts ).</p>
<p>Some difficulty is caused by the use of the word santāna in the Mit, as regards the father&rsquo;s, grandfather&rsquo;s and great-grand father&rsquo;s line. It has been seen above (p. 731 ) that the compact series ends with the brother&rsquo;s son (father&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son i. e. after two descendants of the father) according to the Bombay High Court, while elsewhere in India it is supposed to end with the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son ( i. e. after three descendants of the father ). The Mit. expressly mentions only two descendants in the grand father&rsquo;s and great-grandfather&rsquo;s line. The general rule is that Bapiṇda relationship extends to six descendants of each line (excluding the man or ancestor from whom the counting is made ). The further general rule gathered from the meagre words of the Mit. is that the nearer line excludes the more remote (eg, the grandfather, his son and grandson are express ly mentioned by the Mit, as taking before the great-grand father, his son and grandson). The question is whether the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th descendants of a nearer line would exclude even the 1st or 2nd descendant of a remoter line e. g. whether the great-grandson of the grandfather would take before the son or grandson of the great-grand-father or whether the 6th descendant of the grandfather would take before the son of the great-grandfather. There were three views 1444 on this point.</p>
<ol start="1444">
<li>Vide Buddha Singh v. Læltu Singh L. R. 42 1. A, 208 pp. 220-24 · for the three views and their expounders. The P. C. overruled the first view and held (p. 227) that the descendants in each ascendlag line up to the fixed limit should be exhausted at any rate to the third degree before making tbe ascent to the next llue in order of succession. m pentru curata unaou n g Portretfag an Art rograma da guarratifuntovauTiT.

</ol>
<p>III</p>
<p>Three views about gotraja succession</p>
<p>751</p>
<p>The first view, relying upon certain words of the Sm. O., held that after two descents in each line, one should ascend into a remoter line and after the two descendants of that line are exhausted, one should revert to the 3rd to 6th descendants of a nearer line.</p>
<p>The 2nd view was that in each line three generations were to be first exhausted, because the word putra in several places in the Mit. includes the three male descendants.</p>
<p>The 3rd view [^1445] was that in each line six descendants were to be exhausted before ascending to the next remoter line ( 48 sapinda relationship extended to six degrees ).</p>
<p>Another question is whether the widows of agnatic relations (such as the son&rsquo;s widow, brother&rsquo;s widow, step-mother or paternal uncle&rsquo;s widow) are included in the term &lsquo;gotrajāḥ&rsquo; for purposes of inheritance. Under the Dāyabhāga, as well as under the Mitākṣarī throughout India (except in the Bombay School), the widows of gotraja sapiṇdas are not heirs at all, since according to almost all writers women do not inherit except when expressly mentioned by texts. In the Bombay School the position is different. According to both the Mit. and the Mayūkha, wives enter by marriage the gotra of their husbands and become sapindas of their husbands. The Balambhatti declared the son&rsquo;s widow to be an heir even before the paternal grandmother and includes females also in the word gotrajāḥ. When gotraja was rendered as samānagotra, the term became wide enough not only to include those born in the gotra but even those who entered the gotra by marriage. Besides, it was argued that if the paternal grandmother or. paternal great-grandmother succeeded as a gotraja there was no reason why other widows of other gotrajas should not succeed. From the earliest days of British rule the gotraja sapindas (such as the son&rsquo;s, brother&rsquo;s, paternal uncle&rsquo;s widows) have been recognized as heirs in the Bombay Presidency. They take only a limited estate like the owner&rsquo;s widow &lsquo;or mother or</p>
<ol start="1445">
<li>The third view was propounded by Telang J. in Rachava v, Kalingappa 16 Bom, 716,&rsquo; which is referred to by the P. C. in 42 I. A, 208. at pp. 220 and 226. The P. C. do not dissent from Telang J. but do not expressly approve of his views as it was not necessary to do so in that case, where the question was whether the great-grandson of the grandfather of the deceased was to be preferred to the grandson of the great-grandfather and it was beld by the P, C, that he was to be preferred. The 2nd view appears to be supported by the words of Aparārka p. 745 &amp; TT NYT स्तत्पौत्र इति पितुसन्तती प्रपा प्रत्यासमाः सपिण्याः । एवं पितामहसन्तती प्रपितामहसन्तती च। एषामभावे पित्रादित्रयस्प ये प्रपौत्रास्तेषां पुत्रादित्रयं सापिण्डवाबनवाएकम् ।।752</li>

They are recognized rather on the ground of positive acceptance and usage&rsquo; by the Privy Council than on the ground of any texts 1446 They occupy the same place as their husbands, succeed after the compact serios, the sister and half-sister and only after all the male gotraja sapiṇdas (up to the 7th degree inclusive of the ancestor ) properly belonging to the line to which their husbands belonged; 0. g. the son&rsquo;s widow would succeed before the brother&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s 1447 son, the brother&rsquo;s widow or step-mother would succeed after all the six male descendants of the husband&rsquo;s father, but before the father&rsquo;s father, paternal uncle or his son &amp;c. These widows of gotraja sapiṇdas succeed before any bandhu. Since Act XVIII of 1937 a man&rsquo;s own widow, his predeceased son&rsquo;s widow and the widow of a predeceased son&rsquo;s predeceased son succeed along with his son or sons throughout India.</p>
<h2 id="samanodakas">Samanodakas.</h2>
<p>According to the Mit. gotrajas are either sapiṇdas or samānodakas. The word &lsquo;samanodaka&rsquo; has a technical meaning. Aco. to Manu V.60, &rsquo;the sapinda relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relationship of samānodaka<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> ends when birth ( in the family) and name are no longer known&rsquo;. This ocours in the chapter on impurity. The Mit. declares that the samānodakas comprise males seven generations beyond the sapiṇdas or all males (beyond sapipdas ) whose birth (in the same family as that of the deceased) and name are known. It quotes a text of Bphan-Manu, &rsquo;the sapinda relationship ceases with the seventh person; the relation of</p>
<p>753</p>
<p>samānodaka ceases after the 14th; according to some it extends as far as the memory of name and family (or birth) reach; the gotra is said to extend up to that&rsquo;. The samanodakas comprise the 7 ascendants of a person after the great-grand father&rsquo;s great-grandfather, the 13 descendants of these seven ascendants, the 7 descendants after the 6th descendant of his 6 male ancestors from his own father; and descendants of himself from the 7th to the 13th. The Privy Council have ruled 149 in a recent case that, according to the Mitākṣarā school, samānodaka relationship does not extend beyond the 14th degree (from and inclusive of the common ancestor of the claimant and the propositus).</p>
<h2 id="succession-of-samānodakas">Succession of samānodakas</h2>
<p>The word &lsquo;samānodaka&rsquo; literally means &rsquo; those who offer to or receive water from the same person&rsquo;. The word is employed by Vas. 1450 17. 79. But in the law of inheritance it has a technical meaning as stated above.</p>

<p>literally so called. According to the Mit. bandhus are sapiṇdas of the deceased belonging to a different gotra. Bandhus succeed under the Mit, the V. Mayūkha and all other authorities except those of the Dayabhāga school only on failure of samānodakas (or sodakas). It will have been noticed from the discussion above that gotrajas, whether sapiṇdas and samā nodakas, are all agnates (and in some cases their wives) i. e, persons related to the deceased by unbroken male descent. The bandhus are persons related to the deceased through one or more females. The basic texts on the inherit ance of bandhus are three verses attributed to Vrddha-Satātapa</p>
<p>( Continued from the last page)</p>
<p>ii):</p>
<p>Three verses on bandhus</p>
<p>955</p>
<p>or Baudhāyana. They may be translated as follows: The sons of one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister, the sons of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister and the sons of one&rsquo;s maternal uncle these are to be known as at mabandhus ( one&rsquo;s own bandhus); the sons of one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister, the sons of one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister, the son&rsquo;s of one&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s maternal uncle&ndash;these are to be known as one&rsquo;s pitsbandhus (father&rsquo;s bandhus ); the sons of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s sister, the sons of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s sister, the sons of one&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s maternal uncle these are to be known as the mālfbandhus mother&rsquo;s bandhus ). 1452 The Mit. states on this toxt that bandhus are of three kinds viz, ātma bandhus, pitrbandhus and mātsbandhus and that atmabandhus succeed before pitsbandhus on account of their greater propin quity to the deceased and pitrbandhus succeed before the mātsbandhus. 1453 The treatment of the rights of bandhus in the Mit. and other commentaries and digests is very meagre. This has led in modern times to a bewildering mass of case law on the inheritance of bandhus.</p>
<p>The first question is whether the enumeration of bandhus in the verses quoted is exhaustive or only illustrative. The V. P. expressly 1454 states that if the enumeration be held to be exhaustive absurd results would follow. For example, a maternal uncle&rsquo;s son is expressly named as an ātmabandhu in the verses quoted above, but his father (the maternal uncle ), being not mentioned, would on that hypothesis be excluded. Therefore it was held by the Privy Council in a very early case 1455 that the enumeration of bandhus is only illustrative, that the maternal uncle though not mentioned is a nearer</p>

<p>bandhu and would succeed in preference to his own son who is expressly mentioned. In Balasubrahmanya v. Subbayya 65 L A, 93 it was held that under the Mitākṣarā the principle of proximity of blood relationship applies to the succession of bandhus, that in determining which of two ātmabandhus is entit led to succeed nearness of degree and not religious efficacy is the proper test to apply, that when the atmabandhus are equal in degree the test of religious efficacy may be applied to determine preference and that the maternal uncle of the deceased is entitled to preference over the deceased&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s half sister&rsquo;s son. This was followed in Virangauda v. Yellappa I. L. R. (1943) Bom. 259 (F. B.) where the mother&rsquo;s brother of the deceased was preferred to the father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son. So also the mother&rsquo;s father would be a bandhu, It is strange that the deceased&rsquo;s own descendants through a female or the deceased&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s descendants through a female such as the son&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son, daughter&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son, daughter&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son, sister&rsquo;s son or sister&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son, are not mentioned in any authoritative commentaries or digests as his bandhus. Further, the bandhus enumerated in the three verses do not go beyond the 4th degree from the common ancestor. But bandhu relationship extends up to five degrees at least. There is an ancient instance of the sister&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son having succeeded to a Buddhist bhikṣu in Cambodia ( in sake 586 ). This would be so only according to the principles of the Mit. Vide Indian Cultural Influence in Cambodia&rsquo;p. 55 by Dr. Bijan Raj Chatterji (Cal. 1928). All the above (such as the son&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son) have been recognized by the Indian Courts as ātmabandhus entitled to inherit. In United Provinces v. Kanhaiya Lal 16 Lucknow 551 it has been held that the father&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son would be an ātmabandhu of the deceased. In an early case 1456 in British India two propositions were laid down, viz. (1) there must be mutuality of sapiṇda relation between the deceased and the claimant (i. e. each must be a sapiṇda of the other) and (2) that in order that a man may be an heritable bandhu of the deceased they must be related directly through themselves or</p>

<p>Propositions about bandhus</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>through their mother or father. These propositions were accepted by the Privy Council, 1457 which further said that sapinda rela tionship extends in the case of bandhus only up to five degrees. The first proposition about mutuality has some support in the interpretation put on the famous verse of Manu IX. 187 by the Balambbatti and the Subodhini (vide above note 1418). But difficulty is created about mutuality by the unwarranted assumption that the common ancestor must be a member of one out of four families as stated by Sarvadhikari. The other propositions, however, are not supported by any texts or sound reasoning. Since the enumeration of bandhus is admitted to be not exhaustive, no sound inference can be drawn from the list of nine bandhus that a heritable bandhu must be connected with the deceased in any particular way. All that can be required is that he must be a bandhu as defined by the Mit, and connected with the deceased by having particles of the body of a common ancestor within the limits of sapinda relationship as laid down by the Mit. The limit of five degrees categorically laid down by the P. C. is not, it is sub mitted with great respect, based on very sure or strong founda tions. The Mit. says that sapiṇda relationship extends to seven degrees when traced through the father, that wherever the word</p>
<p>sapinda&rsquo; is employed this meaning has to be understood and it extends up to five degrees when traced through the mother. Vide H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 454-455. What is material is</p>
<ol start="1457">
<li>Vide Ramchandra v. Vinayak L. R. 41 I. A. 290 (→ 42 Cal. 384 at pp.-418-421) for the propositions about mutuality, relationship through bimself, father or mother and restriction to five degrees. Dr. Sarva dhikari (T. L, L. p. 630ff) is not right ia inferring from the nine bandhus expressly mentioned in the verses quoted above that the propositus must be a descendant of a common ancestor who is a member of the following fami lies, viz. (1) claimant&rsquo;s agnate family, (2) claimant&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s agnate family, (3) claimant&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s agnate family, (4) claimant&rsquo;s mo ther&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s agaate family. Following this opinion, it was held in Lowji u. Mithabai 2 Bom, L. R. 842 that the great-grandson of a sister is not an heir under Hindu Law, But this decision is against the definition of sapinda given by the Mit. apd is wrong. Vide Chinna v. Padmanabha 44 Mad, 121 pp. 128-130 for a reasoned and trenchant criticism of the re quirement of mutuality laid down without any discussion or explanation in the case of 6 Cal. 119 and the views of Sarvadhikari. It is to be regretted that owing to the ignorance of Sanskrit on the part of most judges that had to decide cases of Hindu Law, the opinions of individual learned authors like Mayne and Sarvad bikarl were followed without personal examination by judges of the authorities on which the opinions of authors were based.</li>

<p>not whether a female intervenes somewhere, but whether the person about whose sapiṇdaship a question is raised traces his descent to a common ancestor through his father or through his mother. In the P. C. case the claimant claimed sapinda. ship with the deceased through his mother, and it was rightly decided that he boing 6th from the common ancestor was not a bandhu. But to lay down as a universal rule that a bandhu in order to inherit under the Mit. should not be beyond five degrees from the common ancestor is against the definition of sapiṇda given by the Mit. itself and unduly narrows the express words of the Mit. The words of the P. C. &rsquo;the sapiṇda relationship, on which the heritable right of collaterals is founded, ceases in the case of the bhinna-gotra sapiṇda with the fifth degree from the common ancestor&rsquo; (L. R. 41 I. A, 290 at p. 312) are very generally expressed and are susceptible of the interpretation that they lay down the rule of five degrees even when the claimant claims 1458 relationship with the deceased through his own father. Some support for the Privy Council rule that sapinda relationship ceases with the 5th</p>
<ol start="1458">
<li>Vide Brij Mohan v. Kishun Lal (1938) A. L. J. 670 where the Allahabad High Court held that, even when the claimant traced sapinda relationship through his father, beritable bandhu relation ceases after the fifth degree. But in Kesar Singh v. Secretary of State for India 49 Mad. 652 at p. 690 it is said that, though in the P. C. decision there are some observations wbich at first sight imply that sapinda relationship of bandhus for inheritance ceases with the 5th degree in all cases, there is nothing to suggest that the Privy Council intended to do away with the wellknown distinction between bhinnagotra sapindas that claim relationship through their father and those tbat trace it through their mother. There is great diversity of view yet about what the P. C. meant in 41 I, A, 290. In Seelam Nagamma v. Reddam 1. L. R. (1943) Mad. 759 (F. B.) it was held that Dr. Sarvadhikari is wrong in his restrictions of heritable bandhus to the lines he propounds, that 54 All. 698 is wrongly decided and that 49 Mad. 652 lays down the correct law. On the other hand, in Hanmant v. Vasudev I. L. R. (1943) Bom. 465 it bas been held that the P. C. means that heri. table baadbug wbether claiming through the father or the mother must be within five degrees from the common ancestor. Vide Debi Das v. Mukat Behari I. L. R. (1943) All. p 131 which lays down several rules deducible from an examination of numerous cases. As an illustration of how the law of the succession of bandhus is in a bewildering state, the following two cases may be read. In Sakharam y. Ralkrishna 19 Bom, 739 (F.B.) it was held that a father&rsquo;a sister&rsquo;s son is to be preferred under the V. Mayūkba to the maternal uncle, but the P. C. decided in Balsubramanya v, Subbayya L. R. 65 I. A. 93 that the maternal uocle is entitled to preference over the father&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son.</li>

<p>Succession of bandhus</p>
<p>759</p>
<p>degree from the common ancestor in the case of bhinnagotra sapiṇdas may be found in the words of Mitramiśra in his commentary on Yāj. I. 5%, in the implication of the words of Kullūka 1489 on Manu V, 60 and in the remarks of the Balambhatti (p. 191 ). But this view is opposed to other weighty authorities such as the Nirnayasindhu and the Dharma sindhu.</p>
<p>The whole law about the succession of bandhus is in a confused state owing to conflicting decisions, but the P. O. has laid down certain propositions which may be set down here: (1) atmabandhus succeed before pitśbandhus and pitsbandhus before mātpbandhus ; (2) the nearer in degree in each class of bandhus is preferable to the more remote; (3) as between bandhus of the same class, the conferring of spiritual benefit would be a ground of preference, as the Viramitrodaya invokes that principle in several cases (and so the father&rsquo;s half sister&rsquo;s son would be preferred to the mother&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s son, though both are atmabandhus and of equal degree ); (4) if the above three rules fail, bandhus ex parte paterna (on the father&rsquo;s side ) succeed before bandhus ex parte materna (on the mother&rsquo;s side ); (5) the bandhu between whom and the propositus a lesser number of females intervenes is to be preferred. As a corollary of the 2nd rule it should follow that the descendants of the propositus would be preferred to ascendants and collaterals and that ban dhus of the same class that are descendants of a nearer line would succeed in preference to descendants of a remoter line though of the same class. But this last proposition has not yet been settled by the Privy Council. It has been, however, held in Debi Dus v. Mukat Behari I. L. R. (1943) All. 131 that a sister&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son should be preferred to the deceased&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s daugh ter&rsquo;s son, since the former belongs to a nearer line.</p>

<p>bandhus. One or two matters, however, call for remark. If the theory of spiritual benefit be strictly applied, many of those who would inherit as bandhus under the Mit. system would be barred from inheritance. For example, the daughter&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son 1459a or daughter&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son would be a heritable bandhu under the Mitākṣarā, but under the Dāyabhāga he would not be 80, as he offers no piṇda to the deceased or to any of the latter&rsquo;s ancestors. It is probably to obviate this unnatural and unjust consequence that the Dāyatattva refers to the text of Bṭ. (quoted above in n 1419) in which the word &lsquo;bāndhavāḥ&rsquo; occurs, remarks that the relatives of the father and mother of (the deceased ) inherit in the order of their nearness to the latter and quotes the three verses about the three classes of bandhus, indicating thereby that spiritual benefit is not the sole test, but that where it fails the test of blood relationship may be applied. 1460</p>
<p>Very elaborate rules have been evolved by Sarvadhikari in his Tagore Law Lectures on the Hindu Law of inheritance (2nd ed. of 1922, pp.571-640). The author devoted great industry, labour and ingenuity in evolving those rules. But one regrets to say that he raised a stupendous structure on very slippery and meagre foundations. And the pity of it is that many Judges have more or less followed his lead, though emphatic disapproval of his views, whereby the list of bandhus capable of inheriting has been very much restricted, has not been wanting. 1461 It is not possible to examine here in detail his reasonings and results. But the futility of much that he has evolved can and must be briefly shown,&rsquo; The only solid foundations that we have in the Mit. are: (1) the definition of sapiṇda given by it on Yāj. I. 53; (2) the remark that bandhus are bhinnagotra sapiṇdas (as contrasted with gotrajas); (3) that the bandhus of a man may be described under three classes; (4) that those that may be called atmabandhus succeed before those called pitsbandhus and these latter inherit before mātṛbandhus.

<p>Sarvadhilari&rsquo;s scheme of bandhu succession</p>
<p>761</p>
<p>the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses of Śālātapa or Baudhā. yapa are only illustrative. Therefore, the nine bandhus ex pressly mentiond should not have been used to exclude any one as not a heritable bandhu, as we have not got anywhere an exhaustive enumeration. Any one who satisfied the first two requirements stated above was a bandhu. Of the nine bandhus enumerated in the verses quoted above, none is connected by direct descent with the propositus, his father or mother; but one is a descendant of his paternal grandfather, one of his paternal great-grandfather, two of his maternal grandfather, two of his father&rsquo;s maternal grandfather, one of his mother&rsquo;s paternal grandfather, two of his mother&rsquo;s maternal grandfather. Sarva dhikari makes a different classification of these (p. 627) viz. * two are connected through the father, three through the mother, two through the paternal grandmother and two through the maternal grandmother&rsquo;. The whole trouble has been caused by this latter grouping. Instead of emphasizing lines of direct descent, he catches hold of females who are never spoken of in ancient works in connection with tracing descent ( except in the case of the mother of the man concerned ). If, because the illustrations given happen to be connected only with four lines of families, persons connected with the propositus through other lines are to be excluded, there is no reason why a man&rsquo;s own daughter&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son, son&rsquo;s daughter&rsquo;s son, sister&rsquo;s son, or sister&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s son should be held to be bandhus. They bear no close analogy to the atmabandhus enumerated by Śātātapa. But it is admitted by Sarvadhikari that they are atmabandhus. The terms atmabandhu, pitsbandhu and mātsbandhu are mere labels or devices to show nearness and preference among bandhus. Acc. to the V. Mayūkha1462 the words pitpbandhu and mātsbandhu are to be dissolved as sasthi-tatvuruṣa compounds ( pituḥ bāndhavaḥ</p>

<p>or matuh bandhavaḥ) i. e, according to it pitbandhus or mātpbandhus are bandhus of the father or mother and must also be bandhus of the propositus if they are to inherit. It is not known in what context the three verses quoted in the Mit. and other digests from Satātapa or Baudhāyana occurred. In Manu V. 81 It is laid down that one should observo mourning on the death of a pupil, sacrificial priest and bāndhavas for the duration of paksini. It is possible that the three verses only illustrate what is meant by bāndhavas in such a connection,</p>
<p>The Balambhatti ( vyavabāra p. 214 ) here also explains that females are included in the word &lsquo;bandhu&rsquo;, although the verses quoted speak of putrah&rsquo; only and the Bombay and Madras High Courts have allowed female bandhus to inherit, though in Madras the position assigned to female bandhus is</p>
<p>very much lower than in Bombay.</p>
<p>Strangers as Heirs-In default of even bandhus, the Mit. states 1463 that the teacher(of the veda) is the heir of the deceased, in default of the teacher the pupil (and relies on Ap. Dh. S II. 6. 14. 3) and that in default of pupil ā sabrahmacarin ( fellow student whose upanayana was performed by the same teacher as that of the deceased and who studied the veda under the same teacher ) 1464 inherits. In the absence of even a fellow student the wealth of a brahmana was to be given to some grotriya (a brāhmana learned in the Veda ) as laid down by Gaut. ( 28, 39) and in default of a śrotriya in the same village, as said by the Dāyabhāga XI. 6. 27, to any brāhmapa, since Manu (IX. 188-189) says, &lsquo;in the absence of all (heirs ), brāhmaṇas that have studied the three vedas, that are pure and restrained, take the wealth; in this way dharma does not suffer : the rule is that the wealth of a brahmana should never be taken by the king&rsquo;. Nār, 1465 ( dāyabhāga, 51-52 ) is to the same effect. To the game</p>

This direction of so many ancient sages has not been respected in modern times. 1467 Manu (IX. 189) and Bṛ. 1468 (S, B, E. vol. 33, p. 380 verse 67) say that the wealth of kṣatriyas, vaiśyas and śūdras oscheats to the king in default of heirs up to a fellow student. When the king takes by escheat heirless property he has to set apart a portion of the wealth of the deceased for the maintenance of his concubines and servants and for the per formance of his funeral rites and sraddhas as stated by Kat. 1469 931. Kaut. IIL 5, Nār.(dāyabhaga,52) provide that the king (when he takes heirlege property ) should provide maintenance for his women and both tle Mit. and the V. Mayūkha explain that the word&rsquo; women&rsquo; stands for avaruddhastri (exclusively kept concubine) and not for his wives ( who would succeed as heirs and then there would be no escheat), because the word * patni&rsquo; is not employed in the verse. These verses of Nār. and Kāt. are the foundation of the right to maintenance of a concubine against the heirs of the deceased paramour in modern times. 1970</p>

<p>Yaj. (IL. 137) states a special rule 1471 which is an exception to the general rule of inheritance laid down in II. 135-136 vie. &lsquo;(the heirs) who take the wealth of a forest hermit, a yati (ascetic), a (perpetual) vedio student are in order the ( vedic) teacher, a virtuous pupil, one who is looked upon as a brother and belongs to the same order! According to the Mit. the heirs mentioned are to be taken in the reverse order of the words of the text i. e. the ācārya ( who is mentioned first among the three heirs ) is to be taken as the heir of the last of the three mentioned in the first half of the verse, so that the teacher, good pupil and the person looked upon as brother are respec tively the heirs of the perpetual student, the ascetic and the forest hermit. According to the Dāyabhāga also the reverse order has to be taken, but it says that the wealth of the forest hormit, yati and perpetual student is taken respectively by one looked upon as brother, a worthy pupil and teacher, but that in the absence of these, any one who is in the same āśrama as the deceased may take it. According to the Madanaratna 1172 the order of heirs is the direct one, that is, the teacher, good pupil and accepted brother take the wealth of the forest hermit, ascetic and perpetual student, since the Viṣṇu Dh. S. (17. 15-16) expressly says so.

<p>Yajñavalkya&rsquo;s words apply only to the former, that if the latter ( upakurvāṇa ) leaves any wealth of his own it is taken by his mother, father and the other heirs. The Mit. further says that a worthy pupil is one who is capable of studying the philosophical parts of the Veda, of understanding them and of acting up to them, that a badly behaved pupil will not succeed, so also a badly conducted teacher shall not succeed. The Mit. explains that Yāj. III. 47 allowed a forest hermit to accumulate materials that will be enough to meet his needs for a day, a month or six months or a year and so he may on his death leave some wealth. Similarly, though an ascetic was required by Gautama ( U. 10 ) to make no accumulation of wealth, yet even an ascetic requires clothes to cover his body, he has his sandals and books on Yoga and the like ; and so also the perpetual student requires these.</p>
<p>· The heirs enumerated above succeed to persons in those religious orders in priority of their kindred. It has been held that members of the three twice-born classes alone can be ascetics with the result that their pupils inherit and not the kindred and that in the case 1473 of sūdra ascetics their kindred succeed unless some usage to the effect that a pupil inherits is proved.

<p>reunion in law, as sald by the Sm. C. II. p. 302 and Vivadar candra 174 p. 82. The Vivadacandra quoting Viṣṇupurana says that reunion may be implied from a course of conduct, even though an express agreement cannot be proved. There is a divergence of views as to who can reunite. The Mit., the Dayabhaga 1175, the Sm. C. hold, literally construing a verse of Br. (S. B. E. 33 p. 381 verse 72 ), that a member of a joint family when once divided can reunite only with his father, brother or paternal uncle, but not with any other relation (such as a paternal uncle&rsquo;s son or paternal grand-father), while the V. C. (p. 157), the V. Mayūkha (p. 146), the V. P. (p. 533) hold that the members expressly mentioned by Bç, are only illustrative and that a person may reunite with any member who was a party to the original partition. A reunited person is called sainsęsta or saṛsrstin 1476 ( who has reunited wealth). The subject of reunion has a comparatively ancient history. Gaut. 28. 26 states the general rule that on the death of a reunited co-parcener the surviving reunited member succeeds to the share of the deceased. Kaut. (III.5p. 160) states 1477 that those, who live together though they may have no ancestral estate or do so after dividing their ancestral estate, may divide their reunited estate again in equal shares. Manu IX. 210 (=Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 18. 41) is similar to it.</p>

<p>Devolution after reunion</p>
<p>767</p>
<p>The verses of Yaj. (II. 138-139 ) 1478 on succession to a deceased reunited person are understood by the Mit. to be an exception to the rules contained in Yaj. II. 135-136 laying down that the wife and others inherit the property of a person dying sonlegs. Therefore it follows that where a person reunites with his brother and then dies leaving a son not reunited with him, it is the son who will inherit and not the brother, though reunited. But if A separates from two sons B and C of whom B reunites with him and C does not and then A dies, then the reunited son B succeeds to A&rsquo;s interest and C takes nothing. This is expressly stated by the Vivādacandra p. 85 that relies on the Smṛtisāra 1479. The two verses of Yāj. (II. 138-139 ) are variously read and interpreted by the Mit. and other commentators and it is not possible nor quite necessary to set out all these readings and explanations. Acc. to the Mit the two verses mean: &lsquo;in the case of a deceased reunited per son, the surviving ) reunited member should give ( to the posthumous son of the former ) the share of the deceased but may take it himself if there is no son ( but only a wife ); but from among the reunited brothers, the full brother, if reunited, should similarly give to the posthumous son of the deceased the latter&rsquo;s share and ( if there be no son ) he should take it himself to the exclusion of reunited half brothers; a re united half brother takes the wealth of the deceased reunited member ( dying sonless ) and not another half brother who is not reunited; a full brother, though not reunited, may take the wealth along with a half brother who is reunited but the latter will not alone be entitled&rsquo;. In this interpreta tion the word &lsquo;asamsýsti&rsquo; in the latter half of II. 139 has to be taken in two connections, once with anyodaryaḥ&rsquo; in the first half and then again with &lsquo;saṁsrstaḥ&rsquo; ( in the 2nd half). This last word is to be understood in two senses, viz.</p>

<p>(1) full brother (with the preceding word asamsrsti) and (2) * reunited&rsquo; (with the word &lsquo;anyamātsjah&rsquo;). Further, aco, to the Mit. we have to understand &rsquo;eva&rsquo; after. anyamātsjah&rsquo;. Aparārka (p. 748) reads differently and he, Viśvarūpa and Srikaramiśra (Dayabhāga XI. 5-16 ) explain that a full brother though not reunited takes the whole estate and not the half brother though reunited with the deceased. The V. Mayūkha differs from the Mit. when it says that the word apurczsya (of one dying sonless) is not to be understood with Yāj. (II. 138). It derives two propositions from the first half of Yaj. II. 138, viz (1) the wealth of one dying reunited is taken by tho surviving reunited member of members; (2) in a competition between reunited full brother and reunited half-brother, the former takes the whole. The latter half of II. 138 is an independent sentence (and not joined with the preceding half as the Mit, understands) and applies where a reunited member dies leaving a wife who is pregnant but that fact being unknown the other reunited members divide the estate. In such a case if a son is born the surviving members should hand over to the son the share of the deceased reunited member. But if no such son is born then the survivors may take the estate. In II. 139 the Mayūkha holds that the words &ldquo;anyodarya&rsquo; and &rsquo; anyamātsja&rsquo; are not restricted to brothers only, but apply to a paternal uncle or his sons or other persons who were reunited, because their mother is also different from the mother of the deceased. The Daya bhāga discusses Yāj II. 138-139 under the topic of succession to the separate property of a sonless man and its treatment of succession to reunited property is very meagre ( vide XII ), 1480 The V. P. p.-533 notices this and levels against Jimūtavāhana the criticism that he got confused. Aparārka (pp. 748–749) seems to be of the same opinion as the Dāyabhāga. The V. P. follows the Mit. and criticizes the explanation given by Śrīkara, Sm. C. and others ( pp. 535-538). It says that the texts of Saṅkha, Narada and others conflict with the text of Yāj. II. 135 and that the order of heirs as to a •reunited co-parcener is based on express texts and not on Yāj, II. 135 1481 or logical reasoning. Accord ing to the V. P. the order of succession to a deceased reunited</p>

The V. Mayū. kha gives the order as follows: (1) son if reunited; (2) son not reunited, though there may be reunited members (other than a gon); (3) the parents if reunited in preference to other reunited persons (other than a son); (4) full brother if re united; (5) full brother not reunited and half brother reunited; (6) half brothers and uncles, if reunited; (7) other male mem bers reunited (in preference to wife though she be reunited); (8) wife if she be reunited ; (9) full sister (or daughter accord ing to another reading );1482 (10) any other sapiṇda who is nearest. It is to be noted that Manu IX. 212 prescribes a peculiar rule of succession for reunited co-parceners viz. that full brothers (not rounited) and full sisters of the deceased reunited co-parcener equally inherit along with half brothers that are reunited the wealth of the deceased. This verse of Manu has been variously explained by Kullūka, Apararka p. 749, Sm, C. (II pp. 304-305 ), Nilakantha, Vivādacandra (p. 83) and others.</p>
<p>It may be stated here that cases of reunion come very rarely before the courts.</p>
