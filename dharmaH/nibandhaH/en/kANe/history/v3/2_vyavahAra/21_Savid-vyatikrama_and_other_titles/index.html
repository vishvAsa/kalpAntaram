  <p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
<p>TT</p>
<p>SAMVID-VYATIKRAMA AND OTHER TITLES</p>
<p>( Violation of compacts or conventions)</p>
<p>Nār. ( XIII. 1 ) employs the expression samayasyānapākarma. Manu VIII. 5 employs the first expression. Manu (VIII. 218-219) has both names in view, when he says &lsquo;I shall now declare the rules applicable to those who violate samayas (conventions ). He who having entered into a compact (samvid) under (the sanction of) an oath with the inhabitants of a village or a district or with a group of traders or other persons breaks it through greed should be banished from the kingdom by the king.&rsquo; In Ap. Dh. S. I. 1. 1.2 and II. 4, 8. 13 the word</p>
<p>samaya &rsquo; 852 is employed in the sense of &lsquo;convention or accept od doctrine&rsquo;. The same word is also used in the sense of &lsquo;agreement&rsquo; as in Yaj. I. 61 ( gāndharvaḥ samayānmithaḥ). In this title it means the acceptance of a certain rule or convent ion arrived at by many&rsquo;, as explained by 853 Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 219. It signifies a local or caste usage or convent ion made by groups of people ( such as guilds and corporations ) binding on all members that form or join the several groups. The Amarakosa holds that ācāra and sarvid are among the several meanings of samaya. Medhātithi explains that, if the inhabitants of a village come to a decision that they would oppose the inhabitants of a neighbouring village who were indulging in grazing their cattle in the pastures of the former village or diverting the watercourses and that if in doing so there was a riot or a suit were filed before the king, all should</p>

<p>be of one mind, that any one of those who encouraged this decision would be liable to be punished if he backed out of it through some inducement offered by the headman of the other village. Nār. XIII. 1 explains that samaya means the rules (or conventions ) settled among heretics, naiyamas 854 and the like. Yaj. II. 192 and Nar. XIII. 2 provide that the conventions of guilds, naigamas, heretics, srenis, pigas, ganas and in towns and districts should be enforced by the king and their traditional mode of conducting their business should be protected. Some remarks have already been made on guilds and corporations above (pp.156-57 notes 196-198). Vide also H. of Dh. vol. II. pp. 66-69 for the guilds and corporations and the meanings of words like $reni, pūga, gana eto. Some further informa tion is added here. The Sm. C. (II. p. 223) has a very 855 interes ting note illustrating the various conventions of several groups and its remarks are copied verbatim by the V. P. pp. 332-333. It says: &lsquo;Even heretics have certain rules made for the benefit of their monasteries. Among naigamas there is a practice that those who disregard messages brought by servants wearing a specific jacket (as a uniform) should be fined. Srenis are guilds of craftsmen such as weavers. They have rules that certain articles are to be sold only by a certain guild and by no other. Pūgas are groups of elephant riders and horse riders.&rsquo; Vrāta is defined by Kāt. as a body of persons armed with various weapons, while the Mahabhasya on Panini V.2.21 (uratena jivati) explains it as a group of men of several castes and several occupations who make a living by relying on their formidable bodies&rsquo;. Acc. to the Mit. heretics are those like the Bauddhas who do not regard the Veda as authoritative, Gapa means, acc.</p>

<p>to Mit. an assemblage of armed persons subsisting by follow ing one occupation&rsquo;, while Kāt. (680) says it is a corporation of brahmanas. In the Rajat. II. 132 reference is made to corpora tions of purohitas at temples and tirthas ( sacred places ). The Sm. C. states that among pūgas and vrātas there is a convention that they must go to battle all together and not separately. Among ganas there is a usage that the lobes of the ear (of a child) are to be pierced on the 5th day or in the fifth year from birth. Among mahājanas in a settlement of brāhmaṇas there is a convention that a brāhmaṇa repairing to them for collecting fees to be paid to his teacher (at the close of Vedic study ) should be honoured (i. e, should be paid some contribution). In certain districts there is a usage that either the seller or the buyer should keep in his hand it of the price (probably for finding out whether the article is useful for the purpose in hand and resiling from the bargain if it is not ). In forts or capitals there is a rule that corn taken out of it by a person with him when going out elsewhere should not be sold by him. In villages there is a rule that in pastures no digging would be allowed. In the hamlets inhabited by abhiras there is a convention that for adultery by a male or female there is to be no fine. It does credit to the ancient writers on dharmaśāstra that they were tolerant enough to require the king, whatever his own religious persuasion might be, to honour and enforce the usages of even herstice among themselves. The only requirement was that the enforcement of their usages must not be opposed to the interest of the country or the capital and must not cause commotion and must not be plainly immoral 856 (Nār, XIII. 4-5 and 7 and Medhātithi on Manu VIII. 220). Yāj. (II. 188–192 ) lays down the following rules : there should be a committee of two, three or five, acc. to Bṛ. ) 857 to look after the business of the guilds &amp;c. ( called kāryacintaka ) who should be religious, pure, not covetous and all members should carry out what they decide upon; when the committee members approach the king on some business of their guild he should bestow on them gifts and</p>

(677) states the general rule that whatever is obtained (by the committee or advisers of the group ) or is saved by them or whatever debts are incurred by them for their group and whatever they obtain through the king&rsquo;s favour should be shared equally by all (members of the group). Kat. ( 674-675 ) provides that whatever debt was professedly incurred by the committee for the group but was misappropriated by them or applied to their individual purposes must be paid by them and that those who subsequently join the groups already formed become equally entitled to the property and liable for the debts previously acquired or incurred. Manu VIII. 220 and Br. (S. B, E. vol. 33 p. 348 v. 14 ) provide a fine of six niṣkas of four suvarpas each (or six niṣkas and four suvarṇan) for him who falls out with his associates. Kat. (671) provides that that member of a group) who opposes what is reasonable, who gives no soope to (i. e. obstructs or persistently interrupts ) a speaker (in a meeting of the group ) or who speaks absurdly should be made to pay the first amercement. Yāj. II. 187 prescribes forfeiture of all property and banishment for him who misappropriates the property of the group or corporation or who violates the conventions made by the group (or the king ). As stated by the Mit, this and other sentences depended upon the nature and gravity of the offence and the capacity of the offender 859</p>
<p>Krayavikrayānusaya (repentance after purchase or sale ). Manu VIII. 222 and Kaut. II. 15 regard this as one title of law. But Nār. (XI and XII ) splits this into two titles viz. vikriyāsampradana (non-delivery of a thing after it is sold for a price ) and bitvārusaya (repentance after buying). Manu states the general rule that whenever a person after buying</p>

<p>or selling anything repents of having done so, be inay return or take back that thing within ten days. Nār. XI. 2 states that property is of two kinds in this world viz. movable and immovable and that all property is designated as panya (saleable ) in rules about purchase and sale. According to Yaj. 11. 254, Nār. XI. 4-5, Viṣṇu Dh, S. V. 127 860), if a man sells property and does not deliver it to the purchager, he should be made to deliver it to the parchaser together with profits (between the time of sale and delivery ) and if it is movable together with the price of profits arising 8 from it ( such as milk in the case of a cow). Vigṇu Dh. S. V. 128 prescribes a fine of 100 panas against the vendor. Kaut. III. 15 prescribes a fine of 12 paṇas against the vendor who after selling a thing does not deliver it and also against a buyer who having pur chased does not take delivery of it, except when the thing itself is detective or is lost by act of king or theft or by fire or flood or unless the transaction was for inadequate price or brought about in distress. 862 If the article sold is not deliver ed by the vendor after demand by the vendee and it is injured, destroyed by fire or stolen, the loss will fall on the vendor (Nar. XI. 6, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. V. 129, Yāj. II. 256 ). These rules apply when the vendor does not feel repentance for having sold the thing, but if he feels repentance then Manu VIII. 222 will apply and the vendor may pay back the price and recover the article within ten days 863 from the sale. Kāt. (684) provides the same rule. No one, either buyer or vendor, can rescind the sale after ten days and if any one uses force in</p>

<p>recovering the article sold or bought after that period the king should fine him 600 panas. Manu VII. 228 extends these rules about repentance and recovery within ten days to all transactions whatever. Kāt. ( 685 ) prescribes that the period of ten days for repentance is allowed to vendors and vendees only in the case of land, and that the period is 12 days when the parties to sale of land are sapiṇdas of one another and that in other cases the period is even shorter. 864 Yāj. II. 257, Nār. XI. 7-8, Bṛ. (8. B. E. vol. 33 p. 350 verse 4) provide that when a vendor having sold a thing to one man for a price received sells it to another or having concealed the defects of an article sells it as free from defects he should be made to return double the price to the purchaser and a fine equal to double the price to the king. $65 The above rules apply where the purchaser has paid the price, but if there is a mere agree ment and no price is paid, then the vendor or vendee is guilty of no wrong if he resiles from the bare agreement to sell or buy unless they have made an express stipulation that the agree ment cannot be rescinded (Nār. XI. 10). When at the time of the agreement for sale, the vendee pays something by way of ear pest, then if the sale goes off through the fault of the vendor, the latter has to return to the vendee double of the earnest; 866 but if the purchaser does not finally take it he loses the thing and also the earnest. Nār. XII. 1 prescribes that when a vendee after having purchased a thing for a price repents of the pur chase that is the title of law called &lsquo;rescission of purchase.&rsquo; Nār. XII. 2 prescribes that if the purchaser thinks that he has made a bad bargain he may return the thing purchased to the vendor on the same day in an undamaged condition (and may receive back the price paid); but if he returns it on the 2nd or 3rd day after the purchase (including the day of purchase ) he will have to lose respectively one-thirtieth or one-fifteenth of the price and after the third day he cannot return the thing at all (Nār. XII. 3), But Yaj. II. 177 and Nār. XII. 5-6 lay down</p>

It must be supposed that these verses contain exceptions to the general rule in Manu VIII. 22% cited above. Kaut. (III. 15) allows only one night, three nights, five nights and seven nights for repentance to traders, husbandmen, cowherds, the mixed castes and higher castes and provides that where the articles sold are perishable a very short time only may be allowed. The above rules apply only when the purchaser made no examination at the time of purchase. Nār. 867 XII. 4 and Bṛ. (S. B. E. vol. 33 p. 350 verse 3) recommend that a purchaser should himself closely examine an article before buying it and also show it to others in order to find out its defects and good qualities and provide that when he has approved of an article after close examination he cannot return it to the vendor. Vyāga provides that hides, fuel, bricks, yarn, grain, intoxicants, fluids, gold, inferior metals (like lead and tin) and other wealth should be carefully examined then and there i. e. when once bought after close examination none of these can be returned even if some defect 868 is found therein. Nār. (XII, 5-6) cited above contains exceptions to this. Nār. XII. 7 gives an example of a purchase being not liable to be rescinded when &amp; defective article is purchased with open eyes viz. a worn garment which is soiled with dirt and is in ragged condition cannot be returned to the vendor if it was in that state at the time of the purchase i. e. the maxim&rsquo;caveat emptor&rsquo; applies. If a purchaser does not take delivery of the thing sold to him, the vendor may sell it again to another 869 and if the thing is lost through aot of God or the king the loss falls on the buyer alone (Yaj.

(705–706) lays down a novel rule to find out what is adequate or inade quate price. What a71 is decided by the neighbours assembled together, who know (the land &amp;o. and its value) and who are afraid of committing sin, as the price of fields, gardens, houses and the like, of bipeds and quadrupeds, is declared to be the proper price; a price which is less or more than it by one-eighth is declared to be improper; what is sold for an improper price may be annulled even after a hundred years. Kat. (704) states that when the owner of a field absconds to gether with the surety 872 for the payment of the land tax, the judges of the court may order a sale for recovery of the tax and that such a sale may be set aside up to ten years and a com promise or exchange up to three generations, if it is inequitable. Bhāradvāja provides that when taxes are not paid both by the tax-payer and his surety even when called upon to do so, then the king may order a charge on the land or sale of the land.</p>
<p>Uktalābha is defined as a conditional sale, where a man borrows only a portion of the proper price of a land and stipulates that he would return the money on a certain day and that if he did not do so his ownership over the land would come to an end. 873 Kāt.

Kat: (71%) further 875 prescribes that the unpaid purchase money carries compound interest after demand if no time is fixed for payment, but, if a time is fixed, then only the balance has to be paid up to the end of that period. Bp. provides that in all sales, the sale deed should mention the wells and trees (on the land), the water and ways and that the crops, trees and fruits, wells, tanks and house standing on the land sold would belong to the vendor if they are not put down in the deed of sale, 876 According to Harita the rules of sales are to be extended to exchanges. 877</p>
<p>From the Rājatarangini VI. 41 it appears that a fraudulent purchaser, who, by means of the heavy bribe of 1000 dinārus, induced the officially authorized scribe to include a well in the sale of a house when it was intended to be excluded from it, was banished from the country by the king, his property being confiscated and given over to the cheated vendor.</p>

<p>Definitions of sale, exchange &amp;c.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>The Vyavahāranirṇaya, after quoting Bṛ. and Vyāsa, very lucidly explains what is meant by sale, purchase, exchange &amp;o. Gold and the like which a man desires to render or pay is called price, while land, house and the like are said to be &lsquo;panya&rsquo; (saleable thing ). Purchage means acoeptance of a thing pre coded by the offering of a price (either paid or agreed to be paid); sale is the acceptance of a price preceded by the offering of a saleable thing. Parivștti or parivartana is the acceptance of an article for an article of the same kind; if there is a disparity in value between the two articles exchanged the exchange is called &rsquo; rwvakraya &lsquo;; when there is an exchange of two articles of different kinds but of the same value it is called vininaya. 878 The Vyavahāranirṇaya makes elaborate provi sions for sale of land at the order of the king for non-payment of land tax. It quotes Prajapati (p. 350 ) to the effect that the purchaser at such a sale must offer half or at least one-fourth of the real price of the field and that the original owner could get back his property sold for the royal dues by paying the full price to the purchaser up to three generations. Other elaborate rules on the same subject are passed over here for reasons of space. These provisions indicate that ownership in cultivated fields belonged to individuals and that the State had only the right to levy taxes. Vide H. of Dh, vol. II. pp. 865-869 and Kāt, quoted above ( on p. 196 ) for a discussion of the theory of the State&rsquo;s ownership of all lands. Taking into consideration the Pūrvamimāṁsā texts, the Vyavahāramayūkha and the verses of Kāt, and others it appears that the State was deemed to be the owner of all lands as a general proposition, but that where individuals or bodies of persons had been in long possession of lands that they cultivated, the ownership of the State was qualified and restricted only to the recovery of a tax or share</p>

<p>of crops and that individuals and groups that had cultivated lands in their possession were regarded practically as owners of the land subject to the liability to pay land tax and to the right of the State to sell the land for non-payment of tax. The Vyavahāranirṇaya quotes Bp. and another smrti text that sūdras, persons excommunicated for grave sins (patita), cāṇḍālas and desperate characters cannot be allowed to possess the lands of a brābmaṇa by sale, partition or in lieu of wages; 879 the same work further quotes Vyāsa, Bhāradvāja and Br. that when land is sold there is a right of pre-emption in favour of full brothers, sapiṇdas, samanodakas, sagotras, neighbours, creditors and one&rsquo;s co-villagers in order. 880</p>
<p>Gifts of immovables were looked upon in very ancient times with disfavour, though they were made even in the times of the Upaniṣads. Vide H, of Dh. vol. II pp. 740-41. But sales of land must have been rarer still in ancient times owing to the patriarchal and joint family systems. The Mit. on Yaj. II. 114 quotes a verse forbidding the sale of immovable property : 881 but sales of lands are mentioned in many copperplate grants. Vide Paharpur plate grant of Gupta year 159 i. e. 478-79 A. D. in E.

<p>Ancient procedure for sale of land</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>joint families or by the village community or by the king and there was a fixed procedure when land was to be sold, that the purchaser approached the District Officers who consulted the pustapālas that kept a record of titles and that the villa gers and headmen were consulted and asked to mark off the land to be sold. It appears that the smṣtis recommended that sales should be clothed in the formalities of gifts, probably because gifts were frequent and sales were not. A smrti quoted by the Mit. (on Yaj. II. 114) states land passes (i. e. is trans ferred) with the assent of the villagers, the agnatic relations, the neighbours, the co-sharers and with the offering of gold and water.&rsquo; The Mit. explains that these 882 are not absolutely neces sary formalities of a sale, but that they are recommended for the sake of greater caution and convenience, that the absent of the villagers is to be secured for the publication of the transaction of sale, as a text says that acceptance, particularly of im movables, should be made openly, that the neighbours&rsquo; assent should be secured for preventing boundary disputes, that the assent of agnates and co-sharers is desired for making it easy to complete the transaction, that it does not follow that without the assent of these the sale of land is not valid or complete. Water and gold are to be offered because gifts being highly commended, a sale should be clothed outwardly with the same formalities. Vide Dr. P. N. Sen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hindu Jurisprudence&rsquo; pp. 76–78 for the opposite procedure of the ancient Roman Law that gifts were to be clothed with the formalities of sale. For water and gold in the case of gifts vide above under dattāpradānika.</p>

Manu VIII. 230 says that during the day the responsibility for the safety of the cattle rests on the herdsman and during the night on the owner provided they are in the latter&rsquo;s house. When there is no express agreement as to wages Nār. IX, 10 and Bs. (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verse 19 ) prescribe that a cowherd 883 will get as his wages all the milk of the cows tended by him on every eighth day plus a heifer (two years old) every year out of every one hundred cows tended by him or a milch cow with her calf every year for every two hundred cows looked after by him. Manu VIII. 231 provides another method when no wages are fixed by agreement viz. a hired herdsman, who is paid with milk, may milk as hire the best cow out of ten with the consent of the owner. It is the duty of the cowherd to struggle as much as in him lies to protect the cows from accidents and if he is unable to do so he must quickly inform the owner (Nār. IX. 12). Bṛ. (S. B. E. 33 p. 346 verge 20) states 884 that the cowherd shall save cattle from the danger of worms (or reptiles), robbers, tigers and from caverns and pits and that he should try to protect them to the best of his ability, should call out for help or inform his master. If the herdsman does not struggle to protect the cows, nor raise a hue and cry nor inform his master he must make good the value of the cow lost and must pay a fine to the king (Nār. IX. 13). Manu VIII. 232 and 235, Yaj. II. 164-165, Viṣṇu Dh. S. V. 885 137-138, Nār. (IX, 14-15) provide that if a cow or other domestic animal strays or is killed by worms (or reptiles) or slain by dogs (and wild animals) or dies by falling into a pit or by any negligent act of the herdsman, he himself shall make good the loss, if he did not exert bimself to prevent this happening or if goats and sheep are surrounded by wolves and carried away while the herdsman does not hasten to their help he shall bear the res ponsibility for the loss. In these cases the herdsman has also</p>

<p>Liabilities of the herdsman</p>

<p>to pay a fine of 123 panas 38 to the king (Yaj. II. 165). Ap. Dh. S. II. 11. 28. 6 makes 887 the herdsman liable to pay the price if an animal in his charge dies or is lost (by theft &amp;c.). Manu VIII. 233, 236, Nār. IX. 16, Vyāsa state exceptions to the above viz. where an animal is carried away 888 by robbers though the herdsman raised a cry, he would not be liable to make good the loss provided he gave information to his master at the proper time (immediately after the animal is carried away) and proper place; or when the herdsman himself is seized or the village is attacked or the country is invaded, the herdsman would not be liable for loss or seizure of any animal under his charge; and also where, while the herd is grazing in a proper order near a forest, a wolf suddenly kills an animal. Manu VIII. 234, Nār. IX. 17 state that when cattle die through act of God or king or die without any fault of kis while in charge of a herdsman, he has to free himself from liability or from the suspicion of himself having 859 carried away surreptitiously the animal by producing before his master their ears, skin, tails, bladders, tendons and yellow bile or by showing their limbs (viz, their characteristic marks). Vyāsa states that if a herdsman, who has received his wages, abandons cattle in an untenanted forest and moves about in the village he should be fined by the king.89</p>
<p>Yaj. II. 166 provides that a portion of land should be set apart at the discretion of the villagers or that of the king as pasture for cows. Manu VIII. 237, Yāj. II. 167 prescribe</p>

<p>that on all sides round a village, a kharvata and a town an uncultivated space for pastures (between it and the fields) shall be kept respectively of 100, 200, 400 dhanu: 591 in extent. Kāt. (666) prescribes that the owner of a field (which is near a forest) should construct a high paling before the crops have grown; for animals (or deer) when they have once tasted the sweet 892 ( crops ) can be warded off with difficulty. Manu VIII, 239 = ( Matsya 227.25), Nār. XIV. 41 prescribe that a hedge should be constructed for a field that is near a public way so high that a camel cannot look inside over it or a borge or cattle cannot jump over or so thick that &amp; dog or boar should not be able to thrust its head inside it through holes. Manu VIIL 238 ( = Matsyapurāṇa 227. 26 ), Yaj. II. 162, Nār. XIV. 40 provide that if a field situated near a village or a pasture or near a public road is not protected by a hedge and cattle straying into it cause loss, the herdsman is not to be held guilty. It is provided by Ap. Dh. S. 11. 11. 28. 5, Manu VIII. 240, Nar. XIV. 28, Kāt. 664-665 that if cattle enter into fields, 893 parks or pastures that are situated near a village or a publio road and are enclosed by a hedge, they may be seized or beaten off, the herdsman is to be fined (a hundred paṇas ). Yaj. II. 159-161, Manu VIII. 241, Nār. XIV. 28-29, Kāt, 667 and others lay down that where cattle enter fields ( not near a village or road) and cause loss, the herdsman is to be fined or whipped, the owner of the cattle is to make good the loss and</p>

<p>A e: is 4 cubits (or about 6 feet). Manu VIII. 237 ordains having a space of 300 dhanus round a city; it also says that the space round a village for pastures sbould be three throws of samyā. Ap. Dh, S. 1. 3. 9. 6 and 23 employ the expression TUTATE for stating distance. 1947 means yoke-pia (gu ). Vide p. 145 note 185 above for dhanus and other measures of distance. In E. I. vol.

<p>Fines for cattle straying among crops</p>
<p>501</p>
<p>pay the fine prescribed and the fines vary 8. g. Ya. II. 159 prescribes fines of 2, 4 and 8 māṣas respectively when a goat or a cow or a she-buffalo strays and causes logs of crops, while Kat. (667) prescribes only pana in the case of cows and sheep and ; in the case of she-buffaloes. Vide Gaut. XII. 19-22 and Kaut. III. 10 also. Those who purposely set cattle to eat or destroy crops were to be punished as thieves (Nār. XIV. 34).</p>
<p>Ancient India entertained tender feelings for certain animals and in certain circumstances. Nār. XIV. 30, Yāj. II. 163, Manu VIII. 242, Kaut. III. 10 894 and Uśanas provide that cows within ten days after calving, a stud bull, a horse, an elephant, animals let loose in honour of ancestors or deities, and cattle that have strayed from the herd or that have no herdsman to look after them and have met with an accident are to be warded off when causing harm to crops, but the owner is not to be fined. Usanas 895 states that the reason for this leniency is that horses and elephants are protectors of people. Apararka (p. 771 ) explains that this exemption applies only to the king&rsquo;s horses and elephants. Uśanas adds that (owners of) cows should not be fined when they cause some loss at the time of festivals and brāddhas. The great veneration for cows led Uśanas to lay down that he who requires the owner of a cow to re-imburse the loss of crops that are eaten up or destroyed by a cow will find that his pit?s and the gods do not receive the offerings made 896 by him. This is explained by the Par. M. III. p. 385 as referring to crops in fields near a village not enclosed by a hedge and by the Madanaratna to crops eaten at the time of śrāddha. Br., Yāj. II. 161 and Nār. XIV. 38 require the owner of the cow to re-imburse the owner of the crops for the loss as settled by the neighbours. Vide under &lsquo;steya&rsquo; for cases in which there is no offence of theft even if a person takes certain things belonging to another without his permission.</p>
