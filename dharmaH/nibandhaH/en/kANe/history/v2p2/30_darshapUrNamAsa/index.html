<p>DARSA-PŪRŅAMĀSA 2272</p>
<p>The Darsapārṇamāsa gaorifice is the pattern or archetype (pra. krti) of all other iṣtis (which are called vikṛtis or modifications). The srauta sūtras therefore describe first the Darsapūrpamāga at length, though in the order of time agnyadhana comes first. Asy. II. 1. 1 says that all iṣçis, sacrifices in which an animal is offered and those in which somis offered are explained by the Paurṇamāsa iṣti. According to Ap. III. 14. 11-13 &amp; person, after he sets up the tbree fires, bas to perform the Darsapūrna māsa throughout his life ( till he becomes a samnyasin) or for thirty years ( after which he may stop ) or till he becomes very old (and unable to perform the rite ).3213</p>
<p>The word &rsquo; amāvāsya&rsquo; literally means &rsquo;the day when (the sun and the moon) dwell or are together.&rsquo; It is that tithi (day) on which both the sun and the moon are the nearest to each otber, while paurṇamāsi is the tithi on which the sun and the moon are at the greatest distance from each other.&rsquo; Pūrṇamāsa means that moment when the moon is full.&rsquo; Darga has the same sense as amāvisya. Darsa is taken to mean &rsquo;the day on wbich the moon is seen only by the sun and by no one else.&rsquo; Darsa (m) and pūrnamāsa (m) secondarily mean the rites that are performed on the amāvāsyā and the paurpamāsi respec tively.3974 An iṣti means a sacrifice in which the sacrificer employs four priests,</p>

<p>A aketob of the darsapūrnamāsa iṣti is given below princi pally based upon the srautasutras of Satyaṣadha and Asvaldyana.</p>
<p>One who has performed agnyadheya should begin the performance of darsapūrpamāsa on the first Bull Moon day after it. The iṣti on the Full-moon day may occupy two days, but all the actions to be performed in it can be compressed into one day. * If extended over two days it is performed on the full moon day and the pratipad (the first day of the dark half that follows the Full Moon day), the former being oalled upavasatha day 1398 and the latter yajaniya day. On the upavasatha day agnyan vādhana (offering fuel-stioks into fire) and paristarana aro performed in the case of the pūrnamāga rite and on the yajaniya day the rest is performed. If it is the first pūrpamāsa iṣti or the first darśa iṣti, then the saorificer has to perform the Anvārambhaniya iṣti, which is briefly described in the note below, 1973</p>
<p>On the morning of the full moon day the sacrificer, after the performance of bis daily agnihotra, sitting on a seat of darbhas to the west of the gārbapatya, holding kusa grass in his band and performing prāpāyāma and accompanied by his wife, makes a saṅkalpa (resolve ) As noted below.378 Then he says to the four priests viz., adhvaryu, brahma, hotf and Agnidhra</p>

<p>&ldquo;I choose thee, so and so by name, as my adhvaryu, as my brahma, as my hotṛ and as my dgnidhra.&rsquo; The adhvaryu takes fire from the gārbapatya, carries it to the dhavanlya mound and also to the dakṣiṇāgni mound and places a fuel-stiok with its end to the east on the Abavaniya with the verse &lsquo;mamagne Varco &lsquo;<em>979 (Rg. X. 128. 1, Tai. 8. IV. 7. 14. 1). The adhvaryu and sacrifioer perform japa by muttering three verses</em>280 (from Tai, Br. III. 7. 4 set out in Sat. I. 2. p. 71 ). While he is between the two fires ( Ahavaniya and gārhapatya) he mutters standing a verse &lsquo;antarāgni&hellip;maniṣaya&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4). Then he offers a samidh into the gārhapatya fire with Rg. X. 128.2 (=Tai. 8. IV. 7. 14. 1.&rsquo; mama devā vihave&rsquo;). The adhvaryu and saori fioer mutter two verses &rsquo; iba prajā &amp;c.&rsquo; and &lsquo;iba paśavo&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4, Sat. I. 2. p. 71). The adbvaryu then places a samidh on the dakṣiṇa fire with &lsquo;mayi deva&rsquo;(Rg. X. 128. 3, Tai. S. IV, 3. 14. 1). Then the two mutter a verse &lsquo;ayam pitśṇām&rsquo; (Tai, Br. III. 7. 4). Those who maintained sabhya and avagathya fires offered samidhs to them with mantras&quot;28) (from Tai. Br. III, 7. 4).</p>

<p>A mantra is ordinarily to be rocited after saying &lsquo;on&rsquo;. But this is not the rule in srauta rites and so this has not been stated in the text everywhere. The fuel-stick may be offered either by the sacrificer or by the adhvaryu ( Kat. II. 1. 2).</p>

<p>There is a great divergence of view as to the mantras, tho order of the fires and the number of samidhe. Kat. (II. 1. 3-4) prosoribos the offering of two gamidhs in each firo (one with a mantra and the other miloptly). The hymn Rg. X. 128 or Tai. 8. IV. 3. 14 is oallod</p>

The order of fires was, tocording to somo, first garbapatys, thon dakplpagni, then thavaniya (Est. II. 1. 6). Some said that only tho vydartia wore to be attored when offering fuol-stioks (Ap.

Sānnayyu was offered to Indra or Mahendra (Sat. Br. I. 6. 4. 21 and Kat. IV. 2,10). The Tai, S. II. 5. 4. 4 says that only one who is gatasri (explained above in note 2259 ) can offer sānnayya to Mahendra, while Sat. (I. 4 p. 103 ) says that for &amp; year or two after som&amp; yāga the sānnāyya should be offered to Indra and then to Mahendra. In the full moon iṣti the deities to whom purodāsa (oake ) is offered are Agni and Agniṣoma and in it ajya is offered to Prajapati silently between the two purodāsas. In the new moon iṣçi the deities of puroddsa are Agni and Indrāgni and sānnāyya is offered by a somayāji to Indra or Mahendra instead of the purodāsa to Indragni( Āsv. I. 3, 9-12 ).</p>
<p>Now Sakhāharana ( which applies only to him who bas performed soms-yāga and only in darseṣti ) will be described. The adhvaryu fetohes &amp; fresh branch of the palasa or sami tree, which (branoh) is taken from the eastern, northern or north-east side of the tree, which has many leaves and which has not a dried up end. Vide Jai. IV. 2.7 about the text &lsquo;he brings a branch turned to the east&rsquo; &amp;o. He outs it off with the words &ldquo;iṣe tva&rsquo; (Tai. 9. I. 1.1.1), then touches water, makes it straight or wipes it down with &lsquo;ūrje tva&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 1. 1. 1), brings it towards the sacrificial ground with a verse</p>
<p>imam prāolm&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4 set out in Ap. I. %. 1, Sat. I. %, p. 76). With that branch he drives away (or separates ) from their mothers six calves with the mantra &lsquo;vāyavas sthopāyavas atha &lsquo;(Tal. 8. I. 1. 1. 1). The adhvaryu makes the cows ( of the sacrificer) start for the pasture with the mantra &lsquo;dovo vaḥ savitą prārpayatu&hellip;ma yah stena Isata magbasamgah (Tal. 8. I. 1. 1), invokes them, when they have started, with a mantra suddhi apab suprapane pibantih&rsquo; (Rg. VI. 28. 7, Tal. Br. II. 8. 8 set out in Sat. I. 2. p. 79). Then be returns to the house of the sacrificer with dhruvā asmin&hellip;&hellip;bahvih&rsquo; (Tai 8. I 1.1) and keeps the branoh in a well-known place ( 80 that it might not fall or be lost) on the sacred fire ground or on a wooden frame near the fires with &lsquo;protect the cattle of the sacrificer&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 1.1). Jai. (IIL. 6. 28-29) states that bathaharapa is meant for both evening and morning milking.</p>

<p>The sacrificer *383 crosses by the west of the dhavaniga to its south and performs acamana (sipping water). Then he oon templates on the sea and pays homage to the deities viz. Agni, Vāyu, Aditya and Vratapati in the manner set out below. 1484</p>
<p>Barhiraharanı (bringing in the bundles of sacred kuśa grase for use). There are various stages in this operation, each stage having its own mantra. The mantras are short prose formulæ whioh occur in the Tai. 8. I, 1. %. They are not set out in detail here. The various stages are: be ( adhvaryu) takes up a sickle or the rib of a horse or ox kept to the north of the gārhapatya with the famous mantra</p>
<p>devasya tvā savituḥ prasave &hellip;.. Idade&rsquo; (I take thee at the impulse of God gevity &amp;o.). He pays homage to the gārba patya with a mantra. The sickle (but not the rib) is heated on the gārhapatya fire. He then goes to the east or north of the sacrificial ground (vihāra) for some distance, finds out a spot where the desired grass grows, leaves aside one clump of darbhas from those growing there and marks as many clumps of darbha As he feels would be enough for his purpose, leaves one clump or one or two blades with the words, &lsquo;I leave you aside as the portion of beasts&rsquo;, touches those darbhas that he intends to cut with &rsquo;this is for the gods&rsquo;, holds them by his closed fingers of the left hand), rubs them upwards with his right hand, brings the siokle in close contact with them, repeats a mantra over the grass and outs off as much as can be held in his closed fingers the nails of which touch each other. This first handful of blades that are out is oalled prastara. Then he further outs an uneven number of handfuls of darbhas (3, 5, 7, 9, 11 ), 4286 repeating the same processes and mantras for each handful, touches the stumps from whioh blades are out off with the mantra &lsquo;God Barhis! may you grow into a hundred shoots&rsquo; and touches the region of his heart with may</p>

In this way three or five handfuls are sur. rounded by &amp; cord, which has its and stretched on the ground towards the east or north. Then heaps of blades are added on and over the last heap the prastara is placed. The whole is then firmly bound with the cord and a knot is made. He takes hold of the bundle thus tied, raises it up, places it on his head, returns with it by the way he went, keeps it inside the vedi on some grass (and not on the bare ground) near the spot where the middle paridhi would be. He pronounoes over the barbis thus placed &amp; mantra and keeps the barbis near the gārbapatya on a mat or the like. He also outs off silently and brings along with barhis other darbhas called paribhojaniya and dried up kusa grass also (ulaparāji). 8888</p>
<p>Idhmāharana (bringing the wood-sticks ).

<p>darbhan about one epan above the tying oord and a mantra is repeated over it (* Tedosi&rsquo; &amp;o. in Sat. I. 2. p. 90). This veda is employed in sweeping the vedi with a mantra. It is given to the wife when she has to repeat a mantra in any action (compare Asv. I. 11. 1). The out portions of darbhas of which veda is formed are oalled veda-parivāsana. These two, idhma. pravradcana and veda-parivāsana, are placed together. He takes up a branch, outs off its leaves (but not all) inside the vedi, so chisels one end of it as to make of it a shovel. This is called upaveṣa 1988. He recites a mantra over it (upavososi&hellip; bhavasi naḥ, Ap. I. 6. 7, Sat. I. 3. p. 91). In the Full moon Bacrifice the upsvega is made silently. He places on the upavesa a triple (made of three darbhas) band of darbhas in such a way that the roots and end portions of both are in contact but they are not tied together into a knot over it. The sacrificer invokes this triple band called pavitra with a mantra &rsquo;trivst palāse &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7. 4, Ap. L 6. 10, Sat. I. 3. p. 92).</p>

He places the sakhāpavitra with its tip to the east ( to the north in the morning milking ) in the ukha with a mantra, touches.the ukha and restrains his speeob **98 holding the śākhāpavitra.

The adhvaryu issues a direction that no one is to pass between the cow that is being suoked by the calf and the sacrificial ground ( vihara ) and all obey it. The adhvaryu invokes the cow with a mantra and the milker sits down near the cow to milk her with a mantra.2284 The householder repeats a mantra when the cow is being milked and another when he hears the sound of the streams of milk falling into the vessel. The milker brings the milk to the adhvaryu, who asks him &lsquo;whom did you milk, declare to us, ( this is ) an offering to Indra, it is vigour&rsquo;. The milker refers to the cow by her name (such as Ganga ) and adds</p>

The adhvaryu places the pavitra in the kumbhi (or ukha ) and pours therein the milk across the pavitra with a mantra. The adhvaryu gets two more cows milked in the same manner (i. e. with the same mantras &amp;c.) except the directions ( such as no one should come &amp;o.). The only difference is that the names of the cows will be different (such as Yamuna ) and that the 2nd and 3rd cows are referred to by him respectively as &lsquo;visva vyacaḥ &lsquo;and&rsquo; viśvakarma&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;visvāyuḥ&rsquo; (in his prati Veoana ). After three cows are milked he loudly utters thrice milk much for Indra, may the offering (havya) inorease for the gods, for the calves, for men; be ready for milking again.

<p>touch the kumbhi while the other cows are being milked. Jai. (XI. 1. 47-53) concludes that the passage of Tai. Br. about milk. ing the other three cows is a mere anuvada and not a vidhi and Sabara quotes passages of the sruti that on that night no agnihotra is offered with milk and the children in the house do not get any milk ( as all milk is used up for the sānnayya ). When all are milked, if any drops have fallen about (on the ground &amp;o. ) he repeats a mantra (Tai. 8. I. 1. 3. 1) and invokes the pot in which sānnayya is to be prepared with a mantra. He washes the inside of the milking vessel with water and then pours that water into the pot (in which sānnayya is to be prepared). He heats the milk and pours over it (i. 0. does abhigharana ) clarified butter silently. He draws the heated pot from the burning coals in euch a way as to make a line on the ground and places it to the east, north or Dorth-east with a mantra. When the bottom of the heated vessel cools, he adds ourds to it in order to coagulate the fresh milk with &lsquo;I add soma ( i. e. ourds) to thee in order to turn thee into curds for Indra&rsquo; (Tal. S. I.1.3).1998 He adds to the vessel what remains sticking to the pot or sruo after agnihotra was offered with &amp; mantra or silently. He pours water in the vessel that is meant as a lid or oover and places that cover or lid on the pot of heated milk. If the covering be of earthenware he throws thereon grass or a twig. He takes out the śākhāpavitra with a mantra (if a palāsa branch was used) or silently ( if one of sami was used) and keeps it in a secure place. He keeps the sānnayya in the garbapaty&amp; side of the vibāra on a dikya or some such contrivance with &lsquo;O Viṣṇu, guard the offering &lsquo;.</p>

<li>There were several views hore about adding ourds. One, two or throo cows are milked on the day previous to the upavasatha day (i&hellip; on the 14th ) and that milk is used to acidify the fresh beated milk of tho svoning of the upavasatha day. Another method was to milk tho cow or cows on the 12th, then to add the cords of that to the milk of the 13th day and add all the curds of those two days to the milk of the 14th day i. o. milking and adding of curds was to go on continuously from the 12th, 13th and 14th or from 13th or from 14th.

<p>morning milking (of the principal day). There are a few differences as to mantras, as to not adding coagulating sub stance, whioh are passed over.</p>
<p>After the sāyandoha (evening milking) the adhvaryu directs (Agnidhra or some other priest or himself) strew kuśa grass round the fires, first round abavanlys, then gārhapatya, then dakṣiṇāgni&rsquo; or the order may be first gārhapatys, then dakṣiṇāgni and lastly ahavaniya. The darbhas strewn on the south and north have tips turned to the east. The sacrificer mutters &amp; mantra when kuśas are being strewn.</p>
<p>Having done so much he observes the amāvāsy&amp; as an upavasatha. Thus on the amāvāsyā day he performs agnyan vādhāna (offering fuel-stioks into fires), separating the oalves with the branch, sāyamdoha, bringing barhis and idhma, pre paring the veda and vedi and observing some vows. But two of these viz. separating calves from their mothers and sāyam. doha are performed only by him who has already performed a soma sacrifice. In the case of the pūrpamāsa iṣti if spread over two days, on the Full moon day only agnyanvādhana and strewing kuśas round the fires are gone through and on the next day are performed the bringing of barbis and idhma and making of veda and all the other rites. If the iṣti is to be performed in one day only, then kusa grass is strewn round the fires after the making of the veda bunch.</p>
<p>About tānnāyya Sat. states some divergent views. The Kapeyas beld that even one who has not performed soma-yaga may offer sānnāyya and the deity in his Cage will be Indra and after he offers Soma, the deity for sānnayya will be Mahendra. According to Sabara on Jai. X. 8. 44 the Gopa yanas beld that one who has not performed a soma sacrifice may offer sānnāyya. According to Sat, himself, for a year or two after Somay&amp;ga the deity will be Indra and then Mahendra if the sacrificer go desires. Persons of the Aurva and Gautama gotras and those who are gatasri ( vide note 2259 ) may if they like offer sānnayya to Mahendra even before performing Somayaga. Compare Ap. I. 14. 8-11 and vide Jai. X. 8. 35-46 (about the two purodāgas and sānnayya).</p>
<p>On the principal day (i. e, the first day of the dark half in the case of pörpamāsa) the sacrificer offers his daily agnihotra before sunrise and begins after sunrise the performance of the pūrnamāsa iṣti (and in the case of the darkești before sunrise ).</p>
<p>1020</p>
<p>He washes his hands with water with the mantra “May I be able to carry out this rite meant for you two and for gods&rdquo; (Tai, 8. I. 1. 4. 1). From the place of the gārhapatya fire to the havaniya he spreads a line of dry kusa grass continuously with their tips to the east (without leaving any space uncovered) with the mantra &rsquo;thou art the continuity of the sacrifice, I spread thee for the continuity of sacrifice, thee for the conti nuity of the sacrifice&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 2.4) and then spreads another line of kuras to the south and another to the north of this first line silently. To the south of the āhavaniya, seats of kusa grass are made ready for the brahmā priest and the saori ficer, that of the brahma being to the east of the seat of the sacrificer and directly to the south of the ābavaniya and of the sacrificer to the south of the south corner of the east side of the vedi. To the north of gārhapatya kuśas are strown with their tips to the east or north and on them the sacrificial implements (yajñapātras ) are placed in twos after being washed with water and with their mouths turned down, viz., the sphya and kapālas &amp;o. (vide above note 2233 for the ten). This is called pātrāsādana (placing the utensils near ) 4388</p>
<p>Then follows brahmavarana.</p>
<p>The sacrifioer sitting on a seat with his face to the north then chooses his brahmā priest who faces the cast near the utkara with the formula 2399 01 Lord of the earth I Lord of the worlds / Lord of great being (Heaven?)! I choose thee as brahmā&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The brahmā priest when 80 chosen mutters a long formula ( which is given in Ap. III. 18. 4 from the Tai. Br. III. 7.6 and part of which is translated here ) *I am the Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds, lord of the great being. Being impelled by god Savitr I shall perform the duties of a priest.

III. 2. 4. 4.), touches water and sits down on his seat with face to the east with a mantra and then faces the abavaniya with a mantra &lsquo;Here do I, impelled by God Savits, sit on the seat of Vasu (or prosperity) lower in level ( than the dhavaniya mound), I oocupy the seat of Bșhaspati, this I declare to Agni, to Vāyu, to the Sun, to the Earth&rsquo;(vide Ap. III.18.4, Kat, II. 1.24). The brahma is required to be the most learned in Vedic lore&rsquo; ( brahmiṣtha, as Ap. III. 18. 1 says) and he is to observe silence while mantras are being repeated and superintends all actions. His permission is asked by the adhvaryu at the time of doing most of the sots, such as leading forward the pranitā water, sprinkling the bundle of fuel-sticks and kusa grass. There are four priests in darsa pūrṇamāsa ( vide note 2228 ). The sacrifioer also crosses by the west side of the dhavaniya to its south, tbrows away silently &amp; blade of kuśa from his seat and then sits down on the seat prepared for him, with his face to the east. The adhvaryu takes two darbhas of equal thickness, the tops of which are not cut off and makes them a span in length by cutting off their roots (without using his nails ). 2209</p>
<p>The adhvaryu, sitting to the west (or north ) of the gārha patya fire, takes &amp; camasa (a rather flat vessel or pan) in which water is to be carried forward with &rsquo;to thee for Dakṣa&rsquo; (Ap.

I. 16. 3) and at the same time contemplates on the Earth with &lsquo;I take you with this&rsquo; (not uttered). He fills the vessel so as to leave some space at the top and purifies the water by the process called utpavana (desorib. ed above in note 2291 ). He then invokes them with &lsquo;may the divine waters, that are the first purifiers and the leaders carry this sacrifice to the front, may they place the lord of the sacrifice in front, Indra chose you in his fight with Vitra, you chose him in the fight with Vṛtra, you are sprinkled &lsquo;(Tai. 8. I. 1.5. 1). The adhvaryu then asks the permission of the brahmā priest in the words &lsquo;Brahman) shall I carry forward the water&rsquo; and lesues a direction sacrificer, observe silence&rsquo;. The brahma priest mutters &amp; mantra * Lead forward the sacrifice, Bustain these deities, may the sacrificer be on the baok of heaven. Place this sacrifice and the sacrifioer in the world where the seven sages and other men of holy deeds dwell&rsquo;and loudly says&rsquo;yes, do carry the water forward&rsquo;. The adhvaryu then repeats the verse who carries you forward? Let him oarry you forward. I carry for ward the divine waters; may they sit round our sacrifice, conveying to the sacrificer thousandfold prosperity, the waters that delight in drink, having a shining (or oily ) appearance&rsquo;. He holds the water in &amp; vessel which is covered by the sphya that has its tip to the east and that is held level with his nose and carries it forward without allowing even a drop to fall down. When the water is being carried the sacrificer invokos it with a mantra, 9800 The adhvaryu places the water vessel (pranitāpātra ) on darbha grass to the north of the ahavaniya with the mantra &lsquo;you are sanotified by brahma ( prayers ); who employs you ? Let him employ for securing) all desires, for the worship of gods (Ap. IV. 4. 4)&rsquo; and then covers the vessel with kusas. All these acts constitute pranitāpranayana. While the water is being placed near the Ahavaniya the sacrificer invokes it with the immediately preceding mantra and passes his eye over the whole of the sacrificial ground. No one is to pass between the dhavaniya and the prapita water (Kat. II. 3. 4).</p>

<p>The principal purpose of the pranita waters is that they are used for making the ground grains into &amp; dough for purodass and their final disposal is to be poured into the vedi (Jal. IV, %. 14-15). The adhvaryu comes back by the same way that he went, places down the sphya among the yajśapātras and touobes the sacrificial utensils with his hand wearing a pavitra with the mantra &lsquo;may the divine groups enter into the sacrificial utensils&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Then follows nirvāpa 1301 (taking out handfuls of grains or a portion of other sacrificial material). The adhvaryu takes in his hand the ladle called agnibotra-havani with thou art made of a tree for dakṣa&rsquo; (strength). Then he holds it in his left hand and takes the winnowing basket ( sūrpa ) in his right hand with &rsquo;to thes for the all-pervading (yajña).

While touching the right side of the yoke he mutters * thou art dhūr ( destruc tive fire), injure the destructive (enemy), destroy him wbo seeks to destroy us and whom we seek to destroy&rsquo;.

After this the gacrificer&rsquo;s wife or some one else (such as the ag nidhra ) threshes the grains in the mortar ( Kāt. II, 4. 14). Jai. (XI. 1. 27 ) states that the beating has &amp; seen purpose (viz, removal of husk) and so it is to be continued as long as required for effect. ing that purpose. Jai.

The adhvaryu then holds the winnowing basket near the mouth of the mortar to its east or north with the words &rsquo;thou art grown by rain 1313 ( as it is made of bamboo ) and touches the beaten grains ( to be used for purodaśa ) with you are grown by rain&rsquo;.

I. 1. 10. 1). In modern practice the wife girds up her waist with the yoktra herself. He does not gird her up over the garment worn round the waist but inside it ( Ap. II. 5.5 says there is an option). The yoktra has a loop at one end in which the other end is inserted and the cord is passed round the waist of the wife twice, a knot like that of the top-knot (sikbā of &amp; man) is made to the north of the navel with may Pūṣan tie a knot for you&rsquo; and it is drawn to the south of the navel from left to right.

The agnidhra places the djyasthāll on the northern portion of the gārbapatya fire and melts it with thou art light&rsquo;; he takes it from the fire with &rsquo;to thee for light&rsquo; and carries it to the south of the dhavaniya with &lsquo;follow after light&rsquo;.

The yajamāna also invokes with the same mantras when the ladling is going on. The adhvaryu removes the ājyasthall together with the veda and sruva from the vedi, keeps the ajya in some place other than the utkara, invokes the prokṣaŅl waters with the divine waters (āpo deyir &amp;a, Tai, $.

S. I. 1. 11. 1). He places the whole bundle of barhis with the knot to the east inside the vedi with a (sautra) mantra &lsquo;we had recourse to barbis &amp;c.&rsquo; and sprinkles the tips, the middle portions and the roots of the barhis respectively with * to thee for heaven&rsquo;, &rsquo;to thee for the aerial region&rsquo;, &rsquo;to thee for the earth.&rsquo; While the sprinkling proceeds the yajamāna repeats &amp; Verse may the waters and herbs be well disposed to the yajamāna &amp;o.&rsquo; (Ap. IV. 6.1). He dips the tips of the barhis in the water contained in the agnihotra-havani and then the roots also. He sprinkles over the knot of the barbis from east to west water from the sruo over which he places his hand ( 80 that water oozes over it from his finger tips ) with &rsquo;to you for nourishment&rsquo; ( Tai. S. VII. 1. 11). He pours down the remain ing prokṣapi water from the southern corner ( sroṇi) of the west side of the vedi to its north corner with &lsquo;svadbā to the pitre, mayst thou be strength for the barhiṣad pitss, may you (the partioles of water ) go to the earth with strength and the yajamāna says this is for the Barhiṣad pitrs.&rsquo;</dt>

I strew thee that art soft like wool, as &amp; good seat for the gods&rsquo;. The darbhas are spread in three or five series (or divisions) beginning from the west side of the vedi towards the east (or the reverse according to some) in such a way that the tips of one set that is already spread cover the roots of the next and the grass is so thickly strewn that the ground below cannot be easily seen. When the kusa grass is being strewn the yajamāna recites a mantra &lsquo;O barhis, that are soft like wool, being spread &hellip; &hellip; place me in heaven &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7.6), when the vedi is covered with the middle division of the barhis he recites the mantra &rsquo;this young lady with four tufts of hair &amp;c.&rsquo; (Tai, Br, III. 7.6) and when the vedi is completely covered he recites &amp; long passage &lsquo;May you be suspicious to me &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; increase food, strength, spiritual lustro, martial brilliance, prosperity, progeny, cattle for me &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7.6).&rsquo;</p>
<p>He takes out two blades ( to be used later) for the andyajas and keeps them separately to the east, feeds the ahavaniya with fire-wood, takes back the prastara from the hand of the yaja māna, and while holding the prastara himself places the three enoircling fuel-sticks (paridhi) round the āhavaniya fire. The middle paridhi is placed on darbhas to the west of the abavaniya with the tip towards the north with 8348 thou art gandharva &amp;o.&rsquo;. While the middle paridhi is being placed the yajamāna recites a mantra ( Tai. Br. III. 7. 6). The other two paridhis are laid to the south and north of the abayanlya place with their tips to the east, the southern one extending a little beyond the abavaniya place and touching the middle paridhi and the northern one also touches the middle paridhi.

Rg. V. 26. 3 or Tai. 8. I. 1. 11) and the other to the north of it silently. From the midst of the barhis he takes two darbhas of equal length, that have no blade hhooting from inside of them; these are called vidbști and are laid down on the barbis strewn on the vedi in the middle portion of the latter with their tips turned northwards with &lsquo;you two are the regulators of people&rsquo;. When the vidbftis are being laid down the yajamāna repeats a long passage &lsquo;I cut off my enemies with the vidhṛtis&hellip;&hellip;may you support life, progeny and cattle in me&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6) The adhvaryu keeps the prastara bunch on these two vidhftis with &lsquo;sit in this abode of Vasus, Rudras and Adityas&rsquo; (Tsi. 8. I. 1. 11) and the yajamāna repeats a mantra &rsquo;this prastara is the support of both Prayājas and Anāyājas &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7.6). The adhvaryu places the jubū on the prastara in such a way that its rod will be alongside of the roots of the prastara bunch with a mantra, 3349 The upabhrt is placed to the north of the juhū in such a way that its root is very much to the West of the root of the juhū and it is underneath the vidhtis, and the dbrupā is placed to the north of the upabbṭt over the vidhftis and its root is very much to the west of that of the upabhrt. The three should not be so placed as to touch each other. The yajamāna repeats three passages (all from Tai. Br. III 7. 6) addressed to the three ladles when they are being placed. The adhvaryu lays down the sruya to the south of the jubū (or to the north of the dhruvā but a little behind its bowl) with &rsquo;thou art a bull possessed of strength, I seat thee in the extent of vaṣatkāra&rsquo;. He places the ajyasthall also in suoh a spot as space would permit. The yajamina repeats &amp; mantra for sruva and another for ajyasthall (Tai. Br, III, 7. 6).

Br. III. 7.5) and drops butter silently on the northern purodaśa. If the second offering be sānnayya (instead of a purodasa ) he drops clarified butter over the boiled milk with a mantra May that self of yours that has entered cattle&hellip;go to the gods and secure heaven for me who am a Bacrificer&rsquo;( Tai.

He lays down the two purodāsas to the west of the srucs, that for Agni being to the south and the other being to the north with &lsquo;may you occupy this loved seat by your lovable lustre.&rsquo; If sānnayya is to be offered, he bridgs together (makes them touch each other) in the middle of the vedi the two jars of it and then keeps them separate, the one containing the boiled milk on the southern corner of the west side of the vedi and that containing ourds on the northern corner thereof. When the sānnayya is being thus placed the yajamāna repeats a verse &lsquo;yasta &amp;tma&rsquo; &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. Br, III. 7. 5) and repeats &amp; mantra (from Tai. Br.

The adhvaryu addresses the brabmā priest &lsquo;O brahman I shall I call on (the agnidhra ) to listen to the pra vara ?&rsquo; The brahmā priest first repeats inaudibly &lsquo;O lord of speeohl make (him) listen to this speech, make the sacrifice be heard among gods, and me among men (Ap.

When the sound vaṣat is heard the adhvaryu offers ajya from the juhū towards the eastern and the most blazing part of the ahavaniya fire.

The prayāja offerings are addressed to five viz., FAUTI, TETTEL (or EiR ), (or : ), , FTETT: (or FTTT:). Jai. (V. 1. 4-7) enjoins that prayxjas must be offered in the order of the text viz. first to Sanidbab and so on, and Il. 2. 2 declaros that with each repetition of tho word &lsquo;yajati (used ive times) there is a separate unseon result (adīgta or a pūrva ). The three deities of the anuyajas are पहिः, नराशंस, अग्नि स्विष्टकत. The word is written either as WATTS ( Rg. X. 61. 8.9) or ST (Ap. II. 9.8 and elsewhore ). According to Ait.

Io the Nirukta VIII. 22 there is a discussion as to the devatās of prayxjas and Aduydjas and aftor mentioning several views Y#ska statos his own opinion that they are &ldquo;&amp;gneya&rsquo; i, m. they are the difforent forms (Tant) of Agai.

The yajamana says when the first prayāja is offered * this is for the Samidhs. I gratify Vaganta among the seasons, May he ( Vasanta ) being gratified gratify me&rsquo;. The same procedure is followed as to the remaining four prayājas viz. there is first asravana, then pratyagrāvana by the āgnidhra, praiṣa to hotf, recital of the yāyā by the hotr with vaṣa . kāra at end, offering of djya into fire by the adhvaryu, the tyaga by the yajamāna and connecting the five prayajas with the five ytus (seasons) in order from Vasanta ( hemanta and sisira being taken as one). The second prayāja offering is meant for Tanūnapat, but those who belong to the Vasiṣtha, Sunaka, Atri. Vadhryasya and Rajanya (Viśvamitra?) gotras substitute Narā samsa for Tanūnapāt (Śān. I. 7. 3 is slightly different). The whole procedure is briefly indicated in Sanskrit in the note below.9369 The first three pray&amp;ja offerings are made with the ajya in the juhū, but as to the 4th (to Barbis ) he pours half of the Ajya contained in the upabhrt into the juhū and then makes the offering. Wherever there are more prayājas than 5 (e. g. in Varuṇa-praghasa there are nine, in Pasubandha ten) the 4th, 7th and 10th are offered in this way (vide Sat. II. 2. p. 199 and Kat. III. 2. 22-23). Vide Jai. IV. 1. 40 and 41-45. These mantras ( in the note ) occur in Tai. Br. III, 5, 5 where * viyantu&rsquo; is substituted for &lsquo;vyantu&rsquo; (as is usual with the Taittiriyas). The words &rsquo; ye3 yajāmahe used at the beginning of each yājyā are called &lsquo;agūḥ&rsquo;; but there are no such words in the anuyājas ( Aśv. I. 5. 4). Vaṣatkāra is uttered at the end of all ydjyds and in anuyājas also. The yajyā is pronounced very loudly and with great distinctness as to the &lsquo;ye&rsquo; of *ye yajāmahe&rsquo; and the last syllable of the yajya is made pluta. In Asv.

I. 5. 18 states that vaṣatkāra was to be uttered only by day and not by night. There are three topes (mandra madhyama and uttama). Up to the prayājas and after gamyu. Vaka the mandra tone is employed. After prayājas up to sviṣtakst the tone is to be madhyama. Thereafter up to samyuvāks it is to be bigh. Vide Aśv. I. 5. 25-28 and Aśv. I. 5. 4-8 for these and several other rules. Aśv. II. 15. 12 states that the agūḥ (the words ye3 yajāmahe ), the om ( at the end of an anuvākyā ) and the vaṣatkāra are pronounced in a high tone everywhere.</p>
<p>The adhvaryu after the five prayāja offerings comes back and pours some ājya7370 ( left in the jubū after the prayāja offer inga ) over the several offerings ( haviñṣi), first over the dhruvā, then over the purodāsas, the boiled milk, the ourds in the order in which they are sacrificed later on. Lastly be pours a little ajya over the upabhṛt. He lays down the ladles (sruo). He holds thein in his hands from the time when he offers the djyabhāgas up till the offering to Agni Sviṣtakst. He puts into the juhū four ladlings of ajya with the sruva with &lsquo;may the dhruva be strengthened with ghee in each sacrifice for those who serve the gods &amp;o. (Tai. 8.

<p>Puronuvakya and Yājya are required in djyabhāgas, in avapa, in Sviṣtakst and in Patnisamyājas, but in prayājas and anuyājas there are only yajyas (vide Sat. II. 2. p. 189). The puronuvakya is recited by the priest while sitting, while the yājvā is recited standing and the recitation of these is only a samskāra and not a principal act (vide Jai.x.4.39-41), Four ladlings with sruva are made in the juhū for all sacrificers in ajyabhāgas and other homes, but in the case of sacrificers whose gotra is Jāmadagnya five (pañcāvatta) ladlings are made in the juhū (Ap. II. 18.2, Sat. II.2 pp. 190-191) and one whose gotra is not Jāmadagnya may have five ladlings after taking the permission of a Jāmadagnya. The puronuvākyās for the ajyabhāgas in darsesti are Rg.

<p>The adh varyu having gone across (towards the purodābas that are made ready) sprinkles clarified butter on the sruo (juhū) with &lsquo;āpyāyatām dhruvā &amp;o.&rsquo; ( vide p. 1059 above), touobes the several sacrificial offerings with &lsquo;do not be afraid, do not tremble, may I not injure thee; may not thy lustre leave thee; carry across this sacrificer who brings offerings, rain on the earth, in order I shall offer the cut portions; I make an adoration to you, do not injure me&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7.5), 8373 With his thumb and two fingers (viz. the middle and anamika, but using only the fleshy parts and not the nails) he cuts off &amp; portion from the middle of the purodāsa ( oake) meant for Agni and from its front half. Sat. II. 2. p. 191 and Āp. II. 18. 9 say that the avadāna (portion out or severed) is as much as the front joint of the thumb (as a general rule) but that the sviṣtakst offering is larger than the ordinary offering for other deities 837* &amp;c. For the Jāma dagayag a third portion is cut off from the hind part of the purodāsa. Portions from ajya and sānnayya are taken out with the sruva and of cooked food (caru) with the mekṣaṇa. The por tion cut from the middle is placed in the eastern part of the bowl of the srud and the second portion in the western part of the bowl. He sprinkles clarified butter with the sruva (in which ajya is taken from the ājyasthall) on the out portions and on the purodāsa from which they were cut €375 with when cutt ing portions from thee I acted against thee, I anoint that again with ajya, may that grow again in thee&rsquo; (Tai.

The method of this is 1978 that he drops a part of the Ajya from the sruo first (that was sprinkled in it at upastarana and abhigh.rana ), then the two purodaśa portions are thrown and lastly he allows the remaining ajya from the bill-like mouth of the sruo to flow over the purodāsa offerings as if covering them but without disturbing them. The principal āhutis are introduced at the point of the confluence of the two āghāras and each one is offered in the Ahavaniya to the east (or north-east) of the preceding one but in contact with the latter. The yajamāna makes the tyāga &rsquo;this is for Agai&rsquo; with &lsquo;may I have food to eat on account of this worship of Agni.&rsquo; After this offering of purodaśa to Agni, there is an upāmsuyāja (a silent sacrifice ) with clarified butter offered to Prajāpati or to Agniṣomau or Viṣṇu.

In this, the reference to the deity is always inaudible, but even here the asruta, the pratyāśruta, and two directions for reciting anuvakya and yājpā and the vaṣatkāra are uttered loudly. The sacri ficer says in this upāmṇuy&amp;ja &rsquo;thou art a destroyer; may I be uninjured and may I subdue evil. The offering is made of the ajya in the dhruva (Jai.

The second purodāsa is offered to Agni and Soma on pūrṇamāsa in the same way, the anuvākyā and yajya being respectively Rs.

Br. III. 7. 5). From the eastern half of the same purodāsa he outs off a thin but long slice which is the portion of the yajamāna (according to Baud. I. 18 it is three or four angulas long ) and which is anointed (or smeared) with ajya and placed near the dhruvā (or to the east of the dhruva ) in some vessel on the barhis. Then he outs off a part from the portion of the cake that is between its southern and eastern parts. In the same way (i. e. repeating the Verse &lsquo;seen by Manu&rsquo; &amp;c.) he cuts off &amp; portion as idā from the northern purodāśa and other things offered (such as. the boiled milk and ourds ). He then sprinkles ajya over the out portions and removes them towards the east on the vedi. He crosses to the south in front of the botṛ, site bebind the hots with his face to the east and anoints the front two joints of the fore-finger of the hotr with djya from the sruva, first the front joint and then the one next to it. The hotr wipes with the palm of the hand turned towards his chest the uppermost joint of the finger on the upper lip and the next joint on his lower lip with &lsquo;I partake of thee that art sacrificed by the lord of speech for food, for prāna&rsquo; and &lsquo;I partake of thee that are offered by the lord of the mind for strength, for apana&rsquo; respectively ( Aśv.

The hotr acoepts the idā (i. e. the vessel of ida ) in his joined hands, places the idā in his left hand, keepa his right hand near the idā to its west with the fingers turned northwards and makes the adhvaryu out off from the idā itself &amp; portion oalled avāntareda into the right hand in the following mander.

He looks at the bots and thinks of Vāyu in his mind&rsquo;o Vāyu / Ida is thy mother (Ap.

When the invocation of idā is finished, he repeats * may Indra put in us vigour &amp;c.&rsquo;. When the words the divine adhvaryus &lsquo;are uttered, the adhvaryu mutters &lsquo;May I be endowed with cattle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the invooation of Idā is finished the adhvaryu passes round the āhavaniya towards its east and takes the prābitra to the brahmā priest and hands it over to him, Asv. I. 13. 2 des. oribes in detail what thereon the brabmā does.

<p>Plenty of rice is cooked on the dakṣiṇa fire. This is called anvāhārya. The adhvaryu sprinkles ajya over 1390 it (i. e. performs abbighārapa ) and takes it from the dakṣiṇa fire to the north of it. He issues &amp; direction to the yajamāna &lsquo;offer (the boiled rice ) to the priests that sit to the south&rsquo; and when the sacrificer says &lsquo;come to the south&rsquo; the priests do as requested ( i. e. come to the south). The yajamāns issues a direction to the four priests &rsquo;this boiled rice is yours, take it according to your shares&rsquo;. The rice is divided into four parts and the priests accept their respective portions with &lsquo;I accept thee at the impulse of God Savitr &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; with the hands of Pūṣan; may king Varuna take you. Who gave to whom? Desire ( Kama) bas given to Kāmna &hellip;&hellip; O Kāma, this is thy fee. May Angsrasa with upturned palm accept it&rsquo; (the whole formula occurs in Ap. XIV. 11.2).2391 The priests come back to the north (and then brahmā comes to his usual seat). The adhvaryu keeps aside the remnants of the several offerings (such as the agniṣomlya oako or sānnayya ) and of the boiled rice outside the vedi to its north.</p>
<p>He throws into the Abavaniya the two blades that are now kindled at the fire and had been kept aside (vide p. 1040 above). The adhvaryu says to the brahmā priest &lsquo;O brahmanl we shall start or commence (Tai. 8. II. 6. 9. 1).

The yajamāna says as usual &lsquo;agnaya idam&rsquo; and repeats &lsquo;O fire, this is thy samidh &amp;c.&rsquo; (Ap. III. 4. 6) and implores Agni to vanquish and destroy bis enemies (the lengthy formula is in Ap. IV.11.5). He (the agnidhra ) without moving about wipes the paridbis as before with the tying cords of idhma ( but without holding the sphya), the middle one from south to north and the other two from west to east, and wipes the fire also from west to east with &lsquo;O fire, that securest food &amp;o.&rsquo; (Ap. III. 4.7 gives the whole). He sprinkles water over the tying cords ( with which wiping was done ) and throws them into the ābavaniya with * do not injure our cattle, (you ) who are Rudra, the lord of beings &amp;o.&rsquo; ( Sat. II. 3. p. 213). The yajamāna makes the tyaga &rsquo;this is for Rudra, the lord of beings, who moves among rows (of Maruta ).</p>
<p>The yajamāna touches water and mutters a mantra (which is in Ap. IV. 11. 6. vedirbarhiḥ &amp;c.). The yajamāna also performs japa of the Saptahoir 1893 formulas before the anuyajas are offered. The adhvaryu takes into the juhū the djya from the upabbṛt (leaving some in the latter), crosses over to the south with the juhū and sets about offering the three anupājas. First there is the agravana (03srāāvaya ), then pratyagravana (astu srau 3ṣat) by āgnidbra who always holds the sphyx when saying this.

<p>drops of Maruts ; go to heaven and send thence rain to us&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13. 1).&rdquo; Jaimini makes it clear (VI. 4. 43-47 ) tbat sakbā is not a subordinate complement of the prastara but the real meaning of the text&rsquo;he throws the prastara with the bakba&rsquo; is to indicate the time when the sakha is to be thrown into fire. Jaimini (IV. 2. 10-13 ) states that the throwing of the gakba into fire is pratipattikarma ( i.e. that is the final disposal of the sākha ). When throwing the prastara he does not bend his hand but holds it rather straight and hanging downwards and the tips of the prastars are not put beyond the fire nor are they turned upwards, nor are the tips allowed to be first acorohed. He raises it up, brings it slowly down and rolls it on the hearth of the ahavaniya (making the upper portion come down and vice versa). The adhvaryu, when the hotf says &rsquo;this sacrificer seeks ( hopes for ) blessings&rsquo; directs the agnidhra to consign the prastara to fire. The āgnidbra tbrice raises with bis joined hands the prastara into the &amp;bavaniya fire. The sacrificer makes the tyāga to the several deities mentioned in the sūktavāka (agnaya idam, somāyedam &amp;o.) and adds (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 1)&lsquo;may I win victory following the victory of Agni&rsquo; (then of Soma and so on for the other deities ). 1400 When the bots mentions the name of the sacrificer the latter recites &ldquo;these blessings have come here&rsquo; (Tai, 8. 1. 6. 4.% and Ap. IV. 12. 5). The adhvaryu directe the agnidhra to throw into fire on the prastara the blade of kuga taken from the prastara and kept aside ( as described above p. 107) and tbe āgnidbra 3401 does so with &lsquo;Good speed to the tanūs, svaha&rsquo;. The yajamāna mutters &rsquo;this for the Tanūs&rsquo; and proceeds &lsquo;This pillar spread down from beaven and was raised over the earth. With it that has a thousand shoots we worry our enemy etc. (Tai. Br. III. 7. 6 and Ap. IV. 12. 8). The adhvaryu points out thrice with his forefinger the blade thrown into, fire with this, this&rsquo; and touches his nose and eyes with * Agnil thou art the protector of life, protect my life, thou art the protector of eyes&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13.2). Then the adhvaryu touobes the earth inside the vedi with thou art stable&rsquo;( idid).</p>

<p>The āgnidhra then addresses the adhvaryu &rsquo;talk with me&rsquo;. The adhvaryu asks &lsquo;has (the prastara ) been consigned to flames&rsquo;? The Agnidhra replies it has gone to the fire&rsquo;. Tben after aśrāvana and pratyasrāvaṇa the adhvaryu touching the middle enclosing stiok ( paridbi) issues a direction to the hotr</p>
<p>Good speed to the divine hotrs ( here the paridhis ) and bliss to human hotf8. Recite for sam-yoh, 2408 Then the hot; recites the verge &lsquo;we long for that san-yoh, for (the) path to sacrifice and to the lord of sacrifice. May divine bliss be ours! May there be bliss for human beings. May the means (of bliss ) ascend upwards ! All bealth to the two-footed and the four footed that are ours&rsquo; (i, e. to men and cattle ).03 When the Samyuvāka is repeated the yajamāna mutters may I attain stability by yajña, samyoḥ (health and wealth) by the worsbip of Viṣṇu&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 6. 4. 3). The adhvaryu then throws into the fire the middle paridbi with &lsquo;O God Agni, that paridhi whloh you laid down &hellip;&hellip; svāhā&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 1. 13. 2).</p>
<p>The adhvaryu then pushes on to the burning coals of the ahavenlys the other two paridhis together (the southern and northern ones) with the food of saoriāce has come together.&rsquo; He thrusts the tip of the northern paridbiunderneath the middle one in the burning coals and keeps the tip of the southern over the middle one. When the paridhis are being thrown on the fire the yajamāna mutters &lsquo;I loosen thy girdle &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 6. 4, 3). After the paridhis are thrown the adhvaryu invokes them &lsquo;may you spread (1. o. prolong the life of) the sacrificer&rsquo;.</p>
<p>The adhvaryu then lays on the bowl of the juhū the upabbft and lets flow from the two ladles the remnants of butter into fire with &lsquo;O Viśve Devas! You have for your sbare the remnants ( samsrāva ) of ajya&hellip;svāba&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13. 2). &ldquo;404</p>

<p>The adhvaryu takes up the juhū and upabhrt, the hots takes the veda bunch and the agnidhra takes the pot of Ajya (ajya sthall) together with the gruva. Being about to perform the patnisamy.jus 4408 the adhvaryu passes to the south of the gārhapatya fire (from its east side) and the other two priests ( hotṛ and āgnidhra ) pass to its north. The adhvaryu places the two ladles on the sphyx with &lsquo;I place you in the abode of Agni whose house is indestructible; may you who are happy place me in happiness for the sake of happiness; may you who are the foremost (or leaders ) protect me. when I am in front&rsquo; (Tai.

<p>the adhvaryu issues a direction to the hot to recite an anu vakyā (invitatory prayer) for Soma (then for Tvaṣtr and so on), then the bots recites the anuvākya, then there is afruta and pratyāśruta, followed by adhvaryu directing the hots to recite the yājyā for Soma (or Toastr or otbers as the case may be), and when the bots utters &lsquo;val 3ṣat&rsquo; the adhvaryu pours the ājgā oblation from the juhū into the gārbapatya ( in this rite). The offering to Soma is made in the northern part of the gārbapatya, that to Tvaṣts in the southern part and for the rest between these two. The offering to the wives of the gods may be made in an enclosed space (i. e. by placing a screen to the east of the gārbapatya ) so as to shut the gārhapalya from view on the eastern side. 5407 Additional offerings were allowed to be made to Rākā, Sinivāli and Kubū by those who desired song, cattle or prosperity respectively either before or after the offering to the wives of the gods. The procedure is briefly indicated in the note below, 8408</p>
<p>The yajamāna makes a tyāga ( of the offering ) with this for Soma&rsquo; (or for Tyaṣt; and so on) and adds a separate for mula in each case invoking separate blessings of vigour, cattle, progeny and stability (vide Āp.

<p>The adhvaryu then smears the two front points of the hotr&rsquo;s finger as before, first the hind joint and then the front joint. He breathes over it and touches water. The adh varyu drops into the palm of the right hand of the hotf four drops of Ajya as ida &ldquo;10 and six in that of the āgnidhra. The hotṛ inaudibly invokes both ( viz, his own ida and āgnidhra&rsquo;s, the hand of the latter being held underneath the former&rsquo;s ) in the same words as before (vide Appendix under note 2384). When the words &rsquo;this yajamāna has been summoned&rsquo; are uttered, the wife mutters &lsquo;being summoned may I surpass in the possession &ldquo;11 of cattle,&rsquo; and the adhvaryu also performs japa as above. When the ida is being invoked the adhvaryu, the āgnidhra and the wife (with &amp; darbha blade ) touch the hots. The yajamāna invokes ajya ida with &lsquo;may idā cover us with gbrta &amp;o.&rsquo; ( Ap. IV. 13. 4). At the end of the invocation of idā the hot; eata the ida ( drops of ajya ) and the āgnidbra eats his with &lsquo;father Heaven has been invoked, may the fire summon me from agni dhra for my life, lustre &amp;c.&rsquo; (Tai. Br. III. 7.6). He silently performs mārjana after partaking of idā. The patnisamyājas end with the invocation of idā or they may be inished after reciting Samyuvāka (Sat. II. 5, p. 225; Aśv.

III. 10. 2 ) 2420 and the yajamāna gays</p>
<p>this is for Indra &amp;o.&rsquo; The adhvaryu offers an oblation of djya with sruva on the pūrnamāsa isti with &lsquo;we offer worship to pūr pamāsa the foremost &amp;c. svābā&rsquo; (Tal. Br. III. 7. 5 quoted by Sat. II. 5 p. 230 ) and a similar oblation on darseṣti witha &ldquo;Amèrāsyā is fortunate and full of happiness &amp;o. svaha.&rsquo; The yajamāna makes tyāga. These are called pārvanahoma and according to some they are optionally performed before the offering to Sviṣtakrt. Jaimini ( IX. 2.51-56 ) establishes that these two homas are not performed in other iṣtis that are the modifications ( vikrti) of darśapūrṇamāsa and in IX. 2. 57-58 establishes that both are not performed on pūrpamāsesti and darbeṣti, but the first homa (in which there is an oblation to pūrpamāsa ) is alone performed on pūrnamāseṣti and the other on darsesti. The adhvaryu takes ajya six times with the mantra</p>

<p>The adhvaryu recites apyāyatām dhruva&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 6.5.1), takes ajya thirty-eight times and offers with the juhū oblations called sarvaprāgascittas to thirty-eight deities in the abavaniya with a mantra for each, 24&amp;2 and there is an appropriate tyāga in each case.</p>
<p>The adhvaryu repeats the mantra &lsquo;āpydyatam &amp;c.&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 6.5. 1), increases the dhruva (with ajya ), stands erect Inside the vedi and offers with the druvā three homes called Samiętayajus 2433 in the āhavaniya with &lsquo;yo path-finding gods! after finding the path, return by it. O Lord of the mind 1 place this our sacrifice among the gods, in speech, in the wind (Tai. 8. I. 1. 13. 3). When the word svābā is repeated the second time he throws the barbis into the fire. The yajamāna says &rsquo;this is for the path-finding gods, for Yajña&ndash;for Para. mātman&rsquo; and utters tbe invocation • agne adabdhāyo&rsquo; (Tai. S.

He carries the prapita waters from the eastern side with &rsquo;to you for prosperity&rsquo; and pours them down inside the vedi with &lsquo;may he who joined you toge ther separate you&rsquo;. The adh varyu pours on those pranita waters &amp; continuous stream of water for the yajamāna who holds it in his joined hands and mutters &rsquo;thou art true, be true to me &hellip;&hellip; do not perish for me&rsquo; (sadasi &hellip;&hellip; kṣeṣthaḥ&rsquo; Tai, S. I. 6.5.1), throws up water in different directions with &lsquo;may gods and priests cleanse with water in the east &amp;o.&rsquo; ( Āsv.

<p>The adhvaryu then takes up the upaveṣa and conceals it inside the dust of the utkara (vide Ap. III. 13. 6) and if it is desired to practise magic against one&rsquo;s enemy, then he throws the upaveṣa on the utkara after taking the enemy&rsquo;s name (Ap. III. 14. 1, Sat. II. 6. p. 237 ). Vide Tai. Br. III. 3. 11 for the upaveṣa and the mantras. The adhvaryu takes leave of the Yajñs with &lsquo;Let him who yokes you discharge you&rsquo; (Tai. 8. 1. 5. 10.3 quoted in Sat. II. 6. p. 237) and passes his eye over the whole sacrificial ground.2424 Then he discharges the kapālas with the kapalas that were in the cauldron&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 5. 10. 3-4 quoted in Sat. II. 6. p. 237), counts them and keeps them aside. Then the adhyaryu goes out. The brahmā also places a fuel-stick on fire with the fire has been worshipped &amp;o. ( Ap. III. 13. 1 and Sat.

<p>more ground than each preceding one. He first reoites four mantras &rsquo;thou art the stride of Viṣṇu &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 6. 5. 2 ) when taking the strides. Then he mutters &amp; long prayer to the Sun &lsquo;O Light of Mitra rising to-day &amp;c.&rsquo; (Tai, Br. III. 7.6 and Tal. S. 1. 6. 6.1, quoted in Ap. IV. 15.1 and I. 16. 1). He contemplates the destruction of his enemy with the words. Here do I exclude from a share my enemy the evil.doer &amp;o.&rsquo; He revolves round himself from left to right with &lsquo;I turn the turning of Indra&rsquo;( Tai, 8. I. 6. 6. 2) and goes round the abavaniya with &lsquo;Let me bave suspioious riches and may evil riches remain away from me&rsquo; (Ap. IV. 15.4). He bends over the dhavaniya with &rsquo;thou art light&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 1.10.3), pays homage to it with May I be united with my children and may my children be united with me &amp;c.&rsquo; (Tai, S. I. 6. 6. 2, Ap. IV, 15. 4). He puts the fire into flames &lsquo;O fire, being kindled, shine for me &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 2, Ap. IV. 16. 5). He prays to the abavaniya with &lsquo;The sacrifice is endowed with riches, may I be endowed with riches &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. 8. 1. 6.6.2, Ap. IV. 15. 5.). He prays to the dakṣiṇa fire &lsquo;O fire, cook food pleasantly eaten for our progeny&rsquo; (Ap. IV. 16. 5). He prays to the gārbapatya fire with the two verses to Agni Pavamāna (Rg. IX. 66. 19-20, Tai. S. I. 6.6.2), and with &lsquo;O Agni Gphapatil I am a good house-holder &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. 8. I. 6.6.3). If he has no son he prays 1436 &ldquo;I pray for that blessing full of spiritual lustre for my son ( to be )&rsquo; and if he has &amp; son ho prays &lsquo;I pray for my son 8o and so that blessing &amp;c.&rsquo;( Tai. S. I. 6. 6. 3). He sits between the two fires inside the vedi with &rsquo;to thee (unborn or born son as the case may be) who art light &amp;c.&rsquo; (Ap. IV. 16.6). He places on his lap the blades of the veda (that had been unloosened) and sitting inside the vedi mutters the Ati moksa mantras &lsquo;May Agni guard me against those gods that strike the sacrifice &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. S. III. 5. 4. 1-% indicated in Ap. IV. 14. 10).</p>
<p>He then comes to his deat, looks at the whole sacrifice with &lsquo;who yokes thee? Let him free thee&rsquo; ( Tai. S. I, 6. 6. 3). He then discharges himself from vrata with O fire, lord of vratas, I observed vrata &amp;o.&rsquo; (Tai. 8. 1. 6. 6. 3, Tai. A. IV. 41,</p>

<p>is an independent rite and not a mere subordinate part of the darga sacrifioe. On the other hand several writers held that it was &amp; subordinate part (anga ) of darśa e. g. Kāt. IV. 1, 30 appears to be of that opinion and the paddhati on it notes that all bhāṣyakāras like Karka stick to that opinion. 8428 The pindapitryajña is briefly described below. For details, vide Sat. Br. II. 4. 2, Tai, Br, I. 3, 10, II. 6. 16, Aśv. II. 6-7, Āp. I. 7-10, Kat. IV. 1. 1-30, Sat. II. 7, Baud, III. 10-11. It is performed on amāvāsyā day when the moon cannot be seen and its distance from the sun is the least, in the last third part of the day or when only the rays of the sun are visible on the tops of trees. 8430 The caru (boiled rice ) is cooked on the dakṣiṇāgni and the oblation is offered in the same. In this and other ways a contrast is brought out between rites for gods and for Manes. He kindles a blade on the dakṣiṇa fire and carries it to</p>
<p>the south-east of that fire with the mantra&rsquo; ye rūpāṇi &amp;c.&rsquo; (Vaj. 8. II. 30 ).4431 All actions are to be done facing the south-east unless otherwise specified. The darbha grass (to be employed in this rite) is severed at one stroke and is brought with or without its roots ( Ap. I. 7.3-4). Strewing round the dakṣiṇāgni darbha grass (paristarana) with their ende turned to the south in the case of those that are placed to the north or south he spreads darbhas to the north. He places to the north-east or to the north-west of the dakṣiṇāgni singly the yajñapātras required in this rite on darbha grass viz. carusthalı, sūrpa, sphya, mortar and pestle, sruve, dhruvā, antelope-skin, fuel-sticks cut off at one stroke, mekṣana, kamandalu, and whatever else may be Decessary. The adhvaryu going to the south of the sakata (the wooden frame on which the paddy is stored and which is to the West of the fire ) fills the carusthall (vessel for cooking rice ) that is placed on the sūrpa with paddy to the brimn and removes the grains ( that rise above the brim) on to the sūrpa (which overflowing grains are returned to the sakata ). The mortar is then placed on the black antelope-skin and the wife with her face to the south-east beats with the pestle the paddy grains</p>

Without trying to separate the husked grains from the unhusked ones the grains are washed once and cooked on the dakṣiṇa fire ( in such a way that the grains of rice are not entirely soft). He should draw with the sphya a line between the garbapatya and dakṣiṇa fires or to the south east of the latter with the words &rsquo;the asuras and evil-spirits that occupy the vedi are scattered away. (Vaj. S. II. 29 quoted in Sat. II. 7. p. 249 and Ap. I. 7. 13). He should then sprinkle that line ( as the vedi for this rite) with water, spread round it the darbha grass (out off with one stroke), take clarified butter in the dhruvā spoon, place it to the south of the dakṣiṇāgni, sprinkle on the mess of cooked rice clarified butter from the dhruvā. He places to the south of the dakṣiṇāgni, collyrium, unguents, &amp; mat and a pillow. Wearing the sacred thread in the prāolnāvita form ( acoord ing to Āp. I. 8. 3 and Sat. II. 7. p. 248 the adhvaryu wears it in the upavita form) he offers on the fire the idhma (i. e. fifteen fuel-stioks), takes a portion of the boiled rice with the mekṣaṇa, pours clarified butter over it, outs off two portions of the rice on it, again sprinkles clarified butter over 2438 the portions and the rice from which they are taken, offers into the dakṣiṇa fire one āhuti ( oblation) with the words &lsquo;Somāya pitsmate svadhā namah&rsquo;, then again sprinkles clari fied butter on the portion out off and offers it with the words &lsquo;Agnaye kavyavābanāy&amp; svadbā namaḥ&rsquo;. He 2488 then throws the mekṣana on to the fire. Then on the line made with the spbya he sprinkles water tbrioe 2434 with the mantras &ldquo;Sundbantām pitaraḥ, sundhantām pitamabāḥ, sundhantām prapitā mahāḥ (may the fathers, grand-fathers and great-grand-fathers wash themselves puro ).

The pinda ( ball of rice) for the great-grand father is the biggest of the three, that for the grand-father being larger than that for the father. There was a difference of view among the teacbers as to the procedure when any of the three ancestors was living, Gāpagāri holding that piṇdas were offered only to the deceased ancestors and he who was living was oply honoured, while Taulvali said that pindas were to be offered to three ancestors whether living or dead and Gautama stating that if any ancestor out of the first three above the sacrificer was alive, three pindas were to be offered and an ancestor beyond the great-grand-father may then be included. Aøv.(II. 6. 20-23) refutes all these views by saying that no pinda can be offered to any ancestor beyond the great-grand-father and none to those who are alive nor to any ancestor between whom and &amp; preceding ancestor &amp; living ancestor intervenes, but that the pindas meant for ancestors that are alive may be tbrown into fire (with spābā at the end and not svadha ). According to Ap. I. 9.8 and Sat. p. 252 if the householder&rsquo;s father be living he should not offer pindas but should stop after he performs the homa, If he has 2438 two fathers or grand fathers or great-grand-fathers (owing to adoption or niyoga) he should take two names with reference to the pinda offered to that ancestor. When the pindas are placed on the line referred to above he invokes the piṇdas with a formula. Here you may regale yourselves, O pitfs and may you partake according to your shares&rsquo; (Vāj.S.11.31).8439 Then he turns round and faces the nortb, sits down holding his breath till he feels exhausted, then again turns round and faces the piṇdas and utters the invocation</p>

Then he should wait upon the pitṛs with salutation and mutter the mantra &lsquo;saluta tion to you, Pitrs, for ( securing ) food, salutation to you, Pitrs, for strength&rsquo; &amp;o. 1438 and also the three verses &lsquo;manonvā. huvāmabe&rsquo; (Rs. X. 57, 3-5 ).8488 He should then make the pitṛs start forward on a stream of water ( i. e. by pouring water on the pipdas) with the mantra O well-disposed pitys! May you depart away by the ancient and awe-inspiring paths, after bestowing on us wealth and welfare. May you send down to us prosperity including all manly sons&rsquo; (vide Tai. S. I. 8. 5. 2 for first half). He should walk a little towards the dakṣiṇāgni with the verse Rg. IV. 10.1 and then towards the gārbapatya with the mantra &lsquo;May the garbapatya fire deliver me from whatever sin I may have committed against Heaven and Earth, or parents and may the same fire make me sinless (Tai. S. I. 8.5.3). He should take hold of the middle piṇda with the words &lsquo;Opitre 1 bestow&rsquo;on me a valiant (son)&rsquo; and should make his wife eat that ball of rice with the mantra 2440</p>

<p>History of Dharmātāstra</p>
<p>(Ch. XXX</p>
<p>O pitsg1 may you deposit an embryo that will be a young boy wearing a lotus wreath, so that he may be unhurt&rsquo; ( compare Vaj. S. II. 33). The other two pindag may be thrown into water or fire or a person who has recently lost all appetite for food may eat the two or one who is harassed by some incurable disease ( such as leprosy or tuberculosis ) may eat them, the result being that he is either cured or dies. Kat. IV. 1. 20 adds that the adhvaryu collects the pindas in a pot and the house-holder bends down and takes the smell thereof. ** Then the darbha blades taken out with one stroke are thrown into the fire, the utensils are sprinkled with water and then taken up in twos and laid aside.</p>
<p>A householder who had not consecrated the three vedio fires also had to perform the piṇda-pitr-yajña on amāvāsya, but he offered it in the grhya fire. Vide Aśv, Sr. II. 7, 18, Sam. K. P. 838ff, Sam. Pr. 908 ff. Gaut. V. 5 prescribes that a house. holder should at least daily offer water to the pitrs and do more (i. e. offering food &amp;c.) according to his ability and inclination. Manu II. 176 prescribes daily pitr-tarpaṇa (satiating the pitre with water ), for which see pp. 668-69.</p>
