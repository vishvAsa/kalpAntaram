22. Jatukarnya 

Viśvarūpa (on Yāj. I. 4-5) quotes a verse of Vrudha Yājñavalkya in which Jātukarya is mentioned as an expounder of dharma.389 The name is variouly written as Jātūkarni or Jātākarnya or as Jatukarna. The Smyticandrikā quotes a passage from Angiras in which Jātūkarnya is enumerated among writers of Upasmrtis. Viśvarūpa quotes prose passages from Jātūkarnya a number of times.363 On Yāj. I. 1, he gives a sūtra about “pratilomas"; on Yāj. I. 2 there is & sūtra saying that a pupil should not all of a sudden put a question to his teacher in an assembly of people, on Yūj. I. 29 about a Ksatriya and Vaisya wearing an Upavita of hemp and wool when initiated for sacrifice, on Yāj. I. 37 as to the age when a Brāhmana became a vrūtya, about the prohibition of marrying another wife of a diferent caste when one has already married a savarṇa wife (on Yaj. I. 79 ), about the time for sraddhas (on Yaj. I. 215 ). These quota tions show that Jātukarṇya composed id sutra work on ācāra and srāddha, which was comparatively uncient. The quotations of Jātūkurnya in Mitāksari, Haradatta, A parārka,

28. Jātukarnya

and later writers are in verse and so it appears that by that time the work had been lost or forgotten. Aparārka (p. 423 ) quotes a verse of Jātūkarnya which refers to the zodiacal sign Virgo. This would place the verse Jātūkarnya not very much earlier than the 3rd or 4th century A. D. 

Maskarin on Gaut. Dh, S. quotes, on different sūtras, a number of verses e. g. on 10. 61 (three verses ), 14. 31, 15. 1, 21. 3, 22. 20-21 (two verses ), 22. 36 &c. The Smrti-can drikā quotes verses of Jātukarıya five times on Ahnika and twelve times on Sraddha and a prose passage ( Alnika p. 114, Gharpure's ed.) on what is meant by Uttariya (in Srauta or Smārta rites ). Aparārka (p. 1069 on Yāj. III. 253 ) quotes a verse of J. that if a boy whose upanuyanu had not been perfo rmed drinks by mistake liquor the prayascitta is three krc chras to be undergone by the boy's mother, brother or father. Viśvarūpa quotes several prose passages of Jātākarụya ( vol. 1. pp. 7, 46, 48, 144 on Sraddha), while Mit. quotes several verses on Yāj. I. 256, III. 17, 30, 253, 259-60. The name Jātūkarnya is an ancient one. The Kītyāyana Srautasūtra (IV. 1. 23 ft) 204 mentions the view of Jātukarnya on pinda pitryajñol when all the three paternal ancestors of the performer are not deal and the Kalpataru on Srāddha (p. 240) remarks 'Jivatpit;kasya trayah pakśāṇ'.
