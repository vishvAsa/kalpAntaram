28. Satatapa Śatātapa is enumerated among the expounders of dharma by Yāj. (I. 4-5) and by Parasura. Viśvarūpa, Haradatta and Aparārka quote several proge passages of Śatātapa on prāyascitta. Viśvarūpa (on Yāj. III. 236 ) tells us that Śatātapa -spoke of only eight, upapatakas and that without dealing with śrāddha as a principal topic he spoke of some of the subsidiary details of srāddha.294 The latter passage quoted from Sātātāpa is a half verse. So Viśvarūpa had a prose work of Sātītapa before him, mixed with verses, Haradatta on Gaut. ( Dh. S. 22. 18 ) quotes a prose passage of Sātāta pa about the penance for killing a cow. Viśvarūpa on Yaj. III. 236 (part II. p. 93 ) states that Sātata pa mentioned in a prose passage only eight. Upapatakas .Sātātape tu. astum. vevopapātakāpyuktāni, athopa pātakānyagnyutsūdītyādini' eko. Viśvarūpa on Yaj. III. 262 (part.2, p. 148) mentions a gutre of Śatātapa on prāyuścittu. Maskarī on Gaut. 23. 35 quotes a prose passage from S. on prāyaścıttas unudaka-mutrapu. risayrabane svakakasparśane Sacelasuinam mahā vyābrti. homuśca rajasvulnyamane cartildevann'. The Layhu-Satūta pa smrti (Anan. collection) contains several verses of Manu (e.g. verses 103, 105, 107 of it are respectively the girme as Mapu Ill, 237, III. 174, III. 233 and verses 45 and 58 refer to Śatātapa. Vfudba-Sātutupa is quoted several times in Kalpana taru e. g. ou pp. 98-99 of Brahma', on pp. 286, 405 of Grbus tha, 6 times on Sraddha. It is interesting to note that a verse of Satata pa quoted by the Mit. on Yāj. 1. 192 provides that a prāyasetta is not prescribed for men who bathe iri exidvink tbe water from a well or a dam dug or constructed by antyajus. The Mit. on Yāj. quotes several prose passages of

Śatātapa on III. 243, 254, 263-64. In the Mit., the Smirtis candrikā and other works numerous verses of Śatātapa are quoted on ācāra and śrāddha. This work of Śatātapa in verse is most probably a different one from the sūtra work. It appears that there are several smitis ascribed to Śatātapa. In Jivananda's collection there is a smrti of Śatātapa called Karmavipāka in six chapters and about 231 verses. Its contents are: certain diseases are concomitants of certain sins; gifts of land, cows &c.; eulogy of Brāhmanas; penances for killing a brahmana, a cow &c., penances for drinking wine, for incest and forbidden sexual intercourse of various sorts, for thefts; rites for those who meet with violent and accidental death. The last verse declares that the Smrti was promulgated by Śatātapa to his pupil Sarabharga. It is a late production. It prescribes the reading of the Harivassa ( II. 30 ) as a penance for infanticide. Vide below under Madanapāla. 

No. 1362 of the I. O. catalogue (and cat. of Madras Govt. msg. vol. V. pp. 1994. 96 ) is a Śatātapa--empti in twelve chap ters dealing with prāyaścittas for mahāpātakas, prāyaścittas for injuries to various beings, marriage, vaisvadeva, srāddha, pitstarpana, rules about taking one's dinner, prāyaścitta for dogbites and similar mitters; impurity on hirth and death, rules of conduct ( Ācāra ). 

No. 1361 of the I. O. catalogue is a treatise in mixed pross and verse on prāyaścittas for the Mahāpātakas and Upapa takas. Several verses of Manu ( such as III, 8, 11, 171 ) occur therein. It contains 139 verses. In Mitra's Notices ( II. p. 41) there is a ms. called Karmavipāka in 87 chapters and 2376 verses, of which the work in Jivananda's collection seems to be a part or abridgment. 

Aparārka in several places quotes the views of Śatātapa immediately followed by quotations from Vīddha-Śatātapa or vice versa (e. g. on Yāj. I. 190, on III. 292 p. 1195 and p. 1201 ). 

No. 205 of A. 1882-83 of the Deccan College Collection is a Vrdilha-Siitātepa smrti in 64 verses on prāyaścittas for doing various things, on śrāddha, on washing the teeth. Her Cat. No. 1360 p. 398 is a Vrddha-Śatātapa-smști in 97 verheerse on defilement and purifications. The Anandāsrama collection 

296 



contains a Vrddha-Śatātapa smrti in 68 verses ( pp. 232-235) on prāyaścittas, purification from various defilements and other miscellaneous matters. There are two prose passages therein. 

Hemādri mentions a Vrddha-Satātapa along with several other smrtikāras (vide note 278 above). In the Vyavahāra mātrkā of Jimutavāhana (p. 305 ) Vrddha-Śatātapa is cited on the six kinds of uttura (defendant's reply ).296 This shows that Vṭddha-Śatātapa wrote on Vyavahāra also. 

The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 290 ) cites a Bṛbat-Śatātapa. 

Hemādri (III, 1. 801) speaks of a bhāsyakāra of Vrddha Sātātape.
