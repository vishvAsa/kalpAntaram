57. Harīta The verse quotations from Hārīta on topics of vyavahāra deserve some treatment. He defines vyavahāra as that where by the recovery of one's own wealth and the avoidance of (doing ) the duties peculiar to another (caste or class ) are effected in due course of law.878 He further says that that judicial proceeding is proper which is based on the dictates of dharmaśāstra and arthasāstra, which is in conformity with the usages of respectable people and which is free from fraud.978 Hārita calls upon the king to know the sāstras, the

duties of the varṇas and of the lowest castes.880 He, like Nārada, said that vynvahāru had four aspects, each succeeding one prevailing against the preceding one,ssl viz., dharma, vyavahāra, caritra, nạpājīa. He attached the greatest im portance to writing and said that a transaction cousigned to writing is effective even after great lapse of time and that he who bas a writing in his hands is entitled to possession (pro bably in cases of mortgages and pledges ).882 He lays down very elaborate rules about the requisites and defects of plaints, about summoning the defendant, about the contents, faults and kinds of the defendant's reply, and about the bur den of proof.683 He protects long possession of property even if it originated without title provided it had lasted for three generations.084 He says that the title is the decisive factor as to various kinds of possession, viz., when possession is for cibly taken by soldiers and freebooters, when a thing is stolen or kept concealed, when it was delivered through affection and friendship or when it was lent on hire, or when it was handed over for wearing or safe custody or was borrowed through friendship.085 To illustrate the relation of title and possession he uses a very apt figure, viz. just as a branch cannot be seen expanding in the sky unless it is supported by the roots, so title is the root and possession is its offshoot.

According to him sureties are of five kinds,686 abhaya (for keeping the peace), pratyaya ( for confidence ), dāna ( return of money or carrying out one's obligations ), upast bāna ( return of money lent on pledge ) and darśana ( for appearance ). He prescribed an absolute tutelage for women as regards the giving a way of the husband's wealth and allow. ed only maintenance to a young window of improper conduct.887 But Hārīta was humane in his treatment of even erring wives. He does not allow a husband to cast adrift an adulterous wife and prescribes that she should be given food to keep body and soul together and bare clothes.688 

It appears from the above that Harita the jurist must have flourished nearly at the same time as Brhasrati and Kātyāyana, i. e. between 400 and 700 A. D.
