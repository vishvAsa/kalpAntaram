48. Prajapati Prajāpati is cited as an authority by the Baudhāyana dharinasūtra (II. 4. 15 and II. 10. 71 ). Vasistha several times quotes Prājāpatya blokas (viz. III. 47, XIV. 16-19, 24-27, 30-32). It has been shown above that most of these Verses are found in the Manusmrti or have close correspon dence with verses of Manu. So it is not unlikely that both the writers of dharmasūtras mean Manu by Prajāpati. 

In the Anandāśrama collection (p. 90-98 ) there is a smrti of Prajāpati in 198 verses on the various details of frāddha, such as the time, place, the persons authorised to perform, proper food, Brāhmanas to be invited etc. The pre vailing metre is Auustubh, but there are nine verses in the Indravajrā, Upajāti, Vasantatilakā (verse 137 ) and Sragdharā (verse 96 ). It speaks of Kalpaśāstra, smrtis, dharmaśāstra, purāṇas. It contains a verse referring to the Kanya and Vrścika ( scorpion ) signs of the Zodiac, which is almost the same as a verse of Kārśṇājini.

48. Prajāpati 

521 

The Mit. (on Yāj. III. 25 and 260 ) quotes verses of Prajā pati on āśauca and prāyaścittu. Aparārka cites verses of Prajāpati on purification of various substances, on érāddha, witnesses, ordeals and āśauca. None of these is traced to the printed text of Prajāpati. A parārka (p. 952 ) gives a long prose text of Prajāpati on the four orders of parivrājakas, viz. kuticaka, bahudaka, hamsa, paramahamsa. Aparārka (p. 542) cites a verge of Laugākṣi which refers to the view of Prajā pati that the son of a putrika was to offer pindas to his mother by the gotra of his maternal grand-father.s13 Aparārka, Smrti. candrikā, Parāśara-Mādhaviya and other works quote several verses of Prajāpati on vyavahāra. Wituesses are of two kinds, krta and akrta.814 In this he seems to have followed Narada (rnadana, verse 149). Prajapati lays down the characteri stics of valid reply ( uttara ) of the defendant and defines 818 the four varieties of uttara. The Parāśara-Madhaviya cites several verses of Prajāpati on ordeals. Prajāpati recognised the right of the sonless widow to succeed to her husband's wealth018 and enjoined on her the duty of offering frāddha every month and year to her husband's manes and to honour his relatives.817
