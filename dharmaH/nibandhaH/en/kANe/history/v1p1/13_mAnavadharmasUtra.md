+++ Mānava-dharma-sūtra — Did it exist?

Following the orthodox view of Western Sanskrit scholars that most of the dharmasūtras are older than almost all, if not all, the metrical smṛtis, I gave the first place of honour to the dharmasūtras of Gautama and others.   
But my own views differ to a great extent from those of the orthodox school of Sanskritists represented by Max Müller and Bühler.   
It is high time to state here my views about the existence of a Mānava-dharma-sūtra supposed to be the original of our extant Manu.

Some western scholars, particularly Max Müller and Weber, started the ingenious theory that the extant Manusmṛti was a recast or remodeling of an ancient Mānava-dharma-sūtra. Max Müller went so far as to enunciate the bold generalisation   

>“There can be no doubt, however, that all the genuine dharma-śāstras which we possess now, are **without any exception**, nothing but more modern texts of earlier sūtra works on khandikārams belonging originally to certain Vedic caranas”  
-(H.A.S.L. pp. 134–135).  

For this sweeping generalisation there were very few data when it was made, as admitted by Bühler. This theory of Max Müller was as hasty, as unfounded and as uncritical as several other theories of his such as that 
- about the renaissance of Sanskrit Literature in the early centuries of the Christian era, 
- about the absence of the art of writing in India before Pāṇini, and 
- about the uniform employment of the śloka for literary purposes in his so-called sūtra period and earlier.  

Western scholars had to give up such theories before the stern logic of facts, but they have tenaciously clung to the theory about the Manusmṛti being a recast of the Mānava-dharma-sūtra.

One main plank of Max Müller’s edifice was the now exploded theory about the non-employment of the anuṣṭubh during the sūtra period which he tentatively placed between **600 B.C. – 200 B.C.** for continuous composition.  
In spite of the fact that the whole edifice has totally collapsed, Bühler makes strenuous efforts to rehabilitate Max Müller’s theory by additional a priori arguments (S.B.E. vol. 25, pp. xviii–xxiii and xxxii–xxxv).  

The main points brought forward by Bühler are:— 
1. The Vasiṣṭha Dh. S. (V. 5–8) contains four sūtras, the first of which is:  
    > “The Manava says that one may kill an animal only in honouring the Manes, gods and guests”

    There follow two verses and a passage in prose with iti at the end. Bühler argues that all the four sūtras are quotations and as the extant Manusmrti is in verse, they must be regarded as taken from the Mānavadharma sūtra. 
  
2. There are other quotations in Vasiṣṭha attributed to Manu which either   contradict the present Manusmṛti or have no counterpart in the latter.  
    Bühler draws special attention to the fact that Vasiṣṭha (19, 37) quotes & Mānava śloka which is not in the anuṣṭubh metre and which has nothing corresponding to it in the extant Manusmṛti.  

3. A fragment of Uśanas quotes an opinion of Manu about impurity, which is in prose.[^144] Bühler himself points out that here one ms. reads 'Sumantuḥ' for Manuḥ.   
    Therefore, this argument is of very little use in establishing the existence of a Mānavadharmasūtra. Besides, it is possible that the mutilated passage is not a quotation at all, but a mere summary of Manu's views. There is no 'iti' at the end to show that it is a quotation.  

4. Kāmandakīya Nītisāra (II. 3) says that according to the Mānavas the vidyās to be studied by a king are three -  
    >viz. the three   Vedas, Vārtā, and Daṇḍanīti, 

    and that what is called Ānvīkṣikī is but a branch of trayī;  
    while the Manusmṛti ( 7. 43 ) appear to regard the four as distinct vidyās.[^145]  
    Kāmandaka (XI. 67 ) says that Manu prescribed that the council of ministers should consist of twelve ;[^146] while Manu (7. 54 ) says that the 'sacivas' should be seven or eight. 

Biihler therefore argues that Kāmandaka has in mind the Mānavadharmasūtra and not the Manusmṛti and on the word 'Mānavaḥ' makes the following observations:

> “It is a very common practice of Indian authors to refer in this manner to the books restricted to special schools. But I know of no case where the doctrines of the Mānava­dharmaśāstra or of any other work, which is destined for all Āryans and acknowledged as authoritative by all, are cited in the same or similar way.”  
— S. B. E., vol. 25, p. XXXVII

In the first place, it has to be noted that Kāmandaka is only paraphrasing the words of Kauṭilya in the above two places.[^147]

Further, it is noteworthy that Kāmandaka employs the word 'Manuḥ', while Kauṭilya uses the word Mānavaḥ (about the number of ministers). Therefore, according to the Kāmandakīya­nīti­sāra, there was no difference between the two — viz. the words Manuḥ and Mānavaḥ denoted the same thing: a work.

What Bühler means by his emphasis on the word 'Mānavaḥ' is not quite clear. Early writers like Kumārila and Viśvarūpa employ the word 'Mānavaṃ' with reference to the Manusmṛti, just as they use the word Vāsiṣṭhaṃ to denote the Vūsisthadharmasūtra (vide Tantra­vārttika pp. 167, 194, and Viśvarūpa on Yāj. (Yājñavalkya Smṛti) III. 245 and 257).

Śaṅkara, in his bhāṣya on Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad I.4.17, applies the word 'Mānava' to the Manusmṛti:

>Mānava ca sarvaḥ pravrttih kūmahetukyeveti (referring to Manu II.4)

Besides, there is hardly any conflict between the views of the Mānavas and the Manusmṛti on the point of the number of the vidyās. The Mānavas knew that Anvīkṣikī was counted as a fourth vidyā, but said that it was really comprehended in the study of the Vedas.

The Manusmṛti only lays down from whom the vidyās were to be learnt. As regards the number of ministers, we cannot afford to forget that the Manusmṛti (7.60) allows more ministers than seven or eight.

Another explanation also is possible. In the final remodelling of the Manusmṛti from its original verse, it is not unlikely that a few changes were made. (V)  On the strength of the preser vation of the complete set of the sūtra works of Apastamba on srauta, grhya and dharma (also of Baudhāyana and Hira ụyakesin ), it is urged that the Mānava carana had a sūtia on dharma.
 
The Mānava­dharmasūtra (parts 1–5 edited by Dr. Knauer and the chayana by Miss Gelder at Leipzig in 1921) and the Mānava-gṛhyasūtra (edited by Dr. Knauer in 1897 and recently in the Gaikwad Oriental Series) are extant. Bühler admits (S. B. E. vol. 25, p. XXXVIII) that the main pillars of his arguments are the quotations ascribed to Manu in the Vasisthadharmasūtra.

The four sūtras of Vasistha (IV. 5-8) which are the sheet anchor of Bühler's argument have been dealt with above under Vasistha (pp. 102 ff¹). If, as Bühler says, the four sūtras are one quotation, since ‘iti' occurs at the end of the 8th sūtra, then we have here a quotation within a quotation, as 'iti' occurs also in sūtra 5. But this would be absurd. Besides, sūtra 8 is really summarised from some Brāhmaṇa passage as indicated above.   

The proper construction of the four sūtras is as follows:- 

>The fifth sūtra merely summarises the views of the Manusmrti to be gathered from Manu V. 41 and 48. The word 'Mānavam' stands for the Manusmrti just as it does in the Tantravārttika and in Viśvarūpa. Then the two verses of Manu are quoted. In the 8th sūtra a Brāhmaṇa passage is cited in support of the position that sacrificing an animal is not 'killing' (that leads to sin).

As regards the few quotations which cannot be found in the extant Manusmrti the following points deserve consideration. The Vasisthadharmasūtra contains numerous verses identical with those of the Manusmrti. Most of the quotations attributed to Manu are found in the Manusmrti. Hence even if a few quotations are not found in our Manu, we cannot at once jump to the conclusion that Vasistha had before him not the Manusmrti, but the Mānavadharma sūtra. Besides, Bühler is not right in saying that Vasistha 11. 23, 12. 16 and 23. 43 either contradict or find no counterpart in our Manu (S. B. E. vol. 25, p. XXXIV). Vasistha 11. 23 corresponds with Manu 3. 245-246.[^148]   

None of the three contradicts anything contained in the Manusmṛti.  

Vasiṣṭha 23.43 (about Śiśukrccha) has nothing corresponding to it word for word in our Manu, but it seems to be an echo of Manu 11.211.[^149] In Vasiṣṭha 12.16 (paryagīrahatna-hy-etana-manurha Prajāpatiḥ) there is nothing that contradicts our Manu; that half and the preceding verses bear a close correspondence to Baudhāyana Dh. S. I.4.2. Similarly, Bühler’s argument about Mānava śloka in the Tṛṣṭubh metre is not quite sound. The text of Vasiṣṭha is far from satisfactory.
On the non-occurrence of that verse or a corresponding śloka in our Manu, no superstructure can be built. Vasiṣṭha quotes (4.37) a sūtra or opinion of Gautama which is not found in the
extant Gautamadharmasūtra. Verses ascribed to Vasiṣṭha in the nibandhas are not found in the printed text of Vasiṣṭha.

The analogy of the works of the schools of Āpastamba and others can furnish no proof. There are, on the other hand, weighty grounds for discarding that analogy altogether. It is a remarkable
fact that, excepting the three caranas (of the Black Yajurveda) of Āpastamba, Baudhāyana, and Hiraṇyakeśin that arose and flourished in the southern portion of India, no carana of any of
the other Vedas has an extant dharmasūtra ascribed to the founder of the sūtra-carana. An explanation is suggested in the following lines. 

The Brāhmaṇas in southern India were, in the very early days of their colonisation, surrounded by an alien culture and by alien customs. It was necessary therefore to formulate distinctly the rules of general conduct for the Aryan community in southern India, that studied the Black Yajurveda.   
The same necessity did not exist in northern India, where the members of the sūtracaranas knew their ordinary every day duties very well, and were more or less a homogeneous community with the same ideals and culture. Therefore, in the begginning when manuals of Śrauta and Gṛhya ceremonies were first com- posed, it was not thought necessary to compose set treatises on dharma for each carana. Some of the rules of conduct were embodied in the gṛhya sūtras because they were germane to the subjects treated of in them (such as the duties of brah- macārins and householders, holidays etc.).  
Works, however, dealing with the general usages prevalent among the Aryan community in various parts of northern India must have been composed early enough. When the knowledge of the existe- nce of the complete set of the sūtra works in the Āpastamba and other caranas of the Yajurveda in southern India perme- ated to northern and central India, the leaders of the caranas cast about for works that would complete the works of their caranas and bring them in a line with those of Āpastamba and others. Therefore the various caranas seized upon seve- ral dharmasūtras and adopted them in their schools for study. This must have occurred at a comparatively early date. For Kumārila, as we saw above, enlightens us as to what dharma- sūtras were specially studied in which Vedic schools.     
The fact that, though Gautama and Vasiṣṭha are said to have been specially studied by the students of the Sāmaveda and the Ṛgveda respectively, there is hardly anything in these dharma- sūtras that specially connects them with the two Vedas affo- rds some corroboration of the above hypothesis. This assimi- lation of independent dharmasūtras into individual sūtracara- ṇas probably took place before or in the first centuries of the Christian era. Śabara (on Jaimini I. 3.4) seems to make fun of the dharmasūtras when he says that the direction to observe brahmacarya for forty-eight years was a device of those who wanted to hide their impotence (Gautama 2. 52, Āp. Dh. S. I. 1. 2. 11-12, Baud. Dh. S. I. 2. 1 speak of brahmacarya for 48 years). This shows that these dharmasūtras could not have been regarded as very authoritative by all early writers. Jaimini I. 3. 11 (according to Śabara) denies the independent authority of Kalpasūtras. It appears that the Mānava school, which according to the Caranavyūha was a sub-division of the Maitrāyaṇīya, dwindled in numbers very early. Kumārila, who was a most learned and profound stu- dent of the various branches of Sanskrit literature, nowhere mentioned the Mānavadharmasūtra as studied by followers of the Black Yajurveda, though he mentions Baudhāyana and Āpastamba as studied by them. He places the Manusmṛti even higher than the Gautamadharmasūtra and betrays no knowledge of the existeuee of the Mānavadharmasūtra. Viśva- rūpa who is generally identified with Sureśvara, the pupil of Śankara, remarks that the Mānavacaraṇa is not existent (or found).[^150]
The foregoing discussion will, it is hoped, induce every impartial critic to endorse the conclusion that, on the materials so far available, the theory that the Mānavadharmasūtra once existed and that the extant Manusmrti is a recast of that sūtra must be held not proved.

[^144]: In No. 644 of Vīrasaṁbāg (1) in the Deccan College there is a fragment of Uśanas where we read:
उरस्कृत्य ... (gap) मनुराह । बाले देशान्तरस्थे चानग्निके वोराच्चाने (?) अनाशकेग्रिप्रवेशे युद्धहते च सद्यः शौचम्.  
The words बाले देशान्तरस्थे occur in Manu 5.78 in the same connection.  
For the rest, compare Manu 5.93 and 5.95.  
We must probably read:  
देशान्तरस्थे च साग्रिके  
No. 191 of A. 1881–82 is another fragment of Uśanas containing the same   passage. Bühler’s mss. read सद्य: शौचनष्टपनिवाभिननिन्दिताचारैने सह संवसेत् and he proposes शौचमिष्टमिति |

[^145]: The words of the Manusmṛti are:
त्रैविद्येम्यस्त्रथी विद्यां दण्डनीतिं च शाश्वतीम् |  
आन्वीक्षिकीं चात्मविद्यां वार्तारम्भाश्च लोकत ||  

[^146]: कामन्दक says:
द्वादशेति मनु: प्राह षोडशेनि वृहस्पति: |  
उशना विंशतिरिति मन्त्रिणां मन्त्रिमण्डलम् ||

[^147]: 'त्रयी वार्त्ता दण्डनीतिश्चेति मानवाः । त्रयीविषेपो ह्यन्वीक्षिकीति' कौटिल्य I, 2; 'मन्त्रिपरिषदं द्वादशामात्यान् कुर्वीतेति मानवाः; षोडशेति बार्हस्पत्याः; विंशतिरित्यौशनसाः' कौटिल्य I, 15.

वसिष्ठ 11. 23. Should we not read स्वदवंश्यानाम्, which would correspond to the word दासवर्गे in Manu?   
मनु reads 
'असं स्कृतप्रमीतानां त्यागिनां कुल्योषिणाम् ।

3.245-246. The close correspondence between Vas. and Manu in ideas and phraseology should be specially marked.

It would be noticed that the शिसकृच्छ्र comes to one-third of the प्राजापत्यकृच्छ्र, as the शिशु चान्द्रायण (मनु. 11. 218) is a milder edition of the चान्द्रायण. The प्रायश्चित्त for minors and women was one-half or one-third of that for adult males (vide बी. ध. सू. II, 1. 51. and आङ्गरसस्मृति verse 33 ); बौ. ध. सू. (II. 1.65) describes the four day's observance as the कृच्छ्र for women, minors, and old men. याज्ञ. III, 319 calls it पादकृच्छ्र.
