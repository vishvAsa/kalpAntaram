19. Kasyapa and Kasyapa Baudhayana ( Dh. S. I. 11. 20) cites a verse which con tains the view of Kaśyapa that a woman who is bought can. not be a patnī and that she is not authorised to take part in religious ( daiva ) rites or rites for the Manes.254 This verse is ascribed to Katyayana in the Smrticandrika ( I. p. 87 ). The Vanaparva quotes gāthcs of Kāśyapa on forbearance ( 29. 35-40). Whether Kaśyapa and Kāśyapa are two different writers of dharmasūtras it is rather difficult to say. Probably they are identical. It appears that the dharmasūtra of Kāśyapa comprised all the usual topics of dharmasūtras, such as daily duties, sraddha, asauca, prayascitta. This sutra has been quoted by all eminent writers from Viśvarūpa down wards. Viśvarāpa quotes Kasyapa (in prose ) on the priya scitta for contact with candila 8866 and for killing a cow when the sinner is a brāhmana or a member of another caste. 288 The Mit. (on Yaj. III. 23) quotes a prose passage from Kāsyapa on freedom from impurity on death of infants.257 The quotations in the Smṛticandrikā on āhnika and traddha are all in verse. Haradatta on Gautama (22. 18 ) quotes a sūtra on the prāyaścitta for govadhu, 258 which is also quoted by Viśvarūpa. Haradatta (on Gaut. 23. 26 ) quotes a very long sūtra on the prāyascittu for eating several things and doing 

254 क्रीता द्रव्येण या नारी सा न पत्नी विधीयते । 

सा न दैवे न सा पित्र्ये दासी तो कश्यपोब्रवीत् ॥ 255 चण्डालश्वपाकपुल्कसादिसंकरे सव्यवधाने षण्मासान् गोमूत्रयावकाः पश्चाहकालं 

पातव्याः। एवं प्रतिमासवृद्ध्या वृद्धिरा परिवृत्तः सूर्यरय । विश्वरूप on याज्ञ. 

III. 257. 258 प्रायश्चितमकामावाप्तौ कामकृतेप्येके । ... ब्राह्मणेभ्यो निवेदयित्वा सशिखं वपनं 

कृत्वा प्राजापत्यं कृच्छ्रमाचरेत् । चीर्णान्ते धेनुं तिलधेनुं दद्यात् । इति काश्यपः । अथान्यो वर्णः तेन चर्मणा प्रावृतो मासं गोष्ठे वसेत् ( long prose ) ।

several forbidden acts.250 Haradatta (on An. Dh. S. II. 6.13. 2 ) quotes several verses mentioning the seven kinds of punar bhūs. The Hāralatii quotes a sūtra from Kaśyapa on āsauca. Aparārka quotes several sūtras and a few verses under both names Kaýyapa and Kaśyapa (vide Yāj. I. 64, III. 265, III. 21, 25, 251, 288, 290, 292 ). 

In the Deccan College collection there are two mss. (No. 200 of 1884-87 and No. 122 of A. 1881-82) which contain a Kāśyapaṣmṛti in prose (4. folios having 8 lines on each side ). It begins'athātaḥ Kāśyapiyān grhasthadharmān vyākhyāsya maḥ'. It deals with the duties of householders, with prāya Ścittas for doing mischief to wells, dikes, ponds, temples and houses of Brahmanas, for killing a cow and other beasts and birds, with rules on mourning after death and impurity on birth, with prāyaścittas for eating garlic and other similar things, with the five mortal sins, with priyaścittas when such portents as earthquakes, lightning flashes occur, or for such accidental occurrences as the breaking of the milk pot, with purification of vessels of wood and inetals, with the visible physical sins and sing committed in previous lives, with the seven punarbhūs. 

In this work some of the sūtras quoted as Kāṣyapa's in the cominenturies are found (e. q. the quotation No. 259 "lasuna' &c. above ). So also the verses about punarbhūs of seven kinds quoted by Haradatta are found in the mss. In this sinti, Kiiśyapa is frequently cited as an authority. 

Maskarin on Gaut. 23. 19 quotes a verse of Kāśyapa providing priyaścitta for homo-sexuality and masturbation. 

“Pumsi maithunamāsevya yatnotsarge krte tathā / 

brahmacāri tathābhyesāt snātvātha havisā yajet Il". 

The Vanaparva ( 29. 35-40) sets out five gathās which Kāśyapa declared about keunā (forbearance or mildness ). Two of the five verses on kṣamā are quoted below :* 259 लशुनपलाण्डुगृजनकुक्कटभक्षणे मेदःशुक्रपानेऽयाज्ययाजनेऽभोज्यभोजनेऽभक्ष्यभक्ष 

णेऽगम्यागमने चैवं प्रायश्चित्तं ब्राह्मणेभ्यो निवेद्य पडात्रोपोषितवीर्णान्ते प्राच्या मुदीच्या दिशि गत्वा यत्र ग्राम्यपशूनां शब्दो न श्रूयते तस्मिन्देशेमिं प्रज्वाल्य ब्रह्मासनमास्तीर्य तत्प्रणीतेन विधिना पुनःसंस्कारमहेति । क्षमा धर्मः क्षमा यज्ञः क्षमा वेदाः क्षमा श्रुतम् ।... क्षमा तेजस्विनी तेजः क्षमा 

7917791H Tape 29. 36 and 40. The Udyogaparva ( 38.48 ) portale out odo defect about forbearance or mildness : Jef: Taat द्वितीयो नोपपद्यते । यदेनं क्षमया युक्तमशक्तं मन्यते जनः ॥

Prof. T. R. Chintamani contributed a paper (in which he edited a Dharma--śāstra based on four mss. ) to the J. O. R. (Madras) vol. XIII. pp. 267-282 with an appendix containing passages and verses attributed to Kāśyapa (pp. 283-292 ) by Viśvarūpa, Vijñāneśvara, Aparārka and others not found in those mss. Aparārka mentions Kāśyapa 13 times ( almost all verses except on p. 922 which is in prose) and Kaśyapa six times. 

It is to be noted that Kāśyapa is not mentioned by Yāj. as one of the dharmaśāstraprayojakas, though Parāśara (chap. I. 13) mentions Kāśyapā dharmāḥ. The Smṛticandrikā (I. p. 1) and the Sarasvativilāsa (p. 13 ) speak of 18 Upasmrtis in which Kāśyapa's is included.
