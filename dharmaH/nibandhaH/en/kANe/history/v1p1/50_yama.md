50. Yama 

The Vasistha-dharmasutra (18. 13-15 and 19. 48 ) cites four slokas of Yama and quotes (11. 20 ) one verse in which Yama is spoken of as an authority. All the slokas except one

are found in Manu.622 Vasistha quotes a bloka of Prajapati wherein Yama's view is set forth. Yama is one of the sages enumerated in the list of Yājñavalkya. Govinderāja (on 

Manu 5. 16) and Aparārka quote a verse of Saṅkha wherein Yama's view that the flesh of certain birds could be eaten is referred to.613 Aparārka (p. 1231 ) also cites & verse of Saṅkba in which the view of Bhagavān Yama that one should save one's life in all ways (even by incurring sin ) is relied upon. 

___ In Jivananda's collection (part I. pp. 560-568) there is a smrti of Yama in seventyeight verses on prāyaścitta and purification ( buddhi). In the smṛti Yama himself is cited in the third person ( verse 65 ). One verse ( 33 ) refers to the view of Bhāsvati (son of the Sun, by which may be meant either Manu or Yama himself ).84 Some of the verses are identical with those of Manu (e. g. verses 26, 28 are the same as Manu 11. 178 and 3. 19). Verse 44 is in the Upajāti metre. In the Anandasrama collection there is a Yamasmrti in 99 verses on prāyaścitta, śrāddha and purification. Most of the topics of this smrti are the same as those of the Calcutta text, but most of the verses are not identical. A few

verses are found in both, e. g. the verses about the seven lowest casteg625 ( antyajas ). Verse 11 quotes the view of Śatātapa. This Smṛti contains the well-known text that * woman passes on marriage into the gotra of her husband, which is cited by the Mit. (on Yaj. I. 254 ).828 In the same collection there is a smṛti of Bṛhad-Yama (pp. 99-107 ). It is divided into five chapters and contains 182 verses. It deals with prāyaścittas for various lapses, purification from various kinds of contacts (suddhi), srāddha, partition and a few matters of medical procedure. In this suști Yama is frequently cited by name. Śatātapa is cited on partition ( V. 20). Many of the verses of this text are identical with those of Yama in Jivananda's text. For example, Jivananda (p. 561 ) verses 15-17 are the same as Brbad-Yama III. 1-3, Jivananda p. 563 verses 29-33 are the same as Brhad-Yama III. 34-38, Jivananda verses 35-36 are the same as Brhad-Yama III. 16–17. The verse in the Upajāti metre, Jivananda 44 ) is Brhad-Yama III. 61. Two of the verses at the end of chap. V. are the same as Yāj. II. 17 and 23. 

The pumerous m88. of Yama contain either one or other of the above three texts or different texts bearing on the same topics. For example, the Govt. Mos. Collection at the Bhandarkar Institute, Nos. 209-211 of A 1881-82 and No. 153 of 1895-1902 are the same as the Yamasmrti in the Anandā srama collection. No. 401 of 1891-95 seems to be the same as Brhad-Yama in the Anandāsrama collection. But the I. O. Cat. No. 1334 p. 390 contains 37 slokas, the last 20 of which are in the Indravajrā metre. 

Viśvarūpa, Vijñāneśvara, Aparārka, the Smṛticandrikā and other later works quote over three hundred verses of Yama on all topics of dharmaśāstra including vyavahāra. This establishes that they had an extensive work of Yama before them from which it is probable that various abridgments corresponding with the printed works were made. Viśvarūpa quotes about ten verses of Yama on water as purifier (on Yāj.

1, 187 ), on srāddha ( on Yāj. I 225 and 252 ) and on prāya. scitta for killing a cow (on Yaj. III. 262). The identical verses are not found in the printed texts. Some of the verses quoted from Yama in Aparārka and the Smṛticandrikā can be traced in the printed text. For example, Aparārka (p. 42 ) quotes a verse of Yama in which Yama himself is referred to as an authority.sa7 It occurs in Jivananda's text (verse 65 ). The two verses in Jivananda's text ( verses 26, 28) that are identical with Manu are cited in the Smṛticandrikā 88 Yama's. Aparārka p. 1135 quotes a prose passage of Yama, यमः- वृक्षलतागुल्मछेदने वृद्धकृच्छकः फलवतां प्राजापत्यम् :- Two verses of Brhad-Yama ( III. 20-21 ) about the proper age of marriage in the case of girls are quoted as Yama's in the Smrti. candrikā.628 In some of the verses quoted by Aparārka from Yama, the opinions of Manu are cited which can be identified with the views of the Manusmrti. For example, according to Yama food polluted by the touch of hair, moths and insects, or seen by sinners and women in their courses is purified by water, holy ashes etc.628 This refers to Manu V, 125. Similarly, the Smṛticandrikā quotes a verse of Yama which says that according to Manu those who administer poison, who are incendiaries and robbers and those guilty of homicide and abetment thereof should pay the extreme penalty of death.630 Aparārka (p. 988 on Yaj. III. 109) quotes five verses of Yama which refer to the 26 tattvas well-known in the Saṅkhya system, regard Purusottama as a 26th tuttva and propound that he who correctly understands the 25 tattvas, in whatever aśrama he may be, reaches the highest abode of Viṇṇu. Aparārka quotes a few prose passages from Yama on the garments to be worn by brahmacārins,831 on prāyascitta

for killing various kind of birds and insects, for cutting trees and bushes, for drinking wine, for stealing gold and for the other deadly sins etc. 632 

The Anulisanaparva of the Mahābhārata (Chap. 104 verse 72 ) states that those who are conversant with ancient times recited verses (gūthūs ) of Yama and then follow 84 verses which are more or less like verses found in several smrtis e. g. the verse 'ūrdhyam prānā... pratipadyate' occurs as Anuśāsana 104. 64-65 (and is Manu II. 120 ); so also 

Dūrādāvasathān ..dūre kāryam hitaisinā'. This is Apuśāsana 104.82 (Manu IV. 151). The verge Acārāllabhate hyāyur-ācāro hantyalaksanam' ( Anu. 104. 155 ) occurs in Manu IV. 156. It is possible that the final redactor of the Mahabhārata had before him a Smrti ascribed to Yama or it is likely that a few verses ascribed to Yama were first cited and the author of the Epic added a few more from other sources. Yams is pro fusely quoted in the various Kāndas of Kalpataru. 

The Smṛticandrikā quotes a verse of Yama which speaks of the Sun being in the zodiacal sign Virgo.638 

Yama required the king to look into the disputes of liti gants carefully and impartially.834 Yama cites the authority of Manu for the proposition that everything brought about by coercion such as a gift or a deed was liable to be set aside.685 This is almost identical with Manu 8. 168. Yama lays down that a Brāhmana was never to be awarded corporal punish ment, but that a Brāhmana guilty of crimes was to be impri soned and made638 to work. Yama like Yaj. (II. 145 ), pre scribed that the stridhana of a woman married in the Asura

form went to her father637 if she dierl childless. Aparārka (p. 822 ) quotes two verses of Yama that prescribed the first ammercement for him who, though forbidden, wrongfully takes the water of a lake or disturbs a water-courge and the highest ommercement for him who breaks a lake. Aparārka (p. 860 ) also cites Yama for the fine of five krsnalas in the case of adultery with another's wife of the same caste as that of the paramour and twelve panjas in case the wife is of a lower caste. The Smrticandrika and the Vyavaharamayūkba on the other hand direct that the king should punish the Brāhmana woman guilty of adultery with a Sūdra by throwing her to dogs and by forcible tonsure and riding on an ass in case of adultery with a Kiatriya or Vaibya. The Smrticandrikā, Parāsara-Mādhaviya and Vyavahāramayukha quote a verse of Yome about a debtor, who, being able to pay, does not want only pay, being punished by taking twice the amount. Yama remarks that the order of Saṁnyāsa is not allowed to women in the Vedas or in the sāstra 38 (dharmadāstra ) and that her real dharma is to be the mother of children from one of her own caste. 

Verses of Bșhadyama are cited 098 by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 255, 260, 289 and by Aparārka, who, on p. 496, quotes also from Laghuyama a verse and a half. 

Yama is cited 46 times in the Kalpataru (Brahmacāri Kānda ) and 13 times in the Moksakānda (in which it quotes 70 verses ). Iu Brahmacārio (pp. 23-24 ) it cites two verses of Yama in wbich the names of twenty Dharmaśāstrakāras are given including the name of Yama himself and it is added that they are extremely authoritative and should not be nullified
