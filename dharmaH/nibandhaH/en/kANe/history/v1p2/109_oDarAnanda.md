109. Todarānanda 

Rājā Țodaramalla, the celebrated finance minister of Akbar, compiled an extensive encyclopædia of civil and religious law, astronomy and medicine. I gave in the first edition some in formation about this work gathered from several sources. No part of the work had been printed when the first edition of the first volume was published in 1930. In 1945 Pandit K. Madhav Krishna Sarma contributed a paper on Todarānanda to the Journal of the G. J. R. I. of Allahabad, vol. III. pp. 63-66. There he stated that the Anup Sanskrit Library at Bikaner has the most complete set of the parts of the Țodarānanda. In 1948 Dr. P. L. Vaidya published a volume containing two parts of the text of the encyclopaedic work viz. on Sarga (creation of the

world) and Avatāras, in the Gangā Oriental Series of Bikaner with a Foreword by Sardar K. M. Panikkara (the then Prime Minister of the Bikaner State ), with a learned Introduction (by Dr. Vaidya), Text (in 386 pages) and some Appendices (Appendix A, giving a brief sketch of the life of Raja Todar mal, B containing a few stanzas glorifying Todarmal found in Manirāma's Padyasangraha and three verses from the Benares Draupadi-Kunda Inscription of Sarivat 1616 (i, e. 1589 A, D.) inscribed by order of Todarmal, Appendix C (pp. 395-414) supplying information on several sections of the Todarānanda derived from mss. in different libraries. 

Dr. Vaidya (in his Introduction pp. XVII-XXXI ) brings to gether valuable information about Todarmal and his work 

After a few Introductory verses containing obeisance to Brahman, Krśṇa, Ganesa and Manu (in six verses ), a few verses (I. 7-18) deal with the family and ancestors of Todarmal. Todarmal came of a Ksatriya family of Oudh called Țandana. The first ancestor named is Bala (1. 7) who was a devotee of Krsna. His son was Attali – son Dāma ( Damodara ) - Son Assū (a warrior and devotee of Krsna ) - his son Dvārakādasa, patron of learned men-son Dvijamalla - son Bhagavatīdāsa - son Todara malla born at Laharpur in Oudh. The family was in straightened circumstances owing to Bhagavatidāsa's large charities which the Pandit ( who composed the Intro. verses ) says uprooted poverty for a long time ( Intro, v. 13). He had to accept service under Akbar as a clerk. Akbar soon found out Todarmal's great talents and sent him to Gujarat ( wiich had recently been con quered by him) as a gifted revenue settlement officer and also a warrior. Later, Akbar sent him to Bihar and Bengal for the same purpose. Akbar made him a commander, Wuzir and Diwan in 1582 A. D.). Todarmal was not only endowed with high qua lities but was also highly interested in learning and spent much of his wealth in charities, in building or renovating temples, consecrating iniages of Kṭsna and constructing large tanks and wells. He is said to have rebuilt the temple of Viśveśvara at the instance of Nārāyapabhatta about 1585 A. D. This temple was later demolished in 1669 A. D. by Aurangzeb, The Todara nanda is divided into 22 sections called Saukhyas and each Saukhya has sub-sections called harsas.

The question is whether Todarral is the author of the work called Todarānanda, that he was the inspirer, there can be no doubt. Verse 19 (of Introduction) states that he called together learned Pandits of pure character, honoured them and instructed them to compile this work which would be the quintessence of the several Purāṇas and Snistis.1268 Dr. P. L. Vaidya says that the ļodarānananda must have been composed between 1572 A. D. ( which is the year mentioned in Jyotisaukhya p. Xxx of Intro.) and 1589 A. D. (the year in which Todarmal died). We have also to remember that the extent of the Encyclopaedia ( as Dr. Vaidya says on p. 414 ) cannot be fixed with certainty, since the Rājaniti and Karmavipāka sections have not yet been traced and the Śrāddhasaukhya Ms. has no beginning nor end. He further says that we can roughly ascertain the extent of the remaining sections which put together comes to be of 72150 Slokas (each śloka of 32 syllables ). He further conjectures that the extent of the entire Todarānanda may be in the neighbourhood of 80000 

Slokas, 

The several parts of that encyclopædia dealing with ācāra, dāna, vyavahāra, śrāddha, viveka, prāyścitta, samaya were called saukhyas. An account of some of the saukhyas that were avail able to me may be concisely given here. The Vyavahārasau khya ( D. C. ms. No. 366 of 1875-76 ) begins with an invocation of Śiva, speaks of the pārasika emperor?369 (Akbar) of Hind (India) and then deals with the several topics of judicial pro cedure such as the king's duty to look into disputes, the sabhā, judge, meaning of the word vyavahāra, enumeration of 18 vyarahārapadas, time and place of rjavahara, the plaint, the reply, the agent of the parties (pratinidhi), pratyakalita, the superiority of one mode of proof over another, witnesses, documents, possession, inference, ordeals and oaths, grades of punish

ments and fines. The Vyavahārasaukhya does not dwell on the exposition of the several titles of law. Besides the smsti writers, it principally relies on the Kalpataru, the Parijata, Bhava deva, the Mitaksara, the Ratnakara, Harihara, and Halayudha. The several sections are styled harṣas. 

____ The Vivahasaukhya ( D. C. Ms. No. 916 of 1886-92 in folios 54 ) is chiefly concerned with the astrological aspects of marriage viz. the proper year, month, day, zodiacal sign, naksa. tra for marriage, good characteristics of a marriageable girl and bridegroom; proper age for marriage for a girl and a male; many authors and works are quoted (most of which are men tioned below).1370 

The Sraddhasaukhya (D. C. ms. No. 257 of 1884-87) is an extensive work and deals with the usual topics such as the differ ent kinds of sraddhas, the time and place for sraddha, the proper brahmanas, sapindikarana &c. The sections of this work also are divided into harṣas. Besides those enumerated above the authors and works mentioned are noted below.1371 

The Jyotiḥsaukhya (D. C. ms. No. 915 of 1886-92) consti tutes the Samhitā branch of Indian astronomy and deals with

such topics as the results of eclipses, the appearance of comets, the rise of Agastya, Ursa major, the signs of the Zodiac &c. It frequently refers to Kāsyapa, Garga (or Vṛddhagarga ), Parāsara, Mayūracitra, Varāha. The colophons state that Țodara malla was a scion of the Țandala (or - na) family and that the work was compiled by Nilakantha at the order of Todaramalla.1373 This Nilakantha appears to be the author of the Sanjñātantra on which a commentary was written by his son Govinda in 1622 A. D., in which it is stated that Nilakantha was honoured by Akbar and had composed the Todarānanda.1373 In the Tājika-Nila kanthi of Nilakntha it is stated that the author composed works on the three branches of Jyotisa which gave delight to Țodara. 1374 

The Jyotiḥsaukhya was composed in śake 14941375 ( i. e. 1572 A. D.). The ms. of the Vyavahārasaukhya bears at the end the date saṁvat 1638 ( 1581-821378 A D.) which seems to be the date of its composition. Todaramalla was a man of versatile genius. He distinguished himself as an able commander as well as a great financier and statesman. The Țodarānanda gives some information about the family of Todarmal and his ancestors (as briefly set out above). Besides, Blochman's English translation of the Ain-i-Akbari ( Vol. I. pp. 351–52) gives some informa tion. On p. 352 we are told that his son Dharu i. e. Govar dhanadhari) was a commander of 700 horse and was killed in a campaign in Sindh. Beveridge's Akbarnama (Index Vol. p. 62 ) refers to two sons of Todarmal viz. Dhari (i. e. Govardhana dhāri) and Kalyāṇa. Other useful works are; Vincent Smith's biography of Akbar in the series called "Rulers of India"; and Dr. A. S. Altekar's History of Benares (pp. 39-43). Todarmal was born at Laharpur in Oudh and not at Lahore as is often

stated ( vide Blochman's translation p. 620 ) and he died on 10th November 1589 A. D. 

Dr. Vaidya’s edition of the first two parts ( on p. 6 verses 24–27) enumerates the twentytwo parts (called Saukhyas) in which the subjects were distributed ( vide not below).1377 

Several parts of this huge work are described as viracita (composed) by Todarmalla e. g. the printed text of Dr. Vaidya's edition of the first two Saukhyas ( vide note below). Dr. Vaidya (in Intro. P. XXVI ) argues that these words are not to be taken literally, that all that is meant is that Todaramalla conceived the project and provided for all the expenses incurred in engag. ing learned Pandits for collecting the material, for arranging it under proper heads and making copies of the several parts of it. I agree with him in this matter. But Dr. Vaidya goes further and argues ( Introduction pp. XXVII-VIII ) that considering all the facts he would ascribe the authorship of the Todarānanda to Nārāyaṇabhatta chiefly (P. XXVIII of Intro.). I demur to this conclusion. In verse 19 of the Introduction quoted above, it is expressly stated that Todarmal invited learned men of pure character and directed them to compose the work. There was nothing to prevent him from saying that he called 'Bhatta Nārāyaṇa' among the Pandits to preside over the task of pre paring a huge work on Dharmaśāstra. 

Dr. Vaidya agrees (p. xxx of Introduction) that the work was undertaken and finished between 1572 to 1589 A. D., the the year in which Todarmal died. 

To me it appears probable that Nārāyaṇabhatta refused to undertake such a heavy task because he had become old (in

1572 he would have been about 59 years old ). There is ano ther important circumstance indicating that Nārāyaṇabhatta must not have anything to do with this encyclopaedia, since we know for certain that the Jyotiḥsaukhya, (a part of the Todarānanda ) was composed by Nilakantha, son of Ananta (vide p. 398 of Dr. Vaidya's edition ). If the name of one Pandit Nilakantha is expressly mentioned as regards the Samhitāsaukhya, no acceptable reason can be advanced as to why Nārāyaṇabhatta's name is not mentioned anywhere, if he had been responsible for the other parts of the encyclopaedia or for the whole work. 

It may be noted that the Todarānanda came to be mentioned as an authoritative work at least from about 1610 A. D. For example, the Nirnayasindhu (of Kamalakarabhatta ) cites it and so does the Vyavahāramayukha of Nilakantha, paternal cousin of Kamalakara ( vide note below). 1978 

The Vivāhasaukhya refers to the Rājanstisaukhya, to the Ganitasaukhya, Samskārasaukhya, Horāsukha (these last three said to be already composed ). 1379

ted that beautiful reservoir in 1646 of the Vikrama era 1380 (i.e. 1589 A. D.). Therefore it follows that literary works were com piled under the patronage of Todarmal between 1570-586 A. D. 

It is not possible for reasons of space to deal with all or most of the Saukhyas of Țodarānanda but it would be inte resting for scholars to know something more of one or more of the other Saukhyas like the Vivāhasaukkya of this large Saukhya called Todarānanda. 

He begins by saying that the person who has completed his studies (snātaka ) and bas returned from the Gurukula is required by the Smstis e. g. Manu III. 2, VI. 34 to become a householder. Therefore our sāstras require every young man to be married and in order that he should get married he has to look into the Astrological matters which are omitted here, Manu and others praise Vivaha very much which is unnecessary to set out here. Manu recommends (chap. IX) a girl that has attained puberty to be married by her parents and guardians to a worthy bride-groom and that if such a bride-groom is not secured she might remain unmarried for her life. While arranging for the matter parents or guardians require that an astrologically proper conjunction of heavenly bodies is secured. According to Samskāra-saukhya based on Parāśara and other writers the girl should be married between 8 to 10 years. One writer called Sridhara in his work called Vivahapatala quotes that the marriage may be performed at all times. Many authors and works have been quoted in this Vivāhasaukhya No. 916 of 1886 92 at B.O.R.I. Dozens of Smstis and authors are quoted as also astrological and astronomical works. But it is not possible to enter into greater details here for want of space. 

It refers to the Ganitasaukhya on fol. 26 a. He also refers to Horasaukhya on folio 46b, Rājaniti-Saukhya on folio 53 b. 

This ms. is well written and the present author feels that an edition of it can be easily brought out on one ms. alone,
