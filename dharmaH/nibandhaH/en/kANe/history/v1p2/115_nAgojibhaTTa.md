115. Nāgojibbaṭṭa 

The learning of Nāgojibhatta was of an encyclopaedic character. Though his special forte was Vyakaraṇa ( grammar) he wrote standard works also on poetics, dharmaśāstra, yoga and other sāstras. The number of works ascribed to him is very large. Aufrecht in his Cat. Catalogorum, part I pp. 283 284 mentions 47 works as composed by him. Dr. P. K. Gode in volume III of his Studies in Indian Literary History' pp. 214–219 deals at some length with the works of Nāgoji on Vyakarana (Grammar ), Poetics and Dharmaśāstra (in its

several branches ). On dharmaśāstra he composed several works, viz. Ācārendusekhara, Aśaucanirṇaya, Tithindusekhara, Tirthendusekhara, Prayascittendusekhara or Prayascittasāra samgraha, Sraddhendusekhara, Sapiṇdimañjari and Sapindya dipikā or Sāpindyanirṇaya. Of his far-famed works on the Papinian system, such as the Mahābhāṣya-pradipoddyota, the Paribhāṣendusekhara, the Vaiyakarañasiddhantamañjūṣā, (in large and small recensions ), the Sabdendusekhara (big and small) and of his commentaries on the Kavyaprakāśa-pradipa, the Kuvalayānanda, the Rasagangadhara, the Rasatarangini, the Rasamañjari, nothing can be said here for want of space. 

For his Prāyaścittendusekhara, vide Mitra's Notices vol. V, p. 23 No. 1735, where detailed contents are given ; for the Śrāddhendusekhara, Ulwar cat. extract No. 360 p. 139, for the Tirthendusekhara, Ulwar cat. p. 120, extract No. 312. 

Some of Nāgojibhatta's (or Nagesabhatta's ) works on Dharmaśāstra may be mentioned here. He composed the Titbinirṇayatattva containing 101 stanzas (in writing which he relied upon the conclusions of the Nirṇayasindhu ).1500 The names of his works on Dharmaśāstra are mentioned in the note below.1501 Nāgoji's surname was Kāla (i. e. Kale in these days ) but in some Mss, it is given as Upadhyāya (vide note below ).1502

He composed works on Kavyaśāstra, such as the Kāvya pradipoddyota, the Rasagangadhara-marmaprakāśa ( Nir. ed.), and very learned works on Vyakarana ( grammar) such as the Paribhāṣendusekhara (vide Dr. P. K. Gode’s ‘Relative chrono logy of Nāgoji's works“ in bis “Studies in Literary History' vol. III pp. 212-219). 

Nāgojibhatta was the son of Śivabhatta and Sati and was a Mahārāṣtra Brāhmaṇa surnamed Kala (Kale). At the beginning and end of several works of his (such as Rasagangadhara-marmaprakāśa, the Maõjūsā ) he tells us that he was patronised by Rāma of the Bisena family,1503 the ruler of a city named śrāgavera (which seems to be on the Ganges above Allahabad ). He was the pupil of Hari dikṣita,1504 son of Vireśvara and pupil of Rāmāśrama and grandson of the great grammarian Bhattoji-dikșita.150s Tradition says that he composed the grammatical work Sabdaratna and ascribed it to his teacher Haridiksita in gratitude. In the 1508 commentary on the Praudhamanoranā Haridikșita refers to the Sabdaratna as his own work and to the Sabdendusekhara as that of his pupil. 

Bhattojidikșita was a pupil of the Mimāṁsaka Śhaṅkara bhatta and of Śesa Srikrsna and almost a contemporary of Jagannāthapandita. Bhattoji's pupil Nilakantha śukla wrote a work in saṁvat 1663 ( Dr. Belvalkar in Systems of Sanskrit Grammar, p. 47). Therefore he flourished in the first half of the 17th century. For the date of Bhattoji, vide J. 0. I. (Baroda ) vol. IV pp. 33-36 and J. of Venkatesvara 0. I. vol. I part 2 pp. 117-127. In Kane Festschrift Dr. Gode places Varadaraja, a pupil of Bhattoji, between 1600–1650 A. D.

(pp. 188-199) and so Bhattoji, who was a pupil of Śhaṅkara bhatta, may be assigned to the period between 1575–1645 A. D. Nāgojibhatta was a pupil of Bhattoji's grandson. There fore Nāgojibhatta must have flourished towards the end of the 17th century and the first half of the 18th century. Nāgoji bhatta's literary activities, looking to his vast out-put, must have extended over a long period of more than 50 years. The pedigree1507 from Bhattojidikṣita, through a succession of teacher and pupils or father and son, is given below. Vide introduction to the Rasagangadhara (Nirn, ed.); Trivedi's introduction pp. 18-20 to the Vaiyakaranabhūṣana of Konda bhatta, a nephew of Bhattoji (B. S. series ); Dr. Belvalkar's Systems of Sanskrit grammar pp. 46-50 and Kielhorn's preface to the Paribhāṣendusekhara p. XXV ( where the succession of teacher and pupil is brought down to the days of Kielhorn himself) for further details. In the Indian Antiquary, vol. 41

p. 247, Mr. S. P. V. Ranganatha Syami makes Bhattoji a pupil of Śesa Vireśvara and not of Beṣa Kṭṣpa. But the passage of the Manoramākucamardana, if properly interpreted, makes it clear that Bhattoji was the pupil of Sesa Kșspa and not of Vireśvara.1508 A ms. of Nāgojibhatta's commentary on the Rasamañjarī is dated samvat 1769, Māgha 7th bright half, Wednes day, i. e. 21st January 1713 A. D. ( vide 1. O. cat. vol. III p. 365). It is not unlikely that Nāgojibhatta first composed his commen taries on the comparatively easy śāstra of poetics and that he then worked upon Dharnasāstra and Vyakarapa. The edition of the Rasagangadhara in the Kavyamalā series says that there is a tradition that Nāgoji was invited by king Savai Jaising of Jaipur to a horse-sacrifice in 1714 A. D., but that Nāgoji declined on the ground of Kṣetra-sainnyūsa. That Savai Jaising of Amber performed the Aśvamedha sacrifice was scouted by Prof. D. C. Sarakar, but long and forceful arguments have been advanced against this theory by Dr. P. K. Gode ( in his studies in literary history ', vol. III pp. 166-180) and in J. I. H. (Madras) vol. 15 pp. 364-367; vide also Poona Orientalist', vol. II pp. 166-178 for Savai Jaising. Therefore his literary activity must be placed between 1700 and 1750 A. D. Mahāmahopadhyāya Haraprasada Śāstri says (Ind. Ant. vol. 41 p. 12) that Nāgoji died about 1775. But this appears rather improbable. If one of his works was copied in 1713 A. D. he could hardly have lived up to 1775, unless he was about 100 years old at that time.

If 4754 means 'pupil' here as Mr. Ranganath Svami contends (Ind. Ant. vol, 41 p. 251), why should the dual be necessary or be used and not the singular or plural ? The frutat is a com. on the प्रक्रियाकौमुदी of रामचन्द्राचार्य. Vide Journal of Oriental Research vol. III, part 2, p. 146 where it is said that Jagannatha was a pupil of वीरेश्वर, son of शेषकृष्ण, who lived under the patronage of Giridhārī, son of ļolarmnal and that Bhattoji was pupil of शेषकृष्ण and later of अप्पयदीक्षित.
