  <p>SYNOPSIS OF CONTENTS</p>
<p>( PART I)</p>
<p>Sec. 1 Meaning of Dharma :</p>
<p>.. pp. 1-6</p>
<p>Defies exact rendering in English - In the Rgveda, used as ad jective or noun - means &rsquo; upholder or supporter&rsquo;in some Ṛgvedic passages - in most Rgveda passages means &lsquo;religious ordinances or rites&rsquo; and in rare cases · fixed principles or rules of conduct &rsquo; . in Aitareya-brahmana dharma means “whole body of religious duties&rsquo;. in Chandogva-Upaniṣad dharma means &lsquo;peruliar duties of aśramas-&rsquo; dharma came to mean&rsquo; duties and privileges of a person as a mem ber of the Aryan community, as member of one of the varṇas or as in a particular stage of life - the same meaning in Taittiriya Upaniṣad (1. 11), Bhagavadgita, Manusmṛti and other smṛtis - according to Medbātithi, dharma five-fold viz., varṇadharma, āśra madharma, varnāsramadharma, naimittikadharma, gunadharma - this meaning of dharma taken in this work - definitions of dharma according to Jaimini, Vaisesikasūtra, Hārita, Mahābhārata and Buddhist works - subjects treated in this work, viz. sources of dharma, contents of works on dharma, their chronology.</p>
<p>Sec. 2 Sources of Pharma :</p>
<p>.. pp. 6-11</p>
<p>ATII</p>
<p>According to Gautama, Apastamba, Vasiṣtha, Manu, Yājña valkya - principal sources were Veda, smrtis and custom - Vedas do not contain positive precepts on dharma, but give information incidentally-examples from Vedic literature suggesting dharmasa stra rules - division of ancient Sanskrit works into three groups, viz. the Vedic Sajjhitās, the Brahmanas and Sātras - Kalpa is one of the six angas of the Veda - Kalpa di ting&rsquo;!ished by Tantravārtika from Kalpasutras.comprehensive pill thing of Kalpa - Kalpasūtras classi fied into three classes, viz. ? lutistras, Grhyasūras and Dharma sūtras - brief review of Dr. Ram Gopal&rsquo;s large work on &lsquo;India of Vedic Kalp:sutras - mainly uzals !1 Gșh;a and Dharmasūtras, that too, not critically or thoroughly.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>. - A</li>
</ol>
<p>Sec. 3 When Dharmaśāsira works were first composed .. pp.12–19</p>
<p>It is difficult to say when composed - Nirkta (III. 4-5) exhi bits controversies about inheritance and quotes a verse (sloka) from some work on dharma - Būhler&rsquo;s view about such verses - Gau tama and Baudhāyana speak of dharmaśāstra - Baudhāyana and Apastamba mention numerous sages on dharmia - Vārtika of Katya yana and Jaimini speak of dharmaśāstra - Patañjali on dharmaṣi trakāras- dharmaśāstra works existed prior to Yaska or at least before 600 B.C. and in 2nd century B. C. dharmasūtras had become authoritative-method of dealing with the whole dharmasastra litera ture followed in this book, first dharmasūtras, then early metrical smstis like those of Manu ard Yājñavalkya, later versified smstis, then commentaries and digests, such as the Mitāksarā - chronology of early writers very difficult to settle - Max Mūller&rsquo;s view that works in continuous śloka metre followed sūtra works not acceptable.</p>
<p>Sec. 4 Dharmasūtras :</p>
<p>.. pp. 19-22 Many of them formed part of the Kalpa and were studied in distinct sūtra-caranas - dharmasūtras of Āpastamba and Baudhā yana presuppose grhyasūtras of thier carana - no dharmasūtras ex tant corresponding to the śrauta and gshya sutras of Asvalāyana, Saṅkhāyana and Mānava-Tantravārtika on what dharmasūtra was studied in what particular Vedic Sakhā-all dharmasūtras gradually became authoritative in all schools - close connection between grhyasūtras and dharmasutras on certain topics - scope of dharma sūtras - gìhyasotras sometimes refer to dharmasūtras - points of distinction between dharmasūtras and the other smstis.</p>
<p>Sec. 5 Dharmasutra of Gautama:</p>
<p>.. pp. 22-38</p>
<p>Gautama&rsquo;s is the oldest extant dharmasūtra - specially studied by followers of Sāmaveda - Gautama one of the nine subdivisions of the Ranayaniya school of Sāmaveda - Gautamadbarmasūtra points to close connection with Samaveda - Gautarria refers to his own previous dicta-contents of 28 chapters of Gautamadharmasūtra - the work is entirely in prose - Gautama&rsquo;s language agrecs more with Pānini&rsquo;s rules than Apastamba&rsquo;s -explanation of this - Haradatta prefers Pāṇinian readings of Gautama&rsquo;s text - some stras ofSynopsis of Contents</p>
<p>Gautama quoted in the Mitākṣarā and other works not found in extant text - extent of literature known to Gautama - the only author named is Manu- the meaning of &lsquo;ācāryāḥ&rsquo; whose views are cited by Gautama - earliest reference to Gautama on dharma is in</p>
<p>Baudhāyana-dharmasūtra - Baudhāyana (III. 10 ) borrows chap. 19 of Gautama-close correspondence between many other sūtras of Gautama and Baudhāyana - Vasistha ( 4.35 and 37 ) refers to views of Gautama - Vasistha&rsquo;s 22nd chap. is borrowed from 19th of Gautama - many sūtras the same in Gautama and Vasistha - Gau tama referred to by Manu as son of Utathya - Gautama referred to by Yajñavalkya, Bhaviṣyapurāṇa, Kumātila, Saskarācārya, Medha tithi - Gautama&rsquo;s reference to Yavana - probable age between 100 400 B.C. - Haradatta and Maskarin commented on Gautama-Asa haya also did so - special matters presented by Gaut. Dh. S.-śloka Gautama and Vṛddha-Gautama.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>TI</p>
<p>Sec. 6 Baudhayana-dharmasutra :</p>
<p>.. pp. 38-53 Baudhāyana is a teacher of the Black Yajurveda-arrangement of Baudhayana kalpa according to Dr. Burnell and Dr. Caland - Baudhāyanagrhya presupposes the Baudhāyanadharmasūtra - gshya (I11.9.6) speaks of pravacan:kāra Kanva Bodhāyana and sūtrakāra A pastamba - tarpana in Baudhayana dharmasutra (II. 5. 27 ) men tions Kanva Bodhāyana, Apastamba and Hiranyakesin - contents of Baudhāyanadharmasūtra - extant sūtra has not come down in tact-fourth praśna probably an interpolation - third praśna also not free from doubt - Baudhāyana III.10 taken from Gautama. Baudhā yana III. 6 agrees closely with Viṣṇudharmasutra 48 - Dr. Jolly thinks both borrowed from a conimon source - probably Viṣṇu borrows from Baudhāyana - repetitions exist even in the first two praśnas - form and structure of Baudhāyana - quotes numerous verses, even in the first two praśnas - language of Baudhāyana often departs from Paninian standard - literature known to Baudhayana - several authors on dharma together with their views mentioned by Baudhāyana - Asura Kapila said to be originator of asramas-Sabara, Kumārila, Viśvarūpa and Medhātithi refer to Baudhāyana dharma sūtra - home of Baudhāyana - Baudhāyana is styled pravacanakāra and Apastamba sūtrakāra - Būhler holds that Baudhayana was a southern teacher - sets out five peculiar usages of southern part - buotes several views about Āryāvarta - age of Baudhāyana dharma</p>
<p>sūtra - later than Gautama - Būhler&rsquo;s reasons for placing Baudha yana a century or two earlier than Apastamba not convincing-diver gences between Baudhāyana and Apastamba - style of Baudhā yana compared with that of Apastamba - Baudhāvana to be placed between 500-200 B. C.- numerous sūtras of Baudhayana identical with those of Apastamba and Vasiṣtha - Baudhavana mentions several appellations of Ganesa, just as Mānavagļhya does and mentions seven planets, Rāhu and Ketu- Govindasvamin commen ted on Baudhayana.</p>
<p>Sec. 7 Dharmasūtra of Ăpastamba:</p>
<p>.. pp. 53-90</p>
<p>The Ăpastambakalpasūtra of the Black Yajurveda divided in to 30 prasnas, dharmasūtra constituting 28th and 29th prasnas thereof - Ápastamba is one of the five subdivisions of the Khāndi keya school of Taittiriyaśākhā -Apastanibagļhya and dharma-sūtras are compositions of the same author-some sutras of the two are iden tical-Ap. gphya does not treat of some topics as they are dealt with in dharmasūtra - though Dr. Ram Gopal points out ten sutras in Ap. Gr. about the choice of a marriageable girl there is only one rule worth something - there are several passages where Ap. Dh. S. presupposes Āp. Gr.-contents of Ap.dharmasūtra-form and struc ture of Ap. dharmasūtra-Ap. is more archaic and un- Paninian th any other dharmasūtra-many unfamiliar words in Ap.-several verses quoted in Ap-literature known to Āp.- Ap. mentions six angas of Veda and ten writers on dharma by name-Svetaketu and Ap.-Hārita quoted frequently by Ap. - Ap. controverts several veiws-striking coincidences between Gautama and Ap. - Āp. quotes a verse from Purāṇa and speaks of the view of Bhaviṣyatpurāṇa - Apastamba and Manu - Apastamba presupposes many rules of the Mimāṁsā and agrees closely with Jaimini&rsquo;s sūtras-age of Ap. Dh. S. - quoted by Sabara, Kumārila, Saskarācārya, Viśvarūpa and Medhātithj - home and personal history of Apastamba not known - Dr. Ram Gopal&rsquo;s view about Ápastamba being earlier than Pāụini who gives Apastamba&rsquo;s name in Bidādiga na, refuted - reply to Dr. Ram Gopal&rsquo;s puerile arg&rsquo;iments about the home of Apastamba etc.-Áp. is later than Gautama and probably Baudhayana - Ap. Dh. S. may be assigned to the period of 450-350 B. C, not 600-300 B. C. ( as in the first edition)- Áp. condemns niyoga, rejects secondary sons, does not admit paiśāca and Prājupatya forms of marriage - divergence</p>
<p>Synopsis of Contents</p>
<p>between the views of Ap. and Gautama and other sūtrakāras - Haradatta&rsquo;s is the only commentary extant on Ap.- Apastamba smrti in verse.</p>
<p>Sec. 8 Hiranyakesidharmasutra :</p>
<p>.. 91-94</p>
<p>Hiranyakesidharmasūtra forms 26th and 27th praśnas of the Hiranyakeśikalpa - Hiraṇyakesin&rsquo;s can be hardly called an indepen dent work, as it borrows hundreds of sūtras word for word from</p>
<p>Ap.- a few additions made to Ap. in Hiranyakesi Dh.S. - Hiranya kesin&rsquo;s readings are smoother and more classical than Āpastamba&rsquo;s - arrangement of sūtras also is somewhat different in the two -com. of Mahadeva called Ujjvalā on Hyraṇyakeśin is almost the same as Haradatta&rsquo;s on Āp. - Būhler thinks Mahadeva borrows from Haradatta - Mahadeva&rsquo;s com. in a few places contains more matter than Haradatta&rsquo;s and Mahadeva differs from Haradatta.</p>
<p>FU</p>
<p>Sec. 9 Vasistha-dharmasutra :</p>
<p>.. pp. 94-112 Different editions of Vasistha contain different numbers of chapters - Kumārila says it was specially studied by Rgvedins - ex planation of this statement - nothing special in the Vasisthadharma sūtra to connect it with Rgveda - contents of the Vasiṣthadharma sūtra - style of Vas. Dh. S. resembles Gautama&rsquo;s - many sūtras of Vas, identical with Gautama and Baudhāyana - form of Vasistha dharmasūtra resembles Baudhāyaradharmasūtra - Medhātithi and Mitakṣarā quote from almost all chapters of extant Vasistha and so does Viśvarūpa - literature known to Vasiṣtha-Vasiṣtha prohibits learning language of Mlecchas - authors on dharmaśātsra named by Vasiṣtha - Vasistha&rsquo;s references to the views of Manu are made with reference to a work of Manu almost identical with the present Manu smṛti and do not compel us to forniluate the existence of a Māna vadharmasutra - Būhler wrong in taking Vas. Dh. S. 4.8 as a quo tation from Mānavadharmasūtra-only Vas. Dh. S. 12.16 and 19.37 where Manu is quoted have no corresponding verses in the present Manusmrti - over forty verses are entirely common to Vas. and present Manusmīti - conclusion that Vas. contains borrowings from the present Manusmṛti or its prototype in verse - Vas. Dh. S. 22 is the same as Gautama 19 - Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s view that Vas. Dh. S. 28. 10-15 and 18-22 are borrowed from Viṣṇudharmasūtra chap. 56 and 87 or its original the Kathakadharmasutra is wrong - home of Vas, to</p>
<p>the north of Narmadā, according to Būhler - this is mere specula tion - earliest reference to Vasiṣtha as a writer on dharma is in Manu (8.140 ) - age of Vasiṣtha - Vasiṣtha&rsquo;s views are ancient, praticularly about secondary sons, about Dattaka son, about niyoga and remarriage - he mentions only six forms of marriage - but in other matters differs from Gaut. or Baudh. viz, on adoption, on documents - Vas. Dh. S. between 303–100 B. C.- whether Vas. 18.4 ( Rāmaka v. 1. Romaka ) contains a reference to the Romans - the author of the extant Vas. Dh. S. appears to be eclectic and the extant Vas. Dh. S. is only a re-hash of the Ap. Dh. S., Baud. Dh. S. and Manu - passages from the Samhitas and Brahmanas quoted in or referred to by Vas. Dlı. S. outnumber the Rgvedic passages - this shows that Vas. Dh. S. did not at first attach itself to the Rgveda - Dr. Ram Gopal&rsquo;s remarks on the passages of Vas, and the three Gṭ. sūtras attached to Rgveda are misleading - Viddha-Vasi ștha, an early compilation - there is a Bṛhad Vasiṣtha and a Jyotir Vasistha - Yajñasvāmin commented upon Vas. Dh. S.</p>
<p>Sec. 10 Viṣṇudharmasutra :</p>
<p>&hellip; 112-127</p>
<p>Viṣṇu Dh. S. contains 100 chapters and yet sutra not extensive - several chap. (40, 42, 76 ) contain only one sutra and one verse - first chap. and the last two are entirely in verse, the rest in mixed prose and verse - Viṣṇu Dh. S. closely connectej with Kathasākha - Dr. Jolly says chap. 21, 67, 73 and 86 of Vișnu closely correspond with Kathaka gshya - but Viṣṇu Dh. S. is not the work of the author of Kathaka grhya - contents of Viṣṇu Dh. S. - Viṣṇu resembles Vas. Dh. S. - its peculiar feature that it professes to be re vealed by God Viṣṇu - its style, easy and diffuse - work contains old and new material - hundreds of sūtras are prose renderings of hund reds of verses occurring in our Manu - hypothesis of a common origin or borrowing by both from a floating mass of verses unten able - extant Viṣṇudharmasutra borrows from Manu-Vispu contains verses identical with the Bhagavadgitā and Yājñavalkya smrti - Dr. Jolly&rsquo;s view that Yājñavalkya borrows his anatomical section from Viṣṇu not correct - Vispu Dh. S. contains long list of tirthas, the word Jaiva for Jupiter - those wanting in Yājñavalkya - extant Viṣṇu Dh. S. later than Manusmṛti and Yajñavalkyasmsti - Viśva rūpa does not quote a single sutra of Viṣṇu by name, though he refers to Viṣṇu (ch. 97) for orders of samnyasins - Mitāksarā</p>
<p>Synopsis of Contents</p>
<p>quotes hardly any verse from Viṣṇu - Aparārka and Smsticandrika quote Viṣṇu profusely - verses were added at a late date to original sūtra - literature known to Viṣṇu Dh.S. -Viṣṇu mentions the seven days of the week, recommends the practice of saii, speaks of pus takas, of many good and evil omens among which the sight of yellow-robed Buddhist ascetics is included - it prohibits speech with Mlecchas and journeys to Mlcccha countries, it dilates on worship of Vasudeva - though Viṣṇu agrees in some respects with Kathaka grhya, on some points it differs from it- date of older kernel of Viṣṇu may be 300 to 10j B.C. - additions made after 3rd century A. D. and before 7th century - some sūtras agree closely with Nārada - Bșhad Viṣṇu and Vrddha Viṣṇu and Laghu Viṣṇu - Nanda pandita&rsquo;s com. on the Viṣṇu Dh.

<p>Sec. 11 The Dharmasūtra of Harita :</p>
<p>&hellip; pp. 127-136</p>
<p>Baudhāyana, Apastamba and Vasistha quote Hārīta as an authority - Mr. Islampurkar secured a ms. of Harītadharmasūtra at Nasik in 30 chapters - contents of that ms. - its relation to Maitra yaniyasashitā - it mentions the Kaśmirian word “Kaphella&quot; - two-fold classification of śruti and its explanation - quotations in commentaries and digests show that Harita dealt exhaustively with the same topics that are found in other dharmasūtras - Kumārila mentions Hārita as dharmaśāstrakāra but does not assign him to any particular caraña as he does Āpastamba and others - notable doctrines of Harita - mentions worship of Ganesa - Harita&rsquo;s verses on vyavahāra quoted in nibandhas are later than the sūtra - quoted by Aprārka, Kalpataru, Brahmacarikanda, Sm. C. - Laghu Hārita and Viddha Hārita - latter in verse is later than Yajñavalkya, Nārada and Katyayana.</p>
<p>Sec. 12 The Dharmasūtra of Sunkha-Likhita :</p>
<p>&hellip; pp. 136-142</p>
<p>From Tantravārtika it appears that dharmasūtra of Saṅkha Likhita was studied by Vājasaneyins - Mahabharata (Śānti 23 contains story of brothers Saṅkha and Likhita - Pali story in Dighanikāya seems to be based on the story in the Mahabharata - various compilations ascribed to Saṅkha alone or Likhita alone or to both - restoration of Dharmasūtra in the Annals of Bhandarkar</p>

<p>Sec. 13 Mānavadharmasūtra : Did it exist ?</p>
<p>&hellip; pp. 143-149</p>
<p>Max Mūller and Weber responsible for the theory that the extant Manusmṛti was a recast of an ancient Mānavadharmasūtra now lost - hardly any data for the sweeping generalisation of Max Mūller that all genuine dharmaśāstras are nothing but more modern texts of earlier sūtra works on kuladharma - one main plank of this theory that the continuous en ployment of the sloka metre was un known in the sutra period is now exploded - Būhler supports Max Mūller&rsquo;s theory by some additional arguments - Vasiṣtha IV. 5-8 on which Būhler relies not properly understood by him - Vasistha ( 19-37) quotes a Mānava sloka which is not in the Anuṣtubh metre and not found in extant Manu and Būhler thinks it is taken from Mānavadharmasūtra · Būhler&rsquo;s reliance on a fragment of Uśanas which is corrupt is not worth consideration - Būhler relies on Kamandakiyanitisāra ( II. 3 and XI. 67) where Mānavas are said to hold that there are three vidyās for a king and that Manu said that king&rsquo;s council should consist of 12 ministers - These views not the same in extant Manu - Būhler&rsquo;s conclusion not correct - Kamandaka is only paraphrasing Kautiliya-Būhler&rsquo;s generalisation about Mānava or Manavāh without foundation - Kumarila, Śhaṅkara and Viśvarūpa all employ · Mānava &lsquo;for Manusmṛti - Būhler relies on analogy of the complete set of Apastamba and Raudhayana sūtras for holding that a Mānavadharmasūtra existed - Proper explanation of Vas. Dh. S. IV. 5-8 - Būhler not right in saying that Vas. Dh. S. 11. 23, 12, 16, 23.43 either contradict Manu or find no counterpart therein - analogy of Apastamba sūtras of no use. excepting the three caranas of the Black Yajurveda, no carana of any Veda has a dharmasūtra attributed to the founder of that carapa - an explanation suggested - existing materials not sufficient to establish theory that a Mūnavadharmasūtra once existed.</p>

D. - relation of Mahābhārata and Manu - conflict of views between Mandlik, Hopkins and Būhler - Hopkins holds that there was a mass of floating verses ascribed to mythical Manu on which both Manusmrti and Mahabharata drew – Būhler says that the floating mass of verses was not all attributed to Manu - Manu mentions stories and names that occur in the Mahābhārata but these names go into Vedic antiquities - Manu never names the Mahābhārata, while the latter often refers to&rsquo;rājadharmas or śāstra of Manu&rsquo; or to what Manu said &rsquo; - Jayaswal&rsquo;s remarks on Manu XII. 100 are worthless for settling the date of the Manu smrti – both Hopkins and Būhler hold that the Anuśāsanaparva and Sāntiparva knew a Manusmrti, but earlier books, when ever they speak of Manu, refer to floating mass of popular verses - this conclusion not correct - final conclusion, viz., long before 4th</p>

<p>century B. C. there was a dharmaśāstra inverse attributed to Svā yambhuva Manu, there was another work on rājadharna attribu ted to Prācetasa Manu, that probably there was one work, then between 200 B. C, and 200 A. D. Manusmīti was recast - extant Mababhārata later than extant Manusmṛti-Vṛddha-Manu, if a sepa rate work, must have been composed before the 7th century A.D. influence of Manu spread to Cambodia and other countries beyond India - Manu had several commentators, Medbātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka, Nārāyana, Rāghavānanda, Nandana and Rāmacandra - Asahāya commented on Manu - Udayakara is another commenta tor and so is Dharanidhara - Nārāyaṇa flourished between 1100 1300 A.D.-Rāghavānanda later than 1400 A.D.-Vṛddha Manu and Bṛhan-Manu - explanation as to how these originated.</p>
<p>Sec. 32 The Two Epics</p>
<p>&hellip; pp. 349-408</p>
<p>The two great Epics contain numerous passages bearing on topics of Dharmasastra - Mbh. itself claims as being composed by Vyāsa as a great Dharmaśāstra, as Arthasāstra etc. - Mbh. consists of one hundred thousand verses – a great deal has been written about the Two Epics - a work for popular education long before the 7th cent. A. D. - Ånuvamsa Slokas in Mbh. - From the references in Papipi and Patañjali it is certain that the story of Mbh. is diffe rent from the story of Rāmāyaṇa - there was considerable scope for adding stories and didactic matter and hence the Mbh. became very much inflated by additions at different times - literature known to Mbh. - criticism against four passages relied upon by Hopkins as referring to Rāmāyaṇa – the core of the Mbh. existed before 500 B. C.-references to Mbh. in some early inscriptions - Nilakantha&rsquo;s commentary on Mbh. &ndash; date of the Mahābhārata war – both the Epics inspired many later writers to compose Sanskrit dramas on the characters and stories contained in them - the Mahābhārata, predominantly a Vaiṣžavite work.</p>
<p>Several recensions of the Rāmāyaṇa &ndash; the three well-known being Southern, Bengali and North-Western - relation to the Dasarathajātaka – references to the legends in the Mabābhārata occur in the extant Rāmāyaṇa - Rāmāyaṇa mainly being a Kāvya is less quoted than the Mahābhārata, but is relied upon as a source of dharma - the Rāmāyana exists in Bali in the Kavi language</p>

<p>&hellip; pp. 408-421 Yājñavalkya includes Purāṇa among the fourteen sources of Vidyās and of Dharma - Chāndogya Up, speaks of Itihasa-Purā na as the fifth Veda - originally there was a single work called Purāṇa eighteen Purāṇas - number of upapurāṇas varies - chronology of Purāṇas, a perplexing problem - main characteristics of the teach ings of the extant Purāṇas - Bhakti an important aspect dealt with by some Puranas - Mit. on Yāj. quotes several Purāṇas such as Brahmānda, Matsya, Bhaviṣyat, Skanda etc. - difference of opinion among the Purāṇas about the names and extent of the several Purāṇas - Matsyapurāṇa gives the extent of 18 Purāṇas as four lakhs of verses – Padmapurana divides the 18 Purāṇas into three groups viz. sāttvika, rājasa and tūmasa - a table showing which darmaśāstra topics are dealt with in which purā ṇa.</p>

D. - total number of verses on vyavahāra in the Agnipurāṇa is 315, out of which the first 31 are not taken from Yājñavalkya - almost all of these 31 taken from Nārada - Garuḍapurāṇa (chap. 93) expressly says that the dharma</p>

D. and little evidence to show that the text of Yājsavalkya as we have it contains several strata - comparison of Yajñavalkyasmrti with Manusmṛti – close agreement in phraseology between the two - Yājñavalkya usually tries to compress Manu&rsquo;s dicta - Yaj. adds Vinayakaśānti and Grahaśānti and ordeals, while Manu omits first two and cursorily refers to two ordeals - Yāj. silent on origin of world which we have in Manu - style of Yajñavalkya - contents of smsti - literature known to Yajñavalkyasmrti - enumerates 19 authors on dharma - Yoga-Yajñavalkya - contents of its twelve chapters some recommendations of Yoga-Yajñavalkya – it is a small work on Yoga and has little to do with Dharmaśāstra - close agreement between Viṣṇu Dh.

C. and 300 A. D. - Lankāvatārasūtra (gāthās 814–816) refers to Yajñavalkyasmṛti - Dr. Jolly thinks that Yāj. shows acqu aintance with Greek astrology - Dr. Jacobi&rsquo;s theory that naming of week-days after planets first introduced by Greeks and borrowed by Indians - these theories untenable - Yāj. does not mention week days, but only the nine planets (in I. 296) - Yāj. does not mention the zodiacal signs - he arranges the nakṣatras from Kșttika to Bharaṇī (I. 268 ) as the Taittiriyabrāhmaṇa does - susthe indau&rsquo;</p>

<p>.. pp. 459-466 Yāj, mentions Parāśara, but the extant Parasarasmṛti is pro bably a recast of an older smṛti - Garuḍapurāṇa (chap. 107) gives a summary of 39 verses of Parāśarasmṛti - from Kautilya it appears there was a work of Parāśara on politics in which vyavahāra was also dealt with - extant Parāsara in 12 chapters and 592 verses deals with acara and prayascitta alone - Parāśara, an ancient name - Parāsara mentions 19 smṛti writers - contents of the smrti - Parāśara has peculiar views – authors cited by Parasara – views of Manu frequently cited &ndash; several identical verses in Manu and Parāsara - age of Parāśarasmṛti between 100-500 A.
