PREFACE 

The completion of the second revised and enlarged edition of Volume I of the History of Dharmaśāstra, marked by the publi cation of this its second part, gives us solace and a feeling of redemption. 

Soon after the release of the fifth and final Volume of the History of Dharmaśāstra in November 1962, Professor KANE began working on the revised edition of Volume I. Of course, it was not then visualised that the revision would ultimately result in the Volume becoming almost double its original size. But KANE was not a man to be satisfied with anything less than thorough and exhaustive. As his work of revision was progressing and growing in size, we thought that it would be advisable if the Volume was issued in two parts. The first part was, accordingly, published in May 1968 on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee of the Institute. It was then hoped that the second part also would be published in the course of the next couple of years. 

But unfortunately that was not to be. What with the increa sing difficulties of printing and what with the sudden collapse in KANE's usually sound health, the publication of this second part had to wait - sadly enough - till the third death-anniversary of the author. It is to be particularly regretted that this part had to pass through press without Kane's imprimatur. 

We would like to reiterate, in all humility, that the Institute prides itself upon the kind of reflected glory which it enjoys on account of its close association with the History of Dharmaśāstra which has made a veritable history in the field of Indological studies and research.
