70. Yogloka Yogloka like Jitendriya and Balaka is a writer about whom we know only from the works of Jimītavāhana and Raghunandana. He is the last of the series of writers enume rated in one place by the Kalaviveka as having dealt with the subject of kālu (vide note 611 above). The Vyavahāra mātṛkā of Jimūtavāhana very frequently $15 cites the views of Yogloka and generally twits him with thinking himself as being a logician or a new-fangled (navu-tārkikai-manya) logician. Both in the Kālaviveka and the Vyavaharamātrkā Yogloka is generally cited for being refuted (e. g. pr. 457-58, 465, 483 of the Kālaviveka). It is only very rarely that Jimnātavāhana agrees with Yogloka ( as on p. 369 of the Kāla viveka). From certain passages of the Kālaviveka it follows that Yogloka composed two works, one called Brhad-Yogloka (larger work ) and the other styled Svalpa-Yogloka (a sma ller-work).816 It appears that Yogloka was later than Sri kara and accepted certain illustrations given by the latter, 817 The Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana informs us that like Srikara and Bālaka, Yogloka held the view that twenty years' adverse possession of immovables conferred ownership ( vide note 624 above ). The same work tells us that the Maithilas followed the view of Yogloka that the verse of Kātyāyana (yadyekadeśavyāptā pi....niṇām ) was intended to apply to a case where a litigant threw down the challenge that if even

one out of several items of property charged were brought home to him as having been stolen by him, he would restore all the items claimed, 313 

The foregoing establishes that Yogloka wrote at least on kā!a and vyavaharu and composed two treatises on kūla. 

Jimītavāhanas10 says that is predecessor of his styled Diksita criticized a certain reading of Yogloka's, i. e. Yogloka preceded Dīksita, who was a predecessor of Jimutavāhana. Jimūtavāhana further refers to ancient (purātana ) mss. of Yogloka's work. Hence Yogloka must have preceded Jimūta vāhana by at least a hundred years. He is later than Srikara (note 632 above ). Therefore he must have flourished between 950-1050 A. D.
