      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;65&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dhāresvara Bhojadeva The Mit. (on Yāj. II. 135) says that Dhāreśvara tries to re concile the conflicting texts about the right of the widow to succeed to her husband&amp;rsquo;s estate by saying that she succeeded if her husband was separate and if she was willing to submit to niyoga. On the same verse the Mit. says that following Mānu IX. 217 Dhāreśvara placed the paternal grand-mother immediately after the mother as an heir and even before the father. On Yāj. III. 24 the Mit says that certain texts of Rsyaśṛnga about impurity on death were not accepted as authoritative by Dhāreśvara, Viśvarūpa and Medbātithi. Vide sec. 60 Viśvarūpa about the remarks of the Smṛticandrikā on Dhāreśvara and Viśvarūpa. The Hāralaṭā777 (p. 117) remarks (as does the Mit. on Yaj. III. 24 ) that Bhojadeva, Viśvarūpa, Govindarāja, and the Kāmadhepu did not cite certain texts as Jātukarna&amp;rsquo;s and that therefore they were not authoritative.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That Dhāreśvara is to be identified with Bhojadeva of Dhārā, perhaps the most famous Indian prince as a patron of learned men, follows from several considerations. The Dāya bhāga778 cites Bhojadeva and Dhāreśvara without making any distinction between the two. Some views that are ascribed to Dhāreśvara in one work are ascribed to Bhojadeva in another. The Vivadatāndava of Kamalākara ascribes to Bhoja deva the same views as to the widow&amp;rsquo;s rights as are ascribed to Dhāreśvara by the Mit. Mss. of the Rājamārtaṇḍa (com mentary on the Yogasutras ) have colophons saying that the work was composed by Dhāreśvara Bhojarāja. Dhāreśvara is styled ācārya by the Mit. (on Yaj. III. 24 ) and sūri by the Smṛticandrikā ( II p. 257 ).&amp;rsquo; Works on numerous branches of knowledge were composed by (or in the name of or under ) Bhoja of Dhārā. On Poetics we have two extensive works of his, viz. the Sarasvatikanthabharana and the Sṭngāraprakāśa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;66&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Devasyamin The Smṛticandrikā tells us that Devasvā min composed like Srīkara and Sambhu a work in the nature of a digest of smrtis (smrtisamuccaya ). Vide note 748 above. The com mentary of Nārāyana of the Naidhruva gotra, son of Divākara, on the Asvalāyanagrhyasūtra788 says that it relies upon the bhāsya of Devasvāmin on the same work Gārgya Nārāyana, son of Narasimha, in bis commentary on the Asvalāyana srautasūtra, tells us that he follows the bhāsya of Devasvāmin thereon. It is hardly likely that two writers of the same name flourished about the same time. Hence it may be assumed that Devasvāmin wrote bhāsyas on the Āśvalāyana Srauta and Gșhya sūtras and a digest of smṛtis, where he discussed all topics of dharma, such as ācāra, vyavahāra, āśauca &amp;amp;c. The commentary of Bhattoji789 on the Caturviṇsati mata refers to the view of Devasvāmin on sraddha and āśauca. Hemādri780 ( vol. III, part 2, p. 324 ) and Madhava (on Parāśara, vol. I, part 2, p. 328 ) also quote Devasyāmin. The Smṛticandrikā quotes the views of Devasvāmin on vyavahāra&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;788 आश्वलायनगृह्यस्य भाष्यं भगवता कृतम् । देवखामिसमाख्येन विस्तीर्ण&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;67&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jitendriya Jitendriya is one of those writers who at one time held an eminent position but in course of time sank into unmerited oblivion. The works of Jimūtavāhana bear abundant testi mony to the fact that Jitendriya wrote an extensive work on dharmaśāstra. In his Kālaviveka (p. 380 ) Jimūta vāhana says that Jitendriya797 wrote on the topic of kāla (i. e. on determining doubtful points about the months, the tithis, samkrāntis, &amp;amp;c, and the religious rites to be performed on them ). In several passages of the Kālaviveka the very words of Jitendriya are quoted. Jitendriya said that a rite that occupies in performance only a short time must be per&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;796 Telea ACT BEATI HELG I 3TATATENI SATA Tezia Halfour: 1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He held the view that the daughter&amp;rsquo;s son, not being expressly mentioned as an heir by Yāj., came in after those expressly mentioned from the widow to the brother.305 The Dāyabhāga notices that Balaka read a text of Apastamba in a wrong way.s06 Balaka said that the words of Saṅkha &amp;lsquo;svaryatasya aputrasya bhrātrgāmi dravyam&amp;hellip;jyesthā vā patnī&amp;rsquo; apply either to a widow belonging to a caste other than her husband&amp;rsquo;s or to a very young widow or in case her husband was undivided or re-united.807 Balaka says that when some&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;804 अत एव परकीयत्वेन विशेषतो जानतस्तदपहारे स्तन्यं न तु स्वद्रव्यभ्रमेण परद्रव्य&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;70&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Yogloka Yogloka like Jitendriya and Balaka is a writer about whom we know only from the works of Jimītavāhana and Raghunandana. He is the last of the series of writers enume rated in one place by the Kalaviveka as having dealt with the subject of kālu (vide note 611 above). The Vyavahāra mātṛkā of Jimūtavāhana very frequently $15 cites the views of Yogloka and generally twits him with thinking himself as being a logician or a new-fangled (navu-tārkikai-manya) logician. Both in the Kālaviveka and the Vyavaharamātrkā Yogloka is generally cited for being refuted (e. g. pr. 457-58, 465, 483 of the Kālaviveka). It is only very rarely that Jimnātavāhana agrees with Yogloka ( as on p. 369 of the Kāla viveka). From certain passages of the Kālaviveka it follows that Yogloka composed two works, one called Brhad-Yogloka (larger work ) and the other styled Svalpa-Yogloka (a sma ller-work).816 It appears that Yogloka was later than Sri kara and accepted certain illustrations given by the latter, 817 The Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana informs us that like Srikara and Bālaka, Yogloka held the view that twenty years&amp;rsquo; adverse possession of immovables conferred ownership ( vide note 624 above ). The same work tells us that the Maithilas followed the view of Yogloka that the verse of Kātyāyana (yadyekadeśavyāptā pi&amp;hellip;.niṇām ) was intended to apply to a case where a litigant threw down the challenge that if even&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;815 Vide pp. 291, 293, 295, 310, 312, 313, 347. 818 योग्लोकेन तु स्वल्पबृहद्ग्रन्थभेदेन द्वयमेवोक्तं बलाबलनिरूपणाक्षमत्वात् ।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;71&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vijñanesvara The Mitāksarā of Vijñāneśvara occupies a unique place in the Dharmaśāstra literature. Its position is analogous to that of the Mahabhāsya of Patanjali in grammar or to that of the Kāvyaprakāśa of Mammaṭa in Poetics. It represents the essence of dharmaśāstra speculation that preceded it for about two thousand years and it became the fountain head from which flowed fresh streams of exegesis and developments. Under the decisions of the Courts in British India, the Mitā ksarā is of paramount authority in several matters of Hindu Law (such as adoption, inheritance, partition etc.) through out India except where, as in Bengal, the Dāyabhāya prevails.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Mit. professes to be a commentary on the Yājñava Ikyasmrti. In the colophops of several mss., it is described as Rjumitāksarā, Pramitāksarā or simply Mitākṣarā. These names are probably due to some of the verses appended at the end of the commentary $20 The Mit. is not only a commen tary explaining the verses of Yājṅavalkya, but it is in the&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Unfortunately no ms, of it has been recovered so far, but it has been profusely quoted by a large number of writers on the several topics of Dharmaśāstra. Unexpected light has been thrown on it hy the publication of the Bralima cārikāṇla of the Kalpataru, composed by Laksmidhara, the chief muntriin of the Gāhadvāla king Govindachandra of Kanyakuhja ( Kanoj ) and Banaras. In verse 10 of the Intro duction to Brahmacārikānda he says &amp;lsquo;by him this Kalpa rekja is spread ( trnynte kalpavrkṣah )&amp;rsquo;. In verse 11 he says that a friend of his called Gopāla comprosed a digest based on Smrtis anil adeled his own remarks in prose (Gopālastad Vayasyali avakṛti-viracanam vākyarūpena cakre ) and that&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;this digest will be composed and it will delight learned men&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;75&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Prakasa The Vivādaratnākara of Candleśvara cites the views of Prakāśa scores of times ( e. g. pp. 131, 145, 456, 460,462, 474, 485, 504 etc.). Frequently Prakāsa is coupled with Pārijāta (vide Vivādaratnākara Pp. 145, 2+1, 260, 286, 456 ). On p. 602 of the V. R. the two ( Prakāsa and Pārijāta ) are cited as differing from each other. On pp. 286 and 465 of the V. R., Prakāśa, Pārijāta and Halāyulla are cited together as hold ing the same view. It would be shown under Kalpataru&amp;rsquo; that a work called Maharnava&amp;rsquo; is mentioned in verses 12 and 13 of the Introiluction to the Brahmacārikānda and that the same work is cited in citierent ways as Smrtimahārnava or Mahārnava-prakāśa&amp;rsquo; or simply as Mahārnava&amp;rsquo; or as &amp;lsquo;Prakāśa&amp;rsquo; (e. g. p. 497 ).

D. ), the Madanapāri. jāta ( about 1375 A. 1).) and the Prayogapārijāta ( between 1400-1500 ). But there was an ancient work called Pārijāta quoted by even some of the earliest nibuni hakāries. The Vivādaratnākara regarded the Kaljataru, Parijata Halā yudha and Prakāśa as its most eminent predecessors.893 The Dānaratnākara 90+ quotes several times the views of Pārijāta on gifts. The Smṛtisāra of Harinātha sets out at length tbe order of succession to a sonless inan according to the Pārijāta (vide I, O. Ms. No. 301, folio 134 a ). One of the striking opinions of the Pārijāta was that the widow of a sonless man should raise offspring by niyoga and give the wealth of the deceased to the son so born.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Only three works of his are known and they have all been printed viz: the Kālaviveka (B. I. series, 1905), the Vyavahāramātrkā (published in the memoirs of the Bengal Asiatic Society, vol. III., No. 5, pp. 277-353, edited by the late Ṣir Asutosh Mukerji), the Dāyabhāga (published several times ). It appears that these works were intended to form part of a vast treatise on dharmaśāstra called Dharma ratna, as stated in the Kālaviveka.989 In this work I have used the edition of the Dāyabhāga printed in 1829.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;86&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The Smṛticandrikā of Devannabhatta This is a well-known digest on Dharmaśāstra. An English translation of the portion of it which is concerned with dāyabhāga was published in 1867 by T. Krisnasvami Iyer at Madras. The text has been published by Mr. J. R. Gharpure ( up to śrāddha) in Bombay and also in the Mysore Government Oriental Series ( up to āśauca ). In the following Mr. Gharpure&amp;rsquo;s edition has been used and the Mysore edition for āśauca section.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Smsticandrikā published by Mr. Gharpure is a huge work of large size covering about 736 pages on the topics of some samskāras (88 pages ), Ahnika ( 144 pages ), Vyavahāra ( 332 pages ), and Sraddha ( 172 pages ). According to the colo phons at the end of the sections, it appears that the author was called Devapna-bhattopadhyāya, son of Keśavāditya-bhattopā dhyāya. The fifth introductory verse asserts that all that he writes is based on authoritative texts and that he has stated noth ing purely relying on his own ideas (or imagination ).1068&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He wrote a commentary called Anakulā on the Apastamba-gļhya-sūtra (D.C. Ms. No. 2 of 1866-68), a commentary on the Apastambiya mantra-pātha ( vide Dr. Winternitz&amp;rsquo;s ed. of 1897, p. XIII.), a com mentary called Anāvila on the Asvalāyana-gļhya-sūtra ( published in the Trivandrum Series ), a commentary called Mitāksarā on the Gautamadharmasūtra and a commentary named Ujjvalā on the dharmasūtra of Āpastamba. His commentaries are very good models of ideal commentaries. His commentary on the dharma sutra of Gautama (printed by the Anandasrama Press, Poona ) is more concise than that on the Dharmasūtra of Apastamba ( large extracts of which were published by Būhler in his edition in the B. S. Series, the whole being printed by Halasyanath Sastri at Kumbhakonam and in the Mysore Government Oriental Library Series ). In bis commentary on the Dharmasūtras he quotes verses from numerous smstis and from the purāṇas but hardly ever mentions by name any commentator or nibandhakāra. In his Anavilā (page 9 ) he quotes the views of a Bhāsyakāra who is probably Devasvamin and mentions also a Candogagļhyabhāsya kāra (on 1. 2. 3). In his commentaries on both the Dharmasūtras he frequently quotes the opinions of previous commentators with the words &amp;lsquo;anye,&amp;rsquo; aparah,&amp;rsquo; kecit;&amp;rsquo; vide G. Dh. S.

Hemādri is a very voluminous writer. He is the author of the Caturvarga cintamani, an encyclopedia of ancient religious rites and observances. From ancient times in India the goals of human life (puruṣārthas ) were said to be four viz. Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokșa ( and were spoken of as Caturvarga&amp;rsquo;). Moksa could be attained only by a few men but as to the other three ( spoken of as Trivarga ) all could secure them, according to their abilities and activities (vide Manu II. 224). This subject of Purusārthas has been dealt with at some length in H. of Dh. Vol. II. pp. 2-11, Vol. III. pp. 8-10 and 241-43 and Vol. V. pp. 1626-1632. According to the statements contained in the work itself the author intended to treat Dharmasastra in five sections, called vrata, dāna, tirtha, moksa and pariśesa. 1103 The Parisesa khanda was divided into four parts, viz., Devatā, Kālanirṇaya, Karmavipaka, Laksaṇasamuccaya.104 The Caturvarga-cintamani has been published in the Bibliotheca Indica Series. Four volumes containing 6 parts and covering about 6009 pages have been so far printed. The second and third volumes have two parts each. The fourth volume which deals with prāvascitta does not appear to be the work of Hemadri.l105 The work so far published is concerned with vrata, dāna, śrāddha and kāla (latter two being parts of the Pariseṣa-khanda ). That portion of the Caturvarga cintāmaṇi which was intended to treat of tirtha and mokșa has not yet come to light. It is extremely doubtful whether the author&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It has been printed several times. In the following the Nirnayasāgara edition of 1909 has been relied upon. Kullūka&amp;rsquo;s commentary is concise and lucid and his remarks are always to the point. He avoids all unnecessary discussions and is never prolix. He was not however original. He drew upon the com mentaries of Medhātithi and Govindarāja and incorporated a great deal from them into his own work without acknowledgment. For example, on Manu XI. 95 he simply summarises the remarks1126 of Govindaraja and cites only one out of the several quotations that are found in Govindarija&amp;rsquo;s Manu-tika. He severely criticizes both Medhātithi and Govindaraja, particularly the latter. He frequently pours ridicule on the latter ( vide note 903° above). At the end of his commentary he saysilar that Medhātithi&amp;rsquo;s skill lay in expounding what texts were authorita tive and of substance and what were not so. Govindarāja in concise words explained the hidden meaning of the brief text ( of Manu ), while Dharanidhara had his own method of expla nation which was independent of previous tradition; and there fore he undertook to write a commentary that would clearly set forth the real meaning of Manu. He was very proud of his achievement and says that neither Medhātithi nor Govindarāja nor other commentators explained in the way he did and that explanatory material like his would be difficult to find else&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;94 Madanapala and Viśyeśvarabhatta&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Madanapārijāta compiled under the patronage of king Madanapala by Viśvesvarabhatta is a famous work. Like Bhoja, Madanapala seems to have been a great patron of learning and several works are attributed to him. At least four works on dharmaśāstra are ascribed to him (i. e. were written under his patronage ) viz. the Madanapārijāta, Smṛtimahārnva or Madana mahārṇava, Tithinirṇayasāra and Smṛtikaumudi. Four more works are ascribed to Madanapala that deal with subjects other than those of Dhasmasastra viz. Madanavinodanighantu, Surya siddhāntaviveka, Siddhantagarbha and Yantraprakāśa.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Introduction to that edition (pp. VIII-IX ) may be consulted for more information. In the colophons of mss. it is also called Madanaratnapradipa or simply Madanapradipa. The work was divided into seven1228 sections called uddyotas on samaya (or kala), ācāra, vyavahāra, prāyaścitta, dāna, śuddhi, śānti. The order of the various sections was the one indicated, the samayo ddyota being the first part. I have not been able to examine the mss. of all the uddyotas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is thought advisable that a separate section be de voted to Vidyapati in this revised edition, Dr. Umesh Mishra published in Hindi1235 a life of Vidyapati; he gives the pedigree which shows that he was fourth in descent from Dhireśvara, uncle of Candeśvara. That work deals at some length with the lineage of Vidyāpati, gives a brief account of the kings of Mithila, the times of Vidyāpati, his works his padas, (songs) his learning and similar matters. There is difference of opinion about the date of his birth among scholars but there appears to be agreement about the date of his death viz. 1448 A. D. His birth place was Bisapi, a village in Madhubani ( lit. forest of honey) on the eastern side of north Bihar. The ‘Love Songs of Vidyāpati&amp;rsquo;, translated into English from Maithili by Mr. Deben Bhattacharya and edited with an Introduction, Notes and comments by W. G. Archer, were published in London in 1963 by George Allen and Unwin (Ltd.). It was preceded by the publication of the Songs of Vidyāpati rendered into English by Shri Subhadra Jha in 1954, published by Messrs Motilal Banarsidas (of Benares ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rangaswami Aiyangar and his pupil Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar published in the Adyar Library Series ( Madras ) an edition of the Vyava hāranirṇaya of Varadarāja based on nine mss.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One remarkable feature of the work is that it has no Mangala śloka at the beginning. Prof. Aiyangar suggests that this is so because it is only a part of a large work. I am not satisfied with the suggestion. The work could have been begun by saying &amp;rsquo; after completing the part on the subject already finished I (or Varadaraja ) begin &amp;lsquo;&amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His Suddhi-viveka has been published several times (at Benares in 1866, in 1878, and by the Venkateśvara Press in Bombay, samvat 1978). That work is divided into three paricchedas and deals with purification from impurity on birth and death, the persons liable to undergo purifications, the mean ing of the word putra, purification of the body and of various substances when polluted, purification of cooked food and water and women in their menses. He tells us that after1266 having examined seven works ( nibandhas) on suddhi and being encoura ged by his father and brother he composed the Suddhiviveka. He further says that he made the effort for the benefit of those who were not disposed to go through such works as the Ratnakara, Pārijāta, Mitākṣarā and the Hāralatā.1267 Besides these he mentions the Acarādarśa, Suddhipradipa, Suddhi-bimba, Sridattopadhyāya, Smrtisāra and Harihara,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is a ms, of the Vivādacandra in the Deccan College (No. 57 of 1883-84). That work deals with the titles of Law (vyavahāra padas ) such as ļṇādāna (recovery of debt), nyāsa (deposit), asvāmivikraya, sambhūya-samutthana (partnership), dāyavibhāga, stridhana; and then with procedure, viz. the plaint, reply, pramānas, witnesses, possession etc. It frequently quotes the Ratnākara ( on vivāda and vyavahāra ) of Candeśvara and several times criticizes him. Besides numerous smṛti writers the other authors and works named are : Parijāta, Prakāśa, Bālarūpa (often ), Bhavadeva and Smstisāra ( frequently ).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His Vivadacintamani had been recognised by the High Courts in India and by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as a work of paramount authority on matters of Hindu Law in Mithila. 278 His literary activity was closely connected with the reigns of two kings of Mithilā, viz. Bhairavendra or Bhairavasimha ( also styled Harinārāyana ) and his son Rāma bhadra (called also Rūpanārāyana ), both of the Kameśvara dynasty. Vacaspati was an extremely voluminous writer and appears to have composed dozens of works. In the Sraddhakapla alias Pitsbhakti-taraigini, almost his latest work, he says that he wrote in his youth ten works on sastra and thirty nibandhas on smīti and composed the work in question in his declining years.1277 At least eleven works of his bearing the title &amp;lsquo;cintā maṇi&amp;rsquo; are known. They are briefly noticed below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He compiled an encyclopædic work on the different branches of dharmaśāstra styled Smṛtitattva, divided into 28 sections called tattvas. He cites the names of over 300 authors and works in his encyclopaedia, which have been collected together by M. M, Chakravarti (JASB for 1915 pp. 363-375). His wonderful mastery over smrti material and his erudition displayed in the Smsti-tattva earned for him the appellation smārtabhattācārya or simply smārta&amp;rsquo; from later writers. For example, the Vīramitrodaya refers to him in that way and so does Nilakantha in his Vyavahāramayukha,1341 His Smṛtitattva was printed at Serampore in Bengali characters so far back as 1834 35 A, D. The Smrtitattva was published by Jivananda in 1895 (in two volumes ) in 1631 pages. Out of 28 tattvas the Rgvedi vssotsargatattva is not included in Jivananda&amp;rsquo;s edition; but for a brief note on Ṛgvedivisotsargata ttva, vide Mitra&amp;rsquo;s Notices, vol. VII p. 119 No. 2349 ( which follows the procedure laid down by Saunaka). The Srāddhatattva (in Jivananda&amp;rsquo;s ed. vol. I. pp. 189– 325) is really Sāmasrāddhatattva, since Raghunandana being a Bengali Rādhiya brāhmaṇa was a Sāmavedin. He begins by quoting in the very first lines of this part Gobhila : &amp;lsquo;Atha Pārvapaśrāddham tatra Gobhilāḥ \ Atha śrāddham amāvāsyā yām pitrbhyo dadyat&amp;rsquo;. On many pages he quotes Gobhila grhysūtra, as on pp. 195 (twice ), 196, 203, 207, 209, 210, 213, (twice ), 218, 228, 233 (twice ), 235 ( several times ), 238, 240, 242, 245, 259, 273 ( five lines quoted ), 282, 288, (6 lines ), 307 ( 6 lines ). The Tithitattva ( in Jivananda&amp;rsquo;s edition) men tions on p. 93 (vol. I) a Durgāpūjātattva (pūjāyām visesastu Durgāpājātattveṣvasandheyah) and at the end of the 2nd vol. of Jivananda&amp;rsquo;s edition there is Sri-Durgārcanapaddhati, which is the same as the Durgā pūjā-prayogatattva published by the Sanskrit Sahitya Pariṣad, Calcutta. He wrote also a Tirtha&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Vasiṣtha (to whom and his family are ascribed the verses in the VII Mandala of the Rgveda ) and Viśvāmitra (to whom are ascribed the verses of the 3rd Mandala of the same Veda ). It appears from æg. III. 53. 9-12 that Viśvāmitra&amp;rsquo;s ancestor was Kuśika and that his prayers helped Bhārata people. At least as early as the Mahābhāṣya (vol. II p. 254 of Kielhorn&amp;rsquo;s ed.) of Patañjali ( on Pāṇ IV.1.101 ) the pedi gree was Kuśika-Gādhi-Viśvāmitra. The name Gādbi does not occur in the Rgveda, The Mabābhārata and some of the Purāṇas are full of stories about the rivalry between Viśvā mitra and Vasiṣtha. For enmity (vaira ) between the two sages, vide Ādi chap. 175-176, Chitrashala ed. The gotra of the family was Viśvāmitra and the family is known as Gādhivamśa. In Rg. III, 33. 5 Viśvāmitra is said to be sūnu (son) of Kusika. The plural of Kuśika ocourg frequently in the Rg. Sarkarabhatta also composed a work called Dvaitanirṇaya, an account of which contributed by the present author will be found in ABORI vol. III pp. 67-72 ( for 1921-22 ). The Gādhivaiśānucarita of Sarkarabhatta does not mention the fact of the re-establishment of Viśveśvara by bis father Nārāyaṇabhatta. It is later descendants of Nārāyaṇabhatta that refer to this deed of Nārāyaṇabhatta. It is possible that Śhaṅkarabhatta wrote the Gādbivaman ucarita before the restoration of Visreśvara shrine. Nārāyaṇabhatta appears to have composed a work called&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;110&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Nandapandita Nandapandita was a voluminous writer on dharmaśāstra. An account of his principal works on dharmaśāstra is given below, particularly because most of them are yet unpublished. He was also called Vināyaka as stated in his commentary ( named Suddhi-candrika) on the Sadasiti (also called Aśaucanirṇaya ) of Aditya of the Kausika-gotra. Nandapandita came of the Dharmādhikari family of Benares and is described as the son of Dharmadhikāri Ramapandita. There were several families in Benares famous for their learned works on Dharmaśāstra and other branches such as the Bhātta family (to which belonged Bhattanārāyaṇa, Kamalākara and Nilakantha ), the Dharmādhi kāri family and the Sesa family. This last had Sesakssa, his son Viśveśvara, whose three pupils viz. Jagannathapandita, Bhattoji Dikșita and Anṇambhatta, author of Tarkasangraha, distinguished themselves as great scholars in their own special studies,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He composed a commentary called Vidvanmanoharā on the Parāśarasmsti. He expressly mentions therein that he follows the commentary of Madhavācārya.1331 This commentary is referred to in his Vaijayanti. 1382&lt;/p&gt;</description>

D. 118&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;938&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;history of Nilakantha, his works, their contents, their position in dharmaśāstra literature, the period of Nilakantha&amp;rsquo;s literary activity and his position in modern Hindu Law. In the following a brief résumé of the conclusions there arrived at is given.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nilakantha was a grandson of Nārāyanabhatta and a son of Śhaṅkarabhatta. Śhaṅkarabhatta was a profound mimāṁsaka and composed several works on mimāṁsā, viz. a com. on the Śāstradipikā, the Vidhirasāyaṇadusana, the Mimamsābalaprakasa. He also wrote Dvaitanirṇaya (vide Annals of the Bhandarkar Institute, vol. III part 2. pp. 67-72 for an account of it) and the Dharmaprakāśa or Sarvadharmaprakāśa. Nilakantha composed an encyclopaedia of religious and civil law, styled Bhagavanta bhaskara, in honour of his patron Bhagavantadeva, a Bundella chieftain of the Sengara clan, that ruled at Bhareha near the confluence of the Jumna and the Chambal. This work is divided into 12 sections ( called mayukhas &amp;lsquo;rays &amp;lsquo;) on samskāra, ācāra, kāla (or samaya ), srāddha, niti, vyavahāra, dāna, utsarga, pratișthā, prāyaścitta, suddhi, śānti. These have been printed at Benares and some of them have been printed in Bombay at the Gujarati Press and all twelve between 1921–28 A. D. by Mr. Ghar pure.

Excepting the Caturvarga-cintamani of Hemādri, this work is probably the largest known on dharmaśāstra. But it surpasses in interest and usefulness even Hemādri&amp;rsquo;s work since it deals with vyavahāra also. It was divided into sections called prakāśus.

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;116&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Bālakṣsna or Bālambhatta The Lakṣmivyākhyāna alias the Bālambhatti is a commentary on the Mītāksarā of Vijñāneśvara, ascribed to a lady named Laksmidevi. The commentary is a voluminous one and displays uneven workmanship. The commentary on the acāra section of the Mitāksarā is the most learned part of the whole book and is almost an independent work. The late Mr. J. R. Gharpure published all the three parts on acara (pp. 626), Vyavahāra (pp. 402) and Prāyaścitta (pp. 220). The portion on Prayascitta is very meagre as compared with the portion of the com. on Acāra and Vyavahāra. The commentary on the Prāyascitta portion of the Mitā kṣarā covers in Mr. Gharpure&amp;rsquo;s edition (published in 1924) 220 pages, while the Balambhatti on the ācāra and Vyavahāra sections in the same series is very exhaustive, covering respectively pp. 626 and pp. 402.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the Balambhatti the author quotes by name a host of writers and works. As the Balambhatti is almost the latest work of Dharmaśāstra worth special mention in this work, no useful chronological purpose will be served by giving the names of all such writers and works. It may, however, be stated that he names the Nirnayasindhu, the Viramitrodaya, the Mayūkhas of Nilakantha, the Samskārakaustubha, Siddhesvarabhatta the nep hew of Nilakantha, Khandadeva the author of Bhāttadipikā on the Mimāṁsāsūtra, the Kayasthadharmapradipa of Gāgābhatta and the author&amp;rsquo;s father&amp;rsquo;s commentary thereon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;ol start=&#34;119&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the foregoing pages most of the classical works and the most prominent writers on Dharmaśāstra during a period of about twenty-five centuries have been passed in review. The number of authors and works on dharmaśāstra is legion. All these numberless authors and works were actuated by the most laudable motives of regulating the Aryan society in all matters, civil, religious and moral, and of securing for the members of that society happiness in this world and the next. They laid the greatest emphasis on the duties of every man as a member of the whole Aryan society, as a member of the particular class to which he belonged and very little emphasis on the privileges of men. They created great solidarity and cohesion among the several classes of the Aryan society in India in spite of their conflicting interests and inclinations and enabled Hindu society to hold its own against successive aggre ssions of foreign invaders. They preserved Hindu culture and literature in the midst of alien cultures and in spite of bigoted foreign domination. There is no doubt that the authors on dharmaśāstra in their desire to evolve order out of chaos and to adjust and harmonise the varying practices of people with the dicta of ancient sages were guilty of the faults of raising hair-splitting arguments, divisions and sub-divisions and also of thinking that religious rites and formularies were the be-all and end-all of human existence. But living as, most of the later writers did, in the midst of aggressive and violently unsympathetic cultures and rulers and possessing no powerful central government that sympathised with their ideals, they were driven more and more to revolve within their own narrow grooves and could not see far in order to regulate society in a free and buoyant spirit.
