98. Sūlapāṇi 

Jimūtavahana, Sūlapini and Raghunındana are the three leading and very eminent writers on Dharmaśāstra from Bengal, Rai Bahadur Manomohan Chakravarti in his learned and long paper • Contributions to the History of Snısti in Bengal and Mithila ' in J. A. S. B. ( New Series) Vol. XI (1915) deals with Bengal authors on Smsti in pp. 311-406 and deals with Sūlapāni in pp. 336–343 giving a very interesting account of his works and time. 

The earliest work of Śūlapāṇi appears to have been his Dipa kalikā, a commentary on the smiṛti of Yājñavalkya. It is a very brief commentary. Rai Bahadur M. M. Chakravarti had no

printed edition of the Dipakalikā and relied upon a ms. from the Sanskrit College. The Dipakalikālz43 was published by Mr. Gharpure in 1939 in his series of Hindu Law texts. Raghu. nandana quotes or refers to it very often in spite of its small size (vide vol. I, Sraddha, pp. 201, 208, 225, 247; Ahnika 454; Prayascitta 543, 546; vol. II Udvaha 138, Vyavahara 224, 225; Divya 577. The portion on the dayabhāga section (Yajnavalkya II, verses 114-149) is contained in five printed pages ( vide Ghose's Hindu Law, edition of 1917, vol. II. pp. 550-554). In this commentary, besides the sages he names only a few writers and works on dharma, e. g. the Kalpataru, Govindaraja, the Mitākṣarā, Medhātithi and Viśvarūpa. He entertained somewhat archaic views on matters of inheritance. For example, he holds that the text speaking of the right of the parents to succeed before the brothers of the deceased has reference to property acquired by the deceased from his father or grand-father. He explained the word 'apratisthita' in the sutra of Gautama 'stridhanam duhi tļṇāmaprattānām-apratișthitānāṁ ca' in the same way as Apararka, Jimitavahana and the Smrticandrika.1244 He says that a full brother though not re-united succeeded before a half-brother 

1243 The दीपकलिका ( ed. by Gharpure ) covers only 110 pages but 

mentions a large number of smrti works, and authors : गौतम धर्मसूत्र, बोधायन, बृहस्पति, वृद्धबृहस्पति, भरद्वाज, मनु, बृहन्मनु ( verse अन्यायोपात्त.), वृद्धमनु ( verse अपुत्रा शयनं ), मरीचि, यम, वसिष्ठ, विश्वरूप (p. 81), विश्वामित्र, विष्णु, व्यास, शङ्ख ( prose once), शङ्खलिखित (prose 12 times ), शातातप, वृद्धशातातप, शौनक ( once), संवर्त, सनन्द (once), सुमन्तु, हारीत ( both prose and verse ), कल्पतरु, छन्दोगपरिशिष्ट, महा भारत ( 4 times ), रामायण ( once आकारश्छद्यमानोपि०), आयुर्वेद (once), सुश्रुत ( twice). It quotes several पुराण ( some of them often ) आदि, कूर्म, नृसिंह, पद्म, ब्रह्म ( 10 times), भविष्य ( 13 times ), मार्कण्डेय, विष्णु, स्कन्द. In प्राय. वि. pp. 390-91 he states-'विवाह्याविवाह्यस्त्री विशेषश्च याज्ञवल्क्यटीकायामस्माभिरभिहितः । सगोत्रादिकन्यानां चाज्ञानतो विवाह इदं यथा बौधायनः सगोत्रां चेदमत्योपगच्छेत् मातृवेदनां बिभृयात् । प्रजाता चेत् कृच्छाब्दपादं चरित्वा जन्मन आत्मनो वेदाग्निभूतः पुनरग्निश्चक्षुरादित्येताभ्यां

though re-united.1346 This explanation of the much canvassed verse of Yāj. offered by Sulapāṇi is referred to by the Viramitro daya.1248 The Vyavahāratattva of Raghunandana several times refers to Sūlapāpi's explanations of Yāj. 1247 

In the Prayaścittaviveka (p. 390 of Jivananda's ed.) Śūlapāṇi states that he has already composed a commentary on Yāj. The Suddhitattva (vol. II p. 380) mentions that solapani also com posed • Parisista-dipakalikā': 

Śūlapāṇi wrote several small treatises on topics of dharma sāstra. It is doubtful whether he contemplated or proposed to make them parts of a huge digest on Smrti. At least twelve tractales of his ending in the wotd • Viveka’ are known. Chakra varti on p. 337 of his paper opines that the several 'small treatises formed parts of general treatise by name the Smrtiviveka.' With great respect I demur to this conclusion. He nowhere drops even a hint that he meant these large and small treatises to be parts of a Smṛtiviveka viz. Ekadasi-viveka, Tithi-viveka, Dattaka-viveka, Durgotsavaprayoga-viveka, Durgotsava-viveka, Dolayātrā-viveka, Pratiṣthā-viveka, Prāyaścitta-viveka, Rasayātrā-viveka, Vratakāla viveka, Suddhi-viveka, Srāddha-viveka, Samkrānti-viveka, Sam bandha-viveka (on marriage ). Of these the Durgotsavaviveka seems to have been amongst his latest works, since he names therein five of his vivekas on durgotsava-prayoga, pratisthā, prāyāscitta, suddhi and śrāddha. The Śrāddha-viveka is the most famous of his works and has been printed. His Prāyaścittaviveka and Durgotsava-viveka have also been published, the former by Jivananda (1893) and the latter by the Sanskrit Sahitya Parisad at Calcutta in Bengali characters. In the Durgotsava-viveka he deals with the worship of Durgā in Asvina and also in spring (hence the deity is called Vasanti). In the Durgotsava viveka, besides such purāṇas as the Kalıkā, Bhavisyottara, Bhāgayata,

Devi, he names a host of writers and works as noted below.1248 In spite of Aufrecht's view the Samvatsara-pradipa is not his own work. The Samvatsarapradipa mentioned by Śūlapāni in Durgo tsavaviveka appears to have been a work of Halayudha, as Raghu nandana states in Ekādasitattva (vol. II. p. 51, “Samvatsara pradipe Halāyudhopi etanmatīnusāri') and in Suddhi (Vol. II p. 327 ata eva samvatsara-pradipe Halayudhenoktam ). The Samvatsarapradipa without the author's name is quoted by Raghunandana many times, as in (vol. I) Tithi (pp. 34, 43, 49, 106 ); Śrāddha, p. 250, Prāyaścitta p. 508, Malamasa pp. 754, 848; in vol. II Ekadasi pp. 8, 40, 61-62, 65, 83, and Suddhi 382. A Sārasamuccaya is also mentioned in Hemādri (Dānakhanda page 135). The Smstisāgara is probably the same as the Govindārṇava of Seșa Nṭsimha, Srikaramiśra is probably the ancient author referred to even by the Mitakṣarā. 

Sūlapāṇi is mentioned by name by Raghunandana in some places without any title ( as in vol. I Malamasa pp. 748, 854–55; Vol. II. p. 577 Divya ), sometimes as upadhyāya (vol. I. Daya 175 ) and very often as Mahāmahopadhyāya (as in vol. I Prāyas citta pp. 528, 553; vol. II. Vyavahāra p. 197, Suddhi p. 296 ). Brief notes may be added on a few of his works. 

The Sambandhaviveka1249 was edited by Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri (Calcutta ) in 1942 with an Introduction of 23 pages dealing with the origin and development of the forms of marriage (8 forms in the Gaut. Dh. S. and in Aśv. Gș. I. 6) and contain

सारसमुच्चय, स्मृतिसागर. 1249 The text in the edition by Dr. Chaudhuri of the Sambandha 

vivek u contains only 15 pages. But about one-third or more of each page is covered by various readings. So the text by itself would occupy only about six or seven printed pages of a small size book in modern times. As there were hardly any printing presses for Sanskrit works before the advent of the British and as the different parts of India were separated by the barriers of language and usages and were governed by different dynasties, each region produced its own compilations in Sanskrit, particularly on matters of Dharmaśāstra.

ing a few remarks on the work of Sūlapāṇi. A work of the same name by Bhavadevabhatta who flourished at least three centuries before Sūlapāṇi has also been edited by Dr. S. C. Banerjee in N. I. A. Vol. VI. pp. 97-102. A comparison of the works of the same name by Bhavadeva and Sulapiṇi would be interesting but reasons of space prevent any such attempt. It is a misnomer to speak of the small treatises of Silapāṇi as granthas or nibandhas. It is cumbersome and unnecessary to mention and describe all the writings of Sulapāṇi (in a work like the present general History of Dharmaśāstra ) said to be 23 by Dr. S. C. Banerjee in N. I. A. vol. V. pp. 169-176. 

For the Dolayātrāviveka one has to turn to the volume of studies presented to the present author on his completing 60 years on the 7th May 1941, to which Dr. S. C. Banerji contributed a paper containing the text of Dolayātrāviveka of Sūlapāṇi (pp. 56-62 ) based on seven mss. belonging to the Dacca University mss, library. It is a small tract of about five printed pages (if the footnotes about different readings of the mss. be excluded ). Dolayātrā means the festival of swinging (of the image of Krsna ). Half of the work is taken from Skandapurāṇa, some verses are also quoted from the Brabmapurāṇa and Devipurāṇa and the work called Bhujabalabhima is also cited. The festival may be celebrated for three days or five days. Ordinarily it is celebrated on the full moon day of Phālguna (but questions arise when Paurnimā is mixed with Caturdaśi) or with Uttaraphālguni nakṣatra. The conclusions are stated in the note below1250 when one or two of the three required particulars are wanting. 

A few words are required to be said on the two extensive and important works of Śūlapāni, viz. Prayascittaviveka and Sraddhaviveka. But the Sraddhaviveka not being available to me in Devanāgari script, I have had to give up the idea of say, ing something about it. The first was printed over seventy years ago by Jivananda with the commentary of Govindānanda called

Tattvārthakaumudi and contains 544 printed pages. Hundreds of Prāyaścittas on serious and insignificant transgressions are mentioned in this work. It is difficult to believe that all these (or even large portions ) were actually practised by the people in the author's days or even centuries before him. A brief statement of its contents is given here.— Etymology1981 of the word Prayascitta according to Angiras and Harita ; how sins are incurred ( acc. to Manu XI. 43, Yaj. III. 219-220); the effect of sins are experienced in the present life itself or in another life (Yaj. III. 32-33 ); sinners fall into hell or are born with bodily defects (Manu XI. 49, 52); narakas (hells ) are many acc. to Manu IV. 88–90; two views -- one is that the results of every act must be endured and there is no escape from them; the other is that results of sins may be avoided or mitigated by appropriate acts and penances declared in the śāstras ( Manu XI. 45, 46, 53 ); distinction between sins committed through ignorance and sins committed of set purpose ( Yaj. III. 226 ); sinner should approach a pariṣad (assembly of learned men) or the king; consti tution of pariṣad for prescribing appropriate penances (pp. 27-29); various methods for reducing or removing effects of sins (Manu XI. 227, 230 ); enumeration of penances like kṛcchra, cāndrāyana, prajāpatya, santapana, paraka; secret penances like japa of mantras and homas; nine kinds of sins, such as atipātaka, mabāpātaka, anupataka, upapataka, jātibhramsakara &c.; enumeration and definitions of these; acc. to Viṣṇu (34. 1) there are three utipātakas viz. incest with mother, daughter or daughter-in-law; Manu does not mention atipātakas as a distinct class; for Atipātakas, penance for these is entering into fire; Prayaścittas for the five Mahāpātakas (in Manu XI. 57); upapātakas are 38 in Manu (XI. 59-66); Jāti bhramsakara are sins mentioned in Manu XI. 67-70; penances for Mahāpatakas; no sin incurred when a brāhmaṇa who is being treated medically dies (Yaj. III. 284); Manu (VIII. 350-52) and many ancient sages very clearly accept the right of private

defence by stating that even if one's guru or a boy or an old man or a learned brāhmana approaches with a weapon to harm a person, the latter should kill him without further thought"268 ; penances for killing a brāhmaṇa ( 13 indicated by Manu XI. 72–82 as stated in the Pr. Viveka p. 65 ); but this applies only when killing is not of set purpose; P. ( stands for Prāyascitta or Prāyaścittas in this summary') for those who abet killing or who encourage or merely approve; P. are more severe according as the culprit in the case of killing a brāhmana is a Ksatriya or of another varṇa or even in other offences (than killing a brāhmara); Daksiṇā in penances depends upon the means of the guilty person; penances for drinking surā ;1253 meaning of surā (Manu XI. 93 ), since all intoxicants are not regarded as surā (pp. 89 ff.); P. for theft of gold (pp. 107--127); 

1252 

Similar provisions occur in Matsya-purāṇa, chap. 227. 115-117 Prāyaścitta V. of Sūlapāpi (pp.59-60 ) quotes Manu VIII, 351. and remarks that the words Hanyād-eva' show that there is no alternative and the only action is to kill that brāhmaṇa offender (evahiro niya rithah ) and the Dandaviveka (p. 240) of Vardhamāna repeats these words of Sulapāpi. Vide an elaborate paper on 'Atatāyivadha' by Prof. Rangaswami Aiyanyar in C. K. Raja Felicitation volume pp. 197–232. The Chāndogyopaniṣad ( V. 10. 9) enumerates the fire Maha pātakıs in the verse steno kiranyasya .... pañcamas-cācaca raistar-iti'. Manu IV. 162 and VIIT, 350 ( = Matsyapurāṇa 227. 115 ) appear to be inconsistent with each other. Therefore The Sar. V. p. 155 holds that the latter deals only with the punishment for) Atatāyi brāhmaṇay. Eien in the Rgveda (VII. 86.6) Vasiṣtha appears to plead with God Varupa that man commits sin under the influence of surī, wrath, gambling, thoughtiessness and in VIII. 2. 12 refers to brawls (or fights) arising among people intoxicated by surā. The Prāyaścitta V. (p. 89) quotes & Śruti Surā vai malam annānām' and adds 'yadyapi annusabdah....odane prasi ddhastathāpi ... piṣta-yavāgvādivikāramapi lakṣayati tenā nnavıkāraviṛeṣo madahetuh suretyu yate' and cites Manu XI. 93 Surā vai malai annānāin dc,' and then quotes two verses of Pulastya, in which eleven kiods of iutoxicating drinks are specified as varieties of marlyn, are distinguished from surā and it is expressly provided that all hiuds of mariya are not

A few of the original basic texts ( not many in number ), that were full of differences of opinion among the sages and had to be reconciled or explained away somehow, may be cited here in the original. Many of the medieval writers cite them and seek to bring order out of them. तस्मा समानादेव पुरुषदत्ता चाद्यश्च जायत इदं हि चतुर्थे पुरुषे तृतीये संगच्छामहे इति वि देवं दीव्यमाना जात्या आसने एतम्मादु तत् । शतपथ ब्रा.

pp. 117-118 about the meaning of the word Mleccha and for the return to the Hindu fold of persons carried away by Mlecchas or robbers and made to eat forbidden things and to do dirty jobs as slaves. The Prāyaścittaviveka of Sūlapāni (pp. 455-456 ) quotes verses ( 17-22 ) of Devala ( that occur in the collection of Smrtis of the Anan. Press). Devala was liberal enough to prescribe that hy proper prāyaścittas & person carried away hy inleechas and made to eat even condemned flesh and to live like one of them may be taken back in the Hindu fold within four years and that after four years he becomes assimilated to the Allecchas, has to die as a mleccha and thus death frees hin from the taint. It is very creditable to Sūlapāṇi that he quotes these verses of Devala, that he accepts them in toto and does not try to treat them as not applical;le in his days or explain them away in some other way.

silver māsaka (p. 522 ); Prājāpatyavrata held equal to the gift of a cow yielding milk (pp. 525, 528-29 ) or its price; Gautama dharmasutra ( 19. 11-18 ) prescribed various optional prayascittas (for purification ) viz. Japa (of sacred texts ), tapas, homa, fast and gifts and among gifts of cows also there were certain options (Pr. Viveka pp. 530-534 quoting Manu XI. 127–130, Yāj. III. 266-67); P. for twelve years may be held equal to donating 180 cows yielding milk (p. 538); on p. 538 Parāka is held equal to gift of five milk-yielding cows1258 and these equations are mainly based on the dicta of authoritative texts (pp. 539-40 ) and Sūlapāṇi discusses here and there the reasonableness of these equations (on pp. 538-544). 

The Prāyaścittaviveka is very often referred to by Raghu nandana in his Smstitattva. Vide (vol. 1.) Tithi pp. 28, 90 (Prāyāścittavi vekakstām mate tu); Ahnika pp. 341, 350; Prayas citta 467, 470, 472, 477, 481 (criticised ), 485, 513, 517 tac-cin tyam ); Vol. Il-Ekādaśī p. 8, 15, (Prāyascittavivekakrdbhih); Udvaha p. 112, Dāyatattva p. 182; Suddhi p. 283. The Sraddha viveka is also frequently mentioned, e. g. (vol. I) Tithi pp. 12, 18, 154; Śrāddha pp. 190, 194, 206, 223, 271, 290; Prāyaścitta p. 471, Malao pp. 769, 801, 850 (plural kļdbhiḥ' used ); vol. II. Ekadasi pp. 85, 179; Suddhi p. 377. It appears, from the fact that the honorific plural is used by Raghunandana when referring to the author, that Sulapāṇi was alive or recently dead when Raghunandana began to collect material for his work. 

Among the authors and works (omitting Dharmasūtras, Smrtis and their authors ) the following may be cited as men tioned by Sūlapāṇi in Prayascittaviveka : Kapardibhāṣya (p. 536); Kalpataru ( several times as on pp. 104, 144, 149, 155, 178, 180, 359, 364); Govindaraja (p 91); Jikana (about 18 times as on pp.19, 50, 86, 94, 97 &c. ), Dharmapradipa ( about a dozen times pp. 209, 257, 281, 335, 347, 366, 379, 401, 442, 446, 477, 526 ( those under lined dissented from ); Dhūreśvara (p. 61, same as Bhojadeva); Bālaka (pp. 43, 55, 93, 125, 131 on gurvanganā ), pp. 149, 146, 364 

1259 

It may be noted that from p. 522 to p. 514 Sūlapāṇi deals with establishing equivalences among certain vrata: (or Prāyaścittas ) inter se and also equivalence of some vratas with gifts of milk-yielding cows in certain numbers.

(dissented from); Bhartryajña (p. 254), Rājan (Bhojadeva) 150,152, 157; Lakṣmidhara 319, Viśvarūpa 91, 119; Śrikara 66 (dissented from ); M. M. Chakravarti (JASB. 1911, p. 339) does not mention Kapardibhāsya and Bhartsyajña. On pp. 98, 139, 536-37 Śūlapāṇi refers to Mahadevapada and on p. 118 Srimaheśvara, all referring to God Śiva as the interlocutor in the Bhaviṣya Purāṇa. 

The chronological relation between Salapāṇi and Vācaspati miśra appears to be this that Sūlapāṇi was the older of the two, though they appear to refer to each other. For example, the Dvaitanirṇaya of Vacaspati (p. 102 in the Sāstramālā Series of Benares ) mentions Sraddhavivekamata. On the other hand, in the Rasayātrāviveka (which appears to be his last work) Sūlāpani mentions the Tirtha-cintāmani of Vacaspatimisra.1260 

At least thirteen Vivekas are known viz. Ekidasi, Tithi, Dattaka, Durgotsava, Dolayātrā, Pratisthā, Prayascitta, Rāsa yātra, Vratakāla, Suddhi, Sraddha, Saṅkranti, Sambandha. The Vratakālaviveka is published by Prof. S. C. Banerji in I. H. Q. Vol. 17 for 1941 ( appendix pp. 1-24, based on seven mss.). It mentions the Tithiviveka as already composed (p. 11) and also Pratișthāviveka (p. 24). He makes remarks on Vratas in general and then deals with individual vratas. It differs from the Vratatattva of Raghunandana (vol. 11. pp. 151–161 ) in that Raghunandana deals with the characteristics and rites of Vratas in general. For a short work (as the Vratakālaviveka is) Śūlapāṇi mentions a large number of authorities; many Purāṇas are relied upon as much as Smṛti works and writers. 

The Tithiviveka1261 of Śūlapāṇi was edited by Prof. of S. C. Banerji in P. O. Vol. VI. pp. 230-38, Vol. VII. pp. 8, 95-103. It is very brief, the text based on two mss. covering about 12 pages. It mentions that the Sraddhaviveka had been written before it. The object is to resolve the doubts caused by differ ent views in the authoritative works. Relying on two verses

of Devala (quoted below )1262 he appears to lay down the propo sitions that in a rite to be performed for worship of gods, find out whether the tithi required exists at sunrise (and it does not matter if it does not exist later ) and in rites in honour of pitss (manes ) find out the tithi that exists at sunset and per form the rite on it. Dr. J. B. Chaudhuri edited the Tithi viveka (Calcutta 1964) with the commentary called Tātparya dipikā by Srinātha-ācārya-cūdāmaṇi, son of mahamahopādhyāya Srikara and guru of Raghunandana Bhattācārya. 

A work called Caturangadipika’ (manual of fourhanded chess ) composed by Salapīni was edited by Mr. Mano Mohan Ghosh in 1936 with an Introduction, Sanskrit text (pp. 1-24), English tr. (32 pages ), Index of important words, proper names and general index (pp. 33-36). It is mentioned by Raghu nandana in (vol. I.) Tithitattva pp. 137-139. Vide Prof. S. K. Chatterji felicitation volume pp. 267-275 for Lexicographical notes on this work by Prof. E. D. Kulkarni. 

Four works of Sūlapāṇi are very famous viz. the Dipakalika, Prāyaścittaviveka, Durgotsavaviveka and the Srāddhaviveka. Unfortunately the last two works are not yet printed in Deva nāgari script. The Durgotsavaviveka has been published by the Sanskrit Sahitya Pariṣad of Calcutta in Bengali script and the Sraddhaviveka has similarly been published in the Bengali script by M. M. Candicarana Smistibhūsaṇa of Calcutta. 

Śūlapāṇi is mentioned with great respect by Raghunandana not only by the addition of titles like Mahamahopadhyāya but by referring to him in the plural as in (vol. I. Tithi p. 90, Prayas cittavivekakstām mate tu ) and in Vol. II. Ekadasi p. 15 (Prayas cittavivekakļdbhir-uktam ). 

Sūlapāṇi gives hardly any information about himself.1283 In the colophons of his works he is styled Mahamahopadhyaya 

1262 The two verses of Devala are : fi fatū fa914 3G* HIT

and also Sāhudiyān or Sāhudiyala or Sāhudiyā (in a ms. of the Dipakalikā). What this last means is not clear. It is possible that he came from some place called Sāhudi. There is hardly any reliable evidence to establish that the Sahudiya was a degraded section of the Radhiya brāhmaṇas in Bengal from the time of Ballalasena. I understand from Bengali friends that in these days also the surname Sāhudiyān is extant among the śrotriya brāhmaṇas of the Rādbiya group in Bengal. Raghunandana (a great Bengali writer ) often refers to im as Mahamahopadhyaya ( vide pp. 827-28 above ). 

There are several commentaries on the Sraddhaviveka such as those of (1) Srinātha-Åcāryacūdamani, son of Śrikara and Guru of Raghunandana; (2) Acyuta Cakravartin ; (3) Govinda nanda; (4) Śrikrýṇa (printed in Bengali type); (5) Nila kantha; (6) Jagadisa; (7) Ramakrsna. Some commentaries on the Prayascittaviveka also exist. Besides, the Tattavārtha kaumudi of Govindananda ( already referred to on p. 828 ) there is a commentary called Kaumudi or tippani by Rama krsna and another com. called Nigūdhārthaprakāśikā. 

As Sūlapāṇi names the Ratnakara of Candeśvara and Kala madhaviya, he must be later than about 1365 A. D., since some time must have elapsed before a work from Vijayanagara came to be regarded as an authority in Bengal. As Sulapāṇi's works 

(Continued from the previous page) Srinātha-Acāryacūdāmaṇi appears to be mentioned as Acar yacūlāmani along with other authors by Raghupandana in Vol. II. Yajurvedarṣotsargatattva p. 640. Raghunandana refers to his guru's views under the caption guru-carapāh' in a few places e. . vol. I. ( Tithi pp. 31, 85, Mala. p. 719. 815, Sariskāra p. 873 ); vol. II, Ekādaśī p. 103, Srivātha com posed several works and commentaries ending in the works

Rai Babadur Chakravarti furnishes a good account about his com mentaries and works in J. A. S. B. ( new series) Vol. XI. pp. 344-349. Śrinātha wrote two works on Śrāddha viz. Śrāddhacandrikā (Smṛtitattva, Vol. II. pp. 493 and 500) and Śrāddhadīpikā (Suartitattva, Vol. II. p. 488).

are mentioned by Rudradhara, Govindānanda and Vacaspati, the former must be earlier than about 1460. In this connection it has to be noted that Govindananda not only comments upon Śūlapāṇi's works but probably looks upon Sulapāṇi as an old writer along with Aniruddha,1263 

A ms. of the Prayascittaviveka was copied at Benares in sake 1410 (i. e. 1481 A. D. ).1264 Ms. No. 10849 of the Prayascitta viveka in the Baroda Oriental Institute's Library was copied in Vikrama year 1501 Māgha (i. e. about February 1445 A. D.). The post-colophon entry in that ms. is set out below.1265 From all these data it follows that Sūlapāṇi flourished between 1365 and 1445 A. D. 

Dr. Hazra in A. B. O. R. I. Vol. 32 (for 1951 ) in note on p. 46 says that Salapāṇi's Tithiviveka and Sraddhaviveka are mentioned by Rāyamukuṭa in the Smṛtiratnahāra which was composed before Rāyamukuta's commentary on the Amarakośa and that commentary was begun in 1431–32 A. D. But in I. H. Q. vol. 17 (pp. 456-471) it is pointed out by Prof. Dineshcandra Bhattacharya at p. 468 that the Țikā on the Amarakośa was composed in Sake 1396 i. e. 1447–75 A. D. and not in sake 1353 (which was mentioned incidentally in the ms. and was taken by Colebrooke and later scholars as the date of composition). Further contributions on the same subject appear in I. H. Q. vol. 18. pp. 215-224 against Prof. Bhattacharya, to which the latter replies in I. H. Q. vol. 19 pp. 182-190, to which Ahmed Hasan (the writer of the paper in I. H. Q. vol. 18 ) gives a rejoinder in I. H. Q. vol, 30 pp. 261-270. I cannot go here in these controversies. It has to be remembered that the fragment of Smstiratnākara refers to the Sraddhaviveka about three dozen of times. I agree with Prof. Bhattacharya's view. So even the dates proposed in the first edition (1375–1460

A. D.) for Salapāṇi were not altogether wide of the real date, In this edition an attempt has been made to advance somewhat more definite dates for Śūlapāṇi, that is all. 

It appears that Śūlapāṇi, Rudradhara and Vācaspati were more or less contemporaries of one another. Rudradhara men tions on p. 50 ( of his Śrāddhaviveka ) Gaudiya-Sraddhaviveka'.
