[[CHAPTER X MADHUPARKA AND OTHER USAGES|]]

## Madhuparka

Madhuparka: ([[ offering|offering ]] of honey by way of honour to [[a|a]] distinguished guest). The word literally means 'a ceremony in which honey is shed or poured' (on the hand of a person). The word occurs in the *Jaiminiya Upaniṣad-Brāhmaṇa* [^1253] I. 4. The *Nirukta* ( I. 16 ) also refers to the usage of offering madhuparka with the word madhuparka repeated thrice. It appears that the *Ait. Br.* III. 4 when it says that if the ruler of men comes as a guest or any one else deserving of honour comes, people kill a bull or a cow (that has contracted a habit of abortion)' refers to Madhuparka, [^1254] though that word is not actually used. In all [[gṛhyasūtras|gṛhyasūtras]] it is described at length. Most of the details are the same, the principal difference being that often different *mantras* are prescribed, though [[some|some]] ( like the verse '*mātā rudrāṇām*' ) are the same. The madhuparka [^1255] is offered to [[ṛtviks|ṛtviks]] (priests officiating at sacrifices ) when they are chosen for a sacrifice, to a *snātaka* who has come to one's house, to the king ( who rules one's country, when he comes to one's house ), to one's *ācārya*, father-in-law, paternal and maternal uncles. The *Mānava [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* (I. 9. 1), *Khādira [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* IV. 4. 21, *Vāj.* I. 110 say that six persons deserve *arghya* (madhuparka ) viz. [[ṛtvik|ṛtvik]], *ācārya*, the bride-groom, the king, the [[Snātaka|Snātaka]] and a person who is dear to one. Some like *Baud.* [^1256] I. 2. 65 add 'atithi' (guest ). Vide *Gaut.* V. 25, *Ap. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* 13. 19-20, *Ap. Dh. S.* II. 3. 8. 5-6, *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 8. 63-64,

[[P543]]

*Gobbila [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* IV, 10.23-24. It is laid down that if the persons enumerated come to one's house within a year after madhuparka has been [[once|once]] offered, then it need not be offered again ( in the same year), but when a marriage is being celebrated in one's house or a *yajña* is being performed, then madhuparka must be offered to those persons (even if one year has not elapsed since the madhuparka was previously offered). Vide *Gaut.* V. 26-27, *Ap. Dh. S.* II. 3. 8. 6, *Yāj.* I. 110, *Khādira [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* IV, 4. 26, *Gobbila [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* IV. 10. 26. *Ṛtviks* are to be honoured in each *yajña*, even though several *yajñas* are performed in the same year ( *Yāj.* I. 110). *Manu* (III. 120 ) says that a king and [[a|a]] *snātaka* are to be honoured with madhuparka only when they visit one's house in [[a|a]] *yajña*. *Viśvarūpa* ( on *Yāj.* I. 109 ) [[says|says]] that madhuparka is to be offered to the king only and not to any *kṣatriya*. *Medhātithi* on *Manu* III. 119 says that when [[a|a]] king, whether a *kṣatriya* or not, comes to one's place madhuparka was to be offered, but not to a *śūdra* king. According to [[gṛhya-pariśiṣṭa|gṛhya-pariśiṣṭa]] the madhuparka is to be [[performed|performed]] according to the rites prescribed in the [[śākhā|śākhā]] of the receiver and not of the giver. [^1257]

The procedure of madhuparka is set out from the *Aśv. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* [^1258] (I.24.5-26 ) " He pours honey into [[curds|curds]] or clarified butter if no honey can be had. A [[seat,|seat,]][^1259] water for [[washing|washing]] the feet, *arghya* water (i. e. water perfumed with flowers &c.), water for *ācamana*, honey mixture, a cow; every one of these they announce three times ( to the person who has arrived). The person (to be honoured ) should sit down on the seat made of northward pointed *darbha* grass with the verse [^1260] 'I am the highest one among my kindred, as the sun among lights' (lightnings ). Here I tread on whomsoever bears enmity to me.' Or he should repeat this verse after he has trodden on it. He should make ([[the|the]] host) wash his feet; the right foot he should

[[P544]]

hold out first to a *brāhmaṇa* ( for washing ) and the left to a *śūdra*. When [[his|his]] feet have been washed, he receives the *arghya* water in his joined hands and then he performs *ācamana* with the water for sipping with the formula 'thou art the seat (or first layer) of ambrosia ', [^1261] He should look at the madhuparka, when it is being brought to him, with the *mantra* 'I look at thee with the eye of *Mitra*'. He accepts it (the madhuparka) in the joined hands with the formula 'by the command (urging) of god *Savitṛ*, by the [[arms|arms]] of *Aśvins* and the hands of *Pūṣan*, I accept thee (*Vāj. S.* I. 24). He looks at it with the three *ṛk* verses [^1262] 'the winds blow honey to the righteous man' (*Ṛg.* I. 90. 6-8). He (takes it into his left hand ), stirs it about thrice from left to right with the thumb and the finger next to the smallest and wipes ( his fingers ) towards the east with the formula 'may the *Vasus* eat thee with the *Gāyatrī* metre'; with the formula 'may the *Rudras* eat thee with the *Triṣṭubh* metre' (he wipes fingers) towards the south; with the formula 'may the *Ādityas* eat thee with the *Jagatī* metre' towards the [[west|west]]; with the formula 'may *Viśve Devas* eat [[thee|thee]] with the *Anuṣṭubh* metre' towards the north; with the formula 'to the *bhūtas* ( beings ) thee' he three times takes (some of the madhuparka materials ) from out of the middle of it (and throws it up). He should partake of it for the first time with the formula [^1263] 'the milk of *Virāj* art thou ', for the second time with 'may I obtain the milk of *Virāj*', the third time with 'in me may the milk of *Pādya Virāj* dwell'. He should not eat the whole madhuparka and should not eat to satiety. He should give the remainder (out of the madhuparka materials ) to a *brāhmaṇa* towards the north; but if no *brāhmaṇa* is available he should throw it into water; or he may eat the whole. He then takes *ācamana* with the water intended for it with the

[[P545]]

formula 'thou art the cover of ambrosia,' [^1264] He sips water [[a|a]] second time with the formula "truth ! fame! fortune, may Fortune resort to me.' When he has sipped water, they announce to him the cow. Having muttered the words 'destroyed is my sin, my sin is destroyed', he says 'om, do it if he desires to have the cow killed; if he is desirous of letting her go, he mutters the [[verse|verse]] 'the mother of *Rudras* and daughter of *Vasus* ' [^1264A] (*Ṛg.* VIII. 101. 15 ) and says 'let her go'. Let the [[madhuparka|madhuparka]] not be without flesh."

A few small [[matters|matters]] may be noted. Several [[gṛhyasūtras|gṛhyasūtras]] (such as the *Mānava* ) describe madhuparka as a part of the marriage rite, while others like *Aśv.* describe it independently. Others like *Hir. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* (I. 12-13) describe it as part of *Samāvartana*. There is divergence about the substances mixed in offering madhuparka. *Aśv. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* and *Āp. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* (13. 10) [[prescribe|prescribe]] [[a|a]] mixture of honey and curds or clarified butter and curds. Others like *Pār. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* I. 3 [[prescribe|prescribe]] [[a|a]] mixture of three ([[curds|curds]], honey and butter ). *Ap. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* (13. 11-12 ) states the view of some that those three may be mixed or five (those three with fried *yava [[grain|grain]]* and barley ). *Hir. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* I. 12. 10-12 gives the option of mixing three or five (curds, honey, *ghee*, water and ground grain). The *Kausika sūtra* (92) speaks of nine kinds of mixtures viz, *Brāhma* (honey and [[curds|curds]]), *Aindra* ( of *pāyasa* ), *Saumya* (curds and *ghee*), *Pauṣpa* (*ghee* and *mantha*), *Sārasvata* (milk and *ghee*), *Mausala* ( wine and *ghee*, this being used only in *Sautrāmaṇī* and *Rājasūya* sacrifices), *Vāruṇa* (water and *ghee*), *Srāvaṇa* ( sesame oil and *ghee* ), *Pāriprājaka* (sesame oil and oil cake ). The *Mānava [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* I. 9. 22 says that the Veda declares that the madhuparka must not be without flesh and so it recommends that if the cow is let loose, goat's meat or *pāyasa* (rice cooked in milk) may be offered; the *Hir. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* I. 13. 14 says that other meat should be offered; *Baud. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]]* says (I. 2.51-54) that when the cow is let off, the flesh of a goat or ram may be offered or some forest flesh (of a deer &c.) may be offered, as there can be no madhuparka without flesh or if one is unable to offer flesh one may cook ground grains. As the cow became [[sacred|sacred]], it became unthinkable to kill her and so other flesh was

[[P546]]

offered. When even flesh-eating came to be abhorred, then only *pāyasa* and such other things were recommended. The *Adiparva* ( 60. 13-14) refers to [[Janamejaya's|Janamejaya's]] reception of [[Vyāsa|Vyāsa]] with madhuparka and [[Vyāsa's|Vyāsa's]] letting the cow [[loose|loose]]. This abhorrence of flesh-eating will be dealt with later on. In modern times there is generally no madhuparka except in marriage and then too it is a simple matter and the elaborate procedure [[prescribed|prescribed]] in some of the [[gṛhya|gṛhya]] *sūtras* is hardly ever followed.

Certain peculiar ceremonies relating to marriage may now be described very briefly. In order to avert early widowhood ( which was judged from her horoscope ) for the girl to be married, [[a|a]] ceremony called *kumbha-vivāha* was performed. It is described in *[[Saṃ.|Saṃ.]] Pr.* (p. 868 ), *Nirṇayasindhu* p. 310, *[[Saṃ.|Saṃ.]] K.* (p. 746), *S. R. M.* (p. 528 ) and other works. On the day previous to the marriage [[a|a]] jar of water in which [[a|a]] golden image of *Viṣṇu* is dipped is decked with flowers &c. and the girl is surrounded in a network of [[threads|threads]], *Varuṇa* and *Viṣṇu* are worshipped and prayed to give long life to the intended bride-groom. Then the jar is taken out and broken in [[a|a]] pool of water and then water is sprinkled over the girl with five twigs and to the accompaniment of *Ṛg.* VII. 49 and then *brāhmaṇas* are fed.

The *[[Saṃ.|Saṃ.]] Pr.* (pp. 868-869) speaks of *Aśvattha-vivāha* which is like *kumbha-vivāha* and performed for good [[luck|luck]] to the bride and averting widowhood. Here the *Aśvattha* tree is substituted for the jar and a golden image of *Viṣṇu* is worshipped. The image is then given to a *brāhmaṇa*.

*Arkavivāha*: When a man has the misfortune to lose by death two wives one after another, before marrying a third wife he goes through a ceremony of marriage with the *arka* plant. This is described in *[[Saṃ.|Saṃ.]] Pr.* pp. 876-889, *[[Saṃ.|Saṃ.]] K.* p. 819, *Nirṇayasindhu*, p. 328. It is described in *Baud. [[gṛ.|gṛ.]] [[śeṣasūtra|śeṣasūtra]]* V.5 also.

## Parivedana

Another question which takes up much space in ancient works but which is now of hardly any importance is *parivedana*. When a male got married before his elder brother or where a person married a younger girl before her elder sister was married, this act was called *parivedana* and was severely [[con.|con.]]demned as a serious encroachment on the rights of seniority and as [[a|a]] sin. *Gaut.* 15. 18 and *Ap. Dh. S.* (II. 5. 12. 22) declare that a younger brother married before an elder brother, and an elder

[[P547]]

brother married after a younger brother are sinners, and should not be invited at a *śrāddha*. *Ap.* adds that one who marries a younger sister before her elder sister is married, one who marries an elder sister after the younger sister has been married, one whose younger brother has kindled the sacred fires or offered a *soma* sacrifice before him (and a younger brother who kindles the sacred fires or offers *soma* sacrifice before his elder brother) are also equally sinful. *Vās. Dh. S.* I. 18, *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 37. 15-17 also have similar provisions and *Vās. Dh. S.* ( 20.7-10) [[prescribes|prescribes]] [[kṛcchra|kṛcchra]] penance of twenty days for the husband of the younger sister married before her elder sister and for the husband of the elder sister married after the younger one, requires each of them to offer his wife to the other for the sake of form (to remove the slur) and then to wed her again with his assent. [^1265] Vide *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 1. 40 also. The younger brother who marries before the elder brother is called *[[parivettā|parivettā]]* or *[[parivividāna|parivividāna]]* (*Manu* III, 171, *Ap. Dh. S.* II. 5. 12. 22) or *[[parivindaka|parivindaka]]* (*Yāj.* I. 223 ), the elder brother before whom the younger brother marries is called *[[parivitta|parivitta]]* or *[[parivinna|parivinna]]* or *[[pariritti|pariritti]]* (*Manu* III. 171 ), the younger sister who marries before the elder sister is called *[[agredidhiṣū|agredidhiṣū]]* (*Gaut.* 15. 15, *Vās.* I. 18) or *parivedini*, the elder sister before whom her younger sister marries is called *didhiṣī*. The [[husbands|husbands]] of these two last respectively bear the appellations *[[agredidhiṣūpati|agredidhiṣūpati]]* and *[[didhiṣūpati|didhiṣūpati]]*. The father or other guardian who gives away the girl in any of these cases of *parivedana* is called *[[paridāyī|paridāyī]]* or *[[paridātā|paridātā]]*. The younger brother who kindles the sacred fire before the elder is styled '[[paryādhātṛ|paryādhātṛ]]' and the elder brother who is so treated is called '[[paryāhita|paryāhita]]' (*Gaut.* 15. 18). *Manu* III. 172 ( which is almost the same as *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 1. 30 and *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 54. 16 ) says that the *parivettā*, the *parivitta*, the girl whom the younger brother marries before the elder, the man who gives away the girl in marriage and the officiating priest-these [[five|five]] all fall into [[hell|hell]][^1266] (and must perform the penance of *[[Cāndrāyaṇa|Cāndrāyaṇa]]* according to *Viṣṇu* ). The *Mit.* on

[[P548]]

*Yāj.* III. 265 quotes *Hārita-dharmasūtra* on this topic to the same effect. *Medhātithi* on *Manu* III. 171 refers to the view of some that if a son kindles the sacred fire before his father, the same rule applies as between brothers and then refutes that view. *Aparārka* p. 446 quotes *Uśanas* that [[a|a]] person may kindle sacred fires even before his father or grandfather with the latter's consent. The *[[Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana|Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana]]* ( I. 76-77 ) says that there is no sin in taking *agnihotra* and performing a sacrifice before an elder brother and the incurring of sin is only restricted to marriage, while the *[[Smṛtyarthasāra|Smṛtyarthasāra]]* (p. 13 ) holds the opposite view that one should not kindle the Vedic fires before one's father even with the latter's consent. The *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* ( 37. 15-17 ) enumerates *parivedana* among *upapātakas*. *Gaut.* ( 18. 18-19 ) prescribes that if an elder brother has gone to a foreign country his younger brother must wait twelve years before he takes a wife or kindles sacred fires or six years according to some. [^1267] There is a similar text of *Vās.* quoted by *Aparārka* p. 445.

In certain cases marrying or kindling sacred fires before an elder brother is not condemned. *Medhātithi* on *Manu* III. 171 quotes a verse 'One need not wait where the elder brother is a lunatic, or is a sinner, or leprous, impotent, or suffering from [[tuberculosis|tuberculosis]]' and remarks that this is only illustrative (i. e. one need not wait where the elder brother has no *adhikāra* for marriage or for kindling fires) [^1268] Vide *Atri* v. 105 ( Anan. ed.) for a similar verse. Another [[verse|verse]] of *Atri* (v. 106 ) says that there is no blemish in marrying before the elder brother, if the latter is impotent or gone abroad, or *palita* or has become a [[recluse|recluse]] or is devoted to *[[Yogaśāstra|Yogaśāstra]]* [^1269]. Vide *Gobhila [[Smṛti|Smṛti]]* (I. 72-74) for similar verses ( which are quoted by the *Gṛ. R.* p. 90), *[[Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana|Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana]]* I. 68–74, *[[Smṛtyarthasāra|Smṛtyarthasāra]]* p. 13 and *[[Saṃ.|Saṃ.]] Pr.* pp. 760-766.

The ideas about the wrong committed by a younger brother or sister marrying before an elder one reach far back into Vedic antiquity. In the *Tai. Br.* (III. 2. 9) there is a story that the gods transferred (rubbed off) their sin to the *Apyas* and then

[[P549]]

there is a succession of persons who are all guilty of blame or sin and each preceding one among whom is said to have passed it on to each succeeding one viz. *[[sūryābhyudita|sūryābhyudita]]*, *[[sūryābhinimrukta|sūryābhinimrukta]]*, *[[kunakhin|kunakhin]]*, *[[śyāvadat|śyāvadat]]*, *[[agredidhiṣū|agredidhiṣū]]*, *[[parivitta|parivitta]]*, *[[vīrahan|vīrahan]]*, *[[brahmahan|brahmahan]]*. The *Vās. Dh.*[^1270] S. I. 18 arranges persons called sinners (*enasvin*) almost in the same order as in the *Tai. Br.* Here (in *Tai. Br.*) we have *parivitta* and *agredidhiṣū*. In another passage of the *Tai. Br.* (III. 4. 4) while speaking of *[[Puruṣamedha|Puruṣamedha]]*, it is said that the *parivitta* is consigned as a victim to ill-luck (*[[niraṣṭi|niraṣṭi]]*), the *[[parivividāna|parivividāna]]* to distress (*ārti*) [[and|and]] the *[[didhiṣūpati|didhiṣūpati]]* to non-success (*aruddhi*).

They occur in [[Vāj. S. 13. 27-29|Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā 13. 27-29]], are called Madhumatī verses and employed in [[Āśv. Gṛ. I. 3|Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Sūtra I. 3]], also in [[Śānkh. Gṛ.
