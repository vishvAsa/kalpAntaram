CHAPTER XII 

THE DUTIES OF A WIDOW, SOME PRIVILEGES 

OF WOMEN AND THE PURDA SYSTEM 

Vidhavādharmaḥ So far the social position and the duties and rights of a wife during her husband's life-time have been considered. We shall now consider the rules laid down for a wife if she has the heavy misfortune to become a widow. 1361 

The word vidhavā occurs several times in the Rgveda (.8. IV. 18. 12, X. 18.7, X. 40.2 and 8); but these passages contain very little that is indicative of their condition in society except Rs. X. 40.2 (vide under niyoga). Rg. I. 87, 3 1364 says in the rapid movements of the Maruts the earth trembles like a woman deprived of her husband,' That shows that widows trembled either from sorrow or from fear of molestation and ill-treatment. 

The Baud. Dh, S. 1363 II. 2. 66-68 prescribes that the widow of the departed should give up for one year honey, meat, wine and salt and should sleep on the ground; according to Maud. galya (she should so act) for six months; after that period, if she is Bonless, she may procreate & son from her brother in-law if the elders consent.' Vas. Dh. 8. (17. 55-56 ) contains similar provisions. Manu (V. 157-160 ) contains rules that have been repeated in almost all smrtis 'a woman when her husband is dead, may, if she chooses, emaciate her body by subsisting on flowers, roots and fruits, but she should not even take the name of a stranger male. Till her death she should be forbearing, observe vows, should be celibate and should hanker after that super-eminent code of conduct that is presoribed for women devoted to their husbands. On her husband's death, if a virtuous woman abides by the rule of celibaoy, she goes to heaven though she be sonless, as the ancient perpetual

students (like Sanaka ) did. Kātyāyana 1364 similarly provides ' a gonless widow preserving the bed of her husband ( unsullied ) and residing with her elders and being self-controlled (or forbearing ) should enjoy her husband's property till her death; after her the heirs of her husband would get it. A widow engrossed in religious observances and fasts, abiding by the vow of celibacy, always bent on restraining her senses and making gifts would go to heaven oven though sonless,' Parāsara IV. 31 is almost the same as Manu V. 160. Brhaspati 1365 says *the wife is declared to be half of a man's body, she participates equally in the husband's merit and sin; & virtuous wife, whether she burns herself on her husband's funeral fire or lives after bim, tends to the spiritual) benefit of her husband'. Výddha-Hārlta (XI. 205-210) prescribes what a widow should do all her life, 'She should give up adorning her hair, chewing betel-nut, wearing perfumes, flowers, ornaments and dyed olothes, taking food from a vessel of bronze, taking two meals a day, applying collyrium to her eyes; she should wear a white garment, should curb her senses and anger, she should not resort to deceits and tricks, should be free from laziness and sleep, should be pure and of good conduct, should always worship Hari, should sleep on the ground at night on a mat of kusa grass, she should be intent on concentration of mind and on the company of the good.' Bāṇa in his Harṣacarita ( VI, last para ) indicates that widows did not apply eye-galve to their eyes nor rocana (yellow pigment) to their face and simply tied their hair.1386 Pracetas 1367 forbids to an ascetic and a widow the chewing of betel leaves, ceremonial bath (with oil &c.) and taking meal in a vessel of bell-metal. The Adiparva (160, 12) says just as birds flock to a piece of flesh left on the ground, so all men woo (or try to seduce ) a woman whose

husband is dead': while the Santiparva (148. ) remarks 'all widows are in sorrow even if they have many sons. 1368 The Skandapurana (Kasikhanda, chap. 4, vv. 71-106 and III Brahmaranya section ohap. 7, vv. 67-81) has long passages on the duties of widows, many verses from which ara quoted in the Madanaparijata (pp. 202-203), the Nirnayasindhu, Dharma sindhu and other nibandbas. A few striking verses may be translated here. The Skandapurāṇa (III, Brahmaranya seotion chap. 7, verses 50-51) says 'The widow is more inauspicious than all other inauspicious things; at the sight of a widow no success oan be had in any undertaking ; excepting one's ( widowed) mother all widows are void of auspiciousness%3 & wise man should avoid even their blessings like the poison of a snake 1809. The Kāśikhanda of the game purāṇa, chap. 4, delivers itself thus the tying up into a braid of the hair by the widow leads to the bondage of the husband; therefore a widow should always abave her head. She should always take one meal a day and never & second; or she may perform the observance of fast for a month or undergo the penance of cāndrā yaṇa. A widow who sleeps on & cot would make her husband fall (in hell). A widow should never wash her body with fragrant unguents nor should enjoy the fragrance of sweet smelling things; she should everyday perform tarpana with sesame, water and kusa grass for her husband, his father and grandfather after repeating their names and gotra; she should not sit in & bullock cart even when about to die, she should not put on a bodice, should not wear dyed garments and should observe special vows in Vaisakha, Kartikaro and Māgha.'.

Kāśikhanda 4.74) is the only verse on wbich the medieval writers rely for prescribing continual tonsure of widows. That ohapter begins by extolling the pativratā ( Bphaspati does it with regard to Lopamudrā, the wife of Agastya). It passes one's under standing why when a pativratā whose husband is living is before Bphaspati he should wax eloquent over the duties of widows ( verses 71-106 ). Therefore this portion appears to be an interpolation in the Skandapurāṇa itself. In Lakshmibai v. Ramchandra I. L. R. 22 Bom. 590, it was held that the text 'vidhara-kabarl-bandho' is of doubtful validity (p. 594 ). Besides 69 verses of this chapter 4 are common to chap. 7 of the Dharmāranya section of the Skandapurāṇa ( III ) which precedes it. There is no reason why they should have been repeated. The Nirnayasindhu quotes & passage from the Brabmapurāṇa as cited in the Pșthvioandrodaya to the effeot that sraddha food should not be got prepared by a widow belonging to another gotra.!?? 

The position of the Hindu widow was miserable and her lot was most unenviable. She was looked upon as inauspicious and so could take part in no festivities, such as those on marriage. She had not only to lead a life of perfeot celibacy, even if she was a child widow, but she had to act like an ascetic, being poorly fed (only once a day) and poorly olad. Her rights to property were negligible. Even if the husband died sonless she did not originally succeed as shown above (p. 582). Later on her position as an beir was improved; but even then she could ordinarily enjoy only the income of the pro perty and could transfer it only for the legal necessities of the family ( including herself) or for the spiritual benefit of her husband. In a joint Hindu family a widow had only the right of maintenance ( except in Bongal where she had more rights ), which would be forfeited if she became unohaste and persisted in that course. 1378 If she returned to a moral life then she may be entitled to bare starving maintenance (vide above p. 573 ). If her husband had separate property and left a son or sons, the widow was only entitled to maintenance. This was the law

The Duties of a widow

One subject that arouses bitter controversies is the practice of tonsuring widows among brāhmaṇas and certain other castes. A few words must be said on this. It is clear from the verso (vidhavā-kabari.bandho &c.) of the Skandapurāṇa quoted in the Madanapārijāta and other nibandhas that for some time at least before the 14th century A. D. (when the Madanapārijāta was composed) tonsure of widows was in yogue. How and exactly when this practice arose cannot be established with certainty. That it is comparatively & later innovation can, however, be demonstrated. Two distinct propositions have to be made out, first, that widows were tonsured on the death of their husbands, just as sons were tonsured and secondly, that widows were required by the texts to tonsure themselves continually from time to time till their death, though sons who had to tonsure themselves on their father's death are not required to do so after wards. Tbe advocates of this practice rely upon three Vedic passages, viz. Rg. X. 40.2, Ap. M. Pātha I. 4. 9, and Atharvaveda 14.2. 60, Rg. X. 40, 2 ( cited below p. 606 ) refers to vidhavā only and probably to niyoga, but there is nothing about tonsure in that Verse. Some modern orthodox Pandita ingeniously argue from the explanation of the word 'vidhava' in the Nirukta (IIL 15 vidh.. vanād-vā iti Carmaśirāḥ). Carmaśiras is the name of a former teacher according to all commentators of the Nirukte, but these pandits interpret it by a tour de force as & synonym of vidhavi ('having only the bare skin on her head'). About this interpretation the less said the better. Ap.M.P. 1.5.9 contains the word 'vikesil which is translated as the appellation of a female goblin in S. B. E. vol. 30 p. 187 'mayst thou not be beaten at thy breast by she goblin, the rough haired 1378 one'. Even taking 'vikesi As referring to the maiden who is being married the meaning is 'mayst thou, with dishevelled hair, not beat thy breast ( through grief )'. The word 'vikesi' does not mean 'a widow whose hair is tonsured'; it ordinarily means' & woman

with dishevelled hair'. The third passage is Atharvaveda 1376 14. 2. 60, that is a verse in a marriage hymn which means ' if this daugbter of thine has bewailed with loosened hair in thy house, doing evil by her wailing, from that sin let Agni and Savitr release thes'. Here it is impossible to hold that' vikesi' means tonsured, as this mantra is part of the marriage hymn and Agni is asked to remove the blemish due to the girl's weeping at the approaching prospect of separation from her parents. There is no comment of Sāyaṇa on this passage but elsewhere in the Atharvaveda when that word oocurs as in Atharva XI. 9. 14 he paraphrases it by 'vikirṇakesi' which does not mean 'with tonsured hair' but only 'baving dishevelled hair'. Therefore there is no reference whatever to the tonsure of widows in the Veda, much less an inju notion as to it. In the Baud. Pitṛmedhasūtra, 1375 elaborate rules are laid down about the cremation of one who had kindled the sacred Vedic fires. In I. 4. 3 it is said his wives led by the youngest should follow the cortege with dishevelled hair and throwing dust on their shoulders' and this they have to repeat several times ( vide I. 4. 12-13, 1. 5, 5-7, I. 5. 12-14) on the way to the cemetery. It is also said that they go round the corpse) thrice with their hair gathered togetber (I. 4. 13). Then in I. 12. 7 shaving of the hair and moustache is prescribed for the close relatives of the deceased ( amātyas ) who are present, his wives are not mentioned in this connection and II. 3. 17 expressly forbids tonsure of wives. 

Manu and Yāj, dilate on the duties of widowe, but they are entirely silent about tonsure. Nor does any other ancient smrti refer to it. On the contrary Vśddha-Hārita (XI. 206 quoted above p. 584 ) asks the widow not to deck her hair, among other things which, she is not to do. This makes it clear that the widows kept their hair. The word 'keśarañjanam' is to be dissolved as 'kesanām rañjanam' and not as 'kesasoa rañjanam 08' ( as Vžddha-Harita XI. 103 makes it clear by employing 'kegānāṁ raśjanartham vā). It can be shown that

The tonsure of widows 

589 

at least kṣatriya widows never tonsured their head. In the Mahābhārata whenever the widows of the fallen warriors are described they are always referred to as 'having dishevelled hair' and there is not a single reference to tonsure 1378 of widows. In the Harṣacarita, Harga 1377 in his soliloquy on the death of his father Prabhākaravardhana says 'may the Glory of super-eminent man-hood tie up her hair in the way in :which widows tie up their hair'. In the Pehoa praśasti of king Mahendrapala of Kanoj (E. I. vol. 1. p. 246 verse 16) the widows of his enemies are spoken of as shedding tears on their cheeks and having long ( not braided) and profuse 1378 tresses. 

The orthodox pandits rely on a verse in Vedavyasa-smṛti 1379 II. 53 'a brāhmaṇa woman should enter fire, clasping the dead body of her husband; if she lives ( does not become sali ) she being tyaktakesā should emaciate her body by tapas'. The read. ing brāhmaṇi' for 'jivanti' is not good, as the word 'brāhmaṇl' is redundant having occurred in the first half and as the second half refers to the faot of her surviving after her husband. In this verse the injunction relates only to the emaciation of the body ( śoṣayet ), the word 'tyaktakeśa' being only an attribute of the subject is no part of the predicate, which alone is enjoined. The general rule laid down by the Mimāṁsā is (III. 1. 13-15, the grahaikatvanyāya) | 380 that the attributes of a subject are no part

The Pandito try to apply the rules in Jaimnini III. 8. 34-46, but those rules are inapplicablo, since in the passage of Veda-Vyasa there is . vorb in the potential mood, while in the vodio sentence interpreted in Jaimini III. 3. 34-46 there is no verb in the potential mood,

History of Dharmasastra (Ch. XII of the injunction. There is no injunction about keśa ( hair ) in the Vedavyāsa passage. Besides the word tyaktakesā ( who has given up hair) may possibly be made to yield three meanings, viz. (1) one who has given up or is unmindful of dressing or decking her hair, (2) one whose hair is given up in accordance with the prescription of some smṛtis that only two finger-breadths of tresses are to be cut off when doing penance for govadba &c. in the case of women (vide Parāśara IX. 54-55, Angiras 163, Yama 54 ); (3) one whose head is tonsured. For the first meaning vide Raghuvamāa IX. 14 ( where 'analakām' is explained by Mallinātha as' who have given up ornamenting the hair'). For this meaning of 'tyakta' vide Bhagavadgitā I. 33' tyaktajivitāḥ'. 'Tyakta ' by itself never means tonsured. The third meaning will be only implied if at all, while the first two are the usual meanings. Further, the interpretation of the Veda-Vyāsa smrti II. 53 given by the pandits is liable to the fault called vākyabheda (i. 8. it lays down two injunctions in one and the same sentence ), as they say that Veda-Vyasa calls upon widows to tongure themselves and to emaciate their body. Besides, if Veda-Vyasa really meant to enjoin tonsure, the verge could easily have been made to read 'jivanti ced vapet kesān tapasā &o.' Lastly assuming that Veda-Vyāga refers to tonsure, there is conflict among smptis, since Vrddha-Harita ( quoted above ) allows her to keep her hair, and since an option results when two texts of equal authority conflict ( Gaut. I. 5). 1381 

The Mit. on Yāj. III. 325 quotes a text of Manu (not found in the printed Manu) shaving of the hair is not desired in the case of learned men, the king and women, except in the case of one guilty of mahāpātaks or the killer of a cow and a brahma. carl guilty of sexual intercourse. 1889 The Mit. nowhere refers to tonsure as one of the obligatory matters for widows. 

The orthodox pandits further rely upon Ap. Dh. 8. I. 3.10.6, its explanation in the Mit. on Yāj. III. 17 and the explanation of the Mit, in the commentary, Balambhatti. Apastamba's kūtra is delivered when the context is about cessation of Veda study (anadhyāya). Āp. gays '( the student) shall cease studying Veda for 12 days if his mother, father or teacher dies.

case of the death of these he must also bathe for the same number of days. Persons who are younger than (the relation deceased) must shave their hair. 1383 Some declare that students who have returned home on completion of brahmacarya sball never shave except when engaged in a frauta sacrifice. In sattras even the top-lock must be shaved'. In this there is no reference to women, much less to widows and lesser still to the tonsure of widows. The reference to srauta sacrifices, sattra, and-sikha indicates that only males are in view. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 17 explains at length Ap. Dh, S. I. 3. 10. 6. It gives two Benses of 'anubhavin' viz. those who experience sorrow on the death of a person i. e. his gapiṇdas ( from the root 'bhủ' with 'anu,' to experience) and those who are born after the deceased i. e. who are younger than the deceased (from 'bhu' with 'anu 'to be born after). The Mit. then combines 1384 these and remarks 'those sapindas of the deceased who are younger than the latter have to save themselves on the death of a relative'. This is its own view. It then refers to the view of some that 'anubhāvin' In Ap. means 'son' and those latter rely on a restrictive text * shaving is declared on seven occasions only, vix. on the Ganges, in the Bhaskara-kṣetra, on the death of one's parents or teacher, at the time of consecrating srauta fires, and at the time of a soma sacrifice'. It is clear that the Mit. does not expressly mention the wife or widow here. Supposing that she is impliedly referred to as & sapiṇda and as younger than her husband, this will at the most come to the requirement that on the death of the husband the wife had to undergo shaving, just as her son would have to do. But this passage cannot be used to support continual shaving of widows throughout life. Really 'anubhāvinām' in Ap. cannot include the wife; since if women were to be included by the rule of ekaśega ( vide Panini I. 2. 67 ) the absurd conclusion would follow that the daughters of the deceased and his younger brother's wives (who are all sapiṇdas and younger) would have

to be shaved. The Nirnayasindhu 1388 ( composed in 1612 A. D.) and the Bālambhatti ( composed towards the end of the 18th century ) were both familiar with the tonsure of widows and so they interpret Ap. and the Mit. as requiring shaving for the wife on the 10th day after the death of the husband and rely on a text of Vyāsa quoted in Aparārka. The Balambhatti says "the words on the death of the mother and father' are only illustra tive and so the same rule applies to the husband's death." Even conceding all this far-fetched interpretation, there is no authority for the continual tonsure of widows tbronghout their lives in these passages. It may be noted that the Madana pārijāta 1386 which contains the verse (vidbavā-kabarl-bandho &o. quoted above ) does not include the widow among 'anubha vinām', but only male sapiṇdas and sons. 

The foregoing discussion leads to the following conclusions. There is no express Vedic authority for the tonsure of widows. The grhya or dharma sūtras do not refer to it; nor do important smstis like those of Manu and Yāj. If one or two smrti verses of doubtful import seem to refer to it, other smrtis. Like Vžddha-Harita are to an opposite effect. Some of the smrti texts only refer, if at all, to one shaving on the husband's death, but there is no smrti passage prescribing continual shaving for widows. There is only the Skandapurāṇa passage expressly requiring tonsure of widows. The Mit. and Aparārks are silent about it. It appears that the practice Was gradually evolved after the 10th or 11th century. As widows were equated with yatis for several injunctions ( vide note 1367 above ) and as the latter shaved themselves, widows were gradually required to do so. By rendering them ugly it might have been intended to keep them ohaste. Probably the example of Buddhist and Jaina nuns may have also suggested the cruel practice. We find from the Oullavagga 1387 that Buddhist nuns

cut off their hair and put on orange-coloured robes. In Maha rāṣtra brāhmaṇa widows a few years ago wore a garment that wag reddish ( and even now a few old widows do wear it). At all events the practice is not very old and hardly any digest before the Madanapārijāta ( 14th century ) quotes the Skanda. purāṇa text. The practice is dying out and deserves to be suppressed at once, though strange insistence on it sometimes obtains publio notoriety. Recently the worshippers in the famous shrine of Vithobā at Pandharpur in Mahārāṣtra pre yented an untonsured brāhmaṇa widow from baving darśana of the idol in the customary way i. e, by placing the head on the feet of the idol, while they were prepared to allow untongured widows of all castes ( except the so called untouchables ), and even Hindu prostitutes in the keeping of Christians or Maho medans to have darśana in that way. The matter came before a civil court, where it was decided in favour of the widow that no such disorimination could be allowed to pravail, but owing to certain unforeseen circumstances the case did not come before the Bombay High Court, 

It would be of interest to many to learn that among one sect ( the Tengalai) of the Sri-vaiṣnavas ( followers of Rāmā. nuja ) tonsure of widows has been forbidden for centuries, though tbat sect is most orthodox in other matters. 1388 The Śūdrakamalakara romarks that widows in Gouda keep their hair. 1989 

From very ancient times, it appears the idea was that women should not be killed on any account. The Sat. Br. ( XI. 4. 3. 2, S. B. E. vol. 44, p. 62 ) says 1390 people do not kill a woman, but rather take (anything ) from her (leaving her ) alive'. It was only the king who was authorised, according to Viśvarūpa, to punish a woman to death for adultery with a inan of very low caste ( vide Gaut, and Manu VIII. 371 quoted above on p. 572 ), but the king had to undergo a slight penance for doing this ( vide Yāj. III, 268). Manu XI. 190 ordains that one who killed a woman was not to be associated with, even after he performed the requisite ponance. Manu IX. 232 calls

upon the king to punish with death those who murder women, children and brahmaṇas. The Mahabhārata frequently refers to this chivalrous rule. Adiparva 1391 158. 31 says 'those who know dharma declare that women are not to be killed'. The Sabhāparya 41. 13 prescribes 'one's weapons should not be directed against women, cows, brāhmaṇas, against one who gave livelihood or shelter'. In the Santiparva (135. 14 ) even thieves are instructed not to kill women. Vide also Ādi. 153, 2, 217. 4, Vanaparva 206. 46. The Rāmāyaṇa ( Balakānda ) also breathes this sentiment, when Rāma was called upon to kill the ogress Tataka. 

Even for the most serious offence of adultery with a man of a low caste Yaj. II. 286 prescribes for the woman the punish ment of cutting the ear &c. Similarly Vṛddha-Hārsta VII. 192 

prescribes the cutting of the nose, ear and lip for attempt to 'murder the husband or her foetus. Vide Yaj. II. 278-279 for the sentence of death in the case of women for certain offences. 

It has been seen how women gradually lost the privilege of upanayana, of studyiog the Veda, of having all the samskāras performed with Vedic mantras and how they came to be regarded as entirely dependent on men. Their position became assimilated to that of the sūdras 1392 in many matters. A few examples will be cited here. All dvijātis were to sip water thrice (acamana) for purifying their body, but women and sūdras were to sip water only once for that purpose ( Manu V. 139, Yāj. I. 21). The dvijātis were 1393 to take their bath to the accompaniment of Vedic mantras, while women and sūdras were to bathe silently. Sūdras and women were to perform what is called amaśrāddba (i. e. śrāddba without cooked food).1394 The same penance was prescribed for killing a sūdra or a woman ( Baud. Dh. 8. II. 1. 11-12, Parāśara VI. 16). Ordinarily women, children and very old men could not be witnesses ( Yaj.

II. 70, Nārada, rnādāna, vv. 178, 190, 191 ), but Manu VIII. 68, 70, Yāj. II. 72, and Nārada, rṇādāna 155 allowed women to be witnesses in disputes between women or when no other witness could be had or in the cases of theft, adultery and other offences in which force was an element. Documents taken from or transactions ( partioularly gift, sale and mortgage of lands or houses ) made with women were ordinarily to be treated as voidable like those brought about by force or fraud (vide Nārada, ļṇādana 26, 137, Yāj, II. 31). But this instead of being regarded as a disability was rather a boon owing to the general illiteracy of women. The Tristhalssetu (of Nārāyana ) quotes a passage of the Brhan-Nāradiya purāṇa to the effect that women, those whose upanayana has not been performed and sūdras bave no right to establish the images of Viṣṇu or Śiva. 1395 

If there were many and heavy disabilities on women in certain matters, they enjoyed in certain directions more privi. leges than men. It has been already seen that women were not to be killed nor were they to be abandoned even when guilty of adultery. They also enjoyed the right of precedence on the road (vide p. 146 above). The daughter 1386 of a patita was not regarded as palita, though the son of a patita was regarded as patita ( vide Vas. 13. 51-53, Ap. Dh. S. II. 6. 13, 4, Yaj. III. 261). Women 1887 had to undergo only half of the prāyascitta that men had to undergo for the same lapse (Viṣṇu Dh. 8. 54. 33, Devala 30, &o). Women received 1398 honour according to the ages of their husbands, whatever their own ages may be (Ap. Dh. S. I. 4. 14. 18). Just as brābmaṇas learned in the Vedas were to be free from taxes, the women of all varṇas (except those of pratiloma castes ) had to pay no taxes, 1999 according to Āp. Dh.

(Ch. XII 

S. II. 10. 26. 10-11). Vas. D5, S. 19. 23 limits this exemption to women who are young or just delivered of a child. Pregnant women from the third month of pregnancy, forest hermits, samnyāsins and brahmaṇas and brahmacārins had to pay no tax at a ferry (Manu VIII. 407 and Viṣṇu V. 132 ). According to Gaut. V, 23 and Yāj. 1. 105 children, the daughters and sisters who are married and yet stay with their parents or brothers, pregnant women, unmarried daughters, guests and servants are to be fed before the master and mistress of the house; wbile Manu III. 114 and Viṣṇu Dh, S. 67. 39 go a step further and say that freshly married girls of the fanily, unmarried girls, pregnant women are to be fed even before guests. A judicial proceeding in which a woman was a party, or which was heard at night or outside the village or inside a house (i. e. not in public) or before enoinies was liable to be reviewed (Nārada 1:00 I. 43). Ordinarily trial by ordeal did not apply to a woman, whether she was plaintiff or defendant, but if at all a woman had to prove her case by ordeal, only the ordeal of tulā ( balance ) was prescribed for her (Yaj. 11, 98 and Mit. thereon ). In succession to strīdhana property, daughters were preferred to sons. Women did not lose their stridhana by adverse possossion ( Yāj. II. 25, Nārada, ṣṇādāna 82-83). Women were always to be consulted about ācāra, Ap. Dh, S, II. 11. 29. 15 cites the view that rules not stated in the sūtra are, according to some teachers, to be understood from women and from men of all castes. Āp. gr. II. 15 prescribes that in marriage the usages to be followed are to be learnt from women. Vide also Asv. gr. I. 14. 8, Manu II. 223, Vaik, III. 21. 1401 

One interesting question is whether the practice of purda now in vogue among Moslems and also among Hindus in certain provinces of India prevailed in anoient times. Rg. X, 85, 33 (used in the marriage rite) expressly calls upon people to look at the bride. "This bride is endowed with great auspicious ness; assemble together and see her; having given her bless ings of good luck you may go to your house'. The Asv. gr. I. 8. 7 prescribes that at each halting place when the bride-groom is returning to his village with his bride he should

look at the spectators with the verge Rg. X. 85. 33. 1408 This shows that no veil was worn by the bride and she appeared in public without one. Though in the marriage hymn there is a blessing (Rg. X. 85.46) that the bride was to dominate over her father-in-law, mother-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law, it appears that that was only a blessing and the heart's wish, but the reality was somewhat different. The Ait. Br. 1408 (12. 11) gays that the daughter-in-law is abashed in the presence of the father-in-law and goes away concealing herself from him. This indicates that there was some restraint for younger women when they were in the presence of elders. But in the gļhya and dharma sūtras there is no reference to any veil for women when moving in public. Pāṇini III. 2. 36 teaches the formation of 'asūryampaśyā' (who do not see the sun) applied to queens. That only shows that royal ladies did not leave the precincts of the palace and come under publio gaze. In the Ayodhya-kāṇda 1404 ( 33. 8) it is said ' people walking on the publio road see to-day Sitā who could not formerly be seen even by aerial beings'. Similarly it is stated in the same kāṇda ( 116.28) 'the appearance of a woman in publio is not blamable in misfortunes, diffioulties, in wars, in svayamvara, in & sacrifice, and in a marriage'. In the Sabhāparva 1405 69.9 Draupadi exolaims 'we have heard that ancient people did not take married women to the public assembly-hall; that ancient and long-standing practice has been contravened by the Kauravas' She says this after referring to the fact that, since she was seen at her svayamvara by the kings, she was never seen again by them till the day she

was brought to the assembly-hall when Yudhisthira gambled and lost everything. This shows that women, particularly high born ladies, did not appear in public except on certain occasions, but it does not follow that they always wore the veil. When the Kauravas were routed the Salyaparva ( 29.74 ) laments that their ladies whom even the sun did not see in their palaces were seen by the common people who had come to the capital. Vide also Sabhāparva 97. 4-7, Salyaparva 19. 63, StrIparva 9. 9-10, Aśrama-vāsi-parva 15. 13. In the Harṣacarita (IV) princess Rājyasri, whom the intended bride-groom Grahavarmā came to see just before marriage, is described as having her face covered with a veil of fine red cloth. In another place, while describing the country of Sthāṇvisvara ( modern Thanesar) Bāṇa says "where bees drawn by the fragrance of the breaths of the ladies (and hovering round their faces ) served as a charming veil for their faces and the veil actually worn by them became a mere redundancy worn because it was the practice of high-born ladies to wear one'. In the Kādambari also (para 99 ) Bāṇa describes Patralekha as covering her face with a veil of red cloth. In the sakuntala 1406 when Sakuntalā is taken to the court of Duṣyanta she is described as wearing & veil. So it must be conceded that ladies of high rank did not appear in public without a veil, but ordinarily women did not wear any veil. It is probably after the advent of the Moslems that the wearing of a veil, which was not quite unknown, became general among Hindu women in Northern and Eastern India. Vide Indian Antiquary for 1933 p. 15, where & passage is quoted from the Saṅkhyatattva-kaumudi of Vacaspati ( 9th century A. D.) referring to ladies of good family not appearing in public without a veil and Pathak Commemoration vol. p. 72 for references from Buddhist works about the practice of purda.
