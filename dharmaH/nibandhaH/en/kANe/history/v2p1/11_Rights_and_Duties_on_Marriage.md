[[CHAPTER XI POLYGAMY, POLYANDRY AND RIGHTS & AND DUTIES ON MARRIAGE|]]

## Polygamy

Polygamy: Though monogamy [[127seems|seems]] to have been the ideal and was probably the rule, the Vedic literature is full of references to polygamy. *Ṛg.* X. 145 (same as *Atharvaveda* III. 18) is a hymn meant as a charm for [[weaning|weaning]] the husband's affections from a co-wife. It occurs in the *Ap. M. P.* (I. 15 ) and *Āp. Gṛ.* IX. 6-8 prescribes it for winning over the husband to oneself and for causing estrangement between him and one's co-wife. *Ṛg.* X. [[1878 159|159]] is a hymn attributed to *Śacī*, wife of *Indra*, who claims to have vanquished and killed her co-wives and to rule supreme over *Indra* and all men. This hymn also occurs in *Āp. M. P.* (I. 16 ) and is prescribed by the *Ap. Gṛ.* (IX. 9) as a charm always to be repeated by a wife for suppressing [[her|her]] co-wives. In [[a|a]] verse (*Ṛg.* I. 105. 8) *Trita* who had fallen into a well declares 'the rib-like sides of the well) cause me pain all round as co-wives make it too hot ( for the husband or for themselves )'. [^1273] [[1872The|The]] *Tai. S.* (VI. 6. 4.3) gives a dogmatic and somewhat picturesque explanation of polygamy that 'on one sacrificial post he passes round two girdles, so one man secures two wives; that he does not pass one girdle round two posts, so one wife does not obtain two husbands'. The *Ait. Br.* (12. 11 ) similarly declares 'therefore one man [[has|has]] many wives, but one wife has not many husbands at the

[^1271]: Vide *Ṛg.* X. 85. 26 and 46. These are quoted in *Taittirīya Saṃhitā* VI. 5. 1. 4 and *Aitareya Brāhmaṇa* 12. 11. The word *dampati* (which occurs very frequently in the *Ṛg.*) conveys in several places the idea of a [[monogamous|monogamous]] marriage. Vide *Ṛg.* V. 3. 2, VIII. 31. 5, X, 68. 2.
[^1272]: Vide [[Rgveda|Ṛgveda]] X. 159, 5-6: [[अहमस्मि सप्त्नीनां सम्राज्ञी सर्वसामिदम् । यथा अहमस्य वीरस्य विराजानि जनस्य च ॥|Aham asmi sapatnīnāṃ samrāṅṅī sarvasām idam | Yathā aham asya vīrasya virājāni janasya ca ||]] (5-6). *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa* reads differently.
[^1273]: [[सपत्नीनां योनिष्विव मा कृधयन्तो यन्ति|Sapatnīnāṃ yoniṣv iva mā kṛdhayanto yanti|]] *Ṛg.* I. 105. 8; vide *Ṛg.* X. 116. 10 ([[अश्विना पत्नीयौ|Aśvinā patnīyau]]) where the [[Aśvins|Aśvins]] are said to have made [[the|the]] husband of maidens.

[[same|same]] [^1274] time'. The *Tai. Br.* (III. 8. 4.) when speaking of the *Aśvamedha* says 'the wives anoint (the horse); wives are indeed a form of prosperity'. [^1275] In the *Śat. Br.* (XIII. 4. 1.9., *S. B. E.* vol. 44, p. 349 ) it is said, 'four [^1276] wives are in attendance [[viz.|viz.]] the consecrated queen (*mahiṣī*), the favourite wife (*vāvātā*), the discarded wife (*parivṛktā* or *parivṛkti*) and the *palāgalī* ( who is low-born)'. The *Tai. S.* I. 8. 9 refers to the *mahiṣī* and *parivṛkti*. In the *Vāj. S.* (23. 24, 26, 28) there are verses which are addressed to the *mahiṣī*, *vāvātā* and *parivṛkti* by the *brahmā*, *udgātā* and *hotā* priests respectively. *Hariścandra* is said to have had a hundred wives (*Ait. Br.* 33.1). It is not to be supposed that polygamy was confined only to kings and nobles. The great philosopher *Yājñavalkya* [[had|had]] two wives, *Kātyāyanī* who was [[worldly-minded|worldly-minded]] and *Maitreyī* who [[thirsted|thirsted]] for the knowledge of *brahma* and immortality (*Bṛ. Up.* IV. 5, 1-2 and II. 4.1).

In the times of the *sūtras*, some sages wanted to hold up a high ideal. The *Ap. Dh. S.* (II. 5.11.12-13) declares that when [[a|a]] man has a wife who is endowed with *dharma* and progeny, he shall not marry another wife; but if any one of the two (*dharma* and progeny) is wanting (in the case of the wife), he may marry another before he has consecrated the sacred *śrauta* fires. In another place *Ap.* (I. 10. 28. 19) prescribes that one who abandons [[his|his]] (faultless ) wife should put on the skin of an ass with the hair outside and should beg for alms at seven houses for six months. *Nārada* (*strīpuṃsa* 95) [^1277]

In *Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā* 14. 35 the first three out of these four are mentioned in connection with *Aśvamedha*: [[होतारो अर्ध्वर्युस्तथोद्गाता हयेन समये जपन् | महिष्या परिवृक्तया वाचातामपरी तथा |||Hotāro adhvaryus tathodgātā hyena samaye japan | Mahiṣyā parivṛktyā vāvātāmaparī tathā ||]]. In *Ṛg.* X. 102.11 the word *parivṛkti* occurs which probably means the discarded wife.

recommends that the king should bring round to the proper path by inflicting heavy fines a husband who abandons a wife that is obedient, not harsh of tongue, vigilant (in household work), chaste and endowed with sons. Even *Kauṭ.* (III. 2) prescribes that a husband should wait for eight years ( before marrying another) if his wife gives birth to no child after one delivery or is sonless or is barren; he should wait for ten if she bears only still-born children, twelve years if she gives birth to daughters only. Then if he is anxious for a son he may marry another. If he violates these rules he must pay her gratuity, some wealth as *strīdhana* and money (prescribed to be given) on supersession and besides a fine (to the king ) of 24 *paṇas*'. [^1278] So far *Kauṭilya* appears to have only stated the ideal, because he follows up this remark by another statement which probably represented the commonly held popular view 'a man may marry several wives after giving *śulka* and *strīdhana* to those to whom nothing had been given at the time of marriage and money on supersession (*adhivedanika*) and suitable provision for livelihood; for women are (married ) for procreating sons.' Though *Ap.* and others held up the ideal of monogamy and *Nārada* and others prescribed [[a|a]] fine for marrying a second wife without sufficient cause, it is extremely doubtful whether a man was ever punished by the king for so doing. *Manu* V. 80 and *Yāj.* I. 80 both say that a husband may supersede a wife (and marry another) if she drinks wine, suffers from a disease (of long standing), is deceitful, is extravagant in expenditure, speaks harsh words, and gives birth to female children only. *Manu* V. 81 and *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 2. 65 allow a husband to marry another woman at once if the first is [[harsh|harsh]] of tongue. *Devala* [^1279] quoted in the *Gṛ. R.* says that the *śūdra* may have only one wife, [[a|a]] *vaiśya* two, a *kṣatriya* three and a *brāhmaṇa* four, but a king may have as many as he desires. This only reflected the prevailing practice of kings. The *Adiparva* [^1280] gravely remarks 'to have many wives is no *adharma* on the part of men, but to violate

[^1278]: Vide *Manu* IX, 81 and *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 2. 66 for similar periods of waiting. Vide *Yāj.* II. 148 for the amount of *adhivedanika* to be given by the husband.

[[P553]]

[[the|the]] duty owed to the first husband would be a great *adharma* in the case of women.' The *Mahābhārata* (*Mausala-parva* V. 6) tells us that *Vasudeva* [^1281] (*Kṛṣṇa*) had sixteen thousand wives. Several kings had in historic times as many as a hundred wives. For example, the *Cedi* king *Gāṅgeyadeva* alias *Vikramāditya* is said to have obtained *mukti* ( salvation) at *Prayāga* with his hundred wives [^1282] (vide *Jabalpur* plate of *Yaśaḥkarṇadeva* dated 1122 A. D. in *E. I.* vol. II. p. 4 and the *Khaira* plates of the same king in *E. I.* vol. XII. p. 205). In *Bengal* the evils of *Kulinism* are well known. The reasons for this treatment of women were many, such as the great spiritual importance of sons, early marriages and consequent illiteracy of women, the spread of the idea of the ceremonial impurity of women and their being equated with *śūdras* and lastly the idea of the complete dependence of women on men. One must not be carried away, however, by the notion that marrying many wives was either very common or was not looked down upon. Steele (in 'Law and Custom of Hindu Castes,' first published in 1826 ) who had the most unique opportunities for observing the practices of numerous castes in the Deccan in the first decades of the 19th century writes (p. 168, ed. of 1868) 'a man may marry as many wives as his inclination or circumstances allow. Marriages in succession, in consequence of the death of a former wife, are very common; but polygamy is not usual except on account of the barrenness of the first wife. It is practised in the Koonbee castes'. Vide also *Imperial Gazetteer of India*, Vol. I (ed. of 1907 ) p. 482 'Although in theory polygamy is allowed, in practice a second wife is rarely taken while the first is alive and in India as a whole there are only 1011 wives to every 1000 husbands so that even if no husbands have more than two wives all but 11 per thousand must be monogamous'. The state of the modern case law is unsatisfactory. The *Bombay High Court* has held that the mere fact that the husband has married a second wife would not entitle the first wife to refuse to stay with the husband. Vide *Motilal V. Chanchal, 4 Bom. L. R. 107*. In *Virasami v. Appasami, 1 Madras High Court Reports, p. 375*, the court held that a *Hindu* may marry any number of wives, although he may have a wife or wives living. It is submitted with great [[respect|respect]] that that is

[^1281]: [[ततो वसुदेवस्य बभूवुः षोडश स्त्रियः |Tato Vasudevasya babhūvuḥ ṣoḍaśa striyaḥ ||]] *Mausala-parva* V.6.
[^1282]: [[स्वर्लोकं प्रययुः सर्वे राजानो गान्गदेवाया |Svarlokaṃ prayayuḥ sarve rājāno gāṅgeyādayā ||]] *E. I.* vol. II, p. 4.

[[P554]]

not the ideal or the view of the best writers, nor is such a view held by the majority of Indian jurists of ancient and medieval times. Modern opinion of educated people is most favourable to making marriages monogamous and efforts are being made to secure absolute monogamy by legislative action. For example, the *Madras Nambudri Act* ( *Madras Act* XXI of 1933) forbids [[a|a]] *Nambudri brāhmaṇa* from [[marrying|marrying]] a second wife when the first is living except in three cases [[viz.|viz.]] (1) when the first wife is afflicted with an incurable disease for over five years, (2) when she has not borne a child within ten years of marriage, and (3) when she becomes an outcast.

## Polyandry

The passages cited above (note 1274) from the *Ait. Br.* and the *Tai. S.* that a woman cannot have several husbands at the same time make it [[clear|clear]] that in those ancient times polyandry was unheard [^1283] of. Not a single Vedic passage can be cited which clearly refers to the practice of polyandry. The most glaring example of polyandry in Sanskrit literature is that of *Draupadī* as the wife of the five *Pāṇḍavas*. Probably the tradition was too firmly rooted to allow the author to ignore it. The *Mahābhārata* shows that all were shocked by the resolve of *Yudhiṣṭhira* to make *Draupadī* the wife of the five brothers. *Dhṛṣṭadyumna* (*Adiparva* [^1284] 195. 27-29) tries vehemently to dissuade *Yudhiṣṭhira*, who tries to justify his action on the ground of ancient practice and the agreement of the brothers to share everything that any one of them may secure. But *Yudhiṣṭhira* could [^1285] ferret out (*Adi. chap.* 196 ) only two instances (rather mythical) in support of the practice [[viz.|viz.]] of *Jaṭilā Gautami* ( who [[had|had]] seven sages as husbands ) and of *Vārkṣī* who had ten *Prācetasa* brothers as husbands. It is this fact that has led many scholars to regard the *Pāṇḍus* as a non-Aryan tribe somehow grafted on the Aryan stock and represented as relatives of the *Kauravas* by the editor of the

[^1283]: Vide *Cambridge History of India*, vol I. p. 88, *Vedic Index* I. p. 479.
[^1284]: [[नैतद्धर्मविरुद्धं मे न लोकविरुद्धं न च|Naitad dharmaviruddhaṃ me na lokaviruddhaṃ na ca|]] *Adiparva* 195. 27-29; vide *Karma Parva* 68.35 [[where|where]] *Karṇa* speaks of *Draupadī* as '[[bandhakī|bandhakī]]' (a harlot), because she had many men as her husbands.
[^1285]: [[युधिष्ठिर उवाच - बहुपत्नीत्वमापदि दृष्टं हि वैदिके विधि|Yudhiṣṭhira uvāca - Bahupatnītvam āpadi dṛṣṭaṃ hi vaidike vidhi ||]] *Adiparva* 196.

[[P555]]

*Mahābhārata*. This too also sounds somewhat far-fetched. *Kumārila Bhaṭṭa* in [[his|his]] *Tantravārtika* cuts this Gordian knot by putting forward three explanations, one of which boldly [[asserts|asserts]] that there were many *Draupadīs* very similar to each other and so the epic figuratively speaks of one *Draupadī* only. [^1286] There were really five *Draupadīs* (and not one) married separately to the five *Pāṇḍavas*. In the *Dharmaśāstra* works there are traces of the knowledge of the practice of polyandry. *Ap. Dh. S.* (II. 10. 27.2-4) refers to it 'One shall not make over (his wife) to strangers (for [[a|a]] son by *niyoga*), but only to one who is a *sagotra*; for they declare that a bride is given to the family (of brothers and not to one brother alone); that (*niyoga*) is forbidden on account of the weakness of men's senses.' Similarly *Bṛhaspati*, while illustrating the proposition that the king should not disturb popular usages even though they may be improper, cites several such practices among which he mentions ' In some other countries there is the most reprehensible practice of a brother taking ( as wife ) the widow of his deceased brother, and the practice of delivering [[a|a]] maiden to a family ; similarly among the *Pārasikas* ( [[Persians|Persians]]) matches with a mother are seen '. [^1287] Dr. Jolly is wrong in thinking that *Bṛhaspati* refers to polyandry as practised in the south. *Bṛhaspati* first referred to the practice of marrying a maternal uncle's daughter as prevalent amongst the southerners (*dākṣiṇātyas*) in his day and then adds that a practice of giving a girl to the family is in vogue in other countries. So he clearly means countries other than those of the *dākṣiṇātyas*. Prof. Keith appears to follow Dr. Jolly without any independent examination of the original passage (in *E. R. E.* vol. 8 on marriage, p. 453). Just as *Bṛhaspati* refers to the *Pārasikas*, he speaks of polyandry as current among other countries ( but not Aryan India). There are two types of polyandry, [^1288] one matriarchal ( where a woman forms simultaneous alliances with two or more men who are not necessarily relations of each other and therefore succession is

[^1286]: [[यथा नैकैव द्रौपदी पञ्चानां पत्नी बभूव तत्र नैष दोषः|Yathā naikaiva Draupadī pañcānāṃ patnī babhūva tatra naiṣa doṣaḥ ||]] *Tantravārtika* p. 209.

traced through the female ) and the other fraternal, where [[a|a]] woman becomes the wife of several brothers. The former practice once prevailed among the *Nairs* on the *Malabar* coast, but it has now died out. The latter form of polyandry is still to some extent found in *Kumaon, Garhwal* and among peoples in the *Himalayan* area up to Assam. [^1289] *Paṇḍit Bhagwanlal Indraji* (*I. A.*, vol. 8, p. 88) says that in *Kumaun* between the *Tons* and *Yamunā* river about *Kalsi*, *Rājpūts, brāhmaṇas* and *śūdras* all practise polyandry and the children are attributed to the eldest brother who is alive. *Nīlakaṇṭha*, [^1290] the commentator of the *Mahābhārata*, raises ( on *Adiparva* 104. 35 ) the question about *Draupadī's* marrying five husbands and refers to the practice among very low castes in his day of one woman having two or three husbands.

## Mutual rights and duties of husband and wife

*Manu* (IX. 101-102 ) lays down in a [[concise|concise]] form the obligations of husband and wife [[viz.|viz.]] 'they should not prove false to each other till death ( as regards *dharma, artha* and *kāma*) and that their constant endeavour should be not to be separate from each other and not to break faith with each other (as to those three goals of human life)'. The detailed rights and duties of the husband and wife will be unfolded as we proceed.

The first duty of the husband and the privilege of the wife was to require and to give respectively her co-operation in all religious acts. This has been so from the most ancient times, [[In|In]] *Ṛg.* I. 72.5 it is said [^1291] that 'they, accompanied by their wives, worshipped the fire who is worthy of worship'. In another place it is said 'when you make the husband and wife of one mind, they anoint thee with *ghee* like a well-placed friend'. In the *Tai. Br.* III. 7.5 [[occurs|occurs]] [[a|a]] passage 'may the wife unite with her [[husband|husband]] by means of the good deeds ( done by

[^1289]: Vide the authorities quoted in Jolly's *Recht und Sitte* (Eng. tr. p. 103 foot-notes).

both ), they two became yoked like oxen to the sacrifice; may the two be of one mind and destroy their foes; may they attain non-aging light in heaven'. The same verse with slight variations occurs in the *Kāṭhaka Saṃ.* V. 4 and is relied upon by *Śabara* on *Jaimini* VI. 1. 21. This indicates that they were supposed to enjoy the fruits of their actions together. We saw above (p. 551) how in the *Aśvamedha* the wife anoints the horse, how in marriage the bride offers handfuls of fried grain into fire. It has already been seen (note 1208 ) that the *Ap. Dh. S.* (II. 6. 13. 17-19 ) requires that from the time of marriage the husband and wife work together in religious acts, that they share the reward of such acts [[together|together]] and that they both [[have|have]] dominion over the wealth of the family and that the wife can make gifts in the absence of the husband if occasion necessitates. The *Āśv. Gṛ.* [^1292] (I.8.5) prescribes that the fire kindled at marriage is carried by the married pair to their home (in a vessel ) and that ( I. 9. 1-8) since the day of marriage, the husband should worship the domestic fire himself or his wife or [[his|his]] son or his daughter or pupil ([[may|may]] offer worship in [[his|his]] absence), that if fire goes out, some teachers say that the wife should observe a fast, the [[domestic|domestic]] fire should be worshipped in the evening with an *āhuti* and the formula '[[agnaye svāhā|agnaye svāhā]]' and in the morning with an *āhuti* and the formula '[[sūryāya svāhā|sūryāya svāhā]]' and there is to be a second oblation each time silently (to *Prajāpati*). According to the commentator some said that the wife and daughter could not perform the *homa* as they had no privilege to learn *mantras*, that they could only kindle the fire, while others said they could do so. In the *gṛhya* fire kindled at marriage one was to offer the daily *mahāyajñas* (*Gaut.* 5. 6-8) and as regards *baliharaṇa*, *Gobbila Gṛ.* (I. 4. 16-19) says that both husband and wife should offer *balis*, or a *brāhmaṇa* may offer for them, or the wife may offer in the evening and the husband in the morning. [^1293] *Manu* (III. 121 ) says that from food cooked in the evening the wife should

[[P558]]

offer *balis*, but without *mantras*. This shows that though gradually women began to lose the right to repeat Vedic *mantras* ( as shown by *Manu*), still she had a hand in the religious rites. She had to perform many acts in sacrifices, such as unhusking grain in *sthalīpāka* (vide *Hir. Gṛ.* I. 23. 3), washing the slaughtered animal (compare *Śat. Br.* III. 8.2 and *Gobbila Gṛ.* III. 10. 29), looking at the *ājya* in *śrauta* sacrifices. The *Pūrvamīmāṃsā* [^1294] (VI. 1. 17-21) establishes that both husband and wife own property and should join together in performing sacrifices, but that the male sacrificer alone is ordinarily to do every act in all religious ceremonies except such matters as are expressly declared to be performed by the wife also or alone (as e. g. observing celibacy, uttering benediction [[etc.|etc.]]). It is on account of the necessity of associating the wife in all religious acts that the hero *Rāma* was compelled to celebrate sacrifices with a golden image of *Sītā* by his side. [^1295] *Pāṇini* (IV, 1.33 ) derives the word *patnī* and says that it can be only applied to a wife who shares in the sacrifice (and its [[reward|reward]]). It follows that wives who are not or cannot join with their husbands in *yajñas* are only *jāyās* or *bhāryās* (but not *patnīs*). The *Mahābhāṣya* [[says|says]] [^1296] that the wife of a *śūdra* is called *patnī* only by analogy ([[as|as]] [[a|a]] *śūdra* himself has no *adhikāra* for *yajña*, his wife can much less have it). It is on account of this close association of the wife in all sacrifices (either *śrauta* or *smārta*) that the wife if she dies before her husband is burnt with the sacred fire or fires and with the sacrificial vessels and implements (*Manu* V. 167-168, *Yāj.* I. 89). The *Tai. Br.* III. 7. 1 says 'half of the sacrifice is destroyed in the case of that sacrificer whose wife is (in her monthly course and therefore) unavailable on the sacrificial day.' [^1297]

But the wife is not authorized to do religious acts independently of her husband or without his consent. *Manu* ( V. 155 = *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 25. 15 ) ordains 'there is no separate *yajña* for

women ( independently of the husband ) nor *vrata* ( vows) nor fasts (without his consent).' Similarly *Kātyāyana* propounds [^1298] a sweeping rule 'whatever [[a|a]] woman does to secure spiritual benefit after death without the consent of her father (when she is unmarried), or her husband or her son, becomes fruitless for the purpose intended.' Vide also *Veda-Vyāsa Smṛti* II. 19. The *Nityācāra Paddhati* (p. 329 ) quotes *Manu* V. 155 and remarks that *Manu's* words are not to be taken literally but are only meant to extol the eminence of the husband.

Very detailed rules were laid down as to precedence among wives, if [[a|a]] man married several women. *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* (26.1-4) concisely gives all the rules. [^1299] If all the wives are of the same caste, then the [[wife|wife]] whose marriage took place first was to be associated with the husband in all religious [[acts|acts]] ; if a man had wives of different *varṇas* ( when inter-caste marriages were allowed ) the wife of the same *varṇa* with the husband had precedence, though her marriage might have been later in date. If there is no wife of the same *varṇa* as himself, the husband may associate with himself in religious rites even a wife of the *varṇa* immediately next to his own; but [[a|a]] *dvijāti* should never associate a *śūdra* wife with himself in religious ceremonies. Vide *Madanapārijāta* p. 134 for similar rules, *Vas. Dh. S.* 18. 18 expressly says 'a woman belonging to the dark *varṇa* (i. e. *śūdra*) is meant only for pleasure and not for performance of religious rites '. [^1300] *Gobbila Smṛti* (I. 103-104 ) contains rules similar to those in *Viṣṇu Dh. S.*, *Yāj.* I. 88 and *Veda-Vyāsa* II. 12 are to the same effect. *Viśvarūpa* on *Yāj.* remarks that though the eldest wife alone is entitled to take part in religious rites, all wives (except a *śūdra* wife) may be cremated with the *śrauta* fire. Vide *Sm. C.* I. p. 165. In the *Pūrvamīmāṃsā* ( IX, 3. 20-21 ) *Jaimini* discusses the question whether the direction in the *Darśapūrṇamāsa* ' *patnīṃ saṃnahya*' (having girt up the wife ) which employs the singular number

should be modified into the dual or plural when the sacrificer (in a model sacrifice or its modifications) has two or more wives and establishes that no change is required. The *Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana* [^1301] (I. 43-44) says that there were three views when a man had several wives [[viz.|viz.]] some said that all should be associated with him in religious rites, others held that only the eldest wife of the same *varṇa* should be associated and the third view was that the husband should never associate with [[himself|himself]] [[a|a]] wife whom he married for pleasure after he kindled the sacred fires. *Manu* (IX. 86-87 ) lays down that the wife of the same caste with the husband should always have precedence not only in the obligatory religious rites, but also in ministering to the [[physical|physical]] comfort of [[the|the]] husband and if a *brāhmaṇa* husband gets these done by a wife of another caste when the wife of the same caste is near, he becomes like a *cāṇḍāla*.

From very ancient times one of the articles of faith was that a man was born with debts, that [[he|he]] owed three debts to sages, gods and *pitṛs* and [[that|that]] by *brahmacarya* (student-hood ), by performing *yajñas* and by procreating sons he freed himself from those three debts respectively. Vide [^1302] *Tai. S.* VI. 3.10, 5, *Śat. Br.* I. 7.2.11, *Ait. Br.* 33.1. The last very succinctly states the purposes served by a son [[viz.|viz.]] payment of the debt to ancestors, the securing of immortality and heaven. *Ṛg.* V.4. 10 ('*prajābhir [[agnaye|agnaye]] [[amṛtatvam aśyām|amṛtatvam aśyām]]*') prays 'may I obtain immortality through progeny.' *Vas. Dh. S.* 17, 1-4 quotes these passages of the *Tai. S., Ait. Br.* and *Ṛg.* The *Ṛg.* X. 85. 45 invokes the blessing of ten sons on the newly married bride and the *Ṛg.* is full of the yearning for a son at every step. Vide *Ṛg.* I. 91, 20, I. 92. 13, III. 1, 23 [[etc.|etc.]]. *Jaimini* (VI. 2. 31 ) [^1303] discusses the passage of the *Tai. S.* and arrives at the conclusion that the duties laid down in it are obligatory and not left to choice and *Śabara* adds another explanation that these duties are obligatory on all *dvijātis* and the word '*brāhmaṇa*' is used in the

*Tai. S.* as illustrative only. *Manu* (VI. 35 ) enjoins upon a man that he should not think of *mokṣa* ( release from *saṁsāra*) before he has paid off the three debts and (IX. 106 ) further [[says|says]] that by the very birth of the eldest son a man becomes free from the debt owed to ancestors. *Manu* (IX, 137 ), *Vas.* 17. 5, *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 15. 46 contain the same verse proclaiming that [[a|a]] man attains all (heavenly ) worlds by means of a son and *Manu* IX. 138, *Adi.* 129. 14, *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 15.44 declare that a *putra* is so called because he saves his father from the hell called *put*. The *Nirukta* II. 11 [^1304] also derives the word *putra* similarly. Further the water and *piṇḍas* ( balls of cooked rice ) offered by the son to his father and other deceased ancestors were supposed to be of great efficacy for the peace of the souls of the departed. The *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 85, 70, [^1305] *Vanaparva* 84. 97, *Matsyapurāṇa* 207.39 contain a verse 'one should desire to have many sons in the hope that one of them may repair to *Gayā*.' On account of these several benefits conferred by a son, the highest importance was attached to the birth of a son. The wife helped [[a|a]] man to discharge two of his debts, to the gods by associating with him in sacrifices and to the *pitṛs* by procreating [[a|a]] son or sons. Therefore the goal of the life of women was declared to be to get married and procreate sons. This was so much the case from very ancient times that even the *Śat. Br.* (V.3. 2.2, *S. B. E.* vol. 41, p. 65 ) says that the sonless wife is possessed with *Niraṣṭi* (ill luck or Destruction). *Manu* (IX. 96 ) says 'women are created for procreation and men have to propagate ( the race ); therefore in the Veda it is declared that the wife shares in common (with the husband ) the performance of religious duties'. *Nārada* (*strīpuṃsa* v.19) also declares that women are created for ( procreating ) children. It was on account of these ideas about the goal of woman's life and the supreme importance of a son that the *smṛtis* and *dharma-śāstra* works recommended or allowed the husband to marry [[a|a]] second time even when the first wife was living.

All the *smṛtis, purāṇas* and the *digesta* devote a great deal of space to the duties of a wife. It would be impossible to set them out in detail. A few striking passages alone will be cited. All are agreed that the foremost duty of a wife is to obey her

husband and to honour him as her god. In the *Śat. Br.* [^1306] princess *Śukanyā* when married to the old and decrepit sage *Cyavana* to mollify the sage who had been wronged by her brothers says 'I shall not forsake my husband, while he is alive, to whom my father gave me' (IV. 1. 5. 9). *Śaṅkha-Likhita* [^1307] [[say|say]] that a wife should not hate her husband even if he be impotent (or have swollen testicles), *patita* (guilty of *mahāpātaka* and [[so|so]] an outcast), devoid of a limb or diseased, since the husband is the god of women.' *Manu* declares (V. 154) 'a virtuous wife should serve her husband as if he were a god, whether he be of evil character, or lustful ( loving another woman ) or devoid of good qualities.' *Yāj.* I. 77 enjoins upon women 'this is the highest [[duty|duty]] (*dharma*) of women that they should obey their husband's words ; if he is guilty of some mortal sin, they should wait till he is purified (and thereafter be dependent on his words )'. The *Rāmāyaṇa* (*Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa* 24. 26-27) remarks 'the husband is the god and the master of the wife, while she is alive and she obtains the highest heaven by serving her husband.' The *Mahābhārata* very frequently [[harps|harps]] upon the duties of wives. [^1308] The *Anuśāsana Parva* 146. 55 says 'the husband is the god of a woman, her (sole) relative, her goal'; the *Āśvamedhika Parva* 90. 51 declares 'the husband is the highest deity.' "'The father gives only what is limited, the brother and the son do the same; what woman would not worship the husband who gives what is unlimited or immeasurable!'" (*Śāntiparva* 148. 6–7). The *Matsyapurāṇa* 210. 18 contains this last verse and adds 'the husband is the god for women and is their highest goal.' This idea of the wife's entire submission to the

Vide *Manu* V. 151 for a paraphrase of this passage. *Śabara* on *Jaimini* I. 69 makes an objector rely on this *Śatapatha* passage to show that it allows *niyoga* after the husband's death.

husband [[is|is]] voiced even by poets like *Kālidāsa*, [^1309] who makes one of the pupils of *Kanva* [[say|say]] about *Śakuntalā* 'this is your wife, abandon her or accept her, since all-round domination of the husband over the wife is proper.' *Manu* V. 150-156, *Yāj.* I. 83-87, *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 25. 2 ff, *Vanaparva* 233. 19-58 (*Draupadī* as the speaker ), *Anuśāsana* 123 (*Śāṇḍilī* declares the conduct of virtuous wives ), *Veda-Vyāsa Smṛti* II. 20-32 ( wife's duties from morning till night ), *Vṛddha-Hārita* XI. 84 ff (wife's duties from morning), *Sm. C.* ( vyavahāra section) p. 249 ff, *Madanapārijāta* pp. 192-195 and other *nibandhas* dwell at length upon the duties of the wife. A few of such duties may be indicated here.

According to *Manu* V. 150 'a wife should always present [[a|a]] smiling face, should be alert and clever in her [[domestic|domestic]] duties, [[should|should]] keep domestic vessels well burnished and clean and should not be extravagant in spending.' *Manu* IX. 11 asks the husband to set to his wife the task of conserving the wealth acquired and looking to its expenditure, of keeping things clean, of the performance of religious [[acts|acts]], of cooking food and of taking care of household paraphernalia. *Manu* (IX. 13) adds that drinking wine, company of bad people, staying away from the husband, wandering about ( to *tīrthas* or elsewhere ), sleep (by day), staying in the house of strangers-these [[six|six]] spoil married women. *Adiparva* 74. 12 gives [^1310] expression to the popular notion that people do not like married women staying with their paternal relatives for a long time away from their husbands, since such [[a|a]] stay leads to loss of good name and character. The same sentiment is echoed by *Kālidāsa* in the *Śakuntalā* (V. 17). The *Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa* 77. 19 is to the same effect. *Yāj.* ( I. 83 and 87 ) requires the wife to keep household utensils and furniture in their proper places, to be clever, to have a smiling face, to be unextravagant, to be devoted to doing what is agreeable and beneficial to the husband, to show respect to her father-in-law and mother-in-law by clasping their feet; to

conduct herself decently, to restrain her [[senses|senses]].' *Śaṅkha* [^1311] lays down what is decent conduct for a wife 'she should not go out of the house unless she is asked (by her husband or elders) nor without putting on an upper garment; she should not walk fast; she should not speak with a male who is unrelated to her, except a trader, a *saṁnyāsin*, an old man or a physician; she should not allow her navel to be seen; she should wear her garment (or sari) in [[such|such]] a way that it may reach down to her ankles; she should not expose her breasts, she should not laugh loudly without covering her mouth (with her hand or her garment); she should not hate her husband or his relatives ; she should not be in the company of dancing girls, gambling women, women who make assignments to meet lovers, female ascetics, female fortune-tellers, women who live by tricks, magical and secret rites and who are of bad character; since (the wise declare that) the [[character|character]] of women of good family is spoilt by the company (they keep).' The *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 25. 1-6 ordains 'now then the duties of wives ( are declared); they should perform the same *vratas* ( observances and vows) which the husband undertakes; they should honour the mother-in-law, the father-in-law, other elders, gods, guests and keep the household utensils well arranged; they should not be extravagant in giving to others, should keep the goods well guarded; they should have no liking for magical practices (to win love ) and should be devoted to auspicious conduct.' Vide also *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* chap. 99 last two verses ( quoted by *Aparārka* p. 107 ). *Draupadī* (*Vanaparva* chap. 233 ) states

'whatever my husband does not eat, drink or partake of, I avoid. I know the total wealth, the income and expenditure of the *Pāṇḍavas*'. The *Kāmasūtra* directs the wife to make [[expenditure|expenditure]] that will be commensurate with the yearly income of the

husband. [^1312] *Manu* (VIII. 361) prescribes the fine of a *suvarṇa* for a man speaking with a woman with whom he is forbidden to speak and *Yāj.* II. 285 prescribes a fine of one hundred *paṇas* in the case of a woman who is forbidden to speak with a man (by her husband or father [[etc.|etc.]]) and a fine of two hundred *paṇas* in the case of the man who speaks with a woman with whom he is forbidden to speak. *Bṛhaspati* [^1313] says that a wife should get up from bed before her husband and elders, should partake of food and condiments after they have eaten, should occupy [[a|a]] seat lower than that of the husband or elders. 'A wife [[can|can]] engage in *vratas*, fasts, observances and worship (of god [[etc.|etc.]]) with the permission of her husband' [[Say|Say]] *Śaṅkha-Likhita*. [^1314] The *Purāṇas* frequently descant on *strīdharma*. A few specimens may be noted here. The *Bhāgavata* VII. 11. 29 says that the wife who looks upon her husband as the god *Hari* dwells in the world of *Hari* and revels with her husband. The *Skanda Purāṇa* (*Brahma-khaṇḍa, Dharmāraṇya* section, chap. 7) has [[a|a]] long description of a *pativratā* 'she should not repeat the name of her husband, [[as|as]] such conduct leads to the increase of the husband's life and [[should never|should never]] take the name of another male (v. 18), even when she is loudly blamed (by the husband) she does not cry loudly, even when beaten she is smiling (v. 19). A *pativratā* should always use turmeric, *kuṅkuma, sindūra*, lamp black (for the eye ), a bodice, *tāmbūla*, auspicious ornaments, and should braid her hair (vv. 28-29). The *Padma-purāṇa* (*Sṛṣṭi-khaṇḍa*, chap. 47, v. 55) says that that wife is *pativratā* who in doing work is like a slave, like a hetaira in affording sexual pleasure, like a mother in offering food and like a counsellor in adversity.

Special rules of conduct were laid down for a wife whose husband was away from home on a journey. *Śaṅkha-Likhita* (quoted by *Aparārka* p. 108, *Sm. C., vyavahāra* p. 253) contain a long statement about what [[such|such]] a wife should not do 'women whose husbands are away from home should avoid amusements of swing and dance, seeing pictures, applying [[unguents|unguents]] to the body, walking in parks, sleeping in open places (or uncovered).

partaking of sumptuous food and drink, playing with a ball, fragrant resins and perfumes, flowers, ornaments, ceremonial brushing of the teeth, collyrium ( in the eyes ).' *Yāj.* (I. 84 ) puts these briefly 'a woman whose husband is gone to another country should give up play, the adornment of the body, Visiting *samājas* (note 986 above) and festivals, laughing, going to the house of a stranger.' The *Anuśāsana-parva* [^1315] ( 123. 17) indicates that a wife whose husband is gone abroad does not apply eyesalve or *rocana* ( yellow [[pigment|pigment]]) to her body, does not take a ceremonial bath and does not use flowers, unguents or ornaments. *Manu* (IX. 74-75 ) requires the husband when going abroad to make provision for the wife's maintenance, since a woman without some means of livelihood, though originally virtuous, may go astray and adds 'when the husband goes abroad after providing for maintenance, the wife should live thereby and abide by the restrictions (laid down for such wives); if he goes away without making provision for her maintenance she should maintain herself by crafts (such as spinning ) which are unblamable.' The *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* (25. 9-10) contains similar rules. The *Veda-Vyāsa-smṛti* (II. 52 ) enjoins upon a wife whose husband is gone abroad 'her' [^1316] face should look pale and distressed, she should not embellish her body, she should be devoted to her husband, should be without (full) meal, and should emaciate her body.' The *Trikāṇḍamaṇḍana* [^1317] (I. 80-81 and 85 ) says that when the husband is gone abroad the wife may with the help of a priest perform the daily duties of *agnihotra*, the obligatory *iṣṭis* and *pitṛyajña*, but should not perform *soma* sacrifices.

The rewards of the wife's single-minded devotion to her husband and her rigid observance of the rules of conduct prescribed for her are stated at great length in *smṛti* works. *Manu* (IX. 29-30 = *Manu* V. 165 and 164 ) says that [[a|a]] woman who does not prove faithless to her husband in thought, word and deed (lit. body ) secures the ( heavenly ) worlds together with her [[husband|husband]] and is spoken of as a *sādhvī* (a virtuous woman, a *pativratā*); but by proving faithless to her husband a

woman incurs censure in this world, is born as a female jackal (in the next life ) and is afflicted with very bad diseases.' *Yāj.* ( I. 75 and 87) declares that the woman, who does not approach another while the husband is living or after [[his|his]] death and who is intent on doing what is agreeable and beneficial to her husband, who is of good conduct and has restrained her [[senses|senses]], attains glory in this world and plays with *Umā* (the wife of *Śiva*) in heaven. *Bṛhaspati* [^1318] defines [[a|a]] *pativratā* as one who is distressed when her husband is distressed, who is delighted when her husband is in delight, who is emaciated and wears dirty clothes when her husband has gone on a journey and who dies on the death of her husband.

In the *Mahābhārata* and the *purāṇas* [[hyperbolical|hyperbolical]] descriptions of the power of the *pativratā* occur at every step. Vide *Vanaparva* 63 where we are told (vv. 38-39) that when *Damayantī* [[cursed|cursed]] by her faithfulness to her husband the young hunter who had evil designs on her, he fell down a dead man. In the *Anuśāsana Parva* 123 *Śāṇḍilī* [^1319] who had attained heavenly worlds tells *Sumanā Kaikeyī* how she reached that state without wearing *kāṣāyas* ( dyed garments worn by *saṁnyāsins*) or bark garments and without having matted hair or without tonsuring her head (as ascetics do ), but by strictly following the rules laid down for virtuous wives, such as not addressing harsh words to their husband, abandoning all food that the husband did not like. *Anuśāsana* (146. 4-6) names several *pativratās* of ancient times and the following verses dilate upon the rules of [[conduct|conduct]] for virtuous wives. The story of *Sāvitrī* in the *Vanaparva* ( 293-299 ) illustrates the power of [[a|a]] *pativratā*, who wrung back even from *Yama*, the dread god of Death, the life of her husband. [^1320] *Sāvitrī* and *Sītā* have been held by the women of India for thousands of years as the

[^1318]: [[आसन्ने हर्षिता हृष्टा प्रोषिते मलिना कृशा | मृते तु म्रियते या पत्यौ सा स्त्री ज्ञेया पतिव्रता |||Āsanne harṣitā hṛṣṭā proṣite malinā kṛśā | Mṛte tu mriyate yā patyau sā strī jñeyā pativratā ||]] *Bṛhaspati* quoted by *Aparārka* p. 109, by the *Mitākṣarā* on *Yāj.* I. 86 (as *Bṛhaspati's*).

[[P568]]

highest ideals of womanly virtue, to which they have always endeavoured to approach and one may say that Indian women generally have most successfully lived up to that high and ennobling ideal that was set before them. *Vanaparva* (205–206) tells the story of a learned *brāhmaṇa*, who by his mere angry look made a female crane die when the latter voided its [[faeces|faeces]] on to the head of the *brāhmaṇa* and who was rebuked by a *pativratā* that the latter was not a crane, when the *brāhmaṇa* tried to frighten the virtuous woman for her tardiness in welcoming him as a guest and for looking only after her husband. The *Śalyaparva* (63) narrates how awful the power of a *pativratā* like *Gāndhārī* is in that she can, if she [[choose|choose]], burn the world, she can stop even the motions of the sun and [^1321] the moon. The *Skanda Purāṇa* III (*Brahma-khaṇḍa, Brahmāraṇya* section chap. 7) first names ( verses 14-15 ) several *pativratās* like *Arundhatī, Anasūyā, Sāvitrī, Śāṇḍilyā, Satyā, Menā* and then waxes eloquent over the tremendous spiritual power of a *pativratā* 'just as a snake-charmer [^1322] forcibly draws out from a hole [[a|a]] snake, [[so|so]] [[a|a]] *pativratā* snatches away her husband's life from the messengers of Death and reaches heaven with [[her|her]] husband and the messengers of Death, on seeing the *pativratā*, beat a hasty retreat.'

As the foremost duty of the wife was to honour and serve the husband, she must always stay with him and she had a right of residence in the house. A wife was further entitled to be maintained in the house by the husband. A verse quoted by *Medhātithi* on *Manu* III. 62 and IV. 251 and by the *Mitākṣarā* on *Yāj.* I. 224 and II. 175 and which occurs in some *MSS.* as a spurious verse after *Manu* XI. 10 says 'Manu declares that one must maintain one's aged parents, [[a|a]] virtuous wife and a minor son by doing even a hundred bad acts', [^1323] *Dakṣa*

II. 36 ( = *Laghu-Aśvalāyana* [^1324] I. 74 ) defines *poṣyavarga* ( persons whom 'every one, however poor, is bound to maintain ) as follows: 'the parents, the *guru*, the wife, children and a helpless man who has taken shelter with one, a guest and fire constitute *poṣyavarga*.' *Manu* VIII. 389 prescribes that the man who abandons and does not maintain [[his|his]] parents, wife, and son, when they are not outcasted, should be fined 600 *paṇas* by the king. *Yāj.* I. 74 requires the husband to maintain [[a|a]] wife whom he has superseded in the same way as before, otherwise he would be guilty of great sin. *Yāj.* I. 76 says that if a man abandoned a wife who was obedient, diligent, the mother of a son, and agreeable in speech, he was to be made to give one-third of his property to the wife, but if he had no property he had to maintain her. *Nārada* (*strīpuṃsa* 95 ) has [[a|a]] similar provision. The *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* V. 163 made the husband punishable like a thief, if he abandoned his wife. The husband was required by *Yāj.* I. 81 to be devoted to his wife, since women are to be guarded ( against falling into error ). Vide *Yāj.* I. 78 also. *Manu* IV. 133 forbids adultery with another's wife and *Manu* IV.134(=*Anuśāsana* 104.21 and *Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa* 34. 62-63) observes that there is nothing that harms one's life as much as adultery. *Viśvarūpa* [^1325] on *Yāj.* I. 80 points out that the guarding of a wife from evil can be secured only by being devoted to her and not by beating her, as, if the husband were to beat her, it might endanger her life. *Manu* (IX. 5-9) also calls upon men to guard women, and ( in IX. 10-12 ) says that they cannot be guarded by imprisonment or force, but by engaging them in looking to the income and expenditure, the furniture, beauty and purity of the house and the cooking and by [[inculcating|inculcating]] on them the value of a virtuous life. In spite of this the husband possessed certain powers of physical correction over the wife which were the same as those possessed by a teacher over a pupil or a father over a son, [[viz.|viz.]] he could administer beating with a rope or a thin piece of bamboo on the back but never on the head. Vide *Manu* VIII. 299-300 ([[cited|cited]] above on p. 363 ) which are the same as *Matsyapurāṇa* 227. 152-154. It will be seen that about two thousand years ago *Manu* did not confer

[[P570]]

greater powers of correction and restraint of the wife on the husband than the *Common Law of England* allowed to husbands even in the 18th century. [^1326]

As it was the husband's duty to provide residence and maintenance for the wife and as the wife was bound to stay with the husband, it follows that either party could after marriage enforce his or her rights in a court of law if the other party refused to perform her or his duties. In modern times a suit for restitution of conjugal rights can be brought and the [[decree|decree]] can be executed against the wife by the attachment and sale of her property ( if she has any), but not by detention in civil jail and against the husband by the court ordering the husband to make periodical payments of money for the maintenance of the wife and securing such payments by creating a charge on his property (vide *Civil Procedure Code of 1908 Order 21 rules 32 and 33*). To such [[a|a]] suit by the husband Indian Courts have recognised certain valid defences, such as desertion, cruelty or such conduct as endangers the health of the wife, change of religion, or keeping a concubine in the house or the husband's being afflicted with a loathsome disease (like leprosy ). Vide *Bai Premkunvar V. Bhika 5 Bom. H. C. R. (A, C, J.) p. 209* ( leprosy ), *Yamunabai v. Narayan 1 Bom. 164* ( cruelty ), *Paigi V. Sheo Narain 8 All. 78, Dular Koer v. Dwarkanath 34 Cal. 971, Bai Jivi v. Narsingh 51 Bom. 329*. Where the courts make the husband pay maintenance, they are in principle following *Yāj.* I. 76 and *Nārada* (p. 569). Vide *Binda v. Kaunsilia 13 All. 126* where many original Sanskrit texts are [[cited|cited]].

Not only was the husband bound to maintain the wife, but he was called upon to [[cohabit|cohabit]] with the wife and was supposed to incur the sin of embryo-murder if he refused without good cause to do so. On the other hand the husband had a right of

consortium [[i.e.|i.e.]] the wife was not to refuse herself to the husband and if she did so [[her|her]] [[delinquency|delinquency]] was to be proclaimed in the village and she was to be driven from the house. [^1327]

The humane character of the legislation of the Indian sages is seen by the fact that even for adultery they do not allow the husband to drive the wife out of the house and to abandon her. *Gaut.* 22.35 prescribes that a wife who violates her duty of chastity must undergo a penance, but she should be kept under guard and be given food. *Yāj.* ( I.70,72 ) declares 'an adulterous woman should be deprived of her authority (over servants [[etc.|etc.]]), should be made to wear dirty clothes, should be given food just sufficient to enable her to live, should be treated with scorn and made to lie on the ground (not on a cot); a woman becomes pure from adultery when she has her monthly period after that, but if she conceives in adulterous intercourse she may be abandoned and also when she is guilty of the murder of her foetus or of her husband or of some sin that makes her an outcast'. The *Mitākṣarā* on *Yāj.* I. 72 draws attention to the text of *Vasiṣṭha* XXI. 12 'the wives of *brāhmaṇas*, [^1328] *kṣatriyas* and *vaiśyas* who commit adultery with a *śūdra* may be purified by a penance in case no child is born (of the intercourse), but not [[otherwise|otherwise]]' and remarks that the words of *Yājñavalkya* are to be understood in the same sense [[i.e.,|i.e.,]] a wife is to be abandoned only if she be in adultery with a *śūdra*; and further that the abandonment consists in not allowing her to participate in religious rites and conjugal matters, but she is not to be cast on the streets; she is to be kept apart guarded in a room and to be given food and raiment (as stated in *Yāj.* III. 297). *Vasiṣṭha* XXI. 10 says that only four (types of) wives are to be abandoned [[viz.|viz.]] one who has intercourse with the husband's pupil and with the husband's *guru*, and especially one who attempts to kill her husband and who commits

Dh. S.* IV. 1. 19-20, 22. *Viśvarūpa* on *Yāj.* I. 79 quotes as *Baudhāyana's* verses 20 and 22. *Manu* IX. 98 is the same as *Baud. Dh. S.* IV. 1. 20. *Nārada* (4. 14-15) is similar to *Baud. Dh. S.* IV. 1. 20 and 22.

adultery with a man of degraded caste (like a leather-worker). *Nārada* [^1329] (*strīpuṃsa* v. 91 ) says 'when a woman commits adultery [[her|her]] hair shall be shaven, she shall have to lie on a low bed, shall receive bad food and clothing and her occupation will be the removal of sweepings of the husband's house'. *Gaut.* 23. 14, *Śāntiparva* 165, 64 and *Manu* VIII. 371 are more harsh on a woman who has intercourse with a low-caste man, [[i.e.|i.e.]] she is to be punished by the king with being devoured by dogs. *Veda-Vyāsa* (II. 49-50 ) says that 'a wife [^1330] who is guilty of adultery should be kept in the house but void of her rights of associating in religious and conjugal matters and of her rights over property, and should be treated with scorn; but when she has had monthly course after the act of adultery (and does not repeat it), the husband should allow her the usual rights of a wife as before.' *Manu* XI. 177 asks the husband to confine an exceedingly corrupt wife to one room and compel her to perform the penance [^1331] prescribed for males in cases of adultery. Vide *Atri* V. 1-5, *Parāśara* IV, 20 and XI. 87 and *Bṛhad-Yama* IV. 36.

Under the *English law*, if the wife commits adultery the husband's obligation to maintain her ceases altogether [[unless|unless]] he had connived at it or condoned it. [^1332]

The following propositions can be deduced from the texts cited above. (1) There is no absolute right of abandonment of wife in the husband on the ground of adultery ;(2) Adultery is ordinarily an *upapātaka* (a minor sin ) and can be atoned for by appropriate penance undergone by the wife; (3) the wife who has committed adultery but has undergone penance is to be restored to all the ordinary rights of wives (vide *Vas.* XXI. 12, *Yāj.* I. 72, *Mit.* thereon and *Aparārka* p. 98);(4) as long as the adulteress has not undergone penance, she is to be given in the house itself starving maintenance and to be deprived of all her rights as wife (*Yāj.* I. 70, *Śāntiparva* 165, 63 );

[^1329]: [[शिरो मुण्डाधशायिनीं|Śiro muṇḍādhāyinīṃ ||]] | [[प्रास्यादनावरत्रां च नित्यं मार्ज्या गृहे स्वयम् |||Prāsyādanāvaratrāṃ ca nityaṃ mārjyā gṛhe svayam ||]] (*Nārada* V. 91).

[^1331]: Penance will be lighter or heavier according to the caste of the [[adulterer|adulterer]]. According to *Ap.* XI, 60 adultery is an *upapātaka* and the ordinary penance for it is more or less severe (*Manu* XI. 118 ).
[^1332]: Vide *Halsbury's Laws of England* vol. 16 ( Hailsham ed.) pp. 609-610.

[[P573]]

(5) a wife, who commits adultery with a *śūdra* or has had [[a|a]] child thereby, who is guilty of killing her foetus or of attempt to kill the husband or guilty of one of the deadly sins (*mahāpātakas*), is to be deprived of her right to participation in religious rites or conjugal matters and is to be kept confined in a room or in a hut near the house and to be given starving maintenance and poor apparel, even after she undergoes penance ( *Vas.* XXI. 10, *Manu* XI. 177, *Yāj.* III. 297-98 and *Mit.* thereon); (6) that wives who are not guilty of acts [[mentioned|mentioned]] in *Yāj.* I. 72, III, 297-298, *Vas.* 21. 10 or 28. 7 are to be given starving maintenance and residence near the house even if they do not perform penance (vide *Mit.* on *Yāj.* III. 298); (7) wives who are guilty of the acts mentioned in *Yāj.* I. 72, III. 297-298, if they refuse to perform penance, are to be refused even starving maintenance and residence near the husband's house (*Mit.* on *Yāj.* III. 298 ). The propositions about maintenance set out here are accepted as the modern *Hindu Law* by the courts in India. [^1333]

It has been shown above (p. 518) that *Ap.* postulated the identity of husband and wife in religious matters and *Manu* IX. 45 declares that the husband is one with his wife. But this identity of husband and wife was not accepted by the ancient sages for secular or legal purposes. The rights of husband and wife as to each other's property and the liability of each for the debts of the other will be dealt with later on in detail. It may suffice here to point out that the wife was not ordinarily liable for the debts contracted by the husband nor was the husband liable for the debts contracted by the wife alone, unless the debt was for family purposes (*Yāj.* II. 46). Similarly the husband could exercise no dominion over the wife's own property (her *strīdhana* or peculium ) except in a famine or for a necessary religious purpose, or in disease or when he was imprisoned (*Yāj.* II. 147). These rules prescribed centuries ago compare in their fairness or reasonableness most favourably with the rules of the *English law* [^1334] ( as they prevailed before the *Married Women's Property Act of 1882, 45 and 46 Vict. chap. 75 ), whereby the husband by the [[fact|fact]] of marriage acquired [[freehold|freehold]] interest, during the joint lives of himself and

[[P574]]

his wife, in all estates of inheritance and life estates of which she was seised at the marriage or became seised during coverture, and an absolute interest in all the wife's personal chattels.

*Nārada* [^1335] (*strīpuṃsa*, V. 89 ) does not allow the husband or wife to lodge a complaint against one another with their relations or with the king. The *Mitākṣarā* on *Yāj.* II. 294 remarks 'though [[a|a]] judicial proceeding between husband and wife as plaintiff and defendant before the king is forbidden, still, if the king comes to know personally or indirectly of wrong done by the one to the other, the king must bring round the husband or the wife to the path of duty by appropriate punishment, [[otherwise|otherwise]] [^1336] the king incurs sin'. There were certain matters of which the king could take cognisance without the complaint of anybody : they were called *aparādhas* ( they are ten ) among [[which|which]] were included the murder of a woman, *varṇasaṅkara*, adultery, pregnancy of a widow from some person other than the husband, abortion [^1337] [[etc.|etc.]]. We have seen (p. 569) that *Yāj.* I. 76, *Nārada* (*strīpuṃsa*, v. 95 ) make the husband liable to pay one-third of his estate or a fine for deserting a virtuous wife and there are many such provisions about the matters affecting the husband and wife in which the king interfered. In *England* [^1338] at *Common Law* a wife could not sue her husband in tort (till the *Married Women's Property Act*) nor could a husband sue the wife in tort.

We must now turn to the position of women in general and wives in particular and the estimate of their character and worth made by ancient India. It has already been seen (p. 428) how the wife was looked upon as half of the husband, how in Vedic times women composed hymns and learnt the Vedas and how they co-operated with their [[husbands|husbands]] in all religious acts. On the whole their social position was much better ( except as to rights of property ) than what it became in later times. But

## Position of women

even in the Vedic times there was an under-current of opinion which was hostile to women, sneered at them and treated them with scorn. Some of the passages from Vedic and classical Sanskrit literature eulogising women and the wife [[have|have]] been set out above (pp. 428ff). The passages noted below [[may|may]] be read in this connection. [^1339] Vide *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 2. 63-64, *Manu* III. 55-62, *Yāj.* I. 71, 74, 78, 82, *Vas. Dh. S.* 28. 1-9, *Atri* vv. 140 141 and 193-198, *Adiparva* 74. 140-15%, *Śāntiparva* 144. 6 and 12-17, *Anuśāsana* 46, *Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa* 21. 69-76. The *Kāmasūtra* III. 2 says that women are like flowers ('*kusuma-sadharmāṇo hi yoṣitaḥ*'). It has been seen (pp. 146–147) how [[way|way]] was to be made by all for the bride and the pregnant woman and it will be shown that the general opinion was that no woman was to be killed on any account (with one or two exceptions [^1340] in ancient writers). Some of the *smṛtikāras* like *Atri* and *Devala* were so liberal as to say that women who had intercourse with one not of the same caste or who had conceived by such intercourse did not become outcasts, but only impure till delivery or next period when they became pure again and could be associated with, the child born of the adulterous connection being handed over to some one else for being brought up. [^1341] If a woman was raped she was not to be abandoned, but she became impure only till her next period ( *Atri* 197-198 ) and *Devala* ( 48-49) [[prescribes|prescribes]] purifications for a woman raped by *mlecchas* and [[conceiving|conceiving]] thereby. In the *Śāntiparva* 267. 38 it is said that it is not the woman who is at fault, but it is the man who is at fault ( when the [[woman|woman]] goes astray). In the *Varuṇapraghāsa* [^1342]

[^1339]: [[न गृहं गृहमित्याहुर्गृहिणी गृहमुच्यते | गृहं तु गृहिणीहीनमरण्यसदृशं मतम् |||Na gṛhaṃ gṛham ityāhur gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate | Gṛhaṃ tu gṛhiṇī hīnam araṇyasadṛśaṃ matam ||]] *Śāntiparva* 144,6; [[नास्ति भार्यासमो बन्धुः नास्ति भार्यासमा गतिः | नास्ति भार्यासमो लोके ह्यपत्यं धर्मतः क्वचित् |||Nāsti bhāryāsamo bandhuḥ nāsti bhāryāsamā gatiḥ | Nāsti bhāryāsamo loke hyapatyaṃ dharmataḥ kvacit ||]] *Śāntiparva* 144. 16; [[यया हि धर्मार्थकामानां त्रयाणामपि संगमः | यथा भार्याहृते धर्ममर्थं वा पुरुषः प्रभो | मामोति काममथवा तस्यां त्रितयमाहितम् |||Yayā hi dharmārthakāmānāṃ trayāṇāmapisaṅgamaḥ | Yathā bhāryāhṛte dharmamarthaṃ vā puruṣaḥ prabho | Māmoti kāmamathavā tasyāṃ tritayamāhitam ||]] *Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa* 21. 69-71.
[^1340]: Vide *Gaut.* 23. 14 and *Manu* VIII. 371 (both prescribe that [[a|a]] woman should be devoured by dogs if she had intercourse with a male of a lower *varṇa*), *Vas. Dh. S.* 21. 1-5. [[Even|Even]] this was modified later and only *prāyaścitta* was allowed ; vide *Vas.* 21. 10, *Yāj.* I. 72.

[[P576]]

(one of the *cāturmāsyas*) the sacrificer's wife had to confess if she had a lover and even when she confessed she was allowed to co-operate with her husband in the sacrifice. Vide *Tai. Br.* I. 6.5, *Śat. Br.* II. 5. 2. 20, *Kātyāyana Śr.* V.5. 6-10.

As against the high eulogy and considerate treatment of women a few passages unfavourable to women may be cited. We have already seen (p. 503) how woman was said to be 'falsehood' incarnate (*Maitrāyaṇīya Saṁhitā* I. 10.11). *Ṛg.* VIII. 33. 17 says 'the mind of woman is uncontrollable'; *Ṛg.* X. 95. 15 and *Śatapatha* XI. 5. 1. 9 declare 'there is no friendship with women and they have the hearts of hyænes' (addressed to *Purūravas* about *Urvaśī*); *Ṛg.* V. 30. 9 'women are the weapons and army of the *dāsa*'. The *Tai. S.* VI. 5. 8. 2 [^1343] says 'therefore women are without strength, take no *dāya* (portion) and speak more weakly than even a wretched man'. This passage ( which really refers to women not being entitled to a portion of *Soma* drink) is relied upon by *Baud. Dh. S.* (II. 2. 53 ) and [^1344] by *Manu* IX. 18 for prescribing the entire dependence of women on men, for depriving them of a share on partition or inheritance and of the privilege of Vedic *mantras*. The *Śat. Br.* (*S. B. E.* vol. 44. p. 446 ) says that woman, *śūdra*, a dog and a crow embody untruth, sin and darkness (XIV, 1. 1. 31). The same *Brāhmaṇa* (IV. 4. 2. 13, *S. B. E.* vol. 26, p. 366 ) remarks 'the wives being smitten (with *ghee*-the thunderbolt) and unmanned neither rule over themselves nor over *dāya* (share of [[property|property]])'. [^1345] Another passage of the *Śatapatha* (*S. B. E.* vol. 44, p. 300.) says 'He thereby makes women to be dependent, whence women are sure to be attendant upon man' (XIII. 2.2.4). These passages establish that even in Vedic times women were often looked down upon, had no share in property and were dependent. The passages about the character of women contain no more than what male [[cynics|cynics]] and critics of all times and in all countries have attributed to women such as 'frailty, thy name is woman!'. In the *Dharmaśāstra* Literature the position of women became

[[P577]]

## Dependence of Women

worse and worse as time went on, except as to rights of property. *Gaut.* 18. 1, *Vas. Dh. S.* V. 1 and 3, *Manu* V. 146–148 and IX, 2-3, *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 2. 50-52, *Nārada* (*dāyabhāga* 31) all declare [^1346] that women are not independent, but dependent in all matters on men and that in childhood, after marriage and in old age they are to be guarded by the father, the husband and the son respectively. *Manu* (IX, 2-3 ) refers to *rakṣā* (i. e. protection against harm or calamity ), while *Manu* V. 146–148 declare a woman's dependence even in all domestic matters at all stages of her life on some male. *Nārada* (*dāyabhāga* vv. 28-30 ) adds [^1347] 'when [[a|a]] widow is sonless, her husband's relatives are the controlling authority as regards her maintenance, the application ( of the husband's property ) and guarding her against harm; if there be no relative or *sapiṇḍas* of the husband, then a woman's father's family has control of her ; the creator assigned dependence to women as women even of good family fall into ruin by independence'. It has been seen above (pp. 561-562) that a woman's only concern was to serve her husband, and that she could perform other observances or [[undertake|undertake]] fasts and pilgrimages only with her husband's permission. Vide *Hemādri* (*Vratakhaṇḍa*, part I. p. 362 where several texts are quoted including *Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa* 16. 61 ). [^1348]

In the *Mahābhārata*, in the *Manu-smṛti*, in other *smṛtis* and the *purāṇas* women are charged with serious moral lapses. A few typical and striking passages from the great [[epic|epic]] are

[^1346]: [[अस्वातन्त्राः स्त्रियः कार्याः पुरुषैः स्वैर्दिवानिशम् | विषयेषु च सज्जन्त्यः संस्थाप्या आत्मनो वशे |||Asvātantrāḥ striyaḥ kāryāḥ puruṣaiḥ svair divāniśam | Viṣayeṣu ca sajjantyaḥ saṃsthāpyā ātmano vaśe ||]] *Gaut. Dh. S.* 18.1; [[बाल्ये पितुर्वशे तिष्ठेत् यौवने भर्तृगेहिनी | वृद्धापुत्रस्य तिष्ठेत् न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति |||Bālye pitur vaśe tiṣṭhet yauvane bhartṛgehiṇī | Vṛddhāputrasya tiṣṭhet na strī svātantryam arhati ||]] *Manu* IX. 2-3. The latter is the same as *Manu* V. 3, *Baud. Dh. S.* II. 2. 52, *Nārada, Dāyabhāga* v. 31, *Viṣṇu Dh. S.* 20.21.
[^1347]: [[भर्तुरभावे तु सुतानां सुतेषु च | तद्बन्धुषु वा पत्न्याः पोषणं रक्षणं च कर्तव्यम् |||Bhartur abhāve tu sutānāṃ suteṣu ca | Tadbandhuṣu vā patnyāḥ poṣaṇaṃ rakṣaṇaṃ ca kartavyam ||]] | [[परिक्षीणे पतिकुले निर्मनुष्ये निराश्रये | तत्सपिण्डेषु चान्येषु पितृपक्षः प्रभुः स्त्रियाः |||Parikṣīṇe patikule nirmanuṣye nirāśraye | Tatsapiṇḍeṣu cānyeṣu pitṛpakṣaḥ prabhuḥ striyāḥ ||]] | [[स्वातन्त्र्यात् प्रणश्यन्ति कुले जाता अपि स्त्रियः | अस्वातन्त्र्यमतस्तासां प्रजापतिरकल्पयत् |||Svātantryāt praṇaśyanti kule jātā api striyaḥ | Asvātantryamatastāsāṃ Prajāpatir akalpayat ||]] *Nārada* (*Dāyabhāga-prakaraṇa*) v. 28-30. *Medhātithi* and *Kullūka* on *Manu* V. 147 quote the half verse '[[न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति|na strī svātantryam arhati]]' and add another half verse '[[न च राज्ञां कृतेऽपि तु|na ca rājñāṃ kṛte'pi tu]]', which makes the king the ultimate protector of all women who have no male guardians in the husband's or father's family.
[^1348]: [[न स्त्रीणामनृते कामो न च कर्मणि पातकम् | धर्मो न जायते नित्यं धर्मेष्वपि च पातकम् |||Na strīṇām anṛte kāmo na ca karmaṇi pātakam | Dharmo na jāyate nityaṃ dharmeṣv api ca pātakam ||]] *Mārkaṇḍeyapurāṇa* 16. 61.

[[P578]]

cited below. [^1349] The *Sūtrakāra* concludes that women are 'untruth' (*Anuśāsana* 19. 6); 'there is nothing more wicked than women, who are the edge of a razor, poison, snake and fire in one' (*Anuśāsana* 38. 12 and 29 ); there may be at most one *pativratā* in hundreds of thousands of women (*Anuśāsana* 19. 93 ); women are really uncontrollable but remain within bounds as regards their husbands simply because other men do not woo them and because they are afraid of servants' (*Anuśāsana* 38. 16 ); vide also *Anuśāsana* chap. 38. 24-25, chap. 39. 6-7 ( women have the tricks of the demons *Śambara, Namuci* and others). The *Rāmāyaṇa* is not behind the *Great Epic* in condemning women 'This is the character of women seen in the three worlds [[viz.|viz.]], they are renegades from *Dharma*, fickle, [[cruel|cruel]] and create estrangement' (*Araṇyakāṇḍa* [^1350] 45. 29-30). In an uncharitable mood *Manu* (IX. 14-15) gives to women the following [[character|character]] 'they are lascivious, fickle-minded, devoid of love and come to dislike their husbands and resort to another man, whether handsome or ugly, simply because he is a man.' 'It is the nature of women to tempt men; therefore the wise do not act [[heedlessly|heedlessly]] with young women, who are able to lead a man astray whether he be learned or not' (*Manu* II. 213-214 = *Anuśāsana* 48. 37-38). *Bṛhat-Parāśara* [^1351] (*Jīvānanda's Collection*, part II, p. 121 ) says that the passion of women is eightfold of that of men. In modern times old men, though they might not know much of the *śāstras*, are often in the habit of repeating a verse which contains a list of the faults of women 'falsehood, thoughtless [[action|action]], trickery, folly, great greed, impurity, cruelty these are the natural faults of women. ' [^1352]

There are some writers who even in ancient times could not bear the undeserved censure of [[women|women]] and most vigorously

[^1349]: [[स्त्री हि नामानृतम्|Strī hi nāmānṛtam ||]] *Anuśāsana* 20. 14 is '[[एतद्धि नारीणां दूषणम्|etaddhi nārīṇāṃ dūṣaṇam]]'; [[नास्ति स्त्रियाः पापीयस्तरमस्ति |Naasti striyāḥ pāpīyastaram asti ||]] ......

## Defence of Women

protested against the injustice of these accusations. *Varāhamihira* (6th century A. D.) in [[his|his]] *Bṛhat-Saṃhitā* chap. 74 ( ed. by Kern) makes a spirited defence of women and eulogises them highly. He first says that on women depend *dharma* and *artha* and from them man derives the pleasures of sense and the blessing of sons, that they are the *Lakṣmī* (goddess of Prosperity ) of the house and should be always given honour and wealth. He then condemns those who following the path of asceticism and other-worldliness proclaim the demerits of women and are silent about their virtues and pertinently asks [^1353] 'tell me truly, what faults attributed to women have not been also practised by men? Men in their audacity treat women with contempt, but they really possess more virtues (than men). He then cites the dicta of *Manu* in support (verses 7-10). "One's mother or one's wife is a woman; men owe their birth to women; O ungrateful wretches, how can happiness be your lot when you condemn them? The *śāstras* declare that both husband and wife are equally sinful if they prove faithless to the marriage vow; men care very little for that *śāstra* ( while women do care ); therefore women are superior to men. Oh! how great is the audacity of wicked men who heap abuse on women that are pure and blameless, like robbers who while themselves stealing raise a hue and cry 'stop, O thief !' Man in privacy utters words of cajolery to woman, but, there are no such words after the woman dies ; while women, in gratitude, clasp the corpses of their husbands and enter the fire." It may be said that, barring great poets like *Kālidāsa*, [^1354] *Bāṇa* and *Bhavabhūti*, in the classical period

[^1353]: [[किं नाम नोपपद्येत स्त्रीभ्यो यन्निन्दितं नरेषु | प्रमाद्यद्भिः पुरुषैः स्त्रीणां दोषो न हि स्वभावेन | स्त्रियाः प्रसाधनं नास्ति तस्याः स्वभावेन |Kim nāma nopapadyeta strībhyo yanninditaṃ nareṣu | Pramādyadbhiḥ puruṣaiḥ strīṇāṃ doṣo na hi svabhāvena | Striyāḥ prasādhanaṃ nāsti tasyāḥ svabhāvena ||]] *Bṛhat-Saṃhitā* 74. 5, 6, 11, 15, 16. Verses 7 and 9 are the same as *Baud. Gṛ.* II. 2. 63-64 and verse 10 is *Manu* III. 58; verses 7-8 are almost the same as *Vas.* 28. 4 and 9.
[^1354]: *Kālidāsa* and *Bāṇa* both depict in very delicate and romantic terms the relation between a loving husband and wife '[[गृहिणी सचिवः सखी मिथः प्रियशिष्या ललिते कलाविधौ | करुणाविप्रलम्भेन रसानां हरता न हि |||Gṛhiṇī sacivaḥ sakhī mithaḥ priyaśiṣyā lalite kalāvidhau | Karuṇā vipralambhena rasānāṃ haratā na hi ||]]' *Raghuvaṃśa* VIII. 66; '[[सा हि नित्यं भर्ता धर्मपत्नी च|Sā hi nityaṃ bhartā dharmapatnī ca ||]]' *Mālatīmādhava* VI. Vide also the well-known verse '[[जननी चाप्यहं तव|Janani cāpyahaṃ tava]]' in the *Meghadūta* I.

[[P580]]

*Varāhamihira's* was rather a solitary voice raised in defence of women and in the appreciation of their worth.

In the midst of this dark picture and undeserved [[condemnation|condemnation]] of woman there is one very bright spot, [[viz.|viz.]], the high eulogy of and the reverence for the mother in all *smṛti* works. *Gaut.* (II. 56) first says that the *ācārya* (one's teacher of the Veda) is the highest among *gurus*, while some teachers hold that the mother is the highest. The *Ap. Dh. S.* I. 10. 28. 9 prescribes that [[a|a]] son must always serve his mother even if she has been an outcast ( for some great sin), since the mother undertakes for her son numerous ( troublesome) actions. *Baud. Dh. S.* (II. 2. 48 ) requires the son to maintain his mother, even though an outcast, without speaking to her. *Vas. Dh. S.* 13. 47 says 'a father who is an outcast may be abandoned, but [[a|a]] mother (though *patita* ) is never an outcast to the son. ' [^1355] "The *ācārya* exceeds by his greatness ten *upādhyāyas*, the father exceeds a hundred *ācāryas*, a mother exceeds a thousand fathers' says *Manu* II. 145 ( = *Vas. Dh. S.* 13.48 ). *Śaṅkha-Likhita* [^1356] give a very salutary piece of advice 'the son should not take sides ( in a quarrel) between his father and mother : indeed he may (if he chooses ) [[speak|speak]] on the side of the mother alone, since the mother bore him ( in her womb ) and nourished him; the son, [[while|while]] living, would never be free from the debt he owes to his mother except by the performance of the *Sautrāmaṇī* [[sacrifice|sacrifice]].' *Yāj.* I. 35 holds that the mother is superior to the *guru, ācārya* and *upādhyāya*. The *Anuśāsana Parva* [^1357] ( 105. 14-16 ) says that 'the mother excels in her greatness ten fathers or even the whole earth; there is no *guru* like the mother.' *Śāntiparva* chap. 267 contains [[a|a]] very high eulogy of the mother. *Atri* 151 [[says|says]] that there is no *guru* higher than the mother. The great

*Pāṇḍava* heroes pay the highest honour to their mother *Kuntī*. The *Adiparva* chap. 37 says that one may avert the [[consequences|consequences]] of all curses, but a mother's curse can never be averted. [^1358]

## Estimate about Women

Reading all that has been said in favour of and against women in ancient Sanskrit Literature it may be said that the higher minds of Hindu Society were quite aware of the worth of women, that they insisted on chastity as the highest virtue for them, that there was no doubt an undercurrent among common people of poor opinion about women, that those who valued an ascetic life and wanted to wean people away from worldly ties and attachments looked down upon women ('*vairāgyamārgeṇa*' as *Varāhamihira* happily puts it) and exaggerated their faults. It has to be borne in mind that many of the passages condemning women are put in the mouth of persons who were for some reason or other angry with women or wronged by them or dissatisfied with their conduct. Further in assessing passages disparaging the character of women one maxim of the *Pūrvamīmāṃsā* system must not be lost sight of. The maxim is stated by *Śabara* ( on *Jaimini* II. 4. 21 ) as follows : [^1359] 'the [[purpose|purpose]] of a text [[censuring|censuring]] anything is not censure pure and simple, but the purpose is to enjoin the performance of the opposite of what is censured and to praise such performance'. The object therefore of the authors that censured women was to inculcate the great value of chastity and obedience for women and not merely to paint a dark picture of them.

The rights of women as regards partition and inheritance will be discussed in detail later on. But a brief statement about them may be made here. *Ap., Manu*, and *Nārada* do not allow the widow of a sonless male to succeed as heir, while *Gaut.* 28. 19 appears to contemplate that she is an heir along with *sapiṇḍas* or *sagotras*. That the widow's right to succeed as heir to her deceased husband was not recognised in ancient

[^1358]: [[माता ह्यपाप्या दुर्निवार्या |Mātā hyapāpyā durnivāryā ||]] *Adiparva* 37. 4.
[^1359]: [[प्रयोजनं हि निन्दा निन्द्य निन्दितुं प्रयुज्यते | किं तर्हि निन्दितादिसरत्मशसितम् | तत्र हि निन्दितस्य स्तुतिर्न स्यात् |Prayojanaṃ hi nindā nindyaṃ nindituṃ prayujyate | Kiṃ tarhi ninditāditasarvamaśaṃsitam | Tatra hi ninditasya stutir na syāt ||]] *Śabara Bhāṣya* (p. 640); the *Śabara Bhāṣya* on *Jaimini* I. 2. 7. (p. 115) says '[[न हि निन्दा निन्द्यार्था स्तुत्यर्थैव |Na hi nindā nindyārthā stutyarthaiva ||]]'. Vide *Vyavahāramayūkha* p. 808 for the same maxim.

times is clear from the *Śakuntalā* ( Act VI) where the minister writes to the king that the estate of [[a|a]] merchant dying at sea will escheat to the crown and will not go to his widow. *Yāj.* II. 135. mentions the widow as the first heir of a sonless man dying separate; *Viṣṇu, Kātyāyana* and others say the same. So in medieval times the rights of widows to property were better recognized than in the times of the early *sūtra* writers. In this respect the position of women improved in medieval times, though in the religious and other spheres their position became worse, as they were equated with *śūdras*. *Yāska* while explaining *Ṛg.* I 124. states that in the southern countries the widow of a sonless man goes to an assembly [[hall|hall]], [[stands|stands]] upon a stool and when the members strike her with dice she gets the property of her deceased [^1360] husband. This implies that in Northern India widows did not succeed to their husband's property in *Yāska's* time.
