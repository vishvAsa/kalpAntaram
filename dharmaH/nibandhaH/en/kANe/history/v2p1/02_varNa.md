CHAPTER II 

VARŅA 

The number of works dealing with the origin and characteristics of the caste system in India is legion. Most of them, however, concern themselves with the detailed des cription of the bewildering variety of castes and subdivisions of castes in modern times and their present religious and social customs and usages. The origin of caste has given rise to great speculation and several schools of thought have arisen. Generally individual authors lay undue emphasis on one element or attach far too much importance to one point in tracing the origin of the caste system and its ramifications, such as race ( Risley ), tribe ( Ibbetson ), occupation ( Nesfield ). The study of the origin and development of caste in India is one of deep and absorbing interest to all students of sociology. A complete and critical examination of the several theories of caste advanced by distinguished authors and a detailed description of the hundreds of castes and suboastes now found in India is far beyond the scope of the present work. For those who want to make a thorough study of the most important works on caste a modest list is given in the footnote below.50

The oaste system has been highly eulogised and also most severely condemned by Western writers. Sidney Low in his * Vision of India' (pp. 262-263, 2nd ed. of 1907 ) speaks of the beneficent aspect of the caste system in the following eloquent passage There is no doubt that it is the main cause of the fundamental stability and contentment by which Indian society has been braced up for centuries against the shocks of politics and the cataclysms of Nature. It provides every man with his place, his career, his ocoupation, bie cirole of friends. It makes him at the outset a member of a corporate body, it protects him through life from the canker of social jealousy and unfulfilled aspirations; it ensures him compa nionship and a sense of community with others in like case with himself. The caste organization is to the Hindu his club, bis trade union, his benefit society, his philanthropic society. There are no work-houses in India and none are as yet needed.' Abbe Dubois, who wrote about 130 years ago after being in close touch with Hindus of all castes for 15 years as & missionary, remarks ( in his work on the character, manners and customs of the people of India, translated into English and published in London in 1817 ) 'I consider the institution of castes among the Hindu nations as the happiest effort of their legislation ; and I am well convinced that, if the people of India never sunk into a state of barbarism, and if, when almost all Europe was plunged in that dreary gulf, India kept up her head, preserved and ex tended the sciences, the arts and civilization, it is wholly to the distinction of castes that she is indebted for that high celebrity' (p. 14 ) and he devotes several pages to the justification of this remark, Maine in his 'Ancient

Law'( new edition of 1930 p. 17 ) characterises it as 'the most disastrous and blighting of all human institutions.' Sherring in 'Hindu tribes and castes' vol. III p. 293 says it is the most baneful, hard-hearted and cruel social system that could possibly be invented for damning the human race'. On the other hand Meredith Townsend in 'Europe and Asia' (edition of 1901 p. 72 ) wrote 'I firmly believe caste to be a marvellous discovery, a form of socialism which through ages protected Hindu Sooiety from anarchy and from the worst evils of industrial and competitive life-it is an automatic poor law to begin with and the strongest form known of Trades Union'. There are others, 51 though their number is small, that believe 

51. E. g. Sherring in his :Hindu Tribes and castes' vol. III p. 274 qaya It has been snid with some truth that casto promotes oleanliness and order and is in a cortain sense a bond of union among all classes of the Hindu community. Yet gurely these onds might have been attained in a simpler manner and by a loss antagonistic process. The invention of a project so wonderfully elaborate and intricate- & project of bringing into absolute;subjection two hundred millions of the human species by robbing them of their independence, ...... the invention of a project like this, so prodigious and far-reaching was not needed to accomplish such useful and boneficent ends. That another and very different object was in viow from the very first is abundantly manifest. This object was neither more nor loss than to exalt the Brabman, to food his pride and to ininister to his self-will.' Equally sweeping con demnation can be aad has been indulged in as regards feudalism and modern capitalism. Fick (p. 331) entirely scouts the idea that the theory of oustes was invented by the priests. There are soveral fallacios lurking in the above quoted passage of Sherring. In the first place, there is nothing to show that the oaste system was inyonted by any body of persons who could impose their will on a continent. The dystom simply grew up in the lapse of ages. Tho population of Hindus when Sherring wrote may bave been near two hundred millions, but it could not bave been more than & small fraction of that colossal opinber during tho thousands of years that the system bas tourisbod. Besides writers like Shorring pass over the great achievements of Indians under the caste system in Literature, religion and philosophy, in bandicrafts and in the fine arts and unduly exaggerate the defects of the system that have becomo glaring only in the maobina-made civilization of the 19th and 20th centuries. These critios igaore the great adaptability of tbe system, whereby it preserved Indian society from social anarchy during ages of foreiga invasions and internecine wars. While severely condemning the brahmanas the critics altogether forget that the vast and variod Sanskrit Literature owes its production and prosorvation mostly to the sacrifice of the brahmapes for ages.

that the caste system was an invention, an artificial product, due to the machinations of crafty brāhmaṇas. Every great institution has its extremes of good or evil. This work will endeavour to steer clear of downright and hypercritical con demnation of the caste system due to relying on modern stand points and conditions of society and unthinking adulation thereof. It will try to present and balance facts and though it cannot help passing judgments it will leave the reader free to judge for himself as far as possible. In the present work the discussion will be mostly confined to the evidence of Sanskrit literary monuments, ancient and medieval. An attempt will be made to trace the origin of caste from Vedic times, to exhibit theories of the Dharmasūtrakāras, other smṛtikāras and oom mentators on the subject and to describe the peculiar ceremonies, privileges, duties and responsibilities of Hindu castes 88 gathered from these works in Sanskrit. To discuss the feasibility or desirability of totally destroying the caste system or the ways and means of attaining that end is deemed to be outside the legitimate limits of this volume. It may, however, be expressly stated as the author's opinion, in order to avoid misunderstand ings or fruitless speculations about his personal views, that he does not think that the caste system was an artificial product due to the intrigues, greed and cunning of brābmaṇas, nor does he hold that it is feasible to destroy the whole edifice of the caste system in the near future. In the cities we may find some people taking their food together but the real India is in the villages, where in spite of the loud denunciations of reformers for a hundred years, the restrictions on taking food and inter caste marriages are almost as rigid as they once were. Our efforts must be direoted to wide and rapid spread of literacy among the village people, the diffusion of the idea of one people and one nationality and gradual fusion of small subcastes into larger similar units. We in India have no doubt reached & critical stage in our history when old ideals, institutions and 

( Continued frons last page ) system, no man was allowed to be useless to the commonwealth and bis conduct was a question of honour with his group. When all work was turned out with the hands, the caste system tended to preserve and augment the skill of artisans. Moreover what social organization is to be substituted and how is not made clear by tbese critics. Most of thoso critics have the western social systom based on wealth and the indus trial revolution in viow; but tbat system also is as evil as or perhaps Forse than the modern casto Byston.

habits are being shattered by the impact of new ideas and by the onrush of world forces. We bave to decide whether we shall make or be able to make a clean sweep of all old ideals and institutions as so much debris and rubbish or whether while keeping the old ideals and some of the old institutions as founda tions we shall build up a new social order and create and foster new babits of thought and action. It is beyond the scope of the present work to write more on this point. 

A sort of caste system based on birth and occupation did prevail in many countries in ancient times as in Persia, Rome and Japan. But in all these countries it hardly ever made any near approach in rigour and complexity to the oaste system that we have in India and instead of ramifying into divisions and subdivisions, it dwindled and disappeared in the course of time. Nounanimity seems possible as to the several causes and ciroum stanoes which led in India alone to the evolution of the stupendous structure of caste. Not only is it impossible to hold that the origin of the modern complexity of the casto system is to be traced back to one single cause, but it is diffioult to accept that even all the origins that have been postulated by the several authors can adoquately and satisfactorily explain the modern caste system. 

In most of the works on the castes in India a fow features are pointed out as the characteristics of the caste system and as common to all castes and sub-oestes. They are: (1) heredity i. e. in theory a man is assigned to a particular caste by birth in that oaste ; ( 2 ) endogamy and exogamy i. e. restriction as to marrying in the same caste and not marrying cortain rela. tives or other persons, though of the same caste ; (3) restrio tions as to food ( i. e. what food and water may be taken or not taken and from whom ); (4) occupation ( 1. e. members of most castes follow certain occupations and no others ); (5) grade tion of castes, some being at the top in the social scale and others being deemed to be so low that they are untouchable. Some authors58 like Senart add another characteristic, viz the oaste council with its ohiof having in meeting assembled among other matters the power to regulate the conduct of its members, to impose the penalties of fine or excommunioation for lapses. It may be said at once that this last is a feature

that is not found among most of the brāhmana and kṣatriya castes even in modern times and is not dealt with by dharma sāstra works. Endogamy is now the most prominent characte ristio of caste and so is the theory that it is by birth. The other three are more or less fluctuating from province to prom vince and age to age. In this work the first five characteristics of the oaste system set out above will be subjected to a close critical examination on the basis of the Vedic and dharma sāstra material. We must also remember that the attributes of caste have not been the same throughout the ages. There is great difference between the popular conceptions of modern caste and the conceptions about it embodied in the ancient and medieval dharmaśāstra works. In the twentieth century caste in India is a matter of marriage and to a much lesser extent of food and drink. As to avoca tions any one can at present follow any profession without fear of loss of caste excepting a few believed to be very impure and very degrading ones (like those of sweepers, butchers, tanners &c.). It is also not possible even now for any one to be generally accepted as a priest, unless he is or claims to be a brāhmaṇa. The old barriers that separated one caste or subcaste from another have been greatly shaken by the influx of modern ideas and the exigencies of the times and one may bope that in a few decades more caste will remain as a purely social institution regulating marriages and to a lesser extent oommen. sality (and not a religious one). Western scholars, in spite of their most commendable patience and industry, often present, through ignorance or lack of first-hand knowledge, the number of castes as larger than what it actually is. For example, Sherring (vol. II. Introduction pp. XXII-XLVI) gives an alpbabetical list of brahmanical tribes and remarks ( XLVII) * Hundreds of these tribes, if not at enmity with one another, cherish mutual distrust and antipathy to such a degree that they are socially separated from one another as far as it is possible for them to be-as much as brahmaṇas are from the lowest outoastes-neither eating nor drinking together nor intermarrying'. The list he gives is most misleading. To take only a few examples, he enumerates Athavle, Achwal, Abhyan kara, Apte, Agashe, Bhanu, Bivalkar, Badye, Bhide, Bhagvat, Bhuskute, Bhat, Bodas as separate tribes; but it is well-known to people in Western India that these are the surnames ( not subcastes ) of the Konkanastha or Citpavana brabmaṇas, who not only interdine, but also inter-marry among themselves,

The word varṇa means 'colour' or 'light' in most passages of the Roveda (e. g. l. 73.7, II. 3.5, IX. 97.15, IX. 104.4, IX. 105.4, X. 124.7 ). But in some verses of the Rgvedas? the word varṇa is associated with groups of people having a skin of a dark or fair colour. For example, we read in Rg. II. 12.4 (Indra) who placed low the dāsa colour in & cave (or darkness )'; in Rg. I. 179,6 'the fierce sage (Agastya) cherished both varñas '; in Rg. IX. 71.2 'like one (a fighter) who strikes the people he (Soma ) who is powerful goes giving out frequent roars; he exposes the Asura colour'; in Rg. I. 130.8 'Indra helped in battles the Ārya sacrificer...... Indra punished for the sake of Manu ( the dāsas ) who do not observe the ordinances and subdued (or killed ) the dark skin'; * Indra having killed the dasyus protected the ārya varṇa (Rg. III. 34.9); "You ( Indra ) subdued for Rjiśvan, the son of Vidathin, Pipru and powerful Mṣgaya; you mowed down fifty thousand dark (men), you sbattered cities as old age does shatter good looks' Rg. IV. 16.13; 'Somas, which strike away the dark skin' Rg. IX. 41.1. In Rg. I. 158.5 a certain dāsa is called Traitana wbich name has & Persian ring about it; In Rg. I. 104.% varṇa seems to be placed in opposition to dāse. These passages make it clear that the Aryas and dāsas were two opposing camps and both were designated varṇas on account of the colour of their skins. The Tai. Br. I. 2. 6 (with reference to the Mahāvrata in which there was a mook fight between a brābmaṇa and a sūdra ) says 'that the brāhmaṇa is the divine varṅa, and sūdra is the asurya varṇa' 54 If we can interpret the Rgveda verse by the help of the Tai, Br, then in Rg. 1X, 71.2, the words 'asuryam varṇam' mean 

gūdra tribe.'. There is no doubt that the word asura when applied to gods like Varupa has another meaning also in the Rg. In numerous places in the Rgveda the antagonism

Hore Sayapa interprets 'varṇau' as "kiina' and 'tapas,' but this is far-fetched and it appears better to take the passago as meaning that Agastya supportod both Aryas and disas. The words oannot reasonably be taken to rofer to Hrahmaga and Kṣutriya since there was no difference of colour between the two and since vargas have been four and not two

between the aryas and dāsas or dasyus is emphasized and prayers are offered to Indra and other gode for having subdued or for subduing the dāsa in favour of the Arya. Rg. I. 51.8; I. 103.3; 1. 117.21; II. 11.2, 4, 18, 19; III. 29.9 ; V. 70.3 ; VII. 5.6; IX. 88.4 ; VI. 18.3 ; VI. 25.2. In Rg. 1. 51.8 Indra is requested to mark who are āryas and who are dasyus. This does not mean that there was difference between the two in bodily appearance only; on the contrary the antithesis between the arya who is referred to as 'barhismat' and the dasyu who is styled 'avrata' clearly shows that the emphasis was rather on the difference of their cults. That dasyu and dāsa are identical in meaning follows from the same epithets being applied to both and from the fact that dasyu and dāsa ooour in the same verses as applying to the same enemy.ss In Rg. X. 22.8 dasyu and dāsa are used in the same verse as applicable to the same enemy. In Rg. X. 99.6 and 8 Indra is represented as killing both daba and dasyu respectively. The dasyus are described as 'avrata' (not obeying the ordinances of the gods ) in Rg. I. 51.8, I. 175.3, VI. 14.3, 'akratu' (who perform no sacrifice) in VII. 6.3,58 mṭdhravacaḥ' ( whose speech is in distinct or soft) in VII. 6.3 and V. 29.10,' anāsaḥ '( snub.nosed or dumb) in Rg. V. 29.10. It appears that dāsa and dasyu are synonyms and were sometimes styled asuras. For example, Sambara is called dasyu and dāsa in Rgveda VI. 31.4 and dāsa in Rg. VI. 26.5 and is also associated with asuras like Pipru in VI. 18,8; Pipru is spoken of as a dāsa in Rg. VIIT. 32.2 and as an asura in X. 138.3. Varcin is styled dāsa in Rg. IV, 30.15 and VI. 47.21 and asura in VII. 99,5. In Tai. S. 57 (IV, 3.11.3 ) also it seems that they are held to be identical. The enmity between dāsa and ārya is breathed in such verses as the following: Rg. II. 11.4 'vanquish the tribe of dāsas by the sun (i. e. by the help of a brilliant weapon ); Rg. I. 174.7You made the earth a pillow for the dāsa ( i. e. you laid him low on the ground); Rg. III. 12.6 *OhIndra and Agni, by one effort together you shook ninety

cities that had dāgas as overlords'. It is not possible to say that dasss or dasyus were some Aryan tribes that had fallen from the worship or culture of the Aryan singers of Vedic hyians. In many places the sage refers to the conquest for him by Indra and other gods of dāsas as well as Aryan foes. For example, 

• Protectors of the good! you ( two) killed Aryan foes and dāsa foes' Rg. VI. 60.6; 'Oh Indra and Varuṇal you killed dāsa foes and also Arya foas and helped Sudās with your protection' Rg. VII.83.1. Vide also Rg. VI. 22.10, X. 69.6, X, 33.1, X, 102.3. This shows that though the āryans had become divided and fought among themselves, they kept āryas and dāsas quite distinct. The foregoing shows that in the times of the Rgveda there were two antagonistio camps, of the dryas and dāsas or dasyus, tbey differred in the colour of their skins and also in worship, speech and bodily appearance. Therefore, in the earliest period we find the word varṇa associated only with dāsa and with drya. Though the words brāhmaṇa and kṣatriya occur frequently in the Rgveda, the word varṇa is not used in connection with them. Even in the Puruṣasākta (Rgveda X. 90 ) where the words brāhmaṇa, rājanya, vaisya and sūdra occur the word varṇa is not used. Hence, one may reasonably say that the only water tight groups that are positively or expressly vouchsafed by the Rgveda are ārya and dāsa or dasyu. It is often argued that as the word brāhmana denotes a caste in later literature, in the Rgveda also it must be presumed to have the same meaning. But this begs the whole question. No one denies that brāhmana denotes a caste in later literature. But whether it has the same sense in the Rgveda must be determined on the materials furnished by the Rgveda itself. Some rely on the word 'bra hmaputra' in Rg. II. 43,2 as showing that a brāhmaṇa became so only by birth in the Rgveda. But the verse begins by saying that' you sing & Sāma like the Udgātṛ priest and go 'brahma putra'must mean a ftvij whose duty it was to recite śastras (the Brahmapāochamsin ag Sāyana explains). It is generally conceded that the Puruṣagūkta is a muoh later hymn than most of the hymns of the Rgveda. In the whole of the Rgveda the words vaisya and sūdra do not ooour except in the Puruṣa sūkta, though both of them occur in the Atharyaveda (V. 17.9 for vaisya and IV, 20. 4 and 8 for sūdra and ārya) and very frequently in the Tai. . Besides we cannot forget that the final redaction of the Rgveda must be held to have been separated from the composition of the individual hymns by several hundred years ( if not more) and that even if it be oonooded 

28 



[ Oh. II 

that at the time when the Puruṣ&sūkta was composed, the four varṇas had been constituted and had become castes, yet the same cannot be affirmed for the time of the original composition of the other bymns. The word brāhmana occurs several times in the Rgveda: 58 'Oh brāhmaṇas, Oh pitṛs fond of soma! May the sinless Dyāvāprthivi ( Heaven and Earth ) tend to our welfare'; 'Like brāhmaṇas in the Atirātra where soma is to be drunk, utterring ( words ) round a lake full of water you havo, Ob frogs, gathered together on that day of the year on which the rains begin' (Rg. VII. 103.7 ); $"The brāhmanan, who drink soma, reciting prayers of the yearly sacrifice, have sent forth their speech ( R&. VII. 103. 8). In this verse brāhmaṇas are expressly said to be getting 'brahma' ready. 'May Agoi who devours every thing make that (dead body ) free from disease and ( may ) soms also ( do the same ) who entered into the brāhmanas' ( Rg. X. 16. 6). "When the brābmapas worship together as friends in hymns (lit. speed of the mind) that are fabricated from their hearts' (Rg. X. 71. 8). In Rø. VI. 75. 10 brāhmaṇas are invoked for welfare along with pitṛs. This shows that the brāhmaṇas were highly venerated. The other verses establish that they were the reciters of hymns (brahma) and drank soma. In Rg. VIII. 35. 16-18 we read 'You (As vins ) urge on (or inspire ) brabma, you urge on our thoughts (or actions ), you kill the evil spirits and subdue diseases; ( 17 ) you urge ksatra ( valour) and also men, you kill evil spirits ( same as 16 ); (18) you urge on the cows and also the Vis (the rest is same as 16 ),' Here it seems that the groups of people (viz. those who think and make songs, those who show valour and lead men, and those common people who tend cattle) are clearly meant. These verses may be conceded as pointing to the exis tence of three groups (brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas and vitaḥ ) but there is nothing in them to show that these three had crystal. lised into somewhat like the castes of later times. In Rg. VIJ. 33. 11 Vasiṣtha is addressed as brahman, but that does not mean that he was a brābmaṇa (by birth), as he is said to have been born of Urvaśi from Mitra and Varuna. Similarly, in

Rg. IX. 96. 6 (Brahmā devānām ) the word brahma to does not certainly mean 'brāhmaṇs by birth', nor does 'viprāṇām' mean "brāhmanas by birth'. In that verse one who is super eminent among a group is specified, just as the buffalo among animals, the hawk among carnivorous birds &c. Io Rg. VIII. 33. 19 'look down and not up: bring your feet close together; may thy kaśaplakas ( legs?) be not seen, for though a brahmā, thou wert born & woman,' it is impossible to hold that the last words mean 'thou wert a brāhmaṇa woman'. If it is only intended to refer to the fact that she is a brāhmaṇa woman, there is no reason why the Perfect tense ( babhūvitha ) is used and not the present. Here 'brahmā' most probably means ' a priest of that name', as that is the meaning in Rg. II. I. 2 ( brahma casi grbapatis-ca no dame). The word 'brabmajāyā' in Rg. X. 109.%, 3, 6 and 7 does not mean the wife of a brāhmaṇa by birth but rather 'wife of Bphaspati'. The whole hymn is obscure and more or less enigmatic or allegorical. In the Aitareya-brāhmaṇa 6' 35. 2-4 it is said that soma is the food of brāhmaṇas and that a kṣatriya was to press the tendrils of the Nyagrodha tree and the fruits of Udumbara, Asvattha and Plakga and drink the juice 80 pressed instead of soma. It appears, therefore, that the brāhmaṇas were a distinot group even in the earliest period of the Rgveda, Whether they were hereditary is certainly not olear; nor is there anything to show that there were restrictions as regards partaking of food from persons other than brahmanas or as to marriage. That brāhmaṇas in the Rgveda were & class by themselves may be conceded, but whether they had become a caste by birth is a matter of opinion dependent on the connotation given to the word oaste. Dr. Ghurye (Caste and race in India' p. 42 ) thinks, probably following the Vedic Index (vol. I on Ksatriya ), that the reference in Rg. X. 71. 9 to a false claim for being regarded as a brāhmaṇa points to the nonolusion that brāhmapas had become a caste. The verge literally translated means 'these ( persons) who do not move below nor beyond, who are neither brāhmaṇas, nor engaged in pressing some -- they

being ignorant and having reported to speech in sinful (or coarse ) language take to ploughshares and engage in (agri. oultural) operations'. It is difficult to see how there is here any false claim to be regarded us a brāhmaṇa. This verse means apparently that those who are not composers of prayers or drinkers of soma ( because they are ignorant) are men of low speech and have to turn to agriculture. Even in the days of the dharma-sūtras restrictions as to food and marriage for brāhmaṇas were not at all as rigid as they became in medieval and modern times; but even when these restrictions were not rigid it was clearly laid down that a brābmana is so by birth alone. The word 'brahma' generally means in the Rgveda prayer' or hymn'. Vide 62 Ry IV. 6.11, VI. 52.2, X. 105.8, X. 141.5 ( 'Oh Agni, make our prayer and sacrifice prosper by your flaines'). Rg. III. 53.12 is this brahma (prayer or spiritual power) of Viśvāmitra protects the Bharata people'. In the Atharvaveda II. 15.4 (as brahma and kṣatra entertain no fear, nor are they harmed) brahma seems to mean the class of brāhmaṇas'. The transition of ineaning from 'brahma' (prayer) to 'brahma' meaning the class of those who composed or recited prayers is natural and easy. In the Rgveda I. 157.2 both brahina and kpatra occure3 in the same verse where they probably mean 'prayer' and 'valour' respectively. In the Atharvaveda III. 19.1 both words ocour and probably mean the same thing as in Rg. I. 157,2. In some Vedic works brahma and kṣatra stand collectively for brāhmaṇas 4 and ksatriyas ( e. g. Tai. Br. II. 7.18, Bṛ. Up. I. 4.11, Kathopaniṣad I. 2. 24). The word kṣatriya is very frequently applied as an epithet to several gods; e. 8. Rg. VII. 64. 2 and VIII. 25. 8 (in both to Mitra and Varuna ), Rg. VIII. 67. 1 (to Adity as ), Rg. X. 66.8 (to gods in general). In some verges kṣatriya means'a king or a nobleman'; o. g. Rg. IV, 42.1 'the kingdom on both sides (heaven and earth) belongs to me, who am & kṣatriya and who holds sway over all living persons, so that all the immortals (gods) are ours (on my side)'; &Rg.

( = Atharva V. 17.3 ) the domain of the ksatriya has been protected (from the sight of enemies )'. The word 'rājanya occurs in the Rgveda only in the Purusasūkta. It ocours in the sense of kṣatriya in the Atharvaveda V. 17.9. The same remark applies to the word kṣatriya as to brāhmang. It is difficult to say whether kṣatriyas were so by birth in the times of the hymns of the Rg. or were only a class more or less fluid. We find that the Rg. speaks of Devāpi as the purohita of Santanu who became a king. The story is tbat both were sons of Rṣtiṣena and that Santanu, though a younger brother, became king as Devāpi was not willing to be a king. The result was a famine due to Santanu's transgression and 80 Devāpi performed & sacrifice to induce rainfall. This shows that out of two brothers one became a king and the other & purohita. So kings and purohitas did not depend on birth. In Rg. IX. 112, 3 a poet exolaims ' I am a reciter of hymns my father is & physician and my mother grinds ( corn ) with stones. We desire to obtain wealth in various actions. 67 In Rg. III. 44.5 the poet wistfully asks Indra 'O, Indra, fond of soma, would you make me the protector of people, or would you make me & king, would you make me & sage, that has drunk of soma, would you impart to me endless wealth ?' This shows that the same man could be a ṛṣi or & noble or a king. Dr. Ghurye (in 'Caste and race in India' p. 44) thinks that the kṣatriyas had become a compact body and he particularly relies on Rg. VII. 104. 13 ( = Atharvaveda VIII, 4. 13 ) which is cited in the Vedic Index (vol. 1, p. 207 ) for the same purpose. That verse literally means ' Soma does not urge on the crooked one, nor the kṣatriya who bears false. He strikes the rakṣas, and strikes him who speaks falsely; both lie in the bonds of Indra'. The words * kṣatriyam mithuya dharayantam' are explained by Sayaṇa as * Ksatriya who bears false words'. The 2nd half is only an expansion of the first half and so 'vṛjina' corresponds to *rakṣas' and 'asad vadantan' is only a paraphrase of 'mithuyā dbārayantam'. They may mean this that one who is a kṣatriya, but has no strength as a kṣatriya abould have, is at

the ineroy of Indra. Unless we project our notions of the later state of society and the caste system when considering this verse, it is hardly possible to hold that this verse indicates that it refers to persons making a false claim for entrance into & com pact body of ksatriyas by birth. Dr. Ghurye also says (p. 44 ) *The 2nd order in society, the kṣatriya, is known in the earlier portions of the Rgveda as rājanya.' I have not been able to find the word rājanya in the Rgveda any where except in the Puruṣa - sākta. In the Aitareya brahmans (chap. 34. 2) the word 'rājanya' stands for a member of the 2nd class in society, while ksatriya means a king of whom land ( for sacrifice to gods ) is asked for by brāhmaṇa, rājanya or vaisya. 

Though the word vaisya ooours in the Rgveda only in the Purugasūkta, the word 'vis' is very frequently employed in it. It generally means people or group of people'. In a large number of cases we have the words mānuṣīr-visaḥ or mānuṣiṇu vikṣu or mānuṣiṇām vigām, 0.g. Rg. III.5.3, III.6.3, III. 11.5 (invincible Agni goes in front of human groups ), IV. 6. 7 and 8, IV.9.2, V. 1. 9, V. 8,3, VI. 48. 8, VI. 47. 16 ( viso mānuṣyān ), X. I. 4, X. 69. 9. In some places we have dāsir visah' (the dāsa hordes ) e. g. IV. 28-4, VL. 25.2. In 68 Rg. III. 34.2 we have 'Ob Indra, you are the leader of human hordes as well as of divine hordes' (where we have daivinām visām). Rg. 69 VIII. 63.7 ( when loud invocations were sent towards Indra by the people consisting of five groups ) shows that'vis' means all the Aryan people. In Rg. V. 32. 11 Indra is styled 'pāñcajanya'(favourable to the five people ) and in IX. 66. 20 Agni has the appellation pañcajanyaḥ purohitab (the purohita of the five peoples). Sometimes jana and viś seem to be contradistinguished as in Rg. II. 26. 3 ( sa ij-janena sa visā ga janmanā 88 putrair-vājam bharate dhana npbhib ). But the very fact that vis is qualified also as pāñoajanya shows that

there was hardly any distinction between jana and vis, In the Rg veda frequent reference is made to five people (pañoa janaḥ ); vide Rg. III. 37. 9, III. 59.7, VI. 11. 4, VIII. 32. 22, X. 65.23, X. 45,6. In the same way the words krsti (II. 2. 10, IV.38.10), kṣiti (V. 35. 2, VI. 48. 7, VII. 75, 4 ), oarsani( V.86.2, VII, 15.2 ) are employed along with pañca. We have also pāñcajanyasu krsṭiṣu' in Rg. III. 53.16. So it is clear that vis cannot in almost all hymns of the Rg, mean' vaiśya ' but means the people' or 

ārgan people' when no epithet like 'dāsih' or daivih is prefixed. The Ait. Br. (1. 26 ) says that visaḥ' means 

rāstrāṇi' (countries) when explaining Rg. IV. 50.8 ( tasmai viśaḥ svayam-avānamante ). 

The word 'dāsa' in later literature means '& serf or a slave.' It follows that the dāsa tribes that we see opposed to the Aryas in the Rgvoda were gradually vonquished and were then made to serve the Aryas. In the Manusmști (VIII. 413 ) the sūdra is said to have been created by God for service (dāsya ) of the brāhmapa.71 We find in the Tai. S., the Tai. Br. and other Brāhmaṇa works that the sūdra oooupies the same position that he does in the smśtis. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that the dāss or dasyus conquered by the Aryas were gradually transformed into the sūdras, From being enemies they were brought into friendly relations and given & very subordinate position. Traces are visible even in the Rgveda that friendly relations had begun to be established between certain dāsas and the priests. For example in Rg. VIII. 46. 32 we read * the singer took a hundred (cows or other gifts) from the dāsa Balbūtha and froin Tarukṣa.' In the Puruṣasūkta (X. 90.12 ) the brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaisya and sūdra are said to have sprung from the mouth, arms, thighs and feet of the supreme Puruṣa. In the very next verse the sun and the moon are said to have been born from the eye and mind of the Purusa. This shows that the composer of the hymn regarded the division of society into four classes to be very ancient and to be as natural and God-ordained as the sun and the moon. 

We shall now see what position was assigned to the sūdra in the Vedic Samhitās and Brābmapas. In the Rgveda the Ārya is contradistinguished from the men of dark skin. In the dharmasūtras we find the Sūdras spoken of as 'dark varṇa.'

Therefore those two, the horse and the sūdra, are the convey. ances of beings; therefore the sūdrs is not fit (or ordained ) for sacrifice' (Tai. S. VII. 1. 1. 6).73 This shows that the sūdrs could not perform the Vedic sacrifices and that he was employed for carrying persons in & palanquin or otherwise. In Tai. S. V. 7. 6. 3-4 we have put light (glory) in our brahmaṇas, put it in our chiefs (or kings ), (put) light in vaisyas and sūdras, put light in me by your light.'74 This is a sure indication that the sūdra who took the place of the dāsa is here placed on the same level with the other three classes in the matter of the receipt of light from God and that far from being looked upon as an enemy, he had come to be looked upon as a member of the society (though the lowest in the scale). 'The sūdra is a moving burial ground; therefore one should not study the Veda in the vicinity of a sūdra.' 7 'He created the brāh inana with Gayatri, the rājanya with Triṣtubh and the vaisya with Jagati; but he did not create the sūdra with any metre. 76 The Tandyamahābrāhmaṇa saya " 'Therefore a sūdra, though he may have many beasts, is not entitled to perform sacrifice, he is godless as no deity was created after bim (as in the case of the other varṇas ); therefore he does not go beyond washing the feet (of the three other varṇas ), since he was created from the foet' (this last being an allusion to the Puruṣasūkta X, 90, 12 pudbhyām śūdro ajāyata ). This sbows that the sūdra, however rich in cattle he might be, had to perform the menial duty of washing the feet of dvijus. The

Varna : position of sūdra 

35 

Satapatha Br, says that the sūdrn is untruth' (8. B. E. vol. 44. p. 446 ), that the sūdra is toil' (S. B. E. vol. 44 p. 410), and that a dikṣita ( one who was initiated for a Vedic sacrifice ) was not to speak with a gūdra (S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 4). The Aitareya Brāhmaṇa remarks that 'the sūdra78 is at the beck and call of others ( the three varṇas), ho can be made to rise at will, he can be beaten at will.' When the father of Sunaḥsepa?' ( who had sold Sunshseps for 100 coins and had shown himself ready to kill him as a paśu for another hundred coins ) urged his son to come back to him after the boy had been taken into favour by Varuna and Viśvamitra, he contemptu. ously discards his father's proposal with the words ' one who commits an evil deed once may commit another sinful deed thereafter; you did not leave aside the sūdra's line of conduct; you did what leaves no door for reconoiliation.' These passages show that the sūdra, though he had ceased to be an enemy of the arya and had been allowed to be within the pale of society, was looked down upon, was assigned a very low position, had to perform work of toil as a menial and was not allowed to perform Vedic sacrifices. A clear line of demarca tion was kept between the Arya and the Sūdra in the times of the Brāhmaṇa works and even in the dharmasūtras. The Tandya Brabmaṇaso speaks of a mook fight 'the sūdra and ārya fight on a hide, out of the two they 80 arrange that the arya colour becomes the victor'. The Ap. Dh. 8. (1. 1.3.40-41 Bayg8l that a brāhmaoārin, if he cannot himself eat all the food he has brought by begging, may keep it near an ārya (for bis use ) or he may give it to a sūdra who is a dāsa ( of his teacher). The same Dharmasūtra8% (II. 2.3. I and 4 ) Says 'Aryas who are pure (by bath) should prepare the food for Vaiśvadeva ;......or sūdras supervised by Aryas should prepare it'. Similarly Gautama X. 69 uses the word 'anārya for sūdra and Gautama 12.3 prescribes heavy punishment for a

gūdra having sexual intercourse with an ārya woman. Jaimini in his Pūrvamimāðsā sūtra (VI. 1.25-38 ) establishes after elaborate discussion that the sūdra has no adhikāra for the performance of Agnihotra and Vedic sacrifices. It is, however, somewhat gratifying to find that at least one ācārya, Bādari, espoused the cause of the sūdra and propounded the view that all ( including sūdras ) were entitled to perform Vedic sacrifices (VI. 1.27). In the Vedānta-sūtras also (I. 3.34-38 ) it is established that the sūdra has no adhikūra for brahmavidyā based on Veda study, though some sūdras like Vidura might have been endowed with the knowledge of brahma owing to samskāras of former births. In the smrti literature, however, a few passages are found allowing marriages of aryas with sūdra women (which will be discussed later on). Similarly sexual relations ( illicit) between & sūdra woman and & man of higher varṇa are alluded to even in the Samhitās e. g. Tai. 8.88 VII. 4.19.3 ' when & sūdra woman has an ārya as her paramour she does not seek wealth for the prosperity ( of her relations )'. In Ait. Br. (8. 1) there is the story of Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, who was driven out from the sacrifice on the Sarasvati with the words 'Oh, son of a female slave, you are a rogue and not a brahmana ; how did you take the dikṣs (initiation) as one of us' and they carried hiin off to & sandy desert with the idea that he might die of thirst there. He when tormented by thirst' saw' the hymn Rg. X. 30 and Sarasvati came rushing to him.4 Further discussion about the sūdra and his dis abilities will follow in another section later, 

The position of the three varṇas inter se ( called collectively arya ) now requires consideration. It is clear that the Samhitas other than the Rgveda and Brāhmaṇa works show that the three classes of brāhmaṇas, ksatriyas and vaisyas had bocome differ entiated and their privileges, duties and liabilities had become more or less fixed in those times.

In Rg. IV. 50.8 we read that king alone who places brabma first (i. e. honours him ) dwells happy in his house, for him the earth always remains prosperous and to him all the people (or kingdoms ) bow down of their own accord'. 'Brāhmaṇas 85 are gods that are directly seen' (Tai. S. I. 7.3.1); 'there are two kinds of gods; for indeed the gods are gods and the brāhmaṇas who have studied and teach the sacred lore are the human gods' Śat. Br. (S. B, E. vol. 12 p. 309, vol. 26 p. 341 ). In the Atharvaveda V. 17. 19 there is an assertion of the pre-eminence of brāhmaṇas and the consequences of harming them or their cows. Therefore the brāhmaṇa is the foremost '(Tai. 8. II. 6.2.5, V.2.7.1). Therefore the brāhmaṇa shows his might by his mouth, since he was created from the mouth' ( Tāndya Br. XI. 1. 2 ).88 In the Ait. Br. ( 33. 4) Varuṇa, when he was told that a brāhmaṇa boy would be offered in place of the son of the king Hariscandra, is made to say 'a brāhmaṇa is indeed pre ferable to a ksatriya'. The mere fact of birth as brahmana's son is represented here as giving to the boy pre-eminence over a king's son. On the other hand the Sat. Br. says (V. 1. 1. 12) 'a brāhmaṇa 87 is not adequate to ( competent to manage ) a kingdom'. In the Tai. Br. it is said that playing on the viṇā ( in the Aévamedha ) is to be done by a brāhmaṇa and a rājanya (and not by two brāhmaṇas ), since wealth does not find delight in the brāhmaṇa. The Satapatha Brāhmaṇa 88 ( XI. 5. 7,1 )lays emphasis on the four peculiar attributes of brābmaṇas viz. brāhmanya ( purity of parentage as a brāhmaṇa ), pratirūpacaryā ( befitting deportment or conduct ), yasas ( glory ) and lokapakti ( the teaching or perfecting of people ). "When the people are being perfected or taught by him, people endow him with four privileges viz. arcā ( honour), dāna (gifts ), ajyeyatā (freedom

Teaching had become so much associated with the brāhmaṇas that when the brahmana Gārgya approached king Ajātasatru for the knowledge of brahma, the latter replied “this is oontrary to the natural order that a brāhmaṇa should approach a ksatriya with the idea" he ( ksatriya) will propound to me brahma.." In a separate section below all the privileges enjoyed by the brahmanas will be set out at one place.88

The position of ksatriyas and their relation to the brah maṇas falls to be considered now. First of all with reference to the king several important passages may be cited. In some Cases rājan' means only a noble' or 'chief', as in Rs. X. 42. 10, X. 97. 6. In many passages rājan' means 'king'. The government often seems to have been tribal, such tribes as Yadus, Turvabas, Druhyus, Anus and Pūrus (Rg. I. 108. 8) being frequently mentioned ( vide Rg. VII. 18. 6 for Bhrgus and Druhyus and VII. 18. 7 for Tștsus, VIII. 6. 46 for Yadvas ). Whether kingship was by election it is not necessary here to discuss. The king was regarded as keeping the people within bounds. When a king was crowned, it was thought that 'a ksatriya was produced, a lord of all beings, the defender of brāhmaṇas (or of holy texts ) and of dharma.''! The Sat. Br. says 'for these two ( śrotriya and king ) are the upholders of the sacred law among men (8. B. E. vol. 41 p. 106 )." That the co-operation between brāhmaṇa and kṣatriya results in glory and success is frequently emphasized e. g. *therefore a brāhmaṇa must certainly be approached by a ksatriya who is about to perform some act, for indeed that act of & kṣatriya which is sped on by brāhmaṇa succeeds (Satapatha, S. B. E. vol. 26 pp. 270-271). The purohita of &

If they had taken tho Tai, S. passago in the sonne in which Dr. Ghuryo takes it they would never have scrupled to day so in smrti works and would have quoted the Tai. $. in support. Henco the moaning is difforent. There is no question here of an Arbitratiou or judicial docision. In Rg.

kṣatriya came to occupy a very high position. The Satapatha (8. B. E. vol. 26 p. 270) lays emphasis on the importance of the purohita and cautions a brāhmaṇa against being the purohita of any king he meets with and adds that a brahmana may remain without a king, but a king should not be without a brahmana. Even the gods required & purohita, as the Tai. S. II. 5. 1. 1. says' Viśvarūpe son of Traṣtr was the purobita of gods. 44 Sanda and Aiarka were the purohitas of the Asuras ( Kathaka S. IV. 4). Agni is often called purohita (Rg. I. 1. 1., I. 44. 10, III. 2. 8). "May we, purohitas, be awake in the kingdom (for its welfare )' says the Tai. 8. (I. 7. 10.1). The Ait. Br. ( chap. 34.8) say895 * the purohita is half the soul of the ksatriya' and contains an eulogy of purohita in the following words ( 40.1 ) " for indeed the gods do not eat the food of a king who has no purohita ; therefore a king when about to offer a sacrifice should have a brāhmaṇa as his purohita with the idea 'may the gods eat my food."" The combination of the brāhmaṇa and the rājanya is said to be most desirable and that it is conducive to the eminence of both is declared in the Tai. S. (V. 1. 10. 3 )86 . Therefore a brāhmaṇa who is supported by a rājanya is superior to another brālmana (not so supported ), hende a rājanya who has a brāhmana ( to help him ) is superior to another rājanya'. The Satapatha ( V. 4. 4. 15 ) deolares that king indeed who is not powerful to the brāhmaṇas ( i. e. who is humble before the brāhmaṇas ) becomes more powerful than his foes.'97 It is not to be supposed that this attainment of the supreme position by brāhmapas was an affair of plain sailing. Sometimes kṣatriyas claimed higher position and also paid scant respect to brahmaṇas. In the Satapatha we read 'whence the brahmana is an object of respect after the king'( S. B. E. vol. 41, p. 96 ); hence the people here serve, from a lower po ition, the kṣatriya seated above them' Satapatha (S. B. E. vol. 12 p. 94 ); 'hence when a nobleman approaches, all these people, the subjects crouch down hy him on the ground 'Satapatha ( S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 228 ); therefore there is nothing higher than the kṣatra;

therefore the brāhmana sits down below the ksatriya in the Rajasuya'( Satapatha 14. 4. 1. 23 =Bṛ. Up. I. 4. 11). In the Atharvaveda several verges occur which declare the harm that results from disrespecting or injuring a brābmana or from rob. bing him of his cow. "He who regards brahmana as food drinks of the poison of Taimāta; he who injures & brāhmana, the rela. tive of the gods, does not attain to the world of pitss ( Atharvs veda V. 18. 4 and 13). Those who spat on a brāhmaṇa or those who sent to him muous remain biting the hair in the midst of a stream by their mouth; that kingdom sinks as water sinks a shattered vessel, where they injure & brāhmana; that wicked aot strikes that kingdom * ( Atharvaveda V. 19. 3 and 8). 

The stories of king Kārtavirya and Visvā mitra who respec tively carried off the cows of Jamadagni and Vasistha narrated in the Mahabhārata (Santi 49 for Kartavirga; Ādi. 175 for Viūvamitra ) and the Purāṇas show how several kings were high-handed and treated brāhmaṇas with no respect whatever. It appears that even the wives of brāhmaṇas were not quite safe at the hands of kings. The chamberlain ( kṣat) of that king in whose kingdom the wife of a brāhmana is thoughtlessly put under restraint does not march in front of cooking vessels with a golden ornament on his neok*99 ( Atharva V. 17. 14). The somewhat mystical hymn (Rg. X. 109 ) where 'brahmajāyā' figures prominently probably hints at the same fact (viz. tbe kidnapping of the wives of brābmanas ). 

The Tai. S. says that 'the vaisya indeed sacrifices, being desirous of cattle' and that the gods having been defeated were reduced to the condition of being the vaisyas or 'vis of asuras'; 100 'the vaisya among men, cows among beasts, therefore they are to be enjoyed ( to be eaten, to be subsisted upon) by others; they were produced froin the receptacle of food; therefore they exceed others in numbers, 101 The Tai. Br. says 'the vaibya olags is

said to have been born from pk verses, they declare the Yajur veda as the origin of the ksatriya, the Sāmaveda is indeed the source of brāhmaṇas. 108 The same Brāhmaṇa further says the vis go away from (reside separately from ) the brahmaṇas and ksatriyas'. The Tāṇdya Br. says!"? 'Hence the vaisya, though being eaten ( i. e. subsisted upon) by others is not exhausted, since he was created from the prajanana (from the sexual parts of Prajāpati); therefore he has numerous cattle, he bas all the gods (as his patrons ) and was produced with the Jagati metre, his season is the rains, therefore he is to be eaten by the brābmans and the rājanya, since he was created as lower (than those two classes). The Sat. Br. (S. B. E. vol. 26 p. 335 ) 88ys 'He thus assigns to the Maruts a share tberein after Indra, whereby he makes the people ( vis ) subser vient and obedient to the nobility 5.104 According to the Ait. Br. 35, 3 the vaisya is one who is the food of others, who pays taxes to others. These passages show that vaibyas were entitled to sacrifice, reared cattle, were far more numerous than the other two classes, they had to bear the brunt of taxation, they lived apart from brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas and were 

obedient to them. 

The system of the four varṇas had taken such deep roots in the period when the Brāhmaṇa works were composed, that we often meet with Vedic passages saying that it extended even to the gods, Agni and Bșhaspati being the brāhmaṇas among gods; Indra, Varuṇa, Soma, Yama being the kṣatriyas; Vasus, Rudras, the Viśve Devas and Maruts being the vis, and Pūṣan being the sūdra. 105 Similarly it is said the brāhmaṇa is really spring, the kṣatriya summer, and the vis are the rainy season.'

Varna : various crafts in the Vedas 

medit: * 

bara 

That there were other professions and crafts with specific names ( which in later times at least became castes ) even in the times of the Samhitās is quite clear. The Rg. speaks of vaptā ( barber ) in X. 142.4, taṣtā (a carpenter or maker of chariots ) in Rg. I. 61.4, VII. 32.20, IX. 112.1, X119.5; tvaṣta (a carpenter ) in VIII. 102.8; bhisak (medicine man) in IX. 112.1 and 3, karmāra or kārmāra (iron-smith) in X. 72.2 and IX. 112.2, carmanna ( tanner) in Rg. VIII. 5.38. 

The Atharvavada mentions rathakāra ( III. 5.6 ), karmara (III. 5.6 ) and sūta (III. 5.7). In the Tai. S. (IV. 5.4.2 )106 mention is made of kṣatr (royal chamberlain or doorkeeper), samgrabitr (treasurer), takṣan ( carpenter ) and rathakāra ( maker of chariots ), kulala (potter), karmāra, puājista (fowler), nisada, iṣukst (maker of arrows), dhanvakrt ( maker of bows ), mrgayu ( hunter) and svani ( those who lead packs of hounds ). These also occur in the Vājasaneya-sambitā 16.26-28 and these and a few more in Vāj. S. 30.5-13 and in Kathaka Samhita 17.13. In the Tai. Br. (III. 4.1 and the following anuvākas that deal with Puruṣanedha) we have dyogū, māgadha (bard), sūla, kailūṣa (actor), rebba, bbsmala, ratbakāra, takṣan, kaulala, karmāra, mapikāra, vapa (sower or barber), iṣukāra, dhanvakāra, jyākāra (maker of bow-string), rajjusarga, mrgayu, svani Burākāra ( vintner), ayastāpa (heater of iron or copper), kitava ( gambler ), bidalakāra ( worker in wicker-work ), kantakakāra. The Satapatha Br. XI, 8.1. speaks of kaulala-oakra (the potter's wheel). The Tai. Br. III. 8.5, mentions also rājaputra ugra. The Satapatha (S. B. E. Vol. 44 p. 397) speaks of Marutta Avikṣita as an ayogava king. This latter is a pratiloma caste according to the dharmasutras (vide below). Whether in the Satapatba that word has the same sense is doubtful. The Tai, 8. I. 8.9.1-2 mentions among the ratnas' (the jewels ), the sūta, grāmaṇi, kṣats, samgrabit?, bhāgadugha ( collector of taxes ), akṣāvāpa ( superintendent of gambling). Vide also Tai. Br. I. 7.3. In the Tāṇdya Brāhmaṇa (19.1.4 ) it is said that ' eight brave persons hold up the kingdom viz. the king's brother, the king's son, the purohita, the crowned queen, the sūta, the grāmapi, kṣats and samgrabit?'. Therefore it looks likely that kṣat; and samgrabitf were high officers of state and not castes. In the Sat. Br. XIII. 4. 1. 5 among the

guards of the horse let loose in the Agvamedha there were a hundred sons of kṣātr&-samgrabitrs carrying olubs'. As the word 'kṣātra' is prefixed to samgrabitr' it follows that 'samgrabitrs' were officers who may have belonged to any varṇa. In the same passage inention is made of a hundred guardians who were the sons of sūtagrāmanis. In another passage of the same brāhmaṇa ( XIII. 2.2.18) the sūtas and grāmanis are said to be no kings and yet are rājakt (i. e. king-makers ), 107 This means probably that they are the prinoipal persons on wbose support the king depends. The Sat. Br. V. 4. 4.15-19 arranged brāhnapa, king, king's brother, sūta or sthapati, grāmani, sajāta in a descending soale of powerfulness. So the sūta appears to have been originally an important officer. It is hardly possible to say with assurance that all tbese had become petrified into castes in the modern sense, particularly when several persons associated with these in the Vaj, S. and elsewhere were not castes such as the thief ( taskara ), the impotent ( kliba ), humpbacked ( kubja ), dwarf ( vāmana ); but most of the avocations and crafts referred to above have corresponding castes and subcastes for hundreds of years. It is therefore possible to say that in the times of the Samhitas and Brāhmaṇas these were groups founded on oocupations that had become castes or were in process of developing into castes. The Tāṇdya Br. speaks of Kirātas ( who were and are non-Aryan and were abori ginal tribes ). 108 The Vāj. . (30. 17 ) speaks of Paulkasa in connection with bibhatsā ( nauseating filth ) and of cāṇdāls ( in 30.21 ) in connection with yāyu ( wind). The paulkasa and capdāla oocur in Tai. Br. (III. 4. 14 and III. 4. 17 (respectively). In the Chāndogya Up. (V. 10.7 ) 108 the cāndala is ranked with the dog and the boar.

III. 8.2. In the Br. Up.

Here ugras seem to be a group of nobles subordinate to the king. In later literature ugra is the offspring of a ksatriya from a $ūdra woman (Yāj. I. 91 ). In the Rg. X. 97, 12 the word ugra ocours "You destroy disease just as an ugra who is a mediator or arbitrator (removes dispute )." What ugra means here cannot be said with certainty. It may only mean a 'formi. dable ohief or king.' 

The rathakāra and niṣāda deserve a passing notice. The Tai. Br. I. 1. 4 after stating that the brahmans should conge orate sacred fires in the spring, the ksatriya in summer, the vaikya in autumn, ordains that the rathakāra should consecrate sacred fires in the rainy season. The question arises whether the rathakāra is a member of the three higher castes who has taken in economio distress to the profession of making chariots or is a person belonging to a caste other than the three higher varpas. Jaimini in bis Purvamimaisi-sutra (VI. 1. 44-50) discusses this question and establishes" that the rathakāra is a member of & oaste other than the three higher varṇas, that he has on account of the express words in the śruti the privilege to consecrate sacred fires with vedio mantras, that the mantra for the consecration of rathakāras is ';bhūṇāın tvā' (Tai Br. 1. 1. 4) and that the rathakāras are the caste called Saudhanvand which is neither sūdra nor one of the three higher ones, but is slightly inferior to the three higher varṇas.

Yaj. I. 10 ) notices that in some smsti the rathakara though not belonging to the three higher varpas, was allowed the privilege of upanayana, but adds that this dictum of the smrti is due to mistake, it being misled by the fact that he is allowed the privilege of adhāna 113 ( consecration of sacred fires ). In modern times the members of the carpenter caste in certain parts of the Deocan at least are in the habit of performing the upa. nayana and wearing the sacred thread. 

With reference to an isti offered to Rudra & Vedic text says 'one should make a niṣādasthapati perform this iṣti.' The Pārvamimañsā sūtra 114 (VI. 1, 51-52) discusses the question whether this authorises a nisāda who is himself a chieftain or a chieftain (who is a member of the three higher varṇas) of niṣadas. The established conclusion is that the iṣti is to be performed by a niṣāda who is & chieftain though he be beyond the pale of the three varmas, as the Karmadbāraya compound is the proper way of dissolving the compound and not the genitive Tatpuruṣa. The Ait. Br. (37.7) says 118 'just as the niṣadas, or selagas (thieves) or evil-doers seize a wealthy man in a forest and throwing him in & well run away with his wealth.' The Sāṅkhāyana Br. ( 25. 15 ) allows one who had performed the Viśvajit sacrifice (in whioh everything is given away ) to stay in & settlement of niṣadas whose food is the lowest that he is allowed to take. The Katya yanaśrauta-sūtra (I. 1. 12-14) says 118 that the chieftain who is & niṣada can offer & caru of Gavedbuka corn to Rudra, but this offering is to be made in ordinary firo ( and not in the fires consecrated with Vadio mantras ) i. e. the permission to offer Raudra iṣti does not entitle him to perform Vedic consecration of fire ( &dbāna ).

The Aitareya Brahmana 118 narrates that Vigvamitra oursed his senior fifty sons, when they did not agree to his pro posal to treat Sunah epa ( Devarāta ) as his son, that they would associate with the lowest castes and that they became the Andhras, Puṇdras, Sabaras, Pulindas and Mūtibas who are among the lowest of society and are mostly composed of dasyus. It is probably owing to this legend that the Manusmrti 11' (X. 43-45 ) is prepared to regard the Paupdrakas, the Odras, Dravi. dag, Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Cinas, Kirātas, Daradas and Kbaśas as being originally kṣatriya castes, but later on reduced to the position of sūdras by the non performance of Vedic saskāras (like upanayana) and by the absence of contact with brāhmaṇas. Manu further adds that the various castes that are outside the ( influence of the ) four verṇas are all known &8 dasyus whether they speak the language of Mlecchas or of Aryas. 

One very important question is whether the theory of the four varṇas with their peculiar privileges and duties desoribed in the dharmasūtras and other smrtis was merely a theory even in the most ancient times. When the Purusasūkta of the Rg veda speaks of Brāhmaṇa, Rājanya, Vaibya and Sadra or when the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa expressly says that they are four Varnas, it appears to me that they speak of facts existing in their times and not merely of a theory which was to be striven for as an ideal. Smrti writers try to place all their diota in the frame-work of the varṇas because the four varṇas and their duties and privileges had been more or less clearly defined in the times of the Vedas and Brābmaṇas, which according to the authors of the smṛtis were sruti, eternal and infallible. They tried to approximate the state of society existing in their times to the varṇas which they held were of hoery antiquity. But there is nothing to show that the same difficulties were felt by the authors of the Vedic hymns and the Brāhmaṇas. The manner in which they refer to the privileges and disabilities of the several varṇas have such a deep ring of actuality that one must concede that the varṇas spoken of in them represented the

real divisions of sooiety at least to a very great extent, if not cent percent. 

The preceding discussion renders the following propositions most probable ; 

(1) that in the earliest times about which we have literary records there were only two varṇas, the āryas and their opponents the dasyus or dāsas; that the difference between the two was based on difference of colour and oulture and was thus more or less racial and cultural; 

(2) that centuries before the samhitā period closed the dasyus had been conquered and were given a position subservi ent to the aryas ; 

(3) that the sūdras were the dasyus so subjugated and made subservient ; 

(4) that the spirit of exclusiveness and pride of superio rity existing among the Āryas with reference to dasyus soon extended to groups among the āryas themselves; 

(5) that by the time of the Brāhmaṇa Literature, brahmanas (men supposed to be devoted to learning and priest hood), kṣatriyas (kings, noblemen and some warriors ) and vaiøyas ( the artisans and common people ) had become sepa rated into groups more or less dependent on birth and that the brahmana 10 had come to be regarded as superior to the kṣatriya by the fact of birth ; 

(6) that even such low castes as cāpdāles and paulkasas had been evolved long before the end of the Vedic period ; 

(7) that owing to cultural advance, division of labour arose and numerous arts and crafts bad been developed and they were in process of contributing to the complexity of the system by creating numerous sub-castes based upon occu pations ; 

(8) that besides the four varṇas intermediate castes like the rathakāra had been evolved ; 

(9) that there were certain non-Aryan tribes which were supposed to have been originally ksatriyas but fallen later on. 

120. That this theory of four yarpas was well-known to Buddhist litorary works is shown by Fick cbap. II. p. 17 (the only differenco being that in the Buddhist works tbe kpatriya is put first and the brshmaga after him).

The close of the Vedic period is here taken as being not later than about 1000 B. O. How much earlier it may be placed it is not possible to gay. 

The following is a list of persons engaged in professions and orafts, which had probably become castes or were in the process of becoming castes, before the close of the Vedic period, as seen from the Vaj. S., Tai, S. and Tai. Br., Kāthaka Sam. (17. 13 ), the Atharva-veda, the Tāṇdya Br. (III. 4.), the Ait. Br., the Chāndogya and the Bș. Up. The meaning of some of the words is not quite olear and it is possible that some in the list were not at all castes or professions. They are arranged in the alphabetical order of Sanskrit (though transliterated). The meanings of most of them have been given above. Where the meaning is doubtful a question mark has been made,

Several centuries before the Christian ere there were Beveral castes. This follows not only from the dharmasūtras but also from the ancient Buddhist works and from the meagre existing fragments of the work of Megasthenes on India. Though Megasthenes was confused in his statements about the caste system as prevalent in his day, some propositions are clearly deducible therefrom. He states (pp. 40 ff) that the whole population of India was divided into seven castes, (1) philosophers, (2) husbandmen, (3) neatherds and shepherds, (4) artisans, (5) military, (6) overseers, (7) councillors and assessors. Out of these 1 and 5 correspond to brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas, 2-3 to vaisyas, 4 to śūdras; 6th and 7th correspond to adhyakṣas and amatyas (as in Kautilya's Arthasastra ) and are not really castes but occupations. He probably regards them as castes because the offices of the adhyakṣas and amatyas were generally hereditary or at least he gathered that they were so. Megasthenes' further statement (pp. 43-44 ) that no one is allowed to marry out of his own caste or to exeroise any calling or art except his own' shows that the prevailing tendency was that casto had become exclusive and mostly occupational in bis day, though there must have been excep tions of which he was not informed. 

The ancient writers on dharmasastra strive very hard to account for the bewildering ramifioations of the caste system from the four yarpas that were spoken of in the śruti (revela tion). There is unanimity on the theory that the numerous castes actually found in the country arose from the unions of males of different varṇas with women belonging to varṇas differing from their own. The divergences (and they are

many) among the several smrtikaras relate only to details. The smrti writers had before them the hoary theory of four Varpas youched for by infallible Vedic authority, but they were at the same time quite cognizant of the realities in society viz. the separate existence of numerous castes and Bub-castes that had varying claims es regards social status and that were based in popular estimation on birth alone. Therefore, when one criticizes the smrti view of the derivation of numerous castes from the mixture or confusion ( sankara ) of the four varṇas as purely hypothetical and imaginary, the critioism is true only partially. The smrtis were composed in different parts of India at different times and they were meant to supply a popular want, to guide the people and to reflect the prevailing state of society and popular feeling. Therefore, it must be admitted that the numerous castes mentioned in the smptis did exist at the time of the smṛtis, that the social status of the several castes might have varied from country to country or from epoch to epoch, that the peculiar avocations and means of livelihood assigned to the various castes reflected the real state of things. The element of hypothesis and speculation lies only in the theory of a partioular sub-caste having sprung from the union of two persons belonging to two partioular varṇas or castes.121 This description of the origin of the several castes was only indicative of the suthor's view or of the accepted view about the social status of those castes in particular looalities. There is here, as a inatter of fact, great divergence of views among the several authors. 

In the first placa all writers on dharmagāstra start with the propositions viz. (1) that the four varṇas, brahmana, ksatriya, vaisya and sūdra, are arranged in a descending scale of social status ; and (2) that marriage is or was permissible between a male of a higher varpa with a woman of a lower varpa, but the union of a woman of a higher varng with a male of varpa lower than her own is reprehensible and not permitted. Thero is a third proposition advanced by many writers that a man belongs to a particular varṇa or jati by birth only i. e. if born in lawful wedlook of parents both of whom belong to that varpa

or jati. 18 This is the view held by all medieval writers and digests and it is expressly said that a man belongs to a caste by birth and no actions of his can alter that fact, that several castes are like the species of animals and that caste attaches to the body and not to the soul (vide Sūtasambita ). When & male of a higher varṇ& marries & woman of a lower varṇa, the marriage is said to be anuloma ( lit. with the hair, in the natural order) and the offspring is said to be anuloma ; when there is a union of a woman of a higher varṇa with a male of a lower Varpa, it is said to be pratiloma ( against the bair, i. a. against the natural or proper order) and the children of the union are said to be pratiloma. These two words anuloma and pratiloma ( as applied to marriage or progeny ) hardly ever occur in the vedic literature. In the Bș. Up. (II. 1. 15 ) and Kausi taki Br. Up. IV. 18 (quoted in note 89 above ) the word * pratiloma' is applied to the procedure adopted by a brāhmana of going to a kṣatriya for knowledge about brahman. From this it may possibly be inferred that pratiloma and anuloma might have been employed with reference to marriages also ( in the days of the Upaniṣad). Panini ( IV. 4. 28 ) teaches the formation of words from anuloma and pratiloma. They occur in Gautama (IV. 14-15 ), Baud. Dh.S.( I. 8. 8), Vasiṣtha ( 18.7), Manu ( X. 13), Yāj. (1. 95 ) and other smrti works. 

One important question is whether the theory of anuloma or pratiloma castes presupposes a marriage or only a union ( outside marriage) of & man and a woman. The Ap. Dh, S. (II. 6. 13. 1, 3-4) lays down 123 that a man must marry a virgin of his own varṇa with the rites prescribed by the sāstras and only the son born of such a marriage is entitled to the privileges and occupation of his father, that sexual intercourse with a woman who has been married by another or on whom the proper ceremonies of marriage are not performed or who

Ch. II] Varna : anuloma and pratiloma castes belongs to another caste is condemned and that the son (and not the daughter ) born of such an union is condemned (through the sin of the parents ). So Apastamba looked with disfavour even on marriages called anuloma. He is entirely silent about anuloma and pratiloma castes. It is no doubt true that most ancient writers like Gautama ( IV. 1), Vasistha ( I. 24), Manu (III. 12-13), Yaj. ( I. 55 and 57 ) prescribe that & person should by preference marry a girl of his own varṇa but also allow the marriage of a person with a girl of apother varṇa lower than his own. Yāj. (1.92) expressly says that the six anuloma castes, mūrdhāvasikta, ambaṣtha, niṣāda, māhiṣya, ugra, and karana are so called only when they are the offspring of women married by men of higher varpas. Manu (X. 41 ) says that the six anuloma castes are entitled to the rites ( Bamskāras like upanayana ) performed for dvijas, but that the pratiloma castes are like sūdras (i. e. even when a pratiloma oaste springs from a brābmana woman and a ksatriya or vaibya male they cannot have upanayana and other rites of dvijas performed for them, though both parents are dvijas ). Kautilya 184 (III. 7 ) also says that all pratilomas except cāndalas are like sūdras; Viṣṇu says that they are condemned by all Aryas. Devala's ( quoted by Parabara. madhaviya I. 2. p. 122 ) says that pratilomas are outside the pale of the system of varṇas and are patita. The Smrtyarthasāra p. 13 Axys that anuloma sons and those born of the mūrdhāvesikta and other anuloma castes are dvijātis and are entitled to samskāras as dvijātis. Commentators like Kullāka (on Manu X. 11 ) say that, as no marriage is legally possible between a woman of a bigher varpa and a male of a lower varpa, all the pratilomas are born outside lawful wedlock, Gautama (IV. 20) says that all pratilomas are dharmahina, which is interpreted by the Mit. on Yaj. III. 262 as meaning that they cannot have upana yang and similar samskāras of drijas performed for them, though they are amenable to the rules of morality and entitled to perform vratas and prāyascittas. Vasiṣtha, Baudhayana and several others do not make it olear whether, when they speak of pratilomas, they contemplate offspring of legal

marriages or only of illegitimate and adulterous unions. But it will be seen from the list appended below that Uśanas and Vaikhanasa almost always make a distinotion between the caste assigned to the offspring of the union of parents of different varpas, according as there is a marriage between the two or it is only a clandestine, illegitimate or adulterous union, For example, Uśanas says 18 that when there is a marriage between a ksatriya male and a brāhmapa female, the offspring is oalled gūta, while the offspring of a clandestine union between a brāhmaṇa woman and a ksatriya male was called rathakāra. So these two authors held that there could be a legal marriage when & woman of a higher varpa married a male of a lower yarpa. 187 There were several other works like the Sūtasamhita (Śivamāhātmyakbanda chap. 12. 12-48) where a similar distinction is made between the children of marriages and clandestine unions. The Mit, on Yāj. I. 90 says that such progeny as kunda and golaka (Manu III. 174), kānina, saho dhaja ( who are all not due to intercourse in wedlock) are different from savarpa, anuloma and pratiloma and are to be treated as sūdras and that the kṣetraja son is to be treated as in a different category (since niyoga is allowed by the smrtis and by the usage of sistas ) and belongs to the caste of bis mother. Aparārka ( on Yāj. I. 92 p. 118 ) does not accept this view and holds that even kanina and sahodha may be held to be brāhmaṇas (if the begetter can be proved to have been a brāhmaṇa ); while Viśvarūpa on Yāj. II. 133 says that kanina and gūdhaja must be deemed to belong to the mother's caste as the begetter may not be known and that sahodhaja ( II. 135) is also to be so treated. These several kinds of secondary sons will be treated under inheritance. 

A few words must be said about the word jāli. The idea of varṇa was as we have seen based originally on race, culture, cha. racter and profession. It takes account mainly of the moral and intellectual worth of man and is a system of olasses whioh appears more or less natural. The ideal of varṇa even in the smstig lays far more emphasis on duties, on a high standard of effort for the community or society rather than on the rights and pri vileges of birth. The system of jātis (castes) lays all emphasis on

birth and heredity and tends to create the mentality of clinging to privileges without trying to fulfil the obligations correspond ing to such privileges. The word "jāti' in the sense of caste hardly ever occurs in the vedic literature. In the Nirukta 128 (XII. 13) it is said 'after agnicayana (the building of the fire altar), 8 man should not approach & rāmā (for sexual intercourse ); rūmā is so called because she is approached only for pleasure and not for ( 8ccumulation of ) merit; she is of a dark caste'. Here the word krsnajātigā ocours with reference to a woman of the sūdra caste. Almost these very words occur in Vasiṣtha (18. 17-18 )129 where for krsna jatiya the word kropavarṇā is substituted. Viśvarūpa on Yāj. I. 56 ( yad-ucyate sto. )130 quotes these words as a brāhmapa text, but there the word is krsnavsrply. Therefore, the use of the word jāti in the sense of caste can be traced back at least to the times of the Nirukta. Pāṇini (V. 4. 9 )131 teaches the formation of words like 'brahmanajātiya' derived from words ending in 'jāti' (in the sense of caste). The expression 'jātidharma' (rules of castes ) oocurs in Gautama XI. 20, Vasiṣtha I. 17 and XIX. 7, Manu I. 118 and VIII, 41 and the word jāti (caste ) ocours also in Āp. Dh. S. II. 3. 6.1, II. 1.2.3, Manu (IV. 141, X, 11, 18, 40, 97 ), Yāj. (I. 95, 361, II. 69, 206, III. 213), Nārada (rpādana 288 ) and in the vārtika on Pānini IV. 1. 137. Varna and jāti are sometimes clearly distinguished as in Yaj II. 69 and 206. But very often they are confounded. In Manu X. 27,31 the word varṇa is used in the sense of mixed castes (jatis ). Conversely the word jāti often appears to be used to indicate 'varṇa 'Vide Manu III. 15, VIII. 177, IX. 86 and 335, X. 41 and Yāj. I. 89 ( in which latter sajāti appears to mean'savarṇa'). 

Even when anuloma marriages were allowed there is no unanimity among the sages and the smrtis as to the status of the progeny of such unions. Three different views are found. The first view is that if a male of one varṇa married a female of the varpa immediately after it, the progeny belonged to the varṇa

of the father; e. g. Baud. Dh. 8,184 (I. 8.6 and I. 9. 3) says that sons born to a person of a savarpa wife or a wife of the varpa next to his own are savarṇa i. e. the son of a brāhmaṇa from & wife of the ksatriya varṇa is a brāhmaṇa. The Anusasang parya 48. 4, Nārada (stripuīsa 106 ) and Kautilya (III. 7) gay the same. Gautama IV, 15 as interpreted by Haradatta appears to say that the off-spring of a brāhmaṇa from a kṣatriya wife is called savarṇa, but not the offspring of a ksatriya male from & vaibya wife or of & vaisya male from & sūdra wife. Fick (pp. 54-57 ) shows that even according to the Bbaddasāla Jataka 'the family of the mother does not matter; the family of the father alone is important'. The second view is that the progeny of anuloma unions is in status lower than the father, but higher than the mother; e. g. Manu X. 6 'sages declare the sons begotten by dvijas on wives of varpas immediately next to theirs as similar ( to the fathers, but not of the same varṇa with the fathers ) but tainted by the inferiority of their mothers.' The third view (and this is the common view ) is that the progeny of anu loma marriages is of the same varṇa as regards its privileges and obligations as the mother's; e. g. vide Viṣṇu Dh. S. 16. 2 188 and Saṅkha (prose) quoted by the Mit, on Yāj I. 91 and Apararka (p. 118 ). A classical echo of this view is found in the Sakuntala of Kālidāsa where king Duṣyanta exclaims aside to himself 'would that this girl were born of the sage from a wife who was not savarṇa'. Medhātithi on Manu X, 6 says that Pandu, Dhstaraṣtra and Vidura being kṣetraja sons took the caste of their mothers. The Mit, explains the words of Saṅkha by saying that the offspring of anuloma marriages such as mūrdhāvasikta are not really different from kṣatriyas, that they have the same saṁskāras but they do not become kṣatriyas etc. and are dubbed by these names to indicate their mixed origin and come to form separate sub-castes. The pratilomas, as said above, are lower in status than any of the two parents.

Varna and the enumeration of castes 

The ancient dharmasūtras mention only a few mixed castes. Ap. Dh, S, mentions only cāṇḍāla, paulkasa and vaipa. Gautama names five anuloma castes, six pratiloma, one and eight others according to the view of some. Baudhāyana adds to those mentioned by Gautama & few more viz rathakira, śvapaka, vaiṇa and kukkuṭa. Vasiṣtha names even a smaller number than Gautama and Baudhāyana. It is Manu ( X) and Viṣṇu Dh. 8. (XVI) that for the first time dilate upon the avocations of the mixed castes. Manu refers to 6 anuloma, 6 pratiloma and 20 doubly mixed castes and states the avocations of about 23; Yaj. names only 13 castes (other than the four Varpas). Usanas names about 40 and gives their peculiar avocations. All the smrtis taken together hardly mention more than about one hundred castes. 

The number of primary anulomas is only six ( vide Manu X. 10, Yaj I. 91-92), but Manu names only three of them, vis. ambastha, niṣāda and ugra. The primary pratilomas also are six ( vide Manu X. 11–12 and 16-17 and Yāj. I. 93–34 ) viz sūta, vaidebaka, cāṇdāls, māgadha, kṣats, and dyogava. Further sub-castes are said to arise from the unions of the anulomas and pratilomas with the four varṇas and of the male of one anuloma and the female of another, from the union of pratilomas among themselves and from the union of a male or female of an anuloma caste and the female or male of a pratiloma caste. For example, Yāj. I. 95 defines rathakāra as the offspring of a māhiṣya male and a karana female, i. e. it is a further mixture between two anuloma oastes. The Mit. on Yāj. I. 95 says that upanayana and other sainskāras are performed for the offspring of anuloma persons marrying among themselves. The Smrtyarthasāra (p. 13 ) says the same's. Similarly Manu X, 15 says that avśta and abbira spring from the union of a brahmana with an ugra girl and an ambaṣtha girl respectively ( i. e. from the union of a brābmana with anuloma caste girls ). Manu X. 19 says that syapāka is the offspring of a kṣatṛ male (a pratiloma) with an ugra female (an anuloma ). Manu X 33 defines maitreyaka as the offspring of a vaidehaka male and an dyogava female (i.e. from parents who are both pratiloma). A

(Oh. II 

smrti verse quoted 128 by Viśvarūpa on Yaj. I. 95 says that there are six anulomas, 24 doubly mixed castes ( due to the union of the six anulomas with the four yarpas ), 6 pratilomas and 24 doubly mired castes (due to the unions of 6 pratilomas with four varṇas ) i. e, in all 60 and further mixtures of these among themselves give rise to innumerable sub-castes. Similarly Viṣṇu Db. 8. 16.7 137 says that the further mixed castes arising from the unions of mixed castes are numberless. This shows that before the time of the Viṣṇudharmasūtra (i, e. at least about 2000 years ago) numberless castes and sub-castes had been formed and the writers on dharmasastra practically gave up in despair the task of deriving them, even though mediately, from the primary varṇas. The same state of things Wag continued and was rather aggravated by the time of the nibandhakāras. Medhātithi on Manu X. 31 speaks of 60 mixed castes along with the four varṇas and adds that by the inter mingling of these endless sub castes are formed. The Mitakṣara 188 on Yāj. I. 95 observes that since the castes spring ing from the double intermingling of varṇas are innumerable, it is impossible to describe or enumerate them. Similarly the Kṛtyakalpataru in its prakirnaka topic of vyavahāra section, when dealing with castes, merely quotes several passages from the smrtis and does not add a word of its own about the castes, their names or avocations in its own day (first half of 12th century ). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 94139 expressly says that the avocations of the pratilomas (about which Yaj. is silent) should be understood from the smśtis of Usanas and Manu. Medieval writers on dharmaśāstra usually ignore the treat ment in detail of the numerous sub-castes and content themselves with dilating upon the duties of the four varpas. 

There was great diversity of opinion among the smrtikāras about the derivation and status of the several sub castes. We find that the same subwoaste is known under five or six different names even so early as the present Manusmrti.

Varna and sub castes 

59 

Manu X. 22 gives seven names for the same caste and Manu X. 23 gives five for another. Vibvarūpa on Yāj. I. 92 explains that these different names are due to difference of locality." There is another difficulty. The same name given to & oaste is differently derived by different writers ( vide under niṣada and pārasava below). For the same sub-caste different names are given in different smṛtis (vide under krta and rāmaka). It beoame difficult to assign any peculiar derivation for groups of people and so Manu (X. 40), Vasiṣtha161 ( 18.7) and Anuśāsana parva 148. 29 laid down that men's sub-caste was to be known from their actions and ocoupations. This shows that according to most writers castes in the times of the smrtis were predominantly occupational, 

One word that frequently occurs in connection with castes and sub-castes is varṇasankara ( or only sarkara ). In Manu X. 12 and 24 the word varṇagamkara is used in the plural in the sense of mixed casteg, wbile in Manu X 40 (and in V. 89) the word sankara seems to be used in the sense of 'mixture or intermingling of Varnas'. Gautama (VIII. 3) employs the word saṛkara and says 'on the two ( the brābmana and the king ) depends the prosperity of men), protection, the prevention of mixture (of varṇas ) and the ( accumulation of merit (or the observance of dharma ).148 Narada ( stripuṁsa 102 ) 13 says ' to be born from a union in the inverse order of Varnas amounts to varyasankara;' while Bphaspati quoted in the Kr̥tyakalpataru appears to apply the word varpasarnkara to both anuloma and pratiloma casteg. Baud. 14* Dh. $. (I. 9. 16 ) says that those who are born of

Varnasamkara are called vrūtyas, The Mit. on Yaj I. 96 applies the word varṇasamkara to both anuloms and pratiloms progeny. Medhātithills on Manu V. 88 says that the word ' samkarajāta' indicates pratilomas like āyogava and that even though as regarda anulomas there is intermingling (of varṇas ), yet as they have the privileges of the caste of their mothers, even Manu himself does not apply the word samkirnayoni to them as been above ( Manu X. 25). Yama'46 quoted in the Kityakal. pataru says 'Varnagarkara arises by the violation of the res trictions ( about marriage); if the proper order of varṇas ( i. e. male of higher varṇa marrying a woman of a lower varṇa) is followed, (the offspring) is entitled to be regarded as belonging to the system of varṇas, but if the reverse order is followed it is sin.' Manu ( X. 24 ) says 'mixed castes arise by members of one varṇa baving sexual intercourse with women of another varṇa, by marrying women who ought not to have been married (such as & sagotra girl) and by neglect of the duties peculiar to one's varṇa'. The Anuśāganaparve 48. 1148 remarks that 'varṇasamkara arises from wealth, greed, desires, unoertainty about the varpa ( of a person) or ignorance about varṇa', Even in such & philosophical treatise as the Bhagavad-gita ( I. 41-43 ), it is said 'when women become corrupt (or demo ralised ), intermingling of varṇas arises ; saṁkara necessarily leads the whole family and the destroyer of the family to hell. By reason of these transgressions of the destroyers of families which bring about varṇasamkara, the ancient casto observances and family observances are subverled.' 

On account of the great emphasis laid on the prevention of varṇasaṛkara the smrtis ordain that it is one of the principal duties of the king to punish people if they transgress the rules prescribed for varṇas and to punish men and women if guilty of varṇasımkara. Gautama (XI. 9-10) says the king should protect the varṇas and āārainas according to the gāstras and be should make them conform to their duties when they swerve

from them;' Vasiṣtha (19, 7-8) 'the king paying attention to all these viz. the observances of countries, castes and families should make the four varṇas conform to their duties and should punish them when they go astray'; Viṣṇu Dh. 8. III. 3 and Yaj I. 361, Mārkandeyapuārṇa 27, Matsyapurāṇa 215. 63 say the same. Nārada ( stripuasa 113 ) 148 says * when & brāhmaṇa woman goes astray a cāṇdāla is born from a sūdra male (and the brāhmaṇa woman); therefore the king should specially protect women from sarkara'. It is on account of this that so early as in the first centuries of the Christian era we see that king Vasithiputa Siri Pulumāyi is extolled as having prevented the mixture of the four varṇas ( E. I. vol. VIII pp. 60-61, 'vinivatitacātuvaṇa-sakarasa ). That Varnasamkørs had gone too far in the opinion of the author of the Mahabharata (Vanaparva 180. 31-33 ) follows from the following words which are despairingly put in the mouth of Yudhisthira 149 "It appears to me that it is very difficult to ascertain the caste of human beings on account of the confusion of all varṇas; all sorts of men are always begetting offspring from all sorts of women; speech, sexual intercourse, being born and death-these are common to all human beings; and there is scriptural authority (for this view) in the words 'We, who ever we are, offer the sacrifice'. Hence those who have seen the truth regard character as the principal thing desired." Samkarācārya in his bhāṣya on Vedantasūtra I. 3. 33 remarks that, though in his day varṇas and asramas had become disor ganised and unstable as to their dharmas, that was not the caso in other ages, sinoe otherwise the kāstras laying down regulations for them would have to be deemed purposeless or futile.150 

Gautama (IV. 18-19), Manu ( X, 64-65 ) and Yāj. (I. 96 ) speak of a paouliar doctrine called Jūlyutkarṣa and Jūtyapakarṣa. These passages have given rise to some divergence of interpreta

tion, but their general sense is clear. Gautama (IV. 18 ) 151 says that according to the Scāryas the anulomas when they marry in such a way that the bridegroom in each stage is higher or lower than the bride they rise to a higher or go down to & lower varpa in the 7th or 5th generation ( respectively ). This is explained by Haradatta as follows: When a brāhmapa marries a kṣatriya woman the daughter born of this marriage is called savarnā; if this latter is married to a brāhmaṇa and & daughter is born and this latter is again married by a brāhmaṇa and if this continues in the same way for seven generations, then when the 7th girl in descent marries & brahmana, whatever child is born of that union belongs to the brāhmaṇa varṇa (though in the preceding generations only the fathers were brāhmaṇas and the mothers were all not strictly brāhmaṇas, but only savarnās if at all). This is called jālyutkarṣa (rise in status as a caste). On the other hand, when a brāhmaṇa marries a kṣatriga girl and a son is born who is called savarṇa, then that son marries a kṣatriya girl and has a son and this is continued for five generations, then when the fifth son (in descent ) marries a ksatriya girl, the child born belongs to the ksatriya varpa (though in all the preceding generations the father was higher than kṣatriya and the mother only was a kṣatriya). This is jātyapakarṣa ( fall in status as a caste). The same rule holds good as regards a kṣatriya marrying a vaisya female and e vaisya marrying & sūdra female. The same rule applies among anulomas also e. g. if a savarṇa (as defined by Gautama ) marries an ambagtha girl and a daughter is born who again marries & savarṇa and this continues for seven generations, then the child of the 7th girl ( in descent) from a savarṇa male becomes & savarṇa ( rises in status); on the other hand if a savarṇa ( offspring of brāhmaṇa male and kṣatriya female ) marries an ambaṣtha girl and & son is born and that son marries an ambaṣtha girl and their son marries an ambaṣtha girl and this goes on for seven generations, then the child of

Though this method makes a good sense it is opposed to the explanation of Haradatta, who explains that the option allowed by the use of 'v&' in the sutra applies only where there is pro-ominonco of cbaracter and lourning (i. e. in such a capo riso is possible oven in the 5th geboration )

the 7th male (in descent ) born of an ambastha wife becomes an ambaṣtha ( i. e. there is jātyapakarga as to anulomas ). 

According to Manu'58 X. 64 when & brāhmaṇa marries & sūdra woman, the daughter born is pāraśava, and if this pāraśava daughter marries & brāhmaṇa and the daughter of this latter union marries a brāhmaṇa and this continues for seven generations, then the seventh generation will be a brahmana ( i, e, there will be jātyutkarṣa ), Conversely, if a brāhmaṇa marries & sūdra woman and a son is born, he is & pārasaya and that son marries & sūdra woman and their son again marries a sūdra woman and this goes on for 7 generations, the 7th generation becomes a mere sūdra ( there is jātyapakarṣa ). It will be seen that this differs from Gautama in several respecte. In the first place for both jātyutkarsa and jātyapakarṣa seven generations are prescribed, while in Gautama they are 7 and 5 respectively (according to Haradatta). In the second place according to Gautama the 8th in descent from the first anuloma marriage secures jātyutkarṣa, while according to Manu, the 7th secures it. Further Manu is silent about jātyutkarsa when the original parents are anulomas. Besides, the commentators of Manu shorten the period for rige or fall in jati as stated below. Manu X. 65 extends the game rules to the offspring of the marriage of a kṣatriya with a vaisya woman and of a vaibya with a sūdra wonian, Medhātithi and Kullūka extend these express words of Manu further by explaining that if a brahmana marries a vaisya female and a daughter is born and she again marries & brahmana then in the fifth generation there will be jātyutkarṣ& ; conversely if & son is born from a brāhmaṇa and a vaibya wife, and he marries 

162. The word "yuga ' is understood by Medbātitbi (on Madu X. 64) and Kullaka to mean "jadma'; Sarvajõ&-Dūrūyaga understands it to moan 'yugma' (pair of spouses ). The meaning (yugina ) is attached to 'yuga' by A parārka on Yoj. I. 96 (p. 119). In the S. B. E. vol. II p. 196 Dr. Bobler compares Āp. Dh. $. II. 5.10. 10-11 with Gautama IV. 22. But the great scholar is not accurate here, Ap. does not speak of progeny of mixed marriages rising to higher status or being degraded to lower status after several generations ; he rather spoaks of . $Odre rising bigher and higher in successive births. In the Anugasana parva (chap. 27. 5-6, 28. 6-13) it is said that after numberless births sūdras and others beooine vaidyas and 80 on. Vana parva (212. 11-12) gives expression to the samo iden सपोमो हि जातस्म सगुणाहपतिष्ठतः। श्यत्वं लभते बान क्षत्रियत्वं तथैव च। भाजी dari ponsel werf 212. 11-18.

a vaibya female and this goes on, then in the fifth generation the son will be & vaibya (1. e. there will be jātyapakarsa ) Similarly if a brāhmaṇa marries a kṣatriya woman then there is jātyutkarga or jātyspakarṣa in three generations. 

Yajñavalkya ( I. 96 ) 158 speaks of two kinds of jātyrutkarṣa or jūlyapakarṣa viz. one due to marriage (as in Manu and Gautama) and another due to the avocation followed. It should be understood that there is rise in caste in the 7th or even in the 5th generation; if there is inversion as to the avocations, then there is corresponding similarity (of varpa in the 7th or even 5th generation). This is elaborated by the Mitakṣarā as follows: If a brahmana marries a śūdra woman and a daughter is born she is a niṣādi; if this latter marries a brāhmaṇa and a daughter is born and she in turn marries a brāhmaṇa and this goes on for six generations, then the child of the 6th girl (in descent ) becomes a brāhmaṇa ( he being 7th in descent); similarly if a brāhmaṇa marries a vaibga woman and a girl is born, she is an ambaṣtha ; if the latter marries a brāhmana and a daughter is born and this goes on in the same way, then the fifth girl in descent has a child ( from a brābmaṇa husband) which is the 6tb in descent from the original anuloma marriage and which then becomes a brāhmaṇa. If a brāhmaṇa marries & ksatriya woman and a daughter is born who is called mūrdhāvasiktā (Yāj. I. 91 ) and she marries a brāhmaṇa, then the fourth in descent marrying a brāhmaṇa has a child (5th in descent), then that child becomes a brābmana. Similarly, if a kṣatriya married a śūdra female and a daughter was born, she was called ugra, then jātyutkarsa by marrying a higher male took place in the 6th generation, If & ksatriya married a vaiśya woman, the daughter born was a mahiṣya and jātyutkarṣa took place in the 5th generation, If a vaiśye married a sūdra woman, the daughter of the marriage is & karani and if she marries & vaisya, then in the fifth generation there would be jātyutkarṣa. Certain peculiar avocations and activities are prescribed for the four varpas, Each varṇa may in times of difficulty follow the ocoupation peculiar to the caste immediately below it, but should not follow the avocations peculiar to the higher varṇas ; 184 he must however revert to his proper avocation when the difficulty is

over (vide Vasistha II. 13-23, Viṣṇu Dh. 8. II. 15, Yaj. I. 118-120, Gautama X. 1-7 &c.). If a brāhmaṇa begins to follow the avocations peculiar to a sūdra and has a son, who does the same and this goes on continuously for seven generations, the 7th becomes a sūdra (by caste ). If a brābmana begins to follow the avocations peculiar to a vaibya or a kṣatriya then in the 5th or 6th generation respectively there is fall in oaste (i,e, the 5th or 6th becomes respectively a vaisya or ksatriya). Similarly if a kṣatriya follows the avocation of a vaisya or sūdra and this goes on continuously, then the 5th or 6th (respectively ) becomes a sūdra or vaisya. Similarly if a vaisya takes to the work peculiar to sūdras, then the fifth generation becomes sūdra, 

Baud. 355 Dh, 8. ( I. 8. 13-14) gives another illustration of jātyutkarṣa. He says "if a niṣāda (the son of a brāhmann from & sūdra wife) marries & niṣādi (and this goes on continuously ), then the fifth generation becomes free of the taint of a sūdra status, he can have upanayana performed for him and his son (6th from the original niṣāda pair) can have a vedio sacrifice performed for him.' 

These provisions would considerably lessen the rigour of the caste system based purely on birth. But one feels grave doubts whether such a method of jātyutkarṣa or jatyapa karṣa (particularly the one based on ocoupation) was or could be ever enforced in actual life. It would have been impossible to remember descent in a particular way for five or seven genera tions. The want of unanimity among the original smrtikāras and the commentators also points in the direction that the method advocated, though it might have originally some slight basis in fact, was only a hypothesis and an ideal. Hardly any examples of jātyutkarsa in the way set out by Manu or Yaj. ooour in the literature on dharma-sāstra or in insoriptions. In the inscriptions we have authentic cases of intercaste marriages only, but hardly anything further 18. From the Talgunda pillar inscription of king Kakusthavarman of the Kadamba family we learn that the Kadambas were originally of brāb maṇa lineage, that the founder of the family was & brāhmana

Mayurasarman, who became exasperated with the Pallavas of Kāñcipura and took up the sword to conquer the earth, that his descendants applied the affix 'Varman' to their names (as if they were ksatriyss, according to Manu II. 32) and Kakustha Varman (4th in descent from Mayurasarman) married his daughters to Gupta and other kings 187. This shows that an originally brāhmaṇa family came to look upon itself as ksatriya by virtue of pursuing the profession of arms and governing the people. In the Mahabhārata we meet with stories of kings who became brālmaṇas. For example, Anugasana 30 speaks of Vitahavya, a king, as having become a brāhmaṇa; similarly Salya ( 39. 36-37) speaks of Aratisena, Sindhudvipa, Devāpi and Viśvāmitra as having become brāhmaṇas at a sacred spot on the Sarasvati. In the Purāṇas also there are stories 158 of kings like Viśvāmitra, Mandhātā, Samkṣti, Kapi, Vadhryasva, Purukutsa, Arstisena, Ajamidha and others as having risen to the status of brāhmaṇas. These are mythical sages and their rise is not stated to have been due to the prin ciple of jātyutkarṣa 159. Ibbetson (Report on the census of the Punjab 1881, pp. 174-176) notes that brahmanas following certain professions became degraded and that the caste was changed. 

That the professional castes were wealthy and well organized follows from the dharmaśāstra works and epigraphic records. In this connection the words śreni, pūga, gana, vrāta and sangha deserve to be carefully studied. All these were called samūha (group) or varga according to Kātyāyana.160 These

words ocour in the Vedic literature, but the sense is generally ' a group' and there is no special meaning attached. "Srepi' occurs in the Rg. I. 163. 10 161 (like flamingoes the horses press forward in rows or groups ); both vrāta and gaña occur in Rg. III. 26. 6, V, 53. 11 and in numerous other places. The Kausi taki Br. 16.7 16% speaks of Rudra as pūga ( as he is the hoad of the band of Maruts). Ap. Dh. . I. 1. 3. 26163 quotes a Brāh. mana passage about a group (sangha ) of brabmacārins going about for alms. Pāṇini teaches 184 the formation of derivatives from pūga, gana, sangha (V. 2. 52), from vrata (V. 2. 21 ). In his time it appears the words had acquired specific meanings. The Mahābhāṣya explains ( on Pāṇini V, 2.21 ) that vrātas are groups formed by men of various castes with no fixed means of livelihood but subsisting by the might (or strength ) of their bodies (by bodily labour of various kinds). The Kāśika185 explains pūgas as associations of men of different castes with no fixed professions, who are solely bent on making money or seeking pleasure, Kautilya in one place distinguishes between soldiers and bropis ( guilds ) and in another place says that the guilds of kṣatriyas in Kambhoja and Surāṣṭra subsist by the profession of arms and vārtā ( agriculture ).188 Vas. Dh. 8. XVI. 15 says that boundary disputes are to be settled by the evidence of the old men in the village or town or of guilds (śreni) when there is conflict of documentary evidence. Viṣṇu Dh. S. V. 167 prescribes banishment for him who embezzles the wealth of associations ( gaña) and who transgresses the conventions made by them. Manu (VIII. 219 ) has a similar rule about village and local associations (sangha). The above words are variously explained by the several commen

Katyāyana says 'Naigama is an association of citizens of the same city, vrata is a company of soldiers carrying various arms, pūga is an association of traders and the like, gana is a group of brahmaṇas, sangha is & body of Bauddhas or Jainas; and bands of oāndalas and kvapacas are called gulma.' Yāj. ( I. 361 ) directs the king to punish kulas, castes, āreṇis, ganas, if they tranggress their rules (of conduot or business) and the Mit, explains sreṇi 88 a guild of sellers of betel leaves and the like and gaña &8 of 'helabukas' (horse-dealers ); while Yāj. II. 192 and Nārada 188 ( samayasyānapākarma ) require the king to prevent the breach of the conventions of frepi, naigama, pūga, vrata, gana and to confirm them in their traditional occupations. Yāj. II. 30 says that pūgas and trenis had authority to investigate dis putes and that the pūga was a higher tribunal than the froṇi. The Mit, on this explains that pūga is an association of people of diffe rent castes and different occupations that stay in one locality, while a froṇi is a group of people of different castes, that subsist by the occupation of one caste and gives 'hedabukas' tambū. likas' (betel sellers ), ' kuvindas '( weavers ) and 'carmakāras (shoe-makers ) as examples of sreṇis. In the Harṣa stone of Chabamāna Vigraharāja (E, I. vol. II. p. 124) there is a reference to one dramma for each horse given to 'hedāvikas.' In the Nasik Inscription No. 15 (E. I. vol. VIII p. 88 ) we are told that in the reign of the Abhira king Iśvarasena 1000 karṣāpaṇas were deposited with an association of potters as a permanent donation yielding interest, 500 with a guild of oilmen and 2000 with a guild of watermen ( uda ka-yantra-sreṇi ) for medicines to be given to sick bhikṣus. No. 9 and No. 12 of the inscriptions at Nasik also contain reference to deposits of money with the guild of weavers. The Mathurā Brahmi insoription of Huviśka's reign mentions a guild of flour-makers ( sam itakara, vide E. I. vol. 21 p. 55 at p. 61). The Junnar Buddhist cave Inscription (A. 8. W. I. vol.

Similarly it is said that a guild of silk weavers from Lāṭa (southern Gujerat ) caine to Dajapura ( Dasor in Malwa ) and built a temple of the sun in the Mālava year 494 i. e. 437-38 A. D. (O. I. I. vol. III p. 81 = I. A, vol. 15 p. 194). These examples show that about the first centuries of the Christian era such castes as woodworkers, oilmen, betel sellers and weavers that are at present very low in the hierarchy of castes had very efficient caste guilds, so famous for their organization, integrity and stability that people deposited with them thousands for permanent services to objects of charity, 169 

We shall now append a list of several castes enumerated or mentioned in smrti and other dharmaśāstra works from about 500 B. C. to 1000 A. D. in alphabetical (Sanskrit) order. They are not given in a tabular form owing to numerous contradictory statements in the smṛtis themselves. References are given only to a few smrtis, the principal ones drawn upon being the Dharmasūtras, Manu, Yaj., Vaik. smārta-sutra X 11-15, Uśanas, the Sūtasambita (Śiva-mahatmya-khaṇda obap. 12). It is hoped that the list is fairly exhaustive for the smrti period. It will be noticed that many of the caste names collected here still occur under the same forms or under slightly modified forms of the names. 

Andhra. Vide above note 118 quoting the Ait. Br. Manu X. 36 says it was a low subcaste sprung from Vaidehaka father and Kārāvara mother and that Andhras were to live outside the village and to subsist (X. 48 ) by killing wild beasts. In the edicts of Asoka the Andhras ara associated with Pulindas ( vide Rook Ediot No, 13). The Udyogaparve ( 160. 103 ) mentions Andhras (probably as people of Andhradeśa ) along with Dravidas and Kāñoyas. In the Nālanda plate of Devapāladeva (E. I. vol. 17 p. 321 ) meda, andhraka apd cāndala are spoken of as the lowest oastes. In Orissa one scheduled caste is noted as Adi-Andhra ( vide Sob. O.O. 1936 ).

Antyaja. This word is applied to all lowest castes like the cāṇḍāla in Manu IV. 61, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 36.7, Yāj. I. 273, Bșhad yama ( quoted in Mit. on Yāj. III. 260). In Manu VIII. 279 the word is used in the sense of sūdra'. Various enumerations of the subdivisions of antyajas are found in the smṣtis. Atri 199 enumerates! BOVER antyajas viz. rajaka (washerman ), carmakāra ( worker in hides ), nata (dancer caste, represented in the Deccan by Kolhātis ), buruda ( worker in bamboos ), kaivarta (fisherman ), meda, bhilla. This verse is quoted as Āpastamba's by the Mit. on Yāj. III. 265, while Apararka p. 1123 asoribes it to Atri. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 260 distinguishes between two groups of antyajas, viz. the one quoted above which it says is not so low as another group of seven, which are called antyāvasūyins, 171 viz. cāṇdāla, śvapaoa (eater of dog flesh ), kṣats, sūta, vaidehika, māgadha and dyogave. In the Mahābhārata (Santi 101. 19 ) reference is made to antyaja soldiers and Nilakantha explains that they were the kaivartas and bhillas of the border regions. According to the Sarasvati. vilāsa (p. 74) Pitāmaha speaks of the seven castes of rajaka and others as prakstis.178 Is it possible that the Prākṣta languages were originally so called because they were spoken by these castes called prakṣtis? In the Sangamner plate of Bhillama II dated sake 922 (E. I. vol. II. p. 220 ) a village is granted with eighteen prakstis ( meaning probably the eighteen guilds of washermen and others ). The Viramitrodaya ( vyavahāra p. 12 ) explains that froṇis mean the eighteen low castes such as the rajaka. This shows that these low castes had risen in social status in the medieval ages by their organization and

Antāvasāyin or Antyāvasāyin. Manu IV.79 separately mon tions'antyas' and 'antyāvasāyins' and Manu X. 39 says that the antyāvasāgin is the offspring of & oāṇdala male from a nisāda female, that he is condemned even by all 'bāhyas' (untouchables ) and stays in a cemetery. Gautama 20.1 and 23, 32 mentions "antyā vasāyin (and -yini). Vas. Dh. S. 18. 3 holds that the antyāvasāyin is the offspring of a sūdra from a vaibya woman. The Bhāradvāja-srauta sutra (XI. 22. 12) forbids the study of the Veda in the presence of the antyava sāyin. The Anusasana-parva ( 22.22) epeaks of Medas, Pulkasas and Antāvasāgins (the printed text is corrrupt). Sānti (141. 29-32) gives a graphic description of a hamlet of cāṇdālas and calls them 'antyāvasaya' (in verse 41 ). Nārada (rpādāna 182 ) says that an antyāvasāyin is not eligible as a witness. Some modern works like the Jātiviveka (D.O. Ms. No.347 of 1887-91) gay that Doin in inodorn times is the antyāvasāyin of the smstis.

In Ait. Br. (chap. 39. 7) king Ambaṣthya is said to have performed an Aśramedha saorifice. In Pāṇ. VIII. 3. 97 the word Ambastia is derived and on Pān. IV.1.170 Ambaṣthya (king ?) is cited by Pat, as an example derived from Ambaṣtha (& country ). It is a question whother the oaste of Ambaṣthas derived its name froin a country. Karnaparva (6. 11) mentions a king Ambaṣtha. In Baud. Dh. S. I. 9. 3, Manu X. 8, Yāj. I. 91, Usanas 31, Nārada ( stripumsa v. 107) Ambaṣtha is an anuloma sprung from the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a vaibya woman, while according to Gautama 4. 14 as interpreted by Haradatta he is the offspring of a kṣatriya from a vaisya woman. Manu X. 47 prescribes the profession of medicine for him and Uśanas 174 ( 31-32 ) says that he may subsist by agriculture or may be a fire-dancer or he may be a herald (? banner proclaimer)

Ayaskāra ( blacksmith ). In the Vedic literature we have Ayastāpa (heater of ayas, probably any metal ). Vide under karmakara and karmāra. Patañjali on Pāṇ. II. 4. 10 mentions him as a sūdra along with taksan (Mahābhāṣya, vol. I. p. 475). 

Avarita. Devala quoted by Aparārka (p. 118 on Yāj. I. 92) says that he is born of the illegitimate connection between a married woman and a male of the same caste and he becomes & sūdra. The Śūdra-kamalakara 175 (p. 247) cites from the Smpti kaumudi a verse of the Adityapurāṇa to the same effect. 

Avira. According to the Sūtasamhita he is the offspring of & clandestine union between a kṣatriya male and a vaisya female. 

Apita. According to the Sūtasamhita he is the offspring of brāhmaṇa from a Daugyanti. 

Abhira. According to Manu X. 15 he is the child of the union of a brāhmaṇa with an ambaṣtha girl. The Mahabhārata ( Mausalaparva 7. 46-63 and 8. 16-17) states that the abhiras were dasyris and mlecchas who attacked Arjuna after the great war in the land of the five rivers and carried away Vrobi women. The Sabhāparya (51.12 ) mentions abhiras with Pāradas and the Aśvamedhika ( 29. 15-16 ) says ( just as Manu X. 43-44 do ) that the Abhiras, the Dravidas and others became kūdras by non-contact with brāhmaṇas. The Mahābhāṣya expressly states that the abbiras are not & subcaste inoluded under the genus sūdra but that they are a caste distinct from sūdras. 176 The Kamasutra (V. 5. 30) names an abhira king Kottarāja.

in pootry. The Amarakoba says that they are cow-herds and that the abhfre wife of a Mabasūdra is called Abbirl. The Abbiras became absorbed in Hindu society and we find that an Abbira senāpati Rudrabbūti in the year 103 (181-82 A. D.) under king Rudrasimha, son of Rudradāman, built a well (E. I. vol. 16 p. 235 ) and in the Nasik cave No. 15 there is an inscription of king Isvaradena, a son of Abbira Śivadatta and Madhari ( i. e. the mother was of the Mathara gotra ). Vide E. I. vol. 8. p. 88. Abbiras are called ahirs in modern times. Vide J. B, B. R. A. S. vol. 21 pp. 430-433, Enthoven's Tribes and castes of Bombay' vol. I. p. 17 ff. 

Ayogava. Vide Ayogū above (p. 43) from Vedic literature. According to Gaut. IV, 15, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 16. 4, Manu X. 12, Kauṭ. III. 7, Anuśāsana 48. 13, Yaj. I. 94 this is a pratiloma caste sprung from the union of a sūdra male and a vaisya female; while Baud. Dh. S. (I. 9.7), Uganas 12, Vaik, X. 14 say that it springs from the union of a vaisya male and & ksatriya female. Vas. Dh. 8. (18,3 ) gives antydvasāyin as the name of the caste sprung from a śūdra male and a vaisya female and pulkasa as the name of one sprung from a vaisya male and s ksatriya female. His avooation (Manu X 48) is to pare wood, while Uśanas ( verse 13 ) says he is a weaver or subsists by making vessels of bronze or by cultivating paddy or by dealing in cloth. According to Viṣṇu Dh. S. 16. 8 and Agnipurāṇa (151. 15 ) he is to make his living by going to the stage. The Sahyadrikhanda says ( 26. 68-69 ) that he works in stones and brioke, makes pavements and whitewasheg walls i. e, he is the modern Pātharvata ( in the Deccan). 

Avantya. Same as Bhūrjakantha ( Manu X. 21). 

Afrika. According to Vaik. X. 12 he is the child of a olandestine union betweon & ksatriya male and a vaisya female and deals in horses. 

Ahindika. According to Manu X. 37 he is the offspring of a niṣada male from a vaidehi female i. e. he is a double pratiloma oaste. Kullaka says that his avocation according to Uśanas is to prevent strangers from trespassing on places where offenders are kept imprisoned. Manu X. 36 shows that the same caste is called Kārāvara when it follows the oraft of a oarmakāra. 

Ugra. For Vedic reference see above (p. 45). According to Baud. Db. S. (I. 9.5), Manu X,9, Kauṭ. III.7, Yaj. I. 92, Anuśksana 48, 7 be is an anuloma offspring of a ksatriya male from a būdra

woman, while according to Uśanas ( verse 41 ) he is the offspring of the union of a brāhmaṇa with a sūdra woman. The Ap. Dh.8. (I. 2. 7. 20 ) allows a pupil to bring wealth from a sūdra or an ugra when the teacher is in distress or diffioulties. Gaut. 4. 14 ( as explained by Haradatta ) says that ugra is the offspring of & vaisya from a gūdra female. The Ap. Dh. 8. ( I 6. 18. 1 ) says that a brāhmaṇa may accept the gift of money, corn like paddy, flesh of deer, house, field, hay for oxen from an ugra. Manu X. 49 says that the ugra should subsist by oatching and killing animals that hide in holes, while Usanas ( verse 41 ) states that he is to be the staff-bearer of the king and to carry out the punishments inflicted on offenders. Vide Vaik, 10. 13. According to the Sahyadrikhanda and Sūdrakamalakara (p. 255 ) he is called 'Rajpūta'. In the Jātiviveka ( the D. O. collection of 1887-1891 No. 347 ) he is called Rāvut. 

Udbandhaka. Acoording to Ubanas (verse 15 ) he is the offspring of the union of a sūnika and a kṣatriya woman, subsists by washing clothes and is an untouchable. Vaik. 10, 15 says he is the offspring of a khanska and a kṣatriya woman. 

Upakruṣta. According to Asv. śr. sutra (II. 1) he does not belong to the dvijātis, but is authorised to perform the vedic rite of agnyādheya and the commentary explains that he is a vaisya following the profession of a carpenter. 

Odra. Vide Manu X. 43-44. Odra is a country correspond ing more or less to modern Orissa. Most of the names of people mentioned in Manu X. 44 are derived from countries. Vide note on Khasa (p. 79) and see Sabhāparva 51, 23. 

Katakāra. According to Usanas ( 45 ) and Vaik, 10, 13 he is the offspring of a clandestino union between & vaibye and & sūdra female, 

Karana. According to Gaut. (IV. 17 the view of some Acāryas) and Yaj. I. 92, he is the child of the marriage of & vaisya and a sūdra woman (i. e. he is an anuloma ). Manu (X. 2% ) says that a ksatriya who is & vrātya (i. e. for whom no upanayana has been performed ) has from a similar woman & child variously called Jhalla, Malla, Nicoivi (Licohivi?), Nata, Karana, Khaba, Dravida. Adiparva 115. 43 tells us that Dhstarāstra had from & vaisya female a karana son named Yuyutsu, Kṣtrasyāmi on Amara says tbat karapa also denotes a group of officers like kayasthas and adhyakṣas (superintend ents). The Sahyadrikhanda (26. 49-51 ) says he is the same as

Karmakāra. Viṣṇu Dh. 8. (51. 14) montions this oaste. It is most probably the same as karmārs. But Saṅkha ( prose ) quoted by Aparārka p. 115 separately mentions in the same passage karmakāra and karmāra, 

Karmāra. For vedio references vide (p. 43) above. This caste appears in the gapa kulaladi (Pān. IV. 3. 118). Manu IV. 215 mentions it. In Bengal the Lohar is & scheduled caste ( vide Sch. O.O. 1936 ).

Kamboja. Vide Manu X. 43-44. The oountry of Kamboja was known to Yaska ( Nirukta II. 2) and Pāṇini ( IV. 1. 175 ). Udyogaparva 160. 103, Droṇa 121. 13 mention Kambojas with Sakas. Vide under Yavana. 

Kayasthan 17Heated controversies have røged in medi. eval and modern times about the origin and status of kāyasthas and the bitterness is refleoted in the decisions of the Indian courts also. In Bholanath v. Emperor178 the Caloutta High Court held that the kāyasthas of Bengal were sūdras and went so far as to hold that a kayastha could marry & Dom female. But in Asita Mohan v. Nirode Mohani7s the Privy Counoil left open the question whether the kāyasthas of Bengal were sūdras. On the other hand in Tulsi Ram v. Bihari Lal180 and in Ishwari Prasad v. Rai Hari Prasad181 the Allahabad and Patna High Courts respectively held that the kāyasthas were dvijas and not sūdrag. In Subrao v. Radha 52 Bom. 497 at p. 504-506 this conflict of decisions is referred to. . The word kayastha does not ooour in the anoient dharma. sūtras of Gautama, Apastamba, Baudhāyana, or Vasiṣtha nor

In the Manusmrti. The Viṣṇu Dh. 8. VII. 3 defines a publio dooument (rajasaksika) as one written in the royal court or office by a kayastha appointed by the king and attested by the hand of the superintendent of the office. 188 These words suggest that the kāyastha was an officer and that there is nothing about a oaste here. Yāj. I. 322 calls upon the king to protect the subjects from the harassment of cātas ( rogues ), thieves, bad characters, desperadoss and the like and partioularly of kāyasthes. The Mit. explains that kāyasthas are accountants and soribes, are favourites of the king and very cunning. Usanas 188 ( 35 ) holds the kāyasthas to be & caste and gives an uncomplimen tary derivation of the name by saying that it is compounded of the first letters of kaka (orow), Yama and sthapati to convey the three attributes of greed, cruelty and the spoliation (or paring), characteristio of the three. The Veda-Vyāga sost1184 ( 1. 10-11) includes the kāyastha among sūdras along with barbers, potters and others. Sumantu quoted in the Par. M, II part I p. 383 makes the food of & lekhaka along with that of oilmen and others unfit for a brahmanaloLekhaka is obviously a caste here, but whether it is the kāyastha caste is doubtful. Bphas pati as quoted in the Smptioandrika ( vyavahāra ) speaks of the ganaka and lekhaka as two persons to be associated with a judge in a court of justice and says they were to be dvijas. Vide also Aparārka p. 600. Therefore both these were only officers and not members of a particular caste. In the Mșochakaṭika (Act IX) & breṣthin and kāyastha are associated with the judge. So the kāyastha seems to be the same as the lekhaka of Bphaspati and as a mere offioial. In the first centuries of the Christian ere the kdyastha was merely an officer and the word was possibly derived from or is & Sanskrit approximation of some foreign word for an officer, though in some parts of the country (as shown by Ubanas and Veda-Vyāsa ) the kāyasthas also had come to form & oaste in medieval times.

Varna: kāyastha 

Though numerous officers are mentioned in the inscriptions of the first five or six centuries of the Christian era, the kāyastha hardly ever figures among them. One of the earliest inscrip tions where the word kāyastha ocours is the Kanaswa Inscription of Śivagana dated in the Mālava era 795 (i. e. 738-39 A, D.). Vide I. A. vol. 19 pp. 56 and 59. See also E. I. vol. X. p. 79 for Kayastha Kāñoana in Balera plates in 994-95 A. D., E. I. vol. XI. p. 149 for Śāsanika kāyastha in Naraspatam plates of 1045-46 A. D., E. I. vol. XI. p. 20,25 for kāyastha Surāditya who was 'Sarvaśkstravit'in Govindacandra's plate dated 1129-30 A. D., E. I. 19 pp. 209, 213 Amodā plate dated 1161 A. D. (for Vāsta vya kāyastha ), E. I. vol. 19 p. 45 Inscription of Hammira ( dated 1288-89 A. D. ), E. I. XII. P. 46 ( dated 1328-29 A. D. for Mathura kāyastha), E. I. 20 Appendix No. 442 p. 64 ( for Gauda kayastha ). In the Rājatarangiol ( VIII. 131 ) kāyasthas and diviras are mentioned separately and in VIII. 2383 it is stated that the brāhmana Śivaratha, who was a roguish kayastha, was strangulated in the reign of Jayasimha. So in the 12th century kayasthas were only officers in Cashmir and brāhmaṇas held such offices. Vide Rājatarangini V, 180-184 for a bitter diatribe against kāyasthas. 

The Śūdrakamalakara (pp. 279-280) speaks of three sub castes of kāyasthas. 

Kārāvara. According to Manu X. 36 he is a doubly mixed oaste sprung from the union of a niṣāda with a vaidehi and his oraft is that of a carmakāra. According to later digests like the Śūdrakamalakara he is called 'kabāra' or 'bhoi' and holds torches and carries umbrellas for others. 

Kāruṣa. According to Manu X. 23 this caste springs from the union of a vrātys vaisya and a similar female. This caste is also called Sudhanvācārya, Vijanman, Maitra and Satvata (according to Manu ). 

Kirāta. Vide above (p. 44) for vedio references. Veda-Vyāsa speaks of him as a subdivision of sūdra ( note 184). According to Manu ( X. 43-44) he is a kṣatriya reduced to the status of a sudra. Anuśāsana (35.17-18 ) says the same about Mekalas, Dravidas, Latas, Pauparas, Yavanas and others. Karnaparva 73. 20 speaks of kirātas as men of fiery valour. Asvamedhika 73. 25 shows that Arjuna met kirātas, yavanas and Mleochas when proceeding to the north with the Aśramedha horse. The Amarakoha says that kirāta, dabara and pulinda are subdivi sions of Mlecoba castes, 

178 



( Ch. II 

Kukkuta. According to Baud. Dh. 8. I. 8. 8 he is a pratiloma oaste, but I. 9. 15 says that he is the child of the union of a sūdra with a niṣada woman, while I. 8. 12 states that he is the offspring of a vaisya from a niṣada woman. 188 Manu X. 18 agrees with Baud. Db. I. 9. 15. According to Kaut. III. 7 he is the offspring of an ugra male from a niṣāda female. According to Adityapurāṇa quoted in the Sūdrakamalakara he manufactures swords and other weapons and engages in cookfights for the king. 

Kunda. According to Manu III. 174 he is the offspring of a clandestine intercourse between a married brāhmaṇa woman whose husband is living and a brābmaṇa male. 

Kukunda. According to the Sūtasarhitā he is the offspring of a māgadha from a sūdra female. 

Kumbhakara. This word ocours in the gapa kulaladi (Pān. IV. 3. 118 ). Ubanas ( 32-33 ) says that he is the offspring of the clandestine union of a brāhmaṇa with a vaibya female. Vaik. (X 12 ) agrees with Ubanag and adds that the offspring becomes either a kumbhakāra or a barber who sbaves parts of the body above the navel. Veda-Vyāsa (I. 10-11 ) and Devala (quoted in Par. M. II. 1. p. 431 and Gr. R. p. 337 ) include the potter among sudras.187 In the Central Provinces the Kumbhāra is a scheduled oaste. 

Kulala. For Vedic references see above (p.43). Paṇ IV3.118 explains the formation of kaulalakam (made by a potter ). The Aśv. Gr. IV. 3. 18 says that all earthen Vessels (kaulālam) of a deceased agnihotrin should be kept by his son. Why two names arose for the caste of potters it is difficult to explain. 

Kulika. This caste is mentioned in Saṅkha quoted by Aparārka p. 1175 (where Apararka explains it as devalaka ). 

Kusilava. According to Baudhāyana as quoted in the Kṛtyakalpataru he is the offspring of an ambastha from a vaidebaka female. According to Amara he is the same as a carana ( a bard). According to Kaut. (III. 7 ) he is the offspring of a vaidehaka male from an ambaṣtha female ( i. e. exactly the reverse of Baudhayana's view ) and he gives the name vaiṇa to the offspring of an ambaṣtha male from a vaidebaka female.

Kṛta. According to Gaut. IV. 15 he is the offspring of a vaibya from a brāhmaṇa woman. Yaj. I. 93 and others call this caste vaidehaka. 

Kaivarta. In the Assam valley kaibartta is & soheduled caste. Vide under antyaja (p. 70) above. Medhātithi on Manu X, 4 says that this is a mixed caste. Manu X. 34 tells us that the inhabitants of Aryāvarta employ the name kaivarta to denote the offspring of a niṣāda from an āyogava woman, who is also oalled mārgava and dāsa ( dāśa ?) and who subsists by plying boats. Samkara on Vedantasūtra IT. 3. 43 says that dāśa and kaivarta are the same. Fick p. 302 notes that fishermen who work with nets and baskets were called in the Jātakas kevatta. 

Kolika. Mentioned as one of the antyajeg by Veda-Vyāga. Vide note 173 under antyaja. Koli is a scheduled caste in the Central Provinces and Kol in United Provinces. 

Ksats. For vedio references see above. According to Baud. Dh. 8. I. 9.7, Kaut. (IIL 7), Manu X. 12, 13 and 16, Yāj. I. 94, Nārada ( stripumsa 112 ), this is a pratiloma caste sprung from a sūdra father and kṣatriya mother. Manu (X. 49-50) pres oribes for him the same avocation as for ugra and pulkasa. Vas. Dh. S. 18. % oalls him vaiṇa. In the Amarakoga ksatr is given three meanings, a charioteer, doorkeeper and the caste described above. In Chāndogya Up. IV. 1, 5, 7, 8 the word seems to mean only door-keeper. Pān. notices the word (VI. 4.11). The Sahyadrikhanda ( 26. 63-66 ) says that kṣatç is also called niṣada and that he is an expert in catching deer by means of nets, is a forester and kills wild animals, also rings & bell at night to remind people of the hour. 

Khanaka. Aocording to Vaik. (X. 15 ) he is the offspring of an dyogava male and kṣatriya female and lives by digging. 

Khasa or khaba, According to Manu X. 22 this is another name for karapa; while in X. 43-44 he makes the khagas a kṣatriya caste originally but reduced to the status of sūdras by the absence of samskāras and the absence of contact with brahmanas. Vide Sabha. 52. 3, Udyoga 160. 103. 

Guhaka. According to the Sātasamhita he is the offspring of a syapaca from a brahmana female. 

Goja ( or Goda ). According to Uśanas ( 28-29 ) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between a kṣatriys male and female.

History of Dhurmadāstra 



Gopa. Vide note 184. He is the modern Gavli and a kūdrs subcasto. Yaj. II. 48 says that debts contracted by gopa wives must be paid by their husbands as the latter's profession and earnings depend upon them. The Kāmasūtra (1. 5. 37 ) mentions a caste oalled Gopalaka. 

Golaka. He is the offspring of a clandestine intercourse between a brāhmana widow and a brābmapa male. Vide Manu III. 174, Lagbu-Satātapa 105, Sūtasamhita ( Śiva. 12. 12 ). 

Cakri, According to Uśanas (22-23 ) he is the offspring of a clandestine union between & sodra male and a vaibya fomalo and subsists by (selling) oil and oiloakes or salt. He seems to be the same as tailika. Hārita ( quoted by A parārka p. 279 ) mentions him. Acoording to Brabınapurāṇa quoted by Apararka p. 1177 he is one who prosses sesame. According to Vaik. (X. 13) he is the offspring of a secret love affair between & vaisya male and a brāhmaṇa female and engages in the sale of salt and oil. 

Carmakāra. Vide under antyaja (p. 70) above. He is men tioned in many smṛtis like Viṣṇu Dh. S. (51.8 ), Āpastamba ( in verse 9.32), Parāśara (VI. 44). According to Usanas (4), he is the offspring of a sūdra from a ksatriya girl, while verse 21 says that those sprung from a vaidehaka and a brāhmaṇa girl subsist by working on hides. Vaik. (X. 15 ) agrees with this latter. Manu IV. 218 speaks of him as carmāvakartin ( outter of hides). According to several smrtis he is one of the Beven antyajas. According to the Sūtasamhitā he is the offspring of an dyogave from a brāhmana female. This name persists to this day as cambhār (in Western India ) or cāmār in all other Indian provinces. This caste is often spoken of as Mochi (shoe-maker ). Often the moohis are Moslems. This is an untouchable caste and the population of carmakāras in India is very large, In the Bombay Presidency alone they are about two hundred and ninety thousand ( in 1931 ). 

Cakrika. According to Amara he is a person who rings a bell. Kṣirasyāmi says that he announces the king's arrival by ringing bells and that some regard him as the same as vaitalika. According to Saṅkha ( prose ) and Sumantu quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1175–76) cakrika and tailika are separate suboastes. According to Vaik. (X. 14 ) he is the offspring of a love affair between a gūdra male and a vaisya female and his avocation is the sale of salt, oil and oil cakes.

Varna: cāndala 

81 

Candāla (or cāṇḍāla). For Vedic references see above pp. 44-45. Aco. to Gaut. IV. 15-16, Vas. Dh. S. 18.1, Baud. Dh. S. I. 9.7, Manu X. 12, Yāj. I. 93, Anuśāsana 48. 11 he is a pratiloma caste sprung of a śūdra from'a brāhmaṇa woman. He is the lowest among men ( Manu X. 12 ), beyond the pale of religious observances prescribed for the four varṇas ( sarvadharma-babi ṣkṛta, as Yāj. I. 93 says ) and often spoken of in the same breath with dogs and crows (e. g. Āp. Dh. S. II. 4. 9.5, Gaut. 15. 25, Yāj. I. 103 ).188 The word occurs in the kulālādi gana ( Pāṇ. IV. 3. 118). Veda-Vyāsa-smrti ( I. 9-10) says that there are three kinds of cāndalas. viz. the offspring of a sūdra from a brāhmana woman, the offspring of an unmarried woman, the offspring of a union with a sagotra girl. Yama quoted in Par. M. vol. II. part 1 p. 306 says that one born of a person who after becoming an ascetio turns back to the householder's life, one born of a sagotra woman and one who is the offspring of a sūdra from a brāhmaṇa woman are all cāṇdālas. Laghu-Śatātapa ( 59 ) has & similar verse. Manu (X.51-56) says that cāṇdālas and syapacas should have their houses outside the village, vessels used by them cannot be used by others (even after putting them in fire ), their wealth consists of dogs and asses, their clothes should be the garments on corpses, they should take their food in broken Vessels, their ornaments were to be made of iron, they should incessantly roam, they are not to enter towns and villages at night, they have to carry the corpses of persons who have no relatives, they are to be hangmen when the king so orders, they may take the clothes, ornaments and beds of persons that are to be hanged. Uśanas (9-10) says that their ornaments are to be of lead or iron, they should have a leather thong round their neoks or oymbal under their armpits, they should remove the dirt of the village in the first part of the day. According to Viṣṇu Dh. S. 16.11 and 14 their avocation is to be hangmen or to kill those offenders who are condemned to death and cāṇdālas have to stay outside the village and to wear the clothes on corpses. Santi 141.29-32 gives a grapbio description of their hamlet. The classical description of a oāṇdāla hamlet is in the Kadambari of Bāna. In Anuśāsana (29.17 ) Matanga is called & cāṇḍāla because he was born of a brāhmana woman from a barber, 

Fa Hien ( 405-411 A. D.) describes how cāṇdālas had to live apart and give notice of their approach when entering a

town or market place by striking a piece of wood to make themselves known so that a man may avoid them and not come in contact with them (vide 'Record of Buddhist kingdoms' tr. by Legge, p. 43). In modern times cāṇdālas are returned as & scheduled oaste in Madras and Orissa. 

Cina. According to Manu X. 43-44 the Cinas were a ksatriya caste reduced to the status of sūdras. They are frequently named in the Mahabhārata e. g. Sabhā 51. 23, Vanaparva 177. 1, Udyoga 19. 15. 

Cuñicu. According to Manu X. 48 the avocation of Meda, Andhra, Cuñcu and Madgu is to kill forest (or wild) animals, Kullūka says that he is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a vaidehska woman, 

Cucuka. According to Vaik. (X. 13) he is the offspring of the marriage of & vaiśya with a sūdra woman and his a vocation is the sale and purchase of betelnut, betelnut leaves and sugar. 

Cailanirnejaka (or only nirnejaka)-washerman. This occurs in Viṣṇu Dh, S. 51. 15 and Manu IV. 216. It appears that Viṣṇu who separately mentions "rajaka' (in 51. 13 ) distingui. shes between the two, Harita ( quoted in Aparārka p. 279 ) also distinguishes between 'rajaka' (one who dyes clothes ) from 

nirṇejaka' (one who washes clothes ). Very often 'rajaka' means only 'a washerman'(as Amara says ). 

Jalopajivin (subsisting by catching animals in a net) probably the same as & kaivarta. He is mentioned in Harita quoted by Aparārka p. 279. 

Jhalla. Manu X. 22 says that it is another name for Karana and Khasa. In Bengal Jhalo Malo or Malo is returned as a scheduled caste. 

Domba (or Doma) is the same as śvapaca according to Kṣira syāmi on Amara. Parāśara quoted by Aparārka (p. 1197) puts $yapāka, domba and cāṇdāla on the same level. In the Rājatar angini ( V.354, VI. 182, VI. 192 ) dombas are spoken of as untou chables on the same level with cāṇdalas and as following the profession of singers. In Rājatarangini V. 389-394 dombas are spoken of as svapacas. This caste is returned as a scheduled caste in Madras as Dombo, as Dom in Bengal, Bihar and U. P. 

Takṣan or Takṣaka (Carpenter). For vedic references see above (p. 43). He is the same as vardhaki quoted above, under kāyastha. He is mentioned by Manu IV. 210, Viṣṇu Dh. 8.51. 8. According to the Mahabhāṣya on Pān. II. 4. 10 

Ch. II) 

Varna : takṣan 

the takṣan is a sūdra and on the same level with an ayas kāra (ironsmith) and excluded from sacrificial rites. Even 80 early as the Sat. Br. the takṣan was an unboly person ( amedhya ) and his touch made yajñapātras impure ( I. 1.3. 12). Uśanas 43 says that takṣaka is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa female from a sūcaka ( i. e. he is a pratiloma). He must be supposed to be originally different from the rathakāra (vide Tai. S. quoted above p. 43 ) who was allowed the vedic rite of adhūna or probably in the time of the smṛtis the carpenter lost his former status. According to Vaik. (X. 14 )189 the offspring of a brāhmaṇa girl from & cucuka ( sūcaka?) is a takṣaka who is untouchable or a goldsmith or blacksmith or worker in bell-metal. Bṛhaspati names the takṣaka as one whose food a brāhmaṇa could not eat. 

Tantuvāya ( a weaver), also called kuyinda. He is men tioned in Viṣṇu Dh, S. (51. 13) and Saṅkha quoted by Aparārka p. 1175. He is regarded as & śūdra by the Mahābhāṣya on Pāṇ, II. 4. 10 and as excluded from sacrificial rites. 

Tūmbūlika--seems to bave been a caste. Vide Kāmasutra I. 5. 37. Bāṇa refers to his house as stored with spices and betel. 

Tūmropajivin (coppersmith). According to Uśanas (14) he is the offspring of an āyogava from a brāhmaṇa woman. Vaik. (X. 15 ) says the same and calls him tāmra. The Jātiviveka (D. O. No. 347 of 1887-91 ) gives the name as tāmra-kuttaka. 

Tunnavaya (a tailor). He occurs in Manu IV. 214. Acoording to the Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Aparārka p. 1178 ho is the same as sūci (or saucika ). 

Tailika (oilman )-occurs in Viṣṇu Dh. S. (51. 15 ), Saṅkha and Sumantu quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1175 and 1176 ). 

Darada. Manu X, 44 names him. Vide note on khasa above p. 79. Vide Mahābhārata, Udyoga parva 4. 15. 

Daśa (a fisherman). This occurs in an Upaniṣad passage according to Vedānta sūtra II. 3. 43. Veda-Vyāsa (I. 12-13) includes him among antyajas (vide footnote 173). Manu X. 34 says that mārgava, dāga ( dāśa ?) and kaivarta are the same and that he subsists by plying boats. Pāṇ. (III. 4. 73 ) derives the word. Vide under kaivarta.

Divākirlya- ocurs in Mānayagļhya II. 14. 11. According to Amara both oāndāla and nāpita are called divākırti. 

Dauṣmanta. According to Gaut. 4. 14 this is an anuloma caste sprung from the union of a kṣatriya male and a sūdra female. According to the Sūtasambitā the name is Dauṣyanta. 

Dravida. The same as karana, according to Manu X. 22. According to Manu X. 43-44, this is & kṣatriya caste reduced to the status of a śūdra. Vide under khaśa, and Mahābhārata, Udyoga 160. 103, Droṇa 93, 43. 

Dhigvana. According to Manu X. 15 he is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa male from an āyogava female and according to Manu X 49 he subsists by working on (and sale of ) hides. Kullūka on Manu X. 49 quotes a text of Uśanas that Dhige vanas subsist by working on bides and selling them and distin guishes them from kārāvaras. This passage is not found in the printed text of Uśanas. In the Jātiviveka he is styled Mocikāra. 

Dhivara. Same as kaivarts and dāśa, Gaut. (IV. 17 ) indioates that this is a pratiloma caste sprung from a vaisya male and a kṣatriya female ( according to the view of some teachers ). In the Tai. Br. III. 4. 12 Dhaivara, Dāśa and Kaivarta are separately mentioned, but how they were distinguished it is difficult to say. All caught fish in different ways. Dhimar is a scheduled caste in the Bhandara District of C.P. 

Dhvaji (seller of wines mentioned by Sumantu and Harita quoted by Aparārka p. 1176. The Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Aparārka (p. 1177 ) says he is the same as saundika. 

Nata. He is one of the seven antyajas ( vide note 170 above). Nata is a scheduled caste in Bengal, Bihar, U, P, and Punjab. Hārita quoted by Aparārka (p. 279 ) distinguishes between nata and sailūṣa and Aparārka remarks that nata is & specifio oaste, while sailūṣa is one who though not & nata by caste makes a living by going on the stage. Manu X. 22 says that he is the same as karaṇa, khasa (vide note on kbasa p. 79). Pāṇini knew of a Natasūtra composed by Silalin and another by Krśāśva (IV. 3. 110 and 111), but whether the naṭas he meant were so by caste or whether he meant only actors in general is not clear. Vide under rangāvatārin for a quotation from Maitri Up. Probably this oaste is the same as the Kolhātis or Bahu. rūpis of modern times ( in the Decoan) who are dancers, acrobats and jugglers by profession. Fick's work p. 299 speaks 

Ch. II) 

Varna : nata 

of natakakulas mentioned in Buddhist Jātakas and at p. 294 he shows that in the Suruci Jātaka the nata is described as throw ing up a ball of rope and climbing it and performing other trioks of jugglery. 

Nartaka. According to Uśanas (19) he is the offspring of a rañjaka from a vaiśya woman and his profession is that of a singer. Bșhaspati quoted in Par. M. (II. part I p. 380) sepa rately mentions in the same verse nata and nartaka (both being abhojyānna to a brāhmaṇa). Atri VII. 2 also mentions the two separately. See note 189. 

Nāpita (barber). The Sāṅkhāyana gphya I. 25 refers to him (in cūļākarma). Uśanas (32-34) and Vaik. (X. 12) say that he is the offspring of a clandestine affair between a brāhmaṇa male and a vaisya female and Uśanas derives the word by saying that he shaves the body above the navel of & person. 190 Vaik. ( X. 15 ) says that the offspring of an ambastha malo from a kṣatriya female is a nāpita, but he shaves the hair on the body below the navel. Parāśara (XI. 21 ) 101 says that the offspring of & brāhmaṇs from & śūdra girl is called dāsa if samskāras are performed on him, but if they are not performed he be. comes & napita. Pān. (VI. 2. 62 ) specially provides for the accentuation of words meaning artisan ( silpin, like hāpita or kulāls) when compounded with the word grāma. The Sūtasan hitā (Śiva-chap. XII. 15) says that the offspring of the olandestine union of a brāhmaṇa male and a. vaisya female is called kumbhakāra or ūrdhva.Dāpita, while verse 32 says that the offspring of a kṣatriya female from a niṣāda is called *adho-nāpita', 

Nicchivi. Manu X. 22 says that this is another name for karang or khaśa. Probably this is a misreading for Licchavi or Licchivi. Kaut. (Artbaśāstra XI. 1) speaks of the oligarcbies or corporations of Licohivika, Vṛjika, Mallaka '9% etc. Vaigāli was the seat of this oligarchy in the 6th century B. C. (Rapson's 'Anoient India' p. 169 ). Vide Indian Antiquary vol. 32 p. 233 for their Tibetan affinities and I. A. vol. 9 p. 178 and vol. 14 p. 98 for inscriptions of this tribe and Indian Historical

Quarterly,' 1933, vol. 18 p. 439 ff. Fa Hion ( in 'Records of Buddhist Kingdoms' translated by Legge, 1886, p. 71 ) says that the Liochavis of Vaiśāli were attached to Buddha and also speaks of Ananda ( pupil of Buddha) and the Licchavis. 

Niāṣda. For vedio references see above (pp. 43 and 46 ). The Nirukta193 III. 8 wbile explaining the words 'pañcajanā mama hotram juṣadhvam'in Rg. X. 53. 4 remarks that according to Aupamanyava the 'five people' are the four varṇas with niṣāda as the fifth. This shows that Aupamanyava regarded them as distinct from the four varṇas (inoluding the sūdras). The Nirukta further says that according to the Nairuktas the niṣāda is so called because 'sin (or evil) sits down in him'; from this it follows that in the times of Yaska the niṣādas had come to be looked down upon with scorn as evil people and were probably some aborigines like the modern Bhils. Accord ing to Baud, Dh. S. (I. 9.3 and II. 2.33), Vas. 18.8, Manu X. 8, Anuśāsang 48.5, Yāj. I. 91 the Niṣāda is an anuloma caste, offspring of the marriage of a brāhmaṇa with a sūdra woman. Baud. Dh. 8. (II. 2.34), Kuut. (III. 7), Manu ( X, 8) and Yāj. ( I. 91 ) say that pāraśava is another name for niṣāda. Manu ( IX, 178 ) derives pāraśava from the root pūray ( to go across ) and the word $ava ( a corpse) meaning though living he is like one dead'. In a corrupt passage of Vas. Dh. S.194 ( 18. 9-10) the same derivation is accepted. Gaut. (IV. 14 ) distinguishes between niṣāda and pāraśava, the former (aco. to the com. Haradatta ) being the offspring of a brāhmaṇg froin a vaisya woman and the latter being the offspring of a brāhmaṇa male and a sūdra female. According to Nārada (stripumsa v. 108 ) and Anuśāsana 48.1%, niṣāda is the offspring of a kṣatriya male and a śūdra female and he subsists by fishing (acoording to the latter). Nārada ( stripunsa 108 ) says that pāraśava is the offspring of a brāhmaṇa male and a sūdra female. Uśanas ( 36-38 ) says that the offspring of the marriage of & brāhmanx with & sūdra woman is called pārasava and gains his livelihood as the worshipper of the goddess Bhadrakāli or by learning Śaiva agamas or by playing on musical instruments, while niṣāda is the illegitimate offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman who subsists by killing wild beasts (such as elephants ) and by

Varna and niṣāda 

selling flesh. The Vaik. 195 (X. 13 ) has practically the same remarks to make about pāraśava and niṣāda. Sāntiparva ( 59. 96-97) speaks of niṣādas as men with reddish eyes and with black hair. In the Rāmāyana Guha, the king of niṣādas, helps Rāma to cross the river Ganges ( Ayodhyā 50. 33). Here he is spoken of as belonging to the caste of niṣādas ( niśādajātyah). We have historical evidence for the name pāraśava in the Harsacarita (I, towards end ), where Bānaisi tells us that he had with him two pāraśava brothers Candrasena and Mātrṣena in his travels. In the Tipperah copperplate of a chieftain called Lokanātha (about 650 A. D.) we are told that the king's maternal grandfather Keśava was a pāraśava (vide E. I. vol. 15 at p. 307). The Mit. on Yāj. I. 91 cautions that this niṣāda ( the anuloma offspring of a brāhmaṇa from a sūdra woman) is different from another caste called niṣāda, which is a pratiloma one and lives by catohing fish, Medhātithi on Manu X, 8 does the same. Nisāda occurs in the gana kulālādi (Pan. IV. 3. 118 ). The Vāyupurāṇa ( vol. II. chap, 1.120-121) narrates that the nisādas, dark and dwarfish, were produced from the left hand of king Vena and they dwelt on the Vindhya. In the Bhāgavata-purāṇa we have the same story 1 (IV. 14. 42 ff.) and we are told that niṣādas were dark like crows, of short stature, snubnosed, with red eyes and hair and that they dwelt in mountains and forests. 

Pahlava.--occurs in Manu ( X. 43-44) as a ksatriya caste reduced to the status of sūdra. Vide note on khasa. The Mahābhārate geveral times mentions the Pahlavas, Pāradas and other non-Aryan people (vide Sabhā 32. 16-17, Udyoga 4. 15, Bhiṣma 20. 13). 

Pāndusopūka. According to Manu X. 37 he is the offspring of a cāṇdala male from a vaidehaka woman, who maintains him self by dealing in bamboos. He is the same as buruda. 

Pārada. Vide Manu X, 43-44 and note on khasa above. Pāradas are frequently mentioned in the Mahābhārata, generally

49 Mlecobas and non-Aryan tribes ( vide Sabha 32, 16,51. 12, 52. 3; Droṇa 93. 42 and 121. 13 ). Vide under Yavana. 

Pāraśava. Vide niṣāda above. In the Adiparva 109, 25 Vidura is called pāraśava and he is said (in Adi. 114.12 ) to have married the pārasavi daughter of king Devaka. The Sahyadri. khanda ( 26. 43) says that he is called śūdra and is superior to a sūdra ( in status ) and that he was to live by the avocations pre acribed for sūdras. 

Pingala. According to the Sūtasarhitā he is the offspring of a brāhmana from an āyogaya female. 

Pundra or Paundraka. Frequently mentioned in the Maha bhārata among non-Aryan tribes e. g. Drona 93. 44, Āśvame dhika 29. 15-16. Medhātitbi on Manu X, 44 remarks that the Paundrakas aro spoken of as ksatriyas in the Mahābhārata, 80 a man may be misled into thinking that even in the days of Medbātithi they were still kṣatriyas ( but they were not so ). 

Pulinda. For vedic references see above (p. 47). They were & wild mountain tribe like the Kirātas or Śabaras. In the Vana parva 140. 25 Pulindas, Kirātas and Tanganas are spoken of as dwelling on the Himālaya. Udyoga 160. 103, Karna 73. 19-20, Anuśāsana 33. 21-22 mention pulindas. Uśanas (16) says that he is the illegitimate offepring of a vaisya male fron a kṣatriya female and he lives by rearing cattle and by killing wild beasts. Vaik. ( X, 14 ) says the same and adds that he subsists on the produce of the forest and by killing wild animals. The Sūtasambitā is of the same opinion as Vaik. 

Pulkasa ( or paulkasa). The word is also written as pukkase. Samkarācārya on Bṛhadāranyaka Up. IV. 3. 22 days that pulkasa and paulkasa are the same. Acoording to Baud. Dh. 8. (1.9.14) and Manu X. 18 he is the offspring of a niṣāda male from a sūdra female. According to Kaut. (III. 7) be is the offspring of a niṣāda male from an ugra female, while Vaik.

Yama"" and Hārita quoted in the Kștya kalpataru make him out as the offspring of a śūdra male from a vaisya female. Manu X. 49 prescribes catching and killing animals that live in holes as the occupation of kṣats, ugra and pukkasa. Kṣirasyāmi ( com. of Amara ) says that pukkasa is the same as mrtapa (which see below). Āp. Dh. 8. (II. 1. %. 6) says tbat when a Brahmana, Ksatriya or Vaiśya is guilty of the theft of gold, of the murder of a brāhmaṇa, they undergo for some time in hell torments and then are respectively born as Cāṇdāla, Paulkasa or Vaiṇa.

Māgadhes; Anuśāsana X. 48 says that they maintain themselves on speech (i. e. by praise ) and are also called bandin. Sahyā. drikhanda ( 26. 60-62 ) also calls him bandin and says he is slightly superior to śūdra and that he is clever in ornate prose, in six languages, in kalās and he is a devotee of Kālikā. Vaik. (X. 13 ) states that even sūdras cannot take food cooked by him, that he is an untouchable and maintains himself by praise, by singing or by being a messenger. Ubanas (7-8) says that he becomes the bandin of brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas, he maintains himself by lauding (the deeds of others ) or 88 & messenger or servant of a vaisya. Pāṇini IV. 1. 70 derives the word Magadha from the country Magadha, but apparently not 

in the sense of a caste. 

Māṇavika. According to the Sūtasaṁhitā he is the offspring of the clandestine union of a sūdra male and a śūdra female. 

Matanga. The same as cāṇḍāla. The Kādambari of Bana (para 9) and Amara employ them as synonymous. Yama (12) uses the word Matanga where we ordinarily find cāṇāla in other smrtis. In the Bombay Presidency there is an untouchable caste called Māng which numbers about three hundred thousand, 

There are Mangs as a scheduled caste in Orissa.

Mṛtapa. Vide pulkasa above. In the Mahābbāsya' on Pāṇ. II. 4. 10 this caste is mentioned as separate from candāla, but both are included by the Mahābhāṣya under śūdras that are niravasila (i, e. those who are so low in the caste system that if & vessel is used by them for eating their food from it cannot be used by any one of the other castes even after the vessel is purified by fire &o.). 

Meda. He is one of the seven antyajas ( vide note 170 ). This is mentioned in Nārada (vākpāruṣya, verse 11). Anuśāsana 22. 22 speaks of medas, pulkagas and antā vesāyins, and the com. Nilakantha 201 explains that Medas are those who eat the flesh of dead cattle. Manu X, 36 says that he is the offspring of a vaidebaka male and a nigāde woman, that he dwells out side the village and Manu X. 48 says that his business along with that of Andhra, Cuñou and Madgu is to kill wild beasts. Vide under Andhra above and see E. I. vol. XX. p. 130 where meds and capdāla are named as lowest castes in a grant of Paramardideva in samvat 1236. According to Sūdrakamalakara, andhras and medas have to swoop dirty places, doorsteps and privies. 

Maitra. Manu X. 23 says he is the same as Kāruṣa. 

Maitreyaka. According to Manu X. 23 he is the offspring of a vaidehaka male and āyogava female and his means of liveli hood are belauding kings and nobles continually and ringing & bell in the early morning. The Jātiviveka says that he is called Dhokanakāra.

From Striparva 22. 11 it appears that Jayadratha ( king of the countries of Sindhu and Sauvira) had Kamboja and Yavana women in his harem. Pāṇini (IV. 1.59 ) derives the word Yavanāni from Yavana and a vārtika on that sūtra adds that Yavanāni means the lipi ( the written alphabet) of the Yavanas. Patañjali in his Mahābbāsya (on Pān. II. 4. 10) indicates that he was prepared to regard Yavanas and Sakas as sūdras but as outside Arya. varta. Asoka in Rock Ediots V and XIII refers to the Yonas and Kambojas as nations on the borders of his empire. The Viṣṇupurāṇa IV. 3.. 21 describes that the Yavanas shaved the head and also the beard, the Sakas tonsured their heads only, the Pāradas allowed the hair on the head to grow long and the Pahlavas grow beards and that all became Mlecohas because they gave up their original dharmas and because brāhmaṇas also left them. 

Rangāvatārin (or-tūraka ). According to Manu IV, 215 be is distinot from sailūṣa and gāyana. Saṅkha (quoted by Aparārka p. 1175 ), Saṅkha ( 17, 36 ) and Viṣṇu Dh. S. 51. 14 mention him. According to Brahmapurāṇa (quoted by Aparārka p. 1178 ) be is a nata who goes on the stage for livelihood and who introduces various changes in his appearance and dress. Rangāvatārin is mentioned in the Maitri Up. along with nata and bhata.208 

Rajaka (washerman), Dhobi is & scheduled caste in U. P., Bihar and C. P. and in Bengal (called Dhoba). He is one of the antyajas according to several writers ( vide note 170 above). Acoording to Vaikh. (X. 15) and the Sūtasambitā he is the offspring of a pulkaga ( or vaideba ) from a brāhmans woman, while according to Uśanas (18) he is the offspring of a pulkasa male from a vaisya girl. The Mahābhāṣya on Pān. (II. 4, 10 ) includes him under sūdra. Yāj. II. 48 mentions him as liable to pay his wife's debts, because his livelihood depends on her, The Sūdrakamalakara mentioned another caste of rajaka ( which is the offspring of an ugra male and vaidehaks female ).

Rathakāra. Vide above pp. 43, 45 for Vedic references. According to Baud. gr. II. 5. 6 and Bharadvāja gr. (I) his upanayana was to be performed in the rainy season. It appears he lost his status gradually. In the Baud. Dh.S.( I. 9. 6) he is the offspring of the marriage of a vaiśya male with a sūdra female. According to Yaj. I. 95 he is an anuloma doubly mixed as he is the offspring of a mahiṣya male from a karang female and according to a prose passage of Saṅkha quoted by the Mit. the rathakāra is entitled to have upanavana performed, to offer sacrifices and gifts and makes his living by learning the art of taming horses, of making chariots and building houses. According to Usanas (5-6) and Vaik.

(III. 7) makes the vaiṇa the offspring of an ambastba male from a vaidehaka female; and according to Manu X. 49 he makes his livelihood by beating musical instruments. Kullūka on Manu IV, 215 says that Vena is one who maintains himself by splitting bamboos and that he is the same as buruda according to Viśvarūpa.. For Vaiṇa see Āp. Dh. S. quoted under pulkasa (p. 89). Kaut. (IIL. 7) adds that a vainya follows the same profession as & rathakāra Śankba ( 17. 38), Viṣṇu Dh. S. 51. 14, Yāj.

But in other works like Baud. Dh. 8. (I. 9. 15), the word yrātya is applied to all who are born of the mixture of varṇas. 

Saka. Manu ( X. 43-44 ) mentions Sakas along with Yava nas and others as originally kṣatriyas reduced to the state of śūdras. Vide note on Yavana (p. 92) above. They are mentioned in the Mahābhārata along with Yayana and other non-Aryan tribes. Vido Sabhā 32. 16-17, 51. 23, Udyoga (4. 15; 19, 21; 160. 103 ), Blisma ( 20. 13 ), Droṇa ( 121. 13).

Svapaca or Svapāka. He is one of the antyajas enumerated by Veda-Vyasa ( I. 12-13). Vide note 173 above. He occurs in the gana kulālādi ( Pān. IV.3. 118). According to Baud. Dh. 8. (1. 9, 12), Kaut. (III. 7), he is the offspring of an ugra malo from a female of the ksatr sub-caste, while according to Manu 

X. 19 he is the offspring of a kṣatr male from an ugra female. Vaik. (X. 15 ) and Sūtasamhitā say that he is the offspring of a cāṇḍāla male and a brāhmaṇa female, while Uśanas (11) holds that he is the offspring of a cīṇdāla male from a vaisya woman. According to Manu X. 51-56 cāṇdālas and svapacas follow the same avocation and are governed by the same rules ( vide p. 81 under cāṇdāla). Usanas (12) says that they eat the flesh of dogs and that dogs are their wealth, while Vaik. says that they wear the same marks that cāṇḍālas have to wear (under the king's order, as Manu says in X 55 ), that they remove the filth of towns etc., stay near cemeteries, have to dis pose of corpses of men that leave no relatives, have to act as hangmen for offenders sentenced to death and to take their olothes eto., have to take food in broken pots and to eat dogs flesh and to deal in hides and armour (or in armour made of hides ). The Bhagavadgitā (5. 18 ) puts him on the same level with dogs. In the Mārkandeya-purāṇa (8. 81-83, 86, 96 ) a candāla is called svapāka ( i. e. no distinction is made between the two). In the Jātiviveka he is identified with the Mahar and with the Mang of the Deccan, 

Satvata. According to Manu X. 23 he is the same as kāruṣa above. 

Sudhanvācārya. According to Manu X. 23 he is the same as kāruṣa above. 

Suvarṇa. Acoording to Usanas (vv. 24-25) he is the offspring of the legal union with Vedic mantras of & brābmana male and a ksatriya female. It appears likely that the text is corrupt and we should read savarṇa for suvarṇa. He should perform rites prescribed by the Atharvaveda, he should by the king's order ride a horse, elephant or chariot, may act as the comman der of an army or may practise as a physioian.

Suvarṇakāra or Sauvarṇika or Hemakāra (goldsmith). A hiranyakāra is mentioned in the Vāj. 8. XXX. 17 and in Tai. Br. III. 4. 14. According to Viṣṇu Dh. S. X. 4 and Nārada (inādāna 274 ) a goldsmith or a dealer in bronze or a bania was to examine the balance in the balance ordeal. Manu IV. 215, Yaj. I. 163, Saṅkha and Sumantu quoted by Aparārka (pp. 1175, 1176 ) treat him on & level with karmakāra (blacksmith ) and niṣāda. Manu IX. 292 condemns him as the worst of all rogues (sarvakanṭakapāpistha ). For the view of Vaik. and Bphaspati vide under takṣan above (note 189). In the Maha bhārata it is said that after Paraśurāma's alleged extermination of the ksatriyas, some of them that escaped resorted to the castes of ironsmiths and goldsmiths.208 

Sacaka. According to Uśanas ( v. 43 ) he is an anuloma born of the marriage of a vaiśya male from a sūdra female.

(X. 15 ) and Usanas ( v. 22 ) he is a pratiloma, offspring of a vaidehaka from a ksatriya woman and engages in the work of sewing with a needle. Sauoika, according to the lexioon of Amara, is the same as tunnavāya (for which see above p. 83 ) and the Brahmapurāṇa quoted by Apar ārka (p. 1178 ) also equates sūcī with tunnavāya. 

Suta. For vedic references see above p. 43. According to Gaut. (IV. 15), Baud. Dh. S. (1. 9. 9), Vas. (18.6), Kaut. (III. 7), Manu (X. 11), Nārada ( stripussa 110), Viṣṇu Dh. S. (16.6), Yāj. (I. 93) and Sūtasamhita, he is a pratiloma sprung from a ksatriya male and a brāhmaṇa woman. Kauṭ is careful to add that the sūta who figures in the purāṇas as the reciter is quito different from this. A vārtika on Pāṇ. (VI. 3,70) teaches the formation of words like sūtaputri.208 According to Manu(X,47) and Viṣṇu the avocation of sūtas is driving a chariot ( i. e. breaking and yoking horses). According to Vaik. (X. 13) he makes his liveli hood by reminding the king of his duties and by cooking food for him, Usanas (v. 3) also says that his business is to remind (a king) of his duties.

are the attendants of brāhmaṇas and kṣatriyas and the latter need not carry out what the sūta says. According to the Vāyupurāṇa (vo). I. 1. 33-38 and vol. II. 1. 139 ) the gūta was to preserve the pedigrees of kings and great men and traditions about learning or books, he is not authorised to study the Veda, the middling way of maintenance for him is to depend upon kings and to look after chariots, elephants and horses; an inferior way of maintenance is the practice of medicine. The Vaik. (X. 13) and the Sūta. samhitā expressly say that the difference between the sūta and the rathakāra consists in this that the former is the offspring of a marriage, while the latter is the offspring of & clandestine union of a ksatriya male with a brāhmaṇa woman. The Sahyādrikhanda (26.53-54) says that he is inferior to ksatriyas, but is entitled to do all the work of a kṣatriya and that he also performs the work of a charioteer, of taming elephants and riding horses. 

Sūnika or Saunilca (a butcher). Acoording to Usanas (v. 14) he is the offspring of an āyogava from a kṣatriya woman. Hārita ( quoted by Aparārka p. 279) speaks of him in the same breath with rajaka and carmakāra. The Brahmapurāṇa ( quoted by Aparārka p. 1177 ) says that he is 'paśumāraka'. Sumantu207 quoted by Par. M, makes his food unfit for brāhmaṇas. He is the same as 'khātika' according to the Jātiviveka. 

Sairindhra. According to Manu X. 32 he is the offspring of a dasyu (as defined in Manu X. 45 ) from an ayogava woman and he makes his living by combing the hair (of men and women), he is not to be treated as a dāsa (i. e. he has not to eat ucobista food ), but is to perform menial work (such as sham pooing the body ) or is to subsist by catching deer etc. The word is included in the gaṇa kulālādi (Pān. IV, 3. 118 ). From the Mahābhārata we see what duties Draupadi disguised as sair andhri had to do for the queen of Virāṭa ( Virāṭa-parva 9. 18-19), viz.combing and arranging the hair, pounding unguents, making garlands. Similarly Damayanti became & sairandhri to the mother of the Cedi king (Vanaparva 65. 68-70), but she refused to eat ucohista food, would not wash the feet of any. body and would not allow any man to approach her. According to Adipurāṇa quoted in Sūdrakamalakara he lives by hunting deer and guarding royal harems and women after delivery.

Sopāka. According to Manu (X. 38) he is the offspring of a candāla male and a pukkasa female, subsists by the profession of being hangman to those whom the king condemns to death.

It will have been noticed that some of the castes mentioned in the smrtis such as ambaṣtha, māgadha, malla and vaidehaka are connected with countries (Amba, Magadha, Videha etc.), that some others are based upon race such as Abhira, Kirāta and Saka. Manu ( X. 43-45 ) and the Mahābhārata ( Anuśāsana parva 33. 21-23 and 35. 17-18 ) were prepared to admit that several foreign races like the Sakas, Yavanas, Kambojas, Dravi das, Daradas, Sabaras, Kirātas etc. were originally ksatriyas, but had been reduced to the status of sūdras by losing contact with brāhmaṇas or by not liking the idea of being subject to the brabmanical system. The Viṣṇupurāṇa (IV. 4. 47-48) says the game. Numerous names of castes arise from the professions they follow, o. g. ayaskāra, kumbhakāra, carmakāra, takṣan, tailika, nata, rathakāra, vena etc. Even in ancient times brāhmaṇas followed so many different occupations almost as in modern times that the list of brāhmaṇas who cannot be invited at śrāddhas because they follow occupations other than those prescribed for them is rather very formidable (vide Manu III. 151 ff. and the remarks on panktipāvana later on ). 

It appears that comparatively very early many among the brahmanas had given up the occupations peculiar to them and were entitled to be called brāhmaṇas simply because of their birth. The Mahābhāṣya 208 of Patañjali quotes a verse 'tapas, vedio study, and birth ( from brāhmana parents ) these are the causes why a person is called a brāhmaṇa; he who is devoid of tapas and vedio study is a brābmaṇa only by birth (and not a real brābmana)'. Similarly in another place Patañjali quotes a verse 'know this to be the auspicious sign of the best of brāhmaṇas, viz, whose lore, actions and birth are all three holy' (vol. II. p. 220 on Pāṇ. IV. 1. 44). Though in the Mahābhārata

Varna and character

it is often said that a brāhmaṇa is 80 by birth alone and that he deserves respeot from all, still we meet several times with passages 409 wherein there is a revolt against the caste system dependent on birth alone and where it is severely condemned and great emphasis is laid on the moral worth of a man. In the Vanaparva (181. 42-43) we are told t10 ' Truthfulness, restraint, tapas, generosity, non-injury to sentient beings, constant adherence to dharma-these always lead men to the fruition (of their goal) and not caste nor family'. Udyogaparva ( 43. 20 ff. ) explains at great length what is meant by self-restraint. In the Santiparvaan (189.4 and 8) 'Truthfulness, generosity, free. dom from hatred and wickedness, humility, kindness, and tapas he is known as a brāhmana where these are seen. If these signs are seen in a sūdra and they do not exist in a brāhmana, then the sūdra would not be a śūdra and the brāhmaṇa would not be a brāhmana'. In another place we are told 912 'there is no difference between the varṇas; the whole world is brāhma (the creation of Brahmā), since it was created by Brahmā in former ages and was evolved into varṇas by actions (or.occupations ).' Udyogaparva 413 ( 43. 49 ) remarks 'Do not regard a person as brāhmaṇa by his talk; he who does not depart from truth is a brahmana'; Vanaparva (216. 14-15) * that sudra who is always struggling for self-restraint, truthfulness and dharma is a brāhmaṇa in my opinion, for a brāhmaṇa is so by his character.' Vide Vanaparva (313. 108-111) and Yaj. I. 200 and Vrddha Gautama p. 632. It has been seen above (p. 6 ) that Gautama laid the greatest emphasis on the eight qualities of the soul. But

History of Dharmāsāstra 

[ Oh. II 

in spite of those sentiments the caste system dependent on birth has continued in all its strength and rigour for ages and writers like the Par. M. II. 1, p. 228 are emphatic in saying that between jāti and character one must look principally to the eminence of the caste. 

In certain medieval works called Jātiviveka and in other works like the Sūdra-kamalākara ( first half of 17th century A. D.) several moro castes are mentioned, some of which are set out below. 

Aghūsika or Andhasika-from a vaidehika male and a śūdra female; sells cooked food; also called Randhavanu. 

Avartaka--from a bbrjjakantha and a brāhmaṇa woman. 

Ahitundika--from a niṣāda and a vaideha female; called Gārudi in Marathi. 

Aurabhra-called Dhangar in Marathi (tends rams and ewes for their wool), 

Katadhūnaka--from āvartaka and a brāhmaṇa woman. Kuntalaka-the same as nāpita. 

Kuruvinda-from a kumbhakāra and a kukkuta female. Same as modern sāli, according to Sūdrakamalakara. 

Gholika from & Vyādba male and gārudi female. He is called Undiramāru (rat-killer) in the vernacular. 

Durbhara—from an āyogava and a dhigvaṇa woman; called Dohor ( or Dhor) in modern times. 

Paustika--from a brāhmaṇa and a niṣāda female; called in modern times Kahāra or Bhol ( palanquin-bearer). 

Plava-from a cāṇdāla and an andhra woman; called 'bādi' in modern times. 

Bandhula--from maitreya and jānghika female ; called Jbārekarl now ( who takes out gold particles from the dust at the doors of goldsmiths). 

Bhasmānkura~from a Śaiva fallen ascetio and a sūdra pro stitute; called Gurava by the Jātiviveka. 

Manyum--from a vaisya and a kṣatriya female; called Tāvadia ( thief oatcher). 

Romika~from malla and an avartaka woman; called Loṇār in modern times (manufacturer of salt).

Varna and modern castes 

103 

Salakya or Sakalya from a mālākāra and kāyastha woman; called Maniar. 

śuddha-Mārjaka-called Mandali ( who gains livelihood by singing and playing on musical instruments ). 

Sindolaka or spandālika, from a sūdra male and a māgadha female ; called Rangārl ( dyer ). 

In modern times each of the principal varṇas has numerous Bub-castes, based upon difference of country, occupation, sect and other causes. For example, brāhmaṇas are first divided into ten classes, five of them being Gaudas 14 and five Drāvidas. Among the Drāvida brāhmaṇas, the Mahārāstra brābmanas are again subdivided into numerous sub-castes such as the Cit pāvana (or Konkanastha), Karhāde, Deśastha, Devarukhe sto. It is said that in Gujerat there are 84 subcastes of brāhmaṇas, as most of which do not interdine nor intermarry. There is often a further distinction among the members of the same subcaste, viz, those who follow the priestly occupation and those who do not. The spirit of exclusiveness and ideas of superiority that arose in vedio times gradually led on to further and further divisons and subdivisions of people owing to geographical situation and other $10 causes. It appears that probably even in ancient times the brāhmaṇas of the north looked down upon the brāhmaṇas in eastern countries like Magadha. Vide notes 31-32 above and Fick (pp. 213-214). The Matsyapurāṇa ( 16. 16 ) says that brāhmaṇas who dwell in Mleccha countries, in Triśanku, Barbara, Odra (Orissa ), Andhra ( Telingana), Takka, Dravida and Konkana are not to be invited at śrāddhas.217

216. Sherring, vol. I. p. 99. gives the names of these 84 subcastes and Wilson in Indian castos' vol. II, pp. 92 ff. adds more bringing the total to 160. 

216. Vide Bombay Presidenoy Gazetteer, vol. 9 p. 18 (for Sarasvatas of Panjab having 470 subdivisions ). Wilson ('Indian castes' vol. II. p. 126 ) was informed that there were 469 guboastes of Sarasvata brobmanas and he enumerates those at pp. 127-133.

Among kṣatriyas there are several subdivisions, such as those claiming descent from the Sun or the Moon and those that call themselves to be Agnikulas ( vide Sherring, vol. I. p. 120 ff, and Tod's Rajasthan vol. I chapter VII for lists of royal tribes ). The Paramāras have 35 branches, Guhilots 24 branches. Chabmanas 26 branches, Solankis 16 branches and so on. 

Even among comparatively late works the total number of subcastes enumerated does not go beyond even two hundred. For example, Wilson in 'Indian castes vol. I pp. 65-70 mentions only 134 castes with their Sanskrit and modern Marathi names as gathered from the Jātiviveka, Mādhava-kalpalatā, Paragu. rāma-pratāpa and other works. It is only in the census reports prepared at great expense by the British Government after elaborate efforts and organization that the great complexity of the caste system in modern India is laid bare to the eye. But this work cannot, by reason of its limited scope, go into these varied and complex details of the hundreds of castes that exist in the several provinces of India,
