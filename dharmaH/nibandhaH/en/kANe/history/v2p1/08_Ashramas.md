In the preceding pages several questions connected with brahmacarya have been dealt with. Brahmacarya is, according to the theory of the dharmasutras and smśtis, the first of the four āśramas. Therefore, before proceeding to the next samskāra, viz. vivāha ( marriage ) which is the starting point of the second āśrama, it is necessary to discuss the origin and deve lopment of the idea of asramas. 

From the times of the most ancient dharmasutras the number of aśramas bas been four, though there are slight differences in the nomenclature and in their sequence. 988 Ap. Dh, 8. II. 9.21. 1 says 'there are four āśramas, viz. the stage of householder, ( staying in) the teacher's house, stage of being a muni, the stage of being a forest dweller.' That here mauna stands for the aśrama of sannyāsa is clear from Apastamba's own words in II. 9. 21.7 (atha parivrājah ) where he employs the word ' parivrāj' to indicate' mauna, Āp. places the house holder first among the āāramas, probably on account of the importance of that stage to all other Aśramas. Why he should mention the stage of forest hermit last is not clear, Gaut. also (III, 2 ) enumerates the four āśramas as brahmacāri, grhastha, bhikṣu and vaikhānasa. Here also Gaut, speaks of bhikṣu before vaikhānasa and Haradatta 988 explains this departure from the usual sequence of aśramas as due to the words in Gaut, 28. 47 where we read'prāg-uttamad traya āśramiñaḥ'(persons belonging to the three asramas except the last may constitute a pariṣad ), 1. o. to exclude vaikhānasa from the pariṣad he is mentioned last, Why the vānaprastha is called vaikhānasa will be discussed later on under the former word. Vas. Dh. 8. (VII. 1-%) names the four aśramas as brahmaoāri, grhastha, vānaprastha and parivrājaka.

Vas. Dh. S. (in XI. 34) employs the word yuti to denote 8 person in the fourth aśrama. Baud. Db.S.(I1.6.17) names the four āśra mas in the same way as Vasiṣtha and vouchsafes the interesting 

information that it was the asuru Kapila, son of Prablāda, who in his rivalry with the gods, made these distinctions to which & wise man should pay no heed. Wlist Baud.990 means appears to be that there is really one āśrama viz. that of the householder, that Kapila devised the scheme of four aśramas, so that those who become yānaprasthas and parivrājakas would perform no yajñas and thereby the gods would lose the offer. ings they received from men and become less powerful Manu VI. 87 speaks of the four asramas, the last being called yati by him and also 'samnyāsa' ( in VI. 96 ). It would thus be seen that a person who belongs to the last asrama is variously called parivrāt or parivrājuka ( one who does not stay in one place but wanders from place to place ), bhikṣu (one who begs for his livelihood ), nuni (one who ponders over the mysteries of life and death ), yati ( one who controls his senses ) These words suggest the various characteristics of the man who undertakes the fourth āśrama. 

The theory of Manu about these aśramas is as followe. The span of human life is one hundred years ( satāyur vai puruṣaḥ). All do not live to that age, but that is the maximum age one can expect to reach. This should be divided into four parts. As one cannot know beforehand what age one is going to reach, it is not to be supposed that these four parts are each of 25 years. They may be more or less. As stated in Manu IV, 1 the first part of man's life is brabmacarya in which he learns at his teacher's house and after he has finished his study, in the second part of his life he marries and becomes an house holder, discharges his debts to his ancestors by begetting Bons and to the gods by performing yajñas ( Manu V. 169 ). When he sees that his head has grey hair and that there are wrinkles on his body he resorts to the forest i. e. becomes a Vānaprastha (Manu VI. 1-2). After spending the third part of his life in the forest for some time he spends the rest of bia life as a samnyāsins (Manu VI. 33). Similar rules are found

The word āśrama does not occur in the Sambitās or Brāb. maṇas. But this cannot be stretched to mean that the stages of life denoted by this word in the sutras were unknown throughout the Vedic period. It has been shown above (p. 268) that the word brabmacarl occurs in the Rgveda and the Atharva veda and that brahmacarya is mentioned in the Tai. S., the Sat. Br. and other ancient Vedic works. So the stage of brabmacarya was well known in the remotest past. The fact that Agni is said to be *the gļhapati in our house (Rg. II. 1.2) 994 and the fact that in the famous verse (Rg. X. 85. 36 ) which is employed even to. day in the marriage ceremony the husband says to the bride when taking bold of her hand that the gods gave her to bim for gārbapatya (for attaining the position of a house-owner or housebolder) establish that the second stage of the householder was well-known to the Rgveda. There is nothing in the Vedic Literature expressly corresponding to the vānaprastha. It may however be stated that the Tāṇdya Mahabrāhniana 14. 4. 7 Aays that vaikhanasa sages were the favourites of Indra and that one Rahasya Devamalimluc killed them in a place called Munimaraṇa. Vaikbanasa means 'vānaprastha' in the sūtras and it is possible that this is the germ of the idea of vāda prastha. "Yati' used in the sutras and smrtis to indicate the fourth asramna of samnyaga does occur in the oldest Vedic texts. But there the meaning appears to be different. In the Rg. the word 'yati' occurs several times. But the sense is doubtful. Rg. VIII. 3. 9 runs · whereby ** when wealth was bes towed on Burgu and on yatis (or 'on Bhṛgu from yatis') you pro tected Praskaṇva'. Rg. VIII. 6. 18 reads 'O Indra, the yatis and those who were Bhrgus praised thee'; Rg. X. 72. 7 says 'O gods,

when you filled the worlds as the yatis ( did) you brought tbe sun bidden in the sea'. In the Tai."' S. VI.2.7.5 we read 'Indra threw yatis to the salāvṣkas (hyaenas or wolves), they devoured them to the south of the Uttaravedi.' The same words and story occur in the Kathaka sambitā VIII. 5, the Ait. Br. 35. 2 (prādat) and the Kauṣitaki Up. III. 1; in the last Indra said to Pratardana 

do know me only; I regard this as the most beneficial thing to man that he should know me. I killed the three-headed Tvāṣtra. I gave to the sālāvśkas the Arunmukha yatis.' In the Kathaka samhita (IV. 10) and the Tai. S. II. 4. 9. 2 it is stated that the heads of the yatis when they were being devoured fell aside and they (the heads) became the kharjūras (date palıns). Atharvaveda II. 5. 3. says 'Indra, who is quick in bis attack, who is Mitra and who killed Vṛtra as he did the yatis.' In the Tāndya Mahābrahmana VIII. 1. 4 Bṛhadgiri is said to be one of the three yatis who escaped from slaughter and who were then taken under his protection by Indra. All these passages taken together suggest that the yatis were people who had incurred the hostility of Indra, the patron of the Aryas, that they were slaughtered by the Aryas with the help of Indra and their bodies were thrown to the wolves and that they seem to have something to do with a country where the date.palm grew and that a few of them who escaped slaughter subse quently were won over and became the worshippers of Indra (and therefore in Rg. VIII. 6. 18 they are described as praising Indra ). So originally they were probably beyond the pale of the Vedic Aryans. If there is any connection betwoen yati and yatu ( sorcery ) which seems possible, the yatis were pro bably non-vodic sorcerers. 

In the Rg. X, 136. 2, there is a references to munis, who are wind-girt and who put on brownish dirt (dirty garments). In Rg. VIII. 17. 14 Indra is said to be the friend of munis (Indro muni. nām saklā) and in Rg. X. 136. 4 muni is said to be the friend of all gods. So it appears that even in the times of the Rgveda persons

who led a life of poverty, contemplation and mortification were known, and were honoured and called munis, while persons corresponding to them among non-vedic people were probably called yatis. But in both these words there is no idea of a certain stage in a well-knit scheme of life. Perhaps the earliest reference to the four āśramas, though somewhat obscure, occurs in the Ait. Br. 33. 11 'what (use is there ) of dirt, what use of antelope skin, what use of (growing) the beard, what is the use of tapas? O! brāhmaṇas I desire a son, he is a world that is to be highly praised.* *98 Here it is clear that ajina refers to brahmacarya, smaśrūṇi to vānaprasthas ( since accord ing to Manu VI, 6 and Gaut. III. 33 tbe vānaprestha had to grow his hair, beard and nails). Therefore 'malam' and 'tapas' must be taken respectively as indicating the householder and the sainnyāsin. A much olearer reference to three aśramas occurs in the Chandogya's Up. II. 23. 1 'there are three branches of dharma, the first (is constituted by ) sacrifice, study and charity (i. e. by the stage of householder), the second is (constituted by the performance of) tapas (i. e. the vānaprastha), the third is the brahmacārl staying in the house of his teacher and wearing himself out till death in the teacher's house ; all these attain to the worlds of the meritorious; but one who ( has correctly understood brahma) and abides in it attains immortality'. Tapas is a characteristic of both vānaprastha and parivrājaka. Therefore in this passage it is possible to hold that the three āśramas ( of student, householder and vāna prastha ) are mentioned. The last clause about 'brahmasamstha' differentiates the three asramas from him who has knowledge

of brahma and holds fast by it. That portion says that the consequence of the knowledge of brahma is immortality ; but it does not say expressly or impliedly that the stage of parivrājaka is a means of attaining the knowledge of brahma, So one may doubt whether samnyaga as an asrama is spoken of here, but there can be no doubt that the other three are clearly indioated here. Probably in the time of the Chāndogya there was no clear line of demarcation between the āśrainas of vānaprastha and earnyāsa and they rather coalesced into each other. Chān. Up. V, 10.1 and Br. Up. VI. 2. 15 support this conolusion 9000. In the Br. Up. III. 5. 1 there is a reference to brābmapas who on apprehending correct ly the Suprema Spirit turn away from the desires of progeny, wealth and of securing holy worlds and practise begging. Begging is a characteristic of samnyāsa in the sutras. Yājña valkya in the Bṛ. Up. IV.5. 2. tells his wife Maitreys that he was going into a life of prairajyā from being a householder. Mundaka Up. I. %. 11 refers to begging for him who has know ledge of brahma and Mundaka III. 2. 6 mentions 'gamnyāsa '. In the Jabalopaniṣad 1001 (4) it is said that Janaka asked Yājña. valkya to expound sainnyāsa and then the four asramas are distinotly set out ' after finishing the stage of student-hood, one should become a householder; after becoining a householder one should become a forest-dweller, after being a forest-dweller, one should renounce the world; or he may do otherwise viz. he may renounce the world after the stage of student-hood itself or after being an householder or from the forest. The very day on which he becoines desireless, he should renounce the world (become a saṁnyasin). Probably this passage 100% was not

before the author of the Vedantasūtra or ho did not regard tbe Jābālopaniṣad as very authoritative ; itherwise thero would hardly have been any need for the Vedāntabūtrakāra (in the Vedantasūtra III. 4. 18-20 ) to hold a discussion on Chandogya II. 23. 1. 

It is clear that in the tiines of the earliest Upanisade at least three ( if not four) asramas were known and that all four were known by their specific names to the Jābālopaniṣad. In the Svetaśyataropaniṣad (VI. 21 ) we have the word * atyāśramibhyah'. It is said there that the sage Svetasvatara, who acquired knowledge of Brahma, proclaimed the knowledge to those who had rison above the mere observances of asramas. 

No scholar Eastern or Western places Pānini later than 300 B. C. He knew Bhiksu-sūtras composed by Pārāśarya and Karnanda 1003 and he tells us that the word 'maskarin "1004 means parivrājaka. As sūtra works about 'bhikṣus' were composed before Pāṇini, this asrama of bhikṣus must have been an established institution centuries before Pāṇini. Buddhism took over tbis mode of life (pabbrijjū as tho Pali works gay ) from the brahmanical system. 

It has been already stated at p. 8 that the goals of existence were deemed to be four, viz dharma, artha, kama and mokṣa. The highest goal was mokṣa. All ancient Indian philosophy (whether Vedānta, Sāṁkhya or Nyaya) held that liberation from the never-ending cycle of births and deaths, and escape from the three kinds of duḥkha were the highest good. The gummum bonum consisted in non-return (anavșttih) to the world of pleasures and sorrows. The Chan. Up. 100VIII. 15. 1 winds up with the words and be does not return'. The Br. Up. VI. 2. 15, Prasna Up. I. 10 and others say the same. This supreme goal had fascinated all noble minds in whatever Bphere of life they might have been working. The greatest poot and dramatist of classical Sanskrit ends his most famous drama ( the Sākuntala ) with the prayer may self-existent God Śiva destroy for me rebirth 1006 This state of liberation or release is variously oalled mokṣa or mukti, amptatva, nihāreyasa,

kaivalya ( by the Saṅkhyas) or apavarga (Nyāyasūtra I. 1.2 ). For attaining this state man must know and realize that thero is only one Reality underlying all existence (and no plurality) and become disgusted with the passions and temptations of the world i. e. ho must bave nirveda and vairāgya ( as stated in the Bș, Up. III. 5.1 or Mundaka I. 2. 12). Merely reading from the books that desirelessness is necessary for release and immediately giving up the world would not serve the purpose. The man would be hankering, as the Bhagavadgitā says, after pleasures he has renounced. Therefore the anoient Indian writers devised according to their lights a schemo which is embodied in the theory and practice of the āśramas. In brahma carya the individual goes through the discipline of the will and the emotions, makes himself acquainted with the literary treasures of the past and learns obedience, respect, plain living and high thinking. Then he marries, becomes a householder, tastes the pleasures of the world, enjoys life, has gone, dis charges his duties to his children, to his friends, relatives and neighbours and becomes a useful, industrious and worthy oitizon, the founder of a family. It is supposed that by the time he is fifty years or so he has become convinced of the futility of human appetites and the pleasures of the world and is, therefore, called upon to resort to a forest life for pondering over the great problem of the life hereafter and to accustom himself to self-abnegation, austerities and a barınless life. This would lead on to the last stage, viz. samnyāse. He may succeed in this very life in realizing the supreme goal of mokṣa or he may have to continue to rise in spiritual height until after several births and deaths the goal is in view. The theory of varṇa dealt with man as a member of the Aryan society and laid down what his rights, functions, privileges, responsibilities and duties were as a meniber of that society. It was addressed to man in the mass. The theory of asramas addressed itself to the individual. It tells him what his spiri tual goal is, low he is to order his life and what preparations are required to attain that goal. The theory of agramas was truly a sublime conception and if owing to the exigencies of the times, the conflicts of interests and distractions of life, the scheme could not even in anoient times be carried out fully by every individual and seems to have failed in modern times, the fault does not lfe with the originators of this conception. Deussen was constrained to say (in E. R. E. under asrama ) how far the practice corresponded to this theory given in

Manu and other law books, we do not know; but we are free to confess that in our opinion the whole history of mankind has not much that equals the grandeur of this thought' and again in 'The Philosophy of the Upaniṣads' (tr. by Geden, 1906 ) p. 367 ' the entire history of mankind does not produce much that approaches in grandeur to this thought'. 

The three āśramas of householder, forest hermit and sam nyāga will be dealt with in detail bereafter. Only one question about āśramas in general remains to be discussed. With refe rence to the four aśramas, there are three different points of view (pakṣas) viz. samuccaya (orderly co-ordination), vikalpa (option) and būdha (annulment or contradiction). Those who hold the first view (samuccaya) say that a person can resort to the four asramas one after another in order and that he cannot drop any one or more and pass on to the next nor can he resort to the householder's life after becoming a saṁnyāsin ( vide Dakṣa I. 8-9, Vedāntasūtra III. 4. 40) e, 8. a man cannot take Baṁnyāsa immediately after brahmacarya. Manu (IV. 1, VI. 1. 33-37, 87-88) is the prime supporter of this view. The first part of the Jābālopaniṣad quoted above refers to this view. This view does not regard marriage and sexual life as impure or inferior to asceticism and on the contrary places it on a higher plane than asceticisin. On the whole the tendency of most of the dharmaśāstra works is to glorify the status of an house-holder and push into the background the two āśramas of vānaprastha and sainyāsa, so much so that certain works say that these are forbidden in the Kali age. The second view is that there is an option after brahmacarya i. e. a man may be come a paritrājaka inimediately after he finishes his study or immediately after the householder's way of life. This view is put forward by the Jābālopaniṣad as an alternative to the first view of samuccaya. This is the view also of Vasiṣtha VII. 3, Laghu Viṣṇu III. 1, and Yāj. III. 56. Āp. Dh. S. (II. 9. 21. 7-8 and II. 9. 22. 7-8) seems to favour this view. The third view of bādha is held by the ancient dharmasūtras of Gautama 1007 and Baudbāyana. They hold that there is really one asrama viz. that of the householder (brahmacarya being only prepara tory to it) and that the other āśramas are inferior to that of the householder. Vide Gautama (III. 1 and 35 ) where he first

Ob. VIII) 

Asramas 

425 

refers to the view about vikalpa (option) and emphatically says that there is only one asrama. Manu VI. 89-90, III. 77-80, Vas. Dh, S. VIII. 14-17, Daksa II. 57-60, Viṣṇu Dh. S. 59. 29 and many others praise the asrama of householder as the highest. Baud. Dh. S. (II. 6. 29 ff) says the same as Gautama and it relies 100% upon the fact that the asramas other than that of householder do not beget offspring and quotes Vedic passages viz, 'may we, O Agai, attain immortality through progeny (Rg. V, 4. 10=Tai. 8. I. 4. 46. 1) and 'a brāhmana when born is born involved in three debts, viz. he owes brahmacarya to the sages, sacrifice to the gods, and progeny to pitrs' (Tai. 8. VI. 3. 10. 5). According to Brahmasūtra III. 4. 18 Jaimini held this view, while Bādarāyana seems to have been of the opinion that all āśramas are enjoined (ibid. III, 4. 19-20). Those who hold this view (bādha ) rely on such Vedic passages 100% as one should offer agnihotra as long as life lasts' or 'indeed Agni. hotra is a satra (sacrificial session) that lasts till one dies by old age' ( Sat. Br. XII. 4. 1. 1), 'one should desire to live a hundred years performing religious acts' (Vāj. S. 40, 2), 'after bringing to the teacher wealth desired by him, do not cut off the thread of progeny' (Tai. Up. I. 11. 1). The Mit. on Yāj. IIT. 56 sets out these three views and says that each is support - ed by Vedic texts and one may follow any one of the three. Āp. Dh, S. ( 11. 9. 21, 2) held the view that whatever āśrama out of the four one followed, one attained happiness if one performed its duties according to the śāstra and after a lengthy discussion Ap. arrives at the conclusion that thero is no dis tinotion due to superiority among the four āśramas lol. There were some who thought that the houscholder's life was the rulo and the other āśramas were for the blind and other incapable persons. The Mit. on Yāj. III. 56 refutes this view. 

The word āśrama is derived 11 from 'śram' to exert, to labour and etymologioally means 'a stage in which one exerts oneseli,

Commentators like Sarvajña-Narayana on Manu VI. 35 endeavour to bring about reconciliation between the three views set out above as follows: the view that & man may pass on to sannyāsa immediately after the period of student-hood (without being a householder ) applies only to those men who are, owing to the impressions and effeots of restrained conduct in past lives, entirely free from desires and whose tongue, sexual appetites, belly and words are thoroughly under control ; the prescriptions of Manu enjoining on men not to resort to sarny āga without paying off the three debts are concerned with men whose appetites have not yet thoroughly been brought under control and the words of Gautama that there is only one aśrama (that of the house-holder) relate only to those whose appetites for worldly pleasures and pursuits are quite keen.
