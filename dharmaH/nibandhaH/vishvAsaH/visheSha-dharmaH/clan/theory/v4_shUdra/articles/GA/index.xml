      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the bhAgavata speaks of dvija husbands &amp;amp; their wives, it is speaking with reference to the shrauta/smArta dharma that these dvijas followed. The dvija man was expected to do various holy rites, based on shruti &amp;amp; smRti, to the gods &amp;amp; ancestors with his wife. Debasing her through those forbidden sexual acts (her consent is irrelevant; degrading sex even with wife is condemned) would render her unsuitable for sacred rites (which are the essence of dharma). Therefore, with a view to prevent such corrosive acts which perverts the sanctity of dAmpatya, such a hell is threatened for the dvija-s. The restriction to dvija-s is only because the bhAgavatapurANa is speaking with the shrauta-smArta dharma in mind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
