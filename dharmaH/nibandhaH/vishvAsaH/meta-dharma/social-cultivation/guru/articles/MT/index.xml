      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1590934692798558208.html&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;traditional-emphasis&#34;&gt;Traditional emphasis&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arya tradition places importance on the right coupling of teacher and student &amp;ndash; not every student is right for every teacher &amp;amp; vice versa. This is a custom-made pair. For exoteric matters, this might not matter that much &amp;ndash; as long as there is sufficient compatibilty &amp;amp; competence on both sides, one can learn procedures from the teacher.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, behind the procedures is a &amp;ldquo;meaning&amp;rdquo; that might be termed &amp;ldquo;esoteric&amp;rdquo;. For the transmission of this esoteric aspect of the teaching one needs that match to be nearly perfect &amp;amp; it has to proceed for most part in secret for as we have partly explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2022/01/16/subjective-and-objective-insight/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This knowledge can only be grasped when a special switch is turned on. Without that being the case, the teaching will seem like gibberish; hence, it would be inappropriate to put it out in public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The below was presented by {&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/blog_supplement/status/1082866709940367360&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;data&#34;&gt;Data&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We may infer from shaiva exegetical texts that the whole of the shaiva-shAstra was held as authoritative at a general level: starting from the old pAshupata material down to the latest srotAMsi and their evolutes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;We know that abhinavagupta and Bhatta rAmakaNTha-II were approximately coeval and abhinavagupta quotes rk quite positively providing evidence that the totality of the general validity shaiva-shAstra was held by a leading kaula teacher of the time. 3. Now we know that successors of the same Kashmirian schools of kaula and siddhAnta were there in Nepal and TN where the hand of mohammedanism was less effective and coexisted for a long time without displacing each other. In fact there is strong evidence for symbiosis even if the purists on either camp disagreed with that.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;E.g. we have tirumUlar of kashmirian origin synthesizing siddhAnta and kaula. The south indian successors of abhinavagupta were associated with saiddhAntika administered shrines like Chidambaram. In fact we have the south Indian kaula maheshvarAnandanAtha with clearly kashmirian links in terms of tradition being initiated by his female teacher in the vulgar mahArAShTrI prAkR^ita in a major saiddhAntika temple in the dravidian country.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the kaula and saiddhAntika traditions were strong across the country in pan-Indospheric networks. kaula teachers like kShemarAja who succeeded abhinava saw it as a rather valid practice to comment other shaiva traditions as valid scriptures like the netra-tantra or citing from the kriyAkAlaguNottara. This indicates the vitality of those other traditions down the line to jayaratha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
