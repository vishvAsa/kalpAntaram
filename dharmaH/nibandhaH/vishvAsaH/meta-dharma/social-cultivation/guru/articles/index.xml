      <description>&lt;p&gt;What does Gurukula mean:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Kula is already referring to a lineage. While all lineages have their own validity, not all lineages are the same.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is an academic institution where you learn real Shastras but this real learning is not separated from sādhanā.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Vimarsha as it stands now is both a movement and a school. My old approach to just a school did not work. Why? That means I have to rely on resourceful people and at the end, the agenda gets derailed and everything in the world is sucked up into the belly of the monster called politics.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideal-guru&#34;&gt;Ideal guru&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My ideal Guru for envisioning Vimarsha is Khaptad Baba. I have never witnessed so many siddhis in a single person other than Khaptad Baba, but he was trained as a medical doctor, a scientist by heart, and he always taught me to explore empirically. Even for something so impossible, like explaining his supernatural powers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
