Chauhan and Hon&amp;rsquo;ble Justice S.A. Bobde in  Hon&amp;rsquo;ble Supreme Court  of India. The judgment while established or rather re-established the fundamental religious and administrative rights of the ancient community of  Podhu Dikshitars of Chidambaram Sri Nataraja Temple -  also enunciated when, if at all, a Hindu Temple&amp;rsquo;s administration can be taken over and for how long.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

From interest-free compassionate creditors for poor farmers (loan to be paid through share of crop yield, which is repurposed for feeding of the devotees, travelers, orphans, etc) and sponsors of hospitals, pharmacies &amp;amp; schools (as Cōzha inscriptions show us), they have evolved to becoming dependent on crowds &amp;amp; relying on a massive retail of individual “arcana, abhiṣeka &amp;amp; darśana” tickets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are motivated by ignorance and desire to justify all State actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;They are wrong. Here is how.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Private run temples are much better run than govt. controlled temples. Goan temples are case in point. Anyone who has been to Goan temples knows this truth. Despite being different in appearance these places are very alive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(From : kAshyapa-kRShNa)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alwar swamin said KSV had talked about this. He said there is not much proof about any temple before 2000 years back. Even the sthala puranas of each older temple like ranganatha temple and even melkote as being there for yugas, are mainly to enhance faith in people and not historical. Even the ramayana and any other reference are weak references to state that temple culture was so ancient. The vaidika period and post-vaidika periods were more yajna and upasana based, as explained in vedas/upanishads.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our Agamas prescribe that temples should have a Vidyapeetham—a library meant to preserve and house important books/ texts. They also specify that Devi Saraswathi should be installed in such libraries. The Bhojsala Vagdevi temple at Dhar had one such library.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Tamil Nadu, the Vidyapeethams attached to temples were known as Saraswathi Bhandarams. These functioned as centers of learning, preserving vast collections of manuscripts and making them accessible for study.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://theprint.in/opinion/theprint-purana/when-did-large-hindu-temples-come-into-being-not-before-500-ad/1926655/&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When did large Hindu temples come into being? Not before 500 AD&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Dharmashastras opposed temple-based religious and ritual activities. Vishnu Smriti says that Vedic recitation shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be conducted &amp;lsquo;in a temple, in a cemetery, at a crossroads, or on a road.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Patrick Olivelle&lt;br&gt;&#xA;17 January, 2024&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to do a little thought experiment today. Imagine taking a trip to India a century or so before the Common Era using, thanks to AI, the recently discovered technology of time travel. You are transported to northern India. You hire a horse carriage and a travel guide. You cover the length and breadth of India. Something, however, was bugging you. You felt that something was missing from the landscape. So, you turned to your travel guide and asked: “Where have all the temples gone?” The guide was puzzled. He had no idea what you were talking about. “What is a temple?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The rush is so heavy that the adjacent Silom Road, a major thoroughfare, is closed to traffic for hours at peak times. This would all be quite typical for a Hindu temple in Delhi or Calcutta during any of our major festivals, but this is Thailand, and the Thai Buddhist devotees at this Navaratri festival outnumber Hindus ten to one. There are just 100,000 Hindus in Thailand, mostly relatively recent immigrants, with about eleven Hindu temples. But Hinduism, which first arrived here from South India over 2,000 years ago, permeates Thai religion and culture. Consider, for example, that the King has his own brahmin priest of Thai ancestry, or that the Thai script is based upon the South Indian Grantha script.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Sreedharan K S (@SreedharanKs)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this interview @RangarajPandeyR asked @jsaideepak why Justice Party wanted Govt Control of Temples, as they were the rich people administering temples. Here is some history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In early 19th century EIC had nominal control over temples, till it relinquished in 1863 by Act XX. The temples became one of the power centres. Where there was no Zamindar, Pandarasandhi, rich and powerful people got themselves associated with temples. The financial power of Temples were so great that invariably the politicians got involved. To get an idea of the Temple wealth, some of the big temples and adheenams had lot of property and money. Because of the lacunae in the Act XX, the temple and its properties were not managed well and it was very difficult to take a legal recourse. (Not all temples were under Jameens. Where there was no pre-existing setup, the management was arbitrarily given. The troubles arose because those who thought they had the rights, fought amongst themselves. There was misuse and murders in Adheenams in some cases.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Manisha Chitale takes us through the history and evolution of temple architecture in the country and how temples have shaped the Sanatana dharmik civilisation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;March 16, 2023&lt;br&gt;&#xA;By: Manisha Chitale&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh has an important landmark, printed on our currency notes. The Buddhist stupa of Sanchi stands atop a modest hill. This monument is dated to the third century BCE and is built by Mauryan king Ashoka and enhanced by Shunga rulers thereafter. The same hill has several other building structures. And one of them is the predecessor to the long tradition of temple building – a tradition that spanned across the subcontinent geographically as well as chronologically.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
