Kautilya’s 'Arthashastra', Manu’s laws—Ancient India had rich literature on jurisprudence


I was part of an editorial team that produced the _Cambridge Comparative History of Ancient Law_, which was [just published](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/cambridge-comparative-history-of-ancient-law/178F6A118ECB178E303D5D5F8DFDAFAB). As I was writing the chapter on ‘Legal Procedure’, it became obvious that ancient India produced some of the richest literature on this topic, vastly more copious and sophisticated than that of any other ancient civilisation. In the process, the Indian jurists created a well-developed [technical vocabulary](https://www.amazon.in/Sanskrit-Dictionary-Law-Statecraft/dp/9384082643).

## Legal procedure

The first detailed account of legal procedure, known in Sanskrit as _vyavahara,_ is found in Kautilya’s _Arthashastra._ However, it does not directly designate a person or institution in whom judicial power and functions of a society are vested. It simply describes the structure of civil and criminal courts and the procedures they are supposed to follow.

Civil courts are headed by a bench of three senior officers of the State. Kautilya says, “Justices (_dharmastha_) of ministerial rank (_amatya_) should conduct trials of lawsuits.” (Kautilya 3.1.1)

In the parallel criminal system, courts are overseen by a different set of officers called _pradestri._ _Manava-Dharmasastra_, or _The Laws of Manu_, written a century or so after Kautilya, on the other hand, explicitly vests judicial authority in the king himself. It is only in his absence that a substitute judge, called _pradvivaka_, presides over the court.

The king and chief judge, who are not necessarily legal experts, are assisted by three such experts called _sabhya_ or assessors. These three legal consultants are probably related to the three justices of the _Arthashastra_. Other court personnel include bailiff, accountant, and scribe.


## Plaint and plea

A lawsuit (_artha_) begins with a plaintiff (_arthi_) filing a plaint with the court. This initial plaint, called _bhasha,_ is written on an erasable surface such as a chalkboard. The plaintiff is permitted to revise it until the defendant (_pratyarthi_) files his plea (_uttara_), which is then written down along with the revised plaint on a more permanent surface such as a palm leaf.

Sources give clear guidelines as to the format of the plaint and plea. Any serious deviation from those guidelines would render them legally invalid. The fifth-century jurist [Yajnavalkya](https://theprint.in/opinion/maitreyi-from-upanishads-broke-wife-mother-mould-in-ancient-india/2151959/) calls the plaint and plea the first two of the four feet of a court proceeding.

Once the plaint and plea have been filed with the court, the substantive part of the court proceeding begins. According to Yajnavalkya, the third foot of the proceeding is the presentation of evidence. The task before that, however, is to determine which party has the burden of proof. This may seem obvious today: The plaintiff has the burden of proof. However, the ancient Indian jurists saw the issue as more complex.

The kind of plea entered by the defendant determines which party must produce evidence. If it is one of admission (_sampratipatti_), then the legal proceedings stop and the plaintiff wins the case. If it is one of denial (_mithya_), then the burden falls on the plaintiff.+++(5)+++

The ancient law recognises two other scenarios: The defendant can present a qualified admission, also called a special plea. For example, if the plaint says the defendant took a loan of Rs 1,000, the defendant may admit that he did indeed take the loan but claim that he paid it back. Alternatively, the defendant can claim that the same plaintiff filed an identical lawsuit previously and a court found him innocent.

In both these cases, the burden of proof shifts from the plaintiff to the defendant. He has to prove that he did indeed pay back the loan or that a prior court ruled in his favour.


## Types of evidence

Once the burden of proof has been determined, the presentation of evidence begins. The most significant kind of evidence is live witnesses. (This was especially so prior to about the fourth century CE when writing became widespread and legal documents began to play an important role.) Unless both parties agree, a minimum of three witnesses is required.

There are detailed rules regarding the admissibility of witnesses for both the plaintiff and the defendant. These rules relate to a variety of factors, including social class, gender, and age. 

### Witnesses
Witnesses are admonished by the judge to say truthfully what they have seen or heard, reminding them of the dire consequences, both here and in the hereafter, of bearing false witness:

> “Whatever good deed you have done over hundreds of lifetimes, all that will go to the man you defeat by your false testimony.” (_Yajnavalkya Dharmashastra_ 2,79)

A false witness, as also anyone who suborned perjury, is sent into exile. The sources identify clues to detect false testimony. These include sweating, the face changing colour, lips becoming parched, looking from side to side, and the like. It is, however, for the judge and assessors to determine who is speaking the truth, even though the statements of most witnesses are accepted as probative.

### Lekhya
Post-Gupta sources place greater weight on documentary evidence (_lekhya_). Here, the judges are told to be attentive and detect forged documents. The sources assume that most legal transactions—especially loans—are accompanied by a legal document attested by witnesses and they spell out the format and legal requirements of a valid document.

### bhukti
The third kind of evidence is possession (_bhukti_). This is especially pertinent for litigation with respect to land and houses. It is a principle of jurisprudence that possession over a certain number of years, usually 10, without objection establishes a person’s ownership over real property.

### Ordeals
The final form of evidence, which may seem quaint to us, is ordeals. Sources give detailed rules for ordeals with fire, water, balance, and so on. In medieval times, entire books were written on this topic. The assumption is that gods, who are wedded to truth, will identify a person who tells a lie in court.

## Judicial deliberation

The final phase of the proceeding—the fourth foot—is judicial deliberation (_pratyakalita_) followed by the verdict (_nirnaya_). The court usually issues a document (_jayapatra_) recording the judgment and gives it to the party that wins the case.+++(5)+++ The loser is forced to indemnify the victor and in addition, is assessed a fine.

The losing party, however, can file an appeal to a higher court. Sources generally recognise five fora or courts for resolving disputes: family (_kula_), guild (_shreni_), company (_gana_), the royal court, and the king himself. The legal procedure outlined above is that of royal courts.+++(5)+++ Individuals who lose cases at the family or guild level can always appeal to a royal court. The losing side in the royal court also can appeal to the king himself, whose judgment is final and not subject to appeal.

In this brief essay, I have given parenthetically the Sanskrit legal terms to highlight the sophisticated technical vocabulary of ancient Indian jurisprudence. Its earliest appearance can be found in documents from the centuries just before the Common Era. Around the sixth or seventh century, we get texts exclusively devoted to legal procedure, such as those ascribed to Narada, Katyayana, and Brihaspati. By the Gupta times (320-550 CE), this vocabulary can be seen to have undergone remarkable growth.

Jurisprudence stands out as one of the major achievements of ancient Indian intellectual tradition.
