## Hyper-Conservative beliefs
Conservatives (eg. sundararAma vAjapEyin) quote some pramANa which says  
"using water in contact with iron makes you a chaNDAla or something". (LOL)  

### Gas cylinders
(mAdhva conservative) Logic for gas inferiority:

LPG Gas cylinder enters other homes -  
so even if it's connected from outside,  
it "pollutes" the pipe,  
which "pollutes" to the stove.  

So, some come up with ideas like -  

- Let us bore a channel within rock.
- Let us use coal instead. We'll build a "cook multiple dishes at once" contraption to imitate pressure cookers.
