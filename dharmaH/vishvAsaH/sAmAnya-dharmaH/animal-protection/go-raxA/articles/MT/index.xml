      <description>&lt;p&gt;मानसतरङ्गिणीकृद्-अभिप्रायः (Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threader.app/thread/1345790425576173568&#34;&gt;TR&lt;/a&gt; ).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-state&#34;&gt;Early state&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The domesticated Bos was a central animal for the subsistence of the Indo-European pastoralists on the steppe. It was also a major domesticate for thethe pre-IE Indian peoples like the Harappans and the neolithic Ash Mound culture of southern India (i.e. the bUti-palli/halli-s; early Dravidians?). What is clear is that these pre-IE &amp;amp; circum-IE entry peoples of India consumed the flesh of cattle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, it is like the female animal (henceforth cow) was also valued for milk-&amp;gt;curds/cheese(?) among both the Harappan and Ash Mound peoples. The former probably also used them as draught animals. The situation was similar with the IEans on the steppe with their version of Bos cattle playing a major role in food (both diary and flesh) and as draught animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://threader.app/thread/1436749290412576768&#34;&gt;https://threader.app/thread/1436749290412576768&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;do you think foreign breed cows are also vandanIya to a Hindu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a question of phylogenetic radius akin to that faced in defining biological categories likes species or genus. If the center is an Indian cow then how far does the radius go? Are serially bison, yak, gaur and buffalo fine? What are the rules to resolve it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMO we first go with biology. The buffalo (not what Americans think a buffalo is) &amp;amp; the rest of the bovid TMK don&amp;rsquo;t hybridize. Hence, the buffalo can be placed outside this radius.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
