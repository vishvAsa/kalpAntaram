बृहदारण्यक उपनिषद in the 4th brAhmaNa of 6th chapter provides some tricks for the couples to conceive the type of progeny they desire. The order in which those desired progenies is listed is interesting:

1) A fair boy who goes on to study (one) Veda
2) A tawny/brownish boy who goes on to study 2 Vedas
3) A dark boy w/ reddish eyes who goes on to study 3 Vedas
4) A scholarly daughter (no mention of Veda, no reference to her looks)
5) A boy who goes on to be a scholar frequenting assemblies, speaking delightfully, a student of all the Vedas and musically inclined (no reference to looks)

## Commentaries

Three commentaries on this are worth noting:
1. Raghūttama Yati (16th cent.) explains 'paṇḍitā' as 'she who possesses knowledge of āgama in accordance with her ability'.
2. Rāghavendra Tīrtha (16th cent.) explains 'paṇḍitā' as 'abhijñā', & doesn't state its limits.
3. Raṅgarāmānuja (17th cent.) says the 'pāṇḍitya' of the daughter is about laukika/non-vedic things. He too does not state any limit.
