Janaka Vaideha wanted to know who was the best among the 'anūcānas' (learned in Vedas).  
In the assembly of such 'anūcānas' we find Gārgī.  
Was she there because she was 'anūcāna' or for another reason?  
In one Gṛhya text, she is named alongside Ācāryas.
If she was indeed learned in Vedas, how did her study happen?  
If she wasn't, in what capacity was she in such an assembly?

Vaḍavā Prātitheyī, Sulabhā and Maitreyī are also mentioned along with her in the same Gṛhya text.
