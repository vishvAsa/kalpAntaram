      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://swarajyamag.com/culture/am-i-a-hindu&#34;&gt;TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve observed anti-hindus (esp. christians) attack &amp;ldquo;sati&amp;rdquo; (properly - anugamana), and hindus going on the defensive. A response I prefer is to proudly accept that practice as a noble choice in certain rare circumstances and point to famous non-hindu dramatizations. In this thread, let us collect such (Please add further high-quality ones).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;europe&#34;&gt;Europe&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Noble Brünnhilde after Siegfried in Wagner&amp;rsquo;s Götterdämmerung &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhdVNvd7yKo&#34;&gt;YT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;diódōros&#34;&gt;Diódōros&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Diódōros&amp;rsquo;s account - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0541%3Abook%3D19%3Achapter%3D34&#34;&gt;Perseus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Note that Diódōros described the Greeks as condemning the practice (calling it ἄγριος &amp;ldquo;wild&amp;rdquo; and χαλεπός &amp;ldquo;savage&amp;rdquo;), but the fact that Greek soldiers in the vicinity of India adopted this practice demonstrates that many non-Indians did indeed see something beautiful and noble in the practice, and it was not a practice forced upon people.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most striking account, from the years after the death of Alexander, is the case of the wife of the general Ceteus. 53 Ceteus died in the first major battle between the two successor generals, Antigonus and Eumenes, in late 317 BCE, which took place somewhere in the desert of central Iran. He was in charge of the Indian troops, and had two Indian wives, both of whom vied for the honour of being burned alive with his corpse. The younger asserted that the elder was pregnant and therefore could not be burned, while the elder demanded that as the senior wife she should have the right to carry out the sacrifice. Midwives were fetched to determine that the elder was indeed pregnant, on which she departed weeping, rending the wreath that was about her head and tearing her hair? The younger wife rejoiced, and advanced on the pyre dressed as if for a wedding, with ribbons in her hair; she gave away her jewellery – rings set with precious stones, necklaces and a circlet for her head, of golden stars studded with jewels - mounted the pyre, assisted by her brother, and, after the army had marched three times around the pyre, submitted calmly to the flames.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
