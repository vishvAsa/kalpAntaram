      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Suicide of an Officer&amp;rsquo;s Wife.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Tokyo papers report the suicide of the wife of Lieut. Asada, who was killed in the last Manchurian campaign undertaken by Gen. I &amp;ndash; in order to recover Feughwau.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Asada was a daughter of Major Okami, who commanded the third battalion of the Maruyama force. She was brought up under a rigid system and had only married the lieutenant the year before last. She was very virtuous, and was regarded by all who knew her as the model of a soldier&amp;rsquo;s wife. The lieutenant held his commission in the battalion commanded by his father-in-law, and it was from her father that the young widow received the tidings of her husband&amp;rsquo;s death. After writing an account of the battle, the letter went on to this effect:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some interesting points about sati:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems to be a kSatriya practice of NW provenance as far as bhArata is concerned. However, the practice definitely had external roots.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Initial reaction by brAhmaNas, prominently medhAtithi, was stern opposition as the shruti condemns those who end their life before the expiry of its natural term. Even if brAhmaNas couldn’t prevent sahagamana’s popularity among kSatriyas, they disliked it for their own women. Subsequent rise in prominence &amp;amp; support for sahagamana rests on secondary citations of smRtis as exceptions to the shruti’s general rule against suicide; most of which are not traceable to the cited sources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My aunt was dressed in a red silk &lt;em&gt;sari&lt;/em&gt;, with all the ornaments on her person; her forehead daubed with a very thick coat of &lt;em&gt;sindur&lt;/em&gt;, or vermilion; her feet painted red with &lt;em&gt;alta&lt;/em&gt;; she was chewing a mouthful of betel; and a bright lamp was burning before her. She was evidently wrapped in an ecstasy of devotion, earnest in all she did, quite calm and composed as if nothing important was to happen. In short, she was then at her &lt;em&gt;matins&lt;/em&gt;, anxiously awaiting the hour when this mortal coil should be put off. My uncle was lying a corpse in the adjoining room. It appeared to me that all the women assembled were admiring the virtue and fortitude of my aunt. Some were licking the betel out of her mouth, some touching her forehead in order to have a little of the sindur, or vermillion ; while not a few, falling before her feet, expressed a fond hope that they might possess a small particle of her virtue. Amidst all these surroundings, what surprised me most was my aunt&amp;rsquo;s stretching out one of her hands, at the bidding of an old Brāhman woman, and holding a finger right over the wick of the burning lamp for a few seconds until it was scorched, and forcibly withdrawn by the old lady who bade her do so in order to test the firmness of her mind. The perfect composure with which she underwent this fiery ordeal fully convinced all that she was a real Sati, fit to abide with her husband in Boykunta, paradise. Nobody could notice any change in her countenance or resolution after she had gone through this painful trial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
