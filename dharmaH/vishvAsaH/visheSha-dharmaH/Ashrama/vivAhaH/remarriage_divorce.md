title = "Remarriage, Divorce"

+++

## Theory
"Divorce" is not a shAstrIya karma - ghaTa-shrAddha would be. Some people do it in case of divorce. (the concern addressed here is the possible fault due to non-performance of Ashaucha for divorced spouse's death etc..)

### बहुपत्नीत्वम्
बहुपत्नीत्वम् अङ्गीकृतम्। "मृता जाया पुनर् जाया" इति लोकोक्तिः प्रसिद्धा।  

किञ्च - आपस्तम्बधर्मसूत्रय् एवं वर्तते - "धर्मप्रजासंपन्ने दारे नान्यां कुर्वीत १२"।

Being in the dharma-sUtra this adhikAri-bheda would (arguably) be a "hard rule" for Apastambins. 
But, for others - maybe some other smRti explicitly allows even in other cases, leading to a case of "tulya-vikalpa"?

> In case she be still a virgin, or having gone away comes back, she is fit to undergo re-marriage with her second husband.

> नष्टे मृते प्रव्रजिते क्लीबे च पतिते पतौ। पञ्चापत्सुचनारीणां पतिरन्यो विधीयते ॥ 
  
> When the husband is absconding, dead, has renounced family life, has fallen (morally), or is eunuch, in these five unfortunate circumstances it is prescribed that a woman can choose another husband. (Parasara Smriti 4.30, Also occurs in Narada Smriti 12.97)

> उद्वाहितापि या कन्या न चेत्सम्प्राप्तमैथुना। पुनःसंस्कारमर्हेत यथा कन्या तथैव सा॥ Narada Smriti 12.22

> In case she be a virgin though married, re-marriage is allowed. She is as good as a virgin. (Translation is mine and is not literal. I could not find a good translation of Narada Smriti).

> अद्भिर्वाचा च दत्तायां म्रियेताथो वरो यदि। न च मन्त्रोपनीता स्यात् कुमारी पितुरेव सा॥ यावच्चोदाहृता कन्या मन्त्रैर्यदि न संस्कृता। अन्यस्मै विधिवद्देया यथा कन्या तथैव सा ॥ Vasishtha Smriti 15.64-65

> If the betrothed of a maiden dies after she has been given away to him by words and water but before she was married with Mantras, she belongs to her father alone. If a maiden has been carried away by force and not married with Mantras, she may be lawfully given away to another man. She is like a maiden.

## Practice
- Gazetteer of the Ambala District: 1883

> "As regards remarriages of widows the only classes that remarry are Jats Lohárs Jhínwars Tarkháns Mehtams who are allowed by their custom to go through the ceremony of Karewa Among Musalmans with the exception of Saiyads Moghals Pathans Shekhs and Rájpúts all women remarry. Among a the inferior castes who are in short Shúdras when one brother dies the widow is not allowed to go out of the family but is claimed by one of the other of the brothers who look upon her as belonging to the family money having been spent upon her and litigation in the courts both on Civil and Criminal sides to enforce these supposed rights froquently takes place I mention the Criminal as well as Civil Courts since it is not an uncommon matter for a brother to prosecute his sister in law and any second husband she may take for Bigamy because she has failed to transfer her affections to the surviving brother..."
