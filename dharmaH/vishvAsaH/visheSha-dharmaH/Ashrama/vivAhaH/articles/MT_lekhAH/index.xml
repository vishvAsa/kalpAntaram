      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2006/01/12/delusions/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is fashionable these days for some parents to describe their&#xA;daughters by the following terms:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Modern 2) Forward 3) City-type 4) Progressive 5) Modern but Indian.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Modern but Spiritual. The simple message is that one must be beware&#xA;of such women- they are verily living graveyards for the deluded.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Hindu youth have been deluded in many ways by the waves of mlecchaic&#xA;subversion lashing the Indian shores. These are affecting both the sexes&#xA;in drastic ways but in the case of daughters often Hindu parents live a&#xA;disconnected world of their own making, much as chAchA Nehru imagined&#xA;that he was the center of the world. These deluded Hindu youth are&#xA;characterized by the following fancies: 1) In movies they watch entire&#xA;lives compressed into 1-3 hr capsules. Every emotion is intense and&#xA;instant. Sex happens right away, sexual romance is instant, heroes and&#xA;heroines achieve their goals in that brief span of the movie. As a&#xA;result the youthful watcher believes in instant gratification.&#xA;Everything he or she wants should come immediately or else they will&#xA;throw tantrums. 2) They are much richer than the older generation, so&#xA;they lose track of the value of money and are willing to spend it on&#xA;vices. 3)Macho Moslem men and handsome men and women are projected as&#xA;their ideals. So they strive to emulate these, in the process losing&#xA;their own sense of identity and also get secularized. 4) Their peer&#xA;pressure guilds prevent them from doing anything profound and drive them&#xA;to wallow in shallow thoughts, cheap entertainment and low-grade humor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The text is attributed to a certain puShkara and contains 19 verses. The tract may be dated to approximately to the period of the first 6 centuries of the common era. I examined it because it throws interesting light on old Indian customs. Below are some excerpts:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
