      <description>&lt;p&gt;Śiva Caturmukha&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The myth of Tilottamā&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In chapter 203 of the ādiparvan of the Mahābhārata we are told that, in order&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;to kill the Asuras Sunda and Upasunda, who could only be killed by each other, Viśvakarman, ordered by Brahmā, creates a woman of unparallelled&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;beauty. The Grandfather tells her to go to the two demons and to seduce them in order that they may kill one and other in their rivalry over her̥ This beauty, named Tilottamā, promises to do so and takes her leave of the gods by making a circumambulatioṇ Among those gods is Bhagavat Maheśvara, who sits to the south (scil. of Brahmā) with his face turned east, whereas the gods sit to&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagination, Imagery, and Image in Vedic and Śaiva Initiation Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 25: 34 (cf. Ecclesiastes 10: 2)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Introduction&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transformation of the Vedic religion into new systems of belief and practice, early Hinduism for short, is a process of cultural change that, despite two centuries of research, has only partly been understood. The replacement of the sacrificial fire by images of wood and stone is among the most obvious innovations. As has been convincingly argued by Phyllis Granoff (2006), this innovation was only reluctantly accepted in some circles of brahmanic orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Descent of God in Gujarat and the Practice of Imitating God Kauṇḍinya’s Pañcārthabhāṣya&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kuśika and the divine revelation&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we speak of the gospel of Kauṇḍinya, we call forth an association with texts which describe the birth, life, and deeds of a saviour, texts which are meant to bring good news, an evangelium, into the world. This evocation is deliberate. As a tribute to Jan Bremmer’s life-long engagement, scholarly and otherwise, with gospels and kindred texts that have just failed to reach that status, I would like to show, that a text called ‘The Five Topics’, Pañcārtha,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About Heracles, Lakulīśa and Symbols of Masculinity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lāguḍi&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The study of the origins of organized Saivism received a completely new perspective with the publication of the Pāśupatasūtras (PS) and Kauṇḍinya’s com-&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;mentary thereon, the Pañcārthabhāṣya, by r̥ Ananthakrishna Sastri in 1940.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Research by Minoru Hara, Daniel Ingalls, Alexis Sanderson, Thomas Oberlies, Peter Bisschop, and Diwakar Acharya, to mention just the major players in this field, built on this new evidence and has paved the way for our present investigation, which draws heavily on their work. 1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An Artist’s Impression&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Friends, if you will permit me, let me be that kavi  today. 1 Allow me to take advantage of this unique occasion to read an essay in the indicative mood. No modal auxiliaries: neither ‘would’ nor ‘should’; neither ‘may’ nor ‘could’. In other words, a thoroughly unscholarly exposition, but a, hopefully light, and delightfully careless artist’s impression, which puts ‘how beautiful it may have been, possibly’ into an apodictic style: ‘so beautiful it was, definitely’. After all, an artist’s impression is, according to the infallible Wikipedia, ‘the representation of a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
