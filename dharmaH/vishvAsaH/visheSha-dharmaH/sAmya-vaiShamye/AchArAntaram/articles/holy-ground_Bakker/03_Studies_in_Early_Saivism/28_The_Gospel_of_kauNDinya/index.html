  <p>The Descent of God in Gujarat and the Practice of Imitating God Kauṇḍinya’s Pañcārthabhāṣya</p>
<p>Kuśika and the divine revelation</p>
<p>When we speak of the gospel of Kauṇḍinya, we call forth an association with texts which describe the birth, life, and deeds of a saviour, texts which are meant to bring good news, an evangelium, into the world. This evocation is deliberate. As a tribute to Jan Bremmer’s life-long engagement, scholarly and otherwise, with gospels and kindred texts that have just failed to reach that status, I would like to show, that a text called ‘The Five Topics’, Pañcārtha,</p>
<p>which has the form of a commentary ( bhāṣya) on the Sūtras of the Pāśupata</p>
<p>school (the Pāśupatasūtras (PS)), resembles a gospel in many respects. Not</p>
<p>only by the dramatic facts which it professes to report, but also by its apodictic style, and its pretence to communicate a divine revelation, presenting a unique path ( sādhana), which alone is able to promise and deliver hope and salvation to the faithful. Its author, Kauṇḍinya, who may have lived in the 4th century ad, puts himself in the lineage of preceptors that descends directly from the divine teacher’s first disciple, Kuśika. 1</p>
<p>It is generally accepted that this Kuśika has been a historic person, who may have lived in the 2nd century ad. He is mentioned by name as the fountainhead of a lineage of ten teachers in the Mathurā Pilaster Inscription of Candragupta</p>
<p>II, Year 61 (i.e. ad 380/81, or ad 388, according to Falk 2004, 173).2 Kauṇḍinya describes how and why this Kuśika came to be elected to receive and spread the divine word. He begins by defining the nature of God.</p>
<p>And accordingly, since His nature is play ( krīḍā) . . . (it is certain that) the activity</p>
<p>of God is springing from play. And (His) activity, insomuch as this consists in proclaiming the doctrine, is for the sake of bestowing favour ( anugraha). (Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1)</p>
<p>∗ The first version of this article was published in Dijkstra, Jitse, Justin Kroesen, &amp; Yme Kuiper (edṣ), Myths, Martyrs, and Modernity.

<p>The emphasis Kauṇḍinya lays upon the true nature of God as play is to safeguard His sovereignty, His omnipotence ( prabhutva). This nature of God, here defined for the first time, will remain an integral feature of nearly all Hindu conceptions of god, and we will meet it again below in this essay. Bestowing favour is God’s free choice, not induced by anything outside Him. His absolute freedom is without beginning and end, but, in order to fulfil His wish, He takes birth.</p>
<p>So, on account of His ability to do whatever He wishes, and His being unborn, God, having taken upon Him a body of a brahmin, has descended in Kāyāvataraṇa in</p>
<p>human form. And He has reached Ujjayanī by fooṭ How do we know that? (We know that) on account of the authoritativeness of learned persons ( śiṣṭa), and</p>
<p>because we (still) see and hear the proofs thereof. (Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1; above, ṇ 7 on p. 529)</p>
<p>This event is of a completely different nature as the mythic avatāra  stories that</p>
<p>we know from the Vaiṣṇava religioṇ Its measure is human and it has a ring of historicity. Imagine Viṣṇu’s descent as the Boar or the Tortoise, going on foot from one historical site to another, a distance of 290 km as the divine aerial chariot ( vimāna) flies!</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya continues by telling that this divine brahmin smeared himselves with ashes and selected a sanctuary in Ujjain as his place of residence. Unfortunately the name of the sanctuary is not mentioned and the later tradition of the Skandapurāṇa locates this residence in the cremation ground ( śmaśāna) of</p>
<p>Ujjaiṇ</p>
<p>Thereupon Lord Kuśika arrived, impelled by God; he saw the signs of perfection, such as complete contentment, in the preceptor and the opposites thereof in himself; falling at his feet he informed him properly about his caste, gotra, Vedic affiliation, and his being free of debts; then, at an appropiate moment, (this) pupil, who was like a patient, consulted the preceptor, who had bided his time, and who was the doctor as it were: ‘Lord, is there a remedy that is effective and final for all those pains which fate, the world and we ourself afflict upon us, or not?’</p>
<p>(Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1)</p>
<p>On this pertinent question, the holy brahmin, the incarnation of God, said: atha, ‘well’. Kauṇḍinya explains:</p>
<p>Here the word ‘well’ relates to what earlier had happened. In what way [a student may ask] ? He has said ‘well’ in relation to the earlier question put by the pupil.</p>
<p>Thus this word atha (‘well’) signifies the answer to what has been asked: that end to suffering ( duḥ khānta) does exisṭ (Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1)</p>
<p>‘Well’ is the opening word of the gospel, being the first word of the first Sūtra.</p>
<p>It is followed by the word ataḥ , for which see above, p. 513. Then follows the word paśupateḥ , ‘of Paśupati’, i.e. ‘of God’. This expression Kauṇḍinya takes as the answer to a further question: ‘due to what is this “being without suffering”</p>
<p>reached?’ It is reached, Kauṇḍinya preaches, due to the grace ( prasāda) of God, which initiates union ( yoga) with Him.</p>

<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>543</p>
<p>That (union), (according to some), comes about by the act of one only—as in the case of a post and the falcon—because it is (said to be) effected by meditation, study etc. of a human being ( puruṣa). [However, we believe that] it comes about by the act of both—as in the case of (two fighting) rams. (Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.1) This mystical union, therefore, lies not entirely in the hands of the aspiranṭ</p>
<p>The difference, Kauṇḍinya observes, between his and other salvation doctrines is precisely this: only Śiva’s grace saves. In order that man may receive it, God has descended in an act of mercy and taught the doctrine as worded in the Pāśupatasūtras. In biblical terms: ‘And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth’ (John 1:14). These Sūtras are therefore</p>
<p>seen as divine revelation and Kauṇḍinya’s task it is to proclaim and explain them, that is, like Kuśika before him, to bring the good news.</p>
<p>When its</p>
<p>contents is fully understood and put into praxis ( viddhi), the believer becomes qualified ( adhikārakr̥tatva) to receive that grace, which is concomittant with the removal of his separation ( viyoga) from God. United with God he shares in His omniscience and omnipotence, and all his suffering comes to an end. He experiences, in Byzantine terms, theˆ</p>
<p>osis (</p>
<p>).</p>
<p>The power of the word</p>
<p>Intrinsically connected with the soteriological claim of the Pāśupata faith is the</p>
<p>tradition that the holy word is passed down a lineage of accomplished teachers, who all, at the moment that they divulge the truth in the appropriate ritual setting, impersonate the divine incarnation, a doctrine not altogether different from Jesus’ message to his apostles: ‘For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you’ (Matthew 10:20).</p>
<p>However, in my view the Indian type of religion, to which the Pāśupata</p>
<p>faith belongs, pushes this idea further than Catholicism, notwithstanding the Fourth Lateran Council and that of Trent on the Eucharist, and this has to do with its concept of primordial sound ( śabda). Despite some similarity, but</p>
<p>essentially unlike the evangelist John’s logos, the revealed word, or rather its sound, is conceived of as an embodiment of divine power that has, we could say, the magic potency to actualize or reify the divine and to deify those by whose mouths it is pronounced. This feature of the Indian religions, the idea of śabdabrahman, is the legacy of the Vedic brahmins. It has given rise to much hocus-pocus, on the one hand, and to sublime monuments of spirituality on the other̥ 3</p>
<p>At the same time, this magic potency accounts for the fact that the revelation is not thought to be meant for everybody’s ears. After pronouncing the word 3 As an instance of the former I see the doctrine of the school of the Śaiva Siddhānta,</p>
<p>which assumes that final release may be obtained through the ritual of initiation, in which the bodily and mental flaws are articulated and magically (i.e. through mantras) collected on a rope in order to be burnt in the sacrificial fire. As an example of the latter may pass Kashmir Saivism, which culminates in the work of the intellectual giant Abhinavagupta.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>Hans Bakker</p>
<p>‘well’ and promising to reveal the divine doctrine, the teacher performs the initiation ceremony of the pupil, who has to take off all his worldly insignia (above, p. 513). From now on he should go naked or with a loincloth only, smeared with ashes, and without any personal belongings. Only then the teacher will impart the revelatioṇ This divides the community of Śiva worshippers (Māheśvaras)</p>
<p>into two, just as in Buddhism—which seems to have been a major source of inspiration to the Pāśupatas anyway: the laymen ( laukikas), whose task it is to gather merit by supporting the order of initiates and by worshipping God in the temple, and the elite group of consecrated ascetics. Only these ascetics are entitled to practise in order to obtain union ( yogavidhi), which is the main subject of the subsequent Sūtras.</p>
<p>The Pāśupata praxis</p>
<p>The imitatio dei</p>
<p>When we have thus seen the lofty religious ideals promulgated by Kauṇḍinya’s gospel, we may be in for a surprise, when we learn more about the specific practices by which these were believed to be realised. On the whole, these practices can be described as an ever steeper staircase to complete effacement of the phenomenal self. In this respect Kauṇḍinya shares many of the ascetic aims and practices that are known from other Indian religions. In all ascetic movements, whether in India or abroad, self-mortification serves to destroy the ego in the expectation that it makes one more susceptible to the divine. In the brahmanical tradition this is generally seen as the unveiling of a true Self, which is itself thought to be godlike. The Pāśupata doctrine is no exception to</p>
<p>this.</p>
<p>The first of five ‘steps of ascension into God’ ( gradus ascensionis in Deum), to paraphrase Bonaventura, 4 requires that the initiated ascetic identifies himself with the deity of his devotion by imitating him, an imitatio dei  that is enacted in the liturgy within the temple. This concerns some aspects of Śiva that are known from the corpus of mythological Sanskrit texts, and this mythology clearly informs the conduct of the ascetic. In this corpus of mythology Śiva often appears as a trickster god, whose loud laughter ( aṭṭahāsa) puts his subjects, including his wife, in their proper place.</p>
<p>But there is another side of Śiva, more ancient, going directly back to the Vedic form of him as Rudra, namely his association with cattle and the bull in particular̥ Paśupati, though in Kauṇḍinya’s gospel used as a metaphor for 4 Bonaventura, Itinerarium mentis in Deum, 1.5–6. The five steps in the career of the Pāśupata ascetic are: 1) living within the precincts of a sanctuary and worshipping Śiva, 2) moving about and seeking dishonour, 3) retreating within a lonely place for meditation, 4) living in the cremation ground until death, 5) the end of suffering through God’s grace.</p>
<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>‘Lord ( pati) of the bound human soul’ ( paśu), literally means ‘Lord of Cattle</p>
<p>( paśu)’. This is a god of nature and fertility, powerful and terrifying, who joined in with the indigenous phallus cult, which sophisticated brahminical thinking transformed eventually into the abstract liṅga. In this aspect, Śiva is associated with the bull, nay, he is the bull. This aspect of his character explains the, at first sight, puzzling injunction in the Pāśupatasūtras where</p>
<p>it says, that the initiate should offer, along with laughter, the sound huḍum</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(PS 1.8). Kauṇḍinya explains: ‘The word huḍuṁ: the auspicious noise which</p>
<p>resembles that of a bull and which originates from holding the tip of the tongue against the palate, that is what (is meant).’ 5</p>
<p>Just as serious is Śiva’s role as fons et origo  of the fine arts, in particular of music and dance. 6 One of the Hindu gods best known to Western audiences is probably Śiva, king of the dance ( naṭarāja). A God who himself dances and sings, then we have really left the world of the Abrahamic religions! The imitatio dei practice of the aspirant consists in laughing loudly, bellowing, and singing and dancing in trance at the right side of the cult image in the sanctum in worship of God. 7 How could one worship Him better than by mimesis?</p>
<p>The temple worship of the initiated ascetic ends with complete absorption in God by the constant muttering of a prayer ( japya), which, seen as a mantra, is, as we have observed above, to be conceived of as His quintessence actualized in the form of sound. This prayer runs:</p>
<p>I resort to the Eternal, Primordial One, Who is Unborn ( sadyojāta), glory, glory</p>
<p>to the Eternal, Primordial One, Who is Unborn!</p>
<p>In existence after existence, not in too many existences, You should be merciful to me, You from Whom existence springs. 8</p>
<p>The seeking of dishonour</p>
<p>Although the initiate ‘looses himself’, so to speak, in his mimetic worship, this is a temporary state. For the second stage of the ascetic’s career Kauṇḍinya prescribes a behaviour that deepens the effacement of the person by a process of self-mortification that goes further than most of the rivalling practices. I 5 Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 1.8. This practice may go back to a Vedic govrata  or anaḍudvrata; see</p>
<p>Acharya 2013.</p>
<p>6 Bhāratīya-Nāṭyaśāstra, chapter 4. Cf. Long 1971, 77.</p>
<p>7 For the significance of ‘the right side’ in this context see Bakker 2004c; above, pp. 505 ff.</p>
<p>8 My translation follows Kauṇḍinya’s interpretation of PS 1.40–44:</p>
<p>sadyojātaṁprapadyāmi sadyojātāya vai namaḥ |</p>
<p>bhave bhave nātibhave bhajasva mām bhavodbhavaḥ  k</p>
<p>This verse (Anuṣṭubh) corresponds to Taittirīya āraṇyaka 10.43. It has some variants</p>
<p>(see Bisschop 2006a, 7 f.), the most important of which is the reading bhavasva  instead of bhajasva. The Mahā-Nārāyaṇa Upaniṣad 17.1 (Varenne 1960, 277–78) reads bhavasva.</p>
<p>This verse is translated by Varenne 1960, 71, with a little too much Cartesian flavour, as: ‘Je cherge refuge auprès du nouveau-né; hommage au nouveau-né! Hommage! Je suis! Je suis! Je n’excelle pas! Sois pour moi! Hommage à celui qui est l’origine de l’existence!’</p>

<p>Hans Bakker</p>
<p>refer to the notorious doctrine of seeking dishonour ( avamāna). To initiate</p>
<p>its discussion in his commentary on PS 3.3, reading ‘despised’ ( avamataḥ ),</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya quotes two verses which are in slightly modified form known from older sources, the Mahābhārata (12.222.20–21) and the Manusmr̥ti (2.162–</p>
<p>163).</p>
<p>The wise brahmin should seek dishonour as if it were ambrosia and he should always beware of honour as if it were poisoṇ For, while being despised, he rests in happiness, excluded from all society; a sage should not think of the faults of the other, (but) always of his own evil. (Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 3.3) Kauṇḍinya’s quotation of older sources in this context and the fact that this stage of the path to salvation dealing with dishonour disappears soon from the repertoire of Śaiva soteriologial texts seem to indicate that we are here concerned with an archaic practice accommodated to the early Pāśupata move-</p>
<p>menṭ 9 The practice involves that the aspirant seeks dishonour when, in public and without making himself known as a Pāśupata ascetic,</p>
<p>He should go about as a mad man, who snores, trembles, limps, leches, and acts and speaks improperly, so that he may come to be ill-treated. For a wise man, being ill-treated, accomplishes thereby all asceticism. (PS 3.11–19) 10</p>
<p>It is to the credit of Daniel Ingalls to have put this weird doctrine into a wider perspective by pointing out its similarity with the practice of dishonour (</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>of the Greek Cynics, in an article that appeared in the Harvard Theological Review in 1962, but which remained largely unknown outside a select group of indologists. As Ingalls points out,</p>
<p>Diogenes’ [‘the Dog’ (</p>
<p>)] favourite method of attracting attention and oppro-</p>
<p>brium, if we are to believe the anecdotes, was by performing in public those acts of nature which should remain hidden: spitting, defecation, and the act of sex.</p>
<p>By means of public censure the Cynics sought to attain hardness, apathy and freedom. 11</p>
<p>And we could go further along the path pointed out by Ingalls. I trust that the reader allows me to take him on a little excursus into the Realm of the Holy Fools, a realm explored most recently in a thesis by Jan Hofstra (2008).</p>
<p>Fools through the Ages</p>
<p>A letter of Paul to the Corinthiers is often seen as a point of departure of this phenomenon in Christianity:</p>
<p>9 Oberlies 2000 points out that this practice, as part of the wider context of the brahmodya, is already attested in the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 2.3.9.9 and that an influence of Cynicism</p>
<p>as argued by Ingalls (see below, p. 554) is very unlikely. Cf. Acharya 2013. In Bakker 2011 (below, p. 553 ff.) I argue that the Pāśupata doctrine, practice and iconography</p>
<p>(Lakulīśa) are to be conceived as orthogenetic.</p>

<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to meṇ</p>
<p>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised. (1 Corintheans 4:9–10) To what extremes this could evolve, we read, for instance, in the Life of Symeon the Holy Fool by Leontios, bishop of Neapolis, Cyprus (first half of 7th century ad):</p>
<p>His entry into the city of Emesa was as follows. Outside the city the illustrious one found a dead dog on a dunghill. He unleashed his cord, tied it to a leg of the dog, and tugged the animal behind him, while he was running through the city gate near the school. 12 . . . By everything he did he suggested to be mad or unbecoming. . . .</p>
<p>He made it his habit, sometimes to limp, sometimes to spring around, or to shuffle on his bottom, or to trip someone up. Sometimes he watched the sky at new moon, upon which he dropped to the ground and began kicking around; sometimes he acted as if he were raving mad. . . . He had become completely incorporeal and innocent with respect to what is appropriate among meṇ When he wanted to answer a call of nature, it often happened that he was ashamed of nobody and defecated at the market square in full view. . . . The blessed one had reached such a degree of purity and sacrosanctity that he often danced and sprung around, having a harlot on each hand. Etcetera. 13</p>
<p>Plate 120</p>
<p>Symeons’s entry into the city of Emesa</p>
<p>12 Contra Hofstra 2008, statement 3 (publicly defended at the University of Groningen on 18 September 2008), this scene cannot be explained from the Scala Paradisi 29/ 14, but is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Cynics.</p>

<p>We could continue to the yurodivyj (rodivy˘</p>
<p>i) of the Russian Orthodox</p>
<p>Church, but it might be wise to return to the Pāśupata and to explain what is</p>
<p>common to its tradition of seeking dishonour ( avamāna) and apparently similar</p>
<p>practices in the Greek and Christian traditions, and what is differenṭ Common to all traditions, it would seem to me, is the feeling of ecstatic power, when freedom from all forms of (social) bondage is experienced, when the social ego is destroyed. It is the</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>of which the Cynics speak, and</p>
<p>which, for modern man, has been worded brilliantly by Thomas Mann in his Magic Mountain (Der Zauberberg):</p>
<p>Da seine Betrachtungen dumpf und verworren waren, so ist es schwer, sie zu prä-zisiereṇ Haubtsächlich schien ihm, daß die Ehre bedeutende Vorteile für sich habe, aber die Schande nicht minder, ja daß die Vorteile der letzteren geradezu grenzenlo-ser Art seieṇ Und indem er sich probeweise in Herrn Albins Zustand versetzte und sich vergegenwärtigte, wie es sein müsse, wenn man endgültig des Druckes der Ehre ledig war und auf immer die bodenlosen Vorteile der Schande genoß, erschreckte den jungen Mann ein Gefühl von wüster Süßigkeit, das sein Herz vorübergehend zu noch hastigerem Gange erregte. 14</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya describes at length the supernatural powers that the aspirant attains in the course of his ascetic training. However, the Sūtras that form the</p>
<p>introduction to his treatment of dishonour run: ‘He gives his bad karma  to them and from them he takes their good karma.’ (PS 3.8–9). The provocations that apparently heap shame upon the practioner induce a transfer of merit: the provoked bourgeois, who is tricked into mistaking the ascetic for a madman, looses good karma  due to his mistake, which karma  is booked at the karma credit side of the Pāśupata: a sort of credit swap avant la lettre. This highly individualistic motive, or should we say immoral, selfish ideology, although still well recognizable in its present-day forms, makes the gospel of Kauṇḍinya stand out amongst its sorṭ</p>
<p>The question arises whether this second stage of the Pāśupata praxis is also</p>
<p>to be seen in the perspective of the imitatio dei, which so clearly informed the first one. I think this is possible, although the antinomian praxis evidently had a long history outside the Pāśupata movemenṭ But antinomian behaviour suited</p>
<p>certain aspects of Śiva very well. From Vedic times Rudra-Śiva has been seen as an outsider, a dangerous god that should be kept at a distance. To propitiate him he was given the name ‘the auspicious one’ (i.e. śiva). His provocative</p>
<p>and nonconformist conduct is well expressed in one of the paradigmatic Śaiva myths: ‘Śiva in the Pine Forest’ (Devadāruvana). This myth differs significantly</p>
<p>in various sources, but I present here the epitome given by O’Flaherty: 15</p>
<p>Śiva then wandered into the Pine Forest, and the wives of the sages there fell in love with him and followed him everywhere. Śiva was naked, ithyphallic, dancing, and begging with a skull in his hand. The sages became furious and cursed his li ˙</p>

<p>to fall to the ground. The li ˙</p>
<p>nga  fell but began to cause a terrible conflagration; Brahmā and Viṣṇu tried in vain to find the top and bottom of it, and peace was only restored when the sages agreed to worship the li ˙</p>
<p>nga, together with their wives.</p>
<p>Antinomian conduct has remained a feature of Śaiva ascetics until the present day.</p>
<p>Kauṇḍinya’s eschatology</p>
<p>Like the aspirant, we should leave this provocative, foolish phase in the discipline behind us and move on towards the final goal. The next step in the career of the practitioner is to retreat into solitude, which ends in his move to the cremation ground. By chosing this, for ordinary Hindus most pollutive and horrifying place, as his last residence on earth (while still alive), the accomplished Pāśupata saint proves his complete detachment from all earthly things.</p>
<p>Like God Himself, he has transcended the relative world of opposites, of pure and impure, of good and evil, and as a monad, steeped in meditation, he awaits the moment that God’s grace will fall upon him and his suffering comes to an end. This signals in the completion of the practice of imitatioṇ With this, at the moment of death, the saint becomes god.</p>
<p>The Pāśupatasūtras finish when the divine speaker, that is Śiva the author of the Sūtras, instructs the practitioner in the penultimate stage to meditate on Him by repeating the following prayer:</p>
<p>The Lord of all knowledge/ spells, the Master of all beings/ spirits; the Overlord of brahman, God (Brahmā), (who is) the Overlord of the demiurge</p>
<p>(Brahmā), Eternal Śiva (Sadāśiva), He must be (for ever) auspicious ( śiva) toward</p>
<p>me! 16</p>
<p>This is followed in the Calcutta manuscript by the syllable oṁ, 17 which should</p>
<p>be seen in this context as a declaration of affirmation, amen, from the side of God. Kauṇḍinya too, although he apparently omits this syllable om., seems to take this prayer in an eschatological way. The fact that God Himself instructs the devotee to entreat Him to be gracious holds a great promise: the end of suffering is at hand; it will be realized at the moment of death (the last stage) and will be for ever̥ Typical for Kauṇḍinya’s style, this vision of hope is prompted by a question:</p>
<p>16 Tai ā 10.47 (= Mahānārāyaṇa Upaniṣad 17.5 (Varenne 1960, 285–86)). This mantra/ brahman  is found in PS 5.42–47 with some variatioṇ I follow the Calcutta ms (C) that conforms to the Tai ā text (Bisschop 2006a, 18):</p>
<p>īśānaḥ sarvavidyānām īśvaraḥ sarvabhūtānām</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>brahmādhipatir brahmaṇo ’dhipatir brahmā śivo me astu sadāśivom |</p>
<p>17 See Bisschop 2006a, 18. oṁalso in the Tai ā text, see note above.</p>
<p>550</p>
<p>Hans Bakker</p>
<p>‘Is it so that here (in this gospel), that is in this prayer, only the majesty of the Creator 18 with respect to the created world ( kārya) is considered, but not the as-</p>
<p>pirant’s longing for or obtaining of (Śivahood)?’ The answer is ‘No’. Just because He sees that those who are not yet in His ultimate grace, due to their office of being aspirant, lack Śivahood/blessedness ( aśivatva), while those who have reached (the</p>
<p>ultimate) state of being without suffering possess Śivahood/ blessedness, He proclaims this last Sūtra. The words in this Sūtra ‘(He) must be’ express a wish: he</p>
<p>wishes, he is longing, he pursues. . . . And because it is the Eternal Śiva (Sadāśiva)</p>
<p>who gives the instruction, the state of being without suffering ( duḥ khānta) is eter-</p>
<p>nal. (Here) ends His office of Creator̥ Therefore it is certain: this end of suffering is for good. (Kauṇḍinya ad  PS 5.45–47)</p>
<p>This doctrine, scholastic, technical, and elitist as it may be, of a personal gracious God, who has descended to earth in order to save all those from suffering who have the courage and stamina to give up their own person for the sake of attaining Him, was something of a religious revolution in the first centuries ad in northern India.</p>
<p>In one important aspect the imitatio dei  of the Pāśupata differs from other</p>
<p>practices of this sort in later Hinduism as well as in Christianity. The imitation of the ascetic is meant to efface all human individuality, to destroy the ego and all worldly sensual experiences. Along this path, accessible only to ascetic virtuosi, the imitatio  ends in an aequatio. The human soul, the paśu, as such</p>
<p>ceases to exist; it has ‘transubstantiated’ into god. As so many products of the Indian mind, this ideal has never vanished, but remained part and parcel of the Indian cultural heritage. However, it has become relatively marginalized and eclipsed by modern forms of mass devotion, in particular by Vaiṣṇava bhakti.</p>
<p>Modern forms of Hindu devotion</p>
<p>I would like to finish with a few words on these modern forms of Hindu worship.</p>
<p>We may say that the idea of the imitation of god as a path to reach him has retained a normative value in Saivism, Vaisnavism and Hinduism in general, ever since its earliest formulation in the Pāśupata religioṇ We have limited</p>
<p>ourselves here to an early Śaiva movement, but instances of the imitatio dei practice within modern Vaisnavism are not hard to come by.</p>
<p>One could even maintain that the modern devotional schools of Viṣṇu worship are nothing but imitations of the divine play ( līlā/ krīḍā), be it the sports</p>
<p>of Rāma and Sītā in Ayodhyā, or those of Kr̥ṣṇa and Rādhā in Braj. In order</p>
<p>to enact the eternal līlā, devotees make pilgrimages to the places where the mythology is believed to be topographically embedded. It is a strategy practised by hundreds of millions to remove the painful separation ( viraha) of the human soul and God. In contrast to what the Christian pilgrim may experience 18 I read kāraṇa  instead of karaṇa.</p>
<p>28 / The Gospel of Kauṇḍinya</p>
<p>551</p>
<p>on the Via Dolorosa in Jerusalem, the imitation of Kr̥ṣṇa in Braj and Vrindavan usually results in great exuberance. Modern Hinduism, in particular Vaiṣṇava bhakti, is a religion celebrating the joys of life rather than its sufferings (cf.</p>
<p>above, p. 17). It is this character, unexpected as it may be to some readers, especially after reading this essay—it is this life-affirming attitude, which seeks to imitate the sports of a happy  god, that sat in the way of a warm reception by Christian missionaries. It made Hinduism in the eyes of many of them a shallow, silly, and naive religion, a too childish way of life to compare in earnest with the grave and deadly serious, revealed religion whose ceremonialism emphasized the doleful side of life and banished, like the Pāśupata faith, the end</p>
<p>of suffering to a realm beyond death.</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Comparison is central to the systematic study of religioṇ The comparative method, however, carries a great risk.</p>
<p>As the scope widens, the collected</p>
<p>insights tend to become more shallow and this not infrequently results in an arid display of learnedness. A balance should be struck between collecting comparable phenomena in different religions and bringing to light the great divisions that do exist, despite superficial resemblances. It will not lead us to the essence of religion, but it will enhance our understanding and debunk absolute claims, since it is due to explode naive ethnocentricity and academic parochialism. Thus is the task of the historian of religion, and this task has been accomplished in an exemplary way by Jan Bremmer in his distinguished career as professor of religious studies.</p>
<p>Many scholars in the humanities today will agree that god as an entity is unwarranted. God is not an ontological category in the sense of an ens realissimum, but a human ideal, that is a mental, social and cultural figuration that gives meaning to life and guides the conduct of the community of believers. As such, the idea of god, which a community creates and sustains, is quintessen-tial to the culture of that community. For this reason the study of religion is such a rewarding enterprise: it allows us access to key notions of a culture. A comparative perspective may help to bring these notions into prominence.</p>
<p>I wrote, the conception of god guides the conduct of the believer, and nowhere is this more obvious than in the practice of imitating god.</p>
<p>Look</p>
<p>at the ritualized behaviour of the believers and you will find their idea of god.</p>
<p>Look at the idea of god and you will understand the behaviour̥ Imitation of god is at the heart of every traditional, religious society, of Christianity as much as of Hinduism. To emulate a happy god brings greater happiness among the faithful; to emulate a suffering god may offer more consolation in our dark-est hours, or, in the words of the Goncourt brothers (1 December 1860): ‘La religion chrétienne sert quand on pleure.’ 19</p>
