Vācaspati Miśra II, in his Nyāyatattvāloka, says that only Brāhmaṇa has adhikāra in Nyāya śāstra.

Also interesting to note that both him and Vācaspati Miśra I, had to explain how sage Gautama taught Nyāya to even those who, as per them, had no adhikāra in it, like Śūdras. They typically 'justify' the sage by mentioning his power, which could destroy the pāpa incurred on account of teaching it to non-adhikārī people.

If the sage had marked it as a problem, wouldn't he have mentioned it clearly to his disciples who were to propagate the śāstra? We might have even found an 'apaśūdrādhikaraṇa' in Nyāyasūtras. If the sage himself didn't state specifications of such sort, and if they are necessary, did he miss foreseeing the 'negative repercussions' if his disciples replicated his conduct?
