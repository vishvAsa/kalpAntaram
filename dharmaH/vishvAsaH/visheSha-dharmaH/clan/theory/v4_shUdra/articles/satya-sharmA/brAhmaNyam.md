## ब्राह्मण-विकाराः

> तस्माद्वर्णा ऋजवो ज्ञातिवर्णाः

एकं साम यजुरेकमृगेका
विप्रश् चैको निश्चये तेषु सृष्टः ॥ ४७

> यस्मात् त्रिषु वर्णेषु ब्राह्मणो यज्ञस्रष्टा

In this Mahābhārata's verse, as per Nīlakaṇṭha's commentary, it's been said that all varṇas are related to each other like one family  
because they are all transformations of Brāhmaṇas,  
as in cases of Mūrdhābhiṣikta and so forth, where Kṣatriya and other varṇas get mixed with Brāhmaṇa varṇa. 

Others get connected with Brāhmaṇas through yajñas. 

Nīlakaṇṭha goes a step further and says that if one gets to the root, all are Brāhmaṇas. 

> Just as one 'akāra' gets transformed into sāman, etc., similarly one Brahman alone becomes Brāhmaṇa & so forth.

From Mahābhārata, Śāntiparvan, 60.

## RShis?
Two interesting cases where Ṛṣis were addressed as 'Śūdrāputra' and 'Dāsīputra', being declared 'Abrāhmaṇa-s'. Eventually the Ṛṣis proved their power.

Vatsa Kāṇva is called 'Śūdrāputra' by Medhātithi Kāṇva.  
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa is called 'Dāsīputra' by Ṛṣis.

The case of Kavaṣa is further interesting because his father Ilūṣa isn't mentioned as a Ṛṣi either by Ṣaḍguruśiṣya or Sāyaṇa. Interesting to note that Sāyaṇa does not mention Ilūṣa, the father of sage Kavaṣa as a Ṛṣi in his commentary on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 8.1. He calls Kavaṣa 'son of a man called Ilūṣa'. For Sāyaṇa, the reason why other sages called him non-Brāhmaṇa, was his being a gambler (Kitava). For Ṣaḍguruśiṣya, they called him so because he did not practise the sadācāra like sandhyāvandana, etc. Nevertheless, the sage showed his power, and his purity and divinity was recognised by the other sages.

This might be the reason why Manu uses an adjective 'Brahmayonistha' for Brāhmaṇas (MS 10.74), who could take up the specific 6 livelihoods meant for Brāhmaṇas. 'Brahmayonistha' means born of Brāhmaṇa parents. From PoV of MS 10.5, this adjective is superfluous. There, a Brāhmaṇa is, for instance, defined as the one born of Brāhmaṇa parents (wedded in a proper manner). The 2 instances mentioned above may indicate a wider usage of the term 'Brāhmaṇa'.
