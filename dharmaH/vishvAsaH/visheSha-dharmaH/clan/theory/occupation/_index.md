title: Occupation differences
---


## Intro
The dvija-s had to compulsorily have appropriate saMskAra-s, and pursue study of sacred lore (adhyayana), yajJNa (sacrifice) and dAna (giving).

Everyone could live of family wealth. 

> स्वकर्म ब्राह्मणस्याऽध्ययनमध्यापनं यज्ञो याजनं दानं प्रतिग्रहणं दायाद्यं सिलोञ्छः ॥ ५॥ अन्यच्चाऽपरिगृहीतम् ॥ एतान्येव क्षत्रियस्याध्यापनयाजनप्रतिग्रहणानीति परिहाप्य दण्डयुद्धाधिकानि ६ क्षत्रियवद्वैश्यस्य दण्डयुद्धवर्जं कृषिगोरक्ष्य वणिज्याऽधिकम् ॥ …

इत्यादिभ्यो दायाद्यं, अपरिगृहीत-ग्रहणं च सर्वेषां सिद्धम्।  
एवं स्वसम्पत्त्या सुखं वस्तुम् अर्हन्ति स्म द्विजाः। 



- Initially, professions for additional earnign were these:
    - teaching and scholarship in sacred lore, accepting gifts, conducting sacrifices (brAhmaNa-s) 
    - governance and defence (kShatriya-s) 
    - commerce, agriculture, etc.. (vaiShya-s) 
    - service, agriculture etc.. (shUdra-s).
- Effectively partly through later Apaddharmas: Most occupations were open to all jAti-s or varNa-s.
- Consequently, there is difference in AchAra-s.
- The brAhmaNa-s were barred from overt pursuit of wealth. (This was not a mere ideal, but was actually practiced -- as observed by many people, including PV kANe.)
- In contrast with early Arya society, shUdra-s of later times were recognized to have the avocation of service and agriculture.

## Major prohibitions of dvija-s
- Crossing the seas and visiting/ inhabiting kalinga vanga etc.. - See [seas](../seas/) page.
