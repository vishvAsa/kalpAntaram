## मांसादौ विश्वासः
In accordance with culture and current knowledge of healthy nutrition, stay ovo-lacto-vegetarian (in the absence of nirUDha-pashubandha observance). Avoid food cooked with same cutting boards and knives as fresh meat.


## Factors towards vegetarianism.
- Historical reasons. Why do many types of hindu-s not eat meat? Because their parents and relatives did not eat meat, and they have no idea why, and it is now a matter of cultural identity. Ok, why did this practice start and why was it sustained?

- Primary reasons:
  - the theory that food influences feelings and behavior, in a way not appropriate for these peoples' traditional vocations. Meat is \_supposedly\_ rAjasika-tAmasika-guNa-pradhAna.
  - The karma theory: a person who eats meat will—in his next birth—become the meat eaten by that animal (Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 9.6.1.3).
- Secondarily, the veda-s and other holy texts urge non-violence as described [here](../../social-cultivation/violence/) (barring exceptions).
- Additional reasons
  - Sustainability
