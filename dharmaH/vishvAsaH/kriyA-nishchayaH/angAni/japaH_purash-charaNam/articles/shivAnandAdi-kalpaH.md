How to perform purascharana- simple guidelines
Hari Om.

This article aims to provide some general guidance for anyone considering a mantra purascharana (also written by some as 'purushcharana'). These writings are based on the teachings of my Guru Swami Sivananda (of the Divine Life Society, Rishikeh).

## What is a purascharana?

A purascharana is primarily an extended mantra recitation practice. It involves recitation of a mantra as many lakhs (100,000) times as there are syllables in the mantra.

E.g. A five syllable mantra such as Om Namah Shivaya requires 5 lakh japa (5 x 100,000).

A 24 syllable mantra such as the Gayatri mantra requires 24 lakh japa (24 x 100,000)

The four traditional components of purascharana are:

1. Japa - as many lakh recitations as there are syllables in the mantra being chanted (as described above)
2. Havan/Homam - fire offering with mantra. Number of mantra recitation needs to be 1/10th the number of japa.
3. Tarpana- water offering with mantra. Number of mantra recitation needs to be 1/10th the number of that done with havan
4. Marjana- water sprinking. Number of mantra recitation is 1/10th the number done with tarpana

After these four steps, feeding of the poor and charitable actions are traditionally undertaken.

Swami Sivananda and other Gurus say that if havan, tarpana and marjana cannot be undertaken in the required amount due to circumstances or other constraints, extra 10% japa of the original purascharana can be undertaken instead- and then charitable actions can be done.


## Purpose of purascharana

This can be undertaken for spiritual progress or a specific material purpose. Spiritual purposes are regarded as best- the result of such purascharana is to develop bhakti and feel the presence of God at all times. This enables one to attain the final goal of life- liberation, one-ness with God, freedom from the pains of samsara and eternal peace, wisdom and bliss.

## Rules and purascharana

One usually needs to follow some rules as far as possible when undertaking purascharana- these relate to diet, conduct and so on (see below).

One should not avoid doing purascharana because one cannot follow every rule. This is very important. The name of God is immensely purifying and can be taken in any state, pure or impure. As Sivananda says, there is gain and gain alone in doing japa. If you cannot follow the rules regarding diet etc, do not worry. Just start the japa in whatever way possible, and the rest will naturally follow in time.

## How many purascharanas?

It is worth starting with one at least. After that one can decide how one feels about doing more. In general one may have to do several purascharanas to attain God, as per Sivananda. This is because much purification of mind is needed through the mantra recitation. All negative emotions such as anger, greed, lust, pride, jealousy etc have to be gradually eradicated and the opposite virtues cultivated. Only a pure mind can attain God. Hence prolonged practice is required. The Gurus say a sincere seeker can achieve this in one lifetime however. In fact, they command us to utilise our precious human life, which is very difficult to get, to  achieve the goal in one lifetime.

## General tips for purascharana:

This is a simple basic set of guidelines for anyone considering a purascharana. They are based on the teachings of Gurus such as Sivananda and others.

1. Attempt to follow the yamas and niyamas (or yogic ethics) to the best of your ability. Without trying to practice these, one can make no progress on the spiritual path. This is the foundation of yoga. Your sadhana will help you get better and better at practicing yama and niyama so do not worry if you cannot practice these perfectly. Perfect practice of Ahimsa, Satya etc is only possible for the Self Realised anyway. One should make a valiant attempt to practice these, however, even as a beginner on the spiritual path.This shows at least that one accepts and commits to developing these ideal virtues.

For a description of yama and niyama, see my article dated May 1, 2018 (link below)

2. Obtain a mala (most have 108 beads), or a watch, to keep count of mantra recitations. Purascharana requires exact precise recording of mantra done. Keep a diary- write down daily how many recitations of the mantra were done using watch/mala. Pronounce the mantra clearly, and not-too-slow and not-too-fast (For instance, it takes me 5 minutes on average to do one mala comfortably. I keep a diary of how many malas were done daily).

3. Decide how many recitations/malas of the mantra you will do per day. Decide over what period of time you will complete the purascharana. (For example it takes me two years on average to do one purascharana of my mantra).

As far as possible, aim to do the same number of malas/recitations every day, not more, not less. This creates a good habit in the mind and helps long-term commitment to do mantra. If there is a crisis/some reason why the number of malas cannot be done, do not worry- but do at least one mala on that day or even a few recitations. If there is an ongoing problem, one can reduce the number of daily malas and increase again once the issue has resolved. However, once the purascharana begins, no day should pass without recitation of the mantra even if just a few times. No break in daily japa should take place as far as possible.

4. Try to eat a sattvic clean diet- reduce or eliminate meat/eggs/rajasic foods as much as possible. Favour sattvic foods- vegetables (not fried), fruits, grains, lentils, dairy. Do not be too extreme with this or the mind will rebel, but do not be too lax either or the mind will take undue advantage.

5. As far as possible, try to do japa at the same place and same time daily. If not possible, do not worry. Do sadhana anywhere, at any time, but do sadhana.

6. Decide whether you wish to repeat the mantra mentally, whisperingly (lips moving, no audible sound) or verbally. Doing one or a mixture of these is acceptable- whatever feels natural and comfortable.

7. Select a concentration point to focus on when repeating the mantra verbally or as a whisper. When you do mental japa, your mind focuses on the sound alone, there is no room for visualisation. Mental japa is considered more powerful that audible/whispering, but the key here is concentration. If you can hear the mantra better verbally compared to mentally, then repeat the mantra verbally. Ability to repeat the mantra clearly mentally will come as the mind becomes purified. (I personally repeat the mantra verbally- I like doing this alongside visualising the form of my Ishta Devata and sometimes doing manasik puja alongside).

Choose as your concentration point either the point between the eyebrows (ajna chakra) or the centre of the chest (anahata heart chakra). Here, visualise either light or the form of the deity whose mantra you are repeating (eg Narayana/Shiva/Durga etc)– or something that represents the Divine to you. If you do not like visualising, that is fine- simply repeat the mantra and focus on the sound alone. Sit in a suitable asana – sukhasana or other – and keep the spine relaxed but straight when doing the practice.

8. Before starting any japa session, recite some slokas. Include a mantra or short invocation to Ganesh and Guru (Teaching Principle of God; may not may not involve a human form, depending on whether or not you have chosen a Guru for yourself), and then repeat some prayer verses to the deity whose mantra you are repeating for the purascharana. 

For example, I say 

> “Om Gum Ganapataye Namah. Om Dum Durgayai Namah. Om Hreem MahaLakshmyai Namah. Om Aim Sarasvatyai Namah. Om Shri Gurave Namah. Om Namo Bhagavate Sivanandaya. Om Samastah Gurubhyo Namah. Om Namah Sivaya. Om Sri Ramaya Namah. Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Om Narayanaya Vidmahe, Vasudevaya Dhimahi, Tanno Vishnu Prachodayat. 

This may sound a bit long/odd, but it suits me, takes about 2 minutes and focuses my mind. So select some prayers that you like and repeat them.

9. Decide clearly the purpose of your purascharana. It is good to have some goal in mind. Spiritual goals are best, ideally, acquisition of true love for God/bhakti, knowledge of God/jnana and mukti/liberation from the ego/attainment of God consciousness. Also dedicate this practice to world peace and the welfare of all. You are one with God, and God is all, so ultimately this means you are dedicating your sadhana to your true self which is all.
