      <description>&lt;p&gt;(For other techniques, see &lt;a href=&#34;../../sources&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If one is interested to prepare Srichurnam on his own, here is the method to prepare it. This method of preparing Srichurnam has been carried forward for generations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take few pieces of Gundu Manjal/ Turmeric (Not Kasturi Manjal), as shown in the picture above. In this case, lets take 8 pieces of Gundu Manjal&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One small tumbler(azhaaku) of rice. (8:1 Ratio – Manjal:Rice)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Soak both the Manjal and Rice in water for 8 hours&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;After 8 hours, filter out water completely&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start crushing it coarsely by using stone (idi kal) or by Mixie. While doing this (The consistency will be similar to preparing adhirsam maavu)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Powder the mixture to make it finer/smoother&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use a thin(melisu) Veshti/cloth and filter out the granules.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Again make the mixture even finer, by grinding it in mixie. Repeat step 6 and 7 until it becomes finer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Mix crushed ‘edible camphor’ (pachchai karpooram) with the powdered mixture.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you need to prepare red Srichurnam, mix vengaram (a variety of alum) / padikaaram (alum), salt and lime.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Dry it in a place where there is no direct sunlight on it and transfer it into a box.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note: For yellow Srichurnam skip step 10 and for red Srichurnam step 10 has to be followed&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Source: Vijay B (a familiar friend), 2016. Location: Santa Clara CA and India.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My 1 year son had lead poisoning (very high levels within 1 month) from yellow-srichUrNam that was store bought (sent from India).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery&#34;&gt;Discovery&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started applying thiruman on 1st birthday. Was on vacation in India so applying daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was chewing on paint chips on a visit to India.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;So when we went back I got a preventive lead test done. Came positive (12 mcg/dL). We thought it was the paint. Back in US, I was probably not applying tirumaN daily - but only on weekends when I was at home.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Hazards of Synthetic Sindoor&lt;br&gt;&#xA;October 1, 2004&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BY TIRTHO BANERJEE&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The recent New Jersey case in which a couple and their 13-year-old child were diagnosed with serious lead poisoning due to regular consumption of sindoor as a food coloring has come as a shock. Sindoor was never meant for use in any type of eatable. Sindoor or kumkum as it is known in the South, is meant for use as a forehead mark, referred to as tilak, bindi or pottu, put on the spot between the brows which is considered the seat of latent wisdom, the ajna chakra. The case highlights modern cosmetic manufacturers’ use of synthetic and often dangerous materials for making sindoor, which are harmful, even when just used for ornamentation&lt;/p&gt;</description>
