Actually, we know the Proto-Indo-Europeans themselves created murtis and worshipped them. However, because they were semi-nomadic people who kept moving, it wasn't practical to have proper temples with established murtis. As a result, murti-puja isn't a thing in the Vedic Hindu religion, it only spreads and becomes a thing by the time (surprise, surprise, India has urbanized into a proper civilization, making temples practical) of the Mauryan Dynasty.
