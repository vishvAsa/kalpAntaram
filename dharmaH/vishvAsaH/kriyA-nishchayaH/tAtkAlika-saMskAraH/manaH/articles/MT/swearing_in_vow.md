This occidental custom of swearing by a religious text is interoperable among Abrahamists -- after all their texts are conceptually equivalent across them. However, it raises interesting questions for H. Old H would not swear by a text but by their foot (e.g., in the rAmAyaNa). 

But if H had to chose a text which one would it be? 
I'd probably do so on a vaidika saMhitA, ideally one I've studied. 

But would say a saiddhAntika shaiva chose the nishvAsa-saMhitA, etc.
