Richard K. Paynei
INTRODUCTION Shugendō (種験道) is a religious tradition that centers on the practice of austerities in remote mountainous settings.1 Several mountains in Japan—Fuji, Omine, Haguro, for example—provided the ritual worlds in which various Shugendō confraternities practiced and served to define the different confraternities from one another. Contemporary practitioners (shugenja 種験者, or gyōja 行者, also popularly called yamabushi 山伏) claim that its origins date back to the earliest history of Japan,2 and the tradition continues to play an important part in contemporary Japanese religious culture.3 Although it can be considered “indigenous” in the sense that it originated in Japan, over the course of its history Shugendō has been molded by other praxes, perhaps most particularly by esoteric Buddhism. Over the centuries Shugendō practitioners actively borrowed both conceptual and ritual elements from religious Daoism and esoteric Buddhism alike.4 One of its most dramatic rites, and one of the most easily recognized, is the saitō goma (柴燈護摩),5 an outdoor ritual in which votive offerings are made into large bonfires, the fires having being ritually transformed into the bodies of the deities evoked. The saitō goma exemplifies the appropriation and adaptation of esoteric Buddhist practice into Shugendō practice, and it provides a case study for an examination of the processes of ritual adaptation from one tradition into another.6">

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Shugendō (種験道) is a religious tradition that centers on the practice of austerities in remote mountainous settings.1 Several mountains in Japan—Fuji, Omine, Haguro, for example—provided the ritual worlds in which various Shugendō confraternities practiced and served to define the different confraternities from one another. Contemporary practitioners (<em>shugenja</em> 種験者, or <em>gyōja</em> 行者, also popularly called <em>yamabushi</em> 山伏) claim that its origins date back to the earliest history of Japan,2 and the tradition continues to play an important part in contemporary Japanese religious culture.3 Although it can be considered “indigenous” in the sense that it originated in Japan, over the course of its history Shugendō has been molded by other praxes, perhaps most particularly by esoteric Buddhism. Over the centuries Shugendō practitioners actively borrowed both conceptual and ritual elements from religious Daoism and esoteric Buddhism alike.4 One of its most dramatic rites, and one of the most easily recognized, is the <em>saitō goma</em> (柴燈護摩),5 an outdoor ritual in which votive offerings are made into large bonfires, the fires having being ritually transformed into the bodies of the deities evoked. The <em>saitō goma</em> exemplifies the appropriation and adaptation of esoteric Buddhist practice into Shugendō practice, and it provides a case study for an examination of the processes of ritual adaptation from one tradition into another.6</p>
<h2 id="historical-connections-between-shugendō-and-esoteric-buddhism">HISTORICAL CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SHUGENDŌ AND ESOTERIC BUDDHISM</h2>
<p>Highlighting some of the historical connections between Shugendō and esoteric Buddhism will establish the background of the <em>saitō goma</em> as an esoteric ritual borrowed7 into the practices of the mountain ascetics.8 Kūkai (空海, 774–835), the founder of the Shingon (眞言) tradition in Japan, reports that in his youth he engaged in ascetic practices in the mountains, a tradition already active by his time. Indeed, it would appear that his selection of Mount Kōya (Kōyasan 高野山) as the location of his training center was motivated by his earlier practice of austerities in the area prior to his travels to China. Ryuichi Abé notes that Kūkai mentions “in one of his letters that it was during this period of wandering from province to province to visit places associated with ascetic practice that he discovered Mount Kōya.”9 This established a relationship between mountain ascetics and the new center for Shingon training being constructed in what was at that time a remote mountain valley.10</p>
<p>Gorai Shigeru suggests that the cult of Kūkai is itself a manifestation of underlying Shugendō systems of belief regarding the three deities of a sacred mountain: the deity of the mountain itself (<em>nyotai shin</em> 女体神, “female deity”), the original cult leader, who was not a monk (<em>zokutai shin</em> 俗体神, “layman deity”), and the monk who “opens” the mountain (<em>hottai shin</em> 法体神, “monk deity”).11 In this system of three deities, Kūkai is the third focus of the cult, the monk deity. Gorai distinguishes between the historical figure of Kūkai and the cult figure he became, of whom it is claimed that he remains in deep meditation (<em>samādhi</em>) in the mausoleum at O Ku no In on Kōyasan until the coming of the next buddha, Maitreya.</p>
<p>In the medieval period, a mendicant order known as the Kōya <em>hijiri</em> (高野聖), or “holy men of Kōya,” was initiated as a means of raising funds for the rebuilding of the monastic institutions (<em>kanjin</em> 勸進, literally meaning to encourage people to do meritorious actions) on Mount Kōya, many of which had been destroyed by fire.12 There seems to have been a high degree of permeability between the two groups of Kōya <em>hijiri</em> and Shugendō practitioners.13</p>
<p>Gorai notes that Shingon monastic leaders, including some who rose to the position of chief priest (<em>zasu</em> 座主) of Kōyasan, became deeply interested in the cult of the mountain. This parallels the situation in the Tendai tradition, located on Hieizan (比叡山), which also combined a mountain cult and esoteric Buddhist practice.14 Gorai indicates that authority over interpreting the cult was a site of contestation, and that Shugendō lore related to its performance became more complex when it was adopted by the Shingon and Tendai scholar-monks themselves. It also came to be distorted [<em>sic</em>] by Shingon and Tendai doctrine. However the <em>gyōnin</em> and <em>dōshu</em> 堂衆 (that is, the <em>geshu</em>) continued to resist the scholar-monks, as the history of every Shugendō mountain makes clear.15</p>
<p>During the Tokugawa era (1603–1868, also known as the Edo period), the Shogunate required all Shugendō groups to affiliate with a Buddhist order, under its policy of establishing control over all religious institutions. Shugendō groups affiliated with either the Shingon order or the Tendai, which also has a strong esoteric component. Shugendō confraternities thus came under the direct institutional control of Shingon and Tendai temples, which contributed to the increasing systematization of Shugendō practice according to esoteric Buddhist principles.16 This included such central institutional factors as clerical education and ranking, as well as liturgical matters. Shugendō groups borrowed symbolism from tantric Buddhism, such as organizing the cycle of mountain austerities according to the Buddhist cosmological system of the ten worlds of hell-beings, animals, hungry ghosts, humans, titans, gods, arhats, <em>śravaka</em>s, bodhisattvas, and buddhas, and they also employed ritual practices such as initiations or consecrations (<em>kanjō</em> 灌頂, <em>abhiṣeka</em>) that were directly modeled on esoteric Buddhist initiations.17</p>
<p>During the Meiji era (1868–1912), some Shugendō groups suffered repression because of the very affiliation with Buddhism that had been forced on them by the Tokugawa shogunate. The attempt to separate Buddhism from Shintō (<em>shinbutsu bunri</em> 神仏分離), in order to “revive” a putatively native and continuous tradition dating from pre-Buddhist times, led to the destruction of many Buddhist institutions, with consequences for Shugendō as well. Gorai notes that “Shugendo activity ceased for some time after it was banned following the Meiji Restoration [of 1868], and much Shugendo lore was lost.”18 And “[t]‌he destruction associated with the Meiji Restoration often left little at former Shugendo sites beyond stone walls, foundation stones, or the remains of old roads.”19</p>
<p>Following the defeat of Japan in the Pacific War, restrictions on religious freedom established during the imperialistic phase of the Taishō era were lifted under General MacArthur’s mandate. This lead to the inclusion of religious freedom as Article 20 of the 1947 Constitution. Several Shugendō groups that had been quiescent during the first half of the twentieth century reemerged and, with the rising prosperity of the 1960s, the tradition began to flourish once again.20 At the same time these groups were freed of their mandated relation to established Buddhism and this led to the weakening of borrowed symbol systems, such as the ten worlds.21</p>
<h2 id="ten-worlds-symbolism-and-practice">TEN WORLDS: SYMBOLISM AND PRACTICE</h2>
<p>The practice of austerities in the mountains was in some cases, such as at Mt. Omine,22 structured in accord with the version of Buddhist cosmology found in the <em>Avataṃsaka-sūtra.</em> The use of this system indicates the extent to which Shugendō, at least in the medieval period, was indebted to the esoteric Buddhist episteme.</p>
<p>The structure of the ten worlds practice is based on Buddhist cosmology as presented in the <em>Avataṃsaka-sūtra</em> and other sources.23 The system of ten worlds draws on the more familiar six worlds (hells, animals, hungry ghosts, human beings, titans, and gods) and adds four more: the realms of those who hear the teachings (<em>śravaka</em>s), of solitary buddhas (<em>pratyekabuddha</em>s), of bodhisattvas, and of fully enlightened buddhas. As is not uncommon in Buddhist cosmology, it is possible to interpret these either as actual worlds where one may be reborn or as representations of states of mind. The <em>Avataṃsaka-sūtra</em> (<em>Kegongyō</em> 華嚴經) was the central text for the Nara school of Kegon (華厳, Ch. Huayan), but it was also one of the sources on which Kūkai drew extensively in formulating his own system of esoteric Buddhism. Given the institutional relations between Shugendō and Shingon, it is probable that Shugendō integrated the ten worlds system from this source rather than from the much smaller and less influential Kegon school.</p>
<p>The structure of the ten worlds practice begins with the symbolic death of the <em>shugenja</em>, followed by a journey through the ten worlds, culminating in the practitioner’s symbolic rebirth as a buddha.24 Hitoshi Miyake gives a summary of the ten worlds structure of Shugendō practice, including the role of the <em>saitō goma</em>:</p>
<p>Around the fifteenth century, ten practices were made obligatory for anyone engaging in ascetic practice in the mountains: confirming one’s buddha-nature (<em>tokogatame</em> [床堅]), confessing and repenting, weighing one’s karmic bonds (using an actual scale, abstaining from water, fetching water, ritual wrestling (<em>sumo</em>), ritual dancing (<em>ennen</em> [延年]), gathering firewood, abstaining from cereals, the outdoor goma ritual (<em>saitō goma</em>) and consecration. Each of these practices was believed to correspond to one of the ten realms, or stages, of existence through which sentient beings pass on their way to final enlightenment: the hells, hungry spirits, beasts, ashuras, human beings, heavenly beings, shravakas, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. It was taught that a shugenja who faithfully performed all the practices corresponding to the ten realms could attain buddhahood in the present body.25</p>
<p>The goal of the ten worlds practice, known as “becoming buddha/awakened in this body” (<em>sokushin jōbutsu</em> 即身成仏), is also the goal of practice for Shingon as well.26 As H. Byron Earhart has said, “Although such Buddhist notions are not unique to Shingon, they probably did derive from Shingon sources, and in Shugendō are expressed in peculiarly Shingon fashion.”27</p>
<h3 id="appropriation-of-the-homa"><em>Appropriation of the</em> Homa</h3>
<p>The context in which Shugendō practitioners established the <em>saitō goma</em> (柴燈護摩) as a central part of their range of praxis is complex. There are many different rituals performed in Japanese folk religion and in Shintō that involve fire, and these ritual practices constitute part of the religious “substratum”28 supporting the development and practice of the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em>. These include practices associated with blessing the domestic cooking hearth, the distribution of “new” fire (created using a fire drill) on the morning of the first day of the new year, and the burning of massive torches in the summer and in the second lunar month.29 While the number of such practices is quite large, the vast majority are unique to particular locales and even to specific shrines and temples.30 A comprehensive genealogy of the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> would have to take all of these folk, popular, and Shintō practices into account. It is quite possible, given this rich ritual cultural milieu, that the <em>saitō goma</em> as it is practiced today was based on preexisting ritual practices that were then codified in light of esoteric Buddhist symbolism and ritual forms.</p>
<p>A further complicating factor, however, is the difficulty of establishing the history of these practices. Indeed, contemporary Japanese religion provides several instances of newly created forms (Imperial funerals, <em>omizuko,</em> seven lucky gods, and state Shintō) being presented as having ancient origins, and this rhetoric of antiquity is accepted uncritically so that the more recent origins of the tradition are obscured.31 Whatever the complexities of this history, the relation between the <em>saitō goma</em> and the variety of practices found in Japanese folk religion is an important contextual framework.32</p>
<p>In one of his discussions of fire rituals in Shugendō, Miyake employs two categories: “fire ceremonies for averting misfortunes” and <em>saitō goma</em>. The former is a <em>homa</em> performed for protection (<em>śāntika, sokusai,</em> 息災), the same categorization used in Shingon. Miyake identifies it as a kind of “prayer” and his summary description of the ritual applies equally well to other <em>homa</em> rites:</p>
<p>The <em>goma</em> fire ritual is a form of Shugendo prayer. A certain liturgy is performed, including various chants, before and while the fire is burnt. Offerings are burnt in the fire for the object of worship (<em>sūhai taishō</em> 崇拝対象), usually Fudō Myōō, and prayers are offered for the realization of certain requests.33</p>
<p>Elsewhere Miyake discusses the religious goal of the <em>saitō goma</em> per se:</p>
<p>The <em>Saitō goma shidai</em> (Procedure for Saitō Goma [柴灯護摩次第]) too describes the <em>saitō goma</em> as a unique Shugendō soteriological ritual for incinerating the this-worldly body that is riddled with defilements and entering the original and unborn letter “a” (which symbolizes the unity of the cosmos), through the actions of the various buddhas associated with the five wisdoms.34</p>
<p>Mention of “the original and unborn letter ‘a’” is another clear indication of direct esoteric Buddhist influence on Shugendō thought. The symbolism and significance of the syllable <em>A</em> derives from Indian linguistic symbology. Its religious valence derives from its ability to symbolically represent the creation, maintenance, and dissolution of the universe simultaneously. As the first syllable of the Sanskrit syllabary, it represents creation. As inherently present in every syllable, it represents maintenance. And as the negative prefix, it represents dissolution. Combined with a cosmogenesis conceived as progressing in the order of the Sanskrit syllabary, and released as the reverse process, the syllable <em>A</em> comes into tantric practice and is carried to Japan as part of the esoteric episteme. The valences of the syllable are dependent upon familiarity with Sanskrit and could not have any origin indigenous to Japan.35</p>
<h3 id="the-saitō-goma"><em>The</em> Sait<em>ō</em> Goma</h3>
<p>The <em>saitō goma</em> is held in the open air, carried out in a large construction of logs about eight to twelve feet long stacked in a square.36 The interior is filled with combustibles, and the exterior is covered over with green boughs, which produce large billows of smoke when the fire is lit. Both the outdoor venue and the size of the fire distinguish the <em>saitō goma</em> from other Shingon <em>homa</em>s, which are performed indoors on permanent altars, with small kindling sticks (about eight to twelve inches long). In some instances <em>saitō goma</em> is performed as a stand-alone ritual, and it is also performed in preparation for fire-walking.37 Once the fire has burned down, the embers are spread out to form the path for the participants to walk across. Fire-walking is one of the “magicospiritual powers” (<em>genjutsu</em> 験術) that accomplished <em>shugenja</em> were supposed to be able to demonstrate. Other such powers included flying, walking on swords (or climbing a ladder of swords),38 becoming invisible (“hiding” one’s body), entering boiling water,39 as well as healing, possession (<em>tsukimono otoshi</em> 憑きものおとし), and exorcism (<em>jōbuku</em> 調伏, the same term used for one category of tantric rituals). These powers serve to connect Shugendō with wider yogic and shamanic practices, and at least in the case of walking on swords, they demonstrate a direct relation with the extraordinary powers attributed to popular Daoist practitioners in China.</p>
<p>As one finds elsewhere when examining the ritual corpus of a particular tradition, a simpler ritual form provides the basis for more complicated ones.40 In the case of the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em>, the ritual that serves as its model is the Fudō hō (不動法). One of the ways to study processes of ritual transformation is to examine the relation between simpler and more complex rituals from within the ritual corpus of a tradition. It seems reasonable to expect that in general the historical direction of development or transformation of ritual forms would be from simpler to more complex, although we cannot simply presume this to be the case in all instances. This is, however, the pattern found in the four rituals of Shingon training. In this case, the eighteen-stage ritual (<em>jūhachidō</em> 十八道) supplies the paradigmatic ritual format that is systematically modified to create each of the other three rituals. This approach—looking within the ritual corpus of a tradition in order to identify systematic patterns of transformation—is endogenous. In contrast, what we are considering here is an exogenous relationship, one in which the ritual paradigms come from outside the tradition. A complete analysis requires taking into consideration both endogenous and exogenous dynamics.</p>
<h3 id="the-saitō-goma-ritual-text"><em>The</em> Sait<em>ō</em> Goma <em>Ritual Text</em></h3>
<p>The particular ritual manual examined here and translated in the appendix is entitled <em>Saitō Fudō goma shidai</em> 柴燈不動護摩次第 and was published by Yoshida Publishing, Yoshida Shōin 吉田書院, of Kōyasan. I purchased it from the publisher in 1983. It is a small accordion-fold manual, which has the mantra in Siddham script, pronunciation guides (<em>furigana</em>), and illustrations of the <em>mudrā</em>s. The undated pamphlet has fifty-seven pages numbered in Roman numerals. The publisher had several such manuals available for purchase, and the open availability of seemingly “esoteric” materials raises issues related to widespread preconceptions regarding the meaning of secrecy for initiatory traditions, at least as they exist in present-day Japan.41</p>
<h2 id="influences-and-borrowings-zürchers-typology-of-relations-between-religions">INFLUENCES AND BORROWINGS: ZÜRCHER’S TYPOLOGY OF RELATIONS BETWEEN RELIGIONS</h2>
<p>A useful step toward understanding the relations between religious traditions, including the adoption and adaptation of ritual praxes, is to establish an adequately nuanced typology of different kinds of relations that may exist between traditions. In his examination of the relations between Buddhism and Daoism in China, Erik Zürcher attempted to give more definition to the vague terms “influence”42 and “borrowing.”43</p>
<p>Zürcher suggests four categories to “distinguish various types or levels of borrowing, even if it is obvious that there are many border cases and that, in principle, even the most formal loans to some extent do affect the content of the message.”44 These categories mark not just differences in quantity or the extent of the borrowing, but differences in the kind of borrowing. These are differences in kind because their ramifications within the development of the tradition that is doing the borrowing differ in kind. Zürcher refers to the first of these categories as “formal borrowing,” which refers to borrowing “elements of Buddhist origin that exclusively or mainly contribute to the verbal and stylistic presentation of the message.”45 Second is “conceptual borrowing,” which occurs, in Zürcher’s discussion, when “a term denoting a well-defined doctrinal concept in Mahāyāna Buddhism” is used in a Daoist context in such a fashion as to retain its original meaning.46 Distinguishing these first two categories requires contextual analysis in order to judge whether something is simply a figure of speech (i.e., a formal loan) or actually represents the intellectual appropriation of a concept.</p>
<p>The third category for Zürcher is “borrowed complexes”:</p>
<p>[T]‌he absorption of a coherent cluster of ideas and/or practices, taken over from Buddhism as a complex in which at least part of the original constituent elements are maintained, even if the interpretation and function of those elements and of the complex as a whole may be quite different from the original ones.47</p>
<p>Finally, there is “pervasive influence,” that is, where “Buddhist ideas and practices … may have contributed to the development of [D]‌aoism without, however, finding … expression in recognizably Buddhist terms.”48 Concerning the category of pervasive influence, Zürcher says that it “is so elusive that at least at this stage of the investigation it is better not to speculate about it.”49 Since Zürcher’s 1980 work, however, knowledge of the two fields of study have improved to the point that work on pervasive influences can be pursued seriously.50</p>
<p>So much of the <em>saitō goma</em> is directly borrowed that we can say that it is, in Zürcher’s terms, a “borrowed complex” that has been adapted by Shugendō practitioners for their own uses. We can, however, move beyond the general statement that esoteric Buddhism is an important influence on Shugendō by examining the specific characteristics of the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> that place it in the category of a borrowed complex.</p>
<p>An important aspect of this analysis of the <em>saitō goma</em> as a borrowed complex is the way in which mantras are used, including not only direct borrowings of a specific mantra in isolation but also larger ritual units of which mantras constitute just one part. One example of the direct borrowing of a specific mantra is the “one-syllable” mantra of Fudō Myōō, used both in the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> and the Shingon <em>soku sai goma:</em></p>
<p>NAUMAKU SAMANDA BAZARA DAN KAN (Skt. <em>namaḥ samanta vajrāṇāṃ hāṃ</em>).</p>
<p>This mantra is employed in the same form in both <em>homa</em>s, for the same purpose of evoking Fudō Myōō.</p>
<p>In several instances the direct link between the two <em>homa</em>s is evident both in terms of the mantra being employed and the ritual action with which it is employed, and these two—mantra and ritual action—constitute a ritual unit, a more complex form than an isolated use of the one-syllable mantra. For example, in both <em>homa</em>s a fan is used to stoke the flames of the votive fire. While doing so, the practitioner visualizes the syllable KAN (<em>khaṃ</em>) written in Siddham script on the surface of the fan. This seed syllable (<em>bīja mantra</em>) is visualized as transforming into the wind element (<em>cakra</em>, lit., “wheel”). In both <em>homa</em>s this action and visualization form a single ritual unit that includes the same mantra:</p>
<p>ON BOKU JINBARA UN (Skt. <em>oṃ bhūḥ jvala hūṃ</em>).</p>
<p>The ritual unit of action, mantra, and visualization is formed from the three components of human existence, body, speech and mind, which is interpreted in Shingon theory as the human reflexes of the three mysteries (<em>sanmitsu</em> 三密), the “three sources of salvation (bodily postures, speech, mental activity).”51</p>
<p>The mantras are systematically adapted to different ritual settings in a fashion that might be described as “quasi-grammatical.” That is, “lexical units” associated with different deities are found in the same locations within a larger mantric frame, and changes in the “lexical unit” effect changes in the mantra as a whole. For example, in the Shugendō <em>saito goma</em> the worldly deities are installed in the hearth of the votive fire with the mantra:</p>
<p>NAUMAKU SAMANDA BAZARA DAN KAN EI KEI KI JAKU UN BAN KOKU SOWAKA.</p>
<p>In the Shingon Fudō Myōō <em>soku sai goma</em>, the chief deity, Mahāvairocana Tathāgata (Dainichi Nyorai 大日如来) is installed together with his retinue with the mantra:</p>
<p>NAUMAKU SAMANDA BODANAN AKU SARABA TAKU HARA CHIKATEI TATAGYATA KUSYA BOJISYARIYA HARI HORAKYA EI KEI KI JAKU UN BAN KOKU SOWAKA.</p>
<p>This quasi-grammatical transformation of one mantra into another, illustrated below, is evidenced throughout Shingon practice, with the changes of the deity evoked and changes of the ritual intent reflected not only in the name found in the mantra but also in the terminal mantric exclamation. In this case, in a protective (<em>soku sai</em> 息災; <em>śāntika</em>) <em>homa</em>, the terminal mantric exclamation is <em>svaha</em> (Jpn. <em>sowaka</em>). The same ritual action of installing the deities when performed in a subordinating (<em>kei ai</em> 敬愛; <em>vaśīkaraṇa</em>) <em>homa</em>, such as the <em>Amida kei ai goma</em>, uses the same mantra but with a different terminal mantric exclamation.</p>
<p>NAUMAKU SANMANDA BODANAN AKU SARABA TARA HARA CHIKATEI TATAGYATA KUSYA BŌJISYARIYA HARI HORAKYA BASYU KYARADA EI KEI KI JYAKU UN BAN KOKU JYAKU.</p>

<p>FIGURE 1</p>
<p>As suggested by the discussion of endogenous and exogenous aspects of ritual adoption and adaptation, the kind of borrowing that we are examining here is not simply unidirectional, from the Shingon <em>homa</em> to the <em>saitō goma</em>. At the same time the development of the Shugendō Fudō hō (不動法), itself also probably based on Shingon models, provided another prototype for the <em>saitō goma</em>. Although analysis necessarily proceeds on the basis of case-by-case comparisons, such comparisons must be held within a larger framework of interaction between traditions and development within traditions.</p>
<h3 id="appropriating-deities-fudō-myōō">Appropriating Deities: Fud<em>ō</em> My<em>ō**ō</em></h3>
<p>The two <em>homa</em>s also share a large number of deities evoked in the course of the ritual, including the group known collectively as the worldly deities. This is a group of originally Vedic deities including such figures as Brahma and Indra. Agni, also a Vedic deity, is individually evoked as the first deity manifest in the fire for both <em>homa</em>s. Fudō Myōō (不動明王; Acalanātha Vidyārāja, also known in Sanskrit as Candamāharoṣaṇa52) is one of the most visible deities in the Shugendō pantheon.53 In present-day Japan, Fudō is venerated in much the same way that are indigenous Japanese deities (<em>kami</em> 神), such as being given offerings of saké by lay devotees. The origins of this figure, however, are in India, and he was brought to Japan as part of the pantheon of tantric Buddhism.54 Fudō, a protector deity, is portrayed as surrounded by flames; he is perpetually in the fire-producing <em>samādhi.</em> This symbolism may have been the basis for his popularity with Shugendō practitioners, who engage in austerities, including cold-water austerities in which interior heat is generated, as in many other shamanic traditions.55</p>
<p>According to Miyake, Fudō is involved in effectively all Shugendō rituals, because it is through ritual identification with Fudō that the <em>shugenja</em> gains sufficient power to perform religious services: “Shugendo rituals begin with the shugenja attaining a spiritual identification with Fudō Myōō, the main deity, and the attainment of the ability to control this spiritual power.”56 In the case of Shugendō’s relation of “influence and borrowing” with esoteric Buddhism, the appropriation of Fudō as a deity extends to ritual structures and organizing metaphors.</p>
<p>Miyake gives a detailed description of the basic Shugendō ritual for the Immovable (Wisdom King) Fudō hō (不動法), based on the manual and explanatory text of the Tendai-affiliated Shugendō Honzan (本山).57 He explains that the rite is structured in accord with the first of the four training rituals of Tendai esoteric Buddhism, known (as in Shingon) as the ritual in eighteen stages (<em>jūhachidō</em> 十八堂). This ritual now entails twenty-two <em>mudrā</em>-mantra ritual complexes, extended from the original eighteen. As presented by Miyake, there are nine stages of the Fudō hō, summarized here:</p>
<p>Analyzed at this level of detail, the ritual structure can be illustrated as in figure 2.</p>
<figure class="">

    <a href="images/00001.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <img src="images/00001.jpeg" alt="images" title="">
    </a>

    

</figure>
<p>FIGURE 2</p>
<p>The diagram reveals the same basic structure that is found in the corresponding Shingon ritual in eighteen stages.59 The opening sequence of preparations and installation of the deity (in this case, Fudō) is followed by the first of two sets of offerings, then ritual identification, the second set of offerings, and leave-taking. As in other rituals of this kind, the ritual is symbolically symmetrical around the act of the practitioner identifying with the chief deity, although the leave-taking step appears abbreviated compared with the opening preparations.</p>
<p>In addition to the deities evoked, the fundamental metaphor organizing the ritual action of the <em>saitō goma</em> is also the same as that found in Shingon <em>homa</em>s—that is, offering a feast to an honored guest. The feast is prepared, the guests invited, they are fed and entertained, they take their leave, and the feast is cleaned up. This fundamental metaphor is historically rooted in Vedic ritual practices.60 By contrast, for example, Daoist rituals are organized on the basis of a different fundamental metaphor, the presentation of a petition to a bureaucratic office. The identity of the fundamental metaphor of feasting an honored guest in both the Shingon and Shugendō <em>homa</em>s is very strong evidence for understanding the <em>saitō goma</em> as a transformation of a tantric Buddhist ritual.</p>
<p>As presented by Earhart, based on his 1963 study of Mt. Haguro Shugendō, the goals of performing the <em>saitō goma</em> and the cosmology that structures thought about the nature and goal of practice were also largely based on those found in esoteric Buddhism.</p>
<p>[The] <em>saitō goma</em> is full of doctrinal and symbolical implications… . One’s sins were burnt up or washed away, his roots of perception were purified, one’s very body was annihilated. Hence one entered <em>nirvāṇa</em> or became a <em>bodhisattva</em>, even a Buddha in the form of Dainichi.61</p>
<p>Thus, the <em>saitō goma</em> was conceived as enabling the practitioner to attain the very highest stage of development possible in the Shingon cosmology, identification with the Dharmakāya Buddha Mahāvairocana.</p>
<h3 id="examining-ritual-change">Examining Ritual Change</h3>
<p>The study of ritual has become an area of research in its own right. The value of such studies, however, lies in the fact that they can reach beyond their initial frameworks to address broader issues in the study of religion, and even extend into other areas of research, such as social behavior and cognition. Such scholarship, however, requires tools that go beyond impressionistic and superficial comparisons of rituals based solely on observation and description. Textual studies of a ritual in historically differentiated instantiations, as the method pursued in other essays in this collection, provides one such tool. Another tool is to consider the structure of a given ritual. In order to examine not just the structure of a single ritual but to compare the structures of different rituals—to establish relations between them that may not be visible on the basis of simple observation—a systematic analytic technique is required. Syntactic analysis is such a technique. Originally developed by analogy with language, the concept of syntax as the systematic structuring of elements over time so as to form a meaningful whole has a broader scope of application as an analytic tool.62</p>
<p>Although the analogy between language and ritual had already been made, Frits Staal appears to have been the first to introduce a specifically syntactic approach to ritual.63 Staal has been widely understood as claiming that “ritual is meaningless,” and on this basis many scholars have been dismissive of his entire project.64 Yet, if we read his work closely, it is clear that Staal does not claim that ritual per se is meaningless, rather that there is an important aspect of ritual that is meaningless, and that aspect is the structural, formal, or as he calls it, syntactic.65 This is no different from the meaninglessness of the sentence structure subject/verb/object. In other words, the syntactic structure of subject/verb/object is empty of <em>inherent</em> meaning, and it is this absence of meaning that makes the syntactic form different from a sentence having this structure, such as “Sam kicked the ball.”66 Ritual syntactic structures are equally meaningless, and indeed the structure is only revealed if we consider the structure alone, separate from any particular meaning. As Ray Jackendoff explains,</p>
<p>The formal difference between actual sentence structures and rules of grammar is that rules contain variables to be instantiated; the utterances one has experienced represent various instantiations of these variables.67</p>
<p>The same is true <em>mutatis mutandis</em> for ritual as well.</p>
<p>The relevance of a syntactic analysis to the broader issues of this collection—the transformation of ritual over time and across the boundaries of religious cultures—is that it allows for a level of analysis that can demonstrate at a very deep level connections between ritual forms, and thereby illuminate the larger histories of ritual systems as they change over time and as they interact with other ritual systems. An analogy might be historical linguistics, which seeks to demonstrate how languages change over time and also to establish the relations between languages.68 Such studies depend upon controlled comparisons between instances of a language from different historical periods, which is, in terms of methodology, comparable to the compilation of this collection of essays.</p>
<p>Just as the study of the history of language reveals aspects of the history of the peoples who spoke that language, so also controlled comparisons of ritual syntax can inform the study of the religious traditions that supported those rituals. Thus, for example, it may be possible eventually to discern historical relations important to the early development of Buddhist tantra in the period between the Vedic and Upaniṣadic eras and the seventh and eighth centuries, when the early texts were being compiled. Given the relative paucity of directly historical texts that recorded events evidencing historical developments, the method proposed here would employ comparisons between ritual practices of the various traditions. Although syntactic change is not the only dynamic studied by historical linguistics, it is one of the most important, representing longer term transformations; therefore, a syntactic study of ritual may reveal similar long-term relations.</p>
<p>The Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> provides a case study for this methodological program. A preliminary syntactic analysis is provided in the diagram in figure 3.</p>

<p>FIGURE 4</p>
<p>At this level of analysis, our attention is drawn to the following similarities and differences between the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> and the <em>goma</em>s commonly found in the Shingon tradition. First, there is no explicit act of ritual identification. Second, although its structure is very similar to that of a Shingon <em>goma</em> in which three sets of offerings are made, the first set in this case, the offering to Agni, does not include any of the set of actions found in the others here: the offering of kindling, fanning the flames, and the offering of oil. Thus, although Agni comes and goes as the first component following the opening preparations, in this case he receives none of the offerings specifically associated with fire. Third, while the manual as given has merely the briefest of closing ritual, it still serves to indicate the symmetry of the ritual, just as in the Fudō hō discussed above. Fourth, an optional set of offerings, for the lord of the assembly and the chief deity, may be inserted into the course of the main set.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>The movement of the <em>homa</em> rite from its Vedic roots into tantric practice in early medieval India required certain transformations, which the essays gathered in this volume have helped to elucidate. The historical study of a ritual as it has been transported into different religious cultures and its modifications in that process provides an instance of ritual transformation over the <em>longue durée</em>. In this essay, we have seen how the Shingon <em>homa</em> provided a model for the development of a <em>homa</em> practiced in the Shugendō tradition.</p>
<p>Building on Zürcher’s ideas about the different qualities of influence and borrowing, four aspects of the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> in relation to the Shingon <em>goma</em> may be highlighted: (1) specific ritual actions, visualizations, and mantras; (2) the deities evoked and the idea of evocation itself; (3) the fundamental metaphor of feasting an honored guest; and (4) the ritual syntax. These four aspects of the Shugendō <em>saitō goma</em> demonstrate the genealogical relation between it and the Shingon <em>goma.</em> Although observation and description can suggest a genealogical relation based on the first three of these four aspects, through syntactic analysis we can explore the underlying ritual structure that can show more fundamental processes of appropriation and adaptation.</p>

<p>Although I am not a linguist, I suspect that while the two may be theoretically distinct (and that the distinction may be heuristically useful), there are significant ways in which they are not. Contrary to the Saussurean legacy in linguistics and philosophy of language, meaning is not purely contrastive in nature, as suggested by the work of Anna Wierzbicka on semantic universals. In particular, see Anna Wierzbicka, <em>Semantics, Culture, and Cognition: Universal Human Concepts in Culture-Specific Configurations</em> (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1992). The structuralist concept of language was itself developed out of phonetic studies employing the tool of “minimal pairs,” in which significant difference is defined by contrast, i.e., meaning is solely dependent upon structure. It is the extension of this phonetic insight to other aspects of language that may be problematic.</p>
