INTRODUCTION In addition to the wealth of Sanskrit manuscripts from their private and monastic archives, which provided the textual foundations of modern Buddhist studies, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley likewise perform a rich repertoire of rituals also originating in later Indic Buddhism. Among them are a large variety of homa rituals done in a Buddhist modality, each with its specific details of performance and purposes. This chapter provides an overview of this Newar Buddhist tradition, including a complete outline of the ritual that was performed at Harvard (by the co-author of this chapter) at the outset of the “Homa Variations” conference at which a brief form of this paper was presented. It will first situate this central ritual tradition in the characteristically complex sociocultural matrix in which Newar Buddhism exists today,1 discuss the basic features of the many extant variants, describe the details of practice, and then conclude with observations of how modern Newar Buddhists conceptualize the Buddhist identity of their homa practices.">

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>In addition to the wealth of Sanskrit manuscripts from their private and monastic archives, which provided the textual foundations of modern Buddhist studies, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley likewise perform a rich repertoire of rituals also originating in later Indic Buddhism. Among them are a large variety of <em>homa</em> rituals done in a Buddhist modality, each with its specific details of performance and purposes. This chapter provides an overview of this Newar Buddhist tradition, including a complete outline of the ritual that was performed at Harvard (by the co-author of this chapter) at the outset of the “Homa Variations” conference at which a brief form of this paper was presented. It will first situate this central ritual tradition in the characteristically complex sociocultural matrix in which Newar Buddhism exists today,1 discuss the basic features of the many extant variants, describe the details of practice, and then conclude with observations of how modern Newar Buddhists conceptualize the Buddhist identity of their <em>homa</em> practices.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background-and-context">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT</h2>
<p>The record of thousands of Sanskrit texts preserved in the Kathmandu Valley contain an archive that, when more fully studied, will clarify the emergence of Newar Mahāyāna-Vajrayāna tradition in the context of later Indic Buddhist history, a development that culminated and died out across the plains of the Indus-Gangetic region itself. Just as Nepal is a direct descendent of the artistic traditions that were found to its immediate south in the later Pala-Sena regions, so too do its texts reflect this former connection: the mass appeal of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the form of popular devotion to celestial bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Tārā,2 and the virtuosi in a small minority who were concerned with a great variety of Vajrayāna texts, doctrines, and meditation practices. Yet this tantric elite exerted a formative influence in the (re)shaping of Newar Buddhist culture, designing the rituals that were done in the Buddhist monasteries, their temples, and homes of their devotees. These Indic <em>vajrācārya</em>s, some monks, others free agent householders, served as gurus, healers, artists.</p>
<p>Texts highlighting Mahāyāna devotional teachings are among the earliest attested in the Valley, such as the <em>Saddharmapuṇḍarīka</em> and the <em>Bodhicaryāvatāra</em>; significantly, each contains chapters concerned with Buddhist <em>pūjā</em> and its rewards. Their concern with ritual signifies their intended applicability to Buddhist communities in late antiquity; it is clear that the sanghas in early Malla Nepal had adopted this inheritance and continued to adapt it to their own sociocultural circumstances. On the popular, exoteric level, they focused on celestial bodhisattvas and the bodhisattva ethos, while its elite had absorbed tantric <em>sādhana</em> traditions, as some in the Newar sangha came to serve the householder community with rituals built on tantric theory as the core cultural system.</p>
<p>As this evolutionary trend unfolded in Nepal, it is also clear that there occurred a literal, “domestication of sangha” by the end of the Malla period (1200‒1769), as the formerly celibate monastic sangha came to consist almost entirely of married householders. Further, being a Newar “monk” was no longer a voluntary association, but came to be defined—for all—by birth into endogamous castes that were known collectively as <em>Bare</em>3 in Newari, but who were divided into groups with the surnames <em>Śākyabhikṣu</em> and <em>Bajrācārya</em>.4 The latter were regarded as higher in status and claimed the exclusive right to perform tantric rituals and initiations for the high caste elite in their community.</p>
<p>It now seems clear that the legal and cultural press of Malla rulers and their brāhmanical courts led both the sangha and the entire Buddhist population to live by caste laws and adopt ritual practices that conformed to the <em>dharmaśāstra</em>s, that is, to Hindu religious and legal duties. By 1500, Buddhist elders and leaders seem to have transformed their traditions of monastic life and householder ritual activity, seeking to sustain the Buddhist elite’s status as leading citizens, while also preserving the monastic land holdings. Just as Newar Buddhists continued to build new <em>stūpa</em>s, monasteries, and images adorned in astonishing detail in wood, precious metals, and stone, so too did they skillfully craft intricate new cultural performances, drawing on Vajrayāna doctrines, techniques, and practices. Thus, the <em>bajrācāryas</em> skillfully applied the immense wealth of later Indic Buddhist texts, rituals, and spiritual practices to their new sociopolitical circumstances. <em>Homa</em> rituals, among the most ancient brāhmanical rituals known from the early Vedic period, had been already recast in Mahāyāna Buddhist form by the late Gupta era and are doubtless a case study in the history of Buddhists creatively and wisely adapting to Hindu cultural hegemony. Their extensive development in the Newar Buddhist community in the context of early modern Hindu Nepal is doubtless due to the clear <em>outward</em> commonality with brāhmanical traditions.</p>
<p>While the Newar sangha in the later Malla era continued to have specialists whose focus was manuscript copying, it is evident that the performance of Vajrayāna rituals was also of special interest to some who called themselves Bajrācāryas. Ritual priests in early Malla Nepal had the texts needed to devote themselves to adapting Mahāyāna-Vajrayāna religious understandings and ritual technology to every human context: to build temples, hold festivals, and serve the needs of Buddhist families. This pattern of development in ritual innovation may explain, in part, why Newar tradition lacks a strong scholastic dimension. What is carefully elaborated is the ritualism that expresses and interjects the Mahāyāna-Vajrayāna worldview into every conceivable juncture: for relating successfully to deities, celebrating festivals, marking key moments in the individual’s life. Lacking a tradition of formal philosophical inquiry by a scholarly elite, the center of Newar Buddhism lies in its pervasive orchestration of Vajrayāna teachings and the rituals that channel blessings, well-being, and—for those householders willing to practice—movement toward enlightenment.</p>
<h3 id="textual-sources-for-newar-homa-rituals"><em>Textual Sources for Newar</em> Homa <em>Rituals</em></h3>
<p>Contributors to and inheritors of later north Indic Buddhism, Newar tradition accordingly preserves many aspects of this now-defunct religious world. A broad range of tantric texts are prominent in both the archives and current traditions in the Valley. Since most Buddhist tantras include sections devoted to the <em>homa</em> practice, it is not surprising that these are cited or relevant to tracing the history of this rite in Nepal.5 Authoritative texts for <em>homa</em> in the Newar tradition are the <em>Mañjuśrīmūlakalpa, Guhyasamāja Tantra, Cakrasamvara Tantra, the Vasanta-tilaka, the Hevajra Tantra, the Kriśṇayamāri Tantra, the Samvarodaya Tantra, Kālacakra Tantra</em>, and the <em>Kriyāsaṃgraha by Kuladatta</em>.6</p>
<h3 id="the-ritualists-members-of-the-bajrācārya-sangha">The Ritualists: Members of the Bajr<em>ā</em>c<em>ā</em>rya Sangha</h3>
<p>The Newar sangha today is divided consists of two parts, Śākya and Bajrācārya. Males born into all of these families become Śākya and members of the Śākya sangha by obtaining the Buddhist ordination called <em>pravajya</em>. Additionally, those born into the Bajrācārya families become members of the Bajrācārya Sangha by obtaining the <em>acārya-abhiṣeka</em> after the <em>pravajya</em>. Thus, male children of a Bajrācārya family obtain the same first ordination as those who will remain Śākya, but then they alone do the second, the <em>acārya-abhiṣeka</em> in their father’s home monastery. After obtaining the <em>acārya-abhiṣeka</em> the new <em>bajrācāryas</em> are trained in performing the most common ritual, the Buddhist <em>homa</em> and from that time afterward they are empowered to perform it for patrons.7 Only a Bajrācārya man can perform the <em>homa</em> ritual in the Newar Buddhist community, either alone or in concert with three, five, or more <em>bajrācārya</em>s. Thus, the <em>bajrācārya</em> sangha is defined as a group by the <em>homa</em>. Every new full member is taught to perform this key ritual at initiation, and each <em>Bajrācārya</em> boy must do the regular <em>Sahasra āhuti</em> [<em>homa</em>] rite himself in his own Bāhā (monastery) and then the <em>māmsāhuti homa</em> at a temple site associated with one of the eight mother goddesses (<em>aṣṭamātṛkā pitha)</em>.</p>
<p>It will also be evident in this chapter that this ritual is woven into the fabric of Newar Buddhist life. We now turn to the characteristic forms this ritual takes today in the Kathmandu Valley and when and why <em>homa</em> is performed in Newar Buddhist settings.</p>
<h2 id="overview-of-newar-tradition-names-and-types-of-homa">OVERVIEW OF NEWAR TRADITION: NAMES AND TYPES OF <em>HOMA</em></h2>
<p>This outline of all major actions in the Newar Buddhist <em>homa</em> is based on the printed ritual guidebook entitled <em>Kalaśārcananādi Homa Vidhāna-Pustakam</em> that was edited by the Lt. Pandit Amoghavajra Bajrācārya,8 the greatest scholar-ritualist of mid-twentieth-century Nepal. This special master lineage holder in the Kathmandu sangha cites his primary source as a hand-copied manuscript9 that was dated 1530 C.E.</p>
<p>In conveying the parameters of this ritual tradition in Nepal, the diversity of forms, detail, complexity, and options is striking. The patron has many choices to make in these facets: but some performances of <em>homa</em> are “compulsory” parts of life-cycle rituals and other occasions according to modern conventions; on the other hand, other esoteric <em>homa</em> rituals can be done only by or for those who have tantric initiations.</p>
<p>A review of these various possible options is instructive to grasp the flexibility and depth of Newar Buddhist <em>homa</em> ritualism: the <em>homa</em> performed can be classed by the <em>number of oblations</em> (<em>āhuti</em>) to Agni made, ranging from the minimum of one thousand (<em>sahasra</em>, the most common by far), to those rare but more ambitious ceremonies that employ more than one <em>bajrācārya</em> priest and may entail from 10,000 (<em>ayuta-āhuti</em>) or even 100,000 (<em>lakṣa-āhuti</em>). Newar Buddhist <em>homa</em>s are defined by the central objects to be burnt; most are based on one thousand or more oblations of ghee (<em>caru-āhuti, gṛhta-āhuti</em>), but there are also those of an esoteric nature for which other items are central: the <em>māmsa-āhuti</em> (108 x meat), <em>śira-āhuti</em> (1 x head), or the <em>nara-āhuti</em> (1 x human offering). (These will be discussed below.) And then the <em>bajrācārya</em> priest can offer to do a <em>homa</em> that varies by elaborateness/length of time: either a general form, or a “long form” <em>homa</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>pit</em> (<em>kuṇḍa</em>) can also be modest or large, with a minimum of five unbaked bricks, the one arranged with thirty-two bricks, or the “half-deep fire pit” (<em>ardha-khāla yajñaśālā</em>) in the 100,000 oblation rite. (In practice, construction can utilize more or less than thirty-two bricks.) When by a river, the rite can be done simply on sand, with only the symbol of the <em>agni-kuṇḍa</em> and the eight directional deities (see below) drawn in it. The <em>homa kuṇḍa</em> is popularly known as <em>yajñaśālā</em> however it is built. In Newar usage, there is also the category of the “half deep <em>homa kuṇḍa</em>” (<em>ardha khāla yajñaśālā</em>): it is bigger and higher than the typical one and resembles a square-shaped well. To make this kind of <em>homa kuṇḍa</em> requires a special <em>pādasthāpana pūjā</em> (“foundation ritual”) that must be done beforehand. The same establishment rite must be done for any stone or metal square <em>homa kuṇḍa</em> that is fixed permanently, as can be found in many Newar monasteries and temples for the convenience of the community.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a Newar tradition that certain highly accomplished <em>bajrācārya</em> masters can do a <em>homa</em> just by marking the ground with <em>homa</em> symbol (<em>Agni Chinha</em>, the symbol of fire) and then do the <em>homa</em> ritual.</p>
<p>All types of Buddhist <em>homa kuṇḍa</em> will be made with bricks set in the pattern of the “<em>svastika</em> shape.” A vajra is drawn in the center, and symbols of the eight directional deities are drawn accordingly around the <em>homa kuṇḍa</em>. In the case of the <em>ardha khāla homa site’s kuṇḍa,</em> the icons of the deities are drawn. And in every <em>homa kuṇḍa</em> there will be a different “mouth” (Skt. <em>ostha</em>) of Agni that is understood to be extended in each direction. All <em>homa kuṇḍa</em>s are demolished a few days after the ritual; Newar Buddhists regard the bricks used in <em>homa</em>s to be auspicious for the construction of permanent buildings. In the case of the performance of the <em>lakṣa āhuti</em> and <em>ahorātra homa</em>s, there must also be a <em>nāga pūjā</em> ritual done before disposing of the remaining ashes (<em>bhasmapravāha pūjā</em>) in a river.</p>
<h2 id="when-newar-buddhists-perform-homa">WHEN NEWAR BUDDHISTS PERFORM <em>HOMA</em></h2>
<p>Since <em>homa</em> rituals are central to the lives of Newar Buddhists, the tradition as interpreted by the modern <em>bajrācārya</em> priests has identified moments in the individual life cycle, or occasions of religious donation, when they must be performed; there are also times when they are recommended, but not compulsory. The following norms and expectations do show some variation due to the individual family’s caste and the patron’s gender. The contexts of the various Newar <em>homas</em> can be cited here, without extensive commentary.</p>
<h3 id="occasion-when-required-by-tradition">Occasion When Required by Tradition</h3>
<p><em>Death and Mourning</em> are major times when all Buddhists perform rituals to make merit for the deceased and insure that the dead go to auspicious destinies. Among most householders, <em>homa</em> is performed at the end of the initial, intense mourning and impurity period, on the twelfth day afterwards as part of the <em>Gha:su</em> (Skt. <em>gṛha-śuddha, hasta-śuddha</em>) rituals.10 Among the Śākyas and Bajrācāryas, this ritual is done on the seventh day after the death; and on this day, the <em>homa</em> rites are done in two places: inside the house where the person died; and in the monastery (Ne. <em>bāhā)</em> where the household’s patrilineage has membership. <em>Gṛha śuddha</em> is believed to be effective for purifying the house and satisfying the needs of the deceased who now exists in the <em>antarābhava</em>, or intermediate state, between death and new rebirth. Newar tradition holds that all beings exist as a <em>preta</em> (a being in the intermediate state between lives) for at least seven days.</p>
<p>Newar Buddhist mourning also entails a year of special <em>śrāddha</em> rituals done for the purpose of making merit for the dead. During each of twelve subsequent lunar months, on the monthly anniversary of the death, the family gathers for these rites done by the chief mourner and their <em>bajrācārya</em> priest. On the last of these months, that is, on the one-year death anniversary, a <em>homa</em> ritual is added to mark this moment.</p>
<p>Since it is regarded as the most distinguished Buddhist ritual, <em>homa</em> is often performed to mark the end of other cycles of ritual performances. This is the case for a one year of monthly Buddhist <em>vrata</em>s, monthly <em>śraddha</em>s at <em>tirtha</em>s mourning a dead person, at the end of the periodically held tantric initiations (<em>dikṣā</em>) into the practice of Cakrasamvara or Vajradevī,11 which are open to only the highest Buddhist castes (Urāy, Śākya, Bajrācārya); or upon the completion of a period of tantric meditative retreat (<em>Puraścaraṇa Cvanegu</em>), which is also only done by this elite.</p>
<p><em>Homa</em> is also done at every step in the sequence of rites for the construction activity for the establishment of images, <em>caityas</em>, pilgrims’ resthouses, and monasteries. After their formal consecration, a <em>homa</em> ritual should be performed to mark the yearly anniversary of these same structures, a ceremony Newars refer to as <em>Busādan</em> (Skt. <em>varśabandhana</em>).</p>
<p><em>Homa</em> must also be done as part of Newar Buddhist life-cycle rites. For example, <em>homa</em> is performed for members of the Jyāpu farmer class at the completion of the coming of age rite called <em>olā chonegu</em>. Similarly, it is done by the head priest who officiates at the initiation of a new cohort of <em>bajrācārya</em> novices in the rite of passage called <em>bare chuiyegu</em>. For families that perform any of the three late life celebration ritual called <em>Burā/buri Janko, homa</em> is a central ritual of the second day.</p>
<p>There are a number of Newar festivals that are the object of community or <em>guthi</em> celebrations, whose perpetual endowments underwrite specific rituals. Examples are the annual <em>homa</em> ritual in the Bhadrakālī temple done by <em>bajrācāryas</em> of Sabal Bāhā during the spring Pañcahre festival; and <em>māmsa āhuti homas</em> done by <em>bajrācāryas</em> of Jhvā Bāhā at the Indrayani temple at Phushingh kyaḥ on the full moon day of Lhuti. There are many other such customs at the temples of the eight mother goddess (<em>aṣṭamātṛkā)</em> throughout the Kathmandu Valley.</p>
<h3 id="optional-homa-ritual-occasions"><em>Optional</em> Homa <em>Ritual Occasions</em></h3>
<p>The Newar Buddhist tradition regards the <em>homa</em> ritual as the highest form of ritual celebration, entailing the most effort and attracting the most prestige for the patrons. So although not required by tradition, individual families may opt for the family priest to add it to a variety of ritual celebrations. This includes the early <em>daśa karma</em> or life passage rites done by Buddhist householders such as the <em>cūḍā karma, vratabandhana</em>, and <em>vratamokṣana</em>.12 For <em>pāṇi grahaṇa</em> or wedding rites among high caste Newar Buddhists, <em>homa</em> is a sign of prestige; for Jyāpu farmers, the most distinguished way of offering <em>piṇḍa</em>s to the ancestors is the <em>bhim-ka pyon thāyegu</em> mourning rite and this requires <em>homa</em>. For high caste Newar Buddhists who want to do the special <em>kriyā piṇḍa</em> rite, <em>homa</em> must be done.</p>
<p>Family and household rituals can be upgraded by including <em>homa</em>. This includes the <em>bau biyegu</em> or house protection ritual. The popular <em>sattva pūjā</em>13 is done at major shrines and when special needs arise, a <em>homa</em> ritual can be added to it; if so either the <em>sahasra</em> (1,000) or <em>ayuta</em> (10,000) version should be done. A fire ritual to appease or remove obstacles from planetary deities is another Newar variant. A ritual based on the <em>homa</em> procedures, but centered on water offerings <em>(jala-yajña)</em> not fire offerings (<em>yajña</em>), also exists to invoke the nine nāgas when there is a need to produce rain.14</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unusual <em>homa</em> ritual in the Newar tradition is that done twelve days after a dead cat or snake is found in one’s house. For this, the offering place is circular and the <em>homa kuṇḍa</em> is made of five bricks arranged in a circle, not the usual square.</p>
<h2 id="description-of-a-standard-newar-buddhist-homa-ritual">DESCRIPTION OF A STANDARD NEWAR BUDDHIST <em>HOMA</em> RITUAL</h2>
<p><em>Preliminaries.<em>15 The <em>homa</em> performance usually begins in the early morning; the <em>bajrācārya</em> priest(s) must fast until the completion of the ritual and there must be a patron family (<em>jajamāna</em>) who appoints members to attend to the <em>bajrācārya</em> and ritual set-up as bearer of offerings. The priest arrives with his usual ritual implements (<em>vajra, vajra-ghantha</em> [bell with vajra handle], <em>vajra, makuta</em> [crown of Five Buddhas]); he also carries the special <em>homa</em> implements (<em>sulāpā</em> [special ladle with square shape], <em>catvā</em> [pointed ritual spatula], <em>dhova</em> [spoon ladle], y</em>amkhā si</em> [tripod with ghee vessel with a hole for <em>kuśa</em>-grass].</p>
<p>The patron family is also expected to provide the essentials for offerings:</p>
<p><em>kalaśa</em> [water vessel], ghee (clarified butter), <em>kuśa</em> grass, <em>druva</em> grass, a bunch/bundle of pieces of <em>sosim</em> wood, 32 pieces of <em>simtā</em> wood, <em>Homapi</em> bundle,16 pure water,17 flowers, incense, lamp, chalk, <em>sinha</em> fragrance,18 husked rice, puffed rice, taste items (food, fruits, cow milk, liquor), ball of five-strand thread, <em>pañcagavya</em>,19 yogurt, “<em>baniyā</em> items,”20 32 kinds of grains21 (Skt. <em>vṛhi</em>).</p>
<p>Most <em>bajrācāryas</em> have a printed list of these items, although many householders know them by heart.</p>
<p>The work begins with ritual set-up of the <em>homa kuṇḍa</em>, then a series of required preliminary rituals that set the stage for <em>homa</em> at the beginning, then close off the ritual—several hours later—to end the entire ceremony when completed. To denote the course of the <em>homa</em> ritual conveniently, the following abbreviations will be used for the various “praxis units” according to which this and other Newar ritual traditions are assembled. The preliminary rituals are seven in number, including the *gurumaṇḍala pūjā.*22 After the <em>homa</em> ritual commences and ends with the last or <em>sesa āhuti</em> oblation, the <em>bajrācārya</em> will do the closing of all the preliminary rites and <em>homa</em> ritual, which is called <em>visarjana</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-esoteric-newar-buddhist-homa">THE ESOTERIC NEWAR BUDDHIST <em>HOMA</em></h2>
<p>From the Newar Buddhist point of view, all types of <em>homa</em> performed by <em>bajrācārya</em>s are “tantric,” since they require their practices associated with <em>sādhana</em>. This includes the most common <em>homa</em> performed in the Newar Buddhist community, which is the exoteric grain and ghee offering to Agni called <em>charu āhuti homa</em>. This <em>homa</em> takes place in the day time, everybody can participate in it as patron or observer, and worldly benefits can be expected from taking part. For this reason, the texts refer to this form as <em>laukika</em> or “worldly” <em>homa</em>.</p>
<p>Just as this community has an esoteric realm of practice that is open only to the highest caste Buddhist communities, there are <em>homa</em> rituals that can only be done by, and even only be seen by, those individuals with tantric initiation. (This is a small minority even among these high caste groups.) These esoteric rites are called the <em>Māmsa āhuti</em> (“meat oblation”), <em>Śira āhuti</em> (“head oblation”), <em>Nara āhuti</em> (“human oblation”) <em>homa</em>s, as well as in the <em>lokottara homa</em> that can be added to the <em>ahorātra homa.</em> Each can be discussed further here.</p>
<h3 id="ahorātra-homa-lit-day-and-night-homa"><em>Ahorātra</em> homa <em>(lit. “day and night</em> homa*”)*</h3>
<p>Performed in the home, it can be done for a whole day and whole night. In the daytime is the <em>laukika</em> (exoteric) form; only at night is the <em>lokottara</em> (esoteric) <em>homa</em> done. It must be performed in the course of the establishment or restoration rituals at Svayambhū or other major stūpas as well as at prominent <em>yoginī</em> temples located in the Valley, especially those in the towns of Pharping, Sānkhu, Guhyeśvarī, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="māmsa-āhuti-and-śira-āhuti-homa"><em>Māmsa Āhuti and Śira Āhuti</em> Homa</h3>
<p>This offering of <em>māmsa Āhuti</em> must be performed at tantric <em>pitha</em>s, shrines that are usually situated at cremation sites along river banks or on hilltops.29 As noted, this is the rite that must also be done by a young <em>bajrācārya</em> immediately after he assumes his full status through initiation.</p>
<p>This esoteric <em>homa</em> is also an integral part of the other tantric initiations in Newar Buddhist tradition. The <em>māmsa āhuti homa</em> is performed during the course of the Cakrasamvara initiation and the <em>Śira āhuti homa</em> is performed during the course of the Vajravarāhī initiation as the rite of <em>purnā</em> or completion of the initiation. In the performance of the secret <em>Māmsa āhuti</em> and <em>Śira āhuti, bajrācārya</em>s limit access to initiates. They sing <em>cāryagīti</em>s30 at every main step in the ritual and these doubtless contain hints of the history of these practices in the earlier tantric tradition. Examples of the ritual use of these songs include when during the <em>Māmsa āhuti</em> the central figure of Samaya Agni is visualized, the priest sings a unique <em>cārya gīti</em> entitled “Triniloyana” by the Siddha Karṇapā; when in the course of the tantric <em>Sahasra āhuti</em> there are oblations given to Jñāna Agni, the <em>bajrācārya</em> sings a <em>cārya gīti</em> entitled “Jvalitavajrānala” and when <em>Māmsa āhuti</em> is offered to the Jñāna Agni, the <em>bajrācārya</em> sings the <em>cārya gīti</em> entitled “Kolayi” from the <em>Hevajra Tantra</em>.</p>
<p>Both of these <em>homa</em> rituals must also be observed on the occasion of the establishment of a new or restored <em>āgam dyaḥ</em> (Skt. <em>āgama devata</em>), the tantric shrines located in the upper storey of Newar monasteries and found in the homes of Śākyas, Bajrācāryas, and Urāy.</p>
<p>The objective of <em>Māmsa āhuti homa</em> is to have the priest and initiates participate in the visualization of their five <em>skandhas</em> (physical body, sensations, perceptions, habit energies, consciousness) being ignited and burned completely away into a state of emptiness (<em>śūnya</em>). It is the same principle underlying a tantric yogin burning the five <em>skandha</em>s through “<em>caṇḍali yoga,</em>” a practice of <em>anuttara yogatantra</em>. Just as the Buddha said in the first noble truth that <em>pañca-upadāna-skandham eva dukkham</em> (“the five attached components of a human lead to suffering”), this practice as understood by Newar tradition seeks to end the fundamental components of a human being retaining their hold over us; it likewise accepts that since, as in the “Fire Sermon,” all our senses “burn” into our awareness as if they are on fire, so does their esoteric <em>homa</em> ritual skillfully use this same fire as the basis of a spiritual practice to destroy, or burn off, attachment to the body.</p>
<p>The objective of the <em>Śira āhuti homa</em> likewise connects with the larger practices of Vajrayāna Buddhism. Just as in the <em>Mahābali arcana</em> yoga practice, the initiated yogin visualizes sacrificing his own sense organs as an offering to various deities, so in the <em>Mahābali arcana kriyā</em> practice the yogin visualizes sacrificing his or her own sense organs as an offering for various deities, as these are invoked into the fire of Agni. Because the five sense organs play a vital role for accumulating defilements, the tantric <em>homa</em> provides a time when initiates can exercise their practice promoting detachment. Similarly, offering one’s five sense organs to other beings promotes the perfection of generosity for those on the bodhisattva path.</p>
<h3 id="nara-āhuti-homa"><em>Nara Āhuti</em> Homa</h3>
<p>This <em>homa</em> is an essential part of the rites designed to affect an initiate’s own death process. Soon after the death of a Bajrācārya, Śākya, or Urāy who has taken tantric initiation(s) and who has requested them, a <em>bajrācārya</em> priest performs tantric <em>utkrānti</em> rituals31 and yoga proximate to the dead body. At the end of these tantric rites, a <em>sahasra āhuti homa</em> is performed using a large, round clay bowl. This whole ritual takes place around midnight. It is the completion ritual for the <em>utkrānti</em> yoga.</p>
<p>On the next morning this same round clay bowl (<em>agnikuṇḍa</em>) is taken with the funeral procession after the dead one’s body has been placed on a bier and the body arranged in the seated position. At the cremation ghat, the corpse still in the seated position will be put over the pyre and another <em>homa</em> will be conducted. In the course of this final <em>homa</em>, the <em>bajrācārya</em> ritualist will instruct the chief mourner to put the first stick of firewood on the lap of the dead one32 using the flame taken from the round clay bowl that served as the <em>agnikuṇḍa</em>. Here it is assumed that the dead human’s body is being offered to Agni.</p>
<p>As <em>lokottara homa</em> is a higher and rare practice, initiates are taught not to make wishes for worldly benefits for taking part in this rite. The spiritual center is to use the outward gestures of <em>homa</em> to transcend habitual mundane conceptual patterns; by visualizing the burning up all of one’s own flesh, head, and sense organs, the practitioner can burn out all of one’s own defilements and attachments to mundane knowledge. To use this practice is to seek freedom from the defilements and to develop the supramundane knowledge that leads to the realization of Buddhahood. In this sense, Newar Buddhist teachers see <em>homa</em> as an important application of the ideal of <em>upāya kauśala,</em> a practice classified under <em>kriyā tantra</em> in the standard division of Vajrayāna traditions.</p>
<h2 id="homa-and-the-establishment-of-buddhist-monasteries-and-sacred-objects"><em>HOMA</em> AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BUDDHIST MONASTERIES AND SACRED OBJECTS</h2>
<p>In the course of different stages in vihara construction, there must be Pratisthā ritual; for these, the “Daśa Agni” (ten types of fire) are visualized, one by one, then each receives a Ghṛta Āhuti (offering ghee) in the order shown in table 1.</p>
<p>Ten types of Homa Fire i. Krodha agnivi. Lohita agni ii. Pāvaka agnivii. Pramoha agni iii. Maruta agniviii. Tāpasa agni iv. Kāma agniix. Amrta agni v. Mahendra agnix. Yojaka agni</p>
<p>In an Ayuta Āhuti (10,000) <em>homa</em> ritual, each Ghṛta Āhuti is offered after each thousand Caru Āhuti offerings. Thus, Ghṛta Āhuti is offered ten times in an Ayuta Āhuti <em>homa</em> ritual.</p>
<p>As part of the rituals consecrating images, <em>caitya</em>s, other sacred objects, these objects must receive <em>daśa karma rites</em>, as if they are human in both male and female forms. From the Jāta karma stage to Pāṇigrahaṇa karma stage, <em>āhuti</em> is given to the Agni after the name of seven different agni following each karma stage.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
<p><em>Newar Hindu and Buddhist Homa Traditions.</em> The co-existence of Buddhist and Hindu traditions was described in the earliest accounts of the Kathmandu Valley by Chinese pilgrims. Although these are vague beyond noting that temples to the great Hindu gods existed alongside Buddhist monasteries, it is certain that this small mid-montane Himalayan settlement was a periphery frontier of all Indic traditions, from Sanskrit texts to sacred art, from architecture to ritual practices. Just as the Indic arrivals changed over time to add to the cumulative culture, so did the shaping of innovative cultural forms from priests, monks, scholars, and pilgrims also become altered in the hands of the local Newar virtuosi. That a Hindu-Brahman cultural formation in Nepal has for many centuries co-existed with a Buddhist-sangha/virtuoso formation suggests that there were commonalities due to their mutual Indic origins, as well as reasons for their remaining distinct in local traditions of interpretation and praxis. <em>Homa</em> traditions are one case study in this complex religious field.</p>
<p>It is clear that Nepal preserves forms of brahmanical <em>homa</em> practice that may have nearly disappeared elsewhere in South Asia.33 Although no in-depth study has been done to survey Newar Hindu rituals, what can be stated is that today the <em>homa</em> rituals are done by Newar Deo Brahmins who serve as the purohitas for Newar Hindus. These brahmans have no corresponding concept of the Newar Buddhist philosophical underpinnings such as Bhuta Agni, Jñāna Agni, Samya Agni, and so on. In the modern Newar Hindu <em>homa</em>, Agni is just a vehicle for the similar set of offerings made to the fire. As we have seen, the <em>bajrācārya</em> ritualist specifically invokes this deity from water into the fire; and his visualizing an entire <em>ma</em>ṇḍ<em>ala</em> into the fire itself is central to the Newar Buddhist practice today.</p>
<p>One other point of interest is the renown that the Buddhist <em>homa</em> practice has commanded outside the usual boundaries that separate Hindu householders (Shresthas) from their Buddhist neighbors. As mentioned above, <em>bajrācārya</em>s perform a special <em>gṛha śuddha-hastaśuddha homa</em> on the seventh or twelfth day after the death of a family member.34 It has been true that for at least a century and likely longer that Hindu Newars call a <em>bajrācārya</em> to do this ritual that includes <em>homa</em>; it is thought to insure that the home is fully purified and that all living there are protected from any harm. Newar Deo Brāhmins do other <em>homa</em>s, but not this one any more. Since Newar Hindu families want it, but neither of the Newar Hindu ritualists—Deo Brāahmans or Karmācāryas—do it, many Hindu families that can afford the expense call <em>bajrācārya</em>s after a death in the immediate family.</p>
<p>The procedures of early <em>homa</em> ritual (creating primal fire; offerings of grain and ghee into fire) may have been the root aspect of <em>homa</em> discipline. That the procedures of <em>homa</em> ritual differ from each other in later Hinduism and Buddhism reflects divergent developments in their philosophies as well as the needs of their respective householder communities. After three thousand years, this cultural divergence led to the identification of the source of their <em>homa</em> to be either a god or the tantric Buddhist masters, respectively. Today, both traditions regard <em>homa</em> performance as one of the vital instruments for achieving both worldly blessings for humanity as well as supramundane benefits for individual human beings.</p>
<h3 id="regarding-tantric-buddhism-and-homa-bāhya-homa"><em>Regarding Tantric Buddhism and</em> Homa (B<em>ā</em>hya-homa)</h3>
<p>Having presented the <em>homa</em> with attention to all its detail, and after noting the time and expense involved in the performance of this Newar ritual tradition, it is instructive to ask: Why did <em>homa</em> become part of the Indic Mahāyāna-Vajrayāna tradition that was exported to China, Japan, and Tibet? Here we provide the explanations prevalent from the history of the Newar Buddhist community.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>upāya-kauśala</em> (“skillful means”) is seen as underlying the integration of the Indic <em>homa</em> ritual technology into Buddhism in the same way that yoga discipline, mantra discipline, <em>jyotish</em> discipline, <em>ayurveda</em> cultural forms were similarly adapted. The cause of doing what alleviates suffering and is useful for the welfare of all beings (Skt. <em>Sarva-prakāranam jakatohitāya</em>) is incumbent on those wishing to be bodhisattvas. To this foundation can be added a pillar of tantric philosophy: since what is bound by the <em>pañca-skandha</em> (five constituents of a human being) and material elements lead to beings’ suffering, these same things, Agni—fire—can be used to foster release also.</p>
