Tsunehiko Sugiki
INTRODUCTION Brahmanism developed various forms of external fire oblation rituals from the beginning of its history.1 Meanwhile, some traditions in Brahmanism (especially the Upaniṣadic tradition) attempted to internalize fire oblation rituals and developed various theories on the internal practice of fire oblation.2
The same attempt can be seen in Buddhist esoteric traditions. The Mahāvairocana-sūtra (ca. seventh century) is the oldest Buddhist scripture that systematically teaches inner forms of fire oblation. Several esoteric scriptures (i.e., tantras) compiled after the Mahāvairocana-sūtra expound a variety of different kinds of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation. For example, in his Jyotirmañjarī, Abhayākaragupta (eleventh to twelfth centuries) presents a typology of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation: (1) mental fire oblation (yid kyi sbyin sreg), (2) internal fire oblation (nang gi sbyin sreg, adhyātmahoma), and (3) supreme fire oblation (bla na med pa’i sbyin sreg). He further divides internal fire oblation into: (2)-1 internal fire oblation by use of external matters (phyi rol gyi rdzas kyis nang gi sbyin sreg, bāhyavastunādhyātmahoma), and (2)-2 internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matter (phyi rol gyi rdzas la ma ltos pa’i nang gi sbyin sreg).3 This typology is not perfect. There are other Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation that do not fall into either category, or that are mixtures of these types. (However, this typology is useful to a certain extent if we take it as a list of elements of practice that constitute actual types of inner fire oblation rather than as a list of actual types of inner fire oblation.)">

<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Brahmanism developed various forms of external fire oblation rituals from the beginning of its history.1 Meanwhile, some traditions in Brahmanism (especially the Upaniṣadic tradition) attempted to internalize fire oblation rituals and developed various theories on the internal practice of fire oblation.2</p>
<p>The same attempt can be seen in Buddhist esoteric traditions. The <em>Mahāvairocana-sūtra</em> (ca. seventh century) is the oldest Buddhist scripture that systematically teaches inner forms of fire oblation. Several esoteric scriptures (i.e., tantras) compiled after the <em>Mahāvairocana-sūtra</em> expound a variety of different kinds of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation. For example, in his <em>Jyotirmañjarī</em>, Abhayākaragupta (eleventh to twelfth centuries) presents a typology of Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation: (1) mental fire oblation (<em>yid kyi sbyin sreg</em>), (2) internal fire oblation (<em>nang gi sbyin sreg, adhyātmahoma</em>), and (3) supreme fire oblation (<em>bla na med pa’i sbyin sreg</em>). He further divides internal fire oblation into: (2)-1 internal fire oblation by use of external matters (<em>phyi rol gyi rdzas kyis nang gi sbyin sreg, bāhyavastunādhyātmahoma</em>), and (2)-2 internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matter (<em>phyi rol gyi rdzas la ma ltos pa’i nang gi sbyin sreg</em>).3 This typology is not perfect. There are other Buddhist systems of inner fire oblation that do not fall into either category, or that are mixtures of these types. (However, this typology is useful to a certain extent if we take it as a list of elements of practice that constitute actual types of inner fire oblation rather than as a list of actual types of inner fire oblation.)</p>
<p>This essay analyzes structures of Buddhist systems of “psychosomatic fire oblation” developed between ninth and thirteenth centuries in South Asia, and through this analysis draws a comprehensive picture of them. Systems of psychosomatic fire oblation can also be found in Śaivism and Vaiṣṇavism,4 and constitute an important component throughout South Asian traditions of fire oblation.</p>
<p>“Psychosomatic fire-oblation” is not a native term. Many of the Buddhist scriptures that teach this type of fire oblation call it “internal fire oblation” (<em>adhyātmahoma, nang gi sbyin sreg</em>, or the like). However, there are other scriptures that do not use the term “internal fire oblation.” Moreover, there are many works that use the term “internal fire oblation” to indicate other types of fire oblation. Hence, I have coined the term “psychosomatic fire oblation” in order to avoid confusion. By “psychosomatic” I mean “of subtle-body yoga,” or “of a circle of channels.” Psychosomatic fire oblation, that is, yogic fire oblation based on the subtle body, roughly corresponds to Abhayākaragupta’s category of internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters, and it also contains elements of meditation that constitute Abhayāyakaragupta’s third category, supreme fire oblation, as well as elements that are not considered in his typology.5</p>
<p>Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation in South Asia have not been fully studied. Yael Bentor conducted a relatively comprehensive study of forms of inner fire oblation (including psychosomatic fire oblation) in India and in Tibet. While this study is no doubt a great contribution and was really helpful for me to research forms of inner fire oblation, there are some problems, especially in her analysis of Buddhist versions of inner fire oblation in South Asia. Some important materials are omitted and her interpretations appear to depend more on the views of the Indian scholar-monk Abhayākaragupta (which were summarized in the second paragraph of this introduction) and some Tibetan scholar-monks (who were probably affected by Abhayākaragupta’s views) than on the texts of Buddhist tantras and related works composed in South Asia.6 Bentor is correct in describing some later scholarly views, but I would like to attach the same importance to the tantra texts and related works in South Asia.</p>
<h2 id="three-elements-that-comprise-structures-of-psychosomatic-fire-oblation-systems">THREE ELEMENTS THAT COMPRISE STRUCTURES OF PSYCHOSOMATIC FIRE OBLATION SYSTEMS</h2>
<p>Three elements form the structure of psychosomatic fire oblation practices in esoteric Buddhism: the practice of oblation, nonconceptual meditation, and subtle-body yoga. We will consider these elements before examining the instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation given in Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<h3 id="oblation-practice-internalization-of-a-standard-ritual-form-of-fire-oblation">Oblation Practice: Internalization of a Standard Ritual Form of Fire Oblation</h3>
<p>A standard ritual form of fire oblation, often called “external fire oblation” (<em>bāhyahoma</em>), is divided into four kinds (or more) according to its function: the pacifying (<em>śānti</em>) rite, the prospering (<em>puṣṭi</em>) rite, the bewitching (<em>vaśya</em> or the like) rite, and the subjugating (<em>abhicāra</em> or the like) rite. Psychosomatic fire oblation does not have these ritual categories. Nevertheless, the standard ritual form of fire oblation served as a model for the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. A practitioner uses external ritual items such as a hearth (<em>kuṇḍa</em>), a fire (<em>agni</em> or the like), and big and small ritual ladles (<em>pātrī</em> and <em>sruva</em>, etc.), firewood (<em>samidh</em> or <em>samidha</em>), fuel (<em>indhana</em>), and various offered articles in the standard ritual form of fire oblation. In psychosomatic fire oblation all of these items are internalized, that is, equated with components of the practitioner’s body and mind.</p>
<p>The idea that fire oblation is performed to gratify deities is also incorporated into the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation, with a modification from the yogic viewpoint. The <em>Subāhuparipṛcchā</em> (ca. sixth century) offers a concise explanation of this basic mechanism: “Deities become satisfied through the fire oblation. They bring fruits as hoped.”7 As described in the <em>Subāhuparipṛcchā</em>, the mechanism of gift-giving is premised upon a widely accepted idea underlying many ritual systems, that practitioners and deities are distinguished from each other in terms of their ritual roles. To some degree preserving this ritual idea, the idea that the practitioner and the deities are ultimately undivided is emphasized in the system of psychosomatic fire oblation. From this viewpoint, oblations to deities are simultaneously oblations to the practitioner.</p>

<p>Just as a fire burns fuel (wood) into ashes, so gnosis (<em>jñāna</em>) destroys sins, defilements, and all worldly concerns. In this analogy, fire has often been regarded as a symbol of gnosis in both Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions since the ancient age.8 Conversely, some ancient Brahmanical (Upaniṣadic) scriptures put forward the idea that knowledge of ultimate reality formed the essential part of fire oblation rituals in general. The earliest case of this is found in the <em>Chāndogyopaniṣad</em>, according to which knowledge of the universal Self (<em>vaiśvānarātman</em>) makes an oblation universal and that burns up all bad things in the practitioners of the rite.9</p>
<p>The idea that knowledge of ultimate reality constitutes the heart of fire oblation practice became prevalent and was combined with the idea of the fire metaphor of gnosis. The Buddhist <em>Mahāvairocana-sūtra</em> teaches a contemplation of nonconceptual reality as a superior form of fire oblation practice, calling it “the internal fire oblation” (<em>nang gi sbyin sreg</em>). In this practice, gnosis is called “nonconceptualizing wisdom” (’<em>phro ba med pa’i shes rab</em>) or “mental fire” (<em>yid kyi me</em>). Fire in this practice does not mean an actual material fire but refers to one’s mind in a meditative state. Through this contemplative fire oblation, concepts produced from and dependent on the mind, such as sensory objects and the process of their perception, are counteracted and disintegrated by the mind in a meditative state.10 A similar teaching appears in many Buddhist scriptures composed after the <em>Mahāvairocana-sūtra</em>,11 in which metaphoric fire is called “the fire of gnosis” (<em>jñānānala, jñānāgni, ye shes me</em>) or the like.</p>
<h3 id="the-subtle-body-or-the-circle-of-channels">**The Subtle Body, or the Circle of Channels</h3>
<p>The Sāṃkhya religio-philosophical tradition in Brahmanism is probably the oldest tradition that uses the term “subtle body” (<em>sūkṣmaśarīra</em>) to indicate the collective body of one’s mental and physical functions (such as speaking, holding, hearing, touching, thinking, etc.). It can be defined as the functional or spiritual body. One’s subtle body works within the gross (physical) body (<em>sthūlaśarīra</em>), and together they constitute an individual being. The subtle body plays a vital role in both the ordinary activities of one’s life and in one’s spiritual training. Tantric traditions (both Buddhist and non-Buddhist) incorporated this idea of the subtle body and developed tantric forms of it.</p>
<p>Much importance was given to the “channels” (also translated as veins or arteries, <em>nāḍī</em>), and theories of the subtle body centered around these channels were developed.12 There are said to be seventy-two thousand channels in one’s body. Channels are bodily pathways through which various substances, such as “winds” (<em>prāṇa</em>, etc.) and other body substances carried by the winds move, or they are the movements of these substances per se. One’s mental and physical activities are closely connected with movements of body substances in (or as) channels. Thus, meditation on channels and the movement of body substances through them is an important practice.</p>
<p>As is well known, the <em>Hevajra-tantra</em> (ca. eighth century) is the first Buddhist scripture to systematically expound the subtle-body system centered on channels. In Buddhism the term “circle of channels” (<em>nāḍīcakra</em>) is more general than the term “subtle body.” There are three principle channels: <em>avadhūtī, lalanā</em>, and <em>rasanā. Avadhūtī</em> is the supreme channel, running along the vertical centerline of one’s body from the head to the abdomen. The <em>lalanā</em> and <em>rasanā</em> run on the left and right sides of the <em>avadhūtī</em>, respectively. These three channels run through lotus-shaped <em>cakra</em>s (wheels or circles), each with a different number of petals. <em>Cakra</em>s are areas in the body where many channels gather together.</p>
<p>There are different theories regarding the <em>cakra</em>s found in Buddhism. Theories closely related to the psychosomatic fire oblation are the four-<em>cakra</em> theory and the six-<em>cakra</em> theory, especially the former. The four <em>cakra</em>s are the “great bliss <em>cakra</em>” (<em>mahāsukhacakra</em>) in the head, the “enjoyment <em>cakra</em>” (<em>saṃbhogacakra</em>) in the throat, the “Dharma <em>cakra</em>” (<em>dharmacakra</em>) in the heart, and the “creation <em>cakra</em>” (<em>nirmāṇacakra</em>) in the navel area. The six <em>cakra</em>s are these four together with the “fire <em>cakra</em>” (<em>vahnicakra</em>) below the creation <em>cakra</em>, and the “wind <em>cakra</em>” (<em>vāyucakra</em>) below the fire *cakra.*13</p>
<p>Winds, body fluids, and other bodily substances move in the <em>cakra</em>s through channels. Particular types of body fluids are called “awakening mind” (<em>bodhicitta</em>), “immortal nectar” (<em>amṛta</em>), “<em>soma</em>” (<em>soma</em> or <em>somapāṇa</em>), “semen” (<em>retas</em>), and so forth. These are fluid essences symbolizing enlightenment, inner alchemical essences, and/or inner sources of superhuman power. When a practitioner performs yoga based on his subtle body or circle of channels, he ignites a yogic subtle fire or inner heat in his body through breath control and concentration. The yogic subtle fire or inner heat is called either Caṇḍālī or the name of the highest goddess in each scriptural tradition. The yogic subtle fire moves through the channels and <em>cakra</em>s and heats them, and they then secrete the body fluids mentioned above, such as “awakening mind,” and so on.</p>
<p>Composers of Buddhist tantras applied this technique of subtle-body yoga to various kinds of practices in different ways and developed varieties of yogic practices based on the subtle body. A well-known (and the oldest) example is the yoga of perfection process (<em>utpanna-</em>/<em>niṣpanna- krama</em>) connected with the fourfold bliss (<em>caturānanda</em>) theory taught in the <em>Hevajra-tantra</em>. Through this yoga a practitioner attains nondual reality in the form of bliss, called “innate bliss” (<em>sahajānanda</em>) or “great pleasure” (<em>mahāsukha</em>).14 Other examples are some versions of the yoga of creation process (<em>utpattikrama</em>), the psychosomatic <em>bali</em> offering, and so forth. Psychosomatic fire oblation is also an example of an application of subtle-body yoga.</p>
<h3 id="sexual-intercourse-and-its-internalization">Sexual Intercourse and Its Internalization</h3>
<p>Early Buddhist tantras, such as the <em>Guhyasamāja-tantra</em> and others, teach many practices employing sexual substances, including the physical practice of sexual yoga. Particular versions of psychosomatic fire oblation are also carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga between a male practitioner and his female partner(s). In these versions, his bodily substances and penis are respectively equated with clarified butter (ghee) and a ladle to offer it, and his female partner’s vagina is regarded as a hearth or sacrificial ground. The idea that sexual intercourse has the significance of fire oblation appears in ancient Brahmanism. The <em>Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad</em> teaches:</p>
<p>[The essence] of man is semen. Prajāpati (i.e., the Creator) then thought to himself: “Now, why don’t I prepare a base for that semen?” So he created woman and, after creating her, had intercourse with her. A man, therefore, should have intercourse with a woman. Prajāpati stretched out from himself the elongated stone for pressing Soma (i.e., the penis to ejaculate semen) and impregnated her with it. Her vulva is the sacrificial ground; her pubic hair is the sacred grass; her labia majora are the Soma-press; and her labia minora are the fire blazing at the center. A man who engages in sexual intercourse with this knowledge obtains as great a world as a man who performs a Soma sacrifice, and he appropriates to himself the merits of the women with whom he has sex.15</p>
<p>Having children to continue one’s family line is an obligation (<em>dharma</em>) of adult males of the twice-born class in Brahmanism. In order to have children, he must marry an appropriate woman and have intercourse with her. The passage in the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣad</em> explains sexual intercourse as an obligation derived from the creative deed of the Creator, having the same significance as a <em>soma</em> sacrifice (a Brahmanical fire oblation ritual). In contrast, Buddhist versions of sexual psychosomatic fire oblation are not intended for twice-born males to fulfill Brahmanical dharma. They are instead intended for male Buddhist <em>tāntrika</em>s to make oblation to deities through nonconceptual meditation, as discussed later. However, the Brahmanical idea that righteous copulation has the significance of fire oblation appears to have assisted the development of the idea of the physical practice of sexual yoga as a practice of Buddhist fire oblation.</p>
<p>Sometime shortly after the eighth century, composers of later Buddhist tantras preserved this practice to a certain extent by internalizing sexual practices. This was an attempt to resolve the contradiction between monastic vows of celibacy and engaging in sexual practices, which occurred as tantric traditions originating outside monasteries were incorporated into monastic Buddhism. The same attempt can be said of some versions of psychosomatic fire oblation in which the physical practice of sexual yoga is not a necessary component. Generally such internalized sexual practices equate female partners with channels, a particular <em>cakra</em> (or <em>cakra</em>s), and/or the yogic subtle fire in the male practitioner’s body. Alternatively, in some versions of psychosomatic fire oblation the metaphor of the penis as an offering ladle and the female partner’s vagina as a hearth are identified, respectively, with a particular channel and <em>cakra</em> in the male practitioner’s body.</p>
<h2 id="materials">MATERIALS</h2>
<p>Except for works that give only brief or obscure explanations, which therefore make it difficult to know details of the practice or to judge with certainty whether they really explain this type of fire oblation, available textual sources suggest that Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation appeared around or after the ninth century. The next discussion examines the structures of Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation, using mainly the following six works that provide the most detailed descriptions:</p>
<p>Because many of the instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation given in minor Buddhist works are identical with, or similar to, the instructions given in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> and the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>, and especially those given in the former text, the instructions in these works can be considered to be the most popular in South Asian Buddhism.18 We first investigate the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> (1) and the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> (2), then the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> (3) and the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> (4), and finally the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> (5) and the <em>Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi</em> (6). This order is followed for the following reasons:</p>
<p>•Instructions on the psychosomatic fire oblation in the six works can be grouped into two in terms of the differing ways of performance: texts 1 and 2 show the first way of performance, and texts 3, 4, 5, and 6 show the second. It is also possible to group them into three in terms of the differing manner of internalization of ritual items: 1 and 2 show the first, 3 and 4 the second, and 5 and 6 the third.</p>
<p>•The instruction in text 2 is very likely to be a redaction of the instruction in text 1. Text 6 is an extensive manual of fire oblation based on the instruction on fire oblation in text 5.</p>
<p>•It is difficult to determine whether the instruction in text 2 or those in numbers 3, 4, and 5 were composed earlier,19 but we can say that the former instruction reflects the older idea of sexual practices (i.e., as a physical practice of sexual yoga) and the latter instructions reflect the newer idea (i.e., as an internalized or symbolized form of sexual practice). Additionally, text 5 is later than 3 and 4, because it mentions the names of both those texts.20</p>
<h2 id="the-mahāmudrātilaka-and-the-vajramālā">THE <em>MAHĀMUDRĀTILAKA</em> AND THE <em>VAJRAMĀLĀ</em></h2>
<h3 id="instructions">Instructions</h3>
<p>The <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> (chapter 11) and the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> (chapter 60) explain the psychosomatic fire oblation as follows.</p>
<h4 id="1-mahāmudrātilaka-tantra">1. <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em></h4>
<p>Now, listen to the next [instruction].21 I will explain the fire oblation that (1) <em>removes sins</em>.</p>
<p>The sound (<em>nāda</em>) is in the navel area. The secret lotus (<em>guhyapaṅkaja</em>) is in the end of the sound.22 Having caused the self-dependent wind (<em>svatantrapavana</em>) of the reed (i.e., channel) to move in a circle in that [navel area], and through excellent fusion of the two forces (<em>dvīndriya</em>),23 he ignites (2) <em>a fire</em> (<em>tejas</em>) and reflects on [it]. The <em>cakra</em> in the top filled with clarified butter (<em>ājyapūrṇacakrāgra</em>; i.e., the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head) is taught to be a bowl [for clarified butter] (<em>sthālikā</em>). And also, the letter HA is explained to be a big ritual ladle (<em>srukka</em>).24 The <em>vajra</em> (i.e., penis) is taught to be a small ritual ladle (<em>sruvā</em>) in this [system]. The <em>bhaga</em> (i.e., vagina) is known as a hearth (<em>kuṇḍa</em>), and the five sense faculties (<em>pañcendriya</em>) as rice (<em>vrīhi</em>). The [five] aggregates (<em>skandha</em>) are firewood (<em>samidha</em>). The awakening mind (<em>bodhimānasa</em>) is the best-quality clarified butter (<em>ājya</em>).</p>
<p>From the new moon day up to the full moon day he should perform [this sexual practice] and send [the awakening mind into the vagina-hearth]. (3) <em>He should never spill the drop-only (bindumātra, i.e., the awakening mind) outside of the hearth by means of the small ritual ladle</em>. (4) <em>One should please with oblation those such as the buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, dānavas, rākṣasas, and the eight great world-protectors. An offering to Vajrasattva is taught to be an oblation with a full ladle (pūrṇāhuti)</em>. The oblation should be made carefully with mantras, which are <em>hūṃ</em> and <em>phaṭ</em> placed on the moonstone (i.e., the practitioner visualizes the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ on the tip of his <em>vajra</em>).25 (5)<em>Ḍākinīs and many Mothers in this [place of performance or system] are appeased through this</em>. (6) <em>They grant a great accomplishment (mahāsiddhi, such as supernatural powers), which is desirable and hoped in mind</em>.</p>
<p>Thus has been explained this fire oblation, which (7) <em>realizes all [accomplishments]</em>.</p>
<p>Thus is the eleventh chapter on the internal fire oblation (TTP: “the fire oblation in the real”) in the glorious <em>Mahāmudrātilaka</em>.</p>
<h4 id="2-vajramālā-tantra">2. <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em></h4>
<p>Now, listen to the next [instruction].26 I will explain the eminent internal fire oblation, in accordance with which he should constantly perform the marvelous fire oblation by means of substances moving inside which are fluid (i.e., the awakening mind); by means of fuel (<em>bud shing</em>), which are the five aggregates (<em>phung po lnga</em>) born out of the subliminal impressions of [past] discrimination (<em>rnam rtog bag chags sa bon</em>); and by means of (1) <em>the fire of great yogic gnosis (rnal ’byor ye shes chen po’i me)</em>.</p>
<p>The sound (<em>sgra tsam</em>) is in the navel area. The external of the sound is a secret lotus (<em>gsang pad ma</em>).27 In that [navel area], by the fire ignited with the self-dependent wind (<em>rang rgyud rlung</em>) [and through] the fusion of the two forces (<em>dbang po gnyis</em>),28 the light shines brightly. The secret lotus in the top filled with clarified butter (<em>rtse mar gang gsang pad ma</em>; i.e., the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head) is proclaimed to be a bowl [for clarified butter] (<em>snod</em>) in this [system]. The letter HAṂ is explained to be a big ritual ladle (<em>dgang gzar</em>). The <em>vajra</em> (<em>rdo rje</em>, i.e., the penis) is taught to be a small ritual ladle (<em>blugs gzar</em>). The <em>bhaga</em> (<em>bha ga</em>; i.e., the vagina) is known as a hearth (<em>thab khung</em>), and the five sense faculties (<em>dbang po lnga</em>) as an offered article (<em>bsreg rdzas</em>). The [five] aggregates are firewood (<em>yam shing</em>). Clarified butter (<em>mar</em>) is explained to be the awakening mind (<em>byang chub sems</em>).</p>
<p>From the new moon day up to the full moon day he should perform [this sexual practice] and send [the awakening mind to his penis-ladle inserted into the vagina-hearth]. (2) <em>The hearth is explained to be drop-only (thig le tsam,</em> i.e., <em>the awakening mind). The small ritual ladle never spills out</em>. (3) <em>One should be pleased through the incessant fire oblation to the buddhas, Moharati and so on, bodhisattvas such as Rūpavajra and so on, and the ten krodharājas (“furious kings”). An offering to Vajrasattva is taught to be an oblation with a full ladle (dgang blugs)</em>. The oblation should be made according to prescription with mantras having <em>hūṃ</em> and <em>phaṭ</em> (i.e., the practitioner visualizes the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ on the tip of his <em>vajra</em>).29 (4)<em>If those residing in the body are appeased through this,</em> [<em>there will be</em>] <em>the supreme samaya</em> (<em>dam tshig</em>),30 <em>having been granted an accomplishment</em> (<em>dngos grub) as he hopes in mind</em>.</p>
<p>This fire oblation is explained to be the highest. (5)[<em>It</em>] <em>brings all accomplishments as fruits</em>.</p>
<p>The sixtieth chapter on the internal fire oblation in the glorious <em>Vajramālābhisamayamahāyoga-tantra</em>.</p>
<p>Psychosomatic fire oblation is called “internal fire oblation” (<em>adhyātmahoma,</em> according to the Sanskrit manuscript) or “fire oblation in the real” (<em>don dam pa’i sbyin sreg;</em> *<em>paramārthahoma</em>, according to the Tibetan translation) in the last paragraph of the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra.</em> It is called “internal (<em>nang gi bdag nyid</em>) fire oblation” in the second and last paragraphs of the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em>. We will now examine the passages just translated, using other chapters of both tantras that give related information as supporting materials. (The italicized words or sentences with subscripts in the translation above are referred to in the following examination as “line 1,” “line 2,” etc.)</p>
<h3 id="internal-forms-of-ritual-items">Internal Forms of Ritual Items</h3>
<p>Internal forms of ritual items are described in the second paragraph in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> and the first and second paragraphs in the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> (summarized in table 1).</p>
<p>TABLE 1.<br>

a The <em>cakra</em> or secret lotus in the top means the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head.</p>
<p>b The letter HAṂ is at the center of the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head. The letter HAṂ consists of “HA” and “Ṃ (<em>anusvāra</em>).” The HA-part of the letter HAṂ is identified with a big ritual ladle in the <em>Mahāmudrātilakatantra</em>.</p>
<p>c The pair of opposite words <em>vajra</em> and <em>bhaga</em> is important in esoteric Buddhism. These two words have many meanings. The primary meaning of these two words is penis and vagina, respectively. It is most likely that their meanings in the teachings translated above are also the penis of a practitioner and the vagina of his female partner(s) because prescriptions on ejaculation are given (: line 4 in the <em>Mahāmudrātilakatantra</em> and line 2 in the <em>Vajramālātantra</em>). Gambhīravajra’s <em>Guhyārthaprakāśa</em> also interprets the <em>vajra</em> and <em>bhaga</em> as the penis and vagina.</p>
<p>A small ritual ladle and a hearth are the <em>vajra</em> (i.e., the penis) and the <em>bhaga</em> (i.e., the vagina), respectively: the psychosomatic fire oblation is carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga between a male practitioner and his female partner(s) in these two tantras. The duration of time appropriate for this practice is from the new moon day up to the full moon day (i.e., “the white half of a month,” considered the auspicious half of a month). It is probable that this practice is performed in some sort of tantric festival where male and female <em>tāntrika</em>s (tantric practitioners) gather during the auspicious part of a month; it is also probable that a practitioner performs it privately with his female partner during that time.</p>
<p>The texts give only brief explanations of some of the steps constituting the entire process of this practice. However, it is possible to reconstruct the outline of the entire process as follows. Having visualized the letters HŪṂ and PHAṬ on the tip of his penis (i.e., a small ritual ladle), a male practitioner has sex with his female partner(s). Through the union of their genital organs the practitioner controls the movements of the winds in his body and ignites the yogic subtle fire. The yogic subtle fire blazes upward, burning up concepts such as “the five sense faculties” (i.e., rice or offered articles) and “the five aggregates” (i.e., firewood and fuel) that the practitioner conceives. Then the yogic subtle fire heats the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in his head (i.e., a bowl for clarified butter). The great bliss <em>cakra</em> has the letter HAṂ (i.e., a large ritual ladle) at its center. When heated by the yogic subtle fire, the <em>bindu</em> (“drop”) of the <em>candra-bindu</em> part (i.e., the Ṃ part) of the HAṂ letter is refined into the body fluid “awakening mind” (i.e., clarified butter), and it flows out of the great bliss <em>cakra</em> through the HA part of the letter HAṂ (i.e., a large ritual ladle). The awakening mind flows downward in his body. He offers the awakening mind to the vagina of his female partner(s) (i.e., hearth) through his penis (i.e., the small ritual ladle).</p>
<p>The <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> and the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> offer different views regarding whether the practitioner ejaculates the “awakening mind” into his partner’s vagina in the last step of the sexual yoga. The <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> seems to teach that the practitioner should ejaculate into the vagina without fail (line 3). On the other hand, the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> rejects ejaculation (line 2). The latter opinion accords with the general opinion in Buddhist traditions of sexual yoga. The intention of the latter tantra is probably that sexual intercourse while keeping the awakening mind in the penis is the righteous practice of oblation.31</p>
<p>As shown in table 1, things that are offered are grouped into three in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> (1, 2, 3) and into four in the <em>Vajramālātantra</em> (1, 2, 3, 4). From this classification we can interpret that psychosomatic fire oblation has two aspects: as a practice of oblation and as a nonconceptual meditation. (3) The awakening mind (i.e., inner clarified butter) is offered to the female partner’s body hearth and, through that hearth, to recipient deities. (1) How to offer the “five sense faculties” (i.e., inner rice, or inner offered articles excluding clarified butter) is not explained in the texts, but it can be inferred that the practitioner’s concept “five sense faculties” is burned up by his yogic subtle fire and is offered through that fire to recipient deities.32 These are practices of oblation. The concepts “five sense faculties” and “five aggregates” (i.e., inner firewood and fuel) (1, 2, 4) that the practitioner conceives are burned up and disintegrated by the yogic fire. This is therefore a practice of nonconceptual meditation.</p>
<p>The concepts “five sense faculties” and “five aggregates” are Buddhist frameworks of the elements that constitute an individual self. This suggests that the practitioner renounces his erroneous attachment to the concepts that frame his own self by means of nonconceptual meditation on the yogic subtle fire. The yogic subtle fire is named “the fire of great yogic gnosis” (a variant name of “the fire of gnosis”) in the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> (line 1), while it is merely called “fire” in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> (line 2). The term “the fire of great yogic gnosis” is probably intended to emphasize its function of disintegrating concepts.</p>
<h3 id="recipients-of-oblation">Recipients of Oblation</h3>
<h4 id="recipients-in-the-mahāmudrātilaka">Recipients in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka</em></h4>
<p>The <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> mentions deities (or holy human beings) who receive, or are pleased with, inner oblations in lines 4 and 5. Buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, <em>dānava</em>s, <em>rākṣasa</em>s, the eight world-protectors, and Vajrasattva are spiritual leaders, followers, or protectors of Buddhism, respectively. They reside in various places of the universe.33 “<em>Ḍākinī</em>s and mothers in this” are probably both human and spiritual female participants at the place of performance, especially the female partner (or partners) of the practitioner, who receives the “awakening mind” from the practitioner through sexual yoga. Indeed, these deities or holy human beings are outside the body of the practitioner. However, for the practitioner, they are undivided from himself both epistemologically and ontologically. The key deity is Vajrasattva. Chapter 10 of the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>, which gives general information about practices of internal oblation, reads:</p>
<p>[The external] ceremony of installation, <em>maṇḍala</em>, and fire oblation; he should never perform this. He should always make oblation to himself by means of [bodily substances such as] feces, adamantine water, jewel, and so on because what exists in this [universe] are evidently representations of the mind, which is the mind-<em>vajra</em>. This All (i.e., the universe) is of good reflection, a manifestation of the mind-<em>vajra</em>. Its form … (text unreadable; TTP has “Its manifested form [as object] is not the mind [itself]”) and is of the characteristic of emptiness, and since emptiness is not also perceived as object, All is like the sky. Even a man who thus knows the purity should respect … (text corrupted; TTP reads “channels and so on, too”). Thus All consists of the mind. There is nothing besides the mind. He is himself Lord Vajrasattva. He should wander in the form of the mind. Besides the mind, there is no being that is the highest in the form of a deity.34</p>
<p>Since all beings are none other than the practitioner’s mind, that is, the mind-<em>vajra</em> (which is, however, ultimately empty), what the practitioner should do is practice oblation as oblation to himself as Vajrasattva, using his own bodily substances. This explains well the logic of psychosomatic fire oblation. Vajrasattva is the tantric lord or the ideal type of tantric practitioner, on the one hand, and is the practitioner himself, on the other. Since the practitioner knows the truth of the mind-<em>vajra</em>, all outer recipient deities (or holy human beings) are, for him, within himself. The practitioner’s self-oblation has universal effect because his mind is of a universal nature.</p>
<p>What, then, is the relationship between the realization of that inclusive mind and nonconceptual meditation (i.e., renunciation of erroneous attachment to concepts that frame one’s individual being)? The text does not clearly explain this relationship. However, it can be inferred that the former meditative state of mind is attained helped by the latter meditation because the latter meditation by means of the yogic subtle fire starts before the inner oblation which is done in the former meditative state.</p>
<p>I argue that the recipient <em>ḍākinī</em>s and mothers were female partner(s) of the practitioner. It may also be posited that the same <em>ḍākinī</em>s and mothers are channels in the practitioner’s body for the following reasons: The <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> has an idea that channels are internal forms of <em>ḍākinī</em>s (it gives detailed explanation of the circle of channels in chapter 4: channels running through the six <em>cakra</em>s).35 The passage in chapter 10 translated above proclaims, “Even a man who thus knows the purity should respect <em>channels</em> and so on.”36</p>
<p>Fruits that can be attained through the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation are mentioned in lines 1, 6, and 7. Lines 5 and 6 relate that accomplishments (such as supernatural powers and superhuman experiences) are given to the practitioner by the <em>ḍākinī</em>s and mothers in return for his service to them. It is possible to interpret this as follows: Externally, the <em>ḍākinī</em>s and mothers as female participants of this practice give accomplishments to the practitioner by their superhuman power. Internally, accomplishments are the results of the practitioner’s self-empowerment: the <em>ḍākinī</em>s and mothers as channels in his body become increasingly active through this practice, which results in the development of his inner spiritual powers.37</p>
<h4 id="recipients-in-the-vajramālā">Recipients in the <em>Vajramālā</em></h4>
<p>The <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> explains the idea that the practitioner and the recipient deities are inseparable, using the idea of the body <em>maṇḍala</em>.38</p>
<p>The <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> mentions buddhas, Moharati and so on, bodhisattvas such as Rūpavajra and so on, the ten furious kings, and Vajrasattva as deities who receive inner oblations (line 3) and describes them as “those residing in the body” (line 4). We can identify these recipient deities with the deities constituting a body <em>maṇḍala</em> (<em>lus kyi dkyil ’ khor</em>) expounded in chapter 45 of the same tantra.39 The structure of this body <em>maṇḍala</em> is formed by the traditional Buddhist frameworks of an individual being: (1) the five aggregates (<em>phung po</em>, *<em>skandha</em>), (2) the five material causes (*<em>dhātu</em>), (3) the twelve bases of experience (<em>skye mched</em>, *<em>āyatana</em>), (4) channels (<em>rtsa</em>, *<em>nāḍī</em>), (5) gnosis (<em>ye shes</em>, *<em>jñāna</em>), and (6) other elements of the body (<em>lus kyi chos rnams</em>, *<em>kāyadharma, dhātu</em>, or the like). These frameworks correspond to the five buddhas (1), the five <em>vidyā</em>-goddesses (i.e., Moharati and four others) (2), twelve bodhisattvas (i.e., Rūpavajrā and eleven others) (3), Maitreya Bodhisattva (4), Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva (5), and the ten furious kings (6), respectively. Chapter 64 of the same tantra also illustrates a body <em>maṇḍala</em> (<em>sku yi dkyil ’ khor</em>) that has almost the same structure as the body <em>maṇḍala</em> in chapter 45.40 In chapter 64, all the <em>vidyā</em> goddesses, bodhisattvas, and the ten furious kings constituting the body <em>maṇḍala</em> are titled Bhagavat or Tathāgata, and the body <em>maṇḍala</em> is defined as a collective body of perfect buddhas (<em>rdzogs pa’i sangs rgyas</em>) and as the body of Vajrasattva.41 The body <em>maṇḍala</em> described in these two chapters can be summarized as shown in table 2. (The Sanksrit names of the deities were restored by consulting the <em>Guhyasamāja-tantra</em>, Candrakīrti’s <em>Pradīpodyotana</em>, some other texts of the Guhyasamāja tradition that have parallel or similar passages, and Abhayākaragupta’s <em>Vajrāvalī</em> and <em>Niṣpannayogāvalī</em>.)</p>

<p>g The text gives the name of its deity, but the object represented by this deity is not mentioned. Hence I supplemented.</p>
<p>The five aggregates, the five material causes (forming the form aggregates), the six sense faculties (in the twelve bases of experience), channels (interpretable as “sinews” in this context), gnosis, joints, and the other elements of the body are frameworks of an individual human being; the five material causes and the six sense objects (in the twelve bases of experience) are frameworks of the outer world; and all these frameworks of existence constitute the body <em>maṇḍala</em>, which is Vajrasattva, that is, the practitioner himself. Thus, the body <em>maṇḍala</em> is a concept to explain the practitioner as a universal being that includes outer existences within. We can infer that the practitioner becomes aware of his own existence as a body <em>maṇḍala</em> through the nonconceptual meditation (i.e., renunciation of erroneous attachment to concepts framing one’s individual being) discussed above.</p>
<p>The fruits that can be attained through this practice are mentioned in lines 4 and 5. Line 4 explains that these fruits are given to the practitioner by the recipient deities in return for his service to them. As previously mentioned, the recipient deities are indivisible from the practitioner, and we can therefore interpret this give-and-take relationship as the practitioner’s self-empowerment.</p>

<h3 id="instructions-1">Instructions</h3>
<p>The <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> (chapter 6.3) and the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> (chapter 44) explain psychosomatic fire oblation as follows:</p>
<h4 id="3-saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra">3. <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em></h4>
<p>Fire oblation42 is performed in (1) <em>the fire of wisdom</em> (<em>prajñāgni</em>), which is shining greatly, by use of offered articles (<em>havis</em>) that are both internal, such as the semen and other [bodily substances] (<em>śukrādya</em>), and external, such as the form and other [sense objects] (<em>rūpādi</em>). (2)[<em>This practice</em>] <em>is proclaimed to be yogic oblation especially to those in the forms of deities, i.e., the six bases of experience</em> (<em>ṣaḍāyātana</em>), <em>the material causes</em> (<em>dhātu</em>), <em>and the aggregates</em> (<em>skandha</em>), <em>and also to ḍākinīs because they are made oblation to through that</em> [<em>practice</em>].</p>
<p>The skull bone in the head (<em>śiraḥkapāla</em>)—this is explained as a bowl for offered articles (<em>havirbhājana</em>). [The channel named] <em>rasanā</em> is known as a small ritual ladle (<em>sruva</em>). A large ritual ladle (<em>pātrī</em>) and [its] mouth (<em>vaktra</em>) are taught as the embodiment of [the channel named] <em>lalanā</em> and the <em>cakra</em> in the heart (<em>hṛccakra</em>). And a hearth (<em>kuṇḍa</em>) is the circle in the navel area (<em>nābhimaṇḍala</em>). The fire of Brahman (<em>brahmāgni</em>) is fanned with the wind of action (<em>karmamāruta</em>) and resides at the <em>trikaṭi</em> (i.e., the abdominal point where the three channels join together). <em>Mantra</em> is explained to be sound (<em>nāda</em>). Recitation (<em>japa</em>) should be cycling (<em>āvartana</em>). Visualization (<em>bhāvanā</em>) is manifestation (<em>pratibhāsa</em>) through nondual identification with the <em>maṇḍala</em>.</p>
<p>This [practice] is based on the innate (<em>sahaja</em>) and is of the nature of the Jinas’ <em>maṇḍala</em>. (3) <em>The mind-king</em> (<em>cittarāja) is a teacher</em> (<em>ācārya</em>) <em>because of</em> [<em>its</em>] <em>function as a superintendent of the maṇḍala</em>. All [practices] such as this sort should be understood in this very [body] as [above] explained.</p>
<h4 id="4-vajraḍāka-tantra">4. <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em></h4>
<p>[The supreme goddess]43 is fanned with the wind of action (<em>karmamāruta</em>) as (1) <em>the fire of gnosis</em> (<em>jñānāgni</em>) <em>whose fuels</em> (<em>indhana) are the</em> [<em>five</em>] <em>aggregates and other</em> [<em>mental constructs</em>] (<em>skandhādi</em>). She is blazing on this circle in the navel area (<em>nābhimaṇḍala</em>). (2)[<em>She is</em>] <em>the fire of Brahman</em> (<em>brahmāgni</em>) <em>standing at the trikaṭi</em> (i.e., the abdominal point where the three channels join together). A large ritual ladle (<em>pātrī</em>) is [the channel named] <em>lalanā</em>. A small ritual ladle and [its] mouth (<em>sruvānana</em>) is declared to be [the channel named] <em>rasanā</em>. A bejeweled <em>vajra</em> attached to [the lower end of] the handle [of the ladle] (<em>daṇḍadharatnavajra</em>) is, that is to say, one’s <em>kuliśa</em> (i.e., penis). A bowl for the offered article (<em>havirbhājana</em>) is the skull bone (<em>kapāla</em>), and all offered articles should be offered.44 This process is performed.</p>
<p>[Thus] explained to you. O, goddess! This is indeed the supreme [form of] fire oblation. When performed in this way, (3) <em>one attains firm meditation, and it does not diminish</em>. This method is proclaimed to be common to all tantras.</p>
<p>No particular name is given to the psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>. It is called “the supreme” (<em>niruttara</em>) form of “the internal fire oblation” (<em>adhyātmahoma</em>) in the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>.45 Supporting materials in this section are Abhayākaragupta’s <em>Āmnāyamañjarī</em>, a commentary on the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhavatantra</em>, and his <em>Jyotirmañjarī</em> (along with Naoji Okuyama’s study of them),46 and other chapters of both tantras that give related information.47 The type of inner fire oblation that Abhayākaragupta calls “internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters” refers to the psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>.</p>

a The <em>Vajraḍākatantra</em> mentions offered articles in the skull bone in the head, but it does not detail them.</p>
<p>b According to Abhayākaragupta, the Rasanā channel is the handle part of a small ritual ladle and its mouth part is the lotus in the throat (i.e., the enjoyment <em>cakra</em>) in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>.</p>
<p>c According to Abhayākaragupta, the Lalanā channel is the handle part of a big ritual ladle and its mouth part is the <em>cakra</em> in the heart (i.e., the Dharma <em>cakra</em>) in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>.</p>
<p>d According to Abhayākaragupta, a bejeweled <em>vajra</em> is attached to the lower ends of both Rasanā and Lalanā. However, unlike the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>, he relates that the bejeweled <em>vajra</em>, along with a hearth, is situated in the navel area.</p>
<p>e The <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> does not explain clearly which bodily area is the hearth. We can construe the circle in the navel area as the hearth because it is the only area in the body that produces fire in this practice. However, it is not always necessary to interpret that the place of ignition of fire in the body is an inner hearth: the place of ignition of fire is the navel area in the body of a male practitioner, while an inner hearth is the vagina of a female partner in the texts of the first group as we observed in the previous section of this essay; and the place of ignition is the soles of the feet of a practitioner, while inner hearths are bodily areas above the foot-soles in the <em>Ḍākārṇava</em> system of psychosomatic fire oblation (as will be investigated in the next subsection of this essay). Hence, I wrote “Circle in the navel area” with round brackets in the table.</p>
<p>f According to Abhayākaragupta, it is the sound of the blazing of this yogic subtle fire.</p>
<p>g According to Abhayākaragupta, it means to repeat this practice of blazing yogic subtle fire.</p>
<p>h According to Abhayākaragupta, it means manifestation of the body <em>maṇḍala</em>.</p>
<p>Internal forms of ritual items in these two tantras can be summarized as shown in table 3. The offered article in the skull bone (i.e., the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head) is the body fluid, which Abhayākaragupta calls “the awakening mind.” The body fluid represents both bodily substances (semen and so on, internal offered articles) and external objects (the five sense objects, external offered articles) in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>.48</p>
<p>Concepts (such as the five aggregates, etc.) are equated with fuel for the fire in the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>. These concepts are burned up and disintegrated by the yogic subtle fire, which is called “the fire of gnosis” (line 1) and “the fire of Brahman” (line 2). On the other hand, the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> does not mention fuel, nor does it clearly mention the meditative disintegration of the five aggregates and other concepts except for the sense objects. However, the yogic subtle fire is called “the fire of wisdom” (line 1). This appears to suggest that in this practice of fire oblation the practitioner renounces his erroneous attachment not only to the sense objects but also to the five aggregates (and other concepts). This interpretation is supported by Abhayākaragupta’s comment that the function of the fire of wisdom in this practice is “to dispel whole darkness of discrimination completely.”49Unlike in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em> and <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em>, a small ritual ladle and a hearth are not respectively equated with the genital organs of a male practitioner and his female partner(s) in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> or <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>. As shown in table 3, a small ritual ladle, a large ritual ladle, and a hearth are identified with the <em>rasanā</em> channel, the <em>lalanā</em> channel, and the circle in the navel area where these two channels join together (i.e., the creation <em>cakra</em>), respectively. All these channels and the navel <em>cakra</em> exist in the practitioner’s body. The physical practice of sexual yoga is not an indispensable component of the practices of psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> or <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>,50 although there may be cases in which a practitioner performs sexual yoga as a practice that supports controlling the movements of the winds to ignite the yogic subtle fire in his body, as Abhayākaragupta suggests.51 However, the physical practice of sexual yoga does not serve as a framework for the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation in these two tantras.</p>
<p>We can draw an outline of the practice as follows: A practitioner controls the movements of the wind of action in his body and ignites the yogic subtle fire on the circle in his navel area (i.e., the creation <em>cakra</em>). The yogic subtle fire, which Abhayākaragupta calls “Caṇḍālī,” blazes upward. In the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> the yogic subtle fire, “the fire of gnosis,” burns up and disintegrates all concepts such as the five aggregates and so on, of which the practitioner conceives. The yogic subtle fire heats up the skullbone in the head (i.e., the great bliss <em>cakra</em>). When heated, the skullbone in the head produces the body fluid, which Abhayākaragupta calls “the awakening mind.” In the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>, the body fluid symbolizes both internal body substances and external objects (“the five sense objects”). Then the body fluid flows downward in the practitioner’s body. According to Abhayākaragupta, the body fluid flows downward through the central channel, <em>avadhūtī</em>, passing through the throat <em>cakra</em> (i.e., the enjoyment <em>cakra</em>) and the heart <em>cakra</em> (i.e., the Dharma <em>cakra</em>), which are the mouth of an inner small ritual ladle (i.e., the mouth of the <em>rasanā</em> channel) and the mouth of an inner large ritual ladle (i.e., the mouth of the <em>lalanā</em> channel), respectively. Finally the body fluid flows into the creation <em>cakra</em> (i.e., the inner hearth).</p>
<h3 id="recipients-of-oblation-1">Recipients of Oblation</h3>
<h4 id="recipients-in-the-saṃpuṭodbhava">Recipients in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava</em></h4>
<p>The recipients of inner oblations are the deities that represent the six bases of experience, the material causes, and the aggregates and <em>ḍākinī</em>s in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> (line 2). They constitute a body <em>maṇḍala</em>; Abhayākaragupta comments that they are inner deities and that the <em>ḍākinī</em>s are channels.52 The names of these deities are given in chapter 5.2.53 Table 4 shows the body <em>maṇḍala</em>.</p>
<p>It has almost the same structure as the body <em>maṇḍala</em> in the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em> (table 2).54 The body <em>maṇḍala</em> is superintended, or represented, by the mind (i.e., the mind-king) of the practitioner (line 3). Abhayākaragupta comments that the mind (i.e., the mind-king) means the nondual mind, which he calls “the awakening mind-<em>vajra</em>” (<em>byang chub sems rdo rje</em>).55 It is probably of the same kind as the mind-<em>vajra</em> in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>, in which the practitioner and outer deities are indivisible. This meditative state of the body <em>maṇḍala</em> is probably experienced with the help of nonconceptual meditation on the fire of wisdom.</p>
<p>Fruits of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation are not mentioned in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>. According to Abhayākaragupta, its fruit is the perfection of “supreme bliss.” He explains the “internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters” (i.e., the psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>) as “a means for perfection of the supreme bliss” (<em>mchog tu dga’ ba phun sum tshogs pa’i rgyu</em>) in his <em>Jyotirmañjarī</em>.56 He seems to have done so based on the following facts: the subtle-body yoga, in the form of the yoga of perfection process, serves as a means for attaining nondual reality in the form of bliss; the subtle-body yoga constitutes the basis of the “internal fire oblation with no dependence on external matters” and the sequence of practice of this fire oblation is similar to that of the yoga of perfection process, although the psychosomatic fire oblation and the yoga of perfection process are taught separately in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> and should not be completely equated.</p>
<h4 id="recipients-in-the-vajraḍāka">Recipients in the <em>Vajraḍāka</em></h4>
<p>The <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> does not mention recipient deities. Indeed, we find in chapter 1 an explanation of a <em>maṇḍala</em> of deities whose structure is quite similar to the body <em>maṇḍala</em> in the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> shown in table 4.57 In chapter 14, the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> teaches that <em>ḍākinī</em>s are channels and that the body <em>maṇḍala</em> is the circle of channels.58 But these deities and <em>ḍākinī</em>s are not described as the recipients of the oblations in the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. Nevertheless, the lack of description of recipient deities is not a shortcoming of this teaching but simply marks the nature of the psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>.</p>

<p>First, in its instruction on the psychosomatic fire oblation, the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> does not mention any concept, such as the body <em>maṇḍala</em> or the like, that frames a practitioner’s existence to include outer existences within it. Second, the yogic subtle fire is defined as the fire of gnosis that burns up concepts such as the five aggregates and so forth (line 1). Third, a fruit of this fire oblation practice is the attainment of firm meditation that does not diminish (line 3). From these we can interpret that the psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> is a yogic practice to attain the meditative state of nonconceptual reality, rather than being a practice of oblation. The body fluid meditated in this fire oblation can be interpreted to be an inner source of experience of nonconceptual reality, rather than an inner article to offer deities.</p>
<p>I argue that integration of a practice of oblation and nonconceptual meditation into subtle-body yoga constitutes the structure of psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>, the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em>, and the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>. On the other hand, with regard to the practices of oblation and nonconceptual meditation, the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> emphasizes the latter, and the former practice is not manifest. The psychosomatic fire oblation in the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em> appears to be close to the meditation of perfection process, the highest meditation whose purpose is not to make oblations but to attain ultimate reality. This may be why psychosomatic fire oblation is taught to be the “supreme” form of internal fire oblation in the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-dḍākārnṇava-system">THE DḌĀKĀRNṆAVA SYSTEM</h2>
<h4 id="5-the-ḍākārṇava-tantra">5. The <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em></h4>
<p>The <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> explains psychosomatic fire oblation in chapter 24. No particular name is given to this practice. The instruction is as follows:59</p>
<p>What is related to all tantras is explained since [it is] being taught a little.</p>
<p>A hearth manifested in the navel area is round (1). A square [hearth] is in the heart (2). A triangular hearth is in the private part (3). A hexagonal [hearth] is at the urethral orifice (4). A heptagonal [hearth] is in the throat (5). An octagonal [hearth] is in the head (6). An enneagonal [hearth] is between the eyebrows (7). A pentagonal [hearth] is in the tuft of the head (8). A decagonal [hearth] is in the forehead (9). [These hearths are] rooted in [the areas] where winds come.</p>
<p>One should make oblation of all the body substances (<em>dhātu</em>) by carriage of wind. At the time of performance in this very way, the wise [use] little external [matter]. <em>Lalanā</em> and <em>rasanā</em> are the two [ritual ladles], i.e., a large ritual ladle (<em>sruci</em>) and a small ritual ladle (<em>sruva</em>) respectively. <em>Avadhūtī</em> is a bowl for clarified butter (<em>ājyasthālī</em>). (1)[<em>Each</em>] <em>hearth is each interval of her</em>. (2) <em>He should perform the all-effective fire oblation</em> (<em>sārvakarmikahoma</em>) <em>in this moment</em>. He should make oblation of all offered articles to that without hesitation.</p>

<p>Internal forms of ritual items can be summarized as shown in table 5. All items of fire oblation are internalized in the body of a male practitioner; the physical practice of sexual yoga is not an indispensable process in the psychosomatic fire oblation of the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em>.</p>
<p>The two tantras investigated earlier (namely, the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em> and the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>) and the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> have in common the idea that the left and right channels, the <em>lalanā</em> and <em>rasanā</em>, are the internal forms of a large ritual ladle and a small ritual ladle, respectively. The same can be said of the body substances, which are defined as inner offered articles in these scriptures. However, the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> identifies a bowl for clarified butter with the central channel <em>avadhūtī,</em> while all the other tantras we have examined here equate it with the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head. However, the former identification and the latter identification do not contradict each other, for <em>avadhūtī</em> originates in the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head, and is that through which the body fluid in the great bliss <em>cakra</em> is offered to the inner hearth.</p>
<p>All the other tantras we have examined mention only one inner hearth; the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em>, however, elaborates nine inner hearths (second paragraph). These nine hearths each have a different shape. They are located along the vertical centerline of the body in order and are linked together by the central channel, the <em>avadhūtī</em> (line 1),60 as shown in table 5. In other passages in chapter 24, the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> expounds the features of nine external hearths used in the external fire oblation ritual. The first eight external hearths have different ritual functions: pacifying (<em>śānti</em>), prospering (<em>puṣṭi</em>), bewitching (<em>vaśya</em>), subjugating (<em>abhicāra</em>), expelling (<em>uccāṭana</em>), estranging (<em>vidveṣa</em>), paralyzing (<em>stambhana</em>), and killing (<em>māraṇa</em>), respectively. The ninth hearth is effective for all eight of these functions (<em>sarvakarma</em>).</p>
<p>The nine internal hearths have the same shapes as the nine external hearths. We can therefore say that the nine internal hearths are interiorized forms of the nine external ones, and, for this reason, it is very likely that the different ritual functions ascribed to the nine external hearths are implicitly ascribed to the nine internal ones. The text says that this practice is “all-effective,” that is, effective for all kinds of actions (line 2). It is very likely that the psychosomatic practice of fire oblation is said to be all-effective because the practitioner visualizes in his body all of the nine hearths that comprise eight different functions.61</p>
<p>The explanation on psychosomatic fire oblation given in the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> lacks detailed information on the sequence of practice. Padmavajra’s <em>Vohitā</em>, a commentary on this tantra, gives only a brief comment and is not useful.62 Details of the sequence can be found in Jayasena’s <em>Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi</em>, a manual of both external and internal fire oblations in the <em>Ḍākārṇava</em> system. Jayasena calls psychosomatic fire oblation “the internal fire oblation” (<em>nang gi sbyin sreg</em>) and defines it as “the yoga of Caṇḍālī” (<em>gtun mo’i rnal ‘byor</em>, i.e., “the yoga of inner subtle fire”).63 Jayasena’s instruction on the internal fire oblation is next.</p>
<h4 id="6-jayasenas-ḍākārṇavahomavidhi">6. Jayasena’s <em>Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi</em></h4>
<p>Now I will explain the internal fire oblation.64</p>
<p>A practitioner, who applies himself most diligently to the internal, sits on a soft and wide seat. Having aroused compassion for all sentient beings, he transforms himself through meditation into Saṃvara, who is accompanied by Vārāhī of one face and two arms, in an instant.</p>
<p>There is a disk of wind produced from [the letter] YAṂ on the soles of the feet and a disk of fire from [the letter] RAṂ on that [disk of wind]. Subsequently, a hearth manifested in the navel area is round (1). A square [hearth] is in the heart (2). [A triangular hearth is in the private part (3)]. A hexagonal [hearth] is at the urethral orifice (4). A heptagonal [hearth] is in the throat (5). An octagonal [hearth] is in the head (6). An enneagonal [hearth] is between the eyebrows (7). A pentagonal [hearth] is in the tuft of the head (8). [A decagonal hearth is in the forehead (9)].65 Having meditated that all have the appearance of a channel-hearth in this way, he contemplates that [the letters] HŪṂ of blue color and VAṂ of red colo<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> are put together at the centers of all [those hearths]. He illuminates well [the body areas] between the tuft of the head and the penis, which are linked together by the <em>avadhūtī</em> channel and which are accompanied by the right and left channels (i.e., <em>rasanā</em> and <em>lalanā</em>).</p>
<p>Then he ignites a fire with the wind [blowing] on the soles of the feet through the yoga of controlling upward and downward [movements of the] wind.</p>
<p>He refines the awakening minds of all channels in the body, draws [them] into the right and left channels, and makes [them be] absorbed into [the letter] HAṂ at the top of the <em>avadhūtī</em> through those two channels. Subsequently, by means of those flowing down through the <em>avadhūtī,</em> [that is to say,] by means of oblation with a full ladle of the awakening minds to the flaming hearths, he fills all [those hearths with the awakening minds]. Contemplating that [the awakening minds] also spread into all channels in the body, he performs without interruption the yoga of collecting [the awakening minds] again. He will achieve all aims.</p>
<p>This is what is supreme among all. Having been taught by the master who had had the instruction, [it] was not concealed by me. Thus is the section of the internal fire oblation.</p>
<p>The yogic sequence of the internal fire oblation expounded in these passages can be summarized as follows: (1) transformation of the practitioner through meditation into the highest deity Saṃvara, in whose body the internal fire oblation is practiced (second paragraph); (2) visualization of an inner place of ignition (a fire disk and a wind disk on the soles of his feet), nine inner hearths, an inner bowl (i.e., the <em>avadhūtī</em>), and inner ritual ladles (i.e., the <em>lalanā</em> and <em>rasanā</em>) (third paragraph); (3) ignition of the yogic subtle fire (fourth paragraph); and (4) production of the body fluids called “the awakening mind” and oblation of them to the inner hearths (fifth paragraph). The first and second steps are preparatory meditations. The third step is the starting of the fire oblation. The fourth step is the performance of oblation. All the awakening minds are produced from channels throughout the body, are gathered to the letter HAṂ in the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in the head, and are offered to the inner hearths through the <em>avadhūtī</em> from the great bliss <em>cakra.</em></p>
<p>Through this practice, it is said, the practitioner achieves all aims. This appears to reflect the words in the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> that this fire oblation practice is all-effective (line 2 in the passages of the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em> translated earlier).</p>
<p>In the opening verses of his <em>Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi</em>, Jayasena declares that fire oblation is a means for delighting deities who appear in the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra:</em></p>
<p>“I will explain the fire oblation (i.e., both the external fire oblation and the internal fire oblation), which is a means for delighting deities of the glorious <em>Ḍākārṇava</em> and which is an oral instruction by many masters from this tantra.”67</p>
<p>How, then, are the recipient deities and the practitioner related? This is not clear. Jayasena does not use the idea of a body <em>maṇḍala</em> for framing the practitioner’s own being as inclusive of recipient deities. (Probably he followed the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em>, which does not mention a body <em>maṇḍala</em> in its teaching of psychosomatic fire oblation.) He does not mention the idea of the mind that includes outer deities within it (like the mind-<em>vajra</em> in the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>). The practitioner transforms himself through meditation into the highest deity Saṃvara in the first step of this practice. Saṃvara may have the same function as Vajrasattva of the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>. If so, the practitioner in the form of Saṃvara is inclusive of outer deities.</p>
<p>No matter what the actual relationship between recipient deities and the practitioner might be, it can be safely stated that the practice of oblation is an important element of the psychosomatic fire oblation in Jayasena’s manual, and what is emphasized as the purpose of this practice is that oblation to the deities brings achievement of all aims. On the other hand, the element of nonconceptual meditation is not articulated in this manual.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>In Buddhism, the <em>Hevajra-tantra</em> is the first scripture that systematized psychosomatic yoga, that is, the yoga based on one’s subtle body (i.e., one’s circle of channels). In tantras composed after the <em>Hevajra-tantra</em>, the technique of subtle-body yoga was applied to various kinds of practices in different ways. Psychosomatic fire oblation is an example of these applications of subtle-body yoga. This essay examined instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation given in (1) the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>, (2) the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em>, (3) the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>, (4) the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>, (5) the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em>, and (6) Jayasena’s <em>Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi</em>. Figure 1 shows a conclusion drawn from this examination.</p>

<p>FIGURE 1. Psychosomatic fire oblations in six works</p>
<p>The elements that comprise structures of practices of psychosomatic fire oblation in these six works are the practice of oblation, nonconceptual meditation, and subtle-body yoga. Subtle-body yoga is the basis. Through subtle-body yoga the practitioner carries out both a practice of oblation and nonconceptual meditation, or specifically either one of these two. The six works have different views on how to practice subtle-body yoga (i.e., the manner of performance of the ritual), how to interpret components of the subtle body (i.e., the manner of internalization of ritual items), and how to organize the practice of oblation along with nonconceptual meditation on that basis.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-performance">Ways of Performance</h3>
<p>Systems of psychosomatic fire oblation in the six works outlined can be grouped into two, in terms of the differing ways of performance.</p>
<p>The fire oblation in works 1 and 2 are carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga. A practitioner must perform it from the new moon day up to the full moon day, that is, the auspicious half of a month (suggesting that it is an auspicious practice). The sexual fire oblation explained in works 1 and 2 is probably carried out at some sort of tantric festival held during this auspicious term where male and female <em>tāntrika</em>s gather, or it is practiced privately between a male practitioner and his female partner during this time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the physical practice of sexual yoga is not an indispensable process in works 3, 4, 5, and 6. There may be cases in which a practitioner performs sexual yoga as a practice that supports controlling the movements of the winds to ignite the yogic subtle fire; however, this is not a framework of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. The appropriate time and place for such practice is not prescribed in these works.</p>
<p>Like the <em>Guhyasamāja-tantra</em>, early Buddhist tantras teach many sexual practices, including the physical practice of sexual yoga. Composers of later Buddhist tantras sometime shortly after the eighth century attempted to reshape some of the sexual practices into more internal forms that do not require the practice of sexual yoga. If instructions on psychosomatic fire oblation in works 1 and 2 are chronologically older than those in works 3 to 6, it is very likely that the change in the manner of performance from the former to the latter works is related to the attempt of the composers of later tantras to internalize the sexual practices. However, we do not have enough evidence to prove that the instructions in works 1 and 2 were really composed earlier than those in the other works. We can therefore describe the history of psychosomatic fire oblation as follows: this practice took two forms, that is, psychosomatic fire oblation carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga, which is related to the early tantric tradition of sexual yoga; and the more internal form of psychosomatic fire oblation, which is likely the result of certain composers of later tantras to internalize sexual practices.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-internalization-of-ritual-items">Ways of Internalization of Ritual Items</h3>
<p>In the external fire oblation ritual clarified butter (ghee) is offered to a ritual fire in a hearth by means of ritual ladles. These ritual items are internalized in different ways in the six works and can be grouped into three types.</p>
<p>According to works 1 and 2, in which psychosomatic fire oblation is carried out as a physical practice of sexual yoga, a male practitioner offers his “clarified butter in a bowl” (i.e., the body fluids produced in the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in his head) to his female partner’s “hearth” (i.e., the vagina) by means of a “large ritual ladle” (the letter HA or HAṂ in the great bliss <em>cakra</em>) and “small ritual ladle” (penis). Ejaculation is done in work 1, while it is prohibited in work 2; that is to say, the seminal fluid is not released from the penis inserted into the partner’s vagina.</p>
<p>All ritual items are internalized in the body of a male practitioner in works 3 and 4, in which the physical practice of sexual yoga is not a framework of the entire process of the psychosomatic fire oblation. A practitioner offers his “clarified butter in a bowl” (body fluids produced in the great bliss <em>cakra</em> in his head) through the <em>avadhūtī</em> channel to his internalized “hearth” (the creation <em>cakra</em> in the navel area) by means of the “small ritual ladle” (the <em>rasanā</em> channel [with the enjoyment <em>cakra</em> in his throat according to Abhayākaragupta]) and the “large ritual ladle” (the <em>lalanā</em> channel [with the Dharma <em>cakra</em> in his heart according to Abhayākaragupta]).</p>
<p>As in these works, all ritual items are also internalized in the body of a practitioner in works 5 and 6, in which sexual yoga is not a necessary practice. A bowl for clarified butter and clarified butter are the <em>avadhūtī</em> channel (at the top of which the great bliss <em>cakra</em> is located) and body fluids (which flow through the <em>avadhūtī</em> from the great bliss <em>cakra</em>), respectively. The two ritual ladles are the <em>lalanā</em> and the <em>rasanā</em> channels. The body fluids are produced in all channels throughout the body and are gathered to the letter HAṂ located at the center of the great bliss <em>cakra</em> through the <em>lalanā</em> and <em>rasanā.</em> There are nine inner hearths, internalized forms of the nine hearths for eight functions used in the external fire oblation ritual. These nine inner hearths are located along the vertical centerline of the body and are linked together by the <em>avadhūtī</em> channel. A practitioner offers his “clarified butter in a bowl” (body fluids that flow through <em>avadhūtī</em> from the great bliss <em>cakra</em>) to the “nine hearths” (the nine inner hearths) by use of the “large ritual ladle” (<em>lalanā</em>) and “small ritual ladle” (<em>rasanā</em>).</p>
<h3 id="a-practice-of-oblation-nonconceptual-meditation-and-subtle-body-yoga">**A Practice of Oblation, Nonconceptual Meditation, and Subtle-Body Yoga</h3>
<p>There are two principal elements of practice that constitute systems of psychosomatic fire oblation: the practice of oblation and nonconceptual meditation. From this viewpoint we can group the systems in the six works into three: In works 1, 2, and 3, the integration of a practice of oblation along with a nonconceptual meditation into subtle-body yoga constitutes the structure of the practice of psychosomatic fire oblation. In work 4 the practice of oblation is not specifically mentioned, and nonconceptual meditation is emphasized. The position of work 5 is not clear because of its lack of description. In work 6 the practice of oblation is emphasized, while nonconceptual meditation is not mentioned specifically.</p>
<p>Fruits mentioned in the six works are both mundane and supermundane: in work 1, the removal of sins; in works 1 and 2, the attainment of accomplishments (<em>siddhi</em>, i.e., supernatural power or superhuman experience); in 4, the attainment of firm meditation that never diminishes; in 6, the achievement of all aims such as pacifying, prospering, and so on. Works 3 and 5 do not mention fruits. According to Abhayākaragupta, a fruit of the practice in work 3 is perfection of “supreme bliss,” which indicates some level of experience of nondual reality in the form of bliss.</p>
<p>The practice of oblation can be explained as follows: Offering oblations to deities who reside in various places in the universe can be considered the core element of the external ritual form of fire oblation. The fire god Agni consumes external offered articles and transmits them to deities residing in heavens. Oblation to deities takes the form of oblation to the practitioner himself (i.e., self-oblation) in systems of psychosomatic fire oblation. This does not mean that deities residing in various places in the universe cease to be the recipients of these oblations. Recipient deities are ultimately contained within a practitioner: they are idealized as being within the practitioner’s meditational expansion or meditative absorption. Concepts used in the six works that frame one’s existence in this way are the mind-<em>vajra</em> (or the mind-king), the body <em>maṇḍala</em> (or the circle of channels), and/or Vajrasattva (or his other form, Saṃvara). The yogic subtle fire, which is the inner Agni, consumes internally offered articles and transmits them to the practitioner, who contains the recipient deities within himself.</p>
<p>The practice of nonconceptual meditation can be explained as follows: Various concepts, such as “the five aggregates,” of which a practitioner conceives are the firewood and fuel. The yogic subtle fire, which is the inner Agni, burns up and disintegrates this fuel. A practitioner renounces his erroneous attachment to concepts by means of meditation on the yogic subtle fire. The yogic subtle fire is called “the fire of gnosis” (or the like) in this aspect of psychosomatic fire oblation because of its function of disintegrating concepts. It can be inferred that one’s inclusive self described earlier is realized with the help of nonconceptual meditation on the yogic subtle fire in works 1, 2, and 3, in which the practices of oblation and nonconceptual meditation are combined.</p>

<h2 id="notes-7">NOTES</h2>
<p>Problems in Bentor’s study (pp. 596–601) can be summarized as follows: First, I use as the main materials in my essay the following texts: (1) the <em>Mahāmudrātilaka-tantra</em>, (2) the <em>Vajramālā-tantra</em>, (3) the <em>Saṃpuṭodbhava-tantra</em>, (4) the <em>Vajraḍāka-tantra</em>, (5) the <em>Ḍākārṇava-tantra</em>, and (6) Jayasena’s <em>Ḍākārṇavahomavidhi</em>. The fundamental reason for Bentor’s study being insufficient is that she used only Tibetan translations of texts 1 and 4. Second, important elements that form structures of Buddhist systems of psychosomatic fire oblation are the practice of oblation, nonconceptual meditation, and subtle-body yoga, as I discuss in this essay. Bentor did not clarify these structures, as she did not develop a category of inner fire oblation that I call “psychosomatic fire oblation,” which is a major type of inner fire oblation both in Buddhism and non-Buddhist traditions in South Asia, as mentioned earlier. Finally, Bentor regarded types I and II of her typology as being similar to, or having nearly the same significance as, the third initiation and the yoga of perfection process (<em>utpanna</em>-/ <em>niṣpanna-krama</em>), respectively. While these two types are indeed similar in the respects that type II and the third initiation are forms of sexual yoga and that type I and the yoga of perfection process are forms of subtle-body yoga (as is also examined in this essay), we must also carefully consider the significance of their being taught as different practices in the tantras.</p>

<p>Both texts (TTP: Tohoku and Otani) read <em>baṃ</em>, but the original may be <em>aṃ</em> (the letter AṂ). In esoteric Buddhism the fusion of the letters HŪṂ (blue color, male) and AṂ (red color, female) signifies the union of male and female, which represents the real. If this fusion occurs in all the inner hearths, they all represent the real, which makes this fire oblation practice more excellent. The letter VAṂ, however, generally symbolizes male. It may be that the letter VAṂ colored in red symbolizes female in this context.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
