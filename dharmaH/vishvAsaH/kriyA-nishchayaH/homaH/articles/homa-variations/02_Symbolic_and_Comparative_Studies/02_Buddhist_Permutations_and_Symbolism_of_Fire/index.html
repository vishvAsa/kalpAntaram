THIS ESSAY OFFERS an unpretentious survey of the conceptual and yogic permutations of fire and is based on a selection of Vedic and Buddhist sources. Part One provides an overview of the Vedic perceptions of fire and fire sacrifices, and is intended to serve as a background scenario to the Buddhist interpretations of fire. Part Two ascertains the Buddhist reinterpretation of the Vedic fires and sacrifices, and sketches the Buddhist assimilation of the god Agni and homa rituals. Part Three explores the Buddhist expositions of the fire element (tejodhātu) and wisdom fire (jñāna-agni). These two categories of fire are not discussed in isolation, but their respective expositions are integrated into the relevant doctrines and practices. The fire element is treated as part of the Abhidharma cosmology, and as part of the mundane path (laukika-mārga), while wisdom fire is treated as part of the supramundane path (lokottara-mārga).">

<p>THIS ESSAY OFFERS an unpretentious survey of the conceptual and yogic permutations of fire and is based on a selection of Vedic and Buddhist sources. Part One provides an overview of the Vedic perceptions of fire and fire sacrifices, and is intended to serve as a background scenario to the Buddhist interpretations of fire. Part Two ascertains the Buddhist reinterpretation of the Vedic fires and sacrifices, and sketches the Buddhist assimilation of the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rituals. Part Three explores the Buddhist expositions of the fire element (<em>tejodhātu</em>) and wisdom fire (<em>jñāna-agni</em>). These two categories of fire are not discussed in isolation, but their respective expositions are integrated into the relevant doctrines and practices. The fire element is treated as part of the Abhidharma cosmology, and as part of the mundane path (<em>laukika-mārga</em>), while wisdom fire is treated as part of the supramundane path (<em>lokottara-mārga</em>).</p>
<h2 id="part-one-fire-and-fire-sacrifices-in-brahmanic-sources">PART ONE FIRE AND FIRE SACRIFICES IN BRAHMANIC SOURCES</h2>
<p>As a natural phenomenon, and as the god Agni, fire occupies a prominent position in the Vedic hymns and cognate sources. In all such sources, the expositions of natural fire and the god Agni do not form a body of coherent and systematic teachings, but represent a diverse variety of opinions and speculations. Due to this complex variety, the ensuing presentation gathers together only a selection of the most prominent opinions and theories of fire, which are pertinent to the understanding of the subsequent reinterpretation and treatment of fire in Buddhist sources.</p>
<h3 id="the-origin-and-character-of-fire">The Origin and Character of Fire</h3>
<p>In the Vedic hymns, the god Agni is only second to Indra and is invoked in some 200 of the 1,028 hymns of the <em>Ṛgveda</em>. As a personification of fire, Agni is inherently linked with the fire element and is attributed a number of figurative and anthropomorphic forms. The origin of natural fire, or the god Agni, is not limited to one single source or agency, but is identified with a number of natural phenomena, or is attributed to some of the Vedic gods.</p>
<p>According to various myths and speculations, Agni’s progenitors are Dyaus (Sky) and Pṛthivī (Earth), or Tvaṣṭṛ (Creator) and Āpas (Waters), or he is the “son of the Waters” alone (Apāṃ-napāt). He is also born from the atmospheric lightning and the sun, or from the woods and plants. Then again, he is born in the sky and descends as lightning, or he is the sun and fire. Finally, fire is simply produced by rubbing together two friction sticks (<em>araṇī</em>).1</p>
<p>Agni is said to represent or to be all the gods, because it is in and through Agni that sacrificial offerings are presented to all the gods.2 Agni is also identified with the supreme Brahman and the Vedic sacrifice.3 It is said in the <em>Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa</em> that Agni has eight forms: he is Rudra, Sarva, Paśupati, Ugra, Aśani, Bhava, Mahān Deva, and Īśana.4 In the <em>tantras</em> he also has eight different forms, five of which are Vahni, Anala, Pāvaka, Hutāśa, and Vaiśvānara.5 As Vaiśvānara (Common-to-all-men, Universal, or Omnipresent), Agni is identified with the fire that abides in all men and digests food.6</p>
<p>Agni is said to be eternal and omnipresent, old and yet forever youthful, fertile, and life-giving. He is called the “shining thunder which is in heaven” and is also invoked as the sage “who has the voice of the wind, the neighing of the cloud, and who takes the celestial waters for his clothing.”7</p>
<p>Having sketched the diverse origins and broad characteristics of fire in its natural and personified forms, we now proceed to explore some of its specific guises, properties, and functions. Essentially, the Vedic sources do not make clear distinctions between the natural and personified forms of fire and other phenomena. In effect, all phenomena, and celestial bodies such as the sun and the moon, are mostly treated as deities. Thus, in this paper, the fire is predominantly cast in its personified forms in the majority of its configurations.</p>
<h3 id="the-god-agni-as-priest-and-sage">The God Agni as Priest and Sage</h3>
<p>When he blazes in the sacrificial fires, the god Agni primarily functions as the sacerdotal intermediary between the Vedic gods and men. He officiates at every sacrifice and conveys offerings to the gods, or he brings the gods down to earth to partake in the prepared oblations. In the <em>Ṛgveda</em> he is called the high priest (<em>purohita</em>) of the gods.8 In some passages the sun is also compared to a brilliant fire, kindled and honored with offerings, and is called, as Agni, the priest of the gods.9 Agni is also attributed several other priestly titles,10 and as the domestic fire he is said to be the householder (<em>gṛhapati</em>).11 As the householder’s fire, Agni is also referred to as the friend in the homes of men, or again as father, brother, or son, and as the master of the house. He is the immortal who abides among the mortals in human habitations.12 Agni is also the role model for the earthly priests who perform sacrifices, and as he is ascribed several priestly titles, in effect he epitomizes all the functions of Brahmanic priests. In the sacrificial context, three forms of Agni are distinguished in the <em>Yajurveda</em>: the eater of raw flesh, the eater of corpses, and the sacrificial priest.13</p>
<p>Along with his priestly status, Agni’s second major attribute is the possession of knowledge and wisdom. He is described as knowing (or known by) all beings (<em>jātavedas</em>), as omniscient (<em>viśvavid</em>), and as being endowed with all wisdom and sciences. The Vedic sages admit that Agni is superior in wisdom to all pious men, and that as such he is the most pious among all sages (<em>ṛṣi</em>).14 As the high priest, Agni does not make mistakes, but if he does he knows how to correct them, because he is wise and all-knowing.15 In one Vedic hymn we read: “Let Agni complete the worship. Let him fix rites and seasons. When we most ignorant neglect the statutes of you, O deities with whom is knowledge, wise Agni shall correct our faults and failings, skilled to assign to each god his fitting seasons.”16 In another Vedic hymn it is said that Agni, through his wisdom, gave existence to all men.17</p>
<p>It seems that Agni’s wisdom largely stems from his cosmic omnipresence, and from his acquaintance with the intricate mechanism of the Vedic sacrifices. Since he conveys the sacrifices to all the gods, dwells within and with all men, and pervades all things, he sees and knows them all. Similarly, as the high priest he presides over and knows the innate dynamics of Vedic rituals. Some other aspects of Agni’s wisdom will emerge in subsequent sections.</p>
<h3 id="doctrine-of-the-five-fires">Doctrine of the Five Fires</h3>
<p>The doctrine of the five fires (<em>pañcāgni-vidyā</em>)18 essentially expounds the origin of human beings from the gods and immortality. In the <em>Upaniṣads</em>, these five fires are described as five consecutive oblations (<em>āhuti</em>), which generate five specific results. The fruit of the first oblation is offered in the second oblation. Then the fruit of the second oblation is offered in the third oblation, and so on. These five oblations are performed within the tripartite structure of the Vedic cosmos: the first in the world of the gods, the second in the intermediate region, and the remaining three on the earth. Their descriptions are poetic and yet realistic, and are indicative of the cosmos-oriented speculations of the Vedic sages, and indeed of their visionary and perspicacious minds. In the <em>Chāndogya</em> and <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣads</em> the five fires as oblations are depicted in the following manner.</p>
<p>Fire (<em>agni</em>) is the yonder world: the sun (<em>āditya</em>) is its firewood, the sunrays its smoke, the day its flame (<em>arcis</em>), the moon (<em>candramas</em>) its embers, and the constellations (<em>nakṣatra</em>) its sparks (<em>visphuliṅga</em>). In this fire the gods offer faith (<em>śraddhā</em>),19 and from this oblation arises King Soma. (1)</p>
<p>Fire is the rain-cloud (<em>parjanya</em>): the wind is its firewood, the thundercloud (<em>abhra</em>) its smoke, the lightning (<em>vidyut</em>) its flame, the thunder (<em>aśani</em>) its embers, and the hailstones its sparks. In this fire the gods offer King Soma, and from this oblation springs rain. (2)</p>
<p>Fire is the earth (<em>pṛthivī</em>): the year is its firewood, space (<em>ākāśa</em>) its smoke, the night its flame, the four quarters its embers, and the intermediate quarters its sparks. In this fire the gods offer the libation of rain, and from this oblation springs food (<em>anna</em>). (3)</p>
<p>Fire is a man (<em>puruṣa</em>): speech is his firewood, breath his smoke, the tongue his flame, the sight his embers, and the hearing his sparks. In this fire the gods offer food, and from this oblation issues the seminal fluid (<em>retas</em>). (4)</p>
<p>Fire is a woman (<em>yoṣā</em>): the genitals are her firewood, the solicitation her smoke, the vagina her flame, the inner activity her embers, and pleasure her sparks. In this fire the gods offer the seminal fluid, and from this oblation issues an embryo (<em>garbha</em>, or a man, <em>puruṣa</em>).20 (5)</p>
<p>In the above named <em>Upaniṣads</em> the five fires are correlated with the theory of the two paths, which lead to two distinct destinations: one irreversible path leading to immortality and union with Brahman, and one circular path leading to repeated rebirths.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Chāndogya</em>, after the completion of the fifth oblation as described above, the embryo remains inside the womb for nine or ten months, and then it is born. Once born, a man lives his allotted duration of life, and after becoming a departed spirit (<em>preta</em>), he is carried back to the same fire from which he emerged and arose.21 In the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em>, we find an insightful elaboration. When a man dies he is committed to the funeral fire. His fire is the fire itself: the firewood is the firewood, the smoke is the smoke, the flame is the flame, the embers are the embers, and the sparks are the sparks. In this fire the gods offer a man, and from this oblation arises a man of luminous hue (<em>bhāsvara</em>-<em>varṇa</em>).22</p>
<p>Next is described the post-mortem journey of those who follow the irreversible path or the path of the gods. Those who know the above five fires, and those in the forest who venerate faith as truth (<em>satya</em>), pass into the funeral flame (<em>arcis</em>). Then, in succession they progress into the day, the waxing moon, the six months during which the sun moves toward the north, the world of the gods, the sun, and into the region of lightning (<em>vaidyuta</em>). A person consisting of mind comes to that region, and then leads them to the worlds of Brahman (<em>brahmaloka</em>). They dwell in those worlds for long periods, and essentially for them there is no return (<em>āvṛtti</em>).23</p>
<p>The circular path, or the path of the fathers, is followed by those who win the worlds by means of sacrifices (<em>yajña</em>), offerings (<em>dāna</em>), and austerities (<em>tapas</em>). When they die they pass into the cremation smoke, and then in succession they progress into the night, the waning moon, the six months during which the sun moves toward the south, the world of the fathers (<em>pitṛloka</em>), and the moon. On reaching the moon they become food and the gods feed on them. When this feeding period concludes for them, they diffuse into space, and then pass into the wind, next into the rain, and finally into the earth. Upon reaching the earth they become food.24 Next they are sacrificed once more as food in the fire of man (<em>puruṣāgni</em>), and then they are born in the fire of woman (<em>yoṣāgni</em>). Rising up in the worlds, they circulate again in the same way.25</p>
<p>Finally, it is emphatically stated that when a man duly knows the five fires, he is not stained by evil (<em>pāpman</em>). Indeed, once he knows such matters, he becomes pure and cleansed, and obtains an auspicious world (<em>puṇya</em>-<em>loka</em>).26</p>
<p>According to the <em>Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad</em>, the moon is the gateway to the celestial worlds (<em>svargaloka</em>). This text asserts that after death all departed people proceed to the moon. Then the moon questions them about their identity. Those who give wrong answers diffuse into rain, shower down to earth, and are born in conformity with their deeds and knowledge. Those who give the correct answer advance to the world of Agni, and then passing through several other worlds, they arrive in the world of Brahman. When Brahman asks: “Who are you?” One should reply: “I am the seasons (<em>ṛtu</em>) and I am the offspring of the seasons. I was born from the womb of space as the seminal fluid for the wife, as the radiance (<em>tejas</em>) of the year, as the self (<em>ātman</em>) of every being. You are the self of every being. I am what you are.” Brahman asks: “Who am I?” One should reply: “The truth/real (<em>satyam</em>).” Brahman asks: “What is the truth/real?” One replies: “<em>Sat</em> is whatever is different from the gods and the breaths, and <em>tyam</em> denotes the gods and the breaths. All this is encapsulated in the word <em>satyam</em>, all this is the totality of this world. You are this entire world.”27 Thus, it is the knowledge of one’s origin and nature, and of one’s identity with Brahman that is the prerequisite for reaching the final destination.</p>
<p>In conclusion to this section three significant points can be noted. First, when combined with the path of the gods, the doctrine of the five fires depicts how human beings are born from the gods, and how they return to the world of the gods through the path of fire or light. In the first instance, the five fires as oblations emulate the cosmic process leading to the birth of human beings from the gods. In the second instance, there is a reverse process of returning to the gods and immortality. This process starts with the entry into the funeral flame, then progresses through the different levels of the cosmos, and finally terminates in the highest world. This return path is largely demarcated as different forms of fire. Thus, it is the fire as light that serves as the link between the gods and men, and as the return path to the world of the gods. The second path is circular and devoid of fire or light. It starts with the entry into the funeral smoke and concludes with rebirth here on earth.</p>
<p>Second, in the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> and <em>Chāndogya</em>, the two paths start in the funeral pyre and have distinctly different appearances. The path of the gods consists of light, and the path of rebirth is smoky, dark, and rainy. In the <em>Kauṣītaki</em>, the two paths seem to be partly the same and partly different. The path between the funeral pyre and the moon is the same for all the departed. As already discussed, all departed go to the moon, and then depending on their answers, some enter the path of the gods, and others are showered back to this earth. Thus, the separation into two paths takes place on the moon.</p>
<p>Third, the possession of knowledge about the five fires, and about one’s origin and identity with Brahman is a mandatory requirement for entry onto the path of light, and for the attainment of union with Brahman. It may also be added that in the <em>Upaniṣads</em> the possession of knowledge as a condition for the attainment of union with Brahman is frequently reiterated.</p>
<h3 id="the-three-sacrificial-fires">The Three Sacrificial Fires</h3>
<p>The three sacrificial fires (<em>tetrāgni</em>) essentially serve as the hearths for the performance of sacrifices, and for making offerings to the gods through the medium of the god Agni. Their names are: oblational fire (<em>āhavanīya</em>), southern fire (<em>dakṣiṇāgni</em> or <em>anvāhārya</em>-<em>pacana</em>), and householder’s fire (<em>gārhapatya</em>).</p>
<p>Of these three fires, the oblational fire is square and positioned toward the east of the householder’s fire. It is used as the principal fire in the majority of <em>Śrauta</em> sacrifices. The southern fire is shaped like a half-moon or semi-circle and is positioned toward the south. It serves to make offerings to the fathers and is also used for placating and averting evil spirits. The householder’s fire is circular in shape and is positioned toward the west. It serves to make offerings twice a day, at sunrise and at sunset. Out of the three fires, the texts recommend that the householder’s fire should be kindled at all times, and that this fire should be used to ignite the other two fires whenever required.28</p>
<p>Although the above three fires are built on this earth, their ritual significance and function are not confined to this earth, but are endowed with cosmic significance and correspondence in the wider universe. Since their interpretations are complex and lengthy, we only indicate their correspondences to the three Vedic worlds. According to the relevant sources, the oblational fire is the sky or the world of the gods, the southern fire is the intermediate region or the world of the fathers, and the householder’s fire is this world, the world of men.29 Thus, the sacrifices performed in these three fires are conceived as cosmic events and transactions between the world of the gods and the world of men. Some other configurations and correspondences are discussed in the relevant passages of the next and latter sections.</p>
<h3 id="fire-and-brahman">Fire and Brahman</h3>
<p>Broadly speaking, in the <em>Upaniṣads</em> the term “Brahman” denotes the impersonal and immortal principle, and the first cause of the universe. Brahman is the ultimate reality, which is separate from and yet immanent in the living world. As the ultimate reality, it is also called <em>ātman</em>, and it is asserted to be identical with the deathless essence of the human being, also called <em>ātman</em> (the self). The supreme Brahman is imperceptible and formless, and yet since it created this world and suffused itself into it, it is assumed to embrace the totality of phenomena as parts of itself. In the <em>Upaniṣads</em> a number of prominent phenomena are said to be Brahman or different parts of its cosmic body. Brahman is said to be the self, the mind, the vital breaths, and many other things, but at the same time it is maintained that ultimately there is only one Brahman. Generally speaking, the identification of Brahman with fire and light is rather prominent in the <em>Upaniṣads</em>. Out of all such identifications, we present here three representative configurations.</p>
<p>In the <em>Chāndogya</em> we find a group of six specific phenomena: Sky, Sun, Wind, Space, Water, and Earth, which in some sources are considered to be forms of fire or light. However, in this group at least one of them, the sun, is definitely a category of fire. In the first instance these six phenomena are styled as specific forms of the universal <em>ātman</em> and are individually identified by six different householders as their ultimate <em>ātman</em>.30 Next, it is explained that individually these six forms do not represent the whole or totality of the universal <em>ātman</em>, but only different parts of its body. Thus, the sky is the head, the sun is the eye, the wind is the breath, the space is the body, the water is the bladder, and the earth is the feet. The text then goes on to say that the sacrificial platform (<em>vedi</em>) is the chest, the sacrificial grass is the bodily hair, the householder’s fire is the heart, the southern fire is the mind, and the oblational fire is the mouth.31</p>
<p>While in the <em>Chāndogya</em>, the sun and the three sacrificial fires are identified with the bodily parts of the universal <em>ātman</em>, the <em>Kaṭha</em> and <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣads</em>32 project a variant correlation between Brahman and the different forms of fire. These two texts postulate that the sun, moon, stars, lightning, and earthly fire do not shine of their own accord. It is only when Brahman shines that everything else shines after it, and the entire world radiates with its light (<em>bhās</em>). In the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</em>, it is explicitly stated that Brahman is the light (<em>jyotis</em>) of lights, and that this is what the visionaries of the Self perceive.</p>
<p>In the <em>Maitrī Upaniṣad,</em> Brahman is said to be the luminous form (<em>bhāsvara-rūpa</em>) which blazes in the sun, the bright light (<em>jyotis</em>) in the smokeless fire (<em>agni</em>), and the fire in the stomach which digests the food. The unity of these three forms of fire is confirmed by the following citation: “The one who is in the fire (<em>agni</em>), the one who is in the heart, and the one who is in the sun (<em>āditya</em>), he is one. He who knows this goes to the oneness of the One.”33</p>
<p>It is fairly apparent from the above three configurations that Brahman is identified with practically all forms of fire and light. Since Brahman is also identified with other cosmic phenomena, its identification with fire and light is not exclusive, but as already mentioned it is markedly prominent.</p>
<h3 id="fire-death-and-immortality">Fire, Death, and Immortality</h3>
<p>In relation to death and immortality, the fire is attributed three major capacities: death, embodiment or bestowment of immortality, and immortality itself. In the Vedic context, the term “death” denotes a bondage, understood as repeated deaths of the body. In relation to this bondage of repeated death, the term “immortality” denotes a lasting freedom from death. The self as such is immortal, but while it is tied up with the body, it is mortal, since it experiences the dying process as a separation from the body. In this context, as death, the fire in the capacity of the life breath exits or abandons the body. As death, the fire has no power over the immortal self. However, as an embodiment of immortality, the fire bestows or enables the mortal self to gain the condition or realm of immortality as freedom from death. As for the fire as immortality, the actual condition of the immortal self or the realm of immortality is often depicted as radiant and luminous forms of fire.</p>
<p>The Vedic thinkers agree that the body is mortal and the self is immortal. They also agree that death has to be overcome by winning immortality as freedom from death. However, they have different opinions about the post-mortem process, and about the specific configurations of death and immortality.</p>
<p>We begin with some of the opinions on the process after the self separates from the body at the moment of death. We are concerned here with the post-mortem journey in the case of those who do not return to this earth, but advance to their final goal. In addition to the path of the gods described above in the section on the five fires, we present here four representative opinions.</p>
<p>The first opinion maintains that when the self rises from the body, it reaches the supreme light (<em>jyotis</em>) and emerges in its proper form (<em>svarūpa</em>). This form is said to be the supreme person (<em>puruṣa</em>), who roams about and enjoys himself, without remembering the body.34</p>
<p>According to the second opinion, when a man dies, his speech dissolves into the fire, his breath into the wind, his sight into the sun, his mind into the moon, his hearing into the quarters, his self into space, and his body into the earth.35</p>
<p>The third opinion also maintains that when a person departs from this world, his vital functions dissolve into their respective counterparts in the cosmos. However, this opinion further maintains that being composed of these cosmic counterparts, a person chooses to become one of them as a deity and remains at peace.36</p>
<p>Finally, the fourth opinion postulates that at the moment of dying the self fades away, and the vital breaths gather around it. Taking into itself these particles of light, the self descends into the heart. Then the tip of the heart lights up, and with this light (<em>pradyota</em>) the self departs through the eye or the head. Being free from desires, the self is Brahman and goes to Brahman. Thus, a mortal becomes immortal and attains Brahman in this world. The body lies dead, but the bodiless and immortal life breath is Brahman; it is light (<em>tejas</em>).37</p>
<p>Although ultimately the final goal of the Upaniṣadic sages is to reach the final union with Brahman, it is evident from the above opinions that the specific pattern of the post-mortem journey and the final destination are described in variant ways. However, setting aside their differences, these four opinions have one common characteristic: the use of light imagery to epitomize the post-mortem journey and state. Whether the self and the vital breaths dissolve into their cosmic counterparts, or whether they dissolve into one single entity, both the process of their dissolution and their final state are described as forms of light.</p>
<p>Next we briefly glance at some images of fire as death in personified and impersonal forms. In one laconic passage, death as the god Mṛtyu is explicitly identified with the god Agni, and the entire world is said to be his food.38 In another account, Mṛtyu first generates for himself two bodies: one threefold body consisting of fire, sun, and wind, and one body in the form of speech. Then with these two bodies he creates the entire world and begins to eat everything he created.39 Then again in one account in which <em>ātman</em> creates a man and endows him with the vital functions, Agni becomes speech, and Mṛtyu becomes the <em>apāna</em> breath and enters the body at the navel.40 Death is also said to be the earth,41 the householder’s fire,42 and a form of weariness that captures and attenuates the vital functions.43</p>
<p>Next we inspect a number of selected accounts, which depict the boundaries and polarities between death and immortality, the ways of gaining the immortal state, and the actual character of immortality.</p>
<p>In some accounts, the boundary between death and immortality is demarcated in the form of two sacrificial fires, one built on the earth and one built in the world above. In one account we learn that the mystic significance of the sacrificial fire is speech because it is built with the speech of the three Vedas. As the three Vedas, the speech is threefold and so is the sacrificial fire built with that Vedic triad. The body of the fire is also threefold, and it is with this threefold body that the threefold immortality is gained. Next, we learn that this speech is the yonder sun, and this fire Agni is death. All things on this side of the sun are held by death. When one builds the sacrificial fire on this side of the sun, one builds it as the fire held by death, and one surrenders oneself to death. On the other hand, when one builds it in the world above, one overcomes repeated death, because when the fire is built with knowledge it is built in the world above. As the three Vedas, the triple speech is the sun’s orb, the sun’s light, and the man in the sun. The immortal element, the shining light, corresponds to the lotus leaf deposited on the sacrificial fire. It is on that immortal element that one builds for oneself the body consisting of the three Vedas, and one becomes immortal.44</p>
<p>In one account, death and immortality are contrasted as darkness and light. In this particular account, the patron of a <em>soma</em> sacrifice is instructed to recite the following three Vedic lines as a supplication for immortality: “From the unreal (<em>asat</em>) lead me to the real (<em>sat</em>). From darkness (<em>tamas</em>) lead me to light (<em>jyotis</em>). From death lead me to immortality.” Next it is explained that the unreal is death and the real is immortality, and that darkness is death and light is immortality.45</p>
<p>Next we recount the famous story in which the god Mṛtyu himself teaches Naciketas how to escape death. Being granted three wishes, as his second wish Naciketas requests Mṛtyu to reveal the fire that leads to the celestial world, in which people have no fear of death and partake of immortality (<em>amṛtatva</em>). In response Mṛtyu states that this kind of fire abides hidden in the heart’s cavity. Next, he explains that the fire is the beginning of the world, and then describes it as a fire made of bricks. The full details of this fire are not given; it is only indicated that Mṛtyu specifies the type of bricks, their number and arrangement, and then names that fire after Naciketas. Although the innate character of this fire is not fully disclosed, it is certain that Mṛtyu explained it as a sacrificial fire. This is evident from the concluding statement, which says that by kindling a triple Naciketas fire, and performing the triple work,46 one crosses over birth and death. Knowing Brahman as the god to be venerated, and realizing him, one gains everlasting peace.47 Thus, although in this account the Naciketas fire serves as an escape from death, it is not explicitly stated whether it has the character of immortality.</p>
<p>Apart from the Naciketas story, there are other stories and statements about the capacity of the sacrificial fire to bestow immortality. For instance, it is said in the <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> that when the benefactor constructs the sacrificial fire, he overcomes repeated death. This is the case, because when one constructs the sacrificial fire, one becomes the god Agni who is the immortal element.48 Another passage in the same text says that the fire is the immortal element of the sacrifice, because it has the nature of the sun. In the context of the body, it is the life breath that is the body’s immortal element, because it has the nature of fire.49 In yet another section of the same text, a story is told of how the gods gained immortality through the performance of the fire sacrifice. Initially, the essence of immortality escapes from the gods. On becoming mortals, the gods set out in search of immortality. They perform a series of austerities and discover the immortal <em>soma</em>. Next, they press the <em>soma</em> and offer it in the fire, and thereby bestow immortality on Agni. Since Agni as the sacrificial fire is the body of all the gods, once the gods bestowed immortality on Agni, they also bestowed it on themselves. Then it is further explained that if one seeks after immortality, one should emulate the above sacrifice of the gods. When one offers the <em>soma</em> in the fire, one bestows immortality on Agni and on oneself, because the sacrificial fire is one’s divine body, while one’s actual body is merely one’s human body.50</p>
<p>In the <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em>, there are two verses which disclose the mystic or yogic property of fire. These verses succinctly state that mist, sun, wind, lightning, or moon are the preliminary appearances that produce the full emergence of Brahman in yogic practice. Once the earth, water, fire, wind, and space arise in conjunction, and once the quality of yoga emerges and has the nature of these five elements, there is no sickness, no old age, and no death for one who has obtained the body made of the fire of yoga (<em>yogāgni</em>).51</p>
<p>In one account we learn how the five vital functions became freed from death, and then became cosmic phenomena. Initially it is stated that the vital breath as a deity is called Ayāsya, because it is the essence of the limbs. Next it is said that the same deity is also called Dur, because death keeps away from it. Then it is further elaborated that this deity drove out the evil death from the other deities and carried them beyond the reach of death. Once freed from death, speech becomes fire, the breath (breathing) becomes the wind, the sight becomes the sun, the hearing becomes the quarters, and the mind becomes the moon.52</p>
<p>Now we come to the account in which the sun is identified as the final destination and abode of immortality. This account begins with Prajāpati producing matter and life breath for the purpose of creating many beings. The life breath is identified with the sun, and matter with the moon. Next, the sun’s properties are explained. When the sun rises and illuminates all quarters of the world, it collects all vital breaths into its rays. In fact when the sun rises, it emerges as Vaiśvānara Agni having the form of life breath and fire. Then the text quotes a Vedic verse, which encapsulates the nature of the sun: “The one having all forms, the golden one, the all-knowing one, the final goal, the only light, the heat-giver, the thousand-rayed one, the hundredfold orbiter. Thus rises the sun (<em>sūrya</em>), the life breath of the created beings.” Next are outlined the two paths, which are variations of the two paths described in the section on the five fires. Prajāpati (as the year) follows two pathways: the southern and the northern. The people who perform sacrifices and meritorious deeds, win only the lunar world, and then return to the earth. This is the path of the fathers, and it is matter. By contrast, those who seek the Self through austerities, chastity, faith, and knowledge, follow the northern path and win the sun (<em>āditya</em>). This is the resting-place of the life breaths: it is immortality, freedom from fear, and the final goal. From there they do not return: it is their final resting place (<em>nirodha</em>).53</p>
<p>Finally, in one account we learn that Death is immortal. According to this account, the sun’s shining orb is the <em>Ṛg</em>-verses, the glowing light is the <em>Sāman</em>-tunes, and the man in the sun’s orb is the sacrificial fire as the <em>Yajur</em>-formulas. These are the three worlds, the triple (Vedic) lore that shines. The man in the sun’s orb is Death (Mṛtyu), and the glowing light is the immortal element, however, Death does not die, because he is within the immortal. Then the following verse is quoted and explained: “Immortality is within Death, it is founded on Death, Death puts on the radiant one.” Immortality is within death because it is beneath death, and it is founded on death because the immortal shines being established on the man in the sun. Death puts on the radiant one, namely the sun, because death is enveloped by the sun on all sides. Death’s self is inside the radiant one, because the body of that man is inside the sun’s orb.54</p>
<p>The above presented opinions and stories about fire as death and immortality reflect the various pathways of the Vedic speculations, but they cannot be readily molded together into a coherent and conclusive exposition or theory of death and immortality. However, it is evident that fire in its different hues is prominently employed to epitomize the innate dynamics of death and immortality, the two great mysteries of mankind.</p>
<h3 id="the-character-and-scope-of-vedic-sacrifices">The Character and Scope of Vedic Sacrifices</h3>
<p>The terms <em>yajña</em> (translated as sacrifice) and <em>karma</em> (translated as deeds, works, or ritual activities) denote the whole gamut of Vedic rituals, which function as transactions between the gods and men. The majority of such rituals share one common feature, namely the use of fire to make offerings to the gods. In its simplest configuration the fire is kindled and venerated with offerings and Vedic hymns.55 Conceptually the sacrifice is perceived as an apparatus or power, which efficiently maintains the cosmic harmony, vitality, and prosperity, and it is also expressive of the reciprocal interactions between the higher and lower levels of existence. Men duly perform their ritual duties, namely the sacrifices, while the gods play their respective role by channeling prosperity down to this earth. However, although the sacrifice is conceived as a kind of transaction, the actual rewards or results of the sacrifice are not bestowed by the gods, but are derived from the innate power and efficacy of the sacrifice itself. Like the Vedas, the sacrifice is asserted to exist from eternity, and the creation of the world is also seen as a result of the sacrifice performed by the supreme being.56 The efficacy of the sacrifice is largely attributed to the faultless execution of the ritual components, which as a whole constitute the kernel of the sacrifice’s mechanism. Although the gods are invoked and gratified with offerings, they do not discharge the sacrificial benefits, but function as instruments or channels through which the sacrificial effects are conveyed. The sacrifice is superior to the gods, and possesses a kind of mystical potency, which invariably produces its expected results.57</p>
<p>According to the <em>Śrauta</em> texts, the sacrifices basically require the three sacrificial fires that are described above. The ordinary householders maintain the householder’s fire, in which they perform the ritual duties on behalf of their households. As already mentioned, they are obliged to perform the fire offerings (<em>agnihotra</em>)58 twice a day, at sunrise and at sunset. These daily fire offerings are presented to the gods and with them to all beings. More prosperous people maintain a set of all three fires, and a number of priests to carry out the rituals as prescribed in the texts, or for particular intentions and purposes. The tangible differences between the sacrificial rituals are largely seen as the matter of ritual elaborations and the quantity of offerings.59</p>
<p>The sacrificial offerings normally include agricultural products, such as milk, butter, barley, rice, and cakes (<em>bali</em>). The texts also prescribe animal sacrifices,60 and the <em>Brāhmaṇas</em> specify a list of five sacrificial victims: man, horse, ox, sheep, and goat. Wild animals, fish, birds, and pigs, are excluded. The animals are suffocated or strangled, and are then ritually dissected into specified portions and presented in the fire as offerings.61</p>
<p>The purpose of the offerings to the gods is to feed them and to gain favors. The benefits of the sacrifices accrue to the patron or benefactor (<em>yajamāna</em>) and not to the performing priests. In the <em>Ṛgveda</em> the benefactor who supplies the offerings is promised the mundane wealth and prosperity in return for the sacrifice and the gifts to the priests. The gods are said to be pleased with the poor people who give small amounts of offerings, but they are annoyed with the rich people who are stingy. It is said that “the theory of the sacrifice and its result as an exchange of gifts, of strength for strength, is the fundamental fact of the whole Vedic religion.”62 It is also said that the essential part of sacrifices is abandonment (<em>tyāga</em>). The sacrificial oblations are presented as offerings and serve as symbolic substitutes for the benefactor who, as it were, abandons and offers himself.63 The abandoned offerings are transformed by the sacrifice into the nourishment for the gods. Agni, as fire, is the mouth of the gods, and the offerings dispensed into the fire ascend to the celestial sphere and are absorbed through a kind of inhaling. The remainder of the offerings is consumed by the benefactor and the priests.</p>
<p>The <em>Śatapatha-Brāhmaṇa</em> distinguishes two kinds of gods: gods who are truly gods, and human gods who are learned <em>brāhmaṇas</em> versed in the sacred texts. The sacrifice offered to them is also twofold: sacrificial oblations offered to the true gods, and gifts or fees (<em>dakṣiṇā</em>) offered to the human gods. When these two kinds of gods are gratified, they convey the benefactor to the celestial world. The same text specifies four major categories of gifts: gold, cows, garments, and horses.64</p>
<p>The <em>Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa</em> also sets forth the classical grouping of sacrifices into five great sacrificial sessions (<em>mahāsattra</em>):</p>
<p>Thus, as a whole, these five sacrifices discharge offerings and gratify all categories of beings in all three Vedic worlds.</p>
<p>In conclusion, three conceptual features of the Vedic sacrifices should be noted here, as they had some impact on Buddhist ideas. First, the sacrifice is a ritualistic transaction that is endowed with an inherent efficacy. The basic idea is that the ritual activity itself produces the result or repayment, without the intervention of the gods or the priests. Second, the sacrificial offerings are treated as gifts or acts of abandonment. Third, the reward derived from the sacrifices accrues to the benefactor who is the donor of the sacrificial offerings, but not to the priests. These three prominent features of the Vedic sacrifices had an influence on the formulation of the Buddhist theory of generosity as a substitute of Vedic sacrifices, as discussed in Part Two.</p>
<h3 id="internal-fire-sacrifice">Internal Fire Sacrifice</h3>
<p>Over the course of time, the Vedic sacrifices have been progressively reinterpreted and transposed into new visions of religious thought and practice. As such, they are not discarded as totally ineffective, but at the same time their conceptual and functional configurations are modified in two major ways. First, as such the Vedic sacrifices and the practice of good works largely retain their status, but their overall efficacy is attenuated and diminished, and the superiority of knowledge is emphasized as the primary expedient of gaining the ultimate liberation or union with Brahman. Second, the Vedic sacrifices originally performed as external rituals are ingeniously reformulated into internal fire oblations performed within the body.</p>
<p>The efficacy and superiority of knowledge over that of ritual activities is clearly evident in the theory of the two paths described above in the sections on the five fires, and on fire, death, and immortality. In addition, we indicate here a few of the many <em>Upaniṣadic</em> statements, which emphasize the superiority of knowledge. It is said in the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em> that the world of men is gained only through a son, but not through other works. The world of the fathers is gained through the ritual activities, and the world of the gods is gained through knowledge. The world of the gods is the best, and it is for this reason that knowledge is praised.66 Then again it is said in the same <em>Upaniṣad</em>67 that when a man does not know the imperishable (<em>akṣara</em>), and performs sacrifices and austerities in this world for thousands of years, his works come to an end. When such a man departs from this world without knowing the imperishable, he is to be pitied. By contrast, the man who leaves this world after gaining the knowledge of the imperishable, he is a <em>brāhmaṇa</em>. In the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</em>, it is said that those who know Brahman distinguish two types of knowledge (<em>vidyā</em>): the lower and the higher. The lower knowledge includes the four Vedas, ritual science, grammar, etymology, and astrology. The higher knowledge is that through which one realizes the imperishable.68 The same <em>Upaniṣad</em> also states that the sacred knowledge, or the knowledge of Brahman (<em>brahma-vidyā</em>), is the foundation of all knowledge (<em>sarvajñāna</em>).69</p>
<p>The internal fire sacrifice is considered to be a recast of the Vedic fire sacrifice (<em>agnihotra</em>) as briefly described above and is designated by two principal Sanskrit names: <em>āntara-agnihotra</em> and <em>prāṇāgnihotra</em>. The term <em>āntara-agnihotra</em> is normally translated as the internal fire sacrifice, while <em>prāṇāgnihotra</em> is translated as the fire sacrifice to the breaths, or as the sacrifice in the fires which are the breaths.70 Essentially, the internal sacrifice consists of a ritualized partaking of food, and offering it as oblations to the vital breaths within the body. In the paragraphs that now follow, we first sketch the cosmography of the body and its correspondence to the outer cosmos, and then we ascertain several accounts of the internal fire sacrifice.</p>
<p>We already know that the term <em>ātman</em> denotes the deathless essence of the human being, and that it is identical with the ultimate <em>ātman</em> or Brahman. However, in the <em>Upaniṣads</em> this term is also employed with reference to the body as a living or breathing entity. This living self consists of the deathless self and the physical body. The deathless self is hidden within the heart’s cavity and is endowed with certain powers through which it functions and animates the body. These powers are called breaths or vital breaths (<em>prāṇa</em>) and are also referred to as deities (<em>devatā</em>). There are five such breaths which circulate within the body.71 The term <em>prāṇa</em> has two meanings: it is one of the five breaths, and it denotes the life breath. As one of the five breaths, it is frequently translated as breathing out or as the in-breath. As the life breath, it denotes the totality of the five breaths and is identical with the self and with the cosmic self, the sun.72 Apart from the above five breaths, there is another group of five powers, which are jointly called the vital functions (<em>karma</em>) and are also referred to as deities or vital breaths. They are: speech, sight, hearing, breath, and mind (thinking).73 The self is also said to consist of speech, mind, and breath.74 Then again it is further identified with the five great elements, namely earth, wind, space, water, and light.75 Finally, according to one account, the self is made of the mind, the vital breaths are its body (<em>śarīra</em>), light (<em>bhā</em>) is its appearance, truth is its determination, and space is its essence (<em>ātman</em>). It contains all actions, all desires, all smells, and all tastes. This self within the heart is smaller than a grain of rice or barley, and yet it is larger than the earth, larger than the sky, larger than all the worlds put together. It is Brahman.76</p>
<p>The five vital breaths are said to be fires, and in one account their identification as fires is depicted in the following way. When a person is asleep, everything converges within the mind, the supreme deity. In this condition, a person does not perceive or hear anything, but the fires of the vital breaths (<em>prāṇāgni</em>) keep awake within the body. The householder’s fire is the <em>apāna</em> breath, the southern fire is the <em>vyāna</em> breath, and the oblational fire is the <em>prāṇa</em> breath. The <em>samāna</em> breath balances the two oblations (<em>āhuti</em>), namely breathing in and breathing out; they are explained later on. The mind is the benefactor (<em>yajamāna</em>), and the fruit of the sacrifice is the <em>udāna</em> breath, which day-by-day leads the benefactor to Brahman.77</p>
<p>Next, we identify some of the correlations between the living self and the outer cosmos. In addition to the correlations already given in the sections on the five and three fires, and in the section on fire, death, and immortality, there are three representative opinions.</p>
<p>The first opinion correlates the five vital breaths to the five vital functions and to the phenomena in the outer cosmos. According to this opinion, the five vital breaths are located in the heart, and they are called the five openings for the gods (<em>devasuṣaya</em>). The heart’s eastern opening is the <em>prāṇa</em> breath, it is sight, and the sun. Its southern opening is the <em>vyāna</em> breath, it is hearing, and the moon. Its western opening is the <em>apāna</em> breath, it is speech, and the fire. Its northern opening is the <em>samāna</em> breath, it is the mind, and the rain. Its upper opening is the <em>udāna</em> breath, it is the wind, and space. Finally, these five openings are also called the five men of Brahman, and the five doorkeepers of the celestial world (<em>svargaloka</em>).78</p>
<p>Apart from the correlations given in the above paragraph, in some sources the five vital functions are related to the outer phenomena in the following ways: speech is the fire, breath is the wind, sight is the sun, hearing is the quarters, and mind is the moon.79</p>
<p>In one account, the character and correlation of the self as speech, mind, and breath are explained in the following way. The mind includes all mental activities such as desire, determination, doubt, faith, shame, intellection, and fear. Speech includes all categories of sound, and the breath includes the five vital breaths. In relation to the three worlds, speech is this world, mind is the intermediate world, and breath is the upper world. They are also the three Vedas: speech is the <em>Ṛgveda</em>, mind is the <em>Yajurveda</em>, and breath is the <em>Sāmaveda</em>. Then again, speech is the gods, mind is the fathers, and breath is the humans. Once more, whatever is known is the form of speech, for speech is the knower. Whatever is to be known is the form of mind, because the mind is to be known. Whatever is unknown is the form of breath, because the breath is unknown. Finally, the earth is the body of speech, and the fire is its luminous form. The sky is the body of the mind, and the sun is its luminous form. The water is the body of the breath, and the moon is its luminous form.80</p>
<p>As the sacrificial offerings discharged into fire largely consist of food articles, and form the essential component of fire sacrifices, it seems pertinent to glance at some of the <em>Upaniṣadic</em> opinions on food. We recapitulate here three such opinions, which reflect some of the pivotal <em>Upaniṣadic</em> perceptions of food as the kernel of the body and the vital breaths. These opinions also contribute to the understanding of the internal fire sacrifice as a ritual feeding of the vital breaths as deities.</p>
<p>According to the first opinion, when solid food, water, and fire are absorbed, each of them becomes refined into three grades. In the case of food, the coarsest becomes faeces, the medium becomes flesh, and the finest becomes the mind. In the case of water, the coarsest becomes urine, the medium becomes blood, and the finest becomes breath. In the case of fire, the coarsest becomes bones, the medium becomes marrow, and the finest becomes speech. Thus, the mind consists of food, the breath of water, and the speech of fire.81</p>
<p>The second opinion postulates that food is the highest form of <em>ātman</em>, because the life breath consists of food. If one does not eat, one is unable to think, see, hear, or feel, and one forfeits one’s vital breaths. When one eats, one’s vital breaths prosper and one can think, see, hear, and so forth. The sun takes food by way of its rays and generates heat. When supplied with food the vital breaths digest it, and the fire also blazes with food. This world is said to have been fashioned by Brahman with an appetite for food. Thus, one should venerate food as the self.82</p>
<p>According to the third opinion, all creatures that live on the earth are born from food, live on food, and in the end they pass into food. Food is the eldest of beings (<em>bhūta</em>), and hence it is called the panacea of everything. Those who venerate Brahman as food, obtain all kinds of food. Creatures come into being from food, and they grow by food; food is eaten and it eats beings.83</p>
<p>Having sketched the innate composition of the living self and its homologies with the outer cosmos, we now ascertain several accounts of the internal fire sacrifice. These accounts are arranged more or less in a chronological sequence, which broadly reflects the progressive evolution of this sacrifice.</p>
<p>The first account depicts the cosmic sacrifice performed by the fire and the sun. Normally, this sacrifice is not classed as an internal sacrifice, but we include it here, because it has some conceptual affinities to the sacrifice consisting of breathing in and breathing out, and to the fire sacrifice explained in the <em>Maitrī Upaniṣad</em>. According to some sources, the sun is the cause of evil committed during the day, and the fire is the cause of evil done during the night. For the sake of being able to sustain creatures, the sun and the fire make a pact to offer themselves to each other. Thus, when the sun offers itself to the fire at sunset, all evil done in the day is eliminated by the fire during the night, and when the fire offers itself to the sun at sunrise, all evil done at night is erased by the sun during the day. Similarly, when one offers the evening oblation to the fire, during the night the fire drives away one’s evil done during the day, and when one offers the morning oblation to the sun, during the day the sun drives away one’s evil done during the night.84</p>
<p>The seminal formulation of the internal sacrifice is encapsulated in a short passage of the <em>Bṛhadāraṇyaka</em>. Here it is stated that the sun rises from the life breath and sets into it, and that the deities declared this phenomenon as the Law (Dharma). Next, it is recommended that a man should undertake one single observance. He should breathe in and breathe out while wishing: “May evil death never seize me.” He should persevere in this observance to the end, and thus win the union with that deity, namely the breath.85</p>
<p>Next, we recount the five fire oblations, which are offered to gratify the five vital breaths, and their cosmic counterparts. It is said in the <em>Chāndogya</em> that when one takes food, the first morsels should be offered in sacrifice (<em>homīya</em>). The first oblation (<em>āhuti</em>) is offered to the <em>prāṇa</em> breath with the words: “to the in-breath <em>svāhā</em>.” Once this breath is satisfied, the sight, the sun, and the sky are satisfied. Next, one offers oblations to the remaining breaths while reciting their invocations. The second oblation is offered to the <em>vyāna</em> breath, and once this breath is satisfied, the hearing, the moon, and the quarters are satisfied. The third oblation is offered to the <em>apāna</em> breath, and when this breath is satisfied, the speech, the fire, and the earth are satisfied. The fourth oblation is offered to the <em>samāna</em> breath, and when this breath is satisfied, the mind, the rain, and the lightning are satisfied. The fifth oblation is offered to the <em>udāna</em> breath, and when this breath is satisfied, the skin, the wind, and space are satisfied. Finally, it is said that when the five breaths and their counterparts are satisfied, one also gains a sense of satisfaction, possesses children, cattle, food, splendor, and eminence in sacred knowledge (<em>brahma-varcas</em>).86 Then, in another passage it is said that when one is not knowledgeable, and performs the daily fire sacrifice, one’s performance is similar to the removal of the live embers and throwing the offerings onto the ashes. However, when one knows these things, and one offers the daily fire sacrifice, one’s sacrifice is offered in all the worlds, all the beings, and all the selves. When one has knowledge and offers the fire sacrifice, one’s wickedness becomes burned like stalks of grass cast into fire.87</p>
<p>The <em>Kauṣītakī Upaniṣad</em> elaborates on the observance of breathing in and breathing out as briefly described in the <em>Bṛhadāṛaṇyaka</em>. This text says that when one speaks one cannot breathe, and when one breathes one cannot speak. When one speaks one offers breath in speech, and when one breathes one offers speech in breath. These two functions are said to be the two endless and deathless oblations (<em>āhuti</em>), which are offered without interruption, whether one is awake or asleep. All other oblations are said to have an end, because they consist of ritual activities.88</p>
<p>Finally, we recount the internal fire sacrifice as described in the <em>Maitrī Upaniṣad</em>. This account opens with a statement that, knowing the life breath and the sun as one’s self, one meditates and sacrifices within the self. One cleanses the impurity of one’s mind with an appropriate <em>mantra</em> and supplicates the purifying power of Fire and Sun to cleanse one’s food. Next one recites salutations to the five vital breaths, offers food oblations, and then partakes of the food. Having sacrificed to <em>ātman</em>, one meditates on it as breath and fire, and as being All. Finally one recites the following verses: “As breath and fire, the supreme <em>ātman</em> has entered in with the five winds (<em>vāyu</em>). Being content himself, may he content all, the all-enjoyer. You are All, you are Vaiśvānara (Agni). Everything that is born, is supported by you. May all oblations enter into you. The creatures live where you are, the all-immortal.” Finally, it is said that when one eats in conformity with the above exposition, one does not come into the condition of food. One does not become food, and hence one is not reborn.89</p>
<p>The crystalized exposition of the internal fire sacrifice is given in the <em>Prāṇāgnihotra Upaniṣad</em>, but we content ourselves with the above accounts, as they are adequate to understand the basic notion of this sacrifice.</p>
<p>Except for the sacrifice of breathing in and breathing out, the internal fire sacrifice essentially consists of a ritualized manner of eating food, understood as the process of feeding and gratifying the vital breaths. Since bodily and mental vitality is maintained by nourishment, the offerings of food in oneself strengthen and gratify the vital breaths, and by extension their cosmic counterparts as well. The internal sacrifice does contain a meditative element, which focuses on the significance of the vital breaths as the self, but it is not exclusively an internally meditative process. However, as a whole it is a considerable advancement on the externally performed fire sacrifices.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-part-one">Conclusion (Part One)</h3>
<p>At the end of this exploration of fire in Brahmanic sources, the principal features of fire can be encapsulated in its cosmic, mystical, and ritual configurations.</p>
<p>In terms of its cosmic configuration, the fire constitutes the natural energy which pervades, invigorates, and maintains the life and vitality of the entire cosmos. As the sun, the fire is the largest resource of energy, diffusing itself into all beings and phenomena. As we have seen, among many of its configurations, the fire is identified as the life breaths. It is also identified with death, but in this capacity, it destroys only the body and all other material things. As death and life breath, the fire is the immortal force, which maintains the vitality, purity, and continuity of the entire cosmos.</p>
<p>In its mystical configuration, the fire is identified with the supreme Brahman, and with the deathless self of human beings. It is the luminous and formless hue of the fire that is the perceptible appearance of Brahman and the self. Although Brahman is ultimately imperceptible and formless, its cosmic and mystical appearance is identified with light or luminosity. The fire is also endowed with yogic properties, in the sense that the mind emerges as light, or perhaps as luminous knowledge in the yogic visions of Brahman.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of its ritual capacity, the centrality of fire in Vedic sacrifices is abundantly evident in its identity and function as the god Agni. As the sacrificial priest, Agni embodies all the gods and serves as the expedient of immortality. In effect, Agni constitutes the vitality and efficacy of the Vedic sacrifices.</p>
<h2 id="part-two-buddhist-reinterpretation-and-assimilation-of-vedic-fire-and-sacrifices">PART TWO BUDDHIST REINTERPRETATION AND ASSIMILATION OF VEDIC FIRE AND SACRIFICES</h2>
<p>When the Buddha won the supreme enlightenment under the <em>bodhi</em> tree, he gained an intuitive insight into the true nature of all beings and phenomena, and discovered a new destiny for mankind. His mystic realization of the true nature of existence, no doubt, provided sound foundations for the formulation of his teachings. However, it took a fair amount of time before the Buddhist teachings were crystallized and adapted to the religious and cultural milieu of ancient India. Initially, the Buddha rejects the Vedic values, in particular, the kernel of the Vedic religion: the self and the fire sacrifices. His rejection of bloody sacrifices is firm and uncompromising, but of course a mere rejection is not adequate to counteract opponents or to attract followers. The Buddha was aware that he had to mold and adapt his teachings to the ethical, philosophical, and social configurations of his time. To this extent he revaluates the existing philosophies and practices, and formulates a body of Buddhist teachings and values in conformity with his enlightened vision of existence and human destiny. The Buddha’s critique, reformulation, and assimilation of the Vedic values are evident in the ways in which he and subsequently his followers recast and assimilate the constructive aspects of the Vedic fires and sacrifices. The second part of this essay consists of three sections: Buddhist reinterpretation of Vedic fires and sacrifices, Buddhist similes of fire, and Buddhist assimilation of the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rituals.</p>
<h3 id="buddhist-reinterpretation-of-vedic-fires-and-sacrifices">Buddhist Reinterpretation of Vedic Fires and Sacrifices</h3>
<p>The Buddha’s critique of Vedic sacrifices is largely articulated on ethical grounds. He rejects all bloody sacrifices as being cruel and unethical, and undermines them as being ineffective and fruitless. Similarly, in terms of their reinterpretation, he reformulates and redirects their ethical values into the practice of generosity.</p>
<p>In a number of his discourses the Buddha condemns all sacrifices in which cows, goats, sheep, and other animals are slaughtered. He argues that the horse and other bloody sacrifices are rooted in cruelty and bring little results. He further points out that the sacrifices that involve butchery are not frequented by his monks or by the sages who follow the path of emancipation.90 He also condemns the performance of different kinds of <em>homa</em> as wrong expedients of earning livelihood.91 Furthermore, he attacks and criticizes the conduct and motivations of the Brahmins who perform sacrifices. The Brahmins praise and perform sacrifices to the gods, but essentially they yearn for sensual pleasures and depend upon material gains. They are addicted to sacrifices, but ultimately the performance of sacrifices does not enable them to succeed in overcoming birth and old age.92</p>
<p>The Buddha also criticizes the Brahmins for their decadence and failure to live in conformity with the Brahmanic legacy (<em>dhamma</em>) of the ancient Brahmins. In one of his discourses he tells an assembly of Brahmins that the ancient Brahmins lived in self-restraint and were ascetics. They had no cattle, no gold, and no wealth. They had study as their grain and wealth, guarded the holy life as their treasure, and praised morality, austerity, and nonviolence. They performed sacrifices consisting of rice, barley, and oil, but they did not kill the cows. However, eventually things have changed. The Brahmins saw the wealth and prosperity of the king, his cows and women, and they coveted his riches. They composed hymns and induced the king to sacrifice his wealth. The king consented, sponsored sacrifices, and bestowed wealth on the Brahmins. Once they received wealth, the Brahmins became overcome by greed and craved for more. This time, they induced the king to sacrifice his cows. The king complied and had thousands of cows killed in sacrifices. When the cows were slaughtered, the gods and forefathers protested against their slaughter as being against the Law (<em>adhamma</em>). The Buddha concludes his discourse by stating that the slaughter of innocent animals is unlawful and that those who perform bloody sacrifices deviate from the true Dhamma.93</p>
<p>Although the Buddha rejects all bloody sacrifices, he affirms the sacrifices at which no animals or any other living beings are killed. For instance, he praises the bloodless oblations, which are offered for the welfare of the clansmen (<em>pitṛyajña</em>).94 In one of his discourses, he explains that when a sacrifice is performed and animals are slaughtered, and when the participants have wrong views and wrong intentions, then that sacrifice brings no great fruit or profit. On the other hand, a sacrifice at which no animals are slaughtered, and the participants have right views and right intentions, that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit.95 Then again, in some discourses the Buddha says that in his previous existences he was a royal priest (<em>purohita</em>) and performed sacrifices. However, he always performed or advised the king to sponsor bloodless sacrifices that brought wealth and prosperity.96</p>
<p>As already indicated above, the Buddha’s reinterpretation of the Vedic sacrifices largely consists in recasting their ethical ideology into the practice of generosity. The Buddha employs the term “sacrifice” (<em>yajña</em>), but he imbues it with Buddhist values, and essentially interprets it as the practice of generosity (<em>dāna</em>). In one of his discourses, he tells his listeners that one should give offerings (<em>havya</em>) to the person who is tamed by truth, possesses knowledge, and emulates the true mendicant life. The Brahmin who seeks merit (<em>puñña</em>) should sacrifice to such a person. One should sacrifice to those who abandon sensual pleasures and live homeless lives, and to those who are liberated from sense-pleasures (<em>vītarāga</em>). The Buddha also presents himself as the supreme field of merit (<em>puññakkheta</em>). Being free from sensual pleasures, knowing the end of birth and death, and being possessed of wisdom, the Tathāgata is worthy of the sacrificial cake (<em>pūraḷāsa</em>) and is the field for the one who is looking for merit. In fact, he is the supreme field of merit and the worthy recipient of the sacrifice of the entire world.97</p>
<p>The Buddhist reinterpretation of the Vedic sacrifices into the practice of generosity is formulated along the following line of argumentation. Like the Vedic sacrifices, the practice of generosity involves three things: the benefactor or donor, the gift or offerings, and the recipient of the gift. Instead of sponsoring the Vedic sacrifices, the Brahmins and other people are now solicited to acquire their merit through donations to the <em>saṅgha</em> and mendicants. The acquisition of merit as repayment for donations is automatic, and it accrues to their donors in the same way as the benefits derived from the sacrifices accrue to their sponsors. The volume of merit is calculated to be proportionate to the volume and value of donations, and to the status of their recipients. The Vedic gods who were venerated with oblations, and the Brahmins who received cows and other gifts, are now replaced by the Saṅgha and mendicants as the more worthy recipients of alms and gifts, because of their impeccable conduct and spiritual qualities. The Buddha never prevents his followers from giving to non-Buddhist mendicants, but he does grade the Saṅgha and himself as being more worthy recipients and also as reciprocating more merit.98</p>
<p>In addition to his reinterpretation of the Vedic sacrifices into the practice of generosity, the Buddha also transmutes them into the Buddhist way of life. In one of his discourses, he lists in ascending order a series of more fruitful and profitable sacrifices than the Vedic sacrifices. He begins with the practice of generosity. Regular donations to virtuous mendicants constitute a more fruitful sacrifice. The reason is that the Buddha’s disciples and those on the path to liberation do not attend bloody sacrifices, but only the sacrifices at which gifts are given. If anyone provides shelter for the Saṅgha, that constitutes a more profitable sacrifice. Then again, if anyone with a pure mind takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, that constitutes a higher sacrifice than the previous sacrifices. Next, if anyone sincerely undertakes to observe the five precepts, he performs an even greater sacrifice. Then the Buddha continues to explain the consecutive stages of Buddhist practices that eventually culminate in the sacrifice that consists in the attainment of <em>arhatship</em> and deliverance. He concludes his discourse by stating that this is a sacrifice that is simpler, less troublesome, more fruitful and profitable than all other sacrifices. In fact, there is no other sacrifice that is greater or more perfect.99</p>
<p>The Buddha’s reinterpretation of the three Vedic fires is given in one of his discourses in which he explains a set of seven fires: three fires to be abandoned, three fires to be respected, and one fire to be made use of.</p>
<p>The fires of greed, hatred, and delusion are to be abandoned. The Buddha explains that when one’s mind is inflamed and obsessed by these three fires, one embarks on the course of wrong conduct in body, speech, and mind. As a consequence of these three evil ways of conduct, after death one is reborn in evil destinies.</p>
<p>Next the Buddha praises the three fires that should be venerated and respected: the fire worthy of oblations, the fire of the householder, and the fire worthy of gifts.100 The fire worthy of oblations denotes one’s parents whom one should respect and look after, because they are the progenitors of one’s life. The householder’s fire stands for the householder’s wife, children, and servants. The fire worthy of gifts denotes the mendicants who refrain from indolence and tame their minds, and who are thus worthy of respect and offerings. The seventh fire is the ordinary wood-fire, which is kindled, tended, and extinguished from time to time, whenever it is required.101</p>
<p>The Pāli names of the three fires that should be venerated are essentially the same as the Sanskrit names of the three Vedic fires described in Part One. However, here their English renderings are modified in order to reflect their Buddhist reinterpretations. Buddhaghosa says that the Brahmins perform fire sacrifices, because they believe that they bring great fruit. But if offerings are sacrificed to gain great fruit, then surely the Saṅgha should be sacrificed to, because indeed the things sacrificed to the Saṅgha do bring great fruit.102 Finally, the higher reward from respecting holy people than from performing fire sacrifices is neatly asserted in one verse of the <em>Dhammapada</em>: “A man may tend the sacred fire [<em>aggi</em>] in the forest for one hundred years. Yet if he honors a perfected person just for one moment, that honor is indeed better than the fire-sacrifice [<em>huta</em>] for one hundred years.”103</p>
<p>It is evident from the above discussion of the Buddhist reinterpretation of Vedic fires and sacrifices that the Buddha invested much effort and ingenuity to eliminate the slaughter of animals and to inspire superior ways of ethical and religious conduct that are highly beneficial to those who embrace them. He also redirected the charitable deeds to a better cause, namely to the Saṅgha and mendicants as epitomes of perfect conduct and religious life.</p>
<h3 id="buddhist-similes-of-fire">Buddhist Similes of Fire</h3>
<p>The Buddhist similes or metaphors of fire are not limited to the reinterpretation of the three Vedic fires, but they also include specifically Buddhist images. Generally speaking, the Buddhist imageries of fire largely emulate the natural qualities of fire to depict the positive or negative propensities and qualities of human character and conduct. In this section is recounted a modest selection of metaphoric configurations of fire, which aptly reflect the Buddhist ethical and intellectual values.</p>
<p>The adverse and detrimental force of fire is employed to epitomize the three principal vices: greed, hatred, and delusion. In his third sermon, generally known as “The Fire Sermon,” the Buddha says that the sense faculties and their respective objects are inflamed with the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion. In addition, the Buddha also mentions other fires, such as the fire of birth, decay and death, sorrow and grief, and lamentation and despair.104 In one text, the above three fires are explained in the following ways: the fire of greed burns those inflamed with greed, the fire of hatred burns the malevolent people who take life, and the fire of delusion burns those who are confused and untrained in the noble Dhamma. The people ignorant of these three fires suffer in the three evil destinies. By contrast, those who apply themselves to the teachings of the Buddha, they quench the fire of greed through awareness of the foul things, extinguish the fire of hatred through goodwill, and eliminate the fire of delusion through the penetrating insight into the truths. It is through knowledge that they eliminate rebirths and reach the state of non-becoming.105 It is said in the <em>Milindapañha</em> that one should realize the supreme bliss of <em>nirvāṇa</em>, in which the blazing heat of the threefold fire (<em>tividhaggi</em>) has been completely extinguished. One should regard the three fires as a furnace, and <em>nirvāṇa</em> as fireless space (<em>niraggikokāsa</em>).106 Then again the <em>Dhammapada</em> says that there is no fire equal to greed, no evil quality equal to hatred, and no suffering equal to the five aggregates.107 In the Pāli and other sources, the above three fires are predominantly referred to as the three roots of evil (<em>akuśalamūla</em>),108 and in some sources they are also referred to as the three poisons (<em>triviṣa</em>). Some Buddhist scholars say that these three fires are metaphoric reinterpretations of the three Vedic fires, but they do not indicate any canonical sources that make explicit connections between these two sets of fire. Since the three Vedic fires are recast in a positive way, it seems rather odd that they should be interpreted in two incongruous ways.</p>
<p>In the <em>Milindapañha</em>, we find a fivefold comparison between the natural qualities of fire and the ascetic life of a yogi. Just as fire burns grass and other things, in the same way the zestful yogi should burn his defilements with the fire of wisdom (<em>ñāṇaggi</em>). Just as fire has no pity or mercy, in the same way the yogi should have no compassion for all moral defilements. Just as fire destroys cold, in the same way the yogi should set ablaze the fire of energy (<em>viriya-santāpa-aggi</em>) and burn all defilements. Just as fire gives heat without partiality and repugnance, in the same way the yogi should abide in his mind, remaining free from partiality and repugnance. Finally, just as fire dispels darkness and generates light, in the same way the yogi should dispel the darkness of ignorance and make appear the light of wisdom (<em>ñāṇāloka</em>).109</p>
<p>In the <em>Paṭisambhidāmagga</em>, we find a different set of five fires: fire of virtuous conduct, fire of good qualities, fire of understanding, fire of merit, and fire of true ideas. These five fires, respectively, counteract the following fires: fire of bad conduct, fire of adverse qualities, fire of non-understanding, fire of demerit, and fire of untrue ideas.110</p>
<p>Some other metaphors of fire and its doctrinal configurations are discussed in Part Three.</p>
<h3 id="buddhist-assimilation-of-the-god-agni-and-homa-rituals"><em>Buddhist Assimilation of the God Agni and</em> Homa <em>Rituals</em></h3>
<p>In the Pāli canon, the Buddha deprives the Vedic gods of their immortality by subjecting them to the law of karma, which means that they are engulfed in the bondage of birth and death like all other beings.111 Since he is free from karma and rebirth, the Buddha asserts his superiority over all the gods, but he recognizes their superiority over human and other beings. He does not prohibit his followers to interact and respect the indigenous gods in return for mundane favors, although he warns them that the gods are of no help in gaining the state of liberation.</p>
<p>In general, the Buddha’s encounter and interaction with the Vedic gods are good-natured and positive. The gods are present at all the major events of his life, mainly as witnesses of his great deeds performed for the sake of all beings. They are present at his birth, request him to set in motion the wheel of the Dharma,112 and gather to witness his final demise.113 It is said in some texts that when the Buddha preached his first sermon, it was heard as high as the Brahmā abode.114 It is also said that whenever the Buddha taught, the sound of the Dharma penetrated as high as the Brahmā gods, and that at the time of his enlightenment, the gods transmitted the news as high as the abodes of the Śuddhāvāsikas.115 Among all the gods it is Māra, the lord of death, who is the only adversary of the Buddha at different stages of his life. There are some occasions when the Buddha criticizes or even intimidates the gods. One such example is the Buddha’s visit to the Brahmā Baka, whom he tells that he is steep in ignorance and rebukes him for holding the wrong view of permanency.116 However, apart from Māra and some confrontational encounters, the Vedic gods are well-disposed toward the Buddha and prominently figure in his life and discourses. This situation, of course, enhances the Buddha’s status and authority, and demonstrates to all strata of the Indian society that their gods approve of the Buddha.</p>
<p>The various groups of gods recorded in the Pāli canon include the Vedic gods, such as Indra, Brahmā, the four guardians of the world, and the Thirty-three gods.117 In the Abhidharma works, these groups of gods are adapted and integrated into the structure of the three worlds (<em>traidhātuka</em>). The four guardians and the Thirty-three gods are included among the six groups of the Kāmadevas in the Kāmadhātu, and the higher gods, such as the different groups of Brahmās, are included in the Rūpadhātu.118 In the wheel of life (<em>bhavacakra</em>), all the gods are classed together as one category of beings and are included in the happy destiny of the gods.</p>
<p>Although the Vedic gods are present in the canonical discourses and are integrated into the Abhidharma cosmos, the god Agni is conspicuously missing in the canonical and Abhidharma sources. As such, he is not included in any of the known lists of the Vedic gods. As discussed above, the Buddha reinterprets the Vedic fires and sacrifices, but he says practically nothing about the god Agni. He does not condemn Agni as a god, but he as it were completely disregards him. There are references in the Pāli canon to fire <em>homa</em>, to building a fire hearth and tending the fire, and also to fire worshippers (<em>jaṭila</em>),119 but it is not clear whether they refer to the god Agni. However, four Vedic epithets of the god Agni are mentioned but not explained in the Pāli sources: Pāvaka, Kaṇhavattani, Jātaveda, and Hutāsana.120 In some <em>Jātakas</em> there are stories about a deity called Aggibhagavā (the lord of the fire), who is also referred to as Aggideva and Jātaveda. The worship of this deity was rewarded with a rebirth in the <em>brahma</em> world. It is said that on the day a son was born, a birth fire (<em>jātaggi</em>) was kindled, and when the son reached adulthood and decided to renounce his household life, this fire was carried to the forest and homage was paid to Aggibhagavā.121 Thus, apart from the passing references to his epithets and to Aggibhagavā, we found no explicit references to the god Agni in the Pāli sources.</p>
<p>It took centuries before the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rites tangibly emerge in the Buddhist <em>tantras</em>. In this category of texts, the Vedic pantheon, including Agni, is fully incorporated into the <em>tantric</em> pantheon. The various groups of the Vedic gods are classed as mundane deities (<em>laukika</em>) and are assigned the function of attendant and protective deities.</p>
<p>In the <em>tantras,</em> the god Agni performs two major functions: he serves as one of the ten guardians of the world (<em>lokapāla</em>), and he consumes the oblations offered in <em>homa</em> rituals.</p>
<p>Among the <em>tantras</em>, perhaps the <em>Mañjūśrīmūlakalpa</em> is the first text that describes the god Agni and a fire rite. In this work, Agni is referred to as the king of the gods and is described in conjunction with fire oblations.122 In the <em>Mahā-Vairocana-Abhisaṃbodhi</em>, the Buddha explains and sanctions a whole range of fires and <em>homa</em> rites. In this work, he tells Vajrapāṇi that in one of his previous existences, he taught the ethical instructions contained in the heretical scriptures, such as the abstention from killing creatures, apart from doing so as offerings (<em>bali</em>) to the gods. He also taught about the Vedic Agni in order to reduce the volume of animal slaughter among the heretics. He further explains that as a Bodhisattva, he instructed the great Brahmā about the genealogy of forty-four Vedic fires. Out of them the first one was Abhimānin Agni who arose in the Brahmaloka at the start of the first aeon. Next there followed his descendants, starting with the mundane fire called Pāvaka. The names of the remaining descendents include Vaiśvānara, Maruta, Sūrya, Yojika, Agni, Brahmā, Yama, and Jaṭhara. Upon becoming enlightened, the Buddha taught twelve kinds of fire, so that the transcendental <em>homa</em> could be performed. The first fire is the fire of wisdom and it is called Mahendra. He bestows fine features, enrichment and strength, and perfects wisdom. The names and functions of the remaining fires are not fully articulated. Some names such as Mṛda, Kṣaya, Manoja, and Mohana appear to be inventions, and some names such as Jaṭhara are clearly Vedic.123</p>
<p>As one of the ten guardians, Agni is positioned in the south-eastern quarter. Allowing for some variations, his basic iconography is largely the same in all <em>maṇḍalas</em>. He is seated on a goat, wears the sacred thread (<em>yajñopavīta</em>), and his hair is matted or in flames. He has two or four hands, in which he holds a water pot, a rosary, a club, and one or both of the two sacrificial ladles. The color of his body is normally red, but it can also be white or yellow.124</p>
<p>In peaceful <em>homa</em> rites, the iconic forms of Agni are benign, and in fierce <em>homas</em> they are wrathful. In his simplest form, he sits on a goat or an antelope and holds a rosary and a water pot. In some forms he has three faces and four hands. With one hand he makes the gesture of fearlessness, and in the remaining three hands he holds a rosary, a water pot, and a club. In some <em>homa</em> rites he is represented with his consort.125</p>
<p>In the four principal <em>homa</em> rites of pacification, prosperity, subjugation, and destruction, the fire god is normally called Agni. However, in a number of <em>homa</em> rites that are performed on special occasions, Agni is given different names. In one <em>homa</em> rite that aims to generate in beings the mental dispositions of kindness and happiness, and to bring prosperity and freedom from diseases, he is called Mahendra. This is the same god whom the Buddha lists as the fire of wisdom and the source of prosperity. In one peaceful rite, he is called Vahni and is said to epitomize the knowledge of suchness (<em>tathatā</em>). In one <em>homa</em> that aims to make people happy, he is called Kāma Agni. Then in a rite for increasing wealth, he is called Lohita Agni. In a <em>homa</em> aiming to delight the deities, he is called Amṛta Agni. On the occasion of knotting the hands of the deities prior to their instalment inside a newly built monastery, he is called Yojaka Agni and is respected with the ceremony performed on the occasion of marriage. Finally, in one fierce <em>homa</em>, he is called Marutānala, and in one funeral <em>homa</em>, he is called Sāvaka and is accompanied by his consort.126 This completes our discussion of the assimilation, iconic forms, and different names of the god Agni.</p>
<p>Since the incipient <em>tantric</em> compositions, which predate the emergence of the mature <em>tantra</em> texts, have not been fully explored, it is impossible to sketch here the progressive stages of the assimilation of <em>homa</em> rites into Buddhism. However, generally speaking, it is really in the <em>tantras</em> and their commentaries that we find full descriptions of <em>homa</em> rites,127 although the <em>tantras</em> do not shed any concrete information on the historical or textual origins of <em>homa</em> rites. As we have seen above, in the <em>Mahā-Vairocana</em>-<em>Abhisaṃbodhi</em>, the Buddha is credited with the approval and assimilation of the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rites. However, the Buddha’s statement in this <em>tantra</em> merely serves as a doctrinal justification for the assimilation of <em>homa</em> rites, but it is not a tangibly historical datum.</p>
<p>In the paragraphs that now follow, we mainly discuss the names and designs of the <em>homa</em> hearths. First, we compare the <em>homa</em> hearths with the Vedic fires. Second, we compare the designs of the four <em>homa</em> hearths with the shapes of the four mythical continents. Third, we recount Abhayākaragupta’s survey of the <em>homa</em> rites and the designs of their hearths. Finally, we sketch the performance of the transcendent or internal <em>homa</em>.</p>
<p>As textual or other evidence is not readily available, it is difficult to establish whether the Buddhist <em>homa</em> hearths derive from or have direct connections with the three Vedic fires. However, we are able to indicate the resemblances between their shapes.</p>
<p>As we have seen in Part One, the three Vedic fires have different shapes and epitomize or correspond to the three Vedic worlds. The oblational fire is square and denotes the world of the gods. The southern fire is semicircular and denotes the world of the fathers, and the householder’s fire is round and denotes this world. In terms of directions, they are respectively positioned to the east, south, and west.</p>
<p>According to Abhayākaragupta, the Indian tantric master of around the eleventh century, out of the four principal <em>homa</em> hearths, the peaceful hearth is round in shape, white in color, and positioned to the east of the <em>maṇḍala</em>. The enriching hearth is square in shape, yellow in color, and positioned to the south. The subduing hearth is shaped like a half-moon, red in color, and positioned toward the west. Finally, the fierce hearth is triangular in shape, dark blue or black in color, and positioned to the north of the <em>maṇḍala</em>.128 In some sources the directional positions of the hearths are different. For instance according to the <em>Saṃpuṭa-tantra</em>, the peaceful hearth is to the east, the fierce hearth to the south, the subduing hearth to the west, and the enriching hearth to the north.129</p>
<p>When we compare the shapes, the round hearth of the peaceful <em>homa</em> corresponds to the shape of the householder’s fire, the square hearth of the enriching <em>homa</em> corresponds to the oblational fire, and the semicircular hearth of the subduing <em>homa</em> corresponds to the southern fire. The triangular hearth of the fierce <em>homa</em> has no correspondence. However, since the southern fire serves to feed the fathers and to avert evil spirits, perhaps in Buddhism it is divided into the subduing, or pacifying and fierce <em>homa</em> hearths. The directions of the <em>homa</em> hearths do not match the directions of their corresponding Vedic fires.</p>
<p>In terms of shapes, the four <em>homa</em> hearths and the four mythical continents of the Buddhist cosmos have the following resemblances. The eastern continent Pūrvavideha is shaped like a half moon and corresponds to the semicircular hearth of the subduing <em>homa</em>. The western continent Aparagodānīya is shaped like a full moon and corresponds to the round hearth of the peaceful <em>homa</em>. The southern continent Jambudvīpa is shaped like a chariot with three sides and corresponds to the triangular hearth of the fierce <em>homa</em>. Finally, the northern continent Uttarakuru is square and corresponds to the square hearth of the enriching <em>homa</em>.130 In terms of the directional positions, they do not match the correspondences between the shapes of the hearths and the continents. Similarly, the colors of the four continents do not correspond to the colors of the homa hearths. Although there are similarities in shapes between the <em>homa</em> hearths and the four continents, we have no tangible evidence to assert that they are related to each other, like the three Vedic fires are related to the three Vedic worlds.</p>
<p>According to Abhayākaragupta,131 when one takes into consideration the various categories of living beings, then the number of <em>homa</em> hearths is countless. When one takes into account the classification into the five Buddha families, then there are five different hearths. Then again when one classifies the <em>homa</em> rites according to their different activities (<em>karma</em>), there are four different hearths as described above. Abhayākaragupta further says that all such classifications have been explained by the Buddha himself. Then he goes on to say that in a certain <em>tantra</em> named <em>Vajrakrodha-samāpattiguhya</em>, it is stated that there are one hundred and ten different <em>homa</em> hearths in relation to different activities. Thus, the hearth for the peaceful rite is round, square for the enriching rite, triangular for the fierce rite, like a hook for the summoning rite, and like a <em>vajra</em> for the subduing rite. In order to attract wealth and rich harvest, the hearth should be shaped like a jewel, and in order to acquire an ability to change bodily forms, it should be designed like a <em>liṅga</em>. When one wishes to become invisible, the hearth should be designed like a bow with an arrow, and when one wishes to dominate over other people, it should be shaped like a sword. In order to remove sins, the hearth should be designed like a circle with an arch. When one wishes to impassion one’s <em>vidyā</em>, the hearth should be shaped like the <em>mudrā</em> of one’s Buddha family. In order to gain an ability to fly in the sky, the hearth should resemble the vault of heaven. When one endeavors to enhance one’s learning, the hearth should be designed like a blazing flame. In order to perform the evocation of the great <em>maṇḍala</em>, the hearth should be designed like a wheel. Finally, the all-encompassing hearth (<em>sarvakarma</em>) should be square. Abhayākaragupta does not give more descriptions of <em>homa</em> hearths from that text, but his selection is an adequate indication to realize the wide-ranging variations in the designs of the <em>homa</em> hearths.</p>
<p>Abhayākaragupta also briefly explains the designs of <em>homa</em> hearths in several other tantric texts. In the <em>Susiddhikara</em> and several other <em>tantras</em>,132 the all-encompassing hearth is square, one cubit big and half a cubit deep. In the <em>Subāhuparipṛcchā</em> and two other <em>tantras</em>,133 the same hearth is described as having the shape of a lotus (<em>padma</em>). It is round, one cubit large and half a cubit deep. One lotus rests at the center and is surrounded by eight lotuses. Its border is designed like lotus leaves. On the outside, it is encircled by a lotus garland, and the inner border is formed by a garland of <em>vajras</em>. On the lotuses positioned toward the cardinal directions there are the emblems of the four Buddha Families: <em>vajra</em>, jewel, lotus, and crossed <em>vajra</em>. On the lotuses facing the intermediate directions, there are a pair of eyes, a three-pronged <em>vajra</em>, a <em>padma</em>, and an <em>utpala</em>. On the lotus resting in the center, there is a wheel with eight spokes.</p>
<p>In the <em>Kālacakra,</em> the hearth for the pacifying rite is round and one cubit large. For the enriching rite, it is square and two cubits large. For the fierce rite (<em>abhicāra</em>), it is shaped like a bow and is half a cubit big. For the rite of summoning (<em>ākṛṣṭi</em>), it is triangular and twenty fingers big. For the rite of despising (<em>vidveṣa</em>), it is shaped like a pentagon (<em>pañcakoṇa</em>). For the rite of confusing (<em>mohana</em>), it has six sides (<em>ṣaṭkona</em>) and is sixty fingers large. For the rite of subduing, it has seven sides (<em>saptakoṇa</em>) and is forty fingers big. For the rite of destroying (<em>stambhana</em>), it is octagonal (<em>aṣṭakona</em>) and sixty fingers big. Finally, the hearth for the all-encompassing rite is round.</p>
<p>In the <em>Buddhakapāla</em>, the hearth for the peaceful rite is square and one span big. For the enriching rite, it is round and three spans big. For the subduing rite, it is triangular and eight fingers big. Finally, the hearth for the fierce rite is shaped like a half moon and is one cubit big.</p>
<p>Thus, in addition to the four principal or standard <em>homa</em> hearths, there is a fair range of other <em>homa</em> hearths. The reasons for having such a variety of <em>homa</em> hearths are not fully articulated in the consulted sources. Similarly, we find no explanations of the symbolism and significance of the <em>homa</em> hearths in terms of their shapes and colors.</p>
<p>The exposition of the transcendent <em>homa</em> that now follows, basically consists of a paraphrased résumé of Vīryavajra’s commentary on the sixth chapter of the <em>Saṃpuṭa-tantra</em>. In the third section of chapter six, the Buddha gives a fairly esoteric and terse exposition of the <em>cakras</em> located within the body, libations (<em>yajñā</em>), <em>homa</em>, recitations, meditation, and several other things. The résumé covers the bodily <em>maṇḍala</em>, libations and <em>homa</em>. Vīryavajra’s commentary is succinct and presumes much knowledge on the part of the reader.</p>
<p>Body <em>maṇḍala</em>. This section explains the power <em>cakras</em> that abide in the body in the form of channels or veins (<em>nāḍī</em>). The yogi is the support generated from the blissful <em>samādhi</em>, and it is through the veins that is displayed the dexterity of the bodily <em>cakras</em>. Heruka and other deities denote the sixty-two deities abiding in the bodily <em>cakra</em>. Lalanā is on the left of the head cakra, and Rasanā is on its right. Avadhūtī is in the middle. This is the pledge (<em>samaya</em>) <em>cakra</em> consisting of thirty-two veins (<em>ṇādī</em>). The head <em>cakra</em> is one unit, but in terms of the veins, it is reckoned to be three <em>cakras</em>. The <em>bodhicitta</em> is explained as being thirty-two (veins). Others explain that the body, speech, and mind cakras abide in twenty-four bodily locations. The feet are the wind circle, the navel the fire, the stomach the water, the heart the earth, and the head is the space circle. Such are the bodily <em>cakras</em>.</p>
<p>Next a fuller explanation is given. The soles of the feet have the shape of a bow, and so the feet form a bow and the wind circle. The navel is triangular and the fire circle. The stomach is round and the water circle. The heart is square and the earth circle. The spine stands for Mount Meru. On this occasion the thirty-two veins form the body <em>maṇḍala</em>. Lalanā is on the left and denotes the vowels. Rasanā is on the right and generates brightness. Avadhūtī is in the middle, and epitomises a ‘hermaphrodite’ (<em>paṇḍaka</em>). On her left and right sides there are the four meditative absorptions (<em>bhāvanā</em>) and the four cardinal directions. They are the abiding location of the thirty-two veins. Inside the head there is the famous brain (knowledge), and it epitomises the moon circle. Inside the veins there is the life-wind in the form of a drop (<em>bindu</em>). The <em>bodhicitta</em> is clear or bright, and the blood fluid is unclear. The <em>bodhicitta</em> is naturally clear, because it denotes the brightness of knowledge.</p>
<p>Caṇḍālī is the wind repository of the hot space. She diffuses from the bodily pores and melts the <em>bodhicitta</em> at the crown of the head. Through doing this, day and night, at the time of breathing in and out, the ambrosia moon trickles, and through this the <em>maṇḍala</em> becomes perfected. Why is this called <em>maṇḍala</em>? Since Caṇḍālī’s heat reaches the drop (<em>bindu</em>) of the <em>bodhicitta</em> positioned inside the thirty-two veins, and since the essence is obtained, it is called the <em>maṇḍala</em>.</p>
<p>Oblation or sacrifice (<em>yajña</em>). This time the body abides in the manner of embracing all sorts of outer and inner things. Outwardly, there are the five objects of sense desire (<em>kāmaguṇa</em>). Inwardly, there abide the five ambrosias as the articles that perfect the body. Outwardly, the body performs the worship by generating the <em>samādhi</em> of the four joys together with Vajriṇī and others. Inwardly, the bodily liquid of the five ambrosias generates the bodily bliss. This outer and inner essence is called the <em>vajrin</em> of the <em>bodhicitta</em>. As for the so-called gross and subtle body, the gross body denotes the matter and other objects of the five senses. The subtle body stands for the five ambrosias that generate the bodily and mental bliss. The objects of the worship are the living beings having the nature of the Buddhas. Since the minds of living beings are naturally luminous, they perform the worship by generating the four joys. The immense bliss that arises from the five objects and the five ambrosias denotes the Buddha arising from this very attainment, or from the <em>maṇḍala</em>. The immense bliss denotes the first absorption (<em>dhyāna</em>). After adhering to the <em>dhyāna</em> bliss, the insight (<em>vipaśyanā</em>) extensively seals things with emptiness, and it is at this moment that the state of Buddhahood is attained.</p>
<p>Internal <em>homa</em>. The term inner implies the semen and other things. Inwardly, there are the five ambrosias, the five aggregates (<em>skandha</em>), and the eighteen elements (<em>dhātu</em>). Outwardly, there are the six sense objects, along with the realisation of wisdom as having the nature of emptiness. Blazing with this wisdom fire, one performs the transcendent <em>homa</em>: one burns the <em>homa</em> articles in the fire of luminosity (<em>prabhāsvara</em>). Such is the transcendent <em>homa</em>.</p>
<p>Secret exposition. The five aggregates have the nature of the superior deities. One generates the aggregates into the nature of deities, and one arranges them inside the four <em>cakras</em> positioned at the navel, the heart, the throat, and in the head. One transforms one’s hands into the two <em>homa</em> ladles, and the food articles into the nature of ambrosia. It is with this kind of articles that one performs the act of worship and gratification.</p>
<p>Secret <em>homa</em>. This <em>homa</em> follows the path of passions, and it is the worship consisting of the union with the <em>ḍākinī</em>. The bodies of Wisdom and Means are purified with the fourfold rite of worship and attainment (<em>sevāsādhana</em>), and the <em>vajra</em> and the <em>padma</em> are duly consecrated (<em>adhiṣṭhāna</em>). It is with the ladle of the <em>bodhicitta</em> that one performs the <em>homa</em> of the blissful <em>samādhi</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>homa</em> of the path of liberation. In this <em>homa</em> the head’s skull is the vessel for the <em>homa</em> articles: the five ambrosias. Inside the heart, on the right side of the <em>dharmacakra</em> is Rasanā epitomising the first <em>homa</em> ladle, and on the left side is Lalanā epitomising the second <em>homa</em> ladle. At the navel there is the fire circle as the hearth. Inside the head, one generates the pure self-arising fire by means of the karma wind. It is in this way that one performs this <em>homa</em>. After that one perform a series of recitations.1</p>
<h3 id="conclusion-part-two">Conclusion (Part Two)</h3>
<p>As we have seen, in the early sources the bloody sacrifices are rejected, but eventually the positive values of the Vedic sacrifices are reinterpreted into the practice of generosity and superior ways of religious life. The god Agni as the priest of the Vedic sacrifices is completely obliterated, but the three Vedic fires are reinterpreted in positive and constructive ways. The <em>homa</em> rites are rejected, and we find no evidence in the early Buddhist sources of any attempts at their reinterpretation. Then there elapsed a considerable period of time before the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rites became fully assimilated into the tantric pantheon and rituals. Just as the Vedic sacrifices were transformed into internal sacrifices, the Buddhist <em>homa</em> rites were eventually converted into internal or meditative <em>homas</em>.</p>
<p>As such, the <em>homa</em> rituals occupy a prominent position in the <em>tantras</em> as the expedients and means of pacifying adverse forces, and of accomplishing beneficial tasks, such as bringing prosperity or accumulating merit. At the present time, the <em>homa</em> rites continue to be practiced by all the religious orders of Tibetan Buddhism and by several Japanese orders such as Shingon and Tendai.</p>
<h2 id="part-three-fire-in-the-mundane-and-transcendent-paths">PART THREE FIRE IN THE MUNDANE AND TRANSCENDENT PATHS</h2>
<p>The third and final part is divided into three integrated sections. Section one outlines the formulation and scope of the mundane and transcendent paths. Section two deals with the innate permutations of the mundane path. More specifically, it assesses the inherent capacities of the fire and the other three elements of matter, establishes the body‒mind relationship, and ascertains the yoga methods of gaining mastery over the properties of the primary elements. In this section the discussion covers all four primary elements, because they coexist inseparably and constitute four distinct properties of matter. Section three ascertains the luminous configurations of the transcendent path. The dominant focus of this section is on the subtle permutations of consciousness, which is epitomized by luminosity or subtle energies. On the whole, sections two and three are not particularly concerned with meditation techniques, but largely focus on the inner dynamics and specific concerns of the mundane and transcendent paths.</p>
<h3 id="formulation-and-scope-of-the-mundane-and-transcendent-paths">Formulation and Scope of the Mundane and Transcendent Paths</h3>
<p>The Buddha’s mystical experience on the night of his enlightenment is not recorded in Buddhist sources in the form of a single and fixed account, but it is divulged in a number of variant versions.134 We shall briefly discuss three selected versions below in order to determine the content of the Buddha’s meditative stages that culminated in his enlightenment. However, before doing this, it is constructive to sketch the formulation and character of the mundane and transcendent paths. Although these two paths were formulated after the Buddha’s enlightenment, logically they come first, because they demarcate the boundary between the mundane and transcendent components of his progress to enlightenment.</p>
<p>As he sat under the <em>bodhi</em> tree, Siddhārtha was no more than a human being, but at the same time he was a highly prodigious and accomplished yogi. He was versed in meditation techniques of ancient India and also fully acquainted with philosophical speculations current in his time. He did not seem to profess any specific body of doctrines, but at the same time for six years he was overwhelmed with a persistent quest for the truth about human nature and destiny.</p>
<p>It seems that on that night, in the first phase of his mystical musing, Siddhārtha followed the same meditative route as other accomplished yogis of his time, that is to say he penetrated into the four absorptions (<em>dhyāna</em>). According to some accounts, he also penetrated the four formless attainments (<em>samāpatti</em>). Then, in the second phase, he experienced a kind of unique insight, which is described in variant ways, but it is agreed that essentially this unique insight consisted in the attainment of enlightenment and freedom from karma. Thus, it is in this second phase that Siddhārtha penetrated into the mystery of phenomena and became a Buddha.</p>
<p>At some later period, the Abhidharma masters separated or divided Siddhārtha’s meditative stages into two distinct but interlinked phases, which they, respectively, called mundane path (<em>laukika</em>-<em>mārga</em>) and transcendent path (<em>lokottara</em>-<em>mārga</em>).135</p>
<p>Putting aside minor details, in the mundane path they included the four absorptions and the four formless attainments, and the five kinds of direct knowledge (<em>abhijñā</em>), which respectively constitute the ancient yoga practices and their fruits. In Buddhist sources these ancient practices are treated as crucial and viable meditative techniques, but at the same time they are downgraded and classed as a mundane path. They are graded in this way, because this path is within the capacity and reach of non-Buddhist yogis (<em>pṛthagjana</em>),136 but mainly because it brings only provisional or mundane benefits and does not culminate in the state of true liberation or enlightenment. Thus, essentially, the highest reward of this path is the attainment of the five kinds of direct knowledge that are discussed in section two.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the transcendent path, the Buddhist masters included the Buddha’s unique insight. In the Abhidharma sources this path is subdivided into two phases also called paths, namely the path of vision (<em>darśana</em>-<em>mārga</em>) and the path of meditative cultivation (<em>bhāvanā</em>-<em>mārga</em>). While the path of vision penetrates into the four noble truths and eliminates gross defilements, the path of meditative cultivation is linked with the noble eightfold path, removes the remainder of defilements, and culminates in the attainment of <em>nirvāṇa</em> or enlightenment. The transcendent path is so called, because it abandons all mundane concerns and entanglements, and because it secures emancipation from the bonds of <em>saṃsāra</em>.</p>
<p>The mundane and transcendent paths are also known by other names, such as impure (<em>sāsrava</em>) and pure (<em>anāsrava</em>) paths, or calmness (<em>śamatha</em>) and insight (<em>vipaśyanā</em>). Now we can ascertain the three selected versions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, and identify its mundane and transcendent components.</p>
<h4 id="enlightenment-as-acquisition-of-three-knowledges">Enlightenment as Acquisition of Three Knowledges</h4>
<p>In the Pāli <em>Vinaya</em> and in a number of <em>suttas</em>, the Buddha’s enlightenment is described as acquisition of three kinds of knowledge (<em>tevijjā</em>). According to this version, the Buddha penetrated into the four absorptions, and then in the fourth absorption, he gained three kinds of knowledge. In the first watch of the night, he gained the knowledge of his past lives. In the second watch, he gained the knowledge of the arising and passing away of other beings in conformity with their good and bad deeds. In the third watch, he directed his mind to the acquisition of the knowledge that destroys the influxes or depravities (<em>āsrava</em>-<em>kṣaya</em>-<em>jñāna</em>).137 In the first instance, he gained insight into the four noble truths and then realized the destruction of the influxes. Finally, he uttered: “Birth is extinguished for me, the mendicant life has been lived, done is what was to be done, there is no more becoming here.”138</p>
<p>Since in the accounts presented below the first two kinds of knowledge are the same as in the above version, we ascertain only the character of the third knowledge, which is described differently or in modified forms.</p>
<p>In the <em>Jātakanidāna</em>, the third knowledge is laconically described as the realization of dependent origination in a direct and reverse order.139 Out of the two versions recorded in the <em>Mahāvastu</em>, the first version says that in the third watch of the night, the Bodhisattva gained the supreme and perfect enlightenment by means of wisdom associated with a single mental moment (<em>ekacitta</em>). In this account, there is no mention of the four truths or the destruction of the influxes.140</p>
<p>According to the second version, during the third watch of the night, the Bodhisattva became enlightened in a single mental moment, perceived the four truths and gained the destruction of the influxes. After that, he understood the twelve links of dependent origination in a direct and reverse order, and grasped that all mental formations are impermanent and painful, that all phenomena are without a self, and that <em>nirvāṇa</em> is peaceful and constitutes the dissolution of phenomena and the end of craving.141</p>
<p>According to the <em>Lalitavistra</em>, during the third watch the Bodhisattva directed his luminous mind to the elimination of suffering and its source, and to the knowledge that destroys the influxes. In the first instance, he understood the twelve links of dependent origination in a direct and reverse order. Then he realized somewhat concurrently the four noble truths and the destruction of the influxes. This account concludes by stating that during the third watch, the Bodhisattva became perfectly enlightened with wisdom associated with one mental moment and acquired the three kinds of knowledge (<em>traividyā</em>).142</p>
<p>The <em>Saṅghabhedavastu</em> confuses the watches of the night, as it refers to the first watch and then to three middle watches. Putting aside this sequential confusion, it is clear that according to this text, the Bodhisattva gained four kinds of knowledge. First, he gained the knowledge of magical powers. Second, he gained the knowledge of reading the minds of other beings. Third, he gained the knowledge of the arising and passing away of other beings in conformity with their deeds. At the end of this musing he became aware that living beings circulate in <em>saṃsāra</em> due to the force of the three influxes. Fourth, he directed his mind to the knowledge that destroys the influxes: he perceived the four truths and gained the knowledge that destroyed his influxes. Finally, this text says that having become enlightened, the Lord accomplished the fire element, but regrettably it provides no further explanation.143</p>
<p>Allowing for some modifications, the above sources broadly agree that the Buddha gained the three kinds of knowledge. In fact in some of his discourses, the Buddha openly claimed that he had mastery of the three kinds of knowledge.144 These three kinds of knowledge are included among the Buddha’s ten powers145 and are also classed as the three qualities of the adepts beyond training (<em>aśaikṣa</em>).146</p>
<p>Most of the above texts say that in the third watch, the Buddha realized the four noble truths and gained the destruction of the influxes. However, when it comes to identify the essence of his enlightenment, the canonical and later texts unanimously agree that it consisted in the knowledge of the destruction of the influxes (<em>āsravakṣaya</em>-<em>jñāna</em>). This knowledge is paired with a second knowledge called the knowledge of non-arising (<em>anutpādajñāna</em>). Some texts clearly indicate that these two kinds of knowledge are conjectured and formulated on the basis of the Buddha’s utterance at the end of the third watch of the night. The knowledge of the destruction of the influxes is said to epitomize the expression “done is what was to be done,” and the second knowledge epitomizes the expression “there is no more becoming here.”147 Thus, the essence of the Buddha’s enlightenment fundamentally consisted in the realization of the destruction of karma and freedom from future rebirths.</p>
<p>In terms of the paths, the first two kinds of knowledge are largely identical with the two kinds of direct knowledge called the divine eye and the divine ear, which appertain to the group of the five kinds of direct knowledge that are shared with the non-Buddhist yogis, and thus they appertain to the mundane path. On the other hand, the third knowledge, the destruction of the influxes, epitomizes the transcendent path, as it constituted the Buddha’s unique and exclusive insight. In Buddhist sources, this knowledge is added to the five kinds of direct knowledge as the sixth, but it is firmly asserted that this knowledge is accessible only to the Buddha and his accomplished disciples.</p>
<p>What is the actual difference between the <em>abhijñās</em> of non-Buddhist yogis and the Buddha’s three <em>vidyās</em>? Although the majority of Buddhist traditions admit that non-Buddhist yogis can gain the mundane <em>abhijñās</em>, they make a firm distinction between the qualities of non-Buddhist and Buddhist <em>abhijñās</em>. Some sources show the difference by differentiating between three terms: <em>abhijñā, vidyā</em>, and <em>bala</em> (domination). The non-Buddhist yogis can gain the <em>abhijñās</em> of their previous lives and of the divine eye, but the range and quality of their <em>abhijñās</em> are limited. They have visions of a restricted number of their previous lives and of other beings, but they do not acquire their knowledge (<em>vidyā</em>). In other words, they see those things, but do not understand their karmic causes and conditions. In the case of the Buddha’s disciples, they possess both the <em>abhijñās</em> and their <em>vidyās</em>. In addition to possessing the <em>abhijñās</em>, which are stronger than those of non-Buddhist yogis, they also possess their <em>vidyās</em>, because they understand their karmic causes and conditions. Finally, the Buddha possesses <em>abhijñās, vidyās</em>, and <em>balas</em>. His <em>abhijñās</em> are unlimited in range, his <em>vidyās</em> are perfect, and his <em>bala</em> or domination over his <em>abhijñās</em> is unwavering.148</p>
<p>Putting aside the Buddhist contentions, it seems fairly clear that the difference between the <em>abhijñās</em> of non-Buddhist yogis and the <em>abhijñās, vidyās</em>, and <em>balas</em> of the Buddhist adepts essentially entails the degree or intensity of control and knowledge.149 To put it differently, the Buddha’s experience or vision in the course of the <em>abhijñās</em> was essentially the same as that of other yogis of his time, but he was the first one to conjecture their true character and significance.</p>
<h4 id="enlightenment-through-the-nine-progressive-dwellings">Enlightenment through the Nine Progressive Dwellings</h4>
<p>According to the second version,150 the Buddha became enlightened through the penetration into the nine progressive dwellings (<em>anupūrva</em>-<em>vihara</em>), namely the four absorptions, the four formless attainments, and the cessation of perception and sensation (<em>nirodha</em>-<em>samāpatti</em>). In the light of this account the Buddha did not penetrate into the nine progressive dwellings in one single session, but at consecutive intervals. First, he penetrated into the first absorption, and then having assessed disadvantages of the first absorption and advantages of the second absorption, at some later time, he penetrated into the second absorption. He progressed in the same manner through the next six dwellings. Finally, upon entering and abiding in the cessation of perception and sensation, he saw with wisdom and his influxes became completely destroyed.</p>
<p>In this account the Buddha does not mention the four truths, and he concludes his discourse, stating that he did not claim to be fully enlightened until he penetrated those nine progressive dwellings in a forward and reverse order. As he does not specify where and when it all happened, the precise place and time of this enlightenment remain unspecified.151</p>
<p>In this version, the four absorptions and the four formless attainments constitute the components of the mundane path, and the cessation of perception and sensation constitutes the transcendent path, as this cessation is said to be accessible only to the Buddha and his accomplished disciples. Thus, this account also combines the ancient yoga practices with a specifically Buddhist factor, the cessation of perception and sensation.</p>
<h4 id="enlightenment-through-combining-two-paths">Enlightenment through Combining Two Paths</h4>
<p>The third version of the Buddha’s enlightenment is the product of the Vaibhāṣikas, a branch of the Sarvāstivāda school, and largely corresponds to their Abhidharma formulation of the mundane and transcendent paths. According to this version, the Buddha gained enlightenment by following two consecutive paths, first the mundane path and then the transcendent path. Initially, he penetrated the four absorptions and the first three formless attainments. Through doing this he eliminated the defilements of the Kāmadhātu, of the four absorptions, and of the first three formless attainments. However, the residual defilements of the fourth formless attainment or the pinnacle of existence (<em>bhavāgra</em>) still persisted within him. According to Buddhist sources, the yogis of ancient India had no method or capacity to free themselves from the pinnacle of existence by way of their meditative techniques as explained later. However, in the case of Siddhārtha some extraordinary experience took place. Having reached the pinnacle of existence, he relied on the fourth absorption and generated the path of vision. Then he entered the cessation of perception and sensation. Then once more relying on the fourth absorption, he abandoned the defilements of the pinnacle of existence by means of the meditative cultivation. Finally, he gained the knowledge of the destruction of the influxes, and became a perfectly enlightened Buddha.</p>
<p>During the path of vision, in the course of sixteen mental events (<em>cittakṣaṇa</em>), he gained the realization (<em>abhisamaya</em>) of the four noble truths. Then at the time of becoming detached (<em>vairāgya</em>) from the defilements of the pinnacle of existence, he executed eighteen mental moments: nine moments of the uninterrupted path (<em>ānantarya</em>-<em>mārga</em>) and nine moments of the liberation path (<em>vimukti</em>-<em>mārga</em>). Altogether he executed thirty-four mental moments, during which he realized the four noble truths, and gained the detachment and liberation from all defilements and ignorance.152</p>
<p>It is evident from this account that except for the defilements of the pinnacle of existence, the mundane path is capable of eliminating the defilements inherent in all the lower levels of the threefold existence. Thus, although this path is considered by Buddhist masters to have a limited range of efficacy, it is evident that ultimately it is essential as the foundation for the practice of the transcendent path, and for the attainment of enlightenment, because the practice and efficacy of the transcendent path require the proficiency in the practice of the four absorptions and also because enlightenment is gained in the fourth absorption. It is clear that the mundane path has the capacity to eliminate defilements, and that in terms of the five kinds of direct knowledge, it provides naked visions of phenomena. However, it does not seem to divulge cognitive insights into their nature. It is the transcendent path that sheds cognitive perceptions and insights into phenomena in conformity with Buddhist doctrines. Thus, it is the transcendent path that differentiates Buddhism from other yogic traditions of ancient India.</p>
<p>When one glances at the above three versions of the Buddha’s enlightenment, one can see a combination of yogic practices of ancient India and specifically Buddhist elements. In the first two accounts, the ancient yogic practices are the same, but the depictions of the Buddha’s enlightenment are not, and this shows Buddhist attempts to unravel and formulate the nature of his mystic experience under the <em>bodhi</em> tree. In the third version, devised centuries after the Buddha’s enlightenment, the phases of his enlightenment are depicted in terms of matured Abhidharma doctrines. The mundane path receives its due recognition, but otherwise it is somewhat overshadowed by the transcendent path that is formulated in the light of Buddhist doctrines.</p>
<p>Having sketched the respective scopes of the mundane and transcendental paths, and their function in the Buddha’s enlightenment, we now proceed to treat these two paths separately.</p>
<h3 id="the-innate-permutations-of-the-mundane-path">**The Innate Permutations of the Mundane Path</h3>
<p>Prior to providing an exposition of the mundane path, it is instructive to ascertain the properties of the bodily and mental components of a human being, and to establish their relationship as this will disclose the yogic potentialities and dynamics embedded in the body‒mind complex.</p>
<h4 id="composition-of-a-human-being">Composition of a Human Being</h4>
<p>In Buddhist sources the composition and function of a human being is primarily analyzed in terms of the five aggregates (<em>skandha</em>), the twelve bases (<em>āyatana</em>), and the eighteen elements (<em>dhātu</em>). In addition to this threefold analysis, the Buddhist sources also maintain that a human being consists of six elements (<em>dhātu</em>): earth, water, fire, wind, space, and consciousness.153 Broadly speaking in this configuration, the first five elements constitute the primary components of the physical body, and the element of consciousness constitutes the immaterial element, the mind. Thus, basically a human being consists of body and mind.</p>
<p>According to the Pāli sources, the first four elements, jointly called primary elements (<em>mahābhūta</em>), constitute the four basic constituents or domains (<em>dhātu</em>) of all material phenomena (<em>rūpa</em>). Although they are treated as four seemingly different elements, essentially they always coexist together and are never dissociated from each other. None of them can exist independently or in isolation from the other three. They are inseparable, but they do not mingle and do not abide inside or outside each other, and yet they are said to have no independent status. They are coordinate and constitute four distinct energies or properties of matter. Furthermore, the same sources say that there is no variation in their quantitative volumes, but they enter into the composition of all material phenomena in equal proportions. The diversity of material things is not attributed to different quantities of the four elements, but to their respective capabilities or intensities. Thus the quantity of each element is always the same, but its intensity fluctuates in different material phenomena. For instance, the amount of water in a conflagration is the same as in wood or soil. In hard objects such as rocks or iron it is the earth element that prevails, and in seas and lakes it is the water element that prevails over the other elements.154</p>
<p>Each of the four elements has its particular nature or characteristic, and its specific activity or function. The proper nature of the earth element is solidity or hardness, and its function is to act as the support of all material phenomena. The nature of water is moisture or fluidity, and its function is cohesion in the sense of binding material phenomena together. The nature of fire is heat and its function is ripening by way of heating and maturing (aging) material phenomena. The nature of the wind element is motion or mobility, and its function is expansion by way of dilating and displacing material phenomena. In terms of their mutual relationship, the four elements support each other through the performance of their respective functions, namely support, cohesion, maintenance, and expansion.155</p>
<p>In addition to the four elements that jointly constitute the primary matter, Buddhist sources also establish a number of secondary categories of matter that derive from the primary matter. While the Theravāda sources distinguish twenty-four categories of derived matter,156 the Sarvāstivāda adepts identify only eleven categories.157 Putting aside their differences, the derived matter essentially consists of the five sense faculties, and their five external objects. The eye and the remaining four sense faculties constitute the category of sensitive or subtle matter, and serve as the supports of the five kinds of sense consciousness. When they are in conjunction with the sense consciousness, they can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Similarly the external matter as objects of the five sense faculties is also classified into five categories, namely shape, sound, fragrance, flavor, and tangibility; they are seen, heard, smelt, tasted, and touched.158</p>
<p>Although Buddhist sources refer to the smallest unit of matter as atom or monad, they do not recognize the existence of individual atoms in isolation, but postulate that the smallest unit of matter forms a molecule. According to the Vaibhāṣikas, the basic molecule of matter includes eight things: the four primary elements and four elements of the derived matter, namely color, smell, taste, and tangibility.159</p>
<p>According to some masters, the basic property of molecular matter is breakage, because it is susceptible to mutability, deterioration, and transformation. Some other masters maintain that the primary quality of matter is not breakage, but impenetrability or resistance. Material objects are mutual obstacles in the sense that one object prevents another object from occupying the same space.160</p>
<p>Space as the fifth element is not the same in character as the four material elements discussed above, but it is treated in conjunction with matter, because space and material objects coexist. The Vaibhāṣikas make a distinction between the space element (<em>ākāśadhātu</em>) and space (<em>ākāśa</em>). The space element is defined as cavity or empty space in the body and in material objects. The cavities in the body, such as the ones inside the mouth and the stomach, are classed as internal cavities, and the cavities inside outer objects as external cavities. They further clarify that the term “cavity” should be understood as light and darkness, because light or darkness is perceived inside cavities. In the Vaibhāṣika system space is classed as an unconditioned phenomenon and is defined as non-obstruction and spatial expanse within which material things exist and move. As such space is unimpeded by material things that freely rest and move within it.161</p>
<p>Finally, according to the Vaibhāṣikas, the element of consciousness denotes the impure consciousness, which includes the five types of sense consciousness and mind-consciousness. This complex of consciousness is said to be impure when it does not form an integral part of the path, but when it is integrated into the path it is pure and sustains the process of liberation.162</p>
<p>Taken together the six elements support the flux of human existence from the moment of conception to the moment of death.163 The material elements sustain the bodily vitality, and the element of consciousness directs the course of bodily and mental activities. The span of life is determined by the quality and force of karma accumulated in the past life or lives.</p>
<p>Having described the basic qualities and functions of the six elements that make up a human being, we now proceed to establish the interrelation and dynamics of the body‒mind complex.</p>
<h4 id="interrelation-and-dynamics-of-the-bodymind-complex">Interrelation and Dynamics of the Body‒Mind Complex</h4>
<p>Broadly speaking the basic interrelation between body and mind is that of appropriation. According to the <em>Abhidharmakośa</em>, it is the element or aggregate of consciousness that appropriates the matter included in the aggregate of matter. More specifically, the mind and its concomitants (<em>citta-caitta</em>) appropriate the sensitive matter, namely the five sense organs. They also appropriate the external matter, be it form, odor, or flavor, when the external things are present as objects. The term ‘appropriate’ means that both material and mental objects are seized or grasped by the mind and its concomitants as their supports and objects. On the other hand, the five kinds of sense consciousness and mind-consciousness are not appropriated by the body or the material objects.164 Thus, it is the mind that takes control of the sensitive matter embedded in the physical body, and then intercepts and interacts with the surrounding world that appears in the form of objects.</p>
<p>In terms of ethical qualities, in the Theravāda sources, the primary matter is defined as undetermined, which means it is pure and not involved in the karma production. However, the compounded or derived matter is said to be mundane, defiled, favorable to defilements, and subject to decay.165 According to the Vaibhāṣikas, the five material sense faculties are ethically undetermined, but the bodily and verbal actions are ethically good or bad, depending whether they are instigated by good or bad states of consciousness.166</p>
<p>The majority of Buddhist sources maintain that the natural state of consciousness is luminous (<em>prakṛtiprabhāsvara</em>), but it is defiled due to its entanglement in mundane activities. When it is associated either with the three wholesome roots or the three unwholesome roots, its ethical quality is respectively classified as good and bad. These two kinds of consciousness are productive of karma, which leads to rebirth and generates a new body. Jointly they are called mundane consciousness, because they are impure and lead to further rebirths. By contrast the transcendent consciousness is pure when it is linked with the eightfold path, and thus it is free from karma and does not search for further bodily rebirths.167</p>
<p>In relation to the three spheres of existence, the body‒mind complex is differentiated into three levels. In the <em>kāmadhātu</em>, the body is gross and it is defiled with sensual pleasures. In the <em>rūpadhātu</em>, the bodies of living beings are made up of subtle or refined matter, and in the <em>ārūpyadhātu</em>, they are said to be immaterial or bodiless. In the <em>kāmadhātu</em>, the consciousness is constrained by the gross body, and it is distracted and overwhelmed by sensual pleasures. In the <em>rūpadhātu</em>, it is highly agile and concentrated, and it is pure and free from the sensual pleasures of the <em>kāmadhātu</em>. This is the sphere of the four absorptions in which the consciousness is steadfast (<em>āniñjya</em>) and focused on one single object. In the formless sphere, the <em>ārūpyadhātu</em>, the consciousness is even more agile and free from the confinement and material resistance. Essentially the basic character of consciousness is the same in every living being, but its comprehension, agility, and efficiency are different in different bodies and different levels of existence. While the gross body of the <em>kāmadhātu</em> cannot move to the two higher sphere, the consciousness of this sphere can ascend and acquire the refined states of the two higher levels, provided it gains the proficiency in entering the four absorptions and the four formless attainments.168</p>
<p>How do matter and consciousness relate in terms of causality? According to the <em>Abhidharmakośa</em>, the four great elements are their own causes as coextensive and reciprocal causes. They are also the generative causes of the derived categories of matter. In addition, they also support, sustain, maintain, and influence the transformation of secondary matter, namely the body and material phenomena.169</p>
<p>The Theravāda sources maintain that matter like <em>nirvāṇa</em> has no causal capacity (<em>ahetuka</em>),170 but it is produced by other causes as discussed below. Although matter has no causal capacity, the same sources maintain that the four primary elements constitute conditions by way of co-arising and supporting the derived matter.171 In terms of causality, the Pāli sources say that material phenomena originate in four ways, namely from karma, consciousness, temperature, and nutriment. As the expositions of these four kinds of origination are rather complex, we sketch here only their basic character. The karma in the form of good and bad volitions produces conditioned material phenomena. It generates material phenomena when the consciousness arises at the moment of conception, during the course of existence, and up to the moment of death. It seems that strictly speaking, the consciousness does not produce matter, but it does set up or prompts certain material phenomena, and it is the condition for their arising or movement. Temperature (<em>utu</em>) denotes the fire element, and it originates the nutritional matter in the body, and it is a condition for the occurrence and destruction of material phenomena. Nutriment is physical nutriment, and it is the nutritional condition for the body. Simply stated it is food that is consumed and digested.172</p>
<p>It does not need to be fully explained here, but only briefly stated that all physical and mental processes of the body‒mind complex evolve in conformity with the law of karma and the law of dependent origination. The law of karma determines the retribution of ethically qualified actions and also the places of rebirth in specific destinies. The law of dependent origination controls the co-arising and conditionality of all phenomena. Ethically qualified actions of individual beings assure their rebirths in specific places and planes in this world, and the combined actions of living beings produce the receptacle world.</p>
<p>Finally, let us glance at the positive and negative aspects of the relationship between the physical body and the immaterial consciousness. Essentially, the material aggregate as the body serves as the physical support and vehicle of consciousness and the other three immaterial aggregates. It provides them with the sensitive matter, namely the five sense faculties, through which they experience, and interact with the empirical world. Thus, the body sustains the stream of consciousness and provides it with all material provisions it needs to exist and function. This is the positive or constructive aspect of their relationship. In terms of negative propensities, the body confines the consciousness and restricts its spatial agility and movement. As discussed above, the sensitive matter is not ethically qualified as good or bad, but it is conducive to defilements. As the consciousness is unable to operate independently in the world, it seeks and takes possession of the body. While united with the body, it directs the bodily activities, cognizes, and interacts with the external phenomena, and through doing this it becomes defiled and produces karma. Once the body dies, the consciousness acquires the next body in conformity with the accumulated karma. This process continues existence after existence and constitutes the basic character of mundane existence. This is the negative aspect of their relationship. According to Buddhism mundane entanglements of consciousness generate a sea of suffering that must be eliminated. In order to eliminate suffering, the consciousness must abandon the body and discontinue to search for further rebirths. This can be achieved only through the purification of consciousness in the course of the mundane and transcendent paths.</p>
<h4 id="mundane-path-in-the-śrāvakabhūmi">Mundane Path in the <em>Śrāvakabhūmi</em></h4>
<p>In the Abhidharma sources, the mundane path is frequently incorporated into the so-called gradual path. Initially, one observes morality, trains in meditation, and studies Buddhist doctrines. Upon reaching a high level of proficiency in moral purity, meditation, and understanding, one as it were leaps into the transcendent path that leads to emancipation. The mundane path proper as described below can be also practiced as an alternative way of purification during the path of meditative cultivation. One of the best expositions of the mundane path as such is given in the <em>Śrāvakabhūmi</em>, which is included in the <em>Yogācārabhūmi</em>, a monumental treatise appertaining to the Yogācāra school. The <em>Śrāvakabhūmi</em> itself is a voluminous text, but here we only provide a summary of the chapter dealing specifically with the mundane path. It cannot be explained here but only indicated that prior to practicing the mundane path as described below, one needs to gain adequate skills in meditation that enables one to penetrate into the absorptions.173</p>
<p>According to the <em>Śrāvakabhūmi</em>, the mundane path consists of the progressive detachment from sensual pleasures through the perception of their crudity or coarseness, and through the perception of serenity or tranquility of the absorptions. This pattern of detachment from defilements begins with the detachment from the sensual pleasures of the Kāmadhātu and then progresses plane by plane up to the detachment from the plane of nothingness (<em>akiṃcanyāyatana</em>), which is the third plane of the Ārūpyadhātu. According to Buddhist perceptions, upon reaching the fourth plane of the Ārūpyadhātu, which is the pinnacle of existence (<em>bhavāgra</em>), the yogis cannot detach themselves from this plane by ascending to a higher plane, because there is no higher plane, and consequently they get as it were stuck. In order to become detached from this plane, two alternative methods are available, one non-Buddhist and one Buddhist. The <em>Śrāvakabhūmi</em> refers to these two methods as two attainments without mental operation (<em>acittika</em>). More specifically, the non-Buddhist method is called the attainment of non-perception (<em>asaṃjñā-samāpatti</em>), and the Buddhist method is called the attainment of the cessation of perception and sensation (<em>saṃjñāvedita</em>-<em>nirodha</em>-<em>samāpatti</em>). The mundane path culminates with the acquisition of the five kinds of intuitive knowledge (<em>abhijñā</em>) through the reliance on the absorptions.</p>
<p>Wishing to gain the detachment from sensual pleasures, the yogi strives to gain it by means of seven consecutive mental attentions or reflections (<em>manaskāra</em>). 1. In the first instant he endeavors to perceive the coarse character of sensual pleasures and the tranquility of the first absorption. 2. Next, he rises above the level of ordinary study and reflection, and gains the conviction or certitude (<em>adhimokṣa</em>) about the coarseness of sensual pleasures, and about the tranquility of the first absorption. 3. After that, he stimulates the path progressing toward the separation from defilements (<em>kleśa</em>). 4. As he discards defilements of the Kāmadhātu, he takes delight in their severance and abandonment. 5. Next, he turns his attention to pleasant objects, and as he realizes that he is still attached to them, he strives to bring about their complete elimination. 6. He continues to investigate and strive to separate from defilements of the Kāmadhātu, until he gains the first absorption, which acts as an effective antidote to defilements. 7. Finally, he fully gains the first absorption as the fruition of his efforts.174 The remaining three absorptions and the four formless attainments are gained by a similar set of reflections on the coarseness of the lower planes and the tranquility of the higher planes.175</p>
<p>As already stated above, the detachment from the pinnacle of existence (<em>bhavāgra</em>), the fourth and final plane of the Ārūpyadhātu, is attempted in two different but seemingly similar ways. The non-Buddhist adepts enter the attainment of non-perception and the Buddhist enter the attainment of the cessation of perception and sensation, which according to some sources the Buddha discovered on the night of his enlightenment.</p>
<p>In the case of the attainment of non-perception, the non-Buddhist yogis are said to turn away only from perception (<em>saṃjñā-vimukha</em>). They consider perception as illness and turn away from all perceptions.176 In the case of the cessation of perception and sensation, the Buddhist adepts aspire to abide in the state of supreme serenity, and upon reaching the plane of neither perception nor non-perception, they exert and press their minds upwards from this plane. As their minds are pressed upwards, they do not find any objects, and cease to function. Essentially, in this attainment all mental objects are eliminated.177</p>
<p>The five kinds of direct knowledge (<em>abhijñā</em>)178 are gained by relying on the absorptions; the <em>Abhidharmakośa</em> says by relying on the fourth absorption. First one learns all about these five kinds of knowledge and then one cultivates twelve perceptions (<em>saṃjñā</em>) in order to generate and bring them to maturation.179</p>
<p>Through the practice of the perceptions of lightness and softness, one becomes convinced that one’s body is light and soft like silk. The perception of the space element induces the conviction that one’s body is light and soft, and that any matter and material objects are like empty spaces. The perception of the mind‒body fusion is the one through which the mind is fused into the body or the body into the mind. This perception further reinforces one’s conviction of lightness and softness of one’s body. The perception of determination induces the conviction that remote objects are near, subtle things are coarse, course things are subtle, earth is water, or water is earth.</p>
<p>The effective practice of the above five perceptions leads to the acquisition of a number of magical powers (<em>ṛddhi</em>), such as multiplication, penetration through walls and mountains, submerging into the ground as if into water, walking on water, flying into the sky, and stroking the sun and the moon. One also wields the power over the four primary elements. These magical feats are largely performed through the perception of determination supported by the other four perceptions.180</p>
<p>The practice of the perception consisting in recalling one’s former deeds eventually concludes in the ability to view one’s previous lives. During the practice of the perception of sound, first one focuses on grasping the characteristics of different sounds, and then one directs one’s mental focus and attention toward specific sounds, and eventually one gains the divine ear and can hear human or divine sounds. During the practice of the perception of light, first one focuses on grasping the characteristic mark of light. Then upon grasping it from the perspective of different beings, one focuses on that characteristic mark by differentiating between the performance of good and bad actions. The cultivation of this perception yields the knowledge of the arising and passing away of other beings. One perceives with the divine eye how after their deaths, those beings are reborn in good or bad destinies. The perception of changes in material bodies induced by defilements consists in observing and ascertaining the physical conditions of living beings, such as verbal and facial expressions stemming from desire, hatred, stupidity, and other defilements. The cultivation of this perception induces the ability to read the minds of other beings.181 The cultivation of the eight liberations, the eight bases of mastery, and the ten totalities, enables one to generate noble magical powers (<em>ārya</em>-<em>ṛddhi</em>), such as transformations of things, freedom from impurities, and deep knowledge of the Buddhist teachings.182</p>
<p>Finally, drawing on some other sources, we briefly describe the yogic skills and qualities that are acquired through the practice of the ten totalities. The term “totality” translates the Pāli term <em>kasina</em> and the Sanskrit term <em>kṛtsna</em>. It is a particular form of meditation through which one gains a total control over the meditated objects and their qualities. There are ten <em>kasinas</em> altogether that enable one to gain control over the four primary elements, the four basic colors, light, and space.</p>
<p>The earth <em>kasina</em> is the basis for acquiring such powers as multiplying one’s body, standing on space or water by generating earth. The water <em>kasina</em> is the basis for being able to dive in and out of the earth, to cause rains, and to shake the earth. The fire <em>kasina</em> enables one to induce smoking and flaming,183 and to shower clusters of sparks. One can counteract fire with fire, and burn what one wants to burn. One can also cause light to see objects with the divine eye, and at the time of passing into <em>nibbāna</em> one can cremate one’s body by means of the fire element.184 The air <em>kasina</em> enables one to move with the speed of the wind, and to cause stormy winds. The light <em>kasina</em> serves as the basis for creating luminous forms, dispelling darkness, and causing light to see material objects with the divine eye. The color <em>kasiṇas</em> generate the power to create black, yellow, red, and white forms. Finally the space <em>kasina</em> enables one to sit inside the earth and rocks by creating holes inside them, and to pass through walls and solid objects.185</p>
<p>The above sketch of the mundane path is fairly condensed, but hopefully it is adequate to realize that its goal is the detachment from the coarseness and defilements of all planes of mundane existence, and the acquisition of the five kinds of direct knowledge. These five kinds of knowledge are largely a category of mental powers, which exert control over physical phenomena, mainly through the mastery over the primary elements. As discussed above, the physical body constrains the mind’s agility and movement, but at the same time it is pervaded by the primary elements and their qualities. Once the mind is purified and gains control over the primary elements, it is capable of not only having a full command of the body but also of manipulating external phenomena through the five kinds of direct knowledge.</p>
<p>Although the mundane path is not credited with the potentiality of gaining the state of liberation or <em>nirvāṇa</em>, it is fairly evident that it has the capacity to purify the mind, to free it from the resistance of the gross matter, and to develop psychic powers that hold sway over the forces of nature.</p>
<h3 id="the-transcendent-path">The Transcendent Path</h3>
<p>In the Abhidharma sources, the transcendent path is largely concerned with the process of purification of the mind through the realization of the four noble truths. Its ultimate goal is the attainment of <em>nirvāṇa</em>, which in concrete terms means the termination of recurrent rebirths in physical bodies.186 Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna adepts agree that the mind must be purified, but essentially they focus on the mind’s innate state and its potentiality to mature and develop buddha qualities in the form of buddha mind and body. To phrase it differently, while the adepts of early Buddhism aim to cease existing in phenomenal existence, the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna adepts strive to become Buddhas, in order to benefit all beings in this very world. We do not provide here full expositions of the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna paths, but mainly focus on their treatment of the mind’s nature, and on their ultimate goals.</p>
<p>In one of his canonical discourses the Buddha said: “Monks, the mind is luminosity (<em>prabhāsvara</em>), but it is defiled by adventitious defilements. Monks, the mind is luminosity, and it is freed from adventitious defilements.”187</p>
<p>This statement of the Buddha did not have much impact on the Abhidharma masters, but in the Mahāyāna sources, it forms the conceptual framework for Mahāyāya interpretations of the mind. Briefly stated the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna theories of the mind are rooted in the assumption that the mind is naturally luminous. Let us see some examples of how Mahāyāna texts interpret the mind’s luminosity. In the <em>Pañcaviṃśati</em>, it is said:</p>
<p>This mind (<em>citta</em>) is no-mind (<em>acitta</em>), because its natural character is luminosity. What is the condition of the mind’s luminosity (<em>prabhāsvaratā</em>)? When the mind is neither associated with nor dissociated from greed, hatred, delusion, defilements (<em>anuśaya</em>), and false views (<em>dṛṣṭi</em>), then this constitutes its luminosity. Does the mind exist as no-mind? In the state of no-mind (<em>acittatā</em>), the states of existence (<em>astitā</em>) or non-existence (<em>nāstitā</em>) can be neither found nor asserted. … What is this state of no-mind? The state of no-mind, which is immutable (<em>avikāra</em>) and undifferentiated (<em>avikalpa</em>), constitutes the ultimate reality (<em>dharmatā</em>) of all phenomena. Such is the state of no-mind. Just as the mind is immutable and undifferentiated, in the same way the five aggregates, the twelve bases, the eighteen elements, the dependent origination, the six perfections, the thirty-seven limbs of enlightenment (<em>bodhipakṣika</em>), the attributes of the Buddha (<em>buddhadharma</em>), and the supreme and perfect enlightenment are immutable and undifferentiated.188</p>
<p>In this passage, the mind’s luminosity denotes the mind in the state of no-mind, in the sense that it is immutable and devoid of discursive differentiations, and this constitutes the ultimate reality of all phenomena, including the Buddha attributes and enlightenment.</p>
<p>In the <em>Bhadrapāla-sūtra</em>, the mind is metaphorically compared to the wind element and the sunrays. This text says that although formless and imperceptible, the wind element exists and manifests itself when it shakes trees or blows cold or warm air. It carries pleasant and unpleasant fragrances, but as such it remains stainless and formless. Similarly, although it is formless, the element of consciousness (<em>vijñānadhātu</em>) accomplishes all forms and penetrates all things. Due to its power there arise sensations and volitions, and through them the realm of phenomena (<em>dharmadhātu</em>) classified as wholesome and unwholesome. However, as such consciousness is pure, and although it penetrates all things, it is not clad in them. While it operates through the sense faculties and the five aggregates, it is perceived as defiled, but as such it remains unaffected by bad <em>karma</em>, just as the stainless sunrays remain undefiled by any impurity.189</p>
<p>This <em>sūtra</em> postulates that consciousness generates the realm of phenomena, and that when it is entangled and operates through the defiled aggregates, it is perceived as being defiled. However, as such it is not polluted by defilements, but remains stainless like the wind or the sunrays.</p>
<p>The <em>Laṅkāvatāra-sūtra</em> explicitly equates the buddha-nature (<em>tathāgagarbha</em>) with the store consciousness. It says that the buddha-nature is luminous and pure, and that it is endowed with the thirty-two major marks (<em>lakṣaṇa</em>). It is however disguised in the body of all beings, like a gem wrapped in a dirty piece of cloth. It is enveloped by the aggregates and stained with the impurities of greed, hatred, delusion, and false imagination.190 It holds within itself the cause (<em>hetu</em>) of wholesome and unwholesome things, and it produces all forms of existence (<em>janmagati</em>). Since it is covered with the latent permutations (<em>vāsanā</em>), it is identified with the store consciousness and its retinue of the seven <em>vijñānas</em>.191 It is clear from the above three quotations that in its natural and undefiled condition, the mind is stainless and luminous, and that it encapsulates the potentiality of gaining enlightenment and buddha attributes.</p>
<p>According to the Yoga Tantra, Śākyāmuni Buddha as Siddhārtha attained the supreme enlightenment through the visualization of his mind as a lunar disc (<em>candra</em>), and through a set of five mystical realizations (<em>abhisaṃbodhi</em>).192 Commenting on Siddhārtha’s enlightenment, Indrabhūti provides the following interpretation of the mind as a lunar disc.</p>
<p>Being luminous by nature, this mind is similar to the moon’s disc. The lunar disc epitomizes the knowledge (<em>jñāna</em>) that is luminous by nature. Just as the waxing moon gradually emerges in its fullness, in the same way the mind-jewel (<em>cittaratna</em>), being naturally luminous, also fully emerges in its perfected state. Just as the moon becomes fully visible, once it is freed from accidental obscurities, in the same way the mind-jewel, being pure by nature (<em>prakṛti-pariśuddha</em>), once separated from the stains of defilements (<em>kleśa</em>), it appears as perfected buddha-qualities (<em>guṇa</em>).193</p>
<p>In the <em>tantras</em> the lunar disc essentially denotes a category of mystical light or luminosity. It is from this light that the yogis summon perfected Buddha appearances with which they identify themselves, in order to acquire their buddha-qualities and attributes. Thus viewed together, the above texts do not regard the mind’s luminosity as merely a metaphor, but they firmly consider it to be its innate condition and equate it with buddha-nature and qualities.</p>
<p>In addition to affirming the mind’s luminosity, Mahāyāna masters formulated the concept of <em>bodhicitta</em> (enlightenment-mind), which forms the theoretical framework for Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna paths or practices that culminate in the realization of enlightenment. Fundamentally, the <em>bodhicitta</em> is the seed of buddhahood, the medium or the actual path during the ten bodhisattva stages, and the final product, namely buddhahood.</p>
<p>The <em>bodhicitta</em> is said to incorporate a pair of complementary components, which are called emptiness and compassion, or wisdom and means. The components of emptiness and wisdom denote the perfection of wisdom, and the components of compassion and means encapsulate the other five perfections. The texts also speak of the bodhisattva’s path as an accumulation of merit and knowledge. In this configuration the accumulation of merit consists in the practice of the first five perfections, and the accumulation of knowledge focuses on maturing the perfection of wisdom. The two components of <em>bodhicitta</em> seem to broadly reflect the cognitive and latent aspects of consciousness. Ultimately, the efflorescence of emptiness, wisdom, or knowledge denotes the attainment of enlightenment or <em>dharmakāya</em>; the cognitive process. On the other hand, the practice of compassion, means, and meritorious deeds culminates in the accumulation of a physical buddha-body (<em>rūpakāya</em>); the latent process. Thus, while the defiled consciousness erroneously apprehends the nature of existence and produces <em>karma</em>, which in turn produces mundane bodies, the <em>bodhicitta</em> abides in wisdom and compassion, and strives to mature them in the form of omniscience and buddha-attributes. It is thus the transcendent merit and knowledge that supplant the workings of mundane <em>karma</em> and ignorance.</p>
<p>In the <em>tantras</em>, the <em>bodhicitta</em> is largely interpreted as a mystic experience, which consists in the union or blending (<em>saṃyoga</em>) of wisdom and means, which are identified with a number of specifically <em>tantric</em> pairs such as <em>vajra</em> and bell, or male and female. In some tantric configurations, the <em>bodhicitta</em> is identified with the innate forces circulating within the body in the form of psychic channels (<em>nāḍī</em>) and psychic plexuses (<em>cakra</em>). In some <em>tantras</em> these psychic channels and plexuses are said to constitute the so-called indestructible body (<em>vajradeha</em>), which in some <em>tantras</em> it consists of six components: earth, water, fire, wind, pure consciousness, and emptiness.194 Some <em>tantras</em> explicitly affirm the yogic potentialities of the all-pervasive presence of the primary elements in all beings. Wind is said to have the nature of life breath, fire the nature of life (<em>jīvita</em>), water the nature of immortality, and earth the nature of spatial expanse. The deity within them is consciousness as the supreme lord, who becomes transformed into knowledge in the form of five deities; it abides in the five aggregates as the five kinds of knowledge and as the five cosmic Buddhas.195 Thus, essentially, the <em>tantras</em> emphasize the yogic experience of <em>bodhicitta</em> abiding within the body, although ultimately the character of <em>bodhicitta</em> is described as the inexpressible reality. It has no beginning and no end, it is neither existent nor nonexistent, non-substantial like emptiness and space. Since there is the non-substantiality and sameness of all phenomena, the <em>bodhicitta</em> is unborn, devoid of existence, nondual, <em>vajra</em>, luminosity, enlightenment, and Vajrasattva.196</p>
<p>Like Nāgārjuna, the <em>tantras</em> assert that there is no difference between <em>saṃsāra</em> and <em>nirvāṇa</em>, because both of them are neither produced nor annihilated. Similarly, the nature of the world is identical with the nature of the Tathāgata, because both of them are devoid of any essence. It is said in the <em>Hevajra</em>:</p>
<p>Such as is <em>saṃsāra</em>, such is <em>nirvāṇa</em>. There is no <em>nirvāṇa</em> other than <em>saṃsāra. Saṃsāra</em> consists in the five aggregates, in the sense faculties, in hatred, delusion and the rest. However, all these phenomena are essentially <em>nirvāṇa</em>, and it is only from delusion (<em>moha</em>) that they appear as <em>saṃsāra</em>. The wise man continues in <em>saṃsāra</em>, but this <em>saṃsāra</em> is recognised as <em>nirvāṇa</em>, because he has brought this about by the process of purification. This <em>nirvāṇa</em>, being the <em>bodhicitta</em>, is both absolute and relative in form.197</p>
<p>Anaṅgavajra says that the <em>tantra</em> adepts consider <em>saṃsāra</em> as a condition of the mind veiled by the darkness arising from false ideations and stained with attachment and other impurities. However, once it is liberated from false ideations and impurities, the same mind becomes excellent, and thus <em>nirvāṇa</em> constitutes another condition of the mind when it is bright and luminous.198 Thus, <em>saṃsāra</em> and <em>nirvāṇa</em> are not two different or separate entities, but represent two aspects of the mind. When defiled the mind stands for <em>saṃsāra</em> and when purified it stands for <em>nirvāṇa</em>.</p>
<p>In conclusion some observations may be offered. First, in contrast to the path of early Buddhism, the Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna paths do not abandon <em>saṃsāra</em> (the body). The bodhisattva strives to gain a perfect buddha body in order to teach the dharma in this world. The <em>tantra</em> adepts treat the body as a repository of mystic power and experience. Second, in Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, the focus is on activating and developing the innate potentialities of the mind. The bodhisattva as it were transforms the <em>bodhicitta</em> into buddha bodies (<em>dharmakāya</em> and <em>rūpakāya</em>), and the tantric adepts convert it into mystic experiences within the body and transmute it into the five cosmic Buddhas. Finally, it is not so evident in Mahāyāna, but it is fairly obvious that in the <em>tantras</em>, the mystic potentialities and experiences within the body are stimulated through the activation of the innate energies abiding in the body‒mind complex supported by the primary elements.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Viewed as a whole, this essay offers a broad survey of fire as a natural phenomenon, as a deity, and a mystical energy.</p>
<p>Part One sketches the cosmic, ritual, and mystic character of fire as described in the Vedic and Upaniṣadic sources. As a cosmic force, fire pervades and maintains all phenomena. It is identified with the sun and different forms of light, and with the fire that digests food and maintains the body. In terms of its ritual character, fire as the god Agni acts as a sacrificial priest and conveys human offerings to the gods. In its mystical character, fire is identified with Brahman, the ultimate reality, and with the deathless <em>ātman</em> abiding in human hearts. Although Brahman is formless and invisible, its cosmic and yogic manifestations appear in the form of fire, light, and luminosity. Fire also denotes death and immortality.</p>
<p>Part Two shows how Buddhism reinterprets the Vedic sacrifices, and how the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rites are assimilated into the Buddhist pantheon and tantric rituals. Initially, the Buddha rejects Vedic rituals, but gradually their positive aspects are recast into the Buddhist practice of generosity, and the Buddhist way of striving for the highest sacrifice, namely the state of <em>arhatship</em>. For several centuries the god Agni and <em>homa</em> rites have no place in Buddhism, but with the emergence of esoteric Buddhism, they are adjusted and incorporated into tantric rituals.</p>
<p>Part Three attempts to ascertain the function of the fire element and the other primary elements as part of the Buddhist paths to enlightenment. In the mundane path, the control over the primary elements and their qualities generates a variety of yogic powers, which are encapsulated in the five kinds of direct knowledge. This path does not culminate in enlightenment, but still the acquisition of purity and qualities embedded in the primary phenomena are surely the pinnacle of human attainment and perfection in this world. In the transcendent path, the focus is on the luminosity of consciousness, and on the pristine energies abiding within the body. The <em>bodhicitta</em> abides in the body in the form of luminous consciousness supported by the primary elements. The luminosity of consciousness basically denotes its innate state free from discursive thoughts and mundane entanglements. Broadly speaking, in Buddhist sources, particularly in the <em>tantras</em>, the attributes of the Vedic fire, such as being luminosity, knowledge, and Brahman, are largely reflected in Buddhist interpretations of consciousness as being luminosity, <em>bodhicitta, nirvāṇa</em>, supreme deity, and five cosmic Buddhas. Finally, Buddhism offers a vast repository of teachings on how to gain wisdom and enlightenment, but it seems that in order to acquire them, one has to delve not into books, but into the innate energies and qualities embedded within the body‒mind complex.</p>
