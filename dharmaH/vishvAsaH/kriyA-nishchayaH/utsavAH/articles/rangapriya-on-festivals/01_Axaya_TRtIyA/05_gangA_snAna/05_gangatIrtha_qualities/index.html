  <meta property="og:description" content="A Discussion on the praise of the qualities of Gaṅgatīrtha.
a) A discussion on its capacity to cure diseases
We have already noted scriptural evidences and also the statements of modern physicians based on experiments, which declare that Gaṅgatīrtha has the potential to remove sins and cure physical ailments. Here, some people argue “Only because it has the power to cure bodily ailments and improve health, it is called holy water.” And they comment—“The reason for this belief is the presence of some special chemicals in that water which absorb the bacteria in the water and kill them. The cholera bacteria themselves get dissolved and die in it! The human body is benefited most by the use of this kind of water! That is why our ancestors who understood this, called Gaṅgā holy and attached religious importance to that.” But this is a wrong opinion. Because, many substances prescribed as medicines which fecilitate health and nourishment are prohibited for consumption when one is healthy. And they are not considered sacred just because they are healthy. On the contrary, persons who pursue spirituality seriously are barred from consuming them, when their health is alright.">

  <p>A Discussion on the praise of the qualities of <em>Gaṅgatīrtha</em>.</p>
<p><strong>a) A discussion on its capacity to cure diseases</strong></p>
<p>We have already noted scriptural evidences and also the statements of modern physicians based on experiments, which declare that <em>Gaṅgatīrtha</em> has the potential to remove sins and cure physical ailments. Here, some people argue “Only because it has the power to cure bodily ailments and improve health, it is called holy water.” And they comment—“The reason for this belief is the presence of some special chemicals in that water which absorb the bacteria in the water and kill them. The cholera bacteria themselves get dissolved and die in it! The human body is benefited most by the use of this kind of water! That is why our ancestors who understood this, called <em>Gaṅgā</em> holy and attached religious importance to that.” But this is a wrong opinion. Because, many substances prescribed as medicines which fecilitate health and nourishment are prohibited for consumption when one is healthy. And they are not considered sacred just because they are healthy. On the contrary, persons who pursue spirituality seriously are barred from consuming them, when their health is alright.</p>
<p><strong>For example:-</strong>‘औषधार्थं पिबेन्मद्यम्’ (liquor should be consumed as a medicine) i.e. In some diseases, alchohol should be taken in a certain quantity as medicine. Though recommended as healthy (in exceptional cases), alchohol is not considered as sacred. ŚrīRaṅgamahāguru, a Mahāvaidya, used to say ṝ “Onion and garlic are indeed healthy substances. Raw onion is a good medicine for farmers, who inhale unavoidably dust in the fields. It increases urination and clears the dust collected inside, through urine, and cleans the body. So it is recommended for the farmers, at that time. Garlic removes rheumatism and improves digestion. It is a best remedy for diseases of rheumatism and indigestion.” He also used to caution “But these (onions and garlic) are not helpful for those who pursue spiritual life. So, they should not be consumed by people whose inclination is mainly towards spirituality.” Thereore, it is not correct to say that all those things that contribute to health can annihilate sins. And there is no substance in the argument that <em>Gaṅgā</em> came to be considered as sacred only because of its capacity to cure ailments.</p>
<p>Many ancient and modern physicians have proclaimed by experiments that <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> has the capacity to cure many diseases. But we have to come to a conclusion in this matter only after examining their opinions, and arguments of objections.</p>
<p>Now, argument that the water of <em>Gaṅgā</em> does not cure diseases, but causes diseases: “<em>Gaṅgā</em> is clean only at the place of its origin, and only for a few kilometers further. In all other places, it is a stream of filth and pollution. It’s water is full of filth and it is nothing but an open drain and stinking gutters. It is a godown of bacteria.”</p>
<p>The reasons for these are as follows. Dangerous chemicals and effluents from many industries join <em>Gaṅga</em> river in plenty exereting urine and faces on its banks is common. Animals are washed in those waters. During festivals, thousands of people take bath at the same place, and the dirt of their bodies collects in the river. In pilgrimage centers like <em>Kāśī</em>, half burnt corpses are thrown in abundance into the river, spoiling the water further. Therefore river <em>Gaṅgā</em> is one of the most polluted rivers of our country. Germs which cause typhoid, cholera, gastroeneteritis, hepatitis and tapeworms in the stomach, spread by consuming (drinking) that polluted water.” This is the statement issued by an organization called <em>Gāndhi Śāntipīṭha</em>. A research work in 1976 by physicians has reported that the water of river <em>Gaṅgā</em> is unfit for consumption. We cannot refute this opinion which is based on medical research. But there is also a statement from physicians which says-“Abundant bacteria in the water was noticed by us. But we also noticed that after six hours all the germs had died.” These are opinions that have come up at different times. We need to find out the quality of water only by scientific examination from time to time. Contextually, it has to be noted that generally all rivers are naturally gifted with the property of purifying their waters.</p>
<h3 id="self-purifying-rivers">Self purifying rivers</h3>
<p>The natural capacity of rivers to purify themselves</p>
<p>Generally all rivers naturally purify their water themselves. Scientists explain it in a book (<em>Holasu Tumbida namma nadigalu—BSN)</em> as follows:-In rivers, bacteria which clean water are also present. There are two types of bacteria namely aerobic and anaerobic. Bacteria belonging to the first type thrive on oxygen. The bacteria of the second type abhor vital air and live without oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria destroy the solid substances at the bottom of the stream, and the one of the other variety destroy the substances on the surface of water. And these bacteria devour even organic matter that are present in filthy water. When they enter the body of the bacteria those organic matters get converted into inorganic matter. They wont decay. They cause no harm. Moreover, some of the single cell bacteria present in the water destroy disease causing germs in the filth. “Aerobic bacteria take away the oxygen dissolved in water which is their food. Is it not harmful?”, one may ask. The answer is, even if oxygen is lost like that, the rivers draw oxygen present in the atmosphere to make up for the loss. And also, the algae in the water produce oxygen by photosynthesis, and supply it to the bacteria.</p>
<p>When the organic matter get reduced in the river water, the aerobes get reduced in number because of lack of food. Then the river increases its oxygen content by absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere. But if the amount of filth in the water is too much, the process of purification slows down. Because, the bacteria that devour the organic matter coming with the filth in large numbers, grow in large quantities and empty the oxygen content (in the river). The river by itself cannot make good this enormous loss of oxygen. Then the aerobes and the bacteria-killing single celled organisms, die due to lack of oxygen. Then the entire river becomes a settlement of the aerobes. They get a lot of food, and, oxygen that is inimical to them will also be not present there. Therefore they multiply on the surface of water. In addition to this, they release a foul smelling black coloured toxic gas called hydrogensulphide to water, and render it black and stinking. They cause the vegetation in the river to die. The fish in the water also die because of the lack of sufficient oxygen. And the entire river gets polluted.</p>
<p>This is the capacity of rivers to purify themselves commonly seen. Since <em>Gaṅgā</em> flows across medicinal plants and herbs, its capacity to destroy germs and to purify may be greater. Even then, if the river is dumped with filth all the time beyond a limit, the above purification capability may get weakned.</p>
<h3 id="preview-of-the-argument">Preview of the argument</h3>
<p>Simply because river <em>Gaṅgā</em> is getting overpolluted and becoming an abode of diseases due to our own thoughtlessness, it does not mean that the statement that <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> is by itself is disease-resistant and health-promoting is untrue. If unwise persons mix poison with nectar like milk and meet with death, it does not go to falsify the statement that milk by itself is nectar like.</p>
<p>It is an act of great sin to pollute river waters with sewage. Even while bathing in the rivers, we should not let our body dirt into them. Bath should be taken elsewhere and, with a pure body and mind, one should take a dip in river waters with the feeling that it is a sacred water flowing from the holy feet of the Lord. While proclaiming these words, we feel horripilated to remember the great value attached to the purification of river water by our <em>śāstras</em>. We should decry ourselves for the heinous act of letting various filths into the waters of great rivers without an iota of hesitation! This is indeed the result of deviating from the dos and don’ts prescribed by <em>jnānis</em>, and it is nothing but the crookedness of the mind to add filth to the flow of river waters, advancing the ruse that the rivers are gifted with the capacity to purify themselves. Rivers by themselves remove the filth accumulated unavoidably. But the offence of adding filth to them should not be commited from our side. It is not wrong to cleanse and purify polluted rivers scientifically without causing damage to their properties. It should necessarily be taken up even if it may cost much, as the great benefit of health is obtained thereby.</p>
<p>A story goes like this-Someone said that sewage should not be let into the <em>Gaṅgā</em> and dead bodies should not be thrown into its waters. Goddess <em>Gaṅgā</em> appeared in their dream and said-“Why do you insult my greatness? Have you no belief in the fact that I have the capacity to destroy any filth of any quantity? You have no right to tell that filth or dead bodies should not be let into my waters” The truth of this story is worth discussing. This goes against the principle that we have to take a holy bath in a river and not the mere bath that removes dirt from the body. It is common sense to know that a holy great river which is to be worshipped as a goddess should not be polluted, either with body filth or with the filth of mind. We can see that as a rule, even idols of gods are cleaned before giving them a bath and then they are given an <em>Abhisheka</em> with <em>pañcāmṛta</em> and <em>śuddhodaka</em>. When we look at this, it can be understood that it is not wrong to purify scientifically and consume the waters of rivers, which are like deities.</p>
<p>To conclude, it can be said that the water of <em>Gaṅgā</em> by itself, has the special capacity to cure ailments. This matter has been established by experiments. We should profit from this god given gift. But it is a great sin to deliberately add poison to this nectar and commit an offence against divinity and the living beings, who use its water. It should be given up. We should safeguard the purity of this great river which is a gift of god and accomplish our purity also.</p>
<ol>
<li>The argument that <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> has the capacity to cure illness, is just an idea of sentimental origin.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer: <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> has an uncommon ability to cure diseases. In the <em>Mānasasarovaratīrtha,</em> which is it’s origin, and in its tributaries such as <em>Alakanandā</em>, <em>Mandākinī</em> and also in the great water streams of <em>Gaṅgā</em> which is formed by the confluence of the above rivers, there exists a potential to cure indigestion, sloth, some types of fever and some contagious diseases, and the water of <em>Gaṅgā</em> is a nourishing drink. These facts have been established by the experiments of many physicians. But one Dr. Kovoor of recent times, has stated that there is nothing special about <em>Gaṅgātīrtha,</em> and he states that this is proved by his experience. He gives an example of an incident that occurred in his life.</p>
<p>“When I set out for Kolkata from Kerala for further studies, Hindus in my village had requested me to bring the holy water from <em>Gaṅgā</em>. But on reaching Calcutta, it was nauseating to see the dirty water of <em>Gaṅgā</em>. My conscience did not agree to give this water to the devout people, which could cause diseases from germs. On my return journey from Kolkata, I took some water from a well in a railway station near my village and gave it to the village people telling them that it is the holy <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> which was requested for. Many people who drank that water came to me and shared their experiences.—“We are grateful to you. Just by drinking a few drops of that <em>Gaṅgātīrtha,</em> my chronic illness vanished. My sister also was relieved of such and such an evil.” So it can be established that, the above said cure became possible only by faith cure and there is nothing special about <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em>. Because, I had not given them the real <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> at all” This has been put forth by him as a proof (Be gone Godmen)</p>
<p>We do not say that the incident quoted by him is untrustworthy. But the conclusion drawn by him is unscientific because, he has not stated what exactly was the effect of consuming <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em>. The only thing that is conveyed by the incident is that a good effect was the result because some well water was consumed with the faith that it was <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em>. So, <em>Gaṅgā</em> came to be invoked in some (ordinary) water, with a full faith that it was <em>Gaṅgā</em>, though it was actually not <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em>. Thus, the fact that there is great power even in sentimental <em>Gaṅgā</em>, has become loudly clear.</p>
<p>In reality, <em>Gaṅgā</em> and other <em>tīrthas</em> are present within us. <em>Jnānis</em> enjoy bliss by immersing themselves in that internal <em>Gaṅgā</em>. The scriptures of <em>maharshis</em> declare that the external holy waters (<em>tīrthas</em>) are instrumental in taking ordinary people to the internal <em>tīrthas</em>. “आत्मैव सर्वतीर्थानि”, “यः स्नाति मानसे तीर्थे स याति परमां गतिम्”, “त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा.”</p>
<p><em>Śāstras</em> have prescribed in our <em>Nityakarmavidhi</em> itself, that <em>Gaṅgā</em> should be invoked in any water used for bathing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>इमं मे गङ्गे यमुने सरस्वति, शुतद्रि स्तोमं सचता परुष्णिया ।<br>
असिक्निया मरुद्वृधे वितस्तयार्जीकीये शृणु ह्यासुषोमया ॥(महानारायण)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>गङ्गे च यमुने चैव गोदावरि सरस्वति ।<br>
नर्मदे सिन्धु कावेरि जलेऽस्मिन् सन्निधिं कुरु ॥</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, drinking of even sentimental <em>Gaṅgā</em> (water) can help in the curing of diseases. We have noted previously, that not only sentimental devotees but even discriminating scientists, and people with first hand experience have stated that actual <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> has even more potential in that regard. It is our responsibility to maintain the holy water of <em>Gaṅgā</em> in the natural state and use it for the curing of both mental and physical ailments.</p>
<h3 id="the-redemptive-power">The redemptive power</h3>
<p>The redemptive power of <em>Gaṅgā:</em> An explanation</p>
<p>Let us agree for the moment that clean <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> when consumed, can cure diseases. But how to believe that it has redemptive power? Doing worship of God and following the path of <em>dharma</em> is known to redeem one’s sins. How can it happen just by drinking water from a river? If sins are redeemed just by drinking water, then the fish, crocodiles and other acquatic creatures that always live in water must be more blessed than human beings, isn’t it? This question naturally arises here. The answer for this can be found by recollecting what Śrīraṅgamahāguru had expounded about the meaning of pāpa and puṇya.</p>
<p><em>Pāpa</em> and <em>Puṇya</em> are <em>samskāras</em> that are imprinted on the gramophone plate of the mind. The marks which cause misery or misfortunes are called sins and the marks that lead to happiness are called <em>puṇya</em>.</p>
<p>The marks of sins disturb the mind, make it impure and cause agitation. They incense the <em>dhātus</em> and cause anger in the mind. The impressions of <em>puṇya</em> generate waves which dissipate agitation and impurity, and help to attain a state of happiness.</p>
<p>One who has <em>samskāras</em> of sins may appear healthy outside, but his <em>dhātus</em> remain irritated in the inner layers of his nature. When this agitation within is gone and tranquility prevails, it can be understood that the marks of evil have vanished and sins are removed. It is established by experiment that when holy <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> is taken with the right disposition mind, the above said effect takes place. When a person sees holy <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em>, takes a holy dip in it and drinks that sacred water, the abnormal nature vanishes and the tranquility of <em>dhātus</em> manifests. This can be clearly known by those who are in the path of self realization and the ones who possess the knowledge of the body and corporeal science.</p>
<p>This effect will be there even on ordinary people, at least in small proportions. When this pleasantness of <em>dhātus</em> is accomplished completely, then the very realization of <em>Brahman</em> occurs as proclaimed by the <em>Upanishads</em> in the words “धातुप्रसादत् महिमनमीशम्.” Just as the above said result (i.e. the pleasantness of <em>dhātus</em>) happens from <em>tapas</em> and meditation etc., it also happens in a measure, by drinking the holy <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em>. And that is why it is valued greatly. Thus, as the drinking of the holy <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> causes attainment of the <em>brahmī</em> state, it may be called a destroyer of sins, without any doubt.</p>
<h3 id="mechanism-of-sin-removal">Mechanism of sin-removal</h3>
<p>The ways in which the taking of <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> results in the removal of sins.</p>
<p>A) Drinking of <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> causes the removal of ailments and thereby becomes instrumental in the tranquility of the self. Only a healthy person indeed can meditate well says an ayurvedic aphorism.</p>
<p>“अनामयी यावदात्मानं सम्मन्यते”</p>
<p>Ill health is unnatural and a stronger. It is surely a result of sin. The holy water that removes sins should be indeed called a redeemer. Ill health is the fruit of sins committed during previous lives. <em>Āyurveda</em> states “पूर्वजन्मकृतं पापं व्याधिरूपेण बाधते.” The modern medical science has clearly demonstrated that diseases are caused by bacteria. Then, is it not blind faith to say that ill health is a result of sins?-To come to a judgment on a matter without pondering over it right from its origin, is also blind faith. It is not wrong to say that bacteria causes diseases. But to conclude that bacteria alone are the root cause for all diseases is not correct. They happen to be the cause in the intermediate phase. Bacteria can cause illness only when our body becomes weak due to the imbalance caused by <em>Vāta, pitta</em> and <em>kapha</em> in our system. They cannot cause any disease in the body of a person who possesses a state of balanced <em>dhātus</em> and who is robust. Bacteria of the same type and same number, can cause diseases to some, and cannot cause diseases to some others. Therefore the root cause of diseases is the rage (imbalance) of <em>dhātus</em> in our body system. <em>Āyurveda</em> says that the marks that cause the imbalance are nothing but sins and so, sins are responsible for diseases. Thus, <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> which is capable of correcting the unevenness in dispositions and removing ailments, is indeed the redeemer of sins.</p>
<p>The <em>Himālayas</em> abound in medicinal plants, herbs and mountain born minerals. It is natural that <em>Gaṅgā</em> which flows across all these, has the power to cure ailments.</p>
<p>B) <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> relieves one of sloth and infuses spiritual inspiration. It brings about great happiness of the mind. The cognizance of this comes to the mind only because the marks of sins get washed away.</p>
<p>c) The blemishes which distort the mind are called sins. How <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> is capable of removing them, has to be discussed here.</p>
<p>As the Holy <em>Gaṅgātīrtha</em> has had the contact of sacred most people, it brings to our mind sacred memories. “Lord <em>Rudra deva</em> performed penance in <em>Rudraprayāg</em> a on the banks of the holy <em>Gaṅgā</em>, regularly drinking its water. <em>Nara</em> and <em>Nārāyaṇa</em> (<em>Arjuna</em> and Lord <em>Kṛshṇa</em>), did <em>tapasyā</em> in the hermitages on the banks of this <em>Gaṅgā</em> river consuming this <em>tīrtha</em> regularly. They performed fire sacrifices at a place called <em>Daśāśvamedha</em> on its banks. The seven <em>ṛshis</em> perform rituals in its water Great sages like <em>Nārada, Vyāsa</em>, and <em>Vālmīki</em> have consumed its holy water.”—When such holy memories come to our mind, bad impressions vanish.</p>
<h3 id="divine-and-grand-reminiscences">Divine and grand reminiscences.</h3>
<p>A holy dip in <em>Gaṅgā</em> brings to our memory all that has been said in the holy <em>Vedas, purāṇas</em>, history and great literary works based on them, which describe the holy bath, the holy men and the power of <em>Gaṅgā</em>. These reminiscences will erase all the sinful <em>samskāras</em> in our dispositions and purify our mind, intellect and senses.</p>
<p>For example, in the beginning of OM it adorned the water pot of Lord <em>Brahma</em>.</p>
<p>‘आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलम्’ It is the sacred water that flowed from the holy feet of Lord <em>Vishṇu.</em> “पश्चात्पन्नगशायिनो भगवतः पादोदकं पावनम्” “विष्णुपादोद्भवा गङ्गा” “विष्णुपादात्परिभ्रष्टं प्लावयित्वेन्दुमण्डलम्” “तत्र भगवतः साक्षाद्यज्ञलिङ्गस्य विष्णोर्विक्रमतो वामपादाङ्गुष्ठनखनिर्भिन्नोर्ध्वाण्डकटाहविवरेणान्तः प्रविष्टा या बाह्यजलधारा. . . . साक्षाद्भगवत्पदीति’ “अथाङ्घ्रये प्रोन्नमिताय विष्णोः उपाहरत्पद्मभुवोऽर्हणादिकम्” “धातुः कमण्डलुजलं तदुरुक्रमस्य” “पादावनेजन पवित्रतया नरेन्द्र” “स्वर्धुन्यभून्नभसि सा पतिता निर्मार्ष्टि” “लोकत्रयं भगवतो विशदेव कीर्तिः” It is the holy <em>tīrtha</em> that found a blessed abode in the knot of har (on top of the head) of the Lord of Lords <em>(Śiva)</em></p>
<p>“भूयो शम्भुजटाविभूषणमणिः” ‘भवाङ्गपतितं तोयं पवित्रमिति पस्पृशुः” “निपपात ततो गङ्गा धन्ये शिवशिरस्युत” “नैव सा निर्गमं लेभे जटामण्डलमोहिता” “तच्छङ्करशिरोभ्रष्टं भ्रष्टं भूमितले पुनः । व्यरोचत तदा तोयं निर्मलं गतकल्मषम्” “It is the holy <em>tīrtha</em> that came out of the opening of the ear of <em>Jahnuṛshi</em>.” “ततो हि यजमानस्य जह्नोरद्भुतकर्मणः । ततस्तुष्टो महातेजाः श्रोत्राभ्यामसृजत्पुनः” It is the holy water which incarnated on the earth as a result of the grace of god bestowed on <em>Bhagīratha</em> for his penance. “इयं च दुहिता श्रेष्ठा तव गङ्गा भविष्यति” गङ्गा त्रिपथगा नाम दिव्या भागीरथीति च”</p>
<p>We come across such sayings in the stories of *Gaṅgā’*s descent (to earth). Among these, Lord <em>Brahma</em> is the divine entity, who keeps on performing the work of, creation while he remains unchanged.</p>
<p>एतन्मतं समातिष्ठ परमेण समाधिना । भवान्कल्पविकल्पेषु न विमुह्यति कर्हिचित्” ॥ “सर्वभूतमयो विश्वं ससर्जेदं स पूर्ववत्” <em>Mahāvishṇu</em> is the changeless supreme <em>Brāhmaṇ</em>. “अविकाराय शुद्धाय नित्याय परमात्मने । सदैकरूपरूपाय विष्णवे सर्वजिष्णवे” Mahādeva is <em>Parameśvara</em> (Lord of Lords). “विष्णुर्यथैकः पुरुषोत्तमः स्मृतः महेश्वरस्त्र्यम्बक एव नापरः” Sage <em>Jahnu</em> is a <em>Brahmīshṭha</em> who is absorbed in the bliss of meditation in the matted hair of Lord <em>Mahādeva. Bhagīratha</em> is a <em>Rājarshi</em> who by his highly astonishing penance visualized the Lord of lords, and caused the holy contact of <em>Gaṅgā</em> to his manes, to himself, and also to the world. When the flow of sentiments concerned with these great personages makes movement within us, the evil marks viz. the sins, dwelling in our dispositions get undoubtedly washed out.</p>
<h3 id="the-holy-water-used-by-great-men">The holy water used by great men.</h3>
<p>From times immemorial many <em>Brahmajnānis</em>, <em>Satyakāmas, Satyasaṅkalpas</em> and <em>Siddhas</em> have taken a holy dip in this river. They, who are holy by themselves, in the pretext of making a pilgrimage to <em>Gaṅgā</em>, have consumed its water and enhanced its holiness. With the words “May the sins of those who take this water (with devotion) vanish,” they have added their divine will power to it. Because of this power also, the sins of people who take it persish,—“भवद्विधा भागवतास्तीर्थभूताः स्वयं विभो । तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि स्वान्तस्थेन गदाभृता” “प्रायेण तीर्थाभिगमापदेशैः स्वयं हि तीर्थानि पुनन्ति सन्तः” ।</p>
