Ten year ago on this day - 06th Janauary 2014 - One of the finest judgments concerning Hindu Communities' fundamental rights to administer and maintain their temples was delivered by Hon'ble Justice B.S. Chauhan and Hon'ble Justice S.A. Bobde in  Hon'ble Supreme Court  of India. The judgment while established or rather re-established the fundamental religious and administrative rights of the ancient community of  Podhu Dikshitars of Chidambaram Sri Nataraja Temple -  also enunciated when, if at all, a Hindu Temple's administration can be taken over and for how long.

Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down the law in this regard  in Dr. Subramanian Swamy vs State of Tamil Nadu as follows: 

1.  The administration of a temple can be taken over only in case of serious mismanagement.
2. The takeover should be only for curing the evil of mismanagement 
3.  Once the evil is remedied, the management must be immediately handed over back to the persons concerned. 
4.  Takeover can be only for a limited period. 
5.  The order of appointment of an Executive Officer without mentioning the circumstances that necessitated the appointment and/or the period for which such appointment is made -  would be ex-facie arbitrary, illegal and just. 
 
Going by the above dictum of Supreme Court - 99% of all our temples should be free of State Government Control. 

State Govts are keeping mum on Hindu Rights.  They are doing everything they can to deny these rights. 

But Central Govt -   run by @BJP4India has not even filed a reply in Supreme Court in Swamy Dayananda Saraswatiji's case -  in spite of the Court giving it many opportunities - So much so for the Hindutva chest thumping  party.

Hindus, for this great Chidambaram Temple Case victory,   should sincerely thank 

1. Dr. @Swamy39 - the champion of Hindu causes
2. Senior Counsel Shri C.S. Vaidyanathan -  Counsel extraordinaire - who represented Lord Ram in Ayodhya Case (and secured victory there as well)
3. Senior Counsel Shri R Venkatramani -  A great  Lawyer respected across the nation and now the nation's Attorney General 

Footnote: 

Some frauds in @tnhrcedept
 stooped to the level of STEALING  Rs.15.00 lakhs from the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Common Good Fund and    Rs. 5.00 Lakhs from Sri Kapaliswarar Temple, Mylapore, Chennai - to illegally pay Court expenses for their case against Chidambaram Dikshitars before Hon'ble Supreme Court -  yet they failed.  The officials who planned and arranged the stealing of Temple funds should go to jail. 

That's another interesting story.  I shall do a detailed thread on that later.
