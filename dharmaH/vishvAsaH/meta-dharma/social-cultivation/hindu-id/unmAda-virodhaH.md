## शाङ्कराः
Plenty of advaitin type schools are syncretic, eg. rAmakRShNamaTha, yogananda's srf, argentina hastinApur foundation etc..

Monotheism/ Islam friendliness - (notes panchAyatana pUjA etc. and compares to aniconic sulla practices) - [TW](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/177BLLc84R/)

> Most Kashmiri Pandit rituals still don’t involve idols. Instead, we use tantric symbols, a kalash, or even small terracotta plates during pooja. The first step is pran pratishtha — invoking divine presence — after which these objects are worshipped as the dev and devi.  Pic 1: A tantric symbol, similar to the one shown in the Baramulla movie. Pic 2: The Kalash represents Bhairav, while the remaining symbols represent Shiv Ganas. A tantric design made with rice flour on the left is an essential element. Pic 3: The Sapta Matrikas are represented by seven terracotta plates filled with kheer, with simple threads acting as their red attire. 

(Likely an adaptation to hard times like muslim rule. They have farsi stotras and all.)

## वैष्णवाः
vaiShNavism is not monotheistic (all-gods-are-same-advaitism is that) - more monolatrous: [YT](https://youtu.be/4QQ-DhoYE-8?t=742)

Note that they are at the forefront of anti-M resistence there. (note who's jailed in TSB/ bdesh).  
Ditto with maNipur vaiShNavas vs the pretas, and assam vaiShNava sattras vs both u2 and u3.
