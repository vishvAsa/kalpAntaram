## General abrahamism
Abrahamisms fully approve of the famous 10 commandments, two of which are -

> I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me.
>
> You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me, but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.

## Islam
Shahada - 

> 'lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāh' ("There is no deity except God"),   
> 'muḥammadun rasūlu llāh' ("Muhammad is the Messenger of God")

All muslims from ancient to modern times agree that this has full approval and acceptance of muhammad. Further, Muhammad famously destroyed 300 idols in mecca etc.. There is no doubt in Islamic doctrine about there being only one God, and that he should be worshipped aniconically only.
