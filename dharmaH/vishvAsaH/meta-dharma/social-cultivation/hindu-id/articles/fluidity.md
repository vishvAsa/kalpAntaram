the whole issue of "no hindu identity" always seemed kinda silly to me, obviously when no such thing as christianity or islam exist, your divisions are going to be vaishnava vs shaiva. when larger, more strange, more alien groups come in the picture, your group identity expands. When people try to seek fixed identities etched in stone through the centuries, its irritating. i dont know why people cannot understand group identity is fluid, and not static.
