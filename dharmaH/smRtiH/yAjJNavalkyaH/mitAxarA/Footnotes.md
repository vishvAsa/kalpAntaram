[^26]:
     Before kiṃ ca, NSP and Pāṇḍeya add divye sādhāraṇavidhiḥ |

[^27]:
     This is NSm 1.24. Not ascribed to Viṣṇu even in the DhKo.

[^28]:
     Kṛtyakalpataru, Dāna 10.13 (Brick's ed.) ascribed there to Dāna-Bṛhaspati

[^29]:
     NSP and Pāṇḍeya add here a parenthetical statement, which was probably intended to explain the citation: (niyogam anatikramya yathāniyogaṃ, niyogādhīno yo dharmo devarāc ca sutotpattir ityādiḥ sa no bhavati) | It is omitted in Setlur's edition.

[^30]:
     For this maxim, see Jacob, _A Handful of Popular Maxims _(Bombay 1907), Part I, p. 29.

[^31]:
     Here NSP and Pāṇḍeya add: gautamaḥ, as if this citation is from the GDh, but it is not. Omitted by Seltur.

[^32]:
     NSP and several mss (see Seltur, p. 690) read: dvitīyaḥ.

[^33]:
     See previous note.

[^34]:
     NSP reads wrongly: yoīśvareṇa.

[^35]:
     Pāṇḍeya: tat kim.

[^36]:
     Pāṇḍeya: -yukte.

[^37]:
     NSP reads: caure daṇḍam.

[^38]:
     NSP and Pāṇḍeya read: manusmaraṇāt. Probably an error; Setlur gives one ms. with that reading.

[^39]:
     NSP and Pāṇḍeya read: jyeṣṭhaḥ; I follow Seltur. The compound is the only grammatical possibility.

[^40]:
     NSP reads: kasya brahmacāry.

[^41]:
     NSP: liṅgavivakṣitam

[^42]:
     All editions read "manuḥ" here, but the cited text is ascribed to "smṛtyantara" Further, the Mit never simply uses the nominative "manuḥ" to introduce a verse; it is always "āha manuḥ". I think the word here should be "nanu", introducing the pūrvapakṣa, to which a response is given several lines down with "ucyate".

[^43]:
     Seltur omits: ca.

[^44]:
     In NSP and Pāṇḍeya, there is an introductory statement: evaṃ ca tiryaktvād uttīrṇānāṃ mānuṣye rogādilakṣaṇāṇi bhavantīty āha | And "kiṃ ca" is given as part of the commentary. Since this is unusual, I think Seltur is right in taking this as the introduction. He notes that the longer sentence is found only in a single manuscript.

[^45]:
     In place of the actual commentary, NSP mistakenly puts here part of the commentary on 3.213: hīnajātau hemakārākhyāyāṃ pakṣijātau pararatnādyapahārako jāyate | nirjale deśe brahmarākṣaso bhūtaviśeṣo jāyate |

[^46]:
     NSP reads: -ābhyāsād.

[^47]:
     The verse within parentheses is probably an insertion into the GDh passage. But it is given by all three editions.

[^48]:
     This endings are given only in NSP and Pāṇḍeya; omitted by Seltur. I have placed them within parentheses. They may have been inserted by the editors of the NSP.

[^49]:
     Before this the NSP and Pāṇḍeya adds a passage within parentheses that is found in one ms. It is probably an interpolation: (vikraye yad vrataṃ proktaṃ haraṇe dviguṇaṃ hi tat | surāvikraye somye catuṣṭayaṃ lākṣālavaṇamāṃsamadhvājyatilahomānāṃ cāndrāyaṇatrayaṃ payaḥpāyasāpūpadadhīkṣurasaguḍakhaṇḍādisnehapakvādiṣu parākaḥ | siddhānnavikraye prājāpatyaṃ | panasasya tridinaṃ | kadalīnārikerajambīrabījapūrakanāraṅgānāṃ pādakṛcchraṃ | kastūrikāvikraye gandhānāṃ ca kṛcchraṃ | karpūre 'rdhaṃ hiṃgvādivikraye dinam upavāsaḥ | śuklakṛṣṇapītavastravikraye tridinaṃ | ajānām aindavaṃ | kharāśvatarakarabhāṇāṃ parākaḥ | śunāṃ dviguṇaṃ | ekāhād vedavikraye cāndraṃ | aṅgānāṃ parākaḥ | smṛtīnāṃ kṛcchraṃ | itihāsapurāṇānāṃ sāṃtapanaṃ | rahasyānāṃ kṛcchraṃ | gāthānāṃ śiśirātattvavidyānāṃ pādaṃ |)

[^50]:
     Before this NSP and Pāṇḍeya add a passage within parentheses, which is omitted by Seltur. The passage in question is probably an interpolation: (anulomavyavāye garbhe dviguṇaṃ yadi sā atidūṣitā na pratilomagā bhavati tadaiva | anyajātigamane dvaiguṇyaṃ pratilomadūṣitāsu antyāvasāyistrīṣu ca cāṇḍālīgarbhe yathā gurutalpatvaṃ tathā kiṃcin nyūnaṃ tāratamyaṃ kalpyam | cāṇḍālīgamane vārṣikam | garbhe gurutalpatvaṃ tathaiva jñeyam |)

[^51]:
     NSP reads: manuvacanam.

[^52]:
     NSP and Pāṇḍeya add here a passage within parentheses: (citibhraṣṭā tu yā nārī mohādvicalitā kvacit | prājāpatyena śudhyet tu tasmād evāpakarmaṇaḥ || citibhraṣṭā bhartur anugamane āpastambasmaraṇāt kvacid ity uktam |) This is omitted by Seltur.

[^53]:
     NSp and Pāṇḍeya omit: kiṃ ca.
