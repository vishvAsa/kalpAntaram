*   YDh _mūla_ (root-text)- **BOLD**
*   Names of authors and texts- RED
*   Citations from other texts- BLUE
*   Pūrvapakṣa and Uttarapakṣa- <u>underlined</u>
*   Introductory comments that precede the _mūla _verses are given in _Italics_.
*   Words of YDh verse in the commentary are given in bold (but only partially)
*   There are no hyphens used, unless absolutely necessary for an overly long compound. Lack of hyphens should help with word searches.
*   The transcription was prepared from the Nirnaya Sagar Press edition. In checking the transcription and preparing the edition, I used two other editions- Pāṇḍeya's edition in Kashi Sanskrit Series 178, and S. S, Setlur's edition of 1912. Pāṇḍeya's appears to be based on the NSP. The best is Setlur's, which also includes two subcommentaries, _Subodhinī_ and _Bālambhaṭṭī_.
*   One regular change from the NSP is that Vijñāneśvara almost always has an introduction to each verse. Most often this consists of a substantive sentence. But frequently, the introduction consists of two brief introductions- _kiṃ ca_, _api ca_, and infrequently _tathā ca_. NSP and Pāṇḍeya place these in the commentary after the verse. This is an error. You will find that these are found _only_ when there is no substantive introduction. Setlur is the only one who understood this; he places these connective phrases _before_ the verse. So do I.
*   I have tried to eliminate errors and typos, and to make the text user friendly. To that end, I have sometimes eliminated external sandhi and often introduced punctuation. There are certainly still numerous typos and errors. Kindly inform me or Don Davis so that we may correct them.
