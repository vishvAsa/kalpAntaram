‘*Imbued with faith*’—the pupil who is devoted, having his innermost
soul imbued with trust in the scriptures.

‘*Excellent learning*,’—*i.e*., the science of reasoning as propounded
in the Nyāya-śāstra, etc.; or, it may mean ‘that which duly shines,’
*i.e*., good poetry and poetics as propounded by Bharata and other
writers; or, it may mean the ‘science of incantations,’ which is of no
use regarding *Dharma*.

Such learning one might ‘*acquire*’—learn—‘*even from the lowly
person*,’—*i.e*., from a person born of a lower caste. ‘*excellent
learning*’ here should not be taken as the ‘Vedic Science’; for even
though in abnormal times of distress the learning of the Veda from lower
castes may be permitted—as we shall find later on (Verse 241), yet it
cannot be permitted in normal times. That learning which is ‘*not
excellent*,’—such as the science of magic, etc.—one should not learn at
all.

‘*Lowest*’ is the Cāṇḍāla; from him even, one may learn the ‘*special
law*,’—*i.e*., law other than that expounded in *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis;
i.e*., law relating to ordinary worldly matters. The term ‘*dharma*,’
‘*law*,’ is also used in the sense of *rule*. The sense thus is that—if
even a Cāṇḍāla should say—‘such is the rule here,’—‘do not stay here for
long,’—‘do not bathe in this water,’—‘such is the custom among the
people of the village,’—‘such is the restriction imposed by the
king,’—then one should not think that he should obey only the words of
his Preceptor and he need not pay any heed to those of a *Cāṇḍāla* who
has dared to advise him.

We should not take the term ‘special law’ to mean ‘the knowledge of
truth regarding Brahman’; because it is not possible to acquire this
knowledge from the Cāṇḍāla and such people, for the simple reason that
they are ignorant of the Veda; and from no other source such knowledge
can be derived; specially as the teaching of Brahman is not like the
teaching of incantations for the cure of scorpion-bite, etc.

‘*Gem of a wife*,’—the wife who is like a gem; the compound being based
upon similitude, according to Pāṇini 2.1.56; or, it may be explained
according to Pāṇini 2.1.57 (the meaning being the ‘gem-like wife’). If
the term ‘gem’ be taken in the sense *of any good thing*, then the
compound is according to 2.1.57; if, on the other hand, the term ‘*gem*’
be taken as standing only for the emerald, the ruby and other precious
stones,—and it is applied to other things only on account of their
*excellence*, in which they resemble precious stones,—then the compound
would fall under 2.1.56. The meaning is that if a girl happens to be
possessed of a well-formed figure and a charming complexion, and she
happens to bear auspicious signs indicative of the possession of much
wealth in cash and kind, and the possibility of bearing many children
and so forth,—then she should be married, even though she belong to a
‘*base family*,’—a family wanting in the due performance of religious
acts, etc.

This forms an introduction to what is going to be enjoined under 241 *et
seq*. (in connection with abnormal times); and what is here permitted is
only when other sources are not available.—(238)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Param dharmam*’—‘Special law, *i*. *e*., law other than that expounded
in the *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis*; *i.e*., that relating to ordinary worldly
matters’ (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Rāghavānanda);—‘the means of
obtaining final liberation’ (Kullūka), which view is noted and rejected
by Medhātithi.

‘*Duṣkulādapi*’—‘Family wanting in the due perfohnance of religious
acts’ (Medhātitlii);—‘Family lower than one’s own’ (Kullūka);—‘Family of
a potter or such other low castes’ (Govindarāja).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 514) in support of
the view that learning may be acquired even from persons of lower
grades;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 144);—and in *Saṃskāramayūkha*

The preceding verse as well as these two verses (239 and 240) are
supplementary to the injunction contained in verse 241.

The present verse cites an ordinary saying in support of the injunction.
Ordinary people say that ‘good may be taken even out of evil.’ If there
is nectar in poison, that should be taken in the same manner as the swan
takes the milk out of water. This is said in reference to certain
medicinal preparations which contain poisonous ingredients.

Even if a child should happen to say something good,—if be pronounces,
for instance, some auspicious words at the time of one’s starting for a
journey,—it should be accepted.

‘*Even from a foe*’—one should learn —‘*good conduct*,’—*i.e*., of
cultured behaviour; and it would not be right to shun such behaviour
simply because it happens to be followed by one’s enemy.

The next instance is still more well known—‘*gold may be taken even from
an impure source*.’

The sense of all this is tbat just as the good things herein enumerated
are accepted even from evil sources, so may learning be acquired even
from a non-Brāhmaṇa.—(239)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse contains the injunction.

The ‘*difficulty*’ here meant is *the absence of a teacher*. The
compound ‘*āpatkālaḥ*’ is to be expounded as ‘*āpadaḥ kalaḥ*,’ ‘*time of
difficulty*.’ What is meant to be expressed being obtained from the term
‘*difficulty*’ alone, the additional term ‘*time*’ only serves to fill
up the metre.

‘*Āpatkalpe*’ is another reading. The meaning in this case would be tbat
the ‘*kalpa*,’ ‘*kalpana*,’ *assumption*, of these is permitted during
difficulties.

If the preceptor, after having begun the course of teaching, should
happen, either on account of an expiatory rite or of some other reason,
to abandon the pupil and go to another place,—and no other
Brāhmaṇa-teacher is available,—and the pupil himself being too young, is
unable to go to another place,—then he may receive teaching even from a
non-Brāhmaṇa; *i.e*., from the *Kṣatriya*, and in his absence, from the
Vaiśya. In view of the context, which began with the mention of the
‘learning of the entire Veda’ (165), the ‘*learning*’ here enjoined is
the *getting up of the Veda*.

Though the term ‘*non-Brāhmaṇa*’ denoting all the three castes, except
the Brāhmaṇa, stands for *all men*, yet the *Śūdra* could not be meant
here; for the *Śūdra* is not entitled to learn the Veda; and it is only
when one has *learnt* something that he can *teach* it.

“But by transgressing the scriptural ordinance, the Śūdra also might
learn the Veda, just as the Kṣatriya and the Vaiśya do the work of
teaching (which is not permitted).”

This also cannot be; because it has been laid down that if the *Śūdra*
happens to learn the Veda, his body should be cut up. And since the
penalty is so severe, it follows that the act is a grievous sin; and one
who commits a grevious sin is regarded as ‘fallen’; so that if the
Religious Student associated with a ‘fallen’ person, he would render
himself extremely defiled.

“But the act of teaching has been prohibited for the Kṣatriya and the
Vaiśya also; so that the same guilt would be incurred in their case.”

There is a difference between the two cases. That act is to be regarded
as extremely heinous in connection with which the scriptures prescribe
heavy penalties and expiation; while that in connection with which the
penalty and expiation prescribed are slight, should be regarded as
slight. In connection with the work of teaching done by the *Kṣatriya*
and the *Vaiśya*, the penalty and expiation laid down are not heavy, as
they are in the case of the *Śūdra*. Further, in the case of the
*Śūdra*, there would he two prohibited acts—that of *learning* the Veda,
and that of *teaching* it; while in the case of the *Kṣatriya*, there is
only one,—that of *teaching*. Then, as regards the pupil associating
with one who does the work of teaching in contravention of the law,—such
associating h as been permitted by the present verse itself; hence it
cannot be regarded as leading to defilement; for associating with the
Śūdra, who learns the Veda in contravention to law, on the other hand,
there is no authority at all.

‘*Anuvrajyā* *ca śuśrūṣā*,’ ‘*service the shape of following*’;—this is
meant to prohibit such service as *saluting, washing the feet*, and so
forth.

‘*During the course of study*’;—*i.e*., during the time required for the
getting up of the text.—(241)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 513) in support of
the view that under abnormal circumstances learning may be acquired from
the Kṣatriya and the rest also; where it is explained that the
‘following’ here laid down is to be done only during the time that the
study is being carried on; and the implication of the mention of this
alone is that the other forms of ‘service’ are excluded; (such as
washing of the feet and the,like; this is in agreement with
Medhātithi);—and that ‘learning’ here includes *gems* and other things
also.

The verse is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 519);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 52), which explains that the ‘distress,’ ‘*āpat*’
meant here is the absence of a *Brāhmaṇa* teacher, and that in the case
of the non *-Brāhmaṇa* teacher, there is to be mere ‘following,’ no
feet-washing and the like;—in *Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 325), which adds
the same notes and explains ‘abrāhmaṇa’ as ‘ Kṣatriya or Vaiśya’;—and in
*Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 143), which says ‘following’ is the only
‘service’ to be rendered, and that also only during the course of study.

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 458) in support of
the view that the rules laid down regarding life-long studentship
pertain only to cases where the Teacher is a duly qualified
*Brāhmaṇa*;—in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 109) to the effect that life-long
studentship is permissible under a *fully efficient Brāhmaṇa
Teacher*;—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 549), where also it is
pointed out that the rules relating to life-long studentship laid down
below (under verses 247 *et. seq*.) pertain to cases where the teacher
is a fully qualified *Brāhmaṇa*.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 72) in support of the view that
in the event of having a Kṣatriya or some other caste for his ‘teacher,’
the Brāhmaṇa shall not take up life-long residence under him,—nor with a
Brāhmaṇa who is not fit to expound the Veda;—also in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 168).

The foregoing verse might create the impression that the Life-long
Student may live in residence with his non-Brāhmaṇa teacher, for the
purposes of study; and it is this that is particularly interdicted here.

‘*Ātyantikam vāsam*’—means *life-long residence*.

‘*Should not live*’—should not do. The phrase ‘*vāsam* *vaṣet*,’ ‘*live
in residence*,’ may be construed by regarding one (‘*vāsa*,’
‘residence’) as the particular and the other (‘*vaset*,’ ‘*live*’) as
the general (form of the same act of *living*). The meaning being ‘he
should not *live* that particular kind of *living* which is done in the
teacher’s house,’—‘he should go elsewhere after having finished his
studies.’

“All that the preceding verse has permitted is *learning* from a
non-Brāhmaṇa; how could there be any possibility of *life-long
residence*?”

There is no force in this objection. It has been said above that one
should *reside* with his preceptor; and the teacher has been called the
‘preceptor,’ hence the said possibility arises.

‘*Or, with the Brāhmaṇa who is not an expounder*.’—‘*Or*’ here stands
for ‘also.’

The Brāhmaṇa also, if he happen to be a *non-expounder*,—*i.e*., if he
is not equipped with good character and nobility, nor capable of
studying and teaching,—all these qualifications should be taken as
indicated by ‘expounding’; for if ‘expounding’ itself were meant, then
the *non-residence with a teacher who does no expounding* would be only
natural, \[and would not need to be strictly emphasised, as it is
here\].

‘*State*’ here stands for the attainment of bliss;—‘*Unsurpassable*’—to
which nothing else is superior;—‘*denting*’—such state,—*i.e*.,
Deliverance in the form of Highest Bliss—(242)

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 458), as laying

Brāhmaṇa-teacher;—to the same effect in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 504);—also
in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 551), where the term ‘*asmai*’ is
explained as standing for such a student as is not lame or dwarf, or
blind, or otherwise incapacitated; and it is added that the provision of
tins ‘life-long studentship’ need not be incompatible with the texts
laying down a *life-long* performance of the *Agnihotra* for the
Brāhmaṇa (which involves the necessity of taking a wife); because the
latter is meant for only those students who intend to enter the
‘Household,’ and are on that account called ‘*Upakurvāṇa*,’ as

This verse should be taken as prohibiting the making of presents to the
Teacher by the Life-long Student; since it lays down the gift to the
Teacher as to be presented only by the pupil who is going to take the
Final Bath, which the Life-long Student never takes; and it is the
Life-long Student that forms the subject of the context. As for the (the
other kind of student, who is only in temporary residence), he does go
on making presents to the Teacher, on every possible occasion, since the
very day of the Initiatory Rite.

‘*At first*’;—*i.e*., before the final Bath.

‘*Should not give anything to his Teacher*’;—the verb ‘*upakurvīta*’
stands here for *giving*, such being the force of the prefix; so that
the Dative in *gurave* is due to this verb itself. Or, the Teacher may
be regarded as the person aimed at by the *act* (denoted by
*upakurvīta*); and in this case the Dative would be in accordance with
the *Vārtika* on Pāṇini 2.3.13.

‘*But when going to take the Final Bath*’;—*i.e*., when the time for the
Final Bath has arrived;—‘*being ordered by the teacher*,’—in such words
as ‘bring me such and such a thing,’—he should ‘*to the best of his
capacity*’—as much as he may be able to bring,—‘*present somethin*,’
useful, ‘*to the teacher*.’

“But this verse contains (as you have asserted at the outset) the
prohibition of the Life-long Student presenting anything to the Teacher
\[and how do you reconcile this with the latter half, which prescribes
such *giving*?\].”

True; but the verse does not contain two independent sentences,—one (the
first half of the verse) prohibiting the gift, and the other (the second
half) permitting it. The fact is that there is a clear injunction that
at the Final Bath a gift should be made to the Teacher; and it is to
this injunction that the preceding prohibition is subservient; for, If
the present prohibition related to all kinds of beneñt to the Teacher,
the entire body of injunctions laying down the service of the Teacher
would become nullified; further, ‘*gift*’ is not the only *benefit* that
can be conferred; so that there is no justification for restricting the
prohibition of ‘benefit’ to the *gift of money* only, and not to the
‘doing of what is agreeable and beneficial to him.’ There is nothing
incongruous in taking the passage in a sense which is not the literal
meaning,—when the passage is a purely commendatory one; and it is quite
clear that the two halves of the verse form one syntactical whole
\[hence the former is taken as subservient and supplementary to the
latter\].—(245)

It has been said that he should present something to the Teacher; and
the present verse shows that any and everything should not be presented;
the sense being that if the Teacher orders—‘bring me the wife of such
and such a person,’ or ‘let me have all that you possess,’—then the
pupil shall not do what he says; what he should givo are as
fellows,—‘*Field*’—agricultural land;—‘*Gold*.’

‘*Or*’—signifies option; the sense being that all the things mentioned
shall not be given.

‘*Or at least*,’—*i.e*., in the absence of the other things.

‘*An umbrella and a pair of shoes*’;—these two being mentioned in a
copulative compound, it follows that both together have to be given.

‘*Clothes*;’—no significance is meant to be attached to the nouns in
this passage.

‘*Bringing joyfully*’;—this has to be construed with ‘*should present*,’
(of the preceding verse). If, however, we read this as ‘*prītimāharet*,’
‘should bring pleasure to his Teacher,’—then this sentence becomes
self-contained. ‘*Prītimāvahet*’ is another reading; the sense being
tbat ‘he should present the grain, etc., for bringing pleasure to the
Teacher’: or the *pleasure* may by itself be regarded as the object to
be brought to the Teacher: and in that case the mention of the things
becomes purely suggestive; the sense being that other things likely to
give him pleasure,—such as gems, pearls, corals, elephants, mules,
chariots, etc.,—may also be given. To this effect we have the saying of
Gautama (2.48)—‘On the completion of study the Teacher should be
presented with something useful.’

Only such things have to be presented as the pupil happens to possess,
he should not go about obtaining things by begging and other means, for
presenting.—(246)

This injunction is meant for the Life-long Student.

In the absence of the Preceptor, he should continue to live in
residence, either with the Preceptor’s son, who is endowed with Vedic
learning and other qualities, or with the Preceptor’s widow, or with the
Preceptor’s ‘*Sapiṇḍa*’; and towards each of these he should behave as
towards his Preceptor; *i.e*., he should present to him the food he
obtains as alms, and so forth.

The term ‘*dārā*,’ denoting, has been regarded by grammarians as always
used with the plural ending; but writers on Smṛti use the singular form
also; *e.g*., ‘*Dharmaprajā-* *sampanne dāre nānyām kurvīta*’
(Āpaṣṭamba, 2.11.13).—(247)

support of the view that in the absence of the Teacher’s wife, the
Student should take up ‘residence’ with the Teacher’s *Sapiṇḍa*, and in
the absence of this latter also, he should betake himself to the
‘tending of Fire’;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 549) to the effect
that ‘residence with Fire’ is to be taken up only in the absence of the
Teacher’s Sapiṇḍa;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 504), along with the
following verse;—in *Hāralatā* (p. 76) as referring to the ‘*Life-long*
Student’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 167), which says that

‘*Non-existence*’ may mean either *death*, or absence of proper
qualification.

‘*When all these are non-existent*,’ *he should carry on the tending of
the fire,—i.e*., he should continue to wash and besmear with clay the
fire-house, he should kindle the fire, he should constantly keep near
the Fire, just as his Preceptor used to do;—all this constitutes the
‘tending of the fire.’ While doing all this, ‘*he should perfect his
body*’—*i.e*., let it wear away; this is called ‘*perfecting*’ in the
same manner (of contrary signification) as the blind man is described as
‘having excellent eyes.’

‘*Sthānāsanavihāravān*’—‘*with only such diversion as standing and
sitting*’; *i.e*., he should amuse himself only by standing for sometime
and sitting for sometime.

Others have explained this to mean that he ‘should sit in the proper
posture for meditation’—such as the *Svasti(k/h?*) and the rest—‘and
should go about begging alms.’—(248)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Deham sādhayet*—‘Let the body wear away’ (Medhātithi and
Govindarāja);—‘shall make the Soul in his body perfect, *i.e*. fit for
union with Brahman’ (Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 458) as laying down
the duties of the lifelong Student;—in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 504);—in
*Madanapārijāta* (p. 106);—and in *Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra*, (p. 504),
where the note is added on the expression ‘*sthānāsanavihāravan*’ that
what is meant is that ‘during his spare time left after he has fully
accomplished all his duties, he may stand or sit or walk about’.
Medhātithi explains it to mean ‘at times he shall stand, and at times
sit down,—in this manner he shall divert himself.’ But he goes on to add
another explanation offered by ‘others’, by which the meaning is that
‘he shall practise the postures prescribed in connection with *Yogic*
practices, and live on alms’.—Nārāyaṇa explains the phrase to mean a
particular form of austerity consisting in ‘standing, sitting and
wandering’.—It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 167), which
explains the phrase to mean ‘standing, sitting and moving at stated
times.’

This phrase ‘*sthānāsanavihāra*’ appears to have been an old idiom; it
is met with for the first time in Baudhāyana’s Dharmasūtra (II. 1. 41),
where we read —

> *samudrasamyānam...... eṣāmanyatamat kṛtvā chaturtha kālāmitabhojinaḥ
> syuḥ ape? bhyapeyuḥ savanānukalpam sthānāsanābhyām viharanta ete
> tribhirvarṣaistadapahanti pāpam*.

Translated literally, this means—

> ‘Sea-voyage (and a few other acts enumerated)..., having done any one
> of these acts, people should eat sparsely at the fourth part of the
> day, should enter water in the morning, at midday and in the evening;
> *amusing themselves by sitting and standing*, *they destroy that sin
> after three years*.’

The exact meaning of the expiatory rite here prescribed has never been
understood. Whenever the question of sea-voyage has come up for
discussion, the antagonists of the voyage have held that by the last
clause Baudhāyana clearly meant that the voyager should have to commit
suicide; to spend three years ‘standing and standing’, *i.e*. without
any sleep—would he nothing short of self-immolation. The protagonists of
sea-voyage felt all along that the passage could not mean this; though
they were unable to suggest any other plausible explanation. They
thought that even if suicide were actually meant, there were more
effective means available for doing that; and in fact the ordinance that
‘the man shall not sleep for three years’ looked absurd on the face of
it.

We find the expression in several other works.

\(1\) In *Padmapurāṇa* (Ādi-khaṇḍa, 58. 26) we read in course of the
description of the duties of Vānaprastha, the man in the third stage of
life—*sthānāsanābhyām viharet na kvachid dhairyamutsṛjet*, ‘he shall
divert himself with sitting and standing, and shall not renounce his
steadiness on any point.’

The committing of suicide certainly could not form a duty of the
ordinary Yānaprastha, the hermit retiring from active life to a life of
meditation and worship.

\(2\) In *Yājñavalkya* (III 50) we read—*sthānāsanavihārairvā
yogābhyāsena vā tathā* (*dinam nayet*), where *Mitākṣarā* adds the
explanation—*kañcit kālam sthānam kañcit chopaveśanam*, ‘for some time
he shall sit, and for some time he shall stand’—in this manner he shall
spend the day. And Aparārka says—*sthānena gatinivṛttyā, āsanena,
upaveśanena vihāreṇa caṅkramaṇena* (*i*. *e*. ‘resting, sitting, and
walking) *ca divasam nayet*.

\(3\) Again in *Manu* (VI. 22) ‘*sthānāsanābhyām viharet*’ where
Medhātithi says, ‘*sthānāsanābhyām dine, rātrau tu
kevalasthaṇḍilaśāyītām vakṣyati*’, by which also the text means—‘he
shall spend the day in standing and sitting.’

\(4\) Lastly in *Manu* (XL 224) we meet with the same expression; and
here it forms part of the *Kṛcchra*—penance.

From all this it is clear that the phrase could never have been intended
to lay down anything so physically impossible as passing three years
‘without sleep.’ In fact a careful study of all the above texts leads us
to the conclusion that what is meant by the words ‘*sthānāsanābhyām
viharet*’ is exactly what is expressed by the Hindi idiom ‘*uṭha baiṭha
kara samaya bitānā*’; and the sense would appear to be that the man
shall have recourse to no other diversion or amusement, save what may be
obtained by ‘standing or sitting.’
