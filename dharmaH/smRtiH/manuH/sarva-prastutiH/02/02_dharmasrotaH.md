The entire Veda is the root-source of Dharma; also the Conscientious Recollection of righteous persons versed in the Veda, the Practice of Good (and learned) Men, and their self-satisfaction.—(6)


“What is the relevanoy of what is stated in this verse? It is Dharma that has been declared as the subject to be described; and Dharma can be described only by means of Injunctions and Prohibitions. Now as regards the fact of the Veda being the source of Dharma, this cannot form the subject of any injunction such as ‘the Veda should be known as the source of Dharma, as the authoritative means of ascertaining Dharma because this fact can be known without its being enjoined in so many words; certainly the fact of the Veda being the source of Dharma does not stand in need of being notified by any injunctions of such writers as Manu and others; in fact the authoritativeness of the Veda regarding matters relating, to Dharma is as self-evident as that of Direct Perception,—being based upon the facts that (1) it brings about cognitions that are never sublated, (2) that it is not the work of any person, and as such it is entirely free of any suspicion of falsity that might be due to the defects of such authors, and (3) that the words of the Veda itself are free from all defects.


“It might be argued that—‘what the text does is to refer to the well-established fact of the Veda being authoritative, with a view to indicate that the Smṛtis of Manu and others are based upon the Veda.’


“But this explanation cannot be accepted. For this fact also does not need to be stated; as (l) every Smṛti, by its very nature, must, be dependent upon a previous cognition, (2) the chances of mistake in the Smṛtis are precluded by the fact of their being accepted by great men, (3) the super-sensuous things spoken of in the Smṛtis could not be known to M anu and others (by any ordinary means of knowledge), and (4) every man knows it from his own experience that there is “recollection” of things taught in the Veda; so that the only possible view that could be entertained regarding the Smṛtis is that they are based upon the Veda [which, therefore, need not have been re-iterated in the Text]. Further, persons who know the Veda cannot stand in need of any Smṛti for learning what they should do; and lastly, when the Veda itself is the source of Dharma, there can be no need for postulating any other sources (in the shape of Smṛti, etc.).


“Nor is it right to assert that ‘the conscientious recollection of persons versed in the Veda is also merely referred to for the purpose of pointing out the unauthoritative character of the heterodox Smṛtis’; because the unauthoritative character of these latter is already well established by reasoning. For such heterodox people as the Śākya, the Bhojaka, the Kṣapaṇaka and the rest, there is no possibility of any knowledge of the Veda, by virtue of which they might be regarded as authoritative on matters treated of in their Smṛtis; because in the first place they do not admit any connection with the Veda; secondly, they openly declare that the Veda is hot authoritative; thirdly, they contain teachings directly opposed to the Veda; and lastly, these Smṛtis clearly prohibit the study of the Veda. If Buddha and others had been students of the Veda, then alone could there be any question as to whether or not their Smṛtis are based upon the Veda. When however, as a matter of fact, any connection with the Veda is not even remotely possible, how could there be any possibility of these being based upon the Veda? On the contrary, these writers themselves put forward an entirely different basis for their codes,—in the form of tradition (handed down through a series of several Buddhas); as for example, in the following words: ‘with my divine eyes I perceive the good and bad conditions of Bhikṣus.’ Exactly in the same manner, all such heterodox people as the Bhojaka, the Pañcarātra, the Nirgrantha, the Anarthavāda, the Pāśupata and the rest hold that their scriptures are the works of gifted personalities, particular deities, capable of directly perceiving the subjects dealt with by them; and they do not admit that Dharma has its source in the Veda; in fact their scriptures contain teachings directly opposed to the Veda; e.g., some of these people, holding that death frees the living being from the troubles of living, hold all Killing to be meritorious; and this (reckless) killing is distinctly prohibited in the Veda; similarly, others hold Bathing at sacred places to be sinful, while the Veda directly enjoins daily bathing and living at sacred places; so again, according to some people, the killing of animals at the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice is sinful; and this is against the Vedic injunction laying down the performing of that sacrifice;—lastly, some people hold that all such acts as the offering of libations and sacrifices are entirely selfish, while according to the Veda, which prescribes various deities in connection with the said acts, they are performed for the sake of these several deities. So that there is distinct disagreement between the Veda and the said heterodox scriptures.


“Some people have argued as follows:—


‘In the Veda also we find contradictory assertions e.g., one passage lays down the holding (of the Śodaśī-vessel, at the Atirātra sacrifice), while another says it should not be held; similarly one passage prescribes the time after Sunrise as best suited to the pouring of libations, while another lays down the time before Sunrise; so that it is quite possible that in the Veda itself—either in its lost Rescensions or even in such Rescensions as are not completely lost—there may be found injunctions contrary to a certain Vedic injunction [and these contrary Vedic passages would form the basis for the non-Vedic teachings of the heterodox Smṛtis ]. The number of Vedic Rescensions is endless; how could all of them be known to any one person? And it is quite possible that some of them might have become lost. So that it is quite possible that there may be some such Vedic Rescensional text as contains direct injunctions of such acts as Eating in a vessel made of human bones, remaining naked-skinned and so forth (which have been prescribed in some heterodox scriptures).’


“Our answer to the above is as follows:—We do not deny the possibility of mutually contradictory teachings being found in the Veda; what we mean is that in all such cases (where both the injunctions are equally directly perceived), both injunctions stand upon the same footing, and consequently the two acts are regarded as optional alternatives. In the case in question however (i.e., when the teaching of a heterodox scripture is found to contradict the direct teaching of the Veda), the Vedic text (in support of the heterodox teaching) could only be assumed; but there can be no occasion for the assumption of a text directly contradictory to one that is directly perceived. The mere possibility of a Vedic text (in support of the heterodox teaching) cannot lead to any certainty regarding its actual existence; while the Vedic injunction to the contrary is directly perceptible and certain; and certainly a certain text can never be sublated by an uncertain one. As for the theory of ‘lost Rescensions,’ we shall deal with it in detail later on, in our comments on this same verse. As regards the (orthodox) Smṛtis of Manu and others, their relationship to directly perceptible Vedic texts is quite patent; in some cases they are related to the Vedic mantras, in others to the Vedic deities, and in others again with substances and other details. No such relationship is possible in the case of the heterodox Smṛtis; hence no authority can ever belong to them (for the purpose of re-iterating which fact there could be a reference to the ‘Recollection of persons versed in the Veda.’)


“As regards Practice,—that which consists in what is actually done, with a view to invisible results, by persons learned iu the Veda,—its authoritative character is exactly like that of Recollection (Smṛti); because that also has its basis in the Veda. On the other hand, wrong Practice is generally based upon visible causes (of greed, &c.), and unlearned persons are apt to commit mistakes; hence it can not have any authority at all.


“Similarly with Self-satisfaction.


“If again the authority of the Veda, of Recollection and of Practice were dependent upon the teachings of Manu and others (in the shape of the present verse), on what would the authority of these latter rest? If on other teachings—such as ‘the Smārta Dharma has been expounded by Manu,’—then, whence the authority of these latter? In fact, the ultimate criterion as to what is authoritative and what is not authoritative, would be a purely logical one, and it would not consist in any teaching at all. So that the present verse is absolutely useless; and so also other similar verses that follow.”


“No one regards the Atharva as a Veda: (a) ‘The science is three-fold, consisting of the Ṛk, the Yajuṣ and the Sāman,’ (b) ‘The Sun moves forward, endowed with the three Vedas’ (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa, 3.12.91), (c) ‘One should keep up the observance of studying the three Vedas’; [all these speak of only three Vedas]. In fact we also find a prohibition regarding the Atharva—‘One should not recite the Atharvaṇas.’ It is in view of all these that people regard the followers of the Atharvaṇa as heretics, beyond the pale of the Vedic Triad.”


“It has been asserted that the Veda consists of injunctions, descriptions, mantras and names, and Dharma is of the nature of what should be done. Now it is only right that the Injunctive passages should be the means of knowing Dharm a; as it is from these that we learn that sacrifice and other acts should he done,—e.g., ‘the Agnihotra should be offered,’ ‘an offering of curds should be made,’ ‘offerings should he made in the morning and in the evening, to Agni and Prajāpati,’ ‘one desirous of attaining Heaven should pour libations into the fire.’ The whole set of these passages points to the particular action of ‘Agnihotra’ as one that should he done; ‘curds’ are the substance to be offered at the same sacrifice, Agni and Prajāpati are the deities to whom the offerings are to be made,—and the ‘desire for heaven’ is the qualifying condition for the performer.


“But in the Veda there are many such passages as—(a) ‘Agni is all the deities, Agni is the divine power of oblations, he invites the Gods and makes offerings to them,’ &c., and again (b) ‘Prajāpati cut out his own fat’ and so forth; and certainly such passages do not lay down anything to be done; all that they do is either to relate some past event or to describe some entirely irrelevant thing. If his own fat was cut out by Prajāpati, let him cut it; what is that to us? Similarly the fact of Agni being all deities does not help in the offerings to Agni; that Agni is the deity to whom the offering should be made having been declared by the word ‘Agni’ itself; if Agni is some other deity, then the mere fact of his being another deity would rule him out as a recipient of that offering. As for inviting, that also is laid down by another passage ‘we invite Agni, O Agni!’ Ac. And lastly, as for the mention of Agni inviting and making offerings to the Gods, this is absolutely meaningless.


“As regards mantras again, there are some,—e.g., (a) ‘There was neither death nor immortality, &.,’ (Ṛgveda, 10.129.2), (b) ‘Sudeva might fall to-day never to return, &c.,’ (Ṛgveda, 10.95.14) and so forth—which either describe some past event or contain a wailing; and what Dharma could such mantras expound? At that time there was neither death, nor immortality, nor life—certainly no living being having been born before creation, there, was no life or death of any one; during the universal dissolution also, there may come about the death of all things, or it may not come about,—it does not teach us anything as to anything to be done. Similarly, Sudeva, a certain highly meritorious godlike man, might to-day fall, i.e.,—might throw himself into a pit—never to return—i.e., after which fall he cannot come back to life;—this is how Purūravas, separated from Urvaśī, bewailed.


Similarly as regards Names,—e.g, as ‘one should sacrifice with the Udbhid,’ ‘one should sacrifice with the Balabhid,’ &c., &c.,—they do not enjoin any act or substance; the enjoining of the action being done by the verb (‘should sacrifice’), and the word ‘Balabhid’ and ‘Udbhid, &c., not being expressive of any substance; specially as the substance for the sacrifice iu question in the form of Soma—is got at from its archetype by virtue of the direct injunction. [that ‘the ectypal sacrifices are to be performed in the manner of their archetypes,’ and the archetype of the Udbhid sacrifice is the Jyotiṣṭoma at which soma-juice is the substance offered]; and hence there is no necessity for twisting the words ‘udbhid,’ &c., to yield the name of some sacrificial material [such as tree or spade, which may be indicated by the etymology of the word ‘udbhid,’ which means ‘that which shoots out’ or ‘that with which digging is done’]. Thus it is clear that no dharma is indicated by the names. How then can it be said that ‘the entire Veda is the root of dharma?’”


“The Śyena and other sacrifices of the kind are in the form of malevolent spells; and partaking of the character of murder, they are distinctly of the nature of ‘Himsā’ (Injury); and since all form of injury is cruel, and all evil spells have been prohibited, these sacrifices must be ‘Adharma,’ the opposite of ‘Dharma’ (sinful). [And since the Veda lays down such sacrifices] the ‘entir’ Veda cannot be the ‘root of Dharma.’ Por ‘Dharma’ has been explained as ‘what should be done,’ and certainly the killing of the Brāhmaṇa is not ‘what should be done.’ How then can the passages laying down such acts be the ‘root of Dharma’? Further, even the animal-sacrifices—Agniṣomīya and the rest,—involve the killing of animals, and as such are very far removed from the character of ‘Dharma.’ That killing is sinful is admitted by all enquiries. To this end it has been said ‘where the killing of living beings is Dharma, what can be Adharma?’”


“It has been held that Recollection is not a reliable means of knowledge; and the reason for this that is given is that Recollection only serves to recall what has been apprehended by other means of knowledge, and does not lead to the apprehension of anything new.”


“It is quite possible that Manu and others have compiled their ‘Recollections’ from imagination, without having actually apprehended what they speak of; in the same manner as certain poets compose a story after having created the whole plot from imagination.”


“But people might he led to perform it by mistake.”


“Who has laid down the law that in the said passage the Injunction is conveyed, not directly by the Arthavāda itself, but by the fact of its being connected with another Injunctive passage? As a matter of fact, the passage itself contains an independent finite verb of its own—‘these four fall’ [and this would serve as the direct prohibition). It might be argued that the verb does not contain the Injunctive affix: But the passage ‘they obtain a standing who per form the Rātrisatra’ also contains no verb ending with the Injunctive affix. It might he argued that—‘in the case of the Rātrisatra, the need for a qualifying condition being distinctly felt, the two sentences (they obtain a standing and they perform the Rātrisatra) come to be taken as syntactically connected, and the necessary injunction is got at by assuming the verb to contain the Let ending.’—But the same may be said in regard to the passage in question also. In fact, there are several injunctions of substances and deities that are obtained from Arthavādas. In a case where the Arthavāda is distinctly subservient to an Injunctive passage,—since this latter injunction would be in need of the mention of a substance or a deity (for the act enjoined) [that may be found mentioned in the corresponding Arthavāda], it may not be improper to take the Arthavāda as simply serving to supply the needs of the corresponding Injunction (and not as enjoining anything independently by itself). In the present instance however (of the Arthavāda passage ‘the theft of gold, etc., etc.’), if we are to seek for an injunction that has no connection with the Arthavāda (and this injunction were sought to be derived from the words of the Arthavāda itself), then this would give rise to a syntactical split; hence it cannot be taken as subservient to the main subject-matter of the context (i.e., the science of the Five Fires); and in the absence of such subserviency, the Arthavāda could not provide any idea of the Prohibition. This is the point on which the case of the Arthavāda in question is not analogous to that of the sentences—‘One should put in wet pebbles’ and ‘Butter is glory’ [where the connection between the two is quite clear].”


‘The view that some Vedic texts have become lost is not accepted by me; as this view necessitates several unwarrantable assumptions. It is far more reasonable to accept the view that the Smṛtis have brought together the injunctions of actions scattered about here and there. In fact even at the present day we find that a person who is surrounded by several Vedic scholars and teachers is capable of composing works after having heard from those persons the several Vedic texts. It is only natural that persons who have actually seen the writer at the time, basing his statements upon direct Vedic texts should accept them as trustworthy; and we also come to have due confidence in them as far as possible. As a matter of fact, the details of performance are indicated by Mantras; and there is indication of them also by Names; there can be no performance, unless there is some sort of indication regarding the nature of the action and the qualifying conditions. For instance, the connection of a particular deity with the Āghāra -offering is indicated by the words of a Mantra; and the reason for this lies in the indicative character of Mantras, which character becomes possible only if the Deity is taken to be indicated by them. When one action enters into the constitution of another well-accomplished one, it does not interfere with the form of this latter [so that when a Deity indicated by the Mantra is introduced into an action enjoined by a distinct Injunctive passage, it does not interfere with the nature of this action]. For instance, in connection with the Viśvajit sacrifice, we find that the desirable result proceeding from it is got at from sources other than its originative Injunction. Thus it is quite reasonable to assume details in connection even with a well-established injunction, specially when the needs of the Injunction are not supplied even by Mantras and Arthavādas.


‘[An objection is raised]—


“The revered Pāṇini has laid down that Injunction is expressed only by the Injunctive and other cognate affixes. So that Mantras and Arthavādas, describing as they do only accomplished entities, can never express an injunction. If then, from theArthavāda, which is not directly injunctive, some sort of Injunction were deduced by means of an indirect interpretation put upon the Arthavāda,—how could any reliance be placed upon such an Injunction? In fact such an interpretation would lead to a syntactical split; specially as (in such arthavādas as they obtain a standing who perform the Rātrisatra) the Rātris tra offerings do not necessarily stand in need of the ‘standing.’ In fact it is only a detail of the direct Injunction (and not that of the vāda) which can be accepted as indicated by supplementary sentences. As regards the prohibition of Theft, etc. (which has been sought to be deduced from the Arthavāda passage ‘the theft of gold, etc., etc.’), this will certainly be amenable to a direct Injunction; and as in the event of the arthavāda being made to yield the necessary injunction, syntactical split would be inevitable. Nor is there any analogy between the Vācastoma and the Aṣṭakā; for in the sacrifice all the details are performed in accordance with injunctions deduced from mantras; while in the case of the Aṣṭakā there are no grounds for regarding the mantra as indicative of any details of performance. Further, no indicative power of the mantra can prompt one to any course of action, unless there is some sort of a general connection; and in the case in question there is no such connection either of context or of any such factor.”


‘To the above objection the following reply is given by those who hold the view that also are the source of Dharma:—(a) In the case of the passage “they obtain a standing, etc.,” even though there is no directly injunctive agency in the form of the Injunctive affix and the rest, yet the idea of injunction is held to be supplied by the conjugational affix let (in the verb “upayanti,” “offer”). (b) Similarly in the case of the verb “patanti” “they fall” (occurring in the passage “Theft of gold, etc.”), or in that of the verb “use corrupt words” (occurring in another arthavāda passage), (c) In connection with the Vācastoma, we have the distinct injunction beginning with the expression ‘sarvadāśa ṭayīḥ anubrūyāt,’—this name “dāśatayī” being applied to the ten Ṛk. verses selected each out of the ten maṇḍalas of the Ṛgveda. (d) As regards the general connection (of the mantra) with the action, this is said to be brought about by the force of the Name,—the Gṛhyamantras being named after the acts (with which they are connected). (e) As regards the arthavāda passage “Theft of gold, etc., etc.,” that this is subservient to the Science of the Five Fires is indicated by the fact that it contains a deprecation of the said Theft, etc.; and this cannot be possible except when the Prohibition (of the Theft, etc.) is also implied. That the passage is subservient to the Science of Five Fires is indicated by the trend of the whole context; and the idea that the Theft, etc., should not be done serves to emphasise the said subserviency; and there is no incompatibility between these two [the idea of subserviency and that the acts should not be done ]. Lastly, as regards the view that the Vedic texts in corroboration of the Smṛti rules h ave always been inferred (and never actually found by any one in the Veda),—it stands on the same footing as the notion of long-standing tradition; both would be of the nature of the “blind following the blind”; and we do not perceive any difference between these two views.’


“As a matter of fact, everything that is enjoined in the Veda and in the Smṛtis is the source of Dharma; and since ‘Śīla’ also is included among the acts thus enjoined, there is no point in mentioning it separately. In fact Manu himself is going to enjoin it in the following verse—‘Day and night one should take care to subdue the senses’ (7.41),—and again—‘When the mind has been subdued, the two groups of five become subdued.’ And it is this ‘subjugation of the mind’ which constitutes the ‘abandoning of love and hate,’ as we shall explain later on.”


“If this is what is meant, it should be stated dearly, in the form ‘the words of Manu and others, are the sources of Dharma’; what is the use of setting forth the characteristics (of the writers)?”


“But it may happen that a man’s mind is satisfied with a prohibited (sinful) act; and this would have to be regarded as Dharma. Again, a man may have hesitation (and doubt) regarding what is enjoined in the Veda; and this latter would h ave to be regarded as n ot‘ Dharma.’”

     M G J DK (5: 90) read _bhikṣūṇām_ in the genitive, and Jha translates: "good and bad conditions of Bhikṣus." A variant in five manuscripts recorded by Gharpure reads: _bhikṣāva_. I think this is probably a wrong transcription of _bhikṣave_, written in the old Nāgari pṛṣṭhamātrā. Now, this is not standard Sanskrit, but the form is found in Pāli and even more significantly in Gāndhāri Buddhist manuscripts from north-western India. Perhaps, Medhātithi living in Kashmir, had access to these kinds of Buddhist texts. We do find texts similar to the one cited by Medhātithi in several Buddhist texts: _paśyāmy ahaṃ bhikṣavaḥ divyena cakṣuṣā viśuddhenātikrāntamānuṣyakena satvāṃ cyavantāṃ upapadyantāṃ suvarṇāṃ durvavarṇāṃ sugatāṃ durgatāṃ . . ._ (_Mahāvastu, _ed.

Our answer to the above objection is as follows:—

The authors of treatises on Dharma proceed to compose their works for
the expounding of their subject for the benefit of such persons as are
not learned (in the Vedas). Hence it is that having themselves learnt
from the Veda that the *Aṣṭakā* and such other acts should be performed,
they incorporate in their own work the injunctions of these acts, for
the purpose of conveying the same knowledge to others similarly in the
case of such matters as the authoritative character of the Veda \[which
are known by the *Smṛti-* writers themselves from the Veda, and yet they
proceed to include that information in their work for the edification of
persons not equally learned\]. As a matter of fact, there are many
enquirers who are incapable of ascertaining truth by means of
independent reasoning,—not being endowed with an intellect capable of
ratiocination; and for the benefit of these persons even a logically
established fact is stated by the writers in a friendly spirit. Hence
what is herein stated regarding Veda being the source of Dharma is a
well-established fact. What the statement ‘Veda is the source of Dharma’
means is that ‘the fact of Veda being the source of Dharma has been
ascertained after due consideration, and one should never doubt its
authoritative character.’ Even in ordinary experience we find people
teaching others facts ascertained by other means of knowledge; *e.g*.
\[when the physician teaches\]—‘you should not eat before the food
already taken has been digested, for indigestion is the source of
disease.’ It cannot be rightly urged that “those who are unable to
comprehend, by reasoning, the fact of Veda being the source of Dharma,
can not comprehend it through teaching either”; for as a matter of fact
we find that when certain persons are known to be ‘trustworthy,’ people
accept their word as true, without any further consideration. The whole
of the present section therefore is based on purely logical facts, and
not on the Veda, in other cases also,—*e.g*., in the case of *Smṛtis*
dealing with law-suits, &c.—what is propounded is based upon logic, as
we shall show later on, as occasion arises. How the performance of the
*Aṣṭakā*, etc., is based upon the Veda we shall show in the present
context itself.

The word ‘*Veda*’ here stands for the Ṛg, Yajuṣ and Sāman, along with
their respective Brāhmaṇas; all these are fully distinguished, by
students, from all other sentences (and compositions). Learners who have
their intellect duly cultured through series of teachings, understand,
as soon as a Vedic passage is uttered, that it is Veda,—their
recognising of the Veda being as easy as the recognition of a man as a
Brāhmaṇa. This word ‘Veda’ is applied to the whole collection of
sentences,—beginning with ‘*Agnimīle purohitam*,’ ‘*Agnirvai
devānāmvarua*,’ and ending with ‘*atha mahāvāratam*’ (Ṛgveda); as also
to the several individual sentences forming part of the said collection;
and this application of the word is not direct in the one case and
indirect in the other,—as is the case with the word ‘village’ as applied
(directly) to the entire group of habitations, and (indirectly) to each
individual habitation. In the case of the word ‘village’ the twofold
usage is based upon the principle that words denoting the composites are
also applicable to the components; the word ‘village’ is known to be
used generally in the sense of ‘a group of houses,’ and yet in the case
of such expressions as ‘the village is burnt,’ it ìb used in the sense
of a few individual houses in the village; as it is when people say ‘the
village has been burnt,’ when in reality only a few houses have be in
burnt. Or, in this ease also the word ‘village’ may be regarded as used
in the sense of the *group* only; and what happens is that it is the
*burning*, which, though really pertaining to only a portion of that
group, is spoken of as pertaining to the entire group as related to the
said portion; specially as it is only through its components that a
composite can have any connection with an act; in fact the composite’s
connection with acts can be none other than that of the components;
apart from the components, the composite cannot be either seen or
touched.

We now proceed to explain the etymology of the word ‘*Veda*.’ The ‘Veda’
is that from which people derive their knowledge of Dharma, which cannot
be known from any other source of knowledge—\[ *vidanti asmāṭ iti vedaḥ*
\]; and this *knowledge* of Dharma is derived from each individual
sentence; hence the name is not restricted to the entire collection of
*Adhyāyas* and *Anuvākas* that go under the name ‘*Ṛgveda*.’ It is on
this understanding that the penalty of having the tongue cut off is
inflicted (upon the Śūdra) when he pronounces a single sentence out of
the Veda. On the same principle also is the epithet ‘whole’ found in the
injunction that ‘the *whole* Veda should be studied,’ where it serves to
indicate the necessity of studying all the sentences contained in the
Veda; otherwise (if the epithet ‘whole’ were not there) the learner
would be satisfied with the reading of only a few sentences, and would
not read the whole Veda. All this we shall explain in detail in the
present work.

This *Veda* is variously divided. The *Sāma Veda* is said to have a
thousand ‘paths’ (*i.e*., Rescensions), in the shape of ‘*Sātya*,’
‘*Mugri*,’ ‘*Rāṇāyanīya*’ and so forth; there are a hundred Rescensions
of the *Yajurveda*, in the shape of ‘*Kāṭhaka*,’ ‘*Vājasaneyaka*’ and
the rest; there are twenty-one Rescensions of the *Ṛgveda*; and nine of
the *Atharva Veda* in the shape of ‘*Modaka*’ ‘*Paippalādaka*,’ and so
forth.

\[*Objection*\]—

> “No one regards the Atharva as a *Veda*: (*a*) ‘The science is
> three-fold, consisting of the Ṛk, the Yajuṣ and the Sāman,’ (*b*) ‘The
> Sun moves forward, endowed with the *three* Vedas’ (Taittirīya
> Brāhmaṇa, 3.12.91), (*c*) ‘One should keep up the observance of
> studying the *three* Vedas’; \[all these speak of only *three*
> Vedas\]. In fact we also find a prohibition regarding the Atharva—‘One
> should not recite the Atharvaṇas.’ It is in view of all these that
> people regard the followers of the Atharvaṇa as *heretics*, beyond the
> pale of the *Vedic Triad*.”

\[*Answer*\]—This is not right; all good men agree in regarding the
Atharvaṇa as a *Veda*. In this *Smṛti* itself (11.33) we find the
expression ‘*śrutīratharvāṅgirasīḥ*,’ where the Atharva is spoken of as
‘*śruti*,’ and ‘*śruti*’ is the same as ‘Veda.’

Further \[whether a certain Veda is called ‘Veda’ or not is of no
import\]; when certain passages—those prescribing the *Agnihotra* and
other sacrifices, which all people call ‘Veda’—are regarded as
authoritative in matters regarding Dharma, they are so accepted, not
because they are called by the name of ‘Veda’;—because the name ‘Veda’
is sometimes applied to *Itihāsa* and the *Āyurveda* also, when, for
instance, it is said that ‘*Itihāsa* and *Purāṇa* are the fifth Veda’
(*Chandogya Upaniṣad*, 7.1.2), \[and yet these are not regarded as
authorities on Dharma\];—but because they are independent of human
agency, and help to make known our duties, and because they are free
from mistakes; and all these conditions are fulfilled by the Atharva:
such acts as the Jyotiṣṭoma and the like are prescribed in the Atharva
just as they are in the Yajuṣ and the other Vedas. Some people have
fallen into the mistake that the Atharva cannot be *Veda* because it
abounds in teachings of acts dealing with malevolent magic (witchcraft).
As a matter of fact, malevolent magic, as leading to the death of living
beings, is always prohibited.

\[It is described, because\] it is employed by the priests of kings who
are well versed in magical spells; but it is deprecated.

It has been argued above that “the Atharva is not mentioned among Vedas,
in such passages as ‘the Sun moves, endowed with the *three*
Vedas.’”—But the passages quoted are merely declamatory (Arthavāda); it
is therefore of no consequence whether or not the Atharva is mentioned
among them. Or, the passages that speak of ‘three Vedas,’ ‘the triple
science,’ and so forth may be taken as referring to the three *kinds* of
mantras; besides the three kinds of *mantras* found in the Ṛk, Yajuṣ and
Sāma Vedas, there is no fourth kind,—the Exhortations, the Invocations,
the lowly recited Prayers and the Hymns to Indra, and such other Mantras
being all included under these three. In the Atharva Veda also, the
mantras mentioned are all of the ‘Ṛk’ class; hence so far as the
classification according to the *kind* of mantra is concerned, it comes
under the ‘Ṛgveda.’

As regards the interdict placed upon the study of the Atharva Veda, it
indicates a conclusion quite the reverse of that which it has been cited
(by the opponent) to prove: A prohibition is possible only of what is
otherwise possible \[so that the very prohibition proves that the said
study was, and should be, prevalent, except under the circumstances
referred to in the interdict\]. Or, the passage quoted may simply mean
that ‘one should not mix up the performance of acts enjoined in the
other three Vedas with that of those prescribed in the Atharva Veda; for
instance, during the performance of the *Vācastoma* sacrifices, the
reciting of all Ṛk, Sāman and Yajuṣ mantras is enjoined, and the said
prohibition precludes the reciting, at this sacrifice, of the mantras
occurring in the Atharva Veda.

The above-described *Veda*—which is a particular kind of literary
compilation, not by any human author, which is divided into several
‘Rescensions,’ and known under the name ‘*Mantra-Brāhmaṇa*’—is the
‘*root*’—*i.e*., the *authority*, the *means of knowing*—‘*of Dharma*.’
‘*Root*,’ here means *cause*. The *Veda* and *Smṛti* can be a ‘cause’
only in the sense that they serve to *make known*,—not in that of
*producing*, nor in that *helping to stand*, which are the two senses in
which the ‘*root*’ is the *cause* of the Tree.

The term ‘*dharma*’ we have already explained above; it is that which a
man should do, and which is conducive to his welfare, and of a character
different from such acts as are amenable to perception and the other
ordinary means of knowledge. Land-cultivation, service, &c., also are
conducive to man’s welfare; but this fact of their being so beneficial
is ascertained by means of positive and negative induction; and as
regards the sort of cultivation that brings a good harvest of grains,
this is ascertained by direct perception and other ordinary means of
knowledge. On the other hand, the fact of sacrifices being conducive to
welfare, and the manner in which they are beneficial, through the
intervention of the ‘Apūrva,’—all this is not amenable to perception or
other ordinary means of knowledge. ‘Welfare’is that which is, in its
most general form, spoken of as ‘pleasure,’ consisting of the attaining
what is desirable, in the shape of Heaven, landed property and so forth,
and also (*b*) the avoiding of what is generally spoken of as ‘pain,’
which consists of illness, poverty, unhappiness, Hell and so forth.
Others regard the attaining of Supreme Bliss only as ‘welfare.’

This *Dharma* is learnt from such passages in the Brāhmaṇas as contain
the ‘*liṅ*’ and other injunctive expressions. In some cases we learnt it
also from *mantras; e.g*., from such mantras as ‘*Vasantāya kapiñjalān
ālabhale*,’ ‘offers the Kapiñjala birds to Vasanta’ (*Vājasaneyi
Samhitā*, 24. 20). Among these such passages as contain the word
‘*Kāma*’ (‘desire’) indicate that the act therein enjoined is to be
performed for the purpose of obtaining a definite result; *e.g*.,
‘*brahmavarcasakāmaḥ*,’ (‘one desirous of acquiring Brahmic glory should
offer cooked rice to Sūrya’), ‘*Vaiśvadevīm* *sāṅgrahiṇīṃ nirvapet
grāmakāmaḥ*’ (‘one desirous of acquiring landed property should offer
the Śāṅgrahini to the Viśvedevas’); and the actions thus enjoined are
not done by one who is not desirous of obtaining the particular results
spoken of. There are other acts which are pointed out as compulsory, by
means of such words as ‘*yāvajjīvam*’ (‘throughout one’s life’) and so
forth. These are not performed with a view to any results,—there being
no results mentioned as following from them. Nor will it he right to
assume, in this case also, a definite result in the shape of Heaven, in
accordance with the ‘Viśvajit’—principle (laid down in the Pūrva-Mimānsā
Sūtra 4.3.15-16); because the presence of such words as ‘throughout
life’ and so forth already indicates that these are to be performed
without any reference to results, and the omission of these acts simply
involves the sin of disobeying the scriptural injunction. So that it is
with a view to avoid this sin that the acts thus prescribed are
performed. This same holds good regarding prohibitions—such as ‘the
Brāhmaṇa should not he killed,’ ‘wine should not be drunk’; the avoiding
of the prohibited act is not for the purpose of any reward, but simply
for the purpose of avoiding something sinful;

‘*Entire*,’—whole. That is, there is not a single word, consonant or
vowel (of the Veda) that is not conducive to *Dharma*.

Some people raise the following objection against this:—

> “It has been asserted that the Veda consists of injunctions,

Our answer to the above is as follows:—It is just in view of these
doubts that the Author has added the epithet ‘*entire*’; by which it is
meant that all these passages that have been cited by the objector help
in providing knowledge of Dharma.

\(A\) First, as regards *Arthavādas*, these are not meant to be
construed apart from the injunctive passages; it is only if they were so
construed that they would fail to help in the knowledge of *dharma*. As
a matter of fact, we find that if the Arthavāda is taken apart by
itself, it remains syntactically defective; and this leads us to
conclude that they subserve the purposes of the corresponding injunctive
passages; being so subservient to these latter, they come to be
construed along with them; and hence they have got to be explained in
such a manner as to make them fit in with the corresponding injunction.
Thus the mention of Prajāpati having cut his fat cannot be taken by
itself; it has to be taken as supplementing an injunction; in view of
the fact however that the Arthavādas do not denote a substance, a
sacrificial accessory, or any such thing as generally forms the direct
object of injunction, they are construed differently, as eulogising what
is directly enjoined, and thus come to be recognised as supplementing
the injunction. This praise of the enjoined thing is also expressed by
the Arthavāda; for instance, the sense of the passage in question is
this—‘it is so necessary to perform animal-sacrifices that, at a time
when no animals were available, and there was no other remedy, Prajāpati
constituted himself into the animal and cut out his own fat.’ That such
is the construction to be put upon the Arthavāda is shown by the fact
that whenever we have *Arthavādas*, they always accompany injunctive
passages. Thus even though the sense of the injunction is comprehended
even without the accompanying *Arthavāda*,—*e.g*., in the case of the
injunction ‘one should offer the Kapiñjala birds to Vasanta,’ we
comprehend the injunction from the sentence itself,—yet the Arthavādas
are not absolutely useless; for when the Arthavāda is there, it is not
right to deduce the injunction from the injunctive sentence only. The
Veda is not the work of any author; we cannot argue (from the analogy of
human speeches) that ‘since in one case the injunction has no Arthavāda
to help it, it need not have it in another case also’;—the *Arthavādas
are* there, we *have* to construe them; and what we have shown above is
the only right way in which the particular Arthavāda can be construed.
Nor is there anything very extraordinary in this; in ordinary practice
also, we find eulogistic words accompanying injunctions; for instance,
at the time that the master is paying -wages to his servants, some
servant says affectionately (in regard to another)—‘This Devadatta is a
good servant, he is always present, knows the occasions of service and
is always careful about it.’ Thus we find that *Arthavādas* also serve
the purpose of *enjoining*, through the eulogising of what is enjoined
by the injunction. In fact, in certain cases, details of what is
enforced by the injunction are got at from the *Arthavāda* only; for
instance, when the injunction says, ‘wet pebbles are to be put in,’ this
injunction stands in need of some *wetting substance*, such as butter
oil, etc.; so that when it is followed by the Arthavāda ‘Butter is
glory,’ this praise of Butter leads us to conclude that Butter is the
welting substance to be used. Similarly the Arthavāda ‘those who have
recourse to these *Rātris* become respected’serves to point out the
qualifying conditions for the performers of the *Rātri-satra* sacrifice.
From all this it is clear that *Arthavādas* also are ‘*the root of
Dharma*.’

\(B\) Next as regards *Mantras*, some of them are directly injunctive;
*e.g*., the *Mantra* ‘*Vasantāya kapiñjalān ālabhate*’ (‘offers the
Kapiñjala birds to Vasanta’);—in connection with the *Āghāra-offering*,
the deity to whom the offering is to be made is pointed out by the
mantra ‘*Ita Indra urdhvo*’ *dhvaraḥ*, etc.’ In this case the Deity is
not mentioned in the passage that enjoins the offering, nor is it
mentioned in any other purely injunctive passage; the particular
*mantra* to be used however is directly enjoined as being the one that
begins with ‘*Ita Indra*’; hence it is from the words of this *mantra*
that we learn the name of the requisite Deity. There are thousand, of
such instances where the Deity is indicated by the words of the
*mantra*. Then, there are certain *mantras* that are only descriptive of
what is being done; and these also serve the purpose of making known
*Dharma* by reminding (the persons engaged in the act, of what is to be
done); and thus these also become ‘*root of Dharma*’ by indicating what
*should be done*.

\(C\) Thirdly, as regards the *Names*, they are never found apart from
verbs, and hence, like verbs, they have their character of being the
‘*root of Dharma*’ well established, Then again, as a matter of fact,
the accessory details of sacrifices are generally enjoined through these
*names* (of sacrifices); *e.g*., (*a*) ‘In the *Śarat* season one should
perform the sacrifice,’ (*b*) ‘one desirous of Kingdom of Heaven should
perform the *Vajapeya*’ \[in the former we have the injunction of the
*time* of performance, and in the latter, of the *Result*, and both are
mentioned along with the name of the sacrifice ‘*Vājapeya*’\].

Thus it is proved that the ‘*entire* Veda’ is the ‘root of Dharma.’

Other people have taken the word ‘*entire*’ as added with a view to the
possible objection that no knowledge of Dharma is provided by the Vedic
passages laying down the *Shu??a* (Śyena?) and such other objectionable
acts, or by the Prohibitions—such as ‘one should not eat garlic.’

The objection anticipated by these people is as follows:—

> “The *Śyena* and other sacrifices of the kind are in the form of
> malevolent spells; and partaking of the character of *murder*, they
> are distinctly of the nature of ‘*Himsā*’ (Injury); and since all form
> of injury is cruel, and all evil spells have been prohibited, these
> sacrifices must be ‘*Adharma*,’ the opposite of ‘*Dharma*’ (sinful).
> \[And since the Veda lays down such sacrifices\] the ‘*entir*’ Veda
> cannot be the ‘root of *Dharma*.’ Por ‘*Dharma*’ has been explained as
> ‘what should be done,’ and certainly the killing of the Brāhmaṇa is
> not ‘what should be done.’ How then can the passages laying down such
> acts be the ‘root of Dharma’? Further, even the
> animal-sacrifices—*Agniṣomīya* and the rest,—involve the killing of
> animals, and as such are very far removed from the character of
> ‘Dharma.’ That killing is sinful is admitted by all enquiries. To this
> end it has been said ‘where the killing of living beings is *Dharma*,
> what can be *Adharma*?’”

Now how is this objection anticipated? It is anticipated (say these
other people) by the adding of the epithet ‘*entire*.’ There is no other
use for this epithet.

It might be asked why no reason has been given \[by Manu, why and how
the entire Veda is the root of Dharma\]; but our answer is that this is
a work in the form of Precept, and as such states well-established
conclusions; and those persons who seek after the ‘why’ and ‘wherefore’
of these conclusions are instructed by *Pūrvamīmāmsā*.’We have already
said that this work is addressed to persons who are prepared to learn
tilings from Precept alone.

The author of the *Vivaraṇa* however puts forward a few arguments
also:—It has been argued by the opponent that the *Śyena* and other such
sacrifices, being prohibited, must be ‘*adharma*’ sinful. This is quite
true. But even though these acts are prohibited, yet in certain cases it
so happens that some people may have their animosity too strong to allow
of their submitting to the general prohibition of *killing*,—in such
other passages has ‘no living beings should be killed,’—and such persons
derive from the *Śyena*, the pleasure of killing their enemy; and to
that small extent, as conducive to this pleasure, the *Śyena* may be
regarded as ‘*dharma*’; so that the passage prescribing the *Śyena* does
not cease to be the ‘source of Dharma.’ Secondly, as for prohibitions,
it is only a person who is moved by passion to do the killing that is
guided by the prohibition; and the acting up to the prohibition only
consists in not doing what is prohibited \[and this desisting from the
prohibited act is meritorious, *Dharma* \] Thirdly, the prohibition of
killing does not apply to the killing that is done in course of the and
other such offerings; and what is prohibited by the general prohibition
of killing is only that killing in ordinary practice which is done
through malice. That killing, on the other hand, which is distinctly
enjoined and has scriptural sanction, can never form the subject of
prohibition; specially as the prohibition has its use in connection with
ordinary killing. Nor is it possible to deduce the sinfulness of the
scriptural killing, on the analogy of ordinary killing, from the general
proposition that ‘all killing is sinful.’ Because what makes the killing
sinful is not merely its character of ‘killing,’ but also the fact of
its being prohibited; and we have already pointed out that the
prohibition does not apply to the scriptural killing.

-----------------------------------------------

Some people explain the word ‘*mūla*,’ ‘root’ to mean *cause*;—the
meaning being that ‘of Dharma Veda is the root,—the basis, the
cause—either directly or indirectly.’ It is the ‘direct cause of Dharma’
in such passages as ‘one should study the Veda,’ ‘one should get up the
Ṛgveda, etc.’; and it is the ‘indirect cause’ when it points out the
detailed form of the *Agnihotra* and such other acts.

-----------------------------------------------

‘*Smṛtiśīle ca tadvidān*’—‘*Conscientious Recollection of persons versed
in the Veda*’;—‘*Smṛti*,’ ‘*Recollection*’ is the idea that one has of
what has been apprehended before.—The pronoun. ‘*tat*’ (in the compound
‘*tadvidām*’) stands for the *Veda*; and those who know the Veda are
called ‘*Vedavidaḥ*,’ ‘*versed in the Veda*.’ The meaning thus is that
another ‘authority’ (means of knowing) for *Dharma*. consists in the
idea, ‘this should be done, that should not be done,’ entertained by
people learned in the Veda.

> “It has been held that Recollection is not a reliable means of
> knowledge; and the reason for this that is given is that Recollection
> only serves to recall what has been apprehended by other means of
> knowledge, and does not lead to the apprehension of anything new.”

This is true; for the persons to whom the recollection belongs, it is
the original means of knowledge—Trustworthy Assertion or Perception,
etc.—that constitutes the reliable source of knowledge; and one’s own
Recollection is not a reliable source of knowledge for himself. But for
us (ordinary mortals), it is the Recollection of Manu and such other
persons that forms a reliable source of knowledge; we have no other
means, except the said Recollection, for knowing that the *Aṣṭakā* and
such other acts should be done. That the Recollection of Manu, etc., was
actually in a certain form, we learn from the assertions made by
themselves that have come down to us through a long line of tradition.
And from this Recollection we come to the conclusion that the
subject-matter of them was actually apprehended by Manu, etc., by the
ordinary means of knowledge; and this is indicated by the fact of the
Recollection being there, and no.Recollection being possible without
previous apprehension.

> “It is quite possible that Manu and others have compiled their
> ‘Recollections’ from imagination, without having actually apprehended
> what they speak of; in the same manner as certain poets compose a
> story after having created the whole plot from imagination.”

The answer to this is as follows:—This might be so, if the works under
consideration did not contain teachings regarding what ‘should he done.’
Teachings regarding what should he done are meant to lead to the
performance of those acts; and certainly no ìational person can ever
perform what is taught on an imaginary basis.

> “But people might he led to perform it by mistake.”

One man might fall into such a mistake; that the entire world has fallen
into a mistake, and this mistake has persisted ever since the beginning
of creation,—this would certainly be a most extraordinary presumption.
And when it is quite possible that the assertions of Manu, etc., are
based upon the Veda, there is no room for the assumption that in
following them.people have fallen into a mistake. We also do not admit
that Manu and others directly *perceived* the *Dharmas*; because
‘Perception’ is that cognition which follows when the sense-organs are
in contact with the objects cognised; and certainly no such contact with
the sense-organs is possible for *Dharma*, for the simple reason that it
is *what should be done*, and *what should be done* is not an
accomplished entity, and it is only an accomplished entity that comes
into contact with anything. It is true that (though perception does not
apprehend non-existent things) Inference and the other means of
cognition do bring about the apprehension of things *not existent* at
the time,—*e.g*., when people see a line of ants moving along with their
eggs, they infer the *coming* rain; but even these latter means of
cognition do not provide any knowledge of *what should be done*.

All this leads, us to conclude that, in as much as the Recollection
pertains to *what should be done*, it must have a source that is similar
to itself; and such source can be the Veda only. The Veda that we thus
infer (to be the source of the Recollections) must have been directly
perceived by Manu and others and the Vedic texts in which the Dharmas
laid down in the Smṛtis were originally prescribed (and which we do not
find in the Vedas now) must have been contained in such Rescensions as
have been lost.

On this point, the following alternative views suggest themselves as
possible:—

(*a*) The Rescensions may be one or several; and it is inferred that
from among these some contain the injunction of the *Aṣṭakā* and some
that of others. (*b*) Or, it may be that all the Rescensions are
available even at the present day; but the details of the *Dharmas* are
scattered about among them; so that while one Rescension contains the
originative injunction of the *Aṣṭakā*, another contains the injunction
of the substance to be used at it, a third enjoins the Deity, and yet
another lays down the Mantra; and what Manu and other compilers have
done is to bring together in one place all these scattered details, with
a view to make them more easily understood. (*c*) Or, that the Dharmas
in question have their origin only in the indications of Mantras and
Arthavādas. (*d*) Or, these Dharmas, having been performed by men from
time immemorial, and having been handed down by an unbroken line of
tradition, must be regarded to be as eternal as the Veda itself. (*e*)
Or, the action of Manu and others also, like that of ourselves, must
have been based upon the authority of some other source, and as such
their assertions must be based upon such Vedic texts as have always been
assumed by inference (and never actually perceived by any one in any
Veda).

These and such other alternative views have been fully considered by the
author of the *Vivaraṇa*; and the definite conclusion arrived at is as
follows:—The performance of the *Aṣṭakā* and such other acts laid down
in the *Smṛtis* must be regarded as sanctioned by the Veda; because they
are found to be connected with purely Vedic injunctions, on perceiving
which latter the performers undertake the performance. The said
connexion we have already shown above;—in some cases what is prescribed
in the Veda is subservient to what is laid down in the *Smṛti*, and
sometimes it is the contrary; sometimes the Veda contains the
originative Injunction of the act in question, sometimes its qualifying
conditions, and sometimes it lays out a mere *Arthavāda*, an eulogistic
description. In this manner all those acts that are prescribed in the
*Smṛtis* are connected with Vedic injunctions.

We have discussed this matter fully in the as follows:—

‘Between what is laid down in the *Smṛti* and what is prescribed in the
Veda, there is a close connection. There is not much difference between
the two, either as to the character of their performers or to the nature
of the acts themselves. Those same persons who perform the acts
prescribed in the Veda,—if they also do what is mentioned in the Smṛtis,
it follows that these latter have their source in the Veda. The
principal criterion of the authoritative character of a certain text is
its acceptance by persons learned in the Veda; and the fact of the
performing agents being the same in both cases has been put forward (in
the Pūrvamīmānsā Sūtra 1.3.2) as a ground for inferring the existence of
Vedic texts in corroboration of the *Smṛtis*.’

For going any further than this and for coming to particulars (as to
where these corroborative Vedic texts are to be found etc., etc.), there
is no reasonable ground; nor is there any necessity (it being sufficient
for our present purpose that all that is contained in the *Smṛti* has
its source in the Veda).

It is quite possible that certain rescensional texts of the Veda may
have been lost. Even at the present day we find several such texts as
are read by very few students. And some people have held that what the
authors of the *Smṛtis* have done is to bring together the purely
injunctive passages, shorn of their accompanying *arthavādas*, contained
in such rescensional texts as were found by them to be likely to be lost
(for want of learners). Āpastamba (1.4.10) for instance, says—‘the
injunctions are those laid down in the Brāhmaṇas,—their exact words have
been lost—but they can be inferred from the details of the actual
performance.’

But this theory involves many impossible and unheard of assumptions,
such as the neglect of, and the total disappearance of all the learners
of, just that Vedic text which was the most useful, being that in which
were declared all those *Dharmas* pertaining to castes and life-stages
that are set forth in the *Smṛtis* and the *Gṛhyasūtras*.

The other view however is more reasonable,—that learned persons, who
have formed definite conclusions of their own on all important matters,
should compile a practical compendium of all such injunctions as are
scattered over (in various sections of the Veda), beset with
*arthavādas*, and difficult to determine what is conducive to the good
of man and what is meant only to complete the sacrificial performance.

But under this hypothesis also, there is this difficulty, that in cases
where the *Smṛti* rule runs counter to a Vedic rule, hoth would have to
be regarded as equally directly *Vedic*, and as such representing
optional alternatives; so that the *Smṛti* could not be set aside by the
Veda. And this certainly cannot be accepted by the learned. In fact the
authors of the *Smṛtis* themselves admit that the basis of the *Smṛti*
in the Veda is only inferred, and that the former is always set aside in
favour of the latter. For instance, Gautama says (3.35)—‘There is only
one life-stage, say the revered Teachers; since the householder’s life
is the only one that is directly enjoined.’ If Manu and the other
writers (who speak of four life-stages) had actually found the Vedic
texts (upon which they based their division of the four stages),—then
what would be the sense of the expression that ‘the house-holder’s life
is the only one that is directly enjoined (by the Veda)’? For according
to the hypothesis under discussion all the four stages would be equally
*directly enjoined*. \[Nor is the above-quoted *Sūtra* the statement of
a foreign opinion.\] In fact it embodies Gautama’s own opinion, which he
has put forward as the opinion of ‘revered teachers.’ This is clear from
the fact that he has begun the section with the statement ‘Now as
regards the various views that h ave been held regarding the
life-stages’ (3.1), and he has concluded with the Sūtra (3.35) quoted
above.

The authoritative character of *Mantras* and *Arthavādas* (as means of
knowing *Dharma*) is not inconsistent. Though it is true that
*Arthavādas* only serve to eulogise what has been enjoined by an
Injunctive sentence, and they do not exercise the function of enjoining
anything,—yet there are instances in which even the connection of the
*Arthavāda* with an Injunctive sentence is not possible unless the
former has afforded some; idea of an injunction in regard to something
expressed by its words. For instance the *Arthavāda* passage ‘Theft of
gold, drinking of wine, etc., etc.’ (*Upaniṣad*, 5.10.9) cannot be
understood as pertaining to the Injunction of the ‘Science of the Five
Fires,’ until it is known that the ‘theft of gold’ and the rest are
prohibited; the sense of the whole being that ‘he who studies this
science of the Five Fires does not fall, even though he commits the
theft of gold, etc., or associates with persons who have committed
them—otherwise he does fall’?

This is not right; for even though the *Arthavāda* has a distinct
meaning of its own, yet since its connection with the Injunction is
based upon syntactical connection, there can be no room for any
objection as regards syntactical split.

As regards the *Mantras*, they are, by their very nature, indicative of
the form of action; and since the action cannot be got at from any other
sources, we are led to assume an act indicated by the *Mantra*,
specially with a view to justify its indicative character. And since in
connection with the *Aṣṭakā*, it is not possible to have an indication
of such origination and qualifying condition as are absolutely
nonexistent, wo take the *Mantras* as suggestive of the action, its
qualifying condition and its very origination. It is in this way that
Injunctions are accepted as supplied by the words of a *Mantra*. As for
instance, the injunction of the Deity of the *Āghāra* offering (is
supplied by the *Mantra* ‘*Ita Indra urdhva*, etc., etc.’)

It is admitted on all hands that *Dharma* has four ‘feet’; now, it is
only a small portion of this vast fabric of *Dharma* that has been
directly prescribed in the Veda; and the source of the knowledge of all
the remaining factors also must be similar in character to the Veda, for
the simple reason that the factors of *Dharma* can only be known through
some sort of an injunction. So that (directly or indirectly) the
connection (of *Dharma*) with Veda is inevitable.

Now (as regards the work of Manu) what happened was that Manu got
together pupils who had studied several Vedic texts, as also other Vedic
scholars, and having heard from them the several texts, he compiled his
work; and he has therefore clearly stated that Vedic texts are the
source of what he has written, and thereby established the trustworthy
character of his work. Others that came after him performed the several
duties, relying upon Mann’s own words, and did not try to trace his
words to their source (in the Veda). All this is what we infer (from the
circumstances of the case).

Thus even in cases where a *Smṛti* rule may run counter to what is found
to he laid down in the Veda, both must he equally ‘Vedic’ \[since the
*Smṛti* also is based upon Vedic texts actually found by the writer\];
and yet it is quite reasonable that the former should he discarded in
favour of the latter; for when all that we need for the performance of a
certain act is found by us in the Vedic text itself, there is no desire
on our part to seek for, and infer the existence of, any other Vedic
texts (in support of anything that may he found in the *Smṛtis*). Just
as in the case of the *Sāmidhenī* verses, though the two numbers,
*seventeen* and *fifteen*, are both equally mentioned in available Vedic
texts, yet when we have once found that the number *fifteen* is
applicable to the action in hand, we have no desire to have recourse to
the number *seventeen*, even though this also is directly mentioned in
the Veda. Then again, it is only natural that what is directly expressed
by the words of a text should set aside what is only indirectly
indicated by the requirements of what has been directly expressed, this
indicated factor being admittedly remoter and hence weaker than the
directly expressed one. But this does not mean that what is indirectly
indicated has no force at all. In fact such a case would be analogous to
the case where, even though the employment of the details of the
archetypal sacrifice at the ectypal one is admissible by the general
injunction (that ‘the ectype should be performed in the manner of its
archetype’), yet when any such archetypal details are found to be
incompatible with those that may be found to be expressly prescribed
specifically in connection with ectype, the former are unhesitatingly
discarded. \[Similarly when the indicated factor is incompatible with
the expressed one, it is discarded.\]

Under the view \[previously put forward as (*d*)\] that the *Smṛtis* are
based upon an unbroken Unit of performers, the position of the *Smṛtis*
would be no better than that of mere current tradition, which does not,
at any stage (however longstanding it may have become), attain
reliability (based upon direct Vedic support).

The other view \[put forward as (*e*)\] also, according to which Vedic
texts in support of what they did and wrote were always *inferred* by
Manu and others,—does not differ very much from the view that they are
based upon tradition. We have proceeded to examine the source of the
*Smṛti* or Recollection of Manu and others; and if they also only
*inferred* the Vedic texts, just as we are doing now, then, like
ourselves, they also would not be *recollectors* (of Vedic texts). Nor
is it possible to infer a thing that has never been directly perceived
by any one; as no affirmation (and hence no premiss) could be possible
with regard to such a thing. As regards the inference (that has been
cited by Śabara), of the motion (of the Sun) and such other things, a
general connection (between motion and change of location) is always
perceived; or such motion may be deduced from Presumption based on
apparent inconsistency. Such basis of presumption however is not
available in the case in question.

From all this it follows that in the matter of *Dharma*, there is
certainly some sort of connection between Manu and others and the Veda;
but the exact character of this connection we are unable to ascertain.
In fact, when persons learned in the Veda have the firm conviction that
a certain act *should he done*, it is only right to assume that this
conviction is based on the Veda, and not upon a misconception; it is
only thus that wo would be assuming a source of knowledge in keeping
with the character of the knowledge itself. And this assumption rests
upon the possibility of such source being found in Vedic texts, in the
form of *mantras* and *arthavādas* scattered far and wide by reason of
lapses (of time, etc.). In some cases we also find direct Vedic
Injunctions themselves, as the source (of what is found in the *Smṛti*);
*e.g*., the injunction that ‘one should not converse with a woman in her
courses,’ which is found in the Veda in connection with *Upanayana* and
*Study* (supplies the basis for the general prohibition of such
conversation, contained in the *Smṛtis*).

What we have stated here is only a small portion of this vast subject;
more of this should be learnt from the *Smṛtiviveka* \[as follows\]:—

From all this it follows that when Gautama speaks of the Householder’s
Life being ‘directly enjoined’ (by the Veda), what he means is that the
words of the Veda enjoin it directly, without the intervention of any
other process; that which is cognised immediately after the hearing of
the words is said to be ‘directly known’; while after something has been
cognised, if the reflection over the capacities of that thing leads to
the cognition of another thing, this latter is not said to be ‘directly
perceived.’ Thus everything becomes duly established.

-----------------------------------------------

\[Having discussed the idea expressed by the expression ‘*Smṛtiśīle ca
tadvidām*,’ the Author next proceeds to explain the words
themselves\]—‘*Smṛtiśīle tadvidām*’ ‘*the conscientious re-collection of
those versed in the Veda*,’—The compound ‘*smṛtiśīle*’ stands for
‘*Smṛti* and *śīla*.’—‘*Śīla*’ has been explained as the abandoning *of
love and hate*; and this is a ‘root of a Dharma,’—not like the Veda and
Smṛti, which are ‘root of Dharma’ in the sense of being the source of
knowledge of Dharma,—but in the sense that it is a *means of
accomplishing* Dharma; for by abandoning love and hate one acquires
*merit* (Dharma).

*Question*:—“*Dharma* has been described as what leads to welfare; and
certainly the abandoning of love and hate is itself of that character
(of Dharma); so that there being no difference between the two (*i*
.*e*., between *Dharma* and the *abandoning of love and hate*), how can
it be said that the said abandoning *accomplishes Dharma*?”

*Answer*:—We have already pointed out that the authors of *Smṛtis* use
the term ‘*dharma* s,’ ometimes in the sense of *acts* which form the
subjects of Injunctions and Prohibitions (*i.e., meritorious* and
*unmeritorious deeds*), and also sometimes in the sense of that peculiar
thing (force, *i.e*., merit) which proceeds from the performance of acts
and continues to exist until it has brought its reward (to the doer).
That there is such a thing as this latter can be believed only on the
authority of the scriptures. If the sacrificial performance were to
disappear without bringing about any such *force*, then, bow could its
results appear at some remote period of time? It is this peculiar
something that is meant by the term ‘*dharma*’ here \[when it is said
that ‘the abandoning of love and hate accomplishes *Dharma*.’\] And
certainly the said ‘*Śīla*’ is the ‘root’ of ‘Dharma’ in this sense; so
that there is nothing incongruous in this. The use of the word
‘*Dharma*’ in this sense is common; *e.g*., in the verse—‘*Dharma* is
the only friend that accompanies one even on death’ (*Manu*, 8.17).
Since the act disappears immediately after it has been done, bow could
it continue to exist at any other time (as mentioned in this verse)?

Some people bring forward the following objection:—

> “As a matter of fact, everything that is enjoined in the Veda and in
> the Smṛtis is the *source of Dharma*; and since ‘Śīla’ also is
> included among the acts thus enjoined, there is no point in mentioning
> it separately. In fact Manu himself is going to enjoin it in the
> following verse—‘Day and night one should take care to subdue the
> senses’ (7.41),—and again—‘When the mind has been subdued, the two
> groups of five become subdued.’ And it is this ‘subjugation of the
> mind’ which constitutes the ‘abandoning of love and hate,’ as we shall
> explain later on.”

Some writers answer this by saying that ‘*Śīla*’ has been separately
mentioned with a view to indicate its superior importance; it is
something that comes useful in the performance of all acts; and is
important also by itself; being just like the *Agnihotra* and such other
acts; and further, it is a ‘*Dharma*’ for all castes and conditions. It
is for these reasons that it has been specifically mentioned in the
present verse, which sets forth the most general conception of *Dharma*.

Our explanation however is as follows:—‘*Śīla*’ stands for *Samādhi*,
‘composure of the mind;’ the root ‘*Śīl*’ signifies ‘composing,’ and
‘composure’ is a property of the mind; so that ‘*Śīla*’ here stands for
the withdrawing of the mind from other things and concentrating it upon
what is enjoined in the scriptures.

The copulative compound (‘*Smṛtiśīle*’) connotes interdependence; hence
what is meant to be the ‘source of Dharma’ is ‘*Smṛti*’ (Recollection)
and ‘*śīla*’ (composed mind, *Conscience*) as interdependent; and
‘*śīla*’ does not stand for being the *means of accomplishing Dharma*
(as explained by some people, above). The sense therefore comes to be
that what is the ‘source of Dharma’ is *Conscientious Recollection*, and
not mere Recollection. Hence, even though some persons may be ‘versed in
the Veda,’ yet any recollection that they may have at a time when they
are not duly attentive to the subject cannot be regarded as a valid
source of knowledge of Dharma; and this for the simple reason that
unless people have fixed their attention upon what is prescribed in the
scriptures, they are liable to fall into error.

As regards the particle ‘*ca*’ found in the verse, this ‘should be
construed after the term ‘*tadvidām*,’ ‘*of people versed in the Veda*’;
and it is due to the exigencies of metre that it has been placed before
that term. This particle has a copulative force; and since nothing that
has gone before can be copulated, it serves to bring in here the epithet
‘*sādhūnām*’ (good, righteous) that comes next. So that there are three
qualifications intended here: the ‘Recollection’ that is authoritative
is of such persons as (1) are *learned*, having learnt the soiences from
a qualified teacher (), (2) are attentive to what is prescribed in the
scriptures (*śīla*) and (3) are in the habit of acting up to the
injunctions of the scriptures (*sādhu*, good, righteous). It has been
declared that all these qualifications existed in Manu and other writers
(of Smṛtis). If it were not so, then it would never have been possible
for their words to have been accepted by the wise.

> “If this is what is meant, it should be stated dearly, in the form
> ‘the words of Manu and others, are the sources of Dharma’; what is the
> use of setting forth the characteristics (of the writers)?”

True; but there might be persons who may not agree to the words of Manu
and others being authoritative; and it is with reference to such persons
that the text has set forth the well-established grounds for regarding
them as trustworthy. Even, at the present day, a man who is possessed of
the qualifications mentioned in the text, has his words accepted with
the same amount of trust and confidence as the words of Manu and others;
as we find in cases where learned men pronounce their opinion upon the
precise character of the expiatory rite to be performed by one who has
committed a certain sin. In fact a person possessed of the said
qualifications has ever been recognised as constituting the ‘*pariṣad*’
‘court,’ by himself alone: ‘The Brāhmaṇa should act up to that Dharma
which even a single person learned in the Vedas should declare to be
Dharma’—says Manu (12.113). For these reasons, there can be no
reasonable ground for enumerating the names of ‘Recollectors,’ as ‘Manu,
Viṣṇu, Yama, Aṅgiras’ and so forth. For we find that many such persons
as *Paiṭhīnasi, Baudhāyana, Pracetas* and the rest are recognised by the
wise and learned as reliable ‘Recollectors,’ and yet these names are not
found in any of the lists (supplied by various Smṛtis).

What thus the words ‘*Smṛtiśīle ca tadvidām*’ mean is that ‘when a
person is found to be recognised and spoken of by all wise and learned
persons as endowed with the said qualifications, and they also accept a
certain work as really by that person,—the word of such a person (and of
the work composed by him), even though proceeding from a human source,
should be recognised as an authoritative source of the knowledge of
Dharma. So that even at the present day if there were a person possessed
of the said qualifications, and he were to compose a work by reason of
just those qualifications, then for later generations they would be
accepted to be just as authoritative as the words of Manu and others.
People of the present generation—who would be contemporaries of the said
writer—would not derive their knowledge of *Dharma* from the words of
such a writer, because the sources of information available to him would
be all available to them also. Hence it is that until a teacher of the
present day clearly indicates the source from which he has derived a
certain information, learned people do not accept his word as reliable.
When however he has pointed out his source and his work has been
accepted as authoritative, then at some future time if the case of his
work be found to be analogous to that of the *Smṛti* rules regarding
*Aṣṭakā* and other acts (whose basis in the Veda we of the present day
cannot find), it would be only right to infer its authoritative
character from the fact of its being accepted by the wise and the
learned (which fact could not be explained except on the basis of its
being duly authoritative).

-----------------------------------------------

‘*Ācārascaiva sādhūnām*’ ‘*The practice of Good Men*’;—the particle
‘*ca*’ connects the epithet ‘*vedavidām*’ (*of persons versed in the
Veda*) with this phrase also. These two qualifications (‘goodness’ and
‘Vedic learning’) indicate the ‘*Śiṣṭa*,’ ‘the cultured man.’ The
‘practice of cultured men’ also is ‘source of Dharma.’—‘*Practice*’
means *conduct*, *behaviour*. When, in regard to any action, there are
no Vedic or Smṛti statements, but cultured men are found to regard it as
‘Dharma’ and do it,—then that act also should be accepted as ‘enjoined
by the Veda,’ just like the act prescribed in the *Smṛti*. To this
category belong such acts as the following—(*a*) the tying of the
bracelet and such other auspicious rites performed during marriage,
etc., (*b*) the worshipping of famous trees, Yakṣas, road-crossings and
such things, varying in various countries, done by the girl on her day
of marriage, (*c*) the number of hair-locks kept on the head, varying
with different countries; (*d*) the exact manner of attending on guests,
teachers and other respectable persons, consisting in the addressing of
sweet and agreeable words, saluting, rising to receive and so forth; for
instance, it is customary with some people to recite the *Pṛṣṇi-sūkta*
with grass in hand, when banding over the horse consecrated for the
*Aśvamedha* sacrifice. It is such customs that are meant by ‘Practice’
here. It is not possible to collect in any compilation all such
practices, there being endless forms of them, varying with the
diversities in the nature of men, caused by such variable circumstances
as the calm or disturbed condition of their mind and so forth. The same
act that may have been found, on several, occasions, to be pleasing (to
one person), may, on another occasion, turn out to be unpleasant (to
another person). For instance, a house-holder may be in the habit of
being in constant attendance upon his guests;—this may be quite pleasing
to one guest, who may be pleased at finding the man attending upon him
like a servant; but the same close attendance becomes unpleasant to
another guest, who may feel—‘the feeling of restraint caused by this
man’s constant presence is so galling that I do not find an opportunity
to sit at ease.’ Hence, in corroboration of such ‘Practices’ it is not
possible for us to assume Vedic texts, corroborating them either
collectively or individually. The *Aṣṭakā* and such other acts, on the
other band, have a fixed form; and hence we have *Smṛti* rules regarding
their performance. This is what constitutes the difference between
‘Recollection’ and ‘Practice’ (*Smṛti* and *Ācāra*).

-----------------------------------------------

‘*Ātmanastuṣṭireva ca*’,—‘*Self-satisfaction also*’—‘*is source of
Dharma*’ is to be construed here also. This ‘*self-satisfaction*’ also
is meant to be of those only who are ‘learned in the Veda and Good’
(‘*Vedavidām sādhūnām*’). The fact of this ‘Self-satisfaction’ being
‘source of Dharma’ has been held to be based upon the trustworthy
character (of the people concerned). When such persons as are possessed
of the stated qualifications (of being *good* and *learned*) have their
mind satisfied with a certain act, and they do not feel any aversion
towards it, that act is ‘*Dharma*.’

> “But it may happen that a man’s mind is satisfied with a prohibited
> (sinful) act; and this would have to be regarded as *Dharma*. Again, a
> man may have hesitation (and doubt) regarding what is enjoined in the
> Veda; and this latter would h ave to be regarded as *n* *ot*‘
> *Dharma*.’”

(*a*) As a matter of fact, the ‘self-satisfaction’ of the high-souled
and extremely good men endowed with the said qualifications, is
possessed of such tremendous force that, under its influence ‘*Dharma*’
may become ‘*Adharma*’ and ‘*Adharma*’ become ‘*Dharma*’; but this
cannot be so in the case of men tainted with love and hate, etc.
Whatever goes into a salt-mine, becomes transformed into salt; similarly
everything is rendered pure by the unpremeditated ‘self-satisfaction’ of
persons learned in the Veda. \[The mere fact of an act being prohibited
does dot make it *Adharma* \] for though the ‘holding of the *Ṣoḍaśi*
vessel’ has been prohibited at the *Atirātra* sacrifice, yet when the
holding comes to be done, in accordance With a Vedic injunction, it is
not sinful. But in the present case, there is no question of option, as
there is in the case of the ‘holding of the *Ṣoḍaśi*’. What happens in
this case is that the Prohibitions take effect in regard to all cases
except the one that falls within tho purview of the said
‘self-satisfaction.’

(*b*) Or (the second answer to the objection is that), people like those
mentioned in the verse can never feel any self-satisfaction at what is
‘*Adharma*.’ The mongoose bites only that herb which is an antidote of
poison, and not any other herb; hence the notion that ‘whatever herb is
bitten by the mongoose is destructive of poison.’

(*c*) (*Thirdly*) The revered teachers have explained as follows:—What
is meant is that, in cases of optional alternatives, that alternative
should be adopted in regard to which the mind feels satisfied. It is in
accordance with this that the Author will say later on, in connection
with the purification of things and expiatory rites—‘the penance should
be performed until the mind may feel satisfied.’

(*d*) Or, what is said in the Text may be taken as ruling out the
unbelieving Atheist; as a matter of fact, the Atheist does not feel any
‘self-satisfaotion’ in doing even those aots that are enjoined in the
Veda; hence such acts though done by him are absolutely useless.

(*e*) Or, what the Text teaches is that in the performance of all acts,
one should have a tranquil mind; *i.e.*, at the time of doing anything
one should keep his mind free from anger, stupefaction, grief and so
forth, and should remain happy. Hence like ‘Śīla’ this also is laid down
as pertaining to all acts.

*Cf*. Āpastamba, 1.1.11.1—3; Gautama, 1.1—4 and 28. 48; Vaśiṣṭha, 1.
4—6; Baudhāyana, 1.1.1.1—6; Yājñavalkya, 1.7.

The meaning of ‘*Śīla*’ and ‘*Ācāra*’ separately has been the source of
much misunderstanding. The difficulty has been solved by Medhātithi
taking the term ‘*Smṛtiśīle*, as standing, not for ‘Smṛti’ *and*
‘Śīla,’but for ‘Smṛti’ *as qualified by* ‘Śīla,’ this being ‘freedom
from hatred and attachment;’ ‘*Smṛti—Śīla*’ stands for that ‘Smṛti,’
recollection, which the learned have when their mind is calm and
collected, not perturbed by passions of any kind. The reason suggested
by Buhler is not satisfactory.

Kullūka has explained ‘*Śīla*’ as standing for the virtues enumerated by
Hārīta—‘Brāhmaṇa-like behaviour, devotion to gods and Pitṛs, gentility,
kindness, freedom from jealousy, sympathy, absence of cruelty,
friendliness, agreeable speech, gratefulness, being prepared to grant
shelter, mercy, and calmness.’ Nārāyaṇa puts it vaguely as ‘that to
which learned men are prone.’

‘*Self-satisfaction*’—This is meant to apply to cases where the
scriptures provide options (Medhātithi, Govindarāja and Kullūka);—or to
cases not covered by any of the aforesaid sources (Nārāyaṇa and
Nandana).

In connection with this verse, the student desirous of carrying on
further investigation, is advised to read Kumārila’s Tantravārtika,
Adhyāya I (Translation—*Bibliotheca Indica*).

*Medhātithi* (p. 57, l. 8)—‘*Viśvajitā*’—See Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 4.3.15—10.

*Medhātithi* (p. 57, l. 20)—‘*Kvachidarthavādādeva*’—for an example, see
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 1.4.29.

*Medhātithi* (p. 60, l. 29)—‘*Kartṛsāmānyāt*’—This refers to Mīmāṃsā
Sūtra 1.3.2.

*Medhātithi* (p. 62, l. 2) — ‘*Yathā āghāre devatāvidhiḥ*—Śabara on
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra 2.2.10 says—

> *\[ādhāre\] māntravarṇako devatāvidhiḥ* \| *ita indra ūrdhvo'dhvaro
> divi...indravāna svāhesyādhāramādhārayati—ityevamasāvādhāro
> yadyasyendro devatā*

*Medhātithi* (p. 60, ll. 7-8) ‘*Tulye śrautatve*’—Though in regarding
both the Śruti-rule and the Smṛti-rule to be equally ‘Śrauta,’
‘Vedic’—Medhātithi apparently accepts the view of Kümārila as against
Śabara (according to whom’ the Smṛti-rule is not *Śruti*, but stands on
a distinctly inferior footing),—ultimately his view comes to be the same
as Śabara’s—*viz*., that in case of conflict between *Śruti* and
*Smṛti*, the latter is set aside in favour of the former; while
according to Kumārila, there is option.

*Medhātithi* (p. 63, l. 1)—‘*Viśvajityodhikāravat*’—See Mīmāṃsā Sūtra
6.7.18—19. In connection with the Viśvajit sacrifice we have the
text—‘one should give away his *entire property*, *sarvasva*.’ The
conclusion is that the injunction of the giving away of one’s entire
property having been already found in connection with the
*Jyotiṣṭoma*,—at which one is bound to pay as fee either 1,200 gold
pieces or his entire property,—what the mention of the giving of entire
property at the *Viśvajit* means is that at this latter sacrifice, the
fee must consist of the *entire property*, and not of 1,200 gold pieces;
and this has been taken to imply that the man who seeks to perform the
*Viśvajit* must possess more than 1,200 gold pieces.

*Medhātithi* (p. 64, 1. 4)—‘*Indriyāṇām &c*’—The first part of this
quotation occurs in Manu 7. 44; but the second half is from some other
work.

This verse has been quoted in the *Vidhānapārijāta* (vol. II, p. 511) in
support of the authority of *Sadāchāra*, as bearing upon the propriety
of *tasamudrādhāraṇa*;—also in the *Smṛtikaumudī* (p. 1) which remarks
that the Practice of cultured men is authoritative only when it is not
repugnant to Śruti and Smṛti.

The *Aparārka* (p. 82) quotes the verse in support of the view that the
Practices of Good Men also, as distinct from the Smṛti, are an
authoritative source of our knowledge of Dharma. It is interesting to
note that it reads *vedavitsmṛtiśīlatā* in place of *ātmanastuṣṭireva
ca*.

It is quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 5), which adds the
following explanation:—

Veda is the means of knowing Dharma; so also are the ‘Smṛti’ and
‘Śīla’—*i.e*. freedom from love and hate,—of persons learned in the
Veda;—‘*āchāra*’ such as the tying of the bracelet and so forth;—and
‘*ātmatuṣṭi*’, *i. e*., when there are several options open to us, it is
our own satisfaction that should determine the choice of one of
them;—also in the *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 17b);—and in *Hemādri*
(Vrata, p. 17).

This is quoted in the *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣa, p. 10), which adds the
following notes:—

‘Vedaḥ’ is the collection of Mantra and Brāhmaṇa texts, as defined by
Āpastamba;—‘*akhilaḥ*’, the actual texts available, as also those
presumed on the strength of ‘transference’ and that of ‘Indicative
Power’, ‘Syntactical Connection’, ‘Contest’, ‘Position’ and ‘Name’
(Jaimini iii);—or ‘*akhilaḥ*,’ ‘entire,’ may be taken as meant to
preclude the notion that the said authority belongs only to the three
Vedas, and *not* to the Atharva’, which is based upon such assertions of
Āpastamba and others as ‘Yajña is enjoined by the *three* Vedas’. That
the ‘Atharva is an authority for Dharma is due to the fact that it
prescribes the performance of the *Tulāpuruṣa* and other propitiatory
rites for all castes, even though it does not deal mainly with the
performance of the Agnihotra or other *Śrauta* rites.—When the text says
that these are the means of knowing ‘*Dharma*’ *Right*, it implies that
they are the means of knowing also what is ‘*Adharma*,’ ‘*wrong*’ it
being necessary for the scriptures to furnish an idea of all that is
*wrong* and hence a source of impurity of the mind, which obstructs the
acquiring of true knowledge.—‘*Mūlam*’, ‘Source’, the means of
knowing;—‘*Todvidām*’, those learned in the Veda; this implies that in
the case of ‘*Smṛti*’ and the rest, tḥe authority is not inherent in
themselves, but due to their being based upon the Veda—

‘*Smṛti*’ the *Dharmaśāstra* compiled by Yājñavalkya and
others.—‘*Śīla*’ implies the thirteen qualities enumerated by
Hārīta—*viz*., Faith in Brahman, Devotion to Gods and Pitṛs, Gentility,
Harmlessness, Freedom from jealousy, Freedom from harshness,
Friendliness, Sweetness of speech, Gratefulness, Kindness for sufferers,
Sympathy, Calmness. This ‘*Śīla*’ differs from ‘Ācāra’; it stands for
the negative virtues, the *avoidance of wrong*, while the former stands
for the positive active virtues; the doing of right.—‘*Ācāra*’, the
tying of the bracelet during marriage and so forth.—‘*Sādhūnam
atmanastuṣṭiḥ*’, whenever doubt arises regarding what is right, what
determines the question is the ‘self-satisfaction’ of those that are
‘*Sādhu’ i. e*., have their minds replete with the knowledge of the Veda
and the impressions gathered therefrom; *i*. *e*., that course is to be
accepted as ‘light’, which commands the unanimous approval of the said
persons;—such is the explanation suggested by the *Kalpataru*. In
support of this view we have the following passage from the
*Taittirīya*, relating to cases of doubt regarding Dharma,—‘Thou
shouldst behave in that manner in which behave those Brāhmaṇas who are
impartial, honest, steady, calm and righteous.’ This implies the
authority of the *Pariṣat* ‘Assembly’.—Or ‘*sādhūnām*’ may be construed
with ‘*āchāraḥ*’, which would imply the authority also of those ‘good
men’—men free from all evil qualities,—who are not ‘learned in the
Veda’; so that for superior *Śūdras*, the practices of their forefathers
would be authoritative.—‘Self-satisfaction’ is the determining factor in
the case of options; but this is an authority for the man himself, not
for others.

**(Verses 6, 10 and 12)  
**

*Baudhāyana, Dharmasūtra*, 1.1.6.—‘Dharma has been enjoined in each
Veda.’ ‘The second source of knowledge consists of the Smṛtis.’ ‘The
third is what proceeds from the cultured, *i. e*., those persons who are
free from jealousy and selfishness, fairly well off, free from avarice,
haughtiness, greed, delusion, and anger.’ ‘Those persons are *cultured*
who have studied the Vedas along with their supplements and who are
versed in the art of making deductions from them; those are the persons
from whom the direct knowledge of Śruti can be derived.’

*Gautama*, *Dharmasūtra*, 1.1-2.—‘Veda is the source of Dharma’: ‘the
*Smṛti* and *Śīla* of persons learned in the Veda.’

*Āpastamba, Dharmasūtra*, 1.2-3.—‘The convention of persons knowing
Dharma is authoritative’: ‘and also the Vedas.’

*Vaśiṣṭha, Smrti*, 1.4-6.—‘In the absence of Śruti and Smṛti, the custom
of the cultured is authoritative’: ‘those persons are *cultured* whose
mind is free from selfish desires’: ‘that is to be regarded as Dharma
which is not prompted by a selfish motive.’

*Yajñavalkya, Smṛti*, 1-7.—‘Śruti, Smṛti, the practice of good men,
self-satisfaction determination based upon right volition,—these four
are the source of Dharma.’

*Āpastamba, Dharmasūtra*, 1.4.7.—‘The Śruti is more authoritative than
custom which derives its authority only from assumption (of
corroboration of Śruti).’

*Ibid*, 30.9.—‘In cases of conflict, what is stated in the Śruti is more
authoritative.’

*Jaimini*, the writer of the Mīmāṃsā-sūtra (1.1.2), has emphatically
declared that the Vedic Injunction is the only trustworthy source of our
knowledge of Dharma, *i.e*., of what is *right*, *i.e*., what is
conducive to good, temporal and spiritual (Vaiśeṣika-Sütra 1.1.2);
though he knew of the later ‘lawbooks, Smṛtis, and customs,’ yet he had
no hesitation in declaring that these are to be relied upon only so far
as they are not repugnant to anything declared in the Veda.

Coming to the strictly legal writers we find—1. Baudhāyana, (1.1.1-6)
naming—(*a*) *Veda*, (*b*) the *Smṛti*, and (2) ‘*Śiṣṭāgama*,’—the
‘*Āgama*,’ teaching, of the ‘*Śiṣṭas*’ ‘cultured’ men;—*i*. *e*., ‘those
who are free from ill-feeling, devoid of vanity, possessed of sufficient
grain, not greedy, devoid of hypocrisy, haughtiness, avarice, stupidity
and anger;—those who have studied, in the right manner, the Veda along
with its supplements and are well versed in making deductions out of
them.’

\[There is no mention of ‘custom’ here at all. It is ‘scripture’ pure
and simple; but no longer the Veda only, but also the *Smṛtis*, and the
deductions therefrom and *teachings* based thereupon by persons with
very special qualifications.\]

*Parāśara*, 1.20.—‘At the beginning of each Kalpa, there appear Brahmā,
Viṣṇu and Śiva......... the propounders of (1) *Śruti*, (2) *Smṛti* and
(3) *Sadāchāra*.’

> *kalpe kalpe kṣayotyattau brahmaviṣṇumaheśvarāḥ* \|  
> *śrutismṛtisadācāranirṇetāraśva sarvadā* \|\|

To the same end we have Āpastamba (1.1.2-3) declaring that the
‘convention or opinion of those versed in Dharma’ and ‘also the Veda,’
are the authority. It only means that when those learned in Dharma are
agreed in regard to the righteousness of a certain course of action,
that is to be accepted as authoritative.

This is made clear by Vaśiṣṭha (1.4-6)—‘In the event of the aforesaid’
(*i.e*., Śruti and Smṛti) not being available, the *practice of cultured
men* is the authority,—the cultured man being defined as one who is
entirely unselfish, having no desires of his own.

The same opinion is expressed more definitely by Gautama (1.1.
1-2)—‘Veda is the source of Dharma, also the *Smṛti* (Recollection) and
*Śīla* of those learned in the Veda.’

\[In all this ‘custom’ begins to be admitted; but only that of the
‘cultured.’\]

The next step in advance is taken by Manu (2.6)—

> *vido'khilo dharmamūlaṃ smṛtiśīle ca tadvidām* \|  
> *ācāraśvaica sādhūnāmātmanastuṣṭireva ca* \|\|

Also *Vyāsa*—

> *dharmamūlaṃ vedamāhuḥ grantharāśimakṛtrimam* \|  
> *tadvidāṃ smṛtiśīle ca sādhvācāraṃ manaḥpriyam* \|\|

By this the sources of Dharma are (1) *Veda*, (2) *Smṛti*, (3)
*Sadāchāra* and (4) ‘*Svasya priyam*.’

\[What is exactly meant by these terms we shall see later on.\] The same
is recapitulated in Manu (2.12)—

> *vedaḥ smṛtiḥ sadācāraḥ svasya ca priyamātmanaḥ* \|  
> *etaccaturvidhaṃ prāhuḥ sākṣāddharmasya lakṣaṇam* \|\|

This is slightly improved upon by Yājñavalkya (1.7)—

> *śrutiḥ smṛtiḥ sadācāraḥ svasya ca priyamātmanaḥ* \|  
> *samyaksaṅkalpajaḥ kāmo dharmamūlamidaṃ smṛtam* \|\|

By which the sources of law are fivefold:—(1) *Veda*, (2) *Smṛti*, (3)
*Sadāchāra*, (1) *Svasya priyam* and (5) *Samyak-saṅkalpaja Kāma*. \[For
the exact signification of these, see below.\]

Thus the sources of Law are: (1) ‘*Śruti*,’ (2) ‘*Smrti*’ (3)
‘*Sadāchāra*’—‘practices of the good’ (with regard to these there is
unanimity among all old authorities), (4) ‘*Svasya priyam*’ or
‘*ātmanastuṣṭiḥ*,’ ‘self-satisfaction.’ In regard to the fourth also
Manu and Yājñavalkya are agreed. In Manu however we find one thing more,
which is not found in Yājñavalkya—*viz*., ‘*Sīla*’; and Yājñavalkya
speaks of ‘*Samyaksaṅkalpajaḥ kāmaḥ*,’ which is not found in Manu.
Vīramitrodaya on Yājña has identified these two.

We shall see now what these terms mean according to the Commentators and
the more important Digest-writers.



####### (A) Śruti

*Medhātithi on Manu*, 2.6.—The word ‘Veda’ stands for the Ṛgveda,
Yajurveda, and Sāmaveda (also Atharva Veda), along with their respective
Brāhmaṇas, There are 21 Recensions of the Ṛgveda, 100 of the Yajurveda,
1,000 of the Sāmaveda and 9 of the Atharvaveda. The Vedic character of
the Atharva cannot be denied, because, like the other Vedas, this also
is not the work of a human author, it helps to make known man’s duties,
it is free from mistakes, it prescribes the Jyotiṣṭoma and such other
rites exactly in the same manner as the other Vedas do. \[This is denied
by Vīramitrodaya on Yājñavalkya; see below.\] Though there are certain
texts that forbid the study of the Atharva Veda, yet all that this means
is that one should not confuse the teachings of the other Vedas with
those of the Atharva; for instance, at the performance of rites in
accordance with the three other Vedas, one should not use Mantras of the
Atharva Veda.

This ‘Veda’ is the ‘root,’ *i.e*., source, cause, of dharma, in the
sense that it *makes it known*, and it does this by means chiefly of
such passages in the *Brāhmaṇas* as contain injunctive expressions;
sometimes also by means of *Mantras*. And the other parts of the
Veda—the Arthavāda or Declamatory Passages—have their use in eulogising
what is enjoined by the corresponding injunction; Mantras and names help
in indicating the details of the acts prescribed.

*Sarvajñanārāyaṇa on Manu*, 26.—When Manu speaks of the ‘*entire Veda*,’
he means to include the *Arthavādas*, commendatory and condemnatory
exaggerations, also.

*Kullūka on Manu*, 26.—‘Veda’ stands for the Ṛk, Yajus, Sāman and
Atharvan; the whole of these, including the injunctions, Mantras and
Arthavādas, the last also serving the purpose of helping the injunction
by persuasion. Both Mantras and Arthavādas serve the useful purpose not
only of persuasion, but also of reminding the agent of the details of
the action undertaken. The authority of *Śruti* and the rest also rests
upon.the fact of their having their source in the Veda.

*Rāghavānanda on Manu*, 2.6.—Ṛk, Yajus, Sāman and Atharvan are the
authority for Dharma.

*Viśvarūpa on Yājña*, 1.3-7.—‘Śruti’ is to be taken, not in the strictly
limited sense of the ‘Mantra and Brāhmaṇa texts,’ but for all the
fourteen ‘Sciences’—the Four Vedas, their six ‘subsidiaries’ or ‘limbs,’
Purāṇa, Nyāya, Mīmānsā, and Dharmaśāstra.

*Mitākṣarā on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘*Śruti*’ is Veda.

\(I\) *Aparārka on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘Śruti’ is *Veda*—it is the only
determining factor in all matters relating to the Agnihotra and other
rites. As Vyāsa says, this is the only *pure* authority (*i.e*.,
entirely trustworthy), all the rest being ‘adulterated,’ *i.e*., of
doubtful authority; that law is the highest which is learnt from the
Veda, what is propounded in the Purāṇas and other works being of a lower
grade.

Says Manu—‘The Veda embodies all knowledge’ (2.7).

‘The learned man should enter upon his own duties, resting upon the
authority of the Revealed Word’ (2.8). ‘The Veda should be known as the
Revealed Word, Śruti’ (2.10).

*Vīramitrodaya-Tīkā on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘Śruti’ is *Veda*—as in Manu (2.10).
It is the sole authority in regard to *Agnihotra* and such rites.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, pp. 8-25.—‘Śruti’ stands for ‘Veda,’ which,
according to Āpastamba’s definition, is the name given to the
‘collection of Mantra and Brāhmaṇa texts’;—the ‘whole’ of this
authoritative, *i.e*., the direct, texts themselves, as also those that
are deducible from the implications of ‘Indication,’ ‘Syntactical
Connection,’ ‘Context,’ ‘Position’ and ‘Name,’ and also the
transformations undergone by the original texts under well-recognised
principles. Another implication of the epithet ‘entire’ is that the
*Atharva Veda* also is to be accepted as authoritative, and not only the
‘trinity of Vedas,’ as one might be led to suppose from the words of
Āpastamba, who says that ‘Dharma is to be learnt from the three Vedas.’
It would be wrong to deny the authority of the Atharva Veda, because,
even though it has nothing to say regarding the setting up of the
Sacrificial Pires or the details of the Agnihotra and other rites, yet
on certain matters it is our only authority; such propitiatory rites for
instance as those relating to the ‘Tulāpuruṣa’ and the like, which
affect all the castes. When we speak of these being the ‘source of
dharma,’ ‘means of knowing what Dharma, Right, is,’ it follows that they
are the means of knowing also what ‘Adharma’ ‘wrong’ is; it is necessary
to understand what is ‘wrong’ in order to discard it and thereby prepare
the mind for perceiving what is ‘right.’

This ‘Śruti’ operates in the following seven forms:

\(1\) The Injunction or Mandatory text—*e.g*., ‘one shall sacrifice the
goat to Yāyu’—this is a trustworthy guide as to what one should do.

\(2\) The Prohibitive Text—*e.g*., ‘one shall not eat the flesh of an
animal killed by the poisoned arrow this is a guide as to what one shall
avoid.

\(3\) The ‘Declamatory’ text of two kinds: the commendatory and the
condemnatory; the former serves the purpose of delineating the
excellence of the course of action enjoined by the Mandatory text;
*e.g*., the text ‘Vāyu is the eftest deity,’ serves to indicate the
excellent properties of the deity Vāyu to whom the offering of the goat
has been enjoined; the condemnatory text serves to deprecate the course
of action prohibited; *e.g*., the assertion that ‘the tears of weeping
Rudra became silver’ is meant to deprecate the giving of silver as the
sacrificial fee, which has been forbidden by a prohibitive text. Texts
of this declamatory kind are of use sometimes in settling a doubtful
point: *e.g*., it having been enjoined that one should place *wet
pebbles* under the altar, and the injunction being silent as to the
substance with which the pebble is to be wetted, the doubt on this point
is settled by a subsequent ‘declamatory’ text, ‘clarified butter is
glory itself,’ which clearly indicates the clarified butter as the
substance with which the pebbles are to be wetted.

\(4\) The *Mantra* text—*e.g*., ‘*Devasya tvā savituḥ*,’ etc., serves to
remind the performer of the details of the performance in the shape of
the deity and so forth.

\(5\) The proper names of particular sacrifices help in the determining
of the exact action connoted by the common root ‘*yaji*,’ ‘to sacrifice’
occurring in the injunctive text.

\(6\) The meaningless syllables, *stobhas*, introduced in the
Sāma-chant, serve the purpose of marking time and cadence;

and (7) the Upaniṣad text serves to promulgate that knowledge of Brahman
which destroys all evil.

*Parāśara*, 1-20—speaks of the ‘propounders of Śruti’ appearing at the
beginning of each *kalpa*. From the words it would seem as if the three
gods—Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Maheśvara were the said ‘propounders.’ But
Mādhava (p. 98) takes the ‘propounders of Śruti, Smṛti and Sadāchāra’
separately from Brahmā, etc., and he supplies a peculiar account of the
‘propounders of Śruti’—which extends the scope of the authority of this
source of knowledge. He says that by the ‘propounders of Śruti’ here are
meant

\(1\) *Vyāsa*, who divided the Vedic text into the several recensions;

\(2\) the expounders of those Recensions—such as Kaṭha and Kuthuma;

\(3\) the contents of Kalpasūtras, such as Baudhāyana, Āśvalāyana, aud
Āpastamba, and also the ‘*authors*’ of the Mīmāṃsāsūtras, Jaimini and
the rest.

*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda-Saṃskara-Sāra MSS*.—The Veda is the main authority for
Dharma. Any inconsistencies that may be found in it can be easily
explained away. This authority belongs not only to the Injunctions, but
also to Mantras, names and declamatory passages.

*Smṛticandrikā*, p. 3.—The Veda is authoritative as it is independent of
human authorship.



####### (B) Smṛti

*Medhātithi on Manu, 2.6*.—‘*Smṛti*’ is Recollection and ‘*Śīla*’
denotes freedom from love, hatred and such improper feelings; this
latter, according to one explanation, is a means of *accomplishing
Dharma*, and not a means of *knowing it*; and it has been separately
mentioned in the present connection only with a view to emphasise its
importance. Not satisfied with this, he has taken the two terras
‘*Smṛti*’ and ‘*Śīla*’ in the compound as inter-related; and as together
standing for a single *means of knowing Dharma*, in the shape of
‘Recollection during that state of the mind when it is calm, free from
all disturbing influences of love, hatred and so forth’,—i.e.,
‘Conscientious Recollection.’ The authority of ‘Smṛti’ thus becomes
qualified. Even though a certain writer may be a *Ṛṣi* versed in Veda,
yet if his ‘recollection’ and its compilation come about at a time when
his mind was perturbed by discordant feelings, much trust cannot be
placed upon such ‘Recollection.’

This again has to be taken along with ‘*Sādhūmām*’; so that we have a
threefold condition for the trustworthiness of a writer of Smṛti:—

1.  he must be *learned* (‘*tādvidām*’),
2.  he must be ‘conscientious,’ ‘free from love and hatred’ (‘*Śīla*’),
3.  and he must be ‘righteous’ (‘*Sādhūmām*’), be habitually engaged in
    carrying out the injunctions of the Veda.

The upshot of the whole is that when a person is found to be recognised
and spoken of by all wise and learned persons as endowed with the said
three qualifications—and a certain compilation is also recognised as
made by that person,—the word of such a person as found in his
recognised work, should be recognised as an authoritative exponent of
Dharma. Sc that even at the present day if there were such a person and
he were to compose a work, then for all later generations that work
would be regarded just as highly as those of Manu and others. This is
the reason why Medhātithi is averse to the practice of enumerating the
authoritative ‘Smṛtis.’ (Trans., p. 204.)

*Sarvajñanārāyaṇa on Manu*, 2.6.—In cases where no Vedic texts are
available, the law can be determined with the help of the *Smṛti* of
persons learned in the Veda—the term ‘*Smṛti*’ standing for the
reflections over a certain subject, as also the treatises embodying
those reflections.

*Kullūka on Manu*, 2.6.—The Smṛti of ‘*persons learned in the Veda*’ is
authoritative,—this last qualification being added for the purpose of
indicating that the authority of Smṛti is due to its having its source
in the Veda.

*Rāghavānanda on Manu*, 2.6.—‘*Smṛti*’ stands for the work of Manu and
others. It stands here for only such *Smṛti* as is not incompatible with
tho Veda. All the rest are to be rejected whenever they are found to be
repugnant to any direct text of the Veda. But where there is no such
repugnance, we are justified in assuming that the Smṛti must be based
upon a Vedic text now lost to us; and it is on this assumption that its
trustworthiness rests.

*Nandana on Manu*, 2.6.—The ‘Smṛti of men learned in the Veda.’ This
stands for *Smṛtis, Purāṇas* and *Itihāsas*.

*Viśvarūpa on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘Smṛti’ and ‘Dharmaśāstra’ are synonymous
terms. “How do we know that the *Smṛtis* are all *based upon the Veda*,
from which they derive their authority? Certainly we do not find Vedic
texts in support of everything that is ordained in the Smṛtis. As for
the Vedic texts that are found to support some Smṛti assertions, such
support is found also in the case of the heterodox scriptures.”—The
simple answer to this question is that in the face of the direct
assertion of Manu and other Smṛti-writers that their work is ‘based on
the Veda,’ we have no justification for thinking otherwise. They being
great Vedic scholars, could not have lied on this point. As a matter of
fact also we find that every one of the injunctions contained in the
Smṛtis has its source in the Veda; in some cases the connection is
*direct*, in others *indirect*; for instance, we have the single Vedic
injunction ‘one should study the Veda’; now studying is not possible
without *teaching*, hence the injunction of teaching is implied by the
former—the *teaching* cannot be done without some one to teach; this
implies the receiving and initiating of a pupil; this implies the
necessity of having children; this again that of *marrying* and so on;
most of the other injunctions may have their source traced in the single
Vedic text.

\(I\) *Aparārka on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘Smṛti’ is that ordinance which, in
matters relating to Dharma, has its source in the Veda; its authority is
‘adulterated,’ *i.e*., not so absolute as that of *Śruti*; it supplies
us with information regarding the duties of all castes and the four
life-stages; one should carefully do all that has been ordained,
*Smṛtam*, by persons most learned in the Veda and eschew what is
forbidden by them. \[This writer like Kumārila makes a distinction
between ‘Smṛti’ and ‘Purāṇa.’\] There are chances of our going astray in
the matter of interpreting a Vedic text and learning the law from it;
but there is no fear of any such mistake being committed by the
Smṛti-writers who were thoroughly well-versed in the Vedic lore. \[From
this it would seem that this writer flourished during the transition
period, when the centre of gravity was beginning to shift from the Veda
towards the Smṛti.\]

*Mitākṣarā on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘*Smrti*’ is Dharmaśāstra.

*Vīramitrodaya on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘*Smṛti*’ is ‘Dharmaśāstra’—‘Legal
Ordinances’ (Manu 2-10); it is the sole authority regarding the *Aṣṭakā*
and such rites.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, pp. 8-25.—‘Of persons learned in the Veda’;
this has been added with a view to make clear that the authority of the
Smṛtis does not rest upon themselves: it is derived entirely from the
fact of their having their source in the Veda. The name ‘Smṛti’ stands
for the legal ordinances, ‘Dharmaśāstra,’ compiled by Yājñavalkya and
others.

*Madanapārijāta*, p. 11.—Manu is the most important of the expounders of
law. Among others, some are mentioned by Yājñavalkya (see above). But
this list is not exhaustive. Though all these ‘expounders’ do not always
agree, yet, on the main principles, they are all agreed; the
differences, if any, are confined to minor points; and these latter
discrepancies can always he explained.

*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda-Saṃskāra MSS*.—“How can any authority attach to the
Smṛtis of Manu and others, which being of human origin are open to the
suspicion of the possibility of all those defects to which human writers
are liable; and for this reason these cannot be regarded as
authoritative in the same manner as the Vedas are, whose authority is
above suspicion.”—The answer to this is that inasmuch as these Smṛtis
are found to be mere reproductions of what is contained in the Veda,
they must be regarded as duly authoritative. The very name ‘Smṛti,’
‘Recollection,’ implies that they only reproduce what the authors have
learnt elsewhere; and as Manu and others are known to have been learned
in the Veda it stands to reason that knowing as they did that the Veda
was the sole authority on Dharma, when they proceeded to note down for
the benefit of others what the laws were that regulated *Dharma*, they
could not but have drawn upon the Veda. It is true that they arc found
to contain many rules that we cannot trace to the Veda as known to us;
but if they were mere reproductions of whatever is found in the Veda, no
one would care for them. So we are led to the inference that as on most
of the points dealt with by them, their assertions are found to be based
on Vedic texts, the other points also must have had their source in the
Veda; but in those Vedic texts that have become lost to us. We have the
Veda itself testifying to the trustworthy character of at least one
Smṛti-writer, Manu—‘Whatever Manu has said is wholesome.’

*Smrticandrikā*, pp. 1 *et scq*.—The ordinances composed by Manu and
other writers, being based on the Veda, are our sole authority on
Dharma. That the Smṛtis have their source in the Veda is deduced from
the fact that they only expound what is contained in the Veda. Says
Bhṛgu—‘Whatever Dharma has been expounded by Manu has all been set forth
in the Veda.’ *Śaṅkara* also says that ‘the Smṛtis have their source in
the Veda.’ But this refers to only what the Smṛti says regarding
spiritual matters, and not to what they lay down regarding temporal
matters; as is distinctly declared in the Purāṇa—‘All these (smṛtis)
have their source in the Veda—save those portions that deal with visible
(temporal) matters.’

*Question*.—“When the Smṛti itself only expounds whatever is already set
forth in the Veda and is on that account, based upon the Veda, then the
Veda itself being sufficient for all purposes, what is the use of the
Smṛti or *Dharmaśāstra*?”—The Smrticandrikā quotes Marīci as giving the
answer to this question—‘The requisite texts of the Veda are difficult
to understand and are scattered about in various places; all these are
collected and explained by the Smṛtis.’

The Purāṇas are also included under Smṛti, as the Veda itself names
‘Itihāsa-Purāṇa’ along with ‘the four Vedas.’ Viṣṇu also places the
Purāṇas on the same footing as ‘Manu-Smṛti,’ ‘Veda and its subsidiary
sciences,’ ‘Science of Healing.’

This establishes the authority of the authors of the Gṛhyasūtras also;
since all that these do is to lay down practical manuals setting forth
the details of the various rites along with the necessary Mantras
belonging to that individual Vedic recension to which the manual is
inferred to appertain. As says Devala—‘Manu and others are the
expounders of the Law; the authors of the Gṛhyas are the expounders of
the application of Law.’

*Saṃskāra-Mayūkha*, p. 2.—The Smṛti includes the *Āyurveda* Smṛtis also,
as also Purāṇa and the astronomical ‘Saṃhitās,’ compilations of
Varāhamihira and others; as also the Saṃhitā texts which are included in
the Skandapurāṇa.

Now we have got to determine what works are entitled to be classed under
‘*Smṛti*’ or ‘*Dharma-Śāstra*,’ which latter is what is meant by
‘*Smrti*.’

The original Smṛti-writers are thus enumerated by Yājñavalkya (1.4-5):—

1.  Manu,
2.  Viṣṇu,
3.  Yama,
4.  Aṅgiras,
5.  Vaśiṣṭha,
6.  Dakṣa,
7.  Saṃvarta,
8.  Śātātapa,
9.  Parāśara,
10. Āpastamba,
11. Uśanas,
12. Vyāsa,
13. Kātyāyana,
14. Bṛhaspati,
15. Gautama,
16. Śaṅkha-Likhita,
17. Hārīta,
18. Atri,
19. and Yājñavalkya himself.

The following is from Parāśara (Ācāra 12-15), where Vyāsa relates to his
father the Smṛtis he has already learnt:

1.  Manu,
2.  Vaśiṣṭha,
3.  Kaśyapa,
4.  Garga,
5.  Gautama,
6.  Uśanas,
7.  Atri,
8.  Viṣṇu,
9.  Saṃvarta,
10. Dakṣa,
11. Aṅgiras,
12. Śātātapa,
13. Hārīta,
14. Yājñavalkya,
15. Āpastamba,
16. Śaṅkha,
17. Likhita,
18. Kātyāyana,
19. Pracetas.

On Parāśara (1.20), which speaks of ‘propounders of Smṛti,’ Mādhava (p.
98), mentions the following additional names:

1.  Vyāsa,
2.  Yama,
3.  Parāśara,
4.  Bhṛgu,
5.  Nārada,
6.  Baudhāyana,
7.  Pitāmaha,
8.  Sumantu,
9.  Kāśyapa,
10. Babhru,
11. Paiṭhīnasi,
12. Vyāghra,
13. Satyavrata,
14. Bharadvāja,
15. Kārṣṇājini,
16. Jābāli,
17. Jamadagni,
18. Lokākṣi.

The Smṛticandrikā reproduces the same list.

Yājñavalkya and Kātyāyana being omitted, these two lists make the number
36.

The same writer quotes from the Mahābhārata the following:—

1.  Umā-Maheśvara,
2.  andi,
3.  Brahmā,
4.  umāra,
5.  Dhūmrāyaṇa,
6.  Kaṇva,
7.  Vaiśvānara,
8.  Bhṛgu,
9.  Yājñavalkya,
10. Mārkaṇḍeya,
11. Kuśika,
12. Bharadvāja,
13. Bṛhaspati,
14. Kuni,
15. Kuṇibāhu,
16. Viśvāmitra,
17. Sumantu,
18. Jaimini,
19. Śakuni,
20. Pulastya,
21. Pulaha,
22. Pāvaka,
23. Agastya,
24. Mudgala,
25. Śāṇḍilya,
26. Solabhāyana,
27. Bālakhilya,
28. Saptarṣi,
29. Vyāghra,
30. Vyāsa,
31. Vibhāṇḍaka,
32. Vidura,
33. Bhṛgu,
34. Aṅgiras,
35. Vaiśampāyana.

The Smṛticandrikā reproduces Paiṭhīnasi’s list (given by Mādhava), but
adds that the list is not exhaustive, as in addition to them there are
others also, *eg*., Vatsa, Marīci, Devala, Pāraskara, Pulastya, Pulaha,
Kratu, Ṛṣyaśṛṅga, Likhita and Chāgaleva. It quotes *Śaṅkha* as
enumerating

1.  Manu,
2.  Yama,
3.  Dakṣa,
4.  Viṣṇu,
5.  Aṅgiras,
6.  Bṛhaspati,
7.  Uśanas,
8.  Āpastamba,
9.  Gautama,
10. Saṃvarta,
11. Ātreya,
12. Hārīta,
13. Kātyāyana,
14. Śaṅkha,
15. Likhita,
16. Parāśara,
17. Vyāsa,
18. Śātātapa,
19. Pracetas,
20. Yājñavalkya.

Also Aṅgiras quoted mentions the following and calls them *Upa-Smṛti*:

1.  Logākṣi,
2.  Kāśyapa,
3.  Vyāsa,
4.  Sanatkumāra,
5.  Śāntanu,
6.  Janaka,
7.  Vyāghra,
8.  Kātyāyana,
9.  Jātūkarṇa,
10. Kapiñjala,
11. Baudhāyana,
12. Kaṇāda,
13. and Viśvāmitra.

Yājñavalkya’s and Paiṭhīnasi’s lists are reproduced also by the
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 2). To them it adds ‘Viśvāmitra and the rest.’

The Purāṇa has been defined as that which has five characteristic
features in the shape of the accounts of (1) Creation, (2) Dissolution,
(3) Genealogy, (4) Age-Cycles, and (5) History of Dynasties.

The Viṣṇupurāna names the following eighteen Purāṇas and the Bhāgavata
adds the number of verses in each:

1.  Brahma, 10,000,
2.  Padma, 55,000,
3.  Viṣṇu, 23,000,
4.  Śiva, 24,000,
5.  Bhāgavata, 18,000,
6.  Nāradīya, 25,000,
7.  Mārkaṇḍeya, 9,000,
8.  Agni, 15,400,
9.  Bhaviṣya, 14,500,
10. Brahmavaivarta, 18,000,
11. Liṅga, 10,600,
12. Varāha, 24,500,
13. Skanda, 81,000,
14. āmana, 10,000,
15. Kūrma, 17.000,
16. Matsya, 14,000,
17. Garuḍa, 19,000
18. and Brahmāṇḍa, 12,000.

Total number of verses, 4,00,000.

The *Brahmavaivarta* has the *Vāyupurāṇa* in place of the Brahmāṇḍa, and
this diversity is due to the two enumerations referring to two distinct
cycles.

In addition to these eighteen ‘Purāṇas,’ there are 18 ‘Upapurāṇas,’
‘secondary Purāṇas.’ These have been named in the Kūrmapurāṇa:

1.  Sanatkumāra,
2.  Narasiṃha, 18.000,
3.  Nānda (recited by Kumāra),
4.  Śivadharma (recited by Nandīśvara),
5.  Nāradīya,
6.  Durvāsas,
7.  Kāpila,
8.  Mānava,
9.  Uśanas,
10. Brahmāṇḍa,
11. Vāruṇa,
12. Kālikā,
13. Māheśvara,
14. Śāmba,
15. Saura,
16. Parāśara,
17. Mārīca,
18. and Bhārgava.

In place of ‘Nānda,’ the *Brahmavaivarta* has *Vāśiṣṭha-Laiṅga*.

The Saṃskāramayūkha also reproduces the lists of the Viṣṇupurāṇa (for
Purāṇas) and of Kūrmapurāṇa (for Upapurāṇas).

*Vīramitrodaya*, *Paribhāṣā*, pp. 10-24.—The knowledge of ‘Veda’ implies
also the knowledge of certain other branches of study, which is
essential to the proper understanding of the Veda. These have been thus
enumerated by Yājñavalkya—‘There are fourteen departments of knowledge
and of Dharma. The four (1-4) Vedas along with (5) Purāṇas, (6) Nyāya,
(7) Mīmāṃsā, (8) Dharma-Śāstra, (9-14) the six ‘Limbs’ or subsidiary
sciences of the Veda.’

Here ‘Nyāya’ stands for the system propounded by Gautama and others,
dealing with such subjects as the means of knowledge and so forth,
‘Mīmāṃsā’ for the system of interpretation propounded by Jaimini and
that of philosophy propounded by Bādarāyaṇa, ‘Dharmaśāstra’ for the
ordinances of Manu and others, and ‘Limbs of the Veda’ for—(*a*)
Phonetics, (*b*) Rituals, (*c*) Grammar, (*d*) Etymology, (*e*) Prosody
and (*f*) Astronomy.

There is a diversity of opinion regarding the lists of recognised
‘Purāṇas’ and ‘Dharmaśāstras,’ as shown above.

*Smṛticandrikā*, p. 5.—‘Purāṇa’—the Brahma and the
rest;—‘Nyāya’—Reasoning; ‘Mīmāṃsā,’ discussion relating to the exact
meaning of Vedic passages;—‘*Dharmaśāstra*,’ the Smṛtis of Manu and
others; and the four Vedas with the six ‘subsidiary sciences’ are the
‘means’ of *knowing* Dharma; and also of *Dharma* itself, through that
knowledge.



####### (C) Sadācāra

*Medhātithi on Manu*, 2-6.—‘*Sādhūnām āchāraḥ*,’ ‘Practice of good men’
also has to be construed with ‘*Vedavidām*’ ‘learned in the Veda,’ and
the two qualifications ‘Goodness’ and ‘Vedic learning,’ come under
‘culture.’ When in regard to any action, there are no Vedic or Smṛti
declarations available, but cultured people are found to do it as
‘Dharma,’—something *right*—then that action is to be regarded as
‘enjoined in the Veda’ in the same manner as anything laid down in the
Smṛti. What are meant by ‘practices’ here are such customs as the tying
of the bracelet at marriage, the keeping of an exact number of
hair-locks on the head, the exact manner of receiving guests and so
forth. Each of such practices has to be taken on its own merits; it is
not possible to assume Vedic texts corroborating those ither severally
or even collectively; as the rightness or wrongness of a certain
practice varies with circumstances; *e.g*., a certain cultured man may
be very assiduous in attending upon his guests—never leaving them for a
single moment unattended, and so forth. This may he quite agreeable to
one guest who likes constant attendance; but there may be another to
whom all this close attendance is disagreeable; he would prefer much
rather to be left alone to himself. There is no such variation possible
in regard to what is prescribed in the Smṛti; and herein lies the
difference between what is prescribed in the ‘Smṛti’ and what can be
learnt from the ‘Practices of the cultured.’

*Sarvajñanārāyaṇa on Manu*, 2-0.—In cases where we find no guidance
either from Vedic texts or Smṛti or the *Śīla* of learned men, we have
to be guided by the ‘Ācāra,’ Practice, of ‘*Sādhus*,’ persons engaged in
the performance of acts in accordance with the Veda. ‘Ācāra’ really
stands for the recalling and practising of what has been done by the
good men of the past, *i.e*., *Usage* or *Custom*.—This is regarded as
inferior to ‘*Śīla*’ on account of the possibility of suspicion
regarding the correctness of tradition upon which it is based.

*Kullūka on Manu*, 2-6.—‘*Ācāra*’ stands for the *practice* of dressing
oneself in blankets or tree-bark and so forth.

‘*Sādhūnām*’; of the good, *i.e*., righteous persons.

*Rāghavānanda on Manu*, 2-6.—Such practice as binding of the bracelet at
marriage and so forth, which is current among ‘*Sādhus*,’ *i.e*., people
free from ill feeling.

*Nandana on Manu*, 2-6.—Nandana takes ‘Ācāra’ by itself offering no
remarks about it, and construes ‘*Sādhūnām*’ with ‘*Ātmanastuṣṭi*.’

*Viśvarūpa on Yājña*, 1-7.—‘*Sadāchāra*’ stands for those *religious* or
*spiritual* (as distinguished from temporal or worldly) acts that are
done by such men as are free from selfishness and devoid of hypocrisy
and other defects. This is mentioned apart from ‘*Smṛti*,’ (1) because
there is no compilation of the said practices, as there is of the
ordinances; and (2) the trustworthiness of *practices* is doubtful,
which is not the case with *Smṛti*.

*Aparārka on Yājña*, 1-7.—‘*Sadāchāra*’ is the practice of *cultured*
people, *i.e*., such people as are free from ill-will, vanity, possessed
of sufficient funds (*i.e*., not in want of living), not greedy, free
from hypocrisy, haughtiness, avarice, stupidity and anger; those who
have studied the Veda and its supplements in the right manner, and are
expert in making deductions therefrom (Baudhāyana),—the supplements
being the Itihāsas, Purāṇas, and also Grammar and the other subsidiary
sciences; ‘those expert in making deductions therefrom’ are those versed
in the Smṛtis,—the latter being regarded as *indicative* of the Veda.
When the texts speak of ‘*Sadāchāra*’ as an authority what they refer to
is the fact that the customs obtaining in *Brahmāvarta* and other
civilised lands are all based on the Veda (and not that custom *qua*
custom is to be accepted as in itself authoritative): any custom that is
repugnant to any clear text of the Veda is to be rejected. Vaśiṣṭha’s
declaration that ‘all the customs current in *Āryāvarta* are
authoritative’ means that *most* of them are so; as is clear from
another declaration of his to the effect that customs of the cultured
are to be accepted as authority only on points where no Veda or Smṛti
texts are available.

*Mitākṣarā on Yājña*, 1-7.—‘*Sadāchāra*’—practice of the *cultured*, not
of the *uncultured*.

*Vīramitrodaya on Yājña*, 1-7.—‘*Sadāchāra*’ is thus defined in the
*Viṣṇupurāṇa*: “Good men, free from all defects, are called *Sat*, and
their practice, *Ācaraṇa*, is what is called ‘*Sadāchāra*.’” It is the
sole authority in regard to the *Holākā* and such observances.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, pp. 8-29.—Gautama declares that such local,
tribal and family customs as arc repugnant to the scriptures are not
authoritative;—‘Scripture’ here stands for ‘*Veda*, *Smṛti and Purāṇa*.’
This Ācāra stands for positive virtues, as distinguished from ‘*Śīla*’
which stands for the negative ones. If we connect ‘*Sādhūnām*’ with
‘*āchāraḥ*,’ then the meaning comes to be that the practices of even
those not learned in the Veda are to be accepted as authoritative, when
these are men free from all weaknesses and defects; it is in this sense
that in the case of *Śūdraṣ*, the practices of one’s ancestors become an
authoritative source of knowledge of *Dharma*.

*Parāśaramādhava*, p. 100.—‘*Sadāchāra*’—*e.g*., Holākā, Udvṛṣabha and
the like. Those who ‘expound’ or ‘determine’ these are the elders of
each family or tribe.

*Madanapārijāta*, pp. 11-12.—Dharma depends upon ‘Ācāra’—\[But this term
is used here in a very wide sense, being defined as\]—‘Ācāra is the name
of that course of conduct which is enjoined in Śruti and Smṛti and which
is prescribed by the Good.’—This āchāra is to be learnt from persons
born in Madhyadeśa and other countries:—(*a*) the tract of land between
Sarasvatī and Dṛṣadvatī—Brahmāvarta; (*b*) between Himalaya and Vindhya
and between Gaṅgā and Yamunā, West of Prayāga—Madhyadeśa; (*e*) between
Himalaya and Vindhya and the Eastern and Western Oceans—Āryāvarta.

*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda-Saṃskāra*.—“It is difficult to believe that the endless
practices or customs that have grown, and are still growing up from time
to time, should be all based upon Vedic texts. Even Manu’s declaration
cannot be taken as testifying to the authority of each and every custom.
For if their authority rested upon the trustworthy character of the
‘cultured’ persons among whom it is current, then there would be an
interdependence; the people would be ‘cultured’ because they follow
those practices and the practices would be authoritative because they
are followed by those persons. Further, customs and practices are found
to vary in different parts of the country; and certainly all of these
cannot he authoritative.”

It is not each and every practice of the ‘cultured’ that we regard as
authoritative; that alone can be regarded as a trustworthy guide which
is done by the cultured people as ‘Dharma,’ that which they do knowing
it to be ‘righteous.’ And certainly the many misdeeds of well-known
great men that are cited could not have been done by them as ‘*dharma*’;
when the learned regard an act as ‘dharma’ they must do so on the
strength of some Vedic text known to them; hence these Practices and
Customs also must be inferred to have their source in the Veda.

*Smṛticandrikā*, p. 5.—‘Ācāra’ stands for the tying of the bracelet and
such practices.

*Ibid*, p. 6.—The ‘*Śiṣṭaṣ*,’ ‘cultured,’ are defined by Manu (12-109)—

> *dharmeṇādhigato yaistu vedaḥ saparibṛṃhaṇaḥ* \|  
> *te śiṣṭā brāhmaṇā jñeyāḥ śrutipratyakṣahetavaḥ* \|\|

The *paribṛṃhaṇa* of the Veda being the subsidiary sciences, Itihāsa and
Purāṇa. Says Bṛhaspati—

> *itihāsapurāṇābhyāṃ vedaṃ samupabṛṃhayet* \|

\[This occurs in the Mahābhārata also.\]

On questions where we find no Śruti or Smṛti text we are to be guided by
the opinion of the ‘*Pariṣad*,’ ‘Assembly.’ Says Manu (12.108)—

> *amāmnāteṣu dharmeṣu kathaṃ syāditi ced bhavet* \|  
> *yaṃ śiṣṭā brāhmaṇā brūyuḥ sa dharmaḥ syādaśaṅkitaḥ* \|\|

This ‘Assembly’ should consist of at least 10 ‘cultured’ men—as declared
by Gautama—

> *anāmnāte daśāvaraiḥ śiṣṭairūhavadbhiḥ alubdhaiḥ praśastaṃ kāryam* \|

That is, what these people say is ‘good’ should be done. Baudhāyana also
prescribes the same number—

> *daśāvarā pariṣat* \|

Yājñavalkya says—

> *catvāro vedadharmajñāḥ parṣat traividyameva vā* \|  
> *sā brūte yaṃ sa dharmaḥ syādeko vā'dhyātmavittamaḥ* \|\|

by which the Assembly should consist either (1) of four men versed in
the Veda and the Dharmaśāstra, or (2) of those men each versed in three
Vedas, or (3), of only one man who is the best ‘knower of the philosophy
of the Self.’

Manu also (12.110 and 112) fixes the number at (1) *ten* or (2) *three*
of those who are fully learned in the three Vedas.

The opinion of this ‘Assembly’ is as authoritative as the Veda
itself,—says Yama.

Manu (4.178) sanctions the authority of ‘Family Custom’—

> *yenāsya pitaro yātā yena yātāḥ pitāmahāḥ* \|  
> *tena yāyāt satāṃ mārgaṃ tena gacchanna riṣyati* \|\|

But this can be a guide only in matters where the scriptures are found
to he at variance with one another;—as is clear from the words of
Sumantu—

> *yatra śāstragatirbhinnā sarvakarmasu bhārat* \|  
> *tasmin kulakramāyātmācāraṃ tvācared brudhaḥ* \|\|

*Saṃskāramayūkha*, p. 1.—That ‘*Sadāchāra*’ is authoritative which is
not repugnant to *Veda* and *Smṛti* texts.



####### (D) Śīla—Samyak-Saṅkalpaja-Kāma (Mentioned in Manu 2-6.)

*Medhātithi on Manu*, 2.6.—Medhātithi takes the two terms ‘*Śīla*’ and
‘*Smṛti*’ as interrelated,—the two together standing for ‘conscientious
recollection’ (see under ‘Smṛti’), so that according to him ‘*Śīla*’ is
not a distinct means of knowing Dharma. He also suggests another
explanation of ‘*Śīla*’ by which it pertains to all acts; the meaning
being that whatever one does one should do with the mind free from all
‘love and hate.’

*Sarvajñanārāyāṇa on Manu*, 2.6.—In cases where neither Vedic nor Smṛti
tests are available one’s duty can be determined on the basis of the
‘*Śīla*’ of a large number of persons learned in the Veda, *i.e*., their
‘natural inclination,’ ‘temperament.’ In support of the authority of
this we have the Vedic text which declares that ‘whatever the learned
man *feels* is to be regarded *saintly*’;—wherever this is not
available, we have to he guided by the ‘*āchāra*,’ practice, of
‘Sādhus.’

*Kullūka on Manu*, 2.6.—‘*Śīla*’ stands for ‘devotion to Brahman’ and
such other qualities enumerated by Hārīta (*ride* above). According to
Govindarāja however it stands for ‘freedom from love and hate.’

*Rāghavānanda on Manu*, 2.6.—‘*Śīla*’ is conduct, action, of those
learned in the Veda, *i.e*., those who know that the injunctions
contained in the Veda are to he acted up to; or it may stand for the
thirteen qualities spoken of by Hārīta (see above).

*Nandana on Manu*, 2.6.—Nandana defines it as ‘that excellent quality of
the soul which makes a man respected among the wise,’ as defined in the
Mahābhārata; as an example is cited that magnanimity which was shown by
Yudhiṣṭhira when he asked for the life of his stepbrother Nakula before
that of his brother Bhīma and Arjuna, when all of them had been devoured
by the alligator.

*Yājñavalkya*, 1.7.—speaks of *Samyakṣaṅkalpajaḥ kāmaḥ*, determination
or judgment after full reflection.

*Aparārka on Yājña*, 1-7.—This means ‘that desire to act in a certain
way which arises from rightful volition,’ *i.e*., the determination to
attain a certain object by a definite means in accordance with the
Scriptures.

According to *Viśvarūpa* this helps only in determining one out of a
number of optional alternatives.

*Vīramitrodaya on Yājña*, 1-7.—‘Samyakṣaṅkalpa’ is such volition as is
free from love, hatred and such aberrations. ‘*Kāma*’, a well-considered
vow. Or this may be the same as what Manu has called ‘*Śīla*,’ which has
been described in the *Mahābhārata* as consisting in knowledge and
sympathy, in thought, word and act, towards all living beings;—this is
called a ‘source of Dharma’ in the sense that it is helpful in the man
possessed of this quality being better able to understand what is said
in the Veda. Hārīta has described ‘Śīla’ as consisting in the following
ten qualities:—‘Devotion to Brāhmaṇas, Gods and Pitṛs, sympathy, freedom
from jealousy, kindly disposition, friendliness, sweet words, mercy and
calmness.’ This is to be accepted as authoritative only in regard to
those cases of doing (such acts as the helping of a Brāhmaṇa) which are
not covered by the Vedic injunctions bearing on the subject. According
to others, however, it is the authority in regard to such determinations
as ‘I shall not drink water except with food.’

*Another interpretation of the whole verse* .—‘ *Samyak*’ qualifies
‘*Śruti*,’ and means ‘duly understood’; and it also qualifies ‘*Smṛti*,’
where it means ‘based upon the Veda’;—

‘*Svasya*’ is to be taken by itself and construed with ‘*āchāraḥ*’ the
meaning being ‘the practice or custom of *one’s own*
ancestors’:—‘*priyam ātmanaḥ*’ means ‘self-satisfaction’;
‘*Samyakṣaṅkalpajaḥ kāmaḥ*’ means the desire to act in a certain way
after *proper reflection*; this would vary with different individuals;
some men would be satisfied with the mere assertion of a trustworthy
person,while others would want corroborative texts.

*Mitākṣarā on Yājña*, 1.7.—Such desire as is not repugnant to the
scriptures, *e.g*., in such cases as the determination not to drink
water except with food.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, p. 10.—This means a ‘well-considered vow’
such as ‘I shall not drink water except with food’; or it may stand for
the ‘desire to do good and so forth which arises from a proper, *i.e*.,
philanthropic, determination’; in this sense it stands for the same
thing as the ‘*Śīla*’ in Manu’s text.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, pp. 8-25.—The term ‘*Śīla*’ stands for the
thirteen qualities enumerated by *Hārīta*. It stands, it will be seen,
for the negative virtues, and is as such distinguished from ‘Ācāra,’
practice or custom, which stands for the positive ones.

On Yājña. 1.7 the Vīramitrodaya identifies the *Śīla* of Manu with the
‘Samyakṣaṅkalpajakāma’ of Yājñavalkya.

*Smṛticandrikā*, p. 5.—‘*Śīla*’ connotes freedom from love, hatred and
so forth.



####### (E) Ātmanastuṣṭi—Svasya Priyam

*Medhātithi on Manu*, 2.6.—This ‘self-satisfaction’ is meant to be of
those only who are ‘learned in the Veda and good’ (‘*Vedavidām
sādhūnām*’), the idea of this being that the ‘source of Dharma’ is based
upon the trustworthy character of the persons concerned. When the
‘learned and good’ feel satisfied regarding the righteousness of a
certain action, that action must be accepted as right; because such men
can never feel satisfied with anything that is *wrong*. The older
treatises however have explained the meaning to be that in oases of
optional alternatives that alternative should be adopted in regard to
which the man’s own mind feels satisfied. There is yet another
explanation by which what is meant is that ‘whenever one is doing
anything he should keep his mind tranquil and calm’ and in this sense
like ‘*Śīla*,’ ‘freedom from love and hate,’ this ‘self-satisfaction’
also pertains to ‘*all acts*.’

*Sarvajñanārāyaṇa on Manu*, 2.6.—In cases where we have no other means
of ascertaining the right course of action, we are to he guided by
‘self-satisfaction’; *i.e*., we should do that the doing of which makes
us feel easy at heart and satisfies the conscience. This is inferior to
‘*Śīla*’ and ‘*Ācāra*’ as it pertains to the mind of a single individual
and hence is lacking in that corroboration by others which is available
in the case of the other two.

*Kullūka on Manu*, 2.6.—‘Self-satisfaction’ is authoritative only in
regard to the choice of alternatives.

*Nandana on Manu*, 2.6.—Nandana construes this with

‘*Sādhūnām*,’ by which explanation the meaning is that the
self-satisfaction of exceptionally righteous persons is to be regarded
as trustworthy.

*Viśvarūpa on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘Self-satisfaction’ meant here is such as is
not incompatible with Vedic texts, and is not due to restlessness;—the
taking to renunciation, for instance, during a time when the family is
in trouble, would not be ‘lawful,’ even though one may feel
self-satisfaction in it......‘*Svasya ca priyam ātmanaḥ*’ may also mean
‘Liberation.’

*Mitākṣarā on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘Self-satisfaction’ serves to determine which
one of several sanctioned alternatives has to be adopted, *e.g*., the
performance of Upanayan in the 7th or the 8th year.

*Aparārka on Yājña*, 1.7.—It is that which brings satisfaction to one’s
own mind. This is to be accepted as authority only in regard to cases
that are distinctly declared to be subject to such authority, in such
texts as ‘when one feels that there is a load in his mind until a
certain act is done, that act he shall do.’

*Vīramitrodaya on Yājña*, 1.7.—‘*Svasya priyam*’ means
‘self-satisfaction’; *i.e*., the satisfaction regarding the propriety of
a certain act, in the mind of such men as arc steeped in Vedic
tradition. This same idea is expressed by Bhaṭṭa Kumārila in the verse
*etena vaidikāneka* ‘Trustworthiness belongs to the self-satisfaction of
such persons as have their minds steeped in the moral grandeur of the
Veda.’ This ‘self-satisfaction’ must be that of the enquirer himself,
and he cannot go about seeking for that of all Vedic scholars. This is
the sole authority in regard to such questions as to whether or not the
performance of the expiation of a certain sin shall be repeated; this
having been declared by Bṛhaspati:—‘One should go, on doing an act until
his mind becomes *lightened*,’—*i.e*., free from the incubus of the
sinful act committed. Others, however, have held that
‘self-satisfaction’ is what determines which of the several equally
authoritative alternative courses of action one shall adopt.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, pp. 8-25.—‘*Sādhūnām*’ in Manu has to be
construed with ‘*tuṣṭiḥ*’; the sense being that when there is a doubt as
to what is ‘right,’ that course of action is to be accepted as ‘right’
with regard to which there is satisfaction among ‘good men,’ *i.e*., men
whose minds are steeped in Vedic lore. Such is the explanation given by
the *Kalpataru*; this view has the support also of a Taittirīya text,
which says—‘When there are doubts regarding what is *right*, one should
act in the manner that those Brāhmaṇas act who are impartial, judicious,
trustworthy and highly righteous.’ This implies the authority also of
the *Pariṣad*, ‘Council’ or ‘Assembly.’ This ‘self-satisfaction’ is
authoritative only in the determining of one out of a number of optional
alternatives, and there too it is authority only for the man himself;
and the ‘self-satisfaction’ of one man can have no authority for
another.

*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda-Saṃskāra* - *M* *S*.—Mere self-satisfaction is not
authoritative. What is meant is that when a cultured and learned man
feels *satisfied* that a certain course of action is *righteous*, that
satisfaction itself is to be regarded as a trustworthy guide.

*Smṛticandrikā*, p. 5.—This is authority only in determining one of
several optional alternatives.



####### Comparative Authority

*Manu*, 2.10.—‘The Veda is to be known as *Śruti*, R evealed Word, and
the *Dharmaśāstra*, Legal Ordinances, as *Smṛti*; in all matters these
two do not deserve to be criticised.’

According to Medhātithi, ‘Custom’ also is included under ‘*Smṛti*’ here.
Kullūka does not accept this view; according to him the text puts the
*Smṛti* distinctly above *Custom*, which means that *Custom* contrary to
Smṛti is to he rejected.

Manu (2.14) says—‘Whenever there is conflict between two Vedic texts,
both are to be regarded as lawful’; the same with two Smṛti texts, adds
Medhātithi; *i.e*., the two courses of action laid down by the
conflicting texts are to be treated as optional alternatives.

*Viśvarūpa on yājñavalkya*, 1.7.—According to Manu, in all purely
spiritual matters the Veda is the highest authority; the Smṛti-writers
themselves regard the authority of the Smṛti as extremely weak in
comparison with that of the *Śruti*; all which leads to the conclusion
that when *Smṛti* conflicts with *Śruti*, it is to he rejected.

*Aparārka on Yājña*, 1.7.—In the determining of Dharma, says Vyāsa, the
Veda is the only pure source of knowledge, ‘pure,’ *i*. *e*., whose
authority is beyond suspicion;—all the rest are ‘mixed’—*i. e*., their
authority is open to doubt. Hence that is the *highest* Dharma which is
learnt from the Veda; what is declared in the Purāṇa anil other works is
the *lower* Dharma. All other works of human origin are to be rejected
in the matter of Dharma. Vaśiṣṭha says that “Dharma is that which is
prescribed by Śruti and Smṛti; and it is in the absence of these that
the ‘Practice of the Cultured’ is to be accepted as authoritative.”

*Saṃskāramayūkha*, p. 1.—

The order is

1.  Śruti,
2.  Smṛti,
3.  Sadācāra,
4.  Svasya Priyam,
5.  Samyakṣaṅkalpaja-kāma.

Among Smṛtis Manu is most authoritative, as says
Aṅgiras—*manvarthaviparītā tu yā smṛtiḥ sā na śasyate* (*i.e*., not to
be honoured). Also the Veda itself—*yad vai manuravadat tad bheṣajam* \|

*Smṛticandrikā*, pp. 15-17.—Says Manu (2.14)—*tu yatra syāt tatra
dharmāvabhau smṛtau*, *i.e*., where two *Śruti* texts are mutually
contradictory, both are right; *i.e*., the two courses laid down are to
be treated as optional alternatives. The same rule applies to cases of
conflict between two *Smṛti* texts; says Gautama *tustyabalavirodhe
vikalpaḥ*.—When there is conflict between Śruti and Smṛti the latter is
to be rejected; so also when Custom conflicts with Smṛti, the former is
rejected, as is clear from Vaśiṣṭha’s words—*śrutismṛtivihito dharmaḥ
tadabhāve śiṣṭācāraḥ pramāṇam*. The same applies to the opinion of the
Assembly also. When there is conflict between Manu and another *Smṛti*,
the former is to be accepted; as says Aṅgiras:—

> *yat pūrvaṃ manunā proktaṃ dharmaśāstramanuttamam* \|  
> *na hi tat samatikrasya vacanaṃ hitamātmanaḥ* \|\|

Also Bṛhaspati—

> *vedā(du\|rtho)panibaddhatvāt prādhānyaṃ tu manoḥ smṛtaṃ* \|

In cases where the same act is prescribed in equally authoritative texts
in two different forms, we have to accept the more elaborate of the two
and reject the simpler.

*Vīramitrodaya-Paribhāṣā*, pp. 25-29.—When there is a conflict between
two Vedic texts, both are to be regarded as equally authoritative, and
in actual practice the two courses of action are to be treated as
optional alternatives. Similarly when there is a conflict between two
Smṛti texts or between two ‘customs.’ When there is conflict between a
Vedic text and a Smṛti text, preference is to he given to the former as
possessed of inherent authority, while the latter owes its authority to
an assumed Vedic text. When there is a conflict between a Smṛti text and
a Custom, the Smṛti is to he regarded as the more authoritative; *e.g*.,
the custom of the marrying of the maternal uncle’s daughter cannot he
accepted as authoritative when it is found to be in conflict with the
distinct Smṛti text forbidding that practice.

There is a further distinction among authorities of the same class also.
For instance, between two Vedic texts, if one is of doubtful import
while the meaning of the other is clear, then the latter is to be given
preference. If one treats of a more important matter than the other, it
is to be given preference; *e.g*., if one deals with something to be
done, while the other, with a minor detail of the act, the former is to
set aside the latter. What occurs in the opening sentence sets aside
what occurs in the concluding sentence; *e.g*., the opening sentence
speaks of the ‘three Vedas,’ and the concluding sentence speaks of the
‘Ṛk Verse’ as to he recited ‘loudly,’ the signification of the word ‘Ṛk’
in the latter is sublated by that of the word ‘Veda’in the former, and
the ‘loudness’ becomes connected with the *three Vedas*, and not with
the Mantras of the Ṛk Veda only. If what is said in one text is beset
with more difficulties than what occurs in another, then the former is
to be rejected; *e.g*., one text lays down that a man who accepts the
gift of horses should perform as many sacrifices as the horses he
receives; while another speaks of Prajāpati having given a horse to
Varuṇa and performed a sacrifice to this deity—by which the *giver* and
not the *receiver*, is to perform the sacrifice;—now if we accept the
former, *i.e*., if we accept the view that the sacrifice is to be
performed by the *receiver* of the gift, then we shall have the
following difficulties in the construing of the latter text: (1) it will
be necessary to take the Dative in ‘*Varuṇāya*’ (‘*to* Varuṇa’) as
standing for the Ablative (‘*from* Varuṇa’), and (2) to take the verb
‘given’ as standing for ‘accepted’; while on the other hand, if we
accept the latter text, according to which the sacrifice is to be
performed by the giver of the horse, then the only difficulty involved
in the construing of the former text is to take the verb ‘accept’ as
standing for ‘give’; and hence it is the former text that is rejected,
and the conclusion is that the *giver* of a horse is to perform
sacrifices. Where one thing is enjoined in connection with a particular
Veda, this is given preference over what would apply to that same, in
accordance with what has been prescribed in connection with another
Veda; *e.g*., in connection with the Yajurveda we have the injunction
that its Mantras are to be recited *in an undertone*; in accordance with
this rule one may be led to think that the chanting of the *Vāravantīya*
(Sāma-hymn) is to be done in an undertone; but this is precluded by the
‘high pitch’ that has been enjoined in connection with the chanting of
the mantras of the Sāma-Veda. What is enjoined in regard to the
particular ‘Vedic Recensional School’ to which the performer’s family
belongs is given preference over what may have been enjoined in
connection with another school. The general law is superseded by the
particular, and so on.

In the case of Smṛtis also,—the ‘orthodox’ Smṛti sets aside the
‘heterodox,’—among the ‘orthodox’ Smṛtis also, if a certain course of
action is sanctioned by one, hut condemned by another, the latter sets
aside the former, and the action in question is to he avoided. What is
laid down in reference to imperceptible transcendental effects sets
aside what is enjoined for temporal or worldly ends; *e.g*., the law
prohibiting the killing of the Brāhmaṇa sets aside the law that ‘one may
kill a person who is threatening to kill,’ as the latter course of
action is meant only to serve the perceptible purpose of saving one’s
life.. The Smṛti that is based upon a Vedic *Arthavāda* is set aside by
that which is based upon a Vedic injunction; *e.g*., the law sanctioning
the killing of the cow in honour of an honoured guest,—being based upon
an *Arthavāda* passage commendatory of the ‘churning’ or ‘rubbing’ of
sticks,—is set aside by that which prohibits the said killing,—this
latter being based upon the Vedic injunctive passage—‘Kill not Aditi,
the hornless cow.’

Among ‘Custom,’ ‘self-satisfaction’ and ‘well considered vow,’—the
preceding is more authoritative than the following; as declared by the
*Mitākṣarā*.

In some cases what is sanctioned by higher authority is rejected by what
is said by a lower authority; *e.g*., the drinking of wine (at the
*Sautrāmaṇi* sacrifice), even though enjoined by the *Veda*, is not
considered right, in view of its prohibition during *Kali* - *Yuga*
contained in the *Smṛti*.

Any *Smṛti* that goes against the ordinances of Manu is to be
rejected—as declared by *Bṛhaspati* (see above). This is the view of the
*Kalpataru* also.—Customs, local, tribal as well as family, are to be
rejected if repugnant to the Veda or the Smṛti or the Purāṇa.

As between *Śruti* and *Smṛti*, the conclusion arrived at is thus
expressed by Vyāsa:—‘That law which is deduced from the Veda is the
*higher*, while that declared in the Purāṇa and other Smṛtis is the
*lower*; which means that in cases of conflict our first duty is to do
what is laid down in the Veda, and the doing of what is declared in the
Smṛti can be justified only as a substitute, *i.e*., to be adopted only
when there is no possibility of the other being adopted. And this for
the simple reason that according to Manu (11.30), if one follows the
‘second best’ course when the best course is possible, his action
becomes futile; so that tho conclusion indicated by this is that even in
cases of conflict tho *Smṛti* does not entirely lose its authoritative
character; all that happens is that the course of action sanctioned by
it is rendered fruitless by reason of the superiority of authority
attaching to the *Vedic* text to the contrary.

The variability of the Law is unfeignedly declared by Parāśara in 1.22:—

‘The Law or the Right is one in the *Kṛta* Cycle, different in the
*Tretā* Cycle, yet different in the *Dvāpara* Cycle, and yet different
in the *Kali* Cycle,—varying as it does with the character of the
Time-Cycles.’

On this Mādhava makes the following observations:—

The ‘difference’ spoken of here is, not of the *nature* or *essence*, of
the Law or Right, but of its *modes*. If it were the former, then it
would imply a corresponding diversity in the *Veda* also, as the source
of that Law; while as a matter of fact, the Veda does *not* vary with
the time-cycles. As regards the *modes* however, we have several
instances of diversity; for instance, though the act of the *Agnihotra-*
offering itself is the same, yet there is diversity in regard to the
*mode* of performing it according as it is performed in the morning or
in the evening. For instance, at the evening-performance the sprinkling
is to be done with the *mantra ‘Ṛtantva satyena pariṣiñchāmi*,’ while
that at the morning-performance with the *mantra* ‘*Satyantva ṛtena
pariṣiñchāmi*.’ Thus in the present instance also, the variation lies in
the *mode* of doing what is ‘right,’ and not in what *is* ‘right’
itself; the variations being due to the nature of the time-cycle and of
the capacity of the man doing the acts. This matter has been fully
discussed in the Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra VI.3, where the conclusion arrived at is
that in the case of the *Agnihotra* and such other obligatory rites,
only those prescribed details have to be performed which it is within
the capacity of the performer to perform. Baudhāyana also has declared
that the obligatory acts are to be performed to the extent that one can;
they should, on no account, be entirely omitted.

The most important instance of variation is cited by Parāśara (1.23)
himself—“In the *Kṛta* Cycle, *Austerity* is the highest *Dharma* or
Duty;—in the *Tretā, Learning*;—in the *Dvāpara, Sacrifice*,—and in the
*Kali, Charity*.” To the last Bṛhaspati adds ‘sympathy and
self-control.’

There is variation, according to Parāśara (1.24), not only in Law, but
also in the authority:—‘Duringthe *Kṛa*, the Laws are those ordained by
*Manu*,—during the *Tretā*, those ordained by *Gautama*,—during the
*Dvāpara*, those ordained by *Śaṅkha-Likhita*,—and during the *Kali*,
those ordained by *Parāśara*.’ This distinction however has never been
observed in actual practice, as even up to the present time, the work of
Manu holds the highest position among the Smṛtis.



####### Conclusion

From the above we conclude that all the authorities are agreed on the
following points—(*a*) The Veda is the first and paramount authority,
(*b*) The Smṛti is authoritative only in so far as it is not repugnant
to the Veda, to which it owes its authority; but only on matters on
which we have no paramount authority, (*c*) Practices or Customs are
trustworthy guides, only as they are current among the ‘cultured,’ and
then too only those that are not repugnant to Vedic or Smṛti texts.
(*d*) The same with regard to Tribal or Family Customs. (*e*) The
judgment of the ‘Assembly’ of the learned is to be accepted as
authoritative only when it is not repugnant to the Veda, and only when
tho judgment is ‘unbiased’ by improper feelings. There is not a single
text, or ‘explanation,’ which favours the opinion that Custom is to
override original texts,—an opinion that has been upheld by the Privy
Council, and endorsed by eminent writers on Anglo-Hindu Law. Neither
Vijñāneśvara (*Mitākṣarā*) nor Jīmūtavāhana (*Dharmaratna*) nor
Nīlakaṇṭha (*Mayūkha*) countenances any such view; and these three are
regarded by our lawyers as the founders of the principal ‘Schools of
Law.’

This verse proceeds to make it clear how the authority of the *Smṛti*
(Recollection) is due to its connection with persons knowing the Veda.

‘*Whatever Dharma*’—duties relating to castes, duties relating to
life-stages, duties relating to sacramental rites, in their general or
special forms—‘*for whatever person*’—for the Brāhmaṇa or other
castes—‘*has been described by Manu*’—‘*all this is declared in the
Veda*’—*i.e*., is expounded in it; how this is done has been shown in
the preceding verse.

‘*Since the Veda embodies all knowledge*’;—Veda is the cause, the
source, of all that is worth knowing, in regard to superphysical things.
The affix ‘*mayaṭ*’ has been added in the sense that the Veda is *made
up* of all knowledge; applying to ‘knowledge’ the character of being the
*product* of the Veda. When one thing is the produot of another, the
latter is spoken of as ‘embodying’ the former, *i.e*., of the same
nature as the other; and Veda, being the source of knowledge, is said to
‘embody’ it. According to the *Sāṅkhya* theory of the Product being
always existent in the Cause, the Cause is of the same nature as the
Product.

Or, the meaning may be that ‘the Veda proceeds from all knowledge’ as
its source; the ‘*mayaṭ*’ affix in this sense being used according to
Pāṇini’s *Sūtra* 4.3.81.—(7)

‘*All this*’—all tilings that can be known, those that are created as
well as those that are uncreated (eternal); all that is dealt with in
the scriptures, what is amenable to perception and other ordinary means
of knowledge, and also what is not so amenable.

‘*Having perceived with* *the* *of knowledge*’—in the shape of the
learning of and pondering over the various sciences of Reasoning,
Grammar, Philology, Mīmāmsā and the rest. The study of the scriptures is
called the ‘eye’ in the sense that it is *like* the eye, in being the
instrument of knowledge; the similitude being that ‘Dharma is known by
means of scriptures in the same way as Colour is known by means of the
Eye.’

‘*Honing perceived*’—*i.e*., after having ascertained by means of due
consideration.

‘*Resting upon the authority* *of* *the Revealed Word*.’—*i.e*., in
accordance with the authority of the Veda.

‘*Should enter upon his duties*’—*i.e*., perform his *dharma*.

After all the sciences have been studied, the trustworthy character
becomes fully established, which is not done until the sciences have
been duly studied. When a man carefully ponders over the sciences, he
comes to the conclusion that there are no grounds for believing in the
authority of these sciences, while there are reasons for trusting the
authority of the Veda.

‘*Sarvam*,’ ‘*all*,’ qualifies all that is to be known; and
‘*nikhilam*,’ ‘*fully*,’ is an adverb modifying the participle
‘*samavekṣya*,’ ‘*having perceived*,’—‘*Having fully
perceived*,’—*i.e*., (1) having stated, in the form of the *primâ*
*facie* Argument, all possible semi-arguments in support of the view
that the other sciences are authoritative,—or that the Veda is not
authoritative,—(2) having refuted those arguments by means of perfectly
valid reasonings based upon the established theory,—when one states his
own finally considered view, the final conclusion arrived at is that
*the Veda is authoritative*;—all this is what is implied by the term
‘fully.’ Thus though the term ‘*sarva*’ and ‘*nikhila*’ are synonyms,
yet since they serve two distinct purposes, they are not regarded as
being a needless repetition.

The term ‘*sva*,’ ‘*own*’ is purely explanatory; what is the ‘duty’ of
one man is not the ‘duty’ of another.—(8)

There might be some one who, being an unbeliever, might form the
misconception that the acts laid down in the Veda are fruitless, and
omit to do them; hence with a view to induce such a man to undertake the
performance of those acts, the Author, placing himself in the position
of a friend, proceeds to indicate the. perceptible results that follow
from the acts in question, to say nothing of other kinds of results.

The man who performs the act, known as ‘duty,’ ‘Dharma,’—which is ‘*laid
down by the Revealed Word and the Recollections*—obtains ‘*here*,’ in
this wold, as long as he lives, ‘*fame*,’ praise, honour, regard; that
is, all men respect him and love him as one ‘who is firm in the rightful
path and highly virtuous.’

‘*After death*,’—in another body—he obtains that ‘happiness’ superior to
which there is no other happiness. As a matter of fact, almost all the
acts are prescribed in the Veda as to be done by one who desires Heaven;
and ‘Heaven’ stands for ‘unsurpassed happiness’; hence it is that the
author speaks of ‘unsurpassed happiness.’

For these reasons, it is only right that the unbeliever also, who seeks
for nothing but visible results, should undertake the performance of the
acts in question. This is the purport of the text.—(9)

The Veda should be known as the ‘revealed word,’ and the Dharmaśāstra as the ‘recollections’; in all matters, these two do not deserve to be criticised, as it is out op these that Dharma shone forth.—(10)


“Scripture is not authoritative; why then should contrariness to it be regarded as undesirable? That the scripture (Veda) is unauthoritative is proved by such discrepancies as (a) untruthfulness, (b) inconsistency and (c) repetition. 


(a) Such sacrifices as the Kārīrī (which is laid down as to be performed for obtaining rain) are performed by men desiring min, but as a matter of fact no rain comes after the performance. As regards the rain that might come at some future time, it has been well said—‘The Kārīrī having been performed during the autumn, when the cornfields were drying up, if the rain falls during the spring, this only leads to cattle-disease!’ Further, as regards the Jyotiṣṭoma and such other sacrifices, which are spoken of as bringing their rewards at some future time, since the acts will have completely disappeared after performance, the assertion that their reward would come after a hundred years would be exactly like the confident assertion of the Vampirist. From this it is clear that the Veda is untruthful, 


(b) There is ‘inconsistency’ also: when it is said ‘libations should be offered after sunrise,’ if it were offered before sunrise, it would be clearly wrong; as it is said—‘those who perform the Agnihotra before sunrise utter falsehood morning after morning.’ Then again, it is said ‘that the libations should be offered before the sun has risen,’ for (it is said) ‘the offering made after sunrise would be like the offering of reception to the guest after he had gone.’ Now in the former we have the injunction of offering after sunrise, and a deprecation of offering before sunrise, while in the latter we have the reverse. So that people are always in doubt as to which alternative they should adopt. 


(c) The same Agnihotra that is enjoined in one Vedic Rescension is found to be enjoined in another Rescension also; and it has been held (by the Mīmāmsakas) that the act, mentioned in the various texts, is one and the same (Agnihotra) And this is a clear Repetition.”

*Objection*:—“Is this a treatise on the meanings of words, a
lexicon,—like the works beginning with such words as *Ātmabhūḥ*,
*Parameṣṭhī* (are the names of Brahmā), and so forth,—that it is stated
that ‘Revealed Word’ means the *Veda*, and ‘Recollections’ means the
*Dharmaśāstra*?”

*Answer*:—In ordinary life, the ‘Practices of Cultured Men’ are not
regarded either as ‘Revealed Word’ or as ‘Recollection,’ on the ground
of their being not codified; codified treatises alone are known as
‘*Smṛtis*,’ ‘Recollections’; and it is for the purpose of declaring that
these Practices also are included under ‘*Smṛti*’ that the author has
set forth this verse.

‘*Dharmaśāstra*,’ ‘Dharma-ordinance,’ is that which serves the purpose
of ‘ordaining’ (teaching) Dharma as to be done; and ‘*Smṛti*’ is that
wherein *Dharma* is taught, *i.e*., laid down as to be done; and
codification or non-codification is entirely immaterial. Now as a matter
of fact a knowledge of what should be done is derived from the Practices
of Cultured Men also; so that these also come under ‘*Smṛti*.’ Hence
whenever mention is made of ‘*Smṛti*’ in connection with any matter, the
Practices of Cultured Men should also be taken as included under the
name.

“If all *Dharmaśāstra* (‘ordinance of Dharma’) is ‘*Smṛti*’ then the
Veda also, which is the ‘ordinance of Dharma’ *par excellence*, would
have to be regarded as *Smṛti*,”—with a view to preclude the possibility
of such an idea being entertained, the author has said—‘*The Veda should
be known as the Revealed Word*.’ Where the words conveying the ‘Teaching
of Dharma’ are directly perceived (heard), it is the ‘Revealed Word’;
while where the words of Teaching are only *recollected*, it is
‘*Smṛti*’; and since this latter condition is also fulfilled by the
‘Practices of Cultured Men,’ this latter also comes under ‘*Smṛti*’; as
a matter of fact, no authority can attach to any Practice, in
corroboration whereof a Vedic text is not ‘recollected.’

Or, the mention of the ‘Revealed Word’ may be explained as serving the
purpose of showing that the *Smṛti* is equal to the *Veda*.

*Question*:—“What is that common function of Revealed Word and
Recollection which rhe present verse seeks to attribute to the Practices
of Cultured Men?”

*Answer*:—‘*In all matters these two should not be criticised*’;—‘*These
two*’—*i.e*., Revealed Word and Recollection.—‘*In all matters*’—*i.e*.,
even in regard to apparently inconceivable things, such as are entirely
beyond the scope of those means of knowledge that are applicable to
perceptible things; *e.g*., (*a*) the same act of killing leads, in one
case, to good, and while in another case it leads to sin; (*b*) the
drinking of wine leads to Hell, while the drinking of Soma removes sin.
In such matters, we should not proceed to discuss the various *pros and
cons*. ‘*Criticism*’ consists in raising doubts and conceiving of
contrary views. For example—“If the act of *killing* is sinful, then
since the act of *killing* is the same in all cases, that done in the
course of Vedic sacrifices should also be sinful;—if the latter killing
is a source of good, ordinary *killing* also should be conducive to
good; the act being exactly the same in both cases.”

What is prohibited here is that ‘criticism,’ in which we conceive of the
form of an act to be quite the reverse of what is declared in the Veda,
and proceeding to examine it by means of reasonings based upon false
premisses, begin to insist on the conclusion thus arrived at. It is not
meant to prohibit such enquiry and discussion as to whether the *Prima*
*Facie View* or the *Established Thesis* is in due accord with the Veda.
That such an inquiry is not meant to be prohibited is clear from what
the author says later on—‘He alone, and none else, knows Dharma, who
examines it by reasonings.’ (Manu, 12.106)

*Question*:—“Is this *criticism* prohibited with a view to some
invisible (superphysical) results?”

We say—*no. Because it was out of these two that Dharma shone forth*.
\[This is what is intended by the said prohibition.\]

This assertion points out the fact that all the arguments, set forth by
casuists in support of things contrary to what is laid down in the Veda,
are fallacious. These arguments are of the following kind—“The killing
of animals in the course of Vedic sacrifices must be sinful, because it
is *killing*, like any ordinary killing.”—Now that *killing* is sinful
is learnt from no other source of knowledge except scriptures; under the
circumstances, no reason can be found to establish the sinfulness of
*killing* until the scriptures have been accepted as authoritative; and
when once the authority of the Veda has been admitted, it could not be
reasonable to bring forward arguments against it, as this would
invalidate the (acknowledged) authority of scriptures; and this would
involve self-contradiction: at first the scriptures were admitted to be
authoritative, and then subsequently they are held to be
un-authoritative; and this opinion would be contrary to the person’s own
previous assertion,—no casuist ever says ‘my mother is childless’; and
it is also contrary to the scriptures.

The Casuist might argue as follows:—

> “Scripture is not authoritative; why then should contrariness to it be
> regarded as undesirable? That the scripture (Veda) is unauthoritative
> is proved by such discrepancies as (*a*) untruthfulness, (*b*)
> inconsistency and (*c*) repetition.
>
> (*a*) Such sacrifices as the *Kārīrī* (which is laid down as to be
> performed for obtaining rain) are performed by men desiring min, but
> as a matter of fact no rain comes after the performance. As regards
> the rain that might come at some future time, it has been well

That there is no ‘untruthfulness’ in the Veda is what is meant by the
last quarter of the Verse (‘it was out of these that Dharma shone
forth’). Because out of the Veda ‘*Dharma alone*—*i.e*., only that a
certain act *should be done*, in the form of sacrifice,—‘*shone forth*,’
is expounded; and it does not say anything definite in regard to the
time at which the rewards shall appear; this is clear from the fact that
the passages that speak of rewards do not make mention of any time; all
that we learn from the Injunction is that a certain result shall follow,
and the Injunction does not specify the time. As a matter of fact,
divisions of time, past, present and future, are related to what is
expressed by the verbal root; while the *Result* is not denoted by the
verbal root at all; it is only implied by the Injunction; what is
denoted by the verbal root (*i.e*., the act of ‘sacrifice’) is actually
accomplished at the time (of the performance), in the form of the
offering of a substance for the benefit of a certain deity,—the
fulfilment of this offering appearing in the form of the transformation
of the substance offered (into the fire, for instance). Further in
ordinary life also, we find that when a person, who is an obedient
servant of another, is directed to go to a certain place, he at once
obeys the order; though as regards his wages, in some cases he may
obtain it at the very beginning; but also sometimes during the act, or
even after the act has been accomplished; and then also he may get them
on the same day, or the next day, or at some future time. In the same
manner, there is no limit as to the time at which the results spoken of
in the scriptures will appear; all that is meant is that (by the
performance of the act) the result, in the shape of Heaven, Rain or so
forth, is brought within reach,—and not (hat they appear on the very
same day. Then again, just as there are obstacles in the way of the
realising of results of acts done in the ordinary course of life, so
there are also in the case of the acts prescribed by the Veda,—such
obstacles consisting of past sins and so forth. This (possibility of the
Rain not coming immediately after the act) is clearly shown in the Veda
itself when it says ‘if the rain should not come, the man should
continue as before.’ And as regards the *Sarvasvāra* sacrifice (which is
laid down as leading the performer to heaven), people have explained
that the reward does not consist in the *immediate entrance to Heaven*,
in fact it consists in what the man actually desires, and the desire is
in the form ‘may I reach heaven without difficulty \[ *i.e*., after
death; immediate translation to heaven would mean immediate death, which
no man desires\].

As regards the argument that there is no difference in the act of
*killing* as done in ordinary life and as done during a Vedic
sacrifice,—what has to be borne in mind is the fact that the sinfulness
of the act of killing is known only from the scriptures, it is not
amenable to perception or any ordinary means of knowledge; and there is
certainly a difference: the ordinary *killing* is prompted by passion,
while the sacrificial *killing* is prompted by Vedic Injunction; and as
the killing of the animal offered to Agni-Soma is prompted by the Vedic
Injunction, this constitutes a great difference. From all this it is
clear that in the Veda there is nothing ‘untruthful.’

As regards ‘Inconsistency’ (which is the second point urged against the
Veda), the Author is going to answer it in the text itself (Verses 14-15
below).—(10)

For an interesting discussion regarding the *anṛtavyādhātapunaruktadoṣa*
attaching to the Veda, the reader is referred to Vātsyāyana’s Bhāṣya on

an Iṣṭi sacrifice which is described as leading the sacrificer directly
to heaven; and in regard to this there is a difference of opinion among
Vedic scholars: some hold that entrance into heaven is not the actual
result, the result being the accomplishment of what the man
desires—*viz*., the fulfilment of his wish *to go to heaven without any
hindrance, whenever he may die*.

This has been quoted by the *Mitākṣarā* under 1.7, in support of the
view that the name ‘*Smṛti*’ is applied to the *Dharmaśāstra*.

On the ground of ‘untruthfulness’ and ‘unreliability’ *if a twice-born
person, relying upon the science of dialectics* the ‘science of
dialectics’ here stands for the polemical works written by Atheists,
treatises of *Bauddhas* and *Charvākas*, in which it is repeatedly
proclaimed that “the Veda is conducive to sin”;—relying upon such a
science, if one should scorn the Veda; *i.e*., when advised by some one
to desist from a certain course of action which is sinful according to
the Veda and the Smṛti, in the words—‘Do not do this, it is prohibited
by the Veda,’—if he disregards this advice and persists in doing it,
saying, ‘what if it is prohibited in the Veda or in the Smṛtis? They are
not at all authoritative’;—even without saying this, if he should even
think in this manner,—and if he is found to pay much attention to the
science of dialectics;—such a person *should he cast out by the
good*—despised by all cultured persons—out of such acts as ‘officiating
at sacrifices,’ ‘teaching,’ ‘honours of a guest’ and so forth. Since the
text does not specify the acts (from which the man should be kept out),
it follows that he should be kept out of all those acts that are fit for
the learned. And the reason for this lies in the fact that it is only
the ignorant man, whose mind is uncultured and who smacks of the
polemic, that can speak as above (in deprecation of the Veda); and to
the said acts (of officiating, etc.) it is only the learned man that can
be entitled. It is in view of this that such ‘criticism’ has been
prohibited in the preceding verse,—such criticism being due to want or
respect,—and it does not deprecate such inquiry as might be instituted
for the purpose of elucidating the true meaning of the Veda.

It is in view of all this that the author states the reason for what he
has asserted—‘*The* *detractor of the Veda* *being an infidel*.’ Thus
the man, who would set forth arguments in support of the view that ‘the
Veda is unauthoritative,’ only by way of a *primâ* *facie* statement,
would not he an ‘infidel’; because such statement of the arguments would
he made only for the purpose of strengthening the final conclusion (that
the Veda is authoritative).

The text speaking of tin; ‘*detractor of the Veda*,’ has not mentioned
the *Smṛti*; hut the idea is that both stand on the same footing, and
both equally form the subject-matter of the context; hence the mention
of any one of them implies both.

Some people might however take the term ‘Veda’ (in the expression
‘detractor of the Veda’) to be actually restricted to the *Veda only*,
and they would thence conclude that ‘the detractor of *Smṛtis*’ should
not be cast out, the casting out in this verse being declared for the
‘detractor of the Veda’ only. With a view to such people the Author adds
the following verse.—(11)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

*Hetuśāstrāśrayāt*’.—‘Relying upon the argumentative science of the
Bauddhas, Cārvākas &c.’ (Medhātithi);—‘Relying on methods of reasoning
directed against the Veda’ (Kullūka and Nārāyaṇa).

The argumentative person is always decried: see *e*. *g*. 4.30, where
the ‘*Hetuka*’ is described as not fit to be honoured; the ‘*Hetuka*’ is
mentionod in 12. 111. as a person who must be a member of the *Pariṣad*;
though in the latter text the term has been explained as ‘one
well-versed in the principles of Mīmāṃsā and the Śāstras’ (see
*Mitākṣarā* on 3. 301, p. 1384).

‘*Nāstiko vedanindakaḥ*’—see *Parāśaramādhava* (Prāyaścitta, p. 424)
where we read—‘The detracting of the Veda is of three kinds—(1) The
first is that which consists in seeking to prove the untrustworthy
character of the Veda by means of arguments culled from *Bauddha*,
*Jaina* and other treatises;—this has been described by Yājñavalkya as
being equal in heinousness to the murdering of a Brāhmaṇa. (2) The
second consists in neglecting the acts laid down in the Veda and Śrutis,
through one’s tendency to wranglings and disputations;—it is this that
is referred to by Manu under 2.11, who further regards it as equal in
heinousness to the drinking of wine. (3) The third consists in lack of
due faith,—the acts laid down being done only through fear of popular
odium, and not through any faith in them; tins has been mentioned among
*Minor Sins*.

This verse has been quoted in the *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 4) which
reads ‘*ubhe*’ for ‘*mūle*’ and explains it as ‘*Śruti* and *Smṛti*’;
for ‘*śrayāt*’ it reads ‘*shraya*’.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

There is no difference here. The prohibition of detracting the Veda
implies that there should be casting out of also one who detracts the
*Smṛti*, the *Practic Men* and *Self-satisfaction*. These also describe
only such *Dharma* as is based upon the Veda; hence the detractor of
these is also the ‘detractor of the Veda.’

*Objection*:—“There is no need for having both the verses; a single
verse would have been sufficient, somewhat to the following effect:—‘the
twice-born person, who, relying upon the Science of Dialectics, should
scorn the sources of Dharma, beginning with *Veda* and ending with
*Self-satisfaction*, should be cast out by all good men, on account of
his being an infidel.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—Teachers do not mind the
burdening (prolexity) of their works; what they make every effort to
avoid is the burdening of the intellect (of the learner); as it is the
latter which interferes with the right understanding of *Dharma*; and
this misunderstanding obstructs the fulfilment of the ends of man.

Then again, even if the author had mentioned all the four sources of
Dharma (as suggested by the objector), some people might still argue
thus—“the author should have mentioned the Veda only, all *Dharma* being
based upon the Veda.” Hence it is for the purpose of clearness that the
author has stated the matter in both ways: the former verse being
intended for those who like brevity, and both the verses for other
persons.

‘*What is agreeable to oneself*’ is the same as the ‘self-satisfaction’
spoken of before. The term ‘*oneself*’ is added only for filling up the
metre.

‘*These constitute directly the means of knowing Dharma*’—‘*Lakṣaṇa*’
means *cause*, *indicator*; and *Sense-Perception* is not the means of
knowing *Dharma*, as some people have held, speaking of (the sages as)
‘persons who have directly *perceived* Dharma.’

In the compound ‘*Chaturvidham*,’ ‘*fourfold*,’ the term ‘*vidhā*’ means
*kind, form*. As a matter of fact, Veda is the only source of knowledge
of Dharma, and *Smṛti* and the rest are only so many *forms* of the
Veda.

Other people have explained this second verse as serving the purpose of
recapitulating (all that has been said regarding the sources of Dharma).
The description of the means of knowing Dharma having been finished, it
is the end of this section that is indicated by the repetition
(contained in the present verse). Such is the fashion with treatises on
the Vedāṅgas; *e.g., ‘saṃsthājapenopatiṣṭhante upatiṣṭhante*’ (when;
‘*upatiṣṭhante*’ is repeated for indicating the end of the section); and
when the author sets forth the second verse he has in his mind the
sum-total of all that has been said in the present section. It is just
as the Naiyāyikas, having propounded the Proposition that ‘Word is
non-eternal,’ set forth the reasons in support of it, and then
re-iterate the conclusion, saying ‘therefore word is non-eternal.’ In
fact such is the way of all writers; *e.g*., the author of the
*Mahābhāṣya* (Patāñjali) also sometimes states the Sūtra or the Vārtika,
and having explained it, repeats it again.—(12)

“When the act is endowed with a certain faculty, it does not lose that faculty, even though it may be performed with some other end in view; it must always bring about its natural effects; e.g., even though one may drink poison, with the idea that it is an efficacious medicine, yet it does not fail to kill him. Similarly even though the act may be done with a view to some visible reward, yet it cannot fail to bring about the invisible results mentioned in ' the scriptures. Why then should you have this aversion, which makes you assert that an act should not be undertaken with a view to worldly advancement?”

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

‘*Wealth*’ stands for cattle, land, gold and so forth, and ‘*addiction*’
to it means being entirely taken up with the undertaking of cultivation,
service, etc., for the purpose of acquiring and accumulating wealth.

‘*Pleasures*’ stands for *sexual pleasures*; and ‘addiction’ to these
means constant recourse to it, as also to its accompaniments in the
shape of singing and music, etc.

For people who are devoid of these (wealth and pleasures), ‘*the
knowledge of Dharma*,’ the true understanding of *Dharma*, ‘*is
ordained*,’ specially propounded, accomplished; the verb ‘*vidhīyate*’
is derived from the root ‘*dhīṅ*’ to *accomplish*.

*Objection*.—How is it that people addicted to wealth and pleasures can
have no knowledge of ‘*Dharma*?’ In fact such persons also, as time
permits them, can obtain some knowledge of ‘*Dharma*,’—by listening at
the time of eating and at such times as do not interfere with their
pursuit of wealth and pleasure, to stories and to the precept or example
of others (who know *Dharma*).”

In view of the above objection, the author has added the words—‘*for
those who seek the knowledge of Dharma,’ etc*. The chief authority for
*Dharma* is the Veda; and the Veda can never be understood by the
persons referred to. It is extremely difficult to comprehend and for its
due comprehension it requires the thorough study of the sciences of
*Nigama* (Vedic commentaries), *Nirukla* (Philology), *Vyākaraṇa*
(Grammar), *Tarka* (Logic) *Purāṇa* (History) and *Mīnāmsā* (Exigetics).
And this entire mass of literature can never be acquired by a man unless
he renounces all other activities. What can be learnt from stories and
examples are only a few stray *Dharmas*, and not the entire body of
Dharma, in the shape of the performance of the *Jyotiṣṭoma* and other
sacrifices, along with all its accessory details, which can be learnt
only from the Veda and the other sources of Dharma. It is in view of all
this that the text says—‘*the Revealed Word is the highest authority*.’
This how ever is not meant to take away the force of ‘Example’ as a
source of knowledge.

What is stated in the text is corroborated by the following well-known
saying—‘He alone acquires learning who shuns wealth like snake,
sweetmeats like poison, and women like evil spirits?



\[ *Another explanation of the verse*.\]

According to others again the expression ‘*arthakāma*’ stands for
*hankering after visible rewards*—and for people ‘addicted’ to
these,—those who hanker after honour, fame, etc., and who, seeking after
visible results, have no other end in life save worldly advancement—‘the
knowledge of Dharma,’ *i.e*., ‘performance of Dharma,’—is not
‘ordained,’ taught. The term ‘*jñāna*’ (’knowledge’) stands for’that in
which the act becomes recognised’ (*jñāyate asmin*), *i.e*., its
performance; it is only when the *Dharma* is performed that it becomes
clearly manifest, clearer indeed than that comprehended at the time that
the scriptures are studied. It is for this reason that it is the
*performance* that is spoken of as ‘*jñāna*,’ ‘knowledge.’

What the text means therefore is this:—Even though the performance of
Dharma brings worldly advancement, yet one should not undertake it
entirely with a view to that fame; it should be undertaken with the sole
idea that it is prescribed by the scriptures. The act having been done
with this idea, if some visible result also follows, it may do so, but
it is not what is thought of by the man. In fact the

Veda itself describes the result following from Vedic study as ‘fame and
worldly advancement,’ in the passage—‘the world progressing endows him
with four things—honour, gifts, freedom from taxes and freedom from
death.’ To the same effect is the following saying—‘The water supplied
for the growth of sugar-cane waters also the grasses and creepers, in
the same manner when a man treads the path of *Dharma*, he also obtains
fame, pleasure and riches.’

*Objection*.—

> “When the act is endowed with a certain faculty, it does not lose that
> faculty, even though it may be performed with some other end in view;
> it must always bring about its natural effects; *e.g*., even though
> one may drink poison, with the idea that it is an efficacious
> medicine, yet it does not fail to kill him. Similarly even though the
> act may be done with a view to some visible reward, yet it cannot fail
> to bring about the invisible results mentioned in ' the scriptures.
> Why then should you have this aversion, which makes you assert that an
> act should not be undertaken with a view to worldly advancement?”

It is in view of this objection that the text adds—‘*For those seeking
for the knowledge of Dharma, the Revealed Word is the highest
authority*.’ And what this means is that ‘those who seek for visible
rewards do not obtain any invisible reward,—and it is not only that he
does not obtain the invisible result, he commits sin also by being
addicted to what is prohibited.’—(13)

The objection urged above (in the *Bhāṣya* on Verse 10) is answered
here.

When ‘*between two Vedic texts* there is ‘*conflict*,’—*i.e*., setting
forth of contrary facts,—*e.g*., what is declared to be ‘Dharma’ by one
text is pronounced to bo ‘*adharma*’ by another;—in such cases both are
Dharma,—*i.e*., to be performed as optional alternatives. The
authoritative strength of the two texts is equal; hence it cannot bo
discerned which is reliable and which is not. Thus the conflict being
between two equally authoritative texts bearing upon the same subject,
there must be option.

*Objection*.—

> “The text speaks of *both* being *Dharma*, which means that there
> should be *combination* (and not *option*); as it is only when there
> is *combination* that *both* could be *Dharma*; otherwise (), only
> *one* of them could be *Dharma*. (at a time).”

We deny this. The use of the word ‘both’ is incompatible with separate,
performance (even acts performed one after the other, and not
conjointly, can be spoken of as ‘both’); the word does not necessarily
denote *two things taken together*.

Further, *option* is distinctly the reasonable course to adopt. The
action known as ‘*Agnihotra*’ is one only; and with reference to this
single act, three points of time have been laid down; now the *action*
forms the primary factor, the comes in only as a subordinate element;
nor is it possible to adopt all the three points of time in connection
with any single performance; nor again can it be right to repeat the
performance for the sake of the *time*; as it is never right to repeat
the primary for the sake of the secondary factor. From all this it
follows that *option* is most reasonable, as declared in the words
‘whenever there is conflict between authorities of equal force, there is
option.’ (*Gautama*, 1.3.)

‘*Both have bent proclaimed to be Dharma*.’—“What is the difference
between this statement and the former one, ‘both are Dharma’?”

There is no difference; in the former statement, the author has stated
his own opinion, and in the latter he supports his opinion by the
opinion of other teachers, by pointing out that ‘this is what has also
been proclaimed by other wise men.’—(14)

are two Vedic texts setting forth two conflicting views, both are to be

Manu himself, *i. e*. the two are to be regarded as optional
alternatives.

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This is an instance of the ‘conflict’ spoken of in the preceding verse.

In regard to the offering of the Agnihotra-lilbtions, all these three
points of time have been prescribed,—and the injunction of each of these
deprecates the others; and the sense of these Vedic texts is that ‘*the
merificial act may be performed at any time*’;—in all ways the offering
proceeds, *i.e*., it should proceed. As regards the deprecation of the
offering done *after sunrise* (which is found in the text enjoining the
time before sunrise), this deprecation is not meant to be an interdict;
it is only meant to be an injunction of the offering *before sunrise*.
Similarly in the other cases. Thus what is meant is that the act may be
performed at any one of the three points of time; and the command of the
scriptures becomes fulfilled by the offering being done at any one time.

‘*Such is the pronouncement of the Veda*.’—This is what is meant by the
Vedic declaration; and it does not mean that what is deprecated is
interdicted.

The ‘*sacrificial act*’ spoken of here is what is known as the
‘*Agnihotra-homa*’; there is not much difference between ‘*yāga*’(a
sacrifice) and ‘*homa*’ (libation-pouring). When one renounces his
proprietary right over a substance in favour of a certain deity,—the
idea in his mind being ‘this belongs to the deity now, and not to
me,’—this is what constitutes ‘*yāga*’ ‘sacrifice’; and exactly the same
is the form of ‘Homa,’ ‘Pouring of libation,’ also. The only difference
is that in *Homa* there is the additional factor of the substance being
*thrown*, deposited in a specified manner, in fire or some such
receptacle. It is in view of this similarity that the *Homa* is spoken
of here as ‘*yajña*.’ That this is so is proved by the fact that the
three points of time spoken of have been prescribed in the Veda in
connection with *Homa*, and not all kinds of sacrifice.

The expressions ‘*udite*’ (‘after sunrise’) and the rest are to be taken
as parts of, and as standing for, such declarations as ‘*udite
hotavyam*’ (‘the Homa should be performed after sunrise’) and so
forth;—the construction being that ‘the meaning of the declaration that
the Homa should be performed after sunrise, not before it, etc., etc.,
is as follows.’

By the compound word ‘*samayā*’ the time of early dawn is meant. Others
have taken it as consisting of two words: ‘*samayā*’ meaning *near*,
requires its correlative in the shape of *something that is near*; and
since the two points of time mentioned in the sentence are those
‘before’ and ‘after sunrise,’ the required correlative in the present
instance is the time of *twilight*. ‘*Adhyuṣita*’ stands for *the time
of departure of the night*, and means ‘at the departure of night.’ \[So
the compound means ‘that twilight which comes after the departure of
night.’\]

The words of the text are intended to quote the words of the Veda, which
are found to be read in one form in one text, and in another form in
another text; so that whether the expression ‘*samayādhyuṣita*’ is one
word or two words can be ascertained only from the original texts.

Thus then, the same act of Homa being laid down in the Veda as to be
done *optionally* at any one of the three points of time, there is no
*inconsistency*. It is only in connection with two accomplished entities
that, when found to be incompatible with one another, they are held to
be ‘inconsistent’; the same cannot be true in connection with things
still to he accomplished \[and all actions belong to this latter
category\]. For what has got to be accomplished may be accomplished
either in one way or another; and how could there be any inconsistency
in this?

In the case of conflicting *Smṛti* -texts also, the most reasonable view
to take is that they lay down optional alternatives.—(15)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Samayādhyuṣite*’;—The dawn (Medhātithi),—or that twilight which comes
after the departure of the night (Ibid, and Govindarāja);—the time when
neither the sun nor the stars are visible (Kullūka).

This verse has been quoted by the *Madanapārijāta* (p. 175) as
indicating the two divisions of the time ‘before sunrise’;—these two
divisions being ‘*Anudita*’ and ‘*Samayādhyuṣita*.’ These two are more
fully described by Kātyāyana, who defines the ‘*anudita*’ as ‘the
sixteenth part of the night, adorned by stars and planets’,—and the
‘*Samayādhyuṣita*’ as that time in the morning when the stars have
disappeared, but the sun has not risen.

The same authority defines the ‘*udita* ‘sunrise,’ as that when the mere
streak of the sun is visible, not all its rays.

It is quoted also in the the *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Ācāra, p. 326);—in the
*Saṃskāraratnamālā*, (p. 2) as laying down the two times for *Homa*, and
it reads ‘*homaḥ*’ for ‘*yajñaḥ*’;—in the *Ācāramayūkha* (p. 65) as
laying down the time for the morning *Homa*;—and in the
*Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 410.)

In Adhyāya I (Verse 103) are found the words ‘this should be studied by
the learned Brāhmaṇa’; and though this is a mere *Arthavāda*, yet the
presence of the potential affix ‘*tavya*’ (in the term ‘*adhyetavyam*’)
might lead people into the mistake that it is an Injunction; and in that
case the Kṣatriya and Vaiśya would be precluded from the study. It is
with a view to preclude this possibility that we have the present verse,
which shows the capability of the *Kṣatriya* and the *Vaiśya* also to
study.

The older commentators have also taken this verse as serving to preclude
the possibility of the Śūdra studying the scripture, which he might be
tempted to do.

The term ‘*scripture*’ here stands for the compilation by Manu.

‘*Entitled*,’—the ‘title’ meant here consists in the idea that ‘this
should be done by me.’ But no ‘collection of words’—which is an
accomplished entity—can be regarded as ‘to be done’; nor, on the other
band, can any action be regarded as ‘to be accomplished,’ except as
related to a certain substance. Hence the ‘*title*’ is understood to
pertain to a certain action relating to the scripture. Now in the
present context, the action intended is not found to be either *making*,
or *being*, or *existing*; as for ‘being’ and ‘existing,’ they both mean
‘to be’; so that if these were the action meant, the meaning would
be—‘one should undertake the *being* or the *existing*, as related to
the scripture’; but as a matter of fact the ‘being’ of one thing cannot
be undertaken by another. The action of ‘making’ also would not be
applicable; because so far as the *words* are concerned, all are eternal
(and as such cannot be *made*); while as regards *sentences*, they have
been already *made* by another person (the author of the scripture).
From all this it follows that the action intended is that of *studying*
as pertaining to the scripture. So that the meaning comes to be
this—‘the man is entitled to the study of the scripture’; and just as to
the studying, so also to the learning of its meaning.

“In as much as the work of Manu has had a beginning in time, how could
any injunction relating to it (as the present verse is supposed to be)
be based upon the Veda, which is beginningless?”

Our answer is as follows:—It is quite open to us to infer some such
general (Vedic) injunction as that ‘the Śūdra should not study such
sentences as serve to expound the scriptures.’ Further, these statements
of the expounders of the Veda that serve to explain Vedic texts bear a
certain resemblance to these texts; and hence they are as much the
subject of a bcginningless tradition as the Vedic texts themselves.

What forms the subject-matter of the scriptures is actual *performance*,
and to this all the four castes arc entitled \[though to the *study* of
the scriptures the three twice-born castes alone are entitled\].

“If such be the case, then it would be permissible for the *Śūdra* to
perform all those acts which are prescribed in a general manner, without
reference to any specified persons.”

How this contingency does, not arise we shall show, as occasion arises.

*Objection*:—

> “When the *Śūdra* is not entitled to study the scripture and learn its
> meaning, how can he be entitled to the performance of the acts therein
> prescribed? Unless the man knows the exact form of the act, he cannot
> do it; unless he studies the scriptures, he cannot know what is
> contained in them; and no unlearned person is entitled to the
> performance of any (religious) act.”

True; but the requisite knowledge can be obtained from the advice of
other persons. The *Śūdra* may be dependent upon a Brāhmaṇa; or a
Brāhmaṇa may be doing the work of instructing people for payment; and
such a Brāhmaṇa might very well instruct the Śūdra to ‘do this, after
having done that’ and so forth. So that the mere fact of the Śūdra
performing the acts does not necessarily indicate that he is entitled to
the study and understanding of the scriptures; as performance can be
accomplished, even on the strength of what is learnt from others; as is
done in the case of women; what helps women (in the performance of their
duties) is the learning of their husbands, which becomes available to
them through companionship. Then again, the texts laying down the acts
do not imply the direct knowledge (of the injunctive texts). It is only
in the case of men, to whom is addressed the injunction of Vedic
study—contained in the words ‘one should study the Veda’—that the
performance of duties proceeds upon the basis of their own learning; and
this injunction is meant only for the *male* member’s of the three
higher castes. But in the case of these also their study and
understanding of the scriptures is not prompted by their knowledge of
what is contained in them; it is prompted entirely by the two
injunctions—(1) the injunction of having recourse to a duly qualified
teacher, and (2) the injunction of Vedic study.

‘Conception,’ is ‘ impregnation ’; that series of sacraments which
begins with this is called ‘*niṣēkādiḥ*,’ ‘*beyinning conception*.’ This
sacrament is laid down as to be performed after the marriage (of the
parents),—with the *mantra* ‘*viṣṇuryoniṅkalpayatu*,’ etc. (*Ṛgveda*,
10.18.1.1)—on the occasion of the first intercourse only, for some
people, while for others at each menstrual period, till conception takes
place.

That which has the ‘*crematorium*’ for its end is called ‘*ending with
the crematorium*.’ The word ‘crematorium’ stands for that place where
dead bodies are disposed of; and through association it indicates the
rites performed for the dead, called the ‘*Antyeṣṭi*’; as it is only
this performance that is done with *mantras*, and not the *place* (which
is what is directly denoted by the word ‘crematorium’).

The qualification mentioned in the text points to the Twice-born castes;
it is only these persons who have their sacraments done with *mantras*.
The author does not say simply ‘*dvijātīnām*,’ ‘for the twicc-born’ (and
he has taken to the round-about way of saying the same thing), because
Manu Svāyambhuva has a peculiar style of composing his verses.

The passage is not to be construed to mean that ‘the sacraments are laid
down *in mantras*’; because *mantras* do not contain the injunction of
any acts; they are not injunctive; they only serve as *reminders*,
during the performance of the act, of the details enjoined in other
texts. Hence the passage should be explained as meaning—‘those for whom
the sacraments are laid down as to be done with Mantras.’

‘*None other*,’—is purely explanatory; the rest of the sentence having
already served the purpose of restricting what is said to the twice-born
castes. Or, it may be taken as reiterated for the preventing of the idea
that some one might entertain the notion that ‘what is laid down here is
something that *must* be done by the twice-born castes, while for the
*Śūdra* it is neither prescribed nor interdicted.’—(16)

‘*Mantraiḥ*’—This has been added with a view to exclude the woman and
the Śūdra, whose sacraments are not performed ‘with mantras’ (see 2.66
and 10.127).

Burnell remarks—‘In Vedic times the reception of outsiders into the
community was, to a certain extent, recognised, and ceremonies (*e*.
*g*. the *Vrātyastoma*) were in use for this purpose.’

It is rather difficult to be very dogmatic regarding what was, or what
was not, recognised ‘in Vedic times.’ But if the ceremony of the
*Vrātyaṣtoma* is the sole authority for the statement, then it has to be
borne in mind that the writer has not comprehended the purpose of those
ceremonies. If he had taken the trouble to find out what ‘*vrātya*’
meant, he would have found out that the ceremony was performed for the
*re-admission* of those who had become excluded by reason of the
omission of certain obligatary rites; and it was not meant for admitting
absolute ‘outsiders’.

This verse has been quoted by the Mitākṣarā on 1.3 (p. 6)—in support of
the view that it is the Twice-born persons alone who are entitled to
study the *Dharma Śāstra*.

It is quoted also in the *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 512) to the same
effect—also in the Aparārka (p. 14);—in the *Smṛticandrikā* (p. 18.)
which explains ‘*Niṣeka* as the *Garbhādhāna* sacrament and ‘*smaśāna*’
as the ‘after-death rites;—and in the *Varṣakriyākaumudī* (p. 574) as
implying that the rites are to be performed for the *Śūdra* also, but
without Vedic Mantras.

*Medhātithi* (p. 73, 1. 26)—*Ācāryakoraṇavidhinā
svādyāyādhyayanavidhināca*.’ Here both the *Bhāṭṭa* and the *Prābhākara*
views of *Śāstrārambha* are accepted by the writer.
