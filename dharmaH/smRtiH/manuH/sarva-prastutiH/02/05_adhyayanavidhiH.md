So far we had the section dealing with the Initiatory Ceremony. All that
has been said here pertains to that ceremony.

“Well, if so, then the *Keśānta* (spoken of in 65) would also pertain to
the Initiation.”

Not so, as that sacrament has been laid down as to be performed at its
own time, which comes long after the

Initiatory Ceremony has been finished. So that, even though it is
mentioned in the same context, it becomes connected with other rites by
virtue of the force of syntactical connection. Thus it is that some
people regard the *Keśānta* as to be done after the Final Bath (to say
nothing of the Initiation).

The term ‘*aupanāyanika*’ means *pertaining to the* *Upa* *nayana*, the
initial vowel being prolonged, as in other cases explained before.

‘*Birth*’—being born from their parents; this is what is
‘*marked*’—manifested, perfected—by the said ceremony; even though born,
the boy, before Initiation, is as good as not born; as till then he is
not entitled to any religious acts. Hence the ceremony is what ‘marks’
his birth.

‘*Sanctifies*’—this has been already explained.

The duties with which the initiated boy becomes connected—to which he
becomes entitled,—those that should be performed by the initiated
bov—all these are going to be expounded;—these ‘*now learn*’—(68)

study: it is the best *birth*.’

Brāhmaṇa.’

‘*Should teach*’—should make him learn.

‘*First of all*’;—this does not mean that Cleanliness should be taught
before Right Behaviour and the rest; in fact, there is no order of
sequence intended among those mentioned here; all that the text is going
to lay down is that after the Initiation there should he the teaching of
the observances; and after the pupil has been instructed regarding the
observances, he should proceed with the study of the Veda. Hence if the
text meant that the boy should be taught Fire-kindling and the
Twilight-Devotions before being taught the observances, it would be
laying down for him the reciting of mantras not prescribed anywhere
else,—because each of the two acts mentioned is performed with mantras.
As for ‘cleanliness,’ there can be no fixed time for it; and it must be
taught on the very day on which the boy has been initiated. So also
‘Right Behaviour.’ For these reasons it is clear that the phrase ‘first
of all’ is meant to denote *importance*, and it does not mean that it is
to be taught before everything else.

‘*Cleanliness*’—stands for all those acts that begin with the washing of
the private parts, once, &c., &c. (5. 136) and ending with the *sipping
of water*.

‘*Right Behaviour*’—rising to receive the Teacher and other superiors,
offering them seat and saluting them.

‘*Fire-tending*’—the kindling of fire, and supplying of fuel.

The *devotion* offered at *twiligh*, to the Sun, consists in meditating
upon the form of the Sun. This is what is meant by the
‘*Twilight-Devotions*.’ Or, it may refer to what is going to be
prescribed below, in verse 101.

This is what constitutes the ‘Duty relating to Observances.’—(69)

The Future ending (in ‘*adhyīṣyamāṇaḥ*’) denotes the immediate future;
and means ‘when engaging in study,’ ‘when beginning to study,’ ‘when
desiring to proceed with his study.’

‘*He* *shall be* *taught*, *with hist face* *to* *the north*.’—Gautama
(1.65) has laid down that ‘the pupil should face the east, while the
Teacher faces the west.’

‘*When he has sipped water according to law*’—refers to the rules
prescribed above regarding the sipping of water.

The compound ‘*brahmāñjalikṛtaḥ*’ is to be expounded as ‘he by whom
Brahmāñjali has been formed.’ the past participal adjective
(‘*kṛtaḥ*’)being placed at the end, according to Pāṇini 2.2.37;—the
present compound being analogous to such compounds as ‘*āhitāgni*’ and
the like. Or, we may read ‘*brahmāñjalikṛt*.’

‘*Wears light clothing*’;—*i.e*., with clothes thoroughly washed; a
thorough washing always makes the cloth ‘light’; hence ‘lightness’
indicates *cleanliness*. Or, ‘light clothing’ may be taken in its
literal sense, the lightness of the clothing being meant to serve a
visible purpose: if the boy were

Heavily clad in thick woolen clothes, he would not feel the strokes of
the rope with which he would be struck when found to be inattentive, and
not feeling the stroke, he would not study in the proper manner; and if
the teacher, on this account, found it necessary to remove the cloth
from the back (each time that the rope would be laid on the back), this
would tire the teacher himself; and further, if the boy were struck with
the rope on the naked body, he, would feel great pain.

‘*One who has his organs under full control*’;—*i.e*., one who has fully
subdued all bis organs, both external and internal. The sense is that he
should not turn his eyes this way and that, should not listen to
anything and everything that may be talked of, he should devote all his
attention to his own study.—(70)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Laghuvāsāḥ*’—Lightly cothed,—clothed with washed, and hence light,
dress’ (Medhātithi);—‘with clean clothes (Kullūka);—‘clothed in dress
which is not gorgeous, *i. e*. which is less valuable than the
Teacher’s’ (Rāghavānanda).

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta*, (p. 521); in *Madanapārijāta*
(p. 99);—and in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 523), which having adopted
the reading *prā?listu kṛtāpośo* for *???likṛto'dhvāpyo* explains that
the presence of the two words ‘*āchāntaḥ*’ and ‘*kṛtāpośo*’—both of
which denote *ācamana*—makes it clear that the *ācamana* is to be done
twice.

Burnell refers to Ch. XV of *Prātiśākhya* of the Ṛgveda.

This verse is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (*Saṃskāra*, p. 136), which
notes that this ‘*ācamana*’ forms part of the act of *Reading*;—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 50) which has the same note;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 315);—and in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p.
47a).

*Kāmandaka* (2. 22-23).—‘The duties of the Religious Student are—to live
in the house of his preceptor, to tend the sacred fires, to study the
Veda and its auxiliaries, to observe vows, to perform ablutions three
times, to beg alms, and live with the teacher all his life In the
absence of the preceptor, he may live with the preceptor’s son, or with
one of his fellow-students;—or if he likes, he may adopt another mode of
life.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 1. 52, 54, 60.—‘Touching the organs with
Kuśa-grass;—permitted by the teacher, he should sit to the right of the
teacher, facing the East or the North; touching the teacher’s left foot,
with his hand, be should address the request to the teacher, saving
“*Please sir, teach*.”

*Śaṅkha-Smṛti*, 3. 5.—‘Being permitted by the teacher, one should begin
reading, adopting the *Brahmāñjali* attitude, respectfully looking on
the teacher’s face.’

*Laghu-Vyāsa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 524).—‘He who reads a verse,
or a half or a quarter of it, without the teacher’s permission, is a
*stealer of Veda*, and falls into hell.’

Though the term ‘*brahma*’ has many meanings, yet, in view of the fact
of the present context bearing on ‘study,’ it is taken here as standing
for the *Veda*.

‘*At the beginning of the Veda*’;—the Locative ending denotes
*occasion*; and since the context bears upon ‘study,’ the beginning
meant is that of the action of *study*; and the ‘*beginning*’ stands for
the very *first recitation* by the person concerned. And it is at this
first recitation that the Teacher’s feet are to be clasped. The term
‘beginning’ here cannot stand for the first letters of the
Vedas—‘*agnimīle*’ (Ṛgveda), ‘*ikhe tvorje*’ (Yajurveda), ‘*agna āyāhi*’
(Sāmaveda); because these opening words could never form the *occasion*
(for the clasping of the feet); for the simple reason that (being parts
of the eternal Veda) they are ever present; while it is only what is
itself occasional (occurring only at certain times) that can be the
*occasion* for anything. Hence what is meant is that—‘when one is going
to begin the study of the Veda, he should clasp the Teacher’s feet, and
having done that he should recite the words of the Veda and it does not
mean that he should clasp the Teacher’s feet every time that he may
study the Veda.

“The first moment of the act is what is called its ‘beginning’; and it
is this *beginning* that is spoken of as the *occasion*. Now it is only
what is *existent* that can form the occasion for anything; *e.g*., when
*living existence* is regarded as the occasion for the performance of
*Agnihotra*, it is the *existence* that is *present*. It is true that in
some cases, the burning of the house and such other *past* events also
are spoken of as the occasion for certain acts; but in these cases we
accept them as such because that is what is actually prescribed. In the
present instance however, the ‘beginning of study’ and ‘clasping of the
feet’ should be regarded as simultaneous.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—What is called ‘beginning’ here
is the *making up of one’s mind to study*, and not the *first moment* of
the act. The Boy makes up his mind to study as soon as the Teacher
addresses to him the words ‘now read’; so that it is after this that the
feet are to be clasped. This is intended to be the propitiation of the
Teacher who is going to bestow a favour. Just as in the ordinary world,
when a person is going to bestow a favour upon another, the latte?
welcomes him with the words—‘it is through you that I have been saved
from this sin.’

This clasping of the feet is meant to embody the speechless request—‘we
are ready to proceed with our study’; for the Teacher is never to be
directed with the words ‘now teach us.’ All that is to be done is that
the Boy should approach him (and clasp his feet), with a view to remind
him that it is time for study, and it is only after this approaching has
been done, that the words of the Veda should begin to he recited.

Further, in view of the rule that ‘one should study the Veda with joined
palms,’ if the boy were to study (with joined palms), he would he
transgressing the rule regarding the *damping of feet* (if the *study*
and the were meant to he simultaneous) \[for one who would have his
hands joined could not clasp the feet\].

‘*find*’—Ceasing, desisting from study.

Though the term ‘*brahma*’ is the subordinate factor in the compound
(‘*brahmārambhe*’) yet, in as much as the term ‘end’ is a relative term,
it is taken as correlated to the term ‘*brahma*’; specially because
there is no other word in the text with which it could be connected.

‘*Always*’—implies that this rule regarding the clasping of feet should
he observed at the beginning and end of all future study, *every day*.
If this word were not present, the rule would be taken as applying to
only that ‘beginning of study’ which comes immediately after the
Initiatory Ceremony; on the analogy of the *Ārambhaṇīyā Iṣṭi*, which is
performed only at the beginning of the first sacrifice performed by the
*Agnihotrin*, after he has done the ‘Fire-kindling,’ and *not* at that
of each succeeding *pūrnamāsa*, which is performed every month.

From morning till such time as the daily routine of reciting two
Chapters has not been finished, the whole is regarded as a single act of
‘study’; so that if at intervals, there is some obstruction, the
resuming of study on the same day is not regarded as ‘beginning’; and at
each resumption, the feet are not clasped. In another *Smṛti* we
read—‘The clasping of the Teacher’s feet should be done every day in the
morning.’ Gautama, 2.53).

‘*Having joined*’—making them touch one another.

‘*Should be studied*’;—what is meant is that the hands should he placed
in that posture which resembles the tortoise.

‘*This is Brahmāñjali*’;—this explains the meaning of the term
‘*brahmāñjali*’—(71)

The ‘clasping of the Teacher’s feet’ mentioned in the preceding verse
‘*should be done with crossed hands*.’

In answer to the question as to what sort of the ‘crossing’ of hands
should be done, the Author adds—‘*the left*’ foot ‘*should be touched
with the left*’ hand; it is mere touching that should be done, the
Teacher should not be troubled by the foot being held for a long time.
This ‘crossing’ is obtained by the two hands being simultaneously moved
towards one another. That is, the feet having to be clasped by the pupil
standing in front of the Teacher; the left hand is moved towards the
right and the right towards the left; it is thus that the left foot
becomes touched by the left hand and the right foot by the right hand.
This is the ‘crossing of the hands.’

Others read the text as ‘*vinyastapāṇinā*,’ ‘with well-placed hands.’
The ‘placing’ being implied by the *touching*, what the addition of the
epithet would imply is that the feet should not be touched merely with
the finger tips,—in the way in which a red-hot piece of iron is touched,
for fear of burning,—but the hands should be ‘well-plaed,’ actually held
upon the feet. Pressing of the feet would cause pain to the Teacher, and
is as such prohibited. Such is the explanation provided of this version
of the text.—(72)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 455), where it is
explained that the ‘left’ and ‘right’ of the second half stand for the
left and right *feet*; so that the meaning is that the left foot of the
teacher should be touched by the left hand and the right one by the
right hand; and it quotes Baudhāyann laying down that the pupil should
pass his hands from the knee downwards to the foot.

A similar explanation is given also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p.
300).

The verse is quoted also in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 52.1);—in *Aparārka*

‘*gurucaraṇaḥ*’ understood;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 103),

teacher are to be touched with the left and right hands respectively.

‘*When going to study*’ and the other expressions have already been
explained before. The present verse adds a direction for the Teacher.
When a boy is desirous to read the Veda from a Teacher, he should be
invited with the words ‘ho, read!’ Until he is so invited, the Boy
should not press the Teacher with such importunate requests as—‘please
teach us this chapter!’ Another *Smṛti* has declared—‘One should study
on being invited to do so’. (Yājñavalkya, Ācāra, 27).

Saying the words ‘*let there be a stop*,’ ‘*he should
cease*’—desist,—‘who is to cease?’—The Teacher; as is clear from the
nominative case-ending used. Or, it may be taken to mean that the
*pupil* should cease only when dismissed by the Teacher, and not
according to his own wish; the construction of the passage in this case
being—‘when the Teacher says *let there be a stop*, then the pupil
*should cease*.’

Other people have explained this rule regarding the time of ceasing as
applying to all readers—the pupil as well as the Teacher. And this is in
accordance with another *Smṛti*, which says—“Having recited the Veda, at
the time of ceasing, one should touch the ground with the fore-finger
and pronounce ‘*svasti*’ in the case of the Yajurveda, ‘*vispaṣṭām*’ in
the case of the Sāman, ‘*virāmaḥ*’ in the case of the Ṛgveda and
‘*āramasva*’ in the case of the Atharva.”

‘*Free from indolence*’—without sloth; ‘indolence’ is *sloth*;—the man
beset with sloth is called ‘indolent’; and when he has given it up he is
called ‘*from indolence*.’ This is meant to be merely descriptive.
‘Indolence’ here does not mean *fatigue*. The present text should never
be taken to mean that what is here laid down is for only one who is free
from indolence, while for those beset with indolence there is some other
rule.—(73)

and at the end, should finish with the words ‘*Let there he a stop*;’

Here also, in accordance with what has gone before (under 71), ‘*one
should pronounce the Praṇava in the beginning and at the end of the
Veda*’;—which means that the syllable is to be pronounced in the
beginning and at the end of the action of reading the Veda.

The term ‘*praṇava*’ stands for the syllabic ‘*oṃ*’; as is clear from
what the text adds later on—‘not accompanied *by the syllable oṃ*.’

‘*Always*’—has been added in order to show that the rule applies to
every act of study. Without this term it would appear, from the context,
that it applies to only that *first* study by the Religious Student
which is done for the getting up of the text. When the adverb ‘always’
has been added, it becomes clear that the rule applies to all forms of
studying,—that which is done for the purpose of keeping the memory of
the text fresh, or that which is done by the Householder and other
people in obedience to the injunction that ‘the Veda should be studied
every day.’ As regards the reciting of Vedic mantras during the Twilight
Prayer, etc., the use of the syllable ‘oṃ’ the author is going to enjoin
directly (in Verse 78). What is laid down here is not meant to be a
necessary accompaniment of the Veda,—which would mean that the rule is
to be followed whenever one pronounces any Vedic passage; thus it is
that the Praṇava is not used with Vedic mantras on the following
occasions: at oblations poured into fire, or during the *japa* of
mantras, or in course of the teaching of scriptures, or at the
recitation of the ‘*Yājyā*’ and other hymns, or when Vedic passages are
quoted only by way of illustration. From all this it follows that the
adverb ‘*always*’ is meant to show only that the rule laid down applies
to that study of the Veda which forms the subject-matter of the context.
As for the necessity of using the *Praṇava* at the beginning of one’s
daily study, this is secured by the construing of the term ‘always’ of
the preceding verse with the present one.

In praise of what has been enjoined the text adds—‘*If it is not
accompanied by the syllable oṁ*, etc.’ If, in the beginning, the Veda is
not accompanied by the syllable ‘oṃ,’ *it trickles off*. The compound
‘*anoṅkṛtam*’ is to be expounded as ‘that which is not
*accompanied*,—*i.e*., sanctified—by the syllable *oṃ*’ according to
Pāṇini, 2. 1. 32; or, it may be expounded as ‘that Veda in which the
syllable *oṁ* is not uttered,’—the order of the terms in this case being
in accordance with the rule laid down in connection with the ‘*Sukhādi*’
group, according to Pāṇini, 6. 2. 170.

‘*At the end*’—at the close. The particle ‘and’ indicates that the term
‘not accompanied by the syllable *om*’ is to be construed here also.

‘*Trickles off-—becomes shattered*.’—Both these terms are meant to
indicate the futility of the study. The sense being that that religious
act, in which the Veda studied in the said defective fashion is used,
absolutely fails to accomplish its purpose. This is an *Arthavāda* meant
to be deprecatory of the said method of study. When milk is placed in a
pot, the milks passes off all round; and this is what is called
‘*trickling off*’; and if the milk becomes destroyed after it has been
boiled and become solidified, this is what is called ‘*becoming
shattered*.’—(74)

The term ‘*kūṭa*’ means ‘kuśa-blade’;—‘*Seated upon*’ them,—*i.e*.,
seated upon kuśa-blades pointing eastwards. The accusative ending in
‘*kūṭān*’ being in accordance with Pāniṇi 1. 4. 46, ‘*adhisthīnsthāsām
karma*,’ where the latter part consists of the factors
‘*athā*’—‘*ā*’—‘*āsām*.’ In the word ‘*paryupāsīnaḥ*’ also we have an
‘*ā*’, the word containing the factors
‘*pari*’—‘*upa*’—‘*ā*’—‘*āsīnaḥ*’; the prefixes ‘*pari*’ and ‘*upa*’
having no significance at all.

‘*Sanctified by kuśa-blades*’;—*i.e*., having been made pure. The term
‘*pavitra*’ cannot stand for the *Aghamarṣaṇa* and other mantras; for
the simple reason that at the time that the text is being dealt with,
the student has not read those *mantras*. Nor are kuśa-blades capable,
by their mere presence, to bring about purification for one who does no
(purificatory) act; thus then, the necessity of some intervening act
being essential, we are led to conclude, on the basis of another
*Smṛti*, that this act is in the form of *touching the sense-organs*;
Gautama (1.48-50) having prescribed ‘the touching of the organs with
Kuśa-blades and seating upon Kuśa-blades pointing eastwards.’

‘*Purified by means of three Breath-suspensions*’—The air passing
through the mouth and the nostrils is called ‘*prāṇa*,’ ‘breath’; and
the ‘*āyāma*’ of this is its *suspension, holding within the body,
preventing its going out*. Another *Smṛti* (Yājñavalkya, *Ācāra*, 23)
has laid down the measure of the time during which the breath is to be
suspended—as also the mantra accompanying it,—“One, witholding his
breath, should mutter three times the *Gāyatrī* along with the *Praṇava*
and the *Śiras*,—this is what is called ‘Breath-suspension’.” The
revered Vaśiṣṭha has added to these the *Great Vyāhṛtis* also. It is the
end of the mantra that should mark the end of the *suspension*, no other
limit for it being prescribed. In as much as all Smṛtis are meant to
serve the same purpose, we must accept this same method of
‘Breath-suspension’ to be meant by the present text also, specially as
there is no inconsistency with it.

*Objection*.—“What has been said here involves a mutual interdependence:
until the Breath-suspensions have been performed one should not
pronounce ‘Oṃ,’ while without this syllable ‘Oṃ’ there can be no
‘Breath-suspension’.”

There is nothing wrong in this. When Yājñavalkya lays down that ‘one
should mutter three times; etc.,’ all that is meant is the mental act of
*remembering, thinking of*, the syllable ‘*Oṃ*’; for when the breath is
suspended, there can be no *utterance* of any syllable; though it is
true that ‘*Japa*,’ ‘Reciting,’ is (in most cases) something that can be
accomplished only by an operation of speech. In connection with the
reading of the Veda however, what is intended is actual *utterance* of
the syllable; and this for the simple reason that the act of reading
consists of actual utterance—the root (in ‘*adhyayana*’) signify ing the
*waking of sound*, and *sound* is that which is heard by the *Ear*, and
not that which is cognised only by the mind.

What is prescribed here is not something applicable to the syllable ‘Oṃ’
itself,—whereby it could be made applicable to the uttering of the
syllable on other occasions also. It has been said that the syllable
should be pronounced at the beginning of Vedic study; but if the. rule
here laid down were meant to be applicable to all utterances of the
syllable, it would have to be observed in connection with such
utterances of it in ordinary parlance as when one says ‘we say *yes*
(oṃ).’

Then again, Gautama (l.49) has declared that. ‘the three
Breath-suspensions extend over fifteen moments.’ The term ‘*mātrā*,’
‘moment,’ stands for that point of time which is taken up in the
pronouncing of a simple unmodified vowel; and in as much as this cannot
be consistent with the time-limit prescribed by Yājñavalkya, this latter
cannot be accepted as applicable to what is prescribed by Gautama; in
which connection again no mantras are laid down. From this it is clear
that there can be ‘Breath-suspensions’ even without the uttering of the
syllable ‘oṃ.’ And thus there need be no mutual interdependence.

Then alone does the man ‘*become entitled to the syllable oṃ*’;—*i.e*.,
to the ‘pronouncing’ of the syllable,—the word ‘pronouncing’ having to
be supplied if the entire term ‘*oṅkāra*’ is taken as standing for the
*Praṇava*. If however we take the term ‘*kār*’ separately in the sense
of *making*,—so that ‘*oṁkāra*’ means the *making* or *uttering* of the
syllable ‘oṃ,’—then we do not need to supply any other word. The
uttering of the syllable having been laid down (under 74), where it is
called ‘*praṇava*’;—the term ‘*oṅkāra*’ in the present sense simply
serves the purpose of explaining what that ‘*praṇava*’ is.

So that ‘*praṇava*’ and ‘*oṅkāra*’ are synonymous terms; as we have
already pointed out (in the Bhāṣya on 74).—(75)

‘*Pavitraiḥ*’—‘Kuśa-blades—by which the seat of the vital airs is
touched’—(Medhātithi);—‘The *Aghamarṣaṇa*’ and other Vedic texts (noted
by Medhātithi, but rejected by him, though adopted by Nandana). Burnell
has translated the term as ‘grass-rings on the third finger’;—this is in
exact conformity with the present usage, where a blade of Kuśa, twisted
into the form of a ring, is worn on the third finger on the occasion of
all religious ceremonies.

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 521);—in *Vīramitrodaya*
(Saṃskāra, p. 522), which explains ‘*prākkūlān*’ as *prāgagrān*
‘pointing eastwards’,—and ‘*pavitraiḥ*’ simply as ‘*pāranaiḥ*’
‘purificatories’;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 49), which explains
‘*prākkūlān*’ as ‘with tips pointing towards the east’;—in
*Saṃskāraratnamālā* (p. 316) which has the same explanations and adds
that it refers to Kuśa-blades;—in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 135)
which has the same explanation and explains ‘*pavitraiḥ*’ as
purificatory;—also in *Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 471).

Kuśa-blades;—there should be three Breath-suspensions, of fifteen units;
and the seat should be on Kuśa-grass pointing eastwards.’

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 2.4.5,7.—‘At the commencement of the
performance of all acts, as also before the Twilight Prayers, one should
sprinkle himself with the sanctifying blades and thereby prepare
himself;—to this effect it is declared that seated on Kuśa-blades,
holding Kuśa-blades in the hand, sprinkling himself with water, one
should repeat the Gāyatrī a thousand times;—being purified with three
Breath-suspensions.’

*Kūrmapurāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Āhnika, p. 254).—‘Seated on Kuśa-blades
pointing eastwards, with mind collected, he should perform throe
Breath-suspensions and then the Twilight Prayers.’

The present verse is a valedictory description of the origin of the
*Gāyatrī* -verse beginning with the words ‘*tat savitur vareṇyam*,’
which serves the purpose of introducing the coming injunction. As for
the injunction of the *Vyāhṛtis*, this is to be deduced from the
valedictory description contained in the preceding verse. As for the
actual order in which the several syllables have to be pronounced, that
is ascertained from the order in which they are found mentioned in tho
text. The author is also going to lay down in the next verse—‘They
should pronounce this syllable (om), and this verse (‘*tat* *savitur*,
etc.’), preceded by the *Vyāhṛtis*.’

‘*Milked*’—churned out.

“*Beginning with ‘tat*’;”—though this being all that the text says, it
might refer to an altogether different verse—‘*tat savitur vṛṇimahe*,
etc.’ (Ṛgveda, 5. 82. 1), which is not three-footed,—yet it is the
three-footed verse that should he taken as referred to here; and it is
the ‘*Sāvitrī*’ verse that is *three-footed*.

In as much as *Kaśyapa* and other sagos are also called ‘*Prajāpati*,’
the text has added the qualification ‘*Supreme*’; so that it is
Hiraṇyagarbha that becomes specified; as it is He who *dwells on, the
highest* *spot*, from where there is no reversion (to worldliness).

This has been added with a view to show the extreme importance of the
*Sāvitrī* verse;—it was churned by the highest of all Prajāpatis, out of
the Vedas.—(77)

Though this verse is syntactically connected with the section dealing
with the Injunction of Vedic study, yet it is to be taken as embodying
the injunction of recitation during the Twilight-Prayers; and as regards
the ‘*Gāyatrī*’-verse itself, the mention of it (in the present verse)
is merely for the purposes of *reference* (the injunction of its
recitation having already gone before), while that of the *Praṇava* and
the *Vyāhṛtis* forms the direct injunction of the recitation of these,
which has not been enjoined anywhere else.

To this some people make the following objection:—

“This cannot be regarded as an Injunction pertaining to the Twilight
Prayers; as these do not form the subject-matter of the present context.
Even if it was an injunction, it could only be one pertaining to the
Religious Student; as it is the Student whose duties are being
propounded in the present context. But this is not possible, since the
text has added the qualification ‘*learned in the Veda*’; and certainly
the student just initiated could never be ‘learned in the Veda.’
Further, the text also adds a particular fruit—‘*becomes endowed with
Vedic merit*’; while the Injunction of the Twilight-Prayers is a
compulsory one. Then again, we do not understand what is this fruit,
called ‘Vedic merit’ which is described as proceeding from the
recitation. If what is meant is the merit proceeding from the recitation
of the Veda, and if the attaining of this merit is what is meant by
being ‘endowed with Vedic merit’—then, in regard to this view it has to
be noted that so far as the Injunction of Veda-reciting is
concerned—which forms the subject-matter of the present context,—there
can be no other result proceeding from it, except the understanding of
the meaning of tho Vedic texts; for the simple reason that no such
result has been anywhere mentioned. Further, in as much as there is a
perceptible result in the shape of the comprehension of meaning, there
can be no room for the assuming of any other results. The injunction of
Veda-reciting that there is for the Householder and others,—in the words
‘day after day one should recite the Veda’—this also is a compulsory
one; and the results mentioned in connection with it, in the shape of
‘milk, and honey, etc.,’ this is only a valedictory supplement. From all
this it is clear that the present verse cannot be regarded as an
Injunction (of recitation during the Twilight Prayers). Specially as, if
it were taken as an Injunction, all the above difficulties will have to
be explained. On the other band, if the verse be taken as a valedictory
reference, then the term ‘reciting’ could be taken as referring to the
Reciting of the Veda, which forms the subject-matter of the context; and
in that case it would be possible to construe the term ‘Vedic merit’
also in some way or the other.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—

It has been already explained that the implications of context are
always set aside by those of Syntactical Connection; and for the very
reason that the terms ‘learned in the Veda’ and ‘Twilight prayers’ are
not connected with the subject-matter of the context,—the present
Injunction is to be taken as pertaining to something else. The
Injunction is simply to the effect that during the two Twilight Prayers
one should pronounce the three expressions (*Om—Sāvitrī
verse*—*Vyāhṛtis*); and the term ‘learned in the Veda’ is merely
descriptive?

“But as a matter of fact, it is possible only for persons in the
Householder and other stages to be ‘learned in the Veda’; the Student
can never be so.

What has this *possibility* got to do with the matter? If the term is
taken as merely descriptive of what is already known from other sources,
then the injunction contained in the verse becomes applicable to people
in all stages of life. While if the term ‘learned in the Veda’ were
taken as a significant epithet of the Nominative agent (of the act
enjoined), then the student would not be entitled to the act.

“Why should the term be taken as merely descriptive?”

For the simple reason that there would (otherwise) be a syntactical
split. The injunction pertaining to the Injunction of the Twilight
Prayers, what has to be enjoined regarding it is the reciting of the
*Praṇava* and the *Vyāhṛtis*, which has not been enjoined anywhere else,
Now, if in addition to these, something else were taken as enjoined,—in
the form of ‘being learned in the Veda,’—then there would be a
syntactical split \[the sentence in question containing two injunctions,
(*a*) ‘should recite the Praṇava, etc.,’ and (*b*) ‘should learn the
Veda’\]; and it is not legitimate to enjoin (by means of a single
sentence) several details pertaining to an act already enjoined. Nor is
it possible (as another alternative) to take the mention of the
*Praṇava* and the *Vyāhṛtis* as merely descriptive \[because their
injunction has not been met with anywhere else\].

From all this it follows that what the Text means is as follows:—‘In
connection with the *reciting of the Gāyatrī* that has been enjoined in
relation to the Twilight Prayers, there is this further detail that the
said recitation is to lie preceded by the uttering of the *Praṇava* and
the *Vyāhṛtis*.’

The mention of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa'* is only by way of illustration.

It has been argued above that—“the text speaks of a result, while the
Injunction of the Twilight Prayers is a compulsory one.”

But what inconsistency is there in this? While what is enjoined is a
compulsory act, the result mentioned may follow from the further detail
mentioned in the text; the meaning being that ‘the said result follows
from the previously enjoined Twilight Prayer, when it is accompanied by
the recitation of the *Praṇava* and the *Vyāhṛtis*. Just as when the
ordinary Agnihotra is performed with the water brought over in the
milking vessel, there comes about the particular result in the shape of
cattle; and this in (?) accordance with the injunction that ‘for one
desiring cattle water should be brought in the milking vessel.’

It is on the strength of this last injunction that we have made bold to
say what we have said above. In reality the injunction contained in the
verse is not an optional one at all (meant only for those desiring the
particular result mentioned). Specially as another *Smṛti* (Yājñavalkya,
1. 23) clearly lays it down as a compulsory injunction—‘One should
recite the *Gāyatrī* along with the *Śiras*, preceded by the
*Vyāhṛtis*.’

Further, you have yourself argued that the exact nature of the result
(‘Vedic merit’) cannot be ascertained (which is an argument against the
text being taken as laying down a result). As a matter of fact, what
‘Vedic merit’ means is as follows:—‘The merit that has been described in
the Veda as resulting from the saying of the Twilight Prayers accrues to
man only when he recites all the three expressions—and not by reciting
the *Gāyatrī* only.’ ‘*Puṇya*,’ ‘*merit*,’ is *excellence*. Since
*Smṛtis* are based upon the *Veda*, what is mentioned in the *Smṛtis* is
also called ‘Veda-merit,’ which last expression stands for the ‘*merit
of the Veda*.’

“What is the merit of the Veda?”

That (merit) which is expounded by the Veda. The merit that results from
the Veda being recited may also be called ‘the merit of the Veda’; but
by virtue of the specific relationship, it is what is expounded by the
Veda,—and what is *produced* by it—that should be spoken of as ‘merit of
the Veda.’ As for the *producing* of merit, this is done by other things
also, such as sacrificial performances and the like; while the
*expounding* of it is done by the Veda only.

Some people have taken the last foot of the Verse to mean as
follows—“What has been enjoined as compulsory Vedic Study becomes
fulfilled merely by reciting the three expressions during the Twilight
Prayers.”

But this is not right. For if the present text meant this, then it would
be providing an option to what has been laid down as the compulsory
‘Vedic Study’; and this would mean the partial rejection of this study.
But so long as we can avoid it, it is not right to admit the rejection
of any injunction.

‘*This syllable*’—refers to the syllable ‘*oṃ*.’

“But this is not a single *letter*, containing as it does, two or three
syllables.”

Our answer is that the term ‘syllable’ here stands for ‘vowel-sound’ and
‘contact with consonants.’ Hence the term denotes that which forms the
subject-matter of the context.

‘*This Verse*’—*i.e*., the *Sāvitrī* verse ‘*tat saviturvareṇyam*, etc.’

‘*Preceded by the Vyāhṛtis*;’—*i.e*., that before which the *Vyāhṛtis*
have been uttered. Here only the *three Vyāhṛtis* are meant,—these alone
having been mentioned in the present context (in verse 76),—and not the
*seven*, ending with ‘*Satyam*.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

The term ‘*bahiḥ*,’ ‘in *open air*,’ stands for *uncovered spot*; the
sense being that it should be done outside towns and villages, on the
bank of rivers and such places.

‘*A thousand times, repeating*’—reciting it again and again.

“The affix ‘*kṛtvasuch*’ (in the term ‘*Sahasrakṛtvaḥ*’) also signifies
*repetition*, which is again denoted by the word ‘*abhyasya*’ also; so
there is needless repetition.”

The repetition is not objectionable, in view of a distinction between
general and particular. That is to say, the word ‘*abhyasya*’ denotes
repetition *in* *general*, and when the question arises as to the
*particular* number of repetitions, we have the text adding ‘*a thousand
times*.’ Both the general and the particular could not be regarded as
signified by the single word ending with the ‘*kṛtvasuch*’ affix;
because this latter word always stands in need of a particular act (that
has to be done a thousand times). The mere expression ‘*devadattaḥ*
*pan* *chakritvo’haḥ*,’ ‘Devadatta five times during the day’ does not
signify anything until the word ‘*bhuṅkte*,’ ‘*Eats*,’ is added.

“But the term ‘*repeating*’ also does not signify any particular *act*.”

True; but the act of *reciting* forms the subject-matter of the context;
so that the *repeating* is understood as pertaining to that act;
‘*repetition*’ standing for *attending to it again and again*.

‘*Even from great sin*’;—he becomes freed from even such heinous sins as
‘Brāhmaṇa-killing’ and the like; what to say of minor offences?

‘*Api*,’ ‘*Even*,’ denotes *possibility*, not *cumulation*; cumulation
is expressed when more things than one are mentioned separately; as in
the sentence—‘there is sovereignty of Devadatta, *and* of Yajñadatta
*also*.’ There is no such separate mention in the text.

*Question*—“From what minor offences does the man become freed?
*Cow-killing* and such acts have been regarded as ‘minor offences’; and
for every one of these the scriptures have prescribed distinct expiatory
rites along with all their details. While as regards those acts that are
not done consciously, but which are regarded as *must have been
done*,—though no definite expiation could be prescribed for them, yet
they would be got rid of by means of the Twilight Prayers and such other
compulsory rites prescribed for daily performance. Then again, if what
is mentioned in the present verse were a real expiation, it should have
come under the section on Expiatory Rites (Ch. XI); just as it is said
(under 11. 77)—‘One may recite the text of the Veda while keeping due
restraint over food.’ Further, if the present verse were meant to
prescribe an expiatory rite, the whole section dealing with Expiatory
Rites (Ch. XI) would he superfluous. For, what accused person would omit
to do the expiation consisting of the mere reciting of mantras, and go
in for the very difficult rites endangering the body and very life
itself? Says an old saying—‘If honey were available in a place within
easy reach, wherefore should one go to the hills? The desired end having
been accomplished, which wise man could put forth further efforts?’—and
again—‘What can he obtained for a single coin, no wise man purchases for
ten coins.’ Nor can the verse be taken as a valedictory supplement to
what forms the subject-matter of the context (*i.e*., Vedic Study),
because there is no ground for connecting it syntactically with the
context,—such grounds, for instance, as being found defective if taken
apart from the context and so forth.”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—The present verse is a direct
Injunction; and the act laid down is done for the removing of sins. It
has been argued that—“What is laid down here (being too easy) could not
be regarded as optional with those rites that are prescribed in a
different context and are very much more difficult.” But it can
certainly be taken as optional with those expiations which consist in
Mantra-recitations. For instance, the reciting of the *Mantra* has been
declared as destroying all sins; and with this what is laid down in the
present verse could be taken as optional. In connection with the
*Aghamarṣaṇa-Mantra*, three days fasting is prescribed, while according
to what is laid down in the present verse, the man becomes freed by
doing th e reciting for a month, but taking two ordinary meals every
day. Thus the difference between the two is not so great as to lead us
to regard them as very diverse in character.

Or, what is mentioned here may be taken as purifying the man from such
past sins as arc indicated by the evil position of planets, etc.; and it
is from these sins that the man becomes free. ‘*Sin*’ is something
undesirable; from this the man *becomes freed*,—*i.e*., is not affected
by the results of those sins.

‘*Just as the snake from the slough*,’—just as the snake becomes freed
from the cast-off skin. This means that the sin is completely removed.

For such past sins as are indicated by the discolouring of the skin and
such other diseases, other *Smṛtis* have prescribed many expiatory
rites. All this we shall explain under the section on Expiatory Rites.

It is in view of what, is said in the present verse that we have the
saying—‘There is no fall for people who go on reciting *mantras* and
pouring libations.’—(79)

‘*Vahiḥ*’—Burnell represents Medhātithi as explaining this term to be
‘on a river-island and the like.’ This is not right; the word used by
Medhātithi is ‘*nadīpulinādau*’—which means ‘on the *bank* of rivers and
such places’.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 1220) where ‘*vahiḥ*’ is
explained as ‘outside the village’—and ‘*trikam*’ as ‘the Sāvitrī along
with the Vyāhṛtis’;—and in *Gadādharapaddhai* (Kālasāra, p. 30), which
explains ‘*trikam*’ as (1) *Praṇava*. (2) *Vyāhṛti* and (3) *Gāyatrī*.

‘*By this verse*’—by the *Sāvitrī*.

‘*Bereft*’;—he who fails to observe the Twilight Prayers and neglects
Vedic Study.

‘*Odium*’—Blame.

‘*Among good men*’—Among the highly cultured people.

‘*Incurs*’—becomes open to.

With a view to show what sort of odium he incurs, the Text adds—‘*and of
the timely performance of his own duty*.’—‘*Timely*’—*e.g*., the
sixteenth year for the Brāhmaṇa and so forth. When the man is bereft of
these rites, he becomes despised.

From this it is clear that even though the boy may have been
*initiated*, and as such become qualified for Vedic Study,—yet, if he is
bereft of the *Sāvitrī*, he becomes a ‘*Vrātya*,’ apostate.

What is meant by ‘*his own duty*’ is just that duty which is common to
the three castes; and this is the duty of Initiation. It is only when we
interpret it thus that the qualification ‘timely’ comes to have any
sense. If the ‘duty’ meant were the duties of Vedic Study and the rest,
the text would have said simply ‘performance of his own duty’ (without
the qualification ‘timely’).

The term ‘*yoni*’ being synonymous with ‘*birth*’ denotes *caste*. So
what is meant is the person of the Brāhmaṇa and other castes.

The present verse is only a descriptive supplement, added for the
purpose of making the Expiatory Rites prescribed for the *Vrātya*
(apostate) applicable to the omissions mentioned here.—(80)

“*Preceded by the syllable Oṃ*”—in the beginning of which the syllable
‘Oṃ’ occurs.—‘*Mahāvyāhṛtis*’;—this refers to the three syllables
‘*bhūḥ*—*bhuvaḥ*—*svaḥ*,’ which form the subject-matter of the present
context.

‘*Imperishable*’;—the syllables are so called in view of the fact that
the results proceeding from their repetition are longstanding. If this
were not meant, then the qualification would be superfluous, as all
words are equally imperishable, eternal.

*Three-footed Sāvitrī*;—the verse ‘*tat savituḥ*, *etc*.’

‘*The mouth of Brahman*.’—These are called ‘mouth’ in the sense that
they form its opening. Hence this verse is to be regarded as the
valedictory supplement of the Injunction that these should be recited at
the beginning of Vedic Study.

Or ‘mouth’ may mean *portal*, the means;—the sense being that *union
with Brahman* is reached by this means. This is what is described in the
next verse.—(81)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Brahmaṇo mukham*—“Literally, the *mouth of Brahman* is meant to convey
the double sense (of *leading to*, and *leading to union with*,
*Brahman*). Both interpretations are given by Medhātithi, Kullūka. and
Rāghavānanda; while Govindarāja, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana explain it merely
as the *beginning or portal of the Veda*.”—Buhler.

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 71) as defining the
‘*Brahmamukha*’, which has been declared by Nārāyaṇa to be the formula
for the *Ācamana*;—in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 522), as laying down
the beginning of study;—in the same work again (Āhnika, p. 253), where
it is explained as meaning that the name ‘*sandhyā*’ (Twilight Prayers)
is applied to all those acts that are performed with the formula herein
specified;—also on p. 321, along with the next three verses.

This first line of this verse is quoted in *Aparārka*, (p. 1290).

The verse is quoted in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 50), which explains
‘*tisraḥ*’ as ‘*Bhūḥ-bhuvaḥ-svaḥ*’ and ‘*brahmaṇo mukham*’ as ‘to be
pronounced at the beginning of Vedic reading—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 135), which notes—‘*om bhūrbhuvaḥsvaḥ*’ are the three
*Vyāhṛtis*,—*tatsavituḥ* &c., is the *Sāvitrī*; all this forms the
‘*mukha*’, *i.e*. beginning, of ‘Brahman’, *i.e*. the Veda.

thousand times, or a hundred times, or without any limit.’

*Yogi- Yājñavalkya* (Do., 283).—‘The Religious Student and the
Agnihotrin should repeat the Gāyatrī 108 times: the Hermit and the
Renunciate, more than 1,000 times,

*Yama* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 286).—‘There is nothing superior to the
Gāyatrī for purposes of *Japa*; there is no penance higher than the
Gāyatrī; there is no meditation higher than the Gāyatrī; there is no
*Homa* higher than the *Viṣṇusmṛti*, 55. 15-16—\[reproduces the words of

*Laugākṣi* (Do.).—‘Having pronounced *om bhūrbhuvaḥsvaḥ*, he pronounces
the Sāvitrī verse beginning with *Tat savituḥ*.’

‘*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 2. 4. 21.—‘The Brāhmaṇa who daily, at all
junctures, meditates upon this, becomes purified to Brahmaṇa and merged
in Brāhmaṇ; following the scriptures, he wins the Brahmic regions.’

*Vyāsa* (Parāśaramādhava, p. 285).—‘By repeating the Gāyatrī ten times
one becomes absolved from all little sins committed during the day;
repeated a hundred times, she destroys a host of sins; repeated a
thousand times, she destroys all minor sins; by repeating it a *lakh* of

of times, one obtains all that is desired.’

*Saṃvarta* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 522).—‘One should utter the
*Praṇava* first: after that, the Vyāhṛtis; and then the Sāvitrī.’

He becomes omnipresent, all-pervading, like *Ākāśa*.

‘*Transfigured into Ākāśa*’—means that he acquires the nature of Ākāśa.
‘*Mūrti*,’ ‘Figure,’ does not stand here for the *Body*; as Ākāśa has no
‘body’ at all.

“What is this ‘*Brahman*’ into whose form the man is said to become
merged?”

It is the Supreme Soul, of the nature of Bliss; He of whom all these
embodied souls are mere inodes, just as waves are of the ocean perturbed
by the force of wind. And just as when the ocean becomes calm, the waves
become merged into it, in the same manner the embodied souls become
transformed and merged into the Supreme Soul. All this is going to be
described in detail in Discourse 12.

What is enjoined in the present context is the mere reciting and study
of the *Gāyatrī* verse, not its *Japa*, repetition; this is shown by the
fact that the number of repetitions is not stated.

‘*Untired*’;—this denotes that the recitation is to be carried out again
and again; as a single recitation can never tire a person.

The ‘*monosyllable*’ is the syllable ‘*om*.’—It is the ‘*Supreme
Brahman*,’ in the sense that it is the means of reaching Brahman. This
assertion is based upon the fact that Brahman is attained by the
‘repeating,’ and ‘the meditation upon the signification,’ of the
syllable (as mentioned in *Yogasūtra* 1.28). ‘*Om*’ is a name of
Brahman; as says the *Yogasūtra* (1.23)—‘The Praṇava is expressive of
Him (God).’

“In comparison with what is this the *highest?*”

It is higher than all other forms of Brahman-meditation. The meditation
upon the syllable ‘*om*’ as Brahman is superior to all the several forms
of meditation mentioned in such texts as ‘One should meditate upon food
as Brahman’ (*Taittirīya Upaniṣad*, 2.2.1), ‘The teaching is that the
Sun is Brahman’ (*Chāndogya Upaniṣad*, 3.19.1); and this for the simple
reason that the attainment of Brahman has been described as proceeding
from the mere recitation of that syllable; and also because the word
itself has been described as ‘Brahman,’ in such passages as—‘One who is
well versed in Brahman in the form of Word attains the supreme Brahman.’
(*Maitry* *upaniṣad*, 6.22). Nothing is beyond the reach of words, and
of' all words the syllable ‘*om*’ is the very source: as says the
*Śruti*—‘Just as the needle pierces through all the leaves, so in the
same manner is all speech pierced by *om*, all this is *om* itself’
(*Chāndogya Upaniṣad*, 2.23.4). The ‘piercing’ spoken of in this passage
means ‘pervasion,’ ‘becoming the receptacle.’ “But in what manner is all
speech *pierced* by *om*?”

Well, as regards the *word* of the Veda, it has already been pointed out
(in verse 74) that its source lies in the syllable ‘*om*’ As regards the
words of secular speech, it has been declared by Āpastamba (1.4.13.9)
that ‘All sentences should be preceded by *om*.’

The above passage (from the Chāndogya) has been explained differently in
the *Upaniṣad-bhāṣya*; we are not reproducing that explanation here, as
it has no bearing on the present context.

The term ‘*breath-suspension*’ here stands for the act of suspending the
breath along with the entire procedure beginning with the sipping of
water.

‘*Highest austerity*—*i.e*., an austerity higher than the Cāndrāvaṇa and
the rest.

“What is the *superiority* here (meant by the epithet ‘*highest’)?*”

It is purely figurative.

‘*There is nothing higher than the Sāvitrī*’;—*i.e*., no other *mantra*.

In praise of all this we have the next expression—‘*Truth is better than
silence*’ ‘*Silence*’ is control of speech. And the result accruing from
the telling of truth is superior to that resulting from the control of
speech. Since the *telling of truth* implies the acting up to a positive
injunction, while in *silence* there is observance of the mere
prohibition of telling lies.

This verse is purely valedictory.—(83)

All acts laid down in the Veda—‘*oblations*’ in the form of *Agnihotra*
and the rest,—as also ‘*sacrifices*’ in the form of *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the
rest,—‘*pass away’; i.e*., either they never bring about their results
in their entirety, or even when brought about, those results perish
quickly.

‘*This syllable*’—‘*om*’—is to be known as ‘*imperishable*,’ *i.e*.,
bringing about imperishable results; since for one who has become merged
into Brahman, there is no return to worldly existence. Thus leading to
an imperishable result, the syllable is itself called ‘imperishable.’
One of the two terms ‘*akṣara*,’ one is a noun, which forms the subject
of the sentence, while the other, is the predicate, and is taken in its
literal sense.

That same syllable is also Brahman, and Prajāpati.

This also is purely valedictory.

The expression ‘*juhoti-yajati*’ mentions two verbal roots; and the term
‘*kriyā*’ stands for the actions of (oblation) and *Yāga* (sacrifice)—as
denoted by the two roots. The plural number is due to the multiplicity
of the acts. Or, the two verbal roots may be taken as standing for the
acts of *Homa* and *Yāga* themselves, while ' *kriyā*’ stands for the
other acts of charity and the like. The whole is a copulative
compound—made up of the three terms ‘*juhoti*,’ and ‘*kriyā*’—the acts
of *H* *oma* and *Yāga* being separately mentioned by reason of their
importance.

Some people have held that this praise of the syllable ‘*om*’ by itself
(as apart from the and the verse) is meant to enjoin the repetition of
the syllable; and they argue that this cannot be taken as merely
supplementary to the foregoing injunction of the reciting of the Sāvitrî
along with ‘*om*,’ etc., as no reference to this latter is made in the
present verse; as there is in the case of the sacrifice, in connection
with which we find two passages—(*a*) ‘*Yadaṣṭākapalo bhavati gāyat
chainam brahmavarchasena punāti*,’ and (*b*)
‘*Yannavakapalastṛvṝtaivāsmimstejo* *daḍhāii*,’—where reference is
distinctly made to a foregoing injunction; so that so long as it is
found possible (on the basis of this reference) to connect the
injunctions syntactically (and treat them as a single injunction), there
can be no justification for splitting them up into two distinct
injunctions. In the present instance, on the other hand, when it is said
that ‘*this should be regarded as imperishable*,’ there is no reference
to any thing that has gone before; nor is there any reference made to
the *Sāvitrī*, etc. Por these reasons, the present text is to be taken
as a self-contained injunction, and not as supplementary to something
else. Further, the verbal affix in ‘*jñeyaḥ*’ ‘(should be regarded)’ is
purely injunctive. And this, taken along with the word ‘*brahma*,’ gives
the sense that ‘this should he regarded—*i.e*., meditated upon—as
Brahman’; and this ‘*meditation*’ stands for the mental process of
repeating the syllable.—(84)

‘*Kṣaranti*’—‘Pass away—do not bring about their complete results, or
their results disappear quickly’—(Medhātithi, Govindarāja, Kullūka and
Nārāyaṇa);—‘Perish—as far as their form and results are
concerned’—(Nandana).

‘*Brahma*’—The neuter form is accepted by Medhātithi, Govindarāja,
Kullūka and Rāghavānanda. Nārāyaṇa and Nandana read the masculine form
‘*brahmā*’, and explain the phrase as ‘just like Brahmā, the Prajāpati.’

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Ācāra, p. 321), where it is
explained that—‘*akṣaram*’ stands for the *syllable* ‘*om*’,—and this is
‘akṣara’ in the sense that its effect in the form Final Release ‘never
perishes’ (*na-kṣarati*);—and that the syllable ‘*om*’ is to be regarded
as ‘Prajāpati’ on the ground of its being expressive of that deity. Here
again this same verse is attributed to Yama also.

Medhātithi’s remarks on p. 115,11. 1-8 are based upon Mīmāṃsā-Sūtra 1.
4. 17-22.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Paribhāṣā, p. 79), which reads
‘*Akṣaram śreṣṭham*’ for ‘*duṣkaram jñeyam*’ and explains it as
‘*Brahma-praṇava*.’

The ‘*enjoined offering*’ is that which forms the subject of
injunctions; such as *Jyotiṣṭoma* and the rest; such acts are called
‘enjoined offering,’ as they have been enjoined by words like ‘should
offer’ and the rest, and are performed by means of external acts, and
with the full accompaniment of priests and other innumerable details.

The *Japa*, ‘ Repeating of Mantras’ is not an ‘offering’; but with a
view to eulogise it, it has been spoken as an ‘offering’ only
figuratively; consequently this cannot be included under the term
‘enjoined offering.’

This latter ‘*excels*,’—is a better, superior, offering than the
*Jyotiṣṭoma* and the rest,—‘*ten times*’.

What is meant here is that the Repeating of Mantras is highly
efficacious; the meaning being that the results proceeding from the
Repetition are the same, but larger, as those proceeding from the
Ritualistic Offerings. It is not meant that the Repeating of Mantras
actually brings about results larger than those brought about by the
ritualistic sacrifices; for if it were really so, who ‘would ever
undertake the performance of the latter, which involve much physical
hardship and the expenditure of much wealth? For these reasons it is
clear that what is said here is a mere praise (of the Repeating of
Mantras); just like the assertion that ‘One attains all desirable ends
by the

Final Oblation.’ All that is meant is that from this act also the same
results follow, in the shape of Heaven and the rest; but the difference
iu the amount of human effort involved leads to the difference in the
degree of the result. And as the text does not specify any particular
result, it should be taken to mean that by the Repeating of Mantras one
obtains the same results—in the shape of heaven, landed property,
children and cattle—as those proceeding from sacrificial performances.

‘*The Inaudible, a hundred times*’—That repeating of Mantras is called
Inaudible which is not heard by any other person, however near he may
be.

‘*A thousand times—the Mental*.’—That in which the Mantra in meditated
upon by a mere mental operation.

The ‘Inaudible’ and other qualifications pertain to all kinds of
Repeating Mantras (and not only to the repeating of the *Gāyatrī*,
etc.); the continuity of the context, starting from verse 82, having
been broken. Hence, whenever there is repetition of Mantras—in the
course of either Expiatory Rites, or the rites performed for the
allaying of portents, or those intended to bring about prosperity,—the
said qualifications become applicable.

The term ‘*sāhasra*’ literally means *that which has a thousand*; and
since the noun spoken of is ‘*guṇa*,’ ‘times,’ ‘fold,’ the term means
‘thousand-fold’; the term ‘fold’ standing for *part*. That this refers
to the *excess of results* is clear from the connection of the entire
sentence.—(85)

The five ‘great sacrifices,’ leaving off the are what are meant by the
‘four cooked offerings.’

‘*Enjoined sacrifices*’—those already described (under the preceding
verse); along with these latter, the former (four) ‘are not worth the
sixteenth part’—*i.e*., are not equal to the sixteenth part.

Or, the root ‘*arha*’ may be taken in the sense of the price paid for
the obtaining of a certain thing. The root ‘*arha*’ with the
Present-Tense-ending ‘*tip*’ gives the form ‘*arhanti*.’—(86)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Pākayajñāḥ*’—This term stands for the last four of the five
‘*Mahāyajña*’—

1.  *Brahmayajña* (Vedic study),
2.  *Devayajña* (the Vaiśvadeva offerings),
3.  *Pitṛyajña* (daily Śrāddha offerings),
4.  *Bhūtayajña* (Bali offerings)
5.  and *Manuṣyayajña* (Feeding of guests),

according to Medhātithi, Kullūka, Nārāyaṇa and Nandana.

According to Govindarāja and Rāghvānanda, it stands for all *Śrauta* and
*Smārta* offerings.

The main classification of sacrifices is based upon the difference in
the substances offered. On this basis they have been classified as
under:—

\(l\) *Haviryajñas*, also called ‘Iṣti’, consisting in the offering of
such substances as milk, butter, rice, barley and other grains;—the
principal representatives of this class are (*a*) the *Darśapūrṇamāsa*,
which is described in detail in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (I and II); and
its six ectypes—(*b*) the *Agnyādhāna*, (*c*) the *Agnihotra* (*d*) the
*Āgrahāyaṇeṣṭi* (*e*) the *Cāturmāsya*, (*f*) the *Paśubandha* and (*g*)
the *Sautrāmaṇi*; all these are offered into fire specially consecrated
by the *Agnyādhāna* rite, which serving as it does only the purpose of
preparing the fire for other sacrifices, is not a *sacrifice* in the
strict sense of the term,—as has been remarked by Karka in his
commentary on Kātyāyana’s Śrautasūtra.

\(2\) *Pākayajñas* consisting of the offering of cooked substances, not
in the consecrated fire, but in the domestic fire and other receptacles.
The seven principal sacrifices included under this category are—the five
‘great sacrifices’ (described in *Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa* 10-5.7 and in
Manu, 3.70), the *Aṣṭakās*, the *Pārvaṇa* offerings, the *Śrāvaṇī*, the
*Āgrahāyaṇī*, the *Caitrī* and the *Āśvāyujī*. These are described in
the *Gṛhya*—not *Śrauta*—Sūtras. Though the substances offered in these
are not very different from those in the Iṣṭis on Haviryajñas, yet they
are classed separately, on the ground that the receptacle of the
offerings in their case is not the consecrated fire.

\(3\) *Somayajñas* in which the substance offered is the Soma-juice; it
includes the following seven sacrifices—(*a*) *Agniṣṭoma*, (*b*)
*Atyagniṣṭoma*, (*c*) *Ukthya*, (*d*) *Śoḍaśin* (*e*) *Vājapeya*, (*f*)
*Atirātra* and (*g*) *Āptoryamā*. Almost all *Somayajñas* involve the
killing of an animal, hence the Animal-sacrifices, Paśuyāgas, have been
included by older writers under this category; though later writers have
drawn a distinction between the *Somayāga* and the *Paśuyāga*. The very
elaborate sacrifices, such as the *Aśvamedha*, the *Rājasūya*, the
*Pauṇḍarīka* and the *Gosava* (according to Devala)—are generally
classed apart, under the generic name of *Mahāyajñakratu*’.

*By means of repeating Mantras alone the Brāhmaṇa succeeds*;—*i.e*.,
acquires all desirable results,and also attains Brahman.

No such doubt on this point should be entertained in the mind, as—“How
can one acquire, by means of Mantra-repetition alone, such results as
are obtained only by means of such elaborate acts as the *Jyotiṣṭoma*
and the rest, which cost much effort, or from deep and prolonged
meditations?”—Because as a matter of fact, such success does actually
follow.

‘*He may do anything else*.’—In the shape of the Jyotiṣṭoma and other
non-com pulsory acts, —‘*or* *not do it*.’—For ‘one comes to be called a
*Brahmaṇa if lie is of a friendly disposition*.’ ‘*Maitra*’ is the same
as ‘*mitra*.’ The Brahmaṇa should be friendly to all living beings; and
how can there be any *friendliness* (benevolence) in such acts as the
killing of animals during the *Agnīṣomīya* offerings?

This passage is purely valedictory; it is not a prohibition of the
killing of animals during sacrifices; because it is only supplementary
to what has gone before (and as such it cannot be taken as an
independent prohibition), and because such killing is directly enjoined
in the Veda itself.

*Thus ends the process of Repeating Mantras*.—(87)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

‘*Maitraḥ*’—‘of friendly disposition (towards all living
beings)’—Medhātithi;—‘worshipper of Mitra, Sun’ (suggested by
Rāghavāṇanda).

‘*Brāhmaṇaḥ*’—‘one who will be absorbed in Brahman’ (Kullūka);—‘the best
of Brāhmaṇas’ (Rāghavānanda);—

Buhler remarks—“Medhātithi and Govindarāja take the last clause
differently: it is declared (in the Veda that) a Brāhmaṇa (shall be) a
friend (of all creatures).” But in Medhātithi we find no mention of the
Veda here.

The verse is clearly meant to be deprecatory of Animal-sacrifices, which
involve the killing of animals, whereas the Brāhmaṇa should be friendly
to all creatures.

This verse is quoted in *Yatidharmasaṃgraha* (p. 127).
