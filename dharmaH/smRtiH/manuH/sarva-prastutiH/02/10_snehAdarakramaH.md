The subject taken up having been finished, rules regarding salutation
are next taken up.

‘*Laukika*,’ ‘*temporal* is that which, pertains to worldly affairs;
*i.e*., the teaching of popular usage and custom; or it may mean the
teaching of the arts of singing, dancing and playing upon musical
instruments; or, it may mean the knowledge of what is contained in works
dealing with the Arts, such as those of Vātsyāyana, Viśākhin and others.

‘*Vaidika*,’ ‘*scriptural*,’ is that which is expressed by Vedic
injunctions; that is the knowledge of the Veda, the Vedāṅgas and the
Smṛtis.

‘*Knowledge spiritual*’ stands for the esoteric science of the spirit or
soul; or figuratively, it may stand for that pertaining to the Body,
*i.e*., the science of medicine.

From whom one learns all this knowledge, such a teacher, he *should
salute first of all*; when one meets him for the first time (in the day)
he should invite his attention to himself, by means of words indicated
later on, for the purpose of obtaining from him words of blessing.

‘*First*,’—*I.e*., the pupil should address him first; he should not
wait for being addressed by the teacher; it is only in this way that he
would be a ‘saluter.’

*Objection*.—“If this is what is implied by the root *salute* itself,
the term ‘*first*’ becomes superfluous.”

Not so; it is only by virtue of the term ‘first’ that we deduce the said
meaning. If we took only the root and the prefix (in the verb)
‘*abhirādayet*’), we could only get the sense of *speaking*
(‘*vadanam*’) *in front* (‘*ābhimukhyena*’); and this *speaking in
front* is possible also when the speaker has been previously addressed
by another person.

Some people have explained the term ‘first’ to mean ‘before saluting
one’s parents.’ But this does not deserve consideration, as this
relative precedence bears no relation to the context.—(117)

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, (1.2,15).—‘He should never bear malice towards
him.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (5.19-20).—‘He should be always saluted; some
people hold that the Teacher’s feet should he clasped.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (14.7-9)—‘When one has completed his study he
should clasp the feet of all his superiors;—also when he meets them on
returning from a journey;—there should he clasping of the feet of
brothers and sisters, in the order of seniority.’

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (13.12).—‘The feet should be clasped of one who is
superior either in Vedic learning or in birth.’

*Viṣṇu-Smṛti* (27. 14-17).—‘Having offered the Twilight Prayers, he
should salute the Teacher:—he should touch his feet with reverent hands,
the right with the right and the left with the left;—at the salutation,
he should also announce his name, ending with the term *bhoḥ*.’

*Gobhila-Gṛhyasūtra* (3.1.27).—‘Wearing of the girdle, begging alms,
fetching fuel, water-sipping, morning-salutation,—these are obligatory
daily duties.’

*Śānkhyāyana-Gṛhyasūtra* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 460).—‘Daily, one
shall salute the Teacher, as also his elders—of these, the Vedic scholar
whenever one meets him; and one who is not learned in the Veda, only
when one meets him on returning from a journey.’

*Paiṭhīnasi* (Do.).—‘One should salute, first of all, that person from
whom one acquires knowledge, either temporal or scriptural or related to
Dharma.’

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

This verse is in praise of the rules regarding Salutation, etc.

He for whom the *Sāvitrī* is the sole essence, his all in all, is called
‘*Sāvitrīmātrasāraḥ*,’ ‘*knowing the Sāvitrī alone*.’

‘*Better*’—Superior;—‘*the* *Brāhmaṇa*,’ if he is thoroughly *self-*
*Controlled*, *i.e*., who governs himself entirely in accordance with
the scriptures.

One who is ‘*not sell-controlled*,’ ‘*though the three Vedas*’—fully
conversant with the scriptures.

‘*Eats all things*,’—things even though not actually prohibited, yet
against custom and usage.

Similarly ‘*sells all* *things*’—‘Selling’ is mentioned only by way of
illustration, it stands for all that is prohibited.

The meaning of all this is ns that one becomes as much open to censure
by omitting to rise to receive the teacher and other practices ns he is
by the omission of other rules of conduct.

*Objection*.—“How is it that wè have the form ‘*varam* (neuter) *vipraḥ*
(masculine)’; the correct form would be ‘*varo vipraḥ*’ (both
masculine).”

In answer to this some people say that the phrase opens with the general
and ends with the particular: the construction being—‘*It is
better*,’—“What is better?”—‘that the Brāhmaṇa be self-controlled.’

Others however explain that the term ‘*vara*’ has no particular gender
of its own; and it is used in the neuter gender also.—(118)

The copulative compound ‘*śayyāsane*’ is formed with the terms ‘*śayyā*’
and ‘*āsana*,’ the singular number being in accordance with Pāṇini
2.4.6, by which‘terms expressing in-animate genuses form copulative
compounds in the singular.’

‘*On a couch and seat*,’ ‘*one should not sit*’—along with—‘*a
superior*’;—*i.e*., one who is superior in learning, such as the teacher
and others.

In view of the question as to whether one should not sit with his
superior anywhere, the text has added the word ‘*adhyācarite*,’
‘*prepared*,’ *i.e*., made up, as the couch or a seat; so that there is
no harm in sitting upon a seat of stone or such other things.

This is only a re-iteration of what is going to be said under 204 below
that—‘One may sit with his teacher on slabs of stone, a boat.’

Others explain the term ‘*adhyācarite*’ to mean ‘*occupied*’; and
‘*should not* *sit*’ to mean that ‘he should not sit upon it even
afterwards.’ And (according to this explanation) the present prohibition
does not apply only to sitting along with the superior; as this
prohibition is already contained in 203; and so long as the present
verse can be taken as an independent injunction, it is not right to take
it as a mere re-iteration.

(In view of this last objection) some people point to a difference
(between what is said here and what comes later on in 203), based upon
usage. That couch or seat which is known to belong specifically to the
Teacher,—that whereupon he, as a rule, lies down and sits,—on that the
pupil should never sit, cither in the presence or absence of the
Teacher; while that couch or seat upon which the Teacher has slept or
sat, once by the way,—sitting upon that during the Teacher’s presence is
what is prohibited. And it is this latter that is meant by the term
‘*adhyāca*’ in the text; which does not mean actual *possession* of the
couch by the Teacher.

While one is seated upon a couch or seat, if the superior should happen
to come, he should rise to meet him and offer hi s salutation. What is
meant by the second line of the verse is that the pupil should descend
from this seat on the advent of the Teacher; the meaning being that
standing upon the bare ground he should entirely relinquish the couch or
seat. While as for superior persons other than the Teacher,—in their
case the rising to meet is done even while one remains (standing) upon
the seat.—(119)

‘*Constantly reveres elders*’—by talking agreeably, and also attends

‘*Accosting*’ here stands for that word by which the other person is
addressed, is made to answer, either with words of benediction, or with
an inquiry after welfare. ‘*After this accosting*’—*i.e*., after the
word expressing such accosting,—*i.e*., in immediate sequence to the
word, one should pronounce the following expression—‘*This here I named
so and so*.’ ‘*This so and so*,’ ‘*man*,’ is a pronoun standing for all
particular name-forms. The use of this expression is meant to attract
tho attention (of the person accosted); the sense being—‘you are being
greeted by me,’ *i.e*., ‘you are being invited to pronounce your
benediction’; and being thus addressed, the other person, having duly
comprehended the invitation and request, proceeds to answer the greeting
by means of words expressing benediction.

But the mere use of the generic pronoun ‘this’ would not provide the
idea that ‘you are being accosted by me who am named this’; and in that
case the other person would not fully comprehend the invitation, and
hence to whom would be address the words of benediction? For this
reason, it has been declared that ‘*he should pronounce his name*’; so
that where accosted with the words ‘I am named Devadatta,’ the person
fully comprehends the greeting.

*Objection*.—“There being no use for the word ‘*this*,’ we see no
purpose in its use.”

*Answer*.—Writers often make use of expressions borrowed from the usage
of other *Smṛtis*; for example, they use the term ‘*Dvitīyā*,’ in the
sense of the *Accusative*, in accordance with the usage laid down by
Pāṇini in his Sūtra 2.3.2. In regard to the present subject, we find it
formulated in the *Yajñasūtra* that ‘the mentioning of one’s own name is
to be done with the word *this*.’

*Objection*.—“In that case that the name should be pronounced having
been already expressed by the words ‘*he should pronounce his name*,’—it
is superfluous for the text to repeat the term ‘name,’ in the expression
‘*this I am named*’?”

That expression has been added for the purpose of securing the use of
the term ‘name’; the sense being that, one should pronounce his name
saying ‘I am *named* so and so’ (and not merely ‘I am so and so.’)

According to others, both expressions mean the same thing ‘this here I
am such and such a person’; so that the use of the one or the other
expression is optional.

According to this verse, the exact form of the words of greeting comes
to be this—‘*abhivādaye devadattanāma’ham* *bhoḥ*,’ ‘I accost thee, Sir,
I who am named Devadatta the use of the ‘Sir’ being prescribed in the
following verse (124).

‘*Elder*’—the addition of this word in the text is meant to imply that
there should be *accosting* of equals and inferiors also, but in their
case, the form is not as laid down here, which is meant for the case of
*elders* only.—(122)

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 25), where the following
notes are added:—‘*abhivādāt*,’ *i.e*., after the word ‘*ahhivādaye*,’
‘I salute’—one should mention his name, ‘I am so and so’;—the term
‘*vipra*’ stands for all the *twice-born* men;—also in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 45), which says that what is meant by ‘*abhivādāt*’ is ‘after having
pronounced the words ‘*I salute*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p.
96), which adds the explanation ‘one should pronounce his own name, *I
am Devadatta*, after having saluted.’

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450), where the following
explanation is added:—When saluting the elder—*i.e*., an aged
person—‘*abhivādātparam*’—*i.e*., after uttering the word
‘*abhivādaye*’, ‘I salute,’—one should utter his proper name, ‘I am so
and so.’ It has been declared in the *Yajñasūtra* that the generic
pronoun ‘*asau*’ (‘so and so’) indicates the proper name. Since the text
uses the term ‘elder,’ it follows that the method here laid down is not
to be employed in saluting such *uncles* and other superior relatives as
are younger in age to the saluter; the method for saluting them is going
to be described later on. The term ‘*Vipra*’ includes the *Kṣatriya* and
the rest also; as is clear from the rules regarding the returning of
salutation, under verse 127 below.

On the expression ‘*ahamasmi*,’ this work quotes Medhātithi’s remark
that both ‘*aham*’ and ‘*asmi*’ meaning the same thing, the use of the
one or the other is optional. But this has been quoted as the opinion of
‘others’ by Medhātithi. This view is rejected by Vīramitrodaya as being
repugnant to Manu, verse 122. It rejects the view of Kullūka also, who
opines that the term ‘*nāma*’ need not be used in the formula.

This verse is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 296) where too
the term ‘*abhivādātparam*’ is explained to mean—‘Having first uttered
the words *I salute*, he should pronounce his name’;—and in Aparārka (p.
52), which says that the formula is ‘*abhivādaye caitranāmāhamasmi
bhoḥ*.’;—and in *Aparārka* (p. 52), which *bìiivādaye caitranāmāhamasmi*

From what has come before it might be understood that even an unlearned
person deserves to be saluted, by reason of the large amount of wealth
he might possess; the present verse serves to preclude such a notion.

‘*Those who*,’ being uneducated;—‘*of the name*’—in its Sanskrit form
that may have been pronounced,—‘*the significance, as pronounced in the
words of greeting*’; persons, not conversant with grammar do not
understand the words to mean that ‘I have been accosted by this
person,’—they do not understand the Sanskrit language.—To such persons,
as also to women who deserve to be saluted,—these do not comprehend the
Sanskrit language—the wise one should say simply ‘I salute thee,’ thus
omitting only the mention of his name, which forms one part of the full
injunction. If the persons thus accosted should fail to understand even
this much, then they should be saluted even with corrupt vernacular
forms of words; it is in view of this that the text has added the
epithet ‘*wise*’; *i.e*., when one realises the difficulty of the other
person’s understanding, he should find out some such form of greeting as
might suit each particular case, and he should not stick to the precise
form enjoined in the preceding verse.

‘*Similarly to all women*’; the term ‘all’ implies that the same applies
even to the wives of teachers,—even though they be capable of
understanding Sanskrit words.

Some people have explained that one should pronounce his name only when
it so happens that he is known among people by a pseudonym—some such as
‘*Vanamālīvarṇaḥ*,’—so that the real name given to him by his father is
not known, and what is known is not his real name.

Others have explained the verse to refer to those who do not know the
correct form of answering the salutation; for instance, Pāṇini (8.2.83)
has laid down that the vowel at the end of the name pronounced in
answering a salutation should he pronounced ultra-long; and to those who
do not know this, the wise one should simply say ‘I.’ The author of the
*Mahābhāṣya* (Patañjali) also has said the same in course of his
explanation of the uses of the Science of Grammar—“Ignorant people who
do not know that in answering a salutation, the name should be
pronounced with an ultra-long vowel,—to such persons one may freely say
simply ‘I,’ just as to women.” These writers have said that the term
‘*abhivāda*,’ ‘salutation,’ in the present verse has got to be taken in
the sense of ‘answering a salutation,’ specially on account of what has
been said in other *Smṛtis*. If the present verse is not explained on
these lines, then, the prohibition of salutation, occurring in verse 126
below would come to be taken as prohibiting the saluting of all
unlearned persons; and this would be contrary to what other Smṛti-rules
have laid down regarding the use of the simple form ‘it is I’ (in the
saluting of unlearned persons). If, on the other hand, we adopt the
explanation as here suggested, then the said prohibition (occurring in
1.20) might be taken as purely commendatory, and not mandatory; and this
would be quite consistent with the present explanation.—(123)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vidhānapārijāta* (p. 501) as laying down the
method of salutation also in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 451), where
the following observations are made:—

‘In the case of such illiterate men as do not comprehend the salutation
addressed to them in the form of the Sanskrit sentence declaring the
name of the saluter,—*i. e*. who do not understand that they are being
saluted,—as also in the case of all women, literate and illiterate,—one
should not omit his own name, and say simply, ‘I salute you and if even
this much is not understood, then the salutation may be made even with
corrupt vernacular words;—such is the implication of the term
‘*prājña*,’ *wise*. The ancients have defined ‘*abhivādana* ‘salutation’
as *obeisance with the prescribed formula*.

There is a difference among—

1.  *Pādopasaṃgrahaṇa* (clasping the feet),
2.  ‘*Abhivādana*’ (salutation)
3.  and ‘*Namaskāra*’ (bowing);

—the (1) being reserved for Teachers and Elders, (2) for people very
much older than the saluter, and (3) for those only slightly older; so
says Harihara; and *Kalpataru* also mentions ‘*abhivādana*’ and
‘*Pādopasaṃgrahaṇa*’ separately; Manu himself mentions the two
separately in verse 216 below.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 54) as laying down that the
saluting of illiterate persons is to be done in the same form as that of
women;—also in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 98), which adds the
explanation:—‘To persons not conversant with the proper way of returning
the salute along with the name of the saluter,—as also to all women—the
salutation is to be offered only with the words ‘*aham bhoḥ*,’ ‘*it is*
*I*, *sir*!’

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (13.1.1).—‘*Here I am*—he should say only this much,
when saluting a person who is not learned enough to know the proper form
of returning the salutation.’

*Āpastamba* (Aparārka, p. 54).—‘Elderly ladies one shall salute with
bowing the head; all ladies are to be saluted with one’s name; not so
one’s mother or the wives of Elders—say some.’

‘*At the end of his own name one should pronounce the term Oh, Sir*.’The
epithet ‘*own*’ has been added with a view to precluding the possibility
of the name of the saluted person being understood to be meant.

The rest of the verse is purely valedictory.

The term should be pronounced, immediately after the letters of the
name, but after some, other letters also, such as the expression ‘I am’
(as laid down in verse, 122, above). The presence of the particle
‘*iti*’ (in verse 122, after ‘*ahamasmi*’) is meant to define the actual
form of the expression to be used; the sense being that such is the
actual form of the expression to be used; Further, if the expression
were wrongly used iu the form ‘Devadatta, Oh, Sir, I am,’ the
comprehension of its meaning (by the accosted person) would be delayed,
and this would still further delay the inviting of his attention; and
this would defeat the purpose of the salutation. And it may also happen
that when the expression used is one not amenable to simple
construction, the other party does not comprehend it at all.

‘*Form*’—the existence of very essence. Or, it may mean that it comes in
lieu of the name of the accosted person; *i.e*., comes in place of the
name; and the name of the accosted person is. not pronounced. The term
‘*bhāta*’ may mean either that which is accomplished by means of
existence, or that which is accomplished by means of an agent.

Or, we may read ‘*svarūpabhāve*,’ with the locative ending.

‘*The form, Oh, Sir*’;—*i.e*., the presence, the existence, of the
term‘Oh, Sir’—‘*is, the form of* *all* *names*.’ Just as one is
addressed by having his name uttered—‘Oh, Devadatta, listen to me,’
similarly the term *bhoḥ*’ (Oh, Sir)—which ends in the Vocative
case-ending—is used for the purposes of address; this has been so
declared by the sages.—(124)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 26) with the following
notes:—The term ‘*bhoḥ*’ is the ‘*marūpabhāva*’ of names; *i.e*. it
leads the name uttered to reach the person addressed; the sense being
that when addressed with the term ‘*bhoḥ*’, the person catches the
saluter’s name. The root in the term ‘*bhāva*’ denotes *reaching*. If we
read ‘*bhobhāvaḥ*’ this would mean ‘the *bhāva*, or presence, of the
term *bhoḥ*:

It is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450) where we have the
following notes:—At the end of the name pronounced in the salutation,
one should utter the term ‘*bhoḥ*’ for attracting the attention of the
person saluted; because it has been declared by the sages that the term
‘*bhoḥ*’ stands for the names of the persons addressed; so that, even
though the name of the saluted person be not uttered, the term ‘*bhoḥ*’
becomes the proper form of address. Thus then the formula for saluting
comes to be ‘*abhivādaye amukanāma ahamasmi bhoḥ*.’

This is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 191);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 45), which states the complete formula as ‘*Ābhivādaye Devadatto’ham
bho*’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 96).

On salutation having been done, the answering greeting should be made by
the Father to the accoster, with the words—‘Be long-lived, Oh Gentle
One.’ The particle ‘*iti*’ in the text is meant to show that the
preceding words constitute the formula. The use of such expressions also
as (*a*) ‘*āyuṣmān edhi*,’ ' Prosper O Long-lived One,’ (*b*)
‘*dīrghāyurbhūyāh*,’ ‘Be long-lived,’ (*c*) ‘*cirañjīva*,’ ‘Live
long’—is permitted by the usage of cultured men.

‘*The vowel* “a”’—which occurs at the end of the name of the person
whose salutation is answered—‘*should be pronounced ultra-long*.’ The
term ‘*pluta*,’ ‘ultra-long,’ stands for the vowel that is drawn out to
the length of three moras. The vowel ‘a’ is mentioned only by way of
illustration; it stands for ‘i’ and other vowels also. The ‘*end*’
spoken of in the text is in relation to the vowels only; so that in the
case of names ending in consonants also, the lengthening applies to the
vowel that happens to be the *last*, ‘at the end.’ The term
‘*pūrvākṣaraḥ*’ qualities the ‘vowel *a*,’ which is to be lengthened;
and ‘*akṣara*’ here stands for the *consonant*; and the compound means
‘that vowel of which the preceding syllable is a consonant’; *i.e*., the
vowel occurring along with the consonant. What is meant is that it is
the vowel ‘a’ already there tbat is to be lengthened, and not any such
vowel as might be added; that is, the vowel that is already present in
the name is to be lengthened out.

All this explanation is in accordance with the rules of the revered
Pāṇini; as in the matter of the use of words and their meaning, the
revered Pāṇini is more authoritative than Manu and other writers. And
Pāṇini has laid down (in 8.2.83) that ‘in answering tile greeting of a
non-śūdra, the *ṭi* should be ultra-long and the name ‘*ṭi*’ is given to
that syllable of which the last vowel forms the beginning (which in tho
present case is the ‘*a*,’ which is regarded as a part of itself and
hence ‘having the last vowel for its beginning’). No significance is
meant to be attached to the specification of the ‘*Brāhmaṇa*’ in the
present verse; as what is here prescribed is applicable to the
*Kṣatriya* and others also. The usage sanctioned by other Smṛtis is also
the same, and no separate rules are laid down for these other castes.

As an example we have such expressions as ‘Be long-lived, O Devaḍattā’;
and one containing a name ending in consonant,—‘Be long lived, O
Somaśarmān.’—(125)

Buhler adopts the reading ‘*pūrvākṣaraplutaḥ*’, which is given by
Nandana, and mentioned by Nārāyaṇa. The meaning, according to this, as
Buhler remarks, is that the name Devadatta should be pronounced as
‘Devadattā.’ Medhātithi and Kullūka adopt the reading ‘*pūrvākṣaraḥ
plutaḥ*,’ under which the meaning is that ‘the vowel *a*, which occurs
at the end of the consonant, should be pronounced ultra-long.’
“According to this interpretation,” says Buhler, “Manu’s rule agrees
with Āpastamba and Pāṇinī (8-2-88). Govindarāja and Rāghavānanda go far
off the mark.”

Several commentators note that ‘*vipraḥ*’ includes all the twice-born
persons.

*Medhātithi* (p. 182, 1. 4)—‘*Tatra pūrvasmin &c*.’—Kullūka’s expounding
of the compound is simpler—‘*pūrvam*’
*nāmagatam*—‘*akṣaram*’—*vyāñjanam—saṃśliṣṭam yasya sa pūrvākṣaraḥ*.’

*Ibid*, (p. 182, 1. 8)—‘*Bhagavān Paṇinīḥ*’—This refers to the sūtra
‘*acontyādi ṭi*’ which defines the ‘ṭi’ as ‘that which has for its
beginning the last among the vowels’; and the example given in
*Siddhāntakaumudī* under Sūtra 8.283 is, *Āyuṣmān bhava Devadattā*’;
from which it is clear that the name ‘ṭi’ is applicable to the vowel ‘a’
in ‘tta’ and it is ‘*tadādi*’—having for its beginning the last of the
vowels—in the sense that it ends in itself, it being regarded as its own
constituent part, according to *Śabdenduśekhara*, which has the
following note—

> nanu mārtaṇḍa ityatra mārtaśabdāntyāc takārākāraḥ sa
> ādiryasyetyanyapadārtho durlabha iti cenna \| ekasminneva
> samudāyatvāropeṇa tadavayavatvāropeṇa ca tadupapatteḥ \|\|

This verse is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 297), which adds
the following notes:—The compound ‘*pūrvākṣaraḥ*’ is to be expounded as
*pūrvara akṣaram yasya*; and the ‘*purvam akṣaram*’, ‘preceding
syllable,’ in a name is the consonant, since a vowel can not be
‘preceded’ by another vowel; hence the meaning comes to be that the
vowel at the end of the final consonant should be pronounced ultra-long.
The term ‘*akṣaraḥ*’ stands for all vowels that may occur at the end of
a name \[This is exactly what Medhātithi and Kullūka have said\]; the
text could not have meant the vowel ‘a’ only; as it is not possible for
all names to end in that vowel. Thus the formula comes to be—‘*āyuṣmān
bhava saumya Devadattā*.’

It is quoted in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 26), which supplies three different
explanations:—At the end of the words ‘*āyuṣmān bhava saumya*,’ the name
of the saluter should be pronounced—‘*Viṣṇuśarman*’; (*a*) at the end of
the name an ‘a’ should be pronounced, and of this ‘a,’ the
‘*pūrvasvaraḥ*,’ the preceding syllable,’.should be ultra-long. The
masculine form ‘*akṣaraḥ*’ is a Vedic archaism, \[ the right form being
‘*akṣaram*’\]. Though the syllable ‘preceding’ (the ‘a’ pronounced after
the name ‘*Viṣṇuśarman*’) would be ‘n,’ yet inasmuch as the consonant
could not be pronounced ‘ultra-long,’ the term ‘preceding syllable’
would apply in this case to ‘a’ that is contained in the name \[ *i.e*.
the ‘a’ after ‘m’\]; and it is this ‘a’ that would be pronounced
ultra-long \[The formula thus being ‘*āyuṣmān bhava saumya
Viṣṇuśarmā3n*’\].—(&) ‘*Pūrvākṣaram plutam*’ is another reading, in
which case the construction is all light \[and there is no archaism\];
the meaning being that ‘the preceding syllable is to be pronounced
ultra-long.’—(*c*) Or, the sentence ‘*akāraśchāsya nāmno’nte*’ may be
explained as follows:—The vowel ‘a’ (*ākāraḥ*) that appears at the end
of ‘his’ (‘asya’, the saluter’s) ‘name’ (‘*nāmnaḥ*’)—‘a’ mentioned only
by way of illustration, any vowel at the end of the name being meant,—is
what is qualified by the qualifying word ‘*pūrvākṣaraḥ*’—which means, in
this case,—*that which has the syllables, akṣaram, in the name*
‘*preceding*’—‘*pūrvāṇi*,’—*itself*; and such a vowel should be
pronounced ultra-long,—and no other ‘a’, either in the name itself, or
added after the name.

The formula, according to all these explanations, is ‘*āyuṣmān bhava
saumya Devadattā3*.’ This is not accepted by *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra
p. 452), which would omit the word ‘*saumya*,’ which in Manu’s text, it
takes as standing for the name of the saluter; so that the formula
according to it would be ‘*āyuṣmān bhava Devadattā3*.’ It argues that if
we don’t take the word ‘*saumya*’ as standing for the name, we would
have to seek elsewhere for the injunction for *pronouncing the name* in
regard to which the second half prescribes the ultra-elongation of the
final ‘a.’—As regards the second line of the verse, it takes it to mean
that, ‘the *a* tliat appears at the end of the saluter’s name should be
pronounced ultra-long;—and adds that the vowel ‘*a*’ here stands for
vowels in general; as all names do not, and cannot end in ‘*a*’, in the
case of names ending in consonants also, fhe syllable to be
ultra-elongated would be the *last of the vmvels* contained in the name;
it is clear from Pāṇini’s rule that the ‘*ṭi*’ syllable is to be so
pronounced (see *note*, above)—and it is the last *vowel* that is called
‘*ṭi*’.—In the compound *pūrvākṣaraḥ* ‘*akṣara*’ means *consonant*, and
the compound means ‘that which has a consonant immediately preceding
it’; so that the text comes to mean that ‘the vowel that has a consonant
immediately preceding it should *not* be separated from the consonant
and then pronounced ultra-long; it should be pronounced along with the
consonant.’ It concludes that this explanation is in agreement with
Medhātithi and several others. According to this view the formulas would
be—(*a*) ‘*āyuṣmān bhava Devadattā3*’ (where the name ends in a vowel)
and (*b*) ‘*āyuṣmān bhava Somaśarmā3n*,’ where the name ends in a
consonant.

The same work goes on to add that Haradatta has adopted the reading
‘*pūrvākṣaraplutaḥ*’ (see note above) and has explained the verse as
follows:—At the end of the name is to be pronounced an additional
‘*a*’—over and above the syllables in the name itself,—and this
additional ‘*a*’—is to be ‘*pūrvākṣaraplutaḥ*,’—*i. e*., ‘having its
preceding syllable—*i. e., vowel*—ultra-long’;—*i. e*., the vowel
preceding the additional ‘*a*’ should be ultra-long; and this may be
done also where consonants may be intervening between the two. Thus in
the case of there being no intervening consonant, the formula would be
*āyuṣmān bhava saumya Devadattā3*,’ while in that of there being an
intervening consonant, it would be *āyuṣmān bhava saumya Agnichi3da*’
(where the consnant, ‘*d*’ intervenes between the additional ‘*a*’ at
the end, and the vowel ‘*i*’ preceding it.)

It further adds that the term ‘*vipraḥ*’ includes the *Kṣatriya* and
others also, as is clear from the fact that in grammar we find rules
(*a*) making the ultra-elongation of the final vowel *optional* in the
case of the saluter being a *Kṣatriya* or a *Vaiśya*, and also (*b*)
prohibiting the elongation in the case of the saluter being a *woman* or
a *Śūdra*.

This work quotes Medhātithi to the effect that the words in the text
‘*āyuṣmān bhava saumya*’ are meant to be purely illustrative, and it is
not meant that these should be the very words used; it is thus that even
such returns become permissible as—‘*āyuṣmānedhi*,’ ‘*dīrghāyurbhūyāḥ*,’
‘*cirañjīva*’ and others that are in common use among cultured people.

This verse is quoted also in *Nirṇayasindhu* (p. 191), where
‘*pūrvākṣaraḥ*’ is explained as referring to the letter preceding the
‘n’ in ‘*śarman*’;—and in *Aparārka* (p, 53), which adds the following
note:—The ‘*akāra*’ here stands for the final vowel in the name of the
saluter; hence whichever. vowel occurs at the end of the name should be
pronounced ultra-long; hence ‘*pūrvākṣaraḥ*’ means ‘that which is
preceded by a syllable’; this syllable preceding the final vowel must be
a consonant. Hence the meaning is that the vowel, along with the
consonant, should be pronounced ultra-long. It does not mean that an
additional ‘a’ is to be added at the end of the name.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 98), which adds the
following notes:—The vowel ‘*a*’ here stands for any vowel that occurs
at the end of a name; there is no such rule as that every name must end
in ‘a’; hence the elongation pertains to the vowel that occurs at the
end of a name; and it does not mean that an additional ‘*a*’ has to be
added at the end of every name.

It is quoted also in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 46), which has the same
remarks regarding the vowel ‘*a*’; it adds:—According to some people,
the title ‘*śarman*’ also has to be pronounced; so that the formula
would be ‘*āyuṣmān bhava Devadattā śarman*.’ Others hold that the
elongation prescribed is to be done to the ‘a’ contained in the term
‘*śarman*’ But this is open to doubt, as the term ‘*śarman*’ does not
form part of the *name*; if it did, then, as some other syllables would
necessarily be required to be prefixed to this, it could not be possible
to have any name ‘with two letters’, as has been prescribed. This
elongation of the vowel is not done in the name of the *Śūdra*, who is
excluded, according to Pāṇini’s Sūtra ‘*Pratyabhivāde’śūdre*’; this
however makes it clear that the salutation of the *Śūdra* also is to be
returned.

*Objection*.—“It would have sufficed to say ‘he who knows not the
return-greeting’; the addition of the phrase ‘of the greeting of
salutation’ is superfluous and not quite compatible.”

It is not so; the construction is—‘the return-greeting *in keeping with
the* greeting of salutation.’ For instance, propriety demands that (*a*)
if the salutation has been offered with the name of the accoster duly
pronounced, then in the return-greeting, the final vowel of the name
Should be pronounced ultra-long; (*b*) and he who salutes with the form
‘It is I, Oh, Sir,’ is to be answered without his name being uttered and
without the elongation of any vowel.

‘*Does not deserve to be saluted*’;—this prohibits the uttering of the
words of greeting; the sense being that ‘salutation may be offered,’ but
not with the words ‘it is I, Sir,’—the circumstances under which these
words are to be used h aving been shown before (under 123).

‘*As the Śūdra*,’—this appears to be by way of illustration; for as a
matter of fact the Śūdra also, when of great age, is held to be
deserving of salutation.

‘*By the learned*’;—this has been added only for the purpose of filling
up the metre.—(126)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450), where the
following explanation is added:—The meaning is that the man who does not
know the return greeting in strict consonance with rules of salutation
does not deserve to be greeted at all, the correct form of the response
being as laid down in the preceding verse—the ultra-elongation of the
vowel at the end of the name pronounced by the saluter in the formula of
salutation. What is prohibited here is only that salutation which is
accompanied by the formula containing the saluter’s name; that all
salutation is not entirely interdicted is indicated by the words ‘he is
exactly as the Śūdra is’;—the Śūdra also, when over ninety years of age,
is deserving of salutation, according to Manu 2. 137. The word
‘*pratyabhivādanam*’ means the pronouncing, by the elder who has been
saluted, of benediction with prescribed formula.

This verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 28), which adds a
verse from Yama to the effect that the Brāhmaṇa who, on being saluted,
does not return the proper benediction, is born as a tree in the
crematorium, inhabited by crows and vultures.

It is quoted in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 297) as laying down that no
salutation should be offered to one ignorant of the proper form of the
response to it;—in *Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 407);—in *Saṃskāramayūkha*
(p. 57);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 98).

*Yama* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 465).—‘On being saluted, if one does
not offer his blessing, a part of the saluter’s sins falls upon the
person saluted. To the Brāhmaṇa he should say *svasti* (all may be
well), to the Kṣatriya *āyuṣyam* (long-life), to the Vaiśya *vardhatām*
(may you prosper), to the Śūdra *ārogyam* (freedom from disease).’

\[Yama also reproduces Manu’s Verse.\]

When a greeting has been offered and answered, and friendly relations
have thereby become established, occasion arises for enquiry; and the
present verse lays down the verbal forms whose diversity is based upon
distinctions of caste; and the caste-distinction pertains to the persons
questioned, not to the questioner. And, in as much as there is not very
much of a difference in the meaning of the words laid down, the
restriction is with reference to the verbal forms only. For instance,
the terms ‘*anāmaya*,’ ‘freedom from distemper,’ and ‘*ārogya*,’
‘freedom from disease,’ mean the same thing; nor is there much
difference in the meanings of the terms ‘*kuśala*,’ ‘welfare’ and
‘*kṣema*,’ ‘prosperity.’ Though the term ‘*kuśala*’ denotes
*erpertness*, yet it is also used in the sense of the *non-deficiency of
the body* and other things related to it.

The words here laid down must be used; but this does not mean that the
man should not make use of other words also, if he wishes to make
detailed enquiries; as has been clearly shown somewhere in the

On the strength of the expression ‘*having*,’ some people explain this
verse to mean tbat the questions are to be put only to persons of equal
age, and they do not apply to the case of the teacher and other
superiors; for the teacher has to be ‘*approached*,’ not ‘*met*.’

But, as a matter of fact, there is ‘meeting’ in ‘approaching’ also; so
there is no force in the said explanation.—(127)

According to Govindarāja, the rule refers to friends or relatives
meeting, not to every one who returns a salute.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 450) in support of
the view that the term ‘*vipraḥ*’ in verse 125 includes the Kṣatriya,
the Vaiśya and the Śūdra also; as it lays down the return-greeting for
all these;—and again on page 465, as a verse common to Manu and Yama and
laying down the benedictory response to salutation.

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 298) as laying down
the return-greetings appropriate for the several castes;—in
*Nityāchārapradīpa* (p. 406) as laying down what should be said after
salutation has been returned;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 47);—and in

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

At the time of answering a greeting, as also on other occasions, one who
has been ‘*initiated*,’—that is, during the time beginning from the
performance of *Dīkṣaṇīyā Īṣṭi* and ending with the Final Bath—should
not be addressed by name; *i.e*., his name should not he uttered.

‘*Younger*’—born not very long ago.

The term ‘*api*’ ‘even,’ leads us to infer that of the elder person one
should not utter the name, even though he he n *ot initiated*. Says
Gautama (2.23)—‘The name and gotra of one’s superior should bo uttered
with *māna*, reverence’;—‘*māna*’ here stands for *reverence*’, and the
meaning is that the name should he uttered with reverence; *e.g*., in
some such form as ‘the highly revered lord, Janārdana Miśra.’

*Question*—“How then is one to converse with an initiated person, on
matters of business?”

It should begin with such terms as ‘sir’ and ‘your worship.’ That is,
ono should address the initiated person, after having pronounced the
word ‘Sir,’ and then by such names as ‘Initiate’ (), ‘sacrificer’
(‘*yajamāna*’) and the like, which are applicable to him in their
denotative sense. It does not mean that after having pronounced the term
‘sir,’ he should be addressed by name.

The passage being construed as—‘the address which is preceded by the
terms *sir* and *your worship*,’—in view of the fact that it is not
possible to use both the terms in the same sentence, people have laid
down the following rule—(*a*) when one is conversing with him directly,
then he should be addressed with the term *sir, Bhoḥ*, which contains a
vocative ending; (*b*)and when his qualities are being described to some
one else, then one should use such words as ‘such and such a thing has
been done by his worship the Initiate,’ ‘his worship does so and so.’
The text mentions only the basic from ‘*bhavat*’ (‘your worship’), and
it is to be used with such case-endings as may fit in with the sentence
in which it is contained.—(128)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 466), where the
following explanation is added:—At the time of returning the salutation,
the person initiated for a sacrifice even though he be younger in age,
should not be addressed by name, after the performance of the *Dīkṣaṇīyā
Iṣṭi*, the Initiatory Sacrifice, till the completion of the Final Bath
of the *Avabhṛtha*; he should be addressed by such words as ‘*Dīkṣita*’
and the like, following after the syllable ‘*bhoḥ*’ or ‘*bhavat*—*i. e*.
‘*bho dīkṣita*’.

It is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 28) in support of the view
that even in the return greeting, the name of the initiate should not be
pronounced; and is explained to mean that the initiate should be
addressed with such words as ‘*bho dīkṣita* or ‘*bhavān dīkṣita*, or
some such other expressions containing a synonym of the word
‘*dīkṣita*’.

When conversation is held with a female in connection with some
business, then one should do as directed in this verse.

She who is the wife of another person should be addressed either as
‘blessed lady,’ or as ‘lady, my sister.’ The term ‘*bhavati*’ ending in
the short vowel is derived from the base ‘*bhavat*’ with the feminine
affix, and with the vocative Case-ending. The particle ‘*iṭi*’ after
‘*bhavati*’ indicates that it is used in addition to the terms ‘blessed’
and ‘sister.’

‘*One should address*’;—this conclusively proves that the terms in
question arc meant to he used in their verbal forms.

If the lady happens to he an elderly one, she should he addressed as
‘mother,’ ‘glorious one’ and so forth; and if she is younger in age, she
is to be addressed as ‘daughter,’ ‘long-lived one,’ and so forth.

The presence of the term ‘wife’ shows that the form laid down is not to
be used in connection with unmarried girls.

‘*Who is not related to one by birth*,’—one who, like the daughter of
the maternal uncle, has not become a ‘relative’ either from the father’s
or the mother’s side. Special rules regarding these are going to be laid
down below (under 132).

*Objection*.—“In that case this latter verse would suffice to signify
that the present rule does not apply to relatives; and the general rule
here laid down would he applicable to other cases; under the
circumstances, where is the use of adding the clause ‘who is not
related, etc.’?”

*Answer*.—This being a metrical treatise, we should not be very
particular about superfluous repetitions.—(129)

The plural number in the word ‘superiors’ indicates that this word does
not stand for those superior persons that are mentioned in the present
verse; it is meant to be a generic name, standing for persons superior
in the point of wealth, etc., as mentioned by Gautama (in 6.20).

These when they are ‘younger’—whose age is lower than that of the
nephew, etc.

‘*Here l am*’—indicates the name of the accoster; the term ‘I’ being
meant to come after the name.

When the said persons have arrived, one should rise to meet them and
accost them in the manner here prescribed. The present direction
prohibits the use of the vocative term ‘*bhoḥ*,’ ‘sir,’ in the greeting.
Gautama also has said—‘There should be rising to meet; these are not to
be saluted.’ (6.9).—(130)

The equality of these to the Teacher’s wife haviug been already

The present text serves to indicate the propriety of behaving, as
towards one’s mother, towards the sister of his father, and the sister
of his mother, and also towards bis own elder sister.

*Objection*.—“The treatment to be accorded towards the father’s and the
mother’s sister has already been prescribed under 131 above. It might be
argued that in verse 131 it is said that they should be treated like the
*Teacher’s wife*, while in the present verse they are described as to be
treated like one’s *mother*. But this makes no difference; as the
behaviour towards the mother is precisely the same as that towards the
Teacher’s wife.”

To this some people make the following answer: The venerable character
of the father’s and the mother’s sister has been re-asserted only for
the purpose of adding that ‘*the mother is more venerable than these*.’
The meaning is that when one’s mother directs him one way, and the
father’s sister and the rest another way, he should act according to the
directions of his mother, and not according to those of the others. It
will not be right to argue that this (superiority of the mother) is also
already declared under verse 145; because this latter verse is purely
valedictory.

Others however hold that, there is some difference in the treatment to
be accorded to the mother and to the Teacher’s wife. In the case of the
Teacher’s wife, worship, etc., are necessary; while in the case of the
mother, it is often otherwise also, because of the son being too young,
or because of the mother being too fond of him. And since the father’s
sister and the mother’s sister also fondle the child (like his mother),
it is only natural that these should be treated like the mother.
Fondling during childhood is done by one’s own older sister also. But
when one has passed beyond childhood, his treatment of these relatives
should be like that of his teacher’s wife. All this is not got out of
the present verse only. And if we did not have both declarations (one in
the present verse, and Another in 131), then the mere assertion of
‘behaviour as towards his mother’ would be liable to be understood as
referring to salutation only, as it is this that forms the
subject-matter of the context; while as a matter of fact, it is the
*loving behaviour* that is here intended to be accorded.—(133)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

It has been said above (under 120) that ‘the life-breaths of the younger
men rush outwards at the approach of the elder now the present verse
proceeds to determine by bow many years one may be regarded as an
‘elder’; among ordinary men people come to be regarded as ‘elderly’ when
they become grey-headed.

Among citizens, equality and friendship are regarded as subsisting among
people who differ in their age by ten years, so that among these, one
conies to be regarded as ‘elder’ when he happens to be more than ten
years older; and those less than that should be treated as ‘friends and
equals’; and hence accosted as ‘Oh, Sir,’ as declared by Gautama
(6.14)—“Equals in age should be accosted as ‘Oh, Sir’; when the
difference in age is more than ten years, the person should be regarded
as ‘elder.’

In the expression ‘*daśābdākhya*,’ ‘*ākhyā*’ stands for ‘*ākhyānam*,’
‘*description*’; and the compound, a three-termed *Bahuvrīhi*, means
‘that whose description is ten years’; the years being construed as
qualifying ‘friendship’ on the basis of ‘description,’ and no
significance being attached to the difference between cause and effect
(the ‘years’ being the cause of the ‘friendship’), all that the compound
means is that—‘one who is senior by about ten years is an equal friend.’

‘*Pauras*,’ ‘*citizens*,’ are ‘persons living in cities.’ The mention of
‘cities’ is only by way of illustration; the same rule holds good among
inhabitants of villages also. Among people living in the same village,
all those come to be regarded as ‘friends’ among whom there happens to
be some ground for close intimacy.

Those persons who practise some sort of *art*—crafts, music and the
rest,—among these one who is older by less than five years is an
‘equal’; beyond that, he is ‘elder.’

‘*Tryabdam*’ means ‘that which is preceded by three years’; and of this
kind is the ‘equality’ among learned men.

‘*Among blood-relations, it ranges within a very short period of
time*’;—*i.e*., among persons belonging to the same family, he who is
senior by only a few days is also ‘elder.’

“What period of time is to be regarded as *very short*?”

It cannot he *three years*; for having spoken of three ‘*years*,’ the
text mentions ‘short,’ which means that it must be less than that. It
cannot mean *two* years, because of the singular number. Nor lastly, can
it mean *one* year, as in that case there would be no point in the
qualification ‘*very short*.’ Because ‘year’ is the name given to a
well-defined period of time; so that a period of time which is less than
that even by a single day ceases to be a ‘year.’ For these reasons
‘*short*’ must refer to time in general (unspecified), the only
peculiarity being tbat it, should be less than a year.

The particle ‘*ca*’ should be taken as standing for ‘*?va*,’ ‘*only*’;
the meaning being ‘*friendship* ranges only within a very short period
of time, beyond that the man becomes *elder*.’ All this should be taken
as holding good only among people of the same caste, possessed of
similar qualifications; so that the definition of ‘elder’ as something
relative in sense is that obtaining among ordinary people.

Other persons explain the verso as follows:—This verse does not define
what is tho characteristic of being ‘elder’; it only serves to define
‘Friendship.’ It could be taken as defining ‘elderliness’ only if we
abandoned its direct meaning; as only then could it be taken to mean
that ‘during such time one is a friend, and after that he becomes an
*elder*.’ As a matter of fact, what the verse means is as follows:—(*a*)
People who live in the same city for ten years become ‘friends’; (*b*)
among people knowing the arts—sixty-four in number—companionship during
five years establishes ‘friendship’; (*c*) among blood-relations,
friendship is established by living together even for a very short time.
Thus then, one does not become a ‘friend’ simply because he happens to
be of equal age, in fact the ‘friend’ is as described; but the said
conditions of ‘friendship’ all require tbat the parties concerned be of
equal age.

All this may be true; but this explanation is inconsistent with the next
verse; in the latter, ‘caste’ is mentioned as the pre-eminent factor,
and not the age; and the reason is that if the mere fact of being so
many years older in age were to make one ‘elder,’ then we could not get
rid of the contingency of persons of different (and inferior) castes
being regarded as ‘elders.’

Older commentators have all adopted the first explanation (put forward
by us).—(134)
</details>
<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

“Those who are ‘friends’ and equals may address each other with the
words ‘*bhoḥ*’, ‘*bhavat*,’ or ‘*vayasya*’, ‘friend’. The explanation of
the verse, which is substantially the same in all the commentaries, is
based on Gautama’s passage (6.14-17); while Haradatta’s interpretation
of Āpastamba (1.4.13) somewhat differs.”—(Buhler).

“A small difference in age constitutes among relatives a difference in
position; but in other cases only a considerable difference as
specified.—This ‘equality’ refers to the form of salutation among
equals.”—(Burnell—Hopkins).

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 466), where the
following explanation is given:—Among persons living in the same city,
and not possessed of any exceptional learning or wealth or other
qualifications, if the difference in the age of two persons extends to
within ten years, they are to treat each other as ‘friends,’ and there
is to be no salutation; the ‘city’ here includes the village also;—among
persons versed in music and other arts, equality extends to within five
years of difference in age;—and among those learned in the Veda to
within *one* (as read here) year;—and among *Sapiṇḍas*, to within a very
short period of time. In every case there is ‘superority’ if the
difference exceeds the periods mentioned.

It is quoted also in *Parāśaramādhava* (Ācāra, p. 299), where also we
have the following explanation Among inhabitants of the same village one
is to be treated as ‘friend’ if he is older by less than ten years;
beyond that he is to be treated as ‘superior’.—Among men expert in the
arts and in learning, there is equality if there is a difference of five
years;—among persons learned in the Veda, or students of the Veda, there
is equality if there is a difference of *three* years, after which the
older man becomes ‘superior’;—among blood relations, brothers and the
rest, the older person is to be treated as an equal only when the
difference in age is very small.

*Parāśaramādhava* raises the question of saluting such *Ṛtvik* and
others as are younger in age. In view of the general rule that these
should be saluted, the fact of any one being younger in age does not
deprive him of his right to a salute. The conclusion however is that all
that is meant is that they have to be ‘treated with respect’; and this
implies that one should stand up to receive and welcome them with
agreeable words, as is clearly laid down by Baudhāyana, who says,

> ṛtvikśvaśurapitṛ?yamātulānāṃ tu yaviyasāṃ pratyutthānābhibhāṣaṇam.

That these are not to he saluted is clearly asserted by Gautama (6.9),
which lays down that these are anabhivāthāḥ (?), It is interesting to
note that in quoting Gautama, Mādhava has read *abhivādanam* in place of
*anabhivādyāḥ*; but knowing somehow that the meaning of Gautama was that
these are *not* *abhivādyāḥ*, he has explained *abhivādanam* as
*abhibhāṣaṇam*, *speech*.

The verse is quoted also in *Madanapārijāta* (p. 29) as declaring the
difference in age which constitutes ‘superiority’. It practically
repeats the explanation given in *Parāśaramādhava* (see above); but at
the end adds that among blood-relations, the difference of even one day
establishes superiority; while between relations born on the same day
there is equality as declared by Āpastamba.—‘One born on the same day is
a *friend*.’

*Aparārka* (p. 53) quotes this verse and adds the following
explanation:—Among citizens even one who is ten years older is a ‘friend
and it is only one who is more than ten years older is to be regarded as
an ‘elder’; among musicians and other artists one older by five years or
less is a ‘friend’, older than that he becomes an ‘elder’; among Vedic
scholars, it is upto three years; and among these latter, superority or
inferiority is determined by special qualifications.—-The particle
‘*api*’ means ‘*eva*’.

It is quoted in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 101), which offers the
following explanation:—Among citizens, one who is senior by one to ten
years is to be regarded as a ‘friend’—an equal; one older than that is
an ‘elder’—a superior;—among artists people versed in singing, dancing
and so forth there is ‘friendship’ upto a difference of five years;
among Vedic scholars it extends to a difference of three years; older
than that, is ‘elder’—superior; among blood-relations there is
‘friendship’ within a limit of very few years; one even a little older
is to be saluted like an ‘elder’;—all this refers to Brāhmaṇas.

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra* (1.24.13).—‘Friendship (equality) among citizens
extends up to ten years; among members of the same Vedic sect, up to
five years and the elder Vedic scholar deserves salutation if he is
senior by three years.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (6.2.5).—‘One born on the same day as oneself is
his *friend*; a citizen who is senior by ten years; an artisan, who is

One since whose birth ten years have elapsed is ‘of ten years.’ The
*time* is the *determining* and the *Brāhmaṇa* the *determined* factor;
but it is not possible to determine, by means of *time*, either his
tallness or shortness or thinness, etc.; what can be determined by it is
only a certain act of his; and this act can only be that of *maintaining
his life-breath*, which subsists in him continuously since his birth.

The same explanation applies to the epithet ‘*of a* *hundred years*.’

They should be looked upon as ‘father and son.’

‘*Of the two*’—as compared with each other,—’ *the Brāhmaṇa is the
father*.’

All that this means is that even when the Kṣatriya is very old and the
Brāhmaṇa very young in years, the former should rise to meet and salute
the latter.—(135)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-भाष्यानुवादः</summary>

Caste has been described as a ground of superiority; so that one
belonging to a higher caste should be respected by one of a lower caste.
The text now proceeds to describe the relative strength of those factors
that entitle persons of a caste to salutation and honour among
themselves.

*Age* is mentioned here again only for the purpose of indicating its
position as compared with others.

In the case of all that is mentioned here it is the connection of the
person with them that entitles him to respect. That is, *the possession
of wealth* and the *possession of relations* constitute titles of
respect. It is not meant that the peculiar relationship borne by the
man—such as that of being a paternal or a maternal uncle—constitutes the
title of respect; what is meant is that one who has many relations
deserves to be respected.

‘*Age*’—*i.e*., advanced age. The term is generally used in this
qualified sense ; *e. g*., in such passages as—‘Even though the son be
of age, he should be advised by his father.’ Verse 134 has already
explained what age entitles one to respect

‘*Action*’—such as is laid down in *Śrutis* and *Smṛtis*; *i. e*., one’s
assiduity in performing such actions.

‘*Learning*,’—the knowledge of the Veda along with the subsidiary
sciences and their auxiliaries.

*Objection*.—“In view of such declarations as ‘the learned man offers
sacrifices,’ ‘the learned man officiates at sacrifices,’ the unlearned
person can never be entitled to the performance of religious acts; under
the circumstances, how can mere ‘action,’ without ‘learning,’ be a
ground for respect?”

*Answer*.—There is no force in this objection. *Excellence* is what is
meant here. Superior or efficient learning is what constitutes a title
to respect; and as for the performance of actions, this can be done also
by men possessed of limited learning; for a man is entitled to perform
actions in accordance with the knowledge possessed by him: specially as
‘*learning*’ entitles a person to the performance of actions simply
because it serves to capacitate him for it, and not because it has been
declared to be a necessary condition.

“But the man devoid of learning cannot know the form of the action to be
performed, and being capable of acting only like lower animals, to the
performance of what could he be entitled?”

Even such a person can, on having heard a few Smṛti-texts, perform
austerities and repeat *mantras*. It is only in the performance of the
Agnihotra and such other Vedic rites that one requires the knowledge of
Vedic texts. But here also the title to perform the rites is dependent
upon the extent of knowledge possessed by the man; *e.g*., one who knows
the meaning of tho texts bearing upon the *Agnihotra* is entitled to its
performance; the knowledge of other sacrifices is of no use in that.

The following argument might be urged here—“We have the injunction ‘the
entire Veda should be studied,’ which pertains to the whole Veda, and
implies the thorough understanding of the whole; and when it is
necessary to understand the meaning of the entire Veda, how can there be
any such partial knowledge as could justify such an assertion as that
‘he who knows the meaning of the texts bearing on the Agnihotra shall be
entitled to the performance of that act, even though he be ignorant of
the meaning of other texts?’”

Our answer to the above is as follows:—It is the study of one Vedic
Recension that is necessary; and what we mean is that he who has studied
one Recension and has fully understood its meaning, becomes entitled to
the performance of Vedic acts, even without studying the other
Recensions.

“The purpose of the Scripture is the same in all cases; even though
there may be some difference in the order of a few words and syllables,
yet the main feature of the Scripture remains the same. Then again, as
for the understanding of the meaning, this is obtained by the due
comprehension of the meanings of words and reasonings; now, neither the
meanings of words, nor the reasonings, differ in the different
Recensions. So that the means by which one learns the meaning of one
Recension serves the same purpose in regard to the other Recensions
also; and one does not stand in need of any other learning; so that if
One Recension has been learnt, all become learnt.”

True. Such Agnihotra, etc., as are enjoined in one Recension may not
differ from the same acts as enjoined in other Recensions; but there are
certain actions which are not enjoined at all in certain Recensions.
*E.g*., the *Śyena* and other malevolent rites in connection with the
Darśa-pūrṇamāsa are not found in the Aśvalāyana Recension of the Ṛgveda;
nor the Somayāga, the Vājapeva, the Bṛhaspatisava and so forth. So that
when a man has learnt one Recension, he becomes entitled to that
Agnihotra and that Jyotiṣṭoma, etc., which are enjoined iu that
Recension_(;) and if one who has not studied another Recension, and has
neither read nor heard of it, how can he know anything about the acts
enjoined in that other Recension? Nor ore the Soma-sacrifices
compulsory; so that, through fear of incurring the sin of omitting a
compulsory act, one might be forced to seek for the knowledge of them
from other Recensions. As for the ‘Kindling of Fire,’ even though this
also is not found enjoined in the said Āśvalāyana recension of the
Ṛgveda, yet it does contain the injunction of preparing the ‘Āhavanīya’
fire; as is clear from such passages as ‘bring up the Āhavanīya’; so
that, not understanding the meaning of this passage with the help of
ordinary people, the student naturally seeks, from other Recensions, for
the knowledge of what this ‘*Āhavanīya*’ is; and thus he comes to look
over the entire section of the other Recension dealing with the
‘Kindling of Fire.’ Similarly having heard the passage—‘Having offered
either the Amāvāsyā or the Paurṇamāsa libations, etc.,’ one seeks from
other Recensions for the knowledge of the exact form of the two acts (of
Amāvāsyā and Paurṇamāsa offerings). Similarly in the case of other
compulsory and optional acts that have to be performed, when it is found
that some of their details arc not laid down in a certain
Recension,—-such details, for instance, as pertain to the Adhvaryu (and
are mentioned in the Yajurveda) or to the *Udgātṛ* (and are mentioned in
the Sāma-Veda),—the requisite knowledge is sought for from those other
texts. It is not possible for one to know the act that is laid down in
Recensions other than the one studied by him. To the student who learns
several Recensions, and studies their meanings, all this becomes quite
clear. But even in the absence of such knowledge as this last, the
performance of acts is quite possible. Or, such performance could be
possible even on a slight understanding (of the Vedic texts).

The sense of all this is that in the case of one whose learning is
flawless, and who is fit to explain all sciences, such learning
constitutes a title to respect.

‘*Weightier*.’—The comparative ending indicates that the comparison is
between two and two out of the five mentioned. Thus one who is fully
versed in all the fourteeu sciences, is respected through his
‘*learning*,’ even though he he not entitled to it on account of being
lame, blind or poor.

The text points out the relative superiority of these, with a view to
cases where there may *i.e* a conflict among them.—

‘*Among these that which follow is weightier than that which precedes
it*.’ For instance, when one man has vast wealth, and the other has many
relations, then the latter deserves higher respect than the former; for
that which follows is ‘weightier’ than that which precedes it. Similarly
*Age* is weightier than *Relation*. And from this it follows that *Age*
is weightier still than *Wealth*. From all this it is clear that
‘Learning is superior to all, for all Dharma is based upon it,’ as has
been declared by Gautama (6-21—22).

*Objection*.—“Since the preceding factor is not *weighty*, how can we
have the comparative form ‘*weightier*’? It is only when there are two
*weighty* things that one can be called *weightier*; and since in the
present case is, *ex hypothesi*, in relation to something preceding
there can be no *weightiness* in ‘wealth,’ which is not preceded by any
thing else.”

What is meant is that the whole lot of five being ‘weighty’ in common,
the comparative ending is rightly used as showing that one is
*weightier* than the other.

‘*Māna*’ means *respect*; ‘*sthāna*’ means *ground, cause*.

If we adopt the reading ‘*Mānyasthānāni*,’ the term ‘*mānya*’ is to be
explained as having the force of the abstract noun; ‘*mānya*’ standing
for ‘*mānyatva*.’—(136)

It has just been declared that among persons each of whom possesses only
one of the qualifications mentioned, one possessing the latter is to be
regarded as superior to one possessing the former. Now the question
arises—between two persons, one of whom possesses two former
qualifications and the other possesses only one latter qualification,
who is to be treated as superior? The following verse answers this
question.

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 474), where we
find the following notes:—‘*Vittam*’ stands for *wealth acquired by
lawful* means;—‘*bandhuḥ*’ for *uncles* and others;—‘*vayaḥ*’ for *older
age*;—‘*karma*’ for acts prescribed in the *Śruti* and
*Smṛti*;—‘*vidyā*’ for *true knowledge*;—these are ‘*mānyasthānāni*,’
*i.e. grounds of respectability*. (See note below on 137).

*Aparārka* (p. 159) quotes this verse in support of the view that a man,
though belonging to an inferior caste, deserves to be respected by
another of the superior caste, if the former happens to be possessed of
superior learning and other qualifications.—It is quoted in
*Nṛsiṃhaprasāda* (Saṃskāra, p. 44b);—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra,
p. 106), which explains ‘*mānyasthānāni*’ as ‘grounds of respect, and
adds that ‘learning’ is the highest of these all.

‘*Of these five*’ grounds of respect;—he in whom there are ‘*a* *larger
number*’—not all—‘*deserves respect*.’ And here the mere sequence (or
posteriority) of the qualifications should not be much heeded. For
instance, when one man possesses *wealth* and *relations*, and the other
possesses only *old age*,—the former gets preference over the latter.

But even when there are several qualities present, if they are not of
high degree,—while the single quality possessed by the other person is
of very high degree,—then both are equal; and the larger number do not
get over the latter (superior) qualification.

When the former verse uses the term ‘*weightier*,’ it only means
superiority in comparison to one (not several) of the preceding ones.

When however in one person there are a *larger number of preceding
qualities* and also *of high degree*,—of great excellence,—while in the
other person there are present the same number of *succeeding*
qualities,—so that the number of preceding and succeeding qualifications
(possessed by the two men) are equal,—then, there is no getting over the
one by the other, simply on the ground of precedence (in enumeration);
in this case both are to he regarded as equal.

“Since what the text declares is that he is deserving of respect in whom
the qualities are of high degree,—it would he right to conclude that in
the case just mentioned where the two persons possess an equal *number*
of qualities (hut the preceding ones are of higher degree), the presence
of the preceding set should get over the other.”

Not so; the epithet ‘*of high degree*’ is meant to apply to the case
where the two sets of qualities are equal; *e.g*., where the one as well
as the other is possessed of *learning*, superiority belongs to one
whose learning is of the superior order. Similarly with the other
qualities.

‘*Among the three Castes*,’—*i.e*., among Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and
Vaiśyas. If the said qualities, many in number and of high degree,
belong to the *Kṣatriya*, then such a Kṣatriya deserves to be respected
by the Brāhmaṇa possessed of inferior qualities, even though he belongs
to the higher caste. The Vaiśya, similarly, is to be respected by the
Kṣatriya.

Similarly by all the twice-born castes the *Śūdra* should be respected,
‘*when he has reached the tenth stage*.’ The ‘*tenth*’ stands for the
last stage of life, and indicates *extreme old age*. Thus then, in case
of the Śūdra, ‘wealth’ and ‘relations’ do not constitute grounds of
respect, in relation to tho three higher castes. This is clear from the
fact, that the Text specifies the ‘tenth stage.’ ‘Action’ and ‘Learning’
are not possible in the Śūdra; for the simple reason that he is not
entitled to these.

‘*Most*’;—all that is meant by this is *excess*, not *plurality of
number* (which would mean at least *three*); hence what is asserted
applies to tho presence of qualities also. There is nothing to justify
the notion that the term ‘*bahu*’ (from which ‘*bhūyāmsi* is derived’)
denotes *number*. Further, the term actually used is ‘*bhūyaḥ*,’ not
‘*bāhu*’; and the former is often found to be used in the sense of
*excess, much*: *e.g*., ‘*bhūyāṅśchātra parihāro*,’ ‘there is *much*
that can be said in answer to this,’ ‘*bhūyābhyudayena yokṣye,'* ‘I
shall become endowed with *much* prosperity.’ Nor is any significance
meant to be attached to the plural number in ‘*bhūyāmsi*’; the plural
number in this case denoting only *kind*, according to Pāṇini 3.2.58,
which lays down that ‘when a kind or genus is spoken of, the plural
number is optionally used.’ If significance were really meant to be
attached to the plural number, then a person possessed of only one
quality (of however high degree) would never be entitled to respect; and
this would run counter to what we h ave learnt from the foregoing verse.
Furthor, by speaking of —‘*the Śūdra who has reached the tenth
stage*’—where mere *age* (only one quality) is mentioned as a ground of
respect,—the Text has made it clear that no significance is meant to be
attached to the plural number (in ‘*bhūyāmsi*’). Usage also points to
the same conclusion.—(1.37)

<details><summary>गङ्गानथ-टिप्पन्यः</summary>

This verse is quoted along with verse 136 in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra,
p. 474), which adds the following explanation:—Among the three castes,
Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya, the person who possesses a greater amount
of the preceding qualification (among the five mentioned in 136) is to
be honoured more than one possessed of the succeeding one only. Thus a
person possessed of greater wealth and superior relations is higher than
one only older in age; one possessed of a higher degree of wealth,
relations and age is higher than one superior in action only;—one
possessed in a higher degree of wealth, relation, age and action is
superior to one possessing learning only;—‘*guṇavanti*’ means
*superior*; which means that between two persons possessing wealth, he
is higher whose wealth is *superior*; and the ‘superiority’of wealth
would consist in its having been acquired by lawful means and such other
circumstaṇces. In the case of ‘relations,’ this superiority would
consist in being more intimate and so forth;—in the case of ‘age’ it
would consist in being very much older;—in that of ‘action,’ in its
being equipped with all auxiliary details;—in that of ‘learning,’ in its
being acquired in the prescribed manner.—‘*Tenth stage*’ stands for the
age over ninety years; the hundred years of man’s life being divided
into ten equal spans, the tenth one coming after the ninetieth
year;—-when he has reached this age, the Śūdra also becomes entitled to
honour at the hands of the twice-born.

The last foot of the verse regarding the ‘tenth stage’ is quoted on p.
453 also, as declaring the respectability of the Śūdra.

This verse is quoted in *Aparārka* (p. 159), where ‘*daśamī*’ is
explained as ‘the last ten years of the hundred years’;—‘*bhūyāṃsi*’ as
to *number* and ‘*guṇavanti*’ as to *degree*;—hence without considering
the caste, one possessed of superior learning is to he respected by
another possessed of less; or one who knows more subjects is to be
respected by another knowing a lesser number; similarly in regard to
‘*karma*’ and other qualifications also;—in *Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 48),
which explains ‘*daśamīm gataḥ*’ as ‘over ninety years of age,’ and
‘*pañchānām*’ as ‘among learning and the rest’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā*
(Saṃskāra, p. 106), which explains ‘*daśamī*’ as ‘the last part of
hundred years, *i*. *e*. beyond ninety years,’ and adds that ‘old age’
is meant to be indicative of the presence of wealth and the rest also.

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra* (10.6).—‘The Śūdra also if he has children and is
over 80 years in age.’

*Yājñavalkya* (1.116).—‘When the said qualities (of Learning, etc.) are
present in a very large degree, the Śūdra also deserves respect, when he
has reached old age.’

Another method of showing respect is also described by the way.

‘*Chakrin*’ is the person in a chariot, one who is occupying a cart or
some such conveyance. For him ‘*way should be made*.’ ‘*Way*’ is that
path, that part of the Earth, by which one goes to a village and such
other places; while one is on such a ‘way,’ if a man in a chariot should
happen to come either in front of him or behind him, then the man on
foot should move off from the spot where he might be obstructing the
passing of the cart.

‘*One who is in the tenth stage of life*’—one who is far advanced in
age.

‘*One suffering from a disease*’—one who is suffering very badly from
some malady.

‘*One who is carrying* a *burden*’—one who is carrying grains and other
heavy things; such a man also finds it difficult to move, and hence must
bo favoured.

‘*A woman*,’—*i.e*., simply by reason of her being a woman, irrespective
of her caste or qualifications, or of the position of her husband.

‘*King*’—stands here for the master of a kingdom, not for the mere
*Kṣatriya*. For in the conclusion (which comes in the next verse) we
have the term ‘*Pārthiva*’ which means the ‘lord of the Earth,’
‘*pṛthivyāḥ īśvaraḥ*.’

*Objection*.—“In as much as in the opening verse (the present) we have
the term ‘*rājan*,’ it would be more reasonable to interpret the term
‘*parthiva*’ (in the next verse) in accordance with, and as standing
for, the ‘*Rājā*’ (than that ‘Rājā’ should be taken as standing for the
‘*pārthiva*’), and the word ‘*Rājan*’ is well-known as denoting the
*Kṣatriya* caste; and as this forms the principal denotation of the
term, it should be accepted in the opening of the passage, specially as
there does not appear to be any incongruity in it. In the next verse,
where the relative merits are mentioned, it is quite possible to take
the term ‘*parthiva*’ as referring to the *Kṣatriya*; in view of the
fact that the ‘protecting of the Earth,’ which is connoted by the term
‘*pārtiva*.’ is a duty prescribed specifically for the *Kṣatriya*. So
that it cannot be right, to take the term as referring to other castes,
merely on the strength of their being ‘*in possession of land*’
(‘*pṛthīvyāḥ* *īśvaraḥ*’).”

To the above we make the following reply:—What is asserted here (in the
next verse) is *capability being respected*;—when, *e.g*., the person
who has just passed out of hi s studentship is described as deserving to
be honoured by a king. Under verse 35, it has been pointed out that the
term ‘*bhūmipa*’ stands for the *Kṣatriya* caste; and since the Kingly
caste is merely indicative, what is mentioned here is understood to
pertain to such a Kṣatriya as happens to be the ‘lord of men.’

The ‘*bridegroom*’—who is going to marry. For these persons ‘*way should
be made*;’—what is meant by ‘*deyaḥ*,’ ‘*should be made*,’ is simply
that one should give up the road; and as ‘giving up’ only means *moving
off* (and not actual *giving*), the Dative ending has not been
used.—(138)

This verse is quoted in *Vīramitrodaya* (Saṃskāra, p. 76);—in
*Saṃskāramayūkha* (p. 48), which explains ‘*varaḥ*’ as ‘one who is going
to marry’;—and in *Smṛticandrikā* (Saṃskāra, p. 107), which has the
following notes—‘*chakrin*,’ one who is driving in a cart,—‘*snātaka*,’
the student who has completed his course of studentship,—‘*varaḥ*,’ one
who is going to marry;—when one meets any of these, he should make way
for him, *i.e*., move away from his path,—among those mentioned here,
the Accomplished Student and the King deserve to be respected by the
‘others’, as stated in the next verse.

**(verses 138-139)

*Vaśiṣṭha-Smṛti* (13.25, 26).—‘Among the following—an aged person, a
child, a sick person, a man carrying a load, a woman, a man driving in a
chariot,—the succeeding should make way for the preceding; when the King
and the Accomplished Student meet, the king should make way for the
student; all should make way for a bride who is being married.’

*Gautama-Dharmasūtra*, 6. 25, 26.—‘One on a chariot, a man in the tenth
stage of life, one who deserves kindness (*i.e*., the sick), a bride, an
Accomplished Student, and the King,—for these way should he made; the
King should make way for the Vedic scholar.’

*Baudhāyana-Dharmasūtra*, 2. 3. 50 (also Devala quoted in
Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 476).—‘Way should he made for the Brāhmaṇa,
the cow, the king, the blind person, the aged, the man suffering under a
load, a pregnant woman and a weak person.’

*Āpastamba-Dharmasūtra*, 2. 2. 57.—‘Way should be made for the King
until he meets the Brāhmaṇa; but when he meets the Brāhmaṇa, way should
be made for the latter. All men should make way for a conveyance, for
one carrying a load, one struck with disease, and a woman; to one of
superior caste; and also to the Renunciate, and the intoxicated and the
lunatic,—these latter for the sake of one’s own safety.’

*Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, 6.475).—‘Way should be made
for the dumb, the blind, the deaf, the intoxicated, the lunatic, the
loose woman, one’s enemy, a child and the outcast.’

*Śaṅkha-Likhita* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 476).—‘Way should be made
for the child, the aged, the intoxicated, the lunatic, one struck with a
foul disease, one carrying a load, a woman who is pregnant, the
Accomplished Student, the Renunciate, and also persons excelling in
learning, arts and other qualities.’

*Yājñavalkya* (Vīramitrodaya-Saṃskāra, p. 476).—‘Way should be made for
the aged, the man with a load, the King, the Accomplished Student, a
woman, the sick, the bridegroom, the man on a chariot; among these the
King deserves special honour; but the Accomplished Student deserves
honour even from the King.’
